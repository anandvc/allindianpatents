BACKGROUND Field of Invention<br>
The invention generally relates to authentication, and more particularly to digital authorization of entities using sound.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
With the growth of electronic commerce, use of public communication infrastructure, such as the Internet, to access various secure networks, systems and/or applications has also grown. For example, users may gain access to banks (online or by automatic teller machines (ATM)), a private network such as an intranet, a secure server or database, and/or other virtual private network (VPN) over a public communication infrastructure by digital authentication.<br>
However, with the introduction of a system of communication wherein face-to-face contact is not possible, opportunities for fraudulent or unauthorized access have increased. Misappropriated identity in the hands of wrongdoers may cause damage to individuals, organizations or other entities.<br>
To prevent unauthorized access, various security schemes have been developed to verify user or entity identification such that only authorized entities are given access. One technique for user authentication and access control can be implemented by a access code generating device, such as a token. Here, a unique access code is periodically generated displayed to a user. Typically, the access code is generated from an algorithm that is based on a secure information and the current time. The user is then required to input the currently displayed access code to gain access.<br>
In some systems, a password is also required to gain access. These types of systems are known as the two-factor authentication. Two-factor authentication is typically based on something that a user has, for example the token, and something that a user knows, such as the password. Because both pieces of information are used to authenticate a user, systems implementing the two-factor authentication may be less susceptible to attacks than a single-factor authentication.<br>
While a token as described above may prevent unauthorized access, it is cumbersome because users must manually enter each access code during each access. Also, errors are more likely to occur due to the manual input of the access code. In<br><br>
some systems, a user is required to input the access code more than once during each access, which increases the inconvenience and possibility of errors. Furthermore, because the access code may be based on time and is continuously displayed, a constant computation may be required by the token, thereby shortening the battery life of the token.<br>
Therefore, there is a need for a more efficient, more convenient and/or more secure way to implement a control access system using a device.<br>

Figure 1 shows an example system 100 for digital authentication over an acoustic channel. In system 100, a verifier device 110 controls access to a secure network, system and/or application over a public communication infrastructure such as the Internet 120. Although access may be gained through a public communication infrastructure other than Internet 120, for purposes of explanation, system 100 will be described with reference to Internet 120.<br>
To gain access over Internet 120, a device such as a token 130 provides an access code to verifier device 110 through a wireless communication device (WCD) 140. The access code is communicated from token 130 to WCD 140 through an acoustic channel. The access code is generated using a cryptographic key that is securely stored within token 130 and is encoded into sound waves for communication. More particularly, multi-carrier modulation is used to encode the generated access code into multiple tones and corresponding multi-carrier demodulation is used to recover the access code from the multiple tones.<br><br>
User of token 130 may also provide a user information such as a usemame to verifier device 110. Here, the user information may be encoded into sound waves and communicated along with the access code to WCD 140. Alternatively, the user information may be entered directly into WCD 140. WCD 140 may then forward the access code and user information to verifier device 110 over Internet 120 for authentication. In still another alternative embodiment, the user information may be an assigned identification number of token 130. Thus, a user need not input the user information. The identification number is encoded automatically into sound waves along with the access code and communicated to WCD 140. Once access is granted, WCD 140 may be used to communicate with the secure network or system.<br>
To forward the access code and/or user information, WCD 140 may recover the access code and/or user information, if encoded, from the sound waves. WCD 140 may then forward the access code and/or user information to verifier device 110. Alternatively, the sound waves encoded the access code and the sound waves encoded with the user information, if encoded, may be transmitted to verifier device 110. The access code and/or user information may then be recovered from the sound waves by verifier device 110. Here, the access code and user information, or the sound waves encoded with the access code and/or user information, may be transmitted using any known communication technology that allows access to fotemet 120 in system 100.<br>
Token 130 is typically a portable device that may be small enough to be carried in pockets and/or attached to a key chain. Physical possession of token 130 provides an aspect of the required verification, in the same manner that the physical possession of a key allows an individual to gain access through a locked door. Therefore, token 130 serves as an authentication tool and, other than communication by sound waves, token 130 need not have the conventional wireless communication capabilities to directly transmit an access code to verifier device 110 over Internet 120 or over other wireless and non-wireless infrastructures. Namely, in some embodiments, token 130 does not support wireless telecommunication capabilities; and does not include a wireless modem, network card and/or other wireless links to a private or public communication infrastructure such as Internet 120. As a result, the access code is transmitted over Internet 120 by WCD 140. It is to be noted, however, that in alternative embodiments, token 130 may be embedded into another device such as a wireless phone or a personal data assistant. Also, although WCD 140 is shown as a personal desktop computer, it<br><br>
may be various other computing devices such as but is not limited to laptop computer, PDAs, wireless phones or security devices of homes, offices or vehicles.<br>
The access code is generated using a cryptographic key that is securely stored within token 130. The cryptographic key may be placed into token 130 at manufacture and is not known by the user. Here, two types of cryptographic keys may be used for digital authentication, symmetric cryptographic system and asymmetric cryptographic system. In symmetric cryptographic system, the secret key or symmetric key that is kept secret within token 130 is shared and placed in verifier device 110. Token 130 generates a digital signature using a secret key and the digital signature is sent to verifier device 110 for authentication. Verifier device 110 verifies the digital signature based the same secret key. In asymmetric cryptographic system, a private key and a public key are generated for a user. The public key is shared with verifier device 110 while the private key is kept secret within token 130, A digital signature is generated using the private key and sent to verifier device 110. Verifier device 110 then verifies the digital signature based on the user's public key.<br>
In the above description, verifier device 110 identifies the cryptographic key that corresponds to a user based on the user information sent with the access code. Also, verifier device 110 may be implemented as part of the secure network or system into which a user wants access. Alternatively, verifier device 110 may be located externally from the secure network or system. Moreover, although Figure 1 show one verifier device 110, it would be apparent to those skilled in the art that there may be more than one verifier device, each controlling access to one or more networks/systems.<br>
Figure 2 shows a block diagram of an example embodiment of a token 200 and Figure 3 shows an example embodiment of a corresponding verifier device 300. Token 200 may comprise a storage medium 210 configured to store a cryptographic key and a Look-up Table (LUT), a processor 220 configured to generate an access code using the cryptographic key, a converter 230 configured to convert the access code into multiple tones encoded with the access code using the LUT, and an audio output unit 240 configured to output the multiple tones encoded with the access code for verification. Verifier device 300 may comprise a storage medium 310 configured to store a cryptographic key, a processor 320 configured to generate an access code using the cryptographic key, an audio input unit 330 configured to receive multiple tones encoded with an access code fi:om a token, and a converter 340 configured to recover the access<br><br>
code from the multiple tones. Based on the cryptographic key, processor 320 authenticates the access code of the user.<br>
More particularly, an access code is converted to and from multiple tones based on multi-carrier modulation. Therefore, converter 230 modulates the access code into multi-carrier signals and converter 340 demodulates the access code from multi-carrier signals using a multi-carrier system. A multi-carrier system is described in co-pending U.S. Application No. 10/356,144 and co-pending U.S. Application No. 10/356,425. In multi-carrier modulation, data stream to be transmitted is divided into multiple interleaved bit streams. This results in multiple parallel bit streams having a much lower bit rate. Each bit stream is then used to modulate multiple carriers and transmitted over separate carrier signals. Typically, multi-carrier modulation involves encoding, interleaving, digital modulating. Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) processing and up-converting the data stream to be transmitted. Demodulation involves down-converting, EFT processing, digital demodulating, de-interleaving and decoding the received data stream. In converters 230 and 340, however, the LUT is used to facilitate modulation as described below.<br>
Converter 230 of token 200 may comprise an encoding module 232, an interleaver 234, a binary phase shift keying (BPSK) module 236 and a processor 238. Converter 340 of verifier device 300 may comprise a down converter 341, a FFT module 343, a BPSK module 345, a de-interleaver 347 and a decoding module 349. BPSK is a known technique of digital modulation that is simple to implement. Although BPSK does not result in the most efficient use of an available bandwidth, it is less susceptible to noise. Therefore, BPSK is used for converting the code symbols into tones. However, modulation techniques other than BPSK may be implemented in converters 230 and 340. Also, it should be noted that converter 230 shows a simplified multi-carrier modulator based on BPSK. A more typical conunercial multi-carrier modulator may have additional components such as a preamble generator, a serial to parallel (S/P) converter or parallel to serial (P/S) converter. Similarly, converter 340 shows a simplified multi-carrier demodulator corresponding to converter 230, and a more typical commercial multi-carrier demodulator may also have additional components such as a synchronization unit, a S/P converter and a P/S converter.<br>
Generally, encoding module 232 is configured to encode the bit stream or bit stream of the access code. The encoded bit stream are then interleaved into interieaved bit streams or code symbols by interleaver 234. BPSK module 236 is configured to<br><br>
generate multiple parallel BPSK symbols from the code symbols. More particularly, the encoded bit stream are converted from serial to parallel into parallel code symbols. The parallel code symbols are then mapped by BPSK module 236 into multiple parallel BPSK symbols. Here, the code symbols may be mapped into BPSK symbols and then converted from serial to parallel BPSK symbols, or the code symbols may be converted from serial to parallel and then mapped into BPSK symbols. Also, the number of BPSK symbols correspond to the number of tones available in the multi-carrier system. In some embodiments, the multi-carrier tones have frequencies in the range from about 1 kHz to 3 kHz and the bandwidth allowed for each carrier would depend on the number of tones. For example, if the number of available tones is 64, a bandwidth of about 31.25 Hz would be allowed for each carrier. The multiple BPSK symbols generated as described above are converted into multiple tones using the LUT and converted from parallel to serial by processor 238. By implementing the LXJT, BPSK symbols may directly be converted into multiple tones without lEFT processing and up-conversion. Detail operations of the LTJT will be described below with reference to Figures 5. To recover the access code, converter 340 would perform a process that is inverse to the process performed by converter 230. Namely, down converter 341 is configured to demodulate the multiple tones into multiple parallel IFFT symbols, FFT module 343 is configured to perform FFT to generate multiple parallel BPSK symbols, BPSK module^ 345 is configured to convert the BPSK symbols into code symbols or encoded interleaved bit stream of the access code, de-interleaver 347 is configured to de-interleave the code symbols, and decoding module 349 is configured to recover the access code from the encoded code symbols. More particularly, the down converter 341 may demodulate the multiple tones into IFFT symbols, a S/P may convert the IFFT symbols from serial to parallel, FFT module 343 may perform FFT to generate multiple parallel BPSK symbols, BPSK module 345 may convert the BPSK symbols into multiple parallel code symbols, de-interleaver 347 may de-interleave the code symbols into encoded bit stream, and a P/S may convert the code symbols from parallel to serial to be decoded by decoding module 349. Alternatively, the multiple tones may be converted from serial to parallel, FFT processed into multiple parallel BPSK symbols, converted from parallel to serial, and BPSK processed for de-interleaving. Still alternatively, the multiple tones may be converted from parallel to serial, FFT processed into multiple parallel BPSK symbols, BPSK processed into multiple parallel code symbols, converted from parallel to serial, and de-interleaved.<br><br>
As in converters 230 and 340, a more typical token and verifier device may have additional components. In some embodiments, token 200 may also comprise an amplifier 260 configured to amplify the multiple tones ft'om converter 230, and an activator or actuator 270 configured to receive a signal firom a user that activates the authentication procedure. Actuator 260 may be, but is not limited to, a switch, a push¬button switch, a toggle switch or a dial or sound activated device. Token 200 may further comprise a clock module 250 configured to generate a time element. In such cases, processor 220 may be configured to generate an access code using the cryptographic key and the time element. Similarly, verifier device 300 may also comprise a clock module 350 configured to generate the time element. In such cases, processor 320 may be configured to generate an access code using the cryptographic key and the time element.<br>
In token 200 and verifier device 300, clock modules 250 and 350 are synchronized to generate a time element periodically, for example every minute, hour, day or other selected increment as needed. This type of authentication is typically referred to as a session based authentication since the access code changes with each period of time. Also, storage mediums 210 and 310 may be databases of cryptographic keys corresponding to different users of a network, system or application. Therefore, user information is sent to verifier device 300, as discussed above, such that the appropriate cryptographic key is used at verifier 300 in the authentication procedure.<br>
Figure 4 shows an example method 400 for transmitting an access code using an acoustic channel. For access to a secure network, system or application, an access code is generated (410) by processor 220 using a cryptographic key. Thereafter, multiple parallel BPSK symbols are generated (420) based upon the access code, and the BPSK symbols are converted (430) into multiple tones encoded with the access code using the LXJT. More particularly, the bit stream of the access code is encoded into encoded bit stream. The encoded bit stream may be converted ftom serial to parallel, interleaved into multiple parallel code symbols, BPSK mapped into multiple parallel BPSK symbols, and converted into multiple tones using the LUT. Alternatively, the encoded bit stream may be interleaved, BPSK mapped and then converted fix)m serial to parallel into multiple parallel BPSK symbols for conversion into multiple tones. Still alternatively, the encoded bit stream may be interleaved, and then converted from serial to parallel into multiple parallel code symbols for BPSK processing. Here, the cryptographic key and the LOT may be stored in storage medium 210, and processor<br><br>
238 may convert the BPSK symbols into the multiple tones using the LUT stored in storage medium 210. The multiple tones encoded with the access code is then output (440) for authentication.<br>
More particularly, the LUT is pre-calculated to map the BPSK symbols into designated tones. For example, each particular sequences of BPSK symbols may be mapped and may correspond to one of various available tones. Therefore, rather than performing lEFT on BPSK symbols and modulating the IFFT symbols, the LUT converts the BPSK symbols directly into multiple tones.<br>
In some embodiment, to enhance recovery of an access code, the BPSK symbols are repeated a selected number of times before converting the BPSK symbols. The LUT may then be pre-calculated to map sets of BPSK symbols into multiple tones. Figure 5A to 5C shows an example of a conversion from repeated BPSK symbols into corresponding tones. Assuming a sequence of BPSK symbols {01110010} shown in Figure 5A, a set of two BPSK symbols {01,11,00,10} are repeated twice into repeated BPSK symbols {0101,1111,0000,1010} as shown in Figure 5B. The repeated BPSK symbols can then be found in the LUT for conversion into corresponding tones. Figure 5C shows an example LUT that may be used for converting the twice repeated sets of two BPSK symbols. Here, each one of the LUT entries 0000 -1111 correspond to one of tones T1~T16. Based on the LUT, the repeated BPSK symbols would correspond to tones {T6,T16,T1, Til}.<br>
It should be noted that, the BPSK symbols shown in Figure 5A would correspond to tones {T8, T3}if BPSK symbols are not repeated. Also, if repeated, the BPSK symbols may be repeated more than twice. Moreover, more than two BPSK symbols may be grouped into a set of BPSK symbols and the sets of BPSK symbols may be repeated a selected number of times for conversion into multiple tones. Depending on the number of BPSK symbols grouped in a set and the number of times the set is repeated, the LUT may also be adjusted. For example, a set of three BPSK symbols may be repeated three times. In such case, the LUT may have 512 entries ranging from 000000000 -111111111. Thereafter, the repeated sets of three BPSK symbols may be converted into tones using the LUT.<br>
To further enhance recovery of an access code, reference tones with reference phases may be added to the multiple tones. The reference tones are then output with the multiple tones. Also, the multiple tones may be amplified before outputting the multiple tones. In addition, if a clock module is implemented, the access<br><br>
code is generated by processor 220 using the cryptographic key and a time element. The access code may then be generated, converted and output from token 200 when a user inputs a command through actuator 270.<br>
Figure 6 shows an example method 600 for verifying an access code using an acoustic channel. For verification, multiple tones encoded with an access code is received (610) through audio input module 330. The multiple tones are down-converted or demodulated (620) by down-converter 341 into multiple parallel IFFT symbols. FFT is then performed (630) by EFT module 343 to generate multiple parallel BPSK symbols. The BPSK symbols are converted (640) by BPSK module 345 into encoded interleaved bit stream or code symbols and de-interleaved (650) by de-interleaver 347. More particularly, the multiple tones may be demodulated and converted from serial to parallel into multiple parallel IFFT symbols, FFT processed into multiple parallel BPSK symbols, BPSK mapped into multiple parallel code symbols, and de-interleaved into encoded code symbols. Alternatively, the multiple tones may be demodulated, converted from serial to parallel, IFFT processed, and then converted from parallel to serial into BPSK symbols for de-interleaving. Still alternatively, the multiple tones may be demodulated, converted from serial to parallel, FFT processed, BPSK mapped, and then converted from parallel to serial into multiple parallel BPSK symbols for de-interleaving. Thereafter, the access code is recovered (660) by decoding module 349 from the encoded code symbols. The access code is then verified (670) by processor 320 using the cryptographic key and access is granted (680) if the access code is verified. Here, the cryptographic key may be stored in storage medium 310.<br>
In method 600, if the BPSK symbols are repeated for conversion, the multiple tones are demodulated and FFT processed into repeated BPSK symbols. A selected set of BPSK symbols is then generated from the repeated BPSK symbols and the selected set of BPSK symbols are converted into the code symbols or encoded interleaved bit stiream. Here, BPSK module 345 may generate the selected set of BPSK symbols from the repeated BPSK symbols and convert the selected set into code symbols. Figure 7A to 7D shows an example generation of the selected set of BPSK symbols.<br>
As shown, a set of two BPSK symbols are repeated twice into original BPSK symbols of A1B1A2B2C1D1C2B2 and demodulated into A'1B'1A'2B'2C'1D'1C'2B'2. The selected BPSK symbols can be generated by<br><br>
selecting one of the two set the repeated BPSK symbol as shown in Figure 7C. Alternatively, the selected BPSK symbols can be generated by selecting each BPSK symbol from any one of the repeated sets of BPSK symbols as shown in Figure 7D. It should be noted here that the multiple tones may be converted into sets of more than two BPSK symbols. For example, the multiple tones may be converted into repeated sets of three BPSK symbols. In such case, the selected set of BPSK symbols may be generated by selecting one of each BPSK symbols from the repeated sets of three BPSK symbols. Alternatively, the selected set of BPSK symbols may be generated by selected one of the repeated sets of three BPSK symbols.<br>
Moreover, if reference tones with reference phases are received, the multiple tones are converted into BPSK symbols using the reference tones. Also, if a clock module is implemented, the access code is verified by processor 320 using the cryptographic key and a time element.<br>
In tokens with limited processing power or speed, the LUT may significantly improve the efficiency and performance transmitting an access code using multiple tones. However, some embodiments may not implement and use a LUT. Figure 8 shows another example embodiment of a token 800 that does not use LUT.<br>
Token 800 comprises a storage medium 810 configured to store a cryptographic key, a processor 820 configured to generate an access code using the cryptographic key, a converter 830 configured to convert the access code into multiple tones, and an audio output unit 840 configured to output the multiple tones encoded with the access code for verification. In some embodiments, token 800 may comprise an amplifier 860, an activator or actuator 870, and a clock module 880 as implemented by amplifier 260, actuator 270 and clock module 280 of token 200.<br>
Generally, token 800 implements the same elements as the elements in token 200. However, the modulation by converter 830 is not based on a LUT. Accordingly, it would not be necessary to store a LUT in storage mediums 810. Also, the process of converters 830 is based on the use of repeated BPSK symbols. More particularly, converter 830 of token 800 may comprise an encoding module 831 configured to encode bit stream of the access code, an interleaver 833 configured to interleave the encoded bit stream, a BPSK module 835 configured to convert the interleaved bit stream or code symbols into BPSK symbols and to generate a selected number of repeated sets of BPSK symbols, IFFT module 837 configured to perform<br><br>
IFFT on the repeated BPSK symbols and an up-converter 839 configured to modulate the IFFT symb»ols into multiple tones encoded with the access code.<br>
Accordingly, the encoded bit stream are converted from serial to parallel and mapped into multiple parallel BPSK symbols. A selected number of repeated sets of BPSK symbols are generated from the each parallel BPSK symbols. Namely, multiple parallel repeated sets of BPSK symbols are generated and correspond to the multiple parallel BPSK symbols. The multiple repeated sets of BPSK symbols may then be IFFT processed and converted from parallel to serial for output. Here, the code symbols may be mapped into BPSK symbols and then converted from serial to parallel BPSK symbols, or the code symbols may be converted from serial to parallel and then mapped into BPSK symbols.<br>
Figure 9 shows an example method 900 corresponding to token 800 for transmitting an access code using an acoustic channel. For access to a secure network, system or application, an access code is generated (910) by processor 820 using a cryptographic key. Thereafter, multiple parallel repeated sets of BPSK symbols are generated (920) based upon the access code and IEFT transform is performed (930) to generate IFFT symbols. The IFFT symbols are modulated (940) then into multiple tones encoded with the access code and the multiple tones may be output (980) by audio output unit 840 for authentication. Here, the cryptographic key may be stored in storage medium 810.<br>
More particularly, the bit stream of the access code may be encoded, converted from serial to parallel, interleaved, and BPSK mapped into multiple parallel BPSK symbols. The BPSK symbols of each parallel BPSK symbols are repeated a selected number of times as described with reference to Figures 5A to 5C, thereby generating multiple parallel repeated set of BPSK symbols for IFFT processing. Alternatively, the encoded bit stream may be interleaved, BPSK mapped and then converted from serial to parallel into multiple parallel BPSK symbols for repeating. Still alternatively, the encoded bit stream may be interleaved, and then converted from serial to parallel into multiple parallel code symbols for BPSK processing.<br>
Furthermore, as in token 200, reference tones with reference phases may be added to the multiple tones and the reference tones may be output with the multiple tones. Also, the multiple tones may be amplified before outputting the multiple tones. In addition, if a clock module is implemented, the access code is generated by processor 820 using the cryptographic key and a time element. The access code may then be<br><br>
generated, converted and output from token 800 when a user inputs a command through actuator 870.<br>
While the modulation by converter 830 is not based on the use of a LUT, the demodulation may be performed by verifier device 300 and corresponding method 600 as described with reference to Figures 3 and 6. Accordingly, converter 340 corresponding with converter 830 may comprise down converter 341 configured to demodulate the multiple tones into IFFT symbols, EFT module 343 configured to perform FFT to generate repeated BPSK symbols, BPSK module 345 configured to generate a selected set of BPSK symbols ft'om the repeated BPSK symbols and to convert the selected set of BPSK symbols into code symbols or encoded interleaved bit stream of the access code, de-interleaver 347 configured to de-interleave the code symbols, and a decoding module 349 configured to recover the access code from the encoded de-interleaved bit stream. As in token 200, modulation techniques other than BPSK may also be implemented in converters 830 and 340.<br>
Figure 10 shows an example method 1000 coiresponding to converter 830 for verifying an access code using an acoustic channel. For verification, multiple tones encoded with an access code is received (1010) through audio input module 330. The multiple tones are down-converted or demodulated (1020) by down-converter 341 into IFFr symbols. FFT is then performed (1030) by FFT module 343 to generate repeated BPSK symbols and a selected set of BPSK symbols are generated (1040) from the repeated BPSK symbols. Here, the selected set of BPSK symbols may be generated as described with reference to Figures 7A to 7D. The selected BPSK symbols are converted (1050) by BPSK module 345 into encoded interleaved bit stream or code symbols of the access code. Thereafter, the encoded interleaved bit stream is de-interleaved (1060) by de-interleaver 347 and the access code is recovered (1070) by decoding module 949 from the encoded de-interleaved bit stream. The access code is then verified (1080) by processor 320 using the cryptographic key stored in storage medium 910 and access is granted (1090) if the access code is verified.<br>
As in verifier device 300, if reference tones with reference phases are received, the multiple tones are converted into IFFT symbols using the reference tones. Also, if a clock module is implemented, the access code is verified by processor 320 using the cryptographic key and a time element.<br>
As described above, an access code and/or password may be encoded into multiple tones, transmitted through a public communication infrastructure such as<br><br>
Internet 120, recovered from multiple tones, and verified to access a secure network, system and/or application.<br>
While system 100 show one example, there may be other systems for digital authentication over an acoustic channel. Figures UA to UD show some additional example systems for digital authentication over an acoustic channel. In Figure 11 A, multiple tones encoded with an access code may be output and transmitted from a token 1110 to a receiver device 1120. The access code is then forwarded from receiver device 1120 to a verifier device 1130 through a wireless or non-wireless communication infrastructure 1140. In Figure IIB, the multiple tones encoded with an access code is output and transmitted from token 1110 to receiver device 1120 through a wireless or non-wireless phone 1150. Thereafter, the access code is forwarded from receiver device 1120 to a verifier device 1130 through a wireless or non-wireless communication infrastructure 1140. In Figures llA and IIB, receiver device 1120 is implemented remotely from verifier device 1130. In such cases, receiver device 1120 may be implemented non-remotely or as part of verifier device 1130 as shown in Figure lie. In Figure UC, token 1110 outputs the multiple tones encoded with the access code directly to a receiver/verifier devicel 160. Alternatively, the multiple tones encoded with the access code may be output and transmitted from token 1110 to receiver/verifier 1160 through a wireless or non-wireless phone 1150.<br>
The multiple tones encoded with the access code may thus be forwarded from receiver device 1120 to verifier device 1130, and verifier device 1130 may recover the access code. In some embodiments, the access code may be first be recovered from the multiple tones and then the recovered access code may be forwarded from receiver device 1120 to verifier device 1130 for authentication. Figure 12 shows one example of a receiver 1200 corresponding to token 200 and Figure 13 shows another example of a receiver 1300 corresponding to token 800, for recovering an access code.<br>
Receiver 1200 comprises a storage medium 1210 configured to store a LUT corresponding to the LUT in storage medium 210, an audio input unit 1220 configured to receive multiple tones encoded with an access code from a user of a token, and a converter 1230 configured to recover the access code from the multiple tones using the LUT. Converter 1230 may comprise a processor 1232 configured to convert the multiple tones into BPSK symbols using the LUT, a BPSK module 1234 is configured to perform demodulation based on BPSK to convert the BPSK symbols into code symbols or encoded interleaved bit stream of the access code, a de-interleaver 1236 is<br><br>
configured to de-interleave the code symbols, and a decoding module 1238 is configured to recover the access code from the encoded code symbols.<br>
Receiver 1300 comprises an audio input unit configured to receive sound waves encoded with an access code from a user of a token, and a converter 1320. Converter 1320 may comprise a down converter 1321 configured to demodulate the multiple tones into IBFT symbols, a FFT module 1323 configured to perform FFT to generate repeated BPSK symbols, a BPSK module 1325 configured to generate a selected set of BPSK symbols from the repeated BPSK symbols and to convert the selected set of BPSK symbols into encoded interleaved bit stream of the access code, a de-interleaver 1327 configured to de-interleave the encoded interleaved bit stream, and a decoding module 1329 configured to recover the access code from the encoded de-interleaved bit stream.<br>
Generally, a method corresponding to receiver 1200 for recovering an access code also corresponds to the method described with reference to Figure 6. However, verification of a recovered access code and granting access based on the access code is not performed by receiver 1200. Similarly, a method corresponding to receiver 1300 for recovering an access code also corresponds to the method described with reference to Figure 11. However, verification of a recovered access code and granting access based on the access code is not performed by receiver 1300.<br>
Accordingly, an access code and/or password may be encoded into and recovered from multiple tones. By using the acoustic channel to input an access code for authentication, there is no need for a display or a constant computation needed for displaying an access code, thereby elongating the battery life of a token. Moreover, since the access code is not manually entered by a user, less errors are less likely to occur, especially in a system that requires a user to input an access code more than once during each access. In addition, because a standard speaker and/or microphone may be used, the system can easily be implemented without incurring significant cost.<br>
Finally, embodiments may be implemented by hardware, software, firmware, middleware, microcode, or any combination thereof. When implemented in software, firmware, middleware or microcode, the program code or code segments to perform the necessary tasks may be stored in a machine readable medium such as storage medium 210,310, 810,1210 or a separate storage medium (not shown). A processor such as processor 220, 230, 820 or a separate processor (not shown) may perform the necessary tasks. A code segment may represent a procedure, a function, a subprogram, a program, a routine, a subroutine, a module, a software package, a class, or any combination of<br><br>
instructions, data structures, or program statements. A code segment may be coupled to another code segment or a hardware circuit by passing and/or receiving information, data, arguments, parameters, or memory contents. Information, arguments, parameters, data, etc. may be passed, forwarded, or transmitted via any suitable means including memory sharing, message passing, token passing, network transmission, etc.<br>
Furthermore, it should be apparent to those skilled in the art that the elements of tokens 200 and 800 may be rearranged without affecting the operation of the token. Similarly, the elements of verifier device 300 and/or receivers 1200,1300 may be rearranged without affecting the operations thereof. Li addition, elements of tokens 200, 800; verifier device 300; and/or receivers 1200,1300 may be implemented together. For example, processor 238 may be implemented together with processor 220 and processor 348 may be implemented together with processor 320.<br>
Moreover, in some embodiments, a token may be implemented with a display. Figure 14A shows an example embodiment of a token having a housing element 1410 implemented with a display 1420, actuator 1430 and audio output unit 1440. Figure 14B shows another example embodiment of a token having a housing element 1450 implemented with a display 1460, an actuator 1470, an audio output unit 1480 and an opening 1480 through housing element 1450.<br>

The description of the embodiments is intended to be illustrative, and not to limit the scope of the claims.
