Description KOKUMI-IMPARTING AGENT<br>
Technical Field<br>
This application claims priority from Japanese Patent Application No. 2005-325300 filed on November 9, 2005 , Japanese Patent Application No. 2006-188458 filed on July 7, 2006, US Provisional Patent Application No. 60/738562 filed on November 22, 2005, US Provisional Patent Application No. 60/807831 filed on July 20, 2006 , which are hereby incorporated by reference herein. •<br>
The present invention relates to a method for screening for a kokumi-imparting substance, a kokumi-imparting agent containing a kokum'i-imparting substance obtained by the screening method as an active ingredient, a method for producing food or drink such as food, seasoning; and drink imparted with kokumi, and food or drink imparted with kokumi.<br>
•Background Art<br>
The calcium receptor is also called the calcium sensing receptor (CaSR),- and is a. receptor consisting of 1078 amino acids, and is classified into the class C of seven-transmembrane receptors (G protein-coupled receptor; GPCR) . Cloning of the gene for this calcium receptor was reported in 1993 (Non-patent document 1), and it is known to cause various cell responses through elevation of intracellular calcium level etc., when it is activated with calcium etc. The gene sequence of the human calcium receptor is registered with GenBank Accession No. NM_000388, and is well conserved in animals.<br>
The aforementioned calcium receptor may act to promote or suppress biological functions. Therefore, at present, therapeutic agents which may act as activators and inhibitors of the calcium receptor are appropriately used<br><br>
in the treatment of neurological diseases, hepatic diseases, cardiovascular diseases, digestive system diseases, and other diseases, depending on pathological conditions. For example, the calcium receptor is able to detect increased blood calcium level in the parathyroid, and suppress secretion of the parathyroid hormone (PTH) to- correct the blood calcium level. Therefore, an effect of reducing the blood calcium level is expected for a calcium receptor activator.  It has been actually clarified that when a calcium receptor activator is used to treat secondary-hyperparathyroidism in a hemodialysis patient, it reduces the PTH level without elevating the calcium and phosphorus  levels.<br>
Since functional analysis of the calcium receptor has been conducted mainly for calcium homeostasis, the applied researches therefore are so far mainly concerned bone  metabolic diseases in which calcium regulation is involved. However, it has become clear that the calcium receptor is widely distributed in living bodies other than the parathyroid and kidney from the results of genetic expression analyses etc. (Non-patent documents 2 and 3), and possibilities thereof for being involved in various biological functions and causes of diseases have been proposed.  For example, it is estimated that the calcium receptor is involved in the functions of the liver, heart, lung, alimentary canal, lymphocyte, and pancreas. The inventors of the present invention also have confirmed that it is expressed in a wide range of tissues in living bodies by analyses based on RT-PCR using RNAs extracted from rat tissues.  From the aforementioned viewpoints, the values of activators and inhibitors of the calcium receptor are presently rapidly increasing for applications.<br>
Moreover, other than calcium, cations such as gadolinium cation, basic peptides such as polyarginine, polyamine such as spermine, amino acids such as phenylalanine, and so forth have been reported as calcium<br><br>
receptor activators (Non-patent document .4).<br>
Although many specific activators have been developed so far as calcium receptor activators as described above, there are few compounds existing in .living bodies among them, and the activities of the compounds existing in living bodies are very low. Therefore, therapeutic agents for various diseases containing these activators have serious problems concerning side reaction, permeability and activity.  For example, although it is known that amino acids act on the calcium receptors, it is considered that actual application thereof as the activators is difficult since the activity is- very weak'. Moreover, although  macromolecules such as polyarginine have been reported-'as . the activator as described above, it is estimated that the functions are based on the actions'as polyvalent cations having irregular structures. That is, it is not known that '.  a peptide having a specific structure is useful as a' calcium receptor activator.<br>
Meanwhile, in the.field of foodstuffs, taste substances have been applied.-for many years.  In particular,, substances having the five basic tastes, namely, sweet taste, salty taste, sour taste,, bitter taste, and umami (delicious taste), and.substances, enhancing these have . widely been used as seasonings. As a concept of taste that cannot- be expressed with the aforementioned tastes, there is "kokumi".  Kokumi means a taste that cannot be expressed with the five basic tastes, and means a taste that enhances not only the basic tastes but also marginal taste's of the basic tastes, such as thickness, growth (mouthfulness), continuity, and harmony. Several methods for imparting kokumi have been reported so far, and glutathione (Patent document 1), heated products of gelatin- and tropomyosin (Patent document 2), sulfone group-containing compounds (Patent document 3), a peptide containing the Asn-His sequence (Patent document 4), and so forth have been reported.<br><br>
Although development of various kokumi-imparting substances has been attempted as described above, and commercialization has been made mainly for extracts of natural products, there are presently very few examples of isolation of a pure kokumi component from an extract of natural product, such as glutathione and N-(4-methyl-5-oxo-l-imidazolin-2-yl)sarcosine.<br>
Therefore, the development of highly effective, safe and inexpensive kokumi-imparting substances is desired, and a convenient and highly sensitive method for.screening for a kokumi-imparting substance is needed for that purpose.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Hereafter, the present invention will be explained in detail.<br>
In this specification, the "calcium receptor" is also called the calcium sensing receptor (CaSR), and belongs to<br><br>
the class C of seven-transmembrane&gt;receptors. in this specification, the "calcium receptor activity" means binding to the aforementioned calcium receptor to activate the guanine nucleotide binding protein and 'thereby transmit signals.  Furthermore, in this specification, the "calcium receptor activator" is a substance that acts on the aforementioned calcium receptor to activate the calcium receptor and control the functions of cells expressing the calcium receptor.<br>
In this specification, "kokumi" means a taste that cannot be expressed by the five basic tastes, sweet taste, salty taste, sour taste,.' bitter taste, and umami,. in which, not only the basic tastes, marginal tastes' of the basic tastes, such as thickness, growth (mouthfulness), continuity, and harmony are enhanced.  Further, the "kokumi-imparting agent" or "kokumi-imparting substance" . refers to an agent or substance that can enhance the'five . basic tastes, sweet taste, salty taste, sour taste, bitter taste, and umami, and impart marginal tastes of the basic tastes, such as thickness, growth (mouthfulness), continuity, and'harmony accompanying the basic tastes. Therefore, the kokumi-imparting agent of the present invention can also be used as a sweet taste-enhancing agent, salty taste-enhancing agent, sour taste-enhancing agent, bitter taste-enhancing agent, or umami-enhancing agent. As for intensity of kokumi, "first and middle taste" means taste that is felt during the period of 0 to 4 seconds after eating, and "aftertaste" means taste that is felt after 5 seconds following eating.<br>
In this specification, all the amino acids and amino acid residues constituting the peptides are L-isomers, unless otherwise specified.<br> Method for screening for kokumi-imparting substance<br>
The method for screening for a kokumi-imparting substance of the present invention (henceforth also<br><br>
referred to as the screening method of the present invention) is characterized by using the calcium receptor activity as an index. Specifically, the screening method of the present invention comprises the first-step of reacting a calcium receptor and a test substance and detecting calcium receptor activity, and the second step of measuring the kokumi-imparting effect of the test substances for which calcium receptor activation activity is detected in the first step.<br>
The specific process steps of the screening method of the present invention are exemplified below. However, the steps of the screening method of the present invention are not limited to these steps.<br>
1)	A test substance is added to a calcium receptor activity measurement system for measuring the calcium receptor activity, and the calcium receptor activity is measured.<br>
2)	The calcium receptor activity obtained with adding the test substance and the calcium receptor activity obtained without adding the test substance are compared.<br>
3) A test substance showing a higher calcium receptor-stimulating activity when the test substance is added is chosen.<br>
4) The kokumi-imparting effect of the chosen test substance is measured, and a test substance having a kokumi-imparting effect is chosen.<br>
The calcium receptor activity is measured by using, for example, a measurement system using cells expressing the calcium receptor. The cells may be cells endogenously expressing the calcium receptor, or recombinant cells introduced with a foreign calcium receptor gene. As the aforementioned calcium receptor activity measurement system, any system may be used without particular limitation so long as chosen is a system with which when an extracellular ligand (activator) specific to the calcium receptor is added to the cells expressing the calcium receptor, binding (reaction) of the activator and the calcium receptor can be<br><br>
detected, or a detectable signal is transmitted into cells in response to binding (reaction) of the activator and the calcium receptor. When the reaction of tested compound result calcium receptor activity; such tested compound are determined as having calcium receptor activation activity and kokumi-imparting compound.<br>
The aforementioned kokumi-imparting effect can be confirmed by a taste test by a human, or the like. Furthermore, the test substance used for the screening is not particularly limited, and low molecular compounds, saccharides, peptides, proteins, and so forth can be .used. As the aforementioned calcium receptor, the human calcium receptor encoded by the human calcium receptor gene registered with GenBank Accession No. NM_000388 can be exemplified as a preferred example.  In addition, the calcium receptor is not limited to the protein encoded by  the gene of the aforementioned sequence, and it may be a protein encoded by a gene having a homology of -60% or more, preferably 80% or more, more preferably 90% or more, to the aforementioned sequence, so long as. the protein has the calcium receptor function. The GPRC6A receptor and the 5.24 receptor are also known as subtypes of the calcium receptor, and they can be used for the present invention. The calcium receptor function can be examined by expressing a gene of interest in a cell and measuring changes in the electric current, or intracellular calcium ion concentration at the time of the addition of calcium.<br>
The origin of the calcium receptor is not particularly limited, and examples include, besides the aforementioned human calcium receptor, calcium receptors derived from animals such as mouse, rat, and dog.<br>
As described above, the calcium receptor activity can be confirmed by using live cells which express a calcium receptor or a fragment thereof, cell membranes which express a calcium receptor or a fragment thereof, an in vitro system containing a protein of a calcium receptor or<br><br>
a fragment thereof, or the like. <br>
An example using live cells is shown below. However, confirmation of the calcium receptor activity is not limited to this example.<br>
The calcium, receptor can be expressed in cultured cells such as Xenopus  laevis  oocytes, hamster ovarian cells, and human fetal kidney cells. The calcium receptor can be expressed by cloning a calcium receptor gene in a plasmid that can contain a foreign gene and introducing the plasmid or cRNA obtained by using the plasmid as a. template.' To detect the reaction, electrophysiological techniques,-fluorescent indicator- reagents that indicate elevation of intracellular calcium level, and so forth, can be used.<br>
Expression of the calcium receptor is first confirmed based on the response to calcium or a specific activator. Oocytes that showed intracellular current with calcium at a- concentration of about 5 M or cultured cells that showed, fluorescence of the fluorescent indicator reagent with calcium at a concentration of about 5 mM are used. Calcium concentration dependency is determined by changing the calcium concentration. Then, a test substance such-as a peptide is prepared to a concentration of about 1 pM to 1 mM, and added to the oocytes or cultured cells, and. the. calcium receptor activity of the test substance such as the aforementioned peptide is measured.<br> Kokumi-imparting agent<br>
The kokumi-imparting agent of the present invention comprises a kokumi-imparting substance obtainable by the screening method of the present invention as an active ingredient. The kokumi-imparting agent of the present invention contains, for example, one or more kinds of substances selected from y-Glu-X-Gly (X represents an amino acid or amino acid derivative except for Cys), Y~Glu-Val-Y (Y represents an amino acid or amino acid derivative), Y-Glu-Ala, y-Glu-Gly, y-Glu-Cys, y-Glu-Met, y-Glu-Thr, y-Glu-<br><br>

These peptides and amino acids can also be obtained by the screening method mentioned above.  Here, "amino, acid" means, but not limited to, neutral amino acids such as Gly, Ala, Val, Leu, lie, Ser, Thr, Cys, Met, Asn, Gin, Pro and Hyp, acidic amino acids such as Asp and Glu, basic amino acids such as Lys, Arg and His, aromatic, amino acids such as Phe, -Tyr, Trp, and other amino acids such as  Homoserine/ Citrulline, Ornithine, alpha-Aminobutylic acid, Norvaline, Norleucine and Taurine.<br>

• For evaluation of calcium receptor activation activity, a Ca ion concentration-dependent CI ionic current measuring method using a Xenopus  laevis  oocyte expression system was used. ' If each activator is added to Xenopus laevis  oocytes expressing the calcium receptor, intracellular Ca ions increase. Then, the Ca ion concentration-dependent CI channel opens, and the intracellular current value changes as an ionic current. By measuring the change in this intracellular current value, whether the calcium receptor activation activity is present or not can be known.<br>
Specifically, the abdomen of Xenopus  laevis  was opened, and an egg batch was taken out and treated with a 1% collagenase solution at 20°C for 2 hours to obtain individual oocytes. Into the oocytes, 50 nl of 1 pg/pl receptor cRNA or 50 nl of sterilized water per one oocyte was introduced by using a micro glass capillary, and the oocytes were cultured at 18°C for 2 or 3 days. For the culture, a solution obtained by adding 2 mM pyruvic acid, 10 U/ml of penicillin, and 10 pg/ml of streptomycin to the<br><br>
solution mentioned in Example 2 was used.. After the culture, a test solution was added to the oocytes introduced with cRNA or sterilized water.<br>
Electrophysiological measurement was performed by using an amplifier, Geneclamp500 (Axon), and recording software, AxoScope 9.0 (Axon). The oocytes were voltage-clamped at -70 mV by the double electrode voltage clamp method, and the intracellular current was measured via the Ca ion concentration-dependent CI ion channel. The maximum value of the intracellular current was considered as the response current value.<br>

Industrial Applicability<br>
By the present invention, it has become clear that the specific amino acids and .peptides having calcium receptor activation activity are also, useful ,as kokumi-imparting substances.  In particular, as shown in Examples 12 to 21, several kinds of dipeptides and tripeptides were newly discovered as kokumi-imparting substances, and'since they are peptides, they can be used in the field of foodstuffs in which high safety is demanded.  In addition, since a method for screening for a kokumi-imparting substance utilizing calcium receptor activation as an index has been developed, so-called high throughput screening can be used, and thus development of a'still more highly, efficient kokumi substance has become possible.<br>
