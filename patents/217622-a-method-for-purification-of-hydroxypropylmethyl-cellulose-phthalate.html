				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method for purification of hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose phthalate. More particularly, the invention relates to a method of preparing high-purity hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose phthalate through a simple crushing process which comprises increasing fluidity of reaction product mixture by adding fluidization solvent as a post-treatment process; and spraying it into water through a spray nozzle. As a result, formation of fine granular hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose phthalate particles prevents inter-particle coagulation during the post-treatment process, and phthalic anhydride reactant, free phthalic acid and remaining acetic acid solvent can be removed effectively.<br>
Background of the invention:<br>
Generally, cellulose and its derivatives are used for pharmaceuticals, foods, cosmetics and construction additives. Among these, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose phthalate is used as a filler of enteric coatings, because it is relatively stable in acidic condition. This hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose phthalate is prepared by esterification of hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose with phthalic anhydride in the presence of sodium acetate in acid solvent to bind phthalic acid to one end of the cellulose molecule. One of such examples is US Patent No. 3,629,237, which discloses a method of preparing hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose phthalate by mixing hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose phthalic anhydride and sodium acetate in acetic acid solvent, carrying out reaction at 80°C for 5hr, and making the product mixtures as slurry in water.<br>
In this method, it is more important to remove, free phthalic acid, and residual acetic_acid_s.olvent through a suitable post-treatment rather than the synthesis itself, in order to obtain pure granular hydipxypropy lmethyl cellulose phthalate.    It is because if acetic acid and free phthalic acid are present in the reaction product mixture, it becomes very hard during drying process.    As a result, crushing of final product becomes very difficult, and the product may be yellowed or it may smell of acetic acid.    Also, when tablets or pellets are coated with a filler, the coating solution is not formed easily due to low solubility and the product stability becomes poor because of decomposition, due to acetic acid or free phthalic acid.   Therefore, it is essential to entirely remove acetic acid and to reduce free phthalic acid content:   Because free phthalic acid can be formed from decomposition of phthalyl group in HPMCP it is the most important to reduce free phthalic acid content at early stage. Standard for free phthalic acid regulated by pharmacopeias of many countries is less than 1.0%, and most pharmaceutical companies are demanding much lower standard. What is more, because hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose phthalate is an excipient used as filler like enteric coatings, high-purity product with low impurity level is highly required.<br>
In order to effectively remove these impurities, it is required to prevent coagulation of hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose phthalate particles, so that impurities like phthalic acid and acetic acid present between the particles can contact with water and be washed away.<br>
In the conventional preparing method of hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose phthalate, cold water was poured to the reaction product mixture in order to remove the impurities. However, from this method, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose phthalate in fine powder or granule cannot be obtained because inter-particle coagulation is very severe. This inter-particle coagulation prevents water from penetrating between the particles, so that it becomes difficult to effectively remove phthalic acid and acetic acid. And,<br>
additional  crushing  process  is  required  to  obtain granular product.<br>
As described above, the conventional preparing method of hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose phthalate requires a crushing process in order to effectively remove impurities, which is troublesome in practice. Therefore, it is highly required to include this crushing process in a post-treatment method in a natural way.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a preparing method of high-purity hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose phthalate by forming fine-granular particles to prevent inter-particle coagulation and effectively removing free phthalic acid and acid solvent in the product. STATEMENT OF INVENTION:<br>
Accordingly, the invention provides a method for purification of hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose phthalate comprising the steps of:<br>
a)	reacting hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, alkali acetate, phthalic anhydride and alkali chlorate in an acetic acid. isolvent to obtain hydroxypropylmethyl celluloseMas reaction product mixture,<br>
b)	adding 2-4 wt% of a fluidization solvent to the product of step (a) , the solvent being selected from water and a lower alcohol having C1-C5 carbon atoms,<br>
c)	spraying the product of step (b) into 10-20 wt. % of water through a spray nozzle whose pressurization speed is 3-81/min to obtain fine particles, and<br>
d)	hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose phthalate in high purity by stirring, filtering and drying.<br>
Hereunder is given a more detailed description of the invention.<br>
The present invention is a new technology, of purifying hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose phthalate in high purity for preparing hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose phthalate from low-molecular-weight cellulose or its derivatives wherein a suitable amount of fluidization solvent is added to the reaction product mixture to enhance fluidity of the,reaction product mixture, and it is sprayed into water through a spray nozzle in order to obtain fine-granular particles.<br>
In the present invention, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose phthalate is prepared through synthesis and purification processes. Hereunder is given a more detailed description of each process.<br>
In the synthesis process, lwt.% of hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose is added to 3-6wt.% of cetic acid solvent and dissolved. Then, after adding 0.4-1wt.% of alkali acetate, 0.5-1.3wt.% of phthalic anhydride and 0.01-0.05wt.% of alkali chlorate, the mixture is stirred slowly at 60-85 °C for 4-6hr in order to obtain hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose phthalate.<br>
For said hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, the one whose viscosity in 2%-aqueous solution 3-20 cps and whose chloride content is lower than 0.4% is recommended  For said alkali acetate, sodium acetate or potassium acetate is recommended and, for said alkali chlorate, sodium chlorate or potassium chlorate is recommended] -not chearly worded<br>
In the purification process, remaining unreacted phthalic anhydride and phthalic acid_and.acetic..acid solvent are removed. This process is core of the present invention.. To the reaction product mixture obtained from the synthesis process, 2-4wt.% of fluidization solvent Cfor lwt.% of hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose) is. added and stirred to enhance fluidity_of the reaction product mixture. then. it is sprayed to 10-20wt.% of water through a spray nozzle, stirred for 2-10min, and dried for 4-6hr at 60-75 °C to obtain high-purity hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose phthalate. In this purification process, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose phthalate dissolved in acetic acid becomes solid<br>
when it contacts with water to form fine granular particles, which prevent inter-particle coagulation of hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose phthalate. As a result, free phthalic acid and acetic acid solvent can be removed effectively. For said fluidization solvent, the one selected from water or G1-C5 low alcohols can be used. For said water, purified".water can be used; and for said C1-C5 low alcohols, methanol of ethanol can be used. If the amount of the fluidization solvent is below 2wt.%, impurities like acetic acid and free phthalic acid may remain in hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose phthalate particles; and if it exceeds 4wt.%,     spraying     becomes     impossible     due     to     solidification     of hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose phthalate. Also, if the amount of water to which the reaction product mixture is sprayed is below 10wt.%, the high acetic acid concentration in the reaction product mixture renders dissolution of surface particles of the solid hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose phthalate, which causes re-coagulation of the particles. Otherwise, if it exceeds 20wt.%, a large amount of waste water is generated. For said spray nozzle, the one with 0.5-1.5mm of internal diameter and whose air or nitrogen gas pressurizatiori speed is 3-81/ min is recommended. If the internal diameter of the spray nozzle is smaller than 0.5mm, the productivity becomes poor because only small amount of reaction product mixture can be treated for unit time. Otherwise, if it exceeds 1.5mm, air or nitrogen gas pressurization speed should be increased. And, if the air or nitrogen gas pressurization speed is below 3£/min, the particle size is increased and impurities are held between the particles. Otherwise, if it exceeds 8C/min,     an     excess     amount     of     nitrogen     should     be     used     and hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose phthalate sticks on the reactor wall, so that a large amount of product, is lost.<br>
Hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose phthalate obtained from this method contains 30-34% of phthalyl content and only 0.05-0.2% of free phthalic acid. And, particle size of the purified hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose phthalate is 50-300 meshes (300-50um).<br>
As explained above, the preparing method of purification method of hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose phthalate according to the present invention effectively removes free phthalic acid and reaction solvent remaining in the final product by preventing inter-particle coagulation of hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose phthalate.<br>
