				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the synthesis of optically pure (-S)-hydroxy-y-butyrolactone (Formula-1) from a D-hexose source.(Formula Removed)<br>
More particularly the present invention relates to the said process from a glucose source containing 1,4-linked glucose as substituent.<br>
(5)-3-Hydroxy-y-butyrolactone is an important synthetic intermediate for variety of chiral compounds. They are key intermediate for preparing neuromediater (R)-GABOB (Tetrahedron 1990, 46, 4277), L-carnitine, a health supported agent (WO 99, 05092), atorvastatin, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, a cholesterol lowering drug (Tetrahedron Lett., 1992, 33, 2279) , (5)-3-tetrahydrofuran, an intermediate for AIDS drug (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995, 117, 1181; WO 94, 05, 639). (5)-3-Hydroxy-y-butyrolactone has been reported as a satiety agent (Okukado et al. Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn 1988. 61, 2025) as well as a potentiating agent to neuroleptic drugs (Fuxe et al, US Patent No. 4. 138.484. They are also useful intermediate in synthetic efforts towards natural products. (J. Org. Chem. 1985, 50, 1144, Can. J. Chem. 1987, 65, 195, Tetrahedron Lett.1992, 507.)<br>
The literature search on the present invention has been carried out which reveals that the proposed work is quite feasible and would open up a new methodology for the production of secondary chiral feedstock, (5)-3-hydroxy-y-butyrolactone (HGB) from lactose, maltose and maltodextrin. This approach would have its further application in the efficient synthesis of large family of chiral intermediate without the need to design custom chiral synthesis for each new compound. Besides, the method developed would be able to reduce the cost of enantiomerically pure (5)-3-hydroxy-y-butyrolactone at the process level and can influence related industry in a positive manner.<br>
In the prior-art, the synthesis of (S)-3-hydroxy-y-butyrolactone has been accomplished employing various synthetic strategies. A commonly used strategy for the synthesis of title<br>
compound-[l] and its intermediate (5)-3-hydroxybutyric acid derivatives is from the enzymatic or catalytic reduction of (3-keto ester (EP 452, 143A2, Tetrahedron Lett. 1990, 31, 267; J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1983,105, 5935).<br>
In another prior-art method, (5)-3-hydroxy-y-butyrolactone can be obtained from the selective reduction of (I)-malic acid ester (USP, 5,808,107, Chem. Lett. 1984, 1389).<br>
In yet another prior-art method, the tretment of a carbohydrate containing glucose substituent in the 4-position, such as cellobiose (p-l,4-linked glucose disaccharide), maltose (the a-1,4 linked isomer, amylose and cellulose with alkali has been shown to produce low yield of the desired material along with D, L-2, 4-dihydroxybutyric acid, glycolic acid isosaccharinic acid, ketones, diketones, glycolic acid and a plethora of other degradation and condensation products (Corbett etal. J. Chem. Soc. 1995, 1431; Green, J. W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1956, 78, 1894, Rowell, R. M. et al Carbohydrate Res. 1969, 11,17).<br>
In still another prior-art method, the (5)-3,4-dihydroxybutyric acid was obtained as a major product by alkaline degradation of carbohydrates to give the dicarbonyl compound and subsequent reaction with hydrogen peroxide (J. Chem. Soc. 1960, 1932).<br>
In another prior-art method, the (5)-3,4-dihydroxybutyric acid was obtained from lactose using base and oxidant. The acid obtained was cyclised to (5)-3-hydroxy-y-butyrolactone under the reaction condition and purified by protection of the two hydroxyl groups to acetonide ester compound, methyl (S)-3,4-O-isopropylidene-3, 4-dihydroxybutanoate which was recyclised to (5)-3-hydroxy-y-butyrolactone under acidic media (WO 98, 04543).<br>
In yet another prior-art method, a large number of methods have been developed to make (5)-3,4-dihydroxybutyric acid by alkaline oxidation of carbohydrate containing glucose substituent at the 4-position (USP 5,292,939, 5,319,110 &amp; 5,374,773 (1994). In these methods the dicarbonyl compounds formed is oxidized to f5)-3,4-dihydroxybutyric acid and glycolic acid.<br>
In still another prior-art (5)-3,4-dihydroxybutyric acid is prepared from carbohydrate either using base only or using oxygen in base. The yield reported of the desired compound is very low (30%) due the formation of large number of by-products (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1953, 2245, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1955, 1431, Carbohydrate Res. 1969, 11, 17, J. Chromatography 1991,549,113).<br>
In another prior-art method the target compound has been prepared by alkaline oxidative degradation of polysaccharides such as maltodextrin, starch and cellulose with (1,4) and /or (1,6) linked glucose units. The reaction leads to the complex mixture containing formic acid, oxalic acid, glycolic acid and erythronic acid (J. Am. Chem. Soc.1959, 81, 3136, Synthesis 1997, 597).<br>
In yet another prior-art method, the (S)-3,4-dihydroxybutyric acid derivatives has been prepared by oxidation of a-(l,4) linked oligosaccharides with a basic anion exchange resin with an oxidants to give (5)-3,4-dihydroxybutyric acid anion exchange resin complex dissociating the (5)-3,4-dihydroxybutyric acid from anion exchange resin complex.<br>
Chiral dihydroxybutyric acids and the corresponding esters, lactones and derivatives have proven to be valuable chemical entities. (5)-3-Hydroxy-y-butyrolactone (HGB) is an important building block to produce other chiral intermediates using classical chemistry methodology. Defunctionalisation of carbohydrate has been attracting much attention as a vibrant synthetic tool for the enantioselective synthesis of a wide variety of compounds. The synthesis of a chiral compound with desired number of chiral center could be achieved by eliminating the unneeded chiral centers quickly from carbohydrate precursors. A large number of a small-scale complex synthesis of (5)-3- hydroxy-y- butyrolactone have been reported demonstrating the value of this compound. Therefore, there is a genuine need for simple and inexpensive method for the large-scale preparation (S)-3- hydroxy-y-butyrolactone and its derivatives. In this project, it is proposed to synthesis (5)-3- hydroxy-y-butyrolactone by using inexpensive readily available carbohydrate material such as maltose, maltodextrin and lactose. A carbohydrate source is treated in a solvent with cumene hydroperoxide in the presence of a base, which leads to the formation of (S)-3,4 -dihydroxybutyric acid and glycolic acid. The subsequent acidification with an acid and removal of solvent affords the desired (5)-3-hydroxy-y- butyrolactone in optically active form. Thus employing the secondary chiral feedstock strategy, the readily available natural raw material could be used to manufacture (5)-3-hydroxy-y- butyrolactone (HGB) which act as a building block for a wide range of products. The new technology offers a practical and cost-effective route and would have advantage since it avoids use of expensive starting material to make the (S)-3- hydroxyl-y- butyrolactone.<br>
Some of the major drawback of the method known in the prior-art is such as<br>
1.	Expensive metal catalyst used for the reduction of prochiral center e.g. enzymatic or<br>
catalytic reduction of p-keto ester.<br>
2.	Selective reduction to only one of the two functional groups.<br>
3.	Low yields of (S)-3,4-dihydroxybutyric acid and (5)-3-hydroxy-y-butyrolactone<br>
4.	The over oxidation of (S)-3,4-dihydroxybutyric acid to formic acid and glycolic acid.<br>
5.	Many methods are not suitable as low yield of the desired product is obtained due to<br>
the formation of large number of side product such as glycolic acid, isosaccharinic<br>
acid, formic acid, ketone, diketone and glycolic acid.<br>
6.	The optical purity of the compound is low (poor enantioselectivity).<br>
7.	Purification of target compound is very difficult due to the formation of the complex<br>
mixture, containing formic acid, oxalic acid, glycolic acid and erythronic acid.<br>
8.	Multi-step synthesis.<br>
9.	Longer reaction time and high reaction temperature.<br>
10.	Overall low yield of the desired compound.<br>
In view of the above-mentioned drawbacks and disadvantages of the prior-art procedures, it is desirable to develop an efficient and enatioselective process for the synthesis of (-S)-hydroxy-y-butyrolactone, which overcomes the drawbacks of the prior-art process employing the oxidation of a D-hexose source under basic condition.(Table Removed) <br>
