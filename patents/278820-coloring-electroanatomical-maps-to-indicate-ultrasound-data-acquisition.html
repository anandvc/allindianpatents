				<td>COLORING ELECTROANATOMICAL MAPS TO INDICATE<br>
ULTRASOUND DATA ACQUISITION<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0001] This invention relates generally to mapping<br>
and reconstruction of body organs. More particularly, this<br>
invention relates to imaging internal body organs, such as<br>
the heart.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
[0002] Ultrasound imaging is now well established<br>
as a modality for imaging the heart. For example, U.S.<br>
Patent No. 6,066,096, whose disclosure is incorporated<br>
herein by reference, describes an imaging probe for<br>
volumetric intraluminal ultrasound imaging. The probe,<br>
configured to be placed inside a patient's body, includes<br>
an elongated body having proximal and distal ends. An<br>
ultrasonic transducer phased array is connected to and<br>
positioned on the distal end of the elongated body. The<br>
ultrasonic transducer phased array is positioned to emit<br>
and receive ultrasonic energy for volumetric forward<br>
scanning from the distal end of the elongated body. The<br>
ultrasonic transducer phased array includes a plurality of<br>
sites occupied by ultrasonic transducer elements.<br>
[0003] However, many physicians find it difficult<br>
to interpret ultrasound images, which typically appear as a<br>
two-dimensional fan-shaped pattern. Although the physician<br>
knows what anatomical features should appear in a display<br>
produced by an ultrasound catheter, he may not be able to<br>
match these features with the bright and dark areas of the<br>
fan.<br>
BI05143USNP<br>
 <br>
[0004] It has been proposed to improve medical<br>
image interpretation by superimposing images acquired by<br>
different modalities in registration. For example, U.S.<br>
Patent No. 6,556,695, issued to Packer et al., suggests<br>
that a magnetic resonance image can be acquired, and then<br>
registered with a subsequently acquired electrical<br>
activation map or ultrasound image.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0005] In order to assist the physician in<br>
performing a realtime cardiac imaging procedure, a three-<br>
dimensional image of the heart may be rendered during<br>
acquisition. However, this blocks the user's view of the<br>
heart chamber by other tissue reflection, e.g., from other<br>
chambers or organs. Therefore, it is difficult for the user<br>
to determine when adequate image data have been acquired or<br>
whether details are still missing.<br>
[0006] According to disclosed embodiments of the<br>
invention, a three-dimensional representation of the<br>
structure, such as a functional map, e.g., an<br>
electroanatomical map, is displayed and marked, typically<br>
by application of pseudocolor, during acquisition of<br>
ultrasound data in order to show the progress of data<br>
acquisition. For example, the planes of intersection of<br>
successive ultrasound two-dimensional fans that are<br>
acquired may be marked on an electroanatomical map as lines<br>
or colored regions on the map surface. This display enables<br>
the operator to determine regions where sufficient<br>
ultrasound data have been captured, and guides the operator<br>
to areas of the heart chamber where additional data<br>
2<br>
BI05143USNP<br>
 <br>
collection is still needed. Various color schemes are used<br>
to indicate the relative sufficiency of data collection.<br>
[0007] An embodiment of the invention provides a<br>
computer-assisted method for producing images of a living<br>
subject, which is carried out by displaying a three-<br>
dimensional model of a surface of a structure in a body of<br>
the subject, acquiring a sequence of two-dimensional<br>
anatomic images of at least a portion of the structure, and<br>
while acquiring the sequence, marking the three-dimensional<br>
model to show respective intersections of the image planes<br>
with the surface.<br>
[0008] In an aspect of the method, the three-<br>
dimensional model may be a computed tomographic image or a<br>
magnetic resonance image, which is automatically registered<br>
with the image planes.<br>
[0009] Another aspect of the method includes<br>
displaying the three-dimensional model and the respective<br>
intersections of the image planes with the surface on the<br>
three-dimensional model.<br>
[0010] According to an additional aspect of the<br>
method, a pseudocolor is displayed on the respective<br>
intersections of the image planes with the surface.<br>
[0011] Yet another aspect of the method includes<br>
interpolating areas of the three-dimensional model between<br>
the respective intersections, marking the interpolated<br>
areas, and displaying the interpolated areas.<br>
[0012] Another aspect of the method includes<br>
reconstructing a three-dimensional anatomic image of the<br>
3<br>
BI05143USNP<br>
 <br>
structure from the two-dimensional anatomic images, and<br>
displaying at least a portion of the three-dimensional<br>
anatomic image with the three-dimensional model.<br>
[0013] According to still another aspect of the<br>
method, the displayed portion of the three-dimensional<br>
anatomic image does not extend beyond a predefined distance<br>
from a surface of the three-dimensional model.<br>
[0014] According to one aspect of the method, the<br>
structure is a heart and the three-dimensional model is an<br>
anatomical map.<br>
[0015] In other aspects of the method, the two-<br>
dimensional anatomic images can be acquired by realtime<br>
three-dimensional ultrasound imaging, realtime computed<br>
tomographic imaging, or realtime magnetic resonance<br>
imaging.<br>
[0016] Other embodiments of the invention provide<br>
apparatus for carrying out the above-described method.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0025] In the following description, numerous<br>
specific details are set forth in order to provide a<br>
thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be<br>
apparent to one skilled in the art, however, that the<br>
present invention may be practiced without these specific<br>
details. In other instances, well-known circuits, control<br>
logic, and the details of computer program instructions for<br>
5<br>
BI05143USNP<br>
 <br>
conventional algorithms and processes have not been shown<br>
in detail in order not to obscure the present invention<br>
unnecessarily.<br>
System Overview<br>
[0026] Turning now to the drawings, reference is<br>
initially made to Fig. 1, which is an illustration of a<br>
system 20 for imaging and generating electrical activation<br>
maps of a heart 24 of a patient, and which is suitable for<br>
performing diagnostic or therapeutic procedures involving<br>
the heart 24, in accordance with an embodiment of the<br>
present invention.<br>
[0027] While the principles of the invention are<br>
disclosed with reference to cardiac imaging, the techniques<br>
described may be adapted for use for imaging other organs<br>
using a manually or automatically controlled probe,<br>
particularly hollow organs, such as the bladder, which may<br>
be imaged using an ultrasound catheter.<br>
[0028] The system 20 comprises a catheter 28, which<br>
is percutaneously inserted by a physician into a chamber or<br>
vascular structure of the heart. The catheter 28 typically<br>
comprises a handle 29 for operation of the catheter by the<br>
physician. Suitable controls on the handle 29 enable the<br>
physician to steer, position and orient the distal end of<br>
the catheter as desired.<br>
[0029] The system 20 enables the physician to<br>
perform a variety of mapping and imaging procedures. These<br>
procedures comprise, for example, the following techniques,<br>
which are described in further detail in copending,<br>
commonly assigned Application Nos. 11/115,002<br>
6<br>
BI05143USNP<br>
 <br>
and 11/7.62,217, the disclosures of which are herein<br>
incorporated by reference:<br>
[0030] display real-time or near real-<br>
time two-dimensional images, e.g. ultrasound<br>
images;<br>
[0031] reconstruct three-dimensional<br>
models of a target structure in the patient's<br>
body, based on two-dimensional ultrasound<br>
images;<br>
[0032] register, overlay and display a<br>
parametric map, such as an electro-<br>
physiological information map or an electro-<br>
anatomical map on the reconstructed three-<br>
dimensional model;<br>
[0033] register, overlay and display a<br>
three-dimensional image acquired from an<br>
external system on the reconstructed three-<br>
dimensional model; and<br>
[0034] register and display two-<br>
dimensional ultrasound images on a three-<br>
dimensional image acquired from an external<br>
system.<br>
[0035] The system 20 comprises a positioning<br>
subsystem that measures three-dimensional location<br>
information and orientation coordinates of the catheter 28<br>
with up to six degrees of freedom. The positioning<br>
subsystem may comprise a magnetic position tracking system<br>
that determines the position and orientation of the<br>
catheter 28. The positioning subsystem generates magnetic<br>
fields in a predefined working volume its vicinity and<br>
senses these fields at the catheter. The positioning<br>
subsystem typically comprises a set of external radiators,<br>
7<br>
BI05143USNP<br>
 <br>
such as field generating coils 30, which are located in<br>
fixed, known positions external to the patient. The<br>
coils 30 generate fields, typically electromagnetic fields,<br>
in the vicinity of the heart 24.<br>
[0036] In an alternative embodiment, a radiator in<br>
the catheter, such as a coil, generates electromagnetic<br>
fields, which are received by sensors (not shown) outside<br>
the patient's body.<br>
[0037] The position sensor transmits, in response<br>
to the sensed fields, position-related electrical signals<br>
over cables 33 running through the catheter to a<br>
console 34. Alternatively, the position sensor may transmit<br>
signals to the console 34 over a wireless link. The<br>
console 34 comprises a positioning processor 36 that<br>
calculates the location and orientation of the catheter 28<br>
based on the signals sent by a location sensor 46. The<br>
positioning processor 36 typically receives, amplifies,<br>
filters, digitizes, and otherwise processes signals from<br>
the catheter 28. Images produced by the system 20 are<br>
displayed on a monitor 44.<br>
[0038] Some position tracking systems that may be<br>
used for this purpose are described, for example, in U.S.<br>
Patents 6,690,963, 6,618,612 and 6,332,089, and U.S. Patent<br>
Application Publications 2004/0147920, and 2004/0068178,<br>
whose disclosures are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Although the positioning subsystem shown in Fig. 1 uses<br>
magnetic fields, the methods described below may be<br>
implemented using any other suitable positioning subsystem,<br>
such as systems based on acoustic or ultrasonic<br>
measurements.<br>
8<br>
BI05143USNP<br>
 <br>
[0039] For ultrasound image generation, the<br>
system 20 may employ the catheters disclosed in U.S. Patent<br>
Nos. 6,716,166 and 6,773,402, whose disclosures are herein<br>
incorporated by reference, in order to acquire ultrasound<br>
images for display in near realtime ultrasound images<br>
concurrently with an image or representation of the<br>
position of a deployment catheter in the same or different<br>
sessions, and in many different combinations. Such<br>
catheters have acoustic transducers that are adapted for<br>
emitting sound waves, and receiving reflections from<br>
echogenic interfaces in the heart. The reflections are then<br>
analyzed to construct two-dimensional and three-dimensional<br>
images of the heart.<br>
[0040] The system 20 comprises an ultrasound<br>
driver 39 that drives the ultrasound transducers of the<br>
catheter 28 when it functions as an ultrasound imaging<br>
catheter. One example of a suitable ultrasound driver that<br>
can be used for this purpose is an AN2300™ ultrasound<br>
system produced by Analogic Corporation, 8 Centennial<br>
Drive, Peabody, MA 01960. The ultrasound driver 39 may<br>
support different imaging modes such as B-mode, M-mode, CW<br>
Doppler and color flow Doppler, as are known in the art.<br>
[0041] Optionally, the catheter 28 and another<br>
catheter 48 are both incorporated in the system 20 and<br>
inserted concurrently into the heart via different vascular<br>
approaches. In this example, the catheter 28 functions as a<br>
mapping catheter, and the catheter 48 functions as an<br>
ultrasound imaging catheter, using an array of acoustic<br>
transducers 50. Each has an instance of the location<br>
sensor 46 that is used to determine the position and<br>
orientation of the catheter within the body.<br>
9<br>
BI05143USNP<br>
 <br>
[0042] The system 20 contains electronic circuitry<br>
for generation of an electrical activation map, and can be<br>
used in conjunction with many specialized mapping<br>
catheters. A suitable mapping catheter for use as the<br>
catheter 28 is described in commonly assigned U.S. Patent<br>
No. 6,892,091, whose disclosure is herein incorporated by<br>
reference. Briefly, the distal end of the mapping catheter<br>
includes a distally placed mapping electrode 52 for<br>
measuring the electrical properties of the heart tissue.<br>
The distal end of the mapping catheter further also<br>
includes an array of non-contact electrodes 54 for<br>
measuring far field electrical signals in the heart<br>
chamber.<br>
[0043] Typically, the mapping catheter is<br>
introduced first, and an electrical activation map<br>
generated from its data. Afterward, an ultrasound imaging<br>
catheter is introduced. The two catheters may be introduced<br>
via the same or different vascular approaches.<br>
[0044] In yet another alternative, a hybrid<br>
catheter, capable of both data acquisition suitable for<br>
electrical activation map generation, and also having<br>
ultrasound imaging functions can be used. Such catheters<br>
are described, for example, in U.S. Patents Nos. 6,773,402,<br>
6,788,967, and 6,645,145. Use of such catheters may permit<br>
the medical procedure to be shortened. In this alternative,<br>
only one catheter need be inserted. In all the<br>
alternatives, as explained in further detail below, the<br>
electrical activation map is usually acquired first, and<br>
then applied to the ultrasound images to assist in the<br>
interpretation of the latter. Suitable image registration<br>
techniques for coordinating the two modalities are<br>
disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,650,927 and in co-pending<br>
10<br>
BI05143USNP<br>
 <br>
Application No. 11/215,435, both of common assignee<br>
herewith, and herein incorporated by reference.<br>
[0045] Reference is now made to Fig. 2, which is a<br>
block diagram illustrating further details of the system 20<br>
(Fig. 1). As noted above, many elements of the system 20<br>
can be realized as a general purpose or specialized<br>
computer that includes a processor and a memory that<br>
contains objects corresponding to the functional blocks<br>
depicted in Fig. 2. The positioning processor 36 is linked<br>
to location sensors that are placed near the distal tip of<br>
the cardiac catheter and performs location tracking.<br>
[0046]	The ultrasound driver 39, which drives the<br>
transducers 50	(Fig. 1) is cooperative with ultrasound<br>
circuitry 56,	and produces two-dimensional ultrasound<br>
images.<br>
[0047] An image processor 60 is linked to the<br>
mapping circuitry 58, the positioning processor 36, and the<br>
ultrasound circuitry 56. The image processor 60 can perform<br>
three-dimensional ultrasound image reconstruction, and is<br>
specialized for the automatic identification of cardiac<br>
topological features on the ultrasound images. In some<br>
embodiments, the image processor 60 may augment automatic<br>
identification of topologic features on the electrical<br>
activation map by the mapping circuitry 58, without<br>
operator assistance. The image processor 60 also performs<br>
image registration functions. Its operation is mediated via<br>
a user input 62. Its output is sent to a display 64.<br>
[0048] A commercial unit suitable for use in the<br>
system 20, which is capable of generating an electrical<br>
activation map, is the CARTO XP EP Navigation and Ablation<br>
11<br>
BI05143USNP<br>
 <br>
System, available from Biosense Webster, Inc., 3333 Diamond<br>
Canyon Road, Diamond Bar, CA 917 65. Images acquired using<br>
different modalities can be registered for display using<br>
the CartoMerge™ image integration module, which is adapted<br>
for operation with the CARTO XP EP Navigation and Ablation<br>
System. In particular, it is possible to register a three-<br>
dimensional anatomical map or electroanatomical map with a<br>
three-dimensional ultrasound image with this module.<br>
Furthermore, the ultrasound fan image produced by two-<br>
dimensional ultrasound imaging shares the coordinate system<br>
of the anatomical or electroanatomical map. The system is<br>
able to automatically compute the intersection of the fan<br>
image and the three-dimensional image, as well as<br>
interpolate between adjacent intersections of different fan<br>
images.<br>
Operation<br>
[0049] Reference is now made to Fig. 3, which is a<br>
flow chart of a general method of marking a three-<br>
dimensional model of an internal structure of the body to<br>
indicate progress in acquiring a plurality of two-<br>
dimensional images of the structure in accordance with a<br>
disclosed embodiment of the invention.<br>
[0050] At initial step 80, a three-dimensional<br>
model of the structure is acquired and displayed. This can<br>
be an image of the heart, obtained with a system such as<br>
the above-noted CARTO XP EP Navigation and Ablation System.<br>
However any three-dimensional model can be used, for<br>
example a tomographic image. It is important to display the<br>
topography of the heart or other structure, and the<br>
functional data, for example electrical potentials that may<br>
be shown on the model are incidental.<br>
12<br>
BI05143USNP<br>
 <br>
[0051] Next, at step 82 a two-dimensional image of<br>
a portion of the structure is acquired. This may be an<br>
ultrasound image. Alternatively, the two-dimensional image<br>
could be a two-dimensional functional image, obtained by<br>
techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging or computed<br>
tomographic imaging.<br>
[0052] Next, at step 84, the two-dimensional image<br>
acquired in step 82 is automatically registered or<br>
otherwise coordinated with the three-dimensional model<br>
produced in initial step 80. This step allows topographic<br>
features of the three-dimensional model to be related to<br>
the structures imaged in step 82.<br>
[0053] Next, at step 86, the intersection of the<br>
plane of the two-dimensional image with the three-<br>
dimensional model is marked on the display. This step can<br>
be performed by applying a pseudocolor to the display.<br>
Alternatively, many other graphical techniques can be used<br>
to indicate the intersection, e.g., flashing effects,<br>
holding emphasis. Additionally, as explained below,<br>
pseudocolor may be applied in order to display areas on the<br>
three-dimensional model located between adjacent<br>
intersections of different fan images. Such areas are<br>
identified by interpolation. In any case, the operator can<br>
identify topographical features of the structure that were<br>
obtained on the current two-dimensional image by reference<br>
to the display and the markings on the three-dimensional<br>
model. Optionally, the operator may annotate the display by<br>
textual descriptive information relating to the current<br>
two-dimensional image.<br>
13<br>
BIOS143USNP<br>
 <br>
[0054] Control now proceeds to decision step 88,<br>
where it is determined if more images are required to<br>
complete the imaging study. If the determination at<br>
decision step 88 is affirmative, then control returns to<br>
step 82 for another iteration.<br>
[0055] If the determination at decision step 88 is<br>
negative, then control proceeds to final step 90, and the<br>
procedure ends.<br>
Alternate Embodiment 1<br>
[0056] Reference is now made to Fig. 4, which is a<br>
detailed flow chart of a method of coloring an<br>
electroanatomical map or other functional map to indicate<br>
ultrasound data acquisition in accordance with an alternate<br>
embodiment of the invention. It will be understood that<br>
"coloring", also referred to herein as the application of<br>
pseudocolor, denotes a computing task and involves<br>
modifications to memory in which image data is stored. The<br>
results of the operation may be visualized on a computer<br>
monitor as a colored display. The method is discussed with<br>
reference to an electroanatomical map by way of example.<br>
However, the method is applicable to other functional<br>
images of the heart, so long as the topology of the heart<br>
is shown and can be related to the location of the<br>
ultrasound data. In initial step 66, using instrumentation<br>
described above with reference to Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, a<br>
mapping catheter is introduced into a subject using well-<br>
known techniques. An ultrasound imaging catheter is also<br>
introduced into the heart.<br>
[0057] Next, at step 68, the mapping catheter is<br>
navigated within the heart, and electrical data obtained. A<br>
14<br>
BI05143USNP<br>
 <br>
functional image is generated. In one embodiment, an<br>
electroanatomical map is generated, for example, using the<br>
above-mentioned CARTO XP EP Navigation and Ablation System.<br>
The image is generated using the mapping catheter by<br>
determining spatial coordinates of different locations in<br>
the heart to define a three-dimensional space. Then a<br>
functional model is prepared, which is a three-dimensional<br>
map of the heart in the three-dimensional space, in which<br>
the map displays functional information, i.e., electrical<br>
potentials at multiple points of the heart.<br>
[0058] Concurrently with step 68, at step 70, at<br>
least one two-dimensional ultrasound image is acquired.<br>
Generally, this is a gated image. Position information<br>
provided by location sensors on the ultrasound imaging<br>
catheter are processed by the positioning subsystem to<br>
establish coordinates of different points on the ultrasound<br>
image. Typically, the electroanatomical map and the two-<br>
dimensional ultrasound image are obtained during the same<br>
session. However, this is not necessary, and alternatively,<br>
the electroanatomical map may be pre-acquired and<br>
registered with the two-dimensional ultrasound image.<br>
[0059] Next, at step 69, the area of the<br>
electroanatomical map or other functional image<br>
corresponding to the ultrasound image acquired in the last<br>
iteration of step 70 is identified by application of<br>
pseudocolor. One pseudocolor may be used, at different<br>
intensities as the sufficiency of the image improves.<br>
Alternatively, multiple pseudocolors can be used and<br>
combined in order to indicate current image quality in many<br>
different schemes. Additionally or alternatively, other<br>
graphical indications of image quality may be displayed in<br>
this step, for example flashing effects. In one embodiment,<br>
15<br>
BI05143USNP<br>
 <br>
the relevant portion of the electroanatomical map is<br>
determined by computing the plane of intersection of the<br>
ultrasound fan image on the electroanatomical map.<br>
[0060] Reference is now made to Fig. 5, which is a<br>
display of multimodal images of the heart in accordance<br>
with a disclosed embodiment of the invention. An image 92,<br>
at the left side of Fig. 5, is a topological map of a heart<br>
chamber generated by the above-noted CARTO XP EP Navigation<br>
and Ablation System.<br>
[0061] In a central image 94, the map is partly<br>
colored to show an area 96 of the chamber wall where<br>
ultrasound data have been collected. For example, the plane<br>
of intersection of each successive ultrasound two-<br>
dimensional fan that is acquired may be marked on the<br>
image 94 as a colored region on the map surface.<br>
Alternatively, the plane of intersection may be marked as a<br>
colored line. Further alternatively, the image 94 may be<br>
colored to mark every data voxel where the ultrasound beam<br>
plane intersected the electroanatomical map. In any case,<br>
the display enables the operator to see where sufficient<br>
ultrasound data have been captured and is useful to guide<br>
the operator to areas of the heart chamber where additional<br>
data collection is still needed.<br>
[0062] An image 98 on the right of Fig. 5 shows a<br>
reconstruction of a three-dimensional ultrasound image 100<br>
superimposed on the image 98, which is here referenced as<br>
an area 102. The image 98 and the area 102 are based on the<br>
collected ultrasound data.<br>
[0063] In one embodiment, two-dimensional<br>
ultrasound images are projected without reconstructing a<br>
16<br>
BI05143USNP<br>
 <br>
solid three-dimensional model. This technique is described<br>
in the above-noted Application Nos. 11/115,002<br>
and 11/262,217. For example, successive two-dimensional<br>
ultrasound images can be acquired in iterations of step 70<br>
(Fig. 4), and contours-of-interest tagged. The images can<br>
then be oriented and projected in three-dimensional space.<br>
[0064] Reference is now made to Fig. 6, which shows<br>
a skeleton model 88 of the right ventricle of a heart, in<br>
accordance with a disclosed embodiment of the invention.<br>
The system 20 (Fig. 1) can automatically trace and<br>
reconstruct contours 90, 92 from untagged ultrasound images<br>
and can automatically reconstruct contours 94 from two-<br>
dimensional physician-labeled counterparts.<br>
[0065] Reference is now made to Fig. 7, which is an<br>
exemplary composite image 96 in which a skeleton model of a<br>
three-dimensional ultrasound image 98 of the heart is<br>
superimposed on an electro-anatomical map 100 of the right<br>
ventricle, in accordance with a disclosed embodiment of the<br>
invention. The skeleton model is similar to the skeleton<br>
model 88 (Fig. 6), having a plurality of contours 102, 104<br>
outlining the right ventricle and left ventricle,<br>
respectively. The contours 102 are overlaid on the<br>
electroanatomical map. Different electrical potential<br>
values are indicated by different shading patterns.<br>
Superimposing the skeletal model on the electroanatomical<br>
map in step 72 (Fig. 4) results in less interference on the<br>
display than using a fully reproduced three-dimensional<br>
model, as can be appreciated by a comparison of Fig. 7 with<br>
the image 98 (Fig. 5). As in Fig. 5, portions of the<br>
map 100 may be automatically marked using pseudocolor to<br>
indicate adequate ultrasound data collection. For example,<br>
17<br>
BI05143USNP<br>
 <br>
pseudocolor has been applied to an area 105, represented by<br>
a diagonally hatched pattern in Fig. 7.<br>
[0066] Referring again to Fig. 4, as the data are<br>
acquired in successive iterations of step 70, the<br>
electroanatomical map, and optionally vessels, which may be<br>
shown diagrammatically on the electroanatomical map as<br>
contours or cylindrical structures, are progressively<br>
colored to indicate the areas that were imaged, as shown on<br>
the image 94 (Fig. 5) . For example, the map may start with<br>
a gray color, as on the image 92 (Fig. 5), and the color<br>
may then change from gray to red at every point on the map<br>
that corresponds to points where ultrasound image data were<br>
acquired. In this manner, the operator receives a clear<br>
indication of the current data coverage.<br>
[0067] Next, at step 72, the ultrasound images<br>
acquired in iterations of step 70 are superimposed on the<br>
electroanatomical map, such that the two are seen in<br>
registration on a display. This is carried out<br>
automatically, using methods of synchronization, and<br>
registration of the reconstructed image with the<br>
electroanatomical map, as noted above. Briefly, the<br>
ultrasound catheter includes both a location sensor and an<br>
ultrasound transducer in one unit. The system, after<br>
appropriate calibration, can automatically correlate any<br>
point seen on the ultrasound image with its corresponding<br>
point in three-dimensional space of the electroanatomic<br>
map. The image registration is typically established by<br>
correlating the coordinates during the generation of the<br>
electroanatomic map with position information and<br>
coordinates on the ultrasound image that were obtained in<br>
step 70. External anatomic markers may be used to provide a<br>
common frame of reference in order to couple the data from<br>
18<br>
BI05143USNP<br>
 <br>
the two modalities. In some embodiments, the ultrasound<br>
image is a three-dimensional ultrasound image that is<br>
reconstructed from multiple two-dimensional ultrasound<br>
images. Alternatively, two-dimensional fan images are<br>
superimposed as lines on the electroanatomical map.<br>
[0068] Optionally, as shown in step 75, the<br>
ultrasound images and the electroanatomical map are<br>
displayed separately. This option has the advantages that<br>
multimodal image registration issues are avoided in the<br>
display. Furthermore, one image is not obscured by the<br>
other. In a variation of step 75, at least a portion of the<br>
three-dimensional image is displayed inside the three-<br>
dimensional model, and the three-dimensional image does not<br>
extend more than a predefined distance from the surface of<br>
the three-dimensional model. The result is that a three-<br>
dimensional space is segmented according to the proportion<br>
of the three-dimensional image that is displayed.<br>
Segmentation techniques suitable for this operation are<br>
disclosed in the above-noted Application No. 11/215,435.<br>
[0069] In either of steps 72, 75 synchronization<br>
between the two modalities required, of course. Referring<br>
again to Fig. 7, the ultrasound image 98 and the electro-<br>
anatomical map 100 can be acquired using different<br>
equipment. When one or both of the images are being tracked<br>
in near-real time, and particularly when different<br>
equipment is used for the two modalities, propagation<br>
delays between the source equipment and the processor 36<br>
(Fig. 1) necessitate careful attention to synchronization<br>
of the two components of the composite image 96. Indeed,<br>
synchronization issues occur generally, in different<br>
embodiments of the system 20 (Fig. 1). Solutions for this<br>
problem are taught in the above-noted Application<br>
19<br>
BI05143USNP<br>
 <br>
No. 11/262,217. Briefly, when near real-time electro-<br>
anatomical data are acquired and superimposed upon<br>
previously acquired anatomic images or models, a constant<br>
pre-defined offset, which can be a temporal offset, is<br>
establi shed between the electroanatomical data and the<br>
anatomic image gating. This offset compensates for system<br>
delays caused by image processing and image transfer from<br>
the source of the anatomic images to the image processor,<br>
which as noted above, generates an electroanatomical map<br>
from the electroanatomical data.<br>
[0070] After performing either of steps 72, 75, the<br>
operator may identify anatomical features and mark them on<br>
the display, using a graphical user interface.<br>
[0071] Control next proceeds to decision step 79,<br>
where it is determined if more two-dimensional ultrasound<br>
images are necessary to complete the examination. This<br>
decision is normally made by the operator, but he may be<br>
prompted by the system, which can automatically determine<br>
if the examination is complete. If the determination at<br>
decision step 79 is affirmative, then control returns to<br>
step 70. When imaging the heart, the operator may start the<br>
imaging procedure with contour mapping of the left and<br>
right atria, marking relevant structures, such as the<br>
pulmonary veins, aorta and fossa ovalis. The pulmonary<br>
veins and aorta can be shown as vessels with adjustable<br>
radii defined by the ultrasound contours.<br>
[0072] If the determination at decision step 79 is<br>
negati.ve, then control proceeds to final step 81. The<br>
catheters are withdrawn, and the procedure ends.<br>
20<br>
 <br>
Alternate Embodiment 2<br>
[0073] This embodiment is similar to alternate<br>
embodiment 1, except that an inverse display mode can be<br>
used for displaying a three-dimensional image, e.g., the<br>
image 100 (Fig. 5) in steps 72, 75 (Fig. 4). The data<br>
acquisition for the ultrasound images is essentially the<br>
same, but instead of showing high gray scale levels for<br>
tissue, the three-dimensional ultrasound image indicates<br>
the blood in the chamber or vessel, and is an indicator of<br>
the chamber or vessel blood volume.<br>
Alternate Embodiment 3<br>
[0074] Other physiological data that may be mapped<br>
for co-display in steps 72, 75 (Fig. 4) with ultrasound<br>
images and pseudocolor applied colored to indicate<br>
sufficiency of ultrasound data collection as described<br>
above. Volumetric intraluminal ultrasound imaging as<br>
described by the above-noted U.S. Patent No. 6,066,096 can<br>
be used. Other physiological parameters that can be mapped<br>
include temperature, blood flow rate, chemical properties<br>
and mechanical activity, e.g., regional wall motion. For<br>
example, areas of high-speed flow detected by an ultrasound<br>
catheters, as disclosed, e.g., in the above-noted U.S.<br>
Patent Nos. 6,716,166 and 6,773,402, may be identified in a<br>
Doppler image and registered with stenoses in blood vessels<br>
observed in a three-dimensional ultrasound image. As<br>
another example, a chemical sensor may be used to identify<br>
areas of the heart with low NADPH levels, indicative of<br>
ischemia. Such areas may be registered with corresponding<br>
areas observed on ultrasound images. The technique<br>
described in the article Quantitative Measurements of<br>
Cardiac Phosphorus Metabolites in Coronary Artery Disease<br>
by 31P Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Takahiro Yabe et<br>
21<br>
BI05143USNP<br>
 <br>
al., Circulation. 1995;92:15-23 is suitable for displaying<br>
such areas.<br>
Alternate Embodiment 4<br>
[0075] In this embodiment, step 70 (Fig. 4) is<br>
performed using a modality other than two-dimensional<br>
ultrasound imaging to acquire realtime data as a series of<br>
image "slices" through the target structure. Step 70 can be<br>
performed using a realtime three-dimensional ultrasound<br>
imaging probe, realtime computed tomographic imaging,<br>
realtime magnetic resonance imaging or other realtime<br>
imaging modality from which three-dimensional images can be<br>
generated and co-displayed with a functional image to which<br>
pseudocolor is applied to indicate sufficiency of data<br>
imaging in particular areas.<br>
Alternate Embodiment 5<br>
[0076] This variation can be employed additionally<br>
to any of the preceding embodiments. In steps 72, 75<br>
(Fig. 4), additional indications are shown on the map<br>
display to guide the operator during data acquisition. For<br>
example, the fill ratio, the ratio of colored area to total<br>
target area on the electroanatomical map or other<br>
functional map, can be displayed to quantitatively indicate<br>
the extent of completion of the session.<br>
[0077] In additional application of pseudocolor<br>
itself can be modified according to the gray scale level of<br>
each voxel using a corresponding lookup table. This enables<br>
the user to see if the acquired data corresponds to a wall<br>
tissue or to a vessel or valve opening in the chamber.<br>
