				<td>PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS COMPRISING A CAMPTOTHECIN DERIVATE<br>
The present invention relates to novel pharmaceutical compositions in which the active agent is a topoisomerase I inhibitor, in particular a camptothecin derivative, that is useful for the treatment and prevention of proliferative diseases including cancer.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Camptothecin derivatives are a class of compounds described in U.S. Patent No 6,242,457, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. Camptothecin derivatives, such as those disclosed in U.S. Patent No 6,242,457, present highly specific difficulties in relation to administration generally and galenic compositions in particular, including in particular problems of drug bioavailability because these derivatives have very poor solubility.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
In accordance with the present invention it has now surprisingly been found that stable pharmaceutical compositions with camptothecin derivatives, including but not limited to 7-t- • butoxyiminomethylcamptothecin, have particularly interesting bioavailability characteristics. These novel compositions have been found to meet or substantially reduce the difficulties encountered previously. It has been shown that the compositions of the invention may enable effective dosaging with concomitant enhancement of bioavailability as well as reduced variability of absorption/bioavailability levels for and between individual patients. Thus, the invention may achieve effective therapy with tolerable dosage levels of such camptothecin derivatives, and may permit closer standardization and optimization of daily dosage requirements for each individual. Consequently, occurrence of potential undesirable side-effects is diminished and overall cost of therapy may be reduced.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
In a first aspect the present invention provides a spontaneously dispersible pharmaceutical composition comprising a camptothecin derivative.<br><br>
The spontaneously dispersible pharmaceutical composition is hereinafter also referred to as a "composition of the invention". It is preferably a microemulsion preconcentrate.<br>
Terms used in the specification have the following meanings:<br>
"Active agent" as used herein means a camptothecin derivative, such as those disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,242,457.<br>
"Poorly water soluble" as used herein means having a solubility in water at 20°C of less than 1 %, for example 0.01 % weight/volume, i.e. a "sparingly soluble to very slightly soluble drug" as described in Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 19lh Edition, Ed. A.R. Gennaro, Mack Publishing Company, US, 1995, vol. 1, p 195.<br>
"Bioavailable" as used herein with reference to a composition means the composition provides a maximum concentration of the active agent in that composition in a use environment that is at least 1.5 fold that of a control comprising an equivalent quantity of the undispersed drug.<br>
"Spontaneously dispersible pharmaceutical composition" as used herein means a composition that contains an active agent herein defined and is capable of producing colloidal structures-when diluted with an aqueous medium, for example water, or in gastric juices. The colloidal structures are preferably liquid droplets in the microemulsion size range. Solid drug particles, either crystalline or amorphous, of mean diameter greater than 200 nm may also be present. The spontaneously dispersible pharmaceutical composition is preferably a microemulsion preconcentrate.<br>
"Microemulsion preconcentrate" as used herein means a composition which spontaneously forms a microemulsion in an aqueous medium, for example, in water, for example on dilution of 1:1 to 1:300, preferably 1:1 to 1:70, but especially 1:1 to 1:10 or in the gastric juices after oral application.<br>
"Microemulsion" as used herein means a translucent, slightly opaque, opalescent, non-opaque or substantially non-opaque colloidal dispersion that is formed spontaneously or substantially spontaneously when its components are brought into contact with an aqueous<br><br>
medium. A microemulsion is thermodynamically stable and typically contains dispersed droplets of a mean diameter less than about 200 nm (2000 A). Generally microemulsions comprise droplets or liquid nanoparticles that have a mean diameter of less than about 150 nm (1500 A); typically less than 100 nm, generally greater than 10 nm, and they are stable over periods up to 24 hours or longer.<br>
Microemulsions offer greater ease of preparation due to spontaneous formation, thermodynamic stability, transparent and elegant appearance, increased drug loading, enhanced penetration through the biological membranes, increased bioavailability, and less inter- and intra-individual variability in drug pharmacokinetics than coarse emulsions. Further characteristics of microemulsions can be found in United Kingdom patent specification GB 2,222,770; Rosof, Progress in Surface and Membrane Science, 12,405 et seq. Academic Press (1975); Friberg, Dispersion Science and Technology, 6 (3), 317 et seq. (1985); and Muller et al. Pharm. Ind., 50 (3), 370 et seq. (1988)].<br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides a spontaneously dispersible pharmaceutical composition comprising a camptothecin derivative, and a carrier medium comprising a lipophilic component, a surfactant, a hydrophilic component and optionally a co-solvent.<br>
Preferably the spontaneously dispersible pharmaceutical composition is suitable for oral administration.<br>
The camptothecin derivatives, have poor water solubility characteristics and display a water solubility of below 0.001 %, e.g. 0.001 to 0.0001 %.<br>
The active agent is preferably used in free base form.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides a microemulsion preconcentrate comprising a camptothecin derivative. Especially interesting is that the drug load achieved within the microemulsion pre-concentrates is significantly higher than within the single excipients indicating an over-additive solubility of the camptothecin derivatives within the microemulsion preconcent rates.<br><br>
In a fourth aspect, the present invention provides a microemulsion preconcentrate comprising a camptothecin derivative and a carrier medium that comprises a lipophilic component, a surfactant, a hydrophilic component and a optionally co-solvent.<br>
The microemulsion preconcentrate preferably forms an o/w (oil-in-water) microemulsion when diluted with water.<br>
Preferably the relative proportions of the lipophilic component(s), the surfactant(s), the hydrophilic component(s), and optionally the co-solvent(s) lie within the "Microemulsion" region on a standard three way plot graph. These phase diagrams, can be generated in a conventional manner as described in e.g. GB 2,222,770 or WO 96/13273.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides a microemulsion comprising a camptothecin derivative.<br>
The microemulsion is preferably an o/w (oil-in-water) microemulsion.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides a microemulsion comprising a camptothecin derivatives, a lipophilic component, a surfactant, water, a hydrophilic component and optionally a co-solvent<br>
The colloidal structures of the microemulsion form spontaneously or substantially spontaneously when the components of the composition of the invention are brought into contact with an aqueous medium, e.g. by simple shaking by hand for a short period of time, for example for 10 seconds. The compositions of the invention are thermodynamically stable, e.g. for at least 15 minutes or up to 4 hours, even to 24 hours or longer. Typically, they contain dispersed structures, i.e. droplets or liquid nanoparticles of a mean diameter less than about 200 nm (2,000 A), e.g. less than about 150 nm (1,500 A), typically less than 100 nm (1,000 A), generally greater than 10 nm (100 A) as measured by standard light scattering techniques, e.g. using a MALVERN ZETASIZER 3000™ particle characterising machine. Solid drug particles of mean diameter greater than 200 nm may also be present. The proportion of particles present may be temperature dependent.<br><br>
The active agent is an inhibitor of topoisomerase I (Topo I inhibitor) and is therefore capable of preventing disease symptoms that are caused inter alia by the activation of the topoisomerase I receptor.<br>
More specifically the active agent is a camptothecin derivative. This class of compounds is described in U.S. Patent No. 6,242,457.<br>

The surfactant may comprise 5 to 90 % by weight of the composition of the invention; preferably 10 to 85 % by weight, more preferably 15 to 60 % by weight.<br>
The compositions of the present invention may contain co-solvents to reduce the interfacial tension thereby providing thermodynamic stability. Suitable co-solvents include lower alkanols such as ethanol. While tho use of ethanol in the compositions is not essential, it has been found to be of particular advantage to increase the solubility of camptothecin derivative. This is because storage characteristics are improved, in particular the risk of active agent precipitation following encapsulation procedures is reduced. Thus the shelf life stability may be extended by employing ethanoi or some other such co-component as an additional ingredient of the composition. The ethanol may comprise 0 to 60 % by weight of the composition; preferably 5 to about 30% by weight and more preferably about 5 to 20 % by weight.<br>

Preferred antioxidants Include ascorbyl palmitate, butyl hydroxy anisoie (BHA), butyl hydroxy toluene (BHT) and citric acid. The antioxidant ascorbyl palmitate is especially preferred.<br>
These additives or ingredients may comprise about 0.05 to 5% by weight of the total weight of the composition. Antioxidants, antimicrobial agents, enzyme inhibitors, stabilizers or preservatives typically provide up to about 0.05 to 1% by weight based on the total weight of the composition. Sweetening or flavouring agents typically provide up to about 2.5 or 5% by weight based on the total weight of the composition.<br>
In another aspect, the invention provides a process for preparing a spontaneously dispersible pharmaceutical composition containing a camptothecin derivative as an active<br>
agent, which process comprises bringing the active agent and a carrier medium comprising (1) a lipophilic component, (2) a surfactant, (3) a hydrophilic component, and optionally (4) a co-solvent into intimate admixture.<br>
The carrier medium can be prepared separately before bringing the active agent into intimate admixture with the carrier medium. Alternatively the two or more of the components of the carrier medium can be mixed together with the active agent.<br>
The spontaneously dispersible pharmaceutical composition is preferably a microemulsion preconcentrate as herein defined.<br>
The spontaneously dispersible pharmaceutical composition preferably spontaneously or substantially spontaneously forms an o/w (oil-in-water) emulsion, e.g. microemulsion, when diluted with an aqueous medium such as water to a dilution of 1:1 to 1:300, e.g. 1:1 to 1:70, especially 1:10 to 1:70, more especially e.g. 1:10, or in the gastric juices of a patient after oral application.<br>
In another aspect, the invention provides a process for the preparing a microemulsion containing a camptothecin derivative as an active agent, which process comprises: (i)       bringing the active agent and a carrier comprising (1) a lipophilic component, (2) a surfactant, (3) a hydrophilic component, and optionally (4) a co-solvent Into intimate admixture to form a spontaneously dispersible pharmaceutical composition; and (ii)      diluting the spontaneously dispersible pharmaceutical composition in an aqueous medium to form the microemulsion.<br>
As mentioned above, the active agent may be present in an amount by weight of up to about 20% by weight of the composition of the invention, e.g. from about 0.05% by weight. The active agent is preferably present in an amount of about 0.5 to about 15 % by weight of the composition, more preferably in an amount of about 1.0 to about 5% by weight of the composition.<br>
The lipophilic component preferably comprises about 5 to about 85 % by weight of the composition of the invention, e.g. about 10 to about 85%; preferably about 15 to about 60 % by weight.<br>
The hydrophilic component may comprise about 5 to about 60 % by weight of the composition of the invention, e.g. about 5 to about 50%; preferably about 5 to about 40 % by weight, more preferably about 5 to about 30% by weight. It may comprise a mixture of two or more hydrophilic components.<br>
The surfactant may comprise about 5 to about 90% by weight of the composition of the invention; preferably about 15 to about 85% by weight, more preferably about 20 to about 60 : % by weight.<br>
The co-solvent may comprise about 0 to about 90% by weight of the composition of the invention, preferably about 0 to about 30% by weight, more preferably about 0 to about 20% by weight, e.g. about 15 or 20% by weight.<br>
The relative proportion of the active agent(s), the lipophilic component(s), the surfactant(s) the hydrophilic component(s), and the co-solvents (when present) preferably lie within the "Microemulsion" region on a standard three way plot graph. The compositions will therefore be of high stability that are capable, on addition to an aqueous medium, of providing microemulsions, for example having a mean particle size of 
When the composition of the invention is a microemulsion preconcentrate a unit dosage of the microemulsion preconcentrate is preferably used to fill orally administrate capsule shells. The capsule shells may be soft or hard capsule shells, for example made of gelatine. Each unit dosage will suitably contain from 0.1 to 100 mg active agent, for example 0.1 mg, 0.25mg, O.Smg, 1 mg, 2 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, 25 mg or 50 mg, preferably between 0.1 and 1 mg of the active agent. Such unit dosage forms are suitable for administration 1 to 5 times daily depending upon the particular purpose of therapy, the phase of therapy and the like. However, if desired, the compositions may be in drink solution form and may include water or any other aqueous system, e.g. fruit juice, milk, and the like, to provide e.g. colloidal systems, suitable for drinking, e.g. with a dilution of from about 1:10 to about 1:100.<br>
The compositions of the invention, e.g. those in the examples hereinafter, may show good stability characteristics as indicated by standard stability trials, for example having a shelf life stability of up to one, two or three years, and even longer. One group of compositions of the invention may be of high stability that are capable, on addition to water, of providing aqueous microemulsions having an average particle size of 
The compositions of the invention exhibit especially advantageous properties when administered orally; for example in terms of consistency and high level of bioavaiiability obtained in standard bioavaiiability trials.<br>
Pharmacokinetic parameters, for example drug substance absorption and measured for example as blood levels, also become surprisingly more predictable and problems in administration with erratic absorption may be eliminated or reduced. Additionally the pharmaceutical compositions are effective with biosurfactants or tenside materials, for example bile salts, being present in the gastro-intestinal tract. That is, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention are fully dispersible in aqueous systems comprising such natural tensides and thus capable of providing emulsion or microemulsion systems and/or particulate systems in situ which are stable. The function of the pharmaceutical compositions upon oral administration remain substantially independent of and/or unimpaired by the relative presence or absence of bile salts at any particular time or for any given individual.  The compositions of this invention may also reduce variability In inter- and intra-patient dose response.<br>
The utility of the compositions of the invention may be observed in standard clinical tests in, for example, known indications of active agent at dosages giving therapeutically effective active agent blood levels. Any increased bioavaiiability of the compositions of the invention may be observed in standard animal tests and in clinical trials.<br>
The dose of the active agent in the compositions of the invention is of the same order as, or up to half, that used in known compositions containing the active agent. The compositions of the invention show activity at concentrations from about 0.1 mg to about 40 mg/day of<br>
active agent, preferably from about 0.1 mg to about 20 mg/day, e.g. most preferably from about 0.1 to about 1 mg/day of active agent.<br>
A typical dose for the active agent is from 0.1 to 1 mg/day for treating proliferate diseases or diseases that are associated with or triggered by persistent angiogenesis. A proliferative disease is mainly a tumor disease (or cancer) (and/or any metastases). The inventive compositions are particularly useful for treating a tumor which is a breast cancer, Jung cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, including esophageal, gastric, small bowel, large bowel and rectal cancer, glioma, sarcoma such as those involving bone, cartilage, soft tissue, muscle, blood and lymph vessels, ovarian cancer, myeloma, female cervical cancer, endometrial cancer, head and neck cancer, mesothelioma, renal cancer, ureter, bladder and urethra! cancers, prostate cancer, skin cancers and melanoma. In particular, the inventive compositions are particularly useful for treating (i) a breast tumor; a lung tumor, e.g., non-small cell lung tumor; a gastrointestinal tumor, e.g., a colorectal tumor; or a genitourinary tumor, e.g., a prostate tumor; or (ii) a proliferative disease that is refractory to the treatment with other chemotherapeutics; or (Hi) a tumor that is refractory to treatment with other chemotherapeutics due to multidrug resistance. In a broader sense of the invention, a proliferative disease may furthermore be a hyperproliferative condition, such as a leukemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma.<br>
Thus in another aspect, the present invention provides a method of treatment of a subject suffering from a disorder treatable with a camptothecin derivative comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of a pharmaceutical composition of the invention to a subject in need of such treatment.<br>
