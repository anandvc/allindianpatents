				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention refers to the field of functional foods and supplements in the treatment of medical conditions. More specifically, the present invention relates to the treatment of conditions with lipid mixtures containing phytoaterols.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
All publications mentioned throughout this application are fully incorporated herein by reference, including aU references cited therein.<br>
Plant sterols are naturally occurring substances present in the diet as minor components of vegetable oils. Plant sterols have a role in plants similar to that of cholesterol in mammals, e.g. forming cell membrane structures. In human nutrition, both plant sterols and plant etanols are effective in lowering total plasma cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels. The term "phytosterols" covers plant sterols and plant stanola.<br>
Phytosterols are components of a normal diet, mainly coming from plant sources, e.g. vegetable oils, seeds, nuts and grain-based products. The typical consumption of plant sterols in Western diets ranges between 200 and 400 mg/d, whereas the intake of phytostanols, the saturated form of plant sterols, is negligible.<br>
The consumption of higher amounts of plant sterols and plant stanols lowers blood cholesterol levels by inhibiting the absorption of dietary and endogenously-produced cholesterol from the small intestine. This inhibition is related to the similarity in physico-chemical properties of plant sterols and stanols to cholesterol.<br><br>
The plant sterols/stanols are very poorly absorbable compounds. Studies on the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion have shown that plant sterols are poorly absorbed from the intestine (1 - 10%).<br>
The hypocholesterolemic action of phytosterols has been recognized since the early W5ffs [Jones et al (1997) Can. J. Physiol Pharmacoi. 75, 217-227]. The blood cholesterol-lowering effect of plant aterols has been investigated in a large number of clinical trials involving over 2,400 subjects, using doses as high as 25 grams per day for durations as long as three years. No significant adverse effects have been observed throughout the decades of medically supervised clinical efficacy testing or the general clinical use of plant sterols. Furthermore, the drug Cytellin (primarily (3-sitosterol) was prescribed for more than 20 years and had an excellent safety record. In addition, both plant sterols and plant stanols have been subjected to rigorous toxicological evaluation.<br>
Phytosterols or phytostanols, as well as their fatty acid esters and other derivatives, are common products provided as dietary supplements or as functional ingredients in a variety of health promoting foods and beverages, as well as dietary supplements, all in the aim of reducing blood levels of total cholesterol, and especially of LDL (low density lipoprotein) cholesterol.<br>
Hypercholeaterolemia (high blood cholesterol), which can be treated or controlled by phytosterols, is a major risk factor of cardiovascular disorders (CVD). CVB is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. Hypercholesterolemia also causes the formation and accumulation of plaque deposits in the arteries, which results in atherosclerosis, the pathological process underlying coronary heart disease (CHD), one kind of cardiovascular disorders.<br>
Type 2 diabetes and also the associated conditions known as diabesity and metabolic syndrome, are related to CVB, whose incidence has also dramatically increased over the last century. In most cases, cardiovascular disorders are enhanced and even triggered by such metabolic disorders or their onset and<br><br>
development is accelerated by said syndromes. These are also closely related to risk factors of abnormal blood lipid profile, especially high levels of total cholesterol and non-HDL cholesterol species, mainly LDL cholesterol.<br>
People at risk to develop a metabolic syndrome, diabetes, or obesity, as well as CVD or CHD, or that are already classified as patients of said conditions are cautioned to monitor and control their blood lipids profile, especially high levels of blood cholesterol. One of the most efficient methods to address this risk factor common to so many health conditions and risks is the ingestion of plant storole or stanols or their derivatives,<br>
A potent method of treatment that has been used to address such risk factor was the supplementation of both statins and phytosterols. Both active ingredients address high levels of blood cholesterol, each using a different mechanism of action. The pharmaceutical ingredients based on statins inhibit the de novo synthesis of cholesterol, while phytosterols inhibit the absorption of dietary and endogenously-produced cholesterol. It has been demonstrated that consumption of plant stanol esters by patients taking statin therapy but that still have elevated LDL-cholesterol levels, was able to further reduce the total and LDL cholesterol levels by up to 12% and 17%, respectively (Blair et al. (2000) Am. J, Cardiol. 86, 46-52]. In addition, treating subjects with primary hypercholesterolemia with statins and phytosterol-ester containing foods produced a purely additive effect on LDL cholesterol, reduction [Simons et al. (2002) Am. Cardiol. 90, 737-740]. In fact, Simons et al. have concluded that the addition of phytosterol-esters to statins therapy offers an LDL cholesterol reduction equivalent to doubling the dose of statins. Similar results were exhibited by others {Vuorio et al, (2000) Arterioscler. Thromb. Vase. Biol 500-506].<br>
Post-menopausal females demonstrate several typical symptoms, like hot flashes, night sweats, sleeplessness, vaginal dryness, and disorders such as osteoporosis, CVD and central nervous system related alterations (anxiety and mood swings,<br><br>
depression and cognitive decline). With regards to the CVD complications in this population, it is well established that the rate of myocardial infarction increases by 3 fold and that cerebrovascular disease rises rapidly. It is believed that estrogen plays role in protecting endothelial cell wall and possibly protecting against thrombosis, hence the aforementioned symptoms following its deficiency. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) has a clear role in the treatment of menopausal symptoms and osteoporosis. However, recent findings from Women Health Initiative (WHI) showed that taking HRT increases a woman's risk for heart disease, stroke, and pulmonary embolism. Recently, postmenopausal women (aged 50-55) consuming margarine-containing plant stanols for 6 weeks demonstrated a marked reduction of LDL cholesterol versus baseh'ne, while HDL-cholesterol levels were increased, so the LDL/HDL cholesterol ratio was reduced [Gylling and Miettinen (1999) Metabolism 48:575-580]. However, -following the different stanol interventions there was a notable decrease in a-and p-carotene concentrations while retinol, vitamin D and lipid standardized a-tocopherol levels were comparable to baseline values.<br>
Phytosterols have also been connected and shown to have anti-cancer effects. Epidemiologic and experimental studies suggest that dietary phytosterols may offer protection from the most common cancers in Western societies, such as colon, breast and prostate cancer. Populations at low breast cancer risk consume more dietary phytosterols than those at high risk. Several in vitro studies have suggested that phytosterols are toxic to human breast cancer and prostate cancer cells. In vivo animal experiments have demonstrated the inhibitory effect of phytosterols on the incidence, growth and metastasis of colon tumors, breast, and prostate cancer (Awad, A.B, and Fink C.S. (2000) J. Nutr, 180:2127-2130; Moreaua, R.A. et al. (2002) Progress in Lipid Research 41:467-500]. Although there is evidence that phytosterols have anti-carcinogenic properties, the mechanism by which they inhibit tumor growth is not yet known. However, possible mechanisms by which phytosterols offer this protection include direct effect on membrane structure and function of tumor and host tissue, signal<br><br>
transduction pathways that regulate tumor growth a ad apoptosis [Awad and Fink (2000) id ibid].<br>
One of the major risk factors to CVD and CHD, as well as of metabolic disorders such as diabetes type 2, is oxidative stress, a relative increase in free radicals. These are responsible, for example, for the increased formation of oxidized-LDL, which when found at relatively high levels, is responsible to the formation of foam cells, the hallmark of early atherosclerosis. Free radicals may be found at high levels in the blood and other tissues due to a variety of causes, some environmental, such as increased pollution, or related to poor nutrition, due to ingestion of pro-oxidative nutrients, or to insufficient ingestion of different anti-oxidative nutrients. In addition, elevated free radicals levels are common in metabolic conditions such as type 2 diabetes, diabesity and metabolic syndrome, accompanied with sustained blood hyperglycemic state. Oxidative stress can be treated or may be even prevented by a variety of active ingredients possessing anti-oxidative activity, basically neutralizing free radicals found in the body.<br>
Phytosterols could have a possible role in prevention of inflammation-related conditions or disorders, including lymphocyte proliferative responses, pulmonary tuberculosis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), stress-induced immune suppression, rheumatoid arthritis, and allergic rhinitis/sinusitis [Bouic (2001) Opin Clin Nutr. Metab. Care 4:471-475]. The mechanisms by which plant sterols display their anti-inflammatory activity are thought to include inhibition of secretion of inflammatory mediators such as interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-a by monocytes; however most of the work has been conducted using animals models and therefore the specific mechanism, remain to be elucidated.<br>
Phytosterols also present anti-ulcer activity, protecting against Helicobacter pylori infection. In a recent study, phytosterol esters, but not sterols, in horse gram (an herb in the genus Dolichos cultivated in India for food and fodder) were protective in a pyloric ligation model of ulcer [Jayaraj et al. (2003) Phytother Res 17:391-398]. Together with sterols and phospholipids, these food lipids in diets<br><br>
may account for the low prevalence of duodenal ulcer in certain geographical areas, despite a uniformly high prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection.<br>
Any treatment addressing said disorders and/or conditions needs to be accompanied by a healthy and balanced nutrition. This nutrition should of course provide the patient with all the essential nutrients, among these vitamins. Many of the vitamins are lipophilic, and among those important to such patients are vitamin A and vitamin E. These vitamins also possess anti-oxidative activity which is important to protect the body from oxidative stress and perhaps prevent the damages of free radical activities. Vitamin A, also known as retinol, is a carotenoid vitamin (see Scheme 1). Vitamin A is produced in the liver from different provitamin carotenoids, especially from beta-carotene, the most important provitamin A, and an anti-oxidant in itself. Vitamin E, also known as alpha-tocopherol, is mainly found in plant sources, and is also a potent anti-oxidant. This lipophilic vitamin is usually accompanied by other derivatives of the tocopherols skeleton, such as beta and gamma tocopherols.<br>
While phytosterols and phytostanols, and their fatty acid esters, are one of the most efficient methods of treatment of the hypercholesterolemia risk factor, either alone or in combination with statins or other ingredients, recent studies have shown that the use of these phyto-ingredients may bring adverse effects. The primary concern regarding phytosterol supplementation is the effect it may have on the absorption and circulating levels of lipid soluble vitamins and carotenoids. Dietary phytosterols inhibit the absorption of dietary and biliary cholesterol, which in turn decreases the absorption of carotenoids and lipid soluble vitamins [Noakes et al. (2002) Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 75(l):79-86]. This presents a concern because, as mentioned above, there are many health benefits associated with dietary consumption of carotenoids and vitamins [Hendriks et al. (1999) Eur. J. Om. Nutr. 68(4): 819-827],<br>
Moreover, several clinical trials were identified in which the consumption of phytosterols was reported to induce a significant decrease in plasma carotenoid<br><br>
levels [Katan et al (2003) Mayo Clin. Proc. 78(8): 965-978]. These decreases followed the consumption of spread or oils containing between 0.83 and 3.6 g phytosterols/day for periods of 3 to 52 weeks. Recently, the bioavailability of beta-carotene and alpha-tocopheroi was reported to decrease in mildly overweight male volunteers following the consumption of 2.2 g phytosterols/day for a year [Richelle et al. (2004) Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 80(1): 171-177]. However, in this trial, plant sterol esters reduced the bioavailability of beta-carotene and alpha-tocopherol more than free plant sterols did. The reduction in beta-carotene levels was as high as 50%.<br>
In addition, while the beneficial effect of phytosterol and statins combination therapy was demonstrated [Vuorio (2000) id ibid,], monitoring the blood levels of vitamin A, vitamin E, as well as of alpha- and beta-carotene, revealed that this treatment has resulted in reduction of serum levels of all vitamins and provitamins, ranging from 10 to 50%. These effects were especially pronounced in children undergoing treatment due to a genetic condition [see review in Berger et al. (2004) Lipids Health Dis. 3:5-24].<br>
The European Union Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) has concluded that marketing of foods containing phytosterols should be accompanied by an investigation of possible adverse health effects, including among others the effects on plasma beta-carotene levels. The UK Food Advisory Committee (FAC) has recommended that consumers should be informed that phytosterol ester-containing products are not nutritionally appropriate for young children and breast feeding women as they do not need to reduce their blood cholesterol levels and there is a possibility of affecting vitamin A levels. The Scientific Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has emphasized the need for risk management measures in order to minimize the likelihood of a daily intake exceeding 3 g phytosterols/phytostanols, the provision of appropriate information to consumers regarding the need for regular consumption of fruits and vegetables to address the potential beta-carotene lowering effect of the product.<br><br>
Lichtenstein and colleagues [Lichtenstein et al. (2001) Circulation. 103: 1177-] 179] have pointed potential risks associated with the use of plant stanol/sterol ester-containing fata, among them observations of decreased levels of alpha and beta carotene, alpha-tocopherol, and/or lycopene in the plasma, as a result of the consumption of foods containing both stanol esters and sterol esters.<br>
Since food products containing plant sterols are likely to be shared during meals by all family, members, the potential for intake by non-hypercholesterolemic individuals is significant. Thus, the American Heart Association recommended that further studies and large-scale monitoring be undertaken to determine the long-term safety of plant sterol/stanol ester-containing foods in both normocholesterolemic and hypercholesterolemic adults, as well as in children.<br>
As with adverse interactions between pharmaceutical active ingredients, the same should be avoided between different active ingredients or nutrients, either pharmaceutical or dietary, that may be utilized or that are required to address the health needs of CVD and other health conditions as described above. Such interactions may reduce the effectiveness or intake of one or more of the ingredients used in the treatment. On some cases, the interaction of the ingredients used in the treatment of said conditions may cause the reduction of the effectiveness or intake of other dietary nutrients or ingredients, needed by the individual to maintain his general health and to be able to cope with the specific risk factors for which he is being treated for. In general, the observed adverse effect of phytosterol administration on the intake of vitamin A and beta-carotene, as well as of vitamin E, may also be relevant to other dietary nutrients, active pharmaceutical ingredients or dietary active ingredients which are lipophilic as the carotene-ids and tocopherols. Such lipophilic dietary nutrients, active pharmaceutical ingredients or dietary active ingredients that their intake or effectiveness may he further compromised by parallel administration of phytosterols include pharmaceutical anti-dyslipidemia ingredients, natural anti-oxidants, nutritional or active lipids, etc. Schemes 1 and 2 exemplify the chemical<br><br>
structure of several lipophilic active ingredients and dietary nutrients as well as of vitamin A and E.<br><br><br>

PharmaceuticaUy active ingredients have been developed with the goal of controlling high levels of blood cholesterol, and are widely used in the treatment of populations at risk regarding the above described conditions. Perhaps the most popular approach relies on active ingredients of the statins chemical family, known to inhibit the biosynthetic pathway of cholesterol production, hence leading to lower levels of blood cholesterol levels. Other active ingredients used are bile acid-binding resins, cholesterol absorption inhibitors, combination cholesterol absorption inhibitors and statins, fibrates, and niacin.<br>
A variety of synthetic anti-oxidants have been used for industrial and food purposes. Current methodology prefers the utilization of natural anti-oxidants, mainly derived from phyto-eources. Such plant derived anti-oxidants include lycopene, mainly found in red plants, especially tomatoes, and lutein. Other phyto-originated anti-oxidants include zeaxanthin and beta-carotene. All these anti-oxidants can be classified as highly lipophilic, which is a direct result of their common carotene-idle skeleton. Other anti-oxidants include those of the polyphenolic chemical characteristics. Such carotenoid, polyphenolic and other lipophilic natural anti-oxidants are all useful in the treatment of the above described conditions and their parallel administration to phytosterols should be beneficial.<br><br>
Omega-3 long chain poly-unsaturated tatty acids (LC-PUFA), especially docosahexaenoie acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) have been recognized as promoting cardiovascular health, partly due to the anti-hypertriglyceridemia activity. The US Food and Drug Administration (PDA) has announced on September 2004 that these fatty acids have earned a qualified health claim for the reduction of the risk of CHD by consumption of EPA- and DMA-containing foods or dietary sxipplements. Indeed, the consumption of these fatty acids can be beneficial to the populations suffering from the disorders or conditions discussed above or to populations wishing to prevent or inhibit the onset of said conditions.<br>
All these ingredients, as well as others, may be used, in combination or alone, in order to address the risk factors of CVD, CHD, metabolic disordered patients, high risk populations, cancer patients, etc.<br>
Other lipophilic pharmaceutical active ingredients, as well as other lipophilic dietary supplements, mainly phyto-ingredients extracted or derived from different plant sources, are to be found or are under development to address different health conditions which require or may benefit from parallel administration or intake of phytosterols and/or their derivatives, and hence face the risk of their intake being compromised by said phytostorol administration.<br>
Therefore, in light of the beneficial effects of phytosterols as a method of treatment of hypercholesterolemia or in combination with additional ingredients addressing a variety of CVD, CHD, metabolic disordered health risks, including hypertriglyceridemia, hyperglycemia and oxidative stress, as well as other health conditions, such as cancer, it is a purpose of the invention to provide a method of treatment that will enable making the most of the beneficial effects of phytosterols/phytostanols and their esters without the possible adverse effects of inhibition of intake of other important ingredients such as vitamins, anti-oxidants and even pharmaceutical active ingredients.<br><br>
Overweight or obesity substantially increases the risk of morbidity from a number of conditions, including type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension, dyslipidemia, coronary heart disease, congestive heart: failure, stroke, gallbladder disease, hepatic steatosis, osteoarthritis, sleep apnea, and endometriai, breaat, prostate, and colon cancers. An increase in all-cause mortality is also associated with higher body weights. Many of these conditions can be treated or prevented by the use of phytosterols/phytostanols and their esters.<br>
It is a further purpose of the invention to provide a method of treatment providing the beneficial effects of phytosterols/phytostanols and their esters on hypercholesterolemia while also controlling, and even promoting a reduction in a patient's body weight.<br>
Thus, it is an object of the present invention to provide a method of treatment for conditions which require phytosterol therapy without adversely affecting the bioavailability of any one of lipophilic vitamins, lipophilic drugs, lipophilie nutrients, or any lipophilic pharmaceutically active ingredient, through the administration of a mixture of PS-E (phytosterol ester(s)) and DAG (mainly 1,3 diglyceride(s)), dissolved or dispersed in an edible oil or fiat, or a composition or food article comprising the same, to a subject in need.<br>
This and other objects of the invention will become apparent as the description proceeds.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
Dietary phytosterola inhibit the absorption of dietary and biliary cholesterol, and long-term daily consumption of phytosterols induces depletion in plasma cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol concentrations. These reductions are related to a few factors, including: the dose of phytosterols consumed, the esterification of the phytosterol, the matrix the phytosterols are solubilized in, the background diet, as well as genetic factors. The main undesirable effect of administering phytosterols is that they can interfere with the absorption of many other fat-, soluble dietary ingredients, such as vitamins (especially carotenoids), as well as fat-soluble drugs. Moreover, the matrix in which the phytosterols are solubilized in can clearly affect the efficacy of phytosterols in lowering LDL cholesterol. It is hypothesized that during the absorption processes in the intestine, phytosterols could displace not only cholesterol but also other Hpophilic molecules and replace them in incorporation into mixed micelles. The partition into the mixed micellar<br><br>
phase could be influenced by the esterification and by other ingredients of the vehicle in which the phytosterols are consumed.<br>
Scientists at NestM's Research Centre have reported that plant sterols, added to foods to reduce cholesterol absorption, can also diminish the ability of the body to absorb beta-carotene and vitamin E [Richelle (2004) id ibid.]. This undesirable side effect is greater with the consumption of sterol esters than with free sterols.<br>
The present inventors have observed that a combination of phytosterol and/or phytostanol ester(s) (PS-E) and DAG, mainly l,3-diacylglycerol(s), provided in the diet, has conferred a beneficial health effect as part of a method of treatment for hypercholesterolemia, for example, without compromising the intake or serum levels of carotenoids, and specifically vitamin A.<br>
By DAG is meant a mixture of 1,2-diglycerides and 1,3-diglycerides, containing mainly 1,3-diglycerides (about 80%).<br>
The sterol-esters and DAG composition described herein does not adversely affect the intake of tocopherols or carotenoids upon its consumption. On the contrary, it maintains it in a steady-state level.<br>
When referring to tocopherol, it is to he understood as including alpha- and beta-tocopherols, as well as vitamin E and other nutritionally or health beneficial derivatives. Similarly, when referring to carotenoids, it is to he understood as including alpha- and beta-carotene, lycopene, vitamin A and other nutritionally or health beneficial derivatives.<br>
The inventors had previously shown that a composition comprising a combination of DAG, mainly 1,3-diacylglycerol, and PS-E dissolved in canola, olive or fish oil has idle property of reducing blood levels of cholesterol and triglycerides as well as lowering the oxidation levels of macrophages, serum and serum LDL in<br><br>
experimental animals [WO 2004/069150]. Moreover, this composition also inhibited the formation of foam cells [WO 2004/069150].<br>
In the present study, conducted in humans, a substantial decrease in total cholesterol concentrations was observed following the fish oil treatment (LC-PUFA), while control diet consumption induced a significant though smaller hypocholesterolemic effect (Table 2). Thus, treatment with PS-E+DAG-fish (Preparation A) resulted in reduction of total cholesterol concentration, compared to diets containing no supplemented plant sterols, as well as to the omega-3 containing treatment.<br>
PS-E+DAG-fish (Preparation A) has further proven to have potent hypocholesterolemic and hypotriglyceridemic effects, and to be suited for treatment of dyslipidemic individuals, shown to be susceptible to metabolic syndrome and diabetes.<br>
However, due to their mechanism of action, plant sterols ester-enriched products can affect absorption of fat-soluble vitamins. Lower serum a-tocopherol concentrations following phytostanol consumption is not an unexpected finding since most tocopherol is carried in LDL particles, which are shown in numerous studies to decrease upon plant sterol consumption. Similarly, levels of several carotenoids, but especially alpha- and beta-carotene are also susceptible to change following plant sterol esters consumption, in a similar manner.<br>
Surprisingly, the present study shows that the PS-E-DAG compositions developed by the inventors can guard the levels of circulating vitamins.<br>
As demonstrated in Table 4 and Figure 1, treatment with PS-E+DAG-fish (Preparation A) resulted in an increase in the levels of vitamin A absorption, in comparison with PS-E (P-value=0.05). Pair-wise comparison to PS-E blood levels of retinal suggested 5.1% higher concentration in subjects treated with PS-E+DAG-fish (Preparation A). Figure 1 presents these significant differences as a<br><br>
percent of change from control diet median levels. These results indicate that plant sterols esters provided at equivalent dose in a J)AG-conr,ainiiig matrix have a greater effect on Vitamin A bioavailability than PS-E alone,<br>
Thus, it is of major importance that PS-E+DAG-fish (Preparation A), besides its hypocholesterolemic effect, also maintained the blood levels of fat-soluble vitamins. This makes the composition described herein an important improvement in the field of phytosterol-based therapies. As mentioned before, phytosterols have been widely used for lowering circulating cholesterol. However, due to their capacity to "absorb" circulating lipid molecules, phytosterols can also affect the levels of other circulating lipid or lipophilic molecules, and thus become harmful to the body. Nonetheless, the composition presented herein did not have this adverse effect.<br>
Therefore the composition provided by the present invention provides an advantage over similar compositions presently available in the market, in that it promotes protection to the levels of circulating vitamins. Similarly, it may be expected that also the levels of other lipophilic molecules, such as lipophilic drugs or other pharmaceutically active ingredients, including nutrients, shall be guarded upon consumption of the PS-E-DAG compositions provided herein.<br>
The amount of the therapeutic or pharmaceutical composition of the invention which is effective in the treatment of a particular disease, condition or disorder will depend on the nature of the disease, condition or disorder and can be determined by standard clinical techniques. In addition, in, vitro assays as well as in vivo experiments may optionally be employed to help identify optimal dosage ranges. Effective doses may be extrapolated from dose-response curves derived from in vitro or animal model test systems.<br>
The therapeutically effective amount for purposes herein is that determined by such considerations as are known in the art. The amount must be sufficient, e.g., to enable the lowering cholesterol effect of phytosterols, while not adversely<br><br>
affecting the bioavailability of other lipophilic molecules, such as vitamins, or pharmaceutically active ingredients such as statins, and other lipophilic drugs or dietary ingredients. Said lipophilic molecules, and especially lipophilic drugs, may have been obtained orally, or through other means, such as intravenously, sub-cutaneously, intra-peritoneally, intra-muscularly or trans-dermally (through a skin patch).<br>
The various methods of treatment as well as the method of improving weight management provided in the present invention involve the administering a therapeutically effective amount of a mixture of PS-E and DAG dissolved or dispersed in an edible oil or fat, or a composition or food article comprising thereof, as described herein. The preferred method of administration of the mixture, composition or food article, as might be the case, is oral. Nonetheless, especially for the mixture and composition, other methods of administration are also feasible, such as via intravenous (i.v.), sub-cutaneous (s.c.), intra-peritoneal (i.p,), intra-muacular (i.m.) or trans-dermal (t.cL, skin patch). The food article may be a solid food article, a beverage, or a paste.<br>
In other words, the compositions or mixtures described herein are primarily for the treatment of conditions that require phytosterol therapy, and in that context maintain the bioavailability of lipophilic circulating molecules, like vitamins, lipophilic drugs, lipophilic nutrients, etc. Alternatively, said compositions axe also to be used in parallel or in combination with the treatment of other conditions, which require the use of lipophilic drugs, such as for example certain analgesics, anesthaetics, immune suppressors, HIV-protease inhibitors, anti-malaria drugs, psychotropic agents, amongst others.<br>
The compositions described herein have also demonstrated properties with regards to treating obesity. Obesity is an escalating problem worldwide and a major risk factor for atherosclerosis, hypertension and type 2 diabetes. As shown in Example 4, the average BMI levels demonstrated a tendency to reduction upon treatment with the PS-E+DAG-oEve (Preparation B) composition, particularly in<br><br>
females. As shown in Figure 2, the biggest and the most significant effect on reducing BMI levels, as compared with control, was obtained as a result of PS-B+DAG-olive (Preparation B) supplementation.<br>
To date, no comparable results of BMI reduction following phytosterols interventional study were reported, including a recent publication in which similarly restricted diet was provided to diabetic and non-diabetic subjects [Lau et al. (2005) Am J, Clin. Nutr. 81:1351-1358]. Although the connection between obesity, dyslipidemia and diabetes is well documented, there has been no report of a drug, or dietary supplement, that provides the reduction of blood lipid levels, BMI, while maintaining the fat-soluble vitamin levels.<br>
Thus it is a purpose of the invention to provide a method of treatment to a variety of disorders requiring addressing hypercholesterolemic conditions or preventive/maintenance treatment for populations for which the development of a hypercholesterolemic conditions or its escalation may make said population prone to develop a more severe health condition, such as CVD, CHD, atherosclerosis or a metabolic syndrome, such as diabetes type 2 or obesity. In addition, the following conditions may also be treated with the composition described herein: cancer, benign prostatic hypertrophy, ulcer, prostatitia, pulmonary tuberculosis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), stress-induced immune suppression, rheumatoid arthritis, and allergic rhinitis/sinusitis. Said method of treatment includes providing phytosterols, preferably phytosterol esters, in combination with diglycerides, and optionally triglycerides, to inflict reduction of blood cholesterol levels while maintaining normal intake levels of other lipophilic active ingredients and/or nutrients. Said active ingredients may be pharmaceutical ingredients, such as statins, used to lower cholesterol levels by inhibition of the biosynthetic pathway of their production. Treatments using statins and phytosterols have been shown to have an additive beneficial effect Additionally, said ingredients may be anti-oxidants, preferably natural carotenoids anti-oxidants, such as lutein, beta-carotene, and lycopene. The use of such anti-oxidants is beneficial in this context since most target populations for<br><br>
the treatment described herein suffer or are prone to suffer from oxidative stress, which may worsen their cardiovascular or aietabolic syndrome condition. Further ingredients may also include Omega-3 LC-PUFA, especially 0HA and EPA,<br>
The results described in Example 4 show that circulating levels of phytosterols can be affected by modification in the diet. Moreover, consumption of the PS-E+DAG composition of the invention increased the bioavailability of plrytosterols and stanols, such as beta-sitosterol, compared to PS-E diet. Thus, the composition described herein may definitely enhance the efficacy of phytosterols as anti-cancer agents, as well as their other health benefits.<br>
Additionally, a number of conditions may arise from decreased levels of fat-<br>
soluble vitamins, and thus subjects suffering from or prone to develop said<br>
conditions are very good candidates for therapeutic and/or prophylactic treatment<br>
with the composition described herein, which sustains the levels of circulating<br>
vitamins. Among said conditions are stroke, diabetes, breast cancer, immune<br>
deficiency, immune suppression, osteoporosis, osteopenia, photo-aging, skin<br>
tumor, photosensitivity reaction, cataractogenesis and cataracts, retinal<br>
photodeterioration,	erythrocyte	photochemolysis,	photoerythema,<br>
photocarcinogenesis, Crohn's disease, short bowel syndrome, Alzheimer's disease, dementia, infantile nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, multiple sclerosis.<br>
In particular, lipophilic active ingredients such as dietary lipophilic vitamins, and other dietary lipophilic nutrients whose normal intake is crucial for maintaining a good general health condition, are Important targets of the method of treatment described herein. In a preferred embodiment said dietary lipophilic vitamins are carotenoid or tocopherol based and include vitamin A, vitamin E, their provitamins and their isomers and derivatives. In some cases said carotenoid and/or tocopherol vitamins are considered as anti-oxidants.<br><br>
In general, the absorption of a variety of other lipophilic molecules such as pharmaceutical ingredients and phyto-ingred.ier.ts that partition into the intestinal oil/micelle phase are compromised by the phytosteroLs solubility. Thus, the method of treatment of the invention provides the means to treat hypercholesterolemic conditions or pro-hypercholesterolemic conditions without inhibiting the intake or bioavailability of other active ingredients or dietary nutrients whether these are needed to treat the same or related aspects of the condition (CVD, CHD, metabolic syndromes) or other health conditions or disorders which the intake of the active ingredients required for their treatment may be compromised by the parallel treatment with phytosterols or their esters.<br>
Thus, a yet further aspect of the present invention is to provide a method of treating and/or preventing conditions related to metabolicaily-induced overweight, said method consisting of administering a therapeutically effective amount of the dietary nutrient or food supplement, or the composition of the invention, as previously described. Said conditions are any one of obesity, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia and metabolic syndrome.<br>
Thus, according to the invention, as part of the method of treatment, said combination of phytosterol esters, while addressing hypercholesterolemia and maintaining adequate intake levels of other lipophilic active ingredients or dietary nutrients, provides also weight control and even weight reduction. As discussed above, weight control and/or reduction are important parts of the treatment and/or prevention of the health conditions addressed by this method of treatment.<br>

Examples<br>
Methods<br>
Hitman Clinical Study Design<br>
This study was designed as a randomized, single-blind, cross-over clinical<br>
intervention trial. This experiment involved testing the effects of dietary<br>
matrices containing specific fatty acid and/or plant sterol mixtures included in<br>
normal diets, compared to non-supplemented diets, on vitamins absorption and<br>
on weight gain, in moderately overweight subjects with elevated serum lipid<br>
levels for whom dietary modification is the primary and at times only therapeutic<br>
recommendation.<br><br>
Patients<br>
Twenty-four (24) volunteers (11 male, 13 female, age 30-65 yr) with LDL-cholesterol concentrations &gt; 130 mg/dL were recruited tor this study. Body mass indices (BMI) of subjects ranged from 23-32 kg/m2, except for three subjects in which BMI was between 21.4 and 23 kg/m2. Twenty-one volunteers completed the study (11 male, 10 female).<br>
Diets<br>
All volunteers underwent a feeding trial according to a semi-randomized Latin square cross-over design containing five dietary phases, each four week in duration. The control diet was provided first, then the other phases randomized. Each feeding period was separated by a 4-week washout interval, during which volunteers consumed their typical diets without restriction. The composition of the diets was similar with respect to the food and nutrient content. The basic diet contained 30% of energy as fat (see control diet), 80 mg cholesterol/1000 kcal, 12 g fiber/1000 kcal, 15% energy as protein and 55% as carbohydrates. The variable component was the treatment oil.<br>
Diets were designated as:<br>
Control group:	baseline plant sterol level of about 200mg/day,<br>
where the dietary fat was comprised at 70% energy as oleic acid-enriched vegetable oil.<br>
LC-PUFA group:	7.6g/day of fish oil providing the same amount<br>
of EPA and DHA as the plant sterol-fish oil ester diet.<br>
PS-E+DAG-fish (Preparation A)<br>
(Omega-3-esters mfotuye) group: 1.7 g/day soy sterols esterified to fish oil fatty<br>
acids (including EPA and DHA), contained in a<br><br>
diglyceride and triglyceride containing fish oil {commercial fish oil. manufactured by Pronova, Lysaker, Norway) (total amount^O g/d).<br><br>
PS-E:<br>
1.7 g/d soy sterol esterified to polyunsaturated fatty acids like linoleic acid (LA) and OA, which resembles       the      commercially      available phytostcrol esters product. PS-E+DAG-olive (Preparation B)<br>
(PS-E+DAGft group:	1.7 g/day soy sterols esterified to olive oil fatty<br>
acids (predominantly oleic acid), contained in a diglyceride (DAG) and triglyceride containing olive oil (commercial extra virgin olive oil, manufactured by Meshek Eger, Yokeneam HaMoshava, Israel) (total amount=9 g/d) .<br>
TABLE REMOVED<br><br>
*levels of the different sterols, which can be either esterificd or non-esterined<br>
All meals were equicaloric and breakfast was consumed each day under supervision. The treatment oil was given within the breakfasts consumed every day at the clinic under supervision. Volunteers were instructed to eat and drink only materials given to them by the Clinical Nutrition Research Unit (McGill University, Montreal, Canada), except for water. Study volunteers were encouraged to maintain their usual level of physical activity. Energy requirements were estimated using the Mifflin equation and multiplied by an activity factor of 1.7. Energy intakes were adjusted over the initial 2-week period to maintain constant body weight and kept constant for the remaining 4 weeks and the other treatment phases,<br>
Blood lipid analyses<br>
On days 1, 2, 28 and 29, blood samples were obtained in the fasting state. Plasma was immediately separated and stored at -80°C until analysis. Total cholesterol, phytosterol, as well as triglycerides levels, were measured in samples taken on days 1, 2, 28 and 29 of each phase. Levels of plasma total cholesterol and triglyceride were determined by automated methods in duplicate on an Abbott Spectrum CCX Analyzer (Abbott, Dallas, TX) utilizing enzymatic reagents (Abbott A-GENT). Plasma phytosterol concentrations were determined by GLC (HP5890 series IT: Hewlett-Packard). Vitamin E (a-tocopherol) and Vitamin A (retinol) levels were measured in samples from days 1 and 28, and quantified through HPLC. Plasma leptin levels were determined at the end of each phase through radioimmunoassay.<br>
Anthropometric measurements:<br>
The following determinations were performed in triplicates at the beginning (days 1, 2, and 3) and termination (days 27, 28, and 29) of each of the five dietary phases. Weight was measured daily before breakfast in light clothing without<br><br>
shoes. Height was measured as the distance from the top of the head to the bottom of the feet (no shoes) using a fixed stadiometer. BMT was calculated as the weight (kg) divided by the square of the height (m).<br>
Example 1<br>
Hypocholesterolemic effect of PS-E-HDAG-fish (Preparation A)<br>
Hypercholesteroleinic overweight volunteers were fed for four weeks with control diet, LC-PUFA oil, PS-E+DAG-fish (Preparation A) or PS-E followed by four weeks of washout and counter supplementation. Total cholesterol levels were tested at the beginning and at the termination of each phase as described in methods. The results are shown in Table 2. Values represent mean±S.E.M of the total cholesterol levels in 21 patients at the indicated time points as well as percent of change. Statistical significance between the different treatments as found by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post hoc test between the percent of change values was P-value
As shown in Table 2, both the baseline and the endpoint of the total cholesterol concentrations were comparable in all subjects through the different diet phases consumption (P-value=0.99 and 0,61, respectively). However, all these treatments induced a significant reduction in the percentage of total cholesterol concentrations, although to different degree (P-value=O.Q57). Post Hoc evaluations suggest PS-E+DAG-fish (Preparation A) to demonstrate the most pronounced positive effect in this parameter, i.e. decreased the total cholesterol levels.<br><br><br>
Example 2<br>
Hypotrigiyceridemia effect of PS~E+DAG-fish (Preparation A)<br>
Hypercholesterolemic overweight volunteers were fed for four weeks with control diet, LC-PUFA oil, PS-E+DAG-fish (Preparation A) or PS-E followed by four weeks of washout and counter supplementation. Triglycerides levels were tested at the beginning and at the termination of each phase, under fasting conditions, as described in methods. The results are shown in Table 3. Values represent meaniSEM of triglycerides levels in 21 patients at the indicated time points as well as percent of change. Statistical significance between the different treatments as found by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post hoc test between the endpoint values was P-value
As previously shown for the plasma cholesterol containing component of these volunteers, the baseline values were virtually similar (P-values=0.33). The end result of administrating these treatments was shown to be beneficial in reducing triglycerides levels in these hypercholesterolemic subjects. However, there was an unambiguously difference between the efficacy of omega-3 containing treatments to the other fatty acids diets (P-valu0=0.0036). Un-reacted fish oil decreased plasma fasting triglycerides by 37.1% (P-value^Q.OOT) while the comparable effect of the omega-3 esters mixture of the invention (PS-E+DAG-fish<br><br>
(Preparation A)) was 42.9% decrease (P-Value-0.00002), yet there was only a mild tendency tiiat suggests a difference between the effects of these supplementations (Student's t-test Paired analysis the P-value^O.112). Comparing the effects of these supplements on fasting triglycerides levels to the rather mild effect of the control diet (-5.3%; P-Value=0.04) and PS-E (-8,7%; P-value=0.04) provides a statistically significant difference between the consumption offish oil to vegetable oil (see Table 3).<br>

Hypercholesterolemic overweight volunteers were fed for four weeks with control<br>
diet, LC-PUFA oil, PS-E+DAG-fish (Preparation A) or PS-E followed by four<br>
weeks of washout and counter supplementation. Vitamins levels were tested at<br>
the termination of each phase, as described in methods. The results are shown in<br>
Figure 1 and Table 4. Values represent mean±SEM of vitamin A levels obtained<br>
from 21 patients in Table 4 and as % of change from control diet median in<br>

Student's t-test Paired analysis was p-value
 <br><br>
Supplementation with plant sterols diet, ie. PS-E, resulted in a reduction (-5%) of the bioavailability of vitamin A (retinol) compared to the control olive oil (65.0 ± 2.3 ug/dL, and 68.2 ± 2.5 ug/dL, respectively). However, supplementation with Preparation A (a combination of plant sterols and diglycerides in fish oil) was shown to be comparable to control diet levels (P-value=0.41) and demonstrated a small, yet significant increase in vitamin A plasma concentrations compared to consumption of the PS-E diet (69.1 ± 2.3 fig/dL and 66.0 ± 2.5 ug/dL, respectively; P-value=0.05). Consistent with this trend, the paired change of the hypercholesterolemic subject vitamin A concentration between the endpoint levels following PS-E and PS-E+DAG-fish (Preparation A) diets, suggested that the latter diet consumption resulted in 5.1% higher plasma vitamin A levels. Similar observations were obtained comparing vitamin A levels to control diet median value (see Figure 1).<br>
Example 4<br>
Effect  of PS-E+DAG-fish   (Preparation  A)   on  plasma  plant   sterols<br>
concentrations<br>
Hypercholesterolemic overweight volunteers were fed for four weeks with control diet, LC-PUFA oil, PS-E+DAG-fish (Preparation A) or PS-E followed by four weeks of washout and counter supplementation. Phytosterols levels were tested at the beginning and at the termination of each phase, as described in methods. The results are shown in Table 6. Values represent meartfcSEM of beta-sitosterol levels in 21 patients at the indicated time points as well as percent of change. Statistical significance between the different treatments as found by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post hoc test between the endpoint values was P-<br><br>
value
There were no differences between treatments groups at baseline (P-value=0.44). However, the post-treatment values demonstrated significant differences between the indicated diets (P-value=0.03). These differences were more striking in the percent of change, as shown in Table 5 (P-value=0.0003). Both plant sterol containing diets demonstrated a marked increase in this parameter, nevertheless as evaluated by Student's t-test Paired analysis there was a distinct tendency between the effects of these supplementations (the P-Value-0.068). Comparable trend was obtained when the beta-sitosterol values were standardized to the cholesterol levels at the end of these dietary phases.<br>
TABLE REMOVED<br><br>
The human body does not synthesize phytoeterols endogenously. Circulating phytosterols are derived exclusively through intestinal absorption. Serum phytosterol levels in humans range from 6 to 41 nmol/L. Thus, the fact that the absolute change in beta-eitosterol concentration was greater in the preparation A dietary intervention group than in the PS-E group clearly demonstrates that sterol levels were affected according to the diet consumed. These results show that circulating levels of phytosterols can be affected by dietary modification. Moreover, consumption of the sterol-esters and DAG composition of the invention may increase the bioavailability of phytosterols and stands, such as beta-sitosterol, compared to PS-E diet, hence enhancing their efficacy as anti-cancer agents as well as other health benefits.<br><br>

Body weight gain<br>
Hypercholesterolemk mildly overweight volunteers were fed for four weeks with control diet, LC-PUFA oil, PS-E+DAG-fish (Preparation A), PS-E or PS-E+DAG-olive (Preparation B) followed by four weeks of washout and counter supplementation. Bodyweight levels were tested at the beginning and at the termination of each phase, as described in methods and BMI values were subsequently calculated. The % of change in BMI results for females are shown in Figure 2. Values represent mean±S.E.M of % of change in BMI in 10 female patients. Statistical significance between the indicated treatments as found by Student's t-test Paired analysis was P-value
As indicated in methods, 21 subjects completed all five diet periods. There were no differences in the energy intake among the five dietary groups. Weight was measured using a standard scale and BMI was calculated as the weight (kg) divided by the square of the height (m8). Initial and end-point BMI levels were calculated as the average of BMI measurements taken on the beginning (days 1, 2, and 3) and end (days 27, 28, and 29) of each of the five dietary phases.<br>
In the present study there was a slight however distinct decrease from baseline to endpoint BMI values in all five diet-periods (control 26.00*0.62 to 25.81±0.59, P-value=0.01; LC-PUFA 26.31±0.69 to 26.17±0.65, P-vaIue-0.10; PS-E+DAG-fish (Preparation A) 26.10±0.69 to 26.02±0.68, P-value=0.10; PS-E 26.27±0.64 to 26.14±0.63, P-value=0.01; Preparation B 26.18±0.63 to 26.00±0.62, P-value=0.001).<br>
Further evaluation of the change between the baseline to the endpoint levels of the BMI values in males and females, suggest that these vegetable oil based plant sterol treatments were more efficacious in reducing females BMI levels than these treatments comparable effect in mildly overweight males; average change from baseline to endpoint in control, PS-E and PS-E+DAG-olive<br><br>
(Preparation B) females was -0,09±0.02, -0,22±0.02 and -0.18±0.02, respectively, and in males -0.29±0.03, -0.14tO.02 and -0.09*0.02, respectively. Using a paired analysis to compare the percent change of the BMI values between these female subjects (n=10) was shown to be more prominent following supplementation with PS-E-KDAG-olive (Preparation B) compared with control olive oil diet (P-value=0,03; see Figure 2). This distinct and significant reduction in % of change of BMI levels in females, was not obtained comparing the control and PS-E supplement (P-value=0.28), indicating that the dietary matrix PS-E+DAG-olive (Preparation B) was more effective in reducing body weight than PS-E (Figure 2). Interestingly, these discrete effects on BMI levels between males and females presented by plant sterols containing diets were further correlated with a corresponding reduction in fasting leptin levels in females, in compared with control endpoint levels (-8.6*6,3% and -6,9±7.1% for Preparation B and PS-E), while similar analyses for males resulted with a contrary effect (2,1±6.3% and 6.5±4.6% for Preparation B and PS-E).<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
