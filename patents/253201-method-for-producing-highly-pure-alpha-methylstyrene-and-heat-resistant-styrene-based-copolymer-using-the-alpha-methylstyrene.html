				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
METHOD FOR PURIFYING a-METHYLSTYRENE AND HEAT-RESISTANT<br>
STYRENE-BASED COPOLYMER USING THE a-METHYLSTYRENE<br>
Technical Field<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a method for obtaining highly pure<br>
a-methylstyrene as a polymerization monomer. More particularly, the present<br>
invention relates a method for purifying a-methylstyrene to a high purity by removing<br>
polar substances, such as aldehydes and ketones, contained in trace amounts in<br>
a-methylstyrene by reaction in the presence of a basic substance, whereby efficient<br>
removal can be achieved without requiring a complex process. Moreover, the<br>
present invention relates to a styrene-based copolymer having little coloring, and<br>
superior heat resistance, weather resistance, melt stability, moidability, strength and<br>
rigidity able to be obtained by using this monomer.<br>
Background Art<br>
[0002]<br>
Styrene-based resins are used in an extremely wide range of applications as a<br>
result of not only having superior material performance in terms of transparency,<br>
rigidity, dimensional stability and the like, but also as a result of being able to be<br>
processed in various forms such as rolled sheets, films, foamed sheets, foamed<br>
boards and blow molded articles, and because many styrene-based resins can be<br>
produced inexpensively and in large volume by bulk polymerization using radical<br>
polymerization, solution polymerization using a high monomer concentration,<br>
1<br><br>
suspension polymerization or emulsion polymerization.<br>
[0003]<br>
Although typical examples of styrene-based resins may include polystyrene<br>
(GPPS), styrene/acrylonitrile (AS), styrene/methyl methacrylate (MS),<br>
styrene/methacrylic acid (SMAA), styrene/maleic anhydride (SMA) and the like,<br>
styrene homopolymers (polystyrene (GPPS)) is used the most universally<br>
[0004]<br>
Polystyrene has numerous superior properties, and because it is inexpensive,<br>
has high usage value and is used in various applications. Some major applications<br>
thereof are indicated below.<br>
(Packaging Applications)<br>
Lunchbox containers (foamed sheet: PSP), cup noodle containers (foamed<br>
sheet: PSP), clear cups, spoons, forks, vegetable packaging sheets (biaxially oriented<br>
sheets), envelop windows<br>
(Home Appliance Applications)<br>
Television, air-conditioner and OA equipment packaging, electric refrigerator<br>
trays, cassette, MD and MO shells<br>
(Miscellaneous Household Goods)<br>
Toys, stationary articles<br>
(Building Material Applications)<br>
Insulation (foamed boards), tatami mats (foamed boards)<br>
[0005]<br>
However, there were some applications that were unable to be satisfied even by<br>
the performance of this resin, such as applications that prevented this resin from<br>
being used due to insufficient heat resistance. More specifically, since the GPPS<br>
heat resistance is about 100°C (glass transition temperature), in applications involving<br>
2<br><br>
contact with hot steam for disinfection by boiling, food packaging applications<br>
requiring heating in a microwave oven or applications involving molded automotive<br>
parts susceptible to exposure to high temperatures in the summer, this resin was<br>
unable to be used without risk of causing deformation to the molded articles.<br>
[0006]<br>
One way of enhancing the heat resistance of polystyrene may include<br>
copolymerizing styrene with a monomer containing a polar functional group, examples<br>
of which may include copolymers of styrene and methacrylic acid (SMAA),<br>
copolymers of styrene and maleic anhydride (SMA) and copolymers of styrene and<br>
maleimide anhydride. Heat resistance can be arbitrarily changed by controlling the<br>
amount of monomer containing the polar functional group in the copolymer<br>
composition. For example, a typical example of a heat-resistant styrene-based resin<br>
in the form of SMAA has a Vicat heat resistance temperature of from 105 to 125°C.<br>
However, when polymers having the polar functional group are exposed to high<br>
temperatures, a crosslinking reaction of the polymer chain occurs due to side<br>
reactions of the polar groups, and as a result, gel-like substances are formed that<br>
cause a decrease in molding processability due to increased viscosity, thereby<br>
preventing these polymers from being adequately accepted by users from the<br>
viewpoints of quality and productivity.<br>
[0007]<br>
In addition, increased susceptible to the occurrence of crosslinking reactions<br>
under conditions of high-temperature melt retention means increased susceptibility of<br>
high molecular weight polymers to deformation during molding processing, thereby<br>
making it difficult to recycle and reuse resins. For example, when obtaining an<br>
injection molded article, end materials (skeletons) are generated during formation of<br>
sprue and runner components and when obtaining molded articles from biaxially<br>
3<br><br>
oriented sheets or foamed sheets. These are usually reused by partially mixing with<br>
virgin pellets after being crushed or cut up, or are typically reused by partially mixing<br>
into general-purpose resins such as polystyrene.<br>
[0008]<br>
However, reuse become difficult if the flow properties of a resin change due to<br>
crosslinking of high molecular weight polymers during melt processing, and there was<br>
the problem of limitations being placed on the use of these resins for recycling to<br>
virgin pellets. Moreover, copolymers containing the polar functional group typically<br>
have poor compatibility with polystyrene and even if mixed by melting, not only do<br>
they lead to a decrease in mechanical properties, but also cause a loss of<br>
transparency, thereby preventing these copolymers from being recycled to<br>
general-purpose polystyrene.<br>
[0009]<br>
With the increasing emphasis being placed on effective utilization of resins in<br>
recent years, various types of recycling methods have been developed and<br>
implemented. Being able to recycle, rework and reuse resins is an essential<br>
requirement on the resin markets of the future. Resin materials developed in the<br>
future will be required to be resins able to be effectively recycled without undergoing<br>
hardly any decrease in molecular weight or generation of monomers due to severing<br>
of the polymer chain even if going through several rounds of melt processing. Thus,<br>
there is a desire for the development of resin materials exhibiting higher melt stability<br>
than conventional styrene-based copolymers.<br>
[0010]<br>
Another problem of conventional heat-resistant styrene-based resins was the<br>
narrow range of processing conditions during molding. Improving the heat<br>
resistance of a copolymer is equivalent to improving the temperature at which flow of<br>
4<br><br>
the polymer chain begins. Thus, if it is desired to obtain flow properties similar to<br>
those of polystyrene during molding processing, it is necessary to raise the<br>
processing temperature corresponding to an improvement in heat resistance<br>
However, in the case of styrene-based copolymers containing the polar functional<br>
group, the decomposition starting temperature does not improve corresponding to<br>
heat resistance. Consequently, the molding processing temperature range becomes<br>
narrow and as a result, there were problems in terms of leading to decreases in<br>
productivity and quality.<br>
[0011]<br>
There are also methods for improving the heat resistance of styrene-based<br>
resins by using a monomer that does not contain the polar functional group For<br>
example, a copolymer of styrene and a-methylstyrene is known to demonstrate an<br>
increase in the glass transition temperature as the content of a-methylstyrene<br>
increases (see, for example, Non-Patent Document 1).<br>
[0012]<br>
However, in the case of attempting to copolymerize styrene and<br>
a-methylstyrene using a typical example of an industrial production process in the<br>
form of radical solution polymerization, none of these methods have been able to be<br>
used industrially due to numerous problems as indicated below:<br>
1)	high molecular weight polymerization is difficult due to the low ceiling<br>
temperature of a-methylstyrene of about 60°C;<br>
2)	target heat resistance cannot be obtained due to limitations on the content of<br>
a-methylstyrene in the copolymer; and<br>
3)	thermal decomposition of the copolymer occurs easily depending on molding<br>
processing conditions due to poor thermal stability during melting, thereby<br>
resulting in the generation of monomer components and susceptibility to<br><br><br>
decreases in molecular weight.<br>
[0013]<br>
On the other hand, since a-methylstyrene can undergo living anionic<br>
polymerization by using a butyl lithium initiator, copolymers of styrene and<br>
a-methylstyrene can be also be produced by living anionic polymerization (see, for<br>
example. Patent Document 1).<br>
Therefore, a method has been proposed for solving the problems of radical<br>
solution polymerization by carrying out living anionic polymerization according to a<br>
continuous living polymerization method using a complete mixing type of<br>
polymerization reactor (see, for example, Patent Document 2). This method is<br>
characterized by carrying out polymerization using a continuous type of complete<br>
mixing reactor such that the concentrations of a-methylstyrene monomer, styrene<br>
monomer and living copolymer present in the living polymerization reaction system<br>
remain constant at all times, and offers the following effects:<br>
1)	high molecular polymerization is possible due to the use of a living<br>
polymerization method;<br>
2)	the content of a-methylstyrene in the copolymer can be controlled since the<br>
concentration in the reaction system can be kept constant; and,<br>
3)	thermal stability during melting improves due to the absence of head-to-head<br>
bonds, tail-to-tail bonds and other unstable bonds in the main chain of<br>
copolymer due to the use of anionic polymerization.<br>
[0014]<br>
However, living anionic polymerization Is typically susceptible to the effects of<br>
impurities contained in the raw materials. In particular, active anions are known to<br>
easily react with polar substances such as water, aldehydes, ketones and alcohols<br>
If polar substances are present, even in trace amounts, in an anionic polymerization<br>
6<br><br>
reaction system, the active anions react with the polar substances resulting in the<br>
formation of stable bonds, thereby causing the problem of interrupting polymerization.<br>
Consequently, when carrying out living anionic polymerization, polar substances in<br>
raw materials must be reduced, and entrance of polar substances into the reaction<br>
system must be suppressed as much as possible.<br>
[0015]<br>
In addition, the above-mentioned polar substances and reaction products of<br>
active anions and polar substances undergo degeneration during the course of the<br>
polymerization process resulting in the possibility of the formation of colored<br>
substances. In this case, this can result in coloring of the polymer or decreases in<br>
polymer physical properties, thereby making this undesirable. From this viewpoint<br>
as well, polar substances in the raw materials are preferably eliminated as much as<br>
possible.<br>
[0016]<br>
However, the typical process for industrial production of α-methylstyrene is the<br>
cumene-phenol production process. This cumene-phenol production process<br>
contains a step in which cumene hydroperoxide obtained by oxidation of raw material<br>
cumene is concentrated to 80 to 85% followed by acid decomposition to phenol and<br>
acetone and neutralization / washing. The resulting crude phenol contains such<br>
substances as acetone, water, cumene, a-methylstyrene and phenol, and purified<br>
phenol is produced from this crude phenol by distillation, while at the same time,<br>
acetone and a-methylstyrene are respectively separated and recovered (see, for<br>
example, Patent Documents 3 and 4).<br>
[0017]<br>
However, in the case of attempting to respectively separate and recover acetone<br>
and a-methylstyrene simultaneous to production of purified phenol using the process<br>
7<br><br>
described above, the following problems occur. Namely, substances having a boiling<br>
point close to that of a-methylstyrene for which separation is difficult by distillation are<br>
present among the polar substances such as aldehydes and ketones produced as<br>
by-products during phenol production. Thus, polar substances end up contaminating<br>
the a-methylstyrene in the form of impurities in the case of distillative purification<br>
alone.<br>
[0018]<br>
In addition, a method is carried out for the purpose of removing impurities<br>
containing polar substances comprises supplying crude a-methylstyrene to an<br>
alkaline washing tank prior to distillation and washing in the tank followed by supplying<br>
to a distillation column to recover the product a-methylstyrene (see, for example.<br>
Patent Documents 5 and 6). However, in the case of washing in an alkaline washing<br>
tank according to the above method, since the solubility of polar substances in<br>
alkaline solution is inadequate, the polar substances end up remaining in the<br>
a-methylstyrene, thereby preventing the removal of trace amounts of polar<br>
substances. In addition, although methods have also been considered involving<br>
reacting polar substances in an alkaline washing tank to obtain lowly volatile<br>
substances and increasing the difference in relative volatility between these<br>
substances and a-methylstyrene followed by distillation, in this case, polar substances<br>
cannot be removed unless the reaction is allowed to proceed to nearly 100%.<br>
[0019]<br>
On the other hand, an example of a typical method for purifying polymerization<br>
monomers in the form of styrenes in the laboratory may include washing with an<br>
alkaline substance such as an aqueous sodium thiosulfate solution or aqueous<br>
sodium hydroxide solution and water followed by drying and distillation (see, for<br>
example, Non-Patent Document 2). However, although the above method makes it<br>
8<br><br>
possible to eliminate the use of a polymerization inhibitor, peroxide and polymer, polar<br>
substances cannot be completely removed from a-methylstyrene for the same<br>
reasons as in the case of washing in an alkaline washing tank as described above.<br>
[0020]<br>
In addition, although a method has indicated including adding alkyl lithium and<br>
the like to monomers prior to polymerization to deactivate polar substances followed<br>
by distillation, in this case, since considerable amounts of polymers, oligomers and<br>
the like are formed accompanying the reaction, this method is not considered to be<br>
industrially suitable. In addition, the monomers may become contaminated with<br>
oligomers depending on the distillation conditions, thereby having the potential for<br>
having a detrimental effect on polymerization<br>
[0021]<br>
Another example of a method for purifying a-methylstyrene may include<br>
purification using a column packed with silica gel, alumina or ion exchange resin and<br>
the like (see, for example, Patent Document 2 and Non-Patent Document 3)<br>
However, these packing materials usually contain acidic or basic components.<br>
Namely, in the above method, there is a possibility of an acidic component present in<br>
the packing material causing the formation of low molecular weight oligomers of<br>
a-methylstyrene, or a basic component present in the packing material causing<br>
deterioration of polar substances to high molecular weight condensates. The formed<br>
oligomers or high molecular weight condensates contaminate the monomers in the<br>
column, and if polymerization is carried out using these contaminated monomers,<br>
there is a risk of polymerization being interrupted or the reaction being impaired in<br>
other ways. Moreover, since these oligomers and high molecular weight<br>
condensates have low volatility, they are unable to be removed from the polymerized<br>
polymer solution, and end up contaminating the final product polymer As a result,<br>
9<br><br>
problems occur leading to deterioration of polymer performance in the form of a<br>
decrease in the heat resistance of the product polymer or yellowing.<br>
[0022]<br>
As has been described above, none of the methods of the prior art are able to<br>
be effectively used industrially as a method for purifying α-methylstyrene.<br>

Problems to be Solved by the Invention<br>
[0023]<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a method for purifying<br>
a-methylstyrene allowing the obtaining of highly pure a-methylstyrene containing<br>
hardly any polar substances by efficiently removing polar substances contained in<br>
trace amounts in a-methylstyrene in a method for purifying a-methylstyrene.<br>

Means for Solving the Problems<br>
[0024]<br>

control of polymerization, and that oligomers formed in conventional purification<br>
methods also cause polymer coloring and decreases in physical properties. In order<br>
to eliminate these problems, the inventors of the present invention found that a<br>
method for purifying a-methylstyrene is able to efficiently remove polar substances<br>
without forming oligomers by employing a method for removing these polar<br>
substances so as to control the content of polar substances and oligomers within a<br>
fixed range by reacting polar substances contained in a-methylstyrene in the<br>
presence of a basic substance and then separating low boiling point by-products<br>
formed by this reaction from reaction products of the polar substances, thereby<br>
leading to completion of the present invention<br>

purifying a-methylstyrene, a-methylstyrene for living anionic polymerization, and a<br>

Advantageous Effects of the Invention<br>
[0036]<br>
The present invention is useful as a method for obtaining a highly pure<br>
α-methylstyrene for anionic polymerization without requiring a complex process<br>
capable of removing by distillation trace amounts of polar substances, generally<br>
unable to be removed by distillation, by efficiently modifying to high molecular weight<br>
condensates by reacting a polar substance in a-methylstyrene in the presence of a<br>
basic substance and separating from low boiling point reaction by-products. In<br>
addition, use of an a-methylstyrene purified by the purification method of the present<br>
invention makes it possible to obtain a copolymer containing a styrene-based<br>
copolymer that improves heat resistance and weather resistance, which were the<br><br>
disadvantages of SMAA and SMA, and also has superior melt stability, moldability,<br>
strength, rigidity and recyclability while preventing polymer coloring and retaining the<br>
superior properties of conventional styrene-based resins in the form of transparency,<br>
dimensional stability and molding processability.<br>
Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
[0037]<br>
The following provides a detailed explanation of the present invention.<br>
Examples of polar substances present in α-methylstyrene to be removed by the<br>
purification method of the present invention may include carbonyl group-containing<br>
compounds, phenol and mixtures of catechols containing polymerization inhibitors in<br>
the form of -butylcatechol. Specific examples of polar substances in the form of<br>
carbonyl group-containing compounds may include aliphatic carbonyl compounds in<br>
the form of compound represented by the following general formula (1) and aromatic<br>
carbonyl compounds in the form of compounds represented by the following general<br>
formula (2):<br><br>
(wherein each of R1, R3 and R4 independently represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl<br>
16<br><br>
group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, and R2 represents an alkyl group having 1 to 6<br>
carbon atoms).<br>
[0041]<br>
The term "alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms" used in the present<br>
specification refers to a linear or branched alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms,<br>
specific examples of which may include a methyl group, an ethyl group, a n-propyl<br>
group, an isopropyl group, a n-butyl group, an isobutyl group, a sec-butyl group, a<br>
tert-butyl group, a n-pentyl group, a 1,1-dimethylpropyl group, a 1,2-dimethylpropyl<br>
group, a 2,2-dimethylpropyl group, a 1-ethylpropyl group, a n-hexyl group, a<br>
1-ethyl-2-methylpropyl group, a 1,1,2-trimethylpropyl group, a 1-ethylbutyl group, a<br>
1-methylbutyl group, a 2-methylbutyl group, a 1,1-dimethylbutyl group, a<br>
1,2-dimethylbutyl group, a 2,2-dimethylbutyl group, a 1,3-dimethylbutyl group, a<br>
2,3-dimethylbutyl group, a 2-ethylbutyl group, a 2-methylpentyl group, a<br>
3-methylpentyl group and the like. Preferable examples may include a methyl group,<br>
an ethyl group, a n-propyl group, an isopropyl group, a n-butyl group, an isobutyl<br>
group, a sec-butyl group, a tert-butyl group, a n-pentyl group, a n-hexyl group and the<br>
like.<br>
[0042]<br>
In the present invention, more specific examples of the carbonyl<br>
group-containing	compounds	may	include	acetonylacetone.<br>
3-methyl-2-cyclopentenone, benzaldehyde, acetophenone and the like. Since these<br>
polar substances inhibit polymerization or cause polymer coloring during production of<br>
poly-α-methylstyrene and copolymers thereof by anionic polymerization and the like,<br>
they are preferably removed as much as possible. Since polar substances other<br>
than water such as t-butylcatechol, acetonylacetone, 3-methyl-2-cyclopentenone,<br>
benzaldehyde and acetophenone have boiling points close to that of a-methylstyrene,<br>
17<br><br>
they cannot be reduced beyond a certain level by the ordinary distillation.<br>
[0043]<br>
The inventors of the present invention made it possible to remove trace amounts<br>
of these polar substances, which are unable to be removed by the ordinary distillation,<br>
by distillation by reacting in the presence of specific basic substances, and efficiently<br>
converting the polar substances that reacted in the presence of the basic substance to<br>
high boiling point compounds to increase the difference in relative volatility with that of<br>
α-methylstyrene. Moreover, the inventors of the present invention also found a<br>
method for obtaining highly pure a-methylstyrene by separating reaction products of<br>
the polar substance from a-methylstyrene and low boiling point components<br>
containing side reaction products, followed by further separating a-methylstyrene from<br>
the low boiling point components.<br>
[0044]<br>
In the present invention, there are two possible reactions for obtaining high<br>
boiling point compounds by reacting the polar substances in the presence of a basic<br>
substance. The first method involves a reaction for obtaining a high boiling point<br>
compound by reacting phenol or catechols having an active hydrogen with base to<br>
form a salt, while the other method involves a reeiction for increasing molecular weight<br>
by causing an aldehyde or ketone having one or more hydrogen atoms at the a<br>
position to undergo an intramolecular or intermolecular condensation reaction in the<br>
presence of a basic substance. In the case of the latter reaction in particular, since<br>
water or alcohol is produced by condensation as will be described to follow, and when<br>
considering that the reaction is an equilibrium reaction, it is extremely difficult to allow<br>
the reaction to proceed and increase molecular weight since the concentration of the<br>
reactants is extremely low.<br>
[0045]<br>
18<br><br>
In addition, although there are compounds that undergo an intermolecular<br>
reaction depending on the particular compound, in this case, since the boiling point is<br>
extremely close to that of the original polar substance, the compounds cannot be<br>
separated by distillation. The inventors of the present invention found that boiling<br>
point can be increased by converting these intermolecular condensation compounds<br>
to intermolecular compounds by treating under specific conditions.<br>
[0046]<br>
Examples of aldehydes and ketones having a hydrogen atom at the a position<br>
may include acetonylacetone, 3-methyl-2-cyclopentenone and acetophenone. In the<br>
first stage, a basic substance removes the hydrogen atom at the a position resulting in<br>
the formation of an enolate and polar substance. Since this reaction is an equilibrium<br>
reaction and the equilibrium is generally biased toward the reactants side, it is difficult<br>
to form an enolate. Subsequently, in the second stage, the formed enolate<br>
undergoes an intermolecular addition reaction with the polar substance. As a result,<br>
since two or more polar substances increase in molecular weight and the difference in<br>
relative volatility with a-methylstyrene increases, they can be separated by distillation.<br>
A polar substance to which an enolate has been added may or may not have a<br>
hydrogen atom at the a position, and even benzaldehyde, which does not have a<br>
hydrogen atom at the a position, can be increased in molecular weight.<br>
[0047]<br>
In particular, it is important in the present invention that the enolate formation of<br>
the first stage is carried out efficiently in order to carry out a condensation reaction at a<br>
trace concentration that generally proceeds with difficulty. Consequently, low boiling<br>
point by-products such as water and alcohol produced by the condensation reaction<br>
are discharged from the reaction system during the condensation reaction in the<br>
presence of a basic substance. As a result of discharging low boiling point<br>
19<br><br>
by-products from the reaction system, the first stage equilibrium reaction is shifted<br>
toward the enolate formation side, thereby allowing the condensation reaction to<br>
proceed efficiently and making it possible to recover highly pure a-methylstyrene.<br>
Low boiling point by-products at this time indicate those having a boiling point lower<br>
than that of a-methylstyrene. Discharge of low boiling point by-products from the<br>
reaction system may be carried out continuously or sequentially within the reaction<br>
system.<br>
[0048]<br>
The separation is only required to be that which separates low boiling point<br>
by-products from the reaction system, and typically consists of vaporizing the low<br>
boiling point by-products by heating the reaction system to a temperature equal to or<br>
higher than the boiling point of the low boiling point by-products in the manner of<br>
distillation. Examples of methods for discharging low boiling point by-products from<br>
the reaction system may include a method in which low boiling point by-products are<br>
separated from the reaction system, and the remaining a-methylstyrene and polar<br>
substance reaction product is separated by a method such as distillation; a method in<br>
which a mixture of a-methylstyrene and low boiling point by-products is discharged<br>
from the reaction system while at the same time separating the a-methylstyrene from<br>
the low boiling point by-products by distillation; and a method in which a mixture of<br>
a-methylstyrene and low boiling point by-products is separated from the reaction<br>
system followed by separating the a-methylstyrene and low boiling point by-products<br>
by distillation or adsorption using a column and the like. In the present invention, any<br>
of these methods may be used. What is important herein is that low boiling point<br>
by-products be efficiently removed from the reaction system, and that the<br>
condensation reaction be allowed to proceed efficiently as a result thereof.<br>
[0049]<br>
2 0<br><br>
There are no particular limitations on the basic substance used in the present<br>
invention provided it has basicity to a degree that enables it to remove a hydrogen<br>
atom at the a position of the polar substances. As an indicator of basicity, the pKa of<br>
the conjugate acid thereof is preferably 10 or more. Examples of basic substances<br>
that can be used may include those containing alkaline metals or alkaline earth metals<br>
including metal alkoxides such as sodium ethoxide, potassium ethoxide (conjugate<br>
acid: ethanol, pKa: 17) or sodium methoxide (conjugate acid: methanol, pKa: 16),<br>
metal hydroxides (conjugate acid: water, pKa: 16) such as sodium hydroxide,<br>
potassium hydroxide or magnesium hydroxide, metal oxides (conjugate acid: water,<br>
pKa: 16) such as sodium oxide, potassium oxide or magnesium oxide, metal amides<br>
such as sodium amide (conjugate acid: ammonia, pKa: 35) or lithium<br>
diisopropylamide (conjugate acid: diisopropylamine, pKa: 36), and alkyl metals such<br>
as butyl lithium (conjugate acid: butane, pKa: 45) or methyl lithium (conjugate acid:<br>
methane, pKa; 40).<br>
[0050]<br>
These basic substances preferably have high solubility and dispersibility in<br>
α-methylstyrene. Although basic substances having high solubility and dispersibility<br>
in a-methylstyrene can be used as is, there are cases in which they are preferably<br>
used in the form of a solution by using a suitable solvent. In this case, there are no<br>
particular limitations on the solvent that composes the basic substance provided it has<br>
the ability to dissolve the basic substance, and water, alcohol or a mixed solution<br>
thereof, for example, can be used.<br>
[0051]<br>
In this case, although water and alcohol inhibit the condensation reaction,<br>
following dispersion of a basic substance, this does not cause a problem provided that<br>
the water and alcohol are able to be discharged outside the reaction system along<br>
21<br><br>
with low boiling point by-products. Thus, alcohols preferably have a boiling point at<br>
least lower than a-methylstyrene.<br>
[0052]<br>
The concentration of the basic substance is preferably from 0.01 to 10% by<br>
weight and more preferably from 0.02 to 5% by weight based on a-methylstyrene.<br>
Although depending on the concentration of the basic substance, there are no<br>
particular limitations on the reaction time provided it is of a sufficient duration to allow<br>
the condensation reaction to proceed, and it is preferable to allow a certain amount of<br>
time for conversion to high boiling point intermolecular condensation products.<br>
Although reaction time is represented as the mean retention time in the case of a<br>
continuous reaction system or as the sum of the reaction time and distillation rate in<br>
the case of a batch reaction system, in the case of a basic substance at the<br>
concentrations indicated above, a preferable reaction time is at least 15 minutes,<br>
more preferably from 15 minutes to 4 hours and even more preferably from 30<br>
minutes to 3 hours.<br>
[0053]<br>
Any form of reaction system may be used in the present invention provided it<br>
allows the air-liquid equilibrium within the system to be substantially maintained. The<br>
operating pressure can be arbitrarily selected from within the range of atmospheric<br>
pressure to 5 kg/cm2. In addition, there are also no particular problems even if the<br>
procedure is carried out under a reduced pressure. Although the temperature within<br>
the reaction system can be arbitrarily set according to the pressure, it is preferably<br>
from 40 to 200°C and more preferably from 60 to 150°C. The ceiling temperature is<br>
60°C or higher in consideration of inhibiting polymerization of cx-methylstyrene and<br>
150°C or lower in consideration of energy conservation of the heat source.<br>
[0054]<br>
22<br><br>
There are no particular limitations on the form in which α-methylstyrene and the<br>
basic substance are supplied provided low boiling point by-products such as water<br>
and alcohol produced by condensation can be sequentially removed, and they may be<br>
supplied by a batch operation or continuous operation<br>
[0055]<br>
The a-methylstyrene obtained according to the purification method of the<br>
present invention can be removed of impurities in the form of polar substances such<br>
as phenol, t-butylcatechol, acetonylacetone, 3-methyl-2-cyclopentenone or<br>
benzaldehyde and controlled to within a fixed range. Controlling these polar<br>
substances to within a fixed range is extremely effective for controlling polymerization<br>
and preventing polymer yellowing.<br>
[0056]<br>
Although the lower the amount of polar substances the better, the total amount<br>
of acetonylacetone and its intramolecular condensation product in the form of<br>
3-methyl-2-cyclopentenone is preferably 100 ppm by weight or less and more<br>
preferably 50 ppm by weight or less, and the amount of benzaldehyde is preferably 30<br>
ppm by weight or less and more preferably 20 ppm by weight or less. If the total<br>
amount of acetonylacetone and its intramolecular condensation product in the form of<br>
3-methyl-2-pentenone exceeds 100 ppm by weight or the amount of benzaldehyde<br>
exceeds 30 ppm by weight, yellowing of the resulting polymer becomes prominent,<br>
and living polymerization may be inhibited depending on the case.<br>
[0057]<br>
The following provides a description of a styrene-based copolymer of a<br>
component that composes the heat-resistant styrene-based copolymer according to<br>
the present invention. A heat-resistant styrene-based copolymer in the present<br>

like. Preferable examples may include a methoxy group, an ethoxy group, a<br>
n-propoxy group, an isopropoxy group and the like, and even more preferable<br>
examples may include a methoxy group and an ethoxy group.<br>
[0061]<br>
The term "alkyl group having 2 or more carbon atoms" used in the present<br>
specification refers to a linear or branched alkyl group having 2 to 6 carbon atoms,<br>
specific examples of which may include an ethyl group, a n-propyl group, an isopropyl<br>

[0062]<br>

atom, a chlorine atom, a bromine atom or an iodine atom.<br>
[0063]<br>
The term "haloalkyi group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms" used in the present<br>
specification refers to a group in which a previously defined "halogen atom" is bonded<br>
to a previously defined "alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms".<br>
[0064]<br>
25<br><br>
A vinyl aromatic monomer as used in the present description refers to, for<br>
example, styrene; an alkyl-substituted styrene such as p-methylstyrene,<br>
m-methylstyrene, o-methylstyrene, 2,4-dimethylstyrene, 2,5-dimethylstyrene,<br>
3,4-dimethylstyrene, 3,5-dimethylstyrene, p-ethylstyrene, m-ethylstyrene or<br>
o-ethylstyrene; or other styrene derivative such as p-hydroxystyrene,<br>
p-methoxystyrene, p-chlorostyrene or 1,1-diphenylethylene. A preferable vinyl<br>
aromatic monomer is styrene. One type each of the a-methylstyrene and vinyl<br>
aromatic monomer may be used, or a mixture of two or more types may be used. In<br>
the present invention, the most preferable combination is the combination of styrene<br>
and a-methylstyrene obtained by purifying according to the purification method of the<br>
present invention.<br>
[0065]<br>
The content of the a-methylstyrene unit in the styrene-based copolymer is from<br>
5 to 70% by weight, preferably from 7 to 68% by weight and more preferably from 10<br>
to 65% by weight. If the content of the a-methylstyrene unit is lower than 5% by<br>
weight, practical effects for improving heat resistance are virtually not observed. On<br>
the other hand, if the content of the a-methylstyrene unit exceeds 70% by weight,<br>
there is increased susceptibility to thermal decomposition during melting and molding<br>
while also increasing the amount of gas generated during molding. In addition, the<br>
amount of monomer components in the resin increase accompanying decomposition,<br>
thereby resulting in increased in the occurrence of bleedout on the surface of molded<br>
articles.<br>
[0066]<br>
Other polymerizable monomers can be used in addition to the monomers<br>
described above within a range that does not impair the object of the present invention<br>
Examples of other polymerizable monomers may include conjugated diene monomers<br>
2 6<br><br>
such as butadiene or isoprene; methacrylic acid alky! esters such as methyl<br>
methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate, propyl methacrylate or butyl methacrylate; and<br>
acrylic acid esters such as methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, propyl acrylate or butyl<br>
acrylate. These monomers are useful in the case of improving or adjusting impact<br>
strength, elongation or chemical resistance and the like of the resin.<br>
10067]<br>
The styrene-based copolymer in the present invention is synthesized by living<br>
anionic polymerization. A known method can be used to carry out living anionic<br>
polymerization. For example, an organic lithium compound is used for the initiator,<br>
specific examples of which may include n-butyl lithium, sec-butyl lithium, t-butyl lithium,<br>
ethyl lithium, benzyl lithium, 1,6-dilithiohexane, styryl lithium, butadienyl lithium and<br>
the like. Preferable examples may include n-butyl lithium and sec-butyl lithium.<br>
[0068]<br>
A hydrocarbon-based compound not containing a hetero atom is preferable for<br>
the polymerization solvent, specific examples of which may include aliphatic<br>
hydrocarbon compounds such as n-hexane, cyclohexane or heptane, and aromatic<br>
hydrocarbon compounds such as benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene or xylene. One<br>
type or two or more types of these hydrocarbon compounds may be used. A<br>
particularly preferable compound is cyclohexane.<br>
[0069]<br>
In addition, in the present invention, benzofuran may be added for the purpose<br>
of controlling polymerization. The inventors of the present invention found that the<br>
polymerization efficiency of a-methylstyrene can be improved dramatically by<br>
containing benzofuran in the living anionic polymerization system of the monomer<br>
containing a-methylstyrene.<br>
[0070]<br>
27<br><br>
In general, in styrene and conjugated diene living anionic polymerization<br>
systems, an ether compound such as tetrahydrofuran is known to be added for the<br>
purpose of improving the polymerization rate and promoting randomization during<br>
copolymerization. However, since tetrahydrofuran, for example, easily reacts with<br>
lithium compounds frequently used as initiators of living anionic polymerization<br>
systems depending on the polymerization temperature, there was the problem of<br>
decreasing initiator efficiency as a result of acting as an inhibitor.<br>
[0071]<br>
On the other hand, the benzofuran used in the present invention contributes to<br>
increasing the polymerization rate and monomer reactivity without causing the above<br>
problems, and effectively acts to produce a heat-resistance styrene-based copolymer<br>
of a high molecular weight polymer. In the present invention, benzofuran is added to<br>
a-methylstyrene in an amount of from 5 to 5000 ppm, preferably from 10 to 4800 ppm<br>
and more preferably from 20 to 4500 ppm. If the added amount is lower than 5 ppm,<br>
the effect on the growing polymer species decreases. Namely, the effects on<br>
polymerization rate and polymerization conversion rate decrease thereby preventing<br>
the object of the present invention from being attained. Even if benzofuran is present<br>
in excess of 5000 ppm, no significant changes are observed in polymerization rate or<br>
conversion rate. In addition, since benzofuran is yellow in color, characteristic<br>
yellowing of the benzofuran becomes conspicuous during pelletization following<br>
removal of unreacted monomer and solvent, thereby making this undesirable<br>
depending on the application.<br>
[0072]<br>
Benzofuran is not required to be added and mixed into the a-methylstyrene prior<br>
to polymerization, and may be mixed with other monomers and solvents.<br>
[0073]<br>
2 8<br><br>
The polymerization temperature is preferably within the range of from 40 to<br>
110°C, more preferably within a range of from 50 to 100°C and even more preferably<br>
within a range of from 55 to 95°C. If the polymerization temperature is lower than<br>
40°C, the reaction rate decreases thereby making the process impractical for<br>
industrial production. In addition, if the polymerization temperature is higher than<br>
110°C, yellowing of the copolymer becomes conspicuous while also causing<br>
decreases in weather resistance and thermal stability of the copolymer during melting.<br>
[0074]<br>
The styrene-based copolymer according to the present invention can be<br>
produced by, for example, continuous living polymerization using a complex mixing<br>
type of polymerization reactor. Alternatively, a complete mixing type of<br>
polymerization reactor and non-complete mixing type of polymerization reactor may<br>
be combined. In order to obtain a random copolymer in particular, a complete mixing<br>
type of polymerization reactor is preferable. Complete mixing type polymerization<br>
refers to a method of polymerization that uses a continuous type of complete mixing<br>
reactor so that the concentrations of a-methylstyrene, vinyl aromatic monomer and<br>
living copolymer present in the living polymerization reaction system remain constant<br>
at all times.<br>
[0075]<br>
In the case of desiring to enhance productivity by increasing the monomer<br>
concentration in the raw material solution, it is desirable to attach a condenser to the<br>
polymerization reactor and remove heat of polymerization with the latent heat of<br>
evaporation of a solvent to efficiently carry out removal of heat from the<br>
polymerization reaction. If mainly cyclohexane (which may also contain n-hexane) is<br>
used for the polymerization solvent in particular, it becomes easy to control the<br>
polymerization temperature in the vicinity of from 80 to 90°C since the boiling point of<br>
2 9<br><br>
cyclohexane is 82°C.<br>
[0076]<br>
In the case of using a non-complete mixing type of tubular polymerization<br>
reactor, when it is difficult to obtain a completely mixed state within the polymerization<br>
reactor such as in the case the ratio (L/D) of the length (L) to the inner diameter (D) of<br>
the reactor is 1 or more or in the case of poor stirring efficiency, the styrene-based<br>
copolymer according to the present invention can be produced by adding a solution of<br>
vinyl aromatic monomer from a middle location in the reactor.<br>
[0077]<br>
In addition, the copolymer of the present invention can also be obtained by<br>
connecting two or more non-complete mixing type of polymerization reactors in series<br>
and adding a solution of vinyl aromatic monomer to the second polymerization reactor<br>
followed polymerization in the first polymerization reactor. Moreover, a block<br>
copolymer of a homopolymer and copolymer of the vinyl aromatic unit can be<br>
obtained by only polymerizing the vinyl aromatic monomer unit in the first<br>
polymerization reactor and then carrying out copolymerization of a-methylstyrene and<br>
the vinyl aromatic monomer unit in the second polymerization reactor.<br>
[0078]<br>
The value of the yellow index of the styrene-based copolymer according to the<br>
present invention is preferably 3 or less, more preferably 2 or less and even more<br>
preferably 1.5 or less. As was previously described, it is effective to reduce the<br>
content of polar substances in the a-methylstyrene purified by the purification method<br>
according to the present invention in order to lower the yellow index. During<br>
production of a biaxially oriented sheet (OPS) or foamed sheet (PSP) used in the field<br>
of food packaging in particular, there are cases in which yellowing of the resin<br>
becomes conspicuous causing problems in terms of quality as a result of recovering<br>
30<br><br>
the sheet by winding. Thus, users of these types of applications are particularly<br>
sensitive to resin yellowing, thus making this an important performance requirement.<br>
[0079]<br>
The ratio (Mz/Mw) of the Z-average molecular weight (Mz) to the weight average<br>
molecular weight (Mw) of the styrene-based copolymer containing a-methylstyrene<br>
purified by the purification method according to the present invention is within a range<br>
of from 1.4 to 3.0, preferably within a range of from 1.42 to 2.9 and even more<br>
preferably within a range of from 1.45 to 2.8. If the ratio of Mz/Mw is less than 1.4,<br>
the balance between fluidity and mechanical strength of the resin becomes poor<br>
resulting in the problem of making it difficult to increase the drawing ratio during biaxial<br>
orientation. In addition, if the ratio exceeds 3.0, the balance between fluidity and<br>
thermal decomposability becomes poor, thereby making it difficult to mold large<br>

Examples of methods for controlling the value of Mz/Mw may include a method<br>
in which the range of molecular weight distribution is increased by carrying out<br>
polymerization in a reactor in which polymerization times are distributed; and a<br>
method in which two or more types of copolymers having different molecular weights<br>
are multiply dispersed by melting or solution blending. Z-average molecular weight<br>
(Mz) and weight average molecular weight (Mw) can be determined by converting to<br>
polystyrene using gel permeation chromatography (GPC).<br>
[0081]<br>
Glass transition temperature in the present invention can be determined by DSC,<br>
and the temperature determined according to the method indicated in JIS-K7121 is<br>
used for the glass transition temperature.<br>
[0082]<br>

Although there are no particular limitations on the bonding mode of the<br>
a-methylstyrene unit and vinyl aromatic monomer unit of the styrene-based<br>
copolymer according to the present invention, the most preferable bonding mode is a<br>
copolymer composed of random bonds. In general, susceptibility to thermal<br>
decomposition tends to increase the greater the number of chains of a-methylstyrene<br>
units present. Thus, depending on the application, it is preferable to control the<br>
number of chains of a-methylstyrene units to from 2 to 4 chains.<br>
[0083]<br>
Since there is no risk of the vinyl aromatic units impairing thermal stability even if<br>
in the form of chains, they may be in the form of a long chain structure. The<br>
inventors of the present invention found that if vinyl aromatic units are of the AB type,<br>
in which long chains of vinyl aromatic units are present on the end of the molecular<br>
chain of the copolymer or in the form of block copolymers of the ABA type (wherein A<br>
represents a homopolymer component composed mainly of vinyl aromatic unit<br>
components, while B represents a random copolymer component containing<br>
a-methylstyrene units and vinyl aromatic units), other performance including heat<br>
resistance, thermal stability, mechanical properties and fluidity is equal to that of<br>
random copolymers, and that compatibility with homopolymers composed of the same<br>
structure as a component of the blocks in the form of the vinyl aromatic units is<br>
extremely favorable. In the case of reusing the styrene-based copolymer according<br>
to the present invention as a recycling material by taking advantage of this<br>
characteristic, such as in the case of reusing by melting and kneading with<br>
polystyrene, a copolymer can be used in which polystyrene chains are blocked on the<br>
ends of the polymer chains of the copolymer.<br>
[0084]<br>
There are no particular limitations on the block chain length of the vinyl aromatic<br>
32<br><br>
units, and the number average molecular weight of a block chain portion may be<br>
within a range of from 1000 to 300,000. In addition, the ratio of Mw/Mn of a block<br>
portion composed of vinyl aromatic units is preferably within a range of from 10 to 3.5.<br>
[0085]<br>
The ratio of Mz/Mw of the Z-average molecular weight (Mz) to the weight<br>
average molecular weight (Mw) of a vinyl aromatic unit for the block component is<br>
required to be within a range of from 1.4 to 3.0, preferably within a range of from 1.42<br>
to 2.9 and more preferably within a range of from 1.45 to 2.8. If the ratio of Mz/Mw is<br>
less than 1.4, the balance between fluidity and mechanical properties of the resin<br>
becomes poor, thereby making it difficult to demonstrate adequate performance as a<br>
resin molded article. In addition, if the ratio of Mz'Mw exceeds 3.0, fluidity becomes<br>
poor, thereby making it difficult to mold large molded articles, thin-walled molded<br>
articles and the like.<br>
[0086]<br>
In a process for producing a copolymer having a vinyl aromatic unit for a block<br>
component, a homopolymer composed of vinyl aromatic units is produced with, for<br>
example, a batch-type reactor, a continuous tubular reactor, a continuous static mixer<br>
reactor, a continuous tank-type reactor with stirrer or a continuous coil-type reactor,<br>
followed by feeding a-methylstyrene, vinyl aromatic monomer and living homopolymer<br>
composed of vinyl aromatic units into a continuous complete mixing type of reactor<br>
and copolymerizing to obtain an AB type of block copolymer. In the case of obtaining<br>
an ABA type of block copolymer, vinyl aromatic units are subjected to living<br>
polymerization in a different reactor after having produced the AB type block<br>
copolymer. Alternatively, an ABA type of block copolymer can be obtained by adding<br>
a bifunctional compound that reacts with the growing living polymer species in a<br>
different reactor after having produced an AB type of living copolymer<br>
3 3<br><br>
[0087]<br>
As a result of further conducting extensive studies, the inventors of the present<br>
invention found that a styrene-based copolymer composed of at least two types of<br>
copolymers containing an a-methylstyrene unit and vinyl aromatic unit obtained by<br>
continuous living polymerization, and in which the composite ratio in the copolymers<br>
obtained by supplying to a polymerization reactor differs as a result of continuously or<br>
intermittently changing the composite ratio of a-methylstyrene and vinyl aromatic<br>
monomer represented by the formula (3) in the raw materials, demonstrates other<br>
performance including heat resistance, thermal stability, mechanical properties and<br>
fluidity equal to that of random copolymers, and compatibility with copolymers having<br>
a vinyl aromatic component as a main component thereof is extremely favorable.<br>
[0088]<br>
This suggests that, in the case of recycling molded articles of this copolymer,<br>
polymers composed mainly of vinyl aromatic units such as polystyrene can also be<br>
reused as recycling materials by blending. Different copolymers refer to copolymers<br>
in which the glass transition temperature thereof differs by at least 3°C.<br>
[0089]<br>
The supplying to a polymerization reactor by continuously or intermittently<br>
changing the composite ratio of a-methylstyrene and vinyl aromatic monomer among<br>
the monomers means that the concentration of each monomer introduced into the<br>
polymerization reaction system changes either continuously or intermittently and as a<br>
result, the composite ratio of each aromatic unit of the resulting copolymer changes<br>
resulting in the sequential acquisition of copolymers composed of at least two different<br>
composite ratios.<br>
[0090]<br>
Copolymers having two or more different composite ratios may be mixed in a<br>
34<br><br>
solution state in a batch-type tank followed by flushing into a tank heated in a vacuum<br>
to remove the solvent, or can be recovered in the form of pellets by removing the<br>
solvent using an extruder or kneader. Alternatively, they can also be recovered in the<br>
form of pellets directly without retaining in batch-type tank, and the pellets can then be<br>
mixed and made uniform in a batch-type or continuous mixing vessel Alternatively,<br>
after putting the pellets into a uniform state in a mixing vessel, the pellets can be<br>
further melted and mixed using an extruder.<br>
[0091]<br>
As a specific production example, after feeding a raw material having a<br>
composite ratio M1/M2 of α-methylstyrene (M1) to vinyl aromatic monomer (M2) of<br>
50/50 (wt%) into a reactor and polymerizing, feeding is switched over to a raw<br>
material having a different composite ratio, such as M1/M2 of 40/60 (wt%) which is<br>
also introduced into the reactor followed by carrying out polymerization. In this case,<br>
the raw material composition is said to change intermittently When polymerized in<br>
this manner, copolymers are sequentially obtained having compositions that<br>
continuously change from the composition of the copolymer obtained by polymerizing<br>
at an M1/M2 ratio of 50/50 (wt%) to the composition of the copolymer obtained by<br>
polymerizing at an M1/M2 ratio of 40/60 (wt%). The resulting copolymers are then<br>
mixed in solution or stirred and mixed in the form of pellets in a batch-type reactor<br>
followed by melting and kneading to obtain a copolymer having a certain fixed<br>
composition.<br>
[0092]<br>
Copolymers obtained according to such a method can be considered to have a<br>
copolymer composition in which the composite ratios of the a-methylstyrene unit and<br>
vinyl aromatic unit components differ. Copolymers obtained as a result thereof have<br>
extremely good compatibility with homopolymers of vinyl aromatic monomers, and<br>
35<br><br>
since they are able to maintain transparency without causing a decrease in<br>
mechanical properties, they were determined to be polymers having extremely high<br>
utilization value as recycling materials.<br>
[0093]<br>
In the living anionic polymerization serving as the production process of the<br>
copolymer of the present invention, completion of the polymerization reaction is<br>
preferably carried out in the case the reactivity of the vinyl aromatic monomer has<br>
reached 99% or more, and a-methylstyrene may remain in the reaction system.<br>
Termination of the polymerization reaction is carried out by addition of a reaction<br>
terminator in the form of a compound having an oxygen-hydrogen bond such as water,<br>
alcohol, phenol or carboxylic acid, and similar effects can also be expected for epoxy<br>
compounds, ester compounds, ketone compounds, carboxylic acid anhydrides and<br>
compounds having a carbon-halogen bond. The amount of these additives used is<br>
preferably about one to ten equivalents of the growing species. If the amount of<br>
these additives used is excessively large, not only is this disadvantageous in terms of<br>
costs, but there are many cases in which it impairs mixing of remaining additives.<br>
[0094]<br>
Polymer molecular weight can be increased and the polymer chain can be made<br>
to have a branched structure by carrying out a coupling reaction with a multifunctional<br>
compound using the growing living polymer species. A known compound can be<br>
selected for the multifunctional compound used in this type of coupling reaction.<br>
Examples of multifunctional compounds may include polyhalogen compounds,<br>
polyepoxy compounds, mono- or polycarboxylic acid esters, polyketone compounds,<br>
mono- or polycarboxylic acid anhydrides and the like. Specific examples may<br>
include silicon tetrachloride, di(trichlorosilyl)ethane, 1,3,5-tribromobenzene,<br>
epoxidated soybean oil, tetraglycidyl 1,3-bisaminomethylcyclohexane, dimethyl<br>
3 6<br><br>
oxalate, tri-2-ethylhexyl trimellitate, pyromellitic dianhydride, diethyl carbonate and the<br>
like.<br>
[0095]<br>
Following cx)mpletion of polymerization, unreacted monomer and solvent are<br>
removed by volatilization from the polymer for recovery and regeneration. A known<br>
method can be used for volatilization removal. A method involving flushing into a<br>
vacuum tank and / or a method involving heating to evaporation in a vacuum using an<br>
extruder or kneader can be preferably used for the volatilization removal apparatus.<br>
Although varying according to the volatility of the solvent, volatile components such as<br>
solvent and residual monomers are typically removed by volatilization at a<br>
temperature of from 180 to 300°C and degree of vacuum of from 100 Pa to 50 KPa.<br>
[0096]<br>
A method in which volatilization removal apparatuses are connected in series<br>
and arranged in two or more stages is also effective. In addition, a method can also<br>
be used in which water is added between the first stage and second stage to enhance<br>
the ability of the second stage to volatilize monomer. Moreover, after removing<br>
volatile components with a flushing tank, an extruder provided with a vent can be used<br>
to remove residual volatile components. The styrene-based copolymer that has<br>
been removed of solvent can be finished into pellets using a known method.<br>
[0097]<br>
Known compounds used in styrene-based resins can be added to the<br>
styrene-based copolymer according to the present invention for the purpose of<br>
improving thermal and mechanical stability fluidity and coloring as necessary<br>
Examples of such additives may include primary antioxidants in the form of<br>
2,4,6-tri-substituted phenols such as 2,6-di-t-butyl-4-methylphenol triethylene<br>
glycol-bis-[3-(3-t-butyl-5-methyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propionate],	pentaerythritol<br>
37<br><br>
tetraquis[-(3,5-di-t-butyl-4-hyclroxyphenyl) propionate], octadecyl-3-<br>
(3,5-di-t-butyl-4-hyclroxyphenyl)propionate, 1,3,5-trimethyl-2,4,6-tris(3,5,-di-t-butyl-4-<br>
hydroxybenzyl)benzene, n-octadecyl-3-(3,5-di-t-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propionate,<br>
2-t-butyl-6-(3-t-butyl-2-hydroxy-5-methylbenzyl)-4-methylphenyl	acrylate,<br>
2[1-(2-hydroxy-3,5-di-t-pentylphenyl)]-4,6-di-t-pentylphenyl	acrylate,<br>
tetraquis[methylene-3-(3,5-di-t-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propionate]	methane,<br>
3,9-bis[2-{3-(t-butyl-4-hydroxy-5-methylphenyl)propionylloxy}-1,1 -dimethylethyl]-<br>
2,4,8,10-tetraoxa[5,5]undecane,	1,3,5-tris(3',5'-di-t-butyl-4'-hydroxybenzyl)-s-<br>
triazine-2,4,6(1 H,2H,3H)-trione, 1,1,4-tris(2-methyl-4-hydroxy-5-t-butylphenyl) butane,<br>
4,4'-butylidenebis(3-methyl-6-t-butylphenol) and the like.<br>
[0098]<br>
In addition, phosphorous-based antioxidants or sulfur-based antioxidants can be<br>
added as secondary antioxidants, and hindered amine stabilizers or UV absorbers<br>
can be added as weather resistance agents. In addition, plasticizers such as mineral<br>
oils, lubricants such as long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids and / or metal salts<br>
thereof, coloring improvers such as organic dyes or organic pigments can also be<br>
added.<br>
[0099]<br>
Anthraquinone-based organic dyes for improving coloring are particularly<br>
preferable because of little impairment of thermal stability of the copolymer.<br>
Silicone-based and fluorine-based mold release agents, antistatic agents and<br>
other known technologies used in styrene-based resins can also be applied directly.<br>
These stabilizers can be added and mixed into a polymer solution following<br>
completion of polymerization, or they can be melted and mixed using an extruder<br>
following recovery of polymer.<br>
[0100]<br>
38<br><br>
The styrene-based copolymer according to the present invention is preferably<br>
suitable for injection molded articles. In particular, it can be used in structural<br>
materials and containers requiring transparency, heat resistance and high rigidity, as<br>
well as in molded articles and electric lighting covers requiring weather resistance.<br>

conditions of the present invention through examples thereof. Furthermore, the<br>
present invention is not limited by these examples.<br>
[0102]<br>
First, the following provides a description of evaluation methods used in the<br>
examples and comparative examples.<br><evaluation methods><br>
(1)	Solubility of Basic Substances in a-Methylstyrene<br>
The solubility of basic substances in a-methylstyrene was judged visually and<br>
evaluated based on the following criteria. In the case a basic substance is a solution,<br>
the state of a-methylstyrene in the reaction oven was observed after recovering the<br>
solvent of the basic substance in the form of an initial fraction.<br>

A: Slightly dispersed or suspended.<br>
x: Completely separated.<br>
[0103]<br>
(2)	a-Methylstyrene Purification Effects<br>
Polar substances contained in the recovered main fraction were quantified by<br>
gas chromatography (GC-14A, Shimadzu Corp.). The amount of polar substances<br>
39<br><br>
was taken to be the total amount of acetonylacetone, 3-methyl-2-cyclopetenone,<br>
benzaldehyde and acetophenone. The polar substance removal rate was<br>
determined based on the following formula 1.<br>
[0104]<br>
Removal rate (%) = Amount of reduction in polar substances (ppm) / Content of<br>
polar substances before purification (ppm) x 1 GO<br>
[0105]<br>

[0106]<br><production process><br>
[Production Example 1 ]<br>
(1)	Raw Materials<br>
After storing styrene (St: Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd.) and cydohexane (CH:<br>
Idemitsu Petrochemical Co., Ltd.) in a storage tank and bubbling with nitrogen, the<br>
solution was passed through a purification column packed with activated alumina<br>
(KHD-24, Sumika Alchem Co., Ltd.) having a volume of 5 liters to remove<br>
polymerization inhibitor in the form of t-butylcatechol.<br>
α-Methylstyrene (αMeSt: Mitsui Chemicals, Inc.) was purified under the<br>
conditions indicated in the subsequently described examples and comparative<br>
examples.<br>
(2)	initiator<br>
n-Butyl lithium (15 wt% n-hexane solution, Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.)<br>
was diluted with cydohexane by a factor of 1/61.<br>
40<br><br>
(3)	Terminator<br>
Methanol (analytical grade, Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) was diluted<br>
with cyclohexane to a concentration of 3 wt%.<br>
(4)	Polymerization Method<br>
A jacketed 5-liter reactor (R1) attached with a stirrer (Maxblend Impeller,<br>
Sumitomo Heavy Industries, Ltd.) and condenser and further equipped with a raw<br>
material feed nozzle, initiator feed nozzle and polymerization solution discharge<br>
nozzle was used for the polymerization reactor. The outlet of the condenser was<br>
sealed with nitrogen gas to prevent entrance of outside air. The volume of<br>
polymerization solution in the polymerization reactor was controlled to 3 liters at all<br>
times. A portion of the polymerization solution was continuously maintained in a<br>
boiling state and internal temperature was controlled to from 82 to 84°C. The<br>
rotating speed of the stirrer was 320 rpm. Gear pumps were respectively attached to<br>
the raw material inlet and outlet of the polymerization reactor, and the polymerization<br>
solution was controlled so that a solution mixed at a ratio of St/aMeSt/CH of 10/21/69<br>
(wt%) was allowed to flow at a constant flow rate of 1.5 L/Hr In addition, the initiator<br>
was introduced into the polymerization reactor at 0.07 L/Hr.<br>
The living polymer solution discharged from the polymerization reactor was<br>
further led to the inlet of the polymerization terminator solution through a pipe having a<br>
diameter of 10 mm with a gear pump. The length of pipe from the reactor to the<br>
location of mixing with the polymerization terminator was about 2 m, and the pipe was<br>
maintained at a temperature of 65 to 70°C. The terminator solution was introduced<br>
into the polymerization reaction solution at a flow rate of 0.1 L/Hr, and subsequently<br>
terminated the polymerization reaction after passing through a static mixer having a<br>
volume of 1.2 liters (Model SMX, Sulzer Corp.). Moreover, the polymer solution was<br>
heated to 260°C with a preheater and then flushed into an approximately 50 L reactor<br>
41<br><br>
heated to a set temperature of 260°C under a reduced pressure of 60 torr followed by<br>
separation and recovery of solvent and unreacted monomer from the polymer. The<br>
temperature of the polymer in the flushing container was about 240 to 250°C, and the<br>
retention time of the polymer in the tank was about 20 to 30 minutes. After being<br>
adequate removed of volatile components, the polymer was subsequently discharged<br>
in the form of a rope, cooled with water and then palletized with a cutter to recover<br>
styrene-based copolymer.<br>
[0107]<br>
[Production Example 2]<br>
A styrene-based copolymer was obtained by polymerizing under the same<br>
conditions and using the same method as Production Example 1 with the exception<br>
making the flow rate of initiator solution into the polymerization reactor 0 16 L/Hr.<br>
[0108]<br><analytical methods><br>
(1)	Measurement of Molecular Weight (Mn, Mw, Mz, Mz/Mw)<br>
Molecular weights were measured with a GPC system consisting of connecting<br>
two columns (TSKgel SuperHZM-H, 40°C) to the HLC-8220 manufactured by Toray<br>
Industries, Inc. and provided with an Rl detector THF was used for the mobile<br>
phase. Calculation of molecular weights was carried out by preparing calibration<br>
curves using polystyrene standards (Toray Industries, Inc) and then converting as<br>
polystyrene.<br>
(2)	Measurement of Polymerization Rates<br>
Samples of polymer solution were collected after terminating polymerization<br>
followed by quantification of the amounts of styrene monomer and α-methylstyrene<br>
remaining in the solution by gas chromatography (GC-14B, Shimadzu Corp ). Each<br>
polymerization rate was determined based on formula (a) below.<br>
42<br><br>
Formula (a):<br>
Polymerization rate (%) = (1-(monomer concentration remaining in polymer<br>
solution after polymerization / monomer concentration in raw material<br>
solution before polymerization)) x 100<br>
[0109]<br><molding method><br>
Molding was carried out under the following conditions using an injection<br>
molding machine manufactured by Funac, Ltd. (AUTO SHOT 15A). The cylinder<br>
temperatures were set to be 215°C, 225°C, 230°C and 230°C moving from the hopper<br>
side. The mold temperature was set to be 60°C, injection time to be 10 seconds and<br>
cooling time to be 20 seconds. Molten resin was filled by applying pressure 5 MPa<br>
higher than the injection pressure at which resin is filled into the mold. An ASTM No<br>
4 dumbbell having a thickness of 3 mm was molded and used as the sample for<br>
measurement of yellow index.<br>
[0110]<br><evaluation methods><br>
(1)	Evaluation of Polar Substance Content of a-Methylstyrene<br>
Polar substances contained in sampled a-methylstyrene were quantified by gas<br>
chromatography (GC-1700, Shimadzu Corp.). The temperature of the column<br>
(HR-20, manufactured by Shinwa Chemical Industries, Ltd.) was held at 110°C for 10<br>
minutes and then raised to 160°C at the rate of 5oC/min and then further raised to<br>
230°C at the rate of 20°C/min followed by measurement<br>
[0111]<br>
(2)	Evaluation of Dimer Content of a-Methylstyrene<br>
Polar substances contained in the sampled a-methylstyrene were quantified by<br>
gas chromatography (GC-1700, Shimadzu Corp.). Measurement was carried out<br>
43<br><br>
under the following conditions.<br>
Column: HR-1 (0.32 mm x 30 m x 0.25 μm), non-polar<br>
Carrier gas; He(1 ml/min, split ratio; 1;10)<br>
Column temperature; 200°C → (3°C/min) → 290X (40°C/min) → 300°C (held<br>
for 20 minutes)<br>
Sample injection port temperature: 250°C<br>
Detector temperature: 280°C<br>
[0112]<br>
(3)	Evaluation of Living Index<br>
Living index is an indicator that expresses the closeness to ideal living<br>
polymerization. In the case of ideal living polymerization, since the concentration of<br>
the active species does not change before and after polymerization, the number<br>
average molecular weight (Mn) as calculated from the resulting polymer is<br>
represented with the following formula (b).<br>
Formula (b):<br>
Ideal Mn = Weight of all reacted monomers (g) / total amount of initiator (mol)<br>
The living index is taken to be the difference between the above ideal Mn and the Mn<br>
of the polymer actually obtained, is determined based on the following formula (c),<br>
and is defined as indicated below.<br>
Formula (c):<br>
Living index = Ideal Mn/Mn of resulting polymer<br>
O; Living index of greater than 0.8 to 1.2.<br>
∆; Living index of greater than 0.7 to 0.8 or greater than 1.2 to 1.3.<br>
X; Living index of 0.7 or less or greater than 1.3<br>
[0113]<br>
(4)	Glass Transition Temperature (Tg)<br>
44<br><br>
Glass transition temperature (Tg) was determined in compliance with<br>
JIS-K-7121 using the DSC~7 manufactured by Perkin-Elmer Corp. More specifically,<br>
the temperature was raised to 250°C at the rate of 10°C/min, returned to room<br>
temperature at the rate of 10°C/min and again raised to 250°C at the rate of 10°C/min<br>
in the presence of nitrogen. The glass transition temperature measured during the<br>
course of the second temperature rise was used as the value of Tg.<br>
[0114]<br>
(5) Yellow Index<br>
Yellow index was measured in accordance with JIS-K7103 using the<br>
SM-5-CH-H2 manufactured by Suga Test Instruments Co., Ltd.<br>
O: Yellow index of 1.5 or lower.<br>
O: Yellow index of greater than 1.5 to 2.0<br>
∆: Yellow index of greater than 2.0 to 3.0.<br>
X; Yellow index of 3.0 or more.<br>
[0115]<br>
[Example 1]<br>
Distillation was carried out by simple distillation. More specifically, a<br>
thermometer for measuring liquid temperature was attached to a 300 ml reaction flask<br>
containing a rotor, and a K-tube attached with a thermometer for measuring water<br>
vapor temperature, a Liebig condenser, a two-way adapter and a holding flask were<br>
attached thereto. Moreover, a vacuum pump was connected to the adapter through<br>
a vacuum controller (VC-30S, Okano Works, Ltd.) to enable adjustment of the degree<br>
of decompression. An oil bath was used for the heat source.<br>
200 ml of a-methylstyrene (Mitsui Chemicals, Inc.) were placed in the reaction<br>
flask and the liquid temperature was raised to be 80°C. Subsequently, a basic<br>
substance in the form of 0.08% by weight of sodium ethoxide (20% by weight ethanol<br>
45<br><br>
solution, Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd ) was added to the reaction flask while<br>
stirring with the rotor. The degree of decompression was adjusted to 230 mmHg and<br>
the liquid temperature was slowly raised to be from 120 to 125"C.<br>
A low boiling point fraction that condensed after reached a boiling point during<br>
heating was recovered as an initial fraction.<br>
The main fraction was recovered when the liquid temperature reached 120 to<br>
125°C and the water vapor temperature also reached 120 to 125°C. The contents of<br>
phenol and t-butylcatechol in the purified a-methylstyrene were below the detection<br>
limit (2 ppm by weight).<br>
[0116]<br>
[Example 2]<br>
Example 2 was carried out in the same manner as Example 1 with the exception<br>
of making the added amount of sodium ethoxide (20% by weight ethanoi solution<br>
Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) 0.4% by weight. The contents of phenol and<br>
t-butylcatechol in the purified a-methylstyrene were below the detection limit (2 ppm<br>
by weight).<br>
[0117]<br>
[Example 3]<br>
A thermometer for measuring liquid temperature was attached to a 160 ml<br>
5-mouth reaction flask containing a rotor, and a K-tube attached with a thermometer<br>
for measuring water vapor temperature, a Liebig condenser, a two-way adapter and a<br>
holding flask were attached thereto. Moreover, a vacuum pump was connected to<br>
the adapter through a vacuum controller (\/C-30S, Okano Works, Ltd) to enable<br>
adjustment of the degree of decompression. Moreover, a-methylstyrene was fed into<br>
the flask at the rate of 1.99 ml/min through a pump A. In addition, sodium ethoxide<br>
(20% by weight ethanoi solution, Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) was fed into<br>
46<br><br>
the flask at the rate of 0.008 ml/min through a microfeeder (pump B). The liquid<br>
inside the flask was discharged at the rate of 0.1 ml/min using a pump C. The<br>
pressure inside the system was maintained at 230 mmHg and distillation was carried<br>
out at the rate of 1.9 ml/min. An oil bath was used for the heat source. Once<br>
conditions had stabilized, the distilled monomer liquid was analyzed. The contents of<br>
phenol and t-butylcatechol in the purified a-methylstyrene were below the detection<br>
limit (2 ppm by weight).<br>
[0118]<br>
[Example 4]<br>
Example 4 was carried out in the same manner as Example 2 with the exception<br>
of using sodium hydroxide (50% by weight aqueous solution, Wako Pure Chemical<br>
