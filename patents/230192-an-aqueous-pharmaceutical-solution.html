				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a stable aqueous solution comprising oxy-<br>
metazoline and/or xylometazoline, a zinc salt and a buffer salt. The aque-<br>
ous solution is particularly suitable for local administration into the nose for<br>
decongesting the mucous membrane.<br>
Oxymetazoline [6-tert-butyl-3-(4,5-dihydro-1 -H-imidazol-2- ylmethyl)-2,4-di-<br>
methylphenol] and xylometazoline [2- (4-tert-butyl-2,6-dimethylbenzyl)-4,5-<br>
dihydro-1-/-/-imidazole] are imidazole α-sympathomimetics with a vasocon-<br>
strictive action which are preferably employed locally for decongesting the<br>
mucous membrane in the nose. In particular, aqueous solutions are used<br>
here.<br>
Oxymetazoline and xylometazoline are unstable in aqueous solution.<br>
Although oxymetazoline and xylometazoline are more stable in aqueous<br>
solution in the form of their hydrochloride salts, undesired hydrolytic degra-<br>
dation of the active compounds, in particular due to hydrolytic cleavage of<br>
the imidazole ring, does also occur in these on storage, in particular at ele-<br>
vated temperature. Undesired degradation products, which may be associ-<br>
ated with the risk of harmful side effects on use of the aqueous solution as<br>
medicament, form and the content of active compound drops. Overall, the<br>
shelf life of the aqueous solution is reduced.<br>
As a consequence of hydrolytic cleavage of the imidazoline ring, oxymeta-<br>
zoline and xylometazoline in aqueous solution form, in particular, A/-(2-<br>
aminoethyl)-2-[4-(1,1 -dimethylethyl)-3-hydroxy-2,6-dimethylphenyl]-<br>
acetamide and A/-(2-aminoethyl)-2-[4-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-2,6-dimethyl-<br>
phenyl]acetamide respectively. These degradation products are also listed<br>
as impurities in the monographs relating to these active compounds in the<br>
European Pharmacopoeia 2003.<br><br>
Hydrolytic degradation of oxymetazoline and xylometazoline can be pre-<br>
vented if a non-aqueous solvent, for example oils or organic solvents, are<br>
employed instead of the aqueous solvent. However, oils have a compara-<br>
tively higher viscosity and poorer ability to wet hydrophilic surfaces, which<br>
stands in the way of fine distribution of the active compound present on the<br>
nasal mucous membrane in the case of nasal administration. Organic sol-<br>
vents are usually not toxicologically acceptable and/or result in irritation of<br>
the nasal mucous membrane. Non-aqueous formulations also appear less<br>
suitable for the development of active-compound solutions owing to their<br>
viscosity or possible interactions with packaging materials and dispensing<br>
systems, in particular those made from plastics. This applies in particular to<br>
spray bottles made from plastics, which are widely used for rhinological<br>
agents.<br>
The object of the present invention was to provide an aqueous solution of<br>
oxymetazoline and/or xylometazoline having increased stability. In particu-<br>
lar, the aim was to reduce hydrolytic degradation as a consequence of<br>
cleavage of the imidazoline ring.<br>
Surprisingly, it has been found that a stable aqueous solution comprising<br>
oxymetazoline and/or xylometazoline can be obtained if the latter com-<br>
prises a zinc salt and a buffer salt in addition to the oxymetazoline and/or<br>
xylometazoline. The present invention therefore relates to an aqueous<br>
solution comprising at least oxymetazoline and/or xylometazoline, a zinc<br>
salt and a buffer salt.<br>
For the purposes of the invention, an aqueous solution is present if at least<br>
some of the solvent present consists of water. Further solvent constituents<br>
that may be present are all solvents which are suitable for nasal administra-<br>
tion, in particular alcohols, such as, for example, ethanol, propanol, pro-<br>
panediol or glycerol. The aqueous solution preferably comprises water or<br><br>
ethanol/water mixtures as solvent, the solvent particularly preferably con-<br>
sists of water.<br>
In the aqueous solution according to the invention, oxymetazoline and/or<br>
xylometazoline is preferably present in the form of one of its pharmaceuti-<br>
cally tolerated salts, such as, for example, as hydrochloride or as nitrate.<br>
Oxymetazoline and/or xylometazoline are particularly preferably each pre-<br>
sent as hydrochloride. Any oxymetazoline or xylometazoline amount data<br>
contained in the present patent application in each case relate to the corre-<br>
sponding hydrochloride salts. Other salt forms of oxymetazoline nitrate or<br>
xylometazoline nitrate are employed in an equimolar amount corresponding<br>
to the respective hydrochloride salt.<br>
As zinc salt, use can be made in accordance with the invention of all phar-<br>
maceutical^ acceptable zinc salts. Preference is given to zinc chloride, zinc<br>
lactate, zinc sulfate, zinc citrate, zinc acetate, zinc histidinate, zinc orotate,<br>
zinc aspartate and/or zinc gluconate. The zinc salt present is particularly<br>
preferably zinc gluconate.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention, buffer salts are the salts of weak<br>
acids with strong bases or of weak bases with strong acids, which dissoci-<br>
ate completely in aqueous solution and form a buffer system in the pres-<br>
ence of the respective salt-forming acid or base. Buffer salts which can be<br>
used in accordance with the invention are, for example, alkali metal salts, in<br>
particular the sodium and/or potassium salts, of pharmaceutically usable<br>
weak organic or inorganic acids, such as, for example, acetic acid or citric<br>
acid, or boric acid. The buffer salt present is particularly preferably sodium<br>
citrate.<br>
According to an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the aqueous<br>
solution furthermore comprises a pharmaceutically acceptable acid or<br>
base. The acid or base present can be any pharmaceutically acceptable<br><br>
acids or bases which do not result in incompatibilities with the other<br>
constituents of the aqueous solution according to the invention. The acid<br>
present is preferably the respective acid forming the buffer salt, i.e. the acid<br>
form of the anion present in the buffer salt, or the base present is<br>
preferably the base forming the buffer salt, i.e. the base form of the cation<br>
present in the buffer salt. For example, the aqueous solution according to<br>
the invention may, besides the buffer salt sodium citrate, comprise citric<br>
acid, i.e. the acid form of the citrate ions present as anion in the buffer salt,<br>
or NaOH, i.e. the base form of the sodium ions present as cation in the<br>
buffer salt.<br>
The aqueous solution according to the invention can, for nasal administra-<br>
tion, be applied in all medicament forms which are suitable for nasal ad-<br>
ministration, such as, for example, nasal drops or nasal sprays, by means<br>
of dispensing devices suitable for this purpose, such as bottles with drop<br>
device or nasal spray pumps.<br>
According to an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the aqueous<br>
solution has a pH of pH 4 to pH 7.5, preferably a pH of pH 5.0 to pH 7.2,<br>
particularly preferably a pH of about pH 6.0. The pH can be set accurately<br>
here by addition of the acid or base corresponding to the buffer salt and/or<br>
by addition of another physiologically tolerated acid or base. For example,<br>
the desired pH of a sodium citrate-containing solution can be set by addi-<br>
tion of the acid form of the anion present in the buffer salt, i.e. by addition<br>
of citric acid, or by addition of the base form of the cation present in the<br>
buffer salt, i.e. by addition of NaOH, and/or by addition of another acid or<br>
base, in particular by addition of hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide<br>
solution.<br>
In order to improve the ability of the aqueous solution to be tolerated on<br>
administration to the nasal mucous membrane, it is advantageous to for-<br>
mulate it as isotonic solution. Isotonicity is present at an osmolality of about<br><br>
280 mOsm. The osmolality can be set by variation of the amounts of the<br>
dissolved substances present in the aqueous solution besides oxymeta-<br>
zoline and/or xylometazoline, i.e. the zinc salt, buffer salt and any further<br>
substances present, and/or by addition of an isotonicity agent, preferably a<br>
physiologically tolerated salt, such as, for example, sodium chloride or<br>
potassium chloride, or a physiologically tolerated polyol, such as, for exam-<br>
ple, a sugar alcohol, in particular sorbitol or glycerol, in the concentration<br>
necessary for rendering isotonic. The osmolality is preferably set by selec-<br>
tion of the dissolved substance amounts present anyway in the aqueous<br>
solution, so that it is not necessary to add an isotonicity agent.<br>
The aqueous solution according to the invention comprises oxymetazoline<br>
and/or xylometazoline in a concentration of 0.005% by weight to 1.0% by<br>
weight. Oxymetazoline and/or xylometazoline is preferably present in a<br>
concentration of 0.01% by weight to 0.5% by weight, very particularly pref-<br>
erably in a concentration of between 0.05% by weight to 0.1 % by weight.<br>
The aqueous solution according to the invention comprises that the zinc<br>
salt in a proportion of 0.1% by weight to 10% by weight. The zinc salt is<br>
preferably present in a proportion of 1.8 - 6.0% by weight.<br>
The buffer salt is present in a proportion of 0.01% by weight to 3.0% by<br>
weight. The buffer salt is preferably present in a proportion of 0.2 - 1.5% by<br>
weight.<br>
According to an advantageous embodiment, the aqueous solution accord-<br>
ing to the invention comprises 0.005% by weight to 0.1% by weight of oxy-<br>
metazoline hydrochloride or xylometazoline hydrochloride, 1 % by weight to<br>
10% by weight of zinc gluconate and 0.5% by weight to 5% by weight of cit-<br>
rate and has a pH of about 6.<br><br>
According to an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the aqueous<br>
solution comprises only one of the active compounds oxymetazoline and<br>
xylometazoline in the form of its hydrochloride salt.<br>
