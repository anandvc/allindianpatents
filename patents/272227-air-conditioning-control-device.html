AIR CONDITIONING CONTROL DEVICE<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to an air conditioning control device for obtaining and<br>
monitoring operational data related to air conditioners.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
There are conventionally known systems that obtain data such as temperature setting<br>
data, power consumption data, and operating mode data from air conditioners and the like<br>
when monitoring air conditioners. The monitoring system described in Patent Document 1<br>
given below is an example of a system for monitoring abnormal data produced by air<br>
conditioners. In this monitoring system, when an abnormality occurs in the air conditioner,<br>
details of the abnormality, including data on the occurrence of the abnormality and data on<br>
the most recent operating status, are transmitted from a monitoring device that is monitoring<br>
the air conditioner to a remote monitoring device. The details on the abnormality that have<br>
been transmitted are then stored and collected as needed in the database for the operating data<br>
in the remote monitoring device. Onsite service staff members can thereby promptly handle<br>
abnormal occurrences by communicating over the internet using a portable terminal in their<br>
personal possession to extract and receive data on the operating status from the last 30<br>
minutes to the present from among the details of the abnormality in the database for the<br>
operating data. That is, in the process carried out by this monitoring system, data on the<br>
operating status within a certain recent time range is extracted from the data that has been<br>
collected in the database for the operating data.<br>

DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
PROBLEMS THE INVENTION IS INTENDED TO SOLVE<br>
Recently there has been concern over the depletion of primary energy sources such<br>
as fossil fuels, and there is also a need to conserve energy in the interests of cutting down on<br>
CO2 (global-warming gas) emissions, and the like. Research is being done on ways to<br>
reduce power consumption using operating data such as temperature setting data, power<br>
consumption data, and operating mode data of air conditioners and the like in the monitoring<br>
systems of the above technology. In view of the foregoing, an object of the present<br>
invention is to monitor operating data related to power consumption and the like in air<br>
conditioners, and to inform users of the operating status of the air conditioner, leading to<br>
 <br>
lower power consumption.<br>
MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEMS<br>
The air conditioning control device according to a first aspect of the invention is an<br>
air conditioning control device for obtaining and controlling data on an air conditioner<br>
including a plurality of indoor units, the device comprising a data retrieval component, a data<br>
collection component, an analysis component, and an analyzed results display component.<br>
The data retrieval component retrieves air conditioner operating data including power<br>
consumption data for each indoor unit. The data collection component collects operating<br>
data at certain periods of time. The analysis component analyzes operating data for each<br>
indoor unit. The analyzed results display component visualizes and displays the analyzed<br>
data that has been analyzed by the analysis component<br>
In the present invention, operating data including air conditioner power consumption<br>
data is retrieved and collected, and analyzed data that has been analyzed based on the<br>
collected operating data is visualized and displayed by an analyzed results display component.<br>
The user can thus ascertain the operating status and can readily implement countermeasures<br>
to reduce power consumption.<br>
The air conditioning control device according to a second aspect of the invention is<br>
the air conditioning control device according to the first aspect, the device further comprising<br>
an power consumption countermeasure table and an extraction component. The power<br>
consumption countermeasure table associates the analyzed data with countermeasures for<br>
reducing power consumption. The power consumption countermeasure table is<br>
countermeasures that allow the power consumption of the air condition as a whole to be<br>
reduced. The extraction component extracts the countermeasures for reducing power<br>
consumption from the power consumption countermeasure table based on the analyzed data.<br>
The analyzed results display component further displays the countermeasures for reducing<br>
power consumption extracted by the extraction component.<br>
In the present invention, pre-determined power consumption countermeasures can be<br>
displayed by the analyzed results display component based on the analyzed results. The<br>
user can thus effectively implement countermeasures to reduce power consumption in<br>
response to the operating status of the air conditioner.<br>
The air conditioning control device according to a third aspect of the invention is the<br>
air conditioning control device according to the second aspect, wherein the operating data<br>
retrieved by the data retrieval component includes air conditioning temperature setting data,<br>
which are the target temperature settings when the indoor units are air conditioning an indoor<br>
 <br>
area. The data collection component associates the air conditioning temperature setting data<br>
with the power consumption data to collect the data as temperature setting-power<br>
consumption data per indoor unit. The analysis component, based on the temperature<br>
setting-power consumption data, selects a certain number of indoor units in order of the<br>
greatest power consumption from among indoor units in which the target temperature setting<br>
is lower than a first predetermined temperature setting when in cooling operation, and indoor<br>
units in which the target temperature setting is over a second predetermined temperature<br>
setting when in heating operation. The analysis display component visualizes and further<br>
displays the temperature setting-power consumption data of the indoor units selected by the<br>
analysis component.<br>
In the present invention, the power consumption data and air conditioning<br>
temperature setting data retrieved by the data retrieval component are associated and<br>
collected, in the data collection component, as temperature setting-power consumption data<br>
for each indoor unit. Based on the collected temperature setting-power consumption data,<br>
the analysis component selects a certain number of indoor units in order of the greatest power<br>
consumption from among indoor units in which the target temperature setting is lower than a<br>
first predetermined temperature setting when in cooling operation, and selects a certain<br>
number of indoor units in the order of indoor units with the greatest power consumption from<br>
among indoor units in which the target temperature setting is a over second predetermined<br>
temperature setting when in heating operation. The temperature setting-power consumption<br>
data of the certain number of indoor units selected by the analysis component is further<br>
visualized and displayed by the analyzed results display component.<br>
The analysis component can thus select a certain number of indoor units in which<br>
the target temperature settings are a temperature that is so low (during cooling operation) or<br>
that is so high (during heating operation) that such a temperature cannot be recommended,<br>
resulting in a high possibility of wasted energy. The target temperature settings and power<br>
consumption of the selected indoor units can also be visualized to notify the user. The user<br>
can therefore be notified of indoor units which are highly likely to be wasting energy along<br>
with operating data, leading to countermeasures for reducing power consumption.<br>
The air conditioning control device according to a fourth aspect of the invention is<br>
the air conditioning control device according to the third aspect, wherein the extraction<br>
component extracts, from the power consumption countermeasure table, countermeasures for<br>
reducing power consumption that recommend increasing the target temperature settings of<br>
the indoor units selected by the analysis component when in cooling operation. The<br>
 <br>
extraction component also extracts, from the power consumption countermeasure table,<br>
countermeasures for reducing power consumption that recommend lowering the target<br>
temperature settings of the indoor units selected by the analysis component when in heating<br>
operation. The analyzed results display component further displays the countermeasures for<br>
reducing power consumption that have been extracted by the extraction component.<br>
In the present invention, the user is advised to increase the target temperature<br>
settings of the indoor units selected by the analysis component when in cooling operation and<br>
to lower the target temperature settings when in heating operation.<br>
The user can thus be presented with countermeasures for reducing power<br>
consumption, and not merely shown the operating data of indoor units that are highly likely<br>
to be wasting energy. Effective measures for reducing power consumption can thus be<br>
presented, and the burden on the user can be alleviated.<br>
The air conditioning control device according to a fifth aspect of the invention is the<br>
air conditioning control device according to the second aspect, wherein the operating data<br>
retrieved by the data retrieval component includes power demand data which is the power<br>
consumption data by time range. The data collection component collects the power demand<br>
data as indoor unit power demand data for each indoor unit. The analysis component<br>
analyzes the power demand data to calculate the peak production time during which the<br>
overall peak power demand for the air conditioner as a whole is produced. The analysis<br>
component also selects a certain number of indoor units in order of the greatest indoor unit<br>
power demand per indoor unit in the peak production time. The analyzed results display<br>
component visualizes and further displays the indoor unit power demand data in peak<br>
production time of the indoor units selected by the analysis component.<br>
In the present invention, the power demand data retrieved by the data retrieval<br>
component is collected for each indoor unit in the data collection component. Based on the<br>
collected power demand data, the analysis component calculates the peak production time<br>
during which the overall peak power demand is produced in the air conditioner as a whole,<br>
and selects a certain number of indoor units in order of the greatest indoor unit power demand<br>
per indoor unit in the peak production time. The indoor unit power demand in the peak<br>
production time in the certain number of indoor units selected by the analysis component is<br>
furthermore visualized and displayed by the analyzed results display component.<br>
The analysis component can thus select a certain number of indoor units in which<br>
the indoor unit power demand is greater in the peak production time, and the overall power<br>
demand is highly likely to be significantly affected. The indoor unit power demand of the<br>
 <br>
selected indoor units can also be visualized to alert the user. The user can therefore be<br>
notified of indoor units in which the overall power demand is highly likely to be significantly<br>
affected, along with the operating data, leading to countermeasures for reducing power<br>
consumption.<br>
The air conditioning control device according to a sixth aspect is the air conditioning<br>
control device according to the fifth aspect, wherein the extraction component extracts, from<br>
the power consumption countermeasure table, countermeasures for reducing power<br>
consumption that recommend suppressing and controlling the power demand of the indoor<br>
units selected by the analysis component. The analyzed results display component further<br>
displays the countermeasures for reducing power consumption that have been extracted by<br>
the extraction component.<br>
In the present invention, the user is advised to suppress and control power demand in<br>
indoor units selected by the analysis component.<br>
The user can thus be presented with countermeasures for reducing power<br>
consumption, and not merely shown the operating data of indoor units in which it is highly<br>
likely that overall power demand is significantly affected. Effective measures for reducing<br>
power consumption can thus be presented, and the burden on the user can be alleviated.<br>
The air conditioning control device according to a seventh aspect of the invention is<br>
the air conditioning control device according to the second aspect, wherein the operating data<br>
that has been retrieved by the data retrieval component includes outdoor temperature data.<br>
The data collection component associates the outdoor air data and the power consumption<br>
data to collect the data as power consumption data by outdoor temperature for each indoor<br>
unit. The analysis component analyzes the overall indoor unit trend of the indoor units as a<br>
whole and the indoor unit trends of each of the indoor units based on the power consumption<br>
data by outdoor temperature. The analysis component also selects a certain number of<br>
indoor units in the order of greatest indoor unit trend displacement based on the overall<br>
indoor unit trend. The analyzed results display component visualizes and further displays<br>
the compared data from the comparison of the indoor unit trends and the overall indoor unit<br>
trend of the indoor units which have been selected by the analysis component.<br>
In the present invention, the power consumption data and outdoor temperature data<br>
retrieved by the data retrieval component are associated and are collected in the data<br>
collection component as power consumption data by outdoor temperature for each indoor unit.<br>
Based on the collected power consumption data by outdoor temperature, the analysis<br>
component selects a certain number of indoor units in order of indoor units with the greatest<br>
 <br>
displacement in an indoor unit trend based on the overall indoor unit trend. The compared<br>
data from the comparison of the indoor unit trends and the overall indoor unit trend of the<br>
certain number of indoor units which have been selected by the analysis component is<br>
furthermore visualized and displayed by the analyzed results display component.<br>
The analysis component can thus select a certain number of indoor units which are<br>
highly likely to be air conditioning indoor areas where there is a substantial external load or<br>
internal load. The compared data from the comparison of the indoor unit trends and the<br>
overall indoor unit trend of the indoor units which have been selected can be visualized to<br>
alert the user. The user can therefore be notified of the indoor units which are highly likely<br>
to be air conditioning indoor areas where there is a substantial external load or internal load,<br>
along with the operating data, leading to countermeasures for reducing power consumption.<br>
The air conditioning control device according to an eighth aspect of the invention is<br>
the air conditioning control device according to the seventh aspect, wherein the extraction<br>
component extracts, from the power consumption countermeasure table, countermeasures for<br>
reducing power consumption that recommend suppressing the external load on the indoor<br>
area being air conditioned by the indoor units selected by the analysis component when there<br>
is a significant air conditioning load due to the outdoor temperature. The analyzed results<br>
display component further displays the countermeasures for reducing power consumption<br>
extracted by the extraction component.<br>
In the present invention, the user is advised, for example, to lower blinds to block<br>
externally radiated heat or to lower the level of introduced outdoor air having a substantial<br>
load, so as to suppress the external load on the indoor units selected by the analysis<br>
component.<br>
The user can thus be presented with countermeasures for reducing power<br>
consumption, and not merely shown the operating data of indoor units that are highly likely<br>
to be air conditioning indoor areas where there is a substantial external load. Effective<br>
measures for reducing power consumption can thus be presented, and the burden on the user<br>
can also be alleviated.<br>
In the air conditioning control device according to a ninth aspect of the invention,<br>
the extraction component according to the seventh aspect extracts, from the power<br>
consumption countermeasure table, countermeasures for reducing power consumption that<br>
recommend increasing the level of outdoor air introduced into the indoor area being air<br>
conditioned by the indoor units selected by the analysis component when there is a low air<br>
conditioning load due to the outdoor temperature. The analyzed results display component<br>
 <br>
further displays the countermeasures for reducing power consumption extracted by the<br>
extraction component.<br>
In the present invention, the user is advised to increase the level of outdoor air<br>
introduced to the indoor units selected by the analysis component.<br>
The user can thus be presented with countermeasures for reducing power<br>
consumption, and not merely shown the operating data of indoor units that are highly likely<br>
to be air conditioning indoor areas where there is a substantial internal load. Effective<br>
measures for reducing power consumption can thus be presented, and the burden on the user<br>
can also be alleviated.<br>
The air conditioning control device according to a tenth aspect of the invention is the<br>
air conditioning control device according to the second aspect, wherein the operating data<br>
retrieved by the data retrieval component includes change frequency data and changed time<br>
range data. The change frequency data is data obtained by counting the number of times the<br>
air conditioning temperature settings, which are the target temperature settings, have changed<br>
when the indoor units are air conditioning an indoor area. The changed time range data is<br>
the time range in which the air conditioning temperature settings have changed. The data<br>
collection component associates the change frequency data and the changed time range data<br>
to collect the data as change frequency data by time range for each indoor unit. The analysis<br>
component selects a certain number of indoor units in the order of greatest overall change<br>
frequency for each of the indoor units based on the change frequency data by time range.<br>
The analyzed results display component visualizes and further displays the change frequency<br>
data by time range for the indoor units that have been selected by the analysis component.<br>
In the present invention, the change data and changed time range data retrieved by<br>
the data retrieval component are associated and collected as change frequency data by time<br>
range in the data collection component for each indoor unit. Based on the collected change<br>
frequency data by time range, the analysis component selects a certain number of indoor units<br>
in the order of indoor units with the most frequent overall change frequency in each indoor<br>
unit. The change frequency data by time range for the certain number of indoor units that<br>
have been selected by the analysis component is further visualized and displayed on the<br>
analyzed results display component.<br>
The analysis component thus can select a certain number of indoor units in which<br>
the sensory temperature and target temperature settings are highly likely to be not matched.<br>
The change frequency data by time range for the indoor units that have been selected can be<br>
visualized to notify the user. The user can therefore be notified of the indoor units in which<br>
 <br>
the sensory temperature and target temperature settings are highly likely to be not matched,<br>
along with the operating data, leading to countermeasures for reducing power consumption.<br>
The air conditioning control device according to an eleventh aspect of the invention<br>
is the air conditioning control device according to the tenth aspect, wherein the extraction<br>
component extracts, from the power consumption countermeasure table, countermeasures for<br>
reducing power consumption that recommend suppressing the external load on the indoor<br>
area being air conditioned by the indoor units selected by the analysis component. The<br>
analyzed results display component further displays the countermeasures for reducing power<br>
consumption that have been extracted by the extraction component.<br>
In the present invention, the user is advised, for example, to lower blinds to block<br>
externally radiated heat or to lower the level of introduced outdoor air having a substantial<br>
load, so as to suppress the external load on the indoor units selected by the analysis<br>
component.<br>
The user can thus be presented with countermeasures for reducing power<br>
consumption, and not merely shown the operating data of indoor units that are highly likely<br>
to be air conditioning indoor areas where there is a substantial external load. This can<br>
therefore lead to effective countermeasures for reducing power consumption, and can also<br>
alleviate the burden on users.<br>
The air conditioning control device according to a twelfth aspect of the invention is<br>
the air conditioning control device according to the second aspect, wherein the operating data<br>
retrieved by the data retrieval component includes outdoor temperature data and data on<br>
times when the thermostat is off for each indoor unit. The data collection component<br>
associates the outdoor temperature data and the data on times the thermostat is off, and<br>
collects the data as data on times the thermostat is off by outdoor temperature for each indoor<br>
unit. The analysis component selects a certain number of indoor units in the order of the<br>
longest time for which the thermostat is off by outdoor temperature based on the data on<br>
times the thermostat is off by outdoor temperature. The analyzed results display component<br>
visualizes and further displays the data on times the thermostat is off by outdoor temperature<br>
for the indoor units that have been selected by the analysis component.<br>
In the present invention, the outdoor temperature data and data on times when the<br>
thermostat is off that have been retrieved by the data retrieval component are associated and<br>
accumulated as data on times the thermostat is off by outdoor temperature for each indoor<br>
unit in the data collection component. Based on the collected data on times the thermostat is<br>
off by outdoor temperature, the analysis component selects a certain number of indoor units<br>
 <br>
in the order of the indoor units with the longest time for which the thermostat is off by<br>
outdoor temperature. The analyzed results display component visualizes and further<br>
displays the data on times the thermostat is off by outdoor temperature for the indoor units<br>
that have been selected by the analysis component.<br>
The analysis component can thus select a certain number of indoor units for which<br>
the thermostat will be off for a long time and air will highly likely be blown wastefully. The<br>
data on times the thermostat is off by outdoor temperature for the indoor units that have been<br>
selected can be visualized to notify the user. The user can therefore be notified of the indoor<br>
units for which the thermostat will be off for a long time and air will highly likely be blown<br>
wastefully, along with the operating data, leading to countermeasures for reducing power<br>
consumption.<br>
The air conditioning control device according to a thirteenth aspect of the invention<br>
is the air conditioning control device according to the twelfth aspect, wherein the extraction<br>
component extracts, from the power consumption countermeasure table, countermeasures for<br>
reducing power consumption that recommend stopping the operation of the indoor units<br>
selected by the analysis component. The analyzed results display component further<br>
displays the countermeasures for reducing power consumption that have been extracted by<br>
the extraction component.<br>
In the present invention, the user is advised to stop the operation of indoor units<br>
selected by the analysis component.<br>
The user can thus be presented with countermeasures for reducing power<br>
consumption, and not merely shown the operating data of indoor units that are highly likely<br>
to be only blowing air wastefully. This can therefore lead to effective countermeasures for<br>
reducing power consumption, and the burden on the user can also be alleviated.<br>
The air conditioning control device according to a fourteenth aspect of the invention<br>
is the air conditioning control device according to the twelfth or thirteenth aspect, further<br>
comprising a control component for stopping the indoor units selected by the analysis<br>
component based on the data on times the thermostat is off.<br>
The present invention further comprises a control component for automatically<br>
stopping the operation of indoor units selected by the analysis component. Indoor units that<br>
are highly likely to be only blowing air wastefully can therefore be stopped automatically<br>
without the user having to stop them. The burden on the user can therefore be alleviated.<br>

 <br>
trend of the indoor units which have been selected can be visualized to alert the user. The<br>
user can therefore be notified of the indoor units which are highly likely to be air<br>
conditioning indoor areas where there is a substantial external load or internal load, along<br>
with operating data, leading to countermeasures for reducing power consumption.<br>
The air conditioning control device according to an eighth aspect of the invention<br>
allows the user to be presented with countermeasures for reducing power consumption, and<br>
not merely shown the operating data of indoor units that are highly likely to be air<br>
conditioning indoor areas where there is a substantial external load. Effective measures for<br>
reducing power consumption can thus be presented, and the burden on the user can also be<br>
alleviated.<br>
The air conditioning control device according to a ninth aspect of the invention<br>
allows the user to be presented with countermeasures for reducing power consumption, and<br>
not merely shown the operating data of indoor units that are highly likely to be air<br>
conditioning indoor areas where there is a substantial internal load. Effective measures for<br>
reducing power consumption can thus be presented, and the burden on the user can also be<br>
alleviated.<br>
The air conditioning control device according to a tenth aspect of the invention, the<br>
analysis component can select a certain number of indoor units in which the sensory<br>
temperature and target temperature settings are highly likely to be not matched. The change<br>
frequency data by time range for the indoor units that have been selected can be visualized to<br>
notify the user. The user can therefore be notified of the indoor units in which the sensory<br>
temperature and target temperature settings are highly likely to be not matched, along with<br>
the operating data, leading to countermeasures for reducing power consumption.<br>

burden on users.<br>
The air conditioning control device according to the twelfth aspect of the invention,<br>
the analysis component can select a certain number of indoor units for which the thermostat<br>
will be off for a long time and air will highly likely be blown wastefully. The data on times<br>
the thermostat is off by outdoor temperature for the indoor units that have been selected can<br>
be visualized to notify the user. The user can therefore be notified of the indoor units for<br>
 <br>
which the thermostat will be off for a long time and air will highly likely be blown wastefully,<br>

The air conditioning control device according to the fourteenth aspect of the<br>
invention allows indoor units that are highly likely to be only blowing air wastefully to be<br>
stopped automatically without the user having to stop the units. The burden on the user can<br>
therefore be alleviated.<br>

Schematic Structure of Air Conditioning Monitor/Support System<br>
The air conditioning monitor/support system according to the present invention is an<br>
air conditioning monitor/support system which is mounted in an office building or the like, as<br>
illustrated in FIG. 1, and is composed primarily of a monitor device 2, central remote control<br>
3, a first air conditioner 4 and a second air conditioner 5 as two systems, and an air<br>
conditioning network 6. In the air conditioner monitor/support system 1, the first air<br>
conditioner 4 and second air conditioner 5 are connected by the air conditioning network 6 to<br>
the monitor device 2. The first air conditioner 4 and second air conditioner 5 are each<br>
monitored by the monitor device 2.<br>
The air conditioner monitor/support system 1 is a system for retrieving operating<br>
data such as the operating status or operating condition of the air conditioners 4 and 5,<br>
performing certain processes on the retrieved data in order to monitor the air conditioners 4<br>
and 5, visualizing the operating data related to the air conditioners 4 and 5, displaying<br>
countermeasures leading to energy conservation, and encouraging users such as building<br>
administrators to adopt energy conservation measures.<br>
(1) Schematic Structure of Air Conditioning Control Device<br>
The monitor device 2 is composed of a data processor 21, memory 22, display<br>
component such as a display (output component) 23, communications component 24 such as<br>
a communications interface, keyboard 25, mouse 26, control component 27, and the like.<br>
The data processor 21 derives certain types of data by computing and processing<br>
various types of data obtained from the memory 22 or communications component 24, such<br>
as operating data processing, extraction processing, and display processing, according to a<br>
computing program stored in the memory 22, and transmits the data to the memory 22,<br>
display component 23, and communications component 24.<br>
 <br>
The memory 22 stores data related to the air conditioners 4 and 5, such as tables<br>
needed to control the first air conditioner 4 and second air conditioner 5, position data and<br>
grouping data, which are needed for communication with the first air conditioner 4 and<br>
second air conditioner 5 or the like. The memory 22 stores air conditioning status data,<br>
which is daily data for each of the air conditioners 4 and 5. From the air conditioners 4 and<br>
5, various types of data (see description below) related to the operating status or operating<br>
condition of the air conditioners 4 and 5 are stored in the memory 22 via the communications<br>
component 24. Also stored there is a power consumption countermeasure table 22a in<br>
which the results of operating data analysis described below are associated with the optimal<br>
power consumption countermeasure corresponding to the results of analysis.<br>
The display component 23 outputs displays such as those in FIGS. 5 through 20 in<br>
response to processing from the data processor 21 based on data recorded in the memory 22<br>
(see below).<br>
The control component 27 controls the air conditioners 4 and 5 according to a<br>
program, operating data, or the like stored in the memory 22.<br>
(2) First Air Conditioner<br>
FIG. 3 is a first story plan of a building (not shown) in which the air conditioner<br>
monitor/support system 1 of this embodiment is set up. The first air conditioner 4 is located<br>
on the first floor of a building, as shown in FIG. 3. The first air conditioner 4 is an apparatus<br>
referred to as a multi-type air conditioner with a plurality of indoor units 42a through 42f<br>
connected to an outdoor unit 41. This is an air conditioner that is capable of cooling and<br>
heating by switching between operation modes such as a cooling operation mode and heating<br>
operation mode. The first floor of the building is divided, as illustrated in FIG. 3, into three<br>
rooms: a room A RM11, room B RM12, and room C RM 13. As illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 2,<br>
the first air conditioner 4 is composed primarily of an outdoor unit 41, a plurality of indoor<br>
units 42a through 42f (six according to the present embodiment), and a plurality of wired<br>
remote controls 31 through 33 (three according to the present embodiment). The plurality<br>
of indoor units 42a through 42f is connected to the same outdoor unit 41 and is related to the<br>
same air conditioning system (first floor air conditioning system). The outdoor unit 41,<br>
plurality of indoor units 42a through 42f, and wired remote controls 31 through 33 are<br>
mutually connected through the air conditioning network 6. Of the plurality of indoor units<br>
42a through 42f, three (indoor units 42a through 42c) are located in room A RM11, two<br>
(indoor units 42d and 42e) are located in room B RM12, and one (indoor unit 42f) is located<br>
in room C RM13. These indoor units 42a through 42f are divided into groups for each room,<br>
 <br>
where the indoor units 42a through 42c set up in room A RM11 are stored as Group Gl, the<br>
indoor units 42d and 42e set up in room B RM12 are stored as Group G2, and the indoor unit<br>
42f set up in room C RM13 is stored as Group G3 in a grouping data in the memory 22.<br>
According to the present embodiment, moreover, the three indoor units 42a through 42c in<br>
room A RM11 are controlled by the monitor device 2 and the wired remote control 31 set up<br>
in room A RM11. The two indoor units 42d and 42e in room B RM12 are controlled by the<br>
monitor device 2 and the wired remote 32 set up in the room B. The indoor unit 42f in room<br>
C RM13 is controlled by the monitor device 2 and the wired remote 33 set up in room C.<br>
(3) Second Air Conditioner (Simultaneous Cooling and Heating Operation)<br>
FIG. 4 is a second and third story plan of a building in which the air conditioner<br>
monitor/support system 1 according to this embodiment is set up. The second air<br>
conditioner 5 is an apparatus referred to as a multi-type air conditioner with a plurality of<br>
indoor units 52a through 52f connected to an outdoor unit 51 located on the second and third<br>
floors of the building according to the present embodiment. This is a multi-air conditioner<br>
capable of performing the simultaneous cooling and heating operation in which cooling and<br>
heating are automatically switched therebetween according to temperature settings. The<br>
second air conditioner 5 set up on the third floor is the same structure as on the second floor.<br>
Only the second air conditioner 5 on the second floor will be described here. As illustrated<br>
in FIG. 4, the second floor of the building is only a single large room D RM21 (the third floor<br>
is room E RM31), and six second air conditioners 5 are set up in the room D RM21. The<br>
room D RM21 is divided into three imaginary zones: a north zone Zl on the north side, a<br>
middle zone Z2 in the middle of the room D RM21, and a south zone Z3 on the south side.<br>
As illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 2, the second air conditioner 5 is composed primarily of an<br>
outdoor unit 51, a plurality of indoor units 52a through 52f (six according to the present<br>
embodiment), a plurality of switching units 53a through 53c (three according to the present<br>
embodiment), and a plurality of wired remote controls 34 through 36 (three according to the<br>
present embodiment). The plurality of indoor units 52a through 52f is connected to the<br>
same outdoor unit 51 and is related to the same air conditioning system (second or third floor<br>
air conditioning system). The outdoor unit 51, plurality of indoor units 52a through 52f, and<br>
wired remote controls 34 through 36 are mutually connected through the air conditioning<br>
network 6. Two each of the plurality of indoor units 52a through 52f are located in groups<br>
of two in each of the three divided zones, where indoor units 52a and 52b in the north zone<br>
Zl are stored as group G4, indoor units 52c and 52d in the middle zone Z2 are stored as<br>
group G5, and indoor units 52e and 52f in the south zone Z3 are stored as group G6 in the<br>
 <br>
grouping data in the memory 22. The three corresponding switching units 53a through 53c<br>
are connected to the groups G4 through G6, respectively, where the switching unit 53a is<br>
connected to the indoor units 52a and 52b of the group G4, the switching unit 53b is<br>
connected to the indoor units 52c and 52d of the group G5, and the switching unit 53c is<br>
connected to the indoor units 52e and 52f of the group G6. The switching units 53a through<br>
53c are also units capable of switching between cooling operation and heating operation in<br>
response to temperature settings set by the user. According to the present embodiment,<br>
moreover, the two indoor units 52a and 52b of group G4 are controlled by the monitor device<br>
2 and the wired remote control 34 set up in the north zone Z1. The two indoor units 52c and<br>
52d in the group G5 are controlled by the monitor device 2 and the wired remote 35 set up in<br>
the middle zone Z2. The two indoor units 52e and 52f in the group G6 are controlled by the<br>
monitor device 2 and the wired remote 36 set up in the south zone Z3.<br>
Monitoring of Air Conditioners<br>
As noted above, the monitor device 2 retrieves air conditioner operating data from<br>
the air conditioners 4 and 5 through the communications component 24. Specifically, the<br>
monitor device 2 retrieves operating data for each of the air conditioners 4 and 5 from the air<br>
conditioners 4 and 5, and stores the data in memory 22. Here, a year of operating data is<br>
retrieved for each of the indoor units 42a through 42f and 52a through 52f of the air<br>
conditioners 4 and 5. The period of time for retrieving operating data here is not limited to<br>
one year and can be set by the user, for example to six months, a year and a half, or two years.<br>
The operating data includes power consumption data, air conditioning temperature setting<br>
data, power demand data, outdoor temperature data, change frequency data, changed time<br>
range data, and data on times when the thermostat is off. What is referred to here as "power<br>
consumption data" is data on the energy consumed by each of the indoor units 42a through<br>
42f and 52a through 52f. What is referred to here as "air conditioning temperature setting<br>
data" is the target temperature setting when indoor areas are being air conditioned by the<br>
indoor units 42a through 42f and 52a through 52f, which the user can set by remote control or<br>
air conditioning control device input component. What is referred to here as "power<br>
demand data" is data on the power demanded by each of the indoor units 42a through 42f and<br>
52a through 52f. What is referred to here as "outdoor temperature data" is data on the<br>
outdoor temperature detected by a temperature sensor located in an outdoor unit or the like.<br>
What is referred to here as "change frequency data" is data obtained by counting the number<br>
of times the air conditioning temperature setting is changed per day for each of the indoor<br>
units 42a through 42f and 52a through 52f. What is referred to as "changed time range data"<br>
 <br>
is data on the time range in which the air conditioning temperature setting has been changed.<br>
What is referred to as "data on times when the thermostat is off' is data in which the<br>
thermostat off status of the indoor units and the outdoor temperature data of the indoor units<br>
42a through 42f and 52a through 52f in which the thermostat was off throughout the day are<br>
associated on a room by room basis. The data processor 20 graphs each type of operating<br>
data stored in the memory 30 in order to be displayed in the power consumption<br>
countermeasure mode described below (there is no actual need for display output, as long as<br>
the data is appropriately processed). The keyboard 25 or mouse 26, which are input devices<br>
of the monitor device 2 or central remote control 3, can also be used for input by the user to<br>
allow power consumption countermeasures from the results analyzed in each power<br>
consumption countermeasure mode (see below) to be displayed based on the power<br>
consumption countermeasure table 22a stored in the memory 22.<br>
Various power consumption countermeasure modes will be described below. The<br>
power consumption countermeasure modes are the seven modes described below. The<br>
seven modes are illustrated in sequence using FIGS. 5 through 20. The seven modes can be<br>
selected from a countermeasure mode selection screen SC1 (see FIG. 5), which is the initial<br>
screen showing the power consumption countermeasure modes. Each button 71 through 77<br>
on the countermeasure mode selection screen SC1 can be selected to move to the screen<br>
showing the seven power consumption countermeasure modes described below.<br>
(1) Wasteful Operation Elimination Mode<br>
In the countermeasure mode selection screen SC1 (see FIG. 5), the wasteful<br>
operation elimination button 71 is selected to switch to a screen SC11 that displays power<br>
consumption classified by temperature setting. In the screen SC11 that displays power<br>
consumption classified by temperature setting, analyzed temperature setting-power<br>
consumption data is visualized as in FIG. 6, and is displayed on the display component 23.<br>
(1-1) Determination of Analysis Target Period<br>
According to the present embodiment, as noted above, the air conditioners 4 and 5<br>
have been operated for a year, and operating data has been previously stored in the memory<br>
22. The temperature setting-power consumption data is analyzed based on the data for the<br>
previous year according to the season for which the wasteful operation elimination button 71<br>
has been selected. The seasons are classified into three patterns: summer (cooling operation<br>
period), winter (heating operation period), and an interim period, where summer is the period<br>
from June to August, winter is the period that spans December, January, and February, and<br>
the interim period is the period from March to May and from September to November. The<br>
 <br>
user can also change the summer, winter, and interim periods to any period by means of an<br>
input device such as the keyboard 25 or mouse 26.<br>
When, for example, the wasteful operation elimination button 71 is selected on July<br>
20, 2006, since the season is summer, the operating data collected from June 1, 2005 to<br>
August 31, 2005 will be analyzed as part of the previous year of operating data.<br>
(1-2) Automatic Analysis and Display of Analyzed Results<br>
In the analysis of the operating data, a maximum of three indoor units are selected in<br>
order of the greatest power consumption, 42c, 42f, and 52e, from among the indoor units in<br>
which the air conditioning temperature setting of each indoor unit 42a through 42f and 52a<br>
through 52f has been set below 28°C. These are displayed along with a graph, as shown in<br>
FIG. 6. FIG. 6 is a graph in which the air conditioning temperature settings of the indoor<br>
units 42a through 42f and 52a through 52f are shown on the horizontal axis, and the power<br>
consumption is shown on the vertical axis. In the graph, the indoor unit that is highly likely<br>
to be wasting energy can be extracted because the indoor unit 42c with particularly high<br>
power consumption can be selected from among the indoor units in which the highest<br>
temperature setting is below 28°C in cooling operation; that is, the indoor units in which it is<br>
highly likely that the air conditioning temperature setting has been set too low. What is<br>
referred to here as the "highest temperature setting" is the air conditioning temperature setting<br>
that is the highest among the air conditioning temperature settings which have been set by the<br>
user. Here, the indoor unit 42c has been extracted. Although a maximum of three indoor<br>
units which the results of analysis indicate as having significant power consumption are used<br>
here, the user can specify a different number than 3, such as 1, 2, or 4, as needed. In<br>
addition, the example here is of cooling operation, but the analysis is done in the same<br>
manner for heating operation, in which case a maximum of three indoor units with an air<br>
conditioning temperature setting greater than 24°C will be selected in the order of greatest<br>
power consumption.<br>
(1-3) Countermeasure Display<br>
The countermeasure display button 81 in the lower right of the screen SC11 that<br>
displays power consumption classified by temperature setting is pressed to display a wasteful<br>
operation elimination countermeasures screen SC21 for the indoor unit 42c that has been<br>
extracted in the results of analysis (see FIG. 7). Here, the wasteful operation elimination<br>
countermeasures screen SC21 displays the message "The power consumption of the indoor<br>
unit 42c has increased because the temperature setting is low. It is recommended that the<br>
remote control temperature setting be increased." The user can therefore take specific<br>
 <br>
measures to reduce the power consumption in response to the results of analysis noted above.<br>
Not only may the above measures be taken, but maximum and minimum air conditioning<br>
temperature settings may be established to limit the air conditioning temperature settings so<br>
that no user other than the air conditioning administrator can modify the settings. The menu<br>
button 91 in the lower right of the wasteful operation elimination counter-measures screen<br>
SC21 is pushed to return to the countermeasure mode selection screen SCI.<br>
(2) Peak Power Mode<br>
In the countermeasure mode selection screen SC1, the peak power display button 72<br>
is selected to switch to a peak power screen SC12. In the peak power screen SC12, the<br>
analyzed power demand data is visualized as shown in FIG. 8 and is displayed on the display<br>
component 23.<br>
(2-1) Determination of Analysis Target Period<br>
According to the present embodiment, as noted above, the air conditioners 4 and 5<br>
have been operated for a year, and operating data has been previously stored in the memory<br>
22. The power demand data is analyzed based on the operating data for the previous year.<br>
(2-2) Automatic Analysis and Display of Analyzed Results<br>
In the analysis of the operating data, a time range T (30 minutes) in which power<br>
demand has peaked among the days with the greatest power demand peak for the first air<br>
conditioner 4 and second air conditioner 5 combined (see FIG. 9) is extracted from the<br>
operating data for the previous year. Three indoor units are extracted in the order of greatest<br>
power demand in this time range T.<br>
When, for example, the peak power countermeasure display button is selected for<br>
September 15, 2006, the day with the greatest power demand peak in the operating data in the<br>
previous year from that date is extracted. If the power demand peak was greatest on August<br>
20, 2006, then August 20, 2006 will be extracted. When the time range in which power<br>
demand peaked on August 20, 2006 was between 2:30 PM and 3:00 PM, three indoor units<br>
are extracted in the order of greatest power demand from the time range of 2:30 PM to 3:00<br>
PM on August 20, 2006.<br>
The power demand control is described here. Power demand is controlled for the<br>
indoor units 42a through 42f and 52a through 52f of the air conditioners 4 and 5 which are<br>
determined to be over a maximum power demand, and the air conditioners 4 and 5 are<br>
controlled so that the overall power demand will not be more than the maximum power<br>
demand. That is, when it appears as if the power demand will be over the maximum, the<br>
energy to the air conditioners 4 and 5 is conserved, power consumption is economized, and<br>
 <br>
the power demand is controlled so as not to be over the maximum power demand in that time<br>
range. During power demand control, the rooms in which an air conditioner is located are<br>
divided into levels by the user according to the level of need for air conditioning.<br>
According to the present embodiment, for example, room A RM11 is level 3, room B RM12<br>
is level 1, room C is level 3, and room D is level 4. The power demand is not controlled in<br>
level 1 indoor units 42d and 42e. When the power demand is controlled in the level 2<br>
indoor units (no applicable indoor units), the air conditioning temperature setting is increased<br>
1°C. When the power demand is controlled in the level 3 indoor units 42a through 42c and<br>
42f, the air conditioning temperature setting is increased 2°C. In the level 4 indoor units<br>
52a through 52f, the air conditioning temperature setting is increased 3°C. When the power<br>
demand is controlled in the level 5 indoor units (no applicable indoor units), the air<br>
conditioning temperature setting is increased 4°C. In the peak power screen SC12, the<br>
results are graphed in order of indoor units with the greatest power demand by level in the<br>
upper portion of the peak screen SC12, and the three indoor units 42c, 52e, and 52f are<br>
extracted in order of the greatest power demand in the bottom portion of the peak screen<br>
SC12.<br>
(2-3) Countermeasure Display<br>
The countermeasure display button 82 in the lower right of the peak power screen<br>
SC12 is pressed to display countermeasures for reducing the power demand in the indoor<br>
units 42c, 52e, and 52f that were extracted in the results of analysis. Here, a peak power<br>
countermeasures screen SC22 displays this message for the indoor unit 42c: "Because the<br>
power demand in the indoor unit 42c is high, it is recommended that the power demand<br>
control level in the room A be increased to level 4"; displays this message for the indoor unit<br>
52e: "Because the power demand in the indoor unit 52e is high, it is recommended that the<br>
power demand control level in room D be increased to level 5"; and displays this message for<br>
the indoor unit 52f: "Because the power demand in the indoor unit 52f is high, it is<br>
recommended that the power demand control level in room D be increased to level 5" (see<br>
FIG. 10). The user can thus take specific measures for reducing the power demand in<br>
response to the results of analysis above. The menu button 92 in the lower right of the peak<br>
power countermeasures screen SC22 is pressed to return to the countermeasure mode<br>
selection screen SC1.<br>
(3) Outdoor Air Load Determination Mode<br>
In countermeasure mode selection screen SC1, the outdoor air load determination<br>
button 73 is selected to switch to the outdoor air load determination screen SC13. In the<br>
 <br>
outdoor air load determination screen SC13, the analyzed power consumption data by<br>
outdoor temperature is visualized as shown in FIG. 11 and is displayed on the display<br>
component 23.<br>
(3-1) Determination of Analysis Target Period<br>
According to the present embodiment, as noted above, the air conditioners 4 and 5<br>
have been operated for a year, and operating data has been previously stored in the memory<br>
22. The data is analyzed based on the data for the previous year according to the season for<br>
which the outdoor air load determination button 73 has been selected. The seasons are<br>
classified into three patterns: summer (cooling operation period), winter (heating operation<br>
period), and an interim period, where summer is the period from June to August, winter is the<br>
period that spans the three months of December, January, and February, and the interim<br>
period is the period from March to May and from September to November. The outdoor air<br>
load determination mode is also a mode that is limited to summer or winter.<br>
When, for example, the outdoor air load determination button 73 is selected on July<br>
20, 2006, since the season is summer, the operating data collected from June 1, 2005 to<br>
August 31, 2005 among the previous year of data is analyzed.<br>
(3-2) Automatic Analysis and Display of Analyzed Results<br>
In the analysis of the operating data, the outdoor temperature data is associated with<br>
power consumption data for all the indoor units 42a through 42f and 52a through 52f to<br>
prepare a correlation chart such as in FIG. 11. Here, the correlation chart is produced by<br>
indicating the maximum daily temperatures throughout the period among the outdoor<br>
temperature data on the horizontal axis and the power consumption of all the indoor units 42a<br>
through 42f and 52a through 52f on the day corresponding to the highest temperature on that<br>
day on the vertical axis. When, for example, the power consumption on a certain day in the<br>
period is 100 kWh in the indoor unit 42c, and the highest air temperature on that day is 29°C,<br>
this will be plotted as shown by point A in the correlation chart. In this way, the data for all<br>
the indoor units 42a through 42f and 52a through 52f during the period is plotted in the<br>
correlation chart, and an approximate line 1 showing the trend for all the indoor units 42a<br>
through 42f and 52a through 52f is prepared from the correlation chart. A graph of the<br>
displacement in the three indoor units 42c, 42f, and 52e in the order of greatest power<br>
consumption displacement is then displayed based on the approximate line 1 showing the<br>
trend for all the indoor units 42a through 42f and 52a through 52f. Here, three indoor units<br>
for which the results of analysis are displayed were selected in order of the greatest power<br>
consumption, but the user can specify a different number than 3, such as 1, 2, or 4, as needed.<br>
 <br>
(3-3) Countermeasure Display<br>
The countermeasure display button 83 in the lower right of the outdoor air load<br>
determination screen SC13 is pressed to display an external load countermeasure screen<br>
SC23 for the indoor units 42c, 42f, and 52e that have been extracted in the results of analysis<br>
(see FIG. 12). Here, the external load countermeasure screen SC23 displays the message<br>
"The outdoor load has increased in rooms A, C, and D. It is recommended that the<br>
introduction of outdoor air be controlled or the solar radiation be suppressed." The user can<br>
thus take specific measures to reduce the external load in response to the analyzed results<br>
above. The menu button 93 in the lower right of the external load countermeasure screen<br>
SC23 is pressed to return to the countermeasure mode selection screen SC1.<br>
(4) Comfort Maintenance Mode<br>
In countermeasure mode selection screen SC1, the comfort maintenance button 74 is<br>
selected to switch to a comfort maintenance screen SC14. The analyzed change frequency<br>
data by time range (see below) is visualized on the comfort maintenance screen SC14 as<br>
shown in FIG. 13, and is displayed on the display component 23.<br>
(4-1) Determination of Analysis Target Period<br>
According to the present embodiment, as noted above, the air conditioners 4 and 5<br>
have been operated for a year, and operating data has been previously stored in the memory.<br>
The data is analyzed based on the data for the previous year according to the season for<br>
which the comfort maintenance button 74 has been selected. The seasons are classified into<br>
three patterns: summer (cooling operation period), winter (heating operation period), and an<br>
interim period, where summer is the period from June to August, winter spans the three<br>
months of December, January, and February, and the interim period is the period from March<br>
to May and from September to November.<br>
(4-2) Automatic Analysis and Display of Analyzed Results<br>
In the analysis of the operating data, change frequency data obtained by counting the<br>
number of times the air conditioning temperature settings have been changed and changed<br>
time range data from when the air conditioning temperature settings were changed are<br>
associated to prepare change frequency data by time range. Here, three indoor units 42c,<br>
42f, and 42a are extracted in order of the greatest total number of average change frequency<br>
per day and graphed. The expression "greatest number of average change frequency per<br>
day" indicates a high possibility that the air conditioning temperature settings of the indoor<br>
units 42c, 42f, and 42a have not been set to the optimum temperature. The change<br>
frequency can thus be reduced by changing the air conditioning temperature settings to the<br>
 <br>
optimum temperature. Here, the change time range involves dividing the day into the three<br>
time ranges of morning, afternoon, and evening. Morning is the time range from 8:00 AM<br>
to 11:00 AM, afternoon is the time range from 11:00 AM to 3:00 PM, and evening is the time<br>
range from 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM. The air conditioning temperature setting of the indoor unit<br>
42c has changed ten times in the morning, three times in the afternoon, and seven times in the<br>
evening. The air conditioning temperature setting of the indoor unit 42f has changed four<br>
times in the morning, 11 times in the afternoon, and three times in the evening. The air<br>
conditioning temperature setting of the indoor unit 42a has changed 14 times in the morning,<br>
and has not changed at all in the afternoon or evening.<br>
(4-3) Countermeasure Display<br>
The countermeasure display button 84 in the lower right of the comfort maintenance<br>
screen SC14 is pressed to display a comfort maintenance countermeasure screen SC24 for the<br>
indoor units 42c, 42f, and 42a extracted in the results of analysis (see FIG. 14). Here, the<br>
comfort maintenance countermeasure screen SC24 shows three patterns: pattern A for a high<br>
frequency of change in the morning and evening, pattern B for a high frequency of change in<br>
the afternoon, and pattern C for a high frequency of change in only the morning. Five or<br>
more changes in each time range are considered frequent. Although five or more changes in<br>
each time range is considered frequent here, the number of changes per time range is not<br>
limited to five or more and may be set, for example, as four or more or six or more. Pattern<br>
A is determined for the indoor unit 42c, and a message is displayed: "The change in<br>
temperature during the morning and evening is considered significant in Room A. It is<br>
recommended that the level of outside air introduced into room A be reduced." Pattern B is<br>
determined for the indoor unit 42f, and a message is displayed: "The outdoor load on Room C<br>
has increased. It is recommended that the level of outside air introduced into room C be<br>
limited or that solar radiation be controlled." Pattern C is determined for the indoor unit 42a,<br>
and a message is displayed: "The air conditioning is working too much at startup in Room A.<br>
It is recommended that the air level at startup be controlled." The display of these<br>
countermeasures allows the user to take specific measures to maintain comfort in response to<br>
the results of analysis above. The menu button 94 in the lower right of the comfort<br>
maintenance countermeasure screen SC24 is pressed to return to the countermeasure mode<br>
selection screen SC1.<br>
(5) Outdoor Air Introduction Determination Mode<br>
In the countermeasure mode selection screen SC1, the outdoor air introduction<br>
determination button 75 is selected to switch to an outdoor air introduction determination<br>
 <br>
screen SC15. The analyzed data on power consumption by outdoor temperature is<br>
visualized on the outdoor air introduction determination screen SC15 as shown in FIG. 15 and<br>
is displayed on the display component 23.<br>
(5-1) Determination of Analysis Target Period<br>
According to the present embodiment, as noted above, the air conditioners 4 and 5<br>
have been operated for a year, and operating data has been previously stored in the memory<br>
22. The data is analyzed based on the data for the previous year according to the season for<br>
which the outdoor air introduction determination button 75 has been selected. The seasons<br>
are classified into three patterns: summer (cooling operation period), winter (heating<br>
operation period), and an interim period, where summer is the period from June to August,<br>
winter spans the three months of December, January, and February, and the interim period is<br>
the period from March to May (first interim period) and from September to November<br>
(second interim period). The outdoor air introduction determination mode is a mode limited<br>
to the interim periods.<br>
When, for example, the outdoor air introduction determination button is selected on<br>
April 25, 2006, since the season is the first interim period, the operating data collected from<br>
March 1, 2005 to May 31, 2005 among the previous year of operating data is analyzed.<br>
(5-2) Automatic Analysis and Display of Analyzed Results<br>
In the analysis of the operating data, the outdoor temperature data and the power<br>
consumption data for all of the indoor units 42a through 42f and 52a through 52f are<br>
associated to prepare a correlation chart such as in FIG. 15. Here, the correlation chart is<br>
produced by indicating the maximum daily temperatures throughout the period among the<br>
outdoor temperature data on the horizontal axis and the power consumption of all the indoor<br>
units 42a through 42f and 52a through 52f on the day corresponding to the highest<br>
temperature on that day on the vertical axis. When, for example, the power consumption on<br>
a certain day in the period is 100 kWh in the indoor unit A, and the highest air temperature on<br>
that day is 29°C, this will be plotted as shown by point A in the correlation chart. In this<br>
way, the data for all the indoor units 42a through 42f and 52a through 52f during the period is<br>
plotted in the correlation chart, and an approximate line 1 showing the trend for all the indoor<br>
units 42a through 42f and 52a through 52f is prepared from the correlation chart.<br>
Approximate lines ml through ml2 showing the trends for all the indoor units 42a through<br>
42f and 52a through 52f are also prepared in the correlation chart (only m3 is shown). Here,<br>
the approximate lines ml through ml2 are prepared for the number of indoor units 42a<br>
through 42f and 52a through 52f, resulting in the preparation of the 12 approximate lines ml<br>
 <br>
through ml2 according to the present embodiment. For example, the approximate line m3<br>
for the indoor unit 42c is prepared from the correlation chart in which the power consumption<br>
data for the indoor unit 42c has been plotted. A graph of the displacement in the three<br>
indoor units 42c, 42f, and 52e in the order of greatest displacement is then displayed based on<br>
the approximate line 1 in which the approximate lines ml through ml2 show the trend for all<br>
the indoor units 42a through 42f and 52a through 52f. Here, three indoor units for which the<br>
results of analysis are displayed were selected in order of the greatest power consumption,<br>
but the user can specify a different number than 3, such as 1, 2, or 4, as needed.<br>
(5-3) Countermeasure Display<br>
The countermeasure display button 85 in the lower right of the outdoor air<br>
introduction determination screen SC15 is pressed to display an outdoor air introduction<br>
countermeasure screen SC25 for the indoor units 42c, 42f, and 52e that have been extracted<br>
in the results of analysis (see FIG. 16). Here, a message is displayed by the countermeasure<br>
display. "The internal load on room A, room, C, and room D may have increased. It is<br>
recommended that the outdoor intake level for the rooms be increased." The user can thus<br>
take specific measures to reduce the power consumption in response to the analyzed results<br>
above. The menu button 95 in the low right of the outdoor air introduction countermeasure<br>
screen SC25 is pressed to return to the countermeasure mode selection screen SC1.<br>
(6) Simultaneous Cooling/Heating Operation Energy Conservation Mode<br>
In the countermeasure mode selection screen SC1, the simultaneous cooling/heating<br>
operation optimization button 76 is selected to switch to a simultaneous cooling/heating<br>
optimization screen SC16. The analyzed cooling/heating operation mode data is visualized<br>
on the simultaneous cooling/heating optimization screen SC16 as shown in FIG. 17 and is<br>
displayed on the display component 23.<br>
(6-1) Determination of Analysis Target Period<br>
According to the present embodiment, as noted above, the second air conditioner 5<br>
has been operated for a year, and operating data has been previously stored in the memory 22.<br>
The data is analyzed based on the data for the previous year according to the season for<br>
which the simultaneous cooling/heating operation optimization button has been selected.<br>
The seasons are classified into three patterns: summer (cooling operation period), winter<br>
(heating operation period), and an interim period, where summer is the period from June to<br>
August, winter spans the three months of December, January, and February, and the interim<br>
period is the period from March to May (first interim period) and from September to<br>
November (second interim period). The simultaneous cooling/heating operation energy<br>
 <br>
conservation mode is a mode limited to the interim periods.<br>
When, for example, the simultaneous cooling/heating operation optimization button<br>
76 is selected on April 25, 2006, since the season is the first interim period, the operating data<br>
collected from March 1, 2005 to May 31, 2005 among the previous year of operating data is<br>
analyzed.<br>
(6-2) Automatic Analysis and Display of Analyzed Results<br>
In the analysis of the operating data, the simultaneous cooling/heating operation data<br>
and the power consumption data for all of the indoor units 52a through 52f of the second air<br>
conditioner 5 in the room D RM21 and all of the indoor units 52a through 52f of the second<br>
air conditioner 5 in the room E RM31 are associated to prepare a table such as in FIG. 17.<br>
In the table in FIG. 17, the group G4 and group G6 in room D RM21 are in cooling operation,<br>
and the group G5 adjacent to the groups G4 and G6 is in heating operation. In the room E,<br>
all of the groups G4 through G6 are in cooling operation. The air conditioning temperature<br>
settings of the second air conditioner 5 in the room D RM21 and the room E RM31 is 24°C.<br>
This is displayed in the graph in the lower part of the table in the order of greatest power<br>
consumption.<br>
(6-3) Countermeasure Display<br>
The countermeasure display button 96 in the lower right of the simultaneous<br>
cooling/heating operation optimization screen SC16 is pressed to display a simultaneous<br>
cooling/heating operation optimization countermeasure screen SC26 for the second air<br>
conditioner 5 in the room D RM21 which has been extracted in the results of analysis and is<br>
over the standard power consumption Wb (see FIG. 18). Here, the simultaneous<br>
cooling/heating operation optimization countermeasure screen SC26 displays the message:<br>
"Cooling and heating are operating simultaneously in room D. It is recommended that the<br>
temperature setting in room D be lowered to make the operation mode consistent with either<br>
cooling or heating." The user can thus take specific measures to reduce power consumption<br>
in response to the analyzed results above. The display returns to the countermeasure mode<br>
selection screen SC1 when the menu button 96 in the lower right of the simultaneous<br>
cooling/heating operation optimization countermeasure screen SC26 is pressed.<br>
(7) Mode for Optimizing Number of Operating Units<br>
In the countermeasure mode selection screen SC1, the button 77 for optimizing the<br>
number of operating units is selected to switch to a screen SC1 7 for optimizing the number of<br>
operating units. The analyzed data on times when the thermostat is off by outdoor<br>
temperature is visualized on the screen SC17 for optimizing the number of operating units as<br>
 <br>
shown in FIG. 19 and is displayed on the display component 23.<br>
(7-1) Determination of Analysis Target Period<br>
According to the present embodiment, as noted above, the air conditioners 4 and 5<br>
have been operated for a year, and operating data has been previously stored in the memory<br>
22. The data is analyzed based on the data for the previous year according to the season for<br>
which the button 77 for optimizing the number of operating units has been selected. The<br>
seasons are classified into three patterns: summer (cooling operation period), winter (heating<br>
operation period), and an interim period, where summer is the period from June to August,<br>
winter spans the three months of December, January, and February, and the interim period is<br>
the period from March to May (first interim period) and from September to November<br>
(second interim period). The mode for optimizing the number of operating units is a mode<br>
limited to the interim periods.<br>
When, for example, the button for optimizing the number of operating units is<br>
selected on April 25, 2006, since the season is the first interim period, the operating data<br>
collected from March 1, 2005 to May 31, 2005 among the previous year of operating data is<br>
analyzed.<br>
(7-2) Automatic Analysis and Display of Analyzed Results<br>
In the analysis of the operating data, the outdoor temperature data and the data on<br>
times when the thermostat is off for the indoor units 42a through 42f and 52a through 52f are<br>
associated to prepare a table such as in FIG. 19. In this table, the number of indoor units for<br>
which the thermostat is off all day is summarized by outdoor temperature for each room.<br>
This is displayed in the order of rooms with the greatest number of stopped units. When, for<br>
example, the outdoor temperature is 19°C as shown in FIG. 19, the thermostat is off in two of<br>
the indoor units 42a through 42c (indoor units 42a and 42b) in room A RM11, and the<br>
thermostat is off in one of the indoor units 42d and 42e in room B RM12. Although not<br>
shown in FIG. 19, the thermostat is off in none of the units in room C RM13, room D RM21,<br>
or room E RM31.<br>
(7-3) Countermeasure Control<br>
When the countermeasure button 87 in the lower right of the screen SCI7 for<br>
optimizing the number of operating units is pressed, the number of operating units is<br>
optimized for the indoor units 42a through 42c in room A RM11 extracted in the results of<br>
analysis, and the number of units is controlled by the control component 27 so that only one<br>
indoor unit (such as indoor unit 42a) is operated in room A RM11. The number of units in<br>
room B RM12 is controlled by the control component 27 in the same manner as room A<br>
 <br>
RM11 so that only one indoor unit (such as indoor unit 42d) is operated.<br>
Features<br>
(1)<br>
In the present invention, the operating data of the air conditioners 4 and 5, such as<br>
power consumption data, air conditioning temperature setting data, power demand data,<br>
outside temperature data, change frequency data, changed time range data, and data on times<br>
when the thermostat is off, is collected in the memory 22 through the communications<br>
component 24. The collected operating data is analyzed by seven power consumption<br>
countermeasure modes, and the analyzed data is visualized and displayed on the display<br>
component 23. Power consumption countermeasures which have been predetermined on the<br>
basis of the analyzed data are also displayed on the display component. The user can thus<br>
ascertain the operating status and can take specific measures to reduce the power<br>
consumption.<br>
(2)<br>
In the present invention, power consumption data and air conditioning temperature<br>
setting data retrieved via the communications component 24 are associated and collected in<br>
the memory 22 as temperature setting-power consumption data for the indoor units 42a<br>
through 42f and 52a through 52f. Based on the temperature setting-power consumption data<br>
stored in the memory 22, the data processor 21 extracts three indoor units 42c, 42f, and 52e in<br>
the order of greatest power consumption from among the indoor units in which the air<br>
conditioning temperature setting is below 28°C when in cooling operation. The temperature<br>
setting-power consumption data for the three indoor units 42c, 42f, and 52e extracted by the<br>
data processor 21 is also graphed and displayed on the display component 23. The user is<br>
also advised to increase the target temperature settings in the indoor units 42c, 42f, and 52e<br>
extracted by the data processor 21.<br>
The data processor 21 can thus extract the three indoor units 42c, 42f, and 52e in<br>
which the target temperature setting is a temperature that is so low that such a temperature<br>
cannot be recommended, and which are highly likely to be wasting energy. The power<br>
consumption and the target temperature settings of the extracted indoor units can be graphed<br>
to notify the user. The user can therefore be notified of the indoor units which are highly<br>
likely to be wasting energy, along with the operating data, leading to countermeasures for<br>
reducing power consumption. The user can also be presented with countermeasures for<br>
reducing power consumption, and not merely shown the operating data of the indoor units<br>
42c, 42f, and 52e which are highly likely to be wasting energy. This can therefore lead to<br>
 <br>
effective countermeasures for reducing power consumption, and can also alleviate the burden<br>
on the user.<br>
(3)<br>
In the present invention, power demand data retrieved via the communications<br>
component 24 is collected in the memory 22 for each indoor unit 42a through 42f and 52a<br>
through 52f. Based on the power demand data stored in the memory 22, the data processor<br>
21	calculates the peak production time in which the overall power demand has peaked in the<br>
air conditioners 4 and 5, and extracts the three indoor units 42c, 52e, and 52f in the order of<br>
greatest power demand in the peak production time. The power demand data during the<br>
peak production time for the three indoor units 42c, 52e, and 52f extracted by the data<br>
processor 21 can also be graphed and displayed on the display component 23. The user is<br>
also advised to suppress and control the power demand in the indoor units 42c, 52e, and 52f<br>
extracted by the data processor 21.<br>
The data processor 21 can thus extract the three indoor units 42c, 52e, and 52f which<br>
have substantial indoor unit power demand in the peak production time and which are highly<br>
likely to be have a significant effect on the overall power demand. The power demand data<br>
of the extracted indoor units 42c, 52e, and 52f can also be graphed to notify the user. The<br>
user can therefore be notified of the indoor units 42c, 52e, and 52f which are highly likely to<br>
have a significant effect on the overall power demand, along with the operating data, leading<br>
to countermeasures for reducing power consumption. The user can also be presented with<br>
countermeasures for reducing power consumption, and not merely shown the operating data<br>
of the indoor units 42c, 52e, and 52f which are highly likely to have a significant effect on the<br>
overall power demand. This can therefore lead to effective countermeasures for reducing<br>
power consumption, and can also alleviate the burden on the user.<br>
(4)<br>
In the present invention, power consumption data and outdoor temperature data<br>
retrieved via the communications component 24 are associated and collected in the memory<br>
22	as data on power consumption by outdoor temperature for the indoor units 42a through<br>
42f and 52a through 52f. Based on the power consumption data by outdoor temperature<br>
stored in the memory 22, the data processor 21 extracts three indoor units in order of the<br>
greatest displacement in trends for each of the indoor units 42a through 42f and 52a through<br>
52f based on the trends for all of the indoor units 42a through 42f and 52a through 52f. The<br>
displacement revealed by comparison between, first, the operating data for the three indoor<br>
units 42c, 42f, and 52e extracted by the data processor 21 and, second, the approximate line 1<br>
 <br>
showing the trends for all the indoor units is also graphed and displayed on the display<br>
component. The user is advised, for example, to lower blinds to block externally radiated<br>
heat or to lower the level of introduced outdoor air having a substantial load, so as to suppress<br>
the external load in room A RM11, room C RM13, and room D RM21 in which the indoor<br>
units 42c, 42f, and 52e extracted by the data processor 21 are set up.<br>
The data processor 21 can thus extract the three indoor units 42c, 42f, and 52e which<br>
are highly likely to be air conditioning rooms subject to substantial external load (room A<br>
RM11, room C RM13, and room D RM21). The displacement revealed by comparison<br>
between, first, the operating data for the extracted indoor units 42c, 42f, and 52e and, second,<br>
the approximate line 1 can also be graphed to notify the user. The user can therefore be<br>
notified of rooms which are highly likely to be subject to substantial external load (room A<br>
RM11, room C RM13, and room D RM21), which can lead to countermeasures for reducing<br>
power consumption. The user can also be presented with countermeasures for reducing<br>
power consumption, and not merely shown the operating data of the indoor units 42c, 42f,<br>
and 52e, which are highly likely to be air conditioning rooms that are subject to considerable<br>
external load. This can therefore lead to effective countermeasures for reducing power<br>
consumption, and can also alleviate the burden on the user.<br>
(5)<br>
In the present invention, power consumption data and outdoor temperature data<br>
retrieved via the communications component 24 are associated and collected in the memory<br>
22 as power consumption data by outdoor temperature for the indoor units 42a through 42f<br>
and 52a through 52f. Based on the power consumption data by outdoor temperature<br>
collected in the memory 22, the data processor 21 extracts three indoor units 42c, 42f, and<br>
52e in order of the greatest displacement in trends for each of the indoor units 42a through<br>
42f and 52a through 52f based on the trends for all of the indoor units 42a through 42f and<br>
52a through 52f. The displacement revealed by comparison between, first, the approximate<br>
lines ml through ml 2 representing the trends of each the three indoor units 42c, 42f, and 52e<br>
extracted by the data processor 21 and, second, the approximate line 1 showing the trends for<br>
all the indoor units is also graphed and displayed on the display component. The user is<br>
advised, for example, to increase the outdoor intake level for room A RM11, room C RM13,<br>
and room D RM21 in which the indoor units 42c, 42f, and 52e extracted by the data<br>
processor 21 are set up.<br>
The data processor 21 can thus extract the three indoor units 42c, 42f, and 52e,<br>
which are highly likely to be air conditioning rooms subject to substantial internal load (room<br>
 <br>
A RM11, room C RM13, and room D RM21). The displacement revealed by comparison<br>
between, first, the approximate lines mx representing the trends of each the three extracted<br>
indoor units 42c, 42f, and 52e and, second, the approximate line 1 can also be graphed to<br>
notify the user. The user can therefore be notified of rooms which are highly likely to be<br>
subject to substantial internal load (room A RM11, room C RM13, and room D RM21),<br>
which can lead to countermeasures for reducing power consumption. The user can also be<br>
presented with countermeasures for reducing power consumption, and not merely shown the<br>
operating data of the indoor units 42c, 42f, and 52e which are highly likely to be air<br>
conditioning rooms that are subject to considerable internal load. This can therefore lead to<br>
effective countermeasures for reducing power consumption, and can also alleviate the burden<br>
on the user.<br>
(6)<br>
In the present invention, change data and changed time range data retrieved via the<br>
communications component 24 are associated and collected in the memory 22 as change<br>
frequency data by time range for the indoor units 42a through 42f and 52a through 52f.<br>
Based on the change frequency data by time range collected in the memory 22, the data<br>
processor 21 extracts three indoor units 42c, 42f, and 42a in the order of most frequent<br>
overall changes in each of the indoor units 42a through 42f and 52a through 52f. The<br>
change frequency data by time range for the three indoor units 42c, 42f, and 42a extracted by<br>
the data processor 21 is also graphed and displayed on the display component 23. The user<br>
is also advised to, for example, lower blinds to block externally radiated heat or to lower the<br>
level of introduced outdoor air having a substantial load, so as to suppress the external load<br>
on the indoor units 42c, 42f, and 42a extracted by the data processor 21.<br>
The data processor 21 can thus extract the three indoor units 42c, 42f, and 42a in<br>
which the sensory temperature and target temperature settings are highly likely to be not<br>
matched. The change frequency data by time range for the extracted indoor units 42c, 42f,<br>
and 42a can be graphed to notify the user. The user can therefore be notified of the indoor<br>
units in which the sensory temperature and target temperature settings are highly likely to be<br>
not matched, along with the operating data, leading to countermeasures for reducing power<br>
consumption. The user can also be presented with countermeasures for reducing power<br>
consumption. This can therefore lead to effective countermeasures for reducing power<br>
consumption, and can also alleviate the burden on the user.<br>
(7)<br>
In the present invention, data on times when the thermostat is off, and outdoor<br>
 <br>
temperature data retrieved via the communications component 24, are associated and stored<br>
in the memory 22 as data on times when the thermostat is off by outdoor temperature for each<br>
of the indoor units 42a through 42f and 52a through 52f. Based on the data on times when<br>
the thermostat is off by outdoor temperature stored in the memory 22, the data processor 21<br>
displays the results in the order of rooms with the greatest number of units for which the<br>
thermostat is off by outdoor temperature. The number of indoor units is also automatically<br>
controlled by the control component 27 according to the outdoor temperature.<br>
The data processor 21 can thus extract the indoor units of rooms in which the<br>
thermostat is off for a long time and in which only air is highly likely to be blowing<br>
wastefully. The number of operating indoor units 42a through 42c in the extracted room<br>
(room A RM11) can be controlled and indoor units which are highly likely to be only blowing<br>
air wastefully can be stopped. This can therefore lead to effective countermeasures for<br>
reducing power consumption, and can also alleviate the burden on the user.<br>
Modifications<br>
Embodiments of the present invention were described on the basis of drawings, but<br>
the specific structure is not limited to these embodiments and can be modified within scope<br>
that does not depart from the spirit of the invention.<br>
(1)<br>
In the present embodiment, the air conditioners 4 and 5 were provided in a<br>
three-story building, but buildings in which the air conditioners 4 and 5 may be provided are<br>
not limited to three stories. The air conditioner monitor/support system 1 is also not limited<br>
to three air conditioning systems that can be monitored, but may be used for four systems,<br>
five systems, or the like.<br>
(2) In the wasteful operation elimination mode according to the present embodiment,<br>
the selected objects were the indoor units 42a through 42f and 52a through 52f of<br>
considerable power consumption, in which the air conditioning temperature setting was<br>
below 28°C during cooling operation, but the air conditioning temperature setting is not<br>
limited to a temperature below 28°C, and may, for example, be a temperature below 27°C or<br>
below 29°C.<br>
(3)<br>
In the mode for optimizing the number of operating units according to the present<br>
embodiment, the countermeasure button 87 in the lower right of the screen SC17 for<br>
optimizing the number of operating units is pressed to optimize the number of operating<br>
indoor units of rooms that have been extracted in the results of analysis, but the invention is<br>
 <br>
not limited to this option alone, and the countermeasure button 87 in the lower right of the<br>
screen SC17 for optimizing the number of operating units may be pressed to display a<br>
countermeasure screen SC27 for optimizing the number of operating units (see FIG. 20).<br>
Here, the countermeasure screen SC27 for optimizing the number of operating units<br>
displays a message: "The number of thermostats that are off in room A has increased. It is<br>
recommended that the operation of the indoor units in room A be stopped." This will allow<br>
the user to take specific measures to reduce power consumption in response to the above<br>
results of analysis. The menu button 97 in the lower right of the countermeasure screen<br>
SC27 for optimizing the number of operating units is pressed to return to the countermeasure<br>
mode selection screen SC1.<br>
