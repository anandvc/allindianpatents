α-DECALONES WITH DAMASCONE-WOODY ODOR<br>
Technical field<br>
The present invention relates to the field of perfumery. More particularly, it<br>
concerns a new class of compounds, a-decalones with a 2,3,8a-trimethyl substitution.<br>
Said compounds are valuable woody odorants.<br>
The present invention concerns the use of said compounds in the perfumery<br>
industry as well as the compositions or articles containing said compounds.<br>
Prior art<br>
To the best of our knowledge, none of the present compounds is known in the<br>
prior art. Their closest analogues, having an interest in perfumery, are the α-decaloncs<br>
with a 2,2,8a-trimethyl substitution (i.e a geminal substitution instead of a vicinal one)<br>
and are reported in Table 1 of US 4377714. However, in this prior art document there is<br>
no suggestion of any organoleptic properties of the compounds of formula (I), or any use<br>
of said compounds in the field of perfumery.<br>
Furthermore the odor of these prior art compounds is quite different from the one<br>
of the present invention (see below), lending thus the invention's compounds and the<br>
prior art compounds to be each suitable for different uses, i.e. to impart different<br>
organoleptic impressions.<br>
Description of the invention<br>
We have now surprisingly discovered that a compound of formula<br><br>
wherein the dotted line represents a single or double bond, R1 represents a methyl group<br>
or a hydrogen atom and R2 represents a methyl group or a hydrogen atom;<br>
can be used as perfuming ingredient, for instance to impart woody odor, together with<br>
other odor notes.<br><br>
WO 2007/031904	PCT/IB2006/053113<br>
2<br>
According to a particular embodiment of the invention, the compounds of formula<br><br>
wherein the dotted line represents a single or double bond and one R2 is a hydrogen atom<br>
and the other is a hydrogen atom or a methyl group;<br>
are particularly appreciated.<br>
According to a further embodiment of the invention, the compounds of formula<br><br>
wherein the dotted line represents a single or double bond;<br>
are also particularly appreciated.<br>
Yet, according to a particular embodiment of the invention, the perhydro-2,3,8a-<br>
tri methyl-1-naphthalenone, i.e the compound wherein the dotted line represents a single<br>
bond is particularly appreciated by the perfumers.<br>
Said compound possesses a woody note, of the vetiver type, characterized by a<br>
damascone and ionone connotation and possessing also a well perceivable watery<br>
connotation. The odor of this invention's compound is considered by the perfumers as<br>
quite unique for a synthetic compound as it marries a woody/vetiver type note, quite rare<br>
itself, with damascone-violette and watery notes providing thus a unique odor profile.<br>
When the odor of this invention's compound is compared with the one of the<br>
closest prior art compound, perhydro-2,3,8a-trimethyl-l-naphthalcnone (see the document<br>
cited above), then the invention's compound distinguishes itself by lack of at least the<br>
sweet-fruity, minty and camphor notes which are the main odor descriptors of the odor of<br>
its prior art analogue. Furthermore the; prior art compound lacks the woody-damascone<br>
character and note so typical of the invention's compound. In other works the two<br>
compounds possess different odors which lend the invention's compounds and the prior<br><br>
WO 2007/031904	PCT/IB2006/053113<br>
3<br>
art compounds to be each suitable for different uses, i.e. to impart different organojpetic<br>
impressions.<br>
The other invention's compound is the 2,3,8a-trimefhyl-3,4,4a,5,8,8a-hexahydro-<br>
l(2H)-naphfhalenonc. Said compound possesses also a woody note, of the agarwood type.<br>
The organoleptic properties of this compound differ from the ones of its closest analogue,<br>
i.e 2,2,8a-trimethyl-3,4,4a,5,8,8a-hexahydro-l(2H)-naphthalenone (US 4377714), by<br>
lacking the minty, camphor and citrus notes which are the main odor descriptors of the<br>
odor of its prior art analogue.<br>
Therefore, the present compounds of formula (III) possess different and<br>
unexpected odors from the ones of their prior art closest structural analogues.<br>
As other examples of the invention's compounds one may cite, for example,<br>
2,3,6,8a-tetramethyl-3,4,4a,5,8,8a-hcxahydro-l(2H)-naphthalenone which has a woody,<br>
ambery, patchouli odor and distinguishes itself from its closest prior art analogue (i.c<br>
2,2,5/6,8a-tetramethyl-3,4,4a,5,8,8a-hexahydro-l(2H)-naphthalenone) by having a totally<br>
different odor character.<br>
Another example is 2,2,3a,8aα-tctramethyl-3,4,4aa,5,8,8a-hexahydro-l(2H)-<br>
naphthalenone which possesses a woody aromatic, sage-laurel odor and distinguishes<br>
itself from its closest prior art analogue (i.e 2,2,8a-trimethyl-3,4,4a,5,8,8a-hexahydro-<br>
l(2H)-naphthalenone) by having a totally different odor character (e.g. no minty odor).<br>
Finally, one may cite the compound pcrhydro-2,2,3a,8aα-tetramefhyl-4aa-H-l-<br>
naphthalenone which possesses a woody aromatic, sage and slightly sulfury odor and<br>
distinguishes itself from its closest prior art analogue (i.e perhydro-2,2,8a-trimethyl-4a-H-<br>
1-naphthalenone) by having a totally different odor character (e.g. no minty odor).<br>
Therefore, also the compounds of formula (I) or (II) possess different and<br>
unexpected odors from the ones of their prior art closest structural analogues.<br>
As mentioned above, the invention concerns also the use of a compound of<br>
formula (I) as perfuming ingredient. In other words it concerns a method to confer,<br>
enhance, improve or modify the odor properties of a perfuming composition or of a<br>
perfumed article, which method comprises adding to said composition or article an<br>
effective araount of at least a compound of formula (I). ,By "use of a compound, of<br>
formula (I)" it has to be understood here also the use of any composition containing<br><br>
WO 2007/031904	PCT/IB2006/053113<br>
4<br>
compound (I) and which can be advantageously employed in the perfumery industry as,<br>
active ingredients.<br>
Said compositions, which in fact can be advantageously employed as perfuming<br>
ingrcdient, are also an object of the present invention.<br>
Therefore, another object of the present invention is a perfuming composition<br>
comprising:<br>
i) as perfuming ingredient, at least one invention's compound as defined above;<br>
ii) at least one ingredient selected from the group consisting of a perfumery carrier and a<br>
perfumery base; and<br>
iii) optionally at least one perfumery adjuvant.<br>
By "perfumery carrier" we mean here a material which is practically neutral from<br>
a perfumery point of view, i.e. that does not significantly alter the organoleptic properties<br>
of perfuming ingredients. Said carrier may be a liquid or a solid.<br>
As liquid carrier one may cite, as non-limiting examples, an emulsifying system,<br>
i.e. a solvent and a surfactant system, or a solvent commonly used in perfumery. A<br>
detailed description of the nature and type of solvents commonly used in perfumery<br>
cannot be exhaustive. However, one can cite as non-limiting example solvents such as<br>
dipropyleneglycol, diethyl phthalatc, isopropyl myristatc, benzyl benzoate, 2-(2-<br>
cthoxyethoxy)-l-ethanol or ethyl citrate, which are the most commonly used.<br>
As solid carrier one may cite, as non-limiting examples, absorbing gums or<br>
polymers, or yet "encapsulating materials. Examples of such materials, for example, may<br>
comprise wall-forming and plasticizing materials, such as mono, di- or trisaccharides,<br>
natural or modified starches, hydrocolloids, cellulose derivatives, polyvinyl acetates,<br>
polyvinylalcohols, proteins or pectins, or yet the materials cited in reference texts such as<br>
H. Scherz, Hydrokolloids: Stabilisatoren, Dickungs- und Gehermittel in Lebensmittel,<br>
Band 2 der Schriftenreihe Lebensmittclchemic, Lebensmittelqualitat, Behr's VerlagGmbH<br>
&amp; Co., Hamburg, 1996. The encapsulation is a well known process to a person skilled in<br>
the art, and may be performed, for instance, using techniques such as spray-drying,<br>
agglomeration or yet extrusion ; or consists of a coating encapsulation, including<br>
coacervation and complex coacervation techniques.<br>
Generally speaking, by "perfumery base" we mean here a composition comprising<br>
at least one perfuming co-ingredient.<br><br>
WO 2007/031904	PCT/IB2006/053113<br>
5<br>
Said perfuming co-ingredient is not of the formula (I). Moreover, by "perfuming<br>
co-ingredient" it is meant here a compound which is used in perfuming preparation or<br>
composition to impart a hedonic effect. In other words such a co-ingredient, to be<br>
considered as being a perfuming one, must be recognized by a person skilled in the art as<br>
being able to impart or modify in a positive or pleasant way the odor of a composition,<br>
and not just as having an odor.<br>
The nature and type of the perfuming co-ingredients present in the base do not<br>
warrant a more detailed description here, which in any case would not be exhaustive, the<br>
skilled person being able to select them on the basis of its general knowledge and<br>
according to intended use or application and the desired organoleptic effect. In general<br>
terms, these perfuming co-ingredients belong to chemical classes as varied as alcohols,<br>
aldehydes, ketones, esters, ethers, acetates, nitriles, terpenc hydrocarbons, nitrogenous or<br>
sulphurous heterocyclic compounds and essential oils, and said perfuming co-ingredients<br>
can be of natural or synthetic origin. Many of these co-ingredients are in any case listed in<br>
reference texts such as the book by S. Arctander, Perfume and Flavor Chemicals, 1969,<br>
Montclair, New Jersey, USA, or its more recent versions, or in other works of a similar<br>
nature, as well as in the abundant patent literature in the field of perfumery. It is also<br>
understood that said co-ingrcdients may also be compounds known to release in a<br>
controlled manner various types of pelfuming compounds.<br>
For the compositions which comprise both a perfumery carrier and a perfumery<br>
base, other suitable perfumery earners, than those previously specified, can be also<br>
ethanol, water/ethanol mixtures, limonene or other terpenes, isoparaffins such as those<br>
known under the trademark Isopar® (origin: Exxon Chemical) or glycol ethers and glycol<br>
ether esters such as those known under the trademark Dowanol® (origin: Dow Chemical<br>
Company).<br>
Generally speaking, by "perfumery adjuvant" we mean here an ingredient capable<br>
of imparting additional added benefit such as a color, a particular light resistance,<br>
chemical stability, etc. A detailed description of the nature and type of adjuvant<br>
commonly used in perfuming bases cannot be exhaustive, but it has to be mentioned That<br>
said ingredients are well known to a person skilled,in the art.<br>
An invention's composition consisting of at least one compound of formula (I)<br>
and at least one perfumery carrier represents a particular embodiment of the invention as<br><br>
WO 2007/031904	PCT/IB2006/053113<br>
6<br>
well as a perfuming composition comprising atjeast one compound of formula (I), at least<br>
one perfumery carrier, at least one perfumery base, and optionally at least one perfumery<br>
adjuvant.<br>
It is useful to mention here that the possibility to have, in the compositions<br>
mentioned above, more than one compound of formula (I) is important as it enables the<br>
perfumer to prepare accords, perfumes, possessing the odor tonality of various<br>
compounds of the invention, creating thus new tools for their work.<br>
Preferably, any mixture resulting directly from a chemical synthesis, e.g. without<br>
an adequate purification, in which the compound of the invention would be involved as a<br>
starting, intermediate or end-product could not be considered as a perfuming composition<br>
according to the invention.<br>
Furthermore, the invention's compound can also be advantageously used in all the<br>
fields of modern perfumery to positively impart or modify the odor of a consumer product<br>
into which said compound (I) is added. Consequently, a perfumed article comprising:<br>
i) as perfuming ingredient, at least one compound of formula (I), as defined above, or<br>
an invention's perfuming composition; and<br>
ii) a consumer product base ;<br>
is also an object of the present invention.<br>
' For the sake of clarity, it has to be mentioned that, by "consumer product base" we<br>
mean here a consumer product, which is compatible with perfuming ingredients. In other<br>
words, a perfumed article according to the invention comprises the functional<br>
formulation, as well as optionally additional benefit agents, corresponding to a consumer<br>
product, e.g. a detergent or an air freshener, and an olfactive effective amount of at least<br>
one invention's compound.<br>
The nature and type of the constituents of the consumer product do not warrant a<br>
more detailed description here, which in any case would not be exhaustive, the skilled<br>
person being able to select them on the basis of its general knowledge and according to<br>
the nature and the desired effect of said product.<br>
Examples of suitable consumer product bases include solid or liquid detergents<br>
and fabric softeners as well as all the other articles common in perfumery, namely<br>
perfumes, colognes or after-shave lotions, perfumed soaps, shower or bath salts, mousses,<br>
oils or gels, hygiene products or hair care products such as shampoos, body-care<br><br>
WO 2007/031904	PCT/IB2006/053113<br>
7<br>
products, deodorants or antiperspirants, air fresheners and also cosmetic preparations. As<br>
detergents there are intended applications such as detergent compositions or cleaning<br>
products for washing up or for cleaning various surfaces, e.g. intended for textile, dish or<br>
hard-surface treatment, whether they are intended for domestic or industrial use. Other<br>
perfumed articles are fabric refreshers, ironing waters, papers, wipes or bleaches.<br>
Some of the above-mentioned consumer product bases may represent an<br>
aggressive medium for the invention's compound, so that it may be necessary to protect<br>
the latter from premature decomposition, for example by encapsulation.<br>
The proportions in which the compounds according to the invention can be<br>
incorporated into the various aforementioned articles or compositions vary within a wide<br>
range of values. These values are dependent on the nature of the article to be perfumed<br>
and on the desired organoleptic effect as well as the nature of the co-ingrcdicnts in a<br>
given base when the compounds according to the invention are mixed with perfuming co-<br>
ingredients, solvents or additives commonly used in the art.<br>
For example, in the case of perfuming compositions, typical concentrations are in<br>
the order of 0.001 % to 25 % by weight, or even more, of the compounds of the invention<br>
based on the weight of the composition into which they are incorporated. Concentrations<br>
lower than these, such as in the order of 0.01% to 10% by weight, can be used when these<br>
compounds are incorporated into perfumed artictes, percentage being relative to the<br>
weight of the article.<br>
The invention will now be described in further detail by way of the following<br>
examples, wherein the abbreviations have the usual meaning in the art, the temperatures<br>
are indicated in degrees centigrade (°C); the NMR spectral data were recorded in CDCl3<br>
(if not stated otherwise) with a 360 or 400 MHz machine for 1H and 13C, the chemical<br>
displacements 5 are indicated in ppm with respect to TMS as standard, the coupling<br>
constants J are expressed in Hz.<br>

II) General procedure for the hydrogenation of the naphthalenone into the perhydro<br>
naphthalenone<br>
In a 100 ml flask were introduced the appropriate naphthalenone, ethyl acetate and<br>
10% w/w, relative to the naphthalenone, of Pd/C 5%. The mixture was thus stirred<br>
under H2, at room temperature, until consumption of the theoretical amount of<br>
hydrogen. Afterwards, the reaction mixture was filtered over Nylon 6/6. Evaporation<br>
of the solvents and distillation provided the end product.<br>
- perhydro-2,2,3a,8aα-tetramethyl-4aa-H-l-naphthalenone:<br>
Prepared	from	2,2,3,8A-Tetramethyl-3,4,4A,5,8,8A-hexahydro-l(2H)-<br>
naphthalenone in a yield of about 98%.<br>

The addition of 700 parts by weight of perhydro-2,3,8a-trimethyl-l-naphthalcnone to the<br>
above-described Eau de toilette imparted to the fragrance of the latter a nice and strong<br>
woody-damascone aspect while boosting the freshness of the scent. Furthermore, this<br>
fresh woody-damascony note was well perceivable up to the bottom notes, effect not<br>
obtainable by the addition of the known synthetic perfuming ingredients known as having<br>
a woody character.<br>
The addition of the same amount of pcrhydro-2,2,8a-trimethyl-l-naphthalcnone imparted<br>
a much weaker effect, devoid of the damascone, watery fresh effect. The overall<br>
impression was that of a much drier and heavy fragrance with a minty note and a<br>
patchouli-classic under note having a poor volume.<br><br>
