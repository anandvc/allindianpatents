INTRODUCTION<br>
Present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of N-methyl-1-naphthalenemethanamine. N-methyl-1-naphthalenemethanamine prepared by the process of the present invention having formula I given below is an intermediate used in the synthesis of (E)-N-(6,6-dimethyl-2-hepten-4-ynyl)-N-methyl-l-naphthalenemethan-amine of formula II (also known as terbinafme). Terbinafine is a fungistatic antimycotic. Terbinafme    blocks    ergosterol    synthesis    by    squalene    epoxidase    inhibition,<br><br>
effects fungicidally upon dermatophytes, yeasts, dimorphous fungi and micromycetes. It has a very good passage into adipose tissue (skin and nails).<br>
The invention also relates to a novel intermediate and a process for its preparation<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
In the literature only four processes are known for the preparation of compound of formula I. In the first procedure reported in J. Am. Chem. Soc, 1943, 65, 1984-92, 1-chloromethylnaphthalene is reacted with methylamine in a conventional maimer to get the required compound of formula I. No details about yield, conditions, and quality are given in this publication.<br>
In the second procedure reported in J. Chem. Soc, 1966, page 1573-9, 1 -chloromethylnaphthalene is reacted with a large excess of methylamine in benzene in a closed flask to get the required compound of formula I (shown in Scheme-I). The related bis-alkylated  impurity  of formula  IV   formed  in  the   reaction  was  removed  by<br><br>
hydrochloride salt formation and repeated extraction into ether. No yield and purity data for the required product was given in this publication.<br>
Such a process needs to be thoroughly studied before utilizing it for commercial production. Also, the level of related impurity may be very critical in certain cases.<br><br>
In the third procedure which is reported in J. Med. Chem. 1981, —, 141, a process for the preparation of compound of formula I is described starting from naphthalene-1-carboxaldehyde (shown in Scheme-II). In this process Naphthalene-1-carboxaldehyde is reacted with methylamine in the presence of platinum-on-carbon under hydrogenation conditions to get the compound of formula I.<br><br>
The main drawback in this process is the preparation of naphthalene-1-carboxaldehyde. Naphthalene-1 -carboxaldehyde   is   prepared   in   a   five-step   process   starting   from<br><br>
naphthalene (scheme-II). Naphthalene is reacted with formaldehyde and hydrochloric acid to get 1-chloromethylnaphthalene. 1-Chloromethylnaphthalene is reacted with hexamine and hydrolyzed to get crude naphthalene-1-carboxaldehyde. This crude compound is treated with sodium bisulfite to get the bisulfite adduct of naphthalene-1-carboxaldehyde. Isolated bisulfite adduct is hydrolyzed with acid or base to get the purified naphthalene-1-carboxaldehyde, which is further purified by high vaccum distillation.<br>
Therefore such a lengthy process for the preparation of compound of formula I is not economically viable on a commercial scale. Another disadvantage of the process is it involves high-pressure hydrogenation with platinum-on-carbon. Handling of hydrogen gas and special equipment like high-pressure hydrogenator is always risky on a commercial scale. Such process needs to be avoided wherever it is possible.<br>
In the fourth procedure, which is disclosed in the US pat. 4,282,251, l-chloromethyl-naphthalene is reacted with ethanolic methylamine to get the required compound of formula I. The basic chemistry involved in this process is similar to the one given in the second procedure given above. Therefore establishing the process on commercial scale is not easy and the drawbacks are the same as discussed earlier. In this patent no yield and quality of the required product has been mentioned.<br>
Keeping in view of the difficulties in commercialization of the above-mentioned processes for the preparation of compound of formula I, and recognizing the importance of this compound as an important intermediate in the synthesis of terbinafine, we aimed to develop a simple and economical process for the preparation of the compound of formula I.<br>
We observed that a simple and economical process for the preparation of compound of formula I may be by (a) avoiding the usage of costly raw material like naphthalene-1-carboxaldehyde, (b) avoiding formation of by-products, (c) using readily and easily available raw materials (d) developing a process, which can be suitable for any scale of<br><br>
manufacture and (e) avoiding the usage of hydrogenation chemistry which requires special handling and costly reagents.<br>
We felt that such an approach would meet the requirements of the costs, safety, and ecology in the process for the preparation of compound of formula I<br>
Accordingly we developed an improved process for the preparation of compound of formula I, which is illustrated in the Scheme-Ill given below:<br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an improved process for the preparation of N-methyl-1-naphthalenemethanamine of formula I, useful for the preparation of antifungal terbinafme of formula II,<br><br>
which comprises :<br>
i) Generating the anion of N-methylformamide with a strong base in N,N-dimethylformamide and/or a non-polar solvent and reacting this anion with 1-chloromethylnaphthalene of the formula III,<br><br><br>
ii) Hydrolyzing the resulting formamide derivative of formula VI using an acid or base to get the crude corresponding secondary amine of the formula I,<br><br>
iii) Purifying the resulting crude N-methyl-1-naphthalenemethanamine of formula I by acid / base treatment,<br>
iv) Extracting the purified base into a solvent and distilling the solvent to get the purified compound of formula I.<br>
Generating the anion of N-methylformamide and reacting this anion with an alkyl halide is novel and applied for the first time for the preparation of compound of formula I.<br>
Alternatively, the compound of formula VI can be prepared by reacting N-methylformamide (without generating the anion separately) and 1-chloromethyl-naphthalene together in the presence of a mild base and a phase transfer catalyst to get the required tertiary amide of formula VI.<br><br>
The 1-chloromethylnaphthalene of formula III can be readily prepared from naphthalene by following the known procedure (Org. Synth. Coll. Vol. IV, pl95). The amide of formula VI can be easily hydrolyzed by acid or base to get the compound of formula I free from a tertiary amine.<br>
In a preferred embodiment compound of formula III is reacted with the anion of N-methylformamide (generated by using a strong base) in the presence of a non-polar solvent at an ambient or elevated temperature to get the formamide of formula VI. The strong base used to generate the anion can be butyl lithium, lithium diisopropylamide, sodium amide, lithium amide, sodium hydride, potassium t-butoxide, etc. The mild base used in the direct reaction can be selected from sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, potassium bicarbonate, sodium methoxide, etc. The reaction can be done at a temperature in the range of 20-80°C. The phase transfer catalyst used in the process can be a quatemary ammonium salt like, tetra-n-butylammonium bromide or iodide, benzyltrimethylammonium chloride, bromide, or iodide, etc. The non-polar solvent used in the process can be selected from benzene, toluene, xylene, cyclohexane, heptane, etc.<br>
The hydrolysis of compound of formula VI can be done either with an acid or with a base. For the acid hydrolysis method aqueous sulfuric acid with or without acetic acid may be used. For the alkaline hydrolysis, base can be sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide and the medium of the reaction can be water or aqueous alcoholic solvent like methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, etc. The required product of formula I can be purified by acid/base workup and later on by high vaccum distillation.<br>
The invention also provides novel compound of formula VI and novel processes for its preparation.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for the preparation of novel compound of formula VI, which comprises:<br><br>
Generating the anion of N-methylformamide with a strong base in N,N-dimethylformamide and/or a non-polar solvent and reacting this anion with 1-chloromethylnaphthalene of formula III,<br><br>
Alternatively, the compound of the formula VI can be prepared by reacting N-methylformamide (without generating the anion separately) and 1 -chloromethylnaphthalene together in the presence of a mild base and a phase transfer catalyst to get the required tertiary amide of the formula VI.<br>
