The invention relates to novel pyrimidine-4,6-dicarboxylic acid diamides and to their use for selectively inhibiting collagenase (MMP 13). The pyrimidine-4,6-dicarboxylic acid diamides can therefore be used for treating degenerative joint diseases.<br>
It is known that pyrimidine-4,6-dicarboxylic acid diamides and 2,4-substituted pyridine N-oxides inhibit the enzymes proline hydroxylase and ysine hydroxylase and thereby bring about an inhibition of collagen piosynthesis by exerting an influence on the collagen-specific hydroxylation eaction (EP 0418797; EP 0463592). This inhibition of collagen piosynthesis results in the formation of a nonfunctional, under-hydroxylated collagen molecule which the cells can only release into the extracellular space in small quantity. In addition, the under-hydroxylated collagen cannot be incorporated into the collagen matrix and is very readily degraded proteolytically. As a consequence of these effects, the overall quantity of collagen which is deposited extracellularly decreases. It is known from &gt;atent applications WO 02/064571 and WO 02/064080 that certain hyridine-2,4-dicarboxylic acid diamides and pyrimidine-4,6-dicarboxylic acid liamides can be allosteric inhibitors of MMP 13.<br>
1 diseases such as osteoarthritis and rheumatism, destruction of the joint<br>
akes place, with this destruction being caused, in particular, by the<br>
roteolytic breakdown of collagen due to collagenases.  Collagenases<br>
elong to the metalloproteinase (MP) or matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)<br>
uperfamily.   Under  physiological   conditions,   MMPs  cleave   collagen,<br>
aminin, proteoglycans, elastin or gelatin and therefore play an important<br>
bie in bone and connective tissue. A large number of different inhibitors of<br>
be MMPs and/or collagenases have been disclosed (EP 0 606 046; WO<br>
4/28889). Known MMP inhibitors frequently suffer from the disadvantage<br>
f lacking the specificity involved in inhibiting only one class of MMPs. As a<br>
result, most MMP inhibitors inhibit several MMPs simultaneously because<br>
the structure of the catalytic domain  in the  MMPs is similar. As a<br>
consequence, the inhibitors have the undesirable property of acting on<br>
many enzymes, including those which have a vital function (Massova I., et<br>
al.. The FASEB Journal (1998) 12,1075-1095).<br><br>
In an endeavor to find effective compounds for treating connective tissue diseases, it has now been found that the compounds which are employed in accordance with the invention are powerful inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinase 13 while essentially having no effect on MMPs 3 and 8.<br><br>

Michael Murray showed that compounds which contain an unsubstituted benzo[1,3]dioxole ring as a radical inhibit the cytochrome P450 liver enzymes (Michael Murray, Current Drug Metabolism 2000, 67-84). Said radical is held to be responsible for these significant toxicological effects. For this reason, it has been excluded in the compounds of the formula I.<br>

The tenn "halogen" is understood as meaning fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine.<br>
The term "alkyl" is understood as meaning, in the widest possible sense, hydrocarbon radicals whose carbon chain is straight-chain or branched or which are composed of cyclic hydrocarbon groups or of combinations of linear and cyclic groups. For example, linear and branched hydrocarbon radicals can be methyl, ethyl, propyl, i-propyl, butyl, tert-butyl, pentyl or hexyl, while cyclic groups can be cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl or cyclohexyl and a combination of linear and cyclic radicals can be cyclopropylmethyl, cyclobutylmethyl or cyclopentylmethyl. However, alkyl<br><br>

In the bicyclic Het, two rings can be linked to each other, with it being possible for one of the rings to be a 5-membered or 6-membered heterocyclic ring and the other to be a 5- or 6-membered heterocyclic or carbocyclic ring. A bicyclic Het group can be composed, for example, of 8, 9 or 10 ring atoms. Het comprises saturated heterocyclic ring systems which do not possess any double bond in the rings and also unsaturated heterocyclic ring systems, including monounsaturated and polyunsaturated heterocyclic ring systems, which possess one or more double bonds and form a stable ring<br><br>

reacting a compound of the formula II with a compound of the formula Illa or lllb to give a compound of the formula IVa or IVb<br><br><br>
where R1 to R7 have the meanings given in formula I and Y is halogen, hydroxyl or C1-C4-alkoxy or, together with the carbonyl group, forms an active ester or a mixed anhydride, and purifying the compound of the formula IVa or IVb, where appropriate, and then converting it, with a compound of the formula Ilia or lllb, into a compound of the formula I.<br>
The preparation of compounds according to formula I, and the preparation of the starting substances which are required for this purpose, insofar as the substances are not commercially available, is described in more detail below.<br>
The compounds according to the invention are most readily prepared by mixing the two components, i.e. the pyrimidine derivative according to formula (II) and the amine according to formula Ilia or lllb, in equimolar quantities and reacting them, at temperatures of between -rrSQfJC and 150°(X-Preferably at from 20°C to 100!C.JQ.5ive compound of the formula IVa or IVb and then reacting the compounds of the formula IVa or IVb, in an analogous manner, withup to an equimolar quantity of amine according to formula lllb or Ilia. The end of the reaction can be determined, for example, tDy means of thin layer chromatography or HPLC-MS. A variant of this method comprises carrying out the reaction in a suitable solvent, such as diethyl ether, dimethoxyethane or tetrahydrofuran, chlorinated hydrocarbons, such as methylene chloride, chloroform, trichloroethylene or tetrachloroethylene, benzene or toluene, or else polar solvents such as dimethylformamide, acetone or dimethyl sulfoxide. In this case, the reaction temperatures are between room temperature and the boiling point of the solvent, with temperatures in the range from room temperature to 130°C being particularly preferred.<br><br>
The reaction can also take place by way of a mixed anhydride, such as ethyl chloroformate, or by way of an active ester, such as paranitrophenyl ester (Y = CICH2-COO or NO2-C6H4-O). Appropriate methods are known and described in the literature.<br>
A compound of the formula II or a compound of the formula IVa or IVb can also react with an amine of the formula Ilia or lllb if Y is OH and the corresponding carboxylic acid Is activated in situ using customary coupling reagents. Examples of these coupling reagents are carbodiimides, such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) or diisopropylcarbodiimide (DCI), or N,N'-carbonyldiazoles, such as N,N'-carbonyldiimidazole, or a uronium salt, such as 0-((cyano(ethoxycarbonyl)methylene)amino)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyl-uronium tetrafluoroborate (TOTU) or 0-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HATU). Appropriate methods are known.<br>
If amines of the formula Ilia or lllb are not commercially available, they can be prepared from appropriate commercially available starting compounds using methods known from the literature. Examples of suitable starting compounds for amines are nitriles, nitro compounds, carboxamides, carboxylic acid esters, carboxylic acids, aldehydes and bromides. Nitriles, nitro compounds and carboxamides can be reduced to amines using known methods. Carboxylic acids and carboxylic acid esters can be converted into the carboxamides. Aldehydes can be converted directly into the amines by way of reductive amination using NH4Ac/NaBH4, or else initially converted into the oximes using hydroxylamine and then converted into the amines by reduction.<br>
Where appropriate, the reaction can also take place in the presence of bases. Examples of suitable additional bases are carbonates or hydrogen carbonates, such as sodium carbonate or potassium carbonate or sodium hydrogen carbonate or potassium hydrogen carbonate, or tertiary amines, such as triethylamine, tributylamine or ethyl diisopropylamine, or heterocyclic amines, such as N-alkylmorpholine, pyridine or quinoline, or dialkylanilines.<br>
Where appropriate, the products, in particular the compound of the formula IVa or IVb, can be worked up, for example, by extraction or chromatography, e.g. through silica gel. The isolated product can be<br><br>
recrystallized and, where appropriate, reacted with a suitable acid to give i physiologically tolerated salt. Examples of suitable acids are: mineral acids, such as hydrochloric acid and hydrobromic acid and aisc sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, nitric acid and perchloric acid, or organic acids, such as formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, succinic acid, glycolic acid, lactic acid, malic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, maleic acid, fumaric  acid,   phenylacetic  acid,   benzoic  acid,   methanesulfonic  acid, toluenesulfonic  acid,   oxalic  acid,   4-aminobenzoic  acid,   naphthalene-1,5-disulfonic acid or ascorbic acid.<br>
Insofar as they are not commercially available, the starting compounds of the formula Ilia or lllb can be synthesized readily (e.g. Organikum, Organisch Chemisches Grundpraktikum [Organicum, basic practical course in organic chemistry], 15th Edition, VEB Deutscher Verlag der Wissenschaften, 1976; an overview of the different possibilities can be found on p. 822 in the methods index).<br>
The starting compounds of the fonnula (II) are obtained, for example, by using methods which are known from the literature to convert pyrimidine-4,6-dicarboxylic acid into the corresponding pyrimidine-4,6-dicarbonyl halide, preferably dicarbonyl chloride, preferably in the presence of a catalyst such as dimethylformamide. This acid halide can then, for example, be reacted either with a suitable alcohol, for example paranitrobenzyl alcohol, to give the corresponding active ester or else with lower alcohols, such as methanol or ethanol, to give the corresponding esters. The pyrimidine-4,6-dicarboxylic acid can also initially be converted, in the added presence of a suitable carboxylic acid or of a carboxylic acid ester such as ethyl chloroformate, into a mixed anhydride, which is then reacted with the amines of the compound of the formulae Ilia or lllb and IVa or IVb to give the products according to the invention. An appropriate method is likewise described in the literature.<br>
The pyrimidine-4,6-dicarboxylic acid is prepared using methods known from the literature, for example by oxidizing 4,6-dimethylpyrimidine which, for its part, can be obtained, for example, by the catalytic hydrogenation of commercially available 2-mercapto-4,6-dimethylpyrimidine.<br>
Insofar as compounds of the formula I permit diastereoisomeric or enantiomeric forms and accrue as their mixtures in the synthesis which is<br><br>
selected, separation into the pure stereoisomers is achieved either by chromatography on an optionally chirai support material or, provided the racemic compound of the formula I is capable of salt formation, by fractionally crystallizing the diastereomeric salts which are formed using an optically active base or acid as auxiliary substance. Examples of suitable chirai stationary phases for the thin-layer or column chromatographic separation of enantiomers are modified silica gel supports (what are termed Pirkle phases) and also high molecular weight carbohydrates, such as triacetyl cellulose. Following appropriate derivatization, which is known to the skilled person, gas-chromatographic methods on chirai stationary phases can also be used for analytical purposes. In order to separate the enantiomers of the racemic carboxylic acids, the diastereomeric salts, which differ in solubility, are formed using an optically active, as a rule commercially available, base such as (-)-nicotine, (+)- and (-)-phenylethylamine, quinine bases, L-lysine or L- and D-arginine, the more sparingly soluble component is isolated as a solid, the more readily soluble diastereomer is separated out from the mother liquor, and the pure enantiomers are isolated from the diastereomer salts which have been obtained in this way. The racemic compounds of the formula I which contain a basic group, such as amino group, can, in what is in principle the same manner, be converted Into the pure enantiomers using optically active acids, such as (+)-camphor-10-sulfonic acid, D- and L-tartaric acid, D- and L-lactic acid and (+) and (-)-mandelic acid. Chirai compounds which contain alcohol or amine functions can also be converted into the corresponding esters or amides using appropriately activated or optionally N-protected enantiomerically pure amino acids or, conversely, chirai carboxylic acids can be converted into the amides using carboxyl-protected enatiomerically pure amino acids or into the corresponding chirai esters using enantiomerically pure hydroxyl carboxylic acids such as lactic acid. The chirality of the amino acid or alcohol radical which has been introduced in enantiomerically pure form can then be used for separating the isomers by the diastereomers, which are now present, being separated by means of crystallization or chromatography on suitable stationary phases and, after that, using suitable methods to once again eliminate the entrained chirai molecule moiety.<br>
Acidic or basic products of the compound of the formula I may be present in the form of their salts or in free form. Preference is given to pharmacologically tolerated salts, e.a. alkali metal salts or alkaline earth<br><br>
metal salts or hydrochlorides, hydrobromides, sulfates, hemisulfates, all possible phosphates and also salts of the amino acids, natural bases or :arboxylic acids.<br>
Physiologically tolerated salts are prepared in a manner known per se from :ompounds of the formula I, including their stereoisomeric forms, which are capable of salt formation. The carboxylic acids form stable alkali metal salts, alkaline earth metal salts or optionally substituted ammonium salts with basic reagents such as hydroxides, carbonates, hydrogen carbonates, alkoxides and ammonia or organic bases, for example trimethylamine, triethylamine, ethanolamine or triethanolamine, or else basic amino acids, for example lysine, ornithine or arginine. Insofar as the compounds of the formula I possess basic groups, stable acid addition salts can also be prepared using strong acids. Both inorganic and organic acids, such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, methanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, 4-bromobenzenesulfonic acid, cyclohexylamidosulfonic acid, trifluoromethylsulfonic acid, acetic acid, oxalic acid, tartaric acid, succinic acid and trifluoroacetic acid are suitable for this purpose.<br>
As a result of their pharmacological properties, the compounds of the formula I are suitable for the prophylaxis and therapy of all those diseases in whose course an increase in the activity of matrix metalloproteinase 13 is involved.<br>
These diseases include degenerative joint diseases, such as osteoarthroses, spondyloses or cartilage loss following joint trauma or a relatively long period of joint immobilization following meniscus injuries or patella injuries or ligament rupture. They also include diseases of the connective tissue such as collagenoses, periodontal diseases, wound healing disturbances and chronic diseases of the locomotory apparatus, such as inflammatory, immunologically detemriined or metabolism-determined, acute and chronic arthritides, arthropathies, myalgias and disturbances of bone metabolism or cancer diseases such as breast cancer.<br>
The pharmaceuticals according to the invention can be administered by subcutaneous,   intraarticular,   intraperitoneal   or   intravenous   injection.<br><br>
Intraarticular injection is preferred. Rectal, oral, inhalative or transdermal administration is also possible.<br>
The invention also relates to a process for producing a pharmaceutical, wherein at least one compound of the formula I is brought, together with a pharmaceutically suitable and physiologically tolerated carrier and, where appropriate, other suitable active compounds, additives or auxiliary substances, into a suitable form for administration.<br>
The compounds of the formula I are mixed with the additives, such as carrier substances, stabilizers or inert diluents, which are suitable for the purpose and brought into suitable administration forms, such as tablets, sugar-coated tablets, hard gelatine capsules, aqueous, alcoholic or oily suspensions or aqueous or oily solutions, using the customary methods. The examples of inert carrier substances which can be used are gum Arabic, magnesium oxide, magnesium carbonate, potassium phosphate, lactose, glucose or starch, in particular corn starch. In this connection, the preparation can be effected either as dry granules or as wet granules. The examples of suitable oily carrier substances or solvents are vegetable or animal oils, such as sunflower oil or cod liver oil.<br>
For subcutaneous, intraarticular, intraperitoneal or intravenous administration, the active compounds are, if desired, brought into solution, suspension or emulsion using the substances which are suitable for this purpose, such as solubilizers, emulsifiers or other auxiliary substances. Examples of suitable solvents are physiological sodium chloride solution or alcohols, e.g. ethanol, propanol or glycerol, and, in addition, sugar solutions, such as solutions of glucose or mannitol, or else a mixture which is composed of the different solvents mentioned.<br>
Customary adjuvants, such as carrier substances, disintegrants, binding agents, coating agents, swelling agents, glidants or lubricants, flavorings, sweeteners and solubilizers are also used. Auxiliary substances which are frequently employed and which may be mentioned are magnesium carbonate, titanium dioxide, lactose, mannitol and other sugars, talc, milk protein, gelatine, starch, cellulose and its derivatives, animal and vegetable oils, such as cod liver oil, sunflower oil, peanut oil or sesame seed oil, polyethylene glycol and solvents such as sterile water and monohydric or polyhydric alcohols, such as glycerol.<br><br>
The compounds of the formula I are preferably prepared as pharmaceutical preparations and administered in dosage units, with each unit containing a defined dose of the compound of the fonnula I as the active constituent. For this purpose, the compounds of the formula I can be administered orally in doses of from 0.01 mg/kg/day to 25.0 mg/kg/day, preferably from 0.01 mg/kg/day to 5.0 mg/kg/day, or parenterally in doses of from 0.001 mg/kg/day to 5 mg/kg/day, preferably of from 0.001 mg/kg/day to 2.5 mg/kg/day. The dosage can also be increased in severe cases. However, smaller doses are also adequate in many cases. These figures relate to the treatment of an adult.<br>

collagenase 3 (MMP-13).<br>
This protein is obtained as an inactive proenzyme from INVITEK, Berlin (Catalogue No. 30 100 803). Activating the proenzyme: 2 parts by volume of proenzyme are incubated with 1 part by volume of APMA solution at 37°C for 1.5 hours. The APMA solution is prepared from a 10mmol/L solution of p-aminophenylmercuric acetate in 0.1 mmol/L NaOH by diluting with 3 parts by volume of tris/HCI buffer, pH 7.5 (see below). The pH is adjusted to between 7.0 and 7.5 by adding 1 mmol/L HCI. After the enzyme has been activated, it is diluted to a concentration of 1.67 |ig/ml using the tris/HCI buffer.<br>
In order to measure the enzyme activity, 1G|aL of enzyme solution are incubated for 15 minutes with 10|iL of a 3% (v/v) buffered solution of dimethyl sulfoxide (reaction 1). In order to measure the enzyme inhibitor activity, 10 ^L of enzyme solution are incubated with 10 ^L of a 3% (v/v) buffered solution of dimethyl sulfoxide containing the enzyme inhibitor (reaction 2).<br>
In the case of both reaction 1 and reaction 2, the enzyme reaction is monitored by fluorescence spectroscopy (328 nm (extinction)/393 nm (emission)) after adding 10 i^L of a 3% (v/v) aqueous solution of dimethyl sulfoxide containing 0.75 mmol of the substrate/L.<br>
The enzyme activity is depicted as increase in extinction/minute.<br>
The effect of the inhibitor is calculated as a percentage inhibition using the<br>
following formula:<br>
% inhibition = 100 - [(increase in extinction/minute in reaction 2)/(increase<br>
in extinction/minute in reaction 1) x 100].<br>
The IC50, i.e. the inhibitor concentration which is required for inhibiting the<br>
enzyme   activity  by  50%,   is  determined  graphically  by  plotting  the<br>
percentage inhibitions at different inhibitor concentrations.<br>
The buffer solution contains 0.05% Brij (Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany)<br>
and<br>
0.1 mol of tris/HCI/L, 0.1 mol of NaCI/L and 0.01 mol of CaCl2/L (pH = 7.5).<br>

Determining the enzyme activity of the catalytic domain of human neutrophil collagenase (MMP-8) and of human Stromelysin (MMP-3).<br>
The [lacuna] enzymes human neutrophil collagenase and human Stromelysin, prepared as active catalytic domains, were carried out as described in Weithmann et al Inflamm Res, 46 (1997), pages 246-252. The measurement of the enzyme activity, and the determination of the inhibitory<br><br>
effect of inhibitors on the enzyme activity, were also carried out as described in that publication.<br>
when determining human neutrophil collagenase and human Stromelysin, he compounds described in the above examples in each case had IC50 alues of more than 100 000 nM. These compounds are therefore virtually vithout activity as regards inhibiting MMP 3 and 8.<br><br><br>
