CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/746,079, filed May 1,2006<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to compositions comprising cross linked silicone copolymer networks where the cross links are acrylate oligomers or polymers, methods of making the compositions and uses for the compositions.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] The personal care industry thrives on being able to deliver multiple performance products based on mixtures of several components, with each having performance characteristics important to or desirable in the final formulation. One desirable characteristic is the ability to provide a silky initial feel derived from low molecular weight silicones, such as for example, octamethylcyclotetrasilioxane or decamethylcyclopentasiloxane, in the formulation while maintaining a high, but shear-thinnable viscosity. While these low molecular weight silicones provide the desired feel characteristics, they are also low viscosity, highly flowable liquids. Thus they are not easily held in a formulation, preferring rather to separate and flow out of a given container or flow uncontrollably across the skin when used in a specific application. Further, it desirable to achieve an initial silky feel while providing a smooth, low-residue feel upon dry-down. Polymeric silicone gels prepared in volatile silicone have been found to deliver desirable initial feel of volatile, low viscosity silicones to formulations while at the same time provide high viscosity and a smooth silky feel on dry-down, see for example, US Patent Nos.5,760,116, 5,493,041 and 4,987,169.<br><br>
[0003] Such polymeric silicone gels have typically been made by the hydrosilylation reaction, which requires the use of both SiH functional groups and terminal olefinic groups to form crosslinked siloxane polymers. Thus only siloxane structures that can incorporate silylhydride groups and optionally, vinyl functional siloxane groups, can be utilized in making these materials. Further this method of generating crosslinked siloxane polymers limits the range of desirable organofunctional groups that may be incorporated into the polymeric structure to create additional performance advantages in complex formulations. Thus attempts to include organofiinctional groups into the crosslinked siloxane polymer include unsaturated organic groups compatible with the hydrosilylaton reaction.<br>
[0004] US patents 6,313,249; 6,399,081; and 5,039,761 disclose a method for the preparation of a silicone-grafted acrylic copolymer that consists of an acrylic backbone and a polysiloxane side chain. US patent 6,207,782) discloses free-radical polymerized acrylates/methacrylates of polyether-terminated polysiloxanes and emulsions including these polymers. US patent 4,293,678) discloses a class of materials termed acrylated epoxy silicones that are made from an epoxy silicone and acrylic acid which include a polyether-substituted silicone.<br>
[0005] Silicone network polymers are widely used as components of various personal care compositions. However, most of these silicone network polymers are not compatible with polar media such as water. Therefore, there is a need in personal care for hydrophilic silicone networks that are compatible with a wide range of polar or non-polar media and which can provide performance benefits such as emulsification, thickening, adhesion, gloss, durability and detackification of hydrophilic actives.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0007] As used herein, integer values of stoichiometric subscripts refer to molecular species and non-integer values of stoichiometric subscripts refer to a mixture of molecular species on a molecular weight average basis, a number average basis or a mole fraction basis.   The phrases sub-stoichiometric and super stoichiometric refer to<br><br>
relationships between reactants. Sub stoichiometric refers to a quantity of reactant that is less than the quantity of reactant required for full stoichiometric reaction of a substrate moiety with that reactant. Super stoichiometric refers to a quantity of reactant that is more than that quantity of reactant required for full stoichiometric reaction of a substrate moiety with that reactant. As used herein "super stoichiometric" can under some circumstances be equivalent to an excess that is either a stoichiometric excess, i.e. a whole number multiple of a stoichiometric quantity, or a non-stoichiometric excess.<br>
[0008] The present invention provides for a method of making the compositions of the present invention, compositions and useful compositions comprising the composition of the invention.<br>
[0009] The method of the present invention provides for reacting a silyl hydride copolymer with sub-stoichiometric quantities of an olefinic polyether under hydrosilylation conditions to yield a polyether substituted hydride terpolymer.<br>
[0010] Thus in one specific embodiment, the process of the invention leading to compositions of the invention is as follows, a silyl hydride having the formula:<br>
MaMHbDcDHd,<br>
where<br>
M= R1R2R3SiOi/2;<br>
MH = R4R5HSiOl/2;<br>
D = R6R7SiO2/2;and<br>
DH = R8HSiO2/2<br>
with R1 R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, R8 and R19 are each independently selected from the group of monovalent hydrocarbon radicals having from 1 to 60 carbon atoms, where the subscripts a, b, c and d are zero or positive; is reacted under hydrosilylation conditions<br><br>
with a sub-stoichiometric quantity, i.e. a molar quantity that is less than the molar quantity equivalent to the sums of the subscripts b and d; that quantity being the sum of stoichiometric subscripts h and i, of an olefinic polyether having the formula:<br>
CH2= CH(R9)(Rl0)nO(Rl lMCaH4O)p(C3H6O)(|(C4H8O)R12<br>
where<br>
R9 is H or a 1 to 6 carbon atom alkyl group; R10 is a divalent alkyl radical of 1 to 6 carbons where the subscript n may be 0 or 1; R11 is selected from the group of divalent radicals consisting of -C2H4O-, -C3H6O-, and -C4H8O- where the subscript o may be 0 or 1; R12 is H, a monofunctional hydrocarbon radical of 1 to 6 carbons, or acetyl and the subscripts p, q and r are zero or positive. When the polyether is composed of mixed oxyalkyleneoxide groups (i.e. oxyethylene, oxypropylene and oxybutylene) the units may be blocked, or randomly distributed. The resulting terpolymer has a formula consistent with the formula:<br>
MaMHb.hMPEcDcDHd.iDPEf<br>
where the superscript PE indicates polyether substitution, with<br>
MPE = R4R5(-CH2CH(R9)(R10)nO(R11)o(CH4O)p(C3H6O)q(C4H8O)rR12 )SiO1/2and<br>
DPÂ£ = R8(-CH2CH(R9)(R10)nO(R,,)o(C2H4O)p(C3H6O)q(C4H8O)rR12 )SiO2/2 This terpolymer is further reacted under hydrosilylation conditions with a sub-stoichiometric quantity, i.e. a molar quantity that is less than the molar quantity equivalent to the sums of the subscripts (b-h) and (d-i); that quantity being the sum of stoichiometric subscripts k and 1, of an olefinic epoxide or oxirane having the formula:<br><br><br>
which is R17R18C=CR16QsQtR15(COC)R13R14, where R13, R14, R,s, R16, R17 and R18 are each independently selected from the group of hydrogen and monovalent hydrocarbon radicals having from one to sixty carbon atoms, Qt is a di- or trivalent hydrocarbon radical having from one to sixty carbon atoms, Q1, is a divalent hydrocarbon radical having from one to sixty carbon atoms with the subscripts s and t independently zero or one subject to the limitation that when Qt is trivalent R14 is absent and Qs forms a bond with the carbon bearing R13 where R16 and R18 may be either cis- or trans- to each other. The resulting polymer has a formula consistent with:<br>
MaMHWl-kMPEeMEgDcDHd,,DPE^Ej,<br>
where the superscript E indicates epoxide or oxirane substitution, with<br>
ME = R4R5(-Rl7R,8C-CRl6QsQ,Rl5(COC)Rl3R14 )SiOi/2and<br>
DE = R8(-R17Rl8C-CRl6QsQtRl5(COC)Rl3R14 )SiO2/2.<br>
[0011] When the residual hydride is greater than zero, as indicated by non-zero values for stoichiometric quantities of (b-h-k) and (d-i-1), further hydrosilylation reactions with various olefmic species including alkenyl silicone resins may be conducted to create higher order polymers. It should be noted that the sequence of hydrosilylation reactions described may be reversed or they may be combined and accomplished in one reaction.<br>
[0012] The polymer having the formula;<br><br>
MaMHb.h.kMPEeMEgDcDHd.|.1Dpe(DEj<br>
is further reacted with acrylic acid, a substituted acrylic acid or esters thereof to provide an acrylate ester of the epoxide or oxirane functional group, providing the acrylate ester polymer having a formula:<br>
MaMVh-kMPEeMAeDcDHd,.,Dpe(DAj)<br>
where the superscript a is indicative of and denotes a substituent that is the reaction product between the epoxy substituent: (-R17Rl8C-CRl6QsQtRl5(COC)R13R14 ) and an acrylate species. Addition of excess acrylate species along with a free radical initiator generates polyacrylate cross links.  The acrylated polyether-grafted polysiloxane copolymer may be polymerized or copolymerized with one or more comonomers, under free radical polymerization conditions, which polymerization may be conducted in various solvents, using catalysts and temperatures as are known in the art for polymerizing acrylates.   Suitable solvents include but are not limited to silicone fluid, water, alcohol, ester, hydrocarbon fluid or organic oil. Examples of free radical initiating catalysts (hereinafter free radical initiator) include: inorganic peroxides such as hydrogen peroxide, ammonium persulfate, potassium persulfate and the like; organic peroxy catalysts, such as dialkyl peroxides, e.g., diisopropyl peroxide, dilauryl peroxide, di-t-butyl peroxide, dicumyl peroxide, alkyl hydrogen peroxides such as t-butyl hydrogen peroxide, t-amyl hydrogen peroxide, cumyl hydrogen peroxide, diacyl peroxide, for instance acetyl peroxide, lauroyl peroxide, benzoyl peroxide, peroxy ester such as ethyl peroxybenzoate, pavalate peroxide, the azo compounds such as 2-azobis(isobutyronitrile), l-azobis(l-cyclohexanecarbonitrile) and the like and other free radical generating catalysts.<br>
[0013] Thus in one embodiment the compositions of the present invention are the reaction product between polymers having the formula:<br>
MaMHb.h.kMPEcMAgDcDHd,,DPEfDAj<br><br>
and acrylate species.<br>
[0014] More generally any hydride bearing silicone polymer maybe subjected to this reaction scheme to produce epoxy substituted, polyether substituted silicone polymers that may then be reacted with acrylic acid, substituted acrylic acid or its derivatives to produce acrylate cross-linked polyether substituted silicone polymer networks. The epoxy substituted polyether-grafted polysiloxane copolymer having the formula:<br>
MaMHb.h.KMPECMEgDcDHd,,DPEjDEj<br>
is reacted with an acrylate, usually acrylic acid or methacrylic acid to form an acrylated polyether-grafted polysiloxane copolymer. The epoxy ring opening reaction with acrylate will proceed uncatalyzed but a catalyst may be employed. Examples of useful catalysts include l,4-Diazabicyclo(2.2.2)octane, aluminum chloride, titanium tetra(isopropoxide), p-toluene sulfonic acid, methane sulfonic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, morpholine tributylamine, benzoyldimethy amine, tetraalkylurea compounds such as 1,1 ',3,3 '-tetrametbylurea.<br>
[0015] More generally the process of the present invention leading to compositions of the present invention comprises reacting a silicone hydride having the formula:<br>
MaMHbDcDHdTeTH(Qg<br>
under hydrosilylation conditions with a sub-stoichiometric quantity of an olefmic polyether, that sub-stoichiometric molar quantity represented by the sum (h+i+j) to yield a polyether substituted polymer having a formula consistent with:<br>
MaMHb-hMPEhDcDHdiDPETHf-jTPEQg-<br>
[0016] The polyether substituted polymer having the formula:<br><br>
is subsequently reacted under hydrosilylation conditions with a sub-stoichiometric quantity of an olefinic epoxide or oxirane, that sub-stoichiometric molar quantity represented by the sum (k+l+m), to yield an epoxy and polyether substituted polymer having a formula consistent with:<br>
MaMHb-h.kMPEhMEkDcDHd.i.,DPEiDE,TeTHf.j.mTPEjTEmQg.<br>
[0017] Reaction of<br>
MaMVh-kMp\MEkDcDHd.MDPEiDEtTeTHf.j.mTPEjTEmQe.<br>
with acryiate functional compounds creates the correspond acryiate esters of the epoxy or oxirane groups leading to a silicone polymer having the following formula:<br>
MaMHb4,-kMPEhMAkDcDHd.i.lDPEiDAITcTHf.j.mTPEjTAmQE)<br>
where the superscript A is indicative of and denotes a substituent that is the reaction product between the epoxy substituent: (-Rl7Rl8C-CR16QsQtRi5(COC)Rl3R14 ) and an acryiate species. The epoxy substituted polyether-grafted polysiloxane copolymer having the formula:<br>
MaMHb.h.kMPEllMEkDcDHd,,DPEiDE1TcTHf.j.mTPEjTEmQ8<br>
is reacted with an acryiate, usually acrylic acid or methacrylic acid to form an acrylated polyether-grafted polysiloxane copolymer. The epoxy ring opening reaction with acryiate will proceed uncatalyzed but a catalyst may be employed. Examples of useful catalysts include 1,4-Diazabicycio(2.2.2)octane, aluminum chloride, titanium tetra(isopropoxide), p-toluene sulfonic acid, methane sulfonic acid, trichloroacetic acid, morpholine tributylamine, benzoyldimethy amine, tetraalkylurea compounds such as l,r,3,3'-tetramethylurea.<br>
[0018] The polymer<br><br>
MaMH^.kMPEhMAkDcDHd,,DPBiDAITcTHf,,mTPEj'rAmQg<br>
may then be further reacted with an additional quantity of an acrylate species or mixture thereof under conditions suitable to polymerize the acrylate components thereby generating acrylate oligomeric or polymeric cross links between the precursor MaMHb-h-kMPEhMA1cDcDHd-i-iI&gt;PEiDAiTeTHf.j.mTPEjTAmQ6 polymer. These two steps may combined by utilizing either a stoichiometric or super stoichiometric amount of acrylate.<br>
[0019] The compositions of the present invention include:<br>
and the reaction product of these compounds with acrylate components.<br>
[0020] As used herein the word "acrylate" is a collective noun for the following chemical species: acrylic acid and methacrylic acid or ester derivatives thereof such as methyl, ethyl, butyl, amyl, 2-ethylhexyl, cyclohexyl, vinyl, ally], hydroxyethyl, perfluoroethyl, isobomyl, phenoxyethyl, tetraethylene glycol, tripropylene glycol, trimethylolpropane, polyoxyalkylene, organic modified polysiloxane (for example, the acrylated hydrophilic polysiloxane used as the emulsion precursor in US Patent 6,207, 782), anionic acrylates/methacrylates, such as sulfate, sulfonate or phosphate functionalized acrylate or mixtures thereof and any catalyst necessary for reaction with the epoxy or oxirane group.   A single acrylate or various combinations of acrylates and methacrylates may be employed.<br>
[0021] As used herein, integer values of stoichiometric subscripts refer to molecular species arid non-integer values of stoichiometric subscripts refer to a mixture of molecular species on a molecular weight average basis, a number average basis or a mole fraction basis. In the case of mixtures of the compounds of the present invention, it should be readily apparent that the stoichiometric subscripts of mixtures will have<br><br><br>
average values for the subscripts that may be either integral or non-integral in contrast to those of pure compounds.<br>
[0022] The present invention provides for a method of making a silicone composition, the silicone composition and uses thereof comprising the reaction product of:<br>

[0041] Depending on the relative amounts of D, DA and DpÂ£ groups in the final cross-linked copolymeric network composition, the cross-linked composition will be swellable by either 1) a hydroxylic solvent such as water, an alcohol, or a carboxylic acid or solvent mixture where an aqueous or non-aqueous hydroxylic solvent is a component or 2) a non-aqueous non-hydrophilic solvent that may either be a silicone or an organic solvent as hereinafter later defined, or mixtures containing such solvents. For purposes of this discussion only these two classes of cross-linked swellable network copolymers will be referred to as "water-swellable" or "oil-swellable" (the term oil swellable encompassing ail swelling solvents not embraced by the term "water swellable"). Generally, water swellability is more likely to occur with cross-linked network copolymers where the following relationships obtain:<br>
1)	for the number of D groups present: about 5 
2)	for the number of DPE groups present: DPE &gt; about 5; and<br>
3)	the acrylate cross-links constituting at least about 5 weight percent or more of the non-swollen cross-linked polymer network.<br>
[0042] In contrast, oil swellability is more likely to occur with cross-linked network copolymers where the following relationships obtain:<br>
1)	for the number of D groups present: about 90 
2)	for the number of DPE groups present: about 1 
3)	the acrylate cross-links constituting no more than about 10 weight percent or less of the non-swollen cross-linked polymer network.<br><br>
[0043] It is to be emphasized that the preceding ranges of structural parameters and stoichiometric subscripts exemplified for water or oil swellability are variable and interdependent and each parametric variable may be exceeded by being greater than or less than the indicated ranges and still observing a particular type of swellability by reason of a homeostatic variation in another structural or stoichiometric parameter associated with the particular polymer.<br>
[0044] Since both the acrylate cross-links and the polyether substituents are capable of hydrogen bonding with water and other hydroxylic solvents, increasing content of either, all other composition variables remaining constant, will tend to increase the water swellability of the resulting cross-linked network polymer. Because it is possible to vary the compositional parameters of the cross-linked network copolymers of the invention in an almost limitless fashion, some compositions are both water swellable and oil swellable while others are only water swellable or oil swellable, and some compositions will not be swellable with any of the solvents discussed herein. The amount of crosslinking present in the crosslinked network may be characterized with respect to the degree of swelling exhibited by the network in the fluid. In another embodiment, the crosslinked structure of the network is effective to allow the network to be swollen from its original volume to a swollen volume that is a factor of from 1.01 to 5000, more preferably from 2 to 1000, and even more preferably from 5 to 500, times its original volume. The original volume of the network can be determined, for example, by extracting or evaporating all of the fluid component from the silicone composition of the present invention to leave the original volume, that is, the volume of the polyether siloxane copolymer network in the absence of the fluid.<br>
[0045] The compositions of the present invention are self-emulsifying.<br>
[0046] The silicone composition may be further processed under low to high shear to adjust the viscosity and sensory feel of the composition. This may be achieved, for example, by subjecting the composition to a moderate to high shearing force. High shear may be applied using, for example, a Sonolator apparatus, a Gaulin Homogenizer<br><br>
or a Micro Fluidizer apparatus. Optionally, one or more fluids may be added to the silicone composition prior to the shearing.<br>
[0047] In a preferred embodiment, the silicone composition of the present invention is a solid, typically having a creamy consistency, wherein the copolymer network acts as a means for gelling the fluid to reversibly impart characteristics of a solid to the fluid. At rest, the silicone composition exhibits the properties of a solid gel material. The silicone composition of the present invention exhibits high stability and resistance to syneresis, that is, the composition exhibits little or no tendency for fluid to flow from the composition and imparts high stability and syneresis resistance to personal care compositions which include the silicone composition as a component. The high stability and syneresis resistance persists with prolonged aging of such silicone compositions and personal care compositions. However, fluid may be released from the network by subjecting the silicone composition to a shearing force, such as, for example, by rubbing the composition between one's fingers, to provide improved sensory feel characteristic of the fluid component of the silicone material.<br>
[0048] Water (or a water equivalent such as a non-aqueous hydroxylic solvent), siloxane, linear or cyclic, or lipophilic fluid (oil swelling agent, oil swellable) maybe used as the swelling agent. Lipophilic fluids suitable for use as the fluid component of the composition of the present invention are those compounds or mixtures of two or more compounds that are in the liquid state at or near room temperature, for example, from about 20Â°C about 50Â°C, and about one atmosphere pressure, and include, for example, silicone fluids, hydrocarbon fluids, esters, alcohols, fatty alcohols, glycols and organic oils. In a preferred embodiment, the fluid component of the composition of the present invention exhibits a viscosity of below about 1,000 cSt, preferably below about 500 cSt, more preferably below about 250 cSt, and most preferably below 100 cSt, at 25 Â°C.<br>
[0049] In one preferred embodiment, the polyacrylate siloxane copolymer network is a crosslinked network that is insoluble in various fluid components, but that is capable of being swollen by the fluid. The amount of crosslinking present in the<br><br>
crosslinked network may be characterized with respect to the degree of swelling exhibited by the network in the fluid. In another preferred embodiment, the crosslinked structure of the network is effective to allow the network to be swollen by water, from its original volume to a swollen volume that is a factor of from 1.01 to 5000, more preferably from 2 to 1000, and even more preferably from 5 to 500, times its original volume. The original volume of the network can be determined, for example, by extracting or evaporating all of the fluid components from the silicone composition of the present invention to leave the original volume, that is, the volume of the polyacrylate siloxane copolymer network in the absence of the fluid. In another preferred embodiment, the crosslinked structure of the network is effective to allow the network to be swollen by a lipophilic fluid, from its original volume to a swollen volume that is a factor of from 1.01 to 5000, more preferably from 2 to 1000, and even more preferably from 5 to 500, times its original volume. The original volume of the network can be determined, for example, by extracting or evaporating all of the fluid components from the silicone composition of the present invention to leave the original volume, that is, the volume of the polyacrylate siloxane copolymer network in the absence of the fluid. In another preferred embodiment, the crosslinked structure of the network is effective to allow the network to be swollen by a low molecular weight silicone fluid, such as, for example, decamethylcyclopentasiloxane, from its original volume to a swollen volume that is a factor of from 1.01 to 5000, more preferably from 2 to 1000, and even more preferably from 5 to 500, times its original volume. The original volume of the network can be determined, for example, by extracting or evaporating all of the fluid component from the silicone composition of the present invention to leave the original volume, that is, the volume of the polyacrylate siloxane copolymer network in the absence of the fluid.<br>

The non-aqueous organic hydroxylic solvents are selected from the group consisting of hydroxyl containing organic compounds comprising alcohols, glycols, polyhydric alcohols and polymeric glycols and mixtures thereof that are liquid at room temperature, e.g. about 25 Â°C, and about one atmosphere pressure.

[0098] The rinse-resistant water-in-oil sunscreen lotion composition of Example 19 showed excellent stability under the heating (to 50Â°C) and freeze-thaw' conditions. It exhibited a highly desirable sensory feel, a cooling effect on the skin. In-vitro SPF measurement on vitro skin determined before and after immersed in stirred water for 40 minutes were 25 and 25 respectively (average of 3 measurements), polyacrylate siloxane copolymer network composition IV provided about 100% SPF retention following a rinse treatment with water. Furthermore, when the composition was applied to the skin, not only was the film formed on the skin surface repellent to water and resistant to rinsing by water, water was actually capable of being absorbed by the film, or emulsified into the film, thus preserving the integrity of the film on the skin. This is expected to confer some or all of the benefits of water-proofing, rinse-resistance, and tolerance to sweat.<br>

Approximately 6 mg of 2,2,6,6-Tetramethylpiperidine 1-oxyl and 1.05 g of tetraisopropyl titanate were added. The mixture was heated to 90Â°C for approximately 3 hours. Then 150.00 g of the resulting materials was mixed with 350.00 g of cyclopentasiloxane. Nitrogen was bubbled through for 30 minutes. The mixture was stirred and heated to 100Â°C. Then 0.3 lg of dilauroyl peroxide was added. The mixture was stirred for approximately 2 hours at 100Â° to give a translucent soft solid.<br>

Example 35    Use of Silicone Gel XII in a rinse-off hair conditioner<br>
[0125] A rinse-off hair conditioner formulation was made by combining the ingredients listed in table XXV, according to the following procedure: (1) Part B was made by combining the ingredients and mixing until uniform; (2) Part C was then mixed with the ingredients in Part C at 70Â°C until uniform; (3) The mixture of Part B and Part C was then added to Part A; (4) The mixture was mixed at 70Â°C until uniform and then cooled to 35Â°C while being mixed. This rinse-off conditioner formulation was tested on platinum blond hair tresses. Duplicate platinum blond hair tresses were washed under standard laboratory procedures with a model shampoo formulation, followed by treatment with the rinse-off hair conditioner formulation of Sample 35. These tresses were then washed and dried using a blow drier. Dry detangling was measured and is defined as the number of inches a comb travels when the tress is placed on a calibrated chart and is combed from top to bottom. Static control was evaluated by measuring fly-<br><br>
away. Hair was combed quickly for ten times and fly-away is defined as the difference between the total width of the entire tress and the width of the hair bundle after the hair has been combed. Lower fly-away indicates better static control.<br>

Example 37    Use of Silicone Gel XII in a hair styling composition<br>
[0129] A hair styling formulation was made by mixing the ingredients listed in table XXIX. This hair styling formulation was tested on light brown hair tresses. Duplicate hair tresses were wetted followed by treatment with the bair styling formulation of Example 37. These treated hair tresses were rolled around hair rollers, dried in an oven at temperature of 100 Â°c for one hour and then conditioned at ambient temperature overnight. These hair tresses were then carefully removed from the roller and hung on a ruler rack. The lengths of these hair tresses were measured and recorded as the initial lengths. The tresses on the ruler rack were then put in a 25Â°C and 90% Relative Humidity chamber. Length measurements were taken every 15 minutes for 2 hours. Curl retention for each treated hair tress was calculated using the following formula.<br><br><br>
Curl Retention0/Â© = <br>

[0130] The measurement results shown in Table XXX showed that Gel XII enhanced hair curl retention significantly compared with Comparative Example 12. The combination of Gel XII and SF1708, an amino-functional silicone, provided even higher hair retention than Gel XII itself. This is a surprising result since the SF1708 at a level of 1% in cyclopentasiloxane provides no additional curl retention benefit compared to cyclopentsiloxane alone. Thus, Gel composition XII combined with an aminosilicone fluid provides a clear and unexpected synergistic curl retention benefit.<br>
[0131] Panel tests showed that the composition of Sample 37-1 or 37-2, when applied to hair, provided a smoother feel, less frizz and better hair alignment compared with Comparative Example 12.<br><br>
Example 38    Use of Silicone Gel XII as an w/o emulsifier<br>
[0132] Silicone Gel XII, prepared according to Example 26 was combined with the other ingredients listed in Table XXXI, according to the following procedure: (1) Part A was made by mixing the ingredients until uniform; (2) Part B was made in a separate container by mixing the ingredients until uniform. (3) Part B was added slowing to Part A and the mixture was mixed until uniform. The viscosities of these emulsions were measured 24 hours after the emulsions were made. The stabilities of these emulsions were visually evaluated for obvious phase separation in heating and freeze-thaw tests. In a heating test, the emulsion samples were kept at 50Â°C in an oven for 5 days. Three freeze-thaw cycles were done in each freeze thaw test. The compositions and the results of testing completed on these emulsions are summarized in Table XXXI.<br>

[0133] The water in oil emulsion compositions of Sample 38-1 and 3S-2 showed excellent free-thaw and heat stabilities. The viscosity measurement results also showed that the combination of Silicone Gel XII and Magnasoft Plus, an amino-functional silicone, provided better thickening in water in oil emulsion than Silicone Gel XII itself.<br>
Example 39    Preparation of Silicone Gel XIII<br>
[0134] 100 g of polyacrylate siloxane copolymer network composition XI prepared according to Example 25 was combined with 98 g of cylcopentasiloxane and 2 g of SF1708 amino-functional silicone fluid and mixed using an overhead mixer at 600 RPM for 30 minutes to produce Silicone Gel XIII.<br>
[0135] Samples of Silicone Gel XII and Silicone Gel XIH were placed on an aluminum surface and the cyclopentasiloxane allowed to evaporate at ambient temperature and humidity. This produced a film. The film that was formed was evaluated after 48h for tackiness on a scale of 0-10 (where 0 is no tack, and 10 is "Very tacky"). The results of the tack evaluation are given in Table XXXII.<br>
Table XXXII.<br>
Tack evaluation for films produced from Gel compositions.<br><br>
	Gel XII	Gel XIII<br>
Tack Feeling	8	2<br>
[0100] The results of the tack evaluation clearly show that the film produced from Gel XIII has very little tack, and is much less tacky than the film produced from Gel XII.<br>
[0101] This is a surprising result since the amino-functional silicone fluid, SF1708, when spread as a thin film, has a high level of tack. Thus, it is surprising that the incorporation of a fluid with a high level of tack into the Gel composition XIII, would have the effect of producing a film that has a very low level of tack.<br><br>
Example 40    Preparation of Functionalized Silicone Network Composition XIII in silicone fluid<br>
[0102] 1000 g of a silicone hydride fluid with the approximate composition MD125DH7.7M was mixed with 34.18 g of 4-vinylcyciohexene-l,2-epoxide and 470.36 g of aliyl terminated polyether with the formula of CH2=CH-CH2-O-(EO)5(PO)5-CH3.The mixture was heated to 85Â°C and 0.40 g of platinum catalyst solution (10 mg /ml chloroplatinic acid in Ethanol) was added. The reaction was buffered with sodium propionate. The mixture was stirred at 85Â°C for 2 hours to form an epoxy functional polyether-polysiloxane copolymer. The copolymer was then neutralized with sodium bicarbonate, vacuum stripped and filtrated. Then 150.00 g of the resulting epoxy functional polyether-polysiloxane copolymer and 1.40 g of acrylic acid were mixed. Approximately 3 mg of 2,2,6,6-Tetramethylpiperidine 1-oxyl and 0.45 g of tetraisopropyl titanate were added. The mixture was heated to 90Â°C for approximately 3 hours. Then 150.00 g of the resulting materials was mixed with 350.00 g of cyclopentasiloxane. Nitrogen was bubbled through for 30 minutes. The mixture was stirred and heated to 100Â°C. Then 0.31g of dilauroyl peroxide was added. The mixture was stirred for approximately 2 hours at 100Â° to give a translucent soft solid.<br>
Example 41    Preparation of Silicone Gel XIV<br>
[0103] 30 g of Functionalized Silicone Network Composition XEI prepared according to Example 40 was mixed with 50 g of cylcopentasiloxane and mixed using an overhead mixer at 600 RPM for 30 minutes. The resulting Silicone Gel XIV had a viscosity of 76,000 centiPoise (;cPs") (measured after 24 hours).<br><br>
