Technical Field<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a silver-supporting zirconium phosphate;<br>
this is a novel silver-based inorganic antimicrobial agent that has excellent heat<br>
resistance, chemical resistance, and processability and that gives little<br>
discoloration when mixed with a plastic. Furthermore, the present invention<br>
relates to an antimicrobial product comprising the silver-based inorganic<br>
antimicrobial agent.<br>
Background Art<br>
[0002]<br>
In recent years, zirconium phosphate-based inorganic ion exchangers<br>
have been utilized in various applications by making use of their characteristics.<br>
With regard to the zirconium phosphate-based inorganic ion exchangers, there<br>
are amorphous ones, crystalline ones having a 2-dimensional layer structure, and<br>
crystalline ones having a 3-dimensional network structure. Among them,<br>
hexagonal zirconium phosphate, which has a 3-dimensional network structure, is<br>
excellent in terms of heat resistance, chemical resistance, radiation resistance,<br>
low thermal expansion properties, etc., and is applied to the immobilization of<br>
radioactive waste, solid electrolytes, gas adsorbing/separating agents, catalysts,<br>
antimicrobial agent starting materials, etc.<br>
[0003]<br>
Various hexagonal zirconium phosphates are known to date. Examples<br>
thereof include AxNH4(1-x)Zr2(PO4)3nH2O (ref. e.g. Patent Publication 1),<br>
AZr2(PO4)3nH2O (ref. e.g. Patent Publication 2), and HnR1-nZr2(PO4)3mH2O (ref.<br>
e.g. Patent Publication 3).<br>
Zirconium phosphates in which the ratio of Zr to P varies are also known.<br>
Examples thereof include Na1+4xZr2-x(PO4)3 (ref. e.g. Nonpatent Publication 1),<br>
Na1+2xMgxZr2-x(PO4)3 (ref. e.g. Nonpatent Publications 1 and 2), and<br><br>
Na1+xZr2SixP3-xO12 (ref. e.g. Nonpatent Publications 2 and 3).<br>
[0004]<br>
With regard to a process for synthesizing these hexagonal zirconium<br>
phosphates, a calcination method in which synthesis is carried out by mixing<br>
starting materials and then calcining the mixture at 1,000°C or higher using a<br>
calcining furnace, etc., a hydrothermal method in which synthesis is carried out by<br>
mixing starting materials in water or in a state in which they contain water and then<br>
heating under pressure, a wet method in which synthesis is carried out by mixing<br>
starting materials in water and then heating at normal pressure, etc. are known.<br>
[0005]<br>
Among these methods, the calcination method enables zirconium<br>
phosphate having an appropriately adjusted P/Zr ratio to be synthesized just by<br>
mixing starting materials and heating them at high temperature. However, in the<br>
calcination method it is not easy to mix the starting materials uniformly, and it is<br>
difficult to get a zirconium phosphate having a homogeneous composition.<br>
Furthermore, since it is necessary to carry out grinding and classification after<br>
calcination in order to obtain particles, there are problems with quality and<br>
productivity. Moreover, it is obviously impossible to synthesize a crystalline<br>
zirconium phosphate containing ammonia by the calcination method. On the<br>
other hand, the wet method and the hydrothermal method can give homogeneous<br>
fine particulate zirconium phosphate, but apart from one having a P/Zr ratio of 1.5,<br>
and one having a P/Zr ratio of 2 represented by Formula [3] below, no crystalline<br>
zirconium phosphate is known.<br>
NH4ZrH(PO4)2	[3]<br>
[0006]<br>
Silver, copper, zinc, tin, mercury, lead, iron, cobalt, nickel, manganese,<br>
arsenic, antimony, bismuth, bariµm, cadmiµm, chromiµm, etc. ions have for a long<br>
time been known as metal ions that exhibit antimold properties, antimicrobial<br>
properties, and antialgal properties (hereinafter, abbreviated to antimicrobial<br>
metal ions). In particular silver ion is widely used as a silver nitrate aqueous<br>
solution having a disinfecting action and a sterilizing action. However, many of<br><br>
the above-mentioned metal ions that exhibit antimold properties, antimicrobial<br>
properties, or antialgal properties are harmful to the human body; there are<br>
various restrictions on the application method, storage method, disposal method,<br>
etc., and, their applications are also limited.<br>
[0007]<br>
In order to exhibit antimold properties, antimicrobial properties, and<br>
antialgal properties, it is sufficient to apply a trace amount of antimicrobial metal<br>
to an application target. Because of this, there have been proposed as<br>
antimicrobial agents having antimold properties, antimicrobial properties, and<br>
antialgal properties an organic supported antimicrobial agent having an<br>
antimicrobial metal ion supported on an ion-exchange resin, a chelate resin, etc.<br>
and an inorganic antimicrobial agent having an antimicrobial metal ion supported<br>
on a clay mineral, an inorganic ion-exchanger, or a porous body.<br>
[0008]<br>
With regard to the above-mentioned various types of antimicrobial agents,<br>
compared with the organic supported type inorganic antimicrobial agents have the<br>
advantages of higher safety, a longer lasting antimicrobial effect and, moreover,<br>
excellent heat resistance.<br>
As one of the inorganic antimicrobial agents, an antimicrobial agent in<br>
which alkali metal ions such as sodium ions in a clay mineral such as<br>
montmorillonite or zeolite are ion-exchanged with silver ions is known. Since the<br>
skeleton structure of the clay mineral itself has poor acid resistance, silver ions<br>
are easily leached in, for example, an acidic solution, and the antimicrobial effect<br>
does not last long.<br>
Furthermore, since silver ions are unstable toward exposure to heat and<br>
light and are easily reduced to metallic silver, there are problems with long-term<br>
stability, such as coloration being caused.<br>
[0009]<br>
In order to increase the silver ion stability, there is one in which silver ions<br>
and ammonium ions are supported on a zeolite by ion-exchanging so that they<br>
coexist. However, the prevention of coloration does not reach a practical level<br><br>
even in this system, and a fundamental solution to the problem has yet to be<br>
found.<br>
Furthermore, as another inorganic antimicrobial agent, there is an<br>
antimicrobial agent having an antimicrobial metal supported on an adsorptive<br>
active carbon. However, in this agent since a soluble antimicrobial metal salt is<br>
only physically adsorbed or attached, when contacted with moisture the<br>
antimicrobial metal ion is rapidly leached, and the antimicrobial effect does not<br>
last long.<br>
[0010]<br>
Recently, an antimicrobial agent having antimicrobial metal ions supported<br>
on a special zirconium phosphate salt has been proposed. For example, one<br>
represented by Formula [4] below is known (ref. e.g. Patent Publication 4).<br>
M1M2xHyAz(PO4) 2nH2O [4]<br>
(In Formula [4], M1 is one type selected from 4-valent metals, M2 is one type<br>
selected from silver, copper, zinc, tin, mercury, lead, iron, cobalt, nickel,<br>
manganese, arsenic, antimony, bismuth, bariµm, cadmiµm, and chromiµm, A is<br>
one type selected from alkali metal ions and alkaline earth metal ions, n is a value<br>
satisfying O 
<y and x y z="2," provided that i is the valence of m2.></y>
This antimicrobial agent is known as a material that is chemically and<br>
physically stable and exhibits antimold and antimicrobial properties for a long<br>
period of time. However, when it is kneaded with a synthetic resin such as nylon,<br>
the entire resin might be colored, the processability is poor due to the particle size,<br>
and it cannot be used as a product.<br>

[2] cannot be synthesized in some cases. It is not preferable for the pH to be less<br>
than 1 since a zirconium phosphate represented by Formula [2] cannot be<br>
synthesized in some cases For adjustment of the pH, it is preferable to use<br>

phosphate represented by Formula [2] so that the starting materials are<br>
homogenously mixed and the reaction proceeds uniformly.<br>

of a zirconium phosphate represented by Formula [2] is preferably 0.1 to 5 µrn,<br>
more preferably 0.2 to 3 µm, and yet more preferably 0.3 to 2 µm. When the<br>
processability into various types of products is taken into consideration, not only<br>
the median diameter but also the maximum particle diameter and the spread are<br>
important. From this point, the maximum particle diameter of a zirconium<br>
phosphate represented by Formula [2] is preferably no greater than 10 µm, and<br><br>
more preferably no greater than 8 µm, and it is particularly preferable for it to be<br>
no greater than 6 urn since an effect can be exhibited. The standard deviation for<br>
the median diameter is preferably no greater than 1, and it is more preferable for it<br>
to, be no, greater than 0.5 since an effect can be exhibited more effectively.<br>
Furthermore, a silver-based inorganic antimicrobial agent represented by<br>
Formula [1], which is obtained by subjecting a zirconium phosphate represented<br>
by Formula [2] to silver ion exchange, preferably has the same median diameter,<br>
maximum particle diameter, and standard deviation as those of the zirconium<br>
phosphate of Formula [2] above. Since there is hardly any change in the median<br>
diameter, the maximum particle diameter, and the standard deviation as a result of<br>
silver ion exchange, by setting the median diameter, the maximum particle<br>
diameter, and the standard deviation of the zirconium phosphate represented by<br>
Formula [2] so as to be in the above-mentioned ranges it is possible to set the<br>
median diameter, the maximum particle diameter, and the standard deviation of<br>
the silver-based inorganic antimicrobial agent represented by Formula [1] in<br>
desired ranges.<br>
[0038]<br>
As examples of zirconium phosphates represented by Formula [2], which<br>
can be used as starting materials for the silver-based inorganic antimicrobial<br>
agent of the present invention, those listed below can be cited. However, since<br>
those having ammonium ion have low ion-exchangeability, when a high silver ion<br>
exchange rate is required, the ammonium ion may be eliminated by carrying out<br>
calcination, etc. as necessary, thus giving an H type, which has high<br>
ion-exchangeability.<br>

In order to obtain the silver-based inorganic antimicrobial agent of the<br>
present invention, it is necessary to subject a zirconium phosphate represented by<br>
Formula [2] to silver ion exchange. A method for carrying out this silver ion<br>
exchange may involve immersing a zirconium phosphate represented by Formula<br>
[2] in an aqueous solution containing an appropriate concentration of silver ion.<br>
It is preferable to carry out stirring, etc. during this immersion, thus making a<br>
uniformly mixed state. The amount immersed may be a concentration that can<br>
be mixed with the aqueous solution uniformly, and the zirconium phosphate<br>
represented by Formula [2] is preferably no greater than 20 wt %. For the<br>
preparation of an aqueous solution containing silver ions, it is preferable to use an<br>
aqueous solution in which silver nitrate is dissolved in ion-exchanged water. The<br>
temperature of the aqueous solution at the time of ion exchange may be 0°C to<br>
100°C and is preferably 20°C to 80°C. Since this ion exchange takes place<br>
quickly, the immersion time may be less than 5 min, but in order to obtain a<br>
uniform and high silver ion exchange rate, it is preferably 3O min to 5 hours.<br>
Even if this is carried out for 5 hours or more, there are cases in which silver ion<br>
exchange does not progress further.<br><br>
After completion of the silver ion exchange, this is washed well with<br>
ion-exchanged water etc. and dried, thus giving the silver-based inorganic<br>
antimicrobial agent of the, present invention.<br>
[0040] ,<br>
In order to improve the discoloration resistance of the silver-based<br>
inorganic antimicrobial agent of the present invention, it is preferable to calcine<br>
the silver-based inorganic antimicrobial agent obtained above. This calcination<br>
for improving the discoloration resistance may be carried out prior to silver ion<br>
exchange, but in order to obtain sufficient discoloration resistance, it is particularly<br>
preferable to carry it out subsequent to silver ion exchange. The calcination<br>
temperature is preferably 550°C to 1,000°C, more preferably 600°C to 900°C, and<br>
yet more preferably 650°C to 800°C in order to improve the discoloration<br>
resistance. The calcination time is preferably at least 1 hour, more preferably at<br>
least 2 hours, and yet more preferably at least 4 hours in order to improve the<br>
discoloration resistance. This calcination time is preferably no longer than 48<br>
hours, and more preferably no longer than 36 hours.<br>
After completion of the calcination, if left as it is for a long period of time,<br>
there is a possibility of moisture absorption, and it is therefore preferable to cool<br>
within 24 hours, and more preferably within 18 hours. Since the silver-based<br>
inorganic antimicrobial agent of the present invention sometimes aggregates after<br>
calcination, the aggregated material may be ground using a grinder. In this case,<br>
taking into consideration moisture absorption, etc., the grinding time is better to be<br>
short.<br>

invention when used is not particularly limited, and it may be mixed with another<br>
component as appropriate according to the intended purpose or made into a<br>
composite with another material. For example, the silver-based inorganic<br>

material may be used in combination as necessary.<br>

[0044]<br>
An antimicrobial resin composition can easily be obtained by adding the<br>
silver-based inorganic antimicrobial agent of the present invention to a resin.<br>
The type of resin that can be used is not particularly limited; the resin may be any<br>
of a natural resin, a synthetic resin, and a semi-synthetic resin, and the resin may<br>
be either a thermoplastic resin or a thermosetting resin. The resin may be any<br>
one of a resin for molding, a resin for fiber, and a rubber resin, and specific<br><br>

agent of the present invention may be formed into a composite with a fiber such as<br>
a natural fiber, thus giving an antimicrobial fiber.<br>
[0045]<br>
The proportion of the silver-based inorganic antimicrobial agent of the<br>
present invention in the antimicrobial resin composition is preferably 0.03 to 5<br>
parts by weight relative to 10O parts by weight of the antimicrobial resin<br>
composition, and more preferably 0.1 to 2.O parts by weight. If it is less than 0.03<br>
parts by weight, the antimicrobial properties of the antimicrobial resin composition<br>
might be insufficient, and on the other hand if it is present at more than 5 parts by<br>
weight, there is hardly any further improvement of the antimicrobial effect, it is not<br>
cost-effective, and the physical properties of the resin might be greatly degraded.<br>
[0046]<br>
A method for adding the silver-based inorganic antimicrobial agent of the<br>
present invention to a resin and processing into a resin molding may be any<br>
known method. For example, there are (1) a method in which an attachment<br>
agent for enhancing the adhesion between a silver-based inorganic antimicrobial<br>
agent powder and a resin or a dispersant for improving the dispersibility of the<br>
antimicrobial agent powder is used, and mixing with the resin in the form of pellets<br>
or a powder is carried out directly in a mixer, (2) a method in which mixing is<br>
carried out as described above, the mixture is molded into pellets using an<br>
extruder, and this molding is then added to resin pellets, (3) a method in which the<br><br>

pellets using a wax, and the pellets thus molded are then added to resin pellets,<br>
and (4) a method in which a paste composition is prepared by mixing and<br>
dispersing the silver-based inorganic antimicrobial agent in a highly viscous liquid<br>
such as a polyol, and this paste is then added to resin pellets.<br>
[0047]<br>
When molding the above-mentioned antimicrobial resin composition, any<br>
known processing techniques and equipment may be used, according to the<br>

temperature and applying an appropriate increased or decreased pressure;<br>
specific operations may be carried out by a standard method, and moldings in<br>
various forms such as lump, sponge, film, sheet, filament, pipe, or a composite<br>

[0070]<br><br>
[0071]<br>
Example 4: Evaluation of molding<br>
The silver-based inorganic antimicrobial agent obtained in Example 1 was<br>
added at 0.15% to a Nylon 6 resin manufactured by Ube Industries, Ltd., and the<br>
mixture was subjected to injection molding at 280°C to give a 2 mm thick plate,<br>
thus giving a molding a. The L/a/b color values of this molding a and its color<br>
difference AE from that of a plate to which no antimicrobial agent had been added<br><br>
were measured using a colorimeter. The results are given in Table 2.<br>
Furthermore, an antimicrobial property test was carried out using this injection-molded plate by a test method in accordance with JIS Z2801 5.2, Plastic<br>
Products, etc. The antimicrobial activity value thus obtained is also given in<br>
Table 2.<br>
Similarly, moldings b and c and comparative moldings d to f were prepared<br>
using the silver-based inorganic antimicrobial agents of Examples 2 and 3 and the<br>
comparative silver-based inorganic antimicrobial agents of Comparative Examples<br>
1 to 3. The color values and the antimicrobial activity of these moldings were<br>
also measured, and the results are given in Table 2.<br>
[0072]<br><br>
[0073]<br>
Example 5: Polyester spinning test<br>
The silver-based inorganic antimicrobial agent prepared in Example 1 was<br>
added at 1O wt % to a polyester resin (MA2103, manufactured by Unitika Ltd.) to<br>
give a master batch. This master batch was then mixed with polyester resin<br>
pellets to give an antimicrobial resin containing 1 wt % of the silver-based<br>
inorganic antimicrobial agent. The antimicrobial resin was subjected to melt<br>
spinning using a multifilament spinning machine at a spinning temperature of<br>
275°C and a windup speed of 400O m/minute, and a 24 filament antimicrobial<br>
agent-containing polyester fiber was wound up in drum form to give an<br>
antimicrobial agent-containing polyester fiber (antimicrobial fiber a). Filament<br>
formation properties were evaluated with respect to filter pressure increase,<br>
filament breakage, and the state of wear of a ceramic guide made of alumina<br><br>
during this process. The results are given in Table 3.<br>
Similarly, an antimicrobial agent-containing polyester fiber (antimicrobial<br>
Tiber 'b) was obtained using the silver-based inorganic antimicrobial agent<br>
prepared in Example 2, Furthermore, an antimicrobial agent-containing<br>
polyester fiber (antimicrobial fiber c) was obtained using the silver-based<br>
inorganic antimicrobial agent prepared in Example 3. Moreover, a comparative<br>
antimicrobial agent-containing polyester fiber (comparative antimicrobial fiber d)<br>
was obtained in the same manner as for antimicrobial fiber a using the<br>
comparative silver-based inorganic antimicrobial agent prepared in Comparative<br>
Example 1. Similarly, a comparative antimicrobial agent-containing polyester<br>
fiber (comparative antimicrobial fiber e) was obtained using the comparative<br>
silver-based inorganic antimicrobial agent prepared in Comparative Example 2,<br>
and a comparative antimicrobial agent-containing polyester fiber (comparative<br>
antimicrobial fiber f) was obtained using the comparative silver-based inorganic<br>
antimicrobial agent prepared in Comparative Example 3.<br>
The target polyester fiber was also prepared in the same manner but<br>
without using a silver-based inorganic antimicrobial agent.<br>
The antimicrobial agent-containing polyester fiber, etc. thus obtained was<br>
scoured, and antimicrobial properties were evaluated. The results are given in<br>
Table 3. The antimicrobial properties were evaluated in accordance with a<br>
quantitative test of JIS L 1902"1998, and the test was carried out using<br>
Staphylococcus aureus. When the microbiostatic activity was equal to or greater<br>
than 2.2, it was evaluated as having antimicrobial properties.<br>
[0074]<br><br><br>
[0075]<br>
As is clear from Table 3, the antimicrobial polyester fiber employing the<br>
antimicrobial agent of the present invention showed less increase in filter pressure,<br>
fewer filament breakages, and little guide wear during spinning, and had excellent<br>
processability when fiber spinning. It can also be seen to have high antimicrobial<br>
properties.<br>
[0076]<br>
From these results, the silver-based inorganic antimicrobial agent of the<br>
present invention has excellent processability such as spinning properties and<br>
also has excellent discoloration resistance when added to a plastic product.<br>
Furthermore, it has been confirmed that the silver-based inorganic antimicrobial<br>
agent of the present invention has a high antimicrobial effect toward various types<br>
of microbes compared with existing silver-based inorganic antimicrobial agents.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
[0077]<br>
Since the novel silver-based inorganic antimicrobial agent of the present<br>
invention is a uniform and fine particulate, it has excellent processability and,<br>
moreover, it has excellent resistance to discoloration of a plastic product and<br>
excellent antimicrobial properties. It is therefore possible to use it as an<br>
antimicrobial agent having high suitability in applications where processability is<br>
important, such as application to fine fibers, paints, etc.<br><br>
