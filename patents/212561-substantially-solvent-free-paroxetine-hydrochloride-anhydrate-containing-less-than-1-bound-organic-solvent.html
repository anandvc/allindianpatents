				<td>The present invention relates to novel compounds, to processes for preparing them and to their use in treating medical disorders.<br>
EP-B-223403 (Beecham Group plc) describes paroxetine hydrochloride hemihydrate and its use in treating certain medical disorders. Example 8 in this document describes the preparation of paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrate as platelets melting at 118°C and with IR bands at 890,1200,1490, 3400 and 3640cm-1, by crystallisation from a water-containing solvent. This material is hereinafter referred to as Form Z. Subsequent repetition of the preparation described in Example 8 has failed to yield any type of paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrate, and there is no clear teaching elsewhere in the document of any alternative route or modification to the process which would generate the anhydrate.<br>
Paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrate is also purported to be disclosed in the International Journal of Pharmaceutics 42, (1988) 135 to 143, published by Elsevier. The anhydrate is said to be produced by crystallising paroxetine hydrochloride from anhydrous propan-2-ol. Subsequent repetition of this process has resulted in a propan-2-ol solvate of paroxetine hydrochloride. That is to say that there is bound propan-2-ol in the product. This bound propan-2-ol cannot be removed by conventional drying techniques such as vacuum oven drying.<br>
Paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrate substantially free of bound propan-2-ol, has not been described in the literature, nor has any method been disclosed which would yield such a product as an inevitable result. A method for preparing paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrate substantially free of bound propan-2-ol has now been found. Furthermore, surprisingly, four new forms of paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrate have been found as have processes for their preparation. These forms are hereinafter referred to as A, B, C and D respectively. The characterising data for the Forms A, B, C and D do not correspond to the characterising data provided in Example 8 of EP-A-223403.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrate substantially free of bound propan-2-ol.<br>
The present invention also provides paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrate substantially free of bound organic solvent.<br>
The present invention also provides paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrate substantially free of propan-2-ol with the proviso that it is other than Form Z.<br>
Substantially free of bound organic solvent is to be interpreted to be less than the amount of propan-2-ol which would remain solvated, i.e., bound, within the crystal lattice of the product under conventional vacuum oven drying conditions.<br>
The present invention also provides paroxetine hydrochloride solvates other than the propan-2-ol solvate as precursors in the preparation of paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrate substantially free of bound organic solvent. Examples of such solvates include solvates from alcohols (other than propan-2-ol) such as propan-1-ol and ethanol; solvates from organic acids such as acetic acid; solvates from organic bases such as pyridine; solvates from nitriles such as acetonitrile; solvates from ketones such as acetone; solvates from ethers such as tetrahydrofuran and solvates from chlorinated hydrocarbons such as chloroform and solvates of hydrocarbons such as toluene.<br>
Preferably, paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrate substantially free of bound propan-2-ol is provided in substantially pure form. Suitably, paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrate substantially free of bound propan-2-ol is provided with a purity of the paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrate -of greater than 50%, preferably greater than 60%, more preferably greater than 70%, yet more preferably greater than 80% and even more preferably greater than 90%. Most preferably the paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrate is provided in substantially pure form, i.e., paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrate substantially free of bound propan-2-ol is greater than 95% pure.<br>
It should be understood that the present invention comprising paroxetine hydochloride anhydrate substantially free of bound propan-2-ol may contain unbound water that is to say water which is other than water of crystallisation.<br>
Typically the amount of bound organic solvent on a weight for weight basis would be less than 2.0%, preferably less than 1.8%, more preferably less than 1.5%, even more preferably less than 1.0%, yet more preferably less than 0.5% and most preferably less than 0.1%.<br>
Generally, all percentages indicated herein are on a weight for weight basis unless otherwise stated.<br>
Preferred forms of paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrate substantially free of bound propan-2-ol or substantially free of bound organic solvent include;<br>
i)   paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrate in Form A; (as hereinafter defined) ii)       paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrate in Form B; (as hereinafter defined) iii) paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrate in Form C; (as hereinafter defined) iv) paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrate in Form D; (as hereinafter defined)<br>
The forms of paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrate may be distinguished from each other and the material formed as a result of carrying out the procedures mentioned in EP-B-0223403 and the International Journal of Pharmaceutics 42, (1988), 135 to 143, by crystalline shape, solvent analysis or techniques such as IR, melting point, X-ray diffraction, NMR, DSC, microscopy and any other analytical techniques which differentiate one form from another.<br>
For example, Form A substantially free of solvent may be distinguished from other forms by the following analytical data. Form A has a melting point of about 123- 125°C when obtained in similar purity to the material described in Example 1 which may be determined by conventional methods such as HPLC and significant IR bands (Figure 1) at about 513, 538,571, 592, 613, 665, 722, 761, 783, 806, 818, 839, 888,906,924,947,966, 982, 1006, 1034,1068, 1091, 1134, 1194, 1221, 1248, 1286,1340, 1387, 1493,1513,1562,1604, 3402, 3631 cm-1.<br>
The DSC exotherm, measured at 10°C per minute shows a maximum at about 126°C using an open pan and a maximum at about 121°C using a closed pan. Form A also has a substantially similar X-ray diffractogram to that shown in Figure 4, for example there are characteristic peaks at 6.6, 8.0, 11.2,13.1 degrees 2 theta and a substantially similar solid state NMR spectrum to that shown in Figure 7 for example with characteristic peaks at 154.3,149.3, 141.6, 138.5 ppm.<br>
Form B substantially free of solvent may be distinguished from other forms by the following analytical data, i.e.it has a melting point of about 138°C when obtained in similar purity to the material described in Example 7 which may be determined by conventional methods such as HPLC and significant IR bands (Figure 2) at about 538, 574, 614, 675,722, 762, 782, 815, 833, 884, 925, 938,970,986, 1006, 1039,1069,1094,1114,1142,1182, 1230, 1274, 1304, 1488, 1510,1574, 1604,1631 cm'1.<br>
The DSC exotherm, measured at 10°C per minute, shows a maximum of about 137°C in both open and closed pans. Form B also has a substantially similar X-ray diffractogram to that shown in Figure 5, for example, there are characteristic peaks at 5.7, 11.3, 12.4, 14.3 degrees 2 theta and a substantially similar solid state NMR spectrum to that shown in Figure 8, for example with characteristics peaks at 154.6,148.3, 150.1, 141.7, 142.7,139.0 ppm.<br>
Form C may be distinguished from other forms by the following analytical data, i.e. it has a melting point of about 164°C when obtain in similar purity to the material described in Example 8 which may be determined by conventional methods such as HPLC and has significant IR bands (Figure 3) at about 540, 574, 615, 674, 720,760, 779, 802, 829, 840, 886, 935,965,984,1007, 1034, 1092, 1109, 1139, 1183, 1218, 1240,1263, 1280, 1507, 1540, 1558, 1598,1652cm-1.<br>
The DSC exotherm, measured at 10°C per minute, shows a maximum of about 161°C in both open and closed pans.<br>
Form C also has a substantially similar X-ray diffractogram to that shown in Figure 6, for example there are characteristic peaks at 10.1, 12.1, 13.1,14.3 degrees 2 theta and a substantially similar solid state NMR spectrum to that in Figure 7, for example with characteristic peaks at 154.0, 148.5,143.4,140.4 ppm.<br>
Form D may be distinguished from other forms by the following analytical data in that it exists as a semi-crystalline solid with a melting point of about 125°C when obtained in similar purity to the material described in Example 14 which may be determined by conventional methods such as HPLC.<br>
Form D may also be characterised in that it has essentially similar physical characteristics when prepared from a toluene precursor solvate using methods generally described herein said toluene precursor solvate having significant IR bands at about 1631,1603, 1555, 1513, 1503, 1489, 1340, 1275, 1240, 1221, 1185,1168,1140,1113, 1101,1076, 1037, 1007,986,968,935, 924, 885, 841, 818,783,760, 742,720, 698, 672, 612, 572, 537 and 465 cm-1, and characteristic X-ray diffraction peaks at 7.2, 9.3,12.7 and 14.3 degrees 2 theta.<br>
The question of which particular form a particular sample of paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrate is would be readily determined by one skilled in the art using conventional techniques with reference to the data provided above that given in the examples and any other conventional means.<br>
Preferably forms A and B exist as needles ad form C exits as needles or prisms.<br>
The present invention also provides a process for the preparation of paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrate substantially free of propan-2-ol which comprises crystallising paroxetine hydrochloride in either;<br>
i)        an organic solvent or mixture of organic solvents which form a solvate with the paroxetine hydrochloride and which are not removable by conventional drying techniques; or<br>
ii)       an organic solvent or mixture or organic solvents which do or do not form a solvate with the paroxetine hydrochloride but which are removable by conventional vacuum oven drying;<br>
thereafter in the case of i) displacing the solvated solvent or solvents using a displacing agent and in the case of ii) by removing the solvent.<br>
The present invention also provides a process for the preparation of the paroxetine hydrochloride solvates other than the propan-2-ol solvate which comprises crystallising<br>
paroxetine hydrochloride in an organic solvent or mixture of solvents which form a solvate with the paroxetine hydrochloride and which are not removable by conventional drying techniques.<br>
The present invention also provides a process for the preparation of paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrate substantially free of bound organic solvent which comprises displacing the solvated solvent or solvents from a paroxetine hydrochloride solvate using a displacing agent.<br>
In one preferred aspect of the invention crystallisation of paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrate is achieved by contacting a solution of paroxetine free base in an organic solvent or solvents with dry hydrogen chloride gas.<br>
Alternatively, prior to the crystallisation of the paroxetine hydrochloride water may be removed by azeotropic distillation. Suitable solvents therefore include those which form an azeotrope with water such as pyridine and propan-2-ol. It should also be appreciated that mixtures of solvents can also be used to aid the azeotropic removal of water.<br>
Thus, in another aspect of the invention paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrate is crystallised by dissolving paroxetine hydrochloride hemi-hydrate in an appropriate solvent substantially free of water which forms an azeotrope with water. Suitably solvent is removed by distillation and fresh solvent substantially free of water is added until all of the water is removed.<br>
Paroxetine hydrochloride hemi-hydrate or the free base thereof may be prepared according to the procedures generally outlined in EP-B-0 223403.<br>
The organic solvents should be substantially free of water to the extent that there is insufficient water present at the time of crystallisation to effect conversion to the hydrochloride hemi-hydrate. Organic solvents which are substantially free of water may be obtained in conventional manner. For example they can be dried using conventional techniques such as drying over molecular sieves or they can be purchased.<br>
Factors which affect which form of the product will be obtained include the particular choice of organic solvent or solvents to be used will depend upon the particular form of the product which is desired.<br>
It should also be appreciated that the method of solvent removal also depends upon the particular form of the product which is desired.<br>
For process variant i) it should be appreciated that an organic solvent or solvents which form a solvate with the crystallised paroxetine hydrochloride and which are not removable by conventional drying techniques may be determined by a matter of routine experimentation. Examples of such organic solvents include, but in no way are limited to, alcohols especially<br>
alkanols such, as propan-2-ol, ethanol and propan-1-ol; organic acids such as acetic acid; organic bases such as pyridine; nitriles such as acetonitrile; ketones such as acetone; ethers such as tetrahydrofuran and chlorinated hydrocarbons such as chloroform.<br>
The paroxetine hydrochloride solvate produced by process variant i) is suitably isolated and dried by conventional methods such as drying in vacuo to remove some or all of the free or unbound solvent. It should be appreciated that it is preferable and unexpected that the degree of drying is controlled such that only free solvent is removed. The bound solvent is then displaced with a displacing agent such as water or supercritical carbon dioxide. It is possible to use other displacing agents which may be selected by means of routine experimentation.<br>
Preferably gaseous or liquid water may be used as a displacing agent. It is important that the paroxetine hydrochloride solvate is contacted with enough water and for sufficient time to displace the solvent but insufficient to cause conversion to the hydrochloride hemi-hydrate.<br>
The amount of water, the form of the water, eg, liquid or gaseous and the length of time which the paroxetine hydrochloride solvate is contacted with the water differs from solvate to solvate. This depends largely upon the solubility of the solvate in question.<br>
Particular ratios of paroxetine hydrochloride solvate to water are outlined in the examples hereinafter described (Examples 1, 4 to 6, 9 to 11,13 and 15). It should be appreciated that the pyridine solvate is believed to be more soluble in water than for example the propan-2-ol solvate. Thus the use of the common ion effect when using diluted hydrochloric acid may help prevent dissolution of the solvate and subsequent conversion to the hydrochloride hemi-hydrate.<br>
After contact with water to displace the bound solvent the product is suitably dried, for example, in vacuo at elevated temperature. Suitable drying may be over a desiccant such as phosphorus pentoxide.<br>
When supercritical carbon dioxide is used it should be appreciated that the flow rate, temperature and pressure of the carbon dioxide may be controlled to give optimum solvent removal from the paroxetine hydrochloride solvate. Generally high pressure carbon dioxide may be used for example at about 2,500 psi. Elevated temperatures may also be preferably used such as between 50 to 80°C. More preferable between 55 to 75°C.<br>
Process variant i) is preferably used to prepare Form A.<br>
Preferably the crystallisation of the paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrate Form A precursor solvate may be facilitated by the addition of seeds of paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrate Form A precursor solvate.<br>
Alternatively, seeds of paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrate Form A may be used to facilitate the crystallisation of paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrate Form A precursor solvates.<br>
For process variant ii) it should be appreciated that an organic solvent or mixture of organic solvents which does or does not form a solvate with the paroxetine hydrochloride but which is removable by conventional vacuum oven drying may be determined by a matter of routine experimentation.<br>
An example of a solvent which forms a bound solvate with the paroxetine hydrochloride but which is removable by conventional vacuum oven drying is toluene.<br>
Toluene is preferably used to prepare Form D.<br>
The crystallisation of paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrate Form D precursor solvates may be facilitated by the addition of seeds of paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrate Form D precursor solvates.<br>
Seeds of paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrate Form D may be used to facilitate the crystallisation of paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrate Form D precursor solvates.<br>
Examples of solvents which do not form a bound solvate with paroxetine hydrochloride but which are removable by conventional vacuum oven drying are butan-1-ol and ethyl acetate.<br>
Butan-1-ol is preferably used to prepare Form B and that butan-1-ol or ethyl acetate are preferably used to prepare Form C.<br>
If Form B is required this may be prepared according to or analogously to the procedures outlined in Example 7.<br>
Preferably the use of seeds of Form B may be used to facilitate the crystallisation of Form B.<br>
If Form C is required this may be prepared according to or analogously to the procedures outlined in Examples 8 and 12.<br>
It should also be appreciated that the use of seeds of Form C may be used to facilitate the crystallisation of Form C.<br>
Seed crystals of Forms A, B, C and D may be prepared according to the procedures described herein or are freely available upon request to Corporate Intellectual Property, SmithKline Beecham plc at New Frontiers Science Park, Third Avenue, Harlow, Essex, CM19 5AW, United Kingdom. Form A is BRL 29060F; Form B is BRL 29060G; Form C is BRL<br>
29060H; Form D is BRL 29060H. Samples of seeds of Forms A, B, C and D may also be obtained from the NCIMB, 23 St. Machor Drive, Aberdeen, AB2 1RY, Scotland, United<br>
Kingdom. <br><br>

EXAMPLE 1<br>
Crystalline Paroxetine Hydrochloride Anhydrate Substantially Free of Bound Propan-2-ol (Form A)<br>
i)        Paroxetine hydrochloride propan-2-ol solvate<br>
Paroxetine hydrochloride hemihydrate [150 g] was stirred with propan-2-ol [1000 ml] and toluene [300 ml] in a round bottom flask and heated to boiling. Solvent was removed by distillation, the total volume being maintained by adding fresh propan-2-ol, until the boiling point had reached approximately 82°C, indicating that all the water had been removed.<br>
The mixture was allowed to cool to approximately 50°C, when it spontaneously crystallised. The contents of the flask rapidly set to a thick paste which was diluted with propan-2-ol [approx. 500 ml] and stirred vigorously. The resulting suspension was allowed to cool to approximately 30°C and filtered under vacuum, taking care to avoid the absorption of atmospheric moisture. The solvent-wet cake was dried in high vacuum over phosphorus pentoxide.<br>
Yield of solvated paroxetine hydrochloride 151 g, propan-2-ol content 13.0% (estimated by NMR).<br>
The infra-red spectrum (Nujol mull) showed inter alia a characteristic band at 667 cm-1, ii)        Paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrate (Form A)<br>
Paroxetine hydrochloride propan-2-ol solvate [110 g, propan-2-ol content 13.0%] was stirred in a beaker with water [275 ml] for 20 minutes. The mixture was filtered under vacuum and the damp solid dried in vacuum over phosphorus pentoxide to constant weight.<br>
Yield of paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrate Form A 91.0 g<br>

Paroxetine Hydrochloride Propan-2-ol Solvate<br>
Paroxetine free base (42.09 g) was dissolved in propan-2-ol (Fisons SLR grade, 210 ml). Hydrogen chloride gas was bubbled into a cooled flask containing propan-2-ol (157 g) until 20.8 g hydrogen chloride had been absorbed. 39 g of this solution (containing approximately 4.6 g hydrogen chloride) was added rapidly to the paroxetine solution and the mixture stirred briskly. After about 1 minute crystallisation began and the mixture rapidly set to an unstirrable paste, which was allowed to stand for one hour. The product was collected by filtration, washed with propan-2-ol (50 ml) and dried under vacuum at ambient temperature to constant weight in a desiccator containing phosphoric oxide. The sample was analysed by NMR spectrometry and found to contain approximately 6% propan-2-ol by weight. Part of the sample was placed in a vacuum oven set at 50°C and further dried to constant weight, which took a further 4 days. NMR spectrometry showed that the sample contained approximately 2% propan-2-ol by weight.<br>
