FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates in general to online travel services and, in particular,<br>
to a system and method for presenting rates for travel services to users online.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Increasing numbers of consumers are taking advantage of network-based, and<br>
Internet-based travel services that offer lodging, transportation reservations and ticketing<br>
directly to customers over the Internet. With such a service, a customer, using a<br>
computer connected to the travel service via the Internet, can purchase travel<br>
services/products from a dynamically changing inventory of services and products, such<br>
as hotel rooms, airline fares, car rentals, etc. Typically, such a travel service cooperates<br>
with a centralized computer reservation system ("CRS"). A CRS is a system/service that<br>
communicates with travel agents or transportation services for the purpose of providing<br>
up-to-date rate plan data, including a room rate (price for a hotel room on a particular<br>
date), fare (price for a trip or combination of routes comprising a trip), schedule (date and<br>
time of arrival and departure of a trip or flight), rules (which room rates and fares are<br>
valid under which circumstances) and availability (capacity for a particular trip or flight<br>
or hotel to provide accommodation at a particular fare or rate) in response to a query.<br>
i This information is provided to the CRS by the lodging provider or transportation<br>
carriers, typically through third parties; however, a travel service can also cooperate with<br>
other databases, such as a local database reflecting specific relationships between carriers<br>
and the travel service, e.g., such as discount contracts or incentive programs.<br>
Accordingly, an Internet-based service can have access to many sources of travel<br>
inventory and prices. The CRS, may also be used to reserve and/or book travel<br>
components in travel packages, i.e., groupings of flight, hotel, car rentals, and or other<br>
travel services/products.<br>
The business environment of a travel service is such that there are numerous ways<br>
of providing the same or a similar end-product to the consumer at a variety of prices.<br>
Due to travel provider-driven preferences, it may be cost-effective to price similar<br>
inventory differently. As an example, in the case of hotel reservations, the pricing<br>
structures are complex and dependent on a number of different variables, including<br>
check-in date, length of stay, availability, etc. Moreover, the prices among hotels can<br><br>
vary greatly depending on the season, events scheduled near the hotel, as well as the<br>
hotel's location and amenities. In the case of airline reservations, the number of ways that<br>
a consumer can travel from point A to point B is great when the number of airline<br>
carriers, different travel paths, hub locations and other particulars are considered. For this<br>
reason, the price of a particular hotel room, or flight segment from point A to point B, or<br>
other travel service/product may vary considerably across time, lodging providers, airline<br>
carriers, and the like.<br>
Further, compounding price variations are price sensitivities, which can reflect,<br>
for example, an increase in demand for rooms reserved proximate to check-in time, or<br>
tickets reserved proximate to departure time. Additionally, incentive and discount<br>
programs negotiated with individual carriers and lodging providers can further affect the<br>
price offered by a travel service. Also, certain classes of room and flight inventory may<br>
have associated high or low demands, or high or low volume sales. Still further, rooms<br>
and flights included in a travel package may be eligible for further discounts over those<br>
not purchased as part of a package.<br>
In addition, there are numerous consumer-driven preferences that can affect<br>
pricing as well. Some consumers will value individual characteristics of a given item of<br>
inventory differently. For example, in a hotel setting some consumer may prefer a<br>
particular hotel company, while others may only consider the location of the hotel. In the<br>
case of airline tickets, a consumer may not value when the flight (flying from one place to<br>
the next) takes place, whereas another consumer may value a particular carrier over all<br>
others. These preferences can be factored into flights offered when the consumer<br>
specifies their preferences. For these reasons and others, there are numerous factors that<br>
can affect the value of the same or similar end-product.<br>
In a conventional Internet-based travel service, a consumer enters very specific<br>
information concerning desired travel provider inventory, such as the type of hotel, and<br>
check-in and check-out dates. The Internet-based travel service queries remote servers<br>
for inventory that matches that specific query. In turn, the remote servers perform<br>
searches of their inventory databases to find matches for the query and return results to<br>
the Internet-based travel service for viewing by the consumer. However, a traditional<br>
remote server search in response to a query is limited.<br>
One limitation results from the fact that previous attempts to present travel service<br>
information online have not always provided accurate real-time pricing and availability to<br><br>
consumers. Even when accurate travel service/product availability and pricing is capable<br>
of being provided in real-time, a still further drawback of previous solutions to providing<br>
travel service information online has been the inability to provide the consumer with<br>
meaningful comparisons between different rooms, flights, and the other services used<br>
while travelling. Obtaining information for individual travel services typically requires<br>
the consumer to navigate numerous Web pages, and only near the end of the process is a<br>
price provided. Most consumers have discovered that it is inconvenient and inefficient to<br>
follow this series of Web pages for various travel services for comparison purposes.<br>
Some travel service providers have sought to address the problem by presenting<br>
pricing and availability information graphically in a weekly or monthly calendar format.<br>
However, the amount of detailed information presented is quite large, and is challenging<br>
for the typical consumer to digest without spending an inordinate amount of time,<br>
particularly when taking into account all of the price variations and sensitivities that can<br>
affect the pricing of a particular travel service/product on any given date. Moreover,<br>
presenting detailed information requires a higher degree of precision in determining the<br>
exact rates that cannot always be achieved in real-time.<br>
In the context of advertising, some travel service providers have sought to address<br>
the problem by presenting pricing information graphically in a color-coded, shaded<br>
weekly or monthly calendar format. However, such information is necessarily static, and<br>
cannot convey up-to-the- minute availability and rate changes that reflect changes in the<br>
market from one day or week to the next.<br>
One embodiment of the invention discloses a method for presenting rates for travel<br>
services, the method comprising the steps of under control of one or more configured<br>
computer systems (106), obtaining a dynamic range of available rates for a travel service<br>
over a selected date range, the rates ranging from a least expensive rate to a most<br>
expensive rate within the obtained rates, subdividing the dynamic range of available rates<br>
between the most expensive and least expensive rates into a plurality of pricing<br>
bands (930A-930E), wherein each of the pricing bands represents a portion of the<br>
dynamic range of available rates, determining an approximate rate for the travel service<br>
based on the pricing band within which an exact rate for the travel service falls and<br>
presenting the approximate rate for the travel service in an interactive interface (365)<br>
using a characteristic (1124, 1638) keyed to the corresponding pricing band, the<br>
characteristic (1124, 1638) including at least one of a graphical and audio characteristic<br>
that conveys a relative expense of the approximate rate for the travel service compared to<br>
other approximate rates for the travel service presented in the same interface.<br><br>
Another embodiment of the invention claims a system (106) for presenting rates for travel<br>
services, the system comprising of a rate generator (460) executing on one or more<br>
computer systems to generate an approximate rate for a travel service based on a pricing<br>
band (930A-930E) associated with a portion of a dynamic range of available rates for the<br>
travel service over a selected date range within which an exact rate for the travel service<br>
falls, wherein the dynamic range of available rates ranges from a least expensive rate to a<br>
most expensive rate, and wherein the pricing band is computed by subdividing the<br>
dynamic range of available rates from between the most expensive and least expensive<br>
rates and an interactive rate interface (365), communicatively coupled to the rate<br>
generator (460), in which to present the approximate rate for the travel service using a<br>
characteristic (1124, 1638) keyed to the associated pricing band, the characteristic (1124,<br>
1638) including at least one of a graphical and audio characteristic that conveys a relative<br>
expense of the approximate rate for the travel service compared to other approximate<br>
rates for the travel service presented in the same interface.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In accordance with the present invention, a-method and system are-provided for presenting rates for travel services using dynamic pricing bands. The dynamic pricing<br>
bands represent approximate rates for travel services relative to available rates during or<br>
close to the proposed dates of travel, or at or near the proposed travel destination. Each<br>
dynamic pricing band is keyed to a particular color, intensity, pattern or other graphical<br>
and/or audio characteristic, thereby providing the consumer a sense of the seasonal,<br>
regional, day of week, or other variability for travel service rates without having to<br>
compare actual numbers. The dynamic pricing bands are applied to an interactive<br>
presentation of rates for travel services to allow the consumer to explore possible rate<br>
variations for particular travel services in a manner that provides a birds-eye view, is<br>
intuitive and user-friendly.<br><br>
In one aspect, the dynamic pricing bands are computed from exact rates for the<br>
travel services using an algorithm in which the least and most expensive available rates<br>
establish a dynamic range of rates that is subdivided into a limited number of bands.<br>
Approximate rates are presented to a consumer using the limited number of bands<br>
according to where the exact rate for a particular travel service falls within the bands,<br>
thereby allowing the consumer to easily compare rates at a glance by comparing the<br>
limited number of bands.<br>
In one aspect, the pricing bands are computed from exact rates available during or<br>
close to the proposed dates of travel, or at or near the travel destination, including exact<br>
rates for the month in which the travel commences plus an additional number of months<br>
to insure that the computed pricing bands represent approximate rates for travel services<br>
that are not unreasonably distorted by seasonal or other variations in the exact rates for a<br>
given travel service. The number of additional months of exact rates included in the<br>
computation of the pricing bands may vary according to the proposed dates of travel<br>
and/or type of travel service to optimize the presentation of approximate rates to the<br>
consumer using dynamic pricing bands.<br>
In yet another aspect, the dynamic pricing bands used in the presentation of rates<br>
are displayed to the.consumer in color, where a different color is used for each pricing<br>
band according to a color key. The different colors may include colors chosen to convey<br>
whether the approximate rate represented by the pricing band is expensive or inexpensive<br>
as compared to other approximate rates represented by other pricing bands. In alternate<br>
embodiments, the computed pricing bands may also be displayed to the consumer using a<br>
 single color of varied intensity, using various patterns, or using other graphical<br>
characteristics, where the level of intensity of the color, pattern, or other graphical<br>
characteristic is similarly chosen to convey whether the approximate rate represented by<br>
the pricing band is expensive or inexpensive as compared to other approximate rates<br>
represented by other pricing bands.<br>
In still another aspect, the rates are presented to the consumer using a calendar<br>
format, where the color, intensity, pattern, or other graphical characteristic chosen for the<br>
dynamic pricing bands are used for the background of the portions of the calendar that<br>
represent a particular date or dates of travel, such as the cells of a calendar presented in a<br>
grid format. In addition, the proposed dates of travel may be further highlighted to set<br>
them off from nearby dates of travel, allowing the consumer to quickly compare the<br><br>
approximates rates for the proposed dates of travel with the approximate rates for nearby<br>
dates, just by comparing the background color, intensity, or pattern of the respective<br>
portions of the calendar.<br>
In yet another aspect, presentation of rates to the consumer using pricing bands<br>
further includes displaying the exact rates for a particular date of travel in response to a<br>
user selection. When the rates are displayed in a rate calendar format, the exact rates<br>
may be displayed to the consumer in response to a user input, such as the selection of the<br>
portion of the calendar that represents a particular date or dates of travel, such as the cells<br>
of a calendar presented in a grid format, or a user input selecting a link to a booking Web<br>
page to book the travel'for the proposed dates of travel.<br>
In another aspect, the rates are presented to the consumer using a map format,<br>
— v—<br>
where the color, intensity, or pattern chosen for the pricing bands are used for the<br>
background of icons depicted in a map that represents particular travel services available<br>
in a particular region. When used to present rates in a map format, the rates that the<br>
dynamic pricing bands represent may include the average lowest daily rate for a travel<br>
service for the selected date or dates relative to the average lowest daily rates for the other<br>
travel services depicted in the map. When the proposed date or dates of travel are<br>
unavailable, the rates that the dynamic pricing bands represent may default to a median<br>
daily rate for travel services relative to the median daily rates for the other services<br>
depicted in the map within a predetermined period of time, e.g., two months. Regardless<br>
of whether average or median rates are used, the dynamic pricing bands are computed<br>
using an algorithm in which the least and most expensive rates establish a dynamic range<br>
-■of rates that is subdivided into a limited number ^of bands. ■ The rates are presented to. a ..--■■•<br>
consumer according to where the rate of a particular travel service falls within the<br>
dynamic pricing bands, thereby allowing the consumer to easily compare rates of travel<br>
services in a given region at a glance by comparing the respective limited number of<br>
pricing bands.<br>
In accordance with yet other aspects of the present invention, a computer-<br>
accessible medium for presenting rates for travel services using pricing bands is provided.<br>
The computer-accessible medium comprises data structures and computer-executable<br>
components comprising a rate presentation system and method, including rate calendar<br>
and rate map processes and interfaces to compute dynamic pricing bands and present<br>
rates for travel services to consumers in a manner that allows consumers to easily and<br><br>
quickly compare rates for travel services using the computed pricing bands. The data<br>
structures define the interfaces, process, rate data and dynamic pricing bands in a manner<br>
that is generally consistent with the above-described system and method. Likewise, the<br>
computer-executable components are capable of performing actions generally consistent<br>
with the above-described system and method.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
FIGURE 1 illustrates an environment for implementing a system for presenting<br>
rates for travel services using pricing bands in accordance with an embodiment of the<br>
present invention. More specifically, FIGURE 1 is a pictorial diagram of a number of<br>
devices connected to an internetwork which provide a client device with a presentation of<br>
- rates for-travel services in response to a traveTquery:- The system-100-generally-operates-<br>
in a distributed computing environment comprising individual computer systems<br>
interconnected over a network (such as the Internet 114). However, it will be appreciated<br>
by those of ordinary skill in the art that the system 100 could equally function as a single,<br>
stand-alone computer system. In the described embodiment, a client device 102, a Web<br>
server 104, a travel server 106, and a map server 110 are interconnected over an<br>
internetwork, such as the Internet 114, or perhaps over an intranetwork. The client<br>
device 102, the Web server 104, travel server 106, and map server 110 are further<br>
described below in relation to FIGURES 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively. The system 100 also<br>
comprises one or more connections to a centralized computer reservation system<br>
(CRS) 112, a system/service for providing up-to-date fare, schedule and availability<br><br>
information for travel services. Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that more<br>
or less devices may be used in the exemplary system 100. For example, the functionality<br>
of the map server 110 may reside on the travel server 106, or some of the functionality of<br>
the travel server 106 may reside on the Web server 104. In still another embodiment,<br>
multiple Web servers 104, and/or travel servers 106 may be used in the system 100.<br>
Additionally, while only one client device 102 has been shown, it will be appreciated that<br>
many client devices may be used in system 100.<br>
FIGURE 2 depicts several of the key components of the client device 102. Those<br>
of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the client device 102 may include many<br>
more components than those shown in FIGURE 2. However, it is not necessary that all<br>
of these generally conventional components be shown in order to disclose an enabling<br>
embodiment for practicing the present invention. As shown in FIGURE 2, the client<br>
device 102 includes a network interface 230 for connecting to the Internet 114. Those of<br>
ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the network interface 230 includes the<br>
necessary circuitry for such a connection, and is also constructed for use with the<br>
Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol ("TCP/IP") protocol or other protocols<br>
such as the Internet Inter-ORB Protocol ("HOP").<br>
The client device 102 also includes a processing unit 210, a display 240, an output<br>
device 245 and a memory 250 all interconnected along with the network interface 230 via<br>
a bus 220. The output device 245 could be any type of device capable of receiving output<br>
from the client device 102, such as, but not limited to, a printer, a smart card reader, a<br>
plotter or a storage mechanism like a floppy, tape or DVD/CD-ROM drive. The<br>
. memory.250. generally- comprises- a- random- .access-memory •(-"RAM"),- a -read-only ■ , -<br>
memory ("ROM") and a permanent mass storage device, such as a disk drive. The<br>
memory 250 stores a Web browser 260 and an operating system 255. It will be<br>
appreciated that these software components may be loaded from a computer-readable<br>
medium into memory 250 of the client device 102 using a drive mechanism (not shown)<br>
associated with the computer-readable medium, such as a floppy, tape or DVD/CD-ROM<br>
drive or via the network interface 230.<br>
Although an exemplary client device 102 has been described that generally<br>
conforms to a conventional general purpose computing device, those of ordinary skill in<br>
the art will appreciate that a client device 102 may be any of a great number of devices<br><br>
capable of communicating with the Internet 114 or with the Web server 104, e.g., a<br>
personal digital assistant, a workstation, a cell phone, a laptop, etc.<br>
FIGURE 3 depicts several of the key components of the Web server 104. Those<br>
of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the Web server 104 includes many more<br>
components then those shown in FIGURE 3. However, it is not necessary that all of<br>
these generally conventional components be shown in order to disclose an enabling<br>
embodiment for practicing the present invention. As shown in FIGURE 3, the Web<br>
server 104 is connected to the Internet 114 via a network interface 330. Those of<br>
ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the network interface 330 includes the<br>
necessary circuitry for connecting the Web server 104 to the Internet 114, and is also<br>
constructed for use with the TCP/IP protocol or other protocols, such as the HOP, the<br>
particular network configuration of the operating environment in which it is contained<br>
and a particular type of coupling medium.<br>
The Web server 104 also includes a processing unit 310, an optional display 340,<br>
and a mass memory 350 all interconnected along with the network interface 330 via a<br>

necessary for receiving, processing, formatting, requesting and sending rates for travel<br>
services, as well as, supplying the results of that processing to other devices such as the<br>

interactive presentation of approximate rates for travel services to consumers using<br>
pricing bands in a calendar 370 or map 375 format in accordance with an embodiment of<br>
the present invention. The travel services may be any type of services related to travel,<br>
including but not limited to lodging and transportation. The rate interface process 365 is<br>

Although an exemplary Web server 104 has been described that generally<br>
conforms to a conventional general purpose computing device, those of ordinary skill in<br>

capable of communicating via the Internet 114, or providing Web pages in a network.<br>
FIGURE 4 depicts several of the key components of the travel server 106. Those<br>

bands in a calendar 465 or a map 470 format, as shown and described in further detail<br>
with reference to FIGURES 7A-7C and FIGURES 15A-15B, respectively. Briefly, the<br>

services using pricing bands in response to a consumer request for rates for travel services<br>
during a particular time period, or in a particular location, according to the consumer's<br>

memory 550 stores a map service 560 to render and serve an interactive map of a travel<br>
destination and surrounding area, including icons for travel services in the travel<br>
destination and surrounding area, in response to a request from another device such as the<br>

To better illustrate the presentation of rates for travel services to a consumer using<br>
pricing bands using a calendar interface, FIGURE 6 is a diagram illustrating one<br>
embodiment of interactions taken by the devices of system 100 illustrated in FIGURE 1<br>
to present rates for travel services using pricing bands in a calendar format in response to<br>
a travel query in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. While lodging<br>
services are used below to describe an illustrative travel service for which rates are<br>
presented using pricing bands according to an embodiment of the present invention, those<br>
of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the present invention applies equally well<br>
to other types of travel services, such as, but not limited to, air, train, bus, cruise, ferry or<br>
other forms of transportation services. The devices of the system 100 illustrated in<br>
FIGURE 6 include a client device 102, Web server 104, and a travel server 106,<br>
respectively, and an inventory database 108 that may be accessible directly, or indirectly<br>
through a CRS 112, as described with reference to FIGURE 1. The interactions of and<br>
	the- processes performed by the- various devices• are illustrated and described in- greater - --=-<br>
detail with reference to FIGURES 7A-7C.<br>
Returning to FIGURE 6, the presentation of rates for travel services to a consumer<br>
using pricing bands is initiated at interactions 610, 620 when a Web server 104 relays a<br>
consumer's selection of a hotel room and, optionally, the proposed dates of travel, such as<br>
the check-in and check-out dates, or the current date as the default, from the client<br>
device 102 to the travel server 106 via an interactive rate calendar interface (such as the<br>
rate calendar interface 1100 illustrated in FIGURE 11) that is accessible to the client<br>
device 102 and is hosted on the Web server 104.<br>
At interaction 630, once the travel server 106 receives the consumer's selections,<br>
the travel server 106 calls a cache of the inventory database 108 to obtain rate plan data<br><br>
associated with the hotel room and proposed dates of travel selections. At<br>
interaction 640, the travel server 106 retrieves the rate plan data from the cache, starting<br>
with the check-in month plus an additional number of months of rate plan data in<br>
accordance with the rules set forth in detail and further described below with reference to<br>
FIGURE 8. In a typical example, the travel server 106 retrieves six months of rate plan<br>
data for the selected travel service (e.g., the selected hotel room) starting with the rate<br>
plan data for the proposed check-in month. However, other amounts of rate plan data<br>
may be retrieved from the cache, either arbitrarily or depending on the type of travel<br>
service or proposed dates.<br>
At interaction 650, the travel server 106 cornputes a limited number of pricing<br>
bands from the rate plan data that was retrieved from the cache according to a pricing<br>
band algorithm, as set forth in detail and further described below with reference to<br>
FIGURE 9. In general, the pricing bands represent dynamic ranges of rates computed<br>
from the least and most expensive rates in the retrieved rate plan data. In one<br>
embodiment, the pricing bands are generally limited in number to no more than five (5)<br>
or so bands to facilitate easy comparison of rates by the consumer. However, the number<br>
may vary depending on the implementation. For example, when using the bands to<br>
represent rates for travel services that are particularly volatile, such as airfares, the<br>
number of pricing bands may increase or decrease to accommodate larger ranges or<br>
smaller ranges of rates. At interaction 660, the travel server 106 combines the computed<br>
pricing bands with an interactive rate calendar interface to allow the consumer to explore<br>
the possible rate variations for the selected travel service in an intuitive and user-friendly<br>
	manner,--As-will-be-further described with reference to - FIGURES 7A-7C,. the travel- —••<br>
server 106 generates the cells for each date of the month or months that are to be<br>
displayed in the interactive rate calendar, and associates a particular computed pricing<br>
band with each cell depending on where the exact rate for each date falls within the<br>
dynamic ranges of the bands.<br>
At interaction 670, the Web server applies a graphical characteristic to the cells<br>
based on the computed pricing band associated with the cell as described in further detail<br>
below with reference to FIGURE 10. In a typical embodiment, the graphical<br>
characteristic is a color chosen to convey whether the approximate rate for a travel<br>
service on a particular date (a calendar cell) is expensive or inexpensive as compared to<br>
rates on other dates (other cells).<br><br>
FIGURES 7A-7C are overview flow diagrams illustrating logic implemented<br>
using the devices of system 100 illustrated in FIGURE 1 to present rates for travel<br>
services in a calendar format in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
A rate presenter process 700 implemented by the travel server 106 begins in block 702<br>
and continues at process block 704 to receive the consumer's selection of a travel service,<br>
such as a standard king bed hotel room in the ABC Hotel, and optionally, the desired<br>
reservation date, such as a check-in date of May 1, 2004 for one week, checking out on<br>
May 8, 2004. At decision block 706 the rate presenter process 700 determines whether<br>
the consumer's selection is dated or undated. If undated, at process block 708 the rate<br>
presenter process 700 defaults to the current date. At process block 712, the rate<br>
presenter process 700 determines which months of the rate plan data for the consumer's<br>
selected travel service to obtain from a cache of rate plan data obtained from the<br>
inventory database 108. The cache is a subset of the rate plan data that is stored in<br>
memory 450 and periodically refreshed to facilitate rapid access to current rate plan data<br>
while minimizing database access delays. The amount of rate plan data stored in the<br>
cache at any given time is typically six months, although the cache may contain more or<br>
less than six months of data depending on the implementation. The determination of<br>
which months of the rate plan data to obtain is set forth in further detail in FIGURE 8.<br>
FIGURE 8 is a table summarizing an example of determining which rate data to<br>
include in the computation of the dynamic pricing bands used in the presentation of rates<br>
for travel services in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. As<br>
illustrated, the example is for a six-month cache of data, and summarizes which months<br>
- -are displayed inthe rate calendar. 820, and which-monthsare included in the -computation- ■-..■■■&gt;■■<br>
of the dynamic pricing bands 830, based on the consumer's selection of check-in<br>
month 810. For example, in a dated search, when the check-in month occurs in the first<br>
month, Ml, of the six-month cache, at *-0A, the months that will be displayed in the rate<br>
calendar, i.e., the display months, are the first and second months of the cache, Ml and<br>
M2, and the months that will be used in computing the pricing bands, i.e., the pricing<br>
band months, are the first through sixth months, Ml through M6. Similarly, when the<br>
check-in month occurs in the second month, M2, of the six-month cache, at 840B, the<br>
display months are the second and third months of the cache, M2 and M3, and the pricing<br>
band months are the first through sixth months, Ml through M6. When the check-in<br>
month occurs in the third through fifth month, the rate data is included in a manner<br><br>
similar to when the check-in month occurs in the first and second months. However,<br>
when the check-in month occurs in the sixth month, the determination of display months<br>
and computation months depends on whether the check-out month occurs within the six-<br>
month cache or is outside the cache. When the check-out month also occurs within the<br>
sixth month, at 840F, the display months are the fifth and sixth months of the cache, M5<br>
and M6, and the pricing band months are again the first through sixth months, Ml<br>
through M6. However, when the check-out month occurs beyond the sixth month<br>
(outside of the cache), at 840G, the sixth month of the cache will be displayed in the rate<br>
calendar, M6, as well as the seventh month, M7, but without data in any of the cells of<br>
the seventh month. The months used in computing the pricing bands are again the first<br>
through sixth months, Ml through M6.<br>
When the check-in month occurs in the seventh month beyond the sixth month of<br>
the cache, the display months are the sixth and seventh months, M6 and M7, but will be<br>
displayed without data in any of the cells of either month. The pricing band months are<br>
the first through sixth months, Ml through M6, plus optionally an additional month of<br>
data, M7, obtained directly from the inventory database 108, i.e., not from the cache.<br>
When the check-in month occurs in the eighth through' twelfth month, M8 to Ml 2,<br>
at 8401, then the display months are again the sixth and seventh months, M6 and M7, but<br>
again without data in any of the cells of either month. Moreover, no attempt to compute<br>
pricing bands is made. Lastly, when the selection of the consumer is undated, i.e., no<br>
check-in date or proposed date of travel was specified, then the check-in month will<br>
default to the month of the current date, and the months used in the display and<br>
■ .■.computation.ofthe-pricing bands, are-determined accordingly. ........... , -.-..• „,-.-. „.;..,,........	<br>
Returning now to FIGURE 7A, once the amount of available rate plan data to use<br>
in the computation of the pricing bands has been determined, at process block 714, the<br>
rate presenter process 700 obtains the least expensive, "L," rate from the available rate<br>
plan data, and, likewise, at process block 716, the most expensive, "M," rate. At process<br>
block 718, the rate presenter process 700 subtracts the least expensive rate from the most<br>
expensive rate to obtain a range of rates, "R," i.e., R = M - L. The rate presenter<br>
process 700 continues at FIGURE 7B, at process block 722, to compute the dynamic<br>
pricing bands using the obtained values for the least and most expensive rates and the<br>
resulting range, L, M, and R, according to an N-band algorithm, an example of which is<br>
illustrated in detail in FIGURE 9. In a preferred embodiment, the pricing band<br><br>
representing the least expensive rates is not actually a range of values, but rather te least<br>
expensive rate, L. The remaining pricing bands are ranges of values computed using the<br>
values for L and R in the N-band algorithm, as generally expressed in the following<br>
equation:<br>
[L + (x-l*(R/N-l)) + l] TO fL + (je*(R/N-l))],<br>
where x = 1 to N-l, and N is the number of pricing bands.<br>
In the example illustrated in FIGURE 9, the number of dynamic pricing bands 910<br>
is five (5), where Band I, 930A, is used for rates equal to the least expensive rate, L, Band<br>
II, 930B, is used for rates ranging from L + 1 to [L + l*(R/4)], Band III, 930C, is used for<br>
rates ranging from L + (l*(R/4)) + 1] to [L + (2*(R/4))], Band IV, 930D, is used for rates<br>
ranging from L + (2*(R/4)) + 1] to [L + (3*(R/4))], and Band V, 930E, is used for rates<br>
ranging from L + (3*(R/4)) + 1] to [L + (4*(R/4))]. An example computation of five<br>
pricing bands using actual rate plan data will be further described below with reference to<br>
FIGURE 10.<br>
Returning now to FIGURE 7B, at process block 724, the rate presenter<br>
process 700 assigns a graphical characteristic to each of the computed pricing bands, such<br>
as a particular color, that will graphically differentiate for the consumer in an easily<br>
accessible manner which rates for the travel service are expensive, and which are not,<br>
relative to the rates for other dates proximate to the proposed dates of travel. FIGURE 10<br>
illustrates a table 1000 summarizing an example of applying colors to represent dynamic<br>
pricing bands in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. In the<br>
illustrated example, the available rate plan data obtained from the cache is subdivided<br>
	into-five pricing bands,--where the least expensive rate,-L,-is-determined-to-be.$150 and- -----<br>
the most expensive rate, M, is $250, resulting in a total range, R, of $100. As shown,<br>
Band I, 1020A, uses the lightest shade of the color green for rates equal to the least<br>
expensive rate, L, of $150. Band II, 1020B, uses a medium shade of green for rates<br>
ranging from $151 to ($150 + 25), or $151 to $175. Band III, 1020C, uses a medium-<br>
dark shade of green for rates ranging from $176 to ($150 + 50), or $176 to $200.<br>
Band IV, 1020D, uses a dark shade of green for rates ranging from $201 to ($150 + 75),<br>
or $201 to $225. Lastly, Band V, 1020E, uses the darkest shade of green for the most<br>
. expensive rates ranging from $226 to ($150 + $100), or $226 to $250. Although the<br>
illustrated example uses different shades of the same color to differentiate one pricing<br>
band from another, another graphical characteristic could have been used with equal<br><br>
success, such as different colors altogether, e.g., green for the least expensive, and red for<br>
the most expensive, or different patterns of black and white to accommodate<br>
monochromatic display screens. In one embodiment, the choice of which type of<br>
graphical characteristic to use for each pricing band is delayed until the rates are<br>
presented to the client device, permitting the choice to identify a particular brand of travel<br>
service provider.<br>
Returning now to FIGURE 7B, the rate presenter process 700 continues at process<br>
block 726 to generate the cells for each date in the months that will be displayed in the<br>
rate calendar interface, where the generation of each cell is based on where the exact rate<br>
for each date falls within the dynamic ranges of the computed pricing bands. In one<br>
embodiment, the appropriate computed pricing band is associated with the cell, but does<br>
not affect the appearance of the cell until the rate calendar interface is actually rendered<br>
on the client device to allow the selection of color or other graphical characteristic to<br>
identify the particular brand of travel service provider that the consumer is using.<br>
The rate presenter process 700 continues at process block 730 to obtain from the<br>
cached rate plan data the exact daily rates for the proposed dates of travel selected by the<br>
consumer (or the default current date if the consumer's travel service selection was<br>
undated). In one embodiment, the exact daily rates for the proposed dates of travel are<br>
posted alongside the monthly calendar display to provide the user with detailed exact<br>
rates in addition to the approximate rates represented by the dynamic pricing band colors<br>
applied to the monthly calendar display. At process block 732, the rate presenter<br>
process 700 further highlights the cells that represent the proposed dates of travel selected<br>
. - by-the consumer (or- the default current date if the consumer's travel-service selection- was — .•<br>
undated).<br>
Once the interactive rate calendar has been generated, at process block 734 the<br>
rate presenter process 700 displays, or causes the display, of the interactive rate calendar<br>
on a client device 102 for the consumer. An example of an interactive rate calendar<br>
interface is illustrated in FIGURE 11, at reference numeral 1100. The illustrated rate<br>
calendar interface 1100 shows a rate calendar for the ABC Hotel, 1102, for the selected<br>
travel service of a Studio One Full room, 1108, displayed as available, 1114, for proposed<br>
dates in May, with a check-in date of Saturday, May 1, 2004, and a check-out date of<br>
May 8, 2004, shown at 1104, 1108. A room description is optionally displayed at 1116,<br>
with a link to a virtual tour of. the room's amenities at 1118. In the detailed information<br><br>
appearing across the top of the rate calendar interface 1100, the exact rates for the<br>
proposed dates of travel are displayed in a weekly format, with the Saturday 5/1/2004 rate<br>
of $194, the Sunday 5/2 - Monday 5/3 rate of $154, the Tuesday 5/4 rate of $144, the<br>
Wednesday 5/5 - Friday 5/7 rate of $194, for an average rate per night of $148.<br>
Should the consumer wish to compare how the rates for the proposed dates of<br>
travel compare with other nearby dates, a Hide/Display Rate Calendar link at 1120 may<br>
be activated to toggle to the displayed months of the rate calendar interface 1100. As<br>
shown, the two displayed months are the month in which the check-in date occurs,<br>
May 2004, at 1134, and the next month, June 2004, at 1132. Detailed information<br>
appearing across the top of the rate calendar interface 1100 is repeated in a tabular format<br>
at 1128 alongside the two displayed months. Appearing near the two displayed months is<br>
a pattern key 1124 depicting five (5) different patterns used to represent five (5) different<br>
pricing bands, such as the previously described Bands I -V in FIGURES 9-10, where the<br>
pattern appears in the background of each date in the calendar to indicate whether the cost<br>
of the room is less or more cost per night as compared to the other displayed dates in the<br>
two displayed monthly calendars. In this example, the pricing bands were computed<br>
from six months of cached data, from May 2004 through October 2004.<br>
Also appearing near the two displayed months is an availability key 1134<br>
depicting an X used to mark those dates that are unavailable. As is shown in the two<br>
displayed months, certain dates are encoded as unavailable, including May 24,<br>
May 28-30, and June 25-27. For the proposed dates of travel, May 1 through May 8, the<br>
rates for three of the days, namely Saturday, May 1, and Wednesday through Friday, May<br>
.-•5-through May-.,?-,-fall-within Band IV,-and.are so-encoded-with-the pattern for-Band IV.	<br>
Similarly, the rates for Sunday through Monday, May 2 through May 3, fall within<br>
Band III, and are so encoded with the pattern for Band III. The rate for Tuesday, May 4,<br>
is the least expensive of the rates, falling within Band II, and is so encoded with the<br>
pattern for Band II. In one embodiment, the proposed dates of travel are highlighted on<br>
the calendar, illustrated here as an emphasis on the outlines of the cells representing the<br>
proposed dates of travel. However, the highlighting may be accomplished using any<br>
graphical characteristic that calls attention to that portion of the screen in which the cells<br>
representing the proposed dates of travel appear.<br>
In actual use of the rate calendar interface 1100 appearing in FIGURE 11, the<br>
consumer can easily see that if they were to delay their travel to the following week in<br><br>
May, they could take advantage of the lowest rate for the selected room (or at least the<br>
lowest rate relative to the rates for the period corresponding to the six months of cached<br>
rate plan data that was used to compute the dynamic pricing bands). This is because the<br>
rates beginning on Sunday, May 9 through Wednesday, May 19, apparently fall with<br>
B#nd I, and are so encoded with the pattern for Band I (which, in this example, is the<br>
absence of a pattern). The consumer can also easily grasp at a glance, that the more<br>
expensive rates occur in the following month, the month of June, at 1132, probably due to<br>
seasonal variation in demand for rooms in the ABC Hotel.<br>
Another example of the rate calendar interface is illustrated in FIGURE 12, in the<br>
same ABC Hotel 1202, this time for a different selected travel service of a Standard King<br>
room 1208, displayed as available at 1214, for same proposed dates in May, with a check-<br>
in date of Saturday, May 1, 2004, and a check-out date of May 8, 2004, shown at 1204<br>
and 1210. As in the interface 1100 in FIGURE 11, a room description is optionally<br>
displayed at 1216, with a link to a virtual tour of the room's amenities at 1218. In the<br>
detailed information appearing across the top of the rate calendar interface 1200, the<br>
exact rates for the proposed dates of travel are displayed in a weekly format, with the<br>
Saturday 5/1/2004 rate of $230, the Sunday 5/2 - Monday 5/3 rate of $188, the Tuesday<br>
5/4 rate of $180, the Wednesday 5/5 - Friday 5/7 rate of $230, for an average rate per<br>
night of $211, significantly higher than the rate for the Studio One Full room in the same<br>
hotel for the same proposed dates of travel Thus, the consumer can easily determine at a<br>
glance by selecting a different type of room, the cost of upgrading to a nicer room in the<br>
same hotel for the same dates of travel.<br>

consumer input to the interactive rate calendar interface 1100 at decision blocks 738, 740,<br>
and 742. For example, at decision block 738, should the consumer wish to explore rates<br>
for months other than the display months already viewed in the rate calendar<br>
interface 1100 illustrated in FIGURE 11, the consumer may click the links provided<br>
at 1106 and 1138 to change the proposed dates of travel, or may simply navigate the<br>
display months using the navigational arrows at 1140 and 1142 to go back and forth.<br>
However, should the new proposed dates of travel cause a change in the determination of<br>
pricing band months, as previously described with reference to FIGURE 8, for purposes<br>
of computing the dynamic pricing bands, then, referring back to FIGURE 7C, the rate<br>
presenter process 700 branches to the beginning of the process in FIGURE 7A, at process<br><br>
block 712 so that the pricing band months may be re-determined and pricing bands re-<br>
computed. Referring again to FIGURE 7C, should only the dates change, but not the<br>
pricing band months, then the rate presenter process 700 branches instead to FIGURE IB<br>
at process block 730 to obtain the exact daily rates for the new proposed dates of travel<br>
and to refresh the rate calendar interface 1100 to display the detailed information and<br>
highlight the proposed dates accordingly.<br>
An example of changing the months of proposed travel is illustrated in<br>
FIGURE 13, in which the proposed dates of travel for the same Studio One Full room<br>
selected in the original example illustrated in FIGURE 11, is now June 12 through June<br>
19. The display months are now June and July, beginning with the month of June at 1330<br>
instead of the month of May at 1130. For the proposed dates of travel, June 12 through<br>
June 19, the rates for three of the days, namely Saturday, June 12, and Wednesday<br>
through Friday, June 16 through June 18, fall within Band V, and are so encoded.<br>
Similarly, the rates for Sunday through Monday, June 13 through June 14, fall within<br>
Band IV, and are so encoded. As before, the rate for Tuesday, June 15, is the least<br>
expensive of the rates, falling within Band III, and is so encoded. Although the ranges<br>
for the pricing bands has moved upwards, reflecting higher rates, the relationship of the<br>
day of week variations in pricing remains the same as before, as is readily appreciated<br>
from the appearance of the approximate rates encoded with the corresponding pricing<br>
bands in each date of the displayed calendar months, June and July, at 1330 and 1332<br>
respectively. The consumer can also easily see, at a glance, that the rates for travel are<br>
increasing as the seasonal price variations for the popular months of summer travel take<br>
. - ~.hold,-.resulting-in. more dates encoded- with -the more- expensive pricing bands, Band TV<br>
and Band V during the month of July, at 1332, than in the month of June, at 1330.<br>
Returning now to FIGURE 7C, should the consumer wish to book travel for the<br>
proposed dates, at decision block 742 the rate presenter process 700 determines whether<br>
the consumer has activated the book travel link, an example of which is illustrated in<br>
FIGURES 11, 12, and 13, at 1136, 1236, and 1336, respectively. If so, the rate presenter<br>
process 700 branches at process block 744 to a detailed rate page (not illustrated), and<br>
proceeds to book the travel in accordance with the consumer input. At process block 746,<br>
the rate presenter process 700 terminates.<br>
To better illustrate the presentation of rates for travel services to a consumer using<br>
pricing bands in combination with a map interface, FIGURE 14 is a diagram illustrating<br><br>
one embodiment of interactions taken by the devices of system 100 illustrated in<br>
FIGURE 1 to present rates for travel services using p icing bands in a map format in<br>
response to a travel query in accordance with an embe .liment of the present invention.<br>
The devices of the system 100 illustrated in FIGURE 14 include a client device 102, Web<br>
server 104, a travel server 106, and a map server 11 ), respectively, and an inventory<br>
database 108 that may be accessible directly, or indirectly through a CRS 112, as<br>
described with reference to FIGURE 1. The interacti jns of and the processes performed<br>
by the various devices are illustrated and describee", in greater detail with reference to<br>
FIGURES 15A-15B.<br>
Returning to FIGURE 14, the presentation of rates for travel services to a<br>
consumer using pricing bands is initiated at interactions 1410, 1420, when a Web<br>
server 104 relays a consumer's selection of a travel destination and particular travel<br>
service in a travel destination and, optionally, the proposed dates of travel, such as the<br>
check-in and check-out dates, or if no date has been proposed, the current date as the<br>
default, from the client device 102 to the travel server 106 via an interactive rate map<br>
interface (such as the rate map interface 1600 illustrated in FIGURE 16) that is accessible<br>
to the client device 102 and is hosted on the Web server 104.<br>
At interaction 1430, once the travel server 106 receives the consumer's selections,<br>
the travel server 106 calls a cache of the inventory database 108 to obtain rate plan data<br>
associated with travel services at or near the travel destination for the proposed date or<br>
dates. At interaction 1440, the travel server 106 retrieves the rate plan data from the<br>
cache, starting with the check-in month plus an additional number of months of rate plan<br>
.. data in. accordance, with-the. -rules, set .forth in-detaiL and-further described-below- with --<br>
reference to FIGURE 8. In a typical example, the travel server 106 retrieves two months<br>
of rate plan data for the travel services at or near the selected travel destination, starting<br>
with the rate plan data for the proposed check-in month. If the selection is undated, the<br>
check-in month 'defaults to the current month. However, other amounts of rate plan data<br>
may be retrieved from the cache, either arbitrarily or depending on the proposed dates of<br>
travel.<br>
At interaction 1450, the travel server 106 computes a limited number of pricing<br>
bands from the rate plan data that was retrieved from the cache according to a pricing<br>
band algorithm, as set forth in detail previously described with reference to FIGURE 9.<br>
Since each hotel is likely to offer a number of different rates for their services depending<br><br>
on the type of room and length of stay, and no particular room within the hotel is<br>
typically specified when using the map interface, in o le embodiment the travel server 106<br>
computes the average of the lowest daily rates for each hotel for which rate plan data was<br>
retrieved from the cache, and uses each hotel's average in the computation of the limited<br>
number of pricing bands instead of the exact rate for u particular room on a particular date<br>
as was done previously. In an alternate embodiment, such as when the consumer's<br>
selection is undated, the travel server 106 uses the median daily rate for each hotel in the<br>
computation of the limited numbvr of pricing bands, instead of the average lowest rate.<br>
Similar to the calendar implementation, the pricing bands represent dynamic ranges of<br>
rates computed from the least and most expensive of the median or average lowest daily<br>
rate for each hotel, or other type of travel service. The pricing bands are generally limited<br>
in number to no more than five (5) or so bands to facilitate easy comparison of rates by<br>
the consumer, but the number may vary depending on the implementation.<br>
At interaction 1460, the travel server 106 requests a map from the map server 110.<br>
The map server 110 is typically a third party provider of map interfaces for a specified<br>
area, such as the travel destination selected by the consumer. At interaction 1470, the<br>
map server 110 renders a map interface of the travel destination, including icons<br>
corresponding to the hotels at or near the travel destination for which rate plan date was<br>
retrieved from the cache. The rendered map interface is relayed to the travel server 106.<br>
At interaction 1480, the travel server 106 combines the computed pricing bands with the<br>
rendered map interface to allow the consumer to explore the possible rate variations for<br>
comparable travel services in the selected travel destination in an intuitive and user-<br>
.—friendly^manner. As-will. be.further, described.with reference to FIGURES45A-15B; the -,,<br>
travel server 106 associates a particular computed pricing band with each icon depending<br>
on where the rate for the travel service that the icon represents falls within the dynamic<br>
ranges of the bands.<br>
At interaction 1490, the Web server applies a graphical characteristic to the<br>
rendered icons on the map based on the computed pricing band associated with the icon<br>
as described previously with reference to FIGURE 10. Similar to the rate calendar<br>
interface, in a typical embodiment of the rate map interface, the graphical characteristic is<br>
a color chosen to convey whether the approximate rate for a particular hotel at or near the<br>
travel destination (as represented in the map icon) is expensive or inexpensive as<br><br>
compared to rates for other hotels at or near the travel destination (other icons on the<br>
same map).<br>
FIGURES 15A-15B are overview flow diagrams illustrating logic implemented<br>
using the devices of system 100 illustrated in FIGURE 1 to present rates for travel<br>
services in a map format in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. A<br>
rate presenter process 1500 implemented by the travel server 106 begins in block 1502<br>
and continues at process block 704 to receive, the consumer's selection of a travel<br>
destination, such as San Diego, California, and optionally, a particular hotel and/or<br>
reservation date, such as the ABC Hotel, with a check-in date of May 1, 2004. At process<br>
block 1506 the rate presenter process 1500 determines which months of the rate plan data<br>
for hotels at or near the consumer's selected travel destination to retrieve from the cache<br>
of rate plan data obtained from the inventory database 108. The determination of which<br>
months of the rate plan data to retrieve is set forth in further detail as previously described<br>
with reference to FIGURE 8.<br>
Once the rate plan data has been retrieved, at process block 1508 the rate<br>
presenter process 1500 determines which rates to use in the computation of the pricing<br>
bands. When the consumer's selection of a travel destination is undated, a preferred<br>
default rate to use in the pricing band computation is the median daily rate within a<br>
predefined period (typically two months beginning with the current month) for each hotel<br>
in the travel destination that will be displayed on the map. This insures that the consumer<br>
is comparing rates that are most likely to be comparable from one hotel to the next.<br>
Alternatively, when the consumer's selection of a travel destination is dated, i.e., has<br>
.. -selected-a check-in- date and-possibly.a.check-out-date,4hen a preferred rate.to use in-the—--<br>
pricing band computation is an average of the lowest daily rate for each travel service for<br>
each of the selected dates. Using the average of the lowest daily rates for a selected date<br>
or dates will generally provide the consumer with a more accurate sense of the rates that<br>
are available during the selected dates than just using the median daily rate.<br>
Once the type of rate to use has been determined, at process block 1510, the rate<br>
presenter process 1500 obtains the least expensive, "L," rate from the available rate plan<br>
data. For example, when using the average of the lowest daily rates for a selected date or<br>
dates, the least expensive "L" rate is the least expensive of the average lowest daily rates<br>
among all of the hotel in the selected travel destination, i.e., the lowest of the average<br>
lowest rates. When using the median daily rate occurring during a two-month period, the<br><br>
least expensive "L" rate is the least expensive of the median daily rates among all of the<br>
hotels in the selected travel destination, i.e., the lowest of the n edian rates. Likewise, at<br>
process block 1512, the rate presenter process 1500 obtains the most expensive, "M," rate<br>
from the available rate plan data in a similar manner. At process block 1514, the rate<br>
presenter process 1500 subtracts the least expensive rate from the most expensive rate to<br>
obtain a range of rates, "R," i.e., R = M - L. The rate presenter process 1500 conunues at<br>
FIGURE 15B, at process block 1516, to compute the dy.iamic pricing bands using the<br>
obtained values for the least and most expensive rate? and the resulting range, L, M,<br>
and R, according to an N-band algorithm, an example of which has been illustrated and<br>
previously described in detail in FIGURE 9.<br>
Returning now to FIGURE 15B, at process block 1520, the rate presenter<br>
process 1500 assigns a graphical characteristic to each of the computed pricing bands,<br>
such as a particular color, that will graphically differentiate for the consumer in an easily<br>
accessible manner which rates for a hotel are expensive, and which are not, relative to the<br>
rates for other hotels at or near the selected travel destination. As previously described,<br>
FIGURE 10 illustrates a table 1000 summarizing an example of applying colors to<br>
represent dynamic pricing bands in accordance with an embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Returning now to FIGURE 15B, the rate presenter process 1500 continues at<br>
process block 1522 to request a map of the selected travel destination as well as icons<br>
corresponding to the hotels at or near the selected travel destination appropriately<br>
geographically positioned on the map. In one embodiment, the map and icons are<br>
--requested -from- -a-third- party, map provider-by-the .associated-longitude -and latitude - -.--<br>
geographical designations associated with the selected destination and hotels.<br>
The rate presenter process 1500 continues at process block 1524 to combine the<br>
computed pricing bands with the map by associating a pricing band with each icon on the<br>
map based on where the rate for the hotel (e.g., the lowest or the average of the lowest<br>
daily rate for the hotel, as the case may be) falls within the dynamic ranges of the<br>
computed pricing bands. The rate presenter process 1500 may also at this time apply the<br>
assigned graphical characteristics to the icons. In one embodiment, the assignment and<br>
application of the graphical characteristic to the icons is delayed until the rate map<br>
interface is actually rendered on the client device to allow the selection of the color or<br><br>
other graphical characteristic to identify the particular brand of travel service provider<br>
that the consumer is using.<br>
Once the interactive rate map and icons have been generated, at process<br>
block 1526 the rate presenter process 1500 displays, or causes the display, of the<br>
interactive rate map interface 1600 on a client device 102 for the consumer. An example<br>
of an interactive rate map interface is illustrated in FIGURE 16, at reference<br>
numeral 1600. The illustrated rate map interface 1600 entitled "Lodging in Beach Cities<br>
(San Diego)" at 1602, in which a hotel map view 1604 tabbed display has been selected<br>
that includes an area map 1614 for the travel destination of San Diego, California. On the<br>
area map 1614 is superimposed icons designating the locations of six different area<br>
lodgings, e.g., ABC Hotel 1620, DEF Hotel 1622, HIJ Hotel 1624, KLM Hotel 1626,<br>
NOP Hotel 1628, and QRS Hotel 1630. User instructions for interacting with the map are<br>
supplied at reference numerals 1606 and 1608, and the icons on the map may be cleared<br>
or selected using the links provided at reference numbers 1632 and 1634.<br>
Appearing beneath the displayed map 1614 is a pattern key 1638 depicting<br>
five (5) different patterns used to represent five (5) different pricing bands, such as the<br>
previously described Bands I-V in FIGURES 9-10, where the pattern appears in the<br>
background of each icon in the map 1614 to indicate whether the hotel is more ore less<br>
affordable as compared to the other hotels represented by the other displayed icons on the<br>
map. As is shown in the displayed map 1614, the ABC Hotel at 1620 is displayed as an<br>
icon encoded with the pattern assigned to the second to least expensive of the hotels in<br>
Band II, The DEF Hotel at 1622 is displayed as an icon encoded with the pattern<br>
. - assigned to the second .most expensi veof the-hotels. inBand IW The HIJ Hotel at 1624- is — -<br>
displayed as an icon encoded with the pattern assigned to the most expensive of the hotels<br>
in BandV. The KLM Hotel at 1626 is displayed as an icon encoded with the pattern<br>
assigned to the third most expensive of the hotels in Band III. Lastly, the NOP hotel<br>
at 1628 is displayed as an icon encoded with the pattern assigned to the least expensive of<br>
the hotels in Band I. Also appearing near the displayed map 1614 is an availability<br>
key 1642, 1642, depicting blacked out or clear icons to designate those hotels that are not<br>
available as opposed to those that may be available. As is shown in the displayed<br>
map 1614, only one of the hotels, namely the "QRS Hotel" is encoded as unavailable.<br>
In actual use of the rate map interface 1600 appearing in FIGURE 16, the<br>
consumer can easily see that the ABC Hotel is a more affordable hotel than the HIJ Hotel,<br><br>
which is closer to the downtown San Diego area. The consumer can also easily grasp at a<br>
glance, that the more expensive rates occur at hotels located near the downtown San<br>
Diego area.<br>
While the presently preferred embodiments of the invention have been illustrated<br>
and described, it will be appreciated that various changes may be made therein without<br>
departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. For example, although the dynamic<br>
pricing bands have been primarily described and depicted as being keyed to a particular<br>
color or pattern, they could also be keyed to a particular sound, or a combination of<br>
graphical and audio characteristics, including an animated audiovisual characteristic.<br>
While the preferred embodiment of the invention has been illustrated and<br>
described, it will be appreciated that various changes can be made therein without<br>
departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br><br>

Rates for Travel Services<br>
Method and system for presenting rates for travel services is disclosed. One<br>
difficulty in presenting travel service information online has been the inability to provide the<br>
consumer with meaningful comparisons between available travel services (e.g., different<br>
hotels, different flights etc.). To alleviate this issue, a method and system are provided for<br>
presenting rates for travel services using dynamic pricing bands (930A-930E). The dynamic<br>
pricing bands represent approximate rates for travel services relative to available rates during<br>
or close to the proposed dates of travel, or at or near the proposed travel destination. Each<br>
dynamic pricing band is keyed to a particular characteristic (1124, 1638), thereby providing<br>
the consumer a sense of the rate variations due to season, day of week, etc., without having to<br>
compare actual numbers. The dynamic pricing bands are applied to an interactive<br>
presentation of rates for travel services to allow the consumer to explore possible rate<br>
variations for particular travel services in a manner that is intuitive and user-friendly.</td>
