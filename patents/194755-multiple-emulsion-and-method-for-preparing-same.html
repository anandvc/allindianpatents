				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to multiple emulsions and a method for preparing same, especially with respect to multiple emulsions useful as a fuel having desirable characteristics of transportability and combustion.<br>
In the field of emulsions, there are numerous disclosures related to two-phase emulsions, that is water-in-oil (W/O) emulsions and oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions. Multiple emulsions, that is emulsions having more than two phases, are' discussed in connection with various fields in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,478,561, 5,438,041 and 4,254,105, and in connection with fuels in U.S. Patent No. 5,505,877.<br>
The specific composition of emulsions is very important in the fuel industry and numerous characteristics, additives affect the stability of the emulsion, and therefore its usefulness as a fuel having desirable characteristics of transportability and combustion. Further, depending upon the oil or hydrocarbon used in the emulsion, various contaminants may be present, and additives to counteract such contaminants may affect the stability of the emulsion.<br>
The need remains for a stable multiple emulsion which can be formed using reduced amounts of expensive components such as surfactant and other additives.<br>
Furthermore, the need remains for a multiple emulsion wherein the corrosive nature of metals such as vanadium and the like which may typically be contained in the oil phase are<br>
-2-<br><br>
effectively and economically counteracted, without disrupting stability of the emulsion.<br>
In light of the foregoing, it is the primary object of the present invention to provide a stable multiple emulsion which is formed using minimal amounts of surfactant.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide a stable multiple emulsion which includes additives for counteracting the corrosive nature of metals contained in the oil phase.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a multiple emulsion which is readily transportable and combustible as a useful and desirable fuel product.<br>
Other objects and advantages of the present invention will appear hereinbelow.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the foregoing objects and advantages are readily attained.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a multiple emulsion comprising ; a continuous water phase ; an oil droplet phase, such as herein described/ dispersed through the continuous water phase ; an inner water droplet phase dispersed through the oil droplet phase ; a water insoluble compound, such as herein described, suspended in the inner water droplet phase ; and optionally, a surfactant present substantially entirely at an interface between the oil droplet phase and the continuous water phase of the multiple emulsion.<br>
3<br><br>
It would appear clear from the following description and examples that the multiple emulsion according to the instant invention, is not a mere admixture of the components thereof, resulting only in the aggregation of properties of said components.<br>
The present invention also provides a method for forming a multiple emulsion, comprising the steps of : providing a suspension of a water insoluble compound such as herein described in water ; providing an oil phase ; forming a water in oil. emulsion of the suspension in the oil phase ; providing a continuous water phase ; and forming a multiple emulsion of the water in oil emulsion in the continuous water phase in the presence of a surfactant.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
A detailed description of preferred embodiments of the present invention follows, with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein :<br>
Figure 1 schematically illustrates a multiple emulsion in accordance with the present invention ; and<br>
Figure 2 schematically illustrates a method for forming a multiple emulsion in accordance with the present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The invention relates to multiple emulsions, specifically water-in-bitumen-in-water. emulsions which are useful as a transportable and combustible fuel, and to a method for preparing same.<br>
-4-<br><br>
Referring to Figure 1, a schematic illustration of a multiple emulsion system in accordance with the present invention is provided. As shown, emulsion system 10 includes a continuous water phase 12, an oil or hydrocarbon phase dispersed through the continuous water phase, 12 and illustrated in Figure 1 as a single oil droplet 14, and an inner water droplet phase dispersed through the oil droplets 14 as shown in Figure 1 by water droplets 16. In accordance with the present invention, water droplets 16 are a suspension or slurry of water insoluble compound represented by particles 18 which, as will be discussed below, are economically incorporated into the multiple emulsion of the present invention and which advantageously serve to counteract undesirable side effects, during combustion, of, other, materials typically found within the oil phase of the emulsion without adversely affecting stability of the emulsion.<br>
Viscous hydrocarbons can be formed into emulsions such as the emulsion of the present invention so as to provide enhanced transportability and pumpability thereby facilitating use of the viscous hydrocarbon as a combustible fuel. In- preparation of such emulsions, however, surfactants are typically needed so as to provide stability of the emulsion and to prevent rapid aging of same. Furthermore, viscous hydrocarbons may include a number of different components such as metals, particularly vanadium, which are corrosive or cause other complications during combustion of the fuel: In accordance with the present invention, a multiple emulsion as illustrated in Figure 1, and a method for preparation of such an emulsion as illustrated in Figure 2, are provided which advantageously reduce the amount of surfactant needed in formation of the emulsion, and which further allow for reduction of undesirable affects of metals such as<br>
-5-<br><br>
vanadium in an economical manner and without destabilizing the emulsion.<br>
The oil droplet phase of the multiple emulsion of the present invention may suitably be any desired oil or hydrocarbon phase. Viscous hydrocarbons such as herein described however, are particularly well suited to taking advantage of the beneficial characteristics of the present invention. Preferred viscous hydrocarbons include crude oil or bitumens which are characterized by a viscosity of greater than or equal to about 100 cp at 122°F, which have an API gravity of 16 or less, which are characterized by a high metal content, typically at least about 1000 ppm (wt), a high sulfur content and a high asphaltene content, and which typically have a high pour point. A specific example of a suitable viscous hydrocarbon for use in accordance with the present invention is Cerro Negro bitumen. This bitumen contains considerable amounts of vanadium compounds, greater than or equal to about 70,0 ppm (wt), which typically cause corrosion problems and metallic slag formation when burned as a fuel. This type of bitumen is incorporated into an emulsion sold under the trademark Orimulsion(r) by Bitor, S.A. In this two-phase emulsion, magnesium nitrate, a water soluble compound, is added to combat the adverse affects of vanadium. However, magnesium nitrate has been found to promote the growth of bacterias and the like naturally present in the bitumen which in turn have been found to cause destabilization of the emulsion.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, a water insoluble compound, most preferably an insoluble magnesium or calcium compound such as a carbonate, hydroxide, oxide or phosphate of magnesium, calcium or both, are included, in the multiple emulsion<br>
-6-<br><br>
so as to combat the adverse affects of vanadium, but in a form which does not stimulate the growth of bacteria and resulting destabilization of the emulsion.<br>
Magnesium or calcium oxide are particularly preferred as insoluble compositions for addition to the multiple emulsion of the present invention as they are effective in counteracting vanadium, and are also in abundant supply.<br>
The multiple emulsion in accordance with the present invention preferably has an, average droplet size of oil droplets 14 of between 10 microns and 30 microns, and also preferably has an average droplet size of inner water phase droplets 16 of between 2 microns and 6 microns. The water insoluble compound 18 is substantially entirely located within inner water droplets 16.<br>
The multiple emulsion of the present invention preferably has a ratio of bitumen to total water in the emulsion of between 90/10 and 50/50, most preferably about 70/30 vol/vol. Further, water in the inner water droplet phase 16 preferably constitutes less than or equal to about 2% vol. of the total emulsion, while water in the continuous phase 12 preferably constitutes less than or equal to about 28% vol. of the total emulsion.<br>
The multiple-emulsion of the present invention preferably contains water insoluble compound, substantially entirely within the inner water droplet phase, in an amount less than pr equal to about 500 ppm (wt) based upon the total emulsion, and more preferably contains between 100 ppm and 350 ppm (wt). Insoluble<br><br>
compound 18 is preferably, provided having an average particle size of between 0.01 micron and 1 micron.<br>
-7- <br><br>
As will be discussed below, the multiple emulsion of the present invention is preferably formed using a surfactant only during the stage where oil droplets 14 are dispersed through the continuous water phase 12. Thus, the resulting multiple emulsion of the present invention is substantially free of added surfactant in the portion of the emulsion constituting the inner water phase droplets 16 dispersed through oil phase droplets 14, particularly at the interface 15 between the inner water droplet phase and the oil phase, while the added surfactant is present substantially only in the portion in the emulsion constituting the interface 17 between the continuous water phase 12 and oil droplet phase 14.<br>
Referring to Figure 2, the method according to the present invention for forming a multiple emulsion will be described. Initially, a suspension or slurry is provided of the desired water insoluble compound such as described hereinbefore in water. This suspension can be formed through a simple mixing of the water insoluble compound in water in the desired concentration. In this regard, water insoluble compound is preferably mixed with the water so as to form the suspension containing water and insoluble compound in an amount less than or equal to about 12% (wt), preferably between 1% to 9% (wt) based on the suspension.<br>
An oil phase is also provided, preferably a viscous hydrocarbon such as a bitumen, as discussed above. The bitumen is then mixed with the suspension and passed to a mixer 20 where the mixture is subjected to mixing for sufficient time and at a sufficient rate to obtain an emulsion of the suspension in the oil, preferably having a ratio by volume of oil/suspension of between 90/10 and 98/2. The bitumen may be heated before mixing, if<br>
-8-<br><br>
desired, so as to enhance the flowability of same. Heating may or may not be more or less desirable, since heating is necessary only to obtain the required viscosity of the bitumen. The suspension and bitumen may be mixed, for example at a mixing speed in the range of between 1000 rpm and 5000 rpm, and for a time of between 1 minute and 3 minutes so as to provide the suspension in bitumen emulsion preferably having an average water suspension droplet size preferably between 2 microns and 6 microns. The water insoluble compound is substantially entirely within the water suspension phase.<br>
A mixture of water and surfactant/ in proportions such as hereinafter exemplified is then preferably added, to the suspension-in-bitumen emulsion and subjected to sufficient mixing over time so as to provide a multiple emulsion having droplets of the suspension-in-bitumen emulsion dispersed throughout a water continuous phase. This mixing step may suitably be .carried out at a mixer 22 and provides the desired final multiple emulsion preferably having an average droplet size of the suspension-in-bitumen emulsion in the range of between 10 microns and 30 microns. This step is preferably carried out by initially mixing sufficient water and surfactant to provide the multiple emulsion with a ratio of bitumen/water of about 85/15 vol/vol, and then diluting the multiple emulsion to the final desired ratio, for example a ratio of bitumen/water of about 70/30.<br>
The surfactants to be used in the final mixing stage as described above may suitably be selected from the group consisting of non-ionic surfactants such as ethoxylated alkyl phenols, ethoxylated alcohols, nonyl phenol ethoxylates and<br>
-9-<br><br>
ethoxylated sorbitan esters, as well as natural surfactants, mixtures of natural and non-ionic surfactants, and anionic surfactants such as sulfates, sulphonates and carboxylates. Particularly preferred as surfactants for this stage are non-ionic surfactants such as ethoxylated tridecanol, natural surfactants activated by amines such as monoethanolamine, and mixtures of non-ionic surfactants and natural surfactants. In accordance with the invention, the surfactant is preferably provided in amounts by weight of between 500 ppm and 4000 ppm and more preferably between 1000 and 3000 ppm based on the bitumen.<br>
As set forth above, water is preferably used in the method for preparing the multiple emulsion in amounts contained in the suspension and the water/surfactant mixture so as to provide a final ratio by volume in the multiple emulsion of bitumen/water of between 90/10 and 50/50, most preferably about 70/30. Furthermore, water is preferably present in the multiple emulsion in the inner water droplet or suspension phase in an amount of less than or equal to about 2% volume, and in the water continuous phase in an amount of less than or equal to about 28% volume, both with respect to the total emulsion.<br>
The emulsions formed according to the present invention contain suspension-in-bitumen droplets which are big enough to maintain the suspension droplet inside, and which are nevertheless sufficiently small to provide for efficiency in burning.<br>
The multiple emulsion as described above has been found to possess excellent stability and, desirable fluid characteristics in terms of transportability and combustion. Furthermore, the emulsion is formed using relatively small<br>
-10-<br><br><br>
amounts of surfactant, and water insoluble magnesium and calcium compounds in the inner water droplet phase have been found to significantly reduce the adverse affects of vanadium and the like typically found in bitumen, while avoiding the high cost, emulsion instability and other problems associated with the use of water soluble compounds.<br>
The following examples further illustrate the preparation and advantageous characteristics of multiple emulsions in accordance with the present invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
This example demonstrates the stability in terms of droplet diameter (D) and viscosity (at 20 1/s and 100 1/s) of multiple emulsions prepared using varying amounts of magnesium oxide and different types of surfactants*.<br>
A number of multiple emulsions were prepared starting with a suspension of magnesium oxide in water in varying concentrations. 980 grams of Cerro Negro bitumen were heated at 60°C in a suitable container for 1 hour, and 20 ml of the magnesium oxide suspension were added and mixed for 3 minutes at 1400 rpm so as to provide a suspension-in-bitumen emulsion. In the meantime, 0.98 grams of a surfactant were dissolved in 45.88 grams of water, and the surfactant/water mixture was added to the suspension-in-bitumen emulsion and mixed for 3, minutes at 700 rpm to obtain a multiple emulsion having a ratio by volume of bitumen/water of 85/15. To this<br>
11<br><br>
85/15 emulsion, 74.12 additional grams of water were added and mixed at low shear for an additional minute so as to provide the final 70/30 multiple emulsion in accordance with the invention, with about 28% vol. of water in the continuous phase and about 2% vol. of water in the internal water droplet phase.<br>
Several different surfactants were used in this example. Samples were run using a mixture of ethoxylated tridecanol and monoethanolamine for each of 0 ppm, 100 ppm and 350 ppm (wt) of magnesium oxide, and samples were also run using only monoethanolamine as surfactant for each of 0 ppm, 100 ppm and 350 ppm (wt) magnesium oxide.<br>
Storage characteristics for the emulsions prepared using the mixture of ethoxylated tridecanol and monoethanolamine are set forth below in Table l. The viscosities for each measurement in these examples were measured at 30°C using a Haake RV 20 viscosimeter with concentric cylinders of MC-1 type.<br><br><br>

As with Example 1, this example demonstrates that emulsions of the present invention, at varying concentrations of insoluble calcium oxide, and using different types of surfactant, exhibit good stability as indicated by the substantially constant viscosity and droplet size.<br>
Example 3<br>
This example demonstrates preparation and stability of multiple emulsion in accordance with the invention for emulsions prepared having 1% volume of water droplets in the internal suspension-in-bitumen phase, as compared to the 2% volume of water in Examples l and 2. Four sets of emulsions were prepared, two of which were prepared haying 1% and 2% vol. of internal water droplets with magnesium oxide in suspension and using as surfactant an ethoxylated nonyl phenol (Intan 100), and another two which were prepared using 1% and 2% water suspension droplets respectively and, as surfactant, ethoxylated alcohol (Intan 200).<br>
The emulsions having 2% volume of water in the suspension-in-bitumen emulsion were prepared as in Example 1 above. The emulsions prepared having 1% water in the inner water droplet suspension phase were prepared as follows:<br>
990 grams of Cerro Negro bitumen were heated at 60°C in a suitable container for 1 hour. 10 ml of a magnesium oxide<br>
suspension were added to the bitumen and mixed for 3 minutes<br>
16<br><br>
at 1400 rpm. 0.99 grains of a surfactant were dissolved in 49.41 grams of water, and the surfactant/water mixture was added to the suspension-in-bitumen emulsion and mixed with a beater paddle for 3 minutes at 700 rpm so as to provide a suspension-in-bitumen-in-water multiple emulsion having a ratio of bitumen/water of 85/15. To this multiple emulsion, 74.87 grams of additional water were added and mixed at low shear stress for 1 minute so as to provide the desired multiple emulsion having a ratio of bitumen/water of about 70/30.<br>
Table 5 set forth below shows storage characteristics for the 1% and 2% emulsions prepared using ethoxylated nonyl phenol (Intan 100) as surfactant.<br>
