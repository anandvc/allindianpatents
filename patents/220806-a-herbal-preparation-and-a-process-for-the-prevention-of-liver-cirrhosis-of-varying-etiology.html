				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a herbal composition and a process for preparation thereof wherein the herbal composition is useful for prevention and management of liver cirrhosis of varying etiology. The composition of the present invention may also be advantageously used in other liver disorders like amebic hepatitis etc., and thus the further liver damage may be prevented.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Cirrhosis is neither a single process nor a single disease, rather it is the end result of a variety of causes that produce chronic inflammatory change and liver cell injury with eventual distortion of the normal hepatic architecture. Chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis are the two main forms of chronic parenchymal liver disease. They are closely related because some forms of chronic hepatitis progress to cirrhosis.<br>
A variety of cause of chronic parenchynal liver disease are mentioned such as alcohol, hepatitis B virus infection, chronic active hepatitis, immunological factors, metabolic disorders, drugs, cholestasis, prolonged hepatic congestion and malnutrition. Heptic cirrhosis can occur at any age though it manifests itself particularly in younger adults. In life it may be detected incidentally at surgery with minimal features such as hepatomegaly. Frequent complaints include weakness, fatigue, muscle cramps, weight loss and non-specific digestive symptoms such as anorxia, nausea, vomiting upper abdominal discomfort and gaseous abdominal distension. Portal hyperension, ascites, heptic encephalopathy, renal failure, infection, hepatocellular carcinoma are the complications of liver cirrhosis.<br>
A variety of drug therapy is used for the management of liver cirrhosis but these agents itself have health hazards. Thus there is a need for a herbal formulation which is effective in the management of liver cirrhosis without any side effect.<br>
OBJECT OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
An object of this invention is to propose a herbal composition and a process for preparation thereof useful for the prevention of liver cirrhosis among the individuals having one or more than one causative factors for developing liver cirrhosis.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose a herbal composition and process for preparation thereof useful for preventing the liver cirrhosis among the individuals who had suffered from hepatitis B virus infection in past.<br>
Still another object of this invention is to propose a herbal composition and process for preparation thereof useful for preventing the liver cirrhosis among the individuals consuming alcohol.<br>
Further object of the present inventions to propose a herbal composition and process for preparation thereof useful for the prevention of liver cirrhosis among the individuals treated by various chemotherapy for a chronic illness.<br>
Still further object of this invention is to propose a herbal composition and process for preparation thereof useful for the prevention of further inflammatory changes and liver cell injury among the individuals suffering from liver cirrhosis.<br>
t is to be understood that the composition of the present invention is not a mere admixture resulting in aggregation of properties but the different ingredients exhibit synergetic effect on each other as more of individual ingredient is effective for prevention and management of the liver cirrhosis<br>

Various studies have suggested the purgative property of this mixture and further it is reported that the leaves is cathortic and refrigerant and useful in liver and spleen ailments. The plant contains the anti-inflammatory effects.<br>
Phyllanthus urinaria:<br>
This plant is commonly known as "Bhui-amalki" belonging to family "Enphorbiaceae" whose dried leaves and roots are extracted to collect the mixture of flavonoides (quercetin, astragalin, quercitrin, isoquercitrin, rutin) compound. Several studies have shown its hepatoprotective properties. This mixture is successfully used in jaundice, which acts as an appetizer.<br><br>
Andrographis patiiculata:<br>
This plant is commonly known as "Kalmegh" belonging to family "Acanthaceae" whose dried whole plant are extracted to collect the mixture of flavone and glycosides compound. Various studies on this plant has shown anti-inflammatory effects. This plant is useful in torpidity of liver.<br>
The known additives are excipients such as calcium sulphate. Example I:<br>
The preparation containing the organic extract of aloe-vera in the dose of 350 mg administered continuously for three months to the cases showing history of alcoholism, suffered from hepatitis B virus infection, immunological injury, metabolic disorders or taking treatment for some chronic illnesses exhibited mild improvement in the inflammatory changes of the liver observed in USG testing.
