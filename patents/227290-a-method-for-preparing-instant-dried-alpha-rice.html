				<td>"A METHOD FOR PREPARING INSTANT DRIED ALPHA-RICE”<br><br>
The present invention relates to a method for preparing dried alpha-<br>
rice by a vacuum drying process. More particularly, the present invention<br>
relates to a method for preparing dried alpha-rice comprising converting starch<br>
of rice into alpha-form starch and rapidly vacuum drying to fix the alpha-form<br>
starch, thereby conveniently eating at any time and place without having to<br>
perform any cooking operations.<br>
Background Art<br>
Various life styles in modern society lead to changes in dietary<br>
patterns. In particular, as daily schedules become busier and leisure activities<br>
are increasingly pursued, light meals are required. For this reason, instant<br>
foods, e.g., fast food, have been developed.<br>
Cooking of raw rice, which is the staple food for Koreans, has been<br>
prepared by traditional cooking operations for several thousand years. The<br>
traditional cooking operations are mainly performed in the home by washing<br>
rice with water in all seasons, if necessary, soaking the washed rice in water<br>
for a few minutes, and boiling the washed rice using firewood, electricity, gas,<br>
etc., as a heat source. Ready-to-eat rice products consumed during leisure<br>
activities such as mountain climbing, fishing, etc., have been recently<br>
developed. Among these products, retort rice, frozen rice, sterile-wrapped<br>
rice and the like are commercially available. However, these rice products<br>
are troublesome in that additional cooking operations are required to eat them<br>
after opening them.<br>
As cultural life changes, new dietary demands are created. Dried<br>
alpha-rice satisfies the new dietary demands.<br>
The term "dried alpha-rice" as used herein refers to rice in which the<br>
type of starch is converted from beta-form starch (wet starch) to alpha-form<br><br>
starch (modified starch) with unchanged its original crystalline structure.<br>
The beta-starch is not easily digested due to its poor affinity to water<br>
molecules and enzymes in the body, while alpha-starch is easy to digest due to<br>
its susceptibility to enzymatic activities. Generally, rice, potatoes and sweet<br>
potatoes are cooked by adding water the thereto, followed by boiling, in order<br>
to convert wet starch (beta-starch) into modified starch (alpha-starch) and thus<br>
facilitate their digestion in the body.<br>
Various methods for preparing dried rice have been known.<br>
For example, Korean Patent No. 1988-000328, 1994-0002526 and<br>
1994-0000323, etc., propose methods for preparing dried rice. However,<br>
according to these methods, since the dried rice is prepared by hot air-drying,<br>
transformation such as shrinkage takes place. In addition, there are problems<br>
that the restoration to the former state of the dried rice is retarded, and texture<br>
of the dried rice is deteriorated. Korean Patent Application No. 93-17678<br>
discloses an improved method for the preparation of dried rice, compared to<br>
the above-mentioned methods. However, according to the Patent<br>
Application, there may be problems such as reduction in preparation<br>
efficiency, loss of a large amount of nutrients, deterioration in quality due to<br>
propagation of microorganisms and low product quality. These problems are<br>
due to long soaking time.<br>
Therefore, the present invention has been made in view of the above-<br>
mentioned problems, and it is an object of the present invention to provide a<br>
method for preparing instant dried alpha-rice by a vacuum drying process.<br>
According to the method of the present invention, soaking and dehydration<br>
time are optimally controlled to ensure productivity and preparation<br>
efficiency, cooling and washing are carried out twice following hot water<br>
treatment to rapidly fix alpha-starch, and finally vacuum drying is carried out<br>
in a drying chamber at a relatively low temperature to prepare instant dried<br>
alpha-rice, which is restored to its original state and easily digested. The<br>
dried alpha-rice thus prepared is restored in a short time (e.g., 3-10 minutes)<br>
after the addition of hot water. Although cold water is added, the dried<br>
alpha-rice is restored within a predetermined time (11~50 minutes). The<br>
restored alpha-rice has appearance and texture comparable to conventional<br>
boiled rice.<br><br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the above and other objects<br>
can be accomplished by the provision of a method for preparing instant dried<br>
alpha-rice by a vacuum drying process, comprising the steps of:<br>
(a)	washing milled rice with water in a washer to remove impurities<br>
adhered to the shell of the milled rice;<br>
(b)	soaking the washed rice in water for 3~120 minutes to evenly<br>
absorb water, followed by dehydrating in air for 3~30 minutes;<br>
(c)	charging the dehydrated rice into a continuous rice cooker while<br>
maintaining the water temperature at 80~98ºC, followed by hot water treating<br>
for 8~20 minutes to prepare boiled rice;<br>
(d)	quickly cooling the boiled rice using a shower, followed by<br>
washing in a cooling tank; and<br>
(e)	placing the washed boiled rice in a vacuum drying chamber while<br>
maintaining the internal temperature at 60~98 "C, and vacuum drying at an<br>
internal pressure of 1 torr or lower to maintain water content of the boiled rice<br>
at 1~5% or less.<br>
Hereinafter, the method according to the present invention will be<br>
explained in more detail based on the respective steps.<br>
[First step] Washing<br>
Selected raw rice is washed in a washer to completely remove<br>
impurities adhered to the shell of the raw rice. As the raw rice, all kinds of<br>
rice including non-glutinous rice and glutinous rice may be used.<br>
[Second step] Soaking and dehydration<br>
In order to evenly absorb water, soaking is carried out for 3~120<br>
minutes, preferably 10~60 minutes, and more preferably 30 minutes; and then<br>
dehydration is carried out in air for 3~30 minutes, preferably 3~20 minutes,<br>
and more preferably 10 minutes.<br>
The soaking time is appropriately adjusted depending on various<br>
factors such as water temperature and season. When the soaking is not<br>
carried out or is carried out for less than 3 minutes, fissures are formed during<br><br>
hot water treatment, as will hereinafter be described. Since starch and<br>
nutritive ingredients of rice leak through the fissures, the appearance of grains<br>
of the boiled rice is transformed and the boiled rice becomes too soft The<br>
soft boiled rice makes the separation of the grains difficult and deteriorates the<br>
texture of the boiled rice. On the contrary, when the soaking time exceeds<br>
120 minutes, the smell of rice bran is incorporated into the boiled rice, causing<br>
malodor of the boiled rice, and furthermore grains of the boiled rice is<br>
collapsed, deteriorating texture and taste of the rice.<br>
Considering even absorption of water into the soaked rice and<br>
improved productivity, the dehydration time is adjusted within the range of up<br>
to 30 minutes.<br>
[Third step] Hot water treatment<br>
The dehydrated rice is charged into a continuous rice cooker while<br>
maintaining the water temperature at 80~98 ºC, preferably 90~98ºC, and more<br>
preferably 95 TC. Subsequently, hot water treatment is carried out for 8~20<br>
minutes, preferably 8~15 minutes, and more preferably 12 minutes to prepare<br>
boiled rice.<br>
When the water temperature during hot water treatment is within<br>
80~98ºC, the appearance of grains of the boiled rice is maintained to be<br>
constant In addition, since starch is completely converted into alpha-starch,<br>
no deterioration in texture takes place and nutrient losses are minimized.<br>
Furthermore, grains of final alpha-rice to be prepared after vacuum drying,<br>
which will be described below, can be easily separated, and good texture of<br>
the final alpha-rice can be obtained. On the other hand, when the water<br>
temperature exceeds 98 ºC, starch is easily removed but the appearance of<br>
grains of the boiled rice is easily transformed due to excessive hot water.<br>
Accordingly, it is undesirable in terms of texture and dietetics.<br>
[Fourth step] Cooling and washing<br>
First, the boiled rice is subjected to quick cooling using a shower to<br>
fix alpha-form starch, and then washed in a cooling tank to remove starch. The<br>
cooling and washing are repeated twice. Grains of final alpha-rice to be<br>
prepared after vacuum drying, which will be described below, can be easily<br><br>
separated. The water content of the washed boiled rice amounts to 65% or<br>
more, and thus the transformation into beta-starch (aging) is suppressed.<br>
[Fifth step] Vacuum drying<br>
The washed boiled rice is placed in a vacuum drying chamber while<br>
maintaining the internal temperature at 60~98 ºC, and then is subjected to<br>
vacuum drying at an internal pressure of 1 torr or lower to maintain water<br>
content of the boiled rice at 1~5% or less.<br>
The internal temperature of the vacuum drying chamber can be<br>
controlled within the range of 60~98ºC, depending on properties of dried<br>
alpha-rice to be prepared. When drying at a relatively low temperature of<br>
60ºC, heat denaturation of proteins and oxidation of lipids contained in the<br>
dried alpha-rice are inhibited, and thus good color, flavor and taste of the<br>
dried alpha-rice are attained. On the contrary, when drying at a relatively<br>
high temperature of 98 ºC, savory and tasty alpha-rice can be prepared due<br>
to roasting effect<br>
The dried alpha-rice thus prepared has an alpha-starch content of<br>
92% or higher, and maintains its original appearance. The alpha-starch<br>
content influences taste and digestibility of the dried alpha-rice. The<br>
alpha-starch content herein is determined using a diastase digestion method.<br>
The diastase digestion method is commonly used to measure<br>
modification of starch, in a word, hydrolysis of starch by starch hydrolase<br>
(digestibility). Generally, starch products having high alpha-starch content<br>
are susceptible to starch hydrolase, which implies good digestibility in the<br>
body.<br>

was soaked in water for 1 minute and then dehydrated in air for 40 minutes.<br>
The dehydrated rice was hot water treated with water at 75ºC for 7 minutes.<br>
Subsequently, the boiled rice was washed in a cooling tank at 20ºC. The<br>
washed boiled rice was placed in a vacuum drying chamber at an internal<br>
temperature of 90ºC, and then subjected to vacuum drying at an internal<br>
pressure of 1 torr or lower.<br>
Comparative Example 2<br>

was soaked in water for 240 minutes and then dehydrated in air for 30<br>
minutes. The dehydrated rice was hot water treated with water at 100ºC for<br>
20 minutes. Subsequently, the boiled rice was washed in a cooling tank at<br>
20ºC. The washed boiled rice was placed in a vacuum drying chamber at an<br>
internal temperature of 90ºC, and then subjected to vacuum drying at an<br><br>
internal pressure of 1 torr or lower.<br>
Preparing conditions for the respective Examples 1~5 and<br>
Comparative Examples 1~3 are shown in Table 1 below.<br>
Table 1<br><br>
Changes in pH values, solid contents and ingredient contents of the<br>
soaked rice in Examples and Comparative Examples, respectively, were<br>
measured. The change in pH values of soaking solutions was measured by a<br>
pH-meter. The change in solid contents was calculated by subtracting the<br>
weight of dried rice from the weight of raw rice. The weight of the dried rice<br>
was obtained by drying the soaked rice at room temperature for 2 hours,<br>
followed by at 30ºC for 10 hours. The protein, fat and ash contents in the<br>
soaked rice were determined in accordance with the AOAC standard method.<br>
The results are shown in Table 2 below<br><br><br>
As can be seen from Examples and Comparative Examples, pH<br>
values of soaking solutions were decreased as the soaking time increased, and<br>
losses in solid content were increased. The protein contents were<br>
considerably decreased 120 minutes after soaking; the fat contents were<br>
slightly decreased 120 minutes after soaking, but thereafter no changes were<br>
observed; and the ash contents were linearly decreased for 120 minutes after<br>
soaking, and then slowly decreased.<br>
Sensory tests on instant dried alpha-rice prepared in Examples and<br>
Comparative Examples were performed. The results are shown in Tables 3<br>
and 4 below.<br><br>
Table 3<br>
Results of sensory tests on instant dried alpha-rice<br><br><br>
Table 4<br>
Results of sensory tests on instant dried alpha-rice<br><br>
Other physical properties of the dried rice were measured. The<br>
results are shown in Table 5 below.<br><br>
Table 5<br>
Experimental results of instant dried alpha-rice<br><br>
These examples are given for the purpose of illustration and are not to<br>
be construed as limiting the scope of the invention. Accordingly, those<br>
skilled in the art will appreciate that various modifications are possible,<br>
without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention as disclosed in the<br>
accompanying claims.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
In accordance with the method for preparing dried alpha-rice of the<br>
present invention, soaking and dehydration time, and conditions for hot water<br>
treatment and vacuum drying are optimally controlled to ensure preparation<br>
efficiency of the dried alpha-rice. In addition, due to minimized ingredients<br>
losses, nutritional value and quality of product are greatly improved, and a risk<br>
of deterioration in quality is reduced. In particular, short soaking time in the<br>
method for preparing dried alpha-rice makes it possible to maintain the<br><br>
appearance of grains of the boiled rice to be constant and reduce shrinkage of<br>
grains. Furthermore, the method for preparing dried alpha-rice of the present<br>
invention facilitates the separation of grains, reduces fracture of grains, and<br>
imparts porous structures, thereby increasing water absorption rate closely<br>
associated with restoration. Quick cooling and drying in the method for<br>
preparing dried alpha-rice make it possible to increase alpha-starch content<br>
closely associated with digestibility in the body.<br><br>
