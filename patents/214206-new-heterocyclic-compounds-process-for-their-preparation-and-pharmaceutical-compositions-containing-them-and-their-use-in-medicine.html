TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
"NOVEL 4-(HETEROCYCLYL)-BENZENESULFOXIMINE COMPOUNDS AND   PROCEES   OF THEIR   PREPARATION<br>
THEREOF"<br>
We, CADILA HEALTHCARE LIMITED, an Indian Company of Zydus Research Centre, Zydus Tower, Satellite Cross Roads, Gandhinagar-Sarkhej Highway, Ahmedabad-380 015, Gujarat, INDIA.<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is performed:<br><br><br>
_ZRG-MG-004<br>
Feild of Invention<br>
The present invention relates to novel compounds of general formula (I), their analogs, their derivatives their tautomeric forms, their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, pharmaceutical compositions containing them, where G represents substituted or unsubstituted, single or fused groups selcted from aryl group, heteroaryl or heterocyclic groups. Preferably, G represents the groups A, B, C, D, E &amp; F as described below. The present invention also relates to a process of preparing compounds of general formula (I), their analogs, derivatives, their tautomeric forms, their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, pharmaceutical compositions containing them, and novel intermediates involved in their synthesis.<br><br>
The compounds of the present invention are useful in the treatment of inflammatory diseases, preferably, wherein prostaglandins play a pathophysiological role. Their role have been implicated in a number of diseases which includes rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, pyrexia, asthma, bone resorption, cardiovascular diseases, dysmenorrhea, premature labour, nephritis, nephrosis, atherosclerosis, hypotension, shock, pain, cancer, and alzheirner disease.<br>
Background to the invention<br>
Inflammation is a disorder, which is characterized by redness, fever, swelling and pain. Prostaglandins play a major role in the inflammation process and inhibition of prostaglandin production, especially of PGG2, PGH2 and PGE2 has been a common target to treat inflammation. However, NSAIDs that are commonly used to treat prostaglandin-induced pain and inflammation also effect other prostaglandin-regulated processes not associated with<br>

ZRC- MC-004<br>
inflammation process. This leads to severe side effects including life threatening gastric ulcers dyspepsia &amp; nephrotoxicity, thereby reducing their therapeutic use. Previously, NSAIDs have been found to prevent the production of prostaglandins by inhibiting enzymes in the human arachidonic acid/prostaglandih pathway, including the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX). In early 1990s, COX was demonstrated to exist as two distinct isoforms COX-1 and COX-2 (PNAS (1991) 88, 2692-96) and recently a third isoform COX-3 has been discovered from brain (PNAS (2002) 99, 13926-13931). COX-1 &amp; COX-2 serve different physiological and pathophysiological functions. COX-1 is the constitutive isoform &amp; is mainly responsible for the synthesis of cytoprotective prostaglandins in the GI tract and for the synthesis of thromboxane, which triggers platelet aggregation in blood platelets. COX-2 is believed to be an inducible isoform, which is stimulated in response to endotoxins, cytokines, and mitogens. Importantly, COX-2 plays a major role in prostaglandin biosynthesis in inflammatory cells (monocytes/macrophages) and in the central nervous system. (Current Medicinal Chemistry (2000) 7, 1041-62). The use of COX-2 as anti-cancer agents is discussed in Curr Drug Targets 2001 Mar;2 (1):79-106. Hence, the difference in the function of COX-1 &amp; COX-2 provides a goal of separating the toxicity, particularly related to the gastrointestinal tract from efficacy of NSAIDs by developing drugs that are selective COX-2 inhibitors as anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and/or antipyretic agents. It is believed that these compounds would have minimum or no GI &amp; hematologic liabilities from COX-1 inhibition that plague almost all currently marketed NSAIDs, most of which inhibit both COX-1 &amp; COX-2, with specificity for COX-1 inhibition greatly exceeding that for COX-2 inhibition. Celecoxib and Rofecoxib were the first two selective COX-2 inhibitors approved for selected markets for the treatment of certain inflammatory conditions. Although, the concept of selectively inhibiting COX-2 in order to have better efficacy &amp; safety looks quite very attractive, recent clinical studies have raised doubts about the long term efficacy of selective COX-2 inhibitors. Celecoxib was not found to be any better than other NSAIDs in long-term clinical study (BMJ (2002) 324, 1287-88). On the other hand highly selective COX-2 inhibitors produce adverse cardiovascular effects that are not seen in non-selective COX inhibitors (Science (2002) 296, 539-541; JAMA (2001) 268 954-959). The references below disclose anti-inflammatory compounds that are selective COX-2 inhibitors. Increasing number of publications &amp; patents emerging steadily indicates continuing efforts to  find a safe and effective anti-inflammatory agent.  Such novel<br>

In addition to COX, the enzyme lipoxygenase (LOX) also plays an important role in inflammation, 5-LOX products such as LTB4, LTC4 and LTD4 are involved in a variety of pathological processes (Pharmacol Rev (2003), 55 195-227). Therefore, inhibition of 5-LOX activity may produce beneficial effects in inflammation. Studies have indicated that dual inhibitors of COX and LOX may have better safety profile (Pharmacol Res (2001), 43 429-436) than non-selective NSAIDs. The compounds of the present invention are useful in treating inflammatory conditions caused by increased activities of COX and/or LOX enzymes.<br>
Cytokines are known to be involved in inflammatory processes. Tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-a) is described as a key proinflammatory mediator in autoimmune diseases. This 26 kDa enzyme is membrane associated until processed into a smaller (17 kDa) soluble form by TNF-a converting enzyme (TACE). The compounds of the present invention are also useful in the treatment of inflammatory diseases such as arthritis by inhibiting TNF-a, or TACE or by inhibiting the production of Tumor necrosis factor- a.<br><br><br>

Soc. Exp. Biol. Med., 111, 544, (1962); Otterness and Bliven, Laboratory Models for Testing NSAIDS, in Non-Steroidal Anti¬inflammatory Drugs, ( J. Lombardino, ed.1985)). The protocol followed was as described below:<br>
Wistar rats obtained from the Experimental Animal Facility of Zydus Research. Centre. Animals were housed in an environmentally controlled rooms with food and water available ad-libitum. All the experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee. Animals were divided into different groups, each group comprising of five-six animals. After an overnight fast, animals of the control group received vehicle only by oral gavage whereas animals of the other groups received different doses of the test substance(s). Each rat received same volume of the formulation i.e. 2 ml/kg on body weight basis. One hour after administration of the vehicle or test substance, all the animals received sub-planter injection of carrageenan (1 % w/v in saline). Paw volume was measured at 0, 1,3 and 5 hour after carrageenan injection. Anti-inflammatory activity, expressed as % Inhibition in paw<br>
