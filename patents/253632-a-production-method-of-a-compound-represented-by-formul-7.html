				<td>The present invention relates to a production method of a compound represented by formula (7).<br>
Technical Field [0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a method for selectively demethylating a methoxy group present at the ortho position (2-position) of an aromatic carboxylic acid, and a method for producing an aminothia2ole derivative via the demethylation method.<br>
Background Art [0002]<br>
It is known that compounds in which 2-hydroxybenzoic acids are amide-bonded to 2-aminothiazoles have an excellent gastroprokinetic effect and are useful as prophylactic and therapeutic agents for epigastric indefinite complaints, nausea, vomiting, heartburn, anorexia, abdominal bloating , gastro-oesophageal reflux , and the like (patent documents 1 to 3) . Among these compounds, the compound represented by formula (7a) below: <br>
[0003]<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
,(Figure Removed)  particularly, has a high safety as well as an excellent<br>
enterokinesis-improving effect and is useful as a<br>
prophylactic and therapeutic agent for the above-described<br>
various enterokinetic disorders.<br>
[0005]<br>
As a method for producing these 2-hydroxybenzoic acid<br>
amide derivatives, patent document 1 adopts a method which<br>
involves reacting a 2-methoxybenzoic acid amide derivative<br>
with a demethylating reagent such as pyridine hydrochloride<br>
to make a 2-hydroxybenzoic acid derivative. However, the<br>
demethoxylation reaction has been problematic to adopt<br>
industrially because the reaction produces many side<br>
reactions, making it difficult to selectively demethylate<br>
only a methoxy group selectively at the 2-position of the<br>
amide derivative.<br>
[0006]<br>
On the other hand, patent documents 2 and 3 describe<br>
that the reaction of 2-methoxybenzoic acid amide derivatives<br>
with amines such as secondary and tertiary amines selectively<br>
demethylates methoxy groups selectively at the 2-position<br>
thereof. However, the yield of the demethylation reaction<br>
of methoxy groups at the 2-position of the compounds is on<br>
the order of 64 . 6 to 86% and has not yet reached a satisfactory<br>
level in view of an industrial method.<br>

[Patent document' 2]: W098/58918<br>
 [Patent document 3]: Japanese Patent Laid-Open No.<br>

Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Problems to be Solved by the Invention<br>
[0007]<br>
An object of the present invention is to find a method<br>
for selectively demethylating the 2-methoxy group of an<br>
aromatic carboxylic acid and provide an industrial method<br>
for producing an aminothiazole derivative useful as a medicine<br>
via the demethylation method.<br>
Means for Solving the Problems<br>
[0008]<br>
Accordingly, as a result of various studies of a method<br>
for selectively demethylating the 2-methoxy group of an<br>
aromatic carboxylic acid having the methoxy group at the<br>
2-position thereof, the present inventor has found that the<br>
combination of a particular Lewis acid and a particular solvent<br>
enables the selective demethylation of only the 2-methoxy<br>
group of the aromatic carboxylic acid even when methoxy.groups<br>
are present in the 3-, 4-, and 5-positions thereof. The<br>
present inventor has further found that when the amidation<br>
reaction of a 2-hydroxy aromatic carboxylic acid with a<br>
2-aminothiazole is carried out, the use of the means involving<br>
reacting a phenyl ester of the 2-hydroxy aromatic carboxylic<br>
_ 4 -<br>
acid with the 2-aminothiazole allows the reaction to proceed<br>
with an extremely high yield.<br>
 (wherein ring A represents a benzene ring or a 6-membered<br>
aromatic heterocycle; R1 represents a hydrogen atom, a lower<br>
alkyl group, a halogen atom, a nitro group, an amino group,<br>
a mono-lower alkylamino group, or a di-lower alkylamino group;<br>
at least one of R2, R3, and R4 represents a lower alkoxy group,<br>
- 5 -<br>
a lower alkoxylmethoxy group, an aralkoxy group, or an<br>
aralkoxylmethoxy group, preferably a methoxy group, and the<br>
rest each represents a hydrogen atom, a lower alkyl group,<br>
a halogen atom, a nitro group, an amino group, a mono-lower<br>
alkylamino group, or adi-lower alkylaminogroup; R5represents<br>
a hydrogen atom or an electron-withdrawing group; and R6<br>
represents an alkyl group.)<br>
[0012]<br>
Thus, the present invention provides a production method<br>
of a compound of formula (2) , comprising reacting a compound<br>
of formula (1) with a Lewis acid selected from the group<br>
consisting of BFa, licit, and AlCla in esteric, ketonic or<br>
amidic solvents, with the proviso that an alkali metal bromide<br>
or an alkali metal iodide coexists in the case of BF3.<br>
The present invention also provides a production method<br>
of a compound of formula (3) , comprising reacting a compound<br>
of formula (2) with a phenol derivative or a triphenyl phosphite<br>
derivative.<br>
In addition, the present invention provides a production<br>
method of a compound of formula (5), comprising reacting a<br>
compound of formula (3) with a compound of formula (4) under<br>
heating at 150°C or higher or in the presence of a boric acid<br>
ester.<br>
Further, the present invention provides a production<br>
method of a compound represented by formula (7) , comprising<br>
reacting a compound represented by formula (5) with<br>
N,N-diisopropylethylenediamine in the presence of toluene.<br>
[0013]<br>
- ID -<br>
In the above reaction formula showing the method of the<br>
present invention, a compound represented by formula (3) is<br>
a novel compound, and the compound is extremely important<br>
as an intermediate in the method of the invention.<br>
[0014]<br>
In addition, of the compounds represented by formula<br>
(5) , a compound wherein R6 is a methyl group, represented by<br>
formula (5a):<br>
[0015]<br>
COOCH3<br>
(5a)<br>
[0016]<br>
(wherein ring A and R1, R2, R3, and R4 are the same as defined<br>
above)<br>
is a novel compound, and the compound is also useful as an<br>
intermediate in the method of the invention.<br>
[0017]<br>
It has been also found that the compound represented<br>
(Figure Removed)is converted to the hydrochloride thereof, followed by<br>
recrystallization from an isopropanol aqueous solution to<br>
provide the compound represented by formula (7c):<br>
[<br>
According to the present invention, a phenyl ester<br>
representedby formula (3) is used as an intermediate to provide<br>
a compound represented by formula (7) useful as an<br>
enterokinesis-improving agent at a high yield and a high<br>
purity.<br>
Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
[0023]<br>
In the above reaction formula, ring A represents a benzene<br>
ring or a 6-membered aromatic heterocycle. The 6-membered<br>
aromatic heterocycle is preferably one containing one or two<br>
selected from a nitrogen atom, an oxygen atom, and a sulfur<br>
atom, and specific examples thereof include a pyridine ring,<br>
a pyrimidine ring, a pyrazine ring, a oxazoline ring, and<br>
a thiazoline ring; a pyridine ring is preferable. Because<br>
these heterocycles have a methoxy group at the ortho position<br>
relative to the carboxyl group, for example, as in the formula<br>
(1), the ortho position relative to the carboxyl group or<br>
carbonyl group comprises a carbon atom. Thus, when the<br>
position of the carboxyl group or carbonyl group is defined<br>
as the 1-position, specific examples of the heterocycle<br>
include a 3-pyridyl group, a 4-pyridyl group, a 5-pyridyl<br>
group, a 6-pyridyl group, a 3,5-pyrimidinyl group, and a<br>
4, 6-pyrimidinyl group . Among these groups, a 3-pyridyl group,<br>
a 4-pyridyl group, a 5-pyridyl group, and a 6-pyridyl group<br>
are preferable. Ring A is particularly preferably a benzene<br>
ring.<br>
[0024]<br>
At least one of R2, R3, and R4 is a lower alkoxy group,<br>
a lower alkoxylmethoxy group, an aralkoxy group, or an<br>
aralkoxylmethoxy group (preferably a methoxy group).<br>
According to the present invention, even when one to three<br>
of R2, R3, and R4 are each a lower alkoxy group, a lower<br>
alkoxylmethoxy group, an aralkoxy group, or an<br>
aralkoxylmethoxy group (preferably a methoxy group), only<br>
the methoxy group at the 2-position relative to the carboxyl<br>
group is selectively demethylated.<br>
[0025]<br>
Examples of the lower alkoxy groups represented by R2,<br>
R3, and R4 include a methoxy group, an ethoxy group, and a<br>
methylenedioxy group, and examples of the lower<br>
alkoxylmethoxy groups include a methoxylmethoxy group and<br>
an ethoxylmethoxy group. Examples of the aralkoxy groups<br>
include a benzyloxy group, a methoxybenzyloxy group, and a<br>
trityloxy group, and examples of the aralkoxylmethoxy groups<br>
include a benzyloxylmethoxy group and a<br>
methoxybenzyloxylmethoxy group.<br>
[0026]<br>
Examples of the lower alkyl groups represented by R1 to<br>
R4 include Ci_e alkyl groups such as, for example, a methyl<br>
group, an ethyl group, an isopropyl group, and an n-butyl<br>
group. Examples of the halogen atom include a chlorine atom,<br>
a fluorine atom, a bromine atom, and an iodine atom; among<br>
these atoms, a chlorine atom, a fluorine atom, and a bromine<br>
atom are preferable. Examples of the mono-lower alkylamino<br>
group includemono-Ci-6 alkyl amino groups such as, for example,<br>
a methylamino group, an ethylamino group, and an<br>
isopropylamino group. Examples of the di-lower alkylamino<br>
group include di-Ci_6 alkylamino groups such as, for example,<br>
a dimethylamino group, a diethylamino group, and a<br>
diisopropylamino group.<br>
[0027]<br>
R1 to R4 are preferable when R1 is a hydrogen atom; at<br>
least one of R2 to R4 is a lower alkoxy group; and the rest<br>
of R2 to R4 are each a lower alkoxy group, a lower alkyl group,<br>
a halogen atom, a nitro group, an amino group, a mono-lower<br>
alkylamino group, or a di-lower alkylamino group. R1 to R4<br>
are more preferable when R1 and R4 are each a hydrogen atom;<br>
R2 and R3 are each a lower alkoxy group, a lower alkyl group,<br>
a halogen atom, a nitro group, an amino group, a mono-lower<br>
alkylamino group, or a di-lower alkylamino group. R1 to R4<br>
are still more preferable when R1 and R4 are each a hydrogen<br>
atom; R2 and R3 are each a lower alkoxy group, and particularly<br>
when R1 and R4 are each a hydrogen atom; R2 and R3 are each<br>
a methoxy group.<br>
[0028]<br>
Examples of the electron-withdrawing group represented<br>
by R5 include halogen atoms (for example, a fluorine atom),<br>
a nitro group, a trifluoromethyl group, a trichloromethyl<br>
group, a cyano group, an acetyl group, a sulfonic acid group,<br>
and alkylsulfonic acid groups. Among these groups, a nitro<br>
group is particularly preferable.<br>
[0029]<br>
Examples of the alkyl group represented by R6 include<br>
Ci-e alkyl groups such as, for example, a methyl group, an<br>
ethyl group, a propyl group, an isopropyl group, an n-butyl<br>
group, a tert-butyl group, and a 2-ethylhexyl group.<br>
[0030]<br>
Each of the reaction processes is described below.<br>
A compound of formula (1) is reacted with a Lewis acid<br>
selected from BF3, TiCl4, and AlCls in esteric, ketonic or<br>
amidic solvents, with the proviso that an alkali metal bromide<br>
or an alkali metal iodide coexists in the case of BF3, to<br>
selectively demethylate only the methoxy group at the<br>
2-position to provide a compound of formula (2) at a high<br>
yield.<br>
[0031]<br>
BF3, TiCl4, and A1C13 may be in the form of a solvate<br>
or a hydrate; and BF3-Et20, TiCl4, A1C13, and A1C13-6H20 are<br>
preferably used. These Lewis acids are each preferably used<br>
in an amount of 1.1- to 4-fold moles, particularly 1.1- to<br>
3-fold moles based on a compound of formula (1) in view of<br>
a good balance between reaction selectivity and efficiency.<br>
When BF3 is used, NaBr, Nal, KBr, KI, or the like coexists<br>
therewith for the proceeding of the selective demethylation<br>
reaction of the methoxy group at the 2-position. Lewis acids<br>
other than these Lewis acids, such as, for example, Sn, Mg<br>
and Zn Lewis acids and Ti (OiPr) 4 do not cause the demethylation<br>
reaction. The above-described alkali metal salt is<br>
preferably used in an amount equimolar to that of the Lewis<br>
acid.<br>
[0032]<br>
The reaction solvent is esteric, ketonic, or amidic<br>
solvents. The use of a hydrocarbonic solvent such as toluene<br>
does not selectively provide a compound of formula (2) because<br>
it also demethylates a methoxy group other than the methoxy<br>
group at the 2-position. Examples of the esteric solvent<br>
include ethyl acetate, methyl acetate, butyl acetate, and<br>
isobutyl acetate; ethyl acetate is preferable. Examples of<br>
the ketonic solvent include acetone, 2-butane, cyclohexane,<br>
and cyclopentane. Examples of the amidic solvent include<br>
dimethylformamide and dimethylacetamide; dimethylformamide<br>
ispref erable. In this respect, inaddition to these solvents,<br>
other toluenic solvents may be also used.<br>
[0033]<br>
The reaction is preferably carried out at 50 to 150°C<br>
for 0. 5 to 5 hours, particularly at 60 to 80°C for 1 to 3 hours.<br>
[0034]<br>
According to the present invention, only the methoxy<br>
group at the 2-position is selectively demethylated to provide<br>
a compound of formula (2) at a high yield of 90% or more.<br>
[0035]<br>
A compound of formula (2) is reacted with a phenol<br>
derivative or a triphenyl phosphite derivative to provide<br>
a compound of formula (3) . When the phenol derivative is used<br>
as a phenylation agent, the reaction is preferably performed<br>
in the presence of thionyl chloride, phosphorus oxychloride,<br>
or the like. When the triphenyl phosphite derivative is used<br>
as a phenylation agent, the reaction is preferably conducted<br>
in the presence of sulfuric acid, methansulfonic acid,<br>
toluenesulfonic acid, trifluoromethanesulfonic acid, or the<br>
like. Examples of the phenol derivative include phenol and<br>
para-nitrophenol. Examples of the triphenyl phosphite<br>
derivative include triphenyl phosphite and<br>
tri-para-nitrophenyl phosphite; triphenyl phosphite is<br>
preferable.<br>
[0036]<br>
The phenylation reaction is preferably carried out in<br>
a hydrocarbonic solvent such as toluene, xylene, and tetralin<br>
at room temperature to 150°C for 1 to 24 hours, particularly<br>
at 90 to 120°C for 2 to 5 hours.<br>
[0037]<br>
A compound of formula (3) is reacted with a compound<br>
of formula (4) under heatingat 150°Cor higher or in thepresence<br>
of a boric acid ester to provide a compound of formula (5)<br>
at an extremely high yield.<br>
[0038]<br>
When a compound of formula (3) is reacted with a compound<br>
of formula (4) under heating at 150°C or higher, the solvent<br>
is preferably tetralin, xylene, dimethylformamide,<br>
dimethylacetamide, or dimethylsulfoxide. A reaction<br>
temperature of lower than 150°C prolongs the reaction time.<br>
Preferred reaction temperature is 150°C or higher,<br>
particularly 150 to 180°C. The reaction terminates in 2 to<br>
5 hours. This method allows a compound of formula (4) with<br>
a high purity to be obtained at a high yield because it does<br>
not cause side reactions despite the high reaction<br>
temperature.<br>
[0039]<br>
The boric acid ester is preferably triphenyl borate.<br>
The use of triphenyl borate allows a compound of formula (4)<br>
with a high purity to be obtained at a high yield because<br>
it causes little side reactions. The reaction solvent is<br>
preferably toluene or xylene. The reaction is preferably<br>
conducted at 80 to 120°C, and terminates in 1 to 5 hours under<br>
this condition.<br>
[0040]<br>
A compound of formula (5) is reacted with<br>
N, N-diisopropylethylenediamine (6) in thepresence of toluene<br>
to provide a compound of formula (7).<br>
 [0041]<br>
This reaction is carried out in toluene to cause little<br>
coloration of the reaction solution. As a result, a compound<br>
of formula (7) obtained does not become colored, simplifying<br>
the after-treatment thereof. The use of xylene or tetralin<br>
as a solvent tends to allow the reaction solution to become<br>
brownish yellow. This reaction is preferably performed at<br>
50 to 150°C for 1 to 24 hours, particularly at 90 to 120°C<br>
for 5 to 10 hours.<br>
[0042]<br>
A production method of the compound of formula (7c) from<br>
the compound of formula (7a) is then described. The compound<br>
of formula (7a) can be present in the form of various acid<br>
addition salts; however, the hydrochloride thereof is<br>
preferable. The hydrochloride is present in the form of an<br>
anhydride, a monohydrate, and a trihydrate; among these, the<br>
trihydrate thereof is excellent particularly in storage<br>
stability. The compound of formula (7a) is recrystallized<br>
from an isopropanol aqueous solution to provide the trihydrate<br>
thereof (7c) stably and efficiently. The isopropanol aqueous<br>
solution used preferably has a concentration of 10 to 90%.<br>
The compound of formula (7c) obtained using the isopropanol<br>
aqueous solution is stable to temperature changes, handling<br>
at room temperature, and formulation, and useful as a<br>
pharmaceutical raw material.<br>
Examples<br>
[0043]<br>
Then, the present invention is described in further<br>
detail with reference to Examples. However, the present<br>
invention is not intended to be limited thereto.<br>
[0044]<br>
Example 1<br>
Synthesis of 2-hydroxy-4,5-dimethoxybenzoic acid (2a)<br>
(1) In 10 g of ethyl acetate were suspended 2.0 g of<br>
2,4,5-trimethoxybenzoic acid (la) and 1.45 g of NaBr in a<br>
stream of argon, to which 4.0 g of BF3-Et20 was then added<br>
dropwise at 25°C, followedby heat stirring at 40°C for 3 hours .<br>
The reaction liquid was cooled with ice, to which 10 mL of<br>
water was then added dropwise at 10°C, followed by dropwise<br>
adding 7 . 5 g of a 25% (w/w) sodium hydroxide aqueous solution.<br>
Thereto was further added 10 mL of water before stirring,<br>
followed by filtering off insoluble inorganic matter. To the<br>

was then added dropwise at 10 to 15°C under cooling with ice.<br>
The reaction liquid was heated to reflux, and stirred for<br>
5 hours. This reaction liquid was cooled, to which 4.9 g of<br>
35% hydrochloric acid was then added dropwise at 24°C before<br>
adding 30 mL of water, followed by heat stirring at 55°C for<br>
one hour. The precipitated crystal was collected by<br>
filtration and washed with water to provide 12 . 45 g of compound<br>
(2a) in the form of a wet crystal. The moiety (6.23 g) of<br>
the resultant wet crystal was suspended in 15 mL of water,<br>
to which 3 . 52 g of a 25% (w/w) sodium hydroxide aqueous solution<br>
was then added dropwise at 18°C, followed by heat stirring<br>
at 60°C for one hour. To the reaction liquid was added 20<br>
mL of ethyl acetate, which was then subjected to<br>
liquid-separating operation, followedby dropwise adding 2 .19<br>
g of 35% hydrochloric acid to the separated aqueous layer.<br>
The precipitated crystal was collected by filtration and<br>
washed with water. The resultant crystal was dried under<br>
reduced pressure at 60°C to provide 4.13 g of compound (2a)<br>
at a yield of 88%.<br>
[0046]<br>
(3) In 11 mL of dimethylformamide (DMF) were suspended<br>
2.12 g of compound (la), 4.82 g of A1C13-6H20, and 2.06 g of<br>
NaBr in a stream of argon, which was then heat stirred at<br>
100°C for 5 hours. The reaction liquid was allowed to stand<br>
to cool, to which 10.4 g of 35% hydrochloric acid was then<br>
added dropwise before adding 11 mL of water, followed by heat<br>
stirring at 70°C for one. hour. The precipitated crystal was<br>
collected by filtration and washed with water. The resultant<br>
crystal was dried under reduced pressure at 60°C to provide<br>
1.45 g of compound (2a) at a yield of 73%.<br>
 [0047]<br>
(4) In 20 g of toluene was suspended 6.28 g of<br>
in a stream of argon, to which 20 g of DMF was then added<br>
dropwise at 26°Cbefore adding 10. 0 g of compound (la) , followed<br>
by heat stirring at 85°C for 1.5 hours. The reaction liquid<br>
was cooled, to which 5.89 g of 35% hydrochloric acid was then<br>
added dropwise before adding 17.0 g of water, followed by<br>
heat stirring at 75°C for one hour. The precipitated crystal<br>
was collected by filtration and washed with water. The<br>
resultant crystal was dried under reduced pressure at 60°C<br>
to provide 9.0 g of compound (2a) at a yield of 96%.<br>
[0048]<br>
Comparative Example 1<br>
(1) To 1 mL of ethyl acetate were added 200 mg of compound<br>
(la) and 387 (J.L of BF3-Et20 in a stream of argon, which was<br>
then stirred at 25°C for 5 hours. However, the reaction did<br>
not proceed under these conditions. The reaction also did<br>
not proceed at all even under conditions of 50°C for 5 hours<br>
using acetonitrile as a solvent. Thus, it has been found that<br>
the use of BF3-Et20 requires a reagent such as NaBr.<br>
[0049]<br>
(2) In 5. 0 g of toluene was suspended 500 mg of compound<br>
(la) in a stream of argon, to which 1.27 g of TiCl4 was then<br>
added dropwise at 22°C. The reaction liquid was heat stirred<br>
at 70 to 75°C for one hour.<br>
This reaction also demethylates methoxy groups other<br>
than the methoxy group at the 2-position, not enabling the<br>
desired compound to be selectively obtained.<br>
 [0050]<br>
(3) In 10 mL of toluene was suspended 500 mg of<br>
2, 4, 5-trimethoxybenzoic acid in a stream of argon, to which<br>
1. 26gof AlClswas then added under stir ring at r oom temper a t ur e ,<br>
The reaction liquid was heat stirred at 90 to 98°C for 2 hours.<br>
This reaction also demethylates methoxy groups other<br>
than the methoxy group at the 2-position, not enabling the<br>
desired compound to be selectively obtained.<br>
From the above (2) and (3), it has been found that the<br>
combination of BF3-Et20, TiCl4, or AlCls and an esteric, ketonic<br>
or amidic solvent is important for selectively demethylating<br>
the methoxy group at the 2-position.<br>
