				<td>Field of the invention<br>
This invention relates to polymerizable monomers containing N-Acetyl Glucosamine (NAG) of formula (1) herein below<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
wherein, R is H, CH3, C2H5 or C6H5, X is based on 4-Amino Butyric Acid(4-ABA), 6-Amino Caproic Acid(6-ACA), 8 Amino Octanoic Acid(8-AOA),IO-Amino Decanoic Acid(IO-ADA), II-Amino Undecanoic Acid(lI-ADA); Y is selected from the group consisting of N-Acetyl Glucosamine, mannose, galactose and sialic acid, fructose, ribulose, erythrolose, xylulose, psicose, sorbose, tagatose, glucopyranose, fructofuninose, deoxyribose, galactosamine, sucrose, lactose, isomaltose, maltose, cellobiose, cellulose and amylose.<br>
More particularly the present invention relates to the said monomers containing carbohydrate ligands and preparation thereof through the specific linkage mentioned herein. Still more particularly it relates to monomers which bind more strongly to lysozyme than N-Acetyl Glucosamine itself. The monomers provided are prepared by reacting acryloyl chloride of formula 2 (wherein R= H for Acryloyl and R= CH3 in case Methacryloyl Chloride) herein below with a ligand such as N -Acetyl Glucosamine of formula 3 exemplified hereinbelow or mannose, galactose and sialic acid.<br>
(Formula Removed) <br><br>
The effect of grafting variables such as time, temperature, monomer concentration and initiator onto chitin was studied. Dimick et al. (J.Am.,Chem. Society, 121, 44,10286-10296,1999) reported the molecular cluster glycoside effects and the synthesis of polyvalent ligands for the plant lectin concanavalin A. Krepinsky, et al. (United States Patent 6,184,368, 2001) reported the limitations in the productive binding of chitosan to lysozyme and methods for the synthesis of polyvalent carbohydrate molecules by glycosylation of partially protected polysaccharides bearing a single glycosylating agent or a mixture of glycosylating agents.<br>
Chitosan (Formula 4) is a linear, binary heteropolysaccharide and consists of 2-acetoamido-2-deoxy- ß- D-glucose( GlcNAc;A -unit) and 2-amino- 2-deoxy -ß- D glucose (GlcNAc, D-unit). The active site of lysozyme comprises subsites designated A-F. Specific binding of chitosan sequences to lysozyme begins with binding of the NAG units in the subsite C. Moreover natural ligands derived from glucose are susceptible to microbial growth. Hence there is a need to synthesize ligands similar to repeat units of chitosan which will not be hydrolyzed by lysozyme. These polymers are expected to be more stable than chitin and chitosan reported earlier.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
Apart from the type of the ligand, its distribution along the polymer chain also plays a<br>
crucial role in influencing the efficiency of the inhibition. Controlled synthesis of amphiphilic<br>
block copolymers bearing pendent N-Acetyl-D-Glucosamine residues by living cationic po<br>
merization and the interaction of the resulting diblock copolymers with lectins was reported<br>
by Yamada et al.(Macromolecules, 32,3553-3558,1999) This methodology of synthesizing<br>
homopolymers and the block copolymers containing N-Acetyl-D-Glucosamine residues<br>
demonstrates significant increase in binding affinity for lectin. Applicability of the method is<br>
however limited by need for very low temperature and stringent polymerization conditions.<br>
Objects of the invention<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide polymerizable monomers for applications in medicine and biotechnology.<br>
Another object is to provide a convenient method of preparation of reactive polymers of various molecular weights with the ligands like NAG, mannose, galactose or sialic acid, fructose, ribulose, erythro lose, xylulose, psicose,sorbose,   tagatose,    glucopyranose,<br><br>
fructofuranose, deoxyribose, galactosamine, sucrose, lactose, isomaltose, maltose, cellabiose, cellulose and amylose.<br>
Still another object is to provide a convenient method of preparation of monomers,<br>
containing a ligand.<br>
Yet another object is to provide a method of preparation of monomers containing NAG for enhanced interactions.<br>
Still another object is to provide more stable ligands for the interactions with biomolecules than the natural polymers such as chitin and chitosan containing NAG. Summary of the invention<br>
The present invention provides polymerizable monomers for a biomolecular target and method for synthesis thereof, which exhibits selective binding to the target enzyme/ protein. The present invention also provides a method for obtaining affinity ligand useful for isolating target biomolecule from a solution. The polymerizable ligands may be further oligomerized or polymerized and may posses a terminal functional group. Further, these can be copolymerized with other comonomers to offer copolymers bearing a wide range of polymer architecture than those realized in the past. These ligands containing N-Acetyl Glucosamine are easy to prepare and are resistant to degradation are reusable, stable and free from microbial contamination. Accordingly the present invention provides a polymerizable monomer of formula 1<br>

In one of the embodiments of the present invention the polymerizable monomeric acid<br>
chloride is selected from methacryloyl or acryloyl chloride.<br>
In another embodiment the alkali may be 10 to 20% solution of hydroxide, bicarbonate<br>
or carbonate of alkali metal exemplified by NaOH, KOH, NaHCOs, NaiCOs.<br>
In another embodiment the spacer includes bifunctional compounds having a reactive<br>
site for bonding with the monomeric acid chloride and a reactive site for bonding with<br>
carbohydrate ligand, functional groups exemplified by OH, COOH or NFb such as 4-Amino<br>
Butyric (4-ABA)Acid ,6-Amino Caproic Acid (6-ACA), 10-Amino Decanoic Acid (10-<br>
ADA), 1, 4-diaminobutane, hexamethylenediamine, 1,4-butanediol.<br>
In still another embodiment the solvent used for solvent extraction of unreacted<br>
monomeric spacer is non solvent to the monomeric spacer exemplified by ethyl or methyl<br>
acetate.<br>
In yet another embodiment the acidification is carried out using mineral acids having<br>
concentration of 5 to 20%<br>
In still another embodiment the organic solvent used to dissolve the conjugate is<br>
selected from dimethyl formamide, tetra hydro furan or di-methyl sulfoxide.<br>
In yet another embodiment the carbohydrate ligand is selected from NAG, sialic acid,<br>
mannose or galactose.<br>
In still another embodiment the coupling agent used is selected from compounds such<br>
as Dicyclohexyl Carbodiimide (DCC), I-Cyclohexyl 3-(2- Morpholinoethyl) Carbodiimide<br>
metho-p-toluenesulfonate(CMC), and I-Ethyl-3-(3-Dimethylamino-propyl)<br>

In yet another embodiment the molar ratios of polymerizable monomeric acid<br>

preferably from 0.8: 1 to 1: 0.8.<br>
In a feature of the present invention the conjugation of the monomer with the ligand is<br>
effected through a spacer. The "spacer "provides greater accessibility to the ligand conjugate<br>
for binding with receptor biomolecule.<br>
In yet another feature the polymerizable acid chloride is linked to NAG through CH20H group, a feature not present in chitosan, chitin and/or other derivatives of NAG so far reported in the literature. Detailed description of the invention<br>
Site-specific interactions in general and protein-carbohydrate interactions in particular are key to enhanced binding. The monovalent interactions are weak whereas multivalent interactions can lead to effective inhibition even at very low concentration. The present invention relates to the polymerizable monomers containing NAG which can be converted to homo and copolymers for applications in medicine and biotechnology. A further aspect of the invention is to prepare monomeric NAG comprising a spacer arm. The advantage of incorporating spacer arms is enhanced accessibility of the ligand to active site of the enzyme.<br>
The term "monomer" means any polymerizable organic compound, which is capable of forming covalent linkages i.e., polymerization under the appropriate conditions can be used such as acrylic or methacrylic acid, acryloyl or methacryloyl chloride, glycidyl acrylate or methacrylate, glycerol acrylate or methacrylate, allyl chloride; hydroxy-lower-alky-1- acrylates, such as 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate or 3-hydroxypropyl methacrylate, and amino-lower-alkyl acrylates, such as 2-amino-ethyl methacrylate. Monomers, which are soluble in water or water/polar organic solvent mixtures, are particularly preferred.<br>
A representative ligand used here is Methacryloyl N-Acetyl Glucosamine of formula 5 as shown herein below but does not limit the scope of invention.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
NAG is derived from chitosan which is a linear, binary heteropolysaccharide and consists 2 -acetoamido-2-deoxy-ß-D-glucose (GlcNAc ; A-unit) and 2-amino 2-deoxy-ß-D-glucose (GlcNAc, D-unit). Chitosan is a powerful natural ligand, which binds to lysozyme<br><br>
through the NAG residues. But it suffers from three major limitations 1) Chitosan is insoluble at neutral pH, which limits many applications. 2) Chitosan undergoes the transglycosylation and mutarotation, which substantially reduces its activity and efficiency 3) Chitosan is hydrolyzed by lysozyme.<br>
The present invention also provides a simple and novel process for the preparation of polymerizable monomers comprising NAG, which can be exploited for the multivalent interactions. The merits of the approach have been highlighted using NAG as an illustration.<br>
Various methods have been reported in the past for the synthesis of glycoconjugate oligomers and clusters for the receptor binding activity. Nishimora et al. (Macromolecules., 27, 4876-4880, 1994) synthesized clustering sugar homopolymers from acrylamidoalkyl glycosides of N-Acetyl-D-Glucosamine. On addition of the cluster type polymer, binding to WGA was enhanced.<br>
The methodology described by us is useful to synthesize the polyvalent carbohydrate conjugates to enhance ligand substrate interactions. Further the approach can be extended to other ligands such as sialic acid, mannose and galactose.<br>
The present invention provides polymerizable monomers having formulae (1)<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
wherein, R is H, CH3, C2H5, C6H5; X is a based on spacer exemplified by 4-Amino Butyric Acid(4-ABA), 6-Amino Caproic Acid(6-ACA), 8-Amino Octanoic Acid(8-AOA), lO-Amino Decanoic Acid(lO-ADA), 11-Amino Undecanoic Acid(l 1-ADA); Y is a carbohydrate ligand such as N-Acetyl Glucosamine ,mannose, galactose and sialicacid, fructose, ribulose, erythrolose, xylulose, psicose, sorbose, tagatose, glucopyranose, fructofuranose, deoxyribose,<br>
galactosamine, sucrose, lactose, isomaltose, maltose, cellobiose, cellulose and amylose.<br>
The present invention also provides a process for the preparation of the polymerizable<br>
monomers mentioned above which comprises dissolving a polymerizable monomeric acid<br>
chloride in a solution of an alkali, separately preparing an aqueous solution of a spacer,<br>
bringing the temperature of the solutions to 5 to 10°C, adding drop wise the solution of<br>
polymerizable monomeric acid chloride to the solution of the spacer, maintaining pH of the<br>
mixture 7.4 to 7.8 by the addition of the alkali solution, and the temperature 5 to 10°C during<br>
addition removing the unreacted monomeric acid chloride by solvent extraction, acidifying<br>
the reaction mixture to pH 5 to 5.5, and solvent extracting the reaction mixture, precipitating<br>
using a non solvent to obtain the monomeric-spacer conjugate, drying under vacuum at room<br>
temperature, dissolving the conjugate in an organic solvent, adding to this a carbohydrate<br>
ligand, adding to this reaction mixture a coupling agent, allowing the reaction for a period of<br>
24 to 48 hrs at room temperature, removing the unreacted coupling agent, treating the clear<br>
solution with a solvent to obtain the polymerizable monomer.<br>
The polymerizable monomeric acid chloride is preferably selected from methacryloyl<br>
or acryloyl chloride. In another embodiment the alkali comprises 10 to 20% solution of<br>
hydroxide, bicarbonate or carbonate of alkali metal exemplified by NaOH, KOH, NaHCOs,<br>
Na2CO3.<br>
The spacer may include bifunctional compounds having a reactive site for bonding<br>
with the monomeric acid chloride and a reactive site for bonding with carbohydrate ligand,<br>
functional groups exemplified by OH, COOH or NH2 such as 4-Amino Butyric (4-ABA)Acid<br>
,6-Ammo Caproic Acid (6-AC A), 10-Amino Decanoic Acid (10-AD A), 1, 4-diaminobutane,<br>
hexamethylenediamine, 1,4-butanediol. The solvent used for solvent extraction of unreacted<br>
monomeric spacer may be non solvent to the monomeric spacer exemplified by ethyl or<br>
methyl acetate. The acidification may be done by using mineral acids having concentration of<br>
5 to 20%. The organic solvent used to dissolve the conjugate may be such as dimethyl<br>
formamide, tetra hydro furan or di-methyl sulfoxide.<br>
In yet another embodiment the carbohydrate ligand is NAG, sialic acid, mannose or<br>
galactose. The coupling agent used is selected from compounds such as Di Cyclohexyl<br>
Carbodiimide (DCC), I-Cyclohexyl 3-(2- Morpholinoethyl) Carbodiimide metho-ptoluenesulfonate(<br>
CMC), I-Ethyl-3-(3-Dimethylamino-propyl) Carbodiimide(EDC).<br>
The non solvent used to precipitate the polymerizable monomer is selected from<br>
acetone, diethyl ether or hexane. The molar ratio of monomeric acid chloride to amino acid<br>
used for the synthesis of the monomer is 1: 1. The molar ratio of coupling agent for<br>
condensation of monomeric spacer to carbohydrate ligand is 1: 1. The molar ratios of<br>
polymerizable monomeric acid chloride to spacer are in the range from 0.1: 1 to 1: 0.1,<br>
preferably 0.5 to 1 to 1:0.5, more preferably from 0.8: 1 to 1: 0.8.<br>
In a feature of the present invention the conjugation of the monomer with the ligand is<br>
preferably effected through a spacer. The "spacer "provides greater accessibility to the ligand<br>
conjugate for binding with receptor biomolecule.<br>
In yet another feature the polymerizable acid chloride is linked to NAG through<br>
CHjOH group ,a feature not present in chitosan, chitin and/or other derivatives of NAG so far<br>
reported in the literature.<br>
In yet another feature the method used for estimation of the relative inhibition is in<br>
terms of 150 mM and I max rnM values.<br>
In yet another feature the binding between lysozyme and the monomeric ligandcontaining<br>
NAG is enhanced.<br>
The process reported herein for the incorporation of NAG into monomers is relatively<br>
simple. Besides the monomers are effective at very low ligand concentration, which is an<br>
advantage when the ligands under consideration are expensive e.g. sialic acid.<br>
It is also expected that the presence of multiple NAG ligands in the polymer backbone<br>
will enhance binding to the viruses and bio molecules such as influenza, rotavirus, Wheat<br>
Germ Agglutinin (WGA). The polymers containing multiple ligands can potentially interact<br>
with multiple receptors simultaneously thereby enhancing the binding to lysozyme.<br>
The ability of these ligands to inhibit enzyme activity provides new ways of<br>
developing effective inhibitors. The monomers synthesized indicate enhanced substrate<br>
ligand interactions and can be used in diverse applications such as in immunoassays and<br>
affinity separations.<br>
The present invention relates to the monomers containing carbohydrate moieties and<br>
preparation thereof. The monomer may comprise a spacer arm, which is inserted between the<br>
vinyl group and the ligand. These monomers may be used for the synthesis of homopolymers,<br>
oligomers and copolymers for the recovery of biomolecules.<br>
The polymers comprising carbohydrate monomer conjugates may also further be used<br>
in the treatment of bacterial or viral infections, and are expected not to cause drug resistance.<br>
Monomers containing NAG exhibit enhanced hydrolytic stability and water solubility<br>
than natural polymers containing NAG such as chitosan . The monomers containing NAG<br>
may be used for polymerization or oligomerization. They may be also used as anti infective<br>
agents both for prevention and treatment of diseases, recovery of the naturally occurring as<br>
well as genetically manipulated biomolecules.<br>
The approach described herein is a generic one and can be extended to other systems<br>
as well. For example sialic acid ligands are known to bind to influenza virus and rotavirus.<br>
Hence polymers comprising sialic acid can be expected to bind to the two viruses more<br>
strongly than the corresponding monomers.<br>
The present invention provides methods for the preparation of polymerizable<br>
monomers containing N-Acetyl Glucosamine, which can be oligomerized or polymerized as<br>
desired. These monomers provide improved binding and inhibition of bio molecules and their<br>
efficacy can be further enhanced by polymerization.<br>
The polymerizable monomers provided by the present invention may comprise a<br>
spacer arm, which is inserted between the vinyl group and the carbohydrate ligand. These<br>
monomers are useful for the synthesis of homopolymers, oligomers and copolymers for<br>
inhibition of viral infections and the recoveries of biomolecular.<br>
The process for the preparation of the polymerizable ligands is illustrated herein<br>
below with reference to examples which are illustrative only and should not be construed to<br>
limit the scope of the present invention in any manner.<br>

Phosphate buffer was added to make the volume to 2 ml. The fluorescence intensities<br>
of the solutions were measured, relative to the solutions containing enzymes and buffer<br>
mixtures of the identical concentrations reference. The relative fluorescence intensity of<br>
lysozyme saturated with solution containing different ligand concentration, Foe, was<br>
extrapolated from the experimental values by plotting I/ (F0-F) against 1/[S] where F is the<br>
measured fluorescence of a solution containing enzyme with given substrate concentration<br>
[S] and Fo is the fluorescence of a solution of enzyme alone (Chipman et al., J. Biol. Chem.,<br>
242-19, 4388-4394,1967). The highest concentration of polymer substrates was used when<br>
enzyme was saturated more than 85 %.<br>
(Figure Removed) The binding constants of polymerizable monomers are summarized in Table 1<br>
wherein, N-Acetyl Glucosamine has binding constant 5.24 x 102 where as that for the<br>
monomer Ac. NAG is 7.07 x 104. The increase in binding constant is 74 times.<br>
With the incorporation of spacer arm 6-ACA the binding constants is further<br>
increased to 1.97 x 10 5, almost 2650 times compared to N-Acetyl Glucosamine.<br>
Example 5<br>
This example describes the estimation of inhibition of lysozyme by monomers<br>
Micrococcus lysodeikticus is a substrate for the enzyme lysozyme. Relative binding of<br>
monomers and monomers linked to NAG through the spacer arm was estimated by using a<br>
procedure reported by Neuberger and Wilson (1967).<br>
1.5 % w/v stock solutions of monomeric ligands was prepared in 0.0066 M phosphate<br>
buffer pH 6.2 containing 0.0154 m sodium chloride and 0.008 M sodium azide. One milliliter<br>
of stock solution containing different ligand concentration was mixed with 1.6 ml of 78<br>
Jig/ml of Micrococcus lysodeikticus in a 3-ml capacity glass cuvette. The mixture was<br>
incubated for 5 minutes at 20 0 C. To this mixture 0.1 ml of lysozyme (27 ug/ml) was added<br>
and mixed thoroughly. The relative absorbance at 450 nm (A4so) was recorded for 30 seconds.<br>
A blank reading without the ligand was noted and the change in the absorbance per second<br>
was calculated. Then relative inhibition was calculated.<br>
(Table Removed) The relative inhibition of lysozyme in terms of I 50 for monomer NAG is 74.00 mM<br>
and has decreased to 14.81 mM ,which is almost 5 times lower. Whereas the I max has<br>
decreased from 55.29 to 50 for the monomer containing NAG.<br>
I max has decreased from 55.29 mM to 14.81 mM (Table 2).<br>
The relative inhibition I 50 has decreased from 74 mM to 0.035 mM which is almost<br>
to 2110 folds lower than that for NAG indicating enhanced efficacy of inhibition.<br><br><br><br><br>
