				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to automatic quality of service<br>
class management, and in particular to automatic quality of<br>
service class management methods and networking nodes<br>
operated in support of an application running on top of a<br>
bearer service.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
In XP-002325835, there is described a 3GPP technical<br>
specification of group services and system aspects, in<br>
particular an end-to-end quality of service concept and<br>
architecture. Also, there are described IP level mechanisms<br>
necessary in providing end-to-end quality of service<br>
involving GPRS networks, including possible interaction<br>
between the IP level and the GPRS level, as well as the<br>
application level and the IP level.<br>
Also, in XP-002325836, there is described an operation of a<br>
charging gateway and a related PDP context information with<br>
respect to session management parameters. Here, a quality of<br>
service profile information element includes quality of<br>
service negotiated between the mobile station and a serving<br>
data support node at PDP context activation or a. new quality<br>
2<br><br>
of service QoS negotiated in the PDP context modification<br>
procedure.<br>
Further, in XP-002325837, there is described a 3GPP technical<br>
specification of architectural enhancements for end-to-end<br>
quality of service operation. In particular, there is<br>
described a concept of an admission administrative domain,<br>
wherein the admission administrative domain defines a set of<br>
bearer devices and gateway whose resources and routes are<br>
managed.<br>
Recently, the variety.of application sessions to be operated<br>
on top of a wireless bearer has significantly increased.<br>
Typical examples are video clips, SMS short message services,<br>
MMS multi-media message services, ring tone downloads, WAP<br>
services, wireless WEB services, point-to-point multimedia<br>
services, etc.<br>
According to the different type of application sessions,<br>
usually different types of bearer services will be initiated,<br>
either in a core network or a wireless access network.<br>
Further, different application services require different<br>
quality of service classes for the underlying bearer services<br>
specifying maximum bit rate, delivery order, maximum service<br>
data unit size, service data unit format information, service<br>
3<br><br>
data unit error ratio, bit error ratio, delivery of erroneous<br>
service data units, transfer delay, guaranteed bit rate,<br>
traffic handling priority, allocation/retention priority,<br>
source statistics descriptor, signaling indication, to name<br>
just some of bearer service attributes specified according to<br>
quality of service classes.<br>
However, with existing solutions for identifying quality of<br>
service class for a specific application session in view of<br>
available bearer services a problem is that the application<br>
session running in the end terminal needs to request via an<br>
application programming interface from the bearer service a<br>
certain quality of service class. This requires that the<br>
 application session as such needs to toe updated regarding<br>
functionality for quality of service class specification.<br>
Further, the conventional technology requires that the<br>
application session is aware of available quality of service<br>
class definitions on the bearer service level, which quality<br>
of service class definitions may differ and vary according to<br>
different standardizations.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
In view of the above, the object of the present invention is<br>
to enhance quality of service management in support of<br>
application sessions running on top of bearer services.<br>
According to the present invention, this object is achieved,<br>
firstly, by a method of bearer service analysis in support of<br>
automatic quality of service class management. According to<br>
this method, a bearer service carrying packet switched<br>
4<br><br>
service traffic in support of an application session is<br>
analyzed for identification of at least one type of service<br>
used for the application session. Then, the result of bearer<br>
service analysis is forwarded to a networking unit adapted to<br>
automatic quality of. service class management according to<br>
the identified at least one least one type of service.<br>
Also, according to the present invention, the analysis of<br>
bearer services is achieved by applying a filtering approach,<br>
in particular with respect to characteristics of protocols<br>
used for exchange of packet switched service traffic.<br>
Preferably, such characteristics may identify address ranges,<br>
port number ranges and/or protocol types.<br>
According to the present invention, an analysis of bearer<br>
service may be based on reuse of information determined for<br>
flexible bearer service charges. A preferred embodiment of<br>
the present invention, is particularly efficient in that only<br>
information already derived for charging of networking<br>
functionality may be reused for automatic quality of service<br>
charging.<br>
AN important advantage of the present invention is that<br>
through the analysis of the bearer service carrying the<br>
packet switched traffic in support of an application session,<br>
it is possible to avoid involvement of the application<br>
session itself in the determination of type of service and<br>
related necessary quality of service classes.<br>
In other words, the application session itself may just<br>
initiate necessary traffic via bearer service in view of<br>
application requirements without being aware, firstly, of<br>
related quality of service class requirements and, secondly,<br>
5<br><br>
available bearer services at all. It is through forwarding of<br>
the result of the bearer analysis to the networking unit<br>
which handles quality of service class that management of the<br>
quality of service class is done in an automatic manner<br>
according to bearer service traffic rated in view of the<br>
application sessions.<br>
Further preferred embodiments of the present invention relate<br>
to the method of bearer service analysis.<br>
A further preferred embodiment, of the present invention with<br>
respect to bearer service analysis relies on identification<br>
of characteristics of actual service traffic. Such<br>
characteristics may preferably relate to, e.g., average<br>
length of a service message and/or timing lapsing between two<br>
service messages as characteristics identifying quality of<br>
service class requirements.<br>
A further preferred embodiment of the present invention<br>
regarding analysis of bearer service requests a highest<br>
quality of service class at the beginning of bearer service<br>
delivery, which is of particular advantage in that during<br>
wrap-up of a bearer service delivery situation, an<br>
application session remains inoperative due to lack of<br>
sufficient bearer service capacity which is strictly avoided.<br>
Further to the aspect of bearer analysis, the object outlined<br>
above is achieved by a method of automatic quality of service<br>
class management in support of an application session running<br>
on top of a bearer service carrying packet switched traffic.<br>
Here, it is suggested that an indicabion of at least one type<br>
of service used by an application session is achieved at a<br>
networking node managing the quality of service class. Then,<br>
6<br><br>
a quality of service class is determined according to at<br>
least one type of service used by the application session,<br>
and then a quality of service class is requested for the<br>
bearer service according to the determined quality of service<br>
class.<br>
Still further, for management of quality of service classes,<br>
it is suggested to keep track of quality of service classes<br>
requested according to type of service and/or to notify a<br>
flexible bearer charging unit adapted to change of bearer<br>
service delivery on the change of quality of service class.<br>
The first is beneficial in that a repeated requesting of<br>
quality of service classes not supported by the bearer<br>
network may be avoided. The latter is beneficial in that<br>
always appropriate charging will be achieved also in view of<br>
a change of quality of service class during ongoing bearer<br>
service delivery,<br>
In other words, according to the present invention, the<br>
setting of the quality of service class is done by a method<br>
of automatic quality service class management operated in a<br>
network and not by an application running at a user<br>
equipment. Therefore, the inventive approach allows for<br>
automatic selection of quality of service classes without<br>
involvement of user equipment and related application<br>
sessions running thereat to improve portability and network<br>
independency of application functionality at the user and<br>
equipment.<br>
Further preferred embodiments of the present invention are<br>
related to automatic quality of service management within the<br>
network providing the services.<br>
7<br><br>
Here, according to a preferred embodiment, it is suggested to<br>
determine a quality of service class from the at least one<br>
type of service ab initio for start of an application<br>
session.<br>
Alternatively, according to a second preferred embodiment of<br>
this aspect, one could consider an ongoing application<br>
session and related bearer services. Assuming that bearer<br>
service level of the network is adapted to select a quality<br>
of service on its own, according to the present invention it<br>
is suggested to compare such a bearer level initiating<br>
quality of service class with a quality of service class<br>
determined according to a type of service. Should such<br>
comparison indicate a deviation between the two different<br>
values for the quality of service class, it is then suggested<br>
to request a quality of service class change of the bearer<br>
service initiated by the networking node managing the quality<br>
of service class.<br>
Here, it should be noted that generally, according to the<br>
present invention, the bearer service analysis and the<br>
quality of service class may either be operated in different<br>
networking nodes operating on a stand-alone basis or,<br>
alternatively, be combined to a single networking node<br>
handling both aspects of bearer service handling and quality<br>
of service class management which would typically be a<br>
gateway networking node.<br>
Preferably, for the management of the quality of service<br>
class according to the present invention it is suggested to<br>
reference a mapping table establishing a relation between at<br>
least one type of service and a related quality of service<br>
class. Optionally, such a pre-storage of quality of service<br>
8<br><br>
class relating information may also be a quality of service<br>
class setting range, defining an allowable range of quality of<br>
service class with respect to a single application, a class<br>
of applications, etc. This allows to consider a throughput of<br>
application traffic for the bearer service network as a whole<br>
to avoid a bottleneck due to assignment of a too high quality<br>
of service class for a single application session.<br>
Yet another preferred embodiment of quality of service class<br>
management according to the present invention is related to<br>
involvement of an application user during quality of service<br>
class management, here, as option and as specific part of end<br>
user satisfaction enhancement.<br>
According to another preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention there is provided a computer program product<br>
directly loadable into the internal memory of a networking<br>
node adapted to bearer service analysis in support of<br>
automatic quality of service class management comprising<br>
software code portions for performing the inventive bearer<br>
service analysis process when the product is run on a<br>
processor of a networking node adapted to bearer service<br>
analysis.<br>
Also, according to another preferred embodiment of the<br>
present invention there is provided a. computer program<br>
product directly loadable into the internal memory of a<br>
networking node adapted to automatic quality of service class<br>
management in support of an application session running on<br>
top of a bearer service carrying packet switched traffic<br>
comprising software code portions for performing the<br>
inventive quality of service class management process when<br>
9<br><br>
the product is-run on a processor of the networking node<br>
adapted to automatic quality of service class management.<br>
Therefore, the present invention is also provided to achieve<br>
an implementation of the inventive method steps on computer<br>
or processor systems. In conclusion, such implementation<br>
leads to the provision of computer program products for use<br>
with a computer system or more specifically a processor<br>
comprised in e.g., an apparatus for automatic quality of<br>
service class management.<br>
This programs defining the functions of the present invention<br>
can be delivered to a computer/processor in many forms,<br>
including, but not limited to information permanently stored<br>
on non-writable storage media, e.g., read only memory devices<br>
such as ROM or CD ROM discs readable by processors or<br>
computer I/O attachments; information stored on writable<br>
storage media, i,e. floppy discs and hard drives; or<br>
information convey to a computer/processor through<br>
communication media such as network and/or Internet and/or<br>
telephone networks via moderns or other interface devices. It<br>
should be understood that such media, when carrying processor<br>
readable instructions implementing the inventive concept<br>
represent alternate embodiments of the present invention.<br>
Thus, according to the present invention it is an important<br>
advantage that a user of an application does need to<br>
configure a quality of service class for an application<br>
session he is initiating. Also, application sessions running<br>
on a user equipment do not used to be updated for setting of<br>
quality of service classes, and further the user equipment<br>
does not need to be involved and to be provided with<br>
10<br><br>
information about quality of service class definition which is<br>
used in the network running the bearer services.<br>

BEST MODE AND PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF INVENTION<br>
In the following, the best mode of the present invention as well<br>
as preferred embodiments thereof will be described with<br>
reference to the drawing. Insofar as different aspects, concepts<br>
and features of the present invention are described either on<br>
the level of function or structure, it should be noted that any<br>
such functionality according to the present invention may be<br>
realized either in software, hardware and/or a combination<br>
thereof.<br>
As will be outlined in more detail in the following, the present<br>
invention relates to the aspects of bearer service analysis and,<br>
on the basis thereof, to quality of service class management in<br>
support of application sessions running on top of a bearer<br>
service. Heretofore, a first networking node is related to the<br>
aspect of bearer service analysis, and a second networking node<br>
is related to the aspect of quality of service class management.<br>
Either both networking nodes are operated independently as<br>
stand-alone networking nodes, or integrated into one networking<br>
unit operated for delivery of bearer services.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a schematic diagram of a networking node scene<br>
adapted to bearer service analysis in support of automatic<br>
quality of service class management.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, the networking node 10 adapted to bearer<br>
service analysis comprises a bearer service analysis unit 12<br>
adapted to analyze a bearer service carrying packet switched<br>
service traffic in support an application session for<br>
12<br><br>
identification of at least one type of service used via the<br>
application session, and an interface unit 14 adapted to forward<br>
a result of bearer service analysis to a networking unit adapted<br>
to automatic quality of service class management according to<br>
the identified at least one type of service. Here, it should be<br>
noted that according to the present invention, the different<br>
structure of the units of the networking node 10 may be<br>
implemented using commercially available other components and<br>
processors, through application of special purpose hardware, or<br>
through development of appropriate computer program products.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a flowchart of operation of the networking node 10<br>
adapted to bearer service analysis shown in Fig. 1.<br>
As shown in Fig. 2, operatively the bearer service analysis unit<br>
10 executes a step S10 to analyze a bearer service carrying<br>
packet switched traffic for identification of a type of service.<br>
The basis thereof, the interface unit 14, executes a step S12 to<br>
forward the bearer service analysis result to a quality of<br>
service class management unit to be explained in more detail in<br>
the following.<br>
In the step S10, the bearer service analysis unit 12 may analyze<br>
the bearer service by filtering characteristics of protocols<br>
used for exchange of packet switched service traffic which,<br>
e.g., can be related to addresses of data packets, port number<br>
of data packets, and/or protocol types. Here, typical examples<br>
of distinguishing between different contents and service types,<br>
e.g., implemented in a gateway GGSM are the identification of<br>
different services based on the following filtering criteria:<br>
IP address/net mask;<br>
13<br><br>
UDP/TCP port number or ranges;<br>
Protocol types and ICMP types; and/or<br>
WAPL.x, URI/URL, host name and folder, WAP<br>
2.x/http, URI/URL, host name and folder, WAP<br>
l.x/2.x connection signaling.<br>
As alternative to the above or in combination therewith, the<br>
step of analyzing a bearer service carrying packet switched<br>
service S10 may comprise a reuse of information determined for<br>
flexible bearer service charging.<br>
Here, this approach of the present invention relates to concepts<br>
of flexible bearer charging where three different types of<br>
possible charging are applied in a packet switched bearer<br>
network:<br>
Contents charging: Charging is based on the<br>
actual content value. Here, content charging is<br>
applicable when users purchase a content. The charging<br>
type is preferably performed using charging information<br>
from a content server in a service networking domain.<br>
Service: Charging is performed per transaction on a<br>
particular service, e.g., per short message service SMS<br>
per or multi-media message service MMS. This type of<br>
charging is preferably performed using charging<br>
information from an application server in the service<br>
networking domain.<br>
Bearer charging: Charging is based on the<br>
14<br><br>
transferred volume or application session duration if a<br>
charging is comparable to consume minutes for voice<br>
call in the circuit switched domain. This charging type<br>
is preferably performed in a network node of a core<br>
networking domain.<br>
From the above, it becomes clear that in view of the different<br>
prizing models, all these prizing models imply the derivation of<br>
information that also serves to identify the type of service<br>
which may then be forwarded to a networking node handling<br>
management of quality of service class, as will be explained in<br>
more detail in the following.<br>
Further to the above, operatively the bearer service analysis<br>
unit 12 may also analyze the bearer service in a step S10 in<br>
view of identifying characteristics of the packet switched<br>
service traffic. This implies that the bearer service analysis<br>
unit 12 identifies, e.g., the average length of a service<br>
message and/or timing lapsing between two service messages,<br>
etc., which may then form the basis for identifying the type of<br>
service. Typically, the length of a service message may be<br>
related to the amount of data transferred between the different<br>
application end points, and timing lapsing between two service<br>
messages may be used to characterize burstiness of application<br>
related traffic.<br>
In the following, further aspects of the present invention being<br>
related to quality of service class management will be<br>
illustrated with respect to Figs. 3 and 4.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a schematic diagram of a networking node 16 adapted<br>
to automatic quality of service class management in support of<br>
15<br><br>
an application session running on top of a bearer service<br>
carrying packet switched traffic.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a flowchart of operation of the networking node 16<br>
adapted to automatic quality of service class management shown<br>
in Fig. 3.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3, the networking node adapted to automatic<br>
quality of service class management at least comprises an<br>
interface unit 18, a quality of service class assignment unit 20<br>
and a quality of service class controlling unit 22. Optionally,<br>
the networking node 16 adapted to automatic quality of service<br>
class management may also comprise a quality of service class<br>
comparison unit 24, a quality of service class evaluation unit<br>
26, and a quality of service class memory unit 28.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a flowchart of operation of the networking node 16<br>
adapted to automatic quality of service class management shown<br>
in Fig. 3.<br>
As shown in Fig. 4, in a step S14 the interface unit 18 shown in<br>
Fig. 3 evaluates the receipt of an indication of at least one<br>
type of service used by an application session. This receipt is<br>
in correlation to the forwarding of a related indication of type<br>
of service by the networking node 10 adapted to bearer service<br>
analysis as outlined above with respect to Figs. 1 and 2.<br>
Further, should clarification of a type of service be received<br>
in the step S14, the further operation of the networking node 16<br>
will be delayed until indication of such a receipt.<br>
As shown in Fig. 4, operatively the quality of service class<br>
assignment unit 20 will execute a step S16 to assign a quality<br>
16<br><br>
of service class according to at least the type of services by<br>
the application session.<br>
As shown in Fig. 4, operatively the quality of service class<br>
controlling unit 22 will execute a step S18 for requesting a<br>
quality of service class determined in step S16 from the bearer<br>
service level.<br>
While above quality of service classes have been referred to in<br>
general, a typical example of such quality of service classes<br>
could be:<br>
Traffic class: This is a quality of service class<br>
reporting fundamental characteristics for basic service<br>
delivery.<br>
Conversational class: This quality of service class<br>
preserves a time relation/ variation between<br>
information entities of a data stream and is typically<br>
selected for voice applications.<br>
Streaming class: This quality of service class<br>
preserves time relation/ variation between information<br>
entities of a data stream and is adapted, e.g., to the<br>
streaming of video.<br>
Interactive class: This quality of service class is<br>
related to best effort and adapted to request response<br>
pattern. The interactive class preserves payload<br>
content and is typically adapted to, e.g., web<br>

Background: This quality of service class is<br>
provided for destinations which do not expect a data<br>
within a certain time limit, nevertheless, preserves<br>
payload content. It is typically applied to background<br>
applications like download of emails.<br>
It should be noted that one typical field of application of the<br>
quality of service classes listed above is mobile communication,<br>
e.g., according to UMTS. Further, it is important to keep in<br>
mind that a quality of service class is an end-to-end<br>
application characteristic between two communicating<br>
applications, which means that quality of service classes needs<br>
to be negotiated and then mapped to bearer service attributes.<br>
One example of the mapping of a quality of service class<br>
determined on a quality of service class management level onto<br>
attributes on the bearer service level like maximum bit rate,<br>
delivery order, maximum service data unit SDU size, service data<br>
unit SDU format information, service data unit SDU error ratio,<br>
residual bit error ratio, delivery of erroneous service data<br>
units, transfer delay, guaranteed bit rate, traffic handling<br>
priority, allocation/retention priority, source statistics<br>
descriptor, signaling indication, etc., could be as follows:<br><br>

In the following, further steps of quality of service class<br>
determination according to the present invention will be<br>
explained. Here, it is to be noted that these steps are to be<br>
optional and not mandatory during execution of the quality of<br>
service class management according to the present invention.<br>
19<br><br>
As shown in Fig. 4, a first such optional step S20 relates to<br>
the initiation of the overall quality of service class<br>
management process and is executed by the quality of service<br>
class controlling unit 22. Here, according to the present<br>
invention, a quality of service class controlling unit 22<br>
assigns the highest quality of service class at the very<br>
beginning of quality of service class management to ensure<br>
appropriate initiation of bearer services in support of related<br>
application sessions.<br>
A further optional aspect of quality of service class management<br>
according to the present invention is related to interaction<br>
between the higher networking levels handling quality of service<br>
classes and the bearer service level. While existing<br>
communication networks have installed mechanisms that allow for<br>
quality of service class determination of the bearer service<br>
level, these quality of service classes are, as has been<br>
explained above, usually derived through interaction with the<br>
application sessions. However, according to the present<br>
invention, there is proposed to have an interaction between the<br>
bearer service level and the upper networking levels identifying<br>
a quality of service class in view of the analyzed type of<br>
service. Here, in a step S22 the quality of service class<br>
comparison unit 24 will compare the quality of service class<br>
derived from the type of service with the quality of service<br>
class determined on the bearer level. Should any deviation<br>
occur, then the quality of service class controlling unit 22<br>
will execute the step S18 to request a quality of service class<br>
change at the bearer service level. Otherwise, the quality of<br>
service class controlling unit 22 will run idle so that no<br>
20<br><br>
request for quality of service class change will be forwarded to<br>
the bearer service level.<br>
Further, the determination of a quality of service class<br>
according to the type of quality service in step S16 may be<br>
determined by referencing a mapping table establishing a<br>
relation between the at least one type of service and a quality<br>
of service, i.e. a related data base. The same data base or a<br>
different data base may also be used for storing an allowable<br>
range of quality of service classes on the bearer level which<br>
will also be referred to as quality of service class setting<br>
range in the following.<br>
As shown in Fig. 4, the storage of a quality of service class<br>
setting range forms the prerequisite of the execution of a step<br>
S24 preceding the submission of a request to a quality of<br>
service class change request to the bearer service level. In<br>
this step S24, operatively executed by the quality of service<br>
class controlling unit 22, it is determined whether a quality of<br>
service class determined on the upper networking layer according<br>
to the type of service is allowable in view of the predetermined<br>
quality of service class setting range. If this is not the case,<br>
the procedure shown in Fig. 4 will branch back to step S14 to<br>
await indication of a new type of service for subsequent<br>
determination of the quality of service class. Otherwise, the<br>
request for the quality of service class change is allowable and<br>
will be forwarded to the bearer service level according to step<br>
S18.<br>
As shown in Fig. 4, optionally the quality of service class<br>
controlling unit 22 will execute a step S26 to forward the<br>
determined quality of service class/quality of service class<br>
21<br><br>
change to a flexible charging unit, which determines charges for<br>
delivered bearer services. This allows to always accurately<br>
determine charges irrespective of changes in quality of service<br>
charges in real-time accuracy.<br>
As shown in Fig. 4, optionally the quality of service class<br>
controlling unit 22 will store determined quality of service<br>
classes in the quality of service class memory unit 28. This is<br>
particularly beneficial when a request for a quality of service<br>
class change has been rejected, e.g., as lying outside a<br>
predetermined quality of service class setting range. Then, a<br>
reiterated resource consuming request of a same quality of<br>
service charge may be avoided for sake of networking resources.<br>
For the same reason, in the quality of service class memory unit<br>
also a notification of rejection of a request for quality of<br>
service class forwarded to the quality of service class<br>
management unit from the level of the bearer services may be<br>
stored therein.<br>
Yet another option for the execution of the present invention<br>
would be to involve end equipment, e.g., a user terminal, during<br>
settlement of a quality of service class. Here, optionally a<br>
request for change of quality of service class may be forwarded<br>
to an end terminal using the bearer service and running an<br>
application for which the request for change of quality service<br>
is initiated. Then, the request for change of quality of service<br>
class forwarded from the quality of service class management<br>
unit 16 to the end terminal may be compared with the quality of<br>
service class setting range which may be pre-stored at the end<br>
terminal for approval of the requested change of quality of<br>
service class. Alternatively or in combination, the approval of<br>
the request for change of quality of service class may be<br>
22<br><br>
achieved at the end terminal by prompting an end terminal user<br>
accordingly. Then, either after approval of the change of<br>
quality of service class the quality of service management unit<br>
will be notified accordingly, or otherwise a notification of<br>
rejection of the request of change of quality of service class<br>
will be returned from the end terminal to the quality of service<br>
class management unit.<br>
In the following, an application of the inventive quality of<br>
service management concepts outlined so far with respect to<br>
Figs. 1 to 4 will be explained with respect to an application<br>
scenario shown in Fig. 5.<br>
As shown in Fig. 5, one application scenario relates to the<br>
interaction between an application terminal 30 and a remote<br>
terminal 32. The application terminal 30 contains a unit 34<br>
running the application, a connection termination unit 36, and a<br>
bearer service managing unit 38. Similarly, the remote<br>
terminal/server 32 contains an application unit 40, a connection<br>
termination unit 42 and a bearer transport unit 44.<br>
As shown in Fig. 5, the application terminal 30 and the remote<br>
terminal/server 32 are therefore embodied to allow for an end-<br>
to-end flow of application data. One typical scenario would be<br>
the interaction between a wireline communication network wherein<br>
the remote terminal/server 32 is operated in a wireless<br>
application terminal 30, e.g., in the form of a mobile<br>
telephone, a PDA, a laptop, etc.<br>
As shown in Fig. 5, heretofore the remote terminal/server 32 is<br>
connected on a bearer transport level 44 to a router 46. A<br>
router 46 contains a routing device 48, which receives transport<br>
23<br><br>
data from the remote terminal/server 32 and forwards it to a<br>
bearer transport channel 50. The bearer transport unit 50 is<br>
linking the router 46 with a gateway 52 provided for coupling<br>
the remote terminal/server domain network with the application<br>
terminal wireless network domain.<br>
As shown in Fig. 5, for the related application scenario the<br>
bearer transport channel 50 is connected to a routing device 54<br>
of the gateway 52. The routing device 54 is interacting with a<br>
flexible charging unit 56 determining charges for bearer<br>
service. Further, the routing device 54 is interworking with the<br>
quality of service management unit 16 incorporated into the<br>
gateway 52. The quality of service management unit 16<br>
interrogates a mapping table and a quality of service setting<br>
range from a data base 58 operated in combination with the<br>
gateway 52. Further, the routing device 54 is interacting with a<br>
bearer service manager 60 operated in the gateway 52 for<br>
exchange of data between the gateway 52 and the application<br>
terminal 30 in the application terminal networking domain. The<br>
bearer service analysis unit 10 according to the present<br>
invention is, as one example, shown as incorporated in the<br>
routing device 54 of the present invention for analysis of<br>
bearer service characteristics. Here, it should be noted that<br>
the bearer service analysis unit 10 may also be operated<br>
separately from the routing device 54 or as stand-alone unit<br>
outside the gateway 52, as outlined above.<br>
As shown in Fig. 5, the bearer service managing unit 16 is<br>
cooperating with a bearer service managing unit 62 of a<br>
switching node/radio access unit 64 operated in the application<br>
terminal networking domain. The bearer service managing unit 62<br>
of the switching node/radio access node is cooperating with a<br>
24<br><br>
bearer service managing unit 38 for exchange of data on the<br>
bearer service level.<br>
From the above, it becomes clear that according to the present<br>
invention it is suggested to incorporate the bearer service<br>
analysis unit and any quality of service management unit into<br>
the quality of service framework, e.g., in the gateway 52. The<br>
end-to-end quality of service architecture according to the<br>
present invention is designed to meet a wide range of<br>
application quality of service requirements and to provide<br>
efficient network utilization, in particular via the radio<br>
interface.<br>
Further, the application layer relies on quality of service<br>
functionalities in different parts of the end-to-end path. The<br>
services executed between the quality of service management unit<br>
16 and the bearer service analysis unit 10 reflect the<br>
characteristics/parameters of higher layer application<br>
functionalities. The present invention uses control plane<br>
functions such as admission control and negotiation in order to<br>
distribute access to the shared set of resources in a fair and<br>
efficient manner between application end points. It ensures<br>
rejection of new service requests in periods of congestion in<br>
order not to excessively degrade the quality of service<br>
characteristics of existing bearer services in view of ongoing<br>
applications.<br>
Fig. 6 shows a further application scenario for the different<br>
quality of service management concepts underlying the present<br>
invention outlined above. In particular, the application<br>
scenario illustrated with respect to Fig. 6 is related to the<br>
application of the Internet protocol IP in the remote terminal<br>
25<br><br>
server networking domain and to the application of wireless<br>
communication on the basis of UMTS in the application terminal<br>
networking domain. Insofar as units shown in Fig. 6 have a<br>
functionality comparable to those of Fig. 5, they are indicated<br>
with similar primed reference numerals, and explanation thereof<br>
will not be repeated.<br>
As shown in Fig. 6, according to the application scenarios shown<br>
in Fig. 6, the termination 42' in the remote terminal server 32'<br>
is an IP termination interacting with an L2 transport channel<br>
44'. At the router 46', the routing device 48' is an IP routing<br>
device supporting DiffServ functions 66. The IP routing device<br>
cooperates with a L2 transport channel 50' for exchange of<br>
application data with a gateway 52' which in the application<br>
scenario shown in Fig. 6 is a gateway GPRS support node GGSN.<br>
As shown in Fig. 6, the gateway GPRS support node GGSN 52'<br>
comprises the routing device 54' being adapted to the IP<br>
protocol. The IP routing device 54' has an IPBS manager 16'<br>
executing the functionality of the quality of service management<br>
unit 16 shown previously with respect to Figs. 3 and 5, further<br>
the bearer analysis unit 10', which in addition to the bearer<br>
analysis functionality also has a flexible charging<br>
functionality. The IP routing device 54' also comprises a<br>
DiffServ function unit 68 in support of related IP<br>
functionality.<br>
As shown in Fig. 6, the IP routing device 54' interacts with a<br>
GPRS/CDMA managing unit 60' at instantiation of the bearer<br>
service management unit 60 shown in Fig. 5. The GPRS/CDMA<br>
management unit 60' establishes a PDB context with a related<br>
GPRS/CDMA managing unit 62' of the switching node/radio access<br>
26<br><br>
64', which according to the application example shown in Fig. 6<br>
is a serving GPRS support node SGSN. The GPRS/CDMA managing unit<br>
62' of the supporting GPRS support node SGSN 54' establishes a<br>
PDB context with a GPRS/CDMA managing unit 38' of the<br>
application terminal 30' via a UTRAN/BSS networking unit 70.<br>
Here, data exchange between the supporting GPRS support node<br>
SGSN and the gateway GPRS support node 52' is executed via GnP,<br>
and further the data exchange between the supporting GPRS<br>
support node SGSN and the UTRAN/BSS networking node 70 is<br>
achieved via IuPS or Gp, and further the data exchange between<br>
the UTRAN/BSS networking node 70 and the GPRS/CDMA managing unit<br>
38' of the application terminal 30' is achieved via Uu/Um. As<br>
shown in Fig. 6, the IP termination unit 36' of the application<br>
terminal 30' also comprises an IP managing unit for handling of<br>
quality of service management related issues at the application<br>
terminal 30' side.<br>
Therefore, the application scenario shown in Fig. 6 relates to<br>
wireless IP networks and to QoS development towards fixed IP<br>
networks for set-up of a 3GPP QoS architecture. For the<br>
application scenario shown in Fig. 6, here again application<br>
entities require a determination of quality of service enabled<br>
bearer services between them. Therefore, for the application<br>
session it must be decided what media streams will be used,<br>
e.g., voice and video, and what performance requirements these<br>
media streams put on the quality of service enabled bearer<br>
services. These requirements are then consecutively fulfilled<br>
and mapped onto quality of service parameters of the available<br>
bearer services.<br>
Also, as shown in Fig. 6, quality of service management<br>
according to the present invention is executed across different<br>
27<br><br>
quality of service enabled networking domains interworking with<br>
each other via a gateway node 52' . The gateway GPRS supporting<br>
node GGSN shown as an example in Fig. 6 provides interworking<br>
functionality between the WCDMA/GPRS quality of service<br>
mechanisms and the IP QoS mechanisms in an automized manner<br>
without involvement of the end applications. As outlined<br>
previously, interworking at the gateway GPRS supporting node<br>
GGSN includes classification, mapping, marking/remarking and<br>
filtering for appropriate bearer service delivery. In addition,<br>
end-to-end application signaling may include information on<br>
successful establishment of local access bearer at each side.<br>
For the application scenario shown in Fig. 6, the ideas<br>
underlying the present invention have been implemented by using<br>
information available at the gateway GPRS support node GGSN for<br>
selection of a quality of service class in automized manner.<br>
As shown in Fig. 6, the application terminal 30' is not adapted<br>
to request a quality of service class from the IPBS managing<br>
unit 72. Further, a charging unit provided in the gateway GPRS<br>
supporting node 52' and a bearer service analysis unit 10'<br>
inform the IPBS managers 16' of the gateway GPRS supporting node<br>
GGSN 52' about an identified bearer service characteristic and<br>
related type of service. According to the present invention, it<br>
is then suggested that the IPBS manager of the gateway GPRS<br>
support node GGSN interacts with the GPRS/CDMA managing unit 60'<br>
to request from the WCDMA/GPRS BS managing unit 60' a quality of<br>
service change. Alternatively, the IPBS managing unit 16'<br>
interacts with the IPBS managing unit 72 of the application<br>
terminal 30' for confirmation of a quality of service of change<br>
request.<br>
28<br><br>
Here, according to the present invention it is suggested to use<br>
the flexible bearer charging which is available in the gateway<br>
GPRS support node 52'. The reason for this is that already the<br>
flexible bearer charging function examines the bearer service<br>
and performs a packet identification and service classification.<br>
Packet inspection means that the IP address, the UDP/TCP port<br>
and the high layer protocols which are used in the bearer<br>
connections are evaluated in the analysis/flexible charging unit<br>
10' shown in Fig. 6. This information is then used to identify<br>
the bearer service which is performed via the respective bearer<br>
which information is used for charging the user dependent on the<br>
requested bearer service.<br>
According to the present invention, it is suggested to use this<br>
information, which is already derived for the purpose of<br>
flexible bearer charging, to select a quality of service class<br>
in the IPBS manager 16'. A gateway GPRS support node GGSN 52'<br>
requests from the supporting GPRS support node SGSN 64' a change<br>
of quality of service class in dependency of the used bearer<br>
service.<br>
A possible scenario would be that a user connects his<br>
application terminal 30', e.g., a notebook via GPRS to the<br>
Internet. By default, the lowest quality of service class or the<br>
highest quality of service class could be used at the beginning.<br>
Then, the user would start to download a file, and a packet<br>
inspection mechanism in the gateway GPRS support node would<br>
identify the protocol TCP and ftp as used protocols. In this<br>
case, the quality of service class would be maintained on a low<br>
level. After the download, the user would then start, e.g., a<br>
session initiated protocol SIP telephone session. Here, the<br>
packet inspection mechanism in the analysis/flexible charging<br>
29<br><br>
unit 10' would identify UDP and SIP as used protocols and would<br>
request from the supporting GPRS support node SGSN 64' to assign<br>
a higher quality of service class. The charging would be adapted<br>
accordingly.<br>
In more detail, for the application scenario shown in Fig. 6 it<br>
is suggested to reuse information of flexible bearer charging.<br>
The flexible bearer charging would filter certain parameters<br>
like protocol type, etc., of the IP connection and use a mapping<br>
table to determine a certain quality of service class. Then, the<br>
flexible bearer charging executed in the analysis/flexible<br>
charging unit 10' would trigger a request from the IPBS manager<br>
16' to the GPRS/CDMA managing unit 60' to adapt the quality of<br>
service class accordingly. This could imply a comparison of<br>
quality of service classes and a related amendment if they<br>
differed.<br>
As alternative, the analysis/flexible charging unit 10' could as<br>
well be enhanced in a way that besides protocol properties like<br>
IP addresses, port numbers, protocol types, also traffic<br>
characteristics like average message length, duration between<br>
two messages, etc., are taken into account for selecting a<br>
certain quality of service class. This implies that at the<br>
beginning the highest quality of service class would be chosen<br>
to allow for reliable measurement. A mapping table maintained at<br>
the quality of service class memory shown in Fig. 3 would allow<br>
to determine which quality of service class corresponds to which<br>
measured traffic characteristics.<br>
Then, the analysis/flexible charging unit 10' would initiate<br>
request from the IPBS manager 16' to compare the determined<br>
quality of service class with the quality of service class<br>
30<br><br>
operated at the bearer service level and to manage appropriate<br>
amendment thereof, should they differ.<br>
Besides the usage of the flexible bearer charging and the usage<br>
of flexible characteristics, a further aspect relates to the<br>
operation of the IPBS managing unit 16' in the gateway GPRS<br>
support node 52'.<br>
Here, the IPBS managing unit 16' in the gateway GPRS support<br>
node 52' could keep track of end-to-end quality service classes<br>
of ongoing application connections. As outlined above, the<br>
flexible bearer charging unit of the traffic characteristic<br>
evaluation could request from the IPBS managing unit information<br>
about the quality of service class of an ongoing IP connection<br>
and further eventually request a change of a quality of service<br>
class.<br>
Here, three different alternatives are possible as follows:<br>
i	The IPBS manager 16' requests from the CDMA/GPRS managing<br>
unit 16' to change a quality of service class of an ongoing<br>
connection. Heretofore, the gateway GPRS support node 52'<br>
also sends a quality of service class change request to the<br>
supporting GPRS support node 64'.<br>
ii.	The subscriber could define, e.g., in his HLR settings, the<br>
highest and lowest quality of service class he accepts.<br>
Then, the gateway GPRS support node GGSN 52' interrogates<br>
the home location register HLR to get the settings and<br>
compare them with the request for quality of service class<br>
change initiated by the IPBS manager 16'. If the requested<br>
change is within the subscriber setting, the IPBS managing<br>
31<br><br>
unit 16' requests from the WCDMA/GPRS managing unit 60' to<br>
change the quality of service class. Otherwise, the IPBS<br>
managing unit 16' informs the analysis/flexible charging<br>
unit 10' that the quality of service class change is<br>
refused. Optionally, the rejection of the requested change<br>
of quality of service class is tracked for the application<br>
sessions, so that no further request for quality of service<br>
charge change would arise again.<br>
iii. 	The IPBS managing unit 16' sends a request for quality of<br>
service class change to the IPBS managing unit of the<br>
application terminal 30' for approval thereof at the<br>
application terminal side 30'. Then, the user may evaluate<br>
his personal setting about acceptable quality of service<br>
classes or get a notification on his display for acceptance<br>
or rejection of the quality of service class change.<br>
As outlined above, according to the present invention a user<br>
does not need to configure a quality of service class on the<br>
application level. Further, the applications running at a user<br>
end equipment do not need to be updated for setting of quality<br>
of service classes. According to the present invention, the<br>
communication system automatically selects a correct quality of<br>
service class, and an application does not need to have<br>
knowledge about a quality of service class definition which may<br>
be used in a communication network.<br>

To enhance quality of service management in support of<br>
application sessions running on top of bearer services,<br>
according to the present invention it is suggested to,<br>
firstly, execute a bearer service analysis in support of<br>
automatic quality of service class management. Heretofore, a<br>
bearer service carrying packet switched service traffic in<br>
support of an application session is analysed for<br>
identification of different types of services by the<br>
application session. Related analysis information derived at<br>
an analysis unit 10 is then forwarded to a quality of service<br>
management unit 16, which is adapted to automatic quality of<br>
service class management. In particular, the quality of<br>
service management unit 16 determines and manages a quality<br>
of service class according to the identified quality of<br>
service class as forwarded by the bearer service analysis<br>
unit 10.<br><br></td>
