				<td>Process for preparation of high-purity meloxicam and meloxicam potassium salt<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of 4-hydroxy-2-methyl-N-(5-methyl-2-thiazolyl)-2H4,2-benzothiazine-3-carboxamide-l,l-dioxide of the Formula (II),<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
also known by the International Nonproprietary Name (INN) meloxicam and its potassium salt monohydrate of the Formula (I)<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
in high purity.<br>
TECHNICAL BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Meloxicam belongs to the group of non-steroidal antinflammatory drugs. It exerts its pharmacological effect by the inhibition of the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme system, which has significant role in the development of inflammatory processes. The medicinal importance of meloxicam resides in the fact that meloxicam selectively inhibits the COX-2 enzyme. This phenomenon results in less adverse effects during the medication period. It was found that the probability of the development of kidney-related or gastrointestinal adverse effects is significantly lower during the treatment-using meloxicam than in those cases, when different, non-selective COX-inhibitors were administered.<br>
Processes for the preparation of meloxicam have been disclosed in European Patent No. 2482. According to the first process, an activated form of 4-hydroxy-2-methyl-2H-l,2-benzothiazine-3-carboxylic acid of the Formula (III),<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
such as its methyl-, ethyl- or isopropyl ester (wherein the meaning of the R group in the Formula(III) is methyl, ethyl or isopropyl, respectively) is reacted with 2-amino-5-methyl-thiazole of the Formula (IV)<br>
 (Formula Removed)<br>
at high temperature. During this reaction, by-products with similar chemical structure to meloxicam and some tar are also formed, therefore further purification of the raw product is required. Solvents most often used for the recrystallization of raw meloxicam are dichloroethane and dichloromethane. The above mentioned process has the disadvantage that toxic and costly solvents are used, which are harmful to the environment as well. During the subsequent drying, it must be assured that the residual solvent concentration in the finished active ingredient should not exceed a threshold concentration set by 'health authorities and pharmacopoeias. At the drying temperature, thermal decomposition of the active ingredient also takes place. Use of halogenated organic solvents requires extensive analytical testing, because the residual solvent concentration must be determined in costly analytical measurements.<br>
In the second known process, the nitrogen atom of the 2H-1,2-benzothiazine ring is methylated using either the very expensive methyl jodide or the extremely toxic dimethyl sulfate. Due to its low yield and high production costs, this process is not used on an industrial scale.<br>
It was found that when using the above mentioned processes, the by-product 4-hydroxy-2-methyl-N-alkyl-(5-methyl-2-tibiazolyl)-2H-l,2-benzothiazine-3-carboxamide-l,l-dioxide of the Formula (V),<br>
 (Formula Removed)<br>
wherein the alkyl group corresponds identical to the R group in the starting compound of the Formula (III), i.e. methyl, ethyl or isopropyl, is formed in an amount of 1-20 % by weight Compounds of the Formula (V) are crystalline compounds poorly soluble in organic solvents and having their melting point above 250 °C. Impurities of the Formula (V) can be removed partly by filtering the hot solution of meloxicam crude product. However, a dissolved portion of the compounds of Formula (V) amounting to a few tenth percent crystallizes together with meloxicam upon cooling, therefore compounds of the Formula (V) appear in the final<br>
pharmaceutical active ingredient as impurity. It was observed that the compounds of the Formula (V) are produced in the largest quantity (10-20 % by weight), if the compound of the Formula (III) is used as starling material wherein R is methyl. The smallest amount of the compound of Formula (V) is produced in the case when R is isopropyl in the starting compound of the Formula (III). According to the specifications of the pharmacopoeias, threshold concentration of the compounds of the Formula (V) is 0.1 % by weight, which could be achieved only after recrystallizing the crude product several times from dichloromethane.<br>
United States Patent Application No. 20030109701 discloses processes for the preparation of several meloxicam polymorph forms by dissolving meloxicam in sodium-hydroxide solution prepared hi water or in the mixture of water and an organic solvent, subsequently acidifying the solution of meloxicam sodium salt, thus setting meloxicam free from its sodium salt. In this way, different crystalline modifications of meloxicam are obtained, depending upon the conditions used during dissolution and precipitation. Subsequently, the polymorph form obtained in the above described process is converted into the pharmaceutically acceptable polymorph I form.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Organic acids and phenols form salt with metals, which are usually well soluble in water. This phenomenon is often exploited for the purification of said compounds by dissolving the product in alkaline-aqueous medium and removing the alkaline- and water-insoluble organic impurities by filtration or extraction with a suitable non-miscible solvent.<br>
It is known according to the state of the art that potassium salts crystallize less easily and have greater solubility in water and in organic solvents, than sodium salts. Potassium salts can be hygroscopic, therefore said salts are preferably isolated from their solution in organic solvents.<br>
The preparation of sodium salt of meloxicam was disclosed in Example 2 of European Patent No. 2482. The methanolic solution of meloxicam is mixed with approximately equimolar amount of sodium methylate, the reaction mixture is evaporated to dryness, the sodium salt is suspended in the mixture of acetone-ether and filtered.<br>
United States Patent Application No. 20030109701 discloses the preparation of meloxicam sodium salt by dissolving meloxicam in aqueous-organic solution of sodium hydroxide.<br>
Although according to the state of the art, among alkaline metal salts of meloxicam, the potassium salt is also mentioned, no<br>
disclosure is available for the preparation of the potassium salt of meloxicam in solid form and no data can be found with regard to its stability, solubility and purity. According to the state of .the art, salts prepared from, meloxicam and inorganic or organic bases are prepared exclusively with the purpose to increase the solubility of meloxicam.<br>
According to the state of the art, there is no disclosure for the preparation of meloxicam in high purity form or its purification via its salt formed an with inorganic or organic base.<br>
It has been found very surprisingly, that the meloxicam potassium salt of the Formula (I) can be isolated easily in especially pure monohydrate form from the solution of the raw product prepared with water or, if desired, with aqueous-organic solvents, even in the case when the impurity of the Formula (V) is present in the amount of approximately 20% by weight<br>
The advantage of the preparation of the potassium salt of the Formula (I) resides in the fact that hi this way impurities of the Formula (V) as well as other alkaline-insoluble contaminants can be completely and very easily removed from the raw product<br>
Despite of the fact that the compounds of Formula (V) contain an aromatic hydroxy group, they do not form salt with alkali metals, therefore they are insoluble in alkaline aqueous solution and can be removed from the solution of meloxicam potassium salt by<br>
filtration. The small amount of impurity present on the surface of the solid crystalline meloxicam potassium salt monohydrate of the Formula (II), including the traces of the compounds of Formula (V) can be removed by simple washing with an appropriate solvent, since meloxicam potassium salt monohydrate of the Formula (I) is practically insoluble in organic solvents, for example, in ethyl-acetate.<br>
According to a further aspect of the present invention, there is provided a process for me preparation of high purity, crystalline meloxicam potassium salt monohydrate of the Formula (I). In the first step, meloxicam is produced starting from the compound of the Formula (III), wherein the meaning of R is methyl, which is reacted with the compound of Formula (IV). In this process, a by-product of •the Formula (V), wherein the meaning of R is methyl, is produced hi an amount of 10-15 % by weight The raw product is dissolved in aqueous potassium hydroxide or potassium carbonate solution at the temperature of 50 to 60 °C, the impurities insoluble in the alkaline-aqueous solvent are removed by filtration or centrifugation, the clear solution is cooled and the crystalline, high purity meloxicam potassium salt monohydrate of the Formula (I) is isolated by filtration or centrifugation.<br>
According to a further aspect of the present invention, there is provided a process to transform meloxicam potassium salt monohydrate of the Formula (I) into high purity meloxicam. The meloxicam potassium salt monohydrate of the Formula (I) is<br>
dissolved in water or in a mixture of water and an organic solvent, the solution is filtered, the filtrate is acidified by aqueous acid solution and cooled. Subsequently the crystalline meloxicam is collected, washed and dried.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a process for the production of high purity meloxicam polymorf I form. The potassium salt of the Formula (I) is dissolved in water at a temperature between 50 and 60 °C, the aqueous solution is filtered, and the yellow solution is acidified until pH 6 using concentrated acid solution, the solution is cooled and the precipitated crystalline meloxicam polymorph I form is isolated by centrifugation or filtration.<br>
The advantage of the process according to the present invention residesin the fact that the only solvent used during the purification process is water, therefore it is not necessary to remove organic solvent residues from the product At the acidity (pH value) given above, the product is almost insoluble in water, therefore the yield is almost quantitative. During the above described process, heat stress of the product and thermal decomposition thereof is minimal, which allows the production of high purity product. The above described process does not involve hazardous chemicals, therefore it is advantageous from the environmental viewpoint The use of the above described process results in significant cost reduction as well.<br>
The above inventive concept according to our invention can be applied more generally. Among esters of the Formula (III), the methyl ester is the cheapest and is produced on the greatest scale. However, said methyl ester of the Formula (III), wherein R is methyl, has received but limited attention during the production of meloxicam, because of the fact that the by-product of the Formula (V), wherein R is methyl, is produced during the amidation reaction in a significant amount, about 10-15% by weight, which could not be removed by crystallization. Using the process according to the present invention, contaminated raw products containing Ihe above mentioned high amounts of the compound of the Formula (V), wherein R is methyl, can be purified. In this manner, it has become possible to use the cheaper methyl ester of the Formula (III), wherein R is methyl, instead of the isopropyl ester of Formula (III), wherein R is isopropyl.<br>
The preparation of the raw meloxicam of the Formula (D) is carried out according to state of the art by reacting an ester of the Formula (III), wherein R is methyl, ethyl or isopropyl and 2-amino-5-methyl-thiazole of the Formula (TV) in solvents having high boiling point, for example, in chloro-benzene, decaline or xylene, preferably, hi xylene. The reaction takes place at the boiling point of the reaction mixture, at the temperature between about 130 and about 170 °C. The reaction time is usually 12-24 hours. Besides the product meloxicam, the reaction mixture contains a significant amount of the compound of the Formula (V) corresponding to the starting compound of the Formula (III) with respect to the R group<br>
and tar-like substance as well. If desired, the reaction can be carried out in presence of activated carbon to decrease the amount of tar. During the reaction, meloxicam and the by-product of the Formula (V) crystallizes and precipitates from the reaction mixture, and can be removed by filtration together with activated carbon, if present<br>
The raw meloxicam, which may contain activated carbon as well, is dissolved in a 20-50-fold weight amount of aqueous potassium hydroxide solution at a temperature between 50 and 80 °C under stirring. If desired, the dissolution rate of meloxicam can be increased by adding about 3-5 volume% of low molecular weight alcohol, for example, methanol, ethanol or isopropanol. The volume of the potassium hydroxide solution is determined taking into account the quality and quantity of the low molecular weight alcohol.<br>
The aqueous-alkaline solvent dissolves meloxicam only. The compound of the Formula (V), which is insoluble in alkaline medium is filtered together with activated carbon, if present. The clear yellow filtrate is cooled while the precipitation of crystalline meloxicam potassium salt monohydrate of the Formula (I) takes place.<br>
Crystallization of meloxicam potassium salt monohydrate can be enhanced by salting-out To achieve salting-out effect, an amount of potassium hydroxide or potassium carbonate is added to the solution of meloxicam potassium salt as solid or as concentrated<br>
aqueous solution in excess to the equimolar amount required for salt formation. Total amount of potassium ions present in the solution according to the present invention can be between 1-10 molar equivalents, preferably 4-5 molar equivalents relative to the molar amount of meloxicam.<br>
The solid crystalline meloxicam potassium salt monohydrate of the Formula (I) is isolated, the impurities present on the surface of the crystals are washed away using cold water or an organic solvent or a mixture of thereof, for example, using ethylacetate, ethanol, methanol, isopropanol as organic solvent<br>
According to our observations, using the process of the present invention, meloxicam potassium salt monohydrate can be obtained in high purity even in the unfavourable case when the reaction mixture contained 15-20 % of the compound of the Formula (V) by weight.<br>
According to the present invention, there is provided a process for the preparation of meloxicam polymorph I form of the Formula (H) in high purity, which comprises dissolving meloxicam potassium salt monohydrate of the Formula (I) in water or in the mixture of water and 1-20 volume% of a low molecular weight alcohol at a temperature between 50 and 100 °C, preferably at a temperature between 60 and 70 °C. The solvent preferably comprises 2-5 volume% ethanol in water.<br>
The solution is filtered, and the clear yellow filtrate is acidified to pH 6 using a mineral or organic acid. For acidification, any mineral or organic acid, for example, hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid or' phosphoric acid, acetic acid, tartaric acid can be used. The crystalline meloxicam is filtered off and washed with water and ethanol.<br>
