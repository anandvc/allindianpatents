				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention concerns a device for the lateral mounting and dismounting of a<br>
compressor barrel of a turbocompressor into or out of a casing, which is vertically split, with<br>
the features of the introductory clause of Claim 1.<br>
Turbocompressors with a vertically split casing are used especially for high gas<br>
pressures. The mounting devices that are already known in practice for turbocompressors<br>
with horizontal connections use a guide, which ~ guided from the drive side into the casing of<br>
the turbocompressor -- maintains the complete compressor barrel in equilibrium in a<br>
horizontal position, while on the non-drive side there is axially sliding support relative to the<br>
base frame. The complete compressor barrel, which is supported in this way and consists of<br>
the inner core section with seals and the rotor supported in the bearings, is then axially<br>
mounted or dismounted.<br>
Another mounting device uses an existing crane for maintaining the equilibrium<br>
instead of the support described above. In this regard, a cable is placed around the<br>
compressor barrel and held by the crane. This requires repeated resetting of the position of<br>
the cable with the risk of damage.<br>
Both of the mounting devices described above presuppose that the complete<br>
compressor barrel is pulled. The above-described mounting devices cannot be used when the<br>
compressor barrel must be pulled incompletely, that is, without the drive-side bearing. In this<br>
case, the rotor is not supported on the drive side.<br>
The objective of the invention is to create a device for mounting and dismounting a<br>
compressor barrel, in which the rotor is not unilaterally supported on the drive side by the<br>
already dismounted radial ball bearing and the rotor must be maintained in equilibrium during<br>
the mounting and dismounting.<br>
In accordance with the invention, this objective is achieved in a device of this general<br>
type by the characterizing features of Claim 1. Advantageous modifications of the invention<br>
are objects of the dependent claims.<br><br>
With the aid of the supporting arm supported on the compressor casing and the<br>
supporting device connected with the bearing block, the compressor barrel can be maintained<br>
in equilibrium from one side, even if the rotor is not yet held or is no longer held on the other<br>
side in a radial ball bearing. This is advantageous especially when lateral guide rails for the<br>
mounting device cannot be mounted due to the horizontal position of the suction connection<br>
and the pressure connection on the compressor casing, and when, on the drive side of the<br>
turbocompressor, accessibility is limited by the structural design of the base forged onto the<br>
compressor casing.<br>
A specific embodiment of the invention is illustrated in the drawings and explained in<br>
greater detail below.<br>
-- Figure 1 shows a longitudinal section through a turbocompressor with a<br>
mounting/dismounting device.<br>
-- Figure 2 shows a side view of the turbocompressor shown in Figure 1.<br>
The drawings show a multistage turbocompressor with a vertically split casing 1 in a<br>
state in which the compressor barrel 2 is located outside the casing 1 immediately before<br>
mounting or immediately after dismounting.<br>
The casing 1 of the turbocompressor has a vertical joint 3 and is unilaterally closed by<br>
a forged base 4 on one side. The compressor drive (not shown) is provided on this side of the<br>
turbocompressor. The base 4 holds a bearing for supporting the rotor 9, which will be<br>
described later. The casing 1 has casing feet 5 by which it rests on a base frame 6. A suction<br>
connection 7 and a pressure connection 8 are connected to the casing 1. In the illustrated<br>
embodiment, the two connections 7, 8 are located in the horizontal center plane of the casing<br>
1. Depending on requirements, the two connections 7, 8 can also be arranged in the lower<br>
two thirds of the casing circumference in a position between the 2 o'clock position and the 10<br>
o'clock position.<br><br>
The compressor barrel 2 is shown as though it were already mounted for installation in<br>
the casing 1. It consists of a rotor 9 with a shaft and of impellers 10 mounted in a rotationally<br>
rigid way on the shaft. The rotor 9 is inserted in a stationary inner core section 11. This inner<br>
core section 11 consists of disks 12, which enclose the impellers 10 of the rotor 9 and define<br>
internal return channels between the impellers 10 and to the connections 7, 8. The individual<br>
disks 12 are horizontally split and bolted together. A cap 13 is bolted onto the first disk 12 of<br>
the compressor barrel 2. The compressor barrel 2 also comprises a bearing block 14 with<br>
bearings for supporting one end of the rotor 9.<br>
A supporting arm 15 is releasably connected on the side with the cap 13 of the<br>
compressor barrel 2 for mounting or dismounting. The supporting arm 15 extends above the<br>
compressor barrel 2 in its longitudinal direction and is dimensioned sufficiently long that it<br>
projects beyond the inner core section 11. A roller 16 is mounted at the free end of the<br>
supporting arm 15. The roller 16 can roll along a track 17 to a position 16'. The track 17 is<br>
installed on the casing 1 of the turbocompressor above the'suction connection 7 and the<br>
pressure connection 8. At the end of the track 17 that faces the supporting arm 15, a stop 18<br>
is provided on the casing 1 to prevent the roller 16 from rolling back over the edge of the<br>
casing 1. The supporting arm 15 supports the compressor barrel 2 in such a way that it can be<br>
axially displaced on the casing 1.<br>
A supporting device 19 is releasably connected with the bearing block 14 of the<br>
compressor barrel 2. The supporting device 19, which is shown in greater detail in Figure 2,<br>
consists of two obliquely set supports 20, which are joined by a crossbar 21. Below each<br>
support 20 of the supporting device 19, there is a guideway 22, which supports the supporting<br>
device 19 and allows it to be displaced in the longitudinal direction of the compressor barrel<br>
2.<br>
A hoist 23 is mounted on either side of the turbocompressor. The flexible traction<br>
mechanism 24 of the hoist 23 is releasably connected with the supporting arm 15 at one end<br>
and with the casing 1 at the other end.<br>
A tackle line 25 acts on the supporting device 19 for the purpose of dismounting. A<br>
cable 26 of this tackle line 25 is guided around a cable pulley 27 to a cable drive that is<br><br>
located outside the turbocompressor and is not shown in the drawings. The cable pulley 27 is<br>
rotatably supported in a hinged support 28 that is anchored on the base frame 6. The guidance<br>
of the cable 26 of the above-described tackle line 25 is selected in such a way that the<br>
segment of the cable 26 between the supporting device 19 and the deflection point of the<br>
cable around the cable pulley 27 lies in the longitudinal axis of the compressor barrel 2.<br>
To prepare for mounting or to complete the dismounting, the compressor barrel 2 is<br>
mounted on a V-block in order to guarantee reliable support of the compressor barrel 2 during<br>
the attachment or detachment of the supporting arm 15 and the supporting device 19. Before<br>
being mounted in the casing 1, the compressor barrel 2 is oriented in such a way that its<br>
longitudinal axis comes into alignment with the extension of the longitudinal axis of the<br>
casing 1, that the end of the rotor 9 that faces away from the supporting arm 15 extends into<br>
the casing 1, and that the roller 16 sits on the track 17 on the casing 1 behind the stop 18. The<br>
supporting arm 15 and the supporting device 19 with the compressor barrel 2 are axially<br>
displaced by operation of the hoists 23 until the compressor barrel 2 occupies the intended<br>
position in the casing 1. During the insertion of the compressor barrel 2 into the casing 1, a<br>
temporary guide 29 inside the base 4 of the casing 1 provides reliable support of the rotor 9.<br>
The temporary guide is later replaced by a bearing. During dismounting, the compressor<br>
barrel 2 is pulled out by means of the tackle line 25.<br><br>
