				<td>REFRIGERATING APPARATUS HAVING RECIPROCATING COMPRESSOR<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a refrigerating apparatus for performing a<br>
compressing operation on a refrigerant by a reciprocating compressor and, more<br>
particularly, to a refrigerating system having a reciprocating compressor that is<br>
capable of improving a lubricating performance by enhancing a lubricant used for<br>
a reciprocating compressor and thus enhancing a performance of a refrigerating<br>
apparatus. The expression 'refrigerating system' used in this specification means<br>
'refrigerating apparatus'.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
As chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), a refrigerant used for a refrigerator, an air-<br>
conditioner or the like, has been known as a source material damaging an ozone<br>
layer of the stratosphere, researches on a substitute refrigerant are being actively<br>
conducted.<br>
The substitute refrigerant for CFC/HCFC is desired to be environment-<br>
friendly as well as to have excellent thermodynamical and chemicophysical<br>
characteristics. That is, the substitute refrigerant should have a high energy<br>
efficiency, a zero ozone layer disintegration index, a low global warming index, no<br>
toxic character and incombustibility.<br>
There are a few refrigerants which have no toxicity and no combustibility<br>
and are not CFC among methane- based and ethane-based halocarbon<br>
compounds: R22, R23, R134a, R123, R124 and R125. Of them, R22, R123 and<br>
R124, which are HCFC, are under regulation, and in case of R23, even though<br>
it is a kind of HFC, its thermodynamical properly is not so good as to be utilized<br>
as a refrigerant.<br>
HFC pure refrigerants usable as a substitute remgerant among halocarbon<br>
are very limited. Thus, mixed refrigerants have been studied and developed as<br>
substitute refrigerants by mixing two or three pure materials at a suitable<br>
composition ratio to make up for shortcomings of the pure materials and thus<br>
obtain a good environment index.<br>
R134a, R152a or cyclopropane (RC270) can substitute R12 which has<br>
been widely used for the home-use refrigerators and automobile air-conditioners.<br>
An HFC mixed refrigerant such as R404A and R507 is being taken into account<br>
as a substitute refrigerant of R502 mainly used as a low temperature refrigerant.<br>
Meanwhile, HFC mixed refrigerants including R32 are considered as substitute<br>
refrigerants of R22 used for a heat pump and various air-conditioning devices.<br>
Researches are under way for those substitute refrigerants.<br>
The CFC includes R11 (trichloromonogluoromethane), R12<br>
(dichlorodifluoromethane), R113 and the like, of which R12 largely used as a<br>
refrigerant for a refrigerator is one of regulation-subject materials as being a<br>
source material causing an ozone layer reduction and generating a global<br>
warming effect. Thus, currently, R134a is put to a practical use as a substitute<br>
refrigerant of R12.<br>
As a representative example of HCF, R134a exhibits a zero ozone<br>
depletion potential, incombustibility and physical properties similar to R12, and<br>
is widely used as such.<br>
However, with all those advantages, R134a is hardly combined with<br>
refrigerant oil currently used for a refrigerating system of R12 due to its peculiar<br>
chemical and electrical properties. Therefore, a refrigerant oil suitable for the<br>
refrigerant R134a is in need of development. Especially, necessity of a refrigerant<br>
oil usable for a reciprocating compressor for compressing the refrigerant R134a<br>
comes to the front.<br>
Figure 1 shows a construction of a general refrigerating circuit.<br>
As shown in Figure 1, a currently used refrigerating circuit includes: an<br>
evaporator 2 for performing a cooling operation as a low temperature and low<br>
pressure liquid refrigerant is evaporated ; a compressor 4 for compressing the low<br>
temperature and low pressure gaseous refrigerant discharged from the<br>
evaporator 2 to a high temperature and high pressure gaseous refrigerant ; a<br>
condenser 6 for changing the high temperature and high pressure gaseous<br>
refrigerant discharged from the compressor 4 to a high temperature and high<br>
pressure liquid refrigerant ; and a capillary tube 8 for decompressing the<br>
refrigerant discharged from the condenser 6 so as to be easily evaporated and<br>
transferring it to the evaporator 2.<br>
The refrigerant used for the refrigerating system is R134a, and a<br>
refrigerant oil used for the compressor 4 needs to have such physical and<br>
chemical characteristics that it is well harmonized with the refrigerant R134a.<br>
That is, the refrigerant oil of the refrigerating system should have<br>
characteristics that it protects an oil film sufficiently even though the refrigerant<br>
is dissolved, it is sufficiently stable thermally and chemically so as not to react in<br>
spite of being in contact with a refrigerant or an organic material metal, etc. at a<br>
high temperature or at a low temperature, and it has a high level of thermal<br>
stability so as not to generate a carbon sludge or not to be oxidized at a high<br>
temperature part of the compressor.<br>
In order to satisfy those characteristics, characters of the lubricant, such as<br>
a kinematic viscosity, a pour point, a density, a total acid number, a water content<br>
or the like, work as critical factors.<br>
Therefore, if the refrigerant oil used for the refrigerating apparatus is not<br>
harmonized with the refrigerant, oil circulation is deteriorated to degrade a heat<br>
transfer performance of the refrigerating system and a lubrication performance,<br>
resulting in that frictional portions of each motional part are abraded and thus<br>
each part is damaged. Then, the performance of the refrigerating apparatus is<br>
deteriorated.<br>

MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Figure 1 illustrates the construction of a refrigerating circuit of a general<br>
refrigerating apparatus or system, and Figure 2 is a sectional view of the<br>
reciprocating compressor. 'Refrigerating system' and 'refrigerating apparatus'<br>
used in this specification are one and the same.<br>
The refrigerating circuit of the refrigerating system includes : an evaporator<br>
2 for performing a cooling operation as a low temperature and low pressure liquid<br>
refrigerant is evaporated ; a compressor 4 for compressing the low temperature<br>
and low pressure gaseous refrigerant discharged from the evaporator 2 to a high<br>
temperature and high pressure gaseous refrigerant ; a condenser 6 for changing<br>
the high temperature and high pressure gaseous refrigerant discharged from the<br>
compressor 4 to a high temperature and high pressure liquid refrigerant ; and a<br>
capillary tube 8 for decompressing the refrigerant discharged from the condenser<br>
6 so as to be easily evaporated and transferring it to the evaporator.<br>
The refrigerating system includes a controller (not shown) which<br>
determines an output value according to a phase difference between a current<br>
and a voltage in order to vary a capacity of the compressor depending on an<br>
ambient temperature and environment.<br>
The evaporator 2 is a fin-tube type evaporator with an L-cord type heater<br>
(not shown) mounted at its lower portion. The L-cord type heater has a structure<br>
that a heating wire is coated with a silicon material and a coating material made<br>
of aluminum is coated at its outer circumferential surface.<br>
As shown in Figure 2, the compressor 4 includes: a hermetic container 24.<br>
to which a suction "pipe 20 for sucking a refrigerant and a discharge pipe 22 for<br>
discharging a compressed refrigerant; a driving unit 26 disposed inside the<br>
hermetic container 24 and generating a reciprocal motional force; a compression<br>
unit 28 for performing a compressing operation on the refrigerant upon receiving<br>
a reciprocal motional force generated from the driving unit 26; and a lubrication<br>
unit 30 for performing a lubrication operation on each motional portion of the<br>
driving unit 26 and the compression unit 28.<br>
The driving unit 26 consists of a stator 32 fixed inside the hermetic<br>
container 24, and a mover 34 disposed spaced apart from the stator 32 and<br>
linearly and reciprocally moved by an interaction with the stator 32 when power<br>
is applied to the stator 32.<br>
The stator 32 includes a cylindrical outer stator 38 fixed by a support frame<br>
36 fixed inside the hermetic container 24, an inner stator 40 disposed with a<br>
certain air gap with an inner circumferential surface of the outer stator 38, and a<br>
winding coil 42 wound inside the outer stator 38 to which power is applied from<br>
an external source.<br>
The mover 34 includes a magnet 46 disposed with a certain space<br>
between the outer stator 38 and the inner stator 40 and linearly and reciprocally<br>
moved when power is applied to the winding coil 42, and a magnet holder 48<br>
having magnets 46 mounted at equal intervals at its an outer circumferential<br>
surface and being connected to a piston 50 of the compression unit 28.<br>
The compression unit 28 includes a piston 50 connected to the magnet<br>
holder 48 and linearly and reciprocally moved; a cylinder 54 into which the piston<br>
50 is slidably inserted to form a certain compression chamber 36; a suction valve<br>
58 mounted at a refrigerant passage 56 formed at the piston 50 and preventing<br>
a backflow of the refrigerant after being introduced into the compression chamber<br>
52; and a discharge valve 60 mounted at the front side of the cylinder 54 and<br>
performing an opening and closing operation on a compressed refrigerant.<br>
The lubrication unit 30 includes a lubricant 62 filled with a certain amount<br>
at the lower portion of the hermetic container 24; a lubricant pumping unit 68 for<br>
pumping the lubricant 62; and a lubricant supply passage 64 for supplying the<br>
lubricant 62 pumped by the lubricant pumping unit 68 to a frictional portion<br>
between the piston 50 and the cylinder 54.<br>
When the compressor 4 is driven, the low temperature and low pressure<br>
gaseous refrigerant is compressed to a high temperature and high pressure<br>
gaseous refrigerant, which is then introduced into the condenser 6 and changed<br>
to a liquid refrigerant. The liquid refrigerant discharged from the condenser is<br>
decompressed while passing through the capillary tube 8 and then transferred to<br>
the evaporator 2. At this time, air is cooled while passing through the evaporator<br>
2 and supplied into the refrigerating system, thereby performing a cooling<br>
operation therein.<br>
The operation of the reciprocating compressor will now be described in<br>
detail.<br>
When power is applied to the winding coil 42, a flux is formed around the<br>
winding coil 42, forming a closed loop along the outer stator 38 and the inner<br>
stator 40. By the interaction of the flux formed between the outer stator 38 and the<br>
inner stator 40 and the flux formed by the magnet 46, the magnet 46 is linearly<br>
moved in an axial direction. When the direction of a current applied to the winding<br>
coil 42 is changed in turn, the magnet 46 is linearly and reciprocally moved as the<br>
direction of the flux of the winding coil 42 is changed.<br>
Then, the motion of the magnet 46 is transferred to the piston 50 by the<br>
magnet holder 48, and accordingly, the piston 50 is linearly and reciprocally<br>
moved inside the cylinder 54, thereby performing a compressing operation on the<br>
refrigerant.<br>
That is, when the piston 50 is retreated, the refrigerant introduced into the<br>
suction pipe 20 is supplied to the compression chamber 52 through the suction<br>
passage 56 formed at the piston 50. Meanwhile, when the piston 50 advances,<br>
the suction passage 56 is closed by the suction valve 58, the refrigerant inside the<br>
compression chamber 52 is compressed, and the compressed refrigerant is<br>
externally discharged through the discharge pipe 22<br>
During the compressing operation, the lubricant 62 filled in the hermetic<br>
container 24 is pumped according to operation of the lubricant pumping unit 68<br>
and supplied to the frictional portion between the piston 50 and the cylinder 54<br>
through the lubricant supply passage 64, for a lubricating operation.<br>
As the refrigerant compressed by the reciprocating compressor constructed<br>
and operated as described above, the HFC refrigerant, hydrogenated carbon<br>
fluoride comprising hydrogen, fluorine and carbon without chlorine, is mainly used<br>
as having a high energy efficiency and a zero ODP (ozone depletion potential),<br>
is incombustible, and has a low global warming index, no toxicity and<br>
incombustibility.<br>
Specifically, R32, R143a and R152a, etc. are used as the HFC refrigerant,<br>
of which HFC134a is preferably used for the current refrigerator as it has a purity<br>
of above 99.9%, a molecular formula CF3CFH2 and a molecular weight of 102.<br>
As the lubricant of the reciprocating compressor for which the HFC34a<br>
refrigerant is used, an ester-based lubricant, a sort of synthetic fluid, is used as<br>
it has a good compatibility with the refrigerant and satisfies physical and chemical<br>
characteristics.<br>
The density of the ester-based lubricant is preferably 0.93~0.99 g/cm3 at<br>
a temperature of 15°C.<br>
Preferably, a total acid number of the ester-based lubricant is adopted by<br>
below 0.01 mgKOH/g.<br>
The total acid number of the lubricant, representing an amount of an acid<br>
component contained in an oil, indicates an amount of potassium hydroxide<br>
required for neutralizing an acid component contained in 1g of sample oil by the<br>
number of mg. Since the lubricant used for the refrigerator should be absolutely<br>
neutral, the total acid number works as a basis for determining a deterioration<br>
level of the refrigerant oil.<br>
A flash point of the ester-based lubricant varies depending on a size and<br>
a type of the reciprocating compressor. Preferably, it is below 240°C, and it can<br>
be below 165°C, below 175°C, below 185°C and below 200°C according to the<br>
type of an adopted compressor.<br>
A kinematic viscosity (cSt) of the ester-based lubricant is preferably<br>
10.0~22.5 mm2/s at a temperature of 40°C.<br>
A saturated water amount of the ester-based lubricant is preferably<br>
1500~2000 PPM. The moisture contained in the lubricant should be maintained<br>
by below a suitable level because it causes freezing, sludge generation and<br>
corrosion.<br>
A breakdown voltage of the ester-based lubricant is preferably above<br>
30KV.<br>
As so far described, the refrigerating system having a reciprocating<br>
compressor of the present invention has such an advantage that since it uses the<br>
ester-based lubricant, a sort of a synthetic fluid, with an excellent compatibility with<br>
the HFC refrigerant, hydrogenated carbon fluoride comprising hydrogen, fluorine<br>
and carbon without chlorine, the lubricating performance is improved, a life span<br>
of the reciprocating compressor is lengthened and a performance of the<br>
refrigerating system can be enhanced.<br>
It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and<br>
variations can be made in the refrigerating system having a reciprocating<br>
compressor of the present invention without departing from the spirit or scope of<br>
the invention. Thus, it is intended that the present invention cover modifications<br>
and variations of this invention provided they come within the scope of the<br>
appended claims and their equivalents.<br><br>
