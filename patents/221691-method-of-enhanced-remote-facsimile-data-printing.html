				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates in general to the printing technology. Further this invention relates to facsimile printing wherein the user can use different printing technologies to print the facsimile data in different formats. More particularly, this invention relates to a method of enhanced remote facsimile data printing.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
in the current market, high resolution scanners and high quaiity printers are availabie. But MFP devices which have very good scanning capabilities do not have very good quality of fax printing. Most of the current MFPs (multi function peripherals) / fax devices do not have the capability to print the received fax with the quality which the user desires.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates the regular Fax transmission. One user has MFP which can scan the document at very good quality other has the fax machine which cannot print the received fax at the same good quality in which the document was scanned and sent. In this case we need to take the soft copy of the received fax and then print using available high resolution printers.<br>
The fax transmission and reception has been illustrated in the figures 2 and 3 wherein if the machine capability does not match, then the transmitting machine will change the format of the facsimile data so that the machine at the receiving end can receive the data and print it. In this scenario, if the user wants to send the data in JBIG format (bi-level Compression technique) and if the receiving device does not support JBIG decompression, then the user cannot send the data in JBIG format. The Sender has to switch over to a format that is supported by the receiver.<br>
Fig 3 is a flow chart which illustrates a scenario where machine capability does not match. First the scanned document is encoded in a selected format. The machine compatibility is checked and exchanged in the handshake. The sender then checks whether the request capability is supported. If supported the fax is send and print is<br><br>
taken. If the machine capability does not match, then the transmitting machine will change the format of the facsimile data so that the machine at the receiving end can receive the data and print it.<br>
LIMITATIONS<br>
The existing facsimile data printing has the following limitations;<br>
1.	Receiving end Fax/MFP device does not have the capability to accept every kind of file format.<br>
2.	If the scanned document is of very high resolution, but the printer is not capable of printing it at that resolution, then facsimile print quality will be poor.<br>
3.	If the user sends the scanned data in color but the receiving end MFP/Fax device does not have color printing capability then it would print ]n monochrome.<br>
4.	In the market, if there is some new printing technology, then user cannot use it<br>
unless he changes the printing hardware to effect printing of the received fax in<br>
that new format.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The primary object of the invention is to invent a method for enhanced remote fax<br>
printing.<br>
It is another object of the invention to enable the user to use any kind of printing technology available to print the facsimile data whereby the capability for remote facsimile printing is enhanced.<br>
It is another object of the invention to enable the user to use any of the data formats including JBIG, PDF, MMR, etc. supported by the print server for facsimile printing.<br>
It is another object of the invention to enable the end user to choose the driver to be used at print server to print the fax e.g. if incoming fax is PDF encoded, then it can print<br><br>
that fax using PDF printer Driver.<br>
It is another object of the invention to enable the user to print remote fax at high quality at low cost and without upgrading his MFP device hardware.<br>
It is another object of the invention to enable MFP machine to print any kind of Email received from the remote MFP machine where the MFP machine which support Email Printing.<br>
It is another object of the invention that copier devices can also use this method to print high quality scanned image to a printer.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method of enhanced remote fax printing which supports MFP/fax devices which do not have the capability to print received fax at high quality. This method will help existing or future MFP devices to utilize the features provided by the printer devices. Copier devices can also use this method to print high quality scanned image to a printer. This invention will help the user to print fax at high quality at low cost.<br>
For example, if the MFP device has the capability to scan in color but does not have color printing capability, then color copy can be printed by implementation of this method. The receiving end user can print fax with high qualityjf high quality printer is available at the receiving end.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention comprises a method of enhanced remote facsimile data printing, comprising the steps of:<br>
(a)	scanning the data to be transmitted by the sender;<br>
(b)	exchanging details of capabilities including format and resolution of the data by the sender and receiver before starting the fax transmission;<br><br>
(c)	checking the print server for the capability of decoding and printing the received data;<br>
(d)	communicating with print server by the receiver to print the facsimile data in the format in which sender is sending;<br>
(e)	routing the facsimile data to the alternate printer device to print the facsimile data at proposed format and resolution, if the receiver is not capable of printing the facsimile data; and<br>
(f)	communicating to the sending MFP device by receiving MFP device about the print server"s capability of decoding and printing the received data.<br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the ensuing detailed description of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
The present invention relates to a method for printing a received fax with a printer which has the capability to print documents at high quality. Depending on the quality of received scanned data MFP device will decide whether to print the received data with MFP printer or with any other printer having capability to print at high quality. For e.g. the MFP device at the sender end scans the data at 1200 dpi and sends a fax. At the receiving end if MFP device is not able to print received fax at good quality then the data is routed to an alternative printer device which will print it at high quality.<br>
In order to print the remote Fax the MFP devices should support Non Standard Capability exchange communication. That means if receiving MFP device is not capable of printing a received fax at high quality then it should communicate to the sender that it has the capability to print this document through other printer device.<br>
Figure 4 illustrates a typical set up for printing remote fax with high quality printer. This comprises a print server which will take the request from the MFP device to print a received fax, through printer driver installed in the Print Server.<br>
Figure 5 illustrates the printing sequence involved in printing fax with high quality<br><br>
printer.<br>
If there is some capabiiity mismatch i.e. if the receiver is not capable of receiving the fax in the format in which sender is sending then the receiver wiii communicate with print server. If the print server is capable of decoding and printing the received data then receiving device will communicate to the sending device through Non-standard fax frame conveying that it can receive the facsimile data.<br>
Figure 6 shows the flowchart for enhanced fax data printing wherein the capability of the receiving end is checked and the format is changed if required before data is sent. First the scanned document is encoded in a selected format. The machine compatibility is checked and exchanged in the handshake. The sender then checks whether the request capability is supported. If supported the fax is send via the print server and the print is taken. If request capability not supported, print server is communicated and checked for its capability of decoding and printing the received data. Ifprint server is capable of decoding, the fax is sent via the print server and print is taken. If print server cannot decode the received data, the information is converted to a format supported by the receiver and print is taken.<br>
Referring to Figure 7, the enhanced fax printing architecture comprises print servers which will take the request from the MFP device to print a received fax, through printer driver installed in Print Servers which renders the job using the high quality printer device for fax/copier printing. In this method a processor module needs to be added in print server which will take the request from MFP device, process the request and send the response to MFP device. This processor module vi"Ill have the information about the print server capability such as file format supported, color/monochrome printer attached, and resolution supported. When this processor module receives the data from MFP device it analyzes the data, selects the appropriate printer driver for printing and forwards the data to high quality printer.<br>
Figure 8 shows requirement in the print server. The print server consists of a database for the information about printer attached to the print server, software component or<br><br>
processor module to process the MFP request and to send response to MFP and component to handle fax/copy data.<br>
OPERATION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Before starting the fax transmission, sender and receiver exchange their capabilities i.e. format and resolution in which the sender is going to send the fax data, in the existing structure if there is some mismatch in the capabilities of sender and receiver, then sender will try to send the facsimile data in the format in which the receiver can receive. But in the proposed method if there is some capability mismatch i.e. if the receiver is not capable of receiving the fax in the format in which sender is sending then receiver will communicate with print server. If the print server is capable of decoding and printing the received data then receiving MFP device will communicate to the sending MFP device through Non-standard fax frame conveying that it can receive the proposed facsimile data.<br>
Figure 9 describes the overall architecture for fax printing at different printing devices. These printing devices are specifically meant for printing a document at very good quality by using different print technology. For example after scanning a document, Fax/MFP device starts communicating with receiving end fax/MFP device. If the sender machine sends data at very high resolution then receiving fax machine will communicate to the sender machine that its printer does not support this high resolution but can print this in some other printer with the help of print server. This can be achieved by using Non-standard frames if required. After receiving the fax, MFP device communicates with print sen/er to print the received fax. MFP and Print Server can communicate through any file transfer protocol. Once theprint server receives the data, it will use printer driver to print the fax with the chosen printer.<br>
