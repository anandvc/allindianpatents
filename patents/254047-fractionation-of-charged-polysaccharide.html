				<td>FRACTIONATION OF CHARGED POLYSACCHARIDE<br>
The present invention relates to fractionation of polydisperse and<br>
charged polysaccharides optionally having reactive groups, into low<br>
polydispersity fractions (preferably pd 
polysaccharides are useful for conjugation to substrates such as peptides,<br>
proteins, drugs, drug delivery systems (e.g. liposomes), viruses, cells, (e.g.<br>
animal cells, microbes, synthetic polymers etc), or for use as excipients or<br>
diluents in pharmaceutical compositions.<br>
Polysialic acids (PSAs) are naturally occurring unbranched polymers<br>
of sialic acid, produced by certain bacterial strains and mammals in certain<br>
cells [Roth et. al., 1993]. PSAs can be produced in various degrees of<br>
polymerisation: from n = about 80 or more sialic acid residues down to n =<br>
2 by either limited acid hydrolysis, digestion with neuraminidases or by<br>
fractionation of the natural, bacterially or cell derived forms of the polymer.<br>
The composition of different PSAs also varies such that there are: I.<br>
homopolymeric forms i.e. the alpha-2,8-linked PSA comprising the capsular<br>
polysaccharide of E. co//strain K1 and of the group-B meningococci, which<br>
is also found on the embryonic form of the neuronal cell adhesion molecule<br>
(N-CAM). II. Heteropolymeric forms, such as the alternating alpha-2,8 alpha-<br>
2,9 PSA of £. co// strain K92 and the group C polysaccharides of N.<br>
meningitidis. In addition, III. alternating copolymers containing sialic acids<br>
monomers other than sialic acid such as group W135 or group Y of N.<br>
meningitidis. PSAs have important biological functions including the evasion<br>
of the immune and complement systems by pathogenic bacteria and the<br>
regulation of glial adhesiveness of immature neurons during foetal<br>
development (wherein the polymer has an anti-adhesive function)<br>
[Muhlenhoff et. al., 1998; Rutishauser, 1989; Troy, 1990,1992; Cho and<br>
Troy, 1994].There are no known receptors for PSAs in mammals. The alpha-<br>
2,8-linked PSA of E. co// strain K1 is also known as 'colominic acid' (CA) and<br>
is used (in various lengths) to exemplify the present invention.<br>
SUBSTITUTE SHEET (RULE 26)<br>
The alpha-2,8 linked form of PSA, among bacterial polysaccharides,<br>
is uniquely non-immunogenic (eliciting neither T-cell or antibody responses<br>
in mammalian subjects) even when conjugated to immunogenic carrier<br>
protein, which may reflect its existence as a mammalian (as well as a<br>
bacterial) polymer. Shorter forms of the polymer (up to n=4) are found on<br>
cell-surface gangliosides, which are widely distributed in the body, and are<br>
believed to effectively impose and maintain immunological tolerance to<br>
PSA. In recent years, the biological properties of PSAs, particularly those<br>
of the alpha-2,8 linked homopolymeric PSA, have been exploited to modify<br>
the pharmacokinetic properties of protein and low molecular weight drug<br>
molecules [Gregoriadis, 2001; Jain et. al., 2003; US-A-5846,951;<br>
WO-A-0187922]. PSA derivatisation of a number of therapeutic proteins<br>
including catalase and asparaginase [Fernandes and Gregoriadis, 1996<br>
and 1997] gives rise to dramatic improvements in circulating half-life, and<br>
also allows such proteins to be used in the face of pre-existing antibodies<br>
raised as an undesirable (and sometimes inevitable) consequence of prior<br>
exposure to the therapeutic protein [Fernandes and Gregoriadis, 2001]. In<br>
many respects, the modified properties of polysialylated proteins are<br>
comparable to proteins derivatised with polyethylene glycol (PEG). For<br>
example, in each case, half-lives are increased, and proteins and peptides<br>
are more stable to proteolytic digestion, but retention of biological activity<br>
appears to be greater with PSA than with PEG [Hreczuk-Hirst et. al., 2002].<br>
Also, there are questions about the use of PEG with therapeutic agents that<br>
have to be administered chronically, as PEG is only very slowly<br>
biodegradable [Beranovaet.al., 2000] and high molecular weight forms tend<br>
to accumulate in the tissues [Bendele, et. al., 1998; Convers, et. al., 1997].<br>
PEGylated proteins have been found to generate anti PEG antibodies that<br>
could also influence the residence time of the conjugate in the blood<br>
circulation [Cheng et. al., 1990]. Despite the established history of PEG as<br>
a parenterally administered polymer conjugated to therapeutics, a better<br>
understanding of its immunotoxicology, pharmacology and metabolism will<br>
be required [Hunter and Moghimi, 2002; Brocchini, 2003]. Likewise there<br>
are concerns about the utility of PEG in therapeutic agents that require high<br>
dosages, (and hence ultimately high dosages of PEG), since accumulation<br>
of PEG may lead to toxicity. The alpha 2,8 linked PSA therefore offers an<br>
attractive alternative to PEG, being an immunologically 'invisible'<br>
biodegradable polymer which is naturally part of the human body, and that<br>
can degrade, via tissue neuraminidases, to the non-toxic saccharide, sialic<br>
acid.<br>
Our group has described, in previous scientific papers and in granted<br>
patents, the utility of natural PSAs in improving the pharmacokinetic<br>
properties of protein therapeutics [Gregoriadis, 2001; Femandes and<br>
Gregoriadis, 1996, 1997, 2001; Gregoriadis et. al., 1993, 1998, 2000;<br>
Hreczuk-Hirst et. al., 2002; Mital, 2004; Jain et. al., 2003, 2004; US-A-<br>
05846,951; WO-A-0187922]. Now, we describe new derivatives of PSAs,<br>
which allow new compositions and methods of production of PSA-derivatised<br>
proteins (and other forms of therapeutic agents).<br>
Methods have been described previously for the attachment of<br>
polysaccharides to therapeutic agents such as proteins [Jennings and<br>
Lugowski, 1981; US-A-5846,951; WO-A-0187922J. Some of these methods<br>
depend upon chemical derivatisation of the 'non-reducing1 end of the<br>
polymer to create a protein-reactive aldehyde moiety (Fig. 1,2). The<br>
reducing end of PSA (and other polysaccharides) is only weakly reactive<br>
with proteins under the mild conditions necessary to preserve protein<br>
conformation and the chemical integrity of PSA during conjugation. The<br>
non-reducing end of the sialic acid terminal unit, which contains vicinal<br>
diols, can be readily (and selectively) oxidised with periodate to yield a<br>
mono-aldehyde derivative. This derivative is much more reactive towards<br>
proteins and comprises of a suitably reactive element for the attachment of<br>
proteins via reductive amination and other chemistries. We have described<br>
this previously in US-A-5846,951 and WO-A-0187922. The reaction is<br>
illustrated in Fig. 1a and 2 in which;<br>
1 a) shows the oxidation of CA (alpha-2,8 linked PSA from E. co/i)<br>
with sodium periodate to form a protein-reactive aldehyde at the nonreducing<br>
end of the terminal sialic acid and<br>
2) shows the selective reduction of the Schiff s base with sodium<br>
cyanoborohydride (NaCNBH3) to form a stable irreversible covalent bond<br>
with the protein amino group.<br>
The weak reactivity of the reducing end can be exploited to beneficial<br>
effect (by destroying the non-reducing end, capping the reducing end and<br>
derivatising with a bifunctional crosslinker), thus avoiding the product<br>
complexity described in Fig. 1b using the established method (Fig. 1a) of<br>
reductive amination of proteins with periodate oxidised CA.<br>
Commercially available polymers (especially natural polymers, e.g.<br>
colominic acid (CA); used in most of the above papers) are produced from<br>
bacteria and are highly polydisperse. They may also contain bacterial<br>
contaminants such as endotoxins, salts etc. Such materials might not be<br>
suitable for the production of PSA-derivatised therapeutic agents intended<br>
for use in humans and animals, where the chemical and molecular definition<br>
of drug entities is of major importance because of the safety requirements of<br>
medical ethics and of the regulatory authorities (e.g. FDA, EMEA).<br>
Therefore, we have solved the above problems by developing new<br>
methods for the fractionation of a polydisperse polysaccharide preparation<br>
into a series of low polydispersity (
species within a narrow range of molecular weights. These new preparations<br>
are particularly suitable for the production of PSA-derivatised therapeutic<br>
agents intended for use in humans and animals, where the chemical and<br>
molecular definition of drug entities (e.g. predictable half-life) is of major<br>
importance because of the safety requirements of medical ethics and of the<br>
regulatory authorities (e.g. FDA, EMEA).<br>
Ion exchange chromatography methods are well known in the art for<br>
separation of complex mixtures. In general the prior art uses variation in<br>
ionic strength to achieve this separation. In a solution of fully dissaciated<br>
electrolytes the ionic strength (I) is defined as 1=0.5 E, C, Zj2, in which Cj is<br>
the concentration of a particular ion, and Zj is the charge number of the ionic<br>
species.<br>
Constantino et. al., [1999] have reported a chromatographic method<br>
suitable for the isolation of the high molecular weight fraction from a<br>
polydisperse preparation of a negatively charged polysaccharide such as the<br>
Haemophilus influenzae type b and Neisseria meningitidis group A and group<br>
C antigens. The material obtained still contains species with a large range of<br>
molecular weights (i.e. it is still highly polydisperse) but it is free from small<br>
oligosaccharides. The removal of the oligosaccharides makes this material<br>
more suitable for use in polysaccaride based vaccines. The removal of the<br>
low molecular weight species was accomplished, using a two step elution<br>
process. Briefly Hib (Haemophilus influenzae type b antigen), a negatively<br>
charged polysaccharide, was bound to an ion exchange resin and the low<br>
molecular weight species where eluted by extensive washing with a low ionic<br>
strength buffer. The intermediate and high molecular weight species, which<br>
remain bound in the column were recovered by eluting with a high ionic<br>
strength buffer.<br>
Zhang et al (1997) have reported use of high performance ion<br>
exchange chromatography for the separation of colominic acid polymers.<br>
Three stock solutions are mixed together to form a linear gradient which has<br>
a progressively higher concentration of sodium nitrate.<br>
The present invention may be distinguished over the disclosures of<br>
Constantino et al and Zhang et al by its use of a step rather than a linear<br>
gradient elution. Constantino et al use a large volume of low ionic strength<br>
wash to remove all low molecular weight species from the column and then a<br>
high volume high ionic strength wash to remove all other species from the<br>
column. This does not result in separation into low polydispersity fractions.<br>
The use of a step gradient according to the present invention, with steps that<br>
differ only slightly in ionic strength, leads to the isolation of low<br>
polydispersity fractions.<br>
Ravenscroft et. al., [1999] have developed a procedure for the<br>
molecular weight determination of low molecular weight Hib<br>
oligosaccharides using ion exchange chromatography (IEC). Ion exchange<br>
affords excellent resolution of small oligosaccharides with DP (degree of<br>
polymerisation) values of 10 or lower. This was exploited to separate a<br>
mixture of oligomers using ion exchange into individual oligomers. The DP<br>
was measured with mass-spectroscopy and the purified oligosaccarides<br>
were then used as standards to calibrate an ion exchange column enabling<br>
thus the determination of the molecular weight of small oligosaccharides to<br>
be carried out using analytical ion exchange.<br>
The present invention generates fractions of polysaccharides of low<br>
polydispersity in good yield which may be used to provide pharmaceutically<br>
useful protein-polymer conjugates. None of the prior art describe techniques<br>
which fractionate polysaccharides in this manner.<br>
According to the invention there is provided a process for separating<br>
polydisperse ionically charged polysaccharide into fractions of different<br>
average molecular weight in which an aqueous solution of the polydisperse<br>
polysaccharides is contacted with ion exchange resin in a column, the<br>
polysaccharides are then subjected to selective elution by aqueous elution<br>
buffer, and polysaccharide is recovered from eluted fractions, characterised<br>
in that the selective elution involves washing the resin in the column<br>
sequentially with at least three elution buffers each having different and<br>
constant ionic strength and/or pH and in which the second and subsequent<br>
buffers have higher ionic strength and/or pH than the buffers of the<br>
immediately preceding step.<br>
In the process, preferably the elution buffers all have the same pH,<br>
but have successively higher ionic strength due to increasing concentrations<br>
of ions such as ions of salts of strong mineral acids and strong mineral<br>
bases. Preferably the salt is sodium chloride. Preferably the increase in<br>
ionic strength is the same as that produced by increasing the NaCI<br>
concentration by 5-100 mM, preferably 25 mM. This corresponds to an<br>
increase in ionic strength of 0.005 to 0.1 M, preferably'0.025M.<br>
Alternatively, the elution buffers may have successively higher pH<br>
values. Preferably, the difference between the pH of each eluent is the<br>
same and preferably 0.2 pH units. The pH of each buffer preferably lies in<br>
the range 7.4-13. Typically, the first elution buffer will have a pH of around<br>
7.4 and at least 5 elution steps will be used in the process. Ideally, the ionic<br>
strength of all elution buffers will be less than 25M. The concentration of<br>
hydrogen and hydrpxyl ions in the buffers is so low that their contribution to<br>
the total ionic strength of the solution is negligible.<br>
An increase in ionic strength and pH may be used in tandem in the<br>
fractionation process. Alternatively, pH elution may be used initially in a<br>
series of steps to raise the pH from 7.4 to at least 8.8, and then ionic<br>
strength elution may begin. As an alternative, increasing the pH after a<br>
short salt gradient may be performed, but this requires a starting pH of<br>
greater than 7.4. A low pH range (around 4) may allow fractionation when<br>
using a strong ion exchange column. However, since many polysaccharides<br>
are not stable at this pH, the pH of the eluted fractions should in this case<br>
immediately be adjusted to around 7.4.<br>
Preferably, the elution buffers contain a base, which is preferably<br>
triethonolamine.<br>
It is possible for there to be an initial washing step, in which a low<br>
ionic concentration elution buffer is washed through the column. For<br>
instance such an initial wash step may be carried out with a buffer having a<br>
salt concentration more than 100 mM lower in salt concentration than the<br>
first of the essential three elution buffers used in the process. Such an initial<br>
step may wash out low molecular weight contaminants or other contaminants<br>
which are by-products from recovery processes for naturally occurring<br>
materials. Such an initial wash step may involve a volume of at least 1,<br>
preferably at least 1.5 column volumes, based on the volume of the ion<br>
exchange resin column. It is to be noted that a column of ion exchange resin<br>
may have a diameter of the cross-section which is greater than the height or<br>
may, as in a conventional column, have a height which is greater than the<br>
diameter of the cross section. The volume may be in the range 1 to 5000<br>
ml. The height of the column may be in the range 1 cm to.5000 cm. The<br>
cross sectional area may be in the range 1 cm to 5000 cm2. The cross<br>
section may be of any shape but is preferably round.<br>
We have found that it is preferred for each of the essential elution<br>
steps to use at least 1.0, preferably at least 1.25 and most preferably at least<br>
1.5 column volumes of the respective elution buffer. Preferably no more<br>
than 3 column volumes of elution buffer are used. The flow rate for a 75ml<br>
matrix is preferably 7ml/minute.<br>
The process of the invention preferably comprises at least 5, for<br>
instance as many as 20 or, generally in the range 6 to 12, sequential steps<br>
of elution with the elution buffers of successively increasing ionic strength.<br>
The ionic strength in the first of these essential steps is generally in the<br>
range 1mM to 1M. Weaker ionic concentrations will be required for stronger<br>
counterions, such as sulphate, than for chloride.<br>
Preferably the ionic strength of an elution buffer is varied by varying<br>
the level of a salt of a strong mineral acid and a strong mineral base,<br>
preferably sodium chloride.<br>
With regard to the recovery steps, these generally involve steps in<br>
which the polysaccharide is isolated from the salt, for instance using<br>
membranes, for instance ultra-filtration membranes. Such steps may allow<br>
concentration of the polysaccharides to form more highly concentrated<br>
solutions. Such solutions may be subjected to additional steps of membrane<br>
treatment, for instance successive ultra-filtration or other filtration steps.<br>
The elution buffer may contain a volatile acid or base and in this case the<br>
recovery involves volatilisation of the volatile acid or base from the eluted<br>
fractions. Although it is possible to recover the polysaccharide from<br>
aqueous solutions by precipitation techniques, for instance involving non<br>
solvents for the polysaccharides, it is preferred that no such solvents are<br>
utilised, since this may make final isolation from the respective solvents<br>
more difficult. Consequently the final step of recovery preferably involves<br>
evaporation of the water and, preferably, any remaining volatile buffer<br>
components remaining from the elution steps. In a preferred case wherein<br>
triethanolamine is present, both the triethanolamine cation and acetate anion<br>
are volatile and can easily be removed under vacuum.<br>
The polysaccharide may be finally isolated from solution by drying,<br>
preferably under reduced pressure. This is preferably performed by freezedrying.<br>
Precipitation, preferably using a non solvent, may be carried out as a<br>
preliminary step to fractionation to remove a portion of the population and<br>
decrease polydispersity of the higher molecular weight fractions. Preferably,<br>
differential ethanol precipitation is used.<br>
The invention described herein is the use of a step gradient strategy,<br>
which affords the stepwise removal (and subsequent collection) of<br>
progressively higher molecular weight species from a polydisperse polymer<br>
population bound to an ion exchange resin. The ion exchange resin may be<br>
any strong or weak anion or cation exchange medium. Using a wash of any<br>
given ionic strength will elute a complex population of species from the<br>
column. By using a series of short washes in tandem, each step elutes a part<br>
of the population that would be eluted by the next step, so at each point only<br>
a small population is actually eluted, facilitating the fractionation of the<br>
polydisperse preparations into fractions with narrow polydispersity. This<br>
process may also facilitate removal of impurities e.g.salt, endotoxin etc.<br>
In IEC, molecules do not remain absolutely motionless at low salt<br>
concentrations. They move extremely slowly as bands. Their speed depends<br>
upon the binding constant of a molecule to the column, which varies with the<br>
ionic strength. When the binding constant is, for example, medium, a band<br>
will move relatively slowly through the column and broaden to some extent.<br>
When the binding constant is weak the band will move very quickly but with<br>
negligible broadening. When the binding constant is strong the band will<br>
move very slowly, mostly by broadening. A linear gradient prevents the<br>
broadening, giving narrow bands and well-defined peaks. A step gradient on<br>
the other hand elutes the molecules which at the particular<br>
concentration have a low binding constant as a tight band and elutes those<br>
which have an intermediate binding constant as a diffuse band (which is<br>
likely to carry over into the next fraction). Molecules which have a high<br>
binding constant will exhibit little movement and they will mostly be broad.<br>
The result is that each step produces a peak that rises very rapidly and then<br>
slowly declines producing a tail. Step gradients are well documented to<br>
behave in this manner. The rise of the peak contains more of the species<br>
with a low binding constant and the tail contains more of the species with the<br>
intermediate binding constant (which will also carry over to the next fraction).<br>
The longer each step runs for, the more it causes the species which have an<br>
intermediate binding constant to broaden and eventually some are eluted,<br>
enriching what is left in the column of higher species. So a step gradient also<br>
elutes species, which in a linear gradient would come down at higher ionic<br>
strength and cause some shifting of even the much higher bands. Although<br>
this does not facilitate resolution, it is advantageous to fractionation. If two<br>
species have a very close binding constant a step gradient can afford<br>
purification or enrichment of the species with the higher binding constant.<br>
The first step elutes both species, but preferentially the one with the lower<br>
binding constant more, The second step elutes both species but since most<br>
of the low binding constant species has already been removed in the<br>
previous step, most of the fraction is the high binding constant species. So a<br>
step gradient, though it cannot completely separate species with similar<br>
binding constants, can result in significant enrichment of the one with the<br>
higher binding constant.<br>
Taking CA as an example, the binding constant is the result of the<br>
average charge on the molecule. The difference in binding constants<br>
depends on the charge difference between different species. The charge<br>
ratio between a species with 41 charges and a species with 40 charges is a<br>
lot lower than that between a species with 11 charges and one with 10<br>
charges. As the amount of charges (and hence) monomers increases the<br>
difference between the binding constants decreases. At larger molecular<br>
weights it becomes practically negligible.<br>
A linear gradient therefore results in good resolution for the low<br>
molecular weight species, but as the molecular weight (and hence the<br>
charge) increases, resolution decreases. The step gradient strategy, in<br>
contrast, elutes more of the lower than higher molecular weight species with<br>
each wash. Thus the step gradient produces less disperse fractions towards<br>
the higher end of the molecular weight range and more disperse fractions in<br>
the middle and begining of the range.<br>
Several parameters may affect the separation.<br>
1) pH: The charge on the polymer is pH dependent; decreasing the<br>
pH will reduce the charge and might afford better resolution on the higher<br>
end of the molecular weight range.<br>
2) Step wash volume: The more washing the less of the higher<br>
molecular weight species would be recovered, but the lower their<br>
polydispersity.<br>
3) Number of steps: The number of steps is also an important<br>
parameter. Skipping the early steps may result in a decrease on the average<br>
size obtained in each fraction and an increase in polydispersity that<br>
becomes less and less pronounced as the molecular weight increases. If<br>
more steps are used it may increase the resolution of most fractions, but it<br>
will decrease the average amount of CA in each fraction.<br>
4) Temperature. Lower temperature increases the strength of binding<br>
and may decrease the size of species coming down in each fraction.<br>
In the invention the polydisperse polysaccharide may be a naturally<br>
occurring polysaccharide, a hydrolysis product thereof or a functionalised<br>
derivative of either of these. The invention is of particular utility in<br>
separating naturally occurring polysaccharides such as bacterial<br>
polysaccharides, for instance polysaccharide antigens. The invention is of<br>
particular utility in separating sialic acid polymers and copolymers, for<br>
instance poly(2,8-linked sialic acid), poly(2,9-linked sialic acid) or an<br>
alternating 2,8-2,9-linked PSA. Preferably the polysaccharide is colominic<br>
acid (CA) or an oxidised, reduced, aminated and/or hydrazide derivative<br>
thereof.<br>
The polydispersity of molecular weight (that is the weight average<br>
molecular weight divided by the number average molecular weight) of the<br>
polydisperse polysaccharide should be at least 1.1, preferably at least 2.0.<br>
We have found that the process has particular utility where the weight<br>
average molecular weight of the polydisperse polysaccharide is at least 1<br>
kDa, preferably at least 10 kDa, and preferably at least 100 kDa.<br>
The process is of use for producing very low polydispersity<br>
polysaccharide fractions. For instance the product polysaccharide<br>
recovered from the eluted fractions preferably has polydispersity less than<br>
1.5, most preferably less than 1.25, for instance 1.1 or even lower. We have<br>
found it possible to achieve polydispersities down to around 1.01.<br>
Preferably the polysaccharide starting material has at least 1, more<br>
preferably at least 5, more preferably at least 10, for instance at least 50,<br>
saccharide units. Preferably the polysaccharide is polysialic acid (PSA)<br>
comprising sialic acid units linked a (2,8) or a (2,9) to one another.<br>
There is no particular upper limit on the size of polydisperse<br>
polysaccharides to be fractionated. In the case of PSA, however, we find<br>
that most polymers of utility have a weight average molecular weight of up to<br>
150 kDa.<br>
The PSA may be derived from any source, preferably a natural source<br>
such as a bacterial source, e.g. E. coli K1 or K92, group B meningococci, or<br>
even cow's milk or N-CAM. The sialic acid polymer may be a<br>
heteropolymeric polymer such as group 135 or group V of N. meningitidis, or<br>
may be synthesised. The PSA may be in the form of a salt or the free acid.<br>
It may be in a hydrolysed form, such that the molecular weight has been<br>
reduced following recovery from a bacterial source. The PSA may be<br>
material having a wide spread of molecular weights such as having a<br>
polydispersity of more than 1.3, for instance as much as 2 or more.<br>
Preferably the polydispersity of molecular weight is less than 1.2, for<br>
instance as low as 1.01.<br>
The following description describes the preferred embodiments of the<br>
process of the present invention carried out on the polysaccharide PSA for<br>
which the invention is of particular utility.<br>
A population of PSAs having a wide molecular weight distribution may<br>
be fractionated into fractions with lower polydispersities, i.e. into fractions<br>
with differing average molecular weights. Fractionation is preferably anion<br>
exchange chromatography, using for elution a suitable basic buffer. When<br>
the polysaccharide has carboxylic acid groups then anion exchange is<br>
particularly desirable. We'have found a suitable anion exchange medium; a<br>
preparative medium such as a strong ion exchange material based on<br>
activated agarose, having quaternary ammonium ion pendant groups (ie<br>
strong base). The choice of medium will be dependent upon whether pH or<br>
ionic strength is the means for fractionation, and will be apparent to a person<br>
skilled in the art. The elution buffer is non-reactive and is preferably volatile<br>
so that the desired product may be recovered from the base in each fraction<br>
by evaporation. Suitable examples are amines, such as triethanolamine.<br>
Recovery may be by freeze-drying for instance. The fractionation method is<br>
suitable for a PSA starting material as well as its derivatives. The technique<br>
may thus be applied before or after the essential process steps on related<br>
inventions described in PCT/GB04/03488, application filed even date<br>
herewith (agent's ref: HMJ03917) and application filed even dated herewith<br>
(agent's ref: HMJ03871), in which we describe various derivatisation<br>
reactions carried out on polysialic acids and intermediates formed therein.<br>
It is believed this is the first time IEC has been applied to fractionate<br>
ionic polysaccharides with molecular weights above about 5 kDa, especially<br>
PSA of such molecular weights.<br>
According to a further aspect of this invention there is provided a<br>
process for fractionating a population of ionic polysaccharide with a<br>
molecular weight higher than 5kDa using IEC using in the elution buffer a<br>
base or acid which is preferably volatile.<br>
Preferably the polysaccharide has carboxylic acid groups and the ion<br>
exchange is anion exchange. Preferably the elution buffer contains an<br>
amine, more preferably triethanolamine. Most preferably the<br>
polysaccharides are recovered from the fractions by drying, preferably under<br>
reduced pressure, most preferably freeze-drying.<br>
This method can be applied for the fractionation of CA having reactive<br>
moieties which are stable in water (maleimide or iodoacetate etc.) and other<br>
natural (e.g. dextran sulphate) and synthetic (e.g. polyglutamic acid,<br>
polylysine, hyaluronic acid) charged polymers. Cation and anion exchange<br>
chromatography can also be used for fractionation of charged polymers<br>
using salt or pH gradient.<br>
It is believed that it is also the first time that IEC has been used to<br>
separate ionic polysaccharides in combination with precipitation techniques<br>
and/or ultrafiltration methods.<br>
The I EC method may remove by products such as endotoxins which<br>
remain in the commercially available PSAs and CAs.<br>
Ion pair and hydrophobic interaction chromatography can also be<br>
used for fractionation of polymers and protein-polymer conjugates.<br>
In the invention there is provided a new process for producing a<br>
series of narrow polydispersity (pd 
polysaccharide, preferably PSA compound (native or activated ), in which<br>
the high polydispersity, negatively charged starting material is bound to an<br>
anion exchange resin and the fractions are eluted with a series short washes<br>
each with a progressively higher ionic strength.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, +ve and -ve charged broad disperse<br>
polymers and protein-polysaccharide conjugates can be fractionated by<br>
cation or anion exchange chromatography respectively.<br>
According to an another aspect of the invention there is provided a<br>
new process in which a polysialylated macromolecule, where the product is<br>
polydisperse owing to the polydispersity of the polysialic acid starting<br>
material conjugated to the macromolecule, is fractionated into narrow<br>
polydispersity preparations using the same IEC and step gradient strategy<br>
as described above.<br>
In the process the parameters (e.g. amount of matrix used, amount of<br>
sample loaded, temperature, flow rate, gradients etc.) are preferably<br>
optimized for fractionation of a polysialylated macromolecule (for instance),<br>
where the product is polydisperse owing to the polydispersity of the PSA<br>
starting material conjugated to the macromolecule, is fractionated into<br>
narrow polydispersity preparations using the same IEC and step gradient<br>
strategy as described above. These steps are carried out under conditions<br>
such that there is substantially no mid-chain cleavage of the backbone of a<br>
long-chain (polymeric) starting material, that is no substantial molecular<br>
weight reduction should occur.<br>
The narrow dispersed polysaccharides can be used to generate<br>
active groups. For instance aldehyde groups are suitable for conjugating to<br>
amine-group containing substrates or hydrazine compounds. Processes in<br>
which the activated product of an oxidation step is subsequently conjugated<br>
to substrate compound are described. Preferably the conjugation reaction<br>
(as described in our earlier publications mentioned above) involves<br>
conjugation of PSA with an amine to form a Schiff base, preferably followed<br>
by reduction to form a secondary amine moiety. The process is of particular<br>
value for derivatising proteins, of which the amine group is suitably the<br>
epsilon amine group of a lysine group or the N-terminal amino group. The<br>
process is of particular value for derivatising protein or peptide<br>
therapeutically active agents, such as cytokines, growth hormones,<br>
enzymes, hormones, antibodies or fragments. Figures 1 and 2 show<br>
reaction schemes for such reactions, wherein the polysaccharide is PSA.<br>
Alternatively the process may be used to derivatise drug delivery<br>
systems, such as liposomes, for instance by reacting the aldehyde with an<br>
amine group of a liposome forming component. Other drug delivery systems<br>
are described in our earlier case US-A-5846951. Other materials that may<br>
be derivatised include viruses, microbes, cells, including animal cells and<br>
synthetic polymers.<br>
Alternatively the substrate may have a hydrazine group, in which case<br>
the product is a hydrazone. This may be reduced if desired, for additional<br>
stability, to an alkyl hydrazide.<br>
The derivatisation of proteins and drug delivery systems may result in<br>
increased half life, improved stability, reduced immunogenicity, and/or<br>
control of solubility and hence bioavailability and pharmaco-kinetic<br>
properties, or may enhance solubility actives or viscosity of solutions<br>
containing the derivatised active.<br>
Preferably the polysaccharide compounds recovered from eluted<br>
fractions comprise sialic acid units, most preferably consist of sialic acid<br>
units. More preferably the polysaccharides have 1-1000 sialic acid units, for<br>
instance 10-500, more preferably 10 to 50 sialic acid units. The eluted<br>
fractions may consist of monomers, dimers, or larger polymers. Preferably,<br>
the polydispersity of a fraction will be less than 1.26, ideally less than 1.2,<br>
and ideally in the range 1.01 to 1.10.<br>
It is believed that this is the first time that a polysialic aid, particularly<br>
CA, having a polydispersity of molecular weight of less than 1.26 has been<br>
isolated. Accordingly, a further aspect of the present invention provides a<br>
polysialic acid having a polydispersity of molecular weight of less than 1.26,<br>
preferably no more than 1.2, most preferably in the range 1.01 to 1.10. The<br>
polysialic acid may be CA, or an oxidised, reduced, aminated and/or<br>
hydrazide derivative thereof. Preferably, the polysialic acid has a molecular<br>
weight of at least 5kDa, preferably at least 10kDa.<br>
The fractionation process that we described here is linearly scalable<br>
and reproducible. It is suitable for industrial scale production and for control<br>
of polydispersity of CA. The fractionation technology, described here, allows<br>
for fractionatjon of CA as well as other polysaccharide (preferably charged),<br>
protein-polymer conjugates and vaccines to be prepared with a homogenous<br>
(moriodispersed) polymer chain length.<br>

Examples<br>
Materials<br>
Ammonium carbonate, ethylene glycol, PEG (8KDa), sodium<br>
cyanoborohydride (&gt; 98% pure), sodium meta-periodate, triethanolamine,<br>
sodium chloride, sodium nitrate, sodium azide, PBS tablets and molecular<br>
weight markers were obtained from Sigma Chemical Laboratory, UK. The<br>
CA used, linear alpha-(2-&gt;8)-linked E coli K1 PSAs (22.7 kDa average, high<br>
polydispersity 1.34; 39kDa, p.d. 1.4; 11 kDa, p.d. 1.27) was from Camida,<br>
Ireland, Other materials included 2,4 dinitrophenyl hydrazine (2,4 DNPH)<br>
(Aldrich Chemical Company, UK), dialysis tubing (3.5kDa and 10kDa cut off<br>
limits; Medicell International Limited, UK), Sepharose SP HiTrap, PD-10<br>
columns (Pharmacia, UK), Tris-glycine polyacrylamide gels (4-20%), Trisglycine<br>
sodium dodecylsulphate running buffer and loading buffer (Novex,<br>
UK), Sepharose Q FF and DEAE (Amersham Biosciences, UK), Tris-Borate-<br>
EDTA (TBE) polyacrylamide gels (4-20% and 20%), TBE buffer and loading<br>
buffer (Invitrogen, UK). Deionised water was obtained from an Elgastat<br>
Option 4 water purification unit (Elga Limited, UK). All reagents used were of<br>
analytical grade. A plate reader (Dynex Technologies, UK) was used for<br>
spectrophotometric determinations in protein or CA assays.<br>
Methods<br>
Protein and colominic acid determination<br>
Quantitative estimation of PSAs (as sialic acid) was carried out by the<br>
resorcinol method [Svennerholm 1957] as described elsewhere [Gregoriadis<br>
et. al., 1993; Fernandes and Gregoriadis, 1996, 1997]. Protein was<br>
measured by the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) colorimetric method.<br>
20<br>
Example 1: Preparation of monofunctional PSA :<br>
1a Activation of CA<br>
Freshly prepared 0.02 M sodium metaperiodate (NalO4; 6 fold molar<br>
excess over CA) solution was mixed with CA at 20°C and the reaction<br>
mixture was stirred magnetically for 15 min in the dark. The oxidised CA was<br>
precipitated with 70% (final concentration) ethanol and by centrifuging the<br>
mixture at SOOOg for 20 minutes. The supernatant was removed and the<br>
pellet was dissolved in a minimum quantity of deionised water. The CA was<br>
again precipitated with 70% ethanol and then centrifuged at 12,000 g. The<br>
pellet was dissolved in a minimum quantitiy of water, lyophilized and stored<br>
at -20°C until further use (Figure 1; step 1).<br>
1b Reduction of CA<br>
Oxidised CA (CAO; 22.7kDa) was reduced in presence of sodium<br>
borohydride. Freshly prepared 15mM sodium borohydride (NaBH4; in 0.1 M<br>
NaOH diluted to pH 8-8.5 by diluting with dilute H2SO4 solution) was mixed<br>
with CAO (100mg CA/ml) at 20°C and the reaction mixture was stirred for up<br>
to 2h in the dark. The pH was brought down to 7 by the completion of the<br>
reaction. The oxidised/reduced CA (CAOR) was dialysed (3.5 kDa molecular<br>
weight cut-off for dialysis tubing) against 0.01% ammonium carbonate buffer<br>
pH 7 at 4CC. Ultracentrifugation was used to concentrate the CAOR solution<br>
from the dialysis tubing. The filtrate was lyophilized and stored at 4°C until<br>
further required. The determination of any aldehyde content was determined<br>
as described under 'determination of CA oxidation'(Figure 1; step 2).<br>
1c Reoxidation of CA<br>
After confirmation of no aldehyde content the CAOR was again<br>
oxidised as reported under activation of CA except CAOR was incubated<br>
with periodate solution for a longer time (up to 1h). The degree of oxidation<br>
in the CAORO product was measured on lyophilized powder obtained from<br>
this stage as well (Figure 1; step 3).<br>
21<br>
1 d Determination of the oxidation state of CA and derivatives<br>
Qualitative estimation of the degree of colominic acid oxidation was<br>
carried out with 2,4 DNPH, which yields sparingly soluble 2,4 dinitrophenylhydrazones<br>
on interaction with carbonyl compounds. Non-oxidised (CA),<br>
oxidised (CAO), reduced (CAOR) and re-oxidised (CAORO) (5mg each),<br>
were added to the 2,4-DNPH reagent (1 .Oml), the solutions were shaken and<br>
then allowed to stand at 37°C until a crystalline precipitate was observed<br>
[Shriner et. al., 1980]. The degree (quantitative) of GA oxidation was<br>
measured with a method [Park and Johnson, 1949] based on the reduction<br>
of ferricyanide ions in alkaline solution to ferric ferrocyanide (Persian blue),<br>
which is then measured at 630nm. In this instance, glucose was used as a<br>
standard.<br>
1e Preparation of CA-NH2<br>
CAO at (10-100 mg/ml) was dissolved in 2ml of deionised water with a<br>
300-fold molar excess of NH^CI, in a 50 ml tube and then NaCNBH4 (5 M<br>
stock in 1 N NaOH(aq), was added at a final concentration of 5 mg/ml. The<br>
mixture was incubated at room temperature for 3 days. A control reaction<br>
was also set up with colominic acid instead of CAO. Product colominic acid<br>
amine derivative was precipitated by the addition of 5 ml ice-cold ethanol.<br>
The precipitate was recovered by centrifugation at 4000 rpm, 30 minutes,<br>
room temperature in a benchtop centrifuge. The pellet was retained and<br>
resuspended in 2 mi of deionised water, then precipitated again with 5 ml of<br>
ice-cold ethanol in a 10 ml ultracentrifuge tube. The precipitate was<br>
collected by centrifugation at 30,000 rpm for 30 minutes at room<br>
temperature. The pellet was again resuspended in 2 ml of deionised water<br>
and freeze-dried.<br>
1f Assay for amine content<br>
The TNBS (picrylsulphonic acid i.e. 2, 4, 6-tri-nitro-benzene sulphonic<br>
acid) assay was used to determine the amount of amino groups present in<br>
the product [Satake et. al., 1960]. In the well of a microtitre plate TNBS (0.5<br>
22<br>
ul of 15 mM TNBS) was added to 90 ul of 0.1 M borate buffer pH 9.5. To<br>
this was added 10 ul of a 50 mg/ml solution of CA-amide. The plate was<br>
allowed to stand for 20 minutes at room temperature before reading the<br>
absorbance at 405nm. Glycine was used as a standard, at a concentration<br>
range of 0.1 to 1mM. TNBS trinitrophenylates primary amine groups. The<br>
TNP adduct of the amine is detected.Testing the product purified with a<br>
double cold-ethanol precipitation using the TNBS assay showed close to 90<br>
% conversion.<br>
1g Preparation of maleimide polymer (CA-M)<br>
The CAORO synthesised in Example 1 c above was reacted with 5<br>
molar equivalents of N-[(3-maleimidopropionic acid] hydrazide in 0.1 M<br>
sodium acetate for 2h at 20°C. The product hydrazone was precipitated in<br>
ethanol, resuspended in sodium acetate and precipitated again in ethanol,<br>
redissolved in water and freeze-dried. The product is useful for site-specific<br>
conjugation to the thiol groups of cysteine moieties in proteins and peptides.<br>
1h Gel Permeation Chromatography<br>
GA samples (CA, CAO, CAOR and CAORO) were dissolved in NaNO3<br>
(0.2M), CH3CN (10%; 5mg/ml) and were chromatographed on over 2x<br>
GMPWXL columns with detection by refractive index (GPC system: VE1121<br>
GPC solvent pump, VE3580 Rl detector and collation with Trisec 3 software<br>
(Viscotek Europe Ltd). Samples (5mg/ml) were filtered over 0.45um nylon<br>
membrane and run at 0.7cm/min with 0.2M NaNO3and CH3CN (10%) as the<br>
mobile phase (Figure 3).<br>
Results of Example 1: Preparation of monofunctional PSA<br>
The integrity of the internal alpha-2,8 linked NeuSAc residues post<br>
periodate and borohydride treatment was analysed by GPC and the<br>
chromatographs obtained for the oxidised (CAO), oxidised reduced (CAOR),<br>
double oxidised (CAORO), amino CA (CA-NH2) materials were compared<br>
with that of native CA. It was found (Fig.3) that oxidized (15 minutes) (CAO),<br>
reduced (CAOR), double oxidised (1hr) (CAORO) and native CA exhibit<br>
almost identical elution profiles, with no evidence that the successive<br>
oxidation and reduction steps give rise to significant fragmentation of the<br>
polymer chain. The small peaks are indicative of buffer salts.<br>
The results of quantitative assay of CA intermediates in the double<br>
oxidation process using ferricyanide were consistent with the results of<br>
qualitative tests performed with 2,4 DNPH which gave a faint yellow precipitate<br>
with the native CA, and intense yellow colour with the aldehyde containing<br>
forms of the polymer, resulting in an intense yellow precipitate after ten minutes<br>
of reaction at room temperature.<br>
The amination content of the polymer was found to be 85% by the 2,4,6-<br>
tri-nitro-benzene sulphonic acid (TNBS) assay. The PSA aldehyde derivative<br>
could also be reacted with a linking compound having a hydrazide moiety and<br>
a N-maleimide moiety to form a stable hydrazone having an active maleimide<br>
functionally useful for reacting with a thiol group. The maleimide content of the<br>
polymer was found to be 95% by the maleimide assay.<br>
Example 2 - Fractionation of Colominic Acid by IEC (CA, 22.7 KDa,<br>
pd1.34)<br>
2.1 Fractionation at large scale<br>
An XK50 column (Amersham Biosciences, UK) was packed with 900 ml<br>
Sepharose Q FF (Amersham Biosciences) and equilibrated with 3 column<br>
volumes of wash buffer (20mM triethanolamine; pH 7.4) at a flow rate of<br>
50ml/min. CA (25 grams in 200 ml wash buffer) was loaded on column at 50<br>
ml per minute via a syringe port. This was followed by washing the column with<br>
1.5 column volumes (1350ml) of washing buffer.<br>
The bound CA was eluted with 1.5 column volumes of different elution<br>
buffers (Triethanolamine buffer, 20 mM.pH 7.4, with OmM to 475mM NaCI in<br>
25 mM NaCI steps) and finally with 1000mM NaCI in the same buffer to<br>
remove all residual CA and other residues (if any). The flow rate was<br>
7ml/minute.<br>
The samples were concentrated to 20 ml by high pressure ultra filtration<br>
over a 3-10kDa membrane (Vivascience, UK). These samples were buffer<br>
exchanged into deionised water by repeated ultra filtration at 4°C. The samples<br>
were analysed for average molecular weight and other parameters by GPC (as<br>
reported in example 1 h) and native PAGE (stained with alcian blue) [Table 1<br>
and 2; Figure 4, 5,6].<br>
Example 2.2: Fractionation at medium and smaller scale<br>
The following samples were fractionated using an identical wash and<br>
gradient system on a smaller scale (1-75ml matrix; 0.2-3 gram of colominic<br>
acid):<br>
CA (CA, 22.7kDa, pd 1.34; CA, 39 KDa, pd 1.4), CAO (CAO, 22.7 kDa,<br>
pd 1.34), monofunctional CAO (RO, 22.7kDa; pd 1.34), CA-NH2 (22.7kDa, pd<br>
1.34), CAM (as per example 1g) produced were monitored throughout.<br>
Narrow fractions of CA produced using above procedure were oxidised<br>
with 20mM periodate and analysed by gel permeation chromatography (GPC)<br>
and native PAGE for gross alteration to the polymer (Fig. 7,8).<br>
Results of Example 2: Fractionation at large, medium and small<br>
scale<br>
CA and its derivatives (22.7 kDa) were successfully fractionated into<br>
various narrow species with a polydispersity less than 1.1 with m.w. averages<br>
of up to 46 kDa with different % of populations (Tables 1-2 and Figures 4-8).<br>
Table 1 shows the results of fractionating the 22.7kDa material at a scale of<br>
75ml. Figure 7 is the GPC results and Figs.4-6 are native PAGEs of CA<br>
fractions.<br>
(Table Removed)   The 22.7kDa material is separated on a larger scale. Using GPC the<br>
fractions from ion exchange are analysed.<br>
All narrow fractions were successfully oxidised with 20mM periodate<br>
and samples taken from different stages of the production process and<br>
analysed by GPC and native PAGE showed no change in the molecular<br>
weight and polydispersity. The data for some of the samples are shown in<br>
Fig.8.<br>
Example 3 Factors affecting the fractionation of CA<br>
The various factors affecting the fractionation of CA (e.g. washing<br>
volume etc.) were studied [Fig. 7 -14].<br>
Results of example 3: Factors affecting the fractionation of CA<br>
The various factors affecting the fractionation of CA were studied. The<br>
binding studies were done by loading 50, 100, 150 and 200mg of CA on to<br>
the column (5ml matrix). Using 200mg of CA, more than 99% of CA was<br>
bound to the column (Figure 9). When the column was washed with one<br>
column volume of eluting buffer, by step gradient, the polydispersity of<br>
polymer was found to be more than 1.1 (Fig. 11). The washing of the column<br>
with 1.5 column volume generated CA fractions with polydispersities less<br>
thanThe amino CA (CA-NH2; Fig. 12), oxidised CA (Fig. 13) and<br>
monofunctional CA could successfully be fractionated in the fractions with<br>
polydispersity 1.1.<br>
Example 4 - Synthesis of growth hormone (GH)-CA conjugates<br>
(broad and narrow dispersed)<br>
CAO (22.7 KDa) and narrow dispersed-CAO (27.7kDa pd= 1.09; 40.9<br>
kDa. pd = 1.02) prepared in Reference example 2 were used for the<br>
preparation of GH conjugates.<br>
Preparation of growth hormone-CA conjugates<br>
Growth hormone was dissolved in 0.15 M PBS (pH 7.4) and<br>
covalently linked to different CAs (CAO and NCAO). Different CAs (22kDa,<br>
CAO; 27.7kDa &amp; 40.9kDa, NCA) were individually added to GH (2mg) in a<br>
CA:GH molar ratios (12.5:1 ), sodium cyanoborohydride was added to a final<br>
concentration of 4 mg/ml. The reaction mixtures were sealed and stirred<br>
magnetically for 24h at 35±2°C. The mixtures were then subjected to<br>
ammonium sulphate ((NH4)2SO4) precipitation by adding the salt slowly<br>
whilst continuously stirring, to achieve 70% w/v saturation, stirred for 1 h at<br>
4°C, then spun (5000xg) for 15 min and the pellets resuspended in a<br>
saturated solution of (NH4)2SO4 and spun again for 15 min (SOOOxg). The<br>
precipitates recovered were redissolved in 1 ml PBS pH 7.4 and dialysed<br>
extensively (24 h) at 4°C against the same buffer. Controls included<br>
subjecting the native protein to the conjugation procedure in the presence of<br>
non-oxidised CA or in the absence of CA. Shaking was kept to a minimum to<br>
avoid concomitant denaturation of the protein. Polysialylated GH was<br>
characterised by SDS-PAGE. The polysialylated GH was passed through<br>
anion exchange chromatography and the product fractions subjected to<br>
SDS PAGE (Figure 15).<br>
Results of example 4: Synthesis of GH-CA conjugates (broad<br>
and narrow dispersed)<br>
The GH-CA conjugates were successfully synthesised. The results of<br>
SDS-PAGE (Fig. 15) show that in the control (with GH) migration of the<br>
sample is similar to that for fresh GH.. In the conjugate lanes there are shifts<br>
in the bands which typically indicates an increase in mass indicative of a<br>
polysialylated-GH. The band width was significantly narrowed down in case<br>
of conjugates with narrow dispersed polymer in comparison to conjugates<br>
with broad dispersed polymers. Further, GH conjugates (with broad<br>
dispersed polymer) were successfully separated into different species by<br>
anion exchange chromatography (Fig. 19).<br>
Example 5: Precipitation of CA<br>
Differential ethanol precipitation was used to precipitate different<br>
chain lengths of colominic acid [Fig. 1.6, 17].<br>
Results of example 5: Precipitation of CA<br>
The CA (22.7; pd 1.34) could not be precipitated into narrow<br>
dispersed fractions using different strengths of ethanol (Fig. 17). However,<br>
differential ethanol precipitation showed that smaller narrow CAs required<br>
more ethanol (EtOH). Broad 22.7 kDa polymer was precipitated with 70%<br>
EtOH giving a yield &gt;80% of product polymer. A concentration of 80% EtOH<br>
was required to precipitate &gt; 80% of a lower MW 6.5KDa (pd
process also removes part of the salt contaminating the product.<br>
Example 6: Fractionation of CA by ultrafiltration<br>
Samples of 22.7kDa were purified by ultrafiltration over different<br>
molecular weight cut off membranes (5, 10, 30, 50, and 100 kDa). In all<br>
cases retentate was examined by GPC and native PAGE [Fig. 18].<br>
Results of example 6: Fractionation of CA by ultrafiltration<br>
Samples of 22.7 kDa purified by ultrafiltration over different molecular<br>
weight cut off membranes showed that there was a decrease in<br>
polydispersity of the polymer and a shift towards higher molecular weight<br>
with increase in membrane cut off (Fig. 18). Figure 16 shows fractionation<br>
of CA by anion exchange chromatography (left) and filtration (right). IEC of<br>
CA generated fractions with much narrow dispersed CAs as compared to<br>
fractionation by filtration.<br>
Example 7: Characterization by NMR spectroscopy<br>
The fractionated CA polymers were characterized by 1H (400 MHz)<br>
and 13C (100 MHz) NMR spectroscopy for impurities (if any) using D2O (Fig.<br>
20).<br>
Results of example 7: Characterization by NMR spectroscopy<br>
The 1H and 13C NMR of narrow dispersed polymer fractionated<br>
material is free from impurities. In addition, the chemical shifts of the H-3<br>
protons in the 1H NMR and the C-2 carbon in the 13C NMR spectra confirm<br>
that the polymer is indeed the expected alpha-2,8 linked sialic acid material.<br>
Example 8: Fractionation of CA (39 kDa, pd 1.4) by IEC<br>
8.1 Fractionation at large scale<br>
An XK50 column (Amersham Biosciences, UK) was packed with 900<br>
ml Sepharose Q FF and equilibrated with 3 column volumes of wash buffer<br>
(20mM triethanolamine; pH 7.4) at a flow rate of 50ml/min. CA (12.5g in 200<br>
ml wash buffer) was loaded on column at 50 ml per minute via a syringe port<br>
This was followed by washing the column with 1.5 column volumes (1350ml)<br>
of washing buffer.<br>
The bound CA was eluted with 1.5 column volumes of elution buffer<br>
(triethanolamine, 20 mM, pH 7.4) containing different salt concentrations (0,<br>
200, 250, 300, 350, 375, 400, 425, 450, 475, 500 and 525mM NaCI) and<br>
finally with 1000mM NaCI in the same buffer to remove all residual CA and<br>
other residues (if any).<br>
The samples were concentrated to approximately 20 ml by either<br>
high-pressure ultrafiltration over a 3 or 10 kDa membrane (Vivascience, UK)<br>
or by Vivaflow 50 diafiltration (filtration by constantly passing the sample<br>
through a membrane) having a 3 kDa mwco membrane (Vivascience, UK).<br>
These samples were buffer exchanged into deionised water by either<br>
repeated ultrafiltration or Vivaflow at 4°C. The samples were analysed for<br>
average molecular weight and other parameters by GPC (as reported in<br>
Example 2) and native PAGE (4-20% Tris-glycine gel stained with alcian<br>
blue) (Figures 21 and 22).<br>
8.2 Fractionation at small scale<br>
CA was also fractionated on a smaller scale (200mg of CA) using<br>
Sepharose Q FF (5ml matrix, prepacked; Amersham Biosciences, UK)<br>
employing an identical buffer system (20mM triethanolamine; pH 7.4)<br>
containing different salt concentrations (0, 200, 250, 300, 350, 375, 400,<br>
425, 450, 475, 500, 525, 550 and 575mM NaCI). The bound CA was eluted<br>
by washing the column with 1:5 column volumes (7.5ml) at a flow rate of<br>
1ml/min with a final wash of the column using 1000mM NaCI in the usual<br>
triethanolamine buffer.<br>
The samples were concentrated to approximately 0.75 ml by Vivaspin<br>
membrane filtration (mwco 3 kDa) (Vivascience, UK), buffer exchanged into<br>
deionised water by repeated membrane filtration at 8°C and then lyophilised.<br>
The samples were analysed by native PAGE (4-20% tris-glycine gel stained<br>
with alcian blue) (Figures 23 and 24).<br>
Results of Example 8: Polydispersed CA (39 kDa; pd 1.4) was<br>
successfully fractionated into various narrow dispersed species with<br>
molecular weight averages ranging from 7 to 97 kDa and with different % of<br>
populations (Figures 21-24 and Table 4).<br>
(Table Removed) In the analysis the solvent used was 0.2M NaNO3 in MECN and PEO<br>
and dextron were used as standards. The temperature was 22°C,3 injection<br>
volume 100 uL and flow rate was 0.7 ml_/mn.<br>
* Estimated approximate values by native PAGE<br>
Figures 21 and 23 show the % population of CA in various fractions<br>
as a result of fractionating 39 kDa CA polymer on a large scale (12.5 g CA;<br>
900 ml matrix) and a small scale (200 mg CA; 5 ml matrix), respectively.<br>
Figures 22 and 24 are the native PAGEs obtained as a result of the<br>
fractionation of CA on a large and small scale. Table 4 is the GPC results of<br>
the fractions obtained by I EC at various salt concentrations. The GPC data<br>
shows that species up to 97 kDa are generated by the fractionation process<br>
(see Example 9 for further details). These larger molecular weight polymers<br>
have been shown to have a greater percentage phosphate moiety present<br>
on the reducing end of CA compared to their lower molecular weight<br>
counterparts by a phosphate assay, which tests for the presence of<br>
inorganic phosphate (Rouser et. at. 1970).<br>
Example 9: Characterisation of fractionated CA by GPC<br>
Freshly prepared CA samples, by dissolving for example either CA,<br>
CAO, CAOR or CAORO (4-5 mg/ml) in 0.2 M NaNO3/0.1% NaNa/10%<br>
acetonitrile (1 ml) (or alternatively 10mM PBS, pH 7.4) and then filtering the<br>
resulting solution over 0.2im nylon membrane (Whattman, UK), were<br>
analysed by GPC.<br>
Samples were chromatographed with 2x GMPWxl (250x4,6mm)<br>
columns employing a triple detection GPC (SEC3) system (Viscotek Europe<br>
Ltd, UK). Detectors consisted of a Viscotek Laser Refractometer (refractive<br>
index) and a Viscotek 270 Dual Detector (right-angle light scattering detector<br>
configured with a 4-capillary viscometer detector) collated with an OmniSEC<br>
3.1 workstation (Viscotek Europe Ltd).<br>
The analysis conditions used were; eluent: buffer employed to<br>
dissolve the CA sample; flow rate: 0.7ml/min; sample loading: 100ul;<br>
temperature: 22°C. The system was calibrated with narrow molecular weight<br>
polyethylene glycol and broad molecular weight Dextran reference materials.<br>
The time it takes for a polymer to be eluted from the GPC column is<br>
converted to its molecular weight using various detectors. The light<br>
scattering detector provides a direct measurement of absolute molecular<br>
weight and eliminates the need for column calibration (detector gives a<br>
proportional response to molecular weight and concentration). The radius of<br>
gyration is not calculated when measurements are performed using a single<br>
angle. The viscometer provides a direct measurement of intrinsic viscosity<br>
and allows for the determination of molecular size, conformation and<br>
structure (detector gives an inversely proportional response to molecular<br>
density). The response from the refractive index detector is proportional to<br>
the concentration of polymer: the constant of proportionality is dn/dc (the<br>
same specific refractive index increment needed in light scattering).<br>
The GPC system described above enables a number of parameters of<br>
CA to be determined. For instance, the number average molecular weight<br>
(Mn) and the weight average molecular weight (Mw) can be obtained and<br>
from these numbers the polydispersity of CA can be calculated. Other<br>
information acquired from the GPC data include the percentage recovery of<br>
CA and the degree of branching (if any) on the polymer. The exact<br>
concentration of the sample can also be determined from the dn/dc value (or<br>
alternatively the dn/dc value can be calculated from the exact known<br>
concentration of the polymer).<br>
Results of Example 9: Table 5 shows typical data for a range of<br>
parameters that was obtained from the analysis of a CA fraction (400mM<br>
NaCI in 20mM triethanolamine, pH 7.4) from IEC fractionation of CA (39 kDa,<br>
pd 1.4). In this tabe, the following definitions apply:<br>
Mn = number average molecular weight<br>
Mw = weight average molecular weight<br>
Mz = Z-average molecular weight<br>
Mp = peak average molecular weight<br>
Mv = viscosity average molecular weight<br>
Mw/Mn = molecular weight distribution (polydispersity)<br>
Rh = hydrodynamic radius<br>
IV = intrinsic viscosity<br>
dn/dc = change in refractive index with concentration for<br>
the sample<br>
(Table Removed) For example, 27,956 and 26,666 Da were the values for Mw and Mn,<br>
respectively, which gave a polydispersity of 1.048. Table 4 shows the range<br>
of narrow dispersed molecular weights obtained by GPC analysis on the<br>
fractionation of polydispersed CA (39 kDa; pd 1.4) with IEC, while Figure 25<br>
shows a typical GPC chromatogram for the combined viscometer,<br>
refratometer and light scattering curves obtained for a narrow dispersed CA<br>
sample.<br>
Example 10: Optimisation Studies<br>
10.1 Optimisation of the analysis of CA by native PAGE<br>
Fractionated and the non-fractionated CA have been analysed further<br>
by TBE and Tris-glycine gels on native PAGE in order to optimise the<br>
resolution of these polymers on the gel. In general, 40 ig of either narrow or<br>
broad dispersed CA was loaded, as a 20II solution containing 10II of<br>
loading buffer, per well on the gel. The gel was run at three different speeds<br>
(150, 25 or 15 mV/cm) and then stained with alican blue, followed by<br>
destaining with 2% acetic acid.<br>
Results of Example 10.1: Figure 26 demonstrates the various<br>
resolutions that can be obtained for different molecular weights of CA with 4-<br>
20% Tris-glycine, 4-20% and 20% TBE gels. From the gels it can be<br>
observed that good separation of high and low molecular weight CAs can be<br>
observed with 4-20 and 20% TBE gels, with particularly good resolution with<br>
the 20% TBE gel. Narrow bands are best observed when the gel is run at or 15 mV/cm compared to when the gel speed is 150mV/cm.<br>
10.2 Concentration of CA<br>
The filtrates of high-pressure ultrafiltration obtained from IEC<br>
fractionation of CA (22.7 kDa, pd 1.34) were concentrated by Vivaflow<br>
(mwco 3 kDa). These CA samples were analysed with the corresponding<br>
filters of the high-pressure ultrafiltration by native-PAGE using a 4-20% TBE<br>
gel (Figure 27) for any degradation of the polymer.<br>
Results of Example 10.2: Results from the native PAGE (Figure 27)<br>
of the CA samples obtained by Vivaflow purification of the filtrates show that<br>
both materials had the same molecular weight. This observation of the<br>
presence of CA in the filtrates of high-pressure ultrafiltration maybe<br>
accounted for by a process known as reptation, whereby due to the<br>
flexibility, deformability and its rod-like conformation of the CA polymer, the<br>
polymer can pass through the membrane resulting in the presence of CA in<br>
the filtrates. The gel also demonstrates that both Vivaflow and ultrafiltration<br>
can be successfully employed to process the fractions obtained by IEC<br>
fractionation of GA.<br>
Example 11: Fractionation of CA (22.7 kDa, pd1.34) by IEC using<br>
increasing ionic strength of triethanolamine/HCI<br>
Polydispersed CA was also fractionated by Sepharose Q FF (1ml<br>
matrix, prepacked) using a range of triethanolamine concentrations at pH 7.4<br>
in the absence of any salt such as NaCI. Thus, CA (40mg; 1ml) (22.7kDa; pd<br>
35<br>
1.34) was loaded on to a Q FF column (1ml matrix; prepacked; Amersham<br>
Biosciences). The bound CA was eluted by passing 1 ml of each<br>
triethanolamine buffer (50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900,<br>
1000, 1100 and 1200mM triethanolamine) through the column at a flow rate<br>
of 1ml/min with a final wash of the column using 2000mM triethanolamine.<br>
The samples were directly lyophilised and then analysed by native PAGE<br>
(TBE gel stained with alcian blue).<br>
Results of Example 11: Figure 8 demonstrates that fractionation of<br>
CA can be achieved in the presence of a varying concentration of<br>
triethanolamine at pH 7.4.<br>
Example 12: Fractionation of CA (22.7 kDa, pd 1.34) by (EC using<br>
increasing ionic strength of triethanolamine acetate<br>
Polydispersed CA was also fractionated by Sepharose Q FF (1ml<br>
matrix, prepacked) using a range of triethanolamine acetate concentrations<br>
at pH 7.4 in the absence of any salt such as NaCI. The triethanolamine<br>
acetate buffer was prepared using triethanolamine and adjusting the pH to<br>
7.4 using acetic acid. Polydispersed CA (40mg; 1 ml) (22.7kDa; pd 1.34) was<br>
loaded on to a Q FF column (1ml matrix; prepacked). The bound CA was<br>
eluted by passing 1 ml of each triethanolamine acetate buffer (300, 400, 500,<br>
600, 700, 800, 900, 1000, 1100, 1200, 1300, 1400 and 1500mM<br>
triethanolamine acetate) through the column at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with a<br>
final wash of the column using 2000mM triethanolamine acetate. A small<br>
sample of each fraction (2011) was then buffer exchanged with water using a<br>
micro membrane dialysis system, lyophilised and then analysed by native<br>
PAGE (20% TBE gel stained with alcian blue).<br>
Results of Example 12: Figure 29 demonstrates that fractionation of<br>
CA can be successfully achieved in the presence of a varying concentration<br>
of triethanolamine at pH 7.4.<br>
Example 13: Fractionation of CA (22.7 kDa, pd 1.34) using a pH<br>
gradient<br>
HEPES and ethanolamine buffer system was used to create a pH<br>
step gradient. Buffers at pH 7.6, 7.8 and 8.0 were set up using increasing<br>
concentrations of HEPES from 10 to 50mM and setting the pH to the<br>
appropriate value with NaOH. The concentration of sodium ions did not<br>
exceed 36mM, Buffers at pH 8.2, 8.3, 8.5, 8.7, 8.9, 9.1, 9.3, 9.5 and 9.7 were<br>
created by mixing appropriate amounts of 1M ethanolamine (20 to 70mM<br>
final concentration) with HEPES 50mM (10 to 50mM final concentration) and<br>
setting the pH with NaOH, making sure that the sodium ion concentration did<br>
not exceed 30mM. The final buffer was a 70mM ethanolamine pH 11.<br>
30 mg of polydispersed CA (22.7 kDa; pd 1.34) was dissolved in pH<br>
7.6 buffer (1ml_) and oaded onto a DEAE sepharose column (1ml matrix,<br>
prepacked) also with the pH 7.6 buffer. The column was washed with 5ml of<br>
the pH 7.6 buffer (flow rate 1ml/min) followed by passing 2ml of each buffer<br>
through the column, collecting 1ml fractions. SOOil of each eluted fraction<br>
was lyophilised and then re-dissolved in 50il of deionized water for analysis<br>
by native PAGE (20% TBE gel stained with alcian blue).<br>
Results of Example 12: Figure 30 demonstrates that fractionation of<br>
CA can be successfully achieved in the presence of an increasing pH<br>
strength. DEAE sepharose is an anion exchange matrix with a tertiary amino<br>
group, /V-diethyl-amino-ethyl, which looses its charge at high pH. Thus, high<br>
pH is used to deprotonate the matrix, change its charge and elute any<br>
species bound by ionic interactions on the column. A mixed gradient can<br>
also be used where a pH gradient is first used to fractionate the low<br>
molecular weight species followed by an ionic strength gradient to elute the<br>
higher m.w. species.<br>

251.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
We claim:<br>
1.	A process for separating polydisperse ionically charged polysaccharide into fractions, in which an aqueous solution of the polydisperse polysaccharide is contacted with ion-exchange resin in a column, subjected to selective elution by aqueous elution buffer, and polysaccharide is recovered from eluted fractions, characterised in that the selective elution involves washing the resin in the column sequentially with at least three elution buffers each having different and constant ionic strength or pH or both ionic strength and pH in which the second and subsequent buffers have higher ionic strength or pH, or both ionic strength and pH than the buffers of the immediately preceding step, and in that eluted fractions each have different average molecular weight and a polydispersity of less than 1.5.<br>
2.	The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein each fraction has a polydispersity of less than 1.25, optionally wherein each fraction has a polydispersity of 1.1 or less.<br>
3.	The process as claimed in claim 1 wherein the elution buffers all have the same pH.<br>
4.	The process as claimed in claim 1 wherein the difference between the ionic strength of successive steps is substantially the same.<br>
5.	The process as claimed in claim 4 wherein the said difference is 0.005 to 0.1M.<br>
6.	The process as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the ionic strength is varied by varying the level of a salt of a strong mineral acid and a strong mineral base.<br>
7.	The process as claimed in claim 1 wherein the elution buffers have successively higher pH values.<br>
8.	The process as claimed in claim 7 wherein the difference between the pH of successive steps is substantially the same.<br>
9.	The process as claimed in claim 8 wherein the said difference is 0.2 pH units.<br><br>
10.	The process as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the pH of each buffer is in the range 7.4-13.<br>
11.	The process as claimed in any of claims 7 to 10 wherein the second and subsequent buffers have higher ionic strength and pH than the buffers of the immediately proceeding step.<br>
12.	The process as claimed in any preceding claim wherein each elution buffer is used in an amount of at least 1.0 column volumes.<br>
13.	The process as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the elution buffer optionally contains a volatile acid or base and in which the recovery involves volatilisation of the volatile acid or base from the eluted fractions.<br>
14.	The process as claimed in claim 13 wherein the buffer contains a base which is an amine.<br>
15.	The process as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the weight average molecular weight of the polydisperse polysaccharide is at least 5 kDa.<br>
16.	The process as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the selective elution involves at least five steps, optionally six to twelve steps.<br>
17.	The process as claimed in any preceding claim optionally comprising a preliminary step before contact with the ion-exchange resin of non-solvent precipitation.<br>
18.	The process as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the polysaccharide is a naturally occurring polysaccharide, a hydrolysis product thereof or a functionalized derivative of either.<br>
19.	The process as claimed in claim 18 wherein the naturally occurring polysaccharide is a bacterial polysaccharide.<br>
20.	The process as claimed in claim 18 or 19 wherein the polysaccharide is a sialic acid polymer or copolymer, wherein optionally the sialic acid polymer or copolymer is in a hydrolysed form.<br>
21.	The process as claimed in claim 20 wherein the polysaccharide is a poly (2,8-linked sialic acid), a poly(2,9-linked sialic acid) or an alternating 2,8-2,9- linked PSA.<br>
22.	The process as claimed in claim 20 wherein the polysaccharide is CA or an oxidised, reduced, aminated and/or hydrazide derivative thereof.<br>
23.	The process as claimed in any of claims 20 to 22 wherein each fraction has a polydispersity of less than 1.2.<br>
24.	The process as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the polydispersity of the polydisperse polysaccharide is at least 2.0.<br>
25.	The process as claimed in any preceding claim optionally comprising conjugating fractionated polysaccharide to a protein.<br>
26.	The process as claimed in any preceding claim for separating polydisperse ionically charged protein-polysaccharide conjugates.<br>
27.	A process as claimed in any preceding claim as and when used for obtaining a polysialic acid with a polydispersity of less than 1.26.</td>
