				<td>METHOD FOR PREPARING PURIFIED PYROCATECHOL<br>
<br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing purified pyrocatechol.<br>
<br>
The invention is directed toward providing pyrocatechol freed of impurities resulting from its preparation process.<br>
<br>
According to one embodiment, the invention provides a process for obtaining pyrocatechol of high purity.<br>
<br>
Pyrocatechol (or 1,2-dihydroxybenzene) is a product that is widely used in many fields of application as a polymerization inhibitor or antioxidant in elastomers, olefins, polyolefins or polyurethane, or as a tanning agent.<br>
<br>
On account of its complexing properties, pyrocatechol is also used as a chelating agent and as a corrosion inhibitor.<br>
<br>
It also serves as an intermediate in many syntheses, especially those of fragrances, cosmetics, medicaments and pesticides.<br>
<br>
A different purity is required according to the market under consideration.<br>
<br>
Certain fields of application, for example electronics, require products of very high purity.<br>
<br>
There is thus a strong demand on the market for extremely pure products.<br>
<br>
It is not easy to obtain such products at the industrial scale since the removal of a small amount of impurities is difficult.<br>
<br>
Pyrocatechol is essentially available on the market in the form of flakes.<br>
<br>
Admittedly, the handling of flakes is easier than that of a powder, but certain applications favor pyrocatechol in powder form, on account of the improved dissolution properties.<br>
<br>
There is thus a demand in the market for diversified products.<br>
<br>
One of the routes for synthesizing pyrocatechol consists in hydroxylating phenol with hydrogen peroxide, especially in the presence of homogeneous or heterogeneous acid catalysts.<br>
<br>
Thus, as in FR 2 071 464, use may be made of a strong protic acid, i.e. an acid with a pKa in water of less than 0.1 and preferably less than -1.<br>
<br>
As examples of strong protic acids, mention may be made, inter alia, of sulfuric acid, chlorosulfuric acid, perchloric acid, sulfonic acids, for instance methanesulfonic acid, trifluoromethanesulfonic acid, toluenesulfonic acid or phenolsulfonic acid.<br>
<br>
As other examples of protic acid catalysts, mention may be made of sulfonic resins and more particularly the resins sold under various trade names. Mention may be made, inter alia, of the following resins: Temex 50, Amberlyst 15, Amberlyst 35, Amberlyst 36 and Dowex SOW.<br>
 <br>
The abovementioned resins are formed from a polystyrene backbone bearing functional groups that are sulfonic groups. The polystyrene backbone is obtained by polymerization of styrene and divinylbenzene, under the influence of an activation catalyst, usually an organic peroxide, which leads to a crosslinked polystyrene that is then treated with concentrated sulfuric or chlorosulfuric acid, leading to a sulfonated styrene-divinylbenzene copolymer.<br>
<br>
It is also possible to make use of sulfonic resins, which are phenol-formaldehyde copolymers bearing on the aromatic nucleus a methylenesulfonic group, for example the resin sold under the name Duolite Arc 9359.<br>
<br>
Other commercially available resins are also suitable for use, and mention may be made of perfluoro resins bearing sulfonic groups, and more particularly Nafion, which is a copolymer of tetrafluoroethylene and of perfluoro[2-(fluorosulfonylethoxy)propyl] vinyl ether.<br>
<br>
As other catalysts that are suitable for use in the hydroxylation processes, mention may be made of iron II and copper II complexes (FR2 121 000 and USSR 1 502 559) and any other catalyst of Fenton type.<br>
<br>
Other pyrocatechol preparation processes make use of heterogeneous catalysis. Thus, it is possible to use an acidic zeolite of titanium silicalite (or titanosilicalite-1) or iron silicalite type, of the type TS-1 (PR 2 489 816), a zeolite of MEL titanium silicalite type (EP 1 131 264) or a titanozeosilite of MPl type (EP 1 123 159). It is also possible to use an MCM-22 zeolite (PR 2 856 681).<br>
<br>
After such hydroxylation reactions, a mixture essentially comprising pyrocatechol and hydroquinone (or 1,4-dihydroxybenzene) is obtained, in variable proportions generally with a pyrocatechol/hydroquinone mass ratio of about 0.25 to 4.0, and also various by-products in much smaller amounts, especially resorcinol (or 1,3-dihydroxybenzene) and pyrogallol (or 1,2,3-trihydroxybenzene), generally in contents of about 0.5% to 4.0% by mass, these percentages being expressed relative to the amount of hydroquinone and of pyrocatechol formed.<br>
<br>
Mixtures of variable compositions comprising, by mass, from 20% to 80% of pyrocatechol, from 80% to 20% of hydroquinone, from 0.1% to 2% of resorcinol and from 0.1 % to 2% of pyrogallol are obtained.<br>
<br>
Typically, mixtures comprising, by mass, from 50% to 80% of pyrocatechol, from 20% to 50% of hydroquinone, from 0.1% to 2% of resorcinol and from 0.1% to 2% of pyrogallol are obtained.<br>
<br>
To isolate the pyrocatechol from crude mixtures of this type, a currently known method consists in distilling said mixture, to obtain pyrocatechol at the distillation head (which is the most volatile compound of the mixture) and at the distillation tail a mixture essentially comprising hydroquinone combined with small<br>
 <br>
amounts of impurities, especially resorcinol and pyrogallol.<br>
The distillate collected is known as "crude pyrocatechol".<br>
The invention proposes a process that may be performed at the industrial scale making it possible, starting with c   rude pyrocatechol, to obtain a pyrocatechol having the desired purity.<br>
Thus, the object of the invention is to propose a flexible process that can control the desired purity of pyrocatechol and obtain a product that satisfies requirements of high purity.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a pyrocatechol in the form of a crystalline powder having improved physicochemical characteristics especially in terms of flowabiiity.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a pyrocatechol in the form of a<br>
crystalline powder that may have various degrees of purity up to an extremely high<br>
purity.	■<br>
In accordance with the process of the invention and according to the chosen embodiment, which may comprise a different sequence of steps, it is possible to modulate the purity of the product obtained.<br>
A process has now been found, and it is this that forms the subject of the present invention, for preparing purified pyrocatechol from a crude pyrocatechol essentially containing pyrocatechol, small amounts of impurities including dihydroxybenzoquinone, traces of hydroquinone and phenolic compounds in a content of less than 5% by mass, characterized in that it comprises at least the following steps:<br>
-	dissolution of the crude pyrocatechol in the water used in an amount such that the concentration of the pyrocatechol in the water is between 40% and 90% by mass,<br>
-	crystallization of the pyrocatechol, by cooling to a temperature of between 0 and 20°C,<br>
-	solid/liquid separation for separating the crystalline pyrocatechol from an aqueous phase formed from the crystallization mother liquors,<br>
-	and optionally a step of drying the purified pyrocatechol.<br>
The process of the invention makes it possible to obtain, from a crude pyrocatechol that is already very clean, generally containing less than 5% (preferably less than 2.5% by mass) of impurities, to reach an extremely high purity that may be more than 99% and preferably between 99% and 99.995% by mass, and to do so with a purification yield that may be high and may exceed 90% by mass.<br>
Thus, the process of the invention proposes the purification of pyrocatechol according to an embodiment that may be performed at the industrial scale, using as<br>
 <br>
crystallization solvent in solution, exclusively water, to achieve the desired purity, which is particularly advantageous when compared with the use of an organic solvent, from an economic and environmental point of view.<br>
Yasuji Fujita et al. described in an article [Nippon Kagaku Kaishi, 1974, No. 1, p. 127-131] the reaction of safrole, isosafrole or 3,4-methylenedioxycinnamic acid with aniline hydrochloride, which leads to the formation of various products: pyrocatechol, methylenedioxybenzene, p-toluidine, p-propylaniline, p-ethylaniline, o-propylaniline, 2-methyl-2,3-dihydroindole. The reaction is performed at the scale of a few grams and it is mentioned in said article that the pyrocatechol is recrystallized from water. <br>
Thus, the article discloses that pyrocatechol may be extracted with water using a reaction medium having a quite specific composition associated with the reaction under consideration. However, it does not propose a process for purifying pyrocatechol having a low content of impurities that are of different nature from the compounds mentioned in said article and that are in different proportions.<br>
It cannot in any way be deduced from said article that it is possible at the industrial scale to purify pyrocatechol using only water to achieve purities that may be extremely high.<br>
A process for purifying pyrocatechol performed in water has never been described hitherto, for the reason that pyrocatechol is of very high solubility in water, for example at 20°C, 31.2 g/100 g of solution and at 100°C 98.2 g/100 g of solution [Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry].<br>
Usually, a person skilled in the art purifies a product by performing a crystallization in solution in a solvent in w/hich the product to be purified is sparingly soluble at the crystallization end temperature and usually an aromatic hydrocarbon, benzene or toluene, is recommended as solvent from which pyrocatechol is recrystallized.<br>
Going against the usual practice of a person skilled in the art, the Applicant proposes a process for purifying pyrocatechol performed in water, the process being able to be performed at the industrial scale, according to various embodiments.<br>
By means of controlling the process parameters, especially the concentration and the crystallization end temperature, the process of the invention makes it possible to obtain a very pure pyrocatechol with a very good purification yield, preferably of greater than 90% by mass.<br>
Thus, according to the invention, a pyrocatechol is obtained whose purity is more or less improved according to the type of embodiment of the invention.<br>
The composition of the crude pyrocatechol PC° treated according to the steps of the process of the invention may vary within a quite wide range, the process of the<br>
 <br>
invention however proving to be most especially advantageous for crude pyrocatechols essentially containing pyrocatechol in a proportion of at least 97.5% by mass (preferably of at least 99%) and small amounts of impurities of less than 2.5% by mass (preferably less than 1%). The major impurity is dihydroxybenzoquinone, and traces of hydroquinone and of phenolic compounds are present.<br>
The concentration of the various impurities is given as a guide.<br>
The ratio between the mass of dihydroxybenzoquinone and the mass of the sum of the impurities generally ranges between 0.5 and 0.8.<br>
The ratio between the mass of the phenolic compounds and the mass of the sum of the impurities usually ranges between 0.18 and 0.4.<br>
The ratio between the mass of hydroquinone and the mass of the sum of the impurities ranges between 0.02 and 0.10.<br>
The process of the invention is particularly advantageous for treating crude pyrocatechols comprising pyrocatechol in a proportion of from 97.5% to 99.9% by mass, and contents of impurities of about from 0.1% to 2.5% by mass and especially from 1% to 2% by mass relative to the total mass of the crude pyrocatechol.<br>
However, the invention may also apply to crude pyrocatechols that are richer in impurities, beyond 2.5% impurities, which may be up to 5% by mass.<br>
According to one particular embodiment, the crude pyrocatechol PC° treated according to the process of the invention is obtained, or may be obtained, from a reaction mixture derived from a hydroxylation of phenol with hydrogen peroxide in the presence of acid catalysts of the type mentioned hereinabove in the present description, followed by a distillation for recovering the crude pyrocatechol at the head.<br>
A crude pyrocatechol PC° that is particularly suitable for use in the process of the invention comprises, by mass relative to the total amount of crude pyrocatechol:<br>
-	from 97.5% to 99.9% of pyrocatechol,<br>
-	from 0.003% to 0.07% of hydroquinone,<br>
-	from 0.02% to 0.5% of phenolic compounds,<br>
-	from 0.07% to 1.5% of dihydroxybenzoquinone.<br>
In the present invention, the term "pyrocatechol" means 1,2-dihydroxybenzene (CAS RN 120-80-9) with a melting point of 103°C±1°C, "hydroquinone" means 1,4-dihydroxybenzene (CAS RN 123-31-9) with a melting point of 172°C±1C, dihydroxybenzoquinone (CAS RN 615-94-1), phenol (CAS RN 108-95-2) with a melting point of 40.9± 1°C. Melting points are especially indicated in "Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry (2004), 7th edition, Wiley VCH (electronic version)".<br>
 <br>
Irrespective of the exact nature of the crude pyrocatechol PC° treated according to the process of the invention, the steps of the process of the invention are advantageously performed under the conditions outlined hereinbelow.<br>
In order to facilitate understanding of the process of the invention, Figures 1 to 8 that represent schematically the different variants of the process of the invention are given below, without, however, limiting the scope of the invention thereto.<br>
Figure 1<br>
In accordance with the process of the invention, dissolution of pyrocatechol in water is first performed, followed by crystallization, solid/liquid separation and drying.<br>
More specifically, the process comprises the following steps:<br>
-	dissolution of the crude pyrocatechol in water,<br>
-	crystallization of the pyrocatechol,<br>
-	solid/liquid separation for separating the crystalline pyrocatechol from an aqueous phase formed from the crystallization mother liquors (Fi),<br>
-	drying of the pyrocatechol with removal of water (F2).<br>
The latter step is optional but, generally, pyrocatechol is sold in a dry form.<br>
The pyrocatechol and the water are introduced into a stirred reactor whose temperature may be controlled either using a heat exchanger or by circulating a heat-exchange fluid in a jacket with which it is equipped.<br>
As heat-exchange fluids that are suitable for use in the invention, mention may be made especially of water or an organic solvent chosen from heavy esters of carboxylic acids (for example octyl phthalate), aromatic ethers, for instance diphenyl ether and/or benzyl ether, biphenyl, terphenyls, other polyphenyls that are optionally partially hydrogenated, paraffinic and/or naphthenic oils, petroleum distillation residues, etc.<br>
The amount of water introduced to perform the dissolution of the pyrocatechol is such that the concentration of the pyrocatechol in water is between 40% and 90% by mass and preferably between 50% and 70% by mass.<br>
Advantageously, demineralized or distilled water is used in the process of the invention.<br>
The dissolution operation is preferably performed at a temperature ranging from  40 °C to 100°C.<br>
The various parameters are adjustable and the concentration may be proportionately higher the higher the chosen temperature.<br>
In a following step, crystallization of the pyrocatechol is performed by cooling from the dissolution temperature to a lower temperature of between 0 and 20°C and preferably between 0 and 10°C.<br>
The crystallization is performed in conventionally used apparatus such as<br>
 <br>
stirred reactors (known as crystallizing basins) with internal exchangers and/or circulation of a heat-exchange fluid in a jacket. The cooling may also be performed by partial evaporation of the solvent (water) under reduced pressure (between 15 mbar and 250 mbar) and optionally with recycling of the condensates.<br>
The operation generally lasts for between 120 and 600 minutes and depends on the mode of crystallization, the size of the crystallizing basins and the feed charges or streams.<br>
According to a continuous mode, the residence time, expressed as the ratio between the working volume of the reactor and the volume output of the feed stream, generally ranges between 30 minutes and 6 hours and preferably between 2 and 4 hours.<br>
The stirring is defined by the dissipated power, which is preferably between 0.4 and 1.2 kwatt/m3 of reactor volume.<br>
It is also possible to control the particle size of the product obtained by introducing crystallization seeds in a content preferably of less than 2% expressed relative to the mass of pyrocatechol crystals to be obtained. The preferred content is between 0.5% and 1% by mass. As crystallization seeds, it is possible to use a small amount of crystalline pyrocatechol originating from a preceding manufacture and of suitable particle size.<br>
The crystal size and distribution are controlled by especially varying the following parameters: initial concentration of the crude pyrocatechol, cooling temperature profile, seeding, stirring power and residence time in the crystallizing basin.<br>
At the end of the operation, a suspension of pyrocatechol crystals is obtained.<br>
Separation of the crystalline product is then performed according to standard solid/liquid separation techniques, preferably by filtration, centrifugation or draining.<br>
The separation is generally performed at the crystallization end temperature, but a different temperature may be chosen.<br>
A solid is recovered, which is essentially wet purified pyrocatechol comprising from 3% to 20% and preferably from 3% to 10% of water, depending on the separation technique used, and also an aqueous phase formed from the crystallization mother liquors (F1) essentially comprising water, pyrocatechol in a content usually of less than about 25% and preferably greater than or equal to 10% by mass.<br>
The moisture content is determined according to the general method of Karl Fischer (ISO standard 760 - 1978) on a machine of Metrohm 758 type.<br>
It should be noted that the dissolution and crystallization operations may be performed in continuous or batch mode.<br>
 <br>
According to a continuous embodiment, a cascade of reactors and of stirred crystallizing basins in series or in parallel with temperatures that may be different but chosen in the predefined zone may be provided.<br>
As mentioned previously, it is possible to subject the recovered pyrocatechol to a drying operation.<br>
The drying temperature is advantageously chosen between 50°C and 100°C and preferably between 50°C and 70°C.<br>
The drying is performed according to the usual techniques known to those skilled in the art and in conventionally used apparatus such as contact dryers at atmospheric pressure or under reduced pressure, convection dryers with air or oxygen-depleted air (such as a pneumatic dryer) or an inert gas, preferably nitrogen, with the possibility of recycling the inert gas. The pyrocatechol may also be dried according to the fluidized bed technique in air, oxygen-depleted air or nitrogen with the possibility of recycling the inert gas.<br>
The drying is performed in particular using a drying machine in a Retsch fluidized bed.<br>
After drying, a stream (F2) is obtained, formed essentially of water and the dried product, namely pyrocatechol PC1 whose chemical characteristics are as follows:<br>
-	the pyrocatechol content is greater than or equal to 99.8%,<br>
-	the hydroquinone content is less than 10 ppm,<br>
-	the dihydroxybenzoquinone content is less than 40 ppm,<br>
-	the content of phenolic compounds is less than 40 ppm.<br>
The contents of organic impurities are determined by high performance liquid chromatography. They are expressed relative to a dry product.<br>
According to the embodiment in Figure 1, the pyrocatechol content obtained is less than or equal to 99.99% approximately when the purity of the crude pyrocatechol is the lowest.<br>
Thus, higher purities may also be obtained.<br>
According to this embodiment, a purification yield of greater than or equal to 90% by mass may be obtained by selecting an initial concentration of the crude pyrocatechol in water, within the high concentration range, preferably between 50% and 90%, and a crystallization end temperature of less than or equal to 15°C and preferably between 0°C and 10'C.<br>
In accordance with the process of the invention, the pyrocatechol crystals obtained have a mass per unit volume that is higher than in the case of flakes.<br>
The apparent mass per unit volume pnt (non-tamped) of the crystals is preferably at least 0.6 g/cm3 and is even more preferentially between 0.61 and<br>
 <br>
0.66 g/cm3<br>
The apparent mass per unit volume pt (tamped) of the crystals is preferably at least 0.65 g/cm3 and is more preferentially between 0.66 and 0.75 g/cm3.<br>
The masses per unit volume are measured according to DIN standard ISO 787-11 of 30 November 1982 entitled "General methods of test for pigments and extenders. Determination of tamped volume and apparent density after tamping". The Stampfvolumeter STAV 2003 machine or any equivalent machine equipped with a standardized 250 ml specimen according to standard ISO 4788 may be used, for example.<br>
The measurement is performed on a dried pyrocatecho! with a residual moisture content of the crystals of between 0.25% and 0.5% by mass and obtained after drying in a fluidized bed at 60°C for 10 minutes.<br>
The compressibility index ic may also be defined from the measurements of the tamped and non-tamped apparent mass per unit volume according to the equation<br>
ic = (pt - Pnt)/ pt<br>
in which:<br>
-	ic represents the compressibility index,<br>
-	Pt represents the tamped apparent mass per unit volume in g/cm3,<br>
-	Pnt represents the non-tamped apparent mass per unit volume in g/cm3. The pyrocatechol obtained according to the process of the invention has a<br>
very low compressibility index ic, of less than 0.1 and preferably between 0.05 and 0.09.<br>
As regards the crystal size, it ranges after drying between 10 and 1000 μm.<br>
The crystal size expressed by the median diameter (do.s) may range between 200 μm and 500 |im, but is preferably between 250μim and 350 μm.<br>
The median diameter (do.s) is defined as being such that 50% by mass of the particles have a diameter greater or less than the median diameter.<br>
It is pointed out that the size distribution spread is expressed by the variation coefficient (CV) below:<br>
CV = (do.9-do.1)/2do.5<br>
-	do.9: 90% by mass of the particles have a diameter less than the diameter dag,<br>
-	do.5: 50% by mass of the particles have a diameter greater or less than the median diameter,<br>
-	do.1i: 10% by mass of the particles have a diameter less than the diameter do1i.<br>
The variation coefficient of the population of crystals advantageously ranges<br>
 <br>
between 0.9 and 1.1.<br>
The particle size analysis is performed on a Malvern 2000 laser granulometer in dry mode (Scirocco dispersion of the dry particles).<br>
The measurement is performed on a sample having the same moisture content as mentioned previously.<br>
Another technique for measuring the particle size lies in a screening technique performed using normalized standard screens made of stainless steel (standard NFX11-504/ISO 3310-2) using a Retsch model AS 200 laboratory screening machine at a vibration lateral amplitude of 1.5 mm.<br>
The powder is screened through 8 screens of diameter 200 mm with a mesh size of 100 μm, 200 p-m, 315μm, 500 μm, 800 μm, 1000 μm, 2500 μm and 5000 μm.<br>
The screening time determined experimentally is 300 seconds when an antistatic powder is present, and 450 seconds when it is absent.<br>
An antistatic agent of the type such as silica (Aerosil or Tixosil) may be added, generally in a proportion of 0.01% by mass.<br>
The particle size fractions obtained are weighed.<br>
The following particle size distribution is obtained:<br>
-10% by mass of the particles have a diameter of less than 200 - 250 |im,<br>
-	50% by mass of the particles have a diameter of less than or greater than 300 - 500 μm,<br>
-	90% by mass of the particles have a diameter of less than 750 - 800 μm, -100% by mass of the particles have a diameter of less than 1000 μm.<br>
As regards the flowability properties, this is determined using a Dietmar Schulze RST-0.1.pc automatic annular cell.<br>
The standard used is ASTM D6773-02 Standard Shear Test Method For Bulk Solid Using The Schuize Ring Shear Tester.<br>
A powder is considered as having excellent flowability (being free-flowing) when the flowability index ffc obtained is greater than 10 and good flowability for an index of between 4 and 10.<br>
The product is cohesive when the index is between 2 and 4 and very cohesive for an index of between 1 and 2.<br>
For an index of less than 1, the product is considered to have no flowability.<br>
According to the invention, a pyrocatechol with a flowability index of greater than 15, preferably greater than or equal to 20 and even more preferentially between 20 and 25 is obtained.<br>
Figure 2<br>
In   accordance   with   the   process   of  the   invention,   dissolution   of   the<br>
 <br>
pyrocatechol in water is first performed, followed by crystallization with evaporation, solid/liquid separation and drying.<br>
More specifically, the process comprises the following steps:<br>
-	dissolution of the crude pyrocatechol in water,<br>
-	crystallization of the pyrocatechol with evaporation and output of a stream of condensates (F3),<br>
-	solid/liquid separation allowing separation of the crystalline pyrocatechol from an aqueous phase formed from the crystallization mother liquors (F4),<br>
-	drying of the pyrocatechol with removal of water (F5).<br>
This embodiment is identical to that of Figure 1, with the exception that the evaporation performed during the crystallization step makes it possible to adjust the pyrocatechol concentration and to manage the heat balance of the reaction.<br>
The evaporation operation may be performed by heating under atmospheric pressure or under reduced -pressure ranging from 25 mbar to 1 bar, for a temperature ranging from 25°C to 100°C.<br>
The evaporation may be performed before or during the crystallization itself in batch mode or throughout the crystallization according to a continuous mode.<br>
The crystallization is performed as described in Figure 1.<br>
Following the drying, a stream (F5) is obtained, formed essentially from water and the dried product, i.e. the pyrocatechol PC2 whose physicochemical characteristics are similar to those of PC2.<br>
According to this embodiment, a purification yield of greater than or equal to 90% may be obtained by selecting a concentration of crude pyrocatechol in water as defined according to Figure 1, preferably of between 50% and 90% by mass. This may be obtained by means of a concentration operation. Similarly, a low crystallization end temperature is desired.<br>
Figure 3<br>
According to one variant of the process described in Figure 1, it is possible to envision an additional step of washing performed before the drying step. However, given the high solubility of pyrocatechol, washing is not recommended on account of the loss of yield in the washing waters.<br>
The washing is performed using a minimum amount of water representing a ratio between the mass of washing water and the mass of mother liquors constituting the moisture content of the pyrocatechol, of not more than 3 and preferably from 0.5 to 1.0.<br>
The washing may be performed on the same solid/liquid separation apparatus; or on a filter, on a drainer or in a centrifuge.<br>
 <br>
Washing makes it possible to obtain a pyrocatechol PC3 with a purity improved by a few ppm (5 to 10).<br>
More specifically, the process of Figure 3 comprises the following steps:<br>
-	dissolution of the crude pyrocatechol in water,<br>
-	crystallization of the pyrocatechol,<br>
-	solid/liquid separation for separating the crystalline pyrocatechol from an aqueous phase formed from the crystallization mother liquors (F6),<br>
-	washing with water of the pyrocatechol separated out, to collect the washing liquors (F7),<br>
-	drying of the washed pyrocatechol with removal of water (F8).<br>
The dissolution of the pyrocatechol in water, the crystallization and the separation are performed as described above, but washing of the pyrocatechol separated out is then performed before an optional drying.<br>
At the end of the operation, the washing liquors (F7), predominantly comprising water and pyrocatechol and impurities in a content ranging between 10% and 25% by mass, are collected for the crystallization end temperature range of between 5 and 15°C.<br>
The washed pyrocatechol is subjected to a drying operation as described previously, and PC3 and a stream (Fs) formed essentially from water are obtained.<br>
As in the process defined in Figure 1, a purification yield of greater than or equal to 90% may be obtained by adjusting the concentration of the crude pyrocatechol in water and the crystallization end temperature.<br>
Figure 4<br>
In accordance with the process of the invention, dissolution of the pyrocatechol in water is first performed, followed by crystallization with evaporation, solid/liquid separation, washing and drying.<br>
More specifically, the process comprises the following steps:<br>
-	dissolution of the crude pyrocatechol in water,<br>
-	crystallization of the pyrocatechol with evaporation and output of a stream of condensates (F9),<br>
-	solid/liquid separation allowing the crystalline pyrocatechol to be separated from an aqueous phase formed by the crystallization mother liquors (F10),<br>
-	washing with water of the pyrocatechol separated out, allowing the washing liquors (F11) to be collected,<br>
-	drying of the washed pyrocatechol with removal of water (F12).<br>
This embodiment is identical to that of Figure 3, except for the fact that the evaporation performed during the crystallization step makes it possible to adjust the<br>
 <br>
pyrocatechol concentration and to manage the heat balance of the reaction.<br>
The evaporation operation may be performed by heating at atmospheric pressure or under reduced pressure.<br>
The evaporation may be performed before or during the crystallization itself in batch mode or throughout the crystallization according to a continuous mode.<br>
The crystallization is performed as described in Figure 1.<br>
The washing is performed as described in Figure 3.<br>
Following the drying, a stream (F12) is obtained, formed essentially from water and the dried product, i.e. the pyrocatechol PC4, the physicochemlcal characteristics of which are similar to those of PC3.<br>
As in the process described in Figure 3, a high concentration of crude pyrocatechol in water may be obtained by also modifying the concentration operation.<br>
Figure 5<br>
In accordance with the process of the invention, a pyrocatechol PC5 of different quality is obtained according to a process comprising the following steps:<br>
-	dissolution of the crude pyrocatechol in water,<br>
-	crystallization of the pyrocatechol,<br>
-	solid/liquid separation for separating the crystalline pyrocatechol from an aqueous phase formed from the crystallization mother liquors (F13),<br>
-	drying of the pyrocatechol with removal of water (F14),<br>
-	recycling of the stream (F13) after optional concentration of said stream, in the dissolution or crystallization step,<br>
-	purging (P1) at the outlet of the concentration step or purging (P2) on the stream formed by the aqueous phase (F13) obtained from the separation of the pyrocatechol after crystallization.<br>
According to this variant of the process of the invention, the steps described previously are repeated and the stream (F13) is recycled after optional concentration of said stream in the dissolution or crystallization step.<br>
To control the pyrocatechol content in the process of the invention, it may be adjusted by concentrating the stream (F13) by evaporating a water stream (F15).<br>
According to one characteristic of the process of the invention, concentration of the stream (F13) may be performed so as to increase the pyrocatechol concentration In the stream chosen between 10% and 90% by mass and preferably between 10% and 60% by mass.<br>
The concentration operation may be performed by heating at atmospheric pressure or under a reduced pressure at a temperature of between 70°C and 100°C.<br>
 <br>
The pyrocatechol concentration is adjusted according to whether the stream is recycled in the dissolution step or in the crystallization step.<br>
Thus, a stream of water (F15) is removed during this operation.<br>
A first mode consists, while remaining in the abovementioned temperature region, in reducing the reaction pressure, by depressurization. This depressurization is performed so as to remove at the head the required amount of water to reach in the reaction medium the target pyrocatechol concentration.<br>
Another embodiment for concentrating the reaction medium consists in distilling the amount of some of the water to achieve in the reaction medium, the desired pyrocatechol concentration.<br>
The distillation may be performed at atmospheric pressure at a temperature of about 100°C.<br>
The distillation may also be performed at a pressure slightly lower than atmospheric pressure, for example from 200 to 750 mm of mercury and at a ■ temperature below 100°C. In general, the pressure is chosen to have a distillation point of between 70°C and 100°C.<br>
The distillation may also be performed at a pressure higher than atmospheric pressure.<br>
These operations are performed in standard apparatus such as distillation columns or standard evaporators at atmospheric pressure, under reduced pressure or at a pressure higher than atmospheric pressure.<br>
This concentrated stream is advantageously recycled either into the dissolution step or into the crystallization feed.<br>
In order to minimize the impurities present in this recirculation loop, it is preferable to perform one or more purges of one of the streams comprising the impurities.<br>
The purge consists in removing a fraction of said stream. It is determined such that the overall loss of pyrocatechol relative to the crude pyrocatechol is preferentially between 0.5% and 2% by mass.<br>
A purge (P1) may be performed at the outlet of the concentration zone. It is performed by means of a valve placed on the pipe conveying the concentrated stream, at the outlet of the concentration operation but before recycling.<br>
It is also possible to perform a purge (P2) on the stream formed by the aqueous phase (F13) derived from the separation of the pyrocatechol after crystallization.<br>
It is preferable to perform the purge at the outlet of the concentration area.<br>
The purge may be performed in continuous or batch mode.<br>
Controlling the purge makes it possible to adjust the chemical purity of the<br>
 <br>
pyrocatechol obtained and also the overall yield for the process.<br>
Following the various operations defined according to the schenne of Figure 5, pyrocatechol PC3 is obtained, the chemical purity of which is adjusted by withdrawing a purge stream (P1) after the concentration step or a purge stream (P2) after the step of separating the mother liquors.<br>
Following the drying, a stream (F14) is obtained, formed essentially from water and the dried product, namely the pyrocatechol PC3, the chemical characteristics of which are as follows:<br>
-	the pyrocatechol content is greater than or equal to 99.8%,<br>
-	the hydroquinone content is less than or equal to 100 ppm,<br>
-	the dihydroxybenzoquinone content is less than 700 ppm,<br>
-	the content of phenolic compounds is less than 300 ppm.<br>
According to the embodiment of Figure 5, the pyrocatechol content obtained is greater than or equal to 99.8% approximately.<br>
The physical characteristics of the crystals, tamped or non-tamped mass per unit volume, distribution of the crystals, flowability properties, are equivalent to those of pyrocatechol obtained according to Figure 1.<br>
Figure 6<br>
In accordance with the process of the invention, a pyrocatechol PC6 of quality similar to that of PC5 is obtained according to a process comprising the following steps:<br>
-	dissolution of the crude pyrocatechol in water,<br>
-	crystallization of the pyrocatechol with evaporation and output of a stream of condensates (F16),<br>
-	solid/liquid separation allowing the crystalline pyrocatechol to be separated from an aqueous phase formed from the crystallization mother liquors (F17),<br>
-	drying of the pyrocatechol with removal of water (F18),<br>
-	recycling of the stream (F17) after optional concentration of said stream, in the dissolution or crystallization step,<br>
-	purging (P3) at the outlet of the concentration step or purging (P4) on the stream formed by the aqueous phase (F17) obtained from the separation of the pyrocatechol after crystallization.<br>
This embodiment is identical to that of Figure 5, except for the fact that the evaporation performed during the crystallization step makes it possible to adjust the pyrocatechol concentration and to manage the heat balance of the reaction.<br>
To control the pyrocatechol content, it may be adjusted by concentrating the stream (F17) by evaporating a water stream (F19).<br>
 <br>
The evaporation operation may be performed by heating at atmospheric pressure or under reduced pressure.<br>
The evaporation may be performed before or during the crystallization itself in batch mode or throughout the crystallization in a continuous mode.<br>
The crystallization is performed as described in Figure 1.<br>
Following drying, a stream (F18) is obtained formed essentially from water and the dried product, i.e. the pyrocatechol PC6, the physicochemical characteristics of which are similar to those of PC5.<br>
Figure 7<br>
In accordance with the process of the invention, a pyrocatechol PC7 of different quality is obtained according to a process comprising the following steps:<br>
-	dissolution of the crude pyrocatechol in water,<br>
-	crystallization of the pyrocatechol,<br>
-	solid/liquid separation allowing the crystalline pyrocatechol to be separated from an aqueous phase formed from the crystallization mother liquors (F20),<br>
-	washing with water of the pyrocatechol separated out allowing the washing liquors (F21) to be collected,<br>
-	drying of the pyrocatechol with removal of water (F22),<br>
-	recycling of the stream (F20) after optional concentration of said stream, in the dissolution or crystallization step,<br>
-	purging (P5) at the outlet of the concentration step or purging (P6) on the stream formed by the aqueous phase (F20) obtained from the separation of the pyrocatechol after crystallization.<br>
To control the pyrocatechol content, it may be adjusted by concentrating the stream (F20) by evaporating a water stream (F23).<br>
According to one variant of the process of the invention, the washing liquors (F21) may be mixed with the crystallization mother liquors (F20) before the concentration operation.<br>
The physical characteristics of the crystals are equivalent to those of the pyrocatechol obtained according to Figure 1.<br>
The purity obtained may be modified according to the degree of recycling of the crystallization liquors, optionally the washing liquors and according to the degree of purging.<br>
Figure 8<br>
In accordance with the process of the invention, a pyrocatechol PC8 of different quality is obtained according to a process comprising the following steps:<br>
 <br>
-	dissolution of the crude pyrocateclhol in water,<br>
-	crystallization of the pyrocatechol with evaporation and output of a stream of condensates (F24),<br>
-	solid/liquid separation allowing the crystalline pyrocatechol to be separated from an aqueous phase formed from the crystallization mother liquors (F25),<br>
-	washing with water of the pyrocatechol separated out allowing the washing liquors (F26) to be collected,<br>
-	drying of the pyrocatechol with removal of water (F27),<br>
-	recycling of the stream (F25) after optional concentration of said stream, in the dissolution or crystallization step,<br>
-	purging (P7) at the outlet of the concentration step or purging (P8) on the stream formed by the aqueous phase {F25) obtained from the separation of the pyrocatechol after crystallization.<br>
To control the pyrocatechol content, it may be adjusted by concentrating the stream (F25) by evaporating a water stream (F28).<br>
According to one variant of the process of the invention, the washing liquors (F26) may be mixed with the crystallization mother liquors (F25) before the concentration operation.<br>
The physical characteristics of the crystals are equivalent to those of the pyrocatechol obtained according to Figure 1.<br>
The purity obtained may be modified according to the degree of recycling of the crystallization liquors, optionally of the washing liquors and according to the degree of purging.<br>
In accordance with the process of the invention, it is possible to purify the pyrocatechol obtained or that may be obtained from a reaction mixture derived from a hydroxylation of phenol with hydrogen peroxide in the presence of an acid catalyst followed by distillation of the pyrocatechol from the reaction mixture, using a sequence of steps chosen as a function of the targeted object.<br>
Advantageously, the various operations mentioned previously, dissolution, crystallization, separation, washing/separation, drying, concentration and recycling of the streams with purging, etc. are performed under an atmosphere of inert gases, preferably under nitrogen.<br>
It should be noted that the invention does not exclude additional steps inserted into the sequences defined by the invention, in particular the addition of a common treatment of solids, in particular a treatment with carbon black (or active charcoal), to improve the whiteness of the product obtained.<br>
For example, according to the schemes of Figures 1 to 8, it is possible to perform   this   treatment   before  the   crystallization   operation   and  following   the<br>
 <br>
dissolution operation, by adding an amount of carbon black or of active charcoal in a proportion of from 0.02% to 0.50% relative to the mass of pyrocatechol.<br>
This treatment is performed in a stirred reactor.<br>
It is followed by a solid/liquid separation performed before the crystallization step, preferably a filtration to remove the carbon black advantageously followed by a washing operation.<br>
Another embodiment for the treatment with carbon black is to use the fixed bed technique.<br>
Thus, the stream obtained from the dissolution operation is conveyed into a fixed bed of carbon black preferably in the form of granules.<br>
The carbon black granules are placed in a column and the stream containing the pyrocatechol generally passes countercurrentwise through the fixed bed.<br>
This technique makes it possible to save a separation operation.<br>
Thus, the process of the invention is particularly advantageous since it makes it possible to obtain pyrocatechol in different degrees of purity ranging between 99% and 99.995% and preferably between 99.5% and 99.99%.<br>
The lower limits of the purities achieved by the process of the invention are less than 10 ppm for hydroquinone, 40 ppm for dihydroxybenzoquinone and 40 ppm for the phenolic compounds.<br>
Finally, it should be pointed out that the process of the invention is advantageous from an economic point of view since the purification yield can reach 90% and preferably 95%) or higher in the case of the variants with recycling of the crystallization mother liquors and the washing liquors.<br>
A yield higher than this value may be obtained by separately treating the purges in the case of the processes of Figures 5 to 8 or the crystallization and washing mother liquors in the case of the processes of Figures 1 to 4. The treatment consists in recovering the pyrocatechol contained in these various streams, especially by crystallization.<br>
It is pointed out that the various weight percentages given in the present text, relative to the pyrocatechol in solid form, are expressed relative to a dry product obtained after drying to constant weight.<br>
The process of the invention leads to the production of a pyrocatechol that has its own physicochemical characteristics.<br>
Thus, it makes it possible to obtain a pyrocatechol in crystalline form that has improved flowability properties not achieved in the prior art.<br>
The pyrocatechol crystals are homogeneous in size and shape. The size distribution of the particles is of Gaussian type.<br>
Its flowability index is greater than 15, preferably greater than or equal to 20<br>
 <br>
and even more preferentially between 20 and 25.<br>
Moreover, its compressibility index is very lO\N, less than 0.1 and preferably between 0.05 and 0.09. It follows that the powder form obtained is such that it has a low volume variation under tamping constraint, which is an advantage during prolonged storage.<br>
The process of the invention makes it possible to obtain the purified pyrocatechol in a very good yield of greater than or equal to 90% according to the various modes described in Figures 1 to 8.<br>
To obtain a good yield according to these embodiments, it is important to have a high concentration of pyrocatechol during the crystallization of the pyrocatechol.<br>
To do this, a high initial concentration of the crude pyrocatechol may be chosen, preferably between 50% and 90% by mass and more preferentially between 50% and 70% by mass.<br>
In the case of a less concentrated stream, as regards the stream obtained by dissolution of the pyrocatechol in water or of the mother liquors and/or washing liquor that are recycled, a concentration operation by evaporating water is necessary in order to obtain a high pyrocatechol concentration during the crystallization: this concentration is advantageous between 50% and 90% and preferably between 50% and 70%.<br>
Thus, Figures 2 and 4 mention a concentration operation during the crystallization and Figures 5, 6, 7 and 8 indicate a concentration operation on the mother liquors and optionally on the washing liquors.<br>
Figures 6 and 8 mention both a concentration operation during the crystallization and also on the mother liquors and optionally on the washing liquors.<br>
Moreover, the yield may be improved by selecting a lower crystallization end temperature preferably of between 0°C and 15°C and more preferentially between 0°C and10°C.<br>
Examples of implementation of the invention are given below as non-limiting illustrations.<br>
Examples 1 to 8 refer, respectively, to Figures 1 to 8.<br>
Example 9 refers to Figure 1 and Example 10 to Figure 2.<br>
The purification yield is defined as being the weight ratio expressed as a mass % between the pyrocatechol obtained expressed as anhydrous product and the pyrocatechol used in the crystallization step.<br>
