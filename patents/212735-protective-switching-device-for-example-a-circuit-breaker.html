Description<br>
Protective  switching device,  for example a circuit breaker<br>
The invention relates to a protective switching device, for example a circuit breaker, whose switching mechanism between a manual operating element and at least one moving contact arm can be unlatched at a latching point between a catch and a release lever by a release device.<br>
Many versions of protective switching devices of this kind are commercially available. In order to satisfy the widely differing practical requirements, the kinematics of the switching mechanisms of such protective switching devices are relatively complicated. On the other hand, repeated attempts have been made to return the design of protective switching devices to basic simple forms, to which improvements are then once again required, however (EP-B-0 299 291). The known switchinq mechanism operates with slotted-link guides.<br>
On the other hand, switching mechanisms with what is referred to as a flying latch, that is to say a variable position latching point, have the advantage of more precise guidance and reduced friction losses, so that the required spring forces are reduced. In one known miniature circuit breaker (DE-A-1 904 731), a variable position latch is achieved using components arranged alongside one another over an area.<br>
The invention is based on the object of developinq a protective switching device with a compact switching mechanism and contact arrangement, which allows a variable position latching point.<br><br>
-la-<br>
The object described is achieved by a protective switching device for example a circuit breaker, whose switching mechanism between  a  manual operating element  and  one  moving contact arm can be unlatched at a latching point between a catch and a release lever by a release device, characterized  in  that the moving contact arm (1) is mounted in a variable position and such that i t can rotate in a lug, which surrounds this contact arm, at both  ends  on a first axle bearing, with the  catch  also  being mounted  eccentrically on this axle bearing, and in that the  lug has  a further axle bearing on both sides, on which  the  release lever is mounted eccentrically in a fixed position but such that it can rotate, and about which the lug and the moving contact arm pivot when the latter is not in contact with a stationary contact with  a first  axle  bearing  limiting  the disconection movement of the contact arm.<br><br>
- 2 -<br>
moving contact arm is mounted in a variable position and such that it can rotate in a lug, which surrounds this contact arm, at both ends on a first shaft bearing, together with the lug. The catch is also mounted eccentrically on this shaft bearing. The lug has a further shaft bearing on both sides, on which the release lever is mounted eccentrically in a fixed position but such that it can rotate. The lug and the moving contact arm also pivot about this shaft, when said contact arm is not in contact with a stationary contact. The first shaft bearing limits the disconnection movement of the contact arm, for example with the shaft making contact with an enclosure stop. This is thus also referred to an off stop.<br>
The lug forms a robust supporting element for the catch and release lever, which can be arranged in a plane above or below the contact area. The robust lug construction allows fast, low-friction contact opening with the moving contact arm being guided such that it cannot twist. No elongated hole guide is required for this purpose. The asymmetric construction over a number of planes results in the further major advantage that restrikes are avoided, which occur when a moving contact strikes against a stop which limits the contact movement, after disconnection, and bounces back, once again approaching the stationary contact of the contact pair. Since the off stop is arranged in a plane eccentrically with respect to the contact arrangement, that is to say not in the same plane as the contact arrangement, this results in torsional oscillations, which have a damping effect on the switching process, in the event of a tripping strike by the impact armature of a tripping device. The described construction therefore combines firstly robust guidance, without any twisting, for the moving contact arm with, secondly, damping torsional oscillations applied to the release lever during disconnection. This avoids restrikes. Guiding the contact arm without any twisting also prevents irregular contact positions.<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
On the other hand, construction over a number of planes also has the advantage that this results in a compact arrangement of the switching mechanism and contact arm.<br>
The shaft bearing for the release lever can advantageously be arranged on the contact-making side of the contact arm with respect to the shaft bearing for the contact arm. In consequence, one spring on the contact arm is sufficient to produce the contact force and the pull-off force for contact opening. Once again, this means that there is no need for a number of spring forces, which would in turn compensate for one another, with reduced effect, for different switching sequences.<br>
The catch can provide the mounting for a coupling rod for the manual operating element in a variable position catch bearing at a distance from the bearing for the contact arm, and this assists the construction of the<br>
switching mechanism.<br>
The contact arm can advantageously be formed in two parts from components which are arranged one above the other in the shaft direction. A base part can be composed of mechanically strong material, and a contact support or a contact-forming head region can be composed of electrically highly conductive material, which can be optimized for the protective switching device. The base part and contact support can be arranged such that one is above the other and they overlap in the shaft direction, which allows simple production.<br>
A snap-action switching mechanism can be connected to the manual operating element in such a manner that, during manual connection, a spacing body with a dropoff edge is drawn away between the contact pair, resulting in sudden connection. Such snap-action switching mechanisms are known in various embodiments<br>
(DE-A-4 016 364). Snap-action switching mechanisms such as these lead to particularly intensive switching impacts, which are damped by the design according to the invention.<br><br>
- 4 -<br>
A magnetic release can be arranged such that its plunger, also referred to as an impact armature, acts on the release lever, forming a long lever arm.<br>
It is advantageous for a spring to act on the contact arm, between the shaft bearing for the contact arm and the shaft bearing for the release lever. The spring is advantageously arranged at the side of the manual operating element, and is in the form of a tension spring. This spring then produces the contact force and the contact opening force, without needing to overcome any opposing spring force. The lug can be connected to a switch position indicator. The moving contact arm can be quided in the luq between additional quide ribs.<br>
The invention will now be explained in more detail with reference to exemplary embodiments which are illustrated, in some cases roughly and schematically, in the accompanying drawing. <br>
Figure 1 shows a perspective view of a major assembly of the protective switching device. A lug engages on both sides around a moving contact arm and forms shafts for a shaft bearing.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates the assembly shown in Figure 1, in the form of an exploded illustration.<br>
Figure 3 shows a protective switching device having a manual operating element, a switching mechanism and a contact arrangement, as well as a plunger of a magnetic release (which is not shown for the sake of clarity) in the disconnected position.<br>
Figure 4 shows the connected position, illustrated in the same manner as in Figure 3.<br><br>
- 5 -<br>
Figure 5 shows, schematically, a snap-action connection process, with further components as shown in Figures 3 and 4 being omitted for the sake of clarity.<br>
Figure 6 shows the initiation of the impact for unlatching, illustrated in the same manner as in Figures 3 and 4 and in conjunction with an illustrated switching spring, with the plunger of a magnetic release just coining into contact with the release lever.<br>
Figure 7 shows an additional switch position indication, illustrated in the same manner as in Figures 3 and 4.<br>
The protective switching device has a moving contact arm 1 as shown in Figure 1, which is mounted in a variable position and such that it can rotate, together with the lug, in a lug 2 which surrounds the contact arm 7, at both ends on a first shaft bearing 3 in the kinematics ot the switching mechanism. The lug 2 has a further shaft bearing 4 on both sides, on which a release lever can be mounted eccentrically in a fixed position and such that it can rotate. The lug and the moving contact arm also pivot about this further shaft, when the contact arm is not in contact with the stationary contact 7, as shown in Figure 3. The first shaft bearing 3 also limits the disconnection movement of the contact arm 1. Figure 3 should be referred to in this context.<br>
Figure 3 shows the disconnected position. The fixed-position shaft bearing 4 for the release lever is arranged on the contact-making side of the contact arm with respect to the variable position shaft bearing 3 for the contact arm 1. Together with a stationary contact 7, the contact arm 1 forms a contact pair. The catch 6 provides the mounting for a coupling rod 9 for a manual operating element 10 in a variable position<br><br>
- 5a -<br>
catch bearing 8 at a distance from the bearing 3 for the contact arm 1.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment, the contact arm 1 is formed in two parts from components which are arranged one above the other in the shaft direction-<br><br>
- 6 -<br>
A base part 11 composed of mechanically strong material is mechanically firmly connected at the side to a contact support 12 or to a head region forming a contact part, for example by means of electrical spot welding. Electrodynamic tripping can be carried out by means of an electromechanical release, whose plunger 13 is shown.<br>
Figure 4 shows the connected position, once the manual operating element 10 has pivoted out of the disconnected position shown in Figure 3. A conventional electrothermal release has been omitted from both Figure 4 and Figure 3, for the sake of clarity.<br>
As a supplement to the illustration in Figure 4, Figure 6 shows a spring 14, which acts on the contact arm 1, between the shaft bearing 3 for the contact arm and the shaft bearing 4 for the release lever 5. Furthermore, the moment is shown at which the plunger 13 strikes the release lever 5 as a result of electrodynamic tripping, in order to initiate the unlatching that results from the catch 6 dropping off the release lever 5. It is advantageous for the plunger 13 to act on the release lever 5 forming a longer lever arm 15.<br>
Figure 5 shows a snap-action switching mechanism 16 which is also provided and is connected to the manual operating element 10. During manual connection, a spacing body 17 with a drop-off edge 18 is drawn away between the contact pair 19, resulting in sudden connection, during which the contact arm strikes the stationary contact 7. Such a snap-action switching mechanism is known in principle in various embodiments (DE-A-4 016 364). The impact forces produced by such a snap-action switching mechanism are absorbed with a damping effect by the described arrangement of the moving contact arm 1, the lug 2, the release lever 5,<br>
the catch 6 and the off stop on the first shaft bearing 3. In the exemplary embodiment shown in Figure 6, the switching<br>
Spring 14 is arranged:-<br><br>
- 7 -<br>
at the side of the manual operating element 10, and is in the form of a tension spring.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment shown in Figure 7, a switch position indicator 20 is connected to the lug 2. In   this case,  a visible symbol 21 is pivoted under a sightglass 22/ coupled to a switch position.<br>
The moving contact arm can also be guided in the lug 2 by means of guide ribs 23.<br><br>
