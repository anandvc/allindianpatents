Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention concerns materials, methods and models<br>
relating generally to the labelling and detection of<br>
neurof ibrillary tangles. In addition, it concerns the<br>
identification and development of ligands suitable for<br>
neuropathological staging and their use in the diagnosis, prognosis<br>
or treatment of diseases such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD) .<br>
Background to the invention<br>
Neuropathological staging and AD<br>
The neuropathological staging proposed by Braak (Braak, H et al.<br>
(1991), Acta. Neuropathol. 82, 239-259) provides the best available<br>
definition of progression of relatively pure neurofibrillary<br>
degeneration of the Alzheimer-type which is diagnostic of AD<br>
(Wischik et al. (2000), "Neurobiology of Alzheimer's Disease", Eds.<br>
Dawbarn et al.. The Molecular and Cellular Heurobiology Series,<br>
Bios Scientific Publishers, Oxford). This staging is shown<br>
schematically in terms of brain region in Fig 2B, and is based on a<br>
regular regional hierarchy of neurofibrillary tangle (NET)<br>
distribution. Regions of the brain which appear earlier in the<br>
hierarchy have both more tangles and are affected in less severe<br>
cases than those later in the list.<br>
Relationship between AD, clinical dementia and neuropathological<br>
staging<br>
The provision of an effective pre-mortem assessment of Braak Stage<br>
would be of use in the assessment and treatment of AD, for which<br>
the differential includes Lewy Body dementia, Parkinson's disease,<br>
various forms of fronto-temporal and cortico-basal degeneration,<br>
progressive supranuclear palsy and a range of rare neurological<br>
syndromes.<br>
The original model proposed by Braak was essentially qualitative in<br>
nature, and was not linked to any implications about the threshold<br>
for development of clinical dementia and symptoms.<br>
In terms of the appearance of clinical dementia by DSM-IV criteria,<br>
this corresponds statistically to the. transition between Braak<br>
stages 3 and 4 (Fig 2c). The DSM-IV criteria (Diagnostic and<br>
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition, American<br>
Psychiatric Association, American Psychiatric Press, Washington DC<br>
(1994)) for the definition of dementia equate to an MMSE (Mini-<br>
Mental State Examination) cut-off point of about 18, and<br>
corresponds to a dementia prevalence of about 5% of the population<br>
over-65 years old (over-65's represent about 17% of the total<br>
population).<br>
Gertz et al. ((1996) Bur. Arch. Psychiatry Clin. Neurosci. 246,<br>
132-6)) studied cases followed from general practice to post-<br>
mortem, which were rigorously characterised at the clinical level<br>
using CAMDBX (Roth et al, 1988, "The Cambridge Examination for<br>
Mental Disorders of the Elderly (CAMDEX)" Cambridge University<br>
Press) . These were staged post-mortem by the criteria of Braak<br>
and, after excluding all cases with any degree of vascular<br>
pathology found post-mortem, there remained uncertainty in about<br>
o.ne third of cases at the point of transition. That is, about one<br>
third of cases with a clinical diagnosis of AD are actually at<br>
early Braak stages (stages 1-3), have vascular pathology, or have<br>
concomitant Lewy body pathology. Thus there exists a high degree<br>
of uncertainty, even in the best practice research setting. The<br>
predominant neuropathological substrate that is actually present<br>
when a routine clinical diagnosis of AD is made is even more<br>
uncertain.<br>
It has recently been reported that a molecule(FDDNP, 2-(l-{6-[(2-<br>
[16F]fluoroethyl) (methyl)amino]-2-naphthyl)ethylidene)malononitrile)<br>
demonstrates increased relative retention time (RRT) in medial<br>
temporal lobe brain regions (hippocampus, entorhinal cortex and<br>
amygdala) following injection and PET imaging in cases with a<br>
clinical and neuroradiological diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease<br>
(Shoghi-Jadid et al., Am. J. Geriatr. Psychiatr. 2002, 10:24-35).<br>
Although binding to NFTs and amyloid plaques is discussed, no<br>
binding to NFTs is shown, although the compound does bind with high<br>
affinity to synthetic beta-amyloid fibrils in vitro.<br>
When cases were matched for corresponding disease severity by MMSE<br>
score with a neuropathological case series in which vascular<br>
pathology was'excluded, the RRT values reported by Shoghi-Jadid et<br>
al. were found to correlate with beta-amyloid plaque counts but not<br>
with measures of neurofibrillary tangle pathology, as shown below.<br>
Where the parameters are defined as follows<br>
MTL AP medial temporal lobe amyloid plaques<br>
Global AP average amyloid plaque load in 12 brain regions<br>
MTLNFT medial temporal lobe neurofibrillary tangles<br>
Global NET average NET load in 12 brain regions<br>
However, beta-amyloid deposition is known to discriminate poorly<br>
between normal aging and Alzheimer's disease (see Figure 2d<br>
herein), and beta-amyloid pathology does not provide a sound basis<br>
for neuropathological staging (Braak and Braak, 1991). Therefore,<br>
FDDNP-RRT does not provide a method for in vivo neuropathological<br>
staging of Alzheimer's disease.<br>
Although it is possible that further refinement in clinical methods<br>
with particular reference to more specific neuropsychological<br>
indicators (e.g. split attention tasks, delayed matching to sample,<br>
etc.) may improve the accuracy of clinical diagnosis, an essential<br>
problem is to develop methods for the direct measurement of<br>
underlying neuropathology during life, in particular the extent of<br>
neurofibrillary degeneration of the Alzheimer-type.<br>
Progression of neurofibrillary degeneration and tau<br>
As described above, the tau-based pathology of AD is a major<br>
feature of the phenotype. It is highly correlated with extent of<br>
neuronal destruction (reviewed in Wischik et al. (2000) loc clt) .<br>
On a cellular basis, the formation of NFTs from Tau is believed to<br>
proceed as follows. In the course of their formation and<br>
accumulation, paired helical filaments (PHFs) first assemble as<br>
filaments within the cytoplasm, probably from early tau oligomers<br>
which become truncated prior to, and in the course of, PHF assembly<br>
(Refs 26,27). They then go on to form classical intracellular<br>
NFTs. In this state, PHFs consist of a core of truncated tau and a<br>
fuzzy outer coat containing full-length tau (Wischik et al. (2000)<br>
loc. clt.). The assembly process is exponential, consuming the<br>
cellular pool of normal functional tau and inducing new tau<br>
synthesis to make up the deficit (Ref 29). Eventually functional<br>
impairment of the neurone progresses to the point of cell death,<br>
leaving behind an extracellular NFT. Cell death is highly<br>
correlated with the number of extracellular NFTs (Bondareff, W. et<br>
al. (1993) Arc. Gen. Psychiatry 50: 350-6) . As the outer neuronal<br>
membrane is damaged and NFTs are extruded into the extracellular<br>
space, there is progressive loss of the fuzzy outer coat of the<br>
neurone with corresponding loss of N-terminal tau immunoreactivity,<br>
but preservation of tau immunoreactivity associated with the PHF<br>
core (Figure 3; Ref 30).<br>
In the process of aggregation, tau protein undergoes a<br>
conformational change in the repeat domain associated with a half-<br>
repeat phase-shift (Refs 32,33). This creates a proteolytically-<br>
stable fragment which is identical to that found in the core of the<br>
paired helical filaments (PHFs) which constitute the<br>
neurofibrillary tangles characteristic of AD. By analogy with other<br>
protein aggregation systems, the process most likely involves an<br>
alpha-helix to beta-strand change in conformation (reviewed in<br>
Wischik et al. (2000) loc. cit.).<br>
Generally speaking therefore, the aggregation of tau can be<br>
considered in 3 stages: intracellular oligomers: intracellular<br>
filaments (stage 1 of Fig 3); extracellular filaments (stages 2 &amp; 3<br>
of Fig 3).<br>
However, to date, no definitive correlation has been established<br>
between these stages, which occur at the cellular level, and<br>
possibly at different rates and probabilities in different regions<br>
in the brain, and the progression of pathology according to the<br>
defined hierarchical system of Braak and Braak which, as discussed<br>
above, is the best available definition of progression of<br>
relatively pure neurofibrillary degeneration.<br>
Invasive methods for assessing AD<br>
Lumbar-puncture CSF measurements enable discrimination between AD<br>
and controls, and between AD and other neurological disorders, but<br>
lumbar-puncture is more invasive then nuclear medicine-based<br>
approaches, and carries a higher risk (Refs. 17 to 21). EEG-<br>
neurological diagnosis has also been developed (Refs 22-25), but in<br>
this regard there remains a need for cheap instrumentation which<br>
can be used at the point of clinician contact.<br>
Neurofibrillary degeneration via brain atrophy - SPECT and PET<br>
Numerous studies have shown that global brain atrophy and specific<br>
medial temporal lobe atrophy, particularly of the hippocampus, are<br>
closely linked to underlying neurofibrillary degeneration of the<br>
Alzheimer-type, and are valuable in the early diagnosis of AD (Refs<br>
1-8) .<br>
However, although the diagnosis of AD by monitoring global, brain<br>
atrophy represents a methodology which can be made to work in a<br>
research setting, there are difficulties in defining and measuring<br>
atrophy in specific brain regions, and likewise in the measurement<br>
of global neocortical atrophy. In any case, a diagnosis based on<br>
detectable atrophy may come too late for effective treatment.<br>
There have been advances in diagnostic methodology in recent years,<br>
following the identification of diagnostic features in SPECT scans<br>
(Refs 9-12; characteristic patterns of perfusion defect detected by<br>
HMPAO SPECT), PET scans (Refs 13-15; metabolic defect detected by<br>
glucose metabolism profile) and MRI scans (Ref 16; global brain<br>
atrophy, specific patterns of lobar atrophy). Of these, the most<br>
generally accessible are MRI and SPECT, since PET is for the<br>
present time limited to centres which have local specialised<br>
cyclotron and radiochemistry capability for the preparation of<br>
short half-life injectable radioligands (Aberdeen, London,<br>
Cambridge in OK). Notably, the characteristic early stage temporo-<br>
parietal perfusion defect detected by HMPAO SPECT in patients with<br>
AD corresponds very closely to the pattern of tau pathology which<br>
can be detected biochemically (Figure 1). The biochemical changes<br>
precede overt neurofibrillary degeneration as seen by the<br>
appearance of NFTs (Figure 2; Mukaetova-Ladinska et al., 2000 Am.<br>
J- Pathol. Vol. 157, No. 2, 623-636) .<br>
However, although MRI and SPECT scans are useful for detecting<br>
specific patterns of perfusion defects characteristic of AD,<br>
discrimination between different neuropathological stages, or<br>
 between AD and other types of dementia, is difficult.<br>
For instance, SPECT is useful for detection of a specific pattern<br>
of bilateral temporo-parietal perfusion defect that is<br>
characteristic of AD (Refs 9 - 11), which can be useful even at<br>
 very early stage disease. However, SPECT changes discriminate<br>
neuropathological stages poorly (Ref 12). Furthermore,<br>
discrimination between AD and Lewy Body dementia is difficult. Both<br>
have a bilateral temporo-parietal perfusion defect, but only in the<br>
latter does an occipital perfusion defect tend to be present. The<br>
same patterns of defect can be demonstrated using PET measurement<br>
of glucose metabolism (Refs 13 - 15), but the problem of<br>
distinguishing Lewy Body dementia persists in this modality.<br>
Thus, as can be inferred from data in Ref 12, the probability of<br>
successful SPECT detection of cases at Braak stages 1&amp;2 is 50%, and<br>
at stages 3&amp;4 is 60%. It is only at stages 5&amp;6 that 95% of cases<br>
become SPBCT-positive. Conversely, cases detected as SPECT-positive<br>
could be at stages 1&amp;2 (20%), 3&amp;4 (20%), or 5&amp;6 (60%). SPECT will<br>
therefore fail to detect 40 - 50% of the pre-stage 4 target<br>
population for early diagnosis and therapeutic intervention. In a<br>
further study (data not shown) it was shown that overall agreement<br>
between SPECT diagnosis and clinical diagnosis was of the order of<br>
50%.<br>
Thus, in developing a treatment aimed specifically at preventing<br>
neurofibrillary degeneration of the Alzheimer-type, there is a<br>
critical need to develop, in parallel, non-invasive means of<br>
selecting patients for treatment, and monitoring their response to<br>
the treatment, according to a defined and reproducible definition<br>
of disease progression.<br>
Disclosure of the invention<br>
Brief summary of the Invention<br>
The present inventors have used immunochemical properties (Refs 26,<br>
27, 30) to distinguish intracellular tangles from extracellular<br>
 tangles. Both the frequency of cases with tangles in these<br>
categories (i.e. probability) and their quantity (i.e. counts per<br>
mm2) were determined in a prospective case series and grouped into<br>
the regions of the brain known to represent stages in the<br>
progression of pathology according to the system of Braak and<br>
 Braak.<br>
As described in more detail below, these antibody studies<br>
demonstrate for the first time that by employing extracellular vs.<br>
intracellular specificity, in defined brain regions, deposits of<br>
PHF-tau provide a basis for empirical staging of the<br>
neurofibrillary degeneration of AD.<br>
Thus in one aspect, the present invention provides a method for<br>
determining the stage of neurofibrillary degeneration associated<br>
with tauopathy (e.g. AD) in a subject believed to suffer from the<br>
disease, which method comprises the steps of:<br>
(i) introducing into the subject a ligand capable of labelling<br>
aggregated PHF tau,<br>
(ii) determining the presence and\or amount of ligand bound to<br>
extracellular aggregated PHF tau in the medial temporal lobe of the<br>
brain of the subject,<br>
(iii) correlating the result of the determination made in (ii) with<br>
the extent of neurofibrillary degeneration in the subject.<br>
As described in the introduction, progression of neurofibrillary<br>
degeneration is definitive of the neuropathological staging<br>
proposed by Braak, which in turn is the best available<br>
neuropathological definition of progression of AD. The methods of<br>
the present invention can thus be used to provide an actual Braak<br>
stage result. In preferred embodiments they can be used to<br>
diagnose patients at early Braak stages (e.g. Braak stage 2) even<br>
before clinical symptoms may be readily apparent - such diagnosis<br>
can be used to direct timely treatment and advice.<br>
Interestingly, results shown in Gertz et al. (1996) loc cit, based<br>
on immunological detection of NFTs, but which did not distinguish<br>
extracellular and intracellular tangles, showed little difference<br>
between the numbers detected in demented (generally Braak stage 4-<br>
. 6) and non-demented (generally Braak stage 1-3) subjects in medial<br>
temporal lobe structures (see Figure 1 and Table 2, page 134<br>
therein; the relevant structures are labelled Pre alpha ent., CAl,<br>
Pri Ento.). Thus the correlation demonstrated by the present<br>
invention is particularly surprising.<br>
The invention further provides novel ligands for use in labelling<br>
tau aggregates, plus also novel screens for discovering such<br>
Some of the aspects of the invention discussed above will now be<br>
dealt with in more detail.<br>
Choice of subject<br>
Suitable subjects for the method may be selected on the basis of<br>
conventional factors. Thus the initial selection of a patient may<br>
involve any one or more of: rigorous evaluation by experienced<br>
clinician; exclusion of non-AD diagnosis as far as possible by<br>
supplementary laboratory and other investigations; objective<br>
evaluation of level of cognitive function using neuropathologically<br>
validated battery.<br>
Ligands<br>
The ligand is capable of labelling aggregated PHF tau, the<br>
formation of which is discussed above. It may specifically or<br>
preferentially bind such tau (preferentially with respect to<br>
competing binding sites present in the relevant region of the<br>
brain) . Suitable ligands (including novel liganda) and methods of<br>
identifying them are discussed below.<br>
More specifically, the disclosure that Braak staging can be<br>
assessed on the basis described herein has significant implications<br>
for the choice and\or development of ligands for use in diagnostic<br>
labelling. Immunological methods suffer from the drawback that<br>
antibodies do not readily cross the blood-brain barrier in a<br>
quantitative manner, and furthermore, the method may be clinically,<br>
unsuitable since adverse reactions may be triggered by the<br>
injection of antibodies into the body for this purpose. It is<br>
consequently difficult to discriminate between different stages of<br>
tau aggregation on the basis of differential patterns of<br>
immunoreactivity in living subjects.<br>
The present inventors have therefore investigated the critical<br>
chemical characteristics of compounds which bind to neurofibrillary<br>
tangles. They provide herein a minimal chemical structure required<br>
for binding which has implications, Inter alia, in the development<br>
and use of compounds as ligands of neurofibrillary tangles and such<br>
processes, uses and compounds form further aspects of the<br>
invention.<br>
Preferred ligands, including novel ligands, are disclosed in more<br>
detail hereinafter, but may include in particular sulphonated-<br>
benzothiazole-like compounds (see e.g. Figure 4a) and<br>
diaminophenothiazines (see e.g. Figure 8) as veil as other mimetic<br>
compounds sharing an appropriate minimal chemical structure with<br>
either of these. Compositions comprising, or consisting of,<br>
combinations of the ligands disclosed herein (preferably<br>
distinguishable ligands e.g. in terms of labelling) and\or<br>
combinations of ligands with blocking agents (see below) form<br>
various aspects of the invention.<br>
Binding to extracellular tau<br>
The determination of (ii) above is made based on extracellular<br>
aggregated tau. In general terms, for the purposes of the present<br>
invention, this may be determined from extracellular tangles (see<br>
e.g. Refs 26, 27 and Examples, Methods and Materials, Table) .<br>
It has previously been shown from histological studies that, during<br>
the course of aggregation, tau protein acquires binding sites for<br>
compounds such as thiazin red and thioflavin-S (Refs 26, 27). The<br>
binding site can be shown to exist within the tangle itself, and<br>
not in extraneous proteins (Ref 34) . Thus both intracellular and<br>
extracellular tangles are labelled to some extent by such ligands,<br>
as judged histologically.<br>
In general terms, the probability or amount of extracellular<br>
binding sites (as opposed to total binding sites, or intracellular<br>
 sites) may be determined either by using ligands which are too<br>
large to gain ready intracellular access, or ligands which can act<br>
intracellularly, but at a defined (relatively lower) concentration<br>
at which extracellular action is favoured.<br>
Large chelated liganda, such as those susceptible to detection by<br>
SPECT, could be expected to at least reach and bind appropriate<br>
extracellular targets. Compounds labelled directly for PET could<br>
potentially detect both intracellular or extracellular targets,<br>
with the latter being favoured at low concentration. Thus the work<br>
of the present inventors shows that both of these detection methods<br>
have potential in Braak staging, when used with an appropriate<br>
tangle-binding ligand. Nevertheless, in the light of the present<br>
disclosure, it will be appreciated that in order to conveniently<br>
assess Braak stage via NET numbers it may be important to employ<br>
ligands which are not only capable of crossing the blood brain<br>
barrier and labelling specified extracellular or intracellular<br>
deposits of aggregated tau, but preferably can also retain this<br>
property when conjugated to further compounds.<br>
However, for the avoidance of doubt, ligands may be visualised or<br>
detected by any suitable means, and the skilled person will<br>
appreciate that any suitable detection means as is known in the art<br>
could be substituted for these examples.<br>
Enhancement of preferential tau binding<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, steps (i) and\or (ii) of the<br>
method are performed in conjunction with (preferably preceded by)<br>
the further step of introducing into the subject a second ligand<br>
which labels competing (i.e. non-aggregated tau) binding sites<br>
present in the relevant region of the brain preferentially to the<br>
first ligand.<br>
Thus the methods and other embodiments herein may include a step:<br>
(ibis) introducing into the subject a blocking ligand which labels<br>
non-aggregated tau binding sites in the brain of the subject<br>
preferentially to the ligand capable of labelling aggregated PHF<br>
tau.<br>
A competing binding site may be one which is provided by e.g.<br>
amyloid plaques, such as may be present in the subject. By<br>
introducing such second ligands into the subject, the relative or<br>
effective concentration of first ligand available to bind to<br>
aggregated tau may be enhanced. Suitable second ligands (or<br>
blocking compounds as they may be described herein) are described<br>
below, but they may in particular include benzthiazoles such as are<br>
shown in Figure 5, compounds IB and 2. Another suitable blocking<br>
ligand may be FDDNP of Shoghi-Jadid et al., Am. J. Geriatr.<br>
Psychiatr. 2002, 10:24-35, discussed above.<br>
Brain regions<br>
The significance of the medial temporal lobe i.e. E2/Trans<br>
(Bntorhinal cortex layer 2/transitional entorhinal cortex) and<br>
E4/BC (Entorhinal cortex layer 4 and hippocampus) regions, and also<br>
neocortical structures (F/T/P regions - frontal, temporal,<br>
parietal) of the brain are demonstrated in Figures 25, 27, and 29.<br>
In one embodiment, the method comprises only analysing the data<br>
based on extracellular NFTs in the medial temporal lobe.<br>
If a further embodiment, both this region and the neocortical<br>
structure data is assessed. In the latter case it may be preferable<br>
to assess intracellular PHF deposits.<br>
Thus the methods and other embodiments herein may include a further<br>
step:<br>
(lib) additionally determining the presence and\or amount of ligand<br>
bound to intracellular aggregated PHF tau in a neocortical<br>
structure of the brain of the subject,<br>
This may be followed by:<br>
(iii) correlating the result of the determination made in (ii) and<br>
optionally (iib) with the extent of neurofibriliary degeneration in<br>
the subject, and hence the AD state of the subject.<br>
The ligand used for intracellular labelling may in principle be the<br>
same as that used for extracellular labelling, but preferably will<br>
be different and\or labelled distinctively (such that it can be<br>
distinguished by whatever imaging process is being used).<br>
The additional steps may be particularly preferred for assessing or<br>
confirming neurofibrillary degeneration in subjects at Braak stage<br>
2-6.<br>
Determination of neurofibrillary degeneration<br>
The determination may be of the presence of binding in a given<br>
area. This determination can then be related to a normal range of<br>
values for cases without any pathology (i.e. cases putatively at<br>
Braak Stage 1), or ranges of reference values which have been<br>
determined for successive Braak stages to determine the<br>
neuropathological stage corresponding to the given determination.<br>
The correlation may be done by means of a look-up table or graph,<br>
e.g. based on data corresponding to the Figures and Table 1 in<br>
Example 1 herein for density. Alternatively, a given determination<br>
may be related with reference to a given threshold value to a<br>
probability of a case being at a Stage more advanced that Stage 1<br>
(e.g. based on data corresponding to the Figures herein for<br>
probability), and thereby giving a probability of correctly<br>
attributing a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease..<br>
Uses of the method<br>
The determination may be as part of a method of diagnosis or<br>
prognosis. It may be used to select a patient for treatment, or to<br>
assess the effectiveness of a treatment or a therapeutic e.g. an<br>
inhibitor of tau-tau association administered to the subject.<br>
Thus embodiments of the invention include:<br>
A ligand which is capable of labelling extracellular aggregated PHF<br>
tau for use in a method of diagnosis or prognosis of AD in a<br>
subject believed to suffer from the disease, which method comprises<br>
the steps of:<br>
(1) introducing into the subject a ligand capable of labelling<br>
aggregated PHF tau,<br>
(ii) determining the presence and\or amount of ligand bound to<br>
extracellular aggregated PHP tau in the of the medial temporal lobe<br>
of the brain of the subject,<br>
(iii) correlating the result of the determination made in (ii) with<br>
the extent of neurofibrillary degeneration in the subject, and<br>
hence the AD state of the subject.<br>
Use of a ligand which is capable of labelling extracellular<br>
aggregated PHF tau in a method for preparing a diagnostic or<br>
prognostic reagent suitable for use in a method of determining the<br>
stage of neurofibrillary degeneration associated with AD in 3<br>
subject believed to suffer from the disease, which method comprises<br>
the steps of:<br>
(i) introducing into the subject said reagent which is capable of<br>
labelling aggregated PHF tau,<br>
(ii) determining the presence and\or amount of the reagent bound to<br>
extracellular aggregated PHF tau in the medial temporal lobe of the<br>
brain of the subject,<br>

the extent of neurofibrillary degeneration in the subject.<br>
In a still further aspect, the invention provides a kit for<br>
performing the uses and methods described above, the kit comprising<br>
one or more ligands or derivatives as provided herein, which are<br>
capable of binding to the aggregated molecules. It may include<br>
means for increasing the detectability of such compounds e.g. a<br>
technetium chelating group, plus optionally means to conjugate this<br>
to the ligand, plus optionally technetium. Where the kit comprises<br>
a derivative of a compound as disclosed herein, this may be e.g.<br>
fluoroscopically detectable, as discussed elsewhere in this<br>
description. The kit may also include means for detecting or<br>
visualising the ligand, e.g. where the ligand has an incorporated<br>
biotin group, the kit preferably includes an antibiotin antibody.<br>
Similarly, the kit may include means for detecting the inherent<br>
fluorescence of a compound, means for detecting photoactivatable<br>
groups, further labelled antibodies, etc.<br>
Various preferred ligands for use in the methods and other<br>
embodiments of the present invention will now be discussed in more<br>
detail. In each case, those skilled in the art will appreciate that<br>
instead of administering ligands directly, they could be<br>
administered in a precursor form, for conversion to the active form<br>
by an activating agent present in, or administered to, the same<br>
subject.<br>
Sulphonated-benzothiazole-like ligands<br>

The bicyclic group, comprising W, X, Y, and Z, may be denoted the<br>
"core group." When each of X, Y, and Z is CH, and W is S, the<br>
compound may be referred to as a benzothiazole compound, and may be<br>
considered to have, as a core group, a benzothiazole group. The<br>

A preferred ligand for use in this aspect of the present invention<br>
is a ligand compound of the formula (I):<br>
wherein:<br>
M1 is an alkali metal cation;<br>
RL is a rigid linker group;<br>
Ar1 is an C5-2oaryl group;<br>
n is an integer from 0 to 3; and,<br>
each RBT is a independently benzothiazole substituent.<br>

substantially planar. In addition, the rigid linker group, RL, and<br>
the aryl group, Ar1, together with the core group (e.g.,<br>
benzothiazole group), form a compound which is substantially<br>
planar. By "substantially planar," it is meant that the<br>
moiety/compound has a high degree of planarity e.g. less than 5, 4,<br>

standard chemical models and assumptions. Preferably the twist<br>
will be no greater than that of the compound of Figure 16.<br>

characteristics described above may be particularly suitable for<br>
the 'Braak staging' methods of the invention. Such compounds may<br>
be known in the art, or may be novel as described in more detail<br>
below.<br>
The "compound length" is the distance between the two most distant<br>
aromatic ring atoms (denoted "reference atoms"). For example, for<br>
benzothiazole compounds, at the benzothiazole "end" of the<br>
molecule, the reference atom will be one of two atoms:<br>
At the aryl "end" of the molecule, when Ar1 is an aryl group having<br>
a phenyl core (see below), the reference atom will be one of three<br>
atoms:<br>

In one embodiment, the ligand is a compound as described below<br>
under the heading "Preferred sulphonated-benzothiazole-like<br>
ligands."<br>
Compounds of the type described above, e.g. of formula (I), for use<br>
in the diagnostic methods of the present invention, may be prepared<br>
my conventional means - see e.g. Reference 31.<br>
All such compounds described herein (or derivatives thereof) having<br>
the appropriate formula, size, planarity, and activity may be<br>
referred to generally, but not limitatively, hereinafter as<br>
'sulphonated benzothiazole-like compounds' or *SB ligands'). Such<br>
compounds will generally be ligands of aggregated tau molecules,<br>
e.g. those found in paired helical filaments or neurofibrillary<br>
tangles.<br>
The ligands described herein can suitably be detected by<br>
incorporating a positron-emitting carbon into one of the methyl<br>
groups of the compound as disclosed herein, and detecting the<br>
compound by use of positron emission tomography (PET) as is known<br>
in the art. Alternatively, or in addition, a technetium-containing<br>
chelate can be incorporated into the compound (e.g. as in the Rc<br>
group of the compounds described herein), so that selective<br>
detection of extracellular tangles could be achieved. A preferred<br>
chelating group is Rc diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid.<br>
The ligands may be conjugated, chelated, or otherwise associated,<br>
with other chemical groups, dyes, fluorescent markers, antigenic<br>
groups, therapeutic moieties, or any other entity which may aid in<br>
a prognostic, diagnostic or therapeutic application. For instance,<br>
where the ligand is attached to a dye or fluorescent group, the<br>
conjugate can be used as a label of aggregated tau or tau-like<br>
molecules. It can thus be used to label intracellular or<br>
extracellular tangles characteristic of AD.<br>
Phenothlazlnes<br>
The present inventors have previously identified another class of<br>
compounds, members of which disrupt the structure of PHFs, and<br>
reverse the proteolytic stability of the PHF core (WO 96/30766) .<br>
Diaminophenothiazine compounds described in HO 96/30766 are shown<br>
by the structures of Figure 8a. Formula (IV) in Figure 8a<br>
represents different resonance form of (II) included for clarity.<br>
Compounds (II)-(IV) are all oxidised forms while (I) is a reduced<br>
form. Such compounds (which may be referred to hereinafter as<br>
'diaminophenothiazines' or 'phenothiazines') include, e.g. tolonium<br>
chloride and methylene blue. Examples are shown in Figure 8b. All<br>
of these are shown in the oxidised form, with all except thionine<br>
being in the form stabilised salts (thionine is shown as a neutral<br>
oxidised form).<br>
Compounds which may be used in the methods described herein may be<br>
any having a formula shown in Figure 8a, wherein:<br>
each of R1, R3, R4, R4, R7 and R9 is independently hydrogen,<br>
halogen, hydroxy, carboxy, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl,<br>
haloalkyl or alkoxy;<br>
R5 is hydrogen, hydroxy, carboxy, substituted or unsubstituted<br>
alkyl, haloalkyl or alkoxy; and,<br>
R10 and R11 are independently hydrogen, hydroxy, carboxy,<br>
substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, haloalkyl or alkoxy;<br>
and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.<br>
In one embodiment:<br>
each of R11 R3/ R4, R4, R7 and R4 is independently hydrogen,<br>
halogen, hydroxy, carboxy, substituted or unsubstituted C1-6alkyl,<br>
C1-4haloalkyl, or C1-6alkoxy;<br>
R5 is independently hydrogen, hydroxy, carboxy, substituted or<br>
unsubstituted C1-6alkyl, C1-4haloalkyl, or C1-4alkoxy;<br>
R10 and R11 are independently selected from hydrogen, hydroxy,<br>
carboxy, substituted or unsubstituted C1-4alkyl, C1-4haloalkyl, or<br>
C1-4alkoxy.<br>
The term "alkyl" as used in this respect refers to straight or<br>
branched chain groups, preferably having one to eight, more<br>
preferably one to six, carbon atoms. For example, "alkyl" may<br>
refer to methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, sec-<br>
butyl, tert-butyl, pentyl, isopentyl, tert-pentyl, hexyl, isohexyl,<br>
and the like. Suitable substituents for the substituted alkyl<br>
groups used in the invention include the mercapto, thioether,<br>
nitro, amino, aryloxy, halogen, hydroxyl, and carbonyl groups as<br>
well as aryl, cycloalkyl and noft-aryl heterocyclic groups.<br>
The terms "alkoxy" refers to groups as defined herein above as<br>
alkyl groups, as the case may be, which also carry an oxygen atom<br>
interposed between them and the substrate residue to which they are<br>
attached.<br>
The term "haloalkyl" represents a straight or branched alkyl chain<br>
having from one to four carbon atoms with 1, 2 or 3 halogen atoms<br>
attached to it. Typical haloalkyl groups include chloromethy 1, 2-<br>
bromethyl, 1-chloroisopropyl, 3-fluoropropyl, 2,3-dibrombutyl, 3-<br>
chloroisobutyl, iodo-t-butyl, trifluoromethyl and the like.<br>
The "halogen" represents fluoro, chloro, bromo or iodo.<br>
Some of these phenothiazines possess one or more asymmetrically<br>
substituted carbon atoms and therefore exist in racemic and<br>
optically active forms. The invention is intended to encompass the<br>
racemic forms of the compounds as well a.s any of the optically<br>
active forms thereof.<br>
Acid addition salts may be formed between basic compounds of Figure<br>
8a or 8b and inorganic acids, e.g. hydrohalic acids such as<br>
hydrochloric acid and hydrobromic acid, sulphuric acid, nitric<br>
acid, phosphoric acid etc., or organic acid, e.g. acetic acid,<br>
citric acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid,<br>
methanesulphonic acid, p-toluenesulphonic acid etc.<br>
In a particular preferred embodiment the present invention employs<br>
a phenothiazine wherein:<br>
Rir Rsr Ro R«/ R? and R9 are independently -H, -CH3, -C2HS, or -C3H7;<br>
Rio and R11 are independently -H, -CH3, -C2H5 or -C3H7;<br>
Rs is -H, -CH3, -C2H5, or -C3H7;<br>
or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.<br>
The present inventors now teach herein that such phenothiazine<br>
compounds of this sort can bind to the PHFs at a specific site<br>
which appears, on the basis of its binding characteristics, to be<br>
distinct from that at which the sulphonated benzothiazole-like<br>
compounds, described above, can bind. The binding of the<br>
phenothiazine compounds to this site is thought to effect the<br>
inhibition of tau aggregation.<br>
Phenothiazine compounds may be used in the methods and other<br>
embodiments described above, incorporating labels as appropriate.<br>
When suitably labeled with a positron-emitting functional group<br>
(detectable by PET - see Figures 11, lib, 12, 13) such compounds<br>
would serve as ligands for all tau aggregates, and would be capable<br>
of crossing the blood-brain-barrier (Ref 36) and entering cells.<br>
In a further embodiment, in the light of the disclosure herein, it<br>
will be appreciated that the effect of, and particularly the<br>
progress of, therapy based on tau-tau binding inhibitors may be<br>
monitorable by use of SB ligands.<br>
wherein:<br>
n is an integer from 0 to 4;<br>

substituent;<br>

Preferred embodiments of blocking ligands are shown in Figure 5 as<br>
Preferred sulphonated-benzothiazole-like ligands<br>
In one aspect of the present invention, the ligands used to label<br>
the aggregated tau, preferable extracellular aggregated tau present<br>
in NFTs, are compounds having the formula (II):<br>
wherein:<br>
M1 is an alkali metal cation;<br>
n is an integer from 0 to 3;<br>
each RBT is a independently benzothiazole substituent;<br>
m is an integer from 0 to 4;<br>
each RRL is independently a rigid linker aryl substituent;<br>
s is an integer from 0 to 4;<br>
each RA is independently an aryl substituent; and,<br>
Rc, if present, is a reactive conjugating substituent, or<br>
Rc is, or contains, a detectable label.<br>
In various embodiments, M1, n, each RBT, each RRL, s, each RA, and Rc<br>
are as described herein (e.g., under the heading "Sulphonated-<br>
benzothiazole-like ligands," above).<br>
The rigid linker group, RL, and the aryl group, Ar1, together with<br>
the benzothiazole group, form a compound which is substantially<br>
planar, that is, has a high degree of planarity.<br>
As shown herein, such compounds may be particularly effective when<br>
it is desired to incorporate a bulky Rc group in order to facilitate<br>
detection.<br>
In various embodiments, s may be as discussed above.<br>
In one embodiment, each RA is independently selected from the<br>
substituents given above in relation to formula (I).<br>
Some of these preferred compounds are shown in Figures 4a-c, and<br>
derivatives thereof.<br>
Thus, according to one aspect, the present invention provides a<br>
compound represented by the formula shown in Figure 4a, or a<br>
derivative thereof e.g. wherein Rcis a conjugating group as<br>
described above. As shown in the Examples hereinafter, such<br>
derivatives (e.g. compound 4b) retain the appropriate binding<br>
activity.<br>
The novel compounds disclosed (e.g. of formula (II) ) herein are<br>
useful inter alia as synthetic ligands of neurofibrillary tangles,<br>
such as those characteristic of AD. The discovery of the minimum<br>
critical structure required for binding to these tangles thus<br>
provides for the possibility of designing high-affinity ligands<br>
which can be used to target the tangles, and can thus be used in<br>
the diagnosis, prognosis or treatment of diseases such as AD.<br>
Such compounds will be referred to below as preferred SB ligands.<br>
Mimetics of preferred SB ligands<br>
In general, there are several steps commonly taken in the design of<br>
a mimetic from, a compound having a given target property (in this<br>
case a preferred SB tau-tau aggregation ligand) of which the most<br>
important is that the particular parts of the compound that are<br>
critical and/or important in determining the target property are<br>
determined. The provision by the present inventors of the minimum<br>
critical structure required for high affinity binding to aggregated<br>
tau molecules has obviated this step.<br>
The minimum critical structure of compound 4a can be modeled<br>
according to its physical properties, e.g. stereochemistry,<br>
bonding, size and/or charge, using data from a range of sources,<br>
e.g. spectroscopic techniques, X-ray diffraction data and NMR.<br>
Computational analysis, similarity mapping (which models the charge<br>
and/or volume of the ligand, rather than the bonding between atoms)<br>
and other techniques can be used in this modeling process.<br>
In a variant of this approach, the three-dimensional structure of<br>
the preferred SB ligand and its binding partner are modeled. This<br>
can be especially useful where the ligand and/or binding partner<br>
change conformation on binding, allowing the model to take account<br>
of this in the design of the mimetic. A template molecule is then<br>
selected onto which chemical groups which mimic the minimum<br>
critical structure can be grafted. The template molecule and the<br>
 chemical groups grafted on to it can conveniently be selected so<br>
that the mimetic is easy to synthesise, is likely to be<br>
pharmacologically acceptable, and does not degrade in vivo, while<br>
retaining the required biological activity. The mimetic or<br>
mimetics found by this approach can then be screened to see whether<br>
 they have the target property, or to what extent they exhibit it.<br>
Further optimisation or modification can then be carried out to<br>
arrive at one or more final mimetics for further testing or<br>
optimisation, e.g. in vivo or clinical testing. Optimisation may<br>
include selecting a mimetic compound as described above, and<br>
 contacting it with a preparation of aggregated tau molecules (e.g.<br>
preaggregated tau in solution, or bound to a solid phase, or<br>
isolated from PHFs - see WO96/30766 and assays described below) and<br>
determining the extent to which the test substance (s) binds to the<br>
aggregated tau molecules and\or displaces compound 4a from the<br>
molecules.<br>
Methods of labelling aggregated tau<br>
In one aspect, the present invention thus provides a method of<br>
labelling aggregated tau or tau-like molecules, comprising<br>
contacting the aggregated tau molecules with a preferred SB-ligand<br>
compound or derivative thereof as provided herein (e.g. of formula<br>
(II)) and detecting the presence of said compound or derivative.<br>
Methods of use may be performed e.g. by analogy to the use of the<br>
Uganda given in Refs 26-34.<br>
Where used herein, the term "tau protein" refers generally to any<br>
protein of the tau protein family. Tau proteins are characterised<br>
as being one among a larger number of protein families which co-<br>
purify with microtubules during repeated cycles of assembly and<br>
disassembly (Shelanski et al. (1973) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA,<br>
70., 765-768), and are known as microtubule-associated-proteins<br>
(MAPs) . Members of the tau family share the common features of<br>
having a characteristic N-terminal segment, sequences of<br>
approximately 50 amino acids inserted in the N-terminal segment,<br>
which are developmentally regulated in the brain, a characteristic<br>
tandem repeat region consisting of 3 or 4 tandem repeats of 31-32<br>
amino acids, and a C-terminal tail.<br>
"Tau like" molecules include, for instance, MAP2, which is the<br>
predominant microtubule-associated protein in the somatodendritic<br>
compartment (Matus, A., in "Microtubules" [Hyams and Lloyd, eds.]<br>
pp 155-166, John Wiley and Sons, NY). MAP2 isoforms are almost<br>
identical to tau protein in the tandem repeat region, but differ<br>
substantially both in the sequence and extent of the N-terminal<br>
domain (Kindler and Garner (1994) Mol. Brain Res. 26, 218-224).<br>
Nevertheless, aggregation in the tandem-repeat region is not<br>
selective for the tau repeat domain. Thus it will be appreciated<br>
that any discussion herein in relation to tau protein or tau-tau<br>
aggregation should be taken as relating also to tau-MAP2<br>
aggregation, MAP2-MAP2 aggregation and so on.<br>
The preferred SB ligand may be conjugated, chelated, or otherwise<br>
associated with, a further group or entity which has a diagnostic,<br>
prognostic or therapeutic purpose or effect, e.g. to a fluorescent<br>
group which thus enables visualisation of neurofibrillary tangles<br>
to which the ligand binds.<br>
Diagnostic compositions and uses<br>
Generally, a preferred SB ligand according to the present invention<br>
(e.g. of formula (II)) nay be provided in an isolated and/or<br>
purified form, i.e. substantially pure. This may include being in<br>
a composition where it represents at least about 90% active<br>
ingredient, more preferably at least about 95%, more preferably at<br>
least about 98%. Such a composition may, however, include inert<br>
carrier materials or other pharmaceutically- and physiologically-<br>
acceptable excipients. A composition according to the present<br>
invention may include in addition to a preferred SB ligand as<br>
disclosed herein, one or more other molecules of diagnostic,<br>
prognostic or therapeutic use.<br>
A preferred SB ligand substance according to the present invention,<br>
or a composition comprising such .a ligand, may be provided for use<br>
in a method of diagnosis, prognosis or treatment of the human or<br>
animal body by therapy, especially in relation to a condition such<br>
as AD as described below.<br>
In a further aspect, the present invention provides a method of<br>
diagnosis or prognosis, the method comprising administering to the<br>
mammal a diagnostically- or prognostically- effective amount of one<br>
or more preferred SB ligands as described herein. This aspect<br>
embraces such compounds for use in a method of diagnosis or<br>
prognosis. Both in vitro and in vivo uses are encompassed by this<br>
aspect. In vitro methods may be performed by (i) obtaining a sample<br>
of appropriate tissue from a subject; (ii) contacting the sample<br>
with the preferred SB ligand; (iii) detecting the amount and\or<br>
localisation of the preferred SB ligand bound to the sample (iv)<br>
correlating the result of (v) with the stage or severity of the<br>
disease in the subject.<br>
In a further aspect/ the present invention provides the use of a<br>
preferred SB ligand or derivative as provided herein, in the<br>
manufacture of a composition for the diagnosis, prognosis or<br>
therapy of a disease as described above.<br>
The disease or condition may be e.g. AD, or an AD-like condition,<br>
or any other condition in which aggregated protein molecules are<br>
implicated.<br>
Notably it is not only Alzheimer's Disease in which tau protein<br>
(and aberrant function or processing thereof) may play a role. The<br>
pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders such as Pick's disease<br>
and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) appears to correlate with<br>
an accumulation of pathological truncated tau aggregates in the<br>
dentate gyrus and stellate pyramidal cells of the neocortex,<br>
respectively. Other dementias include fronto-temporal dementia<br>
(FTD); parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17);<br>
disinhibition-dementia-parkinsonism-amyotrophy complex (DDPAC) ;<br>
pallido-ponto-nigral degeneration (PPND); Guam-ALS syndrome;<br>
pallido-nigro-luysian degeneration (PNLD); cortico-basal<br>
degeneration (CBD) and others (see Wischik et al. 2000, loc. cit,<br>
for detailed discussion - especially Table 5.1). All of these<br>
diseases, which are characterized primarily or partially by<br>
abnormal tau aggregation, are referred to herein as "tauopathies".<br>
Diagnostic compositions may comprise, in addition to one of the<br>
above SB-ligand derivatives, a diagnosticly acceptable excipient,<br>
carrier, buffer, stabiliser, or other materials well known to those<br>
skilled in the art. Such materials should be non-toxic and should<br>
not interfere with the binding activity of the substance to<br>
aggregated tau, or the efficacy of any bioactiye group linked to or<br>
otherwise associated with the substance. The precise nature of the<br>
carrier or other material may depend on the route of<br>
administration, e.g. oral, intravenous, cutaneous or subcutaneous,<br>
nasal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal routes.<br>
Diagnostic compositions for oral administration nay be in tablet,<br>
capsule/ powder or liquid form. A tablet, may include a solid<br>
carrier such as gelatin or an adjuvant. Liquid diagnostic<br>
compositions generally include a liquid carrier such as water,<br>
petroleum, animal or vegetable oils, mineral oil or synthetic oil.<br>
Physiological saline solution, dextrose or other saccharide<br>
solution or glycols such as ethylene glycol, propylene glycol or<br>
polyethylene glycol may be included.<br>
For intravenous, cutaneous or subcutaneous injection, or injection<br>
at the site of affliction, the ligand will be in the form of a<br>
parenterally acceptable aqueous solution which is pyrogen-free and<br>
has suitable pH, isotonicity and stability. Those of relevant<br>
skill in the art are well able to prepare suitable solutions using,<br>
for example, isotonic vehicles such as Sodium Chloride Injection,<br>
Ringer's Injection, Lactated Ringer's Injection. Preservatives,<br>
stabilisers, buffers, antioxidants and/or other additives may be<br>
included, as required.<br>
A composition as described above may be administered alone or in<br>
combination with other treatments, either simultaneously or<br>
sequentially, depending on the condition to be treated.<br>
Identification of Uganda<br>
A further method for identifying ligands for aggregated tau<br>
requires a screening assay which can be used in a format which<br>
permits high through-put screening of chemical libraries to<br>
identify compounds with the required activity. Dntil now, no such<br>
 method has been readily available. Preferred methods would not<br>
require pre-labelled compounds, since the labelling process may<br>
severely limit chemical search capacity.<br>
In a further aspect of the present invention a method is provided<br>
 which can be used as a high through-put screening assay, which is<br>
not limited by the need to have pre-labelled test substances. In<br>
preferred embodiments the method employs the following steps:<br>
1. the high capacity generation of tau proteins in a form which<br>
have undergone partial aggregation in the course of preparation;<br>
2. using tau proteins prepared in this manner for testing putative<br>
ligands in the tau-tau binding assay provided in WO96/30766 to<br>
identify substances which have minimal or entirely absent activity<br>
as tau-aggregation inhibitors or enhance tau-tau binding at high<br>
concentrations;<br>
3. testing putative ligands in the presence of an exemplary potent<br>
tau-aggregation inhibitor, such as DMMB, at an inhibitory<br>
concentration;<br>
4. putative ligands can be identified by the property that they<br>
lack capacity to block tau-tau binding through the repeat domain,<br>
but block the inhibitory activity of a potent tau-aggregation<br>
inhibitor.<br>
Thus the invention provides an in vitxo method for identifying a<br>
ligand capable of labeling aggregated PHF tau protein, the method<br>
comprising the steps of:<br>
(i) providing a first agent suspected of being capable of labeling<br>
aggregated PHF tau protein,<br>
(ii) contacting (a) a tau protein or a derivative thereof<br>
containing the tau core fragment bound to a solid phase so as to<br>
expose a high affinity tau capture site (e.g. a truncated tau<br>
protein corresponding to the core fragment and terminating at<br>
Ala390 - dGA), with (b) a liquid phase tau protein or derivative<br>
thereof capable of binding to the solid phase tau protein or<br>
derivative (e.g. dGAE which terminates at Glu-391), and (c) said<br>
selected first agent and (d) a second agent known to be tau-tau<br>
binding inhibitor,<br>
(iii) selecting a first agent which fully or partially relieves the<br>
inhibition of binding of the liquid phase tau protein or derivative<br>
of (b) to the solid phase tau protein or derivative of (a) by the<br>
inhibitor (d).<br>
Agents satisfying (iii) may be provided as ligands.<br>
Preferably the method is carried out in conjunction with (before,<br>
during, after) the following steps:<br>
(ibis) contacting (a) a tau protein or a derivative thereof<br>
containing the tau core fragment bound to a solid phase so as to<br>
expose a high affinity tau capture site, (b) a liquid phase tau<br>
protein or derivative thereof capable of binding to the solid phase<br>
tau protein or derivative, with (c) said first agent and,<br>
(iJbis.l) detecting inhibition of tau-tau binding as exhibited by<br>
inhibition of binding of the liquid phase tau protein or derivative<br>
of (b) to the solid phase tau protein or derivative of (a),<br>
(iJbis.2) selecting a first agent which has minimal or absent<br>
activity as tau-tau binding inhibitors and\or optionally enhance<br>
tau-tau binding.<br>
Agents satisfying (iii) and (ibis.2) may be provided as ligands.<br>
The inhibitor is preferably a diaminophenathiozine as described<br>
above (most preferably DMHB) . The compounds selected for screening<br>
may be any compound, including SB-ligands.<br>
In preferred forms the liquid phase tau protein or derivative is<br>
prepared in a form which has undergone partial aggregation prior to<br>
exposure to the solid phase. Apart from that, the assay may be<br>
carried out broadly as described in WO96/30766 and summarised in<br>
more detail in the Examples below. Preferably alkaline or<br>
physiological conditions (e.g. PBS) are used for the binding steps,<br>
and results are detected immunologically.<br>
These and other aspects of the present invention will become more<br>
apparent on reading the ensuing non-limiting Examples, in which<br>
embodiments of the invention will be described by way of example<br>
only. Reference is made to the accompanying figures, in which:<br>
Brief description of the [Figures <br>
Figure 1 shows the regional distribution of PHF-tau, measured using<br>
antibodies mAb423 (A) or mAb7.51 after formic acid treatment of the<br>
PHF fraction (B), for 18 cases of AD. Taken from Mukaetova-Ladinska<br>
et al., (1993), Am. J. Pathol. 143, 565-578.<br>
Figure 2 (a) shows the aggregation of tau molecules and the<br>
appearance of neurofibrillary tangles during the pathological<br>
stages of AD. Taken from (Mukaetova-Ladinska, E.B. et al. (2000)<br>
Am. J. Pathol. Vol. 157, No. 2, 623-636); (b) shows the<br>
neuropathological staging proposed by Braak; (c) shows that the<br>
appearance of clinical dementia by DSM-IV criteria appears to<br>
correspond statistically to the transition between stages III and<br>
IV; '<br>
(d) shows levels of SDS-insoluble beta-amyloid protein isolated<br>
from control cases and cases with Alzheimer's disease, as<br>
reportedin Harrington et al., (Am J Pathol 1994; 145: 1472-1484).<br>
Although the mean level is higher in AD than in controls, 70% of AD<br>
cases overlap with levels of beta-amyloid found in control<br>
subjects. <br>
Figure 3 shows a schematic representation of a neurofibrillary<br>
tangle (top), and the immunoreactivity changes that are observed<br>
during disease progression (bottom). Taken from Bondareff et al.<br>
(1994) J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 53, 2, 158-164.<br>
Figure 4 shows the chemical structures of: the minimum critical<br>
structure which enables high affinity binding to aggregated tau<br>
molecules (compound 4a); a biotinylated version of compound 4a<br>
(compound 4b); and an R-substituted derivative of compound 4a<br>
(compound 4c), wherein R is any suitable substituent.<br>
Figure 5 shows the chemical structures of: primulin (compound la);<br>
thioflavin-T (compound lb); 2-(4-amino phenyl)-6-methyl-7-<br>
sulphonate benzothiazole (compound 2); thiazin red (compound 3a);<br>
and thiazin yellow (compound 3b).<br>
Figure 6 shows the fluorescence peaks of primulin in solution<br>
(left), and when bound within a pure preparation of PHFs (right).<br>
Figure 7 shows the fluorescence peaks of primulin bound to PHFs, in<br>
the absence (left) and presence (right) of citraconic anhydride.<br>
As is shown, citraconic anhydride has the effect of disrupting the<br>
orderly structure of PHFs and releasing free tau and free unbound<br>
primulin. Citraconic anhydride also has the effect of reversing<br>
the charge on lysine residues and this may also play a role in<br>
releasing the primulin.<br>
Figures 8a and 8b illustrate exemplary tau-tau binding inhibitors,<br>
as disclosed in WO 96/30766.<br>
Figure 9 shows the fluorescence of primulin bound to PHFs in the<br>
presence of alcian blue. The figure demonstrates that, in the<br>
presence of alcian blue, a disrupter of PHF structure (Ref 33),<br>
there is no disturbance of the characteristic bound primulin<br>
fluorescence peak at 460nm. .<br>
Figure 10 shows the effect of various compounds ("MR", molar ratio<br>
of compound:tau) on tau-tau binding using tau proteins prepared<br>
according the method provided in WO96/30766 and refered to herein<br>
as "Preparation 1".<br>
Figure lla show schematically the synthesis of [11C]-labelled<br>
methylene blue. The reaction proceeds via N-methylation of the<br>
amines with [11c]iodomethane. HPLC can be used to purify the<br>
desired product from any by-products. Figure lib shows a further<br>
synthesis based on thionin, NaH and CH3I.<br>
Figure 12 shows schematically the synthesis of [11C] -labelled Azure<br>
B. The reaction proceeds via N-methylation of the amines with<br>
["Cliodomethane. HPLC can be used to purify the desired' product<br>
from any by-products.<br>
Figure 13 shows schematically the synthesis of a [18F] -labelled<br>
derivative of compound 4a of Figure 4. The reaction proceeds via<br>
nucleophilic aromatic substitution whereby a nitro-group on a<br>
precursor compound is exchanged for a [MF] fluoro group. HPLC can<br>
be used to purify the desired product from any by-products.<br>
Figure 14 shows the structures Primulin, Benthothiazole Analogue<br>
and Thiazin Yellow. The sizes of these molecules have been<br>
determined on the basis of C-C distances known from chrystal<br>
structures, and designated A and B for each molecule. The C-C<br>
Figures 15 and 16 illustrate the crystal structure of the 'B' part<br>
of the primulin structure (Soon-Beng Teo et al., 1995, Acta<br>
Crystallogr., Sect. C, 591.<br>
Figures 17 and 18 illustrate the crystal structure of a compound<br>
denoted N2A (Gilardi, R.D., 1972, Acta Chrystallogr., Sect. B,<br>
107).<br>
Figures 19 and 20 show the crystal structure of a diazoaminobenzene<br>
(Gladkova &amp; Kondrashev, 1972, Kristallografiya (41) 17 33.<br>
Figures 21 and 22 illustrate how the molecule of Figures 15 and 16<br>
crystalises in space.<br>
Figure 23 shows a Comparison of the mean, maximum and minimum<br>
extents of molecules which are active ligands (primulin and<br>
"analog"), and thiazin yellow (which is inactive as a ligand) . The<br>
dimensions are given in angstrom units (A0).<br>
Figure 24 shows a similar comparison for the basic benzothiazole<br>
nucleus (i.e. molecules lb and 2 of Figure 5) and the<br>
diaminophenothiazines. These distances are carbon-to-carbon<br>
distances.<br>
Figure 25 shows probability of extracellular tangles as a function<br>
of Braak staging. Stages 2-4 can be clearly distinguished from<br>
stage 1 on the basis of probability of extracellular tangles in<br>
B2/Trans and B4/HC.<br>
Figure 26 shows probability of intracellular tangles as a function<br>
of Braak staging. Intracellular tangles provide a poor basis for<br>
discrimination of early stages in these regions, but a good basis<br>
for discriminating stages 4 and 5 using neocortical regions.<br>
Figure 27 corresponds to Figure 25, but wherein cases with MMSE<br>
scores greater than 21 in the 12 months prior to death were<br>
selected. Similar results are obtained.<br>
Figure 28 corresponds to Figure 26, but using cases with MMSE<br>
scores greater than 21 in the 12 months prior to death were<br>
selected. Similar results are obtained.<br>
Figure 29 shows extracellular tangle densities (counts per mm2)<br>
as a function of Braak staging. Similar results are obtained to<br>
those shown in Figure 25.<br>
Figure 30 shows intracellular tangle densities (counts per nun2)<br>
as a function of Braak staging.<br>
Figure 31a shows a barely visible tangle visualised with<br>
thioflavin-T at 0.001% (arrowhead). In ifI suspensions such as<br>
this, tangles can be seen by blue fluorescence which is not<br>
distinct from that associated with binding of contaminants in the<br>
preparation. The bottom panel shows that blue tangle fluorescence<br>
produced by thioflavin-T at 0.001% is displaced by yellow tangle<br>
fluorescence produced by primulin at 0.001%. Figure 31b shows<br>
Electron-microscopy of PHFs labelled after Prohase digestion, (a)<br>
Chemical labelling with the biotinylated benzothiazole analogue<br>
shown as 4b in Figure 4. PHFs were deposited on a carbon-coated<br>
grid after Pronase digestion, and incubated briefly with compound<br>
4b, and then incubated with an anti-biotin antibody preparation<br>
that had been conjugated with colloidal gold. Decoration of<br>
isolated PHFs establishes that the compound 4b binds to the<br>
proteolytically stable PHF structure, (b) mAb 423 immunolabelling<br>
of isolated PHFs after Pronase digestion., followed by incubation<br>
with a gold-conjugated goat anti-mouse second antibody as described<br>
in Novak et al. 1993 (Novak M, Rabat J, Wischik CM (1993)<br>
"Molecular characterisation of the minimal protease-resistant tau<br>
unit of the Alzheimers' disease paired helical filament", KMBO J<br>
12: 365-370). As shown in this paper, mAb 423 lables PHFs derived<br>
from intracellular tangles (which preserve N-terminal tau<br>
immunoreactivity in the fuzzy outer coat) poorly, but Pronase<br>
digested PHFs strongly. Likewise Mena et al. (1996) (Mena R,<br>
Edwards PC, Harrington CR, Hukaetova-Ladinska EB, Wischik CM,<br>
"Staging the pathological assembly of truncated tau protein into<br>
paired helical filaments in Alzheimer's disease", Acta Neuropathol<br>
91: 633-641) shows that in intracellular tangles mAb 423<br>
immunoreactivity is largely occluded, but can be exposed by formic<br>
acid pretreatment of sections.<br>

tau binding activity when used in the aqueous-phase with dGA in the<br>

Compounds used herein were supplied by ICI Pharmaceuticals unless<br>
stated otherwise. Thioflavin-T and thiazine yellow were purchased<br>
from Fluka AG.<br>
Quantitation of Fluorescence<br>
Serial 16 urn sections are cut from the hippocampus of a case dying<br>
with clinically and neuropathologically confirmed AD. These<br>
sections were stained with thioflavin-S at concentrations 0.01%,<br>
0.001% or 0.0001% in water for 5-10 min, then washed in water, and<br>
mounted in Apathe's aqueous medium. In a second series of<br>
experiments, sections were cut from the hippocampus and nucleus<br>
basalis of Meynert. These sections were stained with primulin at<br>
concentrations 0.1%, 0.01%, 0.001% and 0.00001% in water for 5-10<br>
min, then washed in water, and mounted in Apathe's aqueous medium.<br>
A Leitz fluorescence microscope fitted with a photo-multiplyer tube<br>
(Model MPV-2) was used to quantitate fluorescence emission. Three<br>
Leitz filter blocks were used as follows:<br>
1. Filter block H2, code 513 417<br>
Excitation range Band pass 390-490nm<br>
Mirror RKP 510 (i.e. transmit below 510 nm)<br>
Suppression filter LP 515 (i.e. reflect above 515 nm)<br>
3. Filter block G, code 513 416<br>
Excitation range Band pass 350-460 nm<br>
Mirror RKP 510 (i.e. transmit below 510 nm)<br>
Suppression filter LP 515 (i.e. reflect above 515 nm)<br>
4. Filter block A, code 513 410<br>
Excitation range UV band pass 340-380 nm<br>
Mirror RKP 400 (i.e. transmit below 400 nm)<br>
Suppression filter LP 430 (i.e. reflect above 430 nm)<br>
Preparation of if I and II<br>
Ifl material was prepared as described by Wischik et al (1985) J<br>
Cell Biol 100: 1905-1912.<br>
IfZI material was prepared as described by Wischik et al (1995)<br>
Neurobiol Aging 16: 409-431. For experiments involving non-pronase<br>
digested ifll an identical protocol was followed, omitting the<br>
pronase digestion step.<br>
Spectrofluorimetry of if 11<br>
These measurements were carried out in a Perkin-Elmer<br>
spectrofluorimeter (model MPF-3). A concentration of ligand of<br>
0.00001% was routinely used for all measurements. Primulin was<br>
found to have an excitation peak at 370 nm and an emission peak at<br>
515 nm. All measurements were therefore carried out at a standard<br>
excitation wavelength of 370 nm, and a constant slit width of 3 mm.<br>
Coagoetltlve Binding Assay<br>
If I material was homogenised in a 0.2 ml glass homogeniser in PBS.<br>
To the suspension, test compounds were added to final<br>
concentrations ranging from 0.1% to 0.00001%. These were allowed<br>
to incubate for 5 min and primulin was added at equivalent or lower<br>
concentration. The suspensions were transferred to a glass slide,<br>
and examined by fluorescence microscopy across a range of<br>
fluorescence filter blocks, covering excitation and emission<br>
wavelengths between 380 nm and 570 nm. The end point sought in<br>
these observations was displacement of typical primulin<br>
fluorescence from tangle fragments.<br>
Ligand Electronmlcroscopy<br>
PHFs derived from an ifl fraction were deposited on a carbon coated<br>
grid after pronase digestion, and incubated briefly with a<br>
 preparation of biotinylated Primulin, and then incubated with an<br>
anti-biotin antibody that has been conjugated with colloidal gold<br>
by the method of Slot and Gueze (1981).<br>
Succinylatlon and Chromatography of IfII<br>
Washed ifII fractions were taken up in 8 M urea/50 mM borate (1 ml,<br>
pH 9) and sonicated, 1 ml succinic anhydride in acetone was added<br>
to a final concentration of 250 mM succinate in 4 ml, and the pH<br>
was maintained at 8.5 with sodium hydroxide. The solution was<br>
clarified by centrifugation and applied to a Sephacryl S200 column<br>
equilibrated bicarbonate. The column eluate was monitored at<br>
either 230 or 280 nm.<br>
Because succinylated fractions could not be visualised by Coomassie<br>
staining or silver staining of gels, bands were detected by<br>
autoradiography after specific chemical labelling of ifll fractions<br>
with Bolton-Hunter reagent (Amersham) .<br>
For photoaffinity labelling of PHF derived peptides, ifl or ifll<br>
fractions were pre-incubated with an Im-labelled photolabile<br>
derivative.<br>
The photolabelled fraction running at a Kav of 0.21 was<br>
concentrated by ultrafiltration through an Ami con YM2 membrane<br>
(10ml), digested with chymotrypsin (0.01 mg/ml) in 50 mM ammonium<br>
bicarbonate. Chymotryptic fragments for sequence analysis were<br>
isolated by Dr H.C. Thogersen by reverse phase HPLC using a C18<br>
column/ with a 0-100% acetyl nitrile gradient, with 0.1%<br>
trifluoroacetic acid. Chymotryptic peptides were sequenced.<br>
Morphological Studies of PHFs in the presence of phenothiazines<br>
For these experiments, ifll fractions were prepared as described<br>
above for electron microscopy. This material was either incubated<br>
directly with preparations of phenothiazines at final<br>
concentrations ranging between 0.1% and 0.0001% and then applied to<br>
carbon coated grids, and examined directly after LiPTA staining<br>
(1%) . Alternatively, ifll suspensions were deposited on carbon<br>
coated grids, partially dried, and washed with solutions of<br>
phenothiazine. Such preparations were either stained directly with<br>
LiPTA or were processed further for immunoelectron microscopy using<br>
6.423 as the primary antibody. Electron micrographs were recorded<br>
at nominal magnifications between 25,000 and 45,000.<br>
Calculation of aggregated tau protein in the extracellular space<br>
expressed in mg/g of brain tissue as a function of Braak staging<br>
Previously reported PHF-tau levels in pmol/g (P) and tangle counts<br>
per mm2 (T) in a clinically and neuropathologically staged cohort<br>
(R.Y.K. Lai, et al., Neuroblol Aging 16, 433 (1995)) were used to<br>
derive an estimate of PHF-tau level per affected pyramidal cell<br>
(PC) in pg/cell using the same ELISA in human brain. The tangle<br>
count per mm2 provides an estimate of the number of affected<br>
pyramidal cells within a volume lmmxlmmxO.lram (0.0001 cm3),<br>
allowing that any tangle profile counted in a nominal 7 pm section<br>
could extend ~ 45 urn orthogonal to the section in either direction<br>
(S.M. Blinkov, I.I. Glezer, The human brain in figures and tables,<br>
a quantitative handbook; Plenum Press, NY, 1968, Table 204). The<br>
core PHF-tau level in pg/cm3 is 10 x P since the PHF-core tau<br>
fragment is 10 kD (CM. Wischik, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Scl. USA<br>
85, 4506 (1988)). From this, PC - (P x 10) / (T / 0.0001). At<br>
Braak stages 4-6 (H. Braak, E. Braak, Acta Neuropathol. 82, 239<br>
(1991)), regional values for PC in grey matter were: frontal<br>
cortex, 0.13 ± 0.05 pg/cell; hippocampus, 0.60 ± 0.39 pg/cell;<br>
temporal cortex, 1.074 ± 0.44; entorhinal cortex 1.56 ± 0.63<br>
pg/cell. These differences reflect anatomical differences,<br>
different regional rates of disease progression (C. Bancher, H.<br>
Braak, P. Fischer, K. Jellinger, Meurosci. iett. 162, 179 (1993),<br>
also Gertz et al., Acta Neuropathol. 95, 154 (1988)), and the<br>
degree to which tangle counts underestimate PHFs accumulating in<br>
dystrophic neuritis at more advanced stages of pathology (Lai et<br>
al, 1995, loc cit). The overall means provide an approximation for<br>
the PHF-levels per cell which would be relevant to AD. These are<br>
0.37 ± 0.08 pg/cell for cases at Braak stages 1-3, and 1.08 ± 0.28<br>
pg/cell for cases at Braak stages 4-6.<br>
For the purpose of estimating extracellular aggregated PHF tau,<br>
shown below in the Table, and in Figure 26, 27, 29 and 31, tangles<br>
were counted as extracellular if mAb 423 immunoreactivity could be<br>
demonstrated after treatment of glass-mounted sections with 98%<br>
formic acid for 5 minutes prior to incubation with mAb 423 for 1<br>
hr- For the avoidance of doubt, this methodology differs from that<br>
reported in Mena et al. (1996) where free-floating vibrotome<br>
sections were incubated briefly with formic acid, and then<br>
overnight with mAb 423. As shown in that report, this latter<br>
overnight free-floating section protocol achieved maximal mAb 423<br>
immunoreactivity in intracellular tangles, and showed that all<br>
intracellular tangles contain mAb 423 immunoreactivity, albeit in a<br>
state substantially occluded by the fuzzy outer coat of the PHF<br>
(see Figure 3). The purpose of the present protocol was to ensure<br>
maximum labelling of the Stage 3 and Stage 2 tangles illustrated in<br>
Figure 3. Some minor degree of labelling of intracellular tangles<br>
could not be entirely excluded, and counting attempts have also<br>
been made where a subjective discrimination has been attempted.<br>
However, the latter estimates do not agree with density or<br>
probability of labelling of tangles by mAb AT8 (Figures 28, 30,<br>
32), which is solely intracellular, and shows completely different<br>
profiles with respect neuropathological stage from those revealed<br>
using mAb 423. For-the purposes of the present calculations,<br>
therefore, counts of mAb 423-immunoreactive tangles were taken as<br>
substantially or entirely representative of extracellular tangle<br>
pathology at Stages 2 and 3 as shown in Figure 3, but substantially<br>
not Stage 1 of Figure 3. For the avoidance of doubt, the Stages<br>
referred to in Figure 3 are not Braak stages, but stages of<br>
degeneration of a single neurone containing a tangle.<br>
wherein:<br>
BST is Braak Stage<br>
ME1T4 is the extracellular tangle count<br>
PC is an estimate of the PHF-tau concentration per cell (calculated<br>
as above)<br>
PT4 is the PBF content ascribed to extracellular tangles (PC x<br>
HEIT4)<br>
RE63B is the grouping of brain regions into 3 groups as per Figs 26<br>
and 27 of the SK1T4 is the standard error of the extracellular<br>
tangle count<br>
Example 1 - aggregated tau in Braak staging<br>
Based on immunochemical properties (Refs 26, 27, 30), it is<br>
possible to distinguish intracellular tangles from extracellular<br>
tangles. Both frequency of cases with tangles in these categories<br>
(ie probability) and their quantity (ie counts per mm2) were<br>
determined in a prospective case series and grouped into the<br>
regions known to represent stages in the progression of pathology<br>
according to the system of Braak and Braak<br>
As shown in Figure 25, stages 2-4 can be clearly distinguished<br>
from stage 1 on the basis of probability of extracellular tangles<br>
in E2/Trans<br>
and E4/HC. Also shown are the figures for F/T/P regions<br>
(neooortical regions - frontal/ temporal/ parietal) . <br>
Conversely/ intracellular tangles provide a poor basis for<br>
discrimination of early stages in these regions, but a good basis<br>
for discriminating stages 4 and 5 using neocortical regions.<br>
Similarly, when cases with MMSE scores greater than 21 in the 12<br>
months prior to death were selected, similar results were obtained.<br>
Again, similar results were obtained when tangle densities were<br>
determined.<br>
These results can be converted into approximations for the quantity<br>
of aggregated tau protein in the extracellular space expressed in<br>
ug/g of brain tissue as described in Materials and Methods above.<br>
The results are shown in Table 1. These are underestimates, as the<br>
tangle counts underestimate the quantity of aggregated tau protein.<br>
Table 1 shows quantity of aggregated tau protein in the<br>
extracellular space expressed in pg/g of brain tissue as a function<br>
of Braak staging. The data was calculated as described in the<br>
materials and methods.<br>
In summary, these results demonstrate that extracellular deposits<br>
of PHF-tau in medial temporal lobe structures provide a basis for<br>
empirical staging of the neurofibrillary degeneration of AD. Such<br>
staging could only be accomplished by radio-imaging methods<br>
provided suitable ligands could be created.<br>
Example 2 - assessment of compounds binding within the aggregated<br>
repeat domain of PHF-core tau protein<br>
A prototype compound was obtained as one component of the crude,<br>
commercially-available preparation of thioflavin-S was separated<br>
into ~20 distinct constituents by analytical thin-layer<br>
 chromatography, and preparative chromatography. Tests showed that<br>
not all of the constituents were able to act as effective tangle<br>
ligands. Specifically, pure primulin (Figure 5, compound la) was<br>
found to label tangles, but the benzothiazole thioflavin-T (Figure<br>
5, compound lb) was much less effective, although it labelled<br>
amyloid preferentially.<br>
Furthermore, compound la was found to displace compound lb at<br>
tangles when the latter was introduced at 10-fold excess into crude<br>
tangle extracts.<br>
A possible difference was postulated to be the sulphonate group at<br>
position 1 (Figure 5, compound 2 [2 - (4 - amino phenyl) - 6 -<br>
methyl - 1 - sulphonate benzothiazole]). However, primulin<br>
(compound la) was found to displace this from tangles (though not<br>
amyloid) . Therefore, tangle labelling is not due solely to the<br>
sulphonated benzothiazole structure, indicating that a longer<br>
aromatic structure is required.<br>
Purified thiazin red (Figure 5, compound 3a) was found to compete<br>
with primulin at equivalent concentrations, whereas the compound 3b<br>
(thiazin yellow, Figure 5) did not. Therefore, an extended aromatic<br>
benzothiazole structure does not, per ae, determine high binding<br>
affinity within tangles.<br>
In order to define a minimum critical requirement for competitive<br>
binding, the sulphonated benzothiazole was extended by addition of<br>
a single phenyl group across a diamino-linkage. This compound<br>
(Figure 4, compound 4a), although not fluorescent, was found to<br>
compete out thiazin red and primulin fluorescence at equivalent<br>
concentrations. Compound 4a therefore defines the minimum critical<br>
structure required for high affinity binding within the tangle.<br>
In order to prove that the binding site within the tangle was in<br>
fact the PHF itself, compound 4a was further extended with addition<br>
of a biotin group (Figure 4, compound 4b). Since this was still<br>
found to compete primulin and thiazin red, compound 4b preserved<br>
high affinity binding within the tangle. Furthermore, immunogold-<br>
conjugated anti-biotin antibody was found to label isolated PHFs<br>
pre-incubated with compound 4b, whereas no labelling was<br>
demonstrated without pre-incubation or pre-incubation with biotin<br>
alone (Fig 31b). Finally, when a photo-activated conjugate of the<br>
compound was prepared, it was possible to identify and sequence the<br>
labelled protein. This was found to be the same core tau fragment<br>
as that isolated from the core of the PHF, which comprises the<br>
repeat region of the tau protein.<br>
In summary, these results demonstrate unequivocally that the<br>
binding site for compounds 4a and 4b is within the aggregated<br>
repeat domain of the tau protein of the PHF-core. Furthermore,<br>
they demonstrate that compound 4a can be used as a chelate for<br>
addition of functional groups without disturbing ligand activity<br>
within the PHF core. Therefore, compound 4a could be used as<br>
chelate for addition of technetium or other imaging moiety to<br>
generate a ligand suitable for detecting e.g. extracellular tangles<br>
in AD.<br>
Example 3 - determination of optimum dimensions of ligand molecules<br>
Figure 14 shows three of the structures described above, along with<br>
their dimensions as indicated. For example, the Cll-Cl distance<br>
and C10-C1 distance are shown for primulin, a benzothiazole<br>
analogue (denoted 'analog'), and 'thiazin yellow*.<br>
Figure 15 and 16 illustrate the crystal structures of the 'B' part<br>
of the priuulin structure (Soon-Beng Teo et al., 1995, Acta<br>
Crystallogr., Sect. C, 591. As can be seen from Figure 16, which .<br>
is a 'side-on' view, the molecule is essentially flat, although it<br>
has a slight twist. The1 A' part of primulin can be computed from<br>
the same molecule. Frot this, one can derive measures of A+B, which<br>
provide an indication of the actual length of one of the active<br>
species of the present invention.<br>
To compute the size of the "analog" shown in Figure 14, measurement<br>
A was used from the data of Figure 15, and measurement B was<br>
determined from a molecule denoted N2A and shown in Figures 17 and<br>
18 (Gilardi, R.D., 1972, Acta Chrystallogr., Sect. B, 107). As can<br>
be seen from the side-on view in Figure 18, this part of the<br>
molecule is completely flat. The same measurements apply to<br>
thiazin red, which is identical in its dimensions to the "analog".<br>
The size of thiazin yellow (shown in Figure 14) was determined as<br>
follows. The 'A' part comes from the molecule of Figure 15 which<br>
was used for primulin, while the 'B' part comes from the molecule<br>
shown in Figures 19 and 20 (Gladkova et al., 1972, Kristallografiya<br>
41) . Again, part B of the molecule is completely flat, and the only<br>
difference with respect to the molecule shown in Figure 17 is the<br>
distance between the aromatic groups.<br>
Figures 21 and 22 illustrate how the molecule of Figure 15<br>
crystallises in space. As can be seen, the molecule forms an<br>
alternating 'herring-bone' pattern, and does not stack. In<br>
comparison, the crystal structure of methylene blue indicates that<br>
the molecules form stacks with alternating sheets of water<br>
molecules between the pi-bonded stacks.<br>
Table 2 tabulates the minimum, maximum and mean dimensions for<br>
primulin ("PRIM"), the analog ("ANAL"), thiazin yellow, and the<br>
benzothiazole unit alone (i.e. structures lb and 2 as shown in<br>
Figure 5). The corresponding methylene blue dimensions are given as<br>
•MBCC (carbon to carbon) and 'MBNN' (nitrogen to nitrogen):<br>
Figure 23 shows a comparison of the mean, maximum and minimum<br>
extents of molecules which are active ligands (primulin and<br>
"analog"), and thiazin yellow (which is inactive as a ligand). The<br>
dimensions are given in angstrom'units (AO) . In Figure 24, a<br>
similar comparison is made for the basic benzothiazole nucleus<br>
(i.e. molecules lb and 2 of Figure 5) and the<br>
diaminophenothiazines. These distances are carbon-to-carbcm<br>
distances.<br>
The above results illustrate that the molecules provided herein are<br>
substantially flat. There is, however, a fundamental difference in<br>
activity between ligands according to the present invention and<br>
other molecules discussed above. As is shown in the Figures,<br>
suitable ligands according to the invention comprise long, flat<br>
molecules with dimensions between 14.783 and 15.261 AU. On the<br>
other hand, a longer molecule, such as thiazin yellow, which<br>
exceeds these dimensions (mean 15.927 AU) does not serve as an<br>
effective ligand, even though it is flat. However, certain shorter,<br>
flat, molecules bind preferentially to amyloid.<br>
Example 4 - PET using ligand molecules and inhibitors<br>
Figures 11 to 13 indicate typical synthesis methods which could be<br>
used to convert either the dianinophenothiazines or the "analog"<br>
into positron emitting species.<br>
Figure lib in particular shows a method whereby thionin is treated<br>
with NaH followed by labelled methyl iodide to give methylene blue.<br>
A similar procedure can be adopted for the synthesis of methylene<br>
blue starting from Azure A and Azure B. Other strong bases may<br>
also be used.<br>
Other methods that may be used include HC1 and labelled MeOH;<br>
labelled trimethyl phosphoric acid; labelled dimethylsulphoxide and<br>
Labelled formaldehyde. The chemistry of the syntheses and general<br>
methodology are all familiar to persons skilled in the art. These<br>
examples are given without any implied restriction as to ultimate<br>
methodology.<br>
Example 5 - blocking Uganda<br>
Compounds such as thioflavin-T and -S strongly stain amyloid<br>
deposits. However Figure 31 demonstrates that such compounds can be<br>
displaced from tangles by primulin. Therefore these compounds may<br>
be used as blocking reagents to saturate binding - sites which are<br>
not of interest without inhibiting the binding of ligands to<br>
aggregated tau.<br>
Example 6 - comparison of ligand molecules and inhibitors<br>
There appears to be a fundamental difference in activity of the<br>
molecules which are effective ligands, compared with those which<br>
are effective inhibitors of tau-tau binding. The benzothiazole<br>
molecule does not disrupt PHFs, nor indeed do any of the ligands,<br>
whereas the diaminophenothiazine series constitute PHF-disrupters<br>
and tau aggregation inhibitors.<br>
Further investigations into the relationship between aggregation-<br>
dependent tau ligands and tau aggregation inhibitors were carried<br>
out using primulin. Pximilin in solution has a fluorescence peak at<br>
520 nm. This shifts to 470 nm when primulin is bound within a pure<br>
preparation of PHFs (Figure 6). Treatment of PHFs with citraconic<br>
anhydride, which has been shown to disrupt the structure of the PHF<br>
and liberate free tau (as well as reversing the charge on lysines),<br>
was found abolish the 470 nm fluorescence peak (Figure 7).<br>
Therefore, binding by such compounds is dependent on the<br>
polymerised state of tau found in the PHF, but is not present in<br>
free tau.<br>
Compounds have been identified which disrupt the structure of the<br>
PHF and reverse the proteolytic stability of the PHF core (see WO<br>
96/30766). Examples of such compounds are shown in accompanying<br>
Figure 8. The present inventors have now identified that these<br>
compounds bind to tau at a specific binding site within the high<br>
affinity tau-tau binding domain. However, it is found that such<br>
compounds may not disrupt the binding of primulin to tau in<br>
aggregated tau molecules, as shown by the retention of the<br>
fluorescence peak of primulin at 470 nm in the presence of alcian<br>
blue (Figure 9).<br>
Thus it appears that although alcian blue can inhibit tau-tau<br>
interactions/ either the site of the inhibition, or perhaps the<br>
order of binding interaction at which it acts, are such as to leave<br>
binding site for SB-ligands extant. Thus compounds which act as<br>
ligands of aggregated tau do not appear to bind at the same site(s)<br>
as compounds which are tau-aggregation inhibitors, although they<br>
may still affect the inhibitory properties of those inhibitors (see<br>
Example 7 below).<br>
This point was further examined by studying the potency of typical<br>
aggregated tau ligands as tau-aggregation inhibitors. It has been<br>
shown previously that tau aggregation inhibitors (e.g.<br>
diaminophenothiazines) can be identified on the basis of inhibition<br>
of tau-tau binding in a solid-phase assay (WO 96/30766). when<br>
tested in the same assay, primulin and thiazin red were found to be<br>
weak inhibitors of tau-tau binding (Figure 10) . Thus, although<br>
these compounds are potent ligands for tau within the PHF-core,<br>
they are at most weak inhibitors at the site required for<br>
inhibition of tau-tau binding.<br>
Demonstration that compounds of the diaminophenothiazine-like class<br>
bind tau in the aggregated state is provided by the direct<br>
demonstration of disruption of PHF structure in the presence of<br>
sufficiently high concentrations, particularly of compounds such as<br>
methylene blue. Thus, compounds of the diaminophenothiazine-like<br>
class which are inhibitors of tau-tau binding can serve as<br>
aggregated-tau ligands at lower concentrations.<br>
In summary, the inventors have found that it is possible to define<br>
two classes of binding site within the core-PHF tau aggregate.<br>
Both are potentially useful for the development of radiological<br>
imaging ligands:<br>
(i) Sulphonated benzothiazole-like sites: compounds of this type,<br>
associated with suitable chelates such as technetium, may serve as<br>
ligands for extracellular tangles, due to their size and charge.<br>
(ii) Diaminophenothiazine-like .sites: such compounds, when suitably<br>
labelled with a positron-emitting functional group, would serve as<br>
ligands for all tau aggregates, and would be capable of crossing<br>
the blood-brain-barrier (Ref 36) and entering cells. Thus these<br>

(i) Preparation of Tau protein In which partial aggregation has<br>
occurred.<br>
The preparation ("Preparation 2") is shown schematically in Figure<br>
32, and differs from earlier described methods (e.g. in<br>
WO96/30766- "Preparation 1" - shown in (ii) below).<br>
The recombinant cDNA plasmids are those described in WO96/30766 the<br>
disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference.<br>
Briefly, tau cDNA was generated using standard protocols (Sambrook,<br>
Fritsch &amp; Maniatis "Molecular cloning. A Laboratory Manual" (1989)<br>
Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, M.Y.) from mRNA isolated from brain<br>
tissue of an Alzheimer patient whose tissue was obtained 3 h after<br>
death. The cDNA library was screened with synthetic 17-mer<br>
oligonucleotide probes derived from the sequence from part of a PHF<br>
core protein (Goedert et al. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 85,<br>
4051-4055). Full length cDNA clones were subcloned into the EcoRI<br>
site of M13mpl9 and site-directed mutagenesis used to introduce a<br>
Ndel site in the context of the initiator codon. Following<br>
cleavage with Ndel and EcoRI, the resulting cDNA fragments were<br>
subcloned downstream of the T7 RNA polymerase promotor into<br>
Ndel/EcoRI -cut expression plasmid pRK172 (McLeod et al. (1987)<br>
EMBO J., 6, 729-736) . PRK172 is a derivative of pBR322 that is<br>
propagated at very high copy number in E. coli due to removal of<br>
the pBR322 copy number control region. The plasmid carries an<br>
ampicillin resistance gene for selection of recombinant clones.<br>
cDNA constructs coding for truncated forms of tau were prepared<br>
from mRNA as described in Novak et al. (1993) EMBO J., 12, 365-370.<br>
The mRNA was used as a template for polymerase chain reaction (PCR)<br>
using specific oligonucleotide primers. The sense primer contained<br>
an Ndel site and the anti-sense, an EcoRI site. PCR fragments were<br>
subcloned into pRK172 as described above. The primers used for<br>
construction of dGAE are given in Figure 22. The authenticity of<br>
all DNA fragments used for expression was confirmed by full length<br>
sequencing of both strands.<br>
Details for the construction of htau40 ("T40") cDNA are described<br>
in (Goedert et al. (1989), Neuron 3: 519-526). This sequence is<br>
the largest form of tau found in the CNS and encodes tau protein<br>
that contains both the 2 N-termlnal inserts of 29 amino acids each<br>
and an extra 31 amino acid repeat in the tubulin-binding domain.<br>
The DNA sequence and its predicted amino acid sequence are shown in<br>
Figure 21 (SEQ ID NO: 4).<br>
Recambinant plasmids were used to transform E. coli BL21 (DE3) a<br>
strain used for prokaryotic expression which carries a chromosomal<br>
copy of the bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase gene under control of<br>
the lac DV5 promotor (Studier and Noffat (1986), J. Mol. Biol. 189,<br>
113-130). Exponentially growing cultures were induced with IPTG<br>
* (iso-propyl thiogalactodise) for 3h.<br>
Large-scale purification (1 litre bacterial culture) of tau<br>
fragments was carried out as described by Goedert and Jakes (1990,<br>
EMBO J., 9_, 4225-4230), with minor modifications. Cells were<br>
disrupted by rapid freezing of the cell pellet in liquid nitrogen.<br>
The pellets were then suspended in buffer containing 50 mM PIPES, 1<br>
mM dithiothreitol (DTT) (pH 6.8). The thermostable proteins in the<br>
supernatant were dialysed against PIPES/DTT, then applied to a<br>
column containing phosphocellulose equilibrated in the same buffer.<br>
Tau protein was eluted with a gradient of NaCl (0-0.5M) in the<br>
above buffer. Fractions were analysed by SDS-PAGE and both<br>
Coomassie staining and immunoblotting. Those fractions containing<br>
tau were pooled, dialysed against 25mM MES, 1 mM DTT (pH 6.25) and<br>
stored at -20°C at approximately 5 mg/ml. Protein concentrations<br>
were measured by the Lowry method (Harrington CR(1990), "Lowry<br>
protein assay containing sodium dodecyl sulphate in microtitre<br>
plates for protein determinations on fractions from brain tissue",<br>
Analytical Biochemistry 186: 285-287).<br>
Preparation 2 differs from Preparation 1 above in the following<br>
respects: (1) The concentration of cells at the sonication stage is<br>
increased by 5-fold. (2) A batchwise adsorption of non-tau<br>
proteins to DE52 is included. (3) The proteins are not subjected<br>
to heat treatment. (4) The final step involves concentration using<br>
polyethylene glycol.<br>
• Escherichia coli is grown in 2xTY medium (Oxoid) supplemented with<br>
ampicillin (50 micrograms per ml) to late-logarithmic phase. Cells<br>
from 5 litres of culture are harvested by centrifugatlon and the<br>
cell pellets frozen rapidly over liquid nitrogen. The pellets are<br>
taken up with 50 mM PIPES (pH 6.8) containing lmM EDTA, lmH<br>
dithiothreitol and lnM phenylmethylsulphonylfluoride (PMSF) and<br>
bacteria lysed by sonication (2x3 min) at 4C. The mixture is<br>
centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 20 min. The supernatant is rotated<br>
with 1 gram of Whatman DE52 for 3 hr at 4C. The mixture is<br>
separated on a column and the flow-through material that fails to<br>
bind to OE52 is incubated for 3 hr at 4C, with rotation, with 0.4 g<br>
of Whatman Pll (freshly regenerated according to manufacturer's<br>
recommendations). The column is washed with column buffer (50 mM<br>
PIPES, pH 6.8 containing lmM BGTA, 5mM EDTA, 0.2mM MgCl2, 5aM 0~<br>
mercAptoethanol and lmM PMSF). Tau protein is eluted stepwise with<br>
a 0.1 to 1 M gradient of KC1 in column buffer. Fractions<br>
containing tau (determined by imnunoassay) are pooled and dialysed<br>
against 80mM PIPES (pH6.8) containing lmM EGTA, lmM MgCl2 and 5mM<br>
p-mercatoethanol, using dialysis tubing with a molecular weight<br>
cut-off of 1,000. The dialysate is concentrated by applying<br>
polyethylene glycol 8000 to the outside of the sac for 2-3 hr. The<br>
final concentration of tau ranged from 3 to 10 mg per ml.<br>
In a typical large scale preparative run, the specific<br>
immunoreactivity of tau is purified approximately 30- to 40-fold<br>
front the material that fails to bind to DE52. Approximately 60% of<br>
the tau is recovered in the final product with 10% failing to bind<br>
to Pll and the remainder in fractions ignored from the column.<br>
Table 3 shows the details of a preparative run for dGA.<br>
"Purification-fold" is expressed as the ratio of specific<br>
immunoreactivity for each fraction (ie immunoreactivity / protein<br>
concentration) to specific immunoreactivity in the DE flow-through.<br>
Proteins were separated by running down a 50 x lcm sepharose CL-6B<br>
gel filtration column equilibrated with PBS buffer and run at room<br>
temperature. A molecular weight standard curve was prepared for the<br>
column by running molecular weight markers over the range 12,400 to<br>
200,000 down the column. A standard curve was prepared by plotting<br>
the logio of the Mr in Kd against Ve/Vo for each protein standard,<br>
where Ve is the elution volume for the standard and Vo is the void<br>
volume for the column determined with blue dextran.<br>
T40 or dGAE were loaded in 0.5ml buffer containing 5% glycerol and<br>
collected in lml fractions. Presence of protein in the fractions<br>
was determined spectrophotometrically by the absorbance at 280nm.<br>
Presence of dGAE or T40 was detected by BLISA with monoclonal<br>
antibody 7/51 or 499 respectively. BLISA assay was carried out in<br>
96 well PVC plates as follows:<br>
50ml samples of each fraction incubate lhr at 37C, wash plate in<br>
0.05% tween-20 and then block binding sites with 200ul PBS + 2%<br>
non fat milk powder for lhr at 37C. Wash plate in 0.05% tween-20,<br>
incubate with 50ml priaary antibody diluted 1:10 in PBS + 2% non<br>
fat milk powder for lhr at 37c. Hash plate in 0.05% tween-20,<br>
incubate with 50ul secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse IgG:HRP<br>
conjugate) diluted in PBS + 2% non fat milk powder for lhr at 37C.<br>
Wash plate in 0.05% tween-20 then rinse in deionised water, add<br>
50ul freshly prepared substrate (TUB [tetramethylbenzidine] in<br>
sodium acetate buffer pH5.0 with H2O2, freshly prepared) and read<br>
rate of change in OD 650 over 2 minutes.<br>
The elution profile of purified dGAE and purified T40 is shown in<br>
Figures 34 {dGAB) and 35 (hT40). Although both these fragments<br>
typically run at about 12 kD and 55 kD respectively, about 64% of<br>
mAb 7.51 immunoreactivity (dGAB) elutes in fractions corresponding<br>
to species of size &gt; 15fcD and about 50% of mAb 499 immunoreactivity<br>
(hT40)eluted in fractions corresponding to species of size &gt; 60kD.<br>
Thus the tau proteins are present, at least in part, in pre-<br>
aggregated form.<br>
(ii) effect of tau aggregation Inhibitors measured using different<br>
preparations of Tau protein<br>
When the proteins dGA and dGAB were prepared as indicated above<br>
("Preparation 2"), the properties of the tau-tau binding assay were<br>
altered relative to the properties obtained using the preparative<br>
method described in W096/30766 ("Preparation 1").<br>
The assay is performed using 96 well PVC plates (Falcon Cat. No.<br>
353912 are used), and the following steps:<br>
1. 50 m1 dGA (~10 mg/ml) in carbonate buffer, incubate 1 h at 37°c.<br>
(Carbonate buffer: SO oM carbonate bicarbonate, pH 9.6 (Na2CO3 1.59<br>
g/1, NaHCO, 2.93 g/1))<br>
2. Wash plate in 0.05% Tween-20.<br>
3 200 ml PBS+2% Marvel, incubate 1 h at 37°C.<br>
4. Rinse plate 2X in deoinised water, then wash in 0.05% Tween-20.<br>
5 50 ul dGAE (-10 mg/ml) plus drug in PBS+1% fish skin<br>
gelatin+0.05% Tween-20, incubate 1 h at 37°C.<br>
6 Wash plate in 0.05% Tween-20.<br>
7 50 ul antibody 423 (1:10 dilution in PBS+2% Marvel), incubate 1<br>
h at 37°C.<br>
8 Rinse plate 2X in deionised water, then wash in 0.05% Tween-20.<br>
9 50 ul HRP-anti-mouse (1:1000 dilution in PBS+0.05% Tween-20),<br>
incubate 1 h at 37'C.<br>
10 Wash plate in 0.05% Tween-20, then rinse IX with deionised<br>
water.<br>
11 50 pi substrate solution, read immediately initial rate over 2<br>
min in plate reader at OD650.<br>
(Substrate solution: 50 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.0 + TMB (1 ml/100<br>
ml of a 10 mg/ml solution in DMSO) + H2O2 (10 ml/100 ml)) .<br>
The compounds thionine and tolonium chloride were found to require<br>
higher concentrations to exert inhibitory effects in Preparation 2<br>
than in Preparation 1. This is shown in Figures 36 and 37.<br>
Furthermore, the compound dimethyl methylene blue (DMMB) was found<br>
to have a higher inhibitory potency in Preparation 2 than in<br>
Preparation 1. This is shown in Figure 38.<br>
As similar differences could be seen in Tau protein prepared by the<br>
Preparation 1 method, but which had been allowed to aggregate in<br>
vitro over time, the interpretation of this effect is as follows.<br>
Higher concentrations of compounds such as thionine and tolonium<br>
chloride are required since two effects have to be achieved in<br>
order to achieve maximal inhibition of tau-tau binding:<br>
1. disruption of pre-existing aggregates in the aqueous-phase;<br>
2. inhibition of binding of aqueous-phase species to the solid<br>
phase.<br>
The greater potency of DUMB in the Preparation 2 assay can be<br>
explained by greater binding affinity at the site of action<br>
required for both inhibitory effects.<br>
Full-length tau protein (hT40) prepared according to the<br>
Preparation 2 protocol demonstrated minimal tau-tau binding<br>
activity when used in the aqueous-phase with dGA in the solid-<br>
phase. However, when hT40 was used in the solid-phase, binding of<br>
dGAB was similar to that obtained for binding of dGAE to dGA in the<br>
solid-phase (see Figure 39a-c). The interpretation is that in hT40<br>
aggregates formed in the aqueous-phase tau-tau.binding has already<br>
occurred in or through domains required for the binding interaction<br>
with dGA in the solid-phase. When hT40 is first plated in the<br>
solid-phase, the binding to PVC unfolds the protein/aggregates in<br>
such as manner as to make the critical tau-tau binding sites<br>
available.<br>
(Ill) effect of tau aggregation Inhibitors measured using different<br>
preparations of Tau protein<br>
In the Preparation 2 assay format, potent ligands of the kind<br>
typified by Primulin and Thiazin Red have no inhibitory activity on<br>
tau-tau binding. This is shown in Figure 40 (cf. Figure 10). Indeed<br>
in this assay, these compounds enhance tau-tau binding at<br>
concentrations greater than 100 uH (i.e. 100-fold molar ratio with<br>
respect to tau protein).<br>
DUMB typically reduces tau-tau binding (with tau present typically<br>
at 1 mN) to 23% at DUMB 5 mM and 17% at OMMB 15 mM relative to that<br>
seen in the absence of DUMB.<br>
Unexpectedly, this inhibitory effect can be completely reversed by<br>
co-incubation in the presence of increasing concentrations of high<br>
affinity Uganda typified by Priaulin and Thiazin Red. This is<br>
shown in Figure 41.<br>
Therefore, aggregated-tau liganda nay be characterised functionally<br>
as compounds which do not themselves inhibit tau-tau binding, but<br>
block the inhibitory effects of potent inhibitors of tau-tau<br>
binding.<br>
As can be seen in Figure 42, inhibition of Tau-Tau binding produced<br>
by DMMB is progressively attenuated and reversed in the presence of<br>
increasing molar excess of Primulin. A similar effect can be shown<br>
for Thiazin Red. This indicates that the maximum inhibitory effect<br>
of DMMB is reduced by these compounds, and hence that they are<br>
acting as non-competitive inhibitors of DMMB. One possible<br>
explanation might be that the ligands stabilise the tau aggregates<br>
used in the assay, for example in regions outside the critical<br>
binding domain required for DNMB activity, and hence prevent the<br>
inhibitory effect of ONNB on Tau-Tau binding.<br>
Figures 43 - 45 show that for any given concentration of DMMB,<br>
there is quantitative enhancement of Tau-Tau binding in the<br>
presence of Primulin (43, 44) or Thiazin Red (45) which can be<br>
modelled by a standard Michaella-Menten equation. This implies that<br>
the Tau-aggregation enhancement effect of these ligands is<br>
proportional to the fraction of ligand-binding sites occupied,<br>
presumably within the Tau aggregates inroduced into the aqueous-<br>
phase of the assay. The mean Bmax for both ligands is ~ 1.6. That<br>
is, the maximum ligand effect is to produce 1.6-fold the Tau-Tau<br>
binding signal seen in the absence of any drug. The mean Kd for<br>
this effect is - 15x. That is, for any given concentration of DMMB<br>
&gt; 4 mM, 50% of maximal enhancement of Tau-Tau binding can be aeen<br>
whan the ligand molar excess is 15-fold relative to the<br>
concentration of DMMB.<br>
Example 8 - example assays for identifying further diagnostic<br>
ligands based on liqands provided herein<br>
Having defined two classes of ligands as described above suitable<br>
for labelling PHFs in AD, further ligands can be developed using<br>
the compounds/derivatives in screening assays. Furthermore,<br>
modelling methods can be based on the ligands already presented.<br>
(1), Identification of aovel ligands at the sulphonated-<br>
benxothlazole site.<br>
Using a suitably labelled preparation of a known sulphonated<br>
benzothiazole, incubated with a preparation of aggregated tau<br>
molecules (e.g. preaggregated tau in solution, or bound to a solid<br>
phase, or highly enriched PHFs isolated from AO brain - see<br>
WO96/30766) compounds suspected of being suitable ligands can be<br>
introduced, and their capacity to compete with the known ligand in<br>
such a way as to prevent binding within the PHF can be tested.<br>
(11) Identification of novel Uganda at the phenothiazine site.<br>
The tau-tau binding assay described in HO 96/30766 can be used as a<br>
preliminary screen to identify potential inhibitors at the tau-tau<br>
binding site. Likewise, a suitably-labelled preparation of known<br>
diaminophenothiazines, incubated with a aggregated tau as described<br>
above, could be used to screen for other compounds which are<br>
suspected of being competitors at this PHF-binding site and thus<br>
potentially suitable PHF ligands.<br>
The physical implementation of competitive assays is well known in<br>
the art. It may include measurement of fluorescence, radioactivity<br>
or any other suitable reporting system which derives from<br>
sulphonated benzothiasole-like compounds or diaminophenothiazine-<br>
like compounds not bound to PHFs, i.e. those which remain in<br>
solution.<br>
