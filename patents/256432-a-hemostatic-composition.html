				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a hemostatic composition.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is generally directed to hemostatic compositions, and more particularly to a magnetic hemostatic composition for controlling external or internal bleeding.<br>
Magnetic fluids are magnetic field responsive fluids containing magnetizable particles dispersed in a liquid carrier. These fluids typically have been used in devices, such as dampers, shock absorbers, seals, valves and the like to provide varying stress levels controlled by an external magnetic field. The variable stress is created by magnetic coupling of the particles in the form of chains or bent wall-like structures upon interaction with an external magnetic field. As to the composition, these fluids are typically made of micron-sized particles dispersed in an engineering medium, such as hydraulic oil, mineral oil, or water, or the like.<br>
	More recently, the use of magnetic particles has been<br>
extended to both in vitro and in vivo applications, including drug targeting, bimolecular separation and detection, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The compositions of such particles are, however, limited only to certain types of iron oxides, for example, magnetite, due to its biodegradibility and biocompatibility. However, many properties of such particles, for example, toxicity and immunological response, are still unknown.<br>
	Various prior art methods and compositions disclose the<br>
use of hemostatic agents to attenuate bleeding. Examples include U.S. Patents 3,047,507; 3,937,839; 4,107,288; 4,268,413; 4,443,430; 4,501,726; 4,554,088; 4,637,394; 4,721,618; 4,992,190; 4,999,188; 5,180,583; 5,202,352; 5,207,675; 5,236,410; 5,354,488; 5,358,659; 5,374,246; 5,427,767; 5,507,744; 5,595,735; 5,624,685; 5,635,162; 5,635,215; 5,645,849; 5,670,078; 5,695,480; 5,702,630; 5,782,954; 5,800,372; 6,036,955; 6,051,607; 6,096,021; 6,189,538; 6,299,619; 6,315,709; 6,335,384 and 6,355,275.<br>
	There is a need in the industry, however, for a hemostatic<br>
composition or fluid which controls both external and internal hemorrhage.<br>
OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
 The principal object of the present invention is to provide a hemostatic composition and/or fluid, which is biologically non-toxic, biocompatible, easily disposable, noninteracting with other biological structures or biomolecules present in the bloodstream, and which can be effectively used to control both internal and external hemorrhage anywhere in the circulatory system of a subject.<br>
	An object of the present invention  is to provide a<br>
hemostatic composition and/or fluid, which is magnetically responsive and exhibits rheological changes upon interaction with an external magnetic field.<br>
 Another object of the present invention is to provide a hemostatic composition and/or fluid, which controls or stops bleeding in a very short time, for example, in less than about five minutes.<br>
	Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
hemostatic composition and/or fluid, which undergoes a reversible liquid-solid transition under the action of an external magnetic field that causes localized hemostasis at the site of an injury or lesion.<br>
	An additional object of the present invention is to provide<br>
a hemostatic composition and/or fluid, wherein the particle dispersed therein can be easily produced with tailored dimensions, such as size, shape and distribution,   to   optimize   magnetic   response,   to   make   the   particles<br>
biocompatible and non-toxic, and to easily dispose off the particles after treatment.<br>
	An additional object of the present invention is to provide<br>
a method of controlling or arresting hemorrhage or bleeding (external or internal) by the use of magnetic particles dispersed in various fluids.<br>
	In summary, the main object of the present invention is to<br>
provide magnetically responsive and biocompatible particles that, when dispersed in various fluids, exhibit rheological changes upon interaction with an external magnetic field. These fluids, when injected at the site of a lesion or injury, for example, a capillary hemorrhage, form a seal once a magnetic field is positioned adjacent the site of the injury or lesion. The seal formation is due to the formation of particle chains or clusters upon induction of a magnetic moment. The particles range in size from about 5 nm to 10 urn, with shapes, such as spherical, needle-like, oval, etc., and include compositions, such as iron, iron oxides, Ni, Co, etc. To achieve inertness, the particles are preferably coated with gold or silica, and/or polymers, such as poly (ethylene glycol), dextran, sorbitol,and other biocompatible polymers,such as Tween<br>
and the like. The use of polymer coating is considered preferable to disperse the particles in carrier liquids, such as saline, ringer's solution, water, blood plasma, and the like. The particle parameters, such as size, shape and magnetism, can be optimized so as to make the particles non-toxic, biocompatible,   chemically   inert,   easily   disposable,   substantially   non-<br><br>
immunogenic, substantially insoluble in blood, and non-interacting with other biological structures or biomolecules present in the blood stream. The application of the present invention include both external and internal hemorrhage as applied to civilian as well as military injuries.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, a hemostatic composition, includes a carrier medium including a predetermined amount of Â£ particulate material. The particulate material is comprised of core particles with a coating. The core particles have an average particle size of about 5 nm to 10 urn, and the coating is one of gold, silica, silver, platinum, steel, cobalt, carbon, a polymer, or a combination thereof.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, a method of controlling bleeding in a subject in need thereof, includes administering to a subject having internal or external bleeding a predetermined amount of a hemostatic fluid including a particulate material in a carrier medium, and applying a magnetic fiera adjacent the site of a lesion or injury causing the bleeding, so as to form a cluster, coagulation, or agglomeration of the particulate material to thereby prevent the flow of blood through the lesion or injury.<br>

Accordingly, the present invention relates to a hemostatic composition comprising:<br>
a)	a carrier medium such as herein described;<br>
b)	a predetermined amount of particulate material in said medium;<br>
d) said particulate material comprising core particles such as herein described with a coating;<br>
d)	said core particles having an average particle size of about 5 nm to 10 urn; and<br>

f)	optionally along with surfactant and/or dispersant.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
 The above and other objects, novel features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description of the invention, as illustrated in the drawings, in which:<br>
	Figure 1 is a schematic illustration showing the formation<br>
of a cluster or agglomeration of the magnetic particles at the site of an injury upon application of a magnetic field;<br>
 Figure 2 is an illustration comparing the size of a typical red blood cell to a 250 nm magnetic particle; and<br>
 Figure 3 illustrates various shapes of the particles for use in the present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides novel approaches to control internal or external hemorrhage using magnetic fluids. The technique can be applied to control bleeding from sites located on the extremities and/or from lacerations involving the femoral or axillary vessels, and also from major vascular or visceral injuries in the body cavities. The novel approach is termed as an Innate Magnetic Tourniquet (IMT). IMT is defined as a tourniquet, which can be applied to all types of hemorrhages (both external and internal), can<br>
selectively arrest bleeding only at the site of an injury or lesion without affecting other healthy areas, and is small so that it is portable. An IMT is one of the objectives of the present invention, which serves to magnetically accelerate the coagulation cascade using coated magnetic particles, and &gt; preferably paramagnetic or superparamagnetic particles, or a combination thereof (see Figure 1).<br>
The particles for use in the present invention may be<br>
synthesized by various methods, such as chemical synthesis, sol-gel, chemical co-precipitation and microwave plasma technique. The microwave plasma technique, described in pending U.S. Application S.N. 09/262,848, filed March 5, 1999 (incorporated herein in its entirety by reference) is the preferred technique as it is unique in that it gives better control over particle size, shape and purity, and can be readily extended to produce different compositions of powders. The composition includes a carrier medium and a particulate material of coated core particles, such as iron, iron oxide, cobalt, cobalt oxide, nickel, nickel oxide, or an alloy or a combination thereof. Preferably, the particulate material includes core particle of iron and its oxides.<br>
The average size of the particles can be from about 5 nm to 10 Âµm The preferred size is about 10 nm to 1 nm, while the most preferred size is about 10 nm to 300 nm. The size of the particles is directly related to toxicity, as the particles should be large enough so that they do not get<br>
absorbed inside the body, and yet small enough to escape the immunological response of the macrophages. In addition, the particle size also directly translates into the magnetic mass of the mixture, thereby affecting the magnetic properties. Figure 2 shows a comparison of a 250 nm particle to a typical red blood cell in size. A typical body cell is about twenty-eight times larger than the particle. Figure 2 also illustrates the importance of proper size selection for the particles.<br>
The shape of the particles is important for two reasons.<br>
First, the magnetic effect is dependent upon the particle volume fraction, which in turn is a function of the particle shape. For instance, needle-shaped particles exhibit similar magnetic effect at concentrations ten times smaller than spherical particles because of larger surface area per volume. Second, the flow characteristics of the particles in a liquid medium are dependent upon their shape. The shapes utilized in this invention include, but are not limited to, spherical, needle-like, cubic, irregular, cylindrical, diamond, oval, or a combination thereof. Figure 3 shows preferred particle shapes.<br>
	In the present invention, the surface coating on the<br>
particles serve several purposes, such as preventing particle agglomeration, rendering the particles biocompatible, preventing dissolution of the magnetic materials, and facilitating either selective interactions with particular biomolecules, such as antibodies and clotting factors, or interactions with specific cell types.<br>
 The types of coatings that may be utilized in the present invention, include silica, gold, silver, platinum, steel, cobalt, carbon, a polymer, procoagulant molecules, or a combination thereof. The polymer can be one of polyethylene glycol, dextran, Tween, sorbitol, mannitol, or a combination thereof. The procoagulant molecules can be thrombin or Factor VII a. The most preferred coating is silica or gold. Silica and gold are both effectively inert with respect to dissolution in biological fluids and both are amenable to many types of surface chemical reactions, allowing the surface of the particles to be engineered for various applications.<br>
Many techniques have been developed for depositing<br>
controlled silica layers on various substrates, including iron and iron oxide based particles. Some approaches make use of controlled hydrolysis of tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) in solutions containing core particles, ethyl alcohol, and ammonium hydroxide. See Azuma, Y. et al. "Coating of ferric oxide particles with silica by hydrolysis of TEOS", Journal of the Ceramic Society of Japan, 100(5), 646-51 (May 1992). The thickness of silica coating can be controlled by varying the reaction conditions.<br>
Other techniques for depositing silica on particles, include<br>
acidification of sodium silicate solutions (Atarashi, T. et al. "Synthesis of ethylene-glycol-based magnetic fluid using silica-coated iron particle", Journal of Magnetism and Magnetic Materials, 201, 7-10 (1999)) or controlled heterocoagulation of silica nanoparticles (5-7 nm) with large core particles (Homola, A. M. et al., "Novel Magnetic Dispersions Using Silica Stabilized<br>
Particles", IEEE Transactions on Magnetics, 22 (5), 716-719 (September 1986).<br>
In the present invention, a precipitation technique is<br>
preferred because of the thin layers that can be achieved. An example of the procedure utilized is provided below in the Example. Sodium silicate is precipitated on the nanoparticle surface to obtain coatings. The amount of sodium silicate can vary from (1 to 80 %) depending upon the thickness of the coating desired. The thickness of the coating can be from about 1 nm and 1 Âµm, but the preferred range is about 5 nm to 50 nm.<br>
 In order to obtain gold coatings, an approach developed by Gin* et al. "AC Magnetic Properties of Compacted FeCo Nanocomposites", Mater. Phys. and Mechanics, 1, 1-10 (2000) for coating iron particles with other transition metals may be utilized. Magnetic particles are placed in a solution of gold chloride (10-80 %), ethylene glycol (5-40 %) and water (15-85 %). The solution is heated, and at high temperatures (between 40 Â°C - 80 Â°C) ethylene glycol acts as a mild reducing agent, resulting in the formation of a thin coating of metallic gold on the nanoparticles. The thickness of the coating can be from about 1 nm to 1 |nm, but the preferred range is about 5 nm to 50 nm.<br>
 For in vivo use, magnetic hemostatic (MH) fluids must incorporate water (or a biological medium, such as blood plasma) as the continuous phase. Therefore, there is a need to stabilize the particles (i.e.,<br>
keep the particles unaggregated and dispersed) in an aqueous carrier fluid, such as water, Ringer's solution, normal saline, sugar solution, blood plasma, or a combination thereof.<br>
Colloidal   particles   have   an   inherent   tendency   to<br>
aggregate and form clusters or agglomerate due to attractive van der Waals (vdW) forces. To stabilize the particles against these attractive forces, it is necessary to introduce a repulsive interparticle force, either by an electrostatic or a steric means. Electrostatic stabilization utilizes the surface charge typically present on the particles, which is effective in a medium having a high dielectric constant, such as water, while in steric stabilization, a sufficiently thick layer of a polymeric or surfactant molecules is introduced around the particles. The surface layer functions as a steric barrier to particle aggregation, and thereby ensures the stability of the fluid. This technique is preferred for the present invention. The steric stabilizer for the particles were chosen from, but are not limited to, polyethylene oxide (PEO), dextran, and PluronicÂ® surfactants (available from BASF).<br>
Magnetic particles are preferably coated with a surfactant<br>
by physical or chemical adsorption in a solution phase. Magnetic particles and surfactants in a ratio of 10:1 are mixed under a high-speed shear and ultrasonic irradiation. However, this range can vary from about 1 to 100%, depending upon various material systems. A typical procedure preferred in<br>
the present invention for polyethylene glycol coating is described in the Example provided below.<br>
The particle concentration in the final fluid can be about<br>
0.1% to 70% (w/w) depending upon the type of hemorrhage. For example, for an external hemorrhage higher concentrations would be preferable than internal bleeding. Coated particles are dispersed in carrier liquids, and mixing is accomplished under high-speed shear and ultrasonification to form a homogeneous fluid.<br>
EXAMPLE<br>
40 nm spherical iron particles are synthesized by utilizing the microwave plasma technique described in pending U.S. Application S.N. 09/262,848, filed March 5, 1999 (incorporated herein in its entirety by reference). The particles are mixed with a 10% aqueous sodium silicate solution to obtain a final iron concentration of 20%. The pH of the solution is maintained at about 10 and the suspension is thoroughly mixed. This is followed by slow heating at a temperature of up to 80Â°C at which silica precipitates out and forms a coating of approximately 10 nm thickness on the surface of iron nanoparticles. The solution is dried in an oven at a temperature of 110Â°C for approximately 12 hours to remove the water. The resulting silica coated iron nanoparticles are dispersed in normal saline at a concentration of 20% using poly(ethylene) glycol (2%) as the surfactant (or dispersing agent).<br><br>
The mixing is accomplished using a high-speed shear mixer for about 3 hours, followed by ultrasonification for about 2 hours. The result is a uniformly dispersed hemostatic fluid which gels upon interaction with an external magnetic field. The magnetic field is generated by using a permanent millimeter sized magnet.<br>
USE AND OPERATION<br>
	In order to control internal or external bleeding, an<br>
effective amount of the hemostatic composition, preferably in the form of a liquid, is administered to a subject in need thereof. The composition is preferably injected intravenously (or via a catheter) adjacent the site of an injury or lesion 10 so that the particles 12 reach the site of injury 10 in, for example, a blood vessel 14 (Figure 1). A magnetic field, in the range of about 0.01-3 Tesla, is then applied by using a conventional permanent magnet 16. Due to magnetic induction, the particles 12 would cluster or agglomerate preventing the flow of blood through the lesion 10.<br>
The composition of the invention may also include a conventional marking agent to allow, for example, a surgeon to track the flow of the particles on a scope, etc., in the event a catheter is used to deliver the composition to control internal bleeding.<br>
	While this invention has been  described as having<br>
preferred sequences, ranges, steps, materials, or designs, it is understood<br>
that it includes further modifications, variations, uses and/or adaptations thereof following in general the principle of the invention, and including such departures from the present disclosure as those come within the known or customary practice in the art to which the invention pertains, and as may be applied to the central features hereinbeforesetforth, and fall within the scope of the invention and of the limits of the appended claims.<br>
