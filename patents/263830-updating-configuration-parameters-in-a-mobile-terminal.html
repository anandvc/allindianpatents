				<td>This invention relates to the secure update of configuration parameters in a<br>
mobile terminal.<br>
Mobile terminals are required to carry a unique hardware identity (ID) such as<br>
IMEI/ESN. The identity is used to trace a particular mobile terminal and can<br>
also be used to block the terminal from accessing the mobile network.<br>
Hence, malicious users are interested in modifying the unique ID of the<br>
terminal, and manufactures need to protect tampering of the terminal ID.<br>
Furthermore, it is also desirable to protect other security critical parameters<br>
of the terminal, for example SIM-lock codes etc. From a security point of view<br>
it would thus be desirable that security critical parameters are never changed<br>
after the terminal has left the factory, e.g. by writing the data in a One-Time-<br>
Programmable (OTP) portion of the memory of the mobile terminal, thereby<br>
preventing subsequent tempering with the data. However, in practice there<br>
are situations where this is not possible/desirable: For example, the flash<br>
memory of the mobile terminal where security sensitive parameters are<br>
stored may have been corrupted, or the hardware ID may need to be<br>
changed, because the terminal has a new owner and some existing user<br>
services might be connected to the terminal ID.<br>
Hence, there is a need for a secure mechanism for updating security<br>
sensitive parameters in a mobile terminal, such as a mobile telephone, a<br>
pager, an electronic organiser, a smart phone, a personal digital assistant<br>
(PDAs), or the like.<br>
US patent no. 6,026,293 discloses a method for preventing electronic<br>
memory tampering in an electronic device. According to this prior art method,<br>
when the electronic device is to be reprogrammed by a data transfer device,<br>
2<br><br>
the electronic device initiates a public/private key based challenge-response<br>
authentication scheme to authenticate the data transfer device. Once<br>
authenticated, the data transfer device is permitted access to reprogram the<br>
memory. Following the reprogramming of the memory, the electronic device<br>
performs a hash calculation of the modified memory contents. The calculated<br>
hash value is sent to the data transfer device for a digital signature, and the<br>
signed hash value is returned to the electronic device for storage. The signed<br>
hash value is subsequently used for auditing the integrity of the memory<br>
content, e.g. during boot-up or periodically.<br>
Even though the above prior art method provides for an integrity protection of<br>
the stored data and security during the update process, it is a problem to<br>
provide a stricter control over the hardware IDs of mobile terminals.<br>
Consequently, it is an object to provide an update method and system that<br>
allows a mobile terminal manufacturer to maintain strict control over the<br>
hardware IDs of the mobile terminal.<br>
It is a further object to provide an efficient update procedure that allows a<br>
world-wide update of hardware IDs and/or other security sensitive<br>
parameters in a customer-friendly way.<br>
The above and other problems are solved by a method of<br>
updating/recovering a configuration parameter of a mobile terminal, the<br>
mobile terminal having stored thereon a public key of a public-key<br>
cryptosystem and a current terminal identifier identifying said mobile terminal,<br>
the method comprising<br>
-   determining at least one updated configuration parameter by an<br>
update/recovery server in response to a received current terminal<br>
identifier from the mobile terminal;<br>
3<br><br>
-	generating an update/recovery data package by a central signing<br>
server,  the  update/recovery data  package  including  the  current<br>
terminal identifier, the at least one updated configuration parameter,<br>
and a digital signature based on a private key, where the digital<br>
signature is verifiable by said public key;<br>
-	storing the current terminal identifier and the at least one updated<br>
configuration parameter by the central signing server;<br>
-	sending the update/recovery data package by the update/recovery<br>
server to the mobile terminal causing the mobile terminal to verify the<br>
received update/recovery data package and to store the at least one<br>
updated configuration parameter of the verified update/recovery data<br>
package in the mobile terminal.<br>
In particular, since the update procedure is performed by a number of<br>
decentralised update/recovery servers, an efficient update process is<br>
ensured while maintaining strict centralised control over the hardware ID via<br>
the central signing server.<br>
Since the system allows a plurality of update/recovery servers, it is an<br>
advantage that a compromised update/recovery server can easily be blocked<br>
from future use without significantly reducing the efficiency of the update<br>
system as a whole, since there are still a number of alternative<br>
update/recovery servers operational.<br>
It is a further advantage that a secure, strictly controlled update processes for<br>
the security sensitive parameters of a mobile terminal is provided.<br>
Furthermore, if cloned mobile terminals appear on the market or terminals<br>
that are otherwise tampered with, the update process and system described<br>
herein allows an easy detection of the current hardware ID of the mobile<br>
terminal and/or the identity of the update/recovery server used to change the<br>
4<br><br>
hardware ID of the terminal. Hence, it is an advantage that the method<br>
described herein facilitates an easy tracing of illegal tampering with the<br>
mobile terminal and dishonest service centres for mobile terminals.<br>
It is a further advantage that, once an update/recovery package is sent to a<br>
terminal, the logging of the data prevents a reuse of that package in a replay<br>
attack.<br>
The term update/recovery server is intended to include any computer or other<br>
data processing system that is adapted to update the hardware ID and/or<br>
other security sensitive parameters of a mobile terminal and/or adapted to<br>
recover a corrupted hardware ID and/or other security sensitive parameters<br>
of a mobile terminal. The term signing server is intended to include any<br>
suitably programmed/configured computer or other data processing system.<br>
The term configuration parameter is intended to include any parameter<br>
stored in the mobile terminal, in particular any data item for which a secure<br>
update procedure is desirable. In the following such configuration parameters<br>
will also be referred to as security parameters. In particular, the term<br>
configuration parameter comprises a hardware identifier identifying the<br>
mobile terminal, e.g. an IMEI and an ESN. The IMEI (International Mobile<br>
Equipment Identity) is a unique number given to every mobile phone. A list of<br>
all IMEIs on the network is stored in an Equipment Identity Register (EIR).<br>
The ESN (Electronic Serial Number) is a unique serial number used in the<br>
United States and given to a handset at the time of manufacture. Further<br>
examples of security-sensitive configuration parameters include SIM-lock<br>
codes, phone domains, root certificates, security policies, etc.<br>
In one embodiment, the method further comprises comparing, by the central<br>
signing server, at least one of the current terminal identifier and a generated<br>
updated terminal identifier with an ID repository to determine whether the<br>
5<br><br>
corresponding current or updated terminal identifier is blocked. Hence, the<br>
method provides a protection against unauthorised updates of previously<br>
invalidated terminal IDs e.g. in order to circumvent the black-listing of a<br>
stolen terminal.<br>
According to one embodiment, the method further comprises sending the<br>
current terminal identifier and the at least one updated configuration<br>
parameter by the update/recovery server to the signings server.<br>
In one embodiment, the method further comprises receiving an indication<br>
from the mobile terminal that the current terminal identifier is corrupted; and<br>
receiving a pseudo terminal identifier generated by the mobile terminal as the<br>
current terminal identifier. Consequently, the method provides a secure and<br>
efficient process for recovering mobile terminals with corrupted configuration<br>
parameters, i.e. mobile terminals that can no longer access one or more of its<br>
configuration parameters.<br>
In another embodiment, the pseudo terminal identifier is a message<br>
authentication code value calculated from a device dependant key of the<br>
mobile terminal. It is an advantage that the mobile terminal subsequently can<br>
verify the pseudo terminal identifier when receiving a recovery package and,<br>
thus, may accept an updated/recovered ID only, if the mobile terminal has<br>
detected that the current ID is corrupted.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the method further comprises receiving a random<br>
number from the mobile terminal by the update/recovery server; and<br>
generating an update/recovery data package comprises including the random<br>
number in the digital signature of the update/recovery data package.<br>
Consequently, due to the random number, a previously issued recovery<br>
package cannot be used in a replay attack.<br>
6<br><br>
When the method further comprises verification by the central signing server<br>
whether the update/recovery server is authorised to update the mobile<br>
terminal, a mechanism is provided for detecting unauthorised<br>
update/recovery servers which may then easily be blocked from future use,<br>
thereby facilitating the prevention of dishonest service centres for mobile<br>
terminals.<br>
When the update/recovery data package comprises a digital certificate<br>
certifying the holder of the private key of the update/recovery data package,<br>
the security is further increased, because the update/recovery server and/or<br>
the mobile terminal can verify the authenticity of the update/recovery data<br>
package. In one embodiment, the digital certificate comprises an<br>
update/recovery flag indicating that the holder of the private key is authorised<br>
to update/recover the mobile terminal with the at least one updated<br>
configuration parameter. Alternatively or additionally, the digital certificate<br>
comprises a manufacturer identifier identifying a manufacturer of the mobile<br>
terminal, allowing the mobile terminal to compare the manufacturer identifier<br>
with a corresponding manufacturer identifier stored in the mobile terminal.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the sending of the update/recovery data package<br>
by the update/recovery server to the mobile terminal further causes the<br>
mobile terminal to generate and store a message authentication code of the<br>
received at least one updated configuration parameter. Consequently, the<br>
received updated configuration parameter is stored integrity protected,<br>
thereby facilitating a subsequent verification of the integrity of the stored<br>
parameter by the mobile terminal.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the method further comprises sending a loader<br>
program to the mobile terminal, said loader program being adapted, when<br>
executed on the mobile terminal, to perform at least the generating of said<br>
message  authentication  code  of the  received   at  least  one  updated<br>
7<br><br>
configuration parameter. Hence, the calculation of the reference message<br>
authentication code for use during a subsequent memory audit is performed<br>
by software that does not normally reside on the mobile terminal, thereby<br>
reducing the risk of a hacker or other malicious user gaining access to that<br>
functionality. While the reference message authentication code is made<br>
available for storage by the program calculating it, the subsequent audit<br>
process does not need to output the calculated audit message authentication<br>
code but merely a result of the comparison with the stored reference code.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, at least the generation of the message<br>
authentication code of the received at least one updated configuration<br>
parameter and/or the verification of the update package is performed by<br>
protected boot ROM (Read Only Memory) code or integrity-protected boot<br>
code of the mobile terminal.<br>
It is noted that the features of the method described above and in the<br>
following may be implemented in software and carried out on a data<br>
processing system comprising one or more processing means caused by the<br>
execution of program code means such as computer-executable instructions.<br>
Here and in the following, the term processing means comprises any circuit<br>
and/or device suitably adapted to perform the above functions. In particular,<br>
the above term comprises general- or special-purpose programmable<br>
microprocessors, Digital Signal Processors (DSP), Application Specific<br>
Integrated Circuits (ASIC), Programmable Logic Arrays (PLA), Field<br>
Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA), special purpose electronic circuits, etc.,<br>
or a combination thereof.<br>
The present invention can be implemented in different ways including the<br>
method described above and in the following, corresponding devices, and<br>
computer programs, each yielding one or more of the benefits and<br>
advantages described in connection with the above-mentioned method, and<br>
each having one or more embodiments corresponding to the embodiments<br>
described in connection with the above-mentioned method.<br>
8<br><br>
More specifically, according to a further aspect, the above problems are<br>
solved by a system for updating/recovering a configuration parameter of a<br>
mobile terminal, the mobile terminal having stored thereon a public key of a<br>
public-key cryptosystem and a current terminal identifier identifying said<br>
mobile terminal, the system comprising<br>
at least one update/recovery server adapted to determine at least one<br>
updated configuration parameter in response to a received current terminal<br>
identifier from the mobile terminal; and<br>
a central signing server adapted to<br>
-	generate an  update/recovery data  package including the current<br>
terminal identifier, the at least one updated configuration parameter,<br>
and a digital signature based on a private key, where the digital<br>
signature is verifiable by said public key; and<br>
-	to store the current terminal identifier and the at least one updated<br>
configuration parameter by the central signing server;<br>
the update/recovery server being further adapted to send the<br>
update/recovery data package to the mobile terminal causing the mobile<br>
terminal to verify the received update/recovery data package and to store<br>
the at least one updated configuration parameter of the verified<br>
update/recovery data package in the mobile terminal.<br>
In one embodiment, the update/recovery server and the signing server are<br>
connected via a secure communications link.<br>
According to a yet further aspect, the above problems are solved by a signing<br>
server for updating/recovering a configuration parameter of a mobile terminal,<br>
the mobile terminal having stored thereon a public key of a public-key<br>
9<br><br>
cryptosystem and a current terminal identifier identifying said mobile terminal,<br>
wherein the signing server is configured<br>
-	to receive at least one updated configuration parameter generated by<br>
an update/recovery server in response to a received current terminal<br>
identifier from the mobile terminal;<br>
-	to generate an update/recovery data package including the current<br>
terminal identifier, the at least one updated configuration parameter,<br>
and a digital signature based on a private key, where the digital<br>
signature is verifiable by said public key;<br>
-	to store the current terminal identifier and the at least one updated<br>
configuration parameter; and<br>
-	to send the update/recovery data package to the update/recovery<br>
server    causing    the    update/recovery   server   to    forward    the<br>
update/recovery data package to the mobile terminal and causing the<br>
mobile terminal to verify the received update/recovery data package<br>
and to store the at least one updated configuration parameter of the<br>
verified update/recovery data package in the mobile terminal.<br>
In one embodiment, the signing server is further adapted to compare at least<br>
one of the current terminal identifier and a generated updated terminal<br>
identifier with an ID repository to determine whether the corresponding<br>
current or updated terminal identifier is blocked.<br>
In another embodiment, the signing server is further adapted to verify<br>
whether the update/recovery server is authorised to update the mobile<br>
terminal.<br>
According to a yet further aspect, the above problems are solved by an<br>
update/recovery server for updating/recovering a configuration parameter of<br>
a mobile terminal, the mobile terminal having stored thereon a public key of<br>
10<br><br>
a public-key cryptosystem and a current terminal identifier identifying said<br>
mobile terminal, wherein the update/recovery server is configured<br>
-	to generate at least one updated configuration parameter in response<br>
to a received current terminal identifier from the mobile terminal;<br>
-	to send the current terminal identifier and the at least one updated<br>
configuration parameter to a signing server causing the signing server<br>
to generate an update/recovery data package including the current<br>
terminal identifier, the at least one updated configuration parameter,<br>
and a digital signature based on a private key, where the digital<br>
signature is verifiable by said public key, and to store the current<br>
terminal   identifier  and   the   at   least  one   updated   configuration<br>
parameter by the central signing server;<br>
-	to receive the update/recovery data package from the signing server;<br>
and<br>
-	to send the update/recovery data package to the mobile terminal to<br>
cause the mobile terminal to verify the received update/recovery data<br>
package and to store the at least one updated configuration parameter<br>
of the verified update/recovery data package in the mobile terminal.<br>
In one embodiment, the update/recovery server is further adapted to receive<br>
an indication from the mobile terminal that the current terminal identifier is<br>
corrupted; and to receive a pseudo terminal identifier generated by the<br>
mobile terminal as the current terminal identifier.<br>
In one embodiment, the pseudo terminal identifier is a message<br>
authentication code value calculated from a device dependant key of the<br>
mobile terminal.<br>
In one embodiment, the update/recovery server is further adapted to receive<br>

computer program product comprising computer program code means<br>
adapted to perform the steps of the method described above and in the<br>
following, when said computer program is run on the data processing system.<br>
In particular, the computer program product may comprise respective<br>
computer program code modules to be executed on the update/recovery<br>
server and on the signing server.<br>
For example, the program code means may be loaded in a memory, such as<br>
a Random Access Memory (RAM), from a storage medium or from another<br>
computer via a computer network. Alternatively, the described features may<br>
be implemented by hardwired circuitry instead of software or in combination<br>
with software.<br>
According to a yet further aspect, the above problems are solved by a data<br>
processing system configured to perform the steps of the method described<br>
above and in the following.<br>
The above and other aspects will be apparent and elucidated from the<br>
embodiments described in the following with reference to the drawing in<br>
which:<br>
Fig. 1 shows a schematic block diagram of a system for updating/recovering<br>
configuration parameters of a mobile terminal;<br><br>
Fig. 2 shows a schematic block diagram of an example of a mobile terminal;<br>
Fig. 3 shows a flow diagram of an embodiment of a method for updating<br>
configuration parameters of a mobile terminal;<br>
Fig. 4 shows a flow diagram of an embodiment of a method for recovering<br>
corrupted configuration parameters of a mobile terminal;<br>
Fig. 5 shows a flow diagram of another embodiment of a method for<br>
updating/recovering corrupted configuration parameters of a mobile terminal.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a schematic block diagram of a system for updating/recovering<br>
configuration parameters of a mobile terminal. The system comprises a<br>
central signing server 101 with access to an ID repository 102, and a number<br>
of update/recovery servers 103,103', and 103"'.<br>
In fig. 1, three update/recovery servers are shown as an example. However,<br>
it will be appreciated that a different number of update/recovery servers is<br>
possible. The update/recovery servers 103,103', and 103" perform the<br>
update of hardware IDs and/or other security parameters of mobile terminals<br>
and/or the recovery of corrupted hardware IDs and/or other security<br>
parameters. It is understood that each server 103,103', 103" may be<br>
adapted to perform both parameter updates and parameter recoveries, i.e.<br>
they may have the role of an update server and of a recovery server. In some<br>
embodiments, however, some or all servers may act only as either an update<br>
server or a recovery server. In the present description, the terms update<br>
server and recovery server are merely used in order to illustrate the role of<br>
the respective server. Use of the term update server is not intended to imply<br>
that the server is only adapted to perform parameter updates. Similarly, use<br>
of the term recovery server is not intended to imply that the server is only<br>
adapted to perform parameter recoveries.<br>
13<br><br>
The ID repository 102 may be a database separate from the signing server or<br>
it may be an internal database of the signing server, e.g. an internal signing<br>
log storage. When a single signing server handles all updates of terminals<br>
from the same manufacturer, a strict centralised control is provided.<br>
However, a system with a small number of signing servers, e.g. 2, 3, or 4, is<br>
possible as well. In this case, the signing servers may have access to the<br>
same ID repository or to synchronised repositories. In one embodiment, the<br>
ID repository 102 for logging updates of the hardware IDs is collocated with<br>
the EIR. Each signing server is responsible for generating update/recovery<br>
packages for a plurality of update/recovery servers, thereby providing an<br>
efficient system allowing the servicing of a large number of mobile terminals.<br>
Each update/recovery server can communicate with one or more mobile<br>
terminals at the same time. In the example of fig. 1, three mobile terminals<br>
104,104', and 104" are shown in communication with update/recovery server<br>
103, and two mobile terminals 104'" and 104"" in communication with<br>
update/recovery server 103". It is understood that the signing server may be<br>
integrated with one of the update/recovery servers, e.g. one server computer<br>
may function both as the central signing server and as one of the<br>
update/recovery servers.<br>
The update/recovery servers communicate with the mobile terminals via a<br>
suitable communications link. For example, the update/recovery servers may<br>
communicate with the mobile terminals over-the-air, i.e. via a cellular<br>
telecommunications network. In other embodiments an update/recovery<br>
server may communicate with a mobile terminal via a local communications<br>
link, e.g. a short range wireless communications channel, such as a radio-<br>
based channel, e.g. Bluetooth, or an infrared communications channel, e.g.<br>
IrDa. Furthermore, the update/recovery server may communicate with a<br>
mobile terminal via a wired connection, e.g. a serial port such as USB,<br>
FireWire, or the like.<br>
14<br><br>
The update/recovery servers communicate with the signing server via<br>
respective communications channels 105,105', 105". The connection may<br>
be a local connection, e.g. a Local Area Network (LAN), a Wireless Local<br>
area Network (WLAN), or the like, or a remote connection, e.g. via the<br>
Internet or another communications network. When the connection between<br>
the update/recovery server and the signing server is confidentiality and<br>
integrity protected and/or when a mutual authentication between the update<br>
and signing server takes place, the security of the system is increased, in<br>
particular if a remote connection is used. For example, the connection<br>
between the update/recovery server and the signing server may utilise TLS<br>
(Transport Layer Security) with server and client authentication or another<br>

Fig. 2 shows a schematic block diagram of an example of a mobile terminal.<br>
The mobile terminal 104 comprises a communications circuit 206 and an<br>
antenna connected to the communications circuit for communicating via a<br>
cellular telecommunications network, e.g. a GSM network, GPRS network, a<br>
UMTS network, or any other suitable communications network. Additionally,<br>
the mobile terminal 104 may comprise further data communications<br>
interfaces, e.g. an IrDa port, a serial interface e.g. USB, Firewire, or the like,<br>
a Bluetooth interface, and/or the like. The mobile terminal 104 further<br>
comprises a processing unit 207 and a memory 208. The memory 208 may<br>
comprise one or more physically and/or logically separated memory sections.<br>
For example, the mobile terminal may comprise a RAM and one or more<br>
non-volatile memory/memories, e.g. a ROM and a re-writable memory, e.g. a<br>
flash memory.<br>
The mobile terminal 104 is pre-configured with a public root key 211 of a<br>
public-key cryptosystem. The key 211 may be stored in a protected non-<br>
volatile memory such as a ROM, thereby providing a high level of security.<br>
15<br><br>
The key is used to check the correctness of all updates or recovery of the<br>
security critical parameters of the terminal 104.<br>
Furthermore, the terminal 104 has stored thereon a unique hardware ID 209<br>
such as an IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identifier) and/or an ESN<br>
(Electronic Serial Number). In addition to the hardware ID 209, the mobile<br>
terminal may have stored thereon other security sensitive parameters 210<br>
such as a SIM-unlock code and/or the like. The hardware ID 209 and the<br>
optional further parameters 210 are stored protected in a terminal non-<br>
volatile memory that can be rewritten. The data may be protected with a hash<br>
value, a message authentication code, or the like, e.g. as described in US<br>
6,026,293 where the mobile terminal microprocessor performs a hash<br>
calculation on the content of the terminal memory to derive an audit hash<br>
value, which is compared with a securely stored or a digitally signed pre-<br>
calculated hash value. Only if the two hash values agree, the memory<br>
content is accepted. For example, such an authentication code may be<br>
checked each time the terminal boots and if the check fails, the terminal will<br>
not run with full functionality.<br>
In the following two scenarios will be described with reference to figs. 3 and<br>
4, respectively: The update of terminal security parameters and a security<br>
parameters recovery procedure in case the parameters of a mobile terminal<br>
are corrupted and/or unreadable.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a flow diagram of an embodiment of a method for updating<br>
configuration parameters of a mobile terminal 104 by an update server 103.<br>
In this embodiment, the server 103 will be referred to as an update server. It<br>
is understood however, that this terminology merely refers to a server role in<br>
the update/recovery process. It will be recognised that the same server<br>
computer may act both as update as well as recovery server.<br>
16<br><br>
In initial steps 301 and 302 performed by the update server 103 and the<br>
mobile terminal 104, respectively, the update server and the mobile terminal<br>
establish a local or remote, wired or wireless, connection with each other. In<br>
some embodiments, the update server initiates this process, while in other<br>
embodiments the terminal connects to the update server. As part of step 301,<br>
the update server 103 sends an update request to the terminal 104.<br>
In step 303, the mobile terminal 104 returns the current hardware ID,<br>
designated IDC, and, optionally, the current values of further security<br>
parameters to the update server 104. The mobile terminal 104 generates and<br>
also sends a random value rand to the update server.<br>
In step 304, the update server 103 chooses the new terminal parameters, i.e.<br>
the new hardware ID, designated IDN, and/or new values of the other security<br>
parameters. Typically, the update server selects the new parameters in<br>
response to an input from a user of the update server, e.g. an operator at a<br>
service location. The actual selection of parameters may be performed by the<br>
update server under control of the user, or the updated parameters may be<br>
entered by the user. For example, the update server may select a new<br>
hardware ID from a pool of available IDs if a new hardware ID is requested<br>
by the user in connection with a change in subscription. In another scenario<br>
the mobile terminal may be transferred from one phone domain (e.g. type of<br>
phone, product, R&amp;D) to another, e.g. for test purposes. In this scenario, the<br>
domain parameters of the mobile terminal are changed accordingly by the<br>
update server upon request from the operator. It is understood that a<br>
parameter update may include an update of the hardware ID or it may merely<br>
be an update of other security sensitive parameters while maintaining the<br>
hardware ID constant.<br>
In steps 305 and 306 performed by the update server 103 and a signing<br>
server 101, respectively, a connection is established between the update<br>
17<br><br>
server 103 and the signing server 101 (uniess the signing server is collocated<br>
with the update server) via a suitable communications channel, e.g. as<br>
described in connection with fig. 1 above.<br>
In step 307, the update server 103 sends the new and current values of the<br>
hardware ID and the corresponding current and new values of the security<br>
parameters to the signing server 101 together with the random value rand<br>
received from the mobile terminal 104.<br>
In step 308, the signing server 101 checks that the update server 103 is<br>
authorized to perform a terminal update. In particular, the signing server<br>
verifies the current (and optionally the new) hardware ID of the terminal. To<br>
this end, the signing server 101 includes functionality for blocking updates of<br>
certain IDs, e.g. by maintaining a list of blocked IDs. Hence, the verification of<br>
the new and/or current ID(s) may include a comparison of the new and/or<br>
current ID(s) with the IDs on the list of blocked IDs. If the update server is<br>
authorized for updates and if the requested current terminal or new terminal<br>
ID is not blocked, the signing server proceeds with the updating procedure at<br>
step 309; otherwise the process is aborted.<br>
In step 309, the signing server 101 creates a signed update package with the<br>
new terminal security parameters. The signed update package includes the<br>
new terminal parameters including the new terminal hardware ID as well as<br>
the current terminal hardware ID. In some embodiments, the package further<br>
includes a digital certificate. The update package is signed with a signature<br>
based either on the private key corresponding to the public root key 211 in<br>
the mobile terminal or a private key that is certified through a private key<br>
corresponding to the public root key 211 in the terminal. Furthermore, in<br>
some embodiments, the certificate certifying the signing key contains an<br>
update flag that indicates that the holder of the private key is authorized to<br>
perform a security parameter update. The certificate may also include a field<br>
19<br><br>
with the ID of the manufacturer of the mobile terminal. When the signature is<br>
computed including the random value rand, replay attacks are prevented.<br>
In step 310, the signing server 101 stores the new parameters, the terminal<br>
ID(s) (current and possible new ID) and the update server identity in the ID<br>
repository 102.<br>
In subsequent step 311, the signing server 101 sends the signed update<br>
package back to the upgrade server 103.<br>
In step 312, the upgrade server 103 sends the received update package to<br>
the mobile terminal 104.<br>
In step 313, the mobile terminal 104 receives the update package from the<br>
update server 103. Upon receipt of the update package, the mobile terminal<br>
checks the certificate and signature of the update package using its public<br>
root key 211. If the certificate contains an update flag field and/or a<br>
manufacturer field, this/these fields are also checked. To this end, the<br>
terminal may have the ID of its manufacturer stored in, for example, an OTP<br>
memory. Next, the terminal checks the current hardware ID in the update<br>
package against its own current ID. If the two values agree, the terminal<br>
proceeds with the update. The old security parameters are deleted from the<br>
memory and the new parameters are stored in the terminal memory. The<br>
new ID and parameters may be securely stored in a terminal non-volatile<br>
memory.<br>
In embodiments in which the security parameters stored on the mobile<br>
terminal are protected with an authentication code, the mobile terminal<br>
calculates a corresponding authentication code (MAC) of the received new<br>
parameters and stores the authentication code together with the new<br>
parameters.<br><br>
Fig. 4 shows a flow diagram of an embodiment of a method for recovering<br>
corrupted configuration parameters of a mobile terminal. Hence, in this<br>
scenario it is assumed that one or more of the security sensitive parameters<br>
of the mobile terminal are corrupted, i.e. cannot be retrieved by the mobile<br>
terminal any longer. In this embodiment, the server 103 will be referred to as<br>
a recovery server. It is understood however, that this terminology merely<br>
refers to a server role in the update/recovery process. It will be recognised<br>
that the same server computer may act both as update as well as recovery<br>
server.<br>
In initial steps 401 and 402 performed by the recovery server 103 and the<br>
mobile terminal 104, respectively, the recovery server and the mobile<br>
terminal establish a local or remote, wired or wireless, connection with each<br>
other. In some embodiments, the recovery server initiates this process, while<br>
in other embodiments the terminal connects to the recovery server.<br>
It is understood that a parameter recovery may include a recovery of the<br>
hardware ID or it may merely be a recovery of other security sensitive<br>
parameters while maintaining the hardware ID constant. In the following, it is<br>
assumed that the hardware ID is unreadable. It is understood that the<br>
recovery process is performed analogously in the case of other security<br>
parameters being corrupted.<br>
In step 420, the mobile terminal generates a random value rand and a<br>
pseudo identity PSID defined as PSID=DEVMAC(rand), where DEVMAC is a<br>
MAC using a device dependent key. For example, the device dependant key,<br>
may be a unique key for the chipset of the mobile terminal, e.g. a key that is<br>
programmed during production. When the device dependant key is stored<br>
such that it cannot be extracted from the chip, the security of the generation<br>
of the PSID is further increased.<br>
20<br><br>
In subsequent step 403, the mobile terminal 104 sends a status message to<br>
the recovery server 103 indicating that one or more security parameters are<br>
unreadable (or if they are not, abort the process). The mobile terminal also<br>
sends the random value rand and the pseudo identity PSID to the recovery<br>
server 103.<br>
In step 404, the recovery server 103 chooses the new terminal parameters,<br>
i.e. the new hardware ID, designated IDN, and optionally new values of the<br>
other security parameters, e.g. as described above. In some embodiments<br>
the hardware ID and/or some or all of the other parameters may be<br>
recovered from a suitable database.<br>
In steps 405 and 406 performed by the recovery server 103 and a signing<br>
server 101, respectively, a connection is established between the recovery<br>
server 103 and the signing server 101 (unless the signing server is collocated<br>
with the recovery server) via a suitable communications channel, e.g. as<br>
described in connection with fig. 1 above.<br>
In step 407, the recovery server 103 sends the new hardware ID and the<br>
pseudo identifier PSID and optionally new and current values of the other<br>
security parameters to the signing server 101 together the random value rand<br>
received from the mobile terminal 104.<br>
In step 408, the signing server 101 checks that the recovery server 103 is<br>
authorized to perform a terminal recovery. In particular, the signing server<br>
verifies the new hardware ID of the terminal. To this end, the signing server<br>
101 includes functionality for blocking updates to certain IDs, e.g. by<br>
maintaining a list of blocked IDs. For example, some ranges of IDs are used<br>
in phones where the ID is programmed in one-time-programmable memory.<br>
Accordingly, in some embodiments it may be desirable to block updates to<br>
21<br><br>
IDs from these ranges. Hence, the verification of the new ID may include a<br>
comparison of the new ID with the IDs on the list of blocked IDs. If the<br>
recovery server is authorized for recovery and if the requested new terminal<br>
ID is not blocked, the signing server proceeds with the recovery procedure at<br>
step 409; otherwise the process is aborted.<br>
In step 409, the signing server 101 creates a signed recovery package with<br>
the new terminal security parameters. The signed recovery package includes<br>
the new terminal parameters as well as the pseudo identifier PSID. In some<br>
embodiments, the package further includes a digital certificate. The recovery<br>
package is signed with a signature based either on the private key<br>
corresponding to the public root key 211 in the mobile terminal or a private<br>
key that is certified through a private key corresponding to the public root key<br>
211 in the terminal. Furthermore, in some embodiments, the certificate<br>
certifying the signing key contains a recovery flag that indicates that the<br>
holder of the private key is authorized to perform a security parameter<br>
recovery. The certificate may also include a field with the ID of the<br>
manufacturer of the mobile terminal. When the signature is computed<br>
including the random value rand, replay attacks are prevented.<br>
In step 410, the signing server 101 stores the new terminal ID, the pseudo<br>
identifier and optionally the new parameters together with the identity of the<br>
recovery server in the ID repository 102.<br>
In subsequent step 411, the signing server 101 sends the signed recovery<br>
package back to the recovery server 103.<br>
In step 412, the recovery server 103 sends the received recovery package to<br>
the mobile terminal 104.<br>
22<br><br>
In step 413, the mobile terminal 104 receives the recovery package from the<br>
recovery server 103. Upon receipt of the recovery package, the mobile<br>
terminal checks the certificate and signature of the recovery package using<br>
its public root key 211. If the certificate contains a recovery flag field and/or a<br>
manufacturer field, this/these fields are also checked. To this end, the<br>
terminal may have the ID of its manufacturer stored in, for example, an OTP<br>
memory. Next, the terminal checks the pseudo identifier PSID received in the<br>
recovery package against the PSID generated by it in step 420. If the two<br>
values agree, the terminal proceeds with the recovery. The new hardware ID<br>
and optionally further parameters are stored in the terminal memory. For<br>
example, the new JD and parameters are securely stored in a terminal non-<br>
volatile memory.<br>
In embodiments in which the security parameters stored on the mobile<br>
terminal are protected with an authentication code, the mobile terminal<br>
calculates a corresponding message authentication code (MAC) of the<br>
received new parameters and stores the message authentication code<br>
(MAC) together with the new parameters.<br>
In some situations the mobile terminal may not be able to contact the server,<br>
e.g. because the current terminal identity has been blacklisted, or because<br>
the device is malfunctioning and is sent in for repair. Furthermore, when the<br>
steps 313 and 413 include a recalculation of a message authentication code<br>
(MAC) as described above, it may be disadvantageous from a security point<br>
of view to have the MAC recalculation capability available as part of the<br>
normal software stored in the mobile terminal.<br>
The above problems are solved when the update/recovery server initially<br>
sends a trusted loader software to the mobile terminal and when the loader<br>
software subsequently performs the communication and some or all of the<br>
further steps to be taken in the mobile terminal, in particular the calculation of<br>
23<br><br>
the MAC. An embodiment of an update process utilising a loader software<br>
will now be described with reference to fig. 5.<br>
Fig. 5 shows a flow diagram of another embodiment of a method for updating<br>
configuration parameters of a mobile terminal. The method of fig. 5 is similar<br>
to the method described in connection with fig. 3, but with an initial loading<br>
stage of the loader software. It is understood that a recovery process of fig. 4<br>
may be modified in the same way in order to utilise a loader software.<br>
In initial step 531, an update server 103 sends a loader software to the<br>
mobile terminal 104. This trusted loader includes functionality adapted to<br>
recalculate the MAC value of the updated parameters. Methods for loading<br>
software into a mobile terminal are known and will not be described here in<br>
detail. In one embodiment the loader software is digitally signed with a secret<br>
private key and the matching public key is stored integrity protected in the<br>
mobile terminal. For example, the public key may be stored in ROM or in<br>
one-time-programmable memory of the digital ASIC of the mobile terminal.<br>
Accordingly, in step 532 upon receipt of the loader software, the mobile<br>
terminal verifies the authenticity of the received loader.<br>
Subsequently, the mobile terminal executes the loader software, and the<br>
loader software establishes a communications link with the update server<br>
(steps 533 and 534 performed by the update server and by the mobile<br>
terminal under the control of the loader software, respectively).<br>
The remaining steps 303-313 are identical to the corresponding steps<br>
described in connection with fig. 3 and will not be described again here. In<br>
the embodiment of fig. 5, the steps 533, 303, and 313 performed by the<br>
mobile terminal are performed by, or under the control of, the loader<br>
software, as indicated by the dashed-dotted line 535.<br>
24<br><br>
Hence, in this embodiment, the security of the update process is increased,<br>
since, the MAC recalculation capability is only available as part of the loader<br>
software that does not normally reside on the mobile terminal. Furthermore,<br>
when also the remaining updating steps on the mobile terminal are<br>
performed by the loader software, the updating process may be performed<br>
even in situations when the mobile terminal software is not able to perform<br>
the update any longer.<br>
Although some embodiments have been described and shown in detail, the<br>
invention is not restricted to them, but may also be embodied in other ways<br>
within the scope of the subject matter defined in the following claims.<br>
In particular, the embodiments have mainly been described with reference to<br>
a mobile terminal as an example of a data processing device. It is<br>
understood, however, that the described method, system, devices, and<br>
product means may also applied to other data processing devices having<br>
security critical configuration parameters that require updating.<br>
The invention can be implemented by means of hardware comprising several<br>
distinct elements, and by means of a suitably programmed microprocessor.<br>
In the device claims enumerating several means, several of these means can<br>
be embodied by one and the same item of hardware, e.g. a suitably<br>
programmed microprocessor, one or more digital signal processor, or the<br>
like. The mere fact that certain measures are recited in mutually different<br>
dependent claims or described in different embodiments does not indicate<br>
that a combination of these measures cannot be used to advantage.<br>
It should be emphasized that the term "comprises/comprising" when used in<br>
this specification is taken to specify the presence of stated features, integers,<br>
steps or components but does not preclude the presence or addition of one<br>
or more other features, integers, steps, components or groups thereof.<br>
