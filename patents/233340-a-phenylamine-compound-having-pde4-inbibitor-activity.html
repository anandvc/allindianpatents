This application claims benefit of U.S. Provisional application Serial No. 60/262,651, filed January 22, 2001, U.S. provisional application Serial No. 60/267,196, filed February 8, 2001, and U.S. Provisional application Serial No. 60/306,140, filed July 14,2001.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to the field of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) enzyme inhibition. More specifically this invention relates to selective PDE4 inhibition by novel compounds, e.g., N-substituted aniline and diphenylamine analogs, methods of preparing such compounds, compositions containing such compounds, and methods of use thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The cyclic nucleotide specific phosphodiesterases (PDEs) represent a family of enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of various-cyclic nucleoside monophosphates (including cAMP and cGMP). These cyclic nucleotides act as second messengers within cells, and as messengers, carry impulses from cell surface receptors having bound various hormones and neurotransmitters. PDEs act to regulate the level of cyclic nucleotides within cells and maintain cyclic nucleotide homeostasis by degrading such cyclic mononucleotides resulting in termination of their messenger role.<br>
PDE enzymes can be grouped into eleven families according to their specificity toward hydrolysis of  c AMP or cGMP, their sensitivity to regulation by calcium, calmodulin or cGMP, and their selective inhibition by various compounds. For example, PDE' 1 is stimulated by Ca2-/calmoduim. PDE 2 is cGMP-dependent, and is found in the heart and adrenals. PDE 3 is cGMP-dependent, and inhibition .of this enzyme creates positive inotropic activity. PDE 4 is cAMP specific, and its inhibition causes airway     relaxation, antiinflammatory and antidepressant activity. PDE 5 appears to be important<br><br>
in regulating cGMP content in vascular smooth muscle, and therefore PDE 5 inhibitors<br>
may have cardiovascular activity. Since the PDEs possess distinct biochemical properties,<br>
it is likely that they are subject to a variety of different forms of regulation.<br>
PDE4 is distinguished by various kinetic properties including low Michaelis<br>
constant for cAMP and sensitivity to certain drugs. The PDE4 enzyme family consists of<br>
four genes, which produce 4 isoforms of the PDE4 enzyme designated PDE4A, PDE4B,<br>
PDE4C, and PD'E4D [See: Wang et al, Expression, Purification, and Characterization of<br>
human cAMP-Specific Phosphodiesterase (PDE4) Subtypes A, B, C, and D, Biochem.<br>
Biophys. Res. Comm., 234, 320-324 (1997)] In addition, various splice variants of each<br>
PDE4 isoform have been identified.<br>
PDE4 isoenzymes are localized in-the cytosol of cells and are unassociated with any<br>
known membranous structures. PDE4 isoenzymes specifically inactivate cAMP by<br>
catalyzing its hydrolysis to adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP). Regulation of cAMP<br>
activity is important in many biological processes, including inflammation and memory.<br>
Inhibitors of PDE4 isoenzymes such as rolipram, piclamilast, CDP-840 and ariflo are<br>
powerful anthnflanimator/ agents and therefore may be useful in treating diseases where<br>
inflammation is problematic such as asthma or arthritis. Further, rolipram improves the<br>
cognitive performance of rats and mice in learning paradigms.<br>
rolipram piclamilast<br>
In addition to such compounds as roiipram, xanthine derivatives such as<br>
pentoxifylline, denbufylline, and theophylline inhibit PDE4 and have received<br>
considerable attention of late for their cognition enhancing effects. cAMP and cGMP are<br>
second messengers that mediate cellular responses to many different hormones and<br>
neurotransmitters. Thus, therapeutically significant effects may result from PDE<br>
inhibition and the resulting increase in intracellular cAMP or cGMP in key ceils, such as<br>
those located in the nervous system and elsewhere in the body.<br>
Roiipram, previously in development as an anti-depressant, selectively inhibits<br>
the PDE4 enzyme and has become a standard agent in the classification of PDE enzyme<br>
subtypes. Early work in the PDE4 field focused on depression and inflammation, and has<br>
subsequently been extended to include indications such as dementia, [see "The PDE TV<br>
Family Of Calcium-Phosphodiesterases Enzymes," John A. Lowe, III, et ai., Drugs of the<br>
Future 1992, 17(9):799-807 for a general review). Further clinical developments of<br>
roiipram and other first-generation PDE4 inhibitors were terminated due to the side effect<br>
profile of these compounds. The primary side effect in primates is emesis, while the<br>
primary side effects in rodents are testicular degranulation, weakening of vascular smooth<br>
muscle, psychotrophic effects, increased gastric acid secretion and stomach erosion.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to novel compounds, e.g., novel N-substituted<br>
aniline and diphenylamine compounds, that inhibit PDE4 enzymes, and especially have<br>
improved side effect profiles, e.g., are relatively non-emetic, (e.g., as compared to the<br>
previously discussed prior art compounds). Preferably, the compounds selectively inhibit<br>
PDE4 enzymes. The compounds of this invention at the same time facilitate entry into<br>
cells, especially cells of the nervous system.<br>
Still further, the present invention .provides methods for synthesizing compounds<br>
with such activity and selectivity as well as methods of (and corresponding<br>
pharmaceutical compositions for) treating a patient, e.g., mammals, including humans,<br>
requiring PDE inhibition, especially PDE4 inhibition, for a disease state that involves<br>
elevated in trace 11 ular PDE 4 levels or decreased cAMP levels, e.g., involving<br>
neurological syndromes, especially those states associated with memory impairment,<br>
most especially long term memory impairment, as where such memory impairment is due<br>
in pan to catabolism of intracellular cAMP levels by PDE 4 enzymes, or where such<br>
memory impairment may be improved by effectively inhibiting PDE4 enzyme activity.<br>
In a preferred aspect, the compounds of the invention improve such diseases by<br>
inhibiting PDE4 enzymes at doses which do not induce emesis.<br>

Appl. (1996),, 12pp. CODEN: PIXXD2' WO 9623754 A l " 19960808). Aniline<br>
intermediates 3 are produced in two steps; first, an addition reaction provides<br>
intermediate 2. followed by reduction of the nitro .group. Intermediate nitro compounds 2<br>
can be prepared by numerous published procedures, such as by Mitsunobu reactions or<br>
standard alkylanon reactions. Compounds where R2 is aryl or heteroaryi can be prepared<br>
by copper catalyzed reactions with aryl or heteroaryi iodides under Ullman conditions or<br>
by coupling aryl-, vinyl-, or heteroaryi- boroaic acids with phenol 2 in the presence of a<br>
copper catalyst (e.g.. Cu(OAc)2) and base such as TEA. Mitsunobu reaction between an<br>
appropriately substituted nitrophenol and a primary or secondary alcohol using an<br>
azodicarboxylate (e.g., DEAD, DLAD), and a suitable phosphine (e.g., PrnP, Bu3P)<br>
provides alkylated nitrophenols 2. Mitsunobu reactions are general performed in aprotic<br>
solvents such as dichloromethane or THF. Alternatively, alkylation can be achieved by<br>
. the reaction between an appropriately substituted nitrophenol and an alkyl halide in the<br>
presence of a.base (e.g.. K^CCh or NaH) in a polar aprotic solvent (e.g., DMF or<br>
CH3CN).-.<br>
Nitrocatechols 2 are subsequently reduced to the corre'sponding anilines 3 by<br>
methods standard in the art such, as by hydrogenation using a suitable catalyst (e.g., Pd on<br>
carbon) in a polar protic solvent (e.g., MeOH or EtOH) under an atmosphere of<br>
hydrogen. Alternatively, mtrocatechols 3 can be reduced by using a hydnde source (e.g.,<br>
NaBH4) and a transition metal catalyst (e.g., NiCl?, Pd on carbon) or by using metals<br>
(e.g., Zn, Sn, Fe) in mineral acid solutions (e.g.-, HC1) to produce the corresponding<br>
anilines. Generally polar protic solvents such as ethanol or methanol are used in these<br>
reactions.<br>
/Y-Arylalkyl-anilines 4 are synthesized by standard methods in the an such as by<br>
reductive animation reaction, alkylation reaction, or by reduction of corresponding<br>
amides. For example, the reductive animation reaction of an aryl or arylalkyl aldehyde<br>
with appropriately substimted anilines in the presence of a borohydnde reducing agent<br>
such as NaBtL or NaBHsCN with an acid catalyst such as acetic acid or pTsOK provides<br>
desrrea .V-aryialkylaniiines. These reactions generally take place in polar protic solvents<br>
such as methanol. ethanol, isopropanol. n-propanol and the like. -<br>
jV-Aryialkyianilines 4 rsadiiy undergo A'-arylation by methods standard TO the art<br>
including Ullman coupling reaction, metal-catalyzed coupling, or aromatic nucieophilic<br>
substitution reaction. For example, the metal catalyzed reaction between an Nbenzylaniline<br>
and an aryl halide using a palladium catalyst, (e.g., Pd^dba-j), a bulky<br>
electron rich phosphineligand (e.g., tributylphosphme), and suitable base (e.g., NaOtBu)<br>
provides Tv'-Arylalkyldipaenylamines. Nickel and copper catalysts have been employed<br>
as well. Solvents useful in this reaction include non-polar aprotic solvems.such as<br>
toluene, benzene, xylenes, tetrahydTofuran, and ether. When synthesizing compounds of<br>
the type 5 wherein R4 is an alkoxycarbonylphenyl, it is advantageous that amine 4 is<br>
coupled with 1,1 equivalents of tert-butyl 3-iodobenzene and that 22 mol % of (tBu)3P,<br>
5.5 mol % of Pd2(dba);, and 1.3 equivalents of tBuONa are used.<br>

Carboxylic ester intermediates 6 can be hydrolyzed under acidic or basic<br>
conditions to give the corresponding carboxylic acids 7. For example, an ethyl ester (R5<br>
= Et) can be hydrolyzed using a mixture of aqueous base (e.g., NaOH, KOH) and a water<br>
miscible solvent (e.g., EtOH, THF). While r-Butyl esters (R5* = i-butyl) can be<br>
hydrolyzed using an aqueous acid (e.g., HCI. formic acid. TFA) in a water miscible<br>
orEanic solvent, if necessarv.<br>

Coupling of protected tetrazole bromO'Or iodobenzenes (e.g., 5-(3-iodophenyl)-2-<br>
- /<br>
(2-tetrahydropyran)tetrazole) with. JV- substituted aniline derivatives 4 produce THP- .<br>
protected tetrazoles 8. Hydrolysis of THP -protected tetrazoles 8 can be accomplished by<br>
using an aqueous acid, such as HC1 in water and a miscible solvent such-as THF or EtOH<br>
to provide tetrazoles 9. Further, THP terrazoles 8 can also be oxidatively cleaved using<br>
reagents such as CAN and DDQ in halognenated hydrocarbon solvents such as<br>
dichioromethane, chloroform., dichloroethane and the like to yield tetrazoles 9.<br>
Alternatively; tetrazole analogs 9 can be prepared from the corresponding nitriles<br>
by treatment with aside ion (e.g., KN}, NaN~3, etc.) and a proton source (e.g., NELiCl) in a<br>
polar aprotic solvent such as DMF. They also may be prepared by treatment with an<br>
azide ion and a Lewis acid (e.g., ZnBr:) in. water, using a water miscible co-solvent such<br>
as isopropanol if necessary. Another method of preparation is by treatment of a nitrile<br>
with tin or silicon azides (e.g., Me3SiN3, Bu3SaNT3) in an aprotic organic solvent such as<br>
benzene, toluene, dichioromethane, dichloroethane, ether, THF, and the like.<br>

Diphenylamines 10 can be prepared by coupling appropriately substituted anilines<br>
3; such as 3-cyclopentyloxy-4-methoxyaniline, with arylboronic acids in the presence of<br>
a base such as tnethylamine and a copper catalyst such as copper acetate (as described by<br>
Chan et al, Tetrahedron Lett.. 39, 2933-2936 (1998)).- In general, halogenated solvents<br>
such as dichloromethane, chloroform, dichloroethane, and the like as well as norrpolar<br>
aprotic solvents such as benzene, toluene, or xylene are utilized. Such diphenylamines<br>
(e.g., 10) can more preferably be synthesized by metal catalyzed animation reactions.<br>
For example, reaction of an appropriately substituted aniline 3 with an arylhalide in the<br>
presence of a base (e.g., K^POo, CsCCh, orNaOtBu) and a palladium or nickel catalyst,<br>
for example Pd(dppf)Cb, a ligand (e.g., dppf) and a base (e.g., NaOtBu) (JACS. 1996,<br>
J18, 7217) or with Pdidba}, a bulky electron nch phosphine such as P(tBu)3; and a base<br>
(e.g., NaOtBu) (J. Org. Chem. 1999, 64, 5575) provides the desired diphenylamines 10.<br>
Solvents most commonly utilized in this type of reaction include non-polar aprotic<br>
solvents such as benzene, toluene, tetrahydrofuran, ether, and the like.<br>
Diphenylamines 10 can then be alkylated with various alkyl haiides or arylalkyl<br>
halides such as. but not limited to iodomethane, ethylbromide, benzylchloride, 3-<br>
(chloromethyljpyridine, 4-(chloromethyl)-2,6-dichloropyridine, and 4-(bromomethyl)-<br>
benzoic acid, or salts thereof, in the presence of a non-nucleophilic base such as sodium :<br>
hydnde, potassium hexamethyldisilazide or potassium diisopropylamide to provide Nsubstimted<br>
diphenylamines 5. Solvents useful in this reaction include aptotic solvents<br>
such as benzene, toluene, tetrahydrofuran, ether, DMF, and the like.<br>

Carboxylic acids 7 can be further manipulated to form carboxamides 11 using<br>
methods standard in the art. For example, a carboxylic-.acid can be treated with a suitable<br>
primary or secondary amine, in the presence of a suitable coupling reagent such as BOP.<br>
pyBOP or DCC, and a base such as Et^N or DIEA to yield a carboxamide. These<br>
reactions generally take place in non-polar aprotic solvents such as dichloromethane,<br>
chloroform, or dichloroethane.<br>
Carboxylic esters 6 or acids 7 can be reduced using methods standard in the an to<br>
give the corresponding carboxaldehyde or hydroxymethyl analogs. For example, an aryl<br>
ethyl ester (e.g., structure 6, R5 = ethyl) can be treated with an appropriate reducing agent<br>
(e.g., LAH, DIBAL, etc.)'in an aprotic solvent sueh as ether or TKF, ro produce the<br>
corresponding carboxaldehydes or hydroxymethyl analogs. Such aldehydes and alcohols<br>
can be further derivatised by methods standard in the art.<br>
Similarly carboxamides (e.g., structure 11) and nitriles can be reduced-using<br>
methods standard in the art to provide the corresponding substituted amines or<br>
aminomethy] analogs. For example,.an aryl carboxamide 11 can be reduced with an<br>
appropriate reducing agent (e.g., LAH) in an aprotic solvent (e.g.. benzene, toluene,<br>
ether, THF, etc.) to give the corresponding substituted aminomethyl analog. Whereas<br>
reduction of an aryl nitrite'yields the corresponding primary aminomethyl analog.<br>

Nitrobenzene compounds 12 can be reduced to the corresponding anilines 13 bymethods<br>
standard in the an such as hydrosenation using a suitable catalyst (e.g., Pd on<br>
carbon) in a polar protic solvent (e.g., EtOH, MeOH, etc.). Nitrobenzenes 12 can also be<br>
reduced using a hydnde source (e.g., NaBH
Pd on carbon) in polar protic solvents such as EtOH, to produce the corresponding<br>
anilines 13. These anilines can then befurther substituted by methods standard in the an.<br>
For example, anilines of the type 13 can be alkylated, acylated, or sulfonylated to give the<br>
corresponding N-alkyl amines, carboxamides (e.g., structure 15) or sulfonamides (e.g.,<br>
structure 14) respectively. For example, a sulfonamide can be prepared from an aniline<br>
and an appropriate sulfonyl halide or sulfonic anhydride (e.g./MeSO^CL EtSO^Cl,<br>
BnSO^Cl, PhSOiCl, etc.) in the presence of a base (e.g., Et/jN, pyndine, DIEA, etc.).<br>
Suitable solvents for .this reaction include non-polar aprotic solvents such as<br>
dichloromethane, chloroform, ether, and the like.<br>

Trialkylsilylethers of the type 16 are prepared as described in Scheme 1. The<br>
Jerr-butyldrmethylsilyl protected catechol intermediates 16 are readily deprotected by<br>
numerous literature methods (see Greene, T.W. and Wuts, P.G.M., Protective Groups in<br>
Organic Synthesis, 3rd Edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1999, pp. 273-276.) such as by using<br>
a fluoride ion source (e.g., BmNF) in an aprotic solvent such as ether or THF; or under<br>
acidic conditions (e.g., KF, 48% HBr, DMF). The resultant phenol 17, which is a very<br>
useful synthetic intermediate, can then be alkylated by methods standard in the art and in<br>
a similar manner as described for the alkylation of nitrophenol 2 in Scheme 1. For<br>
example, by the Mitsunobu reaction, by reaction with an alkyl halide in the presence of a<br>
base, or by Ullman type ary! coupling or by reaction with vinyl-, aryl- or heteroarylbororuc<br>
acids in the precence of a copper catalyst.<br>
SCHEME 8<br>

Haioalkoxy intermediates 18. prepared by aikylanon of the corresponding phenol<br>
can be aikylated by reactions with substituted amines, alcohols, or tbaois in the presence<br>
of a base to provide analogs such as 19. For example, an alkyl halide can be ammated<br>
with an appropriate primary or secondary amme and a base such as K^CCb, in a polar<br>
aprotic solvent such as THF, DMF, OT CH3CN.<br>
Many of these synthetic procedures are described more fully in the examples<br>
below.<br>
One of ordinary skill in the-art will recognize that some of the compounds of<br>
Formulae (I) and (T) can exist in different geometrical isomeric forms. In addition,<br>
some of the compounds of the present invention possess one or more asymmetric carbon<br>
atoms and are thus capable of existing in the form of optical isomers, as well as in the<br>
form of racemic or nonracemic mixtures thereof, and in the form of diastereorners and<br>
diastereomenc mixtures inter alia. All of these compounds, including cis isomers, trans<br>
isomers, diastereomic mixtures, racemates, nonracemic mixtures of enantiomers, and<br>
substantially pure and pure enantiomers, are within the scope of the present invention.<br>
Substantially pure enantiomers contain no more than 5% wAv of the corresponding<br>
opposite enannomer, preferably no more than 2%, most preferably no more than 1%.<br>
The optical isomers can be obtained by resolution of the racerruc mixtures<br>
according to conventional processes, for example, by the formation of diastereoisomenc<br>
salts using an optically active acid or-base or formation of covalent diastereorners.<br>
Examples of appropriate acids are tananc, diacetyltartaric, dibenzoyltanaric,<br>
ditoluoyltartanc and camphorsulfonic acid. Mixtures of diastereoisomers can be<br>
separated into their individual diastereorners on the basis of their physical and/or<br>
chemical differences by methods known to those skilled in the an, for example, by<br>
chromatography or fractional crystallization. The optically active bases or acids are then<br>
liberated from the separated diastereomenc salts. A different process for separation of<br>
optical isomers involves the use of chir-al chromatography (e.g., chiral FEPLC columns),<br>
_n<br>
with or without conventional derivation, optimally chosen to maximize the separation of<br>
the enannomers. Suitable chirai HPLC columns are manufactured by Diacel. e.g..<br>
Chiracel OD and Chiracei OJ among many others, all routinely selectable. Enzymatic<br>
separations, with or without derivitization. are also useful. Tne optically active<br>
compounds of Formulae I and F can likewise be obtained by crural syntheses utilizing<br>
optically active starting materials.<br>
The present invention also relates to useful forms of the compounds as disclosed<br>
herein, such as pharmaceutically acceptable salts and prodrugs of all the compounds of<br>
the present invention. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include those obtained by<br>
reacting the mam compound,, functioning as a base, with an inorganic or organic acid to<br>
farm, a salt, for example, salts of hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid,<br>
methane sulfonic acid^ camphor sulfonic acid, oxalic acid, maleic acid, succmic acid and<br>
citric acid. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts also include those in which the main<br>
compound functions as an acid and is reacted with an appropriate base to form, e.g..<br>
sodium; potassium, calcium, mangnesium, ammonium, and choline salts. Those skilled<br>
in the an will further recognize that acid addition salts of the claimed compounds may be<br>
prepared by reaction of the compounds with the appropriate inorganic or organic acid via<br>
any of a number of known methods. Alternatively, alkali and alkaline earth metal salts<br>
are prepared by reacting the compounds of the invention with the appropriate base via a<br>
vanety of known methods.<br>
The following are further examples of acid salts that can be obtained by reaction<br>
with inorganic or organic acids: acetates, adipates, alginates, citrates, aspartates,<br>
benzoates, benzenesulfonates, bisulfates, buryrates, camphorates, digluconates.<br>
cyclopentanepropionates, dodecylsulfai.es, ethanesulfonates, glucoheptanoates,<br>
giveerophosphates, hemisulfaies, heptanoates, hexanoates. fiimarates, hydrobromides,<br>
hydroiodides, 2-hydroxy-ethanesulfonates. lactates, maleates. methanesulfonates,<br>
nicotmaces. I-naphthalenesulfonates, oxaiates. paimoares, pectinates, persulfates, 3-<br>
phenylpropionates, picrates, pivalates, propionates. succinates, tanrates, thiocyanates,.<br>
tosylates, mesylates and undecanoates.<br>
Preferably, the salts formed are pharmaceutically acceptable for administration to<br>
mammals. Kovvever, pharmaceutically unacceptable salts of the compounds are suitable<br>
as intermediates, for example, for isolating the compound as a salt and then converting<br>
the salt back to the free base compound by treatment with an alkaline reagent. The free<br>
base can then, if desired, be converted to a.pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt.<br>
The compounds of the invention can be administered alone or as an active<br>
ingredient of a formulation. Thus, the present invention also includes pharmaceutical<br>
composftitms of compounds of Formulae I or I' containing, for example, one or more<br>
pharmaceutical!y acceptable earners.<br>
Numerous standard references are available that describe.procedures for prepanng<br>
various formulations suitable for administering the compounds according to the<br>
invention. Examples of potential formulations and preparations are contained, for<br>
example, in the Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients, American Pharmaceutical<br>
.Association (current edition); Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms: Tablets (Lieberman,<br>
Lachman and Schwartz, editors) current edition, published by Marcel Dekker, Inc., as<br>
well as Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (Arthur Osol, editor), 1553-1593 (current<br>
edition).<br>

invention can be administered to anyone requiring or desiring PDE4 inhibition, and/or<br>
enhancement of cognition. Administration may be accomplished according to patient<br>
needs, for example, orally, nasally, parenterally (subcutaneously, intraveneousiy, .<br>
intramuscularly, intrastemally and by infusion), by inhalation, rectally, vagmally.<br>
topically, locally, transaermally, and by ocular administration.<br>
Various solid oral dosage forms-can be used for administering compounds of the<br>
invention including such solid forms as tablets, gelcaps, capsules, capiets, granules. -<br>
lozenges and bulk powders. The- compounds of the present invention can be administered<br>

sucrose, mannitol. lactose, starches) and excipients known in the an, including but not<br>
limited to suspending agents, solubilizers. buffering agents, binders, disintegrants,<br>
preservatives, colorants, flavorants, lubncanis and the like. Time release capsules, tablets<br>
and gels are also advantageous in administering the compounds of the present invention.<br>
Various liquid oral dosage forms can also be used for administering compounds<br>
of the invention, including aqueous and non-aqueous solutions, emulsions, suspensions,<br>
syrups, and elixirs. Such dosage forms can also contain suitable inert diluents known in<br>
the art such as water and suitable excrpients known in the art such as preservatives,<br>
wetting agents, sweeteners, flavorants, as well as agents for emulsifying and/or<br>
Suspending the compounds of die invention. 'The compounds-of the present invention<br>
may be injected, for example, intravenously, in the form of an isotonic sterile solution.<br>
Other preparations are also possible.<br>
Suppositories for rectal administration of the compounds of the present invention<br>
can be prepared by mixing the compound with a suitable excipient such as cocoa butter,<br>
salicylates and polyethylene glycols. Formulations for vaginal administration can be in<br>
the form of a pessary, tampon, cream, gel, paste, foam, or spray formula containing, in<br>
addition to the active ingredient, such suitable carriers as are known in the art.<br>
For topical administration the pharmaceutical composition can be in the form of<br>
creams, ointments, liniments, lotions, emulsions, suspensions, geis, solutions, pastes,<br>
powders, sprays, and drops suitable for administration to the skin, eye, ear or nose.<br>
Topical administration may also involve transdermal administration via means such as<br>
rransdermal parches.<br>
Aerosol formulations suitable for administering via inhalation also can be made.<br>
For example, for treatment of disorders of the respiratory tract, the compounds according<br>
to the invenuon can be administered by inhalation in the form of a powder (e.g.,<br>
micromzed) or in the form of atomized solutions or suspensions, ine aerosol formulation<br>
can be placed into a pressurized acceptable propellant.<br>
The compounds can be administered as the sole active agent or in combination<br>
with other pharmaceutical agents such as other agents used in the treatment of cognitive<br>
impairment and/or in the treatment of psychosis, e.g.. other PDE4 inhibitors, calcium<br>
channel block ers, chlomergic drugs, adenosine receptor modulators, amphakmes NMD AR<br>
modulators, mGluR modulators, and cholmesterase inhibitors (e.g., donepezil,<br>
rivastigimine, and glanthanamme). In such combinations, each active ingredient can be<br>
administered either in accordance with their usual dosage range or a dose below its usual<br>
dosage range. ._? ^<br>
The present invention further includes methods of treatment that involve<br>
inhibition of PDE4 enzymes. Thus, the present invention includes methods of selective<br>
inhibition of PDE4 enzymes in animals, e.g., mammals, especially humans, wherein such<br>
inhibition has a therapeutic effect, such as where such inhibition may relieve conditions<br>
involving neurological syndromes, such as the loss of memory, especially long-term<br>
memory. Such methods compnse administering to an'1 animal in need thereof, especially<br>
a mammal, most especially a human, an inhibitory amount of a compound, alone or as<br>
part of a formulation, as disclosed herein.<br>
The condition of memory impairment is manifested by impairment of the ability<br>
to learn new information and/or the inability to recall previously learned information.<br>
Memory impairment is a primary symptom of dementia and can also be a symptom<br>
associated with such diseases as Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease,<br>
Huntmgton's disease. Pick's disease, Creutzfeld-Jakob disease, HIV', cardiovascular<br>
disease, and head trauma as well as age-related cognitive decline.<br>
Dementias are diseases thai include memory loss and'additional intellectual<br>
impairment separate from memory. The present invention includes methods for treating<br>
patients suffering from memory impairment in all forms of dementia. Dementias are<br>
classified according to their cause and include: neurodegeneraave dementias (e.g.,<br>
Alzheimer's. Parkinson's disease, Huntingtor/s disease. Pick's disease), vascular (e.g..<br>
mfarcts, hemorrhage, cardiac disorders), mixed vascular and Alzheimer's, bacterial<br>
meningitis, Creutzfeld-Jacob Disease, multiple sclerosis, traumatic (e.g., subcural<br>
/<br>
hematoma or traumatic brain injury), infectious (e.g., HIV), genetic (down syndrome),<br>
toxic (e.g., heavy metals, alcohol, some medications), metabolic (e.g.. vitamin B12 or<br>
folate deficiency), CNS hypoxia, Cushing's disease, psychiatric (e.g., depression and<br>
schizophrenia), and hydrocephalus.<br>
The present invention includes methods for dealing with memory loss separate<br>
from dementia, including mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and age-related cognitive<br>
decline. The present invention includes methods of rreatment for memory impairment as<br>
a result of disease. In another application, the invention includes methods for dealing<br>
with memory loss resulting from the use of general anesthetics, chemotherapy, radiation<br>
treatment, post-surgical trauma, and therapeutic intervention.<br>
The compounds may be used to treat psychiatric conditions including<br>
schizophrenia, bipolar or manic depression, major depression, and drug addiction and<br>
morphine dependence. These compounds may enhance wakefulness. PDE4 inhibitors<br>
can be used to raise cAMP levels and prevent neurons from undergoing apoptosis. PDE4<br>
inhibitors are also known to be anti-inflammatory. The combination of ami-apoptotic<br>
and anti-inflammatory properties make these compounds useful to treat<br>
neurodegeneration resulting from any disease or injury, including stroke, spinal cord<br>
injury" neurogenesis, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, amyiolateroscierosis (ALS),<br>
and multiple systems atrophy (MSA).<br>
Thus, m accordance with a preferred embodiment, the present invention includes<br>
methods of treating patients suffering from memory impairment due to, for example,<br>
Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, Huntmgron's disease. Pick's<br>
disease, Creutzfeld-Jakob disease, depression, aging, head trauma, stroke, CNS hypoxia, ,<br>
csrebral senility, multiinfarct dementia and other neurological conditions including acute<br>
neuronai ciseases, as .well as HIV' and cardiovascular diseases, comprising adininisierinj<br>
an effective amount of a compound according to Formula (I) or (T) or pharmaceuhcally<br>
accepiabie sails thereof. The compounds of the present invention can also be used in a method of treating<br>
patients suffering from disease states characterized by decreased NMD A function, such<br>
as schizophrenia. The compounds can also be used to treat psychosis characterized by<br>
elevated levels of PDE 4. for example, various forms-of depression, such as manic<br>
depression, major depression, and depression associated with psychiatric and<br>
neurological disorders- , -<br>
As mentioned; the compounds of the invention also exhibit anti-inflammatory<br>
• activity. As a,result, the inventive compounds are useful in the treatment of a 'variety of<br>
allergic and inflammatory diseases, particularly disease states characterized by decreased<br>
cyclic AMP levels and/or elevated phosphodiesterase 4 levels. Thus, in accordance with<br>
a further embodiment of the invention, there is provided a method of treating allergic and<br>
inflammatory disease states, comprising administering an effective amount of a<br>
compound according to Formulae (I) or (I1) or a pharrhaceuticaily acceptable salt thereof.<br>

In Vitro Measurement of Type 4 Phosphodiesterase Inhibition Activity<br>
Human PD-E4 was obtained from baculovirus-infected Sf9 celis that expressed the<br>
'recombinant enzyme. The c'DNA encoding hPDE-4D6 was subcloned into, a baculoviras<br>
vector. Insect cells '(Sf9)' were infected with the baculovirus and cells were cultured until<br>
protein was expressed. The baculovirus-infected cells were lysed and the iysate was used<br>
as source of hPDE-4D6 enzyme. The enzyme was partially purified using a DEAJE ion<br>
exchange chromatography. This procedure can be repeated using cDNA encoding other<br>
PDE-4 enzymes.<br>
Assay:<br>
Type 4 phosphodiesterases convert cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) to<br>
5'-adenosine monophosphate (5'-AM?). Nucleotidase converts 5'-AMP to adenosine.<br>
Therefore the combined activity of PDE4 and nucleotidase converts cAMP to adenosine.<br>
Adenosine is readily separated from cAMP by neutral alumina columns.<br>
Phosphodiesterase inhibitors block the conversion of cAMP to adenosine in this assay;<br>
consequently. PDE4 inhibitors cause a decrease in adenosine.<br>
Cell lysates (40 ul) expressing hPDE-4D6 were combined with 50 ui of assay mix<br>
and 10 ul of inhibitors and incubated for 12 min at room temperature. Final<br>
concentrations of assay components were: 0. 4 ug enzyme, lOrruVl Tris-HCl (pH 7.5),<br>
lOmM MgCk 3 uM cAMP, 0.002 U 5r-nucieoridase, and 3 x 1C4 cpm of [3H]cAMP.<br>
. The reaction was stopped by adding 100 ul of boiling 5mN KC1. An aliquot of 75 ul of<br>
reaction mixture was iransferred from each well to alumina columns (Muitiplate;<br>
Millipore). Labeled adenosine was eluted into an OpdPlate by spinning at 2000 rprn for<br>
2 mm; 150 ul per well of scintillation fluid was added to the OptiPlate. The plate was<br>
sealed, shaken for about 30 min, and cpm of [JH]adenosine was determined-using a<br>
WalJac Influx®.<br>
All test compounds are dissolved in 100% DMSO and diluted into the assay such<br>
that the final concentration of DMSO is'0.1%. DMSO does not affect enzyme activity at<br>
this concentration.<br>
A decrease in adenosine concentration is indicative of inhibition of PDE activity..<br>
pICso values were determined by screening 6 to 12 concentrations of compound ranging<br>
from 0.1 nM to 10,000 nM and then plotting drug concentration versus 3H-adenosine<br>
concentration. Nonlinear regression software (Assay Explorer®) was used to estimate<br>
pICso values,<br>

. Passive Avoidance in Rats, an in vivo Test for Learning and Memory<br>
The test was performed as previously described (Zhang, H.-T., Cnssman, A.M.,<br>
Dorairaj, N.R., Chandler, L.J., and O'Donnell, J.M., Neuropsychopharmacology., 2000,<br>
23, 198-204.). The apparatus (Model E10-16SC, Coulboum Instruments, Alien town, PA)<br>
consisted of a two-compartment chamber with an illuminated compartment connected to<br>
a darkened compartment by a guillotine door. The floor of the darkened compartment<br>
consisted of stainless steel rods through which an electric foot-shock could be delivered<br>
from a constant current source. All experimental groups were first habituated to the<br>
apparatus the day before the start of the experiment. During the training, the rat (Male<br>
Spraque-Dawley (Harlan) weighing 250 to 350 g) was placed in the illuminated<br>
compartment facing away from the closed guillotine door for 1 minute before the door .<br>
was raised. The latency for entering the darkened compartment was recorded. After the<br>
rat entered the darkened compartment the door was closed and a 0.5 rnA electric shock<br>
was administered for 3 seconds. Twenty-four hours later, the rat was administered O.I<br>
mg/kg MK-801 or saline, 30 minutes prior to the injection of saline or test compound<br>
(dosed from 0.1 to 2.5 mg/kg, i.p.), which was 30 minutes before the retention test<br>
started. The rat was again placed in the illuminated compartment with the guillotine door<br>
open. The latency for entering the darkened compartment was recorded for up to 180<br>
seconds, at which time the trial was terminated.<br>
All data were analyzed by analyses of variance (ANOVA); individual<br>
comparisons were made using Kewman-Keuls tests. Naive rats required less than 30<br>
•secondsj on average, to cross from the illuminated compartment co the darkened<br>
compartment. However, 24 hours after the electric shock exposure, most rats pretreated<br>
with vehicle did not re-enter the darkened compartment; the average latency was<br>
increased up to 175 seconds (p 
markedly reduced this latency when compared to the vehicle (p

Radial arm maze task in Rats, an in vivo Test for Learning and Memory<br>
The test was performed as previously described (Zhang, H.-T., Cnssman, A.M.,<br>
Dorairaj. N.R., Chandler,. L.J., and O'Donnell, J.M., Neuropsychopharmacoiogy, 2000,<br>
23, 198-204.). Five days after initial housing, rats (rnaJe Spraque-Dawley (Earlan)<br>
weighing 250 to 350 §) were placed in the eight-arm radial maze (each arm was<br>
60x10x12 cm high; me maze was elevated 70 cm above the floor) for acclimation for TWO<br>
days. Rats were then placed individually m the center of the maze for 5 minutes with<br>
food pellets placed close to the food wells, and then, the next day, in the wells at the end<br>
of the arms; 2 sessions a day were conducted. Next, four randomly selected arms were<br>
then baited with one pellet of food each. The rat was restricted to the center platform (26<br>
cm in diameter) for 15 seconds and then allowed to move freely throughout the maze<br>
until it collected all pellets of food or 10 minutes passed, whichever came first. Four<br>
parameters were recorded: 1) working memory- errors, i.e., entries into baited arms that<br>
had already been visited during the same trial; 2) reference memory errors, i.e., entries<br>
into unbaited arms; 3) total arm entries; and 4) the test duration (seconds), i.e., the time<br>
spent in the collection of all the pellets in the maze. If the working memory error was<br>
zero and the average reference/memory error was less than one in five successive trials,<br>
'the rats began the drug tests. MK-801 or saline was injected 15 minutes prior to vehicle<br>
or test agent, which was given 45 minutes before the test. Experiments were performed<br>
in a lighted room, which contained several extra-maze visual cues.<br>
All data were analyzed by analyses of variance (ANOVA); individual<br>
corriparisons were made using Kewman-Keuls tests. Compared to control, MK-801 (0.1<br>
