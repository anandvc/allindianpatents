The present invention relates to a mixing element for use in a static type motionless fluid mixer having not a mechanically movable portion, for mixing one and more kinds of fluids (liquid, gas, and powder and particle substance), and relates to a method of producing the same. Description of the relevant Art<br>
The static type fluid mixer of this kind is used as, for example, a treatment apparatus by a gas absorption reaction of a harmful material such as HCl, CI2, NO, SO and the like in a waste gas, an organo-chloric compound removing apparatus by an aeration treatment of a waste water including an orgapo-chloric compound such as<br>
trichloroethane, methylene chloride, trihalomethane and the like in the waste water, otherwise a dust removing (dust collecting) apparatus of SiOj dust and the like exhausted from a semiconductor factory and an optical fiber producing factory.  Also, the static type fluid mixer is used in many tields such as the chemical industry, the paper and pulp industry, the food industry, the fermentation industry, the civil engineering and construction industry, the plastic industry and the pollution prevention industry and the like. This static type fluid mixer is constituted by disposing in a pipe a plurality of blades connected to each other, each of the "blades being twisted spirally.  During two and<br><br>
more kinds of fluids which are different in characteristic from each other flow in the fluid mixer, the fluid advances spirally through passages partitioned by the blades, and is divided at boarders of respective blades, and further is joined to the divided fluids passing through the other passages (for example, U.S. Patent No. 4,408,893).  And, the fluid is agitated and mixed by a repeat of the division and the joining.<br>
The fluid includes a liquid, a gas or a powder and particle substance, and, as different characteristics of the fluid, there are a viscosity, a composition, a temperature, a color, and a particle size.  This fluid mixer can mix the fluids which are different in phase, such as a mixing of a gas and a liquid.<br>
Such a fluid mixer- is used as means for a mixing, an agitating, a dispersion, an emulsification, an extraction, a heat exchanging, a reaction, a gas absorption and a dilution and the like, in the above mentioned fields.<br>
Moreover, as a method of producing the fluid mixer, there is a method of inserting spiral blades of a right-handed twisting or a left-handed twisting in a pipe, and fixing adjacenr blades to each other by welding and brazing and the like (Japanese Patent Publication (KOKOKU) 44-8290).  And, there is a technique of inserting spiral blades of a right-handed twisting or a left-handed twisting in a pipe, and engaging or fitting adjacent blades with each other- to disposing them in a pipe (West Germany Laid Open No." 2262016).  Further, there is a method of inserting<br><br>
spiral blades of a right-handed twisting or a left-handed twisting in a pipe while disposing supporting pieces between the adjacent blades, thereby fixing and connecting the blades by the supporting pieces (U.S. Patent No. 3,953,002). Furthermore, there is a method of inserting baffle plates twisted on the right-handed side or on the left-handed side into a tubular housing, and engaging with each other concave grooves formed on protrusions of both ends of the baffle plate to thereby connect them (Japanese Patent Publication (KOKOKU) No.1-31928).  Furthermore, there is proposed a fluid mixer in which baffle plates are formed by arranging narrow portions of band-like members at predetermined pitches, twisting wide portions of the band-like members spirally and in a clockwise direction or an anti-clockwise direction, and twisting the narrow portions by about 90o, and then the baffle plates are inserted into a pipe (U.S. Patent No. 4,408,893).<br>
However, the above mentioned respective fluid mixer all have  drawback in which the producing thereof is not easy.<br>
Particularly, there are drawbacks in which the connecting portions of the blades is weak in mechanical strength in a case where the blades are welded or biaded ro each other (Japanese Patent Publication (KOKOKU) No. 44-8290), and the welding portions are broken or snapped in a case where the twisting stress is added thereto.<br>
Also, there is a drawback in which the connection portion of the baffle plates is weak in twisting stress and easy to be broken in a case where the baffle plates are<br><br>
spot-connected to each other at center portions thereof (U.S. Patent No.4,408, 893).<br>
And, this fluid mixer has a drawback in which the mixing effect in a laminar flow region of a high viscosity fluid.<br>
Further, as described above, each of the conventional fluid mixers has the drawbacks in which the producing cost is expensive due to the difficulty of producing thereof and the mixing effect is low.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a mixing element in which the strength of joint portions of respective blade bodies is large, and the fluid mixing effect is excellent and the producing cost is cheap, and to provide a method of producing the mixing element in hiah efficiency.<br>
A mixing element according to the present invention comprises a cylindrical passage pipe through which a liquid flows, and spiral blade bodies disposed inside the passage pipe so as to form an opening portion in central portion of the passage pipe.  The spiral blade forms inside the passage pipe a plurality of fluid passages.  It is characterized in that a plurality of the fluid passages are communicated to each other through said opening portions.<br>
A method of producing a mixing element according to the present invention is characterized in that the method comprises a step of joining a plurality of spiral blade bodies to an inside of a cylindrical passage pipe, the blade bodies each being produced independently to the passage<br><br>
pipe.<br>
Further, a method of producing a mixing element according to the present invention comprises steps of joining a plurality of spiral blade bodies to an inside of a cylindrical passage pipe to form a plurality of fluid passages.  Each of the spiral blade bodies is produced independently to the passage pipe, and joins to the passage pipe.<br>
In the conventional mixing element, a cylindrical passage pipe and spiral blade bodies are unitedly formed. On the contrary, in the mixing element according to the present invention, a cylindrical passage pipe and  spiral blade bodies are independently formed, respectively. Accordingly, the number of the blade bodies which improve the mixing efficiency can be increased easily.  Also, the producing of the fluid mixer having a large diameter becomes easy, and the producing cost becomes cheap.<br>
On the other hand, in the method of producing the mixing element according to the present invention, a cylindrical passage pipe and spiral blade bodies are independently formed, respectively.  Since the spiral blade bodies are joined to an inside of the cylindriccil passage pipe by means of a welding, an adhering, a depositing, and a locking and the like, the mixing element are produced easily.<br>
And, in the method of producing the mixing element in which a number of spiral blade bodies contributing to an improvement of the mixing efficiency are joined to an inside of a cylindrical passage pipe, the cylindrical passage pipe<br><br>
is divided into a plural over whole longitudinal length, a plurality of blade bodies are joined to an inside of the divided passage pipe, after that, and the divided faces of the passage pipes are joined to each other, thereby the mixing element having a high mixing efficiency is produced easily.<br>
The static type fluid mixer is accomplished by arranging thus produced plural mixing elements are disposed in the pipe, or by joining the mixing elements with each other. According to the present invention, the fluid mixer having an extremely high mixing efficiency can be produced easily and at a low cost.  And, the fluid mixer having a large diameter can be produced at a low cost.<br>
According to the present invention, the running cost of the apparatus is low,, and the mixer having a high efficiency can be produced easily, and the price of the apparatus is cheap, since there becomes useless a driving power means for supplying one and more kinds of fluids of a liquid, a gas, a powder and particle substance and the like into the static fluid mixer including the mixing element, to mix and agitate the fluids.  Also, since the power source becomes useless, the large scale apparatus becomes useless, and the installing area of the apparatus is enough to be narrow. Further, since the mixing and agitating efficiency and the absorbing efficiency is high, the mixing time and the treating time can be shortened.  Furthermore, since the trouble such as the blinding due to the dust , and the like is eliminated, a long time continuous running of the<br><br>
apparatus can be realized.<br>
Also, the blade bodies are produced individually, the mixer having a large diameter can be produced extremely easily and at a low cost. Further, this mixer can be used widely as means for a mixing, and agitating, a dispersion, an emulsification, an extraction, a heat exchanging, a reaction, a gas absorption, a dust collecting, a distillation, a rectification, an adsorption, a biochemical reacter and the like.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a mixing element for static t&gt;pe motionless fluid mixer, comprising a cylindrical passage pipe through which a liquid flows; and a plurality of blade bodies disposed inside the passage pipe, the blade bodies forming inside the passage pipe a plurality of fluid passages extending spirally and in a longitudinal direction of the passage pipe, and a gap between the blade bodies forming an opening for communicating the fluid passages with each other.<br>
Further, the invention also relates to a method of manufacturing a mixing element as herein above described, said method comprising the steps of joining a plurality of blade bodies which are independently formed to an inner wall of a cylindrical passage pipe; to form a plurality of fluid passages, an opening between the blade bodies communicating with the fluid passages partitioned by the blade bodies.<br>

spirally by 90° or 180°, one portion of the rotated fluid is sheared at the opening portion, and the one portion of the fluid is joined with the fluid flowing through the other passage, and then after the division, they are rotated spirally by 90° or 180° reversely.  During such a rotation, a shearing, a joining, a division, and a shift are repeated, the fluids are mixed.<br>
Next, an embodiment to which the mixing element according to the present invention is applied will be described.<br>
Fig. 8 is a block diagram showing an embodiment of the mixing element according to the present invention applied to a treatment apparatus of a waste gas including a harmful gas of HCl, CI2, F, NH3, H2S and the like, and a dust of SiO^, ZnO and the like.  The waste gas is supplied into the waste gas treatment apparatus 35 to which the static type fluid mixer 30 including the mixing element according to the embodiment of the present invention is applied, and then a substance of HCl, CI2   and the like in the waste gas is transferred from a gas phase to a liquid phase due to a mixing-catalysis between the gas and the liquid.  The waste gas treatment apparatus 35 is cnnneci^ed with a tank 36 disposed therebelow, and the tank 36 is connected to a gas-liquid separating apparatus 37 such as a demister, a cyclone or a packed tower and the like.  The gas and the liquid are separated at the gas-liquid separating apparatus, and the liquid is returned to the tank 36.  A discharged gas from the gas-liquid separating apparatus 37 is released to<br><br>
the atmosphere through an exhauster 38.  A water solution in the tank 3 6 is discharged to a waste water treatment process and the like by opening a valve 39 suitably, and a new liquid is supplied into the tank 36 suitably.  The treatment apparatus 35 is provided with a spray nozzle 40 at a head portion thereof, and the nozzle 40 is supplied with the liquid in the tank 36 through a pump 41.  Accordingly, the liquid is injected into the treatment apparatus 35 through the nozzle 40, and is collected in the tank 36, and then is supplied to the nozzle 40 through the pump 41, thereby the liquid is circulated to be used.  As for this liquid, a water or an acid or alkaline water and the like is selectively used according to the substance in the waste gas.<br>
Next, a construction of the treatment apDaratus 35 will be explained. The treatment apparatus 35 is, as shown in Figs. 1 and 2, provided with the static type fluid mixer 30 including the mixing element 1, 8 constituted by arranging a plurality of the spiral blade bodies of a right-handed twist and a left-handed twist at a predetermined position of the mixing element.  In thus constructed waste gas treatment apparatus 3b, the waste gas including HCl, Clj, SiOj and the like is supplied into the treatment apparatus 35 from an upper portion of the treatment apparatus 35.  And, the water solution pumped from the tank 35 by the pump 41 is injected into the treatment apparatus 35 through the spray nozzle 40 disposed on the head portion of the treatment apparatus 35. The waste gas and the water solution are rotated spirally in<br><br>
the right-handed direction and in the left-handed direction during they flow in parallel-flow in the treatment apparatus 35.  The waste gas and the water solution are subjected to a mixing-catalysis in gas and liquid in high efficiency while such a division, a joining, a shift and a shearing function are repeated.  Thereby, the substances of HCl, CI2 and the like in the waste gas is dissolved and absorbed in the water solution due to the chemical reaction in association with the liquid.  And, micro particles of Si02 and the like are caught and collected in the water solution.  The absorbed and caught substances are collected together with the water solution in the tank 36 disposed below.  The waste gas is fed to the gas-liquid separating apparatus 37, and a spray of a small diameter existing in a flow of the gas is separated into the gas and the liquid by the gas-liquid separating apparatus ,37, and then the liquid is returned to the tank 36.  Moreover, a spray nozzle (not shown) is disposed on a head portion or a lower portion of the gas-liquid separating apparatus 37 and the water solution is injected into the apparatus 37 through the nozzle, so that a collecting efficiency of the contained substances is increased furrher more, and tne maintenance service becomes easy.  The water solution in the tank 36 is circulated to be used by the pump 41.  If the water solution in the tank 36 includes particles of Si02 and hydrochloric acid and the like to become high in concentration thereof, the water solution in the tank 36 is discharged to the waste water treatment process and the like by opening the valve 39<br><br>
suitably, and also a new liquid is supplied to the tank 36 suitably.  A clean waste gas which is removed with substances of HCl, SiOj and the like is released to the atmosphere through the exhauster 38.<br>
Moreover, a plurality of spray nozzles may be disposed in the treatment apparatus 35 in the longitudinal direction. In this case, a space portion may be disposed between the adjacent mixing elements, and one or more spray nozzles may be disposed in the space portion.  And, the mixing element 34 having a space portion 33 may be used, and the spray nozzles may be disposed in the space portion 33.  These spray nozzles prevents the dust and the reaction product from adhering to an inside of the mixing nozzle and ensures a long and continuous operation, and then decreases a pressure loss inside the apn?<t-atus further these spray nozzles have effects that a gas-liquid catalysis is raised to improve the removing efficiency and gas absorbing furthermore new liquid supplied also.></t-atus>
Incidentally, operating conditions of a ratio between a treated amount of the gas and a circulated amount of the liquid, and a time of a mixing and contacting, etc. are selected suitably according to the kind, concentration, physical properties, etc. of the treatment gas.<br>
Next, Fig. 9 is a block diagram showing an embodiment of the mixing element according to the present invention applied to a wet type treatment apparatus of a waste gas including a harmful gas such as NO^^, SO^ and the like discharged from a burning furnace, an incinerator and a<br><br>
dissolving apparatus and the like.  The waste gas is supplied into the waste gas treatment apparatus 43 from a lower portion thereof, which apparatus 43 is provided with a static type liquid mixer 42 formed by the mixing element according to the embodiment of the present invention, and NOj,, SO^ and the like in the waste gas is subjected to a gas absorption or gas dilution reaction due to a<br>
mixing-catalysis between the gas and the liquid, so that the harmful substance is absorbed in the water solution.  The waste gas treatment apparatus 43 is connected with a tank 44 disposed therebelow.  A purified discharge gas from the waste gas treatment apparatus 43 is released to the atmosphere through a gas-liquid separating apparatus 45 and an exhauster 46.  The water solution is discharged to the waste water treatment process and the like by opening a valve 47 suitably, and a new liquid is supplied to the tank 44 suitably.

solution which are different in solid concentration of three<br>
stages of high, middle and low, so that re-scattering of the<br>
dust due to an accompanying of the spray is prevented, then<br>

axi-duyeu in the vertical direction, an arrangement area is<br>
lessened.	;<br>

The method ot the mixing element 1, 8 is realized by joining spiral blade bodies 3, '4  and 10, 11 to an inside of a cylindrical passage pipe 2 and 9, while the spiral blade bodies 3, 4 and 10, 11 is produced independently to the passage pipe 2 and 9.<br>
Also, the mixing elem.ent 96 may be produced by joining a plurality of spiral blade bodies 93, 94 to an fnside of<br><br>
cylindrical passage pipes 92a, 92b divided into a plural, while the spiral blade bodies 93, 94 is produced independently to the passage pipe 92a and 92b, and the divided faces 95a, 95b of the divided passage pipes 92a, 92b are joined to each other.  Thereby, the mixing element having a number of blade bodies is produced easily.<br>
Next, one embodiment of a method of producing the blade body will be explained with reference to the accompanied drawings.  Fig. 21 is a side view of a spiral blade body 97 of a 180° right-handed rotation type for use in the mixing element (Refer to Fig. 4) according to the present invention. Fig. 22 is a schematic development view of a material of a semi-circle member 98 having the same, area as the blade body 97, and Fig. 23 is a schematic explanatory view.of a molding die 100 for molding the semi-circular member 98.<br>
The molding die 100 has an upper die 101 and a lower die 102.  The upper die 101 has a base 103, and a spiral member 104 supported on the base 103 through a plurality of supporting bodies 105.  Similarly, the lower die 102 has a base 105, a plurality of supporting bodies 107 and a spiral member 108.  Also, the spiral members 104 and 108 have contacting faces forming the spiral face substantially same as the desired blade body, and has a desired width and a predetermined rotation angle (twisting angle). Incidentally, the rotation angle of the spiral member 104 and 108 is 360° .<br>
A semi-circle membeif 98 is identical in area with the<br><br>
blade body 97, and has a semi-circle hole 99 having a diameter substantially same as a diameter of the opening portion of the mixing element.  A spiral blade body 97 of a 180o right-handed rotation type is produced by placing the semi-circle member 98 on a spiral face of the spiral member 108 of a right-handed rotation type on the lower die 102, descending the upper die 101, and interpose-pressing and molding the semi-circle member 98 by the spiral members 104 and 108.<br>
Moreover, in a case where the interpose-pressing and molding is carried out, an inner circumferential edge portion 109 or an outer circumferential edge portion 110 of the spiral member 108 may be provided with protrusions (not shown) to prevent an eccentricity of the semi-circle member 98 at the time of interpose-pressing and molding.  Thereby, the exact spiral blade body without eccentricity is produced easily.<br>
Furthermore, the above mentioned embodiment is described with respect to the method of producing the spiral blade body of a 180° right-handed rotation type.  However, in case of the spiral blade body of a 180° left-handed rotation "^YPS, it is produced similarly Lu Llie above mentioned method by using a spiral member of a left-handed rotation type instead of the spiral blade body of a right-handed rotation type if the upper die 101 and the lower die 102.<br>
Also, in a case where the blade body of 90° rotation type is produced, the spiral body of a 180° rotation type may be cut into two bodies at a position of 90° rotation<br><br>
angle thereof to form a blade body of 90° rotation type. Or, the blade body of 90° rotation type may be produced similarly to the method mentioned above by<br>
interpose-pressing and molding a plate like member developed in a plane similarly to the semi-circular member 98. Further, in case of the spiral blade body of a 360° rotation type, it is produced by the similar method mentioned above.<br>
Also, a perforated blade body is produced by forming a plate having a plurality of circle like holes or slit perforated in a thicknesswise direction of the plate in a spiral.  And, in a case where the porous blade body is produced, it is enough to be formed by using a support in which a metal or a ceramic and the like is coated on urethane form of three dimensional mesh like construction or three dimensional mesh like molding body of urethane form and the like, or a material in which the support is sintered, and the like.<br>
Further, the method of the blade body disposed in the mixing element according to the present invention is not limited to the above mentioned embodiments, for which other methods can be selected suitably according to a construction material.  That xs, the otner methods are an injection molding method, an extrusion molding, a press molding method, a casting method, a forging method, a lost wax method, a spinning-winding working method, a mud cast-in method and the like.  Incidentally, as the construction material, there can be selected to be used suitably one kind of a metal, a plastic, a ceramic, a glass and the like, or a<br><br>
composite material thereof, according to the use.  Also, the producing method and the construction material are selected to be used suitably for the passage pipe similarly to the blade body.<br>
Next,  Fig. 24 is a partially enlarged explanatory view of a producing processes of a 90° right-handed rotation type mixing element.  There will be explained in detail with reference to Fig, 24 a method of producing the mixing element according to the present invention comprising a step of joining a cylindrical passage pipe having a desired diameter and a desired length and a blade body produced independently to the passage pipe.<br>
Similarly to the mixing element (Refer to Fig. 1) mentioned above, the mixing element 111 has a spiral blade body 113 of a 90" right-handed rotation type inside a cylindrical passage pipe 112.  The blade body 113 is-joined to the passage pipe 112 at a joining portion 114 by means of a welding, an adhering, a depositing, or a locking and the like.  The mixing element 111 is produced by joining a desired number of the blade bodies 113 on an inside of the passage pipe 112 at a predetermined positions in order according to the similar joining method mentioned above.<br>
The mixing element is produced easily according to the producing method mentioned above.  Also, the mixing element having a large diameter can be produced easily and at a low cost.  Further, there can be produced easily the mixing element provided with a plurality of the blade bodies contributing an improvement of the mixing efficiency inside<br><br>
of the cylindrical passage pipe (Refer to Fig. 25).  In this case, the mixing element 115 can be produced easily and at a low cost further more by using a plurality of the divided passage pipe over the whole longitudinal length of the passage pipe.<br>
Next, Fig. 26 is an explanatory view of an embodiment of the mixing element according to the present invention applied to a wet type exhaust gas desulfurizer.  The waste gas including sulfur oxides, especially sulfur dioxides (SO2) exhausted from a boiler (not shown) is introduced to a desulfurizing tower main body 201 from an inlet duct 202, and exhausted from an outlet duct 205 through a mist separator 203 and an exhauster 204.  An absorbing liquid including calcium carbonate transferred from an absorbing liquid pump 206 is sprayed through a plurality of spray nozzles 207 into the desulfurizing tower (absorbing tower) 201 provided therein with a mixing element 200 according to the present invention, and then a gas-liquid<br>
mixing-catalysis between the absorbing liquid and the waste gas is performed.  At this occasion, the absorbing liquid absorbs SO^ in the waste gas selectively thereby calcium sulfite is produced according to the following reaction equat<br>
SO2 + H2O = H* + HSO3"     (1)<br>
HSO3- = H* + SO3"	(2)<br>
CaCOa = Ca"* + CO3	(3)<br>
Ca** + SO3- = CaSOj	(4)<br>
CaS03 + 1/2 H2O = CaS03-(l/2)H20    (5)<br><br>
The absorbing liquid producing calcium sulfite is collected in an oxidation tank 208, and then is agitated by a static type mixer 209, during which calcium sulfite in the absorbing liquid is oxidized by an air supplied from an air blowing apparatus (not shown), thereby plaster is produced.<br>
The reaction in the oxidation tank 208 is in the following.<br>
HSO3" + I/2O2 -» SO4" + H*       (6)<br>
Ca" + SO4" - CaSO^	(7)<br>
CaSOa + 2H2O -* CaS04-2H20       (8)<br>
One portion of the absorbing liquid in the oxidation tank 208 in which calcium carbonate and plaster coexist is transferred to the spray nozzles 207 again through the absorbing liquid pump 206, and the other portion is transferred to a waste liquid^^reatina and plaster collecting system (not shown) through an absorbing liquid extracting pipe 210.  Also, one portion of the absorbing liquid sprayed and atomized from the spray nozzles 207 is accompanied with the waste gas, however, it is collected by the mist separator 203 connected to the oxidation tank 208.<br>
The higher the PH is, the more an absorption rate of SO2 is improved.  However, absorbing liquid drops sprayed from the spray nozzles 207 are rapid in diffusion therein, so that PH of a surface of the liquid drop is decreased when calcium sulfite is produced on the surface of the liquid drop due to the reaction to SOj.  Therefore, the reactivity to SO2 in the absorbing drop is lowered abruptly.  In the end, the absorbing liquid reacts with SO2 immediately when<br><br>
it is sprayed, however, goes down to the oxidation tank 208 almost without absorbing SOj when PH of the surface of the liquid drop is decreased once.<br>
Accordingly, the absorbing liquid drops turn out to have an absorbing efficiency if PH can be recovered before the absorbing liquid drops reaches to the oxidation tank 208, so that the reaction to SOj is accelerated to improve the absorption rate.<br>
As a method of recovering PH of the absorbing liquid drops which has been decreased once, there is a method of oxidizing calcium sulfite exist on  the surface of the absorbing liquid drops.<br>
Fig. 27 is an explanatory view showing an variant embodiment of the oxidation tank 208 for oxidizing the absorbing liquid and calcium sulfite.  The absorbing liquid is transferred to the mixer 209 by the pump 206, and the absorbing liquid and the air are mixed in the mixer 209 to be returned to the oxidation tank 208.<br>
Moreover, two of the requirements for the construction of the desulfurizing tower (absorbing tower) are in the following.<br>
— I       ■	 —	1	3— — —	^.iv— ^ a—" -^-^^„-..— ww.i v,w.w w-^..y<br>
efficiency are varied if a drift current of the waste gas in the desulfurizing tower is generated, a bad influence is exerted to the desulfurizing performance. 2)  To prevent an adhering of a crystal product such as calcium sulfite, calcium sulfate and the like.<br>
In a case where the static type^mixer according to the<br><br>
present invention is used for the absorbing tower of the wet type exhaust gas desulfurizer, a dissolving of SO2 and an oxidation reaction of the reaction product (reaction intermediate) are accelerated, further a gas-liquid interface of the absorbing liquid and the gas, and surfaces of the absorbing liquid drops are renewed to contribute an acceleration of a gas absorbing reaction.  Also, a slurry-liquid (absorbing liquid) is circulated to be used always in an agitating state.  Furthermore, the spray nozzles provided in the absorbing tower prevents an adhering and a growth of the reaction product and the slurry and the like to the blade body, and increases the gas-liquid contacting to improve the absorbing efficiency, and further, contributes a lowering of the pressure loss in the tower.  Further, the spray nozzle has a function of supplying the new fresh absorption liquid.<br>
Incidentally, as the absorbing liquid, there can be used one and more kinds of soda compounds, magnesium compounds, calcium compounds, ammonia compounds, aluminum compounds, organic bases (example: aromatic amines), aqueous acids and molten salts.<br>
Next, ail  euibodliiient in which the mixing element according to the present invention is applied to the wet type exhaust gas desulfurizer with reference to Fig. 28.<br>
The waste gas is blown into the liquid below the surface thereof by 50-500 mm through an inlet plenum 221 and one or more static type fluid mixers 222 extending to under the liquid surface therefrom.  A high efficient gas-liquid<br><br>
mixing-catalysis is made in the static type fluid mixer 222, thereby SO2 is absorbed.  The desulfurized and purified gas is exhausted to an outside through the gas exhaust pipe 223.<br>
SO2 absorbed in the mixer 222 is oxidized into sulphate ion immediately thereat.  The absorbing liquid is moved to a lower portion of the apparatus after bubbles are removed, into which lime stone slurry is poured in order to supply calcium ion.  Then, the absorbing liquid is moved to oxygen dissolving regions 224.  On this region, the absorbing liquid dissolving oxygen is moved to a mixer layer to act as a medium of absorbing and oxidizing SO2 again.  The produced crystal of plaster exists in the absorbing liquid in a suspended state, and is discharged to an outside of the bath as one of the absorbing liquid is drawn from the lower portion of the bath 225, and then it is subjected to a solid-liquid separation.  Static type fluid mixer 226 are arranged blow the oxygen dissolving regions 224.  An oxygenation is accelerated by flowing the absorbing liquid and the air in the mixers 226.<br>
Thus, since respective operation of absorbing, oxidization, and crystallization can be realized in one bdLh, Lhe apparatus becomes compact, and any absorbing liquid pump is not required.  Also, the desulfurization is realized efficiently.<br>
