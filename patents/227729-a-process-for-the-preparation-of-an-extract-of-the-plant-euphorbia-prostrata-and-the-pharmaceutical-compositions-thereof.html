				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a novel compositions comprising of an extract of the plant Euphorbia prostrata useful for the treatment of anorectal disease including hemorrhoids and colonic diseases. The novel compositions possess properties to control inflammation, prevent capillary bleeding and fragility in mammalians, particularly human beings.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Among the various anorectal and colonic diseases, hemorrhoids occupy a prominent position and have been the subject of numerous clinical studies. Hemorrhoidal disease is characterised by bleeding, without any pain. Fresh blood spots occur immediately, on defecation. However, pain occurs when the hemorrhoids are secondarily infected, or complicated by thrombosis and anal fissures. Hemorrhoids can be caused by a variety of factors including hormones, genes, inflammation, infection, constipation, exercise, vascular stasis, diet, strain, physical stance in defecation, loss of connective tissue elasticity with age etc. The symptoms most widely recognized are bleeding, pain and prolapse (Hyams and Philpot, 1970; Smith, 1987). These may be accompanied by thrombosis, pruritis, edema etc. Hemorrhoids can be treated through reduction of inflammation and pain, haemostasis, wound healing and protection of vascular walls. Thus, an effective treatment of acute hemorrhoidal attacks should not only provide relief as early as 2-3 days after initiation of the treatment, but also reduce the recurrence of such attacks.<br>
There exist several procedures for the treatment of hemorrhoids. WO8803398 patent application discloses surgical dressings for such treatment. Patents have been granted in respect of surgical devices such as European patent no. 0095142. U.S. Patent no. 4,621,635 has been granted for the use of lasers in the treatment of hemorrhoids. The techniques of cryopharmacotherapy and electrochemical techniques for treatment of hemorrhoids have also been patented vide European patent no. 0091405 and European patent no. 0116688, respectively. However, the biggest drawbacks of the above are the involvement of medical experts beyond mere prescription of medicines and probable hospitalization. Also, some of them are physically and/or psychologically unpleasant in application.<br>
Several patents (U.S. patent nos. 4,160,148, 4,508,728, 4,797,392, 4,518,583 and 5,234,914) have been granted in respect of compositions containing certain wound healing agents to<br><br>
provide symptomatic  relief,  by promoting tissue  repair,  reducing  inflammation and<br>
encouraging wound healing. Some of them like U.S. patent nos. 4,518,583 and 5,234,914 contain antimicrobial agents. These compositions, however, only relieve symptoms associated with inflammation, like heat, itching, redness, pain and swelling.<br>
A number of compositions for the treatment of anorectal diseases (including hemorrhoids) are based on the anesthetic and vasoconstrictive properties of the constituents, but these provide only temporary symptomatic relief.<br>
Patents in the United States of America (U.S. patent nos. 4,613,498, 4,626,433, 5,166,132, 5,219,880, 5,234,914 and 4,797,392) and Europe (European patents nos. 0225832 and 0513442) have been granted in respect of compositions with varying constituents, for topical application in the form of suitable and acceptable pharmaceutical carriers, such as salts, ointments, etc., with organic, inorganic or biological active agents. However, these compositions provide only temporary relief and are limited to local application and cannot be used for systemic use or oral administration.<br>
A topical treatment for hemorrhoidal pain and for spasms of the sphincters and muscles located in the GI tract is disclosed in a granted patent (U.S. patent no. 5,595,753), which includes amino acid L-arginine in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Another U.S. patent no. 5,591,436 has been granted for a composition for dietary supplement for the treatment of hemorrhoids. The composition comprises 60% to 95% Indian Barberry by weight; 4.8% to 38% Nagkesar by weight; and 0.2% to 2% Margosa tree leaves by weight.<br>
Another U.S. patent no. 5,562,906 discloses the use of bark or berries of the species Xanthoxylum clava herculis L and Xanthoxylum americanum Hill, both of the yellow wood tree family, are employed for the treatment of hemorrhoids and other membrane and capillary disorders of the veins and arteries. Improved strength and flexibility of the veins, arteries and their constituent structures is obtained.<br>
The flavonoidal constituents present in the extract of Euphorbia prostrata are reported to have anti-inflammatory properties. The phenolic compounds like ellagic and gallic acids and tannins are reported to have anti-inflammatory, haemostatic, gastro-protective and wound healing properties.<br><br>
Other plants containing flavonoids including apigenin glycosides and luteolin glycosides are<br>
Ixora arhorea (Rubiaceae), Bommervia hispida (Pteridaceae), Adenocalymma alliaceum (Bignomiaceae), Thalictrum thunbergii (Renunculaceae), Perilla frutescens (Labiateae), Chrysenthemum indicum, C. coronarium and Matricaria chamomilla (Compositae), Thymus membranaceous (Labiateae), Digitalis lanata (Scrophulariaceae), Cuminum cyminum and Petroselinum (Umbelliferae). Several species oiEuphorbia like Euphorbia minuta, Euphorbia microfolia, Euphorbia granulata (Euphorbiaceae) contain both apigenin and luteolin. Ellagic acid and other phenolic acids have been reported from different species of Euphorbia.<br>
The safety of various components of the Euphorbia extract has been reported in the literature. Some of the reports also claim anti-mutagenic/ anti-carcinogenic/ anti-genotoxic properties of the components of the Euphorbia extract.<br>
An Indian patent no. 186803 and several other patents (Australia, No. 698407; China, No. CN 1102387C; Europe, No. 868914; Russia, No. 2174396; South Africa, No. 97/2900; South Korea, No. 281679 and U.S., No. 5,858,371) have been granted to this applicant for a composition comprising a flavonoid containing extract of Euphorbia prostrata for treatment of anorectal and colonic diseases. The claimed extract comprises of very high contents of flavonoids (35 - 62% by weight), which is very expensive and time consuming to purify. Further, the presence of the phenolic compounds that are therapeutically useful for treatment of anorectal and colonic diseases due to their hemostatic and astringent properties, has not been established in the claimed extract. The presence of the phenolic compounds like ellagic acid, gallic acid and tannins comprising of these acids makes the claimed extract more effective for treatment of hemorrhoids and other colonic diseases, as the phenolic compounds are known gastroprotective agents. The antimicrobial properties of these phenolic compounds further prevent secondary infections often accompanied with hemorrhoids, fissures, fistulas etc.<br>
Furthermore, the process of extraction described in the said patent application comprises a step of treatment of the combined and concentrated extract with hot water and then taking the water-soluble portion for obtaining the tlavonoidal components. It was discovered in the present invention that the water- soluble portion contains substantial amount of phenolic compounds. The new method of the present invention comprises washing of the extract with hexane where only waxy materials and pigments are removed and there is no significant loss of phenolic compounds.<br><br>
The inventors have further researched, and have found that the novel flavonoid and phenolic<br>
compounds containing extract of Euphorbia prostrata disclosed in the present invention exhibits improved pharmacological response in comparison to existing compositions employing flavonoids either from Euphorbia or other sources. Further, the extraction procedure of the disclosed Euphorbia prostrata extract in the present invention is more cost effective and less time consuming in comparison to that of existing compositions employing flavonoids isolated from Euphorbia prostrata. The commercial implications of the improved and economic extraction procedure led the inventors to re-establish the pharmacological and toxicological validity of the new extract. The results were strikingly better than those of the equivalent flavonoid doses of the more purified extract of Euphorbia prostrata as disclosed earlier.<br>
The present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition that is safe and painless and has long-term effectiveness.<br>
OBJECTIVE OF THE INVENTION<br>
An objective of the present invention is to provide compositions for treating anorectal diseases including hemorrhoids and colonic diseases.<br>
Another objective for the present invention is to provide compositions for treating anorectal and colonic diseases including hemorrhoids comprising of an extract of the plant Euphorbia prostrata containing flavonoids and phenolic compounds, optionally with other therapeutic agent(s) and/or pharmaceutically acceptable carrier(s)/base(s).<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides compositions that can be orally administered as well as uniformly applied to the affected region. It reduces inflammation, and soothes the feeling of itching and burning associated with it. The invention provides relief from pain associated with hemorrhoids. The invention also significantly reduces bleeding and accelerates tissue re-growth in the affected hemorrhoidal tissue. The invention is useful in the treatment of lesions, other than hemorrhoids in the anorectal area and can be formulated in several types of dosage forms. There are no side effects from the use of the composition in human beings. Further, the<br><br>
treatment is not physically or psychologically unpleasant in its administration and/or<br>
application. The plant Euphorbia prostrata (Family: Euphorbiaceae) was identified as being relevant in the study of anorectal and colonic diseases, including hemorrhoids. Euphorbia prostrata is well known to the Indian traditional medicine in the use of treatment for asthma, bloody dysentery and sores. Previously, five new compounds were discovered and identified by the inventors in Euphorbia prostrata namely luteolin, 6-methoxy-quercetin-glycoside, Quercetin, and glycosides of luteolin and apigenin. Now two more phenolic compounds, namely ellagic acid and gallic acid were identified in the extract prepared in a different manner, which were found to be of additional therapeutic value for treatment of hemorrhoids.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are standardized to pharmaceutically acceptable specifications in order to ensure reproducibility from batch to batch. The result is the extract of Euphorbia prostrata, which is the main active agent in the improved anorectal composition. Another unique feature of this extract of Euphorbia prostrata is that it is prepared in such a manner that the resulting composition is easily dispersible in water due to presence of many hydrophilic compounds besides flavonoids.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition comprising of the extract of Euphorbia prostrata as the active ingredient contains flavonoids and phenolic compounds, out of which apigenin-7-glycoside is about 1 - 4% by weight of the extract, luteolin-7-glycoside is about 0.3 - 2% by weight of the extract, and apigenin, luteolin and quercetin are about 0.001 - 0.3% by weight of the extract. The extract also contains 1 - 10% by weight of tannins, 1-15% by weight of ellagic acid, and 1 - 12% by weight of gallic acid.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention. Euphorbia prostrata was found to be devoid of any toxic diterpene content like phorbol or ingenol esters, unlike many other species of Euphorbia.<br>

EVALUATION OF PHARMACOLOGICAL ACTIVITY OF THE EXTRACT<br>
Antihaemorrhoidal activity<br>
The antihaemorrhoidal activity of the Euphorbia prostrata extract was assessed and compared with reference drug, diosmin using anorectal : body weight ratio model in rats (modified method of Jia et al., 2000). Euphorbia prostrata extract (5, 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg, p.o., 7 days) showed significant decrease in anorectal : bodyweight ratio as well as inflammation and redness at the site when compared to control (carrageenan - treated group). Diosmin (50 mg/kg, p.o., 7 days) also significantly decreased anorectal : body weight ratio in rats. Further, individual components of Euphorbia prostrata extract i.e. apigenin-7- glucoside (0.478 mg/kg, p.o.), ellagic acid (1.204 mg/kg, p.o.), and gallic acid (1.123 mg/kg, p.o.) on chronic administration (7 days) also showed effect. In histopathological examination of the anorectum, normal animals administered per orally with 0.5% CMC alone showed intact mucosal layer with prominent mucosal cells and mild leukocyte migration, where as carrageenan - treated animals showed uneven thick mucosal layer with disrupted mucosal cells and severe leukocyte migration suggesting the presence of a significant inflammation. Further, both Euphorbia prostrata extract (10 mg/kg, p.o., 7 days) and diosmin (50mg/kg,<br><br>
p.o., 7 days) showed intact mucosal layer with prominent mucosal cells and mild leukocyte<br>
migration. Anti-inflammatory activity<br>
Carrageenan - induced paw edema in rats<br>
Carrageenan (1% w/v) produced paw edema (Winter et al., 1962) in control group, indicating inflammatory response. Euphorbia prostrata extract (5, 10, 20, and 40 mg/kg, p.o.) dose dependently and significantly decreased carrageenan-induced increase in paw volume as compared to control rats (EDso 15.42 - 15.84 mg/kg, p.o.) The onset of anti-inflammatory effect was rapid and lasted up to 4 hrs after carrageenan injection. The anti-inflammatory effect of Euphorbia prostrata extract at doses 20 and 40 mg/kg was comparable to that of nimesulide (2 mg/kg, p.o.), a preferential cyclooxygenase - 2 (COX - 2) inhibiting NSAID.<br>
Further, solution of Euphorbia prostrata extract (0.5- 4.0 % equivalent to I - 8 mg/kg, applied topically on paw) significantly decreased the carrageenan - induced increase in paw volume. The topical anti-inflammatory effect of Euphorbia prostrata extract (1%) was comparable to that of nimesulide (2%) at 60 min in rats.<br>
Antinociceptive activity<br>
Acetic acid- induced writhing in mice (Koster et al., 1959)<br>
Euphorbia prostrata extract (2 mg/kg, p.o.) exhibited maximum antinociceptive effect after 90 minutes of its administration in time response study. This effect lasted up to 2 hrs of its administration. Nimesulide (2 mg/kg), a reference drug also significantly increased the pain threshold in mice. Euphorbia prostrata extract (I, 2, 5, and 10 mg/kg, p.o.) produced dose -dependent antinociceptive effect in mice. Apigenin -7- glucoside (0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg/kg, p.o.) and luteolin glucoside (0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 mg/kg, p.o.) also exhibited dose-dependent antinociceptive effect in writhing test.<br>
Carrageenan — induced hyperalgesia in rats<br>
Carrageenan (1% w/v) significantly decreased paw withdrawal latency in paw pressure test (Randall and Selitto,   1957). Euphorbia prostrata extract (10, 20, and 40 mg/kg, p.o.)<br><br>
significantly increased paw withdrawal latency as compared to carrageenan - treated rats.<br>
Nimesulide (2 mg/kg), a reference drug also increased paw withdrawal latencies in rats.<br>
Carrageenan - induced pleurisy in rats<br>
Pleurisy was induced with carrageenan using a method reported by Engelhard et al., 1995. A single-dose administration of Euphorbia prostrata extract (20 and 40 mg/kg, p.o.) produced significant inhibition of exudates formation and migration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and monocytes in carrageenan-induced pleurisy.<br>
Superoxide radical scavenging activity<br>
Euphorbia prostrata extract (25 µg) exhibited a superior superoxide radical scavenging activity of 38.70% in comparison to tocopherol (25µg), which showed a similar activity of 25.54%.<br>
Wound healing activity in rats<br>
The wounds were developed by skin excision method in rats as described by Vishnu Rao et al., 1996. Euphorbia prostrata extract cream (1.75%) showed significant wound healing activity in comparison to placebo cream on Day 4, 8, and 12 in wound excision model in rats.<br>
Haemostatic activity<br>
Euphorbia prostrata extract (1%, 2%, and 4% solution) significantly reduced the bleeding time as compared to control group (distilled water). Moreover, the reduction in bleeding time with 4% solution of Euphorbia prostrata extract was comparable to 2.5% solution of alginic acid.<br>
MECHANISM OF ANTI-HEMORRHOIDAL ACTIVITY OF THE EXTRACT:<br>
Euphorbia prostrata extract mainly comprises of flavonoids (apigenin -7- glucoside, luteolin -7 -glucoside), ellagic acid, gallic acid, and tannins. Phenolic compounds are widespread in the plant kingdom. The major groups of phenolic compounds are flavonoids and phenolic acids. They are one of the main constituents of several medicinal plants that have been used as folk medicine throughout the world. Interest has recently been focused on flavonoids and flavanoids because of their broad pharmacological activities. These flavonoids are well<br><br>
reported for analgesic, anti-Inflammatory, antioxidant, antiangiogenic, anti-allergic, antiviral<br>
and antimutagenic activity (Lin et al., 2001; Formica and Regelson, 1995; Fotsis et al., 1997; Wang et al., 1998; Block et al., 1998). It is reported that apigenin is a most potent inhibitor of transcriptional activation of both COX-2 and iNOS enzyme in lipopolysaccharide activated RAW 264.7 macrophages. It is further suggested that suppression of transcriptional activation of COX-2 and iNOS by apigenin might mainly be mediated through inhibition of IKB (inhibitor of KB). Such type of modulation of COX-2 and iNOS by apigenin may be important in the prevention of carcinogenesis and inflammation (Liang et al., 1999). Further, it is also suggested that antioxidant properties of apigenin -7 - glucoside contribute to its anti¬inflammatory activity in various animal models (Fuchs and Milbradt, 1993). Delia Loggia et al, 1986 also reported that apigenin -7-glucoside and luteolin -7 -galactoside shows a dose dependent inhibition of the oedematous response to croton oil. In CCl4 - induced peroxidation, apigenin and luteolin had shown significant antiperoxidative activity in rat liver microsomes (Cholbi et al., 1991). Xagorari et al., 2001 reported that luteolin inhibits protein tyrosin phosphorylation, nuclear factor- ΚB mediated gene expression and pro-inflammatory cytokine production in murine macrophages. Ellagic acid is one of the major constituents of Euphorbiaprostrata extract also reported to suppress histamine release mediated by histamine liberators (compound 48/80, dextran and polymyxin B sulfate) in vivo (Bhargava and Westfall, 1969). Moreover, the anti-inflammatory effects of flavonoids comprise inhibition of histamine release, modulation of the prostanoids metabolism and antioxidant properties. It is speculated that analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activity of various flavonoid components of Euphorbia prostrata extract (apigenin-7- glucoside, luteolin -7 -glucoside) and ellagic acid and/or gallic acid may contribute in healing of inflammatory tissue damage in hemorrhoidal conditions.<br>
Phenolic acids are reported to activate intrinsic blood coagulation by activation of Hageman factor and cause a state of hypercoagulability. Although the hypercoagulable state persists for as long as 4 hours after i.v. administration, no thrombotic phenomena has been reported (Girolami and Cliffton, 1967).<br>
Vegetable tannins are water-soluble phenolic compounds including both hydrolysable and condensed tannins that are present in every food plant. Hydrolysable tannins contain either gallotannins or ellagiotannins that yield gallic acid or ellagic acid respectively on hydrolysis. It is well reported that tannic acid has antimicrobial properties, which is associated with the ester linkage between gallic acid and other sugar or alcohol groups (Chung et al, 1993; 1995).<br><br>
From the anti-hemorrhoidal studies conducted in animals, it is evident that the Euphorbia<br>
prostrata extract has better efficacy than the purified flavonoids or other constituents alone.<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
General process of manufacture of the Extract:<br>
Qualified professionals collected the plant Euphorbia prostrata from various parts of India. The plant was identified and characterized according to WHO guidelines (WHO/TRM/91.4, Programme Traditional Medicines World Health Organization Geneva, 1991) and was dried under controlled conditions of temperature and humidity. The whole plant was ground to coarse powder. The coarse powder was extracted using a polar solvent like an alkanol or acetone with or without water. The extract was concentrated and washed with a non-polar solvent like a hydrocarbon or chlorinated hydrocarbon. The washed extract was optionally further extracted into a medium polar solvent like ethyl acetate or ethyl methyl ketone. The<br><br>
final extract was optionally dehydrated with a suitable dehydrating agent and dried, either in a<br>
tray drier or in a spray drier, milled to a powder form, sifted to the desired particle size and packed in a suitable container to protect from moisture.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
The powdered drug (500 kg) was packed in a S.S. extractor. The extraction was affected by percolation with 3000 It. of 80% aqueous methanol at about 60°C. The process was repeated 5 times till the drug was exhausted. The aqueous-methanolic extracts were combined and concentrated by distillation. The concentrated extract was washed with 5-10 volumes of hexane to remove the wax and fatty material. The washed extract was dried completely for several hours at 60°C under vacuum. The final extract was milled to a fine powder, sifted for uniform particle size and packed to protect from the moisture.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
The powdered drug (700 kg) was packed in a S.S. extractor. The extraction was affected by percolation with 4500 It. of methanol at about 60°C. The process was repeated 5 times till the drug was exhausted. The methanolic extracts were combined and concentrated by distillation. The concentrated extract was washed with 5-10 volumes of dichloromethane to remove the wax and fatty material. The washed extract was dried completely for several hours at 60°C under vacuum. The final extract was milled to a fine powder, sifted for uniform particle size and packed to protect from the moisture.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
The powdered drug (350 kg) was packed in a S.S. extractor. The extraction was affected by percolation with 3000 It. of 80% aqueous acetone at about 50°C. The process was repeated 5 times till the drug was exhausted. The aqueous-acetone extracts were combined and concentrated by distillation. The concentrated extract was washed with 5-10 volumes of hexane to remove the wax and fatty material. The washed extract was dried completely for several hours at 60°C under vacuum. The tlnal extract was milled to a fine powder, sifted for uniform particle size and packed to protect from the moisture.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
The powdered drug (500 kg) was packed in a S.S. extractor. The extraction was affected by percolation with 3000 It. of 80% aqueous methanol at about 60°C. The process was repeated 5 times till the drug was exhausted. The aqueous-methanolic extracts were combined and concentrated by distillation. The concentrated extract was washed with 5-10 volumes of hexane to remove the wax and fatty material. The washed extract was again extracted with ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate extract was dehydrated with anhydrous sodium sulphate and concentrated by distillation. The concentrated extract was dried completely for several hours at 60°C under vacuum. The final purified extract was milled to a fine powder, sifted for uniform particle size and packed to protect from the moisture.<br>
Process of evaluation of the Extract<br>
The extract of Euphorbia prostrata of the above-mentioned examples was characterised by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). The HPLC was performed under following conditions and using Waters system equipped with M510 pumps and data station with Millenium software.<br>
Mobile phase: A linear gradient of Mobile Phase A (2% acetic acid in Water) and Mobile Phase B (2% acetic acid in Acetonitrile) according to the following table:<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Column: C18 (250X4.6 mm/5   !)<br>
Flow Rate: 1 ml/min<br>
Detector: UV absorbance at 335 nm<br><br>
The HPLC chromatogram showed a number of peaks, the major ones corresponding to galHc<br>
acid, ellagic acid, luteolin glucoside and apigenin glucoside. The two peaks corresponding to the flavonoid components luteolin glucoside and apigenin glucoside were used as the chemical and pharmacological marker for quantitation of the product. A sum of the two peaks was calculated corresponding to standard apigenin glucoside and the measure was expressed as the Total Flavonoids.<br>

EVALUATION OF CLINICAL EFFICACY OF CAPSULES AND CREAM<br>
The effective dose of extract of Euphorbia prostrata in nociceptive and inflammatory animal models varied from 5-20 mg/kg in mice and rats. Moreover, the maximum tolerable dose is more than 2000 mg/kg in mice and rats. Based on body surface area to body weight ratios, the expected dose of extract of Euphorbia prostrata for human studies could be in between 50 -200 mg for 60 kg human being (Paget and Barnes, 1964; Freireich et al., 1966). It is observed that the maximum human therapeutic dose (200 mg for 60 kg human being) is approximately 57 and 112 times less than the maximum dose employed in the acute toxicity studies in mice and rats respectively calculated based on body surface area to body weight ratios.<br>
Results of the clinical trials conducted at RML and LNJP hospitals, Delhi (India)<br>
The optimal dose, efficacy, safety and patient tolerability of 50 and 100 mg capsule formulations of extract of Euphorbia prostrata in hemorrhoidal attacks was evaluated in a double blind, placebo controlled, prospective, comparative and a randomized study. The duration of study was 8 months and protocol therapy was for 10 days.<br>
A total of 125 patients entered the study, out of which 72 patients suffered from degree I hemorrhoids and 53 patients suffered from degree II hemorrhoids. The patients in each category were randomized into 3 treatment groups i.e. TDA, TDB and TDC (i.e. 50 mg, 100 mg and placebo capsules). All patients were evaluated on day 5 and day 10 of starting therapy. A follow up of 3 months was done.<br>
The clinical examination was carried out to score the signs and symptoms i.e. proctorrhagia, anal discomfort, pain, anal discharge and proctitis at Day 0, Day 5 and Day 10. The degree of improvement on individual clinical parameters was also assessed from day 0, Day 5 and Day 10. The number of episodes of bleeding with bowel action and utilization of analgesics and topical medication as rescue medication was also assessed at Day 0, Day 5, and Day 10.<br>
For statistical description, all patients were included in "Intent to treaf analysis. Kruskal Wallis test and Wilcoxan signed rank test for qualitative variables and paired t-test and one¬way ANOVA for quantitative analysis were applied.<br><br>
The study demonstrated that 100 mg capsule of extract of Euphorbia prostrata (TDB) and 50 mg capsule of extract of Euphorbia prostrata (TDA) was generally more effective than placebo (TDC) group in all the efficacy parameters of hemorrhoids.<br>
All the groups tolerated the drugs well and showed minimal side effects. All the laboratory parameters were normal at baseline as well as at the end of the therapy in all the 3 treatment groups.<br>
Previous studies have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of extract of Euphorbia prostrata in the treatment of hemorrhoids in an uncontrolled fashion. In this study, extract of Euphorbia prostrata in two doses i.e. 50 and 100 mg showed good efficacy in treatment of hemorrhoids. However clinically, TDB group (100 mg capsule) showed better results in overall therapeutic evaluation.<br>
In Degree I hemorrhoids, certain parameters in TDA group showed better results. From the analysis it was found that out of the three treatment groups, maximum number of patients in TDB group underwent 5-day therapy. The prolonged 10-day therapy in TDA group might attribute to the better response in some parameters. However, at day 5, in few evaluation parameters i.e., and discomfort and proctorrhagia, complete recovery was found in maximum number of patients in TDB group.<br>
When the assessment on the degree of improvement in overall signs and symptoms of hemorrhoidal attacks was done, highest number of patients in TDB group showed substantial improvement at both assessment day i.e. Day 5 and Day 10. Clinically TDB group showed the better decrease in bleeding episodes at both Day 5 and Day 10. At 3 months follow up; both treatment groups i.e. TDA and TDB groups were found to be quite effective in terms of non-reoccurrence of bleeding.<br>
It was found that although bleeding reoccurred in slightly more number of patients in TDB group, no treatment was needed in highest number of patients in TDB than TDA group. It<br>
Also, at Day 5, TDB proved to be a better drug in bringing about complete disappearance of signs and symptoms of hemorrhoidal attacks. The better results shown by TDB group at Day 5 than at day 10 may be attributed to the fact that of all the treatment groups, highest number of patients in TDB groups underwent 5-day therapy and did not require prolonged therapy of 10 days. At 3 months follow up analysis; TDB was found to be better in all the aspects.<br><br>
The use of rescue medication in Degree I and Degree II hemorrhoids was seen in lesser number of patients in TDB group at the end of therapy i.e. Day 10. The impact of rescue medication might also explain some better results seen with lesser dose of 50 mg (TDA) as compared to high dose 100 mg (TDB) in few parameters.<br><br><br><br><br>
