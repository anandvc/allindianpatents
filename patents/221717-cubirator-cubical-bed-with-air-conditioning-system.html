Detail description with drawings :<br>
Fig. - (1) is an isometric view of the cubical bed system with air conditioning.<br>
Cubicle bed with air conditioning system is made in size of 3'X6' with height of bed 1' to 1 1/2' &amp; the cubicle above the bed is of about 4 feet. 4 legs of bed are extended above the bed surface, front side of bed &amp; top are covered by glass &amp; wooden panel. On the backside or headside of bed evaporated coil / fen coil system is fitted which contain evaporated coil &amp; fan motor. The coil is connected from suction &amp; discharge line to the refrigerent system. The refrigerent system can be designed in 3 ways as described earlier, In the diagram second design is shown. On the right &amp; left hand side of the bed there is provision of entrance door. The refrigerent system below is containing compressor, condenser, fan motor, piping &amp; electrical wiring as described earlier &amp; shown in the diagram.<br><br><br>
EXPLATION OF INVENTIONS FUTURE:<br>
A&gt; The invention cubirator is unique systems in its own.lt is a cubicle bed in which upper surface of bed is enclosed to seprate from enviroment of surroundings by putting a insulated wall with doors for entry. The other unique feature is that surface of bed can move as per-requirement.<br>
The Air-Conditioning system is different, inventive and unique. The Air-conditioning Can be explained by a diagram and can be explained as follows:-<br>
1. Systems is devided in two parts First fan coil unit, Which camprise of a colling coil made up of metal up of metal allumenium and copper the restriction device for refrigerant is specific and uniquely designed to minimise flow of refrigerant by reducing its bore in step down fession and it is sprey in colling coil by multiple small holes and it brought down temprature in minus the effect of this occur that moisture of air get condensate on colling coil this reduces moisure contents in air and the air temprature goes up to 4 degree or as low which is not possible in general air conditions.<br>
After uniting colling effect in coil refrigerant goes to compressor which is a low temperture cpmprasser it comprasses refrigerant to condensor and it get condensated by atmosphere temprature only which is different from generally available air conditioners in-Which fen is required for condensation.<br>
To get heating in cubirator there is a solonoid valve which reverse the cycle.<br>
B&gt; As we explained that it is different from general room air conditioners is as follows-<br>
In Cubirator  temperature of colling coil is brought down  to minus by putting specific restraction device so temperature of air come down as .<br>
Low as 4 to minus degree it gives early colling) at low power consumption in normaly available air Conditioners/tempteture of coollig coil does not go as low as cubirator it is in plus so air Passing from coil caries temprature from 4 to 8 degree.<br><br>
C&gt; There are some modififaction to normal room air condition in this systems are follows :-<br>
Normal room air conditioners carry (capillary as restriction device but in our system restriction of refrigerant is done step down mannerin whic refrigerant passes from restriction device where it redused in bore as shown in diagram.<br>
The gape of fins in colling ciol is high so air can pass easily even after ice formation on<br>
Ice formation is required to reduce moisture up to low degree. <br>
In few design there is need not to put fan condencer which is different to normal air<br>
conditioners.	<br>
Cubirator is a bed which is different to normal beds also because it is seprated by environment by insulated wall &amp; surface can be adjustes as per comfort level.<br>
UNIQUE FEATURE OF SYATEMS ARE<br>
&gt;We are using principle of refrigeration to cool air which is  going to  be usedd for domestic air conditioning is our claims.Temperature of colling coil will go in minus. So,humidity level of air will go down &amp; it will be of low temperature this is achieved by using low temperature compressor &amp; by using very narrow &amp; restriction device.<br>
&gt;Condenser is designed in such a way fan motor may not require for condencation it gives again saving by avoiding an additional fan motor for condenser is unique ofour claim.<br><br><br>
