 <br>
In the present invention, a process of producing the coated pesticide will be described below using an example of the case where the thermosetting resin is a polyurethane resin.<br>
A process of producing the coated pesticide in which the thermosetting resin is a polyurethane resin usually comprises steps of (1) mixing a powdery pesticide and polyol, (2) adding polyisocyanate to the mixture obtained in the previous step, (3) allowing polyol to react with polyisocyanate to produce a thermosetting resin to obtain an agglomerate in which the powdery pesticide is solidified with the polyurethane resin, and (4) adding polyol and polyisocyanate simultaneously or sequentially to the agglomerate of the powdery pesticide obtained in the previous step to react the polyol and the polyisocyanate, thereby coating the agglomerate with the polyurethane resin. In the step (1), usually, polyol is added to a powdery pesticide in the flowing or rolling srate in a container to mix the powdery pesticide and the polyol in the container. In the step (2), usually, polyisocyanate is added to the mixture obtained in the previous step which is in the flowing or rolling state in the container.  In the step (3), usually, the polyol and the polyisocyanate react to cure the polyurethane resin, while providing a suitable shearing force ro the mixture obtained in the previous Step by means<br>
 <br>
of rotating blades or the like, and thereby the polyurethane resin intervenes between particles of the powdery pesticide to produce an agglomerate of the powdery pesticide.  When the amount of the added polyurethane resin is small relative to the amount of the powdery pesticide, the steps (1) to (3) are appropriately repeated to obtain an agglomerate.  Then, in the step (4), usually, polyoi and polyisocvanate are simultaneously or sequentially added to the agglomerate obtained in the previous step while allowing the agglomerate to flow or roll in a container, and a suitable shearing force is provided to the resulting mixture by means of rotating blades or the like, thereby the polyol and the polyisocyanate react to coat the agglomerate with the polyurethane resin.  In addition, the step {4} is repeated a plurality of times if necessary until a coating of the polyurethane resin having a suitable thickness is obtained.<br>
In the process of producing the coated pesticide as described above, examples of the container for miaintaining the powdery pesticide in the flowing or rolling state in the step (1) or the like include pan-type or a dram-type containers equipped with an appropriate stirring means. The steps {1) to (4) are performed in a nitrogen atmosphere usuallv at 0 to 10u°C, and preferably at 10 to 80°C.  In the step (3)  the time required for the cure of a<br>
 <br>
polyurethane resin varies depending on the operation temperature, the kinds of polyoi and polyisocyanate, the presence or the absence of a curing catalyst, or the like. In the step (3), a shearing force is provided to a mixture of the powdery pesticide and an uncured polyurethane resin by means of rotating blades or the like to such an extent that an agglomerate having an appropriate parricle diameter can be produced from the powdery pesticide by allowing the polyurethane resin to intervene between particles of the powdery pesticide.  Specifically, the rotating speed of the blade at the tip portion is 50 to 3000 m/min, preferably 100 to 2000 m/min, more preferably 200 to 1000 m/min.<br>
The total amount of polyoi and polyisocyanate added in one operation at the step (1) and the step (2), or the step (4), that is, the amount of an uncured polyurethane resin varies depending on the kind of a polyurethane resin, the operation temperature, an instrument used or the like, and it is usually in the range of 0.3 to 15 parts by weight, preferably 0.5 to 10 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the powdery pesticide.<br>
Specific examples of a container that can be used in the production process of the present invention include an apparatus in which particles circulate along the circumference of a container, such as NEW-GRA Machine (manuracrured by Seishin Enterprise Co., Lrd.}, and an<br>
 <br>
apparatus comprising a low-speed rotation agitator in a mixer and a high-speed rotation chopper at a side portion, which can mix, disperse and shear loaded raw materials with the action of both blades in a short time, such as High Speed Mixer and High Flex Gral (manufactured by Fukae Powtec).  Further examples of an apparatus having the similar performance include High Speed Mixer (manufactured by Freund), Vertical Granulator (manufactured by Powlex Corporation), and New Speed Mill (manufactured by Ok^da Seiko Co., Ltd.).  Specific examples thereof include the apparatus described in JP-A 9-75703.<br>
The amount of the thermosetting resin to be contained in the coated pesticide is usually 5 to 150 parts by weight, preferably 10 to 100 parts by weight, more preferably 20 to 80 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the powdery pesticide.<br>
In the present invention, the coated pesticide is a powder having a volume median diameter of 10 to 150 pm, preferably a powder having a volume median diameter of 10 to 80 \im.<br>
The shaoe of the coaled pesticide is usually almost spherical.  The bulk density of rhe coated pesticide is preferably 1.0 g/ml or less, more preferably 0.6 g/ml or less.<br>
.-Ll-houch calci'Oir. carbonate is roughly classified into<br>
 <br>
two kinds of heavy calcium carbonate and precipitated calcium carbonate depending on its production process, the calcium carbonate micropowder having a bulk density of 0.6 g/ml or less in the powdery pesticidal composition of the present invention may be any calcium carbonate.<br>
Heavy calcium carbonate is also called natural calcium carbonate, and is produced by mechanically dry- or wet-grinding and classifying a natural raw material containing CaCOs as the main comiponent such as limestone, shell exoskeleton or chalk.<br>
Precipitated calcium carbonate is also called synthetic calcium carbonate, and is produced by a carbonic acid gas method which comprises dissolving calcined lime obtained by firing limestone in water to obtain lime milk, and then blowing carbonic acid gas into the lime milk, or a soluble salt reaction method which comprises allowing calcium chloride or lime milk to react with soda ash in water.<br>
The calcium carbonate used in the present invention usually has a specific surface area of 1 to 100 m^/g, preferably 0.5 to 50 m"/g.  The specific surface area of calcium carbonate can be measured, for example, by the BET method {a method which comprises adsorbing an inert gas molecule such as nitrogen, wherein the area occupied by the adsorocion of "he molecule is known, onto the surface of a<br>
 <br>
powder particle at the temperature of liquid nitrogen, and calculating the specific surface area of a sample from the adsorption amount of the molecule).<br>
The calcium carbonate used in the present invention has a bulk density of 0.6 g/ml or less, preferably a bulk density in the range of 0.01 to 0.3 g/ml.  In the present invention, a bulk density is measured according to the "Physical Property Testing Method" of Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry Notification (February 3, 1960, Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry Notification No.71). Specifically, a bulk density is measured, for example, by the following method.<br>
A standard sieve (opening 0.175 ram) is placed on a metal cylindrical container having a volume of 100 ml and a diameter of 50 mm so that the distance between the net of the sieve and the upper edge of the container can be kept at 20 cm.  A measurement sample is sieved, and is filled into the container.  Immediately, the excess sample is removed using a slide glass, and the filled container is weighed to calculate the weight (g) of the content.  Then, a bulk density is calculated by the following calculation equation: Bulk density (g/ml) = weight [g) of content/100 (ml).<br>
The powdery pesticidal comiposition of the present invention is obuained by mLixing the coated pesticide and<br>
 <br>
the calcium carbonate, and the weight ratio of the coated pesticide and the calcium carbonate is in the range of 100:1 to 100:30, preferably in the range of 100:2 to 100:20, more preferably in the range of 100:4 to 100:15.<br>
The powdery pesticidal composition of the present invention can be easily prepared by mixing the coated pesticide and "che calcium carbonate in a container equipped with a stirring means.  Examples of the container equipped with a stirring means include the above-described containers used in the process for producing the coated pesticide.  In rhe production of the coated pesticide, after a coating of the thermosetting resin is completely cured, a predetermined amount of calcium carbonate can be added to and mixed with the coated pesticide to prepare the powdery pesticidal composition of the present invention.<br>
The powdery pesticidal composition of the present invention obtained by uniformly mixing a predetermined amount of calcium carbonate with the coated pesticide has good flowability as a powder body.  For example, it is easy to discharge the powdery pesticidal composition from a stirrer which is used in the production of the coated pesticide, and bridging is hardly generated when the powdery pesticidal composition is discharged from a container s-jic'r,  as a hopper.  In addition, when the powdery pes::icidal cor.pcsiticn of Tine present invention is direcrly<br>
 <br>
sprayed to pests to be controlled or plants or soil to be protected, a normal duster such as a powder duster can be used. In addition, the powdery pesticidal composition of the present invention can be mixed with an pesticidally<br>
active compound different from the pesticidally active compound contained in the coated pesticide, if necessary, and then used.<br>
