				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to processes for the manufacture of (3R, 5R)-7-[2-(4-fluorophenyl)-5-isopropyl-3-phenyl-4- [(4-hydroxy methyl phenyl amino) carbonyl]-pyrrol-l-yl]-3,5-dihydroxy-heptanoic acid hemi calcium salt.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Cardiovascular disease and its associated maladies, dysfunctions and complications are a principal cause of disability and the chief cause of death. One specific factor significantly contributing to this pathophysiologic process is atherosclerosis, which has been generally recognized as a leading health care problem both with respect to mortality and health care costs. Atherosclerosis is characterized by the deposition of fatty substances, primarily cholesterol, resulting in plaque formation on the inner surface of the arterial wall and degenerative change to the arteries.<br>
It is now well established that cardiovascular disorders including myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease, hypertension and hypotension, cerebrovascular disorders including stroke, cerebral thrombosis and memory loss due to stroke; peripheral vascular disease and intestinal infarction are caused by blockage of arteries and arterioles by atherosclerotic plaque. Atherosclerotic plaque formation is multi-factorial in its production. Hypercholesterolemia, especially elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), is an important risk factor for atherosclerosis and arteriosclerosis and associated diseases.<br>
The HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) have been used in reducing blood levels of LDL cholesterol. Cholesterol is produced via the mevalonic acid pathway. Reducing the formation of mevalonic acid, a precursor to cholesterol, leads to a corresponding decrease in hepatic cholesterol biosynthesis with a reduction in the cellular pool of cholesterol. PCT Publication No. WO 2004/106299 discloses (3R, 5R)-7-[2-(4-fluorophenyl)-5-isopropyl-3-phenyl-4-[(4-hydroxy methyl phenyl amino)carbonyl]-pyrrol-l-yl]-3,5-dihydroxy-heptanoic acid hemi calcium salt, having the Formula I,<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
as an effective HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A) reductase inhibitor and thus is useful as hypolipidemic and hypocholesterolemic agent.<br>
A procedure for the synthesis of (3R, 5R)-7-[2-(4-fiuorophenyl)-5- isopropyl-3-phenyl-4-[(4-hydroxy methyl phenyl amino)carbonyl]-pyrrol-l-yl]-3,5-dihydroxy-heptanoic acid hemi calcium salt is disclosed in WO 2004/106299. The aforementioned synthetic route involves isolation and purification of intermediates at each step of the process by column chromatography. However, the total overall yield is low, and the high cost of production render the process not amenable to large scale manufacture.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
In one aspect, herein are provided improved processes for the manufacture of compound of Formula I, described above, at a commercial scale.<br>
In another aspect, herein are provided improved processes which avoid the use of column chromatography as a purification method, and are cost effective and easily amenable to large-scale production.<br>
In yet another aspect, herein are provided processes of making high purity compound of Formula I with increased overall yield by employing reaction conditions that include varoius solvents and solvent combinations, temperature conditions, time period and work-up procedures at each stage of the process. Also, in still another aspect, herein is provided isolation of intermediates of high purity with superior yields without resorting to purification by column chromatography at any stage of the process.<br>
In still another aspect, herein are provided one-pot processes for the conversion of a particular dihydroxy compound to the desired calcium salt of Formula I in the final step, thus making the processes more economical.<br>
As discussed, herein are provided processes for the preparation of a compound of Formula I.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The compound of Formula I, (3R,5R)-7-[2-(4-fiuorophenyl)-5-isopropyl-3-phenyl-4-[(4-hydroxymethylphenyl amino)carbonyl]-pyrrol-l -yl]-3,5-dihydroxy-heptanoic acid hemi calcium salt can be prepared by, for example, the following reaction sequence as depicted in Scheme I.<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br><br>
Thus, the amine of Formula II when reacted with methyl-4-methyl-3-oxopentanoate in refluxing hydrocarbon solvent can result in a P-ketoamide of Formula IV (wherein R is aryl, alkyl or arylalkyl). The compound of Formula IV on reaction with benzaldehyde can<br>
 (Formula Removed)<br>
afford a compound of Formula V, which is a mixture of E &amp; Z isomers. The compound of Formula V on subjecting to acylion condensation with 4-fluorobenzaldehyde can afford a 1,4 diketo compound of Formula VI. The compound of Formula VI on condensation with chiral amine of Formula VII can result in a compound of Formula VIII, which on subsequent deprotection can give a compound of Formula IX. Selective reduction of carboxyl group in compound of Formula IX can afford a compound of Formula X. Acid catalyzed cleavage of the ketal group in compound of Formula X can result in a dihydroxy compound of Formula XI which can be converted into calcium salt of the desired Formula I in two ways:<br>
i)   by directly converting the compound of Formula XI into its hemi calcium salt<br>
of Formula I under phase transfer catalysis using Ca(OH)2, or ii) by converting the compound of Formula XI to its sodium salt, generated in situ,<br>
using sodium hydroxide and subsequent displacement of sodium with Ca using<br>
calcium acetate or calcium chloride to generate the hemi calcium salt of<br>
Formula I.<br>
The reaction of an amine of Formula II with 4-methyl-3-oxopentanoate can be carried out in one or more solvents, for example, hydrocarbon solvents (e.g., hexane, heptane, xylene or toluene, in presence of an organic base, for example, triethylamine, pyridine or 1, 2-ethylenediamine in a catalytic amount.<br>
The reaction of a compound of Formula IV with benzaldehyde can be carried out in one or more solvents, for example, hexane, heptane or toluene, in presence of an organic base, for example, piperidine, pyridine or P-alanine, and an organic acid, for example, glacial acetic acid or benzoic acid.<br>
The reaction of a compound of Formula V with 4-fluorobenzaldehyde can be carried out in presence of a catalyst (e.g., sodium cyanide, 3-ethyl-5-(2-hydroxy- ethyl)-4-methyl thiazolium bromide or 3-benzyl-5-(2-hydroxyethyl)-4-methyl thiazolium chloride), in a solvent-free environment, or in a solvent, for example, polar solvent (e.g., methanol, ethanol, propanol or isopropanol), ether solvent (e.g., dioxane, diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran) or mixtures thereof, or in presence of an organic base (e.g., triethylamine or pyridine). Alternatively, the reaction can be carried out in the presence of excess base, for example, triethylamine which itself acts as a solvent.<br>
The reaction of a compound of Formula VI with a compound of Formula VII can be carried out in one or more solvents, for example, hydrocarbon solvents (e.g., xylene, toluene, hexane or heptane), ether solvents (e.g., tetrahydrofuran or dioxane) or mixtures thereof, in the presence of an organic acid, for example, pivalic acid or p-toluene sulfonic acid.<br>
The deprotection of a compound of Formula VIII can be carried out at temperatures ranging from about 10 °C to reflux temperature, for example, at temperatures ranging from about 40 to about 50 °C, in presence of an inorganic base (e.g., sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate or potassium bicarbonate); in one or more solvents, for example, polar solvents (e.g., methanol, ethanol, acetonitrile, isopropyl alcohol or t-butanol) or ether solvents (e.g., tetrahydrofuran, diethyl ether or dioxane) or mixtures thereof. Alternatively, deprotection can be carried out under phase transfer catalysis using TBAB in aqueous alcoholic solvents, for example, ethanol or methanol at reflux temperatures.<br>
The reduction of a compound of Formula IX can be carried out in presence of a reducing agent (e.g., boron-dimethylsulfide complex or boron-tetrahydrofuran complex); in one or more solvents, for example, hydrocarbon solvents (e.g., hexane, n-heptane or toluene), ether solvents (e.g., tetrahydrofuran, dioxane or diethyl ether) or mixtures thereof.<br>
The cleavage of the ketal group of a compound of Formula X with an acid (e.g., hydrochloric acid) can be carried out at temperatures ranging from about room temperature (about 25 °C) to reflux temperature, preferably at temperatures ranging from about 40 to about 55 °C in one or more solvents, for example, polar solvents (e.g., methanol, ethanol or isopropyl alcohol), ether solvents (e.g., tetrahydrofuran, dioxane or diethyl ether) or combination thereof.<br>
The compound of Formula XI can be converted into its corresponding hemi calcium salt of formula I either:<br>
i)   by first converting Formula XI compound into its sodium salt by treatment with NaOH at temperature ranging from about 0 to about 30 °C, for example, at temperature ranging from about 0 to about 10 °C and subsequent displacement<br>
of sodium with calcium using calcium acetate in the presence of one or more alcoholic solvents, for example, methanol, ethanol, etc. or ether solvents {e.g., tetrahydrofuran, dioxane or diethyl ether) or combinations thereof, or ii) by subjecting Formula XI compound to phase transfer catalysis using<br>
tetrabutylammonium bromide as the catalyst and calcium hydroxide as the base in refluxing aqueous alcoholic solvent, for example, methanol or ethanol.<br>
The process described above may involve one or more of the following embodiments. For example, the reaction of the compound of Formula II can be carried out in toluene. The reaction of the compound of Formula V can be carried out in presence of triethylamine, which itself can act as a solvent. The reaction of the compound of Formula VIII can be carried out in acetonitrile or methanol: tetrahydrofuran (1:3), in presence of sodium hydroxide at temperatures ranging from about 50 to about 55 °C for about 4-5 hours or, for example, at about 30 °C for about 8-10 hours. The reaction of the compound of Formula IX can be carried out at temperatures ranging from about 40 to about 45 °C for about 5 hours. The reaction of the compound of Formula X can be carried out in methanol: tetrahydrofuran: water (1:1:1). The reaction of the compound of Formula XI can be carried out tetrahydrofuran: de-ionized water (1:1) or ethanol: water (4:1), in presence of tetrabutylammonium bromide at a temperature ranging from about 30 to about 50 °C for about 2-8 hours.<br>
The process as enumerated above has an advantage that, none of the steps involve the use of column chromatography as a purification method, thus enables such processes to achieve high yields and makes them amenable to large-scale production.<br>
