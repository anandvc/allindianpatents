Generally, a desk comprises an upper panel providing a working place, a drawer provided under the upper panel and in which books and other items are received, and a stand for supporting the drawer at both sides.<br>
Referring to Fig. 4, a drawer 120 having an interior space 121 therein is secured to the bottom of an upper panel 110 made of wood using screws or rivets.<br>
Since the drawer 120 is fixed to the upper panel 110 by a plurality of screws or rivets, assembling or disassembling work of the desk is complicated and consumes a lot of time. Further, since the bottom surface of the upper panel 110 is usually damaged by such riveting work, the bottom surface of<br>
1<br><br>
the upper panel cannot be used instead of the upper surface of the panel in the case that the upper surface of the upper panel is damaged.<br>
Accordingly, to solve the problem above, a stand 130 is used. That is, the drawer 120 is simply placed on the stand 130, and the upper panel 110 is placed on the drawer 120. The stand 130 is secured to the bottom surface of the upper panel 110 by bolts and nuts. Therefore, the drawer 120 is not secured to the upper panel 110 and the stands 130. Accordingly, when an external impact is applied to the desk, the drawer 120 is easily separated from the upper panel 110 and/or the drawer 120 can be broken, and the bolt and nut assembly is loosened, so that the upper panel 110 and the stand 130 may be separated.<br>
Further, since the drawer is made of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) resin, it is easily deformed by load etc. and the deformed drawer must be replaced with a new one.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described below in more detail in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates an exploded desk having a fixing mechanism in accordance with the present invention.<br>
Referring to Fig. 1, a desk in accordance with the present invention comprises an upper panel 110, a drawer 120 opened at an upper part and a front part thereof, and having a recess 121 to receive things such as books therein, an intermediate frame 2 received into grooves formed at side edge portions of the drawer 120 and secured to a stand 130, and the stand" 130 placed on the ground and supporting the intermediate frame 2 at both sides. Bolts 140 penetrate the upper panel 110, the drawer 120 and the intermediate frame 2<br>
5<br><br>
from the upper surface of the upper panel 120 to the bottom of the intermediate frame 2, and nuts 150 are combined with ends of the bolts 140.<br>
The upper panel 110 has a rectangular or a square shape, and has a plurality of through holes 111 at every corner.<br>
The drawer 120 has a plurality of grooves 3 formed at the bottom surface thereof. A fixing member 1 is provided to outwardly extend from upper edge portions of the drawer 120. The fixing member 1 has a plurality of insertion holes 11 penetrating therethrough from its upper surface to its lower surface. The insertion holes 11 are formed to correspond to the through holes 111 of the upper panel 110. The fixing member 1 further has an insertion groove 12 on the bottom thereof. In the insertion groove 12, a plurality of fixing protrusions 12a is provided for holding and fixing the intermediate frame 2 in the insertion groove 12 of the fixing member 1. The drawer 120 having a complicated structure described above may be formed by an injection molding method.<br>
The intermediate frame 2 is formed in such a manner as to fit into the insertion groove 12 of the fixing member 1, and has a plurality of connection holes 23 formed to correspond to the insertion holes 11. A hook 23 is provided at the bottom of the intermediate frame 2 between adjacent<br>
6<br><br>
connection holes 23. The stand 130 is combined with the intermediate frame 2 at a rear part of the intermediate frame 2, and a height of the intermediate frame 2 from the ground is adjusted by adjusting a height of the stand 130.<br>
Further, a reinforcement bar 21 is connected between both ends of the intermediate frame 2 by a welding method and it is inserted into the groove 3 provided on the bottom of the drawer 120 when the drawer 120 is combined with the intermediate frame 2.<br>
Accordingly, for assembling the desk, the intermediate frame 2 is inserted into the insertion groove 12 formed on the bottom of the fixing member 1, the bolts 140 are inserted into the respective through holes 140 of the upper panel 110, the respective insertion holes 11 of the fixing member 1 and the respective connection holes 22 of the intermediate frame 2, and the nuts 150 are coupled to an end of respective bolts 140. In the desk in accordance with the present invention, the intermediate frame 2 is fixed to the drawer 120 along three sides of the drawer 120 by bolts and nuts, so that the drawer 120 is more securely fixed to the stand 130 and the upper panel 110, in comparison with the conventional desk.<br>
Fig. 2 is a front view of the desk in accordance with the present invention. Referring to Fig, 2, when the desk is assembled, the intermediate frame 2 is inserted into the<br>
7<br><br>
insertion groove 12 formed on the bottom of the fixing member 1 combined with the drawer 120, and the reinforcement bar 21 is received in the groove {not shown) provided on the bottom of the drawer 120." Further, the upper panel 110 is placed on the upper surface of the drawer 120 to cover the recess 121 of the drawer 120.<br>
Accordingly, when an external impact is applied to the desk or things collide with" the desk, the reinforcement bar 21 prevents the drawer 120 from being deformed and shifted by being received in the groove (not shown) formed on the bottom of the drawer 120.<br>
Fig. 3 is an enlarged view of an A portion in Fig. 2. Referring to Fig. 3, the upper surface of the fixing member 1 is rounded, and the fixing protrusions 12a" are formed in the insertion groove 12 at its both end portions. Since the upper surface of the fixing member 1 is round processed, a contact area of the fixing member to the bottom surface of the upper panel 110 is minimized. Accordingly, when the upper surface of the upper panel 110 is damaged, the upper panel 110 is turned over so that the bottom surface of the upper panel 110 may be used as a working place.<br>
Further, when the intermediate frame 2 is forcibly inserted into the insertion groove 12 made of elastic material, since the fixing protrusions 12a tightly hold the intermediate frame 2 in the insertion groove 12, the drawer<br>
8<br><br>
120 is securely fixed to the stand 130 without using rivets or screws.<br>
As described above, the drawer combined with the fixing member is provided under the upper panel, the intermediate frame is inserted into and fixed in the insertion groove provided on the bottom of the fixing member, the stand is installed on the ground and supports the intermediate frame at both sides, bolts penetrate the upper panel, the fixing member combined with the drawer, and the intermediate frame combined with the stand, and are combined with respective nuts, so that the desk can be assembled without using screws and rivets; so that assembling and disassembling works of- the desk are simpler and easier than the conventional desk. Further, time for the assembling and disassembling works is reduced.<br>
Further, since the upper surface of the fixing member directly contacting to the upper panel is rounded, the contact area between the fixing member combined with the drawer and the bottom surface of the upper panel is minimized. As a result, damage to the bottom surface of the upper panel is minimized, sp that the upper panel may be reused even if the upper surface of the upper panel is damaged, by turning over the upper panel so as for the bottom surface to be used a working place.<br>
Further, since the reinforcement bar is inserted into<br>
9<br><br>
the groove provided on the bottom of the drawer, the drawer is securely assembled with the intermediate frame and the reinforcement bar. As a result, the drawer may not be deformed or swayed when an external impact is applied to the desk.<br>
Although the preferred embodiments of the present invention have been disclosed for illustrative purposes, those skilled in the art will appreciate that various modifications, additions and substitutions are possible, without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention as disclosed in the accompanying claims.<br>
