				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an apparatus and method for retrieving<br>
cable from water during marine operations, particularly systems for deploying<br>
and retrieving electrical and fiber optic cables. Most particularly, the invention<br>
relates to marine seismic cable deployment and retrieval systems for use in<br>
conjunction with a marine vessel.<br>
2.	Brief Description of Relevant Art<br>
In many fields of endeavor, there is an on-going requirement to place<br>
packages of sensing equipment of various types across the earth's surface and<br>
on the seafloor. Such equipment is commonly intended to be used at one<br>
location for a period of time and then transported to a different location for further<br>
use. However, precisely deploying and later retrieving such equipment without<br>
damaging the equipment can be difficult. Operations in water, especially oceans,<br>
bays, and surf zones, can be especially problematic. The equipment commonly<br>
sinks into muddy and sandy sea beds and tends to suffer stress damage when<br>
removed.<br>
Seismic cables can be especially difficult to handle because they are<br>
typically made of multiple components such as electrical conductors, fiber optics,<br>
and stress supporting members all bundled together and covered with a<br>
protective jacketing material. Handling or pulling the cable causes these<br>
components to slip and move with respect to one another. Tension applied to the<br>
outer jacket pulls the jacketing material which then pulls on the inner<br>
components of the cable. This distribution of stresses applies differing stress<br>
values and elongation amounts to the different components of the cable. Even<br><br>
cables where the stress members are embedded into the outer jacket have such<br>
a stress distribution, although to a lesser degree. Propagation of stress through<br>
a cable's components changes and deteriorates the components and<br>
consequently reduces the cable's useful life.<br>
In water, the platform or vessel used to deploy and retrieve the cables<br>
often contributes due to the action of the water. Pulling cable up from a sea<br>
bottom and through sea bottom material is stressful to equipment in the cable,<br>
but simply pulling the cable through water is also stressful. Typically the cable<br>
will be curved in the water, extending downwardly from a platform and curving to<br>
a horizontal position along the sea bottom. The curve's length and shape will<br>
depend on the rate of retrieval, the depth of the water, the amount of cable sunk<br>
into the sea bottom, and the value of the applied pulling tension. The curve of the<br>
cable inevitably causes portions of the cable to be pulled sideways through the<br>
water, creating vortexes in the water, cable strumming, and drag on the cable,<br>
and adding further to the stresses on the cable. Such pulling tensions can<br>
exceed the strength of the cable, causing it to break. Similarly, tensions caused<br>
by pulling of the cable due to heaving of the vessel on ocean waves and swells<br>
can exceed the strength of the cable, causing it to suffer elongation damage and<br>
even break. The cable strength is commonly only a tiny fraction of the applied<br>
forces that potentially may be applied against the cable.<br>
A need exists for apparatus and methods for deploying and recovering<br>
cables that reduce the destructive forces against such cables, particularly when<br>
the cables are distributed along a sea bed or in water.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides an apparatus and method for retrieving<br>
cable from the water during marine operations and is especially advantageous<br>
for use with floating vessels. The invention may be utilized for deploying cable in<br>
marine operations as well.<br>
The present invention provides an apparatus for retrieving cable from<br>
water during marine operations employing a floating vessel, said apparatus<br>
comprising : a distributor for distributing forces across all components of the<br>
cable while pulling said cable ; an adjuster for automatically adjusting the pulling<br>
forces on the cable caused by movement of said vessel in the water: and a<br>
holding area on said vessel for said cable, said holding area comprising a<br>
cylindrical cage whose outside perimeter has vertical slots from a top edge<br>
thereof and whose interior comprises a raceway path and a smaller diameter<br>
cylinder about the central point of said cylindrical cage.<br>
The present invention also provides a method for retrieving cable from<br>
water in marine operations employing a floating vessel, while monitoring and<br>
adjusting the pulling forces on said cable during said retrieval to reduce damage<br>
to said cable from said forces during said retrieval, said method comprising :<br>
pulling said cable with a pulling device that distributes pulling forces and<br>
stresses among all of the cable components, and that employs a see-saw action<br>
for adjusting said pulling forces to maintain said forces below the damage point<br>
for said cable ; and depositing cable in a storage area on said vessel, said<br>
storage area comprising a cylindrical cage having at least two vertical slots and a<br>
central interior cylinder having a conical top and separated from an exterior<br>
cylindrical cage wall by a raceway area for the cable and a conical cap with a<br><br>
protruding arm rotatably mounted on the conical top for receiving and directing<br>
cable into the raceway area.<br>
This invention further provides an apparatus for retrieving and deploying<br>
cable in marine operations, said apparatus comprising :<br>
(a)	pulley drum assembly comprising a pulling drum capable of pulling the<br>
cable while distributing pulling forces across all components of the cable ;<br>
(b)	powered drive motor with regulatable torque drive for operating the pulling<br>
drum and adjusting the forces such pulling exerts on the cable ,<br>
(c)	front-mounted damper arm with an adjustable tension range positioned<br>
prior to the drum pulley assembly to dampen stress on the cable caused<br>
by movement of water;<br>
(d)	storage system for said cable ; and<br>
(e)	means for delivering cable from the pulley drum assembly to the storage<br>
system.<br>
According to the method of the invention, the retrieval of the cable is<br>
conducted while monitoring and adjusting the pulling forces on the cable so as to<br>
reduce or prevent damage to the cable from such forces during the retrieval. A<br>
pulling device that distributes pulling forces and stresses among the cable<br>
components is used to pull the cable for its retrieval. The device may employ a<br>
see-saw action, that is, a pulling and paying back of the cable, to maintain the<br>
forces below the damage point for the cable.<br>
A preferred embodiment comprises a pulling drum capable of pulling the<br>
cable by wrapping the cable around the drum, thereby distributing pulling forces<br>
across the components of the cable. The pulling drum may be powered by a<br>
drive motor with a regulatable torque drive for adjusting the forces on the cable.<br><br>
Alternatively, the drum may be powered by a clutching system or by a hydraulic<br>
torque conversion system set to slip or stall at a selectable force value. Any<br>
means for powering the drum may preferably allow payback of the cable to<br>
lessen forces on the cable if needed to avoid damage to the cable. Preferably<br>
the apparatus or system will also have a front-mounted damper arm with an<br>
adjustable tension range positioned in front of the pulling drum to dampen stress<br>
on the cable, particularly stress caused by the movement of the water<br>
The retrieved cable is preferably stored in a storage area that will avoid<br>
tangling or twisting of the cable. The storage area preferably includes a cage<br>
within which the cable is stored, with the attachments preferably positioned or<br>
stored on the outside of the cage.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
According to the invention, a pulling device is provided<br>
that	allows cable to be	retrieved from water and sea<br>
beds without damage or fouling from	the pulling process<br><br>
to either the cable components or attachments to the cable, even though such<br>
attachments may be wider than the cable itself. Cable components may include, for<br>
example, internal stress members, protective jackets, electrical and fiber optic<br>
conductors and insulating layers. Attachments to the cable may include, for example,<br>
sensor packages and other electrical or fiber optic equipment.<br>
[0019]	The pulling device distributes pulling forces and stresses among preferably all<br>
of the cable components, most preferably substantially equally among all of the cable<br>
components, including internal stress members of the cable and external jacketing<br>
material.<br>
[0020]	In a preferred embodiment, referring to Figures 1(a) and 1(b), the pulling<br>
device comprises a pulling drum 10, rotatably mounted on a preferably firm, stationary<br>
or relatively level or horizontal mounting base plate 12, which is typically affixed to a<br>
platform or marine vessel 38, as shown in FIG 3. As the pulling drum 10 is rotated,<br>
the cable 20 is pulled up to accomplish the cable retrieval process. Sufficient<br>
compressional forces to distribute pulling forces among all the cable components, and<br>
sufficient frictional forces to retrieve the cable 20, can normally be achieved by<br>
wrapping the cable 20 around drum 10 less than a full circumference, as shown in<br>
FIGS 1(a) and 1(b), although cable 20 may be wrapped around drum 10 a plurality of<br>
times. Because of the compressive force between the pulling drum 10 and the cable<br>
20, the pulling forces on the cable will be transmitted internally within the cable to<br>
each component of the cable, thereby substantially equalizing the pulling forces on<br>
each component of the cable. Drive torque may be applied to the drum 10 by any<br>
available means known to those of ordinary skill in the art, such as electric motor,<br>
shown schematically in FIG. 1(c), or hydraulic, or mechanical means, for example.<br>
The cable tension may be monitored by monitoring the position of the damper arm or<br><br>
the drive power applied to the drum, and the drive torque applied to the drum 10<br>
regulated in response to the measured tension to control the force on the cable 20.<br>
Alternatively, the drive torque may be regulated or adjusted through a clutching system<br>
or hydraulic torque conversion system 59, shown schematically in FIG. 1 (c), that may<br>
be set to slip or stall at a selected force value (i.e., an amount of force that should<br>
preferably not be exceeded to ensure no damage to the cable, most preferably with a<br>
margin for error built into the value). As shown in FIG. 1(c), clutching or hydraulic<br>
conversion system 59 comprises motor 54 which applies power to drum 10 through<br>
clutch or torque converter 56. The drive torque may be set to stall at a selected force<br>
by drive torque control 58. In either case, if the tension or force on the cable 20<br>
continues to exceed the selected force amount, the drive torque means will stall so that<br>
drum 10 will initially discontinue forward rotation, and if stalling is not sufficient to<br>
prevent further increases in the tension on the cable, the system will allow drum 10 to<br>
rotate in the reverse direction, and the cable 20 to pay back out to lessen the tension or<br>
force on the cable 20. As the extreme tensions relax, the system will resume retrieval<br>
of the cable, i.e., the drum 10 will resume forward rotation. The swing of the damper<br>
arm also functions to limit tension. In very high wave action, the alternate pulling in<br>
and playing out of the cable according to the invention to prevent the maximum<br>
applied tensions from being exceeded can produce a "see-saw" action.<br>
[0021]	Referring again to Figures 1(a) and (b), in a preferred embodiment of the<br>
invention, a front mounted damper arm 30 is positioned in front of the pulling drum 10<br>
and preferably substantially at the entry point of the cable from the water onto the<br>
retrieval vehicle, which may be a boat or other floating vessel or platform. The<br>
damper arm 30 performs a dampening function, to compensate for vessel movement, to<br>
keep the tension on the cable 20 within a consistent range. With increasing pull force,<br><br>
the damper arm 30 will tilt downwardly, to reduce or counteract the increasing tension<br>
in the cable. The tension forces required to pull the damper arm 30 down increases<br>
with the arm's travel distance. The tension range of damper arm 30 is preferably<br>
adjustable so as to handle an assortment of cable tension requirements within the mid<br>
point of the arm travel. Shock absorber 34, extending between damper arm 30 and<br>
mast 36, and shock absorber 26, extending between damper arm 30 and base plate 12<br>
(or vessel 38) function to substantially isolate cable 20 from sudden vessel movements.<br>
Mast 36 may be attached to mounting base plate 12 or vessel 38, by standard<br>
mounting means known to those of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
[0022]	The damper arm 30 is preferably mounted so that the damper arm 30 can<br>
rotate about a rotation point 32 on mounting base 28, which is also rotationally<br>
mounted on base plate 12 so that mounting base 28 can swivel horizontally.<br>
Accordingly, damper arm 30 can provide a "following" action with respect to the cable<br>
20. That is, the damper arm 30 preferably moves or swivels as the floating vessel<br>
containing the damper arm 30 drifts in the water due to wind and water current forces,<br>
so that the damper arm points in directional alignment with the deployed cable 20. The<br>
damper arm 30 also preferably contains alignment; devices comprising rollers or<br>
sheaves 22 and 24 to align any attachments or components attached to the cable with<br>
the cable to aid the cable's passage through the roller system comprising drums (or<br>
sheaves) 10 and 70.<br>
[0023]	A preferred embodiment of the invention further provides a storage system for<br>
the retrieved cable (or for the cable prior to deployment). In one embodiment, the<br>
storage system provides for the storage of the cable and any attachments to the cable in<br>
a holding area, preferably or typically including a cage, with the attachments<br>
preferably positioned or stored on the outside of the cage, for easy access if desired or<br><br>
needed, with the cable storage being controlled so as to prevent fouling and tangling of<br>
the cable and attachments with one another.<br>
[0024]	Referring to Figures 2(a), 2(b) and 2(c) for a preferred embodiment of such a<br>
storage system, in which Figure 2(a) is an assembled view, Figure 2(b) is a side view<br>
and Figure 2(c) is a top view. The storage system comprises a cage 40, preferably<br>
substantially circular or oval, whose outside perimeter 42 has a plurality of vertical<br>
slots 41 extending from the top edge of outside perimeter 42 at least part way down the<br>
side of cage 40 so that the cable 20 may exit the cage through one slot 41 and re-enter<br>
at another such slot. The slots enable a cable with one or more attachments 7 (as<br>
shown in Figure 3) to be brought outside the cage 40 at the approximate location of the<br>
attachment so that the attachment may be positioned or hung on the outside of the cage<br>
40 and the cable then returned or allowed to re-enter the cage for continuation of the<br>
cable storage process.<br>
[0325]	Inside cage 40 is another smaller cage 50, preferably also circular or oval, and<br>
preferably centered on the same point as the cage 40, so that a raceway area or path 46,<br>
shown more clearly in FIG. 2(c), is formed between outside perimeter 42 of cage 40<br>
and cage 50. The top of cage 50 is preferably a cone 51 having a base or bottom<br>
perimeter preferably substantially coextensive with the perimeter of cage 50. This<br>
conical shape facilitates storage of the cable 20 by enabling the cable that is being<br>
stored to slide down the cone 51 into the raceway area 46. Attached to the top of cone<br>
51 is another, smaller cone, 53, preferably rotatably mounted on cone 51 and attached<br>
or associated with a drive motor so that cone 53 can rotate on its central axis about the<br>
top of cone 51. An arm 60 preferably protrudes from the cone 53 and is preferably<br>
attached to cone 53 so that said arm 60 rotates with cone 53 to sweep around above<br>
cone 51 to catch and move any suspended cable toward the cone 53 so that the cable<br><br>
will be directed and deposited in the raceway area 46. Most preferably, the cable will<br>
be deposited in layers in raceway area 46.<br>
[0026]	As shown more clearly in Figure 3, as cable 20 is being retrieved, cable 20<br>
travels from drum 10 and around powered guide roller 70, from which cable 20 is<br>
allowed to fall toward smaller cone 53. Cable 20 is caught by guide arm 60, which<br>
sweeps cable 20 around smaller cone 53 and cone 51, so that cable 20 slides down<br>
cone 51 and is deposited in a circular pattern within raceway 46 between outer cage 40<br>
and inner cage 50. Guide roller 70 is supported above small cone 53 by support arm<br>
62, as illustrated in a first side view in Figure 2(b) and in a second side view<br>
(orthogonal to the first side view) in Figure 2(d). Support arm 62 is supported from<br>
mounting base plate 12 or vessel 38, by any ordinary means known to those of<br>
ordinary skill in the art.<br>
[0027]	In an alternative embodiment, arm 60 might have its own means for rotation<br>
and be independent of any rotation of cone 53. In such embodiment, arm 60 would not<br>
be attached directly to cone 53.<br>
[0328]	Referring to Figure 3, guide roller 70, comprising a powered drum, preferably<br>
delivers the cable 20 from the pulling drum 10 and deposits the cable 20 vertically<br>
above the peak of the cone 53 so that the rotating arm 60 will cause the cable 20 to be<br>
deposited around the cage 50 in raceway 46. Depositing the cable 20 in this manner<br>
allows the cable to lie down unstressed and to be deployed back out of the cage 40 in<br>
the same manner and direction so as not to impart any residing twist into the cable<br>
when so deployed. Thus, when the cable is pulled back out of the storage area, the<br>
cable has no twist stresses that need to be removed during the re-deployment.<br>
[0029]	Preferably, the opening between cages 40 and 50 to raceway 46 will be<br>
sufficiently narrow to inhibit the entry into raceway (pathway) 46 of any attachments<br><br>
7 on cable 20. Preferably, perimeter wall 42 will have a lip 44 extending from the wall<br>
42 which, in combination with the edge of cone 51, will serve to catch or stop the entry<br>
of attachments 7 into raceway 46. Most preferably, such attachments 7 will bridge the<br>
entry space into raceway 46 and the cable will be directed by lip 44 into raceway 46<br>
while the attachments remain held above the raceway 46. The attachments 7 may then<br>
be automatically or manually pulled to the outside of perimeter wall 42 where they will<br>
preferably be positioned in a holding bracket (not shown). Preferably, a portion of<br>
cable 20 associated with the attachment 7 will be pulled through a slot 41 to the outside<br>
of perimeter wall 42, along with the attachment. After the attachment 7 is positioned<br>
outside the perimeter wall 42, the associated cable may be returned manually or<br>
automatically to pathway 46 via another slot 41. That is, the cable exits from the<br>
raceway 46 with the attachment 7 via a slot 41, and returns back into raceway 46 by<br>
way of another slot 41.<br>
[0030]	Referring to Figure 4, the cable 20 may be redeployed from storage cage 40<br>
into the sea by running the cable from the raceway 46, up and out of the raceway 46,<br>
back up and along cone 53 and over the drum 70, which may now be set or used in<br>
either a freewheel or a powered mode. The cable may then be passed over any other<br>
required supporting drums until reaching the area for deployment into the water.<br>
[0031]	Often for re-deployment, the weight of the cable and its drag in the water are<br>
sufficient forces to pull the cable out of the raceway 46 and over the side of a floating<br>
vessel transporting the cable. When such weight is not enough to effect the re-<br>
deployment or it is desired to deliver excess cable into the water faster than can be<br>
achieved by the vessel's forward speed alone, the drum or roller 70 may be powered to<br>
pull the cable up and out of raceway 46.<br><br>
[0032]	The foregoing description of the invention is intended to be a description of<br>

apparatuses and methods may be made without departing from the intended scope of<br>
