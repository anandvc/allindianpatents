Thus, the use of the compound::; of the present Invention for the first time enables industrially production of Compound I. BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
The process of the present invention, which enables industrial scale product-ion of Compound 1, is carried out as follows (See also Scheme; .1 ) : Ethyl<br>
3- [4 ( 3-ben/.yloxyphenylthio) -2-chlorophenyl] acrylate is reduced using bismuth trichloride and sodium borohydride.  The reduced<br>
product is turtner reduced using potassium borohydride and lithium chloride. The resulting alcohol derivative is mesylatedby reacting with methanesulfonyl chloride. The mesylated product is iodinated with sodium iodide and then reacted with sodium nitrite to form i-benzy.ioxy-3- ( 3-chloro-4- ( 3-nitropropyl) phenylthio] benzene . This product is reacted with formaldehyde in the presence of a base to form<br>
2- [2- [4- ( 3-benzyloxyphenylthio)-2-chlorophenyl]ethyl]-2-nitro-1,3-propanediol. Reducing this compound with palladium hydroxide-carbon gives Compound I.  <br><br>
