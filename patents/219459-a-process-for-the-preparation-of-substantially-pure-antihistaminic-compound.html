SUBSTANTIALLY PURE ANTIHISTAMINE COMPOUND<br>
SUN   PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRIES LTD.<br>
A company incorporated under the laws of India having their office at ACME PLAZA, ANDHERI-KURLA ROAD, ANDHERI (E), MUMBAI-400059, MAHARASHTRA, INDIA.<br>
The  following  specification  particularly  describes  and  ascertains  the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
SUBSTANTIALLY PURE ANTIHISTAMINE COMPOUND<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The present invention relates to substantially pure desloratadine, a compound of formula 1, and a process of preparation thereof. Desloratadine, 8-chloro-6,l 1-dihydro-l l-(4-piperidinylidene)-5H-benzo[5,6]cyclohepta[l,2-b]pyridine, is an antihistaminic agent useful in the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis.<br><br>
H <br>
Formula 1<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The PCT publication WO 8503707 (hereinafter referred to as the '707 application, equivalent of which is the United States Patent No. 4,659,716, Indian reference not available) claims desloratadine and exemplifies the process of its preparation by alkaline hydrolysis of loratadine (formula 2, scheme 1), followed by treatment with acetic acid to give the acetate salt of desloratadine, and then converting the acetate into the free base of desloratadine. However, the '707 application does not disclose the purity levels of desloratadine or its impurity profile.<br>

Formula 1<br>
Formula 2<br>
The PCT publication WO 9901450 (equivalent of which is the United States Patent No. 6,506,767, Indian reference not available) discloses the polymorphic forms 1 and 2 of desloratadine. Preparation of the polymorphic forms 1 and 2 is disclosed by employing alkaline hydrolysis of loratadine by a process similar to that described in the '707 application, and then crystallization from methyl isobutyl ketone, hexanol, methanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol, cyclohexanol, chlorinated solvents such as dichloromethane, ethyl acetate and ether solvents such as dioxane, di-isopropylether, di-n-butyl ether. However, WO 9901450 too does not disclose the purity levels of desloratadine or its impurity profile.<br>
The PCT application WO 02/42290 (Indian reference not available) claims acid addition salts of desloratadine namely, monoacid, hemi acid and diced salts. It discloses a process for preparation of diacid salts by reacting loratadine with concentrated mineral acids. It also teaches a process for conversion of diacid salts to monoacid or hemi acid salts by treatment with a solution of a base. It provides new desloratadine hemisulfate salt which is prepared from desloratadine disulfate salt with High Performance Liquid Chromatography (referred to as HPLC herein) purity greater than 99.5% by treatment with a solution of aqueous ammonia.<br>
We have found that desloratadine when prepared according to the prior art processes shows a HPLC peak for an impurity at a relative retention time in the range from about 0.85 to about 0.99 (with respect to desloratadine), which is greater than the discard limit set at less than 0.025% of the total area, when tested according to an HPLC method<br>

The reaction mass was cooled to ambient temperature and quenched into ice cold water (300ml). The pH of the quenched mass was adjusted to pH 4.0 to 5.0 with liquor ammonia and charcoalized (5g decolorizing charcoal). The pH of the charcoalized solution was adjusted to &gt; 9.5 with liquor ammonia, and sticky semi-solid mass which separated was extracted into toluene (700ml). The toluene extract was concentrated under reduced pressure at below 65° C and degassed to obtain an off-white to white solid of desloratadine (yield 78.0 g, 96%, purity &gt; 99.0%). HPLC analysis of the sample (as per the procedure described in example 2) did not show any peak due to impurity at relative retention time of 0.85 to 0.99 (relative to desloratadine peak).<br>
The product obtained as above was dissolved in cyclohexane-methanol mixture (14:1, 750ml) at 60-65° C, concentrated solution (to 550ml) at atmospheric pressure and then cooled gradually to 10-15° C. Digested for 2 hrs at 10-15° C, filtered, and dried at 50-55° C to obtain 8-chloro-ll-piperidin-4-ylidene-6,ll-dihydro-5H-benzo[5,6]cyclohepta[l,2-bjpyridine (desloratadine) (73g , overall 90.0 % yield, purity 99.92 %.

Example 3<br>
Loratadine hydrolysis by non-mineral acid<br>

The reaction mass was cooled to ambient temperature, quenched into water (300ml) and the resulting solution heated at 90-100° C for 1 hour. The reaction mixture was cooled to ambient temperature and extracted once with toluene (100ml). The pH of the aqueous layer was adjusted between 4.0 to 5.0 with liquor ammonia and charcoalized (2.5g decolorizing charcoal). The pH of the charcoalized solution was adjusted to &gt; 9.5 with liquor ammonia, and the sticky semi-solid mass which separated was extracted into toluene (300ml).

12<br><br>
example 2. The chromatogram showed desloratadine at a retention time of 24.33 minutes, and an impurity at a relative retention time of 0.91 amounting to 0.12%.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

ABSTRACT<br>
The present invention provides substantially pure desloratadine having an HPLC purity greater than 99.5% and having an absorbance less than 0.15 Au at 420 nm for a 5%w/v solution in methanol, which does not show a peak for an impurity at a relative retention time in the range from about 0.85 to about 0.99 (relative to desloratadine appearing at a retention time of 25+5 minutes), which is greater than the discard limit set at less than 0.025% of the total area, when tested according to an HPLC method performed using a Hypersil BDS Cg column (15cm x 4.6mm, 5 um particle size) with the following parameters:<br><br>
Mobile phase<br>
Injection volume Flow rate Run time Discard limit<br><br>
:   Buffer  solution  having  a pH  of about  3,  methanol  and acetonitrile in a volume ratio of 8:1:1.<br>
20ml<br>
1.5 ml/minute<br>
75 minutes.<br>
Set at less than 0.025% of total area<br><br>
Formula 3<br>
The present invention also provides a process for the preparation of substantially pure desloratadine by the process comprising acidic hydrolysis of a compound of formula 3 where R is selected from COR1, COOR1 wherein R\ is selected from branched or linear alkyl (1-6 C), cycloalkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, aryl, aralkyl and their substituted analogs; and their substituted analogs with a strong organic acid or a mineral acid..<br><br>
