				<td>This invention relates to an improved process for production of aluminium dry cell.<br>
The invention can be used to produce aluminium dry cells for use in flash lights, electronic equipment such as transistor radios, tape players, millimeters, clocks, toys.<br>
The art and technology of production of zinc dry cells is well established. It consists of zinc metal shell as<br>
galvanic anode and MnO   as cathode separated by  permeable<br>
2<br>
starch  layer or paper.  Controlled oxidation  of  zinc   is<br>
accomplished according to reaction as given below<br>
++ Zn  â€”&gt;  Zn      + 2e<br>
and  the  oxidant MnO   aided by  the  electrolytes   like<br>
2<br>
ammonium chloride mixed with MnO  provides  the   electrical<br>
2<br>
energy. Zinc metal shell anode accounts for 30% of the total raw material for manufacture of of zinc dry cells. For a thousand million pieces approximately 12000 ton of zinc metal are required.<br>
It would be advantageous to use commonly available commercially pure aluminium metal shells galvanic anodes as aluminium is not only cheaper but also much superior to zinc, both on coulombic and energy basis. The excellent storability, formability, abundant availability and rather inexpensive virtues are additional advantages. On a coulombic basis 9.0 gm. of aluminium is equivalent to 33.0 gin. of zinc and the Gibb's free energy released per mole of<br><br>
electrons exchanged is 161.0 kJ and 73.3 kJ for aluminium and zinc respectively.<br>
A number of patents have been taken throughout the world for production of aluminium dry cells but none so far with commonly available commercially pure aluminium. The problems of using aluminium as a galvanic anode are due to its reactive nature towards alkali or acid alike and its passivation characteristic in neutral medium. On dissolution of the passive film Aluminium, (standard electrode potential (SEP) -1.67 V) is very active and prone to self corrosion in aqueous medium.<br>
Previous developments require specially developed duplex/composite alloys or aluminium alloyed with zinc, tin, antimony, bismuth to inhibit the self corrosion. Simultaneously some inhibiting agents like chromates and dichromates, chromium chloride or salts of ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid (EDTA) and activating agents like chlorides of mercury, sodium were included in the electrolyte mix to enhance the life of the aluminium dry cells.<br>
G. S. Lozier and R. Glicksman in their U. S. patent no. 2874079 disclosed use of anodes with duplex layer, having an outer layer comprising an alloy with composition 95.5% Al, 3% Mg, 1% Zn and 0.5% Mg; and an internal layer of super purity aluminium which comprised of 70% by weight of duplex product. The cathode was an organic oxidizing agent in which the oxidizing properties were due to positively<br><br>
charged halogen atoms. The electrolyte was hydrated aluminium chloride and chromic chloride which also contained other metal chlorides but their purpose is not clarified. the open circuit voltage (OCV) of the cell was 1.5V and discharge life of 350 minutes to 0.9V.<br>
J. J. Stokes Jr. in his U. S. patents nos. 2796456 and 3307976 used duplex aluminium alloy container the inner part constituting 70% of the anode was ultra pure aluminium and the outer layer constituting 30% of the anode was alloyed with a metal such that the outer layer was less anodic than the inner layer. The bulk electrolyte aluminium chloride contained chromium chloride and or ammonium chromate as inhibiting agent ammonium chloride was added to achieve the best results. The capacity of these cells was between 790 and 795 minutes discharge time (to 0.9 V) and an average shelf life of less than three years (retaining 75% of the initial value).<br>
J. Foucry in his U. S. patent no. 3415688 used super purity aluminium shell as anode and electrolyte was ammonium chloride containing mercuric chloride as accelerator and salts of ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid (EDTA) or ethanolamine prepared by neutralizing fluoboric acid as complexing agent. The cathode was a very porous graphite rod charged with PbO deposited by electrolysis.<br>
Michel Angelo, V. Debanathan, B. A. Shenoi, P. L. Joseph and V. Subramaniam in their Indian patent no. 106324<br><br>
used aluminium metal with electrolyte manganese chloride containing mercuric chloride or aluminum amalgamated with mercury when the electrolyte contained no mercuric chloride. The electrolyte also contained complexing agents like citrates, tartrates or EDTA. The OCV of cells with mercuric chloride in the electrolyte was 1.7 to 1.9 V; and those with no mercuric chloride in the electrolyte was 1.5 V. Data regarding other tests is not documented in the patent.<br>
P. L. Joseph, V. Subramaniam, G. Jothinathan, B. A. Shenoi, M. Angelo and V. Debanathan in their Indian patent No. 106324 used Al-Hg alloy anode shells and MnCl with alkyl pyredinium halide. With unamalgamated anode mercuric salt was added to the electrolyte. They also used Al-Hg-Sn alloy for making anode shells. The OCV ranged from 1.5 to 1.8 V. No information regarding other tests are documented.<br>
The known process using aluminium anode as mentioned above have the following drawbacks.<br>
1)	Pronounced self corrosion when the cell is either idle  or<br>
active.<br>
2)	Requirement  of  specially developed   duplex/composite<br>
alloys  or  super quality aluminium to  combat the  self<br>
corrosion. These are not only costly but also unavailable<br>
commercially upsetting the  advantages  of aluminium  dry<br>
cells.<br><br>
3) The use of corrosive and poisonous electrolytes e.g. chlorides of aluminium, manganese, sodium, ammonium, or mercury with different inhibiting agents like salts of chromates dichromates or EDTA. These electrolytes are poisonous and very corrosive to the duplex/composite special alloys, not to speak of the commonly available commercially pure aluminium shells.<br>
Successful functioning of a dry cell with aluminium anode is contingent upon:<br>
a)	High degree of inhibition of  self  corrosion when  the<br>
cell is idle and in action.<br>
b)	Large delivery of current  at  a  practicable  operating<br>
voltage when the cell is in action.<br>
There are two modes of approach to achieve these twin objectives.<br>
The first is to use aluminium alloyed with elements like zinc, tin, manganese, indium, gallium, thallium, bismuth followed by special heat treatments or to use duplex/composite alloys.<br>
The second is to find out an electrolyte such that, commonly available commercially pure aluminium having 99.9% purity can also be used to produce stable dry cells, comparable to commercially available zinc dry cells.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the production of aluminium dry cells by overcoming the above mentioned drawbacks.<br><br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the production of aluminium dry cell using a novel electrolyte possessing a perfect balance of the inhibiting and activating properties expedient for the purpose.<br>
The present is based on our findings that chlorides of alkaline earth metal, such as calcium chloride can be used as the electrolyte due to its excellent balance of inhibiting and activating properties, when the cell is at rest or in action respectively.<br>
The appropriate inhibiting property of calcium chloride may be due to the physically adsorbed chloride molecules on the aluminium shell with the positively charged calcium ions disposed towards anode shell. This protects the aluminum shell from self corrosion in all conditions. It has also been found that along with the AEM chlorides complexing agents like 2-Hydroxy propane-1,2,3, tricarboxyllic acid and inhibitors like dichromates of sodium, potassium or ammonium in small proportions below 5% can be added to enhance the inhibiting action to combat corrosion with no adverse effect on the performance of the improved aluminium dry cells.<br>
It was also found that other alkaline earth metal chloride chloride can be used along with aluminium chloride in appropriate proportions when consistency of the cathode mix is hard to prevent the cell from corrosion.<br>
It was also found that other activators like aluminium fluoride ammonium per chlorate in traces ~ 0.1% have a<br><br>
Beneficial effect on the performance of the cell in terms of continuous current voltage (CCV) and current.<br>
The proportion of water has an important bearing on the corrosion behavior and the performance of the cell. Below a certain minimum the activity of the cell is impaired badly where as beyond a certain maximum the corrosion is fast and the cells are punctured.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides an improved process for the production of aluminum dry cells which comprises:<br>
a)	preparation of standard size aluminum metal shell,<br>
b)	characterised in that lining the inside of the said aluminum shell with an<br>
ionically permeable material such as herein described    and lining the<br>
bottom with an insulating paper,<br>
c)	filling a cathode mix having a composition such as herein described, inside<br>
the permeable lining with a graphite/carbon rod, having metal cap, in the<br>
centre of the said shell,<br>
d)	covering the top of the said cathode mix by a cardboard through which<br>
the said graphite/carbon rod passes,<br>
e)	sealing the said shell at the top with wax.<br>
According to an embodiment of the invention ;<br>
The aluminum shell may be made of commercially pure aluminum having purity -<br>
99.9%<br>
The manganese dioxide may be of electrolytic grade or any other grade which is<br>
battery active or mixture of several grades having battery activity<br>
The graphite rod having metal cap can be any other non reacting material having good electrical conductivity such as commonly used for dry cells<br><br>
The insulating paper lining at the bottom may be a strong enough waxed paper<br>
The card board covering the cathode mix at the top may be a card board normally used for such purpose<br>
The sealing wax may be pitch or any other material used normally for such purpose<br>
By the process of present invention aluminum dry cells were produced having properties as given in table 1 below<br><br>
