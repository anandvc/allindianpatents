In order to best understand the improvement of the invention, PIGS, I and 2 illustrate several prior art raefliods and systems. These systems will first be reviewed, and then me invention will be described in terms of the preferred embodiment examples of FIGS. 3-7A and 7B. In prior art optical tweezer system 10 of FIG. 1, optical gradient forces arise from use of a single beam of light 12 to controllably manipulate a small dielectric particle 14 dispersed in a medium 16 whose index of refraction, n», is smaller than mat of toe particle 14. The nature of toe optical gradient farces is well known, and also it is well understood that the principle has been generalized to allow manipulation of reflecting, absorbing and low dielectric constant particles as well. Any of these techniques can be implemented in the context of the invention described hereinafter and will be encompassed by use of the terminology optical tweezer, optical trap and optical gradient force trap hereinafter.<br>
The optical tweezer system 10 is applied by using a light beam 12 (such as a laser beam) capable of applying the necessary forces needed to carry out the optical trapping effect needed to manipulate a particle. The objective of a conventional form of the optical tweezer 10 is to project one or more shaped beams of light into the center of a back aperture 24 of a converging optical element (such as an objective lens 20). As noted in FIG. 1 me light beam 12 has a width "w" and having an input angle 0 relative to an optical axis 22. The light beam 12 is input to aback aperture 24 of the objective lens 20 and output from a front aperture 26 substantially converging to a focal point 28 in focal plane 30 of imaging volume 32 with the focal point 28 coinciding with an optical trap 33. In general, any focusing optical system can form the basis for the optical tweezer system 10.<br>
hi the case of die light beam 12 being a collimated laser beam and having its axis coincident with tie optical axis 22, the tight beam 12 enters die back aperture 24 of the objective lens 20 and is brought to a focus in the imaging volume 32 at the center point c of the objective lens focal plane 30. When the axis of the light beam 12 is displaced by the angle 0 with respect to the optical axis 22, beam axis 31 and the optical axis 22 coincide at me center point B of the back aperture 12. This displacement enables translation Df the optical trap across the field of view by an amount mat depends on the angular magnification of the objective lens 20. The two variables, angular displacement 0 and<br><br><br>
varying convergence of the tight beam 12, can be used to form the optical trap at selected positions within the imaging volume 32. A multiple number of me optical traps 33 can he arranged in different locations provided that multiple beams of light 12 are applied to the back aperture 24 at the different angles 0 and with differing degrees of coUimation.<br>
In order to carry out optical trapping in three dimensions, optical gradient forces created on me particle to be trapped must exceed odwr radiation pressures arising from light scattering and absorption. In general mis necessitates having me wave front of the light beam 12 to have an appropriate shape at the hack aperture 24. For example, for a Gaussian TEMoo input laser beam, the beam diameter w should substantially coincide with the diameter of the back aperture 24. For more general beam profiles (such as Gauss-Laguerre) comparable conditions can be formulated.<br>
In another prior art system in FIG. 2, the optical tweezer system 10 can translate the optical trap 33 across the field of view of the objective lens 20. A telescope 34 is constructed of lenses LI and L2 which establishes a point A which is optically conjugate to the center point Bin the prior art system of FIG. 1. In die system of FIG. 2 the light beam 12 passing through the point A also passes through the point B and thus meets the basic requirements for performing as me optical tweezer system 10. Hie degree of collimation is preserved by positioning die lenses LI and L2 as shown in FIG. 2 to optimize the transfer properties of the telescope 34. In addition, the magnification of the telescope 34 can be chosen to optimize angular displacement of the light beam 12 and its width via the plane of the back aperture 24 of (lie objective lens 20. As stated hereinbefore, in general several of the light beams 12 can be used to form several associated optical traps. Such multiple beams 12 can be created from multiple independent input beams or from a single beam manipulated by conventional reflective and/or refractive optical elements.<br>
m one preferred embodiment of the invention shown in FIG. 3, arbitrary arrays of optical traps can be formed. A diffractive optical element 40 is disposed substantially in a plane 42 conjugate to back aperture 24 of the objective lens 20. Note that only a single diffracted output beam 44 is shown for clarity, but it should be understood that a plurality of such beams 44 can be created by the diffractive optical element40. The input light beam 12 incident on tite diffractive optical element 40 is split into a pattern of the output beam 44 characteristic of the nature of the dif&amp;active optical element 40, each of which<br><br><br>
emanates from the point A. Thus the output beams 44 also pass through the point B as a consequence of the downstream optical elements described hereinbefore.<br>
The diffractive optical element 40 of FIG, 3 is shown as being normal to the input light beam 12, but many other arrangements are possible. For example, in Fig. 4 the light beam 12 arrives at an oblique angle p relative to the optic axis 22 and not at a normal to the diffractive optical element 40. In this embodiment, the diffracted beams 44 emanating from point A will form optical traps 50 in focal plane 52 of the imaging volume 32 (seen best in FIG. I). In this arrangement of the optical tweezer system 10 an undiffracted portion 54 of the input light beam 12 can be removed from the optical tweezer system 10. This configuration thus enables processing less background light and improves efficiency and effectiveness of forming optical traps.<br>
The diffractive optical element 40 can include computer generated holograms which split the input Hght beam 12 into a preselected desired partem. Combining such holograms with the remainder of the optical elements in FIGS. 3 and 4 enables creation of arbitrary arrays in which the diffractive optical element 40 is used to shape the wavefront of each diffracted beam independently. Therefore, the optical traps 50 can be disposed not only in the focal plane 52 of the objective lens 20, but also out of the focal plane 52 to form a three-dimensional arrangement of the optical traps 50. In addition, a device for activation/deactivation of the diffractive optical element 40 is a means for selectively blocking at least one of the plurality of laser beams.<br>
9<br><br>
In the optical tweezer system 10 of FIGS. 3 and 4, also included is a focusing optical element, such as the objective lens 20 (or other like functionally equivalent optical device, such as a Fresnel lens) to converge the diffracted beam 44 to form the optical traps 50. Further, the telescope 34, or other equivalent transfer optics, creates a point A conjugate to the center point B of the previous back aperture 24. The diffractive optical element 40 is placed in a plane containing point A.<br>
In another form of the invention, arbitrary arrays of the optical traps 50 can be created without use of the telescope 34. In such an embodiment the diffractive optical element 40 can be placed directly in the plane containing point B.<br>
In the optical tweezer system 10 either static or time dependent diffractive optical elements 40 can be used. For a dynamic, or time dependent version, one can create time changing arrays of the optical traps 50 which can be part of a system utilizing such a feature. In addition, these dynamic optical elements 40 can be used to actively move particles and matrix media relative to one another. For example, the diffractive optical<br>
10<br><br>
element 40 can be a liquid crystal phase array undergoing changes imprinted with computer-generated holographic patterns.<br>
In another embodiment illustrated in FIG. 5, a system can be constructed to cany out continuous translation ofthe optical tweezer trap 50. A gunbal mounted mirror 60 iB placed with its center of rotation at point A. The light beam 12 is incident on the surface of the mirror 60 and has its axis passing through point A and will be projected to the back aperture 24. Tilting of the mirror 60 causes a change of the angle of incidence of me light beam 12 relative to the mirror 60, and this feature can be used to translate the resulting optical trap 50. A second telescope 62 is formed from lenses L3 and L4 which creates a point A' which is conjugate to point A. The diffractive optical element 40 placed at point A1 now creates a pattern of diffracted beams 64, each of which passes through point A to form one of the tweezer traps 50 in an array of the optical tweezers system 10.<br>
In operation of the embodiment of FIG. 5, the mirror 60 translates the entire tweezer array as a unit. This methodology is useful for precisely aligning me optical tweezer array with a stationary substrate to dynamically stiffen the optical trap 50 through small-amplitude rapid oscillatory displacements, as well as for any application requiring a general translation capability.<br>
The array ofthe optical traps 50 also can be translated vertically relative to the sample stage (not shown) by moving the sample stage or by adjusting the telescope 34. In addition, the optical tweezer array can also be translated laterally relative to the sample by moving the sample stage. This feature would be particularly useful for large scale movement beyond the range of the objective lens field of view.<br>
In another form of the invention shown in FIG. 6 the optical system is arranged to permit viewing images of particles trapped by the optical tweezers 10. A dichroic beamsplitter 70, or other equivalent optical beamsplitter, is inserted between the objective lens 20 and the optical train of the optical tweezer system 10. hi the illustrated embodiment the beamsplitter 70 selectively reflects the wavelength of light used to form the optical tweezer array and transmits other wavelengths. Thus, the light beam 12 used to form the optica) traps 50 is transmitted to the back aperture 24 with high efficiency while light beam 66 used to form images can pass through to imaging optics (not shown).<br>
An illustration of an application of the invention is shown in FIGS. 7A and 7B. The diffractive optical element 40 is designed to interact with the single light beam 12 to<br><br><br>
create a 4x4 array of collimated beams. A lOOmW frequency doubled diode-pumped Nd:YAG laser operating at 532 nm provides a Gaussian TEMoo form for the light beam 12. In FIG. 7A the field of view is illuminated in part by laser light backscattered by sixteen silica spheres trapped in the array's sixteen primary optical tweezers 10. The lum diameter spheres are dispersed in water and placed in a sample volume between a glass microscope slide and a 170um thick glass coverslip. The tweezer array is projected upward through the coverslip and is positioned in a plane 8um above the coverslip and more than 20um below the upper microscope slide. The silica spheres are stably trapped in three-dimensions in each of the sixteen optical tweezers 10.<br>
In FIG. 7B is shown the optically-organized arrangement of spheres 1/30 second after the optical tweezers 10 (traps) were extinguished but before the spheres had time to diffuse away from the trap site.<br>
Adaptive Tweezer Mode<br>
In other forms of the invention the basic optical trap embodiment described hereinbefore can be used in various useful methodologies. Furthermore, other embodiments include apparati and systems which can be constructed to apply these methods to enhance operation and use of the optical traps. In particular, the optical traps can be controlled and modified, and various embodiments employing these features are described hereinafter.<br>
12<br><br>
A variety of new uses and applications of optical traps can arise from time varying construction and dynamic change of optical trap configuration. In one form of the invention an array of optical traps can be advantageously manipulated in the manner shown in FIG. 8. In optical system 100, diffractive optical element 102 splits collimated laser beam 104 into several (two or more) laser beams 106 and 108. Each of the several laser beams 106 and 108 are transferred into a separate optical trap in an object plane 118. Each of these several laser beams 106,108 are transferred to back aperture 110 of the objective lens 112 by action of a conventional optical arrangement, such as the telescope formed by lenses 114 and 116. The objective lens 112 focuses each of these several beams 106,108 into a separate optical trap 132 in the object plane 118. In a preferred form of the invention a knife edge 120 as a selective blocking means, is disposed to be movable into the path of the several laser beams 106,108, thereby enabling selective blocking of any selected one(s) of the several laser beams 106, 108 to selectively prevent formation of a portion of the optical traps 132.<br>
