FACTOR Xa COMPOUNDS<br>
CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
		This present application claims benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application<br>
	Serial No. 60/622,156 filed October 26,2004, which is incorporated herein by<br>
5	reference in its entirety and for all purposes.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
		The present invention relates to novel compounds that function as enzyme<br>
	inhibitors, and particularly to a new class of potent and selective inhibitors of Factor<br>
	Xa. The present invention also relates to the novel compounds, their pharmaceutically<br>
10	acceptable salts, and pharmaceutically acceptable compositions thereof which are<br>
	useful as potent and selective inhibitors of blood coagulation in mammals and methods<br>
	for using these inhibitors as therapeutic agents for disease states in mammals<br>
	characterized by coagulation disorders.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
15		Proteases are enzymes that cleave proteins at single, specific peptide bonds.<br>
	Proteases can be classified into four generic classes: serine, thiol or cysteinyl, acid or<br>
	aspartyl, and metalloproteases. (Cuypers et ai., J. Biol. Chem. 257:7086 (1982)).<br>
	Proteases are essential to a variety of biological activities, such as digestion, formation<br>
	and dissolution of blood clots, reproduction and the immune reaction to foreign cells<br>
20	and organisms. Aberrant proteolysis is associated with a number of disease states in<br>
	man and other mammals. The human neutrophil proteases, elastase and cathepsin G,<br>
	have been implicated as contributing to disease states marked by tissue destruction.<br>
	These disease states include emphysema, rheumatoid arthritis, corneal ulcers and<br>
	glomerular nephritis. (Barret, in Enzyme Inhibitors as Drugs, Sandier, ed., University<br>
25	Park Press, Baltimore, (1980)). Additional proteases such as plasmin, C-l esterase, C-3<br>
	convertase, urokinase, plasminogen activator, acrosin, and kallikreins play key roles in<br>
	the normal biological functions of mammals. In many instances, it is beneficial to<br>
	disrupt the function of one or more proteolytic enzymes in the course of therapeutically<br>
	treating a mammal.<br><br>
WO 2006/047415	PCT/US2005/038182<br>
2<br>
		Serine proteases include such enzymes as elastase (human leukocyte), cathepsin<br>
	G, plasmin, C-l esterase, C-3 convertase, urokinase, plasminogen activator, acrosin,<br>
	chymotrypsin, trypsin, thrombin, Factor Xa and kallikreins.<br>
		The serine protease thrombin occupies a central role in hemostasis and<br>
5	thrombosis, and as a multifactorial protein, induces a number of effects on platelets,<br>
	endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, leukocytes, the heart, and neurons. (Tapparelli<br>
	et al., Trends in Pharmacological Sciences 14:366-376 (1993); Lefkovits and Topol,<br>
	Circulation 90(3): 1522-1536 (1994); Harker, Blood Coagulation and Fibrinolysis 5<br>
	(Suppl 1):S47-S58 (1994)). Activation of the coagulation cascade through either the<br>
10	intrinsic pathway (contact activation) or the extrinsic pathway (activation by exposure<br>
	of plasma to a non-endothelial surface, damage to vessel walls or tissue factor release)<br>
	leads to a series of biochemical events that converge on thrombin. Thrombin cleaves<br>
	fibrinogen ultimately leading to a hemostatic plug (clot formation), potently activates<br>
	platelets through a unique proteolytic cleavage of the cell surface thrombin receptor<br>
15	(Coughlin, Seminars in Hematology 31(4):270-277 (1994)), and autoamplifies its own<br>
	production through a feedback mechanism. Thus, inhibitors of thrombin function have<br>
	therapeutic potential in a host of cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular diseases,<br>
	including: myocardial infarction; unstable angina; stroke; restenosis; deep vein<br>
	thrombosis; disseminated intravascular coagulation caused by trauma, sepsis or tumor<br>
20	metastasis; hemodialysis; cardiopulmonary bypass surgery; adult respiratory distress<br>
	syndrome; endotoxic shock; rheumatoid arthritis; ulcerative colitis; induration;<br>
	metastasis; hypercoagulability during chemotherapy; Alzheimer's disease; Down's<br>
	syndrome; fibrin formation in the eye; and wound healing. Other uses include the use<br>
	of said thrombin inhibitors as anticoagulants either embedded in or physically linked to<br>
25	materials used in the manufacture of devices used in blood collection, blood circulation,<br>
	and blood storage, such as catheters, blood dialysis machines, blood collection syringes<br>
	and tubes, blood lines and stents.<br>
		Factor Xa is another serine protease in the coagulation pathway. Factor Xa<br>
	associates with Factor Va and calcium on a phospholipid membrane thereby forming a<br>
30	prothrombinase complex. This prothrombinase complex then converts prothrombin to<br>
	thrombin. (Claeson, Blood Coagulation and Fibrinolysis 5:411-436 (1994); Harker,<br>
	Blood Coagulation and Fibrinolysis 5 (Suppl 1):S47-S58 (1994)). Inhibitors of Factor<br><br>
WO 2006/047415	PCT/US2005/038182<br>
3<br>
	Xa are thought to offer an advantage over agents that directly inhibit thrombin since<br>
	direct thrombin inhibitors still permit significant new thrombin generation (Lefkovits<br>
	and Topol, Circulation 90(3): 1522-1536 (1994); Harker, Blood Coagulation and<br>
	Fibrinolysis 5 (Suppl 1):S47-S58 (1994)) because one molecule of Factor Xa may be<br>
5	able to generate up to 138 molecules of thrombin (Elodi et al., Thromb. Res. 15 (617-<br>
	619 (1979)).<br>
		Several specific inhibitors of Factor Xa have been reported. Both synthetic and<br>
	protein inhibitors of Factor Xa have been identified, and these include, for example,<br>
	antistasin ("ATS") and tick anticoagulant peptide ("TAP"). ATS, which is isolated<br>
10	from the leech, Haementerin officinalis, contains 119 amino acids and has a Ki for<br>
	Factor Xa of 0.05 nM. TAP, which is isolated from the tick, Ornithodoros moubata,<br>
	contains 60 amino acids and has a Ki for Factor Xa of about 0.5 nM.<br>
		ATS and TAP have not been developed clinically. One major disadvantage of<br>
	these two inhibitors is that administration of the required repeated doses causes the<br>
15	generation of neutralizing antibodies, thus limiting their potential clinical use.<br>
	Moreover, the sizes of TAP and ATS render oral administration impossible, further<br>
	restricting the number of patients able to benefit from these agents.<br>
		A specific inhibitor of Factor Xa would have substantial practical value in the<br>
	practice of medicine. In particular, a Factor Xa inhibitor would be effective under<br>
20	circumstances where the present drugs of choice, heparin and related sulfated<br>
	polysaccharides, are ineffective or only marginally effective. Thus, there exists a need<br>
	for a low molecular weight, Factor Xa-specific blood clotting inhibitor that is effective,<br>
	but does not cause unwanted side effects.<br>
		Low molecular weight, Factor Xa-specific blood clotting inhibitors, have been<br>
25	described in International Application WO 9529189. Indole derivatives as low<br>
	molecular weight, Factor Xa-specific blood clotting inhibitors have been proposed in<br>
	International Application 99338000.<br>

	uses thereof as Faxtor Xa inhibitors.<br>

		WO 2004002405 discloses amino-bicyclic pyrazinones and pyridinones as<br>
	Factor Xa inhibitors.<br>
10		However, it is desirable that such inhibitors have advantageous pharmacological<br>
	properties, for instance high stability in plasma and liver and high selectively versus<br>
	other serine proteases. A need continues to exist for non-peptidic compounds that are<br>
	potent and selective protease inhibitors, and which possess greater bioavailability and<br>
	fewer side effects than currently available protease inhibitors. Accordingly, new<br>
15	classes of potent protease inhibitors, characterized by potent inhibitory capacity and<br>
	low mammalian toxicity, are potentially valuable therapeutic agents for a variety of<br>
	conditions, including treatment of a number of mammalian proteolytic disease states.<br>
	In particular there continues to be a need for compounds that selectively inhibit Factor<br>
	Xa.<br>

	active metabolite forms. The present invention encompasses all such compound forms,<br>
	including active compounds in the form of essentially pure enantiomers, racemic<br>
10	mixtures and tautomers.<br>
		The compounds of the invention may be present in the form of pharmaceutically<br>
	acceptable salts. For use in medicines, the "pharmaceutically acceptable salts" of the<br>
	compounds of this invention refer to non-toxic acidic/anionic or basic/cationic salt<br>
	forms.<br>
15		The compounds of Formula I can be prepared as salts, in particular<br>
	pharmaceutically acceptable salts.<br>
		If the compounds of Formula I have, for example, at least one basic center, they<br>
	can form acid addition salts. These are formed, for example, with strong inorganic<br>
	acids, such as mineral acids, for example sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid or a hydrohalic<br>
20	acid, with strong organic carboxylic acids, such as alkanecarboxylic acids of 1 to 4<br>
	carbon atoms which are unsubstituted or substituted, for example, by halogen, for<br>
	example acetic acid, with saturated or unsaturated dicarboxylic acids, for example<br>
	oxalic, malonic, succinic, maleic, fumaric, phthalic or terephthalic acid, with<br>

	methane- or p-toluene sulfonic acid.<br>
		Corresponding acid addition salts can also be formed if the compounds of<br>
30	Formula I have an additional basic center. The compounds of Formula I having at least<br>
	one acid group (for example COOH) can also form salts with bases. Suitable salts with<br>
	bases are, for example, metal salts, such as alkali metal or alkaline earth metal salts, for<br><br>
WO 2006/047415	PCT/US2005/038182<br>
18<br>
	example sodium, potassium or magnesium salts, or salts with ammonia or an organic<br>
	amine, such as morpholine, thiomorpholine, piperidine, pyrrolidine, a mono-, di- or tri-<br>

	tributyl- or dimethyl-propylamine, or a mono-, di- or trihydroxy lower alkylamine, for<br>
5	example mono-, di- or triethanolamine. Corresponding internal salts may furthermore<br>
	be formed. Salts which are unsuitable for pharmaceutical uses but which can be<br>

		During any of the processes for preparation of the compounds of the present<br>
	invention, it may be necessary and/or desirable to protect sensitive or reactive groups<br>
	on any of the molecules concerned: This may be achieved by means of conventional<br>
	protecting groups, such as those described in Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry.<br>
15	ed. J.F.W. McOmie, Plenum Press, 1973; and T.W. Greene &amp; P.G.M. Wuts, Protective<br>
	Groups in Organic Synthesis. 3rd Edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1999. The protecting<br>
	groups may be removed at a convenient subsequent stage using methods known in the<br>
	art.<br>
		All stereoisomers of the compounds of the instant invention are contemplated,<br>
20	either in admixture or in pure or substantially pure form. The compounds of the present,<br>
	invention can have asymmetric centers at any of the carbon atoms including any one of<br>
	the R substituents. Consequently, compounds of Formula I can exist in enantiomeric or<br>
	diastereomeric forms or in mixtures thereof. The processes for preparation can utilize<br>
	racemates, enantiomers or diastereomers as starting materials. When enantiomeric or<br>
25	diastereomeric products are prepared, they can be separated by conventional methods<br>
	for example, chromatographic or fractional crystallization.<br>
		Furthermore, compounds of the invention may have one or more polymorph or<br>
	amorphous crystalline forms. Said forms are included in the scope of the invention. In<br>
	addition, some of the compounds may form solvates with water (i.e., hydrates) or<br>

	Therapeutic Use<br>
		The present invention includes a method for inhibiting Factor Xa activity with<br>
	one or more compounds of formula (I).<br>
		The compounds of the present invention are inhibitors of the activated<br>
5	coagulation serine protease known as Factor Xa and thus are useful to maintain the<br>
	fluidity of blood. Additionally, the compounds of the present invention are useful for<br>
	the treatment or prophylaxis of Factor Xa associated disorders.<br>
		As used herein, the term "Factor Xa disease, disorder or condition" refers to any<br>
	disease, disorder or condition that may be prevented, partially alleviated or cured by the<br>
10	administration of a Factor Xa inhibitor.<br>
		An example or the present invention is a method for use of one or more<br>
	compounds of formula (I) as a therapeutic agent for treating, preventing or ameliorating<br>
	a Factor Xa associated disease, disorder or condition in a subject in need thereof<br>
	comprising administering to the subject an effective amount of one or more compounds<br>
15	of formula (I) or a pharmaceutical composition thereof.<br>
		Another example or the present invention includes the use of a compound of<br>
	formula (I) for the manufacture of a medicament for treating any of the diseases,<br>
	disorders or conditions in any of the methods disclosed herein.<br>
		Accordingly, the present invention is directed to a method for treating,<br>
20	preventing or ameliorating a Factor Xa associated disease, disorder or condition in a<br>
	subject in need thereof comprising administering to the subject an effective amount of<br>
	one or more compounds of formula (I) or a pharmaceutical composition thereof.<br>
		The method includes administering to the subject an effective amount of a<br>
	compound of formula (I) or composition thereof in the form of a medicament.<br>
25	Consequently, the invention encompasses the use of the compound of formula (I) as a<br>
	medicament.<br>
		The term "treating, preventing or ameliorating" includes, and is not limited to,<br>
	facilitating the eradication of, inhibiting the progression of or promoting stasis of a<br>
	Factor Xa associated disorder.<br>
30		The term "administering," with respect to the methods of the present invention,<br>
	refers to a means for treating, ameliorating or preventing a disease, disorder or<br><br>
WO 2006/047415	PCT/US2005/038182<br>
20<br>
	condition as described herein with a compound specifically disclosed or a compound or<br>
	prodrug thereof, which would obviously be included within the scope of the invention<br>
	albeit not specifically disclosed for certain of the instant compounds.<br>
		Such methods include prophylactically or therapeutically administering an<br>
5	effective amount of one or more compounds of formula (I) or a composition or<br>
	medicament thereof at different times during the course of a therapy or concurrently in<br>
	a combination form. Prophylactic administration can occur prior to the manifestation<br>
	of symptoms characteristic of a disease or disorder such that the disease or disorder is<br>
	prevented or, alternatively, delayed in its progression. The instant invention is<br>
10	therefore to be understood as embracing all such regimes of simultaneous or alternating<br>
	treatment and the term "administering" is to be interpreted accordingly.<br>
		The term "prodrug" refers to a metabolic precursor of a compound of formula<br>
	(I) or pharmaceutically acceptable form thereof. In general, a prodrug is a functional<br>
	derivative of a compound which may be inactive when administered to a subject but is<br>
15	readily convertible in vivo into an active metabolite compound.<br>
		The term "active metabolite" refers to a metabolic product of a compound that<br>
	is pharmaceutically acceptable and effective. Conventional procedures for the selection<br>
	and preparation of suitable prodrug derivatives are described, for example, in "Design<br>
	of Prodrugs", ed. H. Bundgaard, Elsevier, 1985.<br>
20		The term "subject" as used herein, refers to a patient, such as an animal,<br>
	preferably a mammal, most preferably a human, who has been the object of treatment,<br>
	observation or experiment and is at risk of (or susceptible to) developing a Factor Xa<br>
	associated disease, disorder or condition or having a Factor Xa associated disease,<br>
	disorder or condition.<br>
25		The term "effective amount" refers to that amount of active compound or<br>
	pharmaceutical agent that elicits the biological or medicinal response (such as<br>
	inhibiting Factor Xa activity) in a tissue system, animal or human, that is being sought<br>
	by a researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor, or other clinician, which includes treating,<br>
	preventing or ameliorating the symptoms of the disease, disorder or condition being<br>
30	treated.<br>
		The effective amount of a compound of formula (I) exemplified in such a<br>
	method is from about 0.001 mg/kg/day to about 300 mg/kg/day or has an IC50 (50%<br><br>
WO 2006/047415	PCT/US2005/038182<br>
21<br>
	inhibition concentration) against Factor Xa activity in a range of about 25 μM or less,<br>
	of about 10 μM or less, of about 1μM or less, of about 0.5 μM or less, of about 0.25<br>
	μM or less or of about 0.1 μM or less.<br>
		The term "composition" refers to a product containing a compound of the<br>
5	present invention (such as a product comprising the specified ingredients in the<br>
	specified amounts, as well as any product which results, directly or indirectly, from<br>
	such combinations of the specified ingredients in the specified amounts).<br>
		The term "medicament" refers to a product for use in treating, preventing or<br>
	ameliorating a Factor Xa associated disease, disorder or condition.<br>
10		The term "pharmaceutically acceptable" refers to molecular entities and<br>
	compositions that are of sufficient purity and quality for use in the formulation of a<br>
	composition or medicament of the present invention and that, when appropriately<br>
	administered to an animal or a human, do not produce an adverse, allergic or other<br>
	untoward reaction. Since both human use (clinical and over-the-counter) and<br>
15	veterinary use are equally included within the scope of the present invention, a<br>
	pharmaceutically acceptable formulation would include a composition or medicament<br>
	for either human or veterinary use.<br>
		The methods of the present invention further include administering to the<br>
	subject an effective amount of a combination product comprising one or more<br>
20	compounds of formula (I) or a composition or medicament thereof and at least one<br>
	other therapeutic agent at different times during the course of a therapy or concurrently<br>
	as a combination product.<br>
		Such a combination product may advantageously facilitate administering to the<br>
	subject an amount of an agent or a compound of formula (I) that is either or both<br>
25	reduced relative to the amount which would be given in the absence of the other.<br>
		Therefore, it is contemplated that the compounds of this invention can be<br>
	administered to the subject before, during or after the time a particular therapeutic agent<br>
	is administered<br>
		Thus, the compounds of the present invention are useful in the treatment or<br>
30	prevention of various Factor Xa associated disorders including: thrombotic or<br>
	thromboembolic conditions; acute coronary syndromes (such as coronary artery<br><br>

5		Human α-thrombin and human Factor Xa were obtained from Enzyme Research<br>
	Laboratories (South Bend, Indiana). Human trypsin was obtained from Calbiochem.<br>
	(La Jolla, CA). Human plasmin was obtained from Enzyme Research Laboratories<br>
	(South Bend, Indiana). Bovine a-chymotrypsin (Sigma C4129) and human kidney cell<br>
	urokinase (Sigma U5004) was obtained from Sigma. Human leukocyte elastase was<br>
10	obtained from Elastin Products (Pacific, MO).<br>
		Ki Determinations: All assays are based on the ability of.the test compound to<br>
	inhibit the enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis of a peptide p-nitroanilide substrate. In a<br>
	typical Ki determination, substrate is prepared in DMSO, and diluted into an assay<br>
	buffer consisting of 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 0.05% n-octyl b-d-<br>
15	glucopyranoside. The final concentrations for each of the substrates are listed below.<br>
	In general, substrate concentrations are lower than the experimentally determined value<br>
	for Km. Test compounds are prepared as 10 mM solutions in DMSO. Dilutions are<br>
	prepared in DMSO yielding 7 final concentrations encompassing a 200-fold<br>
	concentration range. Enzyme solutions are prepared at the concentrations listed below<br>
20	in assay buffer.<br>
		In a typical Ki determination, into each well of a 96 well plate is pipetted 280<br>
	mL of substrate solution, 10 mL of test compound solution, and the plate allowed to<br>
	thermally equilibrate at 37°C in a Molecular Devices plate reader for 15 minutes.<br>
	Reactions were initiated by the addition of a 10 mL aliquot of enzyme and the<br>
25	absorbance increase at 405 nm is recorded for 15 minutes. Data corresponding to less<br>
	than 10% of the total substrate hydrolysis were used in the calculations. The ratio of<br>
	the velocity (rate of change in absorbance as a function of time) for a sample containing<br>
	no test compound is divided by the velocity of a sample containing test compound, and<br>
	is plotted as a function of test compound concentration. The data are fit to a linear<br>
30	regression, and the value of the slope of the line calculated. The inverse of the slope is<br>
	the experimentally determined apparent Ki value (Ki app). The Ki is calculated from<br><br>
WO 2006/047415	PCT/US2005/038182<br>
95<br>
	the Ki app using the Ki factor specific for the assay, where Ki = Ki app x Ki factor, or<br>

	buffer. Final DMSO concentration was 3.3%. Purified activated human Factor X was<br>
	diluted into assay buffer to a concentration of 16 nM. Final reagent concentrations<br>
	were: [Factor Xa] = 0.53 nM, [S-2765] = 100 mM.<br>
15		Trypsin: Trypsin activity was assessed as the ability to hydrolyze the substrate<br>
	S-2765 (Z-D-Arg-Gly-Arg-p-nitroanilide, Km = 61 mM, Ki factor =0.50). Substrate<br>
	solutions were prepared at a concentration of 64 mM in assay buffer. Final DMSO<br>
