FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
Present invention relates to fiber reinforced cement sheets for the purpose of building materials. In a particular aspect, the invention relates to methods for the production of building materials reinforced with synthetic fiber. More particularly present invention relates to nylon net reinforced corrugated cement sheets for roofing in housing, industrial sheds, godowns and other structures. In another aspect of the present invention, there are provided articles prepared from the nylon net reinforced cement sheets.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Concrete has the largest production of all man made materials. Compared with other construction materials, it possesses many advantages including low cost, general availability of raw materials, adaptability and utilization under different environmental conditions. Therefore, concrete will most probably continue to be the dominant construction material in the foreseeable future. Unfortunately, plain concrete is also a brittle material with very low tensile strength and strain capacity, generally requiring reinforcement before it can be used extensively as a construction material. Building materials for various uses such as roof and wall coverings, pipes, etc. have been manufactured commercially for many years by cementitious products reinforced with various fibers. Fiber reinforced cement (FRC) products are increasingly used in a variety of building applications and in an increasing range of<br><br><br>
climatically different situations and geographical regions. Such products have gained favour for their inherent fire, water, pest and mould resistance, as well as their general affordability, which makes them particularly suitable for use in meeting commercial as well as residential buildings. Moreover, FRC products are easily painted or otherwise coated or laminated with decorative finishes, such that they can be used in almost any architectural or interior design. Since cement mortar or concrete is poor in strength against bending or impact as molded articles such as wallboards to be used as building materials. Such materials include roofing tiles, corrugated sheets, interior and exterior building panels, and asbestos cement pipes.<br>
The physical properties of concrete, mortar and grouts have been improved by including synthetic fibers in the mixtures. A wide variety of synthetic fibers have been introduced into concrete mixtures in the form of monofilaments, fibrillated sheet materials and fibrils. The fibers become micromechanically bonded to the cementitious products during the hydration and polymerization reactions, in part from shrinkage of the cementitious components during the setting reactions. They can provide impact, shatter and abrasion resistance, plastic shrinkage crack control, improved post-cracking characteristics, and prolonged fatigue life. However, in order to provide these and other improved characteristics, it is essential that the fibers be uniformly dispersed in the initial mixtures.<br>
Fiber-reinforced cement materials have the following advantageous features: (1) improved in tensile strength, bending strength and impact strength,<br><br><br>
(2)	improved in deflection property,<br>
(3)	improved in cracking resistance, etc.<br>
Among common construction materials, FRC products beginning with asbestos and cement have been known for decades. Asbestos fibers have been especially popular for this purpose. Asbestos is an important cement reinforcing material because of its chemical and thermal inertness, fibrous structure and high elastic modulus. In recent years the asbestos cement industry has been attempting to find replacements for asbestos fibers because of the growing health concerns associated with asbestos and also because of reserves of the forms of this natural material suitable for cement reinforcement are being depleted and prices are increasing. However, due the dangers caused when asbestos fibers are inhaled, governing agencies in many countries have banned asbestos for many usages. Also asbestos fiber is becoming relatively expensive and its use may require special care to avoid various health-related problems. In recent years governmental regulations have restricted the use of asbestos due to its carcinogenic effects. The asbestos ban has left a void to be filled by a product to replace asbestos in use in cementitious mortars. Therefore, attempts have been made to find substitutes for asbestos.<br>
Various other fibers such as steel, glass, or synthetics to reinforce cement matrices into the cement composites are known in the art. Aveston and coworkers have suggested applying the theory of multiple cracking and crack suppression in brittle<br><br><br>
matrix composites to explain the behavior of fiber-reinforced cement, particularly cement reinforced with steel wire and carbon fibers.<br>
Although it has been attempted to use glass fibers for the reinforcing fibers as a substitute for the asbestos fibers, the glass fibers involve a drawback of reactivity with alkaline cement thereby tending to cause deterioration with time. While glass fiber reinforced cements are sensitive to age and curing under alkali conditions. Even recently developed cement based composites made from alkali resistant glass fibers become brittle after prolonged storage in the presence of atmospheric moisture or in liquid water environments, reducing the efficiency and desirability of these reinforcing agents.<br>
Synthetic fibers are strong competitors to supplement or replace glass, steel and asbestos fiber reinforcing agents. In the cement and concrete arts, fibers have been designed to increase the strength and fracture toughness of cement or concrete. Numerous fiber materials can be used for these purposes, such as synthetic polymers (e.g., polyolefins), carbon, nylon and aramid. Nylon fibers are one of the most important types of fibers as reinforcing agents for ambient-cured cement composites. These materials offer the following advantages as reinforcing agents for cement: high elastic modulus, good alkali resistance and good adhesion. Wet stretch, plastic stretch or heat-transfer fluid mediated stretching techniques assure fiber orientation in the composites, which is required for high modulus characteristics.<br><br><br>
One such attempt is disclosed in US 4040851 which utilizes cotton fibers instead of asbestos fibers, along with Portland cement, silica, and hydroxyethyl cellulose thickener. US 5108679 discloses an asbestos-free cementitious composition comprising lightweight aggregate, hydraulic cement, water and reinforcing fibers in an amount not more than 4% by weight of the total composition. The cement product reinforced with p-aramid or acrylic fiber coated with certain sulfonyl azides is disclosed in EP 0179551. An asbestos replacement is disclosed in US 5637144 which includes water retention agents and finely divided mineral clays with high moisture retention capabilities. US 4968561 discloses synthetic fiber suited for use as reinforcement for cement mortar or concrete as derived from monofilaments having a tensile strength of not less than 80 kg/mm and shows good dispersibility in cement mortar and produces very good reinforcing effect. US 4781994 disclose the fiber reinforced cement material suitable for use in preparing molded articles by using the carbon fibers. US 4414031 disclose the reinforce products made from hydraulic binder agents, fibers of polymerized acrylic nitrile. These fibers produce a product after setting and having the good bending tensile strength along with excellent impact strength. The invention in US 4363666 discloses the fiber cement product consisting of a Portland cement binder, natural and/or synthetic fibers, clay, and thickener. US 4040851 discloses cotton reinforced cementitious product, which is made by combining Portland cement, cotton fiber, inorganic filler and silica with water to form aqueous slurry. The slurry is formed into desired shapes such as sheets or slabs and cured by autoclaving to produce the desired product. The invention disclosed in US<br><br><br>
4261754 relates to a method of manufacturing a building product by mixing a hydraulic binding agent, preferably Portland cement, as a matrix with fiber reinforcement and to the product so manufactured. Particularly, but not exclusively, the invention is concerned with the manufacture of fiber reinforced building sheets and the composition of sheets so manufactured. US 4778718 disclose reinforced cementitious sheet like structures and their production. A bendable thin sheet like structure having, a cemeutitious. matrix reinforced with. ID fabric of an. organic fiber uniformly distributed throughout the thickness of structure and a continuous process for its production. GB 913893 discloses sheet building material used for walls and roofing, comprises a rigid corrugated layer 1 and a layer 2, of organic material secured to the crests of the corrugations of layer 1 and having sufficient elasticity to conform to the shape of thflt layer during piling for storage. These sheets are heat and sound insulating.<br>
So presently the following are extensively used for roofing purposes:<br>
1.	Asbestos Cement Sheets,<br>
2.	Galvanized Iron Sheets,<br>
3.	Plain Iron Sheets,<br>
4.	P.V.C. Sheets,<br>
5.	Ferro-cement sheets-<br>
1. Asbestos Cement Sheets: The asbestos sheets are hazardous to human health as asbestos causes lung cancer, asbestosis and also skin diseases. So asbestos sheets are banned in many countries like U.S.A, Russia, France, Canada, etc.<br><br><br>
Further for the manufacturing of these sheets, asbestos is to be imported and which is economically unviable. Moreover asbestos sheets do not bear impact loads as of present invention sheets.<br>
2.	Galvanized Iron Sheets: These sheets become hot and unbearable in summer days. The main problem with these sheets is corrosion and they also require continuous maintenance. Further the repairing of these sheets is also very difficult as it has tendency to bend easily.<br>
3.	P.V.C. Sheets: P.V.C. Sheets are very costly and are weak. They do not bear impact load.<br>
4.	Ferro Cement Sheets: These sheets cannot control plastic shrinkage and crack formation. These sheets are prone to rusting and corrosion and also transportation of them is not so easy.<br>
As mentioned above, no fiber has been found to be satisfactory as a reinforcing fiber for mortar and the like when evaluated in terms of reinforcing property and workability. It is therefore desirable to use new fibers as reinforcement fibers and filler material for hydraulic binder agents, such as for cement reinforcement. These new fibers must be suitable to produce fiber-containing products having the desired mechanical characteristics on the production equipment already distributed through the manufacturing industry, such as the asbestos cement industry. It is with overcoming the foregoing deficiencies of the prior art that the present invention is<br><br><br>
concerned to produce the nylon reinforced cement sheets. None of the prior art documents disclosed nylon nets with corrugation in their respective inventions. Hence present invention is nylon cement sheets are made from cement mortar and mortar is reinforced using nylon nets.<br>
The advantages of nylon cement sheets are:<br>
1.	Nylon cement sheets are economical than other roofing substitutes available.<br>
2.	These are non-hazardous for human health as well as for environment.<br>
3.	They give better strength in comparison to other available sheets.<br>
4.	Skilled labors are not required for manufacturing of these sheets.<br>
5.	No heavy machinery is required for casting of sheets.<br>
6.	One person can stand and work safely on Nylon cement sheets.<br>
7.	They fulfill the IS requirements.<br>
8.	Raw materials available in local market can be used for manufacturing of these sheets.<br>
9.	These can be recycled.<br>
10.	It creates employment opportunity.<br><br><br>
OBJECTS OF INVENTION:<br>
The primary object of the present invention is to produce the nylon cement sheets which have better structural, thermal and hydraulic behavior along with durability characteristics by using the nylon net and cement, and they can be used for roofing in housing, industrial sheds, godowns and other structures.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to produce the nylon cement sheets which are economical, durable, easy to manufacture and also easy to repair.<br>
It is the further object of this invention to provide an environmentally safe substitute for asbestos that matches the workability and water retention of that material when used in cementitious mortars. Thus to produce the nylon cement sheets which are non-hazardous to human health as well as to environment and they can be easily recycled.<br>
Thus the present inventor's main aim is to overcome all disadvantages of available roofing sheets by developing better alternative roofing sheets.<br>

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to fiber reinforced cement sheets for the purpose of building materials. In a particular aspect, the invention relates to methods for the production of building materials reinforced with synthetic fiber that, under vibration, progressively fibrillates, to produce building materials with enhanced performance properties. More particularly invention relates to nylon net reinforced corrugated cement sheets for roofing in housing, industrial sheds, godowns and other structures. The nylon cement sheets according to this invention, therefore, a nylon cement sheet consists of either plain or corrugated sheet(s), made from nylon net(s) or other reinforcing material/s like polyester, polypropylene, HDPE, glass fibers, glass-fiber-roving and the like, and cement mortar, and cured in the mould/s, wherein, the nylon net or other reinforcing material/s, the size and spacing of the net depending upon the final requirements of the said nylon cement sheet, e.g., nylon net is being used as double layer of size 0.75<br><br><br>
mm thickness and square mesh spacing 20 mm, the Depth and Pitch of corrugation of the said nylon cement sheet being obtained by corresponding mould, the length of the sheet, overall width of sheet, the effective width of the sheet, the pitch of corrugation, the depth of corrugation, the nominal thickness of sheet, the radius of both ends of corrugation, and the dimensions of nylon cement sheet, and the like parameters, all being designed as per prevailing Indian Standard &amp;/or customer's requirements. When large area is to be covered by roof, the "laps" i.e., overlaps, "one-over-other" being used as per known methods, so also for fixing the nylon cement sheet, known methods of sawing and drilling &amp; the like are being employed.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with the present invention, there are provided building product produced by fiber reinforcement in cement in the form of sheets. In a particular aspect, the nylon net is used to produce the corrugated cement sheets for roofing in housing, industrial sheds, godowns and other structures. The methods for the production of building materials reinforced with nylon net that, under vibration, progressively fibrillates, to produce building materials with enhanced performance properties such as reduced plastic shrinkage, reduced drying shrinkage, improved fire resistance, improved fatigue life, improved resistance to thermal expansion and contraction, higher toughness index, improved workability and handling, and the like. Invention reinforced building materials are prepared using fibrous material having<br><br><br>
defined initial properties and the specific ability to fibrillate resulting in substantially increased surface area upon mixing.<br>
The compositions of this invention may comprise fiber. Such fiber may be in various forms, for example monofilament, roving, or fibrillated sheet. Preferably the fiber is present in the composition in a proportion which is not greater than the critical volume fraction of the fiber with respect to the composition. The impact strength of the composition may be thus improved whilst the stress-strain relationship remains substantially unchanged. Suitable fibers which improve the impact strength include nylon.<br>
Nylon is non-decomposable material and has more tensile strength than plastic and other fibers. It is acid and alkali resistant. Due to these properties it can be used in construction applications. The enhanced bounding of nylon fibers due to moisture retention properties of the nylon can be quantified. With the increase in bond there comes an increased "Life Cycle Index". It means greater durabilility and reduced maintenance costs when compared to other forms of secondary reinforcement. For preparation of nylon cement sheet, initially proportionality of material i.e. sand and cement with the ratio of 1:2 &amp; water content 0.35 is used. The size of nylon net is decided according to the sheet size to be prepared. Casting of sheet is done using a mould. All the proportionate material is mixed thoroughly. Nylon net is spread on the mould and cement mortar is spread over the net and the mould. This mould is vibrated over the table vibrator. After the vibration of 2 minutes the net rises up due to<br><br><br>
low weight. The care should be taken that net does not come outside. The gauge marker should be used for checking thickness and checking position of net. Thickness of corrugated sheet should be 8 mm. The net placed between cement mortar acts as reinforcing material. Nylon net has good binding with cement mortar and this avoids sheet from shattering. After curing, the nylon cement sheet attains properties better than the "prior art" items. The sheets are casted and tested according to IS 5913 -1989. Use of Nylon net was our first attempt to make our nylon cement sheet.<br>
In a particular embodiment the nylon cement sheets in accordance with the invention comprises of nylon net, cement and sand. These sheets have the load bearing capacity of 31.25 N/mm, density 2.45 g/cu.cm, no frost cracks along with no permeability and water absorption. Nylon cement sheets have the nylon net of square mesh spacing of 20 mm and thickness of 0.75 mm. The cement used is Portland cement of 43 grade and sand is natural River sand having size of 2.33 mm. These sheets moulded as corrugated with pitch of 146 mm, depth of 48 mm, effective width of 1010 mm and maximum spacing of purline under the sheet is 1400 mm.<br>
Nylon cement sheet preparation method comprises the following steps:<br>
1.	Mixing of sand, cement and water;<br>
2.	Casting in corrugated mould with nylon net;<br>
3.	Vibration of the sheet material; and<br>
4.	Curing of sheet with water.<br><br><br>
1.	Mixing of sand, cement and water: The dry mixing of Portland cement of 43 grade with natural River sand having size of 2.33 mm in a proportion of 1:2 and then to this water is added slowly to form a uniform mixture of all the ingredients. The water to cement ratio to be kept at 0.35.<br>
2.	Casting in corrugated mould with nylon net: The above formed mixture is casted in corrugated mould with nylon net having the square mesh spacing 20 mm and thickness 0.75 mm to form as corrugated sheets with pitch of 146 mm, depth of 48 mm, effective width of 1010 mm and maximum spacing of purling under the sheet is 1400 mm.<br>
3.	Vibration of the sheet material: The corrugated sheet formed in the above step is vibrated by table vibrator for the uniform dispersal of the fibers in the sheet.<br>
4.	Curing of sheet with water: Finally the vibrated sheets are to be cured with water to make rigid and highly useful roofing sheets having the load bearing capacity of 31.25 N/mm, density 2.45 g/cu.cm, without frost cracks along with no permeability and water absorption properties.<br>
It may be desired to include in the present compositions a proportion of fiber which has a high tensile strength and which further increases the modulus of rupture beyond the already high limit of proportionality of the stress-strain plot. Suitable other such fibers include polyester, polypropylene, HDPE, glass fibers; glass-fiber-roving and the like can be used for reinforcing sheets.<br><br><br>
We have also attempted to produce sheets with other reinforcing materials such as polyester, polypropylene, HDPE, glass fibers, glass-fiber-roving and the like. So, in this Patent Application Specification, the term "nylon" also includes other reinforcing materials: polyester, polypropylene, HDPE, glass fibers, glass-fiber-roving and the like.<br>
