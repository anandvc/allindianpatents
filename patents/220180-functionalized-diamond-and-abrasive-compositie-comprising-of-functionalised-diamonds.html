				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to functionalized diamonds. In particular, the invention relates to functionalized diamonds with enhanced retention in resins.<br>
Diamonds, for example mesh crystals and micron powders, can be used as abrasive materials in many applications. For example, diamonds are used in abrasive tools, machinery, cutting implements, grinding tools, and other types of abrasive similar equipment. The desirability of diamonds in abrasive applications is due, at least in part to, their hardness. While diamonds, which are known as the hardest natural material, possess useful abrasive characteristics, their applications in various equipment and environments may be limited. For example, diamond applications may be limited by the retention of the. diamonds to the equipment. Often, the performance and life of the equipment is limited by retention of the diamond.<br>
The diamond is typically provided in a matrix for abrasive purposes, in which the matrix may comprise a resin. The abrasive equipment typically includes a substrate that is provided with the diamond-ladened matrix. The bond strength between the particles and matrix is the determinative strength for the abrasive equipment. Enhanced bond strength between diamonds and an associated matrix should increase the retention therebetween. Accordingly, performance and life of abrasive equipment tool provided with the diamond-ladened matrix should increase.<br>
It has been proposed to alter surfaces of diamonds to enhance the bond strength between the diamonds and associated matrix. For example, it has been proposed to functionalize diamond surfaces to enhance bond strength between the diamonds and matrix. This funcionalization attempted to modify wettability of the diamond with respect to various polymeric resin precursors. The modification attempted to increase a physical interaction bond strength between diamonds and an associated matrix.<br>
However, the physical interaction forces between a diamond and an associated matrix are weaker than those formed by chemical bonds. Further, functionalizing diamonds with moieties that are capable of forming strong covalent bonds with an associated resin are not known to have been explored for abrasive applications.<br>
Therefore, a need exists for abrasive composites, functionalized diamonds, and resinbond matrices for use in abrasive applications'. Further, a need exists for a method of providing these functionalized diamonds and resin-bond matrices with enhanced strength bonds.<br>

These and other aspects, advantages and salient features of the invention will become apparent from the following detailed description, which, when taken in conjunction with the annexed drawings, where like parts are designated by like reference characters throughout the drawings, disclose embodiments of the invention.<br>
Brief Description of the Drawings:<br>
Figure I is a set of spectra obtained by diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier-transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) on functionalized diamonds, as embodied by the invention, in a potassium bromide (KBr) matrix; and<br>
Figure 2 is a set of infrared spectra on pure (neat) diamond powder taken in an infrared microscope in the reflectance mode to discriminate against water impurities in the KBr matrix.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Functionalized diamonds, as embodied by the invention, comprise diamonds whose surfaces are functionalized with organic groups (also referred to herein as "organic functionalizing moiety" or "organic moiety") to enhance the chemical bond strength with resin-bond matrices. These organic groups can co- polymerize with a resin-bond matrix. Thus, the functionalizing, as embodied by the invention, provides a diamond surface with an enhanced bond strength, for example formed by covalent bonds, in a resin-bond matrix. For example, the covalent bonds can comprise, but are not limited to, at least one of C-C; C-0; C-N; C-Si: Si-O; and Si-N bonds.<br>
Further, the invention sets forth an abrasive composite and an abrasive tool with enhanced adhesion between diamonds with fanctionalized surfaces (hereinafter also referred to as "functionalized diamonds") and a resin- bond matrix. Thus, the abrasive composite, as embodied by the invention, comprises the functionalized diamonds, as embodied by the invention, and a resin- bond matrix. Also, the abrasive tool, as embodied by the invention, comprises functionalized diamonds and a resin- bond matrix for abrasive applications.<br>
The term "resin-bond matrix" as used herein comprises a matrix of a resinous material to which at least one functionalized diamond can be included with enhanced diamond retention therein. Further, the term "diamond" includes, but is not limited to, naturally occurring diamonds and synthetic diamonds. Also, the ten-n "diamond" comprises at least one of diamond crystals, diamond particles, and diamond micron powder particles.<br>
The bonds, as discussed above, formed between the functionalized diamonds and the resin-bond matrices in an abrasive composite typically comprise covalent bonds. The<br>
covalent bonds can be produced by co-polymerization processes, as discussed hereinafter. The functionalized diamonds for use in abrasive applications, for example, but not limited to abrasive composites, comprise diamonds whose surfaces are functionalized by being covered with molecules that are disposed thereon. The molecules are capable of co-polymerization with resin bonds in a matrix.<br>
The functionalized diamonds, as embodied by the invention, can comprise phenolic groups. The phenolic groups are bound to a diamond's surface by bonds, such as those described above. These phenolic groups can co- polymerize with phenolic-formaldehyde resins.<br>
Alternatively, the fanctionalized diamonds, as embodied by the invention, can comprise vinyl groups. The vinyl groups can be bound to a diamond surface by bonds, such as those described above. These vinyl groups can undergo condensation with vinylic resins during the co-polymerization.<br>
Another functionalized diamonds alternative, within the scope of the invention, comprises alcohol or hydroxyl groups on surfaces of diamonds. The alcohol groups are bound to a diamond surface by bonds, such as those described above, and can undergo polymerization with linear and branched polyacids and polyalcohols to form polyester resins.<br>
A further fanctionalized diamonds alternative can comprise amide groups that are 20 bound to a diamond surface by bonds, such as those described above. The amide groups can undergo polymerization with formaldehyde and at least one of urea and a polyamide.<br>
A further functionalized diamonds alternative, as embodied by the invention, can comprise aldehyde groups on surfaces of the diamonds. These aldehyde groups can co-polymerize with phenolic resins.<br>
A further functionalized diamonds alternative, within the scope of the invention, comprises epoxide groups on surfaces of the diamonds. These epoxide groups can co polymerize with epoxy and polyether resins.<br>
These functional groups are bound to a diamond surface by variable-length hydrocarbon chains, because of a high degree of steric hindrance that typically occurs near diamond surfaces. This steric hindrance may undesirably decrease the number of bonds than can be formed with resin-bond matrix molecules.<br>
A functionalized diamond, as embodied by the invention, thus comprises an organic moiety that is covalently bonded to the diamond surface by bonds, such as those described above. The organic functionalized moiety selected from: vinyl, amide, alcohol, phenolic, hydroxyl, aldehyde, and epoxide groups, and combinations thereof.<br>
The preparation of the functionalized diamonds, as embodied by the invention, can be conducted by several processes. An exemplary functionalized diamond preparation process, as embodied by the invention, comprises providing functionalized diamond particles with a near- monolayer concentration of carboxyl groups (-COOH) on its surface, or a concentration of in a range from about 0. 1 X 10 15 cm-2 to about 3x 1015 cm-2. These functionalized diamonds can be prepared by boiling diamonds in a strongly oxidizing acid (in which the term "strongly is characteristic of acids as set forth in the example below). For example and in no way limiting of the invention, the oxidizing acid can comprise at least one of concentrated HC104 or 1% to 20% nitric acid (HN03) in concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4). This process can produce fanctionalized diamond particles that are hydrophilic.<br>
The functionalized diamond particles may comprise a nearly full-monolayer of acidic groups on the diamond, that is, with a surface concentration in a range from about O.IXIOI5CM-2 to about 3x 1015CM-2. These functionalized diamond characteristics can be determined by appropriate analytic methods, such as at least one of infrared spectroscopy and basic titration.<br>
The above process next forms covalent (chemical) bonds between the acidic diamond surface and a co-polymerizable molecule, also known as a functionalizing moiety. These covalent bonds can be formed by acid- catalyzed esterification or base-catalyzed amidization. Equations (1) through (5) set forth nomenclature for exemplary reactions that form covalent bonds, as embodied by the invention.<br>
(Equation 1 Removed)<br>
(Equation 2 Removed)<br>
(Equation 3 Removed)<br>
(Equation 4 Removed)<br>
(Equation 5 Removed)<br>
Alternatively, the covalent bonds can be produced by other reactions. Equations (6) through (10) set forth the nomenclature for further exemplary reactions that form covalent bonds, as embodied by the invention.<br>
(Equation 6 Removed)<br>
(Equation 7Removed)<br>
(Equation 8 Removed)<br>
(Equation 9 Removed)<br>
(Equation 10 Removed)<br>
In each of the reactions in Equations (1-10), x is an integer between 0 and about 20. This value for x should allow for variable distances between the diamond surface and polymerizable functional group, for example, a polymerizable functional group selected from phenolic, vinyl, hydroxyl, amide, or aldehyde groups. The reactions set forth in Equations (1-10) provide enhanced bond strength in resin-bond matrices.<br>
The invention also provides for functionalized diamonds with enhanced stability in aqueous acid or base environments. Some conventional chemical environments may cause the covalent bonds, for example, but not limited to, covalent bonds in the form of ester and amide linkages, to be unstable. These chemical environments are encountered in diamond processing steps, such as, but not limited to, heating of the fanctionalized diamonds in aqueous acid or base environments. For fanctionalized diamonds with enhanced stability in aqueous acid or base 'environments, the functional groups are attached to diamond surfaces by carbon-carbon, either-type carbon-oxygen, or secondary amine- type carbon-nitrogen bond linkages. These functional groups can be synthesized by the following exemplary process.<br>
Alternatively, the chlorination step can be performed by photochemical reaction, exposing the diamond powder to ultraviolet radiation in a chlorine-containing environment. For example, and in no way limiting the invention, the ultraviolet radiation may be provided by a high-pressure mercury arc lamp.<br>
Initially, diamond surfaces are hydrogenated. The hydrogenating step can comprise heating to the diamonds to a temperature in a range from about 700°C to about 1200°C in a hydrogen-containing environment. The hydrogenated diamond surfaces can then be chlorinated. The step of chlorinating can comprise heating the hydrogenated diamond to a temperature in a range from about 100°C to about 500°C 25 in a C12- containing environment.<br>
The hydrogenating and chlorinating reactions are indicated schematically in Equations (11) and (12), respectively.<br>
(Equation 11 Removed)<br>
(Equation 12 Removed)<br>
The chlorinated diamond may react with hydrogen-containing molecules to produce molecules that are bound to diamond and HCI, particularly if the hydrogen atom(s) are more reactive than those in aliphatic hydrocarbons. Exposure of chlorinated diamond to water vapor at room temperature can produce OH groups that are bound to the diamond surface.<br>
Surface vinyl groups can produced functionalized diamonds. The vinyl groups for functionalized diamonds can be produced by reacting chlorinated diamond with propylene at a temperature in a range between about 100°C and about 600°C. Allylic C-H bonds are more reactive than normal aliphatic C-H bonds, and therefore a reaction as in Equation (13) can occur:<br>
(Equation 13 Removed)<br>
Alternatively, reaction of the chlorinated diamond with propylene can be performed by photochemical reaction, exposing the diamond powder to ultraviolet radiation in a propylene- containing environment.<br>
Similarly, surface phenolic groups can be produced on diamonds for forming functionalized diamonds, as embodied by the invention. The surface phenolic groups on functionalized diamonds can be produced by reacting chlorinated diamond with p cresol at a temperature in a range between about 100°C and about 600°C. This reaction occurs as methyl C-H bonds in toluene are generally weaker than aromatic CH bonds, and thus a reaction as set forth in Equation (14) can occur:<br><br>
(Equation 14 Removed)<br>
Alternatively, reaction of the chlorinated diamond with cresol can be performed by photochemical- reaction, exposing the diamond powder to ultraviolet radiation in a cresol-containing environment.<br>
Chlorinated diamond reacts more readily with O-H and N-H bonds than it does with C-H bonds, and the vinyl, phenolic, alcohol, amide, aldehyde, and epoxide moieties of the present invention can be formed by reactions with appropriate alcohols or arnmes.<br>
Vinyl, alcohol, amide, aldehyde, phenolic, and epoxide groups can be formed on the diamond surface by reacting chlorinated diamond with polyfunctional alcohols at a temperature between about 0°C and about 600°C, as indicated.in Equations (15) through (20), respectively:<br>
(Equation 15 Removed)<br>
(Equation 16 Removed)<br>
(Equation 17 Removed)<br>
(Equation 18 Removed)<br>
(Equation 19 Removed)<br>
(Equation 20 Removed)<br>
Alternatively, vinyl, alcohol, amide, aldehyde, phenolic, and epoxide groups can be formed on the diamond surface by reacting chlorinated diamond with polyfunctional amines at a temperature between about 0°C and about 600°C, as indicated in Equations (21) through (26), respectively:<br>
(Equation 21 Removed)<br>
(Equation 22 Removed)<br>
(Equation 23 Removed)<br>
(Equation 24 Removed)<br>
(Equation 25 Removed)<br>
(Equation 26 Removed)<br>
The functionalized diamond surfaces, which are described on the right hand side of Equations (l)-(10) and (13)-(26), can react with precursors that are selected from the group comprising phenolic resins, vinyl resins, polyester resins, epoxy resins, and thermoset resins. The reaction can be attributed to chemistries in the resin precursor. Therefore, when chemical covalent bonds are formed between functional groups and resin by co-polymerization, as embodied by the invention, the diamond will be bound to the resin-bond matrix.<br>
The reactions set forth in Equations (l)-(10), (13)-(26) are suitable for polymerization to chemically bind resin to diamond surfaces to form abrasive composites use analogous chemistries. Combinations of the above-described reactions in Equations (l)-(10), (13)-(26) can be employed in reactions within the scope of the invention.<br>
The functionalized diamonds and the resin-bond matrices that form abrasive composites<br>
with the functionalized diamonds, as embodied by the invention, can be used in various<br>
applications. The functionalized diamonds and the resin- bond matrices with the<br>
functionalized diamonds can be used in the fabrication of resinbonded abrasive<br>
applications, such	as, but not limited to, grinding tools. These tools<br>
should exhibit enhanced life and performance. An abrasive composite, such as but not limited to a resin bond system, comprises functionalized diamonds, as embodied by the invention, filler materials, such as silicon carbide (SiQ and copper (Cu) powders, and resin materials.<br>
One exemplary process to form the functionalized diamonds, as embodied by the invention, will now be described. The values set forth below are approximate and terms in the description of the invention herein are used with their meaning as understood by a person of ordinary skill in the art. This exemplary process should not be construed as linfiting the invention, and is intended for exemplary purposes only.<br>
A starting material comprised a diamond powder with a particle size of 0. 75-1.25 urn. 100g of this diamond was reacted for Ih in a boiling mixture of 1000 ml of concentrated H2SO4 and 100 ml of 70% HNO3, to functionalize the diamond surface with carboxylic acid groups,. When the mixture had cooled, the diamond powder settled out from suspension and the acid was poured off. The diamond was then rinsed by suspending it in 20OOmL of deionized H2O. After 12-24 hours of settling time, the rinse water was poured off. This rinsing procedure was repeated until the pH of the mixture was near 7. A final rinse was then conducted with 1000 mL of acetone.<br>
When the diamond had settled, the acetone was poured off and the remaining diamond/acetone slurry was allowed to dry under ambient conditions to yield the carboxylic acid functionalized product.<br>
To functionalize the surface with vinyl groups, lOg of the carboxylic acid fanctionalized<br>
product from above was placed in a 100 ML round bottom flask. 50 mL of acetone and<br>
10 mL of 5-hexen-t-ol were poured into the flask. A reflux condenser was affixed to the<br>
top of the flask and the mixture was heated in a water bath. When the temperature<br>
reached 50°C, 5 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid was added through the reflux<br>
condenser. Heating was continued until the mixture began to boil at 75°C. The flask was<br>
occasionally swirled to suspend the diamond as necessary. After refluxing for 30 min at<br>
75°C,	the	mixture	was	cooled	to	room<br>
temperature and the reaction liquid was poured off of the settled diamond. The diamond prodict was then washed 5 times by suspending it in 75 ML portions of acetone, allowing time for the diamond to settle, and pouring off the acetone, After the fifth rinse the diamond/acetone slurry was allowed to dry under ambient conditions yielding the vinyl treated product.<br>
To verify the functionalization of the diamond, as embodied by the invention, a diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier-transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) test was performed on the samples. For enhanced sensitivity, the functionalized diamonds were mixed with potassium bromide (KBr) powder as in known in the art. The spectral results are illustrated in Fig. 1. Further spectra of pure (neat) diamond powder samples were taken in an infrared microscope in the reflectance mode to discriminate against water impurities in the KBr matrix. These further spectra are illustrated in Fig. 2.<br>
The test indicated that in untreated diamond powder, a large spectral peak occurs at<br>
1760 cm-1 and may be assigned to a stretching mode of surface &gt;C=O groups, as known in the art. Additional spectral peaks occur at frequencies in a range from about 1500cm-1 and about 1006 cm-1 in untreated powder and these may be assigned to a combination of C-0 modes associated with C-O-C ether groups and C-OH hydroxyl groups, also as known. A broad spectrum peak in a range from about 3000 cm-1 to about 3700 cm-1 (Fig. 1) is believed to be mainly due to physisorbed water in the KBr matrix. This peak was diminished in reflectance spectra of the neat diamond powder (Fig. 2). Finally, the spectrum peaks that are in a range from about 1900 cm- to about 2400 cm-1 are due to bulk absorption in diamond powder rather than to surface species.<br>
The spectrum of the powder after treatment in HN03/H2SO4 is qualitatively similar to that discussed above, however, it illustrates differences that indicate an increase in the concentration of surface -COOH groups. The &gt;C=O stretching mode intensity has<br>
increased has shifted to about 1788 cm-1, which is consistent with an increase in the degree of surface oxidation. A broad 'peak in a range from about 3000 cm-1 to about 3700 cm-1 is larger (Fig. 1) and also prominent in reflectance spectra of the neat diamond powder (Fig. 2), and is indicative of surface COO-H stretch modes. The concentration of surface - COOH groups is believed to be about one monolayer, or in a range from about 1. 5 -2.0 x 1015cm-2.<br>
After treatment of the acid-treated diamond with 5-hexen-l-ol under acid- catalyzed esterification conditions, a low-frequency spectrum portion is largely unchanged, however, but new peaks due to C-H stretch modes may occur in a range from about 2800 cm-1 to about 3100 cm-1. These peaks between are believed to be due to SP3 hybridized CH2 groups in chemisorbed -(CH2)4CH=CH2 species, while the peak at 3080 cm-1 is due to the sp2 -hybridized CH=CH2 groups in the same species. The intensities of vinyl CH and aliphatic CH2 peaks is about 0.045, in general agreement with a corresponding ratio (0.17) observed in -CH2-CH=CH-CH2- chemisorbed on diamond (100) after correction for the relative numbers of hydrogen atoms. The orientation of the C=C bonds is different in the two cases, and a mode of spectroscopy is different (diffuse reflectance versus total internal, reflection). Thus, precise agreement in the infrared intensity ratio is not expected. No new C-OH mode appears in the spectrum, which indicates that CH modes are due to chemisorbed species rather than residual 5-hexen-1 -ol impurity in the diamond powder.<br>
Further, a COO-H peak is greatly reduced in intensity, as illustrated in the reflectance<br>
spectrum (Fig. 2). Taken together, these spectral observations (Fig. I and Fig. 2) indicate<br>
that -COOH groups on a diamond surface after the acid treatment have reacted with the<br>
5-hexen-l-ol to form -COO(CH2)4CH=CH2, as embodied by the invention. The reduction<br>
by a factor in a range from about 2 to about 3 in the COO-H intensity suggests formation<br>
of about 1/2 to 2/3	of a monolayer of surface vinyl groups,<br>
and alternatively a surface concentration in a range from about 0.8 to about 1.3x1015 cm-2.<br>
