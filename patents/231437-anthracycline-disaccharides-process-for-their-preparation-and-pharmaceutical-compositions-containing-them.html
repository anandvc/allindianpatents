				<td>Anthracycline disaccharides, process for their preparation, and<br>
pharmaceutical compositions containing them<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention is referred to compounds of general formula (I) and<br>
(II), respectively<br><br>
where:<br>
R is H or OH or the OR7 group where R7 = CHO or COCH3 or the acylic<br>
residue of a carboxylic acid containing up to 6 carbon atoms;<br>
R1 is H or OH or OCH3;<br>
R2 is H or F;<br>
R3 is H or OH;<br>
R4 and R5, identical or different, are each H or OH or NH2;<br>
and bond symbol   indicates that substituents R3, R4, and R5<br>
may be either in axial or equatorial position; and their pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts having anticancer properties.<br>
As may be seen in the above formulas, compounds (I) and (II) differ<br><br>
exclusively in the space arrangement of the glycosidic groups and,<br>
therefore, may be represented by formula (A)<br><br>
where symbol   indicates that the second carbohydrate residue may<br>
be bound to carbon atom 4' of the first sugar either in axial or in<br>
equatorial position.<br>
The present invention is also referred to the process for the<br>
preparation of said compounds, their pharmaceutically acceptable salts,<br>
and the pharmaceutical compositions containing them.<br>
State of the art<br>
Daunorubicin and doxorubicin are well-known antibiotics that are<br>
currently used in the clinical practice for the treatment of a variety of<br>
solid tumours and leukaemia (F. Arcamone in "Doxorubicin: Anticancer<br>
Antibiotics", A.C. Sartorelli, Ed., Academic Press, N. Y., 1981).<br>
European patent No. EP A 0457215 discloses products whose structure is<br>
similar to that of the products claimed herein, but having only one<br>
glycosidic group.<br>
As known, however, the severe side effects caused by the anticancer<br>
agents used at present impose limits on the use of same in a good number<br>
of patients who, otherwise, would benefit from the treatment. Moreover,<br><br>
remarkable advances are needed in the treatment of some important solid<br>
tumours, e.g. pulmonary and ovarial, that do not adequately respond to<br>
any current treatment.<br>
It follows that there is an urgent need for the coming onto the market of<br>
drugs highly selective in their inhibitory action against the<br>
proliferation of diseased cells compared with the normal ones.<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide new anticancer<br>
compounds, in particular anthracycline analogues, in which the<br>
carbohydrate portion consists of a disaccharide residue.<br>
It has surprisingly been found that the claimed anthracycline<br>
disaccharides, in which the sugar directly bound to aglycone never<br>
contains amino groups, exhibit higher anticancer activity and selectivity<br>
than the anthracycline previously known. It is worth noting that in the<br>
known anthracyclines, which contain two or more carbohydrate residues,<br>
the sugar bound to aglycone always contains a free or substituted amino<br>
group.<br>
The compounds according to the present invention are the compounds of<br>
general formula (I) and (II), as reported above, and their<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts where R, R1, R2, R3, R4, and R5 are as<br>
described above.<br>
The present invention is also referred to pharmaceutical compositions<br>
containing said compounds, or salts thereof with pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable acids, preferably hydrochloric acid.<br>

The compounds of general formula (I) and (II) can be prepared by a<br><br>
process consisting of the following steps:<br>
a) condensation of a compound of formula (III)<br>
(III)<br><br>
where R1 and R2 are as defined above and R6 is H or the OR7 group where<br>
R7 is a protective group for an alcoholic function, preferably selected<br>
among the acetyl-, dimethylterbutylsilyl- or<br>
p-methoxyphenyldiphenylmethyl- groups, with a compound of formula (IV) or<br><br>
where R8 is H or a protected -OH group, preferably p-nitrobenzoate; R9<br>
and R10, identical or different, are each H or a protected OH group,<br>
preferably p-nitrobenzoate or a protected NH2 group, preferably<br>
trifluoroacetamide or allylcarboxyamide and X is a group capable of<br>
generating, under the condensation conditions, a stable carbo-cation that<br>
may bind itself to a hydroxyl group in position C-7 of the compound of<br>
formula (III), said group X being conveniently selected among the groups<br>
used in glycosidation reactions, e.g. a halogen such as chlorine or<br><br>
bromine, preferably chlorine, or a p-nitrobenzoyloxy group. Compounds of<br>
formula (VI) or (VII) are thus obtained:<br><br>
where R1, R2, R6, R8, R9, R10 and symbol   are as defined above;<br>
b) one or more reaction/s of removal of the protective groups of OH<br>
and/or NH2 functions from compounds of formula (VI) and (VII) to give<br>
compounds of formula (I) and (II), where R, R1, R2, R3, R4, R5 and symbol<br>
  are as defined above;<br>
c) conversion, if any, of the aforesaid glycosides of formula (I) and<br>
(II) into a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, preferably<br>
chlorhydrate.<br>
The reaction conditions for the glycosidation of a compound of formula<br><br>
(III) with a compound of formula (IV) or (V) to give a compound of<br>
formula (VI) or (VII) may vary depending on the type of substituents<br>
present in the compounds of formula (IV) or (V).<br>
Glycosidation is carried out in an inert organic solvent in the presence<br>
of a condensing agent.<br>
The condensing agents used are, e.g., silver trifluoromethane sulphonate,<br>
silver perchlorate, mixtures of mercury oxide and mercury bromide, boron<br>
halides, titanium or tin tetrachloride or ion exchange resins, such as<br>
Amberlite.<br>
Glycosidation is preferably carried out with 1:1 to 1:3 molar ratios in<br>
an inert organic solvent, such as for example benzene, toluene, ethyl<br>
ether, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, chloroform, methylene chloride or<br>
dichloroethane and mixtures thereof.<br>
The reaction temperature may range from -40°C to 40°C, preferably from -<br>
20°C to 20°C, and the reaction time from 15 min to 3 hrs.<br>
The reaction mixture may include a dehydrating substance, such as an<br>
activated molecular sieve.<br>
In the course of the reaction or at the reaction end, the reaction<br>
mixture may be added with an organic base, such as pyridine, collidine,<br>
N,N-dimethylaminopyridine, triethylamine or 1,8-bis-(dimethylamino)-<br>
naphthalene.<br>
According to the present invention, the removal of the protective groups<br>
for OH and/or NH2 functions from compounds of formula (VI) and (VII) to<br>
give compounds of formula (I) may be carried out under different<br>
conditions depending on the type of protective group used.<br>
When R9 and/or R10, identical or different, are each a protected NH2<br>
group such as trifluoroacetamide or a protected OH group such as p-<br>
nitrobenzoate, and/or R8 is a protected OH group such as p-<br><br>
nitrobenzoate, and/or R6 is a protected OH group such as acetate,<br>
deprotection reactions are carried out in a polar solvent, such as water,<br>
methanol, ethanol, pyridine, dimethylformamide or mixtures thereof and in<br>
the presence of an inorganic base, in a stoichiometric amount or in<br>
excess of the stoichiometric, such as sodium, potassium, lithium or<br>
barium hydroxide or carbonate.<br>
The reaction temperature may range from 0°C to 50°C and the reaction time<br>
from 3 hrs to 48 hrs.<br>
When R9 and/or R10 are each a protected NH2 group such as<br>
allylcarboxyamide, deprotection is carried out in an inert solvent and in<br>
the presence of a metal complex such as<br>
tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium, as disclosed, e.g., in Tetrahedron<br>
Letters, 30, 3773 (1989), or tetracarbonyl nickel, as disclosed, e.g., in<br>
J. Org. Chem., 38, 3233 (1973).<br>
When R6 is a protected OH group such as dimethylterbutylsilylether,<br>
deprotection is carried out in an inert solvent and in the presence of<br>
tetrabutylammonium fluoride, as disclosed, e.g. in J. of Antibiot., 37,<br>
853 (1984).<br>
When R6 is a protected OH group such as<br>
p-methoxyphenyldiphenylmethylether, deprotection is carried out in an<br>
acid medium, e.g. in aqueous acetic acid, as disclosed, e.g. in J. Org.<br>
Chem., 42, 3653 (1977).<br>
Compounds of formula (III) are either known or may be prepared according<br>
to methods and processes known in organic chemistry, as disclosed, e.g.<br>
in Gazz. Chim. Ital., 114, 517 (1984), in Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. , 59, 423<br>
(1986), and in the aforementioned Italian patent application by the<br>
Applicant, whose disclosures are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Compounds of formula (IV) or (V) are either known or may be prepared<br><br>
according to methods and processes for the synthesis of disaccharides<br>
known in organic chemistry [J. Carbohydr. Chem., 10, 833 (1991);<br>
Carbohydr. Res., 74, 199 (1979); Carbohydr. Res., 208, 111 (1980);<br>
Tetrahedron, 46, 103 (1990)].<br>
Alternatively, if so desired, anthracycline glycosides of formula (I) and<br>
(II), where R1, R2, R3, R4, R5 are as defined above and R is an OH group,<br>
may be prepared from glycosides of formula (I) and (II) or from<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, where R1, R2, R3, R4, R5 and<br>
symbol  are as defined above and R is H, by bromination of the<br>
carbon in position 14 with bromine in chloroform followed by hydrolysis,<br>
at room temperature for a period of 48 hrs, of the resulting 14-<br>
bromoderivatives with sodium formate.<br>
If so desired, glycosides of formula (I) and (II) may be converted into<br>
their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, e.g. chlorhydrates, by treatment<br>
with hydrochloric acid in methyl alcohol.<br>
The present invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions<br>
containing, as active ingredient, a compound of formula (I) or (II) or a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof combined with a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable diluent or carrier.<br>
According to the present invention, a therapeutically effective dose of a<br>
compound of formula (I) or (II) is combined with an inert carrier.<br>
The compositions may be formulated in a conventional manner using common<br>
carriers.<br>
The claimed compounds are useful for the therapeutic treatment on humans<br>
and other mammals. In particular, said compounds are good anticancer<br>
agents when administered in therapeutically effective doses.<br>
The following examples illustrate the present invention in more detail.<br><br>

lyxo-exopyranosyl]-4-demethoxy-daunorubicinone chlorhydrate (compound of<br>
formula II, R=R1=R2=H, R3=R5=OH, R4=NH2) .<br>
A mixture of 4-demethoxydaunorubicinone (compound of formula III,<br>
R1=R2=R6=H) (300 mg, 0.81 mmol) and 2,6-dideoxy-4-0-(2,3,6-trideoxy-4-0-<br>
p-nitrobenzoyl-3-trifluoroacetamido-α-L-lyxo-exopyranosyl)-3-0-p-<br>
nitrobenzoyl-α-L-lyxo-exopyranosyl-p-nitrobenzoate (compound of formula<br>
IV, R3=R5=p-nitrobenzoyl-oxy-, R4=trifluoroacetamido-, X=p-<br>
nitrobenzoyloxy-) (600 mg, 0.72 mmol) in methyl chloride (72 ml) and<br>
ethyl ether (24 ml) in the presence of molecular sieves (A4) at -20°C was<br>
treated with trimethylsilyltriflate (266 µl; 1.44 mmol). The reaction<br>
mixture was stirred for 1 hr, then it was diluted with methylene<br>
chloride, washed with a saturated sodium bicarbonate solution, and<br>
evaporated to dryness. The residue was separated by chromatography on<br>
silica gel (eluent CH2Cl2-Et0H, 99/1) yielding 360 mg of 7-0-[2,6-<br>
dideoxy-4-0-(2,3,6-trideoxy-4-0-p-nitrobenzoyl-3-fluoroacetamido-α-L-<br>
lyxo-exopyranosyl)-3-O-p-nitrobenzoyl-α-L-lyxo-exopyranosyl]-4-<br>
demethoxydaunorubicinone (compound of formula VII, R1=R2=R6=H, R8=R10=p-<br>
nitrobenzoyloxy-, R9=trifluoroacetamido-).<br>
A protected diglycoside suspension of compound of formula (VII)<br>
(R1=R2=R6=H, R8=R10=p-nitrobenzoyloxy-, R9=trifluoroacetamido-) (120 mg;<br>
0.117 mmol) in 17.6 ml of a 0.1 M solution of Ba(0H)2 in H2O/MeOH, 1/1,<br>
was maintained under stirring at room temperature for a period of 3 hrs.<br>
The reaction mixture was neutralized with a 0.2 M potassium bisulphate<br>
solution and extracted with chloroform; the organic extracts were<br>
collected together, dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate, evaporated to<br>
dryness, and taken up with 0.002 M HCl solution. The acid aqueous<br><br>
solution was washed with chloroform and freeze-dried to give 62 mg of the<br>
desired product (compound of formula II, (R=R1=R2=H, R3=R5=OH, R4=NH2).<br>
Yield 39%.<br>
