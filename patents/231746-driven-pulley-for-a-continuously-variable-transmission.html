				<td>[DRIVEN PULLEY FOR A CONTINUOUSLY VARIABLE TRANSMISSION<br>
Continuously variable transmissions (CVTs) are commonly used-on a wide range<br>
of vehicles, such as small cars or trucks, snowmobiles, golf carts, scooters, etc.<br>
They typically comprise a driving pulley mechanically connected to a motor, a<br>
 driven pulley mechanically connected to wheels or a track, possibly through<br>
another mechanical device such as a gear box, and a trapezoidal drivebelt<br>
transmitting torque between the driving pulley and the driven pulley. A CVT<br>
automatically changes the ratio as required by load and speed conditions,<br>
providing an increased torque under high loads at low speeds and yet controlling<br>
the rotation speed of the motor as the vehicle accelerates. A CVT may be used<br>
with all kinds of motors, such as interna! combustion engines or electric motors.<br>
The sides of the drivebelt are, on each pulley, gripped between two opposite<br>
sheaves that are coaxially mounted around a corresponding main shaft.<br>
Generally, in each pulley of a conventional CVT, one sheave, usually called "fixed<br>
sheave", is rigidly connected to one end of the corresponding main shaft. The<br>
other sheave, usually called "movable sheave", is free to slide and/or rotate with<br>
reference to the fixed sheave by means of bushings or the like.<br>
At a low vehicle speed, the winding diameter of the drivebelt at the driving pulley is<br>
minimal and the winding diameter of the driven pulley is maximum. This is<br>
referred to as the minimum ratio since there is the minimum number of rotations or<br>
fraction of rotation of the driven pulley for each full rotation of the driving pulley.<br>
Generally, when the rotation speed of the driving pulley increases, its movable<br>
sheave moves closer to the fixed sheave thereof under the effect of a centrifugal<br>
mechanism. This forces the drivebelt to wind on a larger diameter on the driving<br>
pulley and, consequently, on a smaller diameter on the driven pulley. The<br>
drivebelt then exerts a radial force on the sheaves of the driven pulley in addition<br>
to the tangential driving force by which the torque is transmitted. This radial force<br>
urges the movable sheave of the driven pulley away from the fixed sheave thereof.<br><br>
It is counterbalanced in part by a return force, which is typically generated by a<br>
spring inside the driven pulley or another biasing mechanism. It is also<br>
counterbalanced by a force generated by the axial reaction of the torque applied<br>
by the drivebelt on the driven pulley. This is caused by a cam system that tends to<br>
move the movable sheave towards the fixed sheave as-the torque increases. The<br>
cam system typically comprises a cam plate having a plurality of symmetrically-<br>
disposed and inclined ramps on which respective cam followers are engaged. The<br>
followers are usually sliding buttons or rollers. The set of ramps or the set of<br>
followers is mounted on the movable sheave and the other is directly or indirectly<br>
connected to the main shaft in a rigid manner. The closing effect of the cam<br>
system on the drivebelt tension is then somewhat proportional to output torque.<br>
Generally, at the maximum vehicle speed, the ratio is maximum as there is the<br>
maximum number of rotations or fraction of rotation of the driven pulley for each<br>
full rotation of the driving pulley. Then, when the vehicle speed decreases, the<br>
rotation speed of the driving pulley typically decreases as well since the rotation<br>
speed of the motor decreases. This causes, at some point, a decrease of the<br>
winding diameter of the driving pulley and a decrease of the radial force exerted by<br>
the drivebelt on the sides of the sheaves at the driven pulley. Ultimately, the<br>
driven pulley is allowed to have a larger winding diameter as the spring or another<br>
biasing mechanism" moves the movable sheave back towards the fixed sheave.<br>
Some CVTs are provided with reversible driven pulleys. A reversible driven pulley<br>
operates in a similar fashion than that of a conventional one, with the exception<br>
that the transmission ratio can be controlled during motor braking or when the<br>
vehicle is traveling in reverse. For instance, during motor braking, the torque is no<br>
longer coming from the motor to the wheels or track, but in the opposite direction.<br>
Similarly, when accelerating in reverse, the torque and the rotation will be in the<br>
reverse direction, the torque being transmitted from the motor to the wheels or<br>
track, A reversible driven pulley generally comprises a second set of ramps and a<br>
second set of followers. In use, one set of followers and its corresponding set of<br><br><br>
ramps are used when the torque is in one direction, the other set being used<br>
for the other direction.<br><br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,403,976, issued on 13 September 1983 to Takagi, discloses<br>
a driven pulley having two sheaves, one of which includes a set of ramps and <br>
the other a set of inwardly projecting followers.	<br>
A common problem to most driven pulleys is that they tend to be heavy and<br>
cumbersome, especially in applications where a high torque is transmitted.<br>
There was thus a need to provide a driven pulley having a new configuration<br>
and design which allows a more compact and efficient design.<br>
In the present invention, there is provided a driven pulley for use on a main<br>
shaft defining a rotation axis. The driven pulley is characterized in that it<br>
comprises:<br>
a first sheave having a first side and a second side, the first sheave<br>
comprisig:<br>
a substantially annular and radially-extending main portion, the<br>
main portion having a conical wall provided on the first side of<br>
the first sheave;<br>
a substantially axially-extending bracket portion connected to the<br>
main portion and projecting from the second side of the first<br>
sheave, the bracket portion defining an internal enclosure<br>
opened at the first side of the first sheave;<br>
a sleeve portion connected to the bracket portion at a distal location<br>
with reference to the main portion; and<br>
at Least two ramps symmetrically-disposed with reference to the<br>
rotation axis and connected to the first sheave inside the internal<br>
enclosure;<br>
a second sheave having a first side and a second side, the second sheave<br>
comprising:<br><br>
a substantially annular and radially-extending main portion, the main<br>
portion of the second sheave having a conical wall on the first side thereof, which<br>
conical wall faces the conical wall of the first sheave to form a belt-receiving<br>
groove between them ;<br>
an outer sleeve portion axially projecting from the first side of the second<br>
sheave ;<br>
an inner sleeve portion coaxially positioned inside the outer sleeve<br>
portion, the inner sleeve portion and outer sleeve portion defining between them<br>
an annular space with a substantially closed bottom ; and<br>
at least two followers and corresponding outwardly projecting mounting<br>
supports symmetrically disposed on the outer sleeve portion ; and<br>
an axially-disposed helical spring having one end resting against the closed<br>
bottom of the annular space and an opposite end connected to a fixed location<br>
with reference to the first sheave ;<br>
In use, the outer sleeve portion of the second sheave is housed in the internal<br>
enclosure of the first sheave and each follower is configured and disposed for<br>
being in engagement with a corresponding ramp, the sleeve-portion of the first<br>
sheave being rigidly connected to the main shaft while the inner sleeve portion of<br>
the second sheave being free to rotate and slide with reference to the main<br>
shaft.<br>

Overview<br>
Referring to FIGS. 1 to 6, there is shown an example of a driven pulley (10)<br>
according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. It is to be<br>
understood that the present invention is not limited to.this precise embodiment and<br>
that various changes and modifications may be effected therein without departing<br>
from the scope or spirit of the present invention. For instance, although the<br>
illustrated driven pulley (10) is a reversible model, it is also possible to construct it<br>
without being reversible.<br><br>
The driven pulley (10) is mounted on a main shaft (not shown) which defines a<br>
rotation axis. Generally, single parts of the driven pulley (10) are coaxially<br>
mounted around the rotation axis and multiples of a same part are symmetrically<br>
disposed around it in order to have a properly-balanced device, as apparent to a<br>
person skilled in art.<br>
In use, the torque,is transmitted to or from the main shaft by the driven pulley (10).<br>
This torque is supplied from or to a trapezoidal drivebelt (not shown). The<br>
trapezoidal drivebelt has one end wound on a driving pulley (not shown) and the<br>
other end wound on the driven pulley (10), more particularly around a first (12) and<br>
a second sheave (40). The torque usually goes from the driven pulley (10) to the<br>
main shaft. However, in some circumstances, especially if the driven pulley (10) is<br>
reversible, the torque can be transmitted in the opposite direction<br>
First sheave<br>
The first sheave (12) has a first side (14) and a second side (16). Most portions of<br>
the first sheave (12), if not all, are part of a one-piece aluminum die-cast or the<br>
like. These portions are thus integrally-connected together. The first portion is a<br>
substantially annular and radially-extending main portion (20). The main portion<br>
(20) has a conical wall (22) provided on the first side (14) of the first sheave (12)<br>
and Is designed to engage one side of the trapezoidal drivebelt.<br>
The first sheave (12) further comprises a substantially axially-extending bracket<br>
portion (30) connected to the main portion (20) and projecting from the second<br>
side (16) of the first sheave (12). The bracket portion (30) generally defines ah<br>
internal enclosure (32) opened at least at the first side (14) of the first sheave (12).<br>
As best shown in FIG. 3, the back of the bracket portion (30) is preferably provided<br>
with a plurality of reinforcing ribs (31).<br>
The first sheave (12) also comprises a sleeve portion (34) connected to the<br>
bracket portion (30) at a distal location with reference to the main portion (20).<br>
The sleeve portion (34) has a central hole (35) allowing the main shaft to be<br><br>
inserted therein. The sleeve portion (34) acts as a connection point between the<br>
driven pulley (10) and the main shaft. This allows the torque to be transmitted<br>
between them. This connection may be achieved in a number of ways. In the<br>
illustrated and preferred embodiment, the driven pulley (10) is rigidly connected to<br>
the main shaft by a mounting tube (38) which is to be coaxially-mounted over the<br>
main shaft. The mounting tube (38) has one end rigidly connected to the<br>
perimeter of the hole (35) of the sleeve portion (34). It also has a hollow interior in<br>
which the main shaft can be tightly inserted. Retention means, for instance a<br>
spline, a screw, internal teeth, etc. provide the torque-transmitting engagement, as<br>
apparent to a person skilled in the art. The mounting tube (38) can also be<br>
retained by welding, glue, etc. The length of the mounting tube (38) must be<br>
sufficient for allowing its free end to extend beyond the second sheave (40). This<br>
way, the mounting tube (38) can be used as a base for the second sheave (40)<br>
and the other parts. The driven pulley (10) can then be assembled in advance and<br>
simply fitted into place on the main shaft.<br>
The first sheave (12) further comprises at least one or two pairs of ramps (36),<br>
depending if the driven pulley (10) is reversible or not. The ramps (36) are<br>
preferably provided near the side openings (33). The ramps (36) are<br>
symmetrically-disposed with reference to the rotation axis and connected to the<br>
first sheave (12) inside the internal enclosure (32). When the driven pulley (10) is<br>
reversible, as in the preferred embodiment, two sets of ramps (36) are provided.<br>
FIG. 6 shows the relative position of the two ramps (36) of a same set in the<br>
preferred embodiment. One will be for the forward direction, the other being for<br>
the reverse direction. The ramps (36) of the first set are not necessarily identical<br>
to those of the second set.<br>
Second sheave<br>
Referring back to FIG. 1, the driven pulley (10) further comprises a second sheave<br>
(40) having a first side (42) and a second side (44). The.second sheave (40) can<br>
be in the form of a one-piece item or be made of a plurality of parts secured <br><br>
together. Like the first sheave (12), the second sheave (40) has a substantially<br>
annular and radially-extending main portion (50). The main portion (50) of the<br>
second sheave (40) has a conical wall (52) on its first side (42). The conical wall<br>
(52) is preferably identical to the conical wall (22) provided on the first sheave (12).<br>
Once the sheaves (12,40) are assembled, both conical walls (22, 52) face each<br>
other and form between them a belt-receiving groove (18), as best shown in<br>
FIG. 2.<br>
The second sheave (40) also comprises an outer sleeve portion (60) axially<br>
projecting from the first side (42) of the second sheave (40), as shown in FIG. 4.<br>
The outer sheave portion (60) is sized to fit into the internal enclosure (32) of the<br>
first sheave (12) once the driven pulley (10) is assembled.<br>
An inner sleeve portion (62) is coaxially positioned inside the outer sleeve portion<br>
(60). The inner sleeve portion (62) has a smaller outer diameter than the inner<br>
diameter of the outer sleeve portion (60) so as to define between them an annular<br>
space (64) with a substantially closed bottom. As best shown in FIG. 4, the inner<br>
sleeve (62) comprises bushings (66) or the like on the interior side thereof. This<br>
allows the second sheave (40) to slide and rotate with reference to the main shaft,<br>
thus moving relative of the first sheave (12). The bushings (66) can be in<br>
engagement with the main shaft directly. However, in the preferred embodiment,<br>
the second sheave (40) is mounted on the mounting tube (38) and consequently,<br>
the bushings (66) are in sliding and rotational engagement with the mounting tube<br>
(38). Of course, the bushings (66) can be replaced by an equivalent, such as<br>
bearings or the like.<br>
As best shown in FIGS. 2 and 4, the inner sleeve portion (62) slightly extends from<br>
the end of the outer sleeve portion (60). This provides a stop for limiting the<br>
minimum spacing between the first (12) and the second sheave (40). This is<br>
however optional.<br><br>
Followers (70) and corresponding mounting supports (72) are symmetrically<br>
disposed on the outer sleeve portion (60). Each follower (70) can be in the form of<br>
a sliding button, a roller or the like, depending on the needs. The mounting<br>
supports (72) are configured and disposed to allow each follower (70) to engage a<br>
corresponding ramp (36). Each mounting support (72) projects radially from the<br>
outer sleeve portion (60) and comprises a clamp (74) where the follower (70) is<br>
installed. In the preferred embodiment, the followers (70) are installed in the<br>
clamps (74) and a screw (76) or another retaining means is used to fully maintain<br>
the follower (70) in place, as shown in FIG. 1.<br>
When designing the driven pulley (10), the size of the internal enclosure (32) must<br>
be such that the outer sleeve portion (60) and the mounting supports (72) can be<br>
inserted therein. Preferably, the mounting supports (72) are projecting out of side<br>
openings (33) when the second sheave (40) is in place. This provides two main<br>
advantages. The first is that the Internal enclosure (32) can be smaller when the<br>
mounting supports (72) are allowed to move within the side openings (33). The<br>
other advantage is that the followers (70) can be inspected and replaced without<br>
the need of disassembling the driven pulley (10).<br>
The second side (44) of the second sheave (40) is provided with a plurality of<br>
reinforcing ribs (46), as shown in FIG. 2.<br>
Spring<br>
The driven pulley (10) comprises an axially-disposed helical spring (80) having<br>
one end resting against a fixed point at the closed bottom of the annular space<br>
(64) and an opposite end connected to a fixed location with reference to the first<br>
sheave (12). In the preferred embodiment, as shown in FIG. 2, the fixed end of<br>
the spring (80) rests against an optional protector (82), itself resting on a stop (84)<br>
held by a C-clip (86) or another means connected to the mounting tube (38). The<br>
spring (80) is pre-loaded in compression and/or in torque, depending on the<br>
needs.<br><br>
The purpose of the spring (80) is to create a return force urging the second sheave<br>
(40) towards the first sheave (12). This return force counterbalances the radial<br>
force exerted by the drivebelt on the conical walls (22,52). The spring (80) can be<br>
pre-loaded in torque, with or without a pre-load in compression, so as to force the<br>
followers (70) to move up the ramps (36). This also forces the second sheave (40)<br>
to move closer to the first sheave (12).<br>
Operation<br>
In use, the outer sleeve portion (60) of the second sheave (40) is housed in the<br>
internal enclosure (32) of the first sheave (12). Each follower (70) of a same set<br>
engages a corresponding ramp (36). The torque, if transmitted from the drivebelt,<br>
. has one half going through the first conical wall (22) and a second half going<br>
through the second conical wall (52). The torque in the first sheave (12) is directly<br>
transmitted to the main shaft by the bracket portion (30), the sleeve portion (34)<br>
and then the optional mounting tube (38). The other half of the torque, in the<br>
second sheave (40), is transmitted to the outer sleeve portion (60), the mounting<br>
supports (72) and then the followers (70). The followers (70) transmit the torque in<br>
their turn to the ramps (36), that being added to the first torque half and following<br>
the same path.'<br>
When the driven pulley (10) is designed to be reversible, as in the preferred<br>
embodiment, doubled-sided sliding buttons (70) can be provided, each side of the<br>
follower being capable of engaging a corresponding ramp (36). An example of a<br>
double-sided sliding button (70) is shown in FIG. 5. As shown in FIG. 6, one side<br>
of the sliding button (70) can engage one ramp (36) while the other can engage<br>
the opposite ramp (36). The driven pulley (10) will go through a short transition<br>
when the torque changes direction. In that case, the second sheave (40) will<br>
slightly rotate with reference to the first sheave (12), thereby changing the side of<br>
the sliding button (70) and the set of ramps (36) being used.<br><br>
Advantages<br>
As can be appreciated, the present invention allows the driven pulley (10) to be<br>
constructed in very compact manner and consequently with a smaller weight<br>
compared to an equivalent conventional driven pulley. Another advantage is that<br>
the followers (70) and the removable ramps (36'), if any, can be installed,<br>
inspected and replaced after the assembly of the driven pulley (10).<br>
Alternative embodiment with removable ramps<br>
Another possible embodiment is shown in FIGS. 7 to 10. In this embodiment, the<br>
ramps (36), or at least one set if there is more than one, are each removably<br>
connected to the first sheave (12) by means of a fastener, for instance a bolt (90).<br>
Other kinds of fasteners can be used as well. The removable ramps, identified<br>
with reference numeral 36', are positioned in corresponding seats (92) of the first<br>
sheave (12). Once in position, the boll (90) is inserted through a hole (94) made in<br>
the largest part of the removable ramp (36') and reaches a threaded hole (96)<br>
provided in the seat (92). It is tighten thereafter. The hole (94) in the removable<br>
ramp (36') is located in a region where the follower (70) will not reach it.<br>
FIG. 8 shows a removable ramp (36') against which a double-sided follower (70) is<br>
engaged. The general operation of the driven pulley (10) remains unaffected by<br>
the presence of removable ramps (36') compare to integrated ramps (36).<br>
FIGS. 9 and 10 show an individual removable ramp (36'). The ramp (36') features<br>
a plurality of side protrusions (98) designed to position the removable ramp (36') at<br>
the right location in its seat (92).<br>
Using removable ramps (36') allows changing the behavior of the driven pulley<br>
(10) for a given purpose without having to modify the first sheave (12) itself. The<br>
same first sheave (12) can thus be used for different kinds of vehicles and with<br>
different settings. Yet, the above-described and illustrated design further allows<br><br>
removing and installing the removable ramps (36') without having to remove the<br>
driven pulley (10) or its first sheave (12) from the vehicle.<br><br><br>
