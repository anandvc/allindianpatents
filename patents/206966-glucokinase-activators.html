The dyes (A), (B) and (C) in the inks according to the invention contain no further colouring molecular moieties in addition to the colouring molecular moieties mentioned.<br>
The dye (A) in the inks according to the invention preferably contains, as the colouring molecular moiety (chromophore), one or two radicals of the formula (1), (II), (III) or (IV).<br>
If the dye (A) contains a radical of the formula (I), (II), (ill) or (IV), a non-chromophoric radical is bonded to this radical via the free valency drawn in the formulae (I), (II), (III) and (IV).<br>
Examples of a non-chromophoric radical are the following:<br>

independently of one another are a substituent which is not fibre-reacted, for example C,-C4alkoxy, C1-C4alkylthio which is unsubstituted or substituted in the aikyl moiety by hydroxyl, sulfato, sulfo or carboxyl, hydroxyl, amino, N-mono- or N,N-di-C,-C4alkylamino which is unsubstituted or substituted in the alkyl moiety by hydroxyl, carboxyl, C,-C4alkoxy, sulfato or sulfo, morpholino, phenylamino or N-C|-C4alky!-N-phenylamino, which are unsubstituted or substituted in the phenyl ring by sulfo. carboxyl, acetylamino, chlorine, methyl or methoxy,<br><br>
and in which the alkyl is unsubstituted or substituted by hydroxy!, sulfo or sulfate, or naphthylamino which is unsubstituted or substituted by 1 to 3 sulfo groups.<br>
Non-chromophoric radicals which are bonded via the free valency in the formuia (|), (it), (iH) or (IV) are also fibre-reactive radicals.<br>
Fibre-reactive radicals are, for example, an alkanoyl or alkylsulfonyl radical substituted by an atom which can be split off or a group which can be split off, an all<enoyi or alkenesulfonyl radical which is unsubstituted substituted by an atom can be split off a group alkenoyl contains vinyl group. the alkanoyl alkylsulfonyl and radicals mentioned as rule contain to carbon atoms atoms. these are also carbo- heterocyclic rings off. for example those at least one substituent bonded inter alia reactive ring such monoazine diazine triazine pyridine pyrimidine pyridazine pyrazine thiazine oxazine asymmetric symmetric triarine system has more fused-on aromatic quinoline phthalazine quinazoline quinoxaline acridine phenazine phenanthridine system.></enoyi>
Atoms which can be split off and groups which can be split off are, in addition to others, for example, halogen, such as fluorine, chlorine or bromine, ammonium, including hydrozinium, sulfate, thiosulfato, phosphate, acetoxy, propionoxy, azido, carboxypyndinium or thiocyanato.<br>
The fibre-reactive radical and the chromophore of the formula (1), (II), (III) or (IV) can be bonded to one another by a bridge member. Bridge members are, in addition to the direct bond or, for example, an amino group, the most diverse radicals. The bridge member is, for example, an aliphatic, aromatic or heterocyclic radical; the bridge member can furthermore also be composed of different such radicals. The bridge member as a njle contains at least one functional group, for example the carbonyl, sulfonyl, carbonylamino, sulfonylamino or the amino group, it being possible for the amino group to be further substituted by C ,-C4alkyl which is unsubstituted or substituted by halogen, hydroxyl, cyano. C1-Calkoxy,<br><br>

The inks according to the invention which comprise dyes with fibre-reactive radicals are thus suitable for use in the printing of paper or textiles.<br><br>
Inks which comprise dyes without fibre-reactive radicals are particularly suitable for recording on paper, and especially for use in the printing of paper.<br>
Textile fibre materials are, in particular, fibre materials containing nitrogen or containing hydroxy! groups, tor example textile fibre materials of cellulose, silk, wool or synttietic polyamides.<br>
Examples of paper which can be printed witti the inks according to the invention are commercially available ink-jet paper, photographic paper, glazed paper and paper coated with plastic, for example Epson Ink-Jet Paper, Epson Photo Paper. Epson Glossy Film, HP Special Ink-Jet Paper, Encad Photo Gloss Paper and llford Photo Paper. Films of plastic which can be printed with the inks according to the invention are, for example, transparent or milky/opaque. Suitable films of plastic are, for example, 3M Transparency-Film.<br>
The present invention thus also relates to a process for printing paper, films of plastic or<br>
textile fibre materials, in particular by the ink-jet printing process, which comprises using an<br>
aqueous ink which comprises<br>
20 to 95% by weight of at least one dye (A) together with 5 to 80% by weight of at least one<br>
dye chosen from the group consisting of (B) and (C), based on the total weight of the dyes<br>
(A), (B) and (C) in the ink, and<br>
1 to 40% by weight of a water-miscible organic solvent, based on the total weight of the ink,<br>
wherein<br>
the dyes (A), (B) and (C) are as defined and preferred above.<br>
In the case of the ink-jet printing process, individual drops of the ink are sprayed out of a jet in a controlled manner onto a substrate. The continuous ink-jet method and the drop-on-demand method are chiefly used for this. In the case of the continuous ink-jet method, the drops are produced continuously, drops which are not required for printing being diverted into a collecting container and recycled. In the case of the drop-on-demand method, on the other hand, drops are produced and printed as required, i.e. drops are only produced if this is necessary for printing. The drops can be produced, for example, by means of a piezo ink-jet head or by means of thermal energy (bubble jet). Printing by means of a piezo ink-jet head is preferred for the process according to the invention. Printing by the continuous ink-jet method is furthermore preferred for the process according to the invention.<br><br>
The records produced, such as, for example, prints, are distinguished by good biaclt shades without a change in shade in artificial light (metamerism) with an outstanding fastness to light. Records which are produced with inks comprising a dye (A) together with a dye (C) show no "orange bieeding" of the black shade.<br>
The present invention also relates to black-dyeing dye mixtures which comprise 20 to 95% by weight of at least one dye (A) together with 5 to 80% by weight of at least one dye chosen from the group consisting of (B) and (C), based on the total weight of the dyes (A), (B) and (C) in the dye mixture, where the dye (A) has the formula (5), the dye (B) has the formula (6) and the dye (C) has the formula (7), in which the radicals Rio, Rn, R12.
