				<td>Field of the invention:<br>
The present invention relates to a low viscosity, non-aqueous liquid coolant for use in laser systems and a process for the preparation thereof. More particularly, the present invention relates to a ready to use laser coolant for use in laser systems in fighter aircrafts and a process for the preparation of said coolant. The coolant of the present invention shows complete absorption of Ultra Violet rays. At the same time, the coolant is completely transparent to visible as well as Infra Red radiations.<br>
Background and Prior Art of the invention:<br>
In a laser generating system, heat is generated during the laser generation process. This heat needs to be effectively dissipated and the system temperature needs to be maintained in a desired range. For this purpose, a coolant is used in the laser system. In fighter planes with laser generating units, this coolant has to meet stringent criteria of complete UV ray absorption, low freezing points, desired viscosity etc. In the present invention, a process has been developed for the preparation of such very effective coolant for laser systems in fighter aircrafts. Besides, the same coolant can be used in other types of laser systems also, where such cooling is desired.<br>
Reference may be made to 4,445,217, which relates to a laser cooling system having a coolant formulated to act as a heat exchanger and a transparent optical medium of matching refractive index between the flash-lamp, silver reflectors and laser rod. The coolant has one or more fluorescent dyes and an inorganic pH buffering additive therein and the lamp is in a cerium doped envelope. The coolant has ethylene glycol and a fluorescent dye therein. The coolant fluid has Rhodamine 6G (Rh-6G) dye added thereto. The coolant also contains 3, 3' Diethyloxatricarnocynanine Iodide (DOTC Iodide) therein. The coolant fluid in the laser cooling system has an inorganic buffer additive therein. An inorganic buffer additive is added to the coolant to inhibit acidification. Sodium tetra-borate is used and provides a high buffering capacity, i.e. approximately twenty-five percent (25%) of the ethylene glycol would have to oxidize before a critical pH change would occur. Fluorescent dyes are used as additives in the coolant. Two dyes mainly used as coolant additives in the present invention are: Rhodamine 6G (Rh-6G) and 3,3' Diethyloxatricarnocynanine Iodide (DOTC Iodide).<br>
Reference may be made to WO/2005/050798 (International Patent Application Number PCT/EP2004/013232), which relates to a coolant for a laser assembly, whose heat is<br>
dissipated by the coolant, which is conducted in a coolant circuit. Said coolant consists of a liquid medium, which contains at least one additive that is dissolved in the coolant, said additive coating the surfaces of the cooling circuit that come into contact with the coolant with an inorganic or organic protective coating. The coolant is used in a method for operating the laser assembly. The liquid medium itself is preferably made of pure and deionized water.<br>
Reference may be made to US patent number 6,900,248 which relates to a process for the synthesis of hydrocarbons comprising conducting a Fischer-Tropsch reaction. The coolant used in this patent comprises methanol, ethanol or mixtures thereof.<br>
Reference may be made to US3,593,194. In this invention, crystal lasers are cooled by means of a solution of copper ions in an alcohol solvent. Copper ions in the solution absorb ultraviolet radiation in the wavelength region shorter than 3000 angstroms, while allowing substantially all of the longer wavelength pumping energy to pass through. The alcohol solvent, and in particular the preferred 4:1 mixture of ethanol and methanol, has a very low freezing point and good heat transfer characteristics so that the laser crystal can be kept at a low temperature favorable to high operating efficiency.<br>
None of the prior art documents teach or suggest a coolant usable for all laser generating systems, which shows complete absorption of Ultra Violet rays and at the same time being completely transparent to visible as well as Infra Red radiations.<br>
Objectives of the invention:<br>
The primary objective of the present invention is to provide a low viscosity, non-aqueous<br>
liquid coolant for use in laser systems.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of low<br>
viscosity, non-aqueous liquid coolant for use in laser systems.<br>
A further objective of the present invention is to provide an effective coolant for Laser<br>
generating systems in aircrafts.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide a method of preparing coolant for<br>
laser generating systems for fighter aircrafts.<br>
Summary of the invention:<br>
A low viscosity, non-aqueous liquid for absorbing heat during laser generation process is<br>
provided. This liquid also shows complete absorption of Ultra Violet rays. At the same time, the fluid is completely transparent to visible as well as Infra Red radiations. The liquid coolant circulates in the laser generating system and effectively dissipates the heat generated during the process. The invention also provides a process for the preparation of low viscosity, non-aqueous liquid coolant. The coolant of the present invention is ready-to-use and is useful for all types of laser systems. This coolant is of non-aqueous nature. This coolant can also be used as a coolant in other systems where there are embedded electric contacts and/or complete absorbance of ultra-violet radiation and/or complete transmittance is desired in visible and infra-red regions.<br>
Statement of the invention:<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a low viscosity, non-aqueous liquid coolant for absorbing heat produced during laser generation process, said coolant comprising polydimethylsiloxane, benzophenone, o-hydroxybenzophenone and a corrosion inhibitor mixed together.<br>
The present invention also provides a process for the preparation of low viscosity, non¬aqueous liquid coolant for absorbing heat produced during laser generation process, said process comprising:<br>
(a)	adding benzophenone in the range of 0.1 to 0.25 percent w/v to polydimethylsiloxane while stirring continuously;<br>
(b)	to the solution of step (a), adding o-hydroxybenzophenone solution in the range of 0.01 to 0.02 w/v of polydimethylsiloxane, o-hydroxybenzophenone being dissolved separately in n-butanol before adding to the solution of step (a);<br>
(c)	finally adding a corrosion inhibitor in the range of 0.15 to 0.25 % w/v to obtain the desired coolant.<br>
Detailed Description of the invention:<br>
The present invention provides a low viscosity, non-aqueous liquid coolant for absorbing heat during laser generation process.<br>
The low viscosity, non-aqueous liquid for absorbing heat during laser generation process of present invention also shows complete absorption of Ultra Violet rays. At the same time, the fluid is completely transparent to visible as well as Infra Red radiations. The liquid coolant circulates in the laser generating system and effectively dissipates the heat generated during<br>
the process. The invention also provides a process for the preparation of low viscosity, non¬aqueous liquid coolant. The coolant of the present invention is ready-to-use and is useful for all types of laser systems. This coolant is of non-aqueous nature.<br>
Thus prepared coolant is tested for UV absorbance using UV spectrometer. It is colorless and permits visible and NIR rays to completely pass through it. It does not corrode the metal components. This coolant can also be used as a coolant in other systems where there are embedded electric contacts and/or complete absorbance of ultra-violet radiation and/or complete transmittance is desired in visible and infra-red regions.<br>
Thus, the present invention provides a low viscosity, non-aqueous liquid coolant for<br>
absorbing   heat   produced   during   laser   generation   process,   said   coolant   comprising<br>
polydimethylsiloxane, benzophenone, o-hydroxybenzophenone and a corrosion inhibitor<br>
mixed together.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, benzophenone is in the range of 0.1 to 0.25<br>
percent w/v of polydimethylsiloxane.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, o-hydroxybenzophenone is in the range of<br>
0.01 to 0.02 %w/v of polydimethylsiloxane.<br>
In yet an embodiment of the present invention, said corrosion inhibitor is Irgamate - 39.<br>
In a further embodiment of the present invention, the corrosion inhibitor Irgamate-39 is in the<br>
range of 0.15 to 0.25 % w/v of polydimethylsiloxane.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a process for the<br>
preparation of low viscosity, non-aqueous liquid coolant for absorbing heat produced during<br>
laser generation process, said process comprising:<br>
(a)	adding benzophenone in the range of 0.1 to 0.25 percent w/v to polydimethylsiloxane while stirring continuously;<br>
(b)	to the solution of step (a), adding o-hydroxybenzophenone solution in the range of 0.01 to 0.02 w/v of polydimethylsiloxane, o-hydroxybenzophenone being dissolved separately in n-butanol before adding to the solution of step (a);<br>
(c)	finally adding a corrosion inhibitor in the range of 0.15 to 0.25 % w/v to obtain the desired coolant.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, said corrosion inhibitor is Irgamate - 39. In another embodiment of the present invention, a process has been devised for preparing the above mentioned fluid. This fluid contains 100 percent v/v of polydimethylsiloxane (1.5<br>
centistoke viscostiy at 25 degree C). To this fluid, benzophenone in the range of 0.1 to 0.25 percent w/v is added for UV absorbance. Besides, o-hydroxybenzophenone is also added in the range of 0.01 to 0.02 percent w/v for enhancing absorbance throughout the UV region (200 to 400 nm). For effective dissolution of this ortho-hydroxybenzophenone in the parent fluid, its solution is prepared in small quantity of extra pure n-butanol (2 to 5 ml) with adequate stirring. The overall fluid is also added with sufficient amount of corrosion inhibitor (Irgamate - 39) in the range of 0.15 to 0.25 % w/v.<br>
The constituents of this coolant are not reacting chemically, but interacting synergistically to efficiently absorb the heat generated in a laser system and also the ultra violet rays produced while inhibiting the corrosion of the metal components. The coolant is not a mere admixture.<br>
Examples:<br>
The following examples are for the purposes of illustration only and therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of present invention:<br>
Following is the process for preparing one such composition of one liter of the coolant at<br>
ambient temperature:<br>
Firstly, 1000 ml of polydimethylsiloxane (having 1.5 centiStokes kinematic viscosity at 25<br>
degree C) is taken in a large beaker.<br>
To this liquid, 1.5 grams of Benzophenone (synthesis grade, i.e. 0.15 percent w/v) is added<br>
while continuously stirring the liquid.<br>
Now to this, Ortho-HydroxyBenzophenone solution is added, which is prepared in n-Butanol.<br>
This solution is prepared separately in a small beaker by dissolving 0.135 gms of O-<br>
HydroxyBenzophenone (synthesis grade) in 3.6 mis of extra pure n-Butanol while constantly<br>
stirring.<br>
In the final stage, 0.2 percent of Irgamate 39 (Ciba Geigy specialty chemicals) is added with<br>
constant stirring.<br>
Thus prepared liquid coolant is free from water, and can be used in systems with embedded<br>
electric contacts.<br>
Important process parameters:<br>
The complete dissolution of UV absorbent ingredients as well as inhibitor is crucial to the<br>
properties of the prepared fluid. Therefore constant stirring is essential for the same. Besides,<br>
organic solvent (n-butanol) in minimal essential quantity is also used for dissolving O-benzophenone.<br>
