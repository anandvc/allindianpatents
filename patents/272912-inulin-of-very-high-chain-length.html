Inulin of very high chain lengtl.<br>
The invention relates to a particularly long-chain inulin and its preparation from artichoke roots, to its use in foodstuffs and cosmetic preparations and to foodstuffs and cosmetic preparations which comprise the particularly long-chain inulin.<br>
The demand for foodstuffs which contain little fat and more natural raw materials has increased greatly in recent decades. Many substances have already been proposed as substitute for fats, such as products based on carbohydrates or protein or synthetic fat substitutes such as sugar polyesters of fatty acids. However, these always have disadvantages such as a low thermal stability, an unsatisfactory "mouth feci" or an unwanted effect on people or the environment.<br>
It has been known for a long time that inulin is suitable for use in food products. Inulin has a low energy value available for humans and thus use of inulin as fat substitute ensures a large reduction in the calorific value of the final product, in addition, inulin is used as prebiotic addition and bulking agent in foodstuffs.<br>
Inulin is a polysaccharide belonging lo ihe frucian group. Jt consists of a beta-^-1 -linked chain of fructose molecules, and this chain may have an alpha-D-glucose unit at the reducing end. Inulin occurs in economical!}' recoverable amounts in various plants such as. for example, chicory roots. Jerusalem artichoke and dahlia tubers. The average chain lengths of the various inuiins and their physicochemical properties differ from plant species to plant species.<br>
The inuiins employed to date in the foodstuffs sector are not entirely satisfactory in their processing properties such as. for example, viscosity in aqueous pasty form, thermal stability and stability to acid, emulstfiability and water-binding capacity.<br>
There is in addition a need for inuiins with improved fermentation properties and a greater prebiotic effect.<br>
A further problem is that on extraction of inulin with hot water from the plant tissue the extract contains besides the polymer crude inulin also monosaccharides such as glucose and fructose, disaccharides such as sucrose and fruciooligosaccharides (DP 3-10). These by-products (mono-and disaccharides. fructooligosaccharides (DP 3-10) may interfere with further processing of the inulin. For example, mono- and disaccharides are undesired in the manufacture of dietetic food<br>
 <br>
products. The sweel taste of the mono- and disaccharides and fructooiigosaccharides (DP 3-10) interferes with certain applications in the food products sector. Fructooiigosaccharides (DP 3-10) maj, because of their hygroscopic in and tackiness, interfere greatly with the use of crude inulin in food products both during processing and during storage. During further processing of the crude inulin. for example by chemical derivatization. mono- and disaccharides and fructooiigosaccharides (DP 3-10) ma\ lead lo undefined mixtures ol' products which can be purified only by cosily methods or not at all. In addition, a high proportion of reducing sugars has the disadvantage that in thermal processes in the presence of amino compounds there may be unwanted browning reactions, the formation of off-flavors and the production of acrylamide (Maillard reaction).<br>
The present invention is based on the object of providing an inulin with which it is possible to solve the problems defined above.<br>
The intention was in particular to achieve advantageous processing properties for applications in cosmetics and the foodstuffs industry. Examples thereof are an advantageous viscosity behavior. a high thermal stability and stability to acid, a good emulsifiabiiity and a high water-binding capacity.<br>
One problem addressed by the invention was additionally lo provide an inulin having improved fermentation properties and improved prebiotic effect for foodstuffs applications.<br>
Finally, it was desirable to provide an inulin which, by comparison with crude inulin. has a smaller content of mono- and disaccharides and of fructooligosaccharides (DP 3-10).<br>
The foregoing problems are solved by the provision of the embodiments defined in the claims.<br>
The present invention relates to an inulin which has an average degree of polymerization DP,, of between 65 and 81. preferably between 65 and 79. even more preferably between 66 and 78. ven- particularly even more preferably between 66 and 76. yet more preferably between 66 and 74 and most preferably between 66-73.<br>
In this connection and in connection with the present invention, the term "between" is also intended to include the respective!} indicated numerical limits.<br>
 <br>
The term "inulin" is intended to mean in connection with the present invention a polvfructan which consists of a beta-2-l-linked chain of fructose molecules. This chain preferabl} has at its end a reducing alpha-D-glucose unit.<br>
In connection with the present invention, the term "average degree of polymerization DP«" (average DP weight) means the quotient of the weight-average molecular mass M„ and the molecular mass of the monomer M„- The weight-average molecular mass Mtt results from<br>
Mw=	—      .<br>
IKMi<br>
where Ni is the number of molecules with molecular mass Mi.<br>
The "average degree of polymerization DP,," is preferably measured in connection with the present invention by the method of "gel permeation chromatography with light scattering and refractive index detection (GPC-RI-MAI.f S system)" described hereinafter.<br>
The inulin of the invention exhibits, by comparison with inulins described in the prior art. the surprising advantage that it can be processed to creams which exhibit unusually high stability on heat treatment or acid treatment, so that the)' are more suitable for example for particular industrial applications or applications in the cosmetics and/or food products industries. In addition, creams comprising the inulin of the invention show an unexpectedly high stability toward shear forces. The inulin of the invention thus exhibits the further advantage, compared with conventional inulin. that it can be processed better in industrial processes in which strong shear forces act.<br>
The inulin of the invention is further notable for particularly advantageous viscosity properties and a high gel strength and a very lov\ solubility, which is advantageous for foodstuffs applications.<br>
In addition, the inulin of the invention shows surprisingly good properties as fat substitute in foodstuffs with excellent sensory properties in the mouth.<br>
 <br>
The inulin of the invention also shows by comparison with previous!} employed products a slower fermentation, which is advantageous in the pre\ention of diseases in the posterior large bowel. The slower fermentation is accompanied by a reduced formation of gas in the bowel, especially of hydrogen.<br>
The inulin of the invention additionally has by comparison with previously employed products a greater prebiotic effect. In particular, the inulin of the invention stimulates the generation of bifidobacteria in an advantageous manner with a simultaneous reduction of unwanted and/or pathogenic bacteria. The inulin of the invention is therefore suitable for use in foodstuffs and/or medicaments for the prevention and treatment of bowel dysfunctions and diseases, especially in the posterior large bowel.<br>
Finally, the inulin of the invention also confers on various foodstuffs advantageous use properties such as. for example, viscosity increase, emulsifiability, water-binding capacity and crumb formation. The inulin of the invention surprisingly confers improved baking properties on baken products and increases the dough yield. The inulin of the invention is moreover an effective means for flavor modification and foam stabilization.<br>

The "average degree of polymerization DP,r is measured in connection with the present invention preferably by the method of "gel permeation chromatography with light scattering and refractive index detection (GPC-R1-MALLS system)" described hereinafter.<br>
In connection with the present invention, the term "average degree of polymerization DP,," (mean DP number) means the quotient of the number-average molecular mass M„ and the molecular mass oi' the bound monomer M„ (anhvdrofructose = 162 g/mol). The number-average molecular mass M„ results from<br>
 <br>
 <br>
where Ni is the number of molecules having molecular mass M|.<br>
in a further embodiment, which may include the previous embodiments, the inulin of the invention has a molecular weight distribution in the range from 650 to 48 000. more preferably 970 to 40 000 g/mol. even more preferably 1300 g/mol to 34 000 g'mol and most preferably from 4000 g/mol to 26 800 g/mol.<br>
In yel a further embodiment, which may include ihe previous embodiments, the inulin of the invention shows a total mass of inulin molecules having a molecular weight of  20 000 g/mol based on the total mass of all inulin molecules of 5-20%. )t is even more prefeiTed for the lota] mass of inulin molecules having a molecular weight of  20 000 g/mol based on the total mass of all inulin molecules to be 9-1 5%.<br>
The molecular weight distribution is preferably measured in connection with the present invention by the method of "gel permeation chromatography with light scattering and refractive index detection (GPC-Ri-MALLS system)" described hereinafter.<br>
In one embodiment of the inulin of the invention with particularly advantageous properties, the degree of branching is 0.5-2.0 mo!%. more preferably 0.7-2.0 mo!%. even more preferably 0.9 to 2.0 mol% and most preferably 1.1 to 2.0 mol%. The degree of branching is defined herein as the percentage number of beta-2-!-linked fructose monomers with additional branch point at position 6 of the fructose monomer (also abbreviated to "2-1.6-" hereinafter) based on the total number of all inulin monomers measured in a sample of the inulin of the invention with randomh distributed molecular weights. At its position 6. a "2-1.6-" fructose monomer within a polyfructose chain is linked to another polyfructose chain, consisting of at least two beta-2-1-iinked fructose monomers, or to a single fructose monomer. The term "branch point" designates<br>
 <br>
a position of a fructose monomer, within a polyfructosc chain, to which another polyfructose chain consisting of at least two beta-2-1-linked fructose monomers, or a single fructose monomer is linked. The decree of branching is measured by Ibe method of standard methylation analysis or alternatively by the method of reductive degradation after methylation. Both methods are described in detail in the appended examples.<br>
An embodiment of the inulin of the invention which is particularly advantageous in its properties and which may include the previously described embodiments has a particularly narrow molecular weight distribution expressed by the quotient between the weight average degree of polymerization and the number average degree of polymerization DPw/DPn. This quantity is also referred to as polydispersity index. In a preferred embodiment, the quotient DPw/DPn is less than 1.25. in a more preferred embodiment is less than 1.20. in an even more preferred embodiment is less than 1.15 and in the most preferred embodiment is less than 1.10. The values for DPw and DPn are in this connection measured by the method of "gel permeation chromatography with light scattering and refractive index detection (GPC-R1-MALLS system)" described hereinafter. The molecular weight of a monomer for conversion calculations is set equal to 162 g/mol.<br>
The invention further relates to an aqueous paste of" the inulin of the invention which is obtainable by dispersing the inulin in water, shearing the resulting dispersion until homogeneous, storing the product obtained in this way at 4-15°C for 12-24 h and. after conditioning to room temperature, stirring to give a homogeneous paste. A preferred paste comprises water and 1—40% by weight, more preferably 1 - 35 % by weight, still more preferably I - 30 % by weight, even more preferably 2-25 % by weight, yet more preferably 2-20 % by weight, and particularly preferably 10-20% by weight inulin based on the total weight of the paste. The term '"paste" is according to this invention equivalent to a suspension of cristalline and/or amorphous inulin. Accordingly, the term "aqueous paste" is to be understood as a suspension of cristalline and/or amorphous inulin in aqueous phase. The aqueous phase is based on water which can optionally comprise further dissolved or suspended substances, such as salts, other carbohydrates, proteins, amino acids. In an advantageous embodiment the inulin in the paste is is a spray dried inulin. i.e. an inulin which was spray dried before forming the paste.<br>
The above described paste can be used as a component in aqueous systems. Preferred aqueous svstems are foodstuffs on aqueous basis and cosmetics, vvherin the term ..foodstuff" is defined<br>
 <br>
elsewhere in the present description. Examples of preferred foodstuffs are also listed elsewhere in the present description. In foodstuffs and cosmetics, a paste according lo the invention can be used as structure imparting component, thickening agent, texuirizing agent, stability enhancing agent or viscosity-building agent, wherein the paste in this connection can fulfil one or more of the above mentioned functions. In foodstuffs, a paste according to the invention can also be used as a fat substitute, oil substitute, prebiotic agent and/or dietary fiber component, wherein the paste in this connection can fulfil one or more of the above mentioned functions. The most preferred use is the use as an oil or fat substitute. The most preferred foodstuffs wherein a paste according to the invention is used as a component, are dairy products, such as yoghurt, yoghurt drinks, cream, creme fraiche. curd, butter, milk, especially skim milk, buttermilk, soured milk, kefir, cheese, such as cream cheese, soft cheese, sliced cheese, hard cheese, whey, milk powder, drinks on milk basis.<br>
The intilin of the invention shows a surprisingly high stability lo acid. In particular, an aqueous paste of the inuiin of the invention shows a high stability to acid. The shear stability of an aqueous inuiin paste of the invention is likewise exceptional by comparison with commercially available products.<br>
The inuiin of the invention is distinguished from other, commercially available inulins by a surprising]} high gel strength. Gel strengths of 4-100 N. more advantageous!}' 10-100 N. even more advantageously 20-100 N and most advantageously 40-100 K. are achieved at a concentration of 1 - 35 % fw'w). more preferably 1 - 30 % (w/w). still more preferably 2 - 25 % (vv\v). yet more preferably 2 - 20 % (w/w). most preferably about 20% (w/w) of the inuiin of the invention in water when inuiin is dissolved at 90°C and then stored at room temperature (23°C) for a period of 24 h. High gel strengths as indicated previously can be attained particularly well with inulins of the invention which are spray dried and then employed for ge) formation. The gels obtained in this way preferably show a particulate character (particle gels). The measurement method for determining the gel strength is described in detail in the examples section (structure formation by inulins after heating in water).<br>
The present invention relates in a further aspect to a process for obtaining inuiin in which<br>
a)	artichoke roots are comminuted<br>
b)	an extract is obtained b} treating the comminuted roots with water.<br>
c)	coloring constituents are removed from the extract obtained.<br>
 <br>
d)	inulin is precipitated from the extract.<br>
e)	the inulin is reprecrpitated at least once.<br>
The process is particularly suitable for obtaining the previously described inulins of the invention, but is not restricted thereto.<br>
Artichoke roots are used as starting material, but the process is iioi restricted to a particular variety. The comminution is advantageously preceded by removing any adherent contaminants from the roots, e.g. by vigorous washing with water with a high-pressure cleaner. It is advantageous!) possible to wash the roots in the deep-frozen state in order io minimize the loss of mass of root material.<br>
If necessary, the roots are initially comminuted coarsely, e.g. by chopping. Shredders are preferred for the further comminution. The product obtained is comminuted root material in the form of llbrous chips.<br>
In the most advantageous embodiment of the process, artichoke roots with the following characteristics are used: ripe roots with respect to the formation of dry mass and inulin. The decree of ripeness can be established from the ratio of inulin content to dry mailer content and the ratio of fructose content to inulin content. The inulin content is preferably in the range of 30 - 70 % by weight, more preferably 40 - 65 % by weight, still more preferably 50 - 60 % by weight, based on total weight of dry matter of roots, and the fructose/inulin ratio is preferably in the range of 3 - 24 % by weight, more preferably 3 - 12 % by weight, most preferably lower than 6 % by weight. The dry matter conlent of the cleaned artichoke roots is preferably 20 - 50 % by weight, more preferably 30 - 40 % by weight, more preferably 30 - 35 % by weight, based on the total weight of cleaned roots.<br>
In case that artichoke roots must be stored before using them in the process of the present invention, the roots should be conserved in order to prevent microbial contamination, rotting or decrease of molecular weight of inulin due to enzymatic degradation. Preferred methods for conservation of the roots are freezing or hot air drying of comminuted roots for storage.<br>
After the comminution, the comminuted root material is extracted with water, preferably at a temperature of 60°C to 95°C. most preferably 80-95°C. The extraction preferably takes place in<br>
 <br>
the neutral to slightly alkaline pH range. A temperature of at least 6D°C at pH 7-9 is advantageous because in this case enzymatic and acidic hydrolysis are suppressed. The concentration of comminuted rool material in the water is preferably 10-40 % b\ weight, more preferably 20 - 30 % hy weight, measured as fresh weight of roots based on the total weight of the extraction mixture.<br>
PrcferabK a ratio between the dry matter of the shredded material used and the water as extraction medium is established which leads to a dry matter content in the extract of 8 - 12 % by weight and an inulin content of more than 6 % by weight, preferably 6 - 8 % by weight, based on the weight of the extract. A correspondingly suitable choice of extraction conditions, such as the ratio of water to root weight, can lead to a transfer of 80 - 90 % b\ weight of the inulin present in the mots into the extract. The aforementioned conditions are suitable lo achieve a favorable crystallization and a high yield of the inulin from the extract, based on the observation that the high molecular weight inulin crystallizes from the extract even at a concentration as low as 5% by weight, based on the weight of the extract.<br>
There is no special restriction on the extraction equipment, and conventional extraction techniques for plant material can be applied. It is most preferred according lo the in\ ention for the extraction to take place in a jacket-heated extractor with agitator, in another highly preferred embodiment a beatable lauter tun is used as stirred extractor. Thus, the extraction of the inulin from the roots is combined with the separation of the extract from the spent chips by filtration, as described below. The extraction time after equilibration of the root/water mixture is preferably 30 min - 4 hours, preferably 1-2 hours. After ibis time, the extract is separated from (he spent chips, e.g. by pumping off or straining off or filtration.<br>
After separation of the extract from the spent chips, where appropriate, fibrous materials and plant fragments may remain as suspended materials in the extract. If present, these suspended materials are likewise removed from the extract. In this variant of the process, step b) of the process is thus followed, before step c). by a step in which suspended materials, mainly consisting of fibers, are removed from the extract. The acceptable amount of suspended materials and whether removal is to take place will be decided b\ the skilled worker from case to case. Removal of the suspended materials can take place b\ conventional separation techniques, as centrifugation or filtration. A desludging separator has proved particularly suitable. A screen or filter with appropriate fineness can also be used.<br>
 <br>
In a highly preferred embodiment, the suspended material can be filtered off bv using the spent chips as a filler material, in this embodiment the spent chips are precipitated at the bottom of the extraction vessel equipped with a sieve at the bottom, like a lauter tun. The sieve is preferably a slit sieve. The precipitated spent chips are used as a filtration bed through which the extract flows. By using this technique a nearl\ quantitative removal of suspended material is possible without using further filtration steps before further refining or brightening the extract or crystallizing the inulin.<br>
The extracts are colored owing 10 their content of coloring constituents and colloidal!} suspended colorized matter. The coloring constituents consist, inter alia, of tannins and flavanotds and usually confer a yellow or brownish yellow and/or dark brownish color on (he extract. The inulins which can be obtained directly from such extracts do not comply with the desired requirements concerning a neutral color. It is therefore necessary to remove the coloring constituents from the extract in step c) of the process. Process step c) of the invention for removing coloring constituents from plant extracts is generally also referred to as decolonization, clarification or "brightening" of plant extracts. These terms are equivalent in the context of the present invention.<br>
The brightening can take place according to the invention by adding lime and subsequent carbonalion (CO: addition). The process of lime addition is known from the prior art and is used for example in obtaining sucrose from sugar beet. In an alternative brightening process, the interfering constituents are removed using an ion exchanger.<br>
In a particularly advantageous embodiment of the process, the coloring constituents are removed in step cj by<br>
i)   admixing magnesium ions (Mg~+) to the plant extract.<br>
ii)  admixing at least one alkaline component to the plant extract.<br>
iii) forming a precipitate, and<br>
iv) removing the precipitate which has formed from the plant extract.<br>
Steps i) - iv) in this particularly preferred variant are substeps of process step c).<br>
 <br>
This process variant surprising!) makes more effective decolorization of the extract possible compared with the lime brightening process. In addition, the auxiliaries employed, magnesium salts and alkalis, are low-cost. The process is thus less costl) than the use of an ion exchanger. The expenditure on apparatus and time for carrying out this process step is also particular!) low. Finally, this type of brightening aiso simultaneously removes materials causing turbidity from the extract.<br>
Magnesium ions (Mg2') are admixed according to the invention to the aqueous plant extract, ft is possible in a variant of step i) to add an aqueous solution of a magnesium salt to the plant extract. In a further, more preferred variant, a magnesium salt is added directly in solid form to the plant extract and dissolved therein.<br>
If a magnesium salt is added, it is preferably a salt which, owing-to its high solubility product, is very readily soluble in water. Particularly suitable magnesium salts are selected from magnesium chloride, magnesium sulfate, magnesium nitrate, magnesium salts of lower fatty acids such as magnesium acetate and propionate, and mixtures thereof.<br>
An alkaline component in ii) means according to the invention a component which comprises hydroxide ions (OH") or forms hydroxide ions in the extract after combining with the plant extract. The alkaline component may be liquid, solid or gaseous. A liquid alkaline component is preferably employed.<br>
On addition of magnesium ions and an alkaline component as described in steps i) and ii) of the process, a precipitate is formed by a precipitation reaction. Steps i) and ii) can in the context of the present process in principle be carried out simultaneous!), especially ii' a solution of magnesium ions is used in step i) and an alkaline liquid is used in step ii). However, it is preferred to carry out process step i) first and then step ii).<br>
It is advantageous for process step c) that both the magnesium ions and the alkaline component are distributed as homogeneously as possible in the extract so that the precipitation reaction in the extract is also homogeneous and as quantitative as possible. It is therefore preferred to employ as alkaline component aqueous alkaline liquids such as. for exampie. alkaline solutions or alkaline suspensions which can be rapidly and homogeneously mixed into the plant extract. An alkaline solution or suspension comprises according to the invention hydroxide ions (OIF) or<br>
 <br>
forms them after combining with the plant extract.<br>
In a vciy preferred process variant, a magnesium salt is homogeneous!) dissolved in the extract first in step i). Subsequently, in step ii). an aqueous alkaline solution or suspension is added.<br>
Jn one embodiment, (he alkaline component is an aqueous solution or suspension of an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal hydroxide. The hydroxide is preferably selected from the hydroxides of the alkali metals and alkaline earth metals, such as lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide and barium hydroxide.<br>
In a very particularly preferred variant, the alkaline component is a suspension of calcium hydroxide. The advantage of using calcium hydroxide is that a particularly small amount of centrifugate is obtained in step iii). In addition, the simultaneous precipitation of magnesium hydroxide and calcium sulfate achieves a greater sedimentation rate and a greater compressibility of the precipitate. The precipitate has particularly little gelatinous consistency. The binding of inulin in the precipitate thus remains particularly low in this process variant.<br>
A further alkaline component which can be used is ammonia, preferably in aqueous solution. Nor is it excluded in principle to use gaseous ammonia, but this is less preferred than die use of an aqueous solution.<br>
In a further embodiment, the alkaline component is an aqueous solution or suspension of an organic base such as cthylenediamine and triethanolamine.<br>
Salts of weak organic acids such as alkali metal and alkaline earth metal acetates, especially sodium acetate, potassium acetate, calcium acetate and magnesium acetate, can also be used.<br>
Magnesium hydroxide is formed as precipitate. The coloring constituents of the aqueous extract remain according to the invention in the precipitate and are thus separated from the liquid phase. A substantially decolorized extract is obtained. The amounts of Mg~T ions and alkaline component employed, and thus the amount of precipitate formed, determine inter alia how quantitative the decoloriz-ation is. Optimization of the amounts of the reactants is within the competence of a skilled worker. In case of magnesium sulfate, the preferable concentration is in the range of 0.5 - 3 % by weight, more preferably 0.5 - 2 % by weight of the aqueous extract.<br>
 <br>
in the preS'ervcd vaiianl of step c). as described above, the molar ratio of hydroxide ions to magnesium ions OH~:Mg~~ is preferably from 2.2:1 ui 1.8:1. It is most preferred lor the ratio to be exactly stoichiometric, i.e. OH":Mtr+ = 2:1. The amount of alkaline component is thus to be chosen so that the appropriate amount of hydroxide ions is present for the magnesium ions.<br>
The dissolving of the magnesium salt and admixing of the alkaline component in process steps i) and ii) preferably takes place with stirring in order to achieve dissolution and homogenization as quickly as possible and thus a fast reaction, 1 lowever. there are no particular further restrictions on the mixing technique. Thus, the process can be carried out for example also by other mixing techniques familiar to (lie skilled worker.<br>
To expedite the process, step i) is preferably carried out at a temperature of 60-80°C. The reaction time after addition of the alkaline component is generally from about 1 to 15 min. averaging about 10 min.<br>
The removal step iv) preferably lakes place by sedimentation or filtration. The sedimentation can be made faster by a centrifuge, preferably a disk centrifuge, in particular a desfudging centrifuge. However, other separation techniques familiar to the skilled worker can also be used. These can also be carried out in combination with one another, e.g. centrifugal desludging of the brightened extract with subsequent filtration of the desludged extract, e.g. with a plate filter.<br>
The whole of step c) of the process of the invention may if required also be carried out more than once. If the previously described preferred variant of step c) with substeps i) - iv) is used, it is also possible for the individual subsieps j)- iv) to be carried out more than once.<br>
After step c). inulin is precipitated from the extract in step d). The precipitation can be effected for example by adding alcohols such as ethanol, methanol or isopropanol. In this case, depending on the amount of alcohol added or adjusted polarity of the liquid phase, initially high molecular weight inulin fractions are precipitated, so that it is possible to influence, via the amount of alcohol added, how quantitatively the inulin present in the extract is precipitated and which molecular weight fractions are predominantly obtained. Besides alcohol, it is also possible to employ other nonpolar organic liquids which are miscible with water.<br>
 <br>
For this purpose, in a particular^ advantageous embodiment of this process step, to limit the use of alcohol. especialK ethanol and isopropanol. the prepared extract is initially concentrated, preferabh to one fourth lo one fifth of its initial volume. The concentration can take place b\ evaporation or membrane filtration and a combination of both processes. Care must be taken in this case that the concentrate is kept hot during the concentration, preferably at 60-95°C. in order to avoid precipitation of the inulin. An advantage of membrane filtration is the depletion, associated therewith, in low molecular weight substances accompanying the inulin. The subsequent precipitation of the inulin from the concentrate can be managed by Ihe choice of increasing alcohol concentration so that the inulin is fractionated according lo molecular size ranges which are characterized for example by the weight average degree of polymerization (DPw). Depending on the choice of the precipitation conditions, the result is fractions which have the DPw according to the invention. Depending on the desired purity.<br>
It is more preferred to obtain inulin by cooling the extract than by alcoholic precipitation. The preferred conditions are such that the extract is cooled to a temperature of 2 - 10°C. more preferably 2 - 8°C\ and kept at this temperature over a period of from 6 to 140 h. preferably 6 to 48 h, during which the inulin precipitates. The cooling rate and temperature, and the duration of [he cooling influence the precipitation of the inulin from the extract and the breadth of ihe molecular weight distribution and thus at the same time the quantity. Choice of a longer period and lower temperature results in precipitation of more low molecular weight inulins and a broader molecular weight distribution and thus a lower average molecular weight of the precipitated fraction. The precipitated inulin is separated from the liquid phase by conventional separation techniques such as. for example, centrifugation. decantation. filtration.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, inulin is crystallized for the first time after the extraction step b) and before step c) of the above described process. Such crystallisation is preferably done as described previously. Crystallisation before step c) leads to an increase in the yield of high molecular weight inulin compared with direct brightening of the extract, and economizes the use of the brightening agents, i.e. magnesium compound and the alkaline component. It is advantageous to brighten the extract after the first crystallisation of the inulin as in this case only the coloring constituents bound to the inulin crystals have to be removed, which leads to a similarly smaller amount of inulin bound to the brightening sludge.<br>
 <br>
A first precipitation and removal of the precipitated inulin can be followed by renewed cooling of the extract or addition of alcohol in order to obtain any inulin fractions which are still dissolved. A decision about repetition is made from case to case according to how quantitative!) the inulin is to be obtained from the plants and what molecular weight distribution in the final product is desired.<br>
The inulin concentration in the extract depends substantial!;' on the inulin content of the roots and the concentration of the comminuted roots in the extract and is a further variable which has an effect on the precipitation of the inulin by cooling the extract. The dependence of the precipitation on the concentration can therefore be utilized in order to concentrate the liquid phase after the first precipitation, e.g. by evaporation, in order also to precipitate the low molecular weight fractions if this is desired.<br>
In the last process step e). the precipitated inulin is reprecipitated. "Reprecipitation" means in the context of this invention that the solid inulin. resulting from the previous process step, is redissolved find then precipitated and/or crystallized out of the solution again. Thus, process step e) can also be worded as: the inulin is dissolved and precipitated and'or crystallized again, wherein this step is done at least once. The crystallization differs from the precipitation in that predominant!} crystalline structures are obtained.<br>
The inulin is preferably dissolved under the influence of heat and preferably in water. Water with a temperature of 70-100°C. in particular 90-100°C. is particularly suitable.<br>
The precipitation in step e) can take place by alcoholic precipitation as previously described. However, the inulin is preferably obtained by cooling the solution to 2 - 10°C. more preferably 2-8°C, over a period of 6 to 140 h. preferably 6 to 48 h.<br>
The precipitation of the inulin dissolved in step e) can be repeated in order to obtain the inulin still remaining in the liquid phase. A decision about repetition is to be made from case to case according to how quantitatively the inulin is to be obtained from the plants and what molecular weight distribution in the final product is desired. The liquid phase can be concentrated in order to simplify the precipitation.<br>
 <br>
After reprecipitalion. the resulting inulin solid is separated from the liquid phase by conventional separation techniques such as. for example, cemrifugation. decantation. filtration.<br>
In order to influence the molecular mass distribution and purity of the resulting inulin product, process step e) can be carried out more than once. It has emerged that the averages of the molecular weigh! and the averages of the degree of polymerization are shifted to higher values, on repetition of the reprecipitalion step e). It is thus possible to set various averages of the molecular weight/degree of polymerization of the inulin of the invention within the claimed range.<br>
If fine-particle impurities are still present, it is advantageous to insert one or more filtration steps into the process. Any fine-particle impurities present are removed in the filtration. The fineness of the filter is chosen by the skilled worker depending on the particle size of the impurity.<br>
The filtration step(s) can be inserted anywhere in the process after obtaining the extract. A filtration step dircctK after obtaining the extract in step b) for example is advantageous. The filtration step is to be distinguished from the removal of suspended materials as described previousl). because the particles removed by the filtration are finer than the suspended materials, which consist mainly of fibers. In a further preferred embodiment, the filtration step is carried out before step d).<br>
The iiltration step is preferably comhined with a reprecipitation as described for process step e). This entails the inuh'n being dissolved as previously described for step e). and the solution then being filtered. After the filtration, the inulin is precipitated or crystallized out of the filtered solution. The solid inulin resulting after the precipitation or crystallization can be separated from the liquid phase by conventional separation techniques, such as. for example, cemrifugation. decantation and filtration.<br>
In some cases the resulting inulin can be discolored by substances which can not be removed by filtration, in such cases it is preferred to remove the coloring impurities by a treatment with activated carbon. In one embodiment active charcoal is suspended in water and added to an muYm .solution at a temperature of above 8Q'C. preferably above O0°C. In case of a 20 % by weight inulin solution the amount of active carbon is preferably in a range of 1 - 10 % by weight, preferably 2-6 % by weight, more preferably 2 - 3 % by weight, based on the weight of<br>
 <br>
the inulin solution. After adsorption of the coloring impurities, the activated carbon is removed by centrifugal ion and'or filtration. The activated-carbon suspension can be preclarified by centrifugal separation of the activated-carbon sludge and then clarified b\ two-stage filtration, for example with a combination of a kieselguhr precoat filter and a sheet filter. It is important that during the separation of the active charcoal from the inulin solution the temperature is maintained above 80°C. preferably above 90°C. in order to keep the inulin in solution. After removal of the active charcoal, the inulin can be precipitaled or crystallized and separated from the liquid phase as described above.<br>
After separation from the liquid phase, the final product can be washed again with water or a water/alcohol mixture. Washing with cold water at a temperature of2-10°C is preferred. For this purpose, the inulin precipitate is slurried in water and the inulin is then sedimented again.<br>
The resulting inulin is preferably dried in a further, last process step. The drying can take place by freeze drying, sprav drying or drum drying.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the inulin of the invention is in spray-dried form. Suitable spray-drying parameters are described in the appended examples, it is self evident that in case of a spray drying process a precipitated or crystallized inulin must be brought into suspension (in water below about 80°C) or into solution (in water above about 80°C) again. Alternatively, a last precipitation or crystallization step, as described above, can be omitted and the suspended or dissolved inulin from the process can directly be spray dried. It is possible by adding spray-dried inulins of the invention to liquid prepared food products for the viscosity to be increased particularly effectively. On addition of equal quantities of inulin of the invention, a greater increase in viscosity is achieved with a spray-dried inulin compared with an inulin dried in another way (e.g. freeze drying).<br>
In yet a further preferred embodiment, the inulin of the invention is in spray-granulated form. Spray-granulated inulin is obtained by known processes, e.g. by introducing a previously spray-dried material as granulation seed and spray drying further inulin. An inulin with a particle size of 10-100 urn for example can serve as initial charge. Suitable spray-granulation conditions are for example a feed composition of 70% water and 30% inulin and a feed temperature of 90°C.<br>
The inulin of the invention very particularly preferably has an average particle diameter of<br>
 <br>
50-350 Lim. more preferably 80-300 jam. even more preferably 100-250 itm and most preferably 100-200 urn. Such an inulin is thus a further aspect of this invention.<br>
The average particle diameter can be determined both by sieve analysis of a dr\ sample and by light scattering. The preferred method is. however, sieve analysis so that the inulin of the invention preferably has an average particle diameter of 50-350 u.m. more preferabh 80-300 p.m. even more preferably 100-250 um and most preferably 100-200 um. determined bv sieve analysis.<br>
In one embodiment, the inulin of the invention having the described particle sizes is obtained by spray-drying or spra\-granulation process. A spray-dried or spray-granulated inulin having the previously described panicle sizes is thus a further aspect of this invention.<br>
It is possible to adjust the preferred average particle diameter of a dried inulin by means of sieve fractionation in the event that, after drying, it is still outside the preferred range. Selection of the suitable sieve size lies within the competence of the average skilled worker.<br>
The inulin particles of the invention preferably have a crystalline fraction of less than 45%. more preferably less than 40%. even more preferabK' less than 35%. In a further preferred embodiment, less than 20%. even more preferably less than 10%. In the most preferred embodiment, the degree of crystallinity is less than 1%. The stated degrees of crystallinity are determined h&gt; the method of Ruland-Vonk (W. Ruland. Acta Cryst.. 34. 1180 (1961): C.G. Vonk. .1. Appl. Cryst. 6. 148 (1973)). The method for determining the degree of crystallinity is described in detail in the appended examples. A low degree of crystallinity confers better dissolving properties on the inulin. which is advantageous in certain foodstuff applications.<br>

 <br>
Examples<br>
General methods<br>
1.	Fructan determination<br>
1.1       Fructan determination by hydrolysis with exoinulinase<br>
The inulin solutions to be measured are prepared by weighing 50.0 -7- 5.0 mg of inulin accurately into a I ml graduated flask. 700 u.1 of dd HiO are added to dissolve. The sample is then shaken in order to detach the sample material as well as possible from the base of the vessel, and is then placed in an almost boiling waterbath (~99°C) for 8 min. During the incubation, the graduated flask is shaken every 30 seconds. After the incubation, the sample is allowed to cool to room temperature and is then made up to the 1 ml mark with dd HiO. The sample solution has an inulin concentration of 5.0 +/- 0.5%.<br>
For sugar determination before the digestion. 200 u.1 are removed and frozen at -20°C. Before ihe sugar measurement, this sample is thawed at room temperature, mixed, dissolved b\ shaking at 1400 rpm in a heating block at 95°C for 5 min. and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 2 min. For the hydrolysis. 50 ul of the approx. 5% strength inulin solution are put into the digestion mix consisting of 50 ul of 1M Ma citrate pH 4.6. 25 u.1 of exo-inulinase (Megazyme International Ireland Ltd. Wicklow. Ireland, article No. E-EXOl, 2.5 U/ul) and 375 ul of dd H:0. The digestion is mixed and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for I min. The digestion is then incubated on a healing block at 40°C for 4 h. All digested samples are frozen at -20°C. Before the sugar measurement, these samples are thawed at room temperature, mixed and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 2 min. For the fructose measurement, a 1:10 dilution is prepared by adding 10 ul of digestion to90fdofddH2O.<br>
To determine the fructose and glucose liberated in the digestion, a photometric measurement of glucose and fructose is carried out in all the samples as described under "sugar determination (glucose, fructose, sucrose)". Besides glucose and fructose, also sucrose is determined in the sample before the digestion.<br>
The undiluted 5% strength inulin solution is used for sugar measurement before the digestion. 10 ul of this solution are added to 200 ul of measurement buffer. For glucose measurement in the digested samples. 10 u.1 of the undiluted samples are added to 200 ul of measurement buffer. For<br>
 <br>
fructose measurement in the digested samples. 10 ul of samples diluted 1:10 are added to 200 u.1<br>
.if measurement buffer.<br>
The calculation is based, as in the sugar determination, on a molar extinction coefficient of<br>
5.23 l*mmof *cm"' for the conversion of NADP to NADPH. The concentration of glucose and<br>
fructose present before the digestion is subtracted from the glucose and fructose concentrations<br>
in the digested samples. Likewise, the glucose and fructose which would be liberated from<br>
liydroiyzed sucrose present in the sample before the digestion is subtracted.<br>
The concentrations of fructose and glucose formed during the digestion of inulin are then<br>
obtained. The fructan content is obtained by addition of the glucose and fructose contents and<br>
with inclusion of the factor 162/180 for conversion of the measured free hexoses into the hexoses<br>
bound in the fructan.<br>
2.  Sugar determination (glucose, fructose and sucrose)<br>
The glucose, fructose and sucrose contents were determined by photometry in an enzymatic assay via conversion of NADP'* (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) to NADPH (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide). The aromatic character of the nicotinamide ring is lost in the reduction, and thus the absorption spectrum is changed. This change in the absorption spectrum can be detected by photometry<br>
Glucose and fructose are converted by means of the enzyme hexokinase and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) into glucose 6-phosphate and fructose 6-phosphate. The glucose 6-phosphate is then oxidized by the enzyme gIucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase to 6-phosphogluconate. NADP" is reduced to NADPH in this reaction, and the amount of NADPH formed is measured by photometry. The ratio of NADPH formed to the glucose present in the extract is 1:1. so that the glucose content can be calculated from the NADPH content using the molar extinction coefficient of NADPH (6.23 I mmol"' cm"1) according to Lambert-Beer's law. After the oxidation of the glucose 6-phosphate is complete, the fructose 6-phosphate which is likewise produced in the solution is converted by the enzyme phosphogiucoisomera.se into glucose 6-phosphate. which in turn is oxidized to 6-phosphogluconate. The ratio of fructose and the amount of NADPH formed is also 1:1. The fructose content is calculated from the amount of NADPH formed, as described for glucose.<br>
Subsequently, the sucrose present in the extract is cleaved by the enzyme sucrose (from Megazyme) into glucose and fructose. The liberated glucose and fructose molecules are then<br>
 <br>
converted by the abovementioned enzymes in the NADP -dependent reaction into 6-phosphogluconate. Two molecules of NADPM are formed in the conversion of one molecule of sucrose into 6-phosphogluconate. The amount of NADPH formed is likewise measured b\ photomctr\. and the sucrose content is calculated therefrom using the molar extinction coefficient of NADPM.<br>
A 5% strength inulin solution as described under "Fructan determination by hydrolysis with exo-inulinase" is used for the sugar measurement. 10 ul of this solution are added to 200 pi of measurement buffer. The measurement takes place as duplicate determination in microliter plates using the SPECTRAmax photometers (Molecular Devices). All the enzyme solutions used are made up in measurement buffer consisting of 50 mM imidazole HC1 pH 6.9. 2.5 mM MgCk ImM ATP and 0.4 mM NADP. The conversion of NADP to NADPH is followed at a wavelength of 340 nm.<br>
The glucose determination takes place by adding 2 ul of a mix of hexokinase (from yeast. 0.3 U/ul) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (from yeast, 0.14 U/|il). After conversion of the glucose is complete. 2 ul of phosphoglucose isomerase (from yeast. 0.14 U/u.]) are added to determine fructose. When the fructose is complete!)' converted. 2 ul of sucrasc (from Megaxyme. 0.2U'u!i are added lo cleave the sucrose present. The calculation of glucose, fructose and sucrose takes place as described.<br>

After brief cooling, the inulin solution is diluted to 0.1% with eluent (100 pi of inulin solution + 900 pi of eluent) and immediately placed in [he autosampler at 60°C. The polymers are analyzed using the following apparatus: Dionex P580 pump, Dionex AS50 autosampler. Dionex model 585 column oven (Dionex GmbH. Idstein. Germany).

The polymers are fractionated on a PSS GRAM. 10 p. precolumn and the PSS GRAM 3000. 10 u and PSS GRAM 100. 10 p separation columns (PSS Polymer Standards Service GmbH. Mainz. Germany). 50 pi of the 0.1% inulin solution are injected for the analysis. The fractionation takes place in the column oven at a temperature of 60°C and with a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min with the eluent DMSO+90mM NaN03. To determine the molecular masses, the system is calibrated with the following dextran standards (product No. 31430. Fluka Riedel-deHaen. Scclze. Germany): dextran Tl (Mw 1270). T5 (Mw 5220). '112 (Mw 11 600). T25 Mw 23 800). T50 (Mw 48 600). ] 80 (Mw  80 900).  T150 (Mw   147 600). T270 (Mw 273 000). T410 (Mw  409 800)  T670<br>

Determination of the water content<br>
 <br>
The water content is determined using an AQUA 40.00 Karl-Fischer titrator (from analytikjena AG). Fhdranal-Coulomat AG (Riedel-deMacn. article No. 34 836) is used as anolytc. The reference substance used is dibasic sodium tartrate dihydrate (Riedel-deHaen. article No. 32 323) with a moisture content of 15.61-15.71%. 10-20 mg of sample are weighed into 5 ml sample bottles (N20-5DIN. Machery-Nagel. article No. 702 04.36). the bottles are closed with crimped caps (N20 TS/oA, Machery-Nagel. article No. 702 815). and the water content of the sample is determined using the Karl-Fischer titrator.<br>

5.1	Permethylation<br>
(according to Ciucanu and Kerek / Ciucanu. I. &amp; Kerek. F. (1984) A simple and rapid method for the permethylation of carbohydrates. Carbohydr. Res. 131. 209-217.)<br>
About 50 mg of sample are dissolved in 2.5 ml of dimethyl sulfoxide. Then 3 eq/OH of finely ground sodium hydroxide and 3 eq/OH of methyl iodide are added and stirred at room temperature for 24 hours. Then half the amount of each of the reagents is added once again. The samples are subsequently dialyzed against distilled water for four days (dialysis membrane Spectra/Por MWCO 3500. Spectrum Laboratories. Rancho Dominguez. CA. USA) and freeze dried. The completeness of the methylation is checked by ATR-IR spectroscopy. The OH stretching vibration in the range 3300-3400 cm"1 should have disappeared if there is permethylation.<br>
5.2	Standard methylation analysis<br>
Hydrolysis<br>
About  2  mg of permethviated  inuiin  are mixed in a   I   ml  V vial  with  0.9 mi of 0.5 M<br>
 <br>
trifluoroacetic acid and hydrolyzed b\ stirring at 90°C for one hour. After the solution has cooled it is evaporated to dryness in a stream of nitrogen. Trichloroacetic acid residues arc removed bv codisiillation with toluene.<br>
Reduction<br>
The hydrolyzed sample is mixed with 500 ul of a 0.5 M NaB04 solution in 2 M Nllj and heated at 60°C for one hour. After cooling, excess sodium borohydrite is decomposed h\ adding a few drops of glacial acetic acid. Resulting borate is removed by codistillation with 15% strength methanolic acetic acid.<br>
Acetyl ali on<br>
The partially methylated sugar alcohols resulting from the reduction are mixed with 200 ul of acetic anhydride and 50 ul of pyridine and acetylated at 90°C for 2 hours. The solution is cooled and then saturated sodium bicarbonate solution is added until no further gas formation is to be observed. It is then extracted four times with 15 ml of dichloromethane each time. The combined organic phases are washed twice with 15 ml of saturated NaHCOj solution each time, once with 20 ml of cold 0.1 M HCJ and once with 25 ml of distilled water. The solution is then dried over calcium chloride and concentrated in vacuo, and taken up in dichloromethane for the GC measurement.<br>
5.3 Reductive degradation<br>
About 1 mg of the permethylated sample is dissolved in 500 ul of dichloromethane in a screw-cap glass vial, mixed with 6 eq/glycoside bond on triethylsilane and 4 eq of TMS triflate and stirred at room temperature for 2 hours. After addition of 20 pi of acetic anhydride, stirring is continued at room temperature for 2 hours. The reaction is then stopped h\ adding saturated aqueous NaHCOi solution, and stirring is continued for 1 hour. Working up takes place by extraction with dichloromethane and subsequent washing of the combined organic phases with saturated aqueous NaHCC&gt;3 solution and distilled water. The solution is finally dried over calcium chloride, concentrated in a stream of nitrogen and taken up in dichloromethane for the GC measurement.<br>
 <br>
5.4 Qualitative and quantitative analysis<br>
The degradation products were anahzed quantitative!; by gas chromalograph\ with on-column injection and llame ionization detector (FID). The peak areas were corrected according to their effective carbon response. The peaks were assigned on the basis of their mass spectrum (GC'-MS) and the rcicnlion times of known comparison samples.<br>
6.	Differential scanning calorimetry of inulin<br>
40 ml of a 15% strength <w inulin solution were prepared in ml graduated polypropylene tubes x mm. from greiner. order number this was done by adding the respective powder to double-distilled water and shaking. subsequently all suspensions are placed a waterbath dissolved shaking several times. after minutes it is established visually that have completely dissolved. solutions then divided equal parts two immediately deep frozen liquid nitrogen. freeze dried for days content about ground mortar.></w>
The water content of the samples is determined using an automatic Karl-Fischer litrator (see general methods 4),<br>
For a DSC measurement, about 10 mg of inulin dry substance are weighed into a stainless steel crucible (volume 50 pi), the exact weight is found, and 30 pi of distilled water are added. The crucibles are then hermetically sealed. An empty stainless steel crucible is used as reference. The sample is heated in a DSC apparatus with autosampler (Perkin Elmer: Diamond) from 10-160X at a heating rate of 10oC/minutes. The data analysis is carried out by the PYRTS 7.0 software program (Perkin Elmer. 63110 Rodgau-JUgesheim. Germany), This entailed determination of T() (onset) and the free enthalpy dH.<br>
7.	Viscosity determination<br>
Aqueous inulin solutions of various concentrations (weight per volume of distilled water) were prepared by shaking at 98QC. and the clear solutions were measured immediately after a dissolvin time not exceediim 13 min. The measurements were carried out in a BOH1.IN Gemini<br>
 <br>
Advanced Rheometer (Malvern Instruments; Herrenberg. German)) using the isothermal (90°C) viscometry mode on a CP4o/40 mm cone-plate system. The measuring gap was covered with a la\CT of extra light paraffin oil. A shear rate of 10 s"1 for 60 s with a 10 s relaxation lime was used for prehearing. The shearing was measured in logarithmic steps in a shear rate mode. The initial shear rate was 20 s" . the final shear rate was 30 s'1 in an increasing ramp with a holdup lime of 20 s an an integration lime of 10 s. The data are based on the average values in the range from 20 s~ to 30 s" and are the means of three independent measurements per data point. All measurements specified as outliers are not included in the average values. The definition of "outlier" took place by the so-called "quartile method". This entailed outliers being specified as all measurements lying outside the range criterion Q2 - k*(Q.i-Qi) 
8. Determination of gel strength and viscoelastic behavior<br>
70 g of a 17% by weight suspension of inulin in water (distilled) was put into an MV measuring cup of a Haakc Roiovisco VT 550 viscometer. A paddle stirrer was then inserted and mounted in the preheated (90°C. heating jacket) apparatus. The mixture was then heated with stirring at 128 rpm for 15 min.<br>
After 15 min. the mixture was transferred at 90°C into a container which consisted of a base and a wall composed of two cylindrical rings of acrylic sheet (each 20 mm high. 30 mm diameter) which were placed one on top of the other and were fastened together by means of an adhesive tape (19 mm wide). The mixture was introduced into the container without bubbles until the level was about 5 mm below the upper edge. The container was then hermetically covered with an aluminum foil and left to stand at room temperature (23°C) overnight.<br>
The gel strength was measured after storage at room temperature (23°C) for about 20 hours using a TA XT2 texture analyzer. To make measurement of the gel strength possible on a smooth, undricd surface, firstly the adhesive tape which held the two cylindrical rings of the container together was removed. The gel was then divided with a razorblade between the rings so that the lower part of the gel exhibited a smooth surface.<br>
 <br>
The gel strength was measured with the TA XT2 texture analyzer by a level dome (diameter 24.5 mm) penetrating (1 mm) into the gel. I he sellings on the texture analyzer were as follows:<br>
Measurement principle:	force in direction of pressure<br>
Forward speed:	2 mnv's<br>
Test speed:	2 ram's<br>
Trigger value:	0.01 N<br>
Reverse speed:	2 mm/s<br>
Travel:	1 mm<br>
The maximum value with a single penetration of the dome in newtons is indicated.<br>

Example 1 Characterization of the inulin from artichoke roots<br>
1.	Cultivation of the artichoke plants<br>
The artichoke plants of the Madrigal variety were grown in the vicinity of Valencia. Spain. The seeds were sown in April 2005. and the plants were harvested in August/September 2005. The roots were separated from the above-ground part, freed of adherent soil and dried. The roots were then transported without cooling from Spain to Germany. The roots were stored at -20°C until the inulin was extracted.<br>
2.	Inulin preparation from artichoke roots<br>
Roots from artichoke plants of the Madrigal variety about 4-5 months old are used to prepare the inulin. 60 kg of roots are freed of the soil constituents adhering to them by washing in the deep-frozen stage with a high-pressure cleaner (Karcher. Winnenden. type HD 700) before they arc further processed to chips in a shredder (Gloria Universal garden shredder natura 28001-1. The chips are put into a jacket-heated exlracter with gate agitator containing water preheated to 70-90X. The total amount of water added is 180 kg. The pH of the extract is adjusted to 9.0 by adding NaOH. After rapid heating of the chip mash to 80-85cC via the jacket of the extractor, the mash is agitated at 8G-85CC for about 60 mm in order to extract (he inulin (fructan) from the chips. After this time, crude extract is separated from the chips by pumping off.<br>
The crude extract is decolorized in a two-stage process by forming a total of 0.7 g of Mg(OH2)/100ml of extract. In the first stage. 3400 g of MgS04 * 7 H20 (equivalent to 0.5 g of Mg(OHi)/100 ml of extract) are dissolved in 170 J- of dark-brown colored extract with stirring over the course of 10 min. Subsequently. 1015 g of 96% strength Ca(OH)i are added as suspension in 3 I. of water and stirred for 10 min. A pH of 9.4 is set up. The whole precipitation mixture is quantitatively clarified in a plate separator (GEA. Westfalia type SC 6-06-076) over the course of 120 min. The decolorized extraction solution has a pale yellow color and is free of materials causing turbidity. A solid phase in the form of a thick paste is obtained as removed sludge fraction. The entire decolorization step is repeated on the extraction solution obtained in this way and comprising 150 1. with MgS04 * 7 H;&gt;0 (equivalent to 0.2 g Mg(OH:)/)00 ml of<br>
 <br>
extract) and 410 g of 06% strength Ca(OH); as suspension in 1.5 L of water. The whole precipitation mixture i.s quantitatively clarified in a plate separator o\er the course of 30 nvn. The decolorized extraction solution with a pl-1 of 9,4 is clear, has a pale yellow color and is free of materials causing turbidity, A centrifugate of 71 in the form of a thick paste is again obtained as sludge fraction.<br>
Solid inulin is obtained from the extract brightened in this way by cooling at a temperature of 4°C over a period of 48 h. Ths inulin is obtained as sludge-like sediment by centrifugal deposition using the plate separator.<br>
The sediment is further purified twice in succession in the same concentration as present in the brightened extract by dissolving the inulin in hot water and renewed precipitation by storage at 2°C for 48 h. The inulin sediment obtained after the second precipitation is freeze dried.<br>
Figure 1 shows a diagrammatic representation of the progress of the extraction.<br>
During the extraction process, the polymer distribution was analyzed after the individual extraction and purification steps by gel permeation chromatography with refactor index detection and calibration with dextran standards (GPC'-RI system, see Method 3.2 in "General Methods"). As evident from Figure 2. the polymer distribution of extract (B) after the hot-water extraction is comparable to that in the washed roots (A). Figure 2 shows a GPC-Rl analysis of the polymer distribution in the washed artichoke roots (A) and the extract after the hot-water extraction of inulin (B).<br>
Analysis of the polymer distribution after the cold (4°C) precipitation of the inulin showed that a high molecular weight inulin fraction (C) was separated from a low molecular weight fraction (D) (Figure 3). Figure 3 shows a GPC-RI analysis of the polymer distribution in the extract after the hot-water extraction of inulin (B). in the sediment after the inulin precipitation al4°C (Oand in the upper run obtained after centrifugation of the inulin after precipitation (D).<br>
A further enrichment of high molecular weight inulin and a depletion of low molecular weight substances, especially mono- and disaccharides. were achieved by reprecipitation of the high molecular weight inulin fraction (Figure 4). Figure 4: GPC-Rl analysis o\" the polymer distribution in the inulin precipitated at 4%" (C). in the sediment after the reprecipitation (F&gt; and in clear phase after the reprecipitation (E).<br>
 <br>
3. Determination of the purity of the prepared inulin<br>
The puril\ of the prepared artichoke inulin obtained in section 2 was determined b\ determining<br>
the fructan and water contents of the freeze-dried material. The water content determined for the<br>
artichoke inulin was 1.7% (see method "Determination of the water content").<br>
The fructan content was determined by hydrolyzing the inulin with the enzyme exo-inulinase<br>
(see method "Fructan determination by hydrolysis with exoinuiinase"). The purity based on dry<br>
matter (DM) was found from the fructan content and the water content. Purity    = fructan<br>
content x 100 / (100 - water content)<br>
As is evident from Table I. the average degree of purity of the prepared artichoke inulin is 97%<br>
of the dry matter (DM 1.<br>

4. Molecular weight determination by GPC-R1-MALLS<br>
0.5% (wA) aqueous solutions were prepared from the purified artichoke inulin obtained in section 2. and from purchased reference samples of Raftiline HP (from Orafti. batch: HPBNH4DNH4) and inulin from dahlia tubers (from Sigma, article number 1-3754. batch: 75H7065). and the molecular mass distribution of the inulins was determined by gel permeation chromatography {see method 3.1). This distribution is depicted in Figure 5. and the molecular masses (an hydro fructose = 162 g/mol) and average chain lengths calculated therefrom have been summarized in Table 2.<br>
Analvsis of the molecular weight distribution using the GPC-RI-MALLS system resulted in a weight average molecular mass Mw of 12 088 g/moi and a number average molecular mass Mn of 11 500 g/mol for the artichoke inulin. This corresponds to an average chain length of 75 for DPw and of 71 for DPn. The chain lengths of the purified artichoke inulin are on average distinct!} longer than those of Raftiline HP (DPu=33. DPn=29) and of dahlia inulin iDP\\=39.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
<br>
Raftiline IIP (from Orafti. batches HPBN03DNO3 and HPBNH4DNH4) and inulins from dahlia tubers (from Sigma, article number 1-3754. batch: 022K7045 or 75117065) and Jerusalem artichoke roots (Sigma, article number I-2XX0 batches I 1 1117045 and 88F7220) the degree of branching were determined by means of methylalion analysis (see General Methods. 5.11.<br>
Hydrolysis, reduction and acetylation of 2-1 -linked fructans result in 1.2.5-tri-0-acel\)-3.4.6-tri-O-methyl-D-manniiol and -sorbitol. The terminal fructosyl radicals afford 2.5-di-O-acetyl-1.3.4.6-letra-O-methyI-D-mannitol and -sorbitol. A terminal glucopyranosyl unit results in 1.5-di-0'acetyl-2.3.4.6-tetra'0-methyl-D-sorbitol, Building blocks additionally branched in position 6 give the corresponding ! .2,5.6-letra-0-acelv]-3.4-di-0-melhyla)ditol,s.<br>
Besides the products indicating 2-1 linkage, it was possible to detect in a)) fructan samples those from terminal fructose and glucose building blocks. The chromaloizrams additionally showed difructose dianhydride (DFDA. approx. 3 mol%) which is formed on removal of TFA in a stream of nitrogen from 2-1 linked fructose.<br>
From the mass spectra it was additionally possible to identify products resulting from a 2-1.6 linkage in all the samples. I.3- and [.4-acetyiated compounds were also identified, which would arise with branches in positions 3 and 4. respectively, but may also derive from incomplete methylation. The nonspecific occurrence of 1.3- and 1.4-acetylated products is an indicator of submethylation. Assuming that position 6 is affected by submethylation to the same extent as positions 3 and 4. the nonspecific proportion (average of 1.3-Ac and 1.4-Ac compounds) is subtracted from the proportion of 2-1,6-branched fructose units. Table 4 below shows the results resulting therefrom.<br>

Evaluation of the mcthjlation analysis revealed a degree of branching of 1.1 mol% for the artichoke inulin. The degree of branching of this inulin is thus distinctK higher than that in [he inulins of the reference samples from chicon (RaftilineHPf. dahlia and Jerusalem artichoke.<br>
Example 2 Properties of the inulin from artichoke roots<br>
All the following investigations relate to the artichoke inulin of the invention described previously in Example 1 and detailed previously in Tables 1-4. The comparative Raftiline HP and dahlia inulins are likewise those detailed in Example 1.<br>
1. Differentia) scanning ealorimetry investigation of inulin<br>
The differential scanning calorimetric analysis of inulin (for procedure: sec methods) showed distinct differences between the various materials (see Table 5 below) in relation to the melting behavior. Both inulin samples differed greatly in relation to the enthalpy of fusion. This was above 29 .1/g for artichoke inulin and only 22.8 .1/g for Raftiline HP. The differences in Timscl (To) were somewhat less, but the initial melting temperature for artichoke inulin was 4QA°C which was more than 2.5°C higher than for the comparative chicory inulin. This increased thermal stability of artichoke inulin may be a considerable advantage in certain thermal processes in the food products sector, because the artichoke inulin is distinctly less sensitive to high temperatures than chicory inulin.<br>

4. Spray drying, particle size<br>
An inulin with DIV :" 8] was prepared as described in example 1. After an intermediate freeze drying, it was redissolved and then spray dried on a Glatt GPCG3.1 fluid ized bed spray-drying unit. For this purpose, freeze-dried inulin was introduced into water, heated to 85-9()°C and dissolved. The healed solution was spra\ dried with varying outlet air temperature, and the process properties and product properties were observed. The inlet temperature was kept constant at 120°C. The feed consisted of 80% water and 20% inulin. the feed temperature was 85-90°C and the outlet air temperature was 80°C.<br>
The particle size distribution was determined by sieve analysis as described above. The results of the sieve analysis of the spray-dried sample are indicated in table 8 below. The average particle size of the spray-dried product was determined from the particle size distribution of the sieve analysis to be

5. Crystallinity<br>
Inulin samples in powder form were prepared without further pretreatment in a 2 mm-thick sample carrier (standard) between two PET covering films. The X-ray measurements were carried out with a D5000 two-circle diffractometer from Bruker-AXS in symmetrical transmission using monochromatic (Ge('I11) monochromator) Cu-fCa radiation. The recordings were made at 30 mA and 40 kV in the 29 angle range of 3-29° (step width A28 = 0.1°) and 29.5-104 (step width A20 = 0.5). step/A29: 60 seconds.<br>

The scattering plot for sample 2 (see below) was used as amorphous background file. Fructose was used as chemical basis, calculated with a density of 1.65 g/cnr\ The crystallite sizes D(hui were determined from the half-widths of the X-ra\ reflections by the Scherrer formula at the first two main interferences at 20 = 8° and 12°.<br>
The sample of a freczc-dried imilrn with a DPw of 77-82 and of a drum-dried inulin with DPw 81 was measured. The results obtained are in table 9 below:<br>

6. Structure formation of the inulins after heating in water<br>
15 ml portions of 20% strength suspensions of the inulins in water were each made up in aluminum beakers (RVA-3d beakers from Winopal Forschungsbedarf GmbH: volume about 70 ml. diameter 38 mm). stirred up and equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and finally covered. The suspensions were heated using a multithermal stirrer (VARIOMAG Multitherm 15 from H+P Labortechnik AG) with stirring. The temperature was controlled in this case b\ using a PT 100 probe (accessory for the VARIOMAG Multitherm 15) which stood in a covered reference beaker with distilled water on the heating block. The multithermal stirrer was preheated so thai the temperature of the reference sample remained stable al 90"C. The suspensions to be heated were placed on the multithermal stirrer and stirred at 90°C for 8 min. The samples were then removed from the multithermal stirrer stored at room temperature for 24 hours. The strength of the resulting gels was then measured using a TA-TX2 texture analyzer (Stable Micro Systems). This measurement was carried out using the SMSP/0.5 R076 penetrating plunger (Stable Micro Systems) with a diameter of 12 mm as measurement system. The following parameters were applied for the TA measurement with the 5 kg measuring cell:<br>

•	'['ravel (depth of penetration) 3 mm<br>

The structure-forming behavior of various inulins after thermal treatment in water was investigated, li emerged from this that the inulins from chicory (Rafiilinc HP'R- and Beneo HPX®) do not form gel-like structures under these conditions (table 10). In contrast thereto, the inulins from artichoke with DPw = 77-81 or DPw = 75 form very strong structures. Surprisingly, the sample in which the spray-dried inulin with DPw = 81 was used also formed considerably stronger gels than the comparable samples (DPw = 77-81 or DPw = 75) in which the fructan was freeze dried. This is particularly clear from the fact that the ge! strengths found with only 15% (w'w) concentration of inulin employed were at a similar level to those with the freezc-dried comparative samples at 20%.<br>

7. Prebiotic properties<br>
The prebiotic effect of inulin according to the invention was investigated in an in vivo model study in a three-stage fermentation system (bowel model). The types of bacteria which colonize<br>
 <br>
the fermentation system, and their metabolic activities (formation of short-chain fall&gt; acids), were ascertained.<br>
I. Materials and methods; a) Continuous three-stage culture system:<br>
A continuous three-stage culture system which has previously been described by Pereira el al. (2003) Appl Environ Microbiol 69(8). 4743-4752 and Probert et al. (2004) Appl Environ Microbiol 70. 4505-4511. was used in this study. The bowel model consisted of three culture vessels VJ. V2 and V3 with working volumes of 0.28. 0.30 and 0.30 liters which were arranged in series. Each vessel was provided with a magnetic stirrer, the temperature was kept at 37°C by means of a waterbath. and the pH in the individual vessels was controlled by an Electrolab pll controller. The entire system (including media reservoir) was operated under anaerobic conditions by passing sterile oxygen-free nitrogen through the liquid. The pH in the three vessels was adjusted by adding (he appropriate amount of 0.5 M HCI-NaOH to 5.5 (VI). 6.2 (V2) and 6.8 (V3). Vessel 1 simulated the microbial conditions in the anterior large bowel. It was relative!) rich in nutrients, had a relatively more acidic pH and a shorter residence time than vessel 3 with a more neutral pH and comparatively little substrate. Vessel 3 simulated the posterior part of the large bowel. Vessel 2 modeled the central, transverse part of the large bowel (transverse colon).<br>
Oxygen-free nitrogen was continuously blown into the sterile culture medium, and it was introduced by means of a peristaltic pump into V] which led sequentially to V2 and V3. The culture medium consisted of the following components in distilled water (g/L): potato starch. 5.0: pectin (citrus). 2.0: casein (sodium salt). 3.0: Rafu'line LS (Orafti. Tienen: BE). 1.0: xylan (oat hull). 2.0: arabinogalactan (Fiuka). 2.0: guargam. 1.0; mucin (porcine gastric type III). 4.0; tryptone (Oxoid). 5.0; peptone water (Oxoid). 5.0: yeast extract (Oxoid). 4.5; bile salts No. 3 (Oxoid), 0.4: I .-cysteine HCJ. 0.8: NaHC03 (Fisher Scientific). 1.5; hemin. 0.05; NaCl (Fisher Scienlific). 4.5; KCI (Fisher Scientific). 4.5: CaC12x6H20 (BDH). 0.15: KH2P04 (BDH). 0.5: FeS04x7H20 (BDH). 0.005; MgS04x7H20 (Fisher Scientific). 1.25. in addition. 1.0 ml of Tween 80 (BDH) and 10 microliters of vitamin K were added. A 4 ml concentration of a 0.025% (w/v) solution of resazurin was added to the growth medium as indicator of anaerobic conditions. The medium was autoclaved at 121X for 15 mm and cooled under a nitrogen atmosphere. Unless indicated otherwise, all chemicals were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co.. UK.<br>
 <br>
Collection and preparation of fecal material:<br>
The remaining volume of each vessel was made up with freshly prepared fecal suspension from a 30-year old man who had not taken any antibiotics for three months before the test. The 20% (w.'w) fresh fecal suspension was prepared with previously reduced phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and digested at normal speed lor 2 minutes in a digestion apparatus (stomach). Large food residues were removed through a tiller sack. One hundred ml of the resulting suspension were then employed to inoculate each of the three fermentation vessels. The system was initially operated as batch culture using the culture medium over 48 hours. After 48 h of batch culture fermentation, ihe complex growth medium which simulates the composition of intestinal fluid was introduced into VI and then into V2 and V3 via the peristaltic pump. The residence time (R) was calculated as reciprocal dilution rate for each vessel. The residence time was set at 27.1 hours, and the system was operated for 12 days after the initial 48 h equilibrium period to ensure a steady state. The overall residence time was the total of the individual residence times R of each fermenter.<br>
Sampling:<br>
The first sample (5 ml) {day 0) was taken after fermentation for 24 h. The fermentation continued until a stead} state was reached {after 10-12 days) (SSI). At this stage, samples of the culture liquid were removed from each vessel for subsequent analysis of bacteria and short-chain fatty acids, and used as indicator of SSI. After SSI was reached, the test substrate was put into vessel 1 each day for a further period of 10-12 days. The fermentation was continued until a further steady state (SS2) was reached and once again samples were taken of the culture liquid from each vessel for subsequent analysis.<br>
Counting of bacteria in fecal samples and samples from the bowel model by FISH analysis: Samples from individual vessels of the fermentation system were treated as shown below. Sample preparation: samples (375 pi) were removed from the batch cultures, added to 1125 p! of filtered 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde solution (pH 7.2). mixed and stored at 4°C overnight in order to fix the cells. The fixed cells were centrifuged at 13 000 rpm for 5 minutes and washed twice in filtered phosphate buffer solution and resuspended in 150 u.1 of PBS. Ethanol (150 ul) was added, and the sample was mixed and stored at -20°C until used, but not for more than 3 months.<br>
 <br>
Hybridization:<br>
The fixed cells (16 ul) were added to 264 pi of preheated (oven) tillered hybridization buffer (preheated in X (30 mM Tris-HCl. 1.36 M NaCl. pH 7.2. 0.1% \'\ sodium dodeevlsulfaie. SDS] and mixed. The mixture was added to the suitable Cy3-labeled probe (50 ng/u.1) in a ratio of 9:1 (v/\■). mixed and placed in the hybridization oven at a suitable temperature overnight.<br>
Washing and filtering:<br>
The hybridized sample (suitable aliquots to achieve from 30 to 150 cells per field of view) was added to 5 ml of preheated, filtered hybridization buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl. 0.9 M NaCl. pi 1 7.2) together with 20 ul of DAP1 (4'.6-diamidino-2-phenylindoIe. 500 ng'ul) and left at the suitable hybridization temperature for 30 min. The mixture was put on a black membrane filter with a pore size of 0.2 pm (GTBP 01300. Millipore Corp.). Slowfade-Light Antifadc (Molecular Probes Europe, Leiden. NL) was put on the filter in order to prevent fading of the fluorescence, and the supports were stored in the dark at 4°C for a maximum of 3 days.<br>
A minimum of 15 fields of view per support was examined with a Nikon Microphot LP! fluorescence microscope (1000 x magnification). The DM510 filter (550 nm) was used in order to count the hybridized cells, and the DM400 extraction filter was used for the DAPI-stained cells.<br>
The following formula was used to calculate the concentration of cells C (cells/ml) in each sample:<br>
C = N x 15.56 x 14 873.74 x (1000'q)<br>
N: average number of cells counted per field of view<br>
q: volume of hybridization mixture used<br>
14 873.74: magnification constant<br>
15.56: factor for all dilutions made<br>
Genus-specific I6S rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes labeled with the fluorescent dye Cy 3 which have previousK been designed and validated were used to count important groups of bacteria. The probes used were BifJ64. specific for bifidobacterium (Langedijk (1995). Appl Environ Microbiol 61. 3069-3075). Bac303. specific for bacteroides (Manz el al. (1996) Microbiology 142. 1097-1106).

2. Results<br>
The following inulins were tested in the bowel model described above:<br>
Inulin ol'the invention: DPw = 77-81<br>
Comparison sample: Raftinline HP* (Orafli). DPw =■ 33 Comparison was made between the second steadv state (SS2) and the first steady state (SSI) and the data were analyzed using Student's l lest.<br>
Figure 5 shows the comparison of the bacterial population in vessel 1 (VI) between steady state 1 (SSI) and steady state 2 (SS2) after treatment with inulin of the invention. Figures 6 and 7 show corresponding comparisons for vessel 2 (V2) and 3 (V3).<br>
Figure 8 shows the comparison of the bacterial population in vessel 1 (VI) between steady state I (SSI) and steady state 2 (SS2) after treatment with the comparative sample. Figures 9 and 10 show corresponding comparisons for vessel 2 (V2) and 3 (V3).<br>
A bifidogenic response was observed after addition of the inulin of the invention to the bowel model. The level of increase was significant in all three vessels for bifidobacteria and significant for lactobacillae in \essel 2 (P
Figure 11 shows a comparison of the concentration of short-chain fatly acids (SCFA) in all vessels between steady state 1 (base line) (SSI) and steady state 2 (SS2) after treatment with inulin of the invention. The individual fatty acids are plotted in each case as bile diagram for each vessel and steady state (e.g. V1-SS1)- From left to right: acetic acid, propionic acid, isobutyric acid, butyric acid, isovaleric acid, n-valeric acid, caproic acid.<br>
Figure 12 shows the comparison of the concentration of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) in all vessels between steady state 1 (base line) {SSI) and steady state 2 (SS2) after treatment with the comparative sample.<br>
 <br>
Addition of the inulin of the invention in the bowel model led to a significant increase in the butyrate and propionate concentrations in vessel 3 (V3) (P
The in vivo lest reveals that the inulin of the invention is a strong potential prebiotic because both the number of bifidobacteria and the number of lactobacillae increased in all three vessels. This was accompanied by an increase in the butyrate concentration in all vessels and a significant increase in butyrate and propionate in vessel 3. The increase in butyrate and propionate in vessel 3 is a strong indication that the inulin of the invention exhibits a prebiotic effect in the posterior part of the large bowel. This is advantageous because the majority of bowel cancers arises in the distal region of the large bowel/in the rectum.<br>
8. Production of yogurt<br>
Methods<br>
Yogurt was prepared in 700 g batches. Milk was standardized to different contents of milk solids without fat (MSNF) in the range 11.0-14.0 percent by weight based on the total composition. The amounts of inulin (inulin of the invention and comparative inulin Beneo HP(f« from Orafti) were adjusted to 0.0 lo 4.5% by weight. The yogurt recipes are listed in table 12. The inulin of the invention (very long chain inulin. abbreviated to VLCI hereinafter) corresponded to the inulin from example 1/table 2 and had an average degree of polymerization DPw of 75. the comparative sample Beneo HP® had a DPw of" 34. All percentages relate to percent by weight based on the iotal composition, unless indicated otherwise.<br>
The dry ingredients were mixed together in order to facilitate the dispersion of inulin and fat-free dry milk, and then added to the milk with moderate shearing in order to form the yogurt base. The standardized base was maintained at 4°C for 3 hours so that the fat-free dry' milk could dissolve completely. Each batch was pasteurized at SOT for 30 minutes, rapidly cooled to 44°C and inoculated with Yo-Flex 88 (Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii. from Chr. Hansen }nc.) in a concentration of 3.6 g/1. For pot-fermented yogurt (custard style yogurt).<br>
 <br>
inoculated base was poured into the final packs before incubation. Stirred yoghurt was incubated in large tanks. The base mixes were incubated al 44°C for 4-6 hours until they reached pi I 4.5 (initial pll about 6.8). When the yoghurt reached pH 4.5. the custard-style vogun samples were cooled to 4r'C and maintained thereat for 48 hours in order to reach the maximum viscosity. Stirred samples were cooled to J5°C. mixed with lou shearing, packaged in plastic pots, cooled to 4°C and maintained thereat Ibr 48 hours in order to reach the maximum viscosity. The viscosity was measured with a Brookfield viscometer with a heliopath adapter.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
<br>
Results:<br>
Figure 13 shows the effects of inulin and milk solids on the yogurt viscosity. The inulin of the invention (\ LCI) dc\eloped a significant viscosilv in fat-free \ogurt. the viscosin levels reached with 4.?% VLCI being twice as high as those of a yogurt with 1.5% fat witliout an\ inulin. The right-hand curve in figure 13 shows the dramatic change in viscosity when the VLCI contents in the yogurt with about 13.5% milk solids rise from 1.5% (o 4-5%. By comparison (herewith, a change in the content of Beneo HP&amp; had an only insignificant influence on the viscosity, even when the content of milk solids changed by 1%. The curve top left in figure 13 demonstrates the effect of increasing milk solids in yogurt which contains 3.5% VLCI. In general, an increase of 1% in VLCI increased the viscosity of the fat-free yogurt by approximately 30%. whereas Beneo HP© had a very much smaller effect on the viscosity. Depending on the content of milk solids, the amount of VLCI necessary to generate the viscosity level of a comparative yogurt with 1.5% fat was 1.5-3.5%. At least 3.5% of Beneo HP'S; were necessary to achieve the viscositv level of a comparative yogurt with 1.5% fat.<br>
In a further lest. 2.5% VLCI and 4.5% Beneo HPfc were mixed in a fat-free yogurt. A reduced fat yogurt with 1.5% fat was used as comparison. The sample with VLCI had a higher viscositv than the iwo comparalixe samples with Beneo HP'6 and 1.5% fat. as shown in the (able below.<br>
Table 13<br>
<br>
Amount of inulin	i<br>
■ Viscositv'relative<br>
2.5% VLCI	4666<br>
4.5% Beneo HP&amp;	!                 3400<br>
1.5% fat	i	3300<br>
VLC) is unambiguously more effective at changing the texlure of fat-free yogurt than Beneo HP'©, since higher viscosities were achieved with lower contents. This opens up the possibility of employing inulin more economically in yogurt while maintaining an inulin content necessary to achieve a good bulking effect. In the above experiments, minimum amounts of 3 g of inulin per portion were maintained as the amount necessary for a bulking effect.<br>
Table 14 shows further tests with pot-fermented yogurt (custard style). Production took place as indicated previously. It is evident that a spray-dried inulin of the invention has a particularly strong viscosity-increasing effect compared with the freeze-dried and drum-dried inuiins. 2.5% spray-dried or drum-dried inulin of the invention still bring about a greater increase in viscosity<br>
 <br>
than 4.5"<i inulin from the comparative example.></i>
Table 15 shows tests with unstirred, pot-fermented yogurt (custard) and with stirred votiurl. Samples \-D were fermented normal 1\. One portion of each sample was mixed with gentle shearing while the yogurt was still warm (37-40°C). The stirred and unstirred (custard) preparations were analyzed for the viscosity of each sample after 48 hours. Samples E-l were again fermented normally, but the stirred fractions E-G were mixed warm, as above, and sucrose was added during the mixing process. Samples H and 1 were mixed after the temperature had fallen to 10°C. in order to investigate the temperature effect on the inulin \iscosil\ and yogurt viseosih.<br>
Addition of the spray-dried inulin of the invention (test C) increased the viscosity in the stirred and custard preparations, with the viscosity of whole-fat yogurt (test 1)) being reached. In the second series (tests E-l). the viscosity was about the same on addition of the comparative inulin Beneo HP'R: as after addition of the inulin of the invention, but the product from test F was granular and the smoothness was low. A further observation was that in all experiments there was formation of a 5 mm layer of denatured whey protein on the bottom of the fermentation vessel - with the exception of the examples in which inulin of the invention was added. This is an indication that the inulin of the invention has beneficial effects on yogurt stability.<br>
