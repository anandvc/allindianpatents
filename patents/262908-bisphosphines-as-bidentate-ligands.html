				<td>Bisphosphines as bidentate ligands<br>
The present invention relates to bisphosphines as<br>
bidentate ligands, a process for the production thereof<br>
and their use. In particular, the invention concerns<br>
bisphosphines of the general structure (I) .<br><br>
Enantiomer-enriched chiral ligands are used in asymmetric<br>
synthesis or asymmetric catalysis. It is essential here<br>
for the electronic and stereochemical properties of the<br>
ligand to be optimally adapted to the particular catalysis<br>
problem. An important aspect of the success of these<br>
families of compounds is attributed to the creation of a<br>
particularly asymmetric environment of the metal centre by<br>
these ligand systems. To utilise such an environment for<br>
an effective transfer of chirality, it is advantageous to<br>
control the flexibility of the ligand system as an<br>
inherent limitation of the asymmetric induction.<br>
Within the family of phosphorus-containing ligands, cyclic<br>
phosphines, particularly the phospholanes, have achieved<br>
particular significance. Bidentate, chiral phospholanes<br>
are, for example, the DuPhos and BPE ligands used in<br>
asymmetric catalysis. Ideally, therefore, a chiral ligand<br>
basic skeleton capable of versatile modification is<br>
available, which can be varied within broad limits in<br>
respect of its steric and electronic properties.<br>
The object of this invention is therefore to provide a<br>
ligand skeleton analogous to that of the existing<br>
phospholane ligands, but which can additionally be varied<br>
and used within broad limits and possesses comparably good<br>
catalytic properties. In particular, the invention is<br>
based on the object of providing novel, asymmetric,<br>
bidentate and chiral phosphine ligand systems for<br>
catalytic purposes, which can be produced simply and with<br>
high enantiomeric purity.<br>
These and other problems not otherwise specified but<br>
arising from the prior art are solved by a family of<br>
chiral bidentate bisphosphine compounds of the general<br>
formula (I) , the compounds according to the invention<br>
having two chiral phosphine radicals bonded together via<br>
an unsaturated bridge.<br>
By preparing enantiomer-enriched bidentate<br>
organophosphorus ligands of the general formula (I),<br><br>
wherein<br>
R1, R2, R3, R4, independently of one another, denote<br>
(C1-C8)-alkyl, (C2-C8)-alkoxyalkyl, (C6-C18)-aryl, (C7-C19)-<br>
aralkyl, (C3-C18) -heteroaryl, (C4-C19) -heteroaralkyl,<br>
(C1-C8)-alkyl-(C6-C18)-aryl, (C1-C8)-alkyl-(C3-C18) -<br>
heteroaryl, (C3-C8)-cycloalkyl, (C1-C8) -alkyl- (C3-C8) -<br>
cycloalkyl, (C3-C8) -cycloalkyl- (C1-C8) -alkyl,<br>
or R1 and R2 and/or R3 and R4 represent a (C3-C5)-alkylene<br>
bridge mono-or polysubstituted with (C1-C8)-alkyl, HO-<br>
(C1-C8) -alkyl, (C1-C8) -alkoxy, (C2-C8)-alkoxyalkyl,<br>
(C6-C18)-aryl, (C7-C19)-aralkyl, (C1-C8)-alkyl-(C6-Ci8)-aryl,<br>
(C3-C8) -cycloalkyl, (C1-C8) -alkyl- (C3-C8) -cycloalkyl,<br>
(C3-C8)-cycloalkyl-(C1-C8)-alkyl, this optionally being<br>
linked to a polymer enlargement,<br>
and A denotes one of the following structures<br><br>
wherein<br>
R denotes H, (C1-C8)-alkyl, (C6-C18)-aryl, (C7-C19) -aralkyl,<br>
(C1-C8)-alkyl-(C6-C18)-aryl, (C3-C8) -cycloalkyl,<br>
(C1-C8) -alkyl- (C3-C8) -cycloalkyl,<br>
(C3-C8)-cycloalkyl-(C1-C8)-alkyl, or the link to a polymer<br>
enlargement,<br>
Q = 0, NH, NR, previously unknown compounds are obtained,<br>
which can be successfully used in asymmetric catalysis for<br>
the production of organic compounds. Thus, with the<br>
ligands provided by the invention, complexes or catalysts<br>
can be produced for the successful hydrogenation of<br>
mixtures of acylated E- and Z-ß-aminoacrylic acids or<br>
derivatives thereof, among other things. To date, only a<br>
few complexes have been successfully tested for mixtures<br>
of this family of compounds, and so up to now it has been<br>
necessary to perform an often complicated purification of<br>
the E/Z mixtures before hydrogenation, so as to be able to<br>
react the acylated E-ß-aminoacrylic acids and derivates,<br>
which can only be hydrogenated with high enantiomeric<br>
excesses, separately from Z-components.<br>
The ligands according to the invention preferably<br>
correspond to structures of the general formula (II),<br><br>
wherein<br>
A takes on the meaning given above,<br>
R5 to R12, independently of one another, denote<br>
(C1-C8)-alkyl, HO-(C1-C8)-alkyl, (C1-C8)-alkoxy,<br>
(C2-C8)-alkoxyalkyl, (C6-C18)-aryl, (C7-C19) -aralkyl,<br>
(C1-C8) -alkyl- (C6-CC19)8) -aryl, (C3-C8) -cycloalkyl,<br>
(C1-C8) -alkyl- (C3-C8) -cycloalkyl,<br>
(C3-C8) -cycloalkyl- (C1-C8) -alkyl,<br>
or the link to a polymer enlargement.<br>
The ligand systems according to the invention can<br>
therefore be attached to a polymer enlargement. The<br>
ligands or the complexes/catalysts that can be produced<br>
from them can thus be separated very readily from the low<br>
molecular-weight compounds, e.g. by filtration, owing to<br>
the link to the polymer enlargement, and are thus<br>
accessible to the recycling desired by the invention,<br>
which is extremely simple but nonetheless advantageous.<br>
The ligands/complexes can be enlarged in molecular weight<br>
by linking to a polymer enlargement, and optionally<br>
heterogenised in this way. The enantioselective<br>
hydrogenation with complexes or catalysts that have been<br>
thus enlarged in molecular weight can therefore proceed in<br>
both a homogeneous and a heterogeneous phase.<br>
Polymer enlargement:<br>
The polymer enlargement can be freely selected within the<br>
framework of the invention. It is limited on the one hand<br>
by considerations of practicability and costs, and on the<br>
other hand by prevailing technical conditions (retention<br>
capacity, solubility etc.). Some polymer enlargements for<br>
catalysts are known from the prior art (Reetz et al.,<br>

particularly DE 19910691.6; Janda et al., J. Am. Chem.<br>
Soc. 1998, 120, 9481f.; Andersson et al., Chem. Commun.<br>

"Functional Polymers" Ed. : R. Arshady, ASC, Washington,<br>
1996; "Praktikum der Makromolekularen Stoffe", D. Braun et<br>
al., VCH-Wiley, Weinheim 1999).<br>
It is also preferred for the polymer enlargement to be<br>
formed by polyacrylates, polyacrylamides,<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidinones, polysiloxanes, polybutadienes,<br>
polyisoprenes, polyalkanes, polystyrenes, polyoxazolines<br>
or polyethers, or mixtures thereof. In an especially<br>
preferred embodiment, polystyrenes are used to construct<br>
the polymer enlargement.<br>
Linkers:<br>
Between the actual ligand and the polymer enlargement, a<br>
linker can be incorporated. The linker serves to create a<br>
distance between ligand and polymer to reduce or eliminate<br>
mutual interactions that are disadvantageous to the<br>
reaction.<br>
The linkers can, in principle, be freely selected by the<br>
person skilled in the art. They should be selected<br>
according to the aspects of how well they can be coupled<br>
to the polymer/monomer on the one hand and to the ligand<br>
on the other hand. Suitable linkers can be found e.g. in<br>
the literature references mentioned above under the<br>
heading of "Polymer enlargement".<br>
Within the framework of the invention, these active units<br>
of formulae (I) to (IV) are therefore advantageously bound<br>
to the polymer enlargement directly, or preferably via a<br>
linker selected from the group<br>
a) -Si(R2)-<br>
b) -(SiR2-O)n- n=l-10000<br>
c) -(CHR-CHR-O)n- n=l-10000<br>
d) -(X)n- n=l-20<br>
e) Z-(X)n- n=0-20<br>
f) -(X)n-W n=0-20<br>
g) Z-(X)n-W n=0-20<br>
wherein<br>
R denotes H, (C1-C8) -alkyl, (C6-C18) -aryl, (C7-C19)-aralkyl,<br>
( (C1-C8)-alkyl) 1-3-(C6-C18)-aryl,<br>
X denotes (C6-Ci8)-arylene, (C1-C8) -alkylene, (C1-C8)-<br>
alkenylene, ((C1-C8) -alkyl) 1-3- (C6-C18) -arylene, (C7-C19) -<br>
aralkylene,<br>
Z, W denote, independently of one another, -C(=O)0-,<br>
-C(=O)NH-, -C(=O)-, NR, 0, CHR, CH2, C=S, S, PR.<br>
Other preferred compounds that can be used as linkers are<br>
shown in the following diagram:<br>
However, linkers such as e.g. 1,4'-biphenyl, 1, 2-ethylene,<br>
1,3-propylene, PEG-(2-10), a,?-siloxanylene or<br>
1,4-phenylene as well as a,?-1, 4-bisethylenebenzene or<br>
linkers obtainable from siloxanes of the general<br>
formula IV are especially preferred.<br><br>
These can easily be bound to any double bonds present in<br>
the polymers and suitable functional groups of the active<br>
centres under hydrosilylation conditions (overview of the<br>
hydrosilylation reaction by Ojima in The Chemistry of<br>
Organic Silicon Compounds, 1989 John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.,<br>
1480 - 1526).<br>
The size of the polymer enlargement should preferably be<br>
calculated such that the actual catalyst (formed from<br>
optionally polymer-enlarged ligand and transition metal)<br>
dissolves in the solvent to be used, so work can be<br>
performed in a homogeneous phase. The polymer-enlarged<br>
complex/catalyst used is preferably therefore a<br>
homogeneously soluble one. As a result, negative effects,<br>
which occur as a result of the phase change of the<br>
substrates and products otherwise necessary with the use<br>
of heterogeneous catalysts, can be avoided. The polymer-<br>
enlarged ligands can have an average molecular weight in<br>
the range of 1,000 - 1,000,000, preferably 5,000 -<br>
500,000, particularly preferably 5,000 - 300,000, g/mol.<br>
It lies within the framework of the invention that the<br>
above-mentioned components of the polymer-enlarged<br>
catalysts (I) to (IV) (polymer, linker, ligand) can be<br>
combined at will in accordance with the knowledge of a<br>
person skilled in the art to achieve an optimum reaction.<br>
Combination of polymer enlargement with linker/ligand:<br>
In principle there are two ways in which linkers/ligands<br>
can be attached to the polymer enlargement:<br>
a) the active unit causing the chiral induction (ligand)<br>
is bound with an attached linker or directly to a<br>
monomer and this is copolymerised with other<br>
unmodified monomers, or<br>
b) the active unit causing the chiral induction (ligand)<br>
is bound with a linker or directly to the finished<br>
polymer.<br>
Polymers according to a) or b) can optionally be prepared<br>
and block-copolymerised with other polymers, which also<br>
exhibit the active units causing the chiral induction<br>
(ligand) or which do not exhibit them.<br>
In principle, it is also true for the number of<br>
linkers/ligands per monomer in the polymer that as many as<br>
possible of these catalytically active units (ligands)<br>
should be accommodated in a polymer, so that the<br>
conversion per polymer enlargement is increased as a<br>
result. On the other hand, however, the ligands should be<br>
sufficiently spaced apart so that a reciprocal negative<br>
effect on the reactivity (TOF, selectivity) is minimised<br>
or completely avoided. Preferably, therefore, the distance<br>
between the linkers/ligands in the polymer should be in<br>
the range of 1-200 monomer units, preferably 5-25 monomer<br>
units.<br>
In an advantageous embodiment, those positions in the<br>
polymer or monomer to be polymerised that can readily be<br>
functionalised, or allow an existing functionality to be<br>
used for the link, are used for attaching the<br>
linker/ligand. Thus, heteroatoms or unsaturated carbon<br>
atoms are preferably suitable for constructing the link.<br>
In the case of styrene/polystyrene as polymer enlargement,<br>
for example, the existing aromatics can be used as<br>
connecting points to the linkers/ligands. Functionalities<br>
can be readily attached to these aromatics, preferably in<br>
3-, 4- or 5- position, particularly preferably in 4-<br>
position, by means of standard aromatic chemistry.<br>
However, it is also advantageous to mix e.g. already<br>
functionalised monomer into the mixture to be polymerised<br>
and to bond the linker/ligand to the functionalities<br>
present in the polystyrene after the polymerisation.<br>
Advantageously suitable for this purpose are e.g. para-<br>
hydroxy-, para-chloromethyl- or para-aminostyrene<br>
derivatives.<br>
In the case of polyacrylates, an acid group or ester group<br>
is present in the monomer component in each case, to which<br>
the linker or the active unit can be linked before or<br>
after the polymerisation, preferably via an ester or amide<br>
bond.<br>
Polysiloxanes as polymer enlargement are preferably<br>
constructed in such a way that, in addition to<br>
dimethylsilane units, hydromethylsilane units are also<br>
present. The linkers/ligands can then also be attached to<br>
these positions by a hydrosilylation. These can<br>
preferably be linked to the functionalities under<br>
consideration in the polymer under hydrosilylation<br>
conditions (overview of the hydrosilylation reaction by<br>
Ojima in The Chemistry of Organic Silicon Compounds, 1989<br>
John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd., 1480 - 1526).<br>
Suitable polysiloxanes modified in this way are known in<br>
the literature ("Siloxane polymers and copolymers" White<br>
et al., in Ed. S. Patai "The Chemistry of Organic Silicon<br>
Compounds" Wiley, Chichester, 1989, 46, 2954; C. Wandrey<br>
et al. TH: Asymmetry 1997, 8, 1975).<br>
Combination of linker with active unit:<br>
That which applies to the joining of polymer to<br>
linker/ligand, is synonymously applicable to the attaching<br>
of the ligand (active unit) to the linker.<br>
Thus, the linker attachment to the active units can<br>
preferably take place via heteroatoms or certain<br>
functionalities such as C=0, CH2, 0, N, S, P, Si or B,<br>
ether-/thioether bonds, amine bonds or amide bonds<br>
preferably being linked, or esterifications, alkylations,<br>
silylations and additions to double bonds being carried<br>
out.<br>
Those linking methods already described in the prior art<br>
for the polymer enlargement of the monomeric active units<br>
are particularly preferred (W098/35927; Chem. Commun.<br>
1999, 1917; Angew. Chem. 1997, 16, 183 5; J. Am. Chem. Soc.<br>

1990, 31, 3003; Chem. Commun. 1998, 2435; Tetrahedron<br>
Lett. 1997, 38, 2577).<br>
The production of a polymer-enlarged ligand system or<br>
catalyst for the purpose of the invention can also be<br>
carried out, in principle, according to the specification<br>
in DE10029600.<br>
Ligands of the general formula (III) or (IV)<br>
wherein<br>
A and Q have the meaning in claim 1, R' = H or R, and<br>
R, independently of one another in each case, denotes<br>
(C1-C8)-alkyl, HO-(C1-C8)-alkyl, (C2-C8) -alkoxyalkyl,<br>
(C6-C18)-aryl, (C7-C19) -aralkyl, (C1-C8)-alkyl-(C6-C18)-aryl,<br>
(C3-C8)-cycloalkyl, (C1-C8)-alkyl-(C3-C8)-cycloalkyl or<br>
(C3-C8)-cycloalkyl-(C1-C8)-alkyl, are also preferred.<br>
Ligands of the structures (III) and (IV) shown above, in<br>
which R is methyl, ethyl, propyl, iso-propyl, tert.-butyl<br>
or phenyl, are extremely preferred. Structures in which Q<br>
is oxygen or NR', wherein R' is (C1-C8) -alkyl, (C6-C18)-aryl<br>
or benzyl, and those in which Q is oxygen or NRX, wherein<br>
R' is methyl, ethyl, propyl, iso-propyl, tert.-butyl,<br>
phenyl, naphthyl, fluorenyl or benzyl, are also extremely<br>
preferred.<br>
The ligands according to the invention shown should, if<br>
possible, possess a high enantiomeric purity. The<br>
compounds of formulae (I) to (IV) should preferably<br>
possess an enantiomeric enrichment of &gt;90 %, more<br>
preferably &gt; 98%.<br>
Another aspect of the invention provided relates to<br>
complexes containing the ligands according to the<br>
invention with at least one transition metal. Palladium,<br>
platinum, rhodium, ruthenium, osmium, iridium, cobalt,<br>
nickel or copper, in any catalytically relevant oxidation<br>
stage, are suitable as transition metals. These complex<br>
compounds are obtainable in solution by simply adding the<br>
ligands according to the invention to metal complex<br>
precursors, with which the person skilled in the art is<br>
familiar.<br>
In another form, the invention also relates to a process<br>
for the production of the ligands according to the<br>
invention, wherein the corresponding phosphines are<br>
obtained by reacting LiP(SiMe3)2 with corresponding co-<br>
reactants provided with nucleofuge leaving groups in the<br>
presence of an organometallic base. Alkyl metals, such as<br>
e.g. n-, sec-, tert.-BuLi, MeLi, or the like, can be used<br>
as the organometallic base.<br>
The trimethylsilylphosphines thus obtained are preferably<br>
reacted with the corresponding dihalogen derivative of the<br>
structures of group A illustrated above, the halogen atoms<br>
each being positioned on the free valencies of the<br>
structures shown.<br>
One method of producing a group of the ligands according<br>
to the invention will be described below by way of an<br>
example. For the sake of clarity, maleic anhydride<br>
derivatives were selected in the illustrations, without<br>
thereby implying any restrictions or limitations for A.<br>
In general, the procedure is to react an enantiomer-<br>
enriched sulfate with a phosphine in the presence of a<br>
strong base to form the monophospholane. In another<br>
reaction step, the phosphorus-carbon bond is split with<br>
the aid of an alkali metal and converted to silyl<br>
phospholane by adding a halogen silyl compound. In the<br>
following step, the silyl phospholane is reacted with 2,3-<br>
dichloromaleic anhydride or a 2,3-dichloromaleamide<br>
derivative to form the bisphospholane.<br>
The diol is converted to the dimesylate in the presence of<br>
a nitrogen base and then converted to the phospholane in<br>
the presence of Li2PPh2-THF (Tetrahedron Asymmetry 1991, 2,<br>
569-592).<br><br>
The phospholane is also obtained by reacting the cyclic<br>
sulfate with H2PPh in the presence of an alkali metal<br>
hydride (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999, 121, 9899-9900).<br><br>
Another alternative preparation of the phospholane is<br>
achieved by reacting the cyclic sulfate with<br>
phenylphosphine in the presence of butyllithium.<br><br>
After splitting the Ph-P bond with elementary lithium, the<br>
P-silylated compound is obtained by adding trimethylsilyl<br>
chloride.<br><br>
An alternative synthesis route involves the reaction of<br>
the cyclic sulfate with lithium bis(trimethylsilyl)-<br>
phosphine {Organometallics 2000, 19, 250). Instead of the<br>
methanolysis of the phosphorus-silicon bonds described by<br>
Burk et al., it has proved advantageous in the synthesis<br>
of the ligands according to the invention to perform ring<br>
closure by adding methyllithium to form the<br>
trimethylsilyl-substituted phospholane.<br><br>
In both reaction routes, the formation of the<br>
trimethylsilyl-substituted phospholane in meso-form is<br>
observed as a side reaction.<br>
In the following step, the reaction of silyl phospholane<br>
with a 2,3-dichloromaleic acid derivative takes place<br>
analogously to a coupling reaction of Fenske et al. and<br>
Kinting et al. {Chem. Ber. 1974, 107, 117; J. Organomet.<br>
Chem. 1986, 302, 259) .<br><br>
The purification of the ligand takes place by the<br>
formation of the metal complex. Here, surprisingly, it has<br>
been found that a complex is obtained in optically pure<br>
form from the diastereomeric mixture of the ligand-metal<br>
compounds.<br>
The compounds of the general formulae (I) - (IV) can be<br>
used as ligands for complex compounds in asymmetric,<br>
metal-catalysed reactions (such as e.g. hydrogenation,<br>
hydroformylation, rearrangement, allylic alkylation,<br>
cyclopropanation, hydrosilylation, hydride transfers,<br>
hydroborations, hydrocyanations, hydrocarboxylations,<br>
aldol reactions or Heck reaction). They are particularly<br>
suitable for asymmetric reactions.<br>
Suitable complexes, particularly of the general<br>
formula (V) , contain ligands according to the invention of<br>
formulae (I) - (IV) as ligands,<br><br>
wherein, in general formula (V), M denotes a metal centre,<br>
preferably a transition metal centre, L denotes the same<br>
or different, coordinating, organic or inorganic ligands<br>
and P denotes bidentate organophosphorus ligands of<br>
formulae (I) - (IV) according to the invention, S<br>
represents coordinating solvent molecules and A represents<br>
equivalents of non-coordinating anions, wherein x and y<br>
are whole numbers greater than or equal to 1, and z, q<br>
and r are whole numbers greater than or equal to 0.<br>
The sum of y + z + q has an upper limit set by the<br>
coordination centres available at the metal centres, it<br>
being unnecessary for all the coordination positions to be<br>
occupied. Complex compounds with an octahedral, pseudo-<br>
octahedral, tetrahedral, pseudo-tetrahedral or square-<br>
planar coordination sphere, which can also be distorted<br>
around the transition metal centre in each case, are<br>
preferred. The sum of y + z + q is less than or equal to 6<br>
in these complex compounds'.<br>
The complex compounds according to the invention contain<br>
at least one metal atom or ion, preferably a transition<br>
metal atom or ion, particularly of palladium, platinum,<br>
rhodium, ruthenium, osmium, iridium, cobalt, nickel or<br>
copper in any catalytically relevant oxidation stage.<br>
Complex compounds with fewer than four metal centres are<br>
preferred, and those with one or two metal centres are<br>
particularly preferred. The metal centres can be occupied<br>
by various metal atoms and/or ions.<br>
Preferred ligands L of these complex compounds are halide,<br>
particularly Cl, Br and I, diene, particularly<br>
cyclooctadiene, norbornadiene, olefin, particularly<br>
ethylene and cyclooctene, acetato, trifluoroacetato,<br>
acetylacetonato, allyl, methallyl, alkyl, particularly<br>
methyl and ethyl, nitrile, particularly acetonitrile and<br>
benzonitrile, and also carbonyl and hydrido ligands.<br>
Preferred coordinating solvents S are amines, particularly<br>
triethylamine, alcohols, particularly methanol and<br>
aromatics, particularly benzene and cumene.<br>
Preferred non-coordinating anions A are trifluoroacetate,<br>
trifluoromethane sulfonate, BF4, ClO4, PF6, SbF6 and BAr4.<br>
Different molecules, atoms or ions of the individual<br>
components M, P, L, S and A can be contained in the<br>
individual complex compounds.<br>
Among the ionically constructed complex compounds,<br>
compounds of the [RhP(diene) ] +A- type are preferred,<br>
wherein P represents a ligand of formulae (I) - (IV)<br>
according to the invention.<br>
The preparation of these metal-ligand complex compounds<br>
can take place in situ by the reaction of a metal salt or<br>
a corresponding pre-complex with the ligands of the<br>
general formulae (I) - (IV). In addition, a metal-ligand<br>
complex compound can be obtained by reaction of a metal<br>
salt or a corresponding pre-complex with the ligands of<br>
the general formulae (I) - (IV) and subsequent isolation.<br>
Examples of the metal salts are metal chlorides, bromides,<br>
iodides, cyanides, nitrates, acetates, acetylacetonates,<br>
hexafluoroacetylacetonates, tetrafluoroborates,<br>

The complex compounds based on one or more metals of the<br>
metallic elements, particularly from the group of Ru, Co,<br>
Rh, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt and Cu, can already be catalysts or can<br>
be used to produce catalysts based on one or more metals<br>
of the metallic elements, particularly from the group of<br>
Ru, Co, Rh, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt and Cu. All these complex<br>
compounds are particularly suitable in the asymmetric<br>
hydrogenation of C=C-, C=0- or C=N-bonds, in which they<br>
exhibit high activities and selectivities, and in<br>
asymmetric hydroformylation. In particular, it proves<br>
advantageous here that the ligands of the general formulae<br>
(I) - (IV) can be very well adapted, sterically and<br>
electronically, to the particular substrate and the<br>
catalytic reaction owing to their simple, broad<br>
adaptability.<br>
Corresponding catalysts contain at least one of the<br>
complex compounds according to the invention.<br>
As already indicated, the use of the complexes or<br>
catalysts according to the invention is particularly<br>
suitable for the hydrogenation of E/Z mixtures of<br>
prochiral N-acylated P-aminoacrylic acids or their<br>
derivatives. Acetyl, formyl or urethane or carbamoyl<br>
protective groups can preferably be used here as the acyl<br>
group.<br>
In principle, the ligands and complexes/catalysts are used<br>
in a way known to the person skilled in the art in the<br>
form of transfer hydrogenation ("Asymmetric transfer<br>
hydrogenation of C=0 and C=N bonds", M. Wills et al.<br>
Tetrahedron: Asymmetry 1999, 10, 2045; "Asymmetric<br>
transfer hydrogenation catalyzed by chiral ruthenium<br>
complexes" R. Noyori et al. Ace. Chem. Res. 1997, 30, 97;<br>
"Asymmetric catalysis in organic synthesis", R. Noyori,<br>
John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1994, p.123; "Transition<br>
metals for organic Synthesis" Ed. M. Beller, C. Bolm,<br>
Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 1998, vol. 2, p.97; "Comprehensive<br>
Asymmetric Catalysis" Ed.: Jacobsen, E.N.; Pfaltz, A. ;<br>
Yamamoto, H., Springer-Verlag, 1999), but it can also<br>
proceed conventionally with elemental hydrogen. The<br>
process can thus operate either by hydrogenation with<br>
hydrogen gas or by transfer hydrogenation.<br>
In enantioselective hydrogenation, the preferred procedure<br>
is to dissolve the substrate to be hydrogenated and the<br>
complex/catalyst in a solvent. The catalyst is preferably<br>
formed from a pre-catalyst as indicated above, in the<br>
presence of the chiral ligand, by reaction or by pre-<br>
hydrogenation before the substrate is added. Hydrogenation<br>
is then performed at 0.1 to 10 bar, preferably 0.5 to<br>
5 bar, hydrogen pressure.<br>
The temperature during hydrogenation should be selected<br>
such that the reaction proceeds sufficiently rapidly with<br>
the desired enantiomeric excesses, but side reactions are<br>
avoided as far as possible. It is advantageous to work at<br>
temperatures of -20°C to 100°C, preferably 0°C to 50°C.<br>
The ratio of substrate to catalyst is determined by<br>
economic factors. The reaction should be carried out<br>
sufficiently rapidly with the lowest possible<br>
complex/catalyst concentration. However, it is preferable<br>
to work with a substrate/catalyst ratio of between 10000:1<br>
and 10:1, preferably 1000:1 and 50:1.<br>
The use of the polymer-enlarged ligands or complexes is<br>
advantageous in catalytic processes carried out in a<br>
membrane reactor. The continuous operation that is<br>
possible in this apparatus, in addition to batch and semi-<br>
continuous operation, can be carried out in the cross-flow<br>
filtration mode (Fig. 2) or as dead-end filtration<br>
(Fig. 1), as desired.<br>
Both process variants are described in principle in the<br>
prior art (Engineering Processes for Bioseparations, Ed.:<br>
L.R. Weatherley, Heinemann, 1994, 135-165; Wandrey et al.,<br>
Tetrahedron Asymmetry 1999, 10, 923-928).<br>
For a complex/catalyst to appear suitable for use in a<br>
membrane reactor, it has to fulfil many different<br>
criteria. On the one hand, for example, it should be<br>
ensured that there must be a sufficiently high retention<br>
capacity for the polymer-enlarged complex/catalyst so that<br>
there is satisfactory activity in the reactor over a<br>
desired period, without complex/catalyst having to be<br>
continually added, which is disadvantageous from the point<br>
of view of process economy (DE19910691). In addition, the<br>
catalyst used must have an appropriate tof (turn over<br>
frequency), to be able to convert the substrate into the<br>
product within economically reasonable periods.<br>
In general the p-amino acid precursors were prepared in<br>
accordance with specifications from the literature. For<br>
the syntheses of the compounds, guidance can be taken from<br>
the general specifications by Zhang et al. (G. Zhu, Z.<br>
Chen, X. Zhang J. Org. Chem. 1999, 64, 6907-6910) and<br>
Noyori et al. (W. D. Lubell, M. Kitamura, R. Noyori<br>
Tetrahedron: Asymmetry 1991, 2, 543-554) and also Melillo<br>
et al. (D. G. Melillo, R. D. Larsen, D. J. Mathre, W. F.<br>
Shukis, A. W. Wood, J. R. Colleluori J. Org. Chem. 1987<br>
52, 5143-5150) . Starting from the corresponding 3-<br>
ketocarboxylates, the desired prochiral enamides were<br>
obtained by reaction with ammonium acetate and subsequent<br>
acylation. The hydrogenation products can be converted to<br>
the P-amino acids by measures known to the person skilled<br>
in the art (analogous to the a-amino acids).<br>
Within the framework of the invention, mixtures of<br>
polymer-enlarged polymers refer to the fact that<br>
individual polymers of different origins are polymerised<br>
together into block polymers. Random mixtures of the<br>
monomers in the polymer are also possible.<br>
Polymer enlargement within the framework of the invention<br>
refers to the fact that one or more active units causing<br>
chiral induction (ligands) are copolymerised in a suitable<br>
form with other monomers or that these ligands are<br>
attached to an existing polymer by methods known to the<br>
person skilled in the art. Forms of the units suitable for<br>
copolymerisation are well known to the person skilled in<br>
the art and can be freely selected by him. The procedure<br>
is preferably such that the molecule in question is<br>
derivatised with groups capable of copolymerisation,<br>
according to the type of copolymerisation, e.g. in the<br>
case of copolymerisation with (meth)acrylates, by<br>
attaching to acrylate molecules.<br>
Methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl,<br>
sec-butyl, tert-butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl or octyl,<br>
together with all their bond isomers, can be considered as<br>
(C1-C8)-alkyl radicals.<br>
The (C1-C8) -alkoxy radical corresponds to the (C1-C8)-alkyl<br>
radical, with the proviso that this is bonded to the<br>
molecule via an oxygen atom.<br>
As (C2-C8) -alkoxyalkyl, radicals in which the alkyl chain<br>
is interrupted by at least one oxygen function are meant,<br>
wherein two oxygen atoms cannot be joined to one another.<br>
The number of carbon atoms gives the total number of<br>
carbon atoms contained in the radical.<br>
A (C3-C5)-alkylene bridge is a carbon chain with three to<br>
five C atoms, this chain being bonded to the molecule in<br>
question via two different C atoms.<br>
The radicals just described can be mono- or<br>
polysubstituted with halogens and/or radicals containing<br>
N, 0, P, S or Si atoms. These are particularly alkyl<br>
radicals of the type mentioned above having one or more of<br>
these heteroatoms in their chain or being bonded to the<br>
molecule via one of these heteroatoms.<br>
(C3-C8)-Cycloalkyl means cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl,<br>
cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl or cycloheptyl radicals etc. These<br>
can be substituted with one or more halogens and/or<br>
radicals containing N, 0, P, S or Si atoms and/or can have<br>
N, 0, P or S atoms in the ring, such as e.g. 1-, 2-, 3-,<br>
4-piperidyl, 1-, 2-, 3-pyrrolidinyl, 2-, 3-<br>
tetrahydrofuryl, 2-, 3-, 4-morpholinyl.<br>
A (C3-C8)-cycloalkyl-(C1-C8)-alkyl radical refers to a<br>
cycloalkyl radical as set out above, which is bonded to<br>
the molecule via an alkyl radical as stated above.<br>
(C1-C8) -Acyloxy within the framework of the invention means<br>
an alkyl radical as defined above with a maximum of 8 C<br>
atoms, which is bonded to the molecule via a C00-<br>
function.<br>
(C1-C8)-Acyl within the framework of the invention means an<br>
alkyl radical as defined above with a maximum of 8 C<br>
atoms, which is bonded to the molecule via a CO- function.<br>
A (C6-C18)-aryl radical is understood to mean an aromatic<br>
radical with 6 to 18 C atoms. These include in particular<br>
compounds such as phenyl, naphthyl, anthryl, phenanthryl<br>
or biphenyl radicals, or systems of the type described<br>
above annelated to the molecule in question, such as e.g.<br>
indenyl systems, which can optionally be substituted with<br>
(C1-C8)-alkyl, (C1-C8)-alkoxy, NR1R2, (C1-C8)-acyl or<br>
(C1-C8) -acyloxy.<br>
A (C7-C19) -aralkyl radical is a (C6-C18) -aryl radical bonded<br>
to the molecule via a (C1-C8) -alkyl radical.<br>
A (C3-C18)-heteroaryl radical within the framework of the<br>
invention refers to a five-, six- or seven-membered<br>
aromatic ring system of 3 to 18 C atoms, which contains<br>
heteroatoms such as e.g. nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur in the<br>
ring. In particular, radicals such as 1-, 2-, 3-furyl,<br>
such as 1-, 2-, 3-pyrrolyl, 1-, 2-, 3-thienyl, 2-, 3-,<br>
4-pyridyl, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-, 7-indolyl, 3-, 4-,<br>
5-pyrazolyl, 2-, 4-, 5-imidazolyl, acridinyl, quinolinyl,<br>
phenanthridinyl and 2-, 4-, 5-, 6-pyrimidinyl are<br>
considered as such heteroaromatics.<br>
A (C4-C19)-heteroaralkyl means a heteroaromatic system<br>
corresponding to the (C7-C19)-aralkyl radical.<br>
Fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine are suitable as<br>
halogens (Hal).<br>
PEG means polyethylene glycol.<br>
The term enantiomer-enriched or enantiomeric excess within<br>
the framework of the invention means the proportion of an<br>
enantiomer in a mixture with its optical antipode in a<br>
range of &gt;50 % and 
follows:<br>
([Enantiomerl]-[Enantiomer2])/([Enantiomerl]+[Enantiomer2])=ee value<br>
The naming of the complexes and ligands according to the<br>
invention contains, within the framework of the invention,<br>
all possible diastereomers, the two optical antipodes of<br>
any diastereomer also being included therein.<br>
The complexes and catalysts described here determine, with<br>
their configuration, the optical induction in the product.<br>
It goes without saying that the catalysts, when used<br>
racemically, also yield racemic product. A subsequent<br>
resolution of racemates then yields the enantiomer-<br>
enriched products again. However, this is part of the<br>
general knowledge of the person skilled in the art.<br>
N-Acyl groups mean protective groups that are<br>
conventionally used in amino acid chemistry for the<br>
protection of nitrogen atoms. The following can be<br>
particularly mentioned in this capacity: formyl, acetyl,<br>
Moc, Eoc, phthalyl, Boc, Alloc, Z, Fmoc, etc.<br>
The literature references cited in this document are<br>
deemed to be contained in the disclosure.<br>
Within the framework of the invention, membrane reactor<br>
means any reaction vessel in which the molecular weight-<br>
enlarged catalyst is enclosed in a reactor while low<br>
molecular weight substances are fed into the reactor or<br>
can leave it. The membrane can be integrated directly into<br>
the reaction chamber or can be installed outside it in a<br>
separate filtration module, in which the reaction solution<br>
flows continuously or intermittently through the<br>
filtration module and the retentate is recycled into the<br>
reactor. Suitable embodiments are described in W098/22415<br>
and in Wandrey et al. in Jahrbuch 1998, Verfahrenstechnik<br>
und Chemieingenieurwesen, VDI p. 151 ff.; Wandrey et al.<br>
in Applied Homogeneous Catalysis with Organometallic<br>
Compounds, Vol. 2, VCH 1996, p. 832 ff.; Kragl et al.,<br>
Angew. Chem. 1996, 6, 684 f., among others.<br>
Within the framework of the invention, a polymer-enlarged<br>
ligand/complex means one in which the molecular weight-<br>
enlarging polymer is covalently bonded to the ligand.<br>
Descriptions of the drawings:<br>
Fig. 1 shows a membrane reactor with dead-end filtration.<br>
The substrate 1 is transferred via a pump 2 into the<br>
reactor chamber 3, which has a membrane 5. In the<br>
agitator-driven reactor chamber, in addition to the<br>
solvent, the catalyst 4, the product 6 and unreacted<br>
substrate 1 are found. Mainly low-molecular weight<br>
substances 6 are filtered off through the membrane 5.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a membrane reactor with cross-flow<br>
filtration. Here, the substrate 7 is transferred via the<br>
pump 8 into the agitated reactor chamber, in which<br>
solvent, catalyst 9 and product 14 are also found. By<br>
means of the pump 16 a solvent flow is set up, which<br>
passes via an optionally present heat exchanger 12 into<br>
the cross-flow filtration cell 15. Here the low molecular-<br>
weight product 14 is separated off by means of the<br>
membrane 13. High molecular-weight catalyst 9 is then<br>
passed back into the reactor 10 with the solvent flow,<br>
optionally via a heat exchanger 12 again, optionally via<br>
the valve 11.<br>
Examples:<br>
General<br>
Reactions of air-sensitive compounds were performed in an<br>
argon-filled glove box or in standard Schlenk tubes.<br>
Solvents tetrahydrofuran (THF), diethyl ether and<br>
dichloromethane were degassed and purified by means of<br>
solvent-drying equipment (Innovative Technologies) by<br>
filtration through a column filled with activated<br>
aluminium oxide; toluene and pentane were additionally<br>
freed of oxygen by a column filled with a copper catalyst.<br>
The following examples serve to explain the invention.<br>
They are not in any way intended to represent a<br>
limitation.<br>
Example 1: (R,R)-2,5-Dimethyl-1-phenyl-phospholane<br>
One equivalent of n-BuLi (8.9 ml, 1.6 M. solution in n-<br>
hexane) is added slowly to a solution of 1.57 g<br>
phenylphosphine (14.3 mmol) in 100 ml of THF at -78 °C.<br>
This is then stirred for a further two hours at room<br>
temperature. After cooling again to -78 °C, one equivalent<br>
of the cyclic sulfate 1 in 10 ml of THF is added via a<br>
cannula and the reaction is allowed to end by stirring at<br>
25°C for 3 hours. Before adding a further 1.2 eq. of n-<br>
BuLi (9.8 ml) via syringe, the mixture is cooled again, n-<br>
BuLi is added and stirring is continued overnight. For the<br>
work-up, the solvent was drawn off in vacuo and the<br>
residue taken up in 5 ml of water and extracted with 50 ml<br>
of methylene chloride. After the phase separation the<br>
solvent is removed and the residue is distilled in vacuo.<br>
An almost colourless syrup is obtained in a yield of 71 %<br>
(1.95 g).<br>

(Tetrahedron: Asymmetry 1991, 2, 569-592), 3.06 g (15.9<br>
mmol) of (R,R) -2, 5-dimethyl-1-phenyl-phospholane in<br>
approx. 100 ml THF is taken at room temperature and 2.5<br>
equivalents of lithium are added. The mixture is stirred<br>
overnight. The resulting deep-red suspension is separated<br>
from the lithium using a cannula and 2 equivalents of<br>
chlorotrimethylsilane (3.46 g) are slowly added at 0°C<br>
using a syringe. Towards the end of the reaction, the<br>
reaction solution becomes almost colourless. The solution<br>
is concentrated in vacuo to 60-70% of its volume and the<br>
precipitated lithium salts are filtered off. After<br>
complete evaporation, the residue is distilled under<br>
reduced pressure and the silyl compound is obtained in a<br>
yield of 1.43 g (48%) as a colourless, liquid compound.<br>
The 31P-NMR spectrum discloses the presence of two species<br>
in a ratio of approx. 3:1. Based on an evaluation of the<br>
NMR signals, it is obviously the desired chiral silyl<br>
phospholane and the corresponding meso-compound.<br>
Isomerisation reactions of this type have already been<br>
described by Burk (Tetrahedron: Asymmetry 1991, 2,<br>
569-592). Since, in the subsequent reaction with<br>
dichloromaleic anhydride, only one diastereomer<br>
crystallises out, this mixture of isomers could be used<br>
for the nucleophilic reaction without prior separation.<br>

Example 3: (R,R) -2,5-Dimethyl-1-trimethylsilyl-phospholane<br>
To a solution of 9.50 g of tris(trimethylsilyl)phosphine<br>
(37.9 mmol) in 300 ml of THF are added 1.05 eq. of MeLi<br>
(28.4 ml, 1.4 M solution in ether), slowly, at room<br>
temperature. Stirring is then continued overnight at room<br>
temperature and the solvent is then removed under vacuum.<br>
The residue is now taken up with 300 ml of ether and one<br>
equivalent of the cyclic sulfate is added (6.83 g in<br>
100 ml of ether) dropwise to the lithium salt solution.<br>
After three hours, 28.4 ml of MeLi solution are again<br>
added to the reaction mixture using a syringe. To complete<br>
the reaction, the mixture is stirred overnight. For the<br>
workup, the solvent is removed in vacuo and the residue is<br>
carefully distilled in vacuo. A colourless, mobile syrup<br>
is obtained in a yield of 70% (5.0 g).<br>

Example 4: 2,3-Bis[(R,R)-2,5-dimethyl-phospholanyl]maleic<br>
anhydride<br>
According to the specification by Fenske et al. (Chem. Ber.<br>
1974, 107, 117-122) 450 mg (2.4 mmol) of the<br>
diastereomeric mixture of the silyl compound 3 were added<br>
dropwise using a syringe over a period of 15 minutes to a<br>
solution of 200 mg of 2,3-dichloromaleic anhydride (0.5<br>
eq.) in 5 ml of diethyl ether at 0°C. The mixture was then<br>
kept at -78°C overnight. The dark reddish-brown crystals<br>
that precipitated were isolated from the solvent by bag<br>
filtration and then dried. Yield.190 mg (49%).<br>
In the NMR of the isolated compound, only one diastereomer<br>
of a C2-symmetrical compound is found. This is the proof<br>
that the corresponding meso-silylphosphine, which was<br>
added to the reaction in a deficiency, either has not<br>
reacted or the corresponding diastereomeric products do<br>
not crystallise out. With this observation, a partial<br>
racemisation in the synthesis of the {R,R)-2,5-dimethyl-1-<br>
trimethylsilyl-phospholane can also be simultaneously<br>
ruled out. Its use should lead to diastereomeric<br>
bisphospholanes after phosphinylation, and these were not<br>
detected.<br>
