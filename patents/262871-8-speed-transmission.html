				<td>8-SPEED TRANSMISSION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]	The present invention relates to a power transmission having three planetary<br>
gear sets that are controlled by six torque-transmitting devices to provide eight forward speed<br>
ratios and one reverse speed ratio.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	Passenger vehicles include a powertrain that is comprised of an engine, multi-<br>
speed transmission, and a differential or final drive. The multi-speed transmission increases<br>
the overall operating range of the vehicle by permitting the engine to operate through its torque<br>
range a number of times. The number of forward speed ratios that are available in the<br>
transmission determines the number of times the engine torque range is repeated. Early<br>
automatic transmissions had two speed ranges. This severely limited the overall speed range<br>
of the vehicle and therefore required a relatively large engine that could produce a wide speed<br>
and torque range. This resulted in the engine operating at a specific fuel consumption point<br>
during cruising, other than the most efficient point. Therefore, manually-shifted (countershaft<br>
transmissions) were the most popular.<br>
[0003]	With the advent of three- and four-speed automatic transmissions, the automatic<br>
shifting (planetary gear) transmission increased in popularity with the motoring public. These<br>
transmissions improved the operating performance and fuel economy of the vehicle. The<br>
increased number of speed ratios reduces the step size between ratios and therefore improves<br>
the shift quality of the transmission by making the ratio interchanges substantially<br>
imperceptible to the operator under normal vehicle acceleration.<br>
[0004]	Six-speed transmissions offer several advantages over four- and five-speed<br>
transmissions, including improved vehicle acceleration and improved fuel economy. While<br>
many trucks employ power transmissions having six or more forward speed ratios, passenger<br><br>
cars are still manufactured with three- and four-speed automatic transmissions and relatively<br>
few five or six-speed devices due to the size and complexity of these transmissions.<br>
[0005]	Seven-, eight- and nine-speed transmissions provide further improvements in<br>
acceleration and fuel economy over six-speed transmissions. However, like the six-speed<br>
transmissions discussed above, the development of seven-, eight- and nine-speed transmissions<br>
has been precluded because of complexity, size and cost.<br>
SUMMARY OF THIS INVENTION<br>
[0006]	It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved transmission<br>
having three planetary gear sets controlled to provide eight forward speed ratios and one<br>
reverse speed ratio.<br>
[0007]	The transmission family of the present invention has three planetary gear sets,<br>
each of which includes a first, second and third member, which members may comprise a sun<br>
gear, a ring gear, or a planet carrier assembly member, in any order.<br>
[0008]	In referring to the first, second and third gear sets in this description and in the<br>
claims, these sets may be counted "first" to "third" in any order in the drawing (i.e., left to<br>
right, right to left, etc.). Additionally, the first, second or third members of each gear set may<br>
be counted "first" to "third" in any order in the drawing (i.e., top to bottom, bottom to top,<br>
etc.) for each gear set.<br>
[0009]	Each carrier member can be either a single-pinion carrier member (simple) or a<br>
double-pinion carrier member (compound). Embodiments with long pinions are also possible.<br>
[0010]	A first interconnecting member continuously connects the third member of the<br>
second planetary gear set with the first member of the third planetary gear set.<br>
[0011]	A second interconnecting member continuously connects the third member of<br>
the first planetary gear set with the second member of the second planetary gear set.<br>
[0012]	A first torque transmitting device, such a brake, selectively connects the second<br>
member of the third planetary gear set with a stationary member (transmission housing/casing).<br><br>
[0013]	A second torque transmitting device, such as a brake, selectively connects the<br>
first member of the second planetary gear set with a stationary member (transmission<br>
housing/casing).<br>
[0014]	A third torque transmitting device, such as a clutch, selectively connects the<br>
first member of the second planetary gear set with the third member of the second planetary<br>
gear set.<br>
[0015]	A fourth torque transmitting device, such as a clutch, selectively connects the<br>
third member of the second planetary gear set with the second member of the first planetary<br>
gear set.<br>
[0016]	A fifth torque transmitting device, such as a clutch, selectively connects the<br>
second member of the first planetary gear set with the second member of the third planetary<br>
gear set.<br>
[0017]	A sixth torque transmitting device, such as a clutch, selectively connects the<br>
first member of the first planetary gear set with the second member of the third planetary gear<br>
set.<br>
[0018]	The six torque transmitting mechanisms are selectively engageable in<br>
combinations of three to yield eight forward speed ratios and one reverse speed ratio.<br>
[0019]	A variety of speed ratios and ratio spreads can be realized by suitably selecting<br>
the tooth ratios of the planetary gear sets.<br>
[0020]	The above features and other features and advantages of the present invention<br>
are readily apparent from the following detailed description of the best modes for carrying out<br>
the invention when taken in connection with the accompanying drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING<br>
[0021]	FIGURK 1a is a schematic representation of a powertrain including a planetary<br>
transmission in accordance with the present invention; and<br><br>
[0022]	FIGURE 1b is a truth table and chart depicting some of the operating<br>
characteristics of the powertrain shown in Figure la.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
[0023]	Referring to the drawings, there is shown in Figure la a powertrain 10 having a<br>
conventional engine and torque converter 12, a planetary transmission 14, and a conventional<br>
final drive mechanism 16. The engine 12 may be powered using various types of fuel to<br>
improve the efficiency and fuel economy of a particular application. Such fuels may include,<br>
for example, gasoline; diesel; ethanol; dimethyl ether; etc.<br>
[0024]	The planetary transmission 14 includes an input member 17 continuously<br>

[0028]	The planetary gear arrangement also includes six torque-transmitting<br>
mechanisms 50, 52, 54, 55, 56 and 57. The torque-transmitting mechanisms 50 and 52 are a<br><br>
stationary-type torque-transmitting mechanism, commonly termed brakes or reaction clutches.<br>
The torque-transmitting mechanisms 54, 55, 56 and 57 are rotating-type torque-transmitting<br>
mechanisms, commonly termed clutches.<br>
[0029]	The input member 17 is continuously connected with the sun gear member 22 of<br>
the planetary gear set 20. The output member 19 is continuously connected with the ring gear<br>
member 44 of the planetary gear set 40. The first interconnecting member 70 continuously<br>
connects the ring gear member 34 of the planetary gear set 30 with the sun gear member 42 of<br>
the planetary gear set 40. The second interconnecting member 72 continuously connects the<br>
ring gear member 24 of the planetary gear set 20 with the carrier member 36 of the planetary<br>
gear set 30.<br>
[0030]	A first torque transmitting device, such as brake 50, selectively connects the<br>
planet carrier assembly member 46 of the planetary gear set 40 with the transmission housing<br>
60. A second torque transmitting device, such as brake 52, selectively connects the sun gear<br>
member 32 of the planetary gear set 30 with the transmission housing 60. A third torque<br>
transmitting device, such as clutch 54, selectively connects the sun gear member 32 of the<br>
planetary gear set 30 with the ring gear member 34 of the planetary gear set 30 and the sun<br>
gear member 42 of the planetary gear set 40 via interconnecting member 70. A fourth torque<br>

26 of the planetary gear set 20 with the ring gear member 34 of the planetary gear set 30 and<br>
the sun gear member 42 of the planetary gear set 40 via interconnecting member 70. A fifth<br>
torque transmitting device, such as clutch 56, selectively connects the planet carrier assembly<br>
member 26 of the planetary gear set 20 with the planet carrier assembly member 46 of the<br>
planetary gear set 40. A sixth torque transmitting device, such as clutch 57, selectively<br>
connects the sun gear member 22 of the planetary gear set 20 with the planet carrier assembly<br>
member 46 of the planetary gear set 40.<br>
[0031]	As shown in Figure 1b, and in particular the truth table disclosed therein, the<br>
torque-transmitting mechanisms are selectively engaged in combinations of three to provide<br><br>
eight forward speed ratios and one reverse speed ratio all with single transition shifts with a<br>
double overdrive.<br>
[0032]	The reverse speed ratio is established with the engagement of the brakes 50, 52<br>
and clutch 55. The brake 50 engages the planet carrier assembly member 46 with the<br>
transmission housing 60. The brake 52 engages the sun gear member 32 with the transmission<br>
housing 60. The clutch 55 engages the planet carrier assembly member 26 with the ring gear<br>

member 26, ring gear member 34 and sun gear member 42 rotate at the same speed. The ring<br>
gear member 24 and planet carrier assembly member 36 rotate at the same speed. The speed<br>
of the ring gear member 24 is determined from the speed of the sun gear member 22, the speed<br>
of the planet carrier assembly member 26 and the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratio of the<br>
planetary gear set 20. The sun gear member 32 does not rotate. The speed of the ring gear<br>

same speed. The speed of the ring gear member 44, and therefore the output member 19, is<br>
determined from the speed of the sun gear member 42 and the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratio of<br>
the planetary gear set 40. The numerical value of the reverse speed ratio is determined utilizing<br>
the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratios of the planetary gear sets 20, 30 and 40.<br>

determined utilizing the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratios of the planetary gear sets 20 and 40.<br>

numerical value of the eighth forward speed ratio is determined utilizing the ring gear/sun gear<br>
tooth ratios of the planetary gear set 40.<br>
[0041]	As set forth above, the engagement schedule for the torque-transmitting<br>
mechanisms is shown in the truth table of Figure 1b. This truth table also provides an example<br>
of speed ratios that are available in the above-described transmission. Also, the chart of<br>
Figure 1b describes the ratio steps that are attained in the above described transmission. For<br>
example, the step ratio between the first and second forward speed ratios is 1.44, while the<br>
step ratio between the reverse speed ratio and first forward ratio is -0.72.<br>
[0042]	The powertrain 10 may share components with a hybrid vehicle, and such a<br>
combination may be operable in a 'charge-depleting mode". For purposes of the present<br>
invention, a "charge-depleting mode" is a mode wherein the vehicle is powered primarily by an<br>
electric motor/generator such that a battery is depleted or nearly depleted when the vehicle<br>
reaches its destination. In other words, during the charge-depleting mode, the engine 12 is only<br><br>
operated to the extent necessary to ensure that the battery is not depleted before the destination is<br>
reached. A conventional hybrid vehicle operates in a "charge-sustaining mode", wherein if the<br>
battery charge level drops below a predetermined level (e.g., 25%) the engine is automatically<br>
run to recharge the battery. Therefore, by operating in a charge-depleting mode, the hybrid<br>
vehicle can conserve some or all of the fuel that would otherwise be expended to maintain the<br>
25% battery charge level in a conventional hybrid vehicle. It should be appreciated that a hybrid<br>
vehicle powertrain is preferably only operated in the charge-depleting mode if the battery can be<br>
recharged after the destination is reached by plugging it into an energy source.<br>
[0043]	While the best modes for carrying out the invention have been described in<br>
detail, those familiar with the art to which this invention relates will recognize various<br>
alternative designs and embodiments for practicing the invention within the scope of the<br>
