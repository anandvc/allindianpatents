				<td>A MOVER ASSEMBLY OF A RECIPROCATING MOTOR<br>
AND METHOD OF FABRICATION THEREOF<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates a mover assembly of a reciprocating motor and its<br>
fabrication method, and more particularly, to a mover of a reciprocating motor that is<br>
capable of firmly and easily fixing permanent magnets, and its fabrication method.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
In general, a reciprocating motor is formed by modifying an induction magnetic<br>
field of a motor with a cubic structure to a flat shape, so that a fiat shaped mover is<br>
mounted at an upper side of a stator formed flat and moved linearly according to a<br>
magnetic field change.<br>
Recently, a reciprocating motor has been introduced that a stator is separated<br>
into an outer stator and an inner stator formed in a cylindrical shape which are<br>
arranged overlapped with a certain gap therebetween, a mover assembly is movably<br>
disposed between the outer stator and the inner stator, a winding coil is mounted at<br>
either one of the outer stator and the inner stator, and permanent magnets are<br>
attached at the corresponding mover assembly, so that the mover can be reciprocally<br>
moved in an axial direction of the reciprocating motor by an induction magnetic field<br>
generated by the winding coil.<br>
As shown in Figure 1, a conventional reciprocating motor comprises: a stator 10<br>
forming an induction magnetic field, and a mover assembly 20 reciprocally moved<br>
according to the induction magnetic field of the stator 10.<br>
The stator 10 includes an outer stator 11 formed in a hollow cylindrical shape as<br>
a plurality of laminations are stacked and having a winding coil (C) therein, and an<br>
inner stator 12 formed in a hollow cylindrical shape as a plurality of iron pieces are<br>
stacked and inserted into the outer stator 11 with a certain gap therebetween.<br>
The mover assembly 20 includes a mover body 21 formed in a cylindrical shape<br>
and disposed movably between the outer stator 11 and the inner stator 12, permanent<br>
magnets 22 mounted at equal intervals at an outer circumference surface of the mover<br>
body 21 corresponding to the winding coil (C) of the stator 10, and a magnet cover 12<br>
formed in a cylindrical shape to cover the permanent magnets 22, and forcibly press-<br>
fit, bent or welded to the outer circumferential surface of the permanent magnets 22.<br>
Reference numeral 21a is a permanent magnet mounting groove.<br>
The operation of the conventional reciprocating motor for a compressor will now<br>
be described.<br>
When a current is applied to the winding coil (C), an induction magnetic field is<br>
formed in different directions between the outer stator 11 and the inner stator 12<br>
according to the direction of the current. The mover body 21 is reciprocally moved<br>
together with the permanent magnets 22 as they are drawn or pushed according to the<br>
direction of the induction magnetic field.<br>
If a piston (not shown) is coupled at the mover body 21, the piston is<br>
reciprocally moved in a cylinder (not shown) together with the mover assembly 20,<br>
thereby compressing a fluid.<br>
However, in the conventional reciprocating motor, as shown in Figure 2, the<br>
permanent magnet cover 23 is formed in a cylindrical shape, but in case of the<br>
permanent magnets (M), there occurs a height difference (h) due to a processing error<br>
of each permanent magnet (M). Thus, causing a difficulty in the press-fit operation,<br>
and the permanent magnets 12 may be broken if they are forcibly press-fit or released<br>
from the mover body.<br>
In order to solve the problem, the .permanent magnet cover 23 may be press-fit<br>
and then fixed by a spot welding. In this respect, however, since the permanent<br>
magnet cover 23 is made of a thin plate material, there is a difficulty in the welding<br>
operation, and even if the welding is performed, its strength is weak, resulting in that<br>
the permanent magnet cover may be released.<br>
In addition, for welding, the mover body 21 is limited to the metallic material,<br>
and if the metallic material is used, a magnetic force is leaked to degrade an efficiency<br>
of the motor.<br><br>
TECHNICAL GIST OF THE PESENT INVENTION<br>
Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide a mover assembly of<br>
a reciprocating motor which is capable of easily and firmly fixing the permanent<br>
magnets to a cylindrical mover body, and its fabrication method.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a mover assembly of a<br>
reciprocating motor of which a mover body can be fabricated with a non-magnetic<br>
material and non-conductive material in order to prevent leakage of magnetic force of<br>
a permanent magnet.<br>

MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The present invention will now be described with reference to accompanying<br>
drawings.<br>
As shown in Figure 3, a mover assembly 100 of a reciprocating motor of the<br>
present invention comprises: a mover body 110 formed in a cylindrical shape and<br>
disposed movable between an outer stator(11) and an inner stator 12; permanent<br>
magnets 120 mounted at an outer circumferential surface of the mover body 110 at<br>
equal intervals corresponding to a winding coil (C) of the outer stator 11; and a mixed<br>
member 130 for covering and fixing the permanent magnets 120.<br><br>
As shown in Figure 4, preferably, the mover body 110 includes a slope side<br>
112, at the outer circumferential surface, gradually lowered as it goes away from the<br>
permanent magnet 120 in consideration of the strength of the mixed member 130<br>
when projected from the side or from the front side, and a hole 140 is formed to<br>
reduce a fluid resistance when the mover body 110 is reciprocally moved.<br>
In consideration of magnetic leakage, the mover body 110 is preferably molded<br>
by a non-magnetic metal or more preferably molded by a non-magnetic and non-<br>
conductive plastic material.<br>
Especially, in case of the plastic material, carbon fiber or glass fiber is mixed as<br>
a reinforcing material with the plastic material for molding.<br>
The permanent magnets 120 may be formed with a circular arc-shaped section<br>
by having the same length of the inner circumferential face and the outer<br>
circumferential face when projected from the front side so as to correspond to the<br>
outer circumferential face of the mover body 110. According to circumferences, a<br>
permanent magnet mounting groove 111 can be formed flat so that the permanent<br>
magnets 120 are formed in a rectangular shape.<br>
Between the permanent magnets 120, a resin 132 of the mixed member 130 is<br>
infiltrated to fill the space between the permanent magnets 120.<br>
The mixed member 130 is formed as a fiber 131 such as a carbon fiber, a glass<br>
fiber or a cablor fiber and the resin 132 such as epoxy and polyester or penol are<br>
mixed and formed in a sheet or a wire shape.<br>
A plurality of fibers 131 are arranged side by side in only one direction with a<br>
certain width, or may be plaited in a 'cross stripes' shape or a 'grid' shape to double<br>
the pressing force.<br>
The mixed member 130 has a circumferential directional texture 130a on the<br>
circumferential surface to contain a certain roughness or at least one parting line<br>
according to its hardening method.<br>
That is, as shown in Figure 6, in case that the mixed member 130 is hardened<br>
by winding with a pressing film (P), the texture 130a is generated, and as shown in<br>
Figure 7, in case that the mixed member 130 is hardened by covering a mold (M)<br>
thereon, the parting line 130b is created.<br><br>
In the aspect of the strength, it is preferred that the mixed member 130 is<br>
formed around up to hole 140 provided at the side of the mover body 110.<br>
The process for fabricating the mover assembly of a reciprocating motor will<br>
now be described with reference to Figures 8, 9 and 10.<br>
First, in case that the mover body 110 is made of a metal material, it is<br>
thermally treated at a certain temperature in order to remove the magnetism.<br>
Meanwhile, in case that the mover body 110 is made of a resin, a non-metal material,<br>
a reinforcing material such as a carbon fiber or a glass fiber is added to the resin and<br>
roughly molded, the portion where the permanent magnet 120 is to be mounted is<br>
ground by post-processing, and then the permanent magnets 120 are arranged at the<br>
outer circumference of the mover body 110 at equal intervals.<br>
At this time, the outer circumferential face of the mover body 110 includes a<br>
slope face 112 which is lowered down in its height as it is distanced from the<br>
permanent magnet mounting groove 111 so that when the mixed member 130<br>
becomes thick, the strength of the mixed member 130 is intensified, thereby more<br>
firmly fixing the permanent magnets 120.<br>
Next, the sheet or wire-shaped fiber 131 is induced into a resin receptacle 150<br>
filled with the resin 132, in which the fiber 131 and the resin 132 are mixed to fabricate<br>
the mixed member 130, which is induced to a position where it winds the mover body<br>
110 to thereby cover the permanent magnets 120.<br>
For forming the mixed member 130, there may be used a so-called 'dry<br>
technique' wherein the fiber 131 and the resin 132 are pre-mixed in advance, which<br>
covers the permanent magnets 120 in a little dried state (a pre-preg state), or there<br>
may be used a so-called 'wet technique' in which the fiber 131 is infiltrated into the<br>
resin 132 just before covering the permanent magnets 120.<br>
As shown in Figure 8, specifically, the 'dry technique' is that the mover body<br>
110 with the permanent magnets 120 attached thereto is fixed at a rotor (not shown)<br>
and a mixed member roll 200 with the mixed member 130 wound thereon is disposed<br>
at the opposite side so that the mixed member 130 covers the permanent magnets<br>
120 in the pre-preg state while rotating the mover body 110.<br><br>
As shown in Figure 9, the 'wet-technique' is that the mover body 110 with the<br>
permanent magnets 120 attached thereon is fixed at a rotor (not shown), a fiber roll<br>
300 with fiber wound thereon is disposed at the opposite side, a resin receptacle 150<br>
filled with resin 132 is disposed between the mover body 110, and the fiber roll 300,<br>
the fiber 131 is first infiltrated into the resin 132 so as to be mixed and then covers the<br>
permanent magnets 120 of the mover body 110.<br>
Finally, in a state that the mixed member 130 is covered with the pressing film<br>
(P) to maintain its form so that the mixed member 130 can be maintained in a certain<br>
form, it is plastic-worked and hardened by a hardening means such as a hot blast, or<br>
in a state that the mixed member 130 is inserted in a mold of a certain shape made of<br>
silicon to maintain its form, and the mixed member 130 is plastic-worked and<br>
hardened by hot blast, so that the mixed member 130 firmly fixes the permanent<br>
magnets 120.<br>
If the form of the mixed member 130 is maintained by using the pressing film<br>
(P), the texture 130a remains in a circular arc direction to have a certain roughness<br>
after the pressing film (P) is removed. If the metal mold (M) is used, the parting line<br>
130b is left at a junction portion of the upper mold and the lower mold<br>
In this manner, the permanent magnets are fixed by using the mixed member<br>
obtained by mixing the fiber and the resin and the mixed member is hardened so that<br>
the permanent magnets are attached to the mover body. Accordingly, even if the<br>
permanent magnets are mounted unevenly due to a processing error, since the mixed<br>
member is uniformly pressed at the outer circumferential face of each permanent<br>
magnet before being hardened. Thus, the permanent magnets can be firmly and<br>
easily attached.<br>
In addition, since the member for fixing the permanent magnets is made of the<br>
resin or the like, the mover body can be also made of a non-magnetic and non-<br>
conductive resin. Thus, leakage of a magnetic force can be prevented to improve an<br>
efficiency of the motor.<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
As so far described, according to the mover assembly of a reciprocating motor<br>
and its fabrication method, the permanent magnets are arranged at an outer<br>
circumferential face of the mover body, covered with the mixed member obtained by<br>
mixing a fiber and a resin, and hardened to be fixed. Therefore, the permanent<br>
magnets can be firmly and easily fixed at the mover body. In addition, by molding the<br>
mover body with a non-magnetic and non-conductive material, leakage of the<br>
magnetic force of the permanent magnets can be prevented.<br>
