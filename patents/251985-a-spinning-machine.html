				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to a spinning machine. The drive can in principle concern any possible spinning machine drive.<br>
In certain cases the respective spinning machine drive needs to be able to rotate both in the one as well as in the other direction. The direction of rotation must therefore be reversible.<br>
It is the object of the present invention to provide a spinning machine of the kind mentioned above which in a simple and reliable way allows an operation of the respective spinning machine drive in the one direction of rotation or an operation of the spinning machine drive in the other direction of rotation.<br>
This object is achieved in accordance with the invention in such a way that the frequency converter is designed to trigger the drive in the one direction of rotation as well as to trigger the drive in the other direction of rotation and is provided with at least one respective control input.<br>
Based on this arrangement it is possible with minimal effort to provide a reliable changeover of the respective spinning machine drive between the two directions of rotation.<br>
In an advantageous embodiment of the spinning machine in accordance with the invention, the direction of rotation of the drive can be changed through the control input, e.g. by changing at least one parameter of the frequency converter (power inverter, from direct current to alternating current). Generally, a single control input is usually sufficient for such a new or re-parameterization of the frequency converter. As a result, a data record can be transmitted serially to the frequency converter for example through such a control input. A single communications line is sufficient for activation for example.<br><br>
In another advantageous embodiment the frequency converter is provided with two separate control inputs.<br>
In a preferred practical embodiment the frequency converter is provided with two separate control inputs corresponding to the two opposite directions of rotation. In this case the two control inputs can be optionally activated by a relay in particular.<br>
Appropriately, a freewheeling diode is switched in parallel to the coil of the relay.<br>
The relay can advantageously be activated through a digital control output of the central machine control unit.<br>
In an appropriate embodiment of the spinning machine in accordance with the invention, the relay comprises a changeover contact cooperating with the two control inputs of the frequency converter, which changeover contact is preferably provided in an enable line associated with the frequency converter.<br>
The respective direction of rotation can be predetermined by way of an operator control unit which is connected with the central machine control unit.<br>
The predetermination of a respective direction of rotation is preferably performed by way of a respective parameterization.<br>
In an appropriate practical embodiment of the spinning machine in accordance with the invention, the central machine control unit is designed in such a way that an intermediate stop is caused at first in the case of a respective change of direction of rotation of the drive.<br>
Means can be provided in order to signalize or display a respective change of direction of rotation. The signaling or display means can preferably be triggered by way of the central machine control unit.<br><br>
If further frequency converters are provided which are used especially to activate one or several spinning machine drives, it is advantageous if at least a part of said further frequency converters are charged via a common intermediate circuit which can be charged with direct voltage via at least one frequency converter associated with the drive(s).<br>
Preferably, the central machine control unit is also supplied via the intermediate circuit. The central machine control unit can be connected in particular through a DC/DC-converter.<br>
The respective spinning machine drive can concern any drive whose direction of rotation needs to be reversed at least temporarily.<br>
Thus, the drive can be a spindle drive for example.<br>
Up until now, ring spinning machines were configured for the so-called "Z-twist" direction of rotation of the spindles. In certain cases, however, a so-called "S-twist" direction of rotation is desirable. These Z- and S-twists of the yarn concern two mutually opposite directions of rotation, which provides in the one case a Z-like and in the other case an S-like yarn configuration.<br>
In order to enable in the simplest and most reliable manner an optional operation within the terms of an Z-twist direction of rotation or an operation within the terms of an S-twist direction of rotation, the frequency converter is designed in a preferred practical embodiment of the spinning machine in accordance with the invention both for an activation of the spindle drive in the direction of rotation corresponding to a Z-twist of the yarn as well as an activation of the spindle drive in the other direction of rotation corresponding to an S-twist of the yarn.<br>
As a result of this arrangement, a reliable changeover is therefore possible with minimal effort between two types of operation producing a Z-twist and an S-twist of the yarn.<br><br>
The respective drive can concern a ring frame drive or a doffer drive, because it is known that both the ring frame drive as well as the doffer drive need to reverse.<br>
The respective drive can also especially concern a drafting arrangement drive. The frequency converter in accordance with the invention can then be used to preferably activate said drafting arrangement drive in such a way that it runs back over a predeterminable rotational angle after the deactivation of the spinning machine, as is indicated in the as yet unpublished DE 100 11 190.4. This ensures in particular that no impermissible wrong drafts occur after a deactivation process and a renewed start-up of the machine. As a result, there is the tendency towards ever longer machines in the development of ring spinning machines. Usually, drive units for the drafting rollers are provided at the end of the machines. As a result of the increasing length of the drafting rollers, the torsion of the drafting rollers becomes so high that after the deactivation and renewed start-up of the spinning machine thick or thin places can occur in the yarn because the free ends of the drafting rollers twist by up to 30" during their gradual twisting, thus enabling the occurrence of wrong drafts in the fiber structure that are disposed in the drafting arrangement at the time. Such wrong drafts can now be avoided by driving back the drafting arrangement drive by a predeterminable rotational angle after the deactivation of the spinning machine, which is possible in a simple and reliable manner by the frequency converter in accordance with the invention.<br>
The drafting arrangement drive can be activated by way of the frequency actuator in accordance with the invention in such a way that said drafting arrangement drive runs backwardly in one or several steps within a predetermined period after the deactivation of the spinning machine.<br>
Principally, such an activation of the drafting arrangement drive is also possible in which the same is driven backwardly for such a time until the drive-sided end of the drafting roller has been turned back by a predetermined angle.<br><br>
The invention is now explained in closer detail by reference to embodiments shown in the drawings, wherein;<br>
Fig. 1 shows a purely schematic, simplified partial representation of an embodiment of a ring spinning machine shown as an example, which shows especially the power distribution of the machine;<br>
Fig. 2      shows a purely schematic, simplified partial representation of the ring spinning machine according to fig. 1, especially revealing the signal lines provided between the central machine control unit and the frequency converters as well as the relay used for changing over the direction of rotation;<br>
Fig. 3      shows an enlarged schematic representation of the relay which is disposed<br>
between the central control unit and the respective frequency converter of the ring spinning machine and is used for changing the direction of rotation, and<br>
Fig. 4      shows the progress of the twisting of a drafting roller under different conditions.<br>
The ring spinning machine 10, shown in figs. 1 and 2 in a purely schematic partial representation, comprises at least one electric spinning place or spindle drive 12, electric drafting arrangement drives 14, 16 as well as at least one electnc ring frame or ring rail drive 18 which are each activated through frequency actuators or converters 20 - 26. The various frequency actuators 20 - 26 can be activated through a central control unit 28 of ring spinning machine 10.<br>
The drafting arrangement drives 14, which are activated through frequency converters 22, are associated with the input and middle rollers, and the drafting arrangement drives 16, which are activated by the frequency converters 24, are associated with the output rollers. In the present case a total of eight drafting arrangement drives 14, 16 are provided.<br><br>
The frequency converter 20 is designed for activating the spindle drive 12 in the direction of rotation corresponding especially to the Z-twist of the yarn as well as for activating the spindle drive 12 in the other direction of rotation corresponding especially to an S-twist of the yarn. For this purpose the frequency converter 20 is provided with two separate control inputs 29, 30 which correspond to the two opposite directions of rotation and which can be activated alternatingly via a relay 31 (cf. figs. 2 and 3 in particular).<br>
A freewheeling diode 33 is switched in parallel to the coil 32 of relay 31.<br>
Relay 31 can be triggered through a digital control output 11 of the central machine control unit 28.<br>
In the present embodiment, the relay 31 comprises a changeover contact 13 which cooperates with the two control inputs 29, 30 of the frequency converter 20 and is preferably disposed in an enable line 15 associated with the frequency converter 20.<br>
The respective direction of rotation can be predetermined by way of an operator control unit 42 (cf. fig. 2) which is connected with the central machine control unit 28. A respective predetermination of the direction of rotation can be made through a respective parameterization.<br>
The central machine control unit 28 is preferably designed in such a way that in the case of a respective changeover of the direction of rotation of the spindle drive 12, an intermediate stop is effected.<br>
Means (not shown) can be provided in order to signalize or display a respective change of direction of rotation. The respective signaling or display means can be triggered by way of the central machine control unit 28 for example.<br>
"1<br><br>
As can be seen in fig. 1, the frequency converters 22 to 26, which are associated with the drafting arrangement drives 14, 16 and the ring rail drive 18, are supplied by a common intermediate circuit 34 which can be charged with direct voltage via at least one frequency converter 20 associated with one or several spindle drives 12. This intermediate circuit 32 is also used to supply the machine control unit 28. which is connected to the intermediate circuit 34 by way of a DC/DC converter 36. The converter 36 is used to reduce the high direct voltage which is applied to the intermediate circuit 34 to a smaller value, which in this case is 24V for example.<br>
The frequency converter 20, which is provided for the spindle drive 12, is connected for mains voltage adjustment to a 3ph network via an optional filter 38 and a transformer or a choke 40.<br>
Fig. 2 shows the above mentioned operator control unit 42 which is connected with the central machine control unit 28.<br>
There is a data link 44 between the central machine control unit 28 and the frequency converters 20, 26 as well as setpoint value preparation means 46 (cf. fig. 2 in particular) which is associated in the present embodiment with the frequency converter 26. Moreover, there is an FC-internal data link 48 for the draft of the drafting arrangement and an FC-internal data link 50 for the synchronous run of the drafting arrangement (FC = the frequency converter unit comprising the frequency converter).<br>
Moreover, the present embodiment also comprises an electronic drafting arrangement gear. For this purpose the two drafting arrangement frequency converters 22, 24 cooperate in a respective manner. The respective control unit can be performed especially through a setpoint preparation board. A predetermination of data by the central machine control unit 28 to the setpoint preparation 46 or setpoint preparation board is possible in particular. The parameterization can be performed through the operator control unit 42 for example.<br><br>
The additional S-twist function is thus realized by an additional control input 30 of the frequency converter 20 for the reversed direction of rotation (REV). This reversed direction of rotation of the motor (REV) makes the electric spindle drive 12 rotate in the opposite direction by the frequency converter 20.<br>
The direction of rotation of the frequency converter is changed over by the control input 29 (FOR) to the control input 30 (REV) by way of the changeover contact 13 of relay 31 which is inserted into an enabling line 15 of frequency converter 20. The relay 31 is thus used as a changeover contact element. The central machine control unit 28 controls the relay 31 via a defined digital output 11.<br>
The operator control unit 42 can contain a menu item for example with a changeable variable for predetermining the rotational direction Z or S of the spindle.<br>
The direction of rotation forward (FOR) or reverse (REV) is then to be enabled in the respective parameter in the frequency converter 20. It is ensured that the correct direction of rotation is maintained in all machine sequences.<br>
Principally, a frequency converter each can be associated not only to the spinning machine drive 12 by also to any other spinning machine drives which are designed for triggering the drive in the one direction of rotation as well as for triggering the drive in the other direction of rotation and is provided with at least one respective control input. In such frequency converters, it is also possible, for example, that again two separate control inputs are provided which correspond to the two opposite directions of rotation and can be activated alternatingly through a relay for example. Irrespective of the respective embodiment, the direction of rotation can also be altered by changing at least one parameter of the respective frequency converter.<br>
The respective activated spinning machine drive can also concern a ring frame and doffer drive for example which, as is known, have to reverse.<br><br>
Principally, a drafting arrangement drive 14, 16 can be activated through a respectively designed frequency converter in the manner as explained in connection with the spindle drive 12.<br>
The central machine control unit 28 can comprise in this connection a drive reversal control which influences the frequency converter or the relay associated with the drafting arrangement drive in such a way that after the deactivation of the spinning machine the respective drafting arrangement drive reverses the drive-sided end of the drafting roller by a defined amount.<br>
The result is that the drafting roller twists or relieves during the standstill at the free end by a smaller angle than would be the case without the aforementioned measures. In accordance with fig. 4, the drafting roller 16a is subjected during its normal run to a twist up to a maximum amount v1 at its free shaft end, or in the middle of the machine in the case of a drive at either end. After the relief of the roller, the torsion angle goes back to the amount v2 if the drive-side (left) end of the drafting roller is held. Through a controlled reverse rotation or relief of the drafting roller at the drive side it is subjected to the relative twisting dv' at the left end as an active relief and, after a partial relief of the drafting arrangement, the passive relief dv" at the opposite end, with said values being smallerthan the difference of the absolute values v1-v2. Asa result of the reduced relative movements of the drafting roller during the relief after the deactivation, wrong drafts remain limited to a permissible extent.<br>
For the purpose of providing better understanding, the qualitative courses and values of the torsion of the drafting roller are outlined according to fig. 4 as follows:<br>
V	Torsion (angle of torsion) of the drafting roller in general over length L<br>
v1	Torsion in stationary run<br>
v2	Torsion after relief during standstill<br>
v3	Torsion under the influence of the relieving device<br>
dv'	Relief at the left roller end (drive side) with relieving device<br><br>
dv" dto,	Relief at the right free roller end in the middle of the machine with a drive<br>
at either side<br>
v1-v2	Relief on the right without relieving device<br>
The above statements apply analogously to any desired arrangements of the drive on the drafting roller.<br>
If an uninterrupted long drafting roller is driven at its two ends, the so-called "free end" is then located at approximately half the length of the roller in the middle of the machine. The "free end" shall be generally understood as being a specific position of a roller where no or an only irrelevant torque is transmitted.<br>
In general terms, the spinning machine is characterized in that for changing the respective direction of rotation of a drive an operator control unit 42 is connected with the central machine control unit 28 whereby the operator control circuit comprises a first module for effecting a forward motion of the drive and a second module for effecting a reverse motion of the same drive.<br><br>
