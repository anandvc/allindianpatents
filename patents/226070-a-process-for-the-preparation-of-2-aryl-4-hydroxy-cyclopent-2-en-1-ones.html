				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of 2-aryl-4-hydroxy-cyclopent-2-en-l-ones of the formula (1). More particularly it relates to a process for the preparation<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
of 2-aryl(substituted)-4-hydroxy-cyclopent-2-en-l-ones of the formula (1) from the corresponding aryl (substituted) furyl methanol having formula (2) wherein RI to R5 are each independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, azido, cyano, carboxymethyl, methoxy, methyl, thiomethyl, halo and nitro.<br>

The 2-aryl (substituted)-4-hydroxy-cyclopent-2-en-l-ones and their derivatives are useful intermediates in the synthetic organic chemistry and can be used for synthesis of biologically active compounds. Some of the 2,3-diaryl-4-substituted cyclopent-2-en-l-one derivatives have demonstrated remarkable cytotoxic activity against a variety of human cancer cell lines<br>
In the prior art the preparation of 2-aryl(substituted)-4-hydroxy-cyclopent-2-en-l-one of the formula (1) from the corresponding aryl(substituted) furyl methanol having formula (2) have been reported in two steps involving double rearrangement. The first rearrangement is effected by zinc chloride, formic acid, polyphosphoric acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid etc. followed by second rearrangement using alumina, chloral etc. Recently, a single step conversion was reported using water as solvent. It was observed<br><br>
that these conditions did not give the expected products in case of highly substituted aryl groups.<br>
