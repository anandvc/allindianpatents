				<td>AN IMPROVED HEAVY DUTY PLATEN MACHINE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to an improved heavy duty platen machine for the manufacture of an array of packaging materials such as boxes, cartons, containers and like materials. The invention, particularly relates to cutting and creasing machine driven by a pair of drive motors.<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART<br>
Cutting and creasing machines have been well known for many years in the cardboard making industry for cutting sheets of cardboard. Such machines comprising a substantially vertical fixed platen forming a support for a cutting form provided with knives and a movable platen operated by an oscillating movement for bringing into contact with the sheet, the sheets being successively brought into contact with its inner face.<br>
These machines come in different sizes and are used based on the size of the packaging box which is to be made. The technology that is emerging in the packaging sector, especially, the corrugated paper boxes and cartons, requires bigger platen and chase sizes. The bigger the size of packing boxes the bigger is the required size of the platen.<br>
A typical machine described in the US Patent No. 4,048,888 has a flywheel driven by a single drive motor and comprises a stationary platen mounted on the machine frame and an oscillating movable platen pivoted thereon to receive sheets one at a time from a magazine, means of delivering the sheets form the magazine to the moving platen and pivoting it, into contact with its stationary plates.<br>
These machines are basically simple and robust but consume large amount of power. In this type of platen machine, a single motor is provided to the flywheel which in turn connected to the main shaft. However the increase in the lateral dimension of platen machine results in a greater amount of power to be applied by the motor. Increasing the lateral dimension of the machine would also result in greater load and instability to the structure of the machine.<br>
The platen machine that is employed for cutting is available in different dimensions in order to comply with the requirements of differing box sizes. However the mere elongation of the length of the platen in the cutting machine is also plagued by many problems. The increase in the size of the cutting machine is accompanied by the increase<br>
in the power requirements to drive the flywheel of the main shaft optimally. This can be<br><br>
achieved by increasing the wattage of the drive motor. Increase in the wattage of the motor would evidently result in greater power consumption. Moreover the increase in the length of the cutting machine would result in the overall increase in mass of the machine creating issues relating to the stability of the machine when handling high loads. Also, single motor resulting non-uniform load distribution throughout the whole length and often leads to poor quality of finished product.<br>
Another common problem is that if the driving motor fails, then there is a time lag in the production line and the production can be resumed only after replacing the motor or after the relevant repairs. Such time lags result in loss when the production volume is very high.<br>
The present invention addresses all these drawbacks.<br>
Presently cutting and creasing machines exists that are of the cross-section up to 55X85 inches. In the present invention a machine with a cross-section of 55X110 inches is described with improvements that overcome the disadvantages related to larger cutting machines. The surprising results, in the form of better handling and stability of the machine are now achieved by coupling the second identical flywheel fixed at the other end of the main shaft with a second identical drive motor, wherein both motors are of a wattage less than what .was required in the case where the drive to the flywheel was provided by a single motor. This modification greatly improves the functioning of the heavy duty platen machine. The first drive motor may be used in conjunction with the second drive motor or individually depending on the load that has to be handled by the machine. Also if one of the motors fails the other can be used as an alternative thereby eliminating the need to stop the production temporarily. The motor can be replaced or can be repaired without stopping the production because the other motor can be used.<br>
In this invention, the term "'Hollow semi-cylindrical structure" is used for a structure which is hollow and is semi-cylindrical in shape. It is fixed onto the main frame to provide support.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
A main object of the invention is to provide an improved heavy duty platen machine for the manufacture of array of packaging materials.<br><br>
Another object of the invention is to provide an improved heavy duty platen machine of larger dimension for cutting, having two fly wheels driven by two motors for achieving enhanced operational control over the cutting machine.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide the option of changing the input power to the flywheel connected to the main shaft depending on the load.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a heavy duty platen machine capable of continuous operations in the event of failure of one motor.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an improved heavy duty platen machine in the drive mechanism comprising of two flywheels for the main shaft driven by two motors. The power consumed by two motors is less than the single motor employed in the prior art. An additional half round structure has been employed to give support to the main frame to increase the stability and the load bearing capability of the machine. The detailed description of the invention is further explained below.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENT INVENTION:<br>
The   invention  relates  to  an   improved   heavy  duty  platen   machine   for the<br>
manufacture of array of packaging materials and more additionally cutting of cardboard or<br>
other similar materials.<br>
The improved heavy duty platen machine for cutting and creasing one or more<br>
packaging material comprises of:<br>
a frame on which is fixed a stationary platen in a vertical disposition wherein<br>
means are provided for cutting and/or creasing operation,<br>
a movable platen, which is capable of oscillatory motion, fixed on to a shaft called<br>
movable platen shaft by means of bush and washer assembly, resting on a cam<br>
fixed on the frame; wherein the movable platen shaft is connected to a pair of gears<br>
by means of crank arms and gear pins wherein the movable platen is supported by<br>
hollow semi-cylindrical structures, wherein means are provided for embossing<br>
operation;<br><br>
a main shaft having a pair of gears and a pair of flywheels connected at both the<br>
ends supported by means of a rigid support base attached to the frame;<br>
a center shaft mounted onto the frame, conjoined with a center crank   through a<br>
plurality of the gears which are in turn geared to the pair of gears connected to<br>
main shaft, wherein the center shaft has a pair of gears at both the ends connected<br>
to said movable platen shaft; and<br>
a pair of drive motors placed at both the ends, coupled to the flywheels.<br>
The improved heavy duty machine according to the invention has means for cutting and/or creasing operations consisting of one or more sharp knives and blunt knives mounted onto a die which is fixed onto the fixed platen.<br>
The platen machine can also be used for embossing of the packaging material which is carried out by providing means for embossing in the form of an embossing die which is fixed onto the movable platen.<br>
The improved heavy duty platen machine according to the present invention has the cutting; creasing and embossing specification has to adhere to the specification of the die used<br>
The preferred embodiment of the invention has control mechanisms fixed to the main frame, by means of which either of the motors may be used or both the motors may be used in conjunction.<br>
The flywheels are coupled to the drive motors by belts, chain drives or other similar means.<br>
A safety braking mechanism is implemented by means of electro-magnetic clutch or magnetic clutch. The mechanism consists of a metallic plate fixed between two magnetic discs. The metallic plate may be brought into contact with either of the discs thereby isolating the machine from the drive mechanism.<br>
The packaging material is selected from a group consisting of corrugated boards, cardboards, metal sheets, hard plastic sheets and other similar packaging materials.<br>
These packaging materials are used in conjunction with poly vinyl chloride (PVC) sheet, hand made papers, duplex papers, either plane or printed or other similar materials.<br>
The invention is further described with reference to the drawings in the following paragraphs.<br>
The machine shown in FIG. 2 is of the type referred to above and comprises two supports and their support base 16 and 17 for the two flywheels 15. The base is furthermore provided with an additional hollow semi-cylindrical structure 23 displaced at<br><br>
nearly half the distance between the planes of rotation of the flywheel. The two flywheels 15 are keyed on the same horizontal main shaft 1 connected through suitable means e.g. a conveyer belt 11 to two separate driving motors 9.<br>
The machine as shown in the figure further comprises a fixed platen 20 arranged substantially vertical along with a movable platen 21. The raw material used in the manufacturing of the fixed platen body is C.I. casting. Fixed Platen consists of three bores for the shafts 1, 13 and 14. It is a stationary part of the machine or it is casting of the machine. The entire machinery comprises the parts as shown below with the numbers corresponding to the related components as depicted in Figure 1 and 2.<br>

The movable platen is fixed onto a movable platen shaft 22. The shaft 22 is connected to the main gear 2, the drive to which is transferred from the drive motor through a series of subsidiary gears 3, 4.and 5. The main gear 2 is also connected to the movable platen shaft by a crank shaft 25 attached to the main gear through means of gear pin 6 and fixed to the movable platen shaft through means of an "out bush".<br>
The continuous rotation of the gear 2 causes, through the two crank shafts 25 a back and forth movement of the movable platen 21 and then to repeat the above mentioned motion. The position of the movable platen is illustrated in Figure 3.<br>
Process of cutting and/or creasing and/or embossing an array of packaging materials for the manufacturing of boxes using said machine may be summarized as a series of simple steps.<br><br>
The paper which is to be cut is first subjected to a corrugation machine. Following the corrugation process two or more such corrugated sheets are glued or pasted. If required on both sides a plane sheet, which may be pre-printed, is glued and pasted. The product is called a corrugated board. Such corrugated boards are subsequently fed into a machine referred to as a Heavy Duty Platen or Die-Cutting Machine. The machine is then used for cutting and creasing the above mentioned corrugated board into specific shape and size. The cutting and the creasing has to adhere to the specification of a die which is fitted onto the body of the machine. The process of feeding the paper-board into the machine is undertaken manually.<br>
Plane papers, poly vinyl chloride (PVC) sheet, hand made papers, duplex papers, either plane or printed may be used, in addition to the corrugated boards, according to the requirement of the industry.<br>
As stated earlier the mere elongation of the length of the cutting machine is also plagued by many problems such as power requirements and issues related to stability. The invention in the instant case in essence relates to the general problem faced in the event of an increase in the dimension of the cutting machine mainly adequate drive to be imparted to the movable platen and the issue regarding the stability of the cutting machine when handling heavy loads. It also specifically relates to the problem of temporary halting of the machine due to the failure of one of the motors and addressing the same.<br>
As evident from the description, the presence of two motors assists in the even distribution of the load. Moreover, the functioning of the two motors when considered together is more efficient as compared to the single motor which is of wattage equal to the sum of the two individual motors. Depending on the load which is to be handled by the cutting machine, the operation may be varied by using one or two drive motors.<br>
Long cutting machines are often susceptible to instabilities arising out of heavy load handling of the machine. The instabilities may result in the damaging of the machines too. They may be minimized by providing an extra hollow semi-cylindrical structure as explained above. The presence of an extra hollow semi-cylindrical structure displaced midway across the length of the machine increases the stability of the machine while handling heavy loads.<br>
The platen machine is also provided with a stop bar for instant stopping of machine. A trip bar is also provided as a safety device on the moving platen. All the moving parts are covered with wrap around safety devices (trip guard on the fixed platen, cover guards for flywheel and belt.<br><br>
An electromagnetic/ magnetic clutch is provided to isolate the machine from the driving mechanism so as to implement a braking system.<br>
The machine is provided with a control panel for adjusting the parameters for optimum operation. Oiling is done at as many as 19 points in the machine simultaneously by pressing a single button on the panel.<br>
It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are intended to provide further explanation of the present invention, as claimed.<br>
