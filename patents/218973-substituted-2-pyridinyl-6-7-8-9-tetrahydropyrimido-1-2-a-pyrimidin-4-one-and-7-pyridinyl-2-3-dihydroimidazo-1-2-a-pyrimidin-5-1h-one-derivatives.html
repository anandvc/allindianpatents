SPECIFICATION<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to compounds that are useful as an active<br>
ingredient of a medicament for preventive and/or therapeutic treatment of<br>
neurodegenerative diseases caused by abnormal activities of GSK3p alone or<br>
by the combined effects of GSK3P and cdk5/p25.<br>
Background Art<br>
GSK3P (glycogen synthase kinase 3p) is a proline directed serine,<br>
threonine kinase that plays an important role in the control of metabolism,<br>
differentiation and survival. It was initially identified as an enzyme able to<br>
phosphorylate and hence inhibit glycogen synthase. It was later recognized that<br>
GSK3p was identical to tau protein kinase 1 (TPK1), an enzyme that<br>
phosphorylates tau protein in epitopes that are also found to be<br>
hyperphosphorylated in Alzheimer"s disease and in several tauopathies.<br>
Interestingly, protein kinase B (AKT) phosphorylation of GSK3p results in a loss<br>
of its kinase activity, and it has been hypothesized that this inhibition may<br>
mediate some of the effects of neurotrophic factors. Moreover, phosphorylation<br>
by GSK3P of p-catenin, a protein involved in cell survival, results in its<br>
degradation by an ubiquitinilation dependent proteasome pathway.<br>
Thus, it appears that inhibition of GSK3P activity may result in neurotrophic<br>
activity. Indeed there is evidence that lithium, an non-competitive inhibitor of<br>
GSK3ß, enhances neuritogenesis in some models and also increases neuronal<br>
survival, through the induction of survival factors such as Bcl-2 and the<br>
inhibition of the expression of proapoptotic factors such as P53 and Bax.<br>
Recent studies have demonstrated that p-amyloid increases the GSK3P activity<br>
and tau protein phosphorylation. Moreover, this hyperphosphorylation as well as<br>
the neurotoxic effects of p-amyloid are blocked by lithium chloride and by a<br>
GSK3P antisense mRNA. These observations strongly suggest that GSK3ß<br>
may be the link between the two major pathological processes in Alzheimer"s<br>
disease: abnormal APP (Amyloid Precursor Protein) processing and tau protein<br>
hyperphosphorylation.<br>
Although tau hyperphosphorylation results in a destabilization of the neuronal<br>
cytoskeleton, the pathological consequences of abnormal GSK3ß activity are,<br>
most likely, not only due to a pathological phosphorylation of tau protein<br>
because, as mentioned above, an excessive activity of this kinase may affect<br>
survival through the modulation of the expression of apoptotic and antiapoptotic<br>
factors. Moreover, it has been shown that p-amyloid-induced increase in GSK3ß<br>
activity results in the phosphorylation and, hence the inhibition of pyruvate<br>
dehydrogenase, a pivotal enzyme in energy production and acetylcholine<br>
synthesis.<br>
Cdk5/p25, also known as tau protein kinase 2 (TPK2), is a proline<br>
directed Ser/Thr kinase essential for central nervous system development and<br>
in particular for neuronal migration and neurite outgrowth. Cdk5 is a homologue<br>
of cyclin-dependent kinases and rather ubiquitously expressed. Its activator p35<br>
(a 305 aa protein) or a truncated form p25 (208 aa, missing an N-terminal<br>
proline-rich domain not required for activity) are selectively expressed in<br>
neurons, limiting cdk5 kinase activity essentially to the CNS. Cdk5 is completely<br>
inactive in the absence of p35 or p25. The term cdk5/p25 will be used here for<br>
the active enzyme since evidence exists suggesting that p25 and less so p35<br>
may be involved in pathological processes.<br>
Physiological substrates of cdk5/p25 include DARPP-32, Munc-18,<br>
PAK1, synapsin 1 and perhaps some others. In addition, it is now well<br>
established that cdk5/p25 phosphorylates tau protein epitopes which are<br>
hyperphosphorylated in Alzheimer"s disease. More recently, elevated cdk5/p25<br>
activity, mislocalization of cdk5 and an increase in p25 activator has been found<br>
in the brain of Alzheimer patients. Interestingly, prephosphorylation of tau<br>
protein by cdk5/p25 considerably enhances phosphorylation of tau by GSK3ß<br>
on other epitopes, also found hyperphosphorylated in Alzheimer"s disease.<br>
Moreover, neurofibrillary tangles, the hallmark of Alzheimer"s disease, are<br>
labeled with antisera for GSK3ß and cdk5, but not GSK3a and MAP kinase,<br>
also, GSK3ß and cdk5 are associated with microtubules and both, more than<br>
PKA and CK, contribute to the AD-like phosphorylation of tau protein. These<br>
results taken together suggest that mixed inhibitors of GSK3ß and cdk5/p25<br>
should efficient in protecting tau protein from hyperphosphorylation. Therefore,<br>
they would be useful in the treatment of any pathological disorder associated<br>
with the abnormal phosphorylation of tau protein, in particular Alzheimer"s<br>
disease, but also other tauopathies (e.g. frontotemporoparietal dementia,<br>
corticobasal degeneration, Pick"s disease, progressive supranuclear palsy).<br>
Cdk5/p25 has been linked to apoptosis and neurodegeneration in more<br>
general terms. Its overexpression induces apoptosis in cultured neurons, in<br>
brain tissue apoptotic cells show strong immunoreactivity for cdk5. Neurotoxic<br>
agents, incl. AP(1-42), neuronal injury, ischemia or growth factor withdrawal<br>
lead to activation and mislocalization of cdk5/p25, abnormal phosphorylation of<br>
cdk5 substrates, cytoskeletal disruption and cell death. Moreover,<br>
phosphorylation by cdk5/p25 transforms DARPP-32 into an inhibitor of protein<br>
kinase A, reducing signal transduction in the striatum with obvious implications<br>
for Parkinson"s disease. A role for cdk5 in ALS has also been proposed based<br>
on its ability to phosphorylate neurofilaments. More recently, deregulation of<br>
cdk5 was detected in a mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.<br>
Altogether, these experimental observations indicate that GSK3p inhibitors may<br>
find application in the treatment of the neuropathological consequences and the<br>
cognitive and attention deficits associated with Alzheimer"s disease, as well as<br>
other acute and chronic neurodegenerative diseasesyThese include, in a non-<br>
limiting manner, Parkinson"s disease, taupathies (e.g. frontotemporoparietal<br>
dementia, corticobasal degeneration, Pick"s disease, progressive Supranuclear<br>
palsy) aihd other dementia including vascular dementia; acute stroke and others<br>
traumatic injuries; cerebrovascular accidents (e.g. age related macular<br>
degeneration); brain and spinal cord trauma; peripheral neuropathies;<br>
retinopathies and glaucoma.<br>
In addition GSK3ß inhibition (nay find application in the treatment of other<br>
diseases such as:<br>
Non-insulin dependent diabetes (such as diabetes type II) and obesity; manic<br>
depressive illness; schizophrenia; alopecia; cancers such as breast cancer,<br>
non-small cell lung carcinoma, thyroid cancer, T or B-cell leukemia and several<br>
virus-induced tumors.<br>
Since it appears that both, GSK3ß and cdk5/p25 play a major role in the<br>
induction of apoptosis in neuronal cells, combined inhibition of these two<br>
enzymes may find application in the treatment of not only Alzheimer"s disease<br>
and the other above-mentioned tauopathies, but also in a number of other<br>
neurodegenerative disorders, in particular Parkinson"s disease and amyotrophic<br>
lateral sclerosis; other dementias including vascular dementia; acute stroke and<br>
other traumatic injuries; cerebrovascular accidents (e.g. age related macular<br>
degeneration); brain and spinal cord trauma; peripheral neuropathies;<br>
retinopathies and glaucoma.<br>
In addition mixed TPK1/TPK2 inhibitors may find their applications in the<br>
treatment of other diseases such as: smoking cessation and other withdrawal<br>
syndromes, epilepsy.<br>

not compromised by side effects ascribable to the anions. Although medicinally<br>
acceptable salts of the basic compounds are preferred, all acid-addition salts<br>
are within the scope of the present invention.<br>
In addition to the pyrimidone derivatives represented by the<br>
aforementioned formula (I) and salts thereof, their solvates and hydrates also<br>
fall within the scope of the present invention. The pyrimidone derivatives<br>
represented by the aforementioned formula (I) may have one or more<br>
asymmetric carbon atoms. As for the stereochemistry of such asymmetric<br>
carbon atoms, they may independently be in either (R) and (S) configuration,<br>
and the pyrimidone derivative may exist as stereoisomers such as optical<br>
isomers, or diastereoisomers. Any stereoisomers in pure form, any mixtures of<br>
stereoisomers, racemates and the like fall within the scope of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Examples of preferred compounds of the present invention are shown<br>
in table 1 and table 2 hereinafter. However, the scope of the present invention<br>
is not limited by these compounds.<br>

As a further object, the present invention concerns also methods for preparing<br>
the compounds represented by the aforementioned formula (I).<br>
These compounds can be prepared, for example, according to methods<br>
explained below.<br>
Preparation method<br>
Pyrimidone compounds represented by the aforementioned formula (I)<br>
may be prepared according to scheme 1.<br><br>
(In the above scheme the definition of R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, X, p, m and<br>
n are the same as those already described for compound of formula (I)).<br>
The pyrimidone derivative represented by the above formula (III),<br>
wherein R1 is as defined for compound of formula (I), is allowed to react with a<br>
base such as sodium hydride, sodium carbonate or potassium carbonate in a<br>
solvent such as N,N-dimethylformamide, N-methy!pyrrolidone, N,N-<br>
dimethylacetamide or chloroform at a suitable temperature ranging from 0 to<br>
130°C under ordinary air, then with a compound of formula (II), wherein R2, X,<br>
Y and n are as defined for compound of formula (I) and L represents a leaving<br>
group preferably bromide or mesyl group, is added to obtain the compound of<br>
the aforementioned formula (I).<br>
Compound of formula (II) are commercially available or may be<br>
synthesized according to well-known methods of one skilled in the art. The<br>
compound of formula (III) may be prepared according to the method defined in<br>
scheme 2.<br>
(In the above scheme the definition of R1, R3, R4, R5, p and m are the<br>
same as already described.)<br>
According to this method, the 3-ketoester of formula (IV) is allowed to<br>
react with a compound of formula ( V). The reaction may be carried out in the<br>
presence of potassium carbonate, in an alcoholic solvent such as methanol,<br>
ethanol and the like or without, at a suitable temperature ranging from 25°-<br>
140°C under ordinary air.<br>
Alternatively, compounds of formula (III) wherein R5 represents a<br>
hydrogen atom may be halogenated in order to give compounds of formula (III)<br>
wherein R5 is an halogen atom such as a bromine atom or a chlorine atom.<br>
The reaction may be carried out in an acidic medium such as acetic acid or<br>
propionic acid, in presence of bromosuccinimide or chlorosuccinimide, or<br>
bromine.<br>
In addition, compounds of formula (III) wherein R5 represents a fluorine atom<br>
may be obtained by analogy to the method described in Tetrahedron Letters,<br>
Vol.30,N°45,pp 6113-6116, 1989.<br>
Compounds of formula (V) or (IV) are commercially available or may be<br>
synthesized according to well-known methods of one skilled in the art.<br>
For example compounds of formula (IV), wherein R1 represent a pyridine ring<br>
optionally substituted by a C1-4 alkyl group, C1-4 alkoxy group or a halogen<br>
atom, can be prepared by reacting a nicotinic acid optionally substituted by a<br>
C1-4 alkyl group, C1-4 alkoxy group or an halogen, with a malonic acid<br>
monoester. The reaction can be carried out using methods well known to one<br>
skilled in the art, such as for example in presence of a coupling agent such as<br>
1,1"-carbonylbis-1H-imidazole in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran at a<br>
temperature ranging from 20 to 70°C.<br>
Compounds of formula (I) may also be obtained starting from another<br>
compound of formula (I) using well-known methods of one skilled in the art.<br>
In the above reactions, protection or deprotection of a functional group<br>
may sometimes be necessary. A suitable protecting group Pg can be chosen<br>
depending on the type of the functional group, and a method described in the<br>
literature may be applied. Examples of protecting group, of protection and<br>
deprotection methods are given for example in Protective groups in Organic<br>
Synthesis Greene et al., 2nd Ed. (John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York).<br>
The compounds of the present invention have inhibitory activity against<br>
GSK3p. Accordingly, the compounds of the present invention are useful as an<br>
active ingredient for the preparation of a medicament, which enables preventive<br>
and/or therapeutic treatment of a disease caused by abnormal GSK3p or<br>
GSK3J3 and cdk5/p25 activity and more particularly of neurodegenerative<br>
diseases such as Alzheimer"s disease. In addition, the compounds of the<br>
present invention are also useful as an active ingredient for the preparation of a<br>
medicament for preventive and/or therapeutic treatment of neurodegenerative<br>
diseases such as Parkinson"s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,<br>
tauopathies (e.g. frontotemporoparietal dementia, corticobasal degeneration,<br>
Pick"s disease, progressive supranuclear palsy) and other dementia including<br>
vascular dementia; acute stroke and others traumatic injuries; cerebrovascular<br>
accidents (e.g. age related macular degeneration); brain and spinal cord<br>
trauma; peripheral neuropathies; retinopathies and glaucoma; and other<br>
diseases such as non-insulin dependent diabetes (such as diabetes type II)<br>
and obesity; manic depressive illness; schizophrenia; alopecia; smoking<br>
cessation and other withdrawal syndromes, epilepsy; cancers such as breast<br>
cancer, non-small cell lung carcinoma, thyroid cancer, T or B-cell leukemia and<br>
several virus-induced tumors.<br>
The present invention further relates to a method for treating<br>
neurodegenerative diseases caused by abnormal activity of GSK3ß or<br>
GSK3pand cdk5/p25 and of the aforementioned diseases which comprises<br>
administering to a mammalian organism in need thereof an effective amount of<br>
a compound of the formula (I).<br>
As the active ingredient of the medicament of the present invention, a<br>
substance may be used which is selected from the group consisting of the<br>
compound represented by the aforementioned formula (I) and<br>
pharmacologically acceptable salts thereof, and solvates thereof and hydrates<br>
thereof. The substance, per se, may be administered as the medicament of the<br>
present invention, however, it is desirable to administer the medicament in a<br>
form of a pharmaceutical composition which comprises the aforementioned<br>
substance as an active ingredient and one or more pharmaceutical additives.<br>
As the active ingredient of the medicament of the present invention, two or more<br>
of the aforementioned substances may be used in combination. The above<br>
pharmaceutical composition may be supplemented with an active ingredient of<br>
another medicament for the treatment of the above mentioned diseases. The<br>
type of pharmaceutical composition is not particularly limited, and the<br>
composition may be provided as any formulation for oral or parenteral<br>
administration. For example, the pharmaceutical composition may be<br>
formulated, for example, in the form of pharmaceutical compositions for oral<br>
administration such as granules, fine granules, powders, hard capsules, soft<br>
capsules, syrups, emulsions, suspensions, solutions and the like, or in the form<br>
of pharmaceutical compositions for parenteral administrations such as injections<br>
for intravenous, intramuscular, or subcutaneous administration, drip infusions,<br>
transdermal preparations, transmucosal preparations, nasal drops, inhalants,<br>
suppositories and the like. Injections or drip infusions may be prepared as<br>
powdery preparations such as in the form of lyophilized preparations, and may<br>
be used by dissolving just before use in an appropriate aqueous medium such<br>
as physiological saline. Sustained-release preparations such as those coated<br>
with a polymer may be directly administered intracerebrally.<br>
Types of pharmaceutical additives used for the manufacture of the<br>
pharmaceutical composition, content ratios of the pharmaceutical additives<br>
relative to the active ingredient, and methods for preparing the pharmaceutical<br>
composition may be appropriately chosen by those skilled in the art. Inorganic<br>
or organic substances, or solid or liquid substances may be used as<br>
pharmaceutical additives. Generally, the pharmaceutical additives may be<br>
incorporated in a ratio ranging from 1% by weight to 90% by weight based on<br>
the weight of an active ingredient.<br>
Examples of excipients used for the preparation of solid pharmaceutical<br>
compositions include, for example, lactose, sucrose, starch, talc, cellulose,<br>
dextrin, kaolin, calcium carbonate and the like. For the preparation of liquid<br>
compositions for oral administration, a conventional inert diluent such as water<br>
or a vegetable oil may be used. The liquid composition may contain, in addition<br>
to the inert diluent, auxiliaries such as moistening agents, suspension aids,<br>
sweeteners, aromatics, colorants, and preservatives. The liquid composition<br>
may be filled in capsules made of an absorbable material such as gelatin.<br>
Examples of solvents or suspension mediums used for the preparation of<br>
compositions for parenteral administration, e.g. injections, suppositories, include<br>
water, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, benzyl alcohol, ethyl oleate,<br>
lecithin and the like. Examples of base materials used for suppositories include,<br>
for example, cacao butter, emulsified cacao butter, lauric lipid, witepsol.<br>
The dose and frequency of administration of the medicament of the<br>
present invention are not particularly limited, and they may be appropriately<br>
chosen depending on conditions such as a purpose of preventive and/or<br>
therapeutic treatment, a type of a disease, the body weight or age of a patient,<br>
severity of a disease and the like. Generally, a daily dose for oral administration<br>
to an adult may be 0.01 to 1,000 mg (the weight of an active ingredient), and<br>
the dose may be administered once a day or several times a day as divided<br>
portions, or once in several days. When the medicament is used as an<br>
injection, administrations may preferably be performed continuously or<br>
intermittently in a daily dose of 0.001 to 100 mg (the weight of an active<br>
ingredient) to an adult.<br>

In a first protocol: 7.5 uM of prephosphorylated GS1 peptide and 10 µM ATP<br>
(containing 300,000 cpm of 33P-ATP) were incubated in 25 mM Tris-HCI, pH<br>
7.5, 0.6 mM DTT, 6 mM MgCl2, 0.6 mM EGTA, 0.05 mg/ml BSA buffer for 1 hour<br>
at room temperature in the presence of GSK3ß (total reaction volume : 100<br>
microliters).<br>
In a second protocol: 4.1 µM of prephosphorylated GS1 peptide and 42 uM<br>
ATP (containing 260,000 cpm 33P-ATP) were incubated in 80 mM Mes-NaOH,<br>
pH 6.5, 1 mM Mg acetate, 0.5 mM EGTA, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.02%<br>
Tween 20,10% glycerol buffer for 2 hours at room temperature in the presence<br>
of GSK30.<br>
Inhibitors were solubilized in DMSO (final solvent concentration in the reaction<br>
medium, 1%).<br>
The reaction was stopped with 100 microliters of a solution made of 25 g<br>
polyphosphoric acid (85% P2O5), 126 ml 85% H3PO4, H2O to 500 ml and then<br>
diluted to 1:100 before use. An aliquot of the reaction mixture was then<br>
transferred to Whatman P81 cation exchange filters and rinsed with the solution<br>
described above. Incorporated 33P radioactivity was determined by liquid<br>
scintillation spectrometry.<br>
The phosphorylated GS-1 peptide had the following sequence :<br>
NH2-YRRAAVPPSPSLSRHSSPHQS(P)EDEE-COOH.<br>
The GSK3ß inhibitory activity of the compounds of the present invention are<br>
expressed in IC50, and as an illustration the range of IC50"s of the compounds in<br>
