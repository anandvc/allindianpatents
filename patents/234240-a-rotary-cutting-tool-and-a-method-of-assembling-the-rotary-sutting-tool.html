				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates in general to rotary metal cutting<br>
tools, and specifically to reamers having replaceable cutting heads.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A reamer of this type is disclosed in US Patent 4,040,765. In this<br>
design the reamer has an interchangeable cutter head with a conical butt which is<br>
inserted in a matching conical socket in the reamer shank. The cutter head is<br>
screwed to the reamer shank via a screw bolt. The conical engagement between<br>
the cutter head and the reamer shank ensures a connection free from play.<br>
However, this arrangement has the drawback that, particularly in the case of<br>
fairly strong feeding forces, the cutter head is pressed into the reamer shank and<br>
jams, especially because the conical engagement is also self-locking. The cutter<br>
head is hard to remove from the reamer shank, whereby the union pin in<br>
particular is subjected to great wear and tear. In this reamer there is no provision<br>
for equipping the cutter heads with coolant means. It is also not evident haw<br>
coolant means could be incorporated in this reamer, especially not coolant means<br>
having exits adjacent the cutting edges. Furthermore, since the conical butt has<br>
an internal thread the cutting head and conical butt cannot be made as a one piece<br>
integral member by form pressing and sintering a carbide powder.<br>
Another example of such a reamer disclosed in US Patent<br>
5,163,790 . The reamer has an interchangeable cutter head and a coolant-<br>
lubricant feed supplying the cutter head from an annular nozzle disposed far from<br>
the cutting blades. The cutter-head shank is cylindrical and is retained in an<br>
opening of the reamer shank and is secured threrto by means of a clamping bolt<br>
passing through the cutter head. The clamping bolt includes a recessed hexagon<br>
by means of which the clamping bolt can be screwed in and out. To replace the<br>
cutter head the clamping bolt has to be disadvantageously completely removed<br>
from the reamer shank. In this reamer there is no provision leading coolant to the<br>
cutter head. Moreover, when replacing a cutter head and tightening the clamping<br>
bolt to secure the cutter-head in position, there is no guarantee that the clamping<br>
bolt will end up in the same rotationally oriented position each time. Therefore,<br>
even if the coolant were to be somehow supplied to the head of the bolt and<br>
radially directed coolant apertures were provided in the head of the bolt, it would<br>
not be certain that the apertures would aligned with the cutter-head cutting edges<br>
every time a cutter head was secured in position. Furthermore, if instead of<br>
cutter blades secured to the cutter head, it was desired to form a one piece<br>
integral cutter head and shank from solid carbide, the elongated form of the<br>
cutter head together with the cutter-head shank makes it very difficult to form<br>
press and sinter.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a cutting tool and a<br>
replaceable cutting head therefor that significantly reduces or overcomes the<br>
aforementioned disadvantages.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Attention is first drawn to Figs. 1-3 showing a cutting tool in<br>
accordance with a first embodiment of the present invnetion illustrated by means<br>
of a reamer 10. The reamer 10 has a forward end 12, a rearward end 14 and a<br>
longitudinal axis of rotation A passing through the forward and rearward ends<br>
12,14 defining a forward to rearward direction. The reamer 10 comprises a<br>
cutting head 16, a screw member 18, and a tool shank 20. The cutting head 16 is<br>
a form pressed and sintered hard metal body made from a carbide powder such as<br>
Tungsten Carbide. The screw member 18 and the tool shank 20 are formed of<br>
machined steel or other hard materials. The tool shank 20 has an axially directed<br>
coolant channel 22 for providing coolant to the cutting head 16.<br>
The cutting head 16, shown in Figs. 4-6, has a forward end 24, a<br>
rearward end 26, an axis of rotational symmetry B, and an axially directed<br>
cutting head bore 27 having a bore surface 28. When securing the cutting head<br>
16 to the tool shank 20, the cutting head 16 is rotated clockwise around the axis<br>
B, when viewed in a top view. In the following, the terms "leading" and<br>
"trailing" will be used with respect to clockwise rotation of the cutting head 16.<br>
A bore radius Rl is defined between the axis of rotational symmetry B and the<br>
bore surface 28. The bore surface 28 has protruding from it, adjacent the<br>
rearward end 26 of the cutting head 16, three identical integrally formed radially<br>
inwardly projecting locking wings 30, each having a locking wing radial<br>
dimension R2 defined between an innermost surface 31 of the locking wings 30<br>
and the axis of rotational symmetry B, wherein the locking wing radial<br>
dimension R2 is less than the bore radius R1. The locking wings 30 are equally<br>
spaced on the bore surface 28 about the axis of rotational symmetry B. Adjacent<br>
locking wings 30 are separated by locking wing gaps 32. Each locking wing 30<br>
has a generally forwardly facing sloping locking surface 34. A stopper 36<br>
protrudes from a forward end 35' of each locking wing 30, protruding in the axial<br>
direction from the locking surface 34, on a trailing side thereof. The stopper 36<br>
has a generally radially extending, tangentially facing, first stop surface 38 on its<br>
trailing side and a generally radially extending, tangentially facing, second stop<br>
surface 40 on its leading side. The first and second stop surfaces 38, 40 are<br>
generally transverse to the locking surface 34 and preferably normal, or<br>
substantially normal, thereto. In a top view, the locking wing 30 has a first<br>
angular extent 42 defined by the locking surface 34. The stopper 36 has a second<br>
angular extents 44 that is smaller than the first angular extents 42. The first and<br>
second angular extent 42, 44 combine to form the total angular extent 45 of a<br>
single locking wing 30. The locking wing gap 32 has a third angular extent 46.<br>
A conical portion 48 projects at the rearward end 26 of the cutting<br>
head 16 from a generally cylindrical main body portion 49 of the cutting head 16.<br>
The conical portion 48 has an outer conical surface 50 coaxially aligned with the<br>
axis of rotational symmetry B and tapering rearwardly to a rearwardly facing<br>
annular contact surface 48'. The outer conical surface 50 merges with the cutting<br>
head 16 via a step 51 formed by the outer conical surface 50 and a rearwardly<br>
facing planar annular abutment surface 52 of the main body portion 49 of the<br>
cutting head 16.<br>
The cutting head 16 has a crown-like structure at its forward end 24<br>
having six identical equally spaced cutting edges 54 and recesses 56, each recess<br>
56 being substantially adjacent an associated cutting edge 54. A key (not shown)<br>
having protrusions that match the recesses 56, mates with the forward end 24 of<br>
the cutting head 16 in order to rotate the cutting head 16 during assembly, or<br>
disassembly of the reamer 10.<br>
Attention is now drawn to Figs. 7 and 8, showing the screw<br>
member 18. The screw member 18 has a forward end 58, a rearward end 60, a<br>
longitudinal axis C, and a generally tube-like body having a peripheral surface 62<br>
and an axially directed screw member bore 64 open at the rearward end 60. The<br>
peripheral surface 62 has a peripheral radial dimension R3 defined between the<br>
longitudinal axis C and the peripheral surface 62, wherein the peripheral radial<br>
dimension R3 is less than the locking wing radial dimension R2. The screw<br>
member 18 has three identical clamping wings 66 located towards its forward<br>
end 58. The clamping wings 66 protrude radially outwardly from the peripheral<br>
surface 62 at a maximum clamping wing radial dimension R4 with respect to the<br>
axis of rotational symmetry B, wherein the maximum clamping wing radial<br>
! dimension R4 is greater than the locking wing radial dimension R2, but less than<br>
the bore radius Rl. The clamping wings 66 are equally spaced apart about the<br>
longitudinal axis C, with adjacent clamping wings 66 separated by clamping<br>
wing gaps 68. Each clamping wing gap 68 is substantially equal in angular<br>
extent to the total angular extent 45 of each locking wing 30. Each clamping<br>
wing 66 has an angular extent with respect to the longitudinal axis C<br>
substantially less than the angular extent of each locking wing gap 32. Each<br>
clamping wing 66 has a sloping slightly convex, outwardly and rearwardly facing<br>
clamping surface 70 and first and second opposing generally radially extending<br>
side abutment surfaces 71'3 71".<br>
The screw member 18 is has an external screw thread 72 towards<br>
its rearward end 60 and four resilient members 74, extending from the external<br>
screw thread 72 to the rearward end 60. The resilient members 74 give the<br>
rearward end 60 a degree of flexibility in the radial direction. An abutment ring<br>
76 projects radially outwardly from the screw member 18 at a location between<br>
the clamping wings 66 and the external screw thread 72, preferably adjacent<br>
thereto. At the forward end of the screw member 18 are six radially directed<br>
coolant outlets 78 communicating between the screw member bore 64 and the<br>
peripheral surface 62.<br>
Attention is now drawn to Fig. 9, showing the forward end 80 of<br>
the tool shank 20, which is has a receiving bore 82, a planar forwardly facing<br>
annular support surface 84, a longitudinal axis D, and the coolant channel 22<br>
extending rearwardly from the receiving bore 82. The receiving bore 82 and the<br>
coolant channel 22 are coaxially aligned with the longitudinal axis D. The<br>
receiving bore 82 has a rearwardly tapering conical forward portion 86, and an<br>
internally threaded portion 88 extends from the conical forward portion 86 to a<br>
resisting portion 90. The resisting portion 90 has a diameter slightly smaller than<br>
the diameter of the rearward end 60 of the screw member 18.<br>
The assembly of the reamer 10 is performed by placing the<br>
rearward end 60 of the screw member 18 within the receiving bore 82 of the tool<br>
shank 20 and bringing the external screw thread 72 into initial threading<br>
engagment with the internally threaded portion 88. The cutting head 16 is placed<br>
upon the screw member 18 with the rearward end 26 of the cutting head 16 over<br>
the forward end 58 .of the screw member 18, until the annular contact surface 48'<br>
of the conical portion 48 of the cutting head 16 abuts the abutment ting 76. In<br>
this position, the cutting head 16 will be referred to as being in an open-position,<br>
as shown in Fig. 10. In the open-position, the clamping wings 66 lie in the<br>
locking wing gaps 32 of the cutting head 16 and the locking wings 30 lie in the<br>
clamping wing gaps 68 of the screw member 18.<br>
In order to secure the cutting head 16 to the tool shank 20, the<br>
cutting head 16 is now rotated in a clockwise direction about the axis of<br>
rotational symmetry B, when the cutting head 16 is viewed in the top view. The<br>
resilient members 72 engage the resisting portion 90 restraining the screw<br>
member 18 from freely rotating. The cutting head 16 is rotated from the open<br>
position, until each locking wing 30 slides underneath a corresponding clamping<br>
wing 66 with the locking and clamping surfaces 34, 70 in abutment, and each<br>
second stop surface 40 of the stoppers 36 abuts a corresponding clamping wing<br>
66 at the second side abutment surface 71" thereof. As the cutting head 16 is<br>
further rotated, the screw member 18 rotates with it due to the engagement of the<br>
second stop surface 40 and the second side abutment surface 71" of the clamping<br>
wing 66, thereby securing the screw member 18 in the threaded portion 88. With<br>
abutment between the clamping surface 70 and the locking surface 34 being<br>
maintained, the screw member 18 pulls the conical portion 48 of the cutting head<br>
16 into the conical forward portion 86 of the tool shank 20 until the annular<br>
abutment surface 52 of the cutting head 16 is brought into engagement with the<br>
 annular support surface 84 of the tool shank 20. With the conical portion 48 of<br><br>
the cutting head 16 located in the conical forward portion 86 of the tool shank 20,<br>
the cutting head 16 is centered with respect to the tool shank 20.<br>
It should be noted that the cutting head 16 does not have a threaded<br>
portion. Instead, the threading is located on the screw member 18, thereby<br>
effectively decoupling any adverse effects that the threading can have on the<br>
centering of the cutting head 16. As mentioned above, the clamping surface 70<br>
of each clamping wing 66 is slightly convex, thereby ensuring that the screw<br>
member 18 "floats" as the cutting head 16 is rotated clockwise in order to<br>
securely clamp the cutting head 16 in position. Surface contact by the clamping<br>
wings 66 and the locking wings 30 is designed not to affect the centering of the<br>
cutting head 16 formed by location of the conical portion 48 of the cutting head<br>
16 in the conical forward portion 86 of the tool shank 20. The coolant outlets 78<br>
are spatially distributed with respect to the clamping wings 66 in such a manner<br>
mat when the reamer 10 is assembled, the recesses 56 are aligned with the<br>
coolant outlets 78, thus ensuring that the coolant is supplied directly to each of<br>
the cutting edges 54. The alignment of the coolant outlets 78 with the recesses<br>
56 is made possible due to the fact that the second stop surface 40 of each<br>
stopper 36 abuts a corresponding second side abutment surface 71" of each<br>
clamping wing 66.<br>
To unclamp the cutting head 16 and remove it from the tool shank<br>
20, the cutting head 16 is rotated in an anticlockwise direction. Initially, the<br>
cutting head 16 will rotate until the first stop surfaces 38 abut the first side<br>
abutment surfaces 71' of the clamping wings 66, thereby unscrewing the screw<br>
member 18. As the screw member 18 exits the receiving bore 82, the abutment<br>
ring 76 pushes up on the conical portion 48 of the cutting head 16 forcing it out<br>
of the conical forward portion 86 of the receiving bore 82. At this stage, the<br>
cutting head 16 can be lifted off of the screw member 18 and a new cutting head<br>
16 can be placed in position on the screw member 18. Hence, in normal<br>
operation, the, screw member 18 does not have to be removed; it is simply<br>
screwed in and out of the receiving bore 82 by a few turns every time a cutting<br>
head 16 is replaced. If it is required to remove the screw member 18, that is, to<br>
disassemble the reamer 10, then one simply continues to rotate the cutting head<br>
16 in an anticlockwise direction until the screw member 18 is completely<br>
unscrewed.<br>
As described above, in accordance with the first embodiment of the<br>
present invention," rotational coupling between the cutting head and the screw<br>
member is obtained by the engagement of the clamping wings 66 of the screw<br>
member 18 and the stoppers 36 which protrude forwardly in the axial direction<br>
from the locking surfaces 34 of the locking wings 30. When the cutting head 16<br>
is attached to the tool shank 20, each locking wing 30 is located underneath a<br>
corresponding clamping wing 66 with the locking and clamping surfaces 34, 70<br>
in abutment.<br>
Attention is now drawn to Figs. 11 to 14 showing a cutting head<br>
116, a screw member 118 and the tool shank 20 of a reamer 110 in accordance<br>
with a second embodiment of the present invention. The reamer 110 according<br>
to the second embodiment is not shown, but is identical in appearance to the<br>
reamer 10 in accordance with the first embodiment, as shown in Fig. 1. The tool<br>
shank 20 of the reamer 110 according to the second embodiment is identical to<br>
the tool shank 20 of the first embodiment. The assembly and disassembly of the<br>
reamer 110 in accordance with the second embodiment and the securing of the<br>
cutting head 116 to, and removal from, the tool shank 20, is procedurally the<br>
same as in the first embodiment. Therefore, the description of the reamer 110 in<br>
accordance with the second embodiment will focus principally on the differing<br>
features between the two embodiments.<br>
The cutting head 116 has a forward end 124, a rearward end 126,<br>
an axis of rotational symmetry B1, and an axially directed cutting head bore 127<br>
having a bore surface 128. The bore surface 128 has protruding from it, adjacent<br>
the rearward end 126 of the cutting head 116, three identical integrally formed<br>
radially inwardly projecting locking wings 130. The locking wings 130 are<br>
equally spaced about the axis of rotational symmetry Bl on the bore surface 128<br>
and have locking wing gaps 132 between adjacent locking wings 130. Each<br>
locking wing 130 has a generally forwardly facing sloping locking surface 134<br>
and a stopper 136 located at the rear end 135" of the locking wing 130. The<br>
stopper 136 protrudes in the axial direction from the rear end 135", on a trailing<br>
side thereof. The stopper 136 has a radially extending, generally tangentially<br>
facing, first stop surface 138 on its trailing side and a radially extending,<br>
. generally tangentially facing, second stop surface 140 on its leading side.<br>
A conical portion 148 projects at the rearward end 126 of the<br>
cutting head 116 from a generally cylindrical main body portion 149 of the<br>
cutting head 116. The conical portion 148 has an outer conical surface 150<br>
coaxially aligned with the axis of rotational symmetry Bl that tapers rearwardly<br>
to a rearwardly facing annular contact surface 148'. The outer conical surface<br>
150 merges with the cutting head 116 at a step 151 formed by the outer conical<br>
surface 150 and a rearwardly facing planar annular abutment surface 152 of the<br>
cylindrical main body portion 149 of the cutting head 116. The external<br>
appearance of the cutting head 116 in accordance with the second embodiment is<br>
identical to that of the first embodiment. The cutting head 116 having a crown-<br>
like structure at its forward end 124 having six identical equally spaced cutting<br>
edges 154 (not seen in Figs. 12 and 13) and recesses 156, each recess 156 being<br>
substantially adjacent an associated cutting edge 154.<br>
The screw member 118 has a forward end 158, a rearward end 160,<br>
a longitudinal axis C1, and a generally tube-like body having a peripheral surface<br>
162 and an axially directed screw member bore 164 open at its rearward end 160.<br>
The screw member 118 has three identical clamping wings 166 located towards<br>
its forward end 158. The clamping wings 166 protrude radially outwardly from<br>
the peripheral surface 162 and are equally spaced apart about the longitudinal<br>
axis Cl, having clamping wing gaps 168 between them. Each clamping wing<br>
166 has a sloping, preferably slightly convex, outwardly and rearwardly facing<br>
clamping surface 170 and first and second generally radially extending side<br>
surfaces 171', 171".<br>
The screw member 118 has an external screw thread 172 located<br>
towards its rearward end 160 and four resilient members 174, extending from the<br>
external screw thread 172 to the rearward end 160 thereby providing the<br>
rearward end 160 a degree of flexibility in the radial direction. Radial abutment<br>
members 175, protruding radially outwardly from the peripheral surface 162, are<br>
located between the external screw thread 172 and the clamping wings 166<br>
adjacent the external screw thread 172. The radial abutment members 175 are<br>
spaced equally around the peripheral surface 162 with an axial abutment member<br>
176 located between each radial abutment member 175. Each radial abutment<br>
member 175 has first and second side abutment surfaces 175', 175". Each axial<br>
abutment member 176 has an axially and forwardly facing axial abutment surface<br>
176'. The screw member 118 has six radially directed coolant outlets 178<br>
adjacent the forward end 158, communicating between the screw member bore<br>
164 and the peripheral surface 162. As with the first embodiment, in the second<br>
embodiment the coolant outlets 178 are spatially distributed with respect to the<br>
clamping wings 166 in such a manner that when the reamer 110 is assembled, the<br>
recesses 156 are aligned with the coolant outlets 178, thus ensuring that the<br>
coolant is supplied directly to each of the cutting edges 154.<br>
The reamer 110, in accordance with the second embodiment of the<br>
present invention, is assembled much in the same way as the reamer 10 in<br>
accordance with the first embodiment. The rearward end 160 of the screw<br>
member 118 is placed in coaxial alignment within the receiving bore 82 of the<br>
tool shank 20, so that the external screw thread 172 is in initial threading<br>
engagement with the internally threaded portion 88 of the tool shank 20. The<br>
cutting head 116 is placed upon the screw member 118 with the rearward end<br>
126 of the cutting head 16 over the forward end 158 of the screw member 118,<br>
and the rearwardly facing annular contact surface 148' of the conical portion 148<br>
is in abutment with the forwardly facing axial abutment surfaces 176' of the axial<br>
abutment members 176. In this position, referred to the "open-position", the<br>
clamping wings 166 lie in the locking wing gaps 132 of the cutting head 116 and<br>
the locking wings 130 lie in the clamping whig gaps 168 of the screw member<br>
118.<br>
In order to secure the cutting head 116 to the tool shank 20, the<br>
cutting head 116 is now rotated in a clockwise direction about the axis of<br>
rotational symmetry B, when the cutting head 116 is viewed in a top view. The<br>
cutting head 116 is rotated from the open position, until each locking wing 130<br>
slides underneath an opposing clamping wing 166 so that the locking wings 130<br>
and clamping wings 166 form opposing wing pairs. In each wing pair, the<br>
clamping surface 170 of the clamping wing 166 is in abutment with the locking<br>
surface 134 of the locking wing 130. In this position, the stoppers 136 and the<br>
radial abutment members 175 form radial abutment pairs. In each radial<br>
abutment pair, the second stop surface 140 of the stopper 136 is in abutment with<br>
the second side abutment surface 175" of the radial abutment member 175. The<br>
cutting head 116 is rotated until the screw member 118 is completely screwed<br>
into in the threaded portion 88 and the conical portion 148 of the cutting head<br>
116 is located in a conical forward portion 86 of the tool shank 20 with the<br>
annular abutment surface 152 of the cutting head 116 in engagement with an<br>
annular support surface 84 at a forward end of the tool shank 20.<br>
To unclamp the cutting head 116 and remove it from the tool shank<br>
20, the cutting head 116 is rotated in an anticlockwise direction. Initially, the<br>
cutting head 116 will rotate until the first stop surfaces 138 abut the first side<br>
abutment surfaces 175' of the radial abutment members 175, thereby unscrewing<br>
the screw member 118. As the screw member 118 exits the receiving bore 82,<br>
the forwardly facing axial abutment surfaces 176' of the axial abutment members<br>
176 push up on the annular contact surface 148' of the conical portion 148 of the<br>
cutting head 116 forcing it out of the receiving bore 82.<br>
Although the present invention has been described to a certain<br>
degree of particularity, it should be understood that various alterations and<br>
modifications could be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the<br>
invention as hereinafter claimed.<br><br>
