The device and method are able to compensate for diaphragm deformation (offset) and varying dielectric constants present n a process field environment. The pressure sensor (56), filled with a dielectric fill-fluid (95), comprises at least three capacitor plates (144, 146, 148, 150), disposed about a diaphragm (102).

PROCESS PRESSURE MEASUREMENT DEVICES WITH IMPROVED ERROR COMPENSATION<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Generally defined, the term "process variable" refers to a physical or chemical state of matter or conversion of energy. Examples of process variables include pressure, temperature; flow, conductivity, pH, and other properties, The term "process measurement" refers to the acquisition of information that establishes the magnitude of process quantities. Pressure is considered a basic process variable in that it is used for the measurement of flow (the difference of two pressures), level (head or back pressure), and even temperature (fluid pressure in a thermal system).<br>
An industrial process transmitter is a transducer that responds to a measured variable with a sensing element and converts the variable to a standardised transmission signal, e.g., an electrical or optical signal or air pressure, that is a function of the measured variable. Industrial process pressure transmitters are used with the pressure measurement of an industrial process such as slurries, liquids, vapors and gasses in chemical, pulp, petroleum, gas, pharmaceutical, food, and other fluid processing plants. Industrial process transmitters are often placed near the process fluids, or in field applications. Often, these field applications  are  subject  to  harsh  and  varying<br><br>
environmental conditions that provide challenges for designers of such transmitters.<br>
The sensing element in many pressure transmitters is a capacitance sensor that includes a deflectable sensing diaphragm ("diaphragm") and two capacitor electrodes. A first type of sensing element includes a diaphragm, which is a conductive stretched membrane that deflects in response to pressures applied on both sides of the diaphragm, and two capacitor electrodes, one on each side of the diaphragm, A dielectric fill-fluid is used between the capacitor plates and the diaphragm. The fill fluid, used with an isolating diaphragm interfacing with the process fluid, prevents the process fluid, which at times can be harsh, corrosive, dirty or contaminated, from interacting with the components of the sensing element and perhaps damaging the components. A first capacitor electrode, on one side of the diaphragm, coupled with the conductive diaphragm forms a first capacitor. A second capacitor electrode, on the opposite side of the diaphragm, coupled with the diaphragm forms a second capacitor. The capacitance of each capacitor changes in proportion to the inverse of the distance between the capacitor plate and the diaphragm. Thus, the capacitance of each capacitor changes as the diaphragm deflects in response to the applied pressures. The amount of deflection is related to the difference between the two applied pressures, or differencial pressure. The differential capacitance between  each  capacitor  plate  and  the  conductive<br><br>
diaphragm is detected and is used to provide the standardized transmission signal, which is related to differential pressure.<br>
The sensina element is Darticularlv adaoced to<br>
—
detect diaphragm deflection in a process field environment. The approximate relationship between the capacitance, C, and the distance between one of<br>
the capacitor plates, X, is C = eK/X, where e is the permittivity of the fill-fluid and K is a constant depending on several factors such as the geometry of the sensing element. The permittivity e of a typical fill-fluid is sensitive to changes in a process field environment. The permittivity £ typically varies by approximately 15% over typical temperature ranges of a fill fluid in process field environments. The sensing element with two opposing capacitors is configured such that the output is generally independent of a varying permittivity. The two capacitors in the sensing element generally provide an output related to the ratio (Ci - C2) / (Ci + C2) , where C: is representative of the capacitance of the first capacitor and C2 is representative of the capacitance of the second capacitor in the sensing<br>
element. The permittivity £ in the numerator cancels the permittivity in the denominator of this ratio. Accordingly, the sensing element is generally insensitive to temperature changes of a fill fluid in a process field environment.<br>
A second type cf capacitive sensing element is known, but unlike the first type of sensing element<br><br>
described above, the second type of sensing element is not suited for measuring differential pressure. Instead, the second type of sensing element is used to measure absolute pressure. The second type of sensing element has two capacitor plates, forming two capacitors, on one side of the diaphragm, rather than on opposite sides of the diaphragm. The second type of sensor does not use a fill-fluid. Absolute process pressure is applied to the sensor diaphragm on the side opposite the electrodes. The second type of sensor includes a ceramic substrate to position two capacitor electrodes the same distance from the undeflected conductive diaphragm. The two capacitor electrodes are positioned in a plane on one side of the diaphragm in order to compensate for undesired motion of the ceramic substrate. The sensor output is related to the difference of the capacitances. The sensor detects curvature of the parabolically deflected diaphragm, and the sensor output cancels or disregards piston-like movement of the ceramic substrate that typically occurs as a result of temperature changes. The second type sensor is not suited for use with a fill fluid on the electrode side of the diaphragm because the transfer function that compensates for piston-like motion of the substrate is unable to compensate for changes in the permittivity of that fill fluid as the temperature changes,<br>
The ability to detect the curvature of the deflected diaphragm in a field process environment has advantages over merely the ability to detect the<br><br>
amount cf deflection of the diaphragm. Ideally, the displacement of the diaphragm is proportional to the differences in the pressures applied to both sides of the diaphragm. Unfortunately, the diaphragm does not deflect in an ideal manner. Due to Dhvsical forces inherent in stretched membranes. diat)hracms are often deformed after they have been deflected. This deformation can be described as an "offset," where the very edges of the diaphragm are bent in such a way so that the flat portion of the diaphragm is spaced closer to one of the electrodes than the it is in an ideal spacing, i.e. , the edges are bent so as the flat central portion protrudes toward one or the other of the electrodes, The offset is not detected by merely sensing the diaphragm deflection in the sensing element of the first type, and this offset causes inaccurate readings of the process pressure. These inaccurate readings have gone uncompensated for at least two reasons. First, there was a lack of appreciation of the source of these errors and the resulting diaphragm offset. Second, the sensing elements and transmitters currently available are unable to separate curvature from offset in a measurement of deflection; and still compensate for varying permittivity due to changing temperatures in a process field environment.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention is directed to a new device and method that provide for improved error compensation in the measurement of orocess oressure.   The new<br><br>
device and method are able to compensate for diaphragm offset and varying permittivity present in a process field environment. Early tests have demonstrated that the new device and method significantly improve the accuracy of process pressure measurement and can reduce some offset errors by at least an order of magnitude.<br>
One aspect the invention is directed to an improved sensing element, or pressure sensor. The pressure sensor, filled with a dielectric fill-fluid, includes at least three capacitor electrodes, disposed about a diaphragm. At least two capacitor electrodes are placed on one side of a conductive diaphragm, and are arranged in a particular manner with respect to the diaphragm. At least one capacitor electrode is placed on the other side of the diaphragm. For example, the sensor includes a cell body having an interior cavity filled with the dielectric fill-fluid. The deflectable diaphragm with a conductive portion is stretched across the interior cavity and separates the interior cavity into two smaller cavities. At least two electrodes are coupled to the cavitv wall within the first of the two smaller cavities. One of the electrodes is closer to the center of the cavitv wall than is the<br>
-4.<br>
other electrode, i.e., one of the electrodes is in a "center region" and the other electrode is in an "edge region."  Within the second of the two smaller<br>
cavities, at least one electrode is couoled to the cavity wall. In one embodiment of this aspect, each of the two smaller cavities includes two electrodes<br><br>
coupled  to  the  respective  cavity  walls.    This embodiment makes use of four capacitive electrodes.<br>
Another aspect of the invention is directed tc an improved process pressure transmitter. The process pressure transmitter includes the pressure sensor electrically coupled to an analog to digital converter such that the electrodes of the pressure sensor provide an input to the analog to digital converter. One type of analog to digital converter is a caoacitance to diaital converter. In one embodiment, the electrodes are coupled together either directly or through circuit elements and then provided to the analog to digital converter. This embodiment permits coupling the sensor to existing analog to digital circuits. Other embodiments contemplate the use of specially-designed analog to digital circuits. The transmitter is suitable for use in a process field environment.<br>
Still another aspect ' of the invention is directed to an improved method of measuring diaphragm deflection in process pressure sensors. Specifically, the improved method measures curvature of the diaphragm as separate from offset and compensates for variances in the permittivity of the fill-fluid. An error compensated measurement of differential pressure is a function of the amount of diaphragm deflection detected at the edge region subtracted from the amount of diaohracm deflection detected at the center region. One method measures the changes in capacitances from two capacitor electrodes  on  each  side  of . the  diaphragm,  and<br><br>
combines these values to achieve an error compensated<br>
output representative of the applied differential pressure. The method can be performed with a basic transfer function. This basic transfer function can be implemented in variety of ways, and each way includes a more specific transfer function. The transfer functions can be implemented through hardware or software.<br>
The present invention significantly reduces errors due to diaphragm offset, or "offset errors." One type of offset error is called "pressure hysteresis error." For example, as the process pressure moves up-scale from a lower value to a higher value, the sensor will provide an output at points along the path. However, as the process pressure then move down-scale from the higher value toward the lower value, the output may differ at the same points. The separation between the up-scale output and the down-scale output at a point is the pressure hysteresis error. The ideal output, i.e., an output that precisely corresponds with the input, is often somewhere between the up-scale output and the down-scale output, and the actual output is often not an accurate representation of the process pressure. Prior art sensors may generate an output that includes pressure hysteresis errors of about 0.11%, whereas the present invention provides an output with pressure hysteresis errors of less than about G. 01%. The present invention also significantly reduces offset errors known in the art such as overpressure  zero return hysteresis,  zero<br><br>
line  pressure  error,  zero  temperature  hysteresis error, and improves long term zero drift.<br>

DESCRIPTION<br>
In the following description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings. The drawings and description provide specific examples, or "embodiments," of how the invention may be made or used, or "practiced." The scope of the invention includes the specific examples, and other examples, and should not be limited to the examples of the sensors, transmitters, or methods described here, or any specific feature of the sensors, transmitters, or methods. Methods of error compensation in measuring process pressure are presented with reference to the sensor and transmitter. But these methods are independent of the sensors and transmitters, and can be used with other sensors and transmitters, or with sensors and transmitters not yet known. Other examples are contemplated and will fall within the scope of the invention even if they were developed after the disclosed examples. Changes can be made to the described embodiments without departing from the spirit and scope of the protected invention, which is defined by the appended claims.<br>
Ficr.i shows aenerallv the environment of a process measurement system 32. Fig. 1 shows process piping 3 0 containing a fluid under pressure coupled to the process measurement system 32 for measuring a process pressure. The process measurement system 32 includes impulse piping 34 connected to the piping<br><br>
30. The impulse piping 34 is connected to a process pressure transmitter 36. A primary element 33, such as an crifice plate, venturi tube, flow nozzle, and so on, contacts the process fluid at a location in the process piping 3 0 between the pipes of the impulse piping 34. The primary element 33 causes a pressure change in the fluid as it passes past the primary element 33.<br>
Transmitter 3 6 is a process measurement device that receives process pressures through the impulse piping 34. The transmitter 3 6 senses the process pressures and converts it to a standardized transmission signal that is a function of the process pressure. Transmitters can also sense multiple process variables or can be configured to provide process control functions. In the example, transmitter 36 is a differential pressure transmitter. Differential pressure is the difference in magnitude between two pressure values, e.g., the difference between two process pressures input to a transmitter. The measurement of differential pressure includes the measurement of gage pressure where the reference pressure input to the transmitter is atmospheric pressure, and also includes the measurement of absolute pressure where the reference pressure input to the transmitter is a vacuum. Fig, 1 'shows the transmitter configured to measure flow. Other uses of the transmitter for differential pressure measurement, however, are contemplated,<br>
A process  loop  3 8  facilitates  both  a  power signal  co  the  transmitters  3 5  and  bidirectional<br><br>
communication, and can be constructed in accordance with a number of process communication protocols. In the illustrated example, the process loc-p 3 8 is a two-wire loop. A two-wire loop, as the name implies, uses only two wires to electrically connec: the transmitter 3 6 to a remote control room 40. The two-wire loop is used to transmit all power to and all communications to and from the transmitter 3 6 during normal operations with a 4-20 mA signal. Accordingly, the transmitter 3 6 as illustrated often is referred to as a "two-wire transmitter," although other configurations, such as three-wire and f our-wire transmitters, and so on, are known and contemplated. Communication can be performed with a 4-20 mA analog signal, and the open protocol HART® (Highway Addressable Remote Transducer) digital communications format that provides simultaneous digital communications with the 4-20 mA signal. Communication can also be performed with open and<br>
interoperable protocol FOUNDATION™ Fieldbus that provides a digital communication link among intelligent field level and control devices. The transmitter 36 can be configured for use with other process protocols, including Device Bus, Sensor Bus, Prof ibus, the ethemet, and others in use throughout the world. A computer 42 or other information handling system through modem 44, or other network interface, is used for communication with the transmitter 36. A remote voltage power supply 46 Dowers tne transmitter 3 6,<br><br>
Fig. 2 shows an exploded view of the transmitter 36- Flange 50 is attached to a sensor module 52 to interface with impulse piping 34. The sensor module 5 2 includes a threaded housing 53 that is an all welded design to isolate internal components from the process medium and the field environment. Fig, 3 shows a block diagram of transmitter 3 6 corresponding with Fig, 2. A process pressure 54 is applied to the sensor module 52. A pressure sensor 56, isolated mechanically, electrically, and thermally from the process medium receives the process pressures 54 and provides an analog electrical signal 5 8 representative of differential pressures. The signal 58 is processed and converted to a digital signal at sensor module electronics 6 0 that includes an analog to digital converter 62 and a sensor module memory 64. Memory 64 contains specific information about the sensor module and correction coefficients for the sensor module 52. A temperature sensor 63 provides an analog signal representative of ambient temperature to the sensor electronics 60. The digital signal is output over a multi-pin cable 66. As indicated in Fig. 2, the multi-pin cable 66 is implemented as a retractable tape enclosed by a cover 63 on the cap 70 of the sensor module 52.<br>
An electronics housing 71 carries transmitter components that interface with the sensor module 5 2 and loop 38. The multi-pin cable 66 plugs into an electronics board 72. Fig, 3 shows that the electronics board includes a microprocessor system 74 and memory 7 5 that are used to further condition the<br><br>
digital signal. A digital to analog converter 78 cr digital communication circuitry 8 0 is used to generate and receive either an analog or digital transmission sicnal over the looo 38, and is therefore often referred to as a "communication circuit." The loop 3 3 is connected to the transmitter through openings 82, as shown in Fig. 2. A terminal block 84 is electrically connected to the electronics board 72 to provide direct access to the generated signals. The electronics housing 71 receives the sensor module 52 and caps 86 with o-rings 8 8 to provide an explosion proof housing in an assembled transmitter 3 6 suitable for field installation. The housing protects the transmitter electronics that are within the sensor module 52 and the electronics housing 71.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a sectioned view of the sensor module 52. Differential process pressures 54, typically in the form of a fluid (gas or liquid) is applied to the sensor module 52 at isolation diaphragms 90. Each isolation diaphragm 90 deflects in response to the applied process pressures 54 within its isolation chamber 92. The isolation chambers 92 are in communication with isolation tubes 94 filled with a fill-fluid 95 that transfer the applied process pressures 54 to a sensor 5S, which is also indicated schematically in Fig. 3 at reference number 56, The isolation diaphragms 90 serve to protect the sensor 5 6 from the process fluid, which can be corrosive or ■ otherwise detrimental to the sensor 5£.   The sensor 55 includes a cell body SS<br><br>
with an interior cavity 100 filled with- the fill-fluid 95. A diaphragm 102, often referred to as a sensing diaphragm, separates the interior cavity 10 0 into two generally equal and opposite cavity halves, and deflects in response to the process pressure 54 as transferred into the interior cavity 100. The displacement of the deflected diaphragm 102 is proportional to the difference in pressure between the two halves of the cavity 100, The position of the diaphragm 102 with respect to the cavity 10 0 is detected with capacitor electrodes (describe in detail below) within the cavity 100. Lead wires 104, 106, 103, 110 extend through openings 111 and 113 and connect capacitor electrodes to a sensor electronics board 112, containing sensor electronics 60. Thus, the sensor 56 converts the differential process pressure into an analog electrical signal, and the sensor electronics 60 convert the analog electrical signal into a digital electrical signal.<br>
Fig. 5 shows a detailed side view of the sensor 56 as sectioned in Fig. 4, and Fig. 6 shows a partially exploded perspective view of the sensor 56. The cell body 98 can be made from any suitable materials used to manufacture capacitance type pressure sensors. In the example shown, the cell body S8 includes a metal housing 114 that is formed of two cup-like halves 116, 118 prior to assembly. The cup-like halves 116, 118 are each filled with a rigid insulator 120 such as ceramic or glass that is fused to the metal housing 114. The insulator 12 0 includes openings 122 in communication with isolation<br><br>
tubes 94. Each opening 122 is in communication with openings 124 in ceramic tubes 125, where the openings 124 extend through the insulator 12 0 and into the interior cavity 100 . Each of the halves 116, 118 is machined so as to form a concave surface in at least the insulator 12 0 and tube 125. A portion cf the cell body 93 is also machined to be concave in the example shown. This concave surface is referred to as a first interior wall 126 in the first half 116 and a second interior wall 123 in the second half 118, The concave interior walls 126, 128 in the example shown are, at least in part, generally spherical. The concave interior walls 126, 123 are opposite from each other and form and define the interior cavity 10 0 in an assembled sensor 96. As one alternative to a concave surface, the cell body can include a rectangular recess that creates two generally opposite interior walls.<br>
The diaphragm 102 is placed between the two halves 116, 118, stretched taut, and welded into place with a continuous weld bead 130. The bead weld 13 0 joins together and hermetically seals the halves 116, 118 to form the cell body 93. The weld 130 also holds the diaphragm 102 under a desired amount of tension so it can act as a deflectable spring element that, when subj ected to a force, can be urged toward one or the other cf the first and second interior walls 126, 128. At least a portion of the diaphragm 102 includes an electrically conductive material. in the example shown in Fig. 5 and 6, the diaphragm 10 2 is a thin metal membrane, so the entire diaphragm 102<br><br>
is conductive. An axis 99, for reference, is shown extending perpendicularly from the center of the diaphragm 102 and through the cell body 98.<br>
The diaphragm 10 2 separates the interior cavity 100 into a first cavity 132 and a second cavity 134. In the example shown, the diaphragm 102 and the first interior wall 12 6 define the first cavity 13 2, The diaphragm 102 and the second interior wall 128 define the second cavity 134, which is generally opposite the diaphragm 102 from the first cavity 132. The interior walls 126, 128 are seoarated into edae regions 136, 138, respectively, and center regions 14 0, 14 2, respectively. The portions of each interior wall 12 6, 12 8 proximate the region where the interior wall 126, 128 contacts the diaphragm 102 are the edge regions 136, 138. Likewise, the portions of each interior wall 126, 128 including the region where the axis 99 extends through the interior walls 126, 128 are the center regions 140, 142. The edge regions 136, 138 of each interior wall 126, 128 surround the respective center reaions 140, 142. The ratio of the area of the edge regions 13 6, 13 8 and center regions 14 0, 142 can vary. In the example shown, the insulator 120 extends to the diaphragm forming the interior walls 126, 128, In other versions, the insulator 120 does not extend to the diaphragm 102, and the interior walls 126, 128 include a region formed in the cup-like halves 116, 118, this region proximate the diaphragm 102.<br>
Dielectric fill-fluid 95 fills each of the first cavity 132,  the  second  cavity 134,  openings  122,<br><br>
isolation tubes 94, and isolation chambers 92. During manufacture of the sensor 96, the fill-fluid 95 is injected into the sensor 96 to fill in the isolation tubes 94. The fill-fluid 95 is compatible with the sensor' 56, and examples of known dielectric fill-fluids include silicone oil, inert haiocarbcn, and others. In the example, the same type of f ill -fluid 95 is used in both cavities 132, 134. The dielectric fill-fluid 95 substantially increases the capacitance of the sensor 96 over a comparable air-filled device, but the dielectric constant of the fill-fluid 95 varies as a function of temperature and pressure. Generally the volume of fill-fluid 95 in the first cavity is equal to the volume of fill-fluid 95 in the second cavity 134. As one or both of the isolation diaphragms 9 0 deflect or flex, fill-fluid 95 is displaced in the cavities 132, 134, and the fill-fluid exerts a force against the diaphragm 102. This force generally corresponds with the force applied to the isolation diaphragms 90 by the variable process pressure 54. Differences between the forces exerted on the diaphragm from each cavity cause the diaphragm to deflect, or be' displaced.<br>
In one version, the diaphragm 102 will touch and rest against either of the interior walls 126, 128 before either of the isolation diaphragms 90 are fully deflected within their respective isolation chambers 92 and before remarkable damage will result to the diaphragm 102 . In this manner, the interior walls 126, 128 act as over-pressure stops and protect the diaphragm 102.  Similarly, the spherical shape of<br><br>
the concave interior walls 126, 128 is such that generally the entire diaphragm 102 will rest against either wall 126 or 123 to protect the diaphragm 1G2 from localized permanent deformations.<br>
A thin metal coating, or a first "electrode' 144, is coupled to the first interior wail 126. In the example shown, the first electrode 144 is deposited on the first interior wall 126 and positioned within the first interior cavity 132. Methods of depositing the electrodes include sputtering, physical or chemical vapor deposition, plasma deposition, silk screening, or other suitable methods of coupling the electrode to the interior wall. The thickness of the electrode is exaggerated in the Figs, for clarity. The electrode 144 is in the center region 140 of the first interior wall 126, is proximate the ceramic tube 125, and is opposite the first interior cavity 126 from the diaphragm 102. The first electrode 144 is directly connected to lead wire 1C4 that is imbedded in the insulator 12 0 and extends through ceramic plug 109 in opening 111.<br>
A second electrode 146 also is coupled to the first interior wall by a suitable deposition method. In the example shown, the second electrode 14 6 is sputtered on the first interior wall 126 within the first interior cavity 132, and is opposite the first interior cavity 132 from the diaphragm 102. The thickness of the electrode is exaggerated in the Figs. for clarity. The second electrode 146 is in edge region 13 6, or at a distance further along the interior wall 12 6 from the axis 99 than the distance<br><br>
of the first electrode 114 along the interior wall 126 from the axis 99. The electrodes 144, 145 are spaced-apart across the insulator 120 from each other and the diaphragm, so that the electrodes do not directly contact each other or the diaphragm. In the example shown in Fig, 6, the second electrode 146 extends around the first electrode 144. The second electrode 146 is directly connected to lead wire 106, which is spaced-apart from and not in direct contact with lead wire 104, and also extends through ceramic plug 10 9 in opening 111. A thin deposit of silicon monoxide (not shown) or other suitable insulator covers the electrodes 144, 146 to prevent direct contact with the diaphragm 102 in over-pressure situations.<br>
The electrodes 144, 146, 148, 150 can be of a variety of configurations. Fig. 6 shows that the second electrode 14 6 is formed of two electrode-halves 145 and 147, in the edge region 13 6, that surround the first electrode 144. The electrode halves 145, 147 are spaced-apart from one another on the first interior wall 126, but are directly coupled together within insulator 120 of the cell body 98 and to lead wire 106. Figs, 7-9 show other examples of the sensor 56. In Fig. 7, electrode 1146 is analogous to the electrode 146 of Fig. 6, and is the "second electrode." Electrode 1146 extends only partially around the first electrode 144, and is also coupled to lead wire 106. In Fig. 8, electrode 2146 is the "second electrode" and is in the shaoe of a ring thac completely surrounds the first electrode<br><br>
144. In Fig. 9, electrode 3146 is the "second electrode" and is of an arbitrary shape in the edge region 13 6. Other shapes or configurations of the second electrode are contemplated. For example, the "second electrode" can be merely the end of the lead wire 10 6 left exposed to the interior cavity 10 0 with no other metal coat coupled to the first inferior wall 125. The various shapes for the second electrode 14 6 can also be used with the fourth electrode 15 0. Similarly, the first and third electrodes 144, 148 can be of a variety of shapes. For example the first and third electrodes 144, 148 can be pie-shaped or an arbitrary shape.<br>
The electrodes 144, 14 6 operate as capacitor elements, or capacitor plates, and each are electrically coupled via an electric field, i.e. "capacitively coupled," across the dielectric fill-fluid 95 to the diaphragm 102. The diaphragm 102 also operates as another capacitor plate, and there is no direct connection between the diaphragm 102 and either electrode 144 or 146. Thus, the first electrode 144 and the diaohracrm 102 form a first capacitor, and the second electrode 14 6 and the diaphragm 102 form a second capacitor. The term "capacitor" is used to describe the structure even though the "capacitor plates" (including the diaphragm.) are nor always charged. Thus, for example, the first electrode 144 and the diaphragm 102 are considered "capacitively coupled" even when they are not charged. The diaphragm 102 operates as a caoacitcr elate common to both the first and second<br><br>
capacitors. Electrodes 144, 146 are fixed with respect to the movable diaphragm 102, and thus the first and second capacitors are "variable capacitors." The capacitance of each variable capacitor will change as the diaphragm is deflected. Specifically, the capacitance of a capacitor generally is proportional to the inverse of the distance between the capacitor plates of the capacitor.<br>
During operation, the sensor electronics 60 provides a signal to charge the diaphragm 102. As the diaphragm 102 deflects within the interior cavity 100 in response to the applied process pressure, the distance between the diaphragm and each electrode 144, 146 changes. -This creates a change in the capacitance of each capacitor, which is a function of the process pressure 54. The lead wires 104, 106 and diaphragm 102 are each directly coupled to the sensor electronics board 112. The charge on electrode 144 and lead wire 104 is a function of the capacitance of the first capacitor, and the charge on electrode 146 and lead wire 106 is a function of the capacitance of the second capacitor. The sensor electronics 60 measures the variable capacitances, which can be used to establish the applied process pressure.<br>
A third electrode 148 is coupled to the second interior wall 12 5 and positioned within the second interior cavity 134. One method of coupling the electrode 14 S is through sputtering. The thickness of the electrode is exaggerated in the Figs, for claritv.   The third electrode 148 is in the center<br><br>
region 142 of the second interior wall 12 8, is opposite the second interior cavity 12 8 from the diaphragm 102, is similar in size and shape to the first electrode 144, and is opposite the interior cavity 100 from the first electrode. The third electrode 14 8 is fixed with respect to the diaphragm 102, and the third electrode 14S and the deflectable diaphragm form a third variable capacitor. The third electrode 14 8 is directly connected to lead wire 10 3 that is imbedded in the insulator 12 0 and extends through ceramic plug 115 in opening 113 .<br>
A fourth electrode 150 is coupled to the second interior wall 128 within the second interior cavity 134 in the edge region 138 of the second interior wall 128. One method of coupling the fourth electrode 150 is through sputtering. The thickness of the electrode is exaggerated in the Figs, for clarity. The fourth electrode 15 0 is opposite the second interior cavity 134 from the diaphragm 102, is similar in size and shape to the second electrode 146, and is positioned opposite the interior cavity 100 from the second electrode 146. The electrodes 14 8, 150 are spaced-apart across the insulator 12 0 from each other and the diaphragm 102, so that the electrodes 148, 150 do net directly contact each other or the diaphragm 102. The fourth electrode 150 is directly connected to lead wire 110, which is spaced-apart from and not in direct contact with lead wire 108, and also extends through ceramic plug 115 in opening 113,  Alternatively, the fourth electrode<br><br>
150 can be merely the end of lead wire 110 exposed to cavity 128 .<br>
The third and fourth electrodes 14S and 15 0 each serve as capacitor plates for separate capacitors. The third electrode 148 is capacitively coupled tc the diaphragm 102 to form a third variable capacitor, and the fourth electrode 15 0 is capacitively coupled to the diaphragm 102 to form a fourth variable capacitor. The third and fourth capacitors are formed in a manner similar to the first and second capacitors, but on the second half-cell 118. A lack of symmetry between the electrodes 144, 146 on the first interior wall 126 and the electrodes 148, 150 on the second interior wall 128 is also contemplated. The example of Fig. 10 does not include a fourth electrode and corresponding lead wire, and thus does not include a fourth capacitor. In the example, the third electrode 148 is opposite the first electrode 144, although the third electrode in this configuration can be placed anywhere on the second interior wall 128.<br>
Fig. 4 shows lead wires 104, 106, 108, 110 connected to the electronics board 112, and Fig. 3 indicates that the sensor 56 is operably coupled to an analog to" digital converter 62, such as a capacitance-to-digital converter. The analog to digital converter 62 is connected to other electronics within the transmitter 36, or "transmitter electronics," as described above with reference to Figs. 2 and 3 . Various analog to digital converters are known that convert an analoa incut to<br><br>
a digital output and are acceptable for use with the process pressure transmitter 36. One type of analog to digital converter 62 is a sigma delta, or known by its symbol LA. One feature that distinguishes a sigma delta circuit from other types of analog to digital converters is that the sigma delta converter provides a balancing current with a polarity controlled by a clocked controller coupling to an integrator. The analog to digital converter 62 includes a sigma delta circuit and can be implemented as an application specific integrated circuit. In one example, the application specific integrated circuit is on the sensor electronics board 112 and proximate the sensor 56, The application specific integrated circuit, however, can be disposed within the explosion proof housing of the transmitter 36. The application specific integrated circuit can include other circuit elements, as needed or desired, to provide additional functions in addition to that of the sigma delta circuit. One such function can be to determine the capacitance of the sensor capacitors and provide an output that is a function of the process pressure.<br>
Figs .11-14 show a few examples of the sensor 5 6 connected to the analog to digital converter 6 2 . In each of the illustrated examples, the lead wires 104, 106, 108, 110, and thus the electrodes 144, 146, 14S, 15C, are electrically coupled to the analog to digital converter 62, implemented as an application soecific intearated circuit 151 in Fia, 11 and as 152<br><br>
in Figs. 12 - 14, which provide output 148 .  Circuit<br>
151	of Fig, 11 includes circuit 152 and additional circuit elements or electrical connections. Application specific integrated circuit 152 is known 'in the art and can be used with related art sensors. Circuit 152 is used in the Model 3051C Process Pressure Transmitter manufactured and sold by Rcsemount Inc., of Eden Prairie, Minnesota.   Circuit<br>
152	in Figs. 12 - 14 includes a sensor excitation output 155 electrically coupled to the diaphragm 102 to electrically charge the diaphragm and generate an electric field within the interior cavity 100, The circuit 152 also includes a capacitance high input 153, a capacitance low input 154, which are electrically coupled to the electrodes 144 - 150, and a linearization capacitor excitation terminal 156.<br>
Figs. 12 and 13 show the first and fourth electrodes 144, 150 electrically coupled together outside of the interior cavity 100 at a first node 161, and the second and third electrodes 146, 148 are electrically coupled together outside of che interior cavity 100 at a second node 162. The first and second nodes 161, 162 are electrically coupled to circuit 152. Specifically, the first node 161 is electrically connected directly to the capacitance high input 153 and the second node is electrically connected directly to the capacitance low input 154. Linearization capacitors 157, 158 are connected between nodes 161, 162, respectively, and node 159, which is provided to terminal 156. Fig. 12 shows lead wires 104 and 110 bonded together tc form node<br><br>
161, and lead wires 10 6, 10 8 bonded together to form node 162. In Fig, 13, a first adjustment capacitor 165 is electrically connected between the fourth electrode 150 and the first node 161. Also, a second adjustment capacitor 167 is electrically connected between the second electrode 14 6 and the second node 162 .<br>
Fig. 14 shows the first and second electrodes 144, 146 electrically coupled together outside of the interior cavity 100 at a third node 163, and the third and fourth electrodes 14 8, 150 electrically coupled together outside of the interior cavity 100 at a fourth node 164. A first inverting charge amplifier 166 is electrically connected to the second electrode 146 and its output provided to the third node 163. A second inverting charge amplifier 168 is electrically connected to the fourth electrode 150 and its output provided to the fourth node 164. Inverting charge amplifiers are known in the art, and are generally defined by their function of amplifying and reversing the polarity of a charge signal. The third node and fourth nodes 163, 164 are electrically coupled directly to the capacitance high and low inputs 153, 154, respectively.<br>
Figs. 12-14 show that the circuit elements and nodes outside of the sensor are also separate from the application specific integrated circuit 152. These circuit elements can be located on the sensor electronics board 112 and then connected to circuit 152 also on board 112. Fig. 11 shows an example where an aDDlication soecific intearated circuit 151<br><br>
includes  the  circuit  152  and  additional  circuit elements in monolithic form such that any of the embodiments shown in Figs. 12 - 14 can be implemented as one microelectronic chip.   Circuit 151 can also include  other  circuit  elements  as  is  apt  for a particular application.   Lead wires 104,  10 6,  108, 110 are directly connected to the inputs 170, 172, 174, and 176 of circuit 151.   Circuit 151 includes the nodes and capacitors shown in Figs, 12 and 13, respectively,  or  the  nodes  and  inverting  charge amplifier shown in Fig. 14,<br>
Fig. 15 shows lead wires 104, 106, 10 8, 110 of sensor connected to application specific integrated circuit 17 8 at inputs 18 0, 182, 184, 186. Circuit 178 also includes sensor excitation output 181 and circuit output 18 3 , analogous to that of circuits 151 and 152. Circuit 178 is unlike circuit 151 in that circuit 178 uses a particular sigma delta converter other than that indicated as circuit 152.<br>
The diaphragm 102 is shown as straight and flat in Fig. 5 as indicative of equal pressures applied in the first and second cavities 132,  134.   When a pressure difference exists between the cavities 132, 134,  such as when the pressure in cavity 134  is greater  than  the  pressure  in  cavity  132,  the diaphragm deflects  from  its  original position as suggested in Fig. 16.  The thickness of the electrode is exaggerated in the Figs, for clarity.   Ideally, the shape of a deflected diaphragm 102 is parabolic, as show.: in Fig. 16.   The ideal parabolic shape of the  deflected  diaohracmi  aenerally  matches  the<br><br>
spherical contour of the first interior wall 126 (similarly, if the pressures were reversed, the shape of the deflected diaphragm would generally match the contour of the second interior wall 128) . Ideal deflection of the diaphragm as a percentage of the contour of the first interior wall is generally the same at all locations of the diaphragm. The percentage change in the variable capacitance also is the same as the diaphragm is urged toward the first interior wall 126 in this example. Accordingly, the first and second capacitors should measure the same ratiometrie changes in capacitance as the diaphragm is urged toward the first interior wall 126, and this capacitance is related to the applied process pressure.<br>
The diaphragm 102, however, does not deflect in such an ideal parabolic manner. Instead, the diaphragm 102 becomes offset but flat after it is initially deflected. For example, Fig. 17 shows diaphragm deformation when the pressures in both cavities 132, 134 are equal. The diaphragm 102 extends into one cavity or the other when ideally it should be flat throughout. The amount of offset shown in Figs. 17 and 18 are merely illustrative and exaggerate the actual amount of deformation. In general, this offset is caused by edge-bending moments originating at the region 152 where the diaphragm 102 physically contacts the first and second interior walls 126, 123. The edge-bending moments include edge frictional moments and yielding or creeping moments.  The amount of bendina alona the<br><br>
diaphragm is also exaggerated for clarity. For example, all of the electrodes 144, 146, 143, 150 in an actual sensor 5 6 are tyoicallv oooosite the flat portion of the offset diaohraam 102. Fia. IS shows diaphragm deformation when the pressure in cavity 134 is greater than the pressure in cavity 132. The diaphragm 102 deflects in a parabolic manner, but deflects from the offset state and thus includes an offset component. The amount of diaphragm deflection becomes the parabolic deflection as a result of the differential pressure added to the amount of diaphragm offset as a result of the edge-bending moments.<br>
The process of error compensation is introduced with reference to Fig, 19, which is a simplified schematic diagram of the sensor 56. Error compensation begins with the measurement of two distances of diaphragm deflection from a selected position, or reference plane, and subtracting one distance from the other to arrive at a value proportional to an error corrected output. For example, the selected position can be a reference plane 190 representative of an ideal diaphragm at rest. In this example, the diaphragm includes a center region 192 generally opposite the center region 140 of the first interior wall 126, and an edge region 194 generally opposite the edge region 136 of the first interior wall 126, The first distance XL is the distance of the diaphragm center region 192 to plane 190. The second distance X2 is the distance of the diaphragm edge region 194  to the<br><br>
plane 190. The second distance X2 is subtracted from the first distance Zx to provide a value proportional to an error corrected output of a differentia-pressure measurement, or R. Specifically, R = K (Xi -X:) .<br>
The value K can be unity cr some other constant. The value K is typically used to scale output and is often equal to or between (-1) and (1) . in one example, K is equal to the inverse of the value resulting from the distance X0i of the interior wall center region 140 to the plane 190 added to the distance X02 of the interior wall edge region 136 to the plane 190. Specifically, K = 1/ (X01 + Xo:) . In implementation of the sensor 96, X0i is obtained by measuring the distance between the center electrodes 144, 14 8 and dividing by two. In implementation of the sensor 96, X02 is obtained by measuring the distance between the edge electrodes 146, 150 and dividing by two.  Accordingly,<br>
R = (X- - X2) / (Xoi + X02) If the interior wall is curved, X01 does not equal X0z-This transfer function can be implemented in a variety of sensors having a dielectric fill-fluid in order to compensate for diaphragm deformation and changes in the dielectric constant of the fill-fluid, A sensor that lends itself to the implementation of this transfer function is the four-electrode sensor of Fig. 5. In a transfer function implemented by the three-electrode sensor cf Fig. 10, there is no value X0:.  Thus, K = 1/Xoi.  Accordingly,<br>
R = (Xi - X:) / Xoi<br><br>
The calculations and output can be provided by anyone of a variety of signal processing devices in addition to the application specific integrated circuits described above.<br>
A basic form of a transfer function used with the transmitter of Fig. 2 to provide an error compensated output in the measurement of process pressure makes use of four capacitance measurements provided by the sensor 5 6. The capacitance of the first capacitor is related to an electrical ■ signal at the first electrode 144 and is described as the first capacitance, or Cx. The capacitance of the second capacitor is related to an electrical signal at the second electrode 146 and is described as the second capacitance, or C2. The capacitance of the third capacitor is related to an electrical signal at the third electrode 148 and is described as the third capacitance, or C3. The capacitance of the fourth capacitor is related to an electrical signal at the fourth electrode 150 and is described as the fourth capacitance, or C4.<br>
The output R of the basic transfer function is indicative of a differential pressure measurement compensated for diaphragm deformation, One expression of the basic transfer function is shown in equation A:<br>
[A]  R = ( (C1-C3)-(C:-C4) ) / ((d+C3) - (C2 + C4)) In equation A, the fourth capacitance C4 is subtracted from the second capacitance C2 to obtain a first difference  (C: - C4) -   The third capacitance C3 is subtracted from the first capacitance CL to obtain a<br><br>
second difference (Ci - C3) - The first difference is subtracted from the second difference to obtain a numerator. The denominator includes a first sum of the second and fourth capacitances (C:+ CJ subtracted from a second sum cf the first and third capacitances (Ci + C3) . The numerator is divided by the denominator to obtain output R. These steps can be performed in another order cr several steps can be performed simultaneously.<br>
The basic transfer function of equation A is related to error compensation based on distance cf deflection, described above with reference to Fie. 19. The ratio of the capacitance of the edge electrode to the capacitance cf the center electrode is selected to improve performance of the sensor. For example, if Xai/X02 - (C: + C4) / (C: + CO, or C2/Cl = C4/C3 =  X01/X02, then<br>
R = (Xi - Xz) / (X01 + X02) . In practice, this suggests that the sire of the electrodes in the edge region, i.e. electrodes 146, 150, be quite small, or thin in the case of a ring or partial ring configuration. Another way to accomplish this result is if some or all cf the four capacitances related to the respective electrical signals are amplified, attenuated, or a combination of both before the transfer function is used to operate on the capacitances. Attenuation is also amplification; specifically, it is amplification by a gain of less than unity. ,Thus, the "raw" electrical signals actually present at the electrodes 144, 14£, 143, 150 each can be multiplied by a selected gain to provide<br><br>
electrical signals representative of the four capacitances suitable for implementation cf the transfer functions. In the sensor of Fig. 5, the raw electrical signals from electrodes 146 and 150 are amplified bv a crain of less than unity to provide signals used in the transfer function.<br>
Fig. 14 shows one implementation of the basic transfer function. Circuit 15 2 receives two inputs representative of capacitances at the capacitance high and low inputs 153, 154, which are abbreviated as Cu and CL. Circuit 152 receives the inputs and provides an output RL as expressed in Equation E:<br>
[B]  R, = (CL - CK) / (CH + CL)<br>
The input 153 receives a signal CL which is equal to<br>
(Ci - Cz) ; and input 154 receives a signal CH which is<br>
equal  to  (C3 - CA) .■	Accordingly,  the  output  cf<br>
circuit 152 is expressed as Equation C: [C]  Ri = {(d-C2) - (C3-C4)) / ((C!-C2) + (C3-C4))<br>
Often, stray capacitances are introduced into the capacitance measurements of the sensor 96. As a result, each capacitance term in Equation A can include a main capacitance term representative of the capacitance between the electrode and the diaphragm 102, and a stray capacitance. For example, the first capacitance can include a first main capacitance and a first stray capacitance such that Ci - (C1M+CiS) . Similarly, C2    =     (C:M+C2s) , C2    =  (C3M+C3S) ,  and C4    -<br>
The implementation of Fig. 14 contemplates the effect of stray capacitances. When the gains on inverting charge amplifiers 1S£, 1SS are set to (-1) ,<br><br>
the transfer function of the implementation is independent of stray capacitance if Cis=CZ£=C3s=C43 - In general, however, the first inverting charge amplifier 166 inverts the polarity of C2 and multiplies the result by a gain Ai; and the second inverting charge amplifier 16 8 inverts the polarity of C4 and multiplies the result by a gain A2. Thus; an expression of the output of the configuration of Fig. 14, consistent with the basic transfer function, is<br><br>
The  desired  compensation  can  be  accomplished  by<br>
adjusting the gains Ai and A2, The effect of stray capacitance can be reduced by an optimum design of a sensor, and gains Ax and A2 can be adjusted independently of each other to compensate for any lack of physical symmetry.<br>
Figs 12 and 13 show two examples of another implementation of the basic transfer function. An expression of the basic transfer function is shown as Equation D:<br>
[D] R = ({Ci + C4)-(C2 + C3)) / ((Cx + C4) + (C2 + C3)) Equation E is consistent with the expression of Equation A- In Equation D, the first capacitance Ci is added to the fourth capacitance C4 to obtain a first sum (Ci + C4) - The second capacitance C2 is added to the third capacitance C3 to obtain a second sum (C2 -r C3) , The first sum is added to the second sum to obtain the denominator, and the second sum is<br><br>
subtracted from the first sum to obtain the numerator- The numerator is divided by the denominator to obtain the output R.<br>
Additional capacitance values are included in implementation of the transfer function for the example of Fig. 12. The implementation also is susceptible to the effects of stray capacitance. In one design of the sensor, the four stray capacitances are equal to each other. In another design, the stray capacitances are effectively eliminated. The example also includes two linearization capacitors -157, 158, which introduce linearisation capacitances CLi and CL2, respectively, that effect the transfer function. Thus, an expression of the output R2 of the configuration of Fig. 12 taking into account the linearization capacitances and stray capacitances is-.<br><br>
The step of adding the first capacitance Ci to the fourth capacitance C4 in Equation D includes subtracting  a  first  linearization  capacitance  CL1<br>
related to an electrical signal at a first linearization capacitor 157 from the first or fourth capacitance to obtain the first sum. Also, the step of adding the third capacitance C^ to the second capacitance C: in Equation D includes subtracting a second linearization capacitance C— related to an electrical signal at a second linearization capacitor<br><br>
158 from the second or third capacitance to obtain the second sum.<br>
Swill additional capacitance values are included in the implementation of the transfer function for the example of Fig. 13. The example includes two adjustment capacitors 165, 167, which introduce adjustment capacitances CAi and CA;, respectively, that effect the transfer function. Thus, an expression of the output R3 of the configuration is shown in Equation E:<br><br>
The second capacitance C2 of Equation D becomes a<br>
second effective capacitance C:E in Equation E, and is expressed as:<br>
C:z = C2A (C2M + C2s)  /  (CA2 + C2M + C2S)<br>
The second effective capacitance C2z includes the second adjustment capacitance CA: multiplied by the sum of the second main capacitance C2M and second stray capacitance Czs and divided by the sum of the second adjustment capacitance CA2, second main capacitance C2M and second stray capacitance C2S •<br>
The fourth capacitance C4 of Equation D becomes a fourth effective capacitance (C4z) in Equation E, and is expressed as:<br>
C4Z  -   CAI(C4M+C4S)    /    (CAi + C4M+C4S)<br>
The fourth effective capacitance C4E includes the first adjustment caoacitance C- multiolied bv the sum of the fourth main capacitance C4M and fourth stray<br><br>
capacitance C4s and divided by the sum of the first adjustment capacitance CA1, fourth main capacitance C4.M and fourth stray capacitance C45-<br>
Equation A can be implemented in many forms. For example, circuit 178 cf Fig. 15 receives electrical signals related to the four capacitances from lead wires 104, 106, 105, 110. Circuit 178 then processes the signals to generate an output consistent with the basic transfer function set forth in Equation A.<br>
The equation R = (X1 - Xz) / Xall described above, can be implemented with a sensor having three capacitors, similar to the sensor of Fig. 10. The capacitance of the first capacitor is related to an electrical signal at the first electrode 144 and is described as the first capacitance, or Ci. The capacitance of the second capacitor is related to an electrical signal at the second electrode 146 and is described as the second capacitance, or C2 - The capacitance of the third capacitor is related to an electrical signal at the third electrode 14 8 and is described as the third capacitance, or C3.<br>
