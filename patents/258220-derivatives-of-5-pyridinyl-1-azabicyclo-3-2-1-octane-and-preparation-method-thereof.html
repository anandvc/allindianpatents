The present invention relates to 5-pyridyl-1-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octane derivatives, to their preparation and to their therapeutic use.<br>

There is still a need to find and develop products with affinity for the nicotinic receptors and that are selective towards nicotinic receptors containing the a7 subunit.<br>
The invention satisfies this aim by proposing novel compounds, which show good affinity for the nicotinic receptors and good selectivity towards nicotinic receptors containing the a7 subunit.<br>

In the text hereinbelow, the term "protecting group" means a group that makes it possible, firstly, to protect a reactive function such as a hydroxyl or an amine during a synthesis and, secondly, to regenerate the intact reactive function at the end of the synthesis. Examples of protecting groups and of protection and deprotection methods are given in "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis", Green et al., 2nd Edition (John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York), 1991.<br>
In the text hereinbelow, the term "leaving group" means a group that may be readily cleaved from a molecule by breaking a heterolytic bond, with loss of an electron pair. This group may thus be readily replaced with another group, for example during a substitution reaction. Such leaving groups are, for example, halogens or an activated hydroxyl group such as a methanesulfonate, benzenesulfonate, p-toluenesulfonate, triflate, acetate, etc. Examples of leaving groups and references for their preparation are given in "Advances in Organic Chemistry", J. March, 3rd Edition, Wiley Interscience, 1985, p. 310-316.<br>
The compounds of general formula (I) may be prepared via a process illustrated according to Scheme 1 below.<br>
An addition reaction is performed on the lithiated anion of a heterocyclic compound of general formula (III), in which Z represents a bromine atom and W represents a halogen atom, in the presence of 3-oxo-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, of formula (II). The lithiated anion of the heterocyclic compound of general formula (III) is obtained by halogen-metal exchange with an alkyllithium derivative.<br>
The compound of formula (IV) is obtained and, when treated in hot acidic medium, leads to the compound of formula (V).<br>
Catalytic hydrogenation of the double bond leads to the compound of formula (VI).<br>
The compounds of general formula (I), in which the carbon-carbon bond between<br><br>
positions 3 and 4 of the azabicyclooctane ring is a double bond and R represents an optionally substituted pyrazolyl, imidazolyl, triazplyl, oxazolyl, oxadiazolyl, thiazolyl, isothiazolyl, thiadiazolyl or tetrazolyl group, are obtained from the compound of formula (V) in which Z represents a bromine atom.<br><br><br>
The compounds of general formula (I), in which the carbon-carbon bond between positions 3 and 4 of the azabicyclooctane ring is a single bond and R represents an optionally substituted pyrazolyl, imidazolyl, triazolyl, oxazolyl, oxadiazolyl, thiazolyl, isothiazolyl, thiadiazolyl or tetrazolyl group, are obtained from the compound of formula (VI) in which Z represents a bromine atom.<br>
The substituent R may thus be introduced onto the compound of formula (V) or (VI) in which Z represents a bromine atom according to any method known to those skilled in the art, for instance:<br><br>
-	with a boronic acid of formula R-B(OH)2 in which R is as defined in the general formula (I), in the presence of a palladium catalyst, for example tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium;<br>
-	with a compound of formula R-H in which R is as defined in the general formula (I), in the presence of a strong base, for example sodium hydride, in a solvent, for example dimethylformamide;<br>
-	with a stannous derivative of formula R-Sn[(CH2)3CH3)]3 in which R is as defined in the general formula (I), in the presence of a palladium catalyst, for example bis(triphenylphosphino)dichloropalladium;<br>
-	with a compound of formula R-H in which R is as defined in the general formula (I), in the presence of n-butyllithium, zinc chloride and a palladium catalyst, for example tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium.<br>
The compounds of general formula (I) in which the carbon-carbon bond between positions 3 and 4 of the azabicyclooctane ring is a single bond and R represents an optionally substituted triazolyl, oxadiazolyl or tetrazolyl group may also be prepared from the compound of formula (VII).<br>
For example: <br>
-	when R represents a triazolyl group, the compound of formula (I) may be obtained from the compound of formula (VII) in the presence of a strong base, such as a solution of sodium methoxide, and of formic hydrazide in a solvent such as methanol;<br>
-	when R represents an oxadiazolyl group, the compound of formula (I) may be obtained in two steps from the compound of formula (VII),<br>
first converted into the N-hydroxycarboxamidine of formula (VIII)<br><br>
for example in the presence of hydroxylamine hydrochloride in basic medium,<br><br>
the compound of formula (VIII) thus obtained then reacting with acetic anhydride in a solvent such as pyridine to give the expected compound of formula (I); - when R represents a tetrazolyl group, the compound of formula (I) may be obtained from the compound of formula (VII) in the presence of sodium azide and ammonium chloride in a solvent such as dimethylformamide.<br>
The compound of formula (VII) is prepared from the compound of formula (VI), in which Z represents a bromine atom, for example in the presence of potassium cyanide and tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium in a solvent such as dimethylformamide.<br>
The preparation of the compound of formula (V) in which R represents a bromine atom is described in WO 03/057 697.<br>
3-Oxo-l-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane of formula (II) is commercially available.<br>
The compounds of general formula (III) are commercially available or are available via methods described in the literature.<br>
In Scheme 1, the starting compounds and the reagents, when their mode of preparation is not described, are commercially available or described in the literature, or may be prepared according to methods described therein or known to those skilled in the art.<br>
According to another of its aspects, a subject of the invention is also the compounds of formulae (IV), (V), (VI), (VII) and (VIII). These compounds are useful as intermediates for the synthesis of the compounds of general formula (I).<br>
The examples that follow describe the preparation of certain compounds in accordance with the invention. These examples are not limiting and merely illustrate the present invention. The compound numbers given in parentheses in the titles refer to those given in the first column of the table below, which illustrates the chemical structures and the physical properties of a few compounds according to the invention.<br><br>
Example 1 (compound 1)<br>

1.1	5-(2-Bromopyrid-5-yl)-1 -azabicyclo[3.2.1 ]octane hydrobromide (1:1)<br>
1.95 g (7.354 mmol) of 5-(2-bromopyrid-5-yl)-1-azabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-3-ene (WO 03/057 697) are introduced into 40 ml of methanol in a hydrogenation flask, and 195 mg of platinum oxide are then placed in suspension. The medium is stirred at room temperature under a hydrogen pressure of 26 psi for 45 minutes. The reaction medium is filtered through diatomaceous earth and the solvent is removed by evaporation under reduced pressure. The residue obtained is purified by chromatography on a column of silica gel, eluting with a mixture of chloroform, methanol and aqueous ammonia in 95/5/0.5 proportions. 1.4 g of 5-(2-bromopyrid-5-yl)-1-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octane are obtained in the form of a waxy oil.<br>
The hydrobromide salt (1:1) of 5-(2-bromopyrid-5-yl)-1-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octane is then obtained by adding 1 equivalent of a 5.7 N solution of hydrobromic acid in acetic acid. 1.82 g of expected product are obtained.<br>

It is cooled to room temperature, the solvent is evaporated off under reduced pressure and the residue is taken up in 10 ml of chloroform and filtered through diatomaceous earth. The solvent is concentrated under reduced pressure and the residue is purified by chromatography on a column of silica gel, eluting with a mixture of chloroform, methanol and aqueous ammonia in 95/5/0.5 proportions. 0.15 g of (-)-5-[2-(1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)pyrid-5-yl]-1-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octane is obtained, and is dissolved in 2 ml of isopropyl alcohol to add 0.196 ml of a 5.7N solution of hydrobromic acid in acetic acid. The crystals obtained are collected by filtration and dried under vacuum. 0.163 g of product is obtained. Melting point: 259-261 °C.<br>

On the day of the experiment, the tissue is thawed slowly and suspended in 5 volumes of buffer. 150 ul of this membrane suspension is preincubated at 37°C for 30 min, in the dark, in the presence or absence of the test compound. Next, the membranes are incubated for 60 min at 37°C, in the dark, in the presence of 50 ul of 1 nM [3H]-a-bungarotoxin in a final volume of 250 ul of 20 mM HEPES buffer.

The final pellet is taken up in 10 volumes of Tris-HCI buffer at 4°C. 100 ul of membrane, i.e. 10 mg of fresh tissue, are incubated at 24°C for 3 hours in the presence of 50 ul of 0.66 final nM [3H]-epibatidine in a final volume of 250 ul of buffer, in the presence or absence of test compound. The reaction is stopped by diluting the samples with 50 uM pH 7.4 Tris-HCI buffer at 4°C, followed by filtration through Whatman GF/C™ filters pretreated for 3 hours with 0.5% polyethyleneimine. The filters are rinsed twice with 5 ml of buffer and the radioactivity retained on the filter is measured by liquid scintigraphy. The non-specific binding in the presence of 2 mM final (-)-nicotine is determined; the non-specific binding represents 30% to 40% of the total binding recovered on the filter. For each concentration of test product, the percentage of inhibition of the specific binding of [3H]-epibatidine is determined, and the IC50, the concentration of compound that inhibits 50% of the specific binding, is then calculated.<br>
The IC50 values for the compounds of the invention are between 1 and 10 uM.<br>
The results obtained show that certain compounds of the invention are selective ligands for the a7 subunit of the nicotinic receptor and that others are mixed a4(32<br><br>
These results suggest the use of the compounds in the treatment or prevention of disorders associated with dysfunction of the nicotinic receptors, especially in the central nervous system.<br>
These disorders 1 comprise cognitive impairment, more specifically memory impairment (acquisition, consolidation and recall), but also attention impairment, and executive function disorders associated with Alzheimer's disease, pathological ageing (Age Associated Memory Impairment, AAMI) or normal ageing (senile dementia), Parkinson's disease, trisomy 21 (Down's syndrome), psychiatric pathologies (in particular cognitive disorders associated with schizophrenia), Korsakoff's alcoholic syndrome, vascular dementia (multi-infarct dementia, MID) and cranial trauma.<br>
The compounds of the invention may also be useful in the treatment of the motor disorders observed in Parkinson's disease or other neurological diseases such as Huntington's chorea, Tourette's syndrome, tardive dyskinesia and hyperkinesia.<br>
They may also have neuroprotective therapeutic activity with respect to anatomo-histopathological complaints associated with the abovementioned neurodegenerative diseases.<br>
The compounds of the invention can also constitute a curative or symptomatic treatment for strokes and cerebral hypoxic episodes. They may be used in cases of psychiatric pathologies: schizophrenia (positive and/or negative symptoms), bipolar disorders, depression, anxiety, panic attacks, attention disorders with hyperactivity, and compulsive and obsessive behaviour.<br>
They can prevent the symptoms caused by withdrawal from tobacco, from alcohol or from various substances that induce dependency, such as cocaine, LSD, cannabis and benzodiazepines.<br>
They may be useful in the treatment of pain of diverse origin (including chronic, neuropathic or inflammation-related pain).<br><br>
Moreover, the compounds of the invention may be used for treating ischaemia of the lower limbs, obliterative arteritis of the lower limbs (PAD: peripheral arterial disease), cardiac ischaemia (stable angor), myocardial infarction, cardiac insufficiency, skin cicatrization deficiency of diabetic patients, and varicose ulcers of venous insufficiency.<br>
The compounds of the invention may also be used for treating inflammatory processes of diverse origins, in particular inflammations concerning the central nervous system.<br>
