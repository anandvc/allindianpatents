				<td>SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR PROTECTING A COMPUTING DEVICE FROM COMPUTER EXPLOITS DELIVERED OVER A NETV/ORKED ENVIRONMENT IN A<br>
SECURED COMMUNICATION<br>
CROSS-RF,FERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/544,772, filed February 13, 2004.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a system and method for protecting a computing device from computer exploits delivered over a networked environment in a secured communication.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION As more and more computers, and other computmg devices, are inter-connected through various networks, such as the Internet, computer security has become increasingly more important, particularly from invasions or attacks delivered over a network or over an information stream. As those skilled in the art will recognize, these attacks come in many different forms, including, but certainly not limited to, computer viruses, ccm.puter worms, system component replacements, denial of service attacks, even misuse/abuse of legitimate computer system features, all of which exploit one or more computer system vulnerabilities for illegitimate purposes. While those skilled in the art will realize that the various computer attacks are technically distinct from one another, for purposes of the present invention and<br>
for simplicity in description, all of these attacks will be generally referred to hereafter as computer exploits, or more simply, exploits.<br>
When a computer system is attacked or "infected" by a computer exploit, the adverse results are varied, including disabling system devices; erasing or corrupting firmware, applications, or data files; transmitting potentially sensitive data to another location on the network; shutting down the computer system; or causing the computer system to crash. Yet another pernicious aspect of many, though not all, computer exploits is that an infected computer system is used to infect other computers.<br>
FIGURE 1 is a pictorial diagram illustrating an exemplary networked environment 100 over which a computer exploit is commonly distributed. As shown in FIGURE 1, the typical exemplary networked environment 100 includes a plurality of computers 102-108 all inter-connected via a communication network 110, such as an intranet or via a larger communication network including the global TCP/IP network commonly referred to as the Internet. For whatever reason, a malicious party on a computer connected to tlie network 110, such as computer 102, develops a computer exploit 112 and releases it on the network. The released computer exploit 112 is received by, and infects, one or more computers, such as computer 104, as indicated by arrow 114. As is typical with many computer exploits, once infected, computer 104 is used to infect other computers, such as computer 106 as indicated by arrow 116, which in turn infects yet other computers, such as computer 108 as indicated by arrow 118. Clearly, due to the speed and reach of the modem computer networks, a computer exploit 112 can "grow" at an exponential rate, and quickly become a local epidemic that quickly escalates into a global computer pandemic.<br>
A traditional defense against computer exploits, and particularly computer viruses and worms, is anti-virus software. Generally, anti-virus software scans incoming data, arriving over a network, looking for identifiable patterns associated with known computer exploits. Upon detecting a pattern associated with a known computer exploit, the anti-virus software may respond by removing the computer virus from the infected data, quarantining the data, or deleting the "infected" incoming data. Unfortunately, anti-virus software typically works with "known," identifiable computer exploits. Frequently, this is done by matching pattems within the data to what is referred to as a "signature" of the exploit.  One<br>
of the core deficiencies in this exploit detection model is that an unknown computer exploit may propagate unchecked in a network until a computer's anti-virus software is updated to identify and respond to the new computer exploit.<br>
As anti-virus software has become more sophisticated and efficient at recognizing thousands of known computer exploits, so too have the computer exploits become more sophisticated. For example, many recent computer exploits are now polymorphic, or in other words, have no identifiable pattern or "signature" by which they can be recognized by anti-vims software in transit. These polymorphic exploits are frequently unrecognizable by anti-virus software because they modify themselves before propagating to another computer system.<br>
Another defense that is common today in protecting against computer exploits is a hardware or software network firewall. As those skilled in the art will recognize, a firewall is a security system that protects an internal network from unauthorized access originating fi"om external networks by controlling the flow of information between the internal network and the external networks. All communications originating outside of the firewall are first sent to a proxy that examines the communication, and determines whether it is safe or permissible to forward the communication to the intended target. Unfortunately, properly configuring a firewall so that permissible network activities are uninhibited and that impermissible network activities are denied is a sophisticated and complicated task. In addition to being technically complex, a firewall configuration is difficult to manage. When firewalls are improperly configured, permissible network traffic may be inadvertently shut down and impermissible network traffic may be allowed through, compromising the internal network. For this reason, changes to firewalls are generally made infrequently, and only by those well versed in the subject of technical network design.<br>
As yet a further limitation of firewalls, while a firewall protects an internal network, it does not provide any protection for specific computers. In other words, a firewall does not adapt itself to a specific computer's needs. Instead, even if a firewall is used to protect a single computer, it still protects that computer according to the firewall's configuration, not according to the single computer's configuration.<br>
Yet another issue related to firewalls is that they do not provide protection from computer exploits originating within the borders established by a firewall. In other words, once an exploit is able to penetrate the network protected by a firewall, the exploit is uninhibited by the firewall. This situation frequently arises when an employee takes a portable computer home (i.e., outside of the corporate firewall protection) and uses it at home in a less secured environment. Unknown to the employee, the portable computer is then infected. When the portable computer is reconnected to the corporate network within the protection of the firewall, the exploit is often free to infect other computers unchecked by the firewall.<br>
As mentioned above, computer exploits now also leverage legitimate computer system features in an attack. Thus, many parties other than firewall and anti-virus software providers must now join in defending computers from these computer exploits. For example, operating system providers must now, for economic and contractual reasons, continually analyze their operating system functions to identify weaknesses or vulnerabilities that may be used by a computer exploit. For purposes of the present discussion, any avenue by which a computer exploit may attack a computer system will be generally referred to as a computer system vulnerability, or simply a vulnerability.<br>
As vulnerabilities are identified and addressed in an operating system, or other computer system components, drivers, applications, the provider will typically release a software update to remedy the vulnerability. These updates, frequently referred to as patches, should be installed on a computer system in order to secure the computer system from the identified vulnerabilities. However, these updates are, in essence, code changes to components of the operating system, device drivers, or software applications. As such, they cannot be released as rapidly and freely as anti-virus updates from anti-virus software providers. Because these updates are code changes, the software updates require substantial in-house testing prior to being released to the public. Unfortunately, even with in-house testing, a software update may cause one or more other computer system features to break or malfunction. Thus, software updates create a huge dilemma to parties that rely upon the computer systems. More specifically, does a party update their computer systems to protect them from the vulnerability and risk disrupting their computer systems' operations, or does<br>
the party refrain from updating their computer systems and run the risk that their computer systems may be infected?<br>
Under the present system, there is a period of time, referred to hereafter as a vulnerability window, that exists between when a new computer exploit is released on the network 110 and when a computer system is updated to protect it from the computer exploit. As the name suggests, it is during this vulnerability window that a computer system is vulnerable, or exposed, to the new computer exploit. FIGURES 2A-2B are block diagrams of exemplary timelines illustrating this vulnerability window. In regard to the following discussions regarding timelines, significant times or events v/ill be identified and referred to as events in regard to a timeline.<br>
FIGURE 2A illustrates a vulnerability window of computer systems with regard to one of the more recent, sophisticated class of computer exploits that are now being released on public networks. As will be described below, this new class of computer exploits take advantage of a system provider's proactive security measures to identify computer system vulnerabilities, and subsequently, create and deliver a computer exploit.<br>
With reference to FIGURE 2A, at event 202, an operating system provider identifies the presence of a vubierabihty in the released operating system. For example, in one scenario, the operating system provider, performing its own internal analysis of a released operating system, uncovers a previously unknown vulnerability that could be used to attack a computer system. In an alternative scenario, the previously unknown vxilnerability is discovered by third parties, including organizations that perform system security analyses on computer systems, and relays information regarding the vulnerability to the operating system provider.<br>
Once the operating system provider is aware of the presence of the security vuberability, the operating system provider addresses the vulnerability which, at event 204, leads to the creation and release of a patch to secure any computer systems running the operating system. Typically, an operating system provider will make some type of announcement that there is a system patch available, along with a recommendation to all operating system users to install the patch. The patch is usually placed in a known location on the network 110 for downloading and installation onto affected computer systems.<br>
Unfortunately, as happens all too often, after the operating system provider releases the patch, at event 206, a malicious party downloads the patch and, using some reverse engineering as well as any information made public by the operating system or others, identifies the specifics regarding the "fixed" vulnerability in the operating system. Using this information, the malicious party creates a computer exploit to attack the xmderlying vulnerability. At event 208, the malicious party releases the computer exploit onto the network 110. While the goal of issuing a software patch, also known as a "fix," is to correct an underlying vulnerability, the "fix" is often a complex piece of software code which itself, unfortunately, may create or contain a new vulnerability that could be attacked by a computer exploit created by a malicious party. Tlius, in addition to evaluating what the "fix" corrects, the "fix" is also evaluated for potential vulnerabilities.<br>
While a "fix" is available, the malicious party realizes that, for various reasons including those described above, not every vulnerable computer system will be immediately upgraded. Thus, at event 208, the malicious party releases the computer exploit 112 onto the network 110. The release of the computer exploit 112 opens a vulnerability window 212, as described above, in which the vulnerable computer systems are susceptible to this computer exploit. Only when the patch is fmally installed on a computer system, at event 210, is the vulnerability window 212 closed for that computer system.<br>
While many computer exploits released today are based on known vulnerabilities, such as in the scenario described in regard to FIGURE 2A, occasionally, a computer exploit is released on the network 110 that takes advantage of a previously unknown vulnerability. FIGURE 2B illustrates a vulnerability window 230 with regard to a timeline 220 under this scenario. Thus, as shown on timeline 220, at event 222, a malicious party releases a new computer exploit. As this is a new computer exploit, there is neither an operating system patch nor an anti-virus update available to protect vulnerable computer systems from the attack. Correspondingly, the vulnerability window 230 is opened.<br>
At some point after the new computer exploit is circulating on the network 110, the operating system provider and/or the anti-virus software provider detects the new computer exploit, as indicated by event 224. As those skilled in the art will appreciate, typically, the<br>
presence of the new computer exploit is detected within a matter of hours by both the operating system provider and the anti-virus software provider.<br>
Once the computer exploit is detected, the anti-virus software provider can begin its process to identify a pattern, or "signature," by which the anti-virus software may recognize the computer exploit. Similarly, the operating system provider begins its process to analyze the computer exploit to determine whether the operating system must be patched to protect it from the computer exploit. As a result of these parallel efforts, at event 226, the operating system provider and/or the anti-virus software provider releases an update, i.e., a software patch to the operating system or an anti-virus update, which addresses the computer exploit. Subsequently, at event 228, the update is installed on a user's computer system, thereby protecting the computer system and bringing the vulnerability window 230 to a close.<br>
As can be seen from the examples above, which are only representative of all of the possible scenarios in which computer exploits pose security threats to a computer system, a vulnerability window exists between the times that a computer exploit 112 is released on a network 110, and when a corresponding update is installed on a user's computer system to close the vulnerability window. Sadly, whether the vulnerability window is large or small, an infected computer costs the computer's owner substantial amounts of money to "disinfect" and repair, if it is at all possible. This cost can be enormous when dealing with large corporations or entities that may have thousands or hundreds of thousands of devices attached to a network 110. Such a cost is further amplified by the possibility that such an exploit tamper or destroys customer data, all of which may be extremely difficult or impossible to trace and remedy. What is needed is a system and method for securing a computer system against computer exploits in a responsive manner and according to the individual computer system's needs, even before a protective update is available and/or installed on the computer system. These, and other issues found in the prior art, are addressed by the present invention.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT FIGURE 3A is a pictorial diagram illustrating an exemplary networked environment 300 suitable for implementing aspects of the present uivention. The exemplary networked environment 300 includes a computer 302 connected to a network 110. It should be noted that while the present invention is generally described in terms of operatmg in conjunction with a personal computer, such as computer 302, it is for illustration purposes only, and should not be construed as limiting upon the present invention. Those skilled in the art will readily recognize that almost any networked computing device may be attacked by a computer exploit. Accordingly, the present invention may be advantageously implemented to protect numerous types of computers, computing devices, or computing systems including, but not limited to, personal computers, tablet computers, notebook computers, personal digital assistants (PDAs), mini- and mainframe computers, wireless phones (frequently referred to as cell phones), hybrid computing devices such as wireless phone/PDA combinations, and the like. The present invention may also be advantageously implemented to protect hardware devices, peripheral devices, software applications, device drivers, operating systems, and the like.<br>
It should be appreciated that the network 110 may include any number of actual communication networks. These actual commimication networks include, but are not limited to, the Internet, wide and local area networks, intranets, cellular networks, IEEE 802.11 and Bluetooth wireless networks, and the like. Accordingly, while the present invention is discussed m terms of a computer network, and in particular the Internet, it is for illustration purposes only, and should not be construed as limiting upon the present invention.<br>
The exemplary networked environment 300 also includes a network security module 304 and a security service 306. The network security module 304 is interposed between a computer, such as computer 302, and the network 110. The network security module 304 may be interposed between the computer 302 and the network 110 either physically or logically.   Communications between the computer 302 and the network 110<br>
flow through the network security module 304. According to the present invention, the network security module 304 selectively controls the network activities between the computer 302 and the network 110 according to security information corresponding to the computer's specific configuration, including, but not limited to, the particular operating system revision installed on the computer 302, anti-virus information, including revision information for both the anti-virus software and corresponding signature data files, installed applications, device drivers, and the like, all of which may be a potential target of a computer exploit to take advantage of a computer system vulnerability.<br>
According to one embodiment of the present invention, in order to periodically obtain security information from the security service 306, the network security module 304 periodically issues a security information request to the security service 306 for security information corresponding to the particular, specific configuration of the computer 302. The network security module 304 may be configured to periodically obtain the security information from the security service 306. For example, the network security module 304 may be configured to obtain security information from the security service 306 every minute. Alternatively, the network security module 304 may be configured to obtain security information from the security service 306 according to a user specified period of time.<br>
Obtaining security information corresponding to a computer's particular, specific configuration is important as many users must delay updating their computer systems for a myriad of reasons. For example, a delay in updating an operating system or anti-virus software may occur because a computer has been inactive for a while. Thus, while the most recent revision of operating system and/or anti-virus software may provide adequate protection from a newly discovered computer exploit, a computer may not be "up to date", and thus, susceptible to the computer exploit and must implement security measures that corresponds with the computer's particular configuration. Accordingly, the security information request may include, but is not limited to, information identifying the computer's operating system revision, including installed patches; the particular anti-virus software and revision used by the computer, as well as software and data file updates; and network-enabled application information, such as e-mail or browser identifiers, revisions, firmware providers and versions, and other security settings.<br>
According to aspects of the present invention, the network security module 304 obtains the computer's particular configuration information as one of the acts of updating a computer system component. For example, when a user installs an operating system patch on the computer 302, as one of the acts of installing the operating system patch, the network security module 304 is notified of the now current revision of the operating system. Similarly, other computer system features, such as a network-enabled application or anti-virus software, notify the network security module 304 as they are updated, all so that the network security module may obtain the most accurate and sufficient security information to protect the computer 302 according to the computer's specific current configuration.<br>
Based on the computer's particular configuration information in the security information request, the security service 306 identifies relevant security information to protect the computer from known or perceived computer system vulnerabilities. Identifying relevant security information is described in greater detail below. The security information includes protective security measures, to be implemented by the network security module 304, that enable the network security module to insulate the computer 302 from computer exploits of known vulnerabilities. Protective security measures may include any number of network activity controls, or combinations thereof, including, but not limited to: blocking all network activities between the computer 302 and the network 110, except communications between certain known, secure network locations, such as the security service 306 or the anti-virus software service 308 for installing patches or updates; blocking network traffic on specific communication ports and addresses; blocking communications to and/or from certain network-related applications, such as an e-mail or Web browser application; and blocking access to particular hardware or software components on the computer 302. Thus, upon receiving the security response, the network security module implements the security measures.<br>
As mentioned above, the network security module 304 is interposed between the computer 302 and the network 110 and, as such, all network activities between the computer and the network must flow through the network security module. As network traffic flows through the network security module 304, the network security module monitors the network<br>
traffic and implements the protective security measures received from the security service 306, such as blocking all network access except communications between known, secure locations, and the like.<br>
According to further aspects of the present invention, a security response may also include a designated security level, such as levels red, yellow, and green. The security levels represent information that identifies, to the computer's 302 user, a representative level of protective measures implemented by the network security module 304. For example, a security level of red may indicate that the network security module 304 is currently blocking all network activities between the computer 302 and the network 110 except access to and from known, secure locations. Alternatively, a security level of yellow may indicate that the network security module 304 is currently implementing some protective security measures, yet the computer 302 may still otherwise communicate with the network 110. Still fiirther, a security level of green may indicate that the network security module 304 is not implementing any protective security measures, and communications between the computer 302 and the network 110 are unrestricted. In accordance with the above described security levels, and for description purposes, a security level of red may also be referred to as full lock-down, a security level of yellow may also be referred to as partial lock-down, and a security level of green may also be referred to as free network access. While the above description identifies three security levels and a schema of red, yellow, and green, they are illustrative, and should not be construed as limiting upon the present invention. Those skilled in the art will readily recognize that any number of security levels may be implemented with alternative schemas for their representation to a user.<br>
As the network security module 304 operates in an autonomic manner, i.e., requiring no user intervention, the above-identified security levels, as well as any corresponding visual representations of the security levels, are for user information purposes only. They may be used to provide the user with an indication of the level of restrictions that are implemented by the network security module 304. This visual indication may be especially usefiil when a user is trying to determine whether a network connection is malfunctioning, or that network activity is restricted due to current network security concerns.<br>
According to aspects of the present invention and as an added measure of security, when tlie network security module 304 is powered up, the network security module enters a default state. This default state corresponds to the highest level of security, i.e., full lock-down, such that network activities between the computer 302 and trusted network locations are permissible. Either as part of the power up, or as part of the periodic communication with the security service 306, the network security module 304 obtains up-to-date security information and, depending on that security information, may impose less restrictive security measures. Clearly, implementing a default state of full lock-dovm at the network security module 304 is beneficial to the computer 302 as a vulnerability could have been identified, or an exploit released on the network 110 during the time that the network security module was powered off<br>
In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, the network security module 304 does not request or access information from the computer 302. Instead, the network security module 304 operates on information transmitted to it from the computer 302 in connection with certain events. Thus, when a network security module 304 first commences to protect a computer, such as when a network security module is first interposed between a computer 302 and the network 110, the network security module will not have any specific configuration information corresponding to the computer system. As mentioned above, when the network security module 304 has no configuration information regarding the computer 302, or when the network security module 304 is powered up, the network security module enters its default state, i.e., full lock-down. However, as mentioned above, full lock-down will still permit the computer 302 to communicate with known, secure locations. As an example, these knovm, secure locations include the location, or locations, where operating system updates are located. Thus, a user may run an update process that results in configuration mformation being sent to the network security module 304, even when the computer 302 is configured with the latest operating system, anti-virus software, application, and device driver revisions and updates that are available. Alternatively, a specific program may be provided that notifies the network security module 304 of the computer system's current configuration.<br>
In order to ensure that communications between the network security module 304 and the security service 306 are authentic and uncorrupted, in one embodiment of the present invention, communications between the network security module and the security service, such as security requests and security information, are delivered in encrypted, secured communications, such as secured communications using the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol. Similarly, communications between the network security module 304 and the computer 302 are also similarly secured.<br>
According to optional aspects of the present invention, the network security module 304 continues to operate, i.e., obtain security information corresponding to the computer 302, even when the computer is powered off For example, the network security module 304 may continue to obtain security information for the computer 302, all according to the latest operating system and/or anti-virus software revision data provided the computer when in was powered on. According to one embodiment, the network security module 304 is connected to the auxiliary power rail of a computer that, as is knovwi to those skilled in the art, provides power to peripheral devices even when the computer 302 is powered off. Additionally, if the network security module 304 operates only when the computer 302 is operating, when the network security module resumes operation, the network secxirity module implements a full lock-down while it obtains the most recent security information corresponding to the computer's current configuration.<br>
According to another embodiment of the present invention, the network security module 304 may be optionally disabled by a user. This is useful as there are certain times that the necessity of full access to a network outweighs the risk of an attack from a computer exploit. For example, it may be necessary to disable the network security module 304 when attempting to diagnose networking problems/issues. Alternatively, sorne emergency situations, such as using the E911 voice over IP (VoIP) service may necessitate that the network security module 304 be disabled.<br>
According to one aspect of the invention, when disabled, the network security module 304 continues to obtain security information from the security service 306, though it does not implement the protective security measures. Continually updating the security information is beneficial to the user, especially if the network security module 304 is only<br>
temporarily disabled, as the network security module will have the most recent security information when re-enabled. Alternatively, if the network security module 304 is disabled and not continually updating, after a predetermined period of no communication with the security service 306, the network security module may revert to its default condition, i.e., a foil lock-down of network activity.<br>
The security service 306 may be implemented as a single server/source for all security information, or alternatively, as a hierarchy of servers/sources distributed throughout the network 110. In a hierarchical system, a network security module 304 is initially configured with a root server/service in security service, one that will always be present. However, as part of the security information returned by the security service, perhaps in the first communication between the network security module 304 and the security service, the security service provides information regarding the hierarchy of the security service. This information may be provided as one or more ranges of network addresses, all of which are nodes in the security service hierarchy and that are able to provide the network security module 304 the appropriate security information. Thereafter, the network security module 304 need not necessarily query the original node to obtain information. Obviously, one advantage of implementing the security service in a hierarchical manner is that the security service may be easily scaled up or down in order to accommodate the number of network security module requesting information, and the original node in the security service hierarchy will not be overwhelmed by security information requests from all network security modules in a network. Under a hierarchical structure distributed in the network 110, load balancing may also occur and redundancy may be built into the system such that if one node in the hierarchy fails, others may step in and provide the security information.<br>
According to aspects of the present invention, the network security module 304 is transparent to the computer 302 and to the network 110, using a technique known in the art as port mimicking. Generally speaking, using port mimicking, the network security module 304 appears as the network 110 to the computer 302, and appears as the computer to devices on the network. Thus, network activity freely flows between the computer 302 and the network 110 through the network security module 304, unless the network security module determines that the communication is directed to the network security module, such<br>
as notification of an operating system update or a security information response, or unless the network security module must block the network activity according to the protective security measures.<br>
As described above, the network security module 304 obtains security information from the security service 306 as a result of a query. Those skilled in the art will recognize this as a poll system, i.e., polling the security service 306 for the security information. However, in an alternative embodiment, the security service 306 advantageously broadcasts important security information to the network security modules in the network 110. For example, depending on the periodic intervals at which the network security modules in the networked environment 300 obtain security information from the security service 306, if a particularly virulent computer exploit begins to circulate the network 110, rather than wait for network security modules to request important security information, the security service broadcasts security information to the network security modules. This security information, referred to hereafter as a security bulletin, will typically include all configurations that are susceptible to the computer exploit, protective security measures to be taken, as well as indicating the corresponding security level. According to one embodiment of the present invention, the security bulletins are XML documents, organized according to a predetermined schema.<br>
A system that broadcasts information to listeners is referred to as a push system, i.e., the security service 306 pushes important security information to the network security modules. According to aspects of the present invention, security bulletins are broadcast over the network 110 using a "guaranteed delivery" service. In a guaranteed delivery service, security bulletins are identified as high priority items, and in agreement with the network service providers, are delivered before the delivery of other network traffic that would otherwise be delivered first.<br>
In addition to delivering the security bulletins over the same network 110 upon which the computer 302 communicates, there are many times that it would be advantageous to communicate "out of band," i.e., over a second communication link separate from the network 110. FIGURE 3B is a pictorial diagram illustrating an alternatively configured networked environment 310 for implementing aspects of the present invention, including a<br>
second communication link 314 for delivering security information to the network security modules attached to the network 110.<br>
As shown in FIGURE 3B, the alternatively configured networked environment 310 includes similar components as those described above in regard to the networked environment 300, including the computer 302, the security service 306, and the network security module 304. However, the security service 306 is additionally configured to transmit security information, including both security information and/or security bulletins, to a network security module 304 specifically adapted with a receiving device 312 to receive the information over the second communication link 314. According to aspects of the present invention, the second communication link 314 may be a satellite communication link, a radio frequency broadcast, or some other form of secondary communication between the security service 306 and the network security module 304. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that any number of communication channels may be used.<br>
According to alternative aspects of the invention, the second communication link 314 may be a one-way communication link from the security service 306 and the network security module 304, or a two-way communication link for communications between the security service and the security module. Additionally, software updates or patches, as mentioned above, may also be available for download over the second communication link 314 from the security service 306.<br>
While the network security module 304 is interposed between the computer 302 and the Internet 110, actual embodiments of a network security module may vary. In each case, the network security module 304 is treated as a trusted component by the computer 302. According to one embodiment, the network security module 304 is implemented as a hardware device, sometimes called a "dongle," external to the computer 302, with connections to the network 110 and to the computer. Alternatively, the network security module 304 may be implemented as a hardware component integrated within the computer 302, or as an integrated sub-component within the computer's network interface. Integrating the network security module 304 within the computer 302 or as a sub-component on the computer's network interface may be especially useful when the computer 302 is connected to the network 110 via a vwreless cormection.<br>
According to another alternative embodiment, the network security module may be implemented as logic, such as microcoding or firmware, within a component of the computer 302, including, but not limited to, the processor, graphics processing unit, north bridge, or south bridge. As yet a farther alternative embodiment, the network security module 304 may be implemented as a software module operating in conjunction with, or as part of, the operating system, or as a separate application installed on the computer 302. The software implemented network security module 304 may operate on a second processor in the computer 302. The second processor may or may not be implementing other computer system tasks asymmetrically with the computer's main processor. Accordingly, the network security module 304 should not be construed as limited to any particular embodiment.<br>
It should be pointed out that one of the benefits realized by the present invention is that the system mitigates the effects of many exploits. For example, those skilled in the art vwll recognize that a denial of service (DOS) attack is an attempt to overwhelm a computer with network requests, to the end that the computer exhausts its resources and crashes, or alternatively, erroneously enters an ambiguous state that is more vulnerable to external attacks/exploits. However, with a network security module 304 responding to a security service 306 by implementing protective security measures, such exploits, including the potentially overwhehning network requests, never reach the computer 302.<br>
In order to more fiilly understand how the above-described components operate to provide enhanced security to the computer 302, reference is made to exemplary scenarios, illustrated on timelines with corresponding events. FIGURES 4A and 4B are block diagrams illustrating exemplary timelines for demonstrating the operation of the com.ponents of the present invention. More particularly, FIGURE 4A is a block diagram illustrating an exemplary timeline 400 for demonstrating how the present invention minimizes the vulnerability window 406 of a computer 302 with regard to the release of a new computer exploit on the network 110. It should be noted that while the following is presented as a computer exploit attacking an operating system, it is for illustration purposes, and should not be construed as limiting upon the present invention. The present invention may be utilized to protect code modules, services, even hardware devices on a computer system.<br>
As shown on the timeline 400, at event 402, a malicious party releases a new computer exploit onto the network 110. The release of the new computer exploit commences the vulnerability window 406 for computers connected to the network 110 targeted by the new computer exploit, such as computer 302. At event 404, the presence of the new computer exploit is detected, either by the operating system provider, the anti-virus provider, or others, as described above.<br>
Upon detecting the presence of the new computer exploit, even before the nature or mode of attack of the exploit is identified, at event 408, the operating system provider, publishes security information via the security service 306. Typically, when a computer exploit is discovered, and its nature, extent, or mode of attack is not well known, the security service will set the security level for all apparently affected computer systems at red, i.e., full lock-down. At block 410, the network security module 304 obtains the security information, either in its periodic request or as a security bulletin, and implements the corresponding security measures, in this case, full lock-down. Beneficially, upon implementing the security measures from the security service 306, the vulnerability window 406 of targeted computers is closed.<br>
In contrast to the vulnerability window 230 of FIGURE 2B, vulnerability vwndow 406 is relatively small, thereby minimizing the exposure of targeted computer systems to the new computer exploit. Clearly, the actual length of time that a vulnerability window is open, such as vulnerability window 406, depends upon a small number of factors. One factor is the amount of time that passes before the computer exploit is detected. As discussed above, a new computer exploit is typically detected within fifteen minutes to a few hours from release. A second factor, much more variable than the first, is the amount of time it takes for the network security module 304 to obtain security information firom the security service 306. Assuming that the network security module 304 may continually obtain security information, it may take mere seconds to obtain the security information and implement the corresponding security measures. However, if the network security module 304 cannot continually communicate with the security service 306, or if the periodic time fi-ame for obtaining the security information is long, implementing the protective security measures may take a very long time.   According to aspects of the present invention, if the network<br>
security module 304 is out of contact with the security service 306 for a predetermined amount of time, the network security module defaults to a frill lock-down status, pending future communication from the security service.<br>
After the initial security information is published, the operating system provider or anti-virus software provider will typically continue analyzing the computer exploit in order to better understand how it operates, and/or what specific computer system features it attacks. From this analysis, a second, perhaps less restrictive, set of protective measures is identified that vulnerable computer systems must take to prevent the computer exploit from infecting them. Accordmgly, at event 412, updated security information is published with a security level of yellow and identifying protective measures to block at-risk network activities, i.e., partial lock-down. For example, as described above, the protective security measures may include simply blocking access to and from a specific range of communication ports, including the source and/or destination ports, or disabling e-mail communications, Web access, or other network activities directed to the operating system, applications, device drivers, and the like, installed on a protected computer system, while permitting other network activities to flow freely. It should be understood that "at-risk" network activities include network activities that represent a threat to a computing system by an exploit, whether or not the exploit attacks computer system flaws or simply abuses legitimate computer system features. Additionally, the "at-risk" network activities include network activities directed to a computer system that are unilaterally initiated by another device. In other words, "at-risk" network activities includes the network activities of exploits directed at a computer system that has done nothing more that connect to the network.<br>
At event 414, the updated security information is obtained by the network security module 304, and the corresponding protective security measures are implemented. At event 416, after the operating system provider and/or anti-virus provider has generated and made available a software update, additional updated security information is published. This additional updated security information may identify that the security level is green, provided that a software update, such as an update from the operating system provider, the anti-virus software provider, or application provider, is installed on the computer 302. Subsequently, at event 418, the additional updated security information is obtained, the software updates are<br>
installed on the computer 302, and the network security module 304 enables free, i.e., unrestricted, network access.<br>
FIGURE 4B is a block diagram illustrating an alternative exemplary timeline 420 for demonstrating how the present invention eliminates the vulnerability vnndow that may exist with regard to the release of a computer exploit on the network 110, more particularly, an exploit that takes advantage of a previously identified vulnerability rather than an entirely new attack. As mentioned, the use of a previously known vulnerability is much more commonplace than entirely new attacks. At event 422, the operating system provider identifies the presence of a vulnerability in the current release of the operating system. In response to the threat posed by the identified vutoerability, at event 424, the operating system provider publishes mitigating security information, setting the security level and identiiying corresponding protective security measures. In the present example shovra in FIGURE 4B, assuming that the vulnerability poses a substantial risk to the computers connected to the network 110, the operating system provider publishes security information setting the security level to red with security measures to implement a full lock-down. At event 426, the network security module 304 obtains the latest security information and implements the full lock-down. It should be noted that security measures are implemented that protect the computer 302 from the identified vulnerability before a patch or "fix" is available. As the majority of computer exploits are somehow derived from information gained by analyzing the vulnerabilities that a patch corrects, a malicious party is proactively denied the opportunity to create an exploit to attack the vulnerability. Thus, no vulnerability window is opened. Obviously, this result is a substantial benefit to the computer user, especially in contrast to the corresponding time line 200 illustrated in FIGURE 2A when the network security module is not implementing the security measures.<br>
Frequently, after further analysis of the computer exploit, an operating system provider may determine a less restrictive set of protective measures that will protect the computers connected to the network from the computer exploit. Thus, as shown in FIGURE 4B, at event 428, an updated security bulletin is published, setting the security level at yellow and including corresponding protective security measures, i.e., partial lock-down, that specifically address the exploited vulnerability, while enablmg all other network<br>
activities.   Correspondingly, at event 430, the updated security information is obtained and the network security module 304 implements the partial lock-down.<br>
Once an operating system patch or anti-virus update is available which, if installed on a computer 302, would protect it from a computer exploit targeting the vulnerability, at event 432, the operating system provider publishes the information, and indicates that once installed, the network security modules may permit free network access, i.e., setting the security level to green once the patch is installed. Correspondingly, at event 434, after the patch or anti-virus update is installed on the computer 302, the network security module 304 enables free access.<br>
FIGURE 5 is a flow diagram illustrating an exemplary routme 500 for dynamically controlling a computer's network access according to published security information. FIGURE 5 includes two starting terminals, starting terminal 502 corresponding to the startup of a network security module 304, and starting terminal 520 corresponding to receiving an update notice from the computer system 302. Beginning first at starting terminal 502 and proceeding to block 504, the network security module 304 implements fiill lock-down related security measures. As described above, when in full lock-down, the computer is limited to accessing known, trusted network locations, including the security service 306, in order to obtain the latest security status information and any available updates.<br>
At block 506, the network security module 304 obtains the latest security information from the security service 306 corresponding to the computer's current configuration. According to aspects of the present invention, the network security module 304 may obtain the latest security information from the security service by issuing a request to the security service for that information. Alternatively, the network security module 304 may obtain the latest security information as a broadcast from the security service 306, either over a second communication link or as a broadcast over the network.<br>
At decision block 508, based on the latest security information obtained from the security service 306, the network security module 304 determines whether the currently implemented security measures, and corresponding security level, are up to date with the obtained security information. According to one aspect of the present invention, this determination is made as a simple comparison of revision information for the computer<br>
system that the network security module currently has stored against what the security service publishes as the latest revisions.<br>
If the currently implemented security measures are not up to date, at block 510, the network security module 304 obtains security measures for the computer system according to information that the network security module has stored regarding the computer system. Alternatively (not shown), the security measures may be included wdth the obtained security information. Once the network security module 304 has the security measures, at block 512, the network security module implements the security measures and sets the corresponding sectirity level, e.g., red, yellow, or green.<br>
After implementing the security measures for the computer system, or alternatively, if the currently implemented security measures are up to date for the computer system, at block 514, the network security module 304 enters a delay state. This delay state corresponds to the time period for which the network security module 304 periodically queries the security service 306 to obtain the latest security information. After delaying for the predetermined amotmt of time, the process returns to block 506, where the process of obtaining the latest security information from the security service 306, determining if the currently implemented security measures are up to date for the computer system, and implementing any new security measures, is repeated.<br>
As shown in FIGURE 5, the exemplary routine 500 does not have an ending terminal as it is designed to operate continuously to protect the computer 302 from computer exploits. However, those skilled in the art will recognize that the routine 500 will terminate if the network security module 304 is powered off, disconnected from the exemplary networked environment 300, or explicitly disabled by a user, as described above.<br>
With reference to the alternative starting terminal 520, this entry point represents the situation when the network security module 304 receives update notices from the computer system. As previously discussed, applications adapted to take advantage of the present invention will, as one of the steps to update the computer system, notify the network security module of now current revision information. For example, while updating the anti-virus software, one step of the process would be to issue a notice, intended for the network security<br>
module 304, advising the network security module of the now current revision.   Thus, at block 522, the network security module receives an update notice.<br>
At block 524, the update notice information is stored by the network security module for later use in determining whether the currently implemented security measures are up to date. Operating system updates, as well as other code module updates, may also be adapted to provide notice to the network security module 304 so that the security system may make more informed decisions as to the appropriate security measures necessary to protect any given computer system.<br>
After storing the information, the routine 500 proceeds to block 506 where the steps of obtaining the latest security information from the security service 306, determining if the currently implemented security measures are up to date for the computer system, and implementing any new security measures is begun, as described above. As an alternative (not shown), after receiving updated computer system information at block 524, the network seciuity module may wait to obtain security status information until a current delay state is finished.<br>
FIGURE 6 is a flow diagram illustrating an exemplary routine 600 for broadcasting security information for network security modules, such as network security module 304, in the exemplary networked environment 300. Begirming at block 602, the security service 306 obtains security related information from a variety of sources. For example, the security service 306 would typically obtain information from operating system providers, anti-virus software providers regarding the latest revisions, patches, and updates available, as well as the computer exploits and/or vulnerabilities that are addressed via the various patches and updates. Other sources may also be polled for security related information, including various government agencies, security specialists, and the like.<br>
At block 604, the security service 306 obtains information regarding a vulnerabilit)' of the computer systems connected to the network 110. This information may come fi'om an operating system provider, an anti-virus software provider, or other party as the vulnerability is detected. At block 606, the security service 306, based on the threat posed by the vulnerability, determines a security level, e.g., red, yellow, or green, as well as protective security measures to be implemented by the network security modules, such as network<br>
security module 304, to secure the affected computers from an attack by a computer exploit on the vulnerability.<br>
At block 606, the security service 306 broadcasts a security bulletin, comprising the security level and corresponding protective security measures, to the network security modules attached to the network 110, as described above. As discussed above, the security service 306 may broadcast the security bulletin by issuing a network-wide broadcast to all network security modules. This network-wide broadcast may be over the network 110, optionally using the guaranteed delivery option described above, or over a second commimication link 314 to the network security devices in the networked environment 300. After broadcasting the security bdletin, the routine 600 terminates.<br>
FIGURE 7 is a flow diagram illustrating an exemplary routine 700 implemented by a security service 306 to receive and respond to a security information request from a network security module 304. Beginning at block 702, the security service 306 receives a security information request from a network security device 304. As already mentioned, the security information request may include information corresponding to the computer's current configuration.<br>
At block 704, according to the particular computer's configuration information in the security information request provided by the network security module, the security service 306 identifies relevant security information corresponding to the computer's current configuration information in the security information request.<br>
According to one embodiment, the security service 306 identifies the relevant security information by determining protective security measures needed to protect the computer 302 according to the computer's configuration information. According to an alternative embodiment, the security service 306 identifies the relevant security information by returning all security information corresponding to the particular computer's configuration for fiirther processing by the network security module to determine which protective security measures should be implemented. As yet a fiirther alternative, the security service 306 identifies the relevant security information by returning all security information corresponding to the particular computer's configuration which is then forwarded to the computer 302 from the network security device such that the computer can inform the<br>
network security module which protective security measures to implement. Combinations of the above described alternatives may also be utilized, as well as other systems. Accordingly, the present invention should not be construed as limited to any one particular embodiment.<br>
At block 706, the security service 306 returns the relevant security information to the requesting network security module 304. Thereafter, the routine 700 terminates.<br>
FIGURE 8 is a flow diagram illustrating an exemplary method 800 implemented by a network security module 304, for controlling the flow of network traffic between a computer 302 and the network according to sectirity measures obtained from the security service 306. Beginning at block 802, the network security module 304 receives network traffic, including both network traffic coming to the computer 302, as well as network traffic originating with the computer.<br>
At decision block 804, a determination is made as to whether the netv/ork traffic is to or from a trusted network site, such as the security service, an anti-virus software provider, an operating system provider, and the like. If the network traffic is to or from a trusted network site, the routine proceeds to block 810 where the network traffic is permitted to flow through the network security module 304, and the routine 800 subsequently terminates. However, if the network traffic is not to or from a trusted network site, the routine proceeds to decision block 806.<br>
At decision block 806, another determination is made as to whether the network traffic is restricted according to the currently implemented security measures. If the network traffic is not restricted according to the currently implemented security measures, the routine proceeds to block 810, where the network traffic is permitted to flow through the network security module 304, and the routine 800 subsequently terminates. However, if the network traffic is restricted according to the currently implemented security measures, the routine proceeds to block 808, where the network traffic is not permitted to flow through the network security module 304. Thereafter, the routine 800 terminates.<br>
While the network security module 304 is interposed between the computer 302 and the Internet 110, the actual embodiment of the network security module may vary. According to one embodiment, the network security module 304 may be implemented as a hardware  device,  physically   external   to  the   computer 302,   with   connections   to  the<br>
LntemetllO and to the computer 302. FIGURE 9 is a pictorial diagram illustrating an exemplary network security module 304 implemented as a hardware device external to the computer 302.<br>
As shown in FIGURE 9, as an external device, the network security module 304 includes a cormection 902 to the network 110 and a corresponding connection 904 to the computer 302. All network activity between the computer 302 and the network 110 is carried on the connection 904 to the computer. The illustrated network security module 304 also includes a secondary computer cormection 918 between the computer 302 and the network security module for communicating information between the two. The illustrated network security module 304 further includes an enable/disable switch 906, status indicators 910-916, and an optional connection 908 to an external power source.<br>
As previously mentioned, it may be desirable to disable the network security module 304 from enforcing its current security measures. According to the illustrated embodiment of FIGURE 9, the enable/disable switch 906 is a toggle switch to disable the network security module 304 when it is desirable to bypass the current security measiires, and also to enable the network security module 304 such that it enforces the current security measures it has obtained from the security service 306.<br>
Status indicators 910-916 are included to provide a visual indication of the network security module's current status. Status indicators, as previously discusses, are for informational purposes only. They provide optional visual clues to the computer user as to the protective security measures implemented by the network security module 304. Each indicator corresponds to a particular seciuity status. For example, status indicator 910 may correspond to a security level of red, meaning a total lock-down of network activities, and is illuminated in red when the network security module 304 is implementing a total lock-down. Status indicator 912 may correspond to a security level of yellow, i.e., a partial lock-down of network activities, and be illuminated in yellow when the network security module 304 is implementing the partial lock-down. Similarly, status indicator 914 may correspond to the security level green, i.e., free network access, and is illuminated in green when the network security module 304 is permitting unrestricted network access. Status indicator 916 may correspond to the enabled/disabled status of the network security module 304, such that the<br>
status indicator is illuminated, perhaps as with a flashing red light, when the network security module is disabled.<br>
While the present invention may be implemented as illustrated in FIGURE 9, it should be viewed as illustrative only. Numerous modifications and alterations may be made to the physical embodiment illustrated in FIGURE 9 without departing from the scope of the present invention. Accordingly, the present invention should not be construed as limited to any particular physical embodiment.<br>
As an alternative to a physical embodiment (not shown), the network security module 304 may be a component integrated as a component within the computer 302, or as a sub-component within the computer's network interface. These two embodiments may be especially usefiil when the computer 302 is connected to the Internet 110 via a wireless connection. As yet a further alternative embodiment, the network security module 304 may be implemented as a software module integrated within the operating system, or as a separate module iastalled on the computer 302. Accordingly, the network security module 304 should not be construed as limited to any particular embodiment, physical or logical.<br>
FIGURE 10 is a block diagram illustrating exemplary logical components of a network security module 304, formed in accordance with the present invention. The network security module 304 includes a memory 1002, security status indicator module 1004, a comparison module 1006, a security enforcement module 1008, an update request module 1010, a network connection 1012, a computer connection 1014, a secondary computer coimection 1018, and a coder/decoder module 1020.<br>
The memory 1002, including volatile and non-volatile memory areas, stores the current security measures to be implemented by the network security module 304. The memory 1002 also stores the configuration information provided to the network security module 304, including current revision information of the operating system, anti-virus software and signatures, applications, and the like. Other information may also be stored in the memory 1002, including trusted location addresses, update sources, and the like. Information such as trusted location addresses, are likely stored in non-volatile memory.<br>
The security status indicator module 1004 is for representing to the computer user the network security module's 304 current security status.    For example, when the network<br>
security module 304 is implemented as a physical device, such as illustrated in FIGURE 9, the security status indicator module 1004 controls the status indicators 910-916 according to the network security modules current security status.<br>
The comparison module 1006 performs the comparisons between the security information stored in the memory 1002 and the security information obtained from the security service 306 to determine whether the security information stored in the memory 1002 is up to date for the computer's current configuration. The security enforcement module 1008 is that component that implements the security measures necessary to protect the computer 302 from perceived threats. TTius, the security enforcement module 1008 controls the flow of network activities between the computer 302 and the network 110 according to the security measures stored in the memory 1002.<br>
The update request module 1010 is used in a poll system to periodically request the latest security information from the security service 306. In a push system, the update request module 1010 may act as a receiver of security information from the security service and work in cooperation with the comparison module 1006 to identify protective security measures for sufficiently protecting the computer 302 according to the information received from the security service 306. Alternatively, the update request module may communicate with the computer 302 to determine/identify the protective security measures for sufficiently protecting the computer according to the information received from the security service 306. All of the components of the network seciuity module 304 are inter-connected via a common system bus 1016.<br>
The coder/decoder module 1020 is used to encode and decode secured communications between the network security module 304 and the security service 306, as well as secured communications between the computer 302 and the network security module. Information decoded by the coder/decoder module 1020 is provided to the security enforcement module 1008 for implementing current security measures.<br>
According to one embodiment, the secured communications between the computer 302 and the network security module 304 are delivered via the secondary computer connection 1018. However, the present invention should not be construed as limited to comprising a secondary computer connection 1018.    In an alternative embodiment, the<br>
network security module 304 commum'cates with the computer 302 using just the principal computer cormection 1014.<br>
While individual components of a network security module 304 have been described, it should be understood that they are logical components, and may be combined together, or with other components not described, in an actual embodiment. Accordingly, the above-described components should be viewed as illustrative, and not construed as limiting upon the present invention.<br>
While the network security module 304 as described, operating alone or in conjunction with anti-virus software, is able to protect a computing device from many computer exploits/attacks, in some situations, certain directed exploits may be able to bypass the network security module and/or the anti-virus software. In particular, one technique used by malicious parties to attack a computing device is to insulate the exploit from detection by using secured communications between an infected computer/exploit origin and the targeted computing device. FIGURE 11 is a block diagram illustrating how computer exploits may be delivered to a computing device using secured communications.<br>
As an example of how computer exploits may be delivered to a computing device using secured communications, and with reference to FIGURE 11, a malicious party on computer 102 has an exploit 112. In order to infect another computer, such as computer 1104, the malicious party may offer the exploit 112 as a legitimate resoiirce/content to others, but offers to deliver it via secured communications. As is known to those skilled in the art, secured communications are encrypted, typically with public and private cryptographic keys, such that only the possessor of a decryption key (the private key) is able to decrypt and view the content of the secured communications. Examples of secured commimication protocols include Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols.<br>
Continuing with the present example, an unsuspecting user, via computing device 1104, is duped into believmg that the exploit 112 is indeed legitimate content and requests the exploit from the computer 102. The computer 102 and computing device 1104 negotiate and exchange cryptographic keys for encrypting and decrypting the exploit 112. Thereafter, a transmission encoder 1106 encodes the exploit for delivery, and securely<br>
delivers the encrypted exploit to the computing device 1104 through the network 110, as indicated by arrow 1108. Because the exploit 122 is delivered in an encrypted state, it is very likely that it can pass a network security module 304 (not shown) and any anti-virus software. Upon reaching the computing device 1104, a transmission decoder module 1110 decodes/decrypts the secured communication and it is presented to the browser display module 1112. Those skilled in the art will recognize that frequently, the transmission decoder module 1110 is an integral part of the browser display module 1112. The browser display module 1112, upon displaying the exploit, enables the exploit 112 to infect the computing device 1104.<br>
In accordance with aspects of the present invention, the network security module 304 may be used to protect a computing device from a computer exploit delivered via secured communications. With reference again to FIGURE 10, the network security module 304 obtains the cryptographic key necessary to decrypt the secured communication from the computing device via the secondary computer connection 1018. Once the cryptographic key is obtained, the coder/decoder module 1020 temporarily decodes the secured communication for processing. As will be described in greater detail below, if the secured communication is found to violate the security measures implemented by the network security module 304, or to be an exploit, the secured communication is prohibited from reaching the computing device 1104. However, if the secured commimication is not in violation of the implemented security measures, and is not an exploit, the secured communication is permitted to flow to the computing device 1104.<br>
According to aspects of the present invention, the secondary computer connection 1018 (FIGURE 10) may be one of a variety of communication channels to the computing device 1104. For example, the secondary computer connection 1018 may be a Universal Serial Bus (USB) connection, an IEEE 1394 connection, or a standard serial or parallel data connection. As described above, one of the purposes of the secondary computer connection 1018 is to provide a communication channel through which the network security module 304 may obtain a cryptographic decryption key from the transmission decoder 1110 to temporarily decrypt the secured communication. Accordingly, as an alternative embodiment,   the   secondary   computer  connection 1018   may   also   be   the   computer<br>
connection 1014 on which network activity between the computing device and the network 110 is carried. According to this alternative embodiment, the distinction between the computer connection 1014 and the secondary computer connection 1018 is a logical, not physical, distinction.<br>
FIGURE 12 is a block diagram of an exemplary environment 1200 illustrating how a network security module 304, adapted according to aspects of the present invention, is able to protect a computing device 1104 from a computer exploit 112 delivered to the computing device via a secured communication. Similar to the example of FIGURE 11, the malicious party on computer 102 attempts to deliver the computer exploit 112 to the computing device 1104 via secured communications, as indicated by arrow 1108. However, a network security module 304, interposed between the network 110 and the computing device 1104, first obtains the secured communication. As part of enforcing the security measures associated with the current security level, or simply as an ongoing security precaution, the network security module 304 evaluates incoming network activity to determine whether any of the communications are secured communications.<br>
Upon detecting a secured communication, the network security module 304 requests the cryptographic decoding key from the transmission decoder module 1110 on the computing device 1102 over the secondary computer connection 1018, as indicated by arrow 1202. Using the cryptographic decoding key, the network security module 304 temporarily decrypts the secured communication and processes the decrypted communication data according to any security measures implemented by the network security module. According to additional aspects of the present invention, the network security module 304, operating in conjunction with anti-virus software, may also deliver the temporarily decrypted communication data to the anti-virus software for its evaluation as an exploit/virus.<br>
Upon detecting that the secured communication is either prohibited network activity according to the implemented security measures, or that it represents an exploit as detected by any anti-virus software, the network security module 304 prohibits the secured communication/exploit from reaching the computing device 1104, as indicated by arrow 1204.     In   this  manner,  the   computing  device 1104   is  protected,   even   from<br>
communications delivered over secure communication channels. Alternatively, if the secured communication is not in violation of any implemented security measures and is not an exploit, the secure commimication is relayed to the computing device 1104.<br>
While the above descriptions of FIGURES 11 and 12 illustrate that the transmission decoder 1110 is a separate module from the browser display module 1112, it is for illustration purposes only. Those skilled in the art will readily recognize that the transmission decoder 1110 is quite often an integral component of a browser display module 1112 found on a computing device.<br>
FIGURES 13A and 13B illustrate a block diagram of an exemplary routine 1300 for detecting and processing secured communications, in accordance with aspects of the present invention. It should be appreciated that while the exemplary routine 1300 may be implemented on a network security module 304, it may also be separately implemented and executed as a software module operating in conjunction with a browser display module 1112 to protect the computing device 1104 firom exploits 112.<br>
Beginning at block 1302 (FIGURE 13A), the exemplary routine 1300 monitors network activities, and in particular, incoming network activities. Upon detecting an incoming network activity, at decision block 1304, a determination is made as to whether the network activity is a secured communication directed to the protected computing device. If the network activity is not a secured communication directed to the protected computing device, at block 1306, the network activity is relayed to the protected computing device. Thereafter, the process returns to block 1302 for additional monitoring of network activity. While not shown, additional processing may occur on the unsecured network activity. For example, if the exemplary routine 1300 is implemented on a network security module, such as network security module 304, additional processing may occur, such as determining whether the network activity is in violation of any security measures implemented by the network security module. This processing of unsecured network activity has been described above.<br>
If the network activity is a secured communication, at block 1308, a decryption key for decrypting the secured communication is obtained. At block 1310, the secured communication is temporarily decrypted using the obtained decryption key.   Thereafter, at<br>
decision block 1312 (FIGURE 13B), a determination is made as to whether the decrypted communication is prohibited according to the security measures implemented by the network security module 304. If the commvmication represents prohibited network activity, at block 1314, the secured communication is disallowed, i.e., not forwarded to the computing device. Thereafter, the routine 1300 returns to block 1302 (FIGURE 13 A) to continue monitoring network activity.<br>
If the decrypted communication is not prohibited by the implemented security measures, at decision block 1316 an additional determination may be made as to whether the decrypted communication is an exploit. As mentioned above, the network security module 304 may operate in conjunction with external anti-virus software. In this environment, the network security module 304 delivers the temporarily decrypted communication to the anti-virus software for evaluation as to whether it is an exploit, or infected by an exploit. If the decryted communication is determined to be an exploit, at block 14314, the secured communication is disallowed, and the routine 1300 returns to block 14302 (FIGURE 13A) to continue monitoring network activity. Alternatively, if the decrypted communication is determined to not be an exploit, at block 1318, the secured communication is forwarded to the computing device. Thereafter, the routine 1300 returns to block 1302 (FIGURE 13A) to continue monitoring network activity.<br>
