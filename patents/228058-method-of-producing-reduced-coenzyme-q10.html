				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
METHOD OF PRODUCING REDUCED COENZYME Q10<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a method of producing<br>
a reduced coenzyme Q10. Reduced coenzyme Q10 shows a higher level<br>
of oral absorbability as compared with oxidized coenzyme Q10<br>
and is a compound useful as an ingredient in good foods, functional<br>
nutritive foods, specif ic health foods, nutritional supplements,<br>
nutrients, animal drugs, drinks, feeds, cosmetics, medicines,<br>
remedies, preventive drugs, etc.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
It is known that reduced coenzyme Q10 can be prepared by<br>
producing coenzyme Q10 in the conventional manner, for example<br>
by synthesis, fermentation, or extraction fromnatural products,<br>
and concentrating a reduced coenzyme Q10-containing eluate<br>
fraction resulting from chromatography (JP-A-10-109933). On<br>
that occasion, as described in the above-cited publication, the<br>
chromatographic concentrationmay be carried out after reduction<br>
of oxidized coenzyme Q10 contained in the reduced coenzyme Q10<br>
with a reducing agent such as sodium borohydride or sodium<br>
dithionite (sodium hyposulfite), or reduced coenzyme Q10 may<br>
be prepared by reacting the reducing agent mentioned above with<br>
an existing highly pure grade of coenzyme Q10.<br>
JP-A-57-70834 discloses an example in which reduced<br>
coenzyme Q10 was synthesized by dissolving coenzyme Q10 in hexane<br>
and adding an aqueous solution of sodium hydrosulfite (sodium<br>
hyposulfite) in an amount of twice the weight of coenzyme Q10<br>
to the solution, followed by stirring.<br>
However, the present inventors preliminary investigated<br>
the above reduction method, and found that it is not so easy<br>
to obtain a high-quality reduced coenzyme Q10 in a high yield.<br>
The above problem leads to not only economical<br>
disadvantageous but also to problems in qualities such as the<br><br>
immixture of oxidized coenzyme Q10, which is difficult to remove,<br>
into a product. Moreover, use of a large, amount of a reducing<br>
agent enhances the load for removal and detoxification of the<br>
reducing agent and components derived therefrom.<br>
Thus, the above disadvantages in the reduction reaction<br>
give rise to a necessity of another process for purification.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In view of the foregoing, the present invention has an<br>
object to provide a convenient and efficient synthesis method<br>
to obtain high-quality reduced coenzyme Q10.<br>
The present inventors made intensive investigations, and<br>
as a result, found that high-quality reduced coenzyme Q10 can<br>
be obtained at a high yield in a' convenient and efficient manner,<br>
by carrying out a reduction reaction under specific condition<br>
in a method of producing reduced coenzyme Q10 comprising reducing<br>
oxidized coenzyme Q10 with dithionous acid or a salt thereof.<br>
Based on this finding, the present inventors have completed the<br>
present invention.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention is a method of<br>
synthesizing a reduced coenzyme Q10<br>
which comprises reducing an oxidized coenzyme Q10 in an<br>
aqueous medium with the use of dithionous acid or a salt<br>
thereof,<br>
said reduction being carried out in the coexistence of<br>
a salt and/or under deoxygenated atmosphere, and at pH of 7 or<br>
below.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Hereafter, the present invention is described in detail.<br>
In the present invention, dithionous acid or a salt<br>
thereof is used as a reducing agent. The dithionous acid or a<br>
salt thereof is not particularly restricted but a salt form<br>
of dithionous acid is generally used. The salt of dithionous<br>
acid is not particularly restricted but includes,<br><br>
as preferred species, alkali metal salts, alkaline earth metal<br>
salts, ammonium salts and the like. Alkali metal salts such<br>
as a lithium salt, a sodium salt, and a potassium salt are more<br>
preferred, and a sodium salt is most preferred.<br>
The above reduction reaction is carried out in an aqueous<br>
medium. The amount of water to be used in the reduction reaction<br>
is not particularly restricted, but may be an amount of water<br>
such that an appropriate amount of the reducing agent, namely<br>
dithionous acid or a salt thereof, can be dissolved therein.<br>
In general, for example, it is advisable that the amount of<br>
the dithionous acid or a salt be adjusted usually to not<br>
more than 30 w/w%, and preferably not more than 20 w/wl, relative<br>
to the weight of water. From the productivity viewpoint, among<br>
others, it is advisable that the amount be adjusted generally<br>
to not less than 1 w/w%, preferably not less than 5 w/w%, and<br>
more preferably not less than 10 w/w%.<br>
The above reduction reaction is carried out in the<br>
coexistence of a salt and/or under deoxygenated atmosphere, and<br>
at pH of 7 or below. In other words, the above reduction reaction<br>
may be carried out under oxygen-containing atmosphere when under<br>
in the coexistence of a salt and at pH of 7 or below. Moreover,<br>
a condition with no existence of salts is allowable when the<br>
reduction is carried out under deoxygenated atmosphere and at<br>
pH of 7 or below. Furthermore, it is also possible to carry<br>
out the reduction in the existence of salt and under deoxygenated<br>
atmosphere, at pH of 7 or below.<br>
The above salt is not particularly restricted as long as<br>
the reduced coenzyme Q10 is not oxidized therewith. For example,<br>
there may be mentioned a salt constituted from an alkaline metal<br>
such as lithium, sodium and potassium, or alkaline earth metals<br>
such as magnesium and potassium, with a halogen atom such as<br>
fluorine, chloride and bromine, or a residue obtained by<br>
excluding a proton from an inorganic acid such as sulfuric acid<br>
or an organic acid such as formic acid, acetic acid and propionic<br>
acid. Among these, inorganic salts are preferred, and sodium<br><br>
chloride, potassium chloride, sodium sulfate, and the like are<br>
more preferred.<br>
Regarding a concentration of the above salt, high<br>
concentration is preferable. Specifically, the concentration<br>
is preferably 3 w/w% or above, more preferably 5 w/w% or above,<br>
and still more preferably 10 w/w% or above, relative to water.<br>
Moreover, it is particularly preferable to dissolve the above<br>
salt in a reaction system (aqueous medium) so as to be saturation<br>
or close to saturation.<br>
The above deoxygenated atmosphere can be attained by<br>
substitution with an inert gas, pressure reduction, boiling,<br>
or a combination of these. It is preferable to carry out at<br>
least the substitution with an inert gas, namely to use an inert<br>
gas atmosphere. As the inert gas, there may be mentioned, for<br>
example, nitrogen gas, carbon dioxide gas, helium gas, argon<br>
gas, hydrogen gas and the like. Nitrogen gas is preferred,<br>
however.<br>
It was found that the reduction reaction in the coexistence<br>
of a salt and/or under deoxygenated atmosphere mentioned above<br>
was particularly effective when dithionous acid or a salt<br>
is used as a reducing agent, and that such a reaction greatly<br>
contributed to an improvement of the yield in the reduction<br>
reaction or decrease of the reducing agent.<br>
Moreover, the above reduction reaction is carried out at<br>
pH of 7 or below, preferably at pH range of 3 to 7, and more<br>
preferably at pH range of 3 to 6. The above pH may be adjusted<br>
with acids (e.g. mineral acids such as. hydrochloric acid and<br>
sulfuric acid) or bases (e.g. alkaline metal hydroxides such<br>
as sodium hydroxide) .<br>
As described above, various factors may be appropriately<br>
controlled for minimizing a residence of oxidized coenzyme Q10<br>
or a formation of the oxidized coenzyme Q10 as a by-product from<br>
the reduced coenzyme Q10, and thus high-quality reduced coenzyme<br>
Q10 may be synthesized in a high yield.<br>
In the above reduction reaction, prexerable environment<br><br>
are provided, which enable the reduction reaction to preferably<br>
proceed, and residence, by-product formation and immixture of<br>
the oxidized coenzyme Q10 to minimize. Therefore, high yield<br>
maybe stably attained. Moreover, it isalsopossible tominimize<br>
the amount of the above dithionous acid or a salt to be used<br>
as a reducing agent.<br>
The amount of the dithionous acid or a salt to be used<br>
is not particularly restricted. From the economical viewpoint,<br>
however, the amount to be used may be not larger than the charged<br>
weight of oxidized coenzyme Q10. The lower limit may be<br>
preferably not smaller than about 1/5 by weight, more preferably<br>
not smaller than about 2/5 by weight, and still more preferably<br>
not smaller than about 3/5 by weight, based on the charged weight<br>
of oxidized coenzyme Q10. Thus, the reaction can be more<br>
favorably carried out with an amount within the range of about<br>
2/5 by weight of the above-mentioned charged weight to a weight<br>
roughly equal to that of the charged weight.<br>
The above reduction reaction is preferably carried out<br>
under forced flowing. The power required for stirring to cause<br>
such flowing per unit volume is generally not less than about<br>
0.01 kW/m3, preferably not less than about 0.1 kW/m3, and more<br>
preferably not less than about 0.3 kW/m3. The above forced<br>
flowing is generally caused by the turning of a stirring blade (s) ,<br>
but the use of a stirring blade (s) is not always necessary if<br>
the above flowing can be otherwise obtained. For example, a<br>
method based on liquid circulation may be utilized.<br>
The temperature for the above reduction reaction is not<br>
particularly restricted, but preferably 100°C or below, more<br>
preferably 80 °C or below, and still more preferably 60 °C or below.<br>
The lower limit of the temperature is preferably the<br>
solidification temperature of the system. The reaction may be<br>
preferably carried out at a temperature range of 0 to 100°C,<br>
more preferably at 0 to 80°C, and still more preferably at 0<br>
to 60°C.<br>
The substrate concentration in the above reduction<br><br>
reaction is not particularly restricted but the weight of<br>
oxidized coenzyme Q10 relative to the solvent weight is preferably<br>
not less than 1 w/w%, more preferably not less than 3 w/w %,<br>
still more preferably not less than 10 w/w%, and particularly<br>
preferably not less than 15 w/w%. The upper limit is not<br>
particularly restricted, too, but is preferably not more than<br>
about 60 w/w%, more preferably not more than 50 w/w%, still more<br>
preferably not more than 40 w/w%, and particularly preferably<br>
not more than 30 w/w%. Thus, the reaction can be favorably<br>
carried out at a substrate concentration of about 1 to 60 w/w%,<br>
preferably about 3 to 50 w/w%, and more preferably about 10 to<br>
40 w/w%.<br>
The above reduction reaction is carried out in an aqueous<br>
medium. The aqueous medium may be simple water, or may be a<br>
combination of water and an organic solvent.<br>
The above organic solvent is not particularly restricted,<br>
but preferably at least one species selected from hydrocarbons,<br>
fatty acid esters, ethers and nitriles in view of the yield and<br>
qualities of the reduced coenzyme Q10, and among them,<br>

to adequately carry out the above reduction reaction and,<br>
additionally, post-treatments after the reduction reaction.<br>
In selecting the solvent to be used from among the solvents<br>
mentioned above, such properties as boiling point and viscosity<br>
are preferably taken into consideration; forexample, thesolvent<br>
should have a boiling point which allows appropriate warming<br>
for increasing the solubility and facilitates solvent recovery<br>
from crystallization filtrates and a solvent removal from wet<br>
masses by drying (about 30 to 150°C at 1 atm), a melting point<br>
such that solidification hardly occurs in handling at room<br>
temperature as well as upon cooling to room temperature or below<br>
(not lower than about 0°C, preferably not lower than about 10°C,<br>
still more preferably not lower than about 20°C), and a low<br>
viscosity (not higher than about 10 cp at 20°C). From the<br>
industrial operation viewpoint, a solvent which is hardly<br>
volatile at ordinary temperature is preferred; generally, for<br>
example, one having a boiling point of not lower than about 80°C<br>
is preferred, and one having a boiling point of not lower than<br>
about 90°C is particularly preferred.<br>
The above reduction reaction can be driven to completion<br>
usually within 5 hours, preferably within 3 hours, and more<br>
preferably within 1 hour.<br>
The generated reduced coenzyme Q10 is extracted into an<br>
organic solvent from thus-obtained aqueous mixture after the<br>
reduction reaction to recover an organic phase containing the<br>
reduced coenzyme Q10. Then, if necessary (preferably), said<br><br>
organic phase is further washed with water repeatedly to<br>
completely remove impurities. The water to be used for washing<br>
is not particularly restricted, but preferably water or an<br>
aqueous solution containing a salt, preferably an inorganic salt<br>
such as sodium chloride, potassium chloride and sodium sulfate,<br>
etc. in view of easiness of liquid separation (wherein,<br>
concentration of the salt is preferably high, and it is usually<br>
5 w/w% or above, preferably about 10 w/w% or above, and more<br>
preferably a concentration of saturation or close to saturation) .<br>
The extraction and washing mentioned above may be carried out<br>
under acidic condition, preferably at pH of 6 or below, and more<br>
preferably at pH of 5 or below for minimizing the formation of<br>
oxidized coenzyme Q10 as a by-products.<br>
The organic solvent to be used for the extraction mentioned<br>
above is not particularly restricted. But from the fore<br>
mentioned viewpoints, it is preferable to use one species<br>
selected from hydrocarbons, fatty acid esters, ethers and<br>
nitriles as mentioned above. When the organic solvent is used<br>
together in the above reduction reaction, the same organic<br>
solvent is preferably used also as an extraction solvent.<br>
The thus-obtained organic phase containing the reduced<br>
coenzyme Q10 may be then subjected to operations appropriately<br>
combined among cooling, concentration, solvent substitution or<br>
the like, thereby crystallizing reduced coenzyme Q10. The<br>
high-quality reduced coenzyme Q10 recovered by the above method<br>
may be dried under normal pressure or reduced pressure.<br>
The above-mentioned treatments after the reduction<br>
reaction, namely a series of operation from extraction to<br>
recovering dried crystal, are carried out under deoxygenated<br>
atmosphere. Preferably, the treatment may be carried out, for<br>
example, under inert gas atmosphere such as nitrogen gas, helium<br>
gas, carbon dioxide gas, argon gas and hydrogen gas atmosphere,<br>
and particularly preferably under nitrogen gas atmosphere.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, various factors<br>
to inhibit residence, by-product formation and immixture of the<br><br>
oxidized coenzyme Q10 can be appropriately controlled, and thus<br>
high-quality reduced coenzyme Q10 may be obtained in a convenient<br>
and efficient manner at a high yield. The reduced coenzyme Q10<br>
as obtained in accordance with the present invention is a product<br>
with exceedingly high-quality, and can be expected to have a<br>
reduced coenzyme Q10/oxidized coenzyme Q10 weight ratio of not<br>
lower than 96/4, preferably not lower than 98/2, more preferably<br>
not lower than 99/1.<br>
