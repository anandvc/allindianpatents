				<td>This invention relates to a process for producing cellulose fibers or cellulose filament yarns with improved properties from pulp by the dry-jet wet-extrusion process using aqueous amine oxides, especially N-methylmorpholine N-oxide, as solvents, by a) pulp and aqueous amine oxide being dispersed at elevated temperature in a reactor and converted by water removal and shearing into a homogeneous solution having a zero shear viscosity in the range of 1 000 - 8 000 Pas and a relaxation time in the range of 0.5 - 80 seconds at 85°C, b) the solution being fed to at least one spinning die and being shaped, c) transporting the solution jet through a noncoagulating medium with simultaneous further shaping, and d) the cellulose filament or filament sheet being coagulated in a coagulation bath, separated from the coagulation bath by a deflecting element and subjected in a multistage aftertreatment to washing, finishing,   drying  and  optionally  crosslinking.<br>
[Prior  art]<br>
US patents 4 246 221 and 4 416 698 disclose dissolving cellulose in aqueous amine oxides, low-shear shaping in spinning capillaries, stretching the solution jets in a large air-gap, coagulating the cellulose by means of a spin bath containing aqueous amine oxide and withdrawing the  cellulose  filaments  via  a  godet.<br>
US patent 5 417 909 describes a process whereby the solution is subjected to shaping in the spinning capillaries at medium to high shear, the solution jets are stretched in a short air-gap, the cellulose is precipitated and the filaments or sheet of filaments are collected  via  a  spin  funnel  and  transported  cocurrently.<br><br>
EP 0 430 926, EP 0 494 852, EP 0 756 025 and WO 94/28 210 describe certain dies which vary in spinning capillary geometry and arrangement. WO 96/20 300 concerns the distance between two spinning capillaries and the path between spinning capillary and deflecting element in the coagulation  bath.<br>
EP 0 584 318, EP 0 671 492, EP 0 795 052, WO 94/28 218 and WO 96/21 758 describe a wide variety of ways of treating the filament sheet in the gap between spinnerette and coagulation bath with air of varying water  content.<br>
EP 0 659 219 describes the production of a cellulose fiber having a reduced tendency to fibrillate by keeping an empirical expression incorporating spinnerette hole diameter, dope flow, linear density, length of air-gap and moisture content of quench air to a value which does not exceed 10. EP 0731 856 proposes achieving a reduced tendency to fibrillate by including aliphatic alcohols in the quench air, while EP 0 853 146 proposes achieving a reduced tendency to fibrillate by performing the coagulation  in  two  or  more  stages.<br>
It is further known to modify fiber structure and properties through certain aftertreatment processes, such as treatment with crosslinking agents EP 0 783 602, EP 0 796 358, with 10 - 18% caustic soda WO 97/45 574 or with alkanol, alkanediol, alkanetriol in at least one wash bath WO 97/25 462. The chemical crosslinking as part of the aftertreatment, as well as producing a desirable increase in the wet abrasion resistance, leads to a distinct embrittlement of the fibers in that loop strength and breaking extension of the fibers decrease significantly.<br>
In all the abovementioned processes the fiber-forming step in the lyocell process is not regarded as a unit, but rather predominantly statically and it is tried to influence fiber structure and fiber properties by modifying individual steps such as for<br><br>
example the spinnerette geometry, the atmosphere in the air-gap, the coagulation bath design and/or the aftertreatment.<br>
[Object  of  invention]<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a process having an improved fiber-forming operation which captures all parameters relevant to fiber formation in one equation and thus permits controlled adjustment of fiber/filament properties on the basis of a solution of defined cellulose concentration, molar mass and molar mass distribution. The fibers spun according to the present invention shall permit subsequent crosslinking without  significant  embrittlement.<br>
It was found that fiber formation from the extremely viscoelastic cellulose solutions in the lyocell process can be understood as a two-step elongational deformation where elongational deformation takes place in the first step under the influence of the pressure in the die channel and in the second step under the axial elongational stress in the air-gap (cf fig. 1). The pressure  AP  is   given  by<br><br>
Here, nD is the elongational viscosity in Pas, £ is the elongation rate in s-1 , T10 is the fineness in dtex of the fiber  to  be   spun,   va  is  the  takeoff  speed  in  m/min,   pL  is<br><br>
the density of the solution in g/cm . Ccell. is the cellulose concentration of the spinning solution in %, DE is the inlet diameter and DA the outlet diameter of the spinning capillary in cm, 1 is the length of the spinning capillary in cm, a is the length of the air-gap in cm and SV is the spin-stretch ratio in the air-gap, ie the ratio of  takeoff  speed  to  extrusion  speed.<br>
The elongational viscosity is defined for any one spinning solution by the cellulose concentration, the molar mass and the molar mass distribution and changes only with the temperature and the elongation rate. The elongation  rate  of  the  overall  operation  is  given  by<br><br>
and     contains     all     process-relevant     parameters     which capture  the   kinetics  of  fiber  formation  in  particular. The   zero   shear   viscosity   and   the   zero   strain   viscosity are  directly  related  by  the  Trouton  equation:<br><br>
The zero shear viscosity of the cellulose solutions at 85°C is preferably 1 000 - 8 000 Pas when spinning into filaments and preferably 5 000 - 40 000 Pas when spinning into staple fibers. The width of the viscosity range results from the fact that the experimentally determinable zero shear viscosity of the cellulose solutions depends not only on the molar mass and concentration but also on their degree of solvation and will only attain a minimum end value when solvation is complete, ie after a long dissolving time. Commercially relevant    spinning    solutions    frequently    arrive    at    the<br><br><br><br>
spinning step in a state of incomplete solvation and so seem to possess a higher value for the zero shear viscosity or the molar mass, [cf Michels Ch. and Meister F. "Das Papier" 51 (1997) 4 p. 161 - 165 and Michels Ch. and Kosan B. "Chemical Fibers Intern." 50 (200) 12 p. 556 -  561] .<br>
It has now been found that there is a functional relationship between the elongation rate and the "quality of the fiber structure" as measured by the loop strength and the breaking extension of the fibers and filaments. Figures 2 and 3 show plots of respectively the loop strength and the breaking extension against the elongation rate for fiber samples obtained by spinning 3 cellulose solutions containing 11.2% of cellulose (cuoxam DP in range 507 - 527, polydispersity u^ = 5.9). The breaking strength of the 25 fiber samples was relatively constant at 41.1 ± 1.9 cN/tex and the variation of birefringence was low. In other words, the degree of orientation of the fiber samples was of the same order of magnitude, even though the spin-stretch ratio varied appreciably at values between 7 and 32. This also explains why there is probably a relationship between the work capacity of the fibers (product of breaking strength and breaking extension in J/g) and the elongation rate, although this is much less pronounced. In a preferred embodiment of the process according to the present invention, fibers are spun at an elongation rate in the range between 15 and 40 [1/s] and" the fibers are treated in the last stage prior to drying with a solution which simultaneously contains finish, a crosslinking agent and a crosslinking catalyst. The fiber obtained after drying and crosslinking possesses a distinctly enhanced wet abrasion resistance coupled with only minimal changes in the other fiber parameters. The finishing liquor also contains a bi- or polyfunctional crosslinking agent of the dialdehyde<br>
type, preferably glyoxal and/or derivatives thereof, and has a pH 
Another    embodiment    of    the    process    according    to    the<br><br>
present invention comprises spinning filament yarns at an elongation rate in the range 60 - 100 [1/s], removing the amine oxide by multistage washing, drying over a first heated pair of rolls to a water content &gt; 80%, using compressed air pad piston membrane pumps and spray nozzles to apply a defined amount of mixture of finish and crosslinking agent to the filament sheet, drying and crosslinking over a second heated pair of rolls. The filament yarn obtained possesses distinctly enhanced wet abrasion  resistance.<br>
The method for determining the wet abrasion resistance is extensively described in the literature [Mieck K.P.; Langner H. ; Nechwatal A. "Melliand Textilberichte" 74 (1993) p. 945; "Lenzinger Berichte" 74 (1994) p. 61 - 68; and Mieck K.P.; Nicolai A; Nechwatal A.; "Lenzinger Berichte" 76 (1997) p. 103]. The wet abrasion resistance is measured in terms of the number of rubbing cycles required of a roll of defined geometry that is covered with a cellulose cloth until a moistened fiber under a defined tension is ruptured. Lyocell fiber gives a wet abrasion resistance in the range between 10 and 50 rubbing cycles, depending on their molar mass and orientation. The literature cited also reveals that wet abrasion resistance is sufficient when the fiber test gives   ^   340  rubbing  cycles.<br>
The invention will now be more particularly described with  reference  to  examples:<br>
[Examples]<br>
Example  1<br>
465 g of activated and stabilized spruce sulfite pulp (water content 55% by mass; stabilizer 0.05% by mass; cuoxam DP 4 90; polydispersity Un, = 5.7) are dispersed in 2530 g of N-methylmorpholine N-oxide (NMMO) having a water content of 40% by mass and converted by heating, shearing   and   the   evaporative   removal   of   995   g   of   water<br><br>
into a homogeneous solution having a zero shear viscosity of 5 950 Pas, a relaxation time of 4.2 s and a filter value of 56. The solution consists of 12.8% by mass of cellulose, 75.9% by mass of NMMO and 11.3% by mass of water.<br>
Spinning was carried out on a pilot plant which makes it possible to produce not only staple fibers but also filament yarns. In the present example, fibers were produced  at  the  following  settings:<br>

Particle analysis gave a filter value of 90. The composition of the solution was 10.6% by mass of cellulose, 77.8% by mass of NMMO and 11.6% by mass of water. The cellulose mixture of the solution had a cuoxam DP  of  543  and  a  polydispersity  of  6.05.<br>
The   solution    (density   1.16   g/cm^)    was    spun   at   a   bulk temperature    of    80°C    through    a    die    having    30    spinning capillaries     (DE   =    221    µm;    DA   =    140    µm;    1    =    0.05    cm) through  an   air-gap   (a   =   5   cm)   with   a   spin-stretch   ratio of  16.4   and  a  takeoff  speed  of  72.8  m/min  into   1.12  dtex fiber.    The   resulting   elongation   rate   was   19.2   s"^.    The fiber    was    washed,     finished    and    dried    at    125°C     (A) . Concurrently,    in   a    second   test    series,    the    finishing liquor   also   contained   5   g/1   of   glyoxal   and   0.5   g/1   of magnesium   chloride    (pH   6.7).    Application   was   first   by spraying  the  fiber  which  had  been  predried  to  &gt;  80%  water (B)   and  secondly  by  dipping  and  squeezing  off  by  means  of a  pair  of  rolls    (C). Fiber  testing  revealed  the  following  values:<br><br><br>
