				<td>Technical field<br>
The present invention generally relates to the field of petrochemical industry, and<br>
specifically relates to a furnace tube structure of an ethylene cracking furnace being<br>
used in petrochemical industry.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
A cracking furnace is a critical equipment of an ethylene plant. The design of<br>
the radiant coils of the ethylene cracking furnace is the critical factor for determining<br>
the cracking selectivity, increasing the olefin yields in the pyrolysis products and the<br>
flexibility for different feedstocks. Improving the structure and arrangement of the<br>
radiant coils becomes the most important part for the technological development of<br>
tubular cracking furnace. In the recent decades, several arrangements with different<br>
structures, including single-row split diameter-varying tube type, mixed-rows split<br>
diameter-varying tube type, non-split diameter-varying tube type, single-pass<br>
even-diameter tube type, etc., have been presented.<br>
The arrangement manner of the radiant coils has been developed from the<br>
original single-row manner to the double-row manner. With regard to the single-row<br>
manner, it would need more floor space for the same capacity, but its advantages are<br>
that: the temperature distribution circumferentially around the radiant tubes is uniform<br>
and there is little shadow phenomenon; with regard to the double-row manner, it can<br>
substantively reduce the floor space of the cracking furnace, however, the shadow<br>
phenomenon is very serious and thus the temperature distribution circumferentially<br>
around the radiant tubes is negatively affected.<br>
Lummus Crest Inc. (US) discloses a furnace arrangement in China Patent<br>
CN1067669 having six first-pass tubes and one second-pass tube, the first tubes being<br>
connected at their lower ends via a manifold conduit to the second-pass tube. This<br>
kind of structure, as having six first-pass tubes and one second-pass tube, when the<br>
furnace tubes are subjected to heat and thus expand, the second-pass tube firstly<br>
expands downwardly, and the first-pass tubes move downwardly due to the traction of<br>
the second-pass tube, where the first-pass tubes farer from the second-pass tube are<br>
subjected to less force, and the first-pass tubes nearer to the second-pass tube are<br>
subjected to more force; In addition, due to that the upper and lower manifold<br>
conduits are connected rigidly, the expansion difference between the second-pass tube<br>
and the first-pass tubes can only be adjusted by the balance system arranged at the<br>
inlet of the first-pass tubes, and thus the results are that: when the first-pass tubes<br>
cannot move together with the second-pass tube, the furnace tubes will be bent<br>
Exxon Chemical Patents Inc. (US) discloses an arrangement in Patent<br>
 <br>
CN1259981, and meanwhile discloses another arrangement in Patent US6528027.<br>
The common drawback of the two different arrangements of the radiant coil are that:<br>
as the lower part a first-pass tube inclines outwardly but the second-pass tube do not<br>
incline in a reverse direction, meanwhile the adjacent first-pass tube inclines toward<br>
the other side, the results are that, when the radiant tubes are subjected to the heating,<br>
the overall radiant coils cannot be kept in a single-row, and will naturally present a<br>
two-row so as to eliminate stresses. The result is that, the heating of the radiant<br>
tubes are not uniform and thus there have the temperature difference between the<br>
two sides of the radiant tube walls, the temperature of the side adjacent to burners is<br>
high and the temperature of the opposite side is low, thus the furnace tubes will bend<br>
toward the burners.<br>
Patent EP1146105 discloses a cracking furnace with such a kind of tube<br>
arrangement: two-passes radiant coils are vertically disposed in the firebox of the<br>
radiant section, the linear tube portions of the first-pass tubes and the second-pass<br>
tubes are arranged in a common plane, each of the first-pass straight tubes and the<br>
second-pass tubes is connected to a curved tube via a "S" shaped tube, respectively,<br>
the "S" shaped tubes of the first-pass tubes and the second-pass tubes are parallel,<br>
respectively, the shape of connecting curved tube may be semi-circle, semi-ellipse or<br>
semi-oviform, the angle formed by the respective curved tubes with respect to the<br>
plane containing the linear tube portions are the same. This kind of tube<br>
arrangement overcomes the drawbacks of the aforementioned radiant coil structure.<br>
However, as the 2-1 type radiant coil has a "Y" shaped tube at the lower portion of<br>
"two-tube section" of the first-pass tube, tube bending would still exist due to that the<br>
two tubes connected to the "Y" shaped tube are different with regard to the expansion<br>
due to the heating of the two radiant tubes.<br>
When reviewing the aforementioned prior art, it can be seen that none of the<br>
various conventional radiant coil arrangements can avoid tube deformation or<br>
bending and displacement. Further, this kind of deformation or bending will make<br>
that the heating of the radiant tube is not uniform, and thus the radiant tubes will be<br>
further deformed and displaced. The heat absorptivity is thus limited and the<br>
lifespan of the radiant tubes of cracking furnace is shortened.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
An object of the present invention is to solve the difficult problems of the prior<br>
art by providing an ethylene cracking furnace having two-pass radiant coils that can<br>
ensure uniform heating, fine mechanical performance and extended lifespan.<br>
The object is realized by the following technical solutions.<br>
An ethylene cracking furnace comprising a high pressure steam drum, a<br>
convection section, a radiant section, multiple groups of radiant coils arranged<br>
vertically in the firebox of the radiation section, burners and transfer line exchangers,<br>
 <br>
each radiant coil comprising a first-pass tube, a second-pass tube and a connection<br>
member for connecting the first-pass tube and the second-pass tube; feedstocks being<br>
introduced into an inlet end of the first-pass tube and outflow from an outlet end of<br>
the second-pass tube; said first-pass tube and said second-pass tube are non-split<br>
radiant tubes, and the centerlines of the respective radiant tubes are within a common<br>
plane; said connection member is a tridimensional structural member comprising an<br>
inlet bending tube, a return bending tube and an outlet bending tube; each first-pass<br>
tube is connected to an end of an inlet bending tube at the bottom end of the first-pass<br>
tube distal to the inlet end thereof, another end of the inlet bending tube is connected<br>
to an end of a return bending tube, another end of the return bending tube is connected<br>
to an end of an outlet bending tube, and another end of the outlet bending tube is<br>
connected to the bottom end of a second-pass tube that is distal to the outlet end<br>
thereof; said inlet bending tubes and said outlet bending tubes are arranged at two<br>
sides of the plane containing the centerlines of said first-pass tubes and said<br>
second-pass tubes, respectively; a plane formed by the centerlines of a group of inlet<br>
bending tubes intersects with a plane formed by the centerlines of a group of outlet<br>
bending tubes (in a side view), the intersecting line is within the plane containing the<br>
centerlines of said first-pass tubes and said second-pass tubes, and said two planes<br>
formed by the centerlines of the inlet bending tubes and the outlet bending tubes are<br>
symmetrical with respect to the plane containing the centerlines of said first-pass<br>
tubes and said second-pass tubes; the return bending tubes connecting the group of<br>
inlet bending tubes and the group of outlet bending tubes are parallel to each other,<br>
and their projections in a top view are straight lines with the same length; the<br>
projections of the respective connection members in a side view are the same curve<br>
line that is symmetrical, continuous and closed, and<br>
For satisfying the requirements of lowering temperature and reducing pressure<br>
drop during cracking process while keeping the heat absorptivity unchanged, the<br>
radiant coils can be arranged in a diameter-varying manner. For different<br>
requirements, the diameter-varying arrangement can be realized with many<br>
alternatives (including but not limited to the following listed alternatives), wherein the<br>
length of the first-pass tubes and the second-pass tubes are the same in each<br>
alternative:<br>
(1)	the inner diameter of said first-pass tube equals to the inner diameter of said<br>
connection member, the inner diameter of said second-pass tube differs from the inner<br>
diameter of said first-pass tube and said connection member, the inner diameter of<br>
said second-pass tube is larger than inner diameter of said first-pass tube and said<br>
connection member, this alternative can be referred to as "once diameter-varying";<br>
(2)	the inner diameter of said first-pass tube equals to the inner diameter of said<br>
connection member, the inner diameter of the lower portion of said second-pass tube<br>
equals to the inner diameter of said first-pass tube and said connection member, the<br>
 <br>
inner diameter of the upper portion of said second-pass tube is larger than the inner<br>
diameter of the lower portion thereof, this alternative can be referred to as "twice<br>
diameter-varying";<br>
(3)	the inner diameter of said first-pass tube is even, the inner diameter of said<br>
connection member is larger than the inner diameter of said first-pass tube, the inner<br>
diameter of said second-pass tube equals to the inner diameter of said connection<br>
member;<br>
(4)	the inner diameter of said first-pass tube is even, the inner diameter of said<br>
connection member is larger than the inner diameter of said first-pass tube, the inner<br>
diameter of the lower portion of said second-pass tube equals to the inner diameter of<br>
said connection member, the inner diameter of the upper portion of said second-pass<br>
tube is larger than the inner diameter of the lower portion thereof, this alternative can<br>
be referred to as "triple diameter-varying";<br>
(5)	the inner diameter of said first-pass tube is even, the inner diameter of said<br>
connection member is larger than the inner diameter of said first-pass tube, the inner<br>
diameter of the lower portion of said second-pass tube is larger than the inner<br>
diameter of said connection member, the inner diameter of the upper portion of said<br>
second-pass tube is larger than the inner diameter of the lower portion thereof, this<br>
alternative can be referred to as "quartic diameter-varying"; and<br>
(6)	the inner diameter of said first-pass tube is variational: the inner diameter of<br>
the lower portion of said first-pass tube is larger than the inner diameter of the upper<br>
portion thereof.<br>
With the abovementioned diameter-varying arrangements, the cross-section area<br>
of the radiant coil increases as the cracking process advances, thus the pressure drop<br>
along the tube length is decreased (the partial pressures of hydrocarbons are decreased)<br>
and thus the requirements of the cracking reaction are better satisfied, resulting in a<br>
high cracking performance. For the same yield of the cracking products, the<br>
cracking temperature can be lowered; while for the same cracking temperature, the<br>
yield of the ethylene products can be effectively improved.<br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, in each<br>
group of radiant coils, the respective first-pass tubes are parallel to each other, the<br>
respective second-pass tubes are parallel to each other, and the first-pass tubes and the<br>
second-pass tubes are parallel to each other; the projection of the plane containing the<br>
centerlines of said first-pass tubes and said second-pass tubes in a top view is a<br>
straight line; said respective inlet bending tubes are parallel to each other with their<br>
projections in a top view forming the same inlet angle with respect to said straight line;<br>
said respective outlet bending tubes are parallel to each other with their projections in<br>
a top view forming the same outlet angle with respect to said straight line; said inlet<br>
angle equals to said outlet angle.<br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, in each<br>
 <br>
group of radiant coils, the respective first-pass tubes are parallel to each other, the<br>
respective second-pass tubes are parallel to each other, and the first-pass tubes and the<br>
second-pass tubes are parallel to each other; the projection of the plane containing the<br>
centerlines of said first-pass tubes and said second-pass tubes in a top view is a<br>
straight line; said respective inlet bending tubes are not parallel to each other with<br>
their projections in a top view forming different inlet angles with respect to said<br>
straight line; said respective outlet bending tubes are not parallel to each other with<br>
their projections in a top view forming different outlet angles with respect to said<br>
straight line; but for each radiant tube, said inlet angle equals to said outlet angle.<br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, said radiant<br>
coils may comprise at least one tube section having a twisted baffle therein, said<br>
twisted baffle extends inside the tube section along the axis thereof to form two<br>
helical passages at the opposite sides of said twisted baffle, said twisted baffle being<br>
integrally formed with said tube section.<br>
As having twisted baffles provided within the radiant coils of the present<br>
invention, when the in-process materials pass through the surface of said twisted<br>
baffle inside the tube section, said twisted baffle directs the in-process materials away<br>
from the center of the tube section, flowing forward helically other than straight<br>
forward, so that the in-process materials passing through inside the tube section flow<br>
laterally while going forward, so as to strongly spray onto the inner surface of the tube<br>
section. In this way, the thickness of the peripheral laminar-flow layer (which<br>
normally has high heat resistance, especially when having large thickness) on the<br>
inner surface of the tube section is substantively decreased, and therefore the heat<br>
transfer efficiency is improved. The improved heat transfer efficiency, in turn,<br>
lowers the temperature of the inner wall of the radiant coils and thus the coking<br>
tendency is restrained, and this will further improve the heat transfer efficiency.<br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the twisted<br>
angle of said twisted baffle is between 100~360°, the axial length of said tube<br>
section with every twisted angle 180° of the twisted baffle is a pitch, the ratio of said<br>
pitch to the inner diameter of said tube section is in the range of from 2 to 3; the<br>
thickness of said twisted baffle substantially corresponds to that of the wall of said<br>
tube section; in each cross-section of said tube section, the transition zone from the<br>
surface of said twisted baffle to the surface of said tube section, and vice versa, is in<br>
the shape of a concave circular arc.<br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, said radiant<br>
coils comprise multiple tube sections each having a twisted baffle therein, the<br>
multiple tube sections are arranged in at least a predetermined length of said radiant<br>
coils spaced apart with each other, the distance between two adjacent tube sections is<br>
at least five pitches. This kind of arrangement makes that: the total length of all said<br>
tube sections with the twisted baffle(s) is only a small part of the entire length of the<br>
 <br>
radiant coils. Therefore, the resistance to the flowing in-process materials would not<br>
be increased substantially, so that the in-process materials can go forward in a helical<br>
motion state so as to improve the heat transfer efficiency, while the flowing speed of<br>
the in-processing flow would not decrease substantially<br>
With the help of said twisted baffle inside said tube section, the in-processing<br>
materials are directed laterally away from the center of the tube section, so as to<br>
strongly spray onto the inner surface of the tube section. In this way, the thickness<br>
of the peripheral laminar-flow layer (which normally has high heat resistance,<br>
especially when having large thickness) on the inner surface of the tube section is<br>
substantively decreased. Therefore, the resistance of the tube wall to the<br>
in-processing materials is decreased, thus the advance speed of the in-processing<br>
materials can be properly increased.<br>
As the temperature of the inner tube walls of the radiant coils of the cracking<br>
furnace is lowered, the lifespan of the radiant coils of the cracking furnace is<br>
extended.<br>
With the same reasons, by means of arranging said tube section(s) with the<br>
twisted baffle(s) in the tubular cracking furnace, the heat transfer efficiency can be<br>
improved with a lower cost, and larger amount of flowing in-processing materials can<br>
go through the furnace.<br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
projection shape of said return bending tube in a side view is camber, semi-circular,<br>
semi-ellipse or parabola.<br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, said group<br>
of radiant coils may comprise at least two radiant coils, and all of the first-pass tubes<br>
and all of the second-pass tubes in each group of radiant coils are collectively<br>
arranged, respectively.<br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
second-pass tubes of two groups of radiant coils are adjacently arranged so as to form<br>
a module; a plurality of said modules are arranged within the radiant section of the<br>
cracking furnace, and the centerlines of the first-pass tubes and the second-pass tubes<br>
of each of the groups are within the same plane.<br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the radiant<br>
section of the cracking furnace is arranged with multiple groups of radiant coils, the<br>
first-pass tubes of one group of radiant coil(s) are arranged adjacent to the<br>
second-pass tubes of another group of radiant coil(s), and the centerlines of the<br>
first-pass tubes and the second-pass tubes of each of the groups are within the same<br>
plane.<br>
In the abovementioned arrangements, due to that the projections of the respective<br>
connection members in a side view are the same curve line that is symmetrical,<br>
continuous and closed, when subjected to heat, the deformation of the connection<br>
 <br>
members is also symmetrical. Therefore, it can ensure that the heating is uniform,<br>
and the single-row arrangement can be kept unchanged. Specifically, the two pass<br>
radiant coils are within the same plane, the connection members of the two pass<br>
radiant coils are arranged at the two sides of said plane, the gravity center of the tubes<br>
is within the plane. Meanwhile, the first-pass tubes and the second-pass tubes are<br>
arranged together in group, respectively. When the second-pass tubes expand<br>
downwardly, both the connection members and the first-pass tubes move regularly in<br>
the same direction, thus when operating in a heating state, tube bending and<br>
movement direction differentiation (due to the gravity center of the tubes are not<br>
within the plane of the tubes) can be avoided, and thus further ensuring that the<br>
first-pass tubes and the second-pass tubes are within the center plane of the furnace<br>
chamber, and therefore the object of avoiding uneven heating is realized. Therefore,<br>
furnaces having such kind of arrangement of radiant coils have advantages of long<br>
lifespan and good mechanical properties, etc.<br>
In each group of radiant coils, the respective first-pass tubes are parallel to each<br>
other, the respective second-pass tubes are parallel to each other, and the first-pass<br>
tubes and the second-pass tubes are parallel to each other; the projection of the plane<br>
containing the centerlines of said first-pass tubes and said second-pass tubes in a top<br>
view is a straight line. However, the inlet bending tubes and the outlet bending tubes<br>
can be arranged in several manners. One manner is that: said respective inlet<br>
bending tubes are parallel to each other with their projections in a top view forming<br>
the same inlet angle with respect to said straight line; said respective outlet bending<br>
tubes are parallel to each other with their projections in a top view forming the same<br>
outlet angle with respect to said straight line; said inlet angle equals to said outlet<br>
angle. Another manner is that: said respective inlet bending tubes are not parallel to<br>
each other with their projections in a top view forming different inlet angles with<br>
respect to said straight line; said respective outlet bending tubes are not parallel to<br>
each other with their projections in a top view forming different outlet angles with<br>
respect to said straight line; but for each radiant tube, said inlet angle equals to said<br>
outlet angle.<br>
Based on different requirements, said group of radiant coils may comprise two or<br>
more radiant coils, and all of the first-pass tubes and all of the second-pass tubes in<br>
each group of radiant coils are collectively arranged, respectively. The radiation<br>
section of the cracking furnace is arranged with multiple groups of radiant tubes and<br>
the arrangement can be in several manners, one manner is that: the second-pass tubes<br>
of two groups of radiant coils are adjacently arranged so as to form a module and the<br>
centerlines of the first-pass tubes and the second-pass tubes of the two groups are<br>
within the same plane; a plurality of said modules are arranged within the radiant<br>
section of the cracking furnace, and the centerlines of the first-pass tubes and the<br>
second-pass tubes of each of the groups are within the same plane. Another manner<br>
 <br>
is that: the first-pass tubes of one group of radiant coils are arranged adjacent to the<br>
second-pass tubes of another group of radiant coils, and the centerlines of the<br>
first-pass tubes and the second-pass tubes of each of the groups are within the same<br>
plane. With such arrangement, when the arrangement of the radiant coils has odd<br>
number, the first-pass tubes and the second-pass tubes can be arranged alternately, and<br>
therefore the heating of the tubes in the firebox of the radiant section would be more<br>
uniform.<br>
According to practical requirements, the twisted baffles may be integrated with<br>
the diameter-varying zones of the tubes so as to reduce cost and improve the heat<br>
transfer effect; the twisted baffles may also be arranged at non-variation zones of the<br>
tubes. The overall object is to improve the diameter-varying effect so as to improve<br>
the cracking performance, i.e., to extend the runlength and improve the olefin yields.<br>
When implementing the invention, the number of the groups of the radiant coils<br>
relates to the capability of the furnace, and it can be determined in accordance with<br>
the design conditions of the feedstocks, the capacity of the cracking furnace, the<br>
runlength, etc.<br>
Generally speaking, when comparing with the prior art technologies, the present<br>
invention provides the following beneficial effects:<br>
(1)	As the radiant coils of the present invention are arranged in a<br>
diameter-varying manner, especially a continuous and multiple diameter-varying<br>
manner, the cross-section of the radiant coil increases as the cracking process<br>
advances, thus the pressure drop within the tube length is decreased and thus the<br>
requirements of the cracking reaction are better satisfied, resulting in a high cracking<br>
performance. For the same yield of the cracking products, the cracking temperature<br>
can be lowered; on the other hand, for the same cracking temperature, the yield of the<br>
olefin products can be effectively improved.<br>
(2)	The tube wall temperature of the radiant tubes during practical operating is<br>
lowered. The runlength is extended and the times of increase and decrease the firebox<br>
temperature can be reduced. The furnace tubes have good mechanical performance<br>
and thus are not likely to be bent. The lifespan of the tubes can be extended for<br>
additional 2 to 3 years.<br>
(3)	As mentioned above, due to the provision of the tube section(s) with internal<br>

Detailed description of the preferred embodiments<br>
The present invention will be described in detail hereinafter with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br>
As shown in Figure 1, the ethylene cracking furnace in accordance with the<br>
present invention comprises a high pressure steam drum 1, a convection section 2, a<br>
radiant section 3, multiple groups of radiant coils 4 arranged vertically in the radiant<br>
section, burners 5 and transfer line exchangers 6.<br>
As shown in Figure 2, each radiant coil comprises a first-pass tube 7, a<br>
second-pass tube 8 and a connection member 9 for connecting the first-pass tube and<br>
the second-pass tube; feedstocks will be introduced into an inlet end of the first-pass<br>
tube 7 and outflow from an outlet end of the second-pass tube 8.<br>
Said first-pass tube 7 and said second-pass tube 8 are non-split radiant tubes, and<br>
the centerlines of the respective radiant tubes are within a common plane; The<br>
diameter of said first-pass tube 7, said second-pass tube 8 and said connection<br>
 <br>
member 9 is varied at least once.<br>
Said connection member 9 is a tridimensional structural member comprising an<br>
inlet bending tube 10, a return bending tube 11 and an outlet bending tube 12; each<br>
first-pass tube 7 is connected to an end of an inlet bending tube 10 at the bottom end<br>
of the first-pass tube 7 distal to the inlet end thereof, another end of the inlet bending<br>
tube 10 is connected to an end of a return bending tube 11, another end of the return<br>
bending tube 11 is connected to an end of an outlet bending tube 12, and another end<br>
of the outlet bending tube 12 is connected to the bottom end of a second-pass tube 8<br>
that is distal to the outlet end thereof.<br>
Said inlet bending tubes 10 and said outlet bending tubes 12 are arranged at two<br>
sides of the plane containing the centerlines of said first-pass tubes 7 and said<br>
second-pass tubes 8, respectively; a plane formed by the centerlines of a group of inlet<br>
bending tubes 10 intersects with a plane formed by the centerlines of a group of outlet<br>
bending tubes 12, the intersecting line is within the plane containing the centerlines of<br>
said first-pass tubes 7 and said second-pass tubes 8, and said two planes formed by the<br>
centerlines of the inlet bending tubes and the outlet bending tubes are symmetrical<br>
with respect to the plane containing the centerlines of said first-pass tubes and said<br>
second-pass tubes; the return bending tubes 11 connecting the group of inlet bending<br>
tubes 10 and the group of outlet bending tubes 12 are parallel to each other, and their<br>
projections in a top view are straight lines with the same length; the shape of the<br>
return bending tubes 11 in a side view is semi-circular. The projections of the<br>
respective connection members 9 in the side view are the same curve line that is<br>
symmetrical, continuous and closed.<br>
In each group of radiant coils, the respective first-pass tubes 7 are parallel to<br>
each other, the respective second-pass tubes 8 are parallel to each other, and the<br>
first-pass tubes 7 and the second-pass tubes 8 are parallel to each other; the projection<br>
of the plane containing the centerlines of said first-pass tubes 7 and said second-pass<br>
tubes 8 in a top view is a straight line. However, the inlet bending tubes 10 and the<br>
outlet bending tubes 12 can be arranged in several manners:<br>
One manner is shown in Figure 2: said respective inlet bending tubes are parallel<br>
to each other with their projections in a top view forming the same inlet angle with<br>
respect to said straight line; said respective outlet bending tubes are parallel to each<br>
other with their projections in a top view forming the same outlet angle with respect<br>
to said straight line; said inlet angle equals to said outlet angle, preferably 70°.<br>
Another manner is that: said respective inlet bending tubes 10 are not parallel to<br>
each other with their projections in a top view forming different inlet angles with<br>
respect to said straight line; said respective outlet bending tubes 12 are not parallel to<br>
each other with their projections in a top view forming different outlet angles with<br>
respect to said straight line, with the angle varying in a range of 65° to 90°; but for<br>
each radiant tube, said inlet angle equals to said outlet angle.<br>
 <br>
Based on different requirements, a group of radiant coils may comprise two or<br>
more radiant coils, and all of the first-pass tubes 7 and all of the second-pass tubes 8<br>
in each group of radiant coils are collectively arranged, respectively. The radiant<br>
section of the cracking furnace is arranged with multiple groups of radiant coils and<br>
the arrangement can be in several manners. One manner is that: the second-pass<br>
tubes of two groups of radiant coils are adjacently arranged so as to form a module<br>
and the centerlines of the first-pass tubes and the second-pass tubes of the two groups<br>
are within the same plane; the inlet bending tubes of the connection members of the<br>
first group and the inlet bending tubes of the connection members of the second group<br>
are arranged at the opposite two sides (Figure 4) or the same side (Figure 5); a<br>
plurality of said modules are arranged within the radiant section of the cracking<br>
furnace, and the centerlines of the first-pass tubes 7 and the second-pass tubes 8 of<br>
each of the groups are within the same plane. Another manner is shown in Figure 6:<br>
the first-pass tubes of one group of radiant coils are arranged adjacent to the<br>
second-pass tubes of another group of radiant coils, and the centerlines of the<br>
first-pass tubes and the second-pass tubes of each of the groups are within the same<br>
plane.<br>
For satisfying the requirements of lowering temperature and reducing pressure<br>
drop during cracking process while keeping the heat absorptivity unchanged, the<br>
radiant coils can be arranged in a diameter-varying manner. For different<br>
requirements, the diameter-varying arrangement can be realized with many<br>
alternatives:<br>
An alternative: the inner diameter of said first-pass tube 7 equals to the inner<br>
diameter of said connection member 9, the inner diameter of the lower portion of said<br>
second-pass tube differs from the inner diameter of said connection member 9, and<br>
the inner diameter of the upper portion of said second-pass tube 9 also differs from<br>
the inner diameter of the lower portion thereof (Figure 7);<br>
Another alternative: the inner diameter of said first-pass tube 7 is varying (the<br>
inner diameter of the upper portion differs from the inner diameter of the lower<br>
portion), the inner diameter of the connection member 9 equals to that of the lower<br>
portion of the first-pass tube 7, and the inner diameter of the second-pass tube is even<br>
(unchanged) (Figure 8);<br>
A further Alternative: the inner diameter of said first-pass tube 7 is varying (the<br>
inner diameter of the upper portion differs from the inner diameter of the lower<br>
portion), the inner diameter of the connection member 9 equals to that of the lower<br>
portion of the first-pass tube 7, the inner diameter of the lower portion of the<br>
second-pass tube 8 differs from that of the connection member 9, and the inner<br>
diameter of the upper portion of the second-pass tube 8 differs from that of the lower<br>
portion thereof (Figure 9).<br>
When implementing the invention, the number of the groups of radiant coils<br>
 <br>
relates to the capability of the furnace, and it can be determined in accordance with<br>
the design conditions of the feedstocks, the yield of the cracking furnace, the<br>
runlength, etc.<br>
The process performance parameters of different embodiments adopting 48<br>
radiant coils are as following:<br>

 <br>
In addition, as shown in Figures 10-14, the present invention also provides a tube<br>
section 100 with twisted baffle. From the sectional view shown in Figure 11, it can<br>
be seen that the tube section 100 with a twisted baffle according to the present<br>
invention comprises a tube or flue portion 110 and a twisted baffle or turbulator<br>
portion 120. Said twisted baffle portion 120 is integrated with said tube portion 110<br>
of the tube section 100. As shown in Figure 11, said twisted baffle portion 120<br>
extends diametrically across said tube portion 110 so as to divide the inner cavity of<br>
the tube section 100 into a pair of passages 130 and 140 for flowing in-process<br>
materials. Said passages 130 and 140 have substantially the same cross section area.<br>
According to the concept of the present invention, in every cross section of said<br>
tube section 100, each of the transition zones between the surface of said twisted<br>
baffle and the inner wall surface of said tube section 100 in the passages 130 and 140,<br>
i.e., the corner portions 150, 160, 170 and 180 as shown in Figure 11, are in the shape<br>
of a concave circular arc. Specifically, the radius of said concave circular arc cannot<br>
be too long, otherwise, the passages 130 and 140 will be too narrow so as to limit the<br>
flow rate of the in-process materials. On the other hand, the radius of said concave<br>
circular arc cannot be too short, otherwise, the in-process materials will form eddy<br>
and be easy to begin coking in the comer portions.<br>
The length of the tube section with twisted baffle as shown in Figure 10 is one<br>
pitch, Therefore, the end view seen in the direction of arrow A is the same as that<br>
seen in the direction of arrow E. As shown in Figure 11, the twisted baffle portion<br>
120 is in the horizontal state.<br>
Figure 12 shows a sectional view of the tube section 100 of Figure 10, which is<br>
located in the point of 1/4 of the entire length of the tube section 100 from the left end<br>
thereof. As shown in Figure 12, the twisted baffle 120 is in an inclined state with an<br>
angle of 45°of inclination leftward and upward.<br>
Figure 13 shows a sectional view of the tube section 100 of Figure 10, which is<br>
located in the point of 1/2 of the entire length of the tube section 100 from the left end<br>
thereof. As shown in Figure 13, the twisted baffle 120 is in a vertical state.<br>
Figure 14 shows a sectional view of the tube section 100 of Figure 10, which is<br>
 <br>
located in the point of 3/4 of the entire length of the tube section 100 from the left end<br>
thereof. As shown in Figure 14, the twisted baffle 120 is in an inclined state with an<br>
angle of 45°of inclination rightward and upward.<br>
In a word, in the present invention, the geometrical form and dimensions in<br>
every axially cross sections of the tube section 100 are always the same, the difference<br>
is only in that the twisted baffle portion 120 is in different angles of inclination. The<br>
tridimensional shape of the twisted baffle portion 120 can be figured out with Figures<br>
10 to 14.<br>
In practice, the twisted baffle portion 120 can be twisted both in the left-handed<br>
way and in the right-handed way.<br>
The twisted baffle portion 120 can be arranged diametrically or not diametrically<br>
(offset from the diameter direction). When arranged not diametrically, the passages<br>
130 and 140 would have different cross-sectional areas.<br>
The cross section of the twisted baffle portion 120 can be linear (as shown in<br>
Figures 10-14), or can be curvilinear (not shown).<br>
According to practical requirements, the twisted baffle portion 120 can be<br>
designed to have a more complex form so as to divide the inner cavity of the tube<br>
section into more than two passages for flowing in-process materials.<br>
In the present invention, the term "pitch" S refers to an axial length of the tube<br>
section with every twisted angle 180° of the twisted baffle. The term "twisted ratio"<br>
Y refers to the ratio between the pitch S and the internal diameter D of said tube<br>
section, i.e., Y-S/D.<br>
Accordingly, when the value of Y is smaller, the twisted degree of the twisted<br>
baffle is higher. Therefore, the in-process materials in the tube section have a higher<br>
tendency of lateral flowing, the heat transfer efficiency is better, and the coking<br>
tendency would be better decreased. However, if the value of Y is too small, the<br>
resistance to the flowing in-process materials would be greatly increased and thus the<br>
flowing speed of the in-process materials would be limited.<br>
On the other hand, when the value of Y is larger, the twisted degree of the<br>
twisted baffle is lower. Therefore, the in-process materials in the tube section have a<br>
lower tendency of lateral flowing, the resistance to the flowing in-process materials<br>
would be decreased and thus the flowing speed of the in-process materials would be<br>
improved. However, the heat transfer efficiency would be decreased, and the coking<br>
tendency would be less decreased.<br>
Therefore, it is important to determine a suitable twisted ratio. In the present<br>
invention, Y=2.5 can realize perfect nice effect; while the apparatus would work very<br>
well when Y is selected from the range of from 2 to 3.<br>
If the tube section with twisted baffle is axially provided in the entire length of<br>
the furnace tubes, the efficiency of the heat transfer can be greatly increased.<br>
However, the resistance to the flowing in-process materials would also be increased<br>
 <br>
greatly and therefore the flowing speed would be decreased. For this reason, in the<br>
present invention, the tube section with twisted baffle is only arranged at several<br>
places of the furnace tubes, and two adjacent tube sections with twisted baffle are<br>
separated from each other by a certain length of the tube without twisted baffle<br>
(empty tube section). As the in-process materials has a helical inertia force when<br>
leaving the tube section with twisted baffle, the in-process materials can still flow<br>
forwardly while move helically within the empty tube section.<br>
The interval between two adjacent tube sections with twisted baffle can be set at<br>
least 5 pitches. In accordance with several preferred embodiments, the interval can<br>
be 15 to 20 pitches.<br>
