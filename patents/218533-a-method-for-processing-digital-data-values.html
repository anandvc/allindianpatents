Description<br>
Method for processing digital data values<br>
The invention relates to a method for processing digital data<br>
values, in which a predictor method is used to form a<br>
difference value from the respective current digital data value<br>
and from a respective predicted value, and compressed values<br>
are produced from the difference values using a RICE method<br>
which follows the predictor method.<br>
A method such as this is known to those skilled in the act<br>
from, for example, the Internet site which can be called up at<br>
http;//www.monkeysaudio,com/theory.html (called up on<br>
November 11, 2002). This site explains how digital audio data<br>
can be compressed for the purpose of compression with the aid<br>
of a predictor method and a subsequent RICE method. Those audio<br>
data values which immediately precede the current audio data<br>
values are in each case used to calculate predicted values<br>
which are required for the predictor method.<br>
Measurement values from processes that are being carried out,<br>
for example from production or from conversion processes, are<br>
also usually recorded in digital form for closed-loop and open-<br>
loop control of industrial plant, and are, made availab1e as<br>
output information for subsequent processing. The subsequent<br>
processing may, for example, be readjustment of a processed<br>
variable. In this case, it is often necessary Co transfer the<br>
recorded measurement values. in the form of digital data values<br>
or digital measurement data between different technical plant,<br>
or to Store such measurement values for subsequent processing.<br>
In order to reduce the amount of data<br><br>
PCT/DE 2003/003862 		-2-<br>
2002F11723WOIN <br>
required for transmission of the digital measurement data,<br>
provision is made in conjunction with a closed-loop filling<br>
level control system that is known from the document<br>
WO 01/91031 for the digital measurement data to be compressed<br>
by means of digital data compression, before being transmitted.<br>
This makes it possible to reduce the bandwidth required for<br>
data transmission.<br>
One object of the invention is to specify a comparatively fast<br>
method for compression of digital data values.<br>
For a method of the type mentioned initially, this object is<br>
achieved according to the invention by obtaining the respective<br>
predicted value by means of a signal model which describes the<br>
expected time profile of the digital data values.<br>
The major, advantage which is achieved by the invention over the<br>
prior art is that a significant reduction is. achieved in the<br>
memory space requirement for the compressed values determined<br>
from the digital data values, and at high speed, with the aid<br>
of the proposed method. This is because, the digital data, values<br>
can be compressed without any losses in real time, that is to<br>
say immediately after they have been, recorded. The predicted<br>
values for the predictor method are determined as quickly end<br>
reliably as possible in that, when the pzedictor method is<br>
being carried out, the predicted values are determined on the<br>
basis of a signal model which is suitable for describing the<br>
time profile of the digital data values. The use of a signsl<br>
model such as this means that the predicted values are<br>
available to form the difference values without the need.<br><br>
PCT/DE 2003/003862 	- 3 -<br>
2002F11723WOIN <br>
for a calculation in each case on the basis of previous data<br>
values, and thus without any time delay.<br>
The space required in the memory is leas than that for<br>
uncompressed data values. The proposed method results in the<br>
memory space requirement being reduced with minimal computation<br>
power for processing of the digital data values, since only<br>
simple computation operations are required, such as addition,<br>
subtraction and bit manipulations. This makes it possible to<br>
use the stated method for processing digital data values even<br>
in technical equipment which has the computation power. by means<br>
of suitable processors only to a restricted extent. The<br>
requirement tor computation power for compression, which is not<br>
available for other functions, is minimized.<br>
The compression process carried out using the method according<br>
to the invention means that, in, this case, only data which<br>
contains no. information is removed. The digital measurement<br>
data can thus be reproduced completely, that is to say without<br>
any losses, during the decompression process,.<br>
One embodiment of the method according to the invention<br>
comprises the signal model being determined on the basis of a<br>
sine function or a cosine function with a constant period and<br>
its respective harmonics, a decaying exponential function or a<br>
sine function with a decaying exponential function as an<br>
envelope curve. This advantageously allows the respective<br>
predicted value to be determined particularly quickly, since no<br>
other calculations need be carried out.<br><br>
PCT/DE 2003/003862	 4 -<br>
2002F11723WOIN <br>
A further solution for the object mentioned above comprises <br>
on the basis of the method of the type mentioned initially <br>
the digital data values being obtained, according to the<br>
invention from periodic signals and at least that digital data<br>
value which was recorded one period befor the current digital<br>
data value being used as the respective predicted value<br>
associated with the respective current digital data value. The<br>
required computation power can advantageously be kept low by<br>
the use for the predicted value of the respective date value<br>
recorded one period before a current data value. No additional<br>
computations tieed be carried, out, so that the method can be<br>
carried out at high speed.<br>
In order to improve the accuracy of the respective predicted<br>
value, it is also possible. to use, in addition, to the digital<br>
data value recorded precisely one period before the respective<br>
current digital data value, further digital data values, which.<br>
were recorded an integer number of periods before the<br>
respective carrent digital data value, in order to form the<br>
respective predicted value. These can be linked to one another<br>
by simple mathematical functions, such as averaging and/or<br>
weighting, so that the computation power required for this<br>
purpose can be kept low.<br>
One advantageous further development of the method according to<br>
the invention also provides that, in the RICE method, an<br>
overflow, which is determined by subtraction of a data length<br>
(which has been predicted by means of a RICE prediction value;<br>
of the respective current difference value and a current data<br>
length of this difference value, is. compared with a limit value<br>
which can be predetermined, and the difference value is"emitted<br>
with a predetermined maximum data length as a compressed value<br><br>
PCT/DE 2003/003862 	- 5 -<br>
2002F11723WOIN <br>
if the overflow exceeds the limit value. The major advantage of<br>
this development is that, in the case of successive difference<br>
values whose data length fluctuates to a major extent, the RICE<br>
method is used only when it can be used effectively, that is to<br>
say with Little overflow. If there is a. large overflow, the<br>
respective compressed value is emitted with a maximum<br>
predetermined data length.<br>
Furthermore, one advantageous further development of the method<br>
according to the invention provides that the compressed values<br>
are transmitted via a data transmission path, and the<br>
difference values are then recovered from the compressed values<br>
using a RICE decpding method, and the digital data values are<br>
determined from the difference values and the respective<br>
predicted values by addition using a reverse predictor method.<br>
Transmission of the compressed measurement values via a data<br>
transmission path in this case covers both wire-based<br>
transmission methods and wireless transmission methods, such as<br>
radio transmissions, According to this development,<br>
decompression. of the compressed values can advantageously be<br>
carried out at a point which is remote from the point at which<br>
they were compressed. For example, the compressed value can be<br>
transmitted from an in-field appliance in an industrial plant<br>
via a data bus to a central computer, which evaluates the<br>
digital data values once the compressed values have been<br>
decompressed.<br>
In order to simplify subsequent processing of the compressed<br>
values or to transmit additional information, one preferred<br>
embodiment of the invention allows the compressed Values to be<br>
provided with header data.<br><br>
PCT/DE 2003/003862 	- 6 -<br>
2002F11723WOIN <br>
According to a further advantageous embodiment of the method<br>
according to the invention, the data values are formed from<br>
input measurement variables from in-field appliances. In this<br>
context, by way of example, in-field appliances are protective<br>
or control appliances such as those which are normally used in<br>
industrial, for example energy, chemical or petrochemical<br>
plant. In comparison to audio technology, in which a virtually<br>
indefinite time is available for compression of the digital<br>
data values, the comparison prscess in in-field appliances<br>
must be carried out particularly quickly, owing to the<br>
restricted computation and storage capacities. The method<br>
according to the invention can thus be used particularly<br>
advantageously in this case.<br>
Protective and/or control appliances in energy plant can also<br>
advantageously be used as in-field appliances.<br>
The invention will be explained, in more detail in the following<br>
text using exemplary embodiments. In this case, in the figures:<br>
Figure 1 shows a schematic illustration in order to explain a<br>
method for compression of the digital data values;<br>
and<br>
Figure 2 shows a schematic illustration in order to explain a<br>
method for decompression of compressed- digital data<br>
values.<br>
Figure 1 shows a schematic illustration in order to explain a<br>
method for compression, using digital data values which have<br>

PCT/DE 2003/003862		-7-<br>
2002F11723WOIN<br>
Since the digital data values in the present exemplary<br>
embodiment are intended to be formed from (analog) input<br>
measurement variables of the in-field appliance, they are<br>
referred to in the following text as digital measurement data.<br>
A measurement device 1 is used to record measurement values,<br>
which are converted to digital measurement data in the normal<br>
way. First of all, a predictor method is carried out in order<br>
to process the digital measurement data. The predictor method<br>
is part of a. processing process for compression of the digital<br>
measurement data. in this case, predicted values for the<br>
digital measurement data are determined by means of a predictor<br>
device 2.<br>
The predictor method first of all reduces the data length (the<br>
number of bits) which is required to represent the digital<br>
measurement data, by forming difference values by subtraction<br>
from the digital measurement data and suitable predicted<br>
values. The predicted values that are used should in this case<br>
be as close as possible to the real digital measurement data,<br>
so that the difference values which result from the subtraction<br>
process are as small as possible. The further processing is<br>
then carried out using difference values whose required data<br>
length is considerably less than that of the digital<br>
measurement data.<br>
The predicted values for the predictor method can be formed<br>
using a signal modal which, for example, is based, on a sine<br>
function or a cosine function, as well as their respective<br>
harmonics, a decaying exponential function or a sine function<br>
with a decaying exponential function as an envelope curve. In<br>
this case, these are in each case functions which are<br>
represented and processed computationally with little effort.<br><br>
PCT/DE 2003/003862 		-8-<br>
2002F11723WOIN <br>
and are in some cases periodic. Previous digital measurement<br>
data which has been recorded before the digital measurement<br>
data to be compressed at that time is taken into account in the<br>
creation of the signal model for determination of the predicted<br>
models. Characteristic properties, such as the amplitude,<br>
period duration and decay behavior, of the previous digital<br>
measurement data ace used to form the signal model. Properties<br>
such as these can be calculated by simple computation<br>
operations and nevertheless allow the predicted values to be<br>
determined relatively reliably.<br>
In the simplest case, the previous digital measurement data.<br>
from precisely one previous recording period can be adopted<br>
unchanged as predicted values. The most recently described<br>
procedure, in which reference is made to a previous recording<br>
period, is particularly feasible when the recorded measurement<br>
values and thus the digital measurement data have or has a<br>
periodic behavior, as is frequently the case, for example, in<br>
energy plant. When the digital measurement data is processed<br>
for the first time using the predictor method, a start value<br>
must be provided for the first predicted value.<br>
As is shown in Figure 1, the digital measurement data is<br>
transmitted (10) from the measurement device 1 and the<br>
respective determined predicted values are transmitted (20)<br>
from the predictor apparatus 2 to a subtraction device 3,<br>
respectively, in which the predicted values are subtracted from<br>
the respectively associated digital measurement data. The<br>
subtraction process results in difference values, which are<br>
then passed (30) to on apparatus A in order to carry out a RICE<br>
method.<br><br>
PCT/DE 2003/003862 	- 9 -<br>
2002F11723WOIN <br>
In the RICE method, which ia known per se and whose details can<br>
be found from the references by a person skilled in the art<br>
(see, for example, http://WWW.monkeysaudio,com/theory.html<br>
[called up on November 13, 2002], the data length of the<br>
difference values which are produced by the predictor method<br>
are reduced, so that, in the end, compressed values are<br>
produced and emitted (40) .<br>
The same data length could, in each case, be used for<br>
transmission and storage of the difference values. These would<br>
have to correspond at Least to the maximum, possible data length<br>
of a difference value. However, since the required data length<br>
is generally not constant in the case of successive difference<br>
values, but can fluctuate from one difference value to the<br>
next, a not inconsiderable amount of memory space would the<br>
wasted for the transmission and storage of the difference<br>
values with the maximum data length. This will be explained in<br>
more detail using the following example: let us assumed that<br>
three digitally represented difference values are to be<br>
transmitted, to be precise 11010110, 1101 and 10110. If a<br>
constant date length were used for transmission, the maximum<br>
occurring data length of the difference values would have to be<br>
used, that is to say in this case 8 (data length of first<br>
difference value}. In consequence, the three difference values<br>
would have to be transmitted in the form<br>
110101100000110100010110. The zeroes which are inserted in the<br>
maximum data length for transmission of the smaller difference<br>
values (1101, 10110) waste unnecessary memory space, since no<br>
additional in format ion is transmitted.<br>
The RICE method now provides an algorithmic method for<br>
scrambled difference values which result from the predictor<br>
method in a suitable manner, that is to say in a manner which<br><br>
PCT/DE 2003/003862		- 10 -<br>
2002F11723WOIN <br>
is optimized with regard to memory space, to form compressed<br>
values. The basic idea for the RICE method is the compression<br>
of the difference values using a data Length which is matched<br>
to the respective difference value. A so-called RICE code is<br>
introduced in order to separate successive compressed values,<br>
which are obtained from the difference values, and in order to<br>
scramble information which it may possibly not be possible to<br>
represent with an excessively small data length. This will be<br>
explained for the following text.<br>
The BICE method requires a RICE predicted value for the<br>
expected data length of the respective subsequent difference<br>
value. The compressed values which are produced by means of the<br>
RICE method are then in general stored using the data length<br>
predicted by means of the RICE predicted value. If the data<br>
length of the difference values which are produced using the<br>
previous predictor method is greater than the data length<br>
predicted using the RICE predicted value, the overflow (the<br>
most significant bits which can no longer be represented in the<br>
predicted data length} are scrambled in the RICE code. The RICE<br>
code comprises a number of binary values 0, with this number<br>
resulting directly from the overflow, and a final binary value<br>
1. The RICE code and a resultant value which is obtained, taking<br>
into account the predicted data length from the respective<br>
difference value, are attached directly to one another, in<br>
order to obtain a compressed value.<br>
The RICE, predicted value for the data length is obtained from<br>
the values for the data length of a specific number of previous<br>
digital measurement data items, in which case these may be<br>
weighted differently as a function of the time interval from<br><br>
PCT/DE 2003/003862 	- 11 -<br>
2002F11723WOIN <br>
the RICE predicted value to be estimated at that time.<br>
If the discrepancies between the actual data length of the<br>
respective data value and the data length predicted using the<br>
RICE predicted value are too great, the RICE method becomes<br>
ineffective. For this reason; the RICE method is used only up<br>
to a specific difference between the predicted data length and<br>
the actual data length. If this limit value is exceeded in the<br>
method, a maximum data length is used rather than the RICE<br>
predicted value. The fact that the limit value has been<br>
exceeded is identified by a particular value in the RICE codes,<br>
which cannot normally occur (limit value not exceeded).<br>
In order to explain the compression method further, the<br>
following text refers to three successive difference values<br>
which, by way of example, can be represented as a numerical<br>
sequence of a first binary value, (ll00lll0110) , of a second<br>
binary value (10110) and of a third binary value (1101111). The<br>
RICE predicts valve for the data length 15 obtained from the<br>
data length of the respective previous difference value of the<br>
corresponding binary value. The limit value or the maximum<br>
permissible difference between the actual data length of the<br>
respective binary value and the predicted RICE predicted value<br>
is assumed to be 4, with the maximum data length that can be<br>
transmitted being assumed to be 16. These assumptions result in<br>
the situation illustrated in Table 1 when the first binary<br>
value is transmitted with its actual data length.<br><br><br><br>
PCT/DE 2003/003862	- 13 -<br>
2002F11723WOIN<br>
The bit sequence for the second and the third binary value is<br>
thus 100000G10110 00101111, For comparison purposes, it should<br>
be mentioned that the bit sequence for the second and the third<br>
binary value without the use of the RICE method but using the<br>
maximum data length that occurs (11, the data length of the<br>
first binary value) would have been 000000l0ll0 0000ll0llll,<br>
that is to say 22 bits, instead of the 20 bits produced by<br>
means of the RICE method.<br>
Figure 2 shows a schematic illustration, in order to explain a<br>
decompression method. In this case, the method explained in<br>
conjunction with Figure 1 is carried out in the reverse<br>
sequence. The compressed values are supplied (100) to a RICE<br>
apparatus 20. The difference values are recovered as the result<br>
of the RICE decoding method which can be carried out using the<br>
RICE apparatus 20, and the difference values are joined<br>
together (200) and (300), respectively, in an addition<br>
apparatus 21 with the predicted values for the predictor<br>
method, which are produced by means of a predictor apparatus<br>
22, so that, in the end, the digital measurement data is<br>
emitted once again (400) . The start values for the pradicted<br>
values for the decompression process (see Figure 2) must either<br>
be agreed as fixed with the predicted values for the<br>
compression process (see Figure 1) , or must be transmitted<br>
together with the compressed values.<br>
In order to optimize the processing of the compressed values<br>
for practical applications in industrial plant, in particular<br>
energy plant, it is possible to provide for the compressed<br>
values to be provided with header values. The header data may,<br>
for example, comprise information about a data length of the<br>
difference values, the number of the difference values, a type<br>
and parameter of the respective predicted value for the<br>
predictor method, as well as a type and parameter of the<br><br>
PCT/DE 2003/003862 	- 14 -<br>
2002F11723WOIN <br>
respective RICE predicted value for the data length (RICE<br>
coding method). Furthermore, information may be included about<br>
the start values of the predicted values for the predictor<br>
method, and/or of the RICE, predicted value.<br>
The compression process with the aid of the method described in<br>
conjunction with Figure 1 can expediently be carried out<br>
immediately after the recording of the digital measurement<br>
values, in real time. Decompression of the compressed values<br>
can then advantageously be carried out for further use shortly<br>
before being used, in which case the (decompressed) digital<br>
measurement data can be used, for example, for display or<br>
simulation purposes.<br><br>

or a sine function with a decaying exponential function as<br>
an envelope curve.<br>
3. A method for processing digital data values, in which a<br>
predictor method is used to form a difference value from<br>
the respective current digital data value and from a<br>
respective predicted value, and compressed values are<br>
produced from the difference values using a RICE method<br>
which follows the predictor method,<br>
characterised in that<br>
the digital data values are obtained from periodic signals<br>
and at least that digital data value which was recorded<br>
one period before the current digital data value is used<br>
as the respective predicted value associated with the<br>
respective current digital data value.<br><br>
PCT/DE 2003/003862 	- 16 -<br>
2002F11723WOIN <br>
4. The method as claimed in one of the preceding claims,<br>
characterired in that,<br>
in the RICE method, an overflow, which is determined by<br>
subtraction of a data length (which has been predicted by<br>
means of a RICE prediction value) of the respective<br>
current difference value and a current data length of this<br>
difference value, is compared with a limit value which can<br>
be predetermined, and the difference value is emitted with<br>
a predetermined maximum data length as a compressed value<br>
if the overflow exceeds the limit value.<br>
5.	The method as claimed in one of the preceding claims,<br>
characterized in that<br>
the compressed values are transmitted via a data<br>
transmission pathy and the difference values are then<br>
recovered from the compressed values using a RlCE decoding<br>
method, and the digital data values are determined from<br>
the difference values and the respective predicted values<br>
by addition using a reverse predictor method.<br>
6.	The method as claimed in one of the preceding claims,.<br>
characterised in that<br>
the compressed digital measurement data is provided with<br>
header data,<br>
7.	The method as claimed in one of the preceding claims,<br>
characterized in that<br>
the digital data values are formed from input measurementt<br>
variables from in-field equipment.<br><br>
PCT/DE 2003/003862 	- 17 -<br>
2002F11723WOIN <br>
8.	The method as claimed in claim 7,<br>
characterized in that<br>
protective and/or control appliances in energy,<br>
installations are used as in-field appliances.<br><br><br>
The invention relates to a method for processing digital data valued according; to which a diffirential value is formed<br>
from a respective current digital data value and a respective predicted value with the aid of a predictor method, compressed 12 ves<br>
being generated from thedifferential valuse in a Rice process that succeeds the predictor method. The aim of the invention is to 12 Ty<br>
out said method relatively rapidly. To achieve this, the respective predicted value is obtained using a signal model, which discover<br>
the expected temporal progression of the digital data values.</td>
