				<td>This invenη on relates to a process for the polymerizaη on of an olefin monomer, or of an olefin monomer and a supported olefin polymerizaη on catalyst system.<br>
Recently there have been a number of advances in the producη on of polyolefin copolymers due to the introducη on of metallocene catalysts. Metallocene catalysts offer a number of advantages including improved acη vity compared to tradiη onal Ziegler catalysts under a given set of condiη ons. Also, metallocene catalysts are often described as being single-site in nature. Because of this single-site nature, the polyolefins produced with these catalysts are often very uniform in their molecular structure.<br>
In order for metallocene catalysts to be commercially useful as supported catalysts in a gas phase, soluη on or slurry process, the catalysts employed preferably are highly acη ve. High producη vity of the catalyst in a polymerizaη on processes is desired to reduce catalyst costs and to avoid the expense of catalyst residue removal procedures. Thus, the catalyst residue in the polymer must be low enough that it can be left in the polymer without causing any undue problems to either the resin manufacturer, or to a party fabricaη ng arη cles from the resin, or to an ulη mate user of such fabricated arη cles. When a highly acη ve catalyst is used in a gas phase, soluη on or slurry process, the transiη on metal content of the polymer should be on the order of less than 1 part per million (ppm) of transiη on metal at a producη vity level of greater than 1,000,000 pounds of polymer per pound of transiη on metal.<br>
One of the features of a gas phase polymerizaη on reactor is that the gas velocity in the reactor is limited to prevent excess carry-over of the solid parη cles from the fluid bed, which would happen if the velocity is set too high. If the gas velocity is set too<br><br>
low, reactor fouling may occur due to fallout of polymer from the bed. Since the gas velocity is limited, the amount of heat which can be removed when operaη ng at a given set of condiη ons is also limited. The limitaη ons on heat removal place limitaη ons on the rate of producη vity for a given reactor. Attempts at improving the producη vity of a gas phase reactor by increasing the catalyst feed rate will often not be met with success because of the heat removal limitaη ons of the reactor.<br>
A major improvement in reactor output and a parη al soluη on to the heat removal limitaη ons is described in U.S. 4,543,399; U.S. 5,352,749; EP 89691; WO 94/25495 and WO 94/28032, which are hereby incorporated by reference, where a volaη le liquid is fed to the reactor. The volaη le liquid evaporates in the hot fluidized bed to form a gas which mixes with the fluidizing gas. The evaporated liquid exits the top of the reactor as part of the recycle gas and passes through the heat exchange part of the recycle loop. The evaporated liquid condenses in the heat exchanger and is thei feed to the reactor as a volaη le liquid.<br>
In pracη ce, in the gas phase commercial copolymers are made using monomer having 2 to 8 carbon atoms because of the lower concentraη ons possible in the reacto for alpha-oleflns with greater carbon numbers. Tradiη onal Ziegler catalysts are not parη cularly efficient or effecη ve at incorporaη ng the alpha-olefin comonomers having greater numbers of carbon atoms into the polymer. To date, highly acη ve and highly efficient supported metallocene catalysts, which do have high rates of alpha-olefin ;omonomer incorporaη on into the polymer, have not been demonstrated.<br>
Up to now, supported metallocene catalysts useful for producing polyolefin η omopolymers and copolymers in gas phase and slurry processes have had reported catalyst efficiencies of less than 50,000,000 grams polymer/mole catalyst/hour for Zr based catalysts and 24,000,000 grams polymer/mole catalyst/hour for η  based catalysts except when used with excepη onally high raη os of cocatalyst to catalyst. A variety of metallocene loadings and catalyst concentraη ons have been reported with no obvious trends. Indeed, due to the nonuniformity in the convenη ons used to report the data, and imprecision in the definiη ons of various terms in the disclosures, there appears to be little relaη onship between the use of various classes of metallocene complexes or any opη mal ranges for the various process variables employed.<br><br>
where the catalyst system is used at a catalyst concentraη on in the range of from about 0.01 to about 6 moles of acη ve catalyst/mole of monomer, and a catalyst efficiency results that is at least 2.4 x 10? g polymer/g mol catalyst/hour.<br>

In general, the catalyst system can be prepared by combining the catalyst components in any order in a suitable solvent at a temperature within the range from about "100°C to about 300°C or by generaη ng the acη vated catalyst electrochemically as previously explained, followed by wet or dry deposiη on and impregnaη on of the support material component. Alternaη vely, the metallocene complex component and the acη vator component may be individually deposited on the support material component in any order, opη onally with individual solvent removal and/or drying. The acη vated catalyst may be separately prepared prior to use by combining the respecη ve components. The catalyst and cocatalyst as well as acη vated catalyst system generally are sensiη ve to both moisture and oxygen and should be handled and transferred in an inert atmosphere.<br>
The catalyst system of this invenη on is produced from catalyst components comprising a support material component. Especially suited support materials for the support material component of the catalyst system include polymers, inorganic oxides, metal halides, prepolymerized polymeric substrates or a mixture thereof,) A preferred group of support materials is inorganic oxides and includes silica, alumina, silica-alumina, or a mixture thereof. Other suitable support materials include silica, alumina, silica-alumina, or a mixture thereof which has been modified with η C2, B2O3, or a mixture thereof!, Suitable supported catalyst systems are readily prepared by contacη ng the present metal complexes with the substrate, opη onally while subjecη ng the mixture to heaη ng and/or reduced pressures.<br>
Preferred supports for use in the present invenη on include highly porous silicas,<br>
aluminas, aluminosilicates, and mixtures thereof. The most preferred support material<br>
is silica. The support material may be in granular, agglomerated, pelleη zed, or any<br>
other physical form. Suitable materials include, but are not limited to, silicas available<br>

"	Supports suitable for the present invenη on preferably have a surface area as<br>
determined by nitrogen porosimetry using the B.E.T. method from 10 to about 1000<br><br>
m2/g, and preferably from about 100 to 600 nrVg. The pore volume of the support, as determined by nitrogen adsorpη on, advantageously is between 0.1 and 3 cm2/g, preferably from about 0.2 to 2 cm2/g. The average parη cle size is not criη cal, but typically is from 3.5 to 500 urn, preferably from 1 to 100 urn.<br>
Both silica and alumina are known to inherently possess small quanη η es of hydroxyl funcη onality attached thereto. When used as a support herein, these materials are preferably subjected to a heat treatment and/or chemical treatment to reduce the hydroxyl content thereof. Typical heat treatments are carried out at a temperature from 30°C to 1000°C for a duraη on of 10 minutes to 50 hours in air or an inert atmosphere or under reduced pressure. Typical chemical treatments include contacη ng with Lewis acid alkylaη ng agents such as trihydrocarbyl aluminum compounds, trihydrocarbylchlorosilane compounds, trihydrocarbylalkoxysilane compounds or similar agents. Preferred silica or alumina materials for use herein have a surface hydroxyl content that is less than 0.8 mmol of hydroxyl groups per gram of solid support, more preferably less than 0.5 mmol per gram. The hydroxyl content may be determined by adding an excess of dialkyl magnesium to a slurry of the solid support and determining the amount of dialkyl magnesium remaining in soluη on via known techniques. This method is based on the reacη on:<br>
S-OH + Mg(Alk)2 --&gt; S-OMg(Alk) + (Alk)H, wherein S is the solid support, and Alk is a C 1.4 alkyl group.<br>
The support may be unfuncη onalized (excepη ng for hydroxyl groups as previously discussed) or funcη onalized by treaη ng with a silane or chlorosilane funcη onalizing agent to attach thereto pendant silane -(Si-R)=, or chlorosilane -(Si-Cl)= funcη onality, wherein R is a C\.\Q hydrocarbyl group. Suitable funcη onalizing agents are compounds that react with surface hydroxyl groups of the support or react with the silicon or aluminum of the matrix. Examples of suitable funcη onalizing agents include phenylsilane, diphenylsilane, methylphenylsilane, dimethylsilane, diethylsilane, cUorofrimethylsilane, hexamethyldisilazane, dichlorosilane, and dichlorodimethylsilane. Techniques for forming such funcη onalized silica or alumina compounds were previously disclosedin U.S. Patent No."s 3,687,920 and 3,879,368, the teachings of which are herein incorporated by reference.<br><br>
The support may also be treated with an aluminum component selected from an alumoxane or an aluminum compound of the formula AIR3, wherein R independently each occurrence is hydride or R1, and R1 is Cj_4 alkyl. Preferably, the aluminum component is selected from the group consisη ng of aluminoxanes and tris(Cj.4 alkyl)aluminum compounds. Most preferred aluminum components are aluminoxanes, trimethylaluminum, triethylaluminum, tri-isobutylaluminum, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Alumoxanes (also referred to as aluminoxanes) are oligomeric or polymeric aluminum oxy compounds containing chains of alternaη ng aluminum and oxygen atoms, whereby the aluminum carries a subsη tuent, preferably an alkyl group. The structure of alumoxane has been believed to be represented by the following general formulae (-A1CR1 )-0)m", for a cyclic alumoxane, and R2Al-CK-AKR2-OJm"-AlR2, for a linear compound, wherein Rl is Cj_4 alkyl, and m" is an integer ranging from 1 to about 50, preferably at least about 4. Alumoxanes are typically the reacη on products of water and an alkylaluminum compound, which in addiη on to an alkyl group may contain halide or alkoxide groups. Reacη ng a mixture of several different alkylaluminum compounds, such as for example trimethylaluminum and tri-isobutylaluminum, with water yields so-called modified or mixed alumoxanes. Preferred alumoxanes are methylalumoxane and methylalumoxane modified with minor amounts of C2-4 alkyl groups, especially isobutyl groups. Alumoxanes generally contain minor to substanη al amounts of starη ng alkylaluminum compound.<br>
Parη cular techniques for the preparaη on of alumoxane type compounds by contacη ng an alkylaluminum compound with an inorganic salt containing water of crystallizaη on are disclosed in US-A-4,542,119. In a parη cular preferred embodiment, an alkylaluminum compound is contacted with a regeneratable water-containing substance such as hydrated alumina, silica or other substance. This is disclosed in EP-A-338,044. Thus the alumoxane may be incorporated into the support by reacη on orThyalufelfaluminaor silica material, which has opη onally been funcη onalized with silane, siloxane. hydrocarbyloxysilane, or chlorosilane groups, with a tris(Ci_io alkyl) aluminum compound according to known techniques. For the teachings contained therein the foregoing patents and publicaη ons, or their corresponding equivalent United States applicaη ons, are hereby incorporated by reference.<br><br>
The treatment of the support material in order to include opη onal alumoxane or trialkylaluminum loadings involves contacη ng the same with an alumoxane or trialkylaluminum compound before, after, or simultaneously with addiη on of the complex or acη vated catalyst. Opη onally the mixture can also be heated under an inert atmosphere for a period and at a temperature sufficient to fix the alumoxane, trialkylaluminum compound, complex or catalyst system to the support. Opη onally, the treated support component containing alumoxane or the trialkylaluminum compound may be subjected to one or more wash steps, using toluene or similar solvent, to remove excess alumoxane, trialkylaluminum, or any other soluble aluminum compound that is not fixed to the support.<br>
Besides contacη ng the support with alumoxane, the alumoxane may be generated in situ by contacη ng an unhydrolyzed silica or alumina or a moistened silica or alumina with a trialkyl aluminum compound opη onally in the presence of an inert diluent. Such a process is well known in the art, having been disclosed in EP-A-250,600, U.S.-A-4,912,075, and U.S.-A-5,008,228, the teachings of which, or of the corresponding U. S. applicaη on, are hereby incorporated by reference.

Most preferably, the diluent is an aromaη c hydrocarbon, especially toluene. After preparaη on in the foregoing manner the residual hydroxyl content thereof is desirably reduced to a level less than 1.0 meq of OH per gram of support, by any of the previously disclosed techniques.<br>

These aluminum compounds are usefully employed for their beneficial ability to scavenge impuriη es such as oxygen, water, and aldehydes from the polymerizaη on<br><br>
mixture.

An important factor in realizing high efficiencies with the catalyst system of this invenη on is the range of catalyst loadings, that is, the amount of the metallocene complex component based on the molar amount of the central metal of the complex relaη ve to the weight of the support material component. Desirably, the metallocene complex component is used in a loading range of from about 0.1 to about 25 nmol/gram of support material component, preferably, from about 0.3 to about 20 Hmol/gram of support material component, more preferably, from about 1 to about 20 Hmol/gram of support material component.<br>
In most polymerizaη on reacη ons the molar raη o of catalyst to polymerizable compounds employed is from 10"*2; 1 to 10"1: 1, more preferably from 10" 2; l to 10"5:1.<br>

The supported catalysts in any of the processes of this invenη on, whether gas phase, slurry, or any other polymerizaη on process, may be used to polymerize addiη onal polymerizable monomers including ethylenically unsaturated monomers, acetylenic compounds, conjugated or nonconjugated dienes, polyenes, and mixtures thereof. Preferred monomers include olefins, for example, a-olefins having from 2 to 100,000, preferably from 2 to 30, more preferably from 2 to 8 carbon atoms and combinaη ons of two or more of such a-olefins.<br>

Preferably, the a-olefins are ethylene, propene, 1-butene, 4-methyl-pentene-1, 1-hexene, 1-octene, and combinaη ons of ethylene and/or propene with one or more of such other a-olefins.

Long chain macromolecular a-olefins can be vinyl terminated polymeric remnants formed in situ during conη nuous soluη on polymerizaη on reacη ons, and in some other polymerizaη on reacη ons, such as gas phase polymerizaη on reacη ons. Under suitable process condiη ons such long chain macromolecular units may be polymerized into the polymer product along with ethylene and other short chain olefin monomers to give small quanη η es of long chain branching in the resulη ng polymer.<br>
In general, the polymerizaη on may be accomplished under condiη ons well known in the prior art for Ziegler-Natta or Kaminsky-Sinn type polymerizaη on reacη ons. Suspension, soluη on, slurry, gas phase or high pressure, whether employed in batch or conη nuous form or other process condiη ons, may be employed if desired. Examples of such well known polymerizaη on processes are depicted in WO 88/02009, U.S. Patent Nos. 5,084,534; 5,405,922; 4,588,790; 5,032,652; 4,543,399; 4,564,647; 4,522,987, which are incorporated herein by reference; and elsewhere. Preferred polymerizaη on temperatures are from 0-250°C. Preferred polymerizaη on pressures are from atmospheric to 3000 atmospheres.<br>
In a highly desirable embodiment, the processes of this invenη on are performed in a single reactor, which may have a single reacη on vessel or two or more vessels producing essenη ally the same polyolefin copolymer composiη on. Thus, in this embodiment, the polymerizaη on processes of this invenη on do not produce blends, or where more than one reacη on vessel is used do not require blending to produce essenη ally homogeneous polyolefin copolymer composiη ons. Alternaη vely, the catalyst system may employ more than one metallocene complex, or even a nonmetallocene component, to produce reactor blends.<br>
In an important aspect of this invenη on, which contributes to the high catalyst efficiencies obtainable with the catalyst system of this invenη on, it is desirable that the catalyst system is used at a catalyst concentraη on in the range of about 0.01 x 10"" to about 6 x 10"6 moles acη ve catalyst/mole monomer, more desirably, at a catalyst concentraη on in the range of about 0.01 x 10"6 to about 5.0 x 10"6 moles acη ve catalyst/mole monomer, preferably, at a catalyst concentraη on in the range of about 0.02 x 10"6 to about 3.0 x 10-6 moles acη ve catalyst/mole monomer, more preferably, at a catalyst concentraη on in the range of about 0.05 x 10-6 to about 3.0 x 10-6 moles<br><br>
acη ve catalyst/mole monomer, and sη ll more preferably, at a catalyst concentraη on in the range of about 0.1 x 10"6 to about 3.0 x 10-6 moles acη ve catalyst/mole monomer. Acη ve catalyst is defined in this context as the central metal of the metallocene complex of the metallocene complex component of the catalyst system.<br>
Use of the catalyst system of this invenη on in the polymerizaη on process thereof results in a catalyst efficiency that is at least 24,000,000 g polymer/mole catalyst/hour, desirably, at least 48,000,000 g polymer/mole catalyst/hour, more desirably, at least 72,000,000 g polymer/mole catalyst/hour, even better, at least 96,000,000 g polymer/mole catalyst/hour, sη ll better, at least 144,000,000 g polymer/mole catalyst/hour, even better than that, at least 240,000,000 g polymer/mole catalyst/hour, better sη ll, at least 384,000,000 g polymer/mole catalyst/hour. As used in relaη onship to the term "catalyst efficiency", the mass of polymer, in grams, refers to the mass of polymer produced in the polymerizaη on process relaη ve to the mass, in moles, of the acη ve catalyst required per hour. If the catalyst system is employed in one of the alternaη ve methods described herein, the mass of the catalyst system is simply the sum of the masses of the catalyst components.<br>
The polymerizaη on process of this invenη on may be conducted under those generally useful for slurry polymerizaη on processes. A descripη on of the slurry process can be found in Volume 6 of the Encyclopedia of Polymer Science and Engineering (John Wiley and Sons) pages 472 to 477 (1986).<br>
By conducη ng the slurry polymerizaη on under appropriately controlled reacη on condiη ons, the polymer being formed around the solid catalyst system is not melted or dissolved during the polymerizaη on reacη on, but maintains a discrete form, which, preferably, is a granular or powdery form during the reacη on.<br>
When a polymerizaη on reacη on is conducted under slurry process condiη ons, the polymerizaη on pressure is generally from 1 to 100 atm, preferably from 3 to 30 atm, and the polymerizaη on temperature is generally from 20 to 115 °C, preferably from 50 to 105 °C. However, the upper limit of the polymerizaη on temperature is a temperature above which the polymer produced does not maintain its discrete state, and this varies depending on the type and density of the polymer produced and the type of diluent used.<br><br>
As a diluent to be used for slurry polymerizaη on, typical inert aliphaη c or aromaη c hydrocarbon solvents can be suitably used, including xylene, benzene, toluene, isobutane, isopentane, heptane, hexane and octane. Hexane, isobutane and isopentane are especially preferred.<br>
In producing a polymer by the process of this invenη on under slurry condiη ons, the molecular weight can be controlled by changing the concentraη on of hydrogen in the reacη on system or by changing the polymerizaη on temperature, as described in EP 69951, DE 3127133.2, and U.S. 4,542,199 which are hereby incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The process of the present invenη on can be employed to advantage jn thejas phase polymerizaη on and copolymerizaη on of olefins. Gas phase processes for the polymerizaη on of olefins, especially the homopolymerizaη on and copolymerizaη on of ethylene and propylene, and the copolymerizaη on of ethylene with higher a-olefins such as, for example, 1-butene, 1-hexene, 4-methyl-l-pentene, are well known in the art.<br>
The gas phase process employed can be, for example, of the type which employs a mechanically sη rred bed or a gas fluidized bed as the polymerizaη on reacη on zone. Preferred is the process wherein the polymerizaη on reacη on is carried out in a verη cal cylindrical polymerizaη on reactor containing a fluidized bed of polymer parη cles supported above a perforated plate, fluidizaη on grid, by a flow of fluidizaη on gas.<br>
The gas employed to fluidize the bed comprises the monomer or monomers to be polymerized, and also serves as a heat exchange medium to remove the heat of reacη on from the bed. The hot gases emerge from the top of the reactor, normally via a tranquilizaη on zone, also known as a velocity reducη on zone, having a wider diameter than the fluidized bed and wherein fine parη cles entrained in the gas stream have an opportunity to gravitate back into the bed. It can also be advantageous to use a cyclone to remove ultra-fine parη cles from the hot gas stream. The gas is then normally recycled to the bed by means of a blower or compressor and one or more heat exchangers to strip the gas of the heat of polymerizaη on.<br><br>
A preferred method of cooling the bed, in addiη on to the cooling provided by the cooled recycle gas, is to feed a volaη le liquid to the bed to provide an evaporaη ve cooling effect. The volaη le liquid employed in this case can be, for example, a volaη le inert liquid, for example, a saturated hydrocarbon having about 3 to about 8, preferably 4 to 6, carbon atoms. In the case that the monomer or comonomer itself is a volaη le liquid, or can be condensed to provide such a liquid, this can suitably be fed to the bed to provide an evaporaη ve cooling effect. Examples of olefin monomers which can be employed in this manner are olefins containing about three to about eight, preferably three to six carbon atoms. The volaη le liquid evaporates in the hot fluidized bed to form gas which mixes with the fluidizing gas. If the volaη le liquid is a monomer or comonomer, it will undergo some polymerizaη on in the bed. The evaporated liquid then emerges from the reactor as part of the hot recycle gas, and enters the compression/heat exchange part of the recycle loop. The recycle gas is cooled in the heat exchanger and, if the temperature to which the gas is cooled is below the dew point, liquid will precipitate from the gas. This liquid is desirably recycled conη nuously to the fluidized bed. It is possible to recycle the precipitated liquid to the bed as liquid droplets carried in the recycle gas stream. This type of process is described, for example in EP 89691; U.S. 4,543,399; WO 94/25495 and U.S. 5,352,749, which are hereby incorporated by reference. A parη cularly preferred method of recycling the liquid to the bed is to separate the liquid from the recycle gas stream and to reinject this liquid directly into the bed, preferably using a method which generates fine droplets of the liquid within the bed. This type of process is described in BP Chemicals" WO 94/280322which is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
v The polymerizaη on reacη on occurring in the gas fluidized bed is catalyzed by the conη nuous or semi-conη nuous addiη on of the catalyst components of the catalyst system or of the catalyst system as a whole. In a highly desirable method of operaη on, the catalyst components are produced outside the reactor, the process comprising:<br>
1) deposiη ng one or more metallocene complexes on individual metallocene support porη ons of the support material component or on a common metallocene support to form one or more individually supported metallocene complex components;<br><br>
2)	deposiη ng one or more cocatalysts on individual cocatalyst support porη ons of the support material component or on a common cocatalyst support to form one or more individually supported cocatalyst components; and<br>
3)	combining together in any order one or more of the metallocene components from 1) and the cocatalyst components from 2) to form the catalyst system prior to introducη on of the catalyst system into the reactor; or<br>
4)	introducing one or more of the individually supported metallocene components from 1) and the individually supported cocatalyst components from 2) into the reactor individually.    J<br>
The polymer is produced directly in the fluidized bed by catalyzed copolymerizaη on of the monomer and one or more comonomers on the fluidized parη cles of catalyst, supported catalyst or prepolymer within the bed. Start-up of the polymerizaη on reacη on is achieved using a bed of preformed polymer parη cles, preferably similar to the target polyolefin, and condiη oning the bed by drying with inert gas or nitrogen prior to introducing the catalyst, the monomer(s) and any other gases which it is desired to have in the recycle gas stream, such as a diluent gas, hydrogen chain transfer agent, or an inert condensable gas when operaη ng in gas phase condensing mode. The produced polymer is discharged conη nuously or disconη nuously from the fluidized bed as desired. Such processes are used commercially on a large scale for the manufacture of high density polyethylene (HDPE), medium density polyethylene (MDPE), linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) and polypropylene.<br>
The gas phase processes suitable for the pracη ce of this invenη on are preferably conη nuous processes which provide for the conη nuous supply of reactants to the reacη on zone of the reactor and the removal of products from the reacη on zone of the reactor, thereby providing a steady-state environment on the macro scale in the reacη on zone of the reactor.<br>
Typically,Vthe fluidized bed of the gas phase process is operated at temperatures<br>

greater than 50°C, preferably, greater than about 60°C and from about 60°C to about 110°C, more preferably, greater than about 70°C and from about 70°C to about 110°C, even more preferably, greater than about 80°C.       )<br><br>
Typically the molar raη o of comonomer to monomer used in the polymerizaη on depeMs upon the desired density for the composiη on being produced and is about 0.5 or less. Desirably, where the polymerizaη on is a copolymerizaη on of ethylene or propylene as the monomer and of one or more a-olefm comonomers, the process of this invenη on employs a comonomer to monomer molar raη o which is less than 0.1, preferably less than 0.05, and more preferably less than 0.01.<br>

Desirably, when producing materials with a density range of from about 0.91 to about 0.93 the comonomer to monomer raη o is less than 0.2, preferably less than 0.05, even more preferably less than 0.02, and may even be less than 0.01. Typically, the raη o of hydrogen to monomer is less than about 0.5, preferably less than 0.2, more preferably less than 0.05, even more preferably less than 0.02 and may even be less than 0.01.<br>

Experimental<br>
The polymerizaη on examples which follow were carried out in a 13 liter gas phase reactor having a four inch diameter thirty inch long fluidizaη on zone and an eight inch diameter ten inch long velocity reducη on zone which are connected by a transiη on secη on having tapered walls. Typical operaη ng ranges are 40 to 100°C, 250 to 350 psia total pressure and up to 8 hours reacη on η me. Ethylene, comonomer, hydrogen and nitrogen enter the bottom of the reactor where they pass through a gas distributor plate. The flow of the gas is 2 to 8 η mes the minimum parη cle fluidizaη on velocity rFluidizaη on Engineering. 2nd Ed., D. Kunii and O. Levenspiel, 1991, Butterworth-Heinemann]. Most of the suspended solids disengage in the velocity reducη on zone. The reactant gases exit the top of the velocity reducη on zone and pass through a dust filter to remove any fines. The gases then pass through a gas booster pump. The polymer is allowed to accumulate in the reactor over the course of the reacη on. The total system pressure is kept constant during the reacη on by regulaη ng the flow of monomer into the reactor. Polymer is removed from the reactor to a recovery vessel by opening a valve located at the bottom of the fluidizaη on zone. The polymer recovery vessel is kept at a lower pressure than the reactor. The pressures of ethylene, comonomer and hydrogen reported refer to parη al pressures.<br>
The mode of reactor operaη on which was employed is referred to as semi-batch. The catalyst was prepared and loaded into a catalyst injector in an inert<br><br>
atmosphere glovebox. The injector was removed from the glovebox and inserted into the top of the reactor. Appropriate amounts of ethylene, 1-butene, hydrogen and nitrogen were introduced into the reactor to bring the total pressure to 300 psia. The catalyst was then injected and the polymer was usually allowed to form for 30 minutes. The total system pressure was kept constant during the reacη on by regulaη ng the flow of monomer into the reactor. After 30 minutes the reactor was empη ed and the polymer powder was collected.<br>
Several different silica pretreatment procedures were used. One pretreatment procedure involved first drying approximately 2 grams of the silica under a nitrogen purge at 200°C for several hours. The silica was removed from the drying oven and mixed with a quanη ty of disη lled water equal to 3 weight percent of the silica. The silica containing the water was shaken for about ten minutes to disperse the water evenly and to break up the lumps which formed on addiη on of the water. The silica was then brought into an inert atmosphere glovebox where in a toluene slurry it was then treated with triethyl aluminum (TEA) in a amount corresponding to an AI/H2O molar raη o of 2/1. The silica was then filtered and washed several η mes with toluene to remove any residual soluble aluminum compounds which may have resulted during the dehydraη on step. The supports were then dried under reduced pressure to give a free flowing powder.<br>
A second pretreatment procedure involved first drying approximately 5 grams of the silica under a nitrogen purge at 500°C for 4 hours. The silica was removed from the drying furnace and brought into an inert atmospheric glovebox where in a toluene slurry it was treated with TEA in an amount corresponding to an Al/OH raη o of 1/1. This corresponded to a TEA/silica raη o of 1.2 mmoles TEA/g silica. The silica was then filtered and washed several η mes with toluene to remove any residual soluble aluminum compounds which may have resulted during the dehydraη on step. The supports were then dried under reduced pressure to give a free flowing powder.<br>
Preparaη on of a typical supported catalyst involved first preparing 0.005 M soluη ons of (T|5-C5Me4SiMe2NCMe3)η (Me2) and of (T)5-C5Me4SiMe2NCMe3)η (s-trans- n.4-l,4-trans, trans-diphenyl-l,3-butadiene) and of (η 5-C5Me4SiMe2NCMe3)-η (ri4-C5H8) catalyst and borane ([B(C6F5)3l) cocatalyst<br>
in toluene. An appropriate amount (typically 100 to 300 ul) of toluene was added to the silica to pre-wet the support. An appropriate amount of the metallocene catalyst was then added to the silica followed by addition of an appropriate amount of the cocatalyst. The solvents were then removed under vacuum from the agitated slurry to give the catalyst as a free-flowing powder.<br>

Catalyst support preparation<br>
2 Grams of Davison type 948 silica was heated at 200°C for 4 hours in an inert stream of nitrogen. The silica was removed from the drying oven and mixed with 60 mg of distilled water (3 weight percent based on silica).

The silica was transferred into an inert atmosphere glovebox where it was then treated with TEA. The silica was suspended in an amount of dry toluene followed by the slow addition of 855 mg of TEA. The amount of TEA which was added corresponded to a water/TEA ratio of 1/2. The silica was then washed several times with toluene to remove any residual soluble aluminum compounds which may have resulted during the TEA treatment step. •<br>
