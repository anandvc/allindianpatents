				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to an audio-visual (AV) electronic secretary software<br>
suite used in a computer and particularly to an electronic calendar with<br>
automatic reminder and AV recording functions.<br>
2. Description of the prior art<br>
With the widespread usage of computers, electronic PC calendar software is<br>
used by the majority for managing personal schedules, meetings, and<br>
appointments. All in all, not everyone has the assistance of a responsible<br>
secretary, and even if a high-rank executive of a company is qualified to hire a<br>
personal secretary to help deal with schedules, some matters arc still ignored<br>
and mistakes arc made. Further, those 24-hour secretary assistance is never<br>
available, and the executive must still manage his or her appointments after<br>
business hours.<br>
In spite of general PC calendar software, such as Outlook, or a personal<br>
secretary, if the executive goes to other places on errands, the executive has to<br>
remember each day's schedules and meetings, where to meet with customers,<br>
and telephone numbers on his or her own. Therefore, the secretary actually<br>
helps the executive only during office hours but can do nothing after work on a<br>
holiday, or on a business trip. If the secretary is not very good or not<br>
particularly dedicated, then appointments with customers, important meetings,<br>
and schedules are not necessarily managed well.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, for a general electronic calendar software, for example,<br>
when a PC is booted, a plurality of functional blocks appear, such as a today<br>
timetable 11, a monthly calendar 12 of this month, a monthly calendar 13 of<br>
next month, a detailed work list 14. in which a user may set today's schedule in<br>
the today timetable 11 by selecting a specified time and keying in engagement<br>
affairs and may also add reminders in a period of time or inquire about the<br>
day's schedule. The calendar 12 of this month may help the user easily select<br>
a date specified, inquire about a schedule on the specified day, or set a schedule.<br>
The monthly calendar 13 of next month shows in advance next month's dates<br>
and helps the user specify a date for scheduling. Further, all months may be<br>
selected in addition to the next month. The detailed work list 14 helps the<br>
user inquire about all schedules, appointments, and important items.<br>
A conventional electronic calendar in Fig. 1 still functions through the<br>
conventional method typing in appointments and brief descriptions to shown on<br>
a screen as reminders. If the user leaves his or her computer and easily<br>
ignores some reminders, the calendar cannot be an efficient assistant.<br>
In consideration of drawbacks of the conventional electronic secretary or<br>
human assistant, a personal computer, an AV equipment, and a speech transfer<br>
device connected to a telephone line are used cooperatively with a PC-based<br>
electronic secretary software. Furthermore, the AV electronic secretary suite<br>
is thus formed without less key inputted and only selective function used for<br>
managing and inquiring the schedule during operation. Since that, all users<br>
can have their own electronic secretary thereby.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An Audio-Visual electronic secretary suite is used in a computer, and<br>
performed as an electronic calendar providing with AV records kept on one's<br>
own using a video and audio capture device as peripherals on a PC. Prompts<br>
for an appointment may be recorded at a specified time, automatic AV<br>
reminders are shown at the specified time, AV reminders may be displayed on a<br>
PC monitor, or AV reminders may be performed through a speech transfer<br>
device connected to a telephone set to a personal mobile device.<br>
The AV electronic secretary device comprises the following elements.<br>
Electronic secretary software is installed on a computer system and a PC<br>
software integrated in AV peripherals of the computer system. A video<br>
capture device and an audio capture device are both connected to the computer<br>
system. A speech transfer device is connected to the computer system with<br>
wires or wireless. A telephone is connected to the speech transfer device or<br>
to a Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). Through integration of the<br>
electronic secretary software and the video and audio capture devices an AV<br>
message is recorded so that an AV reminder is formed for schedule<br>
management.<br>
Further, through integration of the electronic secretary software and the<br>
video and audio capture devices of the computer, this invention provides an AV<br>
reminder method comprising the following steps. The electronic secretary<br>
software is executed as a daemon or standalone in the computer system. An<br>
AV message recording lime is selected, in which a recording program is<br>
launched after the time is selected in the software. The AV message is<br>
recorded through the recording program in the software. A reminder mode is<br>
set in the software. Reminder mode is determined in the software, which<br>
includes a plurality of reminder modes. The AV reminder is executed<br>
according to the reminder mode.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
For an AV electronic secretary device according to this invention and<br>
method for the same, an AV technology for a current PC is used together with<br>
proprietary AV electronic secretary software providing an electronic calendar<br>
with an automatic reminder function and keeping AV records on the AV device.<br>
Accordingly, the AV reminders is shown on a PC monitor through the PC<br>
connected to a telephone set via a speech transfer device (e.g. VoIP BOX) or<br>
being transferred to and shown on various mobile devices. Thereby, an<br>
innovative electronic secretary function with a PC-based voice self-reminder is<br>
introduced in the present invention.<br>
Fig. 2 is a schematic view illustrating an AV electronic secretary device<br>
according to this invention. The AV electronic secretary device is connected<br>
with peripherals. An electronic secretary software 210 must be installed on a<br>
computer system 21, and before or after installation, the electronic secretary<br>
software 210 may be integrated with AV peripherals connected to the computer<br>
system 21, in which a video capture device 22, an audio capture device 23, and<br>
an AV player 20 are provided in the figure. The video capture device 22 is.<br>
for example, a webcam generally used for networked video or any kind of<br>
digital video camera (DV, D8, and V8) and the like. The audio capture<br>
device 23 may be a microphone or voice capture equipment built into the video<br>
capture device 22. The AV player 20 is, for example, a monitor and speaker.<br>
The computer system 21 is connected to the Internet 24 through a first<br>
connection line 21, so the electronic secretary software 210 may achieve<br>
telecommunication in each mode through Internet 24. The first connection<br>
line 201 may be wire or wirclessly connected to the Internet, and a computer 29<br>
at the other terminal may send AV messages through the Internet 24 and even<br>
may be connected to the local computer system 21 through the electronic<br>
secretary software 210 in each PC 29 for achievement of schedule management<br>
by way of remote AV reminders. The computer system 21 is connected to a<br>
speech transfer device 25 (e.g. VoIP BOX) through a second connection line<br>
202, and the line may be wire (such as USB, IEEE 1394, parallel port, serial<br>
port, etc.) or wirclessly connected (such as Bluetooth, IrDA, WLAN, etc.). The<br>
digital AV signals compressed by and sent from the PC are delivered from a<br>
telephone set 26 through a third connection line 203 to Public Switched<br>
Telephone Network (PSTN) 27 and further to a general telephone 28 or a<br>
mobile telephone 28' or the like as a mobile telecommunication device for the<br>
purpose of an AV reminder. Moreover, the remote immobile or mobile<br>
telecommunication device may send the AV messages through PSTN 27 for<br>
achievement of schedule management by way of remote AV reminders.<br>
Fig. 3A is a schematic drawing illustrating the electronic secretary software<br>
according to this invention, in which at least each day's timetable 215 is<br>
provided, such as 0:00 am to 23:00 pm. Detailed times may be set at the time<br>
of schedule setting. A user may specify each day's specific time to arrange<br>
an AV appointment. A calendar may provide a monthly calendar 211 of this<br>
month and a monthly calendar of next month for the user to select easily a date.<br>
When the user selects a date, the timetable 215 shows the day's timetable in a<br>
timely manner. A remark area 217 is also provided for the user to input<br>
points for attention or all remarks for each appointment. The areas shown<br>
formerly may be added or reduced upon an effective demand without limit to<br>
the statement herein. When the user creates an AV prompt for an appointment<br>
or meeting at a specified date or time, a reminder symbol is formed on the date<br>
or the time to remind the user of the appointment.<br>
When an AV schedule is added, as shown in Fig. 3B for the electronic<br>
secretary software 210, a recording time setting window 31 is automatically<br>
launched at the selected time with the AV schedule to be added. Through the<br>
setting window 31, a starting time/date, a meeting time length, a topic, and an<br>
AV recording are as options for the AV schedule (such as an appointment, a<br>
meeting and the like) selected. All setting values are defaults and selection<br>
may be made using a mouse or other marking device for achievement of easy<br>
setting. Manual setting may also be available.<br>
Fig. 3C is a schematic drawing illustrating the electronic secretary software<br>
according to this invention. After the AV schedule is set, a reminder mode of<br>
the AV schedule is set through an AV reminder setting window 32, in which the<br>
reminder may be appeared before a time length through the setting and one or<br>
more times of AV reminders are repeated. For example, the AV reminder will<br>
be executed in 30 minutes, 1 hour, or 2 hours before the appointment and also<br>
can be substituted as a default setting.<br>
Fig. 3D is a schematic view illustrating a user condition setting window 33<br>
provided in the electronic secretary software 210. The user may set a<br>
plurality of conditions thereof through the window 33, and, for example, at the<br>
time of on-line mode, an AV play window bounces on the PC monitor when the<br>
AV reminder is processed, as shown in Fig. 6. If a reject mode is set. the AV<br>
reminder is turned off when the time comes. If an answering agent mode is<br>
set, the reminder will be transferred to another person (such as a secretary, a<br>
friend, or the like) and the AV reminder is executed in the person's electronic<br>
secretary software 210. Conversely, if an outgoing mode is set, the AV<br>
reminder created will be transferred to the user's mobile phone, PDA, or other<br>
portable device through a video transfer device.<br>
Fig. 3E is a schematic view illustrating the AV playback in the electronic<br>
secretary software. When the user wants to execute an AV recording at a<br>
specified time, an AV window 34 is generated after clicking an AV recording<br>
instruction, in which an AV recording contents required, such as topic,<br>
recording lime, or defaults, the recording is processed or be previewed<br>
afterward through the AV recording/play window 35 created therein.<br>
Fig. 4 is a flow chart of a preferred embodiment of a method for the AV<br>
electronic secretary according to this invention. The contents in the AV<br>
calendar are recorded through the peripherals connected to the computer<br>
system, and further the plurality of reminder modes is achieved through the<br>
reminder functions thereof. Steps thereof to be executed are as follows.<br>
In the beginning, proprietary AV secretary software of the present invention<br>
is installed in advance in the computer system. More, the video capture device<br>
and the audio capture device respectively connected to the computer system<br>
and with a telecommunication network. In step S401, after integration of an<br>
initial environment, the electronic secretary software is executed in the<br>
computer system. After the computer system is started, the electronic<br>
secretary software is executed as a daemon or standalone in the computer<br>
system is available, and after execution, the AV peripherals may be enabled<br>
immediately and be set in standby mode. In step S403, a date and time to<br>
record messages, such as year, month, and date, is selected on the calendar in<br>
the electronic secretary software, and then the recording program is launched.<br>
In step S405, AV messages are recorded through the recording program of the<br>
calendar, in which a AV file is recorded dynamically by the video capture<br>
device and an audio file is recorded by the audio capture device as well.<br>
Important events and minutes can be recorded at will. In step S406, the<br>
recorded AV contents are previewed through a preview function to determine<br>
whether the contents will be accepted, deleted, canceled, or recorded again.<br>
In step S407, after the AV contents are determined, the AV message is stored in<br>
a memory of the computer system, and an indicating reminder symbol is<br>
formed on the specified date of the electronic secretary software so that the AV<br>
message may be reviewed by clicking the symbol. In step S409. the AV<br>
message of the calendar is recorded, and a reminder mode thereof may be set.<br>
If the mode is not set, a default may be selected. The AV messages is displayed<br>
on the monitor by the specified time, such as 30 minutes or one hour earilier, in<br>
advance or transferred and displayed on the mobile phone. The reminders are<br>
kept through e-mail as a networked telecommunication mode, the reminders<br>
are transferred to a personal secretary's telephone, and the reminders are shown<br>
repeatedly through setting. According to the other embodiment of this<br>
invention, the AV messages may be transferred elsewhere: for example, the AV<br>
reminders is executed in another computer or transferred to remind other's<br>
schedule.<br>
In step S411, after the setting is finished, the system enters the standby mode of<br>
events of the calendar and then the user may select the outgoing mode, the<br>
reject mode, the answering agent mode, or the on-line mode by himself, then<br>
the electronic secretary software determines which reminder mode was selected<br>
simultaneously. For example, if the user determines to stay in the outgoing<br>
mode, which indicates that the user may not use the computer or leave that<br>
place, then the reminders are transferred by a telephone system using the<br>
speech transfer device connected to the computer system to a mobile device.<br>
In step S413, when the time set for the reminders comes, the AV reminders are<br>
executed and played on the PC monitor or the mobile device, or the AV<br>
reminders are given through e-mail or other Internet telecommunication ways.<br>
Later, when receiving the AV reminders, the user may give a signal for<br>
confirmation to prevent repeated reminders or may delete the reminders or<br>
reply to the reminders.<br>
After the process of the reminder is finished, the steps are ended and ready<br>
for the next AV reminder.<br>
From steps S403 to S411 for AV recording, in the embodiments of this<br>
invention, through a PC-based AV setting time input, the user may quickly set<br>
an input for AV recording using his own PC and even may execute a remote<br>
AV electronic secretary setting using a PC at another terminal connected with<br>
Internet through video software. A process thereof is illustrated in Fig. 5.<br>
In the beginning, an initial environment mentioned above is integrated. In<br>
step S501, a message recording lime is selected from a remote computer<br>
system or various portable devices, such as a mobile phone, a PDA, a notebook<br>
and the like, and then the AV message recording is executed. In step S5O3,<br>
AV messages are transferred through wired or wireless Internet to the electronic<br>
secretary software installed in a local computer system, and then a schedule<br>
reminder symbol is formed at a specified time. In step S505, a reminder time<br>
and a reminder mode are set to complete the steps of remote setting. In step<br>
S507, in standby mode, AV reminders arc executed when the specified time<br>
comes.<br>
According to the embodiment of this invention, the AV messages recorded<br>
from the remote mobile phone arc transferred to the local computer system,<br>
thereby the schedule setting is completed. In another embodiment, speech<br>
sounds are transferred by a mobile phone or a common telephone through the<br>
speech transfer device to the local computer system for completion of the<br>
speech recording. The schedule setting of the remote AV electronic secretary<br>
is thus achieved.<br>
The AV electronic secretary according to this invention and method for the<br>
same is not only used for a single user's schedule setting but also used to<br>
transfer the recorded AV messages to a second user for schedule setting. A<br>
flow chart in Fig. 6 illustrates steps of arranging a schedule through the AV<br>
electronic secretary according to this invention.<br>
In the beginning, an initial environment is integrated. In step S601, a first<br>
user records AV messages through the remote computer system, various<br>
portable devices, or the local device. In step S603, the AV messages are<br>
transferred through wired or wireless connection with Internet to remind a<br>
second user about the schedules. In step S605, when receiving the AV<br>
messages, a second user stores the messages in the electronic secretary<br>
software according to a specified time setting thereinto. In step S607,<br>
according to the setting or a schedule set by the second user through the<br>
electronic secretary software, a schedule reminder symbol is formed at the<br>
specified time. In step S609, after a reminder time and a reminder mode<br>
thereof are set, the second user's computer system enters standby mode,<br>
engagement mode of schedules of the first user and the second user. According<br>
to this invention, the proprietary AV software is linked with the computer, the<br>
telephone, and the speech transfer device. A brand-new remote voice calling<br>
system for management is thus formed after integration of the software and the<br>
hardware. The system breaks a rule that pure software in a PC is used for<br>
query only and breaks through a time limit; namely, this invention pushes the<br>
PC-based voice calling to work for 24 hours. This system further works with<br>
the originally developed AV input, off-hook, and query functions better than a<br>
traditional query by way of input of characters, so that close humanization and<br>
time-saving query, calling, and answering are achieved, and all contents and<br>
detailed special notes of the schedule may be completely expressed without<br>
being ignored.<br>
Further, this invention provides only an input of all schedules to the<br>
computer, so no one will be required hereafter to remember what he or she<br>
input or be required to search for reminders. The computer will remind the<br>
user in advance and call the user for the reminders when the time comes.<br>
Thus, regardless of a secretary, all of the schedules are fully handled well by<br>
this system.<br>
To sum up. the AV electronic secretary device according to this invention<br>
and method for the same incorporates as an electronic calendar providing AV<br>
records kept on one's own using a video and audio capture device coupled with<br>
a PC for achieving the AV schedule management.<br>
However, in the description mentioned above, only the preferred<br>
embodiments according to this invention are provided without limit to claims<br>
of this invention; all those skilled in the art without exception should include<br>
the equivalent changes and modifications as falling within the true scope and<br>
