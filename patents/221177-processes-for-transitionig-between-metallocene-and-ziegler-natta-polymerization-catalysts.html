				<td>PROCESSES FOR TRANSITIONING BETWEEN METALLOCENE AND ZIEGLER-<br>
NATTA POLYMERIZATION CATALYSTS<br>
Field of Invention<br>
[001]  This invention relates to processes for transitioning among polymerization catalyst<br>
systems, preferably catalyst systems that are incompatible with each other. Particularly, the invention relates to processes for transitioning among olefin polymerization reactions utilizing metallocene catalyst systems and Ziegler-Natta catalyst systems.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
[002]        During the production of olefin polymers in a commercial reactor it is often<br>
necessary to transition from one type of catalyst system producing polymers having certain properties and characteristics to another catalyst system capable of producing polymers of different chemical and/or physical attributes. Transitioning between similar Ziegler-Natta catalyst systems, or compatible catalyst systems, for instance, generally takes place easily. However, where the catalyst systems are incompatible or of different types the process is typically complicated. For example, when transitioning between two incompatible catalyst systems such as a Ziegler-Natta catalyst system and a metallocene catalyst system, it has been found that some of the components of the Ziegler-Natta catalyst system act as poisons to the metallocene catalyst system. Consequently, the components of the Ziegler-Natta catalyst system prevent the metallocene catalyst system from promoting polymerization. [003] In the past, to accomplish an effective transition between incompatible catalysts, the first catalyzed olefin polymerization process was stopped by various techniques known in the art. The reactor was then emptied, recharged and a second catalyst system was introduced into the reactor. Such catalyst conversions are time consuming and costly because of the need for a reactor shut-down for an extended period of time during transition.<br><br>
[004] It would be highly advantageous to have a process for transitioning between incompatible catalysts, without the need for halting the polymerization reaction, emptying the reactor to rid it of the original catalyst system and restarting the polymerization reaction with another catalyst system. In addition, it would be advantageous if the process for transitioning could reduce the amount of off-grade material produced during the transition process, reduce the transition time, increase the robustness and stability of the transition process and avoid the need to open the reactor to charge the seed bed.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
[005]        The   present   invention  relates  to   a  process   for  transitioning  from   a   first<br>
polymerization reaction conducted in the presence of a first catalyst to a second polymerization reaction conducted in the presence of a second catalyst wherein the first and second catalysts are incompatible. The process comprises discontinuing the introduction of the first catalyst into a reactor wherein the first catalyst comprises a metallocene catalyst; introducing and dispersing in the reactor at least one deactivating agent selected from the group consisting of oxygen, air, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, water, oleic acid, and ammonia in an amount sufficient to substantially halt the first polymerization reaction; purging the reactor with an inert gas to substantially remove unconsumed deactivating agent from the reactor; and introducing the second catalyst into the reactor wherein the second catalyst comprises a traditional Ziegler-Natta catalyst.<br>
[006] According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the polymerization process is conducted by the essentially continuous passage of monomer gases through the polymerization zone of a gas phase fluidized bed reactor which contains a fluidized bed of polymer particles.<br><br>
[007] According to another preferred embodiment, a transition agent is introduced in the reactor to aid in reducing static electricity buildup, temperature gradients, bed height fluctuations, and other instabilities ordinarily encountered when transitioning from one catalyst system to another, especially where the second catalyst system is incompatible with the first catalyst system. Still more preferably, the transition agent is selected from the group consisting of alkoxylated amines and alkoxylated amides. And more preferably still, the transition agent is ethoxylated stearyl amine, which may be optionally supported on a solid material. [008] In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the deactivating agent comprises oxygen in an amount approximately equal to or greater than 1 molar equivalent based on the gram-atoms of active metal in the first catalyst.<br>
[009] In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the step of introducing and dispersing a deactivating agent and the step of purging the reactor with an inert gas are repeated one or more times. The deactivating agents employed have varying degrees of ability to permanently halt the polymerization reaction and are sometimes described as "reversible" or "irreversible," as those terms are used in US Patent No. 5,442,019, which refers to reversible and irreversible catalyst killers, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety. It is within the scope of the present invention to introduce reversible deactivating agents into the reactor, followed by irreversible deactivating agents.<br>
[0010] In yet another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the process further comprises introducing into the reactor, prior to the introduction of the second catalyst, a passivating agent in an amount to effectively passivate the reactor such as by scavenging any residual compounds capable of causing further polymerization and/or inhibiting the activity of the second catalyst system. In a still more preferred embodiment, the passivating agent comprises an organometallic compound represented by the formula 8X3 or AlR(3-a)Xa, where R<br><br>
is a branched or straight chain alkyl, cycloalkyl, heterocycloalkyl, aryl, or a hydride radical having from 1 to 30 carbon atoms, X is a halogen, and a is 0, 1, or 2. In a still more preferred embodiment, the passivating agent comprises triethylaluminum.<br>
[0011] According to another preferred embodiment of the present invention, when water is present in the reactor, the process further comprises purging the reactor until the concentration of water vapor in the reactor is less than or equal to 100 parts per million by weight, based on the weight of the seedbed, before introducing and dispersing the second catalyst into the reactor, and still more preferably, the purging of water vapor is continued until the concentration of water vapor is less than or equal to 20 parts per million by reactor volume. [0012] In another embodiment of the present invention, a traditional Ziegler-Natta catalyst system without the introduction of an activator or co-catalyst therefor is used to halt the first polymerization reaction, whereupon, after termination of the first polymerization reaction, an activator or co-catalyst of the Ziegler-Natta catalyst system is introduced in an amount sufficient to effectively activate the Ziegler-Natta catalyst.<br>
[0013] In a more preferred embodiment of the present invention, the activator or co-catalyst for the second catalyst comprises an organometallic compound represented by the formula 8X3 or AlR(3_a)Xa, where R is a branched or straight chain alkyl, cycloalkyl, heterocycloalkyl, aryl or a hydride radical having from 1 to 30 carbon atoms, x is a halogen, and a is 0, 1, or 2, and still more preferably, the activator or co-catalyst for the second catalyst comprises triethylaluminum.<br>
[0014] The invention particularly relates to the discovery that certain materials are effective as a deactivating agent for a metallocene catalyzed polymerization reaction whereas the materials are ineffective for deactivating traditional Ziegler-Natta catalyst systems or exhibit<br><br>
different deactivating characteristics in regard to traditional Ziegler-Natta catalyst systems than for metallocene catalyst systems.<br>
Detailed Description<br>
[0015]      The present invention relates to processes for transitioning between catalysts and/or<br>
catalyst systems to convert a reactor from producing one type of product to another with minimal reactor down-time.<br>
[0016] In particular, preferred processes are drawn to transitioning between Ziegler-Natta catalysts/catalyst systems and metallocene catalysts/catalyst systems. For the purpose of this patent specification and appended claims the terms "catalyst" and "catalyst system" shall be used interchangeably and shall have the identical meaning.<br>
[0017] The processes of the present invention preferably are used in gas phase, solution phase, slurry or bulk phase polymerization processes. Most preferably, the processes of the present invention are used in a gas phase polymerization process in a fluidized bed reactor. [0018] In a typical continuous gas fluidized bed polymerization process for the production of polymer from monomer, a gaseous stream comprising monomer is passed through a fluidized bed reactor in the presence of a catalyst under reactive conditions. A polymer product is withdrawn from the fluidized bed reactor. Also withdrawn from the reactor is a cycle gas stream, which is continuously circulated and usually cooled. The cycle gas stream is returned to the reactor together with additional monomer sufficient to replace the monomer consumed in the polymerization reaction. For detailed descriptions of gas phase fluidized bed polymerization processes, see U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,543,399, 4,588,790, 5,028,670, 5,352,769 and 5,405,922, the disclosures of which are hereby fully incorporated herein by reference.<br><br>
[0019] For a given catalyst to produce a given product of a certain density and melt index, which generally depends on how well a catalyst incorporates comonomer, a certain gas composition must be present in the reactor.<br>
[0020] Generally the gas contains at least one alpha-olefin having from 2 to 20 carbon atoms, preferably 2-15 carbon atoms, for example, ethylene, propylene, butene-1, pentene-1, 4-methylpentene-1, hexene-1, octene-1, decene-1 and cyclic olefins such as styrene. Other monomers can include polar vinyl, diene, norbornene, acetylene and aldehyde monomers. In the preferred embodiments of the present invention, the gas composition contains ethylene and at least one alpha-olefin having 3 to 15 carbon atoms, most preferably is butene-1, hexene-1 or octene-1.<br>
[0021] Typically, the gas composition also contains an amount of hydrogen to control the melt index of the polymer to be produced. In typical circumstances the gas also contains an amount of a dew point increasing component with the balance of the gas composition made up of non-condensable inerts, for example, nitrogen.<br>
[0022] Depending on the second catalyst to be introduced into the reactor the gas concentrations of the various components of the gas composition can be altered, for instance, the comonomer and hydrogen gas concentrations can be increased or decreased. [0023] When transitioning between compatible catalysts there are typically only slight differences in the performance of the catalysts in regard to hydrogen response and comonomer incorporation. Conversely, when transitioning between incompatible catalysts, the interactions are not straightforward. For example, Ziegler-Natta and metallocene catalysts have extremely different responses to molecular weight regulators, such as hydrogen and comonomer, which makes these catalysts incompatible. Any traces of active Ziegler-Natta catalyst will produce very high molecular weight product under metallocene catalyst reactor conditions.<br><br>
Furthermore, particularly in a continuous transition process, the interaction between two incompatible catalysts may lead to the production of high levels of small particles less than about 100 microns that are referred to as "fines". Fines can induce operability problems in the reactor and/or fouling and sheeting incidents.<br>
[0024] During the transition from a first catalyst to a second catalyst, particularly in a continuous process, adverse interactions or contact of the two catalysts typically occur. For - compatible catalysts, the transition normally occurs by discontinuing the feed of the first catalyst while commencing the feed of the second catalyst. Typically it takes many hours until the first catalyst is entirely consumed. So, for a relatively long period of time the resin produced is a mixture from both the first and the second catalyst.<br>
[0025]      Compatible catalysts are those catalysts having similar kinetics of termination and insertion of monomer and comonomer(s) and/or do not detrimentally interact with each other. [0026]      For the purpose of this patent specification and appended claims the term "incompatible catalysts" shall refer to and mean catalysts that satisfy one or more of the following:<br>
1)	those catalysts that when present together reduce the activity of at least one of the<br>
catalysts by greater than 50%;<br>
2)	those catalysts that under the same reactive conditions produce polymers such that<br>
one of the polymers has a molecular weight that is more than twice the molecular weight of the<br>
other polymer; and<br>
3)	those catalysts that differ in comonomer incorporation or reactivity ratio under the<br>
same conditions by more than about 30%.<br>
[0027] As noted above, preferred processes of the present invention are applicable to, transitioning between a metallocene catalyst system and a Ziegler-Natta catalyst system.<br><br>
According to this process, in a steady state operation with a metallocene catalyst, the first polymerization reaction is halted by first discontinuing the introduction to the reactor of the metallocene catalyst, followed by introducing and dispersing in the reactor at least one deactivating agent selected from the group consisting of oxygen, air, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, water, oleic acid, and ammonia in an amount sufficient to substantially halt the first polymerization reaction, then purging the reactor with an inert gas to substantially remove unconsumed deactivating agent from the reactor, and finally introducing the second catalyst into the reactor wherein the second catalyst comprises a traditional Ziegler-Natta catalyst. [0028] According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the polymerization process is conducted by the essentially continuous passage of monomer gases through the polymerization zone of a gas phase fluidized bed reactor which contains a fluidized bed of polymer particles.<br>
[0029] According to another preferred embodiment, a transition agent is introduced in the reactor to aid in reducing static electricity buildup, temperature gradients, bed height fluctuations, and other instabilities that are typically encountered when transitioning from one catalyst system to another, especially where the second catalyst system is incompatible with the first catalyst system. Still more preferably, the transition agent is selected from the group consisting of alkoxylated amines and alkoxylated amides, and more preferably still, the transition agent is ethoxylated stearyl amine, which may be optionally supported on a solid material such as silica.<br>
[0030] In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the deactivating agent comprises oxygen in an amount approximately equal to or greater than 1 molar equivalent based on the gram-atoms of active metal in the first catalyst.<br><br>
[0031] In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the step of introducing and dispersing a deactivating agent and the step of purging the reactor with an inert gas are repeated one or more times. The deactivating agents employed have varying degrees of ability to permanently halt the polymerization reaction and are sometimes described as "reversible" or "irreversible," as those terms are used in US Patent No. 5,442,019, which refers to reversible and irreversible catalyst killers, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety. It is within the scope of the present invention to introduce reversible deactivating agents into the reactor, followed by irreversible deactivating agents.<br>
[0032] In yet another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the process further comprises introducing into the reactor, prior to the introduction of the second catalyst, a passivating agent in an amount to effectively passivate the reactor by scavenging any residual compounds capable of causing further polymerization. Still more preferably, the passivating agent comprises an organometallic compound represented by the formula 8X3 or AlR^Xa, where R is a branched or straight chain alkyl, cycloalkyl, heterocycloalkyl, aryl, or a hydride radical having from 1 to 30 carbon atoms, X is a halogen, and a is 0, 1, or 2. In a still more preferred embodiment, the passivating agent comprises triethylaluminum. [0033] According to another preferred embodiment of the present invention, when water is present in the reactor, the process further comprises, purging the reactor until the concentration of water vapor in the reactor is less than or equal to 100 parts per million by weight, based on the weight of the seedbed, before introducing and dispersing the second catalyst into the reactor, and still more preferably, the purging of water vapor is continued until the concentration of water vapor is less than or equal to 20 parts per million by reactor volume. [0034] In another embodiment of the present invention, a traditional Ziegler-Natta catalyst system without the introduction of an activator or co-catalyst therefor is used to terminate the<br><br>
first polymerization reaction, whereupon, after termination of the first polymerization reaction, an activator or co-catalyst of the Ziegler-Natta catalyst system is introduced in an amount sufficient to effectively activate the Ziegler-Natta catalyst. In a more preferred embodiment of the present invention, the activator or co-catalyst for the second catalyst comprises an organometallic compound represented by the formula 8X3 or AlR(3-a)Xa, where R is a branched or straight chain alkyl, cycloalkyl, heterocycloalkyl, aryl or a hydride radical having from 1 to 30 carbon atoms, x is a halogen, and a is 0, 1, or 2, and still more preferably, the activator or co-catalyst for the second catalyst comprises triethylaluminum.<br>

[0069] In order to provide a better understanding of the present invention, the following examples are offered as related to actual tests performed in the practice of the invention.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1<br>
[0070]      A 2.1 liter stirred autoclave reactor, running at steady state conditions with a<br>
metallocene catalyst system (i.e., bis(l,3-methyl butyl cyclopentadienyl) zirconium dichloride with methylalumoxane as the co-catalyst) and producing a polymerization product having a 24 dg/min melt index and 0.924 g/cc density was used to conduct a transition from a metallocene catalyst system to a Ziegler-Natta catalyst system. The conditions for the metallocene catalyzed polymerization were as follows:<br>
Metallocene Catalyst	Zr (wt %) 0.35<br>
Temperature (°C)	86<br>
Pressure (psi)	314.6<br>
Ethylene (mole %)	32.8<br>
Hydrogen (mole %)	0.050 (502 ppm)<br>
Butene (mole %)	2.1<br><br>
Bed Weight (Kg)	135<br>
Production Rate (Kg/Hr)	37<br>
Catalyst Productivity (Kg/Kg)	3500<br>
Bulk Density (g/cc)	0.35<br>
Average Particle Size (microns)	590<br>
Fines (% less than 120 microns)	3.28<br>
With regard to the above steady-state polymerization with a metallocene catalyst system, the following is a non-limiting description of a transition procedure from the metallocene catalyst system to a Ziegler-Natta catalyst system that is within the scope of the present invention: [0071]      1.   The metallocene catalyst feed to the reactor was stopped. [0072]      2.   C()2 was injected into the reactor at about 400-500 ppm by volume, as a metallocene catalyst deactivating agent.<br>
[0073] 3. Once the reaction began to fall off, all feeds to the reactor were blocked-in, including the monomer and recycle stream.<br>
[0074] 4. It was confirmed that the polymerization reaction had been terminated, for example, by measuring the temperature change within the reactor.<br>
[0075]      5.  The product discharge was turned off.<br>
[0076] 6. Hydrocarbons were removed from the reactor (while maintaining the reactor at 86°C) by purging with dry nitrogen at a velocity of 2.25 ft/sec, until the lower explosive limit (LEL) was zero.<br>
[0077] 7. During the nitrogen purging, the metallocene catalyst supply vessels were removed and it was confirmed that no residual metallocene catalyst was left in the feeder lines.<br><br>
[0078] 8. Once the LEL was zero, the reactor was vented and depressurized to 50 psig by stopping the nitrogen purge and blocking in nitrogen to the reactor to maintain 50 psig reactor pressure.<br>
[0079] 9. The reactor was air scavenged with the reactor at 50 psig, by slowly increasing reactor pressure to 100 psig in 5-psig increments using only plant air and holding for five minutes after each incremental increase while monitoring all reactor temperatures. If a significant temperature increase occurred during air scavenging, water would have been injected into the reactor and the transition would have been aborted.<br>
[0080] 10. The reactor was air scavenged a total of four times by repeating depressurizing the reactor back to 50 psig and incrementally increasing reactor pressure to 100 psig.<br>
[0081] 11. Once the air scavenging was complete (wherein the oxygen rate is 5000 ppm based on seedbed weight), the reactor was purged with dry nitrogen 10 times (wherein depressurization to 55 psig, then pressurization to 115 psig and depressurization back to 55 psig was taken as one pressure purge) to vent all air and provide an air-free reactor.<br>
[0082] 12. The reactor was passivated with triethylaluminum (as described in US Patent No. 5,106,926, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference) using a 10 weight percent solution of triethylaluminum in isopentane at a rate of about 3 ppm based on seedbed weight and the reactor was prepared for a Ziegler-Natta catalyst startup.<br><br>
Example 2<br>
[0083]      Using the same metallocene catalyst system, reactor and substantially the same<br>
steady state conditions as described above for Example 1, the following transition was conducted:<br>
[0084] 1. While operating at a bed temperature of about 86°C, a cycle gas velocity of about 2.25 ft/sec, a total gas pressure of about 300 psig and a bed weight of about 550 Ibs, the metallocene catalyst feed was stopped and the compressor allowed to remain running during the transition.<br>
[0085] 2. All monomer feeds were blocked in, the product discharge turned off, and the reactor contents allowed to recirculate (recycle).<br>
[0086] 3. About 50 cc's of F^O were injected into the reactor at reactor pressure and the reactor was slowly vented to reach about 60 psig over a 2 hour 40 minute time span. Reactor temperatures changes were monitored to ensure the polymerization reaction had been halted by the end of the time span.<br>
[0087] 4. The reactor was purged with dry nitrogen until the LEL was less than 0.1% by volume.<br>
[0088] 5. During the nitrogen purging, the metallocene catalyst supply vessels were removed, it was ensured that no residual catalyst was left in the feeder lines, and the triethylaluminum pumps were prepared for triethylaluminum injection.<br><br>
[0089] 6. Once the LEL was less than 0.1% by reactor volume, nitrogen purging was stopped, the nitrogen was blocked in, the reactor was vented/depressurized to 50 psig, and the atmospheric vent was closed.<br>
[0090] 7. The reactor was air scavenged with the reactor at 50 psig, by slowly increasing reactor pressure to 100 psig by 5-psig increments using only plant air and holding for five minutes after each incremental increase while monitoring all reactor temperatures. If a significant temperature increase had occurred during air scavenging, water would have been injected into the reactor and the transition would have been aborted, i.e. air feed would have been stopped and the restart procedure at step 3 above would have been restarted.<br>
[0091] 8. The reactor was air scavenged a total of four times by repeating venting to depressurize the reactor back to 50 psig and incrementally increasing reactor pressure (with vent closed) to 100 psig with air three additional times.<br>
[0092] 9. After no exotherm was observed, the reactor was pressure purged 10 times to atmosphere using a 50 psig - 80 psig - 50 psig sequence with plant air to nitrogen free the reactor. When air purges were complete, the air was blocked in and air was allowed to circulate for 2 hours.<br>
[0093] 10. When air circulation was complete, 10 pressure purges were performed using a 50 psig -120 psig -50 psig sequence with dry nitrogen to a remove air and any moisture from the reactor system. Nitrogen pressure purging was repeated until the air/oxygen level was nil and the moisture level was less than 20 ppm based on bed weight for at least two consecutive hours of runtime.<br><br>
[0094] 11. The reactor was passivated with triethylaluminum (as described in US Patent No. 5,106,926, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference) using a 10 weight percent solution of triethylaluminum in isopentane at a rate of about 3 ppm based on bed weight. The reactor was prepared for a Ziegler-Natta catalyst startup wherein conditions of reactor pressure and reactant concentrations (including hydrogen, if any) were built to near target levels before the Ziegler-Natta catalyst feed to the reactor was started, and the bed weight was allowed to gradually increase after the introduction of the Ziegler-Natta catalyst. The reaction was observed to increase as indicated by reactor temperature changes. [0095] While the present invention has been described and illustrated by reference to particular embodiments, it will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that the invention lends itself to variations not necessarily illustrated herein. For example, it is not beyond the scope of this invention to transition between one or more mixed catalysts to one or more incompatible mixed catalysts and vice-versa. For this reason, then, reference should be made solely to the appended claims for purposes of determining the true scope of the present invention.<br><br>
