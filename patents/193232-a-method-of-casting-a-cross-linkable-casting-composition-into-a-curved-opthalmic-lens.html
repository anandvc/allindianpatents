FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invervtion is directed to polyester resin-based compositions and methods of manufacturing and using cured, polymeric articles, and coatings therefrom.  The compositions and methods are especially useful in the manufacture of ophthalmic lenses. More particularly, the present invention is directed to unsaturated polyester-based polymeric articles, particularly unsaturated polyester-based ophthalmic lenses, that have improved optical uniformity (or lower optical distortion) and increased tint speed, while maintaining "water-white" color over time.  The lenses are characterized by a relatively high index of refraction (at least about 1.5 and preferably at least about 1.56) and relatively low density, particularly below about 1.3 grams/cc, e.g., 1.24 grams/cc.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION AND PRIOR ART<br>
	  Plastic materials have been used for the<br>
manufacture of ophthalmic lenses for many years. Plastics offer advantages to the patient over glass, most noticeably in their lower densities, allowing for a lighter lens, and greater impact strength. Conversely, plastic lenses can exhibit disadvantages: they tend to scratch more easily, have higher levels of chromatic aberration (lower ABBE values), and may distort at higher temperature<br><br>
processing conditions, due to lower glass transition (Tg) temperatures, resulting in "warped" lenses, or lenses with high levels of optical distortion. Additionally, plastic lenses usually have lower index of refraction values when compared to glass, which tends to require lenses of increased thickness and reduced cosmetic appeal.  The standard "CR-39" type lens, made from diethylene glycol bis(allyl carbonate), has an index of refraction of 1.498.<br>
Advances in technology have allowed improvements in plastic lens performance.  Coatings have been developed which impart improved scratch resistance.  Some plastics have relatively high ABBE values which are adequate for minimizing the effects of chromatic aberration.  Improvements in machining and optical lens processing equipment and processes have permitted the use of inat*=rials having lower glass transition temperatures.  Plastics with higher indices of refraction, and physical lens design improvements, have helped improve the cosmetic appeal of plastic lenses.<br>
While these improvements have helped the plastic lens gain acceptance in the marketplace, to a point where plastic lenses constitute a majority .of lens eyewear in the U.S., increasing expectations for performance have dictated that good ophthalmic lenses have the following characteristics:<br>
Clarity and Color<br>
Lenses which are "hazy" are obviously unacceptable to the patient.  Color is also of concern both from the standpoint of having a "water-<br><br>
lens is first purchased, as well as maintenance of that color over time, e.g., being resistant to the effects of sun light, which over time can cause the lens to turn yellow.<br>
Optical Distortion<br>
Lack of optical distortion requires a material having a relatively high ABBE number such that chromatic aberration is minimized; and, more importantly, a material having excellent uniformity in composition such that the occurrence of visible "waves" is minimized.<br>
Rapidly Tintability<br>
Many ophthalmic lenses are manufactured in<br><br>
laboratories where the prescription is "ground in". With ever increasing emphasis on short optical lab turn-around times, e.g., 1 hour service, the ability of the lens material to rapidly accept fashion tints is important.  In the case of semi-finished lens products, the front surface of the lens may have a scratch resistant coating which does not accept tint.  Thus, the only route for tinting to occur may be the parent lens material on the back surface. This material must be tintable.<br>
High Index of Refraction and Low Density<br>
The higher the index of refraction, the thinner the finished lens will be for a given design. This- higher index, especially when combined<br><br>
with a relatively low density, will allow ror the manufacture of "thinner and lighter" lens products.<br>
Other the past several years, plastic ophthalmic lenses have been fabricated from a variety of materials including polycarbonate and polymethylmethacrylate, as well as polymerized allylic compounds, epoxies, and urethanes.  The most common plastic ophthalmic lens, however, is made from diethylene glycol bis(allyl carbonate) often referred to as "CR-39" (a specific product manufactured by PPG Industries).  As previously mentioned, this material has a refractive index of 1.498.  It is easily processed in optical laboratories, is able to be manufactured with low optical distortion and is readily tinted by various commercially available tinting dyes.<br>
The use of polyester materials to produce ophthalmic lenses has been previously disclosed in various U.S. patents.  Examples of such disclosures are U.S. Patent Nos. 3,391,224 and 3,513,224. Patent No. 3,391,224 discloses a composition in which a polyester is combined with from 5 to 20 weight percent methyl methacrylate and less than 5 weight percent styrene to produce a thermosetting product which can be used to produce an ophthalmic lens.  Patent No. 3,513,224 discloses a composition in which 70 to 75 weight percent of a specific unsaturated polyester formed from the reaction of fumaric acid with triethylene glycol and 2,2-dimethyl-l,3-propanediol (otherwise known as neopentyl glycol) is combined with about 12 to 18 weight percent styrene and 8 to 12 weight percent ethylene glycol dimethacrylate.  The styrene raises<br><br>
the index of refraction to approximately 1.52, and the ethylene glycol dimethacrylate reduces brittleness of the polymer.<br>
A niimber of commercially available unsaturated polyester resins has been developed which are clear when cast and have a refractive index of approximately 1.56 (the high index being primarily attributable to the use of styrene as a cross-linking diluent monomer at a level of approximately 30 to 45 weight percent).  The densities of the various polyester systems are also quite low (on the order of 1.25 grams/cc).  These properties are superior to CR-39 (index of 1.498 and density of 1.32 grams/cc) with regard to the potential to make "thinner and lighter" lenses.<br>
Polymerization of the polyester resin toystem can be carried out in a number of ways. Quite common is the use of a system promoted with a material such as cobalt octoate or cobalt naphthenate.  When used with methyl ethyl ketone peroxide, the system can be cured near room temperature.  Other free radical polymerization techniques also can be used, including thermal curing using peroxides or diazo compounds, as well as photoinitiated curing using compounds selected from the following classes of photoinitiators: benzoin ethers,, benzophenones, thicxanthones, ketals, acetophenones, and phosphine oxides.<br>
Polyester resins can be manufactured using different compositions to achieve a wide variety of physical pjroperties (hard, soft, rigid, flexible, and the like). Typical commercial polyesters<br><br>
include those made from a variety of glycols and acids.  Common glycols used in alkyd polyester synthesis include: ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, propylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, neopentyl glycol, and the like.  Common acids used include: phthalic anhydride, isophthalic acid, adipic acid, and the like, used in conjunction with maleic anhydride and/or fumaric acid to provide unsaturation for cross-linking, usually with styrene or other diluent monomers.<br>
Resins made using phthalic anhydride are commonly called "ortho resins"; those made with isophthalic acid are commonly referred to as "iso resins".  With respect to properties desirable for making ophthalmic lenses, typical iso resins which have good scratch resistance are generally quite slow to tint.  Typical ortho resins, on the other nand, are generally more scratch-prone, but tint more readily.  All of the unsaturated polyesrer resins have a propensity to polymerize somewhat non-uniformly causing internal optical distortion or visible "waves".<br>
As previously mentioned, styrene is commonly used as a cross-linking diluent monomer with unsaturated polyester compositions.  As the portion of styrene is increased, the index of refraction also increases.  However, the presence of higher concentrations of styrene also tends to cause a higher degree of exotherm within the polymerizing composition leading to the formation of optical distortion within the lens.  Improving optical uniformity (lowering-optical distortion) and increasing tint speed in an unsaturated polyester<br><br>
resin-based ophthalmic lens composition, while maintaining a high index of refraction and color, therefore, is a formidable task.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In brief, the present invention is directed to unsaturated polyester resin-based compositions that are modified for unexpected improvement in uniform, low optical distortion and/or improved tint speed by the addition of one or more additives selected from a monomeric allylic ester and/or an acrylate monomer or oligomer (weight average molecular weight below about 1,000), together with an exotherm depressant, making the modified polyester resin-based composition commercially viable for casting ophthalmic lenses. The additive(s) and exotherm deptessant are useful to modify the polyester for sufficient improvement in reducing optical distortion and/or improving tint speed such that any unsaturated polyester resin capable of producing a relatively clear or colorless casting will be improved sufficiently to provide a composition having the required properties for an ophthalmic lens.  Sometimes the additive will need to include a color enhancing dye to arrive at optimum lens color.<br>
Accordingly, one aspect of the present invention is to provide unsaturated polyester resin-based compositions, including an exotherm depressant, such as alpha-methyl styrene, and an additive selected from an allylic ester, an acrylate monomer, and mixtures thereof, having improved-optical uniformity and/or increased tinting speed.<br><br>
Another aspect of the present invention is to provide a method of manufacturing ophthalmic lenses by polymerizing and curing a polyester resin-based composition within a mold cavity, said composition containing an exotherm depressant and an additive selected from an allylic ester, an acrylate monomer, and mixtures thereof, whereby the curing cycle temperatures are increased in essentially uniform steps, between about SOT and about 200"?, preferably between about 9ST and about 190*»F over a period of time of at least about 7 hours to about 20 hours, more preferably about 12 hours to about 18 hours.  After completion of this curing cycle, the lenses exhibit excellent optical uniformity.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention is to provide a method of manufacturing ophthalmic lenses by polymerizing and curing a polyester resin-based composition within a curved mold cavity, wherein the composition includes an exotherm depressant to slow the rate of polymerization, and at least two thermal polymerization initiators.  One initiator, e.g., di-(4-tertr-butylcyclohexyl) peroxydicarbonate, is effective to initiate polymerization over a lower, polymerization temperature range, e.g., from about 95"F to about 150=F; a second thermal initiator, e.g., tcrt-butyl peroxy-2-ethyl hexanoate, is effective to initiate polymerization over an upper portion of the polymerization and curing temperature range, e.g., from about 150"F to about 190*F.<br>
The above and other aspects and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent<br><br>
from the following detailed description of tne preferred embodiments of the present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The compositions of the present invention include an unsaturated polyester resin as a predominant portion of the composition (more than 50% by weight, preferably more than about 70% by weight, e.g., about 70% to about 85% by weight of the composition).  Unsaturated polyesters are well known and can be manufactured by the reaction of one or more polyols with one or more polycarboxylic acids, with olefinic unsaturation being provided by one or more of the reactants, usually the acid.  The resultant unsaturation in the polyester enables these resins to form thermosetting, cross-linked reaction products with compounds that contain olefinic double bonds, such as styrene and/or methyl methacrylate.  Commercially available unsaturated polyesters which can be used in accordance with the present invention include the reaction products of one or more saturated or unsaturated dicarboxylic acids, or their ester-forming derivatives, with a saturated or a vinyl-group-containing polyhydric alcohol.<br>
Examples of suitable unsaturated dicarboxylic acids include maleic acid, fuinarlc acid, citraconic acid, itaconic acid, meconic acid, and anhydrides thereof, lower alkyl esters or acid halides thereof.<br>
Examples of suitable saturated dicarboxylic acids include aliphatic dicarboxylic acids, such as<br><br>
malonic acid, succinic acid, glutaric acid, adipic acid, suberic acid, azelaic acid, pimelic acid, or sebacic acid; and aromatic dicarboxylic acids, such as orthophthalic acid, terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid, ni,p-diphenyl dicarboxylic acid, and diphenic acid; and anhydrides of these acids, such as phthalic anhydride and maleic anhydride, lower alkyl esters or acid halides of these acids, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Examples of suitable polyols include ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, butylene glycol, neopentyl glycol, diethylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, triethylene glycol, poly(ethylene glycol)s and mixtures thereof.<br>
The base polyester resin used in the compositions and rno.t-hods of the present invention should have a number average molecular weight in the range of about 1,000 to about 5,000, preferably about 1,500 to about 4,000, and should be without haze.  Suitable unsaturated polyesters having such properties are well known in the art.<br>
As examples of suitable unsaturated polyester resins, the base polyester can be a polyester formed by the reaction of propylene glycol, phthalic anhydride and maleic anhydride, such as the "S-40" unsaturated polyester disclosed in Bright U.S. Patent No. 5,319,007.  The composition disclosed in the Bright patent includes a phenoxyethyl aerylate, which is not included as an acrylate additive in accordance with the present indention.  Another suitable unsaturated polyester-is formed by the reaction of maleic anhydride.<br><br>
orthophthalic anhydride and propylene glycol, sucn as "Aropol L-2506-15" of Ashland Chemical Co., also disclosed in the above-identified Bright U.S. Patent No. 5,319,007.<br>
The preferred polyester resins useful in accordance with the present invention are shown in the following examples and are the reaction products of one or more acids or anhydrides selected from phthalic acid, isophthalic acid, maleic acid, phthalic anhydride, maleic anhydride, and particularly mixtures of two or more of such acids or anhydrides, with a polyol selected from ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, diethylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, and neopentyl glycol, preferably two or more of those glycols, having a number average molecular weight in the range of about 1,500 to about 4,000.<br>
One of the most difficult problems encountered in attempting to formulate a polyester resin-based composition into a suitable ophthalmic lens formulation is that of providing the cast and cured composition with sufficient optical clarity, or freedom from optical distortion.  In conventional procedures for the casting of plastic ophthalmic lenses, the reactants used to form the resin are introduced between spaced apart glass or metal mold surfaces and the mold sections are sealed together about their inner periphery by means of a non-reactive, resilient gasket or retainer ring.  Since exothermic materials are employed, the mold outer surfaces are immersed in a cooling fluid, e.g., water, or otherwise cooled to dissipate the heat of polymerization and cross-linking from the mold<br><br>
cavity, and to maintain an optimum polymerization and curing temperature.  During the polymerization reaction, particularly prior to gelation and cross-linking, convection currents are created in the resin, while the resin is in the liquid state, as a result of a substantial temperature differential between the polymerizing resin in the mold cavity and the coolant that surrounds the mold.  These convection currents tend to freeze into the polymer as polymerization proceeds through gelation and curing, resulting in striation or visible "waves" in the cured polyester resin.  Lenses that contain such visible "waves" are unacceptable due to extensive optical distortion or optical non-uniformity.<br>
In accordance with an important feature of the present invention, it has been found that the add'i'f'.ion of an exotheivu depr«=«=:«=s'T»" 
 <br>
methyl styrene preferably is used in an amount in the range of about 2% to about 10% by weight, more preferably about 5.5% to about 7% by weight of the composition.<br>
In addition to the exotherm depressant, it has been found that the unsaturated polyester should include an additive selected from the group consisting of an allylie ester, an acrylate monomer, and mixtures thereof, to provide improved tint speed and/or improved optical uniformity.  Any low color allylic ester and any low color acrylate monomer are suitable as the additive in accordance with the present invention.<br>
Suitable allylic esters include monoallylic esters, diallylic esters and triallylic estsrc, prefei-^t^iy =&gt;n allylic estei?--selected from the group consisting of diallyl phthalate; diethylene glycol bis(allyl carbonate); triallyl cyanurate; and mixtures thereof.  Other suitable allylic esters include allyl acrylate; allyl benzene; triallyl isocyanurate; diallyl maleate; diallyl diglycollate; dimethallyl maleate; allyl benzoate; diallyl adipate; and mixtures thereof. The allylic ester, when incorporated as a composition additive, should be included in an amount in the range of about 1% to about 20%, based on the total weight of the polyester-based lens composition, preferably about 2% to about 10% by weight; and more preferably about 6% to about 10% by weight, with best results achieved at about 7.5% to about 9% by weight.<br><br>
As shown in the following examples, improvements in optical distortion and/or speed of tinting can be achieved with either an allylic ester or an aerylate monomer, when used together with an exotherm depressant.  Best results are achieved with a combination of an allylic ester and an acrylate monomer, particularly since the allylic ester also functions to increase the impact strength of the cross-linked polymer network, and the acrylate additionally functions to increase the abrasion resistance.<br>
Suitable acrylic monomers include monoacrylates, diacrylates, triacrylates, tetraacrylates, pentaacrylates, and the higher poly-functional acrylates.  The preferred acrylate monomer is selected from the group consisting of meihyi wftM^cry7'-te; ethylene glycol 
Other suitable monofunctional acrylates include alkyl and substituted alkyl acrylates and methacrylates, such as ethyl acrylate; cyclohexyl methacrylate; 2-hydroxy ethyl methacrylate; 3-hydroxypropyl acrylate; and mixtures thereof. Additional suitable monofunctional acrylates and methacrylates include any haloalkyl acrylate and methacrylate, such as alpha-bromoethyl acrylate; alpha-chloroethyl acrylate; chloromethyl methacrylate; 2-bromoethyl methacrylate; and mixtures thereof.<br><br>
Aryl acrylates and methacrylates also are suitable as the composition additive, such as 2-naphthyl methacrylate; para-tolyl aerylate; and mixtures thereof. Also suitable are the haloaryl acrylates and methacrylates, such as para-chlorophenyl methacrylate; meta-bromophenyl acrylate; 2,4,6-tribromophenyl acrylate; and mixtures thereof.  The benzyl acrylates and methacrylates which can be used as composition additives, in accordance with the present invention, include benzyl acrylate; benzyl methacrylate and their derivatives, such as para-chlorobenzyl methacrylate; meta-methoxybenzyl methacrylate; para-ethylbenzyl acrylate; and mixtures thereof.<br>
Other suitable polyfunctional acrylates and methacrylates include the polyol diacrylates and dimethacry."dLt'
The acrylate monomer, when incorporated as composition additive, should be included in an amount in the range of about 1% to about 20%, based on the total weight of the polyester-based lens<br><br>
composition, preferably about 2% to about 10% by weight; more preferably about 6% to about 10% by weight, with best results achieved at about 7.5% to about 9% by weight.<br>
The resulting lens will having a relatively high index of refraction (approximately 1.56). a relatively low density (approximately 1.24 grams/cc), and an acceptable ABBE value (approximately 34 to 37). The lens will have sufficient hardness to be able to be surfaced with commonly used optical laboratory equipment. Additionally, by he addition of various ultra-violet absorbing materials (such as Cyanamid Cyasorb UV5411; Ciba Geigy Tinuvin 234; and the like) and color-correcting dye(s), the lens can be made "water vsrhite" and will not appreciably yellow during exposure to sunlight.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a method of casting a cross-linkable casting composition into a curved ophthalmic lens having an index of refraction of at least 1.50 comprising providing the casting composition in a mold cavity formed between adjacent, non-planar mold sides and allowing to polymerize and cross-link the composition, said composition comprising 35-63% by weight of an unsaturated polyester resin; 1 to 20% by weight of an additive selected from the group consisting of an allylic ester monomer, an acrylate and mixtures thereof; and at least 0.01% by weight of an exotherm depressant selected from the group consisting of alpha-methyl styrene; terpinolene; gamma-terpinene; dilauryl thiodipropionate; 4-tert-butylpyrocatechol; 3-methyl catechol and mixtures thereof for depressing the rate of polymerization of said composition, in an<br><br>
amount sufficient to prevent the formation of visible waves in the cured composition.<br>
The following Table of Examples demonstrate how various additive<br>
compositions change the properties of lenses made with various polyster<br>
resin systems. The test methodology was to cast semifinished lenses in<br>
different configurations. One group of semifinished lenses were cast with an<br>
approximately a diopter front curve and a 6 diopter back curve, an edge<br>
thickness of 9-12 mm, and a diameter of 75 mm. Another set of lenses<br>
were cast with 6 diopter front and back curves, an edge thickness of 9-12<br>
mm, and a diameter of 75 mm. For most of the formulations tested,	<br><br>
lenses were also cast with a 4 diopter front curve and 6 diopter back curve with an edge thickness of 9-12 nun, and a diameter of 75 mm.  Amounts are percent by weight.<br>
All formulations were initiated with 0.5 wt% di-(4-tert-butylcyclohexyl) peroxydicarbonate (AKZO Perkadox 16S) and 0.71 wt% of a 50% by weight solution of tert-butyl peroxy-2-ethyl-hexanoate (AKZO Trigonox 21C50) .  The compositions were non-promoted and thermally cured by immersing the molds in a water bath and employing the following cycle:<br><br>
For resin-only systems, the initiators were dissolved in approximately 1 wt% styrene.  In all other cases, the initiators were dissolved in the additive composition.<br>
The resulting lenses from each test were evaluated for the presence of visible optical distortion ("waves")-  If each of the configurations of lenses for a given test group had a majority of lenses without visible optical distortion, the rating was deemed to be "Excellent".  If one configuration had half or a majority of lenses with visible distortion, but the other configuration(s) had a majority without distortion, the rating was deemed to be "Good".  If two configurations had half<br><br>
or a majority of lenses with visible optical distortion and the third configuration had a majority without distortion, the rating was "Fair". If all configurations had a majority of lenses with visible optical distortion, the rating was deemed to be "Poor".<br>
A lens was selected from each test group, processed to uniform thickness of approximately 1.5-2.0 mm.  All lenses were tinted simultaneously in gray tinting solution (BPI Gray) for 5 minutes at approximately 200"F.  Those lenses exhibiting a percent transmission of visible light after tinting of greater than or equal to 65% transmission were rated "V. Slow"; 55% - 64%: "Slow"; 45% - 54%: "Medium"; 35% - 44%: "Fast"; less than or equal to 34% transmission were rated as "V. Fast".<br>
Hardness was measured on lenses from each test group using a Barber Colman type 935 machine. A rating of 80 or more is deemed to be acceptable.<br>
Examples 1 through 4 demonstrate the properties of polyester lenses made from the initiated resin.  Resins A and B are ortho type resins, while resins C and D are iso resins.<br>
Example 5 demonstrates the use of an additive composition to improve the optical clarity of resin C from a "Poor" rating to "Good".  The additive comprised approximately 22 wt% of the total formulation.  In this composition, the additive consisted of triallyl cyanurate (46%) combined with trimethylolpropane polyoxyethylene triacrylate (18%)<br><br>
and alpha-methyl styrene (36%) as the exotherm depressant.<br>
Example 6 demonstrates the use of a different additive composition to improve the optical clarity of resin B from a "Poor" rating to "Excellent". In this example, the allyl compound is diallyl phthalate (31%), the acrylate is 1,6 hexanediol diacrylate (31%) and the exotherm depressant is alpha-methyl styrene (38%).<br>
Examples 7 and 8 show the same additive package used in Example 6 with the two iso resins, C and D.  Slight improvements were noted for both optical clarity ("Poor" improved to "Fair") and tint speed.  Resin C composition changed from "V. Slow" to "slow" and resin D composition changed from •iMcHji^iTi" +-.0 "Fast".<br>
Example 9 shows the effect of a different composition of additive where the allyl com.pound is diethylene glycol bis(allyl carbonate) (50%) blended with the alpha-methyl styrene (50%) exotherm depressant, and without an acrylate monomer.  The additive was 19 wt% of the formulation.  A dramatic improvement in tint speed was noted.  The rating improved from "Medium" to "Very Fast".<br>
Example 10 shows the effect on improving the tint speed of resin A of a mixture of methacrylates and an acrylate, with an alpha-methyl styrene exotherm depressant, and no allylic ester. The composition was ethylene glycol dimethacrylate<br><br>
(40%), dipentaerythritol pentaacrylate (23%), methyl methacrylate (27%) and alpha-methyl styrene (10%). The tint improved from a "Medium" rating to "Fast".<br>
Example 11 demonstrates a dramatic improvement in tint rate for resin A with a mixture of diallyl phthalate (75%) and alpha-methyl styrene (25%), without an acrylate monomer, comprising 10% of the formulation total.  The tint speed increased from "Medium" to "Very Fast".<br>
Example 12 shows a good improvement in the optical clarity and tint rate of resin A by varying the composition additive of Example 11 to diallyl phthalate (25%) and alpha-methyl styrene (75%), the mixture still comprising 10% of the total formulation.  The optical clarity improved from "crvod" to "Excellent" ar.d the tint imorcvccl from "Medium" to "Fast".<br>
Example 13 demonstrates the use of ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (25%) and alpha-methyl styrene (75%) to generate the same improvement in optical clarity of resin A as shown by the mixture used in Example 12; however the tint speed is somewhat reduced.<br>
Examples 14 through 16 show the effect of varying the additive percentage of the whole formulation.  Here the additive is a mixture of diethylene glycol bis(allyl carbonate) (36%), dipentaerythritol pentaacrylate (14%), methyl methacrylate (23%) and alpha-methyl styrene (27%). At the 10% level of additive in the entire composition, no improvement is noted; however as the<br><br>
level is raised to 20% of the total, the tint speed increases from "Medium" to "Fast".  As the composition is increased further to 50%, the tint speed increases further to "V. Fast", but reduction in optical clarity and hardness is noted.<br>
Examples 17 through 20 show the effect of varying the percentage of a different additive composition to the whole formulation.  Here the additive is a mixture of diallyl phthalate (36%), ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (14%), methyl methacrylate (23%) and alpha-methyl styrene (27%). At the 20%, 23%, and 30% additive levels, the tint speed has increased from "Medium" to "Fast" and the optical clarity has improved to "Excellent".  At 50% additive, the optical clarity continues to be "Excellent" while the tint speed increases further to "V. Fast".  The hardness of thJs composition, however, is approaching an unacceptably soft level.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
