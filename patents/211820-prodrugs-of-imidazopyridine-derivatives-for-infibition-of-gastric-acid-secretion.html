Those suitable are water-soluble and water-insoluble acid addition salts with acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, phosphoric acid, nitric acid, sulfuric acid, acetic acid, citric acid, D-gluconic acid, benzoic acid, 2-(4-hydroxybenzoyl)benzoicacid, butyric acid, sulfosalicylicacid, maleic acid, lauric acid, malic acid, fumaric acid, succinic acid, oxalic acid, tartaric acid, embonic acid, stearic acid, toluenesulfonic acid, methanesulfonic acid or 3-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid, where the acids are employed in salt preparation - depending on whether a mono- or polybasic acid is concerned and depending on which salt is desired - in an equimolar quantitative ratio or one differing therefrom.<br>
Pharmacologically intolerable salts which can be initially obtained, for example, as process products in the preparation of the compounds according to the invention on an industrial scale,<br><br>
are converted into pharmacologically tolerable salts by processes known to the person skilled in the art.<br>
It is known to the person skilled in the art that the compounds according to the invention and their salts, if they are isolated, for example, in crystalline form, can contain various amounts of solvents.

and the salts of these compounds.<br>
The compounds according to the invention can thus be prepared as described by way of example in the following examples, or using analogous process steps starting from corresponding starting compounds (see, for example, WO 98/42707, WO 98/54188, EP-A-299470 or Kaminski et al., J. Med. Chem. 1985,28, 876-892 and Angew. Chem. 1996, 108, 589-591). The starting compounds are known or they can be prepared in an analogous manner to the known compounds. The compounds according to the invention can be prepared, for example, according to the following reaction schemes.<br><br>
Scheme 1<br>
In the following scheme, the preparation of compounds of the formula 1 where R1 = CH3l R2 = CH3 R4a or R4b and R5a or R5b = hydroxyl and X = O (oxygen) is outlined by way of example:<br><br>
The above scheme 1 shows by way of example the enantioselective synthesis of a 7,8-diol (R4a or R4b and R5a or R5b are in each case hydroxyl) which can then, if desired, be additionally etherified in a suitable manner.<br>
The group Y in the above compound 3 is a suitable leaving group, for example a halogen atom, preferably chlorine. The acylation is carried out in a manner habitual to the person skilled in the art, preferably using bis(trimethylsilyl)sodium amide or -potassium amide if the leaving group is a chlorine atom.<br>
The oxidation following the acylation is likewise carried out under conditions customary per se using chloranil, atmospheric oxygen or manganese dioxide as an oxidant. For the subsequent<br><br>
protective group removal and cyclization, certain conditions have to be fulfilled with respect to the auxiliary acid to be used. Advantageously, according to the invention formic acid is employed as an auxiliary acid.<br>
The reduction to the diol is likewise carried out under standard conditions (see, for example, WO 98/54188), where, for example, sodium borohydride is employed as areductant, on use of which the indicated 7,8-transdiol can be obtained in over 90% diastereomeric purity. The etherification which follows if desired, which is likewise carried out in a manner habitual per se, leads to the compounds of the formula 1* in which R4a and R5b are hydrogen.<br>
For the preparation of compounds of the formula 1 in which R5a and R5b are hydrogen, instead of compound 3, the starting materials to be used are 3-hydroxy-3~phenylpropionic acid derivatives (appropriately protected on the hydroxyl group) in which Y (analogously to the above scheme) is a suitable leaving group.<br><br>
Scheme 2<br>
In the scheme below, the preparation of compounds of the formula 1 where R1 = CH3, R2 = CH3, R4a or R4b = hydroxyl and X = NH starting from compounds of the formula 2 (see scheme 1) is outlined by way of example:<br><br>
The above scheme 2 likewise, by way of example, is an enantioselective synthesis. Y is again a suitable leaving group, for example a methoxy group. The group G - depending on whether a compound where R5a and R5b = hydrogen or whether a compound R5a or R5b = hydroxyl is desired - is either hydrogen or a hydroxyl group (for example protected by a suitable silyl radical).<br>
The reduction of the keto group with sodium borohydride following the cyclization leads - in the case in which G is a hydroxyl group - in over 90% diastereomeric purity to the 7,8-trans diol. The etherification following if desired, which is carried out according to known processes, leads to the final products of the formula 1* in which R4a and R5b are hydrogen. The corresponding<br><br>
7,8-cis compound is obtained by chromatographic purification from the mother liquor which remains after the separation of the 7,8-trans compound.<br>
The introduction of the "prodrug" radical R' subsequently to the synthesis carried out in accordance with scheme 1 or 2 is carried out in the sense of an acylation reaction starting from compounds of the formula 1 in which at least one of the radicals R4a, R4b, R5a and R5b is a hydroxyl group, by reaction with compounds of the formula R'-Z, in which Z is a suitable leaving group, for example a halogen atom, The reaction is carried out in a manner known per se, e.g. as described in the exampfes, preferabfy in the presence of a suitable auxiliary base. For the preparation of the compounds of the formula 1 in which R4a or R4b is 1-4C-alkoxy or 1-4C-alkoxy-1-4C-alkoxy and R5a or R5b is the radical R5', compounds of the formula 1 in which R4a or R4b is 1-4C-alkoxy or 1-4C-alkoxy-1-4C-alkoxy and R5a or R5b is hydroxyl are reacted with compounds R'-Z. For the preparation of the compounds of the formula 1 in which R4a or R4b is hydroxyl and R5a or R5b is the radical R5", compounds of the formula 1 in which R4a and R4b together are O (oxygen) and R5a or R5b is hydroxyl are reacted with compounds R'-Z. The reduction of the keto group to the hydroxyl group is then carried out. In a similar manner, compounds of the formula 1 are obtained in which the "prodrug" radical is in the 7-position and the hydroxyl or the 1-4C-alkoxy or 1-4C-alkoxy-1-4C-a!koxy radical is in the 8-position.<br>
The isolation and purification of the substances according to the invention are carried out in a manner known per se, for example by distilling off the solvent in vacuo and recrystallizing the residue obtained from a suitable solvent or subjecting it to one of the customary purification methods, such as column chromatography on suitable support material.<br>
Salts are obtained by dissolving the free compound in a suitable solvent, e.g. in a chlorinated hydrocarbon, such as methylene chloride or chloroform, or a low-molecular weight aliphatic alcohol (ethanol, isopropanol) which contains the desired acid, or to which the desired acid is then added. The salts are obtained by filtering, reprecipitating, precipitating with anonsolvent for the addition salt or by evaporating the solvent. Salts obtained can be converted by alkalization or by acidification into the free compounds, from which salts can in turn be prepared. In this manner, pharmacologically nontolerable salts can be converted into pharmacologically tolerable salts.<br>
The pure enantiomers, in particular the pure enantiomers of the formula 1*, which are a preferred subject of the invention, can be obtained in a manner familiar to the person skilled in<br><br>
the art, for example by enantioselective synthesis (see, for example, the scheme), by chromatographic separation on chiral separating columns, by derivatization with chiral auxiliary reagents, subsequent diastereomer separation and removal of the chiral auxiliary group, by salt formation with chiral acids, subsequent resolution of the salts and release of the desired compound from the salt, or by (fractional) crystallization from a suitable solvent. Trans products obtained (e.g. compounds 1* where R4a and R5b = hydrogen) can be converted - at least partly - into the corresponding cis products (e.g. where R4b and R5b = hydrogen) by allowing to stand under acidic conditions (e.g. in 2 equivalents of acid, such as sulfuric acid) in the corresponding alcohol R4a-OH. Likewise, cis products can be converted into the corresponding trans products. The cis and trans products are separated, for example, by chromatography or by crystallization.<br>
The starting compounds of the formula 2 can be prepared starting from compounds known from the literature or with analogous use of processes known from the literature (e.g.Kaminski et al., J. Med. Chem. 1985, 28, 876-892), for example according to the general scheme 3 below:<br><br>
Scheme 3<br>
The scheme below outlines by way of example the preparation of a starting compound 2 where R3 = -COOC2H5.<br><br>
The reaction to give the compound 4 is carried out in a manner such as is known to the person skilled in the art. The reaction of 4 to 5 can be carried out in various ways, for example using the Heck reaction (with Pd(ll), carbon monoxide and ethanol) or by metallation in the 6-position (with lithium or magnesium) and subsequent Grignard reaction. The metallation also offers the possibility of introducing other desired groups R3 in position 6, for example fluorine, chlorine or the carboxyl group. The debenzylation/reduction of the compound 5 is likewise carried out in a manner known per se, for example using hydrogen/Pd(0). If compounds where R3 = -CO-NR5R6 are desired, an appropriate derivatization can be carried out in a manner known per se (conversion of an ester into an amide) at the stage of the compound 5 or after the debenzylation/reduction.<br>
The following examples serve to illustrate the invention further without restricting it. Likewise, further compounds of the formula I whose preparation is not described explicitly can be prepared in an analogous manner or in a manner familiar per se to the person skilled in the art using<br><br>

Commercial applicability<br>
The compounds of the formula 1 and their salts have valuable pharmacological properties which make them commercially utilizable. In particular, they exhibit pronounced inhibition of gastric acid secretion and an excellent gastric and intestinal protective action in warm-blooded animals, in particular humans. In this connection, the compounds according to the invention are distinguished by a high selectivity, an advantageous duration of action, a particularly good enteral activity, the absence of significant side effects and a iarge therapeutic breadth.<br>
"Gastric and intestinal protection" in this connection is understood as meaning the prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal diseases, in particular of gastrointestinal inflammatory diseases and lesions, and of gastric acid-related diseases in mammals including man (such as, for example, gastric ulcers, duodenal ulcers, gastritis, hyperacidic or medicament-related functional gastropathy, reflux esophagitis, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, heartburn), which can be caused, for example, by microorganisms (e.g. Helicobacter pylori), bacterial toxins, medicaments (e.g. certain antiinflammatories and antirheumatics), chemicals (e.g. ethanol), gastric acid or stress situations.<br>
In their excellent properties, the compounds according to the invention surprisingly prove to be markedly superior to the compounds known from the prior art in various models in which the antiulcerogenic and the antisecretory properties are determined. On account of these properties, the compounds of the formula 1 and their pharmacologically tolerable salts are outstandingly suitable for use in human and veterinary medicine, where they are used, in particular, for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of disorders of the stomach and/or intestine.<br>
The invention therefore further relates to the compounds according to the invention for use in the treatment and/or prophylaxis of the abovementioned diseases.<br>
The invention likewise comprises the use of the compounds according to the invention for the production of medicaments which are employed for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of the abovementioned diseases.<br>
The invention furthermore comprises the use of the compounds according to the invention for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of the abovementioned diseases.<br><br>
The invention further relates to medicaments which contain one or more compounds of the formula 1 and/or their pharmacologically tolerable salts.<br>
The medicaments are prepared by processes which are known per se and familiar to the person skilled in the art. As medicaments, the pharmacologically active compounds (= active compounds) according to the invention are either used as such, or preferably in combination with suitable pharmaceutical excipients or vehicles in the form of tablets, coated tablets, capsules, suppositories, patches (e.g. as TTS), emulsions, suspensions or solutions, the active compound content being advantageously between 0.1 and 95% and where a pharmaceutical administration form (e.g. a delayed-release form or an enteric form) exactly tailored to the active compound and/or to the desired onset of action and/or to the duration of action can be obtained by the appropriate choice of the excipients and vehicles.<br>
The person skilled in the art knows, on the basis of his/her expert knowledge which excipients and vehicle are suitable for the desired pharmaceutical formulations. In addition to solvents, gel formers, suppository bases, tablet excipients and other active compound vehicles, it is possible to use, for example, antioxidants, dispersants, emulsifiers, antifoams, flavor corrigents, preservatives, solubilizers, colorants or in particular permeation promoters and complexing agents (e.g. cyclodextrins).<br>
The active compounds can be administered orally, parenterally or percutaneously.<br>
In general, it has proven advantageous in human medicine to administer the active compound(s) in the case of oral administration in a daily dose from approximately 0.01 to approximately 20, preferably 0.05 to 5, in particular 0.1 to 1.5, mg/kg of body weight, if appropriate in the form of a number of, preferably 1 to 4, individual administrations to obtain the desired result. In the case of parenteral treatment, similar or (in particular in the case of intravenous administration of the active compounds), as a rule, lower doses can be used. Any person skilled in the art can easily determine on the basis of his/her expert knowledge the optimal dose and manner of administration of the active compound necessary in each case.<br>
If the compounds according to the invention and/or their salts are to be employed for the treatment of the abovementioned diseases, the pharmaceutical preparations can also contain one or more pharmacologically active constituents of other pharmaceutical groups. The following examples may be mentioned: tranquillizers (for example from the benzodiazepines group, e.g. diazepam),    spasmolytics    (e.g.    bietamiverine    or    camylofine),    anticholinergics    (e.g.<br><br>
oxyphencyclimine or phencarbamide), local anesthetics (e.g. tetracaine or procaine), and, if appropriate, also enzymes, vitamins or amino acids.<br>
To be emphasized in particular in this connection is the combination of the compounds according to the invention with pharmaceuticals which inhibit acid secretion, such as H2 blockers (e.g. cimetidine, ranitidine), H*/K* ATPase inhibitors (e.g. omeprazole, pantoprazole), or furthermore with so-called peripheral anticholinergics (e.g. pirenzepine, telenzepine) and with gastric antagonists with the aim of potentiating the main action in the additive orsuperadditive sense and/or of eliminating or lowering the side effects, or furthermore the combination with antibacterially active substances (such as cephalosporins, tetracyclines, penicillins, macrolides, nitroimidazoles or alternatively bismuth salts) for the control of Helicobacter pylori. Examples of antibacterially active  combination  components which  may  be  mentioned  are  mezlocillin, ampicillin,  amoxicillin,  cefalothin,  cefoxitin,  cefotaxime,   imipenem, gentamycin,  amikacin, erythromycin,   ciprofloxacin,   metronidazole,   clarithromycin,   azithromycin   and   combinations thereof (e.g. clarithromycin + metronidazole).<br><br>
Pharmacology<br>

The compounds according to the invention investigated in the model mentioned below have been provided with numbers which correspond to the numbers of these compounds in the examples.<br>
Testing of the secretion-inhibiting action on perfused rat stomach<br>

Methodology<br>
The abdomen of anesthetized rats (CD rats, female, 200-250 g; 1.5 g/kg ofi.m. urethane) was opened after tracheotomy by a median upper abdominal incision and a PVC catheter was fixed transorally in the esophagus and a further one via the pylorus such that the ends of the tubing just still projected into the gastric lumen. The catheter leading from the pylorus led outwards via a side opening in the right abdominal wall.<br>
After thorough rinsing (about 50-100 ml), a continuous flow of warm physiological NaCI solution (0.5 ml/min, pH 6.8- 6.9; Braun-Unita I) was continuously passed through the stomach at 37°C. The pH in the effluent, in each case collected at an interval of 15 minutes, was determined (pH meter 632, glass electrode EA 147; = 5 mm, Metrohm) and the secreted HCI was determined by titration with a freshly prepared 0.01 N NaOH solution to pH 7 (Dosimat 665 Metrohm).<br><br>
Gastric secretion was stimulated by continuous infusion of 1   ug/kg  (=  1.65 ml/h) of i.v. pentagastrin (left femoral vein) about 30 min after the end of the operation  (i.e.  after determination of 2 preliminary fractions). The substances to be tested were administered intravenously in 1 ml/kg of fluid volume 60 min after the start of the pentagastrin continuous infusion.<br>
The body temperature of the animals was kept at a constant 37.8-38°C by means of infrared irradiation and heating pads (automatic, step-free control via a rectal temperature sensor).<br><br><br>
