				<td>Title: METHODS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF APOLIPOPROTEINS IN TRANSGENIC PLANTS FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to plant genetic engineering methods and to the production of apolipoproteins. More specifically, the present invention relates to methods for the production, of recombinant apolipoproteins in transgenic plants. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In a healthy human body, there is a balance between the delivery and removal of cholesterol. When people have a high level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and low level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), the imbalance results in more cholesterol being deposited in the arteries than that being removed (van Dam, M. J. et al. 2002, Lancet 359: 37-42)). Atherosclerosis, the narrowing or blocking of arteries, is a consequence of the repeated deposit of cholesterol, termed plaque (Major, A. S. et al. 2001, Arterioscler. Thromb. Vase. Biol. 21:1790-1795)).<br>
Lipoproteins can be separated into atererogenetic and vasoprotective lipoproteins. Atherogenetic lipoproteins are generally all apolipoprotein (Apo) B-containing lipoprotein such as very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), intermediate (IDL), low (LDL) or lipoprotein (Lp(a)), whereas vasoprotective lipoproteins are Apo Al containing, such as HDL.<br>
Apo Al, the major protein constituent of HDL, plays a critical role in cholesterol homeostasis. Clinical and population-based studies have demonstrated a remarkable inverse correlation between cardiovascular disease and plasma HDL levels, suggesting Apo Al and HDL help to serve a protective role against atherogenesis (Rubins, H. B. et al. 1993, Am. J. Cartiol. 71: 45-52)). Studies of transgenic mice (Rubin, E. M. et al 1991, Nature 353: 265-267)) and rabbits (Duverger, N. et al 1996, Circulation 94: 713-717)) susceptible to atherosclerosis have shown that expression of human Apo Al inhibits the development of atherosclerosis. This effect may be related to its efficient promotion of cholesterol efflux from cells (Castro, G. et al. 1997, Biochemistry 36: 2243-2249)), the first step in the process of 'reverse cholesterol transport1 (RCT) (Glomset, J. A. 1968, J Lipid Res. 9:155-167)). Apo<br>
I modulates this process by being a preferential acceptor of cellular<br>
cholesterol (Rothblat, G. H. et al. 1999, J Lipid Res. 40: 781-796)), increasing the<br>
"activity of ledthin-cholesterol-acyl-transferase (LCAT) esterifkation of <br>
.ssociated cholesterol several-fold (Jonas, A. 1991, Biochim. Biophys. Acta<br>
.084: 205-220; Mahley, R. W. et al. 1984, J Lipid Res. 25: 1277-1294)), and<br>
ransporting LCAT-derived cholesteryl esters to the liver (Morrison, J. R. et al.<br>
L992, J Biol. Chem. 267:13205-13209)).<br>
Unlike synthetic antihyperlipidemics, such as LIPITORÂ® ^atorvastatin calcium) that act to lower lipid levels in the body by inhibiting the synthesis of cholesterol (Alaupovic, P. et al, 1997, Atherosclerosis 133:123-133)), an infusion of purified Apo AI stimulates cholesterol efflux from tissues into plasma (Navab, M. et al. 2002, Circulation 105: 290-292)). This suggests that Apo AI could stimulate cholesterol efflux from foam cells in the arterial wall and induce regression of atherosclerotic plaque, effectively 'cleaning out' the arteries.<br>
In humans, Apo AI is synthesized in liver and intestinal cells as a non-glycosylated pre-pro-protein (Gordon, J. I. et al 1983, J. Biol Chem. 258: 4037-4044)). The 18 amino acid pre-segment is removed before the protein leaves the cell and the 6 amino acid pro-segment is cleaved post secretion by an unknown protease in the plasma, leaving the mature 243 amino acid protein (Saku, K. et al 1999, Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 29:196-203)).<br>
The Apolipoprotein A-Imilano(Apo AI-M) is the first described molecular variant of human Apo AI (Franceschini, G. et al 1980, J. Clin. Invest. 66: 892-900)). It is characterized by the substitution of Arg 173 with Cys (Weisgrabei, K. H. et al 1983, J. Biol. Chem. 258: 2508-2513)). The mutant apolipoprotein is transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait and 8 generations of carriers have been identified (Gerli, G. C. et al 1984, Hum. Hered. 34:133-140)).<br>
The status of the Apo AI-M carrier individual is characterized by a remarkable reduction in HDL-cholesterol level. In spite of this, the affected subjects do not apparently show any increased risk of arterial disease; indeed, by examination of the genealogic tree it appears that these subjects maybe "protected" from atherosclerosis.<br>
The mechanism of the possible protective effect of Apo AI-M in the carriers seems to be linked to a modification in the structure of the mutant apolipoprotein, with the loss of one alpha-helix and an increased exposure of hydrophobic residues (Franceschini, G. et al. 1985, J. Biol. Chem. 260: 16321-16325). The loss of the tight structure of the multiple alpha-helices leads to an increased flexibility of the molecule, which associates more readily with lipids, compared to normal A-L Moreover, apolipoprotein/lipid complexes are more susceptible to denaturation, thus suggesting that lipid delivery is also improved in the case of the mutant.<br>
The therapeutic use of Apo AI and the Apo AI-M mutant is presently limited by the lack of a method allowing the preparation of said apolipoproteins in sufficient amount and in a suitable form. In particular, the recombinant production of Apo AI has been shown to be very difficult due to its amphiphilic character, autoaggregation, and degradation (Schmidt, H. H. et al. 1997, Protein Expr. Purif. 10: 226-236). At the time of the present invention, recombinant human Apo AI has been expressed in vitro in two eukaryotic systems: Baculovirus transfected Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells (Sorci-Thomas, M. G. et al 1996, J. Lipid Res. 37: 673-683) and stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (Forte, T. M. et al. 1990, Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1047:11-18; Mallory, J. B. et al 1987, J. Biol. Chem. 262: 4241-4247). In the baculovirus system, once the cells are successfully transfected, there is an in-depth screening process before cells with the correct construct can be used for expression. Similarly, CHO cell colonies must undergo a screening process to find stably transfected, high expressing colonies. Additionally, both of these cell types require a relatively long period of time before significant expression is achieved and a much higher level of maintenance than bacteria.<br>
Recombinant expression of proteins in bacterial systems is generally attractive because it can produce large amounts of pure protein quickly and economically There are several reports of Apo AI expression in transformed Escherichia coli (E. coli); however, while certain recent improvements in expression levels have been made (Ryan, R. O. et al. 2003, Protein Expr. Purif. 27: 98-103) in general, these methods provide relatively low yields or the undesirable presence of extraneous affinity tags or secretion<br>
signals(Bergeron, J. et al. 1997, Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1344:139-152; Li, H. H. et al. 2001,}. Lipid Res. 42: 2084-2091; McGuire, K. A. et al. 1996, J. Lipid Res. 37:1519-1528). Moreover, E, coli endotoxins are known to form particularly strong complexes with apolipoproteins (Emancipator et al. (1992) Infect. Immun. 60: 596-601). Reduction or elimination of the toxicity associated with these E. coli endotoxins in pharmaceutical preparations of apoliproteins is highly desirable. The removal of these endotoxins, while technically feasible, involves complex and expensive protein purification methodologies (US Patent 6,506,879) without fully eliminating the human health risk.<br>
The use of plants as bioreactors for the large scale production of recombinant proteins is known to the art, and numerous proteins, including human therapeutic proteins, have been produced. For example, US Patents 4,956,282, 5,550,038 and 5,629,175 disclose the production of y-interferon in plants; US Patents 5,650,307, 5,716,802 and 5,763,748 detail the production of human serum albumin in plants and US Patents 5,202,422, 5,639,947 and 5,959,177 relate to the production of antibodies in plants. One of the significant advantages offered by plant-based recombinant protein production systems is that by increasing the acreage of plants grown, protein production can be inexpensively scaled up to provide for large quantities of protein. By contrast, fermentation and cell culture systems have large space, equipment and energy requirements, rendering scale-up of production costly. However, despite the fact that the use of plants as bioreactors is amply documented, and despite the above mentioned therapeutic applications of apolipoproteins, the prior art provides no methods for the production of apolipoproteins in plants.<br>
In order to offer a practical alternative to the fermentation and cell culture based systems, it is important that plants remain healthy and that apolipoproteins accumulate to significant levels in the plants. In view of the inherent property of apolipoproteins to associate with lipids, recombinantly expressed apolipoproteins may associate with the endogenous plant lipids and thereby interfere with the plant's lipid metabolism. Thus recombinant expression of apolipoproteins may affect the health of the plant. Alternatively, the recombinantly expressed apolipoprotein may fail to accumulate to effective levels, as protective mechanisms may result in degradration of the<br>
apolipoprotein. It thus is unclear whether and how the synthetic capacity of plants may be harnessed to achieve the commercial production of apolipoproteins in plants.<br>
Thus in view of the shortcomings associated with the methods for the recombinant production of apolipoproteins by the prior art, there is a need in the art to improve methods for the production of apolipoproteins. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
As hereinbefore mentioned, the present invention relates to methods for the production of apolipoprotein in transgenic plants. The present inventors have surprisingly found that production of apolipoproteins in plants is not only feasible but also offers substantial advantages over the conventional methodologies. The raw materials for plant based production are more stable, particularly as the protein is produced in plant seeds, and, moreover, are free of bacterial endotoxins. Thus the present invention provides a safe source material for the manufacture of apolipoproteins. It has also been discovered that recombinant expression of apolipoprotein can yield trie native apolipoprotein in more or less pure form at levels that permits commercial scale manufacture of apolipoproteins. Accordingly, pursuant to the present invention a method for the expression of a nucleic acid sequence encoding apolipoprotein in plants is provided in which the method comprises:<br>
(a)	providing   a  chimeric nudeic acid     construct<br>
comprising in the 5' to 3' direction of transcription as operably<br>
linked components:<br>
(i) a nucleic acid sequence capable of controlling expression in plant cells; and<br>
(ii) a nucleic acid sequence encoding an apolipoprotein polypeptide<br>
introducing the chimeric nucleic acid construct into a<br>
plant cell; and<br>
growing the plant cell into a mature plant expressing<br>
apolipoprotein.<br>
The  present inventors have   found   that high  levels   of apolipoprotein expression may be achieved by expressing the recombinant<br>
protein in plant seeds. Accordingly, the present invention provides a method for expressing apolipoprotein in plant seeds comprising:<br>
(a)	providing   a   chimeric   nucleic   acid   construct<br>
comprising in the 5' to 3' direction of transcription as operably<br>
linked components:<br>
(i) a nucleic acid sequence capable of controlling expression in plant seed cells; and<br>
(ii) a nucleic acid sequence encoding an apolipoprotein polypeptide;<br>
(b)	introducing the chimeric nucleic acid construct into a<br>
plant cell; and<br>
(c)	growing the plant cell into a mature plant capable of<br>
setting seed wherein the seed expresses the apolipoprotein.<br>
Terms and Definitions<br>
Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein shall have the same meaning as is commonly understood by one skilled in the art to which the present invention belongs. Where permitted, all patents, applications, published applications, and other publications, including nucleic acid and polypeptide sequences from GenBank, SwissPro and other databases referred to in the disclosure are incorporated by reference in their entirety.<br>
The term "nucleic acid sequence" as used herein refers to a sequence of nucleoside or nucleotide monomers consisting of naturally occurring bases, sugars and intersugar (backbone) linkages. The term also includes modified or substituted sequences comprising non-naturally occurring monomers or portions thereo. The nucleic acid sequences of the present invention may be deoxyribonucleic acid sequences (DNA) or ribonucleic acid sequences (RNA) and may include naturally occurring bases including adenine, guanine, cytosine, thymidine and uracil. The sequences may also contain modified bases. Examples of such modified bases include aza and deaza adenine, guanine, cytosine, thymidine and uracil; and xanthine and hypoxanthine.<br>
The terms "nucleic acid sequence encoding apolipoprotein" and "nucleic acid sequence encoding an apolipoprotein polypeptide", which may be used interchangeably herein, refer to any and all nucleic acid sequences encoding an apolipoprotein polypeptide, including any mammalian apolipoprotein polypeptide and any nucleic acid sequences that encode pro-apolipoprotein and pre-pro-apolipoprotein. As used herein "pro-apolipoprotein" refers to an apolipoprotein polypeptide which includes a polypeptide which is cleaved post-translationally. In native human apolipoprotein the pro-peptide is a 6 amino acid residue polypeptide chain. The term "pre-pro-apolipoprotein" refers to a pro-apolipoprotein molecule additionally comprising an N-terminal signal sequence which facilitates intracellular transport of the polypeptide chain. Nucleic acid sequences encoding an apolipoprotein polypeptide further include any and all nucleic acid sequences which (i) encode polypeptides that are substantially identical to the apolipoprotein polypeptide sequences set forth herein; or (ii) hybridize to any apolipoprotein nucleic acid sequences set forth herein under at least moderately stringent hybridization conditions or which would hybridize thereto under at least moderately stringent conditions but for the use of synonymous codons.<br>
By the term "substantially identical" it is meant that two polypeptide sequences preferably are at least 70% identical, and more preferably are at least 85% identical and most preferably at least 95% identical, for example 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% identical. In order to determine the percentage of identity between two polypeptide sequences the amino acid sequences of such two sequences are aligned, using for example the alignment method of Needleman and Wunsch (J. Mol. Biol, 1970,48: 443), as revised by Smith and Waterman (Adv. Appl. Math., 1981, 2: 482) so that the highest order match is obtained between the two sequences and the number of identical amino acids is determined between the two sequences. Methods to calculate the percentage identity between two amino acid sequences are generally art recognized and include, for example, those described by Carillo and Lipton (SIAM J. Applied Math., 1988, 48:1073) and those described in Computational Molecular Biology, Lesk, e.d. Oxford University Press, New York, 1988, Biocomputing: Informatics and Genomics Projects. Generally,computer programs will be employed for such calculations. Computer programs that maybe used in this regard include/ but are not limited to, GCG (Devereux et alv Nucleic Acids Res., 1984, 12: 387) BLASTP, BLASTN and PASTA (Altschul et al., J. Molec. Biol., 1990: 215: 403). A particularly preferred method for determining the percentage identity between two polypeptides involves the Clustal W algorithm (Thompson, JD, Higgines, DG and Gibson TJ, 1994, Nucleic Acid Res 22(22): 4673-4680 together with the BLOSUM 62 scoring matrix (Henikoff S &amp; Henikoff, JG, 1992, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:10915-10919 using a gap opening penalty of 10 and a gap extension penalty of 0.1, so that the highest order match obtained between two sequences wherein at least 50% of the total length of one of the two sequences is involved in the alignment.<br>
By "At least moderately stringent hybridization conditions" it is meant that conditions are selected which promote selective hybridization between two complementary nucleic acid molecules in solution. Hybridization may occur to all or a portion of a nucleic acid sequence molecule. The hybridizing portion is typically at least 15 (e.g. 20,25, 30,40 or 50) nucleotides in length. Those skilled in the art will recognize that the stability of a nucleic acid duplex, or hybrids, is determined by the Tm, which in sodium containing buffers is a function of the sodium ion concentration and temperature (Tm = 81.5Â°C - 16.6 (Log10 [Na+]) + 0.41(%(G+C) -600/1), or similar equation). Accordingly, the parameters in the wash conditions that determine hybrid stability are sodium ion concentration and temperature. In order to identify molecules that are similar, but not identical, to a known nucleic acid molecule a 1% mismatch may be assumed to result in about a 1Â°C decrease in Tm, for example if nucleic acid molecules are sought that have a &gt;95% identity, the final wash temperature will be reduced by.about 5Â°C. Based on these considerations those skilled in the art will be able to readily select appropriate hybridization conditions. In preferred embodiments, stringent hybridization conditions are selected. By way of example the following conditions may be employed to achieve stringent hybridization: hybridization at 5 x sodium chloride /sodium citrate (SSC)/5 x Denhardt's solution/1.0% SDS at Tm (based on the above equation) - 5Â° C, followed by a wash of 0.2 x SSC/0.1% SDS at 60Â° C. Moderately stringent hybridization<br>
conditions include a washing step in 3 x SSC at 42Â° C. It is understood however that equivalent stringencies may be achieved using alternative buffers, salts and temperatures. Additional guidance regarding hybridization conditions may be found in: Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley &amp; Sons, N.Y., 1989, 6.3.1. - 6.3.6 and in: Sambrook et al, Molecular Cloning, a Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1989, Vol.3.<br>
As used herein the terms "apolipoprotein" and "apolipoprotein polyp eptide" refer to any and all polypeptide sequences of an apolipoprotein including all mammalian apolipoprotein polypeptides and a polypeptide comprising a sequence of amino acid residues which is (i) substantially identical to the amino acid sequences constituting any apolipoprotein polypeptides set forth herein or (ii) encoded by a nucleic acid sequence capable of hybridizing under at least moderately stringent conditions to any nucleic acid sequence encoding apolipoprotein set forth herein or capable of hybridizing under at least moderately stringent conditions to any nucleic acid sequence encoding apolipoprotein set forth herein but for the use of synonymous codons. The terms apolipoprotein and apolipoprotein polypeptide include pro-apolipoprotein polypeptides. The apolipoprotein polypeptide is preferably of human, porcine or bovine origin. In a preferred embodiments these apolipoproteins include, but are not limited to, Apolipoprotein A-IV (Apo AI), Apolipoprotein A-IV (Apo AIV), Apolipoprotein A-V (Apo AV) and Apolipoprotein E (Apo E).<br>
The term "chimeric" as used herein in the context of nucleic acid sequences refers to at least two linked nucleic acid sequences which are not naturally linked. Chimeric nucleic acid sequences include linked nucleic acid sequences of different natural origins. For example a nucleic acid sequence constituting a plant promoter linked to a nucleic acid sequence encoding human apolipoprotein is considered chimeric. Chimeric nucleic acid sequences also may comprise nucleic acid sequences of the same natural origin, provided they are not naturally linked. For example a nucleic acid sequence constituting a promoter obtained from a particular cell-type may be linked to a nucleic acid sequence encoding a polypeptide obtained from that same cell-type, but not normally linked to the nucleic acid sequence<br>
constituting the promoter. Chimeric nucleic acid sequences also include nucleic acid sequences comprising any naturally occurring nucleic acid sequence linked to any non-naturally occurring nucleic acid sequence.<br>
Preparation of recombinant expression vectors comprising chimeric nucleic acid sequences encoding apolipoprotein and a nucleic acid sequencecapable of controlling expression in a plant cell<br>
The nucleic acid sequences encoding apolipoprotein that may be used in accordance with the methods and compositions provided herein may be any nucleic acid sequence encoding an apolipoprotein polypeptide, including any proapolipoprotein and preproapolipoprotein.<br>
There are a number of different apolipoproteins that are found in human blood plasma, and they can act as signals, that cause lipoproteins to act on certain tissues or that activate enzymes that act on those lipoproteins (Lehninger, A. et al. Principles of Biochemistry, second edition, New York, Worth Publishers, 1993). These proteins include but are not limited to alleles and isoforms of apolipoprotein A-I (Apo AI) (see for example Sharpe CR et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 12 (9), 3917-3932 (1984)), Apo AH ((see for example Sharpe CR et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 12 (9), 3917-3932 (1984)), Apo ATV (see for example Elshourbagy NA et al, J. Biol. Chem. 261 (5), 1998-2002 (1986)), Apo AV (see for example Hubacek et al. Physiol. Res. 2004. 53:225-228), Apo B-100 (see for example Law SW et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 83 (21), 8142-8146 (1986)), Apo B-48 (see for example Powell LM et al., CeU 50 (6), 831-840 (1987)) , Apo C-H (see for example Sharpe CR et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 12 (9), 3917-3932 (1984)), Apo C-III (see for example Sharpe CR et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 12 (9), 3917-3932 (1984)), ApoC-IV (see for example Allan CM et al., Genomics 28 (2), 291-300 (1995)), Apo D (Drayna D et al. J. Biol. Chem. 261 (35), 16535-16539 (1986)), Apo E (see for example Brewslow JL et al., J. Biol. Chem. 257 (24), 14639-14641 (1982)) , Apo F (see for example Day JR et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 203 (2), 1146-1151 (1994)), Apo H (see for example Mehdi,H., et al., Gene 108 (2), 293-298 (1991) and Apo L (see for example Duchatea-u,P.N., et al., J. Biol. Chem. 272 (41), 25576-25582 (1997)). Exemplary nucleic acid sequences encoding apolipoprotein are well known to the art and are generally readily available from a diverse variety of mammalian sources including human (see above), porcine (see for example Trieu VN et al., Gene<br>
134 (2), 267-270 (1993)), bovine (see for example Yang,Y.Wv et al. J. Mol. Evol. 32 (6), 469-475 (1991)), ovine (see for example Robertson, J.A., et al., J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 67 (4), 285-292 (1998)) and the like. Human apolipoprotein encoding sequences that may be used include those encoding polypeptide chains set forth as SEQ ID NO.l, 7 and 8. Further non-human apolipoprotein encoding sequences that may be used in accordance of the present invention are set forth in SEQ ID NO: 9-55 and 241-251. The respective corresponding nucleic acid sequences encoding the apolipoprotein polypeptide chains can be readily identified via the Accession identifier numbers provided in Table 1. Using these nucleic acid sequences, additional novel apolipoprotein encoding nucleic acid sequences may be readily identified using techniques known to those of skill in the art. For example libraries, such as expression libraries, cDNA and genomic libraries, may be screened, and databases containing sequence information from sequencing projects may be searched for similar sequences. Alternative methods to isolate additional nucleic acid sequences encoding apolipoprotein polypeptides may be used, and novel sequences may be discovered and used in accordance with the present invention. In preferred embodiments nucleic acid sequences encoding apolipoprotein are human, porcine and bovine apolipoprotein.<br>
Numerous apolipoprotein analogs are known to the prior art (see for example Cheung MC et al., Biochim Biophys Acta. 1988 May 2;960(l):73-82 and Strobl W et al., Pediatr Res. 1988 Aug;24(2):222-8) and may be used in accordance with the present invention. Analogs that may be used herein include human apolipoprotein molecules wherein a variety of natural and synthetic mutations and modifications have been discovered including, but not limited to, point mutations, deletion mutations, frameshift mutations and chemical modifications. In accordance with the present invention in a preferred embodiment, the natural variant known as Apo AI-M is used. Examples of mutations and modifications that may be used in accordance with the present invention include, but are not limited to, those set forth in Table 2.<br>
In preferred embodiments, the nucleic acid sequence encoding apolipoprotein that is used is pro-apolipoprotein.<br>
Alterations to the nucleic acid sequence encoding apolipoprotein to prepare apolipoprotein analogs may be made using a variety of nucleic acid modification techniques known to those skilled in the art, including for example site directed mutagenesis, targeted mutagenesis, random mutagenesis, the addition of organic solvents, gene shuffling or a combination of these and other techniques known to those of skill in the art (Shraishi et al., 1988, Arch. Biochem. Biophys, 358:104-115; Galkin et al., 1997, Protein Eng. 10: 687-690; Carugo et al., 1997, Proteins 28:10-28; Hurley et al., 1996, Biochem, 35 : 5670-5678; Holmberg et al., 1999, Protein Eng. 12 : 851-856).<br>
In accordance herewith the nucleic acid sequence encoding apolipoprotein is linked to a nucleic acid sequence capable of controlling expression of the apolipoprotein polypeptide in a plant cell. Accordingly, the present invention also provides a nucleic acid sequence encoding apolipoprotein linked to a promoter capable of controlling expression in a plant cell. Nucleic acid sequences capable of controlling expression hi plant cells that may be used herein include any plant derived promoter capable of controlling expression of polypeptides in plants. Generally, promoters obtained from dicotyledonous plant species will be used when a dicotyledonous plant is selected in accordance herewith, while a monocotyledonous plant promoter will be used when a monocotyledonous plant species is selected. In one embodiment, a promoter is used which results in the expression of the apolipoprotein polypeptide in the entire plant. Constitutive promoters that may be used include, for example, the 35S cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) promoter (Rothstein et al., 1987, Gene 53: 153-161), the rice actin promoter (McElroy et al., 1990, Plant Cell 2:163-171; US Patent 6,429,357), a ubiquitin promoter, such as the corn ubiquitin promoter (US Patents 5,879,903; 5,273,894), and the parsley ubiquitin promoter (KawaUeck, P. et al., 1993, Plant Mol. Biol. 21:673-684).<br>
In particularly preferred embodiments of the present invention, the apolipoprotein is produced in plant seeds. Production in plants seeds offers flexibility in storage and shipment of apolipoprotein as a raw material, since apolipoprotein retains its activity upon extraction from stored seed. Furthermore, the amount of biomass that needs to be subjected to extraction is<br>
limited due to the relatively low water content present in plant seeds. Accordingly, in a preferred embodiment of the present invention the plant cell is a seed cell and the plant is grown into a mature plant capable of setting seed wherein the seed expresses the apolipoprotein. In a further preferred embodiment the nucleic acid sequence capable of controlling expression in a plant cell is a seed-preferred promoter, such as the phaseolin promoter. In such an embodiment a promoter which results in preferential expression of the apolipoprotein polypeptide in seed tissue is used. "Seed-preferred promoters" in this regard are promoters which control expression of a recombinant protein (i.e. apolipoprotein) so that preferably at least 80% of the total amount of recombinant protein present in the mature plant is present in the seed. More preferably at least 90% of the total amount of recombinant protein present in the mature plant is present in the seed. Most preferably at least 95% of the total amount of recombinant protein present in the mature plant is present in the seed. Seed-preferred promoters that may be used in this regard include, for example, the bean phaseolin promoter (Sengupta-Gopalan et al, 1985, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82: 3320-3324); the Arabidopsis 18 kDa oleosin promoter (US Patent 5,792,922) or the flax oleosin promoter (WO 01/16340); the flax legumin like seed storage protein (linin) promoter (WO 01/16340); the flax 2S storage protein promoter (WO 01/16340); an endosperm preferred promoter such as the Amy32b promoter (Rogers and Milliman, J. Biol. Chem., 1984, 259: 12234-12240, the Amy6-4 promoter (Kursheed and Rogers, J. Biol. Chem., 1988, 263:18953-18960 or the Aleurain promoter (Whittier et al., 1987, Nucleic Acids Res., 15: 2515-2535) or the bean arcelin promoter (jaeger GD, et al., 2002, Nat. Biotechnol..Dec;20:1265-8). New promoters useful in various plants are constantly discovered. Numerous examples of plant promoters may be found in Ohamuro et al. (Biochem. of Pints., 1989,15:1-82).<br>
In preferred embodiments of the present invention the chimeric nucleic acid sequence further comprises a nucleic acid sequence encoding a stabilizing polypeptide linked in reading frame to the nucleic acid sequence encoding the apolipoprotein. The stabilizing polypeptide is used to facilitate protein folding and/or enhance the stable accumulation of the apolipoprotein in plant cells. In addition the stabilizing polypeptide may be used to target the<br>
apolipoprotein to a desired location within the plant cell and/or facilitate purification of the apolipoprotein. Preferably the stabilizing polypeptide is a polypeptide that in the absence of the apolipoprotein can readily be expressed and stably accumulates in transgenic plant cells. The stabilizing polypeptide may be a plant specific or non-plant specific polypeptide. Plant-specific stabilizing polypeptides that can be used in accordance with the present invention include oil body proteins (See below) and thioredoxins, for example, the thioredoxin shown in SEQ ID NO:56. Non-plant specific stabilizing polypeptides that may be used in accordance herewith include green fluorescent protein (GPP) (Davis and Vierstra, 1996, Weeds World 3(2):43-48) (SEQ ID NO:57) and single chain antibodies or fragments thereof. Preferably non-plant specific stabilizing polypeptides are codon optimized for optimal expression in plants.<br>
Single chain antibodies or antibodies that are preferably used herein include single chain antibodies or fragments thereof that facilitate purification of the apolipoprotein. In accordance herewith, for example, a single chain antibody or fragment thereof which is capable of specific assocation with an oil body or oil body protein may be used, thereby permitting copurification of the apolipoprotein with the oil body fraction which can readily be obtained from plant seeds. Preferably the single chain antibody is capable of associating with an oil body protein obtainable from the seed in which the apolipoprotein is expressed, i.e. in an embodiment of the invention in which Arabidopsis plant cells are used, a single chain antibody or fragment thereof is selected which is capable of associating with an Arabidopsis oil body protein. In a further preferred embodiment, the single chain antibody is a single chain FV antibody capable of specifically associating with the 18 kDa oleosin from Arabidopsis thaliana (D9scFv). In the most preferred embodiment, the single chain antibody is shown in SEQ ID NO:240. The term "single chain antibody fragment" (scFv) or "antibody fragment" as used herein means a polypeptide containing a variable light (VJ domain linked to a variable heavy (VH) domain by a peptide linker (L), represented by VL -L-VH. The order of the VL and VH domains can be reversed to obtain polypeptides represented as VH -L-VL. "Domain" is a segment of protein that assumes a discrete function, such as antigen binding or antigen recognition. The single chain antibody fragments for use in the present invention can be<br>
derived from the light and/or heavy chain variable domains of any antibody. Preferably, the light and heavy chain variable domains are specific for the same antigen. Most preferably the antigen is an oil body protein. The individual antibody fragments which are joined to form a multivalent single chain antibody may be directed agairtst the same antigen or can be directed against different antigens. Methodologies to create single chain antibodies are well known to the art. For example single chain antibodies can be created by by screening single chain (scFV) phage display libraries.<br>
Methodologies to create single chain antibodies from phage display libraries are well known to the art. McCarrerty et at (Nature 348: 552-554) demonstrated the use of a phage-display system in which fragments of antibodies were expressed as a fusion protein with a fd phage vector to allow for the expression of single chain antibodies on the surface of the phage. The production of a single chain antibody phage display library can be achieved using for example, trie Recombinant Phage Antibody System developed by Amersham Biosciences and Cambridge Antibody Technology. A more detailed protocol is available from Amersham Biosciences which is sold as in 3 parts including a mouse scFV molecule, and expression module and a detection module. Briefly, the protocol for the production of single chain antibodies is as follows. Messenger RNA can be obtained from either a mouse hybridoma or mouse spleen cells from a mouse that has been immunized with the antigen of interest. The mouse hnybridoma represents the most abundant source for the antibody gene to be cloned as it expressed the heavy and light chain genes for a single antibody but antibodies can also be cloned using spleen cells from an immunized mouse. The mRNA is converted to cDNA using a reverse transcriptase and random hexamer primers. The use of random hexamers will result in cDNA molecules that are sufficient in length to clone the variable regions of the heavy and light chain molecules. After the cDNA molecules are created, primary PCR reactions are performed to amplify the heavy and light variable regions separately. Primers are designed to amplify the heavy or light chain variable region by hybridizing to opposite ends of the chain. Once the variable regions are amplified, the PCR reactions are subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis and gel purified to remove the primers and any extraneous PCR products. Once the heavy and light chain variable regions have been purified<br>
they are assembled into a single gene using a linker. The linker region is designed to ensure that the correct reading frame is maintained between the heavy and light chain. For example, the variable heavy (VH) and variable light (VL) chains may be linked using a (Gly4Ser)3 linker to obtain a single chain antibody fragment (scFv) of approximately 750 base pairs in length. Once the heavy and light chains are assembled with the linker a secondary PCR reaction is performed to amplify the assembled scFV DNA fragments. Primers should be designed to introduce restriction sites to allow for cloning into phagemid expression vectors. For example Sfi I and Not I sites can be added to the 5' and 3' end of these scFv gene for cloning into the pCANTAB 5 E vector (Amersham Biosciences). Once PCR is complete, the DNA fragments should be purified to remove unincorporated primers and dNTPs. This can be achieved using spun-column purification. Once the DNA fragments have been purified and quantified the fragments are digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes to allow for cloning into the appropriate expression vector. The DNA fragments are subsequently ligated into an expression vector, for example pCANTAB 5E (Amersham Biosciences) and introduced into competent E. coli cells. The cells should be grown on appropriate selection media to ensure that only cells containing the expression vector will grow (i.e. using a specific carbon source and antibiotic selection). Once the E. coli is grown, the phagemid-containing colonies are infected with a M13 helper phage (i.e. KO7 - Amersham Biosciences) to yield recombinant phage which display the scFv fragments. The M13 phage will initiate phage replication and complete phage particles will be produced and released from the cells, expressing scFv species on their surface. The phage displaying the correct scFv antibodies are identified by panning using the specific antigen. To eliminate the non-specific phage, the culture of recombinant phage can be transferred to an antigen-coated support (i.e. a flask or a tube), and washed. Only those phage displaying the correct scFv will be bound to the support. A susceptible strain of E. coli is subsequently infected with the phage bound to the antigen-coated support. The phage can be enriched by rescuing with the helper phage and panning against the antigen multiple times or can be plated directly onto a solid medium without further enrichment. The E. coli cells that have been infected with the phage selected against the appropriate antigen are plated and individual colonies are picked. Phage, from<br>
the individual colonies, are then assayed using for example the ELISA assay (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). Phage antibodies which are positive using the ELISA assay can then be used to infect E. coli HB2151 cells for the production of soluble recombinant antibodies. Once the appropriate clones are selected the sequence of the scFv antibody gene can be identified and used for the present invention,<br>
The stabilizing protein may be linked to the apolipoprotein via a linker which can be cleaved, to release the apolipoprotein in its free native form. Linkers that may be included in this regard include peptide sequences recognized by Factor Xa, IgA protease, or entorokinase. In a particularly preferred embodiment the linker encodes a chymosin pro-sequence which may be cleaved with mature chymosin as set forth in PCT Patent Application WO 98/49326.<br>
In preferred embodiments the chimeric nucleic acid sequence further comprises a "targeting signal". Targeting signal as used herein means any amino acid sequence capable of directing the apolipoprotein polypeptide, when expressed, to a desired location within the plant cell. Suitable targeting signals that may be used herein include those capable of targeting the apolipoprotein polypeptide to the endoplasmic renculum or a storage vesicle derived from the endoplasmic reticulum, such as an oil body, and the apoplast.<br>
In order to achieve accumulation of the apolipoprotein in the ER or an ER-derived storage vesicle, the polypeptide encoding the polypeptide encoding the apolipoprotein is linked to a targeting signal which causes the apolipoprotein to be retained in the ER or an ER-derived storage vesicle. In a preferred embodiment of ttie present invention, the targeting signal that is capable of retaining the apolipoprotein in the ER contains a C-terminal ER-retention motif. Examples of such C-terminal ER-retention motifs include KDEL, HDEL, DDEL, ADEL and SDEL sequences. Other examples include HDEF (Lehmann et al., 2001, Plant Physiol. 127(2): 436-439), or two arginine residues close to the N-terminus located at positions 2 and 3, 3 and 4, or 4 and 5 (Abstract from Plant Biology 2001 Program, ASPB, July 2001, Providence, Rhode Island, USA). Nucleic acid sequences encoding a C-terminal retention motif are preferably linked to the nucleic acid sequence encoding the<br>
apolipoprotein in such a manner that the polypeptide capable of retaining the apolipoprotein in the ER is linked to the C-terminal end of the apolipoprotein polypeptide.<br>
In embodiments of the present invention in which the apolipoprotein is retained in the ER the chimeric nucleic acid sequence additionally may contain a nucleic sequence which targets the nucleic acid sequence to the endomembrane system ("signal peptide"). In embodiments of the present invention in which the apolipoprotein polypeptide is retained in the ER using a sequence, such as KDEL, HDEL or SDEL polypeptide, it is particularly desirable to include a nucleic acid sequence encoding a signal peptide. Exemplary signal peptides that may be used herein include the tobacco pathogenesis related protein (PR-S) signal sequence (SEQ.ID.NO:58) (Sijmons et al., 1990, Bio /technology, 8:217-221), lectin signal sequence (Boehn et al., 2000, Transgenic Res, 9(6):477-86), signal sequence from the hydroxyproline-rich glycoprotein from Phaseolus vulgaris (Yan et al., 1997, Plant Phyiol. 115(3):915-24 and Corbin et al., 1987, Mol CeU Biol 7(12):4337-44), potato patatin signal sequence (Iturriaga, G et al., 1989, Plant Cell 1:381-390 and Sevan et al., 1986, Nuc. Acids Res. 41:4625-4638.) and the barley alpha amylase signal sequence (Rasmussen and Johansson, 1992, Plant Mol. Biol. 18(2):423-7). Example No. 3 herein shows accumulation of the apolipoprotein in the ER.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, the apoliprotein polypeptide is linked to a polypeptide that is capable of retaining the apolipoprotein polypeptide in an ER-derived storage vesicle. In a preferred embodiment, the ER derived storage vesicle is an oil body and the apolipoprotein is linked, to an oil body protein. Oil body proteins that may be used in this regard include any protein that naturally associates with an oil body (see SEQ ID NOs:59-137 in Table 3). The respective corresponding nucleic acid sequences encoding the oil body protein polypeptide chains can be readily identified via the Accession identifier numbers provided in Table 3. Using these nucleic acid sequences, additional novel oil body proteins encoding nucleic acid sequences may be readily identified using techniques known to those of skill in the art. For example libraries, such as expression libraries, cDNA and genomic libraries, may be screened, and databases<br>
containing sequence information from sequencing projects may be searched for similar sequences. Alternative methods to isolate additional nucleic acid sequences encoding oil body protein polypeptides may be used, and novel sequences may be discovered and used in accordance with the present invention. Oil body proteins that are particularly preferred are oleosins, for example a corn oleosin (Bowman-Vance et al., 1987, J. Biol. Chem. 262:11275-11279; Qu et al., 1990, J. Biol. Chem. 265: 2238-2243 or Brassica (Lee et alv 1991, Plant Physiol. 96: 1395-1397), caleosins, see for example Genbank accession number AF067857) and steroleosins (Lin et al., 2002 Plant Physiol. 128(4):1200-11). In a further preferred embodiment, the oil body protein is a plant oleosin and shares sequence similarity with other plant oleosins such as the oleosin isolated from Arabidopsis thaliana (SEQ ID NO:138) or Brassica napus (SEQ ID NO: 139). In another embodiment, the oil body protein is a caleosin or calcium binding protein from plant, fungal or other sources and shares sequence homology with plant caleosins such as the caleosin isolated from Arabidopsis thaliana (SEQ ID NO:140 and SEQ ID NO:141) In another embodiment the oil body protein is a steroleosin (SEQ ID NO:142), a sterol binding dehydrogenase (Lin L-J et al, (2002) Plant Physiol 128: 1200-1211). This embodiment of the present invention is exemplified in Example No. 3.<br>
In addition, in accordance with the present invention, the apolipoprotein may also be targeted to an oil body by expressing the apolipoprotein in such a manner that the apolipoprotein does not include a targeting signal, provided however, that the nucleic acid sequence encoding the apolipoprotein comprises an apolipoprotein pro-peptide. This embodiment of the present invention is exemplified in Example No. 3.<br>
Polypeptides capable of retaining the apolipoprotein in the ER or an ER derived storage vesicle are typically not cleaved and the apolipoprotein may accumulate in the form of a fusion protein, which is, for example, typically the case when a KDEL retention signal is used to retain the polypeptide in the ER or when an oil body protein is used to retain the polypeptide in an oil body.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the apolipoprotein polypeptide is expressed in such a manner the polypeptide accumulates in the apoplast. In order to achieve such accumulation the<br>
chimeric nucleic acid sequence preferable comprises a targeting sequence capable of directing the apoliprotein polypeptide to the ER ("signal peptide"). Exemplary signal peptides that may be used herein include the hereinbefore mentioned tobacco pathogenesis related protein (PR-S) signal sequence (SEQ.ID.NO:58) (Sijmons et al., 1990, Bio/technology, 8:217-221), lectin signal sequence (Boehn et al., 2000, Transgenic Res, 9(6):477-86), signal sequence from the hydroxyproline-rich glycoprotein from Phaseolus vulgaris (Yan et al., 1997, Plant Phyiol. 115(3):915-24 and Corbin et al., 1987, Mol Cell Biol 7(12):4337-44), potato patatin signal sequence (Iturriaga, G et al., 1989, Plant Cell 1:381-390 and Bevan et al., 1986, Nuc. Acids Res. 41:4625-4638.) and the barley alpha amylase signal sequence (Rasmussen and Johansson, 1992, Plant Mol. Biol. 18(2):423-7). Such targeting signals may in vivo be cleaved off from the apolipoprotein polypeptide, which for example is typically the case when an apoplast targeting signal, such as the tobacco pathogenesis related protein-S (PR-S) signal sequence (Sijmons et al., 1990, Bio/technology, 8:217-221) is used. Other signal peptides can be predicted using the SignalP World Wide Web server (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/) which predicts the presence and location of signal peptide cleavage sites in amino acid sequences from different organisms. In general there is little conservation of the primary amino acid sequence, although general physiochemical properties are conserved to some extent. The generic structure of signal peptides has 3 regions, the short ammo-terminal "n-region" contains positively charged residues, the central hydrophobia "h-region" ranges in size from 7 to 15 amino acids and the carboxy-termmal "c-region" contains polar amino acids and a cleavage site that is recognized by membrane bound signal peptidase enzymes (Nakai K, 2000, Advances in Protein Chem 54:277-344). A targeting signal that also may be used in accordance herewith includes the native apolipoprotein signal sequence (18 amino acids in length in case of the human sequence). In preferred embodiments hereof an N-terminally located apoplast targeting sequence, such as the hereinbefore mentioned tobacco PR-S sequence is used combined with a C-terminally located ER retention sequence such as the KDEL sequence.<br>
In yet a further preferred embodiment, the nucleic acid sequence encoding the apolipoprotein is   expressed in such a manner that the<br>
apolipoprotein accumulates in the cytoplasm. In such an embodiment the nucleic acid sequence does not comprise a targeting signal. Preferably in such an embodiment the apolipoprotein comprises a further stabilizing polypeptide, such as green fluorescent protein (GFP).<br>
The chimeric nucleic acid sequence may also comprise IslÂ­and/or C-terminal polypeptide extensions. Such extensions may be used to stabilize and/or assist in folding of the apolipoprotein polypeptide chain or they may facilitate targeting to a compartment in the cell, for example the oil body. Polypeptide extensions that may be used in this regard include for example a nucleic acid sequence encoding a single chain antibody, or a nucleic acid sequence encoding green fluorescent protein (Davis and Vierstra, 1996, Weeds World 3(2):43-48), or combinations of such polypeptides. Single chain antibody extensions that are particularly desirable include those that permit association of the apoliprotein with an oil body in order to facilitate purification of the apolipoprotein in association with the oil body fraction. Such extensions are preferably included in embodiments of the present invention in which the apolipoprotein is expressed in the plant seed and targeted within the seed cell to the ER or to the apoplast.<br>
In a further embodiment, a cleavage site may be located upstream of the N-terminus or downstream of the C-terminus of the Apolipoprotein A-I peptide allowing for the Apolipoprotein A-I polypeptide to be cleaved from the fusion partner, thereby obtaining isolated Apolipoprotein A-I. Examples of such cleavage sites can be found in WO 98/49326 (Method for the cleavage of fusion proteins) and related applications and LaVallie et al. (1994) Enzymatic and chemical cleavage of fusion proteins In Current Protocols in Molecular Biology pp 16.4.5-16.4.17, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York NY. In a preferred embodiment, the cleavage site is KLIP 8 (SEQ ID NO: 143) which is cleavable by aspartic proteases including chymosin. In a further preferred embodiment, an extra 30 methionine residue is added to the N-terminus of the Apo AI polypeptide or pro-Apo AI polypeptide.<br>
The invention further provides methods for the separation of heterologous proteins from host cell components by partitioning of the oil body fraction and subsequent release of the heterologous protein via specific cleavage of the heterologous protein - oil body protein fusion. Optionally a cleavage site may be located upstream of the N-terminus and downstream of the C-terminus of the heterologous polypeptide allowing the fusion polypeptide to be cleaved and separated by phase separation into its component peptides.<br>
The nucleic acid sequence encoding apolipoprotein may be altered/ to improve expression levels for example, by optimizing the nucleic acid sequence in accordance with the preferred codon usage for a particular plant cell type which is selected for the expression of the apolipoprotein polypeptide, or by altering motifs known to destabilize mRNAs (see for example: PCT Patent Application 97/02352). Comparison of the codon usage of the nucleic acid sequence encoding tine apolipoprotein polypeptide with the codon usage of the plant cell type will enable the identification of codons that may be changed. Construction of synthetic genes by altering the codon usage is described in for example PCT Patent Application 93/07278.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the nucleic acid sequence encoding apolipoprotein that is used is represented by SEQ.ID.NO 1, SEQ.ID.NO. 3 or SEQ.ID.NO. 5.<br>
Certain genetic elements capable of enhancing expression of the apolipoprotein polypeptide may be used herein. These elements include the untranslated leader sequences from certain viruses, such as the AMV leader sequence Qobling and Gehrke, 1987, Mature, 325: 622-625) and the intron associated with the maize ubiquitin promoter (US Patent 5,504,200). Generally the chimeric nucleic acid sequence will be prepared so that genetic elements capable of enhancing expression will be located 5' to the nucleic acid sequence encoding the apolipoprotein polypeptide.<br>
In accordance with the present invention the chimeric nucleic acid sequences comprising a promoter capable of controlling expression in plant linked to a nucleic acid sequence encoding an apolipoprotein polypeptide can be integrated into a recombinant expression vector which ensures good expression in the cell. Accordingly, the present invention includes a recombinant expression vector comprising in the 5' to 3' direction of transcription as operably linked components:<br>
(i)   a nucleic acid sequence capable of controlling expression in plant cells; and<br>
(ii) a nucleic acid sequence encoding an apolipoprotein<br>
polyp eptide;<br>
wherein the expression vector is suitable for expression in a plant cell. The term "suitable for expression in a plant cell" means that the recombinant expression vector comprises the chirneric nucleic acid sequence of the present invention linked to genetic elements required to achieve expression in a plant cell. Genetic elements that may be included in the expression vector in this regard include a transcriptional termination region, one or more nucleic acid sequences encoding marker genes, one or more origins of replication and the like. In preferred embodiments, the expression vector further comprises genetic elements required for the integration of the vector or a portion thereof in the plant cell's nuclear genome, for example the T-DNA left and right border sequences which facilitate the integration into the plant's nuclear genome in embodiments of the invention in which plant cells are transformed using Agrobacterium. In a further preferred embodiment said plant cell is a plant seed cell.<br>
As hereinbefore mentioned, the recombinant expression vector generally comprises a transcriptional terminator which besides serving as a signal for transcription termination further may serve as a protective element capable of extending the mRNA half life (Guarneros et al., 1982, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 79: 238-242). The transcriptional terminator is generally from about 200 nucleotides to about 1000 nucleotides and the expression vector is prepared so that the transcriptional terminator is located 3' of the nucleic acid sequence encoding apolipoprotein. Termination sequences that may be used herein include, for example, the nopaline termination region (Bevan et al., 1983, Nucl. Acids. Res., 11: 369-385), the phaseolin terminator (van der Geest et al., 1994, Plant J. 6: 413-423), the arcelin terminator Qaeger GD, et al., 2002, Nat. Biotechnol. 20:1265-8), the terminator for the octopine synthase genes of Agrobacterium tumefaciens or other similarly functioning elements. Transcriptional terminators may be obtained as described by An (An, 1987, Methods inEnzym. 153: 292).<br>
Pursuant to the present invention the expression vector may further contain a marker gene. Marker genes that may be used in accordance with the present invention include all genes that allow the distinction of transformed cells from non-transformed cells, including all selectable and screenable marker genes. A marker gene may be a resistance marker such as an antibiotic resistance marker against, for example, kanamycin (US Patent 6,174,724), ampicillin, G418, bleomycin, hygromycin which allows selection of a trait by chemical means or a tolerance marker against a chemical agent, such as the normally phytotoxic sugar mannose (Negrotto et al., 2000, Plant Cell Rep. 19: 798-803). Other convenient markers that may be used herein include markers capable of conveying resistance against herbicides such as glyphosate (US Patents 4,940,935; 5,188,642), phosphinothricin (US Patent 5,879,903) or sulphonyl ureas (US Patent 5,633,437). Resistance markers, when linked in close proximity to nucleic acid sequence encoding the apolipoprotein polypeptide, may be used to maintain selection pressure on a population of plant cells or plants that have not lost the nucleic acid sequence encoding the apolipoprotein polypeptide. Screenable markers that may be employed to identify transformants through visual inspection include (3-glucuronidase (GUS) (US Patents 5,268,463 and 5,599,670) and green fluorescent protein (GPP) (Niedz et al., 1995, Plant Cell Rep., 14:403).<br>
Recombinant vectors suitable for the introduction of nucleic acid sequences into plants include Agrobacterium and Rhizobium based vectors, such as the Ti and Ri plasmids, including for example pBIN19 (Bevan, Nucl. Acid. Res., 1984, 22: 8711-8721), pGKBS (Bouchez et al., 1993, C R Acad. Sci. Paris, Life Sciences, 316:1188-1193), the pCGN series of binary vectors (McBride and Summerfelt, 1990, Plant Mol. Biol, 14:269-276) and other binary vectors (e.g. US Patent 4,940,838).<br>
The recombinant expression vectors of the present invention may be prepared in accordance with methodologies well known to those skilled in the art of molecular biology. Such preparation will typically involve the bacterial species Escherichia coli as an intermediairy cloning host. The preparation of the E. coli vectors as well as the plant transformation vectors may be accomplished using commonly known techniques such as restriction digestion, ligation, gelectrophoresis, DNA sequencing, the Polymerase Chain<br>
Reaction (PCR) and other methodologies. A wide variety of cloning vectors is available to perform the necessary steps required to prepare a recombinant expression vector. Among the vectors with a replication system functional in E, coli, are vectors such as pBR322, the pUC series of vectors, the M13mp series of vectors, pBluescript etc. Typically, these cloning vectors contain a marker allowing selection of transformed cells. Nucleic acid sequences may be introduced in these vectors, and the vectors may be introduced in Â£. coli grown in an appropriate medium. Recombinant expression vectors may readily be recovered from cells upon harvesting and lysing of the cells. Further, general guidance with respect to the preparation of recombinant vectors may be found in, for example: Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning, a Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1989, Vol.3.<br>

In accordance herewith in a preferred embodiment plant species or plant cells from oil seed plants are used. Oil seed plants that may be used herein include peanut (Arachis hypogaea); mustard (Brassica spp. and Sinapis alba); rapeseed (Brassica spp.); chickpea (Cicer arietinum); soybean (Glycine max); cotton (Gossypium hirsutum); sunflower (Helianthus annuus); (Lentil Lens culinaris); linseed/ flax (Linum usitatissimum.); white clover (Trifolium repens);<br>
olive (Olea eurpaea); oil palm (Elaeis guineeis); safflower (Carthamus tinctorius) and narbon bean (Vicia narbonesis).<br>
In accordance herewith in a particularly preferred embodiment Arabidopsis, flax or safflower is used.<br>
Methodologies to introduce plant recombinant expression vectors into a plant cell, also referred to herein as "transformation", are well known to the art and typically vary depending on the plant cell that is selected. General techniques to introduce recombinant expression vectors in cells include, electroporation; chemically mediated techniques, for example CaCl2 mediated nucleic acid uptake; particle bombardment (biolistics); the use of naturally infective nucleic acid sequences, for example virally derived nucleic acid sequences, or Agrobacterium or Rhizobium derived sequences, polyethylene glycol (PEG) mediated nucleic acid uptake, microinjection and the use of silicone carbide whiskers.<br>
In preferred embodiments, a transformation methodology is selected which will allow the integration of the chimeric nucleic acid sequence in the plant cell's genome, and preferably the plant cell's nuclear genome. In accordance herewith this is considered particularly desirable as the use of such a methodology will result in the transfer of the chimeric nucleic acid sequence to progeny plants upon sexual reproduction. Transformation methods that maybe used in this regard include biolistics and Agrobacterium mediated methods.<br>
Transformation methodologies for dicotyledenous plant species are well known. Generally, Agrobacterium mediated transformation is used because of its high efficiency, as well as the general susceptibility by many, if not all, dicotyledenous plant species. Agrobacterium transformation generally involves the transfer of a binary vector, such as one of the hereinbefore mentioned binary vectors, comprising the chimeric nucleic acid sequence of the present invention from E. coli to a suitable Agrobacterium strain (e.g. EHA101 and LBA4404) by, for example, tri-parental mating with an E. coli strain carrying the recombinant binary vector and an E. coli strain carrying a helper plasmid capable of mobilizing the binary vector to the target Agrobacterium strain, or by DNA transformation of the Agrobacterium strain (Hofgen et al., Nucl. Acids. Res., 1988,16:9877). Other techniques that may be<br>
used to transform dicotyledenous plant cells include "biolistics (Sanford, 1988, Trends in Biotechn. 6:299-302); electroporation (Fromrn et al., 1985, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA., 82:5824-5828); PEG mediated DNA uptake (Potrykus et al., 1985, Mol. Gen. Genetics, 199:169-177); microirvjection (Reich et al., Bio/Techn., 1986,4:1001-1004); and silicone carbide whiskers (Kaeppler et al.,<br>
1990,	Plant Cell Rep., 9:415-418) or in planta transformation using, for<br>
example, a flower dipping methodology (dough and Bent, 1998, Plant J.,<br>
16:735-743).<br>
Monocotyledonous plant species may be transformed using a variety of methodologies including particle bombardment (Christou et al.,<br>
1991,	Biotechn. 9:957-962; Weeks et al., Plant Physiol., 1993, 102:1077-1084;<br>
Gordon-Kamm et al., Plant Cell, 1990, 2:5603-618); PEG mediated DNA<br>
uptake (European Patents 0292 435; 0392 225) or Agrobacterium mediated<br>
transformation (Goto-Fumiyuki et al., 1999, Nature-Biotech. 17:282-286).<br>
The exact plant transformation methodology may vary somewhat depending on the plant species and tlxe plant cell type (e.g. seedling derived cell types such as hypocotyls and cotyledons or embryonic tissue) that is selected as the cell target for transformation. As hereinbefore mentioned in a particularly preferred embodiment safflower is used. A methodology to obtain safflower transformants is available in Baker and Dyer (Plant Cell Rep., 1996, 16:106-110). Additional plant species specific transformation protocols may be found in: Biotechnology in Agriculture and Forestry 46: Transgenic Crops I (Y.P.S. Bajaj ed.), Springer-Verlag, New York (1999), and Biotechnology in Agriculture and Forestry 47: Transgenic Crops II (Y.P.S. Bajaj ed.), Springer-Verlag, New York (2001).<br>
Following transformation, the plant cells are grown and upon the emergence of differentiating tissue, such as shoots and roots, mature plants are regenerated. Typically a plurality of plants is regenerated. Methodologies to regenerate plants are generally plant species and cell type dependent and will be known to those skilled in the art. Further guidance with respect to plant tissue culture may be found in, for example: Plant Cell and Tissue Culture, 1994, Vasil and Thorpe Eds., Kluwer Academic Publishers; and in: Plant Cell Culture Protocols (Methods in Molecular Biology 111), 1999, Hall Eds, Humana Press.<br>
In one aspect, the present invention provides a method of obtaining plant seed comprising apolipoprotein. Accordingly, the present invention provides a method for obtaining plant seed comprising apolipoprotein comprising:<br>
(a)	providing  a  chimeric  nucleic  acid     construct<br>
comprising in the 5' to 3' direction of transcription as operably<br>
linked components:<br>
(i) a nucleic acid sequence capable of controlling expression in plant seed cells; and<br>
(ii) a nucleic acid sequence encoding an apolipoprotein polyp ep tide;<br>
introducing the chimeric nucleic acid construct into a<br>
plant cell;<br>
growing the plant cell into a mature plant; and<br>
(d)	obtaining seed from said plant wherein the seed<br>
comprises apolipoprotein.<br>
The seeds may be used to obtain a population of progeny plants each comprising a plurality of seeds expressing apolipoprotein. In a preferred embodiment at least approximately 0.25% of the total seed protein is apolipoprotein. More preferably least approximately 0.5% of the total seed protein is apolipoprotein. Most preferably at least approximately 1.0% of the total seed protein is apolipoprotein.<br>
In preferred embodiments, a plurality of transformed plants is obtained, grown, and screened for the presence of the desired chimeric nucleic acid sequence, the presence of which in putative transformants may be tested by, for example, growth on a selective medium, where herbicide resistance markers are used, by direct application of the herbicide to the plant, or by Southern blotting. If the presence of the chimeric nucleic acid sequence is detected, transformed plants may be selected to generate progeny and ultimately mature plants comprising a plurality of seeds comprising the desired chimeric nucleic acid sequence. Such seeds may be used to isolate apolipoprotein or they may be planted to generate two or more subsequent generations. It will generally be desirable to plant a plurality of rransgenic seeds to obtain a population of transgenic plants, each comprising seeds<br>
omprising a chimeric nucleic acid sequence encoding apolipoprotein. Furthermore, it will generally be desirable to ensure homozygosity in the plants to ensure continued inheritance of the recombinant polypeptide. Methods for selecting homozygous plants are well known to those skilled in the art. Methods for obtaining homozygous plants that may be used include the preparation and transformation of haploid cells or tissues followed by the regeneration of haploid plantlets and subsequent conversion to diploid plants for example by the treatment with colchine or other microtubule disrupting agents. Plants may be grown in accordance with otherwise conventional agricultural practices.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention also provides plants capable of setting seed expressing apolipoprotein. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the plants capable of setting seed comprise a chimeric nucleic acid sequence comprising in the 5' to 3' direction of transcription:<br>
a first nucleic acid sequence capable of controlling<br>
expression in a plant seed cell operatively linked to;<br>
a  second  nucleic  acid  sequence   encoding   an<br>
apolipoprotein polypeptide,  wherein  the  seed  contains<br>
apolipoprotein.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the chimeric nucleic acid sequence is stably integrated in the plant's nuclear genome.<br>
In yet another aspect, the present invention provides plant seeds expressing apolipoprotein. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the plant seeds comprise a chimeric nucleic acid sequence comprising in the 5' to 3' direction of transcription:<br>
a first nucleic acid sequence capable of controlling<br>
expression in a plant seed cell operatively linked to;<br>
a  second  nucleic  acid  sequence   encoding   an<br>
apolipoprotein polypeptide.<br>
The apolipoprotein polypeptide may be present in a variety of different types of seed cells including, for example, the hypocotyls and the embryonic axis, including in the embryonic roots and embryonic leafs, and where monocotyledonous plant species, including cereals and corn, are used in the endosperm tissue.<br>
Once the plants have been obtained the apolipoprotein protein may be extracted and obtained from the plant in a more or less pure form.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a method for preparing substantially pure apolipoprotein comprising:<br>
(a)	providing  a  chimeric  nucleic   acid     construct<br>
comprising in the 5' to 3' direction of transcription as operably<br>
linked components:<br>
(i) a nucleic acid sequence capable  of controlling<br>
expression in plant seed cells; and<br>
(ii) a nucleic acid sequence encoding an apolipoprotein polypeptide;<br>
introducing the chimeric nucleic acid construct into a<br>
plant cell;<br>
growing the plant cell into a mature plant; and<br>
obtaining seed from said plant wherein the seed comprises<br>
apolipoprotein; and<br>
(e)	separating apolipoprotein from the plant seed<br>
constituents to obtain substantially pure apolipoprotein. In order to separate the apolipoprotein from the seed constituents, plant seeds may be ground using any comminuting process resulting in a substantial disruption of the seed cell membrane and cell walls. Both dry and wet milling conditions (US Patent 3,971,856; Lawhon et al., 1977, J. Am. Oil Chem. Soc., 63:533-534) may be used. Suitable milling equipment in this regard include colloid mills, disc mills, IKA mills, industrial scale homogenizers and the like. The selection of the milling equipment will depend on the seed type and throughput requirements. Solid seed contaminant such as seed hulls, fibrous materials, undissolved carbohydrates, proteins and other water insoluble contaminants may be removed from the seed fraction using for example size-exclusion based methodologies, such as filtering or gravitational based processes such as centrifugation. In preferred embodiments, the use of organic solvents commonly used in oil extraction, such as hexane, is avoided because such solvents may damage the apolipoprotein polypeptide. As hereinbefore mentioned in preferred embodiments of the present invention the apoliprotein is prepared in a<br>
manner that permits association of the apolipoprotein polypeptide with seed oil bodies. Accordingly, seed oil bodies comprising the apolipoprotein may be prepared following comminuting of the seed using for example the methodologies detailed in US Patent 6,146,645. Thus the present invention also includes substantially pure oil bodies comprising apolipoprotein obtained from plant seed. The oil bodies may be used as a refined plant seed fraction to further purify apolipoprotein. Substantially pure apolipoprotein may be recovered from seed using a variety of additional purification methodologies such as centrifugation based techniques; size exclusion based methodologies, including for example membrane ultrafiltration and crossflow ultrafiltration; and chromatographic techniques, including for example ion-exchange chromatography, size exclusion chromatography, affinity chromatography, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC), hydrophobic interaction chromatography and the like. Generally, a combination of such techniques will be used to obtain substantially pure apolipoprotein. A preferred methodology to obtain substantially pure apoliprotein in its native form from transgenic plant seeds is further detailed in Example 6 herein. Thus the present invention also includes substantially pure apolipoprotein obtained from a plant.<br>
Pharmaceutical apolipoprotein formulations may be prepared from the purified apolipoprotein and such formulations may be used to treat vascular diseases. Generally the purified apolipoprotein will be admixed with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent in amounts sufficient to exert a therapeutically useful effect in the absence of undesirable side effects on the patient treated. To formulate an apolipoprotein composition, the weight fraction of apolipoprotein is dissolved, suspended, dispersed or otherwise mixed in a selected carrier or diluent at an effective concentration such that the treated condition is ameliorated. The pharmaceutical apolipoprotein formulations are preferably formulated for single dosage administration. Therapeutically effective doses for the parenteral delivery of human apolipoprotein are well known to the art. Where apolipoprotein analogs are used or other modes of delivery are used therapeutically effective doses may be readily empirically determined by those of skill in the art using known<br>
testing protocols or by extrapolation of in-vivo or in-vitro test data. It is understood however that concentrations and dosages may vary in accordance with the severity of the condition alleviated. It is further understood that for any particular subject, specific dosage regimens may be adjusted over time according to individual judgement of the person administering or supervising administration of the formulations.<br>
Pharmaceutical solutions or suspensions may include for example a sterile diluent such as, for example, water, lactose, sucrose, dicalcium phosphate, or carboxymethyl cellulose. Carriers that may be used include water, saline solution, aqueous dextrose, glycerol, glycols, ethanol and the like, to thereby form a solution or suspension. If desired the pharmaceutical compositions may also contain non-toxic auxiliary substances such a wetting agents; emulsifying agents; solubilizing agents; antimicrobial agents, such as benzyl alcohol and methyl parabens; antioxidants, such as ascorbic acid and sodium bisulfite; chelating agents siach as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA); pH buffering agents such as actetate, citrate or phosphate buffers; and combinations thereof.<br>
The final formulation of the apolipoprotein preparation will generally depend on the mode of apolipoprotein delivery. The apolipoprotein prepared in accordance with the present invention may be delivered in any desired manner; however parenteral, oral and nasal forms of delivery are considered the most likely used modes'of delivery. Parenteral preparations can be enclosed in ampoules, disposable syringes or single or multiple dose vials made of glass, plastic or other such suitable materials.<br>

Example 2 Agrobacterium and Ambidopsis Transformation<br>
Arabidopsis thaliana cv. Columbia (C24) is used for all the experiments. Seeds are planted on the surface of a soil mixture (two-thirds Redi-earth and one-third perlite with a pH = 6.7) or an Arabidopsis soil mixture supplied by Lehle Seeds (perlite, vermiculite, peat, terra-green, with a pH = 5.5) in 4 inch pots. The seedlings are allowed to grow to a rosette stage of 6-8 leaves to a diameter of approximately 2.5 cm. These seedlings are transplanted into 4 inch pots containing the above soil mixture, covered with window screen material which has five 1 cm diameter holes cut into the mesh; one in each of the corners, and one in the center. The pots are placed inside a dome at 4Â°C for four days for a cold treatment and subsequently moved to 24Â°C growth room with constant light at about 150 piE and 50% relative humidity. The plants are irrigated at 2-3 day interval and fertilized weekly with 1% of Peters 20-20-20. Each pot contains five plants. When plants reach about 2 cm in height, the primary bolts are cut to encourage the growth of secondary and tertiary bolts. 4 to 5 days after cutting the primary bolts, the plants are ready to be infected with Agrobacterium. The plasmid was transformed into electrocompetent Agrobacterium EHA101. The pots with Arabidopsis plants are inverted and infected with 500 ml of a re-suspension an overnight Agrobacterium culture containing the plant transformation vector of interest for 20 seconds. It is critical that the Agrobacterium culture contains 5% sucrose and 0.05% of the surfactant Silwet L-77 (Lehle Seeds). The pots are<br>
subsequently covered with a transparent plastic aome ror 2&amp; nours tu maintain higher humidity. The plants are allowed to grow to maturity and seeds (untransformed and transformed) are harvested. For selection of transgenic lines/ the putative transformed seeds are sterilized in a quick wash of 70% ethanol, then 20% commercial bleach for 15 min and then rinsed at Least four times with ddH2O. About 1000 sterilized seeds are mixed with 0.6% top a gar and evenly spread on a half strength MS plate (Murashige and Skoog, 1962, Physiologia Plantarum 15: 473-497) containing 0.5% sucrose and 80 juM of the herbicide phosphinothricin (PPT) DL. The plates are then placed in a growth room with light regime 8 hr dark and 16 hr light at 24Â°C. After 7 to 10 days, putative transgenic seedlings are green and growing whereas tmtransformed seedlings are bleached. After the establishment of roots the putative transgenic seedlings are individually transferred to pots (the individually plants are irrigated in 3 day interval and fertilized with 1% Peters 20-20-20 in 5 day interval) and allowed to grow to maturity. The pots are covered with a transparent plastic dome for three days to protect the sensitive seedlings. After 7 days the seedlings are covered with a seed collector from Lehle Seeds to prevent seed loss due to scattering. Seeds from these transgenic plants are harvested individually and ready for analysis. Total Leaf Extract Preparation<br>
An Arabidopsis leaf was frozen with liquid nitrogen and ground in a 1.5 ml microfuge tube using a drill. 200-250 ul of 0.5M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 was added and the sample put on ice. 20% SDS was added to a final concentration of 2%. The sample was boiled for 5 minutes and the extract was spun in a microfuge at maximum speed for 5 minutes. The liquid was removed to another microfuge tube and stored at -20Â°C. Soluble proteins were quantified using the BCA Protein assay (Pierce) and analyzed on a 15% SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. An anti-Apo AI or anti-GFP rabbit antiserum was used as the primary antibody; and anti-rabbit-IgG [H+L]-AP conjugate (Bio-Rad) was used as the secondary antibody. Total Seed Extract Preparation<br>
Approximately 40 Arabidopsis seeds (T2 seed) were ground in 50 uL buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.5) in microfuge tube using Stir-Pak laboratory mixer. 20% SDS was subsequently added to the sample to a final<br>

Example 4<br>
Western blot analysis for apolipoprotein localization<br>
The isolation of oil bodies was performed as previously described (van Rooijen &amp; Moloney, 1995) with the following modifications. Briefly, 250 mg of dry mature seeds were surface sterilized with 70% ethanol, rinsed twice with sterile water and once with a phosphate buffer (100 mM phosphate buffer pH 8 with 0.5M NaCl). After washing, the seeds were resuspended in phosphate buffer for analytical analysis and then ground using a sterilized mortar and pestle. After grinding, the sample was transferred to a centrifuge bottle and centrifuged for 15 rnin at 10, 000 g at RT. After centrifugation, the fat pad containing the oil bodies was removed from the aqueous phase (AQ) and transferred to a 1.5 mL microfuge tube. The oil bodies were resuspended in a low stringency phosphate buffer (100 mM phosphate buffer pH 8 with 0.5M NaCl). The sample was centrifuged for 15 minutes at 10,000 g at 4Â°C and the undertatant removed. The undernatant (PW) and phosphate washed oil bodies (PO) were tested for the presence of the apolipoprotein. The oil bodies were subsequently resuspended in a high stringency urea buffer (8M Urea in 100 mM Na-Carbonate buffer pH 8). The sample was centrifuged for 15 rniri at 10, 000 g at 4Â°C and the undernatant removed. The undernatant (UW) and urea washed oil bodies (UO) were tested for the presence of the apolipoprotein. Note that oil bodies are treated with low and high stringency washes in order to remove proteins which associate with the oil bodies. Oleosin resists high stringency washes and remains with the oil body fraction. The microsomal fraction (ER) was obtained by grinding approximately 250 mg of dry seeds in 4 mL of microsome grinding buffer (0.5M Sucrose, 0.2M Hepes-NaOH buffer, pH 7.4), into a slurry with a mortar and pestle. The slurry was centrifuged at 10,000 g for 30 min at 4Â°C. The supernatant was transferred into new tubes, and recentrifuged at 10,000 g for another 30 min at 4Â°C to completely remove oil bodies. The supernatant was then centrifuged for 2 hrs at 100,000 g at 4Â°C using an ultracentrifuge with a swinging bucket rotor. The pellet was washed<br>
with microsome grinding buffer, quickly centrifuged for 5 rnin for 10,000 g<br>
and resuspended in 10-15 uL of microsome grinding buffer and stored at -<br>
20Â°C.<br>
Untargeted constructs<br>
As seen in Figure 36A, pro- (Apoll) and mature (ApolO) Apo AI-GFP fusions, without additional targeting signals, were examined in the different fractions. ApolO shows that while the mature Apo AI-GFP fusion protein is detected in all cellular fractions, there appears to be more protein accumulation with the oil bodies washed with phosphate buffer and the urea wash fraction. This suggests that while ApolO does possess some affinity to oil bodies, a high stringency wash is sufficient to remove it from the surface of the oil bodies. Apoll shows that the presence of the native pro-sequence of Apo AI targets the Apo AI-GFP fusion protein to the oil body fraction to a greater extent than when the pro-peptide is missing, and that the protein remains bound to the oil-bodies even when high stringency washes are used. It appears that the pro-Apo AI peptide acts as an 'anchoring' sequence to maintain pro-Apo AI on the surface on the oil bodies. Multiple lower molecular weight bands can be detected in these fractions, which may be degradation products. Oil body targeted constructs<br>
This pattern of tight association of Apo AI-GFP fusion protein with oil bodies can also be seen in the oil body targeted constructs (Figure 36B). Pro- (ApolS) and mature (Apol2) Apo AI-GFP fusions are fused in-frame to the C-terminus of oleosin, which serves as a targeting signal to oil bodies. As seen previously for the untargeted pro-Apo AI-GFP fusion, the protein is predominantly associated with the phosphate and urea-washed oil body fractions. Multiple lower molecular weight bands are also detected in these fractions, indicating that there is something unique to the oil body associated fractions which leads to an accumulation of possible degradation products. Secretory system targeted constructs<br>
The PRS signal peptide (Sijmons et al., 1990, Bio/technology, 8:217-221) which targets proteins to the secretory pathway was added as an in-frame translational fusion to the pro- (Apol6) and mature (ApolS) forms of<br>
Apo AI-GFP (Figure 37). Normally, this results in the secretion of the fusion protein into the extracellular space (apoplast) of plant cells. However, when the cellular fractions of the two constructs were examined, the Apo AI-GFP fusion protein was detected in all of the fractions, with more protein being detected in the oil body fractions. A band the size of the recombinant fusion protein can also be observed in the oil body fractions when the Ponceau-S stained immunoblot is examined (Figure 37, upper panel). The presence of the native pro-sequence of Apo AI did aot appear to change the secreted fusion protein's association with a specific cellular fraction. The plant presequence recognition signal (PRS) pep tide appears to interfere with the 'anchoring' characteristic of the pro-Apo AI peptide. Constitutive expression of Apo AI-GFP in the leaves<br>
Leaf tissue that constitutively expressed the untargeted and secreted pro- and mature forms of Apo AI-GFP was examined to determine if the Apo AI-GFP fusion protein could accumulate in non-oil producing tissues. Leaf tissues were homogenized (as described in example 2) from the transgenic plants lines constitutively expressing the untargeted pro- (ApolB) and mature (Apol7) and the secreted pro- (Apo20) and mature (Apol9) forms of Apo AI-GFP and used for immunoblotting. Leaf material was also sampled from wild-type (c24) plants for a negative control, and from UR2 (ubiquitin-driven oleosin-GFP) plants and UG-14 (ubiquitin-driven GFP) plants for positive controls for leaf expression. Similar amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and the Apo AI-GFP fusion protein was detected by immunoblotting with an anti-GFP antibody (Figure 38 lower panel).<br>
Faint bands were detected in the non-transformed line, whereas the both the ubiquitin-driven GFP (UG-14) and oleosin-GFP (UR2) fusion are readily detected on the immunoblot by the anti-GFP antibody. However, while a similar amount of leaf protein was loaded on the immunoblot as can be seen by Ponceau-S staining of the merobrane (upper panel, Figure 38), no bands can be detected for any of the Apo AI-GFP fusion protein constructs. The faint band detected in the background of the immunoblot may be due to cross-reactivity with Rubisco, the most prevalent protein found in leaf tissue (Spreitzer RJ &amp; Salvucci ME (2002) Rubisco: structure, regulatory interactions,<br>
and possibilities for a better enzyme. Annu Rev Plant Biol 53:449-475.), which can be seen in the Ponceau-S stained panel of the immunoblot by size (55 kDa) according to the molecular weight markers. Seed specific expression of untargeted and secreted Apo AI in seeds<br>
One transgenic line was selected from each of the T2 generation Apo AI transgenic plants that showed some accumulation of either pro- or mature ApoAI protein in total seed extracts. Of the plant lines that were putative transgenics, only 1 line for the following showed any protein expression: Apo21 (untargeted mature Apo AI), Apo22 (untargeted pro-Apo AI), and Apo29 (secreted mature Apo AI); two lines were found for ApoSO (secreted pro-Apo AI). All transgenic plant lines that contained the constructs Apo23 and Apo24 appeared to express and accumulate the oleosin-Apo AI fusion protein. Similar amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and the Apo AI protein was detected by immunoblotting with an anti-Apo AI antibody (Figure 39). A negative control was included for the immunoblot by preparing a similar protein extract from a non-transformed plant (c24). The correct size of band for Apo AI expressed alone (expected molecular weight of 28.3 kDa for mature Apo AI and 29.3 kDa for pro-Apo AI) was only observed in line Apo22-3 (untargeted pro-Apo AI). The predominant band detected in Apo21-ll (untargeted mature Apo AI) is the incorrect size, and while only minor bands are detected in Apo29-ll (secreted mature Apo AI) and Apo30-14 (secreted proApo AI) none are the correct size. However, for both of the oleosin fusions, Apo23-ll (oleosin-mature Apo AI) and Apo24-6 (oleosin-pro-Apo AI), a significant amount of Apo AI fusion protein is detected by anti-Apo AI antibody and can also be detected in the Ponceau-S stained immunoblot (upper panel). Subcellular localization of untargeted Apo AI (Apo22) T3 seeds<br>
The seed-specific expression of the pro-form of the untargeted Apo AI protein (Apo22) and its association with a specific cellular fraction was examined in mature seeds (Figure 40). Seeds were homogenized and treated as described above, and the cellular fractions were subjected to immunoblotting with an antibody against Apo AI. Apo22-3 shows that the presence of the native pro-sequence of Apo AI targets the Apo AI protein to the oil body fraction, and that the protein requires high stringency washes to<br>
remove the protein from the oil bodies. Some protein can also be detected in the aqueous phase indicating that not all the pro-Apo AI protein is associated with the oil bodies. Multiple lower molecular weight bands can be detected in these fractions, which maybe degradation products.<br>
Example 5<br>
Confocal microscopy for apolipoprotein localization<br>
Immature embryos were dissected out of Apo AI-GFP siliques under sterile water into a Petri dish using forceps and a dissecting microscope. Embryos were removed from the seed coat by gentle pressure on the immature seeds with a glass microscope slide cover. Embryos were transferred by pipette into a 1.5 mL microfuge tube with water added to a final volume of 1 mL. Nile Red (Molecular Probes) was used at a final concentration of 1 Mg//iL. Embryos in diluted Nile Red were left to incubate for 15 min in darkness at room temperature. Embryos were rinsed 3 times in sterile water and mounted in water on glass slides for microscopy. Leaf epidermal cells were prepared by simply cutting small portions of leaves (0.5cm2) with a scalpel and mounting them in water on microscope slides with cover slips. The leaf sections were placed so that the lower epidermis faced upwards (less interference with autofluorescent chloroplasts).<br>
All GFP-dependent fluorescence was analyzed from Arabidopsis embryos and leaf epidermal cells mounted in water for microscopic observations and examined with a Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope (Edmonton, AB). For simultaneous detection of GFP and Nile Red a line-sequential single-tracking mode with the AOTF-controlled excitation with 488 nm and 543 nm light was set at 20% and 100% respectively. A Plan-Appochromat 63x/1.4 Oil DIG objective was used with a 5X scan zoom. The pinhole was optimized for Channel 2 (green) at 94 jam and for Channel 1 (red) at 106 nm.<br>
The resulting micrographs can be seen in Figures 42 to 45. Colocalization (indicated in yellow) between untargeted pro-Apo AI-GFP fusions (Apoll) and Nile red stained oil bodies, is evident in Figure 41 (D-F). There is also colocalization (indicated in yellow) between Apol2, mature Apo AI fused to GFP targeted to oil bodies using oleosin, (G-I of Figure 41) and<br>
ApolS, pro-Apo AJ fused to GPP targeted to oil bodies using oleosin (A-C of Figure 42). Colocalization (indicated in yellow) between untargeted pro-Apo AI-GFP fusions (ApolS) and Nile red stained oil bodies is evident in (D-F of Figure 43). No colocalization between Apo AI-GFP fusion protein (Apol9) and oil bodies is observed (G-H of Figure 43). In Figure 44, no colocalization is evident in the leaves. In conclusion, in the absence of an oil body target (i.e. oleosin), co-localization of Apo AI is observed, only in the embryos (in the presence of neutral lipid) and only when the pro-peptide of Apo AI is expressed in the cytoplasm (i.e. not when secreted).<br>
Example 6<br>
Cleavage and HPLC analysis of Apo 25, 26 and 28 expressing Arabidopsis<br>
Seed<br>
Cleavage of Apo25, Apo26 and Apo28 recombinant protein<br>
The isolation of oil bodies was performed as previously described (van Rooijen &amp; Moloney, 1995) with the following modifications. Briefly, 250 mg of dry mature seeds were surface sterilized with 70% ethanol, rinsed twice with sterile water and once with a phosphate buffer (100 mM phosphate buffer pH 8 with 0.5M NaCl). After washing, the seeds were resuspended in phosphate buffer for analytical analysis and then ground using a sterilized mortar and pestle. After grinding, the sample was transferred to a centrifuge bottle and centrifuged for 15 min at 10,000 g at RT. After centrifugation, the fat pad containing the oil bodies was transferred to a 1.5 mL microfuge tube and resuspended in a urea buffer (8M Urea in 100 mM Na-Carbonate buffer pH 8). The sample was centrifuged for 15 min at 10, 000 g at 4Â°C and the undernatant removed. The fat pad was resuspended in sterile ddH2O, centrifuged for 15 min at 10, 000 g at 4Â°C and the undernatant removed. The oil bodies were resuspended in 50 /iL of sterile ddH2O and stored in the dark at 4Â°C. The cleavage reaction was performed in a 20 /iL reaction volume containing 100 mM phosphate buffer pH 4.5, with a final ratio of 1:100 protease to oil body protein, at 37Â°C for 2 hrs. A sample reaction would be as follows: 20 jig of purified Apo25, Apo26 or Apo28 was combined with 2 /iL 1M phosphate buffer pH 4.5 (final concentration lOOmM), 2 jxL chymosin (0.1 _g/_l) with sterile ddH2O to bring up to final volume of 20 fjL.<br>
After 2 hrs, the cleavage reaction was centrifuged for 15 min, and the undernatent was removed from the fat pad and each phase was analyzed for recombinant protein. Purification of Apo25, Apo26 and Apo28 by reverse phase chromatography<br>
Approximately, 1000 /ig of Apo25, Apo26 or Apo28 was cleaved by chymosin for 2 hrs at 37Â°C. After the cleavage reaction was completed, the reaction was centrifuged for 15 min at 10, 000 g at 4Â°C and the undernatent was recovered. The fat pad was resupsended in a urea buffer (8M Urea in 0.1 mM Na-Carbonate buffer pH 8), and recentrifuged for 15 min. The undernatent or wash was recovered, and the washes were repeated for an additional three times, with the undernatent being recovered each time and pooled into a 15 mL Falcon tube. After the urea washes were completed, the washes were aliquoted into 1.5 mL microfuge tubes, and centrifuged for 15 minutes to remove any contaminating oil body residue. The undernatents were recovered and filtered into a new 15 mL Falcon tube using a 0.2 micron filter. A VYDAC 214TP54 C4 silica 5 micron (Grace Vydac, Anaheim, CA) reverse-phase chromatography column (0.24 X 25 cm) was equilibrated in buffer A (10% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) at a flow-rate of 2 rnL/min. The pooled chymosin-cleaved Apo25, Apo26 or Apo28 urea undernatent was loaded on the column. A linear gradient was applied to the column 0 to 60% buffer B (95% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) for the elution of Apo AI. Apo AI (US Biological, Catalogue number A2299-10) was used as a standard for comparising the cleavage products from Apo25, Apo26 and Apo28. Fractions 19.6' to 20.8' (0.2' = 0.4 mL each) were collected. Comparing the relative intensities of the DAD traces at 214,254,280 &amp; 326 run indicates that the material eluting in the 19.5-21.0' zone most likely represents the Apo AI polypeptide (Figure 45A). These peaks also increased in intensity compared to a previous injection of 0.020 mL of the same sample. To purify the cleavage product from Apo25 (oleosin-klip8-Apo AI(met+)), chymosin treated fractions were collected from 7 to 25' @ 1 mL each. The major polypeptide peak is at 20.5' (Figure 45B), -which is just 0.2' later than the suspected hApo AI standard. To purify the cleavage product from Apo26 (oleosin-klip8-pro-Apo AI(met+)), fractions were collected from 7 to 25' at 1 mL each. The major polypeptide peak is at 18' (Figure 45C), which is 2.4'<br>
earlier than the suspected hApo AI standard. To purify the cleavage product from Apo28 (oleosin-klip8-pro-Apo AI), fractions were collected from 7 to 25' at 1 mL each. The major polypeptide peak is at 18' (Figure 45D), which is 2.4' earlier than the suspected hApo AI standard but similar to the Apo26 run.<br>
Mass spectrometry<br>
Mass spectra were acquired by Doug Olson (National Research Council of Canada, Plant Biotechnology Institute BioAnalytical Spectroscopy Group, Saskatoon, SK) on an Applied Biosystems Voyager-DE STR matrix assisted laser desorption ionisation time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometer instrument (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Samples were spotted onto a OPI-TOF LC MALDI insert (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using a matrix of sinapinic acid saturated in 30% acetonitrile/70% water/0.1% TFA. Ions were accelerated at +20 kV and masses were detected in linear mode, with horse heart myoglobin used as an external calibrant. -Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry of the purified recombinant mature Apo25 protein gave a molecular mass of 28, 325 Da, which is 6 Da greater than calculated molecular weight of 28, 319 Da. The difference in value from the observed value from the expected, may be due to a case of limited sample leading to a decreased signal to noise ratio and a decreased accuracy. The expected molecular weight of mature Apo AI is 28,187 Da, but due to the presence of the additional Met residue, the cleaved recombinant mature Apo AI protein has an increased molecular weight. The purified standard hApo AI protein was also analyzed by mass spectrometry, and it possessed two distinct peaks at 25, 969 Da and 22, 815 Da. Both of these observed values are significantly lower than the expected value of 28,187 Da; however, these two predominant lower molecular weights were previously observed on the immunoblots. It is likely that it is this decrease in molecular weight that results in the slightly different elution profile of the human and recombinant proteins as was seen by RP-HPLC.<br>
Example 7<br>
Transformation of safflower<br>
This transformation protocol is similar to that outlined by Orlilcowska T. K. et al. ((1995) Plant Cell, Tissue and Organ Culture 40: 85-91),<br>
but with modifications and improvements both for transforming S-317 and for using phosphinothricin as the selectable marker. Decontaminate seeds from S-317 California variety of safflower, which are not damaged, cracked or diseased, in 0.1% HC12 for 12 minutes followed by 4-5 rinses with sterile distilled water. Germinate sterile seeds in the dark on MS medium (Murashige T. &amp; Skoog F (1962) Physiol. Plant. 15: 473-497) with 1% sucrose and 0.25% Gelrite. Initiate Agrobacterium cultures from frozen glycerol stocks in 5 ml AB minimal liquid media with antibiotic selection, and grow for 48 hours at 28Â° C. Grow an aliquot of this culture grown overnight in 5 ml of Luria broth with selection for transformation. Wash 6-8 ml of bacterial cells twice with AB media, and make up to a final cell density of 0.4 -0.5 (OD600).<br>
Remove two-day-old cotyledons from germinated seedlings, dip in the prepared Agrobacterium cells, and plate on MS medium with 3% sucrose, 4 nM N6-benzyladenine (BA) and 0.8 nM naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA). Incubate plates at 21Â° C under dark conditions. After 3 days, transfer to the same medium with 300 mg/L timentin. After an additional 4 days, move all cultures to the light. After 3 days, place explants on selection medium with phosphinothricin added at 0.5 mg/L. For continued bud elongation, transfer explants weekly onto MS medium without phytohormones but with twice the basal amount of KNO3. Excise shoots that had elongated to greater than 10 mm from the initial explant and individually grow on selection. For rooting, place green shoots, representing putative transgenic tissue, on MS medium with 2% sucrose, 10 \iM indolebutyric acid and 0.5 jiM NAA. Transfer rooted shoots to a well drained soil-less mix and grow under high humidity and 12 hours of light.<br>
Example 8<br>
Flax transformation protocol<br>
This transformation procedure is similar to that outlined by Dong J. and McHughen A. (Plant Cell Reports (1991) 10:555-560), Dong J. and McHughen A. (Plant Sciences (1993) 88:61-71) and Mlynarova et al. (Plant Cell Reports (1994) 13: 282-285). Decontaminate flax seeds, which are not damaged, cracked or diseased, in a 70% ethanol solution for 5 to 7 minutes, followed by 25 minutes in a 50% bleach solution with Tween 20 (3-4 drops per<br>
100ml) with continuous stirring. Rinse seeds 5 to 7 times with sterile distilled water. Germinate decontaminated seeds in the light on MS medium (Murashige T. &amp; Skoog F (1962) Physiol. Plant. 15: 473-497) with 2% sucrose and 0.3% GelriteÂ® in Magenta jars. For transformation, grow Agrobacterium cultures overnight in AB broth plus the appropriate antibiotic for selection. Wash 6 to 8 ml of overnight cells twice, and re-suspended in 5 rnl of AB broth; add 2 ml of this stock to 98 ml of induction medium (MS basal medium with 3% sucrose, 5 nM 6-benzylaminopurine (BA) and 0.25 (xM alpha-naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) and adjust for a final OD600 of 1.0.<br>
Section hypocotyl explants, and inoculate in the prepared Agrobacterium cell solution for about 4 h (stir plates gently 1-2 times during this period). After the infection period, remove explants from the liquid inoculation medium and blot on sterile filter paper. Plate 15-20 explants on 0.7% agar-solidified induction medium in tissue culture plates. Seal the plates with plastic wrap, and co-cultivate explants for 48 h under light conditions (23-24 Â°C). After 2 days, transfer the green, meristematic explants to the same medium containing 300 mg/L Timentin (pre-selection media) and wrap with plastic wrap. After 3 days, transfer the cultures to the above medium containing 10 mg/L DL PPT (Selection 1). Wrap the plates with ParafilmÂ® and incubate at 24 Â°C under light conditions. Transfer cultures every two weeks and keep on this media for one month. For shoot elongation, transfer the cultures every two weeks on selection medium II (MS .basal medium, containing 2% sucrose, 500mg/L MES buffer, 300 mg/L Timentin and 10 mg/L DL PPT) in Magenta jars. Putative transformed shoots, which survived selection, are dark green and form vigorous roots in 7-10 days when planted individually on selection II media. Transfer rooted shoots to sterilized greenhouse soil mix in small pots and cover plantlets with clear plastic cups for acclimatization. For maturation, transfer actively growing plants to one-gallon pots with a well-drained soil mix and grow under greenhouse conditions.<br>
