Tachykinins are a family of peptides that share a common carboxyl-terminal sequence (Phe-X-Gly-Leu-Met-NH2). They are actively involved in the physiology of both lower and advanced lifeforms. In mammalian lifefonns, the main tachykinins are substance P (SP), Neurokinin A (NKA) and Neurokinin B (NKB) which act as neurotransmitters and neuromodulators. Mammalian tachykinins may contribute to the pathophysiology of a number of human diseases.<br>
Three types of tachykinins receptors have been identified, namely NKl(SP-preferring), NK2 (NKA-preferring) and NK3 (NKB-preferring) which are widely distributed throughout the central nervous (CNS) and peripheral nervous system.<br>
Particularly, the compounds of the invention are antagonists of the NK1 receptor.<br>
By virtue of their efficacy as tachykinins receptor (expecially NK1 receptor) antagonists, the compounds of the present invention are particularly useful for the treatment of QMS disorders and psychotic disorders, in particular in the treatment or prevention of depressive states and /or in the treatment of anxiety.<br>
NKj-receptor binding affinity has been determined in vitro by measuring the compounds' ability to displace [3HJ - substance f (SP) from recombmant human NKj receptor expressed in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell membranes and from gerbil and marmoset brain cortex homogenates.<br>
Membrane preparation from hNKl-CHO cells were performed essentially as described by Beattie et al. (Br. J. Pharmacol, 116:3149-3157,1995).<br>
hNKl-CHO cells were harvested in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing SmM EDTA and centrifuged at 913g for 8 min at 4°C. Cells were men re-suspended in 10 volumes of membrane-preparation buffer (HEPES SOmM, pH 7.4, containing O.lmM leupeptin, 40ug/ml bacftracin, ImM EDTA, IraM Pefabloc and 2uM pepstatin A) and homogenised. The suspension was centrifuged at 48,000g for 20 minutes at 4°C. The final pellet was re-suspended in 10 volumes of membrane preparation buffer and re-homogenised. Suspensions of membrane were then frozen at -80°C until required.<br>
The assay volume of 200 ul consisted of 2ul of DMSO or increasing concentrations of test compound dissolved in DMSO (IpM-luM final concentration), lOOul of [3HJ-SP (O.SnM final concentration), and lOOul of membrane suspension (8 ug of protein per well) in incubation buffer (containing SOmM HEPES, pH 7.4, 3mM MnC12, and 0.02% BSA). The incubation was carried out at room temperature for 40min. Non-specific binding was defined by the addition of cold SP (luM). The reaction was stopped by rapid filtration. Filters were washed 5 times with 200ul of ice-cold 0.9% w/v NaCl, and radioactivity was counted in a<br>
microplate scintillation counter. In each experiment, every concentration of displacer was tested in duplicate.<br>
Mongolian gerbil (60g, Charles River) and common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus, 300-400g,<br>
GSK colony, Verona, Italy) brain cortex homogenates were prepared as follows: fresh tissues<br>
were weighed, crumbled and homogenised in 10 volumes of membrane-preparation buffer.<br>
The homogenate was then centrifuged at 48,000g for 20 minutes, and the pellet was washed<br>
once more by ^suspension in 10 volumes of membrane preparation buffer and centrifugation<br>
at 48,000g for 20 minutes. The final pellet was re-suspended in 7-10 volumes of membrane<br>
preparation buffer and subdivided in aliquots frozen at -80°C until use.<br>
The assay volume of 400 ul consisted of lOOul of incubation buffer (containing 50mM<br>
HEPES, pH 7.4, 3mM MnC12, and 0.02% BSA), 4ul of DMSO or increasing concentrations<br>
of test compound dissolved in DMSO (1 pM-luM final concentration), lOOul of [3H]-SP<br>
(O.SnM-0.8nM final concentration) in incubation buffer and 200ul of membrane suspension<br>
(0.6 mg protein for gerbil, and 0.8 mg protein for marmoset) in incubation buffer containing<br>
2 ug/ml ieupeptin, 20 fig/ml bachracin and O.SuM phosphoramidon. The incubation<br>
proceeded at room temperature for 60 min. Non-specific binding was defined by the addition<br>
of cold SP (luM). The reaction was stopped by rapid filtration. Filters were washed 3 tunes<br>
with 1ml ice cold wash buffer (containing SOmM HEPES, pH 7.4, and 3mM MnC12), and<br>
radioactivity was counted in a liquid scintillation counter.	&gt;<br>
The potency of test compounds to inhibit SP or GR73632-induced increase of [Ca2+]i in KNK1/CHO cells was determined in functional experiments by using FLEPR (fluorimetric imaging plate reader) technology.<br>
hNKl/CHO cells were seeded at a density of 60,000 cells per well and cultured overnight in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated foetal bovine serum and 2 mM glutamine. The cells were then incubated for the labelling in the culture medium containing the fluorescent calcium indicator Fluo-4 AM (2uM), the organic anions transport blocker probenecid (5mM), and HEPES (20mM) for 30 min hi a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. After washing with Hanks' Balanced Salts Solution (HBSS) containing 20mM HEPES and 2.5mM probenecid, the cells were incubated for 60min at 37C in wash buffer containing 0.02%BSA either in the absence (control) or in the presence of test compounds. The plates were men placed into a FLIPR to monitor cell fluorescence (cx-488 nm, em™510-570 nm) before and after the addition of different concentrations of SP or GR73632«in assay buffer. Experiments were carried out by using a laser setting of 1.0 W and a 0.4 sec charge coupled device (CCD) camera shutter speed.<br>
Compounds of the invention have also been found to exhibit anxiolytic activity in conventional tests. For example in marmoset human threat test (Costall et al., 1988).<br>
The action of the compounds of the invention at the NKj receptor may be determined by using conventional tests. Thus, the ability to penetrate the central nervous system and to bind<br>
at the NKj receptor was demonstrated in vivo by their inhibitory effect on the change in the behaviour induced by intracerebroventricular applied substance P in the gerbil, according to the gerbil foot tapping model as described by Rupniak &amp; Williams, Eur. J. of Phannacol., 265,179-183, 1994.<br>
Compounds of the invention are useful in the treatment of CNS disorders and psychotic disorders, in particular in the treatment or prevention of depressive states and /or hi the treatment of anxiety as defined in, but not restricted to, Diagnostic Statistical of Mental Disorder (DSM) IV edition edit by American Psychiatric Association and International Classification Diseases 10th revision (ICD10).<br>
Thus, for example, depressive states include Major Depressive Disorders (MDD), including bipolar depression, unipolar depression, single or recurrent major depressive episodes , recurrent brief depression, with or without psychotic features, catatonic features, melancholic features including anorexia, weight loss, atypical features, anxious depression, cyclothymic or postpartum onset.<br>

The compounds of formula (I) may readily be isolated in association with solvent molecules by crystallisation from or evaporation of an appropriate solvent to give the corresponding solvates.<br>
When a specific enantiomer of a compound of general formula (I) is required, this may be obtained for example by resolution of a corresponding enantiomeric mixture of a compound of formula CD using conventional methods.<br>
Thus, for example, specific enantiomers of the compounds of formula (I) may be obtained from the corresponding enantiomeric mixture of a compound of formula (I) usin&amp; chiral HPLC procedure.<br>
Alternatively, enantiomers of a compound of general formula (I) may be synthesised from the appropriate optically active intermediates (ffl), (IV), (V),(VD), (VIQ) and (DC) using any of the general processes described herein.<br>
