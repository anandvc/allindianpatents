CLOCK AND ANCHOR PIPE FITTING AND METHOD<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] 	The present invention relates to a pipe fitting for an intake manifold of an<br>
internal combustion engine.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] 	Pipe fittings are typically held within an intake manifold by a "clock and<br>
lock" mounting strategy. Such a strategy typically employs snap fit features on the pipe<br>
fitting and/or the intake manifold, such that the pipe fitting is inserted into the manifold<br>
and rotated or "clocked" against the bias force of a retaining feature into engagement<br>
with the locking feature, thereby locking the pipe fitting with respect to the intake<br>
manifold.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003]	A pipe fitting assembly is provided for a component, such as an intake<br>
manifold of an internal combustion engine, defining a generally cylindrical bore and<br>
having at least one tab portion defining at least one groove. The pipe fitting assembly<br>
includes a fitting member having a generally cylindrical portion configured for insertion<br>
into the generally cylindrical bore such that the fitting member is rotatable between a<br>
first and second position. At least one flange is formed on the fitting member and is<br>
operable to engage the at least one groove when the fitting member is rotated from the<br>
first position to the second position, thereby preventing the removal of the generally<br>
cylindrical portion from the generally cylindrical bore. A tube member is also provided<br>
having a first end mounted with respect to the fitting member and a second end<br>
mounted with respect to the component. The tube member is operable to retain the<br>
fitting member in the second position.<br>
[0004]	The above features and advantages and other features and advantages of<br>
the present invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description of the<br><br>
GP-309348-PTE-JEK<br>
2<br>
best modes for carrying out the invention when taken in connection with the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0005]	Figure 1 is a partially exploded view of an intake manifold and a pipe<br>
fitting assembly mountable thereto;<br>
[0006]	Figure 2 is a schematic top view of a portion of the intake manifold and a<br>
pipe fitting of the pipe fitting assembly of Figure 1, illustrating the pipe fitting in a first<br>
position; and<br>
[0007]	Figure 3 is a schematic top view of a portion of the intake manifold and<br>
the pipe fitting of Figure 2, illustrating the pipe fitting in a second position.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0008]	Referring to the drawings wherein like reference numbers correspond to<br>
like or similar components throughout the several views, there is shown in Figure 1 a<br>
component, such as an intake manifold assembly 10 for an internal combustion engine,<br>
not shown. The intake manifold assembly 10 includes an intake manifold 12 and a pipe<br>
fitting assembly 14 mountable thereto (shown separated from the intake manifold 12 in<br>
Figure 1). The intake manifold 10 includes a plenum 16 in communication with a<br>
plurality of intake runners 18. The plenum 16 and intake runners 18 cooperate to convey<br>
intake air to the internal combustion engine. The intake manifold 12 of Figure 1 is<br>
formed from plastic; however, the intake manifold 12 may be formed from cast metal,<br>
such as aluminum, magnesium, etc. while remaining within the scope of that which is<br>
claimed. The intake manifold 12 defines a generally cylindrical bore 20 that extends into<br>
the plenum 16. A first and second tab 22 and 24, respectively, extend from the intake<br>
manifold 12 and are provided adjacent to the generally cylindrical bore 20. The first tab<br>
22 defines a first groove 26. shown in Figures 2 and 3, while the second tab 24 defines a<br>
second groove 28, also shown in Figures 2 and 3.<br>
[0009]	The pipe fitting assembly 14 includes a pipe fitting 30 and a quick-connect<br>
fitting 32. A tube 34 includes a first end portion 36. mounted to the pipe fitting 30. and a<br><br>
GP-309348-PTE-JEK<br>
3<br>
second end portion 38, mounted to the quick-connect fitting 32. The tube 34 is<br>
preferably formed from a semi-flexible plastic material to allow proper positioning of the<br>
quick-connect fitting 32. The pipe fitting 30 includes a generally cylindrical portion 40<br>
sufficiently configured for insertion into the generally cylindrical bore 20. first and<br>
second flanges 42 and 44, respectively, are formed on the pipe fitting 30 and cooperate<br>
with the first and second grooves 26 and 28 of Figures 2 and 3 to retain the generally<br>
cylindrical portion 40 of the pipe fitting 30 within the generally cylindrical bore 20 as<br>
discussed in greater detail hereinbelow with reference to Figures 2 and 3. A seal 46. such<br>
as an o-ring seal, is provided on the generally cylindrical portion 40 of the pipe fitting<br>
and is operable to sealingly engage the generally cylindrical bore 20. The quick-connect<br>
fitting 32 is operable to engage a fitting 48, thereby mounting or fixing the second end<br>
portion 38 of the tube 34 with respect to the intake manifold 12. Those skilled in the art<br>
will recognize that the quick-connect fitting may be configured to mount the second end<br>
portion 38 of the tube 34 to another component, in lieu of the intake manifold 12, such as<br>
an evaporative emission purge valve, not shown.<br>
[0010]	As shown in Figure 1, the pipe fitting assembly 14 forms a portion of an<br>
evaporative emission control system. As such, the tube 34 is configured to convey<br>
evaporative emission gases, indicated as arrows 50. from the quick-connect fitting 32 to<br>
the pipe fitting 30 for subsequent introduction to the plenum 16 of the intake manifold 12.<br>
[0011]	Referring to Figures 2 and 3. there is shown a top view of a portion of the<br>
intake manifold 12 having the pipe fitting 30 mounted thereto. Figure 2 illustrates the<br>
pipe fitting 30 in a first position. In the first position, the pipe fitting 30 may be readily<br>
removed or separated from the intake manifold 12 through axial displacement. By<br>
clocking or rotating the pipe fitting 30 in the counter-clockwise direction, as indicated by<br>
arrows 52, the pipe fitting is moved from the first position to a second position, as shown<br>
in Figure 3. With the pipe fitting 30 in the second position, the first and second flanges<br>
42 and 44 engage a respective first and second groove 26 and 28. The rotation of the<br>
pipe fitting 30 into the second position is limited by stops 54 and 56 operable to engage a<br>
respective first and second flange 42 and 44. With the first flange 42 in engagement with<br>
the first groove 26 and the second flange 44 in engagement with the second groove 28.<br><br>
GP-309348-PTK-JEK<br>
4<br>
axial movement of the pipe fitting 30 with respect to the intake manifold 12 is<br>
substantially prevented. Additionally, in the case of over-pressurization of the intake<br>
manifold 12, such as by backfire, the first and second tabs 22 and 24 are operable to<br>
retain the pipe fitting 30 with respect to the intake manifold 12. The first and second tabs<br>
22 and 24, as well as the first and second flanges 42 and 44 may be characterized as<br>
lacking a locking feature operable to prevent the rotation of the pipe fitting 30 from the<br>
second position to the first position.<br>
[0012]	Referring to Figures 1 through 3, to assemble or mount the pipe fitting<br>
assembly 14 with respect to the intake manifold 12, the generally cylindrical portion 40<br>
of the pipe fitting 30 is inserted into the generally cylindrical bore 20 of the intake<br>
manifold. The pipe fitting 30 is then clocked or rotated from the first position, shown in<br>
Figure 2 to the second position shown in Figure 3. In doing so, axial displacement of the<br>
pipe fitting 30 with respect to the intake manifold is prevented. Subsequently, the quick-<br>
connect fitting 32 is mounted or attached to the intake manifold 12 via the fitting 48. By<br>
fixing or anchoring the second end portion 38 of the tube 34 with respect to the intake<br>
manifold 12, the tube 34 substantially prevents the rotation of the pipe fitting 30 with<br>
respect to the intake manifold 12, thereby maintaining the pipe fitting 30 in the second<br>
position.<br>
[0013]	The "clock and anchor" mounting nature of the pipe fitting assembly 14<br>
provides benefits over traditional 'clock and lock" mounting strategies since the simpler<br>
design contains no "lock", "retain", and "unlock" features. Therefore, the pipe fitting<br>
assembly is easier to install since there is no "retain" force to overcome to engage the<br>
"lock" function during assembly.<br>
[0014]	While the best modes for carrying out the invention have been described<br>
in detail, those familiar with the art to which this invention relates will recognize various<br>
alternative designs and embodiments for practicing the invention within the scope of the<br>
appended claims.<br><br>
