Supported chromium catalyst and its use for preparing homopoiymers and copolymers of ethylene<br>
The present invention relates to novel supported, titanized chromium catalysts for the homopoly-merization of ethylene and the copolymerizanon of ethylene with a-oiefins, a process for preparing them and their use for the polymerization of olefins.<br>
Ethylene homopoiymers and copolymers of ethylene with higher a-oiefins such as 1-butene. 1-pentene, 1-hexene or 1-octene can be prepared, for example, by polymerization using supported titanium compouncs. known as Ziegier-Natta catalysts, or else using supported chromium compounds, known as Phillips catalysts. When the homopoiymers and copolymers of ethylene are used, for example, for biown film extrusion, it is important that the polymers have a good balance between mechanical properties and processability.<br>
It is known that supported chromium catalysts are very suitable for producing ethylene copolymers having good mechanical properties. The properties of the polymers obtained in the polymerization are dependent on the way in which the chromium catalyst used has been prepared, in particular on the type of support material, e.g. its chemical structure, composition, surface area or pore volume, the type of chromium compound used, the presence of further compounds, e.g. titanium compounds, aluminum alkyls or carbon monoxide, the order in which the various components are applied or the manner of calcination and activation. It is a combination of the starting materials used together with the procedure for application to a support which then gives the desired chromium catalyst for the preparation of polymers having the property profile required for the specific application.<br>
The supported chromium catalysts are often titanized, i.e. they comprise not only the chromium compound but also variable proportions of a titanium compound by means of which the molar mass distribution and the HLM! (high load melt index), for example, can be influenced. The application of the titanium compound to the support is usually carried out during the preparation of the hydrogel, giving an Si02-Ti02 cogel. In this, the titanium dioxide is uniformly distributed throughout the support material. A disadvantage is that only a fraction of the total titanium oxide is available for polymerization at the pore surface of the catalyst. For this reason, numerous embodiments of titanized chromium catalysts in which the titanium compound is applied in a targeted manner to the pore surface, usually in a step separate from the doping of the chromium compound, have been developed.<br>
Thus, for example, EP-A-882740 describes a process for preparing a supported chromium catalyst, in which the support material has a specific surface area of from 450 to 500 m2/g and the chromium component is applied to the support first and the titanium compound is applied subsequently, with ;he titanization being carried out at temperatures of at least 300°C.<br><br>
EP-A-882741 teaches that poiyethylenes having favourable ultimate tensile strengtns are obtained when using a supported chromium catalyst whose support material has a specific surface area of at least 400 m2/g and has been dehydrated before use and in the preparation of which the chromium component is applied to the support first and the titanium compound is acoiied subsequently.<br>
The application of a mixture of a chromium compound and a titanium compound in an aprotic solvent to a support under aprotic conditions is described in JP 54141893 and JP 57049605.<br>
However the preparation and handling of organometallic compounds under aprotic conditions is complicated and costly, since the solvents have to be dried before use. In acdition: only few chromium compounds are soluble in aprotic media. An increase in the solubility of cnromium compounds in aprotic solvents can often oniy be achieved by means of a complicated synthesis.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a novel, less complicated process for preparing supported, titanized chromium catalysts.<br>
We have found that this object is achieved by a process for preparing supported, titanized chromium catalysts, which comprises the following steps:<br>
A)	bringing a support material into contact with a protic medium comprising a titanium compound and a chromium compound,<br>
B)	optionally removing the solvent,<br>
C)	optionally calcining the precatalyst obtained after step B) and<br>
D)	optionally activating the precatalyst obtained after step B) or C) in an oxygen-containing atmosphere at from 400°C to 1100°C.<br>
The invention further provides novel supported, titanized chromium catalysts which are suitable for the polymerization of ethylene and, if desired, further comonomers and are obtainable by the process of the present invention. This novel supported, titanized chromium catalyst for the ho-mopolymerization of ethylene and the copoiymerization of ethylene with a-c.efins will in the interests of brevity hereinafter be referred to as "chromium catalyst of the present rnvention".<br>
The invention also provides a process for preparing homopolymers of ethy ene and copolymers of ethylene with ct-olefins by polymerization of ethylene or mixtures of ethylene and a-olefins using at least one chromium catalyst according to :ne present invention, the horrcoolymers and copolymers of ethylene obtainable therefrom and their use for producing films<br><br>
Accordingly. ,t has now been found that homopolymers and especially copolymers of ethylene are obtained in particularly good yields when using the chromium catalysts of the present invention. The film prccucts oc:ained therefrom also have a very high puncture resistance.<br>
In view of the onor a*, it was not to be expected that this novel process would ma;<e it possidle to obtain a very active catalyst which leads ethylene polymers when blown :o produce films display oarticu arly good mechanical properties.></e>
One constituent of me chromium catalyst of the present invention is the support material, in particular an incganic solid, which is usually porous. Preference is given to oxidic support materials which may s:u\ contain hydroxy groups. The inorganic metal oxide can be spherical or granular. Examples c" such sciids, which are known to those skilled in the art, are aluminum oxide, silicon dioxide (silica gel), titanium dioxide and their mixed oxides or cogels, and aluminum phosphate. Further suitaoie support materials can be obtained by modification of the pore surface, e.g. by means of compounds of the elements boron (BE-A-861,275), aluminum (US 4,284,527), silicon (EP-A-0 16c '57) or phosphorus (DE-A 36 35 715). Preference is given to using a silica gel. Preference is given to spnerical or granular silica gels, which in the case of the former may be spray dried.<br>
Preferred support materials are finely divided silica xerogels which can be prepared, for example, as describee n DE-A 25 40 279. The finely divided silica xerogels are preferably prepared by:<br>
a)	use z: a particulate silica hydrogel which has a solids content of from 10 to 25% by weight<br>
(calculated as Si02) and is largely spherical, has a particle diameter of from 1 to 8 mm<br>
and 's obtained by<br>
a1)     introducing a sodium or potassium water glass solution into a swirling stream of an aqueous mineral acid, both longitudinally and tangentially to the main direction of flow, a2)     spraying the resulting silica hydrosol into a gaseous medium so as to form droplets, a3)     allowing the sprayed hydrosol to solidify in the gaseous medium, a4)     freeing the resulting largely spherical particles of the hydrogel of salts without prior aging by washing,<br>
b)	extraction of at least 60% of the water present in the hydrogel by means of an organic iiquc<br>
c)	dryi-g of the resulting gel at up to 180°C and a reduced pressure cf 13 mbar for 30 minutes *-n til no further weight loss occurs (xerogel formation) and<br>
d)	adjustment of the particle diameter of the xerogel obtained to from 20 to 2000 urn.<br>
In the first step a) of the preparation of the support material, it is important tc use a silica hydrogel which has a -eiatively high solids content of from 10 to 25% by weight (calculated as Si02). preferably from '2 to 20% by weight, particularly preferably from 14 to 20% by //eight, and is largely<br><br>
spnencai. This silica -ydrogel has been prepared in a specific manner as described in steps a1) to a&amp;). The steos al   :o a3) are described in more detail in DE-A 21 03 243. Step a4',. viz. washing of the hycroce:. can be carried out in any desired manner for example by the ccuntercurrent principle using wate* .vnicn contains a small amount of ammonia (prl up to aoout 1C; and is at up :c 3C^C.<br>
Tne extraction c: re .vater from the hydroget (step b)) is preferably carried out using an organic iiquic. which is panic arly preferably miscibe with water, from the group consisting of d-C4-aicohols anc.or C:-Crotones. Particularly creferred alcohols are tert-butancL i-procanol, ethanol and methane Amc~g the ketones, preference is given to acetone. The organic liquid can also consist of mixtures ;*' the abevementioned organic liquids; in any case, the organic liquid contains less than 5% oy weignt, preferably iess than 3% by weight, of water prior tc the extraction. The extraction can be C3":ed out in customary extraction apparatuses, e.g. column extractors.<br>
Drying (step c;.) is ore'erably carried out at rom 30 to 140°C, particularly preferably from 80 to 110CC. and pressures of preferably from 1.3 mbar to atmospheric pressure. For reasons of the vapor pressu-e. a rise in temperature shoulc be accompanied by a rise in pressure and vice versa.<br>
The adjustment of the particle diameter of the resulting xerogel (step d)) car be carried out in any desired manner, e g. oy milling and sieving.<br>
A further preferred support material is produced, for example, by spray drying milled, appropriately sieved nydrogeis which are for this puroose mixed with water or an aliphatic alcohol. The primary particles are porous granular particies of the appropriately milled ana sieved hydrogei which have a mean particle diameter of from 1 to 20 um, preferably from 1 tc 5 um. Preference is given to using milled and sieved Si02 hydrogels.<br>
In general, the mean particle diameter of the support particles is in the range from 1 to 1000 um, preferably in tne range from 10 to 500 um and particularly preferably in the range from 30 to 150<br>
um.<br>
The mean average pore volume of the support material used is in the range from 0.1 to 10 ml/g, in particular frc~ 0.3 to 4.0 ml/g and particularly preferably from 1 to 25 ml/g.<br>
In general, re suooort particles have a specific surface area of from 10 tc '300 m2/g, in particular from 100 tc 530 m2/g. in particular from 20C to 550 m2/g.<br><br>
The specific surface area and the mean pore volume are determined by nitrogen adsorption in accordance with the BET method, as described, for example by S. Brunauer. P. Emmett and E. Teller in Journal of the American Chemical Society, 60, (1939). cages 209-319.<br>
In addition, the support particles used according to the present 'nver.ticn nave a mean core diameter of from 80 to 250 A, preferably from 90 to 210 A anc particularly prer'eraoiy from 95 to 200 A. The mean pore diameter in A is calculated by dividing the numerical value of the mean pore volume (in cm"7g) by the numerical value of the specific surface area (in m". g) and multiplying the result by 40 000. Suitable support materials are also commercially avaiiacie.<br>
The support material can also have been partially or fully modified before use in the process of the present invention. The support material can, for example, oe treated under oxidizing or non-oxidizing conditions at from 200 to 1000CC, in the presence or acsence of'iuorinating agents such as ammonium hexaflucrosilicate. In this way. it is possible, for example, to vary the water and/or OH group content. The support material is preferably dried uncer reducec pressure at from 100 to 200CC for from 1 to 10 hours before use in the process of the present invention.<br>

The reaction time is usually in the range from 10 seconds to 24 hours, preferably from 1 minute to 10 hours and particularly preferably from 10 minutes to 5 hours, before the protic medium is brought into contact with the support material.<br>
As titanium compound, preference is given to using a tetravalent compounc of the formula (RO)nX4-nTi, where the radicals R are identical or different and are each an organosilicon or car-boorganic substituent having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, e.g. a linear, brancned or cyclic C1-C20-alkyf group such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl. sec-butyl, isccutyl. tert-butyi, n-pentyl, sec-pentyl, isopentyl, n-hexyi, cyclohexyl, n-heptyl or n-octyl. a C=-C-3-aryl group such as phenyl, 1-naphthyl, 2-napthyl, 1-anthryl. 2-anthryl, 9-anthry! and l-penanthr/l or a trialkylsilyl group such as trimethylsilyl or tnethylsilyi.

In suspension, the reduction temperature is generally in the range from 10 to 200CC. preferacly in the range from 10 to 100°C, and the pressure is in the range from 0.1 to 500 bar preferably the range from 1 to 200 bar.<br>
The reduction temperature in fluidized-bed processes is usually in the range from 10 to 100CCC;   ■ preferably from 10 to 800°C, in particular from 10 to 600°C. In general, the gas-phase reduction is carried out in the pressure range from 0.1 to 500 bar. preferably in the range from 1 to 100 bar and in particular in the range from 5 to 20 bar.<br>
In the gas-phase reduction, the chromium catalyst to be reduced is generally fluidized by means of an inert carrier gas stream, for example nitrogen or argon, in a fiuidized-oed reactor. The carrier gas stream is usually laden with the reducing agent, with liquid reducing agents preferably having a vapor pressure of at least 1 mbar under normal conditions.<br>
The chromium catalyst of the present invention is very useful for the preparation of homopolymers of ethylene and copolymers of ethylene with a-olefins in the customary processes known for the polymerization of olefins at temperatures in the range from 20 to 300°C and pressures of from 5 to 400 bar, for example solution processes, suspension processes in stirring autoclaves or in a loop reactor, stirred gas phases or gas-phase fiuidized-bed processes, which may be carried out continuously or batchwise. The advantageous pressure and temperature ranges for carrying out the process accordingly depend greatly on the polymerization method.<br>
In particular, temperatures of from 50 to 150°C, preferably from 70 to 120'C, and pressures which are generally in the range from 1 to 400 bar are set in these polymerization processes. As solvent or suspension medium, it is possible to use inert hydrocarbons such as iscoutane or else the monomers themselves, for example higher olefins such as propene, butere or hexene in a liquefied or liquid state. The solids content of the suspension is generally in the -ange from 10 to 80% by weight. The polymerization can be carried out either batchwise, e.g. in stirring autoclaves, or continuously, e.g. in tube reactors, preferably in loop reactors. In particula' it can be carried out using the Phillips PF process as described in US-3 242 150 and US-3 2^6 179.<br><br>
Among the polymerization processes mentioned, gas-phase polymehzation. in particular in gas-phase fluidized-bed -eactors. is preferred according to the present invention. It has been found that despite the variety of processing steps and the spray-dried succort materials, no fine dust is formed during tne gas-phase polymerization  In general, it is carriec out at a temperature wr.ich is at least a few degrees under the softening temperature of the polymer. The gas-phase polymerization can also be carried out in the condensed, supercondensed c supercritical mode.<br>
The different polymerization processes, or even the same polymerization process, can, if desired. be connected in seres so as to form a polymerization cascade. However, the special catalyst composition makes it possible for the polymers accorcmg to the present invention to be reaaiiy obtained from a single reactor.<br>
Examples of suitable a-olefins which can be :opolymer;zed with ethylene are monoolefins and dioiefins having from three to 15 carbon atcms in the molecule. We:.-suited ^-olefins of this type are propene. 1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene, 1-octene. 1-decene. %dodecene and 1-pentadecene and also the conjugated and ncnconjugated dioiefins butadiene, penta-1,3-diene. 2,3-dimethylbutadiene, penta-1,4-diene. hexa-1,5-diene and vinylcyciohexene. Mixtures of these comonomers can also be used. Preference is given to using 1-butene. 1-hexene or 1-octene, in particular 1-hexene.<br>
To control the molar mass, hydrogen can advantageously be used as regulator in the polymerization.<br>
It has been found to be advantageous to carry out the polymerization of the 1-alkenes by means of the catalysts of the present invention in the presence of organometallic compounds of elements of the first, second, third or fourth main group or of the second transition group of the Periodic Table of the Elements. Well-suited compounds of this type are homcieptic C--C1c-alkyls of lithium, boron, aluminum or zinc, e.g. n-butyllithium, triethylboron. trimethylaiuminum. triethylaluminum, triisobutylaluminum, tributylaluminum, trihexylaluminum, trioctyiaiuminum and diethylzinc. Furthermore, C'-C^-dialkyialuminum alkoxides such as diethylaluminum methcxide are also well suited. It is aiso possible to use dimethylaiuminum chloride, methylaiuminum dichloride, methyl-aluminum sesquichlonde or diethylaluminum chloride. n-Butyllithium and trihexyialuminum are particularly preferred as organometallic compound. Mixtures of the aoove-described organometal-iic compouncs are generally also well suited.<br>
The molar ratio of organometallic compound:chromium is usually in tne range from 0.1:1 to 5G: 1, preferably m the range from 1:1 to 50:1. However, since many of the activators, e.g. aluminum alkyis, can a:so be used at the same time for removing catalyst poisons (known as scavengers), the amount used is dependent on the impurities present in the other starting materials. However, a person ski ed in the art can determine the optimum amount by means of simple tests.<br><br>
The chromium catalysts of the present invention can also be used together with another catalyst suitable for the polymerization of a-olefins in the above polymerization processes The chromium catalyst of the present invention is preferably used together with another suopcrtec chromium catalyst customary for the polymerization of ^-olefins. The use of two different succorted chrc-mium catalysts is described, for example, in WO 92/17511. The polymerization ca~ also be carried out using two or more of the chromium catalysts of the present invent,on simultaneously. The polymerization is particuiariy preferably carried out using a chromium catalyst acceding to the present invention together with a supported, nontitanized chromium catalyst. Mixtures of titanized and nontitanized supported chromium catalysts are described, for exampie. in US-2 798 202. but in that case the titamzation is carried out oniy after the chromium component has ceen applied to a support.<br>
The two different Phillips cataiysts can be mixed before they come into contact w:t~ the monomers and can then be introduced together into the reactor, or they can be introduced into the reactor separately from one another, for example at a plurality of points.<br>
The homopolymers and copolymers of ethylene prepared according to the oresent invention usually have a density, measured in accordance with DIN 53479. in the range "*rom 0.9 to 0.97 g/cm3, preferably in the range from 0.92 to 0.96 g/cm3 and particularly preferably .r, the range from 0.925 to 0.945 g/cm3, and a melt flow index (Ml (190°C/2.16 kg) or HLMI (190°C 21.6 kg);, measured in accordance with DIN 53735 under different loads (in brackets), in the range from G to 10 g/10 min, preferably in the range from 0.01 to 1 g/10 min and particularly preferably :- the range from 0.05 to 0.6 g/10 min, in the case of Ml and in the range from 1 to 50 g/10 min. preferably in the range from 3 to 30 g/10 min and particularly preferably in the range from 5 to 25 g/10 min. In the case of the HLMI.<br>
The weight average molar mass Mw is generally in the range from 10 000 tc 7 000 000 g/moL preferably in the range from 100 000 to 500 000 g/mol. The molar mass distribution M;v/Mn, measured by GPC (gel permeation chromatography) at 135°C in 1,2,4-trichlorccenzene using polyethylene standards, is usually in the range from 3 to 50, preferably in the range from S to 30 and particularly preferably in the range from 15 to 30.<br>
In general, the ethylene polymers produced in the reactor are melted and -omogenized in an extruder. The melt flow index and the density of the extrudate can then drer from the corresponding parameters for the crude polymer, but are also in the range specified according to the present invention.<br>
In the olefin polymerization in which the catalyst prepared according to the cresent invention is used, it is possible to prepare homopolymers of ethylene or copolymers c* ethylene with a co-<br><br>
monomer having from 3 to 12 carbon atoms in an amount of up to 10 moi% of comonomer in the copolymer. Preferred copolymers contain from 0.3 to 1,5 mol% of hexene. based on the polymer, particularly preferably from 0.5 to 1 mo!% c* nexene.<br>
The ethylene copolymer prepared according :o the present invention can also form mixtures with other olefin polymers, in particular homopolymers and copolymers of ethylene. These mixtures can, on the one hanc, be prepared by tne acove-described simultaneous polymerization of a plurality of chromium catalysts. On the other hand, these mixtures car also be obtained simply by suosequent blending of the polymers prepared according to the present invention with other ho-mopolymers or copolymers of ethylene. MF!  HLMI. density, comonomer content, Mw and Mw/Mn of these mixtures are preferably likewise in tne same ranges as these for the polymers which have been prepared using only a titanium-ccntaining chromium catalyst accorcing to the present invention.<br>
In addition, the ethylene copoiymers, polymer mixtures and blends can further comprise auxiliaries and/or additives known per se, e.g. processing stabilizers, stabilizers against the action of light and heat, customary additives such as .upricants, antioxidants, antiblocking agents and antistatics, and also, if desired, cciorants. The tyoe and amounts of these additives are well known to these skilled in the art.<br>
The polymers prepared according to the present invention can also be modified subsequently by grafting, crosslinking. hydrogenation or other functionalization reactions which are known to those skilled in the art.<br>
The polymers prepared according to the present invention are very useful for, for example, producing fiims on blown film plants at high outputs. Films comprising tne polymers prepared according to the present invention have good mechanical properties. The nigh puncture resistance of the films produced therefrom is also worthy of note.<br>
The films obtained in this way are suitable, in particular, for the packaging sector and for large, heavy duty sacks and also for the food sector. Furthermore, the films have only a low blocking tendency anc can therefore be passed through machines without use of lubricants and antiblocking additives or with use of only small amounts thereof.<br>
The Phillips catalyst prepared according to the present invention has particular unexpected advantages. It is very useful for the homopolymerization and copolymerization of ethylene by the customany arc known particle form processes in a gas-phase fluidlzed-bec polymerization. Here, it gives, at a nigh productivity, (co)polymers having excellent morphology and good processability. In particular, tne catalyst of the present invention displays a good comonomer incorporation behavior and gves high productivities even at iow activation temperat^es. The (copolymers pre-<br><br>
pared by means of the Phillips catalyst of the present invention are therefore particularly useful for processing by the blown film process and the blow molding process.<br>
The following examples illustrate the invention.<br>
The productivity of the catalyst is reported as the amount of polymer isolated per amount of Phillips catalyst used in g.<br>

Examples and Comparative Experiments<br>
Example 1<br>
The support material was prepared as described in DE 2 540 279.<br>
Preparation of the silica xerogel<br>
A mixing nozzle as shown in the figure in DE-A 2 103 243 and having the following data was utilized: the diameter of :ne cylindrical mixing chamber formed by a plastic tube is 14 mm, the length of the mixing zone (including after-mixing section) is 350 mm. The end of the mixing chamber nearest the inlet is cicsed off and near this end there is a tangential inlet hole having a diameter of 4 mm for the mineral acid." Four further holes likewise having a diameter of 4 mm and the same inflow direction for the water glass solution follow, with the spacing of the holes^ measured in the longitudinal direction of the mixing chamber, being 30 mm. Accordingly, the ratio of length to diameter of the primary mixing zone is about 10:1. For the subsequent secondary mixing zone, this ratio is 15. As spraying nozzle, a flattened, slightly kidney shaped piece of tube was pushed over the outlet end of the plastic tube.<br>
This mixing apparatus was supplied with 325 l/h of 33 percent strength by weight sulfuric acid at 20°C and an operating pressure of about 3 bar and also 1100 l/h of water glass solution (prepared from technical-grade water glass containing 27% by weight of Si02 and 8% by weight of Na20 by dilution with water) having a density of 1.20 kg/I and a temperature of likewise 20°C and a pressure of likewise about 3 bar. Progressive neutralization in the mixing chamber lined with the plastic tube resulted in formation of an unstable hydrosol which had a pH of 7-3 and remained in the after-mixing zone for about 0.1 s until completely homogenized before it was sprayed through the nozzle attachment inic the atmosphere as a fan-shaped liquid jet. During its flight through the air, the jet broke ,o into individual droplets which, as a result of the surface tension, took on a largely spherical shace and solidified to form hydrogel spheres within about one second while still in flight. The spheres had a smooth surface, were clear as glass, contained aoout 17% by weight of Si02 and hac the following particle size distribution:<br>
&gt; 8 mm	10% by weight<br>
5-8 mm	45% by weight<br><br>
4-6 mm	34% by weight<br>
(The particle s;ze distributer can be varied a; will by use of other nozzle attachments.) The ny-drogel spheres were collectec at the end of ;-e;r flight In a scrubbing tower whic~ ,vas filled almost completely with hydrcgei spheres and ,r. which the spneres were washed free of salts immediately without aging by means of water containing a little ammonia and having a temperature of about 50°C ;n a continuous countercurrer: process.<br>
The spheres wnich had a ciameier in tne range from 2 to 5 mm were isc;ated by sieving and 112 kg of these spneres were c.aced in an extraction vessel which had an in;et at the top. a sieve bottom and swan-neck shaced overflow whicn is connected to the bottom of the drum and keeps the liquid level in the arum sufficiently high for the hydrogel spheres to be completely covered with liquid. The hycrogel was extracted by means of methanol.<br>
The spheres obtained in this way were then dried (12 hours at 120~C under a pressure of 20 mbar) until no further weight loss occurred a: 180°C under a pressure of 13 mbar over a period of 30 minutes.<br>
The spheres which had been dried in this way were subsequently milled and the xerogel particles which have a diameter of from 40 to 300 urn were isolated by sieving. The pore volume was 1.9 ml/g.<br>

The solution obtained in this way was added to 150 g of the above-described silica gel support. The suspension was stirred for 1 hour and then evaporated to dryness on a rotary evaporator at 80°C with application of a vacuum. The precatalyst obtained in this way contains 1 % by weight of chromium and 4% by weight of titanium, based on the weight of the precatalyst.<br>
