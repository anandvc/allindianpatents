NETWORK-INITIATED AREA EVENT TRIGGERED PO-<br>
SITIONING METHOD FOR ROAMING TERMINAL IN MOBILE<br>
COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
Technical Solution<br>
[1]	The present invention relates to a mobile communication system and, more par-<br>
ticularly, to a network-initiated area event triggered positioning method for a roaming<br>
terminal in a session-based position information system.<br>
[2]	In a mobile communication system a function part for calculating a position of a<br>
terminal is included in a mobile communication network to provide a location service<br>
for transferring a location of a terminal to a certain entity periodically or according to a<br>
user request. A network structure related to the location service varies depending on an<br>
internal network structure such as 3GPP or 3GPP2, etc.<br>
[3]	Methods for calculating the position of the terminal in the mobile communication<br>
system include a cell-ID method in which an id of a cell to which the terminal belongs<br>
is transferred, a method in which time taken for radiowaves to arrive at each base<br>
station from the terminal is measured and then the position of the terminal is calculated<br>
by using triangulation, and a method using GPS.<br>
[4]	In order to provide the location service to a user by using the position calculating<br>
methods, considerable signaling and position information should be transferred<br>
between the mobile terminal and a position server. Thus, recently, standardized po-<br>
sitioning technologies for providing the location service, namely, the location services<br>
based on the position of the mobile terminal, are widely adopted. The positioning<br>
technologies can be provided through a user plane and a control plane, and the SUPL<br>
(Secure User Plane location) that provides the location service through the user plane<br>
is a typical example of the technologies.<br>
[5]	The SUPL, which is effective for transferring position information required for<br>
calculating the position of the mobile terminal, transfers position assistance in-<br>
formation such as GPS assistance and uses a user plane data bearer in order to<br>
transport positioning technology-related protocols between the mobile terminal and the<br>
network.<br>
[61	In general, in the position information system, a location service-related SUPL<br>
network includes a SUPL agent, an SLP (SUPL Location Platform) and an SET (SUPL<br>
Enabled Terminal). The SUPL agent indicates a logical service access point that uses<br>
actually measured position information, and the SLP indicates an SUPL service access<br>
 <br>
point of the network that accesses network resources to obtain position information.<br>
[7]	The SET is a device that communicates with the SUPL network using the SUPL<br>
interface, which can be, for example, a UE (User Equipment) of a UMTS, an MS<br>
(Mobile Station) of GSM, an IS-95 MS, or a laptop computer or a PDA having the<br>
SET function. The SET can be also various other types of mobile terminals that are<br>
connected through a WLAN.<br>
[8]	The SET supports procedures defined in the SUPL by interworking with the network<br>
through the user plane bearer. In this case, the network to which the user had initially<br>
registered may be called a home network, and the network of an area where the user<br>
moves into from the home network area may be called a visited network. An SLP of<br>
the home network may be called an H-SLP (Home-SLP) and an SLP of the visited<br>
network may be called a V-SLP (Visited-SLP). When the SUPL procedure starts in the<br>
network, an SLP to which an external client is first connected may be called an R-SLP<br>
(Requesting SLP). The R-SLP can be a logical entity which is the same as the H-SLP<br>
or not. The SET for current positioning can be defined as the target SET.<br>
[9]	The SLP, a network element includes an SPC (SUPL Positioning Center) that<br>
calculates an actual location and an SLC (SUPL Location Center) that performs other<br>
roles of the SLP that calculates the position information, namely, roaming and resource<br>
management, etc. Thus, the SET may calculate the position information through com-<br>
munication with the SPC via the SLC (proxy mode) or calculate the position in-<br>
formation by being immediately connected with the SPC (non-proxy mode).<br>
[10]	However, although the related art provides the immediate positioning method based<br>
on the SUPL, it fails to propose area-based, area-related or area event triggered po-<br>
sitioning for the SUPL-based roaming terminal.<br>
[ll]	Therefore, in order to address the above matters the various features described herein<br>
have been conceived. One aspect of the exemplary embodiments is to provide a<br>
network-initiated area event triggered positioning method for a roaming terminal based<br>
on an SUPL capable of allowing a roaming terminal to be positioned effectively in<br>
various manners.<br>

terminal through the session response message. The first sever can be an H-SLP and<br>
the second server can be a V-SLP.<br>

to check whether an area event trigger condition is met; and sending, by the roaming<br>
terminal, the measured position value to the first server when the area event trigger<br>
condition is met.<br>
[17]	The roaming terminal may receive area ids related to area-based positioning from the<br>
first server through the session response message.<br>
[18]	This specification also provides a network-initiated area event triggered positioning<br>
method for a roaming terminal in a mobile communication system that may include:<br>
sending, by a first server, a session initiation message for initiating a trigger session to<br>
the roaming terminal; receiving a session start message including parameters related to<br>
setting at least a security session from the roaming terminal; requesting, by the first<br>
server, area ids related to area-based (area-related or area event-triggered) positioning<br>

[26] The foregoing and other objects, features, aspects and advantages of the present<br>
invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description of the<br>
present invention when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>
[27] The accompanying drawings, which are included to provide a further understanding<br>
of the invention and are incorporated in and constitute a part of this specification,<br>
illustrate embodiments of the invention and together with the description serve to<br>
explain the principles of the invention.<br>
[28]	In the drawings:<br>
[29]	FIG. 1 is a network-initiated area event triggered positioning method according to a<br>
first exemplary embodiment of the present invention;<br>
[30] FIG. 2 is a network-initiated area event triggered positioning method according to a<br>
second exemplary embodiment of the present invention;<br>
[31]	FIG. 3 is a network-initiated area event triggered positioning method according to a<br>
third exemplary embodiment of the present invention; and<br>
[32] FIG. 4 is a network-initiated area event triggered positioning method according to a<br>
fourth exemplary embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[33] Exemplary embodiments of the present invention will now be described in detail.<br>
[34]	The present invention is implemented in an SUPL network, and without being<br>
limited thereto, the present invention can be also applicable to any wireless com-<br>
munication system that may be operated according to a different specification.<br>
[35]	In the present invention, in a session-based position information system, when a<br>
server and a terminal manage positioning-related trigger information, an area event<br>
triggered positioning procedure with respect to a terminal which has roamed to a<br>
visited network (in case where the terminal moves into a particular position, con-<br>
tinuously exists in a particular area, or moves out of the particular area) is provided.<br>
[36] In the area event triggered positioning, a home network requests area id(s) set for the<br>
area-based positioning from the visited network, obtains area id(s), and provides the<br>
obtained area id(s) to the roaming terminal (namely, a target SET).<br>
[37]	In the area-based (area-related or area event-triggered) positioning, the roaming<br>
terminal is not continuously positioned but it is first checked whether the roaming<br>
terminal has approached a particular area (requested area or an event area), and when<br>
the roaming terminal has approached the particular area, the roaming terminal po-<br>
sitioning procedure starts. The roaming terminal determines whether to start or not the<br>
 <br>
positioning procedure according to whether a positioning start condition is met or not.<br>
The positioning start condition being met means that the roaming terminal is near (or<br>
has approached) an area (e.g., a particular area, a requested area, or an event area) that<br>
is specified in the area event trigger condition information.<br>
[38] When the calculated actual position of the roaming terminal is in an area specified in<br>
the area event trigger condition information (namely, when the area event trigger<br>
condition is met), the roaming terminal determines that the area event has occurred and<br>
sends the calculated position value to a client (terminal or an agent included in a<br>
network).<br>
[39] Here, the occurrence of the area event refers to the confirmation as to whether the<br>
terminal has moved into the particular area, moves out of the area, or exists in the area.<br>
[40] In general, the positioning service provided in the SUPL-based position information<br>
system is classified into a network-initiated case and a SET-initiated case.<br>
[41]	In addition, the SUPL-based positioning service is discriminated in a proxy mode in<br>
which the H-SLP of the home network is operated as a proxy so the positioning<br>
procedure is performed between the position server and a roaming SET necessarily<br>
through the H-SLP, and a non-proxy mode in which the H-SLP is operated in a non-<br>
proxy mode so the positioning procedure is performed directly between the position<br>
server and the roaming SET without going through the H-SLP. Here, the position<br>
server can be the H-SLP or the V-SLP.<br>
[42] Types of services can be divided (classified) according to whether the H-SLP (or H-<br>
SPC) or the V-SLP (or the V-SPC) performs the positioning function for calculating<br>
the position of the roaming SET, when the network initiates a service.<br>
[43] In the present disclosure, for the case where the network initiates a service, four<br>
exemplary embodiments will be described according to whether or not the proxy mode<br>
is used and the position server being an SLP of which particular network.<br>
[44] First, network-initiated area event triggered positioning method for the roaming<br>
terminal according to a first exemplary embodiment of the present invention will now<br>
be described.<br>
[45] FIG. 1 is a network-initiated area event triggered positioning method according to the<br>
first exemplary embodiment of the present invention, showing a roaming case, a<br>
network-initiated case, a V-SLP positioning case and the proxy mode. Namely, the<br>
SET (namely, target SET) is the roaming SET which has roamed to the visited network<br>
to which the V-SLP belongs, the V-SLP performs the positioning function (namely, the<br>
V-SLP is operated as the position server), and the H-SLP uses the proxy mode.<br>
[46]	As shown in FIG. 1, when an area-based positioning is requested from an external<br>
LCS (Location Services) client, the SUPL agent sends an MLP (Mobile Location<br>
Protocol) TLRR (Triggered Location Reporting Request) message to the H-SLP in<br>
 <br>
order to request an area-based positioning service (area event trigger service) (step<br>
S10).<br>
[47] The MLP TLRR message includes parameters such as ms-id, client-id, QoP and<br>
tlrr_event, etc. The ms-id indicates a target SET, and the client-id indicates an id of the<br>
SUPL agent. The QoP indicates precision degree of positioning (temporal delay and<br>
spatial precision). The tlrr_event is a positioning related trigger parameter and can be<br>
various information regarding positioning related condition information such as a<br>
change_area type of area-based positioning (whether the roaming terminal moves into<br>
a particular area, moves out of the particular area, or is located in the particular area,<br>
etc.), the particular area (the name of the particular area or precise position value), and<br>
the like.<br>
[48] When there are several types of positioning values or when there are several requests<br>
for positions, the MLP TLRR message may include a parameter, or the like, for setting<br>
priority with respect to each request for positions.<br>
[49] Upon receiving the MLP TLRR, the H-SLP authenticates the SUPL agent and checks<br>
if the SUPL agent is authorized for the service it requests, based on the client-id.<br>
[50]	In addition, the H-SLP may apply a subscriber privacy function to the SUPL agent<br>
based on the received ms-id.<br>
[51] The H-SLP verifies that the target SET (referred to as 'SET' hereinafter) supports<br>
SUPL by using a SET look-up table, and also verifies that the SET is currently SUPL<br>
roaming (step S11).<br>
[52]	When the SET supports the SUPL and is currently roaming, the SLP sends an SUPL<br>
INIT message to the SET to start an area event triggered session with the SET (step<br>
SI2). The SUPL INIT message can be transmitted through a WAP (Wireless Ap-<br>
plication Protocol) Push, an SMS (Short Message Service) trigger, an SIP (Session<br>
Initiation Protocol) Push, an UDP/IP, etc.<br>
[53] The SUPL INIT message may contain a session-ID, a trigger type indicator (e.g.,<br>
area event), an SLP mode (proxy/non-proxy mode indicator), and an intended po-<br>
sitioning method parameter.<br>
[54]	Before performing the step S11, the H-SLP may verify (check) privacy of the SET,<br>
and in this case, if notification or verification to the target subscriber (user) is needed,<br>
the H-SLP may also include a notification parameter (notification element) in the<br>
SUPL INIT message.<br>
[55]	As the H-SLP sends the SUPL INIT message including the trigger type indicator, the<br>
SET can be aware that the area-based positioning has been currently requested through<br>
the trigger type parameter included in the received SUPL INIT message.<br>
[56]	Upon receiving the SUPL INIT message, if the SET is not already attached or<br>
establish a circuit switched data connection with a network, the SET establishes a data<br>
 <br>
connection with a packet data network (3GPP or 3GPP2) (step S13).<br>
[57] In addition, in order to determine if the H-SLP uses the proxy mode or the non-proxy<br>
mode, the SET checks an SLP mode parameter contained in the SUPL INIT message.<br>
When the SLP mode parameter indicates the proxy mode, the SET determines that the<br>
H-SLP uses the proxy mode and establishes a secure IP (Internet Protocol) connection<br>
to the H-SLP. In this case, the IP connection is established to the SET using the<br>
address of the H-SLP that has been provisioned by the home network.<br>
[58] When the data connection is established, the SET sends a SUPL TRIGGERED<br>
START message to the H-SLP operating as the proxy in order to start an area event<br>
triggered session (step SI4). The SUPL TRIGGERED START message contains at<br>
least session-ID, lid (location identifier) and SET capability information. The lid is an<br>
identifier of a current position of the SET and indicates an id of a cell in which the SET<br>
is currently located.<br>
[59] When the SUPL TRIGGERED START message is received, the H-SLP determines<br>
the V-SLP based on the lid included in the SUPL TRIGGERED START message. And<br>
then, the H-SLP sends an RLP (Roaming Location Protocol) TSRLRR (Triggered<br>
Standard Roaming Location Reporting Request) message including the SUPL<br>
TRIGGERRED START message to the V-SLP to inform the V-SLP that the target<br>
SET will initiate a SUPL positioning procedure (step SI5).<br>
[60]	The H-SLP should include area-ids request indicator parameter and a tlrr_event<br>
parameter which was contained in the MLP TLRR message in the step S10 (namely,<br>
parameters related to the area event trigger such as the area information requested by<br>
the SUPL agent), in the SUPL TRIGGERD START message.<br>
[61 ] By sending the RLP TSRLRR message, the H-SLP requests area ids used for the area<br>
event triggered session from the V-SLP.<br>
[62] Upon receiving the RLP TSRLRR message, the V-SLP determines a positioning<br>
method (posmethod) to be used for the area event triggered session from the SET ca-<br>
pabilities included in the RLP TSRLRR message. And, the V-SLP sends an RLP<br>
TSRLRA (Triggered Standard Roaming Location Reporting Answer) message<br>
including SUPL TRIGGER RESPONSE message information to the H-SLP in order to<br>
inform the H-SLP about its readiness for an area event triggered session.<br>
[63]	The V-SLP also checks the area ids request indicator included in the RLP TSRLRR<br>
message. If area ids are requested by the H-SLP, the V-SLP should include area ids<br>
corresponding to the areas for the area event triggered session in the SUPL TRIGGER<br>
RESPONSE message and then send an RLP TSRLRA message including the SUPL<br>
TRIGGER RESPONSE message information (step Sl6).<br>
[64] The H-SLP forwards the received SUPL TRIGGER RESOPNSE message including<br>
session-ID, the positioning method (posmethod) and the trigger parameters<br>
 <br>
(trigger-Params) to the SET.<br>
[65] The trigger parameters indicate trigger condition information related to the area event<br>
trigger for positioning.<br>
[66] For example, the trigger parameter may contain trigger condition information<br>
indicating the change_area type of the area event and a particular area (or an event<br>
area). The change_area type of the area event (it can be referred to lie change_area<br>
type related to area-based positioning or the change_area type related to area event<br>
triggered positioning) may indicate whether the roaming terminal is moved into the<br>
particular area, moved out of the particular area, or is located in the particular area. The<br>
particular area may include at least one of the name of an administrative district, the<br>
name of an area, and latitude and longitude of a particular position.<br>
[67] The H-SLP may selectively include the area ids or location identifiers (lids) of the<br>
specified area for the area event triggered session in the SUPL TRIGGER RESPONSE<br>
message (step S17).<br>
[68] Preferably, the area ids can be information indicating a location area in the actual<br>
network such as ids of cells belonging to the area required for positioning by the SUPL<br>
agent, a mobile country code (MCC), a mobile network code (MNC) or a location area<br>
code (LAC), etc., or a primary scrambling code number. In particular, in case of the<br>
WCDMA, the area ids may correspond to the primary scrambling code number.<br>
[69]	And then, H-SLP informs the SUPL agent in an MLP TLRA (Triggered Location<br>
Reporting Answer) message that the triggered location response request has been<br>
accepted (step SI8).<br>
[70] The H-SLP includes a request id parameter (req_id) of the MLP TLRA message to<br>
be used as a transaction id for the entire duration of the area event triggered session.<br>
[71 ] Thereafter, the SET may release the secure IP connection with the H-SLP.<br>
[72] When the area id (or area ids) is/are received in the SUPL TRIGGER RESPONSE<br>
MESSAE, the SET checks whether the positioning session start condition is met.<br>
[73]	For example, whether the positioning session start condition is met or not can be<br>
checked by comparing the current area id of the SET and area ids received from the H-<br>
SLP.<br>
[74] Namely, the SET compares the current area id (namely, the ID of the cell in which<br>
the SET is currently located) and the received area ids (namely, the received cell ids) to<br>
check whether there is the same area id.<br>
[75]	When the change_area type of the area event included in the trigger parameters<br>
(trigger_params) indicates that SET moves into the particular area or in the particular<br>
area and at least one of the received area ids is identical to the current area id of the<br>
SET, the SET starts the positioning session. That is, when at least one of the received<br>
area ids is identical to the current area id of the SET, the SET determines that the po-<br>
 <br>
sitioning session start condition is met.<br>
[76]	When the change_area type of the area event indicates that the SET moves out of the<br>
particular area and the received area ids and the current area id of the SET are not<br>
identical, the SET determines that the positioning session start condition is met.<br>
[77]	The comparison of the current area id to the received area ids or the area event<br>
trigger in the SET indicates that a position fix has to be performed. Namely, the SET<br>
verifies its substantial position and checks whether it has approached to the area<br>
requested by the SUPL agent. Accordingly, the position of the SET is not always<br>
calculated (trackedO but when the SET is determined to have approached to the<br>
requested area, the SET informs that the positioning session should start and the<br>
position server (in this case, the V-SLP) starts to calculate the position of the SET.<br>
[78]	When it is verified that the positioning session start condition is met by comparing<br>
the area ids, the SET recognizes that it has currently approached to the requested are<br>
and sends an SUPL POSINIT message to the H-SLP to initiate the positioning session<br>
(that may be called a position calculation session) (step S19). The SUPL POS INIT<br>
message contains at least session-ID and the current area id of the SET. Here, if the<br>
SET is not already attached or establishes a circuit switched data connection, it<br>
attaches itself to the packet data network and sends the SUPL POS [NTT message to<br>
the H-SLP to start the positioning session with the V-SLP.<br>
[79]	The H-SLP serving as the proxy forwards the received SUPL POST INIT message to<br>
the V-SLP performing the positioning function using an RLP SSRP message (step<br>
S20).<br>
[80] Upon receiving the RLP SSRP message, if a position value (e.g., the cell id)<br>
calculated based on information received in the RLP SSRP message is available that<br>
meets the required QoP, the V-SLP may directly proceed to step S22, omitting the step<br>
S21. If the calculated position value (cell id) does not meet the required QoP, the V-<br>
SLP proceeds to the step S21. Thus, it can be noted that the cell id-based positioning<br>
method is not used in the step S21.<br>
[81]	The SET and the V-SLP may exchange several successive message for performing<br>
actual positioning through the H-SLP to calculate the position of the SET (step S21).<br>
Preferably, the messages exchanged between the V-SLP and the SET contain the<br>
session-ID and protocols (RRLP, RRC or TIA-801), etc., to be used for the po-<br>
sitioning. The V-SLP calculates the position estimate based on the positioning mea-<br>
surements received from the SET (SET-assisted mode), or the SET calculates the<br>
position estimate based on assistance obtained from the V-SLP (SET-based mode), In<br>
the first exemplary embodiment as shown in FIG. 1, the calculation of the position is<br>
performed in the SET-assisted mode, the V-SLP sends the calculated position result<br>
(posresult) in an SUPL REPORT message to the SET via the H-SLP (steps S22 and<br>
 <br>
S23). When the calculation of the position is performed in the SET-based mode, the<br>
SUPL REPORT message is not necessary.<br>
[82]	When the position result of the SET is received from the V-SLP via the H-SLP, the<br>
SET compares the calculated position estimate and a position value of the particular<br>
area (event area) specified in the trigger parameter to check if the area event trigger<br>
condition has been met, namely, whether the area event has occurred.<br>
[83] Upon comparison, when the position result of the SET is not identical to the position<br>
value specified in the trigger parameter, the SET determines that the area event trigger<br>
condition has not been met (namely, the area event has not occurred) (step S24) and<br>
proceeds back to the step S19 to send the SUPL POS EMIT message again to the V-<br>
SLP via the H-SLP (steps S19 and S20).<br>
[84] If, however, the position estimate of the SET is identical to the position value<br>
specified in the trigger parameter (namely, when the area event has occurred) (step<br>
S24), the SET sends the SUPL REPORT message to the H-SLP (step S25). The SUPL<br>
REPORT message contains the calculated position estimate received from the V-SLP<br>
and the session ID.<br>
[85] The H-SLP sends the calculated position estimate of the SET and the requested id<br>
(req-id) in an MLP TLREP message to the SUPL agent (step S26).<br>
[86] When a response to the positioning report requested by the SUPL agent is sent, the<br>
SET waits for a certain time.<br>
[87]	And then, the SET repeats the steps S19 to S26 or the steps S19 toS24 depending on<br>
if the area event condition is fulfilled or not (step S27).<br>
[88]	When the last report of the reports required by the SUPL agent has been sent, the H-<br>
SLP sends an SUPL END message to the SET to inform the SET that the positioning<br>
session has been ended. Then, the SET and the V-SLP release all the resources related<br>
to the positioning session, respectively (step S28).<br>
[89] In the first exemplary embodiment of the present invention as illustrated in FIG. 1,<br>
when the network initiates the positioning service, the V-SLP having the positioning<br>
function wants to check (calculate) the area-based position of the roaming SET, the<br>
roaming SET and the V-SLP establish the area event triggered session via the H-SLP<br>
operating as the proxy and calculate the area-based position of the roaming SET.<br>
[90]	An area-based positioning method according to the second exemplary embodiment of<br>
the present invention will now be described.<br>
[91]	FIG. 2 is a network-initiated area event triggered positioning method according to a<br>
second exemplary embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[92] In the area-based positioning method according to the second exemplary embodiment<br>
of the present invention, a roaming case, a network-initiated case, an H-SLP po-<br>
sitioning case and a proxy mode are implemented. Compared with the first exemplary<br>
 <br>
embodiment of the present invention, the H-SLP has the positioning function in the<br>
second exemplary embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[93]	In the second exemplary embodiment of the present invention, an area event<br>
triggered session is established in the same manner as that (steps S10 to SI8) of the<br>
first exemplary embodiment of the present invention shown in FIG. 1 (A-I).<br>
[94]	When a positioning session start condition is met, the SET (roaming SET) sends an<br>
SUPL POS INIT message containing at least current area id (lid) and a SET id (ms id)<br>
to the H-SLP serving as a proxy in order to start the procedure for calculating the<br>
position of the SET itself (J).<br>
[95]	The H-SLP serving as the proxy (namely, which uses the proxy mode) sends the<br>
received current area id (lid) and the SET id (ms id) in an RLP SRLIR message to the<br>
V-SLP (K).<br>
[96]	The V-SLP translates the current area id (lid) to a position estimate and returns the<br>
position estimate to the H-SLP (L).<br>
[97]	The H-SLP checks if the returned position estimate satisfies the QoP, and when the<br>
returned position estimate satisfies the QoP, the H-SLP sends the returned position<br>
estimate in an SUPL REPORT message to the SET without performing the positioning<br>
(SUPL POS) procedure (M, N).<br>
[98]	If, however, the returned position estimate does not satisfy the QoP, the H-SLP<br>
performs the positioning (SUPL POS) procedure to calculate a position estimate of the<br>
SET and send the calculated position estimate in the SUPL REPORT message to the<br>
SET (M, N).<br>
[99]	Thereafter, the H-SLP checks whether an area event has occurred, and provides a<br>
precise area-based position value of the SET to the SUPL agent according to whether<br>
the area event has occurred or not, likewise as in the first exemplary embodiment of<br>
the present invention.<br>
[100] In the second exemplary embodiment of the present invention, when the network<br>
initiates the area-based positioning service of the roaming SET which has roamed to<br>
the V-SLP, the area event triggered session is established between the V-SLP and the<br>
roaming SET via the H-SLP serving as the proxy, and when the SUPL POS INIT<br>
message if sent from the roaming SET as the positioning session start condition is met,<br>
the H-SLP calculates an actual position of the roaming SET.<br>
[101] A network-initiated area event triggered positioning method according to a third<br>
exemplary embodiment of the present invention will be described.<br>
[102] FIG. 3 is a network-initiated area event triggered positioning method according to a<br>
third exemplary embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[103] In the third exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a roaming case, a<br>
network-initiated case, a V-SLP positioning case and a case where the H-SLP uses the<br>
 <br>
non-proxy mode are implemented. The SET (target SET) is a roaming SET which has<br>
roamed to the V-SLP and the V-SLP performs the positioning function.<br>
[ 104] The V-SLP includes the V-SPC and the V-SLC, and specifically, the V-SPC<br>
performs the positioning function. The H-SLP includes the H-SLC and the H-SPC.<br>
Only the H-SLC is shown in FIG. 3, and the H-SLC uses the non-proxy mode.<br>
[105] Steps S30 to S33 perform the same process as the steps S10 to S13 in FIG. 1.<br>
[106] In step S32, upon checking an SLP mode value contained in the SUPL ENIT message<br>
transmitted from the H-SLC, the roaming SET recognizes that the H-SLC uses the<br>
non-proxy mode.<br>
[107] In order to start the area-based event triggered session, the SET sends an SUPL<br>
TRIGGERED START message containing at least a session ID, location id (lid) and<br>
SET capabilities to the H-SLC. The SET also includes SET nonce and key-id 2 in the<br>
SUPL TRIGGERED START message and sends it for authentication required in the<br>
non-proxy mode. The key-id 2 corresponds to a key for generating a security key to be<br>
used for setting a security session (PSK-TLS sessionO between the V-SPC and the SET<br>
(step S34).<br>
[ 108] The H-SLC determines the V-SLC and sends an RLP TSRLRR message including<br>
the SUPL TRIGGERED START message to the V-SLC to inform the V-SLC that the<br>
SET has initiated the SUPL positioning procedure.<br>
[109] In this case, the H-SLC should include an area ids request indicator parameter and<br>
the tlrr_event which has been included in the MLP TLRR message in the step S30<br>
(namely, parameters related to the area event trigger such as the area information<br>
requested by the SUPL agent) in the RLP TSRLRR message (step S35).<br>
[110] Thus, by sending the RLP TSRLRR message, the H-SLC requests the area ids used<br>
for the area event triggered session from the V-SLC.<br>
[1ll] The V-SLC informs the V-SPC about the area event triggered session through<br>
internal communication. The V-SLC generates a key to be used for mutual au-<br>
thentication between the V-SPC and the SET by using the key-id 2 and the SET nonce,<br>
and sends the generated key to the V-SPC through internal communication. The V-<br>
SPC accepts or refuses the request related to the area event triggered session and<br>
informs the V-SLC about a corresponding result (step S36).<br>
[112] The V-SLC checks the area ids request indicator transmitted from the H-SLC, and if<br>
area ids have been requested by the H-SLC, the V-SLC should include area ids cor-<br>
responding to the area for the area event triggered session in a SUPL TRIGGERED<br>
RESPONSE message.<br>
[113] The V-SLC determines a positioning method (posmethod) to be used for the area<br>
event triggered session according to the SET capabilities received in the step S35 and<br>
sends an RLP TSRLRA message including the SUPL TRIGGERED RESPONSE<br>
 <br>
message to the H-SLC to inform the H-SLC about its readiness for an area event<br>
triggered session (step S37).<br>
[114] The H-SLC generates a key (security key: PSK_SPC_Key) to be used for mutual au-<br>
thentication between the V-SPC and the SET and sends the generated key (security<br>
key) to the V-SLC via an AUTH RESP message by using an RLP SSRP tunnel (step<br>
S38).<br>
[115] The V-SLC sends the received key (security key) to the V-SPC through internal<br>
communication (step S39).<br>
[116] The H-SLC sends the SUPL TRIGGERED RESPONSE message received from the<br>
V-SLC to the SET. The SUPL TRIGGERED RESOPNSE message contains session-<br>
ID, posmethod, V-SPC address and a trigger parameter (trigger_params). The V-SPC<br>
address indicates the address of the V-SPC that performs the positioning function. The<br>
trigger parameter indicates trigger condition information related to the area event<br>
trigger for positioning.<br>
[117] For example, the trigger parameter may contain trigger condition information<br>
indicating the change_area type of the area event and a particular area. The<br>
change_area type of the area event may indicate whether the roaming terminal is<br>
moved into the particular area, moved out of the particular area, or is located in the<br>
particular. The particular area may include at least one of the name of an admin-<br>
istrative district, the name of an area, and latitude and longitude of a particular<br>
position.<br>
[118] The area ids or location identifiers (lids) of the specified area for the area event<br>
triggered session may be included in the SUPL TRIGGER RESPONSE message.<br>
[119] Preferably, the area ids can be information indicating a location area in the actual<br>
network such as ids of cells belonging to the area required for positioning by the SUPL<br>
agent, a mobile country code (MCC), a mobile network code (MNC) or a location area<br>
code (LAC), etc., or a primary scrambling code number. In particular, in case of the<br>
WCDMA, the area ids may correspond to the primary scrambling code number.<br>
[120] Thereafter, steps S41 to S51 are performed in the almost similar manner as the steps<br>
SI8 to S28 illustrated in FIG. 1 and only the differences therebetween will now be<br>
described.<br>
[121] In the first exemplary embodiment as shown in FIG. 1, when the positioning session<br>
start condition is met, the SET sends the SUPL POS INIT message to the V-SLP via<br>
the H-SLP (steps S19 and S20). Comparatively, in the third exemplary embodiment of<br>
the present invention as shown in FIG. 3, when the positioning session start condition<br>
is met, the SET directly sends the SUPL POS INIT message to the V-SPC cor-<br>
responding to the address of the V-SPC included in the SUPL TRIGGERED<br>
RESPONSE message received in step S40.<br>
 <br>
[122] Accordingly, in step S43, the V-SPC directly opens the positioning session with the<br>
SET without going through the H-SLC.<br>
[123] Meanwhile, in step S21 in FIG. 1, the V-SLP opens the positioning session with the<br>
SET via the proxy H-SLP and sends and receives successive messages for calculating<br>
the position via the H-SLP to calculate the actual position of the SET.<br>
[124] Comparatively, in step S43, the calculated position value of the SET is sent from the<br>
V-SPC to the SET, and the SET checks if an area event has occurred based on the<br>
calculated position value of the SET. Namely, the SET compares the calculated<br>
position value and the position value of the event area specified in the trigger<br>
parameter to check whether they are the same.<br>
[125] The SET may report the calculated position value to the H-SLC by sending the SUPL<br>
REPORT message, or may send again the SUPL POS INIT message to the V-SPC,<br>
according to whether the area event occurs or not.<br>
[126] As mentioned above, in the third exemplary embodiment of the present invention as<br>
shown in FIG. 3, when the network initiates the positioning service and the V-SPC<br>
having the positioning function wants to check (calculate) area-based position of the<br>
roaming SET, the H-SLC obtains the area ids specified for the area event triggered<br>
session from the V-SLC and provides them to the roaming SET, and the roaming SET<br>
and the V-SPC directly set a positioning session therebetween without going through<br>
the H-SLP serving as the non-proxy and calculates the area-based position of the<br>
roaming SET.<br>
[127] A network-initiated area event triggered positioning method according to a fourth<br>
exemplary embodiment of the present invention will be described.<br>
[128] FIG. 4 is a network-initiated area event triggered positioning method according to a<br>
fourth exemplary embodiment of the present invention. In the fourth exemplary<br>
embodiment of the present invention, a roaming case, a network-initiated case, an H-<br>
SLP positioning case and a case where the H-SLP uses the non-proxy mode are im-<br>
plemented. The SET (target SET) is a roaming SET which has roamed to a visited<br>
network to which the V-SLP belongs, and the H-SLP performs the positioning<br>
function.<br>
[ 129] The V-SLP includes the V-SPC and the V-SLC, and only the V-SLC is shown in<br>
FIG. 4.<br>
[130] The H-SLP includes the H-SLC and the H-SPC, and the H-SPC performs the po-<br>
sitioning function and the H-SLC uses the non-proxy mode.<br>
[131] Compared with the third exemplary embodiment of the present invention as shown in<br>
FIG. 3, in the fourth exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the H-SPC<br>
performs the positioning function.<br>
[132] Accordingly, when a positioning service request related to an area event triggered<br>
 <br>
session is received, the H-SLC of the H-SLP sends the service request to the H-SPC.<br>
The H-SPC accepts or rejects the request and provides a corresponding result to the H-<br>
SLC.<br>
[133] The SET nonce and key id 2 parameters transmitted from the SET to the H-SLC in<br>
step S34 in FIG. 3 are used to establish the security session between the V-SPC that<br>
performs the positioning function and the SET, while the SET nonce and key-id 2<br>
parameters transmitted from the SET to the H-SLC in step S65 in FIG. 4 are used to<br>
establish a security session between the H-SPC and the SET.<br>
[134] In step S65, when the SUPL TRIGGERED START message is sent from the SET,<br>
the H-SLC sends an RLP TSRLRR message to the V-SLC to request area ids cor-<br>
responding to areas for an area event triggered session (step S67).<br>
[ 1351 Then, the V-SLC sends SUPL TRIGGERED RESOPNSE message information<br>
including the area ids through an RLP TSRLRA message to the H-SLC (step S68).<br>
f 1361 The H-SLC sends the SUPL TRIGGERED RESPONSE message received form the<br>
V-SLC to the SET. The SUPL TRIGGERED RESPONSE message contains a session-<br>
ID, a posmethod, an H-SPC address and a trigger parameter (trigger_params). The H-<br>
SPC address indicates the address of the H-SPC that performs the positioning function,<br>
and the trigger parameter indicates trigger condition information related to the area<br>
event trigger for positioning.<br>
[137] For example, the trigger parameter may contain trigger condition information<br>
indicating the chang_area type of the area event and a particular area. The change_area<br>
type of the area event may indicate whether the roaming terminal is moved into the<br>
particular area, moved out of the particular area, or is located in the particular. The<br>
particular area may include at least one of the name of an administrative district, the<br>
name of an area, and latitude and longitude of a particular position.<br>
[138] The area ids or location identifiers (lids) of the specified area for the area event<br>
triggered session may be included in the SUPL TRIGGER RESPONSE message.<br>
[139] Preferably, the area ids can be information indicating a location area in the actual<br>
network such as ids of cells belonging to the area required for positioning by the SUPL<br>
agent, a mobile country code (MCC), a mobile network code (MNC) or a location area<br>
code (LAC), etc., or a primary scrambling code number. In particular, in case of the<br>
WCDMA, the area ids may correspond to the primary scrambling code number.<br>
[140] Thereafter, steps S70 to S83 are performed in the almost similar manner as the steps<br>
S41 to S51 illustrated in FIG. 3 and only the differences therebetween will now be<br>
described.<br>
[1411 In the third exemplary embodiment as shown in FIG. 3, when the positioning session<br>
start condition is met, the SET directly sends the SUPL POS INIT message to the V-<br>
SPC (step S42). Comparatively, in the fourth exemplary embodiment of the present<br>
 <br>
invention as shown in FIG. 4, when the positioning session start condition is met, the<br>
SET sends the SUPL POS INIT message to the H-SPC corresponding to the address of<br>
the H-SPC included in the SUPL TRIGGERED RESPONSE message received in step<br>
S69.<br>
[142] The V-SPC in FIG. 3 converts the current area id (lid) included in the received SUPL<br>
POS INIT message to a position estimate value. Comparatively, the H-SPC in FIG. 4 is<br>
not able to directly convert the current area id (lid) included in the received SUPL POS<br>
INIT message to a position estimate value, so the H-SPC obtains the position estimate<br>
value corresponding to the lid upon requesting it from the V-SLC in steps S72 to S75.<br>
[143] In FIG. 4, the H-SPC selectively performs the procedure for calculating the actual<br>
position of the SET (namely, the positioning procedure) according to whether the<br>
converted position estimate value satisfies the QoP or not (steps S76 and S77). The<br>
SET checks whether an area event has occurred based on the calculated position value<br>
of the SET (step S78) and sends a corresponding message to the H-SLC (step S79).<br>
[144] As stated above, in the fourth exemplary embodiment of the present invention as<br>
shown in FIG. 4, when the network initiates the positioning service and the H-SPC<br>
having the positioning function wants to check (calculate) area-based position of the<br>
roaming SET, the H-SLC obtains the area ids specified for the area event triggered<br>
session from the V-SLC and provides them to the roaming SET, and the roaming SET<br>
and the V-SPC directly set a positioning session therebetween without going through<br>
the H-SLP serving as the non-proxy and calculates the area-based position of the<br>
roaming SET.<br>
[145] As so far described, the network-initiated area event triggered positioning method for<br>
a roaming terminal in a SUPL-based location information system according to the<br>
present invention allows diverse positioning methods to be implemented based on the<br>
SUPL.<br>
[146] As the present invention may be embodied in several forms without departing from<br>
the spirit or essential characteristics thereof, it should also be understood that the<br>
above-described embodiments are not limited by any of the details of the foregoing de-<br>
scription, unless otherwise specified, but rather should be construed broadly within its<br>
