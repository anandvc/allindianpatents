MULTI-PAGE INSTANT MESSAGING METHOD AND<br>
SYSTEM<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The   present   invention   relates   to   network   application   technologies,   and particularly, to a multi-page Instant Messaging (IM) method and system.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
An IM service is an Internet-based communication service, which mainly implements IM functions on a network. Nowadays, the IM service has been widely used and approbated on the Internet, and may be implemented by an IM system. The IM system is approbated and favored by large numbers of netizens because of its rapid speed, abundant functions and stability. In an existing IM system, users can perform multiple operations between one another through the IM system, for example, exchanging word formation, transferring a document and sending a mobile phone short message.<br>
By far, IM software has developed for a long time, and has been approbated by most of netizens and has become a necessary software tool. The IM software is not only used in daily leisure and entertainment, but also widely used in work of the users. Therefore, the users have higher requirements for the usability, stability and security of the IM software. When using the IM software, a user not only needs a chat in which the user communicates with only one user, but also needs a chat in which the user may communicate with multiple other users of the IM software. For instance, colleagues in different places can not discuss a project or arrange jobs face to face; however, with a multi-person conversation function provided by the IM software, the colleagues in different places can discuss and analyze some problems conveniently.<br><br>
The IM software provides a platform by which multiple users can communicate with each other at one time. Therefore, the experience that multiple users communicate with one another at one time is satisfied.<br>
In some circumstances, the user needs to use the IM software because it can be used conveniently, but is unable to or inconvenient to install the IM software. In such a case, an IM chat can be implemented through web access, so that the user can enjoy the convenience of the IM without installing the IM software.<br>
When performing the IM chat using a first web page, the user may browse a second web page. If the user is interested in a person on the second web page and wants to chat with the person, a chat window need be invoked. If different chat windows are invoked by different web pages respectively, each chat window communicates with a server, which aggravates the burden of the server.<br>
Furthermore, in a multi-page case, the user may confound the chat windows, and frequently switch among different web pages to chat with each good friend. In such a case, the user is weighted down with such operations and can not enjoy the chat.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
An embodiment of the present invention provides a multi-page IM method, which can reduce the burden of a server.<br>
The multi-page IM method includes:<br>
setting a Token in at least two web pages; and<br>
obtaining, by a first web page possessing the Token, information of a chat partner, and performing, through interacting with an IM server, web IM with the chat partner by using the information of the chat partner.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention provides a multi-page IM system, which can reduce the burden of a server.<br><br>
A multi-page IM system includes at least two web pages and a Token determination unit, each of the at least two web pages comprises an IM interaction unit; wherein the Token determination unit is configured to allocate a Token to one of the at least two web pages; and the IM interaction unit of each of the at least two web page is configured to obtain information of a chat partner when a first web page comprising the IM interaction unit possesses the Token, and perform, through interacting with an IM server, web IM with the chat partner by using the information of the chat partner.<br>
From the technical solutions above, in embodiments of the present invention, through a Token preemption mechanism, the web page currently possessing the Token obtains the information of the chat partner and performs, through interacting with the IM server, the web IM with the chat partner by using the information of the chat partner. Thus, with the embodiments of the present invention, only one web page can communicate with the IM server at one time, which can reduces the burden of the IM server.<br>
Furthermore, after the web page currently possessing the Token is closed, through the Token delivering, another web page takes the place of the closed web page to communicate with the IM server, until all the web pages are closed. Therefore, if the chat window is closed, the user can receive the IM message as long as the user does not quit the website or the browser, which meets requirements of the user. Furthermore, any of the web pages can invoke the same chat window, which can ensure the unity of exports and provide the user with a better chat experience.<br>

Detailed description of the invention<br>
The present invention is further described in detail hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings so as to make the objective, technical solution and merits thereof more apparent.<br>
In embodiments of the present invention, all web pages opened by a website or a browser are capable of receiving or sending an IM message. However, at one time, only one of the web pages which are capable of receiving or sending the IM message, i.e. only a web page currently possessing a Token, can communicate with a server, receive and send the IM message through a Token preemption mechanism.<br>
In addition, if the web page capable of receiving and sendmg the IM message currently is closed, another web page will take the place of the previously-closed web page through Token delivering so as to conmiunicate with the server, until all the web pages are closed. Preferably, only one chat window is invoked through any of the web pages.<br>
Figure 1 is a flowchart of a multi-page IM method in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
As shown in Figure 1, the method is described below.<br>
Block 101: A Token is set for multiple web pages.<br>
Block 102: A first web page possessing the Token obtains information of a chat partner; through interacting with an IM server, the first web page performs the web<br><br>
web IM with the chat partner by using the information of the chat partner.<br>
In this Block, upon obtaining the Token, the first web page interacts with the IM server only when the IM interaction is needed. However, other ordinary web pages without the Token do not interact with the IM server.<br>
When a user triggers a chat partner in any of the multiple web pages (e.g. click a good friend or a stranger in expectation of chatting with the good friend or the stranger), information of the chat partner (usually be an IM number or an IM user name of the clicked good friend or stranger) is saved in a messaging channel which can be accessed by the web page currently possessing the Token.<br>
The first web page determines whether the IM interaction is needed through determining whether the messaging channel saves the information of the chat partner. If the messaging channel does not save the information of the chat partner, the first web page does not open a chat page (i.e. a chat window), and does not interact with the IM server. If the messaging channel saves the information of the chat partner, the first web page opens the chat page and interacts with the IM server according to the information of the chat partner.<br>
For instance, a user finds a person (may be a good friend or a stranger) whom the user wishes to chat with in any of web pages A, B and C, the user clicks a chat button, and an IM number of the person is saved into the messaging channel (e.g. saved in a TalkToUin bit). Upon obtaining the Token, web page A determines that the TalkToUin bit is not null and communicates with the IM server. However, web pages B and C do not communicate with the IM server due to lack of the Token.<br>
After detecting that the TalkToUin bit is not null, web page A possessing the Token can open a chat window in web page A. The chat window reads the TalkToUin and obtains the IM number for chatting. Preferably, the TalkToUin is cleared for writing information at next time. Preferably, the chat window is a Tab page of web<br><br>
page A.<br>
Preferably, when the first web page possessing the Token is closed by a user, the first web page delivers the Token to a second web page. Upon obtaining the Token, the second web page obtains the information of the chat partner and performs, through interacting with the IM server, the web IM with the chat partner by using the information of the chat partner.<br>
Similarly, the second web page obtaining the Token also determines whether the IM interaction is needed through determining whether the messaging channel saves the information of the chat partner.<br>
The first web page which is closed by a user can choose the second web page randomly, and deliver the Token to the second web page. Alternatively, the second web page may be pre-configured as a web page to receive the Token firstly. When the first web page currently possessing the Token is closed by a user, the first web page delivers the Token to the second web page.<br>
Furthermore, when the second web page possessing the Token is closed,	the<br>
second web page may deliver the Token to a third web page. Upon obtaining	the<br>
Token, the third web page obtains the information of the chat partner from	the<br>
messaging channel, and performs, through interacting with the IM server, the	IM<br>
interaction with the chatting partner by using the information of the chat partner.<br>
By analogy, when a web page possessing the Token is closed, the Token may be delivered all along.<br>
In the process above, the messaging channel may be located in the IM server at a network side, or a browser for opening a web page or a website.<br>
Preferably, a Token flag bit for indicating an occupation state of the Token is further saved in the messaging channel. The web page possessing the Token detects<br><br>
whether the Token flag bit is 1. If the Token flag bit is 1, the web page possessing the Token configures the Token flag bit as 0, indicating that the Token is obtained by itself, and starts to communicate with the server. If the web page possessing the Token is closed, the web page configures the Token flag bit as 1 and releases the Token before being closed.<br>
When a user changes state information of an IM user in any of the multiple web pages, the messaging channel further saves changed state information of the IM user.<br>
The web page possessing the Token sends a state changing request to the IM server according to the changed state information of the IM user in the messaging charmel, and the IM server changes the state of the IM user in response to the state charging request. Web pages which do not possess the Token currently change display state of the IM user according to the changed state information saved in the messaging charmel.<br>
For instance, it is supposed that web page A obtains the Token, and web page A can communicate with the IM server. Web pages B and C which do not possess the Token can not communicate with the IM server. When the state of the IM user in web page B is changed to an offline state, web page B records the offline state in the messaging charmel. Web pages A and C detect that the state information in the messaging charmel has been changed to the offline state, and web page C changes a display state of the IM user to the offline state while web page A sends a message to the IM server to change the state of the IM user to the offline state.<br>
If the state of the IM user is changed to the offline state in web page A, web page A sends the message to the IM server to change the state of the IM user to the offline state firstly, and then records the offline state in the messaging channel. Upon detecting that the state information in the messaging channel is changed, web pages B and C change display states of the IM user respectively.<br><br>
Briefly speaking, in embodiments of the present invention, when a chat partner is triggered in any of web pages including the first web page, the second web page until the N web page, the information of the chat partner is saved in the messaging channel. N is a natural number and is not less than 2.<br>
Upon obtaining the information of the chat partner, the web page currently possessing the Token opens a chat window located in the web page currently possessing the Token, and performs the web IM interaction with the chat partner by using the information of the chat partner. The chat window may be located in a Tab page of the web page currently possessing the Token.<br>
Figure 2 is a schematic diagram illustrating a chat interface of multi-page IM in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. As shown in Figure 2, "ibiboS" and "harryl23" on the left of the page are user names and form the Tab page, a user can chat with "ibiboS" or "harryl23"s by clicking "ibiboS" or "harryl23".<br>
Based on the descriptions above, another embodiment of the present invention provides a multi-page IM system.<br>
Figure 3 is a schematic diagram illustrating a structure of a multi-page IM system in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
As illustrated in Figure 3, the multi-page IM system includes four web pages and a Token determination unit, and each web page contains an IM interaction unit.<br>
The Token determination unit is configured to allocate a Token to one of the four web pages. The Token determination unit may randomly choose a web page and allocate the Token to the chosen web page. Alternatively, a priority level for obtaining the Token may be configured for each web page in advance; when a web page discards the Token, the Token determination unit determines which one of the other web pages has a higher priority level, and the web page having a higher priority level can obtain the Token.<br><br>
The four web pages include a first web page, a second web page, a third web page and a fourth web page. The multi-page IM system further includes a messaging channel connected to the four web pages. In this embodiment, it is supposed that the first web page possesses the Token currently.<br>
Each web page includes an IM interaction unit. The function of the IM mteraction unit in each web page is the same. Specifically, if a web page including the IM interaction unit possesses the Token, the web page obtains information of a chat partner, and performs, through interacting with an IM server, web IM with the chat partner by using the information of the chat partner. The messaging chaimel saves a Token bit, a TalkToUin bit for saving the information of the chat partner and a State bit for saving state information of an IM user.<br>
When a user triggers a chat partner (e.g. clicking a good friend or a stranger in expectation of chatting with the good friend or the stranger) in any of the four web pages, the information of the chat partner (usually be an IM number or an IM user name of the clicked good friend or stranger) is saved in the TalkToUin bit in the messaging channel.<br>
Thus, the first web page currently possessing the Token can obtain the information of the chat partner from the TalkToUin bit in the messaging chaimel, and perform, through interacting with the IM server, the web IM with the chat partner by using the information of the chat partner. However, the second web page, the third web page and the fourth web page do not interact with the IM server.<br>
When the user changes state information of the IM user in any of the four web pages, changed state information is saved in the Sate bit in the messaging channel.<br>
The first web page currently possessing the Token sends a state changing request to the IM server according to the changed state information saved in the messaging channel. The IM server changes the state of the IM user in response to the<br><br>
state changing request.<br>
Web pages which do not possess the Token currently (i.e. the second web page, the third web page and the fourth web page) change a display state of the IM user according to the changed state information saved in the messaging chaimel.<br>
In this embodiment, the first web page possesses the Token, and die first web page detects whether the Token flag bit in the messaging chaimel is 1. If the Token flag bit in the messaging channel is 1, the first web page configures the Token flag bit as 0, indicating that the Token is obtained by itself, and starts to communicate with the IM server.<br>
If the first web page possessing the Token is to be closed, the first web page configures the Token flag bit as 1, and releases the Token before being closed.<br>
If the first web page currently possessing the Token is to be closed, the first web page may deliver the Token to a next web page. For instance, the first web page randomly chooses the second web page, and delivers the Token to the second web page. Alternatively, the second web page may be pre-configured as a web page with a higher priority level for receiving the Token; if the first web page currently possessing the Token is closed, the first web page delivers the Token to the second web page.<br>
Specifically, the first web page delivers the Token to the second web page while being closed. Upon obtaining the Token, the second web page obtains the information of the chat partner from the messaging channel and performs, through interacting with the IM server, the web IM with the chat partner by using the information of the chat partner. In such a case, the second web page possesses the Token and thus performs the web IM with the chat partner by using the information of the chat partner. However, the first web page, the third web page, and the fourth web page do not interact with the IM server.<br>
Though the embodiments above merely describe the schematic diagram of the<br><br>
structure of the multi-page IM system including four web pages, it can be known to a person skilled in the art that the embodiments of the present invention are not limited to four web pages, but are applicable to any number of web pages.<br>
To sum up, in the embodiments of the present invention, through the Token preemption mechanism, the web page currently possessing the Token obtains the information of the chat partner and performs, through interacting with the IM server, the web IM with the chat partner by using the information of the chat partner. Thus, only one web page can communicate with the IM server at one time, which can reduces the burden of the IM server.<br>
Furthermore, after the web page currently possessing the Token is closed, by way of delivering the Token, another web page will take the place of the previous web page to communicate with the IM server, until all the web pages are closed. Therefore, upon closing a chat window, the user can receive the IM message as long as the user does not quit the website or the browser, which meets requirements of the user.<br>
According to an embodiment of the present invention, a chat window may be a particular web page which has a highest priority level to preempt the Token. When the chat window is opened, the chat window possesses the Token. For example, it is supposed that web pages A, B and C are opened, and web page A currently possesses the Token. If a user invokes a chat window by clicking a stranger on web page A, the chat window is opened and shown to the user. The user can thus chat with the stranger on the chat window, and the chat window interacts with the server. In this case, because the chat window has the highest priority level, the Token is delivered from web page A to the chat window. And thus, none of web pages A, B and C has the Token or has the priority to interact with the server. If the user finds a second stranger on web page B, the user may click the IM number or IM user name of the second stranger in order to chat with the second stranger, and the IM number or IM user name of the second stranger is saved by web page B into the messaging charmel; at this point, the chat window detect the IM number or IM user name of the second<br><br>
stranger, and is shown to the user so that the user can chat with the second stranger on the chat window. Therefore, only one chat window is opened, and the user can chat with multiple good friends or strangers without switching between different chat windows. In other words, any of the web pages can invoke the same chat window, which ensures the unity of exports and provides the user with a better chat experience.<br>
