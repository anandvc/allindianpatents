The above coupling and cyanation reactions may be carried out under various conditions and in the presence of solvents and other reagents as required, including catalysts and co-factors as known in the art and for instance, as hereinafter described in the examples.<br>
The starting materials may be prepared and the coupled and cyclised products may be converted into other compounds of formula III and salts and esters thereof using methods and procedures known in the art, and as hereinafter described in the examples.<br><br><br><br>
Compounda of formula I, II and III as defined above and the compounds of the Examples are hereinafter referred to as Compounds of the Invention.<br>
Compounds of the invention are either obtained in the free form, or as a salt thereof if salt forming groups are present.<br>
Compounds of the Invention having basic groups can be converted into acid addition salts, especially pharmaceutically acceptable salts. These are formed, for example, with inorganic acids, such as mineral acids, for example sulfuric acid, a phosphoric or hydrohalic acid, or with organic carboxylic acids, such as (Ci-C4)alkanecarboxylic acids which, for example, are unsubstituted or substituted by halogen, for example acetic acid, such as saturated or unsaturated dicarboxylic acids, for example oxalic, succinic, maleic or fumaric acid, such as hydroxycarboxylic acids, for example glycolic, lactic, malic, tartaric or citric acid, such as amino acids, for example aspartic or glutamic acid, or with organic sulfonic acids, such as (C1-C4-alkylsulfonic<br><br>

In view of the close relationship between the free compounds and the compounds in the form of their salts, whenever a compound is referred to in this context, a corresponding salt is also intended, provided such is possible or appropriate under the circumstances.<br>
The compounds, including their salts, can also be obtained in the form of their hydrates, or include other solvents used for their crystallization.<br>
The compounds of the invention exhibit valuable pharmacological properties in mammals and are particularly useful as inhibitors of cathepsin K.<br>
The cathepsin K inhibitory effects of the compound of the invention can be demonstrated in vitro by measuring the inhibition of e.g. recombinant human cathepsin K.<br>
The in vitro assay is carried out as follows:<br>
For cathepsin K:<br>
The assay is performed in 96 well microliter plates at ambient temperature using recombinant human cathepsin K. Inhibition of cathepsin K is assayed at a constant enzyme (0.16 nM) and substrate concentration (54 mM Z-Phe-Arg-AMCA - Peptide Institute Inc. Osaka, Japan) in 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 2 mM dithiothreitol, 20 mM Tween 80 and 1 mM EDTA. Cathepsin K is preincubated with the inhibitors for 30 min, and the reaction is initiated by the addition of substrate. After 30 min incubation the reaction is stopped by the addition of E-64 (2 mM), and fluorescence intensity is read on a multi-well plate reader at excitation and emission wavelengths of 360 and 460 nm, respectively. Compounds of the Invention typically have IC50S for inhibition of human cathepsin K of less than about lOOnM down to about InM or less, preferably of about 5nM or less, e.g. about InM. Thus for example, the compounds of Examples 1-22 and 1-23 have IC50S for inhibition of human cathepsin K of 3nM and 1.5 nM respectively.<br><br>
In view of their activity as inhibitors of cathepsin K, Compounds of the Invention are particularly useful in mammals as agents for treatment and prophylaxis of diseases and medical conditions involving elevated levels of cathepsin K. Such diseases include diseases involving infection by organisms such as Pneumocystis carinii, trypsanoma cruzi, trypsanoma brucei, crithidia fusiculata, as well as parasitic diseases such as schistosomiasis and malaria, tumours (tumour invasion and tumour metastasis), and other diseases such as metachromatic leukodystrophy, muscular dystrophy, amytrophy and similar diseases.<br>
Cathepsin K, has been implicated in diseases of excessive bone loss, and thus the Compounds of the Invention may be used for treatment and prophylaxis of such diseases, including osteoporosis, gingival diseases such as gingivitis and periodontitis, Paget's disease, hypercalcemia of malignancy, e.g. tumour-induced hypercalcemia and metabolic bone disease.

Beneficial effects are evaluated in in vitro and in vivo pharmacological tests generally known in the art, and as illustrated herein.<br>
The above cited properties are demonstrable in in vitro and in vivo tests, using advantageously mammals, e.g. rats, mice, dogs, rabbits, monkeys or isolated organs and tissues, as well as mammalian enzyme preparations, either natural or prepared by e.g. recombinant technology. Compounds of the Invention can be applied in vitro in the form of solutions, e.g. preferably aqueous solutions or suspensions, and in vivo either enterally<br><br>
or parenterally, advantageously orally, e.g. as a suspension or in aqueous solution, or as a solid capsule or tablet formulation. The dosage in vitro may range between about 10"5 molar and 10"9 molar concentrations. The dosage in vivo may range, depending on the route of administration, between about 0.1 and 100 mg/kg.<br>
The antiarthritic efficacy of the Compounds of the Invention for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis can be determined using models such as or similar to the rat model of adjuvant arthritis, as described previously (R.E. Esser, et. al. J. Rheumatology, 1993, 20, 1176.)<br>
