This invention relates to a supported catalyst component comprising a support material, an organometal compound, and an activator compound, to a supported catalyst comprising said supported catalyst component and a transition metal compound, to a process for preparing such a supported catalyst component and catalyst, to a polymerization process using such a supported catalyst, to complex compounds for use as activator compounds, and to a process for making such complex compounds.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Homogeneous or non-supported ionic transition metal catalysts are known for their high catalytic activity in olefin polymerizations.  Under polymerization conditions where polymer is formed as solid particles, these homogeneous (soluble) catalysts form polymer deposits on reactor walls and stirrers which deposits should be removed frequently as they prevent an efficient heat-exchange necessary for cooling the reactor contents and cause excessive wear of the moving parts in the reactor.  The polymers produced by these soluble catalysts further have a low bulk density which limits the commercial utility of both the polymer and the process.  In order to solve these problems, several supported ionic catalysts have been proposed for use in particle forming polymerization processes.<br>
WO-91/09882 describes a supported ionic metallocene catalyst prepared by combining  a<br><br><br>
bis(cyclopentadienyl) metal compound containing at least one ligand capable of reacting with a proton, ii) an activator component comprising a cation capable of donating a proton and a bulky, labile anion capable of stabilizing the metal cation formed as a result of reaction between the metal compound and the activator component, and iii) a catalyst support material.  The support material may be subjected to a thermal or chemical dehydration treatment.  In some of the examples triethylaluminum was added for this purpose.  The maximum bulk density reported in the examples of W091/09882 is 0.17 g/cm3 and the catalyst efficiency is not satisfactory.<br>
WO-94/03506 describes a supported ionic catalyst prepared by combining i) a monocyclopentadienyl metal compound, ii) an activator component comprising a cation which will irreversibly react with at least one ligand contained in said metal compound and an anion, said anion being a chemically stable non-nucleophilic anionic complex, and iii) a catalyst support material, optionally followed by prepolymerizing said supported catalyst system with an olefinic monomer. The support material may be treated with a hydrolyzable organoadditive, preferably a Group 13 alkyl compound such as triethylaluminum. The catalyst efficiencies obtained in WO-94/03506, however, are very low. WO-94/03509 suggests the use of supported ionic catalysts such as described in WO-94/035G6 for use in a gas phase polymerization process.<br>
WO-93/21238 discloses trisCpentafluorophenyDborane complexes of water, alcohols, mercaptans, silanols, oximes, and mixtures thereof.  These neutral complexes may be converted to<br>
42,173A-F<br><br>
acidic salts of their conjugate bases by reaction with amines. These complexes and acidic salts thereof together with Group 4 transition metal compounds, especially metallocenes, were disclosed as being useful as homogeneous olefin pol)mierization catalysts.<br>
WO-93/11172 relates to polyionic transition metal catalyst compositions.  It is suggested that polyanionic activators are used to prepare a catalyst system of enhanced performance by immobilizing the catalyst on a support material.  It is believed, however, that the teachings in WO-93/11172 do not suffice for preparing a supported catalyst based on surface-hydroxyl groups containing support materials. Figure 1, Formula 3 and page 26, line 25 suggest so-called alcohol-functionalized synthons to be used in making the polyanionic activators.  Several methods are suggested to make catalyst supports based on polyanionic activators made from alcohol-functionalized synthons, as discussed below.  In a first method (page 26, line 32-36 and Fig. 1 Formula 6) the alcohol functionalized synthon is converted into silylhalide analogs by treatment with R'jSiCl4-j (j = 0 to 3). As indicated therein, HCl is liberated which should be adsorbed by a tertiary amine. This, however, will give the by-product R3NH.CI.  The ammonium chloride thus formed is not a suitable activator compound for a transition metal catalyst because the chloride anion is not a non-coordinating anion which is typically required for such type of catalyst, and the catalyst thus made will not have substantial catalyst activity.  The compound of Formula 6 may be reacted with a hydroxylated substrate such as silica gel, alumina or metal oxides (page 34, lines 25-28 and Figure 1 route C).  When using the compound of<br>
M2,173A-F<br><br>
Formula 6 equivalents of HCl may be liberated, which compound and the possibly suggested by-product ammonium chloride will provide catalyst systems having only insignificant catalytic activities.<br>
On page 32, lines 11-18 further methods are suggested for making catalyst supports from the alcohol-functionalized synthons: acid catalyzed dehydration of hydroxylated surfaces (such as amorphous silica), and esterification or transesterification of discrete or polymeric materials containing more than one carboxylic acid or ester per molecule, polymer chain or particle. All such reactions liberate water, which is a poison for transition metal catalysts.<br>
A further method is described on page 34, line 34 to page 35, line 37 and page 37, line 16 to page 38, line 14, as well as in Figure 8.  According to that method, a support material is provided with anionic functionalities by reacting a silane halide or silane alkoxide coupling agent with a hydroxylated surface of silica. On page 35, lines 33-37 it is suggested to mask or protect reactive functionalities such as hydroxyl functions (on the silica). On page 37, lines 20-31 this is further explained and it is indicated that part of the hydroxyl functions can be masked and the remaining part can be converted into said anionic functionalities. This would enable varying or adjusting the concentration of (ultimately) anionic functionalities.  A mixture of bromophenyl silane trimethoxy and phenylsilane trimethoxy is mentioned in this context.  Accordingly, the hydroxyl functionalities which are masked or protected are not used for preparing anionic functionalities.  Besides, using silane halides or silane alkoxides to react with surface hydroxyl groups<br>
i|2,173A-F<br><br>
would give as by-product hydrogen halides and alcohols which are catalyst poisons. Accordingly, none of the suggested methods are believed to give effective supported catalysts.<br>
It would be desirable to provide a supported catalyst and supported catalyst component thereof, and a polymerization process that is capable of producing polymers at good catalyst efficiencies, thereby avoiding or reducing some of the disadvantages occurring in the prior art.<br>

Detailed description of the invention<br>
All references herein to elements or metals belonging to a certain Group refer to the Periodic Table of the Elements published and copyrighted by CRC Press, Inc., 1989.  Also any reference to the Group or Groups shall be to the Group or Groups as reflected in this Periodic Table of the Elements using the lUPAC system for numbering groups.<br>
Surprisingly, it has been found that a complex compound that contains at least one substituent comprising an active hydrogen moiety as specified herein, can be attached to the support and is capable of activating transition metal catalysts typically employed in addition polymerization processes.  This is surprising, as it is known, that active hydrogen-containing compounds tend to deactivate typical transition metal catalysts, especially those transition metal catalysts containing a cyclopentadienyl moiety or a derivative thereof.  The present supported catalysts<br>
i42,173A-F<br><br>
can be employed to produce polymers at satisfactory catalyst efficiencies.<br>
An additional benefit is that the formation of polymer deposits at reactor walls and other moving parts in the reactor is avoided; and the polymers are in the form of free flowing powder or particles, when a particle forming poljmierization process, such as a slurry or gas phase pol3mierization process, is employed so that the polymers can be easily transported, and that polymers of improved bulk density are obtained in such particle forming polymerization processes.  According to the present invention improved bulk densities, for ethylene based polymers and interpolymers, are preferably bulk densities of at least about 0.20 g/cm3, and more preferably of at least about 0.25 g/cm3.  In the supported catalyst components and catalysts, the activating complexes are well dispersed throughout the pore structure of the porous support material, which is one of the important factors for maintaining both an extended period and a high level of catalyst efficiency. During the formation of polymer on the supported catalyst particles, the particles tend to fragment and thus make fresh surface available for polymer growth. The presence of catalytically active groups on such fresh surface is very desirable for providing good catalyst efficiencies and poljmier morphology.<br>
Suitable support materials for use in the present invention include porous resinous materials, for example, polyolefins such as polyethylenes and polypropylenes or copolymers of styrene-divinylbenzene, and solid inorganic oxides including oxides of Group 2, 3, 4, 13, or 14 metals, such as silica, alumina, magnesium oxide, titanium oxide, thorium oxide, as well<br>
42,173A-F<br><br>
as mixed oxides of silica.  Suitable mixed oxides of silica include those of silica and one or more Group 2 or 13 metal oxides, such as silica-magnesia or silica-alumina mixed oxides.  Silica, alumina, and mixed oxides of silica and one or more Group 2 or 13 metal oxides are preferred support materials.  Preferred examples of such mixed oxides are the silica-aluminas.  The most preferred support material is silica.  The shape of the silica particles is not critical and the silica may be in granular, spherical, agglomerated, fumed or other form.  Suitable silicas include those that are available from Grace Davison (division of W.R. Grace &amp; Co.) under the designations SD 3216.30, SP-9-10046, Davison Syloid 245, Davison 948 and Davison 952, from Degussa AG under the designation Aerosil 812, and from Crossfield under the designation ES 70X.<br>
Support materials suitable for the present invention preferably have a surface area as determined by nitrogen porosimetry using the B.E.T. method from 10 to about 1000 m2/g, and preferably from about 100 to 600 m2/g.  The pore volume of the support, as determined by nitrogen adsorption, is typically up to 5 cm3/g, advantageously between 0.1 and 3 cm3/g, preferably from about 0.2 to 2 cm3/g. The average particle size is not critical but typically is from 0.5 to 500 pm, preferably from 1 to 200 ptm, more preferably to 100 \m.<br>
The support material may be subjected to a heat treatment and/or chemical treatment to reduce the water content or the hydroxyl content of the support material. Both dehydrated support materials and support materials containing small amounts of water can be used. Typical thermal pretreatments are carried out at a temperature from 30'C to 1000°C for a duration of 10 minutes to 50<br>
i|2,173A-F<br><br>
hours in an inert atmosphere or under reduced pressure. Typical support materials have a surface hydroxyl content of from 0.1 micromol, preferably from 5 micromol, more preferably from 0.05 mmol to not more than 5 mmol hydroxyl groups per g of solid support, more preferably from 0.5 to 2 mmol per gram.  The hydroxyl content can be determined by known techniques, such as infrared spectroscopy and titration techniques using a metal alkyl or metal hydroxide, for example, adding an excess of dialkyl magnesium to a slurry of the solid support and determining the amount of dialkyl magnesium remaining in solution via known techniques.  This latter method is based on the reaction of S-OH + MgR2 -*■  S-QMgR + RH, wherein S is the solid support.<br>
The support material is treated with the organometal compound.  Suitable organometal compounds are those comprising metals of Groups 2-13, germanium, tin, and lead, and at least two substituents selected from hydride, hydrocarbyl radicals, trihydrocarbyl silyl radicals, and trihydrocarbyl germyl radicals. Additional substituents preferably comprise one or more substituents selected from hydride, hydrocarbyl radicals, trihydrocarbyl substituted silyl radicals, trihydrocarbyl substituted germyl radicals, and hydrocarbyl-, trihydrocarbyl silyl- or trihydrocarbyl germyl-substituted metalloid radicals.<br>
The recitation "metalloid", as used herein, includes non-metals such as boron, phosphorus and the like which exhibit semi-metallic characteristics.<br>
Examples of such organometal compounds include organomagnesium, organozinc, organoboron, organoaluminum, organogermanium, organotin, and<br>
42,173A-F<br><br>
organolead compounds, and mixtures thereof.  Further suitable organometal compounds are alumoxanes. Preferred examples are alumoxanes and compounds represented by the following formulae:  MgR^2&gt; ZnR-'-2, BR^xR^yj AlR^xR^yj wherein Rl independently each occurrence is hydride, a hydrocarbyl radical, a trihydrocarbyl silyl radical, a trihydrocarbyl germyl radical, or a trihydrocarbyl-, trihydrocarbyl silyl-, or trihydrocarbyl germyl-substituted metalloid radical, R2 independently is the same as R^, x is 2 or 3, y is 0 or 1 and the sum of x and y is 3, and mixtures thereof. Examples of suitable hydrocarbyl moieties are those having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms in the hydrocarbyl portion thereof, such as alkyl, aryl, alkaryl, or aralkyl.  Preferred radicals include methyl, ethyl, n- or i-propyl, n-, s- or t-butyl, phenyl, and benzyl. Preferably, the aluminum component is selected from the group consisting of alumoxane and aluminum compounds of the formula AlRlx wherein Rl in each occurrence independently is hydride or a hydrocarbyl radical having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, and x is 3.  Suitable trihydrocarbyl aluminum compounds are trialkyl or triaryl aluminum compounds wherein each alkyl or aryl group has from 1 to 10 carbon atoms, or mixtures thereof, and preferably trialkyl aluminum compounds such as trimethyl, triethyl, tri-isobutyl aluminum.<br>
Alumoxanes (also referred to as aluminoxanes) are oligomeric or poljmieric aluminum oxy compounds containing chains of alternating aluminum and oxygen atoms, whereby the aluminum carries a substituent, preferably an alkyl group.  The structure of alumoxane is believed to be represented by the following general formulae (-Al(R)-0)ni, for a cyclic alumoxane, and<br>
i|2,173A-F<br><br>
R2Al-0(-Al(R)-0)n,-AlR2, for a linear compound, wherein R independently in each occurrence is a Ci-Cio hydrocarbyl, preferably alkyl, or halide and m is an integer ranging from 1 to about 50, preferably at least about 4.  Alumoxanes are typically the reaction products of water and an aluminum alkyl, which in addition to an alkyl group may contain halide or alkoxide groups. Reacting several different aluminum alkyl compounds, such as, for example, trimethyl aluminum and tri-isobutyl aluminum, with water yields so-called modified or mixed alumoxanes.  Preferred alumoxanes are methylalumoxane and methylalumoxane modified with minor amounts of other lower alkyl groups such as isobutyl. Alumoxanes generally contain minor to substantial amounts of starting aluminum alkyl compound.<br>
The way in which the alumoxane is prepared is not critical.  When prepared by the reaction between water and aluminum alkyl, the water may be combined with the aluminum alkyl in various forms, such as liquid, vapor, or solid, for example in the form of crystallization water.  Particular techniques for the preparation of alumoxane type compounds by contacting an aluminum alkyl compound with an inorganic salt containing water of crystallization are disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,542,199.  In a particular preferred embodiment an aluminum alkyl compound is contacted with a regeneratable water-containing substance such as hydrated alumina, silica or other substance.  This is disclosed in European Patent Application No. 338,044.<br>
The supported catalyst component and supported catalyst of the present invention generally comprise a support material combined or treated with the organometal compound, preferably an aluminum component,<br>
M2,173A-F<br><br>
and containing at least 0.1 micromol of organometal compound per g of support material, typically at least 5 micromole per g support material, advantageously at least 0.5 weight percent of the metal, preferably aluminum, expressed in gram of metal, preferably aluminum, atoms per g of support material.  Preferably, the amount of metal, advantageously aluminum, is at least 2 weight percent, and generally not more than 40 weight percent, and more preferably not more than 30 weight percent. At too high amounts of metal, preferably aluminum, the supported catalyst becomes expensive.  At too low amounts the catalyst efficiency goes down to drop below acceptable levels.<br>
The supported catalyst component and supported catalyst of the present invention preferably contain a treated support material (a) comprising a support material and an alumoxane wherein not more than about 10 percent aluminum present in the treated support material is extractable in a one hour extraction with toluene of 90°C using about 10 mL toluene per gram of pretreated support material.  More preferably, not more than about 9 percent aluminum present in the supported catalyst component is extractable, and most preferably not more than about 8 percent.  This is especially advantageous when the supported catalyst component or catalyst prepared therefrom is used in a polymerization process where a diluent or solvent is used which may extract non-fixed alumoxane from the support material.  It has been found that when the amount of extractables is below the levels given above, the amount of alumoxane that can diffuse into the polymerization solvent or diluent, if used, is so low that no appreciable amount of poljnner will be formed in the diluent, as compared to polymer<br>
n2,173A-F<br><br>
formed on the support material.  If too much polymer is formed in the diluent the polymer bulk density will decrease below acceptable levels and reactor fouling problems may occur.<br>
The toluene extraction test is carried out as follows:  About 1 g of supported catalyst component or supported catalyst, with a known aluminum content, is added to 10 mL toluene and the mixture is then heated to 90°C under an inert atmosphere.  The suspension is stirred well at this temperature for 1 hour.  Then the suspension is filtered applying reduced pressure to assist in the filtration step.  The solids are washed twice with about 3 to 5 mL toluene of 90"C per gram of solids.  The solids are then dried at 120°C for 1 hour, and subsequently the aluminum content of the solids is measured.  The difference between the initial aluminum content and the aluminum content after the extraction divided by the initial aluminum content and multiplied by 100%, gives the amount of extractable aluminum.<br>
The aluminum content can be determined by slurrying about 0.5 g of supported catalyst component or supported catalyst in 10 mL hexane.  The slurry is treated with 10 to 15 mL 6N sulfuric acid, followed by addition of a known excess of EDTA.  The excess amount of EDTA is then back-titrated with zinc chloride.<br>
Without wishing to be bound by any theory, it is believed that the activator compound used in the present invention reacts with the organometal compound, preferably aluminum component, through the active hydrogen-containing substituent.  It is believed that a group R^ of the organometal compound, preferably aluminum component, combines with the active hydrogen<br>
M2,173A-F<br><br>
moiety of the activator compound to release a neutral organic compound, for example an alkane, or hydrogen gas thereby chemically coupling the metal, preferably aluminum atom with the activator compound residue.

42,173A-F<br><br>
order of addition is not critical.  The organometal compound may be either first combined with the support material or with the activator compound, and subsequently the activator compound or the support material may be added.  One preferred embodiment comprises treating the support material first with the organometal compound, preferably aluminum component by combining the organometal compound in a suitable solvent, such as a hydrocarbon solvent, with the support material.  The temperature, pressure, and contact time for this treatment are not critical, but generally vary from -20°C to about 150°C, from subatmospheric to 10 bar, more preferably at atmospheric pressure, for 5 minutes to 48 hours.  Usually the slurry is agitated. After this treatment the solids are typically separated from the solvent. Any excess of organometal compound could then be removed by techniques known in the art. This method is especially suitable for obtaining support material with relatively low metal, preferably aluminum, loadings.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the support material is first subjected to a thermal treatment at 100°C to 1000°C, preferably at about 200°C to about 850°C.  Typically, this treatment is carried out for about 10 minutes to about 72 hours, preferably from about 0.5 hours to 24 hours.  Then the thermally treated support material is combined with the organometal compound, preferably AIR'3 wherein R' has the meaning defined hereinbefore in a suitable diluent or solvent, preferably one in which the organometal compound is soluble.  Typical solvents are hydrocarbon solvents having from 5 to 12 carbon atoms, preferably aromatic solvents such as toluene and xylenes, or<br>
42,173A-F<br><br>
aliphatic solvents of 6 to 10 carbon atoms, such as hexane, heptane, octane, nonane, decane, and isomers thereof, cycloaliphatic solvents of 6 to 12 carbon atoms such as cyclohexane, or mixtures of any of these.<br>
The support material is combined with the organometal compound at a temperature of -20°C to 150°C, preferably at 20°C to 100°C.  The contact time is not critical and can vary from 5 minutes to 72 hours, and is preferably from 0.5 hours to 36 hours.  Agitation is preferably applied.  The thus treated support material is then preferably contacted with the activator compound.<br>
An alternative treatment of the support material, suitable for obtaining alumoxane loadings attached to the support material, involves one or both of the following steps A and B:<br>
A.	heating a support material containing<br>
alumoxane under an inert atmosphere for a period and at<br>
a temperature sufficient to fix alumoxane to the support<br>
material;<br>
B.	subjecting the support material containing<br>
alumoxane to one or more wash steps to remove alumoxane<br>
not fixed to the support material;<br>
thereby selecting the conditions in heating step A and washing step B so as to form a treated support material wherein not more than about 10 percent aluminum present in the treated support material cis extractable in a one hour extraction with toluene of 90°C using about 10 mL toluene per gram of supported catalyst component.  High amounts of alumoxane attached to the support material are obtained using first heating step A., optionally followed by wash step B.<br>
42,173A-F<br><br>
In this process the alumoxane treated support material may be obtained by combining in a diluent an alumoxane with a support material containing from zero to not more than 20 vzeight percent of water, preferably from zero to not more than 6 weight percent of water, based on the total weight of support material and water. Although support materials containing substantially no water give good results with respect to catalytic properties of the supported catalyst, it has been found that support materials containing relatively small amounts of water can be used without problem in the present process.  The water containing support materials when combined under identical conditions with the same amount of alumoxane gives in the present process a supported catalyst component having a slightly higher aluminum content than the substantially water-free support material.  It is believed that the water reacts with the residual amounts of aluminum alkyl present in the alumoxane to convert the aluminum alkyl to extra alumoxane. An additional advantage is that in this way less aluminum alkyl will be lost to waste or recycle streams.  The alumoxane desirably is used in a dissolved form.<br>
Alternatively, the alumoxane pretreated support material may be obtained by combining in a diluent, a support material containing from 0.5 to 50 weight percent water, preferably from 1 to 20 weight percent water, based on the total weight of support material and water, with a compound of the formula R"n*AlX"3_n* wherein R" in independently each occurrence is a hydrocarbyl radical, X" is halogen or hydrocarbyloxy, and n* is an integer from 1 to 3.  Preferably, n* is 3. R" in independently each occurrence is preferably an<br>
M2,173A-F<br><br>
alkyl radical, advantageously one containing from 1 to 12 carbon atoms.  Preferred alkyl radicals are methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, tert-butyl, pentyl, iso-pentyl, hexyl, iso-hexyl, heptyl, octyl, and cyclohexyl.  Highly preferred compounds of fotmula R"n*AlX"3-n* are trimethylaluminum, triethylaluminum and tri-isobutylaluminum.  When the alumoxane is prepared in situ  by reacting the compound of the formula R"n*AlX"3_n* with water, the mole ratio of R"n*AlX"3_n* to water is typically 10:1 to 1:1, preferably from 5:1 to 1:1.<br>
The support material is added to the alumoxane or compound of the formula R"n*AlX"3-n*, preferably dissolved in a solvent, most preferably a hydrocarbon solvent, or the solution of alumoxane or compound of the formula R"n*AlX"3-n* is added to the support material. The support material can be used as such in dry form or slurried in a hydrocarbon diluent.  Both aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons can be used.  Suitable aliphatic hydrocarbons include, for example, pentane, isopentane, hexane, heptane, octane, iso-octane, nonane, isononane, decane, cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane and combinations of two or more of such diluents.  Suitable examples of aromatic diluents are benzene, toluene, xylene, and other alkyl or halogen-substituted aromatic compounds. Most preferably, the diluent is an aromatic hydrocarbon, especially toluene.  Suitable concentrations of solid support in the hydrocarbon medium range from about 0.1 to about 15, preferably from about 0.5 to about 10, more preferably from about 1 to about 7 weight percent.  The contact time and temperature are not critical. Preferably the temperature is from 0°C to 60°C, more<br>
n2,173A-F<br><br>
preferably from 10°G to 40°C.  The contact time is from 15 minutes to 40 hours, preferably from 1 to 20 hours.<br>
Before subjecting the alumoxane-treated support material to the heating step or washing step, the diluent or solvent is preferably removed to obtain a free flowing powder.  This is preferably done by applying a technique which only removes the liquid and leaves the aluminum compounds on the solids, such as by applying heat, reduced pressure, evaporation, or a combination thereof.  If desired, the removal of diluent can be combined with the heating step, although care should be taken that the diluent is removed gradually.<br>
The heating step and/or the washing step are conducted in such a way that a very large proportion (more than about 90 percent by weight) of the alumoxane which remains on the support material is fixed. Preferably, a heating step is used, more preferably a heating step is used followed by a washing step.  When used in the preferred combination both steps cooperate such that in the heating step the alumoxane is fixed to the support material, whereas in the washing step the alumoxane which is not fixed is removed to a substantial degree.  The upper temperature for the heat-treatment is preferably below the temperature at which the support material begins to agglomerate and form lumps which are difficult to redisperse, and below the alumoxane decomposition temperature.  When the transition metal compound c) is added before the heat treatment, the heating temperature should be below the decomposition temperature of the transition metal compound. Preferably, the heat-treatment is carried out at a temperature from 75°C to 250°C for a period from 15 minutes to 24 hours. More preferably, the heat<br>
M2,173A-F<br><br>
treatment is carried out at a temperature from 160°C to 200°C for a period from 30 minutes to 4 hours.  Good results have been obtained while heating for 8 hours at 100°C as well as while heating for 2 hours at 175°C.  By means of preliminary experiments, a person skilled in the art will be able to define the heat-treatment conditions that will provide the desired result.  It is also noted, that the longer the heat treatment takes, the higher the amount of alumoxane fixed to the support material will be. The heat-treatment is carried out at reduced pressure or under an inert atmosphere, such as nitrogen gas, or both but preferably at reduced pressure.  Depending on the conditions in the heating step, the alumoxane may be fixed to the support material to such a high degree that a wash step may be omitted.<br>
In the wash step, the number of washes and the solvent used are such that sufficient amounts of non-fixed alumoxane are removed. The washing conditions should be such that non-fixed alumoxane is soluble in the wash solvent. The support material containing alumoxane, preferably already subjected to a heat-treatment, is preferably subjected to one to five wash steps using an aromatic hydrocarbon solvent at a temperature from 0°C to 110°C. More preferably, the temperature is from 20°C to 100°C. Preferred examples of aromatic solvents include toluene, benzene and xylenes.  More preferably, the aromatic hydrocarbon solvent is toluene. At the end of the wash treatment, the solvent is removed by a technique that also removes the alumoxane dissolved in the solvent, such as by filtration or decantation.  Preferably, the wash solvent is removed to provide a free flowing powder.<br>
M2,173A-F<br><br>
The organotnetal compound treated support material is then typically reslurried in a suitable diluent and combined with the activator compound.  The activator compound is preferably used in a diluent. Suitable diluents include hydrocarbon and halogenated hydrocarbon diluents.  Any type of solvent or diluent can be used which does not react with the catalyst components in such a way as to negatively impact the catalytic properties.  Preferred diluents are aromatic hydrocarbons, such as toluene, benzene, and xylenes, and aliphatic hydrocarbons such as hexane, heptane, and cyclohexane.  Preferred halogenated hydrocarbons include methylene chloride and carbon tetrachloride.  The temperature is not critical but generally varies between -20°C and the decomposition temperature of the activator.  Typical contact times vary from a few minutes to several days. Agitation of the reaction mixture is preferred. Advantageously, the activator compound is dissolved, using heat to assist in dissolution where desired.  It may be desirable to carry out the contacting between the organometal-treated support material and the activator compound at elevated temperatures.  Preferably, such elevated temperatures are from 45°C to 120°C.<br>
Instead of first treating the support material with the organometal compound, preferably aluminum component, and subsequently adding the activator compound, the organometal compound, preferably aluminum component, and activator compound may be combined in a suitable diluent prior to adding or combining the reaction mixture to or with the support material.<br>
Without wishing to be bound by any theory, it is believed that an organo group of the organometal<br>
M2,173A-F<br><br>
compound reacts with the active hydrogen moiety contained in the activator anion b.2) to form a reaction product (hereinafter also referred to as "adduct").  For example, when the organometal compound is trialkylaluminum AIR3 and the active hydrogen-containing moiety is represented by G-OH, the reaction product is believed to comprise G-O-AIR2 whereas further an alkane by-product RH is formed.  This adduct G-O-AIR2 when combined with the support material containing hydroxyl groups, Si-OH in case of a silica support material, is believed to form Si-0-Al(R)-0-G together with alkane RH as by-product.  This method of preparing the supported catalyst component has been found to run very smoothly and to provide catalysts and catalyst precursors or components having desirable properties.  Typical ratios to be used in this reaction are from about 1:1 to about 20:1 moles of organometal compound to mole equivalents of active hydrogen moieties contained in the activator anion b.2).<br>
The amount of adduct, formed by combining the organometal compound with the activator compound, to be combined with the support material is not critical. Preferably, the amount is not higher than can be fixed to the support material. Typically, this is determined by the amount of support material hydroxyls.  The amount of adduct to be employed is preferably not more than the equivalent amount of such hydroxyl groups.  Less than the equivalent amount is preferably used, more preferably the ratio between moles of adduct to moles of surface reactive groups such as hydroxyls is between 0.01 and 1, even more preferably between 0.02 and 0.8. Prior to adding the transition metal compound it is preferred, especially when less than an equivalent<br>
n2,173A-F<br><br>
amount of adduct is added with respect to surface reactive groups, to add an additional amount of organometal compound to the reaction product of support material and the adduct to remove any remaining surface reactive groups which otherwise may react with the transition metal and thus require higher amounts thereof to achieve equal catalytic activity.  Prior to combining it with the transition metal compound,  the supported catalyst component can be washed, if desired, to remove any excess of adduct or organometal compound.<br>
The supported catalyst component comprising the support material, organometal compound, and the activator may be isolated to obtain a free flowing powder by removing the liquid medium using preferably filtration or evaporation techniques.<br>
Although the transition metal compound may be combined with the activator compound, or the adduct of the organometal compound and the activator compound, prior to combining the activator compound or its adduct with the support material, this results in reduced catalyst efficiencies.  Preferably, the transition metal is first combined with the support material treated with the organometal component and before adding the activator compound, or the transition metal is added after the treated support material and activator have been combined, or after the activator adduct and the support material have been combined.  Most preferably, the transition metal compound (c) is added to the reaction product of the support material treated with the organometal compound and activator compound, or after the activator adduct and the support material have been combined.<br>
42,173A-F<br><br>
The transition metal compound is preferably used dissolved in a suitable solvent, such as a hydrocarbon solvent, advantageously a C5-10 aliphatic or cycloaliphatic hydrocarbon or a C6-10 aromatic hydrocarbon.  The contact temperature is not critical provided it is below the decomposition temperature of the transition metal and of the activator. Good results are obtained in a temperature range of 0°C to 100°C. All steps in the present process should be conducted in the absence of oxygen and moisture.<br>
Upon combining the transition metal compound with the supported catalyst component, the supernatant liquid typically is colorless indicating that the transition metal compound, which solution typically is colored, substantially remains with the solid supported catalyst.<br>
The supported catalyst obtained by combining the support material, the organometal compound, the activator, and the transition metal may be stored or shipped in free flowing form under inert conditions after removal of the solvent.<br>
The supported catalysts of the present invention may be used in an addition polymerization process wherein one or more addition polymerizable monomers are contacted with the supported catalyst of the invention under addition polymerization conditions.<br>
Suitable addition pol3niierizable monomers include ethylenically unsaturated monomers, acetylenic compounds, conjugated or non-conjugated dienes, polyenes, and carbon monoxide.  Preferred monomers include olefins, for examples alpha-olefins having from<br>
M2,173A-F<br><br>
2 to about 20, preferably from about 2 to about 12, more preferably from about 2 to about 8 carbon atoms and combinations of two or more of such alpha-olefins. Particularly suitable alpha-olefins include, for example, ethylene, propylene, 1-butene, 1-pentene, 4-methylpentene-l, 1-hexene, 1-heptene, 1-octene, 1-nonene, 1-decene, 1-undecene, 1-dodecene, 1-tridecene, 1-tetradecene, 1-pentadecene, or combinations thereof. Preferably, the alpha-olefins are ethylene, propene, 1-butene, 4-methyl-pentene-l, 1-pentene, 1-hexene, 1-octene, and combinations of ethylene and/or propene with one or more of such other alpha-olefins.  Suitable dienes include those having from 4 to 30 carbon atoms, especially those having 5 to 18 carbon atoms.  Typical of these are a,co-dienes, a-internal dienes, including those dienes which are typically used for preparing EPDM type elastomers. Typical examples include 1,3-butadiene, 1,3- and 1,4-pentadiene, 1,3-, 1,4-, and 1,5-hexadiene, 1,7-octadiene, 1,9-decadiene, and lower alkyl substituted analogues of any of these.  Other preferred monomers include styrene, halo- or alkyl substituted styrenes, tetrafluoroethylene, vinylcyclobutene, dicyclopentadiene, and ethylidene norbornenes.  Suitable addition polymerizable monomers include also any mixtures of the above-mentioned monomers.<br>
The supported catalyst can be formed in situ  in the poljnnerization mixture by introducing into said mixture both a supported catalyst component of the present invention, or its components, as well as a suitable transition metal compound (c).<br>
The supported catalyst can be used as such or after being subjected to prepolymerization.  The prepolymerization can be carried out by any known<br>
i|2,173A-F<br><br>
methods such as by bringing a small amount of monomers, preferably alpha-olefins, into contact with the supported catalyst.<br>
The catalyst may be used in the polymerization reaction in a concentration of 10*9 to 10-3 moles, based on transition metal, per liter diluent or reaction volume, but is preferably used in a concentration of less than 10*5, preferably from 10-8 to 9x10-6 moles per liter diluent or reaction volume.<br>
The supported catalyst can be advantageously employed in a high pressure, solution, slurry or gas phase polymerization process.  A high pressure process is usually carried out at temperatures from 100°C to 400°C and at pressures above 500 bar.  A slurry process typically uses an inert hydrocarbon diluent and temperatures of from about 0°C up to a temperature just below the temperature at which the resulting polymer becomes substantially soluble in the inert polymerization medium.  Preferred temperatures are from about 30°C, preferably from about 60°C to about 115°C, preferably to about 100°C.  The solution process is carried out at temperatures from the temperature at which the resulting polymer is soluble in an inert solvent up to about 275°C. Generally, solubility of the poljmier depends on its density.  For ethylene copolymers having densities of 0.86 g/cm3, solution polymerization may be achieved at temperatures as low as about 60°C. Preferably, solution polymerization temperatures range from about 75°C , more preferably from about 80°C, and typically from about 130°C to about 260°C, more preferably to about 170°C.  Most preferably, temperatures in a solution process are between about 80°C and 150°C. As inert solvents typically<br>
i|2,173A-F<br><br>
hydrocarbons and preferably aliphatic hydrocarbons are used.  The solution and slurry processes are usually carried out at pressures between about 1 to 100 bar. Typical operating conditions for gas phase polymerizations are from 20°C to 100°C, more preferably from AO°C to 80°C.  In gas phase processes the pressure is typically from subatmospheric to 100 bar.<br>
Preferably for use in gas phase polymerization processes, the support has a median particle diameter from about 20 to about 200 pm, more preferably from about 30 nm to about 150 nm, and most preferably from about 50 iim to about 100 iim.  Preferably for use in slurry polymerization processes, the support has a median particle diameter from about 1 yim to about 200 Hm, more preferably from about 5 pim to about 100 nm, and most preferably from about 20 \m  to about 80 pim. Preferably for use in solution or high pressure polymerization processes, the support has a median particle diameter from about 1 ^im to about 40 jim, more preferably from about 2 \m  to about 30 iim, and most preferably from about 3 ym  to about 20 pm.<br>
Further details for polymerization conditions in a gas phase polymerization process can be found in U.S. Patents 4,588,790, 4,543,399, 5,352,749, 5,405,922, U.S. Application Serial No. 926,009, filed August 5, 1992 (corresponding to WO-94/03509), and U.S. Application Serial No. 122,582, filed September 17, 1993 (corresponding to WO-95/07942), which are incorporated herein by reference. Gas phase processes wherein condensed monomer or inert diluent is present are preferred.<br>
42,173A-F<br><br>
The supported catalysts of the present invention, also when used in a slurry process or gas phase process, not only are able to produce ethylene copolymers of densities typical for high density polyethylene, in the range of 0.970 to 0.940 g/cm3, but surprisingly, also enable the production of copolymers having substantially lower densities.  Copolymers of densities lower than 0.940 g/cm3 and especially lower than 0.930 g/cm3 down to 0.880 g/cm^ or lower can be made while retaining good bulk density properties and while preventing or substantially eliminating reactor fouling.  The present invention is capable of producing olefin polymers and copolymers having weight average molecular weights of more than 30,000, preferably more than 50,000, most preferably more than 100,000 up to 1,000,000 and even higher.  Typical molecular weight distributions M^/Mn range from 1.5 to 15, or even higher, preferably between 2.0 and 8.0.<br>
In the polymerization process of the present invention impurity scavengers may be used which serve to protect the supported catalyst from catalyst poisons such as water, oxygen, and polar compounds.  These scavengers can generally be used in amounts depending on the amounts of impurities.  Typical scavengers include organometal compounds, and preferably trialkylaluminum or boron compounds and alumoxanes.<br>
In the present polymerization process also molecular weight control agents can be used, such as hydrogen or other chain transfer agents.  The poljmiers that are prepared according to such polymerization process may be combined with any conventional additives, such as UV stabilizers, antioxidants, anti-slip or anti¬blocking agents, which may be added in conventional<br>
M2,173A-F<br><br>
ways, for example, downstream of the polymerization reactor, or in an extrusion or molding step.<br>
Upon or after removal of the polymerization mixture or product of from the polymerization reactor, the supported catalyst may be deactivated by exposure to air or water, or through any other catalyst deactivating agent or procedure.<br>
In the complex compounds of the present invention, preferably the compatible anion portion b.2) corresponds to general Formula (I):<br>
(I) wherein: <br>
M', Q, G, T, m, n, q, r, z, and d have the same definitions as in formula 1, and<br>
Pr is hydrogen H or a protecting group. Preferred protecting groups and charge balancing cations are illustrated hereinafter.<br>
The complex compounds containing anions b.2) can be prepared by combining a neutral compound, such as M'^^+Qj^, wherein M', Q, and m have the same meaning as in Formula (I), with an active metal derivative of the substituent comprising an active hydrogen moiety, such as a lithium or Grignard derivative thereof, for example Z(Gq(T-H)^), wherein' Z is Li+, MgCl+, MgBr+, or Mgl+, and G, T, H, q, and r have the same meanings as in Formula (I).  The group T-H can be protected during the preparation by methods which are well known by those skilled in the art.  For example, a hydroxy moiety may be protected by a trimethylsilyl group.  The method for preparing the complex compounds thus comprises combining<br>
42,173A-F<br><br>
in a suitable solvent or diluent a compound M '""'Qni with a compound of the formula Z^(Gq(T-Pr)^), wherein Z^ is [M X ]"*■ or [M ]■*■ and M is a Group 2 element, M  is a Group 1 element and X is halogen, G, T, Pr, q, and r have the same meaning as given for Formula (I), optionally followed by recovering the product complex.<br>
Suitable examples of protecting groups Pr include: trialkylsilyl, triarylsilyl, and mixtures thereof, preferably trimethylsilyl, t-<br>
butyldimethylsilyl, tri-isopropyl silyl, t-butyldiphenyl silyl, and phenyldimethylsilyl; preferably the protective group contains a bulky substituent, such as t-butyl or phenyl, to stabilize the resulting protected group during the subsequent metalation reaction.<br>
The reaction between the compound M '""*"Qin and Zl(Gq(T-Pr)r) is typically carried out in an ether or any other organic diluent that does not negatively impact the desired reaction, and mixtures thereof. Preferred ethers are tetrahydrofuran and diethylether. The temperature is not critical and is typically in the range of -20°C to 100°C.  The reaction mixture is preferably stirred and reacted for a period of between 5 minutes and 72 hours.<br>
It has been found advantageous to use a molar excess of the compound Z^(Gq(T-Pr)^) with respect to the compound M '^'^'Qni'  Such excess is preferably 1.1 to 3 mole equivalents, more preferably 1.5 to 2.5 mole equivalents of Z^ (Gq(T-Pr)r,) per mole of M'^^+Q^. Preferably, the reaction mixture is heated to a temperature between 40°C and 100°C, more preferably between 50°C and 95°C.  Using such process conditions were found to increase the conversion based on the<br>
i|2,173A-F<br><br>
compound M'^^+QJ^ up to 90^ and higher.  As the compound M "^+Qj^ is usually the more expensive reactant, it is highly desirable to increase the yield of the reaction with respect to this compound.<br>
The product complex is then preferably recovered, for example by decantation, filtration, advantageously followed by washing, preferably with a hydrocarbon, and drying.<br>
The protective group Pr when present in the product complex is preferably removed by conventional methods, such as reacting the product complex with water, alcohol, organic acids like acetic acid, organic anhydride compounds such as acetic anhydride containing iron trichloride, and tetra-hydrocarbyl ammonium fluorides, such as BU4NF.  It has been found advantageous to use the hydrogen fluoride adduct of a tertiary amine.  This adduct is capable of removing protecting groups, also those containing bulky ligands, such as t-butyl or phenyl, and thereby give a by-product ammonium cation which is a cation that can react with the transition metal compound to give a catalytically active complex.  Using this adduct is preferred over using a compound such as BuljNF, because the Bu^N cation which remains as by-product may render the activator anion less effective. Most preferably the HF adduct of such a tertiary amine is used which corresponds to the desired ammonium ion of the activator compound.  For example, triethylamine would give a triethylammonium cation.  Typically, the adduct comprises from 1 to 3 mole of HF per mole of amine, preferably 2.<br>
The product complex is preferably subjected to a cation exchange reaction with a further complex<br>
42,173A-F<br><br>
compound comprising a cation capable of reacting with a transition metal compound to form a catalytically active transition metal complex, and a charge balancing anion, wherein the cation and anion are contained in such relative quantities to provide a neutral complex compound.  The cation capable of reacting with a transition metal compound to form a catalytically active transition metal complex is preferably selected from the group of Bronsted acidic cations, carbonium cations, silylium cations, and cationic oxidizing agents.  The charge balancing anion preferably is a halide, sulphate, nitrate, or phosphate.<br>
The complex compounds used in the cation exchange reaction are known compounds or can be prepared according to conventional processes.  The cation exchange may be carried out in a suspension or solution or over a cation exchange column.  The cation exchange reaction and the removal of the optional protective groups Pr may be carried out simultaneously.<br>
The product of the cation exchange reaction is recovered, for example by decantation or filtration, and washed with preferably a hydrocarbon.  Subsequently, the product complex may be dried using conventional methods, such as applying reduced pressure, heat, employing solvent absorbents, or a combination of these.<br>
All reactions are preferably carried out under an inert atmosphere in the absence of oxygen and moisture.<br>
The compounds M '"'"0^ are known compounds, or can be prepared according to conventional methods.  The compounds of formula z"" (Gq(T-Pr)j,) are typically<br>
i42,173A-F<br><br>
prepared by reacting X" (Gq (T-Pr) r) or H(Gq (T-Pr)r), wherein X** has the same definition as given herein before, H is hydrogen and T-Pr is T-H or a protected T-H group, with M** or M*, respectively, wherein M** and M* are a Group 2 element and Group 1 element, respectively. The starting compounds X** (Gq (T-Pr) r) and H (Gq (T-Pr) r) can be prepared according to conventional organic synthesis methods.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a polymerization process wherein one or more olefins having from 2 to 8 carbons are contacted with a supported catalyst under gas phase polymerization conditions at a temperature from 20 to lOO^C and a pressure from 100 kPa to 10 Mpa or under slurry polymerization conditions at a temperature from 30 to 115°C and a pressure from 100 kPa to 10 Mpa to form a polymer, characterized in that the supported catalyst comprises: a) the reaction product of: 1) an organometal compound selected from an alumoxane; an aluminum compound of the formula AIR^x wherein R' independently each occurrence is hydrogen or a hydrocarbyl group having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, and x is 3; or a combination thereof, and 2) an activator compound comprising an anion corresponding to the formula:<br>
[BQ4.z'(Gq(T-H)r)z]'-<br>

Example 1 - Preparation of activator<br>
A.     To a solution of 4-BrMg(C6H4)0SiMe3 (ca. 20 mmol, prepared according to the procedure described in J. Org. Chem., 25, 1063, (1960), but using 1,2-dibromoethane instead of methyl iodide to initiate the reaction) in tetrahydrofuran (20 mL) was added slowly, with vigorous stirring, a solution of<br>
tris(pentafluorophenyDborane (4.3 grams, 8.4 mmol) in hexane (200 mL).  A viscous solid separated, and the mixture was stirred for 16 hours.  The top layer was then decanted from the solid and the residue washed with<br><br>
two 200 mL portions of hexane. The residue was dried under vacuum for 16 hours to yield a pale yellow tnicrocrystalline solid.  The solid was quenched with a solution of triethylaimnonium chloride in distilled water (85 mrnol in 200 mL) and the mixture stirred for 1 hour. The solution was decanted from the solid and the residue treated with a second portion of triethylaramonium chloride in distilled water (85 mmol in 200 mL).  After stirring 1 hour the solution was decanted and the solid washed with two 200 mL portions of distilled water.  The residue was dissolved in a mixture of methanol (80 mL) and water (4 mL) and stirred for 16 hours.  The solvents were then removed under reduced pressure and the solid dried under vacuum for 16 hours to yield 3.6 grams (60% yield based on tris(pentafluorophenyDborane) of a very pale yellow microcrystalline solid. The solid as analyzed by 13c and 19F NMR spectroscopy was found to be triethylaramonium tris(pentafluorophenyl)(4-hydroxyphenyDborate [NEt3H][(HOC6H4)B(C6F5)3].  The NMR data indicated the compound to be 95% pure. 19F NMR (tetrahydrofuran, ppm): -127.1 (doublet, 2F, ortho); -163.8 (triplet, IF, para); -165.9 (triplet, 2F, meta).  I3c NMR (tetrahydrofuran d-8, ppm): 150.5, J = 235 Hz; 138.7, J = 230 Hz; 140.0, J = 245 Hz; 130, broad; 155.8; 135.8; 115.0; 49.0; 11.0.<br>
B.     To a solution of 28.7 g (0.16 mol) p-bromophenol and 25.0 g (0.17 mol) t-butyldimethylsilyl chloride in THF was added 35 mL (0.25 mol) triethylamine.  A white precipitate was formed and the mixture was refluxed.  After 4 hours a sample was analyzed by GCMS (Gas Chromatography Mass Spectroscopy) and this indicated that the reaction was complete.  The precipitate was removed by filtration and washed with<br><br>
THF.  The THF was evaporated from the filtrate and the resulting orange-brown oil distilled under vacuum to yield 44.1 g (93%) of a colorless liquid having a boiling point of 75°C to 76°C at 0.15 mm Hg.  GCMS showed the product 4-bromophenoxy-t-butyldimethylsilane to be over 99% pure.<br>
A solution containing 92 mmol t-BuMe2SiOC6H4MgBr was prepared from 26.4 gram (92 mmol) t-BuMe2SiOC6H4Br and 2.7 gram (110 mmol) Mg in 100 mL THF.  The Grignard solution was decanted from the excess Mg.■ About 37 mmol of B(C6F5)3 was dissolved in THF (100 mL) and the resulting solution added to the solution of the Grignard reagent.  The clear homogeneous solution was warmed for 40 minutes on an SO^C waterbath.  i^F NMR analysis indicated a quantitative conversion to the desired borate.<br>
The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and a solution of 33 gram (250 mmol) EtaNHCl in water was added.  The THF was evaporated until the water began to distill.  Then, dichloromethane (200 mL) was added and the water phase separated.  The dichloromethane phase was washed with two 100 mL portions of water and two 100 mL portions of water containing CO2 (solid CO2 was added to the two phase system until the pH was 7).  The dichloromethane solution was dried over sodium sulphate, filtered and evaporated, resulting in an oil.  Yield 45 gram.  A iH NMR spectrum of this material showed the presence of t-BuMe2SiOC6H4B(C6F5)3.Et3NH and t-BuMe2SiOC6H5 in about a 1:1 molar ratio.  The oil was stirred with pentane (100 mL) for 15 minutes.  The pentane was decanted and the procedure repeated with another three 100 mL portions of pentane.  The resulting oil was dried inuacuo   (0.1 mbar)<br><br>
to yield a beige foam.  The yield was 33 gram (quantitative).  iH and i^F NMR spectra indicated the material to be almost pure t-BuMe2SiOC6H4B(C6F5)3.Et3NH.<br>
17 gram (20.7 mmol) of this product was dissolved in THF (100 mL).  To this solution, a mixture of Et3N.3HF (5 gram, 31.3 mmol) and EtsN (3.1 gram, 31.3 mmol) was added (effectively EtsN.ZHF).  After 14 hours iH and 19F NMR of the whole mixture showed that deprotection was complete and that no side products were formed.  The THF was evaporated and to the residue was added 100 mL of 0.5 M NaOH and 200 mL of diethylether. The aqueous phase was separated and the ether washed with three 50 mL portions of 0.5 M NaOH, two 50 mL portions of water and two 50 mL portions of water containing CO2.  The ether was dried over sodium sulphate, filtered and evaporated.  The residue was dissolved in 50 mL of dichloromethane and again evaporated (repeated three times).  The resulting beige foam was dried in vacuo (0.1 mbar) overnight which yielded 12.8 g of HOC6H4B(C6F5)3.Et3NH (about 90% yield based on B(C6F5)3).  ^H and ^^F NMR spectra showed the compound to be pure.  19F NMR (solvent THF-dg) ppm: -126.5 (doublet, 2F, ortho); -163.0 (triplet, IP, para); -165.5 (doublet, 2F, meta).  ^H NMR (solvent THF-dg): 1.25 (triplet, 9H); 3.15 (quartet, 6H); 6.35; 7.05 (AB, 4H); 7.05 (broad, 2H).<br>
C.     The starting compound 4-bromo-N-methylaminobenzene was synthesized from N-methyl-aminobenzene according to Organic Syntheses, Vol. 55, p. 20-24.<br>
The next step in the synthesis method is a modified version of that given in J. Org. Chem., 40,<br><br>
1090, 1975.  To a solution of 18.6 g (0.1 mole) 4-bromo-N-methylaminobenz ene in 200 mL THF was added at 0°C a solution of 67 mL of 1.5 molar n-butyllithium in hexane. A pale yellow precipitate was formed.  After 10 minutes a solution of 15.1 g (0.1 mole) of t-butyldimethylsilyl chloride in 20 mL THF was added.  The temperature of the reaction mixture was allowed to rise to room temperature and the mixture was then refluxed for 6 hours.  The solvents were evaporated and distillation of the residue gave 2.0 g (93%) of a yellow liquid 4-bromo-N-t-butyldimethylsilyl-N-methylaminobenzene at a distillation temperature of 100°C to 110°C at 0.3 mm Hg. The purity as determined by GCMS was at least 99.5%.<br>
To 2.4 g (0.1 mole) magnesium turnings was added approximately 10% of a solution of 28.0 g (93 mmole) of 4-bromo-N-t-butyldimethylsilyl-N-methylaminobenzene in 100 mL THF.  1,2-dibromoethane (100 111) was added and the reaction was started by warming up to reflux temperature.  The rest of the aniline solution was added in 40 minutes and the mixture was heated at regular times to keep the reaction going. After addition was complete the mixture was refluxed during 2 hours.  A sample was quenched with water and analyzed by GCMS: main peak: M = 221 (N-t-butyl-dimethylsilyl-N-methylaminobenzene).<br>
To the THF solution of Grignard reagent was added at room temperature with vigorous stirring 780 mL of a solution containing 31.2 mmole<br>
tris(pentafluorophenyl) boron in heptane.  The reaction mixture was stirred for 16 hours at room temperature.  A viscous material separated.  The top layer was decanted and the precipitate was washed with three portions of 100 mL hexane.  The residue was dried under vacuum (0.1<br><br>
ram Hg) for a few hours to yield a white foam.  This product magnesiumbromide(4-N-t-butyldimethylsilyl-N-methylaminophenyl)-tris(pentafluorophenyl)borate was used for the next step without further purification.<br>
To the reaction product of the previous step was added a solution of 60 g triethylatnmonium chloride in 100 mL demineralized water.  The mixture was stirred for 2 hours and a homogeneous emulsion formed.  The reaction mixture was extracted with four portions of 50 mL dichloromethane and the combined dichloromethane extracts were washed three times with 50 mL demineralized water. The dichloromethane was dried over magnesium sulphate.  Filtration and evaporation of the solvent gave the product triethylammonium (4-N-t-butyldimethylsilyl-N-methylaminophenyl)-tris(pentafluorophenyl)borate.<br>
The product of the previous reaction step was dissolved in a mixture of 150 mL methanol, 50 mL water and 2 g triethylammonium chloride and was stirred for 16 hours at room temperature.  The methanol was evaporated and 100 mL demineralized water was added to the residue. The suspension was extracted with four portions of 30 mL dichloromethane and the combined dichloromethane extracts were dried over magnesium sulphate.  After filtration and evaporation of the solvent 19.6 g (76%) of a dark brown powder remained.  For further purification the product was washed three times with toluene.  To remove the last traces of toluene the material was mixed two times with 40 mL dichloromethane and the solvent was evaporated.  In the course of this treatment the material became less soluble in this solvent. For the last purification step the product was mixed with 100 mL dichloromethane and heated.  After<br><br>
cooling, the material was filtered over a Buchner funnel to give after drying in vacuo 12.8 g (50%) of the pure product triethylamrnonium (A-N-methylatninophenyl )tris-(pentafluorophenyl)borate.<br>

The dichloromethane solution was washed five times with portions of 20 mL water and then dried over magnesium sulphate.  The mixture was filtered, and the filtrate evaporated to dryness under vacuum to afford the appropriate ammonium salt.  The yield in each case was 90% and multinuclear NMR spectroscopy was in full agreement with the proposed structures.<br>

Example 27 - Polymerization Runs<br>
A 10 liter autoclave reactor was charged with 6 liter anhydrous hexane, 1 liter of hydrogen gas, and the reactor contents heated to 80°C, unless indicated otherwise, at which temperature the polymerization mixture was maintained during polymerization.  Ethylene was then added in order to raise the pressure to the desired operating level of 10 bar, unless indicated<br><br>
otherwise.  A sample of supported catalyst as prepared in the previous examples and comparative examples was added to the reactor through a pressurized addition cylinder in the amounts indicated in the table below. Ethylene was supplied to the reactor continuously to keep the pressure constant.  After the desired reaction time the ethylene line was blocked and the reactor contents were dumped to a sample container.  The hexane was removed from the poljmier and the polymer dried overnight and then weighed to determine catalyst efficiencies.  In none of the inventive examples did substantial reactor fouling occur and all examples gave a polymer in a free flowing powder form.<br>
The table summarizes the specific conditions and the results of slurry polymerizations with the above prepared supported catalyst.<br>
Example 28 - Continuous Slurry Phase Polymerizations<br>
20 gram of triethylaluminum treated Si02 (prepared as in Example 22) was slurried in toluene (200 mL) and the mixture heated to 80°C.

The borate solution was added to the support slurry and the mixture stirred and kept at 80°C for 2 hours.  The mixture was cooled and stirred overnight.  The toluene was decanted from the support and replaced with hexane (800 mL).  This procedure was repeated.  8 mmol of MMAO type 3A (20 weight percent solution in heptane from AKZO) was added and the mixture stirred for 15 minutes.  11.2 mL of a 0.0714 M solution of MCpTi(II) was added and the mixture stirred for 2<br><br>
hours before use.  The support contained a boron loading of 80 micromol/g and a titanium loading of 40 micromol/g.<br>
Isopentane, ethylene, 1-butene (if required), hydrogen, and supported catalyst were continuously fed into a 10 L jacketed, continuously stirred tank reactor and the slurry product formed was removed continuously. The total pressure in all polymerization runs was 15 bar and the temperature was maintained at 70°C.  The slurry withdrawn was fed to a flash tank to remove the diluent and the dry, free-flowing polymer powder was collected.

vacuum.  To 10 gram of the resulting powder was added toluene (150 mL).  The mixture was stirred for a few minutes to disperse the support.  This slurry was added to a solution of triethylammonium<br>
tris(pentafluorophenyl)(4-hydroxyphenyl)borate (0.565 gram, 0.8 mmol) in toluene (250 mL) which had been heated to TO'C and kept at 70°C for 1 hour.  Upon addition, the heating was removed and the mixture stirred at ambient temperature for 16 hours.  A 50 mL aliquot of the slurry was treated with 0.7 mL of a 0.0714 M solution of MCpTi(ll) (50 micromol Ti) followed by 500 micromol of MMAO and the mixture was stirred for 1 hour to yield a green-brown colored supported catalyst.  Aliquots of this supported catalyst containing 2 and 1.25 micromol of titanium, respectively, were used.<br>
A 3 liter autoclave reactor was charged with the desired amount of 1-octene followed by an amount of ISOPAR™ E sufficient to give a total volume of 1500 mL. 300 mL of hydrogen gas was added and the reactor contents were heated to the desired temperature. Ethylene was then added sufficient to bring the pressure of the system to 30 bar.  A supported catalyst was added to initiate the polymerization and ethylene was supplied to the reactor continuously on demand. After 10 minutes the ethylene line was blocked and the reactor contents were dumped into a sample container.  The polymer was dried overnight and then weighed to determine catalyst efficiencies.  The specific conditions were:  Run 1: 121 mL octene; temperature of 130°C; to give 82 g of product (efficiency 854,000 based on g PE/g Ti) of a melt index (at 190°C/2.16 kg load) of 3.8 and a density of 0.9137.
