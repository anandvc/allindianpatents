				<td>This invention relates to an improved process for the production 88 of crystalline, porous aluminosilicate 88 zeolites.  Zeolites are an important class  of solid, crystalline, microporous materials because of their unique catalytic and adsorption properties.<br>
Zeolites are crystalline solid alurainosilicates with three dimensional frame-work composed of [SiO4]4- and [A1O4]5-tetrahedra in sucli a way that two aluminiums are not adjacent. Zeolites are represented as:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
where M is a charge coupansating cation with valence n, genarally an element from group 1 or II of the periodic table or an organic cation. The ratio of x/y can be one or more. Z represents the number of water molecules which are reversibly adsorbed in the zeolite pores.<br>
These zeolites are commonly prepared under hydrothermal conditions at autoger.eous pressure. Generally, the reaction mixture, comprising «:f the sources of silica, alumina, alkali cation and optionally a nitogen containing organic template selected from corimon.y used mono or di quaternary ammonium compounds or amines, is filled in a container which is then closed to the extent o:: air tightness, heated in the range 80-200 °C for few hours to fet days or even weeks till fully crystalline<br>
material is obtained. Depending upon the chemical composition, method of preparatr.on, organic template and temperature and time required for crystallization, various zeolites with different chemical compositions and crystallographic dimentions are formed. [See; (1): P.A. Jacobs and J.A. Martens, Studies in Surface Science and Catalysis vol. 33, year 1987; (2):H.G. Karge and J. Weitkamp (editors), Studies in Surface Science and Catalysis, vol 46 year 1989].<br>
The major drawback of "he prior art method for the preparation of zeolites is that the desired material(s), prepared by optimizing the various synthesis parameters like the composition of the starting reaction mixture and crystallization temperature, require relatively lower time to obtain the desired material. Further, this process of optimazation of synthesis parameters is required for each individual zeolite composition and structure. Furthermore, in nost of the cases, particularly wherein x/y ratio is 10 or more, :he time required is quite long, generally ranging between 1 to 10 days in the temperature range of 100 to 200 °C [see P.A. Jacobs and J.A. Martens, Studies in Surface Science and Catalysis vol. 33, year 1987].<br>
Another drawback of the prior art methods of preparing  zeolites, is that due to relativlely long crystallization time,  generally large  distribution of partcle or crystallite size and  shape  is obtained mainly due to secondary crystallization and  overlaping nucleation  and  crystallization processes  during hydrothermal<br>
syntheis of zeolites. This inhomogeneous disribution of crystallites size and shape adversally affect the catalytic properties of the zeolites. Apart from this, the loger crystallization time at higher temperature consumes more energy and thus adding to the cost of the material.<br>
The main objective of the present invention therefore is to develop a general method for efficient and faster synthesis of zeolites, represented by the general formula given herein before, by using some promoters, which are the oxianions (oxiacids or their salts) of the elements selectecd from groups V A and VII A of the periodic table and can be represented by a common formula as given below and herein after mentioned as promoter :<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
where M is charge balancing cation of valency n, E is a cation of charge e of an element from group V A or VII A, 0 is an oxygen anion with -2 valency and z, net negative charge on (E04)x~ anion, where x — -:i + e (where e may be 5 or 7) . More specifically, M may be a monovalent or a divalent cation selected from H+, Li+, Na+, K+, Cs+, NH4+, Mg2+, Ca2+ or mixtures thereof, and Ee+ may J:e P5+, As5+, Sb5+, Cl5+, Br5+, I5+, Cl7+, Br7+ or I7+, e.g. H3PO°1, H3ASO4' HClO4 etc.<br>
Accordingly the ma:.n objective of present invention is to provide an  improved process  for efficient and  significantly  faster<br>
preparation of zeolites using promoters. Another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of zeolite at a reduced crystallization time and / or crystallization temperature.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention describes an improved process<br>
for the preparation of zeolites of the  formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
 (where M is a charge compensating cation of valence n, an element from group I or II of the periodic table selected fron H+. Li+, Na+, K+, Cs+, NH4+, Mg2+, Ca2+ or mixtures thereof, or ai: organic cation and where the ratio x/y can be one or more and z represents the number of water molecules<br>

comprises mixinc a- room temperature, (a) a source of silica, (b) a source of alumina, (c) optionally a source of alkali metal oxide, (d optionally a nitrogen containing organic base or quaternary amm<:nium salt commonly known as template a source of promoter having formula mz and water at room temperature heating the resultant mixture temerature ranging betveen for period from to hours filtering washing drying calcining solid conpos te material in range subjecting resulting composite conventional ion-exchange treatement with></:nium>

The molar composition of the gel in terms of the moles of oxides was: SiO2 : 0.05 A12O3 : 0.125 Na2O : 0.125 (TPA)2O : 30 H2O.
