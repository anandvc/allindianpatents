				<td>Description<br>
The invention relates to a method of controlling receipt of signals at a terminal of a<br>
communications system, in particular for a mobile radio communications system.<br>
In radio communications system, signals are exchanged between radio terminals and<br>
radio stations to base stations via a so called radio interface or air interface. Such<br>
radio terminals are mobile or stationary user terminals or user equipments (UE). The<br>
base stations or Node Bs are access stations that are associated with a land based<br>
communication network. Examples of known radio communication systems are<br>
second generation digital mobile radio communication systems such as global<br>
system for mobile communication (GSM), based on time division multiple access<br>
(TDMA) and providing data rates up to 100 kbit/s, or third generation digital mobile<br>
radio communication systems such as universal mobile telecommunication system<br>
(UMTS), based on code division multiple access (CDMA) with data rates up to 2<br>
Mbit/s.<br>
A new feature in current radio communication systems such as GSM, GSM edge<br>
radio access network (GERAN) and UMTS, UMTS terrestrial radio access network<br>
(UTRAN) is the provision of multimedia broadcast multicast service (MBMS). Radio<br>
bearers for multicast MBMS services are set up within a cell of a base station, if there<br>
are user equipments present in the cell with the particular MBMS service activated.<br>
One of the main differences between MBMS and previous services is that MBMS can<br>
be offered and used when the user equipment is an idle mode, i.e. without an<br>
established radio connection to the network. The service uses a point-to-multipoint<br>
connection, either in a multicast or broadcast mode. General principles of MBMS are<br>
described in the standard documents 3GPP TR 25.992, V1.2.0 (2003-01) "Multimedia<br>
Broadcast Multicast Service (MBMS); UTRAN/GERAN Requirements", TS 23.846,<br>
V6.1.0 (2003-01) "MBMS; Architecture and functional description (Release 6)", TS<br>
22.146, V6.6.0 (2004-10) "MBMS ; Stage 1 (Release 6)" and TS 45.002, V6.6.0<br>
(2004-05) "Multiplexing and multiple access on the radio path (Release 6).<br>
With the introduction of MBMS in UTRAN, a significant amount of control information<br>
related to the MBMS configuration in the cell of a base station is provided on an<br>
MBMS control channel (MCCH). A UE is required to periodically read this MCCH<br>
based upon the provision of services in the cell for which the UE is registered. The<br>
information scheduling and further parameters of the MCCH are described in detail in<br>
the standard document 3GPP TS 25.346.V6.2.0 (2004-09), chapter 5.2.<br>
However, existing UE behaviour specifies that a UE is required to periodically make<br>
measurements of the neighbour cells in order for a UE to choose the cell in which it<br>
should operate. These measurements require the UE to measure channels provided<br>
in other cells, but a single receiver UE is unable to measure these channels and<br>
listen in its own cells at the same time.<br>
This problem is exacerbated if the period over which the MCCH is repeated is a<br>
multiple of the frequency of occurrence of the occasions when the UE is required to<br>
perform neighbour cell measurements.<br>
Information provided on the MCCH is repeated over a period of time known as the<br>
modification period, as defined in the above TS 25.346. This time interval defines the<br>
period over which one static set of MCCH information is provided to the UE. Some<br>
information used for notification purposes may change over this period, but this is not<br>
significant. Information within a modification period is repeated a number of times,<br>
each repetition being known as a repetition period. Each modification period is an<br>
exact multiple of a repetition period.<br>
At the start of each modification period an index is sent which contains information<br>
about which services ongoing in the cell have had some configuration parameters<br>
changed since the last modification period and which have remained the same. This<br>
index is sent in order to reduce the amount of time the UE is required to read MCCH<br>
each modification period. If the index is not correctly read, the UE must read the<br>
whole of MCCH unti! it has successfully read all information.<br>
Therefore, a method for efficiently establishing new connections in situations<br>
described above is required.<br>

WG4#32, R4-040437; 16.-20.08.2004; pages 1 to 11; XP002362097 describes the<br>
existence of the problem of the conflict between inter-frequency and inter-RAT<br>
measurement with MBMS decoding during MBMS sessions.<br>
Siemens ; "Measurement requirements and MBMS reception in Cell-FACH state";<br>
3GPP TSG RAN WG4#32, R4-040413; 18.20.08.2004; pages 1 to 5; XP002362098<br>
describes a number of options for dealing with the impact of MBMS data loss on<br>
MBMS quality of service.<br>
In accordance with a first aspect of the present invention, a method of controlling<br>
receipt of signals at a terminal of a communications system comprises receiving data<br>
on at least one control channel from a first base station; wherein the at least one<br>
control channel is associated with a multimedia broadcast multicast service (MBMS)<br>
channel; wherein the terminal is adapted to periodically perform measurements on<br>
signals transmitted by at least one second base station; wherein the terminal<br>
determines whether a period in which data signals are on the at least one control<br>
channel at least partially overlaps with a period for performing measurements; and, if<br>
thete is an overlap, the terminal disables performance of measurements in favour of<br>
receipt of data on the at least one control channel.<br>
Conventionally, measurements of neighbour cells take absolute priority, however, the<br>
present invention makes use of the fact that a sufficiently good quality set of<br>
measurements can be obtained in fewer measurement periods than those specified,<br>
so rather than delay a measurement when there is a conflict between receiving<br>
control data and taking the measurements, as proposed in some prior art systems,<br>
the present invention simply discards taking measurements in that particular<br>
measurement period and uses only the measurements obtained in other periods,<br>
whilst giving priority in the circumstances to receipt of control data in that period. This<br>
improves overall efficiency of the system.<br>
Preferably, the data on the at least one control channel is repeated periodically.<br>
Preferably, the data on the at least one control channel relates to changes in the<br>
configuration of the associated MBMS channel.<br>
Preferably, performance of measurements is disabled until all data on the changes<br>
has been received by the terminal.<br>
In accordance with a second aspect of the present invention, a terminal for a<br>
communication system comprises receiving means for receiving data on at least one<br>
control channel from a first base station; wherein the at least one control channel is<br>
associated with a multimedia broadcast multicast service (MBMS) channel;<br>
measuring means for periodically performing measurements on signals transmitted<br>
by at least one second base station; processing means for determining whether a<br>
period in which data signals are on the at least one control channel at least partially<br>
overlaps with a period for performing measurements, and, disabling means for<br>
disabling performance of measurements in favour of the receipt of data on the at<br>
least one control channel, if there is an overlap.<br>
The terminal could be a static terminal, but preferably the terminal is a mobile<br>
terminal.<br>
In accordance with a third aspect of the present invention a communication system<br>
comprises at least one base station and at least one terminal, for carrying out a<br>
method according to the first aspect.<br>
Preferably the at least one terminal is a mobile terminal according to the second<br>
aspect.<br>
An example of a method and apparatus according to the present invention will now<br>
be described with reference to the accompanying drawings in which;<br>
Figure 1 shows a block diagram of a radio communication network for the present<br>
invention;<br>
Figure 2 illustrates relative occurrence of control channel data and measurement time<br>
periods for applying the method of the present invention.<br>
Fig.1 shows a typical arrangement whereby a terminal 1 sends data to a base station<br>
2 and receives signaling from the base station on the MBMS control channel<br>
(MCCH). At various times, the terminal 1 must take measurements of neighbour cells<br>
3 and 4.<br>
As shown in Fig.2, there can be conflict if a time period in which data is being<br>
transmitted on the MCCH overlaps or coincides with a time period in which a<br>
measurement of the neighbour cells is to be made.<br>
Initially, a data block D1 is transmitted and a measurement period M1 occurs after<br>
this. Next, an index 12 is sent, followed by a the next data block D2. A second<br>
measurements period M2 is allocated immediately followed by a third measurement<br>
period M3. However, M3 overlaps with the next MCCH period, beginning with index<br>
13. Therefore, the terminal 1 reads the index and if the index 13 indicates that there is<br>
information of relevance to the terminal, then reading of D3 takes precedence over<br>
the measurement of neighbour cells.<br>
Thus, for any occasion when the UE detects that a measurement period and an<br>
MCCH modification period boundary or repetition period occur at the same time, the<br>
UE initially gives priority to reading the MCCH until the UE has successfully read the<br>
index. If a UE has read the index for this modification period and this indicates that<br>
there is nothing for the UE to read in this MCCH modification period, the UE<br>
continues with the measurement periods as currently specified. If the UE reads the<br>
index for this modification period, and the index indicates that there is information of<br>
relevance to the UE, then the UE gives priority to reading the MCCH, rather than to<br>
the coinciding measurement occasions until the UE has successfully read the MCCH<br>
block which carries the relevant service information. Thereafter, the UE proceeds<br>
with the measurement periods as specified.<br><br><br><br><br>
