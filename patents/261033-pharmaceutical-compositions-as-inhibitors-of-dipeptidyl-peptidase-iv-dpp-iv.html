				<td>Pharmaceutical Compositions As Inhibitors of Pipeptidyl Peptidase-IV (DPP-IV)<br>
Cross-Reference Section to Related Applications<br>
This application claims the benefit of priority of Provisional U.S. Application Ser. No. 60/712,646, which was filed August 30, 2005, and is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
Field of fee Invention<br>
The present invention relates to compounds which inhibit dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) and are useful for the prevention or treatment of diabetes, especially type II diabetes, as well as hyperglycemia, metabolic syndrome, hyperinsulinemia, obesity, cardiovascular diseases and disorders including atherosclerosis, cerebrovascular diseases, diseases and disorders of the central nervous system including schizophrenia, anxiety, bipolar disease, depression, insomnia, cognitive disorders, gastrointestinal diseases and disorders, cancer, inflammation and inflammatory diseases, respiratory diseases and disorders, musculo-skeletal disorders, osteoporosis, menopausal symptoms, disorders, periodontal diseases including gingivitis, and various immunomodulatory diseases,.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-W, CD26, EC 3.4.14.5) is a serine protease with specificity for cleaving Xaa-Pro and, to a lesser extent, Xaa-Ala dipeptides from the N-termini of polypeptides and proteins. DPP-IV is a non-classical serine protease in that the • catalytic triad of Ser-Asp-His, found in the C-terminal region of the enzyme, is in reverse order to that found in classical serine proteases. DPP-IV is widely expressed in mammalian tissue as a type n integral membrane protein. DPP-IV is expressed on the surface of differentiated epithelial cells of the intestine, liver, kidney proximal tubules, prostate, corpus luteum, and on leukocyte subsets such as lymphocytes and macrophages. A soluble form of the enzyme is found in serum that has structure and function identical to the membrane-bound form of the enzyme but lacks the hydrophobic transmembrane domain.<br>
DPP-IV has many physiologically relevant substrates such as chemokines, RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted), eotaxin, and macrophage-<br>
derived chemokine, neuropeptides such as NPY (neuropeptide Y) and substance P, vasoactive peptides, and incretins such as GLP-1 (glucagon-Hke peptide-1) and GIF (gastric inhibitory geptide/ glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide). GLP-1 is a 30 amino acid peptide hormone produced in the L cells of the distal small intestine in response to ingested nutrients. GLP-1 binding to its receptor on various tissues stimulates insulin gene expression, biosynthesis and glucose-dependent insulin secretion, inhibits glucagon secretion, promotes satiety, slows gastric emptying and promotes growth of pancreatic beta cells. Based on this profile, GLP-1-based therapies are expected to be beneficial in the treatment of type n diabetes and obesity. Studies in which type II diabetic patients have been infused with GLP-1 have demonstrated efficacy in normalizing both fasted and prandial glycemia. However, active GLP-1 (7-36) amide is rapidly converted by DPP-IV to GLP-1 (9-36), which is inactive or is a receptor antagonist. The short half-life of GLP-1 in the circulation (1-1.5 minutes) is a major obstacle to its use as a therapeutic agent. To circumvent the drawback of the short half-life of GLP-1, inhibitors of DPP-IV, the primary degradative enzyme of GLP-1, increase the level of active circulating GLP-1 (7-36) amide. DPP-IV inhibitors have been demonstrated to improve glucose tolerance in type n diabetes.<br>
The inhibition of DPP-IV provides for an attractive therapeutic treatment for type H diabetes and obesity. Although DPP-IV inhibitors have demonstrated improved glucose tolerance in type n diabetes, many suffer from having short half-life and toxicity. Therefore, there is a need for DPP-IV inhibitors having an unproved pharmacological profile as an alternative for the treatment of type n diabetes.<br>

Biological Data Isolation of rat DPP-IV<br>
DPP-IV was purified to homogeneity (electrophoretic) from rat kidney as described in Arch. Biochem. Biophy. 1995, 323, 148-154. Rat kidney (120 g) was homogenized in 4 volumes of water and the homogenate centrifuged for 15 minutes at lOOOg. The pH of the supernatant was adjusted to 3.9 with 1M HC1 and the enzyme solubilized by autolysis for 18 hours at 37 °C. The pH of the supernatant collected after centrifugation was adjusted to 7.2 with 1 M Trizma base and the enzyme was precipitated with (NH^SCU at 90% saturation (662 g solid ammonium sulfate per liter of solution). The sblubilized precipitate was chromatographed on Sephadex G-200 (1 m x 5 cm) equilibrated with a 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer pH 7.5 containing NaCl at a final concentration of 0.1 M and developed from the bottom. Fractions containing enzymatic activity were pooled, chr&gt;matographed on DE-52 (16 x 2.5 cm) equilibrated with 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and eluted with a 250-mL linear 0-0.4 M NaCl gradient prepared in 10 mM Tris-HCl. DPP-IV was then resolved from other brush border peptidases by chromatography on a phenyl Sepharose column (12 x 2 cm) equilibrated with 25% (NH^SC^ at saturation (144 g ammonium sulfate per liter of 0.05 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5). The enzyme was eluted in a homogeneous form with a 200-mL linear gradient of 25-0% (NHU^SQj,prepared in 0.05 MTris HC1 buffer. Isolation of Human DPP-IV<br>
Caco-2 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (P.O. Box 3605, Manassas, VA), cultured and maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in low glucose DMEM media supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum and antibiotic/antimycotic. In preparation for making an extract, cells were seeded at a density to achieve confluence within 7 days. The<br>
cells were cultured for an additional 14 days to allow for maximal DPPIV expression. On the day of harvest, cells were washed once with Dulbecco's PBS and solubilized in a 10 mM NaCl containing 50 mM Tris HC1,0.5% Nonidet P40 and 0.3 ug/mL aprotinin at pH 8.0. The extract was clarified by centrifugation at 35,000 g for 30 minutes at 4 °C. Human DPP-TV was purified from this extract supernatant, using precipitation with (NELOaSCU at 90% saturation, as described for the rat DPP-IV. Human DPP-IV was purified from this solubilized precipitate by the same procedure as described for the solubilized precipitate of rat DPP-IV. The purified enzyme was stored frozen at -70 °C as drops collected hi liquid nitrogen. Inhibition constant determination for DPP-IV<br>
DPP-TV activity was determined by measuring the rate of hydrolysis of a surrogate substrate Gly-Pro-7-amido-methylcoumarin (Gly-Pro-AMC, Catalogue #G-2761, Sigma, St. Louis, MO). The assay is carried out at room temperature in black 96 well polypropylene or polyethylene plates in a total volume of 100 |j,L per well. Appropriate dilutions of the compounds are made in DMSO and then diluted ten fold into water. !0 jiL of 5 concentrations of the compound of formula (I) (inhibitor) or 10% DMSO in water are added to individual wells containing 80 uL of DPP-IV diluted in assay buffer containing 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl and 0.12 mg/mL BSA. After 10 minutes at room temperature, the reaction is initiated by adding 10 uL of either 280, 700, 1750, or 3500 \\M Gly-Pro-AMC in water. The DPP-IV activity results in the formation of the fluorescent product amido-methylcoumarin (AMC) which is continuously monitored by excitation at 350 nm and measurement of fluorescent emission at 460 nm every 112 seconds for 37 minutes using an appropriate plate reader. The fluorescence at 460 nm is converted to nanomoles of AMC using a standard curve and the initial rate of AMC formation is crlculated. For each concentration of each of the compounds of formula (I) (inhibitor) or DMSO control, the initial rates are used to fit the rectangular hyperbola of Michaelis-Menten by non-linear regression analysis (GraphPad Software Prism 3.0). The ratio of the apparent Km/Vmax vs. inhibitor concentration is plotted and the competitive Ki is calculated by linear regression to be the negative x-intercept. The uncompetitive Ki is similarly calculated from the x-intercept of the plot of the reciprocal of the apparent Vmax versus the inhibitor concentration (Cornish-Bowden, A. 1995. Fundamentals of Enzyme Kinetics. Revised edition. Portland Press, Lid.., London, U.K.).<br>

As inhibitors of DPP-IV action, the compounds of the present invention are useful in treating disorders that are mediated by DPP-IV. Disorders that are mediated by DPP-IV include diabetes, type n diabetes, hyperglycemia, Syndrome X, hypcdnsulinemia and<br>
obesity. Therefore the compounds of the present invention are useful in treating the disorder of diabetes, type n diabetes, hyperglycemia, Syndrome X, hyperinsulinemia and obesity.<br>
Dipeptidyl-peptidase IV (DPP-IV, EC 3.4.14.5; CD26) is a post-proline cleaving serine protease with significant homology to other alpha-beta hydroxylases (e.g. prolyl oligopeptidase). DPP-IV is found throughout the body, both circulating in plasma and as a type H membrane protein produced by a variety of tissues, including kidney, liver and intestine. DPP-IV plays a role in the cleavage of specific substrates with accessible amino-terminal Xaa-Pro- or Xaa-Ala- dipeptide sequences, resulting in their inactivation or alteration in their biological activities. Important DPP-IV substrates include growth hormone releasing hormone, glucagon-like peptides GLP-1 and 2, gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) and certain chemokines like RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted), stromal cell-derived factor, eotaxin, and macrophage-derived chemokine (Mentlein, R. Regulatory Peptides, 1999,85,9-24).<br>
The DPP-IV substrate, glucagon-like peptide GLP-1, is released from L cells in the distal small intestine and colon after oral ingestion of nutrients. The active GLP-1 (7-36) amide is an incretin that increases glucose stimulated insulin secretion (Drucker, D, J. Diabetes, 1998, 47, 159-169). Other activities attributed to GLP-1 (7-36) amide include stimulation of insulin gene expression, trophic effects on pancreatic beta cells, inhibition of glucagon secretion, promotion of satiety, inhibition of food intake, and slowing of gastric emptying (Drucker, D. J. Diabetes, 1998, 47, 159-169). These effects of GLP-1 (7-36) amide contribute to glucose homeostasis and the normalization of blood glucose levels in conditions of impaired glucose tolerance, hi this regard, GLP-1 (7-36) amide lias been demonstrated to reduce postprandial and fasting glycemia in patients with insulin-dependent and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (Nauck, et al., Hormone Metab. Res. 2002, 29, 411-416; Gutniak et al., J. Internal Medicine, 2001, 250, 81-87; Rauchman, et al., Diabetologia. 1997, 40, 205-11; Ahren, B., BioEssays 1998, 20, 642-51). GLP-1 based therapy has therapeutic potential for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. However, active GLP-1 (7-36) amide is rapidly converted to GLP-1 (9-36) amide by DPP-W cleavage of the arnino-terminal His-Ala- dipeptide of GLP-1 (7-36) amide (Mentlein, et al., Eur. J. Biochem. 1993, 214, 829-835). The resulting GLP-1 (9-36) amide is inactive and is an antagonist of the GLP-1 receptor (Knudson, et al., Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996, 318,429-35). The short half-life of GLP-1 (7-36) amide in the circulation (1-1.5 minutes) makes it impractical as a<br>
therapeutic agent and has led to the development of alternative strategies to enhance the anti-diabetogenic activity of GLP-1. One strategy is to increase the circulating half-life of GLP-1, by inhibiting DPP-IV activity (Deacon, et al., Diabetes 1995, 44 1126-31). Inhibition of DPP-IV in vivo increases the level of circulating GLP-1 (7-36) amide with a concomitant increase in its insulinotropic effect (Deacon, et al., Diabetes. 1998, 47, 764-9). A DPP-IV inhibitor has been demonstrated to improve glucose tolerance in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (Ahren B, et al., Diabetes Care 2002, 25, 869-875). Therefore, the compounds of the present invention, including but not limited to those specified in the examples can be used hi the treatment of conditions caused by or associated with impaired glucose tolerance including the prevention or treatment of diabetes, especially non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia and metabolic syndrome (Johannsson, et al., J. Endocrinol. Invest. 1999,22(5 Suppl), 41-6).<br>
Striking similarities exist between the metabolic syndrome (syndrome X) and untreated growth hormone deficiency. Abdominal/visceral obesity and insulin resistance characterize both syndromes (Reaven, GM, Physiol Rev. 1995, 75,473-86; Johansson, et al., Metabolism 1995, 44, 1126-29). Growth hormone favorably effects some of the perturbations associated with abdominal/visceral obesity, including reduction in abdominal/visceral obesity, improved insulin sensitivity and lipoprotein metabolism ana reduction in diastolic blood pressure (Barreto-Filho, et al., J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab, 2002, 87(5), 2018-23; Colao et al., J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002, 57(3), 1088-93: Gotherstrom, et al., J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001, 56(10), 4657-65; Johannsson, et al., J. Endocrinol. Invest. 1999, 22(5 Suppl), 41-6; Johannsson, et al., J. Clin. Endocrinol. Mt.tab. 1997, 52(3), 727-34).<br>
For the treatment of diabetes or Syndrome X, compounds of the present invention can be used alone, or in combination with any existing anti-diabetic agent. Agents which can be used in combination with the compounds of the present invention include, but are not limited to insulin, an insulin analog such as mecasermin and the like, an insulin secretagogue such as nateglinide and the like, a biguanide such as metformin and the like, a sulfonylurea such as chlorpropamide, glipizide, glyburide, and the like, an insulin sensitizing agent such as a PPARy agonist such as troglitazone, pioglitazone, rosiglitazone, and the like, an a-glucosidase inhibitor such as acarbose, voglibose, miglitol and the like, an aldose reductase inhibitor such as zopolrestat and the like, a metiglinide such as repaglinide and the like, a<br>

The ability of the compounds of the present invention to treat diabetes, alone or in combination with another agent, can be demonstrated according to the methods described by Zander, M.; Mustafa, T.; Toft-Nielsen, M.-B.; Madsbad, S.; Hoist, J. J. in Diabetes Care 2001, 24, 720-725; or. according to the methods described herein.<br>
DPP-IV-mediated proteolysis has been established as a major route of growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH) degradation and inactivation (Kubiafc, et al., Drug Metab. Dispos. 1989, 77, 393-7). GHRH-derivatives that are resistant to DPP-IV cleavage are more potent in increasing serum growth hormone levels when administered i.v. due to longer stability in vivo. DPP-IV inhibition would be predicted to increase GHRH levels and thus serum growth hormone levels. Therefore, the compounds of the present invention, including but not limited to those specified in the examples can be used m the treatment of conditions associated with deficiency in growth hormone including metabolic disorders (central obesity, dyslipidemia), osteoporosis and frailty of aging.<br>
Diabetic dyslipidemia is characterized by multiple lipoprotein defects including moderately high serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides, small LDL particles and low levels of HDL cholesterol. The dyslipidemia associated with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus is improved in conjunction with improved diabetic condition following treatment with GLP-1 (Junti-Berggren, et al., Diabetes Care 1996,19, 1200-6). DPP-IV inhibition is predicted to increase the level of circulating GLP-1 (7-36) amide and thereby would be effective in the treatment of diabetic dyslipidemia and associated complications. Therefore, the compounds of the present invention, including but not limited to those specified in the examples can be used in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia, hypert'glyc'vudsmia and associated cardiovascular disease.<br>
Parenteral injection of GLP-1 (7-36) amide in healthy men, obese men or patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus has been reported to promote satiety and to suppress food intake (Flint, et al., /. Gin. Invest. 1998,101, 515-520; Naslund, et al., Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1998, 68, 525-530; Gutzwiller, et al., Am. J. Physiol. 1999,276, R1541-R1544.) DPP-IV inhibition is predicted to increase the level of circulating GLP-t (7-36) amide and thereby increases satiety in obesity and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Therefor, the compounds of the present invention, including but not limited to those specified in the<br>
examples can be used in the treatment of obesity.<br>
For the treatment of obesity, compounds of the present invention can be used alone, or in combination with any existing anti-obesity agent as described by Flint, A.; Raben, A.; Astrup, A.; Hoist, J. J. in J. Clin. Invest. 1998, 101, 515-520 or by Toft-Nielsen, M.-B.; Madsbad, S.; Hoist, J. J. in Diabetes Care 1999,22,1137-1143. Agents which can be used in combination with the compounds of the present invention include, but are not limited to fatty acid uptake inhibitors such as orlistat and the like, monoamine reuptake inhibitors such as sibutramine and the like, anorectic agents such as dexfenfluramine, bromocryptine, and the like, sympathomimetics such as phentennine, phendimetrazine, mazindol, and the like, thyromimetic agents, or other such anti-obesity agents that are known to one skilled in the art.<br>
DPP- IV is expressed on a fraction of resting T cells at low density but is strongly upregulated following T-cell activation. DPP-IV can have important functions on T cells and in the immune system. Synthetic inhibitors of the enzymatic activity of CD26 have been shown to suppress certain immune reactions in vitro and in vivo. In vitro recombinant soluble DPP-IV enhances proliferative responses of peripheral blood lymphocytes to stimulation with soluble tetanus toxoid antigen. In addition, the enhancing effect requires DPP-IV enzyme activity (Tanaka, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sd. 1994, 91, 3082-86; Tanaka, et al, Proc. Natl. 'Acad. Sci. 1993, 90, 4583). Soluble DPP-IV up-regulates the expression of the costimulatory molecule CD86 on monocytes through its dipeptidyl peptidase IV activity suggesting that soluble DPP-IV enhances T cell immune response to recall antigen via its direct effect on antigen presenting cells (Ohnuma, et al., J. Immunol. 2001,167(12), 6745-55). Consequently, DPP-IV inhibition would be predicted to suppress certain immune responses and thus have therapeutic benefit in the treatment of immunornodulatory diseases. Therefore, the compounds of the present invention, including but not limited to Ihose specified in the examples can be used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, scleraderma, chronic inflammatory bowel disease or syndrome and aliograft rejection in transplantation.<br>
Chemokine receptors, especially CCR5 and CXCR4, act as cofactors for HTV-1 entry into CD4+ cells and their corresponding ligands can suppress HIV entry and thus replication. The CXC chemokine, stromal cell derived factor-1 (SDF-1) is a chemokine for resting T-lymphocytes and monocytes. SDF-1 exists as two splice variants, SDF-1 alpha and SDF-Ibeta that differ by four additional C-tenninal residues in SDF-lbeta. Truncation of the N-<br>
terminal Lys-Pro- residues from both SDF-1 alpha and SDF-1 beta results in the loss of their chemotactic and antiviral activities in vitro (OhtsuM, et al, FEES Lett. 1998, 431, 236-40; Shioda, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1998, 95(11), 6331-6; Proost, et al., FEES Lett. 1998, 432, 73-6). DPP-IV inactivates SDF-1 alpha as a ligand for CXCR4 mat is a T cell chemotactic receptor as well as the major co-receptor for T-tropic HIV-1 strains. DPP-IV inhibition would be predicted to increase full-length SDF-1 levels and thereby suppress HIV-1 entry into CXCR4+ cells. Therefore, the compounds of the present invention, including but not limited to those specified in the examples can be used in the treatment of HTV infection (AIDS).<br>
Dipeptidyl-peptidase IV (DPPIV, EC 3.4.14.5; CD26) is a post-proline cleaving serine protease with significant homology to other alpha-beta hydroxy'ises (e.g. prolyl oligopeptidase). DPPIV is found throughout the body, both circulating in plasma and as a type n membrane protein produced by a variety of tissues, including kidney, liver and intestine. DPPIV plays a role in the cleavage of specific substrates with accessible amino-terminal Xaa-Pro- or Xaa-Ala- dipeptide sequences, resulting in their inactivation or alteration in their biological activities. Important DPPIV substrates include growth hormone releasing hormone, glucagon-like peptides (GLP)-1 and 2, gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) and certain chemokines like RANTES (regulated on activation,, normal T ceil expressed and secreted), stromal cell-derived factor, eotaxin, and macrophage-derived chemokine (Mentlein, R Regulatory Peptides, 1999,85, 9-24). The DPPIV substrate, glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1, is released from L cells in the distal small intestine and colon after oral ingestion of nutrients. The active GLP-1 (7-36) amide is an inc.c'stra that increases glucose stimulated insulin secretion (Drucker, D. J. Diabetes, 1998, 47, 159-169). Other activities attributed to GLP-1 (7-36) amide include stimulation of insulin gene expression, trophic effects on pancreatic beta cells, inhibition of glucagon secretion, promotion of satiety, inhibition of food intake, and slowing of gastric emptying (Drucker, D. J. Diabetes, 1998, 47, 159-169). These effects of GLP-1 (7-36) amide contribute to glucose homeostasis and the normalization of blood glucose levels in conditions of unpaired glucose tolerance. In this regard, GLP-1 (7-36) amide has been demonstrated to reduce postprandial and fastiug glycemia in patients with insulin-dependent and non-insulin-depcndent diabetes -mellitus (Nauck, et al., Hormone Metab. Res. 2002, 29,411-416; Gutniak et al., J. Internal Medicine, 2001, 250, 81-87; Rauchman, et al., Diabetohgia. 1997, 40, 205-11, Ahren, B., BioEssays<br>
1998,20,642-51). GLP-1 based therapy has therapeutic potential for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. However, active GLP-1 (7-36) amide is rapidly converted to GLP-1 (9-36) amide by DPPIV cleavage of the amino-terminal His-Ala- dipeptide of GLP-1 (7-36) amide (Mentlein, et al., Eur. J. Biochem. 1993, 214, 829-835). The resulting GLP-1 (9-36) amide is inactive and is an antagonist of the GLP-1 receptor (Knudson, et al., Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996,375,429-35).<br>
The short half-life of GLP-1 (7-36) amide in the circulation (1-1.5 minutes) makes it impractical as a therapeutic agent and has led to the development of alternative strategies to enhance the anti-diabetogenic activity of GLP-1. One strategy is to increase the circulating half-life of GLP-1, by inhibiting DPPIV activity (Deacon, et al., Diabetes 1995,44 1126-31). Inhibition of DPPIV in vivo increases the level of circulating GLP-1 (7-36) amide with a concomitant increase hi its insulinotropic effect (Deacon, et al., Diabetes. 1998, 47, 764-9). A DPPIV inhibitor has been demonstrated to improve glucose tolerance in non-insulin-dependeht diabetes mellitus (Ahren B, et al., Diabetes Care 2002, 25, 869-875). Therefore, the compounds of the present invention, including but not limited to those specified in the examples, can be used in the treatment of conditions caused by or associated with impaired glucose tolerance including the prevention or treatment of diabetes, especially non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia and metabolic syndrome (Johannsson, et al., J. Endocrinol. Invest. 1999,22(5 Suppl), 41-6).<br>
Striking similarities exist between the metabolic syndrome (syndrome X) and untreated growth hormone deficiency. Abdominal/visceral obesity and insulin resistance characterize both syndromes (Reaven, GM, Physiol. Rev. 1995, 75, 473-86; Johansson, et aJ,, Metabolism 1995, 44, 1126-29). Growth hormone favorably effects some of the perturbations associated with abdominal/visceral obesity, including reduction in abdominal/visceral obesity, improved insulin sensitivity and lipoprotein metabolism and reduction hi diastolic blood pressure (Barreto-Filho, et al., J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002, 87(5), 2018-23; Colao et al., J. Clin. Endocrinol Metab. 2002, 57(3), 1088-93; Gotherstrcm, et al., J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001, 56(10), 4657-65; Johannsson, et al., J. Endocrinol. Invest. 1999,22(5 Suppl), 41-6; Johannsson, et al., J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1997, 52(3), 727-34). DPPIV-mediated proteolysis has been established as a major route of growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH) degradation and inactivation (Kubiak, et al.. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1989, 17, 393-7). GHRH-derivatives that are resistant to DPPIV cleavage<br>
are more potent in increasing serum growth hormone levels when administered i.v. due to longer stability in vivo. DPPIV inhibition would be predicted to increase GHRH levels and thus serum growth hormone levels. Therefore, the compounds of the present invention, including but not limited to those specified in the examples, can be used in the treatment of conditions associated with deficiency in growth hormone including metabolic disorders (central obesity, dyslipidemia), osteoporosis and frailty of aging.<br>
For the treatment of diabetes or metabolic syndrome, compounds of the present invention can be used alone, or in combination with any existing anti-diabetic agent. Agents which can be used in combination with the compounds of the present invention include, but are not limited to, insulin, an insulin analog such as mecasermin and the like, an insulin secretagogue such as nateglinide and the like, a biguanide such as metformin and the like, a sulfonylurea such as chlorpropamide, glipizide, glyburide, and the like, an insulin sensitizing agent such as a PPARy agonist such as troglitazone, pioglitazone, rosiglitazpne, and the like, an oc-glucosidase inhibitor such as acarbose, voglibose, miglitol and the like, an aldose reductase inhibitor such as zopolrestat and the like, a metiglinide such as repagliside and the like, a glycogen phosphorylase inhibitor, GLP-1 or a mimetic of GLP-1 such as exendin-4, or other such anti-diabetic agents that are known to one skilled in the art. The ability of the compounds of the present invention to treat diabetes, alone or in combination with another agent, can be demonstrated according to the methods described by Zander, M.; Mustafa, T.; Toft-Nielsen, M.-B.; Madsbad, S.; Hoist, J. J. in Diabetes Care 2001, 24, 720-725; or, according to the methods described herein.<br>
Diabetic dyslipidemia is characterized by multiple lipoprotein defects including moderately high serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides, small LDL particles and low levels of HDL cholesterol. The dyslipidemia associated with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus is improved hi conjunction with improved diabetic condition following treatment with GLP-1 (Junti-Berggren, et al, Diabetes Care 1996,19, 1200-6). DPPIV inhibition is predicted to increase the level of circulating GLP-1 (7-36) amide and thereby would be effective hi the treatment of diabetic dyslipidemia and associated complications. Therefore, the compounds of the present invention, including but not limited to those specified in the examples, can be used in the treatment hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia and associated cardiovascular disease. Parenteral injection of GLP-1 (7-36) amide in healthy men, obese men or patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes meliitus has been reported to<br>
promote satiety and to suppress food intake (Flint, et al., J. Clin. Invest. 1998,101, 515-520;<br>
Naslund, et al., Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1998, 68,525-530; Gutzwiller, et al., Am. J. Physiol. 1999,<br>
276, R1541-R1544.) DPPIV inhibition is predicted to increase the level of circulating GLP-1<br>
(7-36) amide and thereby increases satiety in obesity and non-insulin-dependent diabetes<br>
mellitus. Therefore, the compounds of the present invention, including but not limited to<br>
those specified in the examples, can be used in the treatment of obesity.	„<br>
For the treatment of obesity, compounds of the present invention can be used alone, or in combination with any existing anti-obesity agent as described by Flint, A; Raben, A.; Astrup, A.; Hoist, J. J. in J. Clin. Invest. 1998, 101, 515-520 or by Toft-Nielsen, M.-B.; Madsbad, S.; Hoist, J. J. in Diabetes Care 1999,22,1137-1143. Agents which can be used in combination with the compounds of the present invention include, but are not limited to, fatty acid uptake inhibitors such as orlistat and the like, monoamine reuptake inhibitors such as sibutramine and the like, anorectic agents such as dexfenfluramine, bromocryptine, and Ihe like, sympathomimetics such as phentermine, phendimetrazine, mazindol, and the like, thyromimetic agents, or other such anti-obesity agents that are known to one skilled in the art.<br>
DPPIV is expressed on a fraction of resting T cells at low density, but is strongly upregulated following T-cell activation. DPPIV can have important functions on T cells and in the immune system. Synthetic inhibitors of the enzymatic activity of CD26 have been shown to suppress certain immune reactions in vitro and in vivo. In viiro recombinant soluble DPPIV enhances proliferative responses of peripheral blood lymphocytes to stimulation with soluble tetanus toxoid antigen. In addition, the enhancing effect requires DPPIV enzyme activity (Tanaka, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1994, 91, 3082-86; Tanaka, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1993, 90,4583). Soluble DPPIV up-regulates the expression of the rostimulatory molecule CD86 on monocytes through its dipeptidyl peptidase IV activity suggesting that soluble DPPIV enhances T cell immune response to recall antigen via its direct effect on antigen presenting cells (Ohnuma, et al., J. Immunol. 2001, 167(12), 6745-55). Consequently, DPPIV inhibition would be predicted to suppress certain immune responses and thus have therapeutic benefit in the treatment of irnmunomodulatory diseases. Therefore, the compounds of the present invention, including but not limited-to those specified in the examples, can be used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.. multiple Dolero'ns, scleraderma, chronic inflammatory bowel disease or syndrome and aLograft rejection in transplantation.<br>
Chemokine receptors, especially CCR5 and CXCR4, act as cofactors for HIV-1 entry into CD4+ cells and their corresponding ligands can suppress HIV entry and thus replication. The CXC chemokine, stromal cell derived factor-1 (SDF-1) is a chemokine for resting T-lymphocytes and monocytes. SDF-1 exists as two splice variants, SDF-lalpha and SDF-Ibeta that differ by four additional C-terminal residues in SDF-lbeta. Truncation of the N-terminal Lys-Pro- residues from both SDF-1 alpha and SDF-1 beta results in the loss of their chemotactic and antiviral activities in vitro (Ohtsuki, et al, FEES Lett. 1998, 431, 236-40; Shioda, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1998,95(11), 6331-6; Proost, et zl, FEES Lett. 1998, 432. 73-6). DPPIV inactivates SDF-1 alpha as a ligand for CXCR4 that is a T cell chemotactic receptor as well as the major co-receptor for T-tropic HT/-1 strains. DPPIV inhibition would be predicted to increase full-length SDF-1 levels and thereby suppress HIV-1 entry into CXCR4+ cells. Therefore, the compounds of the present invention, including but not limited to those specified in the examples, can be used in the treatment of HIV infection (AIDS).<br>
The loss of DPPIV activity in DPPIV-deficient F344 rats is associated with reduced stress-like responses in tasks such as the open field, social interaction and passive avoidance tests compared to wild-type animals (Karl, et al., Physiology and Behavior 2003, 80, 123-134). Consequently, inhibition of DPPIV activity is predicted to be anxiolytic. DPPIV inhibitors are efficacious in established models of psychosis including mescaline-induced scratching and amphetamine-induced hyperactivity models (Lautar, et al., Brain Research 2005,1048, 177-184). Therefore, the compounds of the present invention, including but not limited to those specified in the examples, can be used in the treatment of anxiety, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depression.<br>
Porphyromonas gingivalis is a pathogen associated with adult peridontitis. P. gingivalis produces dipeptidyl peptidase IV, which acts as a virulence factor by contributing to the degradation of connective tissue and thus having a pathological role in the progression of periodontitis (Kumagai, et al., Infection and Immunity 2005, 73,2655-2664). The catalytic pocket is identical between human DPPIV and P. gingvalis DPPIV. Thus, DPPIV inhibitors designed against human DPPIV are highly likely to inhibit P. gingvalis DPPIV. Therefore, the compounds of the present invention, including but not limited to those specified in the examples, can be used in the treatment of adult peridontitis.<br>
In addition to GLP-1, GLP-2 is also secreted from endocrine L ceils in response to<br>
nutrient intake. GLP-2 acts to slow gastric emptying, reduce gastric secretions, increase intestinal blood flow and stimulate the growth of the small and large intestine (Jeppesen, PB, et al., Gut 2005, 54, 1224-1231). GLP-2 promotes nutrient absorption by expansion of the mucosal epithelium in the small and large bowel by stimulation of crypt cell proliferation and inhibition of enterocyte apoptosis (Drucker, DJ, et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci, 1996, 93, 7911-7916). GLP-2 improves intestinal wound healing (Bulut, K, et al., Regulatory Peptides, 2004, 121, 137-143) and improves intestinal function in short bowel syndrome patients (Jeppesen, PB, et al., Gut 2005, 54, 1224-1231). Like GLP-1, GLP-2 is degraded by the action of DPPIV. Consequently, agents that inhibit DPPIV activity would be predicted to elevate levels of active GLP-2. Therefore, the compounds of the present invention, including but not limited to those specified in the examples, can be used in the treatment of gastrointestinal diseases and disorders including short bowel syndrome and to improve nutrient uptake in the frail and elderly.<br>
DPP-IV is a member of a family of dipeptidyl peptidases that share significant sequence homology. It has been suggested (Lankas, et al., Diabetes 2005, 54, 2988-2994) that selectivity can play a significant role in determining the safety profile of DPP-IV inhibitors. In particular, these workers have demonstrated that inhibitors of DPP8 and DPP9 demonstrate substantial toxicity in several preclinical toxicology models. Compounds of the present invention are highly selective for DPP-IV over DPP8 and DPP9, as demonstrated below:<br>

An additional 100 mL of 4N HC1 in dioxane was added after thirty minutes. After 1.5 hours, the mixture was concentrated in vacua. The resulting solid was dissolved in a minimum amount of MeOH (approximately 4 L), and this solution was slowly poured into Et20 (20L) with stirring. The precipitate was collected by filtration, washed with 0.7 L of EtOAc, 0.5 L of Et2O and then dried in vacua at 45° C to give 220 g of the HC1 salt. This material was dissolved in 2.2L of water, and stirred efficiently as lOOg of NaHCOa was added cautiously (gas evolves). The mixture was extracted with 1L of EtOAc; 50g of NaCl was added, and the solution was extracted twice with 200 mL of EtOAc. The combined organics were washed with brine, dried over Na2SO4, and concentrated in vacuo to give a slightly-yellow foam. This material was dissolved in 500 mL of EtOH. This solution was stirred while a solution of 86 g of p-toluenesulfonic acid in 200 mL of EtOH was added. The resultant mixture was seeded and stirred at room temperature for four hours. The resultant solid was collected by filtration and washed with EtOH. The combined filtrates were concentrated to one-half volume, stirred for two hours, and filtered to collect a second crop of solid, which was washed with EtOH. The process was repeated to give a third crop of solid. The solids were combined and dried overnight in a vacuum oven at a temperature of 40° C. The overall yield of solid is 250.7 g (82%).<br>
