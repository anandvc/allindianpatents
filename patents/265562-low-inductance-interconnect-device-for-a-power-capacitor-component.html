				<td>LOW INDUCTANCE INTERCONNECT DEVICE FOR A POWER<br>
CAPACITOR COMPONENT<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] Embodiments of the subject matter described herein relate<br>
generally to interconnect devices for establishing electrical connections, and<br>
more particularly, embodiments of the subject matter relate to capacitor<br>
segments configured for low inductance by overlapping bus bars carrying<br>
current in opposing directions.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] Capacitors are used in many power circuits or electrical systems to<br>
smooth voltage and/or current from one device or component to other devices<br>
or components. Often, one or more capacitors are connected in parallel<br>
between the electrical devices or components. The capacitor reduces current<br>
ripple during operation of the electrical system, for example, by compensating<br>
for an inductive load or absorbing voltage fluctuations or spikes caused by one<br>
of the devices. As the power rating (e.g., voltage level or current level) of the<br>
electrical system increases, more capacitance is often needed, which generally<br>
requires capacitors having increased volume.<br>
[0003] In higher power applications, typically one or more bus bars are<br>
used to connect the capacitors to the electrical system. Often, these bus bars<br>
are flat sheets of an electrically conductive material, such as copper or<br>
aluminum. In order to accommodate higher power ratings and larger<br>
capacitors, the bus bars must also have a larger size. As a result of increasing<br>
the size of the bus bars, the inductance of bus bars increases. This added<br>
inductance has a negative impact on the electrical system and counteracts the<br>
capacitor. In switching applications where the current changes at a high rate<br><br>
with respect to time, the added inductance can cause voltage spikes, which<br>
may reduce reliability of the other components in the electrical system.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY<br>
[0004] An apparatus is provided for a capacitor segment for use with a<br>
power module in a vehicle. The capacitor segment comprises an inner<br>
conductor configured to receive a first potential. The inner conductor has a<br>
generally L-shaped longitudinal cross-section. An outer conductor is<br>
configured to receive a second potential, and is electrically insulated from the<br>
inner conductor. The outer conductor comprises a first section having a<br>
generally L-shaped longitudinal cross-section aligned with the inner<br>
conductor, and a second section coupled to the first section, the second section<br>
having a generally L-shaped lateral cross-section. The second section and the<br>
inner conductor define an inner region. A capacitor is located in the inner<br>
region and coupled to the inner conductor and the second section. The<br>
capacitor segment is configured such that current flows through the capacitor<br>
in a first direction, and current flows through the second section in a second<br>
direction that generally opposes the first direction.<br>
[0005] An apparatus is provided for an electrical device. The electrical<br>
device comprises an inner conductor having a generally L-shaped longitudinal<br>
cross-section. An outer conductor is physically coupled to, and electrically<br>
insulated from, the inner conductor. The outer conductor comprises a first<br>
section having a generally L-shaped longitudinal cross-section that generally<br>
conforms to the inner conductor, and a second section coupled to the first<br>
section. The second section has a generally L-shaped lateral cross-section,<br>
wherein the second section and the inner conductor define an inner region<br>
adapted to receive at least one capacitor element.<br>
[0006] An apparatus for an electrical system is provided. The electrical<br>
system comprises a first bus bar, which is electrically conductive, substantially<br>
planar, and configured to receive a first potential. The electrical system<br>
further comprises  a  second bus bar,  which  is  electrically  conductive,<br><br>
substantially planar, and configured to receive a second potential. A dielectric<br>
material is located between the first bus bar and the second bus bar, such that<br>
the dielectric material electrically insulates the first bus bar from the second<br>
bus bar. A capacitor is coupled to the first bus bar and the second bus bar,<br>
wherein the first bus bar and the second bus bar are configured such that<br>
current flows through the first bus bar in a first direction, and current flows<br>
through the second bus bar in a second direction that generally opposes the<br>
first direction.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0015] The following detailed description is merely illustrative in nature<br>
and is not intended to limit the embodiments of the subject matter or the<br>
application and uses of such embodiments. As used herein, the word<br>
"exemplary" means "serving as an example, instance, or illustration." Any<br>
implementation described herein as exemplary is not necessarily to be<br>
construed as preferred or advantageous over other implementations.<br>
Furthermore, there is no intention to be bound by any expressed or implied<br>
theory presented in the preceding technical field, background, brief summary<br>
or the following detailed description.<br>
[0016] The following description refers to elements or nodes or features<br>
being "connected" or "coupled" together. As used herein, unless expressly<br>
stated otherwise, "connected" means that one element/node/feature is directly<br>
joined to (or directly communicates with) another element/node/feature, and<br>
not necessarily mechanically. Likewise, unless expressly stated otherwise,<br>
"coupled" means that one element/node/feature is directly or indirectly joined<br>
to (or directly or indirectly communicates with) another element/node/feature,<br>
and not necessarily mechanically. Thus, although the schematics and<br>
diagrams shown herein depict exemplary arrangements of elements, additional<br>
intervening elements, devices, features, or components may be present in an<br>
embodiment of the depicted subject matter.<br>
[0017] In addition, certain terminology may also be used in the following<br>
description for the purpose of reference only, and thus are not intended to be<br>
limiting. For example, terms such as "inner" and "outer" describe the<br>
orientation and/or location of portions of the component within a consistent<br>
but arbitrary frame of reference which is made clear by reference to the text<br>
and the associated drawings describing the component under discussion. Such<br>
terminology may include the words specifically mentioned above, derivatives<br>
thereof, and words of similar import. Similarly, the terms "first", "second"<br>
and other such numerical terms referring to structures do not imply a sequence<br>
or order unless clearly indicated by the context.<br><br>
[0018] For the sake of brevity, conventional techniques related to<br>
soldering, packaging, and other functional aspects of the systems (and the<br>
individual operating components of the systems) may not be described in<br>
detail herein. Furthermore, the connecting lines shown in the various figures<br>
contained herein are intended to represent exemplary functional relationships<br>
and/or physical couplings between the various elements. It should be noted<br>
that many alternative or additional functional relationships or physical<br>
connections may be present in an embodiment of the subject matter.<br>
[0019] Technologies and concepts described herein relate generally to<br>
interconnect devices for coupling capacitors to electrical systems using bus<br>
bars. The bus bars are arranged in a manner that reduces the total inductance<br>
of the interconnect device.<br>
[0020] Referring now to FIG. 1, in an exemplary embodiment, an<br>
electrical system 100 includes, without limitation, an energy source 102, an<br>
electrical load 104, and a capacitor bank 106. The elements of electrical<br>
system 100 may be interconnected together using a bus 108 or another suitable<br>
interconnection arrangement. In an exemplary embodiment, the electrical<br>
system 100 may be located within a vehicle 110, however, in practical<br>
embodiments, the topology and configuration of the electrical system 100 can<br>
vary to suit the needs of the particular application and FIG. 1 is not intended to<br>
limit the application or scope of the subject matter in any way. It should be<br>
understood that FIG. 1 is a simplified representation of an electrical system<br>
100 for purposes of explanation and ease of description, and that practical<br>
embodiments will include numerous other devices and components to provide<br>
additional functions and features, as will be understood.<br>
[0021] Depending on the embodiment, the vehicle 110 may be any one of<br>
a number of different types of automobiles, such as, for example, a sedan, a<br>
wagon, a truck, or a sport utility vehicle (SUV), and may be two-wheel drive<br>
(2WD) (i.e., rear-wheel drive or front-wheel drive), four-wheel drive (4WD),<br>
or all-wheel drive (AWD). The vehicle 110 may also incorporate any one of,<br>
or combination of, a number of different types of engines, such as, for<br><br>
example, a gasoline or diesel fueled combustion engine, a "flex fuel vehicle"<br>
(FFV) engine (i.e., using a mixture of gasoline and alcohol), a fuel cell vehicle<br>
engine, a gaseous compound (e.g., hydrogen and natural gas) fueled engine, a<br>
combustion/electric motor hybrid engine, or an electric motor. In this regard,<br>
energy source 102 may be realized as a battery, a fuel cell, or another suitable<br>
voltage source. In an exemplary embodiment, the energy source 102 provides<br>
DC electrical energy to the electrical system 100.<br>
[0022] In various embodiments, the electrical load 104 may be realized as<br>
a power module (e.g., an inverter, a DC-to-DC converter), an inductive load,<br>
or another suitable electrical device or component. In an exemplary<br>
embodiment, the electrical load 104 is an inverter power module configured to<br>
utilize high-frequency pulse width modulation (PWM) techniques to convert<br>
DC power from the energy source 102 and provide AC power to a motor or<br>
another device within the vehicle 110, as will be understood.<br>
[0023] In an exemplary embodiment, the capacitor bank 106 comprises<br>
one or more capacitors or other capacitive elements, which may be configured<br>
electrically in series or parallel. In an exemplary embodiment, the capacitor<br>
bank 106 is realized as a plurality of capacitors configured electrically in<br>
parallel. In practice, the total capacitance of the capacitor bank 106 will vary<br>
according to the needs of a given electrical system 100, as will be understood.<br>
When used in a vehicle 110 with an inverter power module, the capacitance of<br>
the capacitor bank 106 generally ranges from 300 to 2000 microfarad.<br>
[0024] In an exemplary embodiment, the bus 108 may be realized as a pair<br>
of bus bars. Depending on the embodiment, each of the bus bars may be<br>
realized as a sheet or plate of copper or another conductive material. In<br>
accordance with one embodiment, a first of the bus bars is coupled to and/or<br>
configured to receive a positive voltage potential from the energy source 102<br>
(e.g., the supply conductor), and a second bus bar is coupled to and/or<br>
configured to receive a negative voltage potential from the energy source 102<br>
(e.g., the return conductor). In an exemplary embodiment, the bus bars are<br>
sized to allow coupling to the capacitor bank 106, and also to accommodate<br><br>
the power rating (or current rating) of the electrical system 100. The bus bars<br>
may be packaged together or located near each other to achieve space savings.<br>
For example, the bus bars may be arranged to accommodate a vehicle 110<br>
form factor (e.g., for packaging under the hood of an automobile). In an<br>
exemplary embodiment, the bus bars are separated by an insulating layer,<br>
which electrically insulates the bus bars. In an exemplary embodiment, the<br>
insulating layer is realized as a dielectric material, such as polyethylene<br>
naphthalate (PEN), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyimide film, or<br>
another suitable material.<br>
[0025] In an exemplary embodiment, the bus bars have an inductance (L)<br>
by virtue of their geometry and spatial relationship by virtue of Faraday's law<br>
of induction, as will be appreciated in the art. For the exemplary embodiment<br>
shown, the inductance is governed by the relationship L = k—, where k is a<br>
b<br>
constant based on the conductive material, I is the length of the bus bar<br>
measured in the direction of current flow, b is the width of the bus bar, and a<br>
is the distance between conductors (e.g., the thickness of the insulating layer<br>
between two bus bars).  By virtue of this inductance, varying or fluctuating<br>
current (e.g., increased magnitude of —) induces a voltage (V = L—) into<br>
dt	dt<br>
the electrical system 100, as will be appreciated in the art. In an exemplary<br>
embodiment, each individual bus bar has a respective inductance, which may<br>
be summed to determine a total inductance for the bus 108, as will be<br>
appreciated in the art.<br>
[0026] Referring now to FIGS. 2-5, in an exemplary embodiment, a<br>
capacitor segment 200 includes an outer bus bar 202, an inner bus bar 204, a<br>
dielectric material 206, and at least one capacitor element 208. The three-<br>
dimensional (x-y-z) reference coordinates shown in FIGS. 2-5 are used for<br>
illustrative purposes and for ease of description. The bus bars 202, 204 may<br>
include terminals 203, 205 configured to receive a voltage potential and/or<br>
current for coupling the capacitor segment 200 to one or more circuit<br><br>
elements. It should be understood that although the capacitor segment 200<br>
may be referred to herein as having a single capacitor element 208 for ease of<br>
description, in practice, any number of capacitor elements may be present to<br>
suit the needs of a particular application and FIG. 2 is not intended to limit the<br>
application or scope of the subject matter in any way.<br>
[0027] In an exemplary embodiment, the dielectric material 206 is capable<br>
of providing electrical isolation between the two bus bars 202, 204.<br>
Moreover, the dielectric material 206 may be configured to physically couple<br>
the outer bus bar 202 and the inner bus bar 204, as described below. In an<br>
exemplary embodiment, the outer bus bar 202 includes a section (e.g., section<br>
212) that generally conforms to at least a portion of the inner bus bar 204 (e.g.,<br>
section 224), as described in greater detail below. The inner bus bar 204 and<br>
outer bus bar 202 define an inner region 210 that is suitably sized and shaped<br>
to receive the capacitor element 208. The capacitor element 208 is located in<br>
the inner region 210, and is coupled to each bus bar 202, 204, as described in<br>
greater detail below.<br>
[0028] Referring now to FIG. 3, and with continued reference to FIG. 2, in<br>
an exemplary embodiment, the outer bus bar 202 (or outer conductor) is<br>
electrically conductive and configured to receive a voltage potential (e.g., via<br>
terminal 203). In accordance with one embodiment, the outer bus bar 202 is<br>
configured to be coupled to a positive voltage potential (e.g., coupled to a<br>
positive terminal of energy source 102). In an exemplary embodiment, the<br>
outer bus bar 202 comprises a first section 212 having a generally L-shaped<br>
longitudinal cross-section (e.g., along the x-y plane) including a first planar<br>
segment 216 coupled to a second planar segment 218. In one embodiment,<br>
terminal 203 is integral with and/or coupled to the first planar segment 216 for<br>
receiving a voltage as shown. The outer bus bar 202 also comprises a second<br>
section 214 having a generally L-shaped lateral cross-section (e.g., along the<br>
x-z plane) including a third planar segment 220 coupled to a fourth planar<br>
segment 222. It should be understood that as used herein, planar segment<br>
refers to an element or segment that is substantially planar with some<br><br>
thickness (e.g., a planar segment may be three-dimensional). Furthermore, the<br>
embodiment shown is merely one preferred embodiment, and in practice, the<br>
bus bar segments may have various shapes and sizes, and they need not be<br>
planar. In an exemplary embodiment, the fourth planar segment 222 is<br>
configured to be coupled to one or more capacitor elements 208, as described<br>
in greater detail below.<br>
[0029] In the exemplary embodiment shown in FIG. 2 and FIG. 3, the<br>
second planar segment 218 and the fourth planar segment 222 are substantially<br>
parallel to each other (e.g., both substantially parallel to the y-z plane), and<br>
substantially perpendicular to the third planar segment 220 (e.g., the third<br>
planar segment 220 is substantially parallel to the x-y plane). In accordance<br>
with one embodiment, the first planar segment 216 may be substantially<br>
perpendicular to the second planar segment 218 (e.g., substantially parallel to<br>
the x-z plane). In an exemplary embodiment, the outer bus bar 202 is realized<br>
as a continuous body by joining, physically coupling, or otherwise integrating<br>
planar segments 216, 218, 220, 222. In accordance with one exemplary<br>
manufacturing process, the outer bus bar 202 is formed from a single sheet or<br>
plate of copper. It should be appreciated that although the segments 216, 218,<br>
220, 222 of the outer bus bar 202 are shown to intersect at approximately right<br>
angles, in practice, the angles of intersection may vary depending upon the<br>
shape and size of the capacitor element 208 and the required form factor of the<br>
capacitor segment 200.<br>
[0030] In an exemplary embodiment, the inner bus bar 204 or conductor is<br>
electrically conductive and configured to receive a voltage potential (e.g., via<br>
terminal 205). In accordance with one embodiment, the inner bus bar 204 is<br>
configured to be coupled to negative voltage potential (e.g., coupled to a<br>
negative terminal of energy source 102). The inner bus bar 204 comprises a<br>
section 224 having a generally L-shaped longitudinal cross-section (e.g., along<br>
the x-y plane) including a fifth planar segment 226 coupled to a sixth planar<br>
segment 228.   In accordance with one embodiment, terminal 205 is integral<br><br>
with and/or coupled to the fifth planar segment 226 for receiving a voltage as<br>
shown.<br>
[0031] When assembled together, the fifth planar segment 226 and the<br>
sixth planar segment 228 are aligned with the first section 212 of the outer bus<br>
bar 202. In such an embodiment, the fifth planar segment 226 is substantially<br>
parallel to first planar segment 216 and the sixth planar segment 228 is<br>
substantially parallel to second planar segment 218. In an exemplary<br>
embodiment, the inner bus bar 204 is realized as a continuous body by joining,<br>
physically coupling, or otherwise integrating planar segments 226 and 228. In<br>
accordance with one exemplary manufacturing process, the inner bus bar 204<br>
is formed from a single sheet or plate of copper. It should be appreciated that<br>
although the segments 226, 228 of the inner bus bar 204 are shown to intersect<br>
at an approximately right angle (e.g., substantially perpendicular), that in<br>
practice the angle of intersection may vary depending upon the shape and size<br>
of the capacitor element 208 and the required form factor of the capacitor<br>
segment 200.<br>
[0032] Referring again to FIG. 2 and FIG. 3, in an exemplary<br>
embodiment, the inner bus bar 204 and the outer bus bar 202 are generally<br>
conforming and physically coupled to each other such that they define an inner<br>
region 210. In an exemplary embodiment, the dielectric material 206 (not<br>
shown in FIG. 3) is realized as a thin sheet or film of polyethylene naphthalate<br>
that is lined on its exterior surfaces with an adhesive. The bus bars 202, 204<br>
may be joined or affixed by placing the dielectric material 206 between them<br>
and pressing the bus bars 202, 204 together. In this regard, the respective bus<br>
bars 202, 204 may have cutout regions 230 (and the dielectric material 206<br>
may have corresponding cutout regions), for example, to allow terminals 203,<br>
205 of the other bus bar 202, 204 to protrude through or otherwise be<br>
electrically isolated from the respective bus bar 202, 204.<br>
[0033] In an exemplary embodiment, the capacitor element 208 is a<br>
surface mountable capacitor having a body 232 with surface terminals 234,<br>
236 on opposing sides of the body 232.    A first surface terminal 234 is<br><br>
configured to receive a positive voltage potential, and a second surface<br>
terminal 236 is configured to receive a negative voltage potential. The first<br>
surface terminal 234 may be coupled to the outer bus bar 202 (e.g., fourth<br>
planar segment 222) and the second surface terminal 236 may be coupled to<br>
the inner bus bar 204 (e.g., sixth planar segment 228), such that the capacitor<br>
element 208 is located within the inner region 210. For example, the bus bars<br>
202, 204 may include one or more finger-shaped regions 238 on the respective<br>
planar segments 222, 228 for soldering the capacitor element 208 to the bus<br>
bars 202, 204. As shown, the finger-shaped regions 238 are protrusions<br>
formed in the conductive material of the bus bar by cutting out the<br>
surrounding material, which are suitably sized for soldering. Current flows<br>
through the finger-shaped regions 238 in a direction away from the gap of<br>
conductive material (e.g., away from the solder joint and through the<br>
conductor), as will be appreciated in the art. The outer bus bar 202 may<br>
include cutout regions 230 aligned with the finger-shaped regions 238 of the<br>
inner bus bar 204 to allow access for soldering and to provide electrical<br>
isolation, as will be appreciated in the art. In accordance with one<br>
embodiment, the finger-shaped regions 238 are oriented to facilitate current<br>
flow in a particular direction, as described in greater detail below.<br>
[0034] Referring now to FIG. 3, FIG. 4, and FIG. 5, and with continued<br>
reference to FIG. 2, in an exemplary embodiment, the capacitor segment 200<br>
is configured to reduce the inductance of the bus bars 202,204 by reducing the<br>
distance between elements that carry opposing currents (e.g., reducing a in the<br>
equation L = k —) and maximizing the overlap of elements with opposing<br>
b<br>
currents (e.g., increasing b in the equation L = k—). It should be understood<br>
b<br>
that although current may be described herein as flowing primarily in a<br>
particular direction, in reality, current does not travel uniformly throughout a<br>
device, element, or conductor.    In this regard, current will be distributed<br><br>
unevenly throughout the device, element, or conductor, but generally or<br>
predominantly flows in the indicated direction.<br>
[0035] For example, using the configuration as described above in the<br>
context of FIG. 2 and FIG. 3, assuming the outer bus bar 202 is coupled to a<br>
positive voltage and inner bus bar 204 is coupled to a negative voltage, current<br>
may flow through the body 232 of the capacitor element 208 in a generally<br>
positive direction along the x-axis. The capacitor segment 200 is configured<br>
such that current flows through a portion of the outer bus bar 202, e.g., third<br>
planar segment 220, and proximate the body 232 in a generally negative<br>
direction along the x-axis, thereby reducing the inductance of the third planar<br>
segment 220. In such a configuration, current flows through the fourth planar<br>
segment 222 in a generally negative direction along the z-axis. In accordance<br>
with one embodiment, finger-shaped regions 238 are oriented to facilitate<br>
current flow in the negative direction along the z-axis, as shown in FIG. 3.<br>
Accordingly, as a result of this configuration, current flows through the second<br>
planar segment 218 in a generally positive direction along the y-axis and<br>
current flows through the first planar segment 216 in a generally positive<br>
direction along the x-axis and from the outer bus bar 202 via terminal 203.<br>
[0036] In an exemplary embodiment, the inner bus bar 204 is configured<br>
such that current through a portion of the inner bus bar 204 is in a direction<br>
opposite current flow through a corresponding portion of the outer bus bar<br>
202. For example, the capacitor segment 200 is configured such that current<br>
flows into the inner bus bar 204 via terminal 205 and through the fifth planar<br>
segment 226 in a generally negative direction along the x-axis. In accordance<br>
with one embodiment, the fifth planar segment 226 may also be proximate the<br>
body 232, where current through the fifth planar segment 226 is in a direction<br>
opposite current through the capacitor element 208. Accordingly, current<br>
flows through the sixth planar segment 228 in a generally negative direction<br>
along the y-axis, which is opposite the direction of current through second<br>
planar segment 218.<br><br>
[0037] Referring now to FIG. 6, depending on the embodiment, one or<br>
more capacitor segments 600, 610 may be utilized to achieve a required<br>
capacitance and/or accommodate various spatial constraints or form factors.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment, the capacitor segments 600, 610 are rotated<br>
180° relative to one another, to achieve greater overlap of opposing currents<br>
and minimize the separation distance. For example, as shown, the capacitor<br>
segments 600, 610 are arranged such that the capacitor segments 600, 610 are<br>
adjacent, and the current through the adjacent planar segments are in opposing<br>
directions. Although not shown in FIG. 6, in a practical embodiment, a<br>
dielectric material may separate the capacitor segments 600, 610. It should be<br>
appreciated that any number of capacitor segments may be used and arranged<br>
in such an alternating configuration, or equivalents thereof, to achieve a<br>
desired capacitance or form factor while reducing the total inductance created<br>
by the bus bars 202,204.<br>
[0038] One advantage of the systems and apparatus described above is that<br>
the bus bar inductance is reduced, which reduces the voltage induced (e.g.,<br>
voltage spike) when used in switching applications, such as with a PWM<br>
inverter power module. By reducing induced voltage, the electrical stress on<br>
the electrical devices or components in the system caused by unwanted<br>
voltage spikes is reduced. For example, in the case of an inverter, reducing<br>
inductance (and thereby the induced voltage from switching) helps to ensure<br>
the voltage rating of the switches in the inverter is not exceeded by voltage<br>
spikes, and thus improves overall system reliability. Furthermore, capacitor<br>
interconnect devices may be segmented in design and scalable to achieve<br>
various capacitance values and sizes, and thereby accommodate capacitance<br>
and form factor requirements for a variety of electrical systems. Other<br>
embodiments may utilize system and method described above in different<br>
types of automobiles, different vehicles (e.g., watercraft and aircraft), or in<br>
different electrical systems altogether, as it may be implemented in any<br>
situation where a low inductance bus interconnect is desired.<br><br>
[0039] While at least one exemplary embodiment has been presented in<br>
the foregoing detailed description, it should be appreciated that a vast number<br>
of variations exist. It should also be appreciated that the exemplary<br>
embodiment or embodiments described herein are not intended to limit the<br>
scope, applicability, or configuration of the claimed subject matter in any way.<br>
Rather, the foregoing detailed description will provide those skilled in the art<br>
with a convenient road map for implementing the described embodiment or<br>
embodiments. It should be understood that various changes can be made in<br>
the function and arrangement of elements without departing from the scope<br>
defined by the claims, which includes known equivalents and foreseeable<br>
equivalents at the time of filing this patent application.<br><br>
