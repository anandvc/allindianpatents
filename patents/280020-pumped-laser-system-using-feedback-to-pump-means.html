				<td>Pumped laser system using feedback to pump means<br>
Technical Field<br>
The following invention relates to a laser system comprising pump generating means<br>
for generating at least a first and a second, preferably focused, pump beam, lasing<br>
means for emitting radiation by being appropriately pumped, said lasing means being<br>
disposed in a first resonator so as to receive the first pump beam in order to generate a<br>
first beam having a first frequency, and said lasing means being disposed in a second<br>
resonator so as to receive the second pump beam in order to generate a second beam<br>
having a second frequency, and at least one Q-switch being disposed in the first and<br>
the second resonator, so that the first beam and the second beam both pass a Q-<br>
switch, and said laser system having an output generated from said first beam and said<br>
second beam.<br>
Laser systems, which comprise two or more lasers or gain elements or alternatively a<br>
gain element generating two or more laser lines (i.e. two or more wavelengths), and in<br>
which a so-called sum frequency generation or another form of nonlinear conversion is<br>
involved, are a relatively new area of research. In order to achieve a more efficient con-<br>
version, the lasers can be pulsed. The individual lasers can be pulsed by pulsing a<br>
pump source (not that efficient) or they can be pulsed by periodically changing the so-<br>
called Q-factor of the cavity of the laser by modulating the losses in the cavity. This can<br>
be achieved by using a so-called Q-switch. The Q-switch can either be active, such as<br>
an electro-optical or acousto-optical Q-switch, or passive using a saturable absorber.<br>
One of the main problems of such systems is to synchronise the individual lasers since<br>
they usually have different pulse build-up times. Thereby, the pulses that propagate in<br>
the cavity will not temporally overlap. This is a problem, since the nonlinear conversion<br>
only can occur if the pulses overlap. If the overlap between the individual pulses is not<br>
in any way controlled or regulated, the overlap between the pulses will be random and<br>
therefore not optimised. Consequently, the nonlinear conversion will not be optimised<br>
either.<br>
One method for optimising the overlap is to regulate the focus of the emitted light from<br>
the pump source in the laser element. This is of course only possible in systems, where<br>
the light from the pump source is focused into the laser element. Thus, if the pump<br>
 <br>
source is a gas discharge lamp or a blitz lamp, it is not possible to use this type of<br>
regulation. In any case, it is difficult to change the focus of the pump source beam in<br>
commercial laser systems, since the functionality of the laser is highly dependent on an<br>
accurate focus. Furthermore, mechanical systems for changing the focal point have in-<br>
herent inaccuracies and will additionally considerably increase the overall cost of the<br>
laser system.<br>
Another method for regulating the pulse overlap relates to changing or translating one<br>
or more mirrors of the cavity in order to change the eigen-focus in the laser element.<br>
This changes the overlap between the cavity mode (i.e. the spot size in the laser ele-<br>
ment) and the pump source, whereby the gain of the laser element is changed. In addi-<br>
tion, the change in cavity mode itself can change the gain. Once again, this method is<br>
mechanically based and therefore involves a considerable increase to the overall cost<br>
of the system as well as introducing a source for misalignment.<br>
A third possibility is to change the position of the laser element with respect to the focal<br>
point of the pump source. However, this is only possible if the laser element is shorter<br>
than the cavity arm, in which the laser element is disposed. Additionally, it must be pos-<br>
sible to translate the laser element, which again means that mechanical translation<br>
means are necessary. Thus, this method has the same disadvantages as the afore-<br>
mentioned methods.<br>
A fourth possibility is to employ a method, where the cavities have static or variable, in-<br>
dividual losses so that the difference in intracavity losses outbalance the difference be-<br>
tween the respective gains of the laser elements.<br>
A fifth possibility is to utilise a plurality of Q-switches and a variable electronic delay be-<br>
tween them. This is a somewhat more complex solution, which demand for separate<br>
electrical supplies for the individual Q-switches as well as an electronic variable delay<br>
line. If the system operates in the nanosecond range, which is often the case for such<br>
systems, such electronics are relatively expensive and sensitive. Also, if every laser<br>
line of the system uses a separate Q-switch, this increases the overall cost of the sys-<br>
tem, since Q-switches generally are relatively expensive.<br>
US patent no. 5,121,402 discloses a multiple gain-element ring laser, which has the<br>
capability of being scaled to higher pulsed output powers. The ring laser comprises a<br>
 <br>
plurality of pump sources and corresponding gain elements. The resulting laser beams<br>
from the individual gain elements all pass the same Q-switch in the ring cavity.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
The purpose of the present invention is to provide a new and improved laser system, in<br>
which the pulse overlap between two or more laser lines of the system is optimisable.<br>
This is according to the invention achieved by at least a part of said output being fed<br>
back to a regulation system, which regulates the build-up time of individual laser pulses<br>
of the first and second beam by controlling the intensity output of said pump generating<br>
means.<br>
The regulation system is thereby adapted to control the intensity output of the pumping<br>
means, which in turn regulates the gain of the laser means, thereby controlling the<br>
build-up time of the individual laser pulses of said first and second beam. The overlap<br>
between the individual pulses can thereby be optimised in a simple manner.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, said at least one Q-switch is an active Q-<br>
switch, such as an electro-optical or an acousto-optical Q-switch. Active Q-switches are<br>
favourable as compared to passive Q-switches, since the latter only have a limited<br>
working interval with respect to the repetition frequency and the pulse effect. Therefore,<br>
typically an invariable working point has to be chosen.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, said at least one Q-switch is<br>
disposed in both the first resonator and the second resonator, so that the first beam<br>
and the second beam both pass the same Q-switch.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the pump means are a single pump source,<br>
such as a laser diode. This single pump source is thus used to generate at least said<br>
first and said second pump beam. In this case, it is possible to regulate the individual<br>
pump beam effect by use of methods known per se, such as by use of a phase re-<br>
tarder, a polarising beam splitter or a birefringent crystal.<br>
Alternatively, the pump means comprise at least a first pump source, such as a first la-<br>
ser diode, for generating the first pump beam, and a second pump source, such as a<br>
 <br>
second laser diode, for generating the second pump beam. Thereby, a particular sim-<br>
ple embodiment of the pump means is achieved.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment according to the invention, the lasing means is a<br>
single gain element or laser element. This single laser element is thus used to generate<br>
at least two pulsed laser beams having different frequencies or wavelengths.<br>
Alternatively, the lasing means comprise at least a first gain element or lasing element<br>
for generating said first beam, and a second gain element or laser element for generat-<br>
ing said second beam. Thereby, a particular simple embodiment of the lasing means is<br>
achieved, in which separate laser elements are used for generating the individual laser<br>
lines (or wavelengths) of the system.<br>
The laser system can of course comprise three, four or even more pump sources as<br>
well as three, four or more gain elements, the resulting laser system thus generating<br>
beams with three, four or more frequencies. The gain element(s) can for instance be a<br>
Nd:YAG or a Nd:YV04 crystal.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the first beam follows a first path<br>
in said first resonator, and the second beam follows a second path in said second<br>
resonator, and wherein at least a part of the first path and the second path are coincid-<br>
ing. In other words, said first resonator and said second resonator have a coinciding in-<br>
tracavity optical propagation axis. The first laser element and the second laser element<br>
can thus be positioned in the parts of the first cavity and second cavity, respectively,<br>
which are not coinciding.<br>
In an embodiment according to the invention, said first resonator and/or said second<br>
resonator are linear resonator cavities. In another embodiment according to the inven-<br>
tion, said first resonator and/or said second resonator are ring resonator cavities. Com-<br>
mon for all these embodiments is that the cavities usually comprise a plurality of mir-<br>
rors, one or more of these mirrors typically being common for all the resonator cavities.<br>
The cavity mirrors are preferably reflection coated to yield a high reflection coefficient<br>
for at least said first and said second frequency.<br>
 <br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the first resonator and the second resonator<br>
have a common output mirror. Said output mirror is typically antireflection coated to<br>
output the desired wavelength or wavelengths.<br>
According to a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, the laser system ad-<br>
ditionally comprises a nonlinear conversion element. The nonlinear conversion element<br>
can thus be used for inter alia sum frequency mixing or frequency difference mixing us-<br>
ing both the fundamental modes and the harmonics of the first and second beam, re-<br>
spectively. The conversion element can for instance be a periodically poled KTP crystal<br>
or another nonlinear optical element.<br>
According to an embodiment of the invention, the nonlinear conversion element is posi-<br>
tioned in the coinciding intracavity optical propagation axis. The conversion of the first<br>
and second beam can thus be achieved before being output through the common out-<br>
put mirror.<br>
According to an alternative embodiment, the nonlinear conversion element is posi-<br>
tioned after the common output mirror. In this case both the first beam and the second<br>
beam are output from the common output mirror and thus converted outside of their re-<br>
spective cavities. However, the nonlinear conversion element can also be positioned in<br>
the first cavity but outside the second cavity.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, at least a part of the output<br>
from the nonlinear conversion element is fed back to the regulation system. This yields<br>
a particular simple way to regulate the pump sources using the regulation system,<br>
since the output from the conversion element directly indicates the efficiency of the<br>
conversion and thereby also the degree of overlap between the pulses.<br>
The laser system can comprise two or more Q-switches, which for instance are posi-<br>
tioned in the parts of the cavities, which are not coinciding. This embodiment is particu-<br>
larly useful in systems, in which three or more laser beams are generated, or in sys-<br>
tems where the individual laser lines have a large wavelength difference.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the time difference between ac-<br>
tivation of said Q-switches is fixed. Alternatively, the time difference between activation<br>
of said Q-switches is variable.<br>
 <br>
In a preferred embodiment according to the invention, the output from the laser system<br>
is a nonlinear converted beam. The frequency of the converted beam is thus for in-<br>
stance the sum or the difference of the frequencies of the individual beams of the reso-<br>
nator cavities or their harmonics. It is for instance possible to use individual resonator<br>
laser beams lasing at 1064 nm and 1342 nm, respectively, in order to generate a yel-<br>
low-orange laser beam at 593 nm.<br>
According to another preferred embodiment of the invention, the output from the sys-<br>
tem has multiple laser lines or frequencies. These individual laser lines can for instance<br>
be the individual resonator laser beams, i.e. said first and said second beam. It is also<br>
possible to achieve a multi laserline output using the nonlinear conversion element. In<br>
the case using individual resonator laser beams lasing at 1064 nm and 1342 nm and<br>
further using the harmonics of these beams, it is possible to achieve individual output<br>
lines of 532 nm, 671 nm and 593 nm, i.e. green, red and yellow output.<br>
The system is usable for a wide range of applications. The laser system can for in-<br>
stance be used in particle image velocimetry (PIV) systems, which often utilise laser<br>
beams of different wavelengths. Similarly, the laser system can also be used for laser<br>
Doppler anemometry systems using two or more wavelengths.<br>
The laser system can also be used for inter alia RGB-displays, since the system can<br>
generate the individual laser lines needed for such displays.<br>
The laser system can also be used for generating solid state lasers with a yellow out-<br>
put. Yellow laser systems are today only found commercially on a very limited scale.<br>
One of the most promising areas of use for the system is in opto-medical applications,<br>
such as dermatology, photodynamic therapy and ophthalmology. Blood has a high ab-<br>
sorption coefficient for yellow light, and this can for instance be utilised for treatment of<br>
vascular related damages, such as port-wine stains, in acne treatment and skin rejuve-<br>
nation. Furthermore, the laser system can be used for photodynamic therapy, which is<br>
a promising method for treating skin cancer. The opto-medical applications mentioned<br>
are today often based on dye lasers. The laser system according to the invention can<br>
for instance generate yellow light with a pulse length in the nanosecond range with a<br>
repetition frequency in the kilohertz range and with an average effect of several watts.<br>
 <br>
The laser system is also applicable for laser isotope separation.<br>

Best Modes for Carrying out the Invention<br>
Fig. 1 shows a first embodiment of the laser system according to the invention. The la-<br>
ser system 101 comprises a first pump source 102 and a second pump source 103,<br>
preferably in form of a first laser diode and a second laser diode. The light emitted from<br>
the first pump source 102 is focused by a first condensing lens 104 and into a first gain<br>
element or laser element 106. When this laser element 106 is pumped, a laser pulse<br>
starts building up and is emitted from the laser element 106. A resulting emitted first la-<br>
 <br>
ser beam 121 having a first frequency is emitted in both directions in a first linear reso-<br>
nator cavity, which comprises three mirrors M11, M12 and M15. The three mirrors M11,<br>
M12 and M15 are preferably reflection coated in order to have high reflectance at the<br>
first frequency.<br>
Similarly, the light emitted from the second pump source 103 is focused by a second<br>
condensing lens 105 and into a second gain element or laser element 107. When the<br>
second laser element 107 is pumped, a laser pulse starts building up and is emitted<br>
from the laser element 107. A resulting emitted laser beam 122 is emitted in both direc-<br>
tions in a second linear resonator cavity, which comprises three mirrors M13, M14 and<br>
M15.<br>
The first resonator and the second resonator path have a coinciding beam path part<br>
between mirror M14 and M15. A Q-switch 108 and a nonlinear conversion element 109<br>
are positioned in this coinciding intracavity propagation path. The Q-switch 108 is pref-<br>
erably an active Q-switch, such as an electro-optical Q-switch or an acousto-optical Q-<br>
switch. The nonlinear conversion element 109 converts the first beam 121 and the<br>
second beam 122 by generating a converted beam having a frequency, which is the<br>
sum or the difference between the first frequency and the second frequency or the<br>
harmonics of the first and second frequencies. The output from the nonlinear conver-<br>
sion element 109 can also contain several laser lines, i.e. several beams of different<br>
wavelengths/frequencies.<br>
The converted light beam, and if desired also the first 121 and the second beam 122, is<br>
output through the common output mirror M15, which preferably is anti-reflection<br>
coated to output the desired wavelength of the converted beam. A feedback part 112 of<br>
the output 113 is fed back via a beam splitter 110 to for instance a photo diode or a<br>
power meter 111. The detected signal is processed by a regulation system or micro-<br>
processor 114, which controls the first pump source 102 and/or the second pump<br>
source 103. The pump sources 102, 103 in turn regulate the pulse build-up times for<br>
the laser elements 106 and 107, since the pulse build-up time is dependent on the in-<br>
tensity of the pump beam. Since the converted signal is a direct measure for the effi-<br>
ciency of the pulse overlap between the pulses of the first beam 121 and the second<br>
beam 122, the signal detected by the photo diode 111 can be used for regulating the<br>
intensity output of the first pump source 102 and/or the second pump source 103, and<br>
thereby the corresponding build-up times of the individual laser pulses. It is thereby<br>
 <br>
possible to optimise the pulse overlap between the pulses of the first beam 121 and the<br>
second beam 122 by varying the pump intensity and finding the maximum output of the<br>
feedback signal 112.<br>
The nonlinear conversion element 109 can also be positioned after the common output<br>
mirror M15. If the laser system for instance is a multiline laser system emitting laser<br>
beams of the first frequency and the second frequency only, the nonlinear conversion<br>
element 109 can be positioned in the path of the feedback beam 112, thereby only us-<br>
ing the nonlinear conversion element 109 for the feedback regulation.<br>
The first embodiment can also be modified so that it comprises two Q-switches, where<br>
a first Q-switch is positioned in the first resonator in the path between mirror M11 and<br>
M14, and a second Q-switch is positioned in the second resonator in the path between<br>
mirror M13 and M14. In this case, the Q-switches can be temporally synchronised, for<br>
instance if the difference in wavelengths between the first and second beam is rela-<br>
tively large.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a second embodiment of the laser system according to the invention, in<br>
which like reference numerals refer to like parts of the first embodiment. The laser sys-<br>
tem 201 comprises a first pump source 202 and a second pump source 203, preferably<br>
in form of a first laser diode and a second laser diode. The light emitted from the first<br>
pump source 202 is focused by a first condensing lens 204 and into a first gain element<br>
or laser element 206. When this laser element 206 is pumped, a laser pulse starts<br>
building up and is emitted from the laser element 206. A resulting emitted first laser<br>
beam 221 having a first frequency is emitted in both directions in a first ring resonator<br>
cavity, which comprises four mirrors M21, M22, M25 and M26. The four mirrors M21,<br>
M22, M25 and M26 are preferably reflection coated in order to have high reflectance at<br>
the first frequency.<br>
Similarly, the light emitted from the second pump source 203 is focused by a second<br>
condensing lens 205 and into a second gain element or laser element 207. When the<br>
second laser element 207 is pumped, a laser pulse starts building up and is emitted<br>
from the laser element 207. A resulting emitted laser beam 222 is emitted in both direc-<br>
tions in a second ring resonator cavity, which comprises four mirrors M23, M24, M25<br>
and M26.<br>
 <br>
The first resonator and the second resonator path have a coinciding beam path part<br>
from mirror M24 to M25 and then from M25 to M26 and on to M23. A Q-switch 208 and<br>
a nonlinear conversion element 209 are positioned in this coinciding intracavity propa-<br>
gation path. The Q-switch 208 is preferably an active Q-switch, such as an electro-<br>
optical Q-switch or an acousto-optical Q-switch. The nonlinear conversion element 209<br>
converts the first beam 221 and the second beam 222 by generating a converted beam<br>
having a frequency, which is the sum or the difference between the first frequency and<br>
the second frequency or the harmonics of the first and second frequencies. The output<br>
from the nonlinear conversion element 209 can also contain several laser lines, i.e.<br>
several beams of different wavelengths/frequencies.<br>
The converted light beam, and if desired also the first 221 and the second beam 222, is<br>
output through the common output mirrors M25 and M26, which are preferably anti-<br>
reflection coated to output the desired wavelength/frequencies. A feedback part 212 of<br>
a first output 213 is fed back via a beam splitter 210 to for instance a photo diode or a<br>
power meter 211. The detected signal is processed by a regulation system or micro-<br>
processor 214, which controls the first pump source 202 and/or the second pump<br>
source 203. The pump sources 202, 203 in turn regulate the pulse build-up times for<br>
the laser elements 206 and 207, since the pulse build-up time is dependent on the in-<br>
tensity of the pump light. Since the converted signal is a direct measure for the effi-<br>
ciency of the pulse overlap between the pulses of the first beam 221 and the second<br>
beam 222, the signal detected by the photo diode 211 can be used for regulating the<br>
intensity output of the first pump source 202 and/or the second pump source 203, and<br>
thereby the corresponding build-up times of the individual laser pulses. It is thereby<br>
possible to optimise the pulse overlap between the pulses of the first beam 221 and the<br>
second beam 222 by varying the pump intensity and finding the maximum output of the<br>
feedback signal 212.<br>
The nonlinear conversion element 209 can also be positioned behind the common out-<br>
put mirror M25. if the laser system for instance is a multiline laser system emitting laser<br>
beams of the first frequency and the second frequency only, the nonlinear conversion<br>
element 209 can be positioned in the path of the feedback beam 212, thereby only us-<br>
ing the nonlinear conversion element 209 for the feedback regulation.<br>
The embodiment can also be modified so that it comprises two Q-switches, where a<br>
first Q-switch is positioned in the first resonator in the path between mirror M21 and<br>
 <br>
M22, and a second Q-switch is positioned in the second resonator in the path between<br>
mirror M23 and M24. in this case, the Q-switches can be temporally synchronised, for<br>
instance if the difference in wavelengths between the first and second beams is rela-<br>
tively high.<br>
In the shown embodiment, the first pump source 202 is positioned behind mirror M21<br>
and the second pump source behind mirror 24. However, the first pump source 202<br>
may be positioned behind mirror M22 instead and/or the second pump source 203 can<br>
be positioned behind mirror M23. Also, the ring resonator cavities can comprise an op-<br>
tical diode so that the first beam 221 and second beam 222 only propagate in one di-<br>
rection in the ring resonator cavities. Alternatively, the laser system 201 can comprise a<br>
second output 215 through for instance mirror M26.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a third embodiment of the laser system according to the invention, in<br>
which like reference numerals refer to like parts of the first and second embodiments.<br>
The laser system 301 comprises a first pump source 302 and a second pump source<br>
303, preferably in form of a first laser diode and a second laser diode. The light emitted<br>
from the first pump source 302 is focused by a first condensing lens 304 and into a first<br>
gain element or laser element 306. When this laser element 306 is pumped, a laser<br>
pulse starts building up and is emitted from the laser element 306. A resulting emitted<br>
first laser beam 321 having a first frequency is emitted in both directions in a first linear<br>
resonator cavity, which comprises four mirrors M31, M32, M35 and M36. The four mir-<br>
rors M31, M32, M35 and M36 are preferably reflection coated in order to have high re-<br>
flectance at the first frequency.<br>
Similarly, the light emitted from the second pump source 303 is focused by a second<br>
condensing lens 305 and into a second gain element or laser element 307. When the<br>
second laser element 307 is pumped, a laser pulse starts building up and is emitted<br>
from the laser element 307. A resulting emitted laser beam 322 is emitted in both direc-<br>
tions in a second ring resonator cavity, which comprises four mirrors M33, M34, M35<br>
and M36.<br>
The first resonator and the second resonator path have a coinciding beam path part<br>
from mirror M34 to M35 and then from M35 to M36 and on to M33. A Q-switch 308 and<br>
a nonlinear conversion element 309 are positioned in this coinciding intracavity propa-<br>
gation path. The Q-switch 308 is preferably an active Q-switch, such as an electro-<br>
 <br>
optical Q-switch or an acousto-optical Q-switch. The nonlinear conversion element 309<br>
converts the first beam 321 and the second beam 322 by generating a converted beam<br>
having a frequency, which is the sum or the difference between the first frequency and<br>
the second frequency or the harmonics of the first and second frequencies. The output<br>
from the nonlinear conversion element 309 can also- contain several laser lines, i.e.<br>
several beams of different wavelengths/frequencies.<br>
The converted light beam, and if desired also the first 321 and the second beam 322, is<br>
output through the common output mirror M35, which preferably is anti-reflection<br>
coated to output the desired wavelength/frequencies. A feedback part 312 of the output<br>
313 is fed back via a beam splitter 310 to for instance a photo diode or a power meter<br>
311. The detected signal is processed by a regulation system or microprocessor 314,<br>
which controls the first pump source 302 and/or the second pump source 303. The<br>
pump sources 302, 303 in turn regulate the pulse build-up times for the laser elements<br>
306 and 307, since the pulse build-up time is dependent on the intensity of the pump<br>
light. Since the converted signal is a direct measure for the efficiency of the pulse over-<br>
lap between the pulses of the first beam 321 and the second beam 322, the signal de-<br>
tected by the photo diode 311 can be used for regulating the intensity output of the first<br>
pump source 302 and/or the second pump source 303, and thereby the corresponding<br>
build-up times of the individual laser pulses. It is thereby possible to optimise the pulse<br>
overlap between the pulses of the first beam 321 and the second beam 322 by varying<br>
the pump intensity and finding the maximum output of the feedback signal 312.<br>
The nonlinear conversion element 309 can also be positioned after the common output<br>
mirror 325. If the laser system for instance is a multiline laser system emitting laser<br>
beams of the first frequency and the second frequency only, the nonlinear conversion<br>
element 309 can be positioned in the path of the feedback beam 312, thereby only us-<br>
ing the nonlinear conversion element 309 for use in the feedback regulation.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a fourth embodiment of the laser system according to the invention. The<br>
laser system 401 comprises a first pump source 402 and a second pump source 403,<br>
preferably in form of a first laser diode and a second laser diode. The light emitted from<br>
the first pump source 402 is focused by a first condensing lens 404 and into a first gain<br>
element or laser element 406. When this laser element 406 is pumped, a laser pulse<br>
starts building up and is emitted from the laser element 406. A resulting emitted first la-<br>
ser beam 421 having a first frequency is emitted in both directions in a first linear reso-<br>
 <br>
nator cavity, which comprises two mirrors M41 and M43, and beam combining means<br>
416. The two mirrors M41 and M43 are preferably reflection coated in order to have<br>
high reflectance at the first frequency.<br>
Similarly, the light emitted from the second pump source 403 is focused by a second<br>
condensing lens 405 and into a second gain element or laser element 407. When the<br>
second laser element 407 is pumped, a laser pulse starts building up and is emitted<br>
from the laser element 407. A resulting emitted laser beam 422 is emitted in both direc-<br>
tions in a second linear resonator cavity, which comprises two mirrors M42 and M43<br>
and the beam combining means 416. The beam combining means 416 can for instance<br>
be a birefringent crystal and ensures that the two beams 421, 422 having different<br>
wavelengths follow two different paths.<br>
The first resonator and the second resonator path have a coinciding beam path part<br>
between mirror M43 and the beam combining means 416. A nonlinear conversion ele-<br>
ment 409 is positioned in this coinciding intracavity propagation path. A common Q-<br>
switch is disposed next to the two laser elements 406, 407 so that it overlaps both the<br>
first beam 421 and the second beam path 422. The Q-switch 408 is preferably an ac-<br>
tive Q-switch, such as an electro-optical Q-switch or an acousto-optical Q-switch. The<br>
nonlinear conversion element 409 converts the first beam 421 and the second beam<br>
422 by generating a converted beam having a frequency, which is the sum or the dif-<br>
ference between the first frequency and the second frequency or the harmonics of the<br>
first and second frequencies. The output from the nonlinear conversion element can<br>
also contain several laser lines, i.e. several beams of different wave-<br>
lengths/frequencies.<br>
The converted light beam, and if desired also the first and the second beam, is output<br>
through the common output mirror M43, which preferably is anti-reflection coated to<br>
output the desired wavelength/frequencies. A feedback part 412 of the output 413 is<br>
fed back via a beam splitter 410 to for instance a photo diode or a power meter 411.<br>
The detected signal is processed by a regulation system or microprocessor 414, which<br>
controls the first pump source 402 and/or the second pump source 403. The pump<br>
sources 402, 403 in turn regulate the pulse build-up times for the laser elements 406<br>
and 407, since the pulse build-up time is dependent on the intensity of the pump light.<br>
Since the converted signal is a direct measure for the efficiency of the pulse overlap<br>
between the pulses of the first beam 421 and the second beam 422, the signal de-<br>
 <br>
tected by the photo diode 411 can be used for regulating the intensity output of the first<br>
pump source 402 and/or the second pump source 403, and thereby the corresponding<br>
buiid-up times of the individual laser pulses. Thereby, it is possible to optimise the<br>
pulse overlap between the pulses of the first beam 421 and the second beam 422 by<br>
varying the pump intensity and finding the maximum output of the feedback signal 412.<br>
The nonlinear conversion element 409 can also be positioned after the common output<br>
mirror M43. If the laser system for instance is a multiline laser system emitting laser<br>
beams of the first frequency and the second frequency only, the nonlinear conversion<br>
element 409 can be positioned in the path of the feedback beam 412, thereby only us-<br>
ing the nonlinear conversion element for use in the feedback regulation.<br>
Fig. 5 shows a fifth embodiment of the laser system according to the invention, in which<br>
like reference numerals refer to like parts of the fourth embodiment. Therefore, only the<br>
difference between the two embodiments is described. The fifth embodiment only dif-<br>
fers from the fourth embodiment in that it comprises two separate Q-switches. A first Q-<br>
switch 517 is disposed in the first beam path 521 next to the first laser element 506. A<br>
second Q-switch 518 is disposed in the first beam path 522 next to the first laser ele-<br>
ment 507.<br>
Fig. 6 shows a schematic illustration of the functionality of the feedback regulation sys-<br>
tem. As described in the five previous embodiments, a first pump source 602 is used<br>
for generating a first beam having a first frequency f1f and a second pump source 603<br>
is used for generating a second beam having a second frequency f2. A nonlinear con-<br>
version element 609 is used for generating a converted beam having a third frequency<br>
f3. At least a part of this beam is detected by a photo diode or a power meter 611.<br>
The feedback regulation system 614 functions by letting the first pump source 602<br>
regulate the output effect of the resulting converted beam, and the second pump<br>
source 603 has to perform an optimisation routine in order to maximise the output ef-<br>
fect of the converted beam for the chosen effect of the first pump source 602. The<br>
regulating of the system functions by comparing 634 the detected signal with a refer-<br>
ence signal 633. A resulting error signal 635, which is the difference between the de-<br>
tected signal and the reference signal 633 is fed to a control system 631, which based<br>
on the error signal 635 generates a control signal 636, which in turn regulates the out-<br>
put power of the first pump source 602. Based on the chosen set point for the first<br>
 <br>
pump source 602, the feedback system uses the detected signal to perform an optimi-<br>
sation using an optimisation system 632 in order to generate a control signal 637,<br>
which in turn regulates the output power of the second pump source 603.<br>
In order for the regulation system 614 not to become unstable due to the optimisation<br>
routing, the optimisation routine has to be performed more often than the regulation<br>
routine. Hereby, it is also possible to average out the contribution from the optimisation.<br>
Fig. 7 shows an example on how the conversion efficiency  can manifest itself from<br>
the pulse overlap from the two laser beams as a function of the pump power P1 of the<br>
first pump source 602 and the pump power P2 of the second pump source 603. As in-<br>
dicated in Fig. 7 the regulation of the output power of the converted beam will be a lin-<br>
ear function over a large interval for the pump power of the pump sources 602, 603.<br>
Fig. 8 shows the conversion efficiency  as a function of the pump power P2 of the<br>
second pump source 603 for a given set point, i.e. a fixed pump power P1 of the first<br>
pump source 602 set via the regulation routine. The graph shows that the conversion<br>
efficiency has a Gaussian-like or bell-shaped dependence on the pump power P2 of the<br>
second pump source. In order to optimise the system, the optimisation routine is run<br>
using the optimisation system 632 in order to find the vertex of the graph or in other<br>
words to maximise the conversion efficiency  by regulating the pump power P2 of the<br>
second pump source 603..<br>
Figs. 9a-f show a number of measurements, which demonstrate the relationship be-<br>
tween the pump intensity and the pulse overlap. During the measurements the first<br>
pump source (a first laser diode for a 1319 nm laser) was driven with a constant cur-<br>
rent, while the current of the second pump source (a second laser diode for a 1064 nm<br>
laser) was varied. Fig. 9a shows the sum frequency output power in arbitrary units as a<br>
function of the second pump source current. The pump power is linearly proportional to<br>
the current. As seen from the measurements and the shown curve fit, the sum fre-<br>
quency output power shows a nearly Gaussian relationship with the pump current (or<br>
power). Fig. 9b-f show oscillator traces from the measurements with the frequency de-<br>
picted on the x-axis (in arbitrary units) and the power output from the 1064 nm laser<br>
(marked with reference numeral 50) and the power output from the 1319 nm (marked<br>
with reference numeral 60) on the y-axis, respectively. The corresponding sum fre-<br>
quency output power is shown in the top right corner of the individual figures. The<br>
 <br>
measurements clearly show that the sum frequency output power is highly affected by<br>
the current of the pump source with a non-linear relationship. Fig. 9c additionally shows<br>
spill-over effects from the 1319 nm pulses to the 1064 nm pulses. The spill-over effects<br>
are detection artefacts, which can be seen do not affect the sum frequency output<br>
power.<br>
The invention has been described with reference to a preferred embodiment. However,<br>
the scope of the invention is not limited to the illustrated embodiment, and alterations<br>
and modifications can be carried out without deviating from said scope of the invention.<br>
For instance do the individual laser resonators need not have a coinciding intracavity<br>
propagation axis, and the individual beams may instead be converted outside of the<br>
resonator or at a point, where the individual resonators cross each other.<br>
