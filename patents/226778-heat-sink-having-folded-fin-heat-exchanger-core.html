				<td>HEAT SINK HAVING FOLDED FIN HEAT EXCHANGER CORE<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001]	Technical Field<br>
This invention relates to a heat sink to dissipate heat, and in particular to a high<br>
performance folded fin heat exchanger core to the type to be used in a heat sink that is<br>
coupled to the CPU of a computing device. The particular folded fm configuration of the<br>
heat exchanger core herein disclosed provides maximum surface area, efficient heat<br>
transfer, and optimal air flow so that the heat generated by the CPU can be effectively<br>
collected and exhausted to the atmosphere.<br>
[0002]	Background Art<br>
Because of the heat that is generated by a central processing unit (CPU) common<br>
to personal computers, and the like, and the deleterious effects that may result as a<br>
consequence thereof, it is customary to couple a heat sink to the CPU by which the heat<br>
generated by the CPU is exhausted to the atmosphere. In fact, as operating speeds<br>
continue to increase, the CPU's and their support chips generate increasingly larger<br>
amounts of heat. In general, the core of the heat sink consists of a series of thick (e.g.<br>
extruded aluminium) heat conducting fins. A fan is positioned at an air intake end of the<br>
core to blow air over the fins by which the heat collected by the fins is exhausted to the<br>
atmosphere at an output end of the core.<br>
[0003] In the typical heat sink, a relatively long linear air flow path<br>
extends between the air intake and output ends of the heat exchanger<br>
core. Because of this linear airflow path having the intake and output<br>
ends lying opposite one another, it has proven to be difficult to increase the<br><br>
heat conductive surface area of the core without also significantly increasing the size, material<br>
consumption and cost thereof. As will be known to those skilled in the art, heat sinks having<br>
heat exchanger cores with long linear air flow paths and small heat collecting surface areas are<br>
characterized by reduced performance and efficiency. Moreover, because the extruded heat<br>
conducting fins are thick, the number of fins that can be accommodated by a heat sink while<br>
meeting PC requirements is reduced.<br>
[0004] Heat exchanger cores having the aforementioned linear flow path are known to<br>
experience a relatively high head pressure at the intake end and a pressure drop between the<br>
opposing intake and output ends. To overcome these pressure concerns and maintain a sufficient<br>
volume of air flowing through the heat exchanger core, an air delivery system containing air<br>
transport conduits is often employed to carry high pressure air from the fan to the air intake end<br>
of the core. Such an air dehvery system typically consumes space and increases cost and, in<br>
some cases, raises the head pressure at the air intake end which may adversely affect the flow<br>
rate.<br>
[0005] Therefore, what would be desirable is a heat sink for a GPU that contains an efficient heat<br>
exchanger core having maximized surface area and minimized space consumption and a<br>
relatively short, non-linear air flow path that can accommodate a suitable fan without requiring<br>
an intermediate space consuming air dehvery system so as to avoid an increase in the head<br>
pressure at the air intake end of the core and a reduction in the flow rate through the core.<br>
[0006] Examples of known heat sinks to be coupled to a CPU to dissipate the heat that is<br><br>
generated thereby are available by referring to the following United States patents:<br>

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
[0007] A heat sink is disclosed herein of the type to be coupled to the CPU of a computing<br>
device so that the heat generated by the CPU can be effectively and efficiently collected by a high<br>
performance folded fin heat exchanger core and exhausted to the atmosphere. Each heat<br>
conductive fin of the heat exchanger core is folded to include a firont face and a rear face that are<br>
spaced firom one another and squeezed together at the' bottom ends to establish a triangular<br>
primary air exhaust cavity. The primary air exhaust cavity runs laterally through the interior of<br>
the folded heat conductive fin. As an important detail of this invention, the top of each folded fin<br>
is open to create a vertically extending air intake opening which communicates at the interior of<br>
the fin with the laterally extending air exhaust cavity. Thus, it may be appreciated that the<br>
vertically extending air intake opening and the laterally extending air exhaust cavity are aligned<br>
at 90 degrees relative to one another to establish a perpendicular air flow path that runs from the<br>
air intake end at the top to the output end at opposite sides of the fin.<br><br>
[0008] An opening is cut into the front face of the fin, and the cut out surface is bent rearwardly along a fold line towards the rear face to create an inner air blade that functions as an air splitter.<br>
More particularly, a first portion of the intake air supply is blown downwardly through the<br>
vertically extending air intake opening and outwardly from opposite sides of the folded fin via<br>
the laterally extending primary exhaust cavity. The remaining portion of the air intake supply is<br>
blown downwardly through the air intake opening and into contact with the rearwardly bent inner<br>
air blade. The inner air blade splits the intake air supply and diverts the remaining portion<br>
thereof into a triangular supplemental air exhaust cavity via the opening that is cut into the front<br>
face of the fin to form the inner air blade. The supplemental air exhaust cavity is established<br>
between the front face of a first heat conductive fin and the rear face of an adjacent fin.<br>
[0009] In this regard, the heat exchanger core for the heat sink of this invention includes a<br>
plurality of the aforementioned heat conductive folded fins arranged face-to-face one another,<br>
such that generally upper and lower primary and supplemental air exhaust cavities extend<br>
laterally through successive pairs of fins. By virtue of the foregoing, the heat exchanger core is<br>
characterized by both optimal air flow and about twice the material and heat conductive surface<br>
area relative to conventional heat exchanger cores, whereby the thermal characteristics and<br>
efficiency of the heat sink is maximized. In the assembled heat sink configuration, a suitable<br>
(e.g. muffin) fan is attached to the top of the heat exchanger core so as to blow the intake air<br>
supply downwardly into the vertically extending air intake openings of the plurality of face-to-<br>
face aligned heat conductive fins. The CPU is coupled to the bottom of the heat exchanger core<br>
so that the heat generated by the CPU can be exhausted from opposite sides of the core to the<br>
atmosphere via the laterally extending primary and supplemental air exhaust cavities.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0019] Referring initially to FIGs. 1-3 of the drawings, there is shown a single folded heat<br>
conductive fin 1 that is but one of a plurality of fins that are assembled face-to-face one another<br>
to form an efficient, high performance folded fin heat exchanger core (designated 30 in FIG. 6)<br>
for the heat sink of the present invention. The fins 1 are manufactured firom a thermally<br>
conductive material such as copper, aluminum, or the like. Each heat conductive fin 1 has a firont<br>
face 3 and a rear face 5. The firont and rear faces 3 and .5 of fin 1 are spaced from one another to<br>
establish therebetween a laterally extending primary air exhaust cavity 7. As is best shown in<br>
FIG. 1, the primary air exhaust cavity 7 between the front and rear faces 3 and 5 of fin 1 has a<br>
triangular shape. That is to say, pressure is applied by which to bend or squeeze the lower ends<br>
of the firont and rear faces 3 and 5 together to make a small angle and thereby form two sides of<br>
the triangular primary air exhaust cavity 7.<br><br>
[0020] A flat closed portion 9 runs horizontally across the top at each of the opposite sides of fin<br><br>
1 so as to lie between the upper ends of the firont and back faces 3 and 5 and thereby form the<br>
third side of the triangular primary air exhaust cavity 7. A flat base 11 turns outwardly from the<br>
bottom of the front face 3 of fin 1 for a purpose that will soon be disclosed.<br>
[0021] An opening 10 is cut into the front face 3 of the folded heat conductive fin 1. The surface<br>
cut from the front face 3 to create the opening 10 is bent rearwardly towards the back face 5<br><br>
along a fold line 14 so as to form an inner air blade 12 that is positioned within the primary air<br>
exhaust cavity 7 of fin 1 in the space between the front and rear faces 3 and 5 thereof As will be<br>
described in greater detail hereinafter when referring to FIGs, 4 and 5, the inner air blade 12<br>
performs the important function of an air splitter or flow diverter for the supply of intake air that<br>
is pumped into the heat exchanger core (30 of FIG. 6) by means of a fan. To this end, the angle<br>
at which the inner air blade 12 is bent rearwardly towards the back face 5 along the fold line 14<br>
so as to lie within the primary air exhaust cavity 7 will determine the volume of air that is split<br>
off from the intake air supply and diverted to a soon to be described supplemental air exhaust<br>
cavity via the opening 10 in the front face 3.<br>
[0022] The opposite sides of the inner air blade 12 are bent forwardly along fold lines 16 in a<br>
direction towards the opening 10 in the firont face 3 of the folded heat conductive fin 1 so as to<br>
form side flaps 18. The side flaps 18 are bent at an angle so as to focus a portion of the intake air<br>
supply that is pumped into the heat sink exchanger core (30 of FIG. 6) against the inner air blade<br>
12 to be more effectively diverted to the supplemental air exhaust cavity (designated 24-1 in<br>
FIGs. 4 and 5) via the opening 10 in the firont face 3 of fin 1.<br>
As an important detail in the manufacture of the plurality of the folded heat conductive<br>
fins that are assembled face-to-face one another to form the heat exchanger core (30 of FIG. 6),<br>
an air intake opening 20 (best shown in FIG. 3) is located at the top of each fin 1. The air intake<br>
opening 20 through fin 1 is created by means of an outer air blade 22 that projects upwardly firom<br>
the rear face 5. As will be explained when referring to FIGs. 4 and 5, the air intake opening 20 at<br>
the top of fin 1 lies between the outer air blade 22 of fin 1 and the outer air blade of an adjacent<br><br>
fin. In this regard, it may be appreciated that air intake opening 20 extends vertically (i.e.<br>
downwardly) through the top of the folded heat conductive fin 1 so as to communicate with the<br>
primary air exhaust cavity 7 that runs horizontally (i.e. laterally) through the interior of fin 1 (also<br>
best shown in FIG. 3).<br>
[0024] Turning now to FIGs. 4 and 5 of the drawings, there is shown a pair of folded heat<br>
conductive fins 1-1 and 1-2 which are identical to the heat conductive fin 1 that was just<br>
described while referring to FIGs. 1-3. The fins 1-1 and 1-2 are arranged face-to-face one<br>
another and form the first two heat conductive fins of the plurality of fins of the heat exchanger<br>
core (designated 30 in FIG. 6). Fins 1-1 and 1-2 are provided to illustrate the non-linear air flow<br>
paths that are created through the air intake openings 20-1 and 20-2 and the generally upper and<br>
lower primary and supplemental air exhaust cavities 7-1, 24-1 and 7-2, 24-2 of an adjacent pair<br>
of heat conductive fins of the folded fin heat exchanger core following the splitting of the supply<br>
of intake air that is pimped into the core by a suitable fan (designated 40 in FIGs. 8 and 9).<br>
[0025] described above, the intake air supply generated by the fan is pumped into the interior<br>
of the heat conductive fins 1-1 and 1-2 by way of the vertically extending air intake opemngs 20-<br>
1 and 20-2. Air intake openings 20-1 and 20-2 are located at the top of each fin and lie between<br>
a corresponding pair of outer air blades 22-1 and 22-2 that project from respective rear faces 5-1<br>
and 5-2. A first portion of the intake air supply is guided downwardly through the vertically<br>
extending air intake opening 20-1 of the first fin 1-1 by the outer air blade 22-1 thereof. The first<br>
portion of the intake air supply that is pumped downwardly into the vertical air intake opening<br>
20-1 will blow heat that is collected by the first heat conductive fin 1-1 into the atmosphere from<br><br>
opposite sides of fin 1-1 via the primary air exhaust cavity 7-1 that runs laterally through the<br>
interior thereof.<br>
[0026] The remaining portion of the intake air supply that is generated by the fan will be pumped<br>
downwardly through the vertically extending air intake openings 20-1 and 20-2 and against the<br>
inner air blades 12-1 and 12-2 of the pair of heat conductive fins 1-1 and 1-2. The side flaps 18-1<br>
of the inner air blade 12-1 of the first fin 1-1 will focus the intake air along a concentrated stream<br>
to be diverted by inner air blade 12-1 into a generally lower supplemental air exhaust cavity 24-1<br>
that communicates with air intake opening 20-1 through the op(!ning (designated 10 in FIGs. 1-3)<br>
in the front face 3-l of fin 1-1. The supplemental air exhaust cavity 24-1 is established between<br>
the front face 3-1 of the first fin 1-1 and the rear face 5-2 of the adjacent fin 1-2. Like the<br>
primary air exhaust cavity 7-1 of fin 1-1, the supplemental air exhaust cavity 24-1 has a<br>
triangular shape that runs laterally through the heat exchanger core. While one side of the<br>
triangular primary air exhaust cavity 7-1 between the front and rear faces 3-1 and 5-1 is formed<br>
by the closed flats 9-1 at the top of the first fin 1-1, one side of the triangular supplemental air<br>
exhaust cavity 24-1 between the rear face 5-2 of the second fin 1-2 and the front face 3-1 of the<br>
first fin 1-1 is formed by the flat base 11-1 that turns out fiom the firont face 3-1 of fin 1-1.<br>
Accordingly, heat that is collected at the interface of the pair of adjacent folded heat conductive<br>
fins 1-1 and 1-2 will be blown into the atmosphere via the laterally extending supplemental air<br>
exhaust cavity 24-1.<br>
[0027] It may be appreciated that the generally upper and lower, laterally extending primary and<br>
supplemental air exhaust cavities 7-1, 24-1 and 7-2, 24-2 of the adjacent pair of heat conductive<br><br>
fins 1-1 and 1-2 are disposed in parallel alignment with each other and in perpendicular<br>
alignment with the vertically extending air intake openings 20-1 and 20-2. It may also be<br>
appreciated that the volume of air that is exhausted to the atmosphere via each of the primary and<br>
supplemental air exhaust cavities 7-1, 24-1 and 7-2, 24-2 of the pair of adjacent fins 1-1 and 1-2<br>
is variably and selectively controlled by the angles at which the inner air blades 12-1 and 12-2 are<br>
bent towards the rear faces 5-1 and 5-2 and into the primary air exhaust cavities 7-1 and 7-2 of<br>
each fin.<br>
[0028] FIG. 6 of the drawings shows the folded fin heat exchanger core 30 for the heat sink of<br>
this invention. As earlier disclosed, the core 30 is formed from a plurality of heat conductive fins<br>
that are folded in the manner shown in FIGs. 1-3 and arranged face-to-face one another in the<br>
manner shown in FIGs. 4 and 5. The heat exchanger core 30 of FIG. 6 has a total of 25 heat<br>
conductive fins. However, this number is for the purpose of example only, and it is to be<br>
understood that the number and size of the fins as well as the dimensions of the core 30 will<br>
depend upon the amount of heat to be dissipated and the type and capacity of the fan that is<br>
employed to pump the supply of intake air into the core.	<br>
[0029] FIG. 6 shows the face-to-face alignment of the heat conductive fins 1-1, 1-2...1-25 so as to form the folded fin heat exchanger core 30. An additional air blade 23 is attached to the last<br>
fin 1-25 to complete the core assembly. FIG. 6 also illustrates the generally upper and lower<br>
primary and supplemental air exhaust cavities (e.g. 7-1, 24-1 and 7-2, 24-2) that are established<br>
by successive pairs of the folded heat conductive fins (e.g. 1-1 and 1-2) to blow heat out the<br>
opposite sides of core 30 and into the atmosphere. As was disclosed above, an intake air supply<br><br>
32 is blown by a suitable fan (40 in FIGs. 8 and 9) downwardly through the heat exchanger core<br>
30 via the vertically extending air intake openings (e.g. 20-1 and 20-2) of fins 1-1 and 1-2. The<br>
air intake openings 20-1 and 20-2 of fins 1-1 and 1-2 communicate ith respective laterally<br>
extending primary and supplemental air exhaust cavities 7-1, 24-1 and 7-2, 24-2. Inasmuch as<br>
the vertically extending air intake openings 20-1 and 20-2 are arranged in perpendicular<br>
alignment with the laterally extending primary and supplemental air exhaust cavities 7-1, 24-1<br>
and 7-2, 24-2, the intake air supply 32 is correspondingly redir(5cted by heat conductive fins 1-1<br>
and 1-2 so as to be blown through a non-linear flow path between the intake and output ends of<br>
core 30.<br>
[0030] In particular, the downwardly directed intake air supply 32 through air intake openings<br>
20-1 and 20-2 is split by the inner air blades (e.g. 12-1 and 12-2). That is, a first portion of the<br>
intake air supply 32 is directed downwardly along the upwardly projecting outer air blades 22-1<br>
and 22-2 and the rear faces 5-1 and 5-2 of adjacent fins 1-1 and 1-2 to be exhausted from the<br>
opposite sides of heat exchanger core 30 via the laterally extending, generally upper primary air<br>
exhaust cavities 7-1 and 7-2. The remaining portion of the intake air supply 32 is directed<br>
downwardly through intake openings 20-1 and 20-2 and into contact with the inner air blades 12-<br>
1 and 12-2 of adjacent fins 1-1 and 1-2 so as to be diverted into the generally lower laterally<br>
extending supplemental air exhaust cavities 24-1 and 24-2 and exhausted to the atmosphere fi:om<br>
opposite sides of the core 30. In this same regard, the top of the folded fin heat exchanger core<br>
30 into which the intake air supply 32 is pumped is cooler than the bottom of core 30 which, in<br>
the heat sink configuration of FIG. 9, will he above a central processing unit fi-om which heat is<br>
collected and transferred to the atmosphere by way of the air exhaust cavities.<br><br>
[0031] By virtue of the folded fin heat exchanger core 30 of FIG. 6, the folded heat conductive fins 1-1, 1-2...1-25 will have more total surface area than will the fins that are associated with<br>
the cores of conventional heat sinks. Thus, the heat exchange efficiency of the core 30 will be<br>
correspondingly increased. Moreover, and as is best shown, in FIGs. 8 and 9, the core 30<br>
facilitates the integration of a suitable fan 40 directly above the heat sink without the necessity of<br>
including an additional space consuming fluid conduit interface. What is even more, the head<br>
pressure at the intake (i.e. top) end of heat exchanger core 30 will be reduced, while the flow<br>
length through core 30 will be shortened. Accordingly, the exhaust capability of the heat<br>
exchanger core 30 having the primary and supplemental air exhaust cavities communicating with<br>
opposite sides of the core will be effectively doubled relative to the exhaust capability of the core<br>
that has heretofor been used in the conventional heat sink.<br>
[0032] FIG. 7 of the drawings shows the heat exchanger core 30 of FIG. 6 in the manner that it<br>
will be secured to a metal (e.g. copper or aluminum) support plate 34 in the assembled heat sink<br>
configuration of FIGs. 8 and 9, A pair of flexible U-shaped stainless steel tie-down straps 36<br>
having locking tabs 38 projecting from each end thereof extend longitudinally over the core 30<br><br>
and along the flat closed portions 9-1, 9-2...9-25 at the tops of heat conductive fins 1-1, 1-2...1-<br>
25. The straps 36 bend over the front and back of the core 30, whereby the locking tabs 38 of I<br>
straps 36 are received and retained within respective locking notches 39 that are formed in<br>
opposite ends of support plate 34 so that a holding pressure is generated to secure the heat<br>
exchanger core 30 against the support plate 34.<br>
[0033] Of course, the tie-down straps 36 could extend over the heat exchanger core 30 at<br><br>
locations other than the closed flat portions 9-1, 9-2...9-25, as shown. In addition, the core 30<br>
could also be either soldered, brazed or welded to the support plate 34 which may obviate the<br>
requirement for hold down straps 36. However, in the case where straps 36 are used to secure<br>
the core 30 to the support plate 34 and thereby avoid the cost and time associated with soldering,<br>
brazing and welding, it has been found that adding a slightly curved (i.e. convex) force<br>
distribution edge (designated 25 and shown in phantom lines in FIG. 2) to the bottom of each<br>
heat conductive fin 1-1, 1-2... 1-25 will advantageously concentrate the forces to which the fins<br>
are subjected towards the center of the core 30 where such forces may be more easily dissipated.<br>
More particularly, the force distribution edge 25 that will lie against the support plate 34 is an<br>
extension of the rear face 5 of a heat conductive fin 1 so as to project below the flat base 11<br>
thereof. By way of example, the force distribution edge 25 of the fin 1 of FIG. 2 extends below<br>
the base 11 by about 0.005 inches at the midpoint thereof.<br><br>
[0034] FIGs. 8 and 9 of the drawings show the folded fin heal; exchanger core 30 of FIGs. 6 and<br>
7 used in a heat sink application for the purpose of dissipating the heat that is generated by a<br>
conventional central processing unit (CPU) 45 of the type that is available from different<br>
manufacturers and commonly found in a computing device, such as a personal computer, or the<br>
like. In the heat sink application, a suitable (e.g. muffin) fan 40 is seated on a fan mount 50, The<br>
fan mount 50 has a pair of legs 52 depending downwardly therefrom. A set of windows 54 is<br>
formed in each leg 52. The CPU 45 is electrically connected to a well known Ziff socket 55 (best<br>
shown in FIG. 8). A set of catches 57 projects outwardly form opposite ends of socket 55. The<br>
metal support plate 34 that was previously described while referring FIG. 7 is laid over top of the<br>
socket 55 so as to cover the CPU 45.<br><br>
[0035] As was also described while referring to FIG. 7, the folded fin heat exchanger core 30 is secured to support plate 34 by means of the U-shaped tie-down straps 36 and by moving the<br>
locking tabs 38 thereof into receipt by respective ones of the locking notches 39 of support plate<br>
34. With the fan 40 attached by means of fasteners 42 to the fan mount 50, the legs 52 which<br>
depend downwardly from fan mount 50 are mated to socket 55 by means of locating the sets of<br>
catches 57 that project from opposite ends of socket 55 through respective windows 54 that are<br>
formed in the legs 52. Accordingly, and as is best shown in the assembled heat sink<br>
configuration of FIG.9, the fan 40 is securely retained by fan mount 50 to lie immediately above<br>
the open top of the folded fin heat exchanger core 30 so that substantially all of the intake air<br>
supply that is produced by fan 40 will be blown downwardly and directly into the core 30 without<br>
a space consuming fluid conduit interface located therebetween. Thus, the heat generated by<br>
CPU 45 will be efficiently collected by heat exchanger core 30 and exhausted to the atmosphere<br>
through opposite sides of the core.<br>
[0036] Because of the folded fin configuration, wherein the front and rear faces 3-1, 5-1 and 3-2,<br>
5-2 of each successive pair of heat conductive fins (e.g. 1-1 and 1-2) of the heat exchanger core<br>
30 are bent together to form triangular upper and lower primary and supplemental air exhaust<br>
cavities 7-1, 24-1 and 7-2, 24-2, a heat sink will now be available having as much as twice the<br>
material and surface area when compared to conventional heat sinks without increasing the<br>
volume of the core. Thus, the volume of air flow is optimized and the corresponding amount of<br>
heat that can be exhausted to the atmosphere by the folded fin heat exchanger core 30 herein<br>
described is maximized relative to the cores of conventional heat sinks without increasing the<br>
size of core 30 beyond PC size restrictions. In this same regard, and unlike skived heat sinks, the<br><br>
heat sink configuration of this invention can be fully scaled in all directions. What is<br>
even more, the individual folded fins (e.g. 1-1 and 1-2) also function as load bearing<br>
structures for supporting components in this and other applications. Thus, with the heat<br>
exchanger core 30 secured to the support plate 34 as best shown in FIG. 7, the overall<br>
mechanical strength of the core is enhanced so as to be able to withstand top and side<br>
crushing forces.<br>
[0037] It is also within the scope of this invention to invert the fan 40 so that it is turned<br>
upside down with respect to its orientation with the heat exchanger core 30 shown in<br>
FIGs 8 and 9. In this case, instead of blowing cool fan air to the CPU 45 through the<br>
open top of core 30, the heat emitted from CPU 45 will now be suctioned to the<br>
atmosphere through the open top of the core. The structure of the core 30, however,<br>
need not be changed to accommodate this inverted fan orientation.<br><br>
