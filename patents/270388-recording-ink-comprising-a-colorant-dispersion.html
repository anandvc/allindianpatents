				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
COLORANT DISPERSION OF RECORDING INK, AND<br>
RECORDING INK USING THE SAME<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a colorant dispersion for<br>
a recording ink for image forming purposes and so forth, in<br>
which a colorant is dispersed in a dispersion medium as fine<br>
particles in a stable state, as well as to a recording ink, ink<br>
cartridge, method for inkjet recording, and image formed matter<br>
using the colorant dispersion.<br>
Background Art<br>
Colorant dispersions of recording ink are used in various<br>
applications that utilize their colorant properties, such as in<br>
writing inks for pens or seal inks, in image forming apparatuses<br>
using liquid inks (e.g. wet type printers or inkjet printers) and<br>
so forth.<br>
It is important that in these colorant dispersions the<br>
colorant should be uniformly dispersed at an intended particle<br>
diameter and the liquid property should be kept constant with<br>
time.<br>
Furthermore, since a colorant dispersion is less likely to<br>
be used alone but is often used in combination with a resin or<br>
other additives depending on the purpose, the colorant<br>
dispersion needs not only to keep the property itself excellent<br>
but also to have no influence on the properties of the other<br>
additives.<br>
Particularly when the colorant dispersion is used in a<br>
recording ink, as well as degradation with time of the colorant<br>
dispersion itself in the ink liquid, thickening of the ink liquid<br>
due to interaction with the other additives and adverse effects<br>
on degradation with time of the ink liquid and on printed images<br>
because of the combined use of the colorant dispersion with the<br>
other additives such as a resin in the recording ink, arise, which<br>
necessitates very careful selection of a dispersant for dispersing<br>
a colorant.<br>
The ink incorporating such a colorant dispersion of<br>
recording ink is applied or transferred onto a medium and dried<br>
to form a membrane or a recorded image.<br>
Recently, demand for aqueous inks is increasing in view<br>
of an environmental and safety perspective.<br>
However, recording performance of the aqueous ink is<br>
easily affected by a medium to be used, which is responsible for<br>
various problems concerning the membrane or the image.<br>
Particularly when paper is used for the medium instead of film,<br>
the problems are exaggerated.<br>
When the aqueous ink is used for recording on paper,<br>
substantial time is required for drying, and a fair amount of the<br>
aqueous ink permeates the paper due to excellent compatibility<br>
with the paper, which, particularly in the case of using uncoated,<br>
relatively nonsmooth paper, results in a low color density of the<br>
image formed by the colorant a fair amount of which has been<br>
lost by permeation into the paper. The latter problem has not<br>
been seen in recording using a solvent ink or a solventless ink.<br>
In order to increase the color density, it is necessary to<br>
increase the amount of the colorant in the ink, which, however,<br>
not only disadvantageously adds to the cost, but also results in<br>
aggregation or precipitation of the colorant and in turn in bad<br>
liquid stability of the ink liquid because the colorant density is<br>
increased in the solvent. In addition to these problems,<br>
increasing the amount of the colorant leads to a problem of bad<br>
appearance caused by roughening surfaces of the image and the<br>
membrane.<br>
Recently, methods for inkjet recording have become<br>
widespread as image forming methods, because they have<br>
advantages in that they facilitate full-color printing in the<br>
simper process than other method for recording and they allow<br>
for obtaining high-resolution images with a simply structured<br>
apparatus.<br>
In the inkjet recording methods, a small amount of an ink<br>
is flown by applying a pressure produced by heat and so forth to<br>
the ink, the flown ink is allowed to adhere to a medium for<br>
image forming such as paper, and the adhered ink needs to be<br>
dried promptly (to permeate the medium for image forming) to<br>
thereby form images. Therefore, drying property or an image<br>
density associated with the use of the aqueous ink may be<br>
getting more and more important in the inkjet recording<br>
method.<br>
Particularly recently, the inkjet recording methods are<br>
further developed in the field of industry and business, which<br>
increases demand for faster output of high density images.<br>
For example, in Patent Literature 1, for achieving<br>
excellent dispersion stability of an aqueous ink or a high density<br>
of printed images, a method of incorporating a polymer produced<br>
by copolymerizing (meth)acrylic acid with a monomer having a<br>
hydroxyl group, etc. is proposed, and as an example of the<br>
monomer having a hydroxyl group a polyethylene glycol allyl<br>
ether is described.<br>
However, the proposed aqueous ink fails to provide an<br>
adequate image density and has a drawback that when a<br>
colorant having a large specific surface area such as carbon<br>
black is dispersed the dispersion stability of the aqueous ink<br>
becomes poor with time.<br>
In Patent Literature 2, for increasing resistance of an ink<br>
to film-forming stress, an ink binder produced by copolymerizing<br>
an alkyl (meth)acrylate and a monomer having a nitrogen atom<br>
and a monomer having a hydrophilic group is proposed, and as<br>
examples of the hydrophilic monomer a<br>
hydroxypoly ethylene glycol mono(meth) acry late dialkylene glycol<br>
allyl ether and a monomer having an acrylic acid sulfonic acid<br>
group are described. However, this ink also fails to provide an<br>
adequate image density.<br>
In Patent Literature 3, an ink containing a polymer<br>
produced by copolymerizing sodium acrylate and a<br>
polyethyleneglycolmonoacrylate is proposed. However, this ink<br>
also fails to produce an adequate image density.<br>
Furthermore in Patent Literature 4, a solventless resin<br>
produced by copolymerizing a polyalkyleneglycolacrylate<br>
(80%-100%) with another monomer (0%-20%) is proposed.<br>
However, the solventless resin has low water-solubility,<br>
therefore is not suitable for use in a colorant dispersion<br>
containing water, and also has little effect on improvement of an<br>
image density produced.<br>

Disclosure of Invention<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a colorant<br>
dispersion for a recording ink which has excellent stability with<br>
time and is capable of providing a high image density, as well as<br>
recording ink, ink cartridge, method for inkjet recording, and<br>
image formed matter using the colorant dispersion for a<br>
recording ink.<br>
As a result of earnest studies aiming to solve the above<br>
mentioned problems, the present inventors have found that<br>
when a dispersant having a particular structure is used in a<br>
colorant dispersion containing the dispersant, a colorant, and<br>
water, storage stability with time of the colorant dispersion and<br>
of a recording ink containing the colorant dispersion can be<br>
improved and an image density in the case of image forming<br>
with the recording ink can also be improved.<br>

the inventors. The means for solving the above problems are as<br>
follows"<br> A colorant dispersion for a recording ink containing at<br>
least a dispersant, a colorant, and water, wherein the dispersant<br>

by formulae (1) to (3): <br><br>
where R1, R2, and R4 are selected from a hydrogen atom and<br>

where R8 is selected from a hydrogen atom and CH3; and X is<br>
selected from formulae (5)-1 and (5)-2:<br><br>
where M is selected from alkali metal, alkali earth metal,<br>
ammonium, and organic aminei<br><br>

wherein the inkjet recording apparatus is any one of a piezo<br>
inkjet recording apparatus and a thermal inkjet recording<br>
apparatus.<br>
Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
A colorant dispersion for a recording ink according to the<br>
present invention contains a dispersant, a colorant, and water,<br>
and further contains other components as required.<br>
The dispersant is a polycarboxylic acid dispersant<br>
containing units represented by formulae (1) to (3). When all<br>
these units are provided in a dispersant, the dispersant<br>
contributes to exhibit a significant effect on the storage stability<br>
of the colorant dispersant and ink liquid, and to provide a high<br>
image density to images formed with the ink liquid containing<br>
the colorant dispersion.<br>
In the formulae (1) to (3), R1, R2, and R4 are selected from<br>
a hydrogen atom and CH3; R3 is selected from a hydrogen atom<br>
and a C1-C3 alkyl group; R5 represents a C1-C3 alkyl group; AO<br>
and BO represent a C2-C3 oxyalkylene group; M is selected from<br>
alkali metal, alkali earth metal, ammonium, and organic amine;<br>
m represents an integer of 1 to 30; and n represents an integer<br>
of 5 to 50.<br>
When the dispersant further contains a unit(s)<br>
represented by formula (4) and/or formula (5), the image density<br>
becomes more excellent.<br><br>
In the formula (4), R6 is selected from a hydrogen atom<br>
and CH3; and R7 represents a C1-C3 alkyl group.<br><br>
In the formula (5), R8 is selected from a hydrogen atom<br>
and CH3; and X is selected from formulae (5)-l and (5)-2-<br><br>
where M is selected from alkali metal, alkali earth metal,<br>
ammonium, and organic amine;<br><br>
where M is selected from alkali metal, alkali earth metal,<br>
ammonium, and organic amine.<br>
On the other hand, a dispersant containing units of<br>
formulae (1) and (3) but not a unit of formula (2), or a<br>
dispersant containing units of formulae (1) and (2) but not a<br>
unit of formula (3) is less effective in forming images of high<br>
image density.<br>
It is an important that the unit represented by formula<br>
(1) is a salt. Otherwise the unit may lead to poor dispersibility<br>
of the colorant in water because of poor compatibility of the unit<br>
with water and to poor liquid stability of an ink with time when<br>
the ink has been formed with the colorant dispersion.<br>
Furthermore, when the unit represented by formula (1) is not a<br>
salt, the resulting dispersant becomes less effective in forming<br>
images of high image density.<br>
In order to synthesize the unit of formula (1) as a salt, a<br>
monomer of a salt of acrylic acid may be used, or after a<br>
polycarboxylic acid dispersant has been produced by<br>
copolymerizing nonsalt monomers for units (1) to (3) the<br>
polycarboxylic acid dispersant may be neutralized with a base to<br>
finally prepare a polycarboxylic acid dispersant having the unit<br>
of formula (1) as a salt. Alternatively, both of the above<br>
processes are used in combination to produce the unit of formula<br>
(1) as a salt.<br>
In formula (2), R3 is selected from H (hydrogen atom) and<br>
a C1-C3 alkyl group, however, using a hydrogen atom is<br>
preferred to using a C1-C3 alkyl group in terms of improving an<br>
image density.<br>
In formula (3), R5 needs to be a C1-C3 alkyl group. If R5<br>
is a hydrogen atom, the resulting dispersant becomes less<br>
effective in forming a high image density.<br>
In addition, when a dispersant disclosed in the present<br>
invention is used for dispersing a colorant under alkaline<br>
conditions, not only dispersibility of the colorant is improved but<br>
also a resulting image density becomes excellent.<br>
A monomer for the unit of formula (1) is, for example, as<br>
shown as formula (6):<br><br>
In the formula (6), R1 is selected from H and CH3; M is<br>
selected from H, alkali metal, alkali earth metal, ammonium,<br>
and organic amine; and provided that, when M is H, after a<br>
polycarboxylic acid dispersant has been produced by<br>
copolymerizing this monomer with the other monomers, the<br>
polycarboxylic acid dispersant needs to be neutralized with a<br>
base to change the carboxylic acid moieties to moieties of a salt<br>
of carboxylic acid.<br>
Examples of the formula (6) include (meth)acrylic acid or<br>
a salt thereof. Examples of the salt include salts of: an alkali<br>
metal such as lithium, sodium, and potassium,' an alkali earth<br>
metal such as calcium, and magnesium; ammonium; and an<br>
organic amine, for example- aliphatic amines produced by<br>
substituting one or more hydrogen atom(s) of ammonia with<br>
alkyl group(s), such as mono-, di-, and trimethylamine, and<br>
mono-, di-, and triethylamine; alcohol amines produced by<br>
substituting one or more hydrogen atom(s) of ammonia with<br>
alcohol group(s), such as monoethanolamine, diethanolamine,<br>
triethanolamine, methylethanolamine, methyldiethanolamine,<br>
dimethylethanolamine, choline, aminoethanepropanediol,<br>
monopropanolamine, dipropanolamine, tripropanolamine,<br>
isopropanolamine, trishydroxymethylaminomethane,<br>
aminoethylpropanediol; and cyclic amines such as morpholine,<br>
N-methylmorpholine, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, and<br>
2-pyrrolidone.<br>
Among these salts, salts of an alkali metal such as<br>
lithium, sodium, and potassium, and salts of an alcohol amine<br>
such as diethanolamine and triethanolamine are preferred in<br>
terms of dispersion stability.<br>
A monomer for the unit of formula (2) is, for example, as<br>
shown as formula (7):<br><br>
In the formula (7), R2 is selected from H and CH3; R3 is<br>
selected from H and a C1-C3 alkyl group; AO represents a C2-C3<br>
oxyalkylene group; and m represents an integer of 1 to 30.<br>
Preferably R3 is a hydrogen atom in terms of improving<br>
an image density.<br>
The polyoxyalkylene group may be formed by<br>
polymerizing or copolymerizing ethylene oxide and/or propylene<br>
oxide.<br>
The polyoxyalkylene group is preferably a polyethylene<br>
oxide group, which is the most effective in improving an image<br>
density.<br>
M is an integer of 1 to 30, and preferably an integer of 4<br>
to 25. When m is one or more, the resulting dispersant becomes<br>
more effective in increasing an image density. When m is 30 or<br>
less, the resulting dispersant tends to improve dispersibility.<br>
Especially when m is 4 to 25, the effects of the resulting<br>
dispersant are pronounced.<br>
Examples of formula (7) include polyalkyleneglycol<br>
mono(meth)allyl ethers and alkoxypolyalkyleneglycol<br>
mono(meth)allyl ethers. Among the latter ethers,<br>
methoxypolyalkyleneglycol mono(meth)allyl ethers are<br>
preferred.<br>
A monomer for the unit of formula (3) is, for example, as<br>
shown as formula (8):<br><br>
In the formula (8), R4 is selected from H and CH3; R5<br>
represents a C1-C3 alkyl group; BO represents a C2-C3<br>
oxyalkylene group; and n represents an integer of 5 to 50.<br>
The polyoxyalkylene group may be formed by<br>
. polymerizing or copolymerizing ethylene oxide and/or propylene<br>
oxide.<br>
The polyoxyalkylene group is preferably a polyethylene<br>
oxide group, which is the most effective in improving an image<br>
density.<br>
"n" is an integer of 5 to 50, and preferably an integer of<br>
8 to 35. When n is 4 or more, the resulting dispersant becomes<br>
more effective in increasing an image density. When n is more<br>
than 50, however, the solubility of the resulting dispersant in<br>
water becomes poor, and it becomes difficult to use the<br>
dispersant as an aqueous dispersant. Especially when n is 8 to<br>
35, the effect of resulting dispersant in increasing an image<br>
density is excellent.<br>
Examples of formula (8) include alkoxypolyalkyleneglycol<br>
mono(meth)acrylates. Specific preferred examples thereof<br>
include methoxypolyethyleneglycol mono(meth)acrylates,<br>
ethoxypolyethyleneglycol mono(meth)acrylates,<br>
propoxypolyethyleneglycol mono(meth)acrylates, and<br>
isopropoxypolyethyleneglycol mono(meth)acrylates. Among<br>
them, methoxypolyethyleneglycol mono(meth)acryltes are<br>
particularly preferred.<br>
A monomer for the unit of formula (4) is, for example, as<br>
shown as formula (9):<br><br>
In the formula (9), R6 is selected from H and CH3; and R7<br>
represents a C1-C3 alkyl group.<br>
Examples of formula (9) include esters of (meth)acrylic<br>
acid such as methyl (meth)acrylate, ethyl (meth)acrylate, propyl<br>
(meth)acrylate, and isopropyl (meth)acrylate.<br>
A monomer for the unit of formula (5) is, for example, as<br>
shown as formula (10):<br><br>
In the formula (10), R8 is selected from H and CH3J and X<br>
is selected from formula (10)-1 and formula (l0)-2:<br>
—SO3M (10)-1<br>
where M is selected from H, alkali metal, alkali earth metal,<br>
ammonium, and organic amine; and provided that, when M is H,<br>
after a polycarboxylic acid dispersant has been produced by<br>
copolymerizing this monomer with the other monomers, the<br>
polycarboxylic acid dispersant needs to be neutralized with a<br>
base to change the sulfonic acid moieties to moieties of a salt of<br>
sulfonic acid;<br><br>
where M is selected from H, alkali metal, alkali earth metal,<br>
ammonium, and organic amine; and provided that, when M is H,<br>
after a polycarboxylic acid dispersant is produced by<br>
copolymerizing this monomer with the other monomers, the<br>
polycarboxylic acid dispersant needs to be neutralized with a<br>
base to change the sulfonic acid moieties to moieties of a salt of<br>
sulfonic acid.<br>
Examples of formula (10) include methallylsulfonic acid,<br>
p-methallyloxybenzenesulfonic acid or a salt thereof. Examples<br>
of the salt include salts of: an alkali metal such as lithium,<br>
sodium, and potassium; an alkali earth metal such as calcium,<br>
and magnesium.' ammonium; and an organic amine, for example:<br>
aliphatic amines produced by substituting one or more hydrogen<br>
atom(s) of ammonia with alkyl group(s), such as mono-, di-, and<br>
trimethylamine, and mono-, di-, and triethylamine,' alcohol<br>
amines produced by substituting one or more hydrogen atom(s)<br>
of ammonia with alcohol group(s), such as monoethanolamine,<br>
diethanolamine, triethanolamine, methylethanolamine,<br>
methyldiethanolamine, dimethylethanolamine, choline,<br>
aminoethanepropanediol, monopropanolamine, dipropanolamine,<br>
tripropanolamine, isopropanolamine,<br>
trishydroxymethylaminomethane, aminoethylpropanediol; and<br>
cyclic amines such as morpholine, N-methylmorpholine,<br>
N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, and 2-pyrrolidone.<br>
Among these salts, salts of an alkali metal such as<br>
lithium, sodium, and potassium, and salts of an alcohol amine<br>
such as diethanolamine and triethanolamine are preferred in<br>
terms of dispersion stability.<br>
The polycarboxylic acid dispersant according to the<br>
present invention is produced by copolymerizing monomers of<br>
formula (6), formula (7), and formula (8). Here, monomers of<br>
formulas (6) to (8) may be used alone or in combination,<br>
respectively.<br>
Furthermore, when a colorant dispersion has been<br>
prepared by using a polycarboxylic acid dispersant produced by<br>
copolymerizing, in addition to the above-mentioned monomers,<br>
monomers of formula (9) and/or formula (10) each with one or<br>
more type(s), it can produce an image density more excellent<br>
than an image density obtained with an ink containing a<br>
colorant dispersion using a polydcarboxylic acid dispersant<br>
produced by copolymerizing only the above-mentioned<br>
monomers.<br>
A compounding ratio (mole %) of the monomers of<br>
formulae (6) to (10) is preferably as follows,<br>
45-65 : 3-25 : 525 : 015 : 823 (= formula (6) : formula (7) :<br>
formula (8) : formula (9) : formula (10)).<br>
The polycarboxylic acid dispersant preferably has a<br>
number average molecular weight in the range of 2,000 to 20,000<br>
(as measured by a GPC method using a pullulan standard).<br>
A dispersant which can be used in the present invention<br>
can be prepared by a synthetic process, however, also is<br>
commercially available as CHUPOL series polycarboxylic acid<br>
dispersant produced by TAKEMOTO OIL &amp; FAT Co., Ltd.<br>
A method for copolymerizing is not particularly limited as<br>
long as the resulting dispersant is not functionally impaired,<br>
and may be selected from known methods, for example, a method<br>
disclosed in Japanese Patent No.2646449.<br>
An example of the synthetic method will be described<br>
below for reference.<br>
Above-mentioned monomers are subjected to a radical<br>
copolymerization reaction in the presence of a radical initiator<br>
so as to prepare a radical copolymer with a predetermined ratio<br>
of the monomers. It is important that the copolymerization<br>
reaction should be initiated in an aqueous solution using water<br>
or a solvent mixture of water and water-soluble organic solvent.<br>
Specifically, first, each monomer is dissolved in water,<br>
and an aqueous solution containing the monomers in a total<br>
concentration of 10 mole % to 45 mole % is prepared. Next, a<br>
radical initiator is added into the aqueous solution under a<br>
nitrogen gas atmosphere to initiate a radical copolymerization<br>
reaction at a temperature of 50°C to 70°C for 5 hr to 8 hr.<br>
Thereby a polycarboxylic acid dispersant (water-soluble vinyl<br>
copolymer) is obtained. The type of the radical initiator is not<br>
particularly limited, as long as it is decomposed at a<br>
copolymerization reaction temperature to produce radicals, and<br>
is preferably a water-soluble radical initiator. Examples of the<br>
water soluble radical initiator include potassium persulfate,<br>
ammonium persulfate, hydrogen peroxide, and<br>
2,2-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride. These can be<br>
combined with a reducing substance such as a sulfite salt and<br>
L-ascorbic acid and further with an amine, etc. to serve also as a<br>
redox initiator for use.<br>
The pH (hydrogen-ion exponent) of a colorant dispersion<br>
may be neutral (7.0 ± 0.5), however, is preferably alkaline at pH<br>
8 to pH 12, and preferably at pH 9 to pH 11 in terms of<br>
improving dispersibility and of increasing an image density (see<br>
Examples 3 and 13). When the pH is excessively low, drying<br>
property/ image density tends to fall. When the pH is more<br>
than 11, drying property/ image density again tends to fall,<br>
because base components are increased in amount and as a<br>
result remain in an image. The pH can be measured by a pH<br>
meter using a glass electrode method.<br>
In order to control the pH to fall within the above range,<br>
a pH adjuster is preferably used. The amount of the pH<br>
adjuster cannot be specifically specified as it differs depending<br>
on the materials contained in the colorant dispersion. However,<br>
the amount of pH adjuster may be adjusted suitably such that<br>
the pH of the colorant dispersion as measured by a pH meter<br>
falls within the above range.<br>
The pH adjuster may be any substance as long as it is<br>
basic, and is, for example, ammonia; an alcohol amine such as<br>
triethanolamine, tripropanolamine, diethanolamine, and<br>
monoethanolamine; an alkali metal hydroxide such as lithium<br>
hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, and sodium hydroxide; an acid<br>
ammonium salt such as ammonium sulfate, and ammonium<br>
tartrate; an ammonium salt such as a quaternary alkyl<br>
ammonium hydroxide; a phosphonium hydroxide; or a mixture<br>
thereof.<br>
The type of a colorant of the present invention is not<br>
particularly limited, and may be selected from an inorganic<br>
colorant and an organic colorant.<br>
When the colorant is used in a recording ink, the colorant<br>
is preferably selected from a pigment in terms of preventing<br>
color fading due to exposure to light and of solubility in water.<br>
Examples of a preferred pigment for inkjet application<br>
are as follows. Examples of a black pigment preferably include<br>
a carbon black such as ketjen black, furnace black, acetylene<br>
black, thermal black, and gas black. Furthermore, carbon<br>
blacks surfaces of which are treated with an acid or an alkali,<br>
surfaces of which are coated with a surfactant of various kinds<br>
or with a resin, or on which some group is grafted, or which are<br>
encapsulated, may be used.<br>
Particularly when acid carbons which are produced by<br>
treating surfaces of a carbon black with an acid and show acidity<br>
are used, drying property as well as an image density are<br>
significantly improved. Furthermore also when carbon blacks<br>
which are produced by coating surfaces thereof with a resin<br>
having a sulfonic acid group or a carboxy group or by grafting a<br>
sulfonic acid group or a carboxy group therein are used, the<br>
drying property as well as an image density are again<br>
significantly improved.<br>
Particularly when the colorant is a material having a<br>
large specific surface area such as carbon black, dispersion<br>
stability or effects on a high image density become more<br>
excellent in the colorant dispersion using the dispersant<br>
according to the present invention than in a colorant dispersion<br>
using other dispersant.<br>
Specific examples of the acid carbon include MA7, MA8,<br>
MA100, MA600, #45, #50, #2200B, #2350, #2650, OIL 7B, and<br>

manufactured by Degussa Inc.).<br>
Among these, particularly carbon blacks having pH<br>
values of 5 or less and containing volatile components in ratios<br>
of 3.5% by mass to 8.0% by mass are preferably used, and gas<br>
blacks are preferred in terms of drying property and an image<br>
density.<br>

Pigment Yellow 180.<br>
When Pigment Yellow 74 for the yellow pigment, Pigment<br>
Red 122 and Pigment Violet 19 for the magenta pigment, and<br>
Pigment Blue 15 for the cyan pigment are used, it is possible to<br>
obtain a well-balanced ink which is excellent in color tone and<br>
resistance to light.<br>
The concentration of the pigments in the colorant<br>
dispersion is preferably 0.1% by mass to 50% by mass, and more<br>
preferably 0.1% by mass to 30% by mass.<br>
Furthermore for the colorant used in the present<br>
invention, colorants produced by coating surfaces thereof with a<br>
surfactant such as a dispersant or with a resin, or by grafting<br>
some group therein or by encapsulating them are preferably<br>
used.<br>
For the colorant dispersion of the present invention, other<br>
known dispersants may be used in combination.<br>
As the known dispersant usable for this purpose, an<br>
anionic surfactant, an ampholytic surfactant, a cationic<br>
surfactant, and a nonionic surfactant may be appropriately used<br>
as required. Specific examples of these are as follows.<br>
Examples of the anionic surfactant include<br>
alkylsulfocarboxylates, crolefine sulfonates, polyoxyethylene<br>
alkyl ether acetates, N-acylamino acids and salts thereof, salts<br>
of N-acylmethyltaurines, alkyl sulfates, polyoxyalkyl ether<br>
sulfates, polyoxyethylenealkyl ether phosphates, citronellic acid<br>
soaps, salts of castor oil sulfate esters, salts of lauryl alcohol<br>
sulfate esters, alkylphenol type phosphate esters,<br>
naphthalenesulfonate formalin condensates, alkyl type<br>
phosphate esters, alkylallylsulfonates, diethylsulfosuccinates,<br>
and diethylhexylsulfosuccinate dioctylsulfosuccinates.<br>
Examples of the cationic surfactant include<br>
2-vinylpyridine derivatives and poly-4-vinylpyridine derivatives.<br>
Examples of the ampholytic surfactant include lauryl dimethyl<br>
amino acetic acid betaine,<br>
2-alkyl-N-carboxymethyl-N-hydroxyethylimidazolinium betaines,<br>
coconut oil fatty acid amidopropyldimethylaminoacetic acid<br>
betaines, polyoctylpolyaminoethylglycine, or other imidazoline<br>
derivatives.<br>
For the nonionic surfactant, the following compounds can<br>
be used: ethers such as polyoxyethylene nonylphenyl ethers,<br>
polyoxyethylene octylphenyl ethers, polyoxyethylene<br>
dodecylphenyl ethers, polyoxyethylene lauryl ethers,<br>
polyoxyethylene oleyl ethers, polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers, and<br>
polyoxyethylene dialkyl ethers; esters such as polyoxyethylene<br>
oleic acids, polyoxyethylene oleates, polyoxyethylene distearates,<br>
sorbitan laurate, sorbitan monostearate, sorbitan monooleate,<br>
sorbitan sesquioleate, polyoxyethylene monooleates, and<br>
polyoxyethylene stearates; and acetyleneglycols such as<br>
2,4,7,9-tetramethyl-5-desine- 4,7- diol,<br>
3,6-dimethyl-4octine-3,6diol, and 3,5dimethyl-l- hexine- 3-ol.<br>
When a carbon black has been selected for a colorant, the<br>
usable known dispersants are most preferably<br>
naphthalenesulfonate formalin condensates, an anionic<br>
surfactant. When the solid content of the carbon black is as<br>
high as 20% by mass or more, this dispersant is more effective<br>
than the other dispersants.<br>
For a carbon black, carbon blacks having a BET surface<br>
area of 100 m2/g to 400 m2/g and a first-order particle diameter<br>
of 10 nm to 30 nm are particularly preferred in terms of a high<br>
density and stability of printed images.<br>
The amount of a dispersant needs to be appropriately<br>
selected depending on the type of the colorant, and is preferably<br>
0.005 parts by mass to 5 parts by mass for 1 part by mass of the<br>
colorant.<br>
When a carbon black is used for a colorant, incorporating<br>
the dispersant in an amount of 0.01 parts by mass to 2 parts by<br>
mass for 1 part by mass of the colorant produces a homogenous<br>
colorant dispersion which has no problem in practice. When<br>
the amount of the dispersant is controlled to this range,<br>
dispersibility of the colorant is improved and stability with time<br>
of the colorant dispersion or a recording ink tends to improve.<br>
Particularly preferably, the amount of the dispersant is 0.02<br>
parts by mass to 0.5 parts by mass for 1 part by mass of the<br>
colorant, which further improves stability with time of the<br>
colorant dispersion and the recording ink.<br>
It is possible to incorporate an additive of various kinds<br>
other than water in the colorant dispersion of the present<br>
invention. Examples thereof include: water-soluble organic<br>
mediums,' various surfactants such as a nonionic surfactant,<br>
anionic surfactant, cationic surfactant, and amp holy tic<br>
surfactant; and antiseptic agents.<br>
Examples of the water-soluble organic medium include<br>
alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, and 2-propanol;<br>
polyhydric alcohols such as ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol,<br>
triethylene glycol, propylene glycol, and glycerine; pyrrolidone<br>
derivatives such as N-methyl pyrrolidone and 2-pyrrolidone;<br>
ketones such as acetone and methylethylketone; and<br>
alkanolamines such as monoethanol amine, diethanol amine,<br>
and triethanol amine.<br>
The colorant dispersion of the present invention using a<br>
carbon black can be obtained by dispersing the carbon black, a<br>
dispersant, water, and an additive of various kinds as required<br>
by means of a known dispersing machine such as sand mills, ball<br>
mills, roll mills, beads mills, nanomizers, homogenizers, and<br>
ultrasonic dispersion devices. For this process, preferably a<br>
"wet-type dispersion treatment" is employed. The "wet-type<br>
dispersion treatment" as used herein refers to a treatment of<br>
finely pulverizing and dispersing a mixture of the carbon black,<br>
the dispersant, water, and an water-soluble organic solvent as<br>
required by means of the above-mentioned known dispersing<br>
machine according to a so-called "wet-type dispersing method".<br>
A colorant dispersion using a pigment as the colorant can<br>
be appropriately used particularly in a pigment inkjet ink.<br>
The pigment inkjet ink is obtained by a known method,<br>
for example, a method in which a pigment dispersion, water, a<br>
water-soluble organic solvent, and a surfactant, etc. are mixed<br>
under stirring, coarse particles are filtered out by a filter or a<br>
centrifuge, etc., and the filtrate is deaerated as required. In<br>
addition, the amount of a carbon black in an ink is preferably<br>
1% by mass to 20% by mass to the total weight of the ink.<br>
When the amount is less than 1% by mass, the printed images<br>
lack sharpness due to a low image density. When the amount is<br>
more than 20% by mass, the viscosity of the ink tends to<br>
increase, resulting in easy occurrence of nozzle clogging.<br>
Furthermore, materials similar to those described as additives<br>
for the pigment dispersion can be added into the ink as required.<br>
For example, the amount of the water-soluble organic<br>
solvent is 50% by mass or less, preferably 5% by mass to 40% by<br>
mass, and more preferably 10% by mass to 35% by mass to the<br>
total amount of the ink.<br>
A recording ink according to the present invention can be<br>
preferably used in an ink cartridge for housing the ink as<br>
described below. In addition, the recording ink according to the<br>
present invention can be used for image formation by applying<br>
the recording ink to an inkjet recording apparatus which ejects<br>
the recording ink onto a recording medium such as paper, as<br>
described below.<br>
(Ink cartridge)<br>
An ink cartridge according to the present invention<br>
includes the recording ink of the present invention and a<br>
container configured to house the recording ink.<br>
The container is not particularly limited and the shape,<br>
the structure, the size, the material, or the like of the container<br>
can be appropriately selected depending on the purpose;<br>
preferred examples of the container include containers having at<br>
least an ink bag which is formed with aluminum laminate film,<br>
resin film, or the like, and a plastic case.<br>
The ink cartridge of the present invention houses the<br>
recording ink of the present invention and can be detachably<br>
mounted on various inkjet recording apparatuses. Further, it is<br>
particularly preferable that the inkjet cartridge be detachably<br>
mounted to an inkjet recording apparatus for use in the present<br>
invention described below.<br>
(Inkjet recording apparatus and inkjet recording method)<br>
The inkjet recording apparatus of the present invention<br>
contains at least an ink jetting unit configured to jet the<br>
recording ink of the present invention by applying a stimulus to<br>
the recording ink to form an image, and further contains<br>
additional units as required.<br>
An inkjet recording method of the present invention<br>
includes at least applying a stimulus to the recording ink of the<br>
present invention, ejecting the recording ink so as to record an<br>
image, and further includes additional steps as required.<br>
Examples of the ink jetting unit include continuous<br>
injection ink jetting units and on-demand ink jetting units.<br>
Examples of the on-demand type ink jetting unit include ink<br>
jetting units using piezo-inkjet method, thermal-inkjet method,<br>
and electrostaticinkjet method. Among these ink jetting units,<br>
those using a piezo-inkjet method and a thermal-inkjet method<br>
are particularly preferred.<br>
The piezo-inkjet method is a method in which a<br>
diaphragm forming a wall surface of an ink flow passage is<br>
deformed by means of a piezoelectric element as a pressure<br>
generating unit configured to pressurize an ink flowing in the<br>
ink flow passage and change the ink volume in the ink flow<br>
passage, thereby ink droplets can be jetted (see Japanese Patent<br>
Application LaidOpen (JP-A) No.02-51734).<br>
The thermal-inkjet method is a method in which an ink is<br>
heated in an ink flow passage using a heat element or a resistive<br>
element to generate air bubbles therein, thereby ink droplets<br>
can be jetted (see Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (JP-A)<br>
No. 61-59911).<br>
The electrostatic-inkjet method is a method in which a<br>
diaphragm forming a wall surface of an ink flow passage is<br>
deformed by applying a static electricity generated in between<br>
the diaphragm and electrodes, where the diaphragm is disposed<br>
to face the electrodes, to change the ink volume in the ink flow<br>
passage, thereby ink droplets can be jetted (see Japanese Patent<br>
Application Laid Open (JPA) No. 0671882).<br>
The stimulus can be generated, for example, by means of<br>
a stimulus generating unit. The stimulus is not particularly<br>
limited, may be appropriately selected depending on the purpose,<br>
and examples thereof include heat (temperature), pressure,<br>
vibration, and light. These stimuli may be used alone or in<br>
combination of two or more. Among these, heat and pressure<br>
are preferably used.<br>
Examples of the stimulus generating unit include heaters,<br>
pressurizing devices, piezoelectric elements, vibration<br>
generators, ultra-sonic oscillators, and light. Specific examples<br>
of the stimulus generating unit include piezoelectric actuators<br>
such as piezoelectric elements; thermal actuators utilizing phase<br>
changes attributable to film boiling of a liquid by using an<br>
electric heat exchanger element such as exothermic resistor!<br>
shape-memorizing alloy actuators using metal phase changes<br>
attributable to temperature change; and electrostatic actuators<br>
using electrostatic force.<br>
The aspect of the jetting of the recording ink is not<br>
particularly limited and differs depending on the type of the<br>
stimulus. For example, when the stimulus is heat, there is a<br>
method in which a heat energy in accordance with a recording<br>
signal is given to the recording ink in a recording head by using,<br>
for example, a thermal head to generate air bubbles in the<br>
recording ink by means of the effect of the heat energy and to<br>
thereby jet and spray the recording ink as droplets from a nozzle<br>
hole of the recording head by means of the effect of the pressure<br>
of the air bubbles. When the stimulus is pressure, for example,<br>
there is a method in which a voltage is applied to a piezoelectric<br>
element, which is bonded to the position called as a pressure<br>
chamber placed in an ink flow passage within a recording head,<br>
to make the piezoelectric element bend to shrink the inner<br>
volume of the pressure chamber and to thereby eject and spray<br>
the recording ink as droplets from a nozzle hole of the recording<br>
head.<br>
An image formed matter is obtained on demand on a<br>
recording medium by recording an image on the recording<br>
medium using the inkjet recording apparatus of the present<br>
invention which houses the recording ink of the present<br>
invention. The recording ink can be replaced on an ink<br>
cartridge basis.<br>
(Image formed matter)<br>
An image formed matter of the present invention is<br>
composed of at least an image formed on a recording medium ..<br>
with the use of the recording ink according to the present<br>
invention.<br>
The recording medium is not particularly limited and can<br>
be appropriately selected depending on the purpose)' preferred<br>
examples thereof include a recording medium having ink<br>
absorbency such as paper, and a recording medium substantially<br>
lacking ink absorbency.<br>
Examples of the recording medium include plastic sheets<br>
based on a material such as polyethylene terephthalate,<br>
polycarbonate, polypropylene, polyethylene, polysulfone, ABS<br>
resins, or polyvinyl chloride; recording media manufactured by<br>
coating with a metal a surface of a metal such as brass, iron,<br>
aluminum, SUS, or copper, or by coating with a metal a<br>
nonmetal base material, using a technique such as vapor<br>
deposition; recording media manufactured by subjecting paper<br>
as a base material to water-shedding treatment; and recording<br>
media composed of a so-called ceramic material manufactured by<br>
firing an inorganic material at a high temperature. Among<br>
these, paper is particularly preferred in terms of cost efficiency<br>
and naturalness of images produced thereon.<br>
Examples<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention will be further<br>
specifically described based on Examples.' however, the present<br>
invention is not limited to these Examples, and those produced<br>
by appropriately modifying these Examples without departing<br>
from the scope of the present invention are included in the<br>
present invention.<br>
Note that V or "n" of a polyethylene glycol material<br>
used as material B or C, respectively, represents a number of<br>
moles of ethylene oxide units polymerized by an addition<br>
reaction in each monomer. In addition in Examples, "part(s)"<br>
represents "part(s) by mass" for all the cases, and "%"<br>
represents "% by mass" except where "%" is used as a unit for a<br>
rate of change in viscosity.<br>
