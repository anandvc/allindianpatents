This invention relates   to apparatus for screening, separating or<br>
grading materials and in particular to a shielding device for protecting parts of the apparatus from material that may ingress into the apparatus. The shielding device is applicable for use in apparatus for screening, separating and grading ores or other like materials, and it will be convenient to hereinafter describe the invention in relation to this exemplary application. It is to be understood, however, that the invention is not limited to such apparatus.<br>
A variety of apparatus systems have been developed for screening, separating and grading ores. A preferred apparatus includes a plurality of screen panels which are fixed to a support frame whereby individual panels can be easily and rapidly removed and replaced when worn. Screening apparatus of this type, with which the invention is concerned, is of any suitable construction well known to those skilled in the art. In that regard, the apparatus will include a support frame typically constructed of frame members for providing underlying support for a screen surface. An array of screen panels are fixed to the frame to formic a continuous screen surface. The screen surface may be flat or cambered such as in deck screen apparatus, or may be curved such as in a trommel or drum screen apparatus. Each screen panel is typically square or rectangular in plan shape, with an upper or inner screening surface for receiving ore to be screened and a lower or outer bearing surface that may bear on the underlying support frame members. Apertures extend through the screen panels between the screening and bearing surfaces to provide for ore screening and separation.<br>
One fixing arrangement used in this apparatus is disclosed in Australian Detent 654091. This patent discloses the use of an elongate U-shaped fixing number for securing to the support frame so as to extend longitudinally between side edge regions of adjacent screen panels. The fixing member has a pair of connection portions, with connection elements being provided along the outer side surfaces of the connection portions and the side edge faces of the screen panels. The connection elements of each connection portion and an associated screen   to hold the screen panels in position on the support frame. The<br><br>
connection portions are inwardly deflectable away from the side edge faces in order to disengage the connection elements and disconnect the screen panels from the fixing member. A retaining member is provided for extending along the fixing member in engagement with the connection portions to resist their inadvertent deflection, and thus maintain engagement between the connection elements.<br>
Another system for fixing the screen panels to the support frame incorporates an elongate fixing member to which a pair of panels are able to be secured. The fixing member is securable to an upper surface of the support frame and is adapted to extend between and below facing side edges of adjacent screen panels. In this arrangement, each of these side edges of the panels include downwardly projecting connecting portions which are cooper able with an adjacent portion of the fixing member. The system further includes a retaining member which is engageable with the panels so as to clamp each connection portion between the fixing member and the retaining member such that each screen panel is secured to the support frame.<br>
In use, the whole apparatus including the support frame and panels is vibrated so that the material is able to move across the screen surface. While these fixing systems are effective in retaining the panels to the support frame, fine grade material, commonly referred to as "fines", is prone to ingress in between the component parts of the apparatus. These fines are highly abrasive and increase wear on the components. The panels and the fixing members are typically formed from a plastics material, such as polyurethane, and are consumables. Consequently the wear of the panels and fixing members is expected and is not a major problem. However the fines are also able to lodge in between the fixing member and frame members of the support frame and as the support frame is not a consumable, this can cause excessive wear to the screening apparatus.<br>
Typically the support frame is formed from steel and the ingress of fines into contact with frame members can cause pitting of the steel which can accelerate corrosion of the frame. In an effort to prevent this, resin coatings have been applied to the vulnerable frame surfaces. However this approach has only provided a short term solution as over time, the fines wear through the coating.<br><br>
An aim of the invention is to provide another solution to this problem.<br>
In its broadest terms, the present invention provides a shielding device for a frame member in screening apparatus of the type having at least one screen Danel securable to a support frame wherein the device includes an elongate body Dortion locatable between a screen panel and a frame member of the support rame and at least one projecting portion, wherein the body portion and the jrojecting portion provide at least one surface which, in use of the shielding levice, extends below an edge region of the screen panel for collecting material hat passes over or through that edge region and deflecting it away from the frame nember.<br>
Preferably the or each projecting portion is a skirt that projects from the )ody portion.<br>
An advantage of the present invention is that in operation of the screening ipparatus any fines which ingress through the fixing arrangement of the ipparatus or the screening apertures of a screen panel overlying the support rame are deflected away from the support frame. A further advantage is that the ihielding device is able to minimise the abrasive effects of the fines by deflecting he material out of the screening apparatus. Further, the shielding device can be nanufactured and supplied as a consumable and if required can be easily epiaced when the other consumables of the screening apparatus, such as screen »anels and fixing members, are replaced.<br>
The invention is described herein with reference to the screening apparatus 1 a normal use orientation wherein it has an horizontally extending screen deck rame, and terms such as "above", "upward", "downward", "upper" and "lower" hould be construed in the light of this orientation. However, it is to be understood iiat other orientations may be equally possible and that consequential changes in 5rms such as those above may be required in the light of those orientations.<br>
Preferably the body portion includes means for retaining the shielding levice over a frame member in the screening apparatus.<br>
In one form, the screening apparatus includes a fixing member securable to an upper surface of a frame member of the support frame and wherein an edge region of the screen panel is adapted to be secured to the fixing member through<br><br>
an arrangement of inter-fitting projections and recesses. When used in this arrangement, the shielding device is adapted to extend below the fixing member and over the frame member to deflect material passing between the panel and the fixing member away from the upper surface of the frame member. Alternatively the shielding device may be an integrally formed part of the fixing member.<br>
A shielding device according to the present invention is particularly suitable for use with a fixing system in screening apparatus that includes a fixing member that is fixedly locatable adjacent an edge face of a screen panel. However it is to be appreciated that the shielding device may be employed in other fixing arrangements, such as when a screen panel is adapted to overlay a fixing member.<br>
In one form, the shielding device includes a retaining lug with which another part of the screening apparatus is engageable for retaining the device over a frame member. Preferably this lug upstands from an upper surface of the body portion. In this arrangement the retaining lug is adapted to abut a fixing member and/or a screen panel to inhibit relative movement therebetween. In another form, the shielding device includes an aperture for passage of a fastener for securing the device to a frame member. In one form, the fastener may also secure a fixing member to the support frame member.<br>
In one form, the device includes a pair of skirts, each of which projects from a respective longitudinal side of the body portion, the skirts extending continuously along the body portion sides. This arrangement is particularly advantageous for use with two adjacent screen panels as the shielding device can deflect any fines away from the respective panels in opposite directions.<br>
A shielding device according to the invention is preferably formed in continuous lengths and may extend along either the entire length of a frame member or part thereof with the projecting portion or skirt extending laterally beyond a side edge of the frame member.<br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a shielding device for a support beam of a support frame in screening apparatus of the type having at least one screen panel securable to the support frame, the device including: an elongate body portion for extending along the support beam so as to be located between the support beam and an edge region of the screen panel which extends along the support beam, and at least one projecting portion, the body portion and the projecting portion providing at least one surface which, in use of the shielding device, extends along below the edge region of the screen panel for collecting material that passes over or through that edge region and deflecting it away from the support beam.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention also provides screening apparatus including: a support frame having support beams, at least one screen panel having opposite edge regions supported on and secured to respective support beams, and a plurality of shielding devices according to any preceding claim located between the screen panel(s) and each support beam for collecting material that passes over or through the edge regions and deflecting it away from the support beams.<br>
For a better understanding of the invention, embodiments thereof will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawing. The specific form and arrangement of the various features shown in the drawing is not to be understood as limiting on the invention, the scope of which is<br><br>
to be determined according to the generality of the preceding description. It is also to be understood that the specific form of a feature of the invention as shown in one embodiment may be applied to or interchanged for the specific form of a corresponding feature as shown in another embodiment.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates a partially exploded end view of screening apparatus incorporating shielding devices according to two embodiments of the present invention.<br>
The screening apparatus shown in Figure 1 is based on the screening apparatus which is described in detail in the applicant's previous Australian patent no. 654091. However, it is to be understood that the shielding devices may be incorporated in other screening apparatus such as drum or trommel screens or the like and may be used with fixing arrangements other than those described hereinafter.<br>
In the illustrated arrangement, the deck screening apparatus 1 includes a support frame 2 which includes parallel spaced frame members in the form of support beams 3 extending along the screen deck. The screen deck support frame 2 also includes side structures 4 (only one of which is shown at the right hand side), each including a side beam 5 fixed to a support beam 3.<br>
A plurality of screen panels 6 forming an array are fixed to, and supported by, an upper surface 7 of the frame support beams 3 with each screen panel 6 being supported by a pair of the support beams 3. Each screen panel 6 is typically flat, and has a square or rectangular plan shape, with an upper screening surface 8 for receiving ore or other material to be screened and a lower bearing surface 9. Each screen panel 6 has a pair of opposed side edge regions 10. Apertures (not shown) extend through each screen panel 6 between the screening and bearing surfaces 8, 9 to provide the ore screening and separation.<br>
The screen panels 6 are preferably cast or moulded from a plastics material, such as polyurethane, and may be internally reinforced with one or more metal elements, such as steel bars (not shown). It is to be understood that alternative materials and methods of production for the screen panels 6 are possible.<br><br>
The screening apparatus 1 includes a fixing system for releasably fixing the screen panels 6 to the frame support beams 3. This fixing system includes fixing members 13 which are in the form of elongate rails, each of which extends along a respective support beam 3 so that the fixing rails 13 are in parallel spaced apart relation and positioned between adjacent screen panels 6. Each fixing rail 13 includes an elongate base portion 14 and a pair of connection portions 15 extending along and upstanding from the base portion 14. The connection portions 15 are laterally spaced and thus define a clearance groove 16 therebetween. Thus, each fixing rail 13 has a generally U-shaped cross sectional profile defined by the base portion 14 and upstanding connection portions 15.<br>
Connection elements in the form of ribs 17 are formed on the side edge faces of screen panels 6. These ribs 17 are adapted to interfit with grooves formed in the connection portions 15 of the fixing members 13 to hold the screen panels in position on the support frame. In this way the fixing members 13 are located between adjacent screen panels 6.<br>
The connection portions 15 of a fixing rail 13 are deflectable away from the facing side edge faces of adjacent screen panels in order to disengage the connection elements or ribs 17 and disconnect a screen panel 6 from the fixing rails 13 to allow removal of the panel. Retaining elements 18 are provided, each of which has a plug portion 11 beatable within the clearance groove 16 of a fixing rail 13 to resist inadvertent deflection of the connection portions 15 thus maintaining the screen panels 6 in engagement with the fixing rails 13.<br>
The apparatus 1 also includes a clamp member in the form of a bar 19 extending along the side beam 5. Bar 19 is held in position by clamp members spaced along side beam 5. The clamp members 19 (there is one along each side) are arranged such that the outermost side edge regions 10 of the screen panels 6 (adjacent side beams 5) are clamped to the frame support beams 3.<br>
In this embodiment, the lower edge 20 of a clamp bar 19 is shaped to fit or mate with a side edge region 10 of adjacent screen panels 6 and thereby facilitate screen panel fixing. To that end the lower edge 20 of the clamp bar is laterally stepped so as to provide a relief section 21 into which an upper corner of the side edge region 10 of the screen panels 6 is received.  Thus the clamp members 19<br><br>
are clamped down onto the upper surface 8 of the screen panels 6 and also fit into a gap 22 between the screen panels 6 and adjacent side beams 5. That fit can be an interference fit so as to apply a transverse force to the panels 6 which acts to press the screen panels into engagement with a fixing rail 13 along the opposite sides of the panels.<br>
According to the invention the screening apparatus 1 further includes elongate shielding devices 23, 24 which are locatable between the screen panels 6 and the support beams 3. These shielding devices are for preventing fines which may ingress between the component parts of the screen panel fixing arrangement or through the screening apertures of a panel 6 that are proximate the side edge regions 10 thereof from coming into contact with the support beams 3.<br>
Two forms of a shielding device are disclosed; device 23 is for location under a fixing rail 13 and device 24 is for location against a side beam 5.<br>
The shielding device 23 includes an elongate body portion 25 which is substantially planar and which is locatable between a fixing member 13 and a support beam 3. The body portion 25 is of a width to extend across the entire width of the upper surface 7 of the support beam 3. The shielding device 23 further includes a pair of projecting portions in the form of skirts 26 extend continuously along, and which project laterally from, opposite edges of the body portion 25 and are downwardly angled. Thus the shielding device 23 provides an upper surface 27 which collects any fines or slurry of the ore which works its way between a fixing member 13 and the adjacent panels 6 as the ore being screened passes over the upper surface of the screen deck. This surface 27 joins with the upper surfaces 27a of skirts 26 which deflect the collected fines away from the support beam 3. The surfaces 27 and 27a may be smoothly joined such that there is, effectively, a single surface for collecting and deflecting the fines, for example, the skirts 26 could be curved. The invention also includes within its scope projecting portions that are not angled relative to the body portion such that a substantially flat upper surface for collecting and deflecting the fines is provided.<br>
Each fixing rail 13 is mounted to a support beam 3 by any suitable arrangement.    In the illustrated embodiment, the rails 13 are bolted to the<br><br>
underlying support beams 3 by means of spaced bolts 30 carried by the base portion 14 and depending therefrom through apertures (not shown) in the beams 3. With this arrangement, the body portion 25 of a shielding device 23 also includes apertures 28 for passage of the bolts 30. Alternatively the shielding device 23 may be an integrally formed part of fixing rail 13.<br>
The shielding device 24, similarly to the device 23, is for deflecting material passing over the outermost side edge region 10 of a screen panel 6 that may ingress between the panel, clamp bar 19 and side beam 5 from depositing on the underlying frame member 3. As the shielding device 24 is for mounting adjacent a side beam 5 only a single skirt 26 projecting from the body portion 25 is required. Shielding device 24 includes a retaining lug 29 which upstands from the body portion 25 and is sized for location within the gap 22 formed between the side beam 5 and an adjacent screen panel 6. This retaining lug 29 inhibits relative movement between the screen panel 6 and the frame beam 3. The projecting portion of shielding device 24, as in the device 23, need not be a skirt, that is, a downwardly angled or curved portion, but could extend substantially straight out from the body portion.<br>
The shielding devices 23 and 24 may be cast or moulded in one piece from plastics material, such as polyurethane. Typically the shielding devices are cast into lengths which are similar to the lengths of the fixing rails 13. However it is to be appreciated that the shielding devices may be of shorter length if desired.<br>
In operation of the screening apparatus 1 the frame members or support beams 3 carrying the screen panels 6 are vibrated to cause the ore to move across the upper surfaces 8 of the respective screen panels. During this operation any material, such as fines or slurry which works its way over the edge regions 10 of the screen panels 6 or through the screen apertures which overlie the support beams 3 will be deposited on one of the shielding devices 23 or 24. On continued operation of the screening apparatus 1, this material will tend to work towards the edges of the body portion 25 of the shielding devices, onto the projecting portion(s) or skirt(s) and then over its or their edges thus deflecting it away from the frame members. The upper surfaces 7 of the frame support beams<br><br>
3 are best protected by projecting portions in the form of skirts 26 as these depend below those upper surfaces.<br>
Due to the abrasive nature of the fines, over time the shielding devices, in particular the body portions 25, will wear down and require replacement. However, it is expected that the wearing of the shielding devices will not be any greater than the other consumable parts of the screening apparatus such as the fixing rails 13. As a consequence these component parts can be replaced together during a regular overhaul of the system.<br>
The invention described herein is susceptible to variations, modifications and/or additions other than those specifically described and it is to be understood that the invention includes all such variations, modifications and/or additions which fall within the spirit and scope of the following claims.<br><br><br>
