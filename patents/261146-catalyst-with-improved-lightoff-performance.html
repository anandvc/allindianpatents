Catalyst with improved lightoff performance<br>
Description<br>
The present invention addresses metallic honeycombs as<br>
supports for a coating of catalyst material for the<br>
exhaust gas cleaning of internal combustion engines.<br>
What is desired from the honeycombs is firstly a large<br>
geometric surface area to accommodate the coating and<br>
secondly a low heat capacity in order that the<br>
honeycomb warms up rapidly to the operating temperature<br>
of the catalyst. In addition, a sufficient mechanical<br>
stability is required from the honeycombs in order to<br>
withstand the mechanical stresses through the pulsating<br>
gas flow and the vibrations of engine and vehicle.<br>
Moreover, the material of the honeycomb has to be<br>
resistant to the corrosive exhaust gas atmosphere at<br>
high temperatures.<br>
The catalytic coating of a finished catalyst consists<br>
of finely divided thermally stable metal oxides on<br>
whose surface are deposited catalytically active<br>
platinum group metals. Suitable metal oxides are, for<br>
example, aluminum oxide, titanium oxide, silicon oxide,<br>
cerium oxide, zirconium oxide, zeolites and mixtures or<br>
mixed oxides thereof, and stabilizers such as lanthanum<br>
oxide and barium oxide. To apply these materials to the<br>
honeycomb, the pulverulent materials are, for example,<br>
suspended in water. Subsequently, this coating<br>
suspension is deposited onto the honeycombs by known<br>
processes, dried and consolidated by calcining.<br>
The honeycombs may be of different structure. Even at a<br>
very early stage, spiral-wound honeycombs were used.<br>
They consist of one smooth and one corrugated sheet<br>
layer which, are placed one on top of another and then<br>
wound up in a spiral and inserted into an outer tube.<br><br>
The two sheet layers form channels through which the<br>
exhaust gas can flow and enter into intensive contact<br>
with the catalytic coating.<br>
In another design, the honeycomb is formed from a<br>
multitude of smooth and corrugated sheet layers, or<br>
differently corrugated sheet layers, arranged in<br>
alternation, in which case the sheet layers first form<br>
one or more stacks which are intertwined with one<br>
another. The ends of the sheet layers are -on the<br>
outside and can be bonded with an outer tube. This<br>
forms many connections between sheet layers and outer<br>
tube, which increase the mechanical strength of the<br>
honeycomb.<br>
The material used for the sheet layers are preferably<br>
aluminum-containing steel alloys, which are marketed,<br>
for example, under the trade name FeCrAlloy®. This is<br>
an iron-chromium-aluminum alloy. The thickness of' the<br>
sheet layers is usually between 20 and 80 µm,<br>
preferably 50 µm.<br>
It has been known for some time that the sheet layers<br>
can be provided with perforations and corrugations in<br>
order to influence the flow within the channels and/or<br>
to achieve transverse mixing between the individual<br>
flow channels. It is likewise known that slotted sheets<br>
can be used for the construction of metallic<br>
honeycombs. US 5,599,509 proposes, for example,<br>
equipping the sheets with slots transverse to the flow<br>
direction of the exhaust gas in the entrance region of<br>
the honeycomb in order to reduce the heat capacity of<br>
the honeycomb in this region in a controlled manner.<br>
As a result of the reduced thermal conductivity and<br>
heat capacity in the front part, the catalyst coating<br>
applied reaches its lightoff temperature more rapidly<br>
and hence also achieves a better conversion, for<br><br>
example for carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons. However,<br>
the improvement in the conversion depends significantly<br>
upon the percentage slot area of the sheet layers. The<br>
conversion is improved only within a range of slot<br>
areas between 20 and 50%. Above 50%, the hydrocarbon<br>
conversion decreases again because the catalyst<br>
material available decreases with increasing slot area<br>
and equal thickness of the catalyst layer. The<br>
improvements in the conversion are therefore observed<br>
only in the warm up phase. After the warmup phase, the<br>
reduced amount of catalyst material leads to a worsened<br>
conversion of the harmful substances in the exhaust<br>
gas. Moreover, such a catalyst, owing to the small<br>
amount of catalyst material, has a low aging<br>
resistance. Furthermore, the perforation in the sheet<br>
layers increases the back pressure of the catalyst,<br>
since turbulence forms at the holes. If the intention<br>
were to apply the same mass of catalyst material as in<br>
the case of an unperforated support with the same<br>
geometry to such a catalyst support, the layer<br>
thickness of the catalyst layer and hence likewise the<br>
back pressure of the catalyst would inevitably<br>
increase.<br>
DE 103 14 085 A1 likewise describes metallic honeycombs<br>
composed of at least partly perforated sheet layers.<br>
The aim of the perforations is to enable transverse<br>
mixing of the exhaust gas streams of different flow<br>
channels. In the coating, it is therefore ensured that<br>
the holes are not closed by the coating suspension. For<br>
this reason, the honeycombs are coated in a vibration<br>
unit which generates a relative motion between the<br>
coating suspension and the support body and hence<br>
prevents closure of the holes.<br>
US 5,821,194 describes a metallic honeycomb composed of<br>
smooth and corrugated sheet layers. To improve the<br>
adhesion of a pre-coating material, the sheet layers<br><br>
are equipped with a multitude of holes, into which the<br>
pre-coating composition penetrates in the course of<br>
coating and forms a mechanical anchor between sheet<br>
layers and coating material. For this purpose, the<br>
diameter of the holes is about half the size of the<br>
thickness of the sheet layers and is thus from 25 to<br>
35 µm. The holes are arranged at a distance of about<br>
1 mm from one another.<br>
The present invention shall avoid the disadvantages<br>
known from the prior art of perforated sheet layers. It<br>
is an object of the invention to compensate for the<br>
loss of support surface through the hole surface of the<br>
sheet layers by means of suitable measures.<br>
This object is achieved by a catalyst for the cleaning<br>
of the exhaust gases of internal combustion engines,<br>
which comprises a honeycomb composed of smooth and<br>
corrugated metal sheets with an entrance end face and<br>
an exit end face for the exhaust gases, the metal<br>
sheets being provided with holes to reduce their heat<br>
capacity and a catalyst material having been applied to<br>
the metal sheets. The catalyst is characterized in that<br>
the holes and/or slots of the metal sheets are filled<br>
substantially with catalyst material and the hole area<br>
of all holes together is 5 to 80% of the area of the<br>
metal sheets.<br>
In contrast to US 5,599,509, the holes and slots in the<br>
sheet layers according to the present invention are<br>
filled with catalyst material. The filling with<br>
catalyst material or with a pre-coating is effected<br>
directly in the coating operation; no additional<br>
working steps are required. When the same amount of<br>
catalyst material is used as finds use in the case of<br>
supports of the same geometry without perforations, the<br>
heat capacity is reduced by the proportion of the<br><br>
perforations in the sheet layers. The physical data in<br>
Table 1 can serve to estimate these effects:<br>
Table 1: Physical data of FeCrAlloy and catalyst layer<br>
composed of aluminum oxide in comparison<br><br>
The advantage according to the invention is that the<br>
perforations of the sheet layers do not lead to a<br>
reduction in the amount of catalyst material. As a<br>
consequence, the inventive catalyst, as a result of the<br>
reduced heat capacity of the support, reaches its<br>
lightoff temperature very rapidly and then displays the<br>
full activity of the unreduced amount of catalyst<br>
coating. Furthermore, the inventive catalyst, owing to<br>
the higher loading concentration with catalyst<br>
material, has an improved aging stability over<br>
conventional perforated catalysts.<br>
Of course, it would also be possible to apply the same<br>
coating concentration in accordance with the prior art<br>
without closing the holes on the honeycomb. However,<br>
the coating thickness would then inevitably be<br>
significantly greater and would thus lead to a higher<br>
flow resistance of the catalyst.<br>
To prepare the inventive catalyst, the properties of<br>
the coating suspension have to be adjusted to the hole<br>
dimensions in order to ensure complete filling of<br>
substantially all holes with catalyst material. Low<br>
viscosity coating suspensions can close only small<br>
holes; viscous coating suspensions, in contrast, cover<br>
even relatively large holes. The person skilled in the<br><br>
art can easily determine the optimal conditions by a<br>
few preliminary experiments.<br>
The shape of the holes need not be circular. The hole<br>
area coverable by the coating suspension is dependent<br>
upon the type of holes and the properties of the<br>
coating suspension. Generally, the area of the<br>
individual holes may be from 0.1 to 25 mm2. In the case<br>
of circular holes, a hole area of from 0.1 up to 1 mm2<br>
has been found to be useful; in the case of elongated<br>
holes, the hole area, in contrast, may be selected<br>
between 0.25 and 25 mm2, preferably between 0.25 and<br>
5 mm2. Within the context of the restrictions<br>
mentioned, the holes can therefore be round,<br>
elliptical, oval, square, rectangular, slot-shaped or<br>
polygonal.<br>
When the above requirements with regard to the<br>
properties of the coating suspension and the hole<br>
dimensions are observed, the known coating processes by<br>
dipping, pouring-over, sucking-in or pumping-in may be<br>
employed for the actual coating operation. In the<br>
removal of excess coating suspension by blowing with<br>
compressed air, it must, though, be ensured that the<br>
holes closed with the moist catalyst material are not<br>
opened again in this operation.<br>
After the coating suspension has been dried, it is<br>
calcined at from about 300 to 600°C. Thereafter, the<br>
holes are closed with a robust layer of the catalyst<br>
material which withstands the harsh operating<br>
conditions in the exhaust gas line of an internal<br>
combustion engine.<br>
In this way, as in the case of unperforated honeycombs,<br>
according to the coating thickness desired, it is<br>
possible to achieve coating concentrations between 50<br>
and 400 grams per liter of volume of the honeycomb. If<br><br>
the intention were to apply the same coating<br>
concentration without closing the holes, the coating<br>
thickness on the sheets would have to be increased<br>
correspondingly.<br>
For the production of the honeycomb, preference is<br>
given to using all sheet layers, both the smooth and<br>
the corrugated sheet layers, in perforated form. The<br>
advantages of the invention are, though - even if in<br>
attenuated form - also realized when, for example, only<br>
the smooth or only the corrugated sheet layers are used<br>
in perforated form.<br>
Furthermore, it may be appropriate to restrict the<br>
perforations only to a particular region of the<br>
honeycomb. It is advantageous, for example, to position<br>
the perforations only in the inflow region of the<br>
honeycomb.<br>
The area of all holes together relative to the total<br>
area A of the sheet layers in the perforated region<br>
determines the achievable reduction in the heat<br>
capacity. According to the invention, the area of all<br>
holes relative to the total area in the perforated<br>
region of the honeycomb is between 5 and 80%. Above<br>
80%, the strength of the honeycomb is too greatly<br>
impaired by the perforations. The hole fraction is<br>
preferably between 5 and 65%, in particular between 20<br>
and 65%.<br>
In addition to the perforations, the sheet layers may<br>
also have corrugations and embossments when the exhaust<br>
gas stream is to be swirled to improve the contact with<br>
the catalytic coating.<br>
It has been found to be particularly advantageous to<br>
use so-called expanded metals for the sheet layers to<br>
construct the honeycomb. An expanded metal refers to a<br><br>
metal sheet with orifices, known as meshes, which are<br>
obtained by offset cuts with simultaneous stretching at<br>
right angles to the cuts without material loss. The<br>
expanded metal has a lattice structure with rhombus-<br>
shaped or slot-shaped meshes. The meshes consist of<br>
strands and the orifice enclosed by them. The crossing<br>
points of the strands are referred to as node points.<br>
The size of a mesh is given by mesh length and mesh<br>
width. The mesh length is the distance from node point<br>
center to node point center in the direction of the<br>
long diagonal. The same applies to the mesh width. A<br>
further characteristic of expanded metals is the width<br>
of their strands.<br>
In the production of expanded metal from a metal sheet,<br>
the width of the metal sheet at right angles to the<br>
stretching direction is maintained, since the strands<br>
are elongated in the punching step because the as yet<br>
unpunched sheet resists deformation before the punching<br>
step. This forms a corrugated, plastically structured<br>
surface of the expanded metal. When a smooth surface is<br>
desired, the expanded metal can be rolled flat after<br>
the stretching. An expanded metal can be produced with<br>
a free cross-sectional area between 4 and about 90%.<br>
For the inventive catalyst, the smooth or corrugated<br>
metal sheets or both sheet types may consist of an<br>
expanded metal. The mesh length is preferably between<br>
0.5 and 5 mm with stretching between 5 and 80%,<br>
preferably between 10 and 50%. Good results are<br>
achieved with an expanded metal with stretching of 30%.<br>
Stretching of 30% means that the expanded metal, after<br>
production, has 1.3 times the length of the starting<br>
sheet. Such a sheet thus has a free hole area of about<br>
23% and a mass reduced by this percentage compared to a<br>
conventional sheet of the same length.<br><br>
The corrugated surface of the expanded metal has an<br>
advantageous effect on the catalytic action of the<br>
finished catalyst, since it swirls the exhaust gas<br>
within the flow channels of the catalyst and hence<br>
improves the contact with the catalyst coating.<br>
However, it increases the exhaust gas back pressure.<br>
When this is not desired, the expanded metals can be<br>
flattened by rolling before the catalyst body is<br>
formed.<br>
The inventive catalysts are used for cleaning the<br>
exhaust gas of internal combustion engines. The<br>
catalytic coating may be adjusted to the specific<br>
requirements of the exhaust gas composition. The<br>
coating may comprise an oxidation catalyst, three-way<br>
catalyst, nitrogen oxide storage catalyst or SCR<br>
catalyst. The inventive catalyst can be used in motor<br>
vehicles with gasoline or diesel engines, both as a<br>
starting catalyst close to the engine or as an<br>
underfloor catalyst. The catalyst is particularly<br>
advantageous for cleaning the exhaust gas of motorized<br>
bicycles and water vehicles.<br>

invention. They show:<br>

proportions<br>

holes with a diameter of 0.8 mm. The perforations of<br>
Figures 1 and 2 differ by the distance of the holes<br>
from one another and the percentage hole area which is<br>
different as a result. According to Figure 1, the hole<br>
area is 50% of the perforated sheet region, while the<br>
hole area' is only 25% according to the perforation of<br>
Figure 2.<br>
Figures 3 and 4 show perforations with elongated holes<br>
of different size and percentage hole area.<br>
Simulation calculations<br>
To demonstrate the advantages of the inventive<br>
catalyst, simulation calculations were undertaken. As<br>
the basis for the simulations, the exhaust gas values,<br>
i.e. harmful substance concentrations and exhaust gas<br>
temperature, of a motorcycle with a 1200 cm3 four-<br>
stroke engine were measured in the EU3 test cycle as a<br>
function of test time.<br>
For the calculation of the harmful substance<br>
conversion, two metal honeycombs with a cell density of<br>
360 cm-2, a diameter of 90 mm and a length of 74.5 mm<br><br>
were assumed. The metal sheets consisting of FeCrAlloy<br>
had a thickness of 50 µm. For a comparative<br>
calculation, it was assumed that the honeycomb is<br>
constructed from unperforated metal sheets, while, for<br>
the example calculation, it was assumed that the<br>
honeycomb has perforated metal sheets with a hole area<br>
of 50%. The catalyst coating specified was a three-way<br>
catalyst with platinum, palladium and rhodium with a<br>
noble metal concentration of 1.48 g/1 of honeycomb<br>
volume, equal in both cases.<br>
The results of the measurements and calculations are<br>
shown in Figure 5 for the first 200 seconds of the EU3<br>
cycle. "V" denotes the speed profile of the motorcycle<br>
according to the test cycle. T1 is the measured<br>
temperature profile of the exhaust gas before entry<br>
into the catalyst.<br>
Curve T2 in Figure 5 shows the calculated temperature<br>
profile behind the unperforated comparative catalyst,<br>
while curve T3 shows the temperature profile behind the<br>
perforated example catalyst. It can be seen clearly<br>
that, owing to the perforation of the example catalyst,<br>
it heats significantly more rapidly. Thus, the<br>
perforated catalyst reaches a temperature of 250°C at<br>
At = 13 s earlier than the unperforated comparative<br>
catalyst.<br>
Example 1: Comparative catalyst (catalyst A):<br>
A cylindrical metal honeycomb composed of unperforated<br>
metal foils of 0.05 mm thickness, a diameter of 90 mm,<br>
a length of 74.5 mm and a cell density of 200 cm-2 was<br>
coated with a conventional three-way catalyst<br>
comprising platinum, palladium and rhodium with a noble<br>
metal concentration of 1.55 g/1 of honeycomb volume.<br>
Example 2: Inventive catalyst (catalyst B):<br><br>
For comparison of the catalytic properties, a further<br>
supported metal catalyst with the same dimensions, foil<br>
thicknesses and the same cell density as the<br>
comparative catalyst was produced. Instead of<br>
unperforated metal foils, however, an expanded metal<br>
with a stretching of 30% and a mesh length of 0.6, a<br>
mesh width of 0.5 and a strand width of 0.18 mm was<br>
used. The metal support was coated with the same three-<br>
way catalyst in the same concentration as the<br>
comparative catalyst.<br>
Figure 6 a) shows a photograph of the structure of the<br>
expanded metal used prior to catalytic coating.<br>
Figure 6 b) shows a corresponding photograph after<br>
catalytic coating. It can be seen clearly that the mesh<br>
orifices of the expanded metal have been filled<br>
completely with catalyst material. The catalyst<br>
material adhered in an outstanding manner on the<br>
expanded metal and showed no detachment even in the<br>
case of blowing with compressed air and knocking.<br>
Back pressure measurements:<br>
Owing to its three-dimensionally structured surface,<br>
the inventive catalyst support B without coating<br>
The back pressure of the two supported metal catalysts<br>
was determined prior and after catalytic coating with a<br>
mass flow rate of 300 m3 (STP)/h (m3 (STP) = standard<br>
m3). The results are reproduced in Table 2 below.<br><br><br>
exhibits a significantly higher back pressure than the<br>
metal support comprising the unperforated metal foils.<br>
After the catalyst coating has been applied, the back<br>
pressure of the comparative catalyst increases by 58%<br>
from 5.9 to 9.4 mbar. In the case of the inventive<br>
catalyst support composed of expanded metal foils, the<br>
back pressure after the coating increases only by 22%<br>
from 8.2 to 10.1 mbar. The surprising result is found<br>
here that by filling of the meshes of the expanded<br>
metal with catalyst material the back pressure<br>
difference becomes negligible between the two catalysts<br>
compared to the back pressure increase between uncoated<br>
and coated catalyst support.<br>
Measurement of the exhaust gas emissions in the<br>
European motorcycle test cycle:<br>
Catalysts A and B were analyzed on a motorcycle with<br>
regard to their exhaust gas emissions in the European<br>
motorcycle test cycle. Figure 7 shows the measurements<br>
of the CO, HC and NOx emissions of the two catalysts<br>
accumulated during the test as a function of driving<br>
time. Figure 7 also shows the speed at which the<br>
motorbike traveled. The emission curves of the<br>
inventive catalyst B for carbon monoxide and<br>
hydrocarbons are significantly below the curves for<br>
comparative catalyst A. The difference in the emission<br>
between the two catalysts is attributable to the cold-<br>
start phase over the first 100 seconds and the reason<br>
for it is the shorter lightoff time of the inventive<br>
catalyst owing to its lower thermal mass. After the<br>
cold-start phase, the two catalysts convert the harmful<br>
substances equally well, since they are coated with the<br>
same amount of catalyst material. As a consequence, the<br>
emission curves run parallel to one another after the<br>
cold-start phase.<br><br>
Table 3 lists the constant volume sampling results for<br>
the harmful substances during this test.<br><br>
The results of Table 3 show that the inventive catalyst<br>
B, based on the comparative catalyst, has an emission<br>
of carbon monoxide reduced by 19%, an emission of THC3<br>
reduced by 31% and an emission of nitrogen oxides<br>
reduced by 19%.<br><br>
