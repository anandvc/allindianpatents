The assembly of the cabinets is such that three cabinets are on three sides, one on each side; and two cabinets on the fourth side. These two cabinets on the fourth side are arranged in such a way that when an underneath lever is pulled, they together move out in opposite directions revealing the sixth cabinet set at the center of ROTABIN. This is invisible and unapproachable from outside unless and until the covering cabinets are separated/pulled apart. Therefore, the front two cabinets ensure a super protection for this cabinet, meaning also that no one will ever know that such a super safe vault is present for this equipment. So the sixth cabinet serves as a super-safe-vault with separate door and lock The equipment, as &amp; whole is mounted on a common base frame with wheels so that it is capable of being shifted any where with less effort. Also it is capable of being rotated about a central vertical axis. Since the equipment is having 6 cabinets, six persons can use ROTABIN, independently. The material of construction can be either wood or CR sheet. The product is made up of simple numerable components so that they can be transported anywhere at ease and assembled at the desired location.. If steel, it can either be spray-painted or powder coated A powder coated one lasts a lifetime where as a spray-painted one lasts roughly 10 years. The main uses of ROTABIN are for scientific management of inventory wherever it may be )ike Library7, stores, Supermarket, houses for personal purposes, hospitals, Medical shops etc.</td>

The cupboard, either made of steel or wood, is meant for storing books, clothes and other articles of our choice. In fact, a conventional cupboard has many limitations: 1) It has only one side, the facing side with doors; 2) It is made to conform to a particular size, and hence much space is gone unutilized in actual use; 3) The space available for storing articles of various nature is very limited; hence less inventory and their indexing too will encounter limitations; 4) The occupying (floor space) space of the cupboard with respect to a certain quantum of articles is substantially high; 5) Articles of value and variety are difficult to be handled together satisfactorily . The "cupboard" I am going to present here is a non-conventional one hitherto not developed/desisted by anybody. It is unique. It helps serve the purposes of storing/display most conveniently, scientifically, safely and economically, setting aside all the limitations cited above. Not only that, it opens the door for more and more convenient applications to suit the needs of the day and the ensuing time whether it be office puipose, personal use, or commercial use. The invention, initially defined and named as 'multisided revolving super safe universal cupboard5 is now given the name "ROTABESP\ which means rotating cabinets. Cabinet means a case for storing or displaying articles of value, H, in fact, is a combination of 6 cabinets set and assembled as an elegant single entity. Henceforth, the word "cupboard" will be replaced by the words either "ROTABIN" or "CABINET," as the case may be. This change is necessitated due to "Time Factor". There is no product available in the market, either the same or substantially the same, whose characteristics, design wise, performance wise and operation wise, could be compared with those of ROTABIN. As mentioned earlier, it is unique. (A few digital photographs of the product, ROTABIN, from various angles, are enclosed at the end as Drg. Nos 20 to 24, sheet no 17).<br>
The invention, ROTABIN, is unique furniture. It is having a square section and has a combination of six cabinets with adjustable shelves, independent doors and locks. The assembly of the cabinets is such that three cabinets are on three sides, one on each side; and two cabinets on the fourth side. These two cabinets on the fourth side are arranged in such away that when an underneath lever is pulled, they together move out in opposite directions revealing the sixth cabinet set at the center of ROTABIN. This is invisible and unapproachable from outside unless and until the covering cabinets are separated/pulled apart. For this cabinet, therefore, the front two cabinets ensure a super protection. So the sixth cabinet serves as a super-safe-vault with separate door and lock. The equipment consisting" of simple and numerous components to enable transportation and assembly at any place, easy, is, as a whole, mounted on a common base frame with wheels so that it is capable of beinj^ shifted any where with less effort. Also, it is capable of being rotated about a central vertical axis. Since the equipment is having 6 cabinets, six persons can use ROTABIN, independently and simultaneously too.<br>
The above and other features of the invention including various novel details of construction and combination of parts will now be more particularly described with reference to the accompanying 24 drawings on sheet nos 1 to 17 and pointed out in the<br><br>
claims. It will be understood that the particular product, ROTABIN, embodying the invention is shown by way of illustration only and not as a limitation of the invention.

How to operate:<br>
Rotate the equipment to choose a particular peripheral cabinet. Open the door and place the books/materials inside one by one. After filling it close the door and lock it. Rotate the equipment again for the next side cabinet Repeat the process and complete the other sides as well. When all the cabinets on the periphery are filled and you want to keep some valuable documents/materials in the central super safe cabinet, rotate the equipment and bring the front side (the side having the two cabinets) face to face. Pull the underneath lever forward (towards the person who pulls it) after unlocking it. The two cabinets move apart sideways revealing the central cabinet inside. Open its door and fill it with whatever valuable materials you want to and close the door and lock it. No body will ever know that kuch a super safe vault is present. Afterwards push the lever backward and lock. All is very safe now.<br>
The cupboard could be manufactured in any well-equipped production center. The machinery required are: 1) Shearing Machine, 2) Bending Machine, 3) Arc Welding Set, 4) Spot Welding Set, 5) Lathe, 6) Chain Block, 4) spray painting unit or powder coating unit It is better to apply powder coating on the body of the equipment rather than spray painting. The powder coating lasts about a lifetime where as the spray painting lasts only 10 years.<br>
It is to be understood that the present invention is by no means limited to the particular construction herein disclosed mid /or shown in the drawings? but also comprises any modification/equivalents within the scope of the disclosure. The main uses of ROTABIN are for scientific management of inventory wherever it may be like Library, stores, Supermarket, houses for personal purposes, Hospitals, Medical shops etc.<br><br><br><br><br>
