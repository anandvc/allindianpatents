CUTTING TOOL AND CUTTING INSERT THEREFOR<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to cutting tools of the type in which a cutting insert is resiliently clamped in a self-retaining manner in an insert pocket.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Cutting tools employing a resilient clamping mechanism for clamping cutting inserts are generally of relatively narrow thickness, typically in the range of 0.5 mm to 12 mm and the cutting insert is retained in an insert pocket located between the clamping surfaces of upper and lower jaws of the cutting tool. In cutting operations such as grooving and parting off the cutting tool is in the form of a holder blade. The holder blade is, in turn, generally clamped in a blade-retaining block. The holder blade is generally provided with a suitably designed opening, in the vicinity of the insert pocket whereby a relatively narrow bridging portion is formed enabling a limited degree of resilient displacement of one of the holder blade's jaws relative to the other. Generally, the lower jaw is rigid and the upper jaw is resiliently displaceable. The opening can be of the form of an aperture, or a slot, or a slot terminating in an aperture. Examples of such cutting tools are disclosed in U.S. Patent No 3,785,021, U.S. Patent No<br><br>
WO 2005/099949	_2_	PCT/1L2005/000307<br>
4,580,930 and U.S. Patent No 5,829,924. A rotary slot-cutting tool employing a resilient insert clamping mechanism is disclosed in U.S. Patent No 4,417,833. The cutter body is disc-shaped and of relatively narrow thickness, with, cutting insert pockets located around its periphery. As with the holder blade, an insert pocket of a rotary slot-cutting tool has two jaws between which, an insert is clamped by means of the resilient force resulting from the displacement of the clamping jaw.<br>
Whether the cutting tool is a holder blade or a rotary slot cutting tool, the displacement of the clamping jaw is obtained by manufacturing the insert pocket so that the distance between the clamping surfaces of the jaws is smaller than the height of the portion of the insert located between the clamping surfaces. Consequently, when an insert is located in the insert pocket, the clamping jaw is held in a displaced position creating an elastic force by means of which the insert is clamped in position.<br>
A well-known problem with cutting tools of the type described above is that the cutting insert is not positively secured in the insert pocket and therefore can become dislodged during cutting operations. For example, this can happen during grooving operations when attempting to withdraw the holder blade from a workpiece. In some cases the cutting insert can be completely pulled out of the holder blade and become embedded in the workpiece. This problem can be especially troubling with rotary slot-cutting tools where the cutting insert can even fly out of the insert pocket under the influence of centrifugal forces, a situation that can be particularly dangerous when operating at high speeds.<br>
It Is an object of the present invention to provide a catting tool with a resilient clamping mechanism in which the above referred to disadvantage is substantially reduced or overcome.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Attention is first drawn to Figs. 1 and 2 showing two cutting tools in accordance with the present invention. Fig. 1 shows a first cutting tool 10 used for metal cutting operations such as grooving and parting off.<br><br>
WO 2005/099949	6	PCT/1L2005/0003O7<br>
The first cutting tool 10 comprises an insert holder 12 in the form of a rectangular blade with a cutting insert 14 resiliently retained in an insert pocket 16. The cutting insert 14 is typically manufactured by form-pressing and sintering carbide powders. Fig. 2 shows a second cutting tool 20, used for rotary slot metal cutting operations. The second cutting tool 20 comprises an insert holder 22 in the form of a circular disc with cutting inserts 14 resiliently retained in identical insert pockets 16 arranged around the periphery of the disc. The cutting tools 10, 20 comprise a cutting section 18 which includes the cutting insert 14, the insert pocket 16 and the immediate vicinity of the insert pocket 16. The cutting section 18 is shown in Fig. 3. It should be noted that directional terms appearing throughout the specification and claims, e.g. "forward", "rear", "upper", "lower", etc., are used as terms of convenience to distinguish the location of various surfaces relative to each other. These terms are defined with reference to Figs. 3, 4 and 5; however, they are used for illustrative purposes only, and are not intended to limit the scope of the appended claims.<br>
Attention is now drawn to Fig. 4. The cutting insert 14 comprises a cutting portion 24 and a locating portion 26. The cutting portion 24 comprises a cutting edge 28 formed at an intersection of a rake surface 30 and a relief surface 32. The cutting insert 14 further comprises an upper surface 34, a lower surface 36 and a peripheral side surface therebetween. The peripheral side surface comprises opposing forward and rear surfaces 38, 40 and opposing side surfaces 42 extending between the forward and rear surfaces 38, 40. The relief surface 32 is located in the forward surface 38 and the rake surface 30 is located in the upper surface 34. A first distance Wl is defined between the forward surface 38 and the rear surface 40. The locating portion 26 extends downwardly from the cutting portion 24 in a direction away from upper surface 34 and comprises opposing forward and rear locating surfaces 44, 46 that converge downwardly. A second distance<br><br>
WO 2005/099949	7	PCT/1L2005/000307<br>
W2 is defined between the forward and the rear locating surfaces 44, 46. Although the first distance Wl is not necessarily constant for the whole of the cutting portion 24 and although the second distance W2 decreases downwardly along the length of the locating portion 26, the cutting portion 24 is wider than the locating portion 26 in a side view of the cutting insert 14, as can be seen in the figures, and especially in Figs. 3 and 4. In other words, the first distance Wl is greater than the second distance W2. The rear locating surface 46 is located in the rear surface 40 and the forward locating surface 44 is located in the lower surface 36. In addition, a lower locating surface 48 is located in. the lower surface 36 opposing the upper surface 34 and extends between the forward surface 38 and the forward locating surface 44.<br>
Referring to Fig. 5, a clamping portion 50 of the insert holder 12, 22 comprises a clamping jaw 52 resiliently connected via a recess 54 to a base jaw 56 forming a single integral piece therewith. The base jaw 56 has an abutment surface 58 adjacent the insert pocket 16, The abutment surface 58 is divided by a base recess 60 into an upper abutment surface 62 along an upper portion thereof and a lower abutment surface 64 along a lower portion thereof. The clamping jaw 52 has a clamping surface 66 adjacent the insert pocket 16 and generally facing opposite the lower abutment surface 64 of the base jaw 56. A third distance W3 is defined between the clamping surface 66 and the lower abutment surface 64. The third distance W3 decreases downwardly. The clamping jaw 52 is further provided with an insert stop surface 68 located at an upper end thereof and generally transverse to the clamping surface 66. The upper and lower abutment surfaces 62, 64 of the base jaw 56 and the clamping surface 66 of the clamping jaw 52 converge downwardly. A through hole 70 located rearwardly of the base jaw 56 is provided for receiving a key to aid in the insertion of the cutting insert 14 into the insert pocket 16 and for removal of<br><br>
WO 2005/099949	8	PCT/1L2005/000307<br>
the cutting insert 14 from of the insert pocket 16, when used in conjunction with the recess 54.<br>
Attention is now drawn to Fig. 6 in which additional features of the cutting insert 14 and the insert holder 12, 22 are shown. The insert stop surface 68 of the insert holder 12, 22 may be of a convex V-shape, and the lower locating surface 48 of the cutting insert 14 may be of a mating concave V-shape. Similarly, the abutment surface 58 of the insert holder 12, 22 may be of a convex V-shape, and the rear surface 40 of the cutting insert 14 may be of a mating concave V-shape. The mating convex and concave surfaces prevent lateral movement of the cutting insert 14 with respect to the insert holder 12, 22. The rake surface 30 may also be provided with a chip forming groove 72. Moreover, the cutting insert 14 may also be provided with side cutting edges 74, formed at the intersection of the side surfaces 42 with the rake surface 30.<br>
Referring back to Fig. 3, it is seen that with the cutting insert 14 retained in the insert pocket 16, the abutment surfaces 62, 64 of the base jaw 56 abut the rear surface 40 of the cutting insert 14, the clamping surface 66 of the clamping jaw 52 abuts the forward locating surface 44 of the cutting insert 14 and the insert stop surface 68 of the clamping jaw 52 abuts the lower locating surface 48 of the cutting insert 14. To avoid the arrangement, of the two sets of convex-concave mating surfaces, from being over constrained, the clamping surface 66 is chosen to be flat and the forward locating surface 44 is chosen to be convex (as shown in Fig. 7). The width dimension W2 is generally greater than the width dimension W3, so that when the locating portion 26 is located in the insert pocket 16, the clamping ja-w 52 is forced away from the base jaw 56 giving rise to a resilient force which clamps the locating portion 26 in the insert pocket 16.<br>
During a rotary slot cutting operation a centrifugal force F operates on  the cutting insert 14. It is clear from Fig. 3 that the clamping<br><br>
WO 2005/099949	-9-	PCT/IL2005/000307<br>
surface 66 of the clamping jaw 52 opposes the force F thus preventing the cutting insert 14 from flying out of the insert pocket 16. On completion of a grooving operation, during withdrawal of the cutting tool 10 from a workpiece, the cutting insert 14 can come into contact with the groove walls giving rise to frictional forces F which operate to extract the cutting insext 14 from the insert pocket 16. However, the presence of the clamping surface 66 of the clamping jaw 52 prevents extraction of the cutting insert 14.<br>
