More specifically, the meter visor 16c of the stay 16 includes rearwardly recessed cowl support portions 38, 3 8 as shown in Fig. 5. The cowl support portions 3 8 . . are disposed at two places on either side of the meter visor 16c. The front cowl 19 has mounting protrusions 39, 3 9 integrally formed on the upper portion thereof. The mounting protrusions 39 .. advance into the cowl support portions 3 8 .. from the forward direction. Metal nuts 40 .. are fitted to the mounting protrusions<br>
3	9 . .  Threaded members 41 . . are then passed through the cowl support portions 3 8 .. from a rearward direction of the meter visor 16c and threadedly engaged with the nuts<br>
4	0 . . Tightening the threaded members 41 .. allows the upper portion of the front cowl 19 to be attached to the meter visor 16c.<br>
[0036]<br>
Referring also to Fig. 7, the front cowl 19 includes mounting protrusions 42, 42 formed integrally therewith on both sides in the rear at the vertically intermediate portion thereof. The mounting protrusions 42 .. advance into areas downward of both sides of the meter support portion 16b of the stay 16. Nuts 43 *. are<br><br>
fitted to the mounting protrusions 42 ..  Hence, threadedly engaging and tightening threaded members 44 . . , which are passed through the meter support portion 16b from above, allows the vertically intermediate portion of the front cowl 19 to be attached to the meter support portion 16b of the stay 16.<br>
[0037]<br>
Reference is now made to Fig. 5.  The stay main portion 16a of the stay 16 includes cowl support portions 45, 45 formed integrally therewith in a protruding condition on both sides at a lower portion thereof.  The cowl support portions 45 .. protrude upwardly. Nuts 46, 46 are fitted to the cowl support portions 45 ..  Hence, threadedly engaging and tightening threaded members 4 7 . . , which are passed through the lower portion of the front cowl 19 on both sides from the forward direction, allows the lower portion of the front cowl 19 to be attached to the lower portion of the stay main portion 16a in the stay 16.<br>
[0038]<br>
Specifically, the front cowl 19 and the stay 16, each being formed to have an outline substantially identical with each other in the front view, are thereby joined together such that the side cover portions 16ab,<br><br>
16ab of the stay main portion 16a cover both left and right sides of the front cowl 19 from an inward direction. This forms an accommodation chamber 4 8 for accommodating the meter unit 17 and the headlight 18 between the front cowl 19 and the stay 16. [0039]<br>
Referring to Figs. 8 and 9, the front cowl 19 includes a pair of left and right headlight support portions 49, 49 integrally formed therewith in a protruding condition on an inner surface thereof upward of the opening 20.  The headlight support portions 49 .. protrude rearwardly.  Each of the headlight support portions 4 9 .. includes a rectangular support hole 50 made therein.  The headlight 18, on the other hand, includes support plates 51, 51 disposed on an upper portion thereof. The support plates 51 .. penetrate through the support holes 50 . . to protrude upwardly. The support plates 51 .. further include through holes 52, 52. In addition, clips 53, 53 are fitted at upper portions of the support plates 51 . . The clips 53 are passed through the through holes 52 .. so as to be in abutment on upper surfaces of the headlight support portions 4 9 ..  Each of the clips 53 .. includes a curved portion 53a that protrudes upwardly, into which an upper end of the<br><br>
support plate 51 is fitted. [0040]<br>
Referring also to Fig. 10, the headlight 18 is supported in the front cowl 19 so as to be swingable about pivots that are formed at portions of abutment between the upper ends of the support plates 51 .. and the curved portions 53a .. of the clips 53 . .  The front cowl 19 includes a sliding surface 56 formed on an inner surface at the lower portion thereof.  The sliding surface<br>
56	follows along an arcuate line having a radius R about the aforementioned pivot, over which a protrusion 54 formed in a protruding condition on a lower portion of the headlight 18 can slide. A nut 55 is embedded in the protrusion 54.  The front cowl 19 further includes a slot<br>
57	extending longitudinally formed in the lower portion thereof.  A bolt 58, which is passed through the slot 57 from a downward direction of the front cowl 19, is threadedly engaged with the nut 55.<br>
[0041]<br>
Accordingly, by loosening the bolt 58, the headlight 18 can swing about the pivots that are formed at the portions of abutment between the upper ends of the support plates 51 .. and the curved portions 53a .. of the clips 53 ..  Tightening the bolt 58, on the other hand,<br><br>
secures the headlight 18 in position. Aiming adjustment of the headlight 18 can thereby be made. [0042]<br>
Referring to Figs. 2, 3, 5, and 6, the stay main portion 16a in the stay 16 includes a large plurality of air vent holes 59, 59 .. disposed in a grid pattern. Moreover, each of the air vent holes 59, 59 .. is disposed in the stay main portion 16a of the stay 16 such that each falls within an area that substantially overlaps the headlight 18 in a front view. [0043]<br>
In addition, the stay main portion 16a of the stay 16 includes a pair of harness insertion holes 60, 61. Such harnesses, for example, as a harness 63 extended from the headlight 18 and harnesses 64, 64 extended from the flashers 3 7 .. are passed through one 6 0 of the pair of harness insertion holes 60, 61. A harness 62 extended from the meter unit 17 may, for example, be passed through the other 61 of the pair of harness insertion holes 60, 61. [0044]<br>
Effects of the first embodiment of the present invention will be described below. The meter unit 17 is mounted in the stay 16 formed of a synthetic resin.<br><br>
Further, the meter visor 16c is integrally formed to cover the meter unit 17 from the forward direction. Consequently, the number of parts used and the number of assembly man-hours required can be minimized to achieve a cost reduction. [0045]<br>
The stay main portion 16a of the stay 16 includes the back plate portion 16aa that substantially covers the headlight 18 from the rearward direction.  The harnesses 62, 63, 64 .., the support portion of the meter unit 17, and the headlight 18 can therefore be hidden.  Moreover, the back plate portion 16aa can be easily formed and promote increased stiffness of the stay main portion 16a. Further, the pair of left and right side cover portions 16ab, 16ab included in the stay main portion 16a can cover the inner surfaces on both sides of the front cowl 19 from the inward direction. This eliminates the need for parts dedicated to covering the inner surfaces on both sides of the front cowl 19. Accordingly, a structure having a reduced number of parts used covers the inner surfaces on both sides of the front cowl 19 from the inward direction for the improved appearance. Moreover, the stay 16, formed from a synthetic resin, allows the side cover portions 16ab .. to be easily formed.<br><br>
The headlight 18 disposed forwardly of the stay 16 is swingably supported by the front cowl 19 that covers the headlight 18. The front cowl 19, in turn, is mounted to the stay 16. Accordingly, the stay 16 serves also as a rear cover of the headlight 18. This promotes further reduction in the number of parts used and the number of assembly man-hours required.<br>
[0047]<br>
The front cowl 19 and the stay 16, each being formed to have an outline substantially identical with each other in the front view, are joined together so as to form therebetween the accommodation chamber 4 8 for accommodating a part of the meter unit 17 and the headlight 18.  The meter unit 17 and the headlight 18 can thereby be brought compactly together, while achieving a good appearance.<br>
[0048]<br>
The stay 16 includes the large plurality of air vent holes 59, 59 ..  Running wind entering a space inside the front cowl 19 through a gap between the front cowl 19 and the headlight 18 effectively circulates through the air vent holes 59, 59 .. in the stay 16, so that running resistance by the running wind can be reduced. Moreover,<br><br>
each of the air vent holes 59, 59 .. is disposed in the stay main portion 16a of the stay 16 such that each falls within the area that substantially overlaps the headlight 18 in the front view.  This allows the running wind entering the space inside the front cowl 19 through the gap between the front cowl 19 and the headlight 18 to flow through the air vent holes 59, 59 .. more smoothly and easily, so that the running resistance can be reduced more. [0049]<br>
The stay main portion 16a of the stay 16 also includes the harness insertion holes 60, 61, through which the harnesses 62, 63, 64 .. can be passed. The harnesses 62, 63, 64 .. can thereby be hidden behind the front cowl 19 and the stay 16 and routed collectively. [0050]<br>
The positioning pin 26 formed on the lower portion of the stay main portion 16a in the stay 16 is inserted in the positioning hole 24 disposed in the bottom bridge 13 of the front fork 12.

[0066]<br>
In addition, the stay main portion 76a of the stay 76 includes a pair of harness insertion holes 116, 117. Such harnesses, for example, as a harness 63 extended from the headlight 18 and harnesses 118, 118 extended from the flashers 97 .. are passed through one  116 of the pair of harness insertion holes 116, 117. A harness 119 extended from the meter unit 77 may, for example, be passed through the other one 117 of the pair of harness insertion holes 116, 117.<br>
[0067]<br>
The harnesses 63, 118 .., 119 passed through the harness insertion holes 116, 117 are supported by a<br><br>
harness guide member 120 formed of a synthetic resin and fastened to a lower surface of the bottom bridge 73 in the front fork 72. [0068]<br>
Referring to Figs. 17 and 18, the harness guide member 120 includes a first holding plate 120a, a second holding plate 120b, a hinge 120c, a pair of side plates 120d, 120d, and engagement pins 120e, 120e, all integrated therewith.  Specifically, the harnesses 63, 118 .., 119 can be held in position between the first holding plate 120a and the second holding plate 120b.  The hinge 120c connects the first holding plate 120a and the second holding plate 120b. The side plates 120d, 120d are connected to the first holding plate 120a. The engagement pins 120e, 120e protrude sideways from the side plates 120d, 120d. [0069]<br>
The hinge 120c disposed between the first holding plate 120a and the second holding plate 120b is formed by thinning an area between the first holding plate 120a and the second holding plate 120b so that the first holding plate 120a and the second holding plate 120b can be switched between a straight line open position as shown in Figs. 17 and 18 and a folded position, in which the<br><br>
second holding plate 120b is folded over the first holding plate 120a as shown by a chain line in Fig. 18. [0070]<br>
The first holding plate 120a includes a recess 121 formed integrated therewith at a central portion thereof in the longitudinal direction. The harnesses 63, 118 . ., 119 are accommodated in the recess 121. The second holding plate 120b includes a holding portion 122 integrated therewith at a central portion thereof in the longitudinal direction. The holding portion 122, being substantially circular in shape, holds the harnesses 63, 118 .., 119 lengthily along the longitudinal direction thereof. [0071]<br>
The first holding plate 120a includes a rectangular insertion hole 123 formed on the end thereof adjacent to the hinge 120c. The second holding plate 120b includes a rectangular insertion hole 124 formed on the end thereof adjacent to the hinge 120c. The insertion hole 124 is continuous with the insertion hole 123 when the second holding plate 120b is folded over the first holding plate 120a.  In addition, the first holding plate 120a includes a circular insertion hole 125 formed on the end thereof remote from the hinge 120c. The second holding plate 120b<br><br>
includes an oblong insertion hole 126 formed on the end thereof remote from the hinge 120c. The insertion hole 126 is continuous with the insertion hole 125 when the second holding plate 120b is folded over the first holding plate 120a. [0072]<br>
The side plates 120d .. are provided in a connected row arrangement with the first holding plate 120a so as to be fitted between the pair of lower mounting plates 83, 83 protruded downwardly from the stay main portion 76a in the stay 76. The engagement pins 120e .. are passed through and engaged with lock holes 127, 127 formed in the lower mounting plates 83 . . [0073]<br>
The harness guide member 120 is held in position by the stay 76 when the two side plates 120d .. are fitted between the two lower mounting plates 83 .. by letting the engagement pins 12Oe .. pass through and engage the lock holes 127 .. before the second holding plate 120b is folded over the first holding plate 120a. After the harnesses 63, 118 .., 119 are passed through the harness insertion holes 116, 117 in the stay 76, the second holding plate 120b is folded over the first holding plate 120a so that the harnesses 63, 118 .., 119 are sandwiched<br><br>
between the second holding plate 120b and the first holding plate 120a.  In the condition of the second holding plate 12 0b being folded over the side of the first holding plate 120a, bolts 128, 128 are passed through the insertion holes 123, 124 continuous on the end of the first and second holding plates 120a, 120b adjacent to the hinge 120c and the insertion holes 125, 12 6 continuous on the end of the first and second holding plates 120a, 120b remote from the hinge 120c, respectively. The bolts 128 . . are then screwed and tightened into threaded holes 129, 129 formed in the bottom bridge 73.  This results in the harness guide member 12 0, which has been folded down with the harnesses 63, 118 .., 119 held therein being fastened to the bottom bridge 73, [0074]<br>
Effects of the second embodiment of the present invention will be described below. The stay main portion 76a in the stay 76 formed of a synthetic resin has the back plate portion 76aa for substantially covering the headlight 18 from the rearward direction. The harnesses 63, 118 .., 119, the support portion of the meter unit 77, and the headlight 18 can therefore be hidden.  Moreover, the back plate portion 76aa can be easily formed and<br><br>
promote increased stiffness of the stay main portion 76a. Further, the pair of left and right side cover portions 76ab .. included in the stay main portion 76a can cover the inner surfaces on both sides of the front cowl 79 from the inward direction. This eliminates the need for parts dedicated to covering the inner surfaces on both sides of the front cowl 79. Accordingly, a structure having a reduced number of parts used covers the inner surfaces on both sides of the front cowl 79 from the inward direction for the improved appearance. Moreover, the stay 76, formed from a synthetic resin, allows the side cover portions 76ab .. to be easily formed.<br>
[0075]<br>
The headlight 18 disposed forwardly of the stay 76 is swingably supported by the front cowl 79 that covers the headlight 18. The front cowl 79, in turn, is mounted to the stay 76. Accordingly, the stay 76 serves also as a rear cover of the headlight 18. This promotes further reduction in the number of parts used and the number of assembly man-hours required.<br>
[0076]<br>
The front cowl 79 and the stay 76, each being formed to have an outline substantially identical with each other in the front view, are joined together so as<br><br>
to form therebetween the accommodation chamber 114 for accommodating part of the meter unit 77 and the headlight 18.  The meter unit 77 and the headlight 18 can thereby be brought compactly together, while achieving a good appearance.<br>
[0077]<br>
The stay 76 includes the large plurality of air vent holes 115, 115 ..  Running wind entering a space inside the front cowl 79 through a gap between the front cowl 79 and the headlight 18 effectively circulates through the air vent holes 115, 115 .. in the stay 76, so that running resistance by the running wind can be reduced. Moreover, each of the air vent holes 115, 115 .. is disposed in the stay main portion 76a of the stay 76 such that each falls within the area that substantially overlaps the headlight 18 in the front view.  This allows the running wind entering the space inside the front cowl 7 9 through the gap between the front cowl 79 and the headlight 18 to flow through the air vent holes 115, 115 .. more smoothly and easily, so that the running resistance can be reduced more.<br>
[0078]<br>
The stay main portion 76a in the stay 76 also includes the harness insertion holes 116, 117, through<br><br>
which the harnesses 63, 118 . ., 119 can be passed. The<br>
harnesses 63, 118 .., 119 can thereby be hidden behind<br>
the front cowl 79 and the stay 76 and routed collectively.<br>
[0079]<br>
While the present invention has been particularly described with reference to a preferred embodiment, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and detail may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
