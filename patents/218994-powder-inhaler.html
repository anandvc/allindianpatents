				<td>POWDER INHALER<br>
The present invention relates to a powder inhaler, i.e. a device for dispensing a powdered medicament preparation by inhalation. The device is in particular a portable multiple-dose device without propellant gas, equipped with a metering member which dispenses doses from a medicament container. Moreover, the device is based on centripetal force for achieving a more effective pulverization of the powdered inhalation medicament in such a manner that the penetration of the medicament into the lungs of a patient is improved and the adhesion to the upper respiratory passages is reduced for alleviating possible side effects caused thereby.<br>
The administering of a powdered medicament preparation by inhalation from an inhaler is commonly known. Multiple-close type powder inhalers comprising a powder container and a metering member which measures and dispenses a unit dose are also known, for example from patent publications GB 2165159, EP 0 079 478, and EP 0 166 294. In these devices, a series of dosing recesses are notched into the surface of a cylindrical metering member, and the said member is disposed in a chamber of precisely the same shape. When the metering member is rotated, the dosing recesses in turn will move first to a position in alignment with the powder container for being filled and thereafter to a position in alignment with an inhalation channel, whereupon a unit dose will fall by gravity from the dosing recess into the inhalation channel. Thereafter the dose of medication is inhaled from the inhalation channel. These devices have the drawback that they make overdosing of the medicament possible by allowing the dispensing of a plurality of doses in succession into the<br><br>
WO 2004/012801	PCT/EP2003/008432<br>
2<br>
inhalation  channel,   whereby a multiple dose may be drawn by one inhalation.<br>
Inhalation  devices   having  a metering plate movable between a filling and  a  dispensing position  are  described e.g.   in patent publications   WO  92/10229,   US   5,113,855,   US  2,587,215, EP   0   546  996,   WO  94/04210  and US  5,161,524.   A  further  example   of prior  art devices  is  given in WO 93/03782.   However,   these, devices  also  suffer  from a drawback that they make overdosing possible by  allowing  the dispensing of a plurality of doses  into the  inhalation channel.<br>
Attempts have been   made to  solve this problem by using inhalers or  dispensing   systems  in which the  dosing  recess  will  not be emptied into   the  inhalation  channel  by  gravity but,   instead,   the dose   of medication   is   inhaled directly  from the  dosing  recess, such   recesses  having  been  notched  into the  surface of  a  metering member.   The metering member may have  the  shape of  a cylinder,   a cone  or a truncated  cone,   as  disclosed in patent publications<br>
WO  92/00771   and WO   92/09322.   Furthermore,   in these devices,   the<br>
metering member having  the  shape  of  a  cylinder,   a  cone  or a truncated cone is  disposed in a chamber having precisely the same   shape.   When the  metering member   is  rotated,   the  dosing  recesses  will   move  first  to  a position   in  alignment  with  the medicament container   for  filling,   and then to the  inhalation channel  which  is   shaped   so  that  the  respective  dosing  recess  will  be emptied under  the   effect  of  the  air   flow  being  inhaled,   and thereafter,    having   rotated through  a   full   360°,   back to  a position   in alignment   with  the medicament  container.   The  lower  surface  of the   chamber  wall may also have an emptying aperture  from which  any powdered  medicament possibly  left  in  the  dosing  recess will   fall  out  during  the   said rotation.<br><br>
WO 2004/012801	PCT/EP2003/008432<br>
3<br>
In the rotating dispensing devices described above, the distance from the filling position to the inhalation position is less than 90° of a circle arc. Since the metering member is, for purposes of metering precision, disposed within a chamber of the same shape, and since it has to be rotated through 360°, of which at least 270° are useless for the actual function of the inhaler, in these devices particles will inevitably fall onto the slide surface between the metering member and the chamber. Thereby the rotation of the highly sensitive metering member will be disturbed and may even be completely obstructed. The metering member jamming inside the chamber will hinder the functioning of the whole device. Vigorous shaking or tapping will only increase the jamming as more powder flows into the gap between the chamber and the metering member.<br>
An improvement of the powder inhalers of the prior art is suggested in EP 0 758 911. The described powder inhaler comprises a powder container, an air channel through which air is drawn via a mouthpiece, and a metering member equipped with a dosing recess, the metering member being movable in its longitudinal direction between a first position, in which the dosing recess is filled with powder coming from the container, and a second position, in which the filled dosing recess is brought into the air channel, the powder being maintained in the recess by the support of the recess bottom, and the air channel being directed to introduce the air flow into the bottom of the dosing recess during inhalation whereby the powder is released directly from the dosing recess. According to the powder inhaler of this prior art document, the metering member is a metering strip which is disposed on a flat surface and moves along said flat surface. When moving between the filling and the inhalation positions, the metering strip travels over an aperture for remnants, at which time any powder possibly remaining between the metering strip and the flat surface will fall out through the aperture. This<br><br>
WO 2004/012801	PCT/EP2003/008432<br>
4<br>
powder inhaler is still not completely satisfying for the following reasons, e.g. the inhaled air flow is directed longitudinally relative to the metering strip. In this condition both the deaggregation of the powder and the removal of the powdered medicament from the metering strip by the inhaled air flow is not efficient. Moreover, any powder possibly left after the inhalation will remain in the air channel until the metering strip again moves along the flat surface into the air channel during a subsequent inhalation process. This remaining powder could be accidentally inhaled by the patient. Furthermore, the powder remaining inside the air channel may deteriorate due to the friction between the surfaces.<br>
As mentioned above, a further problem with respect to powder inhalers is that a sufficient deaggregation of the powder and the removal of the powdered medicament or drug from the metering member by the inhaled air flow is not satisfactory in the powder inhalers of the prior art.<br>
It is generally known that the size of medicament particles should be 1-5 microns, preferably 2-3 microns, for the best possible penetration into their destination, i.e. deep into the lungs. The most common metering device is a so-called inhalation aerosol which is quite readily capable of reaching the optimal particle size. In addition to inhalation aerosols, an increasing number of powder inhalers are presently in use as these offer certain benefits, e.g. there is no need for ozone-destroying propellants. However, a drawback of powder inhalers is that a powdered medicament issuing from the powder inhaler has a too large particle size. Thus, most of the medicine dosage coming out of inhalers is retained in upper respiratory passages which, with certain medicines, can cause serious side effects. The medicine dosages required for different inhalation medicaments vary considerably, the smallest being approximately 0,01 mg and the largest 20 mg. When small amounts of medicine are metered in<br><br>
WO 2004/012801	PCT/EP2003/008432<br>
5<br>
powdered form, it is generally necessary to use some adjuvant or carrier, so that the sufficiently precise measuring of a dosage would be possible with the present technology. No matter if the dosage comprises just medicine or has a carrier admixed therein, the medicine dosage substantially comprises inter-adhered particles and most of these agglomerates are too large to penetrate into the lungs. As the agglomerates are released in a powder inhaler into an air flow directed into the lungs of a patient, there will occur some dispersal of these particle deposits, said dispersal resulting from the formulation of a powdered medicament and the construction of an inhaler. It is known that constructions creating a strong turbulence are capable of more effective pulverization.<br>
In practice, however, no prior known powder inhalator structure and/or medicine formulation has produced results that would be equal to those achieved by an ordinary inhalation aerosol. it has been suggested as a partial solution that inhalation should be effected with as much force as possible, whereby the turbulence and pulverization of particles would accordingly be most effective. However, a quick inhalation is difficult for a person suffering e.g. from serious asthma and, on the other hand, a quick inhalation increases the residue in upper respiratory tracts. According to studies, pulverization of agglomerates is indeed intensified but the overall benefit is marginal. Excellent Pulmonary penetration in relation to the adherence of medicament to the upper respiratory tracts has been achieved by slow inhalation, corresponding to a flow rate of approximately 30 1/min or 0.5 1/sec.<br>
Finnish patent application No. 871000 (corresponding to Indian Patent No.IN 168166) discloses a powder inhalator which has been designed in an effort to produce a clearly defined turbulence for pulverizing agglomerations of medicine. The centrally directed deflectors inside the device or the helical chute are explained to set the air flow in a spinning mo-<br><br>
WO 2004/012801	PCT/EP2003/008432<br>
6<br>
tion,  whereby the medicine particles  entrapped in the  air abrade as   a  result  of  centrifugal  force against  the wails of the structure  as well  as   collide with each other with resulting pulverization. The  device described in the  cited application has been marketed under  the tradename Turbohaler(r)   (Draco,   Sweden),  and the   pulverizing  structure therein is,   as  described above,  a helical chute  or  groove.   Laboratory tests  indicated  that this device had.   a   relatively good pulverization  of  agglomerates   of medicine which,   however,   could still be  improved and  intensified.   In view of  the  pulverization of agglomerates  or accumulations of medicine,   there are a few defects  in this  device.   The helical groove  has   in the  centre thereof  an  open  space having less   air  resistance  than  inside the  groove.   Accordingly,  the flow  rate   of air  and centrifugal force  on the circumference   of the   groove   are   less  than theoretically possible.   Since the  particles advance   in  the  groove  under  a  force  caused by   air resistance and   centrifugal  force  tends  to push  the  particles perpendicularly   -to  the  circumferential tangent,   the  actual   force   applied to the particles  is  a  resultant  of  these   forces   and is   applied diagonally relative to the circumferential1 tangent.  Tnus, the   centrifugal   force  resulting  from the  spinning motion cannot be   utilized  in  full  extent  for the pulverization of   accumulations.   In   all  deflector  structures  according  to the   cited application,  the particles  escape  from the  device within  a  few thousandths of   a   second when using  conventional   inhalation  rates   of 30-90  1/min,   and  that   is  a very short  time  for  an effective   pulverization.   The  residence time can be prolonged,   e.g.   by increasing  the  number   of  helices  in groove  portions  or   the number of   separate  deflector  structures  or  the  length  of  zigzagging   air flow  channels,   but  this  would complicate manufacturing  and cleaning and medicine  residues in the  actual device  would increase. After  all,   cleaning of the structures  disclosed in  the cited application   is   difficult.<br><br>

EP   O   407   028   shows  in its  Figs.   5 to 7  a vortex chamber into which  an  inlet tangentially directs  air with a pulverized   medicament.   The dispersion  air/medicament  leaves the  chamber  axi-ally  at  an   outlet .   Nothing is  said about  the diameter of  the chamber.<br>
FR-A-2352556   shows  a  cylindrical  vortex  chainber closed at    one end,    operated by   the  action of  inhalation  and having one   tangential   air-medicament inlet duct,   an  additional tangential   air inlet  duct   and an   axial  outlet duct near the  same   end of  the chainber as   the inlet  duct.   The outlet  is  formed by  a tube-like connection  extending beyond the  zone of the  inlet  duct and impeding the   air flow.   Nothing is  said again about  the diameter of the   cylindrical  chamber.<br>
Moreover,   in  the   device described in EP  0  477  222  a powdered medicament   intended   for inhalation  is pulverized on  the basis  of  a sufficiently  powerful  centrifugal   force prior  to  or  during   inhalation.   The  centrifugal  force  is produced by the  action of  inhalation.   A powdered medicament  is  entrapped in a gas  flow  and forced in  a   substantially circular or  rotationally  symmetrical space  to   such  a powerful   rotating motion  that  an  effective splitting   of   accumulations  of medicine  is  obtained.   This   is   effected  in   a   rotationally  symmetrical  chamber whose   largest   internal  diameter  can be  20  mm.   The  optimum diameter   of the   vortex chamber  operating   by  the   action  of   inhalation  is   10-20 mm.    If the   diameter   is  increased,   the  pulverization  effect   deteriorates 'in  a   manner  that,    with  a  diameter  of more  than 30  mm,   the   pulverization   effect    is  no  longer  significant.<br>
From.   EP   0   8 65   302,    a   further powder  inhaler  is  known which,   com-  , prises  a  medicament  container  for  storing a dry powdered medicament ,   a mouthpiece being  covered by a removable protective   cap, and   a  movable  dosing  slide having  a  dosing  cavity  to be pXaced underneath   a   funnel  outlet  of  the  medicament   container for   fill-<br><br>
WO 2004/012801	PCT/EP2003/008432<br>
8<br>
ing. With opening of the protective cap, the movable dosing slide with the filled dosing cavity is pushed into a shutter, and the dosing cavity is closed thereby. Upon a sufficient suction force generated by an inhalation process, a valve shield pushes away the shutter, and the dosing cavity is released in order to enable inhalation of the medicament powder- Furthermore, means are provided for enabling the return of the dosing slide only after a correctly completed inhalation process. A recording unit records the number of correctly performed inhalations and blocks the powder inhaler after a predetermined number of inhalations. Between the inlet and the outlet of the mouthpiece a labyrinthine atomiser path for powder deagglomeration is provided.<br>
The technical problem underlying the present invention is to eliminate the above drawbacks of hitherto known powder inhalers and to provide a powder inhaler with an improved functionality. In particular, it is an object underlying the present invention to provide a powder inhaler with an improved dosing ability, whereby unintended dosing can be avoided, and to provide a pow-dex inhaler with an optimal pulverization of agglomerates of a medicament to be inhaled, respectively.<br>
This technical problem is solved by a powder inhaler having the features defined in claim 1. Furthermore, a deagglomerator ar-<br>
rangement having the features of claims 59 or 75 is proposed, which may be incorporated into such a powder inhaler without, however, being limited to this preferred use. The dependent claims define preferred and advantageous embodiments of the present invention.<br>
According to the present invention, a powder inhaler is provided comprising a container or a powder reservoir for storing a powdered medicament, a metering member having a dosing recess to be filled with one dose of the powdered medicament, a 	mouthpiece<br><br>
WO 2004/012801	PCT/EP2003/008432<br>
9<br>
being in communication with an inhalation channel, and a protective member being provided between the metering member and the . inhalation channel. The metering member is moveable between a filling position, in which the dosing recess is in alignment with an opening of the container so as to be filled with one dose of the powdered medicament, and an inhalation position, in which the dosing recess is in alignment with the inhalation channel. The protective member is moveable between a closed position, in which it at least covers the dosing recess when the metering member is in the inhalation position, thereby preventing the powdered medicament contained in the dosing recess from entering into the inhalation channel, and an open position, in which the protective member does not cover the dosing recess, thereby exposing the dosing recess to the inhalation channel so as to enable inhalation of the dose of the powdered medicament contained in the dosing recess.<br>
The protective member, which is preferably a thin plate sliding<br>
on the metering member between its closed position and its poen<br>
position, prevents the drug or powdered medicament contained in the dosing recess from falling out of the dosing recess, thereby preventing an unintentional loss of the powdered medicament contained in the dosing recess. Although a manual movement of the protective member between its closed position and its open position is conceivable, the protective member is preferably automatically withdrawn and moved from its closed position into its open position upon an inhalation process, thereby enabling the powdered medicament contained in the dosing recess to be released into the inhalation channel. Thus, the powder inhaler can be used in a variety of orientations, even upside down when the user or patient is lying in a bed, for example. This is a distinctive advantage over prior art products where the dose can be lost by a poor orientation of the device.<br><br>
WO 2004/012801	.	PCT/EP2003/008432<br>
10<br>
In order to automatically withdraw the protective member from its closed position and move it into its open position upon an inhalation process, an inhalation actuated mechanism may be provided being coupled to the protective member such that, if the protective member is in its closed position, the inhalation actuated mechanism moves the protective member into its open position if the inhalation suction force of the respective user exceeds a predetermined value. Preferably, the inhalation or breath actuated mechanism is constructed such that it automatically returns the protective member into its closed position after the respective inhalation process has properly been completed.<br>
The powder inhaler of the present invention may comprise a casing and an integral cover, the integral cover being rotatably or pivotably coupled to the casing so as to enable opening and closing of the integral cover. The casing may comprise a window or an opening for displaying the number of doses taken or the number of doses left in the container, this number being counted by a dose counting unit. If the cover is closed it covers the mouthpiece being located at the upper  side of the casing. The casing may also comprise an opening for a mark, for example in the form of a flap, which shows if a dose is ready for inhalation or not. In particular, this flap may disappear upon completion of an inhalation process, thereby showing that the respective dose has been taken by the user.<br>
The container storing the powdered medicament is preferably divided up into a medicament chamber storing the powdered medicament and a desiccant chamber for storing a desiccant provided for drying out the powdered medicament contained in the medicament chamber, the desiccant chainber being separated from the medicament chainber by a separate permeable membrane. The permeability of the membrane is different from, in particular greater than that between either the desiccant or the medicament and the<br><br>
WO 2004/012801	PCT/EP2003/008432<br>
11<br>
outside world. This can be achieved, for example, by making the membrane from a different material and/or a thinner material than the main body of the container. Both the medicament chamber and the desiccant chamber may be sealed by foils. The bottom of the medicament chamber may have a dosing opening so that the powdered medicament contained therein can be filled into the dosing recess of the metering member supported by gravity, if the metering member is in its filling position. The filling process is furthermore supported by an appropriate shape of the medicament chamber which should have a cross-section diameter gradually decreasing from its top to its bottom, thereby forming a funnel for the powdered medicament.<br>
The metering member is preferably a slide or a shuttle which is provided within the casing slidingly moveable in the horizontal direction between the filling position and the inhalation position. In the filling position the dosing recess faces the dosing opening of the container, and in the inhalation position the dosing recess faces an inhalation opening of the inhalation channel being in communication with the mouthpiece. The slide is preferably coupled to the cover such that opening of the cover causes the slide to move from the filling position forward to the inhalation position, and closing of the cover causes the slide to move from the inhalation position backward to the filling position. Projections, for example in the form of bolts, may be formed at both longitudinal sides of the slide, these projections engaging with profiled cam tracks being formed at the respective sides of the cover. This allows that the fundamental operating sequence of the powder inhaler is just to open the cover, inhale the dose, and close the cover. It is the simplest possible operating sequence to reduce training time on the one hand and maximize patient compliance on the other hand.<br>
The coupling between the cover and the metering member is preferably such that opening of the cover by a predetermined first<br><br>
WO 2004/012801	PCT/EP2003/008432<br>
12<br>
angle from its closed position, preferably by an angle up to about 30°, does not actuate the metering member at all. Within this range of movement of the cover is slack where no mechanism is driven.. Furthermore, the coupling between the cover and the metering member is preferably such that the metering member is moved in its inhalation position already a predetermined second angle prior to the cover being fully open. For example, the metering member may be placed in its inhalation position already when the cover has been opened by about 90° from its closed position. Between an opening angle of about 90°-135°, for example, there is free play again. This ensures that, should the user attempt a discrete operation of the device, the drug or the powdered medicament is ready already prior to the mouthpiece becoming exposed to the user.<br>
The dosing recess may be designed to maximize the accuracy of gravitationally filling the dosing recess with the powdered medicament and also to maximize the ease of airborne entrainment of the formulation upon inhalation. Therefore, the dosing recess may be a dosing cup which is circular in profile and has an elliptical cross-section, the diameter being preferably three times the depth thereof. This enables the inhalation airflow to scour the dosing cup effectively. The circular profile and the ratio of depth to top area also combines the lowest variability of filling {primarily associated with deep, narrow receptacles) and scraping upon leaving the container (primarily associated with shallow, wide receptacles] .<br>
The flat surface of the metering member may be provided with a slot so that, upon a backward movement of the metering member from its inhalation position to its filling position, any powdered medicament possibly left on the flat surface of the metering member outside the dosing recess is wasted through the slot and can fall into a waste bin being provided underneath the metering member so as to catch this resilient powdered medicament<br><br>
WO 2004/032801	PCT/EP2003/008432<br>
13<br>
In  this way,   even when the dose was not  completely inhaled by the  user,   there   is  no  remaining medicament   in the   inhalation channel.<br>
The  inhalation  actuated mechanism may comprise an  inhalation actuated means/member,   a  resilient  means/member,   and a coupling means/member.   The  resilient member,   which   is  preferably    a spring,   has  a   first   end  which  holds  the  inhalation  actuated member   in  a  first  position.   In  this   condition,   the   aforesaid mark, which  is preferably a  flag,   is visible through the respective opening of  the  casing,   thereby  indicating  that  a   dose has   not been   taken  and  is  ready  for  inhalation,   respectively.  The   inhalation  actuated member   is preferably a  flap.   Upon   forward movement   of the  metering  member  from its  filling position to   its  inhalation position,   the resilient member is  charged up or   ten-sioned,   thereby  releasing the  inhalation  actuated member .   The inhalation  actuated member  is  arranged  and   constructed  such that,    in  this   condition,   only a predetermined inhalation   suction force   of an  user,   however not blowing,   can move  the inhalation actuated member  out   from its  first  position  into   a  second  position.   For  example,   in this  case,   the  inhalation   actuated   member may  pivot  or  rotate  from its  first  position  into   its second position.   Thereby,   the  mark of  the   inhalation  actuated member  disappears  and  is  no  longer  visible  through  the  respective   opening in   the  casing,   indicating to  the  user  that  a dose  has been  taken and,   thus,   currently  no  dose  is  ready  for  inhalation.  The   inhalation  actuated member,   the  resilient member,   and  the coupling member  are   also  arranged and  constructed  such that  the  inhalation   actuated member  holds  the  coupling member,   which is   preferably  in the  form  of  a  yoke,   in  a   first position.   The  coupling member  is  coupled to the protective member,   and preferably also to   the  metering member.<br>
When  the  inhalation  actuated member  is moved  from  its fixst  position  to its  second position by a  sufficient inhalation   force<br><br>
WO 2004/012801	PCT/EP2003/008432<br>
14<br>
effected by   a user,   the coupling member  is  released and,   by the discharging   effect  of the  resilient member,   automatically moved into   its second position in which the coupling member automatically  moves   the  protective member  from its  closed position  into its   open position,   thereby  releasing the  dose  contained   in  the dosing  recess.   For  example,   the coupling member  may have   an  arm which   is released  upon movement  of  the  inhalation  actuated member  from its   first  position into  its  second position,   and the coupling member may also comprise  a prolonged projection which, on the one hand,   engages an opening of  the protective member and,   on the   other hand,   is  slidingly moveable within a   slid formed  in the  metering member.<br>
When   the cover  of  the  powder  inhaler  is  closed  again,   the  metering member  is  returned to  its  filling position,   and the    aforesaid   dose counting  unit  is  actuated  and  incremented.   In   particular,   this  is   effected  as  follows:<br>
The   coupling  member may comprise  a  further  prolongation,   preferably  in the   form  of   a  cantilever,   which,   when  the metering member  causes  the   coupling member  to move back  from its    second position to    its   first  position,   actuates  the dose   counting  unit. In this regard,   the  dose  counting  unit  may  comprise  a wheel  arrangement having  a  plurality of wheels  being numbered on  one side   facing   the  opening of the casing of the powder inhaler and being   coupled  to  each  other by a  gear  arrangement.   In particular,   the wheel   arrangement may comprise  a plurality of   wheels for   displaying  the  numbers   for  a  different   order   of magnitude, respectively.   For   example,   the wheel  arrangement  may comprise  a units   wheel    and  a  tens  wheel  being  coupled by  an  idler   wheel.   On the   other  side   of  at   least  one wheel  there  may be   arranged  a plurality of   drive teeth being arranged along the  circumferential   direction   of  the   respective wheel.   The  above  prolongation of  the  coupling  member  is moved over  one  of  these  drive    teeth when  the coupling member  is moved  from  its   first  position  to  its<br><br>
WO 2004/012801	PCT/EP2003/008432<br>
15<br>
second position, thereby bringing the prolongation of the coupling member into engagement with the respective drive tooth. On the other hand/ when the metering member is moved backward into its filling position (and the resilient member is thus allowed to discharge) , the movement of the coupling member from its second position to its first position caused thereby results in the prolongation of the coupling member rotating the respective wheel by one step, thereby decrementing (or alternatively) the dose counting unit. At the same time, the coupling member also moves the protective member back into its closed position, and the resilient member returns the inhalation actuated member to its first position and holds it in this position, so that the mark attached to the inhalation actuated member is visible through the respective opening of the casing again. Furthermore by these movements the coupling member is again brought into engagement with the inhalation actuated member, and in particular in this condition the aforesaid arm of the coupling member is held by the inhalation actuated member again. Thereby, the initial condition of the inhalation actuated mechanism and of the device is resumed again, and the above described operation of the powder inhaler can be repeated.<br>
The above mark or flag has a very useful function. It shows a user if he has already taken a dose, thereby removing the possibility of double closing. Furthermore, only inhaled doses are displayed by the dose counting unit. This reduces wastage and gives the user a true indication of what has been inhaled. The above described dose counting unit is directly driven by a closing operation of the cover. This is more reliable than using a stored energy. However, the driving of the dose counting unit may well be assisted by the stored energy of the resilient member.<br>
The inhalation channel through which air is inhaled in use is preferably designed to comprise a deagglomerator arrangement<br><br>
WO 2004/012801	PCT/EP2003/008432<br>
16<br>
comprising a  substantially tangential  air inlet,   a preferably rotationally   symmetrical  vortex chamber,   and an  air  outlet which is   axially aligned with the vortex chamber such, that  airflow within the vortex  chamber   leads  to  a  strong velocity  gradient. The  vortex  chamber has  a  diameter  d of   6mm ( d (   10mm,   preferably   6mm (  d (   8mm,   in particular  about   8  mm,   since   such  a  diameter  dimension has proven to be most effective  for  the  deagglom-eration  function.   The  air  outlet  of  the   deagglomerator  arrangement  has preferably  a  smaller  diameter   than the  vortex  chamber. The base section of the vortex chamber may have  a  substantially elliptical  cross-section,   while the  air   outlet     (and the  inhalation   channel)   is  preferably  circular  in   cross-section.   In  addition  or alternatively,   the  outer walls   of  the  vortex  chamber have   the shape  of  arcs  which are non-concentric   to  the   inner  diameter  of the  vortex  chamber  so as  to  achieve   an  improved deagglomerator  functionality.<br>
Besides the  above  described  features of  the powder  inhaler  of the  present  invention,   a  couple  of  variants could be  incorporated  into  the powder  inhaler  as  well.   For  example,   a  manual override mechanism could be  incorporated  into  the   inhalation  actuated mechanism for manually moving the  protective member  and manually actuating  the  inhalation  actuated mechanism.   This  would allow  users  who  could not   generate  the   required,   flow  rate  for actuating the  inhalation  actuated mechanism to   manually release the  dose contained  in  the  dosing  recess   and trigger  the  dose counting unit.   Furthermore,   an extra part  could  be   added to override the   inhalation  actuated dose   counting   unit.   This would especially be  of benefit  to  those  people  who cannot   achieve  the required flow  rate to operate the  inhalation actuated mechanism. Furthermore,   a one-way valve could be placed in   the  inhalation channel,   preferably  over  the  inlet  to  the deagglomerator  arrangement   (cyclone) .   This   could  reduce  any moisture  blown  into the   inhaler by  about   50  %.<br><br>
WO 2004/012801	PCT/EP2003/008432<br>
17<br>
Furthermore, another means of delivering a dose upon inhalation could be incorporated. Such a means could comprise a resilient member, in particular in the form of a spring, which is compressed by means of opening the cover. The resilient member would act on the metering member. The metering member would be free to move to a half-way position between the container and the inhalation channel. However, the metering member would be held at this half-way position until an inhalation actuated mechanism releases the metering member to complete its travel to the inhalation channel and, hence, present the dose contained in the dosing recess for inhalation. The half-way position (mid-point position) would have the combined effect of retaining the dose in the dosing recess and protecting it from moisture from user exhalation or discharge.-<br>
The device of the present invention delivers consistent respi-rable dose values to the patient across a wide range of pressure drops. For example, between 30 1/min and 90 1/min the fine particle fraction, a measure of Pulmonary penetration varies by less than 20%. Furthermore, this performance only requires a low work input from the patient with the device being classified as a low to medium resistance device.<br><br>

Accordingly, the present invention provides a powder inhaler, comprising: a container for storing a powdered medicament, a metering member having a dosing recess, the metering member being moveable between a filling position, in which the dosing recess is in alignment with an opening of the container so as to be filled with a dose of the powdered medicament, and an inhalation position, in which the dosing recess is in alignment with an inhalation channel, and a mouthpiece being in communication with the inhalation channel for enabling inhalation of the dose of the powdered medicament contained in the dosing recess of the metering member when the metering member is in the inhalation position, characterized in that a protective member is provided between the metering member and the inhalation channel, the protective member being moveable between a closed position, in which the protective member at least covers the dosing recess of the metering member when the metering member is in the inhalation position, thereby preventing the powdered medicament contained in the dosing recess from entering into the inhalation channel and an open position, in which the protective member does not cover the dosing recess, thereby exposing the dosing recess to the inhalation channel so as to enable inhalation of the dose of the powdered medicament contained in the dosing recess.<br>

Figures 28A, 28B and 28C show a perspective view, a bottom view and a top view, respectively, of a dosing sub-assembly of a powder inhaler according to a further embodiment of the invention.<br>
The powder inhaler shown in Figure 1 comprises a casing with a lower shell 1 and an integral cover 2 being pivotably or rotata-bly coupled to the lower shell 1. In a side surface of the lower shell 1 a window 4 is formed for displaying numbers of a dose counting unit which will be described later.<br>
As can be taken from Figure 2, the integral cover 2 can be opened to reveal a mouthpiece 3 with which a user can inhale a powdered medicament. At the upper front side of the mouthpiece 3 slots 6 are formed which allow air inlet. Furthermore, at the upper side of the mouthpiece 3 an opening or a hole 5 is formed which allows to view a visible mark or flag showing if a dose is ready. As will be described later, this flag disappears upon inhalation showing that the respective dose has been taken.<br>
The structure of the lower shell 1, the integral cover 2 and the mouthpiece 3 can also be taken from Figure 3 which shows a top view of the powder inhaler. In Figure 3 (and in Figure 8), the integral cover 2 is shown without side labels which are depicted in Figures 1 and 2. These side labels prevent access to profiled cam tracks being described later so as to protect these cam tracks from dust etc.<br>
Figure 14, Figure 15, and Figure 16 show perspective views of the integral cover 2, the lower shell 1, and the mouthpiece 3, respectively. The lower shell 1 and the mouthpiece 3 are constructed such that the mouthpiece 3 can be snap-fitted onto the lower shell 1 . From both side surfaces of the lower shell 1 projections or bolts extend which engage with respective central openings at both side surfaces of the integral cover 2, thereby allowing rotational movement of the integral cover 2 relative to the lower shell 1. As can be seen from Figure 1 and Figure 2,<br><br>
WO 2004/012801	PCT/EP2 003/00843 2<br>
21<br>
the integral cover 2 is closed when its lower surface rests on the upper rim of the lower shell 1, and the integral cover 2 can be opened until its rear edge abuts against the underside of the lower shell 1 (see Figure 2) . At both side surfaces of the integral cover 2, openings 31 having the shape of profiled cam tracks are formed which are coupled to side projections 28 of a shuttle or slide 15, a perspective view thereof being shown in Figure 13. This kind of coupling between the integral cover 2 and the slide 15 will be described later in detail.<br>
Within the casing and the lower shell 1, respectively, there are two sub-assemblies arranged. The first sub-assembly is a dosing sub-assembly 13 which in particular meters a powdered medicament , while the second sub-assembly is a dose counting sub-assembly 14 which comprises an inhalation actuated mechanism and a dose counting unit for counting the number of doses taken by the user.<br>
Figure 4 shows a perspective view of the dosing sub-assembly 13. As can be seen, the dosing sub-assembly 13 comprises a container or a reservoir 7 -for storing a powdered medicament, the above-mentioned slide 15 shown in Figure 13, and a deagglomerator arrangement 16 to be coupled to an inhalation channel of the mouthpiece 3. A spring 17 is clamped onto side projections of the dosing sub-assembly 13 such that it holds the dosing sub-assembly together.<br>
Figure 18 shows a perspective view of the spring 17. As can be easily seen, the spring 17 comprises four resilient side spring members, two spring members being fixed to the rear side and two spring members being fixed to the front side of the spring 17. All four spring members extend in the longitudinal direction of the spring 17 such that their free ends are arranged in a middle portion of the spring 17. These spring members apply a force to the slide 15 such that the slide 15 is continuously urged<br><br>
WO 2004/012801	PCT/EP2003/008432<br>
22<br>
against the   underside  of the dosing  sub-assembly 13.   From the rear   side to   the   front   side  of  the  spring   17,   there  extends  an additional  resilient   spring  member which applies  a  separate force   to the    longitudinal middle  region of   the   slide  15.   As  is shown   in Figure   13,   in  this   longitudinal middle  region  the  slide 15 has   a dosing   recess   18   in  the  form  of a   dosing  cup  for metering a   dose of  the powdered medicament  and for  transporting the dose   from a   filling  position  underneath the   container  7   to  an inhalation position  underneath  the  deagglomerator  arrangement 16.   The  above-mentioned  separate  spring member  extending  along the  longitudinal  middle  region  of the   spring  17   ensures  that  the dosing   recess   18   is   reliably  pressed   against  the underside  of the dosing sub-assembly 13 if the slide 15   is  in its  inhalation position so   that  the   dosing  recess  18   is properly  located under the  deagglomerator  arrangement  16.<br>
As  already indicated  above,   the  slide   15 serves   as  a metering member   which    can  be moved  in  the horizontal   direction   from a filling position  shown  in  Figure  6A to  an  inhalation position shown   in Figure   6B.   Thus,   the  slide  15   is  slidingly moveable between  the filling position,   where the  dosing  recess  18  is  located   underneath  a  dosing  opening of  the container  7  and  faces the  dosing opening,   and  the   inhalation  position,   where  the dosing  recess  18   is  located underneath  and faces   an  inhalation opening of trie  deagglomerator  arrangement  16  which  is   in  communication with   an  inhalation  channel    (to be   described later)   of the mouthpiece   3.<br>
As  is   shown   in  Figure   6A,   the  container 7   is   a   container  with integral desiccant.   The container 7   comprises  a medicament chamber  8   storing   a  powdered medicament   and a  desiccant  chamber  9 storing a desiccant  for absorbing moisture   that may have  entered the medicament   chamber  8.   The  desiccant chamber   9   is   separated from the medicament  chamber   8  by a  separate   permeable membrane 10.   This permeable  membrane   10   is of   a  different  permeability<br><br>
WO 2004/012801	PCT/EP2003/0084J2<br>
23<br>
than the permeability between either the desiccant or the medicament to the outside world. The permeability of the membrane 10 can be achieved, for example, by making it of a different material and/or a thinner section than the main body of the container 7. Foils 11, 12 are used to seal both the medicament chamber 8 and the desiccant chamber 9. As a matter of course, other suitable sealing means may be used for sealing both chambers 8, 9 as well.<br>
The above described integral desiccant system has the following advantages. The desiccant has only to dry out the medicament chamber rather than the whole device. This requires less desiccant reducing product size and cost. Furthermore, the desiccant is always sealed. This means that the desiccant will still be effective even i f the cover is left open. The desiccant is stored in the separate sealed desiccant chamber 9. This reduces the risk of incorrect assembly if the desiccant used the same closure as the medicament. Moreover, the integral container 7 comprising both the medicament chamber 8 and the desiccant chamber 9 can be manufactured using a 2-shot moulding. This ensures a good seal between the medicament chamber 8 and the desiccant chamber 9 at low product cost. Finally, the foil sealing provides a tamper-proof means of filling the device with the medicament or drug which has a very low permeability and requires only little product space.<br>
As is shown in Figure 6A and Figure 6B, the medicament chamber 8 has a gradually decreasing cross-section diameter from its top to its bottom so that the medicament chamber 8 is shaped like a funnel supporting an easier filling of the dosing recess 18 through the dosing opening formed in the bottom of the medicament chamber 8.<br>
The powder inhaler shown in the drawings solves many technical problems that may occur throughout the life cycle of the powder<br><br>
WO 2004/012801	PCT/EP2003/008432<br>
24<br>
inhaler. The fundamental operating sequence of the powder inhaler is to open the integral cover 2, inhale the dose of the powdered   medicament,   and close the integral  cover 2.<br>
The  cover  2  is  gripped by the user and opened.   As  already   described  above,   the projections  28  formed at both longitudinal sides of    the   slide  15   (see  Figure  13)   engage  with  the  respective side openings   31  formed at both sides  of the  cover  2.   In particular,    these   side  openings   31  are profiled  cam tracks.   The coupling   between the profiled cam tracks  31  and the projections 28   is such  that  opening  of  the  cover  2   causes  the  slide 15   to move forward  from  its   filling  position   (Figure   6A)   to  its   inhalation position   (Figure 6B) .  Likewise,   closing of the cover  2 causes the   slide  to move  from  its  inhalation  position backward to   its  filling  position again.   That  is  to  say,   by  opening/closing  the  cover  2,   the  slide  15   is moved  substantially linearly   with  respect  to  the  casing.   In particular,   the profiled cam tracks   31   are   shaped  such  that  opening  of  the   cover 2   by  a predetermined  first  angle,   for  example,   by  an  angle   of about 30°,   from  its   closed position  does  not  actuate  the   slide  15. That is   the  first  30°   of the movement  of the  cover 2  is slack where no   mechanism is  driven.   The  industrial  design  of the   powder  inhaler   is   intended to  convey the  correct  orientation   of use.   Furthermore,   the  coupling between  the  cover  2   and the    slide 15   is such  that  the  slide  15  is properly moved  to  its  inhalation position   already a predetermined second angle,   prior to the cover 2  being  fully opened.   For example,   the  slide  15 may be moved to   its  inhalation position already when the  cover 2   has been opened by   90°.   In  a  range  of  90°-135°,   e.g.,   there  is    again free play.   Therefore,   the  dose  of  the  powdered medicament   filled in  the dosing  recess  18  is correctly presented to the deagglom-erator axrangement  16  as well  as  the  respective  inhalation   channel coupled thereto,   ready for inhaling,   90°-45°  prior to  the cover 2   toeing   fully  open   (An  opening  angle  of   180°   is  considered<br><br>
WO 2004/012801	PCT/EP2003/008432<br>
25<br>
as  representing  a  fully  open position  of   the  cover) .   This   ensures   that   the  dose  will  be   ready   prior  to  the  mouthpiece   3   becoming  exposed  to  the  user   if  the   user  should  attempt  a  discrete operation  of   the  powder   inhaler, . for  example.   There  is  an   audible   click  indicating  that  the cover  2   is   fully  open.<br>
When   the  cover   2   is   closed,   there    are  for  example   45°   of  free play   before   a   further  closing of   the  cover   2 moves  the   slide   15 from   the  inhalation  position to the  filling  position.   Before  the cover   2   is   completely  closed,   there may be   15°   of   free  play,   for example.   It   should  be  noted  that   the  profiled  cam tracks   31 shown  in  the   drawings   are   only exemplary.<br>
As already mentioned  before,   the   dosing  recess  18  has  the   shape of a   dosing   cup  which  is   designed   to maximize  the  accuracy   of gravitationally  filling  the  dosing  cup  and maximize  the  ease  of airborne  entrainment   of  the   formulation  upon  inhalation.   The dosing  cup  is   circular  in  profile    (in top  view)   with an  semi-elliptical  cross-section   (i.e.  the  cross-section  has  the  shape of the  half  of  an  ellipse) ,   the diameter  being  three  times   the depth.   This   enables  the  cyclonic   airflow  in  the  airway  of  the deagglomerator  arrangement   16 to   scour  the  dosing  cup  18  effectively.   The   circular  profile and   the  above-mentioned ratio   of depth  to  top   area  also  combines the  lowest  variability  of   filling   and  scraping  upon  leaving the    container  7.<br>
During  opening  the   slide  15  is moved  from the  filling position to the  inhalation  position  as well   as  after  the   slide  15 has reached  its   inhalation position,    the  dose  of  the  powdered medicament  filled  in  the  dosing recess   18   of  the   slide  15  is   prevented  from  falling  out  by  a protective member,   i.e.   a  dose  protector   19.   The  dose  protector 19   is  arranged  slidingly moveable on the   slide   15  between  a  closed   position  and  an  open position. In its  closed position,   the dose   protector  19  at  least  completely  covers  the  dosing  recess    18  when  the  slide  15  is  in   the<br><br>
WO 2004/012801	PCT/EP2003/008432<br>
26<br>
inhalation   position,   while   in  its  open  position   the  dose  protector   19 exposes  the  dosing  recess  18  to  the deagglomerator arrangement   3.6   and  the   inhalation  channel  when the  slide  15   is  in its   inhalation position.   The dose protector 19   is  held in  its closed position  by  an  inhalation  or breath actuated mechanism which  will   be  described  later.   This  inhalation   actuated mechanism  is constructed  such that  the  dose  protector  19   is  moved from  its  closed  position to  its  open position only  if  the  inhalation suction   force   effected by  the user  in the   inhalation channel exceeds  a predetermined level.   Furthermore,   the  inhalation  actuated mechanism is  arranged  such  that  only  an  inhalation suction breath  not  a  blowing breath,   can   actuate" the  inhalation actuated mechanism and cause  a movement   from the  dose  protector from  its  closed position to  its  open position.<br>
In  the following,   the  inhalation actuated mechanism in combination  with   the  dose protector  and the dose   counting  unit  is  described in   detail.<br>
Figure 5A   and   Figure   5B  show perspective  views   of  the  dose counting sub-assembly  14   already mentioned above.   The  dose counting sub-assembly  14   consists  of  a   sub-frame  20  which holds a  flap 21   acting  as  an inhalation  actuated member,   a  yoke 22 acting as   a   coupling  member  and a  drive   spring   23   acting  as  a resilient  member.   The  drive  spring  23  drives the  dose  counting unit  which,    in  the present  case,   comprises  an units  wheel  24   and a  tens wheel   26  being  coupled by  an  idler  wheel   25.   Furthermore, the   drive   spring  23  drives  the  dose protector  19.   The  units wheel  24 and the tens wheel  26 display the number  of  doses  remaining in   the  medicament  chamber   8.   As   a matter  of  course,   the drive  spring  23 may be replaced with a  resilient means being constituted by   a  plurality  of  spring elements  ox   spring parts, for   example.<br><br>

In Figure 7A and Figure 7B partial cross-sectional views of the whole powder inhaler along different cross-sectional lines with the cover 2 being dosed are shown. In particular, from Figure 7A it can be seen that the mouthpiece 3 comprises the inhalation channel 27 extending from the upper side of the mouthpiece 3 downward so as to be coupled to the deagglomerator arrangement (cyclone) 16 of the dosing sub-assembly 13.<br>
The functionality of the inhalation actuated mechanism as well as the dosing counting unit is as follows.<br>
As shown in Figure 13, there are formed recesses 30 at both front corner portions of the slide 15. At one of these recesses 30, a prolonged end 34 of the drive spring 23 engages with the slide 15 if the slide 15 is moved forward. By the contact with the slide 15, the drive spring 23 of the inhalation actuated mechanism is tensioned and charged up. A first end 33 of the drive spring 23 rests at a portion 41 of the flap 21 when the drive spring 23 is in its discharged state. Therefore, by charg-ing up the drive spring 23 this reset force exerted by the first end 33 of the drive spring 23 on the flap 21, normally holding the flap 21 in a first horizontal position shown in Figure 9, is released.<br>
Figure 19 shows different perspective views of the flap 21. As can be seen, at the upper surface of the flap 21, a flag 38 is formed which acts as a mark being visible through the opening 5 in the mouthpiece 3 when the flap 21 is in its first horizontal position, whereby indicating that a dose is ready for inhalation. Furthermore, the flap 21 comprises a feature 40 for engagement with an arm 43 of the yoke 22. Finally, the flap 21 also comprises two projections 39 which act as a counterweight. This counterweight balances the flap 21 reducing not only the actuation force required but also the susceptibility of the mechanism to accidental triggering.<br><br>
WO 2004/012801	PCT/EP2003/008432<br>
28<br>
As shown in Figures 9 and 21, the drive spring 23 has a second end 32 which rests on a lateral side surface 48 of the yoke 22.<br>
Figure 25 shows a perspective view and a side view of the yoke 22. The yoke 22 has a shaft-like portion 42 on which the drive spring 23 is mounted. Furthermore, in Figure 25 the arm 4 3 is depicted whose upper end 44 is retained and released, respectively, by the flap 21. At that lateral side of the yoke 22 which is opposite to the lateral side surface 48 on which the second end 32 of the drive spring 23 rests, there is formed a projection 45 having a thickening 46 at its end for operating the dose counting unit which will be described later. From the bottom of the yoke 22, there extents a prolongation 47 which engages, on the one hand, with an opening formed in the dose protector- 19 and, on the other hand, with a slit 29 formed in the front end portion of the slide 15 (see Figure 13 and Figure 20) <br>
As already described above, when the drive spring 23 is decompressed and discharged, its end 33 exerts a reset force on. the portion 41 of the flap 21, thereby holding the flap 21 in its first horizontal position, as shown in Figure 9. In this condition, the dosing protector 19 prevents the powdered medicament contained in the dosing recess 18 from being displaced from the deagglomerator arrangement 16 (cyclone) if the user blows into the mouthpiece 3. Furthermore, the flap 21 provides a resistance if the user blows into the device giving positive feedback.<br>
If, however, the slide 15 is pushed forward by opening the cover 2, thereby compressing and charging the drive spring 23, the reset force exerted by the end 33 of the drive spring on the flap 21 is released, and the flap 21 can be rotated from its first horizontal position shown in Figure 9 into a second position being pivoted relative to the first position if there is a suffi-. cient high inhalation suction force effected by the user in the inhalation channel 27 of the powder inhaler.<br><br>
WO 2004/012801	PCT/EP2003/008432<br>
29<br>
In the latter case, the flap 21 is moved by this sufficient high inhalation force from its first position shown in Figure 9 into its second position shown ±n Figure 10. As can be also seen from Figure 10, by this movement of the flap 21 the arm 43 of the yoke 22 is released. This enables the drive spring 23, due to its compression, to move its second end 32, which is in engagement with the lateral side surface 48 of the yoke 22, and thus the yoke 22 slightly upward. By this rotational upward movement of the yoke 22 the prolongation 47 extending from the upper side of the yoke 22 is moved forward, thereby moving the dose protector 19 from its closed position to its open position. This situation is shown in Figure 10 as well as in Figure 11.<br>
In Figure 20, a perspective view of the dose protector 19 is shown. In particular, in Figure 20 the opening 36 is shown which is in engagement with the prolongation 47 extending downwardly from the bottom of the yoke 22. The front end 35 of the dose protector 19 has a partial circular or semicircular shape so that it can form part of the wall of the deagglomerator arrangement or cyclone 16 when the dose protector 19 is in its closed position.<br>
Since the dose protector 19 has been moved out from its closed position into its open position by the yoke 22, the dosing recess 18 of the slide 15 is exposed to the inside 50 of the cyclone, and the dose of the powdered medicament contained in the dosing recess 18 can be inhaled through the cyclone and the inhalation channel 27 as well as the mouthpiece 3. In the cyclone, the drug or the powdered medicament is entrained into a swirling airflow where the active part of the formulation is disaggregated from the carrier (see reference sign 49) .<br>
Furthermore, since the flap 21 has been moved from its first horizontal position (see Figure 9) to its second position rotated or pivoted relative to its first position (see Figures 10<br><br>
WO 2004/012801	PCT/EP2003/008432<br>
30<br>
and 11) ,.   the  flag  38   formed at the   upper  surface  of the  flap 21 is no longer visible  through the opening  5  in the upper  side of the mouthpiece   3.   That  is  the  flag   38  has disappeared thereby indicating  that   a  dose  has  been taken,   and a new  dose   is  not ready  for   inhalation  again,   yet.<br>
Figure   17   shows  a top view  of the   dosing  sub-assembly,   depicting the inside   50   of  the   cyclone   as well  as  portions   51   (corresponding to    side  walls  78   depicted  in  Figure  26)   which  allow  the mouthpiece  to  be  assembled,   portions  52  which produce   a  cyclonic airflow   within  the  cyclone,   and projections   53   for mounting the dosing    sub-assembly  within  the lower   shell  1  of  the powder  inhaler.    Furthermore,   in Figure 17  there  is also depicted the end stop 37   for  the prolongation  47 of  the yoke  22  and the  dose protector   19,   respectively.<br>
In the    following,   the   functionality  of  the  dose  counting  unit  is explained  in  detail.   A.s  already mentioned above,   the  dose  counting unit,   being provided for counting the number of doses taken (up counter)   or,   alternatively,  the number of doses remaining in the container    (down  counter) ,   comprises  the  units  wheel   24   and the tens  wheel   26  being  coupled to   one  another  by the   idler wheel   2 5.<br>
Figure    22   shows  a   front view,   a perspective  view,   and  a  rear view of   the  units  wheel  24.   The units  wheel  24   comprises  a  central opening   5 4   at  which  it   is  rotatably mounted  at the  dose counting  sub-assembly 14  inside the  casing of the powder inhaler as  shown  in  Figures   5A  and  5B,   for:   example.   Reference  sign  55 designates  a  feature which provides  a thrust-bearing surface with the   lower   shell   1.   Reference    sign   56  designates  numbers which  are printed on  the  outer surface  of the units wheel  24 along  the  circumferential  direction thereof  and with equal  intervals   therebetween.   At the outer periphery of the units wheel 24,  there are   formed teeth  57  for   driving the  idler wheel' 25.  As<br><br>
WO 2004/012801	PCT/EP2003/008432<br>
31<br>
can be taken from the rear view of the units wheel 24, these teeth 57 are formed diametrically opposed to each other. Finally, on the back of the units wheel 24 there are drive teeth 58 which are brought into engagement with the projection or cantilever 45 of the yoke 22 so as to drive the units wheel 24 step by step upon completion of an inhalation process. As can be easily seen from Figure 22, the drive teeth 58 each are inclined in the circumferential direction of the units wheel 24. For example, the diameter 59 of the units wheel 24 may be about 20 mm.<br>
Figure 23 shows a rear view, a perspective view and a front view of the tens wheel 26. On the back of the tens wheel 26, there is formed a plurality of teeth 62 in the circumferential direction of the tens wheel 26. These teeth 62 are driven by the idler wheel 25. Reference numeral 60 designates missing teeth which prevent a drive of the tens wheel 2 6 when the medicament chamber 8 is empty, that is the tens wheel 26 is constructed such that during one life cycle of the powder inhaler nearly one complete rotation of the tens wheel 26 is effected by the dose counting unit. Reference numeral 61 designates an end stop with the casing of the powder inhaler. The diameter 63 of the tens wheel 26, for example, may. be about 25 mm. Reference numeral 64 designates an opening at which the tens wheel 2 6 is rotatably mounted at the dose counting sub-assembly 14f as shown in Figures 5A and 5B, for example. Reference numeral 65 designates a feature which provides a thrust-bearing surface with the casing of the powder inhaler. Furthermore, reference numeral 66 designates a feature which provides a thrust-bearing surface with the lower shell 1, and reference numeral 67 designates the periphery of the opening 64 which is located on the casing of the powder inhaler. On the outer surface of the tens wheel 26, there are formed two circumferential rows of numbers 68. These two rows of numbers display tens and hundreds numbers in correct orientation. In each case,<br><br>
WO 2004/012801	PCT/EP2003/008432<br>
32<br>
a combination of a units number of the units wheel 24 with a tens number and a hundreds number of the tens wheel 2 6 is visible through the opening 4 formed in the lower shell 1 of the powder inhaler (see Figure 1, for example). Each such combination of horizontally adjacent numbers of the units wheel 24 and the tens wheel 26 designates a corresponding number of doses remaining in the medicament chamber 8. Finally, at the outer periphery of the tens wheel 26, there is also formed a projection 69. Along the radial direction of this projection 69, there are no tens and hundreds numbers formed on the outer surface of the tens wheel 26, and this projection 69 covers the units wheel 24 if the medicament chamber 8 is empty such that no numbers are visible through the opening 4 of the lower shell 1, thereby indicating to the user that there is no dose remaining in the medicament chamber any more.<br>
Figure 24 shows a perspective view of the idler wheel 25. The idler wheel 25 has a shaft 72 at which it is rotatably mounted on the sub-frame 20 of the dose counting sub-assembly 14 as shown in Figures 5A and 5B, for example. Furthermore, the idler wheel 25 has half-width teeth 70 which engage with the drive teeth 57 on the back of the units wheel 24. Furthermore, the idler wheel 25 comprises full width teeth 71 which lock against the units wheel 24. When the units wheel 24 is set to numbers "1"-"9" (reference numeral 56 in Figure 22), the teeth 57 on the back of the units wheel 24 fit between the full-width teeth 71 of the idler wheel 25. When the units wheel 24 is set to number "0", however, the teeth 57 engage with the half-width teeth 70.<br>
As has been explained above, the coupling between the units wheel 24 and the tens wheel 26 is such that after each ten step-wise rotations of the units wheel 24 the tens wheel 2 6 is rotated by one step, thereby increasing the combination of tens and hundreds numbers on the outer surface of the units wheel 24. It should, be noted that Figure 5A shows a situation in which no<br><br>
WO 2004/012801	PCT/EP2003/008432<br>
33<br>
numbers of the units wheel 24 and the tens wheel 26 are visible through the opening 4 of the lower shell 1, since the projection 69 of the tens wheel 26 covers the respective number of the units wheel 24 so as to indicate that the medicament chamber 8 is empty.<br>
As described above, when the flap 21 is rotated from its horizontal first position to its second position upon an inhalation process initiated by the user (see Figure 11) , the yoke 22 is slightly rotated clockwise (in Figure 11) so that the dose protector 19 is moved from its closed position to its open position. Furthermore, by this clockwise rotation of the yoke 22, the projection or cantilever 45 of the yoke 22 is also slightly moved clockwise along the inclination of the next drive tooth 58 of the units wheel 24 so as to bring the thickening 46 of the cantilever 4 5 into engagement with the respective drive tooth 58. Up to this point, no actuation of the units wheel 24 and the tens wheel 26 has taken place.<br>
After inhalation, the user closes the cover 2 of the powder inhaler. With the closing of the cover 2, the slide 15 is moved backward from its inhalation position to its filling position by means of the coupling between the projections 28 of the slide 15 and the profiled cam tracks 31 of the cover 2.<br>
As shown in Figure 12, this backward movement of the slide 15 causes a counter clockwise rotation (as regards the view depicted in Figure 12) of the yoke 22, since the prolongation 47 of the yoke 22 is moved together with the slide 15 backward. The counter clockwise rotation of the yoke 22 is supported by the drive spring 23 which is allowed to be discharged and decompressed upon backward movement of the slide 15. Due to this counter clockwise rotation of the yoke 22, the cantilever 45 is also rotated counter clockwise, thereby also rotating the units wheel 24 counter clockwise by one step (as regards the view de-<br><br>
WO 2004/012801	PCT/EP2003/008432<br>
34<br>
picted in Figure 12) which results in decreasing the number of doses left in the medicament chamber 8, which is visible through the opening fear of the lower shell 1. As a matter of course, the dose counting unit can also be arranged such that it does not display the number of doses remaining in the medicament chamber 8, but the number of doses already taken by the user.<br>
Furthermore, since the yoke 22 and the drive spring 23 are moved back into their initial positions, the end 33 of the drive spring 23 urges the flap 21 back into its horizontal first position (as shown in Figure 12), thereby resetting the flag 38. Moreover, ±n this situation, the yoke 22 is again held by the engagement of its arm 43 with the feature 40 of the flap 21. Thus, the whole powder inhaler has been transferred into its initial position again.<br>
Another advantage associated with the flag 38 is that it may be pushed down by fingers of a user so as to effect a manual override of the inhalation actuated mechanism. This would enable the user to take the dose if the user is not able to generate a sufficient force in order to actuate the inhalation actuated mechanism.<br>
On completely closing the cover 2, there will be an audible click signalling that the cover is closed. Preferably, the powder inhaler will require the cover 2 to be completely closed to function correctly.<br>
Finally/ the deagglomerator arrangement 16 (cyclone) of the powder inhalex should be briefly discussed.<br>
The purpose of this deagglomerator arrangement is to produce clearly defined turbulences within the inhalation channel 27 so as to pulverize agglomerations of the medicament. By the swirling airflow within the deagglomerator arrangement 16, the active<br><br>
WO 2004/012801	PCT/EP2003/008432<br>
35<br>
part of the formulation is disaggregated from the respective carrier.<br>
In principle the deagglomerator arrangement of the present invention comprises a rotationslly symmetrical vortex chamber, at least one substantially tangential air inlet, and an outlet or exit for outputting the air with the deagglomerated powdered medicament, the outlet being spaced from the air inlet in the longitudinal axial direction of the vortex chamber. The general structure of the deagglomerator arrangement, for example, can be taken from Figure 6A, Figure 6B, Figure 7A, and Figure 17.<br>
In addition, the structure of the deagglomerator arrangement, which is generally not restricted to the usage in powder inhalers as described in connection with the above drawings, will be explained in detail by reference to Figure 26 and Figure 27, respectively.<br>
Figure 26 shows a schematic perspective view of the deagglomerator arrangement (cyclone) according to a preferred embodiment, the deagglomerator arrangement being constructed to produce a very strong cyclonic flow within the deagglomerator arrangement resulting in a very strong velocity gradient. It is to be noted that Figure 2 6 is a schematic view to explain the design and the key features of the cyclone according to the preferred embodiment, but Figure 26 does not show the cyclone exactly as it is implemented in the above described powder inhaler. The implementation of the cyclone in the powder inhaler, for example, can be taken from Figure A or Figure 17.<br>
As can be taken from Figures 2 6, the deagglomerator arrangement 16 has an opening in its bottom which disembogues into a vortex chamber: 73. The vortex chamber 73 is designed substantially ro-tationally symmetrical. In addition, there are two air inlet conduits 75 which direct air substantially tangentially into the vortex chamber 73. As can be seen from Figure 26, air inlet win-<br><br>
WO 2004/012801	PCT/EP2003/008432<br>
36<br>
dov/s 76 are formed in the upper surface of the air inlet conduits 7 5 which for example cover 80° of the air inlet conduits 75 so as to enable entry of air from above into the air inlet conduits 75. The base section of the vortex chamber 73, in general, has an elliptical cross-section. As depicted in Figure 26, there is an outlet 7 4 formed in the upper end of the vortex chamber 73, the outlet 7 4 being spaced from the opening for the supply of the powdered medicament and both air inlets in the longitudinal axial direction of the vortex chamber 73. In particular, the outlet 74 is aligned coaxially to the longitudinal central axis of the vortex chamber 73 and extends along this longitudinal central axis. In particular, the outlet 74 has a substantially circular cross-section, the diameter of this circular cross-section being smaller than the diameter of the elliptical cross-section of the vortex chamber 73.<br>
Figure 27 shows a cross-sectional view of the deagglomerator arrangement in accordance with a sectional plane which horizontally intersects the deagglomerator arrangement 16 and the vortex chamber 73, respectively. The view depicted in Figure 27 could be regarded as a bottom view of the deagglomerator arrangement 16 as well.<br>
In Figure 27, the vortex chamber 73 and the circular outlet 74, which disembogues into the inhalation channel 27, are depicted. Although the horizontal cross-section of the base section of the vortex chamber 73 has a substantially elliptical shape, the cross-section of the base section of the vortex chamber 7 3 can also be defined by an imaginary circle which can be laid inside the base section of the vortex chamber 73 on a horizontal plane intersecting both air inlet conduits 75 such that the circumference or periphery of this circle just touches the inside surfaces of both side walls 78 at places which are diametrically opposed to one another without extending beyond the side walls of the vortex chamber 73. In particular, these diametrically op-<br><br>
WO 2004/012801	PCT/EP2003/008432<br>
37<br>
posed places of the side walls 7 8 are those places of the side-walls 78 where both air inlets of the air inlet conduits 75 dis-embogue into the vortex chamber 73. In Figure 27, the respective "base" circle is depicted with a dotted line and assigned with reference numeral 77. The air inlets are arranged along the circumference of the "base" circle 77.<br>
Studies have shown that the diameter d of this "base" circle 77 has an important influence on the deagglomerator effect of the cyclone. For example, if the diameter d is too small, the flow resistance is too high. On the other hand, if the diameter d is too large, the flow resistance is too small resulting only in a minor improvement of the efficiency of the deagglomerator arrangement 16.<br>
Comprehensive studies of the geometry of the deagglomerator arrangement 16 in terms of the flow resistance of the device and the quality of the cyclonic flow effected inside the vortex chamber 73 show that a very good efficiency of the device can be obtained if the diameter d is between 6 mm and 10 mm, preferably 6 mm ( d ( 8 mm.<br>
For example, if d is 6 ram, a flow rate of 30 1/min at a pressure of 4 kPa can be obtained. The cyclonic flow inside the vortex chamber 73 is of good quality. Nevertheless, the required increase in the width of the air inlets or in the outlet diameter to allow a higher target flow rate (for example 60 1/min at 4 kPa) would presumably result in a degradation of the quality of the cyclone. This is because the dimensions of the air inlets or of the outlet would be too large in comparison to the dimensions of the main section of the cyclone, that is the dimensions of the vortex chamber 73.<br>
Therefore, it may be recommendable to use a larger diameter d of the "base" circle 77. A very compact design of the cyclone 16 and, in addition, the above-mentioned target flow rate in the<br><br>
WO 2004/012801	PCT/EP2003/008432<br>
38<br>
range of 60 1/min at 4 kPa can be obtained if the diameter d of the "base" circle 77 is in the range of 8 mm. Larger diameters d of the "base" circle 77 do not lead to further significant improvements of the flow pattern inside the vortex chamber 73 over that which can be achieved with a diameter d - 8 mm. Therefore, the diameter d = 8 mm is considered as a preferred embodiment of the cyclone 16.<br>
As depicted in Figure 27, the deagglomerator arrangement or cyclone 16 according to this embodiment has two air inlets assigned with the respective air inlet conduits 75. Both air inlets disemboguing into the vortex chamber 73 are arranged diametrically opposed to one another and preferably have a width or a diameter of d/5. As shown in Figures 26 and 27, the side walls 78 separating the air inlet conduits 75 from the vortex chamber 73 end in a fillet which may have an end radius of 0.3 mm, for example. The side walls 78 may have a thickness of 0.6 mm, for example .<br>
The cross-sectional structure of the deagglomerator arrangement 16 is such that a respective semicircle or arc 7 9, whose centre is on the diameter connecting both air inlets or both end portions of the side walls 78, connects the outer wall of one air inlet 7 5 with the inner surface of the opposing side wall 78 of the vortex chamber 7 3 at a place where this side wall 78 intersects with the respective other air inlet. As can be seen from Figure 27, this applies to both outer peripheral portions of the vortex chamber 73 and to both air inlets/air inlet conduits 7 5, respectively. The side walls of the air inlet conduits 7 5 are concentric to the side walls 78 of the vortex chamber 73. However, the semicircular or arched (curved) wall portions 79 of the vortex chamber 7 3 are non-concentric relative to the interior of the vortex chamber 73, i.e. the "base" circle 77. This contributes to a very effective deagglomeration within the vortex chamber 73.<br><br>

The structure shown in Figure 27 of the deagglomerator arrangement or cyclone 16 may be extruded over a height of 7.7 mm, for example. The inhalation channel 27, that is the outlet cylinder extending from the circular outlet 74, preferably has a circular diameter of 0.75d and may be extruded on top of the vortex chamber 73 over a height of 37 mm, for example. The above-mentioned top inlet window 76, covering 80° of the air inlet conduits 75, may be extruded over 2 mm to provide the channels through which the air may enter into the device from the top of these windows.<br>
Figures 28A, 28B and 28C show a perspective view, a bottom view and a top view, respectively, of another embodiment of a dosing sub-assembly 13 of a powder inhaler according to the invention. As can be seen, the container 7 comprises a medicament chamber 8 having an elliptical cross-section. Inside the medicament chamber 8f side walls 80 tapering or being slanted downward are provided, thereby facilitating the filling of the dosing recess of the slide, when it is in its filling position, by gravity. Again, the desiccant chamber 9 is separated from the medicament chamber 8 by a permeable membrane 10.<br>
The dosing sub-assembly 13 of this embodiment comprises a deag-glomerator arrangement (cyclone) 16 similar to that described above. From Figure 28C, the wall portions 79 being non-concentric to the interior diameter of the vortex chamber 7 3 are evident. Furthermore, Figure 28C also shows the tangential air inlet conduits 75.<br>
As regards the dosing sub-assembly of Figure 28, generally reference can be made to the above description of the foregoing drawings.<br><br>
