PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF SUBSTITUTED HALOGENATED ANILINE<br>
This invention relates to a method for the preparation of substituted halogenated anilines from substituted halogenated 1-chlorobenzenes, especially to substituted fluoroanilines from substituted 1-chlorofluorobenzenes.<br>
For Example 3,5-difluoroaniIine is used in the synthesis of important agricultural compounds such as diflufenzopyr. The currently available synthetic procedures for 3,5-di-fluoroaniiine are expensive and corrosive. One synthesis uses the expensive 2,4-di-fluoroaniline as a starting material. Other synthetic routes are also high cost because they either involve expensive reagents or have low yields. As a result there is a need for a more economic commercial process to produce this intermediate.<br>
This invention relates to a method for the preparation of substituted halogenated anilines from substituted halogenated chlorobenzenes, especially substituted fluoroanilines from substituted 1-chlorofluorobenzenes in high yield. The substituted halogenated anilines are prepared by selectively reacting the chlorine of the substituted halogenated 1-chlorobenzene and an imine in the presence of a transition metal catalyst complex to form an N-aryl imine that is then transformed with or without isolation to the corresponding primary amine.<br>

(diphenyiphosphino)ferrocene (dppf) (46 mgt 0.03 mol%), sodium fert-butoxide (37g, 1.4 eq, xylenes (90 mL), 1-chIoro-3,5-difluorobenzene (49.2g, 0.33 mol) and benzophenone imine (50gt 0.28 mol). The mixture was refluxed for 8 hours until GC analysis confirmed that the benzophenone imine had been consumed. The reaction mixture was cooled slightly, and 150 mL of 2M HCI was added slowly to the reaction mixture with some gas evolution and the mixture was refluxed with sufficient agitation for 45 minutes. While still warm, the reaction mixture was put in a separatory funnel and the aqueous layer was collected. An additional 90 mL of xylenes was added to the separatory funnel and the organic layer was washed with 4 x 100mL 1M HCI. The acidic fractions were combined and made alkaline with aqueous cone ammonium hydroxide. The free amine was extracted with 250 mL methyl fe/t-butyl ether. The organic layer was dried over magnesium sulfate and concentrated in vacuo to yield the expected product in 89% yield.<br>
Example 2: 3,5-dichloroaniline<br>
A 50 mL 3 neck round bottom flask was oven dried, cooled under nitrogen, and charged with 14.50 g of xylenes.

The aromatic imine intermediate was then hydrolyzed with 22 mL of 2 N HCI (aq) at 70 °C for 45 minutes. The hydrochloride salt of dichloroaniline precipitated out of solution when cooled to room temperature. The crude hydrochloride salt was collected by filtration using a buchner funnel and then washed with methyl-tert. butyl ether. The dichloroanaline salt was then added to 30 mL of methyl-tert. butyl ether and pH adjusted to 12 using 50% NaOH.
