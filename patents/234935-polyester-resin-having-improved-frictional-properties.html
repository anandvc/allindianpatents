3. PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner<br>
in which it is to be performed:	   	   	<br><br><br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
This invention relates to an improved process for continuous production of high molecular weight polyester resin having IV up to 1dl/g produced from low molecular weight crystalline prepolymer having IV of about 0.1 dl/g to about 0.4 dl/g comprising anti-stiction additive for lowering coefficient of friction (COF) in the moulded articles.<br>
Particularly, this invention relates to an improved process for continuous production of high molecular weight polyester resin comprising about 0.002 % to about 0.3 % of precipitated silica having an average particle size of 0.5 to 50 microns to improve the frictional properties of polyester articles.<br>
This invention also relates to high molecular weight polyester resin having IV up to 1dl/g produced comprising anti-stiction additive for lowering coefficient of friction (COF).<br>
This invention also relates to use of high molecular weight polyester resin comprising anti-stiction additive for the productions of films, sheets and beverage containers such as bottles with improved frictional properties.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
PET homopolymers and copolymers are widely used in carbonated soft drink (CSD) bottles. These bottles are being produced by injection stretch blow moulding process with high-speed blow moulding machines. One major problem faced while transporting or handling the CSD containers at different stages is that due to the high friction encountered between surfaces of the containers, their aesthetic value as well as physical properties get affected. This excessive friction can lead to process or filling line interruptions that are economically undesirable.<br>
2<br><br>
The problem occurs after the polyester polymer has been moulded into performs or various types of stretch blow moulded containers. The containers are sometimes conveyed directly into a palletizing station and then shipped to a filling plant or they are conveyed to a labeling and filling line contained within the same plant. The problem can also occur during the shipment of closely packed blown containers from one site to another. Problem is more severe when container sidewalls are smooth and thus more friction occurs between the containers during handling or transportation.<br>
During the production of injection-moulded preforms, preforms are packed in a large box, which contains more than 500 preforms. Preforms have a tendency to stick on top of one another thus reducing their packing efficiency in the box. As a result, less quantity of the preforms are kept in the box than the optimum capacity thus increases transportation cost for the preform manufacturer. The high level of friction between the preforms results in the damage of the surface of the preforms and thus increasing the rejection rate. Higher sticking tendency causes problems in the feeder of the stretch blow-moulding machine and thus reduces the productivity of the machine than the optimum.<br>
CSD bottles are usually produced with 2 or 2.5L volume using injection stretch blow moulding machine. If the bottle sidewalls are smooth, the surface area that comes in the contact with two adjacent bottles increases. Since PET inherently has high coefficient of friction (COF), containers become entangled and tip over or just stop moving in the conveying line after blowing or filling. Such interruption obviously causes undesirable loss of productivity and increases maintenance of the filling or conveying process. This problem also arises during the shipment of bottle from one site to another. Such type of friction or tip over causes unwanted scratches thus deteriorating the appearance of bottles.<br>
A high coefficient of friction (COF) prevents adjacent containers on a multiple-row conveying line from moving (turning or slipping) during conveying. When the<br>
3<br><br>
conveying line changes direction, sometimes as much as 90 degrees, the containers may become entangled and either stay upright and stop the feed or tip over and stop the line. In either event, someone has to monitor continuously these problematic areas to keep the line moving.<br>
A container having low coefficient of friction is useful for reducing or eliminating the process down time and also eliminates or reduces the need for someone to constantly monitor the process. A container having low coefficient of friction is also useful to reduce or eliminate the frictional forces between two adjacent bottles which are responsible for scratches while the shipment of containers from one site to other. This helps in maintaining the appearance of bottle in terms of clarity / gloss.<br>
The sticking tendency of the preforms or bottles may arise due to the static electricity and / or rough surfaces. However, the exact reason for sticking is still unknown.<br>
Generally, two major and distinct process steps are involved in the production of high molecular weight polyesters. These two steps include: melt polymerization and solid-state polymerization (SSP). In the conventional polymerization process for producing high IV polyester, base polymer having IV of about 0.4 dl/g to about 0.65 dl/g is produced by melt polymerization process. These base chips usually are cylindrical or circular shape. Base polyester is amorphous in nature. Base polyester resin is then subjected for solid-state polymerization after crystallizing it in a crystallizer so as to avoid sintering or lump formation in the SSP reactor. Using SSP process, depending on the application, different IV resin can be produced. Conventional polymerization processes of polyester are disclosed in patents US 3,405,098, US 3,544,525, US 4,245,253, US 4,238,593, and US 5,408,035. In this conventional polymerization process, the use of additives such as siliceous compounds, barium sulphate, calcium carbonate and many others for improving frictional properties of finished articles such as preforms, containers<br>
4<br><br>
are disclosed in patents US 3,968,183, US 5,830,544, US 6,323,271 and also in the patent applications US 2002009564, 20030039783 and US 20030055207.<br>
Another polymerization process which is different than conventional polymerization process is disclosed in US 5,510,454, 5,532,333, 5,540,868, 5,714,262, 5,830,982, and 6,451,966 which are incorporated herein as reference in their entirety. In this polymerization process, a crystalline hemispherical prepolymer having IV of about 0,1 dl/g to about 0.4 dl/g is formed using particle former process. The base polyester chips produced with this process are crystalline in nature. Particle former process is disclosed in US 5,510,454. These crystalline prepolymer chips can then be used as a precursor for solid-state polymerization for increasing the IV from about 0.5 dl/g to about 1 dl/g. Polymerization process for the production of high molecular weight PET from the low molecular weight crystalline prepolymer is disclosed in patents US 5,510,454, US 5,532,333, US 5,540,868, US 5,714,262, US 5,830,982, and US 6,451,966. However, none of these patents discloses the composition for the production of polyester resin having anti-stiction additive for the improvement of frictional properties of finished articles such as preforms and containers.<br>

Example 1:<br>
PET prepolymer having IV of 0.245 dl/g was prepared by melt-phase polymerization process. Purified terephthalic acid and monoethylene glycol (MEG) were charged in 1:2 ratio in reactor. 2 wt % Isophthalic acid and 1.5 wt % diethylene glycol (DEG) were added in the reactor. Esterification reaction was carried out at 280°C. About 200 ppm silica was added in the oligomer. The oligomer obtained was further polymerized at 290°C to raise the IV up to 0.245 dl/g. About 290ppm of antimony was added as a catalyst and 10 ppm P was added as a thermal stabilizer. A static mixer is put after every injection nozzle for adding any suitable additive, co monomer for better dispersion. The low IV prepolymer melt was then passed through the 1.5 mm diameter orifice to form droplets on a continuous moving steel belt of particle former. These droplets were then crystallized on the particle former maintained at a temperature between 110 to 160°C and then collected for carrying out solid-state polymerization.<br>
