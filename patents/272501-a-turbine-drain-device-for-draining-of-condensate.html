				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The invention generally relates to draining of saturated water which by virtue of<br>
getting drained directly to a flash tanker at near vacuum conditions is subjected<br>
to flashing of the medium resulting in damage to the downstream parts by<br>
erosion of the high velocity stream. The invention, in particular relates to high<br>
pressure drain valves. More particularly, the invention relates to isolating cum<br>
draining devices known as multi-stage Turbine drain or Angle drain devices.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Flow control devices oftenly called Valves are used for high pressure drop or<br>
blow-down service. These devices generally follow an angle pattern which is<br>
often the most opted type for the application and layout purposes. One of the<br>
applications of such devices is in area where very high pressure drop is normally<br>
encountered, and such a device is then as high pressure dropping isolation<br>
device. The valves can further be used for draining of media.<br>
The purpose of the drain valve more specifically in a drain line is to drain the<br>
condensate in the line which has accumulated at the time of tripping or low load<br>
or other reasons which may result in the formation of the condensate. The<br>
condensate is to be removed from the line before loading the turbine for the<br>
reason that any water particle or wet steam impinging on the turbine blade will<br>
result in heavy damage to the turbine blades as well as the intermediate<br>
equipments. During normal operation of the power plant the subject drain valve<br>
is to be kept in leak tight closure condition so that the wastage of steam which is<br><br>
indirectly wastage of power generated is avoided. Before loading the turbine, the<br>
valve is opened and then condensate drained and then the closed at the time of<br>
loading the turbine. In a normal Globe or Single Stage valve when saturated<br>
water is exposed to very low pressure regions, the water flashes down to steam<br>
causing heavy sound and vibration. The harmful effect of erosion of downstream<br>
and similar deterrent effects are a perennial problem in such installations.<br>
Conventionally a Globe Valve is used for draining of the condensate from the<br>
turbine line. The conventional Globe Valve is characterised by a through port<br>
where the fluid passes in its traditional right-turn path thereby undergoes a<br>
pressure drop characterised by the valve. For saturated water, a slight pressure<br>
drop results in steam formation thereby resulting in heavy increase in the<br>
downstream volume, which causes severe choking or blocking in the discharge of<br>
the valve reducing the Valve capacity. Also, a typical globe valve is having a<br>
single stage control only and the outlet tank pressure largely influences the flow<br>
to be handled by the valve. The result will be a severe erosion of the<br>
downstream piping of the valve ends. The seat also gets damaged in this valve<br>
which results in heavy loss of steam &amp; power. The disc get eroded rapidly which<br>
calls for repeated servicing of the valve.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore an object of the invention to propose a multistage draining device<br>
for high pressure drop, which would cause limited/low flashing.<br><br>
Another object of the invention is to propose a multistage draining device for<br>
high pressure drop, which would protect the valve disc from erosion.<br>
A still another object of the invention is to propose a multistage draining device<br>
for high pressure drop, which minimizes loss of steam and power.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, there is provided a turbine drain device for draining of condensate<br>
comprising; a body or shell which encompasses the fluid; the body having an<br>
inlet aligned to an inlet piping from the turbine, and an outlet at right angle to<br>
the inlet pipe; a yoke connected to the body either by gasket bolting or welding;<br>
a Seatring made of hard material in cast form, which is firmly held onto the<br>
body; a Stem which has one of an integral seating and profiles for determining<br>
the area of flow permitted in the downstream stages. The Seatring comprises a<br>
diverging area which determines the three stage throttle area for expansion of<br>
the medium, and an adjustable leak-prevention means is provided to arrest<br>
leakage of the medium through the body.<br>

invention.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE<br>
INVENTION.<br>
Figure - 1 illustrates a turbine drain device of the invention. The device<br>
comprising a body (001) or shell encompassing the fluid, said body (001) having<br>
an inlet aligned from an inlet piping turbine and an outlet at right angle to the<br>
inlet pipe; a yoke (004) connected to the body (001) either by gasket bolting or<br>
welding, the Yoke (004) housing the bottom ears of Gland Bolting; a Seatring<br>
