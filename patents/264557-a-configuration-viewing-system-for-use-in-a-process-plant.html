				<td>INTEGRATED CONFIGURATION SYSTEM<br>
FOR USE IN A PROCESS PLANT<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] The present disclosure relates generally to configuring a process plant and, more<br>
particularly, to an integrated configuration system for use in a process plant that integrates the<br>
viewing and configuration activities associated with multiple applications used within the<br>
process plant.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART<br>
[0002] i Process control systems, like those used in chemical, petroleum or other processes,<br>
typically include one or more centralized or decentralized process controllers<br>
communicatively coupled to at least one host or operator workstation and to one or.more<br>
process control and instrumentation devices such as, for example, field d'evices, via analog,<br>
digital or combined analog/digital buses. Field devices, which may be, for example, valves,<br>
valve positioners, switches, transmitters, and sensors (e.g., temperature, pressure, and flow<br>
rate sensors), are located within the process plant environment, and perform functions within<br>
the process such as opening or closing valves, measuring process parameters, increasing or<br>
decreasing fluid flow, etc. Smart field devices such as field devices conforming to the wellknown<br>
FOUNDATION™ Fieldbus (hereinafter "Fieldbus") protocol may also perform<br>
control calculations, alarming functions, and other control functions commonly implemented<br>
within the process controller.<br>
[0003] The process controllers, which are typically located within the process plant<br>
environment, receive signals indicative of process measurements or process variables made<br>
by or associated with the field devices and/or other information pertaining to the field<br>
devices, and execute controller applications. The controller applications implement, for<br>
example, different control modules that make process control decisions, generate control<br>
signals based on the received information, and coordinate with the control modules or blocks<br>
being performed in the field devices such as HART® and Fieldbus field devices. The control<br>
modules in the process controllers send the control signals over the communication lines to<br>
the field devices to thereby control the operation of the process.<br>
 [0004] Information from the field devices and the process controllers is typically made<br>
available to one or more other hardware devices such as, for example, operator workstations,<br>
personal computers, handheld devices, data historians, report generators, centralized<br>
databases, etc. to enable an operator to perform desired functions with respect to the process<br>
such as, for example, changing settings of the process control routine, modifying the<br>
operation of the control modules within the process controllers or the smart field devices,<br>
viewing the current state of the process, viewing alarms generated by field devices and<br>
process controller simulating the operation of the process for the purpose of training<br>
personnel or testing the process control software, etc.<br>
[0005] While a typical process plant has many process control and instrumentation devices<br>
such as valves, transmitters, sensors, etc. connected to one or more process controllers, which<br>
execute software that controls these devices during the operation of the process, there are<br>
many other supporting devices that are also necessary for or related to process operation.<br>
These additional devices include, for example, power supply equipment, power generation<br>
and distribution equipment, rotating equipment such as turbines, motors, etc., which are<br>
located at numerous places in a typical plant. While this additional equipment does not<br>
necessarily create or use process variables and, in many instances, is not controlled or even<br>
coupled to a process controller for the purpose of affecting the process operation, this<br>
equipment is nevertheless important to, and ultimately necessary for proper operation of the<br>
process.<br>
[0006] Operator workstations, which are typically connected to the process controllers<br>
through communication connections such as a direct or wireless bus, Ethernet, modem, phone<br>
line, and the like, have processors and memories that are adapted to run software or firmware<br>
such as process control configuration applications. As an example, each of the DeltaV™ and<br>
Ovation control systems, sold by Emerson Process Management, includes multiple<br>
applications stored within and executed by different devices located at diverse places within a<br>
process plant. A process control configuration application, which may reside in one or more<br>
operator workstations, enables a user to create or change process control modules and<br>
download these process control modules via a data highway to distributed process controllers<br>
or field devices in the DeltaV™ and Ovation systems. Typically, these control modules are<br>
made up of communicatively interconnected function blocks, which are objects in an objectoriented<br>
programming protocol that perform functions within the control scheme based on<br>
inputs thereto, and provide outputs to other function blocks within the control scheme. Each<br>
process controller and, in some cases, the smart field devices, may store and execute a<br>
controller application that runs the control modules assigned and downloaded thereto to<br>
implement actual process control functionality.<br>
[0007] The process control configuration application may also allow a user to create or<br>
change user interfaces, which are used by user interface applications to display data to an<br>
operator and to enable the operator to change settings, such as set points, within the process<br>
control routine. The user interface applications, which may be run on one or more operator<br>
workstations, receive data from the controller applications via the data highway and display<br>
this data to configuration engineers, process control operators, maintenance personnel, plant<br>
managers or supervisors, etc. using the user interfaces, and may provide any of a number of<br>
'differenrvieWFiUch as arf engineenng view, an operator's view, a maintenance view, a<br>
management view, etc.<br>
[0008] User interface applications are typically implemented on a system-wide basis in one<br>
or more of the operator workstations, and provide preconfigured displays to the operator or<br>
maintenance personnel regarding the operating state of the process plant, or the devices<br>
within the process plant. Typically, these displays take the form of alarming displays that<br>
receive alarms generated by the process controllers or other devices within the process plant,<br>
control displays indicating the operating state of the process controllers and other devices<br>
within the process plant, maintenance displays indicating the operating state of the devices<br>
within the process plant, etc.<br>
[0009] Many process plants, and especially those that use smart field devices, include<br>
applications that are used to help monitor and maintain the devices within the plant,<br>
regardless of whether these devices are process control and instrumentation devices or are<br>
other types of devices. For example, the Asset Management Solutions (AMS) Suite<br>
applications, sold by Emerson Process Management, enables communication with and stores<br>
data pertaining to field devices to ascertain and track the operating state of the field devices.<br>
An example of such a system is disclosed in U.S. Patent Number 5,960,214 entitled<br>
"Integrated Communication Network for use in a Field Device Management System."<br>
[0010] In some instances, the AMS application may be used to communicate with a field<br>
device to change parameters within the field device, to cause the field device to run<br>
applications on itself such as, for example, self-calibration routines or self-diagnostic<br>
routines, to obtain information about the status or health of the field device, etc. This<br>
information may include, for example, status information (e.g., whether an alarm or other<br>
similar event has occurred), device configuration information (e.g., the manner in which the<br>
field device is currently or may be configured and the type of measuring units used by the<br>
field device), device parameters (e.g., the field device range values and other parameters),<br>
etc. This information may be stored within the field device or within a field device database<br>
associated with the field device, and may be used by a maintenance person to monitor,<br>
maintain, and/or diagnose these field devices.<br>
[0011] In addition, many process plants include equipment monitoring and diagnostic<br>
applications such as, for example, RBMware provided by CSI Systems, or any other known<br>
applications used to monitor, diagnose, and optimize the operating state of various rotating<br>
equipment. Maintenance personnel usually use these applications, to maintain and oversee<br>
the performance of rotating equipment in the plant, to determine problems with the rotating "<br>
equipment, and to determine when and if the rotating equipment must be repaired or replaced.<br>
Similarly, many process plants include power control and diagnostic applications such as<br>
those provided by, for example, Liebert and ASCO companies, to control and maintain the<br>
power generation and distribution equipment.<br>
[0012] It is also known to provide an expert system or application such as, for example, the<br>
OZ expert system currently provided by NEXUS, or any other type of expert system<br>
including, for example, any type of data mining system that uses process control variables<br>
and limited information about the operating condition of the process control routines, or<br>
function blocks or modules associated with the process control routines, to detect poorly<br>
derating loops and to provide information to an operator about suggested courses of action<br>
to correct the problem.<br>
[0013] In addition, it is known to run control optimizer applications such as, for example,<br>
real-time optimizers (RTO+), within a process plant to optimize the control activities of the<br>
process plant. Such optimizer applications typically use complex algorithms and/or models<br>
of the process plant to predict how inputs may be changed to optimize operation of the<br>
process plant with respect to some desired optimization variable such as, for example, profit.<br>
[0014] Still further, many process plants have other computers associated therewith that<br>
t '*'." execute applications related to business functions such as applications associated with<br>
ordering raw materials, and replacement parts or devices for the process plant, as well as<br>
applications related to forecasting sales and production needs.<br>
[0015] Typically, the various applications used in the same process plant are set up to be<br>
used by and configured by different people associated with the process plant. Generally<br>
speaking, configuration activities for each of these applications include providing information<br>
as to the types, locations, names, etc. of the devices disposed within the process plant as well<br>
as the manner in which the devices are communicatively interconnected to enable the<br>
applications to access information from or about those devices for use in control,<br>
maintenance and optimizer activities. Because these applications are run separately, by<br>
different people, the same configuration information is typically entered separately into the<br>
various applications at different times, resulting in the repetition of configuration activities.<br>
[0016] . For example, the process control configuration application and maintenance<br>
application typically used in the process plant are different, stand-alone programs in which a<br>
user must configure and view process set-up and other information using a process control<br>
configuration application running on a workstation. After the process is running, a user may<br>
switch ,to a separate application (or even a separate workstation) to configure a maintenance<br>
application (entering the same or similar information or data already provided to configure<br>
the process control configuration application) to view field device specific information. The<br>
configuration information may also be separately provided to an optimizer application, a<br>
business application, etc. This multi-step configuration process is time-consuming, results in •<br>
flrBundancy in engineering effort, may be inconvenient and confusing to users, requires<br>
duplicate hardware, and requires that users be trained in multiple applications, all of which<br>
lead to extra costs in terms of configuring and running the process plant.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0017] An integrated configuration viewing system for use in a process plant includes a<br>
computer readable memory and a plurality of template configuration objects stored on the<br>
computer readable memory. Each of the plurality of template configuration objects includes<br>
a graphical representation of a physical entity within the process plant, a parameter storage<br>
adapted fo communicate with the process plant to obtain and store device parameter<br>
information associated with the physical entity within the process plant, and a configuration<br>
storage adapted to store configuration parameters associated with the physical entity within<br>
the process plant. A first routine is stored on the computer readable memory and adapted to<br>
be executed on the processor to present a library section on a user interface. The library<br>
section is adapted to present depictions of the plurality of template configuration objects to a<br>
user via the user interface. A second routine is stored on the computer readable memory and<br>
adapted to be executed on the processor to present a configuration area on the user interface.<br>
And a third routine is stored oh the computer readable memory and adapted to be executed on<br>
the processor to enable a user to select one of the plurality of template configuration objects<br>
from the library section and to place the selected template configuration object within the<br>
configuration area to create a process configuration module within the configuration area.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0028] Referring now to Fig. 1, an example process plant 10 includes an integrated<br>
configuration viewing system that uses configuration objects to form process configuration<br>
modules 39 to provide enhanced control, display, and simulation functions within the plant<br>
environment. Generally, the process plant 10 includes a distributed process control system<br>
having one or more process controllers 12, which may be a pair of redundant controllers.<br>
process controller 12 is connected to one or more field devices 14 and 16 via<br>
input/output (I/O) cards or devices 18 and 19, which may be any types of I/O devices<br>
conforming to any desired communication or controller protocol. The field devices 14 and<br>
16 may be any types of field devices such as, for example, sensors, valves, transmitters,<br>
positioners, etc., and may conform to an}' desired open, proprietary or other communication<br>
or programming protocol.<br>
[0029] The process plant 10 also includes one or more user interfaces or computers 20 and<br>
22 (which may be any types of personal computers, workstations, etc.) that are accessible by<br>
plant personnel such as configuration engineers, process control operators, maintenance<br>
personnel, plant managers or supervisors, etc. The workstations 20 and 22 are coupled to the<br>
process controllers 12 via a communication line or bus 24 which may be implemented using<br>
any desired hardwired or wireless communication structure, and using any desired or suitable<br>
communication protocol such as, for example, an Ethernet protocol. The process controllers<br>
12, the I/O devices 18 and 19, and the field devices 14 and 16 generally make up a process<br>
control system.<br>
[0030] In addition, a database 28 may be connected to the communication bus 24 and<br>
operates as a data historian that collects and stores configuration information as well as online<br>
process parameter, status, and other data associated with the process controllers 12 arid field<br>
devices 14 and 16 within the process plant 10. The database 28 may operate as a<br>
configuration database to store the current configuration, including process configuration<br>
modules as described below, as well as control configuration information for the process<br>
control system within the plant 10 as downloaded to and stored within the process controllers<br>
12 and the field devices 14 and 16.<br>
[0031] While the process controllers 12, I/O devices 18 and 19, and field devices 14 and<br>
16 are typically located down within and distributed throughout the sometimes harsh plant<br>
environment, the workstations 20 and 22, and the database 28 are usually located in control<br>
rooms or other less harsh environments easily accessible by operators, maintenance<br>
personnel, etc.<br>
 [TJ032] As is known, the process controllers 12, which may be, for example, the DeltaV™<br>
and Ovation controllers sold by Emerson Process Management, store and execute a controller<br>
application that implements a control strategy using a number of different, independently<br>
executed, control modules or blocks 29. The control modules may each be made up of what<br>
are commonly referred to as function blocks, wherein each function block is a part or a<br>
subroutine of an overall control routine and operates in conjunction with other function<br>
blocks (via communications called links) to implement process control loops within the<br>
process plant 10.<br>
[0033] ' As is well known, function blocks, which may be objects in an object-oriented<br>
programming protocol, typically perform one of an input function, such as that associated<br>
with a transmitter, a sensor or other process parameter measurement device, a control<br>
function, such as that associated with a control routine that performs PID, fuzzy logic, etc.<br>
control, or an output function, which controls the operation of some device, such as a valve,<br>
to perform some physical function within the process plant 10. Of'Course, hybrid and other<br>
types of complex function blocks exist such as model predictive controllers (MFCs),<br>
optimizers, etc. It is to be understood that while the Fieldbus protocol and the DeltaV™<br>
system protocol use control modules 29 and function blocks designed and implemented in an<br>
object-oriented programming protocol, the control modules 29 may be designed using any<br>
desired control programming scheme including, for example, sequential function blocks,<br>
ladder logic, etc., and are not limited to being designed using function blocks or any other<br>
particular programming technique.<br>
[0034] In the process plant 10 illustrated in Fig. 1, the field devices connected to the<br>
process controllers 12 maybe conventional (i.e., non-smart) field devices 14 such as, for<br>
example, standard 4-20 mA devices that communicate over analog lines to the I/O device 18.<br>
Alternatively, or in addition, the field devices may be smart field devices 16 having a<br>
processor and a memory such as, for example, HART®, PROFIBUS®, Ethernet, or Fieldbus<br>
field devices, which communicate over a digital bus to the I/O device 19 using Fieldbus<br>
protocol communications. Smart field devices 16 may store and execute modules, or<br>
sub-modules such as function blocks 30 associated with the control strategy implemented in<br>
tlllFprocess controllers 12. Function blocks 30, which are illustrated in Fig. 1 as being<br>
disposed in two different ones of the Fieldbus field devices 16, maybe executed in<br>
conjunction with the execution of the control modules 29 within the process controllers 12 to<br>
implement process control as is well known. Of course, the field devices 14 and 16 may be<br>
any types of devices, such as sensors, valves, transmitters, positioners, etc., and the I/O<br>
devices 18 and 19 may be any types of I/O devices conforming to any desired communication<br>
or controller protocol such as HART®, PROFIBUS®, Fieldbus, etc.<br>
[0035] The process plant 10 also includes various rotating equipment 21 such as, for<br>
example, turbines, motors, etc. connected to the communication bus 24. Similarly, power<br>
generating and distribution'equipment 25 associated with the process plant 10 may also be<br>
connected to the communication bus 24. Of course, any other equipment and process control<br>
devices may be attached to or be part of the process plant 10, and the system described herein<br>
is not limited to the equipment specifically illustrated in Fig. 1, but may, instead or in<br>
addition, include any other types of process control equipment or devices.<br>
[0036J In the process plant 10 of Fig. 1',' the workstation 20 includes a plurality of<br>
applications and other data structures 32, which maybe accessed by any authorized user such<br>
as, for example, a configuration engineer, a process operator, a maintenance person, a plant<br>
manager or supervisor, etc. to view and provide functionality with respect to devices, units,<br>
equipment, etc. located within the process plant 10. The plurality of applications 32 is stored<br>
in a computer readable memory 34 of the workstation 20, and each of the applications or<br>
entities within the plurality of applications 32 is adapted to be executed on a processor 36<br>
associated with the workstation 20.<br>
[0037] While the entire plurality of applications 32 is illustrated as being stored on the<br>
same workstation 20, some of these applications or other entities maybe stored in and<br>
executed in other workstations or computer devices within or associated with the process<br>
plant 10 such as, for example, workstation 22. Furthermore, the applications within the<br>
plurality of applications 32 maybe broken up and executed on two or more computers or<br>
machines and may be configured to operate in conjunction with one another.<br>
|ff038] The workstation 20 may further include user interface routines or applications 35<br>
that receive and display information pertaining to the process plant 10 (or entities within or<br>
associated with the process plant 10) on a display screen 37 or display device associated with<br>
the workstation 20 such as, for example, a handheld device, laptop, other workstation, printer,<br>
etc. As will be described in more detail, the user interface applications 35 may generate one<br>
. or more user displays, such as, for example, operator, maintenance and manager displays that<br>
enable a user to view and/or retrieve relevant information about different portions of the<br>
process plant, and that enable a user to graphically browse or navigate to different portions of<br>
the process plant in a desired manner based on depictions or displays of process control areas,<br>
units, loops, devices, etc. within the,process plant 10.<br>
I0039J Generally, the plurality of applications 32 may be used in conjunction with and<br>
configured using a set of process configuration modules 39, which may provide a simulation<br>
of an operation associated with a portion of a process plant 10. The process configuration<br>
modules 39 have graphics associated thereAvith to create process graphic displays, which<br>
generally provide a display pertaining to a portion of the process plant 10. The process<br>
graphic display elements, which will be described in more detail below, are generally<br>
elements that are used by an operator's display, an engineer's display, a maintenance person's<br>
display, a plant manager's or supervisor's display, or other displays to provide information . . to<br>
a user, such as an operator, about the operation, configuration, or set-up of the process plant<br>
10 and the elements therein. An example of a process configuration module 39 is disclosed<br>
in U.S. Patent Application Sen No. 10/278,469 entitled "Smart Process Modules and Objects<br>
in Process Plants" (filed Oct. 22, 2002), which is hereby expressly incorporated by reference<br>
herein.<br>
[0040] The process configuration modules 39 may be used to simulate the operation of the<br>
process plant 10, or of some of the different elements therein connected in the manner<br>
depicted in the process graphic displays and, additionally, may be used to provide views to<br>
different users, such as operators, maintenance persons, business persons, etc. The views<br>
provide various information to these users including information generated by the<br>
applications 32. Although the process configuration modules 39 are illustrated as being<br>
stored in and executed by the workstation 20, the process configuration modules 39 maybe<br>
downloaded to and executed in any other computer associated with the process plant 10 such<br>
as, for example, workstation 22, a laptop, a handheld device, etc.<br>
(0041] Fig. 2 illustrates some of the applications and .data structures or other entities within<br>
the plurality of applications 32 stored in the computer readable memory 35 of the workstation<br>
20. In particular, a configuration application 38 may be used by, for example, a configuration<br>
engineer to create process configuration modules 39.(also called process flow modules) and<br>
the associated graphic displays. More particularly, the configuration application 38 may<br>
create process configuration modules 39 using one. or more configuration objects 42, the<br>
nature of which will be described in more detail below. Furthermore, while one<br>
' i .<br>
configuration application 38 may create the process configuration modules 39, these process<br>
configuration modules 39 may be created by separate configuration applications. Still<br>
further, different ones of the plurality of applications 32 may be located in different<br>
geographical locations from each other and/or the process plant 10 and maybe adapted to<br>
communicate via any suitable communication network such as, for example, the Internet, or<br>
other open network.<br>
[0042] A plurality of configuration objects 42 may be stored on the computer readable<br>
memory 34 in a library 40 of predefined, example or template configuration objects 42. The<br>
library 40 may be accessed, copied, and used by the configuration application 38 to create<br>
one or more process configuration modules 39. Each.process configuration module 39 is<br>
made up of or created from one or more configuration objects 42 and may include any<br>
number of objects connected together. In addition, each configuration object 42 may include<br>
one or more process flow or simulation algorithms 45, which are stored in a process<br>
configuration module memory 46.<br>
[0043] As noted above, the configuration application 38 may be used to create one or more<br>
graphic displays 41, each of which is made up of or created from one or more configuration<br>
objects, and may include any number of display elements connected together. One of the<br>
graphic displays 41 is illustrated in Fig. 2 in expanded form, and includes a depiction of a set<br>
of process elements such as, for example, valves, tanks, sensors, and flow transmitters,<br>
interconnected by connection elements, which may be, for example, pipes, conduits,<br>
electrical cables, conveyors, etc.<br>
[0044J An execution engine 48 executes or implements each of the process configuration<br>
modules 39 during runtime to create one or more process displays for an operator as defined<br>
by the graphic displays 41, and to implement simulation functionality associated with the<br>
process configuration modules 39. The execution engine 48 may use a rules database 50<br>
defining the logic to be implemented on the process configuration modules 39 as a whole,<br>
and the configuration objects 42 within those module^ 39 in particular. The execution engine<br>
48 may also use a connection matrix 52, which defines the connections between the process<br>
elements within the process plant 10 as well as within the process configuration modules 39<br>
1 t o implement t h e functionality f o r t h e process configuration [0045] Fig. 2 illustrates one of the configuration objects 42e in more detail. While the<br>
configuration object 42e is illustrated as being one of the template configuration objects, it<br>
should be understood that other configuration objects will generally include the same or<br>
similar elements, features, parameters, etc!1 as described wjth respect to the configuration<br>
object 42e. In addition, it should be understood that the specifics or values of these elements,<br>
features and parameters maybe changed or varied from configuration object 42 to<br>
configuration object 42 depending on the nature and use of that configuration object 42.<br>
Furthermore, while the configuration object 42e may be an object Avithin an object-oriented<br>
programming environment and thus include data stores, inputs and outputs, and methods<br>
associated therewith, this configuration object 42e may be created by and implemented<br>
within any other desired programming paradigm or protocol.<br>
[0046] As will be understood, the configuration object 42e, before being instantiated, is an<br>
object that is associated with a particular entity such as a physical or a logical entity within<br>
the process plant 10 of Fig. 1. However, after being copied and instantiated, the<br>
configuration object 42e may be tied to a particular entity within the process plant 10 so as to<br>
simulate the operation of that particular entity. In any event, the configuration object 42e<br>
includes a data store 53 that is used to communicate with the entity within the process plant<br>
10 to which the configuration object 42e pertains and store device parameter information or<br>
data received from or pertaining to the entity with which the configuration object 42e is<br>
associated. The data store 53 generally includes a data store 53a that stores general or<br>
permanent information about the entity to which the configuration object 42e pertains, like<br>
manufacturer, revision, name, type, etc. A data store 53b may store variable or changing<br>
data, such as parameter data, status data, input and output data, cost or other data about the<br>
entity to which the configuration object 42e pertains, including configuration parameters<br>
associated with the entity, as well as data associated with the entity as it has existed in the<br>
past or as it now exists within the process plant 10. Of course, the configuration object 42e<br>
may be configured or programmed to receive this data (e.g., cost data) on a periodic or nonperiodic<br>
basis, from the entity itself via any desired communication link, from the historian<br>
28 via the communication bus 24, or in any other desired manner.<br>
J0047] A data store 53c may store a graphical representation of the entity within the<br>
process plant 10 to which the configuration object 42e pertains, and which is used to produce<br>
the graphic displays 41 to the operator via an operator interface, such as the display screen 37<br>
associated with the workstation 20 of Fig. 1. Of. course, the graphical representation may<br>
include place holders (marked by underlines within the data store 53c) for information about<br>
the entity such as information defined by the parameter or other variable data about the entity<br>
as stored in the data store 53b. This parameter data may be displayed in the graphical place<br>
holders when the graphical representation is presented to the operator on the display device<br>
37 as part of the graphic displays 41.<br>
[0048] The graphical representation (and the configuration object 42e) may also include<br>
predefined connection points (marked by an "X" in the data store 53c) that enable a<br>
configuration engineer or operator to attach upstream or downstream components to the<br>
process element, as depicted by the graphical representation. Of course, these connection<br>
points also enable the configuration object 42e to be aware of the elements connected to that<br>
configuration object as configured within a process configuration module 39 and may specify<br>
a type of connection element that may be used such as, for example, a pipe, a duct, a stream<br>
associated with that element, etc.<br>
 [0049] The configuration object 42e may also include one or more inputs 54 and outputs<br>
56 to enable communication with other configuration objects within or outside of a process<br>
configuration module 39 in which the configuration.object 42e is used. As will be described<br>
in more detail below, the connections of the inputs 54 and outputs 56 to other configuration<br>
objects 42 may be configured by a configuration engineer during configuration of the process<br>
plant 10 by simply connecting other configuration objects 42 to these inputs 54 and outputs<br>
56, or by specifying particular communications that are to take place between configuration<br>
objects 42.<br>
[0050] Some of these inputs 54 and outputs 56 may be defined as being connected to i the<br>
configuration objects connected at the predefined connection points for the configuration<br>
object as discussed above. These inputs 54 and outputs 56 may also be determined or defined<br>
by a set of rules within the rules database 50 and the connection matrix 52 defining the<br>
connections between different devices or entities within the process plant 10. The inputs 54<br>
and the outputs 56, which include data stores or buffers associated therewith will.generally be<br>
used to provide communications of data from other configuration objects to the configuration<br>
object 42e, or to provide communications of data stored within or generated by the<br>
configuration object 42e to other configuration objects. These inputs 54 and outputs 56 may<br>
also be used to provide communications between the configuration object 42e and other<br>
.objects, within the process, control system such as, for example, qpntrpl modules 29 located<br>
within the process controllers 12, smart field devices 16, etc.<br>
[0051] As illustrated in Fig: 2, the configuration object 42e also includes a method storage<br>
58 that is used to store zero, one or more methods 60 (illustrated as methods 60a, 60b and 60c<br>
in Fig. 2) to be implemented by the configuration object 42e during execution of a process<br>
configuration module 39 by the execution engine 48. Generally, the methods 60 stored in the<br>
method storage 58 will use the data stored within the data storage portions 53a and 53b and<br>
data obtained from other configuration objects or even data from other sources such as, for<br>
example, the configuration database or historian 28, via the inputs 54 and the outputs 56 to<br>
determine information about the process plant 10 or an entity within the process plant 10.<br>
For example, the methods 60 may determine poor or bad operating conditions associated with<br>
ffie entity defined by the configuration object 42e, errors associated with that or other entities<br>
within the process plant 10, etc.<br>
[0052] The methods 60 may be preconfigured or provided based on the type or class of<br>
configuration object and will generally be executed each time the configuration object 42e is<br>
executed within the execution engine 48 during runtime. Some example methods 60 that<br>
may be provided within a configuration object such as, for example, the configuration object<br>
42e, include detecting leaks, dead band, dead time, movement, variability, condition<br>
monitoring, computing costs, or other conditions associated with the entity.<br>
[0053] The methods 60 may also be provided to help simulate the operation of the process<br>
entity associated with the configuration object or the material flowing through that process<br>
entity. Thus, the methods 60 may be provided to calculate mass balances, energy balances,<br>
flows, temperatures, compositions, vapor states, and other system-level or stream-level<br>
parameters associated with the material in the process plant 10 to simulate operation of the<br>
element and calculate expected outputs based on provided inputs, etc. Of course, these are ,<br>
but a few of the methods 60 that may be stored'in and run by a configuration object 42e, and '<br>
there are many other methods that may be used, with such methods generally being<br>
determined by the type of entity being represented, the manner in which that entity is<br>
connected in and used in a process plant 10 as well as other factors.<br>
[0054] While the configuration object 42e may store and execute methods 60 that detect<br>
system-level conditions, errors, etc., these methods 60 may also be used to determine other<br>
information about devices, logical elements such as, for example, process configuration<br>
modules 39 and loops, and other non-system-level entities. If desired, the methods 60 may be<br>
programmed or provided in any desired programming language or infrastructure, such as C,<br>
C++, C#, XML, XSL, .NET, etc., or maybe referenced to or may define applicable rules<br>
within the rules database 50 that should be run for the configuration object 42e during<br>
execution.<br>
[0055] With reference to Fig. 3, a user or configuration engineer may run or execute the<br>
configuration application 38 to define the component devices, interconnections, and<br>
interrelationships within the process control environment by creating one or more process<br>
configuration modules 39 (using the configuration objects 42), which model the arrangement<br>
of physical entities and logical entities within the process plant 10. As seen in Fig. 3, the<br>
configuration display 64 includes a library or template section 65 (which includes the library<br>
40 of Fig. 2) and a configuration section 66. In one embodiment, the configuration<br>
application 38 may include a routine stored on the computer readable memory 35 and adapted<br>
to be executed on the processor 36 to present the'library or template section 65 (which<br>
includes the library 40 of Fig. 2) on the user interface or workstation 20; In addition, the<br>
configuration application 38 may include a routine siored on the computer readable memory<br>
35 and adapted to be executed on the processor 36 to present a configuration display or area<br>
64 on the1 user interface or workstation 20, such as that illustrated iaFig. 3,,to the<br>
configuration engineer (or other user).<br>
[0056] The library or template section 65 is adapted to present a graphical depiction of sets<br>
of template configuration objects 67, which may include the configuration objects 42 of Fig.<br>
2, to a user via the user interface or workstation 20. The template configuration object 67<br>
may be associated with any desired process entity such as, for example, a device object 67a<br>
representative of a device within the process plant 10, .a connection object 67b representative<br>
of a connector element within the process plant 10, a unit object 67c representative of a unit<br>
within'the process plant 10, and an area object 67d representative of an area of the process<br>
plant 10.<br>
[0057] Device objects 67a may be associated with physical devices within the plant 10 that<br>
perform some function with respect to a stream of material such as, for example, valves,<br>
sensors, transmitters, pumps, eductors, dampers, feeders, etc. Connection objects 67b define<br>
the manner in which.materials within the process plant 10 such as, for example, solid<br>
materials, liquid, vapor, electricity, and gases are delivered or carried from one device to<br>
another. More particularly, connection objects 67b may include pipes, ducts, conduits,<br>
conveyors, electrical cables, or any other device or entity that moves material from one point<br>
to another point within the process. Pipes are generally used to illustrate (and simulate)<br>
liquid and high pressure vapor or gas flow within the plant 10. Ducts are generally used to<br>
illustrate (and simulate) low pressure gas flow within the plant 10. Conveyors are generally<br>
usea to illustrate (and simulate) the movement of solid material between processing units.<br>
And electrical cables are used to illustrate (and simulate) power flow in electro-chemical<br>
processes, etc: Arrows may be displayed with these connection objects 67b to show the<br>
direction of the material flow.<br>
[0058] Each connection object 67b defines the type of connection that is used to provide<br>
material at the input or output of a device. In other words, a connection object 67b may begin<br>
at a device object 67a output or a unit object 67c output, and may terminate at a device object<br>
67a input or a unit object 67c input. In addition, if an upstream output is common to two<br>
connections, a "T" element may be included in the connection object 67b. Similarly, "T"<br>
elements may'be used to combine multiple outputs:<br>
[0059] In some cases, a particular type of device object 67a may only be used with a<br>
specific type of connection object 67b. For example, a pipe may be used with only a valve,<br>
pump, eductor, or feeder. Similarly, a duct object may be set up to be used with a draft fan or<br>
damper drive or other device that provides flow of gas. Likewise, a conveyor may be used,<br>
with only a feeder and a motor drive to simulate and depict the flow of solid materials.<br>
[0060] Unit objects 67c may include a logical grouping of device objects 67a and<br>
connection objects 67b interconnected together, as well as other plant equipment that process<br>
or perform a function on the materials or streams in the plant 10 in some manner. Generally,<br>
all inputs and outputs to and from unit objects 67c maybe made through connection objects<br>
67b. Standard unit objects 67c include tanks (vertical and horizontal), mixers, reactors, air<br>
heaters, heat exchangers, compressors, turbines, distillation columns, evaporators, separators,<br>
boilers, or any other elements that perform some type of simple or standard processing<br>
activity, as well as the various device objects 67a and connection objects 67b associated with<br>
these units. Similarly, area objects 67d may include a logical grouping of unit objects 67c;<br>
device objects 67a and connection objects 67b interconnected together, as well as other plant<br>
equipment that process or perform a function on the materials or streams in the plant 10 in<br>
some manner.<br>
[0061] Basically, the template configuration objects 67 are generic objects that may be<br>
provided from the system manufacturer to the user and that may be selected, dragged, and<br>
dropped onto the configuration section 66 to create an instance of a configuration object<br>
within a process configuration module 39. More particularly, to create a process<br>
configuration module 39, the configuration application 38 may include a routine stored on the<br>
computer readable memory 35 and adapted to be executed on the processor 36 that enables<br>
the configuration engineer (or some other user) to create the process configuration module 39<br>
by selecting one of the template configuration objects 67 from the library or template section<br>
65, dragging the selected template configuration object 67 to a desired location within the<br>
configuration section 66, and dropping or placing the selected template configuration object<br>
67 within the desired location on the configuration section 66.<br>
[0062] It is to be understood that the configuration engineer "selects" particular template<br>
configuration objects 67 in any conventional windowing manner such as, for example, by<br>
double-clicking on a template configuration object 67 with a mouse, by tapping or touching a<br>
particular template configuration object 67 on a touch-sensitive screen, or by entering a<br>
command on a keyboard.<br>
[0063] As will be discussed in greater detail below, the routine may enable the<br>
configuration engineer (or some other user) to store the configuration parameters of the<br>
selected template configuration object within the data store 53 to create the process<br>
configuration module 39. The routine may further enable the configuration engineer (or<br>
some other user) to store data indicative of a communication attribute associated with the<br>
physical entity. The communication attribute may include a communication protocol, a<br>
communication connection type, a number of communication inputs/outputs, and/or a type of<br>
communication connection input/output.<br>
{0064] The device objects 67 may be used to create higher-level configuration objects such<br>
as, for example, custom unit objects. Likewise, template unit objects maybe used to create<br>
even higher-level objects such as, for example, custom area objects, etc., for each level of the<br>
equipment and logical hierarchy of a process control system. All of the custom or userdefined<br>
higher-level configuration objects may be stored in the library 40 along with the<br>
predefined template configuration objects 42 and later reused or used as a starting point for<br>
the creation of other custom configuration objects, including other unit and area configuration<br>
objects.<br>
[0065] . Fig. 3 illustrates an example of a process configuration module 39 for a flow loop<br>
that may be created using the template configuration objects 67 and the configuration<br>
application 38 described above. As illustrated in Fig. 3, the configuration, engineer may<br>
create the process configuration module 39 by selecting, dragging, and dropping template<br>
device objects 67a, e.g., a valve 102 and a transmitter 104, onto the configuration section 66<br>
in a desired location. The configuration engineer may interconnect the valve 102 and<br>
transmitter 104 by selecting, dragging, and dropping a template connection object 67b, e.g., a<br>
pipe 106, between the valve 102 and the transmitter 104.<br>
[0066] Alternatively, a connection object may be created by holding the left mouse button<br>
down over an object output (such as, for example, a device object output or a unit object<br>
output) and, while holding down a button on the mouse, positioning the cursor over an object<br>
input (such as, for example, a device object input or a unit object input). For the connection<br>
to be established successfully, the input and the output types (pipe, duct, conveyor, etc.) of<br>
the upstream and downstream objects should match. The connection may automatically take<br>
on the type of the upstream object.<br>
[0067] After specifying the .configuration objects that make up' a particular process<br>
configuration module 39,. the configuration application 38 allows a configuration engineer to<br>
specify the attributes or properties associated with each process configuration module 39 (and<br>
the configuration objects 42 within the process configuration modules 39) using, for example,<br>
a pull-up menu, a pull-down menu, a pictographic menu, a dialog box, a pop-up menu, etc.<br>
associated with the configuration display 64. More particularly, each process configuration<br>
module 39 (and the configuration objects 42 within the process configuration module 39)<br>
may include physical or engineering attributes, control attributes, maintenance attributes, and<br>
management attributes.<br>
[0068] During configuration of the process plant 10, a configuration engineer may<br>
completely define the attributes, methods, etc. for each process configuration module 39 of<br>
the process control system, and store the configuration information or parameters (e.g., the<br>
physical or engineering attributes, the communication attributes, the control attributes, the<br>
maintenance attributes, the process management information or business attributes, one or<br>
more display formats for displaying the device parameter information, etc.) in the data store<br>
53 . By specifying these different attributes for each process configuration module, the<br>
configuration activities formerly associated with the various different applications may be<br>
integrated into a single object usable by the various applications to provide various different<br>
views or types of information to different users.<br>
[0069] Physical or engineering attributes may include a, type, a size, a flow capacity, a<br>
volume,1 a surface area, a number of process input/output connections, a type of process<br>
input/output connections, a timing parameter, etc. associated with the actual physical object<br>
(such as a device, a unit, an area, etc.) being modeled by the process configuration module<br>
39. As an example, physical or engineering attributes associated with a valve object may<br>
include the valve type (e.g., linear, quick opening, equal percentage, etc.), the valve size, the<br>
stroke time from open to close, the valve manufacturer and part number, the type of material<br>
flowing through the valve, and an indication of one or more engineering applications or tools<br>
that may access and use the device parameter information and/or configuration parameters to<br>
perform a data processing function with respect to the physical entity associated with the<br>
process configuration module and to produce process information related to the physical<br>
entity.<br>
[0070] Control attributes may include a control strategy or routine, (including the function<br>
blocks that make up the control strategy), a type of control strategy or routine used to control<br>
the physical entity, values for one or more control parameters associated with control of the<br>
physical entity, references to the electrical inputs and outputs of the function blocks<br>
associated with the control strategy, setpoints, the initial values of the attributes, the default<br>
values (if appropriate) of the attributes, the range, i.e., high and low values, of the attributes,<br>
measurement units, limits, dead band, etc. The plurality of template configuration objects 67<br>
may also include a simulation algorithm adapted to simulate operation of any entity within<br>
the process plant 10. As an example, a configuration engineer might create a control strategy<br>
for a tank unit object in which a fluid level in a tank is read by a level sensor, and compared<br>
with a predetermined desired level. The control strategy may then open or close a feed valve<br>
based on whether the fluid level is lower or higher than the predetermined desired level. The<br>
simulation algorithm may simulate the fluid level of .the tank unit object, as read by the level<br>
sensor, and display an indication of the sensed fluid level on the display device 37.<br>
[0071] Control attributes associated with a valve object may include the control strategy<br>
such as, for example, the function blocks, that are used to define and access a particular<br>
function to control the valve. A configuration engineer may associate the electrical inputs<br>
and outputs of the function blocks (i.e., AI, AO, DI, DO, etc.) with electrical signals or values<br>
produced or generated by various configuration objects (e.g., device objects 67a or unit<br>
objects 67b) that make up the process configuration module 39. In this manner, the<br>
configuration application 38 relates each of the functions defined by the function blocks<br>
according to the interconnections of the objects within the process configuration module 39<br>
specified by the configuration engineer.<br>
[0072] It is to be understood that each of the control function blocks (e.g., PID, MFC,<br>
fuzzy logic, neural network, etc.) in a control strategy includes an algorithm for performing a<br>
i<br>
particular function and fixed parameters upon which the algorithm may operate to use the<br>
electrical inputs and outputs to provide the desired process control function. Thus, a<br>
configuration engineer may specify the parameters such as, for example, the setpoint, mode,<br>
status, etc. of the associated function block controlling that valve when setting or configuring<br>
a valve object, either by itself or as part of a higher-level process configuration module, such<br>
as a unit object, an area object, etc.<br>
[0073] Other control attributes that may be associated with or specified for the process<br>
configuration module 39 by a configuration engineer include an indication of one or more<br>
control diagnostic applications or tools (e.g., DeltaV Inspect, RTO+, process control<br>
applications, control optimizer applications, process optimizer applications, modeling tools,<br>
expert applications, tuning routines, etc.) that may access and use the device parameter<br>
information and/or configuration parameters associated with the process configuration<br>
module to perform diagnostics with respect to controlling the physical entity and to produce<br>
process information related to the physical entity. In this manner, the various applications or<br>
tools are configured when the interconnections and interrelationships of the objects within<br>
each process configuration module are specified.<br>

2003/0028268 entitled "Data Sharing in a Process Plant" (filed Mar. 1,2002), both of which<br>
are hereby expressly incorporated by reference herein.<br>
[0075] In addition, control attributes may further include an indication of one or more<br>
alarm applications related to alarms and how alarms generated by the process configuration<br>
module 39 (and configuration objects within the process configuration module 39) are<br>
managed. For example, one or more alarm applications may be related to specifying the<br>
criticality of alarms. Control attributes may further include trending applications associated<br>
with the process configuration module 39 (and the configuration objects 42 within the<br>
process configuration module 39). Examples of applications or systems related to alarms are<br>
disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,768,119 entitled "Process Control System Including Alarm<br>
Priority Adjustment" (filed Apr. 12, 1996), U.S. Patent Pub. No. 2002/0055790 entitled<br>

[0076J Maintenance attributes may include information associated with operation of the<br>
physical entity that may be used by maintenance pers6ns such as, for example, alarm<br>
configuration information (e.g., how alarms are to be setup, displayed and treated), device .<br>
health information (e.g., the manner of displaying device health information), maintenance<br>
diagnostics information, an indication of one or more maintenance applications (e.g., device<br>
diagnostics applications, equipment maintenance applications and root cause applications)<br>
that may access and use the device parameter information and/or configuration parameters to<br>
perform maintenance-related data processing function with respect to the physical entity<br>
associated with the process configuration module and to produce process information related<br>
to the physical entity. Of course, maintenance attributes may include an indication of and '<br>
configurations for any other maintenance-related data to provide access to such data and the<br>
manner of processing or viewing such data.<br>
[0077] hi a similar manner, business or process management attributes may include an<br>
indication of one or more applications that may access and use the device parameter<br>
information and/or configuration parameters associated with the process configuration<br>
module to perform an appropriate data processing function (e.g., creating graphs), as well as<br>
to produce and provide process information that a manager needs to make decisions about<br>
what to produce, whether the plant is operating satisfactorily, etc.<br>
[0078] In addition, the process configuration module 39 may include simulation algorithms<br>
that calculate parameters associated with a device such as, for example, the discharge<br>
pressure, mass flow, liquid temperature, liquid composition, inlet pressure, outlet pressure,<br>
etc. of a valve. Of course, the simulation algorithms available to simulate the operation of a<br>
valve or the material flowing through the valve may be dependent upon the type of valve and<br>
sizing information, which were provided as engineering attributes. .As'discussed in further<br>
detail below, these simulated or calculated parameters may be exposed in a process operator's<br>
view, if so desired.<br>
[0079] A configuration engineer may also specify maintenance attributes associated with<br>
the valve object such as, for example, an indication of one or more applications (e.g., the<br>
AMS application, data analysis and diagnostic tools, control diagnostic applications, device<br>
diagnostic applications, index generation applications, performance tracking tools, root cause<br>
applications, plugged line detection applications, device status applications, equipment<br>
monitoring applications, power management and power equipment monitoring and analysis<br>
tools, etc.) that may access and use the device parameter information and/or configuration . parameters associated with the process configuration module to perform a data processing<br>
function with respect to the physical entity associated with the process configuration module<br>
and to produce process information related to the physical entity. Examples of applications<br>
or systems that are related to maintenance and/or diagnostics are disclosed in U.S. Patent No.<br>
6,094,600 entitled "System and Method for Managing a Transaction Database of Records of '<br>
Changes to Field Device Configurations" (filed Feb. 6,1996), U.S. Patent No. 6,298,454<br>
entitled "Diagnostics in a Process Control System" (filed Feb. 22,1999), U.S. Patent Pub.<br>
No. 2002/0038156 entitled "Root Cause Diagnostics" (filed Oct. 5,2001), U.S. Patent Pub.<br>

Process Plant" (filed Feb. 28,2002), and U.S. Patent Pub. No. 2003/0200060 entitled "On-<br>
Line Rotating Equipment Monitoring Device" (filed Apr. 22,2002), all of which are hereby<br>
expressly incorporated by reference herein.<br>
[0080] Likewise, a configuration engineer may specify the business or process<br>
management attributes associated with the process configuration module 39 such as, for<br>
example, a product type, a throughput, an efficiency, an uptime, a downtime, a yield, an<br>
indication of one or more applications (e.g., RTO+, enterprise resource planning applications,<br>
materials resource planning applications, plant management applications, process<br>
management applications, index generation applications, work order generation applications,<br>
etc.) that may access and use the device parameter information and/or configuration<br>
parameters associated with the process configuration module 39 to perform a data processing<br>
function with respect to the physical entity and to produce process information related to the<br>
physical entity. Examples of applications or systems that are related to business or<br>
management functions are disclosed in U.S. Patent Pub. No. 2002/0147506 entitled "Fiducial<br>
Technique for .Estimating and Using Degradation Levels in a Process Plant" (filed Feb. 28,<br>
2002), and U.S. Patent Pub. No. 2002/0169514 entitled "Automatic Work Order/Parts Order<br>
Generation and Tracking" (filed Feb. 28,2002), both of which are hereby expressly<br>
incorporated by reference herein. As with the control attributes, the various applications<br>
specified with the maintenance and management attributes are configured when the<br>
interconnections and interrelationships"of th'e; objects; within' each process configuration<br>
module are specified.<br>
[0081] If desired, the configuration engineer may store a process configuration module 39<br>
in the configuration object library 40 as a custom or user-defined device object 67a to create a<br>
device process module representative of aiield device within the process plant 10.<br>
Additionally, the configuration engineer may store a process configuration module 39 in the<br>
configuration object library 40 as a unit object 67c such as, for example, a flow loop unit<br>
object 100 (illustrated in Fig. 3) to create a unit process module representative of a unit<br>
within the process plant 10. Still further, the configuration engineer may store a process<br>
configuration module 39 in the configuration object library 40 as a custom or user-defined<br>
area object 67d to create an area process module representative of an area within the process<br>
plant 10. Each of the custom or user-defined device, unit and area objects 67a, 67c and 67d<br>
may include their own data store 53, inputs 54, outputs 56 and methods 60 associated<br>
therewith. In this manner, the configuration engineer may access and reuse the flow loop unit<br>
object 100, for example, when configuring or creating other higher-level process<br>
configuration modules 39. Fig. 4 illustrates a manner in which different unit objects 100,<br>
110,112,114, and 116 may be connected together to form a higher-level unit object 120 to<br>
illustrate (or simulate) a portion of the process plant 10. As illustrated in Fig. 4, the unit<br>
object 120 is made by connecting the flow loop unit object 100 of Fig. 3, as well as other unit<br>
objects 110,112,114, and 116, which may be either predefined, template unit objects 67c<br>
(such as, for example, the template heat exchanger unit object 110) or custom, user-defined<br>
unit objects.<br>
[0082] To create the configuration object 120 of Fig. 4, a configuration engineer may<br>
connect the outputs of the input flow loop unitobjects 112 and 114 to inputs of the heat<br>
exchanger device object 110 using any desired drag-and-drop technique, any pull-down<br>
menus, etc. Similarly, the configuration engineer may connect the outputs of the heat<br>
exchanger device object 110 to the inputs of the output flow loop unit objects 100 and 116 in<br>
any desired manner. The configuration engineer may then store the created configuration<br>
object 120 in the configuration object library 40 as either a unitobject (sucfras a%eat<br>
exchanger unit object) or as part of an area object.<br>
[0083] Fig. 5 illustrates an example of the unit object 120 that may be created and stored in<br>
the library 40, using the display routine of Fig. 4 so that it may be accessed and used by the<br>
configuration engineer. Of course, the created unit object 120 includes its own data store 53,<br>
inputs 54, outputs 56, and methods 60. In addition, because the unit object 120 contains all<br>
of the attributes (e.g., engineering attributes, control attributes, maintenance attributes,<br>
management attributes, etc.) specified for the process configuration modules 39 of the lowerlevel<br>
device or unit objects, the configuration engineer does not need to specify the attributes<br>
associated with the unit objects (and device objects that make up the unit object). Instead, by<br>
building up the unit object 120 from other device and unit objects, the unit object 120 may<br>
automatically include and have access to all of the attributes stored for each of those objects,<br>
which the unit object 120 contains. Of course, additional attributes, including control,<br>
maintenance, management, etc. attributes maybe specified for the unit object 120 as a whole.<br>
[0084] Fig. 6 illustrates an example screen display 130 for an area object that may be<br>
created using lower-level process configuration modules 39 and the configuration application<br>
38 discussed above. The interconnected entities on the screen display 130 maybe configured<br>
by a configuration engineer using the configuration application 38 described above, and may<br>
be displayed on the display device 37 by the execution engine 48 during runtime of a process<br>
configuration module 39. Furthermore, each of the entities such as, for example, the tanks,<br>
How transmitters, valves, etc., as well as the connectors therebetween, depicted on the screen<br>
130 may be generated by or associated with configuration objects 42 within a process<br>
configuration module 39 and the graphical representations associated with the configuration<br>
objects. Still further, while the entities depicted on the screen display 130 include tanks,<br>
pumps, flow transmitters, valves, lines, etc., connected in a particular configuration, any other<br>
process entities, including hardware devices and software or logical elements such as control<br>
loops, control modules, function blocks, etc. may be depicted within the screen display 130 in<br>
any desired configuration.<br>
[0085] During execution of a process configuration module 39 by the execution engine 48,<br>
the engine 48 implements the communications defined by the inputs_54 and outputs 56 to<br>
each of the configuration objects in the process configuration module 39, and may implement<br>
the methods 60 for each of those objects to perform the functionality provided by the<br>
methods 60. As noted above, the functionality of the methods 60 may be located in<br>
programming within the configuration object, or defined by a set of rules within the rules<br>
database 50 that the engine 48 executes based on the type, class, identification, tag name, etc.<br>
of a configuration object to implement the functionality defined ,by those rules.<br>
[0086] It should be noted that an instance of the configuration object has a tag or unique<br>
name within the context of the process configuration module 39 with which the configuration<br>
object is associated. This tag or unique name may be used to provide communications to and<br>
from the configuration object, and may be referenced by the execution engine 48 during<br>
runtime. Process configuration module tags may be unique within the process control system<br>
configuration. This tagging convention enables elements within the process configuration<br>
modules 39 to be referenced by elements within others of the process configuration modules<br>
39.<br>
[0087] Still further, the parameters of the configuration object may be simple parameters<br>
such as simple values, structured parameters, or parameters that know the expected units and<br>
attributes associated therewith. Smart parameters may be interpreted and used by the process<br>
rules engine or execution engine 48 to assure that all signals are being sent in the same units,<br>
or are converted properly. Smart rules may also be used to rum on and turn off groups of<br>
alarms for the configuration objects (or process configuration modules 39) to create a smart<br>
alarm strategy and/or interface for the operator. Still further, configuration object classes<br>
maybe associated with equipment and module classes within the process control strategy of<br>
the plant 10 to provide a known linkage between a configuration object and the process<br>
.variables it will need to interpret or access.<br>
[0088] Configuration objects, when used in process configuration modules 39, may also<br>
include mode of operation, status, and alarm behavior so that these configuration objects may<br>
.<br>
be put in different modes during runtime such as, for example, off, start-up, and normal<br>
modes, may provide a status associated with the object based on its current operating state,<br>
-and may provide alarms based on detected conditions such as, for example, a parameter out<br>
of range, limited, high variability, etc. Configuration objects may also have a class/subclass<br>
hierarchy, which enables them to be categorized in class libraries, to be collected together in<br>
a composite structure, etc. Still further, configuration objects may use information from other<br>
elements such as, for example, process configuration modules 39 and other objects to enable<br>
the configuration object to recognize when its associated entity is busy or, for example.<br>
acquired by a batch control process within the process plant 10. ,<br>
[0089] Configuration objects that are associated with connectors, sometimes referred to<br>
herein as smart links or connection objects, are also tagged (even though the actual device or<br>
connector-itself may not-be-tagged-or-able to communicate within the process plant 10) and<br>
are generally used to represent material flow between other elements in the process. Smart<br>
links will typically include properties or parameters that define how different materials or<br>
phenomena (such as electricity) flow through the connection (e.g. steam, electricity, water,<br>
sewage, etc). These parameters may indicate the type and nature of flow (such as the general<br>
speed, friction coefficients, type of flow such as turbulent or nonturbulent, electromagnetic,<br>
etc.) through the connector and the possible direction or directions of flow through the<br>
connector. Smart links may include programming or methods that ensure that the units of the<br>
source and destination object to which the smart link connects, match and, if not, may<br>
perform a conversion. The methods of the smart link may also model the flow through the<br>
connector using a model or an algorithm to estimate the speed or nature of the flow through<br>
the actual connectors, length and size of the physical connections, transport delay, etc. The<br>
stored parameters for the configuration object (such as friction parameters) may be used in<br>
these methods.' Thus, the smart links or connection objects enable configuration objects to be<br>
aware of the other upstream and downstream objects or entities.<br>
[0090] Of course, smart links may, for example, define the connections between other<br>
objects, the type of fluid, such as liquid, gas, electricity, etc. within the system, the upstream<br>
and downstream side of the entities, which other entities are upstream and downstream of the<br>
entity for this configuration object, the direction of material, fluid, electric flow, etc. in any<br>
desired o'r convenient manner.<br>
In one embodiment, the connection matrix 52 maybe created prior-to execution-of<br>
the process configuration modules 39, and may define for the smart links the interconnections<br>
between the different devices within the process plant 10 and, therefore, the interconnections<br>
between the different configuration objects, hi fact, the execution engine 48 may use the<br>
matrix 52 to ascertain the upstream and downstream entities, and thereby define the<br>
communications between the configuration objects and the methods associated with the<br>
configuration objects. Still further, one or more set of rules may be provided to be used by<br>
the configuration objects to interact with each other, to obtain data from each other as needed<br>
for the methods within the configuration objects, and to resolve the impact of configuration<br>
objects associated with output connections.<br>
[0092] If desired, the configuration object may also include hot links, such as URLs, to key.<br>
documentation which may be applicable to the type of object, or which may be specific to the<br>
instance (depending on the criticality and application) of the device to which the<br>
configuration object pertains. The documentation may be vendor supplied, as well as user<br>
specific. Some examples of documentation include configuration, start-up and shut-down<br>
procedures, operational and maintenance documentation, etc. If desired, an operator may<br>
click on the object as displayed in an operator display to bring up the instance specific (if<br>
any) and generic documentation for the object or associated device. Also, the operator may<br>
be able to add/delete/change documentation independently of the system software such as, for<br>
example, maintenance requests, records of operational problems, etc. Furthermore, these hot<br>
links may be user configurable or changeable to provide the ability to add knowledge links to<br>
objects in the operator interface, to provide for quick navigation to appropriate information<br>
associated with the object, and to provide the ability to add work instructions specific to the<br>
customer, to the specific object type, or even to the specific instance of the object.<br>
(0093] Once the configuration engineer has completed the configuration of the process<br>
configuration modules 39 (and the configuration objects within the process configuration<br>
modules 39), which reflect the physical layout of devices and equipment within the process<br>
plant 10 using the configuration application 38, and once the process configuration modules<br>
39 (and associated configuration objects 42), as well as the plurality of applications 32<br>
implerriented iii the process control system, are communicatively coupled to the individual'<br>
process entities within the process plant 10, the execution engine 48 may execute or<br>
implement each of the process configuration modules 39. More specifically, the execution<br>
engine 48 may include a routine stored on the computer readable memory 35 and adapted to<br>
be executed on the processor 36 that executes or implements each of the process<br>
configuration modules 39 during runtime to obtain device parameter information from the<br>
process plant 10 pertaining to the entity associated with the process configuration module 39<br>
and to make the obtained device parameter information and the process information produced<br>
by the various applications available to the user via the user interfaces or workstations 20 and<br>
22 in conjunction with the graphical representation of the entity. More specifically, the<br>
routine may display the device parameter information on the user interfaces or workstations<br>
20 and 22 according to one or more display formats specified during configuration'of the<br>
process plant 10.<br>
[0094] The device parameter information and the process information produced by the<br>
various applications may be made available to or presented on the user interfaces or<br>
workstations 20 and 22 by creating one or more process displays or views for a user as<br>
defined by the graphic displays 41 and the display format. The graphic displays 41 created<br>
by execution of the process configuration modules 39 are designed to dynamically show<br>
online measurements and actuators that interface with the process control system. In<br>
addition, unmeasured parameters, which reflect process operation, maybe calculated using<br>
online process simulation provided in the process configuration, modules 39 and maybe<br>
shown as an integral part of the associated graphic displays.<br>
[0095] .As noted above, the user may, as part of the process configuration module 39<br>
creation or configuration process, attach or provide process flow algorithms 45 to the process<br>
configuration module 39. These process flow algorithms 45 may be preconfigured to<br>
calculate or determine certain process or system-level properties such as, for example, mass<br>
balance calculations, flow calculations, efficiency calculations, economic calculations, etc.<br>
with respect to the process depicted or modeled by the process configuration module 39. As<br>
a result, the process configuration modules 39 themselves may have mode, status, and alarm<br>
behavior, may be assigned to workstations, and may be downloaded, as part of the display<br>
downloads.<br>
[0096] If desired, the flow algorithms may be executed by a separate or different execution<br>
engine or by the execution engine 48 to perform mass or heat balancing, flow routing, flow<br>
efficiency, flow optimization, economic calculations related to flow, or other desired flow-'<br>
related calculations using the data provided in the process objects of the process flow module<br>
39. Still further, these flow algorithms 45 may access parameters from the control strategy<br>
and may, conversely, provide data or information to the control strategy.<br>
[0097] As explained above, the process configuration modules'39 are constructed or built<br>
by building graphic displays 41 for these modules 39, and then by specifying flow algorithms<br>
45 to be used in or associated with these process configuration modules 39. Of course,<br>
individual process configuration modules 39 may be spread across and executed by different<br>
computers, and process configuration modules 39 maybe communicatively coupled to one<br>
another to operate in conjunction with each other, either on the same or on different<br>
computers.<br>
[0098] It will be understood that the process configuration modules may be built up and<br>
interconnected as described above to create a model of the physical and logical layout of the<br>
process control system in a manner such that the configuration, control, and display activities<br>
may be integrated. Advantageously, these process configuration modules may be used by<br>
different applications to obtain information from the process plant 10 and to create different<br>
views or display formats for use by different users to provide different types of information to<br>
those different users.<br>
[0099] In particular, while in the past, different applications such as maintenance,<br>
optimizer, control, business, etc. applications each had to be set up and configured separately,<br>
these applications may now be communicatively coupled to the process configuration<br>
modules as created above without the need to configure each of the applications separately.<br>
In fact, the process configuration modules, once created for a process plant, may be accessed<br>
by any application to enable the application to obtain the device parameter information,<br>
configuration parameters, online data, etc. that the application needs to operate and to<br>
perform the various data processing functions (e.g., the maintenance, control, business,<br>
optimizer, etc. functions), as well 'as to produce process information.<br>
[0100] Thus, once the process configuration modules are created for a'process plant,<br>
additional, separate configuration activities need not generally be performed because all of<br>
the process plant supporting applications, such as business, maintenance, optimizer and<br>
control applications, may be communicatively coupled to the appropriate process<br>
i<br>
configuration modules to obtain the information (e.g., configuration parameters and/or device<br>
parameter information) these applications need from the process plant. This information may<br>
be obtained from the appropriate process configuration modules because all of the process<br>
plant information flows through the process configuration modules. Additionally, the process<br>
configuration modules (because they include the engineering, maintenance, control and<br>
management attributes) may include an indication of or use one or more supporting<br>
applications to create or enable a display or view to be created. The display or view created<br>
by the process configuration modules may provide different types of information to different<br>
users by using the device parameter information and/or the configuration parameters.<br>
[0101] Fig. 7 illustrates a manner in which supporting applications, including the plurality<br>
of applications 32, may access data from and provide data to the process configuration<br>
modules 39 as they are being executed on the execution engine 48. In particular,<br>
maintenance system applications 200, optimizer applications 202, expert system or predictive<br>
control applications 204, and equipment monitoring applications 206, as well as any desired<br>
business applications 208 are communicatively coupled to the process'configuration modules<br>
39 and may obtain any desired information from these process configuration modules 39 for<br>
any desired purposes. Of course, the applications 200-208 may communicate with the<br>
process configuration modules 39 (as they are being executed in the execution engine 48)<br>
using the tags associated with the process configuration modules 39. As a result, whenever<br>
one of the applications 200-208 is executed, it may obtain the information it needs from the<br>
process configuration modules 39 as already set up, instead of having to be configured<br>
separately to identify where the application needs to go (within the process plant 10) to<br>
access or obtain the information it needs.<br>
[0102] Additionally, because the process configuration modules 39 are configured to<br>
include engine'eTing;Trfaintehance, control and management attributes, these process<br>
configuration modules 39. may automatically refer to specific ones of the applications 200-<br>
208, or specific information provided by these applications 200-208 which are relevant to<br>
these different activities. As a result, the user interface routines 35 may create different user<br>
displays or views for different users (e.g., business persons, maintenance persons, control<br>
operators, etc.) automatically from the process configuration modules 39. In particular, the<br>
user interface routines 35 may use the graphic displays 41 associated with the process<br>
configuration modules 39, the attributes specified for the process configuration modules 39,<br>
and one or more display formats to enable users to view different types of information about<br>
any portion of the process plant 10.<br>
[0103] For example, Figs. 8-10 illustrate different views for the unit object 120 illustrated<br>
in Figs. 4 and 5 that may be created by the user interface routines 35 using information<br>
provided by the process configuration module 39 for that unit object 120. In particular, a<br>
different graphical view may be provided for each of the process operators, maintenance<br>
persons, plant managers or supervisors, and the like to enable these different users to view a<br>
particular portion of the process plant 10 in terms relevant to their responsibilities.<br>
[0104] Fig. 8 illustrates an example of an operator's display for the unit object 120 of Figs.<br>
4 and 5. Of course, it should be recognized that although a unit object 120'for the heat<br>
exchanger portion is depicted within the operator's display shown in Fig. 8, any other portion<br>
ofMe plant 10 such as, for example, a loop, device, area, etc. may be shown instead to<br>
achieve the same or similar results. In particular, the operator's display illustrates the basic<br>
graphic (established during the creation of the unit object 120) graphically depicting this unit<br>
as including two input flow control units (made up of valves, transmitters, etc.) and two<br>
output flow control units (made up of valves, transmitters, and other devices) connected to a<br>
heat exchanger. The operator's display of Fig. 8 may also include control-related information<br>
300 that may be needed by the control operator to understand what is happening within the<br>
process. For example, flows, measured sensor values' (such as pressures, temperatures, etc.),<br>
and other typical control information 300 may be illustrated to the operator next to the<br>
depiction of the device or area in the unit object 120 to which these values apply. These <br>
values may be online values either measured by the actual devices within the process plant 10<br>
or developed by devices such as field devices, control routines, etc. during operation of the<br>
process plant 10 and provided to the process configuration module 39 during execution of the<br>
process configuration module 39.<br>
[0105] In particular, the process configuration modules 39 and configuration objects that<br>
make up the process configuration modules 39 are communicatively tied to, and obtain data<br>
from the different devices with which they are associated and may display this data on the<br>
operator's view. Thus, the configuration object for a pump within the graphic of Fig. 8 may<br>
be aware that it is connected to the flow transmitter, and may receive data From the<br>
configuration object for this entity. The configuration object for the flow transmitter may<br>
obtain the readings of the flow through the actual device as measured by the device in the<br>
process plant 10. A method associated with the configuration object for the pump may<br>
receive the data from the configuration object for the flow transmitter, and determine the<br>
variability of the flow as measured by the flow transmitter and this information may be<br>
displayed on the operator's display. If desired, a method associated with the configuration<br>
object for the flow transmitter may determine the variability of that transmitter, or an<br>
application within the transmitter itself may determine the transmitter variability, and provide<br>
this determination as data to the configuration object for the transmitter.<br>
-35-<br>
[0106] Additionally, as illustrated in Fig. 8, the operator's display may include an alarm<br>
banner 305 illustrating one or more pending alarms that have been received for any of the<br>
devices or elements depicted in or associated with the unit object 120. The specifics of the<br>
alarm banner 305, or the application which produces it, may-be specified as a control attribute<br>
for the unit object 120. Each of the alarms within the alarm banner 305 may be represented<br>
using an alphanumeric indicator that is uniquely associated with the devices or elements that<br>
generated the alarm. In the example display of Fig. 8, there is a control alarm (associated<br>
with the control loop PIC-101) and a pump alarm (associated with the PUMP-120 device)<br>
depicted in the alarm banner 305. Of course, as is normal in alarm display applications, each<br>
of the alarms within the alarm banner 305 may also include an information button 310, which<br>
may be selected by the operatorTo'view'more information relating to that particular alarm, to<br>
turn off or acknowledge the alarm, etc.<br>
{0107] As also illustrated in Fig. 8, information from one or more relevant control<br>
applications, such as control diagnostics applications, may be provided on the operator's<br>
display. For example, a diagnostic graphic 330 entitled DeltaV Inspect illustrates the number<br>
1<br>
of control modules (associated with the control routines used in the unit object 120) that are<br>
in the incorrect mode, that are in limited control, that have uncertain input and large<br>
variability. Furthermore a diagnostic graph may indicate the number of assets being<br>
monitored .(in this case 211) and of that number, how many have failed, need maintenance or<br>
some other attention soon, have an advisory condition, or are no longer communicating. It<br>
will be noted that this graphic 330 may be generated by, or the information within this<br>
graphic 330 may be obtained or generated by a control diagnostic application, which may be<br>
one of the applications 200-208 of Fig. 7. In addition, this information may be provided to<br>
the user interface routines 35 as part of the operator's display because this information may be<br>
referenced as an attribute by the appropriate process configuration module 39. Thus, the<br>
operator's display may be configured to obtain this information automatically from the<br>
appropriate applications 200-208 either separately, or because this information is referred to<br>
as a control attribute within the unit object 120.<br>
 [0108] As illustrated in Fig. 8, a production level graph 340 may also be provided on the<br>
operator's display. Again, the production level graph 340 may be generated by one of the<br>
applications 200-208 and provided automatically as part of the operator's display in the same<br>
, manner as the.diagnostic graph 330. It will be understood that the operator viewing the.<br>
display of Fig. 8 may select any of the elements thereofto obtain more detailed information<br>
pertaining to that element. For example, the operator may select any of the physical elements<br>
depicted in the display of Fig. 8 to drill down into that element to obtain more information<br>
about that element. For example, selecting a valve on the display of Fig. 8 may call up the<br>
display for the valve enabling the operator to .view detailed device status and performance<br>
information only about the valve, including .alarm information for the valve, the diagnostic<br>
displays configured for the valve (which may be the same as or different than the diagnostic<br>
or other displays illustrated for the unit object 120 in which the valve is located). Similarly,<br>
the operator may select one of the graphs 330,340 on the operator's display to pull up or<br>
obtain more information or even to access the application that generated that graph 330, 340.<br>
Additionally,, the operator may select displayed information to, for example, determine the<br>
origin of that information, or to determine other data related to the displayed information.<br>
[0109] While the operator may drill down into physical elements on the display to obtain<br>
information about those elements, the operator may also go to a higher level, such as to the<br>
area in which the unit object 120 is located to view information about that area, hi this<br>
manner, the operator may obtain access to wider or narrower portions of the process plant 10<br>
to thereby browse around or view control information about these wider or narrower portions<br>
of the process plant 10. Additionally, the operator, by drilling down into different portions of<br>
a process plant 10, may view the control information 300 related to these different portions of<br>
the process plant 10. Still further, it will be understood that, if desired, the information<br>
displayed on the operator's view may be limited or specific to the portion of the process plant<br>
10 depicted on the view. Thus, for example, the graphs 330 and 340 and other information<br>
created by supporting applications 200-208 and placed on the operator's display may be<br>
limited to including data associated with the devices depicted on the operator's display. In<br>
this manner, the operator may select the scope of information he or she wishes to see based<br>
on the physical portion of the process plant 10 depicted in the operator's display.<br>
[0110] Thus, as will be understood, the operator (or other user) may move or browse to<br>
different portions of the process plant 10 based on the graphical depiction of the process plant<br>
10 on the display, and thereby view the configuration and control information 300 associated<br>
with those different portions of the process plant 10 without the need for navigational tree<br>
structures, as is currently used by most process pi ant. applications, such as control and<br>
maintenance applications. In other words, the operator (or other user) may select the amount<br>
of data and the area of the process plant 10 for which he ;or she wishes to see data by<br>
browsing to the appropriate graphical depiction of that section of the plant 10, instead of by<br>
moving through a navigational tree structure.<br>
[0111 ] In a manner similar to the operator's display of Fig. 8, the user interface routines 35<br>
may create a maintenance display for maintenance persons to enable maintenance persons to<br>
view the information in which they are most interested. For example, maintenance persons,<br>
who .are primarily responsible for assuring" that the actual devices and equipment within the<br>
process are operating efficiently, and for repairing and replacing'malfunctioning equipment<br>
are typically concerned with and view information about the operating states of the devices<br>
and equipment within the process 10.<br>
10112] Fig. 9 illustrates an example of a maintenance display in which a maintenance<br>
person may view device-specific information about devices and equipment within the plant<br>
10. As will be seen, the maintenance display of Fig. 9 is associated with the unit object 120<br>
of Figs. 4 and 5, and includes the same graphic display of the physical elements associated<br>
with the unit object 120, as depicted in the operator's display of Fig. 8. As indicated above,<br>
this maintenance display may be created by or associated with the process configuration<br>
module 39 for the unit object 120. However, instead of control-related information 300,<br>
device maintenance information (which may be obtained by the process configuration<br>
module 39 for the unit object 120) is displayed at relevant locations of the maintenance<br>
display. For example, status or health information for devices may be displayed in the form<br>
of graphic meters or gauges 400 (i.e., the partially-shaded, semi-circular features) illustrating,<br>
for example, green (good) and red (bad). This health information may be measured or<br>
determined by the devices themselves (which is currently available with some devices sold<br>
by Emerson Process Management) or may be determined by one or more other applications,<br>
such as, for example, one of the maintenance applications 200 of Fig. 7. Health information<br>
for the unit, the area, and the plant may be a weighted aggregation of all the health<br>
information below the respected plant hierarchy. In any event, as illustrated in Fig. 9, the<br>
graphic meters or gauges 400 indicate different levels of health for the different devices<br>
within the unit object 120 to provide the maintenance operator with an easy manner of<br>
determining the'status or health of the device. '<br>
10113] As can be appreciated from the maintenance display shown in Fig. 9, a user may<br>
quickly ascertain whether an area is performing properly and will continue to perform<br>
properly. Furthermore, a maintenance person or other user may also quickly identify those<br>
devices, units, etc. that may need attention and/or which may be causing a particular problem<br>
via the maintenance display. '<br>
I '! '<br>
[0114] Additionally, maintenance graphs 402:406 illustrating the operation of the unit<br>
object 120 are illustrated in the maintenance view to help a maintenance person or other user<br>
understand the current operation of this unit from a maintenance standpoint. Of course, these<br>
graphs 402-406 may be generated by one or more maintenance applications 200 (or other '<br>
applications if so desired), ari?Tmay be selected by a maintenance person (or other user) to<br>
obtain more access to these applications. Thus, for example, a maintenance person may<br>
select one of the graphs 402-406 to cause the application that generated the graph to change<br>
the parameters used to create the graph. Additionally, a maintenance person or other user<br>
may view other information about a device such as, for example, the unit object 120, via an<br>
asset portal application (which has a display 408 illustrated in Fig. 9) to obtain online<br>
information provided about that device from, for example, a maintenance database.<br>
[0115] Likewise, the maintenance display of Fig. 9 includes a maintenance alarm banner<br>
410 that illustrates the maintenance or device alarms currently active for the devices<br>
displayed within the maintenance display. In this case, maintenance alarms are active for a<br>
pump named PUMP-120, a valve controller named DVC-1800, and a flow transmitter named<br>
FT-110. Of course, the maintenance alarm banner 410 may be produced by an alarm display<br>
application that is referred to by the process configuration module 39 for the unit object 120<br>
as a maintenance attribute.<br>
[0] 16] It will be understood that a maintenance person (or other user) may browse to other<br>
areas, units, devices, etc. of the process plant 10 via the graphic display in the same manner<br>
that a control operator (or other user) does via the operator's display of Fig. 8. Likewise, a<br>
maintenance person (or other user) may access other or additional information provided by<br>
the maintenance applications by selecting one or more'of the maintenance graphs 402-406 for<br>
these applications and have these applications operate on the data or provide additional data<br>
or analysis associated with the devices currently depicted within the maintenance display.<br>
(<br>
[0117] Fig. 10 illustrates an example of a plant manager's display for the unit object 120 of<br>
Figs. 4 and 5. While using the same graphics for the physical devices as used by the operator<br>
and the maintenance displays of Figs. 8 and 9, respectively, the manager's display may<br>
provide other types of information about the unit object 120 relevant to a manager making<br>
decisions about what to manufacture, the current level of production versus the target level,<br>
the deviation cost information, etc. Of course, management graphs 502, 504 may be created<br>
by the business applications 208 of Fig. 7, and the information may be configured to be part<br>
of the manager's display as an attribute of the process configuration module for the unit<br>
object 120. Of course, a manager (or other user) may drill down or up in the graphic display<br>
of Fig. 10 in the same manner as described above with respect to the operator and<br>
maintenance displays of Figs. 8 and 9, respectively, to view and obtain additional or different<br>
information via the display from the same or other applications designed to produce this<br>
information.<br>
[0118] While the integrated configuration system is described herein using a unit object<br>
120 as an example, it will be understood that similar displays and configuration activities<br>
may be performed and generated for any other entity or level of entity within the process<br>
plant 10, including physical devices (such as field devices), units, areas, the entire plant 10, as<br>
Avell as for logical entities such as control entities. Still further, it will be understood that the<br>
process configuration modules 39, which are created only once, are created in such a manner<br>
fffat they may be accessed by other apph'cations 200-208 without the need to provide<br>
configuration information to those applications 200-208. Instead, all of the applications 200-<br>
208 may rely oh the process configuration modules 39 for a specification of the configuration<br>
of the process plant ] 0. Likewise, the process configuration modules 39 include control,<br>
maintenance, business, optimizer, etc. attributes to define the manner in which different<br>
control, maintenance, business, optimizer activities are to be performed, including the manner<br>
in which this data is to be displayed on a user interface such as, for example, the display<br>
device 37 to different types of users. Still further, because the process configuration modules<br>
39 include graphic displays depicting the devices and other entities associated therewith,<br>
including the manner in which these devices are interconnected, a user of anykind may .<br>
browse to obtain information about different parts of the process plant 10 by browsing to a<br>
graphic display associated with that section of the plant 10. Thus, a user may easily<br>
understand the data the user is viewing because this data is related to the physical portion of<br>
the plant 10 currently depicted in the graphic display' To view information about a different<br>
-portion-of the-process plant 10, the user only needs to navigate or browse to the display for<br>
that portion of the process plant 10, thus making finding information about a desired portion<br>
of the process plant 10 easier and more intuitive.<br>
[0119] While the integrated configuration system and the other applications described<br>
herein are preferably implemented in software, they may be implemented in hardware,<br>
firmware, etc., and may be implemented by any other processor associated with the process<br>
control system. Thus, the elements described herein may be implemented in a standard<br>
multi-purpose CPU or on specifically designed hardware or firmware such as an applicationspecific<br>
integrated circuit (ASIC) or other hard-wired device as desired. When implemented<br>
in software, the software routine may be stored in any computer readable memory such as on<br>
a magnetic disk, a laser disk (such as a DVD) or other storage medium, in a RAM or ROM of<br>
a computer or processor, in any database, etc. Likewise, this software may be delivered to a<br>
user or a process plant via any known or desired delivery method including, for example, on a<br>
computer readable disk or other transportable computer storage mechanism or over a<br>
communication channel such as a telephone line, the internet, etc. (which are viewed as being<br>
tritsame as or interchangeable with providing such software via a transportable storage<br>
medium).<br>
