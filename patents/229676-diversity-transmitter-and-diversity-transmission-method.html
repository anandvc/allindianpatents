TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
Diversity transmitter and diversity transmission method<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to diversity transmitters, and in particular to diversity transmitters for use in connection with mobile communication systems such as UMTS and the like. Also, the present invention relates to a corresponding diversity transmission method.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In connection with diversity transmitters, different concepts are being discussed. In general, so called open-loop concepts and closed-loop concepts can be distinguished, as it is for example outlined in the document "A Randomization Technique for Non-Orthogonal Space-Time Block Codes1- by the present inventor and his coauthor, presented on IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference, May 2001, Rhodes, Greece.<br>
A number of different such open-loop concepts have been proposed in 3rd generation partnership project 3GPP (and/or 3GPP2). For example, in the above mentioned document "A Randomization Technique for Non-Orthogonal Space-Time Block Codes" Applicants have presented the so   called ABBA concept in 3GPP2. Motorola has proposed a combination of STTD+OTD (Space-Time Transmit Diversity + Orthogonal Transmit Diversity), and recently in the TSG-RAN Working Group 1 meeting #15 in Berlin, Germany, August 22-August 25, 2000, Samsung proposed a 2xSTTD concept in the submitted document<br><br>
"New CPICH Transmission Scheme for 4-antenna transmit diversity".<br>
In the document "A Space-Time Coding Concept for a Multi-Element Transmitter", by the present inventor and his coauthors, presented in the Canadian Workshop on Information Theory, June 2001, Vancouver, Canada, Applicants proposed a so-called Trombi-concept. (US-patent application filed on March 28, 2001). Nokia's Trombi concept (to be explained later in some greater detail) is considered by the inventor to show currently the best performance. However, up to now the Trombi-concept was mainly implemented in connection with phase-hopping or phase sweeping arrangements. Phase-hopping and phase sweeping can be used also in the context of the present invention, but with the Trombi-method the transmission methods involving very high data rates in WCDMA downlink can be further enhanced.<br>
Further transmit diversity concepts have been considered in the OFDM literature (orthogonal frequency division multiplexing). For example, such concepts are discussed in the document "Spatial Transmit diversity techniques for broadband OFDM systems" by S. Kaiser, published in IEEE, 2000, page 1824-1828, (0-7803-6451-1/00).<br>
This proposed concept by Kaiser however requires interleaving over multiple frequencies for full benefit. (A similar approach being discussed in US-A-6157612). Moreover, according to the teaching of Kaiser, a symbol to be transmitted is distributed across several carriers, so that for combining the received multipath components, guard intervals are required in order to be able to correctly combine the transmitted (distributed) symbol parts at the receiving side<br><br>
Referring back to the above mentioned so-called Trombi concept the following was proposed. A time-varying/hopping phase (e.g. pseudo-random) is added to the dedicated channel of a given user at the output of STTD encoder (Space-Time Transmit Diversity) (or an encoder based on some other orthogonal or non-orthogonal concept, see e.g. the previous "Randomization technique .♦." paper) .<br>
In one solution with 4 antennas, antennas 2 and 4 are multiplied by a complex coefficient (constant for two space-time coded [successive] symbols) to result in the following received signal (note that the received signal r, the symbols S, the transmission channel transfer functions h and complex coefficients w are generally given in matrix notation)<br>
r„ = Sx (h} + w, (t)h2) - S'2 (/i3 + w2 {t)hA) r,: = S2 (A, 4- M&gt; (t)h2) + S; (h3 + w2 (t)h4)<br>
In a preferred arrangement, it is configured such thgtt wl(t) = -w2(t), with constant amplitude = 1. Phase changes according to a suitable pseudo-random sequence. For example, it can hop with phases 0, 180, 90, -90, (or with any other sequence) known [a priori] to the terminal (receiver). 8-PSK hopping appears to be sufficient to get achievable gains.<br>
Then, the terminal estimates the channels hi, ..., h4, for example using common channel pilots (or dedicated pilots) which do not need to apply phase dynamics (e.g. common channel measurements can be done as proposed by Samsung in the cited document). Alternatively, the terminal can measure the effective channels hl+w*h2 and h3-w*h4 only.<br><br>
By knowing the channels and the pseudo-random weights at the transmitter the intentional phase dynamics can be taken into account and then the detection reduces to conventional STTD decoding without any complexity increase.<br>
In essence, the dynamics of the phase-hopping should be a priori fixed or at least it should be known by the UE (e.g. by suitable signaling from the transmitter to the receiver). In some cases it may also be advantageous if the UE controls the phase-hopping sequence.. As such a control procedure is expected to be known to those skilled in the art, these details are supposed to be not needed to be explained here.<br>
With channel coding, providing time diversity, the concept has better performance in low Doppler channels than a two antenna STTD concept, as shown in the "Trombi paper". Phase-hopping diversity can be used also in a way such that the channel estimates are directly taken from a phase-hopping channel. In that case the hopping sequence can have only incremental changes, as otherwise the effective' channel is changing too rapidly to enable efficient channel estimation. However, in this case the receiver terminal (User Equipment UE in UMTS) does not necessarily need to know that phase-hopping is used at all.<br>
Therefore, in the aforementioned scheme, phase-hopping can weaken channel estimation performance by the abrupt phase hops, or the hops have to be quantized to many levels, to thereby approximate a phase-sweep.<br>
The Trombi concept is designed for sequential transmission, and the phase-hopping sequence is defined over multiple time instants, covering multiple space-time *•<br><br>
encoded blocks. In future communication systems the whole information frame may be transmitted in one or a few symbol intervals (e.g. if in a CDMA system essentially all downlink codes are allocated to one user at a time). In such an extreme case, only one or a few phase-hopping values can be incorporated to the transmission, and the benefits of the Trombi concept cannot be achieved.<br>
As an example, in "Draft Baseline Text for Physical Layer Portion of the lxEV Specification" 3GPP2 C.P9091 ver. 0.21, August 24,2000 (3GPP2 TSG-C working group III) the physical layer of the High Data Rate CDMA system is described. This . system uses Time Division Multiplexing in downlink and each user can be allocated only one slot, and the pilots are structured so that only one channel estimate can be obtained for this one slot.<br>

symbol matrix signals on at least one of said branches to an invertible linear transformation with'at least one fixed complex weight, the complex weight being different for at least two parallel channels.<br>
According to the present invention, this object is for example also achieved by a diversity transmission method, comprising the steps of inputting a symbol matrix for being processed, said processing comprising supplying columns of said symbol matrix to a plurality of at least two branches, each branch being supplied to a respective one of spatial channels for transmission, performing parallelization so as to provide within each branch at least two parallel channels allocated to a respective user, and subjecting the symbol matrix signals on at least one of said branches to an invertible linear transformation with at least one fixed complex weight, the complex weight being different for at least two parallel channels.<br>

-	there is provided a pre-diversification step/means performed after/arranged downstream inputting and performed before/arranged upstream processing, said pre-diversification step/means subjecting said inputted symbol sequence to a diversification, at least one diversified symbol sequence being subjected to said processing,<br>

Also, for example, said pre-diversification means / step subjects said input symbol to at least one of an orthogonal transmit diversity OTD processing, parallel transmission (in this case pre-diversification takes as an input e.g. 4 different symbols, performs serial to parallel conversion and transmits the 2 symbols in parallel simultaneously from<br><br>
two  antennas   or branches,   this  increasing  the data  rate by factor of two),   orthogonal space-time transmit diversity (STTD,   assuming arbitrary number of outputs) ,   a non-orthogonal  space-time transmit  diversity STTD processing (maintaining  the  rate at  1  or  increase  the  rate beyond  1, but  allowing  some self-interference) ,   delay  diversity  DD processing,   Trellis-Code processing,   Convolutional Code Processing or Turbo-Code processing,   said pre-diversification means  subjects  said input  symbol  to more than  one of  said processings,   said processings being performed in  concatenation.   So,   there  exists   a system in which  there  is  first  channel  coding,   e.g.   by  a Turbo/Convolutional  code,   the output  is   given to OTD,   S/P, STTD  or NO-STTD,   and there is  typically  interleaving after Turbo  coding.<br>
Thus,   by virtue  of the present  invention the  above mentioned' drawbacks  inherent  to  known prior  art arrangements   are  removed.<br>
In particular,   the following advantages   can be achieved;<br>
-	improvement   of performance with burst   transmission;<br>
-	no  interference with channel  estimation,<br>
-	simple to  implement  at  the transmitter,   as  no  semi-continuous  sweep  is  required,<br>
-	no  interleaving over multiple  frequencies  is required for full benefit,<br>
-	no  guard  intervals   are  required in order  to  be  able   to correctly combine  the  transmitted   (distributed)   symbol parts   at  the   receiving side.<br>
In particular,   one  embodiment  of  the present   invention achieves  to  obtain  similar effective received  channels   (eq. 1,   defined over  time)   even without making  use  of phase-hopping,   and  even  if  the  transmission  interval  is  very<br><br>
short and highly parallel burst transmission is used.  In another embodiment the invention achieves to randomize the correlations within a non-orthogonal space-time code even if the transmission interval is very short.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
In the following, the present invention will be described in greater detail with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which<br>
Fig. 1 shows a simplified block diagram of a basic configuration of a diversity transmitter according to the present invention and operating according to the basic diversity transmission method according to the present invention, and<br>
Fig. 2 shows a modification a simplified block diagram of a modified configuration of a diversity transmitter according to the present invention, including a pre-diversification<br>
means.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS<br>
In the diversity transmitter and method according to the present invention there are multiple parallel transmissions out of at least two spatial channels (which may be antennas or beams). Namely, basically there need to be at least two (logical) parallel channels (e.g. spreading codes) allocated to a given user (receiver), the parallel channels are transmitted out of at least two spatial channels such as transmit antennas (or beams), e.g. like in Trombi, at least two (preferably 8, according to Trombi results) of the parallel channels, transmitted out of at least one of said spatial channel (antenna) are weighted by<br><br>
multiplication with a fixed complex weight, the complex weight being different for at least two parallel channels.<br>
This will be explained in greater detail with reference to Fig. 1.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a diversity transmitter, i.e. a simplified block diagram of a basic configuration of a diversity transmitter according to the present invention. Transmissions out of antennas (representing an example of-spatial channels) Al, . .., Am are experiencing the influence of respective transmission channels al, ..., am before reception at a receiver. In general, a symbol b to be transmitted is processed at the transmitter, transmitted via the transmission channel(s) and received at the receiver, where it is subjected to a reception processing in order to reconstruct the initially transmitted symbol b. Reception processing involves channel estimation in order to compensate for the influence of the transmission channels. (Note that the symbol b as well as the transmission channels, i.e. channel impulse response a thereof, are in matrix notation).<br>
The diversity transmitter comprises a transmit symbol input means 1 for inputting the symbol b (symbol matrix or a sequence of symbol matrices) to be forwarded to a transmit processing means 2. The transmit processing means 2 in turn comprises supplying means 2a for supplying said symbol b to a plurality of at least two branches, each branch being supplied to a respective one of transmit antennas Al, . .., Am (i.e. spatial transmit channels) for transmission to a receiver. A parallelization means 2b is adapted to provide within each branch at least two parallel channels allocated to a respective user (i.e. receiver), and a weighting means 2c is adapted to multiply the symbol signals on at least<br><br>
one of said branches with a fixed complex weight, the complex weight being different for at least two parallel channels.<br>
In Fig. 1, the parallelization is performed in each of the shown two branches, while the weighting is effected only in the lower branch. Nevertheless, it may be performed in the upper branch instead of the lower branch or in both branches.<br>
The parallelization means 2b is adapted to perform a multicode transmission WCDMA such as for example Hadamard transformation by multiplying with a user and/or service specific spreading code matrix H, and the spreading code matrix may be antenna specific. In the illustrated example, however, the same spreading code matrix has been selected for each antenna or spatial channel. If a Hadamard transformation is applied for spreading, scrambling prior to outputting the processed symbols to the antennas is performed, while however, such scrambling and RF processing is omitted from the illustration for purposes of keeping the illustration simple.<br>
The received signal r at the receiver after multipath propagation over the channels al, a2 (am with m=2) is then<br>
r = aflb + a2Hdiag([cxp(j^{\.^ exPCM,)])£ + "	(2)<br>
where the diagonal matrix "diag" consists of the fixed complex weights of a weighting matrix W, and coefficients al, a2 refer to channel coefficients (i.e. the respective channel impulse response) between a given antenna and the terminal. H is the matrix of spreading codes, n represents a noise component, and b the vector/matrix of transmitted* symbols<br><br>
This basic embodiment may be concatenated with pre-diversification performed by a pre-diversification means 3 arranged downstream said input means 1 and upstream said transmit processing means 2.<br>
Fig. 2 shows an example of such a diversity transmitter, with the input means being omitted from the figure. The pre-diversification means 3, for example performing STTD or another diversity concept, is adapted to subject said inputted symbol matrix b to a diversification, each diversified symbol (vectors/sequences) bl, b2 being supplied to said processing means. As shown in the example in Fig. 2, a first diversified signal bl is supplied to a processing means 21, while a second diversified signal b2 is supplied to a processing means 22. Means 21 and 22 are illustrated as being identical to each other, while this is not required to be. They may differ in terms of the spreading matrix H used, the weighting matrix W used, and even in the number m of spatial channels (antennas or beams) used. In a multiuser CDMA system where at least one transmission applies said multicode transmission it is preferred that the means 21 and 22 are the same, but that different users select different codes from said spreading matrix- Then the different code-multiplexed users do not interfere with each other, if the matrix is orthogonal.<br>
When concatenating this with other transmission diversity concepts as shown in Fig. 2, one needs to define the symbols {b} differently. In particular, we can consider a case in which we have A   antennas, and in which two parallel transmissions (both transmitting from two antennas) are combined with Orthogonal Transmit Diversity (OTD), such that they have the same symbol sequences, but different<br><br>
antenna specific orthogonal spreading matrices HI and H2. Then one receives a signal<br>
r = alHlb + a2Hldiag([exp(J^	+ a3H2b +<br>
a4H2 diag([Qxp(JA) &gt;••-, exp(/ <pn n></pn>
...(3)<br>
with four subscripts 1, ..-4 for the channels as in the example there are m=4 transmission antennas, two subscripts 1, 2, for parallel (multi)codes HI, H2 in different transmission antenna branches (due to OTD). In this case they are preferably different submatrices of a Hadamard code matrix, and thereby orthogonal to each other, n again represents a noise component.<br>
In alternative concepts we have at least partly different symbols sequence/vectors bl and b2 transmitted from the two different antenna pairs. Then, the received signal is given<br>
by<br>
...
For example, the symbol vectors bl and b2 may represent two<br>
different information substreams (possibly after channel<br>
coding), formed with serial to parallel (S/P) conversion.<br>
Then, the transmission concept increases the data rate by a<br>
t<br>
factor  of  two.   If  the  spatial   channels   from the  transmit<br><br>
antennas to the receive antennas are sufficiently different we can have H1=H2 and still be able to detect the symbol streams bl and b2. In alternative embodiments, the symbol streams bl and b2 may each belong to different branches of the STTD (or any other space-time code, including Space-time spreading). As an example, with STTD, the bl=(cl c2) and b2=(-c2* cl*), where cl and c2 are the (complex) symbols forwarded to parallel transmission means. In this case these symbol sequences are separable (in fact, orthogonal) due the properties of the space-time code, and the matrices HI and H2 are preferably identical. Note that in this case the symbol rate remains at 1 since it takes two time intervals to transmit two symbols. However, the diversity order is doubled. The code matrices are preferably orthogonal, e.g. Hadamard codes, or rotated (scrambled) Hadamard codes, or nearly orthogonal, such as well known Gold codes. Any other orthogonal space-time code can be used.<br>
It is to be noted that the antenna specific parallel channels H, HI and H2 above can have an arbitrary spreading factor, and can be implemented in code domain (parallel codes), or with orthogonal carriers (frequencies).<br>
This can be combined with any other transmit diversity concept, when e.g. extending the number of transmit antennas further. One can concatenate delay diversity, non-orthogonal space-time codes, orthogonal space-time codes, space-time trellis codes, Turbo-coded transmit diversity and various others with the proposed concept. Also, if one does not have a sufficient number of parallel channels but a sufficient number of successive symbol intervals, one can still use phase hopping, as  the prior art proposes.<br><br>
The complex weights should be defined so  that consecutive coded bits or symbols see a different channel. In one example, the parallel channels apply phases with 0, 180, 90, -90 degree offsets. Preferably, we would have at least eight states (e.g. from PSK alphabet), such that the phase sequence visits all states once and such that the "path length" is maximized.<br>
One can apply the fixed phase coefficients also in analogy with the ABBA concept and/or randomized ABBA concept (RABBA) if there are at least three transmit paths, e.g. three different transmit antennas. This is then effected in the pre-diversification means 3. In this case a sequence of symbols is input to the ABBA code (e.g. as in Trombi) , each output of the ABBA code (columns of the ABBA, or some other non-orthogonal space-time code matrix) are directed to different transmit antennas, and the sequence in each different branch is subjected to multicode transmission, such that at least in one branch at least one code is subjected to a fixed phase rotation. Note, that this can be implemented also so that selected symbols in a given branch of the non-orthogonal code have a rotated signal constellation.<br>
It is assumed that there are four antennas, and that different columns of the ABBA code are transmitted out of antennas 1, ..., 4 in parallel with different K spreading (Walsh) codes (w_k) or carriers (e.g. vectors from the IFFT matrix in OFDM) . In this case the transmitted signal for a packet of 4*K (number 4 comes from the particular ABBA construction, where in this example the 2x2 matrices A and B both contain 2 symbols e.g. from QPSK alphabet, there is essentially the same symbol construction in STTD, described earlier) symbols are given by equation (4) below<br><br>
z<br><br>
WA    wkQxp(jOk)Ak<br><br>
(4)<br><br>
where matrices A and B are the elements of the so called ABBA matrix (ABBA can be replaced here by any other non-orthogonal block code, optimized for one of multiple receive antennas). Each parallel transmission, indexed by k, carries different ABBA symbol matrices, and the signals are transmitted out of antennas.<br>
In the aforementioned example several parallel ABBA transmissions have different complex weights modulating the output of at least one antenna (in the example in previous equation, two antennas).<br>
Thus, there is no time index in the complex phasors (phasors means the multiplication factor achieving the time-invariant phase shift). Note that the parallel Trombi-concept can be described also with eq. 4, when two (and only two) B and A matrices switch place (are exchanged).<br>
In terms of other conceivable embodiments it is clear that a similar approach can be used for any system with more than two antennas. Also, the number of antennas need not to be an even number as in the illustrated examples in Fig. 1 and 2, but may be arbitrary,.<br>
The parallel weighted channels can be transmitted to non-fixed beams which are defined for example by long-term feedback from the receiver or by receive measurements, or by both; or they can be transmitted to fixed beams.<br>
The complex weights do not need to have unit norm but may have a value differing from 1.<br><br>
The previous phase-hopping concept has been converted according to the present invention to a phase-modulation concept which is applicable e.g. to the parallel channels in HDR (High Data Rate) or to any high rate transmission concept in which a number of parallel channels are used with at least two transmit antennas.<br>
This proposed concept has the advantage that it avoids the previous time-variant phase-offset arrangements, thereby resulting in a simpler receiver implementation in the user equipment. The concept can be implemented at base band using different rotated symbol constellations in parallel channels prior signal spreading.<br>
The performance of the concept, when combined with STTD is similar as with Trornbi, when this is used in place of phase hopping.<br>
Best symbol error rate is likely to be obtained with ABBA based/type solution with fixed phase offsets (in the presence of at least 3 antennas/channels). In that case one may be able to use a very high rate channel code, and some ARQ solution for "good enough" performance (with ARQ the phase can change if the retransmission occurs well with the channel coherence time).<br>
With OFDM, the ABBA solution randomizes the interference across multiple antennas,  and typically requires that a simple (linear or nonlinear) interference cancellation concept is used in the receiver to mitigate to non-orthogonality of the space-time code. With parallel-Trombi, it is simpler, as the codes and symbols remain orthogonal. No such CDMA based system (HDR, HSDPA) without the space-time code component even for two transmit antennas<br><br>
achieving the advantages described herein before is presently known to the inventors. In any case it is beneficial then to use one of the parallel channels for channel estimation and fix the phase offset for the parallel channels a priori so that the receiver of the user equipment need not estimate the channel for each of the parallel channels separately. However, if the parallel channels have independent channel estimators, the proposed concept is backward compatible to such a'system. It is also possible that the transmitter can use the concept if it so desires and the receiver blindly detects this. Blind detection can be done for example by demodulating the signal using the proposed concept (fixed phase offset) and without using the proposed concept, and selecting the one that gives better performance (e.g. symbol reliabilities at the output of the decoder).<br>
It is likely that the performance increase will be the highest in indoor channels (7-9 dB's compared to single antenna transmission).<br>
In particular, it is to be noted that the parallelization means is adapted to achieve a multicode transmission (WCDMA, Wideband Code Divisional Multiple Access). In this case, the parallelization means uses a Hadamard transformation (Hadamard matrix) or a submatrix of a Hadamard matrix. Also, parallelization is then followed by scrambling processing prior to transmission out of the antennas. If no Hadamard matrix for prallelization is to be used, so-called Gold codes may be used instead, which alleviates the necessity for subsequent scrambling. With scrambling, however, better autocorrelation properties for the signal can be obtained to make use of RAKE diversity.<br><br>
Alternatively, the parallelization means may be adapted to perform an Inverse Fast Fourier Transformation IFFT (in connection with OFDM).<br>
Furthermore, it is pointed out that the weighting means are adapted to perform not only a simple multiplication but a linear transformation- To this end, the weighting matrix may preferably be a matrix of the kind such that the weighting matrix W is unitary, i.e. that when multiplied with its conjugate complex transposed matrix WH yields the identity matrix I having only values of "1" in its diagonal (WH * W = I) .<br>
Moreover, in case the pre-diversification means subject the symbol to a non-orthogonal space-time code, non-orthogonal space-time block codes such as ABBA, Randomized ABBA (RABBA), or Alamouti Code (STTD in WCDMA) are advantageously to be used.<br>
Also, the sequence of parallelization and weighting may be reversed, provided that the used signal processing is suitably modified. The symbols prior parallel transmission can be subjected to weighting or the parallel channels (modulated spreading codes) can the subjected to weighting.<br>
Thus, according to the present invention, the phases in (selected parallel channels) in m-1 out of m antennas are randomized by fixed complex weights so that destructive combination does not dominate. If n parallel channels are present due to parallelization, a n dimensional weighting matrix can be used, although a two-dimensional matrix could be sufficient. In an n dimensional matrix, some of the complex phases may be set to zero, in which case no weighting is imposed on that particular channel.<br><br>
It is to be noted that signals as described in this application are represented in matrix notation. Thus, the symbol and/or symbol sequence is to be understood to be in matrix notation. Those matrices are for example described in "Complex Space-Time Block Codes For Four Tx Antennas", 0. Tirkkonen, A. Hottinen, Globecom 2000, December 2000, San Francisco, US for orthogonal space-time codes with a different number of transmit antennas. (A single symbol would correspond to a sequence of a minimum sequence length, e.g. length one).<br>
Also, a receiver adapted to receive the signals transmitted according to the present invention will have to be provided in particular with a corresponding despreading functionality, adapted to perform the inverse operation as compared to the transmitting side. This inverse operation can be expressed by the subjecting the received signal to an inverse processing, represented by multiplying with the inverse matrices (H"1' W"1) . Apart therefrom, a receiver will comprise RF parts, a channel estimator, a symbol detector (e.g. based on maximum likelihood, maximum a posteriori, iterative interference cancellation principles), and multiplexer.<br>
Accordingly, as has been described herein above, the present invention concerns a diversity transmitter, comprising: transmit symbol input means (1) for inputting a symbol matrix (b) to be forwarded to a transmit processing means (2), said transmit processing means comprising supplying means (2a) for supplying said columns of said symbol matrix to a plurality of at least two branches, each branch being supplied to a respective one of spatial' channels (Al, ..., Am) for transmission to a receiver, a parallelization means (2b) adapted to provide within each branch at least two parallel channels allocated to a<br><br>
respective user, and weighting means (2c) adapted to subject the symbol matrix signals on at least one of said branches to an invertible linear transformation with a fixed complex weight, the complex weight being different for at least two parallel channels. The present invention also concerns a corresponding diversity transmission method.<br>
Although the present invention has been described herein above with reference to its preferred embodiments, it should be understood that numerous modifications may be made thereto without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. For example, the transmitter may be the mobile terminal, and the receiver the base station, or another mobile terminal. Furthermore, the spatial channel may include so called polarization diversity channels. Power control may be applied to the parallel channels separately or jointly. Some of the parallel channels may provide a different quality of service (e.g. BER) and have different channel" coding (error correction/error detection), and/or different relative transmit powers. Some of the transmit antennas may belong to different base stations in which case the invention can be used to provide macrodiversity or soft handoff. It is intended that all such modifications fall within the scope of the appended claims.<br>
