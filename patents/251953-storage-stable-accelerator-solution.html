				<td>STORAGE-STABLE ACCELERATOR SOLUTION<br>
The present invention relates to a storage-stable accelerator solution suitable<br>
for forming a redox system with peroxides. The invention further relates to a<br>
curing process employing this solution, and a polymerisation process using this<br>
solution, and cured or polymerised items obtainable by these processes.<br>
Redox systems can be applied for resin curing and polymerisation initiation.<br>
Conventional redox systems comprise an oxidising agent (e.g. a peroxide), a<br>
soluble transition metal ion as accelerator, and a reducing agent. The<br>
accelerator serves to increase the activity of the oxidising agent at lower<br>
temperatures and, consequently, to speed up the polymerisation and the curing<br>
rate.<br>
US 4,009,150 discloses a time-lapse free-radical polymerisable composition<br>
comprising (i) a polymerisable compound selected from ethylenically<br>
unsaturated monomers and reactive polymers, (ii) a peroxide initiator, (iii) a<br>
soluble organic reducing agent, (iv) iron or copper chelate, and (v) excess<br>
chelating agent, wherein the chelating agent is selected from (3-dicarbonyl<br>
compounds having an enol content of at least 4% and a dicarbonyl angle of not<br>
greater than 120° and [B-hydroxy nitrogen-heterocyclic fused aromatics in which<br>
the hydroxyl group is attached to a carbon beta to the nitrogen in the adjacent<br>
ring.<br>
This composition is said to be reactive at room temperature. The total<br>
composition therefore cannot be handled commercially as a preformed<br>
composition, but must be handled as a multipackage composition and not<br>
mixed together until it is ready for use.<br>
EP 0 094 160 discloses a process for the polymerisation of vinyl chloride in<br>
aqueous suspension with an organo-soluble free-radical-yielding initiator by<br>
having a metal chelate complex present in the reaction zone and progressively<br>
adding a reducing agent.<br><br>
2<br>
Disclosed metal complexes are Cu(dmgH)2, Ni(EDTA), Cu(bdm)2, Ni(TETA),<br>
Cu(TACTD), Co(bipy)3CI3, and Co(phen)3CI3.<br>
EP 1 211 263 discloses a metal promoter complex consisting of at least one<br>
soluble metal salt and at least one chelating agent having less than 6 metal<br>
coordinating groups. In a polymerisation process, this metal promoter complex<br>
is added to a monomer mixture. Subsequently, oxidant and reductant are added<br>
to said monomer mixture in separate streams.<br>
US 4,446,246 discloses a method for curing a peroxide-curable ethylenically<br>
unsaturated compound using a peroxide initiator, a Cu+ activator, and optionally<br>
a reducing agent.<br>
WO 05/047364 discloses a pre-accelerated polyester resin or vinyl ester resin<br>
composition that is curable with liquid peroxide, containing an ascorbic acid<br>
compound and a soluble iron-containing complex. The composition is free of<br>
cobalt.<br>
In all these prior art processes and compositions the peroxide, the reducing<br>
agent, and the metal salt accelerator are added to the monomer mixture or the<br>
curable resin as three separate streams. The reducing agent is not mixed with<br>
the metal salt prior to use, because this would result in reduction and<br>
precipitation of the metal.<br>
It has now surprisingly been found that storage-stable accelerator solutions can<br>
be prepared which contain both the reducing agent and the accelerator metal<br>
salt.<br>
The present invention relates to such an accelerator solution, which consists<br>
essentially of:<br><br>
3<br>
a)	more than 1.0 wt% of one or more reducing agents, at least one of them<br>
being selected from ascorbic acid and sodium formaldehyde sulphoxylate,<br>
b)	one or more metal salts, at least one of them being selected from the group<br>
consisting of transition metal salts, lithium salts, and magnesium salts,<br>
c)	one or more organic oxygen-containing solvents,<br>
d)	optionally one or more stabilisers, and<br>
e)	optionally water.<br>
The fact that the accelerator solution according to the present invention<br>
"consists essentially of the indicated components, means that the solution does<br>
not contain any other compounds, except for trace amounts that have no<br>
material effect on the performance of the accelerator solution. In particular, it<br>
should be emphasized that the accelerator solution does not contain a<br>
polymeric resin.<br>
Due to the presence of the oxygen-containing solvent, the accelerator solution<br>
has a storage stability of at least about 2 weeks. This means that after storage<br>
at 20°C for at least 2 weeks, the accelerating activity - measured as the time to<br>
peak (TTP) in minutes - has decreased by no more than 10%. Preferably, also<br>
the peak exotherm, in °C (PE), has decreased by no more than 10%.<br>
The peak exotherm is defined as the maximum temperature reached in a time-<br>
temperature curve measured at ambient temperature (20°C), according to the<br>
method outlined by the Society of Plastic Institute, and available from Akzo<br>
Nobel Polymer Chemicals (standard method F/77.1). The time to peak is the<br>
time, in minutes, required to reach this maximum temperature. According to this<br>
method, 25 g of a mixture comprising 100 parts by weight of polyester resin, 2<br>
parts by weight of peroxide, and 0.25 parts by weight of accelerator solution are<br>
poured into a test tube and a thermocouple is placed through the enclosure at<br>
the centre of the tube. The glass tube is then placed in an oil bath and<br><br>
4<br>
maintained at a specific test temperature and the time-temperature curve is<br>
measured.<br>
Preferably, the storage stability of the accelerator solution according to the<br>
invention is at least 4 weeks, more preferably at least 6 weeks, and most<br>
preferably at least 8 weeks.<br>
Due to this storage stability, the solution containing both the metal salt<br>
accelerator and the reducing agent can be handled commercially in one single<br>
package. Further, with the use of this accelerator solution both the reducing<br>
agent and the metal salt accelerator can be added as one stream during curing<br>
and polymerisation initiation processes, which makes these processes simpler<br>
and more cost-efficient.<br>
With the accelerator solution according to the invention, crystal clear end<br>
products may be produced. In addition, they can be made cobalt-free and<br>
colourless.<br>
The accelerator solution according to the invention comprises one or more<br>
reducing agents, at least one of them being selected from ascorbic acid and<br>
sodium formaldehyde sulphoxylate (SFS). Ascorbic acid, which term in this<br>
specification includes L-ascorbic acid and D-isoascorbic acid, is the preferred<br>
reducing agent.<br>
Examples of reducing agents which can be present in addition to ascorbic acid<br>
or SFS are reducing sugars like glucose and fructose, oxalic acid, phosphines,<br>
phosphites, organic or inorganic nitrites, organic or inorganic sulphites, organic<br>
or inorganic sulphides, mercaptanes, amines, and aldehydes. Also a mixture of<br>
ascorbic acid and SFS, optionally in combination with other reducing agents,<br>
may be used.<br>
The reducing agent is present in the accelerator solution in an amount of more<br>
than 1.0 wt%, preferably at least 2 wt%, and most preferably at least 5%. It is<br><br>
5<br>
preferably present in an amount of less than 30 wt%, more preferably less than<br>
20 wt%, all based on the total weight of the accelerator solution. The term "more<br>
than 1.0 wt%" does not include the value 1.0 wt%.<br>
The accelerator solution further contains one or more metal salts, at least one of<br>
them being selected from the group consisting of transition metal salts, lithium<br>
salts, and magnesium salts. Preferred metal salts are copper, cobalt, iron,<br>
nickel, tin, manganese, vanadium, lithium, and magnesium saits. More<br>
preferred metal salts are copper, cobalt, iron, and vanadium salts. Due to the<br>
toxicity of cobalt and vanadium, copper and iron salts are the most preferred<br>
metal saits.<br>
Combinations of metal salts - e.g. vanadium and copper salts, vanadium and<br>
iron salts - can also be used.<br>
The salt employed preferably is a halide, nitrate, sulphate, lactate, 2-ethyl<br>
hexanoate, acetate, proprionate, butyrate, oxalate laurate, oleate, linoleate,<br>
palmitate, stearate, acetyl acetonate, or naphthenate. More preferred salts are<br>
halides, nitrates, sulphates, lactates, 2-ethyl hexanoates, and acetates.<br>
Examples of such salts are Cu(ll) acetate, Cu(ll) sulphate, Cu(ll) 2-ethyl<br>
hexanoate, Co(ll) acetate, Fe(ll) sulphate, Fe(lll) chloride, V(ll) 2-ethyl<br>
hexanoate, and combinations thereof.<br>
The metal salt(s) is/are present in the accelerator solution in a preferred total<br>
amount of at least 0.01 wt%, more preferably at least 0.1 wt%. The metal salt(s)<br>
is/are preferably present in a total amount of less than 10 wt%, more preferably<br>
less than 5 wt%, and most preferably less than 2 wt%, calculated as salt(s) and<br>
based on the total weight of the accelerator solution.<br>
The organic oxygen-containing solvent is a solvent comprising at least one<br>
oxygen atom and capable of forming a complex with the metal present in the<br>
accelerator solution. The solvent preferably has a melting point of 0°C or less.<br><br>
6<br>
In general, the solvent will carry an aldehyde, ketone, ether, ester, alcohol,<br>
phosphate, or carboxylic acid group.<br>
Examples of suitable solvents are glycols such as ethylene glycol, glycerol,<br>
diethylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, and polyethylene glycol; isobutanol;<br>
pentanol; 1,2-dioximes, N-methyl pyrrolidinone, N-ethyl pyrrolidinone;<br>
phosphorus-containing compounds such as diethyl phosphate, dibutyl<br>
phosphate, tributyl phosphate, triethyl phosphate, dibutyl phosphite, and triethyl<br>
phosphite; esters such as dibutyl maleate, dibutyl succinate, ethyi acetate, butyl<br>
acetate, methyl acetoacetate, ethyl acetoacetate, mono- and diesters of<br>
ketoglutaric acid, pyruvates, and esters of ascorbic acid such as ascorbic<br>
palmitate; 1,3-diketones and aldehydes, in particular acetyl acetone, benzoyl<br>
acetone, and dibenzoyl methane; mono- and diesters, more in particular diethyl<br>
malonate and succinates; 1,2-diketones, in particular diacetyl and glyoxal; butyl<br>
dioxytol (also known as diethylene glycol monobutyl ether, formula<br>
nBuOCH2CH20CH2CH2OH), benzyl alcohol, and fatty alcohols.<br>
Preferred solvents are triethyl phosphate, dibutyl phosphate, ethylene glycol,<br>
diethylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, N-methyl pyrrolidone, ethyl acetate, and<br>
butyl acetate.<br>
A mixture of two or more of the aforementioned solvents may also be used.<br>
The accelerator solution preferably comprises at least 50 wt%, more preferably<br>
at least 70 wt%, and preferably less than 95 wt%, more preferably less than 90<br>
wt% of solvent, all based on the total weight of the accelerator solution.<br>
A stabiliser may be present in the accelerator solution according to the<br>
invention. Suitable stabilisers are compounds that typically prevent<br>
crystallisation of the metal salt(s) in the solution, for example tertiary amines<br>
such as triethyl amine, triethanol amine, and dimethylamino ethanol;<br>
polyamines such as 1,2-(dimethyl amine)ethane; secondary amines such as<br>
diethanol amine (DETA) and diethyl amine; monoethanol amine; nicotinamide;<br><br>
7<br>
diethyl acetoacetamide; itaconic acid; monobutyl dihydrophosphite; and alkali<br>
metal 2-ethyl hexanoates such as lithium 2-ethyl hexanoate, potassium 2-ethyl<br>
hexanoate, sodium 2-ethyl hexanoate, barium 2-ethyl hexanoate, and cesium 2-<br>
ethyl hexanoate.<br>
The stabilisers may be added to the accelerator solution as such, or they may<br>
be formed in situ. For example, alkali metal 2-ethyl hexanoates can be prepared<br>
in situ in the accelerator solution, after addition of the alkali metal hydroxide and<br>
2-ethyl hexanoic acid to the solution.<br>
If one or more stabiliser(s) is/are present in the accelerator solution, their<br>
amount preferably is at least 0.01 wt%, more preferably at least 0.1 wt%, and<br>
preferably not more than 20 wt%, more preferably not more than 10 wt%, all<br>
based on the total weight of the accelerator solution.<br>
The accelerator solution according to the present invention may optionally<br>
comprise water. If present, the water content of the solution preferably is at<br>
least 0.01 wt% and more preferably at least 0.1 wt%. The water content is<br>
preferably not more than 50 wt%, more preferably not more than 40 wt%, more<br>
preferably not more than 20 wt%, even more preferably not more than 10 wt%,<br>
and most preferably not more than 5 wt%, all based on the total weight of the<br>
accelerator solution.<br>
The accelerator solution according to the present invention can be prepared by<br>
simply mixing the ingredients, optionally with intermediate heating and/or mixing<br>
steps. There is no specific order of addition which has to be applied. For<br>
example, first the one or more stabilisers may be added to the one or more<br>
solvents, after which the metal salt(s) is/are added, followed by the reducing<br>
agent(s). Another option is the addition of the one or more stabilisers to the one<br>
or more solvents, after which the reducing agent(s) is/are added, followed by<br>
the metal salt(s). Or the metal salt(s) is/are first added to the solvent(s),<br><br>
8<br>
followed by the addition of the stabiliser(s) and the reducing agent(s).<br>
Alternatively, all ingredients can be added at the same time.<br>
The accelerator solution according to the present invention can be used for<br>
curing and polymerisation initiation with several classes of peroxides. This is<br>
surprising, because until now the activation of peroxides other than<br>
hydroperoxides and ketone peroxides - such as peroxy dicarbonates - could<br>
not be achieved by metal complex accelerators at low temperatures.<br>
Suitable peroxides to be used in combination with the accelerator solution of the<br>
invention are hydroperoxides, ketone peroxides, peresters, peroxy carbonates,<br>
perketals, diacyl peroxides, and peroxy dicarbonates.<br>
It has also been found that, using a Co-containing accelerator according to the<br>
invention in combination with ketone peroxides, only a minor amount of Co -<br>
less than 0.01 wt% or even less than 0.001 wt% - is required to give a<br>
satisfactory curing reactivity.<br>
The accelerator solution can also be used as paint dryer in coating<br>
compositions.<br>
Curing<br>
The invention further relates to a process for curing unsaturated polyester (UP)<br>
and acrylate resins. In such curing processes, it is common practice to first<br>
prepare the polyester or acrylate compound and, if desired, to combine this<br>
compound with an ethylenically unsaturated monomeric compound. Such<br>
mixtures are commercially available. The curing is generally started by adding<br>
the accelerator solution according to the invention and the initiator (peroxide) to<br>
the Dolvester or acrvlate resin.<br><br>
9<br>
As a result of the storage stability of the accelerator solution of the present<br>
invention, it is also possible to pre-mix the resin and the accelerator solution<br>
days or weeks before the addition of the peroxide and, consequently, the start<br>
of the actual curing process. This allows commercial trade of a curable resin<br>
composition which already contains an accelerator and a reducing agent. The<br>
present invention therefore also relates to a composition comprising a curable<br>
unsaturated polyester or a curable acrylate resin and the accelerator solution<br>
according to the present invention.<br>
When both the peroxide and the accelerator solution according to the invention<br>
have been added to the curable resin, the resulting mixture is mixed and<br>
dispersed. The curing process can be carried out at any temperature from -5°C<br>
up to 250°C, depending on the initiator system, the accelerator system, the<br>
compounds to adapt the curing rate, and the resin composition to be cured.<br>
Preferably, it is carried out at ambient temperatures commonly used in<br>
applications such as hand lay-up, spray-up, filament winding, resin transfer<br>
moulding, coating (e.g. gel-coat and standard coatings), button production,<br>
centrifugal casting, corrugated sheets or flat panels, relining systems, kitchen<br>
sinks via pouring compounds, etc. However, it can also be used in SMC, BMC,<br>
pultrusion techniques, and the like, for which temperatures up to 180°C, more<br>
preferably up to 150CC, most preferably up to 100°C are used.<br>
UP resins include so-called ortho resins, iso-resins, iso-npg resins, vinyl ester<br>
resins, and dicyclopentadiene (DCPD) resins. Examples of such resins are<br>
maleic, fumaric, allylic, vinylic, and epoxy-type materials.<br>
Acrylate resins include acrylates, methacrylates, diacrylates and<br>
dimethacrylates and oligomers thereof.<br>
If desired, the UP resin or acrylate resin may be combined with one or more<br>
ethylenically unsaturated reactive monomers. Preferred ethylenically<br><br>
10<br>
unsaturated reactive monomers include styrene and styrene derivatives such as<br>
a-methyl styrene, vinyl toluene, indene, divinyl benzene, vinyl pyrrolidone, vinyl<br>
siloxane, vinyl caprolactam, stilbene, but also diallyl phthalate, dibenzylidene<br>
acetone, allyl benzene, methyl methacrylate, methylacrylate, (meth)acrylic acid,<br>
diacrylates, dimethacrylates, acrylamides; vinyl acetate, triallyl cyanurate, triallyl<br>
isocyanurate, allyl compounds which are used for optical application (such as<br>
(di)ethylene glycol diallyl carbonate), and mixtures thereof.<br>
The amount of ethylenically unsaturated monomer is preferably at least 0.1<br>
wt%, based on the weight of the resin, more preferably at least 1 wt%, and most<br>
preferably at least 5 wt%. The amount of ethylenically unsaturated monomer is<br>
preferably not more than 50 wt%, more preferably not more than 40 wt%, and<br>
most preferably not more than 35 wt%.<br>
In this curing process, the accelerator solution is generally employed in a<br>
conventional amount. Amounts of at least 0.01 wt%, preferably at least 0.1 wt%,<br>
and not more than 5 wt%, preferably not more than 2 wt% of the accelerator<br>
solution, based on the weight of the resin, are typically used.<br>
Peroxides suitable for the curing of UP and acrylate resins include organic<br>
peroxides, such as conventionally used ketone peroxides, peresters, and<br>
peroxydicarbonates, but also peroxycarbonates, perketals, hydroperoxides and<br>
diacyl peroxides. The skilled person will understand that these peroxides can be<br>
combined with conventional additives, for instance phlegmatisers, such as<br>
hydrophilic esters and hydrocarbon solvents.<br>
The amount of peroxide to be used in the curing process is preferably at least 0.1<br>
wt%, more preferably at least 0.5 wt%, and most preferably at least 1 wt%. The<br>
amount of peroxide is preferably not more than 8 wt%, more preferably not more<br>
than 5 wt%, most preferably not more than 2 wt%, all based on the weight of the<br>
resin.<br><br>
11<br>
Other optional additives may be employed in the curing process according to<br>
the invention, such as fillers, glass fibres, pigments, inhibitors, and promoters.<br>
In the curing process of the present invention, typically the resin is first mixed<br>
with the monomer. The accelerator composition can be added in several<br>
different manners and may have been pre-mixed with the monomer or resin.<br>
The peroxide formulation can be added directly to the mixture. However, it can<br>
aiso be first mixed with the monomer or resin. Care is to be taken that the<br>
peroxide formulation and the accelerator solution are not pre-mixed, since this<br>
would be hazardous.<br>
Polymerisation initiation<br>
The accelerator solution according to the present invention can also be used to<br>
accelerate the polymerisation initiation in redox polymerisation processes.<br>
Such polymerisation processes may be carried out in the usual manner, for<br>
example in bulk, suspension, emulsion, or solution.<br>
The peroxide and the accelerator solution can be added at the start of the<br>
polymerisation process, or they can be dosed partly or in their entirety during<br>
the polymerisation process. It is also possible to add the peroxide at the start of<br>
the polymerisation process, while the accelerator solution is added during the<br>
said process, or vice versa.<br>
The desired amounts of peroxide and accelerator solution vary depending on<br>
the polymerisation temperature, the capacity for removing the heat of<br>
polymerisation, the kind of monomer to be used, and the applied pressure.<br>
Usually, from 0.001-10 wt% peroxide, based on the weight of the (co)polymer,<br>
is employed. Preferably, from 0.001-5 wt% of peroxide is employed and most<br>
preferably from 0.001-2 wt%. The ratio of peroxide to metal salt preferably<br>
ranges from 0.2-100.<br><br>
12<br>
The polymerisation temperature usually is 5° to 300°C, preferably 10° to 180°C.<br>
In general, if it is below 5°C, the polymerisation time becomes too long.<br>
However, when it exceeds 300°C, the radical is spent in the initial stage of the<br>
polymerisation, making it difficult to attain a high conversion. In order to reduce<br>
the amount of unreacted monomer, however, it is also possible to conduct the<br>
polymerisation using a temperature profile, e.g., to perform the initial<br>
polymerisation at below 100°C and then elevate the temperature above 100°C<br>
to complete the polymerisation. These variations are all known to the man<br>
skilled in the art, who will have no difficulty selecting the reaction conditions of<br>
choice, depending on the particular polymerisation process and the specific<br>
radical polymerisation initiator to be used.<br>
Suitable monomers for polymerisation using the accelerator solution according<br>
to the present invention are olefinic or ethylenically unsaturated monomers, for<br>
example substituted or unsubstituted vinyl aromatic monomers, including<br>
styrene, a-methyl styrene, p-methyl styrene, and halogenated styrenes; divinyl<br>
benzene; ethylene; ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acids and derivatives<br>
thereof, such as (meth)acrylic acids, (meth)acrylic esters, such as 2-ethylhexyl<br>
acrylate, 2-ethylhexyl methacrylate, and glycidyl methacrylate; ethylenically<br>
unsaturated nitriles and amides, such as acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile, and<br>
acrylamide; substituted or unsubstituted ethylenically unsaturated monomers,<br>
such as butadiene, isoprene, and chloroprene; vinyl esters, such as vinyl<br>

In the examples below, the curing of the unsaturated polyester resins was<br>
analysed by the method of the Society of Plastic Institute (analysis method<br>
F/77.1; available from Akzo Nobel Polymer Chemicals). This method involves<br>
measuring of the peak exotherm, the time to peak, and the gel time.<br>
According to this method, 25 g of a mixture comprising 100 parts of polyester<br>
resin, 2 parts of peroxide, and 0.25 parts of accelerator solution were poured<br>
into a test tube and a thermocouple was placed through the enclosure at the<br>
centre of the tube. The glass tube was then placed in the oil bath maintained at<br>
a specific test temperature and the time-temperature curve was measured.<br>
From the curve the following parameters were calculated:<br>
Gel time (Gt) = time in minutes elapsed between the start of the experiment and<br>
5.6°C above the bath temperature.<br>
Time to peak exotherm (TTP) = time elapsed between the start of the<br>
experiment and the moment that the peak temperature is reached.<br>
Peak exotherm (PE) = the maximum temperature which is reached.<br>
Example 1<br>
Accelerator solution A, according to the invention, was prepared by first mixing<br>
the solvent and the stabiliser at ambient temperature. Then the metal salt was<br>
added and the mixture was slowly heated to 80°C. At 80°C the reducing agent<br>
was added and the total mixture was stirred for another 30 min at decreasing<br>
temperature. The composition of the resulting solution is shown in Table 1.<br>
Table 1<br><br>
		A (wt%)<br>
solvent:	di-ethylene glycol	84<br>
stabiliser:	nicotinamide	0.25<br>
metal salt:	Cu(ll) acetate	0.20<br>
reducing agent:	D-iso ascorbic acid	15.55<br><br>
15<br>
The storage stability of this composition was tested by curing Palatal® P6 resin<br>
with Trigonox® C at an initial temperature of 20°C, using the accelerator<br>
solutions direct after preparation and after storage for 2, 4, and 8 weeks at 20°<br>
or 40°C. Per 100 grams of resin, 2 grams of Trigonox® C and 0.25 gram<br>
accelerator solution were used in these tests. Table 2 indicates the gel time<br>
(Gt), Peak Exotherm (PE), and Time to Peak (TTP) measured.<br>
Table 2<br><br>

	4	6.8	17.8	162<br>
	8	6.9	17.3	161<br>
Table 2 shows that after 8 weeks of storage, the accelerator solution showed no<br>
significant decrease in activity.<br>
Example 2<br>
The storage stability of a premix of a UP-resin with 1 wt% of accelerator A was<br>
measured on pre-gellation in the NOURY® - Potlifetimer by means of a metal<br>
ball which is moved upwards in a test tube by using a magnet. The lapse of time<br>
between the addition of the accelerator to the resin and the moment the metal<br>
ball cannot be moved anymore is called the pot life.<br>
The results are shown in Table 3.<br><br>

Example 3<br>
In this experiment, three accelerator solutions were used:<br>
-	accelerator solution A (see Table 1)<br>
-	accelerator solution B, which only differs from solution A in that it additionally<br>
contains 1 wt% of Cobalt(ll) acetate<br>
-	a commercial Co-containing solution comprising an oxygen-containing solvent<br>
but no reducing agent (comparative solution C).<br>
These solutions were tested for the curing of Palatal® P6 resin with Butanox®<br>
M50 at initial temperatures of 20CC. Per 100 grams of resin, 2 grams of<br>
peroxide were used in these tests. The amount of accelerator solution (per 100<br>
grams resin) and the weight percentage of cobalt present in the curable<br>
composition are indicated in Table 4. This Table further shows the gel time (Gt)<br>
measured.<br>
Table 4<br><br>
solution	amount used	(gram)	wt% cobalt	Gt (min)<br>
A	0.35		-	6.8<br>

C	0.35		0.0137	5.8<br>
C	0.021		0.00082	100<br><br>
17<br>
These results show that accelerator solutions according to the invention<br>
(solutions A and B) provide a satisfactory curing rate, which is comparable with<br>
that of a similar amount of a commercial solution.<br>
The results further show that with the accelerator solutions according to the<br>
invention less cobalt is required to obtain desirable results than when using the<br>
commercial solution.<br>

5; all in weight percentages) according to the procedure of Example 1. These<br>
solutions were tested for the curing of Palatal® P6 resin with Trigonox® 21 and<br>
Trigonox® 117 at initial temperatures of 20°C. Per 100 grams of resin, 2 grams<br>
of peroxide and 0.5 gram of accelerator solution were used in these tests. Table<br>
