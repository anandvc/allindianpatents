More particularly, the present invention is concerned with a process for producing an a -olefin oligomer which is capable of producing a high quality a -olefin oligomer having enhanced purity, in the case of producing an a -olefin oligomer which has a double bond and 4 to 24 carbon atoms and which is useful as a starting material for high molecular polymers, plasticizers, surfactants and the like by the use of a Ziegler based catalyst.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
An a -olefin oligomer which has a double bond and 4 to 24 carbon atoms is a useful substance which is widely used as a starting monomer material for olefin polymers, as a comonomer for a variety of high molecular polymers, as a starting material for plasticizers, surfactants, etc. The a -olefin oligomer is produced usually by oligomerizing ethylene as the starting raw material by the use of a Ziegler based catalyst. In general, the production process comprises a step of origomerization reaction, a step of recovering unreacted ethylene, a step of deactivating and deashing the catalyst and a step of fractionating the solvent used therein and the a -olefin oligomer (see, for example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (kokai) No.3-220 135).<br>
In the aforesaid production process, the origomerization reaction is put into practice  usually by  one  step  composed of one<br><br>
reactor. In general, the a -olefin oligomer that is produced by the above-mentioned step involves a problem in that it often contains such impurities as paraffin, internal olefin and branched olefin, which bring about marked deterioration in, the quality of a polyethylene resin and the like as the final product.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
It has been desired from the above-mentioned standpoint to develop a process for producing an a -olefin oligomer which is capable of producing a high quality a -olefin oligomer minimized in the content of impurities, in the case of subjecting an a -olefin to oligomerization reaction by the use of a Ziegler based catalyst as the origomerization catalyst.

That is to say, it is a general object of the present invention to provide a process for producing an a -olefin oligomer which is capable of producing a high quality a -olefin oligomer free from an impurity by the use of a Ziegler based catalyst. In view of the above-mentioned subject, intensive extensive research and investigation were accumulated by the present inventors. As a result, it has been found that the object of the present invention can be achieved by carrying out oligomerization reaction through multi-stage reaction, supplying each of a plurality of the stages with an a -olefin as a starting material component, and controlling the reaction. Thus the present invention has been accomplished on the basis of the foregoing findings and information.<br>
Specifically,   the   present   invention   provides   a   process   for producing an   a -olefin oligomer which comprises subjecting an    a<br><br>
-olefin to oligomerization reaction in an organic solvent in the presence of a Ziegler based catalyst, wherein the foregoing oligomerization reaction is carried out through multi-stage reaction, and the a -olefin is supplied to each of the reaction stages.<br>

The    oligomerization    reaction    of    a -olefin   according    to    the present invention is put into practice usually in an organic solvent. Examples  of the  organic  solvent include  naphthene  base  paraffin such   as   cyclohexane   and   decalin,   aromatic  hydrocarbons  such  as<br><br>
benzene,	toluene,	xylene,	chlorobenzene,	ethylbenzene,<br>
dichlorobenzene and chlorotoluene, halogenide thereof, aliphatic hydrocarbons such as pentane, hexane, heptane, octane, nonane and decane, haloalkanes such as dichloroethane and dichlorobutane, and the like solvents.<br>
With regard to the blending proportions of the foregoing components (A), (B) and (C) and the foregoing organic solvent in the present invention, the amount of the component(A) is usually 0.01 to 5 mmol, preferably 0.03 to 1 mmol, the amount of the component (B) is usually 0.05 to 15 mmol, preferably 0.06 to 3 mmol, and the amount of the component (C) is usually 0.05 to 20 mmol, preferably 0.1 to 10 mmol in the case of using the above-mentioned sulfur compound, preferably 0.05 to 5 mmol in the case of using the aforesaid nitrogen or phosphorus compound, on the basis of250 ml ofthe organic solvent.<br>
In addition, more preferable result is obtainable by setting the blending proportions of the foregoing components (A) and (B) to 1 to 15 expressed in terms ofAl / Zr orTi (molar ratio).<br>
The oligomerization reaction of an a -olefin in the present invention is carried out through multi-stage reaction steps. Specifically, the above-mentioned multi-stage reaction steps are preferably constituted of at least two stage reactors arranged in series, and are particularly preferably constituted of two or three stage reaction steps.<br>
In the oligomerization reaction constituted of the aforesaid multi-stage reaction steps according to the present invention, it is indispensable to supply each of the reaction steps with an a -olefin as a starting material component, and it is preferable with respect<br><br>
to the working effect of the present invention to regulate the reacting weight in each of the reaction steps so as to equalize the reacting weight therein as much as possible. In addition, it is also preferable to regulate the retention timeor catalyst supply amount in each of the reaction steps so as to attain such reacting weight in each of the reaction steps. Supply of the above-stated catalyst and organic solvent to the second and subsequent steps is not always necessary, but can be conducted at need.<br>
It is possible to put the reaction conditions and the like into practice specifically in the following manner in each step of the multi-stage reaction steps.<br>
In the case where two-stage reaction steps are adopted, for instance, a first stage reactor is continuously charged at first with a reaction solvent, catalyst and a -olefin, while enabling the reaction temperature to be set on a temperature at which the catalyst exhibits effective activity, and pressure control to be conducted by regulating the a -olefin supply amount. Reaction liquid thus obtained is taken out therefrom, and is introduced in a second stage reactor, while separately supplying the a -olefin to the second stage reactor. In this case, supply of the above-stated catalyst and organic solvent to the second stage reactor is not always necessary, but can be conducted properly and optionally at need. During the reaction, the ratio of the oligomerizing reacting weight in the first stage reactor to that in the second stage reactor, that is, the ratio of (the oligomerizing reacting weight in the first stage reactor): (the oligomerizing reacting weight in the second stage reactor) is preferably in the range of 30 : 70 to 70 : 30. When     the     above-mentioned     ratio     departs     from     such     range,<br><br>
impurities in the a -olefin oligomer to be obtained often increase, deteriorating the purity of the product. In particular in the present invention, the foregoing ratio is more preferably in the range of 40 : 60 to 60 : 40, particularly preferably 50 : 50, approximately. From the similar viewpoint, in the case of adopting three stage reaction steps, the ratio of [(the oligomerizing reacting weight in each of the stages) / (the oligomerizing reacting weight in whole)] X 100 is preferably within the range of 20 to 40%, and the ratio thereof in each of the steps is particularly preferably 33.3 : 33.3 : 33.3, approximately.<br>
In the present invention, the oligomerization reaction in each of the reaction steps of the above-mentioned multi-stage reaction steps can be carried out usually at a temperature in the range of 100 to 150°C under pressure of 30 to 90 kg / cm 2 • G (2.94 to 8.82 MPa). The reaction time in each of the reaction steps, which varies depending upon the temperature and pressure and accordingly can not be unequivocally determined, is usually 5 to 40 minutes per each of the steps, making a total of 10 to 60 minutes, approximately.<br>
In the production process according to the present invention, the a -olefin to be used as a starting material is an a -olefin having 2 to 4 carbon atoms, preferably ethylene, and the a -olefin oligomer to be obtained is an a -olefin oligomer having the number of carbon atoms of 4 or more, particularly 4 to 18. Specific examples thereof include 1-butene, 1-hexene, 1-octene, 1-decene, 1-dodecene, 1 -tetradecene, 1-hexadecene and 1-octadecene. The a -olefin oligomer is formed as a mixture thereof.<br>
In the process  according  to the  present  invention,  the  liquid<br><br>
reaction product obtained by the oligomerization reaction of an a -olefin is subjected to subsequent recovery of unreacted a -olefin, deactivation of the catalyst and deashing treatment. In this case, it is preferable to maintain the temperature of, the liquid reaction product after the completion of the oligomerization reaction at 90°C or higher. The temperature thereof is not specifically limited provided that it is 90°C or higher, but is in the range of usually 90 to 150°C, preferably 100 to 130°C. The temperature thereof, when being unreasonably high, is unfavorable, since it often brings about deterioration of product purity.<br>
The amount of by-produced polymer, which varies depending upon the reaction conditions, is not unequivocal, but is usually 300 to 500 ppm. The by-produced polymer is dissolved in the liquid reaction product when the temperature thereof is kept at 9 0°C or higher, thereby enabling to proceed with stable running irrespective of the type of the organic solvent to be used for the oligomerization reaction.<br>
Subsequently the catalyst is subjected to deactivation<br>
treatment by introducing a deactivating agent at a pressure of the<br>
treatment system of 4 kg / cm • G(0.39 MPa), approximately.<br>
Examples of the deactivating agent to be used therein include basic<br>
nitrogen compounds, water, alcohols, carboxylic acids and phenols.<br>
The basic nitrogen compounds among them are exemplified by<br>
ammonia and amines such as methylamine, ethylamine,<br>
propylamine,	butylamine,	pentylamine,	hexylamine,<br>
cyclohexylamine,    octylamine,    decylamine,    aniline,    benzylamine,<br>
naphthylamine,	dimethylamine,     diethylamine,     dibutylamine,<br>
diphenylamine,	methylphenylamine,	trimethylamine,<br><br>
triethylamine,      tributylamine,      triphenylamine,      pyridine      and picoline.<br>
In the present invention, the above-mentioned deactivation treatment is followed by deashing treatment and further recovery of the organic solvent and unreacted a -olefin by distillation. The recovered organic solvent and unreacted a -olefin are each recycled at need through the oligomerization reaction system.<br>
The objective a -olefin oligomers in the present invention are obtained as desirable mixed products of various a -olefin oligomers by means of distillation. The mixed products can be obtained in large amounts as a -olefin oligomers each having desirable number of carbon atoms by properly and optionally selecting the reaction conditions.<br>
In the following, some description will be given of the preferred embodiments of the present invention with reference to the attached drawings. FIG. 1 is an example of schematic process flow diagram which shows the production process for carrying out the present invention by using reactors composed of two stage reaction steps. In the process as illustrated in FIG. 1, a first reactor 1 is charged with a reaction catalyst, a reaction solvent and an a -olefin as a starting material to proceed with oligomerization reaction. Thus the liquid reaction product which is produced therein and composed of the reaction catalyst, the reaction solvent, unreacted a -olefin and a -olefin oligomers is introduced to a second reactor 1', which is further supplied with the a -olefin as the starting material to proceed with oligomerization reaction. Likewise, the liquid reaction product which   is   produced   in   the   second   reactor   1'   and   composed   of  the<br><br>
reaction catalyst, the reaction solvent, unreacted a -olefin and a<br>
-olefin oligomers is supplied to a first stage flash tank 3 via a<br>
control valve 2, and further to a second stage flash tank 6 via a<br>
control valve 5. The liquid product after the first stage flashing,<br>
prior to supply to the second stage flash tank, is heated in a heat<br>
exchanger 4 to be kept at a prescribed temperature or higher. In<br>
these flash tanks, the unreacted a-olefin which is dissolved in the<br>
liquid    reaction    product    is    recovered.	Thereafter    the    liquid<br>
reaction product is sent to a deactivator 8, where the catalyst is deactivated with a deactivating agent 13. Thus a slight amount of light a -olefin oligomer accompanying the recovered a -olefin is recovered in a pot 10, and is sent to the deactivator 8, and then to a deasher 9, and after cleaning with cleaning water 14, to a separating tank 15. Therein the a -olefin oligomer is separated into oil phase and water phase, and the water phase is discarded to the outside of the reaction e system as waste water 16. The oil phase is sent to a dissolving tank 19 equipped with a heat exchanger 17 and a pump 18, is again heated to completely dissolve the polymer in the oil phase, and thereafter is sent to the distillation system, where the solvent and the a -olefin are fractionated.<br>
In summarizing the working effect and advantage of the present invention, it is made possible thereby to produce highly pure a -olefin oligomer free from an impurity in the production of a -olefin oligomer by the used of a Ziegler based catalyst.<br>
In what follows, the present invention will be described in more detail with reference to working examples, which however shall never limit the present invention thereto.<br><br>
Example    1<br>
[ Preparation of catalyst]<br>
In a 500 milliliter (mL) flask equipped with a stirrer were introduced in an atmosphere of argon, 25 mmol of zirconium tetrachloride anhydride (ZrCl4) and 250 mL of dry cyclohexane with stirring for 10 minutes at room temperature. To the mixture thus prepared were added triethylaluminum [(C2H5)3A1] and then ethylaluminum sesquichloride [(C 2 H 5 ) 3 Al 2 CI 3 ], wherein the amounts of the triethylaluminum and ethylaluminum sesquichloride were regulated to (C 2 H 5) 3 Al 2 CI 3 / (C 2 H 5) 3 Al being 3.5 ( molar ratio) and [(C 2H 5) 3 Al 2 CI 3 + (C 2 H 5) 3 Al] / ZrCl4 being 7 (molar ratio). After adding all the components, the resultant mixture was heated at 70°C for 2 hours in an atmosphere of argon under stirring to form a complex so that liquid catalyst was prepared. [ Oligomerization reaction]<br>
Oligomerization reaction was continuously carried out by arranging in series, two sets of complete mixing tank type reactors (internal volume of 500 cc each), taking out reaction liquid from the first stage reactor, and supplying the second stage reactor with the reaction liquid.<br>
The above-prepared liquid catalyst was mixed with cyclohexane which had been dried in an atmosphere of argon so that the concentration of the zirconium tetrachloride was adjusted to 0.08 mmol /l mmol of cyclohexane. Further, thiophene was added to the mixture in an amount of three times molar ratio to the zirconium      tetrachloride      to      prepare      a      catalytic      solution.<br><br>
Subsequently a definite amount (700 cc/hour) of the catalytic solution was fed in the first stage reactor. The oligomerization reaction was carried out by taking out reaction liquid from the first stage reactor, while regulating the liquid,level to a constant value in the first stage reactor, and supplying the second stage reactor with the reaction liquid under the reactional conditions including a reaction temperature of 120°C , reaction pressure of 65 kg /cm        •   G  (  6.4  MPa  ),   stirring  at  a  revolutional  speed  of 500<br>
rpm,   and   continuous   supply  of highly  pure   ethylene   gas  so   as   to<br>
9 maintain  the  reaction pressure  at  65 kg / cm        •    G in  each of the<br>
reactors.     The   liquid  level  was  equivalent  to   200  cc   in  the  first<br>
stage reactor and 250 cc in the second stage reactor. The reaction<br>
time (retention time) based on the solvent was about 17 minutes in<br>
the   first  stage   reactor  and  about  21   minutes   in   the   second  stage<br>
reactor.     The  reaction  conditions  and  the  results   are   collectively<br>
given in Table 1.<br>
[Deactivation treatment of catalyst]<br>
The   deactivation   treatment-of   catalyst   was   carried   out   by<br>
continuously    supplying    the    deactivating    tank    with    the    liquid<br>
reaction product which had been obtained in  the  above-mentioned<br>
oligomerization reaction.     A deactivating agent consisting of 10%<br>
by  weight  of aqueous  ammonia was  supplied  at  28  g /  hour.      The<br>
deactivating tank was  operated  at   10 0°C    at  4  kg / cm        •   G  (0.39<br>
MPa)   under   stirring   at   a   revolutional   speed   of   700   rpm.       The<br>
liquid   product   after   the   deactivation   treatment   was   filtered   to<br>
filter   off   wax   component   by   using   filter   paper.      The   resultant<br>
filtrate  was  washed  twice  with  deionized water in  an  amount two<br>
times   that   of   the   filtrate,   and   then   was   dried   with   potassium<br><br>
carbonate anhydride. The colorless transparent liquid reaction product thus obtained was analyzed by gas chromatography to determine the distribution and purity of the a -olefin oligomer as the objective product. The product distribution was found by calculation through Schultz • Flory distribution from the result of gas chromatography for C-10 and more based on the operational loss.      The results are given in Table 1.<br>
Further in order to determine the reacting weight in the first stage reactor, a sample of the reaction liquid was collected from the first stage reactor, and was analyzed by gas chromatography in the same manner as above to determine the amount of the a -olefin oligomer thus formed.<br>
The reaction ratio in each of the reactors is calculated by [(reacting weight in each reactor / (total reacting weight in the all the reactors)) X 100 (molar percent). In Table 1, C 18 purity is the production ratio of 1-octadecene as the objective product to the total production amount of C 18 components. Examples    2 &amp; 3<br>
The procedure in Example 1 was repeated to carry out the oligomerization reaction except that the liquid level in the first stage reactor and also the liquid level in the second stage reactor were altered to the levels as given in Table 1. The reaction conditions and performance results are given in Table 1.<br>
Example   4<br>
The procedure in Example 3 was repeated to carry out the oligomerization reaction except that the feed lines of the catalyst and solvent leading  to the first stage reactor were branched,  and<br><br>
the catalyst and solvent in part were directly supplied to the second stage reactor through the branched lines. The reaction conditions and performance results are given in Table 1.<br>
Example    5<br>
In carrying out the oligomerization reaction in Example 1, a<br>
third stage reactor same as the first and second stage reactors was<br>
installed on the downstream side of the second stage reactor<br>
constituting three-stage reaction steps. Thus the oligomerization<br>
reaction was put into practice under the re actional conditions as<br>
given in Table 1, wherein the reactional conditions in the third<br>
stage reactor were set to a reaction temperature of 120°C, reaction<br>
pressure    of       65    kg   /   cm	•     G    (    6.4   MPa   ),    stirring    at    a<br>
revolutional speed of 500 rpm, and continuous supply of highly<br>
pure ethylene gas so as to maintain the reaction pressure at 65 kg /<br>
cm	•     G,   which   were   same   as   in   the   first   and   second   stage<br>
reactors. The reaction conditions and performance results are given in Table  1.<br>
Comparative Example    1<br>
The procedure in Example 1 was repeated to carry out the oligomerization reaction except that use was made of a first stage reactor having an internal volume of 1000 cc, the liquid level therein was set on 500 cc, and a second stage reactor was not used. The reaction conditions and performance results are given in Table 1.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
