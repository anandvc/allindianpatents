GELLED WATER-IN-OIL MICROEMULSIONS FOR HAIR TREATMENT<br>
HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br>
WO 2006/066668<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/012228<br><br>
GELLED  WATER-IN-OIL MICROEMULSIONS   FOR HAIR<br>
TREATMENT<br>
FIELD  OF THE   INVENTION<br>
5<br>
This invention relates to gelled water-in-oil microemulsions for hair treatment which have enhanced rheology, sensory properties and compatibility with hair benefit agents.<br>
10  BACKGROUND OF INVENTION AND PRIOR ART<br>
    Consumers oil hair both pre wash and post wash.  Pre wash oiling is done as it is believed that oils nourish hair and protect it during the wash process.  Post wash oiling is <br>
15  done for manageability and styling.  The oiling habit is widely practised by around 800 million people across the Central Asia and Middle East region.<br>
Coconut oil is by far the most common oil used in the 20  Central Asia and Middle East region for hair care.  It<br>
offers a high level of conditioning benefits, but with the drawback of greasy feel.<br>
    EP 1289479 discloses hair oils which incorporate a specific <br>
25  blend of oil types (glyceride fatty esters and hydrocarbon oils) and which can deliver an equivalent level of conditioning benefits to coconut oil, but with superior sensory properties, in particular less greasy feel.<br>
30  The oil should be easily applied or spread onto the hair by brush or fingers to provide uniform coverage of the oil<br><br>
WO 2006/066668<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/012228<br><br>

    throughout the hair.  However, once applied it should not drip or run off the hair. It would be desirable to incorporate a rheology modifier such as a gelling agent into the oil in order to improve these properties, but a problem <br>
5  is that the incorporation of gelling agent into the oil at a sufficient level to give the desired product rheology can result in sensory negatives such as a sticky, greasy feel.<br>
    The present inventors have found that this problem can be <br>
10  solved if the gelling agent is incorporated into a water-in-oil microemulsion formed with a particular type of nonionic emulsifier.  The gel so obtained exhibits enhanced viscosity and shear-thinning properties, yet without sensory negatives such as a sticky, greasy feel. Advantageously, it also <br>
15  exhibits enhanced compatibility with hair benefit agents such as hair styling agents and hair conditioning agents (which are normally incompatible with oils).<br><br>

The present invention provides a gelled water-in-oil microemulsion for hair treatment comprising:<br>
(a) an oil phase comprising:<br>
(i)   a first oily component which is one or more glyceride fatty esters, and<br><br>

(b) a hydrophilic phase comprising:<br>
(i)   water,<br>
(ii)   a nonionic emulsifier which is an ethoxylated alcohol having an HLB of at least 6, and<br><br>
(iii)  preferably, a hair styling agent or hair conditioning 10        agent, and<br>

15  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Microemulsion<br>
    By "microemulsion" is meant a thermodynamically or <br>
20      kinetically stable liquid dispersion of an oil phase and a hydrophilic phase. The dispersed phase typically comprises small particles or droplets, with a size range of 5 nm to 200 nm, giving rise to a microemulsion that is transparent or translucent in appearance. This is in contrast to regular <br>
25  (macro-) emulsions that are turbid. The droplets or<br>
    particles of the microemulsion may be spherical, although other structures are possible. The microemulsion is formed readily and sometimes spontaneously, generally without high-energy input.<br>

WO 2006/066668<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/012228<br><br>
4<br>
(a) (i)  Glyceride Fatty Ester<br>
    The gelled water-in-oil microemulsion of the invention comprises an oil phase comprising a first oily component<br>
 5  which is one or more glyceride fatty esters.<br>
By "glyceride fatty esters" is meant the mono-, di~, and tri-esters formed between glycerol and long chain carboxylic<br>
acids such as C6-C30 carboxylic acids.  The carboxylic acids<br>
10  may be saturated or unsaturated or contain hydrophilic groups such as hydroxyl.<br>
Preferred glyceride fatty esters are derived-from carboxylic acids of carbon chain length ranging from Cs  to C24,<br>
15  preferably C10 to C22 most preferably C12 to C18-<br>
    Suitable glyceride fatty esters for use in gelled microemulsions of the invention will generally have a viscosity at ambient temperature (25 to 30°C) of from 0.01<br>
20  to 0.8 Pa.s , preferably from 0.015 to 0.6 Pa.s, more<br>
preferably from 0.02 to 0.065 Pa.s as measured by a Carri-Med CSL2 100 controlled stress rheometer, from TA Instruments Inc., New Castle, Delaware (USA).<br>
25  A variety of these types of materials are present in<br>
vegetable and animal fats and oils, such as camellia oil, coconut oil, castor oil, safflower oil, sunflower oil, peanut oil, cottonseed oil, corn oil, olive oil, cod liver oil, almond oil, avocado oil, palm oil, sesame oil, lanolin<br>
30  and soybean oil.  These have various ranges of carbon chain<br><br>
WO 2006/066668<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/012228<br><br>
-   5  -<br>
   lengths depending on the source, typically between about 12 to about 18 carbon atoms.  Synthetic oils include trimyristin, triolein and tristearin glyceryl dilaurate. Vegetable derived glyceride fatty esters are particularly <br>
5  preferred, and specific examples of preferred materials for inclusion in gelled microemulsions of the invention as sources of glyceride fatty esters include almond oil, castor oil, coconut oil, sesame oil, sunflower oil and soybean oil. Coconut oil, sunflower oil, almond oil and mixtures thereof <br>
10  are particularly preferred.<br>
The glyceride fatty ester may be present in gelled microemulsions of the invention as a single material or as a blend.<br>
15<br>
The total content of glyceride fatty ester in gelled microemulsions of the invention suitably ranges from 10% to 95%, preferably from 20% to 80%, by weight based on total weight of the gelled microemulsion.<br>
20<br>
(a)(ii)  Hydrocarbon Oil<br>
     The oil phase of the gelled water-in-oil microemulsion of the invention comprises a second oily component which is one <br>
25   or more hydrocarbon oils of average carbon chain length less than 20 carbon atoms.<br>
       Suitable hydrocarbon oils include cyclic hydrocarbons, straight chain aliphatic hydrocarbons (saturated or<br>
 30  unsaturated), and branched chain aliphatic hydrocarbons<br>
(saturated or unsaturated).  Straight chain hydrocarbon oils<br><br>
WO 2006/066668<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/012228<br><br>
-   6   -<br>
     will typically contain from about 6 to about 16 carbon atoms, preferably from about 8 up to about 14 carbon atoms. Branched chain hydrocarbon oils can and typically may contain higher  numbers of carbon atoms, e.g. from about 6 up <br>
5   to about 20 carbon atoms, preferably from about 8 up to about 18 carbon atoms.<br>
     Suitable hydrocarbon oils will generally have a viscosity at ambient temperature {25 to 3D°C) of from 0.0001 to 0.5 Pa.s,<br>
10  preferably from 0.001 to 0.05 Pa.s, more preferably from 0.001 to 0.02 Pa.s as measured by a Carri-Med CSL2  100 controlled stress rheometer, from TA Instruments Inc., New Castle, Delaware (USA).<br>
15  A preferred hydrocarbon oil is light mineral oil.  Mineral oils are clear oily liquids obtained from petroleum oil, from which waxes have been removed, and the more volatile fractions removed by distillation.  The fraction distilling between 250°C to 300°C is termed mineral oil, and it consists<br>
20  of a mixture of hydrocarbons, in which the number of carbon<br>
atoms per hydrocarbon molecule generally ranges from C10 to<br>
C40.  Mineral oil may be characterised in terms of its<br>
     viscosity, where light mineral oil is relatively less viscous than heavy mineral oil, and these terms are defined <br>
25  more specifically in the U.S. Pharmacopoeia, 22nd revision, p. 899 (1990-) .  A commercially available example of a suitable light mineral oil for use in the invention is<br>
Sirius M40 (carbon chain length C10-C28/ mainly C12-C20/<br>
 viscosity 4.3 x 10  Pa.s), available from Silkolene.<br><br>
WO 2006/066668<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/012228<br><br>
-   7   -<br>
    Other hydrocarbon oils that may be used in the invention include relatively lower molecular weight hydrocarbons including linear saturated hydrocarbons such a tetradecane,<br>
 5  hexadecane, and octadecane, cyclic hydrocarbons such as dioctylcyclohexane (e.g. CETIOL S from Henkel), branched chain hydrocarbons (e.g. ISOPAR L and ISOPAR V from Exxon Corp.).<br>
10  The hydrocarbon oil may be present in gelled microemulsions of the invention as a single material or as a blend.<br>
    The total content of hydrocarbon oil in gelled microemulsions of the invention suitably ranges from 5% to<br>
15  90%, preferably from 20% to 80%, by weight based on total weight of the gelled microemulsion.<br>
    The glyceride fatty ester:hydrocarbon oil weight ratio in gelled microemulsions of the invention may suitably range<br>
20  from 90:10 to 10:90, preferably from 80:20 to 20:80, more preferably from 60:40 to 40:60. Particularly preferred are blends of [coconut oil and/or sunflower oil and/or almond oil] and light mineral oil, in which the [coconut oil and/oj sunflower oil and/or almond oil]:light mineral oil weight<br>
25  ratio is about 50:50.<br>
(b) (i) Water<br>
30  The hydrophilic phase of the gelled water-in-oil<br>
microemulsion of the invention comprises water, suitably at<br><br>
WO 2006/066668<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/012228<br><br>
-   8   -<br>
   a level of from about 2% by weight based on total weight of the gelled microemulsion. Suitably the water level does not exceed about 10% by weight based on total weight of the gelled microemulsion, since this may lead to a hazy product <br>
5  appearance which is undesirable to consumers of hair oils. Preferably the water level ranges from 3 to 7%, more preferably from 4 to 6% by weight based on total weight of the gelled microemulsion.<br>
10<br>
(b) (ii) Nonionic Emulsifier<br>
     The gelled water-in-oil microemulsion of the invention comprises a nonionic emulsifier which is an ethoxylated<br>
 15  alcohol having an  HLB of at least 6.<br>
     Suitable ethoxylated alcohols are commercially available and include the primary aliphatic alcohol ethoxylates and secondary aliphatic alcohol ethoxylates. The length of the<br>
 20  polyethenoxy chain can be adjusted to achieve the desired balance between the hydrophobic and hydrophilic elements.<br>
     The HLB value of the ethoxylated alcohol suitably ranges from 6 to 12, preferably from 7 to 10, more preferably from <br>
 25  7 to 9.<br>
     Examples of suitable ethoxylated alcohols include the condensation products of a higher alcohol (e.g., an alkanol containing about 8 to 16 carbon atoms in a straight or <br>
30  branched chain configuration) condensed with about 2.5 to 20 moles of ethylene oxide.<br><br>
WO 2006/066668<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/012228<br><br>
-   9   -<br>
    A preferred group of the foregoing ethoxylated alcohols are the Neodol ethoxylates (Shell Co.), which are higher aliphatic, primary alcohols containing about 9 to 15 carbon <br>
5  atoms condensed with about 2.5 to 20 moles of ethylene<br>
oxide. Specific examples are C9 to 11 alkanol condensed with 2.5 to 10 moles of ethylene oxide (Neodol 91-8 or Neodol 91-5), C12 to 13 alkanol condensed with 3 moles ethylene oxide (Neodol 23-3), C12 to 15 alkanol condensed with 12 moles<br>
10  ethylene oxide (Neodol 25-12), C14 to 15 alkanol condensed with 13 moles ethylene oxide (Neodol 45-13), and the like. Such ethoxylates have an HLB (hydrophobic lipophilic balance) value of about 7 to 10.  Most preferred is Neodol 23-3, with an HLB of about 8.<br>
15<br>
The level of nonionic emulsifier in gelled microemulsions of the invention suitably ranges from 10 to 40%, preferably from 15 to 35%, by weight based on total weight of the gelled microemulsion.<br>
20<br>
(b)(iii) Hair Styling Agent or Hair Conditioning Agent<br>
    The hydrophilic phase of the gelled water-in-oil microemulsion of the invention preferably comprises a hair <br>
25  styling agent or hair conditioning agent, most preferably a hair styling agent.<br>
     The hair styling agent can be a hair fixative or film former that imparts style-retention properties to hair, i.e., sets<br>
30  the hair.<br><br>

5   accordance with normal procedures. The shampooing and<br>
     rinsing procedure was repeated for a second application. The same procedure was followed for the other treated half head. After washing and rinsing was complete the mannequin head was allowed to dry at normal temperature (20 to 25 degrees<br>
