				<td>The present invention relates to a method of purifying racemic cis-6-phenyl-5-[4-(2-pyrrolidin-l-ylethoxy)phenyl)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydronaphthalen-2-oL.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a process for removing impurities from a racemic mixture of cis isomers of a compound of Formula I, c/'s-6-phenyt-5-[4-(2-pyrroiidin-1 -yiethoxy)phenyi]-5,6,7,8-tetrahydronaphthalen-2-ol, (hereinafter "racemic lasofoxifene" or "racemate").<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
This invention also relates to a purified racemic lasofoxifene, cis-6-plienyl-5-[4-(2-pyrrolidin-1-yiethoxy)phenyl]-5,6,7,8-tetrahydronaphthalen-2-ol, (l-ieretnafter "purified racemic lasofoxifene" or'purified racemate"), and purified lasofoxifene D-tartrate, (-)cis-6(S)-phenyl-5(R)-[4-(2-pyrrolidin-1 -ylethoxy)phenyr]-5,6,7,8-tetrahydronaphthalen-2-ol D-tartrate, which is useful as an estrogen agonist/antagonist, also known as a selective estrogen receptor modulator ("SERM"). Racemic lasofoxifene is an intermediate in the syntheses of lasofoxifene D-tartrate, having the following structure:<br>
(Structure Removed)<br>
Lasofoxifene, lasofoxifene D-tartrate, its racemate and processes for the preparation thereof, are disclosed in commonly assigned U.S. Patent No. 5,552,412, issued Septembers, 1996, and U, S. Patent No. 5,948,809, issued September 7, 1999. The text of these patents and all other references cited in this specification are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.<br>
Typically, drug substances preferably contain less than 0.2%. impurities, most preferably less than 0.1% impurities. During the scale-up process for commercial production of lasofoxifene D-tartrate, however, it was determined that the resulting lasofoxifene D-tartrate compound contained undesirable impurities greater than 0.2%. It was also determined that purification of lasofoxifene D-tartrate to less than 0.1% impurities was not commercially feasible at the proposed scale-up. Consequently, there was a need to obtain an intermediate of Lasofoxifene D-tartrate, having a purity of less than 0.1% impurities. The process described within the instant invention resolves this issue.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention is directed to a method of purifying racemic, cis-6-phenyl-5-[4-{2-pyrrolidin-1-ylethoxy)phenyl]-5,6,7,8-tetrahydronaphthalen-2-o!, which comprises:<br>

In a prefenred embodiment, said suspension so fonned in step (c) is collected by filtration, providing purified racemic c/s-6-phenyi-5- [4-(2-pyrroiidin-1-ylethoxy)phenyi]-5,6,7,8-tetrahydronaphthalen-2-ol, having less than 0.1% impurities.<br>
In another aspect, the invention is directed to purified racemic c/s-6-phenyl-5-[4-(2-pyrrolidin-1-ylethoxy)phenyl]-5,6,7,8-tetrahydronaphthalen-2-ol.<br>
The term "ambient temperature," as used here means about 15-25째C.<br>

The terms "purified racemate lasofoxifene," or "purified racemate," as used herein, means racemic cis-6-phenyl-5[4-(2-pyrroiidin-1-yiethoxy)phenyi]-5,6,7,8 tetrahydronaphthalen-2-ol, having less that 0.1% impurities.<br>
The term "purified lasofoxifene D-tartrate," as used herein, means (-)cis-6(S)-pheny!-5(RH4-(2-pyrrolidin-1-yiethoxy)phenyl]-5,6,7,8-tetrahydronaphthalen-2-ol D-tartrate, having less than 0.2% impurities.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION <br><br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
Lasofoxifene is a valuable estrogen/antagonist and is useful for, inter alia, oral contraception; relief for the symptoms of menopause; prevention of threatened or habitual abortion; relief of dysmenorrhea, relief of dysfunctional uterine bleeding; relief of endometriosis; an aid in ovarian development; treatment of acne; diminution of excessive growth of body hair in women (hirsuitism); the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease; prevention and treatment of arteriosclerosis; prevention and treatment of osteoporosis; treatment of benign prosatic hyperplasia and prostatic carcinoma obesity; and suppression of post-partum lactation. Lasofoxifene also has a beneficial effect on plasma lipid levels and, as such, is useful in treating and preventing hypercholesterolemia. While lasofoxifene is an estrogen agonist in bone, it is an antiestrogen in breast tissue and, as such would be useful in the treatment and prevention of breast cancer.<br>
Racemic lasofoxifene is the c/s-racemate of lasofoxifene, containing two asymmetric carbons corresponding to two optically active compounds. Resolution of the racemate has been accomplished by crystallization of the salt with R-(-)-1,1'binaphthyl-2,2'-diyl hydrogen phosphate ("R-binap"), as described in commonly owned U.S. Pat. No. 5,552,412. Resolution of the racemate was also accomplished by the addition of D-tartaric acid to the racemic or partially optically enriched cis-6-phenyl-5-[4-(2-pyrrolidin-1-ylethoxy)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydronaphthatene-2-ol, forming a 1:1 salt in aqueous ethanol, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,948,809. Upon cooling the (-) isomer is separated as a solid and is collected, providing the desired pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the (-) cis-D-tartrate isomer in high yield.<br>
Several purification methods were explored to reduce the amount of impurities in lasofoxifene D-tartrate to less than 0.2%, including recrystaliization and chromatography. These methods were unsatisfactory, either because of loss in yield or insufficient purity of lasofoxifene D-tartrate. It was determined that the desired level of purification (less than 0.1%) and optimal yield were obtained by the purification techniques described herein.<br>
As set forth in Scheme I and the examples, unpurified racemic lasofoxifene is combined with a mixture of ethanol and tetrahydrofuran in Step 1(a). A person of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the ratio of ethanol to tetrahydrofuran may vary. Preferably, however, the volume ratio is 1:1 to 4:1.<br>
In step 1(b), the resulting suspension was heated from about ambient temperature up to about 70째C and agitated for a time period between about 30 minutes and up to about 12 hours.  Preferably, however, the suspension is agitated for about 8 to about 12 hours. One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the duration of agitation of the above suspension may be extended beyond 12 hours. In step 1 (c), the heated suspension is then cooled to about ambient temperature with agitation for a time period from about 30 minutes to about 18 hours. Finally, in step 1(d), the solids may be collected by means known to those skilled in the art (e.g. filtration) and washed with an appropriate solvent {e.g. ethanol) and dried (e.g. in vacuo), providing purified racemic lasofoxifene.<br>
The purified racemic lasofoxifene may be resolved, as depicted in Step 11 and described in U.S. 5,948,809, providing purified lasofoxifene D-tartrate.<br>
A person of ordinary skill in the art would appreciate that the ratios of ethanol to tetrahydrofuran, the temperature, and the duration of heating and agitating may be varied. These variations are within the scope of this invention.<br>
