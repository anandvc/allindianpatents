				<td>Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a system and method for wirelessly<br>
and remotely reading an integrating meter which can wirelessly and remotely<br>
read integrated amounts of consumed electric power, water, gas and the like.<br>
Background Art<br>
Generally, metermen must personally read integrating meters such as<br>
electric power meters, gas meters, water meters, etc. to charge users rates for power<br>
 consumption, gas consumption, water consumption, etc. Namely, a meterman has to<br>
check a numerical value of a given integrating meter with the naked eye, record the<br>
checked value by hand, subtract a numerical value of the last month from the<br>
recorded value and issue a user a bill statement based on the resulting numerical<br>
value and an integrated amount-to-rate table.<br>
This meter reading process has a disadvantage in that it requires a large<br>
amount of manpower, leading to many expenses. Also, metermen may erroneously<br>
record numerical values of integrating meters, nobody may be present in visited<br>
houses, and persons in visited houses may refuse to permit the reading of integrating<br>
meters. Furthermore, meter reading centers require a large amount of manpower,<br>
leading to many expenses, to process numerical data recorded by metermen using<br>
computers.<br>
In particular, for power consumption, the amount of load power varies<br>
every moment and reserve power must be used to meet a demanded amount of<br>
power when the maximum load power is applied. Notably, to increase reserve<br>
 power by 1% necessitates a national enormous investment. In this regard, a<br>
charge-by-time system is required to fix a high power rate in the maximum load<br>
power time zone and a low power rate in the minimum load power time zone, for<br>
example, the night time, in turn resulting in a need for the development of remote<br>
meter reading units.<br>
In order to meet this requirement, a large number of remote meter reading<br>
units have been developed. These meter reading units may be, for example, a direct<br>
meter reading unit and an automatic meter reading (AMR) unit. The direct meter<br>
reading unit comprises a plurality of sensors instead of a conventional wheel<br>
structure on which a numerical value is recorded. The sensors are used to record a<br>
read numerical value. The AMR unit comprises sensor means including analog and<br>
digital circuits for converting physical and electrical amounts varying every moment<br>
into electrical pulses. The sensor means has a variety of sensors, such as a<br>
photosensor, magnetometric sensor, hall sensor, etc., which are provided on a<br>
rotating member of an integrating meter, such as a rotating disc or rotating drum,<br>
and the body of the meter. This AMR unit is adapted to continuously integrate<br>
numerical values and automatically transmit the integrated data upon receiving a<br>
meter reading request.<br>
In order to efficiently and economically perform the remote meter reading<br>
operation, it is necessary to provide synthetic meter reading means capable of<br>
synthetically reading all types of integrating meters including water meters, gas<br>
meters, hot water meters and the like as well as electric power meters. However,<br>
enormous development expenses and a lengthy period of time are required in<br>
constructing or modifying the same remote meter reading unit to install it in meters<br>
of different types, different capacities, different specifications and different systems.<br>
Further, external factors such as a flash of lighting, power surge, etc. may<br>
adversely affect the reliability and stability of meters. For example, such<br>
factors may damage circuits of meters. For this reason, meters must be verified<br>
for reliability and stability. However, a great cost and a large amount of time are<br>
usually required in performing such a verification.<br>
Moreover, integrating meters may be demonstratively installed for the<br>
testing of the remote meter reading operation. However, water meters and gas<br>
meters themselves are high in price and furthermore higher in installation cost,<br>
resulting in a considerable financial burden for their replacement with new ones. It<br>
is also impossible for conventional remote meter reading units to perform the<br>
remote meter reading operation for a lengthy period of time using batteries.<br>
Furthermore, when a remote meter reading function fails, a manual meter<br>
reading operation must be performed and no misreading of read values must occur<br>
during the reading operation. For the purpose of overcoming these problems and the<br>
above problem with the replacement installation, a remote meter reading module<br>
comprising a sensor attached to an existing meter is disclosed in Korean Patent<br>
Publication No. 1994-4879 However, this meter reading module is disadvantageous<br>
in that the body of the meter must be modified for installation of the module therein,<br>
resulting in reductions in reliability and stability and an increase in cost.<br>
On the other hand, various approaches have been proposed for the<br>
transmission and reception of data between automatic meter reading terminals and<br>
meter reading centers. In particular, a radio frequency (RF) system has been<br>
developed to solve an installation cost and management cost of a wired line, which<br>
is the most remarkable disadvantage of a wired system. However, in this RF<br>
system, a meter continuously consumes power because it updates an integrated<br>
value every moment. For this reason, the meter must comprise a separate power<br>
source or battery. For a gas or water meter depending on a battery, a meterman has<br>
to visit periodically (for example, every three to six months) for replacement of the<br>
battery due to the continuous power consumption.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
The present invention provides a wireless remote reading system for an<br>
integrating meter comprising an image preprocessor, a processor for reading<br>
identification and data codes, a small-sized optical character reader module<br>
including a one-chip memory for the processing of mass data, and a time controller<br>
having a normal sleep function for minimizing power consumption.<br>
With reference to Fig. 1, there is shown in block form the construction of a<br>
wireless remote reading system for an integrating meter in accordance with a<br>
preferred embodiment of the present invention. As shown in this drawing, the<br>
wireless remote reading system comprises an image sensor module 1 fixedly<br>
installed in a predetermined portion of the top wall or bottom wall of the<br>
integrating meter for sensing an image of a numeral on a display of the meter and<br>
converting the sensed image into an electrical signal.<br>
The image sensor module 1 includes a solid-state image sensor for picking<br>
up an image and converting the picked-up image into an electrical signal. The<br>
solid-state image sensor may preferably be a charge coupled device (CCD) image<br>
sensor, a bucket brigade device (BBD) image sensor, a plasma coupled device<br>
(PCD) image sensor, a complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) image<br>
sensor or a transparent plate image sensor composed of a plastic polymer transistor.<br>
The image sensor module 1 is installed in the top wall or bottom wall of the<br>
integrating meter at such a position that a meterman can personally read a numeral<br>
on the display with the naked eye. Alternatively, the image sensor module 1 may be<br>
made of a transparent material such that a meterman can personally read the<br>
numeral on the display with the naked eye irrespective of the installed position of<br>
the image sensor module 1.<br>
The image sensor module can be installed in integrating meters, such as<br>
electric power meters, water meters, gas meters and the like, in various ways, as<br>
shown in Figs. 2a to 2e. For example, the image sensor module may be attached on<br>
the internal surface or external surface of a cover or casing of an integrating meter<br>
or mounted to the meter cover or casing via a hole. Alternatively, the image sensor<br>
module may be installed in a predetermined portion of the integrating meter while<br>
being neither attached nor mounted on the cover or casing of the meter but spaced<br>
apart therefrom at a certain distance.<br>
Fig. 2a shows the structure of an image sensor module 20 mounted at a<br>
predetermined portion outside a transparent casing 22 of an electric power meter<br>
while being spaced apart from the casing 22 at a certain distance, and Fig. 2b shows<br>
the structure of an image sensor module 30 mounted at a predetermined portion<br>
outside a transparent window 32 of a water or gas meter while being spaced<br>
apart from the window 32 at a certain distance. A fixing member 21 or 31 is<br>
attached to the transparent casing 22 of the electric power meter or the transparent<br>
window 32 of the water or gas meter, and the image sensor module 20 or 30 is<br>
mounted to the top of the fixing member 21 or 31 in such a manner that it can pick<br>
up an image of a numeral on a display 23 or 33 of the power meter or the water or<br>
gas meter.<br>
As shown in Fig. 2c, an image sensor module 40, which includes a<br>
transparent plate image sensor composed of a plastic polymer transistor, may be<br>
attached directly to a transparent casing 42 or transparent window of an integrating<br>
meter to pick up an image of a numeral on a display 43 of the meter. This<br>
arrangement is made to prevent the image sensor module 40 from being externally<br>
projected. Further, the image sensor module 40 is transparent not to hide the display<br>
43. thereby making it easy to perform a manual meter reading operation when the<br>
wireless remote meter reading function fails. As an alternative, the image sensor<br>
module may be installed in the integrating meter at such a position that it does not<br>
hide the display. In this case, similarly, the manual meter reading operation can be<br>
performed easily at any time when the wireless remote meter reading function fails.<br>
Fig. 2d shows the structure of an image sensor module 50 installed in the<br>
bottom wall of an integrating meter at a predetermined portion inside a casing or<br>
transparent window of the meter for picking up a refracted numeral image. A<br>
transparent body 51 with a desired shape is attached on the bottom wall of the<br>
integrating meter at a predetermined portion under a display 53, and the image<br>
sensor module 50 is installed in the bottom wall of the integrating meter at a<br>
predetermined portion spaced apart from the transparent body 51 at a certain<br>
distance to pick up a numeral image projected on the body 51. In other words, the<br>
image sensor module of the present invention can pick up a numeral image on the<br>
display 53 even within the casing of the integrating meter.<br>
The transparent body 51, which refracts a numeral image on the display<br>
53, may have a variety of shapes, for example, a cylindrical shape as shown in Fig.<br>
3a, a right triangular shape with its edges rounded as shown in Fig. 3b, a typical<br>
right-angled triangular shape as shown in Fig. 3c and a prism shape as shown in Fig.<br>
3d. For the right-angled triangular transparent body, an angle of inclination of the<br>
sloping side relative to the base must be set in consideration of a refraction angle.<br>
The transparent body 61 having the prism shape as shown in Fig. 3d is<br>
applicable to a transparent plate image sensor module 60 as shown in Fig. 2e. In<br>
this case, the transparent body 61 and the transparent plate image sensor module 60<br>
may be implemented in a single unit, as shown in Fig. 2e, because the image sensor<br>
module 60 is able to pick up a numeral image projected on the body 61 in close<br>
proximity to the body 61. This implementation is applicable to an integrating meter<br>
wherein a display 63 and a casing 62 are spaced apart from each other at a narrow<br>
interval, in that it can minimize the distance between the transparent body 61 and<br>
the transparent plate image sensor module 60.<br>
Referring again to Fig. 1, a first data memory access controller (DMAC) 2<br>
is adapted to store digital image data corresponding to an electrical image signal<br>
from the image sensor module 1 in a dynamic random access memory (DRAM) 4<br>
and transfer the stored digital image data to a digital signal processor (DSP) 3 for<br>
image preprocessing. The first DMAC 2 is further adapted to store the results<br>
processed by the DSP 3 in the DRAM 4. Namely, the first DMAC 2 controls the<br>
input and output of data to/from the DRAM 4 via a bus. A second DMAC 5<br>
functions to control the input and output of data between a radio frequency (RF)<br>
module 13 and a main processor unit (MPU) 7.<br>
The DSP 3 is adapted to perform a preprocessing operation for the digital image<br>
data transferred by the first DMAC 2 so that the transferred digital image data can<br>
be recognized as a numeral. Namely, the DSP 3 removes noise components from<br>
the received digital image data and rapidly and effectively calculates the<br>
resulting digital image data to extract a shape, line segments and coordinate values<br>
necessary to numeral recognition therefrom. Then, the DSP 3 stores the calculated<br>
results in the DRAM 40 under the control of the first DMAC 2. A bus controller 6 is<br>
connected to the bus to control an internal data transfer rate.<br>
An optical character reader module 8, which recognizes numerals from a<br>
numeral image signal inputted through the image sensor module 1 and generates<br>
corresponding numeral codes, includes the DSP 3, the MPU 7 and the large-scale<br>
DRAM 4.<br>
The DRAM 4 is adapted to store and output the digital image data<br>
corresponding to the electrical image signal from the image sensor module 1. The<br>
DRAM 4 is further adapted to store the result data from the DSP 3, load a<br>
recognition algorithm coded in an electrically erasable and programmable read only<br>
memory (EEPROM) 9 therein and output the stored result data and the loaded<br>
recognition algorithm to the MPU 7 for recognition calculation of the digital image<br>
data. Namely, the DRAM 4 supports the image sensor module 1, the DSP 3 and<br>
the MPU 7 in common.<br>
Software with a high recognition rate is programmed in a desktop computer<br>
and then transferred to the EEPROM 9 in a hardware coding manner. The<br>
EEPROM 9 is an external nonvolatile memory acting to transfer a program stored<br>
therein to the DRAM 4 in response to a request from the MPU 7.<br>
A flash ROM 11 acts to store an integrated numeral, recognized and<br>
encoded by the MPU 7, under the control of the second DMAC 5. The flash ROM<br>
11 further stores information, transmitted from a meter reading center 16 and<br>
decoded by a command decoder 10, and transfers the stored information to a<br>
synchronous time controller 12. Namely, the flash ROM 11 stores an identification<br>
(ID) code, meter reading time information and an integrated numeric<br>
code and transfers them to the RF module (for example, a radio pico cell<br>
module or bluetooth module) 13 in response to a transmission request.<br>
The MPU 7 is adapted to perform a calculation operation for the results<br>
processed by the DSP 3 and a recognition library, loaded from the EEPROM 9 to<br>
the DRAM 4, and encode the resulting recognition numeral. Further, the MPU 7<br>
checks a synchronous time of the synchronous time controller 12, encodes a meter<br>
reading time in accordance with the checked result and stores the resulting meter<br>
reading time code in the flash ROM 11 via the command decoder 10.<br>
The synchronous time controller 12 is adapted to control the time of supply<br>
of power from a power supply 15 to associated components, or the RF module 13<br>
and optical character reader module 8, in response to a meter reading time code<br>
transmitted from the meter reading center 16, decoded by the command decoder 10.<br>
In other words, the synchronous time controller 12 is normally in a sleep mode to<br>
supply no power from the power supply 15, and proceeds to an awake mode upon<br>
receiving a meter reading time code transmitted from the meter reading center 16, to<br>
supply power from the power supply 15 to the optical character reader module 8<br>
only for a time period (for example, one to two minutes) designated by the received<br>
meter reading time code. Also in the awake mode, the synchronous time controller<br>
12 supplies the power from the power supply 15 to the RF module 13 only for a<br>
time period (for example, one to two hours) designated by a received command<br>
code. Further, for accurate transmission and reception synchronization, the<br>
controller 12 sets the standard time to time information, transmitted from the meter<br>
reading center 16 to the RF module 13, and interacts with the MPU 7 to generate a<br>
meter read time code and transmit it to the meter reading center 16.<br>
The command decoder 10 is adapted to decode codes from the MPU 7, RF<br>
module 13 and synchronous time controller 12 and store the decoded results in the<br>
flash ROM 11. An identification (ID) generator 14 is adapted to generate an<br>
ID code (including an address and ID number) of the associated integrating<br>
meter, thereby enabling the meter reading center 16 to accurately transmit numeric<br>
data wirelessly to a desired integrating meter.<br>
Although in the embodiment of the present invention the command decoder<br>
10 is described as being separately provided, it is desirable that all the functions of<br>
the command decoder 10 are implemented by the MPU 7.<br>
The power supply 15 includes a rechargeable battery for supplying a drive<br>
voltage to the optical character reader module 8 and RF module 13. The<br>
rechargeable battery may preferably be a hydrogen battery or thin-film lithium<br>
battery. The synchronous time controller 12 automatically monitors the level of<br>
output pov/er from the battery and the amount of charges stored on the battery. In<br>
the present invention, power is consumed only for the operation of the optical<br>
character reader module 8 for image recognition and the communication with the<br>
meter reading center 16. In this regard, the power supply 15 need not always remain<br>
"ON" and its life can thus be maintained for two to five years or more.<br>
The power supply 15 includes a rechargeable and replaceable battery, as<br>
stated previously. Alternatively, the power supply 15 may include a transparent<br>
solar cell as shown in Fig. 4a, an organic electrolyte solar cell as shown in Fig. 4b or<br>
an induced current source as shown in Fig. 4c. That is, a transparent solar cell 73<br>
may be attached on a casing 72 of an integrating meter 71, as shown in Fig. 4a, or<br>
an organic electrolyte solar cell 74 may be attached on a predetermined portion of<br>
the body of the integrating meter 71, as shown in Fig. 4b. In either case, the solar<br>
cell is suitable for an outdoor integrating meter in that it requires heat from the sun.<br>
Current may be induced in an induction coil 77 facing a coil 76 extending from a<br>
power line 75, as shown in Fig. 4c. This induced current is useable in spaces<br>
receiving no sunshine, such as underground, as well as outdoors.<br>
On the other hand, an integrating meter 91 may be installed in<br>
a communication dead zone such as underground, as shown in Fig. 5. In this<br>
case, the integrating meter 91 can be connected to an outdoor RF module 97 over<br>
power line communication. The RF module 97 can transfer data between the<br>
integrating meter 91 and a meter reading center. To this end, a transmission module<br>
93 must be provided in the integrating meter 91 including an image sensor module<br>
92, and a reception module 96 must be provided in the RF module 97. The RF<br>
module 97 is coupled with a receptacle 95 of a power line 94 in such a way that it<br>
can readily be decoupled therefrom with no separate work. Figs. 6a and 6b illustrate<br>
different embodiments of a power communication system for placing data regarding<br>
an integrated amount on a power line and extracting the data from the power line. In<br>
the power communication system of Fig. 6a, a pair of induction coils 78 and 81<br>
connected to a power line 79 are installed respectively in an integrating meter and<br>
an RF module. Alternatively, in the power communication system of Fig. 6b, input<br>
and output terminals of an RF module and integrating meter are connected to a<br>
power line 80 respectively via capacitors 82 and 83. These two systems can<br>
selectively be used according to the conditions of an integrating meter and RF<br>
module.<br>
In either system, a filter is provided to filter the integrated amount data<br>
transmitted over the power line communication, so as to prevent unnecessary<br>
components from being transmitted.<br>
On the other hand, a plurality of integrating meters 90-98 may be grouped<br>
into a single unit in a given area, as shown in Fig. 7. In this case, image sensor<br>
modules and RF modules 100-108 paired therewith are installed respectively in the<br>
integrating meters in such a manner that one RF module 100 is a master and the<br>
other RF modules 101-108 are slaves. With this construction, the master RF module<br>
can unify numeric data regarding integrated amounts of the respective integrating<br>
meters and transmit the unified data to a meter reading center over one<br>
communication line.<br>
Each RF module (for example, a bluetooth module or radio pico cell<br>
module) for data communication with the meter reading center acts to support a<br>
one-to-one or one-to-multiple wireless connection of an associated device to a<br>
variety of equipment existing within a given range. This RF module employs an<br>
industrial scientific medical (ISM) band of 2.4GHz to provide a transmission rate of<br>
a maximum of IMbps, a hop transceiver technology to reduce effects resulting from<br>
a fading interference, and a binary frequency modulation system.<br>
This RF module can be provided in a variety of digital equipment including<br>
mobile telephones, notebooks, printers, desktop personal computers, personal digital<br>
assistants, facsimiles, keyboards, joysticks, etc. to perform voice and data<br>
communications among the digital equipment using a radio frequency, not via a<br>
physical cable.<br>
A two-way data transmission/reception terminal, such as an interactive<br>
pager or a two-way messenger (TWM), may be provided to perform the<br>
transmission and reception of data between the RF module and the meter reading<br>
center. As an alternative, a data network-based cellemetry system, such as a<br>
personal communication service (PCS) system, a code division multiple access<br>
(CDMA) system, a time division multiple access (TDMA) system or a global<br>
system for mobile communication (GSM), may be provided to perform the<br>
transmission and reception of data between the RF module and the meter reading<br>
center.<br>
Next, a detailed description will be given of the operation of the wireless<br>
remote reading system with the above-stated construction in accordance with the<br>
present invention with reference to a flowchart of Fig. 8.<br>
First, the synchronous time controller 12 in the integrating meter analyzes a<br>
meter reading command transmitted from the meter reading center 16. If the<br>
transmitted command is analyzed to command the change from the sleep<br>
mode to the awake mode, the synchronous time controller 12 controls the power<br>
supply 15 to supply power to the optical character reader module 8 in which a<br>
character recognition library is stored (S1).<br>
The command transmitted from the meter reading center 16 includes a<br>
command code for instructing the associated integrating meter to perform an image<br>
pickup operation, and an ID code for designating the associated integrating meter.<br>
As a result, the meter reading center 16 can designate a specific integrating meter to<br>
be wirelessly and remotely read, by transmitting a specific command code to the<br>
meter.<br>
Upon being energized by the power supply 15, the image sensor module 1<br>
scans a numeral on the display of the integrating meter. Digital image data of the<br>
scanned numeral is stored in the DRAM 4 and then transferred to the DSP 3, which<br>
removes noise components from the transferred digital image data and performs a<br>
preprocessing operation for the resulting digital image data to extract a shape, line<br>
segments and coordinate values necessary to numeral recognition therefrom. Then,<br>
the DSP 3 digitizes the digital image data on the basis of the extracted shape, line<br>
segments and coordinate values (S2).<br>
A recognition library stored in the EEPROM 9 is transferred to the MPU 7<br>
via the DRAM 4. The MPU 7 compares the results processed by the DSP 3 with the<br>
recognition library loaded from the EEPROM 9, encodes the resulting recognition<br>
numeral and stores the resulting numeric code in the flash ROM 11 (S3). At the<br>
same time as storing the numeric code, the MPU 7 checks a meter reading time of<br>
the synchronous time controller 12 and stores the resulting meter reading time code<br>
and ID code in the flash ROM 11 (S4).<br>
The synchronous time controller 12 checks a transmission code for data<br>
transmission and reception under the condition that the power supply 15 is in<br>
the sleep mode to maintain the optical character reader module 8 at its OFF<br>
state. At the moment that a standby time command code for data transmission and<br>
reception of the RF module 13 is in accord with a synchronous time, the<br>
synchronous time controller 12 controls the power supply 15 to maintain the RF<br>
module 13 at its ON state for a command time period. As a result, the RF module<br>
13 remains at a transmission/reception standby state for the command time period<br>
(S5).<br>
Upon receiving meter reading and transmission command codes from the<br>
meter reading center 16 at the transmission/reception standby state, the RF module<br>
13 transmits the stored integrated numeric code or meter reading time code to the<br>
meter reading center 16 synchronously with a designated time (S6).<br>
The numeric code, transmitted from the integrating meter to the meter<br>
reading center via the RF module, includes numeric data regarding an integrated<br>
amount and an ID code indicative of the integrating meter. As a result, the meter<br>
reading center analyzes the numeric code transmitted from the integrating meter<br>
and, in accordance with the analyzed result, not only calculates a rate of the<br>
integrated amount but also charges the calculated rate to a subscriber to which the<br>
integrating meter belongs.<br>
Also, upon receiving a code signal from the meter reading center 16 at the<br>
standby state, the command decoder 10 decodes the received code signal and stores<br>
the decoded result in the flash ROM 11. The synchronous time controller 12 waits<br>
for meter reading and transmission/reception command codes and synchronous time<br>
information from the meter reading center in the slip mode (S7).<br>
Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the above-described wireless<br>
remote meter reading system and method are enough to accomplish the objects of<br>
the present invention.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
As apparent from the above description, the present invention provides a<br>
system and method for wireless automatic meter reading which can wirelessly and<br>
remotely read integrated amounts of consumed electric power, water, gas and the<br>
like. The wireless remote reading system is capable of being simply attached or<br>
mounted to the meters without replacing the meters with new ones, to perform a<br>
wireless remote reading operation. Further, numerals of the integrating meters are<br>
not hidden so that a manual reading operation can be performed at any time. The<br>
wireless remote reading system is mountable to all types of integrating meters<br>
including electric power meters, water meters, gas meters and the like to wirelessly<br>
and remotely read integrated amounts from the integrating meters. Moreover, the<br>
wireless remote reading system need not be subjected to a verification for a lengthy<br>
period of time and the product thereof is small in size and low in cost.<br>
Further, according to this invention, power is supplied only when the<br>
wireless remote reading operation is required, thereby lengthening the lifetime of,<br>
for example, a battery. Moreover, the wireless remote reading system can calculate<br>
local or national integrated amounts in a specific time zone, for example, the<br>
maximum load power time zone within a short time period and totally manage the<br>
integrated amounts. This has the effect of actively, rapidly and accurately coping<br>
with consumed amounts of electric power, water, gas and the like.<br>
Furthermore, according to this invention, the wireless remote reading<br>
system can unify integrated amounts of a group of integrating meters into one data<br>
unit and transmit the unified data unit over one communication line, thereby<br>
significantly reducing an occupancy duration and communication amount of the<br>
communication line. Also, the wireless remote reading system can transmit and<br>
receive data necessary to the wireless remote reading operation over power<br>
line communication, thereby performing the wireless remote reading operation<br>
irrespective of the positions of the integrating meters.<br>
Although the preferred embodiments of the present invention have been<br>
disclosed for illustrative purposes, those skilled in the art will appreciate that<br>
various modifications, additions and substitutions are possible, without departing<br>
from the scope and spirit of the invention as disclosed in the accompanying claims.<br>
