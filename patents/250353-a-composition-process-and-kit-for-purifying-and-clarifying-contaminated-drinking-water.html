				<td>WATER TREATMENT COMPOSITIONS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to compositions, methods and kits for use in the purification<br>
of contaminated drinking water for purposes of rendering it potable. The compositions<br>
and kits are especially designed for personal or domestic use in the batchwise purification<br>
and clarification of relatively small predetermined volumes of contaminated drinking<br>
water. The compositions and kits are also designed for personal or domestic use in the<br>
purification and nutrification of contaminated drinking water<br>
BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION<br>
There is a need for potable water in all areas of the world In developed countries, water<br>
is purified and potable water is supplied on a large scale, typically by large national or<br>
multinational water management companies. This water is typically supplied directly to<br>
the consumers homes in a potable form. However, in some parts of the world, for<br>
example in some rural areas of developing countries, many people either do not have a<br>
direct water supply to their homes and only have access to a non-potable communal water<br>
supply such as a village well, or cannot be guaranteed that the water they do receive is<br>
potable. As a result, considerable numbers of people die each year as the direct result of<br>
drinking contaminated drinking water. Thus, there is a need for water purification kits<br>
and compositions that allow the consumer to purify their own water, which produces<br>
potable water in a fast and efficient manner.<br>
Current water purification compositions available on the market to date, consist mainly of<br>
disinfectants, e.g. sources of chlorine and/or iodine, and do not adequately purify water.<br>
Water which is obtained after treatment by these water purification kits, may still<br>
comprise amounts of water impurities, e.g. heavy metal ions such as arsenic, which, when<br>
continually consumed for a prolonged period of time, may lead to health problems. Thus,<br><br>
there is a need to provide a water purification composition which removes water-<br>
impurities like heavy metal ions including arsenic and lead, more efficiently and<br>
effectively than current water purification kits.<br>
It has now been found that water purification compositions based on certain combinations<br>
of inorganic coagulants and water-soluble or water-dispersible polymers remove greater<br>
amounts of water impurities, such as heavy metals, from water compared to current water<br>
purification compositions.<br>
Also, current water purification compositions do not adequately remove, kill or inactive<br>
micro-organisms such as bacteria, viruses and cysts, which are present in the water. Thus,<br>
mere remains a need to provide a water purification composition which does adequately<br>
remove, kill or inactive these micro-organisms.<br>
It has now been found that when the composition of the present invention comprises a<br>
disinfecting agent, the composition removes, kills or inactivates a surprisingly larger<br>
amount of micro-organisms such as bacteria, viruses and cysts compared to water<br>
purification compositions known in the art<br>
In addition, the water which is to be purified by a water purification composition<br>
typically comprises a large amount of water-soluble organic content such as humic acid.<br>
With current water purification compositions, bleach, especially chlorine based bleach,<br>
can react with the water-soluble organic content and produce by-products in the water,<br>
including chlorine derivatives such as chloroacetic acid or chloroform, which are harmful<br>
to human and animal health. Thus, there is a need to provide water purification<br>
compositions, methods and kits which produce purified water comprising a low amount<br>
of disinfection by-products.<br>
Another problem associated with the use of certain chlorine-based disinfectants such as<br>
calcium hypochlorite is that of product stability. In particular, it has been found that<br>
known compositions based on calcium hypochlorite can lose substantial disinfection<br><br>
efficacy under regular conditions of storage and use. Thus, there is a need for<br>
purification and disinfection compositions having improved storage stability.<br>
After purification and disinfection of contaminated drinking water, there raises the further<br>
problem of maintaining the purity of the water until such time as it is required for<br>
drinking, whilst at the same time providing drinking water of satisfactory taste. Thus<br>
there is a need for compositions, methods and kits for purifying contaminated drinking<br>
water and which provides purified water having both longer life and improved taste<br>
attributes.<br>
In addition to the need for purifying and clarifying contaminated drinking water, there is<br>
also a huge need in many parts of the world to improve standards of nutrition and health.<br>
The effective provision of both clean water and essential minerals and vitamins would<br>
clearly be of universal benefit but especially so in those parts of the world where potable<br>
water is in short supply. Thus there is a need for compositions, methods and kits for<br>
purifying and at the same time nutrifying contaminated drinking water.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to compositions, methods and kits for purifying and/or<br>
clarifying contaminated drinking water, as well as to compositions, methods and kits for<br>
purifying and nutrifying contaminated drinking water. In general terms, the compositions<br>
herein comprise at least a primary coagulant material and a so-called bridging flocculent<br>
material, the levels and ratios of coagulant to flocculent preferably falling within certain<br>
ranges. Highly preferred compositions also contain one or more of a coagulant aid, a<br>
microbiocidal disinfectant, a water-soluble alkali, a water-insoluble silicate (for example<br>
a clay, zeolite or mixture thereof), and a food additive or nutrient source.<br>
According to a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a composition for purifying<br>
and clarifying contaminated drinking water and which comprises a primary coagulant, a<br>
bridging flocculant and a coagulant aid.<br><br>
In preferred embodiments, the primary coagulant is selected from the group consisting of<br>
water-soluble, multivalent inorganic salts and mixtures thereof, for example, iron<br>
sulphate, iron chloride, aluminium chloride, aluminium sulphate, manganese sulphate,<br>
manganese chloride, copper sulphate, copper chloride, poly- variations thereof, and<br>
mixtures thereof. Generally, the compositions herein comprise from about 10% to about<br>
99%, preferably from about 15% to about 50%, more preferably from about 25% to about<br>
40% by weight of the primary coagulant<br>
The bridging flocculant on the other hand is preferably a high molecular weight water-<br>
soluble or water-dispersible polymer or mixture of polymers having a weight average<br>
molecular weight of at least about 2,000,000, more preferably at least about 5,000,000<br>
and especially at least about 15,000,000. Bridging flocculents preferred for use herein are<br>
selected from the group consisting of water-soluble and water-dispersible anionic and<br>
nonionic polymers and mixtures thereof. Generally, the compositions herein comprise<br>
from about 0.1% to about 10%, preferably from about 0.2% to about 5%, more preferably<br>
from about 0.5% to about 3% by weight of the bridging flocculent<br>
The term 'coagulant aid' herein refers to a water-soluble or water-dispersible polymer of<br>
lower molecular weight than that of the bridging flocculant and which aids the overall<br>
aggregation and flocculation process. The coagulant aid preferred for use herein is a low<br>
molecular weight, water-soluble or water-dispersible polymer which generally has a<br>
weight average molecular weight of less than about 1,500,000, preferably less than about<br>
750,000 and especially less than about 300,000 and mixtures thereof. Generally the<br>
compositions herein comprise from about 0.1% to about 10%, preferably from about<br>
0.5% to about 5%, more preferably from about 1% to about 4% by weight of the<br>
coagulant aid.<br>
Although suitable coagulant aids include anionic polymeric hydrophilic colloids such as<br>
the carboxymethylcelluloses, highly preferred from the viewpoint of delivering excellent<br>
heavy metal, total soluble organic and cyst reduction performance are coagulant aids<br>
selected from the group consisting of water-soluble and water-dispersible cationic<br>
polymers and mixtures thereof, for example cationic polysaccharides of which chitosan is<br><br>
especially preferred. Preferred coagulant aids herein are substantially water-insoluble,<br>
having at least 10% by dry total weight of undissolved material as determined by the test<br>
described herein below, this being preferred from the viewpoint of providing<br>
compositions and methods delivering low total water-soluble organic content<br>
The weight ratio of primary coagulant to bridging flocculant herein is preferably from<br>
about 10:1 to about 200:1, more preferably from about 10:1 to about 150:1, yet more<br>
preferably from about 20:1 to about 100:1, and especially from about 25:1 to about 75:1,<br>
these ratios being valuable especially in conjunction with the levels of coagulant and<br>
flocculant described herein above for providing optimum purification performance in<br>
highly contaminated water conditions and for providing significantly improved rates of<br>
filtration and 'non-blocking' filter characteristics as well as excellent final product purity<br>
and clarity using paper and non-woven filters. Although the reasons for this<br>
improvement in filtration rate, non-blocking characteristics and product clarity are not<br>
fully understood, it is believed that higher levels and ratios of the bridging flocculant<br>
relative to the coagulant increases the 'stickiness' of the flocs with a consequent<br>
reduction in colloidal particulates. Such compositions are also highly suitable for use<br>
herein in conjunction with cloth filters.<br>
Thus, according to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a composition for<br>
purifying and clarifying contaminated drinking water and which comprises a primary<br>
coagulant selected from the group consisting of water-soluble, multivalent inorganic salts<br>
and mixtures thereof; a water-soluble or water-dispersible polymeric bridging flocculant<br>
wherein the weight ratio of primary coagulant to bridging flocculant is from about 10:1 to<br>
about 150:1, preferably from about 20:1 to about 100:1, and more preferably from about<br>
25:1 to about 75:1; and optionally a water-soluble or water-dispersible polymeric<br>
coagulant aid The filtration characteristics of the composition can be assessed using a<br>
standard filtration test and are preferably such that at least one litre of treated model<br>
surface water after treatment with 620mg/litre of purification composition passes a<br>
Whatman 1.2µm GF/C grade filter in less than 1 hour, preferably less than 45 minutes,<br>
and more preferably less than 30 minutes under ambient temperature conditions (20°C)<br><br>
and that at least 1 litre, preferably at least 2 litres, more preferably at least 3 litres of the<br>
treated water will pass the filter without blocking.<br>
The model surface water described comprises:<br>
(i) 24mg/l humic acid - source of soluble natural organic matter,<br>
(ii) 20mg/1 fine test dust(l -3 urn)- designed to add turbidity;<br>
(iii) 1500mg/l salt - to give stress conditions of high total dissolved solids.<br>
The resultant water has a high organic content (&gt;10mg/l total organic content (TOC),<br>
high colour (&gt;300 platinum cobalt units (PCU)), high turbidity (&gt;15 nephelometric<br>
turbidity units (NTU)) and high total dissolved solids (TDS). The pH of the water is near<br>
neutral but can also be adjusted to pH 5 or 9 using HC1 or NaOH respectively for stress<br>
testing. This water is referred to herein as 'model surface water'.<br>
Compositions having optimum purification and clarification performance can also be<br>
defined by reference to the weight ratio of the primary coagulant and coagulant aid to the<br>
bridging flocculant Thus, in preferred embodiments, the weight ratio of primary<br>
coagulant to coagulant aid is from about 8:1 to about 100:1, preferably from about 12:1 to<br>
about 30:1, and more preferably from about 15:1 to about 25:1. The weight ratio of<br>
coagulant aid to bridging flocculant, on the other hand, is preferably in the range from<br>
about 10:1 to about 1:6, preferably from about 5:1 to about 1:3, more preferably from<br>
about 3:1 to about 1:1.<br>
The compositions, methods and kits of the invention also preferably comprise a<br>
microbiocidal disinfectant Although a broad range of microbiocidal disinfectants are<br>
envisaged for use herein, preferred is a chlorine-based disinfectant Calcium hypochlorite<br>
is especially preferred Preferably, the compositions herein comprise primary coagulant<br>
and microbiocidal disinfectant in a weight ratio of from about 10:1 to about 100:1, more<br>
preferably from about 12:1 to about 60:1, and especially from about 15:1 to about 40:1.<br>
Generally, the compositions herein comprise from about 0.2% to about 10%, preferably<br>
from about 0.5% to about 4%, more preferably from about 0.7% to about 2.5% by weight<br>
of the microbiocidal disinfectant.<br><br>
The compositions, methods and kits of the invention will also generally comprise a<br>
water-soluble alkali, this being valuable from the viewpoint of delivering an optimum in-<br>
use pH profile. In general terms, the levels of primary coagulant and alkali should be<br>
adjusted so as to provide a pH at in-use concentration (generally about 620 ppm of total<br>
composition) in the range from about 6.0 to 8.5, but preferably in the range from about<br>
6.0 to 7.0, this being preferred from the viewpoint of providing performance robustness to<br>
contaminated waters of differing contamination levels and types. To achieve the requisite<br>
pH levels, the weight ratio of primary coagulant to water-soluble alkali will generally be<br>
in the range from about 0.8:1 to about 3:1, preferably from about 0.9:1 to about 2.4:1, and<br>
more preferably from about 1:1 to about 2:1. Generally, the compositions comprise from<br>
about 10% to about 45%, preferably from about 15% to about 40%, more preferably from<br>
about 20% to about 35% by weight of the water-soluble alkali.<br>
The compositions, methods and kits of the invention can also include a water-insoluble<br>
silicate material such as a clay or zeolite which acts to aid the fiocculation process by<br>
acting as a seed particle or by promoting absorption or cation exchange of metal ions. In<br>
preferred embodiments, the weight ratio of primary coagulant to water-insoluble silicate<br>
herein is from about 0.3:1 to about 5:1, preferably from about 0.7:1 to about 2:1, and<br>
more preferably from about 0.8:1 to about 1.2:1. Generally, the compositions herein<br>
comprise from about 10% to about 80%, preferably from about 20% to about 50%, more<br>
preferably from about 25% to about 35% by weight of the water-insoluble silicate.<br>
The compositions and kits herein can utilized in a variety of forms and process types<br>
including batch and continuous, but preferably the composition is in unit dosage form and<br>
is used in the batchwise purification and clarification of a relatively small predetermined<br>
volume of contaminated drinking water. By relatively small volume is meant a volume<br>
of water typically required for immediate consumption in domestic or personal use, or<br>
which is required for short term storage and consumption. Typically, the compositions<br>
herein will be used for treating a volume of contaminated drinking water in the range<br>
from about 0.1 to about 100, preferably from about 0.5 to about 40, more preferably from<br>
about 5 to about 20 and especially from about 8 to about 13 litres. Unit dosage amounts<br>
of the composition, on the other hand, will generally range from about 50 to about 2000,<br><br>
preferably from about 100 to about 1000, more preferably from about 250 to about 750<br>
mg per litre of contaminated drinking water. Unit dosage forms suitable for use herein<br>
include tablets, compacts, extrudates, water-soluble single and multi-compartment<br>
pouches etc but preferred unit dosage forms are single and multi-compartment sachets<br>
comprising a unit dose of granular or powdered composition which is opened prior to use<br>
and the contents emptied into a predetermined quantity of contaminated drinking water.<br>
For the above purposes, highly preferred herein is a composition in unit dosage form<br>
comprising;<br>
(i) from about 15% to about 50%, preferably from about 25% to about 40% by weight of<br>
the primary coagulant;<br>
(ii) from about 0.2% to about 5%, more preferably from about 0.5% to about 3% by<br>
weight of the bridging flocculent; and<br>
(iii) from about 0.5% to about 5%, more preferably from about 1% to about 4% by weight<br>
of the coagulant aid.<br>
It is also important to ensure that in-use of the compositions, effective levels of the<br>
formulation ingredients are delivered to the sample of contaminated water to be purified.<br>
Thus the levels of primary coagulant, bridging flocculant and coagulant aid in<br>
composition should preferably be sufficient to provide by weight of the contaminated<br>
drinking water from about 50 to about 500, preferably from about 75 to about 300, more<br>
preferably from about 100 to about 250 ppm of primary coagulant, from about 1 to about<br>
15, preferably from about 2 to about 10, more preferably from about 2.5 to about 7.5 ppm<br>
of bridging flocculant, and from about 1 to about 25, preferably from about 5 to about 20,<br>
more preferably from about 8 to about 12 ppm of coagulant aid.<br>
In preferred embodiments, the microbiocidal disinfectant is incorporated in the<br>
compositions of the invention in a controlled, delayed, sustained or slow release form<br>
whereby the disinfectant is released into the drinking water and allowed to react with<br>
soluble organic impurities therein only after substantial completion of the coagulation and<br>
flocculation stage, this being valuable from the viewpoint of controlling and rninimising<br>
the level of trihalomethanes (THM) generated during the purification process. A measure<br><br>
of the rate of release of disinfectant herein is tmax this being the time taken to achieve<br>
maximum residual disinfectant concentration after addition of the composition to<br>
deionized water at 20°C with gentle stirring. Preferably the compositions herein have a<br>
tmax of at least about 1 minute, preferably at least about 2 minutes, more preferably at<br>
least about 4 minutes, and especially at least about 8 minutes. The rate of coagulation<br>
and flocculation of organic impurities, on the other hand, is measured by the n%-ile<br>
soluble organic matter flocculation rate (tn). The n%-ile soluble organic matter<br>
flocculation rate is defined herein as the time taken for n% reduction in the concentration<br>
of humic acid as measured according to the procedure described hereinbelow. Preferably,<br>
tgo for the compositions herein is less than about 2 minutes, preferably less than about 1<br>
minute, more preferably less man about 30 seconds. In preferred embodiments,<br>
moreover, t90 for the compositions herein is less than about 2 minutes, preferably less than<br>
about 1 minute, more preferably less than about 30 seconds.<br>
Thus according to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a composition for<br>
purifying and clarifying contaminated drinking water and which comprises:<br>
(i) a primary coagulant selected from the group consisting of water-soluble, multivalent<br>
inorganic salts and mixtures thereof;<br>
(ii) a water-soluble or water-dispersible polymeric bridging fiocculant; and<br>
(iii) a microbiocidal disinfectant; and wherein the microbiocidal disinfectant is in<br>
controlled, delayed, sustained or slow release form whereby the composition has a tmax<br>
corresponding to the time for achieving maximum disinfectant concentration after<br>
addition to deionized water at 20°C which is greater than the 80%-ile soluble organic<br>
flocculation rate (t80) of the composition and more preferably greater than the 90%-ile<br>
soluble organic flocculation rate (t90) of the composition.<br>
Preferably tmax is at least about 1 minute, more preferably at least about 2 minute, even<br>
more preferably at least about 4 minutes and especially at least about 8 minutes greater<br>
than t80 and preferably greater than t90<br>
The n%-ile organic matter flocculation rate is measured on the model surface water<br>
described herein above. 620mg of the water-purification composition is added to a 1 litre<br><br>
sample of the model surface water with stirring. Aliquots of the liquid are then taken at<br>
30 second intervals, each aliquot being filtered through a 0.45um filter. The colour of the<br>
aliquot is then measured using for example a Hanna HI93727 colour meter and compared<br>
with a set of standards of known humic acid concentration and colour reading. The n%-<br>
ile soluble organic matter flocculation rate is the time taken to achieve a colour reading<br>
corresponding to a humic acid level which is (100-n)% of that of the initial level<br>
(24ppm).<br>
Preferably the final colour achieved (for example post-filtration at 30minutes) using the<br>
purification compositions of the invention either in-vivo or on model surface water is less<br>
than 20 PCU, more preferably less than 15 PCU and especially less than 10 PCU. The<br>
final turbidity achieved using the purification compositions of the invention either in-vivo<br>
or on model surface water, on the other hand, is preferably less than 5 NTU, more<br>
preferably less than 2 NTU and especially less than 1 NTU, turbidity being measured<br>
using a Jenway 6035turbidity meter calibrated daily against a 5.0 NTU standard.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, the disinfectant and water-purification composition can be<br>
used in separate treatment steps, either simultaneously or sequentially with one another.<br>
Preferably, the weight ratio of water-purification composition to disinfectant when used<br>
separately is from 10000:1, or preferably from 5000:1 or preferably from 1000:1, or<br>
preferably from 500:1, and preferably to 2:1, or preferably to 10:1, or preferably to 25:1,<br>
or preferably to 50:1, or preferably to 100:1.<br>
The compositions, methods and kits of the invention also preferably comprise a food<br>
additive or nutrient source, this being valuable from the viewpoint of providing drinking<br>
water which is not only pure but which also contains essential minerals and other food<br>
additives necessary for good health and nutrition. The food additive or nutrient source<br>
can be included in the kits of the invention as one or more separate compositions in unit<br>
dosage form, or they can be incorporated directly into the water-purification composition<br>
itself.<br><br>
Thus, according to a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a composition for<br>
purifying, clarifying and nutrifying contaminated drinking water and which comprises:<br>
(i) a primary coagulant selected from the group consisting of water-soluble, multivalent<br>
inorganic salts and mixtures thereof;<br>
(ii) a water-soluble or water-dispersible polymeric bridging flocculant; and<br>
(iii) a food additive or nutrient source.<br>
In the case of food additives and nutrient sources which are non-coagulable or which at<br>
least partially survive the coagulation and flocculation process, for example fluoridating<br>
agents, iodinating agents, and essential minerals such as zinc and iron, the food additive<br>
or flocculent can be incorporated without special measures into the water purification<br>
composition. Otherwise, the food additive or nutrient sources can also be incorporated in<br>
controlled, delayed, sustained or slow release form as described herein with respect to the<br>
disinfectant In this instance, the composition should have has a tmax corresponding to the<br>
time for achieving maximum nutrient concentration after addition to deionized water at<br>
20°C which is greater than the 80%-ile soluble organic flocculation rate (t80) and<br>
preferably greater than the 90%-iIe soluble organic flocculation rate (t90) of the<br>
composition.<br>
It is also desirable herein to control the free moisture content of the water-purification<br>
compositions, especially in those compositions of the invention comprising calcium<br>
hypochlorite as microbiocidal disinfectant. It should be understood that many of the<br>
ingredients of the compositions herein such as the bentonite clays, alum based<br>
coagulants, etc contain a natural amount of free moisture and this has been found to be<br>
especially detrimental to calcium hypochlorite stability. In preferred embodiments,<br>
therefore, the compositions of the invention should have a free-moisture content of less<br>
than about 6%, preferably less than about 4% and more especially less than about 2.5%<br>
by weight thereof. It is also highly desirable to incorporate one or more ingredients<br>
which are capable of acting as a moisture sink, for example, low-moisture, pre-dried<br>
clays and hydratable salts in anhydrous or partly hydrated form whereby the free moisture<br>
content of the composition is maintained below the theoretical amount necessary for<br>
100% hydration of the components of the composition. Particularly preferred moisture<br><br>
sinks include pre-dried clays and aluminosilicates, anhydrous sodium carbonate, and<br>
mixtures thereof. Preferably the moisture sinks have a free moisture content of less than<br>
about 4%, more preferably less than about 3%, especially less than about 2.5% and more<br>
especially less than about 1.5% by weight. Free moisture content of the product or<br>
moisture sink is determined as follows. A 2g sample of the product or moisture sink is<br>
extracted into 50 mls of dry methanol at room temperature for 20 mins. A 1 ml aliquot of<br>
this solution is then taken and the free moisture determined by a standard Karl Fischer<br>
titration. The free moisture is expressed as the percentage weight of water relative to the<br>
sample weight (in this case 2g).<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Primary Coagulant<br><br>
Primary coagulants suitable for use herein include water-soluble inorganic salts and<br>
mixtures thereof. 1a highly preferred embodiments, the composition herein comprises an<br>
inorganic metal salt selected from the group consisting of iron sulphate, iron chloride,<br>
manganese sulphate, manganese chloride, copper sulphate, copper chloride, aluminium<br>
sulphate, aluminium chloride, poly- variations thereof, and combinations thereof. The<br>
inorganic metal salt of the composition of the present invention is selected on the basis<br>
that it can act as a coagulant and can interact with charged water-soluble impurities in<br>
such a manner so as to neutralise the charge of said water-soluble impurity to form a<br>
water-insoluble impurity, usually to form a water-insoluble salt of said impurity, which<br>
precipitates out of solution. The inorganic salt of the composition of the invention can<br>
also lower the turbidity of the water by increasing the particle size of the water-insoluble<br>
impurities possibly causing sedimentation or facilitating the removal of these water-<br>
insoluble impurities by filtration or other water-insoluble matter removal techniques such<br>
as flotation or decanting. The inorganic salts selected herein, can also co-precipitate<br>
heavy metal ions out of water, and can also lower the total organic content present in the<br>
water by coagulating or adsorption of this organic content onto the water-insoluble<br>
impurities which have been formed in the water.<br>
Preferably the inorganic metal salt of the composition of the invention is a multivalent,<br>
preferably a di- or tri-valent, inorganic metal salt such as, aluminium III sulphate, iron II<br>
(ferrous) sulphate or iron III (ferric) sulphate. A most preferred inorganic metal salt for<br>
use herein is iron HI sulphate. The term "inorganic metal salt" includes all poly-<br>
variations thereof such as polyaluminum chloride and polyferric material, but does not<br>
include compounds comprising methyl or ethyl groups. The inorganic metal salt is<br>
preferably free of carbon atoms. The term "inorganic metal salts which are free of carbon<br>
atoms" includes sources of inorganic metal salts which comprise minor amounts of<br>
carbon impurity such as often found in naturally occurring inorganic metal salt sources.<br>
For example, preferred inorganic metal salts of the composition of the invention comprise<br>
(by weight of said salt) less than 5%, more preferably less than 3%, more preferably less<br>
than 1%, even more preferably less than 0.1%, even more preferably less than 0.01%<br>
carbon atoms.<br><br>
Particularly preferred are those inorganic metal salts which are a source of acid, such as<br>
aluminium HI sulphate or iron sulphate. This is especially true when the composition<br>
herein also comprises a source of carbonate such as sodium carbonate, since the acid<br>
source, and carbonate source, may react together to form a gas. This process is known as<br>
effervescence and helps to disperse the composition herein, especially when me<br>
composition herein is in the form of a tablet<br>
The composition herein preferably comprises (by weight) from 1%, or preferably from<br>
5%, or preferably from 10%, or preferably from 15%, or preferably from 20%, or<br>
preferably from 25%, and preferably to 50%, or preferably to 40%, or preferably to 30%<br>
inorganic salt selected from the group consisting of iron sulphate, iron chloride,<br>
manganese sulphate, manganese chloride, copper sulphate, copper chloride, aluminium<br>
sulphate, aluminium chloride, poly- variations thereof, and combinations thereof.<br>
Coagulant Aid<br>
The water purification composition herein preferably comprises a coagulant aid<br>
(sometimes referred to herein as 'first polymeric material'). Highly preferred are<br>
polymeric materials which comprises an amine group and which are therefore cationic in<br>
nature. The first polymeric material is selected on the basis that it can aid the coagulation<br>
and fiocculation process and in particular can in conjunction with the primary coagulant<br>
aid particle adherence and me aggregation of water-insoluble particles into larger water-<br>
insoluble aggregated complexes known as flocs. The first polymeric material may also<br>
adsorb or coagulate oils, fats and other organic or inorganic matter, and may sequester<br>
heavy metal ions.<br>
The term "amine group" is defined herein as including primary amine groups, secondary<br>
amine groups, tertiary amine groups, quaternary amine groups such as quaternary<br>
ammonium groups, but the term "amine group" does not include amide groups. Said<br>
amine group can be the group linking the monomelic units of the backbone of the<br>
polymeric material, or may be present as a side group of the polymeric material, for<br><br>
example as an amine side group of a polysaccharide. Preferably the amine group is<br>
present as a side group.<br>
Preferably, the polymeric material is substantially water-insoluble. "Substantially water-<br>
insoluble" is defined herein as having at least 10% by dry total weight of undissolved<br>
material present as determined by the following method:<br>
1g material is added to 1 litre of distilled water at a pH of between 6.0 and 8.0, at 20°C<br>
and stirred vigorously for 24 hours. The water is then filtered through a 3 micrometer<br>
filter, and the undissolved material which is collected by the filter step is dried at 80°C<br>
until constant weight, typically for 24 to 48 hours. The weight of this undissolved<br>
material is then determined and the % dry weight of this undissolved material can be<br>
calculated.<br>
The amine group of the first polymeric material is preferably at least partly protonated<br>
when the first polymeric material comes into contact with water, typically this<br>
protonation reaction occurs at a pH of below 9.0, and preferably at a pH of from 3 to 8.<br>
Thus, preferably the first polymeric material is cationic when in a solution of water at a<br>
pH of below 9. Alternatively, the amine group of the first polymeric material may already<br>
be in a charged state, for example a substituted or protonated state. The amine group of<br>
the first polymeric material may be a cationic quaternary ammonium group.<br>
The first polymeric material preferably comprises a polysaccharide comprising an amine<br>
group. The first polymeric material may comprise a cationic starch, for example, cationic<br>
starch obtained from potato starch, waxy maize starch, corn starch, wheat starch and rice<br>
starch. More preferably, the first polymeric material comprises a polysaccharide which<br>
comprises an amine group which is bound directly to the monomer saccharide backbone<br>
unit of said polysaccharide. More preferably the first polymeric material comprises a<br>
polymer of glucosamine where all the monomer saccharide backbone units are connected<br>
in a linear conformation via beta-l-4-glycosidic bonds. More preferably, the first<br>
polymeric material comprises a modified chitin, such as chitosan, modified chitosan, or<br>
salts thereof. Most preferably the first polymeric material comprises chitosan or modified<br><br>
chitosan. The first polymeric material may be an impurity of chitin, and therefore, chitin<br>
may be a preferred source of first polymeric material for use herein.<br>
Chitosan suitable for use herein is typically derived from the chitin of crustacea such as<br>
crabs, lobsters and shrimps. Chitosan derived from the chitin of fungi can also be used<br>
herein. The chitosan for use herein is typically found in the shells of Crustacea and can be<br>
extracted by any technique known in the art, for example by using the extraction<br>
techniques described in US3533940, US3862122, US3922260 and US4195175.<br>
The first polymeric material for use herein typically has an amine modification degree of<br>
at least 0.1, more preferably at least 0.2, or preferably at least 03, or preferably at least<br>
0.4, or preferably at least 0.5, or preferably at least 0.6, or preferably at least 0.7, or<br>
preferably at least 0.8, or preferably at least 0.9, or preferably at least 1.0. Said<br>
modification degree is an indication of the amount of amine groups present in the<br>
polymeric material and is defined as the number ratio of the number of amine groups<br>
present in the polymeric material per monomer unit of the polymeric material.<br>
Preferably, the first polymeric material has a weight average molecular weight of at least<br>
10000, or preferably at least 25000, or preferably at least 50000, or preferably at least<br>

substantially water-soluble at in-use concentrations and has a weight average molecular<br><br>
weight of at least about 100,000, preferably at least about 2000000. The second<br>
polymeric material is selected on the basis that it can act as flocculent and cause the<br>
aggregation of water-insoluble particles into larger water-insoluble aggregated complexes<br>
known as flocs. It is believed that the ability of the second polymeric material to act as a<br>
flocculent, is due to the combination of its high molecular weight, structure, and water-<br>
solubility properties.<br>
The second polymeric material is usually of greater molecular weight than the first<br>
polymeric material and preferably does not comprise an amine group. Preferably the<br>
second polymeric material comprises an amide group. More preferably the second<br>
polymeric material is a polyacrylamide. The second polymeric material is preferably not<br>
a canonic polyacrylamide, and preferably, the second polymeric material is not canonic.<br>

polyacrylamides for use herein are those from the Magnafloc range supplied by Ciba. Of<br>
these polyacrylamides, especially preferred are those known under the trade name as<br>
Magnafloc LT20, Magnafloc LT25, Magnafloc LT25S, Magnafloc LT26, Magnafloc<br>
LT28, Magnafloc 351 and Magnafloc 919.<br>
It is preferred that a low amount of substantially water-soluble organic content is present<br>
in the composition herein. The term "low amount of substantially water-soluble content"<br>
can be determined by the following method:<br>
500mg of said composition is added to 1 litre of deionised water which comprises no<br>
detectable amounts of substantially water-soluble organic content, to form a solution.<br>
Said solution is left with occasional stirring for 30 minutes and is then filtered through<br>
Whatman GF/C paper having an average pore size of 1.2 micrometers to obtain purified<br><br>
water. The level of total organic content (TOC) of said purified water is determined using<br>
the ISO method 8245:1999. A composition comprising "a substantially low amount of<br>
water-soluble content" is defined as a composition which gives a TOC of said purified<br>
water of less than 10ppm, preferably less than 7ppm, more preferably less than 4ppm<br>
when determined using this method<br>
It is also preferred that a low amount of substantially water-soluble organic content is<br>
obtained on use of the composition either in-vivo or on model surface water. For this<br>
purpose, 620 mg of the composition is added to 1 litre of in-vivo or model surface water<br>
respectively and the test repeated. Preferably, the TOC of the water after treatment is less<br>
man 10ppm, more preferably less than 7ppm, and especially less than 4ppm.<br>

coating the disinfecting agent with, for example, a poorly water-soluble or hydrophobic<br>
material, or providing a coating of sufficient thickness that the kinetics of dissolution of<br>
the coating provide delayed release. Poorly water-soluble or hydrophobic materials<br>
include waxes, paraffins, silicas, zeolites, clays, polymeric resins, celluloses, cross-linked<br>
polymers, insoluble salts such as calcium carbonate,, etc. The coating material can be<br>
applied by agglomeration in, for example, pan, rotary drum and vertical blenders, or by<br>
spray atomization. Other means for providing delayed release include mechanical means<br>
for altering the physical properties of the disinfecting agent, for example, compaction,<br>
granulation means for altering the particle size distribution of the disinfecting agent, etc.<br>

preferably from 1.0%, or preferably from 1.2%, or preferably from 1.5%, and preferably<br>
to 20%, or preferably to 10%, or preferably to 5%, or preferably to 4%, or preferably to<br>
2.5% disinfecting agent<br>
Water-Insoluble Silicate<br>
The composition herein preferably comprises a water-insoluble silicate selected from<br>
clays, zeolites and mixtures thereof.<br>
Highly preferred silicates for use herein are clays. The clay acts as a seed particle onto<br>
which water-insoluble impurities can aggregate to form flocs. The presence of clay in the<br>
composition improves the rate of floc formation and allows the formation of larger flocs<br>
compared to when clay is absent from the composition herein. The clay may also act as a<br>
swelling agent, and if the composition herein is in the form of a tablet, the clay improves<br>
the rate at which the tablet disintegrates on contact with water by swelling upon contact<br>
with water so that the components of the tablet are pushed apart by the swollen clay<br>
particles. The clay can also act as a desiccant within the tablet. The clay may also act as a<br>
canonic exchange agent to remove metal ions from the water and the clay can also<br>
remove colour, heavy metals and some organic material from water by adsorption.<br>
The clay is preferably a smectite clay, preferably a dioctahedral smectite clay such as<br>
montmorillonite clay or a trioctahedral smectite clay such as hectorite clay. Those clays<br>
found in bentonite clay deposits are also preferred. Particularly preferred clays for use<br>
herein include laponite clay, hectorite, montmorillonite, nontronite, saponite, volkonsite,<br>
sauconite, beidellite, allevarlite, illite, halloysite and attapulgite. In compositions<br>
containing calcium hypochlorite, the free moisture content of the clay should be carefully<br>
controlled to provide acceptable disinfectant stability. Preferably the free moisture<br><br>
content should be less than about 4%, more preferably less than about 3%, especially less<br>
than about 2.5% and more especially less than about 1.5% by weight Free moisture<br>
content is determined on a 2g sample of the test material following the procedure as<br>
described hereinabove.<br>
Highly preferred for use herein from the viewpoint of providing optimum disinfectant<br>
stability are pre-dried clays which in their dessicated form have the potential to scavenge<br>
or pick up moisture. Such clays can be described in terms of their so-called 'water-<br>
capacity', defined herein as the equilibrium weight percentage of moisture picked up by a<br>
small sample (e.g.10mg) of the dessicated material from air at 80% relative humidity and<br>
20°C as measured by dynamic vapour sorption techniques. For example, if 10mg of the<br>
dessicated clay picks up 2mg moisture, the dessicated clay has a water capacity of 20%.<br>
Preferred for use herein are dessicated clays having a water capacity of at least about<br>
10%, preferably at least about 15%, and more preferably at least about 18%.<br>
The composition herein preferably comprises (by weight) from 1%, or preferably from<br>
5%, or preferably from 10%, or preferably from 15%, or preferably from 20%, or<br>
preferably from 25%, and preferably to 80%, or preferably to 50%, or preferably to 35%<br>
clay.<br>
Aluminosilicates may be used herein in place of, or in addition to, clay. The<br>
aluminosilicate can act as a cationic exchange agent to remove metal ions from water,<br>
and can also act as a seed particle to enhance floc formation and as dessicant for<br>
enhancing disinfectant stability. Preferred aluminosilicates for use herein include zeolite<br>
A, zeolite X, zeolite Y, zeolite P and zeolite beta. Preferably the free moisture content of<br>
the aluminosilcate should be less than about 4%, more preferably less than about 3%,<br>
especially less than about 2.5% and more especially less than about 1.5% by weight<br>
Highly preferred for use herein from the viewpoint of providing optimum disinfectant<br>
stability are pre-dried aluminosilicates which in their dessicated form have the potential<br>
to scavenge or pick up moisture. Such dessicated aluminosilicates can also be described<br>
in terms of their so-called 'water-capacity', as defined hereinabove. Preferred for use<br><br>
herein are dessicated aluminsilicates having a water capacity of at least about 10%,<br>
preferably at least about 15%, and more preferably at least about 18%.<br>
The composition herein preferably comprises (by weight) from 1%, or preferably from<br>
5%, or preferably from 10%, or preferably from 15%, or preferably from 20%, or<br>
preferably from 25%, and preferably to 80%, or preferably to 50%, or preferably to 35%<br>
aluminosilicate.<br>
A third polymeric material<br>
The composition herein may comprise a third polymeric material. Said third polymeric<br>
material does not contain an amine group and is substantially water insoluble. The term<br>
"substantially water insoluble" is defined hereinbefore. Thus, the third polymeric material<br>
is different to, and is not, the first polymeric material or the second polymeric material.<br>
The third polymeric material is selected on the basis that it can act as a seed particle to<br>
enhance floc formation. The third polymeric material can be used in place of, or in<br>
addition to, clay or zeolite. Preferably the free moisture content of the third polymeric<br>
material should be less than about 4%, more preferably less than about 3%, especially<br>
less than about 2.5% and more especially less than about 1.5% by weight<br>
Preferably the third polymeric material comprises cellulose, more preferably the third<br>
polymeric material is an unmodified cellulose. Most preferably the third polymeric<br>
material comprises powdered cellulose.<br>
The composition herein preferably comprises (by weight) from 1%, or preferably from<br>
5%, or preferably from 10%, or preferably from 15%, or preferably from 20%, or<br>
preferably from 25%, and preferably to 80%, or preferably to 50%, or preferably to 35%<br>
third polymeric material.<br>
Alkali agent<br><br>
The composition herein may comprise an alkali agent The alkali agent can be any<br>
compound which gives alkalinity when contacted to water. The alkali agent for use herein<br>
is not a polymeric material. The composition herein preferably comprises an amount of<br>
alkali agent such that when the composition herein is contacted to water to form a<br>
solution, said solution has a pH of from 5 to 8, preferably from 6 to 7.<br>
Preferred alkali agents are selected from the group consisting of sodium carbonate,<br>
sodium bicarbonate, sodium hydroxide, sodium oxide, calcium carbonate, calcium<br>
bicarbonate, calcium hydroxide, calcium oxide, potassium carbonate, potassium<br>
bicarbonate, potassium hydroxide, potassium oxide and combinations thereof.<br>
Particular alkali agents which are a source of carbonate when contacted to water, for<br>
example sodium carbonate or sodium bicarbonate may be preferred for used herein. If the<br>
composition herein comprises a source of acid, for example an inorganic salt of the<br>
composition of the present invention such as iron sulphate, said alkali agent which is a<br>
source of carbonate can interact with said acid source in the presence of water to produce<br>
a gas. This process is known as effervescence, and improves the rate at which the<br>
composition disperses, especially when the composition herein is in the form of a tablet.<br>
Highly preferred herein, especially in compositions containing calcium hypochorite as<br>
disinfecting agent, are alkalis which can also act as moisture sinks, especially anhydrous<br>
sodium carbonate.<br>
The composition herein typically comprises (by weight) from 1% to 50%, preferably<br>
from 10%, or preferably from 15%, or preferably from 20%, or preferably from 25%, and<br>
preferably to 45%, or preferably to 40%, or preferably to 35% alkali agent<br>
Composition<br>
The composition herein is preferably in a solid unit dose form, most preferably in a tablet<br>
or powder form. The composition herein is preferably packaged so that it is protected<br>
from environmental conditions such as moisture. Preferably the composition herein is<br><br>
packaged in a water impermeable material such as polypropylene or typical laminates.<br>
An example of one such laminate is a laminate supplied by Akerlund &amp; Raus, comprising<br>
layers of coated paper (outer), LDPE, aluminium foil and an inner layer Surlyn (an<br>
ethylene/methacrylate co-polymer) - an FDA approved food packaging.<br>
Method for use<br>
The composition herein can be used to purify water using a method comprising the steps<br>
of (a) contacting the composition herein to water to obtain partially purified water<br>
comprising solid matter; and (b) removing at least part of said solid matter from said<br>
partially purified water by; (i) filtration; or (ii) decanting; or (iii) sedimentation; or (iv)<br>
flotation; or (v) a combination thereof, to obtain purified water.<br>
The composition herein can be in the form of a tablet or solid powder which is added to<br>
water, typically to form partially purified water comprising solid matter such as flocs.<br>
This solid matter can be removed or separated from the remaining part of the partially<br>
purified water by any technique, typically by filtration but decanting, sedimentation and<br>
flotation may also be used. By filtration it is meant passing the partially purified water<br>
through a filter. Filtration can occur by pouring means, for example by pouring said<br>
partially purified water through a filter to remove at least part of the solid matter from<br>
said partially purified water. Filtration can also occur by centripetal force means, for<br>
example by total enclosing the partially purified water by a filter and spinning said<br>
partially purified water and said filter so that said partially purified water passes through<br>
said filter and at least part of said solid matter is separated from said partially purified<br>
water. Filtration can also occur by plunging means, for example by plunging or moving a<br>
filter through said partially purified water so that at least part of said solid matter is<br>
separated from said partially purified water.<br><br>
Filters typically used include cloth filters, non-woven and paper filters and polishing<br>
filters, such as filters comprising activated carbon, glass fibre, zeolite, ion exchange<br>
media, or a combination thereof, which remove residual water-impurities, e.g. organic<br>
matter, heavy metal ions and residual disinfectant from the water. Filters suitable for use<br><br>
may be impregnated with silver or other biostatic components so that bacteria cannot<br>
grow on said filter and the filter can be reused several times without contaminating the<br>
water being filtered. Sand filters can also be used, and more than one filter may be used<br>
in combination herein.<br>
Preferably, from 10mg, or preferably from 50mg, or preferably from 75mg, or preferably<br>
from 100mg, or preferably from 150mg, or preferably from 200mg, or preferably from<br>
250mg, or preferably from 300mg, and preferably to 2000mg, or preferably to 1000mg,<br>
or preferably to 750mg of composition herein is added to 1 litre of water. The amount of<br>
composition herein which is added to the water depends on the impurity of said water.<br>
For example, less composition is needed to adequately purify water which is not very<br>
impure compared to the amount of composition herein which is needed to purify very<br>
impure water.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
In the above, the calcium hypochlorite was added in granular form comprising particles<br>
of about 1212µm median particle size with less than 25% by weight larger than 1400um,<br>
less than 0.5% by weight larger than 2000um and less than 3% by weight smaller than<br>
150µm. The free moisture content of the compositions was in the range from 1% to 4%.<br>
The hectorite clay, montmorillonite clay and zeolite X were all predried to a free moisture<br>
content below 1.5% by weight and had a water capacity in excess of 18%. The<br>
compositions have a tmax of at least about 8 minutes and a t80, of less than about 30<br>
seconds. 6.2g of compositions L to V were added in powder form from unit dose<br>
polypropylene sachets to 10 litres of water. The water was then agitated or stirred briefly.<br>
The water was left to stand for 5 minutes, after which said water was stirred or agitated<br>
for a further minute, left to stand for a further five minutes, after which said water was<br>
stirred or agitated for a further minute and then left to stand for another 5 minutes. During<br>
this time, water-insoluble flocs formed in the water. The liquid was then filtered through<br>
a cotton cloth or non-woven filter to remove said water-insoluble flocs, and the filtrate<br>
was collected. The filtrate was left for a further 15 minutes and is purified water.<br><br>
