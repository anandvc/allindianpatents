				<td>Field of the invention:<br>
The invention relates to protective relays for electric power systems in general<br>
and to a multifunction numerical line protection relay with interoperability<br>
between IEC 61850 compliant devices in particular, and also to a method for<br>
realization of IEC 61850 communication protocol in such a relay.<br>
Background and prior art:<br>
A new generation of microprocessor based Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs)<br>
with high speed peer to peer communication for protection and control is now<br>
becoming common in electric power industry. This has led to the necessity to<br>
standardize the communication protocol between the IEDs in substations and<br>
power stations, which resulted in the evolution of a universal platform based on<br>
an International Electro technical Commission (IEC) 61850 that will not only<br>
allow plug-and-play technology, but also ascertain interoperability between the<br>
IEDs of different vendors. The full implementation of the standard ensures open,<br>
 <br>
future-proof and flexible system architectures with state-of-art performances.<br>
IEC 61850 is becoming the widely accepted solution for communication within<br>
substations all over the world.<br>
One of great advantages provided by this standard is the real time<br>
communication for the high priority messages. Traditionally interconnection<br>
between the IEDs was made with wire by means of electrical circuit using<br>
communication interfaces and proprietary communication protocols. Technology<br>
today provides us with solution using an optical Ethernet network to perform far<br>
superior tasks in shorter time. The IEDs can now exchange status and control<br>
signals with other IEDs by exchanging data packets containing status and control<br>
signals over a communication link using Ethernet on the local area network. They<br>
can also send reports and logs, file transfer of disturbance records to clients.<br>
The benefits can be assessed in terms of new features for a better operation<br>
(automation), maintenance (access to more accurate data) and engineering (e.g.<br>
avoid data duplication) within the substation and also within the overall grid<br>
information scheme. Logical integration of the protection, control and<br>
communication features is to design the proper architectural mechanisms both at<br>
device and system levels to ensure a sustainable industrial model. A simple<br>
architecture, scalability and testability are important for market acceptance of<br>
IEC 61850 compliant IED.<br>
 <br>
A multifunction numerical line protection relay is known from Indian patent<br>
application no. 00575/KOL/2007, filed on 04.06.2007.<br>
The invention relates to protective relay for electric power systems, and more<br>
particularly relates to a method for realization of multifunction numerical line<br>
protection relay adopting a real-time operating system and a single processor.<br>
The multifunctional numerical line protection relay of the prior ait was a stand<br>
alone relay which did not have the interoperability feature. Increasing demand<br>
on protection relays for delivering higher level services, like high speed and<br>
accurate protection along with networking - for communication between peers,<br>
client and server; user interfaces and file system management - call for efficient<br>
integration of custom hardware and software resources. The present invention<br>
proposes a methodology of integrating the IEC 61850 communication protocol<br>
with the protection and control features of the multifunction line protection relay<br>
with the up-gradation of the device's firmware.<br>
Objects Of The Invention:-<br>
It is therefore an object of the invention to incorporate IEC 61850<br>
communication protocol in the Multifunction Numerical Line Protection Relay that<br>
has been designed with single processor architecture and a realtime operating<br>
 <br>
system, so as to achieve a significant increase in the communication capability<br>
for the state-of-art substation automation.<br>
Another object of invention is to provide a method of configuring the logical<br>
device, various logical nodes, data sets, control blocks (reports, logs and<br>
GOOSE).<br>
A further object of invention is to provide a client - server communication and<br>
peer-to-peer communication with Generic Object Oriented Substation Events<br>
(GOOSE) messages over the Ethernet.<br>
A still further object of the invention is to provide a method of inter process<br>
communication between the various realtime, non realtime applications and<br>
communication interface within the same intelligent electronic device.<br>
Yet another object of invention is to provide an easy and quick method for<br>
converting a non-IEC 61850 device (which is described in the prior art) to an IEC<br>
61850 compliant IED without an additional protocol converter or hardware.<br>
Moreover, the method depends on a simple change / upgrade of the firmware to<br>
make the relay IEC 61850 compliant.<br>
Summary Of The Invention:<br>
The present invention is concerned with substation automation (SA) systems, in<br>
particular with a methodology for implementing an IEC 61850 standard in a<br>
 <br>
Multifunction Numerical Line Protection Relay in order to make it IEC61850<br>
compliant Intelligent Electronic Device (IED). The IED is made IEC 61850<br>
compliant with the augmentation of the communication protocol with the<br>
features which are coded in the IED capability description (ICD) file.<br>
The invention proposes a unique method to incorporate IEC 61850<br>
communication protocol in a multifunction numerical protection relay. This has<br>
been achieved without any additional hardware and by integrating additional<br>
software with the existing software. More particularly, the invention relates to a<br>
method of implementation of IEC 61850 communication protocol in the<br>
multifunction numerical line protection relay.<br>
The present invention relates to a method used for configuring the various<br>
protection, non-protection functions as data models in the relay based on the<br>
IEC 61850 standards. The models that are configured in the relay are:<br>
Association model, Server / Logical device/Logical node/Data, Data set model,<br>
Substitution model, Setting Group model, Reporting model, Log model, Goose-<br>
Subscribe and Publish model, File transfer model, Time and time synchronization<br>
model.<br>
The relay is configured to record the performance statistics during the<br>
occurrence of a major disturbance or fault in substation in the form of<br>
Disturbance Records (DR) stored in the Common Format for Transient Data<br>
Exchange (COMTRADE). The relay is configured to perform as Simple Network<br>
 <br>
Time Protocol (SNTP) Client so that the polled time from a SNTP Server is<br>
accessed and the relay (Real Time Clock) RTC time is updated with the new<br>
time.<br>
The relay is a physical device with a communication interface. It has an IP<br>
address and is accessible over a network by an external client. It can access<br>
connection from one or more (maximum of 8) clients. It contains one logical<br>
device and several logical nodes that represent the basic building blocks<br>
(objects) of the functionality of the relay. Each logical node contains data that<br>
can be written to or read individually and in groups (data sets). It: also responds<br>
to control inputs or triggers control outputs;. It provides solicited and unsolicited<br>
reports, and contains logs that can be queried. Services are provided to read<br>
and write the data in the logical node. Measured data and status information are<br>
normally read only. Control and configuration information are generally read and<br>
write. The dataset which is a collection of data values that are commonly<br>
needed, is given a name, and clients can retrieve them with a single read<br>
operation.<br>

An exemplary embodiment of the invention as depicted in the accompanying<br>
drawings will now be described. However, there may be other embodiments of<br>
the same invention all of which are deemed covered by this description.<br>
The invention provides the method of implementation of the IEC 61850<br>
communication protocol in the multifunction numerical line protection relay<br>
incorporating the present invention. The numerical relay described in the prior-<br>
art shown in Fig.l can be configured as an IEC 61850 compliant IED (Fig.2) in<br>
the substation environment capable of interacting with the other substation<br>
devices which are also IEDs themselves. The data modeling in the relay has been<br>
done taking into account the functionality and data exchange requirements with<br>
the other substation devices. The various protection and non protection functions<br>
 <br>
of the relay are divided into the smallest entities called the logical nodes in the<br>
standard, which are used to exchange information. The logical nodes are<br>
modeled and defined from the conceptual application point of view in IEC 61850-<br>
5. In this implementation, the relay, which is a real device is modeled as a virtual<br>
model. A set of basic services have been defined which are used by the<br>
communication interface to accomplish the information exchange. These services<br>
referred to as Abstract Communication Service Interface (ASCI ) have been<br>
standardized as per the parts IEC 61850-7-1 &amp; IEC 61850-7-2. The<br>
communication is established through Transmission Control Protocol / Internet<br>
Protocol (TCP/IP) port available in the relay hardware. The relay which is<br>
configured as a server for the purpose of IEC 61850 communication, has the<br>
following models programmed in it.<br>
a) Association model - Association services is a basic requirement in order for a<br>
client to connect to the IEC 61850 compliant IED. There are three association<br>
services - Associate, Abort, and Release. The Basic Information Model with two<br>
party access control is available for bi-directional connection oriented information<br>
exchange between IEDs which is reliable and provides end-to-end flow control.<br>
The multicast and broadcast access control is available for unidirectional<br>
information exchange between one publisher and one or many subscribers. The<br>
 <br>
subscriber shall be able to detect loss and duplication of information received.<br>
The relay is capable of both publishing and subscribing to GOOSE<br>
messages.(304)<br>
b)	Server / Logical device / Logical node / Data model (303,305)- The server<br>
represents the external visible behaviour of the relay. It can communicate with<br>
clients, send information to peer devices. The logical device contains the<br>
information produced and consumed by a groyp of domain specific application<br>
functions. This is made up of several logical nodes - each for one domain<br>
specific application function. Data is the status and information of object it<br>
represents in the substation.<br>
c)	Data set model - This constitutes the group of data and data attributes<br>
collected from the various logical nodes that need to be sent with any of the<br>
services or as GOOSE messages. The server is configured for fixed data sets.<br>
d)	Substitution model - This provides a replacement of process value in the<br>
server with reference to the measurands of analogue values or status values of<br>
various digital signals.<br>
e)	Setting Group model - The relay has four setting groups with one set of<br>
 <br>
setting values as active and another as edit setting groups. Active and edit<br>
setting groups can be dynamically changed as per the need.<br>
f)	Reporting model - This describes the conditions for generating reports based<br>
on parameters set by the client. Reports may be sent immediately or deferred.<br>
Any data update, data change, quality change in the associated dataset or the<br>
integrity period triggers the formation of report and its onward transmission to<br>
the respective client.<br>
g)	Log model - Describes the conditions for generating logs based on the<br>
parameters set by the client. Logs can be queried for later retrieval.<br>
h) GOOSE -Subscribe and Publish model(304)- This supports a fast and reliable<br>
system-wide distribution of input and output data values. Simultaneous delivery<br>
of the same generic substation event information to more than one physical<br>
device through the use of broadcast services. This model is used for fast<br>
transmission of substation events such as commands, alarms and indications as<br>
messages. A single GOOSE message sent by an IED can be received by several<br>
receivers. This model makes use of the Ethernet and supports real-time<br>
behaviour.<br>
 <br>
j) File transfer model - The server defies the exchange of large data blocks such<br>
as programs and disturbance record files (DR) stored in the relay's memory. The<br>
DR files in the Common Format for Transient Data Exchange (COMTRADE)<br>
format are stored in the flash memory, under the folder YCOMTRADE' of the<br>
relay. The file directory service will give client, the list of files and /or directories<br>
mentioned in the request.<br>
k) Time and time synchronization model for SNTP - This enables the relay to<br>
accepts the UTC synchronized time over the local area network and reset its<br>
clock.<br>
Description Of The Relay<br>
Referring to Fig.l, the multifunction numerical line protection relay incorporating<br>
the present invention, is a powerful and compact multifunction numerical relay,<br>
configured for the protection of transmission lines. The relay is capable of<br>
handling the protection requirements of the transmission lines, and works based<br>
on the three phase currents and voltages. The relay is also IEC61850<br>
communication protocol compliant.<br>
 <br>
The entire application software is divided into real and non-real tasks wherein<br>
the real time tasks are repeated exactly with the same cyclicity as has been<br>
originally defined by the application. The non-real tasks on the other hand, are<br>
not time critical and run in the background. The real time tasks are handled by<br>
the RT (Real-time) module while the non-real time tasks are handled by NRT<br>
(Non-realtime) module. The relay software is designed and implemented such<br>
that it supports many features.<br>
It uses RT FIFOs (real time first in first out) as Inter Process Communication<br>
(IPC) mechanism for communication between RT module and NRT module. They<br>
act as pipes between the RT and NRT tasks.<br>
The multifunction line protection relay of the invention is configured to perform<br>
the following protection and non protection functions :<br>
PROTECTION FEATURES<br>
1. Phase and earthfault distance protection: Each with five independent<br>
zones of protection, four in the forward and one reverse direction: This is<br>
based on impedance, which is high during the normal operation, and,<br>
during fault condition, the impedance becomes less, and when it is<br>
 <br>
below the set value, trip command to the breaker is issued to isolate the<br>
fault.<br>
2.	Overcurrent protection: Two elements with direction control, with first<br>
element as either Inverse Definite Minimum Time (IDMT) or Definite Time<br>
(DT) and the second element as Hiset instantaneous. This is provided to<br>
limit damage from phase faults.<br>
3.	Earthfault protection: Two elements with directional control, with first<br>
element as either Inverse Definite Minimum Time (IDMT) or Definite Time<br>
(DT) and the second element as Hiset instantaneous. This is a protection<br>
scheme with the zero sequence component of the three phase currents.<br>
4.	Overvoltage protection: One element with selectable characteristics as<br>
either Inverse Definite Minimum Time (IDMT) or definite time (DT) for<br>
each of the three phase voltages.<br>
5.	Undervoltage protection: One element with selectable characteristics as<br>
either Inverse Definite Minimum Time (IDMT) or definite time (DT) for<br>
each of three phase voltages.<br>
6.	Negative sequence overcurrent protection. This element can provide<br>
backup protection for many unbalanced fault conditions.<br>
7.	Switch on to fault (SOTF) protection: This is provided for high speed<br>
clearance of any detected fault immediately after a manual circuit breaker<br>
closure.<br>
 <br>
8.	Trip on reclose protection (TOR): This is provided for high speed<br>
clearance of any detected fault immediately following autoreclose of the<br>
circuit breaker.<br>
9.	Power swing blocking: Selective blocking of distance protection zones<br>
ensures stability during power swings experienced on transmission<br>
systems.<br>
10.Voltage transformer supervision: This is to prevent wrong operation of<br>
voltage dependent protection on AC voltage input. It mainly detects<br>
voltage transformer fuse failures.<br>
11.Current transformer supervision: If one or any of the current transformers<br>
were to become open circuited, this protection raises an alarm.<br>
12.	Broken conductor: This is to detect: network faults such as open circuits,<br>
where a conductor may be disconnected and not in contact with another<br>
conductor or the earth.<br>
13.	Circuit breaker failure protection: Whenever the circuit breaker at<br>
protected terminal fails to trip, this protection would then send a<br>
command to upstream circuit breaker to backtrip.<br>
Non-Protection Features<br>
1. Autorecloser with checksynchronism: This provides upto 4 reclose shots,<br>
with checksynchronism for voltage, frequency and phase, and can be set<br>
for any combination of line and bus conditions.<br>
 <br>
2.	Distance to fault locator.<br>
3.	Measurements of field data and computation of derived parameters are<br>
available for display at the relay as well as accessed from the serial<br>
communication facility.<br>
4.	Event / Fault / Disturbance / Oscillography Records.<br>
5.	IEC61850 communication protocol.<br>
The program continuously monitors the field data in order to determine the<br>
status of the associated transmission line, in real time. This provides information<br>
related to the line conditions and whether any alarms or trips are to be issued<br>
by the relay.<br>
Fig. 5 shows the relay connected to the transmission line for monitoring the<br>
current and voltages in real-time, along with the photograph of the relay. The<br>
field inputs viz. three phase currents, the three phase voltages and the busbar<br>
voltage are connected to the relay terminal blocks. The relay contacts are used<br>
to operate the circuit breaker (52).<br>
Fig.6 shows a block diagram of the hardware of the system. The relay hardware<br>
comprises of seven modules. The auxiliary D.C. voltage given to the relay is first<br>
stepped down to 24Vdc in module 6. 1. This voltage energizes module 6. 2,<br>
 <br>
module 6.5 and module 6.7. The +15Vdc and -15Vdc is used to energize module<br>
6.3 and module 6.4.<br>
The field inputs viz. three phase currents and the three phase voltages<br>
(described in Fig.l), connected to the relay terminal blocks, is first processed by<br>
module 6.3. The stepped down signals are then filtered by module 6.4 for any<br>
high frequency disturbances and to avoid aliasing errors. These signals are then<br>
sent to section B of module 6.2.<br>
The processing module 6.2 has the relay algorithm residing in section C. When<br>
the relay is powered ON, the program control, after necessary hardware,<br>
software and memory initializations, first digitizes the analog data in section B,<br>
and processes the data, checking for any fault. When a fault occurs, the relay<br>
senses it and issues a command in the form an annunciation or a trip, depending<br>
upon the severity of the fault. The final relay outputs are sent through section D<br>
to the module 6.5. This module has sixteen numbers of contacts with higher<br>
driving capability and these potential free contacts are brought out to relay<br>
terminal blocks (described in Fig. 1). Relay status is indicated by means of lamps<br>
provided on the front side of the panel. In addition, alarms and trip contacts are<br>
brought out in the form of potential-free contacts, which can, in turn, be used for<br>
either operating the circuit breaker or to drive audio / visual alarms. The<br>
 <br>
contacts and lamps are of self resetting type.The relay functions are stored in<br>
the compact flash disk memory shown in section C. This section comprises of the<br>
realtime module (201), non-realtime module (203) and the IEC61850<br>
communication module (204) along with the inter process communication<br>
channels (202 and 205) described in Fig. 2.<br>
Module 6.2 also has two serial ports RS232- section F, through which the<br>
metered data is communicated to the operator interface on the front of the relay<br>
(module 6.7) and also to the PC-based HMI (Human machine interface) program<br>
(module 6.6). It can also read the set parameters from the operator interface.<br>
The section E is the 100 Mbps Ethernet port that is available on the relay for<br>
communication over Ethernet using the IEC61850 communication protocol. The<br>
section G comprises of two RS485 ports which facilitate the multi drop<br>
communication features of the relay.<br>
Method of integrating IEC 61850 communication protocol:<br>
Fig.l describes the method of implementation of the software modules in the<br>
prior art system. The model consists of a realtime module 102, which accesses<br>
the wired field data - from the current and voltage transformers in the form of<br>
analog inputs, status signals from various field devices in the form of digital data<br>
 <br>
through the module 101, and processes the same to ascertain the abnormal<br>
state of the transmission line using the various protection algorithms built in the<br>
module. The digital data to control the field devices viz. the circuit breaker is<br>
provided by the module 102 in the form of digital outputs from the module 103,<br>
which is wired to the respective devices. The processed data from the module<br>
102 is transferred to non realtime module 105 through inter-process<br>
communication channel 104. This information is then passed by the module 105<br>
to the serial ports 106 for communication to the front end terminal 107, and the<br>
storage of the oscillography data file 108, consisting of realtime data during<br>
fault. Such a system described in Fig.l meets the requirements of a<br>
multifunction numerical line protection relay. However, this relay cannot ensure<br>
interoperability between devices in the substation to exchange information.<br>
Fig. 2 shows the augmentation of an additional module with IEC 61850<br>
communication interface 204. The realtime module 201, non-realtime module<br>
203 along with the interprocess communication 202 is the same as those<br>
described in Fig.l with the same functions. The module 205 is the IEC 61850<br>
communication interface with the Server, GOOSE and SNTP client processes. The<br>
bidirectional information exchange between the module 201 and 204 is by means<br>
of the interprocess communication 205 realised using First-In-First-Outs (FIFOs).<br>
The addition of module 204 makes the relay IEC 61850 compliant and associates<br>
 <br>
the relay (now configured as server) to any of the clients and also processes the<br>
information to be transmitted over the Ethernet in the local area network 206<br>
viz. the station bus. This module can also receive information from clients.<br>
GOOSE subscription and publish mechanisms are also handled. SNTP client<br>
process continuously polls for the time over the LAN and resets the hardware<br>
clock accordingly.<br>
Fig.3 describes in detail the various interprocess communication mechanisms<br>
between the various modules for data exchange. They are realised using FIFOs.<br>
The realtime module 201 interacts with the module 203, both of which comprise<br>
the relay application function. The SendFIFO 307 transmits the metering and<br>
monitoring data processed by the module 201. The SendEventFIFO 308<br>
transmits the realtime events processed by the module 201. The SamplesFIFO<br>
309 transmits measurands measured by the module 201. The ReceiveFIFO 306<br>
transmits the settings information from the module 203 which has been accessed<br>
over the serial network. The Server module 303, GOOSE module 304 and SNTP<br>
Client module 305 facilitates the IEC 61850 communication protocol in the relay.<br>
The ApplicationtoServerFIFO 310, ApplicationtoGOOSEFIFO 312 cater to the<br>
information transmission from the relay application function to the IEC 61850<br>
module. The ServertoApplicationFIFO 311 and GOOSEtoApplicationFIFO 313 are<br>
designed for information reception by the relay function application. The<br>
 <br>
ServertoGOOSEFIFO 314 and GOOSEtoServeFIFO 315 serve to facilitate data<br>
exchange between the modules 303 and 304. The SNTP Client module directly<br>
accesses the SNTP clock over the LAN and resets the hardware clock in the relay.<br>
Figure 4 describes in detail the model! implementation in the relay. The<br>
organization of the various Logical Nodes (LN) and the IEC61850 Services is<br>
enumerated below. The relay is configured in a Single Logical Device (LD) model<br>
viz. PROTEC1, with the various LNs catering to the System, Measurements,<br>
Protection, Control and Records functions. The LD is the virtual device that exists<br>
to enable aggregation of related logical nodes and data sets. As the relay is a<br>
multifunctional protection IED with a complex functional hierarchy, it is modeled<br>
according to the definitions of the IEC 61850 model. LLNO is the common logical<br>
node; LPHDlis the physical device node; GGIOl, GGI02, GGI03 are the generic<br>
inputs and outputs; grouped under the System function. Measurement function<br>
is performed by the MMXU1 logical node.<br>
The server has to two groups of functions - protection and non-protection. The<br>
protection functions can be further divided into main protection - distance<br>
protection, overcurrent protection with instantaneous / definite / inverse time<br>
delayed overcurrent, instantaneous / definite / inverse time delayed earthfault,<br>
definite / inverse time delayed overvoltage protection, definite / inverse time<br>
 <br>
delayed undervoltage protection; backup protection function; control and<br>
protection related functions. The local backup protection is breaker-failure. The<br>
control functions are 4-shot autorelcoser with check synchronism, power swing<br>
blocking and circuit breaker control. Non-protection features are measurements,<br>
records etc. PDIS1, PDS2, PDSI3, PDIS4, PDIS5, PDIS6, PDIS7, PDIS8, PDIS9,<br>
PDIS10 are the various instances of the Distance protection function modeled in<br>
the relay. These represent the different zones for the phase-to-ground and<br>
phase-to-phase protection. PTOC1 is the inverse time three-phase overcurrent<br>
protection function, PTOC2 is the earth-fault protection, PTOC3 is the broken<br>
conductor function and PTOC4 is the negative sequence overcurrent protection.<br>
Instantaneous overcurrent functions are modeled using the PIOC1 for the three<br>
phase currents and PIOC2 for the earth-fault current. Voltage functions for the<br>
protection of three phase voltages are catered to by the PTOV1 for the<br>
overvoltage and PTUV1 for the undervoltage protections. The trip conditioning<br>
module - PTRC1 is modeled for the logical conditioning of the pickup, operate<br>
and trip states of the various protection functions LNs. RBRF1 is the circuit<br>
breaker fail protection function. The Records section comprises of the RDRE1 -<br>
Disturbance Recorder and the RFLOl - Fault Locater. Control section comprises<br>
of a four shot Autorecloser represented by RREC1, check synchronism by RSYN1,<br>
power swing blocking by RPSB1 and circuit breaker switch by XCBR1.<br>
 <br>
The field signals from the current transformers 401 and voltage transformers 402<br>
are wired to the data acquisition section in the relay 404 and the processed<br>
parameters are mapped to the MMXU1 LN data objects. The digital inputs from<br>
the field are mapped GGIOl, GGI02 and GGI03 LN data objects. The circuit<br>
breaker switch 403 can be controlled by the GOOSE data set.<br>
IEC 61850 is built-in as a communication feature of the device. The other<br>
services programmed in the relay are the Data sets (DS), Substitution, Setting<br>
Group Control Block (SGCB), Buffered Reporting (BR), Unbuffered Reporting<br>
(UBR), Logs, File transfer and Time Synchronization. These features allow the<br>
information exchange between the relay and other IEC 61850 compliant IEDs<br>
over the Ethernet port 405.<br>
A DS is an ordered group of object references of data or data attributes. The<br>
data and data attributes are organized into DS for the convenience of the client.<br>
The DS class contains attributes for name, path name and list of dataset<br>
members which contains functionally constrained data or data attributes of the<br>
data and data attributes which are organized in the DS. As both the client and<br>
server keep track of the order of membership of a DS, only the name of the DS<br>
and the current values are transmitted.<br>
 <br>
The substitution model allows for value of a data attribute to be substituted with<br>
a manually entered value if the attribute has a particular functional constraint,<br>
namely MX for analogue values or ST for status values. This allows a client<br>
operator to enter a substitution value for a particular data attribute, so that if it is<br>
retrieved, for instance by a report, the substitution value will be transmitted<br>
instead of the value determined by the process.<br>
This SGCB class model allows for a data instance to have several values, which<br>
are used at a time, and can also be applied on a set of data instances. The relay<br>
has 4 setting groups (SG) and at a time one of them is the active and the data<br>
instances have values corresponding to that SG. Any of the other three SG is set<br>
to editable SG.<br>
Reporting is handled by the REPORT-CONTROL-BLOCK class which controls the<br>
procedures that are required for reporting values of data from one or more<br>
logical nodes to one client. Three trigger options are defined - data change,<br>
quality change, and data update - which can cause a report to be sent to a<br>
client. Buffered Report Control Block (BRCB) allows for sending of reports to be<br>
issued immediately, or for the event to be buffered for transmission after an<br>
amount to time specified. BRCB provides the sequence of events functionality<br>
and if the connector is broken when reporting is to take place, the report is<br>
 <br>
buffered and sent when the connection is re-established. In Unbuffered Report<br>
Control Block (URCB), there is no buffering, and if the connection is broken, the<br>
reports are discarded.<br>
The relay restricts the access to an instance of a report control block to one<br>
client at a time till the association is aborted or released. Multiple instances (5) of<br>
the report control block classes are made available so that more than one client<br>
can receive reports of the same values of the data. The maximum number of<br>
clients that may be associated with the relay at a time is configured to be 8.<br>
Logging is provided by maintaining an internal storage of historical data values<br>
for subsequent reviewing or producing statistics. It is independent of<br>
communication and should take place even rf communication breaks down.<br>
Periodic recordings and event-triggered sequence of events data are logged.<br>
LOG-CONTROL-BLOCK (LCB) class controls the logging and the log class handles<br>
logging. One log can be controlled by multiple LCBs. The LCB class controls the<br>
procedures that are required for storing values of data attribute into a log. Each<br>
enabled LOG can associate a DS with a log. Changes in a value of a member in<br>
the particular DS will be stored as a log entry filed as FIFO. When the stored<br>
data reaches the maximal size of the log, the oldest entries are overwritten. LCB<br>
contains attributes for name, path-name, whether the instance is enabled, DS<br>
being<br>
 <br>
monitored, optional fields, trigger options and integrity period. Two LCBs are<br>
defined the relay IED.<br>
GOOSE class model is provided for fast and reliable system-wide distribution of<br>
input and output data values. It can also provide an efficient method for<br>
delivering the same GOOSE information to physical devices through multicast /<br>
broadcast services. Time and Time synchronization model is modeled as SNTP<br>
client which can frequently poll for the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)<br>
broadcast from a SNTP Server, and set the real time clock of the hardware<br>
module and synchronise the time in the relay with that of the other IEDs. File<br>
Transfer Services is modeled to send files requested by clients.<br>
