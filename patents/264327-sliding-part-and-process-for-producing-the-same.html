DESCRIPTION<br>
SLIDING PART AND PROCESS FOR PRODUCING THE SAME<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to a sliding part<br>
such as a bearing or the like and a method of manufacturing<br>
the same.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002] As a sliding part having reduced frictional<br>
resistance and improved durability and generating no noise,<br>
a sliding part is known that is a flat powder formed by<br>
sintering a powder compact, which is fabricated by filling<br>
an iron-based raw powder and a copper-based raw powder in a<br>
filling portion of a forming mold and applying vibration to<br>
the mold at the same time for compacting, and having an<br>
aspect ratio of the copper-based raw powder larger than that<br>
of the iron-based raw powder, on a surface of which copper<br>
segregates (for example, refer to Japanese Unexamined Patent<br>
Application, First Publication No.2003-221606); or a sliding<br>
part that is a flat powder formed by sintering a powder<br>
compact, which is fabricated by filling the iron-based raw<br>
powder and the copper-based raw powder into the filling<br><br>
- 2 -<br>
portion of the forming mold and applying vibration to the<br>
mold at the same time for compacting, and having an average<br>
value of a maximum projected area of the copper-based raw<br>
powder larger than that of the iron-based raw powder, in<br>
which the copper-base raw powder contains flat powder of<br>
copper or copper-alloy and on a surface of which copper<br>
segregates (for example, refer to Japanese Unexamined Patent<br>
Application, First Publication No.2004-84038).<br>
DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION<br>
[0003] However, in the above related art, the mixture of<br>
the iron-based raw powder and the copper-based flat raw<br>
powder composed of flat powder having a larger aspect ratio<br>
than the iron-based raw powder is filled into the filling<br>
portion of the forming mold, and at the same time vibration<br>
is applied to the forming mold, such that the copper-based<br>
flat raw powder segregates at the outer side within the<br>
filling portion, overlaps each other in the thickness<br>
direction, and at the same time segregates at a gathering<br>
surface in a state in which the direction intersecting the<br>
thickness direction is aligned with the longitudinal<br>
direction of the surface. However, the iron-based raw<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
powder emerges at a part of the surface, as well as the<br>
segregated copper-based flat raw powder, and a gap is formed<br>
between the copper-based flat raw powders which emerges at<br>
the surface and are adjacent to each other. As a result,<br>
the gap between the copper-based raw powder and the iron-<br>
based raw powder, or the gap between the copper-based flat<br>
raw powders is formed in the surface. Due to these gaps,<br>
the surface coverage ratio of the copper in the sliding part<br>
cannot be increased.<br>
[0004] Accordingly, it is an advantage of the present<br>
invention to increase the surface coverage ratio of the<br>
copper in the sliding part formed by filling the iron-based<br>
raw powder and the copper-based raw powder having an aspect<br>
ratio larger than that of the iron-based raw powder into the<br>
filling portion of the forming mold, compacting the raw<br>
powders to form a powder compact, and sintering the powder<br>
compact, in which the copper segregates at the surface of<br>
the sliding part.<br>
MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEM<br>
[0005] According to a first aspect of the invention, a<br>
sliding part is formed by filling an iron-based raw powder<br>
and a copper-based raw powder into a filling portion of a<br>

compact, and sintering the powder compact. The copper-based<br><br>
- 4 -<br>
raw powder is composed of a copper-based flat raw powder<br>
having an average diameter smaller than that of the iron-<br>
based raw powder and an aspect ratio larger than that of the<br>

raw powder consists of a copper-based flat raw powder having<br>
an average value of a maximum projected area smaller than<br><br>
- 5 -<br>
that of the maximum projected area of the iron-based raw<br>
powder and an aspect ratio larger than that of the iron-<br>
based raw powder; and a copper-based small-sized raw powder<br>
having the average value of the maximum projected area<br>
smaller than that of the maximum projected area of the<br>
copper-based flat raw powder; and in which copper is allowed<br>
to segregate on a surface of the sliding part.<br>
[0010] According to a sixth aspect of the invention, in<br>
the sliding part according to the fifth asepct, a surface<br>
coverage ratio of copper in the sliding part is 80% or more.<br>
[0011] According to a seventh aspect of the invention, a<br>
method of manufacturing a sliding part, includes steps of<br>
filling an iron-based raw powder and a copper-based raw<br>
powder into a filling portion of a forming mold, compacting<br>
the raw powders to form a powder compact, and sintering the<br>
powder compact, in which the copper-based raw powder<br>
consists of a copper-based flat raw powder having the<br>
average diameter smaller than that of the iron-based raw<br>
powder and an aspect ratio larger than that of the iron-<br>
based raw powder; and a copper-based small-sized raw powder<br>
having an average diameter smaller than that of the copper-<br>
based flat raw powder; and the copper-based flat raw powder<br>
in the filling portion is allowed to segregate on a surface<br>
of the powder compact.<br>
[0012] According to an eighth aspect of the present<br><br>
- 6 -<br>
invention, a method of manufacturing a sliding part,<br>
includes steps of filling an iron-based raw powder and a<br>
copper-based raw powder into a filling portion of a forming<br>
mold, compacting the raw powders to form a powder compact,<br>
and sintering the powder compact, in which the copper-based<br>
raw powder is composed of a copper-based flat raw powder<br>
having an average value of the maximum projected area<br>
smaller than that of the maximum projected area of the iron-<br>
based raw powder and an aspect ratio larger than that of the<br>
iron-based raw powder; and a copper-based small-sized raw<br>
powder having an average value of the maximum projected area<br>

the method of manufacturing the sliding part according to<br>
the seventh or eighth aspect, the aspect ratio of the<br>
copper-based flat raw powder is 10 or more.<br>
[0014] According to a tenth aspect of the invention, in<br>
the method of manufacturing the sliding part according to<br>
any one of the seventh to ninth aspects, a ratio of the<br>
copper-based raw powder is 20 to 40% by weight with respect<br>
to all raw powders.<br><br>
- 7 -<br>
EFFECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0015] According to the first and fifth aspects of the<br>
present invention, when a bearing is composed of the sliding<br>
part, the copper-based small-sized raw powder as well as the<br>
copper-based flat raw powder emerges at the surface, such<br>
that a rotator slides on the surface covered with the copper,<br>
and the coefficient of the friction between the rotation<br>
axis and the surface side decreases, thus a rotation is<br>
performed smoothly. At the same time, predetermined<br>
strength and durability can be obtained due to the iron.<br>
Furthermore, in the above structure, even though the surface<br>
on which the rotator rotates is abraded, since the<br>
predetermined ratio of copper is contained below the surface,<br>
the durability of the sliding portion becomes excellent.<br>
[0016] According to the second and sixth aspects of the<br>
present invention, the coefficient of the friction of the<br>
sliding portion can be suppressed at a significantly lower<br>
level.<br>
[0017] According to the third and ninth aspects of the<br>
present invention, since the aspect ratio is set to 10 or<br>
more, when vibration is applied, the flat powder segregates<br>
easily at the surface, and thus it is possible to obtain the<br>
sliding part having a high copper concentration at the<br>
surface.<br>
[0018] According to the fourth aspect of the present<br><br>
- 8 -<br>
invention, when the ratio of the copper-based flat raw<br>
powder is less than 20% by weight, the ratio of copper at<br>
the surface decreases and the frictional resistance<br>
increases. In addition, when the ratio of copper-based flat<br>
raw powder exceeds 40% by weight, the ratio of the copper-<br>
based raw powder in all of the raw powders becomes too large,<br>
and it is not favorable in terms of the strength. Therefore,<br>
if the ratio is set in the range of 20 to 40%, the<br>
frictional resistance decreases and it is possible to obtain<br>
a sliding part having a high strength.<br>
[0019] According to the seventh and eighth aspects of the<br>
present invention, it is possible to obtain a sliding part<br>
having a low coefficient of friction and an improved<br>
durability.<br>
[0020] According to the tenth aspect of the present<br>
invention, when the ratio of the copper-based flat raw<br>
powder is less than 20% by weight, the ratio of copper at<br>
the surface decreases and the frictional resistance<br>
increases. In addition, when the ratio of the copper-based<br>
flat raw powder exceeds 40% by weight, the ratio thereof<br>
becomes too large and it is not favorable in terms of the<br>
strength. Therefore, if the ratio is set in the range of<br>
20% to 40% by weight, the frictional resistance decreases<br>
and it is possible to obtain a sliding part having a high<br>
strength.<br><br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
[0023] Hereinafter, a preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention will be described with reference to the attached<br>
drawings. However, the embodiment to be described below is<br>
not intended to limit the invention described in claims.<br>
Furthermore, the entire constitutions to be described later<br>
are not essential to the invention.<br>
Embodiment 1<br>
[0024] A method of manufacturing the invention will now be<br>
described. An iron-based raw powder 1, a copper-based flat<br>
raw powder 2, and a copper-based small-sized raw powder 3<br>
are mixed at a predetermined ratio (SI). As shown in Fig. 2,<br>
as the iron-based raw powder 1, an irregular-shaped powder<br><br>
- 11 -<br>
having a substantially spherical shape such as an atomized<br>
powder is used. An average diameter of the iron-based raw<br>
powder 1 is in the range of 50 to 100 μm, but is preferably<br>
in the range of 60 to 80 μm. Furthermore, as shown in Fig.<br>
3, a flat powder is used as the copper-based raw material 2.<br>
An aspect ratio (diameter D/thickness T) of the flat powder<br>
is 10% or more, but is preferably in the range of 20 to 50%.<br>
The average diameter D of the copper-based flat raw powder 2<br>
is 80μm, and the average thickness T is in the range of 1 to<br>
5 μm Furthermore, as the copper-based flat raw powder 2,<br>
it is possible to use a mixture consisting of a copper<br>
powder as the main component and a tin powder in the range<br>
of 2 to 30% by weight. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 4, an<br>
irregular-shaped powder having a substantially spherical<br>
shape is used as the copper-based small-sized raw powder 3.<br>
The average diameter of the copper-based small-sized raw<br>
powder 3 is in the range of 30 to 50 μm but is preferably<br>
20 μm.<br>
[0025] Herewith, the average diameter of the copper-based<br>
flat raw powder 2 becomes smaller than that of the iron-<br>
based raw powder 1, and becomes larger than that of the<br>
copper-based small-sized raw powder 3. Due to the above<br>
comparative difference in size, the average value of the<br>
maximum projected area A of the copper-based flat raw powder<br>
2 becomes smaller than that of the maximum value of the<br><br>
- 12 -<br>
projected area B of the iron-based raw powder 1, and the<br>
average value of the maximum projected area A becomes larger<br>
than that of the maximum projected area C of the copper-<br>
based small-sized raw powder 3.<br>
[0026] As shown in Fig. 5, a bearing 5 has a substantially<br>
cylindrical shape and a substantially cylindrical-shaped<br>
sliding surface 51, on which a rotational shaft, which is a<br>
rotator (not shown), rotationally slides, is formed at the<br>
center of the bearing 5. At both sides in the longitudinal<br>
direction of the sliding surface 51, which is a sliding<br>
portion, flat end surfaces 52 and 53 are formed, and an<br>
outer circumferential surface 54 thereof is formed like a<br>
cylindrical shape.<br>
[0027] The mixture (mixed at SI) of the iron-based raw<br>
powder 1, the copper-based flat raw powder 2, and the<br>
copper-based small-sized raw powder 3 is filled into a<br>
filling portion 16 of a forming mold 11. In the mixed<br>
powder filled into the filling portion 16, a ratio of the<br>
copper-based flat raw powder is 20 to 40% by weight with<br>
respect to all raw powders.<br>
[0028] Fig. 6 is an example of the forming mold 11. The<br>
forming mold 11 includes a die 12, a core rod 13, a lower-<br>
side punch 14, and an upper-side punch 15. A vertical<br>
direction of the forming mold 11 is an axial direction (a<br>
vertical axial direction of the press). The die 12 has a<br><br>
- 13 -<br>
substantially cylindrical shape, and the core rod 13 having<br>
a substantially cylindrical shape is coaxially positioned in<br>
the die 12. The lower-side punch 14 has a substantially<br>
cylindrical shape and is fitted between the die 12 and the<br>
core rod 13 from the lower side, so that the lower-side<br>
punch 14 can move in the vertical direction. The upper<br>
punch 15 has a substantially cylindrical shape and is fitted<br>
between the die 12 and the core rod 13 from the upper side,<br>
so that the upper-side punch 15 can move in the vertical<br>
direction and in such a manner as to be freely detachable.<br>
Furthermore, the filling portion 16 is formed among the die<br>
12, the core rod 13, and the lower-side punch 14. An inner<br>
circumferential surface of the die 12 forms the outer<br>
circumferential surface 54. An upper surface of the lower-<br>
side punch 14 forms the end surface 53. A lower surface of<br>
the upper-side punch 15 forms the end surface 52. The outer<br>
circumferential surface of the core rod 13 forms the sliding<br>
surface 51.<br>
[0029] As shown in Fig. 6, the mixture of the iron-based<br>
raw powder 1, the copper-based flat raw powder 2, and the<br>
copper-based small-sized raw powder 3 is filled into the<br>
filling portion 16, and a vibration is applied to the<br>
mixture of the raw materials 1 to 3 (S2). In this case, the<br>
upper side of the filling portion 16 is closed by the upper-<br>
side punch 15, and vibration is applied to the filling<br><br>
- 14 -<br>
portion 16 at the accelerating speed of 0.01 to 3G without<br>
pressing the punches 14 and 15. When the vibration is<br>
applied to the filling portion 16, the copper-based flat raw<br>
powder 2, which is flat powder, segregates at the outer side<br>
within the filling portion 16, that is, at the sliding<br>
surface 51 or the outer circumferential surface 54, overlaps<br>
each other in the thickness direction, and gathers so as to<br>
make the direction intersecting the thickness direction<br>
aligned with the longitudinal direction of the surface. In<br>
addition, the iron-based raw powder 1 sometimes emerges<br>
between the copper-based flat raw powders 2 as well as the<br>
segregated copper-based flat raw powder 2 in the outer side<br>
within the filling portion 16. However, the copper-based<br>
small-sized raw powder 3A intrudes into the gap formed<br>
between the iron-based raw powder 1 and the copper-based<br>
flat raw powder 2 and then emerges at the outer side, or the<br>
copper-based small-sized raw powder 3B intrudes into the gap<br>
formed between the copper-based flat raw powders 2 and then<br>
emerges at the outer side. As a result, the surface<br>
coverage ratio of copper in the sliding surface 51 becomes<br>
80% or more, or 85% or more. The surface coverage ratio of<br>
copper means the surface coverage ratio not including the<br>
hole region, like the surface coverage ratio of copper in<br>
the latter related art.<br>
[0030] Furthermore, since the flat surface of the copper-<br><br>
- 15 -<br>
based raw powder 2 is wide, it is possible to segregate the<br>
copper-based raw powder 2 at the outer side within the<br>
filling portion 16 by generating static electricity on the<br>
surface of the forming mold 11 surrounding the filling<br>
portion 16, or it is possible to segregate the copper-based<br>
raw powder 2 at the outer side within the filling portion 16<br>
by using magnetic force as well as the vibration.<br>
[0031] On the other hand, the remaining copper-based flat<br>
raw powder 2A at the inner side that has not segregated at<br>
the outer side within the filling portion 16, that is, the<br>
sliding surface 51 and the outer circumferential surface 54<br>
are disposed to surround the iron-based raw powder 1 with<br>
the plurality of copper-based small-sized raw powders 3.<br>
[0032] Then, the upper-side and lower-side punches 15 and<br>
14 press the mixture of the raw powders 1 to 3 within the<br>
filling portion 16 to form a powder compact 6 (S3). As<br>
shown in Fig. 8, the copper-based flat raw powder 2, which<br>
is a flat powder, emerges at the surface, and the ratio of<br>
the iron-based raw powder 1 increases as it goes toward the<br>
inner side of the powder compact 6. The powder compact 6 is<br>
sintered (S4) to form a sintered bearing 5. A post process<br>
such as a sizing process or an oil impregnation process is<br>
performed on the bearing 5, if needed.<br>
[0033] In the above embodiment, in accordance with the<br>
first aspect, in the bearing 5 which is a sliding part<br><br>
- 16 -<br>
formed by filling the raw powder into the filling portion 16<br>
of the forming mold 11, compacting the raw powder to form a<br>
powder compact 6, and sintering the powder compact 6, the<br>
copper-based raw powder is composed of the copper-based flat<br>
raw powder 2 having an average diameter smaller than that of<br>
the iron-based raw powder 1 and an aspect ratio larger than<br>
that of the iron-based raw powder 1; and the copper-based<br>
small-sized raw powder 3 having an average diameter smaller<br>
than that of the copper-based flat raw powder 2, and the<br>
copper is allowed to segregate at the surface of the sliding<br>
part. Therefore, the copper-based raw powder 2, which is a<br>
flat powder, and the iron-based raw powder 1 are filled into<br>
the filling portion 16, and the vibration is applied thereto,<br>
such that the copper-based flat powder segregates at the<br>
surface. Furthermore, in the obtained bearing 5, the<br>
surface is covered with the copper-based small-sized raw<br>
powder 3 emerged on the surface as well as the copper-based<br>
flat raw powder 2, thereby it is possible to increase the<br>
surface coverage ratio of copper.<br>
[0034] Therefore, the rotator slides on the sliding<br>
surface 51 which is covered with the copper, and the<br>
coefficient of friction between the rotation axis and the<br>
sliding surface 51 becomes small, thereby the rotation<br>
performs smoothly. In addition, the predetermined strength<br>
and the durability can be obtained due to the iron.<br><br>
- 17 -<br>
Furthermore, in the above structure, even though the sliding<br>
surface 51, on which the rotator rotates, is abraded, since<br>
a predetermined ratio of copper is contained below the<br>
sliding surface 51, the durability of the sliding portion<br>
becomes excellent.<br>
[0035] Furthermore, in the above embodiment, in accordance<br>
with the second and sixth aspects, since the surface<br>
coverage ratio of copper in the sliding surface 51, which is<br>
the sliding portion, is 80% or more, it is possible to<br>
suppress the coefficient of the friction at a significantly<br>
lower level.<br>
[0036] Furthermore, in the above embodiment, in accordance<br>
with the third and ninth aspects, since the aspect ratio of<br>
the copper-based flat raw powder 2 is set to 10 or more,<br>
when a vibration is applied, the copper-based flat powder 2<br>
segregates easily at the surface, and it is possible to<br>
obtain the bearing 5 having a high copper concentration at<br>
the surface.<br>
[0037] Furthermore, in the above embodiment, in accordance<br>
with the fourth aspect, since the ratio of the copper-based<br>
flat raw powder 2 is set in the range of 20% to 40%, it is<br>
possible to obtain a bearing 5 having low frictional<br>
resistance and high strength.<br>
[0038] Furthermore, in the above embodiment, in accordance<br>
with the fifth aspect, in the bearing 5 formed by filling<br><br>
- 18 -<br>
the raw powder into the filling portion 16 of the forming<br>
mold 11, compacting the raw powder to form the powder<br>
compact 6, and sintering the powder compact 6, the copper-<br>
based raw powder is composed of the copper-based flat raw<br>
powder 2 having an average value of the maximum projected<br>
area A smaller than the average value of the maximum<br>
projected area B of the iron-based raw powder 1 and an<br>
aspect ratio larger than that of the iron-based raw powder<br>
1; and the copper-based small-sized raw powder 3 having the<br>
average value of the maximum projected area C smaller than<br>
that of the maximum projected area A of the copper-based<br>
flat raw powder 2, and the copper is allowed to segregate at<br>
the surface of the sliding part. Therefore, the copper-<br>
based raw powder 2, which is a flat powder, and the iron-<br>
based raw powder 1 are filled into the filling portion 16,<br>
and the vibration is applied thereto, such that the copper-<br>
based flat powder segregates at the surface. Furthermore,<br>
in the obtained bearing 5, the surface is covered with the<br>
copper-based small-sized raw powder 3 that has emerged on<br>
the surface as well as the copper-based flat raw powder 2,<br>
thereby it is possible to increase the surface coverage<br>
ratio of copper.<br>
[0039] Furthermore, in the above embodiment, in accordance<br>
with the seventh and eighth aspects, the surface is covered<br>
with the copper-based small-sized raw powder 3 that has<br><br>
- 19 -<br>
emerged at the surface as well as the copper-based flat raw<br>
powder 2 appear, it is possible to obtain the bearing 5, the<br>
surface coverage ratio of copper of which increases.<br>
[0040] Furthermore, in the above embodiment, in accordance<br>
with the tenth aspect, since the ratio of the copper-based<br>
raw powder is set in the range of 20% to 40% by weight with<br>
respect to all of the raw powders, the frictional resistance<br>
decreases and it is possible to obtain the sliding part<br>
having a high strength.<br>
[0041] Furthermore, the present invention is not limited<br>
to the above embodiment, and various modifications can be<br>
made. For example, the flat powder can include a rod-shaped<br>
powder. In this case, the ratio of the length and the<br>
diameter becomes the aspect ratio.<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>

manufacturing the same according to the asepcts of the<br>
invention can be applied to various sliding parts in<br>
