PCT/EP99/06405<br><br>
Plug shell 1 (Figures 2-4) has a front face 3 and a rear face 4, grids 5. and a plurality of cavities 6 for separate contacts (non shown). Each cavity 6 is surrounded on the rear face 4 by an external shoulder 7 and comprises internal longitudinal ridges 8 ending on the front face 3 in an external groove 9 formed around cavity 6.<br>
Socket shell 2 (Figures 5-7) has a front face 10 and a rear face! 1, grids 12, and a plurality of cavities 13 for separate contacts (not shown), respectively opposed to the cavities 6 of the plug shell 1. Each cavity 13 has an inner shoulder 14 and comprises external ridges 15 formed therearound on the rear face 11 of socket shell 2.<br>
Those structures of the DIN 41612 connector are standard and need no further description.<br>
* A front plug shell hollow insert 16 (Figures 1 and 17, 18) and a rear plug shell<br>
hollow insert 17 (Figures 1 and 19, 20) are assembled in communication to one<br>
another in one of the cavities 6 of the plug shell 1.<br>
Front plug shell insert 16 comprises a first portion 18 with an outer-thread 19 and second portion 20 in sliding fit in cavity 6. Second portion 20 has a larger diameter than first portion 18, and first portion 18 ends in a reduced hole 22. Second portion 20 ends in a collar 21 adapted to rest against the external groove 9 of cavity 6. Preferably, second portion 20 has longitudinally extending external grooves 23 for engagement on the internal ridges 8 of cavity 6.<br>
Rear plug shell insert 17 comprises a first portion 24 with an inner thread 25 adapted to mesh on the outer thread 19 of the first portion 18 of front plug shell insert 16. and a second portion 26 rotatively mounted in cavity 6 and ending in a<br>

collar 27 adapted to rest against the external shoulder 7 of cavity 6. Preferably, the rear plug shell insert 17 has a circular transverse inner latch catching groove 28 and a longitudinal inner groove 29 the purpose of which will be explained hereafter. Collar 27 has transverse screwdriver slots 30.<br>
Thus assembly of front plug shell insert 16 and rear plug sheli insert 17 is achieved by engaging front plug shell insert 16 into cavity 6 as from the front face 3 of plug shell 1 and by engaging rear plug shell insert 17 into cavity 6 as from the rear face 4 of plug shell 1. Meshing of the thread 25 of rear plug shell insert 17 onto thread 19 of front plug shell insert 16 via a screwdriver inserted in slots 30 allows assembly of the two plug shell inserts. Angular position of the assembly is selected and fixed by interpenetration of the internal ridges 8 of cavity 6 into longitudinally extending external grooves 23 of front plug shell insert 16. Longitudinal position of the assembly is fixed by the collar 21 of front plug shell insert 16 resting in groove 9 formed around cavity 6 and by the collar 27 of rear plug shell 17 resting against external shoulder 7 formed around cavity 6.<br>
A front socket shell hollow insert 31 (Figures 1 and 15, 16) and a rear socket shell hollow insert 32 (Figures 1 and 13. 14) are assembled in communication to one another in a cavity 13 of socket shell 2 which is opposed to the cavity 6 in which front plug shell insert 16 and rear plug shell insert 17 are assembled.<br>

Rear socket shell insert 32 comprises a first portion 37 in sliding fit in cavity 13 and with an outer thread 38 meshing into the inner thread 34 of the first portion 33 of the front socket shell insert 31. Rear socket shell insert 32 has a second portion 39 forming a square collar 40 resting between external ridges 15 formed around cavity 13 on the rear face 11 of socket shell 2. Preferably, the rear socket shell insert 32 comprises a circular transverse inner latch catching groove 41 and a longitudinal inner groove 42 the purpose of which will be described hereafter.<br>
Thus the assembly of front socket shell insert 31 and rear socket shell insert 32 is obtained by engaging^front socket shell insert 31 into cavity 13 as from the front face 10 of socket shell 2 and by engaging rear socket shell insert 32 into cavity 13 as from the rear face 11 of socket shell 2. Meshing of the thread 34 of front socket shell insert 31 onto thread 38 of rear socket shell insert 32 via a screwdriver inserted in slots 36 allows assembly of the two socket shell inserts. Angular position of the assembly is selected and fixed by interpenetration of the square collar 40 of rear socket shell insert 32 into the ridges 15 of socket shell 2. Longitudinal position of the assembly is fixed by the square collar 40 of rear socket shell insert 32 resting against rear face 11 of socket shell 2 and by the first portion 33 of the front socket shell insert 31 resting against inner shoulder 14 of cavity 13.<br>
A tubular sleeve retainer 43 (Figures 1 and 8, 9) has a first portion 44 inserted and affixed in the first portion 18 of front plug shell insert 16 and a second portion 45 engaged into the second portion 35 of the front socket shell insert 31. Preferably the first portion 44 of tubular sleeve retainer 43 has a straight knurl 46 and is press fitted into the first portion 18 of front plug shell insert 16. The second portion 45 of sleeve retainer 43 ends in a reduced hole 47.<br>
An alignment sleeve 48 (Figures 1 and 10, 11). preferably of ceramic material, is placed in floating condition in the housing 49 formed in sleeve retainer 43,<br>

PCT/F.P99/06405<br><br>
between reduced hole 47 and the bottom of first portion 18 of front plug shell insert 16. Preferably, the alignment sleeve 48 has a longitudinal cut 50 to allow squeezed insertion thereof in sleeve retainer 43 through reduced hole 47.<br>
The fibre optic male contacts 51 have a longitudinally spring biased elongated ferrule 52 (Figures 1 and 12) for centrally housing an end portion of a fibre optic core (not shown). The fibre optic male contacts 51 may be of any available design which is not part of this invention and will not be described in further detail.<br>
Each fibre optic male contact 51 is mounted in a plug 53 /Figures 1 and 12) adapted to be inserted into the rear plug shell insert 17 or rear socket shell insert 32, with the ferrule 52 protruding forwardly of the plug 53. The plug 53 has radially movable resilient latches 54 for insertion into the latch catching grooves 28, respectively 41, of the rear plug shell insert 17 and rear socket shell insert 32. Each latch 54 has an inclined surface 58. A control sleeve 55 is mounted for longitudinal movement on plug 53. Control sleeve 55 has a tubular portion 56 provided with a plurality of windows 57 respectively positioned over the latches 54. Upon rearward movement of control sleeve 55 on plug 53 the front wall 59 of windows 57 urge the inclined surfaces 58 inwardly against resiliency of latches 54 thereby retracting latches 54 radially out of the latch catching grooves 28, respectively 41, of the rear plug shell insert 17 and rear socket shell insert 32 and allowing removal of the plugs out of the inserts. The tubular portion 56 of control sleeve 55 further comprises a radial stud 60 for sliding fit insertion into longitudinal inner grooves 29. respectively 42, of rear plug shell insert 17 and rear socket shell insert 32. whereby the angular position of the plug is fixed with respect to said inserts.<br>
Upon assembly of plug shell 1 and socket shell 2 and insertion of plugs 53 into rear plug shell insert 17 and rear socket shell insert 32. the ferrules 52 of the fibre optic male contacts 51 penetrate into the fully floating alignment sleeve 48 while<br>
10<br><br>
WO 00/22469<br><br>
{"Cr/FJ,99/06405<br><br>
insertion of latches 54 into latch catching grooves 28 and 41 and insertion of radial studs 60 into longitudinal grooves 29 and 42 assure longitudinal and angular positioning of the plugs 53 in the rear plug shell insert 17 and rear socket shell insert 32. Front to front alignment of the ferrules is thus achieved. Angular position of the ferrules is determined by the stud 60 and longitudinal grooves 29 and 42 in view of the angular position selected for front plug shell insert 16 and rear socket shell insert 32. The latching mechanism of plugs 53 allows easy push-pull self-latching and disconnection of the plugs 53 into and from the inserts 17 and 32.<br>
Variants are available.<br>
For example, the connector system may use a standard two-part connector other than the DIN 41612 connector, the configuration of front and rear plug shell inserts and front and rear socket shell inserts being arranged to match with available configurations of the connector in order to achieve the same results as described.<br>
Though shown with two plugs for front to front alignment of the ferrules of two fibre optic male contacts, the connector system may be used for as many pairs of fibre optic male contacts as the standard connector has opposed cavities.<br>
Although the plug arrangement described is preferred because of its ease and safety of self-latching push-pull operation, other plugs enclosing the fibre optic male contacts may be used, for example plugs with clips for longitudinal positioning of the plug into the inserts or plugs with other latch control means than the windowed control sleeve shown, or still plugs without the stud for angular positioning. It is also possible not to use plugs as described, the body of the fibre optic male contacts being directly inserted and positioned within the inserts.<br>
The collar 40 of rear socket shell insert 32 may be other than square, for example hexagonal.<br>

The front socket shell insert 31 may have no second portion 35 interpenetrating the second portion 20 of front plug shell insert 16, the iatter having a correspondingly reduced inner diameter to properly house the tubular sleeve retainer 43. The embodiment shown is however preferred because of the precision of alignment it affords to the inserts of the plug shell and socket shell.<br>
It is also possible not to make use of the tubular sleeve retainer 43 for housing the floating alignment sleeve 48, the latter being housed directly in one of the front plug shell insert 16 and front socket shell insert 31 or in both of them.<br>
