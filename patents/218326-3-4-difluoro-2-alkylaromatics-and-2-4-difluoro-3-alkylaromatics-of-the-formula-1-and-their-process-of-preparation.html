				<td>difluoroalkylaromatics of the formula (I)<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
in which<br>
Het is NH2 or OH and the R1 radical is fluorine and the R2 radical is C1-C4-alkyl.<br>
Accordingly the present invention also relates to a process for preparing difluoroalkylaromatics of the formula (I).<br>
Difluoroalkvlaromatics<br>
The present invention relates to 3,4-difluoro-2-alkylaromatics and 2,4-difluoro-3-alkylaromatics, to a process for their preparation and to their use for preparing active ingredients.<br>
2,3,4-Trisubstituted aromatics, especially those which bear fluorine or fluorinated groups as substituents, are important building blocks for active ingredients in pharmaceuticals, in particular in active analgesic and antibacterial ingredients, and crop protection agents, in particular in herbicides and fungicides (see also EP-A 864 559, EP-A 609 798, WO 95/31446, EP-A 625 505, DE-A 36 157 67 and WO 98/46608).<br>
It is therefore desirable to provide 2,3,4-trisubstituted aromatics by which the lipophilicity of the entire active ingredient molecule and thus its effectiveness can be positively influenced and which can be used particularly widely as a synthetic building block.<br>
In addition, it is desirable to provide a process by which these 2,3,4-trisubstituted aromatics can be obtained in good yields starting from readily available reactants.<br>
For example, 2,4-difluoro-3-methylbenzoic acid is disclosed by WO 99/14214 and WO 99/35117. The preparation comprises first the reaction of 2,4-difluorobrombenzene with a strong base and a methylating reagent to give 2,6-difluoro-3-bromotoluene, and also the conversion to an organometallic reagent and subsequent treatment with carbon dioxide.<br>
According to DE-A 36 157 67, 2,4-difluoro-3-methylbenzoic acid is obtained by oxidizing 2,4-difluoro-3-methylacetophenone with bromine and sodium hydroxide solution.<br>
The preparation of 3,4-difluoro-2-methylbenzoic acid is disclosed, for example, by EP-A 609 798, WO 95/31446 and EP-A 625 505 and is effected by dilithiating 3,4-difluorbenzoic acid and subsequently reacting with methyl iodide.<br>
A disadvantage of the processes mentioned is the fact that the repeated use of organometallic reagents on the industrial scale is critical for safety reasons and very expensive overall, and the processes mentioned are different for each product.<br>

The stirrer was switched off, an iodine crystal was first added, then approx. 10 g of 3-bromo-2,6-difluorotoluene from Example 8 were added dropwise until the reaction commenced. Subsequently, the remaining 90 g of 3-bromo-2,6-difluorotoluene (a total of 483 mmol) were added dropwise with stirring within 65 min, in such a<br>
way that continuous gentle reflux was obtained (intrinsic heat). On completion of addition, stirring was continued until a clear solution was obtained. Subsequently, carbon dioxide was introduced for approx. 35 minutes until exothermicity could no longer be observed. 500 ml of water were cautiously added dropwise. The remaining Mg turnings were filtered off and the filtrate was acidified with approx. 250 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid (pH 1). The solid which precipitated out was filtered off with suction and dried under reduced pressure. Recrystallization from ethanol afforded 38 g of colourless solid; m.p.: 168 - 170°C.<br>

The mixture was heated to reflux for 18 hours. The resulting solid was filtered off and washed repeatedly with little methyl tert-butyl ether. The filtrate was admixed with 400 ml of water and the organic phase was removed. This again formed a precipitate which was filtered off with suction. The aqueous phase was extracted four times with approx. 200 ml each time of methyl tert-butyl ether. The combined organic phases were washed with sodium chloride solution, dried over magnesium sulphate and concentrated. After distillation and recrystallization from ethanol, 49 g of colourless crystals were obtained; m.p.: 40 - 44°C.<br>
Example 12<br>
Preparation of 2,4-difluoro-3-methylbenzaldehyde<br>
1.3 g (53 mmol) of magnesium were initially charged under nitrogen in 20 ml of tetrahydrofuran and stirred slowly overnight using a magnetic stirrer. The stirrer was switched off and an iodine crystal added to the solution. 10 g (48 mmol) of 3-bromo-2,4-difluorotoluene from Example 8 in 15 ml of tetrahydrofuran were then added dropwise at such a rate that continuous gentle reflux was<br>
obtained (intrinsic heat). On completion of addition, stirring was continued until a clear solution was obtained (approx. 2 hours). 7.1 g (97 mmol) of dimethylformamide in 35 ml of tetrahydrofuran were then added dropwise at room temperature within 100 minutes. The reaction mixture was heated to reflux for 4 hours, then hydrolysed by pouring onto ice-water. The remaining magnesium turnings were filtered off. The suspension was acidified using concentrated hydrochloric acid (pH 1). The aqueous phase was extracted 3 times with 50 ml each time of ethyl acetate. The combined organic phases were washed with 100 ml of saturated sodium chloride solution, dried and concentrated.<br>
The thus obtained crude product contained 12% of desired target product and higher molecular weight components.<br>
Example 13<br>
Preparation of 2,4-difluoro-3-methylbenzylamine<br>
8.8 g (58 mmol) of 2,4-difluoro-3-methylbenzonitrile from Example 11 were taken up under nitrogen in 70 ml of tetrahydrofuran. 4.4 g (116 mmol) of lithium aluminium hydride were added in portions to the solution and the mixture was subsequently stirred at room temperature for<br>
10	hours. Excess lithium aluminium hydride was hydrolysed by cautiously adding 150 ml of water<br>
and the precipitate which formed was filtered off. The resulting filtrate was washed with water and<br>
the combined organic phases were extracted with methyl tert-butyl ether. The combined organic<br>
phases were washed with saturated sodium chloride solution, dried over magnesium sulphate and<br>
concentrated.<br>

Example 14<br>
Preparation of 2,4-difluoro-3-methylbenzyI alcohol<br>
11	g (58 mmol) of 2,4-difluoro-3-methylbenzoyl chloride from Example 10 were initially charged<br>
under nitrogen in a mixture of 80 ml of dimethylformamide and 80 ml of tetrahydrofuran. 4.4 g<br>
(115 mmol) of sodium borohydride was added in portions and the mixture was subsequently left to<br>
stir at room temperature for 18 hours. The reaction mixture was admixed under ice cooling with<br>
200ml of ice-water and extracted three times with 100 ml each time of dichloromethane. The<br>
combined organic phases were dried over magnesium sulphate and concentrated.<br>
8.5 g of a colourless liquid were obtained and, according to GC-MS, contained 80% of the target product.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
1.         Difluoroalkylaromatics of the formula (I)<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
in which<br>
Het is NHa or OH and the R1 radical is fluorine   and the R2 radical is Ci-<br>
C4-alkyl.<br>
2. Difluoroalkylaromatics as claimed in claim 1, selected from 2,3-Difluro-4-methylbenzyl alcohol, 2,4-difluoro3-methylbenzyl alcohol, 2,3-difluoro-4-methylbenzylamine and 2,4-difluoro-3-methylbenzylarnine.<br>
3.         Process for preparing compounds of the formula (I) as claimed in claim 1, wherein<br>
•    in a step A)<br>
2,3-Difluoroalkylbenzene or 2,6-difluoroalkylbenzene of the formula (II)<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
are converted in the presence of bromine and a catalyst selected from iron and iron sulphide to 2-bromo-5,6-difluoroalkylbenzene or 3-bromo-2,6-difluoroalkylbenzene of the formula (III)<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
•    and, in the case that Het is OH,<br>
in a step Bl, the compounds of the formula (III) are converted by reaction with magnesium or Grignard reagents to an organomagnesium compound, reaction of this organomagnesium compound with carbon dioxide and subsequent treatment with acid to give 3,4-difluoro2-alkylbenzoic acid or 2,4-difluoro-3-alkylbenzoic acid of the formula (V)<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
and the compounds of formula (V),<br>
in a step B2, are converted using a halogenating agent selected from thionyl chloride, thionyl bromide, phosphorous oxychloride, phosphoryl chloride and phosgene to 3,4-difluoro-2-alkylbenzoylhalide or 2,4-difluoro-3-alkulnbenzoylhalide of the formula (VI)<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
in which Hal is chlorine or bromine<br>
and, in a step B3, the compounds of the formula (VI) are converted by reduction to the corresponding compounds of the formula (I).<br>
4.         Process as claimed in claim 3, wherein, optionally to the steps Bl to B3,<br>
