				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The subject of the invention is a transparent<br>
substrate, especially made of glass, which is coated<br>
with a thin -film multilayer, comprising at least one<br>
metal layer, for electromagnetic shielding.<br>
The invention will be more particularly described for<br>
the use such a substrate in a plasma display screen;<br>
however, it is not limited to such an application, it<br>
being possible for the substrate to be inserted into<br>
any electromagnetic shielding wall.<br>
A plasma display screen comprises a plasma gas mixture<br>
(Ne, Xe, Ar) trapped between two glass plates, and<br>
phosphors placed on the internal face of the rear plate<br>
of the display. Ultraviolet light radiation emitted by<br>
the plasma gas mixture during the plasma discharge<br>
between the two glass plates interacts with the<br>
phosphors on the internal face of the rear plate in<br>
order to produce the visible light radiation (red,<br>
green or blue). A gas particle deexcitation mechanism<br>
competes with the UV emission, which generates infrared<br>
radiation between 800 and 1250 nm, the propagation of<br>
which, mainly through the front face of the display,<br>
may be the source of very troublesome interference,<br>
especially as regards equipment located nearby and<br>
controlled by infrared, for example by means of remote<br>
controls.<br>
Moreover, like all electronic apparatus, plasma display<br>
screens possess addressing systems or drivers that may<br>
generate parasitic radiation which must not interfere<br>
with other	devices, such as microcomputers, mobile<br>
telephones, etc.<br>
To eliminate, or at the very least attenuate, the<br>
propagation of such radiation, one solution consists in<br><br>
placing against the front face of the display a window, also called a filter. Which<br>
is both transparent and metallized in order to provide electromagnetic shielding.<br>
This filter is, for example, a transparent substrate coated with thin silver - based<br>
layers that reflect the electromagnetic waves in the frequency range from 30 MHZ<br>
to GHZ and infrared beyond 800 nm.<br>
Thus, patent FR 2 641 272 proposes a substrate comprising a reflective silver<br>
layer sandwiched between a transparent sublayer that comprises at least one<br>
layer of a metal oxide, and a transparent covering layer that comprises a layer of<br>
sacrificial metal oxide, a zine oxide layer, the thickness of which does not exceed<br>
15 nm, and an upper covering layer of a metal oxide.<br>
The silver layer preferably has a thickness of between 8 to 12 nm.<br>
The metal oxide layer of the sublayer may be chosen from several oxide and<br>
may be a mixture of several oxides. A preferred example is a titanium dioxide<br>
layer and a tin oxide layer deposited on said titanium dioxide.<br>
The object of the sacrificial metal oxide is to protect the silver layer from<br>
oxidation, in particular during its deposition when this is carried out by the<br>
technique of sputtering. This is because, if the silver were to be impaired, the<br>
coated substrate would lose its low emissivity and its light transmission would be<br>
greatly reduced. The sacrificial metal often preferred is titanium, as it provides<br>
the silver with very effective protection against oxidation and has the advantage<br>
of being easily oxidized, to form an oxide of very low absorbency.<br>
The zinc oxide layer serves as protection against the<br><br>
penetration of oxygen into the lower layers and allows the thickness of sacrificial<br>
metal to the reduced somewhat, this metal then being more easily, more<br>
completely requires a limited thickness for the zinc oxide layer of 15 nm, in<br>
particular so as to give the layer good light transmission properties.<br>
However, such a substrate with a single metal layer is not suitable for obtaining<br>
sufficient electromagnetic shielding, such as to have a surface resistance of less<br>
than 1.8 Ω/□ Furthermore, other patent applications propose multilayers<br>
containing a plurality of metal layers, in particular silver layers. However, it is<br>
known that increasing the number of layers reduces the light transmission; a<br>
compromise between thicknesses and types of layer must therefore be found in<br>
order to achieve satisfactory light transmission.<br>
The patent application published under WO 01/81262 proposes a multiplayer<br>
having two layers, with a thickness e1 in the case of the silver layer closest to the<br>
substrate and a thickness e2 for the other layer, a sacrificial metal oxide, such as<br>
titanium oxide, being placed above each silver layer in order to protect it.<br>
One example of a sequence is the following:<br>
substrate/ Si3N4/ZnO/Ag/Ti/ Si3N4/ZnO/Ag/Ti/ ZnO/Si3N4.<br>
To achieve a surface resistance of less than 1.8 Ω/Ω/□ while still maintaining a<br>
suitable tight transmission, the ratio of the thickness e1/e2 is between 0.8 and<br>
1.1, preferably between 0.9 and 1, and the total thickness of the metal layers, e1<br>
+ e2, is between 27.5 and 30 nm, preferably between 28 and 29.5 nm.<br>
European patent application EP 1 155 816 discloses a multiplayer having three,<br>
or even four, silver layers with an alternation of a titanium oxide layer and of a<br>
layer having a refractive index of less than 2.4 at a<br><br>
wavelength of 550 nm, such as for example zinc oxide or<br>
preferably silica nitride. The thickness of the silver<br>
layer closest to the substrate and of that furthest<br>
away is preferably equal to 0.5 to 1 times the<br>
thickness of the other silver layer. An example of a<br>
sequence having a surface resistance of 1.5 Ω/⁪ with<br>
a light transmission of 67%, is given with three<br>
palladium-doped silver layers each having a thickness<br>
of 16 nm. This sequence is the following:<br>
substrate/TiOx/SiNx/Ag/SiNx/TiOx/SiNx/Ag/SiNx/TiOx/<br>
SiNx/Ag/SiNx/TiOx.<br>
However, it is always desirable for the properties of<br>
existing solutions to be further improved, and thus<br>
obtain an even more substantial reduction in surface<br>
resistance without degrading the light transmission.<br>
The object of the invention is therefore to find<br>
another filter solution, especially for a plasma<br>
display screen, in order to alleviate the problem of<br>
electromagnetic wave transmission, while still<br>
achieving satisfactory optical properties.<br>
According to the invention, the transparent substrate,<br>
especially made of glass, provided with a thin -film<br>
multilayer that includes three silver layers and<br>
comprises, alternately on the substrate, a<br>
titanium dioxide layer, a metal oxide layer, one of the<br>
silver layers and a covering layer, characterized in<br>
that:<br>
the metal oxide is zinc oxide;<br>
the covering layer is a sacrificial metal; and<br>
an antireflection layer comprising at least one<br>
metal oxide is deposited on the covering layer for the<br>
silver layer furthest away from the substrate.<br>
According to one feature, the thickness of each of the<br>
silver layers is between 13 nm and 19 nm. The<br>
thicknesses (e Ag1, eAg2, eAg3) of the three respective<br><br>
layers (Ag1, Ag2, Ag3) are identical, or else they vary<br>
in a ratio of between 0.8 and 1.2 and are such that<br>
eAgl ≤ eAg3 ≤ eAg2 •<br>
According to another feature, the titanium dioxide<br>
layer as sublayer for the silver layer (Ag 1) closest to<br>
the substrate has a thickness of between 10 and 20 nm,<br>
preferably between 10 and 15 nm, and the titanium oxide<br>
layers as sublayers for the other two silver layers<br>
(Ag2, Ag3) have a thickness of between 35 and 55 nm,<br>
preferably between 40 and 50 nm.<br>
Preferably, the zinc oxide layer has a thickness of<br>
greater than 15 nm.<br>
Advantageously, the sacrificial metal layer is of<br>
niobium, titanium or zirconium, and has a thickness not<br>
exceeding 2 nm.<br>
According to another feature, the antireflection layer<br>
has a thickness of between 25 and 50 nm, preferably<br>
between 25 and 35 nm. Advantag eously, this<br>
antireflection layer includes at least one titanium<br>
dioxide layer having a thickness of between 15 and<br>
3 5 nm, preferably between 2 0 and 3 0 nm, and may also<br>
include another layer of a metal oxide that is<br>
deposited on said titanium dioxide layer and has a<br>
thickness of between 5 and 15 nm, preferably between 6<br>
and 10 nm. This metal oxide layer is preferably tin<br>
oxide (SnO2) or silicon nitride (Si3N4) .<br>
With such features, the substrate according to the<br>
invention has a surface resistance not exceed ing<br>
1 Ω/□, preferably between 0.7 and 0.9 Ω/□.<br>
The substrate may be made of toughened or untoughened<br>
glass, or made of plastic.<br>
It will be advantageous to use such a substrate in an<br><br>
electromagnetic shielding filter, applied for example<br>
to a display scree n of the plasma display type,. This<br>
filter therefore comprises a substrate provided with<br>
the multilayer of the invention, together with one or<br>
more functional plastic sheets (for example with<br>
pigments or dyes) and/or another transparent substrate,<br>
optionally coated with an antireflection layer, so as<br>
to have the following optical properties:<br>
a light transmission factor T L of between 45<br>
and 55%;<br>
a purity of less than 10% in transmission;<br>
a light reflection R L of less than 5%,<br>
preferably less than 4%;<br>
a predominantly violet-blue color in reflection<br>
with a purity of less than 20%;<br>
a predominantly blue color in transmission.<br>
Other features and advantages of the invention will now<br>
be described with regard to the appended drawings, in<br>
which:<br>
figure 1 illustrates a first embodiment of an<br>
electromagnetic shielding filter;<br>
figure 2 illustrates a second embodiment of an<br>
electromagnetic shielding filter; and<br>
figure 3 illustrates schematically the<br>
multilayer of the invention.<br>
It should firstly be pointed out that the proportions<br>
relating to the various dimensions, especially<br>
thicknesses, of the elements of the invention have not<br>
been drawn to scale in the figures so that they are<br>
easier to read.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates a first example of an embodime nt<br>
of the transparent structure 1 intended to be joined to<br>
the front face of a plasma display in order to form an<br>
optical and electromagnetic shielding filter.<br>
The structure 1 comprises a first transparent substrate<br><br>
10, which for example is of the glass t ype but which<br>
could, as a variant, be made of plastic, intended to be<br>
placed on the same side as the display, a thin -film<br>
multilayer 20 according to the invention, which is<br>
placed on the internal face of the substrate 10, facing<br>
the inside of the structure , a second substrate 3 0 of<br>
the glass type, which is joined to the first substrate,<br>
facing the multilayer 20, by means of a plastic film<br>
40, such as a PVB film. This functional plastic film<br>
may advantageously include a mineral pigment or an<br>
organic dye so a s to filter the orange color of<br>
wavelength centered on 590 nm. The reader may refer for<br>
further details about the plastic film or alternative<br>
embodiments of the structure to French patent<br>
application FR 03/04636.<br>
The external faces of the substrates 10 an d 30 to the<br>
outside of the structure are preferably provided with<br>
an antireflection coating 50.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates a second example of an embodiment<br>
of the structure 1, which in this case comprises a<br>
substrate 10 one of the faces of which, intended to b e<br>
on the opposite side from the observer, is provided<br>
with the thin -film multilayer 20, and a substrate 60<br>
made of plastic, such as PET, which is intended to be<br>
placed on the same side as the display and is joined to<br>
the substrate 10, facing the multilayer 20, by means of<br>
a plastic film 40, such as a PVB film, which may<br>
advantageously incorporate other functionalities as<br>
described above in the first embodiment. The external<br>
face of the substrate 10, to the outside of the<br>
structure, is preferably provided wi	than<br>
antireflection coating 50.<br>
The invention therefore relates to the multilayer 2 0<br>
deposited on a substrate, such as the substrate 10.<br>
This multilayer includes three metallic silver layers,<br>
Ag1 being the layer closest to the substrate, Ag 2 being<br><br>
the central layer and Ag 3 being the one furthest away,<br>
the function of which is to reflect the electromagnetic<br>
waves having a frequency between 3 0 MHz and 1 GHz and<br>
infrared waves beyond 800 nm.<br>
The multilayer includes, deposited alternately on the<br>
substrate, a titanium dioxide layer 21, a layer 22 of a<br>
metal oxide, consisting of zinc oxide, one of the<br>
silver layers Ag 1, Ag 2 or Ag 3, and a layer 23 of a<br>
sacrificial metal coating. Deposited on top of the<br>
sacrificial metal layer 23, which is deposited on the<br>
silver layer Ag 3 furthest from the substrate, is an<br>
antireflection layer 24 consisting of at least one<br>
metal oxide.<br>
The thickness of each of the silver layers Ag 1, Ag2 and<br>
Ag3 is between 13 nm and 19 nm. The thicknesses e Agl,<br>
eAg2 and e Ag3 of the respective lay ers Ag1, Ag 2 and Ag 3<br>
may be identical or they may vary in a ratio of between<br>
0.8 and 1.2 and are such that e Ag1 ≤ eAg3 ≤eAg2. The<br>
imbalance in layer thicknesses is preferential, so as<br>
to lower the light reflection while maintaining the<br>
same surface resistance.<br>
The titanium oxide layer 21 as sublayer for the silver<br>
layer Ag 1 close to the substrate has a thickness of<br>
between 10 and 20 nm, preferably between 10 and 15 nm.<br>
The titanium oxide layers 21 as sublayers for the other<br>
two silver layers Ag 2 and Ag 3 have a thickness of<br>
between 35 and 55 nm, preferably between 40 and 50 nm.<br>
The zinc oxide layer 22 preferably has a thickness of<br>
greater than 15 nm, for example 16 or 18 nm.<br>
The sacrificial metal layer 23 is of niobium, titanium<br>
or zirconium, preferably titanium, and has a thickness<br>
of at most 2 nm, for example 1.5 nm.<br><br>
This sacrificial metal layer makes it possible to<br>
protect the silver against oxidation, and to improve<br>
its resistivity. Although the presence of titanium may<br>
degrade the light transmission , it does allow an even<br>
lower surface resistance to be obtained, while<br>
maintaining a sufficiently correct light transmission.<br>
The compromise to be found between the optical<br>
properties of the filter and its shielding properties<br>
is provided by giving prefere nCe to shielding, while<br>
still maintaining good optical properties. Thus, with<br>
the sequence of the invention based on three silver<br>
layers, the surface resistance drops to 0.8 Ω/□,<br>
instead of 1.5 according to the prior art, which not<br>
only meets Class A of Eu ropean Standard EN 55022,<br>
dealing with what are called "consumer" products, but<br>
also Class B, dealing with special products of the<br>
home-cinema type.<br>
The antireflection layer 24 for the silver layer Ag 3<br>
remote from the substrate has a thickness of between 2 5<br>
and 50 nm, preferably between 25 and 35 nm. It<br>
comprises at least titanium dioxide with a thickness of<br>
between 15 and 35 nm, preferably between 20 and 30 nm.<br>
Advantageously, deposited on top of the titanium<br>
dioxide of this antireflection layer is anoth er metal<br>
oxide, of small thickness, between 5 and 15 nm, and<br>
preferably between 6 and 10 nm. This metal oxide is,<br>
for example, tin oxide (SnO 2) or silica nitride: (Si 3N4)<br>
- which helps to improve the purity of the colors in<br>
reflection and in transmission.<br>
All the layers of the multilayer are deposited on the<br>
substrate by the known technique of sputtering.<br>
In the table below, we given give five examples (Ex 1<br>
to Ex 5) of the multilayer 20 of the invention.<br>
Provided in the table are the thicknesses (in ran) o f<br>
each layer and, for each multilayer joined to a<br><br>
substrate 10, the values of the light transmission T L<br>
(in %), the light reflection R L (in %), the purity in<br>
transmission pe in T (in %) , the purity in reflection pe<br>
in R (in %) , the dominant wavelengths in transmission<br>
and in reflection, respectively λd in T and λd in R (in<br>
nm) and the surface resistance RSUrf (in Ω/□) .<br>
These five examples make it possible to achieve<br>
suitable shielding less than 1 Ω/□.<br>
In the case of examples 1, 2 and 5, the silver layers<br>
are the same and equal to 15 nm; the zinc oxide<br>
thicknesses are different, with a thickness of less<br>
than 15 nm, exactly equal to 10 nm in the case of<br>
example 5. For each example, the thickness of the<br>
titanium dioxide layers is fixed so as to optimize the<br>
optical properties of the multilayer.<br>
The results show that, for examples 1 and 2 which have<br>
larger zinc oxide thicknesses than example 5 (from 6 to<br>
8 nm and higher), the light transmission, contrary to<br>
what might be expected as regards the prior art,<br>
remains substantially the same and even slightly better<br>
in the case of example 1 with a zinc oxide thickness of<br>
18 nm, and the reflection has the advantage, in the<br>
case of examples 1 and 2, of being lower than in the<br>
case of example 5, thereby making it possib le for the<br>
display to be illuminated less brightly and<br>
aggressively for the observer.<br>
Examples 3 and 4 provide a comparison, with unequal<br>
thicknesses as regards the silver layers, with, in the<br>
case of example 4, an antireflection layer 25 based on<br>
SnO2. I t may be seen that the imbalance has the<br>
advantage of reducing the light reflection but has the<br>
drawback of increasing the purity in transmission and<br>
in reflection; the addition of the antireflection layer<br>
helps to overcome this drawback and thus obtain a<br>
purity in transmission equivalent or substantially<br><br>
equivalent to that of examples 1, 2 and 5, and to<br>
reduce the purity in reflection compared with that of<br>
example 3.<br><br>
Thus, by controlling the deposition of the silver and<br>
dielectric 1 ayers and the thicknesses formulated<br>
according to the invention, and also by the use of<br>
metal protection layers, the filter obtained with<br>
reference to figure 1 or figure 2 has the following<br>
properties:<br>
a surface resistance of less than 1 Ω/⁬;<br>
a light transmission factor T L of between 45<br>
and 55%;<br>
a purity in transmission of less than 10%;<br>
a light reflection R L of less than 5%,<br><br>
preferably less than 4%;<br>
a predominantly violet-blue color in reflection<br>
with a purity of less than 2 0%; and<br>
a predominantly blue color in transmission.<br>
The electromagnetic shielding filter using the<br>
substrate of the invention may be applied to a display<br>
screen, in particular a plasma display. It provides<br>
very good performance as regards shielding (the surface<br>
resistance being less than 1 Ω/□) , and it consequently<br>
blocks especially infrared with a transmission at<br>
900 nm that does not exceed 1%. This filter alsc&gt;<br>
provides good visibility - a light transmission factor<br>
between 45 and 55% - and improves the contrast of the<br>
display.<br><br>
