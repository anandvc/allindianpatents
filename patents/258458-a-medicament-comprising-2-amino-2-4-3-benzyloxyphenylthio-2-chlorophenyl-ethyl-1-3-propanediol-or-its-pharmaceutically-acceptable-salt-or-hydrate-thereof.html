EFFECTIVE USE METHOD OF MEDICAMENTS AND METHOD OF PREVENTING EXPRESSION OF SIDE EFFECT [Technical field] [0001]<br>
Thepresent invention relates tomedicaments comprising diaryl sulfide or diaryl ether compound having a 2-amino-l,3-procanediol structure having an activity of reducing lymphocytes circulating peripherally, in combination with an imr.unosuppressive ager.i and/or an anti-inflammatory agent, and also ~o methods which make immunosuppressive activity or anti-inflammatory activity effectively express and reduce expression of side effect. [Background art] [0002]<br>
Development of a method of suppressing immune response is very important for preventing rejection response in organ or cell transplantation, and treating and preventing various autoimmune diseases.  Compounds that are conventionally used for suppression<br>
Vr<br>
of immune response are based on either mechanism of action: (1) attacking a specific immune cell to remove the cell from the immune system, or (2) inhibiting the ability of ar. immune cell to respond to cytokine, thereby reducing the number of cells involved ir. immune response. As the number of responding cells reduces, the immune system is disabled to give a normal responding reaction, so that the immune response is suppressed.<br><br>
[0003]<br>
To be more specific, the group of compounds based on the first mechanism of action will inhibit nucleotide synthesis in immune cells and stop metabolism and immune activity of the cells. This group includes azathioprine (Non-patent document 1), mizoribine (Non-patent document 2), mycophenolic acid (hereinafter, also abbreviated as "MPA, " Non-patent docurr.ent 3),. brequinar sodium (Non-patent document 4), leflunomide, ar.d methotrexate.  However, these compounds face the problem that they are likely to cause toxic side effects. [0004]<br>
The group of compounds based on the second mechanism of action includes cyclosporine A (hereinafter also abbreviated as "CsA"), tacrolimus (hereinafter also abbreviated as "FK506") and rapamycin (Non-patent document 5) and the like. These compounds will inhibit synthesis of cytokine such as IL-2, to thereby disable induction of proliferation and differentiation of effecter cells and inhibit immune response. On the other hand, rapamycin blocks a cytokine signal from acting on an immune cell. [0005]<br>
In order to mitigate side effects associated with individual immunosuppressive agents, therapies using either CsA or FK506, together with other immunosuppressive agent such as azar.hioprine<br>
*<br>
or mizoribine or steroids (Non-patent document 6), (Non-patent document 7) or steroids have widely conducted, however, they do<br><br>
lot always show sufficient immunosuppressive effect without representing toxic side effects.<br>
[0006]<br>
As to an amino propanediol derivative having immunosuppressive 5  activity, combinational effect of FTY720 and calcineurin inhibitor<br>
is known (Patent document 1) .  However, it is important to develop<br>
new agents for better expression of action or for reduction of side<br>
effect.<br>

[Disclosure of the invention] 20   [Problem to be solved by the invention]<br>
[0007]<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a method<br>
of efficiently eliciting effect of an immunosuppressive agent or<br>
an anti-inflammatory agent, i.e., immunosuppressive activity or 25  anti-inflammatory activity at maximum while reducing side effect<br><br>
'of the immunosuppressive agent or the anti-inflammatory agent by combinational use of an immunosuppressive agent or an anti-inflammatory agent known in the art which by itself has low toxicity and can be used with safety and without occurrence of side effect.<br>
[Means for solving the problem] [0008]<br>
The inventors of the present invention found that use of diaryl sulfide or diaryl ether compound having a 2-amino-l,3-propanediol structure having an activity of reducing lymphocytes circulating peripherally, in combination with other immunosuppressive agent or anti-inflammatory agent allows effective expression of immunosuppressive activity or anti-inflammatory activity of the combined agent and that side effects can be reduced by reducing an amount which is enough to express an effect of the combined agent, and finally accomplished the present invention. [0009]<br>
Specifically, the present invention relates to:<br>
1)	A medicament comprising diaryl sulfide or diaryl ether<br>
compound having a 2-amino-l,3-propanediol structure having an<br>
activity of reducing lymphocytes circulating peripherally, in<br>
combination with an immunosuppressive agent and/or<br>
anti-inflammatory agent,<br>
2)	The medicament according to.the above 1) , wherein the diaryl<br>

8 ) A met hod for preventing expression of side effect by applying a medicament comprising diary! sulfide or diaryl ether compound having a 2-amine-l,3-propanediol structure having an activity of reducing lymphocytes circulat ing peripherally, in combination with immunosuppressive agent and/or anti-inflammatory agent, thereby mutually enhancing efficacies of these agents, and reducing use amounts.<br><br>
Effect of the invention] [0012]<br>
Although diaryl sulfide or diaryl ether compound having a 2-amino-l,3-propanediol structure having an ability to reduce lymphocytes circulating pherioherally exerts excellent immunosuppressive effect by itself, combinational use with CsA or FK506 which is a calcineurin inhibitor mutually enhances immunosuppressive effects of these agents .  As a result, a use amount of calcineurin inhibitor can be reduced, and limitation in clinical application due to renal toxicity or liver toxicity of CsA or FK506 can be disposed of, so that a safe and effective therapeutic method canbe provided. Also combinational use withmycophenolic acid (MPA) having an activity of inhibiting nucleoside synthesis to stop metabolism and immune activity of immune cells allows mutual enhancement of immunosuppressive effects of both agents.  This in turn reduces a use amount of MPA and avoids expression of digestive symptoms such as diarrhea or nausea, pancytopenia or neutropenia, secondary infection, or lymphoma, and provides safe and satisfactory therapy.  Furthermore, the same applies to using the compound of the present invention in combination with methotrexate which is a first-line agent in therapy of rheumatoid arthritis.  In other words, diaryl sulfide or diaryl ether compound having a 2-amino-l, 3-propanediol structure having an activity of reducing lymphocytes circulating peripherally by itself exhibits excellent effect of suppressing occurrence of arthritis in an adjuvant<br><br>
arthritis model, however, when it is used in combination with methotrexate, their effects are mutually enhanced, and progression<br>
of arthritis can be suppressed by combination of smaller amounts of these agents. Methotrexate has strong side effects, so that low-level pulse therapy is employed in therapy of rheumatoid arthritis.  However, according to the method of the present application, dose of methotrexate can be reduced, and a safe therapeutic method capable of avoiding side effects can be provided. In brief, since methotrexate expresses its effect in a small amount, the agent can be used safely over a prolonged period, and efficient and sustained suppression of progression and recurrence df condition of rheumatoid arthritis is expected.

[0033] Examples<br>
In the following, the present invention will be concretely explained by way of examples.  In these examples, among compounds represented by the general formula, combinations of 2-amino-2-[4-(3-benzyloxyphenylthio)-2-chlorophenyl]ethyi-1,3-propanediol (hereinafter, abbreviated as "KNF-299") and cyclosporin A (CsA), tacrclimus (FK506), methotrexate(MTX) and myccphenolic acid (MPA) will be particularly described, however, it is to be understood that the preser.t invention will never be limited to these examples.<br>
[Example 1]<br>
[0034]<br><br>
Prolonging effect on skin allograft survival between major histocompatibility complex (MHC) compatible rat strains<br>
Allogeneic skin transplantation between MHC-compatible rats was conducted in the manner as described below with reference to, for example, the literatures (A.m. J. Med. Technol.; 36, 149-157, 1970, Transplant. Proc.; 28, 1056-1059, 1996).  Five animals were included per group, and all rats were bread in separate cages. LEW(RT11) was selected as donor, and F344 (RTllvl) was selected as recipient.  A part of dermis (1.8 x 1.8 cm) on the back of recipient was excised, ana after giving several drops of penicillin sclution (40,000 U/mL, in saline) thereon, a full thickness skin graft (1.8 x 1.8 cm) prepared from abdominal part of donor was put thereon. First-aid adhesive tape (30 x 72 mm) was applied so that the center pad thereof lies on the graft, and secured by binding aeration tape (adhesive bandacie, 3. 8*15 cm) therearound.  At 5 days, the first-aid adhesive tape and the aeration tape were removed by cutting with scissors. [0035]<br>
Drug administration was conducted by orally administering rj. 5 mL/lOOg B.W. of drug once a day everyday from the day cf skin transplantation. Control group was received distilled water. As the CsA, Sandimmun injection (50 rng/mL) diluted in distilled water was administered. As the FK506, the filling of Prograf capsule (Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.) suspended in distilled water was administered. KNF-299 was administered after being dissolved<br><br>
in distilled water. A combinational administration group was received a mixture prepared by mixing liquids to be administered right before administration. [0036]<br>
Grafts wereobservedeveryday f rom fifth day of transplantation at which the first-aid adhesive tape was removed, and the condition that 90% or more of graft epithelium necrotized to turn brown was determined as occurrence of rejection.  Number of days from transplantation to determination of rejection was defined as a survival time. [0037]'<br>
Mean value of survival times for each group was calculated as ameansurvival time (MST) .  Ineachgroup (n = 5) , the third-longest survival time was defined as a median value. [0038]<br>
KNF-299 showed the prolonging effect on the mean survival time for 27 days or more by single administration of 3 mg/kg.  Prolonging effect on survival for 30 days or more was observed by single administrations of CsA and FK506 in doses of 30 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, respectively. [0039]<br>
Table 1 shews results of the rest for demonstrating combinational use effect using a dose which is smaller than the dose at which survival prolonging effect was observed in single administration.<br><br>
KNF-299 showed clear prolonging effect on graft survival in single administration of 3 mg/kg. Also CsA showed clear survival prolonging effect in single administration of 30 mg/kg. Dosages of CsA 10 mg/kg and KNF-299 0.03 mg/kg merely resulted in about 1 to 4 days prolonging of survival compared to control, however, when they are used in combination, 30 days or longer prolonging of survival was observed in every case, and excellent rejection suppressing effeci was induced. The combination with FK506 gave similar results, and little effect was observed in single administration of low dose, however, the combinational use group of FK506 3 mg/kg and NF-299 0.1 mg/kg showed a clear combinational effect as is evident from a mean survival time of 26 days or longer. [0040] fTable 1]<br>
Table 1: Prolonging effect on skin allograft survival between MHC-compatible ra<br><br>
(Table Remove)<br>
[0041]<br>
As described above, it was demonstrated that combinational<br>
use of KNF-299 enhances the effect of a calcineurin inhibitor such as CsA or FK506. Since the use amount of the calcineurin inhibitor canbe reduced, the possibility of eliminating limitation in clinical application due to expression of renal toxicity or liver toxicity,<br>
and an effective therapeutic method is provided.<br>
[Example 2]<br>
[0042]<br>
Effect of combined use with methotrexa_e (MTX) in rat adjuvant<br>
arthritis (AA) model<br>
In a footpad of right hind limb of 6 or 7-week-old female LEW/Cr j rat (Charles River Japan, Inc.), 0.05 ml (0.6 mg/animal) of killed M.butyricum (12 mg/mL) suspended in liquid paraffin was intradermally injected to cause arthritis (Day 0) . Test compound was dissolved or suspended in pure water and orally administered in a volume of 0.5 mL per 100 g of body weight of rat.  Adjuvant control was received only pure water.  As for the combinational administration group, an aqueous solution of KNF-299 and an aqueous solution of MTX(Sigma) were administered after being mixed before administration.  Administration was conducted once a day everyday from Day 0 to end of the experiment. [0043]<br>
Evaluation of arthritis was made by measuring volumes of left and right hind limbs by using a volume meter (MK-550, Muromachi<br>
Kikai) at Day 0, 3, 8, 14, 17, and 21, and determining an increase<br>
relative to hind limb at Day 0.<br>
[0044]<br>
The ability of KNF-299 to prevent onset of adjuvant arthritis is dose dependent and reaches almost maximum at 0.1 mg/kg (Fig. 1) .  The ability of MTX to prevent onset was not observed at 0.03 mg/kg, and reached maximum at 0.1 mg/kg (Fig. 2). [0045]<br>
Combinational effect was examined for a combination of doses with which little effect was expected in single administrations. Dose of KNF-299 was 0.01 mg/kg and dose of MTX was 0.025 mg/kg and 0.05 mg/kg.  Results are shown in Fig. 3. [0046]<br>
MTX showed 21% and 35% inhibition in single administrations of 0.025 mg kg and 0.05 mg/kg, respectively, however the effect was not significant (Day21). KNF-299showed 36% (Day21) inhibition in single administration of 0.01 mg/kg. Combinational use of 0.01 mg/kg of KNF-299, and MTX presented an effect of combinational use, and combinational v.se with 0.05 mg/kg of MTX shoved 84% inhibition. [0047]<br>
MTX is a folic acid metabolism antagonist, and is known to cause myelcsuppression, interstitial pneumonia and the like side effects.  KNF-299 v:as demonstrated that it exhibits excellent combinational effect on AA model by combinational use with MTX which has the best clinical efficacy and hence is a first-line therapy.<br>
Therefore, combinational use of KNF-299 would be effective on a patient suffering from intractable rheumatoid arthritis for which effect of MTX is difficult to appear.  MTX has strong side effects, so that low-level pulse therapy is employed in therapy of rheumatoid arthritis. Also in this case, a side effect may occur, and thus folic acid is used in combination to mitigate such side effect. Combinational use of KNF-299 with MTX allows reduction in dose amounts of MTX and KNF-299, and prevents side effects, and enables provision of a safe therapeutic method. [Example 3] [0048]<br>
Prolonging effect of combinational use with mycophenolic acid (MPA) on survival of heart graft between major histocompatibility complex (MHC) incompatible rat strains<br>
Effect of KNF-299 was examined in allogeneic heart transplantation between MHC-incomcatible rats.  Using combination of DA(RT1'J) rat as a donor, and LEW(RT11) rat as a recipient, heterotopic heart transplantation in which heart of donor is joined to neck vessel of recipient with a cuff was conducted with reference to a literature (Microsurgery; 21,16-21, 2001) or the like.<br>
Drug was administered orally once a day everyday fror. the day of heart transplantation.  MPA was prepared from the product purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. so chat the concentration was 20 mg/mL in a saline containing 0 . 5% carboxymethyl<br>
cellulose, 0.4%Tween80, and 0 . 9% benzyl alcohol, and administered in 0.I mL/lOOgB.W..<br>
KNF-299 was dissolved in distilled water in a concentration of 0. 06mg/mL, and administered in0.5mL/100gB.W.. A control group was received a vehicle used for MPA administration liquid.<br>
Cardiac pulsation of the transplanted heart was checked by inspection or palpation, and determination of rejection was made when cardiac pulsation stopped.  Number of days from transplantation to. determination c £ rejection was defined as survival time.  Mean value of survival rime in each group was calculated as mean survival time (MST) .  Table 2 'shows results of the test for demonstrating preventing effect on rejection of transplanted heart using a combination of strains that showed strong rejection. [0049] [Table 2]<br>
Table 2: Prolonging effect on heart graft survival between MHC-incompatible rat strains<br>
Compound	Survival time (day) of transplanted heart<br>
(mg/kg. oral administration)    N	individual survival day	MST<br>

[0050]<br>
In single administration of 0.3 mg/kg of KNF-299, the mean survival time was 7.0 days, and only a small prolonging effect of 1.2 days compared to control group was observed.  In single administration of 20 mg/kg of MPA, individual variability in survival<br>
'time was large and rejection preventing effect was insufficient in spite of high dose. When they are used in combination, survival time was prolonged by 100 days or longer in every case, which revealed clear combinational use effect. [Industrial applicability] [0051]<br>
In organ transplantations, diaryl sulfide or diaryl ether compound having a 2-amino-l,3-propaneciol structure having an activity of reducing lymphocytes circulating peripherally exerts excellent immunosuppressive effect by itself, however, combinational use of a'n immunosuppressive agent such as CsA or FK506 which is a calcineurin inhibitor, or mycrphenolic acid (MPA) which is a nucleoside synthesis inhibitor or combinational use of an anti-inflammatory agent enhances the effect. Therefore, clinical doses of CsA, FK506, mycophenolate mofetil can be reduced, and hence limitation in using calcineurin inhibitors due to renal toxicity or liver toxicity, or limitation in using nucleoside synthesis inhibitors due to neutrophil depletion can be avoided, so that a safe and effective therapeutic method oan be provided.  Also in therapy of rheumatoid arthritis, dose of ir.ethotrexate can be reduced according to the method of the present application, so that a safe therapeutic method avoiding side effects /an be provided.  In brief, since the agents used in combination express sufficient anti-inflammatory effect with small amounts, such agents can be used safely over a prolonged period, and he:ice efficient and sustained<br><br>
suppression of progression and recurrence of condition of rheumatoid<br>
arthritis is expected. [0052]<br>
Therefore, the medicament of the present invention comprising diaryl sulfide or diaryl ether compound having a 2-amino-l,3-propanediol structure having an activity of reducing lymphocytes circulating peripherally, in combination with an immunosuppressive agent and/or an anti-inflammatory agent is useful as a measure for effectively expressing immunosuppressive activity or anti-inflammatory activity and reducing expression of side effect. Such a medicament is useful for prophylaxis and treatment of autoimmune diseases and inflammations caused by pathogenic microorganisms, foreign antigens or foreign substances, as well as for prophylaxis and treatment of inflammatory, proliferative and hyperproliferative skin diseases and immunogen-mediated diseases appearing in skin.<br><br><br><br>
