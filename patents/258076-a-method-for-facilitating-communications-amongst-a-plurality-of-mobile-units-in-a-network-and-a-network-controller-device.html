Field of the Invention<br>
[0001]	The invention relates generally to communication systems and more<br>
particularly to transmitting messages in commnnication networks.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
[0002]	Systems and methods for transmitting communications within wireless<br>
networks and between wireless networks are well known. In one example, a call from<br>
a user at a source mobile unit is transmitted across a wireless network to another user<br>
at a destination mobile unit. The wireless network is typically grouped into one or<br>
more geographic organizational units called cells, where the destination mobile unit<br>
may reside. The network routes the call across the wireless network using a wireless<br>
infrastructure and according to various messaging techniques and technologies that<br>
are well-known in the wireless technology field.<br>
(0003]	Wireless or cellular calls may be classified as being of several different<br>
types. For example, a cellular call may be a point-to-point call between two wireless<br>
users, In this case, conventional wireless transmission techniques are used to send the<br>
message between the two users. In another example, the cellular call may be a group<br>
call between multiple users. In this case, known techniques are used to form and<br>
conduct a group call using the cells in the network.<br>
[0004]	Wireless systems can be easily modified to provide higher capacities<br>
for point-to-point calls because the capacity of the system can be easily increased to<br>
virtually any value without shrinking the size of cells in the network. In contrast, in<br>
known systems performing group communications, it is necessary to decrease the cell<br>
size to increase capacity. In addition, group calls use a service manager (voice<br>
channel) in each cell that is occupied by one or more group members. Shrinking the<br>
size of the ceils to increase capacity tends to increase the number of cells activated for<br>
each call. Therefore, additional overhead is created in the system further slowing<br>
communications. Thus, present systems do not process both group calls and point-to-<br>
point calls in a convenient and efficient manner.<br><br>

[0012]	Skilled artisans will appreciate that elements in the figures are<br>
illustrated for simplicity and clarity and have not necessarily been drawn to scale. For<br>
example, the dimensions of some of the elements in the figures may be exaggerated<br>
relative to other elements to help to improve understanding of various embodiments<br>
of the present invention. Also, common but well-understood elements that axe useful<br>
or necessary in a commercially feasible embodiment are typically not depicted in<br>
order to facilitate a less obstructed view of these various embodiments of the present<br>
invention.<br><br>
Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
[0013]	Pursuant to many of these embodiments, a system and method for<br>
facilitating group communications is provided. In many of the embodiments, an<br>
overlay cell is provided that provides for group communications amongst mobile units<br>
in underlying underlay cells. The system and method establishes and allows group<br>
communications to proceed in an efficient and convenient manner. The system and<br>
method also allows point-to-point communications to occur without altering the<br>
structure or way these point-to-point communications are made.<br>
[0014]	In one approach, a plurality of underlay communication cells is<br>
established. Two mobile units reside in selected ones of the plurality of underlay<br>
communication cells and these mobile units may move between the various underlay<br>
communication cells. An overlay communication cell is established and covers the<br>
same area as at least some: of the underlay communication cells, including the<br>
underlay communication cells that where the two mobile units are located.<br>
[0015]	An association is established between each of the underlay cells that<br>
include the two mobile units and the overlay communication cell. For instance, a<br>
pointer may be configured in the underlay cell to point to a control channel in the<br>
overlay cell.<br>
[0016]	A group communication call is established between the at least two<br>
mobile units using the overlay communication cell. In one example, the group call is<br>
established by storing information at underlay cells identifying a control channel at<br>
the overlay cell for all of the participants of the call to use.<br>
[0017]	Preferably, the group call may be established by having the mobile<br>
units listen for a page. After detecting the page, the mobile units may respond to the<br>
page in various ways. For example, the mobile units may determine whether to return<br>
the page to the overlay cell and use the overlay cell to establish the group call. In<br>
another example, the mobile units may determine when to return the page to the<br>
underlay cell and not use the overlay cell to establish the group call. In still another<br>
example, the mobile units may determine not to return the page at all. In this case, the<br><br>
proper overlay cell is activated in the absence of receiving a page based upon<br>
information stored in the network.<br>
[0018]	Thus, a system and method are provided where group calls may be<br>
established and conducted in an efficient and convenient manner. A call manager is<br>
not needed in each cell to manage the group call for mobile units in that cell.<br>
Moreover, both group calls and point-to-point calls may established and conducted<br>
efficiently using the same infrastructure. In other words, the structure and manner<br>
that point-to-point communications are conducted are unchanged and unaffected.<br>
[0019]	Referring initially to FIG. 1, one example of a system used to a<br>
conduct group communication call using an overlay communications cell is described.<br>
An overlay communications cell 102 includes a group of underlay cells 104. A group<br>
of underlay cells include cells 106a, 106b, 106c, and 106d. It will be realized that<br>
each of the underlay cells 104 and 106a-106d contain the functionality of cellular<br>
systems, as is known in the art. For instance, these cells may include base stations,<br>
base station controllers, and other components as is known in the art. Furthermore,<br>
each of the cells may include one or more mobile units (not shown), which freely<br>
move amongst the various cells.<br>
[0020]	A cell 107 within the overlay communication cell 102 includes a<br>
pointerlOl. The pointer 101 points to a control channel 109 within the overlay<br>
communication cell 102. A group communication call may be established between<br>
mobile units residing in any of the underlay cells. An initiating mobile unit sends a<br>
message to a control unit at the overlay communication cell 102. The message<br>
includes a list of all the corresponding mobile units that are members of a talk group.<br>
The talk group represents the mobile users for which the group communication call is<br>
to be established. A controller at the overlay communication cell 102 instigates the<br>
sending of pages to find all of the talk group members. For instance, the controller<br>
may cause a page may be send in all the underlay cells that comprises the overlay<br>
communication cell 102. If a talk group member resides in an underlay cell, the talk<br>
group member uses the pointer in the underlay cell to connect to the control channel<br>
of the overlay communication cell 102.<br><br>
[0021]	In another example, a determination is made by the talk group member<br>
of whether to use the overlay cell for the group communication. A test is performed<br>
to determine if a corresponding overlay communication cell exists. Another test may<br>
be performed to determine the quality of service at the overlay cell. If either or both<br>
of these tests fail, the group communication may be conducted from the underlay cell<br>
instead of the overlay cell.<br>
[0022]	In still another example, the talk group member does not use the<br>
overlay communication cell 102 under any circumstances. This determination may be<br>
made because of the network loading conditions or other factors. In this case, there<br>
would be no need to maintain a pointer at the underlay cell that points to a control<br>
channel in the overlay cell.<br>
[0023]	Referring now to FIG. 2, an example of a system for facilitating group<br>
communications between mobile units is described. A mobile unit 201 within an<br>
underlay cell 204 transmits a communication to a base station controller 202. The<br>
base station controller 202 transmits the message via a selected one of broadcast<br>
control channels 206 to a base station controller 210 within an overlay cell 212.<br>
Underlay cells 220 and 222 also reside within the overlay communication cell 212.<br>
[0024]	Information on the underlay cell points the communication to a control<br>
channel 208a, 208n, through 208c on the overlay communication cell 212. For<br>
example, the base station controller 204 may store a pointer indicating the control<br>
channel 208a, 208b, and 208c. The mobile unit may be informed at call registration<br>
the pointer it will follow. Alternatively, all mobile units within a particular fleet may<br>
follow the same pointer to the same control channel on the overlay cell. Similarly,<br>
information on the underlay cells 220 and 220 may point to one of the control<br>
channels 208a-c.<br>
[0025]	A group communication call may be established between mobile units<br>
residing in the underlay cells 204, 220, and 222. In addition, other underlay cells may<br>
exist that are not included in the overlay communication cell 212. These underlay<br>
cells may have an associated overlay cell distinct and separate from the overlay<br>
communication cell 212 or may have no corresponding or associated overlay<br><br>
communication cell. In any of these cases, a group communication may be<br>
established between mobile units in any underlay cell.<br>
[0026]	An initiating mobile unit sends a message to a control unit at the<br>
overlay communication cell 212. The message includes a list of all the corresponding<br>
mobile units that are members of the talk group. For example, the mobile unit 201<br>
may send a message indicating members of a talk group to a controller associated<br>
with the overlay communication cell 212.<br>
[0027]	The controller at the overlay communication cell 212 instigates the<br>
sending of pages to find all of the talk group members. For instance, a page may be<br>
send in all the underlay cells 220 and 222. Also, pages may be produced for underlay<br>
cells outside of the overlay cell 212. If a talk group member resides within an<br>
underlay cell, the talk group member uses the pointer in the underlay cell to connect<br>
to the control channel of the overlay cell. For example, if a mobile unit in the talk<br>
group is present in the underlay cell 220, then the mobile unit may use a pointer in the<br>
underlay cell 220 to connect with the broadcast channel 206 and one of the control<br>
channels 208a-c.<br>
[0028]	The particular control channel 208a-c may be selected in any number<br>
of ways. For example, a particular fleet may have an assigned control channel. In<br>
another example, the channel may be selected randomly. Other selection mechanisms<br>
are also possible.<br>
[0029]	Alternatively, a determination may be made by the talk group member<br>
of whether to use the overlay cell for the group communication. In this case, a test is<br>
performed to determine if a corresponding overlay cell exists. Another test may be<br>
performed to determine the quality of service at the overlay cell. If either or both of<br>
these tests fail, the group communication may occur from the underlay cell instead of<br>
the overlay cell.<br>
[0030]	In still another example of the establishment of a group communication<br>
call, the talk group member may not use the overlay cell 212 under any<br>
circumstances. This determination may be made because of the network loading<br><br>
conditions or other factors. In this case, there would be no need to maintain a pointer<br>
at the underlay cell that points to a control channel in the overlay cell.<br>
[0031]	Referring now to FIGs. 3 a and 3b, one example of the establishment of<br>
a group communication call is described. In this example, the network comprises a<br>
first overlay cell 306, a second overlay cell 308, and a third overlay cell 310. The first<br>
overlay cell 306 includes first and second underlay cells 302 and 304. The second<br>
overlay cell 308 includes a third underlay cell 310, and the third overlay cell 310<br>
includes a fourth underlay cell 314. A group communication is initiated by a mobile<br>
in the first underlay cell 302 to include as a talk group itself and mobiles located in<br>
the second and third underlay cells 304 and 312.<br>
[0032]	At step 316, an initiating mobile device at the first underlay cell<br>
initiates a group communication call with members of the talk group. The message<br>
indicates the identities of the mobiles in the talk group that the initiating mobile<br>
device wishes to establish a group communication. These mobile units may be<br>
identified in any number of ways, for example, using a unique address or identifier to<br>
identify the members of the talk group.<br>
[0033]	At step 318, the message is received by a controller at a first overlay<br>
communication cell. For example, the message may be received by a network control<br>
device at the overlay communication cell. However, any other type of processing<br>
device may also receive and process the message.<br>
[0034]	At steps 320, 322, and 324, the controller at the first overlay<br>
communication cell initiates the sending of pages and pages are sent to the mobiles<br>
indicated in the message. The controller in the first overlay communication cell<br>
communicates with controllers in the second and third overlay cells so these<br>
controllers can page mobile units residing in the corresponding underlay cells. Then,<br>
a page is initiated within all underlay cells within the overlay cell to locate members<br>
of the talk group. Thus, a page is transmitted to any mobile within each of the first,<br>
second, third, and fourth underlay cells.<br><br>
[0035]	An overlay communication cell is activated and used by a mobile unit<br>
to conduct the group communication if any talk group member resides within a<br>
particular overlay communication cell. In this case, the first and second overlay<br>
communication, cells are activated at steps 326 and 328 by the mobiles in the second<br>
and third underlay cells returning a page to the appropriate overlay communication<br>
cell. The underlay cell may include a pointer in the overlay communication cell that<br>
points to a control channel in the appropriate overlay cell. The fourth underlay cell<br>
within the third overlay cell does not return a page because no mobile unit within the<br>
talk group is within the fourth underlay cell.<br>
[0036]	At step 330, a group call is established. This may be accomplished<br>
using the control channel that was specified in the pointer. The control channel may<br>
be different for each of the underlay cells. Alternatively, mobiles in the same fleet<br>
may use the same control channel.<br>
[0037]	At steps 332 and 334, the group call ends and the mobile units return to<br>
an appropriate underlay cell. This underlay cell may be the same or different than the<br>
underlay cell that the mobile unit was originally located. During the time of the group<br>
call, measurements are made to indicate the quality of service at the underlay cells.<br>
Based upon these measurements, the mobile unit is returned to the best overlay cell.<br>
[0038]	Referring now to FIGs. 4a and 4b, another example of the formation of<br>
a group communication call is described. In this example, the network comprises a<br>
first overlay cell 406, a second overlay cell 408, and a third overlay cell 410. The first<br>
overlay cell 406 includes first and second underlay cells 402 and 404. The second<br>
overlay cell 408 includes a third underlay cell 410, and the third overlay cell 410<br>
includes a fourth underlay cell 414. A fifth underlay cell 415 is not included within<br>
any overlay cell. A group communication is initiated by a mobile in the first underlay<br>
cell 402 to include as a talk group itself and mobiles located in the second and third<br>
underlay cells 404 and 415.<br>
[0039]	At step 416, an initiating mobile device at the first underlay cell<br>
initiates a group communication call with members of the talk group. The message<br>
indicates the identities of the mobiles in the talk group that the initiating mobile<br><br>
device wishes to establish a group communication. These mobile units may be<br>
identified in any number of ways, for example, using a unique address or identifier to<br>
identify the members of the talk group.<br>
[0040]	At step 418, the message is received by a controller at a first overlay<br>
communication cell. For example, the message may be received by a network control<br>
device at the overlay communication cell. However, any other type of processing<br>
device may also receive and process the message.<br>
[0041]	At steps 420,422, and 423, and 424, the controller at the first overlay<br>
communication cell initiates the sending of pages and pages are sent to the mobiles<br>
indicated in the message. The controller in the first overlay communication cell<br>
communicates with controllers in the second and third overlay cells so these<br>
controllers can page mobile units residing in the corresponding underlay cells. A<br>
page is initiated within all underlay cells within all overlay cells to locate members of<br>
the talk group and indicates the identity of the members of the talk group. In addition,<br>
a page request is made within the fifth underlay cell. Thus, a page is transmitted to<br>
any mobile within each of the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth underlay cells.<br>
[0042]	Since a mobile unit in the talk group is within the second underlay cell,<br>
at step 426, the mobile unit determines whether an overlay communication cell is<br>
present. For example, an indication may be stored at the underlay as to whether the<br>
underlay cell has a corresponding overlay communication cell. At step 428, the<br>
mobile unit determines whether the quality of service is acceptable at the overlay. If<br>
one or both of these conditions are met, then service continues as discussed above<br>
with respect to FIG. 3 where the appropriate overlay is activated at step 430. For<br>
instance, the mobile unit may use a pointer in the underlay cell to use a control<br>
channel at the overlay cell.<br>
[0043]	Since a mobile unit in the talk group is within the fifth underlay cell, at<br>
step 432, the mobile unit determines whether an overlay communication cell is<br>
present. For example, an indication may be stored at the underlay as to whether the<br>
underlay cell has a corresponding overlay communication cell. At step 434, the<br>
mobile unit determines whether the quality of service is acceptable at the overlay.<br><br>
However, since no overlay exists for the mobile in the fifth underlay cell, the mobile<br>
unit does not connect to the overlay and the mobile unit uses the underlay to engage<br>
the group call. The group call may be made using techniques that are known in the art<br>
to establish group calls amongst cells. In addition, if the service quality as determined<br>
at step 434 were unacceptable, the underlay cell would be used for the group<br>
conrmunication.<br>
[0044]	At step 436, the group communication call is established. For<br>
example, this may be accomplished by having a pointer in the underlay cell that<br>
points to a control channel in the appropriate overlay cell. For the situation where the<br>
overlay did not exist and/or the quality of the service at the overlay was unacceptable,<br>
the mobile uses the underlay cell to make the group communication rather than the<br>
overlay cell.<br>
[0045]	At steps 438, the mobile unit within the first overlay returns to the<br>
second underlay cell. However, the return may be to a different underlay cell than the<br>
underlay cell that the mobile unit was originally located. During the time of the group<br>
call, measurements are made to indicate the quality of service at the underlay cells.<br>
Based upon these measurements, the mobile unit is returned to the best overlay cell.<br>
[0046]	Referring now to FIGs. 3a and 5, another example of the establishment<br>
and execution of a group communication call is described. A group communication is<br>
initiated by a mobile in the first underlay cell 302 to include as a talk group itself and<br>
mobiles located in the second and third underlay cells 304 and 312.<br>
[0047]	At step 516, a initiating mobile device at the first underlay cell initiates<br>
a group communication call with members of the talk group. The message indicates<br>
the identities of the mobiles in the talk group that the initiating mobile device wishes<br>
to establish a group communication. These mobile units may be identified in any<br>
number of ways, for example, using a unique address or identifier to identify the<br>
members of the talk group.<br>
[0048]	At step 518, the message is received by a controller at a first overlay<br>
communication cell. For example, the message may be received by a network control<br><br>
device at the overlay communication cell. However, any other type of processing<br>
device may also receive and process the message.<br>
[0049]	At steps 520,522, and 524, the controller at the first overlay<br>
communication cell initiates the sending of pages and pages are sent to the mobiles<br>
indicated in the message. The controller in the first overlay communication cell<br>
communicates with controllers in the second and third overlay cells so these<br>
controllers can page mobile units residing in the corresponding underlay cells. Then,<br>
a message is sent by this controller to initiate a page to locate members of the talk<br>
group and indicates the identity of the members of the talk group. Thus, a page is<br>
transmitted to any mobile within each of the first, second, third, and fourth underlay<br>
cells.<br>
[0050]	At step 526, a group communication call is established. In this case,<br>
the controller at the overlay communication cell activates the overlay communication<br>
cell without receiving any response from the mobile units. For example, the<br>
controller at each of the overlay cells stores the control channel information, which it<br>
assigns to the appropriate mobile units.<br>
[0051]	At steps 528 and 530, the mobile units return to an underlay cell. This<br>
underlay cell may be the same or different than the underlay cell that the mobile unit<br>
was originally located. During the time of the group call, measurements are made to<br>
indicate the quality of service at the underlay cells. Based upon these measurements,<br>
the mobile unit is returned to the best overlay cell.<br>
[0052]	While there have been illustrated and described particular<br>
embodiments of the present invention, it will be appreciated that numerous changes<br>
and modifications will occur to those skilled in the art, and it is intended in the<br>
