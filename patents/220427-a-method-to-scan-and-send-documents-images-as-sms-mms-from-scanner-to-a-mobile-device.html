FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention in general applies to scanners and mobile communication technologies. This invention further relates to scanning of documents and forwarding them to mobile communication devices. More particularly, this invention relates to a method to scan and send the documents/images as SMS/MMS to a mobile communication device.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
In the existing technologies:<br>
A scanner is used in day to day activities to scan the documents and to obtain hard copies of the document or to store the scanned document as an image in computers.<br>
The FAX technology is used to send the documents to other users with capabilities to receive the FAX.<br>
Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) is a feature in mobile communication with the option to send messages comprising a combination of text, sounds, images and video to MMS capable handsets. This feature allows users to send images as MMS to the other mobile users. Nowadays MMS handsets have become the de facto standard and most new mobile phones come with inbuilt MMS feature. Using the MMS technology, users can share text, pictures and movies with other users of mobile networks.<br>
The Short Message Service (SMS) is a feature in mobile communication for sending and receiving text messages to and from mobile devices. The text can comprise of words or numbers or an alphanumeric combination. This allows two mobile users to communicate with each other using the SMS technology.<br><br>
Mobile devices logged on to one network are capable of sending MMS as well as SMS to mobile devices logged on to other mobile networks using the network service providers' features.<br>
There also exists another feature whereby a PC can be used to compose SMS/MMS messages and send it to mobile phones of any mobile network. In this case the PC composes SMS/MMS messages and sends it to the recipient address using WAP push or HTTP push function to the MMSC/SMSC which in turn informs the intended recipient and sends the message to the user.<br>
Generally, a scanner is used to scan a document in order to generate hard copies of the original or to create an image which is stored by the host on the host file system.<br>
In the case of sending an SMS/MMS message, the user first creates the message on the mobile device and then selects the send option on which the user is prompted to enter the recipient number. When the number is entered the user clicks OK and the message is sent to the recipient.<br>
LIMITATIONS<br>
While the above referenced procedures accomplish their respective tasks, they require certain steps to be followed in case a scanner can be used to create and send the SMS/MMS messages to the mobile devices. As understood from the prior art the available related art features allow use of mobile and PC to create and send the SMS/MMS messages to the users of mobile network. The major draw back of this method is that the scanner cannot compose and send the message.<br>
Therefore in light of the foregoing deficiencies in the prior art, the applicant's invention is herein presented. Based upon the foregoing, it is necessary to provide a method which allows the scanner to compose and send the SMS/MMS<br><br>
message to the mobile device. Accordingly the applicant hereby proposes to circumvent the above discussed problem by incorporating a system and method to make the scanner compatible with the mobile technology.<br>

The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. The following description and drawings are illustrative of the invention and are not to be construed as limiting the innovation. Numerous specific details are described to provide a through understanding of the present invention. However in certain instances well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure<br><br>
the present invention in detail.<br>
Before describing the various aspects and details of the present invention it will be useful to describe the context in which the invention is used. Consequently, a preliminary discussion that refers to Figures 1 and Figure 2 is hereby provided. Figure 1 illustrates the scanning of document and different uses of the document. Further Figure 2 illustrates sending an MMS/SMS using the mobile phones.<br>
The scanner would be used to scan the documents/image to be sent to the mobile user. Depending on the type of document i.e. whether the document is a text document or an image the scanner will create a long SMS containing the scanned text or an MMS message with the scanned data.<br>
In case of a text document the scanner will use Optical Character Recognition to get the text contents from the document. Then a SMS message containing the captured text as message data will be created using the standard SMS message format. There are two ways of sending and receiving SMS messages; by text mode and by PDU (protocol description unit) mode.<br>
In case of an image document the scanner will scan the document as in one of the format used in MMS messages like JPEG, GIF and some other formats supported under MMS messages. It will then form an MMS message using the specifications for MMS messages.<br>
This SMS/ MMS can be sent to the recipient using any one of the following methods.<br>
1.	Using a GSM module;<br>
2.	Using an MMSC or an SMSC;<br>
3.	Using a Bluetooth enabled mobile.<br>
All the components used in this invention like scanner, SMSC, MMSC, Bluetooth<br><br>
phone, GSM are in existence and only need to be interface to one other.<br>
To send the document/image to the mobile network the user needs to:<br>
1.	scan the document<br>
2.	select the option of sending the document to a mobile user<br>
3.	Indicate the type of document type (image/text)<br>
4.	Enter the recipient details and send<br>
The scanner depending on the available interface to the mobile service provider will send the text message/ MMS message to the destination address.<br>
The particular aspect of the invention now described herein with reference to drawings. Figure 1 shows the scanning of document and manner of storage and use of the image of the document that is scanned. Here, the document image can be printed as hard copy or a soft copy of the document can be stored in the computer which can be further used to compose an SMS/MMS.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates a method of sending an SMS/MMS using a mobile phone. Here the user composes a SMS/MMS which is going to be send. Then the user activates the send option in his mobile. Subsequently the recipient information is typed in by the user and the send process is completed by clicking the required button in the mobile. The recipient subsequently receives the message.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates the various interfaces available for scanner to communicate with mobile networks. This can be done through GSM, SMSC/MMSC or BT.<br>
Figures 4a and 4b illustrate the flow of operations in sending a scanned document to the recipient. This constitutes of the following steps:<br>
1.	First, the user scans a document and clicks the send to mobile option which is built in the scanner.<br>
2.	Then the user enters recipient details and document type.<br><br>
3.	The system then checks the scanned data type and creates message in required format.<br>
4.	Finally system checks the available interface with mobile Network.<br>
5.	The available interface of GSM or MMSC/SMSC or BT is checked and the message is sent using the corresponding interface.<br>
6.	The status of the message send is also indicated to the user.<br>
The scanner would be used to scan the documents/image to be sent to the mobile user. Depending on the type of document i.e. whether the document is a text document or an image the scanner will create a long SMS containing the scanned text or an MMS message with the scanned data.<br>
Using the scanned data and the type of message to be sent the scanner would create a message payload according to the appropriate messaging standard viz. SMS or MMS.<br>
This SMS/ MMS can be sent to the recipient using any one of the following methods:<br>
Using a GSM module<br>
In this embodiment of the present invention, the scanner is interfaced to a GSM module which contains a SMS/MMS service enabled SIM card. When a document is ready to be sent to a mobile phone, the user will be prompted for the destination address. After the destination address is fed to the scanner, the scanner will create an SMS/MMS message for the scanned document as required by the GSM module and send it using the GSM module.<br>
The MFP will be interfaced to a GSM module. This module will consist of GSM engine and the minimum necessary h/w for the unit to be operated like a mobile phone. This GSM module will be connected to the MFP using the connectivity interface provided by the module like serial, USB etc. Making use of this interface<br><br>
the MFP can send AT commands to the GSM module to use the module. The GSM AT command contains commands which will allow the MFP to send messages to the mobile user.<br>
Using an MMSC or an SMSC<br>
In this embodiment of the present invention, the scanner is connected to a Local Area Network or to the Internet to which the MMSC or SMSC is also connected. When a document is to be sent to a mobile phone, the user will be prompted for the destination address by the scanner. After the destination address is fed to the scanner, the scanner creates an SMS/MMS message and sends it to the SMSC/MMSC on the network (LAN/Internet), which will then send the message to the desired recipient-Using a Blue tooth enabled mobile<br>
In this embodiment of the present invention, the scanner creates an MMS / SMS message based on the user request for the scanned document to be sent as MMS / SMS, Also, the scanner obtains the destination address i.e. the address of the recipient from the user. Then the scanner sends the composed MMS / SMS along with the recipient address to the Bluetooth mobile to which the scanner is connected using the imaging profile. The said mobile, in turn, forwards this message to the final recipient.<br>
All the components used in this invention such as scanner, SMSC, MMSC Bluetooth phone, GSM are in existence and only need to be interfaced to one other.<br>
To send the document/image to the mobile network, the user needs to:<br>
1.	scan the document<br>
2.	select the option of sending the document to a mobile user<br>
3.	Indicate the type of document type (image/text)<br><br>
4.  Enter the recipient details and give the send command<br>
The scanner depending on the available interface to the mobile service provider will send the text message/ MMS message to the destination address.<br>
