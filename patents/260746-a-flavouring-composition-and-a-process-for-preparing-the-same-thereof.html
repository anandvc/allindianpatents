				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention concerns taste improvement in foodstuffs, beverages, pharmaceutics, tobacco products and oral care products. More particularly, the; present invention provides flavour compositions that can be used to confer a fuller and richer teste to foodstuffs, beverages, pharmaceutics, tobacco products and oral care products. The flavour compositions according to the invention are characterised by the presence of one lor more substances that are capable of modulating and complementing the impact of othef flavour imparting substances.<br>
The present invention also encompasses the use of the aforementioned taste improving substances for improving the taste of foodstuffs, beverages, pharmaceutics, tobacco products and oral care products, as well as to foodstuffs, beverages, pharmaceutics, tobacco products and oral care products containing these substances.<br>
BackgroMd of the iBveÂ»tiott<br>
"Umami" is a term commonly used to describe the taste impact of L-glutaniate salts and certain nucleotides. Umami is the main taste in the Japanese stock called "dash?1, and in bouillon and other stocks. Glutamic acid is an important constituent of food proteins (plant and animal) such as those abundantly found in foods such as meat, poultry, seafood and vegetables. Two nucleotides that contribute most to the umami taste, GMP (guanosine monophosphate) and IMP (inosine monophosphate) are also present in many foods. By themselves these nucleotides do not typically give as powerful a flavour result as MSG (monosodium glutamate). However, due to a synergistic interaction with MSG, a pronounced enhancing effect can be observed if these nucleotides are used in combination with MSG.<br>
The umami taste has characteristic qualities that differentiate it from other tastes. It has been convincingly shown that umami represents the fifth taste, in addition to the other four basic tastes sweet, acid, salt and bitter. The most common descriptors that are used to describe the umami taste include "savoury", "meaty" and "broth-like". "Umami" is literally translated as "delicious".<br><br>
There is a need for taste modulating systems that do not impart or enhance the typical savoury flavour notes in the way MSG does.<br>
As alternatives to MSG and S'-nucleotides, other molecules have been proposed as (umami-like) taste modulating substances:<br>
Organic acids like tartaric and succinic acid have been reported to exhibit taste enhancing properties (Ney [1971] Z. Lebensm. Unters. Forsch. 146: 141; Velisek et aj. [1978] Nahrung 22: 735). Taste modulating properties have also been attributed to certain di* to octa-peptides (Yamasaki and Maekawa [1978] Agric. Biol. Chem. 42: 1761; Noguchi et a], [1975] J. Agric. Food Chem. 23: 49).<br>
WO 97/04667 discloses tripeptides containing a hydrophobic amino acid residue and at least one acidic amino acid residue as well as N-lactoyl-X substances, wherein X represents an amino acid residue, as flavouring ingredients to impart savoury taste and increase the mouthfeel of foodstuffs. It is also disclosed that these peptides and derivatives can partly mimic organoleptic features of MSG<br>
EP-A 1 252 825 discloses flavouring compositions for imparting umami taste to food products comprising substances that are finned by the reaction of tne primary or secondary amino group of an amino acid, peptide or protein with the carbonyl group of a reducing sugar. According to this document the most preferred substances are those wherein the amino acid residue is selected from glutamic acid or aspartic acid and the sugar residue is selected from fructose, glucose, maltose, lactose, galactose, rhamnose, xylose and mannose.<br>
EP-A 1 356 744 discloses flavouring compositions containing N-acetylglycine and the use thereof for imparting umami taste to foodstuffs.<br>
As described above umami taste and umami imparting substances contribute to the flavour of foodstuffs, especially in the savoury range.<br>
In sweet and beverage products, further examples of the importance of the gustative dimension of flavourings have been reported. These examples include taste attributes such as bitterness, tingling and cooling-freshness.<br>
Bitterness is an essential aspect of some food flavours, among which chocolate taste. Purine alkaloids, like theobromine and caffeine, as well as amino acids and peptides have been known for a long time as bitter compounds. In British patent no. GB 1420909 it is disclosed that the bitter flavour of cocoa can be reproduced using a combination of a purina alkaloid and an amino acid or an oligopeptide which 'produces a surpringly moire natural<br><br>
simultaneously bitter and astringent flavour note than either of these types of substances<br>
alone*.<br>
Menthol, an important constituent of peppermint oil, has a strong impact on flavoured products not only because of its mint smell but also because it imparts a cooling and fresh taste. Next to mint flavoured products, it has been suggested to employ menthol in ofhet types of flavour to impart a cool taste. US patent application no. US2005013846 for example discloses how menthol and derivatives thereof can be used as flavouring in water continuous spreadable acidified food products to obtain table spreads exhibiting a fresh, cool taste impression.<br>
Similarly, cinnamic aldehyde and eugenol, constituents of cinnamon oil, aife used in flavouring composition for confectionary products, not only for their smell but also because they impart a warm and tingling taste. The oral pungency of cinnamic aldehyde was described as burning and tingling by Cliff M and Heymann H [ Journal of Sensory Studies 7 (1992)279-290]. According to the same authors eugenol exhibits a long-lasting nuaofaa^ effect Cinnamon oil has been proposed as a taste improving flavouring. International patent application no. WO9006689 discloses that cinnamon oil, among other spice extracts, added to a minty flavour formulation, can be used to improve Ihe kng-lastiBg flavour of chewmg-guflau<br>
Document no. EP1473287 discloses a range of alcjfidknanudes which can fee used within flavouring composition to augment or impart flavour character such as fruity, umami taste, long-lasting taste, pungency, tingling, bitterness, fatty mouthfeel, freshness. Tingling effect was, among other applications, demonstrated on chewing gum prepared using N isobutyl E2, Z6-nonadienamide.<br>
Although a lot of work has been focused on finding taste improving substances that are capable of imparting new exciting taste attributes, there still is a need for new taste improving substances, and in particular for taste improving substances with taste modulating properties that are suitable for use in both savoury and non-savoury applications.<br>
The flavour composition of instant inventions comprising a compound of formula (I) and/or edible salts thereof are advantageously applied in flavour compositions, foodstuffs, beverages, pharmaceutics, tobacco products and is a synergistic composition and exhibits surprising results.<br><br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The present inventors have surprisingly found that substances represented by the following formulae (I) and (II) can be used advantageously to improve the taste of foodstuffs, beverages, pharmaceutics., tobacco products and oral care products: R'-CR7(OR4)-CO-NR2-CR8R3-X-OR5    (I)<br>
R6-CR7(OR4)-CO-Az	(II)<br>
The present inventors found that the taste improving substances according to the present invention are particularly useful in a wide variety of applications including savoury food, non-savoury food, such as dairy, beverages and confectionery, as well as pharmaceutics, tobacco products and oral care products.<br>
Therefore, the present invention relates to flavour compositions^ foodstuffs, beverages, pharmaceutics, tobacco products and oral cane products, comprising at least one substance according to formula (I) and/or at least one substance according to formula (II).<br>
WO 92/06601 discloses certain amide based, non-caloric sugar substitutes derived from sugar carboxyh'c acids and ammo alcohols, which possess similar physical rheologjcal and colligative properties to sucrose. These substances may be used as sugar substitutes for formulated foods such as confectioneries, beverages, bakery products and the like, in order to simulate the structure, texture, freezing point depression, moisture retention, density^ water solubility, solution viscosity properties, stability, non-reactivity and appearance characteristics of sucrose. Optionally these sugar substitutes may be used in combination with a high potency (artificial) sweetener, typical proportions thereof ranging from about 0.2 to 2.0 parts of sweetener per 100 parts of the sugar substitute. WO 92/06601 discloses a foodstuff (yellow cake) comprising 28.3 wt% of the sugar substitute.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention relates to the use of the substances according to formula (I) or formula (II) for improving the taste of foodstuffs, beverages, pharmaceutics, tobacco products and oral care products, and to a process for improving the taste of the latter products.<br>
The taste improving substances according to the present invention can be applied advantageously to impart desirable taste attributes to the aforementioned products. In addition, the present taste improving substances are capable of modulating the taste impact of<br><br>
other flavour ingredients contained within these same products, thereby improving the overall flavour quality of these products.<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
Accordingly, the present invention in a first aspect relates to the use for improving the taste of foodstuffs, beverages, pharmaceutics, tobacco products or oral care products of a substance according to formula (I) or formula (II), or edible salts thereof:<br>
R!-CR7(OR4)-CO-NR2-CR8R3-X-OR5	(I)<br>
R6-CR7(OR4)-CO-Az	(II)<br>
wherein:<br>
X represents a covalent bond; Ci-C5 aBtyl or Cj-Cs alkenyl, each optionally substituted with 1 -4 substituents selected from hydroxyl, Ci-Ca alky! and Ct-Cs alkenyl; R! and R7 independently represent hydrogen; or Ci-C8 alkyl, C2-Cg alkenyl or CyCg cycloalkyl, each optionally substituted with 1-8 substituents selected from hydroxyl, oxo, Ci-C3 alkyl; C2-C3 alkenyl and CrC3 carboxyl;<br>

R3 and R8 independently represent hydrogen; hydroxyl; or CrC8 alkyl, C2-Cg alkenyl, or C3-Cg cycloalkyl, each optionally substituted with 1-8 substituents selected from hydroxyl, Ci-Cs alkyl and C2-C3 alkenyl;<br>
R4 represents hydrogen, Ci-C3 acyl or Ci-Ca alkyl;<br>
R5 represents hydrogen, CrC3 acyl, Ci-Cs alkyl, a phosphate group selected from mono-, di-and triphosphate or a C2-C5 carboxyacyl, optionally further substituted with 1-3 substituents selected from hydroxyl, oxo, Ci-C3 carboxyl;<br>
R6 represents C2-C6 alkyl or C4-C6 cycloalkyl, each optionally substituted with 1-6 hydroxyl groups and each optionally substituted with 1-4 substituents selected from Ci-Cs alkyl and C{-C3 carboxyl; and<br><br>
Az represents an amino acid residue, and the CO-Az bond represents an amide bond;<br>
provided that R'-CR7(OR4)-CO- does not represent a hexose or heptose sugar acid residue comprising more than 4 hydroxyl groups.<br>
More preferably, in said formulas X represents Ci-C5 alkyl, C2-Cs alkeniyl, each optionally substituted with 1-4 hydroxyl groups; R1 and R7 independently represent hydrogen; or Ci-C5 alkyl or C2-C5 alkenyl, each substituted with 1-5 substituents selected from hydroxyl, oxo and CrC3 carboxyl; R2 represents hydrogen; or Ci-Cs alkyl, Ca-Ce alkenyl or CrQ acyl, each substituted with 1-6 hydroxyl groups; R3 and R8 independently represent hydrogen, hydroxyl or CrC8 alkyl or Ci-C8 alkenyl, each substituted with 1-8 hydroxyl groups; R4 represents hydrogen; R5 represents hydrogen, a phosphate group selected from mono-, di-, and triphosphate or a C2-Cs carboxyacyl, optionally further substituted with 1-3 substituents selected from hydroxyl, oxo, C\-C^ carboxyl; R6 represents Ca-Cs alkyl substituted with 1-5 substituents selected from hydroxyl and Ci-C3 carboxyl; and AZ represents a proteogenic aminoacid;.<br>
The present inventors have found that the substances defined here above are very useful ingredients which, particularly in the presence of other flavouring substances, are capable of imparting highly appreciated taste sensations to the products in which they are incorporated, specifically "roundness", "fullness", "substance", "transparency", "continuity", "tingling", "numbing", "bitter" and/or "metallic". Because of this, the present taste improving substances can be employed to improve the taste (including "mouthfeel") of foodstuffs, beverages, pharmaceutics, tobacco products and oral care products.<br>
The taste improving substances of the present invention as such are capable of imparting highly desirable taste attributes. In addition, it has been found that the taste modulating substances according to the invention are capable of complementing and modulating the sensory impact of other flavouring substances contained in the aforementioned products, including complementing and modulating 'salty taste impact', 'acidic taste impact' and/or 'bitterness'.<br>
Throughout this document the terms "taste" and "flavour" are used interchangeably to describe the sensory impact that is perceived via the mouth, especially the tongue, and the olfactory epithelium in the nasal cavity. The term "taste modulating" as used herein refers to the capability of a composition or substance to alter the taste impact of other, flavour imparting, substances present within the same product, with the proviso that this change in taste impact is not caused by the flavour contribution of said composition or substance per se,<br><br>
but instead that it mainly results from the combined effect of on the one hand the taste modulating composition or substance and on the other hand the other flavour imparting substances. The present substances combine the capability of modulating the taste of other flavour substances with a taste contribution of their own. The favourable impact of the present taste improving substances is believed to be the result of the combination of these two effects.<br>
Because the taste improving substances according to the invention are not particularly volatile, they do not produce a strong aroina impact, even though they can affect the aroma impact of other flavour substances. Here the term "aroma" refers to the aspect of taste that is perceived through the olfactory epithelium. Because of the low volatility of the present taste improving substances it is believed that the advantageous properties of these substances are somehow associated with the impact that these substances have on the sensory receptors located within the mouth.<br>
It was found that particularly satisfying results can be obtained with taste improving substances according to formula (I) and/or formula (O) wherein X represents a Q-C-4 alky! or â¬2-04 alkenyl chain, each optionally substituted with 1-2 substituents selected from hydroxyl and Ci-Cz alkvl.
