				<td>Security element<br>
This invention relates to a security element, in particular for bank notes, having a<br>
carrier material and a magnetic code and/or a code independent thereof based on elec-<br>
troconductivity, hereinafter referred to as a conductivity code, and in addition an opti-<br>
cal code. The invention further relates to a security document, in particular a bank<br>
note, having such a security element. The security element is in particular a security<br>
thread. Security threads are used as a security feature in a great variety of products, in<br>
particular security papers. One of the best known applications, which must meet ex-<br>
tremely high security requirements, is the embedding of the security thread in bank<br>
note paper, the optical code in most cases forming positive or negative writing to be<br>
checked with the naked eye in transmitted light. The optical code can instead or addi-<br>
tionally be a code to be checked by optical devices, in particular a bar code (WO<br>
99/28852).<br>
To impede imitation of the security thread, the thread is usually equipped with<br>
further security features in addition to the optical code, in particular an electroconduc-<br>
tive coating and/or a coating with magnetic properties, said coatings being disposed<br>
one above the other. Such security features are tested by machine and therefore also<br>
referred to as "machine features." The optical code is usually formed by the machine<br>
features themselves by the associated coatings forming either positive writing or,<br>
through corresponding gaps in the coatings, negative writing. A customary way of<br>
producing the optical code is to partially demetalize a metalized thread, whereby the<br>
layer with magnetic properties thereabove is either removed at the same time (EP 0<br>
748 896 A1), or disposed so as not to interfere with the demetalizing zones or applied<br>
so thin that the demetalized areas of the security thread are visually recognizable in<br>
transmitted light despite the magnetic layer present (EP 0 498 186 A1).<br>
Instead of producing the electroconductive layer by vacuum metalization of the<br>
security thread, the electroconductive coating can also be applied as metal-pigmented<br>
printing ink, e.g. silver bronze (EP 0 516 790 B1, Figure 8). Alternatively, the mag-<br>
netic layer can additionally be made electroconductive by admixture of carbon black<br>
particles, so that all three security features - magnetic, electroconductive, negative<br>
writing - are produced simultaneously by printing a single layer.<br>
In addition, it is known to apply the layer with magnetic properties in such a way<br>
that it forms a special code (EP 0 914 970 A2). Said magnetic code can consist of<br>
magnetic material or material that is detectable by magnetoresistors (EP 0 610 917<br>
A1), the code being detectable not only due to the local distribution of material but<br>
also due to different magnetoresistive properties (EP 0610917Al)or different mag-<br>
netic layer thicknesses (EP 0 914 970 A2) or different magnetic properties such as re-<br>
manence properties or coercivity (WO 99/28852).<br>
From WO 99/28852 it is in addition known not only to apply the magnetic coat-<br>
ing in the form of a special code but also to produce a special conductivity code by<br>
applying the electroconductive metal layer in certain portions.<br>
If the optical code does not need to be visible in transmitted light, the magnetic<br>
coating can have, instead of gaps in the form of negative writing for example, a corre-<br>
sponding inscription printed on the magnetic layer with conventional ink (EP 0 610<br>
917 A1,EP 0 748 896 A1).<br>
A general concern with security threads is that potential forgers should not be-<br>
come aware of the presence of the machine features. This cannot be readily avoided,<br>
however, since a magnetic coating usually has a totally different appearance from an<br>
electroconductive metal coating with metallic luster.<br>
WO 99/28852 therefore proposes disposing the magnetic layer and the electro-<br>
conductive metal layer in exact register one above the other so that they completely<br>
conceal each other. This measure is only successful when the security thread is viewed<br>
only from one side or at least has an opaque base material. With security threads in<br>
bank notes whose optical code is tested in transmitted light, however, the security<br>
thread is usually transparent so that a different appearance would result depending on<br>
the viewing side. For this case of a security thread visible on both sides, EP 0 516 790<br>
B1 and EP 0 748 896 A1 propose covering the magnetic coating with the electrocon-<br>
ductive material completely on both sides so that a uniform appearance results<br>
in the paper in reflected and transmitted light.<br>
A different manner of concealment is adopted by EP 0 914 970 A2, which<br>
proposes "masking" a magnetic bar code by providing masking bars of the same<br>
magnetic material in the areas between the magnetic bars, the masking bars<br>
differing from the bars forming the magnetic code only in the thickness of the<br>
material, and thus in the intensity of the magnetic feature. A potential forger is<br>
thus optically deceived since he will at first assume that the masking bars are<br>
part of the magnetic code. However, the production quality of the security thread<br>
and the measuring device quality for testing the security thread must meet all<br>
high requirements for the masking bars to be reliably recognized as such and not<br>
attributed to the magnetic code.<br>
The problem of the present invention is to provide a security element, in<br>
particular for bank notes, that does not readily show all its security features and<br>
can be produced with little effort and reliably tested.<br>
This problem is solved according to the invention by a security element<br>
comprising a carrier material equipped with a first coating of magnetic material<br>
forming a first code and a second coating of electroconductive material forming a<br>
second code and having in addition a third, optically readable code formed at<br>
least in certain areas by a third coating of non-magnetic, nonelectroconductive<br>
material and covering at least partial areas of the security element not covered<br>
by the first coating and/or the second coating, said three coatings not being<br>
distinguishable from each other with the naked eye.<br>
The carrier material may consist of transparent plastic. The nonmagnetic,<br>
nonelectroconductive coating preferably partly or completely overlaps the coating<br>
of the first code and/or the coating of the second code.<br>
In one embodiment, the nonmagnetic, nonelectroconductive coating<br>
adjoins the coating of the first code and/or the coating of the second code. In<br>
another embodiment, the three coatings do not overlap.<br>
The security element is preferably in the form of a thread or strip, wherein<br>
each longitudinal portion of the thread or strip may be provided with at least one<br>
of said three coatings.<br>
The optically readable code preferably comprises negative or positive<br>
writing, which may be present only in areas of the security element that are not<br>
covered either by the first, magnetic coating or by the second, electroconductive<br>
coating.<br>
At least one of the three coatings is preferably present on both sides of<br>
the security element. The coating of the first code may comprise magnetic<br>
materials that differ in their magnetic remanence and/or coercive field strength.<br>
The security element may have a thermochromic security feature, and it<br>
may have a luminescent security feature. The materials of said three coatings<br>
are preferably printing inks, and the printing inks may be opaque.<br>
The electroconductive material may comprise carbon black incorporated<br>
in binder, and the magnetic material may comprise magnetic pigments<br>
incorporated in binder. The magnetic material preferably comprises a soft-<br>
magnetic powder ink.<br>
This invention also relates to a security document, such as a bank note,<br>
comprising at least one said security element.<br>
The inventive concealment of the security features of the security element<br>
is based on, among other things, applying different security features to a carrier<br>
material and forming said different security features of materials that are not<br>
distinguishable from each other optically, that is, with the naked eye. The carrier<br>
material can be an opaque or transparent material, preferably plastic, especially<br>
preferably transparent plastic.<br>
Specifically, the inventive concealment is based on providing in addition to<br>
the technically testable security features ("machine features"), that is, in addition<br>
to the coating with the electroconductive material and/or the, coating with the<br>
magnetic material, a further coating that does not have the characteristic<br>
physical properties of the machine features, i.e. is not electroconductive or does<br>
not have the special magnetic properties.<br>
Said further coating of "neutral" material covers at least also areas of the security<br>
element that are not covered by the machine features. Since the viewer cannot distin-<br>
guish between the individual materials he is faced with a visually recognizable pattern,<br>
for example a bar code or combination of characters (hereinafter "optical code"), that<br>
is formed by joint viewing of the areas covered by machine features and the areas cov-<br>
ered by neutral material. The viewer cannot see whether or where in the optical code<br>
machine features might be located.<br>
The machine feature areas and the areas of the security element covered with<br>
neutral material can be present separately from each other in the simplest case. How-<br>
ever, more effective concealment results if the areas are adjacent or preferably overlap<br>
each other partly or optionally completely. An especially preferred embodiment pro-<br>
vides that the security element is a security thread and that each longitudinal portion of<br>
the thread is provided with at least one of the coding materials so that the thread is<br>
coated over its total length with material looking the same. Said continuous coating<br>
preferably has gaps in the form of a negative writing as the optical code. In this case<br>
the viewer will at first think he is faced with a conventional, all-over coated security<br>
thread having the typical gaps in the form of negative writing. Production of the inven-<br>
tive security element is especially simple if the different coating materials are based on<br>
printing inks that look the same and are admixed with particles having the machine-<br>
testable features. The uncoated areas of the security element associated with the opti-<br>
cal code then do not need to be produced by an elaborate demetalizing method, but can<br>
simply remain unprinted. The invention is therefore especially suitable for a transpar-<br>
ent security thread that is visible in transmitted light when embedded in the paper. For<br>
the purposes of increasing the contrast in transmitted light, the machine-testable coat-<br>
ing materials and the neutral material are opaque, preferably dark, and preferably<br>
based on the same printing ink.<br>
Additionally, further security features can be integrated into the security element,<br>
in particular a thermochromic and/or luminescent security feature.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the security element is a security thread,<br>
i.e. the security element has the form of a thread or strip that is embedded at least<br>
partly into a document material, such as bank note paper, or can be disposed on the<br>
surface. The following examples will therefore be described with reference to this pre-<br>
ferred form. However, it is likewise possible within the scope of the invention to give<br>
the security element any other desired outline form.<br>
In the following the invention will be described by way of example with refer-<br>
ence to the accompanying figures. The proportions shown in the figures do not neces-<br>
sarily correspond to the relations existing in reality and serve primarily to improve<br>
clarity.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a security element with a continuous electroconductive coating with<br>
a magnetic code printed thereover and an optical code in the electroconductive coat-<br>
ing;<br>
Fig. 2 shows a security element with a magnetic coating with a conductivity code<br>
printed thereover and an optical code in the conductivity code and the magnetic coat-<br>
ing;<br>
Fig. 3 shows a security element with spaced apart magnetic code, conductivity<br>
code and optical code;<br>
Fig. 4 shows a security element with a conductivity code partly superimposed by<br>
a magnetic code and forming an optical code therewith and with a third coating;<br>
Fig. 5 shows a security element with a magnetic code superimposed on an optical<br>
code of electroconductive and neutral coating portions; and<br>
Fig. 6 shows a continuously coated security element with a conductivity code,<br>
thereover a magnetic code and a neutral coating between the two codes, and an optical<br>
code in the form of negative writing in the continuous coating.<br>
Figures 1 to 6 each show the security element in a top view and, thereunder,<br>
schematically in a side view. The plan view shows the appearance of the security ele-<br>
ment the way it presents itself to the viewer in a top view with use of a white or light<br>
security element or in transmitted light with use of a transparent security element. The<br>
side view shows the particular layer structure of the security element. If it is a security<br>
thread, the width is usually in the range of 1 to 2 millimeters. All figures show only a<br>
short portion of the security thread, which is usually produced as an endless thread.<br>
In the figures the same layer materials are consistently designated with uniform<br>
reference numbers.<br>
Figure 1 shows continuously conductive, magnetically coded negative text ele-<br>
ment 1. That is, optical code 20 is formed by gaps forming characters in continuous,<br>
electroconductive coating 30 of security element 1. Security element 1 consists of<br>
transparent plastic 10 so that optical code 20 is visible in transmitted light if security<br>
element 1 is embedded for example in bank note paper or another security document.<br>
Continuous coating 30 is printed with special magnetic code 40 that is not distin-<br>
guishable in its optical appearance from coating 30 thereunder to the naked eye. Mag-<br>
netic code 40 forms a bar code for example. In the simplest case the code can be a con-<br>
tinuous coating, like continuous electroconductive coating 30 in the embodiment.<br>
In this way the impartial viewer is not aware that the security element has not<br>
only optical codes 20 but also magnetic code 40. "Magnetic code" refers according to<br>
the present invention to any "magnetic coating" provided due to its special magnetic<br>
material properties for testing the authenticity of the security element by said magnetic<br>
properties. Such coatings may also be for example coatings of a material that is identi-<br>
fiable by magnetoresistors and thus reliably distinguishable from other materials of the<br>
security element.<br>
The security element according to Figure 1 has altogether three security features,<br>
namely optical code 20, magnetic code 40 and continuous electroconductivity 30. It is<br>
thus "triple coded." The inventive purpose is also attained, however, if coating 30 does<br>
not have any special physical properties and is for example a neutral printing ink. The<br>
most essential condition to be met by coating 30 is that it is optically indistinguishable<br>
from the material of magnetic ink 40.<br>
Figure 2 shows similar security element 1 to Figure 1 having a transparent plastic<br>
as carrier material 10 but being coated continuously with magnetic ink 40 which is<br>
coated with a special code of electroconductive ink 30. Instead of a special magnetic<br>
code this security element thus has special conductivity code 30, and instead of con-<br>
tinuous electroconductivity this security element is continuously magnetic. In contrast<br>
to the security element shown in Figure 1, optical code 20 is present not only in con-<br>
tinuous magnetic coating 40 of security element 1 but also in areas of electroconduc-<br>
tive coating 30. Since optical code 20 is negative writing, both magnetic layer 40 and<br>
electroconductive layer 30 have accordingly formed gaps in the areas of optical code<br>
20. Continuous magnetic coating 40 could be replaced by a neutral printing ink in this<br>
embodiment, too, but this would reduce the number of security features of the security<br>
element from three to two.<br>
Due to the elevated security and the special deception of the viewer and potential<br>
forger, the preferred embodiments of the invention provide three security features, an<br>
optical, a magnetic and an electroconductive security feature, said security features<br>
being produced using coating materials that are optically indistinguishable and applied<br>
to security element 1 in the form of printing inks by a suitable method, preferably<br>
printing technology. The printing technologies are for example screen printing, gra-<br>
vure, offset and flexography, whereby screen printing and gravure are preferred. The<br>
security features can of course also be applied by any other suitable method, such as<br>
spraying or vapor deposition technologies. If vapor deposition technologies are used,<br>
vacuum coating methods are preferred.<br>
Figure 3 shows a further embodiment of inventive security element 1. In this<br>
case, optical code 20 consists of characters 20a and 20d and trapezoidal bars 20b, 20c.<br>
Individual components 20a to 20d of optical code 20 are each formed of a certain coat-<br>
ing material on security element 1. Component 20a "G&amp;D" is formed by coating 50 of<br>
neutral material without any special physical properties. Component 20b of the optical<br>
code and component 20d "PL" are formed by magnetic coating 40. Component 20c of<br>
the optical code is in turn formed by electroconductive coating 30. Character compo-<br>
nents 20a and 20d thus have different physical properties from each other, and trape-<br>
zoidal bars 20b, 20c also have different physical properties from each other but differ-<br>
ent ones from character components 20a, 20d. The viewer at first suspects nothing of<br>
these different properties since the coating materials of optical code 20 are indistin-<br>
guishable from each other to the naked eye. The coating is present on plastic carrier<br>
10, as in Fig. 1.<br>
Figure 4 shows inventive security element 1 whose optical code 20 is a bar code<br>
formed by uniformly spaced bars of different length. The viewer will at first think he is<br>
faced with a usual bar code. As can be seen by the side view of security element 1,<br>
however, the individual bars of bar code 20 are formed by different coating materials,<br>
namely by electroconductive coating portions 30, magnetic coating portions 40 and<br>
neutral coating portions 50 that are neither magnetic nor electroconductive. The ele-<br>
ment thus has conductivity code 30 due to electroconductive coating portions 30,<br>
magnetic code 40 due to magnetic coating portions 40, and optical code 20 due to the<br>
totality of electroconductive, magnetic and neutral coating portions 30, 40, 50.<br>
Coating portions 50 thus serve to complete optical code 20 and it would be suffi-<br>
cient, deviating from the view according to Figure 4, if coating portions 50 were only<br>
adjacent to magnetic and/or electroconductive portions 40, 30. However, this presup-<br>
poses very high production precision to avoid gaps between the individual coating por-<br>
tions. It is therefore preferred due to the simpler producibility in particular by printing<br>
technology to dispose the coating portions so that adjacent coating portions overlap.<br>
Production tolerances are uncritical in this case. The coating is present on plastic car-<br>
rier 10, as in Fig. 1.<br>
Figure 5 shows a further embodiment of inventive security element 1 wherein<br>
optical code 20 again comprises characters 20a and bars 20b, 20c. Bars 20c with the<br>
negative writing "PL" consist of electroconductive coating 30, and bar 20b with the<br>
negative writing "G&amp;D" consists of neutral, opaque printing ink 50. Electroconductive<br>
coating 30 thus forms a conductivity code that is not recognizable to the viewer in its<br>
special code form, since the viewer will assume that neutral coating area 50 is also part<br>
of the code. Additionally, the security element has a third code, namely magnetic code<br>
40 formed by printing magnetic ink 40 on bars 20a, 20b in certain portions. The partial<br>
areas of magnetic code 40 are located outside negative writing 20a so that magnetic<br>
code 40 can be produced as a classic bar code by printing technology in very simple<br>
fashion. The coating is present on plastic carrier 10, as in Fig. 1.<br>
Figure 6 in turn shows inventive security element 1 that confronts the viewer as a<br>
continuously coated security element with negative writing 20. The security element<br>
has conductivity code 30 and magnetic code 40 different therefrom, said codes being<br>
formed by corresponding coatings 30, 40. Areas of the security element not covered by<br>
coating areas 30, 40 were previously printed with neutral, opaque ink 50. However, the<br>
coating order is irrelevant for the purposes of the invention, since in any case the re-<br>
sulting security element 1 appears to be printed completely opaque and has the same<br>
appearance from both sides even in the case of a transparent element. The coating is<br>
present on plastic carrier 10, as in Fig. 1.<br>
In the case of a transparent security element, the coatings can also be present on<br>
different sides of carrier material 10.<br>
Areas 40 forming the magnetic code on the security element can be divided into<br>
subclasses that differ in their magnetic remanence and/or coercive field strength. These<br>
different classes of magnetic areas can be distinguished from each other in identifica-<br>
tion machines by their different magnetic properties. The different magnetic and ma-<br>
chine detectable properties of the subclasses can be adjusted by means of different<br>
magnetic materials or by means of a material varying in quantity and/or pigment dis-<br>
tribution. Pigment distribution refers for example to the pigment size or the packing of<br>
the pigments (density).<br>
The magnetic materials can be both hard- and soft-magnetic materials and mix-<br>
tures thereof.<br>
Magnetic inks that can be used are hard-magnetic pigments incorporated in<br>
binder, for example Fe3O4, and soft-magnetic powder inks, for example of Fe or NiFe.<br>
Electroconductive areas 30 are produced just like magnetic areas 40 e.g. by<br>
means of printing inks by printing technology. This has the advantage that the optical<br>
appearance of the electroconductive ink can be readily adapted to the optical appear-<br>
ance of the magnetic ink. In addition it is possible without effort to provide gaps or<br>
special contours in the electroconductive coating for forming the optical code without<br>
any need for an elaborate demetalizing process for example. For printing the conduc-<br>
tive areas it is possible to use for example inks like Electrodag from Acheson Indus-<br>
tries or carbon black incorporated in binder, e.g. Printex XE2B from Degussa-Hüls<br>
AG.<br>
