The present invention relates to a method for generating a power control command n<br>
a transceiver in a wireless communication system. The invention also relates to a<br>
power control unit and a computer readable medium configured to implement the<br>
method and a wireless communication transceiver comprising the power control unit<br>
The present invention further relates to a method for controlling a power level of<br>
signals trensmitted in a wireless communication system to a first transceiver from a<br>
second transceiver.<br>
Description of Related Art<br>
In wireless communications systems the transmission channel between a transmitter<br>
in a transceiver and a receiver in another transceiver is formed by a radio link As an<br>
example, the transmitter could be included in a base station, and the receiver could<br>
be included in a user equipment, such as a mobile station (for the downlink<br>
transmission direction), or vice versa (for the uplink transmission direction)<br>
Power control in wireless communications systems is employed to compensate for<br>
variations in the channel (such as propagation delays and fading effects) and to<br>
ensure that an acceptable transmission quality for all users in the system is<br>
maintained<br>
Multipath fading is due to reflections of a propagating radio signal sent from a<br>
transmitter to a receiver It could cause a power level of a received signal to vary<br>
very rapidly with deep fading dips now and then To compensate for this effect, a<br>
closed power control loop is typically used<br>
2<br><br>
In many wireless communication systems, such as WCDMA (Wideband Code<br>
Division Multiple Access), power is the most important resource since different users<br>
on different channels are transmittin  simultaneously on the same radio frequency It<br>
is therefore important to keep the transmitted power level on each channel as low as<br>
possible, while maintaining an acceptable performance quality at the receiver Also,<br>
in WCDMA, the "near-far" problem needs to be minimized Near-far refers to the<br>
ratio of signal strength from a mobile station close to a base station to a mobile<br>
station far away from the base station, which needs to be as close to unity as possible<br>
(1 e the base station needs to receive signal power of the same order from all mobile<br>
stations irrespective of their distance from the base station, to avoid one user<br>
blocking the others)<br>
The solution is typically a closed power control loop which adjusts the transmitted<br>
power m order to maintain a received and estimated Signal-to-Interference Ratio<br>
(SIR) value at a given target value (a SIR reference value) In the 3GPP (Third<br>
Generation Partnership Project) solution for a WCDMA system specification number<br>
25 214, "Physical layer procedures (FDD)", power control for a WCDMA system is<br>
described. The closed power control loop for WCDMA, uplink or downlink,<br>
typically comprises elements to form an inner power control loop and an outer power<br>
control loop in a receiver of a device in the wireless communication system<br>
The outer power control loop typically sets the SIR reference value based on a<br>
deviation of an estimated block error rate (BLER) value from a BLER reference<br>
value. The inner power control loop compares the estimated SIR value to the SIR<br>
reference value Based on this comparison, the inner loop sets a power request, a<br>
Transmit Power Control (TPC) command, to be sent to a transmitter of another<br>
device in the wireless communication system The TPC command indicates if a<br>
requested change is to increase or to decrease the transmitted power. The outer loop<br>
typically operates at a rate much lower than that of the inner loop For a 3 GPP<br>
WCDMA system the outer loop operation performs at a rate of 10-100 Hz, whereas<br>
the inner loop operation may perform at a rate of 1500 Hz<br>
3<br><br>
In a WCDMA system a number of data bits are typically collected in a transport<br>
block and several transport blocks are contained in a Transmission Time Interval<br>
(TFI) A transport block comprises a number (1-8) of frames (each 10 ms)<br>
transmitted during a TTI A receiver, in order to decode the data in the transport<br>
block, typically needs to receive the complete TTI, and the outer power control loop<br>
updates the SIR reference value once every TTI, which is 10-80 ms for the 3GPP<br>
WCDMA system<br>
The actual SIR value will however vary within the TTI, even if the SIR reference<br>
value is kept constant within this time. Thus the TPC commands that are produced on<br>
a slot-by-slot basis during a TTI may be optimal for the first slot, but non-optimal for<br>
the rest of the slots in the same TTI<br>
The published patent applications WO 03/055098, WO 01/20808 and US<br>
2002/0187802 are examples of prior art documents in the same technical area<br>
WO 03/055098 describes a power control method, which is complemented with soft<br>
information (such as an uncoded bite error rate) estimation and extra regulation for<br>
producing a SIR reference based a comparison between the uncoded bit error rate<br>
estimate and an uncoded bit error rate reference<br>
It is a pu/pose of one or more embodiments of the present invention to provide a<br>
method of generating and updating or modifying the SIR reference value several<br>
times during a TTI in such a way that the effect of varying SIR values during the TTI<br>
is minimized<br>
Summary<br>
According to one or more embodiments of the invention the above and other<br>
problems are solved by a method for generating a power control command in a<br>
transceiver (such as a mobile station or a base station) in a wireless communication<br>
system   The method comprises the steps of calculating, at the beginning of a<br><br>
predefined time period, a quality measure reference value, generating, repeatedly<br>
during the predefined time period, an estimated quality measure value of a signal<br>
received at the transceiver, generating a power control command in dependence of<br>
the estimated quality measure value and the quality measure reference value, and<br>
generating, a number of times during the predefined time period, a modified quality<br>
measure reference value from the quality measure reference value The step of<br>
generating the power control command comprises comparing the estimated quality<br>
measure value with the modified quality measure reference value<br>
The step of generating the modified quality measure reference value comprises<br>
calculating, at a given point in time during he predefined time penod, an effective<br>
quality measure value from estimated quality measure values previously generated<br>
and generating the modified quality measure reference value in dependence of a<br>
difference between the effective quality measure value and said quality measure<br>
reference value. The method is thus adjusting the reference value for the quality<br>
measure taking the variations in estimated quality measure values into account by<br>
generating this effective quality measure value, which corresponds to the duality<br>
measure at a certain constant value<br>
The step of calculating the effective quality measure value may comprise calculating<br>
at one or more of a linear average, an exponential average or a logarithmic average<br>
from the estimated quality measure values previously generated<br>
The step of generating the modified quality measure reference value may also<br>
comprise setting the modified quality measure reference value to a predetermined<br>
threshold value for a remaining time of the predefined time penod, where the<br>
predefined time penod may be divided into a number of sub penods, if the value of<br>
the modified quality measure reference value for a next sub penod becomes zero or<br>
negative. The predetermined threshold value may for example be set to zero<br>
According to one or more embodiments of the invention a computer readable<br>
medium are configured to implement the method for generating a power control<br>
command<br>
5<br><br>

reference value, generating, repeatedly during the predefined time period, an<br>
estimated quality measure value of a signal received at the first transceiver,<br>
generating a power control command in dependence of the estimated quality measure<br>
value and the quality measure reference value; transmitting the power control<br>
command to the second transceiver, adjusting in the second transceiver, in<br>
dependence of the power control command, the power levels of signals transmitted to<br>
the first transceiver, and generating, a number of times during the predefined time<br>
period, a modified quality measure reference value from the quality measure<br>
reference value The step of generating the power control command comprises<br>
comparing the estimated quality measure value with the modified quality measure<br>
reference value<br>
The first transceiver may be a mobile station and the second transceiver may be a<br>
base station in the wireless communication system, or the first transceiver may be a<br>
base station and the second transceiver may be a mobile station<br>
The step of generating the modified quality measure reference value may comprise<br>
calculating, at a given point in time during the predefined time period, an effective<br>
quality measure value from estimated quality measure values previously generated<br>
and generating the modified quality measure reference value in dependence of a<br>
difference between the effective quality measure value and said quality measure<br>
reference value<br>
The method is thus adjusting the reference value for the quality measure taking the<br>
variations in estimated quality measure value into account by generating this<br>
effective quality measure value, which corresponds to the quality measure at a<br>
certain constant value<br>
6<br><br>
Further, the step of calculating the effective quality measure value may comprise<br>
calculating one or more of a linear average, an exponential average or a logarithmic<br>
average from the estimated quality measure values previously generated<br>
The step of generating the modified quality measure reference value may also<br>
comprise setting the modified quality measure reference value to a predetermined<br>
threshold value for a remaining time of the predefined time period, where the<br>
predefined t»me period may be divided into a number of sub periods, if the value of<br>
the modified quality measure reference value for a next sub penod becomes zero or<br>
negative. The predetermined threshold value may for example be set to zero.<br>
In yet an alternative embodiment, there is provided a power control unit in a<br>
transceiver (such as a mobile station or a base station) in a wireless communications<br>
system The power control unit comprises a first controller configured to calculate,<br>
at the beginning of a predefined time penod, a quahty measure reference value and a<br>
quality measure estimator configured to generate, repeatedly during the predefined<br>
time penod, an estimated quality measure value of a signal received at the<br>
transceiver. The power control unit may also compnse an inner loop element<br>
configured to generate a power control command in dependence of the estimated<br>
quality measure value and the quality measure reference value The power control<br>
unit may further compnse a second controller configured to generate, a number of<br>
times dunng the predefined time penod, a modified quality measure reference value<br>
from the quality measure reference value The inner loop element, which may be a<br>
third controller, may be configured to generate the power control command by<br>
comparing the estimated quality measure value with the modified quality measure<br>
reference value.<br>
The power control unit may further compnse a calculator configured to calculate, at<br>
a given point in time dunng the predefined time penod, an effective quality measure<br>
value from estimated quality measure values previously generated The second<br>
controller is configured to generate the modified quality measure reference value in<br>
dependence of a difference between the effective quality measure value and the said<br>
7<br><br>
quality measure reference value<br>
In particular, the calculator may be configured to generate the effective quality<br>
measure value by calculating one or more of a linear average, an exponential average<br>
or a logarithmic average of the estimated quality measure values previously<br>
generated<br>
Further, the second controller may further be configured to generate the modified<br>
quality measure reference value as a predetermined threshold value for a remaming<br>
time of the predefined time period, where the predefined time period may be divided<br>
into a nurober of sub periods, if the value of tne modified quality measure reference<br>
value for a next sub period becomes zero or negative. The predetermined threshold<br>
value may for example be set to zero<br>
The power control unit may further be included in a wireless communication<br>
transceiver, which may be a mobile station or a base station<br>
For the various embodiments, the estimated quality measure value may be an<br>
estimated signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) value and the quality measure reference<br>
value may be a SIR reference value The estimated SIR value may be estimated<br>
based on received pilot symbols Similarly, the effective quality measure value may<br>
be an effective SIR value and the modified quality measure reference value may be a<br>
modified SIR reference value<br>
Further, for the various embodiments, the predefined time period may be divided into<br>
a number of sub periods. Generating the modified quality measure reference value<br>
may be done each sub period More particularly, the predefined time period may be<br>
one or more transmission time intervals in a wideband code division multiple access<br>
(WCDMA) system and the sub period may be a slot or a fraction of a slot in a<br>
WCDMA system<br>
According to the various embodiments of the invention, the quality measure<br>
reference value, such as an SIR reference value, will be adjusted and updated more<br>
8<br><br>
often than in the prior art solutions, allowing power control commands to be<br>
generated more accurately Hereby a power control system implementing these<br>
methods will operate more efficiently and the overall wireless communication<br>
system capacity will be increased. In addition, unnecessary power requests from the<br>
various users of the wireless communication system may be avoided<br>
The above features and advantages do not limit the present invention, and those<br>
skilled in the art will recognize additional features and advantages upon reading the<br>
following detailed description, and upon viewing the accompanying drawings.<br>

Detailed Description<br>
Fig 1 illustrates a power control system 600 operating as a closed power control loop<br>
in one direction in a wireless communication system The power control system 600<br>
comprises at least a first transceiver 601 and a second transceiver 602 They<br>
communicate with each other over a wireless transmission channel 603 with radio<br>
signals carrying different kinds of information The first transceiver 601 comprises at<br>
least a first receiver 604, at least a first transmitter 605 and at least one power control<br>
unit 606, which for example may be the power control unit 100 or 300 to be<br>
described below in relation to Fig 2 and Fig 4 The second transceiver 602<br>
comprises at least a second receiver 607 and at least a second transmitter 608. If the<br>
first transceiver 601 is a base station and/or a radio network controller in the wireless<br>
communication system, the power control system 600 is employed for the uplink<br>
transmission direction; and vice versa, if the first transceiver 601 is a mobile unit in<br>
the mobile communication system, the power control system 600 is employed for the<br>
downlink tiansmission direction However, the power control system may usefully<br>
be employed in both the uplink and the downlink If so, the uplink scenario the<br>
second transceiver would also comprise a second power control unit. However, for<br>
the purpose of simplifying the description of the power control system 600, the<br>
power control unit 606 is in Fig 1 only shown in the first transceiver 601 An<br>
information signal 609 is transmitted from the second transmitter 608 over the<br>
wireless transmission channel 603, which affects the signal in a random and<br>
unknown manner before it is received by the first receiver 604 The first receiver 604<br>
processes the signal, by for example amplifiying, filtering, frequency<br>
downconverting, sampling, despreading, decoding and demterleaving, and forms a<br>
processed received signal 610, which is input to the power control unit 606, which<br>
10<br><br>
produces the transmit power control (TPC) command 611. The TPC command 611 is<br>
processed by the first transmitter 605 to form a radio signal 612 carrying the TPC<br>
command for transmission over the wireless transmission channel 603 The TPC<br>
radio signal 612 is received and processed by the second receiver 607 to form a<br>
control signal 613, vhich is input to control the power level of the second transmitter<br>
608 The transmitted data signal 609 is then controlled in its transmitted power<br>
Fig. 2 shows a schematic block diagram of a prior art power control unit 100 used in<br>
a transceiver of a device in a WCDMA wireless communication system based on the<br>
3GPP specification, where power control typically is supported in both uplink and<br>
downlink propagation directions The power control unit 100 will be associated with<br>
a receiver of the base station for the uplink power control and with a receiver of the<br>
mobile station for the downlink power control<br>
The purpose of the outer power control loop in a device in the wireless<br>
communicationsystem is to set ana continuously adjust a reference value for a signal<br>
quality measure for the inner power control loop to aim at Typically, the quality<br>
measure value is a signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) value, and the quality measure<br>
reference- value is a SIR reference value 102 A SIR estimator 106 generates a SIR<br>
estimate value 103 from received pilot symbols 107 and provides the SIR estimate<br>
value 103 to an inner loop element 104 Since the pilot symbols 107 are known at the<br>
receiver and have experienced the same propagation conditions on the wireless<br>
transmission channel as the information signal, the SIR value for the information<br>
signal may be estimated<br>
The inner power control loop element 104 affects a new SIR value by producing<br>
Transmit Power Control (TPC) commands 105 to be sent to another device (not<br>
shown) in the wireless communication system informing how that device should<br>
adjust its transmitted power The transmitted power is typically adjusted in a<br>
predetermined manner. If the SIR estimate value 103 is below the SIR reference<br>
value 102, a TPC command 105 is sent to the transceiver of the other device to<br>
11<br><br>
increase its power, and if the SIR estimate value 103 is above the SIR reference<br>
value 102, a TPC command 105 is sent to the transceiver of the other device to<br>
decrease its power The transmitted power is typically adjusted in discrete steps in<br>
decibels (dB) The step size is network parameter configured by the wireless<br>
communication system and it is for WCDMA ± 0 5,1; 1 5 or 2 dB A new TPC<br>
command 105 is sent every slot, which is every 10/15= 0 667 ms, or equivalent: the<br>
inner loop 104 is working at a frequency of 1500 Hz to compensate for fast fading<br>
The SIR reference value 102 is generated and controlled by an outer control loop<br>
element 101 based on a Block Error Rate (BLER) reference value 108, which is a<br>
network parameter set by the wireless communication system, and an estimated<br>
BLER value 109, an additional quality measure for the received blocks of data A<br>
BLER estimator 110 bases its estimation for the estimated BLER value for a<br>
transport channel on Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) error oits on each block of<br>
data. These bits have special coding properties, such that if they are found to be in<br>
error, the bits in the transport block are considered decoded in er-or by the receiver.<br>
The receiver processes the CRC error bits and forms a CRC error flag 111 If this<br>
flag is in a state of "not set", it is assumed that it will be possible to correctly recover<br>
the block of data in the receiver Otherwise, if the flag is "set" the whole block of<br>
data is considered to be erroneous The estimated BLER value for a transport channel<br>
is found by processing the CRC error flags 111 in the BLER estimator 110<br>
The outer control loop element 101 updates the SIR reference value 102 once every<br>
Transmission Time Interval (TTI), which is 10-80 ms for the 3GPP WCDMA<br>
system. A transport or code block comprises a number (1-8) of frames (each of 10<br>
ms duration) transmitted during a TTI The outer loop operates thus much slower<br>
than the inner loop, which instead updates the TPC command 105 every slot (0 667<br>
ms).<br>
In Fig 3, a typical timing structure in a WCDMA system is illustrated A TTI 201<br>
consists of 1 up to 8 radio frames 202 Each frame 202 of 10 ms is split into 15 slots<br>
12<br><br>
203, each of length 2560 chips (0 26 ms per chip) or 10/15= 0 667 ms in time Each<br>
slot 203 corresponds to one power control period for the inner loop For example, on<br>
the dedicated downlink physical WCDMA channel (DPCH) each slot 203 carries the<br>
data bits, the TPC command, the pilot bits and a Transport Channel Indicator (TPCI).<br>
The data and the pilot bits are encodec as symbols (not shown), each representing a<br>
number of bits. The total number of bits in a slot is determined by the WCDMA<br>
spreading factor (SF). The value of the SF is, for WCDMA, in the range of 2 to 512<br>
The main purpose of power control in a wireless communication system is typically<br>
to control the sent power from the transmitters, in such a way that a quality measure<br>
at a receiver is maintained at and follows a given reference value. Different systems<br>
may use different quality measures and combinations of different quality measures.<br>
In a WCDMA solution, the BLER reference value 108 may for example be updated<br>
every TTI, but in reality updating the BLER reference value 108 is done even less<br>
often. The SIR reference value 102 is in the prior art solutions typically kept constant<br>
for each TTI, which may be as long as 80 ms, depending on the number of frames<br>
per TTI In reality the actual SIR value, and thus the SIR estimate value 103, varies<br>
during this time. This is due to the effects of fading, noise and other disturbances,<br>
which m turn depend on the relative movement of the receiver of one device and the<br>
transmitter of another device, which are usually difficult to fully compensate for by<br>
power control<br>
For this reason the TPC command 105 may be updated based on a SIR reference<br>
value 102 that is no longer the ideal reference value for the remaining time of the<br>
TTI The BLER value is a measured or estimated quality measure and it depends, for<br>
a received transport block, on the SIR variations during a corresponding TTI  This<br>
means that the BLER value will vary between TTIs with the same SIR reference<br>
value, which may result in either too high BLER or unnecessarily high power<br>
requests from the transmitter, which in turn results in reduced system capacity, e g. a<br>
reduced number of simultaneous users in the communication system<br>
13<br><br>
One purpose of embodiments of the present invention is therefore to adjust the<br>
reference value for the quality measure taking these variations into account. This is<br>
achieved by computing an effective new quality measure value, which corresponds<br>
to a constant quality measure value resulting in the same BLER value. A quality<br>
measure reference value is further generated by a first controller in the outer loop<br>
element and input to a new second controller or regulator included in, or associated<br>
with, the outer loop element or the inner loop element The quality measure reference<br>
value may for example be generated once every predefined time period, and is<br>
generated based on a regulation of the estimated BLER value towards the BLER<br>
reference value. The predefined time period may be a TTI or a certain number of<br>
TTIs The second controller in turn generates a modified quality measure reference<br>
value a number of times during the predefined time period, such as once every sub<br>
period, e g once per slot, based on a difference between a calculated effective quality<br>
measure value and the original quality measure reference value (that was generated<br>
by the first controller) An effective quality measure value calculator, which may be<br>
included in, or associated with, the outer loop element or the inner loop element,<br>
derives the effective quality measure value, as will be described in detail below,<br>
based on the estimated quality measure value The modified quality measure<br>
reference value and the estimated quality measure value are further input to a third<br>
controller, the inner loop element, which compares the modified quality measure<br>
reference value with the estimated quality measure value and generates a power<br>
control command once every sub period, in dependence of the comparison  The<br>
power control command indicates a required power adjustment for the signals of<br>
another transmitting wireless communication device<br>
For the sake of illustration we now refer to SIR as the quality measure for the inner<br>
loop element and BLER as an additional quality measure for the outer loop element,<br>
but it should be understood that the invention is not limited to this combination of<br>
quality measures Bit error rate (BER) is another possible quality measure choice for<br>
the outer loop element for example<br>
14<br><br>
The BLER value depends on the SIR values during a corresponding TT1. If the SIR<br>
value were to be constant there would be a relationship between tlie SIR value and<br>
the BLER value such that a higher SIR value would represent a lower BLER value<br>
and vice versa However, the SIR value is in reality varying, but the receiver needs to<br>
maintain a constant (low) BLER For example, when the SIR value is varying during<br>
a TTI it would be beneficial to compute, or predict, a value of a constant SIR that<br>
would correspond to a certain BLER According to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention such a SIR value is computed to form an effective quality measure value,<br>
the effective SIR, denoted SIR in the following Thus, obtaining a certain BLER<br>
value is equivalent to obtaining a certain desired effective SIR value This effective<br>
SIR value is calculated based on a number of estimated SIR values during the current<br>
time period, for example a TTI The value of SIR is updated each sub period, for<br>
example each slot In one or more embodiments of the invention the SIR reference<br>
value is adjusted several times during a time period, 1 e several times during a TTI<br>
A new modified SIR reference value is generated based on the certain effective SIR<br>
several times during the predefined time period, such as once every sub period,<br>
which may be for example a slot, or a fraction of a slot<br>
The SIR value may be an average value of the different SIR values during the<br>
duration of a TTI, which may e g be 1,2,4 or 8 frames By predicting the SIR value<br>
and allowing the SIR reference value to be updated within the predefined time<br>
period, e g. the TTI, the effects of varying SIR estimate values are taken into account<br>
in the power control system<br>
15<br>
The SIR value may be defined and predicted or calculated in various ways.<br>
Examples of definitions are shown in equations 1,2 and 3<br>
A Linear effective SIR, is a linear average and is defined by<br><br><br>
where N is the number of SIR values obtained during the predefined time period, for<br>
example during the TTI Nmay thus also be equal to the number of sub periods<br>
comprised in the TTI. If for example a new SIR value is estimated every slot, N will<br>
be equal to the number of slots in the TTI, which for WCDMA is an integer between<br>
1 and 8. It should be noted, however, that the SIR may be calculated for any sub<br>
period and N need thus not be the number of sub periods in the time period<br><br>
As yet another alternative, an Exponential effective SIR may be used, and it is<br>
defined by<br>
Alternatively, a Logarithmic effective SIR may be used It is defined by<br><br>
These definitions has empirically been found to map the effective SIR on to a BLER<br>
in slightly different ways, thus different implementations may use different<br>
definitions The Linear effective SIR and the Logarithmic effective SIR have been<br>
found to be most useful, if the SIR variations are small, and in a range of low SIR<br>
values; whereas the Exponential effective SIR provides a low uncertainty mapping<br>
for larger SIR variations as well Alternatively, different combinations of definitions<br>
may be used for calculating the effective SIR, based on the range of the estimated<br>
SIR values.<br>
With reference now to Fig 4, a block diagram of an example of a power control unit<br>
300 according to one or more embodiments of the present invention is illustrated A<br>
power control unit 300 that comprises a first controller 303, a second controller 302<br>
16<br><br>
and a third controller 312 is shown  The controllers may be realized for example as<br>
PI or PID regulators, although other regulators may be used The power control unit<br>
300 comprises a first controller 303, which may be a BLER controller (outer Icop<br>
controller), which compares a BLER estimate value 304 (estimated in a BLER<br>
estimator 316 based on CRC error flags 315) with a BLER reference value 305 and<br>
generates a quality measure reference value, here denoted SIR reference value, 306<br>
once every predefined time period, for example once per TTI Compared to the prior<br>
art in Fig. 2, the power control urrt 300 comprises an additional regulator element,<br>
the second controller 302, which may be a SIR controller. The SIR reference value<br>
306 is input to the second controller, the SIR controller 302 Additionally, a SIR<br>
estimate value 307 is produced by the SIR estimator 308 based on received and<br>
processed pilot symbols 314, repeatedly during the TTI, such as once every sub<br>
period, for example once every slot The SIR estimate value 307 is input to the third<br>
controller, an inner loop element 312 According to one or more embodiments of the<br>
invention, is the SIR estimate value 307 also input to a SIR calculator 310 The<br>
SIR calculator 310 calculates the effective SIR value, SIR 311, by for exarrple any<br>
of the equations 1,2 or 3, based on the SIR estimate value 307 The SIR 311 maybe<br>
generated and updated once per sub period The SIR calculator 310 and the second<br>
controller 302 may be included, oi associated with either of the outer loop controller<br>
303 or the inner loop element H2 The SIR value 311 is input to the SIR controller<br>
302, which compares the SIR value 311 with the SIR reference value 306 and<br>
produces a modified SIR reference value 309 This is performed a number of times<br>
during the TTI, such as once per slot This modified reference value is thus updated<br>
several times within the time period of a TTI The modified SIR reference value 309<br>
may be generated once every sub period and is the reference input to the third<br>
controller 104, the inner loop element The purpose of the controlling performed by<br>
the SIR controller 302 is to minimize the error (effective SIR error) between the<br>
requested effective SIR value, which is the SIR reference value 306, and the actual<br>
17<br><br>
effective SIR value 311, by updating the modified SIR reference value 309 several<br>
times during the predefined time period<br>
In the following, the terminology for a SIR reference value will be SlRref and for a<br>
modified SIR reference value, SIR ref <br>
The SIR calculator 310 further needs to keep track of the timing, at which instant<br>
within the TTI the present SIR value relates to The power control unit 300 may<br>
therefore be associated with a timer for registering an expiration of the predefined<br>
time period and registration of the sub periods  The timer is accordingly updated for<br>
keeping track of which sub period, of the N possible sub periods in the predefined<br>
timee period, is being processed<br>
It should be understood that the illustration of Fig 4 may or may not represent<br>
physical circuit implementations, depending for example on whether the power<br>
control unit 300 is implemented in hardware or software, or in some combination<br>
thereof. For example, in software-based implementation, the illustrated elements may<br>
comprise processing functions implemented by stored computer program<br>
instructions, or microcode, etc<br>
An optimisation with respect to modified SIR reference values at each slot may be<br>
done over many TTIs A weight on the modified SIR reference value may be<br>
included in the optimisation in order to keep the modified SIR reference value as<br>
small as possible.<br>
In an example of an embodiment of the invention, the optimisation works to<br>
18<br>
minimize the effective SIR error, and is performed by minimizing the absolute<br>
effective SIR error over MTTI time periods This error is shown in equation 4.<br><br><br>
A new optimal selection, according to the above criteria, of a modified SIR reference<br>
value may be computed every time a new SIR measurement or estimation is made,<br>
that is, each sub period, for example once every slot<br>
In the optimisation several considerations need to be taken into account, such as the<br>
dynamics between the modified SIR reference value and actual SIR value and such<br>
as limitations and constraints on the SIR value and the rate of change of the SIR<br>
values. For example, in a WCDMA system, there are limitations such as allowed<br>
power step sizes and how often to change the SIR value In WCDMA it is only<br>
possible to change a SIR reference value betwsen consecutive slots The power is<br>
decreased or increased in fixed steps of usually 1 dB<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, an optimisation is performed considering<br>
only the current TTI (M=l) and with respect to the remaining modified SIR reference<br>
values of that TTI at a specific sub period in the time period,<br><br>
for N-n remaining modified SIR reference values, where N is the total number of<br>
SIR values during a time period, for example a TTI At the end of a TTI, when<br>
running out of time to obtain the correct effective SIR, the optimal values of the<br>
modified SIR reference 309 will, typically, deviate more from the original SIR<br>
reference value 306 The final modified SIR reference value, SIRref (N), may be far<br>
from the original SIR reference value, the SIR reference value 306 This may cause<br>
a control problem for the subsequent TTI since instant changes of the SIR value are<br>
prevented by dynamics Therefore, in yet another embodiment of the invention a<br>
suitable weight or constraint is placed on the final modified SIR reference value to<br>
improve the performance of the control loop for subsequent transmission time<br>
intervals<br>
19<br><br>
The solutions presented above result in time-varying control algorithms, but time-<br>
mvanant control algorithms may also be considered<br>
Now a discussion in greater detail will be given for an example of an embodiment of<br>
a control algorithm for the SIR controller 302 This algorithm may be realized with<br>
low complexity for the solution when considering only a current TTI (M=1) and with<br>
respect to the remaining modified SIR reference values of that "?TI. It we assume that<br>
there is a new SIR reference value estimated every sub period, which may for<br>
example be a slot of a TTI, and that For (at a specific slot number, n) the remaining<br>
slots of the predefined time period, such as the TTI, it is possible to obtain<br>
SIR(n) = SlRref (n), then it will be possible with instantaneous changes of the SIR<br>
value. Then the optimisation may be done for each TTI individually.<br>
Again, the terminology for a SIR reference value 306 will be SlRref and for a S'R<br>
reference value 309, SIRref<br>
20<br>
Fig 5a and Fig 5b shows two examples of graphic illustrations of the criteria behind<br>
how to choose the modified SIR reference value at the slot number n+l, based on<br>
information up to slot number n For illustration purposes the SIR values are drawn<br>
as unrealistic straight lines At n, the modified SIR reference value needs to be<br>
chosen so that a goal for the SIR controller 302 is fulfilled, the goal being to<br>
produce SlRref values to obtain the same area, equal to N SIRref , below a<br>
SIRref  curve and a SIR curve during A' sub periods of the time period<br>
To obtain this goal, a value for the remaining modified SIR reference values,<br>
hereafter denoted AS(n+\), needs to be chosen at slot number n+\, where<br>
n+1={1   N), such that<br><br><br>
where Sn is the contribution to the area from n SIk values, an accumulated SIR<br>
value, and A5(n+l) is the contribution of the area from the remaining N- n SIR<br>
reference values yet to be obtained Fig 5a and Fig 5b illustrate two sceranos of<br>
SIR contribution to the area at slot number n Sn is for example calculated by one of<br>
equations 1-3 The SlKref  value was obtained by the comparison of the estimated<br>
BLER value with the BLER reference value in the BLER controller. Fig 5b shows a<br>
situation when a larger AS(n+1) is required compared with the situation in Fig 5a<br>
If the value of AS (n+1) at slot number n+1 becomes zero or negaive, the modified<br>
signal-to-interference ratio reference value needs to be set at a predetermined<br>
threshold value for the remaining time of the time period The threshold value could<br>
for example be set to zero.<br>
If the Linear effective SIR is used as the SIR definition, the remaining modified SIR<br>
reference values, i.e AS(n+1), should be chosen such that<br><br>
will be fulfilled.<br>
The first part of the right-hand side of equation 6b is then equal to a definition of Sn<br>
with Linear effective SIR and the second part is equal to the design choice of<br>
AS(n+1).<br>
21<br>
Equation 6b may be rewritten as<br><br><br>
Equation 8 may be expressed in terms of the definitions in equation 6a as<br>
If all remaining modified SIR reference values are chosen to be equal, the smallest<br>
variance in the actual SIR is obtained This means that the modified new SIR<br>
reference value at the next instant in time, at slot r,+l, should be chosen such that<br><br><br><br>
Alternatively, using the Exponential effective SIR instead, the smallest SIR variance<br>
is obtained if the modified new SIR reference value is chosen such that<br><br><br>
Yet an alternative equation for a modified new SIR reference value to be obtained at<br>
n+1 is shown in Equation 11, when based on the Logarithmic effective SIR<br>
22<br><br><br><br>
Here the corresponding definitions become<br><br>
The factor K, is a constant that determines the number of slots during which an<br>
incorrect effective SIR may be corrected The correction may be spread out for a<br>
number of slots Correction during one slot corresponds to Kl = 1,1 e all correction<br>
is pe formed once only, and correction during a fixed number of slots corresponds to<br>
a constant Kt 
estimated SIR and SIRref  for the previous slots<br>
A negative modified SIR reference value corresponds to a situation where there is<br>
knowledge of the system that the effective SIR value for the current TTI will be high<br>
enough. Then the transmitter may turn off its power resulting in a zero SIR value<br>
Fig. 6 is a flow diagram that illustrates an example of a method 500 for determining a<br>
modified SIR reference value at a slot n+\ by use of an effective SIR value In the<br>
following the example of the linear effective SIR is used The sub period is within<br>
the predefined time period and method 500 runs once every sub period for all N sub<br>
periods within the predefined time period In the following, the sub period is<br>
assumed to be a slot and the predefined time period is a TTI in a WCDMA wireless<br>
system, however the time periods of the present invention are not limited to these<br>
time periods<br>
23<br><br>
At step 501, a SIR estimate value is generated based on received pilot symbols and<br>
the estimate is input to the SIR calculator at a slot n Further a SIR reference value,<br>
which has been generated by the BLER controller based on the BLER reference<br>
value and the estimated BLER value, is input to the SIR controller Then the method<br>
proceeds to step 502, in which the SIR calculator updates an accumulated SIR<br>
value, Sn, with the current estimated SIR value Sn is the SIR based on slot number<br>
1    n Sn  is input to the SIR controller and then the method proceeds with step 504<br>
At step 504, a check is made if it is the start of a new TTI If n=N the previous TTI<br>
has just finished, thus a new TTI is at hand If this is the case, ihe accumulated SIR<br>
value, Sn and n are set to zero at an initialisation step 503 If in step 504 it was<br>
found that we are not at the beginning of a new TTI, ∆S(N+1) is calculated<br>
according to equation 6a at step 505 It may graphically be viewed as the right-most<br>
area in any of the graphs in Fig 5a or Fig 5b This area illustrates the remaining<br>
modified SIR reference values times the time left of the TTI Then at step 506, the<br>
modified SIR reference value, valid for slot number n+\, is generated by the SIR<br>
controller according to any of equations 8, 9,10 or 11, depending on which<br>
definition of the effective SIR was used<br>
The modified SIR reference value is then output from the SIR controller and input to<br>
the inner loop controller at step 507 Then the time slot number n is updated at step<br>
508. Then the process starts over at step 501 This modified SIR reference value is<br>
now assumed to be valid for all remaining slots up to N, however in the next run the<br>
modified SIR reference value is updated again with a new value The prccess thus<br>
runs though a whole TTI with a new update of the modified SIR reference value<br>
every slot<br>
In reality, instantaneous changes in the modified SIR reference value are, as<br>
discussed previously, not utilized, but instead the modified SIR reference value will<br>
need to be changed by a fixed step, by for example 1 dB When approaching the end<br>
24<br><br>
of a TTI, with a limited amount of time left to reach the wanted level of the SIR<br>
reference value, there may be problem of unwanted large variations up and down in<br>
the SIR value Thus, there may be a need to fulfil an end condition with a set final<br>
value constraint<br>
So, in yet another embodiment of the invention, a final value constraint for the SIR<br>
value needs to be fulfilled, as will be discussed in greater detail below Here the<br>
Logarithmic effective SIR, as defined by equation 2, is used for illustration.<br>
Keeping the current modified SIR reference value until getting close to the end of the<br>
TTI, and then ramping it (stepwise) to the correct value, i.e the SIR reference value,<br>
provided that the SIR value is equal to the SIR reference value, results in the<br>
following contribution to the effective SIR, A(n)<br><br>
where SIR dBstep is the SIR step size m decibels (dB) and where the first part of the<br>
right hand side of equation 12 is analogous to the area below a SIR-vs -time curve<br>
without the ramping, and the second part is the area contribution from the ramping<br>
part A(n) is thus measured in decibels (dB)<br>
Either an increase or a decrease in the modified SIR reference value is performed<br>
depending on whether the expected contribution is too small or too large.<br>
This leads to a modified SIR reference value (in decibels) for the next time slot, n+\,<br>
which equals<br><br>
An end condition, when n is approaching N, needs to be satisfied and is given by the<br>
inequality<br>
25<br><br><br>
where nramp are an assumed average or typical number of steps needed by the ramp<br>
at the end of a TTI In this embodiment there will thus be a compromise between the<br>
wanted area and the last modified SIR reference value If the modified SIR reference<br>
value is to be at the level of the SIR reference value at the last slot of a TTI, in order<br>
to have an optimal starting value for the start of the next TTI, then the ramping down<br>
or up at the end may result in the total area slightly different from the intended,<br>
optimal, area<br>
In yet another alternative embodiment, the invention may further increase system<br>
capacity if it is utilized in a way that power is saved Due to coding it may be<br>
possible to predict the success of a current transmission of a block before all the bits<br>
of the coded block have been received The decoder may for example be able to<br>
reconstruct the full block before all the bits have been received Then it is possible to<br>
reduce the power, or equivalently the SIR value, during the remaining part of the<br>
TTI. This is possible due to the fact that the quality of the remaining bits will not<br>
have influence on the success of the current block reception This will decrease the<br>
power needed and thus increase system capacity<br>
In yet another embodiment, an effective SIR value may be used as an additional net<br>
planning parameter utilized by the base stations Then the SIR value associated with<br>
a certain mobile unit may be increased during parts of the TTI and decreased for<br>
other parts of the TTI provided that the effective SIR value, and thus the BLER<br>
26<br><br>
value, is the same This way of scheduling the transmitted power from each mobile<br>
unit in the system, also improves system capacity.<br>
With reference again to Fig 1, a power con'rol system is schematically shown in<br>
which the power control algorithms according to embodiments of the invention<br>
would operate The at least one power control unit 606, may for example be the<br>
