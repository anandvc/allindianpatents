				<td>SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR BEARING FAULT DETECTION USING<br>
STATOR CURRENT NOISE CANCELLATION<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
[0001] The present application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional application<br>
serial number 60/932,742, filed June 4, 2007, and which is incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to motors and, more particularly, to<br>
a system and method for detection of incipient conditions indicative of motor faults.<br>
[0003] Three-phase induction motors consume a large percentage of generated<br>
electricity capacity. Many applications for this "workhorse" of industry are fan and<br>
pump industrial applications. For example, in a typical integrated paper mill, low<br>
voltage and medium voltage motors may comprise nearly 70% of all driven electrical<br>
loads. Due to the prevalence of these motors in industry, it is paramount that the<br>
three-phase motor be reliable. Industry reliability surveys suggest that motor failures<br>
typically fall into one of four major categories. Specifically, motor faults typically<br>
result from bearing failure, stator turn faults, rotor bar failure, or other general<br>
faults/failures. Within these four categories: bearing, stator, and rotor failure account<br>
for approximately 85% of all motor failures.<br>
[0004| It is believed that this percentage could be significantly reduced if the<br>
driven equipment were better aligned when installed, and remained aligned regardless<br>
of changes in operating conditions. However, motors are often coupled to misaligned<br>
pump loads or loads with rotational unbalance and fail prematurely due to stresses<br>
imparted upon the motor bearings. Furthermore, manually detecting such fault<br>
causing conditions is difficult at best because doing so requires the motor to be<br>
running. As such, an operator is usually required to remove the motor from operation<br>
to perform a maintenance review and diagnosis. However, removing the motor from<br>
service is undesirable in many applications because motor down-time can be<br>
extremely costly.<br>
[0005] As such, some detection devices have been designed that generate feedback<br>
regarding an operating motor. The feedback is then reviewed by an operator to<br>
determine the operating conditions of the motor. However, most systems that monitor<br>
operating motors merely provide feedback of faults that have likely already damaged<br>
the motor. As such, though operational feedback is sent to the operator, it is usually<br>
too late for preventive action to be taken.<br>
Some systems have attempted to provide an operator with early fault<br>
warning feedback. For example, vibration monitoring has been utilized to provide<br>
some early misalignment or unbalance-based faults. However, when a mechanical<br>
resonance occurs, machine vibrations are amplified. Due to this amplification, false<br>
positives indicating severe mechanical asymmetry are possible. Furthermore,<br>
vibration based monitoring systems typically require highly invasive and specialized<br>
monitoring systems to be deployed within the motor system.<br>
In light of the drawbacks of vibration based monitoring, current-based<br>
monitoring techniques have been developed to provide a more inexpensive, non-<br>
intrusive technique for detecting bearing faults. There are also limitations and<br>
drawbacks to present current-based fault detection. That is, in current-based bearing<br>
fault detection, it can be challenging to extract a fault signature from the motor stator<br>
current. For different types of bearing faults, fault signatures can be in different<br>
forms. According to general fault development processes, bearing faults can be<br>
categorized as single-point defects or generalized roughness. Most current-based<br>
bearing fault detection techniques currently in use today are directed toward detecting<br>
single-point defects and rely on locating and processing the characteristic bearing<br>
fault frequencies in the stator current. Such techniques, however, may not be suitable<br>
for detecting generalized roughness faults. That is, generalized-roughness faults<br>
exhibit degraded bearing surfaces, but not necessarily distinguished defects and,<br>
therefore, characteristic fault frequencies may not necessarily exist in the stator<br>
current. As many bearing faults initially develop as generalized-roughness bearing<br>
faults, especially at an early stage, it would be beneficial for current-based bearing<br>
fault detection techniques to be able to detect such generalized-roughness bearing<br>
faults.<br>
[0008] It would therefore be desirable to design a current-based bearing fault<br>
detection technique that overcomes the aforementioned drawbacks. A current-based<br>
bearing fault detection technique that allows for detection of generalized-roughness<br>
bearing faults would be beneficial, by providing early stage detection of bearing<br>
faults.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0009] The present invention provides a system and method for detecting<br>
impending mechanical motor faults by way of current noise cancellation. Current<br>
data is decomposed into a non-fault component (i.e., noise) and a fault component,<br>
and noise-cancellation is performed to isolate the fault component of the current and<br>
generate a fault identifier.<br>
[0010] In accordance with one aspect of the invention, a controller configured to<br>
detect indicia of incipient mechanical motor faults includes a processor programmed<br>
to receive a set of current data from a motor during known normal operation, define a<br>
baseline noise based on the set of current data acquired from the know normal<br>
operating motor, and repeatedly receive real-time operating current data from the<br>
operating motor. The processor is further programmed to remove the baseline noise<br>
from the operating current data to identify any fault components present in the<br>
operating current data and generate a fault index for the operating current data based<br>
on any isolated fault components.<br>
[0011] In accordance with another aspect of the invention, a non-invasive method<br>
for detecting impending bearing faults in electric machines includes the steps of<br>
acquiring a plurality of stator current data sets from the electric machine during<br>
operation, applying each of the plurality of stator current data sets to a current data<br>
filter in real-time to generate a noise-cancelled stator current, and determining a fault<br>
index from the noise-cancelled stator current for each of the plurality of stator current<br>
data sets. The method also includes the steps of monitoring a value of the fault index<br>
for the plurality of stator current data sets and generating an alert if the value of a pre-<br>
determined number of fault indices exceeds a control limit.<br>
[0012] In accordance with yet another aspect of the invention, a system for<br>
monitoring current to predict bearing faults includes at least one non-invasive current<br>
sensor configured to acquire stator current data from an operating motor and a<br>
processor connected to receive the stator current data from the at least one non-<br>
invasive current sensor. The processor is programmed to receive a first set of stator<br>
current data from the at least one current sensor, the first set of stator current data<br>
comprising baseline current data representative of normal motor operation. The<br>
processor is also programmed to define a non-fault component from the baseline<br>
current data, repeatedly receive real-time operating current data from the operating<br>
motor, and remove the non-fault component from the operating current data in real-<br>
time to isolate residual current data. The processor is further programmed to process<br>
the residual current data to identify possible bearing faults; generate a fault index for<br>
any identified bearing faults and generate an alert if the fault index exceeds a fault<br>
index threshold.<br>
[0013] Various other features and advantages of the present invention will be made<br>
apparent from the following detailed description and the drawings.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
The embodiments of the invention set forth herein relate to the detection of<br>
abnormal conditions to predictively determine potential motor faults. Current<br>
signature analysis (CSA) is utilized to review raw data received from a plurality of<br>
sensors of a controller monitoring an operating motor. The system, which is<br>
preferably disposed within the controller, decomposes the sensed/monitored current<br>
into a non-fault component and a fault component, and performs a noise-cancellation<br>
operation to isolate the fault component of the current and generate a fault identifier.<br>
An operator of the monitored motor system is then proactively alerted of a potential<br>
fault prior to a fault occurrence.<br>
[0024] Referring now to Fig. 1, a motor assembly, such as an induction motor, is<br>
configured to drive a load. The motor assembly 10 includes a motor 12 that receives<br>
power from a power supply 14. The motor assembly 10 also includes a controller 16<br>
(i.e., current monitoring system) used to monitor, as well as control, operation of the<br>
motor 10 in response to operator inputs or motor fault conditions. The motor 12 and<br>
the controller 16 typically are coupled to electronic devices such as a power<br>
controller, or starter, 17 and are in series with the motor supply to control power to the<br>
motor 12. The controller 16 includes a processor 18 that, as will be described in<br>
greater detail with respect to Fig. 2, implements an algorithm to determine the<br>
presence of unwanted mechanical conditions and predictively alert an operator of a<br>
potential fault before a fault occurs. The controller 16 further includes current sensors<br>
22. According to an exemplary embodiment of the invention, it is understood that<br>
current sensors 22 are existing sensors used to also monitor current input to the motor<br>
and generally monitor motor operation. That is, a separate set of current sensors for<br>
acquiring current data for use in the noise-cancellation system/technique of the<br>
invention (described in detail below) arc not required. Thus, the acquisition of current<br>
data via current sensors 22 for use in the noise-cancellation system/technique is<br>
understood to form a "sensorless" current monitoring system/technique for<br>
predictively determining potential motor faults. As is generally known, current data<br>
may be acquired from only two of the phases of a three-phase motor as current data<br>
for the third phase may be extrapolated from the current data of the monitored two<br>
phases. While the present invention will be described with respect to a three-phase<br>
motor, the present invention is equivalently applicable to other motors. Additionally,<br>
while shown as including a pair of current sensors 22, it is also envisioned that a<br>
single current sensor could be used to acquire only one phase of current.<br>
[0025] In one embodiment of the invention, current sensors 22 acquire stator<br>
current data from an induction motor. The stator current data acquired from sensors<br>
22 is communicated to processor 18, where the current is analyzed using current<br>
signature analysis (CSA) to detect incipient (i.e., pending) motor faults, such as a<br>
bearing fault. As the identification of characteristic fault frequencies is not a viable<br>
solution for detection of all types of bearing faults (e.g., generalized roughness faults),<br>
according to an embodiment of the invention, processor 18 is programmed to treat the<br>
fault detection problem as a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) problem. Processor 18 is<br>
thus programmed to decompose the stator current into noise components and fault<br>
components (i.e., the bearing fault signal). The noise components are the dominant<br>
components in the stator current, and include supply fundamental frequencies and<br>
harmonics, eccentricity harmonics, slot harmonics, saturation harmonics, and other<br>
components from unknown sources, including environmental noises. Since these<br>
dominant components exist before and after the presence of a bearing fault, a large<br>
body of the information they contain is not related to the fault. In this sense, they can<br>
be treated as "noise" for the bearing fault detection problem. As the "noise" could be<br>
104 times stronger than the bearing fault signal (i.e., tens of Amperes vs. milli-<br>
Amperes), the detection of the bearing fault signal constitutes a low SNR problem.<br>
For solving the low SNR problem, processor 18 implements a noise cancellation<br>
technique/process for detecting the bearing fault signal. The noise components in the<br>
stator current are estimated and then cancelled by their estimates in a real-time<br>
fashion, thus providing a fault indicator from the remaining components.<br>
[0026] While processor 18 is shown as being included in a stand-alone controller<br>
16, it is also recognized that processor 18 could be included in power control/starter<br>
17. Additionally, it is recognized that processor 18 could be included in another<br>
power control device such as a meter, relay, or drive. That is, it is understood that<br>
controller 16 could comprise an existing power control device, such as a meter, relay,<br>
starter, or motor drive, and that processor 18 could be integrated therein.<br>
[0027] Referring now to Fig. 2, a more detailed block diagram of controller 16 is<br>
shown. As stated with respect to Fig. 1, the controller 16 includes processor 18 and<br>
current sensors 22. Furthermore, the relay assembly 16 includes a notch filter 24, a<br>
low pass filter 26, and an analog to digital (A/D) converter 28. The notch filter 24,<br>
low pass filter 26, and A/D convertor 28 operate to receive raw data generated by<br>
current sensors 22 and prepare the raw data for processing by processor 18. That is,<br>
filters 24 and 26 are used to eliminate the fundamental frequency (e.g. 60Hz in US<br>
and 50Hz in Asia) and low frequency harmonics, as these harmonic contents are not<br>
related to bearing failure. Removing such frequencies (especially the base frequency<br>
component) from the measured current data can greatly improve the analog-to-digital<br>
conversion resolution and SNR, as the 60Hz frequency has a large magnitude in the<br>
frequency spectrum of the current signal. While controller 16 is shown as including<br>
filters 24, 26, it is also envisioned, however, that current data could be passed directly<br>
from current sensors 22 to the A/D convertor 28.<br>
As shown in Fig. 2, processor 18 functions, at least in part, as a noise<br>
cancellation system that decomposes the stator current into noise components and<br>
fault components. Processor 18 thus includes an input delay 30 and a current<br>
predictor 32, with the current predictor configured to predict noise components<br>
present in the stator current. Subtracting the prediction of the noise components from<br>
repeatedly acquired real-time stator current yields fault components which are<br>
injected into the stator current by bearing failures/faults. It is envisioned that current<br>
predictor 32 can be configured as a Wiener filter (infinite impulse response (IIR) or<br>
fixed impulse response (FIR)), a steepest descent algorithm, a least mean square<br>
(LMS) algorithm, a least recursive squares (LRS) algorithm, or other digital filter.<br>
[0029] Referring now to Fig. 3, in an exemplary embodiment of the invention,<br>
processor 34 includes therein a Wiener filter 36 that provides for noise cancellation in<br>
the stator current and isolation of a fault signal therein. To provide accurate noise<br>
cancellation in the stator current, processor 34 is programmed to configure Wiener<br>
filter 36 to accurately define (i.e., estimate) most noise components in the stator<br>
current, such that the fault signal in the stator current is not included in its output. In<br>
configuring the Wiener filter 36, processor 34 analyzes stator current data associated<br>
with healthy bearing conditions. This stator current data associated with healthy<br>
bearing conditions can include a first set of stator current data that is acquired, for<br>
example, within a short period after the installation of a bearing or at the start of a<br>
bearing condition monitoring process, thus ensuring that no bearing fault component<br>
is included in the stator current. The first set of stator current data thus comprises<br>
baseline current data that essentially contains pure noise data that does not include<br>
fault information.<br>
The first set of stator current data, or baseline current data, is received by<br>
processor 34 and is implemented for configuring Wiener filter 36. More specifically,<br>
the baseline current data is used for assigning coefficients in the Wiener filter 36.<br>
Processor 34 assigns coefficients to the Wiener filter 36 such that the prediction error,<br>
e(n), of the filter is minimized in the mean-square sense. As shown in Fig. 3, the<br>
baseline current data is described by:<br>
<br>
where d1(n) is the noise components, d(n) is the fault signal, and vt(n) is the<br>
measurement noise. As set forth above, the baseline current data is devoid of a fault<br>
signal, and as such, Eqn. 1 reduces to. <br>
[0031] In configuring the Wiener filter 36, the processor 34 assigns the<br>
coefficients of the filter by using the minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) method.<br>
In implementing/applying the MMSE method, processor 34 solves for the<br>
coefficients, w(k),k=0, 1, ..., p, to minimize the mean square prediction error, 4-<br>
according to:<br>
<br>
where E{ } is the expected value, no is the delay of the input x(n), w(k),k = 0, 1.....p<br>
are the coefficients of the Wiener filter 36, andp is the order of the filter.<br>
|0032l The coefficients are found by setting the partial derivatives of 4 with<br>
respect to w(k) equal to zero, as follows:<br>
Eqn. 6 is thus simplified to:<br>
<br>
In matrix form, Eqn. 8 can be written as:<br>
<br>
or denoted by:<br>
<br>
[0035| The autocorrelation sequences in Eqn. 9 can be estimated by time averages<br>
when implementing this method. For finite data records (i.e., a finite number of stator<br>
current data points), x(n), 0
by:<br>
<br>
The matrix Rx is a symmetric Toeplitz matrix and can be solved efficiently by the<br>
Levinson-Durbin Recursion algorithm.<br>
[0036] As shown in Fig. 3, the output of Wiener filter 36 is a prediction, g(n), of<br>
the stator current, with the prediction error, e(n), of the filter being defined as the<br>
measured baseline current data, x(n), minus the predicted stator current g(n). As set<br>
forth above, the coefficients of the Wiener filter 36 are assigned such that the<br>
prediction error e(n) is minimized in the mean square sense (i.e., e(n) ~ 0). Thus, as<br>
the baseline current data is composed of essentially just a noise component, di(n) +<br>
vi(n). the predicted stator current g(n) should also be comprised of essentially just a<br>
noise component, forming a predicted noise component, d^(n) + v^(n), that can used<br>
be in continued real-time monitoring of the bearing condition for noise cancellation in<br>
repeatedly acquired stator current data and for identification of bearing fault signals.<br>
[0037) As set forth above, upon configuring of Wiener filter 36 (i.e., setting of the<br>
Wiener filter coefficients) from the previous samples of the stator current (i.e., the<br>
baseline current data), processor 34 is able to accurately detect bearing fault<br>
conditions in the motor system by estimating the noise components in additionally<br>
acquired stator current in real-time. As the dominant noise components (sinusoidal)<br>
in the stator current essentially do not change at constant loads, either in magnitude or<br>
in frequency, they can therefore be predicted in the most recent samples (i.e., real-<br>
time samples) of the stator current that is being monitored. Thus, in monitoring<br>
operation of the induction motor 12 (Fig. 1), additional sets of stator current data are<br>
acquired by sensors 22 and received by processor 34 for performing a stator current<br>
noise cancellation thereon. The additional sets of stator current data, are defined by:<br>
x(n) = di(n) + d(n) + v,(nj, [Eqn. 1 la],<br>
where d/(n) is the noise components, d(n) is the fault signal, and \&gt;i(n) is the<br>
measurement noise, as set forth above in Eqn. 1. As shown in Fig. 4, in monitoring<br>
current data from the inductor motor, the stator current is passed through input delay<br>
30, which provides a delay z of n0 samples and through Wiener filter 36, to cancel the<br>
estimated noise components di^(n )+ v^(n) therefrom and produce a noise-cancelled<br>
stator current. From Fig. 4, it can be seen that if the Wiener filter 36 has a good<br>
performance (i.e., d1^(n) + v1-'-(n) is close to d1(n) + vt(n)), the remaining part, y(n), of<br>
the stator current after noise cancellation (i.e., residual current data) will be the fault<br>
signal din). That is, when a bearing fault develops, the Wiener filter 36 predicts and<br>
cancels only the noise components in the stator current and keeps any remaining<br>
residual current data intact during the noise canceling process, from which fault<br>
components d(n) are identified. It is noted that the fault components d(n) are<br>
comprised of a plurality of fault characteristics from across a fault frequency<br>
spectrum. That is, a plurality of fault frequencies having a plurality of fault<br>
amplitudes comprise the fault components, and a collective effect of these frequencies<br>
and amplitudes are encompassed by the isolated fault components to facilitate the<br>
fault detection. As the frequencies of the fault signal and the magnitudes of the fault<br>
components are small for generalized roughness bearing faults, the summation of<br>
these factors in the collective fault component d(n) allows for increased fault signal<br>
strength and improved bearing fault detection.<br>
[0038] From the isolated fault components remaining in the noise-cancelled stator<br>
current, a fault index (i.e., fault indicator) is determined by processor 34. In an<br>
exemplary embodiment, the fault index is calculated as the root mean square (RMS)<br>
value of the noise-cancelled stator current. Taking the RMS value of the isolated fault<br>
components provides for a larger fault signal that can be monitored, allowing for<br>
improved recognition of bearing faults. Processor 34 is further programmed to<br>
analyze the fault index to determine if the fault index exceeds a threshold. If the fault<br>
index exceeds the threshold, then processor 34 generates an alert (i.e., audible or<br>
visual alert) to inform an operator that a fault component in the stator current has<br>
exceeded a desired amount. The operator can thus shut down operation of the motor<br>
at a convenient time to further assess the bearings. Alternatively, or in addition<br>
thereto, the fault information and its severity can also be communicated to a centralized<br>
monitoring system (not shown), such as a Computerized Maintenance Management System<br>
(CMMS) or distributed control system (DCS).<br>
[0039] 1 n an exemplary embodiment of the invention, a Statistical Process Control<br>
(SPC) technique is applied to analyze a plurality of fault indices and set a "threshold"<br>
based thereon. With respect to analyzing the fault components present in the stator<br>
current to detect generalized roughness bearing faults, it is difficult to relate these<br>
fault components in the stator current to the bearing fault severity. That is, the lack of<br>
equations available to describe fault signatures in stator current injected by<br>
generalized roughness bearing faults and the subtleness of bearing fault signatures in<br>
stator current makes it difficult to pre-define fault severity levels. As such, a SPC<br>
technique is applied to establish a warning threshold based on the statistics of the fault<br>
signal in the specific current monitoring process, rather than pre-setting a pre-defined,<br>
universal threshold for all applications. The SPC technique distinguishes abnormal<br>
changes in the noise-cancelled stator current (and resulting fault indices) that are<br>
caused by a bearing fault from ambient changes.<br>
Referring to Fig. 5, application of the SPC technique to the generated fault<br>
indices obtained via stator current noise cancellation is shown. Each fault index is<br>
plotted to an X chart 35, displaying individual fault index values 37, and a mR (i.e..<br>
"moving Range") chart 38 for monitoring differences 39 between the values of the<br>
fault indices. The individual measurements 37 are plotted on the X chart 35 and the<br>
differences 39 (i.e., moving range) are plotted on the mR chart 38. Based on the<br>
plotted values, upper and lower control limits 41, 43 are determined from the X chart<br>
and an upper control limit 45 is determined for the mR chart. For bearing fault<br>
detection, since the SPC is applied to noise-cancelled stator current, a fault index<br>
value falling below a lower control limit indicates a better bearing condition and,<br>
therefore, it is not of concern. As such, the upper control limit 41 of the X chart 35<br>
and/or the upper control limit 45 of the mR chart 38 comprise the relevant control<br>
limit (i.e., fault index warning threshold) for determining a threshold exceedance. In<br>
one embodiment, the upper control limits 41, 45 can be set at three standard<br>
deviations from the mean fault index value 47 and at three standard deviations from<br>
the mean difference value between adjacently acquired fault indices 49, respectively.<br>
[0041] Upon calculation of the control limits 41, 45 via the SPC technique, the<br>
fault indices are analyzed with respect to these control limits. Detection of an<br>
uncontrolled variation in the fault indices is indicative of a deteriorated bearing<br>
condition. That is, if the analyzed fault indices begin to frequently exceed the control<br>
limits 41, 45, such a variation is indicative of a deteriorated bearing condition (i.e.,<br>
incipient bearing fault). Thus, in determining whether a deteriorated bearing<br>
condition exists that necessitates generation of an alert, the percentage of fault indices<br>
exceeding the upper control limit 41, 45 is examined. If that percentage exceeds a<br>
pre-determined percentage, then it is determined that a deteriorated bearing condition<br>
exists and an alert is generated. For example, if the percentage of fault indices falling<br>
outside (i.e., exceeding) the control limits 41, 45 is above 10%, then an alert is<br>
generated. A SPC technique is thus utilized to monitor the fault indices obtained in<br>
real-time and analyze the fault index values to determine if a "threshold" has been<br>
exceeded, thus allowing for a determination that a deteriorated bearing condition or<br>
bearing fault exists.<br>
[0042] Referring now to Fig. 6, in another embodiment of the invention, the fault<br>
information d(n) in the stator current isolated by the noise cancellation technique of<br>
processor 40 can be viewed as the prediction error e(n) of a prediction error filter<br>
(PEF) 42. That is, when the bearing fault develops and the condition of the system<br>
changes, the prediction error increases. As shown in Fig. 6, if the noise cancellation<br>
system/technique is viewed as a PEF 42, then the system performance can be<br>
measured by the prediction error of the filter. That is, to have good performance, the<br>
prediction error should be significantly larger for a faulted bearing condition than for<br>
a healthy bearing condition. Consequently, the prediction error shown in Fig. 6 gets<br>
larger when the system enters a bearing fault condition from a healthy bearing<br>
condition.<br>
[0P43J In examining the PEF 42 to assess a prediction error, a general equation<br>
describing the prediction error can be given, along with specific equations for the<br>
filter performance for a healthy-bearing condition and for the filter performance<br>
having a bearing-fault condition. By definition, a general equation for the mean-<br>
square prediction error of the filter is:<br>
<br>
[0044) This is the same error as in Eqn. 2, which was minimized to find the<br>
coefficients of the Wiener filter. Upon expansion, the above equation can be<br>
rewritten as:<br>
<br>
[0045] Since the PEF 42 is designed to minimize the error in Eqn. 12 by using<br>
healthy bearing data, this prediction error is small for a healthy-bearing condition. In<br>
fact, for a healthy-bearing condition, since w(k), k=0,l,...,p , are solutions to Eqn. 8.<br>
the second term of the right hand side of Eqn. 13 is zero. Therefore, the prediction<br>
error for a healthy-bearing condition is:<br>
<br>
[0046] At such a condition, sincex(n)=di(n) +v/(n), therefore, it follows that:<br>
<br>
[0047] Since d,(n) and vj(nj are jointly wide sense stationary (WSS), Eqn. 15<br>
becomes:<br>
<br>
[0048] Since the measurement noise vj(n) is random, its power spectrum is<br>
distributed over a broad frequency range, its autocorrelation is pulse-like, and its<br>
cross-correlations with other signals are zero, (i.e., the autocorrelation sequences of a<br>
signal are the inverse Fourier transform of its power spectrum by definition). It thus<br>
follows from Eqn. 16 that:<br>
<br>
[0049] Substituting Eqn. 17 into Eqn. 14 yields:<br>
<br>
[0050] To further investigate the performance of the system, the noise components<br>
(including the supply fundamental and harmonics, the eccentricity harmonics, the slot<br>
harmonics, etc.) are described as:<br>
<br>
where Am, ?m, ?m, m=l, ..., M, are the amplitudes, the frequencies, and the angles of<br>
M noise components in the stator current. To compute the autocorrelation sequences<br>
of the signal d1(n), the following relationship is defined:<br>
<br>
[0^1] Eqn. 20 is then reduced by recognizing the following relationships:<br>
<br>
and<br>
<br>
[0052) Therefore, the autocorrelation sequences of the signal di(n) are:<br>
<br>
[0053] Substituting Eqn. 23 into Eqn. 18 yields the prediction error of the filter 42<br>
for a healthy-bearing condition as:<br>
<br>
[0054] Similarly, for a faulty bearing condition, the mean square prediction error<br>
can still be calculated from Eqn. 13. For convenience, Eqn. 13 is repeated here as:<br>
<br>
[0055] However, different from the situation of a healthy-bearing condition, the<br>
second term on the right hand side of Eqn. 25 for a faulty-bearing condition is not<br>
zero because of the presence of the fault signal in the stator current, which is<br>
x(n) =di (n) +d(n)+1v(n). It follows that:<br>
<br>
[0056] Assuming drfn), d(n), and vt(n) are jointly WSS, then Eqn. 26 becomes:<br>
<br>
[0057] As for a healthy-bearing condition, if it is assumed that the measurement<br>
noise vi(n) is a broadband signal and not correlated with di(n) and d(n), it then<br>
follows that:<br>
<br>
and that:<br>
<br>
[0058] If the noise components are described as:<br>
<br>
as set forth in Eqn. 19, then the fault components can be described as:<br>
<br>
where Aq, ?q, ?q, q=l, ..., Q, are the amplitudes, the frequencies, and the angles of Q<br>
fault components in the stator current injected by a bearing fault. The autocorrelation<br>
sequences of d(n) can thus be calculated as in Eqns. 20 to 23, with the result being:<br>
[0059)] For ?q ? ?m, q=l, 2, ..., Q, m=l, 2, ..., M, following the same steps as in<br>
Eqns. 20 to 23, the cross-correlation sequences between the noise components and the<br>
fault components become:<br>
<br>
[0060] Thus, combining Eqns. 25 to 32, the prediction error for a faulty-bearing<br>
condition can be obtained as:<br>
|Eqn. jjj,<br>
where £min is the prediction error for a healthy-bearing condition expressed in Eqn. 24.<br>
[0061] Beneficially, it is noted that the noise cancellation method set forth above<br>
considers a collective effect of the fault components to facilitate the fault detection.<br>
That is, as the frequencies of the fault signal, coq's, and the magnitudes of the fault<br>
components, Bq's, are small for generalized roughness bearing faults, summing these<br>
factors in the collective fault component d(nj, along with the bearing contact angle <pq.></pq.>
allows for increased fault signal strength and improved bearing fault detection. It is<br>
further noted that if the fault signal, d(nj, is a broadband signal, then it has the same<br>
effect as the broadband measurement noise v/(nj, and since the power of the<br>
broadband signal remains in the prediction error (both for a healthy-bearing condition<br>
and for a faulty-bearing condition), the presence of the fault signal results in an<br>
increase of the prediction error.<br>
[0062] Additionally, even if ?q = ?m and there is a smaller increase in the<br>
prediction error, (since the third term on the right hand side of Eqn. 33 is zero, while<br>
the second term is nonzero), fault information is still conserved in the resulting<br>
predictor error. That is, even if the fault components and the noise components have<br>
common frequencies, such as when the bearing fault augments the dynamic<br>
eccentricity of the motor, the fault information is still conserved in the resulting<br>
predictor error. The above features thus provide for an improved current-based<br>
sensing technique to detect generalized roughness bearing faults.<br>
[0063] Referring now to Fig. 7, a flow chart illustrating a current-based technique<br>
46 for detecting generalized roughness bearing faults is displayed. The technique<br>
begins by acquiring and receiving a first set of stator current data, x(n), from an<br>
electrical machine, such as a three-phase induction motor, to produce baseline current<br>
data 48. The first set of stator current data that is acquired/received is comprised of<br>
stator current data associated with healthy bearing conditions, which is known to be<br>
devoid of any bearing fault signal therein.<br>
[0064| From the baseline current data, a current data filter (i.e., noise cancellation<br>
system) is configured 50 to provide noise cancellation to the stator current, so as to<br>
isolate any fault component present therein. In an exemplary embodiment, the current<br>
data filter is a Wiener filter that is designed to cancel the noise component from the<br>
stator current based on a filtering of received stator current data by an estimation of<br>
the noise component in the stator current. To provide accurate noise cancellation in<br>
the stator current, the Wiener filter is configured such that it can accurately estimate<br>
most noise components in the stator current and such that the fault signal in the stator<br>
current is not included in its output. In configuring the Wiener filter, the baseline<br>
current data is used for assigning coefficients in the Wiener filter, such that no bearing<br>
fault information is embedded in the coefficients. The Wiener filter is designed such<br>
that a prediction error thereof is minimized in the mean square sense. That is, the<br>
coefficients are assigned using the minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) method.<br>
As the Wiener filter is configured based on the baseline current data (i.e., pure noise<br>
current data), this means that the output of the Wiener filter is a predicted noise<br>
component, g(n), of the stator current that is essentially equal to the baseline current<br>
data, such that the prediction error is minimized, i.e., e(n) = x(n)-g(n).<br>
[0065] After configuring of the Wiener filter, the technique continues by acquiring<br>
and receiving at least one additional set of stator current data 52. The additional stator<br>
current data is acquired/received after a period of use of the electrical machine and is<br>
monitored to detect bearing fault signals present in the stator current. The additional<br>
sets of stator current data are passed to the current data filter 54 to perform a noise<br>
component cancellation thereon. The estimated noise component provided by the<br>
current data filter is cancelled from the stator current 56 to isolate any fault<br>
component present in the stator current. That is, as the noise components (sinusoidal)<br>
in the stator current essentially do not change at constant loads, either in magnitude or<br>
in frequency, the predicted noise component output from the current data filter (and<br>
based on the baseline current data) can be cancelled from the most recent samples of<br>
the stator current (i.e., the additionally acquired stator current) to accurately determine<br>
a fault component in the stator current. Assuming that the current data filter was<br>
properly configured and has good performance, the remaining part of the stator<br>
current after noise cancellation will accurately portray the fault signal d(n).<br>
From the fault component remaining in the noise-cancelled stator current, a<br>
fault index (i.e., fault indicator) is determined 58. In an exemplary embodiment, the<br>
fault indicator is calculated as the RMS value of the noise-cancelled stator current.<br>
Taking the RMS value of the isolated fault component provides for a larger signal that<br>
can be monitored, allowing for improved recognition of bearing faults. Upon<br>
calculation, the fault index is compared to additionally calculated fault indices to<br>
generate a fault index threshold 59 and determine if the fault indicator exceeds that<br>
fault index threshold 60. If the fault indicator does not exceed the fault index<br>
threshold 62, then the technique proceeds by continuing to receive and monitor<br>
additional stator current data 64. If, however, the fault indicator does exceed the fault<br>
index threshold 66, then an alert is generated 68, such as an audible or visual alert, to<br>
inform an operator that a fault component in the stator current has exceeded a desired<br>
amount. The operator is thus allowed to shut down operation of the electrical<br>
machine to further examine the bearings for faults.<br>
[0067| In an exemplary embodiment of the technique 46, the fault index threshold<br>
is determined 59 via a Statistical Process Control (SPC) technique. The fault index<br>
threshold (i.e., control limit) is determined for each of an X chart and a mR (moving<br>
range) chart. Upon calculation of the fault index thresholds via the SPC technique,<br>
the fault indices are analyzed with respect to these thresholds 60. If a pre-determined<br>
amount or percentage of the fault indices fall outside the fault index thresholds 66, it<br>
is determined that a deteriorated bearing condition exists and an alert is generated 68.<br>
For example, if the percentage of fault indices falling outside the control limits is<br>
above 10%, then an alert can be generated. A SPC technique is thus utilized to<br>
monitor the fault indices obtained in real-time and analyze the fault index values to<br>
determine if a "threshold" has been exceeded, thus allowing for a determination that a<br>
deteriorated bearing condition or bearing fault exists.<br>
According to embodiments of the invention, the noise cancellation method<br>
set forth above is able to isolate fault components in the stator current to detect<br>
incipient bearing faults without the need for determining machine parameters, bearing<br>
dimensions, nameplate values, or stator current spectrum distributions. The analysis<br>
of the noise-cancelled stator current (and the fault indices generated therefrom) via the<br>
use of a SPC technique eliminates the need for knowledge of such machine<br>
parameters, bearing dimensions, nameplate values, or stator current spectrum<br>
distributions. That is, as the noise cancellation method determines control limits and<br>
fault index warning thresholds by way of a SPC technique based on acquired fault<br>
index values rather than on a set of pre-defined equations describing fault signatures<br>
in the stator current, such information is not needed for analysis of fault components<br>
in the stator current. As the determination/acquisition of machine parameters,<br>
bearing dimensions, nameplate values, or stator current spectrum distributions can be<br>
difficult and time consuming, the lack of a need for such information in embodiments<br>
of the system and method of the invention results in more efficient current-based<br>
bearing fault detection.<br>
[0069] A technical contribution for the disclosed method and apparatus is that it<br>
provides for a computer implemented technique for detecting impending mechanical<br>
motor faults by way of current noise cancellation. Current data is decomposed into a<br>
non-fault component (i.e., noise) and a fault component, and noise-cancellation is<br>
performed to isolate the fault component of the current and generate a fault index.<br>
[0070] Therefore, according to one embodiment of the present invention, a<br>
controller configured to detect indicia of incipient mechanical motor faults includes a<br>
processor programmed to receive a set of current data from a motor during known<br>
normal operation, define a baseline noise based on the set of current data acquired<br>
from the know normal operating motor, and repeatedly receive real-time operating<br>
current data from the operating motor. The processor is further programmed to<br>
remove the baseline noise from the operating current data to identify any fault<br>
components present in the operating current data and generate a fault index for the<br>
operating current data based on any isolated fault components.<br>
[0071] According to another embodiment of present invention, a non-invasive<br>
method for detecting impending bearing faults in electric machines includes the steps<br>
of acquiring a plurality of stator current data sets from the electric machine during<br>
operation, applying each of the plurality of stator current data sets to a current data<br>
filter in real-time to generate a noise-cancelled stator current, and determining a fault<br>
index from the noise-cancelled stator current for each of the plurality of stator current<br>
data sets. The method also includes the steps of monitoring a value of the fault index<br>
for the plurality of stator current data sets and generating an alert if the value of a pre-<br>
determined number of fault indices exceeds a control limit.<br>
[0072] According to yet another embodiment of the present invention, a system for<br>
monitoring current to predict bearing faults includes at least one non-invasive current<br>
sensor configured to acquire stator current data from an operating motor and a<br>
processor connected to receive the stator current data from the at least one non-<br>
invasive current sensor. The processor is programmed to receive a first set of stator<br>
current data from the at least one current sensor, the first set of stator current data<br>
comprising baseline current data representative of normal motor operation. The<br>
processor is also programmed to define a non-fault component from the baseline<br>
current data, repeatedly receive real-time operating current data from the operating<br>
motor, and remove the non-fault component from the operating current data in real-<br>
time to isolate residual current data. The processor is further programmed to process<br>
the residual current data to identify possible bearing faults; generate a fault index for<br>
any identified bearing faults and generate an alert if the fault index exceeds a fault<br>
index threshold.<br>
[0073] The present invention has been described in terms of the preferred<br>
embodiment, and it is recognized that equivalents, alternatives, and modifications,<br>
aside from those expressly stated, are possible and within the scope of the appending<br>
