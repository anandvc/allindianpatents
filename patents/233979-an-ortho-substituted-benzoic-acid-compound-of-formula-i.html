				<td>The       present       invention       relates        to        an        optionally        substituted (benzyl)(alkyl)aminooxoalkylphenoxymethylbenzoic acid of formula I.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
The Insulin Resistance Syndrome (IRS) including type 2 diabetes mellitus, which refers to a cluster of manifestations including insulin resistance with accompanying hypeiinsulinaemia, possible type 2 diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension, central (visceral) obesity, dyslipidaemia observed as deranged lipoprotein levels typically characterised by elevated VLDL (very low density lipoproteins), small dense LDL particles and reduced HDL (high density lipoprotein) concentrations and reduced fibrinolysis.<br>
Recent epidemiological research has documented that individuals with insulin resistance run a greatly increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, notably suffering from myocardial infarction and stroke. In type 2 diabetes mellitus atherosclerosis related, conditions cause up to 80% of all deaths.<br>
In clinical medicine there is awareness of the need to increase the insulin sensitivity in IRS suffering patients and thus to correct the dyslipidaemia which is considered to cause the accelerated progress of atherosclerosis. However, currently this is not a universally well defined disease.<br>
Modulators of peroxisome proliferator-activated. receptors (PPAR, for a review of the PPARs see T. M.Willson et al, J Med Chem 2000, Vol 43,527) are effective in treating conditions associated with insulin resistance.<br><br><br>
US 5,750,783 discloses that certain benzyloxy-substituted phenylglycinolamides which<br>
have a cycloalkyl substituent are antiatherosclerotic medicaments. This document does not<br>
disclose or suggest the compounds of the present invention.<br>
Surprisingly a series of compounds has now been found which are selective PPARa<br>
modulators.<br>
Description of the invention<br>
The present invention provides a compound of formula I<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
wherein n is 0, 1 or 2 and R1 represents halo, a Ci^alkyl group which is optionally substituted by one or more fluoro, a Q^alkoxy group which is optionally substituted by one or more fluoro and wherein when n is 2 the substituents R1 may be the same or different;<br>
R2 represents a<br>
group which is optionally interrupted by oxygen;<br>
Y is absent or represents methylene; and<br>
XisOorS;<br>
and pharmaceutically acceptable salts and prodrugs thereof.<br>
Further values of R1, R2, Y and X in compounds of Formula I now follow. It will be understood that such values may be used where appropriate with any of the definitions, claims or embodiments defined hereinbefore or hereinafter.<br>
In one aspect X is O.<br>
In a second aspect X is S.<br>
In a third aspect Y is methylene.<br>
In a fourth aspect Y is absent.<br>
In a fifth aspect R1 is halo, a Ci.4alkyl group or a C^alkoxy group and n is 0,1 or 2.<br>
Particularly R1 is fluoro, methoxy, or isopropyl when n is 1 or 2. Particularly n is 0.<br>
In a sixth aspect R2 represents a Cs-valkyl group .<br>
The term C2-salkyl denotes a straight-chain or branched saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon having from 2 to 8 carbon atoms. Examples of said alkyl include ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, iso-butyl, sec-butyl, t-butyl and straight- and branched-chain pentyl, hexyl, heptyl and octyl.<br>
It will be understood by those skilled in the art that the term interrupted as used above means that the oxygen atom is situated within the alkyl chain and is not the terminal atom. The term "prodrug " as used in this specification includes derivatives of the carboxylic acid group which are converted in a mammal, particularly a human, into the carboxylic acid group or a salt or conjugate thereof. It should be understood that, whilst not being bound by theory, it is believed that most of the activity associated with the prodrugs arises from the activity of the compound of formula I into which the prodrugs are converted. Prodrugs can be prepared by routine methodology well within the capabilities of someone skilled in the art. Various prodrugs of carboxy are known in the art. For examples of such prodrug derivatives, see:<br>
a)        Design of Prodrugs, edited by H. Bundgaard, (Elsevier, 1985) and Methods in Enzymology. 42; 309-396, edited by K. Widder, el al (Academic Press, 1985);<br>
b)        A Textbook of Drug Design and Development, edited by Krogsgaard-Larsen and H. Bundgaard, Chapter 5 "Design and Application of Prodrugs", by H. Bundgaard p.H3-191(1991);<br>

The above documents a to e are herein incorporated by reference.<br>
In vivo cleavable esters are just one type of prodrug of the parent molecule.<br>
The compounds of formula I have activity as medicaments, in particular the compounds of formula I are selective agonists of PPARcc, that is, their ECso for PPARa is at least three times lower, preferably at least four times lower and more preferably 10 or 50 times lower than their respective ECso for PPARy wherein the ECsoS are measured and calculated as described in the assays later in this document. The compounds of formula I are potent and selective.<br>

Pharmacological properties<br>
The present compounds of formula (I) are useful for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of clinical conditions associated with inherent or induced reduced sensitivity to insulin (insulin resistance) and associated metabolic disorders (also known as metabolic syndrome). These clinical conditions will include, but will not be limited to, general obesity, abdominal obesity, arterial hypertension, hyperinsulinaemia, hyperglycaemia, type<br>
11<br>
2 diabetes and the dyslipidaemia characteristically appearing with insulin resistance. This dyslipidaemia, also known as the atherogenic lipoprotein profile, is characterised by moderately elevated non-esterified fatty acids, elevated very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) triglyceride rich particles, high Apo B levels, low high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels associated with low apoAI particle levels and high Apo B levels in the presence of small, dense, low density lipoproteins (LDL) particles, phenotype B.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are expected to be useful in treating patients with combined or mixed hyperlipidemias or various degrees of hypertriglyceridemias and postprandial dyslipidemia with or without other manifestations of the metabolic syndrome.<br>
Treatment with the present compounds is expected to lower the cardiovascular morbidity and mortality associated with atherosclerosis due to their antidyslipidaemic as well as antimflammatory properties. The cardiovascular disease conditions include macro-angiopathies of various internal organs causing myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular disease and peripheral arterial insufficiency of the lower extremities. Because of their insulin sensitizing effect the compounds of formula I are also expected to prevent or delay the development of type 2 diabetes from the metabolic syndrome and diabetes of pregnancy. Therefore the development of long-term complications associated with chronic hyperglycaemia in diabetes mellitus such as the micro-angiopathies causing renal disease, retinal damage and peripheral vascular disease of the lower limbs are expected to be delayed. Furthermore the compounds may be useful in treatment of various conditions outside the cardiovascular system whether or not associated with insulin resistance, like polycystic ovarian syndrome, obesity, cancer and states of inflammatory disease including neurodegenerative disorders such as mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are expected to be useful in controlling glucose levels in patients suffering from type 2 diabetes.<br>
The present invention provides a method of treating or preventing dyslipidemias, the insulin resistance syndrome and/or metabolic disorders (as defined above) comprising the<br>
12<br>
administration of a compound of formula I to a mammal (particularly a human) in need thereof.<br>
The present invention provides a method of treating or preventing type 2 diabetes comprising the administration of an effective amount of a compound of formula I to a mammal (particularly a human) in need thereof.<br>
In a further aspect the present invention provides the use of a compound of formula I as a medicament.<br>
In a further aspect the present invention provides the use of a compound of formula I in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of insulin resistance and/or metabolic disorders.<br>
Combination Therapy<br>
The compounds of the invention may be combined with another therapeutic agent that is useful in the treatment of disorders associated with the development and progress of atherosclerosis such as hypertension, hyperlipidaemias, dyslipidaemias, diabetes and obesity. The compounds of the invention may be combined with another therapeutic agent that decreases the ratio of LDL:HDL or an agent that causes a decrease in circulating levels of LDL-cholesterol. In patients with diabetes mellitus the compounds of the invention may also be combined with therapeutic agents used to treat complications related to micro-angiopathies.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be used alongside other therapies for the treatment of metabolic syndrome or type 2 diabetes and its associated complications, these include biguanide drugs, for example metformin, phenformin and buformin, insulin (synthetic insulin analogues, amylin) and oral antihyperglycemics (these are divided into prandial glucose regulators and alpha-glucosidase inhibitors). An example of an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor is acarbose or voglibose or miglitol. An example of a prandial glucose regulator is repaglinide or nateglinide.<br>
13<br>
In another aspect of the invention, the compound of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, solvate of such a salt or a prodrug thereof, may be administered in association with another PPAR modulating agent. PPAR modulating agents include but are not limited to a PPAR alpha and/or gamma and /or delta agonist, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, solvates of such salts or prodrugs thereof. Suitable PPAR alpha and/or gamma agonists, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, solvates of such salts or prodrugs thereof are well known in the art. These include the compounds described in WO 01/12187, WO 01/12612, WO 99/62870, WO 99/62872, WO 99/62871, WO 98/57941, WO 01/40170, J Med Chem, 1996, 39, 665, Expert Opinion on Therapeutic Patents, 10 (5), 623-634 (in particular the compounds described in the patent applications listed on page 634) and J Med Chem, 2000, 43, 527 which are all incorporated herein by reference. Particularly a PPAR alpha and/or gamma agonist refers to BMS 298585, clofibrate, fenofibrate, bezafibrate, gemfibrozil and ciprofibrate; GW 9578, pioglitazone, rosiglitazone, rivoglitazone, balaglitazone, KRP-297, JTT-501, SB 213068, GW 1929, GW 7845, GW 0207, L-796449, L-165041 and GW 2433. Particularly a PPAR alpha and/or gamma agonist refers to (S)-2-ethoxy-3-[4-(2-{4-methanesulphonyloxy-phenyl}ethoxy)phenyl]propanoic acid and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.<br>

Example 15<br>
2-{[(4-{2-[(4~Chlorobenzyl)(ethyl)amino]-2-oxoethyl}phenyl)thio]methyl}benzoic acid. Biological activity Formulations<br>
Compounds were dissolved in DMSO to obtain 16 mM stock solutions. Before assays, stock solutions were further diluted in DMSO and culture media.<br>
GENERAL CHEMICALS AND REAGENTS<br>
Luciferase assay reagent was purchased from Packard, USA. Restriction Enzymes were<br>
from Boehringer and Vent polymerase from New England Biolabs.<br>
CELL LINES AND CELL CULTURE CONDITIONS<br>
U2-OS, (Osteogenic sarcoma, Human) was purchased from ATCC, USA. Cells were expanded and refrozen in batches from passage number six. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) with 25 mM glucose, 2 mM glutamine or 4 mM L-alanyl-L-glutamine,10% fetal calf serum, at 5% C02. Phosphate buffered saline<br>
49<br>
(PBS) without addition of calcium or magnesium was used. All cell culture reagents were from Gibco (USA) and 96-well cell culture plates were purchased from Wallach.<br>
PLASME) CONSTRUCTS FOR HETEROLOGOUS EXPRESSION<br>
Standard recombinant DNA techniques were carried out as described by Ausubel (7). The Luciferase reporter vector, pGLSUAS (clone consists of five copies of the GAL4 DNA binding sequence, 5'-CGACGGAGTACTGTCCTCCGAGCT-3', cloned into the SacI/XhoI sites of pGL3-Promoter (Promega). The Sacl/XhoI fragment carrying the UAS sites was constructed using annealed overlapping oligonucleotides.<br>
Expression vectors used are based upon pSG5 (Stratagene). All vectors contain an EcoRI/Nhel fragment encoding the DNA binding domain of GAL4 (encoding amino acid positions 1-145 of database accession number P04386) followed by an in-frame fusion to a fragment encoding the nuclear localisation sequence from T antigen of Polyoma Virus. The nuclear localisation sequence was constructed using annealed overlapping oligonucleotides creating Nhel/Kpnl sticky ends<br>
(5'-CTAGCGCTCCTAGAAGAAACGCAAGGTTGGTAC-3'). The ligand binding domains from human and mouse PPARcc and human and mouse PPARy were PCR amplified as KpnI/BamHI fragments and cloned in frame to the GAL4 DNA binding domain and the nuclear localisation sequence. The sequence of all plasmid constructs used were confirmed by sequencing. The following expression vectors were used for transient transfections:<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
1     refers to nucleotide positions of data base entry used to express the ligand binding domain.<br>
TRANSIENT TRANSFECTIONS<br>
Frozen stocks of cells from passage number six were thawed and expanded to passage number eight before transfections. Confluent cells were trypsinised, washed and pelleted by centrifugation at 270xg for 2 minutes. The cell pellet was resuspended in cold PBS to a cell concentration of about 18 x 106 cells/ml. After addition of DNA, the cell suspension was incubated on ice for approximately 5 minutes before electroporation at 230 V, 960 /uF in Biorad's Gene Pulser™ in 0.5 ml batches. A total of 50 /ig DNA was added to each batch of 0.5 ml cells, including 2.5 jig expression vector, 25 /xg reporter vector and 22.5 /xg unspecific DNA (pBluescript, Stratagene).<br>
After electroporation, cells were diluted to a concentration of 320'000 cells/ml in DMEM without phenol red, and approximately 25'000 cells/well were seeded in 96-well plates. In order to allow cells to recover, seeded plates were incubated at 37°C for 3-4 hours before addition of test compounds. In assays for PPARa, the cell medium was supplemented with resin-charcoal stripped fetal calf serum (PCS) in order to avoid background activation by fatty acid components of the PCS. The resin-charcoal stripped PCS was produced as follows; for 500 ml of heat-inactivated PCS, 10 g charcoal and 25 g Bio-Rad Analytical Grade Anion Exchange Resin 200-400 mesh were added, and the solution was kept on a magnetic stirrer at room temperature over night. The following day, the PCS was centrifuged and the stripping procedure was repeated for 4-6 hours. After the second treatment, the PCS was centrifuged and filter sterilised in order to remove remnants of charcoal and resin.<br>

ASSAY PROCEDURE<br>
Stock solutions of compounds in DMSO were diluted in appropriate concentration ranges in master plates. From master plates, compounds were diluted in culture media to obtain test compound solutions for final doses.<br>
After adjustment of the amount of cell medium to 75 fil in each well, 50 /il test compound solution was added. Transiently transfected cells were exposed to compounds for about 24 hours before the luciferase detection assay was performed. For luciferase assays, 100 /il of assay reagent was added manually to each well and plates were left Tor approximately 20 minutes in order to allow lysis of the cells. After lysis, luciferase activity was measured in a 1420 Multiwell counter, Victor, from Wallach.<br>
Reference compounds<br>
The TZD pioglitazone was used as reference substance for activation of both human and murine PPARy. 5,8,11,14-Eicosatetrayonic acid (ETYA) was used as reference substance for human PPARa.<br>
Calculations and analysis<br>
For calculation of EC5Q values, a concentration-effect curve was established. Values used were derived from the average of two or three independent measurements (after subtraction of the background average value) and were expressed as the percentage of the maximal activation obtained by the reference compound. Values were plotted against the logarithm of the test compound concentration. EC5Q values were estimated by linear intercalation between the data points and calculating the concentration required to achieve 50% of the maximal activation obtained by the reference compound.<br>
The compounds of formula I have an ECso of less than 50umol/l for PPARa and preferred compounds have an ECso of less than 5nmol/l. For example the EC50s of some of the Examples for human PPAR alpha are:<br>
