				<td> <br><br>
The invention pertains to a coating composition comprising a silicon heterocyclic compound and a hydroxyl-reactive cross-linker, to a process for curing the composition, and to the use of the composition.<br>
Such a composition is known from British Patent GB 1208907. This publication describes two-component polyurethane compositions comprising a poiyurethane prepolymer with residual Isocyanate groups and a pentacoordinate silicon complex. The silicon complex is charged and comprises a cation formed from an amine as counter-ion. Upon heating the composition to 177°C the amine is released from the silicon complex and the amine causes the isocyanate-functional prepolymer to cure.<br>
This composition has several drawbacks. Firstly, the pentacoordinate silicon complex is a crystalline solid of poor solubility in organic solvents and in the polyurethane prepolymer. Therefore", these compositions are not suitable for the preparation of a coating composition haying a low content of volatile organic solvents in order to comply with current and future environmental legislation. A second disadvantage of the composition disclosed in GB 1208907 lies in its curing temperature of 177°C. Such a high curing temperature undesirably limits the possible application areas of the composition. Thus, the composition is not suitable for the (re)finishing of cars, large transportation vehicles, airplanes, nor for substrates which would not withstand a high curing temperature, e.g., plastic orwood.<br>
Thirdly, the silicon complex setves merely as a blocking agent for the amtie which causes the isocyanate-functional prepolymer to cure. Thus the part of the pentacoordinate silicon complex remaining after release of the amine will not form part of the cross-linked network to be formed. Rather, it will remain embedded as a low-molecular weight compound in the polymer matrix. This will detract from the properties of the cross-linked polymer and  additionally<br><br>
encompasses the risk of release of. the low-molecular weight co'm'pound to the environment during curing or use.<br>
' The invention now provides a coating composition of the aforennentioned type which is not restricted by the above-mentioned drawbacks. The coating composition of the current invention comprises a compound comprising at least one spiro-ortho silicate group (hereinafter spiro-prtho silicate will be abbreviated to SOS) and a hydroxyi-reactive cross-linker.<br>
It should be noted that German Patent Application DE 198 07 504-A discloses a process for the surface cross-linking of super-absorbing polymer particles, wherein SOS group-comprising compounds are used as cross-linkers. Cross-linking occurs by transesterification at elevated temperature, preferably at 120'C to 220°C. The surface-cross-linked super-absorbing polymer particles are reported to possess an increased water retention capability. Coating compositions are not disclosed in this publication.<br>
SOS group-comprising compounds comprise a tetravalent silicon atom. Such compounds generally have a good solubility in organic solvents and are miscible with hydroxyi-reactive cross-linkers. In many cases SOS group-comprising compounds are low-viscous liquids. Therefore, the coating composition of the current invention can be formulated to a coating composition having a low content of volatile organic solvents. It is also within the scope of the current invention to formulate a coating composition free of volatile organic solvents.<br>
The coating composition of. the current invention can be cured at a lower temperature than the composition disclosed in GB 1208907, for example at a temperature as low as 5C.<br><br>
The coating composition of the current invention is a composition having fatent hydroxy! groups. In the presence of water or moisture from the air the SOS groups wiil be hydrolyzed, forming alcoholic hydroxy! groups and silanol groups. It has been found that when a hydroxyl-reactive cross-linker, i.e. a compound comprising at least two hydroxyl-reactive groups, is present in the coating composition, the deblocl<ed alcoholic hydroxy groups can react with the hydroxyl-reactive to give a cross-linked polymer. additionally silanol formed participate in reaction cross-linker or one another condensation both. thus . cured coating composition of current invention is essentially free unreacted low-molecular weight blocking agents which might be released environment during curing use.></ed>
Further, because of the stability of the SOS group-comprising compounds in the absence of moisture the pot life : drying time ratio of coating compositions according to the invention is particularly favourable, because hydrolysis of the SOS group only takes place in the presence of water or moisture. The coating films prepared from the coating composition according to the invention also exhibit an excellent car wash resistance, i.e. resistance to damage and/or loss of gloss as a consequence of car wash treatment.<br>
SOS group-comprising compounds can be used as main binders or as reactive<br>
diluents in the coating composition of the present invention.<br>
SOS groups can be represented by a structure according to formula (1)<br><br>
v/herein X and Y may be the same or different and represent the residue of a linear or branched polyol. Preferably, the polyol is a diol having 2 to 80 carbon<br><br>
■ .atoms, preferably having 2 to 20 carbon atoms, and most preferably having 2 to 10 carbon atoms. Suitable diols are p,z-diols, v/herein z-p is an integer from 1 to 17. Said p,2-diols may optionally contain one or more hetero-atoms from the group of oxygen, nitrogen, sulphur, and phosphorus, and/or one or more groups selected from the group of amide, thioamide, thioester, urethane, urea, sulphone, sulphoxy, ether, ester, and olefinic unsaturation. The p,2-diols may optionally be substituted with one or more groups selected from epoxy, cyano, halogen, amino, thiol, hydroxyl, nitro, phosphorus, sulphoxy, amido, ether, ester, urea, urethane, thioester, thioamide, amide, carboxyl, carbonyl, aryl, acyi, and olefinically unsaturated groups.<br>
It is also within the scope of the invention that either or both of X and Y form part of or have links to a polymer or oligomer structure.<br>
The present SOS group-comprising compounds are known as such and can be prepared in several ways.<br>
One such way is the reaction of a diol and a suitable silicon derivative such as a tetraalkyl orthosilicate or a silicon tetrahalide. Such reactions are described by C.L. Frye in Journal of Organic Chemistry 34 (1968), pp. 2496 - 2499. Suitable diols for this reaction are as described above.<br>
An alternative preparation of SOS group-comprising compounds is described by Wongkasemijt et al. in Tetrahedron 57 (2001), pp. 3997 - 4003. This publication describes the direct synthesis of SOS group-comprising compounds from fumed silica and 1,2-diols or 1,3-diois.<br>
SOS group-comprising compounds wherein X and Y represent the residues of •  • p,z-dio!s wherein z-p is in the range of 1 to 14 are preferred, more preferably z-p is in the range of 1 to 5, Examples of such preferred p,z-diols are diols wherein z-p is 1, such as ethylene glycol, 1,2-propanediol, 1,2-butanediol, 2,3-butanediol,   1,2-hexanediol,   2,3-dimethyl-2,3-butanediol.

monoethers, and pentaerythritoi diethers.<br>
Also   suitable   are   trimethyloipropane,   pentaerythritoi,   and   pentaerythritoi<br>

The invention further encompasses a-process for curing the present coating composition. iVIore particularly, the latent alcoholic hydroxyl groups and the silanol groups of the SOS-functional compound have to be deblocked. The alcoholic hydroxyl groups are reacted with the hydroxyi-reactive groups of the hydroxyi-reactive cross-linker. The silanol groups formed can either participate in the reaction with the hydroxyi-reactive cross-linker or react with one another in a condensation reaction to allow the present composition to be cured.<br>
The deblocking of the latent alcoholic hydroxyl groups and of the silanol groups of SOS group-comprising compound takes place under the influence of water in the form of, e.g., moisture from the air or added water. Said deblocking reactions can be accelerated by the presence of a suitable deblocking catalyst, for example by an acid or. a,base. Preferably, the deblocking catalyst is selected from Lewis acids, Lewis bases, and BrGnstedt bases. Examples of suitable catalysts are dibutyl tin dilaurate, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.23octane, and 1,8-diazabicycto[4.5.0]undec-7-ene. The deblocking catalyst may be used in an amount of 0 to 10 vrt.%, preferably 0.001 to 5 wt.%. more nrpfpraWu in ^^<br><br>

I ' !<nown to the skilled person. cross-linking catalyst may be used in an amount of preferably wt. more calculated on solid matter sos group-comprising compound hydroxyl-reactive and optionally above-mentioned other compounds></nown>
As an example of the various hydroxyl-reactive groups the following cross-linking catalysts may be mentioned, Polyisocyanates: dimethyl tin dilaurate, dibutyl tin dilaurate, dibutyl tin diacetate, tin octoate, dimethyl tin dichloride, zinc octoate, aluminium chelate, and catalysts based on zirconium or bismuth; polyepoxy compounds: tertiary amines and Lewis acids such as BF3 or organic complexes thereof; polyacetal compounds: paratoluene sulphonic acid and dodecy! benzene sulphonic acid; polycarboxylic acid compounds: dodecyl benzene sulphonic acid, polyanhydride compounds, and carboxylic acid ester compounds; organotin compounds, organic titanium compounds, acids, and bases; alkoxysilane compounds: organotin compounds, phosphoric acid, paratoluene sulphonic acid, dodecyl benzene sulphonic acid, and tertiary amines; Michael acceptor groups: strong acids and bases, e.g. alkali metal alcoholates, tertiary amines; and etherified amino groups: dodecyl benzene sulphonic acid.<br><br>
It should be noted that in certain cases said deblocking catalyst and said cross-linking catalyst may be identical, i.e. one catalyst can catalyze both the deblocking of the SOS group-comprising compound and the above-mentioned cross-linking reactions.<br>
Due to the excellent pot life of the coating composition according to the invention, it can be formulated as a one-component system. Alternatively, the coating composition according to the invention can be part of a multi-component system, for instance a two-component system. For example, one component can comprise both the SOS group-comprising compound and the hydroxyl-reactive compound. The second component can comprise the deblocking catalyst for the hydrolysis of the SOS group-comprising compound.<br>
Alternatively, a three-component system can be employed. For example, one component can comprise the SOS .group-comprising compound. A second component can comprise the hydroxyl-reactive component. A third component can comprise the deblocking catalyst for the hydrolysis of the SOS-functional compound.<br>
The coating composition can additionally comprise the usual additives such as solvents, pigments, fillers, leveling agents, emulsifiers, anti-foaming agents and rheology control agents, reducing agents, antioxidants, HALS-stabilizers, UV-stabilizers, water traps such as molecular sieves, and anti-settling agents.<br>
It is preferred that the coating composition according to the invention comprises less than 480 g/l of volatile organic compounds (VOC), more preferably the coating composition comprises less than 250 g/l of VOC.<br>
Application of the coating composition onto a substrate can be via any method known to the skilled person, e.g., via rolling, spraying, brushing, flow coating.<br><br>
dipping, and roller coating. Preferably, a coatrng composition such as described Is applied by spraying.<br>
The coating composition of the present invention can be applied to any substrate. The substrate may be, for example, metal, e.g., iron, steel, and aluminium, plastic, wood, glass, synthetic material, paper, leather, or another coating layer. The other coating layer can be comprised of the coating composition of the current invention or it can be a different coating composition. The coating compositions of the current invention show particular utility as clear coats (over base coats, water borne and solvent borne), base coats, pigmented top coats, primers, and fillers. The compositions are suitable for coating objects such as bridges, pipelines, industrial plants or buildings, oil and gas installations, or ships. The compositions are particularly suitable for finishing and refinishing automobiles and large transportation vehicles, such as trains, trucks, buses, and airplanes.<br>
The applied coating composition can be cured very effectively at a temperature of, e.g., 0-60°C. If so desired, the coating composition may be oven cured.'e.g. at a temperature in the range of 60-120°C.<br>
It is to be understood that the term coating composition as used herein also includes its use as adhesive composition.<br>
The invention will be elucidated further with reference to the following examples.<br>
in the examples the following abbreviations are used:<br>
Dibutyl tin dilaurate	: DBTDL<br>
1,4-Diazabicyclo[2.2.2loctane	: DABCO<br>
1,8-Dia2abicycio[4.5.0]undec-7-ene       : DBU<br><br>
n-Butylacetate	: BuAc<br>
Isopropylalcohol	: IPA<br>
Xylene	: Xy<br>
2-Butanone	'	: MEK<br>
Tetraethyl orthosilicate	: TEOS<br>
In the examples the following materials are used:<br>
Tolonate®  HDT  LV is the cyclic isocyanurate trimer of  hexamethylene<br>
diisocyanate, ex Rhcdia.<br>
Byk® 331 is a surface additive, ex Byk Chemie.<br>
A commerical .two-component clear coat based on a hydroxyi-furictional binder<br>
and a polyisocyanate.<br>
Unless otherwise stated, the properties of the coating compositions and the<br>
resulting films were measured as follows:<br>
The pot life was defined as the time period wherein the viscosity of the coating ' composition after initial mixing of ail compounds is doubled.<br>
The drying time is the time until the coating is touch dry. Drying was evaluated<br>
manually. The touch dry drying state is achieved when a mark in the coating<br>
layer from firm pushing with the thumb disappears within 1-2 minutes.<br>
The solvent resistance was determined by 1-minute exposure of the film to a<br>
cotton wool wad soaked with MEK. The solvent resistance was evaluated<br>
visually on a scale from 0 to 5, wherein 0 means dissolution of the film and 5<br>
means no damage.<br>
The Persoz hardness was determined according to IS01522.<br>
The appearance was determined visually. When there were no visual defects in<br>
the coating layer, the appearance was judged to be ok. When blisters were<br>
present, the appearance was judged 'to be not ok (nok).<br>
For determination of the car wash resistance first the initial gloss of a coated<br>
panel was measured. The coated panel was subjected to 10 minutes brushing<br>
with a circular nylon brush having a diameter of 64 cm, rotating with 150<br><br>
revolutions per minute. During brusliing, the coated panel was moistened with an aqueous solution of sodium dodecylsulfate containing aluminum oxide particles as abrasive. After brushing, the panel was rinsed with water and dried. After two hours the gloss was measured to determine the gloss after car wash treatment. Subsequently, the panels were heated to 60°C for 30 minutes and stored at room temperature for six days, whereupon the gloss was measured again to determine the gloss after reflow. A lower decrease of gloss after the car wash treatment indicates a better car wash resistance of the coated panels. All gloss measurements were carried out in accordance with ISO 2813 at an angle of 20°, the result being indicated in gloss units.<br>
Preparation of 2-butvl-2-ethvl-1.3-propanediol spiro-orthosilicate fSOS 1&gt; A 11 4-necked flask was filled with 320 g 2-buty!-2-ethy!-1,3-propanediol (2 moles), 100 g xylene, and 208 g TEOS (1 mole). 0.1 g sodium was dissolved in 5 ml ethanol and added to the reaction mixture. The flask was heated to QOX. Ethanol was distilled from the reaction mixture using a 30 cm packed column. The reaction mixture was gradually heated to 180°C until all the ethanol was removed. The xylene was removed by using vacuum distillation (10 mbar). The packed column was replaced by a 30 cm Vigreaux column. The vacuum was increased to 0.4 mbar and the reaction mixture was heated to 195°C. The product distilled from the reaction mixture (bp = 166°C, 0.4 mbar). 309 g 2-butyl-2-ethyl-1,3-propanediol spiro-orthosilicate was obtained (91% yield).<br>
Preparation of 2-ethvi-1.3-hexanediol spiro-orthosilicate (SOS 2) A II 4-necked flask was filled with 235 g 2-ethyl-1,3-hexanediol (1.6 moles), 80 g xylene, and 167 g TEOS (0.8 moles). 0.1 g sodium was dissolved in 4 ml ethanol and added to the reaction mixture. The flask was heated to 90X. Ethanol was distilled from the reaction mixture using a 30 cm packed column. The reaction mixture was gradually heated to 200'*C until all the ethanol was removed. The reaction mixture was cooled to ISO'C and the xylene was<br><br>
removed by using vacuum, distillafion (20 mbar). The'packed column was replaced by a 30 cm Vigreaux column. The vacuum was increased to 0.1 mbar and the reaction mixture was heated to 158°C. The product distilled from the reaction mixture (bp = 126'C, 0.1 mbar), 250 g 2-ethyl-1,3-hexanedio! splro-orthosilicate was obtained (98% yield).<br>
Preparation of trimethvlolpropane mono allvl ether spiro-orthosilicate (SOS 3) A 500 ml 4-necked flask was filled with 200 g trimethylolpropane mono allyl ether (1.2 moles) and 123 g TEOS (0.6 moles). 0.1 g sodium was dissolved in 4 ml methanol and added to the reaction mixture. The flask was heated to 90°C. Ethanol was distilled from the reaction mixture using a 30 cm packed column. The reaction mixture was gradually heated to 260°C until all the ethanol was removed. The packed column was replaced by a 30 cm Vigreaux column. The vacuum was increased to 0.2 mbar and the reaction mixture was heated to 185X. The product distilled from the reaction mixture (bp = 16rC, 0.2 mbar). 72.4 g Trimethylolpropane mono allyl ether spiro-orthosilicate was obtained (33% yield).<br>
Coating compositions 1 -10 and comparative coating composition 11 The preparation of coating compositions 1 to 10 according to the invention is summarized in Table 1. Composition 11 is a comparative composition without SOS. Table 1 reports the components and their amounts in parts by weight. The components were added in the order of listing in the t^ble and were mixed manually by stirring with a spatula.<br>
All formulations 1 - 10 of Table 1 had an approximate starting viscosity of 110 mPas at a theoretical solids contents of about 82 - 87 wt.%. Comparative composition 11 had a viscosity of 220 mPas at a theoretical solids content of 85 wt.%. Thus, in order to achieve the same viscdsity, comparative composition 9 requires a higher organic solvent content than the compositions according to the invention.<br><br>
The coating compositions were applied to tin plates in a layer thickness or approximately 60 μ w with a hand draw bar and dried at room temperature or at<br>
60c.<br>
For sprayabie coating compositions the compositions 1 •- 10 were diluted with a 1:1 mixture of BuAc/Xy to a viscosity of 55 mPas, leading to a theoretical solids content of about 79 wt.%. This corresponds to a volatile organic content of less than 250 g/1.<br>
It can be concluded that all coating compositions 1-11 of Table 1 have an excellent pot life of more than 7 days.<br>
From Table .2„DQe can conclude that all coating compositions 1-10 have a short drying time when cured at SO'C. The drying speed can be increased by the presence of a deblocking catalyst. The solvent resistance, hardness, and appearance of all catalyzed coatings are excellent. Comparative-composition 11 has a relatively long drying time and an insufficient appearance due to the ' formation of blisters.<br>
Table 3 summarizes the film properties of coating compositions 1 - 10 and comparative composition 11 cured at room temperature. The differences . between the drying times of the coating compositions with or without a deblocking catalyst become more pronounced. However, even coating compositions 1 and 2 without a deblocking catalyst exhibit high hardness after 8 days of curing at room temperature. Comparative composition 11 dries slower than the coating compositions according to the invention. All fully cured films of coating compositions 1-10 exhibit no damage after immersion in water for 4 - 6 hours.<br>
The films prepared from coating composition 2 were also subjected to' the car wash resistance test as described above. Table 4 gives an overview of the results in comparison with a commercial two-component clear coat based on a hydroxyi-functional binder and a polyisocyanate. Table 4 shows that the initial gloss, the gloss after car wash, and the gloss after reflow of films formed from the coating composition according to the invention are higher than the gloss of<br><br>
the commercial system. More importantly, it can be concluded that the films from the coating composition according to the invention exhibit a lower decrease of gloss after car wash treatment than the commercial system. Thus, the coating films according to the invention have an improved car wash resistance.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
