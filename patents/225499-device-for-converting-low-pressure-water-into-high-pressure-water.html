FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a device for converting low pressure water into high pressure water by using energy of incoming and outgoing water from converter.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
The available water pressure converters or intensifiers or pumps which work without electricity or fuel are less efficient, as well as those must be installed at lowest level to get low pressure water form the supply as a working fluid. Hence they are not convenient to pump water easily, for agriculture &amp; public water supply.<br>
These problems are overcome by this invention; it converts low pressure water into high pressure water, by using energy of water at low pressure. The water pressure converter acts as a triple acting reciprocating pump, uses the energy of incoming water from supply and out going water from converter. During the conversion, water get exhausted, stored and pumped at the same time, which is the triple action.<br>
The water pressure converter consists of three fixed co-axial cylinders (two closed at one end and one closed at both end), two discs and two rings coupled together by rods, acts as triple acting piston, two three way valves and four one way valves. The triple acting piston slides in fixed cylinders, as the pressure exerted by outgoing (exhaust) and incoming water (from reservoir or supply) , causes increase in pressure of water body in one of the cylinder which are either sides of triple acting piston. The process repeats automatically as piston guides three way valves accordingly and automatically. Three way valve remains in stable position during the movement of piston, at the end of every stroke the stable position of three<br>
2<br><br><br>
way valves changes from first position to second and second to first. This causes water to flow in and out alternately from fixed cylinders and high pressure water to flow out from one of the inner body of the piston.<br>
The high pressure obtained depends on the ratio of surface area of disc to the cross section area of inner fixed cylinder.<br>
Converter uses the energy of outgoing as well as incoming water; it can be installed at any level (below, same or above) with respect to the reservoir or supply water level.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG.l  is a schematic of first fixed positions of three way valves and movement of triple acting piston towards left for pumping fluid (first stroke).<br>

'2' allows water flow only from supply to said first side of triple acting piston through pipe '9', valve '3' is connected to pipe '9' which is further connected to output pipe '6' at which high pressure water is obtained. Valve '3' allows the high pressure water to flow out of said first side (volume between ring '17' and disc '14') of said triple acting piston. The valve '4' is connected between pipe ' 1' and pipe '8', valve '4' allows low pressure water from supply to flow to the said second side(vo!ume between ring '16' and disc '15') of triple acting piston. The valve '5' is connected to pipe '8' which allows high pressure water to flow from said second side of triple acting piston to output pipe *6\ The valve '35' is a two way valve connected to pipe' 1' (ON and OFF position type), which allows or stops the water from input supply in operation.<br>
A pipe '9' is connected to one way valve '2' and '3' and connected to the first side of triple acting piston through a bore '47' and '46', exists the communication between water in the said first side of the triple acting piston and output or input water via one way valve '3' or one way valve '2' respectively, a water-tight sea! of any well known construction is provided between pipe '9' and bores '46' and '47'<br>
A pipe '8' is connected to one way valve '4' and '5' and passes to the said second side of the triple acting piston through bore '48' and '45' can exist the communication between water in the second side of triple acting piston and output or input water via one way valve '5' or '4' respectively. A water-tight seal of any well known construction is provided between pipe '8' and bores'48'and'45'<br>
A pipe '6' is an output pipe from which high pressure water is obtained. A pipe '1' is the pipe which exists the communication between water pressure converter and input water supply. A pipe '30' is a pipe which<br>
5<br>
-13 OCT 2008<br><br>
exists communication between water pressure converter and exhaust water. The lower end of the pipe '30' is kept in exhaust water to maintain water column inside it, a pipe '38' is connected to cylinder '13' through bore '43' and pipe '39' is connected to cylinder '12'through bore '44'. The water-tight seal of any well known construction is provided between pipe '38','39' and bores '43', '44' respectively.<br>
The small slidable rings '22', '23'and '24' and *25' are fixed on the linking rods '20' and '21' respectively. At the end of each stroke of the triple acting piston the rings '22','23' and '24', '25' actuate the leavers '32','33' of three way valves '7' and '29' respectively. The stroke length is adjusted by adjusting position of rings *22', '23' and '24','25' on respective rods'20' and '21'.<br>
The three way valve '29'is having one outlet, two inlet and lever '33'. The outlet of three way valve '29' is connected to exhaust pipe '30', first inlet of valve '29' is connected to pipe '26' and second inlet is connected to pipe '27'<br>
The three way valve '7' is having one inlet and two outlets and an operating lever '32'.Leavers '32' and '33' are movable between the first position and second position. The inlet of valve '7' is connected to pipe '1' which carries the water from supply, first outlet is connected to pipe'lO'which is connected to fixed cylinder '13' via pipe '38' and also connected to pipe '27'. Second outlet of valve '7 is connected to pipe 'll'which is connected to cylinder '12' via pipe '39'and also connected to pipe '26'.<br>
In operation, initially while using converter for first time and when it is located below water supply level, the air from all cylinders, all pipes is removed and it is replaced by water by known art. The lower end of exhaust<br>
6<br>
13 OCT 2008<br><br>
pipe '30' is kept in exhaust water and closed temporary to maintain water column in it. Three way valves '7' and '29' are operated manually to allow the water to flow from reservoir to converter and further to exhaust, after removal of air from all inner parts of converter and pipes lowest end of exhaust pipe is opened.<br>
When it is located above the water supply level, air is removed by closing end of input pipe ' 1' kept in reservoir or supply and end of exhaust pipe '30' temporary and water is filled with the help of external source of water by well known methods.<br>
At the start of the pumping cycle the said triple acting piston assembly is at its rightmost position, also the rings '22','23' and '24','25' are at their rightmost position, by placing the levers '32'and '33' in their first positions water communication exist between cylinder '12' and input supply water from reservoir, through pipes '39', '11' and '1' via three way valve'7'. Also water exist communication between water inside cylinder '13'and exhaust water through pipe '38', '27' and '30'via three way valves '29'. Thus water from inlet is directed in cylinder '12' through pipe '39' and also to the inside of said first side of triple acting piston through pipe '9', via valve '2'and pipe T, causes movement of triple acting piston towards left that is from second hollow cylinder '12' to first hollow cylinder '13', the exhaust water through pipes '38', '27' pulls the triple acting piston towards left. Therefore water in said second side of triple acting piston (volume between ring '16' and disc '15') get compressed, directed towards valves '4' and '5'with pressure, closes one way valves '4' and '3', and opens one way valve '5' and water goes to output via pipe '6' with pressure greater than input pressure. Therefore, net force acting on the triple acting piston, pushes the piston towards left.<br>
7<br>
13 OCT 2008<br><br>
During this stroke of the piston assembly moves to the left as shown in fig. 1, second hollow cylinder '12' fills with water via pipes '39' and * 11' , as well as first side of triple acting piston (volume between ring '17' and disc '14') fills with water via boar'46\ The w^ter is ejected from second hollow cylinder '13' through pipe '27', valve '29' and pipe '30' goes to exhaust. Also water gets ejected with high pressure from second side of triple acting piston (volume between ring '16' and disc '15') and goes to output through pipe '8' and valve '5'through pipe '6At the end of stroke ring '23' and '25* fixed on rods '20'and '21' respectively, moves levers '32' and '33' to their second position, referring fig. 2, at this position of levers, water communication exists between cylinder '13' and input supply through pipe '38'and '10'^three way valve '7' and pipe T, also water communication exists between water inside cylinder '12' and exhaust water, through pipe '39', '26' three way valve '29'and pipe '30'. Now the circumstances are reversed, water exhausts from cylinder '12' via pipe '39', '26', valve '29' and pipe '30' and inlets in second side of triple acting piston (volume between ring '16' and disc '15'), from supply through pipe '8', valve '4' and pipe ' l', and also water inlets in cylinder '13' through pipe '38', '10', valve '7' and pipe '1' from supply, directs triple acting piston from first hollow cylinder '13' to second hollow cylinder '12',due to which water in first side of tHple acting piston (volume between ring '17' and disc '14') get compressecj and directed towards one way valves '2' and '3\ closes one way valve '2' and '5' and opens valve '3' and water goes to output via pipe '6' with pressure greater than input pressure.<br>
During this stroke of the triple acting piston, it moves towards right i.e. from first hollow cylinder '13' to second hollow cylinder '12' as viewed<br>
8<br>
1 3 OCT 2008<br><br>
in fig. '2', by ejecting water from cylinder '12' via boar '44' and from first side of triple acting piston (volume between disc '14' and ring *17'), at the end of this stroke rings '22' and '24' fixed on rods '20' and '21' respectively moves levers '32' and '33' to their first position viewed in fig. 1 and the same cycle repeats. Thus continuous high pressure water is obtained at the output through pipe '6' by using energy of low pressure water.<br>
The said piston assembly moves towards left or right due to input as well as exhaust water, therefore for water pressure converter conversion is possible at any level with respect to supply or reservoir water level.<br>
The pressure converter is used to lift the water from low level to high level that is to pump the water.<br>
During the rainy season large quantity of water runs away from the dams. There are many areas at few kilometers near by the dams, where the rain fall percentage is less can cause dearth or dearth like situation frequently. By using water pressure converter run away water from dam can be transported to those areas by canals or pipe lines and can be stored at other locations at higher level reservoirs for further use with the help of pipe line or canals, without using electricity or fuel.<br>
With this converter river water can be pumped and used for agriculture<br>
The pressure obtained can be adjusted by adjusting surface areas of disc '14' and '15', cross section area of cylinder '31'<br>
The necessary formula for pressure obtained and water discharge rate are derived as follows.<br>
Let<br>
Pi - input water pressure depends on the height of water supply level from converter<br>
9<br>
13 OCT 2008<br><br>
P2 -pressure exerted by exhaust water from converter depends on depth from converter to exhaust water level,<br>
A1-surface area of disc ('14'or '15')<br>
A2 -cross section area of inner cylinder '31'<br>
P3 -the pressure obtained as per requirement depends on height of the water reserve where water is to be transported.<br>
If 'dx' is small displacement in triple acting piston due to pressure Pi and P2 which are in one direction, then the total work done by incoming and out going water on piston is<br>
won = w1 + w2 + w3<br>
Wi - work done by incoming water collecting   at the   cylinder '12' or<br>
'13'viapipe'39'or '38' respectively.<br>
W2- work done by incoming water collecting in one of the side of the triple<br>
acting piston incoming through pipe '91 or '8'<br>
W3 - work done by water outgoing to exhaust form cylinder '13' or '12',<br>
via pipe'38'or '39' respectively.<br>
Won = P,A1 dx + P1A2dx + P2A1, dx	[as W = Pdv = PAdx]	(i)<br>
The work done by the piston on water stored at one of the side of the triple acting piston during previous stroke through pipe '8' or '9'<br>
Wby = P3A2dx		(ii)<br>
As work done on the piston is equal to work done by piston<br>
P3A2dx = P1A1 dx + P1A2dx + P2A1,dx	[ from (i) and (ii)]<br>
P3A2 = P1A1 + P1A2 + P2A1 therefore P3A2 = (P1+P2)A1 + P1A2 P3 = (P1+ P2)A1/A2+P1<br>
As A1 &gt; A2 The pressure obtained at output is greater than P1 and P2<br>
10<br>
13OCT 2008<br><br>
In terms of pressure heads as pressure proportional to water head<br>
H3 - output water head<br>
H1-Water head above the converter<br>
H2 -Water head below the converter<br>
Then<br>
H3 = (H1 + H2) A,/A2 + H1, As area is proportional to (diameter) H3 = ( H1, + H2) D12/D22 + H1 Where D1] is diameter of disc and D2 is diameter of inner cylinder.<br>
If '1' is stroke length displacement of triple acting piston between two fix positions, then the volume of low pressure water entering in water pressure converter in particular time is<br>
A, 1 + A21 =(A1+A2)1 The volume of high pressure water ejected at output is A21 in same time. If Q1 is rate of discharge of low pressure liquid entering in water pressure converter   and Q2 is the rate of discharge of high pressure liquid supplied by it then<br>
Q1/Q2 = (A1, + A2)/A2<br>
Thus the water pressure converter can be used for pumping the water from lower level to higher level as per requirement without fuel and electricity.<br><br>
