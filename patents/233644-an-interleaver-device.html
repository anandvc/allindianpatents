				<td>Field of the Invention:<br>
The present invention relates generally to interleaving in a communication system, and in particular, to a method of optimizing parameters according to an interleaver size for partial bit reversal order (P-BRO) interleaving and an interleaver using the same. The corresponding parent application number 1579/DELNP/2003.<br>
Description of the Related Art:<br>
While a sub-block channel interleaver designed in accordance with the IS- 2000 Release C (IxEV-DV) F/L specification performs P-BRO operation for row permutation similarly to an existing channel interleaver designed in accordance with the IS-2000 Release A/B spec. , the sub-block channel interleaver differs from the channel interleaver in that the former generates read addresses in a different manner and requires full consideration of the influence of a selected interleaver parameter on Quasi- Complementary Turbo code (QCTC) symbol selection.<br>
Hence, there is a need for analyzing the operating principles of the sub-block channel interleaver and the channel interleaver and creating criteria on which to generate optimal parameters for the channel interleavers.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Several preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described in<br>
detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the drawings, the same or similar<br>
elements are denoted by the same reference numerals, even though they are depicted in<br>
different drawings. In the following description, a detailed description of known<br>
functions or configurations incorporated herein have been omitted for conciseness.<br>
Hereinbelow, a description will be made of P-BRO interleaving to which<br>
various embodiments of the present invention are applied, as well as the principle of<br>
determining parameters for optimal P-BRO interleaving in accordance with<br>
embodiments of the present invention.<br>
Fig. 5 is a block diagram of a P-BRO interleaver to which an embodiment of<br>
the present invention is applied. Referring to Fig. 5, an address generator 511 receives an<br>
interleaver size N, a first parameter m (i.e., Bit_Shift), a second parameter J (i.e.,<br>
Up_Limit) and a clock signal Clock, and generates read addresses to read bit symbols<br>
from an interleaver memory 512. The parameters m and J are determined in an higherlayer<br>
controller (not shown) and provided to the address generator 511, or determined<br>
according to the interleaver size N in the address generator 511. The interleaver memory<br>
512 sequentially stores input bit symbols at write addresses corresponding to count<br>
values of a counter 513 in a write mode, and outputs bit symbols from read addresses<br>
received from the address generator 511 in a read mode. The counter 513 receives the<br>
clock signal Clock, generates a count value, and provides it as a write address Write<br>
ADDR to the interleaver memory 512.<br>
As described above, the P-BRO interleaver writes input data sequentially in<br>
the interleaver memory 512 in the write mode and reads data from the interleaver<br>
memory 512 according to read addresses generated from the address generator 511. For<br>
details of the P-BRO interleaver, reference is made to Korea Patent Application No.<br>
1998-54131, filed on December 10, 1998, the entire contents of which are expressly<br>
incorporated herein.<br>
In operation, the address generator 511 generates a read address Af for<br>
symbol permutation by<br>
A, = 2m (i mod J) + BROm (\i / J\)<br>
(1)<br>
where i=0, 1 , .  , N-l andN=2mxJ.<br>
In Eq. (1), N denotes the size of an interleaver input sequence and m and J<br>
are interleaver parameters called Up_Limit and Bit_Shift, respectively.<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates P-BRO interleaving when N=384, m=7 and J=3. Referring<br>
to Fig. 1, an interleaving matrix has 2m rows starting from index 0 and J columns starting<br>
from index 0. After step 101, the row index and column index of a symbol in the<br>
resulting matrix are expressed as Li/lJ and (i mod J), respectively. Therefore, after 2m(i<br>
mod J)+ Li/jJ, an ith symbol in an input sequence has a number corresponding to an<br>
Li/jJth row and an (I mod J) column as its read address. J symbols are in each row and<br>
the distance between symbols is 2m in the row.<br>
The row index Li/jJ is BRO-operated in step 102. If the distance between<br>
symbols in adjacent rows of the same column is row distance drow, the BRO operation of<br>
the row indexes results in a row permutation such that two minimum row distances drow<br>
are 2n^2 and 2"1-', as illustrated in Fig. 2. Thus, after 2m(i mod J)+ BROnj_i/J_], the ith<br>
symbol in the input sequence has a number corresponding to a BROnJ_i/J_lth row and an<br>
(i mod J)th column as its read address in the third matrix from the left.<br>
In summary, a read address sequence is generated by row permutations of a 2mx J matrix<br>
in the P-BRO interleaver. The row-permuted matrix is read first by rows from the top to<br>
the bottom, then subsequently reading each row from the left to the right.<br>
For clarity of description, the distance between adjacent addresses in the<br>
same row is defined as "intra-row distance dintra". If Jl, dintra=2m. If J=l, there is no<br>
intra-row distance.<br>
The distance between adjacent addresses in different rows, that is, the<br>
distance between the last address in a row and the first address in the next row is defined<br>
as "inter-row distance dinter". dinter is one of a plurality of values calculated from a<br>
function of the parameters m and J. When m and J are determined, the resulting<br>
minimum inter-row distance dinter is defined as d"'"er.<br>
Since two minimum rows distances drow are 2m~2 and 2ni~',<br>
Tf T 1 If J = J, djimnleirn = djnro"wn = 2-t nt-2,<br>
Else, d™',", = (J-J)-2m -2m~' = (2-J-3)-2""'<br>
(2)<br>
The reason for computing d"'"er by Eq. (2) when J*l is apparent in Fig. 2. If<br>
J=l, which implies that the interleaving matrix has only one column, d™"er is d'"^, that<br>
is, 2n"2.<br>
As described above, the interleaver parameters m and J are used as the<br>
numbers of rows and columns in a read address sequence matrix and parameters for a<br>
function that determines distances between read addresses. Consequently, the<br>
characteristics of the P-BRO channel interleaver depend on the interleaver parameters m<br>
and J.<br>
Before presenting a description of a method of determining sub-block<br>
channel interleaver parameters that ensure the best interleaving performance according<br>
to an embodiment of the present invention, the purposes of channel interleavers in the<br>
IS-2000 specifications, Releases A/B and C will first be described. Following that, the<br>
interleaver parameter determination will then be described separately in two cases:<br>
N=2mxJ; and N=2nlxJ+R.<br>
The purpose of channel interleaving in the IS-2000 specification, Release<br>
A/B, is to improve decoding performance, which is degraded when fading adversely<br>
influences successive code symbols, through error scattering resulting from symbol<br>
permutation. To improve decoding performance, interleaving must be performed such<br>
that the distance between adjacent addresses (inter-address distance) is maximized.<br>
Meanwhile, the purpose of sub-block channel interleaving as described in the<br>
IS-2000 specification, Release C, is to allow a QCTC symbol selector at the rear end of<br>
an interleaver to select appropriate code symbols according to a coding rate and thus<br>
ensure the best performance at the coding rate, as well as to scatter errors through<br>
symbol permutation. To achieve this purpose, interleaving must be performed such that<br>
inter-address distances are maximized and are uniform.<br>
Accordingly, to satisfy the requirements of the channel interleaver of the IS-<br>
2000 specification, Release A/B, and the sub-block channel interleaver of the IS-2000<br>
specification, Release C, an interleaver must be designed so that a read address sequence<br>
is uniformly permuted by interleaving. This is possible by determining the interleaver<br>
parameters m and j that maximize a minimum inter-address distance and minimize the<br>
difference between inter-address distances.<br>
As stated before, the inter-address distances are categorized into the intra-row<br>
distance dinlra and the inter-row distance dintcr. The intra-row distance is a function of m<br>
and the inter-row distance is a function of m and J. Since there are a plurality of interrow<br>
distances, a minimum inter-row distance d™er is calculated. A minimum interaddress<br>
distance is always 2'"~2 when J is 1, and the smaller of the minimum inter-row<br>
distance d™'"er and the minimum intra-row distance d™,n<br>
ra when J is not 1. The<br>
difference between inter-address distances is 2n)~2 when J is 1, since the intra-row<br>
distance dimra is 0, and is equal to the difference between the intra-row distance dintra and<br>
the minimum inter-row distance d*™er when J is not 1.<br>
This can be expressed as follows:<br>
IfJ=l,<br>
Else, j j min<br>
°lntra ainter<br>
(3)<br>
Since N=2mxJ, 2'" is replaced by N/J in Eq. (3), it follows that<br>
IfJ = l, 2m-2=--- = 0.25-,<br>

Else, d. -dmm<br>

 (4)<br>
When J=3 in Eq. (4), the difference between inter-address distances is minimized. Thus<br>
Table 1 below illustrates changes in inter-read address distances as m<br>
increases when N=384. When J=3, a maximum difference between inter-address<br>
distances is minimized, 64 and a minimum inter-address distance dmin is maximized, 128.<br>
Table 1<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The method of determining optimal interleaver parameters when N=2mxJ has<br>
been described above. Now, a method of determining optimal interleaver parameters<br>
when N=2mxJ+R will be described. Here, R is the remainder of dividing N by 2m. Thus<br>
R is a positive integer less than 2m.<br>
Fig. 3 illustrates P-BRO interleaving when N=408, nv=7, J=3 and R*0.<br>
Referring to Fig. 3, similarly to the case where R=0, numbers in a row-permuted matrix<br>
after step 302 are read as read addresses by rows from the top to the bottom, reading<br>
each row from the left to the right, as described in step 303. Since R*0, the number of<br>
columns is J+l, and numbers are filled in only R rows of a (J+l)th column with no<br>
numbers in the other (2m-R) rows.<br>
In summary, when R*0, a read address sequence is generated by a row<br>
permutation of a 2"'xJ matrix, each row including J or J+l elements in the P-BRO<br>
interleaver. The row-permuted matrix is read by rows from the top to the bottom,<br>
reading each row from the left to the right.<br>
Furthermore, when R#0, the interleaver parameters m and J are determined<br>
such that a minimum inter-read address distance is maximized and the difference<br>
between inter-read address distances is minimized.<br>
An inter-row distance dinter is a function of m, 2m irrespective of whether R=0 or<br>
However, while the minimum inter-row distance d™"er is a function of m and J when<br>
R=0, it is a function of m, J and R when<br>
The minimum inter-row distance is determined according to J by Eq. (5) and<br>
Eq. (6).<br>

Fig. 4 illustrates how Eq. (6) is derived when m=7 and J=3. Referring to Fig.<br>
4, when 0<r the inter-row distance between two adjacent rows having a row></r>
distance drow of 2"1"1, the last column of the upper row being empty, is a minimum interrow<br>
distance (dj£. = (2Jr-3)-2m"1 ). When 2nvl<r the inter-row distance></r>
between two adjacent rows having a row distance drow of 2nv2, the last column of the<br>
upper row being empty, is a minimum inter-row distance ( d"""er = (4J - 3) • 2m~2 ).<br>
When 3-2m~2<r the inter-row distance between two adjacent rows having></r>
a row distance drow of 2m~2 and elements in the last columns, is a minimum inter-row<br>
distance ( d,™"r = (2J - 1) • 2"1' ). For example, if R=0, the minimum inter-row distance , r is<br>
1""1 192, as indicated by reference numeral 401. If R=64 (21""1), the minimum inter-row<br>
distance is 288, as indicated by reference numeral 402. If R=96 (3-2n&gt;~2), the minimum<br>
inter-row distance is 320, as indicated by reference numeral 403. In the same manner, Eq.<br>
(5) can be derived when J=l .<br>
Table 2 below illustrates changes in the interleaver parameters J and R, the intra-row<br>
distance dilltra, the minimum inter-row distance d?™r , and the minimum inter-read<br>
address distance dmin as m increases, with respect to six encoder packet (EP) sizes as<br>
described in the IS-2000 specification, Release C.<br>
Table 2<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
As described above, similarly to the case where R=0, optimal interleaver<br>
parameters are selected which maximize a minimum inter-address distance and<br>
minimize the difference between inter-address distances.<br>
In Table 2, the minimum inter-read address distance dmm in the eighth column<br>
is the smaller of the intra-row distance d- and the minimum inter-row distance -mtn rf*" .<br>
Hence, parameters that maximize the minimum inter-read address distance dmin can be<br>
obtained by selecting a row having the maximum value in the eighth column. For EP<br>
sizes of 2328 and 3864, three rows and two rows satisfy this condition. In this case, rows<br>
that satisfy another condition of minimizing the difference between inter-read address<br>
must be selected. They are shown in bold and underlined in Table 2. The<br>
validity of this condition is apparent by comparing the rows having the maximum dmm in<br>
terms of n(dmi") in the last column. Here, n(dmin) indicates the number of address pairs<br>
having a minimum inter-address distance dmi".<br>
Rows marked in bold and underlined in Table 2 satisfy the above two<br>
conditions for selecting optimal interleaver parameters. As noted, once the second<br>
condition is satisfied, the first condition is naturally satisfied. For reference, it is made<br>
clear that the intra-row distances dinlra and the minimum inter-row distances d""" listed<br>
in Table 2 are equal to those computed on P-BRO-interleaved read addresses. Table 2<br>
covers both cases of dividing N by 2m or J with no remainder and of dividing N by 2mor<br>
J with a remainder R (i.e., N=2mxJ+R (0<r here interleaver parameters shown in></r>
bold and underlined are optimal for each EP size.<br>
When N=2mx(J-l)+R (0<r that is n divided by j either with no></r>
remainder or with a remainder R, optimal interleaver parameters for each interleaver size<br>
N are listed in Table 3. The description made in the context of J is also applied when J is<br>
replaced by (J-l).<br>
Table 3<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The above description has provided a method of selecting interleaver<br>
parameters expected to offer the best performance when, for example, a channel<br>
interleaver built in accordance with the IS-2000 Release A/B specification, and a subblock<br>
channel interleaver built in accordance with the IS-2000 Release C specification<br>
are used.<br>
As described above, the optimal interleaver parameters are those that<br>
maximize an inter-address distance and at the same time, minimize the difference<br>
between inter-address distances when generating read addresses in a channel interleaver.<br>
Consequently, interleaver parameters for sub-block channel interleaving in<br>
circumstances wherein a sub-block channel interleaver is built in accordance with the IS- 2000 Release C specification are values in the rows in bold and underlined in Table 2.<br>
While interleaver parameters selection has been described for the sub-block channel<br>
interleaver built in accordance with the IS-2000 Release C specification, it is obvious<br>
that the same thing can also be applied to systems of other standards.<br>
Fig. 6 is a flowchart illustrating an optimal interleaver parameters<br>
determining operation according to an embodiment of the present invention. Particularly,<br>
this operation is concerned with the computation of \dinlra - d""^ . An optimal (m, J)<br>
that minimizes dinlra - d™?er is selected by computing dinlra - d™r , changing (m, J).<br>
Referring to Fig. 6, when an interleaver size N, and parameters m and J are<br>
given in step 601, a parameter R is calculated by subtracting 2mxJ from N in step 603. In<br>
step 605, it is determined whether J is 1. This is a determination, therefore, of whether<br>
an interleaving matrix has a single column or not. If J is 1, the procedure goes to step<br>
607 ("Yes" path from decision step 605) and if J is not 1, the procedure goes to step 621<br>
("No" path from decision step 605). In step 607, it is determined whether R is 0(i.e.,<br>
whether N is an integer multiple of 2m). On the contrary, if R is 0 (("Yes" path from<br>
decision step 607), an intra-row distance dimra is set to 0 in step 609. If R is not 0 ("No"<br>
path from decision step 607) , dintra is set to 2m in step 617.<br>
After dintra is determined, it is determined whether R is less than 3x2n&gt;~2 in step<br>
61 1. If R is less than 3X2"1"2 ("Yes" path from decision step 61 1) a minimum inter-row<br>
distance d™r is set to 2"1"2 in step 613. If R is equal to or greater than 3x2n1~2 ("No" path<br>
from decision step 611) d"jer is set to 2mH in step 619. After d™'"r is determined,<br>
dintra -d™l"er\ is calculated in step 615.<br>
Meanwhile, if J is not 1 in step 605, djmra is set to 2m in step 621 and it is<br>
determined whether R is less than 2ni~' in step 623. If R is less than 2"^' ("Yes" path<br>
from decision step 623) d"","r is set to (2J-3)x2nv"' in step 625 and then the procedure<br>
goes to step 615. If R is equal to or greater than 2"*"1 ("No" path from decision step 623),<br>
it is determined whether R is less than 3x2m~2 in step 627. If R is less than 3x2m~2 ("Yes"<br>
path from decision step 627) , d^"w is set to (4J-3)x2ni~2 in step 629. If R is equal to or<br>
greater than 3x2n
step 631 and then the procedure goes to step 615.<br>
Optimal interleaver parameters m and J are achieved for a given N by computing<br>
dlnlra -rffoterl » changing (m, J). If J is one of 1, 2 and 3, a logical formula that facilitates<br>
selection of J without the repeated computation can be derived.<br>
With a description of a logical equation deriving procedure omitted, the<br>
logical equation is<br>
If log2N - [log, N\ 
Else if log,N-\logt N\ &gt;log23-l = 0.5849625,<br>
For ( 1} . 2L
 (7)<br>
From an optimal J from Eq. (7), an optimal m is calculated by<br>
m= Iog2<br>
(8)<br>
The selection of optimal interleaver parameters by the simple logical equations is<br>
summarized below and illustrated in Fig. 7.<br>
1. An optimal J is obtained by Eq. (7) for a given N; and<br>
2. m is calculated by computing Eq. (8) using N and J.<br>
Fig. 7 is a flowchart illustrating an optimal interleaver parameters<br>
determining operation according to another embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to Fig. 7, when N is given, a variable a is calculated by<br>
log2N-\log2 N\ and a variable p is calculated by 2\-loglN* in step 701. Decision step<br>
703, determines whether a is less than a first threshold, 0.5849625. If a is less than the<br>
first threshold ("Yes" path from decision step 703), another decision is made, whether N<br>
is less than p in decision step 705. If N is equal to or greater than p ("No" path from<br>
decision step 705), the procedure goes to step 707. On the contrary, if N is less than p<br>
("Yes" path from decision step 705), J is determined to be 3 in step 713.<br>
Meanwhile, decision step 707 determines whether N is less than (3/2)xp. If<br>
N is less than (3/2)xp ("Yes" path from decision step 707), J is determined to be 2 in<br>
step 711. Otherwise, J is determined to be 1 in step 709 ("No" path from decision step<br>
707).<br>
If a is equal to or greater than the first threshold in step 703 ("No" path from<br>
decision step 703), a decision is made whether N is less than (3/2)xp in decision step<br>
717. If N is less than (3/2)xp ("Yes" path from decision step 717), J is determined to be<br>
2 in step 721. Otherwise, decision step 719 determines whether N is less than (7/4)xp.<br>
If N is less than (7/4)xp ("Yes" path from decision step 719), J is determined to be 3 in<br>
step 723. Otherwise, J is determined to be 1 in step 725 ("No" path from decision step<br>
719).<br>
As described above, optimal m and J can be calculated simply by the logical<br>
equations using N. The optimal m and J are equal to m and J resulting from repeated<br>
computation using different (m, J) values as illustrated in Table 2. This obviates the need<br>
for storing optimal m and J values according to N values.<br>
When N=2328, for example, optimal m and J values are calculated in the<br>
procedure illustrated in Fig. 7 or by Eq. (8) to Eq. (10), as follows.<br>
a = log2N - [log, N\ = log, 2328 - [log, 2328 J = 11.1848753-11 = 0.1848753.<br>
a _ 2l'°«-'A'J = 2^'°s-2na^ = 2" = 2048.<br>
a ^0.5849625 and /3 = 2048 <n thus j="2.&lt;br/">
&amp;<br>
m =<br>
N<br>
\ = [log21164\ = 10. R = N-2m-J = 2328-2'° -2 = 280.<br>
J<br>
For reference, Eq. (7) is derived as follows.<br>
In each case depicted in Fig. 6, Eq. (5) and Eq. (6), dinlra -d™,"er\ is determined by<br>
A. WhenJ=l,<br>

Since N=2mJ+R and 0<r j-2m when this is divided by j and then></r>

Thus, m = . Using m = , J can be expressed as a function of N for<br>
all the cases of A and B.<br>
A'. When J=l, since m = \log2 N\, R = vV-2m = N-2l'°s-N]. Then the<br>
cases A-1, A-2 and A-3 can be expressed as functions of N. It therefore follows that:<br>
