				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
This invention relates to a process for conducting dehydration reaction<br>
using metal nanoparticles.<br>
This invention further relates to a process for conducting dehydration<br>
reactions using metal nanoparticles, in particular nickel and copper<br>
nanoparticles, under mild conditions.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Dehydration is a common step occurring in most organic reactions and<br>
sometimes the key step in a number of reactions for the preparation of<br>
important carbon-carbon skeletons.<br>
The Knoevenagel condensation is a useful carbon-carbon bond forming<br>
reaction, involving a step of dehydration. Knoevengel reaction has<br>
numerous applications in the synthesis of fine chemicals, hetero-Diels-<br>
Alder reactions and the synthesis of carbocyclic as well as hetero cyclic<br>
compounds. The reaction has been utilized in the preparation of<br>
coumarin derivatives, cosmetics, perfumes and pharmaceutical<br><br>
chemicals. Traditionally, this condensation has been carried out between<br>
a carbonyl compound and an active methylene compound in the<br>
presence of bases such as ethylenediamine, piperidine or corresponding<br>
ammonium salts, amino acids, dimethylaminopyridine and potassium<br>
fluoride mixture. Recently, efforts have been made to prepare<br>
electrophilic alkenes by conducting this reaction under heterogeneous<br>
conditions using inorganic salts like AL2O3, zeolite and calcite. Ionic<br>
liquids have also played a vital role as a reaction media for this<br>
condensation. However, some of these processes require harsh<br>
conditions and suffer from a lack of generality. In the process disclosed<br>
by Leelavathe etal al (J. Mol. Catalyst: A 2005, 240, 99). NbCl5 catalyst is<br>
used, which leads to a 93% yield of the condensed product, but the time<br>
required for the reaction is 1320 min.<br>
Further, Reddy etal (Tetrahedron Lett, 1997, 38, 1721) teaches a<br>
condensation method under heterogeneous conditions using zeolite,<br>
which leads to a 78% yield over a period of 720 min. Also, disclosed is a<br>
process by Yamawaki et al, where the inventors have used KF/AL2O3 as<br>
the catalyst for the condensation reaction, over a period of 150 min to<br>
arrive at a yield of 80%.<br><br>
Rao and Venkatraman (Tetrahedron Lett, 1991,32, 5821) have reported a<br>
condensation reaction using ZnCb as the catalyst. However, although the<br>
reaction time is 10 min, a temperature of 100°C has been employed to<br>
arrive at a yield of 91%.<br>
In typical cases when metal salts and other complexes are used as<br>
catalysts, an excessive amount of catalysts (usually in grams) is needed<br>
and this is eliminated as a Svaste product' and is often toxic.<br>
Hence there is an existing need for the development of milder methods<br>
for obtaining these products under conditions tolerated by sensitive<br>
functional groups from both synthetic and environmental points of view.<br>
The synthetic challenge is to carry out this reaction in a neutral medium<br>
thus avoiding the use of bases.<br>
The multi-component coupling reaction are emerging as a useful source<br>
for synthesizing small drug-like molecules with several levels of<br>
structural diversity and these reactions often involve dehydration<br>
reactions for the generation of intermediates and final products. They are<br>
also welcome in the context of economic and practical considerations.<br><br>
Moreover, multi-component coupling strategies offer significant<br>
advantages over conventional linear-type synthesizes. In such reactions,<br>
three or more reactants come together in a single reaction vessel to form<br>
new products. Solid phase peptide synthesis is a pertinent example that<br>
immediately comes to mind. The search and delivery for new multi-<br>
component coupling reactions on one hand and the full exploitation of<br>
the already known multi-component reactions on the other hand, is<br>
therefore of considerable current interest. Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), also<br>
known as glitazones, are a class of chemotherapeutics that increase<br>
sensitivity to insulin and are used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes<br>
mellitus. They increase the action of insulin in the liver, muscle and fat<br>
tissues. TZDs lower liver glucose production and enhance glucose uptake<br>
by the muscle and the fat cells. TZDs bind to and activate the nuclear<br>
receptor peroxisome-proliferator activated receptor γ (PPARγ) which in<br>
turn triggers the expression of insulin-responsive genes responsible for<br>
the regulation of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. Consequently, TZDs<br>
raise high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and tend to have variable effects on<br>
both low -density lipoprotein (LDL) and triglyceride levels. TZDs display a<br>
marked lowering of glycosylate haemoglobin (HbA1c) mean values, a<br>
prognosticator of serious diabetes complications.<br><br>
Currently two TZDs are used clinically in the US, rosiglitazone (Avandia)<br>
and pioglitazone (Actos). However in spite of their effectiveness, TZD are<br>
not used as widely as sulfonylureas and metaformin purportedly because<br>
of safety concerns and also because TZDs are relatively expensive. In this<br>
regard, thiaglitazone (a TZD analog) has been temporarily withdrawn<br>
because of liver toxicity; however other TZD analogues like rosiglitazone<br>
and pioglitazone eliminate the risk of hypoglycaemic episodes unlike<br>
sulphonylureas. This is because of the differences in their stated modes<br>
of action. While sulphonylureas act mainly by increasing insulin<br>
secretion, TZDs act on the nuclear PPARγ receptors and enhance<br>
transcription of several insulin sensitive genes. This process also has the<br>
added advantage of decreasing insulin resistance.<br>
Several synthetic approaches for the synthesis of TZDs are given in the<br>
literature but most of the compounds that have been synthesized so far<br>
are insignificant because most of these methods give unsatisfactory<br>
product yield even after prolonged reaction time. They also have critical<br>
product isolation procedures, use expensive and detrimental metal<br>
precursors and volatile organic solvents and require harsh reaction<br>
conditions such as high reaction temperature and a strong acidic media.<br>
Hence, there is a strong need to synthesize TZDs in more eco-friendly<br>
conditions.<br><br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION:<br>
It is therefore an object of this invention to propose a process for<br>
conducting dehydration reactions which uses mild reaction conditions.<br>
It is a further object of this invention to propose a process for conducting<br>
dehydration reactions which is eco-friendly and environmentally benign.<br>
Another object of this invention to propose a process for conducting<br>
dehydration reactions which is simple, involves simple steps of reaction,<br>
work-up and isolation and is cost effective.<br>
Yet another object of this invention to propose a process for conducting<br>
dehydration reactions, which has a wide range of substrate applicability.<br>
These and other objects of the invention will be apparent from the<br>
ensuing description.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:<br>
This invention relates to a process for conducting dehydration reactions<br>
using metal nanoparticles. The nanoparticels are copper or nickel<br><br>
nanoparticles which are prepared in a reverse micellar system. The<br>
metal nanoparticles are used to catalyse dehydration reactions such as<br>
in Knovenagel condensation or in multi-component coupling reactions.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Thus according to this invention is provided a process for conducting<br>
dehydration reactions using metal nanoparticles.<br>
In accordance with this invention, metal nanoparticles are used in<br>
dehydration reactions. The metal nanoparticles used are nickel and<br>
copper nanoparticles but are not restrinted to them while the<br>
dehydration reactions include but are not limited to Knoevengel<br>
condensation reactions and multi-component coupling reactions such as<br>
for the synthesis of thiazolidine 2,4-dione derivatives using mild, eco-<br>
friendly and environmentally benign conditions.<br>
A chemical method involving reduction of Ni2+-ions to Ni (0) and Cu2+ to<br>
Cu (O) in a reverse micellar system is employed to prepare the Nickel-or<br>
copper nanoparticles (Scheme-1).<br><br><br><br>
A surfactant, solvent (continuous phase), and a co-surfactant and<br>
aqueous solution of salts as dispersed phase (water core in which<br>
particle formation occurs) and are used to form the nanoparticle. The<br>
reverse micelles are prepared by dissolving the surfactant in solvent to<br>
obtain a solution. To a predetermined volume of the surfactant solution,<br>
an aqueous solution of a Nickel salt or a copper salt, followed by the co-<br>
surfactant is added to obtain an optically clear reverse micellar solution<br>
(RM-1). To another predetermined volume of the surfactant solution, a<br>
solution of a reducing agent is added to obtain a second reverse micellar<br>
solution (RM-2). To reverse micellar solution of metal (RM-1), the RM-2 is<br>
added dropwise with constant stirring, under an inert atmosphere,<br>
followed by further stirring to allow complete particle growth. The copper<br>
or nickel nanoparticles are extracted by adding absolute ethanol to the<br>
reverse micellar solution containing the nanoparticles followed by<br>
centrifugation. By varying the water content parameter Wo (defined as<br>
the molar ratio of water to surfactant concentration,<br>
Wo=H20/[surfactant], the sizes of nanoparticles can be controlled.<br>
The surfactant is selected from the group containing anionic, cationic<br>
and non-ionic type. Preferably Poly (oxyethylene) (tetra methyl butyl)-<br>
phenyl ether, commercially known as Triton X-100 (TX-100) is used as<br>
surfactant.<br><br>
The solvent used to form the reverse micelles is a hydrocarbon selected<br>
from saturated straight chain or branched chain C6 to C10 hydrocarbon,<br>
such as cyclo-hexane. The reverse micelles have a long chain alcohol<br>
from butanol to octanol as the cosurfactant. The surfactant is dissolved<br>
in the solvent to provide a 0.08 to 0.15 M solution.<br>
The Nickel salt is a water soluble salt of Nickel, such as for eg. Ni (NO3)2.<br>
The copper salt is water soluble salt of copper such as for eg. CuSO4.<br>
The Nickel or copper salt is added to TX-100 solution in Ho 3% w/v and<br>
hexanol is added (q.s) to obtain an optically clear reverse micellar<br>
solution RM-1. In a preferred embodiment, a 2% w/v solution is used.<br>
A reducing agent selected from sodium borohydride and diazine ( N2H2) is<br>
used to prepare the reverse micellar solution RM-2. The sodium<br>
borohydride is used as an alkaline solution, in which sodium<br>
borohydride (3 to 6% w/v) is added in a 2% NaOH (w/v) solution. In a<br>
preferred embodiment the sodium borohydride is a 5% w/v solution in<br>
2% NaOH (w/v). An aqueous solution of diazine is used in a<br>
concentration of 3 to 6% w/v. According to a preferred embodiment a 5%<br>
w/v aqueous solution is employed.<br><br>
After adding RM-1, the mixture is stirred under an inert atmosphere of<br>
nitrogen.<br>
The sizes of the nickel or copper nanoparticles prepared at W0=5 (the<br>
water content parameter WO can be defined as the ratio of molar<br>
concentration of water to surfactant, W0=[H2O]/ [surfactant] are<br>
confirmed as 15-20 nm through Quasi Elastic Light Scattering (QELS)<br>
Data an Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). The Ni-nanoparticles<br>
prepared are round in shape in black in color (colloidal state). The Cu-<br>
nanoparticles prepared are round in shape and brown in color (colloidal<br>
state). The sizes of the Cu-nanoparticles prepared at Wo=5 (the water<br>
content parameter Wo can be defined as the ratio of molar concentration<br>
of water to surfactant, Wo=[H20]/[surfactant] were confirmed as 14-18<br>
nm through Quasi Elastic Light Scattering (QELS) data and<br>
Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM).<br>
The Ni-nanoparticles thus prepared are used to catalyze the<br>
condensation of active methylene compounds, such as malonic acid,<br>
ethyl cyanoacetate, malononitrile and dimedone with aldehydes at room<br>
temperature in a neutral medium.<br><br>
The Ni-nanoparticles are added to a mixture of an aldehyde and an active<br>
methylene compound. The resulting reaction mixture is stirred for a<br>
specified period. After complete conversion, the reaction mixture is<br>
diluted and washed with water and brine. The organic layer is dried<br>
followed by evaporation of solvent under reduced pressure and<br>
concentrated to dryness gave the desired product, which followed by<br>
recrystalisation afforded the pure Knoevenagel products.<br>
The aldehydes are selected from the group of aliphatic aldehydes and<br>
aromatic aldehydes such as benzaldehyde and its derivatives such as<br>
chlorobenzaldehydes, nitrobenzaldehydes, hydroxybenzaldehydes,<br>
anisaldedehydes and any combination of the substituents. Ketones have<br>
also been used.<br>
The active methylene compounds are selected from malonic acid, ethyl<br>
cyanoacetate, malononitrile, dimedone and the like. The aldehyde/<br>
ketone and active methylene compound are used in a 1:1 proportion with<br>
a slight excess of the active methylene compound.<br>
The Ni-nanoparticle catalyst has a particle size below l00nm preferably<br>
between 15 to 20 nm and is used in a proportion between 5-20 mol% per<br>
5 mmol of the aldehyde/ketone.<br><br>
The reaction is conducted at a temperature in the range of 20 to 30°C,<br>
preferably at 25°C and over a period of about 1 hour.<br>
The reaction mixture is diluted with a polar solvent such as ethyl acetate.<br>
The Cu-nanoparticles are used for a simple, stereoselective one-pot three<br>
component condensation reaction between thiazolidine-2,4-dione,<br>
aldehyde and amine derivative. A solution of thiazolidine-2,4 dione,<br>
amine and aldehyde is prepared in a suitable solvent and the resulting<br>
mixture is stirred for a few minutes. Copper nanoparticles are added to<br>
the solution, and the reaction mixture is stirred at under inert<br>
atmosphere for an appropriate reaction time. After the completion of the<br>
reaction, the reaction mixture is centrifuged to pellet out the particles.<br>
The particles are then washed to remove all the organic impurities. These<br>
particles are reused for evaluating the performance in the next reaction.<br>
The aldehydes are selected from aromatic aldehydes such as<br>
benzaldehyde and derivatives such as chlorobenzaldehydes,<br>
nitrobenzaldehydes, hydroxybenzaldehydes, anisaldehydes and any<br>
combination of the substituents.<br><br>
The amine is an aromatic amine such as aniline and substituted<br>
anilines, where the substituents are selected from methyl,<br>
methoxy,benzene diazo and the like.<br>
The aldehyde and amine are present in equimolar proportions alongwith<br>
a two-fold excess of thiazolidine-2,4-dione.<br>
The Cu-nanoparticles are added in a proportion of about 10 mol% per 10<br>
mmol of aldehyde.<br>
The solvent used in the reaction is a protic solvent such as methanol,<br>
ethanol, polyethylene glycol and the like, preferably methanol.<br>
The reaction is conducted at about 45 to 55°C, preferably at about 50°C<br>
over a period of about 1 hour.<br>
The Cu-nanoparticles used have a particle diameter of 10 to 25 nm,<br>
preferably 14 to 18nm.<br>
The invention will now be explained in greater detail with the help of the<br>
following non-limiting examples.<br><br>
EXAMPLES:<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration of the present<br>
invention and should not be constructed to limit the scope of the<br>
invention.<br>
Example :1<br>
Preparation of Nickel nanoparticles:<br>
To a set volume of 100 ml (0.1 M TX-100 solutions in cyclohexane) 900μ1<br>
of Ni (NO3)2 aqueous solution (2% w/v) and hexanol (q.s.) was added to<br>
prepare an optically clear reverse micellar solution (RM-1). To another<br>
100 mL (0.1M TX-100 solution in cyclohexane) NaBH4 alk. Solution (5%<br>
w/v in 2% NaOH w/v aq. solution) and hexanol (q.s.) was added to<br>
obtain RM-2. To the prepared reverse micellar solution of Ni (NO3)2<br>
aqueous solution (2% w/v) (RM-1) another reverse micellar NaBH4 alk<br>
Solution (5% w/v in 2% NaOH w/v aq. solution) (RM-2) was added drop<br>
wise with constant stirring maintaining the nitrogen atmosphere. In the<br>
presence of nitrogen atmospher the resulting solution was allowed for<br><br>
further stirring for three hours to allow complete Ostwald ripening<br>
(particle growth. The nickel nanoparticles were extracted by adding<br>
absolute ethanol to the reverse micellar solution containing Ni<br>
nanoparticles followed by centrifugation at 3000-4000 rpm for 10<br>
minutes. By varying the water content parameter Wo (defined as the<br>
molar ratio of water to surfactant concentration, Wo =[H20]/[surfactant]<br>
the size of the nanoparticles could be controlled. The sizes of the Nickel-<br>
nanoparticles prepared at W0=5 (the water content parameter W0 can<br>
be defined as the ratio of molar concentration of water to surfactant,<br>
W0=[H2O]/[surfactant] were confirmed as 15-20 nm through Quasi<br>
Elastic Light Scattering (QELS) Data and Transmission Electron<br>
Microscopy (TEM). The Ni-nanoparticles prepared were round in shape<br>
and black in color (colloidal state).<br>
Example-2:<br>
Procedure for the Ni-nanoparticles catalysed Knoevenagel product:<br>
To a mixture of aldehydes (5.0 mmol), active methylene compound (6.0<br>
mmol) in Ethanol (10 ml) was added the catalyst Ni-nanoparticles (15-20<br>
nm, 10 mol%)., the resulting reaction mixture was stirred at room<br><br>
temperature for a specified period (Table 2 ). The progress of the reaction<br>
was monitored by thin layer chromatograpy (TLC), after complete<br>
conversion, as indicated by TLC; the reaction mixture was diluted by<br>
adding Ethyl acetate (50 ml) and washed with water thrice and brine.<br>
The organic layer was dried over anhydrous solution sulfate (Na2SO4)<br>
followed by evaporation of solvent under reduced pressure and<br>
concentrated to dryness gave the desired product, which followed by<br>
recrystalisation afforded the pure knoevenagel products in ~ 90 % yield<br>
(Table-2). Structural assignments of the products are based on their H-<br>
NMR, C-NMR, FT-IR and Mass analysis. The analysis of complete<br>
spectral and compositional data revealed other formation of Knoevenagel<br>
products with excellent purity.<br>
EXAMPLE-3<br>
Preparation of copper nanoparticles:<br>
To a set volume of 100 ml (0.1 M TX-100 solutions in cyclohexane) 900 μl<br>
of CuS04 aqueous solution (2% w/v) and hexanol (q.s.) was added to<br>
prepare an optically clear reverse micellar solution (RM-1). To another<br><br>
100 ml (0.1 M TX-100 solution in cyclohexane) N2H2 Solution (5% aq.<br>
solution) and hexanol (q.s.) was added to obtain RM-2. To the prepared<br>
reverse micellar solution of CuSO4 aqueous solution (2% w/v) (RM-1),<br>
another reverse micellar N2H2 Solution (5% aq. solution) (RM-2) was<br>
added dropwise with constant stirring maintaining the nitrogen<br>
atmosphere. In the presence of nitrogen atmosphere the resulting<br>
solution was allowed for further stirring for three hours to allow complete<br>
Ostwald ripening (particle growth). The nickel nanoparticles were<br>
extracted by adding absolute ethanol to the reverse micellar solution<br>
containing Cu-nanoparticles followed by centrifugation at 3000-4000<br>
rpm for 10 min. By varying the water content parameter Wo (defined as<br>
the molar ratio of water to surfactant concentration,<br>
W0=[H20]/[surfactant] the size of the nanoparticles could be controlled.<br>
The sizes of the Cu-nanoparticles prepared at Wo=5 (the water content<br>
parameter Wo can be defined as the ratio of molar concentration of water<br>
to surfactant, Wo=[H20]/[surfactant] were confirmed as 14-18 nm<br>
through quasi elastic light scattering (QELS) data and transmission<br>
electron microscopy (TEM). The Cu-nanoparticles prepared were round in<br>
shape and brown in color (colloidal state). TEM photographs confirmed<br>
the sizes of copper nanoparticles used in experiment.<br><br>
Example-4:<br>
Procedure for the Cu-nanoparticles catalysed thiazolidine-2,4 dione<br>
derivative:<br>
In a round bottomed flask, a solution of thiazolidine-2,4-dione (10 mmol),<br>
amine (5 mol) and aldehyde (5 mmol) was prepared in a suitable solvent<br>
(10 ml) and the resulting mixture was stirred for few minutes. Copper<br>
nanoparticles (10 mol%, 600 μl) were added to the solution, and the<br>
reaction mixture was stirred at 50°C under N2 atmosphere for the<br>
appropriate reaction time. The progress of the reaction was monitored by<br>
thin layer chromatography. After the completion of the reaction, the<br>
reaction mixture was centrifuged (5000 rpm, 10 min) to pellet out the<br>
particles. The particles were then washed with absolute ethanol to<br>
remove all the organic impurities. These particles were reused for<br>
evaluating the performance in the next reaction. Structural assignments<br>
of the products are based on their H NMR, C NMR, elemental and Mass<br>
analysis. The analysis of complete spectral and compositional data<br>
revealed the formation of thiazolidine-2,4-dione derivatives.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The metal nanoparticles work as an efficient catalyst for dehydration<br>
reactions, such as in Knoevenogel reaction and multi-component<br>
coupling reactions. The mild reaction conditions, medium to short<br>
reaction times, high to excellent yields, low cost and easy preparation<br>
and handling of the nanoparticles are the obvious advantages of the<br>
present method. Moreover, work-up is reduced to a filtration and<br><br>
evaporation of the solvent. Finally, these nanoparticles can be recovered<br>
by mild centrifugation and can be re-dispersed in the desired solvent and<br>
used again at least four times with negligible loss in its activity.<br><br>
