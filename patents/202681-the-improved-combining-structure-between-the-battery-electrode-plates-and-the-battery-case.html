2£-16<br><br>
2.	An improved battery electrode plate structure as claimed in<br>
Claim 1 wherein the bottoms of the positive electrode plates are series<br>
combined and the bottoms of the negative electrode plates are not<br>
series combined.<br>
3.	An improved battery electrode plate structure as claimed in<br>
Claim 1  wherein the bottoms of the positive electrode plates and the<br>
bottoms of the negative electrode plates are all respectively series<br>
combined.<br>
4.	An improved battery electrode plate structure as claimed in<br>
Claim 1 further comprising plate connectors extending from respective<br>
said negative and positive electrode plates for connecting said negative<br>
and positive electrode plates to said straps.<br>
5.	An improved battery electrode plate structure as claimed in<br>
Claim 4 wherein the bottom of the battery casing includes at least one<br>
foot slot for insertion of bottom ones of said plate connectors.<br>
ilf<br><br>
6.	An improved battery electrode plate structure as claimed in<br>
Claim 4 further comprising support posts extending upwards from the<br>
bottom of the battery casing to further support said negative and<br>
positive electrode plates within said battery casing.<br>
7.	An improved battery electrode plate structure as claimed in<br>
Claim 5 wherein said foot slots are filled with an epoxy resin to fill a<br>
space between the slots and the plate connectors, whereby said epoxy<br>
resin prevents acid drop-off from the electrode plates.<br>
8.	An improved battery electrode plate structure as claimed in<br>
Claim 5 wherein said foot slots are filled with an acid solution to fill a<br>
space between the slots and the plate connectors,  whereby said acid<br>
solution maintains an adequate acid remnant between the battery casing<br>
and the electrode plate to provide improved charging recovery.<br>
-22" 1*<br><br>
9.	An improved battery electrode plate structure as claimed in<br>
Claim 4 wherein said plate connectors are formed in pairs,   one each<br>
at an opposite diagonal corner of respective electrode plates.<br>
10.	An improved battery electrode plate structure as claimed in<br>
Claim 4 wherein each electrode plate includes only a single one of said<br>
plate connectors.<br>
11.	An improved battery electrode plate structure as claimed in<br>
Claim 1   wherein for a single cell compartment battery, the tops and<br>
bottoms of said negative and positive electrode plates are installed with<br>
extended power output terminals, and the top and bottom power output<br>
terminals of the electrode plates of the same polarity are arranged in<br>
positive-to-positive and negative-to-negative combinations.<br>
12.	An improved battery electrode plate structure as claimed in<br>
Claim 1 wherein for a battery having multiple cell compartments,<br>
-23-<br><br>
plates of negative and positive polarities between the cells are mutually series combined, the tops and bottoms of said negative and positive electrode plates are installed with extended power output terminals, and the top and bottom power output terminals of the electrode plates of the same polarity are arranged in positive-to-positive and negative-to-negative combinations.<br>
In order to improve vibration resistance of a battery, the bottoms as well as the tops of the negative and positive plates are respectively series combined. The bottoms may be combined using straps made of electrically conductive or non-conductive materials, and no facilitate integration of the bottoms of the plates into the casing, foot slots may be provided at the bottom of the battery casing for insertion of plate connectors used to connect the plates to the straps.</td>
