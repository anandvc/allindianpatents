Field of the Intention.<br>
This invention relates to an improved process for production of tocopherol concentrates from deodorized Soya distillates. The tocopherol conccniraics produced according to the process of the invention are useful as pharmaceuticals such as for prevention and treatment of circulatory heart disease, providing protection against cognitive impairment in older people, cosmetic applications such as sunscreen preparation, skin conditioner, moisturizers, as food    in food products that are high in fat content and animal farming as feed additive lo swine and poultry feeds due to their nutritional and antioxidant properties.<br>
The natural mixed tocopherol (Vit.E) which are used in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, food and animal farming industries is more expensive to manufacture because of their low content in raw materials and the complex chemical processes involved in their separation from the nontocophcrol components, yet has greater market value because of its higher efficiency as a nutrient and an antioxidant.<br>
The natural form of Vitamin E is a mixture of four forms of tocopherols, viz. a-, P", y- and 6-tocopherol. Concentrates of these tocopherols in commercial vegetable oils vary widely. Soya bean oil contains up to 0.27% of mixed tocopherols. During refinement of the oil, a deodorized distillate or sludge is obtained (yield 1 % of the oil) in which the mixed tocopherol content ranges from 3-8%. The other components of the distillate are glycerides, free fatty acids, sterols, terpenes, hydrocarbons etc.<br>
Soya sludge was considered as a waste product and used as an edible oil by poor people and its utility in processing for tocopherols is relatively recent in India. The invention can be considered as value addition to the waste product. The use<br><br>
of sludge for Vit E production is now done by H.K. Agro hem, Hinkle and Sonia Biochem industries chiefly using molecular distillation process.<br>
The synthetic Vitamin E, on the other hand, has a significantly lower value attached to it as it is used only as preservative. The a-tocopherol present in natural Vitamin E, functions as a nutrient, dietary supplement and as an antioxidant, while the other tocopherols present in it mainly function as antioxidants. Hence the higher value for natural form of Vitamin E.<br>
The processes currently employed for the manufacture of natural tocopherol earn be classified into two which are:<br>
(i) Process which converts a 3-8% mixed tocopherol containing raw material (deodorized vegetable oil distillate including the sludge obtained from soya bean oil refinement) to a 30% concentrate and (ii) Process which converts the product obtained   the process (i) or directly converting the raw material employed in process (i) (deodorized vegetable oil distillate) into at least 50% tocopherol concentrate.<br>
The main process step involved  in the above said  processes is the isolation of natural   tocopherols   by   separating   fiow  the   other  components   present   in deodorized distillates. State of the art in the Field.<br>
A process disclosed in US patent no. 2,704,764 dated. 22-3-1955 assigned to Refinery unincorporated involves esterification of the deodorized distillate followed by a series of steps to obtain tocopherol concentrate. The process consists of refluxing the deodorized soya sludge with methanol and cone. Sulphuric acid, cooling and filtering the precipitated sterols, distillation of methanol fiow the filtrate, washing the concentrate with water, followed by vacuum distillation of the methyl esters of fatty acids,   addition of methanol lo<br><br>
recover remaining sterols and distillation of methanol from the filtrate to get tocopherols.<br>
Another US patent no 5,512,691 dt. 30-4-1996 assigned to Eastman Chemical CD. discloses a process for the preparation of tocopherol concentrates containing 20-80% tocopherols from vegetable oil distillates involving esterification followed by a series of distillation steps. The process comprises first of an esterification reaction where the more volatile alcohols are converted to the less volatile laity acid esters followed by a series of distillation steps where components boiling higher and lower than the tocopherols are separated from tocopherols and other like boiling substances.<br>
The process of getting tocopherol concentrates involve esterification or saponification process to remove the fatty acids and the use of molecular distillation or short path distillation imit or wiped film reactor subsequently to obtain tocopherols of increased concentration. The two processes mentioned above are same as far as esterification and removal of fatty acids as esters is concemed. Subsequently the 2"^ process involves a series of (molecular) distillations to separate the components whereas the first process makes use of solvents to separate the components. The drawback, as per our observation, in the first process is formation of emulsions making it difficult to separate the organic and aqueous layers after esterification and washing to remove acid. Formation of emulsions results in the loss of tocopherols besides causing delay in processing . Further disadvantage is that the final methanol concentrate contains a lot of nO tocopherol material. The second process makes use of expensive equipment requiring high capital costs. There is no clear cut stage where sterols can be obtained as byproducts.<br><br>
The demand for natural tocopherols appears to be growing and the feasibility of a modified process without the use of molecular distillation to produce 5()*X) and more of tocopherols can be of importance.<br>
Preliminary market surveys indicated that marketing 30-40% tocopherol can be profitable if reliable raw material supply is assured. Higher tocopherol concentrates fetch even a better price. While surveying the literature we loud that both saponification and esterification processes can be used to remove the fatty acids and enrich the tocopherol content. While the saponification process provides 30% tocopherol concentrate further enrichment proved expensive requiring either short path distillation or extensive column chromatography. On the other hand the esterification route involved clear-cut stages for separation of fatty acids as esters, sterols, and tocopherols. It can also be less expensive provided the problems that are encountered are properly addressed.<br>
Due to the increased demand for natural tocopherols in pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, food and animal farming industries and the availability of soya sludge fiow a number of oil refineries in horde (M.P., India) we started to investigate tlie intricacies involved in the development of a suitable process of obtaining tocopherol concentrates. Objective of the Invention<br>
Therefore the main objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the production of tocopherol concentrates fiow deodorized soya distillates.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the production of 50% tocopherol concentrates besides providing valuable byproducts like sterols and fatty acids fiow deodorized soya distillates.<br><br>

Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the production of 50% and more tocopherol concentrates besides providing valuable byproducts like sterols and fatty acids from deodorized soya distillates without the use of molecular distillation.<br>

During our sustained research work in developing processes for natural tocopherols, we observed while working up of the esterified product, That the organic layer to be viscous and removing the acid from it by washing with water proved difficult and time consuming due to formation of emulsion. We tried adding non polar solvents like hexane or isopropyl ether to dilute the organic layer to overcome the problem. We also tried the molecular distillation process on a lab scale to enrich the tocopherols and found that the product gets distributed in a number of fractions. Besides the high cost of equipment, liberal use of liquid nitrogen for traps and other running costs made us try an alternative and less expensive process. Statement of Invention<br>

containing fractions are pooled and evaporated under reduced pressure to get the<br>
tocopherol concentrates with mixed tocopherol content of 48-54%.<br>
An improved    process as claimed in 16 wherein the tocopherol concentrate<br>
obtained is enriched    further elution methods to obtain 70% or more of<br>
tocopherols.<br>
An improved  process as claimed in claims 16 and   17  wherein the tocopherol<br>
concentrates obtained are enriched by elution methods for of-tocopherol content.<br>
