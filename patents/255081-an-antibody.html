				<td>AN ANTIBODY	<br>
Field of the Invention	<br>
The present invention relates to immunoglobulins, particularly antibodies<br>
that bind to NOGO and neutralise the activity thereof, polynucleotides encoding<br>
such antibodies, pharmaceutical formulations containing said antibodies and to<br>
the use of such antibodies in the treatment and/or. prophylaxis of neurological<br>
diseases. Other aspects, objects and advantages of the present invention will<br>
become apparent from the description below.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Stroke is a major cause of death and disability in the Western World.<br>
There is no approved therapy for the treatment of stroke other than tissue<br>
plasminogen (t-PA) which has to be administered within 3 hours of onset<br>
following a computer tomography (CT) scan to exclude haemorrhage. To date<br>
most therapeutic agents directed towards the treatment of acute stroke (i.e.<br>
neuroprotection), have predominantly involved targeting glutamate receptors and<br>
their down stream signalling pathways known to be involved in acute cell death.<br>
However to date these strategies have proved unsuccessful in clinical trials and<br>
are often associated with dose-limiting side effects (Hill &amp; Hachinski, The Lancet,<br>
352 : (suppl III) 10-14 (1998)). Therefore there is a need for novel approaches<br>
directed towards the amelioration of cell death following the cessation of blood<br>
flow. Neuroprotection is the ability of a treatment to prevent or ameliorate<br>
neuronal cell loss in response to an insult or disease process. This maybe<br>
achieved by targeting the neurons directly or indirectly by preventing glial<br>
(including oligodendrocyte) cell loss.<br>
Following the onset of stroke, some degree of spontaneous functional<br>
recovery is observed in many patients, suggesting that the brain has the (albeit<br>
limited) ability to repair and/or remodel following injury. Agents that have the<br>
potential to enhance this recovery may therefore allow intervention to be made<br>
much later (potentially days) following the onset of cerebral ischaemia. Agents<br>
which are able to offer both acute neuroprotection and enhance functional<br><br>
recovery may provide significant advantages over current potential<br>
neuroprotective strategies.<br>
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterised by the presence of two<br>
diagnostic features of pathology. These are amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary<br>
tangles composed of aggregated beta-amyloid peptide (Aβ40 and Ap42) and<br>
hyperphosphorylated tau respectively (Dawbarn &amp; Allen 2001 Neurobiology of<br>
Alzheimer's Disease OUP).<br>
A comprehensive study has shown a strong link in patients between beta-<br>
amyloid accumulation and cognitive decline (Naslund et al, JAMA, March 22/29,<br>
2000, Vol.283, No;12, page 1571-1577). This is consistent with genetic and<br>
epidemiological studies that suggest that some mutations in APP and presenilin<br>
genes can predispose to early onset AD, which mutations.also enhance the<br>
levels of Aβ40 and AB42 peptide, including the ratio thereof.<br>
Cleavage of the type I transmembrane amyloid precursor protein (APP) by<br>
two distinct proteases designated beta- and gamma-secretase is necessary for<br>
the formation of beta-amyloid peptide. The molecular identity of beta-secretase<br>
as the aspartyl-protease Asp2/BACE1 has been confirmed (Hussain et al<br>
Mol.Cell.NeuroSci. 16,609-619 (2000); Vassar et al, Science (1999), Oct.22; 286<br>
(5440):735-741). The nature of gamma-secretase remains the source of some<br>
debate and is likely to consist of a high molecular weight complex consisting of at<br>
least the following proteins: presenilins, Aph1, Pen2 and nicastrin (reviewed in<br>
Medina &amp; Dotti Cell Signalling 2003 15(9):829-41).<br>
The processing of APP within the CNS is likely to occur within a number of<br>
cell-types including neurons, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes and microglia. While<br>
the overall rate of APP processing in these cells will be influenced by the relative<br>
level of expression of APP, BACE1/Asp2, presenilin-1 and -2, Aph1, Pen2 and<br>
nicastrin.<br>
Furthermore, additional factors regulating the subcellular location of APP<br>
can also influence its processing as shown by the finding that mutation of the<br>
YENP motif in the APP cytoplasmic domain which blocks its endocytosis reduces<br>
beta-amyloid production (Perezetal 1999 J Biol Chem 274 (27) 18851-6).<br>
Retention of the APP-beta-CTF in the ER by the addition of the KKQN retention<br><br>
motif is sufficient to reduce amyloid production in transfected cells (Maltese et al<br>
2001 J Biol Chem 276 (23) 20267-20279). Conversely, elevation of endocytosis,<br>
by overexpression of Rab5 is sufficient to elevate amyloid secretion from<br>
transfected cells (Grbovic et al 2003 J Biol Chem 278 (33) 31261-31268).<br>
. Consistent with these findings further studies have shown that reduction of<br>
cellular cholesterol levels (a well known risk factor for AD) reduced beta-amyloid<br>
formation. This change was dependent on altered endocytosis as demonstrated<br>
by the use of the dominant negative dynamin mutants (K44A) and<br>
overexpression of the Rab5 GTPase activating protein RN-Tre (Ehehalt et al<br>
2003 J Cell Biol 160 (1) 113-123).<br>
Cholesterol rich microdomains or rafts are also an important cellular site of beta-<br>
amyloid production and APP, BACE1 and components of the gamma-secretase<br>
complex have all been shown to transiently reside within rafts. Antibody cross-<br>
linking of APP and BACE1 towards cholesterol rich rafts was able to elevate<br>
beta-amyloid production (Ehehalt et al 2003 J Cell Biol 160 (1) 113-123).<br>
Expression of GPl-anchored BACE1, which is exclusively targeted to lipid rafts, is<br>
similarly able to elevate APP cleavage and beta-amyloid production (Cordy et al<br>
2003 PNAS 100(20) 11735-11740).<br>
The mechanisms underlying functional recovery are currently unknown.<br>
The sprouting of injured or non-injured axons has been proposed as one possible<br>
mechanism. However, although in vivo studies have shown that treatment of<br>
spinal cord injury or stroke with neurotrophic factors results in enhanced<br>
functional recovery and a degree of axonal sprouting, these do not prove a direct<br>
link between the degree of axonal sprouting and extent of functional recovery<br>
(Jakeman, et al. 1998, Exp. Neurol. 154:170-184, Kawamata et al. 1997, Proc<br>
Natl Acad. Sci. USA., 94:8179-8184, Ribotta, etal. 2000, J Neurosci. 20: 5144-<br>
5152). Furthermore, axonal sprouting requires a viable neuron. In diseases such<br>
as stroke which is associated with extensive cell death, enhancement of<br>
functional recovery offered by a given agent post stroke may therefore be<br>
through mechanisms other than axonal sprouting such as differentiation of<br><br>
endogenous stem cells, activation of redundant pathways, changes in receptor distribution or excitability of neurons or glia (Fawcett &amp; Asher, 1999, Brain Res.<br>
Bulletin, 49: 377-391, Horner &amp; Gage, 2000, Nature 407 963-970).<br>
The limited ability of the central nervous system (CNS) to repair following<br>
injury is thought in part to be due to molecules within the CNS environment that<br>
have an inhibitory effect on axonal sprouting (neurite outgrowth). CNS myelin is<br>
thought to contain inhibitory molecules (Schwab ME and Caroni P (1988) J.<br>
Neurosci. 8,2381-2193). Two myelin proteins, myelin-associated glycoprotein<br>
(MAG) and NOGO have been cloned and identified as putative inhibitors of<br>
neurite outgrowth (Sato S. et al (1989) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm.163,1473-<br>
1480; McKerracher L et al (1994) Neuron 13,805-811; Mukhopadhyay G et al<br>
(1994) Neuron 13,757-767; Torigoe K and Lundborg G (1997) Exp. Neurology<br>
150,254-262; Schafer et al (1996) Neuron 16,1107-1113; W09522344;<br>
WO9701352; Prinjha R et al (2000) Nature 403,383-384; Chen MS et al (2000)<br>
Nature 403,434-439; GrandPre T et al (2000) Nature 403,439-444;<br>
US005250414A; WO200005364A1; WO0031235).<br>
Three forms of human NOGO have been identified: NOGO-A having 1192<br>
amino acid residues (GenBank accession no. AJ251383); NOGO-B, a splice<br>
variant which lacks residues 186 to 1004 in the putative extracellular domain<br>
(GenBank accession no. AJ251384) and a shorter splice variant, NOGO-C,<br>
which also lacks residues 186 to 1004 and also has smaller, alternative amino<br>
terminal domain (GenBank accession no. AJ251385) (Prinjha et al (2000) supra).<br>
Inhibition of the CNS inhibitory proteins such as NOGO may provide a<br>
therapeutic means to ameliorate neuronal damage and promote neuronal repair<br>
and growth thereby potentially assisting recovery from neuronal injury such as<br>
that sustained in stroke. Examples of such NOGO inhibitors may include small<br>
molecules, peptides and antibodies.<br>
Antibodies typically comprise two heavy chains linked together by<br>
disulphide bonds and two light chains. Each light chain is linked to a respective<br>
heavy chain by disulphide bonds. Each heavy chain has at one end a variable<br>
domain followed by a number of constant domains. Each light chain has a<br>
variable domain at one end and a constant domain at its other end. The light<br>
chain variable domain is aligned with the variable domain of the heavy chain.<br><br>
The light chain constant domain is aligned with the first constant domain of the - -<br>
heavy chain. The constant domains in the light and heavy chains are not<br>
involved directly in binding the antibody to antigen.<br>
The variable domains of each pair of light and heavy chains form the<br>
antigen binding site. The variable domains on the light and heavy chains have<br>
the same general structure and each domain comprises a framework of four<br>
regions, whose sequences are relatively conserved, connected by three<br>
complementarity determining regions (CDRs) often referred to as hypervariable<br>
regions. The four framework regions largely adopt a beta-sheet conformation<br>
and the CDRs form loops connecting, and in some cases forming part of, the<br>
beta-sheet structure. The CDRs are held in close proximity by the framework<br>
regions and, with the CDRs from the other domain, contribute to the formation of<br>
the antigen binding site. CDRs and framework regions of antibodies may be<br>
determined by reference to Kabat et al ("Sequences of proteins of immunological<br>
interest" US Dept. of Health and Human Services, US Government Printing<br>
Office, 1987).<br>
It has been found that anti-MAG monoclonal antibodies^described<br>
(Poltorak et al (1987) Journal of Cell Biology 105,1893-1899, DeBellard et al<br>
(1996) Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 7,89-101; Tang et al (1997) Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 9,<br>
333-346; Torigoe K and Lundborg G (1997) Exp. Neurology 150,254-262) and<br>
commercially available (MAB1567 (Chemicon)) when administered either directly<br>
into the brain or intravenously following focal cerebral ischaemia in the rat (a<br>
" model of stroke), provides neuroprotection and enhances functional recovery<br>
(PCT/EP03/08749).<br>
Therefore anti-MAG antibodies provide potential therapeutic agents for<br>
both acute neuroprotection as well as the promotion of functional recovery<br>
following stroke. This antibody is a murine antibody. Although murine<br>
antibodies are often used as diagnostic agents their utility as a therapeutic has<br>
been proven in only a few cases. Their limited application is in part due to the<br>
repeated administration of a murine monoclonal antibody to a human usually<br>
elicits human immune responses against these molecules. To overcome these<br>
intrinsic undesirable properties of murine antibodies, "altered" antibodies<br>
designed to incorporate regions of human antibodies have been developed and<br><br>
are well established in the art. For example, a humanised antibody contains<br>
complementarity determining regions ("CDR's") of non human origin and the<br>
majority of the rest of the structure is derived from a human antibody.<br>
It has also been reported that a murine monoclonal antibody, IN-1, that<br>
was raised against NI-220/250, a myelin protein which is a potent inhibitor of<br>
neurite growth (and subsequently shown to be fragment of NOGO-A), promotes<br>
axonal regeneration (Caroni, P and Schwab, ME (1988) Neuron 1 85-96; Schnell,<br>
L and Schwab, ME (1990) Nature 343 269-272; Bregman, BS et al (1995) Nature<br>
378 498-501 and Thallmair, M et al (1998) Nature Neuroscience 1 124-131). It<br>
has also been reported that NOGO-A is the antigen for IN-1 (Chen et al (2000)<br>
Nature 403 434-439). Administration of IN-1 Fab fragment or humanised IN-1 to<br>
rats that have undergone spinal cord transection, enhanced recovery (Fiedler, M<br>
et al (2002) Protein Eng 15 931-941; Brosamle, C et al (2000) J. Neuroscience<br>
20 8061-8068). However to date there is no evidence in the literature to suggest<br>
that IN-1, or its humanised form, can bind and inhibit human NOGO-A, a<br>
necessary requirement for a monoclonal antibody to be useful in the therapeutic<br>
treatment of NOGO-mediated diseases and disorders such as stroke and<br>
neurodegenerative diseases in humans.<br>
Therefore it remains a highly desirable goal to isolate and develop a<br>
therapeutically useful monoclonal antibody that binds and inhibits the activity of<br>
human NOGO. The process of neurodegeneration underlies many neurological<br>
diseases/disorders including, but not limited to, acute diseases such as stroke<br>
(ischemic or haemorrhagic), traumatic brain injury and spinal cord injury as well<br>
as chronic diseases including Alzheimer's disease, fronto-temporal dementias<br>
(tauopathies), peripheral neuropathy, Parkinson's disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob<br>
disease (CJD), Schizophrenia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), multiple<br>
sclerosis, Huntington's disease, multiple sclerosis and inclusion body myositis.<br>
Consequently an anti-NOGO monoclonal antibody may be useful in the<br>
treatment of these diseases/disorders. Such antibodies for the treatment of the<br>
above mentioned disease/disorders are provided by the present invention and<br>
described in detail below.<br><br>
All publications, both journal and patent, disclosed in this present<br>
specification are expressly and entirely incorporated herein by reference.<br>

shown in the tables 1 to 6 which show the CDRs of three such independently<br>
isolated antibodies: 2A10/3,2C4/1 and 15C3/3. The CDR's are identified as<br>

the principles of protein structure and folding as defined by Chothia and Lesk,<br>
(Chothia et al., (1989) "Conformations of immunoglobulin hypervariable regions";<br>
Nature 342, p877-883) it will be appreciated that additional residues may also be<br>
considered to be part of the antigen binding region and are thus encompassed by<br>
the present invention.<br><br><br><br><br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
Antibodies of the invention are typically monoclonal antibodies (mAb) and are<br>
preferably chimeric, humanised, fully human or reshaped. Of these humanised<br>
and fully human are particularly preferred.<br>
Antibodies of the invention typically have the structure of a natural antibody or<br>
functional fragment thereof. The antibody may therefore comprise a full length<br>
antibody, a (Fab')2 fragment, a Fab fragment, a light chain dimer or a heavy chain<br>
dimer. The antibody may be an lgG1, lgG2, lgG3, or lgG4; or IgM; IgA, IgE or<br>
IgD or a modified variant thereof. The constant domain of the antibody heavy<br>
chain may be selected accordingly. The light chain constant domain may be a<br>
kappa or lambda constant domain. Furthermore, the antibody may comprise<br>
modifications of all classes eg IgG dimers, Fc mutants that no longer bind Fc<br>
receptors or mediate Clq binding. The antibody may also be a chimeric antibody<br>
of the type described in WO86/01533 which comprises an antigen binding region<br>
and a non-immunoglobulin region. The antigen binding region is an antibody<br>
light chain variable domain or heavy chain variable domain. Typically the antigen<br>
binding region comprises both light and heavy chain variable domains. The non-<br>
immunoglobulin region is fused at its C terminus to the antigen binding region.<br><br>
The non-immunoglobulin region is typically a non-immunoglobulin protein and<br>
may be an enzyme, a toxin or protein having known binding specificity. The two<br>
regions of this type of chimeric antibody may be connected via a cieavable linker<br>
sequence. Immunoadhesins having the CDRs as hereinbefore described are<br>
also contemplated in the present invention.<br>
The constant region is selected according to the functionality required.<br>
Normally an lgG1 will demonstrate lytic ability through binding to complement<br>
and/or will mediate ADCC (antibody dependent cell cytotoxicity). An lgG4 will be<br>
preferred if a non-cytotoxic blocking antibody is required. However, lg
antibodies can demonstrate instability in production and therefore it may be more<br>
preferable to modify the generally more stable lgG1. Suggested modifications<br>
are described in EP0307434 preferred modifications include at positions 235 and<br>
237. The invention therefore provides a lytic or a non-lytic form of an antibody<br>
according to the invention.<br>
In preferred forms therefore the antibody of the invention is a full length<br>
(i.e. H2L2 tetramer) non-lytic lgG1 antibody having the CDRs described supra.<br>
In most preferred forms we provide a full length non-lytic lgG1 antibody having<br>
the CDRs of SEQ ID NOs 1 to 6; SEQ ID NOs 7 to 12 or SEQ ID NOs 13 to 18.<br>
In a further aspect, the invention provides polynucleotides encoding the<br>
CDRs. For example the invention provides polynucleotides encoding CDRH1,<br>
CDRH2, CDRH3, CDRL1, CDRL2 and CDRL3 as disclosed in tables 1 to 6.<br>

table 5.<br>
In a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a polynucleotide<br>
encoding a heavy chain variable region of an anti-NOGO antibody including at<br>
least one CDR selected from CDRH1, CDRH2 and CDRH3, more preferably<br>
including ail 3 CDRs in table 2 or all 3 CDRs in table 4 or all 3 CDRs in table 6.<br><br>
The invention further provides an anti-NOGO antibody, or functional<br>

"NOGO" refers to any NOGO polypeptide, including variant forms. This<br>
includes, but is not limited to, NOGO-A having 1192 amino acid residues<br>
(GenBank accession no. AJ251383); NOGO-B, a splice variant which lacks<br>
residues 186 to 1004 in the putative extracellular domain (GenBank accession<br>
no. AJ251384) and a shorter splice variant, NOGO-C, which also lacks residues<br>
186 to 1004 and also has smaller, alternative amino terminal domain (GenBank<br>
accession no. AJ251385) (Prinjha et al (2000) supra). All references to "NOGO"<br>
herein is understood to include any and all variant forms of NOGO such as<br>
NOGO-A and the splice variants described, unless a specific form is indicated.<br>
"Neutralising" and grammatical variations thereof refers to inhibition, either<br>
total or partial, of NOGO function including its binding to neurones and inhibition<br>
of neurite growth.<br>
"Altered antibody" refers to a protein encoded by an altered<br>
immunoglobulin coding region, which may be obtained by expression in a<br><br>
selected host cell. Such altered antibodies include engineered antibodies (e.g.,<br>
chimeric, reshaped, humanized or vectored antibodies) or antibody fragments<br>
lacking all or part of an immunoglobulin constant region, e.g., Fv, Fab, or F(ab)2<br>
and the like.<br>
"Altered immunoglobulin coding region" refers to a nucleic acid sequence<br>
encoding altered antibody. When the altered antibody is a CDR-grafted or<br>
humanized antibody, the sequences that encode the complementarity<br>
determining regions (CDRs) from a non-human immunoglobulin are inserted into<br>
a first immunoglobulin partner comprising human variable framework sequences.<br>
Optionally, the first immunoglobulin partner is operatively linked to a second<br>
immunoglobulin partner.<br>
"First immunoglobulin partner" refers to a nucleic acid sequence encoding<br>
a human framework or human immunoglobulin variable region in which the native<br>
(or naturally-occurring) CDR-encoding regions are replaced by the CDR-<br>
encoding regions of a donor antibody. The human variable region can be an<br>
immunoglobulin heavy chain, a light chain (or both chains), an analog or<br>
functional fragments thereof. Such CDR regions, located within the variable<br>
region of antibodies (immunoglobulins) can be determined by known methods in<br>
the art. For example Kabat et al. (Sequences of Proteins of Immunological<br>
Interest, 4th Ed., U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National<br>
Institutes of Health (1987)) disclose rules for locating CDRs. In addition,<br>
computer programs are known which are usefui for identifying CDR<br>
regions/structures.<br>
"Second immunoglobulin partner" refers to another nucleotide sequence<br>
encoding a protein or peptide to which the first immunoglobulin partner is fused in<br>
frame or by means of an optional conventional linker sequence (i.e., operatively<br>
linked). Preferably it is an immunoglobulin gene. The second immunoglobulin<br>
partner may include a nucleic acid sequence encoding the entire constant region<br>
for the same (i.e., homologous - the first and second altered antibodies are<br>
derived from the same source) or an additional (i.e., heterologous) antibody of<br>
interest. It may be an immunoglobulin heavy chain or light chain (or both chains<br>
as part of a single polypeptide). The second immunoglobulin partner is not<br>
limited to a particular immunoglobulin class or isotype. In addition, the second<br><br>
immunoglobulin partner may comprise part of an immunoglobulin constant<br>
region, such as found in a Fab, or F(ab)2 (i.e., a discrete part of an appropriate<br>
human constant region or framework region). Such second immunoglobulin<br>
partner may also comprise a sequence encoding an integral membrane protein<br>
exposed on the outer surface of a host cell, e.g., as part of a phage display<br>
library, or a sequence encoding a protein for analytical or diagnostic detection,<br>
e.g., horseradish peroxidase, p-galactosidase, etc.<br>
The terms Fv, Fc, Fd, Fab, or F(ab)2 are used with their standard<br>
meanings (see, e.g., Harlow et al., Antibodies A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring<br>
Harbor Laboratory, (1988)).<br>
As used herein, an "engineered antibody" describes a type of altered<br>
antibody, i.e., a full-length synthetic antibody (e.g., a chimeric, reshaped or<br>
humanized antibody as opposed to an antibody fragment) in which a portion of<br>
the light and/or heavy chain variable domains of a selected acceptor antibody are<br>
replaced by analogous parts from one or more donor antibodies which have<br>
specificity for the selected epitope. For example, such molecules may include<br>
antibodies characterized by a humanized heavy chain associated with an<br>
unmodified light chain (or chimeric light chain), or vice versa. Engineered<br>
antibodies may also be characterized by alteration of the nucleic acid sequences<br>
encoding the acceptor antibody light and/or heavy variable domain framework<br>
regions in order to retain donor antibody binding specificity. These antibodies<br>
can comprise replacement of one or more CDRs (preferably all) from the<br>
acceptor antibody with CDRs from a donor antibody described herein.<br>
A "chimeric antibody" refers to a type of engineered antibody which<br>
contains a naturally-occurring variable region (light chain and heavy chains)<br>
derived from a donor antibody in association with light and heavy chain constant<br>
regions derived from an acceptor antibody.<br>
A "humanized antibody" refers to a type of engineered antibody having its<br>
CDRs derived from a non-human donor immunoglobulin, the remaining<br>
immunogiobulin-derived parts of the molecule being derived from one (or more)<br>
human immunoglobulin(s). In addition, framework support residues may be<br>
altered to preserve binding affinity (see, e.g., Queen et al., Proc. Nati Acad Sci<br>
USA, 86:10029-10032 (1989), Hodgson et al., Bio/Technology, 9:421 (1991)). A<br><br>
suitable human acceptor antibody may be one selected from a conventional<br>
database, e.g., the KABAT® database, Los Alamos database, and Swiss Protein<br>
database, by homology to the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the donor<br>
antibody. A human antibody characterized by a homology to the framework<br>
regions of the donor antibody (on an amino acid basis) may be suitable to<br>
provide a heavy chain constant region and/or a heavy chain variable framework<br>
region for insertion of the donor CDRs. A suitable acceptor antibody capable of<br>
donating light chain constant or variable framework regions may be selected in a<br>
similar manner. It should be noted that the acceptor antibody heavy and light<br>
chains are not required to originate from the same acceptor antibody. The prior<br>
art describes several ways of producing such humanised antibodies - see for<br>
example EP-A-0239400 and EP-A-054951<br>
"Reshaped human antibody" refers to an altered antibody in which<br>
minimally at least one CDR from a first human monoclonal donor antibody is<br>
. substituted for a CDR in a second human acceptor antibody. Preferrably all six<br>
CDRs are replaced. More preferrably an entire antigen combining region (e.g.,<br>
Fv, Fab or F(ab')2) from a first human donor monoclonal antibody is substituted<br>
for the corresponding region in a second human acceptor monoclonal antibody.<br>
Most preferrably the Fab region from a first human donor is operatively linked to<br>
the appropriate constant regions of a second human acceptor antibody to form a<br>
full length monoclonal antibody.<br>
A "vectored antibody" refers to an antibody to which an agent has been<br>
attached to improve transport through the blood brain barrier (BBB). (Review see<br>
Pardridge; Advanced Drug Delivery Review 36, 299-321,1999). The attachment<br>
may be chemical or alternatively the moiety can be engineered into the antibody.<br>
One example is to make a chimera with an antibody directed towards a brain<br>
capillary endothelial cell receptor e.g. an anti-insulin receptor antibody or anti-<br>
transferrin receptor antibody (Saito et al (1995) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 92<br>
10227-31; Pardridge et al (1995) Pharm. Res. 12 807-816; Broadwell et al (1996)<br>
Exp. Neurol. 142 47-65; Bickel et al (1993) Proc Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90,2618-<br>
2622; Friden et al (1996) J. Pharm. Exp, Then 278 1491-1498, US5182107,<br>
US5154924, US5833988, US5527527). Once bound to the receptor, both<br>
components of the bispecific antibody pass across the BBB by the process of<br><br>
transcytosis. Alternatively the agent may be a ligand which binds such cell<br>
surface receptors eg insulin, transferrin or low density lipoprotein (Descamps et<br>
al (1996) Am. J. Physiol. 270 H1149-H1158; Duffy et ai (1987) Brain Res. 420<br>
32-38; Dehouck et al (1997) J. Cell Biol. 1997 877r889). Naturally occuring<br>
peptides such as penetratin and SynB1 and Syn B3 which are known to improve<br>
transport across the BBB can. also be used (Rouselle et al (2000) Mol. Pharm.57,<br>
679-686 and Rouselle et al (2001) Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental<br>
Therapeutics 296,124-131).<br>
The term "donor antibody" refers to an antibody (monoclonal, and/or<br>
recombinant) which contributes the amino acid sequences of its variable regions,<br>
CDRs, or other functional fragments or analogs thereof to a first immunoglobulin<br>
partner, so as to provide the altered immunoglobulin coding region and resulting<br>
expressed altered antibody with the antigenic specificity and neutralizing activity<br>
characteristic of the donor antibody.<br>
The term "acceptor antibody" refers to an antibody (monoclonal and/or<br>
recombinant) heterologous to the donor antibody, which contributes all (or any<br>
portion, but preferably all) of the amino acid sequences encoding its heavy and/or<br>
light chain framework regions and/or its heavy and/or light chain constant regions<br>
to the first immunoglobulin partner. Preferably a human antibody is the acceptor<br>
antibody.<br>
"CDRs" are defined as the complementarity determining region amino acid<br>
sequences of an antibody which are the hypervariable regions of immunoglobulin<br>
heavy and light chains. See, e.g., Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of<br>
Immunological Interest, 4th Ed., U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,<br>
National Institutes of Health (1987). There are three heavy chain and three light<br>
chain CDRs (or CDR regions) in the variable portion of an immunoglobulin.<br>
Thus, "CDRs" as used herein refers to all three heavy chain CDRs, or all three<br>
light chain CDRs (or both all heavy and all light chain CDRs, if appropriate).<br>
The structure and protein folding of the antibody may mean that other residues<br>
are considered part of the antigen binding region and would be understood to be<br>
so by a skilled person. See for example Chothia et al., (1989) Conformations of<br>
immunoglobulin hypervariable regions; Nature 342, p877-883. For convenience<br>
the CDR's as defined by Kabat in SEQ ID Nos 37-42 are boxed.<br><br>
CDRs provide the majority of contact residues for the binding of the<br>
antibody to the antigen or epitope. CDRs of interest in this invention are derived<br>
from donor antibody variable heavy and light chain sequences, and include<br>
analogs of the naturally occurring CDRs, which analogs also share or retain the<br>
same antigen binding specificity and/or neutralizing ability as the donor antibody<br>
from which they were derived.<br>
A "functional fragment" is a partial heavy or light chain variable sequence<br>
(e.g., minor deletions at the amino or carboxy terminus of the immunoglobulin<br>
variable region) which retains the same antigen binding specificity and the same<br>
or similar neutralizing ability as the antibody from which the fragment was<br>
derived.<br>
An "analog" is an amino acid sequence modified by at least one amino<br>
acid, wherein said modification can be chemical or a substitution or a<br>
rearrangement of a few amino acids (i.e., no more than 10), which modification<br>
permits the amino acid sequence to retain the biological characteristics, e.g.,<br>
antigen specificity and high affinity, of the unmodified sequence. For example,<br>
(silent) mutations can be constructed, via substitutions, when certain<br>
endonuclease restriction sites are created within or surrounding CDR-encoding<br>
regions. The present invention contemplates the use of analogs of the antibody<br>
of the invention. It is well known that minor changes in amino acid or nucleic acid<br>
sequences may lead eg to an allelic form of the original protein which retains<br>
substantially similar properties. Thus analogs of the antibody of the invention<br>
includes those in which the CDRs in the hypervariable region of the heavy and<br>
light chains are at least 80% homologous, preferably at least 90 % homologous<br>
and more preferably at least 95 % homologous to the CDRs as defined above as<br>
CDRH1, CDRH2, CDRH3, CDRL1, CDRL2 and CDRL3 in tables 1 to 6 and<br>
retain NOGO neutralising activity. Amino acid sequences are are at least 80%<br>
homologous if they have 80% identical amino acid residues in a like position<br>
when the sequences are aligned optimally, gaps or insertions being counted as<br>
non-identical residues. The invention also contemplates analogs of the antibodies<br>
of the invention wherein the framework regions are at least 80%, preferably at<br>
least 90% and more preferably at least 95% homologous to the framework<br>
regions set forth in SEQ ID NOs 37 to 42. Amino acid sequences are at least<br><br>
80% homologous if they have 80% identical amino acid residues in a like position"<br>
when the sequences are aligned optimally, gaps or insertions being counted as<br>
non-identical residues.<br>
Analogs may also arise as allelic variations. An "allelic variation or<br>
modification" is an alteration in the nucleic acid sequence. Such variations or<br>
modifications may be due to degeneracy in the genetic code or may be<br>
deliberately engineered to provide desired characteristics. These variations or<br>
modifications may or may not result in alterations in any encoded amino acid<br>
sequence.<br>
The term "effector agents" refers to non-protein carrier molecules to which<br>
the altered antibodies, and/or natural or synthetic light or heavy chains of the<br>
donor antibody or other fragments of the donor antibody may be associated by<br>
conventional means. Such non-protein carriers can include conventional carriers<br>
used in the diagnostic field, e.g., polystyrene or other plastic beads,<br>
polysaccharides, e.g., as used in the BIAcore [Pharmacia] system, or other non-<br>
protein substances useful in the medical field and safe for administration to<br>
humans and animals. Other effector agents may include a macrocycle, for<br>
chelating a heavy metal atom, or radioisotopes. Such effector agents may also<br>
be useful to increase the half-life of the altered antibodies, e.g., polyethylene<br>
glycol.<br>
Alternatively, one can construct antibodies, altered antibodies and<br>
fragments, by immunizing a non-human species (for example, bovine, ovine,<br>
monkey, chicken, rodent (e.g., murine and rat), etc.) to generate a desirable<br>
immunoglobulin upon presentation with native NOGO from any species against<br>
which antibodies cross react with human NOGO can be generated, eg human or<br>
chicken. Conventional hybridoma techniques are employed to provide a<br>
hybridoma cell line secreting a non-human mAb to NOGO. Such hybridomas are<br>
then screened for binding using NOGO coated to 384- or 96-well plates, with<br>
biotinylated NOGO bound to a streptavidin coated plate or in a homogenous<br>
europium-APC linked immunoassay using biotinylated NOGO.<br>
A native human antibody can be produced in a human antibody mouse<br>
such as the "Xenomouse™" (Abgenix) where the mouse immunoglobulin genes<br>
have been removed and genes encoding the human immunoglobulins have been<br><br>
inserted into the mouse chromosome. The mice are immunised as normal and<br>
develop an antibody reponse that is derived from the human genes. Thus the<br>
mouse produces human antibodies obviating the need to humanize the after<br>
selection of positive hybridomas. (See Green L.L, J Immunol Methods 1999 Dec<br>
10;231(1-2):11-23).<br>
The present invention also includes the use of Fab fragments or F(ab')2<br>
fragments derived from mAbs directed against NOGO. A Fab fragment contains<br>
the entire light chain and amino terminal portion of the heavy chain; and an<br>
F(ab')2 fragment is the fragment formed by two Fab fragments bound by disulfide<br>
bonds. Fab fragments and F(ab')2 fragments can be obtained by conventional<br>
means, e.g., cleavage of mAb w'rth the appropriate proteolytic enzymes, papain<br>
and/or pepsin, or by recombinant methods. The Fab and F(ab')2 fragments are<br>
useful themselves as therapeutic or prophylactic, and as donors of sequences<br>
including the variable regions and CDR sequences useful in the formation of<br>
recombinant or humanized antibodies as described herein.<br>
The Fab and F(ab')2 fragments can also be constructed via a<br>
combinatorial phage library (see, e.g., Winter et al.t Ann. Rev. Immunol., 12:433-<br>
455 (1994)) or via immunoglobulin chain shuffling (see, e.g., Marks et a!.,<br>
Bio/Technology, 10:779-783 (1992), which are both hereby incorporated by<br>
reference in their entirety.<br>
Thus human antibody fragments (Fv, scFv, Fab) specific for NOGO can be<br>
isolated using human antibody fragment phage display libraries. A library of<br>
bacteriophage particles, which display the human antibody fragment proteins, are<br>
panned against the NOGO protein. Those phage displaying antibody fragments<br>
that bind the NOGO are retained from the library and clonally amplified. The<br>
human antibody genes are then excised from the specific bacteriophage and<br>
inserted into human IgG expression constructs containing the human IgG<br>
constant regions to form the intact human IgG molecule with the variable regions<br>
from the isolated bacteriophage specific for NOGO.<br>
The donor antibodies may contribute sequences, such as variable heavy<br>
and/or light chain peptide sequences, framework sequences, CDR sequences,<br>
functional fragments, and analogs'thereof, and the nucleic acid sequences<br><br>
encoding them, useful in designing and obtaining various altered antibodies<br>
which are characterized by the antigen binding specificity of the donor antibody.<br>
Taking into account the degeneracy of the genetic code, various coding<br>
sequences may be constructed which encode the variable heavy and light chain<br>
amino acid sequences, and CDR sequences as well as functional fragments and<br>
analogs thereof which share the antigen specificity of the donor antibody.<br>
Isolated nucleic acid sequences, or fragments thereof, encoding the variable<br>
chain peptide sequences or CDRs can be used to produce altered antibodies,<br>
e.g., chimeric or humanized antibodies, or other engineered antibodies when<br>
operatively combined with a second immunoglobulin partner.<br>
Altered immunoglobulin molecules can encode altered antibodies which<br>
include engineered antibodies such as chimeric antibodies and humanized<br>
antibodies. A desired altered immunoglobulin coding region contains CDR-<br>
encoding regions that encode peptides having the antigen specificity of an anti-<br>
NOGO antibody, preferably a high affinity antibody, inserted into a first<br>
immunoglobulin partner (a human framework or human immunoglobulin variable<br>
region).<br>
Preferably, the first immunoglobulin partner is operatively linked to a<br>
second immunoglobulin partner. The second immunoglobulin partner is defined<br>
above, and may include a sequence encoding a second antibody region of<br>
interest, for example an Fc region. Second immunoglobulin partners may also<br>
include sequences encoding another immunoglobulin to which the light or heavy<br>
chain constant region is fused in frame or by means of a linker sequence.<br>
Engineered antibodies directed against functional fragments or analogs of NOGO<br>
may be designed to elicit enhanced binding.<br>
The second immunoglobulin partner may also be associated with effector<br>
agents as defined above, including non-protein carrier molecules, to which the<br>
second immunoglobulin partner may be operatively linked by conventional<br>
means.<br>
Fusion or linkage between the second immunoglobulin partners, e.g.,<br>
antibody sequences, and the effector agent may be by any suitable means, e.g.,<br>
by conventional covalent or ionic bonds,- protein fusions, or hetero-bifunctional<br>
cross-linkers, e.g., carbodiimide, glutaraldehyde, and the like. Such techniques<br><br>
are known in the art and readily described in conventional chemistry and<br>
biochemistry texts.<br>
Additionally, conventional linker sequences which simply provide for a<br>
desired amount of space between the second immunoglobulin partner and the<br>
effector agent may also be constructed into the altered immunoglobulin coding<br>
region. The design of such linkers is well known to those of skill in the art. In<br>
further aspects of the invention we provide diabodies (bivalent or bispecific),<br>
triabodies, tetrabodies and other multivalent scFV protein species having one or<br>
more CDRs as described supra that bind to and neutralise NOGO function.<br>
In still a further embodiment, the antibody of the invention may have<br>
attached to it an additional agent. For example, the procedure of recombinant<br>
DNA technology may be used to produce an engineered antibody of the invention<br>
in which the Fc fragment or CH2-CH3 domain of a full length antibody molecule<br>
has been replaced by an enzyme or other detectable molecule (i.e., a<br>
polypeptide effector or reporter molecule).<br>
The second immunoglobulin partner may also be operatively linked to a<br>
non-immunoglobulin peptide, protein or fragment thereof heterologous to the<br>
CDR-containing sequence having the antigen specificity of anti-NOGO antibody.<br>
The resulting protein may exhibit both anti-NOGO antigen specificity and<br>
characteristics of the non-immunoglobulin upon expression. That fusion partner<br>
characteristic may be, e.g., a functional characteristic such as another binding or<br>
receptor domain, or a therapeutic characteristic if the fusion partner is itself a<br>
therapeutic protein, or additional antigenic characteristics.<br>
Another desirable protein of this invention may comprise a full length<br>
antibody molecule, having full length heavy and light chains, or any discrete<br>
fragment thereof, such as the Fab or F(ab')2 fragments, a heavy chain dimer, or<br>
any minimal recombinant fragments thereof such as an Fv or a single-chain<br>
antibody (SCA) or any other molecule with the same specificity as the selected<br>
donor mAb. Such protein may be used in the form of an altered antibody, or may<br>
be used in its unfused form.<br>
Whenever the second immunoglobulin partner is derived from an antibody<br>
different from the donor antibody, e.g. any isotype or class of immunoglobulin<br>
framework or constant regions, an engineered antibody results. Engineered<br><br>
antibodies can comprise immunoglobulin (Ig) constant regions and variable<br>
framework regions from one source, e.g., the acceptor antibody, and one or more<br>
(preferably all) CDRs from the donor antibody. In addition, alterations, e.g.,<br>
deletions, substitutions, or additions, of the acceptor mAb light and/or heavy<br>
variable domain framework region at the nucleic acid or amino acid levels, or the<br>
donor CDR regions may be made in order to retain donor antibody antigen<br>
binding specificity.<br>
Such engineered antibodies are designed to employ one (or both) of the<br>
variable heavy and/or light chains of the anti-NOGO mAb or one or more of the<br>
heavy or light chain CDRs. The engineered antibodies may be neutralising, as<br>
above defined.<br>
Such engineered antibodies may include a humanized antibody containing<br>
the framework regions of a selected human immunoglobulin .or subtype, or a<br>
chimeric antibody containing the human heavy and light chain constant regions<br>
fused to the anti-NOGO antibody functional fragments. A suitable human (or<br>
other animal) acceptor antibody, may be one selected from a conventional<br>
database, e.g., the KABAT® database, Los Alamos database, and Swiss Protein<br>
database, by homology to the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the donor<br>
antibody. A human antibody characterized by a homology to the framework<br>
regions of the donor antibody (on an amino acid basis) may be suitable to<br>
provide a heavy chain constant region and/or a heavy chain variable framework<br>
region for insertion of the donor CDRs. A suitable acceptor antibody capable of<br>
donating light chain constant or variable framework regions may be selected in a<br>
similar manner. It should be noted that the acceptor antibody heavy and light<br>
chains are not required to originate from the same acceptor antibody.<br>
Desirably the heterologous framework and constant regions are selected<br>
from human immunoglobulin classes and isbtypes, such as IgG (subtypes 1<br>
through 4), lgM, IgA, and IgE. However, the acceptor antibody need not<br>
comprise only human immunoglobulin protein sequences. For instance a gene<br>
may be constructed in which a DNA sequence encoding part of a human<br>
immunoglobulin chain is fused to a DNA sequence encoding a non-<br>
immunoglobulin amino acid sequence such as a polypeptide effector or reporter<br>
molecule.<br><br>
Preferably, in a humanized antibody, the variable domains in both human<br>
heavy and light chains have been engineered by one or more CDR<br>
replacements. It is possible to use all six CDRs, or various combinations of less<br>
than the six CDRs. Preferably all six CDRs are replaced. It is possible to replace<br>
the CDRs only in the human heavy chain, using as light chain the unmodified<br>
light chain from the human acceptor antibody. Alternatively, a compatible light<br>
chain may be selected from another human antibody by recourse to the<br>
conventional antibody databases. The remainder of the engineered antibody<br>
may be derived from any suitable acceptor human immunoglobulin.<br>
The engineered humanized antibody thus preferably has the structure of a<br>
natural human antibody or a fragment thereof, and possesses the combination of<br>
properties required for effective therapeutic use.<br>
It will be understood by those skilled in the art that an engineered antibody<br>
may be further modified by changes in variable domain amino acids without<br>
necessarily affecting the specificity and high affinity of the donor antibody (i.e., an<br>
analog). It is anticipated that heavy and light chain amino acids may be<br>
substituted by other amino acids either in the variable domain frameworks or<br>
CDRs or both.<br>
In addition, the constant region may be altered to enhance or decrease<br>
selective properties of the molecules of the instant invention. For example,<br>
dimerization, binding to Fc receptors, or the ability to bind and activate<br>
complement (see, e.g., Angal et al., Mol. Immunol, 30:105-108 (1993), Xu et al.,<br>
J. Biol. Chem, 269:3469-3474 (1994), Winter et al., EP 307,434-B).<br>
An altered antibody which is a chimeric antibody differs from the<br>
humanized antibodies described above by providing the entire non-human donor<br>
antibody heavy chain and light chain variable regions, including framework<br>
regions, in association with immunoglobulin constant regions from other species,<br>
preferably human for both chains.<br>
Preferably, the variable light and/or heavy chain sequences and the CDRs<br>
of suitable donor mAbs, and their encoding nucleic acid sequences, are utilized<br>
in the construction of altered antibodies, preferably humanized antibodies, of this<br>
invention, by the following process. The same or similar techniques may also be<br>
employed to generate other embodiments of this invention.<br><br>
A hybridoma producing a selected donor mAb is conventionally cloned,<br>
and the DNA of its heavy and light chain variable regions obtained by techniques<br>
known to one of skill in the art, e.g., the techniques described in Sambrook et al.,<br>
(Molecular Cloning (A Laboratory Manual), 2nd edition, Cold Spring Harbor<br>
Laboratory (1989)). The variable heavy and light regions containing at least the<br>
CDR-encoding regions and those portions of the acceptor mAb light and/or heavy<br>
variable domain framework regions required in order to retain donor mAb binding<br>
specificity, as well as the remaining immunoglobulin-derived parts of the antibody<br>
chain derived from a human immunoglobulin are obtained using polynucleotide<br>
primers arid reverse transcriptase. The CDR-encoding regions are identified<br>
using a known database and by comparison to other antibodies.<br>
A mouse/human chimeric antibody may then be prepared and assayed for<br>
binding ability. Such a chimeric antibody contains the entire non-human donor<br>
antibody VH and VL regions, in association with human Ig constant regions for<br>
both chains.<br>
Homologous framework regions of a heavy chain variable region from a<br>
human antibody may be identified using computerized databases, e.g., KABAT®,<br>
and a human antibody having homology to the donor antibody will be selected as<br>
the acceptor antibody. A suitable light chain variable framework region can be<br>
designed in a similar manner.<br>
A humanized antibody may be derived from the chimeric antibody, or<br>
preferably, made synthetically by inserting the donor mAb CDR-encoding regions<br>
from the heavy and light chains appropriately within the selected heavy and light<br>
chain framework. Alternatively, a humanized antibody can be made using<br>
standard mutagenesis techniques. Thus, the resulting humanized antibody<br>
contains human framework regions and donor mAb CDR-encoding regions.<br>
There may be subsequent manipulation of framework residues. The resulting<br>
humanized antibody can be expressed in recombinant host cells, e.g., COS,<br>
CHO or myeloma cells.<br>
A conventional expression vector or recombinant plasmid is produced by<br>
placing these coding sequences for the antibody in operative association with<br>
conventional regulatory control sequences capable of controlling the replication<br>
and expression in, and/or secretion from, a host cell. Regulatory sequences<br><br>
include promoter sequences, e.g., CMV promoter, and signal sequences, which<br>
can be derived from other known antibodies. Similarly, a second expression<br>
vector can be produced having a DNA sequence which encodes a<br>
complementary antibody light or heavy chain. Preferably this second expression<br>
vector is identical to the first except insofar as the coding sequences and<br>
selectable markers are concerned, so to ensure as far as possible that each<br>
polypeptide chain is functionally expressed. Alternatively, the heavy and light<br>
chain coding sequences for the altered antibody may reside on a single vector.<br>
A selected host cell is co-transfected by conventional techniques with both<br>
the first and second vectors (or simply transfected by a single vector) to create<br>
the transfected host cell of the invention comprising both the recombinant or<br>
synthetic light and heavy chains. The transfected cell is then cultured by<br>
conventional techniques to produce the engineered antibody of the invention.<br>
The antibody which includes the association of both the recombinant heavy chain<br>
and/or light chain is screened from culture by appropriate assay, such as ELISA<br>
or R1A. Similar conventional techniques may be employed to construct other<br>
altered antibodies and molecules.<br>
Suitable vectors for the cloning and subcloning steps employed in the<br>
methods and construction of the compositions of this invention may be selected<br>
by one of skill in the art. For example, the conventional pUC series of cloning<br>
vectors may be used. One vector, pUC19, is commercially available from supply<br>
houses, such as Amersham (Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom) or Pharmacia<br>
(Uppsala, Sweden). Additionally, any vector which is capable of replicating<br>
readily, has an abundance of cloning sites and selectable genes (e.g., antibiotic<br>
resistance), and is easily manipulated may be used for cloning. Thus, the<br>
selection of the cloning vector is not a limiting factor in this invention.<br>
Similarly, the vectors employed for expression of the antibodies may be<br>
selected by one of skill in the art from any conventional vector. The vectors also<br>
contain selected regulatory sequences (such as CMV or RSV promoters) which<br>
direct the replication and expression of heterologous DNA sequences in selected<br>
host cells. These vectors contain the above described DNA sequences which<br>
code for the antibody or altered immunoglobulin coding region. In addition, the<br><br>
vectors may incorporate the selected immunoglobulin sequences modified by the'<br>
insertion of desirable restriction sites for ready manipulation.<br>
The expression vectors may also be characterized by genes suitable for<br>
amplifying expression of the heterologous DNA sequences, e.g., the mammalian<br>
dihydrofolate reductase gene (DHFR). Other preferable vector sequences<br>
include a poly A signal sequence, such as from bovine growth hormone (BGH)<br>
and the betaglobin promoter sequence (betaglopro). The expression vectors<br>
useful herein may be synthesized by techniques'well known to those skilled in<br>
this art.<br>
The components of such vectors, e.g. replicons, selection genes,<br>
enhancers, promoters, signal sequences and the like, may be obtained from<br>
commercial or natural sources or synthesized by known procedures for use in<br>
directing the expression and/or secretion of the product of the recombinant DNA<br>
in a selected host. Other appropriate expression vectors of which numerous<br>
types are known in the art for mammalian, bacterial, insect, yeast, and fungal<br>
expression may also be selected for this purpose.<br>
The present invention also encompasses a cell line transfected with a<br>
recombinant plasmid containing the coding sequences of the antibodies or<br>
altered immunoglobulin molecules thereof. Host cells useful for the cloning and<br>
other manipulations of these cloning vectors are also conventional. However,<br>
most desirably, cells from various strains of E. coli are used for replication of the<br>
cloning vectors and other steps in the construction of altered antibodies of this<br>
invention.<br>
Suitable host cells or cell lines for the expression of the antibody of the<br>
invention are preferably mammalian cells such as NSO, Sp2/0, CHO (e.g. DG44),<br>
COS, a fibroblast cell (e.g., 3T3), and myeloma cells, and more preferably a CHO<br>
or a myeloma cell. Human cells may be used, thus enabling the molecule to be<br>
modified with human glycosylation patterns. Alternatively, other eukaryotic cell<br>
lines may be employed. The selection of suitable mammalian host cells and<br>
methods for transformation, culture, amplification, screening and product<br>
production and purification are known in the art. See, e.g., Sambrook et al., cited<br>
above.<br><br>
Bacterial cells may prove useful as host cells suitable for the expression of"<br>
the recombinant Fabs of the present invention (see, e.g., PlQckthun, A., Immunol.<br>
Rev., 130:151-188 (1992)). However, due to the tendency of proteins expressed<br>
in bacterial cells to be in an unfolded or improperly folded form or in a non-<br>
glycosylated form, any recombinant Fab produced in a bacterial cell would have<br>
to be screened for retention of antigen binding ability. If the molecule expressed<br>
by the bacterial cell was produced in a properly folded form, that bacterial cell<br>
would be a desirable host. For example, various strains of E. coli used for<br>
expression are well-known as host cells in the field of biotechnology. Various<br>
strains of B. subtilis, Streptomyces, other bacilli and the like may also be<br>
employed in this method.<br>
Where desired, strains of yeast cells known to those skilled in the art are<br>
also available as host cells, as well as insect cells, e.g. Drosophila and<br>
Lepidoptera and viral expression systems. See, e.g. Miller et al., Genetic<br>
Engineering, 8:277-298, Plenum Press (1986) and references cited therein.<br>
The general methods by which the vectors may be constructed, the<br>
transfection methods required to produce the host cells of the invention, and<br>
culture methods necessary to produce the antibody of the invention from such<br>
host cell are all conventional techniques. Typically, the culture method of the<br>
present invention is a serum-free culture method, usually by culturing cells<br>
serum-free in suspension. Likewise, once produced, the antibodies of the<br>
invention may be purified from the cell culture contents according to standard<br>
procedures of the art, including ammonium sulfate precipitation, affinity columns,<br>
column chromatography, gel electrophoresis and the like. Such techniques are<br>
within the skill of the art and do not limit this invention. For example, preparation<br>
of altered antibodies are described in WO 99/58679 and WO 96/16990.<br>
Yet another method of expression of the antibodies may utilize, expression<br>
in a transgenic animal, such as described in U. S. Patent No. 4,873,316. This<br>
relates to an expression system using the animal's casein promoter which when<br>
transgenically incorporated into a mammal permits the female to produce the<br>
desired recombinant protein in its milk.<br>
In a further aspect of the invention there is provided a method of producing<br>
an antibody of the invention which method comprises the step of culturing a host<br><br>
cell transformed or transfected w'rth a vector encoding the light and/or heavy<br>
chain of the antibody of the invention and recovering the antibody thereby<br>
produced.<br>
In accordance with the present invention there is provided a method of .<br>
producing an anti-NOGO antibody which specifically binds to and neutralises the<br>
activity of human NOGO-A which method comprises the steps of;<br>
(a)	providing a first vector encoding a heavy chain of the antibody; .<br>
(b)	providing a second vector encoding the light chain of the antibody;<br>
(c)	tranforming a mammalian host cell (e.g. CHO) with said first and<br>
second vectors;<br>
(d)	culturing the host cell of step (c) under conditions conducive to the<br>
secretion of the antibody from said host cell into said culture media;<br>
(e)	recovering the secreted antibody of step (d).<br>
Once expressed by the desired method, the antibody is then examined for<br>
in vitro activity by use of an appropriate assay. Presently conventional ELISA<br>
assay formats are employed to assess qualitative and quantitative binding of the<br>
antibody to NOGO. Additionally, other in vitro assays may also be used to verify<br>
neutralizing efficacy prior to subsequent human clinical studies performed to<br>
evaluate the persistence of the antibody in the body despite the usual clearance<br>
mechanisms.<br>
The therapeutic agents of this invention may be administered as a<br>
prophylactic or following the stroke event/on-set of clinical symptoms, or as<br>
otherwise needed. The dose and duration of treatment relates to the relative<br>
duration of the molecules of the present invention in the human circulation, and<br>
can be adjusted by one of skill in the art depending upon the condition being<br>
treated and the general health of the patient. It is envisaged that repeated dosing<br>
(e.g. once a week or once every two weeks) over an extended time period (e.g.<br>
four to six months) maybe required to achieve maximal therapeutic efficacy.<br>
The mode of administration of the therapeutic agent of the invention may<br>
be any suitable route which delivers the agent to the host. The antagonists and<br>
antibodies, and pharmaceutical compositions of the invention are particularly<br>
useful for parenteral administration, i.e., subcutaneously, intrathecally,<br><br>
intraperitoneally, intramuscularly, intravenously, or intranasally, of which<br>
intravenously is particularly preferred.<br>
Therapeutic agents of the invention may be prepared as pharmaceutical<br>
compositions containing an effective amount of the antagonist or antibody of the<br>
invention as an active ingredient in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In the<br>
prophylactic agent of the invention, an aqueous suspension or solution containing<br>
the engineered antibody, preferably buffered at physiological pH, in a form ready<br>
for injection is preferred. The compositions for parenteral administration will<br>
commonly comprise a solution of the antagonist or antibody of the invention or a<br>
cocktail thereof dissolved in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, preferably an<br>
aqueous carrier. A variety of aqueous carriers may be employed, e.g., 0.9%<br>
saline, 0.3% glycine, and the like. These solutions are sterile and generally free<br>
of particulate matter. These solutions may be sterilized by conventional, well<br>
known sterilization techniques (e.g., filtration). The compositions may contain<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable auxiliary substances as required to approximate<br>
physiological conditions such as pH adjusting and buffering agents, etc. The<br>
concentration of the antagonist or antibody of the invention in such<br>
pharmaceutical formulation can vary widely, i.e., from less than about 0.5%,<br>
usually at or at least about 1 % to as much as 15 or 20% by weight and will be<br>
selected primarily based on fluid volumes, viscosities, etc., according, to the<br>
particular mode of administration selected.<br>
Thus, a pharmaceutical composition of the invention for intramuscular<br>
injection could be prepared to contain 1 ml_ sterile buffered water, and between<br>
about 1 ng to about 100 mg, e.g. about 50 ng to about 30 mg or more preferably,<br>
about 5 mg to about 25 mg, of an antagonist or antibody of the invention.<br>
Similarly, a pharmaceutical composition of the invention for intravenous Infusion<br>
could be made up to contain about 250 ml of sterile Ringer's solution, and about<br>
1 to about 30 and preferably 5 mg to about 25 mg of an engineered antibody of<br>
the invention. Actual methods for preparing parenterally administrable<br>
compositions are well known or will be apparent to those skilled in the art and are<br>
described in more detail in, for example, Remington's Pharmaceutical Science,<br>

It is preferred that the therapeutic agent of the invention, when in a<br>
pharmaceutical preparation, be present in unit dose forms. The appropriate<br>
therapeutically effective dose can be determined readily by those of skill in the<br>
art. To effectively treat stroke and other neurological diseases in a human, one<br>
dose of up to 700 mg per 70 kg body weight of an antagonist or antibody of this<br>
invention should be administered parenterally, preferably i.v. or i.m.<br>
(intramuscularly). Such dose may, if necessary, be repeated at appropriate time<br>
intervals selected as appropriate by a physician. As disclosed in the examples,<br>
the present inventors have been able to demonstrate a positive effect on<br>
functional recovery in the rat model therein when antibodies of the invention were<br>
administered intravenously.<br>
The antibodies described herein can be lyophilized for storage and<br>

As used herein, the term "functional recovery" refers to a motor and/or sensory<br>
and/or behavioural improvement in a subject following e.g. an ischemic event or<br>
injury or on-set of clinical symptoms. Functional recovery in humans may be<br>
evaluated by instruments designed to measure elemental neurological functions<br>
such as motor strength, sensation and coordination, cognitive functions such as<br>
memory, language and the ability to follow directions, and functional capacities<br>
such as basic activities of daily living or instrumental activities. Recovery of<br>
elemental neurological function can be measured with instruments such as the<br>
NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS), recovery of cognitive function can be measured with<br>
neuropsychological tests such as Boston Naming Test, Trail-making Tests, and<br>
California Verbal Learning Test, and activities of daily living may be measured<br>
with instruments such as the ADCS/ADL (Alzheimer's Disease Clinical<br>
Studies/Activities of Daily Living) scale or the Bristol Activities of Daily Living<br>
Scale, all tests and scales known in the art.<br><br>
The following examples illustrate but do not limit the invention.<br>
Exemplification.<br>
Example 1 - Preparation and selection of the hvbridomas<br>
Anti-NOGO monoclonal antibodies are produced by hybridoma cells, the<br>
result of the fusion of mouse myeloma cells with B lymphocytes from mice<br>
immunised with the target antigen. The hybridoma cell is immortalised by the<br>
myeloma fusion partner while the capacity to produce antibodies is provided by<br>
the B lymphocyte. Each hybridoma cell makes only one individual antibody with<br>
unique specificity hence the term monoclonal.<br>
SJL mice were immunised with 10ug total protein (1:1, human NOGO-A<br>
splice (amino acids 186-1004) and rat NOGO-A splice (amino acids 173-975),<br>
produced as GST-fusion proteins in E.Coli BL21) using both CFA and RIBI<br>
adjuvants subcutaneously. The mice were then boosted with 5ug of the same<br>
proteins using RIBI adjuvant after 4 and 8 days. After a further 3 days, immune<br>
cells were harvested from the locally draining lymph nodes and fused with mouse<br>
myeloma cells using PEG1500 to generate hybridomas. Individual hybridoma cell<br>
lines were cloned by two rounds of limiting dilution. By immunising the mice with<br>
both human and rat NOGO-A, antibodies may be raised that have good binding<br>
specificity and/or binding affinity for both rat as well as human NOGQ-A. This in<br>
turn enables evaluation of such antibodies in rat and/or rodent models prior to<br>
administration to a human.<br>
Initial hybridoma antibody selection was on the basis of direct binding to<br>
the NOGO protein(s) on microtitre plates. Subsequently approximately 60<br>
hybridomas were selected based on the ability of soluble protein (consisting of<br>
human NOGO-A sequence cleaved from the GST moiety using Prescission™<br>
protease) to compete for this binding activity in ELISA assays.<br><br>
Example 2 - Cloning of the variable regions<br>
Total RNA was extracted from the selected 2A10/3,2C4/1.and 15C3/3<br>
hybridoma cells followed by reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction<br>
(RT-PCR) to extract heavy and light variable-domain cDNA sequence. The<br>
forward primer for RT-PCR was a mixture of degenerate primers specific for<br>
murine immunoglobulin gene leader-sequences and the reverse primer was an<br>
isotype-specific antibody directed to the constant regions. PCR primers were<br>
designed to carry 5' restriction enzyme recognition sites to enable cloning into<br>
pUC19 for DNA sequencing.<br>
RNA extraction<br>
Total RNA was extracted from pellets of 106 cells of each hybridoma clone using<br>
the SV Total RNA Isolation System from Promega according to manufacturer's<br>
instructions.<br>
Reverse transcription<br>
RNA was reverse transcribed to produce cDNA of the variable heavy and light<br>
domains using forward primers specific for the murine leader sequences and<br>
reverse primers to murine IgGK constant regions. The IgGyl reverse primer was<br>
used for hybridomas 2C4/1 and 15C3/3; and the lgGy2b for 2A10/3. Forward<br>
primers carry a Sail restriction enzyme recognition site at the 5' end, with four<br>
extra nucleotides added 5'to this for efficient restriction digestion. These primers<br>
were adapted from Jones ST and Bendig MM 1991 (Biotechnology 9, 88-89).<br>
Reverse primers carry a Xmal restriction enzyme recognition site plus and extra<br>
four nucleotides at the 5' ends.<br>

pUC19 cloning<br>
The variable region RT-PCR products were purified using a Qiagen MinElute<br>
Qiagen PCR Purifcation kit according to their instructions and digested<br>
sequentially with Xmal and Sail from New England Biolabs according to<br>
manufacture's instructions. They were then loaded on a preparative 1% agarose<br>
gel containing 0.5% ethidium bromide and run in TAE buffer at 50mA for 1hour<br>
and the V region bands excised under ultra-violet light. The DNA fragments were<br>
purified from the gel using the MinElute Gel extraction kit from Qiagen according<br>
to manufacturer's instructions. pUC19 vector arms were prepared by digesting<br>
pUC19 with Sail and Xmal, then purified using the MinElute Reaction Clean up<br>
kit from Qiagen and dephosphorylated using Shrimp alkaline phosphatase (USB)<br>
according to the manufacturer's instructions. The concentration of the vector<br>
arms and the V-region fragments was estimated from an analytical 1%<br>
agarose/ethidium bromide gel, mixed in a molar ratio of 1:2 and ligated using<br>
Promega's Quick Ligation kit acording to the manufacturer's instructions.<br>
Ligated plasmids were transformed into DH5a cells (Invitrogen) according<br>
manufacturer's instructions. Colonies which grew on L-agar plates containing<br>
100ng/ml ampicillin were selected for DNA sequence analysis.<br><br>

Colonies were cultured overnight at 37°C in 5ml LB medium supplemented with<br>
100p.g/ml ampiciilin and plasmid DNAwas extracted and purified using the<br>
Qiagen QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit according to manufacturer's instructions. The<br>
VH and V|_ regions were DNA sequenced using standard M13 forward and<br>
reverse primers.<br>
The results of the sequencing determination are shown as SEQ ID NOs 43 to 48.<br>
Example 3 - Recombinant anti-NOGO antibodies<br>
Recombinant antibodies having murine 2a/k constant regions could be purified<br>
from cells transfected with plasrhids comprising the light and heavy variable<br>
regions cloned onto mouse lgG2a/k constant region gene segments. The cloned<br>
murine V regions were amplified by PCR to introduce restriction sites required for<br>
cloning into mammalian expression vectors Rid and Rln. Hind III and Spe I sites<br>
were designed in frame with the VH domain to allow cloning into a modified Rid<br>
vector containing the mouse v2a constant region. Hind III and BsiW I sites were<br>
designed in frame the VL domain and allow cloning into a modified Rln vector<br>
containing the mouse K constant region.<br>

Example 4 - Mouse anti-NOGO antibody binds to NOGO<br>
GST-human NOGO-A56 at 5ug/ml in 50mM Tris pH9.5 was coated onto<br>
Nunc Immunosorp plates (100ul per well) at 4 °C overnight. Wells were rinsed<br>
once with PBS then incubated with 1% BSA in PBS to block non-specific binding<br>
sites at room temperature for 1hour. Antibodies were diluted in PBS to 2ug/ml<br>
and 1/3 dilutions made from this. Antibodies were added to wells in triplicate and<br>
incubated at 4C overnight. Wells were washed three times with PBS then<br>
incubated with Anti-Mouse-HRP (1:1000) for 1hour. Washed five times with PBS<br>
and then incubated with 100ul TMB substrate (Sigma) per well for 10 minutes.<br>
The colour reaction was stopped by the addition of 50ul concentrated HCI.<br>
Optical density at 450nm was measured using a plate reader. Background values<br>
read from wells with no antibody were subtracted.<br>
Figures 8 shows the dose-dependent binding of all three mouse anti-<br>
NOGO-A monoclonal antibodies, 2A10,2C4 and 15C3, to human NOGO-A56 in<br>
an ELISA assay.<br>
The Y-axis shows the measured optical density (OD) at 450nm, a quantitative<br>
measure of antibody captured in the wells. The X-axis shows the concentration of<br>
antibody used (ng/ml) per well at each data point. Antibody 2A10 shows the<br>
highest signal at a range of concentrations suggestive of a higher affinity for<br>
human NOGO-A.<br>

MLVKESLTETSFESMIEYENKE - SEQ.I.D.NO:87) of human NOGO-A was cloned<br>
into the BamHl-Xhol sites of pGEX-6P1 to generate a GST-tagged fusion protein<br>
designated NOGO-A56. Plasmid was expressed in BL21 cells in 2XTY medium<br>
with 100ug/ml ampicillin following induction with IPTG to 0.5mM at 37C for<br>
3hours. Cell pellets were lysed by sonication and the fusion protein purified using<br>
Glutathione-sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia) following manufacturers<br>
instructions. Purified protein was eluted using reduced glutathione and<br>
extensively dialysed against PBS, quantitated using BSA standards and a<br>
BioRad coomassie based protein assay and then stored in aliquots at -80C.<br>
Thus the present invention provides an antibody or functional fragment thereof<br>
which binds to NOGO-A, particularly human NOGO-A wherein said antibody or<br>
functional fragment thereof neutralises the activity of a NOGO protein comprising<br>
the polypeptide encoded by SEQ.I.D.NO:87 wherein said antibody binds to<br>
SEQ.I.D.NO:87 of said protein. In typical forms, antibodies of the invention bind<br>
between amino acids 586-785 of human NOGO-A and neutralise the activity of<br>
NOGO-A.<br>
Example 6 - Neurite-outqrowth Assay<br>
Control GST only or GST-NOGOA56 fusion proteins were thawed on ice and<br>
diluted in 0.5x tissue culture grade PBS to 3pmol/ul. 5ul spots were dried onto the<br>
centre of each well of BD-Biocoat poly-d-lysine coated 96 well plates in the<br>
tissue-culture cabinet. Once dried, purified antibodies, hybridoma conditioned<br>
tissue-culture supernatant or compounds were diluted in HBSS (Life<br>
Technologies) and 50ul applied to wells in replicates of between 4 and 8 wells.<br>
Control wells of GST alone and GST-NOGO-A56 were treated with HBSS without<br>
supplements. After 2 hours pretreatment at 37C purified, dissociated cerebellar<br>
granule neurons from post-natal day 8 rat brains were added at 20-40,000<br>
neurons per well in a volume of 10Oul and incubated at 37C for 24 hours.<br>
Cultures were fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde/10% sucrose in PBS for 1 hour<br>
then neurites were stained using a polyclonal anti-beta-lll-tubulin antibody.<br><br>
Neurite-outgrowth was quantitated using automated image capture and analysis<br>
on the Cellomics Arrayscan system.<br>
The results are shown in figures 1 to 6.<br>
Figure 1 shows the inhibitory effect of NOGO-A56 on neurite outgrowth<br>
compared with the control protein GST alone.<br>
Figures 2 through 5 show the identification of function-blocking anti-NOGO<br>
antibodies 2A10/3, 2C4/1 and 15C3/3 together with a non-function blocking<br>
control antibody 12G3. Antibody 12G3 binds to NOG056 but does not inhibit<br>
neurite outgrowth activity. The graphs show the average neurite length in<br>
cultures exposed to unpurified antibodies (in supematants). The data shows the<br>
blocking effect of 2A10/3,2C4/1 and 15C3/3 of the neurite outgrowth inhibitory<br>
activity of NOGO-A56. The control is GST alone.<br>
Figure 6 shows the blocking of the neurite outgrowth inhibitory effect of NOGO-<br>
A56 by purified 2A10/3.<br>
Example 7 - IN-1 has no blocking activity against human NOGO<br>
The neurite outgrowth assay as described in example 5, when carried out with<br>
the IN-1 antibody, shows that IN-1 does not block the inhibitory activity of human<br>
NOGO-A {figure 7).<br>
Example 8 - Humanisation of 2A10<br>
Humanised VH and VL constructs were prepared de novo by build up of<br>
overlapping oligonucleotides including restriction sites for cloning into Rid and<br>
Rln mammalian expression vectors as well as a human signal sequence. Hind 111<br>
and Spe I restriction sites were introduced to frame the VH domain containing the<br>
CAMPATH-1H signal sequence for cloning into Rid containing the human y1<br>
mutated constant region. Hind III and BsiW I restriction sites were introduced to<br>
frame the VL domain containing the CAMPATH-1H signal sequence for cloning<br>
into Rln containing the human kappa constant region.<br><br>

(SEQ.I.D.NO:86)<br>
Plasmids encoding SEQ.!.D.NO:84 and 86 were transiently co-transfected into<br>
CHO cells and expressed at small scale to produce antibody H1L11. Plasmids<br>
encoding SEQ.I.D.NO:92 and 86 may also be transiently co-transfected into CHO<br>
cells and expressed at small scale to produce antibody H7L11.<br>
Thus the invention provides a humanised antibody that binds to and neutralises<br>
the activity of NOGO, particularly human NOGO, more particularly human<br>
NOGO-A, which humanised antibody comprises a heavy chain variable region of<br>
SEQ.I.D.NO:84 and a light chain variable region of SEQ.I.D.NO:86. In a further<br>
aspect of the invention there is provided an antibody (particularly a fully human or<br>
humanised antibody) that binds to and neutralises the activity of NOGO,<br>
particularly human NOGO, more particularly human NOGO-A, which antibody<br>
competitively inhibits the binding of the humanised antibody comprising a heavy<br>
chain variable region of SEQ.I.D.NO:85 and a light chain variable region of<br>
SEQ.I.D.NO:86, at equimolar concentration, to human NOGO-A. Preferably the<br>
competing antibody inhibits at least 50% of the binding of the antibody<br>
comprising a heavy chain variable region of SEQ.I.D.NO:85 and light chain<br>
variable region of SEQ.I.D.NO:86 to human NOGO-A.<br>
In accordance with the present invention there is provided an anti-NOGO<br>
antibody which specifically binds to and neutralises the activity of human NOGO-<br>
A which antibody comprises a heavy chain of SEQ.l.D.NO:88 and a light chain of<br>
SEQ.I.D.NO:89. The present invention also concerns pharmaceutical<br>
compositions comprising said antibody and methods of treating a human patient,<br>
particularly a patient afflicted with stroke (such as Ischemic stroke) or Alzheimer's<br>
disease. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that SEQ.I.D.NO:88 and<br>
SEQ.I.D.NO:89 represent the heavy chain and light chain respectively prior to<br>
any processing (e.g. host cell mediated processing) for removal of a signal<br><br>
sequence. Typically the processed form of SEQ.I.D.NO:88 will begin at position<br>
20 and the processed form of SEQ.I.D.NO:89 will begin at position 20.<br><br><br><br>
Example 9 - BiaCore Analysis of H1L11 Anti NOGO Monoclonal Antibody<br>
The binding kinetics of the anti-NOGO monoclonal antibody (mAb) to<br>
recombinantly expressed human NOGO-A (hNOGO) was analysed using the<br>
Biacore3000 biosensor. The methodology was as followed:<br><br>
Method<br>
hNOGO was immobilised to a CM5 chip by primary amine coupling using<br>
the Biacore Wizard program designed for targeted immobilisation levels. The<br>
CM5 sensor surface was activated by passing a solution of 50mM N-hydroxy-<br>
succinimide (NHS) and 200mM N-ethyl-N'-dimethylaminopropyi carbonide<br>
(EDC). Then using a 300nM solution of hNOGO in 5mM sodium acetate, pH5.0,<br>
a range of concentrations between 50-200 resonance units of hNOGO were<br>
immobilised. After immobilisation was complete any still activated esters were<br>
blocked by an injection of 1M ethanolamine hydrochloride, pH8.5.<br>
The H1L11 mAb (see example 8) was diluted down in HBS-EP (10mM<br>
HEPES, pH 7.4, 150mM NaCl, 3mM EDTA, and 0.005% P-20 surfactant) and<br>
binding studies were carried out at concentrations ranging between 0.1-100nM.<br>
For kinetic analysis a flowrate of 60µl/minute was used, with no mass transfer<br>
effects seen. All concentrations were performed in duplicate, in a random order<br>
with buffer blanks included. Regeneration was achieved either by the single<br>
injection of a 15µl pulse of 50mM sodium hydroxide alone or the injection of 15µl<br>
of 100mM H3PO4, followed by a subsequent injection of 15µl of 50mM sodium<br>
hydroxide. Both regeneration protocols were run at a flowrate of 30µl/minute; and<br>
both methods resulted in the complete removal of bound H1L11 but did not result<br>
in any loss of binding capacity of the hNOGO sensor surface. All runs were<br>
referenced against a blanked sensor surface (one that had been activated and<br>
blocked as described earlier but had no addition of ligand). Analysis of binding<br>
was carried out using the BlAevaluation kinetic analysis software version 4.1.<br>
Biacore analysis of other antibodies of the invention essentially followed the<br>
same protocol as described herein.<br><br><br><br>
Example 10 - Effect of anti-NOGO antibody (2C4) on lesion volume and<br>
functional recovery following tMCAO.<br>
Aim:<br>
The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of an anti-NOGO monoclonal<br>
antibody (mab) dosed intracerebnoventricularly (ICV) on lesion volume and<br>
functional recovery of rats post transient middle cerebral artery occlusion<br>
(tMCAO). Cylinder test, tapered beam and neurological score tasks were utilised<br>
to assess long term functional recovery following 90 minutes of transient .<br>
ischaemia and brains were harvested for immunohistochemistry evaluation of<br>
regenerative processes and lesion volume assessment.<br>
■ Methods:<br>
Surgical Preparation<br><br>
Male Sprague-Dawley rats (300-350g) supplied by Charles River, were used in<br>
the study. Intra-cerebral ventricular (i.c.v.) cannulae were positioned in the left<br>
lateral cerebral ventricle under general anaesthesia. Following at least 4 days<br>
recovery from surgery, cannulae placement was confirmed by challenge with<br>
Angiotensin II administered ICV.<br>
Induction of Focal Ischaemia<br>
All animals underwent tMCAO under halothane/oxygen/nitrous oxide anaesthesia<br>
as described by Longa and co-workers (Stroke, 1989,20, 84-91). Body<br>
temperature was monitored throughout the surgical procedure by a rectal<br>
thermometer, and the animals were maintained normothermic (37 + 0.50C) via a<br>
heating blanket controlled by the thermometer. Actual core temperature values<br>
were recorded at the time of left middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion and at<br>
reperfusion.<br>
Ninety minutes after MCA occlusion, the rats were re-anaesthetised and the<br>
filament slowly and completely withdrawn to allow reperfusion. The arteriotomy<br>
is closed with diathermy, haemostasis was re-checked, and the cervical wound<br>
sutured closed.<br>
Post-Occlusion Recovery<br>
Following MCA occlusion, anaesthesia was discontinued and the animals<br>
allowed to regain consciousness and righting reflex under strict observation in an<br>
incubator (23-25 °C) for 1 hour. The animals were then housed individually in the<br>
post-operative recovery room, where their overall health status was closely<br>
monitored throughout the survival period.<br>
Behavioural Tasks:<br>
1. Neurological Assessment:<br><br>
Motor and behavioural changes following MCA occlusion were assessed using a<br>
28 point grading scale at time points 1 hour, 24 hours and then weekly for 8<br>
weeks after MCA occlusion.<br>
Details of Neurological assessment ("neuroscore") used:<br>
Neuroscore of MCAO animals when compared to other rats within the same<br>
study - Maximum score 28 points.<br>
Paw placement<br>
Hold the animal lengthways at the edge of bench, cupping your hand over its<br>
head, and, one by one, take each paw and place it over the edge of the bench.<br>
Watch for paw retraction, and placement back on the bench.<br>
Score: 1 for each successful paw placement (Max score=4)<br>
Righting Reflex<br>
Grasp the animal firmly, and rotate it until it is lying on its back in the palm of your<br>
hand. Release grip and see if the animal rights itself<br>
Score: 1 for successful righting<br>
Horizontal Bar<br>

1 if animal just hangs<br>
0 if animal falls off (due to lack of grip)<br><br>
Inclined Platform<br>
Hold cage lid at 45°. Place animal 'downhill' on the lid<br>
Score: 3 if the animal rotates to face 'uphill' within 15 seconds<br>
2 if it takes 15-30 seconds<br>
1 if it takes longer than 30 seconds<br>
0 if the animal falls off the lid due to weak/absent grip, or remains pointing<br>
'downhill'<br>
Contralateral Rotation<br>
Hold the animal by the base of the tail and rotate the animal clockwise then<br>
anticlockwise. Watch for the animal's ability to swivel up contralaterally to the<br>
direction of rotation<br>
Score: 1 for each side (Max score=2)<br>
Visual Fore-paw Reaching<br>
Hold the animal by the base of the tail with its head just below the level of the<br>
bench top. Approach the bench until the animal's vibrissae are almost touching it.<br>
The animal should arch and attempt to place its forepaws on the bench surface.<br>
Score: 1 for each successful paw placement (Max score=2)<br>
Circling<br>
Place the animal on the floor and look for circling<br>
Score: . 4 for non-circling<br>

2	- Very good but weight gain less than normal<br>
1	- good<br><br>
0 -fair (e.g. dirty coat, may not be grooming much, hunched<br>
posture, aggressive, weak muscle tone)<br>
Maximum score (i.e. normal rat) =28<br>
2.	Cylinder test:<br>
Animals were assessed weekly in the cylinder test of forepaw placement.<br>
Animals were placed inside a transparent Perspex® cylinder 20cm in diameter<br>
and 30 cm tall for a 3 minute period. The numbers of left and right forepaw<br>
placements are assessed in this period. This test was conducted in red light<br>
conditions.<br>
3.	Tapered beam walking:<br>
For this test all the rats are trained in a red light room to cross a square tapered<br>
beam of 1m length at an angle of approx 40 degrees running uphill towards its<br>
home cage. This task becomes progressively more difficult as the rat moves up<br>
the beam as the width of the beam decreases. The beam is marked so as to<br>
divide it into 3 sections for purposes of analysis, graded easy at the widest<br>
section (6 cm) through to hard at the tapered end (2 cm).<br>
Pre operative training - for 2 days each rat was taken from its home cage and<br>
placed onto the beam at increasing distances (approx 4 times in total). When<br>
each rat could cross the beam without coaxing and with few foot faults it is<br>
classed as trained. Any poor performers were excluded from the test.<br>
Testing - each rat was placed on the beam 3 times per test session and the<br>
latency to cross, number of foot slips, defined as a foot placement which does not<br>
achieve contact with the top surface of the beam, (hind and forelimb) was<br>
recorded manually and the average of these then taken. At weeks 5 for batch 1 •<br><br>
and week 4 for batch two of the animals, analysis was changed to video<br>
recording of the test. Analysis from the recorded test was then carried out in<br>
order to increase sensitivity.<br>
Test sessions for MCAO animals were prior to surgery, then post operative at<br>
day 7 and weekly thereafter until sacrifice at week 8.<br>
Dosing Regime<br>
Antibody was administered at 1 hour, 24 hours, 1 week and 2 weeks following<br>
occlusion.<br>
Groups:<br>
lgG1 control (5ug) (Group D)<br>
Antibody 2C4 (5ug) (Group F)<br>
Antibody 2C4 (15ug) (Group E)<br>
All preparations were made in sterile saline.<br>
Groups were blinded prior to administration.<br>
To avoid bias introduced by the order of rats used, a Latin square design was<br>
employed.<br>
Antibodies were dosed in a volume of 5ul stock (1 mg/ml and 3 mg/ml) delivered<br>
over 2min with the aid of an infusion pump (2.5 ul/min). Following injection,<br>
cannulae remained in place for a further 2 min.<br>
Neuropathology and Quantification of Ischaemic Damage<br>
8 weeks after MCA occlusion, rats were perfusion fixed with ice-cold 4%<br>
paraformaledehyde. The animals were then decapitated and the brains stored in<br>
' situ in ice-cold 4% paraformaledehyde, prior to dissection and processing for<br>
paraffin embedding and subsequent immunohistochemistry.<br>
For brain volume analysis brains were serially sliced from the anterior pole to the<br>
cerebellum for paraffin processing at 2mm intervals using a brain matrix. The<br>
brains are then paraffin processed and embedded in wax. 4 micron sections were<br>
collected that correspond to stereotactically pre-determined coronal planes from<br><br>
anterior +3mm to posterior -7.5mm relative to bregma. The sections were<br>
mounted on to poly lysine coated slides prior to staining with Haematoxylin and<br>
Eosin. The sections were analysed for lesion volume and swelling using a<br>
computer based image analysis system (Datacell, hardware. Optimas Software).<br>
Lesioned areas are comprised of tissue that has not been stained by the<br>
Haematoxylin and Eosin. Lesions are measured by tracing around the<br>
boundaries of the lesioned area and expressed as % lesioned area compared to<br>
contralateral non lesioned side of the brain.<br>
Statistical Analysis:<br>
The neuroscore and bodyweights data were analysed using a repeated<br>
measures ANOVA approach with time as the repeated measure. Lesion volume<br>
was analysed using a 1-way ANOVA and ANCOVA approach and lesion area<br>
was analysed using a repeated measures ANCOVA approach<br>
The foot slips data were analysed separately for the fore and hind limbs, to look<br>
for a group effect, using a repeated measures ANOVA approach with week and<br>
beam difficulty as the repeated measures. To look for differences between fore<br>
and hind limbs, the foot slips data were also analysed using a repeated<br>
measures ANOVA approach with week and leg as repeated measures, averaged<br>
across difficulty.<br>
Three animals from group E (high dose Ab group) received one dose less than<br>
the other animals in this group (see below). Although, the analysis was carried<br>
out with and without these animals and it showed there was no significant effect<br>
on the results and the animals were therefore included in the analysis, it is<br>
important to note that in the case of the cylinder test and the body weight profiles,<br>
when comparing animals dosed 3 times and animals dosed 4 times with controls,<br>
only animals dosed 4 times are significantly different to animals dosed with<br>
control antibody.<br><br>
It should be noted that during the course of this study, a number of rats died due '<br>
to a putative infection. As a consequence, three animals in the highest dose<br>
group (group E) received one dose less than the other animals in this group.<br>
Results:<br>
Three animals from group E (high dose Ab group) received one dose less than<br>
the other animals in this group. The data was analysed with and without these<br>
animals and there was no significant effect on the results of the analysis unless<br>
stated in the text.<br>
Figure 9 shows the lesion volume as a percentage of total brain volume in the<br>
control and 5ug and 15µg test groups. The antibody had no effect on lesion<br>
volume when compared to. the control group.<br>
Figure 10.<br>
This figure shows neuroscore data represented as means ± SEM. Due to the<br>
large range of data observed parametric analysis was deemed to be valid. There<br>
are significant differences between the 15 µg dosed group and control at weeks<br>
1,4,7 and 8.<br>
There are significant differences between the 15 µg dosed group and control at<br>
week 7 and 8 when analysed in this manner.<br>
Cylinder Test<br>
See figures 11 A, 11B, 11C, 11D. Cylinder data represented as mean ± SEM for<br>
A) both paws, B) left paw, C) right paw and D) right paw split into rats that<br>
received 3 doses of 15ug of anti-NOGO antibody, and those which received 4<br>
doses of anti-NOGO antibody.<br>
The 15 µg dose of the antibody produced a significant increase in the use of the<br>
right paw.<br>
When the high dose group is divided into rats receiving all four doses versus rats<br>
receiving only three doses of the antibody, no significant difference is seen<br>
between the two subgroups. However as shown in- figure 11D, when the 4 dose<br><br>
group is compared to the control group there exists a significant difference that is<br>
not seen when the 3 dose group is compared with control. Statistical analysis<br>
used Fisher's LSD test on repeated measures data.<br>
Tapered Beam<br>
See Figure 12.<br>
Figure 12 shows forelimb foot slips represented as mean ± 95% confidence<br>
intervals.<br>
*	In week 6, group F, the 5 µg dose is increasing the number of fore foot slips<br>
compared to group D, control, (p=0.0305).<br>
Although not shown here, number of forepaw foot slips increased with increasing<br>
difficulty along the beam.<br>
See figure 13.<br>
Figure 13 shows hindlimb footslips represented as mean ± 95 %confidence<br>
intervals.<br>
*	Group F, the 5 µg dose is significantly increasing the number of hind foot slips<br>
compared to group D, control, (p=0.0488) over the course of the study. In weeks<br>
6 and 7, group F is significantly increasing the number of hind foot slips<br>
compared to group D, (p=0.0098 and p=0.0370 respectively).<br>
Although not shown here, number of hindpaw foot slips increased with increasing<br>
difficulty along the beam.<br>
The data for latency for animals to cross the beam shows that in the initial week's<br>
latency decreases as the animals recover, however no effect of treatment is<br>
observed.<br>
Figure 14 A) shows body weights represented as means ± SEM. Dosing animals<br>
with 15 µg of the antibody causes an increase in body weight at 24 hours, 1 week<br>
and at every time point from week 3 to the completion of the study.<br>

Although not significantly higher than the other groups, the high dose group had<br>
a high proportion of animals removed through euthanasia or death. This could<br>

Conclusions:<br>
This study looked at the effect of two doses of the anti-NOGO antibody 2C4 on<br>
lesion volume and functional recovery after a 90 minute tMCAO when<br>
administered ICV at 1hour, 24 hours, 1 week and 2 weeks.<br>
•	The antibody treatment had no effect on lesion volume.<br>
•	The antibody treatment had a modest, but significant effect on<br>
neurological score at the highest dose of 15µg ICV. This dose significantly<br>
increased the neurological score at weeks 1,4,7 and 8 using the mean<br>
score (used as the data where spread over a large range, therefore<br>
justifying parametric analysis).<br>
•	The antibody treatment had a significant effect on right paw use in the<br>
cylinder test at the highest dose, 15µg ICV. This dose caused a significant<br>
increase in right paw use compared to control over the entire period of the<br>
study, there were also significant increases in right paw use specifically at<br>
weeks 2 and 6.<br>
•	The antibody treatment had no positive effect on performance on the<br>
tapered beam walking test. However, it appears that the low dose antibody<br>
group (5 µg ICV) increased the number of footslips, especially at week 6.<br>
However no difference was seen when the number of footslips per<br>
• difficulty section were analysed, nor when latency to cross the beam was<br>
analysed.<br><br>
• The antibody treatment had a significant effect on body weight at the<br>
highest dose, 15 µg ICV. This antibody group had a significantly increased<br>
body weight when compared to controls from 3 weeks onwards. Although<br>
not a functional outcome, body weight is a good reflection of general well<br>
being and this increase would reflect improved physiological recovery<br>
following tMCAO.<br>
The last 3 rats in the group receiving the higher dose of the antibody did not<br>
receive the fourth and final dose for the reasons given above. In order to<br>
determine the importance of this final dose a comparison of rats in the highest<br>
antibody dose group receiving 3 doses as opposed to 4 doses was carried out.<br>
Duration of Dosing<br>
Animals dosed 4 times significantly increased number of right paw placements<br>
whereas animals dosed 3 times did not. In addition, dosing in the second week<br>
appears to accelerate the increase in body weight when compared to animals<br>
dosed 3 times. Dosing 4 times also produces a significant increase in weight<br>
compared to controls whereas dosing 3 times does not.<br>
Dosing did not affect lesion volume, neurological score or performance in the<br>
tapered beam walking test<br>
Summary<br>
In summary, although the treatment had no effect on lesion volume, the highest<br>
dose of anti-NOGO antibody 2C4 (15µg) had a positive effect on functional<br>
recovery, as assessed by neuroscore set forth herein, following 3 or 4 doses and<br>
paw placement and body weight following administration of 4 doses.<br>
Example 11 - Effect of Intravenously administered anti-NOGO monoclonal<br>
antibodies on lesion volume and functional recovery following tMCAO.<br><br>
Aim:<br>
The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of the anti-NOGO<br>
monoclonal antibodies (mabs) 2A10 and 2C4 dosed intravenously (IV) on lesion<br>
volume and functional recovery of rats post transient left middle cerebral artery<br>
occlusion (tMCAO). Cylinder test, tapered beam and neurological score tasks<br>
were utilised to assess long term functional recovery following 90 minutes of<br>
transient ischaemia and brains were harvested for immunohistochemistry<br>
evaluation of regenerative processes and lesion, volume assessment.<br>
Methods:<br>
Induction of Focal Ischaemia<br>
All animals underwent tMCAO under halothane/oxygen/nitrous oxide anaesthesia<br>
as described by Longa and co-workers (Stroke, 1989,20, 84-91). Body<br>
temperature was monitored throughout the surgical procedure by a rectal<br>
thermometer, and the animals were maintained normothermic (37 + 0.50C) via a<br>
heating blanket controlled by the thermometer. Actual core temperature values<br>
were recorded at the time of MCA occlusion and at reperfusion.<br>
Ninety minutes after MCA occlusion, the rats were re-anaesthetised and the<br>
filament slowly and completely withdrawn to allow reperfusion. The arteriotomy<br>
is closed with diathermy, haemostasis was re-checked, and the cervical wound<br>
sutured closed.<br>
Post-Occlusion Recovery<br>
Following MCA occlusion, anaesthesia was discontinued and the animals<br>
allowed to regain consciousness under strict observation in an incubator (23-<br>
25oC) for 1 hour. The animals were then housed individually in the post-operative<br>
recovery room, where their overall health status was closely monitored<br>
throughout the survival period.<br>
Behavioural Tasks:<br><br>
Neurological Assessment:<br>
Motor and behavioural changes following MCA occlusion were assessed using a<br>
28 point grading scale ("neuroscore", see example 10 for details) at time points 1<br>
hour, 24 hours and then weekly for 8 weeks after MCA occlusion.<br>
Cylinder test:<br>
Animals were assessed Weekly in the cylinder test of forepaw placement.<br>
Animals were placed inside a transparent perspex cylinder 20cm in diameter and<br>
30 cm tall for a 3 minute period. The number of left, right and both forepaw<br>
placements whilst spontaneously rearing to explore the environment are<br>
assessed in this period. This test was conducted in red light conditions.<br>
Tapered beam walking:<br>
For this test all the rats are trained in a red light room to cross a square tapered<br>
beam of 1m length at an angle of approx 40 degrees running uphill towards its<br>
homecage. This task becomes progressively more difficult as the rat moves up<br>
the beam as the width of the beam decreases.<br>
Pre operative training - for 2 days each rat was taken from its homecage and<br>
placed onto the beam at increasing distances (approx 4 times in total). When<br>
each rat could cross the beam without coaxing and with few footfaults it is<br>
classed as trained. Any poor performers were excluded from the test.<br>
Testing - each rat was placed on the beam 3 times per test session and the<br>
latency to cross, number of footslips, defined as a foot placement which does not<br>
achieve proper contact with the top surface of the beam, (hind and forelimb) was<br>
recorded by video, assessed at a later date and the average of these then taken.<br>
Test sessions for MCAO animals were prior to surgery, then post op at day 7 and<br>
Weekly thereafter until sacrifice at week 8.<br>
Dosing Regime (IV)<br><br>
Antibody was administered intravenously at 1 hour, 24 hours, 1 week arid 2<br>
weeks following occlusion.<br>
Groups:<br>
A - 2C4 3mg/kg (4.7mg/kg adjusted due to low MW fractions)<br>
B-2A10 3mg/kg<br>
C - Control lgG2a 3mg/kg<br>
D-2A10 10mg/kg<br>
All preparations were made in sterile saline.<br>
Groups were blinded prior to administration.<br>
To avoid bias introduced by the order of rats used, a Latin square design was<br>
employed. Animals were randomised and operators were blinded to treatment.<br>
Neuropathology and Quantification of Ischaemic Damage<br>
8 weeks after MCA occlusion, rats were perfusion fixed with ice-cold 4%<br>
paraformaldehyde. The animals were then decapitated and the brains stored in<br>
situ in ice-cold 4% paraformaledehyde for 48 hrs, prior to dissection and<br>
processing for paraffin embedding and subsequent histological analysis.<br>
For brain volume analysis brains were serially sliced from the anterior pole to the<br>
cerebellum for paraffin processing at 2mm intervals using a brain matrix. The<br>
brains are then paraffin processed and embedded in wax. 4 micron sections were<br>
collected that correspond to sterotactically pre-determined coronal planes from<br>
anterior +3mm to posterior -7.5mm relative to bregma. The sections were<br>
mounted on to poly lysine coated slides prior to staining with Haematoxylin and<br>
Eosin. The sections were analysed for lesion volume using a computer based<br>
image analysis system (Datacell, hardware. Optimas Software). Lesioned areas<br>
are delineated by areas of tissue with reduced Haematoxylin and Eosin. Lesions<br>
are measured by tracing around the boundaries of the lesioned area and<br>
expressed as % lesioned area compared to contralateral non lesioned side of the<br>
brain.<br>
Statistical Analysis<br><br>
The neuroscore and bodyweights data were analysed using a repeated<br>
measures ANOVA approach with time as the repeated measure. Lesion volume<br>
was analysed using a 1-way ANOVA and ANCOVA approach and lesion area<br>
was analysed using a repeated measures ANCOVA approach<br>
The footslips data were analysed separately for the fore and hind limbs, to look<br>
for a group effect, using a repeated measures ANOVA approach with week and<br>
beam difficulty as the repeated measures. To look for differences between fore<br>
and hind limbs, the footslips data were also analysed using a repeated measures<br>
ANOVA approach with week and leg as repeated measures, averaged across<br>
difficulty.<br>
Results:<br>
Lesion Volume:<br>
Figure 15 represents the lesion volume as a percentage of total brain volume.<br>
The antibody had no effect on lesion volume when compared to the control<br>
group.<br>

Conclusions:<br>
This study looked at the effect of two doses of the anti-NOGO antibody 2A10 (3 &amp;<br>
10 mg/kg) and one dose of 2C4 (3 mg/kg) on lesion volume and functional<br>
recovery after a 90 minute tMCAO when administered IV at 1 hour, 24 hours, 1<br>
week and 2 weeks.<br>
•	The antibody treatment had no effect on lesion volume.<br>
•	The antibody treatment had a significant effect on neurological score at<br>
the highest dose of 2A10 (10 mg/kg) at 24 hours.<br>
•	The 2A10 antibody treatment (3mg/kg) had a significant effect on right<br>
paw use in the cylinder test specifically at weeks 1 and 2.<br>
•	2A10 (3mg/kg) had a clear effect of reducing the number of fore paw<br>
footslips at 1 and 2 weeks following tMCAO, 2A10 (10mg/kg) had the<br>
effect of reducing hind paw footslips at 2 weeks following tMCAO, and<br>
both concentrations of 2A10 reduced latency to cross the beam at 1 week<br>
following tMCAO. 2C4 (3 mg/kg) reduced forepaw footslips at 3 weeks<br>
following tMCAO relative to control antibody.<br><br>
Summary<br>
In summary, although the treatment had no effect on lesion volume, intravenous<br>
Injection of both the anti-NOGO monoclonal antibodies 2A10 and 2C4 had a<br>
positive effect on functional recovery, as assessed by neurological score, paw<br>
placement and tapered beam predominantly in the first two weeks following<br>
tMCAO.<br>
Example 12 - Transfection of NOGO cDNA into SHSY5Y-APP cells<br>
The day before transfection the SHSY5Y-APPwt cells were trypsinised, counted<br>
and replated at 200,000 to 1 million cells per well of a 6-weIl plate (Nunc).<br>
The NOGO expression construct (FLAG-tagged NOGO-A cDNA in pCDNA3<br>
(Invitrogen); MYC-tagged NOGO-B and NOGO-C in pCDNA3.1A) was<br>
complexed with PlusTM reagent by diluting the DNA into serum free medium<br>
(OptiMEM-1), adding PlusTM reagent, mixing and incubating at room<br>
temperature for 15 min. (6µl Plus reagent into a total volume of 100µl with 2µg<br>
DNA and OptiMEM-1 per well)<br>
LipofectAMINETM reagent was diluted into serum free medium (Optimem-I) in a<br>
second tube and mixed (4µl Lipofectamine in 100µl volume per well).<br>
Pre-complexed DNA (from above) was combined with the diluted lipofectAMINE,<br>
mixed and incubated at room temp for 15 min.<br>
Meanwhile the cells were washed with serum free medium (OptiMEM-l) and then<br>
fresh serum free medium was added to the cells (800µl per well).<br>
The DNA-Plus-LipofectAMINE reagent complexes were then added to the cells<br>
(200µl), mixed gently and the cells incubated at 37 °C for 5hr in 5% CO2.<br>
After 5 hours 1ml serum containing growth medium was added to the cells and<br>
the cells incubated overnight or 2 hours.<br>
After 14 hours (or 2 hours) all medium was removed and replaced with 1ml<br>
(OptiMEM-1) per well.<br><br>
After 48 hours conditioning the medium was collected and assayed for amyloid<br>
content as described in example 13.<br>
Example 13 - Detection of Aβ peptide by lGEN ELISA<br>
SHSY5Y cells overexpressing the human APPwt or Amyloid Precursor Protein<br>
Swedish variant sequence (APPswe) were seeded in 6 well or 96 well Nunc<br>
plates at the required density.<br>
After 24 hours the reagents (eg. antibody, peptides, compounds etc) for testing<br>
were added to the cells in a final volume of 120µl and cells incubated for 24hr.<br>
The medium was removed from cells and 50µl was assayed for Aβ x-40 and 50µl<br>
for Aβ x-42 in an overnight ORIGEN immunoassay employing Aβ C-terrninal<br>
specific antibodies. Briefly, Aβ peptides were captured using biotinylated 6E10<br>
(Signet Labs). Ori-tagged labelled Aβ C-terminal specific antibodies were used to<br>
detect the Aβ x-40 and Aβ x-42 species. Antibody- Aβ complexes were captured<br>
with streptavidin coated dynabeads and assayed in an IGEN M8 analyser.<br>
The viabiliy of the cells was checked using MTT (3-[4,5-DimethyIthiazoI-2-yr]-2,5-<br>
diphenyltetrazolium bromide; Thiazolyl blue) reagent. Briefly, MTT reagent<br>
(5mg/ml in phosphate buffered saline) was diluted 1:10 in culture medium and<br>
100ul added to each well. Following incubation at 37°C for4hr, 100µl solubilising<br>
solution (20% SDS/50% Dimethyl Formamide) was added. Absorbance of plates<br>
was read using a Delfia Wallac plate reader at 590nM.<br>
The results are shown in figures 21 to 34.<br>
SHSY5Y-APPwt cells express wild-type APP. SHSY5Y-APPswe cells express<br>
the Swedish mutation form of APP.<br><br>
Example 14 - The effect of NOGO-A expression on levels of secreted Aβ 40<br>
and Aβ 42 peptide<br>
When an expression construct expressing NOGO-A is introduced into either<br>
SHSY5Y-APPwt ceils or SHSY5Y-APPswe cells the levels of Aβ 40 and Aβ 42<br>
are seen to significantly increase suggesting that NOGO-A is in some way<br>
modulating, directly or indirectly, the proteolyic processing of APP and/or<br>
degradation of Aβ peptides. The fact that the product of this altered APP<br>
processing is the peptide Aβ40 could suggest that the effect of NOGO could be<br>
at the level of modulating β-secretase activity.<br>
Figure 21 shows the increase in the level of secreted Aβ40 when NOGO-A is<br>
expressed from an expression vector. The two left-hand bars are the controls<br>
(vector alone and vector carrying a control protein, green fluorescent protein<br>
(GFP)), showing the background levels of Aβ40 production in this cell-line. The<br>
remaining bars shows that significantly increased level of Aβ40 peptide are<br>
detected when NOGO-A, fused to a FLAG peptide, is expressed in the cells and<br>
also that a similar elevation, albeit less marked, when NOGO-B, fused to myc, is<br>
expressed.<br>
The same experiment was repeated using an ELISA specific for Ap42. The<br>
results showed a similar elevation in levels of Aβ 42 peptide secretion as that<br>
seen in the earlier experiment using Aβ 40 ELISA. Again NOGO-B also showed<br>
increased secretion of Aβ 42 peptide and again the increase was less marked<br>
than with NOGO-A. The results are shown in figure 22.<br>
Repeat experiments comparing levels of secreted peptide from cells transfected<br>
with NOGO-A compared to vector pCDNA3 alone, are shown in figures 23 (for <br>
Aβ 40) and 24 (for Aβ 42).<br>
A direct comparison of levels of Aβ 40 and Aβ 42 peptide secreted is shown in<br>
figure 25. Figure 25 is the average of three to five separate experiments to<br>
confirm the consistency of NOGO.<br><br>
Thus the invention provides the use of an anti-NOGO antibody (particularly an<br>
anti-NOGO-A and/or anti-NOGO-B antibody) in the manufacture of a medicament<br>
for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.<br>
Example 15 - anti-NOGO-A antibody inhibits Aβ 40 and Aβ 42 peptide<br>
secretion from SHSY5Y-APPwt and SHSY5Yswe cells<br>
Figure 26 shows the dramatic reduction in levels of Aβ 40 and Aβ 42 peptide<br>
secreted from SHSY5Y-APPwt cells expressing endogenous NOGO-A when the<br>
anti-NOGO antibody 2A10 is introduced into the culture medium.<br>
The effect is seen in a dose-dependent manner, at 30µg/ml reaching inhibition<br>
levels of almost 90%. There is no apparent difference in the effect between Aβ <br>
40 and Aβ 42 peptides (white bars and black bars respectively in figure 26), in<br>
other words any effect of the anti-NOGO antibody on APP processing is not<br>
preferential for either the Aβ 40 or Aβ 42 peptides.<br>
Figure 27 shows the same experiment as in figure 26 but with an unrelated lgG1<br>
. antibody. As can clearly be seen in the figure, an unrelated (non anti-NOGO A)<br>
monoclonal antibody has no inhibitory effect on the levels of Aβ 40 and Aβ 42<br>
peptide secretion from the cells.<br>
Figure 28 shows that the same unrelated lgG1 antibody similarly shows little or<br>
no inhibitory effect on the levels of Aβ 40 and Aβ 42 peptide secretion from<br>
SHSY5Y-APPswe cells expressing NOGO-A.<br>
Similarly figure 29 shows the results of the same experiment as described above<br>
for figure 26 but using an anti-NOGO monoclonal antibody which binds to<br>
NOGO-A but is not a function-blocker (6D5). The non-function-blocking anti-<br>
NOGO-A monoclonal antibody has minimal effect (less than 10%) on the<br>
secretion of Aβ 40 and Aβ 42 peptides from SHSY5Y-APPwt cells expressing<br>
NOGO-A. This result suggests that the results shown in figure 26 are a result of<br>
the inhibition of NOGO functional activity by the anti-NOGO antibody.<br>
Figure 30 shows the results of the same experiment as for figure 29, using the<br>
non-function blocking anti-NOGO monoclonal antibody (6D5) but with SHSY5Y-<br>
APPswe cells expressing endogenous NOGO-A. As before (figure 29) there is<br><br>
minimal effect on the levels of Aβ 40 and Aβ 42 being secreted by this cell line,<br>
being less than 10% inhibition.<br>
Figure 31 shows the results of an experiment which extends the results of the<br>
experiment of figure 26. Figure 31 shows that the concentration-dependent<br>
effect of the inhibitory effect shown by the function-blocking antibody 2A10/3<br>
continues at a higher concentration, a level of greater than 90% inhibition being<br>
achieved at an antibody concentration of 50ng/ml.<br>
Figure 32 shows the results of an identical experiment to that of figure 31 except<br>
that SHSY5Yswe cells are used. The concentration-dependent inhibitory effect<br>
of the antibody 2A10/3 continues to be seen at the higher concentration of<br>
50µg/ml.<br>
Figure 33 shows the effect of a different function-blocking anti-NOGO-A antibody,<br>
2C4, on the secretion of Aβ 40 and Aβ 42 peptides from SHSY5Y-APPwt cells.<br>
The results show a concentration-dependent inhibitory effect on the levels of Aβ <br>
40 and Aβ 42 peptide secretion to a level of 36% at a concentration of 20µg/ml.<br>
Again the effect is seen on both Aβ 40 and Aβ 42 peptides.<br>
Figure 34 compares the inhibitory effect of the anti-NOGO-A function-blocking<br>
antibodies 2A10, 2C4 and 15C3 (at the concentrations shown in the figure) with<br>
other control antibodies 10A4, lgG2b arid 14D12. The figure shows that the<br>
effect on inhibition of Aβ 40 and Aβ 42 secretion is specific to the function-<br>
blocking anti-NOGO-A monoclonal antibodies.<br>
Example 16 - Increased NogoA expression elevates Aβ levels in a dose-<br>
dependent manner<br>
To investigate the effect of NogoA expression on Aβ levels, SHSY5Y-APPwt cells<br>
were transiently transfected with increasing amounts of C-terminal myc tagged<br>
NogoA cDNA. The total amount of cDNA (5ug) was kept constant for each<br>
transfection using pcDNA3.1myc cDNA. 48hr post-transfection, culture medium<br>
was removed and assayed for Aβ40. In addition, cells were harvested and lysed<br>
in 10mM Tris/HCI containing 1% Triton X-100 and Complete protease inhibitors<br>
(Roche). Cell lysates were resolved on 10% Novex Tris-glycine gels and subject<br><br>
 to Western blot analysis with an anti-NogoA antibody. An increase in NogoA<br>
protein expression was observed with increasing NogoA cDNA concentrations.<br>
This was concomitant with a corresponding increase in Aβ40 levels in the<br>
medium from these cells. Thus, increased expression of NogoA causes a dose-<br>
dependent increase in Aβ40 levels. See Figure 36.<br>
Example 17 - Chimeric 2A10 (HcLc)<br>
A chimaeric antibody consisting of parent murine V regions grafted onto human<br>
lgG1/k wild type C regions was designed to be used as a reference when testing<br>
humanised constructs. The NOGO 2A10 VH domain in the mouse recombinant<br>
Rld plasmid was cut Hind Ill-Spe I and ligated into the Rln vector containing<br>
hCy1wt. The NOGO 2A10 V| domain in the mouse recombinant Rln plasmid was<br>
cut Hind lll-BsiW I and ligated into the Rln vector containing hCk.<br><br>

Example 18 - Humanised anti-NOGO antibodies bind to human NOGO<br>
GST-human NOGO-A56 at 1 ug/ml in 50mM Tris pH9.5 was coated onto Nunc<br>
Immunosorp plates (100ul per well) at 4 °C overnight. Wells were rinsed once<br>
with TBS + 0.05% tween then incubated with 2% BSA in TBS + 0.05% tween to<br>
block non-specific binding sites at room temperature for 1hour. Antibodies were<br>
diluted in TBS + 0.05% tween + 2% BSA to 10µg/ml and 1/2 dilutions made from<br>
this. Antibodies were added to wells in duplicate and incubated at at room<br>
temperature for 1hour. Wells were washed three times with TBS + 0.05% tween<br>
then incubated with anti-human kappa peroxidase conjugate (1:2000) for 1hour.<br>
Washed three times with TBS + 0.05% tween and then incubated with 100pl<br>
OPD peroxidase substrate (Sigma) per well for 10 minutes. The colour reaction<br>
was stopped by the addition of 25ul concentrated H2SO4. Optical density at<br>
490nm was measured using a plate reader. Background values read from wells<br>
with no antibody were subtracted.<br>
Figures 35A to C illustrates the dose-dependent binding of humanised antibody<br>
H1L11 in comparison with the chimera (HcLc) to human NOGO-A56 in an ELISA<br>
assay. The Y-axis shows the measured optical density (OD) at 490nm, a<br>
quantitative measure of antibody captured in the wells. The X-axis shows the<br>
concentration of antibody used (ug/ml) per well at each data point. Antibodies<br>
H1L11 and HcLc give EC50 values of of 0.118 µg/ml and 0.022 µg/ml<br>
respectively.<br><br>
