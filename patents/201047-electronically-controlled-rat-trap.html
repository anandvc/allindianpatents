				<th>Abstract</th>
				<td>The invention relates to electronically continuously operable Rat Trap Device Comprising of a Hood, Trap-plate &amp; Receptacle. The bait is kept in Hood. Trap-plate is electronically operable &amp; traps the rat and receptacle&quot; captures the trapped rodent. The said trap-plate further comprises of freely hinged operable spring loaded trap door at the rear portion, a set of metal strips in front portion and the electronic circuit at the bottom working on batteries. The rodent enticed by bait, moves towards the hood, as the foreleg touches the front edge of trap-door, switch underneath is activated and triggers the circuit. The hind leg of the rodent which is on the metal strip receives a shock, due to which the rodent jumps and jumps forward by reflex. The jump thereby activates the hinge mechanism, the trap door opens from horizontal position at an angle less than 87&quot; and drops the rodent down onto the receptacle. The trap door reverts to horizontal position again to continue the process of trapping.</td>

				<td>This invention in general relates to Rodent trapping, which is applicable to domestic or commercial environment.<br>
It is our object of the invention to construct a novel device which executes the Rodent Trapping using the principle of non-lethal electri¬cal shock at 200 Volts amplified from 3 Volts supplied by 2 alkaline cells.<br>
The existent model of spring loaded Traps are very cumbersome. Also they are only mechanical. Manual intervention is required after every trap. This invention has1 overcome the aforesaid problems.<br>
It is another object of the invention to make the above process in a most mechanised and automatic manner.<br>
It is another object of the invention to make the system noiseless and avoid using powerful spring loaded mechanics trapping devices.<br>
It is another object of the invention to make the system cost effective and safe.<br>
It is another objective of the invention to make the system mobile hence may be moved from one place to another.<br>
It is another objective of the invention to enable the system to suit the Trapping of Rodent dead or alive.<br><br>
It is another objective of the invention to make the process con¬tinuous with out manual intervention.<br>
It is another object of the invention to make the system clean and efficient.<br>
These and other objects of the invention will be apparent from the ensuring detailed description.<br>
The Trap device consists essentially of three part i-<br>
1.	Trap Plate.<br>
2.	The Top Cover - Hood.<br>
3.	The Receptacle.<br>
The Trap plate is the most essential part of the system. It is spring loaded and electrically wired. The outer dimensions of the plate are Length 24" and Breadth 18".<br>
a.	On the plate a rectangular portion measuring Length 13.5" and<br>
Breadth 16.5" is cut away. This cutting is done 10" away from the front.<br>
b.	In this cut down area the spring loaded Trap door is accommodated.<br>
The dimensions of the Trapdoor are Length 13" and Breadth 16", allowing<br>
herewith free hinged movement of the spring loaded Trap door within the<br>
cut portion, when pressure is applied by the Rodent.<br><br>
c.	To allow the free movement of the Trap door, the hinge mechanism is<br>
screwed on at the lower sides of the Trap plate, 3" from the front of<br>
the plate. When the device is not activated the Trap door will assume<br>
horizontal position. When activated it opens downwards and after the<br>
Rodent drops, the door reverts back to horizontal position automatical¬<br>
ly. The forward rotation of the rat trap door is limited to 87 Degrees<br>
so that the door will come to initial stage to continue the process<br>
without any break. This will also prevent the door from rotating in the<br>
opposite direction and getting settled there.<br>
d.	Metal strips which are 16" long and 0.1" wide	are fitted on the<br>
bottom plate. The separation between the strips are	0.1". These strips<br>
start from the front edge of the plate and extend	upto 9" from the<br>
front.<br>
e.	The underside of the plate will also house two springs and a<br>
switch. These are fixed on the front edge of the Trap door.<br>
In the normal un-activated condition, the Trap door will remain horizontal. The strips will have alternate polarity. These will receive high frequency voltage of 200 Volts, which is stepped up from our origi¬nal 3 Volts supply. The stepping is achieved using an electronic cir¬cuit.<br>
2.    RECEPTACLE<br>
The Receptacle is the unit which receives the Trapped Rodent fall¬ing down from the Trap plate. The dimensions are Height 18", breadth 18"<br><br>
and Length 24". The receptacle consists of inner walls of glass for preventions of climbing up by the Rodent. It may be filled with water also for drowning the captured rodent.<br>
3. WOOD<br>
The top cover of the hood has its front open. Its dimensions are Height 12", Breadth 18" and Length 24". This is fixed as the cover to the Trap plate which is at the bottom. A suitably placed bait inside the hood is expected to entice the Rodents to the Trap.<br>
The apparatus is a novel device, using the principle of non-lethal<br>
e<br>
electrical shock at 200 Volts to propel the Rodent forward. The pressure generated by the jumping of the Rodent in turn triggers the opening of a spring loaded Trap door forcing the Rodent to drop down into a water filled chamber. The Trap door reverts to its original horizontal state, the instant Rodent drops down, allowing the process of Trapping to continue without any need for attention or resetting.<br>
The voltage is supplied from two alkaline cells (2 x 1.5 V) con¬nected in series, totally eliminating any risk of electrocution. The 3 Volts supplied by the cells will be amplified to 200 Volts using an electronic circuit.<br>
Now the invention, will be described in detail with reference to the sequence of operation.<br><br>
The device when placed at a location, is in un-activated condition. The Trap door is in horizontal position.<br>
A bait is placed inside the hood to entice the Rodent. The Rodent enticed by the bait, moves towards the bait.<br>
The Rodent moves forward and its forelegs is placed on the front edge of the Trap door, the underside of this position of Trap door houses two springs and a switch. The instant the foreleg is placed, the switch is switched on and this in turn triggers the amplifying circuit. The 3 Volts supplied-by the- cells will be amplified to 200 Volts.<br>
The body of .the Rodent is along the metal strips. At the instant when the foreleg is activating the amplifying circuit, the hind leg is in contact with metal strips. In the circumstances, high frequency voltage is discharged to the hind legs of the Rodent via the metal strips. Due to the electrical shock though non-lethal by reflex action, the Rodent attempts to jump forward to escape.This jump results in tripping the hinge mechanism and hence the opening of the Trap door. The Rodent now slips down to the receptacle and is trapped. The hinged Trap door reverts back to its original horizontal state after the Rodent is dropped off into the receptacle.<br>
The process can repeat itself any number of times. The Rodent, which is trapped in the receptacle is alive as it drops in. By storing water in the lower chamber the trapped Rodent can be drowned and killed jf<br><br>
need be. The whole unit, using this principle, and by varying the dimen¬sion of the constituent parts, can be used for Trapping Rodents of any size from mice to huge bandi coots. To trap big size rodents which are outside houses, large receptacle should be placed in suitable pit made in the ground, so that the trap plate will be in level with ground for easy trapping.<br>
In the system, the bait used to attract the rodent remains un¬changed without being bitten or eaten by rodent. So the fixing of bait after every trapping is totally eliminated. This is also a very special and novel feature in this system.<br><br><br><br>
