				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates generally to computed tomograph (CT) imaging and, more particularly, to detectors utilized in connection with CT systems.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In at least some computed tomograph (CT) imaging system configurations, an x-ray source projects a fan-shaped beam which is collimated to lie within an X-Y plane of a Cartesian coordinate system and generally referred to as the "imaging plane". The x-ray beam passes through the object being imaged, such as a patient. The beam, after being attenuated by the object, impinges upon an array of radiation detectors. The intensity of the attenuated beam radiation received at the detector array is dependent upon the attenuation of the x-ray beam by the object. Each detector element of the array produces a separate electrical signal that is a measurement of the beam attenuation at the detector location. The attenuation measurements from all the detectors are acquired separately to produce a transmission profile.<br>
In known third generation CT systems, the x-ray source and the detector array are rotated with a gantry within the imaging plane and around the object to be imaged so that the angle at which the x-ray beam intersects the object constantly changes. X-ray sources typically include x-ray tubes, which emit the x-ray beam at a focal spot. X-ray detectors typically include a collimator for collimating x-ray beams received at the detector, a scintillator adjacent the collimator, and photodiodes adjacent the scintillator<br>
Multislice CT systems are used to obtain data for an increased number of slices during a scan. Known multislice systems typically<br>
include detectors generally known[ a^Me^lmjensional (3-D) detectors. With such 3-D detectors, a plurality of detector cells form separate channels arranged in columns and rows.<br>
A scintillator for a 3-D detector may have scintillator elements with dimensions of about 1 x 2x3 rorn, with narrow gaps of only a few mils, for example, about 0.004 inches, between adjacent elements. As a result of the small size and the close proximity of the elements, fabrication of such elements is difficult. Further, and in use, a signal impinged upon one scintillator element may be improperly reflected upward or to adjacent elements creating crosstalk and loss of resolution. Also, with such small scintillator elements, the magnitude of the generated optical signal may be small, and any losses that occur can significantly deteriorate signal quality.<br>
It would be desirable to provide a scintillator element that increases the magnitude of the optical signal provided to the photodiode by minimizing the amount of light lost by the element. It would also be desirable to provide a scintillator element having increased spatial resolution. It would further be desirable to provide a scintillator element which includes a light absorber to minimize the amount of light transferred between adjacent elements.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
These and other objects may be attained by a scintillator including a plurality of scintillator elements laid out as an aray having gaps between the adjacent elements. The gaps_are filled with a composition containing a reflective material, a light absorber, and a castable polymer. In one embodiment, the gap are filled with a composition of a white, highly diffuse reflective material including titanium dioxide .and a castable epoxy. The composition minimizes the amount light that is reflected out of the elements and increases the strength of a signal transmitted to a photodiode located adjacent the scintillator element.<br>
In one embodiment, the scintillator is fabricated by temporally bonding together a stack of scintillator wafers and then cutting the wafers into first bar stacks. After separating the first bar stacks into individual bars, the bars are placed in a fixture with gaps between the bars. The gaps are then filled with the reflective material to form a 2 dimensional array. After the reflective material has cured, a plurality of arrays are stacked and cut into a plurality of second bar stacks. The second bar stacks are then separated into individual second bars and placed in a fixture with gaps between the second bars. The gaps are filled with the reflective material composition to form a 3-D scintillator array having, in one embodiment, 256 scintillator elements.<br>
The above described scintillator provide a higher magnitude signal to the photodiode by minimizing the amount of light that is lost from the scintillator elements. Additionally, the described scintillator includes a light absorber to minimize the amount of light transferred between adjacent scintillator elements.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Figure 1  is a perspective view of a scintillator 20 including a<br>
plurality of scintillator elements 24 which are laid out in an array having<br>
first gaps 28 and second gaps 32. Scintillator elements 24 are fabricated<br>
from, for example, polycrystalline ceramic scintillator material or single<br>
crystal scintillation material.   To increase the spatial resolution and the<br>
strength of a signal supplied to a photodiode located adjacent one of<br>
scintillator elements 24, gaps 28 and 32 are filled with a reflective<br>
material 36. The width of gaps 28 and 32 may range from about 0.5 to 6<br>
mils. Reflective material 36 is cast on the adjacent surfaces of elements<br>
24 so that less of the light signal generated by elements 24 is improperly<br>
reflected.    In one embodiment, reflective material 36 is selected from<br>
silver, aluminum, or gold to provide a reflector having a high reflection<br>
and a low absorption of light.   In an alternative embodiment, reflective<br>
material 36 is a white highly diffuse reflective material including, for<br>
example,  a composition of titanium dioxide (Ti02) and a castable<br>
polymer. The composition of reflective material 36 includes about 20% to<br>
70% by weight Ti02 and a castable epoxy.   In another embodiment, a<br>
light absorber, for example, chromium oxide (Cr203) can be added to the<br>
composition to reduce crosstalk between scintillator elements 24.<br>
In fabricating photosensitive scintillator 20, and referring to Figures 2 and 3, thin scintillator wafers 100 are ground or lapped to a preselected thickness T, for example, 3 mm. Wafers 100 are then temporally bonded together using a low melting point adhesive or other temporary adhesive to form a stack 104. Stack 104 is cut into first bar stacks 108 using an inner diameter (ID) saw or wire saw (not shown). In one embodiment, first bar stacks 108 are cut using an inner diameter saw (not shown). The saw<br>
has a blade having an inner circumference cutting edge and is used to accurately cut first bar stacks 108 approximately 1 mm wide. After cutting first bar stacks 108, the temporary adhesive bond is broken and first bar stacks 108 are separated into individual bars 112.<br>
Referring to Figure 4 and 5, individual bars 112 are placed into a<br>
fixture (not shown) and bonded in an array 114 so that bars 112 are<br>
spaced apart from each other forming gaps 28.   In one embodiment,<br>
sixteen bars are placed in the fixture having gaps 28 of about 4 mils in<br>
width.    After filling gaps 28 with reflective material 36 and allowing<br>
material 36 to cure on adjacent surfaces of bars 112, array 114 is<br>
removed from the fixture.   A plurality of bonded arrays 114 are then<br>
stacked together to form a second stack 116, for example, of ten arrays<br>
114.  Second stack 116 is then cut in a manner similar to first bar stacks<br>
108 but perpendicular to the length of bars 112 to create second bar<br>
stacks 120.  In one embodiment, second bar stacks 120 are 2 mm wide.<br>
After separating second bar stacks 120 into individual second bars 122,<br>
second bars 122 are placed in a fixture (not shown) so that second bars<br>
122 are spaced apart from each other forming gaps 32.     In one<br>
embodiment as shown in Figure 6, sixteen second bars are placed in the<br>
fixture with gaps 32 equal in width to gaps 28. After bonding in an array,<br>
gaps 32 are filled with cast reflective material 36 in a manner similar to<br>
gaps 28. After material 36 has cured and reflective material 36 is cast to<br>
the outer periphery, finished scintillator 20 having elements 24 is removed<br>
from the fixture.<br>
In one embodiment, wafers 100 are 50 mm square and at least 3 mm thick with finished elements 24 having dimensions of 3 mm high, 2 mm long and 1 mm wide. Of course, various embodiments are possible, including wafers 100 being 1 mm thick so that bars 112 are 3 mm wide and the second cut creates 2 mm long second bars 122. The resulting elements 24 would be the same size as described above.<br>
In an alternative embodiment shown in Figure 7, scintillator 150 includes scintillator elements having eight adjacent elements are identified as interior elements 154 and all other scintillator elements are identified as edge elements 158. Scintillator 150 is fabricated identically to scintillator 20 except a second reflective material 200 is cast adjacent outer periphery of edge elements 158. The composition of second reflective material 200 includes less light absorber, for example, chromium oxide, than reflective material 36. Reflective material 200 allows edge elements 158 to create a higher strength signal than elements 154 as a result of the reduced light absorber content. The higher strength signal increases uniformity by compensating for the light lost at the edges of scintillator 150.<br>
The above described apparatus and method produces a scintillator that increases the signal to the photodiode at the outer periphery by increasing the amount of light that is reflected to the photodiode. Additionally, the described scintillator includes a light absorber to minimize the amount of light transferred between adjacent scintillator elements. In addition, the described scintillator compensates for gain variations of the outer elements and improves the light output uniformity of the scintillator.<br>
From the preceding description of various embodiments of the present invention, it is evident that the objects of the invention are attained. Although the invention has been described and illustrated in detail, it is to be clearly understood that the same is intended by way of illustration and example only and is not to be taken by way of limitation.
