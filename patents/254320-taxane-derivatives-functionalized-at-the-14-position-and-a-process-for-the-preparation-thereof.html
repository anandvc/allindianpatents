				<td>TAXANE DERIVATIVES FUNCTIONALIZED AT THE 14- POSITION AND A PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION THEREOF<br>
DISCLOSURE<br>
The present invention relates to novel 13-ketobaccatin III and taxane derivatives and to the processes for the preparation thereof. TECHNOLOGICAL BACKGROUND<br>
WO 94/22856 discloses 14-hydroxy-taxanes having improved antitumor properties compared with conventional taxanes. One of said 14-hydroxy derivatives, referred to as IDN 5109, is at present under advanced clinical development. Said 14-hydroxylated derivatives can be easily prepared from natural 14-hydroxybaccatin.<br>
It has now been found that IDN 5109 analogues bearing different sobstituents than the hydroxy group at the 14- position have surprising biological activity, as they are effective not only against taxane-resistant tumors but also against MDR cell lines.<br>
The derivatives of the invention can be obtained by enolization of 13-ketobaccatin III and treatment with suitable electrophiles which can be converted into the desired group. Subsequent reduction of the C13 carbonyl and esterification with isoserine chains afford the compounds of the invention, as defined below..<br>
7-Protected 13-ketobaccatin III is a very interesting compound as a key intermediate to 12,13-isotaxanes (Wicnienski et al, US 5,821,363), to novel taxanes modified at the 13- position (Menichincheri et al., WO9614308) and at the C and D ring (Dubois et al., Tetrahedr. Lett. 2000, 41, 3331-3334; Uoto et al., Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1997, 45(12), 2093-2095). 7-Protected 13-ketobaccatin III is an important intermediate in the studies on total synthesis of taxol and analogues (Nicolaou et al., J. Arn. Chem. Soc. 1995, 117, 624-633; Nicolaou et al. 1995, 117,<br><br>
2409-2420; Nicolaou et al., US 5,504,222). Some modifications of 7-protected 13-ketobaccatin in have also been reported, such as formation of hydrazones and oximes (Menichincheri et al., W09614308; Meru'nchincheri et al., Med. Chem. Res. (1996), 6(4), 264-292), direct treatment with oxidizing agents (Bombardelli et al., WO0212215; Harriman et al, Tetrahedr. Lett. 1995,36(49), 8909-8912; or with reducing agents (Marder et al, Tetrahedr. 1995, 51(7), 1985-1994). Reactions of 13,14-enolization have not been described insofar, while rearrangement reactions in bases have been disclosed (Pinciroli et al., Tetrahedr. Lett. 1996, 37(52), 9365-9368; Yu and Liu, Tetrahedr. Lett. 1997, 38(23), 4133-4136).<br>
According to a further aspect, the invention relates to a process for the 13,14 enolization of 13-ketobaccatin III to give intermediates sufficiently stable for further elaboration.<br>

According to the present invention, compounds of formula II wherein E is -OH, =N2, -N3, -NH-N=N-Ts? -NH-N=N-5oc, -N(CO2R7)NHCO2R7, =CH-R8, can be obtained from suitable 13-ketobaccatin III protected derivatives of formula I through a process which is shown in the following scheme and involves:<br>
a)	treatment with bases to form an enolate of formula IV, wherein M is an<br>
alkali metal;<br>
b)	treatment of enolate IV with a suitable electrophile which can be<br>
converted to an E group to give a compound of formula II.<br>
Scheme<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Formation of enolate in step a) can be easily obtained by treatment of protected 13-ketobaccatin III with a base such as potassium t-butoxide, potassium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide, lithium diisopropyl amine in inert solvents such as tetrahydrofuran or diethyl ether, also in admixture with hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA) or l,3-dimethyl-3,4,5,6-tetrahydro-2[lH]-pyrimidinone (DMPU). The reaction is suitably carried out in a range of temperatures from -40 to -78°C.<br>
Particularly preferred protective groups are silyl ethers, acetals, ethers, carbonates and carbamates.<br>
Starting 13-ketobaccatin III (formula I) is easily obtainable from the appropriate protected baccatin by reaction with conventional oxidizers, as described in literature.<br>
7-Protected 13-ketobaccatin III having different benzoate groups at the 2- position can be prepared according to the method by Ojima et al. (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000, 122, 5343-5353).<br>
In the reported examples, R1 is usually terr-butoxycarbonyl (Boc), triethylsilyl (TES) or 2-methoxypropane (MOP), and R2 is usually acetyl, but other equivalent groups can be conveniently used to prepare similar compounds.<br>
According to the scheme above, in step b) enolate IV is treated in situ<br>
with electrophiles such as oxaziridines (e.g. N-benzenesulfonyl phenyl oxaziridine, N-benzenesulfonyl m-nitrophenyl oxaziridine and camphorsulfonyloxaziridme), diazadicarboxylates (e.g. di-terf-butyl diazadicarboxylate and dibenzyl diazadicarboxylate), p-toluenesulfonylazide, t-butoxycarbonylazide, aldehydes (e.g. acetaldehyde, ethylglyoxylate) to give 13-ketobaccatine III of formula II wherein E is -OH, -NH-N=N-Ts, -NH-N=N-Boc, -N(CO2R7)NHCO2R7, =CH-R8.<br>
When p-toluenesulfonylazide is used as the electrophile, the product wherein E is NH-N=N-Ts (or the N=N-NHTs tautomer) is obtained, besides decomposition products wherein E is N3 or N2. The quenching conditions of the reaction may be modulated to direct the reaction mainly to only one of the products. Thus, the tosylazido derivative can be recovered from the crude product by extraction with polar aprotic solvents such as dichloromethane or ethyl acetate. The diazo derivative is obtained upon stirring the reaction crude in polar aprotic solvents for reasonably long times, optionally under heating. The azido derivative is obtained by treating the reaction crude with protic agents, such as mixtures of acetic acid in THF with DMPU or HMPA, immediately after addition of the azide donor.<br>
When ethyl glyoxylate is used as the electrophile, crotonic condensation with concomitant closure of the carbethoxy group at the Cl hydroxyl group takes place, to give an a,C-unsaturated y-lactone.<br>
In all cases, diastereoselection of the reaction is such that the E group is introduced mainly in 146 configuration.<br>
Alternatively, enolate IV can be treated with silylating (e.g. tri-i-propyl silyl chloride), acylating (e.g. di-terf-butylpyrocarbonate), alkylating (e.g. dimethyl sulfate or methyl iodide) or phosphorylating agents thereby obtaining enol derivatives of formula V<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein<br>
R10    is acyl, alkyl, trialkylsilyl or phosphate, and<br>
R1, R2 and R$ are as defined above.<br>
Compounds V can also be easily obtained by enolization of ketone of formula n with particularly weak bases such as triethylamme or pyridine in aprotic solvents such as methylene chloride, toluene or mixtures thereof.<br>
Compounds V can afford compounds of formula II by treatment with electrophiles in suitable conditions.<br>
The groups introduced at the 14- position with the procedure described above can be further transformed to obtain other 13-ketobaccatin III derivatives functionalized at the 14- position.<br>
Thus, compounds of formula II wherein E is -N(CO2R7)NHCO2R7 can be converted in the corresponding hydrazino derivatives (wherein E is -NH-NH2) by decarboxylation according to conventional methods.<br>
Compounds of formula II wherein E is -N3 are easily reduced to amine (E = NH2) by means of reductive systems such as triphenylphosphine in aqueous medium or H2-Pd/C in a suitable solvent.<br>
Compounds of formula II wherein E is -OH or -NH2 can be treated with carbonating (e.g. carbonyldiimidazole, phosgene or triphosgene), thiocarbonating (e.g. thiocarbonyl diimidazole, thiophosgene) or sulforylating agents (e.g. sulforyl chloride or thionyl chloride), to obtain compounds of formula II wherein E is -OR3 or -NHR3. The reaction can be conveniently<br>
carried out in chlorinated solvents in the presence of a base (e.g. pyridine or triethylamine) in a range of temperatures from -40°C to 70°C.<br>
Alternatively, compounds of formula II wherein E is -OH or -NH2 can be alkylated with such agents as alkyl halides or benzyl halides in the presence of weak bases.<br>
Compounds of formula II are key intermediates for the synthesis of compounds of formula III of the invention. In particular, compounds III are obtainable from compounds of formula II wherein E is -O-R3, -N3, -NH-R3, =CH-Rg, and R1} R4, Re are as defined above;<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
through a process which comprises:<br>
a)	reduction of the CIS carbonyl to give compounds of formula VII<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein<br>
X is -O-R3, -N3, -NH-R3, -CH2-R8;<br>
Y and Z are hydrogen or, when X is -CH2-R8, are taken together to form<br>
a double bond;<br>
and the other groups are defined as above;<br>
b)	esterification at the 13- position with derivatives of acids of formula<br>
IX	to give compounds of formula VIII<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein<br>
R4, R5, R6, R9 are as defined above;<br>
X	is -O-R3, -N3, -NH-R3; =CH-R8;<br>
c)        optional cleavage of the protective groups.<br>
Reduction of C13 ketone of step a) is carried out with suitable hycrides such as sodium borohydride. lithium borohydride, tetrabutylammonium borohydride, tetraethylammonium borohydride, sodium triacetoxy borohydride. The reaction can be carried out in a stoichiometric amount of reducing agent, although an excess is usually preferred. Depending on the used reducing agent, the reaction is carried out in alcohols, ethers, mixtures of alcohols and ethers or inert solvents, at temperatures ranging from -50 to 0=C.<br>
CIS Esterification of step b) is usually carried out by action of carboxylic acids, or the corresponding salts, of formula IX<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
wherein<br>
R11 and R13, which can be the same or different, are C1-C6 alkyl, aryl. or<br>
heteroaryl;<br>
R12 is C1-C6 alkyl, aryl, heteroaryl or C1-C4 alkoxy;<br>
in the presence of condensing agents such as carbodiimides (e.g. dicyclohexylcarbodilmide or ethyl dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide). Other known methods for the esterification at the 13- position of 7-protected baccatin III can also be successfully used.<br>
Protective groups in step c) are removed under the conditions described in literature for the concerned protective group.<br>
The most preferred carboxylic acid is the N-Boc-isobutylisoserine derivative of formula X<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
In this  case,  coupling with  compounds   of formula VII  under the conditions illustrated in the examples yields compounds of formula XI<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
which by selective deprotection at the 7- position afford compounds of formula XII<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
which are subjected to opening of the oxazolidine ring, to yield compounds of formula XIII<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein<br>
X, R3, R4, and R6 are as defined above.<br>
In case C13 esterification is carried out with the carboxylic acid of formula X, C7 deprotection is preferably effected before opening the oxazolidine.<br>
Derivative of formula XI wherein X is -N3 is particularly interesting, in that it is an useful intermediate for the preparation of compounds of formula XIV<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein<br>
R3      is hydrogen, acyl, alkyl or, taken together with R4, forms a C=O,<br>
C=S, SO, SO2 group; R4      is hydrogen or, taken together with R3, forms a C=O, OS, SO,<br>
SO2 group;<br>
according to an alternative preparation process to that described above, comprising:<br>
a)	reduction of the 14-azido group to give compounds of formula XV<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
b)	optional treatment with  an  acylating  or  alkylating  agent  to  give<br>
compounds of formula XVI<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br><br>
c)	cleavage of the C7 protective group and opening of the oxazolidine to<br>
give compounds of formula XIV.<br>
In the formulae XIV, XV and XVI, R3, R4, R5 and Re have the same meanings as defined above.<br>
For the envisaged therapeutical uses, compounds of formula III will be administered in the form of suitable pharmaceutical formulations, mainly through the parenteral route and at dosages in principle similar to those already used for some time in clinical practice with commercially available taxane derivatives (Paclitaxel and Docetaxel, for example).<br>
The following examples illustrate the invention in greater detail.<br>
Example 1<br>
7-Boc-13-ketobaccatin III<br>
A solution of 13-ketobaccatin III (1.10 g, 1.9 mmol) in CH2C12 (0.5<br>
mL) at 20°C is added with carbon tetrachloride (14 ml). Partial precipitation of the baccatin derivative takes place. Subsequently, 1-methylimidazole (23 uL, 0.28 mmol) and di-/erf-butyl-dicarbonate (1.03 g, 4.7 mmol) are added, under stirring and argon stream. After 8 hours, further 1-methyl-imidazole (16.0 uL, 0.20 mmol) is added. The solution is left at 25°C for 24 hours, then solvent is evaporated off under reduced pressure. The oily residue is dissolved in a 1:1 acetone/water mixture (10 mL) and left at 20°C for about 16 hours. The precipitate is filtered, washed with «-pentane and dried to give 1.12 g of of the title product. Chromatography of mother liquors affords a further 0.12 g of product (SiO2, n-hexane/EtOAc, 1.5:1.0). 1.24 g of product are thereby obtained (1.81 mmol, 95%).
