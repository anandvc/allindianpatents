Blends of Phosphates and Antioxidants Technical Field<br>
This invention pertains generally to synergistic blends of phosphates and hindered phenols with or without other additives as stabilizers for polymers. Background of the Invention<br>
The invention described herein pertains generally to synergistic blends of certain phosphates and hindered phenols as stabilizers for polymers. These blends may be used with other polymer additives.<br>
Various prior art references teach the incorporation of additives into organic polymeric materials. These additives can include polymer stabilizers such as antioxidants, UV absorbers and light stabilizers, metal deactivators, peroxide scavengers, basic co-stabilizers, lactones, nucleating agents, fillers and reinforcing agents, amino propionate derivatives, politicizes, lubricants, emulsifiers, pigments and dyes, optical brighteners, flame-proofing agents, antistatic agents, blowing agents, cross-linking agents, ant blocking agents, slip agents, processing aids, and thiosynergists.<br>
In particular, certain phosphites have been used in combination with hindered phenols as additives in polymers for stabilization against thermooxidative deterioration. What is illustrated in this invention are novel blends of phosphites and hindered phenols useful as polymer additives. The novel blends of phosphites and hindered phenols of this invention show superior performance in stabilizing polymers against thermooxidative deterioration as compared with prior art phosphite/ hindered phenol blends. Summary of the Invention<br>
In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a composition useful as a polymer additive comprising a blend of bias-{2,4-dicumylphenyl) pentaerythritol diphosphite, optionally, one or more additional phosphites, and one or more hindered phenols. As compared with prior art phosphite/hindered phenol blends, the blends of this invention show unexpectedly superior performance in stabilizing polymers against thermooxidative deterioration during processing as indicated by melt flow index.<br><br>
It is therefore an object of this invention to provide blends of phosphites and hindered phenols comprising bus-(2,4-dicumylphenyl) pentaerythritol diphosphite, said blends being useful, when added to polymers, as stabilizers against thermooxidative degradation during processing of a polymer composition comprising the polymer and the blend.<br>
In general, the present invention provides a composition which comprises bis-{2,4-dicumylphenyl) pentaerythritol diphosphite, optionally, at least one additional phosphite; and at least one hindered phenol antioxididant.<br>
This and other objects of this invention will be evident when viewed in light of the drawings, detailed description, and appended claims. Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
It has been discovered that blends of bus-{2,4-dicumylphenyl) pentaerythritol diphosphite (DOVERPHOS S-9228), optionally at least one additional phosphite, and at least one hindered phenol antioxidant provide better protection against polymer degradation during processing as evidenced by changes in melt flow and may provide better resistance to yellowing than do the current commercially available additive blends.<br>
A non-limiting list of exemplary additional phosphites that may be used in this invention would include tries-(2,4-di-t-butylphenyl) phosphite (DOVERPHOS S-480), distearyl pentaerythritol diphosphite (DOVERPHOS S-680), trisnonylphenyl phosphite (DOVERPHOS 4), phenyl disobey phosphite (DOVERPHOS 7), biphenyl isodecyl phosphite (DOVERPHOS 8), trephine phosphite (DOVERPHOS 10), treasury phosphite (DOVERPHOS 53), alkyl (C12-C15) biphenyl A phosphite (DOVERPHOS 613). alkyl (C10) biphenyl A phosphite (DOVERPHOS 675), bias-(2,4-di-t-butylphenyl) pentaerythritol diphosphite (ULTRANOX 626), 2-butyl-2-ethyl-1,3-propanediol 2,4,6-tri-t-butylphenol phosphite (ULTRANOX 641), bis-(2,6-di-t-butyl-4-methylphenyl) pentaerythritol diphosphite (PEP 36), testacies-(2,4-di-t-butylphenyl) 4,4'-diphenylenediphosphonite (P-EPQ), 2,2'-ethylidene bias-(4,6-di-t-butylphenyl)fluorophosphonite (ETHANOX 398), bis-(2,4-di-t-butyl-6-methylphenyl) ethyl phosphite (IRGAFOS 38) and 2,2',2"-nitrilotriethanol trigs[3,3',5,5'-tetra-tert-butyl-1,r-biphenyl-2,2'-diyl)-phosphite(IRGAFOS12).<br><br>
Preferred additional phosphites that may be used in conjunction with bis-(2,4-dicumylphenyl) pentaerythritol diphosphite are terraces-(2,4-di-t-butylph6nyl) 4,4'-diphenylenediphosphonite (P-EPQ) and tries-{2,4-di-t-butylphenyl) phosphite (DOVERPHOS S-480).<br>
A non-limiting exemplary list of hindered phenol antioxidants that may be used in this invention would include 2,6-di-t-butyl-4-methylphenol (BHT), 2,6-di-t-butyl-4-ethylphenol, tetra is [ethylene (3,5-di-t-butyl-4-hydroxhydrocinnamate)] methane (DOVERNOX 10), octadecyl 3,5-di-t-butyl-4-hydroxyhydrocinnamate (DOVERNOX 76), tries (3,5-di-t-butyl-4-hydroxybenzyl)-1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6(1H, 3H, 5H)-trine (DOVERNOX 3114), and a- tocopherol (Vitamin E).<br>

For blends of phosphites and hindered phenol antioxidants, the hindered phenol antioxidant is added in a synergistic amount, and the weight ratio of phosphite: hindered phenol antioxidant may be between about 100:1 to about 1:100. A preferred range is from about 20:1 to about 1:10. Two or more phosphites and two or more hindered phenol antioxidants may be blended together in order to make the phosphite/hindered phenol antioxidant blend.<br>
For blends comprising bis-(2,4-dicumyiphenyl) pentaerythritol diphosphite, additional phosphites, and hindered phenol antioxidants, the weight ratio of bis-{2,4-dicumylphenyl) pentaerythritol diphosphite to additional phosphites may be any ratio between about 10:1 to about 1 ;10. A preferred range is from about 4:1 to about 1:4. Blends of phosphites and more than one hindered phenol may be used. For example, BHT and tetrakis [ethylene (3,5-di-t-butyM-hydroxhydrocinnamate)] methane may be used in a weight ratio of about 1:1. Other examples of such mixtures are possible, and the weight ratio may be between about 10:1 and about 1:10.<br><br>
Preferred phosphite/hindered phenol antioxidant blends are blends of bis-(2,4-dicumy I phenyl) pentaerythritol diphosphite with tetrakis [ethylene (3,5-di-t-butyl-4-hydroxhydrocinnamate)] methane.<br>

The phosphite/hindered phenol antioxidant blend may be used in any concentration from about 10 ppm to about 10,000 ppm based on the total weight of the polymer and the additives, and the blends may be compounded into the polymers by methods known in the art.<br>
Examples<br>
The best mode for carrying out the invention will now be described for the purposes of illustrating the best mode known to the applicant at the time. The examples are illustrative only and not meant to limit the invention, as measured by the scope and spirit of the claims.<br>
Example 1<br>
This example compares blends of bis-(2,4-dlcumylphenyl) pentaerythritol diphosphite with a hindered phenol antioxidant.<br>
The blend comprised bis-(2,4-dicumylphenyl)pentaerythritol diphosphite.<br><br><br>
and a hindered phenol antioxidant. The Ingredients were thoroughly mixed to form the desired well-mixed blend.<br>
The hindered phenol used was tetrakis [methylene (3,5-di-t-butyl-4-hydroxyhydrocinnamate)] methane:<br><br>
tetrakis [methylene (3,5-di-t-butyl-4-hydroxyhydrocinnamate)] methane<br>
The following blends were prepared: Blend 1,<br>
bis-(2,4-dicumylphenyl)pentaerythritol diphosphite (2 parts) tetrakis [methylene {3,5-di-t-butyl-4-hydroxyhydrocjnnamate)] methane (1 part) Blend 2,<br>
bis-{2,4-dicumylphenyl)pentaerythritol diphosphite (1 part) tetrakis [methylene (3,5-di-t-butyl-4-hydroxyhydrocinnamate)] methane (1 part)<br><br>
These blends were then added to Prefix 6501 polypropylene at 1000 ppm along with 500 ppm of calcium separate and mixed to form a well-mixed polymer composition. The polymer composition was then subjected to multiple pass extrusion at 280 "C and 60 rpm using a Bartender PL 2000 single screw laboratory extruder. The melt flow (ASTM 1238) was measured after the first and fifth passes with a Tina’s Olsen extrusion lactometer. For comparison, two commercially available blends were also each mixed with polypropylene at 1000 ppm along with 500 ppm of calcium steerages, and the resulting polymer compositions were subjected to multiple pass extrusion at 280 C and 60 rpm.<br>
The commercially available blends were Iran B 215 FF, a 2:1 blend of tris-(2,4-di-t-butylphenyl) phosphite and tetrakis[methylene (3,5-di-t-butyl-4-hydroxhydrocinnamate)] methane, and Oreganos B 225 FF, a 1:1 blend of tris-(2,4-di-t-butylphenyl) phosphite and tetrakis[methylene (3,5-di-t-butyl-4-hydroxhydrocinnamate)] methane.   The results are given in Table 1.<br><br>
As can be seen in Table 1, both blend 1 and blend 2 provide a lower initial and final melt flow than do either of the commercially available blends. An increase in melt flow is indicative of polymer degradation. Therefore, blends 1 and 2 provide better protection against degradation that do the commercial blends.<br><br>
Example 2<br>
This example compares blends of bis-(2,4-dicumylphenyl) pentaerythritol diphosphite, a hindered phenol antioxidant, and a lactones with other blends. The following blends were prepared:<br>
Blend 3<br>
40 wt% bis-(2,4-dicumylphenyl) pentaerythritol diphosphite<br>
50 wt% tetrakisfmethylene (3,5-di-t-butyl-4-hydroxhydrocinnamate)] methane<br>
10 wt% 5,7-di-t-butyl-3-phenylbenzofuran-2-one<br>
Blend 4<br>
40 wt% bis-(2,4-di-t-butylphenyl) pentaerythritol diphosphite<br>
50 wt% tetrakisfmethylene (3,5-di-t-butyl-4-hydroxhydrocinnamate)] methane<br>
10 wt% 5,7-di-t-butyl-3-phenylbenzofuran-2-one<br>
Blend 5<br>
40 wt% tris (2,4-di-t-butylphenyl) phosphite<br>
50 wt% tetrakisfmethylene (3,5-di-t-butyl-4-hydroxhydrocinnamate)] methane<br>
10 wt% 5,7-di-t-butyl-3-phenylbenzofuran-2-one<br>
Blends 3, 4, and 5 were processed following the procedure of Example 1. The results are shown in Table 2.<br><br><br>
The results of Table 2 indicate superior 5-pass melt flow stability of Blend 3, which comprises bis-{2,4-dicumylphenyl) pentaerythritol diphosphite, as compared with the other blends.<br>
Discussion<br>
While the present invention has been directed to just a few stabilized polymer compositions which are primarily polyolefins, there is no need to limit it to such. In fact, any of the polymers known in the art, such as polyesters, polyurethanes, polyalkylene terephthalates, polysulfones, polyamides, polyphenylene ethers, styrene polymers, polycarbonates, acrylic polymers, polyamides, placental, halide containing polymers and polyolefin photopolymers and copolymers. Additionally included would be mixtures of different polymers, such as polyphenylene ether/styrene resin blends, polyvinyl chloride/ABS or other impact modified polymers, methacrylonitrile containing ABS, and polyester/ABS or polyester plus some other impact modifier may also be used. Such polymers are available commercially or may be made by means well known in the art. However, the phosphite/hindered phenol antioxidant blends of the present invention are particularly useful in thermoplastic polymers, such as polyolefins, polycarbonates, polyesters, polyphenylene ethers and styrene polymers, due to the extreme temperatures at which the thermoplastic polymers are often processed and/or used.<br><br>

Polymers based on acrylic acids, such as acrylic acid, met acrylic acid, methyl methacrylate acid and ethacrylic acid and esters thereof may also be used. Such polymers include polymethylmethacrylate, and ABS-type graft copolymers wherein all or part of the acrylonitrile-type monomer has been replaced by an acrylic acid ester or an acrylic acid amide. Polymers including other acrylic-type monomers, such as acrogenic, methacrolein, acryl amide and methacrylamide may also be used.<br>
