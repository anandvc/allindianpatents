				<th>Abstract</th>
				<td>The process enables highly effective N-halogenation of a compound having one or more halogenatable amido or imido functional groups in the molecule. The process involves, for example, concurrently feeding into a reactor (i) water, inorganic base, and the compound to be N-halogenated, e.g., a hydantoin, and a feed of (ii) a brominating agent and/or a chlorinating agent. The proportions of these feeds are such that the pH is kept at 5 or below or within a specified range e.g., 5.5-8.5 and one or more of the amido or imido nitrogen atoms is substituted by a bromine or chlorine atom. A feature of the process is that it can be conducted at elevated temperatures as high as about 90°C without appreciable thermal decomposition of reactants or product. The resultant product continuously precipitates in high yield and purity. Moreover, products can be produced that are very pale yellow to almost pure white in appearance. Further, the process has been found capable of producing l,3-dibromo-5,5-dimethylhydantoin with far larger particle sizes than previously produced on a commercial basis.</td>

TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0003] This invention relates to novel, highly efficient processes for the preparation of Nhalogenated<br>
amides or imides such as N-halogenated hydantoins, succinamides, succinimides,<br>
phthalamides, phthalimides, cyanuric acid, glycolurils, and the like. Preferred aspects of this<br>
invention relate to novel, highly efficient processes for the preparation of l,3-dihalo-5,5-<br>
dimethylhydantoins. As used herein, such terms as halogen, halogenated, and halo refer to<br>
bromine and/or chlorine.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0004] Various N-halogenated amides and imides are of known utility as chemical<br>
intermediates, as halogenating agents in organic syntheses, and as biocidal agents. See for<br>
example, U.S. PatNos. 2,868,787; 2,920,997; and 2,971,959.<br>
[0005] l,3-Dihalo-5,5-dialkylhydantoins, especially l,3-dibromo-5,5-dimethylhydantoin,<br>
l,3-dichloro-5,5-dimethylhydantoin, l-bromo-3-chloro-5,5-dimethylhydantoin,and 1-chloro-<br>
3-bromo-5,5-dimethylhydantoin, or mixtures of two or more of them, are biocidal agents for<br>
use in water treatment. These compounds are, in general, sparingly soluble in water. Each<br>
of these compounds except l,3-dibromo-5,5-dimethylhydantoin, has been supplied in<br>
compacted solid forms such as granules, tablets, or briquettes, and delivered into the water<br>
being treated by means of water flow through an erosion feeder.<br>
[0006] Over the years considerable effort has been devoted to the search for improved<br>
methods for producing N-halogenated amides or imides. In U.S. Pat. No. 2,971,960 Nbrominated<br>
compounds such as N-brominated 5,5-di-lower-alkyl hydantoins are formed by<br>
treating the alkylhydantoin with bromine in an acidic aqueous solution containing<br>
hypochlorite, preferably at a pH between 1 and 4. However, the method of choice has been<br>
halogenation of the alkylhydantoin in a basic aqueous medium. Almost invariably the<br>
halogen has been introduced into, or formed in situ in, the aqueous medium containing the<br>
alkylhydantoin. See in this connection U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,398,598; 2,779,764; 2,868,787;<br>
2,920,997; 2,971,959; 3,121,715; 3,147,259; 4,532,330; 4,560,766; 4,654,424; 4,677,130;<br>
4,745,189; WO 97/43264, published 20 November 1997; Orazi and Meseri, Andes Assoc.<br>
Quim. Argentina, 1949, 37, 192-196; Orazi and Meseri, Anales Assoc. Quim. Argentina,<br>
1950, 38, 5-11; Corral and Orazi, J. Org. Chem., 1963,23,1100-1104; Jolles, Bromine and<br>
its Compounds, Ernest Benn, London, 1966, p. 365; and Markish and Arrad, Ind. Eng. Chem.<br>
Res., 1995, 34,2125-2127.<br>
[0007] Shortcomings of prior processes for the N-halogenation of amides and imides<br>
include the requirement for careful temperature control (particularly in order to avoid sudden<br>
exotherms), long reaction times, foaming due to evolution of gases from decomposition of<br>
reactants and/or reaction products, and products of inconsistent quality.<br>
[0008] In the case of 1,3-dihalo-5,5-dimethylhydantoins, the provision of a process capable<br>
of producing the product as relatively large particles is a desirable objective. U.S. 4,745,189<br>
refers to formation of N,N'-bromochloro-5,5-dimethylhydantoin products comprising<br>
relatively large particles. Unfortunately, however, the process requires halogenation of<br>
dimethylhydantoin in an aqueous mixture under alkaline conditions in the presence of a<br>
halogenated alicyclic organic compound such as dichloromethane.<br>
[0009] It would be of considerable advantage if a new way could be found of producing Nhalogenated<br>
amides or imides while avoiding or at least minimizing the extent of the<br>
shortcomings referred to above. It would also be of great advantage if a way could be found<br>
of producing l,3-dihalo-5,5-dimethylhydantoins having larger average particle size than<br>
produced by methods known heretofore. Also it would be of considerable advantage if the<br>
production of a larger average particle size product could be accomplished without need for<br>
use of a halogenated organic solvent in the reaction mixture.<br>
[0010] Another advantage would be the provision of process technology which enables<br>
production in a single halogenation step or operation of "tailor-made" mixtures of 1,3-dihalo-<br>
5,5-dialkylhydantoins (preferably 1,3-dihalo-5,5-dimethylhydantoins) even if such mixtures<br>
are not always of larger average particle size. By "tailor-made" mixtures is meant that<br>
through control or regulation of the halogenation process, it is possible to produce a reaction<br>
product containing a mixture of l,3-dibromo-5,5-dialkylhydantoin together with N,N'-<br>
bromochloro-5,5-dialkylhydantoin(s) and optionally l,3-dichloro-5,5-diaIkylhydantoin in<br>
which proportions of these halogenated products in the mixture can be controlled so as to be<br>
within predetermined experimental limits. Some of these mixtures are new, and are useful<br>
as cost-effective biocides especially for water treatment applications.<br>
[0011] This invention is deemed to fulfill these objectives in a most effective and efficient<br>
manner.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0012] In accordance with this invention processes are provided which are characterized<br>
by high efficiency, uniform product consistency, good product color, and efficient utilization<br>
of reactants. In addition, this invention makes possible the conduct of exothermic Nhalogenation<br>
reactions without use of costly refrigeration. Moreover, the processes of this<br>
invention can be run in a batch mode, in a semi-batch mode, or in a continuous mode, and in<br>
any such mode it is possible, when producing products devoid of chromophoric groups, to<br>
obtain high yields of very pale yellow to almost pure white products. And no haloorganic<br>
solvent or co-solvent of any kind is required in the processes of this invention.<br>
[0013] Furthermore, this invention makes possible the production of l,3-dihalo-5,5-<br>
dimethylhydantoins with large average particle sizes without use of any halogenated solvent<br>
or co-solvent in the process. For example, l,3-dibromo-5,5-dimethylhydantoin with an<br>
average particle size of at least 175 microns can now be readily formed pursuant to this<br>
invention. In fact, 1,3-dibromo-5,5-dimethylhydantoin, with an average particle size of over<br>
300 microns has been produced using a process of this invention. As will be seen hereinafter,<br>
measurements carried out on samples of several commercially-available l,3-dibromo-5,5-<br>
dimethylhydantoins obtained from different commercial sources showed that the largest<br>
average particle size of these commercial products was only about 162 microns.<br>
[0014] One of the embodiments of this invention is a process for the N-halogenation of a<br>
compound having in the molecule at least one halogenatable amido or imido nitrogen atom.<br>
The process comprises concurrently, or substantially concurrently, feeding (a) a compound<br>
having in the molecule at least one N-halogenatable amido or imido nitrogen atom, (b) an<br>
inorganic base, (c) a brominating agent and/or a chlorinating agent, and (d) water, where (a),<br>
(b), (c), and (d) are fed individually and/or in any combination(s) whereby the feeds come<br>
together in a reaction zone. In addition, (a), (b), (c), and (d) are fed in proportions such that<br>
at least one such amido or imido nitrogen atom is substituted by a bromine or chlorine atom,<br>
thereby forming product which precipitates in an aqueous reaction mixture, and such that the<br>
pH of the aqueous reaction mixture is continuously or substantially continuously maintained<br>
in the range of about 5.5 to about 8.5 during all or substantially all of the time such feeding<br>
is occurring.<br>
[0015] Another embodiment involving the N-halogenation of a compound having in the<br>
molecule at least one halogenatable amido or imido functional group is a another concurrent<br>
feeding process. In this case, there are at least two separate but concurrent or substantially<br>
concurrent feeds to a reactor. One such feed is a brominating agent or a chlorinating agent.<br>
One or more other separate feeds deliver to the reactor a compound having in the molecule<br>
at least one N-halogenatable amido or imido nitrogen atom, an inorganic base, and water. A<br>
preferred process of this embodiment comprises concurrently feeding into in a reaction zone:<br>
A) separate feeds of (i) an aqueous solution or slurry formed from an inorganic base and<br>
a compound having in the molecule at least one halogenatable amido or imido<br>
nitrogen atom, and (ii) a brominating agent and/or a chlorinating agent; or<br>
B) at least three separate feeds, one of which is a brominating agent and/or a chlorinating<br>
agent, and at least two other feeds, at least one of which is selected from (a) and (b);<br>
and at least one of which is selected from (c) and (d), wherein<br>
(a) is an aqueous solution or slurry formed from an inorganic base,<br>
(b) is an aqueous solution or slurry formed from an inorganic base and a<br>
compound having in the molecule at least one halogenatable amido or imido<br>
nitrogen atom,<br>
(c) is a compound having in the molecule at least one halogenatable amido or<br>
imido nitrogen atom, and<br>
(d) is an aqueous solution or slurry formed from a compound having in the<br>
molecule at least one halogenatable amido or imido nitrogen atom;<br>
in proportions such that at least one such amido or imido nitrogen atom is substituted<br>
by a bromine or chlorine atom, thereby continuously or substantially continuously<br>
forming product which precipitates in an aqueous reaction mixture continuously or<br>
substantially continuously, during all or substantially all of the time the concurrent<br>
feeding is occurring, and such that the pH of the mixture is continuously or<br>
substantially continuously maintained in the range of about 5.5 to about 8.5 during all<br>
or substantially all of the time the concurrent feeding is occurring.<br>
[0016] Another preferred process for the N-halogenation of a compound having at least one<br>
halogenatable amido or imido functional group in the molecule is one in which there are in<br>
essence two separate feeds to effect the desired reaction. Such process comprises<br>
concurrently feeding separate feeds into a reaction zone so that the feeds form, or continue<br>
to form, a reaction mixture. These separate feeds are composed of (i) an aqueous solution or<br>
slurry formed from an inorganic base and a compound having in the molecule at least one<br>
halogenatable amido or imido nitrogen atom, and (ii) a brominating agent and/or chlorinating<br>
agent in proportions such that at least one such amido or imido nitrogen atom is substituted<br>
by a bromine or chlorine atom and the resultant product precipitates continuously or<br>
substantially continuously in an aqueous reaction mixture during all or substantially all of the<br>
time the concurrent feeding is occurring, and such that the pH of the mixture is continuously<br>
or substantially continuously maintained in the range of about 6.5 to about 8.5.<br>
[0017] A particularly preferred group of reactants used in the practice of this invention is<br>
comprised of the 5-hydrocarbyl and especially the 5,5-dihydrocarbyl hydantoins. Of these<br>
reactants the 5,5-dialkylhydantoins are even more preferred. Accordingly, still another<br>
preferred embodiment of this invention is a process for the production of a l,3-dihalo-5,5-<br>
dimethylhydantoin, which process comprises concurrently feeding into contact with each<br>
other feed streams of (i) water, inorganic base, and 5,5-dimethylhydantoin, these being fed<br>
separately and/or in any combination(s), and (ii) a separate feed of a brominating agent and/or<br>
a chlorinating agent, in proportions such that l,3-dihalo-5,5-dimethylhydantoin is formed in<br>
an aqueous reaction mixture in which the pH of such mixture is continuously or substantially<br>
continuously maintained in the range of about 6.5 to about 8.5, and where the l,3-dihalo-<br>
dimethylhydantoin precipitates during all or substantially all of the time the concurrent<br>
feeding is occurring.<br>
[0018] Another preferred process of this invention is a process in which the N-halogenation<br>
is conducted on a semi-batch or more preferably on a continuous basis. Such process<br>
comprises:<br>
I) concurrently and continuously feeding into a reactor containing an aqueous reaction<br>
mixture:<br>
A) separate feeds of (i) an aqueous solution or slurry formed from an inorganic<br>
base and a compound having in the molecule at least one halogenatable amido<br>
or imido nitrogen atom, and (ii) a brominating agent and/or a chlorinating<br>
agent; or<br>
B) at least three separate feeds, one of which is a brominating agent and/or a<br>
chlorinating agent, and at least two other feeds, at least one of which is<br>
selected from (a) and (b); and at least one of which is selected from (c) and<br>
(d), wherein<br>
(a) is an aqueous solution or slurry formed from an inorganic base,<br>
(b) is an aqueous solution or slurry formed from an inorganic base and a<br>
compound having in the molecule at least one halogenatable amido or<br>
imido nitrogen atom,<br>
(c) is a compound having in the molecule at least one halogenatable<br>
amido or imido nitrogen atom, and<br>
(d) is an aqueous solution or slurry formed from a compound having in<br>
the molecule at least one halogenatable amido or imido nitrogen atom;<br>
in proportions such that at least one such amido or imido nitrogen atom is substituted<br>
by a bromine or chlorine atom and a precipitate of the resultant product precipitates<br>
in an aqueous reaction mixture during all or substantially all of the time the<br>
concurrent feeding is occurring, and such that the pH of the reaction mixture is<br>
continuously or substantially continuously maintained in the range of about 5.5 to<br>
about 8.5; and<br>
II) periodically or continuously removing precipitate and a portion of the reaction<br>
mixture from the reactor.<br>
[0019] When using a brominating agent in any of the above processes, it is possible<br>
pursuant to this invention to recover the bromine values produced as bromide in the process.<br>
Such an operation can improve the overall process economics. One such embodiment of the<br>
invention comprises:<br>
a) concurrently feeding into a reactor (i) water, inorganic base, and a compound having<br>
in the molecule at least one halogenatable amido or imido nitrogen atom, these<br>
components being fed separately and/or in any combination(s), and (ii) a separate feed<br>
of a brominating agent, in proportions such that (iii) at least one such amido or imido<br>
nitrogen atom is substituted by a bromine atom, (iv) the product continuously or<br>
substantially continuously precipitates in an aqueous reaction mixture in which the<br>
pH is continuously or substantially continuously maintained in the range of about 5.5<br>
to about 8.5, and (v) an aqueous solution of co-product inorganic bromide salt is<br>
formed;<br>
b) separating precipitate from the aqueous solution; and<br>
c) oxidizing co-product inorganic bromide salt in the solution to form elemental<br>
bromine.<br>
[0020] Preferably the pH in each of the above embodiments is maintained in the range of<br>
about 6.5 to about 8.5. It is particularly preferred to conduct the above processes while<br>
maintaining the pH within the range of about 6.8 to about 7.2, especially when the Nhalogenatable<br>
reactant is a hydantoin.<br>
[0021] As noted above, each process of this invention can be conducted in a batch mode,<br>
in a semi-batch mode, or in a continuous mode.<br>
[0022] Other embodiments and features of the invention will become still further apparent<br>
from the ensuing description and appended claims.<br>
FURTHER DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0023] This invention is applicable to the N-halogenation of a wide variety of compounds<br>
having at least one halogenatable amido or imido nitrogen atom in the molecule. Thus, the<br>
compound may contain only a single halogenatable functionality or it may contain a plurality<br>
of such halogenatable functional groups. Moreover, the compound may contain both<br>
halogenatable amido functionality and halogenatable imido functionality in the molecule.<br>
Among typical N-halogenatable compounds that can be utilized in the process of this<br>
invention are such compound types as hydantoins, succinamides, succinimides, phthalamides,<br>
phthalimides, cyanuric acid, glycolurils, oxazolidinones, sulfonamides, barbiturates,<br>
imidazolinones, ureas, oxazoles, and the like. For ease of reference such compounds are<br>
sometimes referred to hereinafter as N-halogenatable compounds.<br>
[0024] Throughout this disclosure the term "N-halogenatable" with reference to reactions<br>
involving amido groups (where the nitrogen atom can have two hydrogen atoms as<br>
substituents thereon), refers to removal from the nitrogen atom of either one hydrogen atom<br>
or both hydrogen atoms being subjected to deprotonation and halogenation, unless the context<br>
expressly indicates that only one of such hydrogen atoms is to be removed or that both such<br>
hydrogen atoms are to be removed.<br>
[0025] In most cases the processes of this invention will be applied to the N-halogenation<br>
of N-halogenatable amides, especially cyclic amides, or to the N-halogenation of Nhalogenatable<br>
imides, especially cyclic imides. However, of the N-halogenatable compounds,<br>
the hydantoins are preferred. More preferred are 5-hydrocarbyl and 5,5-dihydrocarbyl<br>
hydantoins. Particularly preferred hydantoins are the 5-alkyl and 5,5-dialkyl hydantoins,<br>
especially those in which each alkyl group contains up to about 6 carbon atoms. Still more<br>
preferred are 5,5-dialkyl hydantoins in which each alkyl group contains, independently, up<br>
to 3 carbon atoms. Most especially preferred is 5,5-dimethylhydantoin.<br>
[0026] A wide variety of inorganic bases are suitable for use in the process of this<br>
invention. Typically these are water-soluble basic salts or oxides of an alkali metal or an<br>
alkaline earth metal. Preferred bases include sodium oxide, sodium hydroxide, sodium<br>
carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, potassium oxide, potassium hydroxide, potassium carbonate,<br>
potassium bicarbonate, calcium oxide, calcium hydroxide, or a mixture of any two or more<br>
of them.<br>
[0027] Reactions pursuant to this invention can be carried out with various proportions of<br>
water, inorganic base, and N-halogenatable compound. When the inorganic base has a<br>
monovalent cation, the feeds should be controlled and maintained such that per liter of water<br>
being fed, there are from about 0.5 to about 2.5 moles of halogenatable amido and/or imido<br>
8<br>
nitrogen atoms to be deprotonated and from about 0.5 to about 2.5 moles of the base. On the<br>
other hand, when the inorganic base has a divalent cation, the feeds should be controlled and<br>
maintained such that per liter of water being fed, there are about 0.5 to about 2.5 moles of<br>
halogenatable amido and/or imido nitrogen atoms to be deprotonated, and from about 0.25<br>
to about 1.25 moles of the base.<br>
[0028] In preferred embodiments the proportions among water, inorganic base, and Nhalogenatable<br>
compound being fed are as follows:<br>
A) where the inorganic base has a monovalent cation, there are per liter of water, from<br>
about 1.0 to about 1.5 moles of halogenatable amido and/or imido nitrogen atoms and<br>
from about 1.0 to about 1.5 moles of the base; and<br>
B) where the base has a divalent cation, there are per liter of water, about 1.0 to about 1.5<br>
moles of halogenatable amido and/or imido nitrogen atoms and from about 0.5 to<br>
about 0.75 moles of the base.<br>
[0029] When conducting the preferred embodiments of this invention involving use of a<br>
5,5-dialkylhydantoin, particularly 5,5-dimethylhydantoin, the proportions of water, inorganic<br>
base, and 5,5-dimethylhydantoin being fed should be such that when using an inorganic base<br>
having a monovalent cation, there can be from about 0.5 to about 2.5 moles of 5,5-<br>
dimethylhydantoin and from about 1.0 to about 5.0 moles of the base, per liter of water being<br>
fed, and preferably from about 1.0 to about 1.5 moles of 5,5-dimethylhydantoin and from<br>
about 2.0 to about 3.0 moles of the base, per liter of water being fed. When using an<br>
inorganic base having a divalent cation, there can be from about 0.5 to about 2.5 moles of <br>
dimethylhydantoin and from about 0.5 to about 2.5 moles of the base, per liter of water being<br>
fed, and preferably about 1.0 to about 1.5 moles of 5,5-dimethylhydantoin and from about 1.0<br>
to about 1.5 moles of the base, per liter of water being fed.<br>
[0030] In order to achieve the best results, the amount of base used is the stoichiometric<br>
quantity, or is substantially the stoichiometric quantity, theoretically required to deprotonate<br>
the nitrogen atom of at least one imido group of the N-halogenatable compounds, or to fully<br>
or partially deprotonate the nitrogen atom of at least one amido group of such compounds.<br>
Thus, if the N-halogenatable compound has but one halogenatable imido group in the<br>
molecule (and no halogenatable amido group), the amount of the base used will be sufficient<br>
to fully deprotonate the nitrogen atom of that imido group. Similarly, in the case of an Nhalogenatable<br>
compound having 2 or more halogenatable imido groups hi the molecule the<br>
amount of base used will be sufficient to deprotonate as many of the nitrogen atoms of such<br>
imido groups as is desired. In the case of an N-halogenatable compound having a single<br>
halogenatable amido group in the molecule (/. e., a group of the formula -CO-NH2), the<br>
amount of the base used can either be the amount sufficient to partially deprotonate such<br>
nitrogen atom (whereby monohalogenation is achieved on the nitrogen atom) or to fully<br>
deprotonate such nitrogen atom (whereby dihalogenation is achieved on the nitrogen atom).<br>
With N-halogenatable compounds having two or more halogenatable amido groups in the<br>
molecule, the amount of the base used can be such as to deprotonate to the desired extent one<br>
or more of such amido nitrogen atoms. When the N-halogenatable compound contains at<br>
least one halogenatable amido group and at least one halogenatable imido group (e.g., as in<br>
the case of a hydantoin), it is possible to selectively deprotonate the nitrogen atom of the<br>
imido group without significantly affecting the amido group. This is accomplished by<br>
employing an amount of the base stoichiometrically required to deprotonate the nitrogen atom<br>
of the imido group (i.e., the functional group having the greater acidity). Alternatively, it is<br>
possible to deprotonate the nitrogen atom of the imido group and the nitrogen atom of the<br>
amido group by use of an amount of base sufficient to deprotonate the nitrogen atoms of both<br>
such groups.<br>
[0031] The water, inorganic base, and the N-halogenatable compound can be fed<br>
individually or in any combination or mixture. However, it is advantageous to feed the<br>
inorganic base as an aqueous solution either with or without the co-presence of the Nhalogenatable<br>
compound. In this way, the heat generation that occurs when dissolving a base<br>
in water takes place prior to the introduction of such solution of aqueous base into the<br>
reaction zone. Most preferably, an aqueous solution of the inorganic base is formed, and to<br>
this solution is added the N-halogenatable compound. Such a procedure not only safeguards<br>
against excessive heat generation which might otherwise adversely affect the N-halogenatable<br>
compound, but simplifies the feeding operation and control of the proportions being fed. For<br>
best results, it is desirable to employ feed solutions having in the range of about 0.5 to about<br>
2.5 moles of the N-halogenatable compound per liter of water. In forming such solutions, use<br>
of aqueous alkaline solutions in the range of about 0.5 to about 5.0 moles of base per liter of<br>
water is preferred.<br>
[0032] In the practice of this invention, halogenation of the N-halogenatable compound is<br>
accomplished by use of a brominating agent and/or a chlorinating agent. Thus use can be<br>
made of bromine, chlorine, bromine chloride, bromine and chlorine, a bromide salt and<br>
chlorine and/or a source of hypochlorite anion, or an organic brominating or organic<br>
chlorinating agent such as N-bromosuccinimide, N-chlorosuccinimide, or pyridiniurn<br>
10<br>
tribromide, and the like. Of these halogenating agents, bromine, chlorine, bromine chloride,<br>
bromine and chlorine, a bromide salt and chlorine and/or a source of hypochlorite anion are<br>
preferred. Particularly preferred are bromine and mixtures of bromine and chlorine (which<br>
will include or consist of bromine chloride). Without desiring to be bound by theoretical<br>
considerations, it is believed that the actual species which carry out the halogenation in the<br>
Q aqueous reaction mixture can include, for example, one or more of Br2, C12, BrCl, OBr ,<br>
, and Br® Whatever the actual halogenating species may<br>
be, the important thing is to feed to the aqueous reaction mixture a suitable halogenating<br>
agent that results in N-halogenation of at least one nitrogen atom of an amido or imido group<br>
of the compound being halogenated.<br>
[0033] If both bromine and chlorine are used, they can be fed as separate feeds.<br>
Alternatively, they can be premixed in any desired proportions whereby the mixture being fed<br>
will contain bromine chloride, and if mixed in molar proportions other than 1:1, will also<br>
contain the halogen used in excess. In lieu of chlorine, an alkali or alkaline earth metal<br>
hypochlorite can be used as the chlorine source. Typically the hypochlorite salt will be fed<br>
in the form of an aqueous solution or slurry. However, it is also possible to feed a solid<br>
hypochlorite salt such as calcium hypochlorite directly into the aqueous reaction mixture.<br>
When bromination is desired, the feed can be an alkali metal bromide or an alkaline earth<br>
metal bromide, and a source of chlorine, such as chlorine or an aqueous solution or slurry of<br>
an alkali or alkaline earth metal hypochlorite, such as sodium hypochlorite solution, in<br>
amounts sufficient to generate bromine in situ. It is also possible to feed a solid hypochlorite<br>
salt such as calcium hypochlorite to the aqueous reaction mixture in order to generate the<br>
bromine in situ. Usually feeds of this type will result in formation of products containing<br>
both bromine and chlorine in the molecule. While in principle other sources of bromine or<br>
chlorine may be used, such as organic compounds containing loosely bound bromine or<br>
chlorine, the use of such organic halogenating agents is not preferred as their use can<br>
complicate product workup and recovery operations. Moreover, such organic halogenating<br>
agents tend to be more expensive than such sources as bromine or chlorine, or sodium<br>
bromide and chlorine.<br>
[0034] The bromine or chlorine should be fed subsurface to the aqueous phase in the<br>
reaction zone so as to ensure intimate contact with the N-halogenatable compound being<br>
used. When using an alkali metal bromide or an alkaline earth metal bromide and chlorine<br>
to generate bromine in situ, the bromide salt can be fed as a separate feed, typically as a water<br>
solution, or it can be fed along with an aqueous solution or slurry formed from the watersoluble<br>
base and the N-halogenatable compound. In any such case, the chlorine used<br>
therewith should be fed subsurface to the aqueous phase in the reaction zone.<br>
[0035] Chlorine will typically be fed into the reaction mixture as a liquid, but can be fed in<br>
the vapor state, if desired. Bromine can be fed into the reaction mixture either as a gas or as<br>
a liquid. Preferably the bromine is fed in the vapor state subsurface to the liquid phase of the<br>
aqueous reaction mixture, and it is desirable to so feed the gaseous bromine in admixture with<br>
an inert gas such as nitrogen or argon.<br>
[0036] Although it is desirable and preferred to feed diatomic halogens (C12, Br2, BrCl, or<br>
mixtures thereof, and where the C12 itself is being used as the chlorinating agent or is being<br>
used in combination with a bromine source such as an alkali metal bromide and/or an alkaline<br>
earth bromide) subsurface to the liquid phase of the aqueous reaction mixture, other ways of<br>
accomplishing the feeding can be used. One other way is to feed vaporous diatomic halogen<br>
into a headspace of a reactor while spraying aqueous reaction mixture and/or spraying or<br>
misting water into intimate contact with such vapors within the reactor. Other ways of<br>
establishing intimate contact of the diatomic halogen with the remainder of the components<br>
from which the aqueous reaction mixtures is formed include feeding the halogen as a liquid<br>
and/or as a solution into the aqueous reaction mixture, and in such case the halogen can be<br>
fed above the surface of the aqueous reaction mixture, if desired. In short, this invention<br>
contemplates the feeding of the halogen in any conceivable way that accomplishes the<br>
objective of bringing the components into intimate contact with each other so that the<br>
intended N-halogenation reaction will occur. In all cases, agitation of the aqueous reaction<br>
mixture is advantageous.<br>
[0037] It is to be noted that when the term "subsurface" is used anywhere in this document,<br>
including the claims, the term does not denote that there must be a headspace in the reaction<br>
zone. For example, if the reaction zone is completely filled with the aqueous reaction mixture<br>
(with equal rates of incoming and outgoing flows), the term "subsurface" means in this case<br>
that the substance being fed subsurface is being fed directly into the body of the aqueous<br>
reaction mixture, the surface thereof being defined by the enclosing walls of the reaction<br>
zone.<br>
[0038] In this connection, in one of the embodiments of this invention, the N-halogenatable<br>
compound, inorganic base, brominating agent and/or chlorinating agent, and water can be fed<br>
either individually and/or in any combination(s) including a combination of all such<br>
components. If all such components are fed in combination with each other, this can result<br>
in these components coming together outside of a typical reactor or reaction vessel. In<br>
practicing such feeding, the components can initially be brought into contact with each other<br>
in a mixing device in proximity to, but apart from, such reactor or reaction vessel. Suitable<br>
mixing devices include a static mixer, a conduit (preferably a conduit in which there is<br>
turbulent flow), or a jet mixer that produces a high velocity effluent stream. In all such cases,<br>
the mixing device itself in which all of the foregoing components first come into contact with<br>
each other is part of the reaction zone.<br>
[0039] The processes of this invention can be conducted in any of a variety of modes of<br>
operation. For example, the processes can be carried out in a batch mode, in a semi-batch<br>
mode with constant overflow, in a semi-batch mode without overflow, or in a continuous<br>
mode. The engineering details concerning such modes of process operation are well known<br>
in the art, as witness, for example, Perry's Chemical Engineer's Handbook, 4th Edition,<br>
McGraw-Hill, copyright 1963.<br>
[0040] In a continuous operation, usually and preferably, the effluent from the mixing<br>
device in which all of the foregoing components are first brought together is fed into a larger<br>
volume reactor or reaction vessel containing a body of the aqueous reaction mixture. Since<br>
reaction will begin essentially as soon as the foregoing components come into contact with<br>
each other, reaction will usually commence in such mixing device and will continue in the<br>
aqueous reaction mixture in the reactor or reaction vessel, which of course is also part of the<br>
reaction zone. Thus, it is desirable to place the mixing device, when using a mixing device,<br>
in close proximity to the larger volume reactor or reaction vessel and to move the components<br>
rapidly into, through, and from the mixing device and into a larger volume of aqueous<br>
reaction mixture in the larger reactor or reaction vessel. In this way, the time between initial<br>
contact among all of the components and the time when the aqueous reaction mixture comes<br>
into contact with a larger volume of the aqueous reaction mixture is kept short enough so that<br>
the temperature of the reaction mixture at any stage of the operation does not exceed about<br>
90°C, and preferably does not exceed about 70°C. If desired, the mixing device, if used, can<br>
be cooled by indirect heat exchange with a cooling or refrigerated fluid.<br>
[0041 ] When using a conduit with turbulent flow therein as the mixing device, such conduit<br>
can itself constitute the entire reactor or reaction vessel in a continuous operation. In other<br>
words, the reactor or reaction vessel itself can be a tubular reactor of sufficient length and<br>
volume for the reaction and precipitate formation to occur therein.<br>
[0042] Preferably, the reactants are concurrently fed into a reaction zone composed of at<br>
least one reactor in which all of the components ~ whether fed individually or in any<br>
subcombination(s) - all come together for the first time and in which the N-halogenation<br>
reaction is initiated and carried out.<br>
[0043] Preferably the concurrent feeds in the processes of this invention are continuous<br>
feeds. It is also preferable that the feeds are co-feeds — i.e., two feeds are utilized, namely<br>
(i) an aqueous solution or slurry formed from an inorganic base and a compound having in<br>
the molecule at least one halogenatable amido or imido nitrogen atom, and (ii) a brominating<br>
agent and/or chlorinating agent. However, it is also within the scope of this invention to<br>
conduct a tri-feed or other multi-feed process. Indeed, it is possible to utilize, for example,<br>
both a co-feed and a tri-feed although such an operation offers no particular advantage. In<br>
all cases, the feeds are proportioned such that at least one amido or imido nitrogen atom in<br>
the molecule is substituted by a bromine or chlorine atom. Product formation occurs almost<br>
immediately upon the reaction components coming in contact with each other, and if no<br>
solids-containing heel or solids-free mother liquor from a prior reaction is used, precipitation<br>
begins shortly thereafter. Once precipitation has commenced, product formation and<br>
precipitation occur continuously or substantially continuously during the concurrent feeds.<br>
When a solids-containing heel or solids-free mother liquor from a prior reaction is used, the<br>
precipitation begins almost immediately and continues to occur continuously or substantially<br>
continuously during the concurrent feeds. The feeds are proportioned such that the pH in the<br>
aqueous reaction mixture is maintained or substantially continuously maintained in the range<br>
of about 5.5 to about 8.5, preferably in the range of about 6.5 to about 8.5, and most<br>
preferably in the range of about 6.8 to about 7.2. In conducting the process, the materials in<br>
the concurrent feeds should rapidly come into intimate contact with each other. Thus, it is<br>
preferred to introduce the separate, but concurrent feeds, in close or relatively close proximity<br>
to each other and to provide sufficient agitation to cause such rapid intimate contact and<br>
resultant interaction among the components being fed.<br>
[0044] In conducting the processes of this invention, observations to date indicate that the<br>
reaction and precipitate formation are extremely fast. When no solids-containing heel or<br>
solids-free mother liquor from a prior reaction is used, the slight delay in the commencement<br>
of precipitate formation at the beginning of the concurrent feeds is believed to be simply the<br>
time required for the aqueous reaction mixture to become suitably saturated with the product.<br>
When a solids-containing heel or solids-free mother liquor from a prior reaction is used, little<br>
or no delay occurs in the commencement of precipitate formation at the beginning of the<br>
concurrent feeds. Because the rapidity of the reaction, upon termination of the concurrent<br>
feeds, precipitation may continue to occur in the aqueous reaction mixture for only a very<br>
short period of time.<br>
[0045] The use of the term "concurrent" does not exclude the possibility of inconsequential<br>
interruptions taking place during the feeds. Nor does this term imply that the feeds must start<br>
at exactly the same moment in time. In the case of a co-feed process, the two feeds can be<br>
initiated with an interval of time between such initiation as long as the interval is sufficiently<br>
short as to cause no material adverse effect upon the overall process. Likewise in the case of<br>
a tri-feed or multi-feed operation, there may be one or two different time intervals between<br>
or among the respective feeds, again provided that the time intervals are of sufficiently short<br>
duration to cause no material adverse effect upon the overall process.<br>
[0046] The processes of this invention, whether performed in a batch mode, semi-batch<br>
mode, or continuous mode, are preferably conducted so that such things as the feeds, reaction,<br>
precipitate formation, and maintenance of specified pH occur "continuously" during the<br>
reaction. However, it cannot be stressed strongly enough that one must not gain the<br>
impression that inconsequential interruption in one or more of such things cannot occur.<br>
Interruptions which do not materially affect the conduct of the process are not excluded from<br>
the scope of this invention. To safeguard against hypertechnical legalistic word<br>
interpretation, it has been deemed prudent to employ terms such as "substantially<br>
continuously" in describing this invention. But whatever the terms used, the process should<br>
be conducted as one of ordinary skill in the art would carry out the processes after a thorough,<br>
unbiased reading of this entire disclosure and in keeping with the spirit of the invention<br>
gained from such a reading.<br>
[0047] When conducted in a batch mode or when initiating a semi-batch or continuous<br>
process, it is preferred, although not required, to initially charge to the empty reactor either<br>
a solids-containing heel of a reaction mixture from a prior reaction in which the product to<br>
be formed had been formed or a solids-free mother liquor from such a prior reaction. Such<br>
heel or mother liquor typically has a pH in the range of about 6 to about 7, and usually<br>
contains up to 2 wt% of the product and/or a precursor thereof. Then the concurrent, suitablyproportioned<br>
feeds are initiated, typically at room temperature, and precipitate formation<br>
commences almost immediately, and in any event within a few minutes. In a batch operation,<br>
the feeds are typically continued until the reactor has been, or until the reactors have been,<br>
filled to the desired level. Usually at this point, the feeds are terminated, and the Nhalogenated<br>
product which has formed and precipitated is recovered, typically by filtration,<br>
centrifugation, or decantation. Since the reaction is exothermic and rapid, long ride periods<br>
at the end of the feeding are normally unnecessary.<br>
[0048] When operating in a continuous mode and once the continuous feeds have been<br>
initiated, the feeds may be adjusted in fine tuning the operation so as to establish and maintain<br>
the desired operating conditions for the steady-state operation. Such operation typically can<br>
be conducted without mishap for long periods of time before shutdown, e.g., for plant<br>
maintenance.<br>
[0049] It can be seen therefore, whether operating in a batch mode, a semi-batch mode, or<br>
in a continuous mode, the initiation of the reaction with the utilization of a heel or mother<br>
liquor enables the more rapid achievement of efficient, steady-state operation than if a heel<br>
or mother liquor is not employed.<br>
[0050] When feeding the brominating agent and/or chlorinating agent into the reactor, best<br>
results are achieved when such halogen source is introduced directly into the body of liquid<br>
within the reactor, /'. e., below the surface of the heel or mother liquor when starting up the<br>
reaction and below the surface of the aqueous reaction mixture once the reaction has<br>
commenced. This will minimize the possibility of some of the halogen remaining in the<br>
headspace in the reactor and thus not participating in the reaction. Also feeds subsurface to<br>
the liquid phase of the reactor contents avoid splattering which can occur when, for example,<br>
liquid bromine strikes the surface of an aqueous mixture.<br>
[0051] In a batch operation the aqueous reaction mixture is largely created and increased<br>
in volume by the feeds. In operations conducted in the batch, semi-batch, or continuous<br>
mode, it is highly desirable to vigorously agitate the reaction mixture to ensure thorough<br>
mixing of the reaction components.<br>
[0052] Because of the short reaction and precipitation times which are features of processes<br>
of this invention, it is possible, indeed preferred, to conduct the processes in a semi-batch<br>
mode, and more preferably in a continuous mode. This in itself is a rarity, as the literature<br>
on N-halogenation of amides or imides is replete with teachings involving only batch<br>
operations. In the continuous mode, reactor size can be substantially reduced without a loss<br>
in product output.<br>
[0053] If the reaction is performed in a reactor of sufficient size, the volume of the reactor<br>
contents can be cycled between predetermined low and high volumes with initiation of rapid<br>
draining when the volume reaches the high volume of reactor contents, and with discontinued<br>
draining once the volume reaches the low volume of reactor contents. However, it is<br>
preferred to conduct the process so that the volume of the contents of the reactor and the<br>
volume of the precipitate and portion of the reaction mixture removed from the reactor are<br>
equal or substantially equal whereby the volume of reactor contents remains constant or<br>
substantially constant. In this way, reactors with smaller volumes can be employed.<br>
[0054] Thus, once steady-state conditions have been achieved in a continuous reactor, the<br>
separate feeds can be fed in appropriate proportions on a continuous basis, and the reactor<br>
contents maintained under the appropriate reaction conditions for virtually unlimited periods<br>
of time. Concurrently, a portion of the reaction mixture including precipitate (which mixture<br>
typically is in the form of a slurry) is being removed, usually and preferably continuously,<br>
from the reaction mixture so that the volume of the contents of the reactor remains more or<br>
less constant.<br>
[0055] Another feature of this invention is that the co-product is a relatively pure aqueous<br>
saline solution, thus minimizing environmental and disposal problems. Moreover, when<br>
using bromine as the halogen and an alkali or alkaline earth metal salt or oxide as the base in<br>
the process, the resultant co-product is an aqueous solution of alkali or alkaline earth metal<br>
bromide from which bromine can be recovered by oxidation of bromide ion to elemental<br>
bromine, for example by treatment of the solution with chlorine.<br>
[0056] In typical, properly conducted batch operations, during at least about 80% of the<br>
period of time the separate feeds are being fed concurrently, and preferably during at least<br>
about 90% of the foregoing period of time, precipitate is being formed that typically is<br>
essentially pure product (e.g., with a purity of at least about 97%, and often as much as 99.9%<br>
purity). Also, typically the desired product is formed in a yield of at least about 80%, and<br>
often as high as 94% or more, based on the amount of the compound having at least one<br>
halogenatable amido or imido nitrogen atom used in the reaction. In typical, properly<br>
conducted continuous operations, once steady-state operation has been achieved, precipitate<br>
is continuously being formed that (a) also typically has a purity of at least about 96%, and<br>
often as much as 99.9%, and (b) typically is formed in a substantially continuous yield of at<br>
least about 85% based on the amount of the compound having at least one halogenatable<br>
amido or imido nitrogen atom being fed as a reactant in the process.<br>
[0057] When properly conducted, the processes of this invention can produce 1,3-dihalo-<br>
5,5-dimethylhydantoins with an average particle size of at least about 200 microns, and often<br>
significantly larger than this.<br>
[0058] If bromine is to be generated in situ, this is best accomplished by reaction between<br>
a suitable oxidant, preferably chlorine, and a bromine source such as a water-soluble alkali<br>
or alkaline earth metal bromide.<br>
[0059] The processes of this invention can be carried out in various ways, such as in a batch<br>
mode, in a semi-batch mode, or, preferably, in a continuous mode. When conducting a<br>
continuous operation, it is desirable to design the operation such that the average residence<br>
time falls within the range of about 15 to about 100 minutes, and preferably in the range of<br>
about 30 to about 60 minutes. As with all of the numerical ranges given herein, departures<br>
therefrom are permissible whenever deemed necessary or desirable, provided only that such<br>
departures do not materially detract from the efficacy and effectiveness of the process.<br>
[0060] An important feature of this invention is the concurrent feeding of the separate feeds<br>
referred to above. It is again to be emphasized that the term "concurrent" does not imply that<br>
the feeds must start at exactly the same time or that they must stop at exactly the same period<br>
of time. Rather, the term is used in the sense that during substantially the entire reaction<br>
period, the designated feeds are being maintained. It should also be understood that while<br>
these concurrent feeds are preferably continuous concurrent feeds, slight interruptions in a<br>
feed are acceptable provided that the duration of the interruption is sufficiently small as to<br>
cause no material disruption in the reaction. Thus as used herein, the terms "concurrent" and<br>
"continuous" should be understood to embrace the minor departures just referred to.<br>
Naturally, those skilled in the art will strive to utilize the concurrent feeds with as little<br>
nonconcurrence as possible. Likewise, those skilled in the art will of course seek to maintain<br>
the continuous feeds with as few interruptions as possible under the given circumstances in<br>
which the operation is being conducted. However, because the reaction mixtures are<br>
generally capable of standing for days without material change in composition, it is possible<br>
to interrupt an uncompleted operation (whether conducted in a batch mode, in a semi-batch<br>
mode, or in a continuous mode) for long periods of time should this become necessary.<br>
18<br>
[0061] Another highly important feature of this invention is the maintenance of the correct<br>
pH in the aqueous reaction mixture throughout substantially the entire reaction period. Here<br>
again, it is possible for slight departures to occur in the pH, particularly at the outset of the<br>
reaction. Such departures are within the ambit of this invention provided of course that no<br>
material adverse effects are encountered as a result of such departures. As noted above, the<br>
processes of this invention are typically conducted at a pH within the range of about 5.5 to<br>
about 8.5, and preferably in the range of about 6.5 to about 8.5. However, for best results the<br>
pH is most preferably maintained within the range of about 6.8 to about 7.2.<br>
[0062] To maintain the desired pH in the aqueous reaction mixture, the rates at which the<br>
feeds of the base and the halogenating agent play an important role. In particular, the halogen<br>
should be fed or generated in situ at a rate insufficient to depress the pH below the desired<br>
level (e.g., 5.5, or preferably 6.5, or most preferably 6.8). In other words, the feed of halogen<br>
or the generation of halogen in situ should not be such as to decrease the pH (increase the<br>
acidity) of the reaction mixture to a pH significantly below about 5.5 for any substantial<br>
period of time. Likewise, the base, whether fed singly, as an aqueous solution of base, or in<br>
admixture with water and the N-halogenatable compound, should be fed at a rate insufficient<br>
to increase the pH above the desired level (e.g., 8.5 or preferably 7.2). Thus, the feeds should<br>
be suitably coordinated so as to maintain the pH of the reaction mixture within the ranges<br>
specified herein.<br>
[0063] While on the subject of pH control, some additional points are worthy of<br>
consideration. First of all, operations at low pH (i.e., in the range of about 5.5 to about 6.5)<br>
while technically feasible, are less desirable from an economic standpoint because an<br>
unnecessarily excessive amount of the halogen is present in the reaction mixture. In addition,<br>
it is possible that some depreciation in product quality may be encountered under such more<br>
acidic conditions. On the other hand, operations in which the pH drifts above about 8.5 for<br>
any significant length of time are not desirable because in general the solubility of the desired<br>
product in the aqueous reaction mixture tends to increase under such elevated pH conditions.<br>
Under idealized operating conditions, which seldom, if ever, can be achieved in plant scale<br>
operations, the process would be conducted at precisely a pH of 7.0. However, as a practical<br>
matter, deviation from such ideal condition will inevitably be encountered. Thus, in finetuning<br>
an operation utilizing a process of this invention, one should strive to provide<br>
throughout at least most of the reaction time, a very slight stoichiometric excess of the<br>
halogen source relative to the N-halogenatable compound to ensure achievement of complete<br>
halogenation to the desired level. For example, if monohalogenation of an N-halogenatable<br>
compound having more than one halogenatable nitrogen atom is desired, it is preferable to<br>
maintain in the reaction mixture during substantially the entire time the feeds are being<br>
carried out slightly more than one equivalent of the halogen relative to the N-halogenatable<br>
compound. Similarly, if multi-halogenation of an N-halogenatable compound having more<br>
than one halogenatable nitrogen atom is desired, in order to minimize underhalogenation,<br>
slightly more than the number of equivalents of halogen atoms to be introduced into the Nhalogenatable<br>
compound should be employed, and should be maintained in the reaction<br>
mixture during substantially the entire time the feeds are being carried out.<br>
[0064] The proportions of brominating agent and/or chlorinating agent relative to the Nhalogenatable<br>
compound should be such that there are in the range of about 1.9 to about 2.1<br>
atoms of the halogen per halogenatable amido or imido nitrogen atom to be halogenated.<br>
Thus in the case of 5,5-dihydrocarbylhydantoins such as 5,5-dimethylhydantoin the<br>
proportions concurrently being fed to the reaction zone are such that there are in the range of<br>
about 3.8 to about 4.2 atoms of halogen per molecule of the 5,5-dialkylhydantoin. As<br>
previously noted, under ideal conditions the number of atoms of halogen per amido or imido<br>
nitrogen atoms to be halogenated would be precisely that amount required to produce the<br>
desired product without any deviation whatsoever from the selected stoichiometry. The fact<br>
that the foregoing ranges dip below and extend above such an ideal ratio simply reflects the<br>
fact that under actual large scale plant operating conditions, one can operate at slightly below<br>
the ideal ratio or slightly above the ideal ratio without material adverse effect relative to the<br>
optimum results achievable under such conditions. To the extent possible, it is preferable to<br>
operate with a slight excess of the halogen relative to the N-halogenatable compound in the<br>
reaction mixture (i.e., in the range of about 2.0 to about 2.1 atoms of halogen per<br>
halogenatable amido or imido nitrogen atom to be halogenated) rather than operating<br>
continuously in the range of about 2.0 to about 1.9. This ensures full halogenation to the<br>
extent desired without use of excessive halogen and consequent loss of raw materials.<br>
[0065] Thus, when using bromine or generating bromine in situ and forming a product of<br>
white coloration such as 1,3-dibromo-5,5-dimethylhydantoin, a convenient way of monitoring<br>
the rate of bromine addition or generation is to feed or generate the bromine at a rate such that<br>
the color of the reaction mixture is bright yellow to reddish yellow. The appearance of a<br>
reaction mixture having a reddish coloration would indicate that an excessive amount of<br>
bromine is present. Other ways of monitoring the halogen present can be used if desired,<br>
such as by use of pH meters, chemical pH indicators, and/or the like. Also the halogen feed<br>
or generation can be monitored by combinations of any two or more suitable methods for<br>
determining pH, such as a combination of color observations as described earlier in this<br>
paragraph, and use of one or more pH meters, concurrently or sequentially, or in any other<br>
suitable manner. If a combination of two or more ways of measuring pH are used, and if by<br>
chance disparate pH measurements result, one should rely upon the method previously<br>
determined in actual practice to give the most accurate and reproducible results. Use of<br>
carefully calibrated commercially-available pH meters is currently believed to be one of the<br>
most reliable ways of determining pH, but it is not intended that the scope of this invention<br>
be limited to use of pH meters.<br>
[0066] Still another feature of this invention is that the concurrent feeding of the<br>
components enables the maintenance within the reactor of an aqueous reaction mixture of<br>
sufficiently low concentration that the reaction can be conducted at elevated temperatures<br>
(e.g., 40 to about 90°C) without material decomposition of most N-halogenatable compounds<br>
or the N-halogenated products thereof, depending of course upon the thermal decomposition<br>
temperature of the particular compound being utilized. In sharp contrast, heretofore it has<br>
been commonplace to cool the reactor to temperatures as low as about 5°C in order to<br>
ameliorate the problem of decomposition due to presence of excessive base in the system to<br>
which the halogen is added. Pursuant to this invention, it is preferred when operating in a<br>
continuous mode to feed the components from which the aqueous reaction mixture is<br>
composed in amounts such that the ratio of (i) the volume of the aqueous reaction mixture in<br>
liters to (ii) the moles of N-halogenatable compound being fed to the reaction mixture per<br>
minute is in the range of about 10 to about 100 liters per mole per minute, and preferably in<br>
the range of about 30 to about 60 liters per mole per minute. Similarly, when operating in a<br>
batch mode wherein the feeds are to at least one reactor, until the volume of the reaction<br>
mixture reaches 50 percent of the total volume of the reactor(s), the feeds to the reaction<br>
mixture are maintained such that the ratio of (i) the volume of the reaction mixture in liters<br>
to (ii) the moles of the N-halogenatable compound being fed to the reaction mixture per<br>
minute is in the range of about 10 to about 100 liters per mole per minute, and preferably in<br>
the range of about 20 to about 80 liters per mole per minute. Then, when the volume of the<br>
reaction mixture is 50 percent or more of the total volume of the reactor(s), the feeds to the<br>
reaction mixture are such that the ratio of (i) the volume of the reaction mixture in liters to<br>
(ii) the moles of the N-halogenatable compound being fed to the reaction mixture per minute<br>
is in the range of about 30 to about 60 liters per mole per minute. By operating a continuous,<br>
semi-batch, or batch process using the foregoing ratios, the N-halogenatable compound and<br>
the N-halogenated derivative thereof are less susceptible at essentially neutral pH conditions<br>
(e.g., 6.8-7.2) to thermal decomposition from the heat of reaction.<br>
[0067] In conducting the processes of this invention, the reaction temperatures can be varied<br>
within a reasonable range. Typically, the reaction temperature will fall within the range of<br>
about 0 to about 90°C although under some conditions departures from this temperature range<br>
may prove acceptable under particular circumstances. Oftentimes temperatures in the range<br>
of about 20 to about 80°C or 90°C will be found more efficacious. However, temperatures<br>
within the range of about 30 to about 70°C are generally preferred inasmuch as reactions<br>
performed at these temperatures tend to produce products in the highest yields. It is most<br>
preferred to perform the reaction at temperatures in the range of about 40 to about 60°C,<br>
especially when utilizing a hydantoin such as 5,5-dimethylhydantoin, and bromine as the<br>
halogen source. Temperatures in the range of about 40 to about 60°C are most preferred<br>
because operations conducted within this range produce product of large particle size in high<br>
yield at fast reaction rates and in the most cost-effective manner. When conducting the Nhalogenation<br>
reaction at temperatures above the boiling temperature of the halogen being fed,<br>
it is desirable to feed the halogen subsurface to the liquid phase of the aqueous reaction<br>
mixture. In such a case, it is particularly desirable to feed the halogen diluted with an inert<br>
gas.<br>
[0068] Typically the aqueous reaction mixtures of this invention will be formed, in essence,<br>
from four types of components, viz., the N-halogenatable compound, the brominating agent<br>
and/or chlorinating agent, the inorganic base, and water. Although it is preferable to<br>
minimize the number of components in the aqueous reaction mixture, it is possible to include<br>
one or more additional components in such mixtures, provided of course that such other<br>
component(s) cause(s) no material deleterious effect on the reaction or precipitate formation.<br>
For example, while not ordinarily recommended, it is possible to include certain organic<br>
solvents, especially water-miscible organic solvents in the aqueous reaction mixture. Such<br>
organic solvent(s) should be in proportions that do not result in a disproportionately large<br>
amount of the desired N-halogenated end product remaining in solution, unless of course the<br>
solvent is to be subsequently removed, for example, by distillation. At least one potentially<br>
beneficial use of an organic solvent involves periodically including one or more organic<br>
solvents in the feeds to the reaction zone of the process being operated in a continuous mode<br>
in order to dissolve or dislodge encrustations of precipitate that may have built up in the<br>
reaction zone. If an organic solvent is to be included in the aqueous reaction mixture, besides<br>
not unduly affecting the intended N-halogenation reaction adversely, in the usual situation<br>
the solvent should not consume bromine or chlorine. Also, the solvent should not react with<br>
the intended N-halogenation product, should not interfere with the in situ generation of<br>
bromine (if such is being used), and should not result in formation of an unworkable or overly<br>
pasty or sticky precipitate or, in general have any other material adverse effect upon the<br>
conduct or further conduct of the process. A few examples of organic solvents that may be<br>
considered for use areN.N-dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide, one or more CM alkanols,<br>
tetrahydrofuran or other saturated ethers, or the like. Therefore, unless expressly stated<br>
otherwise, the term "aqueous reaction mixture" as used anywhere in this document, including<br>
the claims, does nor exclude the presence of one or more organic solvents, provided no<br>
material adverse effect upon the reaction or precipitate formation or product characteristics<br>
is caused by the presence of such solvent(s) in the amount in which present relative to the<br>
total amount of the overall reaction mixture.<br>
[0069] The components of the reaction mixture should be agitated to a sufficient extent so<br>
as to avoid localized concentrations of either halogen or base. Thus, for example, in<br>
laboratory scale operations, stirring rates in the range of about 300-600 rpm have been found<br>
desirable for achieving good mixing within the reaction vessel. In plant scale operations use<br>
of a continuously stirred reactor is thus recommended.<br>
[0070] Yet another feature of this invention is the fact that the processes can be conducted<br>
adiabatically without material reduction in reactor throughput. Thus even when the process<br>
is conducted without adding heat energy into the reaction mixture and without recourse to<br>
refrigeration, or use of a flowing liquid heat transfer agent, or other ways of cooling (except<br>
possibly for normal unassisted heat transfer through the reactor walls to the surrounding<br>
atmosphere), the heat buildup from the exothermic reaction can be readily controlled without<br>
materially reducing feed rates. Such control can be achieved by maintaining a dilute aqueous<br>
reaction mixture, e.g., by operating a continuous, semi-batch, or batch process using the ratios<br>
of volume of reaction mixture to moles of N-halogenatable compound being fed per minute<br>
as described hereinabove. Despite such dilution, the reaction and precipitate formation<br>
nonetheless can proceed rapidly under such adiabatic conditions.<br>
[0071] Even though adiabatic operation is possible, when conducting the processes of this<br>
invention, especially in a continuous mode, it is preferred to utilize a flow of cooling water<br>
or other heat exchange liquid for indirect heat exchange with the reactor contents to ensure<br>
maintenance of steady-state temperature conditions in the reaction mixture. If desired,<br>
however, the processes of this invention can be conducted using refrigeration.<br>
[0072] From the foregoing it can be seen that this invention involves an interrelationship<br>
among controllable reaction variables which result in the production of high quality products<br>
in high yield in rapid reactions. Thus, this invention features, inter alia, concurrent feeds of<br>
the reaction components with specified control of pH by means of feed rates. In preferred<br>
embodiments, adjustment and control of temperature enables rapid formation of product in<br>
high yield and with large particle size. Also, utilization of reaction mixtures in highly diluted<br>
conditions contributes materially, in preferred embodiments, to high yields and allows greater<br>
flexibility in operating temperatures. Moreover, the rapid precipitate formation under steadystate<br>
conditions makes possible the use of short residence times in continuous operations, and<br>
thus contributes materially to improved plant throughput.<br>
[0073] As can be readily seen from the Examples hereinafter, this invention makes possible<br>
the provision of l,3-dihalo-5,5-dimethylhydantoins with large average particle sizes. For<br>
example, by use of this invention it is now possible to produce l,3-dibromo-5,5-<br>
dimethylhydantoin particulate solids having an average particle size of at least about 175<br>
microns. In fact, l,3-dibromo-5,5-dimethylhydantoin particulate solids having an average<br>
particle sizes of greater than 200, 300, and even as much as over 500 microns have been<br>
obtained by use of the present process technology. So far as is known, despite the ability to<br>
produce some hydantoin compounds comprised of large particles, l,3-dibromo-5,5-<br>
dimethylhydantoin with an average particle size of 175 microns or greater has not been<br>
produced heretofore. Moreover, the l,3-dihalo-5,5-dimethylhydantoins produced by<br>
processes of this invention are devoid of traces of organohalide solvent residues inasmuch as<br>
these products are formed in the absence of any halogenated organic solvent such as<br>
methylene chloride.<br>
[0074] Because this invention enables the direct production of l,3-dibromo-5,5-<br>
dimethylhydantoin reaction products in which the recovered l,3-dibromo-5,5-<br>
dimethylhydantoin particulate solids have an average particle size of at least 175 microns,<br>
several very substantial advances in the art are made possible. For example, it has been<br>
discovered that 1,3-dibromo-5,5-dimethylhydantoin particulate solids having average particle<br>
sizes above 175 microns:<br>
a) are far easier to handle because of their much lower dusting tendencies;<br>
b) have flow properties through pipes and conduits and from hoppers that are far<br>
superior;<br>
c) could be pressure compacted into shape-retentive tablets without use of a binder and<br>
without breakage occurring, whereas samples of commercially-available 1,3-dibromo-<br>
5,5-dimethylhydantoin particulate solids from several different sources could not be<br>
converted into tablets in the same manner without breakage occurring.<br>
[0075] These and related discoveries are described in detail in commonly-owned copending<br>
Application No. 09/484,687 referred to above.<br>
[0076] The following Examples are presented to illustrate the practice of, and advantages<br>
made possible by, this invention. These Examples are not intended to limit, and should not<br>
be construed as limiting, the scope of this invention to the particular operations or conditions<br>
described therein. In each run of Examples 1-10 and in Example 13, pH was monitored by<br>
use of a pH meter, and bromine was fed using a Cole-Farmer Masterflex computerized drive<br>
®<br>
and Easy-Load pump head. When conducting the continuous operations of Examples 9 and<br>
10, the resulting reaction slurry was collected manually and intermittently from the bottom<br>
of the reactor. Each fraction was collected in a 500 mL flask.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
[0077] 235 Grams'of NaOH (5.85 mol) are dissolved in 1800g of water, and 375g of <br>
dimethylhydantoin (2.93 mol) is added to the NaOH solution. There are 935g of Br2 (5.85<br>
mol) in the bromine reservoir. A 1-liter jacketed flask into which the Br2 and the 5,5-<br>
dimethylhydantoin/NaOH solution are fed is maintained at 25°C with a cooling bath. The<br>
5,5-dimethylhydantoin/NaOH solution is co-fed to the reaction flask simultaneously with, but<br>
separately from, Br2. The feed of the 5,5-dimethylhydantoin/NaOH solution was initiated<br>
shortly before (e.g., 3-4 min.) the initiation of the Br2 feed. The feed rate of the 5,5-<br>
dimethylhydantoin/NaOH solution is 10 mL/minute, and the feed rate of the Br2 is 1.60-1.70<br>
mL/minute. The reaction mixture is stirred with a mechanical stirrer at a rate of 3 50-400 rpm.<br>
During the reaction, the pH ranged from 7.4 to 7.9. The slurry that forms as the reaction<br>
progresses is collected at a rate such that the level of the solution in the reaction flask remains<br>
constant. 500 mL fractions of product are collected through the bottom of the reaction flask,<br>
in an average time of 30 minutes per fraction. When the 5,5-dimethylhydantoin/NaOH<br>
solution feed is finished, 86g of Br2 (0.54 mol) remains in the bromine reservoir.<br>
[0078] Each product fraction is filtered and washed with three 500 mL portions of<br>
water, and the solid is then dried under a stream of nitrogen. The isolated yield of 1,3-<br>
dibromo-5,5-dimethylhydantoin is 673g, a yield of 80% based on 5,5-dimethylhydantoin, or<br>
a yield of 89% based on Br2. The active bromine content is at least 99%, as determined by<br>
iodometric titration.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
[0079] 44 Grams of NaOH (1.1 mol) are dissolved in 338g of water, and 70.4g of 5,5-<br>
dimethylhydantoin (0.55 mol) is added to the NaOH solution. There are 175.Ig of Br2 (1.1<br>
mol) in the bromine reservoir. The reaction flask into which the Br2 and the 5,5-<br>
dimethylhydantoin/NaOH solution are fed is maintained at 35°C with a heating bath. The<br>
reaction flask is charged with-200 mL heel (238g) of a l,3-dibromo-5,5-dimethylhydantoin<br>
filtrate (mother liquor). The 5,5-dimethylhydantoin/NaOH solution is co-fed to the reaction<br>
flask simultaneously with, but separately from, Br2. The reaction mixture is stirred with a<br>
mechanical stirrer at a rate of 400 rpm. During the reaction, the pH ranged from 6.9 to <br>
The reaction temperature stabilized at 37°C during the 0.5 hour addition time. When the<br>
addition of reagents is finished, the orange slurry is filtered at 35°C and washed with 650 mL<br>
of water. The resultant white solid is dried overnight under a stream of nitrogen. The isolated<br>
yield of 1,3-dibromo-5,5-dimethylhydantoin is 147.6g, a yield of 94%, and the active bromine<br>
content of the l,3-dibromo-5,5-dimethylhydantoin is 55.1 wt% (98.6% of the theoretical<br>
value), as determined by iodometric titration.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
[0080] 44 Grams of NaOH (1.1 mol) are dissolved in 338g of water, and 70.4g of 5,5-<br>
dimethylhydantoin (0.55 mol) is added to the NaOH solution. There are 172.Og of Br2 (1.07<br>
mol) in the bromine reservoir. The reaction flask into which the Br2 and the 5,5-<br>
dimethylhydantoin/NaOH solution are fed is maintained at 67°C with a heating bath. The<br>
reaction flask is charged with-200 mL heel (238g) of a l,3-dibromo-5,5-dimethylhydantoin<br>
filtrate (mother liquor). The 5,5-dimethylhydantoin/NaOH solution is co-fed to the reaction<br>
flask simultaneously with, but separately from, Br2. The bromine is diluted with nitrogen and<br>
fed below the surface of the solution in the reaction flask. The reaction mixture is stirred with<br>
a mechanical stirrer at a rate of 400 rpm; the pH ranged from 6.7 to 7.1 during the reaction.<br>
During the 0.5 hour addition time, the reaction temperature stabilized at 67°C. When the<br>
addition of reagents is finished, the orange slurry is discharged from the reaction flask into<br>
a beaker and allowed to cool slowly. The slurry is filtered at -45 °C and washed with two 500<br>
mL portions of water. The resultant white solid is dried overnight under a stream of nitrogen.<br>
The isolated yield of l,3-dibromo-5,5-dimethylhydantoin is 130.5g, a yield of -83% based<br>
on 5,5-dimethylhydantoin, or a yield of-85% based on Br2. The active bromine content of<br>
the l,3-dibromo-5,5-dimethylhydantoin is 55.9 wt% (100% of the theoretical value), as<br>
determined by iodometric titration. Particle size data on the l,3-dibromo-5,5-<br>
dimethylhydantoin product formed in this operation based on a representative dried sample<br>
of the product are summarized in Table 1.<br>
(Table Removed)   [0081] 354 Grams of NaOH (8.85 mol) are dissolved in 2700g of water. 562g of 5,5-<br>
dimethylhydantoin (4.386 mol) is added to the NaOH solution. The reaction flask is charged<br>
with 500 mL heel of a l,3-dibromo-5,5-dimethylhydantoin filtrate (mother liquor). The <br>
dimethylhydantoin/NaOH solution is co-fed to the jacketed reaction flask, no heating or<br>
cooling is applied simultaneously with, but separately from, Br2. The feed rate of the 5,5-<br>
dimethylhydantoin/NaOH solution is 10 rnL/minute, and the feed rate of the Br2 is initially<br>
1.70 mL/minute, but is adjusted later to 1.68 mL/minute to maintain the pH of the reaction<br>
mixture at -7.0. The reaction mixture is stirred with a mechanical stirrer at a rate of 400 rpm<br>
reaction temperature is stabilized at about 42°C. The slurry that forms as the reaction<br>
progresses is collected at a rate such that the level of the solution in the reaction flask remains<br>
constant. Eight 500 mL fractions of product were collected through the bottom of the<br>
reaction flask, in an average time of 30 minutes per fraction. A total of 1374.5g of Br2 <br>
mol) are added during the reaction.<br>
[0082] Each product fraction is filtered and washed with a 500 mL portion of water; the<br>
solids are then dried overnight at 50°C in a vacuum oven. The total isolated yield of 1,3-<br>
dibromo-5,5-dimethylhydantoin is 1152g, a yield of 92% based on 5,5-dimethylhydantoin,<br>
or a yield of 94% based on Br2. The active bromine content of the l,3-dibromo-5,5-<br>
dimethylhydantoin ranges from 55.4 wt% to 55.7 wt% (99.1% to 99.7% of the theoretical<br>
value), as determined by iodometric titration. The average particle size of the 1,3-dibromo-<br>
5,5-dimethylhydantoin is greater than 150|j..<br>

of water. The resultant white solid is dried overnight under a stream of nitrogen. The isolated<br>
yield of 1,3-dibromo-5,5-dimethylhydantoin is 144.8g, a yield of 94% based on Br2, and 92%<br>
based on 5,5-dimethylhydantoin; the active bromine content of the l,3-dibromo-5,5-<br>
dimethylhydantoin is 55.0 wt% (98.4% of the theoretical value), as determined by iodometric<br>
titration.<br>
[0088] The particle size data for the products of Examples 7 and 8 are summarized in Table (Table Removed)<br>
[0089] The process of this Example was conducted in a continuous fashion. A feed solution<br>
of 5,5-dimethylhydantoin/NaOH was formed by adding 5,5-dimethylhydantoin to a 9 wt%<br>
NaOH solution, such that the 5,5-dimethylhydantoin concentration was about 1.1 M. The 5,5-<br>
dimethylhydantoin/NaOH solution was co-fed to the reaction flask simultaneously with, but<br>
separately from, Br2. The flask was suspended in a heating bath. The reaction mixture was<br>
stirred with a mechanical stirrer at a rate of 500 rpm. The reaction mixture was maintained<br>
at a pH of about 7.0±0.2, and the reaction temperature was maintained at 55°C. Ten fractions<br>
of product were collected in an average time of 30 minutes per fraction. The isolated yield<br>
of the l,3-dibromo-5,5-dimethylhydantoin was 90% based on 5,5-dimethylhydantoin, and<br>
92% based on added Br2. The purity of the l,3-dibromo-5,5-dimethylhydantoin, a white<br>
crystalline product, was 99.8%, based on the theoretical bromine content. Fractions 5-10<br>
represent the particle size of the product as formed during steady-state operating conditions.<br>
Table 4 summarizes average particle size data and particle size distribution data relating to<br>
fractions 5-10 based on samples of each such fraction taken during the steady-state operation<br>
of the continuous process. The determinations showed that a bimodal distribution of the<br>
product had been produced. The overall average particle size of the product was 512.3<br>
(Table Removed)  [0093] Another continuous operation was performed using a glass reactor into which were<br>
concurrently fed, on a continuous basis, an aqueous solution formed from 5,5-<br>
dimethylhydantoin and NaOH, and a separate feed of bromine. The aqueous solution was<br>
made by adding 5,5-dimethylhydantoin to an aqueous 9 wt% NaOH solution. This solution<br>
contained about 22.4 wt% of 5,5-dimethylhydantoin and 7 wt% NaOH. A one liter, jacketed<br>
reactor having an interior diameter of 82 millimeters equipped with an anchor agitator, with<br>
an outer diameter of 72 millimeters, was used, and a silicone fluid (Rhodersil 4720V20 fluid;<br>
Rhone-Poulenc) was circulated through the jacketing. The temperature of the reaction was<br>
controlled at 38°C. Both feeds were controlled by pumps; the average feed rate of the 5,5-<br>
dimethylhydantoin/NaOH solution was 15.84 grams/minute via a Prominent Gamma G/4A<br>
positive displacement pump, and the average feed rate of the bromine was 4.67 grams/minute<br>
via a Masterflex Easy-Load peristaltic pump. The reaction mixture was stirred at 400 rpm.<br>
The pH of the reaction was monitored by measuring the pH of the effluent using a pH meter,<br>
and the pH ranged from 6.06 to 6.36 during the reaction. Product removal from the reactor<br>
was also controlled by a pump. Residence time was, on average, 30 minutes per fraction;<br>
each fraction was about 500 mL. A yield of 90.5% of l,3-dibromo-5,5-dimethylhydantoin<br>
was obtained, based on the amount of 5,5-dimethylhydantoin fed to the reactor. The active<br>
bromine content of the l,3-dibromo-5,5-dimethylhydantoin was &gt;55.3%, as determined by<br>
standard iodometric titration. Thus, the purity of this product was greater than 99.0%.<br>
[0094] Table 9 summarizes particle size data on the l,3-dibromo-5,5-dimethylhydantoin<br>
product formed in the continuous operation of Example 13. These data are averaged data<br>
based on two samples taken at different times during the continuous operation once steady<br>
state conditions, or essentially steady state conditions, had been achieved.<br>
(Table Removed)  [0095] In Examples 14-18 liquid bromine (Aldrich) is fed subsurface into the reaction<br>
mixture. Both liquid bromine and the DMH/NaOH solutions are pumped into the reactor<br>
using Cole-Farmer Masterflex computerized drive (2 pump heads, 1 to 60 rpm) and<br>
Easy-Load pump head. For bromine, Viton tubing is used in connection with Teflon. For the<br>
DMH/NaOH solution, C-Flex tubing is used. Chlorine gas is bubbled into the reaction slurry,<br>
also subsurface. The NaOH solutions are made using regular tap water, then allowed to cool<br>
down to room temperature before adding the DMH to make a clear solution.<br>
[0096] For the continuous run (Example 18), fractions (residence times) were collected<br>
manually such that the reactor level was maintained constant. Each fraction (typically 500<br>
mL) was filtered and the original filtrate was analyzed within days. The solid was washed<br>
with tap water. Drying was carried out in filtration funnel under nitrogen or in vacuum oven<br>
at ~55°C. Co-feeding the reagents was monitored by use of a pH meter. The starting DMH<br>
(97%) was purchased from Aldrich. All reactions were carried out in a 4-neck 1-L jacketed<br>
glass flask. The reactor was equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a thermocouple, and a pH<br>
meter. The resulting reaction slurry was collected manually and intermittently from the<br>
bottom of the reactor. Each fraction was collected in a 500 mL flask.<br>
[0097] The following analytical procedures were used in connection with Examples 14-<br>
DBDMH or BCDMH particle size was determined by use of Coulter LS particle size analyzer<br>
with typical run time of 1 minute per sample. The purity of the bromine content of both solid<br>
DBDMH and its filtrate was determined by iodometric titration. Proton NMR spectra were<br>
obtained in dry CD2C12 on a Bruker/GE Omega 400WB. The spectra were broadband C-13<br>
decoupled to eliminate 13C satellites. The residual proton resonance of the deuterated solvent<br>
36<br>
was assigned to 5.32 ppm. Normalized wt% of the brominated and chlorinated species were<br>
calculated. The BCDMH was analyzed by 'H-NMR, in dried deuterated methylene chloride,<br>
to determine the isomers ratio. Each chemical sift represented the gem dimethyl group (6 H,<br>
s) in the hydantoin molecule.<br>
EXAMPLE 14<br>
Batch Trifeed Operation at 53°C, pH~ 6-8<br>
[0098] Into a 4-neck 1-L jacketed glass flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer (400 rpm),<br>
a thermocouple, and a pH meter and heated via a circulating bath, are charged a 200 mL heel<br>
of 5% NaCl solution. A solution of 5,5-dimethylhydantoin (DMH) is prepared by dissolving<br>
44.5 g (1.11 mol) of NaOH in 339 g of water, and after cooling to room temperature, DMH<br>
(70.4 g, 0.549 mol) is added. The DMH solution is fed at 10.0 mL/min rate while the<br>
bromine is fed at -0.80 mL/min subsurface. Chlorine is also co-fed subsurface in a rate such<br>
that the pH of the mixture ranges between 6 and 8. The reaction temperature is about 53°C.<br>
When the DMH feed ends, about 86.4 g of bromine is consumed (0.540 mol, -98% of the<br>
bromine needed for total DMH bromination). The total amount of chlorine consumed is in<br>
the vicinity of about 0.8 mol. During the 44 minutes of the trifeed, a yellow to orange color<br>
persisted on the top of the reaction slurry. After filtering and washing the product with water,<br>
an off white solid (149.4 g, -96% yield) was obtained. Filtrate analysis indicated the<br>
presence of -0.2 wt.% of active bromine, -0.3 wt% of bromide, and -7.2% of chloride.<br>
Analytical data are summarized in Table 10. DBDMH was obtained in &gt;98% purity with<br>
no dichloro species and only -1 wt% of BCDMH.<br>
EXAMPLE 15<br>
Batch Trifeed Operation 52°C, pH ~ 5-7<br>
[0099] The reagents are prepared as in Example 14 and the process is carried out similarly<br>
except that the pH of the slurry is kept between 5-7 (mostly between 5-6) by faster bubbling<br>
of the chlorine. About 87.7 g of bromine is consumed (0.548 mol, which is ~99 % of the<br>
bromine needed for total DMH bromination) during the 38 minutes of the trifeed. Chlorine<br>
added during the trifeed is -40.5 g (0.571 mol). The reaction slurry is mostly yellow, but at<br>
the end of addition a reddish color appears on the reaction surface and the slurry turns yellow<br>
when it reaches room temperature. After work up and drying, an off white solid (149.2 g,<br>
-95%) is obtained. Analytical data are summarized in Table 10. DBDMH purity is -92%<br>
with formation of 7 wt% of BCDMH and a trace of the 1,3-dichloro species.<br>
(Table Removed) Batch Trifeed Operation at 53°C, pH~6-7<br>
[0100] Into a heated 4-neck 1-L jacketed glass flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer (400<br>
- 475 rpm), a thermocouple, and a pH meter was charged 200 mL heel of 5% NaCl solution.<br>
DMH solution was prepared by dissolving 44.5 g (1.11 mol) NaOH in 339 g water, and after<br>
cooling to room temperature DMH (70.4 g, 0.549 mol) was added producing -400 mL<br>
homogeneous solution, - 1.37 M (Note that here the final halogenated DMH concentration<br>
is -0.9 M since a heel of-200 mL was used. This may in part explain the darker color of<br>
later residence times of continuous Example 18 below, while the color of the initial residence<br>
times are noticeably whiter). The DMH solution was fed at 10.0 mL/min rate while the<br>
bromine was fed at -0.40 mL/min subsurface. Chlorine was bubbled subsurface at a rate such<br>
that the pH of the reaction mixture ranged between 6 and 7 and the reaction temperature was<br>
stabilized around 53°C. When DMH feed ended, about 43.7 g bromine was consumed (<br>
0.273 mol) along with 66.6 g chlorine (-0.939 mol, i.e. added chlorine to bromine 3.4:1 or<br>
-13% excess chlorine is used). During the 37 minutes of the trifeed, a lemon yellow color<br>
atop the slurry persisted and no reddish color accumulated on the top of the slurry as was<br>
observed in Examples 14-17. After slurry filtration (36°C), washing with water (500 mL),<br>
and drying under nitrogen overnight, a very white solid (YI 6.75) was obtained (118.3 g, -90<br>
% yield). Upon standing overnight, the colorless filtrate was found to contain few floating<br>
crystals indicating that filtration should be carried out at or below room temperature. Isomer<br>
distribution of the isolated BCDMH and other analytical data are summarized in Tables 11<br>
and 12. The isomers distribution is similar to commercial samples.<br>
38<br>
EXAMPLE 17<br>
Batch Trifeed Operation at 53°C, pH~7<br>
[0101] The reagents were prepared as in Example 16. Reaction was carried out similarly<br>
except the bromine feed rate was reduced by ~ 12% to 0.35 mL/min rate in an attempt to<br>
influence the isomers distribution while conducting the reaction at a pH around 7.0 by<br>
modifying the chlorine bubbling rate. About 42.5 g bromine was consumed (0.266 mol) and<br>
53.5 g chlorine (-0.75 mol, i.e. added chlorine to bromine 2.8:1 or ~ 93% of the required<br>
chlorine) were added.<br>
[0102J During the 41 minutes of the trifeed, the reaction slurry was almost colorless with<br>
no apparent halogen coloration. After slurry filtration (30°C), washing with water (700 mL),<br>
and drying under nitrogen overnight, a white solid (YI 7.60) was obtained (105.1 g, ~ 80<br>
yield). Isomers distribution of the isolated BCDMH and other analytical data are summarized<br>
in Tables 11 and 12. Higher than expected DBDMH ratio was obtained, apparently as a result<br>
of operating above pH 6.0 and addition of less than required stoichiometric chlorine.<br>
[0103] In Table 11, the following abbreviations are used:<br>
BC refers to N,N'-bromochloro-5,5-dimethylhydantoin;<br>
DB refers to l,3-dibromo-5,5-dimethylhydantoin;<br>
DC refers to l,3-dichloro-5,5-dimethylhydantoin;<br>
MB refers to N- and/or N'- monobromo-5,5-dimethylhydantoin;<br>
MC refers to N- and/or N'- monochloro-5,5-dimethylhydantoin;<br>
YI refers to Yellowness Index;<br>
APS refers to average particle size in microns.<br>
(Table Removed) The weight of added chlorine in Examples 16 and 17 was determined by calculating<br>
the weight difference before and after the trifeed process begins. From the results shown in<br>
Table 12 it was concluded that better chlorine control and continuous monitoring of chlorine<br>
weight would enable more precise achievement of a preselected ratio of intended products<br>
in the mixture formed in the reaction. Generally speaking, the total chlorine needed for<br>
approximately -0.55 mol DMH = 0.55 mol C12 or 39.0 g in addition to enough chlorine to<br>
oxidize 0.266 mol of bromide or 18.9 g, i.e., a total of at least 57.9 g of chlorine.<br>
[0105] Examples 14-17 above were conducted as a batch operation. Example 18 hereinafter<br>
was conducted as a continuous process. Some of the main advantages of operating the<br>
continuous process are continuous removal of generated heat along with product in this<br>
exothermic bromination/ in-situ oxidation/ chlorination reaction. The benefit of co-feeding<br>
DMH/NaOH with the separate feeds of the halogens is the minimization of concentration<br>
buildup of any reagent at any given time. This allows a faster reaction rate at elevated<br>
temperatures and resulting product (e.g., BCDMH and DBDMH) precipitates out of solution<br>
almost immediately and steadily in a crystalline form. It becomes apparent that within the<br>
reactor that the reaction mixture is mostly product slurry and only very limited concentrations<br>
of halogens, DMH, or NaOH are present. Typically, only minimum amount of bromide is<br>
present and essentially no bromine. The rates of the feeds can be adjusted so that<br>
approximately stoichiometric amounts (i.e., theoretical amounts for producing BCDMH) are<br>
40<br>
present (NaOH: DMH: Br2 : C12 = 2.0: 1.0: 0.5: 1.5) and all are present in small<br>
concentrations. As will be seen, the theoretical amounts for producing BCDMH actually<br>
resulted in production of a product enriched in both BCDMH and in DBDMH.<br>
EXAMPLE 18<br>
Continuous Trifeed Operation at 53°C, pH~ 5.8-6.8<br>
[0106] In this continuous tri-feed process, six fractions (i.e., continuous operation<br>
equivalent to six batch residence times) were collected manually at a rate such that the reactor<br>
level was constant. Fractions 1 and 2 were combined. Fractions 4 and 5 were also combined.<br>
Final reactor content was labeled as fraction # 6. Each fraction (500 mL) was filtered and the<br>
original filtrates were independently analyzed. The solids were washed with tap water.<br>
Drying was carried out in filtration funnel under nitrogen or in vacuum oven at ~60°C. Solids<br>
fractions obtained were also independently analyzed by iodometric titration, proton-NMR and<br>
for particle size measurements.<br>
[0107J Into a 4-neck 1-L jacketed glass flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer (400 rpm<br>
mixing rate), a thermocouple, and a pH meter was charged 500 mL heel composed of 300 mL<br>
water and 200 mL filtrate of a previous batch run (either from Example 18 or 19). The<br>
reactor temperature was kept constant by using a circulating heating bath. DMH feed solution<br>
was prepared by dissolving 222.5 g of NaOH (5.56 mol) in 1690 g of water, and after cooling<br>
to room temperature the DMH ( 352 g, 2.74 mol) was added producing about two liters of<br>
a homogeneous solution, i.e., 1.37 M solution. (Note that the concentration of this run is<br>
similar to those of Examples 16 and 17. It is -25% more concentrated, compared to DMH<br>
feed used in Examples 14 and 15, in which ~1.1 M DMH solution was co-fed with bromine,<br>
producing white DBDMH solid).<br>
[0108] The DMH solution was fed at 10.0 mL/min rate while feeding liquid bromine at<br>
-0.39 mL/min subsurface, similar to Examples 16 and 17 above. Chlorine was bubbled also<br>
subsurface at a rate such that the pH or the reaction mixture ranged between 5.8 and 6.8 and<br>
the reaction temperature was stabilized around 53°C. When DMH feed ended, about 238.1<br>
g of bromine (1.489 mol) was consumed (or 2.97 moles of bromonium ions, assuming all<br>
bromides are oxidized to bromine) and 276.5 g of chlorine (-3.89 mol, i.e., overall, added<br>
chlorine to bromine was 2.6:1 which means about 15% less chlorine is used due to the<br>
difficulty of maintaining precise gas control at the scale of operation being used. This also<br>
explains the greater DBDMH isomer distribution ratio that was achieved. The average<br>
residence time of each fraction was -30 min. Each fraction was treated as a separate<br>
reaction mixture and was washed with an approximately equal volume water. After drying<br>
41<br>
CASESU-7152-A<br>
in a vacuum oven overnight, a total of 610 g of solid (-91 % yield based on DMH and added<br>
bromine) was collected. Analyses of all the fractions (1-6) are summarized in Tables 13 and<br>
14. Filtrates of fractions 3-6 were also examined by iodometric titration. The active halogen<br>
loss was minimal in the filtrates and indicates most of bromide was oxidized by chlorine, as<br>
