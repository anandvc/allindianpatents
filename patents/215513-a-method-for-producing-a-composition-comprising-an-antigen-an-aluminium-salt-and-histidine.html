				<td>A METHOD FOR PRODUCING A COMPOSITION COMPRISING<br>
AN ANTIGEN, AN ALUMINIUM SALT AND HISTIDINE<br>
All documents cited herein are incorporated by reference in their entirety.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention is in the field of vaccine formulation.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
As well as containing antigenic substances, vaccines contain substances such as diluents, excipients,<br>
preservatives, stabilisers and buffers. Typically, vaccines also contain adjuvants i.e. a substance<br>
which improves the immune response raised in response to the vaccine antigen.<br>
The adjuvants traditionally used in human vaccines have been aluminium salts such as aluminium<br>
hydroxide and aluminium phosphate. Many other experimental adjuvants are known and these are<br>
reviewed in, for instance, reference 1. Adsorption to aluminium salts remains, however, the most<br>
common vaccine adjuvant formulation.<br>
Although their" use is widespread, aluminium salts may not always be compatible with particular<br>
antigens. It has been suggested, for instance, that aluminium hydroxide may not be suitable for use in<br>
multivalent vaccines including hepatitis B virus surface antigen [2] or for use with the capsular<br>
polysaccharide from Haemophilus influenzae [3]. It has also been suggested that different antigens<br>
within the same vaccine formulation should be adsorbed to different aluminium salts [4] for<br>
compatibility reasons.<br>
As well as antigen compatibility, it is necessary to consider vaccine stability when using aluminium<br>
salts. For instance, their capacity for protein adsorption has been shown to drop over time at room<br>
temperature [5] and in response to autoclavjng [6]. Alum salts may also cause difficulties in freeze<br>
drying [7], Furthermore, it has been found that aluminium hydroxide can hydrolyse saccharide<br>
antigens [8], even at low temperatures and when the antigen is conjugated to a carrier protein, thus<br>
leading to reduced efficacy.<br>
In general, these issues only arise when attention moves to formulating an antigen for clinical use<br>
and may not be appreciated during initial research and development of the antigen itself.<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide improvements in the stability of vaccines which include<br>
aluminium salts and, in particular, improvements in pH stability {[buffering) and adjuvant adsorption<br>
at various temperatures and/or improvements in antigen stability (e.g. reduction in hydrolysis).<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention is based on die surprising discovery that the amino acid histidine enhances the stability<br>
of vaccines which include aluminium salt adjuvants. This has been found both for saccharide<br>
antigens and for protein antigens.<br>
The invention thus provides a composition comprising an antigen, an aluminium salt and histidine.<br>
The invention also provides a process for producing this composition, comprising the step of<br>
admixing an antigen, an aluminium salt and histidine.<br>
Histidine has previously been included in aluminium-adjuvanted vaccines. For example,<br>
reference 4 relates to a general method by which either extemporaneously prepared or<br>
liquid tfib/DTPa combination vaccines can be made in order to avoid Hib interference,<br>
whilst being able to maintain the maximum, stable adsorption of each antigen onto the<br>
aluminium-based adjuvant on which it is most immvmogenic. WO00/57906 relates to<br>
human papilloma vaccine formulations which contain virus-like particles (VLPs) which<br>
can be made more stable and have an enhanced shelf-life, by treating the VLPs to a<br>
dissasembly and reassembly process.<br>
The antigen<br>
The antigen is preferably a protein antigen or a saccharide antigen (optionally conjugated). Preferred<br>
antigens are from bacteria, with the bacterial genus Neisseria (e.g. N.meningitidis) being particularly<br>

- an antigen from Staphylococcus aureus [e.g. 46].<br>
- an antigen from Bacillus anthracis [e.g. 47,48, 49].<br>
Specific viral antigens for use with the invention include:<br>
- an antigen from hepatitis A virus, such as inactivated virus [e.g. 50,51 ].<br>
- an antigen from hepatitis B virus, such as the surface and/or core antigens [e.g. 51,52].<br>

fever virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, four serotypes of Dengue viruses, tick-borne<br>
encephalitis virus, West Nile virus.<br>
- a pestivirus antigen, such as from classical porcine fever virus, bovine viral diarrhoea virus,<br>
and/or border disease virus.<br>
- a parvovirus antigen e.g. from parvovirus B19.<br>
The composition may comprise one or more of these bacterial and viral antigens. The composition<br>
may comprise no viral antigens.<br>
Other antigens which may be used include:<br>
- a prion protein (e.g. the CJD prion protein)<br>
- an amyloid protein, such as a beta peptide [58]<br>
- a cancer antigen, such as those listed in Table 1 of ref. 59 or in tables 3 &amp; 4 of ref. 60.<br>
Where a saccharide or carbohydrate antigen is used, it is preferably conjugated to a carrier protein in<br>
order to enhance immunogehicity [e.g. refs. 61 to 70]. Preferred carrier proteins are bacterial toxins<br>
or toxoids, such as diphtheria or tetanus toxoids. The CRM197 diphtheria toxoid is particularly<br>
preferred. Other suitable carrier proteins include the N.meningitidis outer membrane protein [e.g. ref.<br>
71], synthetic peptides [e.g. 72, 73], heat shock proteins [e.g. 74], pertussis proteins [e.g. 75, 76],<br>
protein D from H.influenzae [e.g. 77], toxin A or B from Cdifficile [e.g. 78], etc Where a mixture<br>
comprises capsular saccharides from both serogroups A and C, it is preferred that the ratio (w/w) of<br>
MenA saccharide:MenC saccharide is greater than 1 (e.g. 2:1, 3:1, 4:1, 5:1, 10:1 or higher).<br>
Saccharides from different serogroups of N.meningitidis may be conjugated to the same or different<br>
carrier proteins.<br>
Any suitable conjugation reaction can be used, with any suitable linker where necessary.<br>
Toxic protein antigens may be detoxified where necessary (e.g. detoxification of pertussis toxin by<br>
chemical and/or genetic means [26]).<br>
Human papilloma virus (HPV) virus-like particles (VLPs) are not preferred antigens (cf.<br>
WO00/45841, WO00/57906, WO01/28585).<br>
Where a diphtheria antigen is included in the composition it is preferred also to include tetanus<br>
antigen and pertussis antigens. Similarly, where a tetanus antigen is included it is preferred also to<br>
include diphtheria and pertussis antigens. Similarly, where a pertussis antigen is included it is<br>
preferred also to include diphtheria and tetanus antigens. Whole cell pertussis antigen may be used.<br>
Antigen is preferably adsorbed to the aluminium salt.<br>
Where HBsAg is present, preferably it is either adsorbed to aluminium hydroxyphosphate or is not<br>
adsorbed to any salt. Adsorption of HBsAg to an aluminium hydroxide is preferably avoided.<br>
Where a H.influenzae saccharide antigen is present, preferably it is either adsorbed to aluminium<br>
hydroxyphosphate or is not adsorbed to any salt. Adsorption of Hib saccharides to an aluminium<br>
hydroxide is preferably avoided.<br>
Antigens in the composition will typically be present at a concentration of at least 1 µg/ml each. In<br>
general, the concentration of any given antigen will be sufficient to elicit an immune response against<br>
that antigen.<br>
As an alternative to using proteins antigens in the composition of the invention, nucleic acid<br>
encoding the antigen may be used [e.g. refs. 79 to 87], Protein components of the compositions of the<br>
invention may thus be replaced by nucleic acid (preferably DNA e.g. in the form of a plasmid) that<br>
encodes the protein.<br>
The aluminium salt<br>
The aluminium salt is preferably an aluminium hydroxide (e.g. aluminium oxyhydroxide) or an<br>
aluminium phosphate (e.g. aluminium hydroxyphosphate or orthophosphate), but any other suitable<br>
salt may also be used (e.g. sulphate etc. [e.g. see chapters 8 &amp;. 9 of ref. 1]). The salt may take any<br>
suitable form (e.g. gel, crystalline, amorphous etc.). Preferred salts are (amorphous)<br>
hydroxyphosphates and (crystalline) oxyhydroxide (boehmite).<br>
Hydroxyphosphates are obtained by precipitation and the reaction conditions and reactant<br>
concentrations during the precipitation reaction influence the degree of substitution of phosphate for<br>
hydroxyl in the salt. Hydroxyphosphates generally have a PO-t/ALmolar ratio between 0.3 and 0.99,<br>
and preferred salts have a ratio between 0.8 and 0.95 (e.g. 0.88+0.05). Hydroxyphosphates<br>
[Al(OH)x(PO4)y, wherein the sum of the valence of each anion times its mole fraction is -3] can be<br>
distinguished from A1PO4 by the presence of hydroxyl groups. For example, an IR spectrum band at<br>
3146cm"1 (e.g. when heated to 200°C) indicates the presence of structural hydroxyls.<br>
Aluminium oxyhydroxide [A1O(OH)] can be distinguished from AI(0H)3 by IR spectroscopy, in<br>
particular by the presence of an adsorption band at ] 070cm" and a strong shoulder at 3090-3100cm"1,<br>
Mixtures of different aluminium salts may also be used. It is preferred, however, to use essentially a<br>
single salt e.g. where two salts are used, the ratio of one to the other is at least 5:1 by weight e.g. at<br>
least 10:1,100:1,1000:1 etc.<br>
The salt will generally be present such that the concentration of Al3+ is at least lµg/ml (e.g. at least<br>
10µg/ml, at least 100µg/ml etc.).<br>
The use of histidine in combination with an aluminium phosphate (particularly a hydroxyphosphate)<br>
is particularly advantageous for acidic antigens.<br>
The histidine<br>
Histidine is a standard amino acid and is readily available for use with the invention. As it is<br>
inherently biocompatible, it is safe, and thus advantageous as an component in vaccines.<br>
The concentration of histidine in the composition will typically be at least lum and at most 1M. The<br>
concentration is preferably at least lmM (e.g. at least 2mM, 3mM, 4mM, 5mM etc.) and is preferably<br>
at most 250mM (e.g. at most 200mM, 150mM, lOOmM, 90mM, 80mM, 70mM, 60mM, 50mM,<br>
40mM, 30mM, 20mM, lOmM etc.). More preferably the concentration of histidine in the<br>
composition is between 2mM and lOmM (e.g. between 5mM and 8mM) and, most preferably, it is<br>
about 5mM.<br>
The histidine is preferably L-histidine.<br>
The histidine preferably acts as a buffer. Histidine buffers are well known to the skilled person.<br>
Accordingly, the histidine may be ionised within the composition of the invention.<br>
The composition preferably has enhanced pH stability and/or reduced antigen hydrolysis when<br>
compared to an equivalent composition in which histidine buffer system is either replaced with a<br>
sodium phosphate buffer system or in which no buffer system is included. Reduced hydrolysis may<br>
be a consequence of enhanced pH stability.<br>
Histidine may be added to the composition in the form of the amino acid itself or in the form of a<br>
salt. A typical histidine salt is the monohydrochloride monohydrate.<br>
It will be appreciated that references to histidine in the compositions of the invention refers to "free"<br>
histidine rather than to any histidine residues which may be part of a polypeptide (e.g. the antigen)<br>
within the composition.<br>
Further characteristics of the composition<br>
The composition is preferably in liquid form, but it may be lyophilised (cf. WO01/41800).<br>
The composition may also comprise a sodium salt e.g. sodium phosphate or sodium chloride. The<br>
concentration of the sodium salt is preferably at least lmM (e.g. at least 2mM, 3mM, 4mM, 5mM<br>
etc.) and is preferably at most lOmM (e.g. at most lOmM, 9mM, 8mM, 7mM etc.). More preferably<br>
the concentration of sodium salt in the composition is between lmM and 5mM (e.g. between 2mM<br>
and 3mM) and, most preferably, it is about 2.5mM.<br>
A particular advantage of the invention is that it allows good control of pH and adsorption in<br>
vaccines which contain high concentrations of free phosphate ions, which ions may be unavoidable<br>
;« th*. vardne p.p. due to exchange with phosphates in the adjuvant, or due to residual phosphate<br>
buffer. Where residual phosphate ions are present at between 3 and 5 mM, for example, pH is<br>
difficult to control between 6.0 and 7.0, and some antigens tend to desorb from adjuvants, but the<br>
addition of 5 to 10 mM histidine pH and adsorption to be controlled, including during storage at<br>
elevated temperatures.<br>
The molar ratio of histidine to free phosphate is preferably at least 1.25:1 e.g. 1.5:1,. 1.75:1, 2:1,<br>
2.25:1,2.5:1, 3:1,4:1 etc.<br>
The pH of the composition is preferably between 6 and 7 (e.g. betweem 6.3 and 7.0). The pH may be<br>
maintained by the use of a buffer. This will typically be achieved inherently by the histidine in the<br>
composition.<br>
The composition will not, in general, contain: serum (e.g. fetal calf serum etc.) or other such<br>
components used in cell culture; host cell DNA at a level of greater than 100pg/dose for antigens<br>
purified from cell culture; living cells.<br>
The composition will generally be sterile and/or pyrogen-free.<br>
The composition may comprise a detergent (e.g. a Tween, such as Tween 80) in order to minimise<br>
adsorption of antigens to containers.<br>
The composition preferably does not comprise a preservative. Where a preservative is present,<br>
mercurial preservatives (e.g. thimerosal) may be used (cf. WO98/34594). Preservatives which may<br>
be present or absent are 2-phenoxy-ethanol, methyl parabens, propyl parabens and benzyl alcohol (or<br>
mixtures thereof).<br>
Immunogenic compositions and medicaments<br>
The composition of the invention is typically a vaccine composition.<br>
The invention also provides a composition of the invention for use as a medicament. The<br>
medicament is preferably able to raise an immune response in a mammal against the antigen (i.e. it is<br>
an immunogenic composition) and is more preferably a vaccine.<br>
The invention also provides the use of a composition of the invention in the manufacture of a<br>
medicament for raising an immune response in a mammal against the antigen. The medicament is<br>
preferably a vaccine.<br>
The invention also provides a method for raising an immune response in a mamma] comprising the<br>
step of administering an effective amount of a composition of the invention. The immune response is<br>
preferably protective. The method may raise a booster response.<br>
The mammal is preferably a human, and most preferably a child.<br>
These uses and methods are preferably for the prevention and/or treatment of a disease caused by a<br>
Neisseria (e.g. meningitis, septicaemia; gonorrhoea etc.), by H.influenzae (e.g. otitis media,<br>
bronchitis, pneumonia, cellulitis, pericarditis, meningitis etc.) or by pneumococcus (e.g. meningitis,<br><br><br>
Vaccines according to the invention may either be prophylactic (i.e. to prevent infection) or<br>
therapeutic (i.e. to treat disease after infection), but will typically be prophylactic.<br>
Further components of the composition<br>
The composition of the invention will typically, in addition to the components mentioned above,<br>
comprise one or more "pharmaceutically acceptable carriers", which include any carrier that does not<br>
itself induce the production of antibodies harmful to the individual receiving the composition.<br>
Suitable carriers are typically large, slowly metabolised macromolecules such as proteins,<br>
polysaccharides, polylactic acids, polyglycolic acids, polymeric amino acids, amino acid copolymers,<br>
trehalose (WOOO/56365) and lipid aggregates (such as oil droplets or liposomes). Such carriers are<br>
well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. The vaccines may also contain diluents, such as<br>
water, saline, glycerol, etc. Additionally, auxiliary substances, such as wetting or emulsifying agents,<br>
pH buffering substances, and the like, may be present. A thorough discussion of pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable excipients is available in Remington"s Pharmaceutical Sciences [e.g. ref. 88].<br>
Immunogenic compositions used as vaccines comprise an immunologically effective amount of<br>
antigen, as well as any other of the above-mentioned components, as needed. By "immunologically<br>
effective amount", it is meant that the administration of that amount to an individual, either in a<br>
single dose or as part of a series, is effective for treatment or prevention. This amount varies<br>
depending upon the health and physical condition of the individual to be treated, age, the taxonomic<br>
group of individual to be treated (e.g. non-human primate, primate, etc.), the capacity of the<br>
individual"s immune system to synthesise antibodies, the degree of protection desired, the<br>
formulation of the vaccine, the treating doctor"s assessment of the medical situation, and other rel-<br>
evant factors. It is expected that the amount will fall in a relatively broad range that can be<br>
determined through routine trials. Dosage treatment may be a single dose schedule or a multiple dose<br>
schedule (e.g. including booster doses). The vaccine may be administered in conjunction with other<br>
immunoregulatory agents.<br>
The vaccine may be administered in conjunction with other immunoregulatory agents.<br>
The vaccine may include an adjuvant in addition to the aluminium salt. Preferred adjuvants to<br>
enhance effectiveness of the composition include, but are not limited to: (1) oil-in-water emulsion<br>
formulations (with or without other specific immunostimulating agents such as muramyl peptides<br>
(see below) or bacterial cell wall components), such as for example (a) MF59™ (WO90/14837;<br>
Chapter 10 in ref. 1), containing 5% Squalene, 0.5% Tween 80, and 0.5% Span 85 (optionally<br>
containing MTP-FE) formulated into submicron particles using a microfiuidizer, (b) SAF, containing<br>
10% Squalane, 0.4% Tween 80, 5% pluronic-blocked polymer L121, and thr-MDP either<br>
microfluidized into a submicron emulsion or vortexed to generate a larger particle size emulsion, and<br>
(c) Ribi™ adjuvant system (RAS), (Ribi Immunochem, Hamilton, MT) containing 2% Squalene,<br>
0.2% Tween 80, and one or more bacterial cell wall components from the group consisting of<br>
monophosphorylipid A (MPL), trehalose dimycolate (TDM), and cell wall skeleton (CWS),<br>
preferably MPL + CWS (Detox™): (2) saponin adjuvants, such as QS21 or Stimulon™ (Cambridge<br>
Bioscience, Worcester, MA) may be used or particles generated therefrom such as ISCOMs<br>
(immunostimulating complexes), which ISCOMS may be devoid of additional detergent e.g.<br>
WO00/0762I; (3) Complete Freund"s Adjuvant (CFA) and Incomplete Freund"s Adjuvant (ERA); (4)<br>
cytokines, such as interleukins {e.g. IL-1, BL-2, IL-4, DL-5, IL-6, IL-7, DL-12 (WO99/44636), etc.),<br>

Once formulated, the compositions of the invention can be administered directly to the subject. The<br>
subjects to be treated can be animals; in particular, human subjects can be treated. The vaccines are<br>
particularly useful for vaccinating children and teenagers.<br>
Typically, the immunogenic compositions are prepared as injectables, either as liquid solutions or<br>
suspensions; solid forms suitable for solution in, or suspension in, liquid vehicles prior to injection<br>
mav also be nreoared. The preparation also may be emulsified or encapsulated in liposomes for<br>
enhanced adjuvant effect. Direct delivery of the compositions will generally be parenteral (e.g. by<br>
injection, either subcutaneously, intraperitoneally, intravenously or intramuscularly or delivered to<br>
the interstitial space of a tissue). The compositions can also be administered into a lesion. Other<br>
modes of administration include oral and pulmonary administration, suppositories, and transdermal<br>
or transcutaneous applications (e.g. see WO98/20734), needles, and hyposprays. Dosage treatment<br>
may be a single dose schedule or a multiple dose schedule (e.g. including booster doses).<br>
The step of admixing antigen, aluminium salt and histidine<br>
To make compositions of the invention, antigen, aluminium salt and histidine must be combined. It is<br>
preferred that, when the antigen and aluminium salt are mixed, the histidine should be present.<br>
Histidine is thus present during adsorption to the aluminium salt. This compares with adding<br>
histidine to an antigen/aluminium salt combination which already exists i.e. the histidine in the<br>
process is not simply added as a buffer after antigen and aluminium salt have interacted, but instead<br>
it is present during their interaction.<br>
In the process of the invention, therefore, antigen is preferably admixed with a histidine/aluminium<br>
salt mixture. The process of the invention may therefore comprise the following steps: (a) preparing a<br>
mixture of the aluminium salt and the histidine; and (b) admixing the antigen with said mixture. The<br>
mixture of (a) is preferably aqueous and may be prepared in aqueous conditions or may be a dried<br>
mixture which is re-hydrated prior to use.<br>
Once one or more antigens has been adsorbed to an aluminium salt in the presence of histidine, the<br>
mixture may be combined with other antigens e.g. combined with existing diphtheria, tetanus,<br>
pertussis, polio or hepatitis B virus compositions.<br>

MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Example 1 -pH stability and adsorption ofmeningococcal B "287" antigen<br>
Reference 11 discloses a protein antigen named "287" from N.meningitidis serogroup B. Reference<br>
90 discloses a form of this antigen ("AG287") which is truncated to remove the Isi-terminal ammo<br>
acids up to and including its hexaglycine region. 287 and AG287 are both able to elicit a protective<br>
immune response in mice. References 16 to 19 disclose OMV antigens from N.meningitidis<br>
serogroup B. These OMVs are also able to elicit a protective immune response in mice.<br>
These two antigens were formulated by adsorption to aluminium oxyhydroxide adjuvant. Two<br>
adjuvant concentrations (1 mg/ml and 3.3 mg/ml) were tested.<br>
Immunisation studies in mice showed that vaccine immunogenicity is linked to the level of<br>
adsorption of the antigens to the adjuvant. To assess adsorption levels, samples of the final<br>
formulations were centrifuged at 1300 rpm for 10 minutes and the supernatant was analysed by SDS-<br>
PAGE in order to detect die presence of non-adsorbed antigen. The relevant protein standards at an<br>
appropriate concentration were loaded adjacent for quantitative comparison.<br>
In order to maintain a stable physiological pH at 4°C and 37°C over a period of 4 weeks using<br>
sodium phosphate buffer it was found that the composition requires lOmM sodium phosphate. At this<br>
level, however, adsorption of AG287 was only 50% (Figure 1, lane 5). 100% adsorption could be<br>
maintained at 2.5mM sodium phosphate (Lanes 5 of Figures 2 &amp; 3), but this composition does not<br>
have a stable pH at either 4°C or 37°C.<br>
It was therefore necessary to find an alternative buffer system which would maintain pH stability<br>
without decreasing adsorption.<br>
Adsorption was 95-100% using 5mM histidine (Lanes 6 of Figures 1, 2 &amp; 3) and also using lOmM<br>
histidinc (Figure 2, lane 7). In terms of adsorption, therefore, SmM or 10mM histidine was<br>
equivalent to 2.5mM sodium phosphate in the presence of either 1 mg/ml (Figures 1 &amp; 2) or<br>
3.3mg/ml (Figure 3) aluminium oxyhydroxide.<br>
In order to define the pH range in which the vaccine compositions are stable, three starting pH values<br>
were chosen (pH 6.0,6.5 and 7.0) and pH stability was monitored over four weeks in the presence of<br>
either 2.5mM sodium phosphate or 5mM histidine. Stability was monitored at both 4°C and 37°C.<br>
The antigen in all vaccines was a combination of AG287 (100µg/ml) and OMV (50µg/ml)<br>
adjuvanted with 3.3mg/ml aluminium oxyhydroxide.<br>
Figure 4 shows pH stability at 4°C and Figure 5 shows pH stability at 37°C [NB - due to bacterial<br>
contamination, no measurement of the pH 6.0 histidine-buffered vaccine was possible at 4 weeks].<br>
At both temperatures the pH tended to increase over time with 2.5mM sodium phosphate buffer but<br>
was stable in the presence of 5mM histidine buffer.<br>
In comparison with sodium phosphate buffer, therefore, the use of histidine offers pH stability over<br>
time without reducing adsorption.<br>
Example 2 - adsorption ofmeningococcal C saccharide antigen<br>
Saccharide conjugates tend to degrade by hydrolysis [7,8] when present in solution ("liquid"<br>
vaccines). Conjugates can be lyophilised to avoid this [7], but this requires adjuvant to be added at<br>
the point of reconstitution. \\ would be preferable to have a liquid form of the vaccine in which the<br>
saccharide is not subject to hydrolytic degradation.<br>
This was investigated for a conjugate of meningococcus serogroup C oligosaccharide on CRM197<br>
carrier protein [20]. CRM197 is acidic and thus does not completely adsorb to negatively charged<br>
aluminium phosphates. Histidine, however, is positively charged and it was thought that this might<br>
be able to mask the negative charge. Histidine buffer was thus tested with the aim of improving<br>
adsorption of MenC-CRM197 to aluminium hydroxyphosphate.<br>
Antigen adsorption was evaluated in the presence and absence of histidine buffer by measuring<br>
protein concentration in the vaccine supernatant using the BCA protein assay, after centrifugation to<br>
separate the adjuvant pellet. The vaccines were formulated as 20[µg/ml oligosaccharide and 45µg/ml<br>
CRM197 protein. Results were as follows:<br>
Antigen adsorption thus improves when histidine is present in the formulation: adsorption is about<br>
6% in the absence of histidine; 5mM histidine increases this to 36%; 10mM histidine increases<br>
adsorption to almost 52%.<br>
Histidine is thus a useful additive for improving the adsorption of antigens to aluminium<br>
hydroxyphosphate.<br>
Example 3 - adsorption of meningococcal B NadA antigen<br>
NadA (Neisserial adhesin A) from serogroup B N.meningitidis is disclosed as protein "961" in ref.l]<br>
(SEQ IDs 2943 &amp; 2944) and as "NMB1994" in ref.l3 (see also GenBank accession numbers<br>
11352904 &amp; 7227256). Allelic forms of NadA are disclosed in reference 91. Preferred forms of<br>
NadA lack the C-terminus anchor domain ("961c").<br>
961c (lOOug/ml) was adsorbed onto aluminium oxyhydroxide (3mg/ml) in the presence of lOmM<br>
histidine buffer, pH 6.5. After 4 weeks of storage at either 2-8°C or at 36-38°C, the antigen remained<br>
100% adsorbed (Figures 8 &amp; 9, lane 6). The pH of the composition was 6.44 at time zero and after 4<br>
weeks of storage rose very slightly to 6.48 (2-8°C) or 6.47 (36-38°C).<br>
Example 4 - adsorption of meningococcal B hybrid antigens<br>
References 92 &amp; 93 disclose hybrid expression of meningococcal B antigens. One such hybrid is<br>
"?G287nz-953" and another is "936-741". These two hybrids (100µg/ml) were each adsorbed onto<br>
aluminium oxyhydroxide (3mg/ml) in the presence of 10mM histidine buffer, pH 6.3. After 4 weeks<br>
of storage at either 2-8°C or at 36-38°C, "AG287.B-953" remained 100% adsorbed (Figures 6 &amp; 7,<br>
lane 7), with pH rising slightly from 6.44 to 6.52 (2-8°C) or 6.53 (36-38°C). "936-741" remained<br>
100% adsorbed at 36-38°C (Figure 9, lane 7) but was -99% adsorbed at 2-8°C (Figure 8, lane 7),<br>
with pH rising slightly from 6.33 to 6.37 (2-8°C) or 6.38 (36-38°C)..<br>
Example 5 - adsorption of meningococcal OMVs<br>
As mentioned above, OMV vaccines from meningococcus B are well known. OMVs were prepared<br>
from the Norwegian strain of meningococcus B or from a New Zealand strain (394/98). These two<br>
OMV preparations (50ug/rnl) were adsorbed onto aluminium oxyhydroxide (3mg/ml) in the presence<br>
of lOmM histidine buffer, pH 6.5. After 4 weeks of storage at either 2-8°C or at 36-38°C, both OMV<br>
preparations remained 100% adsorbed (Figures 8 &amp; 9, lanes 8 &amp; 9). For the Norwegian OMVs, pH<br>
rose slightly from 6.39 to 6.42 over 4 weeks at both storage temperatures. For the New Zealand<br>
OMVs, pH rose slightly from 6.40 to 6.42 (2-8°C) or 6.43 (36-38cC).<br>
New Zealand OMVs were alternatively formulated with 5mM histidine. Starting with pure water, the<br>
aluminium oxyhydroxide was added, followed by histidine, with 10 minutes mixing. The OMVs<br>
were then added and mixed for 15 minutes. NaCl was then added followed by 10 minutes further<br>
mixing. The final composition was 3.3mg/ml aluminium oxyhydroxide, 7.5mM NaCl, 5mM<br>
histidine, 100µg/ml OMV, pH 6.42.<br>
During storage at either 2-8°C or 36-36°C, pH and OMV adsorption varied as follows:<br>
A comparison of lanes 4 &amp; 5 (2-8°C) or lanes 8 &amp; 9 (36-38°C) in Figure 10 shows that OMVs remain<br>
adsorbed after 1 month of storage.<br>
Example 6-adsorption of mixtures of meningococcal OMVs and protein antigens<br>
961c, ?G287ra-953 and 936-741 were mixed at 100µg/ml of each antigen and the mixture was<br>
adsorbed onto aluminium oxyhydroxide (3mg/ml) in the presence of 10mM histidine buffer, pH 6.3.<br>
In two further formulations, OMVs were included (50µg/ml) from either Norwegian or New Zealand<br>
strain meningococcus B.<br>
All antigens in the three mixtures (Figures 6 &amp; 7, lanes 8-10) showed 100% adsorption after 4 weeks<br>
of storage at either 2-8°C or at 36-38°C, except for 936-741 which was -96% adsorbed in all three<br>
mixtures at 2-8°C and -99% adsorbed at 36-38°C. The pH of each of the three mixtures rose slightly<br>
from 6.53 at time zero to 6.62 after 4 weeks at 2-8°C. At 36-38°C, the pH of three mixtures rose to<br>
6.71±0.02.<br>
The individual antigens brought residual phosphate ions into the mixture from their own PBS.<br>
Phosphate ions were sometimes present at between 3 and 5 mM in the combined antigen mixture. In<br>
the presence of these high concentrations of residual phosphate buffer, it was difficult to stabilise pH<br>
within 6.0 to 7.0, even with 5mM histidine. When histidine was increased to 10mM, however, pH<br>
was stabilised. Furthermore, the antigens remained adsorbed even after 1 month of storage at either<br>
2-8°C or at 36-38°C.<br>
Example 7-adsorption ofmeningococcalA saccliarideantigen<br>
Reference 94 discloses CRM197 conjugates of capsular oligosaccharide from serogroup A<br>
meningococcus. The conjugates are not fully stable and are therefore prepared in lyophilised form,<br>
ready for re-constitution at the time of administration. The lyophilised form was prepared to have<br>
components which give the following composition after reconstitution into a unit dose:<br>
Example 8 - adsorption of meningococcal C, W135 and Y saccliaride antigens<br>
Reference 94 discloses CRMm conjugates of capsular oligosaccharides from meningococcus<br>
serogroups C, W135 and Y . A trivalent mixture of the three conjugates either adsorbed onto an<br>
aluminium oxyhydroxide adjuvant (2mg/ml) or an aluminium hydroxyphosphate adjuvant (0.6mg/ml<br>
Al3+) was prepared. The compositions of the two trivaJent mixtures were as follows:<br>
For the oxyhydroxide/histidine formulation, stability of the saccharide components either in the bulk<br>
mixture or after packaging into vials was as follows:<br>
Free saccharide levels are thus stable for at least 1 month at 2-8°C, before and after packaging.<br>
Under thermal stress conditions, small increases in free saccharide are seen over time for MenW135<br>
and MenY, but MenC remains stable.<br>
Over the 30 days, pH in vials and bulk was stable at 7.15+0.05 at both storage temperatures.<br>
Example 9 - adsorption of meningococcal A, C, W135 and Y saccharide antigens<br>
The two divalent liquid compositions of example 8 were diluted and 0.5ml used to reconstitute the<br>
lyophilised MenA conjugate of example 7. The resulting tetravalent mixture was administered to ten<br>
Balb/c mice (female 6-8 weeks old) per group by subcutaneous injection at day 0 and 28. The mixture<br>
contained 2pg of each saccharide conjugate per dose, which represents 1/5 of the single human dose<br>
(SHD). Controls were saline or unconjugated homologous polysaccharides. Bleedings were performed<br>
before immunization and then at day 42, with sera stored at -70°C.<br>
All the conjugates used were safe and immunogenic in the animals. GMT post-II ELISA titres (with<br>
95% confidence intervals) were as follows:<br>
Typically, therefore, titres are higher in the aluminium oxyhydroxide + histidine groups. Serum<br>
bactericidal titres were also generally better in the aluminium oxyhydroxide + histidine groups.<br>
In parallel experiments, mice were immunised as described above but the vaccine compositions<br>
contained different ratios of the various oligosaccharide conjugates. Lyophilised MenA oligo-conjugate<br>
was used in all experiments. ELISA titres were as follows:<br>
A second set of experiments was performed using a dosage of 2 pg/ml saccharide for MenA and MenC,<br>
half that dosage for MenY, and a quarter dosage for MenW135. ELJSA titres were as follows:<br>
At least for serogroups A, C and W135, therefore, the oxyhydroxide + histidine formulation<br>
generally gives better titres than hydroxyphosphate at these different antigen ratios.<br>
It will be understood that the invention has been described by way of example only and modifications<br>
may be made whilst remaining within the scope and spirit of the invention.<br>
