INTRODUCTION<br>
The present invention relates to a novel process for the preparation of l-(4-fluorophenyl)-l,3-dihydro-isobenzofuran-5-carbonitrile of the formula-I. Compound of the formula-I is a key intermediate used in the synthesis of citalopram hydrobromide of formula-II, an antidepressant drug available in the market.<br><br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Compound of the formula-I, a key intermediate in the synthesis of citalopram is disclosed in the patent DE 2,657,013 (1977). Only one process is reported for the synthesis of this compound in the above-mentioned patent. According to the process disclosed, 5-bromophthalide of the formula-Ill is reacted with p-fluorophenylmagnesium bromide to get the benzophenone derivative of the formula-IV. The benzophenone derivative of the formula-IV is reduced with lithium aluminum hydride and the resulting dihydroxy compound of the formula-V is cyclized using ortho-phosphoric acid to get the phthalane derivative of the formula-VI. The compound of the formula-VI is reacted with copper cyanide in DMF medium to get the cyano derivative of the formula-I. This process is illustrated in the Scheme<br><br><br>
Scheme-I The main drawback in this process is a Grignard reaction and the lithium aluminum hydride reduction is involved in making the compound of the formula-I. These two reactions are not easily adaptable for commercial scale due to the risk involved in handling such chemistry/ process. Also, Grignard reaction is known to be a low yielding step often associated with impurities. In this particular Grignard reaction, one major impurity (a bis- Grignard product, compound of the formula-VII) is formed along with the required product of formula-IV<br><br><br>
Scheme-II (Scheme-II). In addition, handling of lithium aluminum hydride on a commercial scale is always risky and is a very expensive reagent. As both the steps involved in making the intermediate of formula-I are very expensive the process is not an economically viable.<br>
Keeping in view of the diflficuhies in commercialization of the above-mentioned process for citalopram intermediate of the formula-I, we aimed to develop a simple and economical process for the preparation of compound of the formula-I. We observed that a promising approach for such a process is to avoid the Grignard reaction involved in making the compound of the formula-IV and avoid lithium aluminum hydride for making the compound of the formula-V.<br>
The present invention is based on our finding that an equivalent of the benzophenone derivative of the formula-IV can be prepared by a simple Friedel-Crafts benzoylation reaction. The resulting benzophenone derivative can be suitably manipulated to get the analogous dihydroxy compound of the formula-V.<br>
Accordingly, the main objective of the present invention is to provide a novel improved process for the preparation of compound of the formula I avoiding the usage of Grignard reagent and develop a Friedel-Crafts reaction to prepare an analogous benzophenone derivative of formula-V.<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to provide a novel improved process for the preparation of compound of the formula I by replacing the costly and hazardous lithium aluminum hydride used in the preparation of the compound of formula-V with simple sodium borohydride.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide a novel improved process for the preparation of compound of the formula I by avoiding / replacing the large quantity of ortho-phosphoric acid used in the preparation of compound of formula-VI to avoid the effluents problem.<br><br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide novel intermediates of the formulae X, XI, Xn, XIII, XIV, and XV defined hereinafter.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide processes for the preparation of novel intermediates of the formulae X, XI, XII, XIII, XIV, and XV defined hereinafter.<br>

Neutralization of the sodium bicarbonate layer gave 5.0gr of 2-bromo-4-chlorobenzoic acid.<br><br>
ii) Preparation of 2-cyano-4-chloro-4'-fluorobenzophenone;<br>
Into a clean and dry 500ml three-necked RB flask was charged 25gr (0.08mol) of 2-bromo-4-chloro-4'-fluorobenzophenone and l0.8gr (0.12mol) of copper (I) cyanide, and 50ml of dry pyridine. The reaction mixture was slowly heated to reflux temperature and maintained at this temperature for 7hr. TLC of the reaction mixture showed the absence of starting bromo compound. The reaction mixture was cooled to RT and poured into 500ml of water. Product was extracted into isopropyl ether and the organic layer washed with 2% HCl. Isopropyl ether was distilled off to get the crude compound. The crude product thus obtained was recrystallized from 100ml of isopropanol to get 15.6gr (75% yield) of 2-cyano-4-chloro-4'-fluorobenzophenone as off-white crystalline solid. Melting point is 114-5°C.<br>

TLC of the reaction mixture showed the absence of starting material and the reaction mixture was cooled to RT before pouring into ice-water (100ml). Product was extracted into methylene chloride and the organic layer extracted with 30ml of 10% aqueous sodium hydroxide solution. The aqueous alkali layer was treated with carbon (Igr) and filtered. The filtrate was acidified with cone, hydrochloric acid. The precipitate was filtered and dried at 60-70°C to get 15.5gr (90% yield) of off-white crystalline solid of 2-(4-fluorobenzoyl)-4-chlorobenzoic acid. Melting point is 144-146°C.<br>

The reaction mixture was heated to reflux temperature and maintained for 3hr. Excess thionyl chloride and toluene were removed from the reaction mass under vaccum and to the crude compound was added 30ml of anhydrous ethanol and stirred for 2hr at RT. Ethanol was distilled off from the reaction mixture under vaccum and the residue was recrystallized from ethyl<br><br>
acetate-hexane to get 14.0gr (85% yield) of white crystalline solid, ethyl 2-(4-fluorobenzoyl)-4-chlorobenzoate.<br>
v) Preparation of l-(4-chloro-2-hydroxymethylphenyl)-l-(4-fluorophenyl)methanol:<br>
Into a 250ml three-necked RB flask was charged lO.Ogr (0.033mol) of ethyl 2-(4-fluorobenzoyl)-4-chlorobenzoate, 50ml of t-butanol, and 2.5gr (0.07mol) of sodium borohydride. The reaction mixture was heated to reflux temperature and 10ml of methanol was added in 4 lots over a period of 8hr. After maintaining for 2hr at reflux temperature after the last lot addition, reaction was found to be complete by TLC. The reaction mixture was quenched by adding 4ml of acetic acid and the solvents distilled off under vaccum. To the residue, water (50ml) was added and the product extracted into methylene chloride (3 x 50ml). Methylene chloride layer was dried over sodium sulfate, and the solvent distilled off to get 7.8gr (90% yield) of the crude dihydroxy compound, l-(4-chloro-2-hydroxymethylphenyl)-l-(4-fluorophenyl)-methanol as syrup. This was directly used in the next step after checking its IR and 'H-NMR spectra.<br>
vi) Preparation of l-(4-fIourophenyl)-l,3-dihydro-5-chloro-isobenzofuran:<br>
Into a 250ml three-necked RB flask was charged toluene (25ml), l-(4-chloro-2-hydroxymethylphenyl)-l-(4-fluorophenyl)methanol (5.0gr, 0.02mol), and p-toluenesulfonic acid (0.63gr, 0.004mol), The reaction mixture was heated to reflux temperature under mild vaccum at 65-70°C. The reflux system was connected to Dean-Stark apparatus to remove the water formed in the reaction. After refluxing for 3hr reaction was found to be complete by TLC. The reaction mixture was cooled to RT. Water (100ml) was added to the reaction mixture and the product extracted into toluene. Toluene layer was washed with 50ml of 5.0% sodium bicarbonate solution and dried the organic layer over sodium sulfate. Toluene was removed on rotavapor at reduced temperature to get 4,0gr (85% yield) of crude l-(4-fIourophenyl)-l,3-dihydro-5-chIoro-isobenzofuran as oil.<br>
vii) Preparation of l-(4-fluorophenyl)-l,3-dihydro-isobenzofuran-5-carbonitriIe:<br>

to reflux temperature and after maintaining for 2hr, it was cooled to RT and treated with 0.4gr of zinc powder. After stirring for 30min at RT, a solution of l-(4-flourophenyl)-l,3-dihydro-5-chloro-isobenzofuran (3.0gr, 0.012mol) in 25ml of acetonitrile was added to the reaction mixture. After stirring for 30min at RT, potassium cyanide (0.44gr, 0.006mol) was added to the reaction mixture and heated the contents to reflux temperature. After maintaining for 8hr at reflux, reaction mixture was diluted with diisopropyl ether (200ml) and filtered on hi-flow bed.
