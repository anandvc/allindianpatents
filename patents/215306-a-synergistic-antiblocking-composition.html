				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a synergistic antiblocking composition comprising a first component selected from talcs along with second component selected from a group consisting of feldspar and nepheline syenites.<br>
More particularly, the invention relates to the use of a combination of talc and feldspar, nepheline and/or nepheline syenite.<br>
BACK GROUND<br>
The invention pertains in polyolefin resin compositions that are designed to produce clear films that have satisfactory antiblocking capability and where the antiblocking agent exhibits low abrasivity. These films would be used in a broad range of packaging and covering films applications.<br>
Polyolefin films are used extensively for packing around the world and, increasingly, are replacing traditional materials such as paper. High clarity polyolefin films allow easy viewing and identification of the package contents. When plastic film is produced, however, there is a tendency for two or more contacting layers of the films to stick together, or "block", making separation of the film, opening the bag, or finding the end of the roll difficult.<br>
Addition of inorganic mineral fillers to polyolefin film to reduce blocking is required commercially. It is well recognized that films produced from resin containing antiblock fillers have a rougher surface, which reduces the intimate contact between layers of film and reduces blocking, hence, the term "antiblocking agent" is applied to such fillers.<br>
Not all inorganic fillers are effective antiblocks and some effective antiblocks have other problems (such as high cost, high abrasivity, adverse affect on opticals, health hazard) which limit their commercial utility. The objective is to add as little antiblock as possible to reduce blocking force to the required level, while minimizing the adverse effects on optical properties of the film and other concerns such as wear on processing equipment.<br>
Diatomaceous earth has been widely used as a moderately effective<br><br>
antiblocking agent but has the following adverse attributes: fair film haze, poor film clarity, very high abrasiveness, and is modeiatcly expensive. Talc is also widely used in certain, polyolefin formulations as a moderately effective antiblocking agent. Its advantages over diatomaceous earth ace lower cost, excelled film clarity, aadi very low abrasiveness.   However, its film haze is usually only fair and would not be suitable for high clarity packaging applications. While nepheline syenite or felspar have been considered as antiblocking agents for high clarity film applications (because their optical index of refraction, is closer to that of polyethylene), they are relatively ineffective in reducing blocking forces, and have very high abrasiveness<br>
Abrasivity of inorganic antiblocks is of concern for Several reasons. Highly abrasive antiblocks will contribute to rapid equipment wear in compounding and processing equipment. When wear reaches the point where it chariges the equipment dimensions in critical areas, both dispersion of additives in the resfa, and output rates can be adversely affected. In such cases, product quality may surfer and production costs may increase, particularly if the equipment must be taken out of service and new parts purchased to replace worn pieces of equipment. In addition; abrasion of equipment will introduce metal contamination into the plastic product, 'which may have a detrimental effect on product stability or color or both. Antiblocks with low abrasiveness are preferred for these reasons,<br>
There have been many attempts by others to solvg the problem of balancing polyolefin film antiblocking and haze properties but nene have addressed the additional concerns of film clarity and the antiblock abrasivity and cost (which are all necessary considerations for a viable commercial product). The existing situation is that a cost effective antiblocking formulation for high clarity polyalefin films with low abrasivity of the antiblock has not yet been found.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention concerns a mixture of a first component selected from talcs and a second component selected from feldspars, nephelincs and nepheljne syenites, wherein the ratio of the first component to the second component provides an abrasiveness property significantly less than that expected from the law of mixtures. The invention further relates to m antiblock agent comprising a mixture of a first component selected from talcs and a second component selected from feldspars,<br><br>
nephelines and nepheline syenites, wherein the ratio of the first component to the second component provides an antiblocking action significantly greater than eithet component alone. This agent does not result in a significant loss of optical properties when used in a polyolefin film.<br>
This invention .also relates to a mixture of a first component selected from talcs and a second component selected from feldspars, nepheliffe and nepheline syenites, wherein title ratio of the first component to the second component provides an abrasiveness property significantly less than that expected from the law of mixtures and wherein the ratio of the first component to the second component pf provides an antiblocking action significantly greater than either component alone,<br>
This invention also relates to a polyolefin resin composition wherein the ratio of the first component to the second component further provides an antiblocking action significantly greater than either component alone, and the abfasiveness property of the first and-second component in mixture is about eighty percerit or less than that expected from the law of mixtures.<br>
Also this invention relates to a polyolefin film comprising the polyolefin resin composition, and such film can be made from the above components having an abrasiveness property significantly less than that expected from the law of mixtures, and the film can have an antiblocking action significantly greater than when made from either component alone.<br>
An advantage of the present invention is that the mixtures and polyolefin resin compositions can be used to produce films that have satisfactory antiblocking and optical properties (haziness and clarity)- The precursor mixture alfcb can have low abrasivity. The combination produces a synergistic effect wherein the degree of antiblocking action is unexpectedly higher than either alone, whil^ still retaining optical properties and having low abrasivity.<br>

The present invention is described in the following illustrative examples which are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.<br>
EXAMPLES Example 1<br>
Laboratory abrasiveness measurements of antiblock agents were conducted using an Einlehner Abrasion Tester. Mineral and combinations thereof were<br><br>
tested for abrasiveness compared to diatomaceous earth as a control.  Samples of Talc<br>
A (PolyTaic AG609), Talc B (Polybloc), nepheline syenite (Minex 75. and<br>
diatomaceous earth (Super Floss) were tested, Samples and blends are described as<br>
follows:<br>
Test 1 =        50/50* Blend of Talc A and Nepheline syenite<br>
Test 2 =        50/50   Blend of Talc B and Nepheline syenite<br>
Test 3 =         75/25   Blend of Talc A and Nepheline syenite<br>
Test 4 «        25/75   Blend of Talc A and Nepheline syenite<br>
Test 5 -         100% Talc A<br>
Test 6 -         100% Nepheline syenite<br>
Test 7 -         100% diatomaceous earth<br>
*"50/50" means 50 weight percent to 50 weight percent.<br>
All samples were tested on the Einlehner Model AT-1000 Tester as 10% dry minerals solids slurries, The wear body was a bronze wire screen. Test duration was 100 minutes and/or 174,000 abrasion cycles. The test results represents the weight loss of the wire expressed in milligrams (mgs). Results are provided in Table 1.<br>
Table 1<br>
(Table Removed)Example 2<br>
In this experiment, talc and nepheline syenite minerals, alone and in<br>
combinations, along with diatomaeeous earth as a control were compounded into LDPE (low density polyethylene) resin using a Leistritz twin screw extruded at a total loading of 50% to produce antiblock master batches. The ratio of talc to nepbeline syenite was varied from 0/100 to 100/0. The master batches were then let down (mixed) with LDPE and an erucamide slip masterbateh and blown into one millimeter thick film using a single screw blown film line so as to yield a final film formulation of 2000 ppm (parts pet million) total mineral antiblock and 750 ppm erucarnide slip agent. The film products were then tested for blocking degree and optical properties (haze and clarity) using the following procedures. Test Procedures:<br>
(1)	Blocking Degree.<br>
The parallel plate method of ASTM D3354-74 was used to measure degree of blocking, In preparing the samples, 8" x 8" pieces wer0 cut from the layflat tubing. The double film layer was separated, passed slowly over ft grounded bar to remove static charges, and then reunited so that the inside surfaced of the original bubble were in contact with each other, All films were conditioned under a top load of 1.0 psi for 24 hours using a recirculating forced air oven set a 40SC. The force required to separate these two layers was then determined and expressed as grams.<br>
(2)	Haze<br>
This test was conducted according to ASTM D 1003. Haze is the pctcentage of transmitted light which in passing through the film specimen, is scattered. The lower the haze number, the better the light-tnuismitting film optical property.<br>
(3)	Clarity<br>
A Zebedee CL-100 clarity meter was used for this test and operated in accordance with the manufacturers procedure.  Optical clarity is defined as the distinctness of detail that an object can be seen through a film. The higher the clarity number, the better the object resolution of the film.<br>
Specific antiblocking minerals used for these samples were: Talo A (PolyTalc AG609), Talc B (Polybloc), nepheline syenite (Minex 7), and diatomaeeous earth (Super Floss). Results of blocking degree, haze and clarity for the samples of Example 2 are in Table 2.<br>
