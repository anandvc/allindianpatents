				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
PROCESS FOR PURIFICATION TREATMENT OF<br>
WASTEWATER CONTAINING ORGANIC SUBSTANCE<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a process for purification treatment of<br>
wastewater containing an organic substance.<br>
Background Art<br>
There has been known a process comprising flocculating, using a<br>
flocculant, a paint component that is contained in a waste liquid produced by<br>
cleaning an aqueous paint, and separating the flocculated matter from the<br>
waste liquid by filtration through a nonwoven fabric (Patent Document 1).<br>
On the other hand, there has also been known a process for treating<br>
organic waste, comprising a hydro thermal reaction treatment step of converting<br>
organic waste into a liquid by hydrothermal reaction under subcritical<br>
water conditions or supercritical water conditions, and an air oxidation treatment<br>
step of oxidizing the liquid produced by the hydrothermal reaction<br>
treatment with air. Furthermore, there has also been known a process for<br>
recovering methane gas, comprising the hydrothermal reaction treatment<br>
step or air oxidation treatment step, and a subsequent step of fermenting<br>
methane in the presence of sludge containing an anaerobic microorganism<br>
(Patent Document 2).<br>
Patent Document 1<br>
Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2001-149948<br>
Patent Document 2<br>
Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2002-102870<br>
In the case of the process described in Patent Document 1, wastewater<br>
filtered through a nonwoven fabric can be disposed in any place, and the<br>
nonwoven fabric and the flocculated matter can be disposed as industrial<br>
waste. However, the wastewater filtered through the nonwoven fabric contains<br>
a remaining component that cannot be flocculated by a flocculant, for<br>
example, a neutralizer component (e.g., an amine, acid), a curing agent<br>
component (e.g., a melamine curing agent), an organic solvent component<br>
(e.g., an alcoholic solvent), a resin component (e.g., a tow molecular weight<br>
acrylic resin and a low molecular weight polyester resin), or another additive<br>
component. Accordingly, such wastewater cannot be disposed in rivers or<br>
the like, because the wastewater pollutes the environment, for example, if<br>
disposed there, disadvantageously.<br>
It is also possible to use a process comprising removing an organic<br>
substance that causes the environmental pollution as described above from<br>
wastewater containing the organic substance by biological treatment with<br>
bacteria. However, in such biological treatment, it is difficult to remove by<br>
separation or decompose a low molecular weight component (molecular<br>
weight: about 1,000 or less) such as an amine or a melamine curing agent.<br>
The process described in Patent Document 2 treats an organic sub-<br>
stance directly by hydrothermal reaction under supercritical conditions.<br>
Thus, the process exhibits low treatment efficiency, and poorly decomposes<br>
a low molecular weight organic substance such as a melamine curing agent,<br>
amine or organic solvent, for example, disadvantageously when treating a<br>
waste liquid containing a solid such as sludge. Furthermore, it is difficult<br>
even for the biological treatment to fully decompose and remove the low molecular<br>
weight organic substance remaining after the supercritical treatment.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a process for treating<br>
wastewater which can efficiently separate and remove a low molecular<br>
weight organic substance that cannot be separated and removed in a conventional<br>
process and which provides wastewater containing only a small<br>
amount of a toxic substance.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides the following processes for purification<br>
treatment of wastewater.<br>
(1) A process for purification treatment of wastewater containing an organic<br>
substance, which comprises subjecting the wastewater containing an<br>
organic substance to treatment complementary to supercritical treatment or<br>
subcritical treatment, and then purifying the wastewater by treatment including<br>
supercritical treatment or subcritical treatment (hereinafter may be called<br>
"process A").<br>
(2) A process for purification treatment of wastewater containing an organic<br>
substance, which comprises subjecting the wastewater containing an<br>
organic substance to treatment complementary to supercritical treatment or<br>
subcritical treatment, then treating the wastewater supercritically or subcritically,<br>
and subsequently purifying the wastewater by treatment including biological<br>
treatment (hereinafter may be called "process B").<br>
(3) A process for purification treatment of wastewater containing an organic<br>
substance, which comprises treating the wastewater containing an organic<br>
substance biologically, and then purifying the wastewater by treatment<br>
including supercritical treatment or subcritical treatment (hereinafter may be<br>
called "process C").<br>
The complementary treatment used in the present invention can be at<br>
least one physical complementary treatment selected from separation treat-<br>
ment with a flocculant, sedimentation treatment, flotation treatment and filtra-<br>
tion treatment.<br>
The complementary treatment used in the present invention can be at<br>
least one chemical treatment selected from oxidation reduction treatment,<br>
microwave treatment and treatment with an inorganic substance.<br>
The oxidation reduction treatment used in the present invention can<br>
be electrolytic treatment.<br>
In the process for purification treatment of wastewater containing an<br>
organic substance of the present invention, the supercritical treatment or<br>
subcritical treatment and the treatment with an inorganic substance can be<br>
carried out at the same time.<br>
In the process for purification treatment of wastewater containing an<br>
organic substance of the present invention, the treatment with an inorganic<br>
substance can be carried out after the supercritical treatment or subcritical<br>
treatment.<br>
In the present invention, the microwave treatment and the treatment<br>
with an inorganic substance can be carried out at the same time.<br>
In the present invention, in order to carry out the electrolytic treatment,<br>
it is possible to employ a method in which wastewater containing an organic<br>
substance is supplied to an electrolytic cell equipped with aluminum electrodes,<br>
and sodium nitrate is used as an electrolyte.<br>
In the present invention, the inorganic substance can be at least one<br>
inorganic compound selected from 12CaO • 7AI2O3, alkaline earth metal oxides<br>
and alkaline earth metal hydroxides.<br>
In the present invention, heating can be carried out in the step of<br>
treatment with an inorganic substance.<br>
In the present invention, the microwave treatment can be carried out<br>
in the presence of an inorganic substance.<br>
Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
The process A, process B and process C of the present invention can<br>
be used for various kinds of wastewater containing an organic substance. In<br>
particular, the processes are preferably used for wastewater produced in<br>
painting. Specific examples include paint booth water in various painting<br>
lines and sheet metal factories; and wastewater produced by cleaning an<br>
aqueous paint attached to paint production equipment, a painting instrument,<br>
a jig, or the like.<br>
The process A will be described in detail below.<br>
The complementary treatment used in the process A is a treatment<br>
complementary to supercritical treatment or subcritical treatment (hereinafter,<br>
such treatment is also referred to as "U treatment"). By use of the complementary<br>
treatment, the U treatment can be carried out briefly, and wastewater<br>
containing only a small amount of an organic substance can be obtained.<br>
The complementary treatment includes a physical method (Phy<br>
method) and a chemical method (Chem method). An example of the Phy<br>
method is a method of solid-liquid separation of a solid substance (sludge)<br>
contained in drainage. The solid-liquid separation treatment can reduce the<br>
amount of wastewater to be treated in the U treatment, and consequently al-<br>
lows the U treatment to be carried out briefly. On the other hand, the Chem<br>
method is a method of chemically decomposing a poorly decomposable organic<br>
substance that cannot be separated by the U method into a readily decomposable<br>
organic substance.<br>
Examples of the Phy method include separation treatment with a flocculant,<br>
sedimentation treatment, flotation treatment and filtration treatment.<br>
This treatment typically treats painting wastewater to produce, approximately,<br>
1 to 100 g/L of a precipitate, 1,000 to 8,000 mg/L of CODMn,<br>
1,000 to 8,000 mg/L of TOC, 1,000 to 8,000 mg/L of BOD and 1 to 10,000<br>
mg/L of an organic solvent. Here, CODMn refers to chemical oxygen demand,<br>
TOC refers to total organic carbon, and BOD refers to biochemical<br>
oxygen demand. Examples of the organic solvent include an aqueous ether<br>
or alcohol solvent.<br>
The above-described separation treatment with a flocculant is conventionally<br>
known treatment of adding a flocculant to wastewater containing an<br>
organic substance such as painting wastewater, and rendering insoluble and<br>
flocculating a solid of an organic substance, an inorganic substance or the<br>
like such as a pigment or a resin in the wastewater.<br>
The separation treatment with a flocculant separates and removes the<br>
sludge floated or sedimented. The separated sludge is dehydrated to be<br>
solid sludge. The remaining wastewater containing an organic substance,<br>
from which the sludge has been removed, is subjected to supercritical treatment<br>
or subcritical treatment as secondary treatment, after carrying out the<br>
Chem method if necessary.<br>
A conventionally known inorganic salt or polymer flocculant can be<br>
used as the flocculant. Examples of the inorganic salt include PAC (polya-<br>
luminum chloride), aluminum sulfate (sulfuric acid band), sodium aluminum<br>
oxide, polyaluminum chloride, ferric chloride, ferrous sulfate and ferric sulfate.<br>
Examples of the polymer flocculant include polyacrylate, polyacrylamide,<br>
sodium polyacrylate, modified polyacrylamide, polymethacrylate, polyamide,<br>
polyamine, an amino condensate, a maleic acid copolymer, quaternary<br>
ammonium salt, polyvinylpyridine, polyoxyethylene, sodium alginate, a<br>
water-soluble aniline resin, polythiourea and polyethyleneimine. These flocculants<br>
can be used singly or in a combination of two or more according to<br>
the type of wastewater.<br>
The sedimentation treatment described above is a separation method<br>
making use of the difference in density between water and organic and/or<br>
inorganic suspended matters or solid particles in wastewater. Examples include<br>
sedimentation treatment by gravity and centrifugation treatment. In<br>
particular, in the centrifugation treatment, since a solid such as a suspended<br>
matter or solid particles has a density larger than that of water, solid-liquid<br>
separation is carried out briefly by a large centrifugal force. The centrifugation<br>
can be carried out in a conventionally known centrifuge such as, for example,<br>
a continuous horizontal centrifuge or a batch vertical centrifuge. The<br>
remaining wastewater containing an organic substance, from which the<br>
sludge has been removed, is subjected to supercritical treatment or subcritical<br>
treatment, after carrying out the Chem method if necessary.<br>
The flotation treatment described above is separation treatment of introducing<br>
microbubbles into wastewater and attaching the microbubbles to<br>
organic and/or inorganic suspended matters or solid particles to reduce the<br>
apparent gravity of the particles and float the particles on the wastewater<br>
surface. The flotation treatment can be carried out in conventionally known<br>
flotation equipment such as, for example, whole pressure flotation equipment,<br>
partial pressure flotation equipment, circulating pressure flotation<br>
equipment or atmospheric pressure flotation equipment.<br>
The remaining wastewater containing an organic substance, from<br>
which the sludge has been removed, is subjected to supercritical treatment<br>
or subcritical treatment, after carrying out the Chem method if necessary.<br>
The filtration treatment described above can be carried out using, for<br>
example, a screen, fabric, filter or sieve under atmospheric pressure or under<br>
pressure. The treatment can be carried out singly or in a combination of<br>
two or more.<br>
Examples of the Chem method include oxidation reduction treatment,<br>
microwave treatment and decomposition treatment with an inorganic substance.<br>
The treatment can be carried out singly or in a combination of two or<br>
more. In particular, a combination of microwave treatment with decomposition<br>
treatment with an inorganic substance is preferably used. Any of these<br>
treatments can be repeated if necessary. Examples of a combination of two<br>
or more treatments to be repeated include a method comprising microwave<br>
treatment in the presence of 12CaO • 7AI2O3, subsequent microwave treatment<br>
in the presence of an alkaline earth metal oxide, and repeated microwave<br>
treatment in the presence of 12CaO • 7AI2O3 and/or microwave treatment<br>
in the presence of an alkaline earth metal oxide.<br>
The oxidation reduction treatment oxidizes or reduces an organic<br>
substance in wastewater to cause a chemical change in the organic substance,<br>
and thereby helps decompose the substance efficiently by supercritical<br>
treatment or subcritical treatment. Examples of the oxidation reduction<br>
treatment include treatment by an oxidizing agent (e.g., H2O2, K2Cr2O7,<br>
KMnO4, O3, 02, NaOCI or a halogen element) or a reducing agent (e.g., H2,<br>
SO2, H2S, Na2SO3 or FeSO4) and electrolytic treatment described below.<br>
The electrolytic treatment is a method comprising placing electrodes<br>
in wastewater containing an organic substance such as painting wastewater<br>
and applying direct current to the wastewater to carry out electrolytic reaction.<br>
In this treatment, electrons are incorporated in the cathode to cause<br>
oxidation reaction, and electrons are emitted from the anode to cause reduction<br>
reaction.<br>
The electrolytic treatment can also carry out adsorption of a solid of<br>
an organic substance, an inorganic substance or the like such as a pigment<br>
or a resin in wastewater on microbubbles of oxygen and hydrogen produced<br>
by electrolysis of the water to recover the substance on the wastewater surface<br>
by buoyancy of the bubbles, in addition to the above-described oxidation<br>
reduction reaction.<br>
The electrolytic treatment separates and removes the sludge floated<br>
or sedimented. The separated sludge is dehydrated to be solid sludge. The<br>
remaining wastewater containing an organic substance, from which the<br>
sludge has been removed, is subjected to supercritical treatment or subcriti-<br>
cal treatment as secondary treatment.<br>
The electrolytic treatment is typically carried out by placing and dissolving<br>
an electrolyte in wastewater supplied. A treatment vessel used in<br>
this case has a plurality of electrodes placed at appropriate intervals. The<br>
electrolysis can be carried out by applying current to a space between the<br>
electrodes. Aluminum electrodes can be used as the electrodes, and sodium<br>
nitrate, sodium chloride or the like is suitably used as the electrolyte.<br>
In the above-described electrolytic treatment, the electrolyte concen-<br>
tration (for example, sodium nitrate concentration) is about 0.01 to 0.05<br>
moi/L based on 20,000 mg/L of the solid concentration.<br>
The microwave treatment described above is treatment of irradiating<br>
an organic substance in wastewater with microwaves to cause a chemical<br>
change in the organic substance. By this treatment, the organic substance is<br>
decomposed itself or is made readily decomposed by supercritical treatment<br>
or subcritical treatment.<br>
A microwave is an electromagnetic wave having a wavelength of<br>
about 0.1 to 1,000 mm. Examples include UHF (decimetric wave), SHF<br>
(centimetric wave), EHF (millimetric wave) and submillimetric wave. 2,450<br>
MHz internationally allocated for industrial use is often used, but the microwave<br>
is not limited thereto.<br>
The microwave treatment can be carried out using a microwave generator<br>
used in a microwave oven or the like.<br>
The microwave irradiation time can be appropriately selected according<br>
to the concentration of the organic substance in wastewater, the intensity<br>
of irradiation light, or the like, but is typically preferably 1 to 60 minutes approximately.<br>
Wastewater is heated by irradiation with microwaves. However, it is<br>
not particularly necessary to cool down the wastewater if an operational risk<br>
such as boiling of the wastewater or volatilization of the organic solvent does<br>
not occur. This is because the organic substance is decomposed faster as<br>
the temperature increases, generally. The temperature of wastewater is<br>
preferably as high as possible.<br>
The microwave treatment can be carried out, for example, using a<br>
solid catalyst with oxygen-containing gas supplied. The microwave treat-<br>
ment oxidizes and decomposes an organic substance.<br>
As the solid catalyst, a conventionally known solid catalyst can be<br>
used without specific limitations. Examples of the solid catalyst that can be<br>
used include an insoluble or poorly soluble compound of a metal element se-<br>
lected from titanium, silicon, zirconium, manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel,<br>
tungsten, cerium, copper, silver, gold, platinum, palladium, rhodium, ruthe-<br>
nium, iridium and the like; and an inorganic carrier (particles of an inorganic<br>
acid, activated carbon, zeolite or the like) with such a metal carried.<br>
The decomposition treatment with an inorganic substance causes a<br>
chemical change in an organic substance in wastewater using an inorganic<br>
compound such as 12CaO • 7AI2O3, an alkaline earth metal oxide or an alka-<br>
line earth metal hydroxide. By this treatment, the organic substance is de-<br>
composed itself or is made readily decomposed by supercritical treatment or<br>
subcritical treatment. The decomposition treatment with an inorganic sub-<br>
stance and the U treatment can be carried out at the same time.<br>
The above-described 12CaO • 7Al2O3 is crystals of 12CaO • 7AI2O3<br>
called C12A7, and is typically obtained by heating and calcining a mixture of<br>
calcium carbonate with aluminum oxide at 1,200°C to 1,400°C. The calcin-<br>
ing reaction may be carried out in a normal atmosphere, but is preferably<br>
carried out in a pure oxygen atmosphere in order to decompose an organic<br>
substance effectively. As the 12CaO • 7AI2O3, a 12CaO • 7AI2O3 compound<br>
disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2002-3218 which includes acti-<br>
vated oxygen at a high concentration can be used.<br>
The decomposition treatment of wastewater containing an organic<br>
substance using the above 12CaO • 7AI2O3 is carried out by adding the<br>
12CaO • 7AI2O3 to the wastewater and stirring the mixture while heating if<br>
necessary- After completion of the treatment, 12CaO • 7AI2O3 can be recovered<br>
by filtration (or precipitation) and reused.<br>
The amount of 12CaO • 7AI2O3 added is appropriately selected according<br>
to the type or concentration of the organic substance contained in<br>
wastewater, and is typically about 0.1 to 40 wt%, and preferably about 0.5 to<br>
15 wt% based on the wastewater. If the amount is less than 0.1 wt%, it is<br>
difficult to sufficiently decompose the organic substance. On the other hand,<br>
if more than 40 wt%, it is difficult to sufficiently stir the wastewater in a treatment<br>
vessel, and the treatment involves a high cost, undesirably.<br>
In the above treatment, the inorganic substance can decompose an<br>
organic substance more efficiently by heating. As heating means, microwave<br>
irradiation is particularly suitable.<br>
The above-described alkaline earth metal oxide and/or hydroxide is<br>
preferably insoluble in water. As an alkaline earth metal, calcium is particularly<br>
suitable in terms of cost as well as efficiency in decomposition of an organic<br>
substance. The alkali earth metal oxide is reacted with water to yield a<br>
hydroxide. In this case, they are exothermically and intensely reacted with<br>
each other. Thus, the alkaline earth metal hydroxide is more preferable in<br>
terms of handleability and stability. As the alkaline earth metal oxide and/or<br>
hydroxide, a composite metal oxide and/or hydroxide containing an alkaline<br>
earth metal may be used.<br>
The decomposition treatment of wastewater containing an organic<br>
substance with the above alkali earth metal oxide and/or hydroxide is carried<br>
out by adding the alkali earth metal oxide and/or hydroxide to the wastewater<br>
and stirring the mixture while heating if necessary. After completion of the<br>
treatment, the alkali earth metal oxide and/or hydroxide can be recovered by<br>
filtration and reused.<br>
The amount of the alkali earth metal oxide and/or hydroxide added is<br>
appropriately selected according to the type or concentration of the organic<br>
substance contained in wastewater, and is typically about 0.1 to 50 wt%, and<br>
preferably about 1 to 20 wt% based on the wastewater. If the amount is less<br>
than 0.1 wt%, it is difficult to sufficiently decompose the organic substance.<br>
On the other hand, if more than 50 wt%, it is difficult to sufficiently stir the<br>
wastewater in a treatment vessel, and the treatment involves a high cost,<br>
undesirably.<br>
In the above treatment, an organic substance can be decomposed<br>
more efficiently by heating. As heating means, microwave irradiation is particularly<br>
suitable.<br>
As the complementary treatment in the process A of the present invention,<br>
the above-described Phy method or Chem method can be carried<br>
out alone, or the Phy method can be carried out in combination with the<br>
Chem method to be subsequently carried out. When these methods are carried<br>
out in combination, it is preferable to cany out the Chem method after<br>
removing the solid by the Phy method if wastewater contains the solid at a<br>
particularly high concentration.<br>
The U treatment in the process A of the present invention is treatment<br>
of oxidizing, using supercritical water or subcritical water, a waste liquid containing<br>
an organic substance that can be made readily decomposed by oxidation<br>
due to the complementary treatment so as to decompose the organic<br>
substance.<br>
Supercritical water refers to water under supercritical conditions, specifically,<br>
water at a temperature higher than a critical temperature of 374.1°C<br>
and at a pressure higher than a critical pressure of 22.12 MPa. Subcritical<br>
water refers to water that exhibits the same effects as in supercritical water,<br>
and typically has a temperature in Kelvin 0.65 time or more the critical temperature<br>
and a pressure 0.65 time or more the critical pressure. The water in<br>
such a state cannot be liquefied even if pressure is applied further. Supercritical<br>
water or subcritical water cannot be called a gas or a liquid in terms of<br>
physical properties, and has characteristics between a gas and a liquid. Supercritical<br>
water or subcritical water exists as a single phase without a gasliquid<br>
boundary. Specifically, supercritical water or subcritical water as a single<br>
phase is mixed with oxygen or the like at any ratio, and is thus particularly<br>
useful as a reaction solvent in the oxidation decomposition of an organic<br>
substance.<br>
In the oxidation treatment with supercritical water or subcritical water,<br>
a conventionally known oxidizing agent (e.g., H2O2, K2Cr2O7, KMnO4, O3, O2,<br>
NaOCI or a halogen element) may exist if necessary. The ratio thereof is<br>
typically 0.5 to 50 parts by weight, and preferably 1 to 20 parts by weight<br>
based on 100 parts by weight of wastewater.<br>
The supercritical treatment or subcritical treatment may also be carried<br>
out while blowing oxygen or air to wastewater.<br>
The conditions of the supercritical treatment or subcritical treatment<br>
are not limited insofar as the conditions meet the above-described critical<br>
conditions. Typically, the reaction temperature is 300 to 800°C, and preferably<br>
400 to 600°C, the pressure is 88 to 300 atm (8.9 to 30.4 MPa), and preferably<br>
100 to 170 atm (10.1 to 17.2 MPa), and the reaction time is 30 sec-<br>
onds to 180 minutes, and preferably 5 to 90 minutes.<br>
In the supercritical treatment or subcritical treatment, almost all or-<br>
ganic substances are converted into a gaseous product (e.g., CO, H2, CH4 or<br>
CO2) and a volatile substance such as an alcohol, aldehyde or furan by hydrolysis<br>
reaction or thermal decomposition reaction. An organic substance is<br>
decomposed into water and hydrocarbon gas in several seconds to several<br>
minutes in the presence of oxygen. The organic substance can be separated<br>
as a salt from wastewater containing a hetero atom by addition of a<br>
basic substance. Wastewater containing 2% or more of a carbon component<br>
can be heated to 550°C or more due to its inherent oxidation heat, and this is<br>
energetically advantageous as compared with the combustion method.<br>
In order to carry out the supercritical treatment or subcritical treatment,<br>
an inorganic substance used in the above treatment with an inorganic<br>
substance is added to wastewater, and then the mixture is allowed to be in a<br>
supercritical state or a subcritical state. Thus, the treatment with an inorganic<br>
substance and the supercritical treatment or subcritical treatment can<br>
be carried out at the same time.<br>
The U treatment can treat painting wastewater to produce less than<br>
1,000 mg/L, and preferably less than 500 mg/L of CODMn, less than 1,000<br>
mg/L, and preferably less than 500 mg/L of TOC, less than 1,000 mg/L, and<br>
preferably less than 500 mg/L of BOD, and less than 1 mg/L, and preferably<br>
less than 0.5 mg/L of an organic solvent.<br>
If purified to attain the above level, the wastewater is discharged as is.<br>
If not, the treated water after the above U treatment is preferably purified by<br>
the complementary treatment or U treatment again as return water to attain<br>
the above level.<br>
In the process A of the present invention, the above treatment with an<br>
inorganic substance can be carried out after the U treatment, if necessary.<br>
The complementary treatment carried out in the process A of the present<br>
invention is treatment complementary to the supercritical treatment or<br>
subcritical treatment. Use of this complementary treatment allows the U<br>
treatment to be carried out briefly, and can provide wastewater containing<br>
only a small amount of an organic substance.<br>
The supercritical water or subcritical water treatment can convert almost<br>
all organic substances into a gaseous product and a volatile substance<br>
by hydrolysis reaction or thermal decomposition reaction, and can decompose<br>
an organic substance into water and volatile gas briefly in the presence<br>
of oxygen.<br>
Furthermore, in the treatment with 12CaO • 7AI2O3 as an inorganic<br>
substance, the inorganic substance is heated to act as a catalyst for decomposing<br>
an organic substance, and, in particular, the inorganic substance itself<br>
generates oxygen radicals to promote decomposition of an organic substance<br>
when heated in the presence of oxygen. Use of microwave heating<br>
means allows heating to be carried out briefly, and is effective for generating<br>
oxygen radicals.<br>
In addition, the treatment with an alkaline earth metal as an inorganic<br>
substance is effective in that, for example, the hydroxyl ion possessed by the<br>
inorganic substance promotes hydrolysis of the alkyi ether bond in alkyl eth-<br>
erified melamine as a water-soluble curing agent that is contained in wastewater<br>
produced from a melamine-curable paint now conventionally used as a<br>
thermosetting paint.<br>
The process B of the present invention is a process for purification<br>
treatment of wastewater containing an organic substance, which comprises<br>
subjecting the wastewater containing an organic substance to treatment<br>
complementary to supercritical treatment or subcritical treatment, then treating<br>
the wastewater supercritically or subcritically, and subsequently purifying<br>
the wastewater by treatment including biological treatment.<br>
In the process B, treatment complementary to the U treatment is preferably<br>
carried out prior to the U treatment.<br>
The complementary treatment can be at least one treatment selected<br>
from separation treatment with a flocculant, sedimentation treatment, flotation<br>
treatment and filtration treatment.<br>
The complementary treatment can be at least one treatment selected<br>
from oxidation reduction treatment, microwave treatment and treatment with<br>
an inorganic substance.<br>
The oxidation reduction treatment can be electrolytic treatment.<br>
In the process B of the present invention, the supercritical treatment<br>
or subcritical treatment and the treatment with an inorganic substance can<br>
be carried out at the same time.<br>
In the process B of the present invention, the treatment with an inorganic<br>
substance can be carried out between the supercritical treatment or<br>
subcritical treatment and the biological treatment.<br>
In the process B of the present invention, the microwave treatment<br>
and the treatment with an inorganic substance can be carried out at the<br>
same time.<br>
In order to carry out the electrolytic treatment, it is possible to employ<br>
a method in which wastewater containing an organic substance is supplied<br>
to an electrolytic cell equipped with aluminum electrodes, and sodium nitrate<br>
is used as an electrolyte.<br>
The inorganic substance can be at least one inorganic compound se-<br>
lected from 12CaO • 7AI2O3, alkaline earth metal oxides and alkaline earth<br>
metal hydroxides.<br>
Heating can be carried out in the step of treatment with an inorganic<br>
substance.<br>
The microwave treatment can be carried out in the presence of an inorganic<br>
substance.<br>
The complementary treatment used in the process B is carried out in<br>
the same method and under the same conditions as in the complementary<br>
treatment described for the process A. See the description regarding the<br>
complementary treatment described for the process A for details.<br>
The U treatment in the process B is treatment of oxidizing, using supercritical<br>
water or subcritical water, a waste liquid containing an organic<br>
substance that can be made readily decomposed by oxidation due to the<br>
complementary treatment so as to decompose the organic substance contained<br>
in the waste liquid.<br>
The U treatment can be carried out in the same manner as in the U<br>
treatment in the process A. See the description regarding the U treatment<br>
described for the process A for details.<br>
In the process B of the present invention, the biological treatment is<br>
carried out after the U treatment.<br>
In the biological treatment, an organic or inorganic carrier carries a<br>
microorganism, and the microorganism decomposes an organic substance in<br>
wastewater. The treatment is more efficient than the activated sludge<br>
method. Examples of the material for the organic carrier include, but are not<br>
limited to, a photocurable resin, polyurethane, polyvinyl alcohol, polyethylene,<br>
polyacrylamide, polyester, polypropylene, agar, alginic acid, cara-<br>
geenan, cellulose, dextran, agarose and an ion exchange resin. These materials<br>
may also be used in combination with an inorganic substance.<br>
The microorganism used for the biological treatment may be appropriately<br>
selected from conventionally known aerobic bacteria and anaerobic<br>
bacteria. Examples of the aerobic bacteria include Pseudomonas bacteria<br>
and Acetobacter bacteria. Examples of the anaerobic bacteria include<br>
methane bacteria and Clostridium bacteria. The above biological treatment<br>
can be carried out at a treatment temperature of 10 to 40°C, at pH 6.0 to 9.0,<br>
and for a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 24 to 48 hours, for example.<br>
The complementary treatment carried out in the process B of the present<br>
invention is treatment chemically or physically complementary to the<br>
supercritical treatment or subcritical treatment. This complementary treatment<br>
allows the treatment to be carried out briefly, and can provide wastewater<br>
containing only a small amount of an organic substance. In addition, the<br>
complementary treatment can directly decompose an organic substance<br>
contained in wastewater, and can preliminarily decompose a poorly decomposable<br>
organic substance that cannot be decomposed in the U treatment<br>
into a readily decomposable organic substance.<br>
Supercritical water or subcritical water exists as a single phase of supercritical<br>
water or subcritical water without a boundary between water as a<br>
liquid and oxygen as a gas, and is thus particularly useful as a reaction solvent<br>
for oxidation decomposition of an organic substance.<br>
The supercritical treatment or subcritical treatment can convert almost<br>
all organic substances into a gaseous product and a volatile substance by<br>
hydrolysis reaction or thermal decomposition reaction, and can decompose<br>
an organic substance into water and volatile gas briefly by mixing the organic<br>
substance with oxygen.<br>
Furthermore, in the treatment with 12CaO • 7AI2O3 as an inorganic<br>
substance, the inorganic substance is heated to act as a catalyst for decomposing<br>
an organic substance, and, in particular, the inorganic substance itself<br>
generates oxygen radicals to promote decomposition of an organic substance<br>
when heated in the presence of oxygen. Use of microwave heating<br>
means allows heating to be carried out briefly, and promotes generation of<br>
oxygen radicals.<br>
In addition, the treatment with an alkaline earth metal as an inorganic<br>
substance is effective in that, for example, the hydroxyl ion possessed by the<br>
inorganic substance promotes hydrolysis of the alkyl ether bond in an alkyl<br>
etherified melamine curing agent as a water-soluble curing agent that is contained<br>
in wastewater produced from a melamine-curable paint now conventionally<br>
used as a thermosetting paint.<br>
The process B of the present invention, in which the biological treatment<br>
is combined with the supercritical treatment or subcritical treatment,<br>
can particularly decompose an organic substance that cannot be oxidized<br>
and decomposed by the supercritical treatment or subcritical treatment.<br>
The process C of the present invention is a process for purification<br>
treatment of wastewater containing an organic substance, which comprises<br>
treating the wastewater containing an organic substance biologically, and<br>
then purifying the wastewater by treatment including supercritical treatment<br>
or subcritical treatment.<br>
The process C will be described in detail below.<br>
In the process C of the present invention, solid-liquid separation<br>
treatment can be carried out prior to the biological treatment. The solid-liquid<br>
separation treatment can be at least one treatment selected from separation<br>
treatment with a flocculant, sedimentation treatment, flotation treatment and<br>
filtration treatment.<br>
In the process C, intermediate treatment for promoting decomposition<br>
in the biological treatment and/or the supercritical treatment or subcritical<br>
treatment can be carried out between the solid-liquid separation treatment<br>
and the biological treatment.<br>
The intermediate treatment can be at least one treatment selected<br>
from oxidation reduction treatment, microwave treatment and treatment with<br>
an inorganic substance.<br>
The oxidation reduction treatment can be electrolytic treatment.<br>
In the process C of the present invention, the treatment with an inorganic<br>
substance can be carried out between the biological treatment and the<br>
supercritical treatment or subcritical treatment.<br>
In the process C of the present invention, in order to carry out the<br>
electrolytic treatment, it is possible to employ a method in which wastewater<br>
containing an organic substance is supplied to an electrolytic cell equipped<br>
with aluminum electrodes, and sodium nitrate is used as an electrolyte.<br>
The inorganic substance can be at least one inorganic compound selected<br>
from 12CaO • 7AI2O3, alkaline earth metal oxides and alkaline earth<br>
metal hydroxides.<br>
The treatment with an inorganic substance can be carried out while<br>
heating.<br>
The heating can be carried out by the microwave treatment.<br>
The biological treatment used in the process C of the present invention<br>
can be carried out in the same manner as in the biological treatment de-<br>
scribed for the process B. See the description regarding the biological<br>
treatment described for the process B for details.<br>
The supercritical treatment or subcritical treatment used in the proc-<br>
ess C of the present invention can be carried out in the same manner as in<br>
the method described for the process A. See the description described for<br>
the process A for details.<br>
In the present invention, prior to the biological treatment, treatment<br>
complementary to purification treatment by the biological treatment (primary<br>
treatment) or the supercritical treatment or subcritical treatment (secondary<br>
treatment) can be carried out. This treatment allows the U treatment to be<br>
carried out briefly, and can provide wastewater containing only a small<br>
amount of an organic substance. Such complementary treatment includes a<br>
physical method (Phy method) and a chemical method (Chem method).<br>
Such complementary treatment can be carried out in the same manner as in<br>
the complementary treatment (Phy treatment or Chem treatment) used in the<br>
process A. See the description regarding the complementary treatment described<br>
for the process A for details.<br>
Examples of the Phy treatment include separation treatment with a<br>
flocculant, sedimentation treatment, flotation treatment and filtration treatment.<br>
These pretreatments can be carried out in the same manner as in the<br>
Phy method described for the process A. See the description regarding the<br>
Phy method for details.<br>
The remaining wastewater containing an organic substance, from<br>
which the sludge has been removed by the Phy treatment, is subjected to<br>
the biological treatment as primary treatment, after carrying out the Chem<br>
treatment if necessary.<br>
The filtration treatment used in the Phy treatment can be carried out<br>
using, for example, a screen, fabric, filter or sieve under atmospheric pressure<br>
or under pressure. The treatment can be carried out singly or in a combination<br>
of two or more.<br>
The Chem treatment can be carried out in the same manner as in the<br>
Chem method described for the process A. See the description regarding<br>
the Chem method for details.<br>
The Phy treatment or Chem treatment can be carried out alone in the<br>
process C of the present invention. Alternatively, the Phy treatment and the<br>
subsequent Chem treatment can be carried out in combination. When the<br>
treatments are carried out in combination, if wastewater contains a solid at a<br>
particularly high concentration, the Chem treatment is preferably carried out<br>
after removing the solid by the Phy treatment.<br>
The treatment with an inorganic substance may be carried out between<br>
the biological treatment and the supercritical treatment or subcritical<br>
treatment.<br>
The treatment with an inorganic substance is carried out by adding an<br>
inorganic substance to wastewater and then allowing the mixture to be in a<br>
supercritical state or a subcritical state. Thus, the treatment with an inorganic<br>
substance and the supercritical treatment or subcritical treatment can<br>
be carried out at the same time.<br>
In the process C, the supercritical treatment or subcritical treatment<br>
can treat painting wastewater to produce less than 1,000 mg/L, and preferably<br>
less than 500 mg/L of CODMn, less than 1,000 mg/L, and preferably less<br>
than 500 mg/L of TOC, less than 1,000 mg/L, and preferably less than 500<br>
mg/L of BOD, and less than 1 mg/L, and preferably less than 0.5 mg/L of an<br>
organic solvent.<br>
If purified to attain the above level, the wastewater is discharged as is.<br>
If not, the treated water after the above U treatment is preferably purified by<br>
the Chem treatment or biological treatment again as return water to attain<br>
the above level.<br>
The Phy treatment or Chem treatment carried out as the complementary<br>
treatment in the process C of the present invention is treatment chemically<br>
or physically complementary to the biological treatment or the supercritical<br>
treatment or subcritical treatment. Use of the complementary treatment<br>
allows the U treatment to be carried out briefly, and can provide<br>
wastewater containing only a small amount of an organic substance.<br>
Examples<br>

examples.<br>
Example 1<br>
A dilution of an aqueous paint for automobiles (polyester/melamine<br>
curable type, solid concentration: 22.3 wt%) in water having a solid concentration<br>
of 2 wt% was used as a painting wastewater sample (A). In the sample<br>
(A) at the initial stage, CODMn was 8,500 mg/L, TOC was 11,000 mg/L,<br>
and the amount of the melamine curing agent was 3.49 x 103 mVsec. The<br>

by multiplying the detection potential by the detection time, which indicates<br>
the melamine curing agent in high performance liquid chromatography<br>
(HPLC) (hereinafter the same).<br>
A sodium nitrate solution at a concentration of 0.02 mol/L was added<br>
to 280 g of the painting wastewater sample (A). The mixed solution was<br>

for a hydraulic retention time of 48 hours. Then, the biologically treated wa-<br>
ter was filtered. Next, 5 parts by weight of H2O2 was added to 100 parts by<br>
weight of the filtrate, and the mixture was treated in supercritical water at<br>
500°C and 25 MPa for 30 minutes. CODMn, TOC, and the amount of the<br>
melamine curing agent are shown in Table 3.<br>
Example 11<br>
12CaO • 7AI2O3 having an amount corresponding to 10 wt% of the<br>
treated liquid (B) obtained in Example 10 (12CaO • 7AI2O3 obtained by calcination<br>
in a pure oxygen atmosphere at 1,250°C for three hours) was added<br>
to the treated liquid (B), and the mixture was stirred and then irradiated with<br>
microwaves (frequency: 2.45 GHz, output: 500W) for 10 minutes. CODMn,<br>
TOC, and the amount of the melamine curing agent in the treated liquid (C)<br>
after the treatment with 12CaO • 7Al2O3 are shown in Table 3.<br>

Rhodococcus, Bacillus, Candida and Fusarium aerobic bacteria at a treat-<br>
ment temperature of 20 to 25°C, at pH 7 to 8.5 and for a hydraulic retention<br>
time of 48 hours. Then, the biologically treated water was filtered.<br>
Next, 5 parts by weight of H2O2 converted to 100 wt% was added to<br>
100 parts by weight of the resulting treated water, and the mixture was<br>
treated in supercritical water at 500°C and 25 MPa for 30 minutes. CODMn,<br>
TOC, and the amount of the melamine curing agent are shown in Table 3.<br>
Example 12<br>
