				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to the field of network communication technologies, and<br>
particularly to a method for accessing integrated services by an access network.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Network providers have always been pursuing the implementation methods of<br>
carrying services of voice, video, data, private line, etc., over the same network at the same<br>
time so as to increase the utilization of network and reduce the costs of investment and<br>
operation.<br>
An IP (Internet Protocol) network has the advantages of high efficiency of bandwidth<br>
utilization, low price, and high bandwidth, and is open and easy for providing flexible<br>
services. With the mass deployment of broadband access network, the IP network gradually<br>
becomes the practical platform for carrying integrated services. Providers wish to access<br>
voice, video and enterprise private line and the like, besides the originally carried data<br>
services, via the broadband access nodes. In addition to IP-based voice and enterprise<br>
private line which are newly deployed on the broadband network, some providers also wish<br>
to carry the traditional services, such as voice or private lines based on TDM (Time Division<br>
Multiplexing), ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode), or FR (Frame Relay), via the<br>
broadband access network.<br>
The existing IP network is mainly designed and constructed for the transmission of<br>
data services. The IP network is connectionless and can meet the requirement of the<br>
transmission of data services which need only reachability, but can not meet the<br>
requirements of reliable transmission (packet loss ratio), time characteristics(order, delay<br>
and delay variation) Dsecurity(isolation between various services, privacy of private network<br>
services) and survivability(the recovery time of backup link after failure) for transmission of<br>
voice, video and private line interconnection services.<br>
In order to meet the requirement of QoS (quality of service) required by the<br>
transmission of voice, video and private line interconnection services, it is necessary for a<br><br><br>
bearer network to provide connection-oriented service for these services, and protect these<br>
services on the basis of connection. To this end, the IP network needs to provide a<br>
connection-oriented bearer service.<br>
The MPLS (Multi-Protocol Label Switching) technology is a new technology for<br>
providing connection over the IP network. The MPLS technology has been applied to the<br>
broadband core network and can provide connection-oriented bearer service. At present,<br>
however, the MPLS technology is applied only for the broadband core network; while for an<br>
access network, different access approaches are employed to implement the access of<br>
different types of services over the access network.<br>
At present, these different types of services are generally transmitted over different<br>
independent access networks established respectively for the services of voice, video, data<br>
and private lin.<br>
The voice service is accessed by PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network, the<br>
ordinary telephone network using TDM technology). SDH (Synchronous Digital Hierarchy)<br>
system is used for the networking of the accessing network;<br>
The data service is accessed by broadband. Direct fiber connection, Ethernet ring<br>
(using RSTP (Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol) for protection) or RPR(Resilient Packet Ring)<br>
are employed for the networking of the accessing network;;<br>
The video service is accessed by CATV(Cable Television) system. CATV system is<br>
employed for the networking of the accessing network;;<br>
The private line service is accessed by DDN (Digital Data Network, which is a private<br>
line technology based on TDM), ATM or FR network. SDH system is employed for the<br>
networking of the accessing network.<br>
It can be seen that, presently, if a variety of services are to be transmitted, investment<br>
for the corresponding network establishment are needed respectively, and the individual<br>
networks need to be maintained independently, which increases the provider's CAPEX<br>
(Capital Expenditures) and OPEX (Operating Expenditures).<br><br><br>
At present, an access network may use the MSTP (Multi-service Transport Platform)<br>
system based on SDH, to carry the data, voice and private line altogether.<br>
However, MSTP is a technology based on SDH, with low availability of bandwidth,<br>
poor flexibility of services, complex administration and maintenance, and high costs for<br>
networking and maintenance.<br>
Another way for implementing integrated service access network is based on ATM,<br>
that is, data, voice and private line can be carried together over the ATM network.<br>
However, with the enlargement of IP network, more and more applications have been<br>
transplanted to IP platform to make use of its advantages. The ATM network is not the actual<br>
development direction of network. It has low efficiency, high cost, and poor expandability,<br>
and is difficult to implement whole-network and whole-path coverage when carrying the IP<br>
services. ATM is also difficult to implement video multicast services. Furthermore, when<br>
ATM network is applied, two kinds of networks based on ATM protocol and IP protocol<br>
need to be maintained, thus complicating the administration and maintenance. So, the ATM<br>
network can not serve as the integrated service bearer platform for all services covering<br>
whole network and whole path in the aspects of bandwidth, scale and tendency, etc.<br>
Presently, the access network based on Ethernet protocol is also employed. That is, the<br>
Ethernet technology is applied between a broadband access node and a broadband access<br>
server to carry the services of data, voice, video and private line together.<br>
With the Ethernet access network, the access of pure data services can be implemented<br>
simply and efficiently at a low cost. However, there are still some issues in the bearing of<br>
integrated services.<br>
1.	survivability: the Ethernet access network of tree networking can not meet the<br>
requirements for service protection. The protection switching time of an Ethernet ring<br>
network constructed with RSTP protocol is at the level of seconds, which can not meet the<br>
switching time requirements for high quality services.<br>
2.	QoS (Quality of Service) and security: the Ethernet forwarding based on<br><br><br>
MAC(Media Access Control) address learning can not meet the security requirements for<br>
the bearing of integrated services, because its forwarding direction is unpredictable, and<br>
traffic cannot be isolated completely, and can not meet the QoS requirements for the bearing<br>
of integrated services, because bandwidth is hard to be planned.<br>
3.	A whole-network and whole-path connection across BAS (Broadband Access<br>
Server) or edge router of core network, which ensures a better quality of service for voice<br>
and private line, can not be established.<br>
4.	The traditional services of TDM, ATM, FR can not be carried, there is no standard<br>
method for carrying TDM, ATM, FR across the BAS or the edge router of core network on<br>
Ethernet.<br>
Therefore, at present, there is no unified access network which can access all the<br>
existing services, such as voice, data, video and private line, etc., at the same time with a low<br>
cost.<br>

pseudo-wire label of PWE3 in the MPLS PWE3 packet; BAS or edge router extracting<br>
Ethernet packet from the LSP after terminating the LSP; in which if BAS or edge router of<br>
core network is an intermediate node of an LSP entering at the downlink port connected to<br>
the broadband access network,, which is the case for private line across the BAS or the<br>

exchange of the MPLS packets in the LSP.<br>
It can be seen that, in the embodiments, MPLS is introduced into the broadband access<br>
network so as to implement the carrying of integrated services which deploy IP protocol,<br><br><br>
such as video, voice, data and private line and the like. Also, the traditional private line of<br>
ATM, DD"N and FR can be carried over the broadband access network. Thus the bandwidth<br>
utilization and profit of broad network can be increased, and the CAPEX and OPEX can be<br>
reduced compared with the solutions deploying several independent access networks.<br>
With the method according to the embodiments of the present invention, the access<br>
network can be conveniently unified in technology with the core network of MPLS , thus<br>
reducing the cost for operating administrating and maintaining the network. In addition,<br>
with the function of MPLS OAM and protection switching, fault location and performance<br>
monitoring are implemented in the network to decrease the maintenance cost, and the<br>
protection switch time of broadband access network can be shortened to the<br>
telecommunication level of 50 ms.<br>
Since the IP core network has been MPLSized substantially, the introduction of MPLS<br>
into access network will enable the MPLS connection covering whole network and whole<br>
path in the IP network. Besides the solution to the problem of broadband access network, the<br>
MPLSized access network also gives a route map for the aggregation of data, voice, video of<br>
three networks,.<br>

Detailed Description of the Embodiments<br>
The essence of the present invention lies in the service transmission by use of the<br>
MPLS technology over a broadband access network, by which the integrated services of<br>
IPized video, voice, data and private line (including IP private line and traditional private<br>
lines of ATM, TDM and FR) and the like, can be carried over the access network at a lower<br>
cost. MPLS is a technology which can provide multi-layer connection. The problem faced<br>
by the broadband access network serving as the bearer network of integrated services can be<br>
solved, by taking the MPLS as the means of networking of the broadband access network<br>
and private line transmission across the core network.<br>
MPLS OAM and protection switching are applied in the embodiments of the present<br>
invention, so that the protection switching time of the broadband access network can meet<br>
the requirements of the telecommunication level service.<br>
In addition, because of the label-based forwarding of MPLS, the forwarding path of an<br>
MPLS packet (including the forwarding path of a packet after protection switching) can be<br>
predicted,. Thus, the isolation between service traffics can be achieved and the privacy of<br>
information can be ensured. Furthermore, MPLS makes bandwidth planning possible,<br>
thereby the QoS of different services are guaranteed.<br>
In order to implement the method according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention, it is necessary for a broadband access node in a broadband access network to:<br>
1.	Support MPLS forwarding at the uplink port. That is, it is needed to add an uplink<br>
MPLS interface.<br>
2.	Support PWE3 (Pseudo Wire Emulation Edge-to-Edge) forwarding at the uplink<br>
port. If the carrying of the IPized MPLS integrated services needs to be supported, Ethernet<br>
PWE3 is needed. If the carrying of private line of ATM, TDM, and FR needs to be supported,<br>
MPLS PWE3 of ATM, TDM, and FR are needed correspondingly. It is necessary to be<br>
conformed with the related standards presented by the PWE3 workgroup of IETF (Internet<br>
Engineering Task Force).<br><br><br>
The broadband access node described in this context includes broadband access<br>
devices at central office (CO) and remote(RT) location under the CO, such as digital<br>
subscriber line access multiplexer (DSLAM), Ethernet access device, etc..<br>
The protocol stack of an MPLS interface of the broadband access node is shown in<br>
Fig.l, wherein:<br>
Fig. la shows that the Ethernet frame of an IPized service is carried over MPLS via<br>
PWE3, so that integrated services, such as data, VoIP(Voice over IP), and IPTV(IP<br>
Television), can be carried between the broadband access node and the broadband access<br>
server(BAS) or the edge router of core network; or an end-to-end MPLS connection to<br>
MPLS PE(Provider Edge) of the opposite side across the BAS or the edge router of core<br>
network, such as Ethernet private line service, can be implemented.<br>
Fig. lb shows that the traditional services of ATM, TDM, and FR are carried over<br>
MPLS via PWE3, and an end-to-end private line of ATM, TDM, and FR is formed to the PE<br>
device of the opposite side across the BAS or the edge router of core network, getting rid of<br>
the independent networks of ATM, DDN, and FR.<br>
The detailed implementation procedure of the method according to the embodiment of<br>
the present invention is as follows:<br>
Step 21: multiple LSPs (Label Switching Path) in a broadband access network are<br>
established. An LSP may terminate at a BAS device, or pass through the BAS device. That<br>
is, the established LSP can be the LSP only between the DSLAM (Digital Subscriber Line<br>
Access Multiplexer) and the BAS in the broadband access network, or can be the LSP<br>
starting from the DSLAM via the BAS device across the core network.<br>
The LSP includes one layer of Label or two layers of label.<br>
1.	When the LSP uses one layer of label, the LSP may terminate at the BAS or the<br>
edge router of core network. The label is used by the access network to distinguish the<br>
quality of service (QoS) of different types of services.<br>
2.	When the LSP uses two layers of label which include an outer layer label and an<br><br><br>
inner layer label, there may be a variety of application scenarios in practice.<br>
(21). When the two layers of a two-layer LSP identified respectively by the two layers<br>
of label terminate at the BAS or the edge router of core network simultaneously, the outer<br>
layer label is used by the access network to distinguish the QoS of different types of services,<br>
and the inner layer label is used by the broadband access node in the access network and<br>
BAS/the edge router of core network to identify different services and subscribers.<br>
Optionally, the inner layer label does not provide extra information, and different services<br>
and subscribers are identified by the payload carried in the inner layer LSP;<br>
(22). When the outer layer LSP identified by the outer layer label terminates at the<br>
BAS or the edge router of core network, and the inner layer LSP identified by the inner layer<br>
label passes across the BAS or the edge router of core network and terminates at the<br>
provider edge router MPLS PE of the opposite side, the outer layer label is used by the<br>
access network to distinguish the QoS of different types of services, and the inner layer label<br>
is used by the broadband access node in the access network, the BAS or the edge router of<br>
core network, and the MPLS PE of the opposite side to identify different services and<br>
subscribers. The inner layer LSP needs to be encapsulated in another outer layer LSP when it<br>
enters the core network across the BAS or the edge router of core network (if the opposite<br>
side of communication is in this access network, the inner layer LSP returns to this access<br>
network);<br>
(23). When the two layers of the two-layer LSP identified respectively by the two<br>
layers of label pass across the BAS or the edge router of core network simultaneously and<br>
terminate at the MPLS PE of the opposite side, the outer layer label provides a tunnel to the<br>
MPLS PE of the opposite side, and is used by the access network and the core network to<br>
distinguish the QoS of different types of services, and the inner layer label is used by the<br>
broadband access nodes and the MPLS PE to identify different services and subscribers.<br>
The service transmission on the basis of various LSPs described above is handled in<br>
the following manners:<br>
When an Ethernet is carried over MPLS, if the LSP established in the manner<br><br><br>
described in 1, (21) is used, a corresponding LSP can be selected for a service according to<br>
the service tag (S-TAG) in the Ethernet packet of the service. At this time, the one-layer LSP<br>
or the two-layer LSP terminates at the BAS or the edge router of core network, the LSP<br>
which is mapped from the S-TAG can be used to distinguish the QoS of different types of<br>
services in the access network. The S-TAG is the outer layer VLAN TAG of the two layers<br>
of Virtual Local Area Network Tag (VLAN TAG) defined in IEEE 802.1 AD. The S-TAG<br>
mentioned in the embodiments of the present invention also includes the one layer VLAN<br>
TAG defined in IEEE 802.1Q;<br>
When an Ethernet is carried over MPLS, if the LSP established in the manner<br>
described in (22), (23) is employed, a corresponding LSP can be selected for a service<br>
according to the service tag (S-TAG) in the Ethernet packet of the service. At this time, the<br>
LSP which is mapped from the S-TAG can be used in the access network to distinguish the<br>
QoS of different types of services. The outer layer LSP established in the manner described<br>
in (23) can also provide a tunnel through the core network to the MPLS PE of the opposite<br>
side. After the inner layer LSP which is mapped from the S-TAG terminates at the MPLS PE<br>
of the opposite side, the MPLS PE of the opposite side can distinguish different subscribers<br>
and services on the basis of the inner layer label, thus an Ethernet private line connection<br>
can be implemented between the broadband access node and the PE of the opposite side;<br>
When services of ATM, FR or TDM are carried over MPLS, the LSP established in the<br>
manner described in (22), (23) can be used to select the corresponding LSPs for the<br>
respective services according to the virtual channel connection (VCC) of an ATM packet,<br>
the data link connection identifier (DLCI) of a FR packet, and the port of TDM and the<br>
timeslots in a TDM frame. At this time, the outer layer LSP is used by the access network to<br>
distinguish the QoS of different types of services, the outer layer LSP established in the<br>
manner described in (23) can also provide a tunnel to the MPLS PE of the opposite side<br>
through the core network. After the inner layer LSP terminates at the MPLS PE of the<br>
opposite side, the MPLS PE of the opposite side can distinguish different subscribers and<br>
services on the basis of the inner layer label, thus the private line connection of ATM, FR or<br>
TDM can be implemented between the broadband access node and the PE of the opposite<br><br><br>
side;<br>
Step 22: when the broadband access node needs to transmit a service upward, a<br>
corresponding LSP is selected at the source broadband access node of the service according<br>
to the type of the service, the quality of service (QoS) and the subscriber information of the<br>
service, and then the service is transmitted over the corresponding LSP.<br>
In step 22, the processing procedure of the broadband access node includes the process<br>
in the case that the Ethernet frame is carried over MPLS and the process in the case that the<br>
ATM/TDM/FR is carried over MPLS, which are described in detail respectively as follows:<br>
1. when the Ethernet frame is carried over MPLS,<br>
if an MPLS packet in the broadband access network terminates at the BAS, or terminates<br>
at the access aggregation device prior to the BAS, the payload carried in the MPLS<br>
packet will identify the services and subscribers by way of 802.1Q or 802.IAD of<br>
Ethernet. After the MPLS connection is terminated, the BAS or the device terminating<br>
the MPLS packet prior to BAS extracts the payload carried in the MPLS packet directly<br>
and identifies the services and subscribers by way of 802.1Q or 802.1 AD. At this time,<br>
MPLS is only the networking means for carrying the integrated services of the access<br>
aggregation layer. Thus, the VLAN plan can be kept the same as of the old network, and<br>
the processing of the broadband access node and the BAS can be simplified.<br>
A pseudo-wire is mapped on the basis of the S-TAG for an upstream service on the<br>
broadband access node. The S-TAG and pseudo-wire are mapped to each other in the<br>
one-to-one map. That is, a corresponding LSP is selected for the upstream service according<br>
to the S-TAG of the service traffic, and each S-TAG corresponds to one LSP. After the<br>
downstream pseudo-wire sent down to the broadband access node is terminated by the<br>
broadband access node, the Ethernet frame is recovered from the MPLS packet. The<br>
subsequent processing procedure by the broadband access node is the same as the procedure<br>
without MPLS transmission.<br>
For the Ethernet private line across the BAS or the edge router of core network, since<br><br><br>
the S-TAGs are allocated locally in the access networks, the S-TAGs allocated in the access<br>
networks at the two ends of the same private line may be different. Therefore, after the LSP<br>
is terminated, it may be needed to replace the outer layer S-TAG, that is, the outer layer<br>
S-TAG may be replaced by the actual S-TAG value of the local end access network.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the MPLS label can also be used as the<br>
means of access network for identifying the subscribers and services. At this time, the outer<br>
layer label of Ethernet PWE3 is used by access layer networking to distinguish the QoS of<br>
different type services. The inner layer label is used by the BAS to identify different services<br>
and subscribers. At this time, the BAS is needed to be changed correspondingly so as to<br>
identify different services and subscribers on the basis of the inner layer label.<br>
2. when the ATM/TDM/FR is carried over MPLS<br>
if the ATM/TDM/FR is carried over MPLS, generally, one pseudo-wire starting from<br>
the broadband access node and passing across the BAS or the edge router of core network<br>
is needed to be established. That is, a private line across the BAS or the edge router of core<br>
network is emulated by carrying the traditional services of ATM, TDM and FR over MPLS<br>
via PWE3. For an ATM service, it is necessary for the broadband access node to support the<br>
ATM exchange, that is, the VPI (Virtual Path Identifier)/VCI (Virtual Circuit Identifier) in<br>
the ingress/egress ATM cell is replaced, and the VCC is used to select the pseudo-wire LSP<br>
carried in the outer layer LSP of MPLS. The VCC and the pseudo-wire are mapped to each<br>
other one to one, that is, one VCC corresponds to one LSP. For a TDM service, the<br>
timeslots in TDM frame and the port are used to select the pseudo-wire LSP. For a FR<br>
service, DLCI is used to select the pseudo-wire LSP.<br>
In step 22, in addition to the support of MPLS at the uplink port, BAS or edge router<br>
of core network also needs to:<br>
1.	support MPLS forwarding at the downlink port, and<br>
2.	support the related standards of IETF PWE3 workgroup, if the BAS or the edge<br>
router of core network is the end point of the corresponding pseudo-wire LSP of Ethernet,<br><br><br>
ATM, TDM and FR.<br>
If the BAS or the edge router of core network is the end point of LSP entering at the<br>
downlink port connected to the broadband access network, 802.1Q or 802.1 AD in a PWE3<br>
packet can still be employed to identify the services and subscribers. At this time, after<br>
terminating the LSP, the BAS extracts the Ethernet packet from the LSP. Then the<br>
processing is the same as the method before the MPLS was introduced. Furthermore, the<br>
pseudo-wire labels of PWE3 packets can also be used as identities of the services and<br>
subscribers.<br>
When the BAS or the edge router of core network serves as the intermediate node of<br>
LSP entering at the downlink port connected to the broadband access network, for the<br>
private line across the BAS or the edge router of core network, the BAS or the edge router<br>
of core network is required to support MPLS exchange of MPLS packets entering at the<br>
downlink port.<br>
The broadband access node, the BAS or the edge router of core network according to<br>
the embodiments of the present invention are required to the support MPLS OAM and<br>
protection switching, particularly, they are required to:<br>
(1)	support the OAM described in ITU-T Y.1711, so as to acquire the connectivity<br>
state of each LSP and to know in real time whether each LSP can transmit the services<br>
normally;<br>
(2)	support the MPLS protection switching described in ITU-T Y.1720. Thus, when a<br>
failure is detected by the OAM function showing that the LSP is disconnected, the services<br>
carried and transmitted by the LSP are switched onto a standby LSP.<br>
A particular application in an actual network of the present invention will be<br>
described below with reference to the accompanying drawings. The access layer<br>
networking application, as well as the MPLS connection application over whole network<br>
and whole path will be described respectively hereinafter.<br>
The access layer networking application includes the access layer networking of the<br><br><br>
IPized services and the access layer networking of the integrated services, as shown<br>
respectively in Fig.2 and Fig.3. The thick solid lines in the figures represent the LSPs of<br>
MPLS. CO represents the physical location of a central office; RT represents the physical<br>
location of a remote access device below the central offices; The broadband access device<br>
(such as DSLAM, Ethernet switch, etc.), the PSTN access device, the ATM access device<br>
or the FR access device or the like, can be deployed at the COs and RTs according to the<br>
different types of the access services. RG represents the residence gateway of a broadband<br>
home subscriber.<br>
As shown in Fig.2, the IP services are transmitted via the MPLS networking, while<br>
the traditional services of ATM, TDM and FR and the like are still accessed to the central<br>
offices via other access networks and are then accessed to different core networks. In Fig.3,<br>
the IP services are transmitted via the MPLS networking, the services of ATM, TDM and<br>
FR and the like are also carried over MPLS by PWE3; thus, only the MPLS access network<br>
is reserved in the broadband access network, and the integrated services can be carried in<br>
the MPLS access network; that is, the IP services and the services of ATM, TDM and FR<br>
are all transmitted in the broadband access network via LSP.<br>
In Fig.2, as described above, for the IP services, besides that the MPLS is used for<br>
access layer networking, the MPLS label can also be used by the BAS to identify the<br>
subscribers and services. MPLS label, instead of VLAN label, can overcome the<br>
insufficiencies of space in identifying subscribers and services, and make the service<br>
management more flexible.<br>
The entire network MPLS connection can be classified into the entire network MPLS<br>
connection of IP service and the entire network MPLS connection of integrated service, as<br>
shown respectively in Fig.4 and Fig.5. Similarly, the thick solid lines in the figures<br>
represent LSPs based on MPLS protocol.<br>
As shown in Fig.4, for services based on session, VPN (Virtual private network),<br>
private line or other service passing across the tunnel of the BAS or the edge router of core<br>
network among all the IP services, an Ethernet pseudo-wire passing across the BAS or the<br><br><br>
edge router of core network may be established to the PE (Provider Edge) of the opposite<br>
side through the core network to implement the connection covering whole network and<br>
whole path. Accordingly, the QoS, security and survivability can be better ensured by taking<br>
the advantages of MPLS.<br>
As shown in Fig.5, besides that the IP services can establish the PE-to-PE whole-path<br>
connection, the statically configured private lines of TDM, ATM and FR can also migrate<br>
in whole path to the IP network via PWE3, getting rid of the DDN(Digital Data Network),<br>
ATM or FR networks. The PSTN core network is not needed for the call-based voice<br>
services until the voice service migrate to VoIP, i.e. until the TDM voice service is IPized in<br>
the NGN (Next Generation Network). At this time, the IP network can serve as the unified<br>
bearer platform over the entire network.<br>

preferred embodiments, the present invention is not limited to these. Those skilled in the art<br>
shall readily recognize that various variations and modifications can be made without<br>
departing from the protection scope of the present invention. These variations and<br>
