				<td>PAPER WITH IMPROVED STIFFNESS AND BULK AND<br>
METHOD FOR MAKING SAME<br>
A PAPER OR PAPERBOARD HAVING IMPROVED BULK<br>
AND STIFFNESS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to the papermaking arts and, in particular, to the manufacture of<br>
paper substrates. This invention also relates to articles manufactured from the substrates of<br>
this invention such as printing paper and paperboard articles.<br>
RELATED APPLICATION<br>
This application claims the benefit of United States Provisional Application Serial No.<br>
60/410,666, filed September 13, 2002..<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The contemporary work and home offices use a multitude of paper products<br>
including, but not limited to reprographic paper grades and paperboard., such as writing<br>
papers, printing paper, copy paper, and forms paper. Unfortunately, such paper and<br>
paperboard products exhibit one or more disadvantages. For example, some of these<br>
products have relatively low basis weights or are not sufficiently stiff in bending or durable to<br>
sustain a full run through a copy machine. Thus, within the industry there is a constant aim to<br>
produce reprographic papers at lower basis weights, but at equal stiffness properties, in order<br>
to save raw materials and to be able to increase productivity. Other important properties of<br>
reprographic papers are curl, i.e.. out-of-plane movement, and hygroexpansivity, i.e.<br>
expansion and contraction of the paper with varying relative humidities. A low curl is<br>
required during stacking of paper in copier machines and for correct feeding. A low<br>
hygroexpansivity is required because curl is a. function of the hygroexpansivity, and of the<br>
material distribution in the sheet (see e.g. Carlsson, L.: A Study of the Bending Properties of<br>
Paper and their Relation to the Layered Structure, Doctoral thesis, Chalmers University of<br>
Technology, Department of Polymeric Materials, Gothenburg, Sweden, 1980, ISBN 91-7032-<br>
003-9). The hygroexpansivity and curl are also a function of the paperrnaking process,<br>
especially during drying of a fibrous web (see e.g. Handbook of Physical Testing of Paper,<br>
2nd Edition, Vol. 1, Chapter 3, page 115-117, ISBN 0-8247-0498-3 by T. Uesaka:<br>
Dimensional Stability and Environmental Effects on Paper Properties). The bending stiffness<br>
Sb of paper is a function of the elastic modulus E and the thickness t, such that Sb is<br>
proportional to Et3. This means that the most effective means to increase the bending stiffness<br>
is by increasing the paper thickness. However, the thickness normally must be retained within<br>
specifications. An even more efficient way to increase bending stiffness is to create an I-<br>
beam effect, i.e. strong dense outer layers and a lower density core. Mathematical expressions<br>
of a three-layered structure show that the I-beam effect creates considerably higher bending<br>
stiffness compared to a homogeneous structure if all other parameters are kept constant (see<br>
e.g. Handbook of Physical Testing of Paper, 2nd Edition, Vol. 1, Chapter 5, page 233-256,<br>
ISBN 0-8247-0498-3 by C. Fellers and L.A. Carlsson: Bending Stiffness, with Special<br>
Reference to Paperboard). This knowledge has been reduced to practice in multi-ply<br>
paperboard as well as for low basis weight printing papers, such as reprographic papers (see<br>
e.g. Haggblom-Ahnger, U., 1998, Three-ply office paper, Doctoral thesis, Abo Akademi<br>
University, Turku, Finland, 1998).<br>
Modem size-press units of paper machines produce reprographic paper grades<br>
commonly having metered size-presses. These units enable the application of size-press<br>
starch (and/or other strengthening components) to other layers of the sheet. This technology<br>
has been demonstrated in the published literature (see e.g. Lipponen, J. et al.: Surface Sizing<br>
with Starch Solutions at High Solids Contents, 2002 Tappi Metered Size Press Forum,<br>
Orlando, FL, May 1-4, 2002, Tappi Press 2002, ISBN 1-930657-91-9). The authors<br>
concluded a significant bending stiffness improvement running the starch solution at the size-<br>
press at 18 % solids compared to lower solids (8, 12 and 15 %).<br>
There are also flooded-nip (also called pond or puddle) size-press units in common<br>
use. In this instance the potential for application of starch solutions to the outer layers is not<br>
the same as for metered size-press units due to inherent deeper penetration into the sheet in<br>
the flooded-nip. However, results in the literature suggest that an increase in starch solids can<br>
also cause less penetration with potential for improved bending stiffness (see e.g. Bergh, N.-<br>
O.: Surface Treatment on Paper with Starch from the Viewpoint of Production Increase, XXI<br>
EUCEPA International Conference, Vol. 2, Conferencias nos. 23 a 43, Torremolinos, Spain,<br>
page 547-, 1984). There is, however, room for considerable improvement in bending stiffness<br>
over the results reported in the literature and to receive other benefits such as stated above.<br>
Accordingly, there exists a need for improved paper and paperboard products that<br>
reduce or eliminate one or more of these disadvantages while being able to produce<br>
paperboard and reprographic paper grades at considerably lower basis weights, at higher<br>
production rates, and, consequently, at lower manufacturing costs. Such an improvement<br>
would benefit from increased bulk of the paper web before the size-press application (n.b. the<br>
large influence of paper thickness on bending stiffness) in combination with high solids<br>
 starch solutions including viscosity modifiers and/or crosslinkers to increase the strength of<br>
the size-press coating and to increase hold-out attachment of the surface to the applied layer.<br>
Further, it is the object of this invention to provide these benefits within a single-ply paper,<br>
thereby eliminating the costs associated with the additional machinery required for paper<br>
having multiple cellulosic layers.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

 ACCOMPANYING<br>
 BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES/DRAWINGS<br>
Fig. 1 is a schematic illustration of the three layered paper of the invention, achieved<br>
by bulking the base sheet and using high solids starch including viscosity<br>
modifiers/fillers/cross-linkers.<br>
Fig. 2 is a schematic illustration of a paper machine process.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
A paper 10 in accordance with one embodiment of the invention is shown in Fig. 1,<br>
wherein the term "paper", as used herein, includes not only paper and the production thereof,<br>
but also other web-like products, such as board and paperboard and the production thereof. A<br>
flat, bulked cellulosic core layer 12 is coated on both sides by a high strength starch based<br>
size-press coating 14. The cellulosic fibers are formed from a chemical pulp furnish having a<br>
mixture of hardwood and softwood fibers with additional fillers such as precipitated calcium<br>
carbonate or other fillers known in the art. The fibers may also be interspersed with<br>
surfactants, retention agents or other additives typically added to paper products. The precise<br>
ratio of softwood to hardwood fibers can vary within the scope of the invention. Ideally, the<br>
ratio of hardwood to softwood fibers varies between 3:1 and 10:1. However, other<br>
hardwood/softwood ratios or other types of fibers can be used, such as fibers from chemical<br>
pulp such as sulphate, and sulphite pulps, wood-containing or mechanical pulp such as<br>
fhermomechanical pulp, cherno-thermomechanical pulp, refiner pulp and groundwood pulp.<br>
The fibers can also be based on recycled fibers, optionally from de-inked pulps, and mixtures<br>
thereof.<br><br>
Cellulosic core layer 12 is a low density core bulked up by a bulking agent, thus<br>
achieving increased thickness. The preferred embodiment uses a diamide salt based bulking<br>
agent such as mono- and distearamid.es of animoethylethalonalamine, commercially known<br>
as Reactopaque 100, (Omnova Solutions Inc., Performance Chemicals, 1476 J.A. Cochran<br>
By-Pass, Chester, SC 29706, USA and marketed and sold by Ondeo Nalco Co., with<br>
headquarters at Ondeo Nalco Center, Naperville, IL 60563, USA) in about 0.025 to about<br>
0.25 wt% by weight dry basis. However, various chemical bulking agents known in art can<br>
be used, such as quaternized imidazoline or microspheres, wherein the microspheres are<br>
made from a polymeric material selected from the group consisting of methyl methacrylate,<br>
ortho-chlorostyrene, polyortho-chlorostyrene, polyvinylbenzyl chloride, acrylonitrile,<br>
vinylidene chloride, para-tert-butyl styrene, vinyl acetate, butyl acrylate, styrene, methacrylic<br>
acid, vinylbenzyl chloride and combinations of two or more of the foregoing. Core layer 12<br>
may contain other materials, such as surfactants, retention agents and fillers known in the art.<br>
The use of retention agents are generally preferred if microspheres are utilized as the bulking<br>
agent. In the preferred embodiment utilizing diamide salt, no retention agents are required.<br>
In the preferred embodiment, starch based coating layers 14 cover both surfaces of the<br>
core layer. The high density coatings cover an upper and lower surface of the lower density<br>
bulked cellulose core, creating an I-beam effect that is a three-layered single-ply paper<br>
product. In other embodiments, only one side of the cellulosic core layer may be coated with<br>
a starch size press coating. The high strength coatings are formed from starch based<br>
solutions in a solids range of 6-20 %, but preferably more starch strength than a typical paper<br>
yet low enough to prevent excessive penetration of the coatings into the core layers.<br>
Commercial embodiments of the present invention generally use solid content of about 6-<br>
12%. However, in other preferred embodiments, high stiffness can be achieved with starch<br>
solids of about 18%.<br>
The coating penetrates the cellulose core layer minimally or not at all. As a result,<br>
starch can be substantially absent from the cellulose core. The control of the penetration is<br>
ideally achieved with a metered size press coating, such that the thickness of the outer film<br>
can be closely monitored. In preferred embodiments, the ratio of the film thicknesses of the<br>
starch coating layers to the paper as a whole is between 1:50 and 1:1.1. The porosity levels<br>
of the paper also effects coating penetration. Controlling the thickness and penetration is key<br>
to create three separate adjacent layers that form the I-beam structure having high strength<br>
outer coatings around a lower density core.<br>
The starches used in the coating can be any starch typically used in a coating,<br>
preferably a hydroxy ethylated starch, oxidized starch, cationically modified or enzymatically<br>
converted starch from any regularly used starch source, such as from potato, corn, wheat, rice<br>
or tapioca. The coating may further contain viscosity modifiers, cross-linkers and pigments<br>
such as polyvinyl alcohols, ammonium zirconium carbonate, borate chemicals, glyoxal,<br>
melamine formaldehyde, ground and precipitated calcium carbonates, clays, talc, TiO2, and<br>
silica.<br>
As completed, the basis weight of paper 10 is generally in the range of 59-410 g/m2<br>
and the coating has a basis weight between 2 and 10 g/m2<br>
Figure 2 depicts a schematic that is one embodiment of a method used for formulating<br>
the paper of Figure 1. Numerous types of papermaking machines are known, many with<br>
variants of a typical wet-end/dry end type machine. Thus, the present invention is not limited<br>
to a specific type of paper making machine such as the one represented in the schematic of<br>
Fig. 2.<br>
A bulking agent 20 is added to a furnish during the wet-end of the paper making<br>
machine, wherein the furnish may further comprise additives including fillers, retention aids,<br>
surfactants, and other substances typically added to wet end paper furnished that are known<br>
in the art. In the present embodiment, the preferred bulking agent is a diamide salt based<br>
product (Reactopaque 100). However, other bulking agents may be used within the spirit of<br>
the invention.<br>
The wet-end further comprises a refiner 22 for mechanical treatment of the pulp, a<br>
machine chest 32, a headbox 24 that discharges a wide jet of the furnish onto a wire section<br>
to form a fibrous paper web, a wire section 26 having a moving screen of extremely fine<br>
mesh, a press section 28, and a dryer section 34 comprising a plurality of support rolls that<br>
dries the fibrous web and conveys it to the size press.<br>
A starch based coating is mixed in a mix-tank 30. The starch used is preferably a<br>
hydroxy ethylated starch, oxidized starch, cationically modified or enzymatically converted<br>
starch from any regularly used starch source, such as from potato, com, wheat, rice or<br>
tapioca. In the present embodiment, starch is cooked and added to the mix-tank with<br>
viscosity modifiers, cross-linkers and fillers such as one or more of the following: polyvinyl<br>
alcohols, ammonium zirconium carbonate, borate chemicals, glyoxal, melamine<br>
formaldehyde, ground and precipitated calcium carbonates, clays, talc, TiO2, and silica.. The<br>
starch may be cooked with a borate chemical in a starch cooker 38 prior to entry into the mix-<br>
tank. The mixed coating is conveyed to a size press tank and then size pressed onto the paper<br>
web, coating one or both sides of the web. The starch based coating preferably has starch<br>
solids in the range of 6-20% by weight. The coating layers may be added simultaneously or<br>
in series in accordance with one of two techniques typically used in the industry. The paper's<br>
thickness, weight, stiffness and curl resistance are largely the same with either technique.<br>
The size press-treatment used is preferably a metered size-press application. Due to<br>
the nature of the metered size press, application of starch solids can be controlled and<br>
normalized. As a result, penetration of the starch coating into the cellulosic core layer is<br>
minimal, maintaining the I-beam effect of the three-layer single ply structure. Even so, other<br><br>
size-presses known in the art. such as a flooded-nip size-press application, may be used. In<br>
this instance the potential for application of starch solutions to the outer layers is not the same<br>
as for metered size-press units due to inherent deeper penetration into the sheet in the<br>
flooded-nip.<br>
The coated paper web is then conveyed to the size-press treatment in the dry end 36 of<br>
the paper making machine, wherein the dry end typically comprises a multiplicity of steam<br>
heated, rotating cylinders under a heat confining hood structure in proximity to the paper web<br>
traveling route to further dry the paper after size press application.<br>
The resultant paper substrate exhibits one or more enhanced properties as compared to<br>
substrates that do not include the bulking additive and/or the high solids starch size-press in<br>
combination with viscosity modifiers and/or cross-linkers. For example, for some<br>
embodiments of this invention, the substrate exhibits improved Sheffield Smoothness (TAPPI<br>
538om-88)) on both wire side and felt side of the substrate in contrast to the same substrate<br>
without the above mentioned ingredients, thus enabling less calendering with retained bulk.<br>
Further, the paper exhibits improved curl resistance, a property of greatest importance<br>
for end-user performance of reprographic grades, improved hygroexpansivity, and enhanced<br>
Lorentzon &amp; Wettre Bending Resistance. Other benefits of the invention include a more<br>
closed sheet and/or an enhanced possibility to target a certain porosity of the paper, resulting<br>
in higher Gurley numbers (TAPPI T460 om-96). This is beneficial as reprographic papers are<br>
usually fed through copier machines using vacuum suction to lift the sheets.<br>
The following non-limiting examples illustrate various additional aspects of the<br>
invention. Unless otherwise indicated, temperatures are in degrees Celsius, paper basis<br>
weight is in grams per square meter and the percent of any pulp additive or moisture is based<br>
on the oven-dry weight of the total amount of material.<br><br>
Example 1<br>
A series of trials were made on a paper machine equipped with a flooded-nip size-<br>
press. Paper was made from a mixture of about 9 parts hardwood and 1 part softwood and<br>
containing 19 % filler (precipitated calcium carbonate). A standard AKD size was added as<br>
internal size and a standard surface size was added to the size-press together with the starch<br>
solution. The trial commenced with addition of Reactopaque 100 to the hardwood pulp chest<br>
before refining. The addition rate was ramped up to 0.15 % and the size-press coating having<br>
enzymatically converted corn starch was changed to contain starch at higher solids (10 %<br>
instead of the standard 8 %) in combination with 5 parts based on starch of glyoxal (Sequarez<br>
755, Omnova Solutions Inc., SC, USA) and 25 parts based on starch of ground calcium<br>
carbonate, (Omyafil OG, Omya, Inc., Alpharetta, GA, USA). One condition was run at these<br>
settings, then the size-press coating was switched back to starch without glyoxal and filler<br>
while maintaining the higher solids. The last condition maintained these settings but<br>
decreasing the paper basis weight in order to evaluate the impact of bending stiffness. Table 1<br>
gives the results in Lorentzon &amp; Wettre bending resistance (bending stiffness), paper caliper<br>
and Bendtsen porosity as compared to a control without a bulking agent and standard starch<br>
solids. Condition 2 shows an increase over the control in caliper and in bending stiffness and<br>
a decrease in the porosity number. Condition 2 also showed a smoother surface as determined<br>
from the Bendtsen smoothness number, which decreased from 225 / 210 ml/min (wire/felt<br>
side) to 205 / 195 ml/min (wire/felt side). This and the decreased porosity for condition 2 can<br>
be attributed to the filler closing the surface and creating a smoother surface. The most<br>
important finding is when comparing Condition 2, 3 and 4 with Condition 1 (control). The<br>
caliper increases Avith addition of Reactopaque and the bending stiffness goes up as a result of<br><br>
the increased caliper in combination with increased starch located to the surface layers. The<br>
overall starch content in the sheet also increased as a result of the more open sheet (higher<br>
Bendtsen porosity number). Condition 4 compared to Condition 1 is especially important as it<br>
shows that the increased bending stiffness allows for the basis weight to be decreased while<br>
maintaining almost the same stiffness as the control.<br>
Example 2<br>
A series of papers were evaluated in metered size-press trials. A test base paper was<br>
produced at 90 gram per square meter without Reactopaque 100. Control CI using this base<br>
paper was given a size press coating of 2 g/m2, control C2 was given a size press coating of 5<br>
g/m2, and control C3 was given a size press coating of 8 g/m2. The controls were run in side-<br>
by-side comparisons on a metered size-press unit with a series of test papers produced with<br>
88 gram per square meter with 0.18 % Reactopaque 100 added before hardwood refining.<br>
The test base papers were given a size-press coating containing hydroxy ethylated corn starch<br>
(Ethylex 2035 from A.E. Staley Manufacturing Co., Decatur, IL, USA) at higher solids (18 %<br>
instead of the standard 8 %) in combinatic; with glyoxal and a filler (ground calcium<br>
carbonate). The size-pressed coated papers were tested for bending stiffness, smoothness and<br>
porosity. In order to summarize the results, bending stiffness was plotted as a function of<br>
smoothness and results evaluated at a Sheffield smoothness of 120 after steel to steel<br>
calendering. Gurley porosity and Sheffield smoothness numbers are given for the un-<br>
calendared papers. The coefficient of hygroexpansion was evaluated on paper strips in<br>
machine and cross-machine direction using a Varidim hygroexpansivity tester (Techpap,<br>
Grenoble, France). Hygroexpansion was measured between 15 and 90 % relative humidity<br>
from which the coefficient of hygroexpansion was calculated.<br>
Different additives for the starch solutions were selected from the list below:<br>
• Sodium tetraborate pentahydrate, borax (Neobor from US Borax, CA, USA) added in<br>
0.25 % on starch before the starch was cooked.<br>
• Glyoxal (Sequarez 755, Omnova Solutions Inc., SC, USA) added in 5 % on starch in<br>
combination with precipitated calcium carbonate added in 50 % based on starch<br>
(Megafil 2000, Specialty Minerals, PA, USA)<br>
• Polyvinyl alcohol (Celvol 325 from Celenese Chemicals, TX, USA) added in 5 % on<br>
starch.<br>
Table 2 shows the results. The combination of high starch solids and viscosity<br>
modifier/filler/cross-linker increases bending stiffness by over 20 % over the control. High<br>
starch solids alone also give some benefit but the surprising result is the overall impact on<br>
several important paper properties by the bulking and size-press application.. The; size-press<br>
application gives a more closed sheet as seen from the increasing Gurley porosity numbers,<br>
the base paper containing the bulking additive is smoother and the coefficient of<br>
hygroexpansion is significantly lower for the conditions with the combination of high starch<br>
solids and viscosity modifier/filler/cross-linker.<br>
Example 3<br>
A series of papers were formed from a mixture of 8 parts Northern hardwood pulp<br>
and 2 parts Northern softwood pulp and having 20 % filler, precipitated calcium carbonate<br>
(Megafil 2000) from Specialty Minerals. The pulps were refined together and having a<br>
Canadian Standard Freeness of about 450 ml. A standard AK.D size (Hereon 70) from<br>
Hercules was added in the wet-end to give the base sheet a Hercules size test number of 50-<br>
100 seconds. Reactopaque 100 at 0.17 wt%) was added before refining at a temperature of<br>
the pulp of 54 C (130 F) to achieve the bulking effect. The papers were tested for heated curl<br>
with a proprietary instrument developed for such measurements at assignee's International<br>
Paper's research center. The results are given in Table 3. It is shown that the addition of<br>
Reactopaque 100 to the base sheet gives a significant reduction in the curl number (a<br>
difference in 5 units is considered to be a significant difference.)<br>
Although the invention has been described with reference to preferred embodiments,<br>
it will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that numerous modifications are<br>
possible in light of the above disclosure. For example, the optimum amount of bulking agent<br>
used with different types and ratios of cellulosic fibers may vary. All such variations and<br>
