				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001]      The present invention relates generally to embryonic steins cells, and more<br>
specifically to a process for obtaining human embryonic stem cells using parthenogenically<br>
activated oocytes.<br>
BACKGROUND INFORMATION<br>
10002]      Human embryonic stem cells (ES) cells are pluripotent cells that can differentiate<br>
into a large array of cell types. When injected into immune-deficient mice, embryonic stem<br>
cells form differentiated tumors (teratomas). However, embryonic stem cells that are induced<br>
in vitro to form embryoid bodies (EBs) provide a source of embryonic stem cell lines that are<br>
amenable to differentiation into multiple cell types characteristic of several tissues under<br>
certain growth conditions. For example, ES cells become differentiated into neurons in the<br>
presence of nerve growth factor and retinoic acid.<br>
[0003]      Human ES cells and their differentiated progeny are important sources of normal<br>
human cells for therapeutic transplantation and for drug testing and development. Required<br>
by both of these goals is the provision of sufficient cells that are differentiated into tissue<br>
types suitable for a patient's needs or the appropriate pharmacological test. Associated with<br>
this is a need for an efficient and reliable method of producing differentiated cells from<br>
embryonic stem cells.<br>
10004]      Currently, human embryonic stem cells (hES) are derived from three sources:<br>
blastocysts remaining after infertility treatments and donated foT research, blastocysts<br>
generated from donated gametes (oocytes and sperm), and the products of nuclear transfer<br>
(NT). Cadaveric fetal tissue is the only source of human embryonic germ cells (hEG). hES<br>
and hEG cells offer remarkable scientific and therapeutic possibilities, involving potential for<br>
generating more specialized cells or tissues. Ethical concerns about the sources of hES and<br>
hEG cells, however, and fears that use of NT for research could lead to use of NT to produce<br>
a human being, have fostered a great deal of public discussion and debate.<br>
[0005]      Parthenogenic activation of mammalian oocytes may be used as an alterative to<br>
fertilization by sperm/NT to prepare oocytes for embryonic stem cell generation.<br>
Parthenogenic activation is the production of embryonic cells, with or without eventual<br>
development into an adult, from a female gamete in the absence of any contribution from a<br>
male gamete.<br>
[0006]     Parthenogenetic activation of mammalian oocytes has been induced in a number of<br>
ways. Using an electrical stimulus to induce activation is of particular interest because<br>
electrofusion is part of the current nuclear transfer procedure. Parthenogenetic activation in<br>
vitro by electrical stimulation with electrofusion apparatus used for embryonic cell-oocyte<br>
membrane fusion has been reported.<br>
[0007]      Mouse oocytes have been activated by exposure to Ca+2 -Mg+2 free medium,<br>
medium containing hyaluronidase, exposure to ethanol, Ca+2 ionophores or chelators,<br>
inhibitors of protein synthesis, and electrical stimulation. These procedures have led to high<br>
rates of parthenogenic activation and development of mouse oocytes, but did not activate<br>
and/or lead to a lower development rate of young bovine oocytes. Further, fertilization and<br>
parthenogenic activation of mouse oocytes is also dependent on post ovulatory aging.<br>
[0008]      Activation of bovine oocytes has been reported by ethanol, electrical stimulation,<br>
exposure to room temperature, and a combination of electrical stimulation and protein<br>
inhibition with cycloheximide. While these processes are thought to raise intracellular Ca+2,<br>
they are most successful when the oocytes have been aged for more than 28 hours.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0010]      The present invention is based on the seminal discovery that certain conditions are<br>
optimal for parthenogenically activating human oocytes.<br>
[0011]      In one embodiment, a method of producing human stem cells is provided including<br>
parthenogenetically activating an oocyte, where activation includes contacting the oocyte<br>
with an ionophore at high oxygen (O2) tension and contacting the oocyte with a serine-<br>
threonine kinase inhibitor under low O2 tension, cultivating the activated oocyte at low O2<br>
tension until blastocyst formation, transferring the blastocyst to a layer of feeder cells, and<br>
culturing the transferred blastocyst under high O2 tension, mechanically isolating an inner<br>
cell mass (ICM) from trophectoderm of the blastocyst, and culturing the cells of the ICM on a<br>
layer of feeder cells, where culturing the ICM cells is carried out under high O2 tension.<br>
Preferably, the oocyte is human.<br>
<br>
|0012]     In a related aspect, low O2 tension is maintained by incubation in a gas mixture<br>
environment comprising an O2 concentration of about 2% O2 to about 5% O2, where the gas<br>
mixture environment further comprises about 5% CO2 and about 90% nitrogen (N2) to 93%<br>
N2.<br>
[0013]      In another embodiment, a method of activating human metaphase II oocytes is<br>
provided including incubating human metaphase II oocytes in in vitro fertilization (IVF)<br>
media under high O2 tension, activating by incubating the cells in IVF media comprising an<br>
ionophore under high O2 tension, and subsequently incubating the cells in IVF media<br>
comprising a serine-threonine kinase inhibitor (STKI) under low O2 tension, and incubating<br>
the STKI treated cells until blastocyst formation under low O2 tension, where inner cell<br>
masses (ICM) obtained from the blastocyst produce culturable stem cells. High O2 tension<br>
may be maintained by incubating the cells in a gas mixture environment having about 5%<br>
CO2, about 20% O2, and about 75% N2.<br>
[0014]   .  In a related aspect, the O2 tension for the incubating steps subsequent to activation<br>
is maintained by incubating the cells in a gas mixture environment comprising an O2<br>
concentration of about 2% O2 to about 5% O2, where the gas mixture environment further<br>
includes about 5% CO2 and about 90% N2 to about 93% N2.<br>
[0015]      In another related aspect, the IVF media is essentially free of non-human products.<br>
[0016]     In a further related aspect, isolated oocytes prepared by the invention methods are<br>
provided, including isolated inner cell masses (ICM) prepared from such oocytes and<br>
corresponding stem cells isolated therefrom.<br>
[0017]      In another embodiment, human parthenogenic activation of mammalian oocytes<br>
resulting in embryogenic stem cells and their differentiated progeny is provided. Such cells<br>
and progeny are substantially isogenic to the oocyte donor, thus allowing for autologous<br>
transplantation of cells relative to the oocyte donor, and rejection by the oocyte donor's<br>
immune system is typically avoided.<br>
[0018]      In a related aspect, a cell bank of hES cell lines derived from parthenogenically<br>
activated oocytes is provided.<br>
[0019]      In one embodiment, a method for producing human stem cells from a<br>
cryopreserved oocyte OT parthenote is provided, including microinjecting into the cytoplasm<br>
<br>
of the oocyte or parthenote a cryopreservation agent, freezing the oocyte or parthenote to a<br>
cryogenic temperature to cause it to enter a dormant state, storing the oocyte or parthenote in<br>
the dormant state, thawing the oocyte or parthenote, parthenogenically activating the oocyte,<br>
where the activation includes contacting the oocyte with an ionophore at high O2 tension and<br>
contacting the oocyte with a serine-threonine kinase inhibitor under low 02 tension,<br>
cultivating the parthenote or activated oocyte under low O2 tension until blastocyst formation,<br>
isolating an inner cell mass (ICM) from the trophectoderm of the blastocyst, and culturing the<br>
cells of the ICM on a layer of feeder cells, where culturing is carried out under high O2<br>
tension.<br>
[0020]      In another embodiment, autologous stem cells derived from parthenogenetically<br>
activated oocytes from a human donor are provided. In one aspect, the stem cells possess a<br>
substantially identical haplotype as the donor cell. In a related aspect, stem cells are<br>
substantially identical genetically to the donor cell.<br>
[0021J      In one aspect, a stem cell is identified as a full sibling of the donor according to<br>
single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. In another aspect, a stem cell is genomically<br>
imprinted according to donor origin.<br>
[0022]      In one embodiment, a differentiated cell derived from a stem cell obtained from a<br>
parthenogenetically activated oocyte from a human donor is disclosed. In a related aspect,<br>
the differentiated cell includes, but is not limited to, a neuronal cell, a cardiac cell, a smooth<br>
muscle cell, a striated muscle cell, an endothelial cell, an osteoblast, an oligodendrocyte, a<br>
hematopoietic cell, an adipose cell, a stromal cell, a chondrocyte, an astrocyte, a dendritic<br>
cell, a keratinocyte, a pancreatic islet, a lymphoid precursor cell, a mast cell, a mesodermal<br>
cell, and an endodermal cell. In a further related aspect, the differentiated cell expresses one<br>
or more markers, including but not limited to, neurofiliment 68, NCAM, beta m-tubulin,<br>
GFAP, alpha-actinin, desmin, PECAM-1; VE-Cadherin, alpha-fetoprotein, or a combination<br>
thereof.<br>
[0023]      In another embodiment, a cell line comprising autologous stem cells is disclosed,<br>
where the stem cells are derived from parthenogenetically activated oocytes from a human<br>
donor. In one aspect, the cells do not express SSEA-1. In another aspect, the cells of the cell<br>
line give rise to ectodermal, mesodermal, and endodermal germ lines.<br>
<br>
[0024]      In one embodiment, a cell bank is disclosed including cryopreserved parthenotes,<br>
where the parthenotes are derived from parthenogenetically activated oocytes from one or<br>
more human donors. In a related aspect, the parthenotes have been cultivated under low O2<br>
tension until blastocyst formation.<br>
[0025]      In one embodiment, a cell bank is disclosed including cryopreserved autologous<br>
stem cells, where the stem cells are derived from parthenogenetically activated oocytes from<br>
one or more human donors.<br>
[0026]      In another embodiment, a method of treating a subject in need thereof, comprising<br>
administering a cellular composition comprising differentiated cells, wherein the<br>
differentiated cells are derived from a stem cell obtained from a parthenogenetically activated<br>
oocyte from a human donor. In one aspect, the differentiated cell is selected from the group<br>
consisting of a neuronal cell, cardiac cell, smooth muscle cell, striated muscle cell,<br>
endothelial cell, osteoblast, oligodendrocyte, hematopoietic cell, adipose cell, stromal cell,<br>
chondrocyte, astrocyte, dendritic cell, keratinocyte, pancreatic islet, lymphoid precursor cell,<br>
mast cell, mesodermal cell, and endodermal cell.<br>

consisting of Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, ALS, spinal cord<br>
defects or injuries, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, cystic fibrosis, liver disease,<br>
diabetes, heart disease, retinal disease (such as macular degeneration and retinitis<br>
pigmentosa), cartilage defects or injuries, burns, foot ulcers, vascular disease, urinary tract<br>
disease, AIDS, and cancer.<br>
[0028]      In one embodiment, a method of generating cloned human embryonic stem cells is<br>
disclosed, including removing a first pronuclei from a previously fertilized human oocyte,<br>
transferring a second pro-nuclei into the enucleated oocyte, where the second pro-nuclei is<br>
derived from a donor oocyte or an oocyte from the mother of the donor, or a<br>
parthenogenetically activated oocyte, where the pro-nuclei of the oocyte has been replaced by<br>
the nucleus of a donoT somatic cell prior to activation, and cultivating the resulting oocyte<br>
until blastocyst formation, where an inner cell mass from the blastocyst contains the<br>
embryonic stem cells.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
10047)      Before the present composition, methods, and culturing methodologies are<br>
described, it is to be understood that this invention is not limited to particular compositions,<br>
methods, and experimental conditions described, as such compositions, methods, and<br>
conditions may vary. It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for<br>
purposes of describing particular embodiments only, and is not intended to be limiting, since<br>
the scope of the present invention will be limited only in the appended claims.<br>
<br>
[0048]      As used in this specification and the appended claims, the singular forms "a", "an",<br>
and "the" include plural references unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for<br>
example, references to "the method" includes one or more methods, and/or steps of the type<br>
described herein which will become apparent to those persons skilled in the art upon reading<br>
this disclosure and so forth.<br>
[0049]      "Differentiation" refers to a change that occurs in cells to cause those cells to<br>
assume certain specialized functions and to lose the ability to change into certain other<br>
specialized functional units. Cells capable of differentiation may be any of totipotent,<br>
pluripotent or multipotent cells. Differentiation may be partial or complete with respect to<br>
mature adult cells.<br>
[0050]      Gynogenesis refers to the production of an embryo containing a discernible<br>
trophectoderm and inner cell mass that results upon activation of a cell, such as an oocyte, or<br>
other embryonic cell type, containing mammalian DNA of all female origin, preferably<br>
human female origin, e.g., human or non-human primate oocyte DNA. Such female<br>
mammalian DNA may be genetically modified, e.g., by insertion, deletion or substitution of<br>
at least one DNA sequence, or may be unmodified. For example, the DNA may be modified<br>
by the insertion or deletion of desired coding sequences, or sequences that promote or inhibit<br>
embryogenesis. Typically, such an embryo will be obtained by in vitro activation of an<br>
oocyte that contains DNA of all female origin. Gynogenesis is inclusive of parthenogenesis<br>
which is defined below. It also includes activation methods where the spermatozoal DNA<br>
does not contribute to the DNA in the activated oocyte.<br>
[0051]      In a related aspect, oocytes are obtained from superovulating subjects prepared for<br>
IVF. "Superovulation" techniques, such as treatment of a female subject with hormones,<br>
used in IVF are designed to stimulate the ovaries to produce several eggs (oocytes) rather<br>
than the usual single egg as in a natural cycle.<br>
[0052]      The medications required to boost egg production may include, but are not limited<br>
to the following: Lupron (gonadotropin releasing hormone-agonist), Orgalutran, Antagon or<br>
Cetrotide (gonadotropin releasing hormone-antagonist), Follistim, Bravelle or Gonal-F (FSH,<br>
follicle stimulating hormone), Repronex (combination of FSH and LH, luteinizing hormone),<br>
and Pregnyl or Novarel (hCG, human chorionic gonadotropin).<br>
<br>
[0053]      In a related aspect, collection of eggs can be performed under transvaginal<br>
ultrasound guidance. To accomplish this, a needle is inserted (e.g., under IV sedation)<br>
through the vaginal wall into the ovaries using ultrasound to locate each follicle. The<br>
follicular fluid is drawn up into a test tube to obtain the eggs.<br>
[0054]      "Parthenogenesis" ("parthenogenically activated" and"parthenogenetically<br>
activated" is used interchangeably) the process by which activation of the oocyte occurs in<br>
the absence of sperm penetration, and refers to the development of an early stage embryo<br>
comprising trophectoderm and inner cell mass that is obtained by activation of an oocyte or<br>
embryonic cell, e.g., blastomere, comprising DNA of all female origin. In a related aspect, a<br>
"parthenote" refers to the resulting cell obtained by such activation. In another related aspect,<br>
"blastocyst" refers to a cleavage stage of a fertilized or activated oocyte comprising a hollow<br>
ball of cells made of outer trophoblast cells and an inner cell mass (ICM). In a further related<br>
aspect, "blastocyst formation" refers to the process, after oocyte fertilization or activation,<br>
where the oocyte is subsequently cultured in media for a time to enable it to develop into a<br>
hollow ball of cells made of outer trophoblast cells and ICM (e.g., 5 to 6 days).<br>
[0055]      In one embodiment, the process of creating cloned human embryonic stem cell line<br>
by parthenogenetically activated oocytes is disclosed. While pathogenesis is not an<br>
uncommon form of reproduction in nature, mammals are not known to be capable of this<br>
form of reproduction. However, a 10% rate of spontaneous parthenogenesis can be found in<br>
oocytes from females of the inbred mouse strain LT/Sv (Ozil and Huneau., Development<br>
(2001) 128:917-928; Vrana et al., Proc Natl Acad SciUSA (2003) 100(Suppl 1):11911-<br>
11916; Berkowitz and Goldstein, New Eng J Med (1996) 335(23).1740-1748). Oocytes from<br>
placental mammals can be induced to undergo parthenogenesis in vitro; however, embryonic<br>
development is unsuccessful.<br>
[0056]      Following parthenogenic activation of mammalian oocytes and transfer of the<br>
activated oocyte into a surrogate mother, there is limited embryonic survival: ten days in<br>
mice; 21 days in sheep; 29 days in pigs; and 11.5 days in rabbits (Rure-bayashi et al.,<br>
Theriogenology (2000) 53:1105-1119; Hagemann et al., Mol Reprod Dev (1998) 50:154-162;<br>
Surani and Barton, Science (1983) 222:1034-1036). The reason for this arrested development<br>
is likely due to genetic imprinting. It has been shown that maternal and paternal genomes are<br>
epigentically different and that both sets are required for successful embryonic development<br>
(Surani, Cell (1998) 93:309-312; Sasaki et al., (1992) 6:1843-1856). In parthenotes, all of the<br>
<br>
genetic material should be of maternal origin, a therefore should lack paternal imprinting.<br>
Paternal imprinting is thought to be responsible for extra-embryo tissue development, thus<br>
the development of trophoblastic tissue following fertilization of an enucleated oocyte<br>
(Stevens, Nature (1978) 276:266-267). In animals, therefore, enucleated zygotes may be<br>
useful for nucleaT transfer with subsequent parthenogenic activation.<br>
[0057]      Mammalian parthenotes undergo only limited development with eventual death of<br>
the embryo. In Macac fascicularis, only 14 percent of oocytes in stage II rnetaphase<br>
following in vitro Parthenogenetic activation developed to the blastocyst stage following 8<br>
days of culture (Monk, Genes Dev (1988) 2:921-925). Similarly, 12 percent of human<br>
oocytes that were parthenogenetically activated in vitro following nuclear transfer developed<br>
to the blastocyst state (Monk, 1988). In both cases, one stem cell line was created.<br>
(0058]      Embryos formed in spontaneously activated parthenotes in virgin females of the<br>
LT/Sv inbred mouse strain die within a few days. When nuclear transfer is performed from<br>
cells comprising the inner cell mass (ICM) of these embryos into fertilized enucleated<br>
C57BL/6J mouse oocytes, cloned mice with the LT/Sv genome are obtained (Kaufman et al.,<br>
Nature (1977) 265:53-55). Thus, the use of a fertilized oocyte allows for full-term<br>
development of a parthenote. In one aspect, a fertilized enucleated human oocyte can be used<br>
to support development of a parthenogenetic embryo containing a donor's nuclei until the<br>
blastocyst stage.<br>
[0059]      In one embodiment, the pronuclei of a donor's oocyte or from the oocyte of the<br>
mother of a donoT, following parthenogenetic activation, can be transferred into a fertilized<br>
human oocyte from which the male and female pronuclei have been extracted.<br>
[0060]      In another embodiment, a two stage process is disclosed foT generating human<br>
stem cells including transferring the nucleus of a donor's somatic cell into a donor oocyte,<br>
where the oocyte is subsequently activated by parthenogenesis and transferring the pronuclei<br>
of the activated oocyte into a fertilized oocyte, where the male and female pronuclei have<br>
been extracted.<br>
[0061]      In another embodiment, the nucleus from a donor's somatic cell can be transferred<br>
into a fertilized enucleated human oocyte with subsequent parthenogenetic activation. The<br>
three embodiments above are illustrated by the following flow diagrams:<br>

[0062]      "Pluripotent cell" refers to a cell derived from an embryo produced by activation of<br>
a cell containing DN A of all female or male origin that can be maintained in vitro for<br>
prolonged, theoretically indefinite period of time in an undifferentiated state, that can give<br>
rise to different differentiated tissue types, i.e., ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. The<br>
pluripotent state of the cells is preferably maintained by culturing inner cell mass or cells<br>
derived from the inner cell mass of an embryo produced by androgenetic or gynogenetic<br>
methods under appropriate conditions, for example, by culturing on a fibroblast feeder layer<br>
or another feeder layer or culture that includes leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). The<br>
pluripotent state of such cultured cells can be confirmed by various methods, e.g., (i)<br>
confirming the expression of markers characteristic of pluripotent cells; (ii) production of<br>
chimeric animals that contain cells that express the genotype of the pluripotent cells; (iii)<br>
injection of cells into animals, e.g., SCID mice, with the production of different differentiated<br>
cell types in vivo; and (iv) observation of the differentiation of the cells (e.g., when cultured<br>
in the absence of feedeT layer or LIF) into embryoid bodies and other differentiated cell types<br>
in vitro.<br>
[0063]      "Diploid cell" refers to a cell, e.g., an oocyte or blastomere, having a diploid DNA<br>
content of all male or female origin.<br>
<br>
[0064]      "Haploid cell" refers to a cell, e.g., an oocyte or blastomere, having a haploid DNA<br>
content, where the haploid DNA is of all male or female origin.<br>
[0065]      Activation refers to a process where a fertilized or unfertilized oocyte, for example,<br>
but not limited to, in metaphase II of meiosis, undergoes a process typically including<br>
separation of the chromatid pairs, extrusion'of the second polar body, resulting in an oocyte<br>
having a haploid number of chromosomes, each with one chromatid. Activation includes<br>
methods whereby a cell containing DNA of all male or female origin is induced to develop<br>
into an embryo that has a discernible inner cell mass and trophectoderm, which is useful for<br>
producing pluripotent cells but which is itself is likely to be incapable of developing into a<br>
viable offspring. Activation may be carried out, for example, under one of the following<br>
conditions: (1) conditions that do not cause second polar body extrusion; (ii) conditions that<br>
cause polar body extrusion but where the polar body extrusion is inhibited; or (iii) conditions<br>
that inhibit first cell division of the haploid oocyte.<br>
[0066]      "Metaphase II" refers to a stage of cell development wheie the DNA content of a<br>
cell consists of a haploid number of chromosomes with each chromosome represented by two<br>
chromatids.<br>
[0067]      In one embodiment, metaphase II oocytes are activated by incubating oocytes<br>
under various O2 tension gas environments. In a related aspect, the low O2 tension gas<br>
environment is created by a gas mixture comprising an O2 concentration of about 2%, 3%,<br>
4%, or 5%. In a further related aspect, the gas mixture comprises about 5% CO2. Further,<br>
the gas mixture comprises about 90% N2, 91% N2, or 93% N2. This gas mixture is to be<br>
distinguished from 5% CO2 air, which is approximately about 5% CO2,20% O2, and 75% N2.<br>
J0068]      "O2 tension" refers to the partial pressure (pressure exerted by a single component<br>
of a gas mixture) of oxygen in a fluid (i.e., liquid or gas). Low tension is when the partial<br>
pressure of oxygen (PO2) is low and high tension is when the pO2 is high.<br>
[0069]      "Defined-medium conditions" refer to environments for culturing cells where the<br>
concentration of components therein required for optimal growth are detailed. For example,<br>
depending on the use of the cells (e.g., therapeutic applications), removing cells from<br>
conditions that contain xenogenic proteins is important; i.e., the culture conditions are<br>
animal-free conditions or free of non-human animal proteins. In a related aspect, "in vitro<br>
<br>
fertilization (TVF) media" refers to a nutrient system which contains chemically defined<br>
substances on or in which fertilized oocytes can be grown.<br>
[0070]      "Extracellular matrix (ECM) substrates" refer to a surface beneath cells which<br>
supports optimum growth. For example, such ECM substrates include, but are not limited to,<br>
Matrigel, laminin, gelatin, and fibronectin substrates. In a related aspect, such substrates may<br>
comprise collagen IV, entactin, heparin sulfate proteoglycan, to include various growth<br>
factors (e.g., bFGF, epidermal growth factor, insulin-like growth factor-1, platelet derived<br>
growth factor, nerve growth factor, and TGF-P-1).<br>
[0071]      "Embryo" refers to an embryo that results upon activation of a cell, e.g., oocyte or<br>
other embryonic cells containing DNA of all male or female origin, which optionally may be<br>
modified, that comprises a discernible trophectoderm and inner cell mass, which cannot give<br>
rise to a viable offspring and where the DNA is of all male or female origin. The inner cell<br>
mass or cells contained therein are useful for the production of pluripotent cells as defined<br>
previously.<br>
[0072]      "Inner cell mass (ICM)" refers to the inner portion of an embryo which gives rise<br>
to fetal tissues. Herein, these cells are used to provide a continuous source of pluripotent cells<br>
in vitro.  Further, the ICM includes the inner portion of the embryo that results from<br>
androgenesis or gynogenesis, i.e., embryos that result upon activation of cells containing<br>
DNA of all male or female origin. Such DNA, for example, will be human DNA, e.g., human<br>
oocyte or spermatozoal DNA, which may or may not have been genetically modified.<br>
[0073]      "Trophectoderm" refers to another portion of early stage embryo which gives rise<br>
to placental tissues, including that tissue of an embryo that results from androgenesis or<br>
gynogenesis, i.e., embryos that result from activation of cells that contain DNA of all male or<br>
female origin, e.g., human ovarian or spermatozoan.<br>
[0074]      "Differentiated cell" refers to a non-embryonic cell that possesses a particular<br>
differentiated, i.e., non-embryonic, state. The three earliest differentiated cell types are<br>
endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm.<br>
[0075]      "Substantially identical" refers to a quality of sameness regarding a particular<br>
characteristic that is so close as to be essentially the same within the ability to measure<br>
difference (e.g., by HLA typing, SNP analysis, and the like).<br>
<br>
[0076]      "Histocompatible" refers to the extent to which an organism will tolerate a graft of<br>
a foreign tissue.<br>
[0077]      "Genomic imprinting" refers to the mechanism by which a number of genes<br>
throughout the genome are monoallelically expressed according to their parental origin.<br>
[0078]      "Homoplasmy," including grammatical variations thereof, refers to the presence of<br>
the same type of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) within a cell or individual.<br>
[0079]      "Heteroplasmy," including grammatical variations thereof, refers to the presence of<br>
a mixture of more than one type of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) within a cell or individual.<br>
[0080]      "Uniparental" refers to one or more cells or individuals from which another arises<br>
and to which it remains subsidiary.<br>
[0081]      "Mechanically isolating" refers to the process of separating cell aggregates by<br>
physical forces. For example, such a process would exclude the use of enzymes (or other cell<br>
cleavage products) which might contain non-human materials.<br>
[0082]      In the native environment, immature oocytes (eggs) from the ovary undergo a<br>
process of maturation which results in the progression through meiosis to metaphase II of<br>
meiosis. The oocytes then arrest at metaphase If. In metaphase II, the DNA content of the<br>
cell consists of a haploid number of chromosomes, each represented by two chromatids.<br>
[0083]      Such oocytes may be maintained indefinitely by cryopreserving by, for example,<br>
but not limited to, microinjection with a sugar.<br>
[0084]      In one embodiment, a method for producing human stem cells from a<br>
cryopreserved oocyte or parthenote is provided, including microinjecting into the cytoplasm<br>
of the oocyte or parthenote a cryopreservation agent, freezing the oocyte or parthenote to a<br>
cryogenic temperature to cause it to enteT a dormant state, storing the oocyte or parthenote in<br>
the dormant state, thawing the oocyte OT parthenote, parthenogenically activating the oocyte<br>
under high O2 tension in the presence or an ionophore followed by contacting the oocyte with<br>
a serine—threonine kinase inhibitor under low O2 tension, culturing the activated oocyte or<br>
parthenote until blastocyst formation, isolating an inner cell mass (ICM) from the blastocyst,<br>
and culturing the cells of the ICM on a layer of human feeder cells, where culturing the ICM<br>
cells is carried out under high O2 tension.<br>
<br>
[0085]      In one aspect, oocytes obtained as described are transferred to modified, isotonic<br>
IVF covered with embryo-tested mineral oil (Sigma), or any other suitable medium. If<br>
desired, the oocytes may be incubated with an extracellular sugar at the same concentration<br>
as the amount planned for microinjection. For example, to inject 0.1 M sugar, oocytes may<br>
be equilibrated in DMEM/F-12 with 0.1 M sugar. In one aspect, the cryopreservation agent<br>
comprises a lower Na+ concentration than standard DMEM (i.e., Na+ low media). In a related<br>
aspect, the cryopreservation agent comprises a higher K+ concentration than standard DMEM<br>
(i.e., K high). In a further related aspect, the cryopreservation agent comprises both a lower<br>
Na+ and higher K+ concentration than standard DMEM (i.e., Na+ low/ K+ high media). In one<br>
aspect, the cryopreservation agent comprises an organic buffer, including but not limited to,<br>
HEPES. In another aspect, the cryopreservation agent comprises moieties that inhibit<br>
apoptotic protein (e.g., capases).<br>
[0086]      Alternatively, the oocytes may be optionally equilibrated with any other<br>
substantially non-permeable solute, such a NaCl, to decrease their cell volume prior to<br>
microinjection. This initial decrease in cell volume may result in a smaller final volume of<br>
the microinjected oocytes compared to oocytes not incubated in a hypertonic media prior to<br>
microinjection. This smaller final volume may minimize any potential adverse effect from<br>
the swelling of the oocytes. This general procedure for the preparation of cells for<br>
microinjection may also be used for other cell types (e.g., activated oocytes, hES cells, and<br>
the like).<br>
[0087]      The oocytes are then microinjected with a cryopreservation agent. Microinjection<br>
equipment and procedures are well characterized in the art and microinjection equipment<br>
known for use in injecting small molecules into cells may be used with the invention. In an<br>
exemplary microinjection step, oocytes can be microinjected at a pressure of 10 psi for 30<br>
milliseconds. Another example of a standard microinjection technique is the method<br>
described by Nakayama and Yanagimachi (Nature Biotech. 16:639-642, 1998).<br>
[0088]      A cryopreservation agent useful in this process includes any chemical that has<br>
cryo-protective properties and is ordinarily non-permeable. In particular, the<br>
cryopreservation agent can include sugars either alone or mixed together v/ith other<br>
traditional cryopreservation agents. Carbohydrate sugars such as trehalose, sucrose, fructose,<br>
and raffinose, may be microinjected to concentrations less than or equal to about 1.0 M, and<br>
more preferably, less than or equal to about 0.4 M.   In one aspect, the concentration is<br>
<br>
between 0.05 and 0.20 M, inclusive. Additionally, an extracellular sugar or traditional<br>
cryopreservation agent may be added prior to storage.  If the cells were incubated in a<br>
hypertonic solution prior to microinjection, the substantially non-permeable solute may be<br>
allowed to remain in the media after microinjection or may be removed from the media by<br>
washing the cells with media containing a lower concentration, or none, of this solute.<br>
[0089]      Certain sugars or polysaccharides which ordinarily do not permeate cell<br>
membranes because they are too large to pass through the membrane have superior<br>
physiochemical and biological properties for cryopreservation purposes. While these sugars<br>
oTdinarily do not permeate cell membranes on their own, using the method as described, these<br>
ordinarily non-permeating sugars may be microinjected intracellularly to result in a beneficial<br>
effect.<br>
[0090]      Non-permeating sugars having a stabilizing or preserving effect on cells that ate<br>
especially useful as the cryopreservation agent in the present method include sucrose,<br>
trehalose, fructose, dextran, and raffinose. Among these sugars, trehalose, a non-reducing<br>
disaccharide of glucose, has been shown to be exceptionally effective in stabilizing cell<br>
structures at low concentrations. The addition of extracellular glycoVipids or glycoproteins<br>
may also stabilize the cell membrane.<br>
[0091]      Following the microinjection of the cryopreservation agent, the cells are prepared<br>
for storage. A variety of methods for freezing and/or drying may be employed to prepare the<br>
cells for storage. In particular, three approaches are described herein: vacuum or air drying,<br>
freeze drying, and freeze-thaw protocols. Drying processes have the advantage that the<br>
stabilized biological material may be transported and stored at ambient temperatures.<br>
[0092] Typically, oocytes loaded with 1 to 2M DMSO are cooled at a very slow cooling<br>
rate (0.3 to 0.5°C/min) to an intermediate temperature (-60°C. to -80°C.) before plunging in<br>
liquid nitrogen for storage. The sample can then be stored at this temperature.<br>
[0093]      The suspended material can then be stored at cryopreservation temperatures, for<br>
example, by leaving the vials in liquid nitrogen (LN2), for the desired amount of time.<br>
[0094]      Protocols for vacuum or air drying and for freeze drying proteins are well<br>
characterized in the art (Franks et al., "Materials Science and the Production of Shelf-Stable<br>
Biologicals," BioPharm, October 1991, p. 39; Shalaev et al., "Changes in the Physical State<br>
of Model Mixtures during Freezing and Drying: Impact on Product Quality," Cryobiol. 33,<br>
<br>
14-26 (1996)) and such protocols may be used to prepare cell suspensions for storage with<br>
the method as described. In addition to air drying, other convective drying methods that may<br>
be used to remove water from cell suspensions include the convective flow of nitrogen or<br>
other gases.<br>
[0095}      An exemplary evaporative vacuum drying protocol useful with the method of the<br>
invention may include placing 20ul each into wells on 12 well plates and vacuum drying for<br>
2 hours at ambient temperature. Of course, other drying methods could be used, including<br>
drying the cells in vials. Cells prepared in this manner may be stored dry, and rehydrated by<br>
diluting in DMEM or any other suitable media.<br>
[0096]      A method of the invention using freeze drying to prepare the cells for storage<br>
begins with freezing the cell suspension. While methods of freezing known in the art may be<br>
employed, the simple plunge freezing method described herein for the freeze-thaw method<br>
may also be used for the freezing step in the freeze drying protocol.<br>
[0097]      After freezing, a two stage drying process may be employed. In the first stage,<br>
energy of sublimation is added to vaporize frozen water. Secondary drying is performed after<br>
the pure crystalline ice in the sample has been sublimated. Freeze dried cells can be stored<br>
and hydrated in the same manner as described above for vacuum drying. Viable cells may<br>
then be recovered.<br>
[0098]      After the recovery of cells from a frozen or dried state, any external<br>
cryopreservation agent may be optionally removed from the culture media. For example, the<br>
media may be diluted by the addition of the corresponding media with a lower concentration<br>
of cryopreservation agent. For example, the recovered cells may be incubated for<br>
approximately five minutes in media containing a lower concentration of sugar than that used<br>
for cell storage. For this incubation, the media may contain the same sugar that was used as<br>
the cryopreservation agent; a different cryopreservation agent, such as galactose; or any other<br>
substantially non-permeable solute. To minimize any osmotic shock induced by the decrease<br>
in the osmolarity of the media, the concentration of the extracellular cryopreservation agent<br>
may be slowly decreased by performing this dilution step multiple times, each time with a<br>
lower concentration of cryopreservation agent. These dilution steps may be repeated until<br>
there is no extracellular cryopreservation agent present or until the concentration of<br>
cryopreservation agent or the osmolarity of the media is reduced to a desired level.<br>
<br>
[0099]      The parthenogenetically activated oocytes, blastocysts, ICM, and autologous stem<br>
cells can be stored or "banked" in a manner mat allows the cells to be revived as needed in<br>
the future. An aliquot of the parthenogenetically activated oocytes and autologous stem cells<br>
can be removed at any time, to be grown into cultures of many undifferentiated cells and then<br>
differentiated into a particular cell type or tissue type, and may then be used to treat a disease<br>
or to replace malfunctioning tissues in a subject. Since the cells are parthenogenetically<br>
derived from the donor, the cells can be stored so that an individual or close relative can have<br>
access to cells for an extended period of time.<br>
[0100]      In one embodiment, a cell bank is provided for storing parthenogenetically<br>
activated oocytes, blastocysts, ICM, and/or autologous stem cell samples. In another<br>
embodiment, methods for administering such a cell bank are provided. U.S. Published Patent<br>
Application No. 20030215942, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety,<br>
provides an example of a stem cell bank system.<br>
[0101]     Using methods such as those described above, the isolation and in vitro<br>
propagation of parthenogenetically activated oocytes, blastocysts, ICM, and autologous stem<br>
cell samples and their cryopreservation facilitates the establishment of a "bank" of<br>
transplantable human stem cells. Because it is possible to store smaller aliquots of cells, the<br>
banking procedure could take up a relatively small space. Therefore, the cells of many<br>
individuals could be stored or "banked" on a short term or long term basis, with relatively<br>
little expense.<br>
[0102]      In one embodiment, a portion of the sample is made available for testing, either<br>
before or after processing and storage.<br>
[0103]      This invention also provides methods of recording or indexing the<br>
parthenogenetically activated oocyte, blastocyst, ICM, and/or autologous stem cell samples<br>
so that when a sample needs to be located, it can be easily retrieved. Any indexing and<br>
retrieval system can be used to fulfill this purpose. Any suitable type of storage system can<br>
be used so that the parthenogenetically activated oocytes, blastocysts, ICM, and/or<br>
autologous stem cells can be stored. The samples can be designed to store individual<br>
samples, or can be designed to store hundreds, thousands, and even millions of different cell<br>
samples.<br>
<br>
[0104]      The stored parthenogenetically activated oocyte, blastocyst, ICM, and/or   •<br>
autologous stem cell samples can be indexed for reliable and accurate retrieval. For example,<br>
each sample can be marked with alphanumeric codes, bar codes, or any other method or<br>
combinations thereof. There may also be an accessible and readable listing of information<br>
enabling identification of each parthenogenetically activated oocyte, blastocyst, ICM, and/or<br>
autologous stem cell sample and its location in the bank and enabling identification of the<br>
source and/or type the cell sample, which is outside of the bank. This indexing system can be<br>
managed in any way known in the art, e.g., manually or non-manually, e.g. a computer and<br>
conventional software can be used.<br>
[0105]      In one embodiment, the cell samples are organized using an indexing system so<br>
that the sample will be available for the donor's use whenever needed. In other embodiments,<br>
the cell samples can be utilized by individuals related to the original donor. Once recorded<br>
into the indexing system, the cell sample can be made available for matching purposes, e.g., a<br>
matching program will identify an individual with matching type information and the<br>
individual will have the option of being provided the matching sample.<br>
[0106]      The storage banking system can comprise a system for storing a plurality of<br>
records associated with a plurality of individuals and a plurality of cell samples. Each record<br>
may contain type information, genotypic information or phenotypic information associated<br>
with the cell samples or specific individuals. In one embodiment, the system will include a<br>
cross-match table that matches types of the samples with types of individuals who wish to<br>
receive a sample.<br>
[0107]      In one embodiment, the database system stores information for each<br>
parthenogenetically activated oocyte, blastocyst, ICM, and/or autologous stem cell sample in<br>
the bank. Certain information is stored in association with each sample. The information may<br>
be associated with a particular donor, for example, an identification of the donor and the<br>
donor's medical history. For example, each sample may be HLA typed and the HI A type<br>
information may he stored in association with each sample. The information stored may also<br>
be availability information. The information stored with each sample is searchable and<br>
identifies the sample in such a way that it can be located and supplied to the client<br>
immediately.<br>
[0108]      Accordingly, embodiments of the invention utilize computer-based systems that<br>
contain information such as the donor, date of submission, type of cells submitted, types of<br>
cell surface markers present, genetic information relating to the donor, or other pertinent<br>
information, and storage details such as maintenance records and the location of the stored<br>
samples, and other useful information.<br>
10109]      The term "a computer-based system" refers to the hardware, software, and any<br>
database used to store, search, and retrieve information about the stored cells. The computer-<br>
based system preferably includes the storage media described above, and a processor for<br>
accessing and manipulating the data. The hardware of the computer-based systems of this<br>
embodiment comprises a central processing unit (CPU) and a database. A skilled artisan can<br>
readily appreciate that any one of the currently available computer-based systems are<br>
suitable.<br>
[0110]      In one embodiment, the computer system includes a processor connected to a bus<br>
that is connected to a main memory (preferably implemented as RAM) and a variety of<br>
secondary storage devices, such as a hard drive and removable medium storage device. The<br>
removable medium storage device can represent, for example, a floppy disk drive, a DVD<br>
drive, an optical disk drive, a compact disk drive, a magnetic tape drive, etc. A removable<br>
storage medium, such as a floppy disk, a compact disk, a magnetic tape, etc. containing<br>
control logic and/or data recorded therein can be inserted into the removable storage device.<br>
The computer system includes appropriate software for reading the control logic and/or the<br>
data from the removable medium storage device once inserted in the removable medium<br>
storage device. Information relating to the parthenogenetically activated oocyte, blastocyst,<br>
ICM, and/or autologous stem cell can be stored in a well known manner in the main memory,<br>
any of the secondary storage devices, and/or a removable storage medium, Software for<br>
accessing and processing these data (such as search tools, compare tools, etc.) reside in main<br>
memory during execution.<br>
[0111]      As used herein, "a database" refers to memory that can store any useful<br>
information relating to the parthenogenetically activated oocyte and/or autologous stem cell<br>
collections and the donors.<br>
[0112]      The data relating to the stored parthenogenetically activated oocyte, blastocyst,<br>
ICM, and/or autologous stem cell can be stored and manipulated in a variety of data<br>
processor programs in a variety of formats. For example, the data can be stored as text in a<br>
word processing file, such as Microsoft WORD or WORDPERFECT, an ASCII file, an html<br>
<br>
file, or a pdf file in a variety of database programs familiar to those of skill in the art, such as<br>
DB2, SYBASE, or ORACLE.<br>
{0113)      A "search program" refers to one or more programs that are implemented on the<br>
computer-based system to search for details or compare information relating to the<br>
cryopreserved samples within a database. A "retrieval program" refers to one or more<br>
programs that can be implemented on the computer-based system to identify parameters of<br>
interest in the database. For example, a retrieval program can be used to find samples that fit<br>
a particular profile, samples having specific markers or DNA sequences, or to find the<br>
location of samples corresponding to particular individuals.<br>
[0114]     There is no upper limit on the number of cell samples that can be stored in one cell<br>
bank. In one embodiment, hundreds of products from different individuals will be stored at<br>
one bank or storage facility. In another embodiment, up to millions of products may be stored<br>
in one storage facility. A single storage facility may be used to store parthenogenetically<br>
activated oocyte and/or autologous stem cell samples, or multiple storage facilities may be<br>
used.<br>
[0115]      In some embodiments of the present invention, the storage facility may have a<br>
means for any method of organizing and indexing the stored cell samples, such as, for<br>
example, automated robotic retrieval mechanisms and cell sample manipulation mechanisms.<br>
The facility may include micromanipulation devices for processing cell samples. Known<br>
conventional technologies can be used for efficient storage and retrieval of the cell samples.<br>
Exemplary technologies include but are not limited to Machine Vision, Robotics, Automated<br>
Guided Vehicle System,. Automated Storage and Retrieval Systems, Computer Integrated<br>
Manufacturing, Computer Aided Process Planning, Statistical Process Control, and the like.<br>
[0116]      The type information or other information associated with the individual in need of<br>
a sample may be recorded into a system that can be used to identify an appropriate matching<br>
product, such as, for example, a database system, an indexing system, and the like. Once<br>
recorded in the system, a match can be made between the type of the individual and a donor<br>
cell sample. In preferred embodiments, the donor sample is from tire same individual as the<br>
individual in need of the sample. However, similar but not identical donor/recipient matches<br>
can also be used. The matching sample is available for the individual possessing the<br>
matching type identifier. In one embodiment of this invention, the individual's identification<br>
information is stored in connection with the cell sample. In some embodiments, the matching<br>
<br>
process occurs around the time of harvesting the sample, or can occur at any time during<br>
processing, storage, or  when a need arises. Accordingly, in some embodiments of the<br>
invention, the matching process occurs before the individual is in actual need of the cell<br>
sample.<br>
[0117]      When the parthenogenetically activated oocyte, blastocyst, ICM, and/or autologous<br>
stem cell sample is needed by an individual, it may be retrieved and made available for<br>
research, transplantation or other purposes within minutes, if desired. The sample may also be<br>
further processed to prepare it for transplantation or other needs.<br>
[0118]      Normally, the oocyte is ovulated at this stage and fertilized by the sperm. The<br>
sperm initiates the completion of meiosis in a process called activation. During activation,<br>
the pairs of chromatids separate, the second polar body is extruded, and the oocyte retains a<br>
haploid number of chromosomes, each with one chromatid. The sperm contributes the other<br>
haploid complement of chromosomes to make a full diploid cell with single chromatids. The<br>
chromosomes then progress through DNA synthesis during the first cell cycle. These cells<br>
then develop into embryos.<br>
[0119]      By contrast, embryos described herein are developed by artificial activation of<br>
cells, typically mammalian oocytes or blastomeres containing DNA of all male or female<br>
origin. As discussed in the background of the invention, many methods have been reported in<br>
the literature for artificial activation of unfertilized oocytes. Such methods include physical<br>
methods, e.g., mechanical methods such as pricking, manipulation or oocytes in culture,<br>
thermal methods such as cooling and heating, repeated electric pulses, enzymatic treatments,<br>
such as trypsin, pronase, hyaluronidase, osmotic treatments, ionic treatments such as with<br>
divalent cations and calcium ionophores, such as ionomycin and A23187, the use of<br>
anesthetics such as ether, ethanol, tetracaine, lignocaine, procaine, phenothiazine,<br>
tranquilizers such as thioridazine, trifluoperazine, fluphenazine, chlorpromazine, the use of<br>
protein synthesis inhibitors such as cycloheximide, puromycin, the use of phosphorylation<br>
inhibitors, e.g., protein kinase inhibitors such as staurosporine, 2-aminopurine, sphingosine,<br>
and DMAP, combinations thereof, as well as other methods.<br>
[0120]      Such activation methods are well known in the art and are discussed U.S. Pat. No.<br>
5,945,577, incorporated herein by reference.<br>
<br>
10121]     In one embodiment, a human cell in metaphase II, typically an oocyte or<br>
blastomere comprising DNA of all male or female origin, is artificially activated for effecting<br>
artificial activation of oocytes.<br>
[0122]      In a related aspect, the activated cell, e.g., oocyte, which is diploid, is allowed to<br>
develop into an embryo that comprises a trophectoderm and an inner cell mass. This can be<br>
effected using known methods and culture media that facilitate blastocyst development.<br>
[0123]      After the gynogenetic embryos have been cultured to produce a discemable<br>
trophectoderm and inner cell mass, the cells of the inner cell mass are then used to produce<br>
the desired pluripotent cell lines. This can be accomplished by transferring cells derived<br>
from the inner cell mass or the entire inner cell mass onto a culture that inhibits<br>
differentiation. This can be effected by transferring the inner cell mass cells onto a feeder<br>
layer that inhibits differentiation, e.g., fibroblasts or epithelial cells, such as fibroblasts<br>
derived from postnatal human tissues, etc., or other cells that produce LIF. Other<br>
factors/components may be employed to provide appropriate culture conditions for<br>
maintaining cells in the undifferentiated state including, but not limited to, addition of<br>
conditioned media (Amit et al., Developmental Biol (2000) 227:271-278), bFGF and TGF-ßl<br>
(with or without LIF) (Amit et al., Biol Reprod (2004) 70:837-845), factors which activate<br>
the gpl30/STAT3 pathway (Hoffman and Carpenter, Nature Biotech (2005) 23(6):699-708),<br>
factors which activate the PDK/Akt, PKB pathway (Kim et al., FEBS Lett (2005) 579:534-<br>
540), factors that are members of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) super family<br>
(Hoffman and Carpenter (2005), supra), and factors which activate the canonical/p-catenin<br>
Wnt signaling pathway (e.g., GSK-3-specific inhibitor; Sato et al„ Nat Med (2004) 10:55-<br>
63). In a related aspect, such factors may comprise culture conditions that include feeder<br>
cells and/or ECM substrates (Hoffman and Carpenter (2005), supra).<br>
[0124]      In one aspect, the inneT cell mass cells are cultured on human postnatal foreskin or<br>
dermal fibroblast cells or other cells which produce leukemia inhibitory factor, or in the<br>
presence of leukemia inhibitory factor. In a related aspect, feeder cells are inactivated prior<br>
to seeding with the ICM. For example, the feeder cells can be mitotically inactivated using<br>
an antibiotic. In a related aspect, the antibiotic can be, but is not limited to, mitomycin C.<br>
[0125]      Culturing will be effected under conditions that maintain the cells in an<br>
undifferentiated, pluripotent state, for prolonged periods, theoretically indefinitely. In one<br>
embodiment, oocytes are parthenogenically activated with calcium ionophores under high O2<br>
<br>
tension followed by contacting the oocytes with a serine-threonine kinase inhibitor under low<br>
O2 tension. The resulting ICM from the parthenogenically activated oocytes is cultured under<br>
high O2 tension, where the cells, for example, are maintained using a gas mixture comprising<br>
20% O2. In one aspect, culturable refers to being capable of, or fit for, being cultivated. In a<br>
related aspect, ICM isolation is carried out mechanically after four days of blastocyst<br>
cultivation, where the cultivation is carried out on feeder cells. Such cultivation, for example,<br>
eliminates the need to use materials derived from animal sources, as would be the case for<br>
immunosurgery.<br>
[0126]      In a related aspect, culture media for the ICM is supplemented with non-animal<br>
sera, including but not limited to, human umbilical cord serum, where the serum is present in<br>
defined media (e.g., IVF, available from MediCuIt A/S, Denmark; Vitrolife, Sweden; or<br>
Zander IVF, Inc., Vero Beach, FL). In another aspect, the media and processes as provided<br>
are free of animal products. In a related aspect, animal products are those products, including<br>
serum, interferons, chemokines, cytokines, hormones, and growth factors, that are from non-<br>
human sources.<br>
[0127]      The pluripotent state of the cells produced by the present invention can be<br>
confirmed by various methods. For example, the cells can be tested for the presence or<br>
absence of characteristic ES cell markers. In the case of human ES cells, examples of such<br>
markers are identified supra, and include SSEA-4, SSEA-3, TRA-1-60, TRA-1-81 and OCT<br>
4, and are known in the art.<br>
[0128]      Also, pluripotency can be confirmed by injecting the cells into a suitable animal,<br>
e.g., a SCID mouse, and observing the production of differentiated cells and tissues. Still<br>
another method of confirming pluripotency is using the subject pluripotent cells to generate<br>
chimeric animals and observing the contribution of the introduced cells to different cell types.<br>
Methods for producing chimeric animals are well known in the art and are described in U.S.<br>
Pat. No. 6,642,433, incorporated by reference herein.<br>
[0129]      Yet another method of confirming pluripotency is to observe ES cell differentiation<br>
into embryoid bodies and other differentiated cell types when cultured under conditions that<br>
favor differentiation (e.g., removal of fibroblast feeder layers). This method has been utilized<br>
and it has been confirmed that the subject pluripotent cells give rise to embryoid bodies and<br>
different differentiated cell types in tissue culture.<br>
<br>
[0130]      The resultant pluripotent cells and cell lines, preferably human pluripotent cells<br>
and cell lines, which are derived from DNA of entirely female original, have numerous<br>
therapeutic and diagnostic applications. Such pluripotent cells may be used for cell<br>
transplantation therapies or gene therapy (if genetically modified) in the treatment of<br>
numerous disease conditions.<br>
10131]      In this regard, it is known that mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells are capable of<br>
differentiating into almost any cell type. Therefore, human pluripotent (ES) cells produced<br>
according to the invention should possess similar differentiation capacity. The pluripotent<br>
cells according to the invention will be induced to differentiate to obtain the desired cell types<br>
according to known methods. For example, human ES cells produced according to the<br>
invention may be induced to differentiate into hematopoietic stem cells, muscle cells, cardiac<br>
muscle cells, liver cells, islet cells, retinal cells, cartilage cells, epithelial cells, urinary tract<br>
cells, etc., by culturing such cells in differentiation medium and under conditions which<br>
provide for cell differentiation. Medium and methods which result in the differentiation of<br>
ES cells are known in the art as are suitable culturing conditions.<br>
[0132]      For example, Palacios et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA, 92:7530-7537 (1995)<br>
teach the production of hematopoietic stem cells from an embryonic cell line by subjecting<br>
stem cells to an induction procedure comprising initially culturing aggregates of such cells in<br>
a suspension culture medium lacking retinoic acid followed by culturing in the same medium<br>
containing retinoic acid, followed by transferal of cell aggregates to a substrate which<br>
provides for cell attachment.<br>
[0133]      Moreover, Pedersen, J. Reprod. Fertil. Dev., 6:543-552 (1994) is a review article<br>
which references numerous articles disclosing methods for in vitro differentiation of<br>
embryonic stem cells to produce various differentiated cell types including hematopoietic<br>
cells, muscle, cardiac muscle, nerve cells, among others.<br>
[0134]      Further, Bain et al, Dev. Biol, 168:342-357 (1995) teach in vitro differentiation of<br>
embryonic stem cells to produce neural cells which possess neuronal properties. These<br>
references are exemplary of reported methods for obtaining differentiated cells from<br>
embryonic or stem cells. These references and in particular the disclosures therein relating to<br>
methods for differentiating embryonic stem cells are incorporated by reference in their<br>
entirety herein. Thus, using known methods and culture medium, one skilled in the art may<br>
culture the subject ES cells, including genetically engineered or transgenic ES cells, to obtain<br>
<br>
desired differentiated cell types, e.g., neural cells, muscle cells, hematopoietic cells, etc.<br>
Pluripotent cells produced by the methods described herein may be used to obtain any desired<br>
differentiated cell type. Therapeutic usages of differentiated human cells are unparalleled.<br>
For example, human hematopoietic stem cells may be used in medical treatments requiring<br>
bone marrow transplantation. Such procedures are used to treat many diseases, e.g., late<br>
stage cancers such as ovarian cancer and leukemia, as well as diseases that compromise the<br>
immune system, such as AIDS. Hematopoietic stem cells can be obtained, e.g., by<br>
incorporating male or female DNA derived from a male or female cancer or AIDS patient<br>
with an enucleated oocyte, obtaining pluripotent cells as described above, Eind culturing such<br>
cells under conditions which favor differentiation, until hematopoietic stem cells are<br>
obtained. Such hematopoietic cells may be used in the treatment of diseases including cancer<br>
and AIDS.<br>
[0135]      Alternatively, the subject pluripotent cells may be used to treat a patient with a<br>
neurological disorder by culturing such cells under differentiation conditions that produce<br>
neural cell lines. Specific diseases treatable by transplantation of such human neural cells<br>
include, by way of example, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, ALS and cerebral<br>
palsy, among others. In the specific case of Parkinson's disease, it has been demonstrated that<br>
transplanted fetal brain neural cells make the proper connections with surrounding cells and<br>
produce dopamine. This can result in long-term reversal of Parkinson's disease symptoms.<br>
In a related aspect, nerve precursors can be used to reanneal severed/damaged nerve fibers to<br>
restore movement after hand, leg, and spinal cord injuries.<br>
[0136]      One object of the subject invention is that it provides an essentially limitless supply<br>
of pluripotent, human cells that can be used to produce differentiated cells suitable for<br>
autologous transplantation for the oocyte donor. Human embryonic stem cells and their<br>
differentiated progeny derived from blastocysts remaining after infertility treatments, or<br>
created using NT, will likely be rejected by a recipient's immune system when used in<br>
allogenic cell transplantation therapy. Parthenogenically derived stem cells should result in<br>
differentiated cells that could alleviate the significant problem associated with current<br>
transplantation methods, i.e., rejection of the transplanted tissue which may occur because of<br>
host-vs-graft or graft-vs-host rejection relative to the oocyte donor. Conventionally, rejection<br>
is prevented or reduced by the administration of anti-rejection drugs such as cyclosporin.<br>
However, such drugs have significant adverse side-effects, e.g., immunosuppression,<br>
carcinogenic properties, as well as being very expensive. Cells produced by the methods as<br>
<br>
disclosed should eliminate, or at least greatly reduce, the need for anti-rejection drugs relative<br>
to the oocyte donor.<br>
10137]      Another object of the subject invention is that it provides an essentially limitless<br>
supply of pluripotent, human cells that can be used to produce differentiated cells suitable for<br>
allogenic transplantation to members of the oocyte donor's family (e.g., siblings). The cells<br>
will be immunologically and genetically similar to those of the oocytes donor's direct family<br>
members and thus less likely to be rejected by the donor's family members.<br>
[0138]      Another object of this method is that parthenogenic activation of mammalian<br>
oocytes is a relatively simple procedure when compared to SCNT and results in the creation<br>
of stem cells with less cell manipulation.<br>
[0139]      Parthenogenic activation of mammalian oocytes has shown to be more efficient in<br>
the creation of stem cells than methods requiring mechanical manipulation of the oocyte (e.g.,<br>
SCNT).<br>
[0140]      One drawback of SCNT is that subjects with deficient mitochondrial respiratory<br>
chain activity present phenotypes with striking similarities to abnormalities commonly<br>
encountered in SCNT fetuses and offspring (Hiendleder et al, Repro Fertil Dev (2005) 17(1-<br>
2):69-83). Cells normally contain only one type of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), termed<br>
homoplasmy, however, heteroplasmy does exist, usually as a combination of mutant and<br>
wild-type mt DNA molecules or form a combination of wild-type variants (Spikings et al.,<br>
Hum Repro Update (2006) 12(4):401-415). As heteroplasmy can result in mitochondrial<br>
disease, various mechanisms exist to ensure maternal-only transmission. However, with the<br>
increasing use of protocols which bypass normal mechanisms for homoplasmy maintenance<br>
(e.g., cytoplasmic transfer (CT) and SCNT), perturbed mitochondrial function may be<br>
intrinsic to stem cells derived from these sources.<br>
[0141]      In one aspect, as the parthenotes are uniparental, the possibility of heteroplasmy is<br>
minimized.<br>
[0142]      Other diseases and conditions treatable by cell therapy include, by way of example,<br>
spinal cord injuries, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, diabetes, liver diseases Including<br>
acute diseases (viral hepatitis, drug overdoses (acetaminophen) and others), chronic diseases<br>
(chronic hepatitis and others (generally leading to cirrhosis)), heritable liver defects<br>
(hemophilia B, factor IX deficiency, bulirubin metabolism defects, urea cycle defects,<br>
<br>
lysosomal storage disease, al -antitrypsin deficiency and others), heart diseases, cartilage<br>
replacement, burns, foot ulcers, gastrointestinal diseases, vascular diseases, kidney disease,<br>
retinal disease, urinary tract disease, and aging related diseases and conditions.<br>
[0143}      This methodology can be used to replace defective genes, e.g., defective immune<br>
system genes, cystic fibrosis genes, or to introduce genes which result in the expression of<br>
therapeutically beneficial proteins such as growth factors, lymphokines, cytokines, enzymes,<br>
etc.<br>
[0144]      For example, the gene encoding brain derived growth factor may be introduced<br>
into human pluripotent cells produced according to the invention, the cells differentiated into<br>
neural cells and the cells transplanted into a Parkinson's patient to retard the loss of neural<br>
cells during such disease,<br>
[0145]      Also, the subject pluripotent human ES cells, may be used as an in vitro model of<br>
differentiation, in particular for the study of genes which are involved in the regulation of<br>
early development Also, differentiated cell tissues and organs produced using the subject ES<br>
cells may be used in drug studies.<br>
[0146]      Further, the subject ES cells or differentiated cells derived therefrom may he used<br>
as nuclear donors for the production of other ES cells and cell colonies.<br>
[0147]      Still further, pluripotent cells obtained according to the present disclosure may be<br>
used to identify proteins and genes that are involved in embryogenesis. This can be effected,<br>
e.g., by differential expression, i.e., by comparing mRNAs that are expressed in pluripotent<br>
cells provided according to the invention to mRNAs that are expressed as these cells<br>
differentiate into different cell types, e.g., neural cells, myocardiocytes, other muscle cells,<br>
skin cells, etc. Thereby, it may be possible to determine what genes are involved in<br>
differentiation of specific cell types.<br>
[0148]      Further, ES cells and/or their differentiated progeny that have specific genetic<br>
defects, such as the genetic defect that leads to Duchene's Muscular Dystrophy, may be used<br>
as models to study the specific disease associated with the genetic defect.<br>
[0149]      Also, it is another object of the present disclosure to expose pluripotent cell lines<br>
produced according to the described methods to cocktails of different growth factors, at<br>
different concentrations and under different cell culture conditions such as cultured on<br>
<br>
different cell matrices or under different partial pressures of gases so as to identify conditions<br>
that induce the production and proliferation of desired differentiated cell types.<br>
[0150]      The following examples are intended to illustrate but not limit the invention.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Production of Human Parthenogenic Embryogenic Stem Cells<br>
[0151]      Materials and Methods<br>
[0152]      Donors voluntarily donated oocytes, cumulous cells, and blood (for DNA analysis)<br>
with no financial payment. Donors signed comprehensive informed consent documents and<br>
were informed that all donated materials were to be used for research and not for<br>
reproductive purposes. Before ovarian stimulation, oocyte donors underwent medical<br>
examination for suitability according to FDA eligibility determination guidelines for donors<br>
of human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products (Food and Drug<br>
Administration. (Draft) Guidance for Industry: Eligibility Determination for Donors of<br>
Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue Based Products (HCT/Ps) dated May 2004)<br>
and order N 67 (02.26.03) of Russian Public Health Ministry. It included X-ray, blood and<br>
urine analysis, and liver function test. Donors were also screened for syphilis, HIV, HBV,<br>
and HCV.<br>
[0153]      Oocytes were obtained using standard hormonal stimulation to produce<br>
superovulation in the subject donor. Each donor egg underwent ovarian stimulation by FSH<br>
from the 3rd to the 13th days of their menstrual cycle. A total of 1500IU of FSh was given.<br>
From the 10th to the 14th day of the donor's menstrual cycle, gonadoliberin antagonist<br>
Orgalutran (Organon, Holland) was injected at 0.25 mg/day. From the 12th to the 14th day<br>
of the donor's menstrual cycle a daily injection of 75IU FSH + 75IU LH (Menopur, Ferring<br>
GmbH, Germany( was given, If an ultrasound examination displayed follicles between 18<br>
and 20mm in diameter, a single 8000IU dose of hGC (Choragon, Ferring GmbH, Germany)<br>
was administered on the 14th day of the donor's menstrual cycle. Trans-vaginal punction<br>
was performed 35 hours after hCG injection on approximately the 16th day. Follicular fluid<br>
was collected from the antral follicles of anesthetized donors by ultrasound-guided needle<br>
aspiration into sterile tubes.<br>
[0154]      Cumulus oocyte complexes (COCs) were picked from the follicular fluid, washed<br>
in Flushing Medium (MediCult) and then incubated in Universal IVF medium (MediCult, see<br>
Table 1) with a Liquid Paraffin (MediCult) overlay for 2 hours in a 20% 02, 5% C02, at<br>
37°C humidified atmosphere.<br>
(Table-Removed)<br>
[0155]      Before activation, cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) were treated with SynVitro<br>
Hyadase (MediCult, A/S, Denmark) to remove cumulus cells followed by incubation in<br>
Universal IVF medium with a paraffin overlay for 30 minutes.<br>
[0156]      From this point onward, the culture of oocytes and embryos was performed in a<br>
humidified atmosphere at 37°C using Oa-reduced gas mixture (90% N2 + 5% O2 + 5% CO2),<br>
with the exception of the ionomycin treatment. The oocytes were activated by incubation in<br>
<br>
5 uM ionomycin for 5 minutes in a C02 incubator at 37°C in a gas environment of 20% 02,<br>
5% C02, followed by culture with 1 mM 6-dimethylaminopurine (DMAP) for 4 hours in IVF<br>
medium, with paraffin overlay, in a gas environment of 90% N2, 5% 02, and 5% C02 at<br>
37°C. The oocytes were then washed 3 times in IVF. Activation and cultivation were carried<br>
out in 4-well plates (Nunclon, A/S, Denmark) in 500 µl of medium overlaid with liquid<br>
paraffin oil (MediCult, A/S, Denmark).<br>
[0157]      Activated oocytes were cultivated in IVF medium in a gas environment comprising<br>
5% 02, 5% C02, and 90% N2, and embryos generated from the activated oocytes were<br>
cultured in the same gas mixture.<br>
[0158J      Activated oocytes were allowed to incubate in IVF under the above conditions<br>
(i.e., low 02 tension) until fully expanded blastocysts containing an inner cell mass (ICM) at<br>
a Blastocyst Scoring Modification of 1AA or 2AA (Shady Grove Fertility Center, Rockville,<br>
MD, and Georgia Reproductive Specialists, Atlanta, GA) was observed.<br>
[0159]      The zona pellucida was removed by 0.5% pronase (Sigma, St. Louis) treatment.<br>
The ICM from blastocysts was isolated by immuno-surgery where the blastocysts were<br>
incubated with horse antiserum to human spleen cells followed by exposure to guinea pig<br>
complement. Trophoectodern cells were removed from the ICM by gently pipetting the<br>
treated blastocysts.<br>
[0160]      For the derivation of ICM from whole blastocysts, the blastocysts were placed on a<br>
feeder layer in medium designed for culture of phESC (i.e., VitroHES™ media (e.g.,<br>
DMEM/high glucose medium, VitroLife, Sweden) supplemented with 10% human umbilical<br>
cord blood serum, 5 ng/ml human recombinant LIF (Chemicon Int'l, Inc., Temecula, CA), 4<br>
ng/ml recombinant human FGF (Chemicon Int'l, Inc., Temecula, CA) and penicillin-<br>
streptomycin (lOOU/lOOug)). When blastocysts attached and trophoplast cells spread, the<br>
ICM became visible. Through three to four days of additional culture, the ICM was isolated<br>
through mechanical slicing of the ICM from the trophoectoderm outgrowth using a finely<br>
drawn glass pipette. Further, the IMC cells were cultured on a feeder cell layer of mitotically<br>
inactivated post natal human dermal fibroblasts, in VirtroHES™ media (as formulated above)<br>
in a 96-well plate in 5% C02 and 20% 02 at 37°C. This gas mixture was used to culture stem<br>
cells. Human fibroblast cultures were made using non-animal materials. Inactivation of<br>
fibroblasts was carried out using 10 ug/ml mitomycin C (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) for 3 hours.<br>
<br>
10161}      In a separate method, immuno-surgery was performed by incubating blastocysts<br>
with horse antiserum to human spleen cells followed by exposure to rabbit complement. The<br>
trophectoderm cells were removed from the ICM through gentle pipetting of the treated<br>
blastocyts. Further culturing of the isolated ICMs was performed on a feeder layer of<br>
neonatal human skin fibroblasts (HSF) obtained from a genetically unrelated individual (with<br>
parental consent) derived using medium containing human umbilical cord blood serum. The<br>
HSF feeder layer was mitotically inactivated using mitomycin C.<br>
[0162]      The medium for the culture of HSF consisted of 90% DMEM (high glucose, with<br>
L-glutamaine (Invitrogen), 10% human umbilical cord blood serum and penicillin-<br>
streptomycin dlOOU/lOOmg) Invitrogen).<br>
[0163]      For the culture of ICM and phESC, VitroHES™ (Vitrolife) supplemented with<br>
4ng/ml hrbFGF, 5ng/ml hrLIF and 10% human umbilical cord blood serum was used. The<br>
ICM was mechanically plated on a fresh feeder layer and cultured for three to four days. The<br>
first colony was mechanically cut and replated after five days of culture. All subsequent<br>
passages were made after five to six days in culture. For early passages, colonies were<br>
mechanically divided into clumps and replated. Further passing of phESC was performed<br>
with collagenase IV treatment and mechanical dissociation. The propagation of phESC was<br>
performed at 37°C, 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere.<br>
[0164]      Oocyte activation<br>
[0165]      From the initial donor, four oocytes were activated, and the activated oocytes were<br>
cultivated in IVF medium in a gas environment comprising 5% O2, 5% CO2, and 90% N2 and<br>
followed over five (5) days. Table 2 shows the progress of maturation of the activated<br>
oocytes. Each oocyte was separated in a 4-well plate.<br>

<br>
♦Cells were incubfitid in Ml™ media (MediCult) on the first day and M2™ media (MediCult) on days 2-5. Media was<br>
changed everyday. Ml™ and M2™ contain human serum albumin, glucose and derived metabolites, physiological salts,<br>
essential amino acids, non-essential amino acids, vitamins, nucleotides, sodium bicarbonate, streptomycin (40 mg/1),<br>
penicillin (40.000 IU/1) and phenol red.<br>
[0166]      Inner cell masses were isolated from N4 and transferred to human fibroblast feeder<br>
cells as outlined above. Nl and N2 degenerated on Day 6. Further, on Day 6, N3 produced<br>
fully expanded blastocyst with ICM 2AB. N3 was then transferred to human fibroblast<br>
feeder cells on Day 6. ICM from N4 was unchanged. N3 was used to isolate stem cells.<br>
10167]      ICM cells were cultivated in VitroIIES™ medium in a gas environment<br>
comprising 5% CO2, and 95% N2 and followed over forty-five (45) days. Table 2a shows the<br>
progress of N3 ICM cell cultivation.<br>

 (0168]      Stem cell isolation.<br>
[0169]      From the oocytes from 5 donors, the use of MediCult media followed by a culture<br>
under reduced oxygen allowed for the production of 23 blastocysts on the fifth or sixth day of<br>
culture. Eleven of the blastocysts had visible ICMs (Table 3).<br>

 [0170]      These results indicate an approximate 57.5% success rate in the formation of<br>
blastocysts from parthenogenetically activated oocytes.<br>
[0171]      Immunohistochemical staining<br>
[0172]      For immunostaining, hES cell colonies and phESC cells on feeder layers were<br>
seeded onto micro cover glass, washed twice with PBS and fixed with 100% methanol for 5<br>
minutes at -20°C. Cells were washed twice with PBS + 0.05% Tween-20 and permeabilized<br>
with PBS + 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 minutes at room temperature. After cell washing,<br>
non-specific binding was blocked by incubation with blocking solution (PBS + 0.05%<br>
Tween-20 + four percent goat serum plus three percent human umbilical cord blood serum)<br>
for 30 minutes at room temperature (RT). Monoclonal antibodies were diluted in blocking<br>
solution and used for one hour at RT: SSEA-1 (MAJ34301) (1:30), SSEA-3 (MAB4303)<br>
(1:1.0), SSEA-4 (MAB4304) (1:50), OCT-4 (MAB4305) (1:30), TRA-1-60 (MAB4360)<br>
(1:50), and TRA-1-81 (MAB4381) (1:50) from Chemicon. After the cells were washed,<br>
secondary antibodies Alexa Fluor 546 (orange-fluorescent) and 488 (green-fluorescent)<br>
(Molecular Probes, Invitrogen) were diluted 1:1000 in PBS + 0.05% Tween-20 and applied<br>
for one hour at RT. Cells were washed and nuclei were stained with DAPI (Sigma) O.lµg/ml<br>
in PBS + 0.05% Tween-20 during ten minutes at RT. Cells were washed and mounted on<br>
slides with Mowiol (Catbiochem). Fluorescence images were visualized with a fluorescence<br>
microscope.<br>
<br>
[0173]      For the detection of mesodermal markers in three week old embryoid bodies or in<br>
contractile embryoid bodies, monoclonal mouse anti-desmina antibody anti-human alpha<br>
actinin antibody (Chemicon) as the muscle specific markers, and anti-human CD31/PECAM-<br>
1 antibody (R&amp;D Systems), antihuman VE Cadherin (DC144) antibody (R&amp;D Systems) as<br>
the endothelial markers were used.<br>
[0174]      For detection of the endodermal markers in embryoid bodies, monoclonal mouse<br>
anti-human alpha-fetoprotein antibody (R&amp;D Systems) was used.<br>
[0175]      Alkaline phosphatase and telomerase activity<br>
[0176]      Alkaline phosphatase and telomerase activity were performed according to the<br>
manufacturer's specifications with AP kit and TRAPEZE™ Kit (Chemicon).<br>
]0177]      Karyotyping<br>
[0178]      To analyse the karyotype, hES cells were treated with 10µ.g/ml Demecolcine<br>
(Sigma) for two hours, harvested with 0.05% trypsin/EDTA (Invitrogen) and centrifuged at<br>
700 x rpm for three minutes. The pellet was resuspended in 5 ml of 0.56% KC1, and<br>
incubated for 15 minutes at RT. After repeated centrifugation, the supernatant was removed<br>
and cells were resuspended and fixed with 5 ml of an ice cold mixture of mefhanol/acetic acid<br>
(3:1) for five minutes at+4°C. The fixation of the cells was repeated twice, after that the cell<br>
suspension was placed onto microscope slides and the preparations weTe stained with Giemsa<br>
Modified Stain (Sigma). Metaphases from cells prepared in this manner were analyzed by a<br>
standard G-banding method. Quantity of 5/1000 metaphase spreads were revealed and 63<br>
metaphases were analyzed.<br>
10179]      Embryoid body formation<br>
[0180]      hES and phESC cell colonies were mechanically divided into clumps and placed in<br>
wells of a 24 well plate precoated with 1.5% agarose (Sigma) in medium containing 85%<br>
Knockout DMEM, 15% human umbilical cord blood serum, 1 x MEM NEAA, 1 mM<br>
Glutamax, 0.055 mM p-mercaptoethanol, penicillin-streptomycin (50 U/50 mg), 4 ng/ml<br>
hrbFGF (all from Invitrogen, except serum). Human EBs were cultured for 14 days in<br>
suspension culture and placed on a culture dish to give outgrowth or cultivated in suspension<br>
for an additional week.<br>
<br>
[0181]      Neural differentiation was induced by the cultivation of two week old embryoid<br>
bodies attached to a culture dish surface over a period of a week in differentiation medium:<br>
DMEM/F12, B27,2 mM Glutamax,penicillin-streptomycin (lOOU/lOOug) and 20 ng/ml<br>
hrbFGF (all from Invitrogen). Some embryoid bodies gave rise to differentiated cells with<br>
neural morphology, others were dissected and additionally cultured to produce neurospheres.<br>
[0182]      Rhythmically beating embryoid bodies appeared spontaneously following five<br>
days of culture after plating on an adhesive surface in the same medium as was used for<br>
embryoid body generation.<br>
[0183]      HLA typing<br>
[0184]      Genomic DNA was extracted from donor blood, hES, phESC cells, and human<br>
newborn skin fibroblasts (NSFs) with Dynabeads DNA Direct Blood from Dynal<br>
(Invitrogen). HLA typing was performed by PCR with allele-specific sequencing primers<br>
(PCR-SSP, Protrans) according to the manufacturer's specifications. HLA class I genes<br>
(HLA A*,B*,Cw*) were typed with PROTRANS HLA A* B* Cw* defining A*01 -A*80,<br>
B*07-B*83, Cw*01-Cw* 18 regions. HLA class H genes (HLA DRB1*, DRB3*, DRB4*,<br>
DRB5*. DQA1*. DQB1*) were analysed with PROTRANS HLA DRB1* defining<br>
DRB1*01-DRB1*16 (DR1-DR18), DRB3*. DRB4*. DRB5* regions and PROTRANS HLA<br>
DQB1* DQA1* defining DQB1*02- DQB1*06 (DQ2-DQ9), DQA1*0101-DQA1*0601<br>
regions. PCR amplification was achieved: at 94°C for 2 min; 10 cycles at 94°C for 10 sec,<br>
65°C for 1 min; 20 cycles at 94°C for 10 sec, 61°C for 50 sec, 72°C for 30 sec. Amplified<br>
products were detected in 2% agarose gel.<br>
[0185]      Affimetrix SNP microarray analysis<br>
[0186]      Genomic DNA was isolated from blood, cumulus cells, phESC and NSF by<br>
phenol/chloroform extraction method. These DNA samples obtained from four Caucasian<br>
subjects were genotyped with Affimetrix Mapping 50K Hind 240 Array (part of Affimetrix<br>
GeneChip Mapping 100K kit). Initially, the dataset contained 57,244 binary SNP markers.<br>
Since the number of markers is more than would be necessary to identify the equivalency of<br>
genomic samples and to study heterozygosity, 15 (chromosomes 1-15) out of 22 autosomal<br>
chromosomes were chosen. The shorter seven chromosomes were removed to reduce the<br>
chance that no marker, or only a single marker for a given chromosome, is selected during<br>
random sampling. The 1,459 markers were analyzed by Relcheck (version 0.67, Copyright ©<br>

[0187]      Genomic imprinting analysis<br>
[0188]      Total nucleic acid was prepared as described Li et al. (J Biol Chem (2002)<br>
277(16):13518-13527). RNA and DNA were extracted from cells using Tri-reagent (Sigma)<br>
or by using an RNA preparation kit from Qiagen (Valencia, CA).<br>
[0189]      Northern blots containing RNA from the various samples (see FIG. 3) were blotted<br>
onto filters by standard methods (See, e.g., Sambrook et al, Molecular Cloning: A<br>
Laboratory Manual, 1989, 2nd ed, Cold Spring Harbor Press). The Northern filter was<br>
hybridized with single stranded oligonucleotide probes that hybridized specifically to the<br>
rnRNAs. The oligonucleotide probes were end-labeled with [y32P]ATP (AmeTsham<br>
Biosciences). The filters were subsequently washed three times for 10 min each with 0.2 X<br>
SSC (1 X SSC = 0.15 MNaCl and 0.015 M sodium citrate) containing 0.1% SDS at 60°C<br>
and analyzed by Phosphorlmager (Molecular Dynamics). The sequences of the<br>
oligonucleotide probes were obtained from sequences based on the following Accession<br>
Nos.: NP002393 (Pegl_2 and Pegl_A; for these genes, human PEG] is transcribed from two<br>
alternative promoters, resulting in the transcription of two isoforms, of which only one<br>
(isoform 1_2) is imprinted. Paternal expression isoform 1 occurs in conjunction with an<br>
unmethylated CpG island in exon 1 of the paternal allele, whereas the corresponding CpG<br>
island in the maternal gene (isoform 1_A) is fully methylated. See, e.g., Li et al. (2002),<br>
supra); CAG29346 (SNRPN); AF087017 (HI9); NR_001564 (inactive X specific transcripts-<br>
XIST); and P04406 (GAPDH).<br>
[0190]      DNA fingerprinting analysis<br>
[0191]      Genomic DNA was isolated from blood, hES cells, and NSFs through a<br>
phenol/chloroform extraction, digested with Hinfl restriction enzyme (Fermentas) and loaded<br>
in a 0.8% agarose gel. Following electrophoresis, denatured DNA was transferred to a nylon<br>
membrane (Hybond N, AmeTsham) by Southern blotting and hybridized with 32P-labeled<br>
(CAC) 5 oligonucleotide probe. mData were analysed after membrane exposition on X-ray<br>
film (Kodak XAR) using Cronex intensifying screens.<br>
[0192]      Monolocus PCR genotyping<br>
<br>
[0193]     In order to determine allelic identities for minisatellite loci between blood donor<br>
DNA and stem cell DNA, 11 polymorphic sites ((1)3' Apolipoprotein B hypervariable<br>
minisatellite locus (3'ApoB); (2) D1S80 (PMCT118) hypervariable minisatellite locus<br>
(D1S80); (3) D6S366; (4) D16S359; (5) D7S820; (6) Human von Willebrand factor gene<br>
hypervariable minisatellite locus H (vWFII); (7) D13S317; (8) Human von Willebrand factor<br>
gene hypervariable microsatellite locus (vWA); (9) Human c-frns proto-oncogene for CFS-1<br>
receptor gene microsatellite locus (CSF1PO); (10) Human thyroid peroxidase gene<br>
microsatellite locus (TPOX); and (11) Human tyrosine hydroxylase gene microsatellite locus<br>
(TH01)) were analyzed by PCR genotyping. Allele frequencies for known populations (i.e.,<br>
Russian and Caucasian-American populations) determined for the above polymorphic sites<br>
were compared to allele frequencies of these sites in test samples (i.e., hES, NSF, and donor<br>
blood DNA). Chromosomal location, Genbank locus and locus definition, repeat sequence<br>
data, allelic ladder range, VNTR ladder size range, other known alleles, allele sizes, PCR<br>
protocols, and allele frequency results for the 11 minisatellite loci of the disclosed<br>

[0300]      Results<br>
[0301]      The hES cells from this method display many features that are typical for<br>
embryonic stem cells: cytoplasmic lipid bodies, small cytoplasmic/nuclear ratio and clearly<br>
distinguishable nucleoli. The hES cell colonies display similar morphology to that reported<br>
previously for human embryonic stem cells derived after in vitro fertilization. The cells were<br>
immunoreactively positive for alkaline phosphatase (Fig 1 A), octamer-binding transcription<br>
factor 4 mRNA (Oct-4) (Fig IB), stage- specific embryonic antigen 1 (SSEA-1) (Fig<br>
lC),stage- specific embryonic antigen 3 (SSEA-3) (Fig ID), stage-specific embryonic antigen<br>
4 (SSEA-4) (Fig IE), tumor rejection antigen 1-60 (TRA-1-60) (Fig IF), tumor rejection<br>
antigen 1-81 (TRA-1-81) (Fig 1G), and negative for stage-specific embryonic antigen 1<br>
(SSEA-1) (Fig 1C), (which is positive for mouse embryonic stem cells, but not for human).<br>
Telomerase activity is often correlated with replicative immortality and is typically expressed<br>
in germ cells, cancer cells, and a variety of stem cells, including stem cells, but absent in<br>
most somatic cell types. The cells prepared by this method after three months in in vitro<br>
proliferation maintained their undifferentiated morphology and displayed high levels of<br>
telomerase activity (Fig 2A). The pluripotency of the cells was investigated in vitro by<br>
embryoid body formation (Fig 2B, 2C), G-banded karyotyping shows that cells have normal<br>
human 46XX karyotype (Fig 2D).<br>
(0302]      DNA fingerprinting analysis was performed on the blood of the oocyte donor, on<br>
the ES cells, and on the HNSF feeder cells by Southern blotting and hybridization with a 32P<br>
- labeled (CAC)s oligonucleotide probe (Fig 2E), and monolocus polymerase chain reaction<br>
(PCR) with different locuses.<br>
[0303]      For monolocus PCR, genotyping revealed identical alleles for all loci (but one,<br>
D7S820) between blood (donor) DNA and OL1 DNA.   See Table 15.<br>
Table 15. Monolocus PCR genotyping.<br>
<br>
(Table-Removed) <br>
[0304]      Heterozygosity (heterozygosis) of all heterozygous donor loci (but one, D7S820)<br>
was not changed in hES loci. Homozygosity (homozygosis) of D7S820 locus in hBS DNA is<br>
a result of mutation (insertion of one AGAT monomer in microsatellite repeat) due to<br>
slipped-strand mispairing during DNA replication and DNA repair.<br>
[0305]      These results are in accordance with those obtained with multilocus DNA<br>
fingerprinting (when substantially identical fingerprint patterns for donor DNA and hES<br>
DNA were found).<br>
<br>
[0306]      Figure 2E demonstrated heterozygosity of hES cells and their identity with the<br>
oocyte donor's blood, and there was no similarity between the hES cells and the feeder cells.<br>
The DNA profle of hES cell line was confirmed by PCR-based haplotype analysis using<br>
polymorphic genes within the MHC class I and class II. Total genomic DNA from the oocyte<br>
donor blood cells, from hES cells, and feeder HNSFs were genotyped and compared. The<br>
data demonstrated that hES cells and cells from donor blood were indistinguishable from<br>
each other and therefore should be considered autologous, and both distinguished from DNA<br>
of the feeder cells (Table 16).<br>
Table 16. HLA Typing.<br>
<br>
(Table-Removed) <br>
[0307]      DNA fingerprinting and HLA typing analysis confirmed that the hES cells are<br>
heterozygous and contain the whole donor genetic material. These results coincide with data<br>
from parthenogenetic monkey stem cell lines (Vrana et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA (2003)<br>
100(Suppl 1):11911-11916), and do not coincide with data from parthenogenetic mouse stem<br>
cell lines (Lin et al., Stem Cells (2003) 21:153-161), which contains half of the donor genetic<br>
material.<br>
[0308]      The phESC lines display a morphology expected in hES cells, forming colonies<br>
with tightly packed cells, prominent nucleoli and a small cytoplasm to nucleus ratio (FIG. 4).<br>
These cells express traditional hES markers SSEA-3, SSEA-4, TRA-1-60, TRA-1-81, and<br>
OCT-4, and do not express SSEA-1, a positive marker for undifferentiated mouse embryonic<br>
stem cells (FIG. 4). The cells derived from all lines demonstrate high levels of alkaline<br>
phosphatase and telomerase activity (FIG. 5 and FIG. 6). G-banded karyotyping showed that<br>
phESC lines have a normal human 46.XX karyotype, with the exception of the phESC-7 line<br>
(FIG. 7). Approximately 91% of cells from the phESC-7 line have a 47.XXX karyotype and<br>
9% of the cells have a 48,XXX,+6 karyotype. A different degree of X chromosome<br>
 <br>
heteromorphism was observed in the lines; approximately 12% of the phESC-1 and phESC-6<br>
lines; 42% for the phESC-5 line; and 70, 80, and 86 % for the cell lines phESC7, phESC-3,<br>
and phESC-4, respectively (FIG. 7).<br>
10309]      Comparative DNA profiling of was performed on all the phESC lines, the donor<br>
somatic cells and the feedei cells. These studies used Affimetrix SNP microarrays (Mapping<br>
50K Hind 240 Arrays) to study chromosome changes and to confirm the genetic similarity of<br>
the phESC to the donor's somatic cells. All paired genotype relationships between phESC<br>
lines and their associated donor somatic cells were identified as "full siblings", and all other<br>
combinations of pans were identified as "unrelated". Internal controls identified the paired<br>
genotype relationship between split cultures derived from the same phESC line as<br>
"monozygotic twins" (Table 17, Database SI).<br>
Table 17. Database SI.<br>
<br>
(Table-Removed)<br>
DMA samples were numbered aS follows: 1-human neonatal skin fibroblasts; 2-phESC-7 line donor; 3-phESC-7<br>
line; 4-phESC-l line; 5-phBSC-l line; 6"-phESC-3 line; 7-phBSC-4 line; 8-phBSC-5 line; 9-phESC-6 line; 10-<br>
phBSC-6 line donor; ll-phBSC-3 to phESC-5 lines donor; and 12-phESC-l line donor.<br>
The result shows that only one pair (sample 4-5), has been identified as monozygotic (MZ) twins.<br>
Ten other pairs (samples 2-3, 4-12, 5-12, 6-7,6-11, 7-8,7-11, 8-11, 9-10) have been identified as full siblings,<br>
and all the other combination of pairs have been identified as unrelated. The IBS columns in the output display<br>
the number of markers at which the pair are both typed and share 0,1, or 2 alleles identical by state (For MZ<br>
twins under ideal conditions of no genotyping errors, all markers must be placed under IBS=2). The output does<br>
not display P (observed markers | given relationship) directly, but it displays LOD score - log10 {P(observed<br>
markers | putative re!ationship/P(observed markers | relationship for which maximum likelihood was obtained<br>
and thus the call was made)} as a measure of similarity. The smaller the LOD score is, the less likely the<br>
putative relationship between two samples it.<br>
 [03101      Comparative analysis of 1,459 SNP markers revealed phESC heterozygosity and<br>
showed that changes had occurred in the phESC cell genotype in comparison to the related<br>
donor somatic cell genotype. Some segments of the somatic cell genome that had formerly<br>
been heterozygous became homozygous in the related phESC line genome. This<br>
heterozygous to homozygous pattern occurred in 11-15% of the phESC-1, PhESC-3, phESC-<br>
4, phESC-5 and phESC-6 lines, and was 19% for the phESC7 line (Database S2). Moreover,<br>
genetic differences were observed between the phESC and phBSC-5 lines that had been<br>
derived from the same oocyte donor (Table 18, Database S2).<br>

10311]      In prior research, parthenogenetic activation of mouse oocytes has resulted in<br>
homozygous embryonic stem cell lines (Lin et al., Stem Cells (2003) 21:152). In human<br>
oocytes, the suppression of the second meiotic division after oocyte parthenogenetic<br>
activation and the generation of diploid embryos does not lead to the derivation of wholly<br>
homozygous hES cells.<br>
[0312]      Based on the HLA-typing results, differentiated cells derived from all phESC lines<br>
should be wholly histocompatible with the oocyte donors, making this a method to create<br>
cells of therapeutic use (Table 19).<br>
Table 19. HLA-tvphig for ohESC cell lines<br>
<br>
(Table-Removed) <br>
[0313] DNA-profiling of the genetic material derived from the human fibroblasts used as<br>
feeder cells revealed no contamination of the pliESC cell lines with material from the human<br>
fibroblasts (Table 19).<br>
[0314]      The phESC-1 line remained undifferentiated during ten months of culture,<br>
spanning 35 passages. The other cell lines were successfully cultivated over at least 21<br>
passages. The cells from all phESC lines formed cystic embryoid bodies in suspension<br>
culture and gave rise to derivatives of all three germ layers: ectoderm, mesoderm, and<br>
endoderm, after differentiation in vitro (FIG. 4). Approximately 5% of embryoid bodies from<br>
the phESC-l line gave rise to beating cells five days following plating. The phESC-6 line<br>
produced pigmented epithelial-like cells (FIG. 41, K). Ectoderm differentiation is presented<br>
by positive immunocytochemical staining for neuron specific markers neurofiliment 68 (FIG.<br>
4A), NCAM (FIG. 4B), beta IH-tubulin (FIG. 4C) and the glial cell marker GFAP (FIG. 4D,<br>
M). Differentiated cells were positive for mesoderm markers including alpha-actinin (FIG.<br>
4G) and desmin (FIG. 4J), which are muscle specific markers, and the endothelial markers<br>
PECAM-1 (FIG. 4E) and VE-Cadherin (FIG. 4F). Endoderm differentiation is presented by<br>
positive staining of differentiated derivatives for alpha-fetoprotein. These data demonstrate<br>
that phESC can be differentiated into the three germ layers that lead to all cell types of a<br>
human body.<br>
 [0315]      The altered karyotype of phESC-7 may be a reason to exclude it form clinical use.<br>
Alterations of genomic imprinting in human embryos can contribute to the development of<br>
disorders linked to maternally or paternally expressed genes (Gabriel et al., Proc Natl Acad<br>
Sci USA (1998) 95:14857). In order to investigate other characteristics of the phESC lines,<br>
and to determine their suitability for use in cell therapy, imprinting analysis was performed.<br>
[0316]      Northern blots were made and screened with DNA probes SNRPN, Pegl_2,<br>
PeglA, HI 9, and GAPDH (as an internal control) as outlined above. Blotted nucleic acids<br>
were obtained from NSF, neonatal skin fibroblasts; hES, human embryonic stem cell line<br>
derived from fertilized oocytes; 1, phESC-1; 2, phESC-3, 3, phESC-4, 4, phESC-5; 5,<br>
phESC-6; 6 phESC-7. NSF RT-, hES RT-, 1 RT- are negative controls. FIG. 3 shows the<br>
results of the imprinting blot.<br>
[0317]      The maternal imprinting gene, Pegl_A shows strong binding in all of the cell lines<br>
tested. Weaker (relative to Pegl_A), but consistent binding was observed in all of the cell<br>
lines for the maternal imprinting gene H19. SNRPN shows binding predominantly in NSF,<br>
hES, phESC-4, and phESC-6.   Pegl_2 shows binding predominantly in NSF, hES, phESC-1<br>
(weaker signal), phESC-3, phESC-5, and phESC-6. GAPDH binding confirmed similar<br>
loading of RNA in all lanes.<br>
[0318]      Although the invention has been described with reference to the above examples, it<br>
will be understood that modifications and variations are encompassed within the spirit and<br>
scope of the invention. Accordingly, the invention is limited only by the following claims.<br>

sibling, or unrelated according to single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers.<br>
29.	The library of claim 27, wherein the oocyte donor is histocompatible with a member of<br>
the library.<br>
<br>
30.	The library of claim 27, wherein a member of the library is genomically imprinted<br>
according to the oocyte donor origin.<br>
31.	A cell bank comprising cryopreserved parthenotes, wherein the parthenotes are derived<br>
from parthenogenetically activated oocytes from one or more human donors.<br>
32.	The cell bank of claim 31, wherein the parthenotes have been cultivated under low O2<br>
tension until blastocyst formation.<br>
33.	A cell bank comprising cryopreserved autologous stem cells, wherein the stem cells are<br>
derived from parthenogenetically activated oocytes from one or more human donors.<br>
34.	A method of treating a subject in need thereof, comprising administering a cellular<br>
composition comprising differentiated cells, wherein the differentiated cells are derived from a<br>
stem cell obtained from a parthenogenetically activated oocyte from a human donor.<br>
35.	A method of generating cloned human embryonic stem cell lines comprising:<br>
<br>
a)	removing a first pro-nuclei from a previously fertilized human oocyte;<br>
b)	transferring a second pro-nuclei into the enucleated oocyte of step (a)<br>
wherein the second pro-nuclei is derived from:<br>
i) a donor oocyte or an oocyte from the mother of the donor, or<br>
ii) a parthenogenetically activated oocyte, wherein the pro-nuclei of the<br>
oocyte has been replaced by the nucleus of a donor somatic cell prior<br>
to activation;<br>
and<br>
c)	cultivating the resulting oocyte of step (b) until blastocyst formation,<br>
wherein an inner cell mass from the blastocyst contains the embryonic stem cells.<br>
36.	A method of producing human stem cells,  substantially as hereinbefore<br>
described with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
