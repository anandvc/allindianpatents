BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
(1)  Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing N-(substituted)-C-(substituted methyl)-oxazolidinones, C- (substituted methyl)-oxazolidinones, and N- (substituted)-C-(substituted methyl)-oxazolidinones, preferably chiral, from optically active C- (protected oxymethyl)-oxazolidinones.

A number of substituted oxazolidinones produced using the above process have<br><br>
been discovered to have antimicrobial activity.<br>
(2) Description of Related Art<br>
Oxazolidinones,   particularly   substituted oxazolidinones    such    as     3- (substituted)-5-alkylaminomethyl-       and       3- (sxibstituted) -5-acylaininomethyl-2-oxazolidinones,  are  an  important class of drug substances which are used for a wide variety of drug applications.   These applications include use as antibacterial agents and in therapies for treating behavior disorders  (Bowersock et aJ., Antimicrob. Agents Chemotherp. 44: 1367-1369 (2000); Skold,  Acta Vet.  Scand.  Suppl.  93:  23-3 6  (2000); Diekema and Jones, Drugs 59: 7-16 (2000); Genin et al., J. Med. Chem. 43: 953-970 (2000); Johnson et al., J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 45: 225-230 (20O0); Schulin et al.,      Antimicrob. Agents Chemotherp. 43: 2873-2876<br>

Soc. 212: 389-ORGN, Part 2, (Aug. 25, 1996)).<br>
There are several methods for making the oxazolidinone nucleus in 3-(substituted)-5-alkylaminomethyl- and 3-(substituted)-5-acylaminomethyl-2-oxazolidinones. The general structure of 3-(substituted)-5-(substituted methyl)-2-oxazolidinone is<br><br><br>
wherein R1 is alkyl, aryl, heteroalkyl, heteroaryl, or mixture thereof, or hydrogen or hydroxy, and R2 is alkyl, aryl, heteroalkyl, heteroaryl, or mixture thereof. The following disclose processes for preparing oxazolidinones and substituted oxazolidinones.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,288,238 Bl to Hollingsworth and Wang disclose a process for preparing 5-hydroxyinethyl-2-oxazolidinones in one step from 3,4-boronic acid ester protected 3,4-dihydroxybutyramides.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,288,239 Bl to Hollingsworth and Wang discloses a process for preparing 5-trityloxymethyl-2-oxazolidinones and suggests a scheme for the alkylation of N-lithio-N-substituted carbamates with oxiranes such as glycidyl butyrate as shown in Scheme 1.<br><br>

Glycidyl equivalents such as epichlorohydrin can	be<br>
used instead of glycidyl butyrate.<br>

oxiranylmethylacetamides   to   prepare   chiral	3-<br>
(substituted) -5-acet ami dome thyl-2-oxazolidinones	in<br>
one step by the alkylation of N-lithio-N-aryl	(or<br>
alkyl) carbamates as shown in Scheme 2.<br>
Scheme 2<br><br>
However, the above processes do not allow for the rapid synthesis of a plurality of substituted<br><br>
oxazolidinones at the same time in the same reaction. Thus, producing a plurality of substituted oxazolidinones for drug screening is slow and cumbersome which affects the rate in which new and useful drugs can be discovered. Therefore, there remains a need for a rapid and simple process that can produce a plurality of substituted oxazolidinones at the same time in the same reaction. Being able to produce a plurality of drug candidates in a short period of time would accelerate the rate at which new and useful drugs and other compounds are discovered. The present invention provides a simple and rapid process for synthesizing substituted oxazolidinones.<br>
Strains of Gram positive bacteria resistant to the present repertoire of antibiotics have been increasing in prevalence over the past several decades (Skold, Acta Vet. Scand. Suppl. 93: 23-36 (2000) ) . Resistant Gram positive that have been commonly encountered include among others those in the staphylococci, streptococci, pneumococci, and enterococci families. Because of the increasing prevalence of these antibiotic resistant bacterial strains, there is a clear need for new antimicrobial agents.<br>
Several species of substituted oxazolidinones have been discovered to be effective antimicrobial agents against particular antibiotic resistant strains of Gram positive bacteria. Linezolid (Clemett and Markham, Drugs 59: 815-827 (2000) ; Johnson et al., J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 45: 225-230 (2000) ) is a substituted oxazolidinone which has been approved for the treatment of microbial infections.   The structure of linezolid is  shown<br><br>
below.<br><br>
A number of other substituted oxazolidinones with varying degrees of antibacterial activity against Gram positive and in some cases Gram negative bacteria are also known (Barry, Antimicrob. Agents Chemotherp. 32: 150-152 (1988) ; Brickner et al., J. Med. Chem. 39: 673-679 (1996); Genin et aJ., J. Med. Chem. 43: 953-970 (2000) ; Slee et aJ., Antimicrob. Agents Chemotherp. 31: 1791-1797 (1987)).<br>
Most/ if not all, of the known substituted oxazolidinones which have been found to have antibacterial activity have the structure shown below wherein the R3 substituent is aryl and the relative stereochemistries of the groups on the chiral center (C-5) is as indicated.<br><br>
A comparison of the structures for* all of the known substituted oxazolidinones which have antimicrobial activity, the general consensus has arisen that there are at least three elements of these substituted oxazolidinones which are critical for biological activity.  The first element is that when<br><br>
the oxazolidinone ring is oriented as shown below such that all the ring atoms are in one plane, the carbonyl oxygen points up, the ring nitrogen is to the left, and the 5-substituent is to the right, then of the two possible orientations for the 5-substituent (distal or proximal), the proximal substituent is required for biological activity.<br><br>
The second element is that the 3-substituent is an aryl. The third element is that the 5-substituent is an alkylamino methyl or an acetamidomethyl group. l^o substituted oxazolidinone which has antibacterial activity has been found which does not have all three of the above elements.<br>
Because microorganisms will eventually develop resistance to antibiotics, there is a continual need for new antibiotics. The present invention provides families of novel substituted oxazolidinones which have antimicrobial activity but which have structures which do not conform to the consensus structure thought to be necessary for antimicrobial activity.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
All patents, patent applications, government publications, government regulations, and literature references cited in this specification are hereby incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.<br><br>
In  case  of  conflict,  the  present  description, including definitions, will control.<br>
The  present  invention  provides  a  novel process for preparing collections or combinatorial libraries  of  substituted  oxazolidinones.     In particular, the present invention provides a process for preparing libraries of optically active or chiral N- (substituted) -C- (substituted methyl) -oxazolidinones, N-(substituted)-C-(methyl)-oxazolidinones,    and   C-(substituted methyl)-oxazolidinones bearing alkyl or aryl substituents in the N-substituted position (3-position)  and  a methyl  group  substituted with  a heteroatom such as 0, N, or S in the C-substituted position (4- or 5-position) and wherein the heteroatom is further substituted with hydrogen or acyl, alkyl, aryl, heteroalkyl, heteroaryl, heterocycle, phenacyl, aryl sulfonyl, or mixture thereof.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the substituted oxazolidinones comprising the library are optically active or chiral N- (substituted)-C-(substituted methyl)-2-oxazolidinones, N-(substituted)-C-(methyl)-2-oxazolidinones, and C- (substituted)-2-oxazolidinones bearing alkyl or aryl substituents in the N-substituted position (3-position) and a methyl group substituted with a heteroatom in the C-substituted position (4- or 5-position) and wherein the heteroatom is further substituted with hydrogen or acyl, alkyl, aryl, heteroalkyl, heteroaryl, heterocycle, phenacyl, aryl sulfonyl, or mixture thereof.<br>
As used herein, the term ^'substituted" refers to groups other than hydrogen substituted at the N-position or the methyl at the C-position. Preferably,  the  substituting  group  is  an  organic<br><br>
group. Therefore, when the N-position is substituted, it is substituted with a group such as acyl, alkyl, aryl, heteroalkyl, heteroaryl, heterocycle, aryl sulfonyl, phenacyl, or mixture thereof. When N is not referred to as being 'substituted", the N has a hydrogen at the N-position. When the C-position methyl is substituted, it is referred to as 'substituted methyl" wherein "substituted" is a group such as acyl, alkyl, aryl, heteroalkyl, heteroaryl, heterocycle, phenacyl, aryl sulfonyl, or mixture thereof.<br>
The general structure of these substituted oxazolidinones is shown below<br><br>

The process for synthesis of the substituted<br><br>
oxazolidinones preferably uses an optically active C-protected oxazolidinone as the starting material, preferably a 5-(protected hydroxymethyl)-oxazolidinone such as 5-trityloxymethyl-oxazolidinone wherein the trityl is triphenylmethyl. Most preferably, the protected oxazolidinone is a 5- (protected hydroxymethyl)-2-oxazolidinone which in a further preferred embodiment is a 5-trityloxymethyl-2-oxazolidinone. The synthesis of 5"trityloxymethyl-2-oxazolidinone and its use are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,288,239 Bl to Hollingsworth and Wang. The structure of 5-trityloxymethyl-2-oxazolidinone is shown below.<br><br>
The general process for producing a library of substituted oxazolidinones comprises the following steps. First, a C-(protected oxymethyl)-oxazolidinone is N-arylated with a mixture of compounds comprising a plurality of different aryl acyl, alkyl, aryl, heteroalkyl, heteroaryl, heterocycle, aryl sulfonyl, or phenacyl bromides under Buchwald conditions (Yin and Buchwald, Org. Letts 2: 1101-1104 (2000) ) or by simple alkylation under nitrogen. This produces a plurality of N- (substituted) -C- (protected oxymethyl) -oxazolidinones (I).<br><br>
For example, under simple alkylation conditions, a C-(protected oxymethyl)-oxazolidinone is dissolved in an organic solvent such as tetrahydrofuran (THF) containing a strong base (alkali) which preferably does not have substantial reducing activity or which has reducing activity which is suppressed at low temperatures* Hydrides are strong bases which are suitable for the reaction* Preferably, the strong base is an ionic hydride such as an alkali hydride. Most preferred is sodium hydride which is a powerful base without substantial reducing activity. Other strong bases which may be used include lithium hydride, potassium hydride, rubidium hydride, cesium hydride, sodium alcoholates, sodium amide, and metallic sodium. In general, about 1 equiv. of the strong base (alkali), preferably sodium hydride, is added to the solvent containing the C- (protected oxymethyl)-oxazolidinone. In the case of sodium hydride, which is insoluble in organic solvents, the sodium hydride is provided as a suspension in an organic solvent such as hexane. After allowing the mixture containing the protected oxazolidinone and strong base to incubate at about 0° C for about 10 minutes with stirring under an inert atmosphere such as nitrogen, the mixture is warmed to room temperature and stirred for about two hours and a mixture of n different arylating reagents, preferably in a molar ratio of about 1 to 1 to 1 to 2 (C-(protected oxymethyl)-oxazolidinone to mixture), is added. The reaction is incubated at room temperature with stirring for a time (about eight hours) sufficient to arylate the N at the 3~position with the n  different  arylating  reagents  to  produce  n  N-<br><br>
(substituted)-C-(protected oxymethyl)-oxazolidinones. The reaction is then quenched by adding an aqueous solution containing an acid such as NH4CI and the N-(substituted)-C-protected oxymethyl)-oxazolidinones are recovered by extracting the quenched reaction with the organic solvent, drying the extract over a drying agent such as anhydrous Na2SO4, and concentrating the extract under reduced pressure (in vacuo), The N-(substituted)-C-(protected oxymethyl)-oxazolidinones are preferably purified by chromatography.<br>
Under Buchwald conditions, the C-(protected oxymethyl)-oxazolidinone and about 1 to 2 equiv. of a mixture of n different arylating reagents are incubated with a Pd(0Ac)2 catalyst in an organic solvent such as tetrahydrofuran (THF) under an inert atmosphere such as argon at a temperature between about 45o to 110oC for a time sufficient to arylate the N at the 3-position with the n different arylating reagents to produce n N- (s\ibstituted) -C- (protected oxymethyl)-oxazolidinones (in general, about eight hours as determined by gas chromatography) . The reaction is then cooled to room temperature, diluted with an organic solvent such as dichloromethane, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure (in vacuo) - The N-(substituted)-C-(protected oxymethyl)--oxazolidinones are preferably purified by chromatography.<br>
Next, the N-arylated oxazolidinones (N-substituted) are deprotected in the usual fashion by hydrogenolysis using H2 and a palladium catalyst or an acid such as to produce a library of n N-(substituted)-C-hydroxymethyl-Oxazolidinones (II). For example, the N-arylated oxazolidinones, preferably<br><br>
purified by chromatography or the like, are incubated in an aqueous solvent such as wet dichloromethane (CH2CI2) (about 8:1 CH2Cl2:H2O) further containing an acid such as trifluoroacetic acid {CF3CO2H) at room temperature for a time sufficient (about four hours) to deprotect the C-hydroxymethyl. Preferably, the C-protecting group in the above reaction is a triphenylmethyl group. The reaction is quenched by adding triethylamine or other quenching agent and the deprotected oxazolidinone concentrated under reduced pressure (in vacuo) . The concentrated deprotected oxazolidinone is preferably further purified by chromatography.<br>
In a further step, the n N-(substituted)-C-<br>
hydroxymethyl-oxazolidinones (II) are O-functionalized<br>
with a mixture of n different alkylation, acylation,<br>
sulfonylation, halogenation, or other such species.<br>
For example, a mixture containing a plurality of<br>
different acyl, alkyl, aryl, heteroalkyl, heteroacyl,<br>
heteroaryl, heterocycle, phenacyl, aryl sulfonyl,<br>
amides thereof, thiols thereof, or other such species,<br>
or the O of the hydroxymethyl is replaced by N-aryl,<br>
N-sulfonyl, N-sulfide, or other N-species, or the O of<br>
the hydroxymethyl is replaced by a thioalkyl,<br>
thioaryl, or other thio-species. Methods for<br>
converting the hydroxyl group to a nitrogen containing<br>
function can be done by any of the methods which are<br>
known. These include mesylation or tosylation<br>
followed by displacement with ammonia, azide,<br>
benzylamine, or other nitrogen nucleophiles as taught<br>
for example in U.S. Patent No. 6,288,239 Bl to<br>
Hollingsworth and Wang or U.S. Patent No. 5,837,870 to<br>
Pearlman  et al.	For  example, n     substituted<br><br>
oxazolidinones   (11),	preferably   purified   by<br>
chromatography or the like, are then incubated in an organic solvent such as dry dichloromethane containing about 1 equiv. pyridine and about 1 equiv. of a mixture of n different acyl, alkyl, aryl, heteroalkyl, heteroaryl, heterocycle, phenacyl, aryl sulfonyl, thios and amides thereof, or other such species halides at room temperature for time sufficient (about 12 to 16 hours) to functionalize the C-hydroxymethyl at the 4- or 5-position. Afterwards, the reaction is quenched by addition of ammonium chloride, extracting the organic layer with dichloromethane, drying the organic layer extract over a drying agent such as anhydrous Na2SO4, and concentrating under reduced pressure (in vacuo) , The above process generates a library of n2 N-(substituted)-C-(substituted methyl)-oxazolidinones (III) . For example, if ten different aryl bromides reagents are used in the first step and ten different halide reagents in the second step, 100 N-(substituted)-C-(substituted)-oxazolidinones (III) are obtained.<br>
Each of the products (I, II, or III) produced above can be separated chromatographically and each separately evaluated as drug or antimicrobial candidates.<br>
The process takes advantage of the ease of reaction of the nitrogen atom at the 3-position in C-(protected oxymethyl)-oxazolidinones which enables both arylation and alkylation sequences for substituting the N to be used, A further advantage is that in one or two steps, the protecting group can be removed and the hydroxyl group functionalized. In the same scheme, the oxygen substituent at the C-position<br><br>
methyl can be replaced with halo, thio, phenoxy, azidO, or substituted nitrogen groups under standard Mitsunobu conditions (Mitsunobu, Synthesis 1 (1981)), Alternatively, the hydroxyl group can be first converted to a sulfonate, halo, or other such activating group.<br>
Thus, the process involves essentially two steps, the first step is generating a first library of n N-(substituted)-C-hydroxymethyl-oxazolidinones from a C-protected oxazolidinone and the second step is 0-functionalizing acylating the C-hydroxymethyl to generate a library of n2  N-(substituted)-C-(siobstituted methyl)-oxazolidinones.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the first library comprises at least 10 different N-(substituted)-C-hydroxymethyl-oxazolidinones prepared by reacting C-(protected oxymethyl)-oxazolidinones with at least 10 different N-arylating reagents and the second library comprises at least 100 different N-(substituted)-C-(substituted)-oxazolidinones prepared by reacting the ten N-(substituted)-C-hydroxymethyl-oxazolidinones with at least ten different 0-functionalizing acylating reagents. In other embodiments of the library, the substituted oxazolidinones comprise a plurality of molecules with N-position substitutions and a single substitution group at the C-position of the molecules or a plurality of molecules with C-position substitutions and a single substitution group at the N-position of the molecules. A further embodiment of the library can comprise substituted oxazolidinones with either N-position substitutions only (N-(substituted)-C-(methyl)-oxazolidinones) or C-position substitutions only {C-(substituted methyl)-<br><br>
oxazolidinones. The particular library embodiment chosen depends on the particular objectives of the drug or antimicrobial screening program.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the oxazolidinone is 2-oxazolidinone. In a further preferred embodiment as shown in Scheme 3 below, the C-(protected hydroxymethyl)-2-oxazolidinone is C-trityloxymethyl-2-oxazolidinone. The C-trityloxymethyl-2-oxazolidinone is N-arylated (N at position 3) with a mixture of n different aryl acyl, alkyl, aryl, heteroalkyl, heteroaryl, heterocycle, aryl sulfonyl, or phenacyl bromides, or other such bromides under Buchwald conditions (Yin and Buchwald, Org. Letts. 2: 1101-1104 (2000)) or simple alkylation under nitrogen to produce N-(substituted)-C-trityloxymethyl-2-oxazolidinones. The trityl (Tr) group is then removed by hydrogenation to produce a library of n N-(substituted)-C-hydroxymethyl-2-oxazolidinones.<br><br><br>
In a further step, the N-(substituted)-C-hydroxyinethyl-2-oxazolidinones are O-functional! zed acylated with a mixture of n different acyl, alkyl, aryl, heteroalkyl, heteroaryl, heterocycle, phenacyl, aryl sulfonyl, amides thereof, or other such species halides, or the 0 of the hydroxymethyl is replaced by N-aryl, N-sulfonyl, N-sulfide, or other N-species, or the O is replaced by a thioalkyl, thioaryl, or other thio-species. This generates a library of n^ N-(substituted)-C-(substituted methyl)-2-oxazolidinones, For example, if ten aryl bromides reagents are used in the first step and ten halide species reagents in the second step, a total of 100 N-(substituted)-C-(substituted methyl)-2-oxazolidinones are made. In one embodiment, the starting oxazolidinone is 4-(protected oxymethyl) -2-oxazolidinone, preferably 4-trityloxymethyl-oxazolidinone,  and  the n      library<br><br>
comprises	3-(substituted)-4-hydroxymethyl-2-<br>
oxazolidinone and the n2 library comprises 3-<br>
(substituted) -4- (substituted methyl)-2-oxazolidinone.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the starting oxazolidinone<br>
is 5-(protected oxymethyl)-2-oxazolidinone, preferably<br>
5-trityloxymethyl-oxazolidinone, and the n library<br>
comprises	3-(substituted)-5-hydroxymethyl-2-<br>
oxazolidinone and the n2 library comprises 3-(substituted) -5- (substituted methyl)-2-oxazolidinone.<br>
The novel process allows for the rapid<br>
synthesis of a plurality of substituted oxazolidinones<br>
including but not limited to 3-(substituted) -5-<br>
(substituted methyl)-oxazolidinones, 3-(substituted)-<br>
4-(substituted methyl)-oxazolidinones, 3-<br>
(substituted)-5-(substituted methyl)-2-oxazolidinones,<br>
3-(substituted)-4-(substituted	methyl)-2-<br>
oxazolidinones, 3-(substituted)^5-hydroxymethyl-oxazolidinones, 3-(substituted)-4-hydroxymethyl-oxazolidinones, 3-(substituted)-5-hydroxymethyl-2-oxazolidinones, and 3- (substituted)-4-hydroxymethyl-2-oxazolidinones. The number of substituted oxazolidinones synthesized by the novel 'process depends on the number of substituting reagents included in the process. Therefore, the use of substituting reagents such as sulfur, nitrogen, and oxygen nucleophiles on the primary hydroxyl group and the amine group of the oxazolidinones affords access to a plurality of families of optically active compounds in a single process which is fast and simple.<br>
The substituted oxazolidinones produced by the above process can be separated using standard chromatography methods and the separated substituted<br><br>
oxazolidinones screened for biological activity including antimicrobial activity or for usefulness as a drug or an intermediate for synthesizing a drug-Technologies and methods for screening compounds in combinatorial libraries are well known in the art.<br>
For any particular substituted oxazolidinone which has useful characteristics, biological activities, or which is a useful intermediate for the synthesis of other compounds, the above process for making the combinatorial library is modified to a process for making the particular substituted oxazolidinone. The modified process differs from the process for preparing the library in that the plurality of reagents shown in Scheme 3 and described above is replaced with the particular reagents which will result in the synthesis of the particular substituted oxazolidinone. Thus, the general method involves the following steps: (1) substituting the N-group of optically active C-protected oxazolidinone, preferably trityloxy-2-oxazolidione, by simple alkylation under nitrogen or N-arylating under Buchwald conditions to produce an N-substituted oxazolidinone, (2) removing the C-protecting group, and (3) substituting the hydrogen of the C-4 or C-5 hydroxymethyl with an alkylation, acylation, arylation, sulfonylation, or other such species halide, or substituting the hydroxy group with a thioalkyl, thioaryl, or other thio-group species to replace the 0 of the hydroxymethyl with S, or substituting the hydroxy group under conditions with an N-acyl, N-sulfonyl, N-sulfide, or other N-group species to replace the O of the hydroxymethyl with N. The  above  process  enables  particular  substituted<br><br>
oxazolidinones  of  any  one  of  the  eight  families (Families I to VIII) to be prepared.<br>
When libraries comprising substituted<br>
oxazolidinones prepared according to the process of<br>
the present invention were tested for antimicrobial<br>
activity, many of the substituted oxazolidinones in<br>
the libraries with the genus structure were discovered<br>
to have antimicrobial activity against gram positive<br>
and Gram negative bacteria. In particular, many of<br>
the substituted oxazolidinones were found to be active<br>
against Gram positive bacteria such as those of the<br>
genera Staphlococcus and Enterococcus and Gram<br>
negative bacteria such as those of the genera<br>
Escherichia with 90 to 100% Minimum Inhibitory<br>
Concentrations (MIC90-100) of less than 10 yg,mL. The<br>
discovery that many of the novel substituted<br>
oxazolidinones had antibacterial activity was<br>
surprising since the novel substituted oxazolidinones<br>
do not contain all three elements considered necessary<br>
for antibacterial activity. Thus, the novel<br>
substituted oxazolidinones represent an new class of<br>
antimicrobial agents which are active against a<br>
variety of bacteria, in particular. Gram positive<br>
bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas<br>
aeriginose, pneumococci {Streptococcus pneumoniae),<br>
enterococci   {Enterococcus       faecium,	Enterococcus<br>
faecalis, Enterococcus gallinarum), Groups A, B, C, and G streptococci. Streptococcus oralisf and Streptococcus sanguis and Gram negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli.<br>
Preferably, the substituted oxazolidinones with antimicrobial activity are embraced by the species of Families I to VIII.  Tables 2 and 3 show<br><br>
examples of substituted oxazolidinones produced as disclosed herein which have been shown to have antimicrobial activity. Tables 1 and 2 show the results of analyses of the antimicrobial activity for several of the substituted oxazolidinones. The substituted oxazolidinones which are particularly useful antimicrobials have an MIC90-100 against at least one gram positive bacteria of about 300 pg,mL or less, preferably, of about 100 ug,mL or less, most preferably, of about 10 pg,mL or less. Because particular strains of these bacteria species have developed antibiotic resistance, the novel substituted oxazolidinones are particularly useful for use against the antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria such as those shown in Table 1.<br>

The  following  examples  are  intended  to promote  a  further  understanding  of  the  present<br><br>
EXAMPLE 1 This example illustrates the preparation of<br>
(S)-5"trityloxymethyl"2-oxazolidinone using the process disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,288^239 Bl to Hollingsworth and Wang.<br>
In  a  flask,   (S)-3,4-dihydroxybutyramide<br>
(11.9 g,  0.10 moles)  was dissolved in 50 mL of<br>
tetrahydrofuran   (THF)   to   which   50   mL   of<br>
dimethylformamide  and  10  mL  pyridine  was  added<br>
followed by 30.6 g (0.11 moles) of trityl chloride.  A<br>
drying tube filled with calcium chloride was used to<br>
exclude moisture.  The reaction mixture was stirred<br>
for 36 hours at room temperature.   Afterwards,  the<br>
reaction mixture was filtered to remove the solids.<br>
The liquid was concentrated under reduced pressure to<br>
remove most of the solvent.   The concentrate was<br>
poured into ice water, stirred for about half an hour,<br>
and then the water layer was removed from the organic<br>
layer containing the 3-Hydroxy-4-trityloxy butyramide.<br>
The product was a semi-crystalline liquid which was<br>
dried in     vacuo.	Afterwards,  the  excess  trityl<br>
chloride was washed away by tituration with hexane.<br>
The 3-hydroxy"4-trityloxy butyramide (3.61 g, 0.01 moles) was dissolved in 30 mL THF. Fifteen mL of a 13% sodium hypochlorite solution was added and the mixture was stirred vigorously. Next, 1.6 g of sodium hydroxide dissolved in 10 mL of water was added. The reaction was stirred at 55-60oC for eight hours after which time the conversion to 5-trityloxymethyl-2-oxazolidinone was completed as indicated by TLC and IH-NMR spectroscopy.  The organic<br><br>
layer was separated from the aqueous layer and saved. The aqueous layer was extracted three times with THF, The saved organic layer and the THF extracts were combined and then concentrated to remove the solvent. The residue was taken up in dichloromethane and the solution dried over sodium sulfate. Afterwards, the solution was concentrated to remove the solvent and the oxazolidinone was obtained as a white crystalline product (3.4 g, yield 95%). Normally, this crude product did not need further purification.<br>

EXAMPLE 3<br>
This example illustrates the preparation of<br>
a library of substituted 2-oxazolidinones, which are<br>
members of Family II, according to the process of the<br>
present invention. In this example, (S)-5-<br>
trityloxymethyl-2-oxa2olidinone is N-acylated with<br>
2,5-dimethoxyphenacyl bromide, detritylated, and then<br>
acylated with ten different acyl halides or anhydrides<br>
to produce a library of n=10 3-(2,5-<br>
dimethoxyphenacyl) -5- (substituted	methyl) -2-<br>
oxazolidinones.<br>
In the first step (Figure lA) ,  (S)-3-(2,5-dimethocyphenacyl) -5-trityloxymethyl-2-oxazolidinone was  produced  in  a  reaction  comprising  (S)-5-<br><br>
trityloxymethyl-2-oxazolidinone and the aryl bromide: 2,5-dimethoxyphenacyl bromide. To a solution of 3.59 g (10 mmoles) of(S)-5-trityloxymethyl-2-oxa2olidinone (MW 359.2) in 40 mL THF at 4° C, 400 mg (10 mmoles) NaH (MW 24) as a 60% suspension in hexane was added. The reaction mixture was stirred for about 10 minutes under nitrogen at 0o C and then warmed up to room temperature and stirred for an additional two hours. Then, 2.59 g (10 mmoles) of 2-bromo-4 'dimethoxyacetophenone (MW 259.1) was added and the reaction mixture stirred at room temperature for about eight hours. Afterwards, the reaction was quenched by adding 20 mL 20% NH4CI. The organic layer was removed and saved. The aqueous layer was extracted two times with 40 mL aliquots of THF- The THF extracts were combined with the saved organic layer and the mixture dried with 2.5 g anhydrous Na2S04. The mixture was then concentrated in vacuo to provide a crude product. The crude product was purified by flash column chromatography using 4 0% EtOAc:Hexane followed by 60% EtOAc:Hexane. This produced 2.73 g (51% yield) of the (S)-3- (2,5-dimethocyphenacyl)-5-trityloxymethyl-2-oxazolidinone (product)(MW 537.6). The product was compared to the starting material by TLC using 40% EtOAC,Hexane as the solvent. The Rf of the starting material was 0.2 and the Rf of the product was 0.4.<br>
In the second step (Figure IB), the trityl group was removed from the (S) -3- (2,5-dimethocyphenacyl) "5-trityloxymethyl-2-oxazolidinone. To 1.07 g (2.0 mmoles) of (S)-3-(2,5-dimethocyphenacyl) -5-trityloxymethyl-2-oxazolidinone in wet CH2CI2 (8 mL CH2CI2, 1 mL H2O), 0.14 mL CF3CO2H (210 mg, 1.8 mmoles)  (MW 114.02) was added and the<br><br>
reaction mixture stirred for about four hours.<br>
Afterwards, the reaction was quenched by adding 0.2 mL<br>
triethylamine and the reaction mixture concentrated in<br>
vacuo.	The  residue  was  purified  by  flash<br>
chromatography to produce 472 mg (80% yield) of {S)-3-(2,5"dimethocyphenacyl)-5-hydroxymethyl-2-oxazolidinone (product) (MW 295.29). The product was compared to the starting material by TLC using 80% EtOAC: Hexane as the solvent. The Rf of the starting material was 0.7 and the Rf of the product was 0.1.<br>
In the third step (Figure IC), the library<br>
of ten substituted 2-oxazolidinones was produced in a<br>
reaction comprising the (S)-3-(2,5-dimethocyphenacyl)-<br>
5-hydroxymethyl-2-oxazolidinone and the ten different<br>
acetyl chlorides shown in Figure 2. To about 295 mg<br>
(1.0 mraoles) of (S) ^3- (2, 5-dimethocyphenacyl) -5-<br>
hydroxymethyl-2-oxazolidinone in dry CH2CI2 (8 mL<br>
CH2CI2) , 1-0 equiv. (1.1 mmoles) of pyridine was added<br>
and the reaction mixture stirred at room temperature.<br>
To this reaction mixture was added 1.0 equiv. of a<br>
mixture of ten different acetyl chlorides. The<br>
reaction was stirred overnight at room temperature.<br>
Afterwards, TLC of an aliquot indicated that complete<br>
conversion of the (S) -3- (2,5-dimethocyphenacyl) -5-<br>
hydroxymethyl-2-oxazolidinone to (S)-3-(2,5-<br>
dimethocyphenacyl)-5-(substituted	methyl)-2-<br>
oxazolidinone had occurred. Therefore, about 3 mL of 20% NH4CI was added to the reaction mixture and the organic layer removed and saved. The aqueous layer was extracted two times with 40 mL aliquots of CH2Cl2. The CH2Cl2 extracts were combined with the saved organic layer and the mixture dried with 2.5 g anhydrous Na2SO4.  The mixture was then concentrated in<br><br>
vacuo to provide a crude product. The crude product was analyzed by 1H-NMR, 13C NMR, HPLC, and TLC using a EtOAcrhexane (2:1) solvent system.<br>
An  HPLC  profile  of  the   (S)"3-(2,5-<br>
dimethocyphenacyl)-5-(substituted	methyl)-2-<br>
oxazolidinone products made is shown in Figure 3. The products represented by the peaks in the HPLC are shown in Figure 4. This example illustrates the principle of the present invention. As shown by this example, providing n=10 acetyl halides in a single reaction produces 10 (S)-3-(2,5-dimethocyphenacyl)-5-(substituted methyl) -2-oxazolidinone products. If n=10 aryl bromides had been used as well to arylate the N at the 3-position, the process would have generated 100 (S)-3- (substituted) -5-(substituted methyl)-2-oxazolidinone products.<br>
EXAMPLE 4 The  substituted  oxazolidinone  (S)-3- (3,3-dimethyl-2-butone)-5-(4-nitro-benzenesulfonyloxymethyl)-2'-oxazolidinone<br>
,■ <br>
is prepared as follows.<br>
In the first step, (S)-3-(3,3-dimethyl-2-butone) -5-trityloxymethyl-2-oxazolidinone is produced in a reaction comprising (S)-5-trityloxymethyl-2-oxazolidinone and BrCH2COC (CH3)3- To a solution of about   10   mmoles   of   (S)-5-trityloxymethyl-2-<br><br>
oxazolidinone in 40 mL tetrahydrofuran (THF) at 4o c, 10 mmoles NaH as a 60% suspension in hexane is added. The reaction mixture is stirred for about 10 minutes under nitrogen at 0° C and then warmed up to room temperature and stirred for an additional two hours. Then, about 10 mmoles of BrCH2COC (CH3) 3 is added and the reaction mixture stirred at room temperature for about eight hours. Afterwards, the reaction is quenched by adding 20 mL 20% NH4CI. The organic layer is removed and saved. The aqueous layer is extracted two times with 40 mL aliquots of THF. The THF extracts are combined with the saved organic layer and the mixture dried with 2.5 g anhydrous NaaSO4. The mixture is then concentrated in vacuo to provide (S)-3- (3, 3-dimethyl-2-butone) -5-trityloxymethyl-2-oxazolidinone as a crude product. The crude product is purified by flash column chromatography using 40% EtOAc:Hexane followed by 60% EtOAc:Hexane. The product is compared to the starting material by TLC using 40% EtOAC,Hexane as the solvent.<br>
In the second step, the trityl group is<br>
removed from the (S)-3-(3,3-dimethyl-2-butone)-5-<br>
trityloxymethyl-2-oxazolidinone. To about 2.0 mmoles<br>
of the crude product in wet CH2CI2 (8 mL CH2Cl2f 1 mL<br>
H2O), 0.14 mL CF3CO2H (1.8 mmoles) is added and the<br>
reaction mixture stirred for about four hours.<br>
Afterwards, the reaction is quenched by adding 0.2 mL<br>
triethylamine and the reaction mixture concentrated in<br>
vacuo.	The  residue  is  purified  by   flash<br>
chromatography  to  produce   (S)-3-(3,3-dimethyl-2"<br>
butanone) -5-hydroxymethyl-2-oxazolidinone.	The<br>
product can be compared to the starting material by TLC using 80% EtOAC:Hexane as the solvent to determine<br><br>
the yield.<br>
In the third step, the (S)-3-(3,3-dimethyl-2-butone) -5- (4-nitro-benzenesulfonyloxyTnethyl) -2-oxazolidinone is produced in a reaction comprising the (S) -3- (3, 3-dimethyl--2-butanone) -5-hydroxymethyl-2-oxazolidinone and nitrobenzenesulfonyl chloride. To about 1.0 mmoles of the ((S)-3-(3,3-dimethyl-2-butanone)-5-hydroxymethyl-2-oxazolidinone in dry CH2Cl2 (8 mL CH2Cl2) , 1.0 equiv. (1.1 mmoles) of pyridine is added and the reaction mixture stirred at room temperature. To this reaction mixture is added 1.0 equiv. of compound nitrobenzenesulfonyl chloride. The reaction is stirred overnight at room temperature. Afterwards, an aliquot of the reaction is analyzed by TLC to determine whether complete conversion of the (S)-3- (3,3-dimethyl-2-butanone)-5-hydroxymethyl-2-oxazolidinone to the substituted oxazolidinone has occurred. Thereafter, about 3 mL of 20% NH4CI is added to the reaction mixture and the organic layer is removed and saved. The aqueous layer is extracted two times with 40 mL aliquots of CH2Cl2. The CH2Cl2 extracts are combined with the saved organic layer and the mixture is dried with 2.5 g anhydrous Na2S04. The mixture is then concentrated in vacuo to provide a crude product of the substituted oxazolidinone. The crude product is analyzed by 1H-NMR, 13C NMR, HPLC, and TLC using a EtOAcihexane (2:1) solvent system and is further purified by standard chromatography methods.<br>

EXAMPLE 8<br>
The substituted oxazolidinones were tested for antimicrobial activity as follows.<br>
The   following   American   Type   Culture Collection   (ATCC,   10801   University   Boulevard, Manassas,  Virginia)  quality  control  strains  were selected   for   the   initial   screening  of   the antimicrobial   properties   of   the   substituted oxazolidinones   as   suggested   by   the   NCCLS: Enterococcus   faecalis   29212, Escherichia    coli    25922, Pseudomonas     aeruginosa     27853,  and    Staphylococcus aureus  29213.  See, NCCLS document M7-A5. Methods for Dilution  Antimicrobial  Susceptibility  Tests  for Bacteria That Grow Aerobically;  Approved Standard-Fifth Edition, Volume 20,  Number 2.  January 2000, (ISBN  1-56238-394-9)  and  Lorian  V.  Antibiotics. Laboratory Medicine. 4th ed. Baltimore: Williams and Wilkins, pp. 52-111 (1996).  For subsequent testing, the following strains have been used: Staphylococcus<br><br>
aureus NRS4 (992; HIP5836; New Jersey) (Smith et aJ., New Engl. J. Med, 340: 493-501 (1999); Tenover et aJ., J- Clin. Microbiol. 36: 1020-1027 (1998) ), Staphylococcus aureus NRS3 (963sm; HIP5827; Michigan) (Smith et al., ibid.; Tenover et aJ., ibid.), Staphylococcus aureus NRS103 (Becker) (Karakawa and Vann, Sem. Infect. Dis. 4: 285 (1982), Staphylococcus aureus NRS102 (Reynolds) Karakawa and Vann, ibid; McMurray et al., JID 162: 759-762 (1990)), Staphylococcus epidermidis NRSlOl <atcc streptococcus pneumoniae enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus aureus></atcc>
Stock cultures of these strains were obtained by seeding colonies from overnight streak plates (Tryptic Soy Agar II (TSAII) and 5% sheep's blood (SB) agar plates: Becton Dickinson, CA#2211261) into sterile Mueller-Hinton Broth (MHB) (Becton Dickinson, CA#211443) and growing the suspensions to mid-late log phase in 13 mL screw-cap tubes. Glycerol (Sigma, CA#G-6279) was sterilized by autoclaving for 15 minutes at 121oC in 6 mL volumes, and then stored at 2-8°C. This was diluted to 20% in dHzO, and then added 1:1 (250 μL: 250 μL, 10% final glycerol concentration) to the logarithmically growing bacterial suspension of each strain. Tubes were frozen and stored at -70°C. Purity of the stock cultures was tested by thawing one tube of each strain in a water bath at 37°C and plating them on TSAII with 5% SB. Plates were incubated overnight at 37°C and colonies were examined for morphology. Growth curves and approximate CFU,mL were also obtained.<br><br>
DMSO susceptibility determinations were performed as follows. DMSO (Alfa Aesar, CA#22914) was diluted to 2x the final starting concentration of 20% in MHB, pH 7.36 (this was the consistent pH value of MHB)(should be between 7.2-7.4 according to NCCLS). Two-fold serial dilutions were performed in 15 mL conical tubes and poured into sterile reservoirs. Using an 2-channel micropipetman, 50 μL from each reservoir was transferred to every well in the corresponding column (1-11) of a sterile 96-well, U-bottom microplate (Nalge Nunc, Intl., CA#262162). As a positive growth control, 50 μL of MHB alone was added to each well of Column 12. Bacteria were grown overnight on TSAII + 5%SB, and 3-4 colonies were seeded into 6 mL of sterile MHB in 13 mL screw cap tubes. Tubes were grown at 35°C to mid-log phase, and were diluted to an optical density of 0.12 at 625nm (or approx. 1x105 CFU,mL), using 0.9% sterile saline. This solution was further diluted 1:100 with 0.9% sterile saline (1x105 CFU,mL), and 50 pL was added to each well for a final inoculum of 1x105 CFU,mL. As a negative growth control, well H12 was inoculated only with 0.9% sterile saline. The plate was tightly fitted with sealing tape (Corning Costar, CA#3095) and was incubated for a period of 18 hours at 35°C, after which growth was observed. 2.5% DMSO was determined to be the smallest concentration of DMSO to exhibit no visual effects on bacterial growth as compared with the positive controls for all strains tested. This was confirmed by performing colony counts to assess cell viability in the presence of DMSO. For each strain, 10 pL was removed from one of the inoculated wells  containing  2.5%,  0.15%,  and 0% DMSO  (after<br><br>
mixing)• This was diluted 1:100000 in sterile 0.9% DMSO, plated on TSAII + 5%SB, and grown overnight at 35-oC. Plates were then observed for differences in the number of viable colonies (theoretically, each colony arises from a single cell) based on the varying concentrations of DMSO.  No differences were observed.<br>
High purity substituted oxazolidinones prepared according to the method of the present invention and a ZYVOX standard (ZYVOX is a trade name for linezolid available from Pharmacia Corporation) were provided by Synthon Corporation, Monmouth Junction, NJ. Compounds were dissolved at 10 mg,mL in DMSO, as after a dilution of approx. 39.0 to reach the desired final starting concentration of 256ug,ml, the concentration of DMSO is approximately 2.5%. Compounds were then stored at room temperature (25oC C) in the dark.<br>
Antimicrobial susceptibility screening was as follows. All compounds were initially screened for activity in duplicate at 256 ug,mL (2.5% DMSO), including ZYVOX, the positive control for antimicrobial activity. A single well of bacterially inoculated 2.5% DMSO served as a positive control for bacterial growth, while a well of DMSO inoculated with of 50 uL of sterile 0.9% saline served as a negative growth control. Controls were prepared on every microplate; so that 46 was the maximum number of compounds that were screened per plate. Broth was pipetted into sterile microcentrifuge tubes, to which the compounds were then added (1:19.53 dilution or 2x final concentration) . Each tube was vortexed, and 50 pL was immediately transferred to the microplate wells for each strain.  Solubility was assessed by visual<br><br>
observation. MB (medium broth solubility) was recorded if the solution appeared only slightly cloudy. LB (low broth solubility) was recorded if the solution was extremely cloudy, and especially if larger, clumpy precipitates formed. Bacteria were grown as described above, although absorbance was measured at 650 nm and bacteria were diluted to an initial OD of 0.12-0.15. Bacteria were then further diluted 1:100 with 0.9% sterile saline. Within 15 minutes of this final dilution, 50 yL of this suspension was added to each well for a final volume of 0.1 L, and a final bacterial concentration of 1x105 CFU,mL (except for the negative control well). Plates were grown as above and all observations were recorded.<br>
Compounds exhibiting activity at this concentration were then screened for their MICs (minimum inhibitory concentration) in duplicate, at concentrations ranging from 256-0.25 μg,mL (columns 1-11) using the broth microdilution method. Two-fold dilutions were obtained using an 8-channel micropipetman and tips were changed between each column transfer, after mixing 10 times and expelling the maximum amount of fluid. The MIC was defined as the lowest concentration of test compound that inhibited visible growth after a period of 18 hours incubation at 35oC C. Bacteria were prepared, and the microwell plates were incubated as described above. In addition, bacteria were routinely sampled before addition to the wells. From the pre-well concentration, samples were diluted 1:200 with 0.9% sterile saline. At this concentration, 100 μL was plated and the remaining sample was diluted 1:10.  100<br><br>
μL of this was then also spread-plated onto TSAII + 5% SB and grown overnight at 35oC C.  Colonies were counted and multiplied by the  dilution  factor  to  obtain starting CFU,mL.  As a positive MIC control, ZYVOX was tested in parallel for each strain, and the dilution of  5%  {2x final concentration)  DMSO served as a positive growth control.   To control for variation between the volume transferred by each tip of the 8-channel micropipetman,  5%  (2x  final concentration) DMSO was added to column 12 using the micropipetman. All wells, but that of the negative control (H12), were inoculated with the same bacterial suspension resulting in a final starting concentration of 1x105 CFU,mL.  The negative control was inoculated with 0.9% sterile saline.<br>
At this time, a total of 1625 substituted oxazolidinones have been successfully screened for activity at 256 pg,mL (Compounds 1422, 1474, 147$, 1595 were absent) . Of these, 71 were tested against Staphylococcus aureus (Gram positive), 60 were tested against Enterococcus faecalis (Gram positive), and one compound tested against Escherichia call (Gram negative) have proven effective with MICs at or below 256 μg,mL.<br>
Tables 1 and 2 show the antimicrobial activity for several of the substituted oxazolidinones. Table 1 further shows that several were also able to inhibit the growth of myeloid, erythroid, and megakaryocytic cells. Table 3 shows several substituted oxazolidinones which have been found to be particularly antimicrobial. In general, many of the substituted oxazolidinones were as effective as ZYVOX.  Thus, the results show that many<br><br>
