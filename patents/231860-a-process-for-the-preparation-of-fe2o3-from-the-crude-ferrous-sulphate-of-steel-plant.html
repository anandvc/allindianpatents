				<td>The present invention relates to a method for the preparation of y-Fe2O3 from crude Fe(II)<br>
sulphate waste.<br>
Ferrous sulphate is obtained as a waste from the pickle liquor of steel plants. It is<br>
estimated that about 2000 tonnes of ferrous sulphate is obtained annually from pickling vats<br>
of Rourkela Steel Plant alone. A lot of ferrous sulphate is also produced by the Indian Rare<br>
Earths Ltd. as a waste, while preparing titanium dioxide from ilmenite and disposal or<br>
utilisation of such waste has attracted considerable attention throughout the world. Ferrous<br>
sulphate solution could also be obtained by dissolving the waste iron scraps from<br>
fabrication industries in sulphuric acid. In RRL, Bhubaneswar a number of possibilities<br>
have been considered to utilise these wastes.<br>
Single phase y-Fe2C3 is an important material used as recording medium in<br>
applications such as magnetic tapes and other information storage devises like drums and<br>
discs. Its use in ferrite compositions is also well known. It is a ferrimagnetic compound with<br>
inverse spinel structures in which iron(III) cations occupy both tetrahedral and octahedral<br>
sites.<br>
Reference may be made to Magnetic Oxide, Vol.2, published by Wiley -<br>
Interscience, New York, 1975 wherein D.J. Craik described the commercial synthesis of FeaOs from synthetic goethite (a- FeOOH). It involves dehydration of goethite to areduction<br>
to Fe and final re-oxidation to -<br>
Reference may by made to J. Mater. Sci., 9 (1974) 430 wherein V. Rao etal.<br>
reported the preparation of y-FeaOa from iron(II) carboxylate, using iron(II) oxalate<br>
dihydrate as the starting material.<br>
Reference may be made to Bull. Mater. Sci., 3a (1981) 201 wherein K. Shesan et al<br>
also prepared y-Fe2O3 using iron(II) oxalate dihydrate as the starting material.<br>
Reference may be made to Thermochim. acta. 112 (1987) 231 wherein A.<br>
Venkataraman et al reported the synthesis of y-Fe2C3 from thermal decomposition of<br>
ferrous fumarate.<br>
Reference may be made to Thermochim. Acta, 115 (1987) 215, wherein A.<br>
Venkataraman et al reported the synthesis of y-Fe2O3 by thermal decomposition of ferrous<br>
succinate.<br>
Reference may be made to J. Therm. Anal. 35 (1989) 2115, wherein A.<br>
Venkataraman et al reported the synthesis of Y-Fe2O3 by thermal decomposition of ferrous<br>
tartarate.<br>
Reference may also be made to Thermochim. Acta. 125 (1988) 173, wherein M.M.<br>
Rahman et al reported the synthesis of y-Fe2O3 by thermal decomposition of ferrous<br>
malonate.<br>
The drawbacks of the processes developed are that they used pure chemicals, hence<br>
the products are costly. But in the present invention a metallurgical industry waste is used<br>
as raw material and the steps involved in the process do not require any sophisticated<br>
technology.<br>
A method is developed for the preparation of single phase y-Fe2O3 which finds use<br>
as magnetic material in recording devices.<br>
Ferrous sulphate is obtained as a waste in steel plants, as well as in synthetic rutile<br>
industry. It can be prepared by dissolving iron scraps of fabrication industries in dil<br>
sulphuric acid. However the present work has been carried out on the waste ferrous sulphate<br>
obtained from the pickling vats of steel plant. The ferrous sulphate is dissolved in dil FfeSC^<br>
in the presence of a small amount of iron powder, filtered and diluted with half its volume<br>
of ethyl alcohol to obtain re-crystallised iron (II) sulphate heptahydrate in the pure form.<br>
Solution of this ferrous sulphate is neutralised and then treated with NaOH solution<br>
(10 % more than stoichiometrically required amount) and subjected to hydrothermal<br>
agitation at temperatures ranging from 50 to 80°C along with air bubbling for 6h. The<br>
precipitate of iron oxyhydroxide is filtered, washed, dried and identified by XRD. After<br>
roasting this material at 350°C, the product is identified by XRD to be single phase y-<br>
Fe203.<br>
The novelty of the invention is that it provides a simple and precise method for preparation<br>
of a value added product i.e. y-Fe2O3 from waste ferrous sulphate.<br>
The main objective of this invention is to develop a method for the preparation of y-<br>
FeaOs from ferrous sulphate obtained as waste in metallurgical industry.<br>
Another objective of this invention is to solve the disposal problem of an industrial<br>
waste.<br>
Still another objective of this invention is to decrease environmental pollution.<br>
Yet another objective of this invention is reduction of y-Fe2Os import.<br>
Yet another objective of this invention is to prepare pure FeSC^. VFkO after the first step of<br>
this process.<br>
Yet another objective of this invention is to prepare iron oxy hydroxide, after the<br>
second step of this process, which can adsorb heavy metal pollutants from industrial<br>
effluents and also serve as a starting material for the preparation of ferrites and pigments.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for the preparation of y-FeaOa from<br>
crude iron (II) sulphate waste, which comprises treating the iron (II) sulphate waste with<br>
dilute sulphuric acid in the presence of a small amount of iron scrap or powder, filtering and<br>
re-crystallising the FeSO4.7H2O from the above said filtrate by adding ethyl alcohol,<br>
oxidative hydrolysing the above said re-crystallised iron(II) sulphate solution by using air as<br>
oxidant and sodium hydroxide solution as precipitant, at a temperature ranging from 40 to<br>
100 ° C to obtain iron oxy-hydroxide followed by calcination at a temperature ranging<br>
between 320 -360°C for a period of 5-7 hrs to obtain the desired yhi<br>
an embodiment of the present invention the temperature used in oxidative hydrolysis of<br>
re-crystallised iron(II) sulphate solution is preferably in the range of 50-80° C<br>
The essential steps involved in the process are as follows :<br>
(a) Treatment of FeSO4 obtained from the pickling vats of steel plants with dil FSC in the<br>
presence of a small amount of iron scrap/powder.<br>
(b) Re-crystallisation of FeSO4.7H2O from the above ferrous sulphate solution by the<br>
addition of ethyl alcohol.<br>
(c) Preparation of iron oxy-hydroxide from a solution of the re-crystallised ferrous<br>
sulphate by oxidative hydrolysis using air as oxidant and sodium hydroxide as<br>
precipitant.<br>
(d) Wet grinding of the material, prepared as above in acetone medium followed by vacuum<br>
drying.<br>
(e) Calcination of the material at 350°C for 6h to prepare 76263<br>
