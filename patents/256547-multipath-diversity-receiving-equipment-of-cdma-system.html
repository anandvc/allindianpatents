				<td>The present invention relates to multipath diversity receiving equipment of CDMA system.<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to the receiver techniques in Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) system, Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA) system, and Time Division Synchronous CDMA (TDS-CDMA) system, and particularly to the base band multipath diversity receiving equipment of broadband CDMA system.<br>
Background Art<br>
In CDMA system, multipath fading channels are formed because signals arrive at the receiving end in different propagation paths with different propagation delays, at the same time, the low correlation among different phase errors of signal code sequences causes that the multipath delay components over a chip period are irrelative, which performs detachable paths in the model, so the multipath diversity receiving equipment, i.e. RAKE receiver, is usually adopted in CDMA system for receiving signals.<br>
The RAKE receiver implements the receipt of user signals through combining the multipath after the descrambling and the despreading the multipath with different phases of certain user separately. The principle of the RAKE receiver is as shown in figure 1, comprising a sample quantization device 110, a multipath search subsystem 120, a multipath assignment subsystem 130, n delay phase locked loop subsystems, n demodulation subsystems, n channel estimation subsystems and multipath combination subsystem 150. The sample signals obtained by sampling and quantizing 110 the signal 200 sent by the mobile user device are sent to the multipath search subsystem 120 and the multipath assignment subsystem 130 for phase search of user multipath,'and then the corresponding multipath phases are assigned to the<br>
demodulation subsystem 1, the demodulation subsystem 2,	, the demodulation subsystem<br>
n, and the delay phase locked loop subsystem 1, the delay phase locked loop subsystem<br><br>
2,	, the delay phase locked loop subsystem n. Each demodulation subsystem and delay<br>
phase locked loop subsystem are responded to a multipath phase. Based on the different multipath phases, sample signals output by the sample quantization device 110 are descrambled and despreaded by each demodulation subsystem, and symbols signals obtained by descrambling and despreading are respectively sent to the channel estimation subsystem 1,<br>
the channel estimation subsystem 2,	, the channel estimation subsystem w for estimating<br>
the channel, and symbol signals after the signal are sent to the multipath combination subsystem 150 for multipath combination, then the combined signal 220 is sent to the following subsystem for processing. Each delay phase locked loop subsystem carries on the descrambling, the dispreading and the energy summation for the sample signals output by the sample quantization device 110 according to the corresponding multipath phases and multipath phases with forward-and-back 1/2 chip shift, and judges whether the multipath phase corresponding to the delay phase locked loop subsystem keeps fixed, or slips forward or back according to the difference between the energy of the corresponding multipath phase and the energy of the multipath phase with forward-and-back 1/2 chip shift, and sends the result to the multipath distribution subsystem 130 as the basis of distributing the multipath phases. In such a way the whole receipt processing of the RAKE receiver is finished.<br>
In the traditional RAKE receiver, the multipath search subsystem, the demodulation subsystem and the delay phase locked loop subsystem have the structures independent of each other, which are shown as in figure 2. For the demodulation subsystem, after the sample signals obtained by sampling and quantizing 110 the signal 200 sent by the mobile device are descrambled and despread 140 and symbol accumulated 141, the result is sent to the channel estimation subsystem 149.    For the multipath search subsystem, after sample signals are descrambled and despread 142, symbol accumulated 143, and energy accumulated 146, the result is sent to the multipath assignment subsystem 130. For the delay phase locked loop subsystem, after sample signals are descrambled and despread 144, symbol accumulated 145, and energy accumulated 147, the result is sent to the multipath assignment subsystem 130.<br>
As above described, the multipath search subsystem, the demodulation subsystem and the delay phase locked loop subsystem in the traditional RAKE receiver adopt the devices independent of each other, wherein each demodulation subsystem and each delay phase<br>
locked loop subsystem use a set of corresponding devices, which causes a bigger waste in hardware resource. In order to reduce the hardware resource and realize Time Division Multiplexing (TMD) multipath parallel demodulation, the method of buffering sample signals and code information was brought forward, and at the same time the multipath phase corresponding to the delay phase locked loop and its shifted multipath phase are seen as the multipath to be parallel demodulated together. However, the method only combined the demodulation subsystem and the delay phase locked loop subsystem without the multipath search subsystem, while the structure of the delay phase locked loop subsystem is similar to that of the multipath search subsystem, thereby the hardware structure was not truly simplified with some repeats, which also caused the waste in hardware resource.<br>
Additionally, the traditional RAKE receiver is a signal processing equipment of 1-dimension operation for sample signals and code words according to the features of RAKE receiver. But with the development of the CDMA system, specially for the problem of intersymbol interference, the method of multi-user combination detection is needed to be introduced to reduce the intersymbol interference among users to improve the performance and the capability of the system, and the combination detection is realized by performing n-dimension matrix operation for the sample signals input by the antenna and the code information. Therefore, the traditional RAKE receiver can not support the n-dimension matrix operation function needed by combination detection, needing an individual device to realize the n-dimension matrix operation needed by the combination detection, which causes the addition of the hardware resource, and the increase of the cost of the realization of the hardware device.<br>

Preferred Embodiment of the Invention<br>
The technical solution of the present invention will be described further in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
Figures 1 and 2 present the schematic diagram of the RAKE receiver of the prior art, which have been explained in Background, not giving any unnecessary details here.<br>
The base principle of the present invention is as follows: the continuous demodulation for multiple offsets of search window when performing multipath search is regarded   as the demodulation for the multiple multipaths with phase shift of 1/2 chip and continuous phase; the delay phase locked loop is regarded as the demodulation of three multipaths with phase shift of 1/2 chip. In such a way, the multipath demodulation, multipath search and delay phase locked loop are all seen as the mulitpath demodulation, only the energy accumulation is needed after the demodulation for multipath phase of the multipath search and delay phase locked loop. Based on above principle, the multipath demodulation, multipath search and delay phase locked loop can be combined through the hardware, and at the same time the demodulation processing of the multipath demodulation, multipath search and delay phase locked loop are seen as an aggregation of the demodulation of multiple multipaths to get rid of the repetition parts of demodulation processing of the multipath search and delay phase locked loop.<br>
In the CDMA system, provided that the number of the samples of each chip of system input data is 2k, and input sequence is<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
and the<br>
sequence of the code words of the user is:  <br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
 Provided that the<br>
multipath phase of one multipath is t, and <br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
then the first reading<br>
data are: <br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
, in such a way, the demodulation result of p data<br>
of each multipath is:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
From above, the demodulation operation of a multipath can be seen as the operation of 1 -dimension matrix of the antenna data and 1 -dimension matrix of the code word data, therefore, if the multipath demodulation, multipath search and delay phase locked loop are seen as the demodulation operation for the aggregation of all the multipaths, m x « matrix can be used to represent m multipaths, and each multipath has n sample data for demodulation operation with n code word data. Then by controlling the demodulation operation, all the multipath demodulations are realized, and at the same time it can be extended as matrix operation used in multiple-user detection.<br>
The structure of the multipath diversity receiving equipment of CDMA system of the present invention is illustrated in figure 3, including a sample quantization device 1 10, a sample data storage device 300, a code data storage device 310, a mulitpath resource management device 350, a code resource management device 320, a demodulation control device 340, a correlation demodulation device 330, a channel estimation unit 370,an energy accumulation device 360 and an energy analysis processing device 380.<br>
After the signal 200 received by the receiving antenna passes through the sample quantization device 1 10, the sample signal is output to the sample data storage device 300. The mulitpath resource management device 350 provides the code information to the code resource management device 320, and the code word data are produced in the code resource management device 320 and stored in the code data storage device 3 10; at the same time the mulitpath resource management device 350 provides the multipath information to the demodulation control device 340.    The demodulation control device 340 controls to read the sample data and the code word data from the sample data storage device 300 and the code data storage device 310, and outputs them to the correlation demodulation device 330 for processing, and the correlation demodulation device 330, based on the information output by the demodulation control device 340, outputs the result of demodulation to the channel estimation unit 370 for channel estimation, then the demodulation function is completed; or outputs the result to the energy accumulation device 360 for energy accumulation, and then outputs the accumulation result to the energy analysis processing device 380 for further processing to complete the multipath search function and the delay phase locked loop<br>
function, and the result from the energy analysis processing device 380 is feedbacked to the mulitpath resource management device 350, then the whole receiving processing of the RAKE receiver is completed.<br>
In the CDMA system, for a base station, the samples obtained by sampling and quantizing the signals received by the receiving antenna includes all the information of users, and for mobile holding device, it includes the information of all the channels sent by the base station.<br>
The following is the description of each component of the present invention with reference to the figures 4-7.<br>
In the equipment of the present invention, the sample data storage device 300 is mainly used to store all the antenna data for multipath demodulation, the storage contents of which are<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein, each row is corresponded to the input sequence of an<br><br>
antenna, i.e. n represents the number of the antennas; each data is corresponded to a sample data. For a base station system, N 1 -dimension matrixes are stored in the sample data storage device 300, i.e. n = N ; for a handset system, 1 1 -dimension matrix is stored in the sample data storage device 300, i.e., n = 1 .<br>
All the code word data needed by multipath demodulation are stored in the code data storage<br>
device 310, the storage contents of which are<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
row is corresponded to the code word sequence of a user (channel), i.e. m represents the number of users (channels); each data is corresponded to a code word data. For a base station system and a handset system, M 1 -dimension matrixes are stored in the code data storage device 310, corresponding to M users/channels, i.e. m = M.<br>
The main functions of the code resource management device 320 are: collecting the code information of users (channels) corresponding to each multipath output by the mulitpath resource management device 350, and generating the corresponding scrambling and channel code according to this information, then operating the scrambling and channel code to get the<br>
final code word data of users (channels), and outputting them to the code data storage device 310.<br>
The correlation demodulation device 330 is controlled by the demodulation control device 340, and implements the matrix operation for the data from the sample data storage device 300 and the code data storage device 310, and accumulates to get a complete symbol data to realize all the multipath demodulation operations. If the result of demodulation operation is the complete symbol data of the multipath demodulation of the multipah search and the delay phase locked loop, it will be output to the energy accumulation device 360; if it is the normal complete symbol data of multipath demodulation, it will be output to the channel estimation unit 370.<br>
Figure 4 is a schematic view of the correlation demodulation device 330, including the module for realizing m x n correlation operation matrix and the module for realizing m x N accumulation matrix, wherein the module for realizing m x n correlation operation matrix is used to complete the correlation demodulation operation between n sample data of each multipath and the corresponding n code word data for m multipaths; the module for realizing m x N accumulation matrix is used to finish the accumulation process of the m results of parallel correlation operation of multipath phase for N times; the number of multipaths that each row matrix can support is N; wherein m is the number of the rows of the correlation operation matrix, i.e. the number of multipaths to be parallel processed by the correlation demodulation matrix; n is the number of the columns of the correlation operation matrix, i.e. the length of sample data or code word data for one correlation operation of each multipath of the correlation demodulation matrix.; N, the column number of accumulation matrix, is the maximum number of the multipaths supported by each row of the correlation demodulation matrix, which is equal to n multiplying the number of clock periods in 1 chip, presenting that all multipaths have completed an correlation operation of n sample data and n code word data, i.e. a cycle period of a correlation operation processing.<br>
Further, the module for realizing m x n correlation operation matrix can be m correlation operators of order n. In the Time Division Multiplexing ( TDM) mode, in one clock period, the module for realizing m x n correlation operation matrix completes the correlation operation of n antenna sample data of a group of m parallel multipath phases and the<br>
corresponding n code word data of users (channels), then sends the result to the module for realizing mx N accumulation matrix, and the correlation operation result is accumulated with the previous accumulation result of a certain column in the accumulation matrix, and the result is stored in the original position; in next clock period, the module for realizing m x n correlation operation matrix completes the correlation operation of next group of m parallel multipath phases, and sends the result to the module for realizing mxN accumulation matrix, and the correlation operation result is accumulated with the previous accumulation result of a certain column in the accumulation matrix, and the result is stored in the original position. In such a way, the correlation operation and accumulation of a group of m multipath phases can be finished in each clock period of a cycle period, and the maximum number of the multipaths supported by each row correlation demodulation matrix that can be performed is up to N, then next cycle period repeats.<br>
In matrix operation of the combination detection, the real matrix operation is processed in the module for realizing mxn correlation operation matrix, where mxn correlation operation matrix completes the matrix operation between mxn matrixes, for which many times of matrix operations are needed, now the corresponding module for realizing m x N accumulation matrix can work as intermediate data buffer matrix.<br>
The demodulation control device 340 groups and reorganizes the phase offset information of all the mulipaths output by the multipath resource management device 350 to generate read addresses of the sample data memory device 300 and the code data memory device 310, and to control the output of the sample data memory device 300 and the code data memory device 310; at the same time, groups and reorganizes the symbol length information of these multipaths and outputs them to the correlation demodulation device 330 to control the module for realizing m x N accumulation matrix for processing the symbol accumulation.    Figure 5 is schematic diagram of the demodulation control device 340.    The demodulation control device 340 receives the multipath phase matrix output by the mulitpath resource management device 350, and reads one column (corresponding to m multipath phases) of the multipath phase matrix in each clock period, then decomposes parallel m multipath phases read in each clock period, wherein phase offsets of the multipath decomposed are sent to the sample data memory device 300 and the code data storage device 310 for obtaining the antenna sample<br>
data and user (channel) code word data needed; the symbol length information of each multipath decomposed is sent to the correlation demodulation device 330 for accumulating the result of the matrix operation to finish the accumulation of the symbol data of each multipath demodulation.<br>
Figure 6 is schematic view of the storage of multipath phases reorganized by the mulitpath resource management device 350, and all the multipath phases are stored in the multipath phase matrix in matrix form. The size of the multipath phase matrix is related to the number of the rows of the correlation operation matrix in the correlation demodulation device 330 and the number of the multipaths supported by each row, so the multipath phase matrix is a m x N 2-dimension matrix. In each clock period, the demodulation control device 340 reads multipath phases of one column of the multipath phase matrix, and outputs them to the correlation demodulation device 330 for processing, so the correlation demodulation device 330 can support mxN multipath phases.<br>
The main functions of the multipath resource management device 350 are: decomposing all kinds of the multipath search, multipath demodulation, and delay phase locked loop into the aggregation of multipath, then reorganizing all the mulipath information, and sorting all the mulipath information according to users or channels, and then sending all kinds of information of these multipaths to the demodulation control device 340 and sending the code information of users (channels) corresponding to all the multipaths to the code resource management device 320. Additionally, for the multipath information and multipath slip information reported by the energy analysis processing device 380, the mulitpath resource management device 350 judges whether it needs to replace the original multipath. Figure 7 is schematic diagram of the multipath resource management device 350.    First, the multipath resource management device 350 decomposes the multipath search, multipath demodulation and delay phase locked loop into the multipath demodulation aggregation of all kinds of multipath phases; groups the reorganized multipath phases, according to the number of the rows of correlation operation matrix and the number of multipaths supported by each row, into a m x N 2-dimension matrix stored in a m x N 2-dimension multipath phase matrix; then outputs the m x N 2-dimension multipath phase matrix to the demodulation control device 340. When decomposing the multipath search, multipath demodulation and delay<br>
phase locked loop into the multipath demodulation aggregation of all kinds of multipath phases, the multipath resource management device 350 extracts the corresponding user (channel) code information of the multipath search, multipath demodulation and delay phase locked loop, and sends it to the code resource management device 320. The dashed line in the figure represents a processing in which the multipath demodulation aggregation generated by the multipath resource management device 350, through the processing of the correlation demodulation device 330 and the energy accumulation device 360, reports the corresponding information to the energy analysis processing device 380, and a processing in which the energy analysis processing device 380 analyzes and selects the multipath phase with the largest multipath search energy, judges the slip direction of the multipath demodulation phase according to the energy reported by delay phase locked loop, and then reports to the multipath resource management device 350. After receiving these information, the multipath resource management device 350 does the phase judgment and analysis with the existing multipath demodulation phase, and finally generates the multipath phases for next multipath demodulation, which, with the multipath search and delay phase locked loop, is decomposed into the multipath demodulation aggregation of all kinds of multipath phases.<br>
The valid multipath data demodulated by the correlation demodulation device 330 is output to the channel estimation unit 370 to store, and the data is estimated and restored.<br>
The energy accumulation device 360 sums the energy of multipath data related to the multipath search and delay phase locked loop demodulated by the correlation demodulation device 330, and then the summation is sent to the energy analysis processing device 380 for energy judgment and analysis.<br>
