The meter cable is mounted to the revolving shaft by inserting and fitting the shaft portion into the fitting hole while performing centering between the shaft portion of the inner cable and the fitting hole of the revolving shaft in the tapered inner wall portion (for example, see Patent Document<br>
1) .<br>
[0003]<br>
[Patent Document 1] JP-UM-A-7-12971 [Disclosure of the Invention] [Problems that the Invention is to Solve]<br>
[0004]<br>
However, in the meter cable mounting structure in the related art, it is not easy to align the shaft portion of the inner cable and the fitting hole of the revolving shaft in phase when performing the centering of the shaft portion of the inner cable and the fitting hole of the revolving shaft in the tapered inner wall portion on the side of the revolving shaft.<br>
[0005]<br>
Therefore, there arises a problem such that it is necessary to mount the meter cable while paying attention to the phase of the shaft portion of the inner cable and the fitting hole of the revolving shaft, and hence time and efforts are required for the mounting operation.<br>
[0006]<br><br>
In order to solve the problem described above, it is an object of the present invention to provide a meter cable mounting structure in which a shaft portion of an inner cable and a fitting hole of a revolving shaft can easily be aligned in phase, whereby mounting operation of the meter cable can be facilitated. [Means for Solving the Problems]<br>
[0007]<br>
In order to achieve the object described above, the invention according to Claim 1 is a meter cable mounting structure including a meter cable having an inner cable with shaft portions of square shape in cross section at ends thereof therein, the inner cable being rotatably stored in the meter cable; and a revolving shaft having a fitting hole of square shape in cross section that corresponds to the shaft portion of the inner cable at the end thereof and a tapered inner wall portion provided in a periphery of an open end of the fitting hole, the tapered inner wall portion being reduced in diameter gradually toward the open end, in which the meter cable is mounted to the revolving shaft by fitting the shaft portion of the inner cable into the fitting hole of the revolving shaft, characterized in that the tapered inner wall portion of the revolving shaft is formed with a guide portion for guiding the shaft portion of the inner cable to the fitting hole of the revolving shaft.<br><br>
[0008]<br>
In addition to the structure of the invention according to Claim 1, the invention according to Claim 2 is characterized in that the guide portion is a guide projection formed at least on one side of the fitting hole out of four sides of square shape in cross section thereof from a substantially center position between adjacent corners toward the tapered inner wall portion.<br>
[0009]<br>
In addition to the structure of the invention according to Claim 1, the invention according to Claim 3 is characterized in that the guide portion is a guide wall portion extending along an inner wall surface on one side of the fitting hole of square shape in cross section toward the tapered inner wall portion side and continuing to the tapered inner wall portion, [Advantage of the Invention]<br>
[0010]<br>
According to the meter cable mounting structure stated in Claim 1, since the guide portion for guiding the shaft portion of the inner cable into the fitting hole of the revolving shaft is provided on the tapered inner wall portion of the revolving shaft, the shaft portion of the inner cable is guided to the open end of the fitting hole of the revolving shaft along the guide portion, and a distal end of the shaft portion of the inner cable can be aligned with the fitting hole<br><br>
in phase at the open end, whereby the mounting operation of the meter cable can be facilitated.<br>
[0011]<br>
According to the meter cable mounting structure stated in Claim 2, since the guide portion is the guide projection provided on at least one side of the fitting hole out of the four sides of square shape in cross section thereof from substantially the center position between adjacent corners toward the tapered inner wall portion, the shaft portion of the inner cable can be guided to the open end of the fitting hole of the revolving shaft along the guide projection, whereby the distal end of the shaft portion of the inner cable can be aligned with the fitting hole easily in phase.<br>
[0012]<br>
According to the meter cable mounting structure stated in Claim 3, since the guide portion is the guide wall portion extending along the inner wall surface on one side of the fitting hole of square shape in cross section toward the tapered inner wall portion side and continuing to the tapered inner wall portion, the shaft portion of the inner cable can be guided easily to the open end of the fitting hole of the revolving shaft along the wall surface of the guide wall portion, whereby the distal end of the shaft portion of the inner cable and the fitting hole can be aligned easily in phase. [Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention]<br><br>

The drawings are to be viewed in the orientation in which reference numerals are seen in the right way.<br><br>
[0014] (First Embodiment)<br>
Referring now to Fig. 1 to Fig. 6, a meter cable mounting structure according to the first embodiment of the present invention will be described. In this embodiment, a structure of a mounting portion between a meter cable and a gear case for detecting rotation of a camshaft of an engine is taken as an example.<br>
[0015]<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, a motorcycle 1 in which the meter cable mounting structure of the present invention is employed will be described first. The motorcycle 1 includes a main frame lb extending from a head pipe la rearward and downward, and a pivot plate 1c bent downward is formed at a rear end of the main frame lb.<br>
[0016]<br>
The head pipe la supports a front wheel 2 via a front fork 2a, and the pivot plate lc supports a rear wheel 3 via a swing arm 3a. A meter box 10 in which a speed meter, a tachometer and the like are stored is mounted to a top bridge of the front fork 2a via a stay 10a extending toward the front.<br>
[0017]<br>
An engine 4 is mounted to the main frame lb and the pivot plate lc, and the camshaft (not shown) is provided on a cylinder head 6 of the engine 4 in a state in which an axial line is<br><br>
oriented in the widthwise direction of the vehicle. As shown in Fig. 2, a cam-driven sprocket 7 is mounted to an end of the camshaft in a state of being covered by a cam sprocket cover 11 fixed to the cylinder head 6 with tightening bolts 11a,<br>
[0018]<br>
By laying a roller chain 9 across the cam-driven sprocket 7 and a cam-drive sprocket 8 mounted to a crankshaft 5, the revolving speed of the crankshaft 5 is reduced to half and transmitted to the cam-driven sprocket 7 via the cam-drive sprocket 8 and the roller chain 9.<br>
[0019]<br>
As shown in Fig. 2, a gear case 15 for deriving a rotating power for the tachometer in the meter box 10 is fixed to an outer surface of the cam sprocket cover 11 with tightening bolts 17.<br>
[0020]<br>
Stored in the gear case 15 are an input gear 14 connected to the camshaft via a joint or the like and a pinion (revolving shaft) 13 as an output gear that meshes the input gear 14.<br>
[0021]<br>
By mounting one end of a meter cable 12 to the pinion 13 and mounting the other end thereof to the revolving shaft (not shown) of the tachometer in the meter box 10, the rotating power from the camshaft is transmitted to the tachometer via the input gear 14, the pinion 13 and the meter cable 12.<br><br>
[0022]<br>
The meter cable 12 includes an inner cable 18 formed by winding a plurality of wire rods on a core wire such as a stainless wire or the like and an outer tube 19 for covering the inner cable 18 as shown in Fig. 2.<br>
[0023]<br>
The inner cable 18 is rotatable in the outer tube 19, and shaft portions 20 of square shape in cross section are provided at both ends so as to project from end surfaces of the outer tube 19. The shaft portion 20 at one end is mounted to the pinion 13 and the shaft portion 20 at the other end is mounted to the revolving shaft of the tachometer.<br>
[0024]<br>
The outer tube 19 is adapted to be fitted into an opening 15a of the gear case 15 at one end thereof, and is provided on an outer periphery of the fitting portion with an engaging projection 22 that engages with an engaging hole 21 provided on a wall portion of the gear case 15 as an example of coming-off-prevention and detent means for the meter cable 12 . The engaging projection 22 is provided so as to be capable of resiliently deforming radially inwardly of the mater cable 12 via a notch 23 and project radially outwardly from an outer peripheral surface of the outer tube 19, and an inclined surface 24 that inclines radially inwardly of the meter cable 12 is formed on an outer surface of the engaging projection 22.<br><br>
[0025]<br>
As shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, the pinion 13 is formed with a large-diameter portion 25 which is long in the axial direction, a medium-diameter portion 26 and a small-diameter portion 27 which are relatively short, in sequence along the axial direction. A pin portion 29 which is to be rotatably inserted into a pin hole 28 formed on a bottom of the gear case 15 is concentrically formed on an end surface of the large-diameter portion 25. The large-diameter portion 25 is formed with teeth 13a to be meshed with teeth 14a of the input gear 14 is on an outer peripheral surface of the end portion thereof on the side of the pin portion 29.<br>
[0026]<br>
The small-diameter portion 27 is rotatably inserted into a bush 30 whose outer peripheral portion is supported by the gear case 15. The bush 30 is arranged substantially flush with an end surface of the small-diameter portion 27, so that the end surface of the outer tube 19 of the meter cable 12 which is to be fitted into the opening 15a of the gear case 15 comes into abutment thereto.<br>
[0027]<br>
A fitting hole 31 of square shape in cross section corresponding to the square shape in cross section of the shaft portion 20 of the inner cable 18 is formed from a border with respect to the teeth 13a on the large-diameter portion 25 over<br><br>
the medium-diameter portion 26 and the small-diameter portion 27 in the pinion 13. The fitting hole 31 opens toward the small-diameter portion 27, and a tapered inner wall portion 32 which is reduced in diameter gradually toward the open end is formed on a periphery of the open end, as shown in Fig. 4 to Fig. 6. Reference numeral 33 in Fig. 2 to Fig. 4 and Fig. 6 designates a molding hole for forming the teeth 13a on the outer peripheral surface of the end portion of the large-diameter portion 25.<br>
[0028]<br>
In this embodiment, as shown in Fig. 4 to Fig. 6, guide projections 34 for guiding the shaft portion 20 of the inner cable 18 to the fitting hole 31 of the pinion 13 are provided on the tapered inner wall portion 32 of the pinion 13, and the guide projections 34 are provided on the fitting hole 31 on the four sides portions of the square shape in cross section from substantially center positions between adjacent corners 35 toward the tapered inner wall portion 32.<br>
[0029]<br>
In order to mount the meter cable 12 to the gear case 15, an operator inserts the shaft portion 20 of the inner cable 18 of the meter cable 12 into the opening 15a of the gear case 15 together with the outer tube 19. Then, the shaft portion 20 of the inner cable 18 is guided along the guide projections 34 provided on the tapered inner wall portion 32 of the pinion<br><br>
13 into the fitting hole 31. When the shaft portion 20 of the inner cable 18 is further advanced toward the fitting hole 31, a distal end of the shaft portion 20 of square shape in cross section is corrected in phase by the guide projections 34 at the open end of the fitting hole 31 of square shape in cross section, and aligned with the phase of the fitting hole 31 automatically. Then, the shaft portion 20 of the inner cable 18 is pushed in this state, whereby the shaft portion 20 is fitted to the fitting hole 31, and hence the end of the meter cable 12 is mounted to the pinion 13.<br>
[0030]<br>
When the shaft portion 20 of the inner cable 18 is inserted into the opening 15a of the gear case 15 together with the outer tube 19, the engaging projection 22 is pressed by an inner peripheral wall of the gear case 15 and slides on an inner peripheral wall in a state of being resiliently deformed radially inwardly. Then, at a timing when the shaft portion 20 of the inner cable 18 is fitted to the fitting hole 31 of the pinion 13, the engaging projection 22 is resiliently restored at the position of the engaging hole 21 and engaged with the engaging hole 21, whereby the meter cable 12 is prevented from coming off and rotating, so that the meter cable 12 is fixed to the gear case 15.<br>
[0031]<br>
The engaging projection 22 can be released from the state<br><br>
of being engaged with the engaging hole 21 of the gear case 15 easily by being pushed from the outside radially inwardly of the outer tube 19, and hence the meter cable 12 can be pulled out and disconnected easily from the gear case 15 by pushing the engaging projection 22 from the outside.<br>
[0032]<br>
In the meter cable mounting structure according to the first embodiment described above, the tapered inner wall portion 32 of the pinion 13 is formed with the guide projections 34 for guiding the shaft portion 20 of the inner cable 18 into the fitting hole 31 of the pinion 13, and the guide projections 34 are provided on the fitting hole 31 of the pinion 13 on the four sides of the square shape in cross section at substantially center positions between the adjacent corners 35 toward the tapered inner wall portion 32. Therefore, the shaft portion 20 of the inner cable 18 is guided to the open end of the fitting hole 31 of the pinion 13 along the guide projections 34, and the distal end of the shaft portion 20 of the inner cable 18 and the fitting hole 31 can be aligned easily in phase at the open end. Accordingly, the mounting operation of the meter cable 12 can be facilitated.<br>
[0033] (Second Embodiment)<br>
Referring now to Fig. 7 and Fig. 8, a meter cable mounting structure according to a second embodiment of the present<br><br>
invention will be described. In this embodiment, a different point is only in that a guide wall portion 40 is provided on the tapered inner wall portion 32 in contrast to the structure in the first embodiment in which the guide projections 34 are provided on the tapered inner wall portion 32 of the pinion 13. Therefore, parts which overlap with the first embodiment will be represented by the same reference numerals and description thereof will be omitted or simplified.<br>
[0034]<br>
As shown in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8, the meter cable mounting structure according to this embodiment is such that the guide wall portion 40 for guiding the shaft portion 20 of the inner cable 18 into the fitting hole 31 of the pinion 13 is provided on the tapered inner wall portion 32 of the pinion 13, and the guide wall portion 40 is provided so as to extend along an inner wall surface of the fitting hole 31 on one side of the square shape in cross section toward the tapered inner wall portion 32 and continue to the tapered inner wall portion 32.<br>
[0035]<br>
In order to mount the meter cable 12 to the gear case 15, when inserting the shaft portion 20 of the inner cable 18 of the meter cable 12 into the opening 15a of the gear case 15 together with the outer tube 19, the operator inserts the shaft portion 20 toward the fitting hole 31 side so that the side surface of the shaft portion 20 of the inner cable 18 on<br><br>
one side of the square shape in cross section moves along a wall surface of the guide wall portion 40 provided on the tapered inner wall portion 32 of the pinion 13, whereby the shaft portion 20 is guided into the fitting hole 31 in a state of being substantially aligned with the fitting hole 31 in phase, and the distal end of the shaft portion 20 of square shape in cross section is automatically aligned with the fitting hole 31 in phase at the open end of the fitting hole 31 of square shape in cross section. Then, the operator pushes the shaft portion 20 of the inner cable 18 inward in this state, the shaft portion 20 is fitted into the fitting hole 31 whereby the meter cable 12 is mounted to the pinion 13.<br>
[0036]<br>
In the meter cable mounting structure according to the second embodiment described above, the guide wall portion 40 for guiding the shaft portion 20 of the inner cable 18 to the fitting hole 31 of the pinion 13 is provided on the tapered inner wall portion 32 of the pinion 13, and the guide wall portion 40 is provided so as to extend along the inner wall surface of the fitting hole 31 on one side of the square shape in cross section toward the tapered inner wall portion 32 and continue to the tapered inner wall portion. Therefore, the shaft portion 20 of the inner cable 18 is guided to the open end of the fitting hole 31 of the pinion 13 along the guide wall portion 40, so that the distal end of the shaft portion<br><br>
20 of the inner cable 18 can easily be aligned with the fitting hole 31 in phase at the open end. Accordingly, the mounting operation of the meter cable 12 can be facilitated.<br>
Since other structures and effects and advantages are the same as the first embodiment, description will be omitted.<br>
[0037]<br>
The present invention is not limited to the above-described embodiments, and may be modified in various manners as needed without departing the scope of the present invention.<br>
For example, the case in which the present invention is applied to a structure in which one end of the meter cable 12 is mounted to the pinion 13 by fitting the shaft portion 20 at one end of the inner cable 18 to the fitting hole 31 of the pinion 13 which is interlocked with the camshaft as a rotation detecting part on the side of the engine 4 has been shown as an example. However, alternatively, or in addition, the present invention may be applied to a structure in which the shaft portion 20 at the other end of the inner cable 18 if fitted into the fitting hole provided on the revolving shaft of the tachometer in the meter box 10, and the other end of the meter cable 12 is mounted to the revolving shaft of the tachometer.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, the present invention may also be applied to a structure in which the shaft portion 20 at one end of the inner cable 18 of the meter cable 12 is fitted to<br><br>
the fitting hole of the pinion which is interlocked with a speed detecting part 41 on the front wheel side, whereby the one end of the meter cable 12 is mounted to the pinion.
