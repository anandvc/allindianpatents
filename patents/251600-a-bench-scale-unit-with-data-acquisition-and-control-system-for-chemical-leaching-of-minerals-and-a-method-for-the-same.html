Field of Invention:-<br>
This invention relates to the field of chemical leaching in general and to a<br>
bench scale unit with data acquisition and control system for chemical<br>
leaching of minerals and a process for the same in particular.<br>
Background and prior art:-<br>
The process of liquid/solid extraction, also known as leaching, involves the<br>
transfer of a solute from a solid, generally employed in particulate form, to a<br>
liquid solvent which is termed the "extract". In this process, the solid imbibes<br>
the solvent which dissolves the solute and thereby extract it from the solid.<br>
Leaching is a very old process and a great diversity of apparatus has been<br>
developed over the years to meet the varying requirements of the process in<br>
respect to its widely diverse applications. Leaching processes have been<br>
proposed which operate in a batch, semi-batch or continuous mode, and both<br>
single-stage and multi-stage contacting techniques are used.<br>
Leaching equipment is commercially available for a wide variety of processes,<br>
including fixed-bed processes in which solvent is percolated through a<br>
stationery bed of solids, moving-bed processes in which the solids are<br>
conveyed through the solvent with little or no agitation, and dispersed -solid<br>
processes in which the solids are dispersed in the solvent by mechanical<br>
agitation. Among the many critical problems involved in the successful<br>
operation of a leaching process are those associated with the fact that the<br><br>
solid material to be leached is often quite heterogeneous in character, and<br>
therefore exceedingly difficult to treat in an optimum manner.<br>
This invention discloses a bench scale unit with data acquisition and control<br>
system where various minerals and metals can be extracted at elevated<br>
temperature and atmospheric pressure using the process of leaching. This<br>
invention also provides apparatus for dewatering and leach reactors which<br>
may be suitable for carrying out the leaching process. An effort has been<br>
made to design and develop a bench scale unit where up to 2Kg of ore can<br>
be treated. This will help in optimization as well as scaling up the chemical<br>
leaching process to commercial scale. In the present case, an example has<br>
been given for brief methodology to be followed for carrying out chemical<br>
leaching of coal using alkali and acid leaching method. However, this set up<br>
can be used for chemical leaching study of various other minerals using any<br>
other inorganic chemical including acid and alkalis. This set up can be used<br>
for detail kinetics, thermodynamics and energy requirement studies for<br>
extraction of minerals using existing chemical leaching process and also for<br>
development of new processes for extraction of other minerals using this<br>
leaching technique. Methodology, scientific background and few important<br>
test results using this set up have been discussed in the subsequent sections.<br>
Beneficiation is a variety of processes whereby extracted ore from mining is<br>
reduced to particles that can be separated into mineral and waste, the former<br>
suitable for further processing or direct use. It may be conducted via a range<br>
of techniques including crushing, grinding, magnetic separation, flotation,<br>
gravity etc. Beneficiation enables operators to improve the quality of their<br>
end product and to enhance the overall processing performance of an ore.<br>
Accordingly, physical as well as chemical cleaning (beneficiation) processes<br><br>
have been explored. In physical cleaning, the mineral is crushed into suitable<br>
particle size, and the waste is removed in processes based on the differences<br>
in their physical properties. Based on the physical properties that effect the<br>
separation of the coal from the impurities, physical cleaning methods are<br>
generally divided into the following categories: gravity, flotation magnetic and<br>
electrical. In contrast to physical cleaning, chemical processes involve<br>
addition of chemical which reacts with the mineral matter or waste and allow<br>
it to be easily removed. This includes mainly the process of liquid/solid<br>
extraction, also known as leaching, involves the transfer of a solute from a<br>
solid, generally employed in particulate form, to a liquid solvent which is<br>
termed the "extract" . In this process, the solid imbibes the solvent which<br>
dissolves the solute and thereby extracts it from the solid.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6613271 discloses about an apparatus and methods for<br>
recovering valuable metals particularly gold using an in line leach reactor.<br>
This invention states about the apparatus and method for continuously<br>
separating a dense valuable material such as gold from a feed including a<br>
grinding mill which directs a crushed feed through hydrocyclones for<br>
separation into a light and dense fraction. The dense fraction is concentrated<br>
further by in line pressure jigs in line and the concentrate is leached in a<br>
rotating leaching reactor. The resulting pregnant liquor is subjected to<br>
eletrowinning to recover gold and the spent liquor is recycled.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4824939 discloses about a novel leaching process which is<br>
useful for leaching a particulate solid material that comprises extractable and<br>
nonextractable portions. The process includes the steps of introducing the<br>
particulate solid material and a liquid solvent to an extraction zone; agitating<br>
the liquid solvent to a degree sufficient to suspend the particulate solid<br>
material and effect segregation of particles thereof in relation to their<br><br>
propensity to settle; maintaining contact between the liquid solvent and the<br>
particulate solid material for a time sufficient to leach extractable material<br>
therefrom: and selectively withdrawing particles from the extraction zone. In<br>
a preferred embodiment, the leaching process is a multi-stage process<br>
employing a series of stages in which the selectively withdrawn particles from<br>
each stage are introduced to the next successive stage of the series.<br>
U.S. Patent No.5993635 relates to a method of enabling a sulphide mineral<br>
composition to be leached at atmospheric pressure instead of above<br>
atmospheric pressure which has been hitherto required in order to achieve<br>
acceptable rates of leaching.<br>
In the case of the chemical leaching processes for removing ash from coal,<br>
the inorganic substances constituting the ash content of coal are treated with<br>
chemical agents and separated from the coal for removal. Various chemicals<br>
are used for the chemical beneficiation process. Some of these chemicals will<br>
have a tendency to dissolve certain inorganic constituents preferentially to<br>
others and the actual chemical to be used may depend upon the inorganic<br>
content of the carbonaceous material which is fed to the process.<br>
Chemical leaching of coal is a technology to produce ultra clean coal where<br>
the ash content of clean coal is as low as ~ 1.0% basing on mineralogical<br>
composition of the feed coal. There are potential use of this ultra clean coal<br>
both as a fuel and nonfuel.<br>
Such processes are known as processes for removing ash from coal or coke<br>
(Japanese Patent Publication No.466/1942), a process for removing sulfur<br>
and ash from coals (Japanese Patent Publication No. 23711/1971) and a coal<br><br>
deashing process (Japanese Patent Disclosure No. 133487/1980). The patent<br>
literature is replete with chemical coal beneficiation processes. For example,<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,424,062, 4,071,328, 4,083,940, 4,134,737 and U.S.<br>
Patent No. 4,408,999 etc. discloses about processes for chemically removing<br>
ash from coal by treating ash containing coal in various chemical reagents at<br>
different operating conditions. Most of these studies have been carried out in<br>
laboratory scale using flask, rotamantle and beakers etc. where small quantity<br>
of coal can be treated.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,936,045 discloses about a set up where alkali and acid<br>
leaching of coal can be carried out in a 500 ml stainless pressure vessel under<br>
pressure at high temperatures. In this process the alkali and coal slurry<br>
passes through an electric emersion heater and finally passes through the<br>
leaching reactor where the removal of mineral matter takes place.<br>
However the prior art does not disclose any bench scale unit for conducting<br>
trial runs and experimentation of chemical leaching of minerals.<br>
A need is therefore felt that chemical leaching of minerals should be studied<br>
in small scale to optimize chemical leaching, where various data should be<br>
recorded for analysis and optimization of the process.<br>
The present invention seeks to overcome these drawbacks of the prior art.<br>
Objects of the invention:-<br>
1.	An object of the invention is to provide a bench scale unit to study<br>
chemical leaching of minerals.<br>
2.	Another object of the invention is to optimize a chemical leaching process.<br>
3.	A further object of the invention is to provide a facility for acquiring ,<br>
storing and displaying various data related to a chemical leaching process for<br>
minerals.<br><br>
4.	Yet another object of the invention is to make a chemical leaching process<br>
most energy efficient.<br>
5.	A still further object is to project the actual energy needs of a full scale<br>
chemical leaching process for extraction of minerals, including coal.<br>

The invention will now be described in detail with the help of the<br>
accompanying which depict an exemplary embodiment of the invention.<br>
However, there can be several other embodiments of the invention, all of<br>
which are deemed covered by this description.<br>
Set up description:<br>
The bench scale unit (1.0) best shown in Fig.l consists of a batch reactor<br>
(11) of nearly 23 litres capacity with heating arrangements, condenser (12)<br>
with provision for reflux, data acquisition and control system (13) and<br>
sparkler horizontal filter(16). The batch reactor is of diameter 25cm and<br>
height 45cm. The reactor is made up of SS-316 material with Teflon coating.<br>
The reactor is heated with four heating coils (26-29) of 1-kilowatt capacity<br>
each which are fitted outside the circumference of the reactor. A stirrer (17)<br><br>
which extends up to nearly 5cm from the bottom of the reactor is fixed at the<br>
middle. A D.C. motor (14) runs the stirrer and its speed can be measured<br>
using a sensor which is mounted in front of the stirrer. It gives the stirrer<br>
speed by magnetic induction principle. The maximum rpm can go up to<br>
~1500 and it can be controlled using a variac. However, the stirrer is usually<br>
operated at around 600-900rpm. Prepared reagents are kept inside bottles at<br>
a height from the reactor from where those are fed to the reactor using a<br>
manifold, pipes and connectors. There is facility for filling the reactor with<br>
coal slurry using pipes.<br>
As shown in Fig-2 three Resistance Temperature Detectors (RTD 1-3) are<br>
mounted at bottom and, 10cm and 20cm from the bottom of the reactor. The<br>
RTD 1 at the bottom is connected to the PID controller(21) through which the<br>
temperature inside the reactor can be controlled through relay switches (22-<br>
25) connected to the heaters. The four relay switches can also be controlled<br>
manually by switching the relay on or off. Remaining two RTDs (RTD2&amp;3) are<br>
connected to the data acquisition module (31) through a signal conditioning<br>
element(33).<br>
There is an energy meter (32) to sense the amount of current passing<br>
through the "Live wire" which provides electricity supply to the four heating<br>
coils(26-29). The output from this device (current data) is sent to host<br>
computer (15) for the following calculation.<br>
Power(kwhr)=Power(kwhr)+Voltage (volt)*Current (ampere)<br>
Energy=Power x time<br><br>
The temperature data from data acquisition module as well as controller,<br>
energy data etc can be seen on the host computer through a graphical user<br>
interface developed particularly for this set up. The details of the<br>
microprocessor based interfacing for data acquisition is described later. The<br>
data acquisition modules, PID controller, signal conditioning elements, 24 V<br>
battery, variac and display unit of stirrer etc are placed inside a panel. The<br>
schematic diagrams of the data acquisition and control modules is shown in<br>
Figures2 and 3.<br>
The bench scale unit also consists of a sparkler horizontal filter (16) having<br>
polypropylene filter cloths. The final coal/mineral slurry after treatment inside<br>
the reactor is filtered using a series of polypropylene filter cloth of 5-micron<br>
size. The filter cake is deposited on the top of the filter cloth. The filter cake<br>
is dried inside a drying oven having humidity control facility. The filter<br>
operates on a one HP pump. The intermediate samples are however filtered<br>
using normal filter papers using a conical flask and a funnel.<br>
Microprocessor Based interfacing of the sensors with Computer:<br>
It is achieved by using common hardware, well known in the prior art.<br>
Interfacing of the sensors with computers has wide applicability in industry. It<br>
can be used to get on-line from the process or to operate an instrument<br>
(relay or SSR etc.). 1-7000 modules (31) are compact, intelligent sensor-to-<br>
computer interface unit designed specifically for reliable operation in harsh<br>
environments. Encased in rugged industrial grade plastic packages, their<br>
built-in microprocessors let them independently provide intelligent signal<br>
conditioning, analog I/O, digital I/O, data display and RS-485<br>
communication. These modules can be controlled remotely by a set of<br>
commands. They provide an extremely simple and cost effective way to allow<br><br>
any PC equipped with a serial port to carry out monitoring and control<br>
applications.<br>
Each Module has on board microprocessors for control, and communication is<br>
carried out over a 2 wire RS 485 communication link (35) at data rates up to<br>
115 bps, and distances up to 1200m. A serial command and response<br>
protocol makes control of modules extremely easy from any high level<br>
language (Turbo C or Visual Basic), under any operating system. Analog<br>
Input Modules are available to monitor Thermocouples, RTD's, voltages and<br>
current signals. Readings are automatically converted to engineering format,<br>
and transmitted to host computer (15) on request. Output Modules either<br>
give current or voltage outputs with microprocessor controlled slew rate. In<br>
addition to the analog modules, a selection of digital I/O modules provide<br>
high voltage input, open collector and relay outputs.<br>
The 7000 series RS 485 network is among the most powerful and flexible 2<br>
wire RS 485 network in the world. It is a multiple baud rate, and multiple<br>
data format network system. That is to say, all remote modules mentioned<br>
above share the same RS 485 network. The 7520, the RS 232 to RS 485<br>
converter equips a "self tuner" inside. Therefore, it can detect the baud rate,<br>
and data format automatically and control direction of the RS 485 network<br>
precisely. Therefore the user can connect all this equipment to the same RS<br>
485 network. This method greatly reduces system cost and increase<br>
reliability.<br>
The Host PC(15) will send out a command string from its RS 232 port. The<br>
7520 will convert these RS 232 signals to RS 485 signals, and isolate the host<br>
from the RS network. The 7000 series modules will be directly connected to<br>
the RS485 network.<br><br>
The 2 wire RS 485 network is a pair of differential network. So, logically, the<br>
2 lines equal to 1 data line. The data line can be used both to transfer<br>
command and receive results. This needs a direction controller to handle the<br>
2 wire RS 485 network. The 7520, the RS 485 to RS 232 converter is an<br>
intelligent controller. It will automatically detect and control he direction of<br>
data flow. When the host compute sends a RS 232 command string, the 7520<br>
sets the direction of RS 485 network in the received mode, and the 7000<br>
series can receive the host command string. After the command string is<br>
finished, the 7520 will set the RS 485 network in send mode to allow the<br>
7000 modules to send the result to the host computer.<br>
Sensors<br>
The RTD temperature Sensor (RTD1-3):<br>
The RTD is a sensor that operates on the principle that the resistance of a<br>
metal like platinum increases with an increase in temperature at a specific<br>
rate. The Resistance Temperature Detector is often selected when accurate<br>
temperature measurements are required. RTD's could be made of Copper,<br>
Nickel or Platinum. Currently, Platinum is the industry standard for the<br>
material use in making RTD's. As long as the temperature relationship with<br>
resistance is predictable, smooth, and stable, the phenomenon can be used<br>
for accurate temperature measurement. To ensure high accuracy, the<br>
resistance effects due to impurities must be small and the resistance versus<br>
temperature curve must be known and repeatable. Platinum RTD's are<br>
suitable for use from -50C to 550C, when long-term temperature stability and<br>
repeatability is required. They offer virtually a linear response over this range.<br>
The details of the two data acquisition module used in the present case has<br>
been described below.<br><br>
Modules<br>
1.7520 Module<br>
This module provides the necessary serial bus protocol conversion from PC<br>
standard RS 232 to a 2 wire RS 485 interface. This module connects to all<br>
other modules on the RS 485 network. Its specification are:<br>

Output: RS 485 protocol (2 wire, D+, D-)<br>
Baud Rate: "Self Tuner" auto switching baud rate, 300 to 115200bps.<br>
Modules: 256 modules maximum without repeater<br>
2.7017 Module<br>
The 7017 is a 8-Channel Voltage and 4-20mA Input Module. It takes in an<br>
analog input Eight different inputs can be given to this module at a time at<br>
Channel 0 to Channel 7. Its specifications are<br>
Input type:mV,V,mA<br>
Input Range:+/- 150mV, +/-1 V, +/- 200mA<br>
Sample Rate: 10 samples per second<br>
Bandwidth: 13.1 Hz<br>
Accuracy: 0.01% or better<br>
Method for chemical leaching of minerals in the bench scale unit:<br>
In the present case a brief method is described for carrying out chemical<br>
leaching of coal using alkali and acid leaching method with the bench scale<br>
unit in accordance with the invention. This set up can be used for chemical<br>
leaching study of various other minerals using any other inorganic chemical<br>
including acid and alkalis under atmospheric condition.<br><br>
Here, West Bokaro fine clean coal was taken as a feed sample to this process.<br>
This fine clean coal is generated in West Bokaro coal washery through froth<br>
flotation process. The feed sample can be taken directly as obtained after<br>
froth flotation treatment or can be crushed to -72 BS mesh size (-0.025mm)<br>
for improving the kinetics of the process. Ash content of this coal sample was<br>
13.1%. This West Bokaro fine clean coal is referred as feed coal in the<br>
subsequent section of this write up and the clean coal produced from this<br>
process is referred as Product.<br>
Sample Preparation:<br>
1-2 kg of coal was taken through coning quartering method from the received<br>
West Bokaro fine clean coal. This coal sample was dried in an oven at 105°C.<br>
Chemicals:<br>
The experiments were carried out with various chemicals initially. However,<br>
since the presence of acidic compounds like silica and alumina in Indian coals<br>
are significantly higher, some chemicals tend to behave better than other<br>
chemicals. Treating such coals using dilute aqueous NaOH solution under mild<br>
conditions at atmospheric pressure followed by acid leaching/washing results<br>
in substantial demineralization of the coal. The alkali and acid used can be<br>
recovered for re-use. This affords a convenient method for coal<br>
demineralization. Commercially available sodium hydroxide (NaOH) in<br>
combination with sulphuric acid (H2S04) and HCI were used in the present<br>
method.<br>
The treatment process<br>
The experiments for chemical leaching were carried out in the reactor<br>
assembly using two steps. In the first step, feed coals(l-2 kg) were treated<br><br>
with varying concentration (10-50%) of alkali (NaOH) (10 lit) at varying<br>
temperatures under reflux with stirring for particular length of time (1.5-7.0<br>
hr) in the bench scale reactor described above. The treated coal is then<br>
washed repeatedly with water and/or HCI and then dried. The washed alkali<br>
treated coal (10-50gm) is then reacted with 10-20% H2S04/ HCL for 1.0-5.0<br>
hr keeping the same condition as described above. Then , the treated coal is<br>
filtered, washed with water and dried before sending for their chemical,<br>
rheological and petrographical properties.<br>
The coal to slurry ratio is maintained at 1:10 or 1:5 keeping the total volume<br>
10 litres. The moment the feed is fed to the reactor, the stirrer and the data<br>
acquisition system are switched on. The readings are checked in the host<br>
computer using the GUI to ensure the proper working of the sensors. Once<br>
checked, the data are captured using the save command which saves the<br>
data to a text file.<br>
At the start of the experiment all the four heaters (26-29) are switched on.<br>
Any of the four heaters can be switched on or off based on requirement. For<br>
example, once the set point is reached, the set temperature can be controlled<br>
using only one heater. During the test, intermediate samples can be collected<br>
any time from the sampling pipe present at the bottom of the reactor.<br>
Different amount of sample can be collected at various length of time during<br>
the test basing on subsequent analysis to be one with the samples. The<br>
samples collected can be washed with water and/or 10-20% HCI/H2SO4<br>
solution. These samples are dried and analyzed for various properties.<br>
After the completion of the experiment, the remaining sample present inside<br>
the reactor is taken out from the bottom and filtered using the sparkler<br><br>
horizontal filter. The filter cake is dried inside a drying oven and analyzed for<br>
various properties. Multi-stage experiments as well as intermediate dosing<br>
experiments were also carried out using the experimental set up.<br>
The experiments for chemical leaching of coal to remove mineral matter were<br>
conducted at various levels of reagent concentration, coal weight, coal to<br>
solution ratio and type of washing (only water or water and 10-20%<br>
H2SO4/HCI combined together). The samples were analyzed for ash, volatile<br>
matter alkali content (Na20 &amp; K20), ash constituents (Fe, CaO, Si02/ AI203,<br>
MgO, MnO, Ti02, Phosphorous, and Sulphur etc.), calorific value (kcal/kg) and<br>
Crucible Swelling Number (CSN) etc. Using this set up when chemical<br>
treatment of West Bokaro fine clean coal were carried out, the ash content<br>
reduced from 13.1% to nearly 5.0%. With this set up the temperature profile<br>
during the experimentation as well as the energy requirement during the<br>
experimentation can be evaluated as can be seen from Figures 4 and 5.<br>
With the development of the present bench scale set up, the chemical<br>
cleaning process can be carried out in bench scale using a bigger size reactor<br>
with jacketed steam heating or electric heating arrangement as described<br>
above. Detail thermodynamic and kinetic study as well as energy requirement<br>
for this process can be evaluated using the bench scale unit. This will help in<br>
optimization as well scaling up the chemical leaching process to commercial<br>
scale and low ash coal can be produced economically for coke making.<br>
However, this set up can also be used for detail kinetics, thermodynamics and<br>
energy requirement studies for extraction of minerals using existing chemical<br>
leaching processes and also for development of new processes for extraction<br>
of other minerals using this leaching technique.<br><br>
Any chemical leaching process for extraction of minerals can therefore be<br>
studied with the help of the bench scale unit to determine the most efficient<br>
operating parameters to optimize the process, before a full-scale chemical<br>
leaching process is taken up.<br><br>
