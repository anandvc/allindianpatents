				<td>NOVEL    QUINUCLIDINE    DERIVATIVES    AND    MEDICINAL    COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING THE SAME<br>
This invention relates to new therapeutically useful quinuclidine derivatives, to some processes for their preparation and to pharmaceutical compositions containing them.<br>
The novel structures according to the invention are antimuscarinic agents with a potent and long lasting effect. In particular, these compounds show high affinity for muscarinic M3 receptors. This subtype of muscarinic receptor is present in glands and smooth muscle and mediates the excitatory effects of the parasympathetic system on glandular secretion and on the contraction of visceral smooth muscle (Chapter 6, Cholinergic Transmission, in HP. Rang et al., Pharmacology, Churchill Livingstone, New York, 1995).<br>
M3 antagonists are therefore known to be useful for treating diseases characterised by an increased parasympathetic tone, by excessive glandular secretion or by smooth muscle contraction (R.M. Eglen and S.S. Hegde, (1997), Drug News Perspect., 10(8):462-469).<br>
Examples of this kind of diseases are respiratory disorders such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, bronchial hyperreactivity, asthma, cough and rhinitis; urological disorders such as urinary incontinence, pollakiuria, neurogenic or unstable bladder, cystospasm and chronic cystitis; gastrointestinal disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome, spastic colitis, diverticulitis and peptic ulceration; and cardiovascular disorders such as vagally induced sinus bradycardia (Chapter 7, Muscarinic Receptor Agonists and Antagonists, in Goodman and Oilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 10the edition, McGraw Hill, Ney York, 2001).<br>
The compounds of the invention can be used alone or in association with other drugs commonly regarded as effective in the treatment of these diseases. For example, they can be administered in combination with β2-agonists, steroids, antiallergic drugs, phosphodiesterase IV inhibitors an/or leukotriene D4 (LTD4) antagonists for simultaneous, separate or sequential use in the treatment of a respiratory disease. The claimed compounds are useful for the treatment of the respiratory diseases detailed above in association with β2-agonists, steroids, antiallergic drugs or phosphodiesterase IV inhibitors.<br><br>
Compounds with related   structures have been described as anti-cholinergic and/or anti-spasmodics agents in several patents.<br>

The spatial configurations of the compounds of general formula (III) have been deduced from the configurations of their corresponding acids. These were determined either comparing the values of [a] obtained with the values described in the literature or applying the Circular Dichroism (CD) technique.<br>
Since the CD curve of (2S)-2-Cyclohexyl-2-hydroxy-2-phenylacetic acid is known (A. Tambute and A. Collet, Bulletin de la Societe Chimique de France, 1984, N° 1-2, pages 1177 to "1182) and all the acids evaluated are structurally very similar to (2S)-<br>
2-Cyclohexyl-2-hydroxy-2-phenylacetic acid, it can be assumed that the relative positions of the aryl, cycloalkyl, carboxyl and hydroxyl substituents may be identified by comparison of their respective Ae values. The resulting configurations have been expressed as R or S according to Cahn-lngol-Prelog system, (see TABLE 1)<br>
The curves of CD spectra were recorded with a Jasco-720 spectrophotometer (Software J-700) from 0.43 mM MeOH solutions of the samples in 1 mm cells at 25°C.<br>

Also included within the scope of the present invention are pharmaceutical compositions which comprise, as the active ingredient, at least one quinuclidine derivative of general formula (I) in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. Preferably the composition is made up in a form suitable for oral administration.<br>
The pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluents which are mixed with the active compound or compounds, to form the composition of this invention are well-known per se and the actual excipients used depend inter alia on the intended method of administration of the composition.<br>
Compositions of this invention are preferably adapted for oral administration. In this case, the composition for oral administration may take the form of tablets, film-coated tablets, liquid inhalant, powder inhalant and inhalation aerosol; all containing one or more compounds of the invention; such preparations may be made by methods well-known in the art.<br>
The diluents which may be used in the preparations of the compositions include those liquid and solid diluents which are compatible with the active ingredient, together with colouring or flavouring agents, if desired. Tablets or film-coated tablets may conveniently contain between 1 and 500 mg, preferably from 5 to 300 mg of active ingredient. The inhalant compositions may contain between 1 ng and 1,000 |o.g, preferably from 10 ^g to 800 ^ig of active ingredient. In human therapy, the dose of the compound of general formula (I) depend on the desired effect and duration of treatment; adult doses are generally between 3 mg and 300 mg per day as tablets and 10 jig and 800 j^g per day as inhalant composition.<br>
Pharmacological Action<br>
The results on human muscarinic receptors binding and in the test on bronchospasm in guinea pig, were obtained as described below.<br>
Human muscarinic receptor studies.<br>
The binding of [3H]-NMS to human muscarinic receptors was performed according to Waelbroek et al (1990), Mol. Pharmacol., 38: 267-273.Assays were carried out at 25°C. Membrane preparations from stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary-K1 cells (CHO) expressing the genes for the human muscarinic receptors M3 were used.<br>
For determination of ICso, membrane preparations were suspended in DPBS to a final concentration of 89 M9/ml for the M3 subtype. The membrane suspension was incubated with the tritiated compound for 60 min. After incubation the membrane fraction was separated by filtration and the bound radioactivity determined. Non specific binding was determined by addition of 10"4 M atropine. At least six concentrations were assayed in duplicate to generate individual displacement curves.<br>
Our results show that the compounds of the present invention have high affinities for muscarinic M3 receptors, preferably human muscarinic receptors. Affinity levels have been measured by in vitro assays as described above at 100 nM and 10 nM. Preferred compounds of the invention produce an inhibition of [3H]-NMS binding of at least 35 % at 10 nM and of at least 65 % at 100 nM (Table 2).<br>
(Figure Removed)Test on bronchospasm in guinea pig<br>
The studies were performed according to H. Konzett and F. Rossler (1940), Arch. Exp. Path. Pharmacol. 195: 71-74. Aqueous solutions of the agents to be tested were nebulized and inhaled by anaesthetized ventilated male guinea pigs (Dunkin-Hartley). Bronchial response to intravenous acetylcholine challenge was determined before and after drug administration and the changes in pulmonary resistance at several time-points were expressed as percent of inhibition of bronchoespasm.<br>
The compounds of the present invention inhibited the bronchospasm response to acetylcholine with high potency and a long duration of action.<br>
From the above described results one of ordinary skill in the art can readily understand that the compounds of the present invention have excellent antimuscarinic activity (M3) and thus are useful for the treatment of diseases in which the muscarinic M3 receptor is implicated, including respiratory disorders such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, bronchial hyperreactivity, asthma, cough and rhinitis; urological disorders such as urinary incontinence, pollakiuria, neurogenic or unstable bladder, cystospasm and chronic cystitis; gastrointestinal disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome, spastic colitis, diverticulitis and peptic ulceration; and cardiovascular disorders such as vagally induced sinus bradycardia. For example, the compounds of the present invention are useful for the treatment of respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic bronchitis, asthma, and rhinitis; urinary diseases such as urinary incontinence and pollakinuria in neuripenia pollakinuria, neurogenic bladder, nocturnal enuresis, unstable bladder, cytospasm and chronic cystitis; and gastrointestinal diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome, spastic colitis and diverticulitis.<br>
The present invention further provides a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable composition comprising a compound of formula (I) for use in a method of treatment of the human or animal body by therapy, in particular for the treatment of respiratory, urological or gastrointestinal disease or disorder.<br>
The present invention further provides the use of a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable composition comprising a compound of formula (I) for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of a respiratory, urological or gastrointestinal disease or disorder.<br>
Further, the compounds of formula (I) and pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound of formula (I) can be used in a method of treating a respiratory, urological or gastrointestinal disease or disorder, which method comprises<br>
administering to a human or animal patient in need of such treatment an effective, non-toxic, amount of a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of formula (I).<br>
Further, the compounds of formula (I) and pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound of formula (I) can be used in combination with other drugs effective in the treatment of these diseases. For example with (32 agonists, steroids, antiallergic drugs, phosphodiesterase IV inhibitors and/or leukotriene D4 (LTD4) inhibitors, for simultaneous, separate or sequential use in the treatment of a respiratory disease.<br>
The present invention therefore further provides a combination product comprising<br>
(i)        a compound according to the invention; and<br>
(ii)       another compound effective in the treament of a respiratory, urological or gastrointestinal disease or disorder<br>
for simultaneous, separate or sequential use.<br>
The compound (ii) which is effective in the treament of a respiratory, urological or gastrointestinal disease or disorder may be a 32 agonist, steroid, antiallergic drug, phosphodiesterase IV inhibitor and/or leukotriene D4 (LTD4) antagonist when the product is for simultaneous, separate or sequential use in the treatment of a respiratory disease. Alternatively, the compound (ii) may be ap2 agonist, steroid, antiallergic drug and/or phosphodiesterase IV inhibitor when the product is for simultaneous, separate or sequential use in the treatment of a respiratory disease.<br>
