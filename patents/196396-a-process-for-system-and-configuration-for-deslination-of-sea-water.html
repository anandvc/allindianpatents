FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a Process, System and Configuration Concept for Desalination of Sea Water. Further, this invention is concerned with the generation of fresh potable water using a novel concept. More particularly, the instant invention relates to a process, system and configuration for desalination of sea water to produce fresh water from sea water utilizing effectively the solar energy stored in the sea.<br>
At the outset of the description which follows, it is to be understood that ensuring description only illustrates a particular form of this invention. However, such particular form is only an exemplary embodiment, and without intending to imply any limitation on the scope of this invention. Accordingly, the description is to be understood as an exemplaiy embodiment and reading of the invention and not intended to be taken restrictively.<br>
It is to be noted that the prior art descriptions give in detail information of the technology, method, process and system known in the art. They indicate the improvements in the related art and the object of the invention being to overcome or surmount the deficiency associated with the prior art. This forms the essential feature and the object of the invention.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The salient feature of the invention is the production of fresh water economically from sea by using warm water from the upper strata of the sea which is flash evaporated at low pressure in a vaporizer and condensing the vapour in a condenser, also maintained at low pressure using the cold sea water taken from a depth below 150 metres without using any external energy for heating and cooling. External energy is supplied only for circulating the sea water through vaporizer and condenser at desired flow rates and maintaining the low pressure in the system by appropriate vacuum pumping system, which consist of ejectors, vacuum pumps and barometric seals.<br>
It is a known fact that 972% of the world's water is in the oceans and contains such high<br><br>
concentrations of sodium and magnesium as to be unfit for either human consumption or most industrial applications. An evaporation method was used by Greek sailors of the 4 century BC for desalting water.<br>
In the present scenario, distillation remains the most widely used desalination process. Either a multiple effect or a flash evaporator may be used. The first consist of a series of evaporators in which salt water is heated and vaporized. The hot vapor is used to heat salt water entering the next evaporator; in doing so, the vapor is cooled and condensed into fresh water. Since the multiple effect evaporator reuses heat, it requires less eneryg than a single evaporator.<br>
In flash evaporation, generally heated seawater is sprayed into a chamber kept under reduced pressure. At this reduced pressure, the water vaporizes at lower temperature, so that the flash evaporators require comparatively less energy.<br>
It is a known feet that water is the most precious resource needed by man and all the living organisms of the earth. This is essential for domestic, industrial and agricultural purposes. A survey of water resources reveals that there is an enormous quantity of fresh water available on earth but that is poorly distributed. The tremendous growth of population and industry, rapid demographic expansion of developing countries and improvement in standard of living in developed countries have led to taxing of available water supplies by overdraft: and pollution even in locations known to have adequate water resources. Also less than 2% of the water on earth is only fit for drinking and sustenance of life. There have been global developments and agriculture which have necessitated to seek alternate sources for fresh water. Desalination of water is identified as one such resource for obtaining potable water. Desalination may become desirable in regions poorly supplied with fresh water but contain plenty of saline waters. Development and application of reliable desalination techniques allowing to produce fresh water economically remain a major challenge for humanity.<br>
The dissolved salts have to be separated out from the saline water.   The process of<br><br>
desalination as is known widely could be achieved by several means such as ion exchange processes; membrane processes including electro dialysis, reverse osmosis; process based on change of states including freezing, distillation, vapor compression and the like. As on today, it is estimated that among the total installed capacity of fresh water production adopting all these processes, a very large percentage is through distillation process.<br>
The average salt content of seawater is about 35g/l Computations reveal that the theoretical energy necessary to desalt one cubic meter of seawater is about 0.7 KWH, though the actual energy consumption could be much higher. The entire economics of the desalination industry depends upon the question of how the energy for desalination process could be made available. The most obvious solution lies in the use of fossil fuels, if it could be available cheap, In  the case of solar energy as an alternate, the capital cost of solar energy collecting devices is extremely high though the cost of energy production is negligible. Comparison of estimates of capital costs reported in literature for a large scale desalination system using fossil energy and solar energy indicates that use of solar energy by collecting it by conventional means does not appear to be an economically viable solution for the desalination process.<br>

A search for patents in the relevant technology using various databases was conducted. From the search the following related patents are identified. A thorough examination of patent has been done. The data of related patents and result of the finding are as follows:<br>

The wet air is then indirectly cooled by cold seawater so that the desalinate condensate is collected in a container before the air leaving the flue.<br>
W, German Patent 3,132,868,3 describes a solar multistage flash evaporation desalination unit coupled to an absorption heat pump where heat is stored during the day by endothermic desorption and used at night to preheat sea water.<br>
Desalination by distillation had been widely used to obtain fresh water. Most known distillation devices suffer a common drawback of ineflficiency and have limitations for use in large-scale applications. This inefficiency results in either low outputs of pure water or in extremely high power requirements. The known devices requiring high power inputs result in unacceptable environmental impacts. In addition, the fresh water thus produced requires addition of small quantities of minerals for making them suitable for human consumption.<br><br>
The solar energy has been the most prominent of alternate source of energy for desalination. The solar energy is commonly utilized at vaporization step in the distillation process. For this the device must be quite large in size covering large areas and requiring large solar energy transfer device.<br>
Present invention obviates the disadvantage of prior art and provides a system which is compact without requiring additional sources of energy supply such as solar pond, boilers and large structures as is used in other configurations to heat the feed water. Depending upon the location of the plant, it can have on board generator or power supply through cables fix)m shore for the supply of electrical energy for circulating sea water and maintaining desired vacuum in the system according to the process requirements.<br>
Desalination through phase change — Vaporization and condensation - is a well-known and widely adopted process. As explained earlier, in this process under this invention, the warm seawater from the upper strata of the sea at temperature above 20° C is flash evaporated at low pressure in a vaporizer and this vapor is condensed in the condenser by the cold seawater below 20° C, taken from water depth of below 150 m. There is no external energy supply for heating the feed water. External energy is supplied only for circulating the seawater through vaporizer and condenser at desired flow rates and maintaining the low pressure in the system by appropriate vacuum pumping system, which consists of ejectors, vacuum pumps and barometric seals.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
The extensive study of the patent specification in the related art reveals that energy cost is the major constraint in all technology so far known in the art. Therefore the inventor has identified the need to overcome the problem inherent in the prior art technology. Having addressed to the problems associated with prior art technology the inventor proposed the novel solution in the form of a process, a system and a design for generating potable water from sea water using maximally the solar energy stored in the sea water.<br><br>
The present invention addresses itself in making use of the solar energy, stored in the sea at different depths mainly for separation of dissolved salts from seawater in an economically viable manner. The novelty of the invention is that unlike the conventional processes, the solar energy is not collected as it is radiated from the sun, but is collected from its dormant state. The transfer of this stored energy in the sea is made possible by taking advantage of the temperature driving potential existing in the varying depths of water in the sea.<br>
Another feature of the invention is to develop a process and system which is compact and to maximally use the solar energy stored in the upper strata of the sea water and depths thereby requiring no additional sources of energy supply such as solar pond, boilers, large structures to receive solar energy etc, to heat the feed water in producing fresh water.<br>
The basic scheme of separation of salt from water by a phase change process (distillation) in the conventional system is in two steps: - In the first step the water is preheated by external energy and flash evaporated and thus separated from salts and brought to a vapor state. In the second step, the vaporized water is brought back to the liquid state by condensing it using water at ambient conditions as a coolant.<br>
In the present invention, the seawater from the upper strata of the sea is flash evaporated in a vacuum vessel and no external heat is supplied for preheating the feed water. The generated water vapor is at a temperature tower than the ambient. For the second step of condensing the vapor, the cooling water has to be at a much lower temperature, and hence the cold water available from the ocean depth below 150 m from surface is used. The entire process does not make use of any external source of energy other than that needed for operating the pumps for feed water, cooling water and vacuum pumping system. The solar energy stored in the upper surface of the ocean is used to the maximum possible extent.<br>
The present system according to this invention provides for two system configurations depending upon the bathymetry and user location. In the first embodiment the system is<br><br>
bare-mounted and moored at appropriate water depths. The barge has normally a moon pool at the centre through which seawater intakes and discharges are made by suitable pipes and ducts. The entire system including the power supply is mounted on the barge. The fresh water is collected from the barge and transported to the users. This system configuration could provide fresh water to offshore activities as well.<br>
In the second embodiment, the system is shelf mounted in shallow waters or on shore with provision to receive warm seawater from the upper strata of the sea and cold sea water from depths. This could receive electrical supply from shore stations which also has facilities to receive, store and transport fresh water to different users.<br>
The foregoing description outlined rather broadly preferred and alternative feature of the present invention so that those skilled in the art may better understand the detailed description of the invention that follows. Additional features of the invention will be described hereinafter. Those skilled in the art should appreciate that they can readily use the disclosed conception and specific embodiment as a basis for designing and modifying other structures for carrying out the same purposes of the present invention. Those skilled in the art should realize such equivalent conception do not depart from the spirit and scope of the invention in its broadest form.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ONE EMBODIMENT OF INVENTION<br>
In the invented system illustrated in Fig.l, a novel concept of a desalination system and process is evolved whereby sea water from the upper strata of the sea at the ambient temperature without preheating is flash evaporated in a vertical vaporizer maintained at a low pressure. The water vapor, free from dissolved matters condenses as fresh water in a condenser also maintained at low pressure. The vaporizer and condenser are maintained at low pressure by a vacuum pumping system and barometric seals. The hydrostatic pressure discharges the un-evaporated feed water and the condensed fi-esh water without any additional pumping system. The noteworthy feature of the concept is that while the feed brine is drawn fi-om the relatively warm surface of the sea, the coolant for the condenser is drawn fi-om the relatively cold water, from the depth of the ocean. The temperature difference between the seawater at the strata of the sea and at depth provides the necessary driving potential. The vacuum pumping system consists of ejectors, primarily water jet ejectors and mechanical vacuum pumping devices. The low temperature seawater from ocean depth is pumped at high pressure as driving fluid in the water jet ejectors to produce the necessary vacuum for operation of the flash vaporizer. The absence of preheating of feed and use of low temperature sea water from depth for condensing vapour and operation of the ejector system could make the scheme energy efficient and cost effective. Systems could be developed based on this concept for different applications in agricultural, domestic, industrial and offshore programmes. The system block diagram of the concept is given in fig.1<br><br>
Figure 1 of the drawing identifies and links various parts of the system. Control system with distributed sensors and control devices are denoted by (1) and the linkages by (14) and vacuum pumping system and vacuum storage by (2). The feed water from the upper strata of sea (7) is stored in the Feed Water Storage (3) and injected through multijets into the Vapouriser system (4) to aid flash evaporation. Unevaporated feed water is returned to the sea (8) from vapouriser system (4). The water vapour coming out of the vapouriser is passed into a low pressure heat exchanger in the Condenser system (5). Cold water fix)m depth of the sea (10) is stored in a Cooling Water Storage (13) from which it is circulated to Heat Exchanger in low pressure condenser system (5) for condensing the vapour coming out from Vapouriser system (4). The cooling water outlet from Heat Exchanger in Condenser system (5) is discharged into the sea (9), The fresh water from condenser is stored in a fresh water storage (6). The cooling water from storage (13) is also supplied to the water jet ejector in the vacuum pumping system (2) which has a provision for gas discharge to the atmosphere (11) and liquid discharge to sea (12). The control system (1) with linkages (14) maintains the vacuum and liquid levels and the flow rates at the desired values according to the process requirement.<br>
The invented system can be a barge-mounted system, moored at suitable water depth or shore/shelf mounted system with necessary piping system to supply required wann seawater from upper stata of the sea and cold water from depth. This option of tiie layout depends upon the bathymetry at the site of the plant.<br>
The process of desalination of sea water comprises the following steps.<br>
a)	Storing of feed water taken from upper strata of the sea.<br>
b)	Vapourisation of feed water with injectors to aid flash evaporation using vapouriser module maintained at low pressure with the aid of vacuum pumping module and barametric seal.<br>
c)	Storing of cooling water taken from ocean depth.<br>
d)	Condensation of water vapour using low pressure condenser module and using cooling water taken from ocean depth and barametric seal for fresh water collection.<br><br>
e)  Storing of fresh water.<br>
e) Stroring of fresh water..<br>
tems;<br>
f)	Vacuum pumping for maintaining desired vacuum in vapouriser - condenser module and associated means and barametric seals.<br>
g)	Controlling the entire process by means of a control system with distributed sensors and control devices.<br>
Fig. 2 depicts the desalination system having five subsystt<br>
They are :<br>
a)	Vaporizing and condensing system consisting of vaporizer with special injection system and condenser with heat exchanger. Both vaporizer and condenser can be separate units or integrated units with barometric seals.<br>
b)	Vacuum pumping system withvacuum chamber and combination of ejectors and vacuum pumps.<br>
c)	Cooling system to condense the vapors using cold seawater, taken from depths.<br>
d)	Storage system for Warm sea water from upper strata of the sea. Cold sea water from lower strata of sea and Fresh water.<br>
e)	Instrumentation and control system including power supply.<br>
In a typical operation of the invented system (Fig.2), though variations are possible the fresh water is filled in the fresh water well (15) to the specified level The water levels in the deep sea cold-water storage (16 &amp; 17) and warm surface water storage (18) are maintained at the specified levels. Vacuum pumping module (19) is turned on. After specified level of vacuum is reached in the vacuum chamber (20) the control valves are operated and the pressure in the Vaporizer module (21) and condenser module (22) is reduced to the specified level. The sea water level in the duct (23) and fresh water level in the duct (24) rise as vacuum builds up. Cold water is circulated through the heat exchanger (25) in the condenser module (22) at the required flow rate. The warm water<br><br>
from (18) is injected at the desired flow rate after required temperature is established in the heat exchanger (25) into the vaporizer module (21) through specially designed injection system (26) with devices to atomize the feed water into fine particles to provide large surface area to increase the evaporation rate.<br>
The injected warm water flash evaporates at the low pressure and vapour flows through the heat exchanger (25) in the condenser module(22). The water that is not evaporated collects at the bottom of the vaporizer module (21) and is discharged into the sea at required depth through the long discharge duct (23) at the bottom of the vaporizer module (21) which is partially filled with sea water and thus providing the barometric seal. Vapour flowing through the heat exchanger condenses and flows down to the fresh water well(15), through tire duct (24), which provides the barometric seal due to the height of the column and the vent (27) providing atmospheric pressure. From the well fresh water is collected into the fresh water storage (28) and pumped to on-shore facilities or transported for use as required.<br>
The control system ensures the supply of the specified quantity of fresh water by sensing and processing selected parameters during operation of the plant and operating the control system. The control system is provided with five control loops. The first one is for maintaining a constant level in the feed water storage tank. The level of the feed water is sensed by a level indicator and transmitted to the control unit, which processes the signal and commands an on-off control valve, which regulates the feed water supply to the feed water storage tank. The second one is for maintaining a constant level in the storage tank for cold water taken from ocean depth. The level of the cold water is sensed by a level indicator and transmitted to the control unit, which processes the signal and commands an on-off control valve, which regulates the cold-water intake to the storage tank. The third one is for injecting the required quantity of feed water into the vaporizer to maintain the production of the desired quantity of fresh water. The temperature of the feed water and the pressure inside the vaporizer are sensed and transmitted to the control unit. Depending upon the temperature of the warm water and the pressure inside the vaporizer, the algorithm computes the feed rate through the solution of the simultaneous equations goveming the flash vaporization. The control system commands the position<br><br>
of a proportional control valve, which injects the required warm water into the vaporizer. The fourth one is for circulating the required quantity of cold water through condenser accounting for variation in the temperature of the vapour flowing into condenser. The temperature of the vapour is sensed and transmitted to the control unit. In order to condense all the vapours, the cooling water feed to condenser is regulated by operating a proportional control valve, which regulates the quantity of flow of cooling water to condenser. The fifth one is for maintaining the vacuum at the required level in the system. The vacuum in the vaporizer, condenser, and vacuum pumping system are sensed and transmitted to the control unit which processes the signals and commands the proportional control valve feeding high pressure cold water to water jet ejector or commands the operation of other back up vacuum pumping devices.<br>
The lower end of the discharge duct (23) of the vaporizer can be connected to suitably designed under water distribution system with number of pipes discharging the water over a large area of the sea and at required depth to ensure safe and sustainable marine ecosystem.<br>
The vacuum pumping module configured is a combination of water jet ejectors and vacuum pumps. The primary driving fluid for the water jet ejectors is taken from the deep sea coolant water storage (16) and supplied at the required high pressure by high-pressure pumps.<br>
While particular embodiments of the present invention have been illustrated and described, it would be obvious to those skilled in the art that various other changes and modifications can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
The system as illustrated in Fig. (2) has the following salient features:<br>
i) The system has a special injection device (26) for injecting the warm surface water from the sea into the Vaporizer module (21). It is proposed to have a number of jets (impinging or swirl) to atomize the feed water into fine<br><br>
particles to provide larger surface area to enhance the evaporation rate.<br>
The Vaporizer module (21) has a barometric seal. The water, which is not, evaporated returns to the sea through a large long duct (23), the bottom of which is immersed in the sea. The Vaporizer is positioned at a height more than the barometric height above the sea surface so that under operating vacuum conditions the seawater rises and stays in the duct well below the injection plane and thus providing a seal to maintain operating vacuum in the Vaporizer and continuously discharging the injected water which is not evaporated into the sea by gravity. There is no requirement for a pump for discharging the water from the Vaporizer module (21).<br>
The lower end of the discharge duct (23) of the Vaporizer can be connected to a suitably designed under water distribution system with number of pipes discharging the water over a larger area of the sea and at required depth to ensure safe and sustainable marine eco system.<br>
The condenser module (22) also has a barometric seal. The condenser is positioned at a height more than the barometric height above the fresh water well (15). The bottom of the condenser is connected through a long large duct (24) to the fresh water well (15), which is vented to the atmosphere. During operations, the water from the fresh water well rises in the duct (24) which connects the well to the condenser and provides the seal to maintain operating vacuum in the condenser. Condensed fresh water is continuously discharged into the fresh water well (15) by gravity. There is no pump required for discharging the condensed fresh water from the condenser.<br>
The vacuum pumping module configured as combination of jet ejectors and vacuum pumps will have mainly water jets for which primary driving fluid is drawn from the deep sea Coolant Water Storage (16) and supplied at the required high pressure by a high pressure pump.<br><br>
The system is compact without requiring additional sources of energy supply such as solar pond, boilers and large structures as is used in other patented configurations. Depending upon the location of the plant, it can have on board generators for all its electrical energy supply or through cables from shore.<br>
Fig.-3 illustrates the design configuration of the injector (32) having a cavity into which the sea water from the upper strata of the sea enters tangentially at (29) and comes out axially at (30) as swirling conical jet (31) with minimum pressure drop across the injector (32).<br>
Fig.-4 illustrates the injector module (33) with 6 number of injectors (32) placed uniformly at a radius, around hub (34) with additional injector (35) at the centre of the hub (34) and the radial duct (36) connecting the hub (34) to the injectors (32) to feed the sea water at the required pressure and flow rate. The configuration design provides for increase or decrease in the number of the injectors around the hub in a radius and also increase the number of rows of injectors at a different radie around the hub (34).<br>
Fig.-5 illustrates the injector module cluster (37) with five numbers of injector modules (33) mounted on a torroid (38) for feeding the sea water to the injectors (32). The configuration design provides for increase or decrease in the number of injector modules and also modifications of the configuration of the torroid to different shapes. Fig.-6 illustrates the injector assembly (39) with 20 injector modules (33) mounted on 3 torroids (38) connected by a duct (40). The design provides for increase or decrease in the number of torroids and injectors and modifications in shapes. The layout of the injector modules are such that identical injector modules pairs (41) are placed coaxially to face each other in parallel planes separated by a distance enabling the swirling conical jets issuing from the injectors in one plane to impinge with the corresponding swirling conical jets issuing from the other.<br>
Fig.-7 illustrates the vapouriser-condenser assembly with the vapouriser (42) having an injector assembly (39) with 70 pairs of impinging conical swirl jets and connected to 4 condensers (43) located around the vapourizer and 2 gas bottles (44).   The<br><br>
configuration design provides for increase and decrease in the number or condensors, gas bottles and injectors. The utility of the vapouriser condenser assembly is to vapourise the injected sea water from upper strata of the sea and condense the vapors produced in the condenser using the cold sea water from the lower strata of the sea as cooling water.<br>
