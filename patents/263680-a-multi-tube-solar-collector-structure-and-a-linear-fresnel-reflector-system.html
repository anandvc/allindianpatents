				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a solar collector structure that employs a<br>
plurality of absorber tubes that are arranged to be illuminated by solar<br>
radiation from a reflector field and to transfer absorbed energy to a heat<br>
exchange fluid that is, in use of the structure, carried by the tubes. The<br>
invention has been developed in the context of a so-called compact<br>
linear Fresnel reflector (CLFR) system and is hereinafter described in<br>
relation to such a system. However, it will be understood that the<br>
invention may have broader application.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Prior art solar collector structures of the type with which the present<br>
invention might be compared may be categorised generally as falling<br>
within two groups; a first group that employs effectively a single<br>
absorber tube that extends along the focal line of a non-inverted<br>
trough-type reflector and a second group that employs a single absorber<br>
tube that extends along the focal line of an inverted trough-type<br>
reflector. Collector systems of the first group suffer the disadvantages<br>
that the absorber tube collects incident solar energy from one only<br>
reflector element and requires complex mounting and fluid coupling<br>
arrangements. Collector systems of the second group largely avoid the<br>
disadvantages of the first group but suffer the disadvantage of losses<br>
. occasioned by the need for multiple reflections, firstly from ground-<br>
mounted reflectors and then from the inverted trough reflectors.<br>
Moreover, collector systems of the second group (if not both groups)<br>
suffer a relatively high emissivity-to-absorptance ratio as a<br>
consequence, in part, of the surface area-to-aperture ratio attributable<br>
to the relatively large diameter tube required of a single-tube collector<br>
system. Furthermore, as a secondary issue, collector systems of both<br><br>
the first and second groups suffer loss of operating efficiency due to<br>
movement of unconfined heated air from the interior of the trough-like<br>
reflectors. Still further, as a tertiary issue, to the extent that the<br>
collector systems of the first and second groups employ a single<br>
absorber tube, those collector systems are not capable of providing for a<br>
variable absorption aperture.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a collector structure that is arranged to<br>
be located at a level above a field of reflectors and to receive solar<br>
radiation reflected from reflectors within the field. The collector<br>
structure comprises an inverted trough and, located within the. trough,<br>
a plurality of longitudinally extending absorber tubes that, in use, are<br>
arranged to carry a heat exchange fluid. The absorber tubes are<br>
supported side-by-side within the trough and each absorber tube has a<br>
diameter that is small relative to the aperture of the trough.<br>
The ratio of each absorber tube diameter to the trough aperture<br>
dimension may, for example, be in the range of 0.01:1.00 to 0.10:1.00<br>
and typically may be of the order of 0.03:1.00. With this arrangement<br>
the plurality of tubes will, in the limit, effectively simulate a flat plate<br>
absorber.<br>
The expressions "aperture of the trough" and "trough aperture" are both<br>
intended to be understood as defining, effectively, the opening of the<br>
trough through which incident radiation may pass to impinge on the<br>
absorber tubes.<br>
A plurality of the collector structures as above defined may be<br>
connected together co-linearly to form a row of the structures and, in<br>
such case, each of the absorber tubes will extend along the full row,<br>
either as a single length of tubing or as conjoined lengths of tubing.<br><br>
OPTIONAL FEATURES OF THE INVENTION<br>
The absorber tubes may be constituted by metal tubes and each tube<br>
may, if required, be coated over at least a portion of its surface with a<br>
solar absorptive coating. In an alternative arrangement, each absorber<br>
tube may comprise a glass or metal tubular component that is coated<br>
with a solar selective surface coating and a surrounding glass tubular<br>
component, with the space between the two tubular components being<br>
evacuated.<br>
The inverted trough may (but need not necessarily) be located in spaced<br>
relationship below a longitudinally extending roof and, in such case, an<br>
insulating material may be located in the space between the trough and<br>
the roof.<br>
A window that is substantially transparent to solar radiation may be<br>
employed to close (the aperture of) the trough and, in so doing, create a<br>
heat confining cavity within the trough. The window may be formed<br>
from a rigid material such as glass or it may, for example, be formed<br>
from a flexible plastics sheet material that is connected to marginal side<br>
wall portions of the trough. In this latter case the cavity may be<br>
pressurised to an extent sufficient to inflate the window in a direction<br>
away from the absorber tubes.<br>
The heat exchange fluid may in use of the collector structure be<br>
controlled to flow in parallel, unidirectional streams through the<br>
plurality of absorber tubes. Alternatively, means may be provided for<br>
selectively varying the channelling of the heat exchange fluid into and<br>
through the plurality of absorber tubes whereby the absorption<br>
aperture of the collector structure may, in use, effectively be varied.<br>
The invention will be more fully understood from the following<br>
description of an exemplary embodiment of the solar collector structure.<br><br>
The description is provided, by way of example, with reference to me<br>
accompanying drawings.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
As shown in Figures 1 to 3, the CLFR system comprises a field, of<br>
ground mounted reflectors 10 that are arrayed in rows 11 and further<br>
comprises parallel collector systems 12, each of which is constituted by<br>
aligned collector structures 13. A complete CLFR system might occupy<br><br>
a ground area within the range 5x101 m2 to 25x106 m2 and the system<br>
as illustrated in Figure 1 may be considered as a portion only of a larger<br>
CLFR system.<br>
The reflectors 10 may be of the type described in co-pending<br>
International Patent Applications numbered PCT/AU2004/000883 and<br>
PCT/AU2004/000884, filed 01 July 2004 by the present Applicant, and<br>
the disclosures of these Patent Applications are incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
The reflectors 10 are driven collectively or regionally, as rows or<br>
individually, to track movement of the sun (relative to the earth) and<br>
they are orientated to reflect incident radiation to respective ones of the<br>
collector systems 12, as shown schematically and by way of example in<br>
Figure 2. Also, some or all of the reflectors 10 may be driven so as to<br>
reorientate, when required, to change the direction of reflected radiation<br>
from one collector system 12 to another.<br>
In the system as illustrated in Figure 1, and as may typically be the<br>
case, each collector system 12 receives reflected radiation from twelve<br>
rows of reflectors 10. Thus, each collector system 12 receives reflected<br>
radiation from six rows at one side of the collector system and from six<br>
rows at the other side, although (as indicated in Figure 2) the reflecting<br>
rows that are associated with any one receiving collector system need<br>
not necessarily be located immediately adjacent that receiving collector<br>
system.<br>
Each rowl 1 of reflectorslO and, hence, each collector system 12 might<br>
typically have an overall length of 300 metres, and the parallel collector<br>
systems 12 might typically be spaced apart by 30 to 35 metres. The<br>
collector systems 12 are supported at a height of approximately 11<br>
metres by stanchions 14 which are stayed by ground-anchored guy<br><br>
wires 15, although other similar support arrangements might be<br>
employed.<br>
As indicated previously, each of the collector systems 12 comprises a .<br>
plurality of collector structures 13 that are connected together co-<br>
linearly to form a row of the structures. Each of the collector structures<br>
might typically have a length of the order of 12 metres and an overall<br>
width of the order of 1.4 metres.<br>
Each collector structure 13 comprises an inverted trough 16 which<br>
night typically be formed from stainless steel sheeting and which, as<br>
best seen in Figure 5, has a longitudinally extending channel portion 17<br>
and flared side walls 18 that, at their margins, define an aperture of the<br>
inverted trough. The trough 16 is supported and provided with<br>
structural integrity by side rails 19 and transverse bridging members<br>
20, and the trough is surmounted by a corrugated steel roof 21 that is<br>
carried by arched structural members 22.<br>
The void between the trough 16 and the roof 21 is filled with a thermal<br>
insulating material 23, typically a glass wool material, and desirably<br>
with an insulating material that is clad with a reflective metal layer. The<br>
function of the insulating material and the reflective metal layer is to<br>
inhibit upward conduction and radiation of heat from within the trough.<br>
A longitudinally extending window 24 is provided to interconnect the<br>
side walls 18 of the trough. The window is formed from a sheet of<br>
material that is substantially transparent to solar radiation and it<br>
functions to define a closed (heat retaining) longitudinally extending<br>
cavity 25 within the trough.<br>
The window 24 may be formed from glass but it desirably is formed<br>
from a transparent heat resistant plastics material having a thickness<br><br>
of the order of 60x10-6 m. As shown in Figure 7, side margins of the<br>
window may be welded to a wire or other heat resistant rope core 26<br>
and the window may be held in position by slideably locating the cored<br>
side margins in fluted side connectors 27.<br>
Figure 4 shows a collector structure 13 that is intended to be located at<br>
a terminal end of a row 12 of the collector structures, and it is provided<br>
with an end wall 28 to which is mounted a motor driven blower 29. The<br>
blower is provided in use to maintain a positive air pressure within the<br>
cavity 25 (relative to the ambient atmospheric pressure) and so to<br>
inflate the window in a direction away from absorber tubes 30 within<br>
the inverted trough 16.<br>
In the collector structure as illustrated, sixteen longitudinally extending<br>
stainless steel absorber tubes 30 are provided for carrying heat<br>
exchange fluid (typically water or, following heat absorption,<br>
water-steam or steam). However, the actual number of absorber tubes<br>
may be varied to suit specific system requirements, provided that each<br>
absorber tube has a diameter that is small relative to the dimension of<br>
the trough aperture between the side walls 19 of the trough, and the<br>
collector system might typically have between ten and thirty absorber<br>
tubes 30 supported side-by-side within the trough.<br>
The actual ratio of the absorber tube diameter to the trough aperture<br>
dimension may be varied to meet system requirements but, in order to<br>
indicate an order of magnitude of the ratio, it might typically be within<br>
the range 0.01:1.00 to 0.10:1.00. Each absorber tube30 might have an<br>
outside diameter of 33 mm. and, with an aperture dimension of, for<br>
example, 1100mm, the ratio of the absorber tube diameter to the<br>
aperture dimension will be 0.03:1.00.<br>
As indicated previously, with the above described arrangement the<br>
plurality of absorber tubes 30 will, in the limit, effectively simulate a flat<br><br>
plate absorber, as compared with a single-tube collector in a<br>
concentrating trough. This provides for increased operating efficiency,<br>
in terms of a reduced level of heat emission from the upper, non-<br>
illuminated circumferential portion of the absorber tubes. Moreover, by<br>
positioning the absorber tubes in the inverted trough in the manner<br>
described, the underside portion only of each of the absorber tubes is<br>
illuminated with incident radiation, this providing for efficient heat<br>
absorption in absorber tubes that carry steam above water.<br>
As illustrated in Figure 6, the absorber tubes 30 are freely supported by<br>
a series of parallel support tubes 31 which extend orthogonally between<br>
side walls 32 of the channel portion 17 of the inverted trough, and the<br>
support tubes 31 are carried for rotational movement by spigots 33.<br>
This arrangement accommodates expansion of the absorber tubes and<br>
relative expansion of the individual tubes. Disk-shaped spacers 34 are<br>
carried by the support tubes 31 and serve to maintain the absorber<br>
tubes 30 in spaced relationship.<br>
Each of the absorber tubes 30 is coated, along its length and around a<br>
(lower) portion of its circumference that is exposed to incident solar<br>
radiation, with a solar absorptive coating. The coating may comprise a<br>
solar selective surface coating that remains stable under high<br>
temperature conditions in ambient air or it may comprise a black paint<br>
that is stable in air under high-temperature conditions.<br>
Figure 8 of the drawings shows diagrammatically a flow control<br>
arrangement for controlling flow of heat exchange fluid into and<br>
through four in-line collector structures 13 of a collector system. As<br>
illustrated, each of the fluid lines 30A, B, C and D is representative of<br>
four of the absorber tubes 30 as shown in Figure 5.<br><br>
Under the controlled condition illustrated in Figure 8, in-flowing heat<br>
exchange fluid is first directed along forward line 30A, along return line<br>
30B, along forward line 30C and finally along and from return line 30D.<br>
This results in fluid at a lower temperature being directed through<br>
tubes that are located along the margins of the inverted trough and a<br>
consequential emission reduction when radiation is concentrated over<br>
the central region of the inverted trough. An electrically actuated<br>
control device 35 is provided to enable selective control over the<br>
channelling of the heat exchange fluid.<br>
Alternative fluid flow conditions may be established to meet load<br>
demands and/or prevailing ambient conditions, and provision may<br>
effectively be made for a variable aperture collector structure by closing<br>
selected ones of the absorber tubes. Thus, variation of the effective<br>
absorption aperture of each collector structure and, hence, of a<br>
complete collector system may be achieved by controlling the<br>
channelling of the heat exchange fluid in the alternative manners<br>
shown in Figures 9A to 9C.<br>
It is to be understood that the embodiment of the invention as<br>
described with reference to the drawings is presented solely as an<br>
example of one possible form of the invention. Thus, variations and<br>
modifications may be made in the embodiment of the invention as<br>
described without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention<br>
as defined in the appended claims.<br><br>

A MULTI-TUBE SOLAR COLLECTOR STRUCTURE<br>
AND A LINEAR FRESNEL REFLECTOR SYSTEM<br>
A collector system (12) is disclosed that comprises a row of<br>
linearly conjoined collector structures (13). The collector system is<br>
arranged to be located at a level above a field of reflectors (10) and to<br>
receive solar radiation reflected from the reflectors within the field. The<br>
collector structure (13) comprises an inverted trough (16) and, located<br>
within the trough, a plurality of longitudinally extending absorber tubes<br>
(30) that, in use, are arranged to carry a heat exchange fluid. The<br>
absorber tubes (30) are supported side-by-side within the trough and<br>
each absorber tube has a diameter that is small relative to the aperture<br>
of the trough. The ratio of the diameter of each absorber tube to the<br>
trough aperture dimension is of the order of 0.01:1.00 to 0.10:1.00 and,<br>
thus, the plurality of absorber tubes functions, in the limit, effectively to<br>
simulate a flat plate absorber.</td>
