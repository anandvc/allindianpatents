controlling apparatus 17.	'<br>
According to step 30, the request is received by the scrolling display request unit 10.<br>
In the preferred embodiment of the invention, the request is provided using a BSR (Burst Synchronous Responders, wherein 100kHz bursts on positive cycles of a 60Hz carrier are interpreted as logic-Is while 100kHz burst on negative cycles of the 60Hz carrier are interpreted as logic-0s) by a remote transmitter.<br>
According to step 32, a check is performed with the request.<br>
The check is performed against the database 18. More precisely, the check is performed in order to find out if the request is allowable or not.<br>
In the preferred embodiment, the check is performed by the processing unit 14, using the request and the database 18. It will be appreciated that the database 18 comprises a list of allowable codes.<br><br>
In the case where the request is allowable and according to step 34, the request is stored, by the processing unit 14, in the database 18.<br>
Now referring to Fig. 5, there is shown how the scrolling display apparatus is configured using the scrolling display controlling apparatus 17.<br>
According to step 40 a scrolling and a reading are performed. More precisely, the processing unit 14 provides a scrolling display moving control signal to the scrolling display moving unit 16 which moves the scroll. The photo detection unit 12 performs a reading of. a corresponding sequence of bar codes located on the moving scroll in order to detect a predetermined sequence of bar codes placed along an edge of the scroll.<br>
According to step 42, a check is performed in order to find out if a "start reading" code is located along the edge of the scroll.<br>
In the case where no "start reading" code is detected along the edge of the scroll, a scrolling and a reading are performed according to step 40.<br>
In the case where a "start reading" code is detected, a scrolling and a reading are performed according to step 44, the scrolling and the reading are performed in order to locate a data code. In fact, the skilled addressee will appreciate that, as explained above, a sequence of bar codes begins with the "start reading" code.<br>
According to step 46, the database 18 is updated by the processing unit 14 with a bar code read according to step 44.<br><br>
According to step 48, a check is performed in order to find out if the end of the sequence of bar codes is reached.<br>
In fact a sequence has a limited number of bar codes. Moreover and in a preferred embodiment of the invention, a "time-out" having a duration T is implemented. More precisely and in the case where no dark bar code is located during the duration T, a "time-out"•signal is provided by the photo-detection unit 12 to the processing unit 14. The "time-out" signal indicates that the end of the current sequence is reached.<br>
In the preferred embodiment of the invention, the duration T is equal to 100ms.<br>
In the case.where the end of the sequence of bar codes is not detected and according to step 44, the scrolling and the reading are performed according to step 44.<br>
In the case where the end of the sequence of bar codes is detected and according to step 50, a comparison is performed, by the processing unit 14, between the data code of the sequence of bar codes read and the request stored in the database 18.<br>
In the case where the data code of the sequence of bar codes read and the request stored in the database identify a same display, and according to step 54, a confirmation routine is performed in the preferred embodiment of the invention.<br>
More precisely, a scrolling and a reading are performed with at least one adjacent sequence of bar codes in order to confirm that the sequence of bar codes read and the request stored in the database 18 identify really the same, display.<br><br>
It will be appreciated that depending on the value of the code read and the request stored in the database 18, the . scrolling direction comprised in the scrolling display moving control signal may change.<br>
Now referring to Fig. 6, there is shown a flowchart which shows how a reading of a bar of a bar code is performed according to a preferred embodiment of the invention.<br>
According to step 60, the reading of a bar is performed by the photo-detection unit 12 during a duration of T ms. In fact, 200 readings are performed during the duration of T<br>
ms.<br>
According to step 62, a check is performed in order to find out if the detection of a bar is performed during the reading. It will be appreciated that in a preferred embodiment of the invention, a bar is detected in the case where at least half of the readings performed according to step 60 provide a detected signal indicative of a dark bar.<br>
In the case where a bar is detected and according to step 64, a flag is set on. It will be appreciated that the flag is used in order to update the memory while still reading the same bar. It will further be appreciated that the flag is set off in the case where a light bar is further read.<br>
According to step 66, the memory is updated.<br>
In an alternative embodiment of the invention, a counter may alternatively be used in order to count a number of bar.<br>
While the preferred embodiment of the invention discloses a scrolling display controlling apparatus adapted to control a single scrolling display, someone skilled in the art will<br><br>
appreciate that a scrolling display controlling apparatus may be used in order to control a plurality of scrolling displays.<br>
In the case for instance of a display adapted to provide   the price of gas, four single scrolling displays may be used, each of the scrolling displays being, used to display a digit.<br>
Now referring to Pig. 7, there is shown an example of the scrolling display controlling apparatus  17 adapted to   control the plurality of scrolling displays.<br>
The scrolling display controlling apparatus 17 comprises a plurality of photo detection units 12, a plurality of scrolling display moving units 16, a processing unit 14, a scrolling display request unit 10 and a database 18.<br>
 It will be appreciated that each of the plurality of photo detection units 12 is used with a corresponding scrolling display while each of the scrolling display moving unit 16 is used with a corresponding scrolling display.<br>
Preferably,   each  scrolling  display  is   controlled   independently of another one.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, a single scrolling display, having a moving scroll comprising more than one character to display, may be used.<br>
The skilled addressee will however appreciate that it is highly advantageous to have the scrolling display controlling apparatus 17 controlling n independent scrolling displays, wherein each independent scrolling display is used to display a single character, rather than having the scrolling display controlling apparatus  17<br><br>
controlling a single scrolling display, wherein the single scrolling display is used to display n characters.<br>
In the case for instance of gas, 3 digits are generally used in the United States in order to display the price of the gas. However usually 6 independent scrolling displays are used in order to provide a double-sided display.<br>
