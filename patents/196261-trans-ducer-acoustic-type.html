OBJECT OF THE INVEKTION<br>
This particular Invention Is regarding ellnnfnating 'carnet coloration' a phenomenon with audio speakers, it consists of a speedily designed diaphragm  made from soft materials Uri  rubber or soft P.V.C and In the case of composite diaphragms they are made both from rubber and hard materials Juice Teflon. An electroHTiechanicEA appardkus to overt doctorial signers Into vibrations. A presto electric diaphragm Is used to reproduce high frequency sounds. Mainly a cabinet Is made to enclose the rear surface of the daphragrn  lich Is vaccinated.  en vacancies the diaphragm which Is made of a soft material either In part or full defames and settles In an equilibrium position. Then It Is set to vibrate according to the electrical signal by electromechanical apparatus thus prodded  sound<br>
As there Is no material sedum or air towards the rear surface of the diaphragm and as sound cannot be created In or travel through vacuum no sound vexes are emitted Into the cabinet thus completely denudating the problem of  cabinet adoration'.<br>
BACIOSWOUNP OF IKVENTIOW;-<br>
Any speaker unit consists of one or prior drivers and an end sure. Every driver has three rib n parts namely:<br>
Diaphragm  Vice cod Magnetic apparatus<br>
The vodka cilia vibrates according to the electrical sigils, alarm  the uniform margined field created by the magnet apparatus and vibrates the daphragrn along vat It creating sound.<br><br>
Any diaphragm has to have tm surfaces and sound way  emptied from the front surface are Idol degree out of phase from the sound vexes emitted from the rear surface.   both surfaces are left free to atmosphere the sound  tees from either surfaces destructively Interfere thus producing wrong and waning or very poor quality of sound.<br>
That is the reason Way an enclosure is made for the rear surface of the diaphragm so that they don’t Interfere. But here arises a new position. The sound vitiates sifted from the rear surface of the diaphragm get reflected of the enclosure and collide v4th diaphragm and being mecfianical   ayes exert force on it.<br>
Simply sealing the sound waves from the rear surface of the diaphragm  cause air stiffness in the enclosure.<br>
Actually the capering vibrates according to the force created in the vice coil due to the current flog  along it.  Len the reflected waves from the enclosure collude the diaphragm the force exerted by them interacts the force from the voice cal thus producing cabinet coloration'.<br>
Due to the phenomenon of 'carnet coloration' any sepia err cannot just produce the frequency of sound as dictated by the signal but also produces another distortion frequency.<br>
The supplementary sound waves belt  of Niger frequency comprorrises the clarity of the sound heard.<br>
INVEWTTON;-<br>
Pacts<br>
This particular transducer consists mainly of three parts. Namely<br><br>
Diaphragm<br>
Electro -Mechanical Apparatus and<br>
Air tight vacounidsed enclosure.<br>
Parts 1 and 2 vary in their design, structure and composition according to the particular use of the transducer.<br>
DETAILED DE5CWPTI0N;-<br>
Di|)hra9n : The diaphragm used in this particular apparatus can be of three different types. Namely :-<br>
Simple Diapers   : A diaphragrn made from a soft material  rubber or soft P.V.C (Poly Vinyl Chloride) with hi  Posen’s ratio and low youn8;s and shear module that grossly, inspire of some in'egularities lolls ill   a dome.<br>
Composite Diaphra^n: This diaphragm consists of two parts.<br>
The center part is made from a hard-neat plastic material Teflon (polymer) or some lightwdght metal. This part of the composite also incorporates in It the voice CHOP of the magnetic type of electro Mschasilcai apparatus if used.<br>
It can have a flat or cone shaped profile.<br>
The peripheral rim part of the composite diaphragm is made from soft materials used in the case of simple one. It tail  the siege of a hollow truncated cane,<br>
Piezo-Bectiic Diaphragm : This type of dteiphragn consists of a thin layer of pies-electric crystal attached to a metal plate or sandvtrfched between two metal plates. If this type of diaphragm is used then there is no recjuircment for dectro-MadharAcak spurts as it can itself respond to electrical sfgials and produce<br><br>
vexations and thus sound Additionally a diaphragm Which Is a combination of herein above types can sago be used<br>
ELECTRC&gt;4\AECHANICALAPPAmTUS;-<br>
It Is the part traditionally found in other transducers that converts electrical signals into median cad vibrations.<br>
It can be principally of two types namely :-<br>
Magnetic lip : This type consists of magnetic apparatus and a voice chop. The magnetic apparatus creates a uniform magnetic filed along Vichy the cool rowels according to the current gloving along It. The votes camp being attached to the diaphragm transfers the vibrations created In to the dlaphragrt thus creating sound.<br>
Piesso-etectric Type : This type consists of a thin layer of pi€ZD-electr1c crystal attached to a metal plate or sandwiched between two mobs plates en electric signal is fed to the crystal It shr1nl<s and expands creating vibrations. as it is attached to the diaphoretic vibrations are transferred diaphragm thus sound.></s>
