Process for the production of beadlets<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the production of beadlets with a high concentration of an active ingredient selected from a fat soluble vitamin, a carotenoid and a polyunsaturated fatty acid, to the resulting beadlets and to compositions containing them.<br>
The prior art discloses fat-soluble vitamin powder compositions which are useful for administration as such and also for the formation of pharmaceutical dosage forms, for example, tablets, capsules, powders, and the like; and for the preparation of animal feeds. U.S. 2,756,177 discloses a process for preparing dry, free-flowing powders by forming an emulsion containing a vitamin-active material, water, gelatin, and/or gum acacia and a sugar; converting the emulsions to droplets; collecting the individual droplets in a mass of starchy powder in such a manner that the vitamin-active particles formed from the droplets are kept separated from each other until their particulate form is established; and separating the vitamin-active particles from the starchy collecting powder. The vitamin-containing powder prepared according to the above process is water soluble and exhibits satisfactory stability properties for most uses; however, the material does have problems withstanding the stresses of pelletizing when used for the fortification of animal feeds. The vitamin containing material tends to lose its physical integrity under the temperature, moisture, and pressure conditions of the feed pelleting process and results in a loss of the physical integrity of the product thereby compromising the stability of the fat-soluble vitamin.<br>
U.S. 4,670,247 relates to a vitamin-active preparation in the form of a water insoluble beadlet comprising the steps of forming an emulsion containing the vitamin-active material, water, gelatin, and a sugar; converting the emulsion to droplets; collecting the individual droplets in a mass of starchy powder in such a maimer that the vitamin-active particles from the droplets are kept separated from each other until their particulate is permanently established; separating the vitamin-active particles from the starchy collecting powder, and heat treating the particles at a temperature of from about 90°C to about<br>
22.06.05<br><br>
180°C. In accordance with this process, the heat treatment step insolubilizes the gelatin matrix of the beadlet by a reaction between the carbonyl group of the sugar with the free amino moieties of the gelatin molecule. The resulting beadlets are water-insoluble and exhibit increased stability to the stresses of feed pelleting. The crosslinking process utilizes the ingredients employed in making the beadlet and does not require addition of a crosslinking reagent or additive to the composition.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Starting from US U.S. 4,670,247 it is an important object of the invention to provide a vitamin-active preparation in the form of beadlets not only characterized by high stability and potency but also characterized with an increased concentration of the active ingredient. A further object is to provide a vitamin-active beadlet with a reduced loss of active ingredients in the surface region.<br>
More particularly the invention provides a process for the production of cross-linked beadlets containing one or more active ingredients selected from the group of a fat-soluble vitamin active material, a carotenoid and a polyunsaturated fatty acid, the process comprising treating a dry particulate form at a temperature in the range of from 90°C to 140°C for a time period of from 30 seconds to 30 minutes or from 1 minute to 10 minutes or from 3 minutes to 7 minutes.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Examples of a fat-soluble vitamin active material include vitamin bearing oils, provitamins and pure or substantially pure vitamins, both natural and synthetic, or chemical derivatives thereof and mixtures thereof. Of particular interest is a vitamin selected from the group of vitamins A, D, E and K, and derivatives thereof. For example, the term "Vitamin E" includes synthetically manufactured tocopherols or a mixture of natural tocopherols. Examples of vitamin derivatives include vitamin A acetate, vitamin A palmitate and vitamin E acetate. An example for a vitamin D-active material is vitamin D3. As a particular example, the process of the present invention may result in a beadlet containing a vitamin A-active material and a vitamin D-active material, e.g. vitamin A and vitamin<br><br>
In one embodiment the process of the invention may involve Vitamin A as fet-soluble vitamin active material in a total concentration in the range of from 500,000 IU vitamin A/g beadlet to 1,500,000 IU vitamin A/g beadlet, in the range of from 750,000 IU vitamin A/g beadlet to 1,500,000 IU vitamin A/g beadlet, or in the range of from 750,000 IU vitamin A/g beadlet to 1,300,000 IU vitamin A/g beadlet, e.g. vitamin A may be present in<br>
the beadlet in a total concentration of 500,000 ± 35,000 IU active ingredient/g beadlet,<br>
750,000 ± 35,000 IU active ingredient/g beadlet, of 1,000,000 ± 35,000 IU active<br>
ingredient/g beadlet, or of 1,100,000 ± 35,000 IU active ingredient/g beadlet Vitamin D as fat-soluble vitamin active material maybe present in the range of from 100,000 IU vitamin D/g beadlet to 500,000 IU vitamin D/g beadlet or in the range of from 100,000 IU vitamin D/g beadlet to 200,000 IU vitamin D/g beadlet, vitamin E as fat-soluble vitamin active material maybe present in the range of from 50 % to 75 % vitamin E.<br>
Examples for a carotenoid include (3-carotene, lycopene, zeaxanthin, astaxanthin, lutein, capsanthin and cryptoxanthin.<br>
In one embodiment the process of the invention may involve a carotenoid in a total concentration in the range of from 5 % to 20 %, in the range of from 5 % to 15 %, or in the range of from 7 % to 15 %.<br>
Examples for a polyunsaturated fatty add, as triglyceride and/or ethylester, include arachidonic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, docosahexaenoic acid and y-linolenic acid and/or ethylester.<br>
In one embodiment the process of the invention may involve a polyunsaturated fatty acid as triglyceride in a total concentration in the range of from 20 % to 50 %, in the range of from 25 % to 40 %, or in the range of from 28 % to 38 %.<br>
The dry particulate forms used in the process of the present invention may be prepared by any procedure known to the skilled artisan, e.g. by forming an aqueous emulsion containing the active ingredient, an emulsifier, a texturing agent and a reducing sugar, followed by converting the emulsion to a dry particulate form containing the non-aqueous constituents of said emulsion.<br>
Examples for an emulsifier are gelatine and ascorbyl palmitate. Gelatine is an emulsifier which at the same time functions as a texturing agent. Any gelatine which has a "bloom" in the range of practically zero to about 300 can be employed in the practice of the present invention. Both Type A and Type B gelatine can be employed. The preferred gelatine used<br><br>
is Bloom 140, but gelatine Bloom 30 or Bloom 75 would be possible as well. In the presence of gelatine no additional texturing agent maybe necessary.<br>
The concentration of the emulsifier depends on the kind of emulsifier used, e.g. gelatine may be present in a concentration in the range of from 25 % to 35 %, or less.<br>
Examples for a texturing agent beyond gelatine include carrageenan, modified starch, modified cellulose, xanthan gum, acacia gum, pectins, guar, caroub gums, maltodextrines and alginates.<br>
The concentration of the texturing agent depends on the kind of texturing agent used and maybe, e.g., in the range of from 0 % to 15 %.<br>
Examples for a reducing sugar are fructose, glucose, lactose, maltose, xylose, arabinose, ribose and sucrose. One type of sugar maybe used or a mixture of two or more sugars. The reducing sugar maybe added as such or in the form of a syrup, e.g. fructose or glucose syrop.<br>
The concentration of the reducing sugar depends on the kind of reducing sugar used and may be, e.g., in the range of from 2 % to 10 %, or in a ratio of gelatinersugar in the range of from 3:1 to 7:1, e.g. 5:1.<br>
Small quantities of other ingredients maybe incorporated including antioxidants like 6-ethoxy-l&gt;2-dihydro3cy-2,2,4-trimethylquinoline(ethoxyquine), 3,5-di-tertiary-4-butyl hydroxytoluene (BHT)and 3-tertiarybutyl-hydroxyanisole (BHA), humectants such as glycerol, sorbitol, polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, extenders and solubilizers.<br>
As a typical example gelatine and a suitable sugar maybe dissolved in water previously mixed with glycerin. The dissolution may last at 65-70°C for, e.g., about 30 minutes. Then, e.g., the vitamin A with the antioxidant may be added and emulsified. The pre-emulsification may be done with a colloid mill, e.g., based on a rotor/stator principle. The pre-emulsification may be hold for between 15 and 30 minutes at a rotation speed of the rotor between 500 and 1500 rpm and may then pass through a high pressure homogeniser resulting in a conversion of the emulsion to fine droplets.<br>
In one example the conversion of emulsion droplets to "set up" particles maybe attained by introducing a spray of emulsion droplets into an agitated cloud or suspension in air of the particles of the finely dispersed powder, e.g. by forcing the emulsion through a revolving spray head into a suspension in air of the powdered material, contained in and agitated by a revolving cylindrical drum, the drum and the spray head rotating in opposite<br><br>
directions so that the cloud or suspension of the powder in air is swirling in a sense of rotation opposite to the entering emulsion spray.<br>
Examples of the finely dispersed powder used in the process to collect/coat the droplets of the emulsion include polysaccharides such as starch and modified starch, and calcium silicate alone or a mixture of calcium silicate with one of the following mixture components: microcrystalline cellulose, magnesium silicate, magnesium oxide, stearic acid, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, hydrophilic silicic acid and kaolin. Coatings which consist of calcium silicate alone are preferred. The calcium silicate maybe present wholly or partially in the form of the hydrate.<br>
The calcium silicate particles are especially suitable when they have a size of less than 0.2 jam, especially less than 0.1 ^m, and a specific surface of at least about 80 m2/g to about 180 m2/g, preferably of about 95 m2/g to 120 m2/g, and are agglomerated to aggregates<br>
having an average size of about 5-30 jam, preferably 5-20 jam. The SiCVCaO ratio lies between 1.65 and 2.65.<br>
In coatings which consist of calcium silicate alone, the amount of calcium silicate maybe in the range of from 2 wt.% to 12 wt.%, preferably in the range of from 4 wt% to 9 wt.%.<br>
In coatings consisting of a mixture of calcium silicate with one or more of the aforementioned mixture components, the amount of the calcium silicate mixture maybe in the range of from 5 wt.% to 25 wt%.<br>
Optionally, the resulting dry particulate forms may be separated from the remaining finely dispersed powder. This maybe accomplished by operations which are conventional per se, including, e.g. simply to feed the mixture of powder and dry particulate forms to a shaking screen of a size selected to retain the dry particulate forms while passing the collecting powder.<br>
For further processing those dry particulate forms containing the active material are preferred having a moisture content of less than 10 % and preferably between about 4 to 6 percent If the moisture content is higher the dry particulate forms may be dried to the desired moisture content by various methods, e.g. by exposing them to air at room temperature or by moderate heating in a drying oven at 37°C to 45°C.<br>
The heat treatment may, e.g., be achieved in a batch or in a continuous process where the beadlet residence time and temperature are controlled.<br><br>
In the case of a fluid bed process, the beadlet is added either at the beginning in the case of the batch process or constantly in the case of a continuous fluid bed in a hot air or nitrogen stream having a temperature between 100 and 200°C, preferably between 130-160°C. The beadlet temperature is raised in a few second to one minute above 100°C enabling a quick and efficient reaction. The beadlet is ready after 5 to 10 minutes. The beadlet is cooled at the end of the treatment.<br>
In the case of a continuous flash treatment, the beadlet is fed continuously into a hot gas stream having a temperature between 100 and 200°C, preferably between 130-160°C. The beadlet can be moved by mechanical stirring, e.g., above 300 rpm. The wall of the vessel used to make this thermal treatment can also be heated to a temperature in the range of from 110 to 180°C The desired crosslinking of the beadlet may be reached in a time in the range of from 30 seconds to 10 minutes or from 1 minute to 10 minutes, with a maximum beadlet temperature in the range of from 90°C to 140°C, preferably from 105°C to 125°C.<br>
The beadlet forms resulting from the inventive process have a core and a surface region, wherein the loss of active ingredients in the surface region is reduced, and are also an object of the present invention.<br>
Therefore, the present invention further provides a beadlet form having a core and a surface region, wherein the core region contains, in a high concentration, one or more active ingredients selected from the group of a fat-soluble vitamin active material, a carotenoid and a polyunsaturated fatty acid, and the surface region contains less than 10 % of the total active ingredient content, preferably less than 5 % of the total active ingredient content<br>
In one embodiment the present invention provides a beadlet form containing one or more active ingredients selected from the group of Vitamin A in a total concentration in the range of from 800,000 IU vitamin A/g beadlet to 1,500,000 IU vitamin A/g beadlet or in the range of from 950,000 IU vitamin A/g beadlet to 1,250,000 IU vitamin A/g beadlet, in a total concentration in the range of from 100,000 IU vitamin D/g beadlet to 500,000 IU vitamin D/g beadlet or in the range of from 100,000 IU vitamin D/g beadlet to 200,000 IU vitamin D/g beadlet, vitamin E in a total concentration in the range of from 50 % to 75 %, a carotenoid in a total concentration in the range of from 5 to 20% and a polyunsaturated fatty acid in a total concentration in the range of from 5 to 50%, wherein the surface region contains less than 10 % of the total active ingredient content In another embodiment the surface region contains less than 5 % of the toltal active ingredient content<br><br>
The beadlets are characterized by high stability and potency. They exhibit high stability when pelletized, e.g. they withstand the temperature, moisture and pressure of a feed pelleting process without losing their physical integrity. They are water insoluble and maintain their properties in relation to bioavailability.<br>
Typical examples of beadlets of the present invention may, e.g. have the following components: 30 % to 45 % of vitamin A, 0 % to 2 % of vitamin D3,5 % to 15 % of 6-ethoxy-l^-dihydro^^^-trimethylquinoline (EMQ), 25 % to 35 % of gelatine, 5 % to 10 % of fructose, 2 % to 10 % of glycerine, 5 % to 10 % of calcium silicate, 0 % to 25 % of corn starch, 0 % to 1 % of edible fat, and water.<br>
