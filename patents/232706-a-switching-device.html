[Title of the Invention]  SWITCHING DEVICE<br>
 [Technical Field]<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a switching device for switching on and off by operation of an operation knob which swings, and more particularly to a waterproof-type switching device capable of preventing water from entering into its case. [Background Art]<br>
[0002]<br>
Fig. 11 is a side view schematically showing a structure of a switching device 100 used in a window open/close system (power window system) of a vehicle. The switching device 100 has a case 1, and switches, a circuit board and other components which will be described later are accommodated inside the case 1. A seesaw-motion type operation knob 6 of a window open/close switch is operated to open and close a window of the vehicle. The operation knob 6 has an operation section 6a, a cap section 6b formed integrally with the operation section 6a, and holes 6c formed on the side walls of the cap section 6b. A cylinder 7 is provided on an upper surface le of the case 1, and a shaft 7a is formed integrally with the outer wall of the cylinder 7. The cap section 6b of the operation knob 6 is attached to the cylinder 7 from above, and the holes 6c of the operation knob 6 are brought into engagement with the shaft 7a of the<br>
2<br><br>
cylinder 7 . By this engagement, the operation knob 6 is supported by the cylinder 7 such that the operation knob 6 can swing around the shaft 7a. An operation knob 4 is an operation knob of a door lock switch, and is operated to lock the doors of the vehicle such that the doors cannot be opened, and to release the lock. The switching device 100 is attached to an arm rest (not shown) provided on the door of the driver's seat of the vehicle, and is covered by a cover 11 shown in Fig. 3 in areas other than the positions of the operation knobs.<br>
[0003]<br>
Fig. 12 is a cross-sectional view showing a main part of the switching device 100 to which the cover 11 is attached. As apparent from the figure, the cylinder 7 is a hollow cylinder which is open to above and below to communicate with the inside of the case 1. A circuit board 14 is provided inside the case 1, and a switch 13 is packaged on the circuit board 14. The switch 13 is a switch for opening and closing a window, and is formed by a known slide switch. The switch 13 has an actuator 13a. An operation bar 12 connected to the operation knob 6 extends through a lower opening 7c of the cylinder 7 toward the inside of the case 1. A concave 12a is formed at the lower end of the operation bar 12. By engagement between the concave 12a and the actuator 13a of the switch 13, the motion of the operation knob 6 is transmitted through the operation bar 12 to the switch 13, and contacts equipped inside the switch 13<br>
3<br><br>
are switched between on and off in accordance with the operating position of the operation knob 6. A point Q is the rotation center of the operation knob 6, and corresponds to the position of the shaft 7a shown in Fig. 11. An opening lla through which the finger is inserted to operate the operation section 6a of the operation knob 6 is formed on the cover 11. The operation section 6a is exposed through the opening lla.<br>
[0004]<br>
A switching device having a similar structure as that of the switching device 100 explained above is shown in Patent References 1 and 2 identified below. Patent Reference 3 discloses a switching device having a similar structure as above, which is waterproofed by surrounding soldered portions of electronic component terminals on a circuit board with side walls formed by rubber contact members without requiring coatings.<br>
[0005]<br>
[Patent Reference 1]  JP-A-8-180755<br>
[Patent Reference 2]  JP-A-5-314864<br>
[Patent Reference 3]  JP-A-11-86662 [Disclosure of the Invention] <br>
[Problems that the Invention is to Solve]<br>
[0006]<br>
In the switching device 100 described above, the opening lla of the cover 11 is sized large enough to prevent any trouble<br><br>
4 <br>
which may be caused when putting the finger on the operation section 6a of the operation knob 6 to lower or raise the operation section 6a. As a result, raindrops entering through the window which has been left open, beverage accidentally spilt in the vehicle compartment or the like (hereinafter collectively referred to as “water”) flow through the opening lla toward the concave lib in some cases as illustrated in Fig. 12. In this case, the water entering the concave lib flows through a clearance 15 formed between a bottom wall llf of the concave lib and the cap section 6b of the operation knob 6 and through a clearance 16 formed between the bottom wall llf and the case 1 to be discharged to the outside. However, when a large amount of water flows into the concave lib, the water is not sufficiently discharged and flows through the clearance 15 into a space between the cap section 6b of the operation knob 6 and a side wall 7e of the cylinder 7. When the level of water staying in this space reaches the level of water in the concave lib and exceeds the height of the side wall 7e of the cylinder 7, water flows through an upper opening 7b into the cylinder 7. Then, the water coming into the cylinder 7 passes through the lower opening 7c of the cylinder 7 and enters into the case 1. Bold arrows shown in Fig. 12 indicate the flow path of the water.<br>
[0007]<br>
For overcoming this problem, it is considered that<br><br>
5 <br>
lengths A and B shown in Fig. 12 are widened. In this case, the discharge amount increases, thereby offering advantages to a certain extent. However, there is a limitation to widening the lengths A and B since design improvement and miniaturization considering the component arrangement within the case 1 are required. Thus, in the conventional switching device, water cannot be sufficiently discharged when a large volume of water flows into the concave lib at a time and thus entrance of water into the case 1 cannot be prevented.<br>
[0008]<br>
Nothing is described about prevention of water which enters from below the operation knob 6 in Patent Reference Nos. 1 and 2. Additionally, while Patent Reference No. 3 discloses a waterproofing technique for preventing short-circuit, entrance of water from below the operation knob into the case cannot be prevented in such a switching device which does not use rubber contacts according to the technique shown in this reference.<br>
[0009]<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the invention to provide a switching device capable of preventing water from entering from outside of a case through a space below an operation knob into the case.<br>
 [Means for Solving the Problems]<br>
[0010]<br><br>
6 <br>
A switching device according to the invention includes: a switch; a case within which the switch is accommodated; a hollow cylinder which is provided on the upper surface of the case and open to above and below to communicate with the inside of the case; an operation knob provided to cover the upper opening of the cylinder such that the operation knob can swing; and an operation bar which extends through the lower opening of the cylinder into the case to transmit the motion of the operation knob to the switch. A projection for preventing water from entering through a space between the operation knob and the cylinder into the case is provided on the upper surface of the case in the vicinity of the cylinder. The lower end of the operation knob is opposed to the upper end of the projection with a small clearance interposed there between when the operation knob is not shifted, and the lower end of the operation knob moves away from the upper end of the projection when the operation knob is shifted.<br>
[0011]<br>
In this structure, the projection prevents entrance of water which flows from below the operation knob and approaches the inside of the cylinder without obstructing the swinging motion of the operation knob. Even when an extremely small amount of water enters through the small clearance between the operation knob and the projection, the water is prevented from entering through the upper opening into the case since the<br>
7<br>
amount of water is small and the level of water staying in the space between the operation knob and the cylinder does not exceed the level of the upper opening of the cylinder. The switch according to the invention is not limited to a switch having a housing, but may be other switches such as a contact used for switching on/off of electrical current supply and a switching element itself. The projection provided on the case upper surface according to the invention may be a projection provided within a concave formed on the case upper surface. Additionally, the projection may be not only a projection contacting the case upper surface but also a projection not contacting the case supper surface. For example, a structure in which a projection is provided on the side surface of the cylinder with a space produced between the projection and the case is included in the scope of the invention.<br>
[0012]<br>
According to the invention, it is preferable that the space between the operation knob and the projection becomes the minimum equal to the small clearance when the operation knob is not shifted. In this structure, since the clearance between the operation knob and the projection becomes the minimum when the operation knob is at the neutral position, entrance of water into the case can be effectively prevented in the normal condition where the operation knob is not operated.<br>
8<br><br>
 [0013]<br>
According to the invention, it is preferable that the projection has a tapered surface which comes opposed to the operation knob when the operation knob is shifted. In this structure, the operation knob comes opposed to the projection when the operation knob is shifted. Since the distance between these components is decreased to such an extent that the swinging motion of the operation knob is not obstructed, entrance of water into the case can be effectively prevented not only when the operation knob is not shifted but also when the operation knob is shifted. The tapered surface may have a substantially circular-arc shape corresponding to a track defined by the lower end of the operation knob. In this structure, the distance between the operation knob and the projection when the operation knob swings can be further decreased and thus the waterproofing effect can be enhanced.<br>
 [Advantage of the Invention]<br>
[0014]<br>
According to the invention, the projection prevents entrance of water flowing from below the operation knob into the case without obstructing the motion of the operation knob. Therefore, the switching device can be effectively waterproofed.<br>
[Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention]<br>
[0015]<br><br>
9 <br>
An embodiment according to the invention is hereinafter described with reference to Figs . 1 through 7 .  In these figures, similar reference numerals are given to similar components.<br>
[0016]<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates an external appearance of an example of a switching device 100 used in a power window system. The switching device 100 has a case 1, and components such as a circuit board and switches which will be described later are accommodated inside the case 1. A concave 2 is formed on a part of an upper surface le of the case 1. Both ends of the concave 2 are opened and have slopes 3 inclined downward (Fig. 1 shows only one of the slopes 3) . Projections 8 are formed integrally with the case 1 within the concave 2, and have a function of preventing entrance of water into the case 1. The details of the projections 8 will be described later. An operation knob 4 of a door lock switch is operated for locking the doors of the vehicle such that they cannot be opened, or for releasing the lock. An operation knob 5 of a window lock switch is operated for locking the windows of the vehicle such that they cannot be opened nor closed, or for releasing the lock. Two operation knobs 6 of window open/close switches are operated for opening and closing the windows of the vehicle. The operation knob 4 and the operation knobs 6 are seesaw-motion type knobs capable of swinging like a seesaw, and the operation knob 5 is a knob formed by a lock-type push button. Each of<br><br>
10 <br>
the operation knobs 6 has an operation section 6a, a cap section 6b formed integrally with the operation section 6a, and holes 6c formed on the side walls of the cap section 6b. While one hole 6c on each operation knob 6 is shown in Fig. 1, the same hole as the hole 6c is actually formed on the side wall opposite to the side wall where the hole 6c is provided.<br>
[0017]<br>
Fig. 2 illustrates an external appearance of the switching device 100 in Fig. 1 from which the operation knobs 4, 5 and 6 are removed. Cylinders 7 are provided on the upper surface le of the case 1. Shafts 7a are formed integrally with the outer walls of each cylinder 7. The cylinders 7 are open to above, forming upper openings 7b. The shape of the horizontal cross section of the cylinders 7 is substantially rectangular in this embodiment, but the horizontal cross section of the cylinders 7 may have circular or other shapes. The projections 8 mentioned above are disposed in the vicinity of the respective cylinders 7. The projections 8 have approximately the same width as that of side walls 7e of the cylinders 7, and extend in a direction substantially parallel to the upper surface le of the case 1. The operation knob 5 shown in Fig. 1 is attached to a cylinder 9. The operation knob 4 shown in Fig. 1 is attached to a cylinder 10. In Fig. 2, the cap sections 6b of the operation knobs 6 shown in Fig. 1 are attached to the cylinders 7 from above to cover the upper<br><br>
11 <br>
openings 7b of the cylinders 7, and the holes 6c of the operation knobs 6 are brought into engagement with the shafts 7a of the cylinders 7. By this engagement, the operation knobs 6 are supported by the cylinders 7 such that the operation knobs 6 can swing around the shafts 7a.<br>
[0018]<br>
Fig. 3 illustrates an external appearance of the switching device 100 shown in Fig. 1 to which a cover 11 is attached. The cover 11 covers the switching device 100 other than the portions corresponding to the operation knobs 4 through 6 when the switching device 100 is fitted to an arm rest (not shown) equipped on the door of the driver' s seat of the vehicle. Two openings lla through which the finger is inserted for operating the operation sections 6a of the operation knobs 6 are formed on the cover 11. The operation sections 6a are thus exposed through the respective openings lla. An opening lie through which the operation knob 4 is exposed and an opening lid through which the operation knob 5 is exposed are also formed. Since the operation knobs 4 and 5 can be operated only by pushing those from above, the opening areas of the openings lie and lid are small. However, since the operation knobs 6 are lowered or raised with the finger put on the operation sections 6a, the opening areas of the openings lla are large. Hook pieces lie are equipped to attach the cover 11 to the arm rest.<br><br>
12 <br>
[0019]<br>
Fig. 4 is a cross-sectional view of a main part of the switching device 100 to which the cover 11 is attached- As apparent from the figure, the cylinder 7 is a hollow cylinder which opens to above and below to communicate with the inside of the case 1. A circuit board 14 is provided within the case 1, and a switch 13 is packaged on the circuit board 14. The switch 13 is a switch for opening and closing a window, and is formed by a known slide switch. The switch 13 has an actuator 13a. An operation bar 12 connected to the operation knob 6 extends through a lower opening 7c of the cylinder 7 toward the inside of the case 1. A concave 12a is formed at the lower end of the operation bar 12. By engagement between the concave 12a and the actuator 13a of the switch 13, the motion of the operation knob 6 is transmitted through the operation bar 12 to the switch 13, and contacts equipped inside the switch 13 are switched between on and off in accordance with the operating position of the operation knob 6. A point Q is the rotation center of the operation knob 6, and corresponds to the position of the shaft 7a shown in Fig. 1. This structure is the same as that of the switching device 100 shown in Fig. 12.<br>
[0020]<br>
Fig. 4 shows a condition where the operation knob 6 is not shifted, that is, the operation knob 6 is at the neutral position.  In this condition, the lower end 6e of the cap<br><br>
13 <br>
section 6b of the operation knob 6 (hereinafter abbreviated as “knob lower end”) and the upper end 8a of the projection 8 (hereinafter abbreviated as “projection upper end”) are opposed to each other with a small clearance Z interposed therebetween, as also illustrated in Fig. 5. The length of the clearance Z is approximately 0.5 mm, for example. When the operation knob 6 is shifted to open or close the window, the knob lower end 6e moves away from the projection upper end 8a. As apparent from Fig. 4, the proj ection 8 is disposed outside a clearance formed between the cap section 6b of the operation knob 6 and the side wall 7e of the cylinder 7. Thus, interference between the cap section 6b and the projection 8 caused when the operation knob 6 swings is prevented.<br>
[0021]<br>
The clearance between the knob lower end 6e and the projection upper end 8a increases as the knob lower end 6e shifts to the right from the projection upper end 8a. In this condition, water easily enters through the clearance. On the other hand, when the knob lower end 6e is shifted to the left from the projection upper end 8a, the projection 8 obstructs the swinging motion of the operation knob 6 in the semi-clockwise direction. It is therefore preferable to dispose the knob lower end 6e and the projection upper end 8a opposed to each other by setting the horizontal distance between the knob lower end 6e and the projection upper end 8a<br><br>
14 <br>
at zero or by locating the knob lower end 6e at a position slightly to the right from the projection upper end 8a.<br>
[0022]<br>
The clearance between the operation knob 6 and the projection 8 becomes the minimum, i.e., the small clearance Z mentioned above, when the operation knob 6 is located at the neutral position shown in Fig. 4. When the operation knob 6 swings anticlockwise from the neutral position, a clearance Zl between the operation knob 6 and the projection 8 becomes larger than the clearance Z as shown in Fig. 6. When the operation knob 6 swings clockwise from the neutral position, a clearance Z2 between the operation knob 6 and the projection 8 also becomes larger than the clearance Z as shown in Fig. 7.<br>
[0023]<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 5, the projection 8 has a tapered surface 8b which is inclined diagonally downward from the upper end 8a. The tapered surface 8b comes opposed to the cap section 6b of the operation knob 6 when the operation knob 6 swings anticlockwise (i.e., in the direction where the knob lower end 6e approaches the side wall 7e of the cylinder 7) . The tapered surface 8b has a substantially circular-arc-shaped tapered surface which corresponds to a track defined by the knob lower end 6e when the operation knob 6 swings around the Q point (Fig. 4) , that is, a track of a circle having a center of  the  Q  point<br><br>
15 <br>
(shown by an alternate long and short dash line) . A distance S between the track formed by the knob lower end 6e and the tapered surface 8b is set at approximately 0.5 mm which is equal to the clearance Z.<br>
[0024]<br>
By providing the projection 8 having the structure explained above, entrance of water from below the operation knob 6 into the case 1 can be prevented. More specifically, water entering into the concave lib of the cover 11 flows out of the concave lib through a clearance 15 between a bottom wall llf of the concave lib and the cap section 6b of the operation knob 6, and most of the water is then blocked by the projection 8 and flows into the concave 2 as shown by a bold arrow in Fig. 4. Since the concave 2 is open at the both ends as illustrated in Fig. 1, the water coming to the concave 2 is discharged from the both sides of the concave 2 to the outside. Since the slopes 3 inclined downward are provided at the open ends of the concave 2, the water within the concave 2 can be smoothly discharged along the slopes 3. When a large amount of water flows into the concave lib, the water enters through the small clearance Z between the operation knob 6 and the projection 8 by water pressure. However, since the amount of water entering therethrough is extremely smaller than that amount in the structure not including the projection 8, the level of water staying in the space between the cap section 6b of the operation<br><br>
16 <br>
knob 6 and the side wall 7e of the cylinder 7 does not exceed the height of the side wall 7e. Accordingly, entrance of water from the upper opening 7b through the lower opening 7c of the cylinder 7 into the case 1 can be prevented.<br>
[0025]<br>
The clearance between the operation knob 6 and the projection 8 becomes the minimum equivalent to the small clearance Z when the operation knob 6 is not shifted. Thus, entrance of water into the case 1 can be effectively prevented in the normal condition where the operation knob 6 is not operated. Moreover, the tapered surface 8b of the projection 8 opposed to the operation knob 6 when the operation knob 6 is shifted is provided in this embodiment. Thus, entrance of water into the case 1 can be effectively prevented not only when the operation knob 6 is not shifted but also when the operation knob 6 is shifted by decreasing the opposing distance between the operation knob 6 and the tapered surface 8b to such an extent that the motion of the operation knob 6 is not obstructed. Furthermore, since the tapered surface 8b has the substantially circular-arc shape corresponding to the track defined by the knob lower end 6e, the distance between the operation knob 6 and the projection 8 when the operation knob 6 is shifted can be decreased. Accordingly, the waterproofing effect can be enhanced.<br>
[0026]<br><br>
17 <br>
Figs. 8 and 9 illustrate an example of the switching device 100 in another embodiment according to the invention. Fig. 8 shows an external appearance of the switching device 100 from which the operation knobs 6 are removed. Fig. 9 is a side view showing the switching device 100 to which the operation knobs 6 are attached. In the respective figures, similar reference numerals are given to similar components shown in Figs. 1 through 7. A concave 21 is formed on the case 1. Slopes 31 are formed at both open ends of the concave 2 (one of the slopes 31 is shown in Figs. 8 and 9) . Projections 81 are formed integrally with the case 1 within the concave 21.<br>
[0027]<br>
While the projections 8 are disposed along one side of the concave 2 (on the cylinder 7 side) in Fig. 2, the projections 81 are positioned in the middle of the concave 21 in Fig. 8. The shape of the projections 81 is the same as that of the projections 8. The depth of the concave 21 is smaller than that of the concave 2 shown in Fig. 2. The area of the slopes 31 is smaller than that of the slopes 3 shown in Fig. 2. Similarly to the above embodiment, entrance of water into the case 1 can be prevented by the projections 81 in this embodiment.<br>
[0028]<br>
Figs. 10 (a) and 10 (b) are enlarged cross-sectional views<br><br>
18 <br>
showing a main part of the switching device 100 in still other embodiments according to the invention. Fig. 10(a) shows an example in which the width W of the projection 8 in the horizontal direction is smaller than that width in the structure shown in Fig. 5. This figure shows a condition where the operation knob 6 is not shifted but is located at the neutral position. If waterproofing is required only when the operation knob 6 is at the neutral position, the projection 8 having such a small width as in this example is sufficient. Fig. 10(b) shows an example in which a tapered surface 6f is formed on the cap section 6b of the operation knob 6 at the position opposed to the tapered surface 8b of the projection 8. The tapered surface 6f has a substantially circular-arc shape similar to the substantially circular-arc shape of the tapered surface 8b. This figure shows a condition where the operation knob 6 is shifted. In this condition, the clearance between the tapered surfaces 6f and 8b is kept constant in the range that those tapered surfaces are opposed to each other, and is decreased to the minimum to such an extent that the swinging motion of the operation knob 6 is not obstructed. As a result, the waterproofing effect can be further enhanced. <br>
[0029]<br>
As apparent from the above embodiments, when spilt beverage or the like flows through the openings lla into the concaves lib of the cover 11, the water approaching the inside<br><br>
19 <br>
of the cylinders 7 is blocked by the projections 8 or 81. Even when an extremely small amount of water enters through the small clearances Z, the water is prevented from entering from below the operation knobs 6 through the upper openings 7b of the cylinders 7 into the case 1 since the amount of water is small. Accordingly, the switching device 100 can be effectively waterproofed.<br>
[0030]<br>
In the respective embodiments described herein, the invention is applied to the switching device used in the power window system. However, the invention is also applicable to switching devices used in door open/close systems or other devices. Furthermore, the invention is applicable to switching devices used for purposes other than vehicle equipment. [Brief Description of the Drawings]<br>
