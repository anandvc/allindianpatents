				<td>SOLID PHASE BENZOPYRAN COMPOSITION. PROCESS FOR PREPARING<br>
SAME AND ORGANOLEPTIC USES THEREOF<br>
FTELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a novel solid phase fragrance product comprised of predominately l,3,4,6,7,8-hexahydro-4,6,6,7,8,8-hexamethylcyclopenta[G]-2-benzopyran and further comprising additional benzopyran materials. The fragrance product can be used in perfume compositions and consumer products.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The liquid phase benzopyi'an composition containing from 70 - 81% by weight of l,3,4,6,7,8-hexahydro-4,6,6,7,8,8-hexamethylcyclopenta[G]-2-benzopyran having the structure:<br>
Formula Removed<br>
(known as "GALAXOLIDE 100', registered trademark of International Flavors &amp; Fragrances Inc. of New York, N.Y.) and solutions thereof, for example, 50% solutions in diethyl phthalate (known as "GALAXOLIDE 50", registered trademark of International Flavors &amp; Fragrances Inc. of New York, N.Y.) are among the largest volume aroma , chemicals currently in use in commerce. The material is known to impart to consumable materials including fine fragrances and perfumes for use in functional products such as soaps and detergents, a tenacious and substantive musk aroma. As manufactured, the liquid phase benzopyran composition known as "GALAXOLIDE" contains 70-75% by weight of l,3,4,6,7,8-hexahydro-4,6,6,7,8,8-hexamethylcyclopenta[G]-2-benzopyran having the structure:<br>
Formula Removed<br>
which structure contains four diastereomeric isomers including the 4R-cis and trans isomers and the 4S-cis and trans isomers. Frater et al.I, U.S. Patent 5,635,471, the specification of which is herein incorporated by reference, discloses that the mixture of the 7R and 7S diastereoisomers have a stronger musk aroma and Frater et al. n, Helvetica Chimica Acta. Vol. 82,1999, pp. 1656-1665 discloses that the strongest isomer is the (-)-(4S,7R) isomer. GALAXOLDDE as commercially produced and as taught by the art to be produceable, for example, U.S. Patent 3,360,530, the specification for which is herein incorporated by reference, consists of a thick, viscous liquid which can solidify at cold temperatures, for example at 0°C. It is well known to those skilled in the art that this material is difficult to handle either as the highly concentrated viscous liquid or as diluted in a solvent such as diethyl phthalate benzyl benzoate, isopropyl myristate and/or dipropylene glycol. Typically, it is diluted so that the major isomers, indicated by the structure:<br>
Formula Removed<br>
make up 50% of the solution, by weight. As currently manufactured, and as disclosed in the prior art, GALAXOLIDE has been reported to have some adverse environmental effects. Accordingly, a need exists to provide a form of GALAXOLIDE that can be used in perfumes, colognes and perfumed articles in substantially lower dosages than heretofore known in the art, thereby protecting the environment.<br>
Solid forms of GALAXOLIDE are disclosed in the prior art, including<br>
(a)	Sprecker, U.S.Patent 4,650,603, the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference; and<br>
(b)	Frater et al. n,U.S. PATENT 5,635,471.<br>
However, the solid forms of GALAXOLIDE so disclosed in the prior art do not contain the necessary and desirable high percentages, 85-95 weight % of the isomers having the structure:<br>
Formula Removed<br>
which high percentages cause the solid phase benzopyran compositions of our invention to have unobvious, unexpected and advantages organoleptic properties regarding aroma quality, strength and substantivity.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
We have discovered a novel form of a mixture of benzopyran isomers which in the form of a granular, white powdery substance have surprisingly easy handling capabilities. Accordingly, the novel composition of our invention is easily dosed into fragrance formulations. Compared to the currently used forms of GALAXOLIDE, substantially lesser quantities of the novel solid phase benzopyan compositions of our invention are required to provide the same organoleptic musk nuances as provided by the higher amounts of the prior art benzopyran compositions currently used. Accordingly, as a result of the commercial use of the compositions of our invention, and replacement of prior art benzopyran compositions with the solid phase benzopyran compositions of our invention, emissions to the environment of benzopyrans will be significantly reduced.<br>
More specifically, our invention is directed to a solid phase benzopyran composition consisting essentially of from about 85 weight % up to about 95 weight % of 1,3,4,6,7,8-hexahydro-4,6,6,7,8,8-hexamethylcyclopenta[G]-2-benzopyran having the structure:and further comprising at least one benzopyran selected from the group consisting of<br>

A second process comprising the steps of:<br>
i.        admixing a liquid phase benzopyran composition consisting essentially of from about 70 weight % up to about 81 weight % of 1,3,4,6,7,8-hexahydro-4,6,6,7,8,8-hexamethylcyclopenta[G]-2-benzopyran;<br>

The solid phase benzopyran composition of our invention and one or more auxiliary perfume ingredients including, for example, aldehydes, nitrites, esters, cyclic esters, ketones, ethers other than the solid phase benzopyran compositions of our invention, natural essential oils, synthetic essential oils, terpene mercaptans and hydrocarbons may be admixed so that the combined odors of the individual components produces a pleasant and desired fragrance particularly in the musk and "animal-like" fragrance area. The solid phase benzopyran compositions of our invention, even in relatively low concentrations, e.g., 0.005% will impart a sweet, musk "animal-like" aroma to fine fragrances, soaps, anionic, cationic, non-ionic and zwitterionic detergents, fabric softener compositions, fabric softener articles, e.g., BOUNCE® registered trademark of the Procter &amp; Gamble Co. of Cincinnati, Ohio, space odorants and<br>
deodorants, sun screens, powders such as talcs, hair preparations and fabric conditioners. Accordingly, the concentration of the solid phase benzopyran composition of our invention taken alone or in admixture with one or more auxiliary perfume ingredients that can be used in fine fragrances or perfumed articles or perfumed polymers can vary from about 0.005% up to about 50% by weight of the fine fragrance or fragranced article preferably from about 0.01 to about 20 and more preferably from about 0.1 weight percent to 10 weight percent. In other embodiments of our invention, the novel compounds of our invention can be incorporated from about 0.005% up to about 5% by weight of the perfumed article, or from about 0.005% up to about 50% by weight of the perfumed article, for example, high density polyethylene as more specifically disclosed in U.S. Patent 6,090,774 the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference.<br>
In addition, the perfume composition or fragrance composition of our invention can contain a vehicle or carrier for the solid phase benzopyran composition of our invention, taken alone or further together with one or more auxiliary perfume ingredients. The vehicle can be a liquid such as a non-toxic alcohol, e.g., ethanol, a non-toxic glycol, such as dipropylene glycol, or the like. The carrier can be an absorbent solid such as a gum, including gum arabic, guar gum or carageenah gum or components for microencapsulating the composition using, for example, an encapsulating polymeric matrix such as a polyurethane matrix or a urea-formaldehyde matrix or a modified starch matrix, or components for encapsulating the solid phase benzopyran composition particles such as gelatin by means of coacervation.<br>
