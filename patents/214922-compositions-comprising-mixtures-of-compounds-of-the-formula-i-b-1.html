"COMPOSITIONS COMPRISING MIXTURES OF COMPOUNDS OF<br>
THE FORMULA (I-b-1)"<br>
BAYER AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT, a body corporate organized under the laws of Germany, of D-51368 Leverkusen, Germany,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br>
-"9 AUG 2007<br><br>
The present invention relates to novel active compound combinations comprising known cyclic ketoenols on the one hand and other known insecticidally active compounds on the other hand and which are highly suitable for controlling animal pests such as insects and undesired acarids.<br>
It is already known that certain cyclic ketoenols have insecticidal and acaricidal properties (EP-A-528 156). WO 95/01971, EP-A-647 637, WO 96/16061, WO 96/20196, WO 96/25395, WO 96/35664, WO 97/02243, WO 97/01535, WO 97/36868, WO 97/43275, WO 98/05638, WO 98/06721, WO 99/16748, WO 99/43649, WO 99/48869 and WO 99/55673 describe further ketoenols having insecticidal and acaricidal properties. The activity of these substances is good; however, at low application rates it is sometimes unsatisfactory.<br>
Furthermore, it is already known that numerous heterocycles, organotin compounds, benzoylureas and pyrethroids have insecticidal and acaricidal properties (cf. WO 93/22 297, WO 93/10 083, DE-A-2 641 343, EP-A-347 488, EP-A-210 487, US 3,264,177 and EP-A-234 045). However, the activity of these substances is not always satisfactory.<br>

Surprisingly, the insecticidal and acaricidal action of the active compound combinations according to the invention considerably exceeds the total of the actions of the individual active compounds. A true synergistic effect which could not have been predicted exists, not just a complementation of action.<br>
The active compound combinations according to the invention comprise, in addition to at least one active compound of the formula (I), at least one active compound of compounds 1 to 23.<br>
Preference is given to active compound combinations comprising compounds of the formula (I)<br>

In addition, the active compound combinations may also comprise other fungicidally, acaricidally or insecticidally active components which may be admixed.<br>
If the active compounds are present in the active compound combinations according to the invention in certain weight ratios, the synergistic effect is particularly pronounced. However, the weight ratios of the active compounds in the active compound combinations may be varied within a relatively wide range. In general, the combinations according to the invention comprise active compounds of the formula (I) and the co-components in the preferred and particularly preferred mixing ratios indicated in the table below:<br>

These formulations are produced in a known manner, for example by mixing the active compounds with extenders, that is, liquid solvents and/or solid carriers, optionally with the use of surfactants, that is, emulsifiers and/or dispersants, and/or foam formers.<br>
If the extender used is water, it is also possible, for example, to use organic solvents as cosolvents. The following are essentially suitable as liquid solvents: aromatics such as xylene, toluene or alkylnaphthalenes, chlorinated aromatics or chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons such as chlorobenzenes, chloroethylenes or methylene chloride, aliphatic hydrocarbons such as cyclohexane or paraffins, for example mineral oil fractions, mineral and vegetable oils, alcohols such as butanol or glycol and their ethers and esters, ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone or cyclohexanone, strongly polar solvents such as dimethylformamide and dimethyl sulphoxide, or else water.<br>
Suitable solid carriers are:<br>
for example ammonium salts and ground natural minerals such as kaolins, clays, talc, chalk, quartz, attapulgite, montmorillonite or diatomaceous earth, and ground synthetic materials such as highly-disperse silica, alumina and silicates; suitable solid carriers for granules are: for example crushed and fractionated natural rocks such as calcite, marble, pumice, sepiolite and dolomite, or else synthetic granules of inorganic and organic meals, and granules of organic material such as sawdust, coconut shells, maize cobs and tobacco stalks; suitable emulsifiers and/or foam formers are: for example nonionic and anionic emulsifiers such as polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene fatty alcohol ethers, for example alkylaryl polyglycol ethers, alkylsulphonates, alkyl sulphates, arylsulphonates, or else protein hydrolysates; suitable dispersants are: for example lignin-sulphite waste liquors and methylcellulose.<br>

Some or all of the abovementioned binder can be replaced by a fixative (mixture) or plasticizer (mixture). These additives are intended to prevent volatilization of the active compounds, and also crystallization or precipitation. They preferably replace 0.01 to 30% of the binder (based on 100% of binder employed).<br>
The plasticizers are from the chemical classes of the phthalic esters, such as di butyl phthalate, dioctyl phthalate or benzyl butyl phthalate, phosphoric esters such as tributyl phosphate, adipic esters such as di-(2-ethylhexyl)-adipate, stearates such as butyl stearate or amyl stearate, oleates such as butyl oleate, glycerol ethers or higher-molecular-weight glycol ethers, glycerol esters and p-toluenesulphonic esters.<br>
Fixatives are based chemically on polyvinyl alkyl ethers such as, for example, polyvinyl methyl ether, or ketones such as benzophenone and ethylenebenzophenone.<br>
Other suitable solvents or diluents are, in particular, water, if appropriate as a mixture with one or more of the abovementioned organochemical solvents or diluents, emulsifiers and dispersants.<br>
Particularly effective timber protection is achieved by industrial-scale impregnating processes, for example the vacuum, double-vacuum or pressure processes.<br>
The active compound combinations according to the invention can at the same time be employed for protecting objects which come into contact with saltwater or brackish water, such as hulls, screens, nets, buildings, moorings and signalling systems, against fouling.<br>

All plants and plant parts can be treated in accordance with the invention. Plants are to be understood as meaning in the present context all plants and plant populations such as desired and undesired wild plants or crop plants (inclusive of naturally occurring crop plants). Crop plants can be plants which can be obtained by conventional plant breeding and optimization methods or by biotechnological and recombinant methods or by combinations of these methods, inclusive of the transgenic plants and inclusive of the plant varieties protectable or not protectable by plant breeders' rights, such as shoot, leaf, flower and root, examples which may be mentioned being leaves, needles, stalks, stems, flowers, fruit bodies, fruits, seeds, roots, tubers and rhizomes. The plant parts also include harvested material, and vegetative and generative propagation material, for example cuttings, tubers, rhizomes, offsets and seeds.<br>
Treatment according to the invention of the plants and plant parts with the active compounds is carried out directly or by allowing the compounds to act on the surroundings, environment or storage space by the customary treatment methods, for example by immersion, spraying, evaporation, fogging, scattering, painting on and, in the case of propagation material, in particular in the case of seed, also by applying one or more coats.<br>
The good insecticidal and acaricidal action of the active compound combinations according to the invention can be seen from the examples which follow. While the<br>
33<br><br>
Le A 34 226-Foreign Countries<br>
-33-<br>
individual active compounds show weaknesses in their action, the combinations show an action which exceeds a simple sum of actions.<br>
A synergistic effect in insecticides and acaricides is always present when the action of the active compound combinations exceeds the total of the actions of the active compounds when applied individually.<br>
The expected action for a given combination of two active compounds can be calculated as follows, using the formula of S.R. Colby, Weeds JL5 (1967), 20-22:<br>
If<br>
X is the efficacy, expressed as % of the untreated control, when employing active compound A at an application rate of m g/ha or in a concentration of m ppm,<br>
Y is the efficacy, expressed as % of the untreated control, when employing active compound B at an application rate of n g/ha or in a concentration of n ppm and<br>
E	is the efficacy, expressed as % of the untreated control, when employing<br>
active compounds A and B at application rates of m and ng/ha or in a concentration of m and n ppm,<br>
then<br><br>
If the actual insecticidal kill rate exceeds the calculated value, the action of the combination is superadditive, i.e. a synergistic effect is present. In this case, the<br>
34<br><br>
Le A 34 226-Foreign Countries<br>
-34-<br>
actually observed insecticidal kill rate must exceed the value calculated using the above formula for the expected insecticidal kill rate (E).<br>
After the desired period of time, the kill in % is determined. 100% means that all animals have been killed; 0% means that none of the animals have been killed.<br>

Use Example<br>
Bemisia test<br>
Solvent:	7.5 parts by weight of dimethylformarnide<br>
Emulsifier:	2.5 parts by weight of alkylaryl polyglycol ether<br>
To produce a suitable preparation of active compound, 1 part by weight of active compound is mixed with the stated amounts of solvent and emulsifier, and the concentrate is diluted with water to the desired concentration.<br>
Cotton plants (Gossypium hirsutum) which are infested with eggs, larvae and pupae of the whitefly Bemisia tabaci are immersed in a preparation of active compound of the desired concentration.<br>
After the desired period of time, the kill in % is determined. 100% means that all animals have been killed; 0% means that none of the animals have been killed.<br>
In this test, for example, the following active compound combinations in accordance with the present application exhibit a synergistically enhanced activity compared to the active compounds applied individually.<br><br>
