In order to control various kinds of insect pests, the compound of the present invention may be suitably applied to crops which are expected to create insect pests or places where such creation is not desired in an amount effective in controlling insect pests as intact, as appropriately diluted with water or the like, or as suspended, and used accordingly. The amount thereof is varied according to various factors such as purpose, target insect pests, reared status of crops, occurrence trend of insect pests, weather, environmental conditions, the type of formulation, method of application, place of application, time of application and the like.  However, usually, the amount is preferably at a concentration of 0.0001 ppm to 5000 ppm and preferably at a concentration of 0.01 ppm to 1000 ppm as an active ingredient. Furthermore, the application amount is generally from 1 to 300 g per 10 are as an active ingredient.<br>
The insecticide comprising the compound represented by the<br>
general formula (1) or (5)  of the present invention as an active ingredient may be used singly for preventing insect pests such as various agricultural, forest and horticultural insect pests, stored grain insect pests, hygienic insect pests, nematodes or the like which are injurious to paddy rice, fruit trees, vegetables, other crops, flowers and the like.  Also, it may be used in combination of one or more kinds of other insecticides and/or fungicides in order to obtain a much higher control effect on controlling various diseases and insect pests occurring at the same time.<br>
