				<td>Sliding element: and process for its production<br>
The invention relates to a sliding element with a<br>
formative support layer and an electrodeposited sliding<br>
layer thereon which is formed from an alloy with the<br>
alloy constituents tin, antimony and copper, the<br>
fractions of which in % by weight are<br>
antimony 5 to 20%,<br>
copper 0.5 to 20%,<br>
remainder tin,<br>
where the content of lead is 
content of other fractions is 
The invention also relates to a process for producing a<br>
sliding element by electrolytically applying a sliding<br>
layer of an alloy with the alloy constituents tin,<br>
antimony and copper to a formative support layer.<br>
A sliding bearing layer of the type mentioned at the<br>
start is known, for example, through DE 82 06 353 U1.<br>
Here, the sliding bearing layer is electrodeposited<br>
onto a support layer which is located on a steel<br>
support pan. The sliding bearing layer has a thickness<br>
of about 20 µm. It is also desired that the copper<br>
content of the sliding bearing layer is below 0.5% by<br>
weight because a higher copper content, according to<br>
the objection, has a harmful effect on the fatigue<br>
strength of the sliding bearing layer.<br>
In practice, the known sliding bearing layer is<br>
produced electrolytically using a wetting agent which<br>
is sold under the name Igepal CO 880 by Rhodia Novecare<br>
and is a nonylphenol ethoxylate with 30 ethoxy (EO)<br>
units. The electrolytic layer construction takes place<br>
with a columnar crystallization and permits no useful<br>
layers which are essentially larger than 20 µm.<br>
Consequently, the service life of the sliding bearing<br>
layers is naturally very restricted on account of the<br>
unavoidable abrasion.<br><br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
sliding bearing layer with improved use properties.<br>
According to the invention, this object is achieved<br>
with a sliding bearing of the type mentioned at the<br>
start in that in the sliding bearing layer the tin<br>
crystals are predominantly globular-shaped.<br>
The object is also achieved according to the invention<br>
by a process of the type mentioned at the start charac-<br>
terized by the use of an electrolyte based on<br>
fluoroboric acid and metal fluoroborates in aqueous<br>
solution, which has the following ingredients:<br><br>
and also possible auxiliaries which do not pass into<br>
the sliding bearing layer to be produced, where, using<br>
at least one auxiliary on the basis of its molecular<br>
size, the migration rate of the ions of the elements<br>
forming the sliding layer is controlled such that<br>
predominantly globular-shaped tin crystals are formed.<br>
It has been found that by producing the sliding layer<br>
in a manner such that the majority of the tin crystals<br>
(&gt; 50%) have a globular structure - and not a needle-<br>
shaped or columnar structure as hitherto - an extra-<br>
ordinarily uniform structure of the sliding layer is<br>
achieved. The globular structure of the tin crystals<br>
can be achieved by controlling the deposition rate by<br>
adding large-molecular auxiliaries, such as, in parti-<br>
cular, gelatine and/or resorcinol, as a result of which<br>
the composition of the sliding layer and the structure<br>
which forms is adjusted in the desired manner. In this<br>
connection, the use of wetting agents which are formed<br><br>
by a C13C15-OXO alcohol, a C16C18-fatty alcohol or a C18-<br>
oxo alcohol with a degree of ethoxylation between 10<br>
and 30 is expedient. A preferred wetting agent is an<br>
oxo alcohol with a degree of ethoxylation of 20.<br>
The structure formed according to the invention has an<br>
extraordinarily uniform structure in which uniform and<br>
likewise essentially globular antimony-rich deposits<br>
arise in uniform distribution. Consequently, a signi-<br>
ficantly more stable sliding layer is achieved which<br>
can also be used in large thicknesses of clearly 20 µm,<br>
in particular above 50 µm, in a manner which is stable,<br>
homogeneous and free from delaminations. Thus, sliding<br>
layers with a thickness of, for example, 500 µm can be<br>
constructed directly.<br>
In connection with structures and crystallization,<br>
"globular" particles are to be understood as meaning<br>
those whose particle size has a ratio of the largest<br>
dimension to the smallest dimension of 

Suitable wetting agents are sold in particular under<br>
the brand Lutensol by BASF.<br>
Of particular suitability are the wetting agents (EO =<br>
degree of ethoxylation):<br>
Lutensol	AO 11	C13C15-oxo alcohol with 11 EO<br>
Lutensol	AO 30	C13C15-OXO alcohol with 30 EO<br>
Lutensol	AT 13	C16C18-fatty alcohol with 13 EO<br>
Lutensol	AT 25	C16C18-fatty alcohol with 25 EO<br>
Lutensol	TO 12	C13-oxo alcohol with 12 EO<br>
Lutensol	TO 20	C13-oxo alcohol with 20 EO<br>
Lutensol	ON 110	C13-oxo alcohol with 20 EO.<br>
The wetting agents Lutensol ON 110 and TO 20 have<br>
proven to be particularly suitable for producing the<br>
sliding bearing layer according to the invention and<br><br>
avoiding dendrite formation. Lutensol ON 110, i.e. a<br>
C13-OXO alcohol with 20 EO is particularly preferred.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the sliding element<br>
according to the invention, the copper fraction in the<br>
sliding layer is between 3 and 6%. Contrary to the<br>
teaching of the utility model 82 06 353 U1, the<br>
increased copper fraction leads to an increase in the<br>
load-bearing capacity and in the fatigue strength of<br>
the sliding layer. According to the invention, there-<br>
fore, a copper fraction can be provided which is not<br>
only above the advantageously desired copper content of<br>
generally considered in the cited specification of at<br>
most 2%.<br>
The preferred antimony fraction in the sliding layer is<br>
between 8 and 17% by weight.<br>
The preferred copper fraction is between 2 and 7%.<br>
The fraction of the globular-shaped tin crystals in the<br>
sliding layer is preferably more than 70%, further<br>
preferably more than 80%.<br>
The sliding element according to the invention can be a<br>
customary cylindrical sliding bearing sleeve, a section<br>
of such a sliding bearing sleeve or else an essentially<br>
flat element. The formative support element consists of<br>
metal and can conventionally consist of steel with a<br>
plated bearing metal which has emergency lubricating<br>
properties. The sliding layer according to the<br>
invention is applied to this support element. Since the<br>
sliding layer according to the invention with a large<br>
layer thickness can be applied with a high stability,<br>
it is also possible to omit the bearing metal layer and<br>
to directly apply the sliding layer to a formative<br>
support element made of metal.<br><br>
According to the invention, the experimental results<br>
below for working examples are illustrated:<br>
A base electrolyte (without wetting agent) with the<br>
following composition was prepared:<br><br>
The resorcinol and the gelatine are auxiliaries which<br>
influence the composition and the deposition rate of<br>
the layer which is formed. Resorcinol essentially<br>
influences the composition while the large molecules of<br>
gelatine influence the crystal structure, the roughness<br>
and the layer composition. For this purpose, the<br>
gelatine concentration can expediently be adjusted to<br>
between 0.1 and 0.5 g/1.<br>
The electrolytic deposition was carried out using a<br>
constant current of 2 A/dm2 using tin electrodes at a<br>
bath temperature of from 22 to 24°C.<br>
The steel substrate has been precoated (electrolyti-<br>
cally) with a nickel layer.<br>
The SnSbCu depositions were performed either on<br>
rotating rod electrodes or on sheet metal strips. The<br>
deposition on rotating rod electrodes avoids<br>
uncontrolled dendrite growth which would have adversely<br>
affected the experimental results.<br>
Compared with a reference standard wetting agent as has<br>
hitherto customarily been used, all of the investigated<br>
wetting agents lead to a different structure during<br>
deposition. In particular, the dendrite growth is<br><br>
considerably reduced.<br>
In this regard, the use of the wetting agents Lutensol<br>
ON 110 and Lutensol TO 20 is particularly advantageous.<br>
Using the mentioned wetting agents, in particular using<br>
the preferably used wetting agents, a sliding layer is<br>
thus realized which differs from the sliding layers to<br>
date as regards its crystalline structure and offers<br>
considerable handling advantages. In particular, the<br>
layer can be constructed with virtually any desired<br>
thicknesses, thereby achieving freedom, which is<br>
hitherto not being present, with regard to the layer<br>
thicknesses and the construction of the sliding<br>
elements.<br><br>
