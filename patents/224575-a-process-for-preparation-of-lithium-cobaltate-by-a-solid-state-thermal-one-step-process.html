				<td>SOLID STATE THERMAL SYNTHESIS OF LITHIUM COBALTATE<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a novel solid state thermal process for the preparation of lithium cobaltate (LiCoOa) useful as a cathode material in nonaqueous, solid state and polymer electrolyte for secondary rock in chair or intercalated batteries. Background of the invention<br>
Lithium cobaltate (LiCo02) is widely used as a cathode in lithium secondary cells in the view of its high reversibility to lithium ions and less fading capacity over LiNiO2 and LiMn2O4 electrodes. Methods reported in the art for the preparation of cathode lithium cobaltate (LiCoO2) disclose the reaction of lithium nitrate, or lithium hydroxide, lithium acetate or any other lithium salts with cobalt nitrates, oxides, acetates, hydroxides, sulphates by soft chemistry method like sol-gel process between temperature ranges of 350-500°C for long duration of time and multistep preparation procedures. Normally, in solid state thermal methods in the synthesis of these oxide materials, the duration of preparation is long heating, intermittent cooling and grinding process. Other preparation methods are also available in literature for synthesizing lithium cobaltate like pulsed laser deposition, sputtering and electrostatic spray deposition. References:<br>

Objects of the invention<br>
The main object of this present invention is to provide a novel method for the preparation of Lithium cobaltate (LiCo02) hitherto unattempted which obviates the drawbacks mentioned above.<br>
It is another object of the invention are achieved by the novel process of the invneiton comprising solid state thermal one step reaction of lithium oxide and cobalt nitrate.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of lithium cobaltate by a solid state thermal one step process comprising mixing lithium oxide (L12O) and cobalt nitrate<br><br>
 (Co(N03)2) in a ratio of 1:2 in solid state uniformly, adding a heat generating material to the mixture and grinding the mixture, heating the ground mixture at a temperature in the range of 650 to 700°C to obtain the desired lithium cobaltate.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the ratio of the Li20 + Co(N03)2 mixture and the heat generating material<br>
is 1:3.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention the ground mixture is heated in a furnace for about 8 hours.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the Li20 is mixed with Co(N03)2 in the following ratios.<br>
Li20:Ni(N03)2=l:2 In another embodiment of the invention, the heat generating material is selected from urea and ammonium nitrate.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention electric furnace is used for heating.<br>
In still another embodiment of the invention, the materials used are all in solid state.<br>
Brief description of the accompanying drawings<br>
Figure 1 is an X-ray diffraction pattern of lithium cobaltate obtained by the process of the invneiotn. Detailed description of the invention<br>
The present invention involves a solid state thermal one step process for the preparation of lithium cobaltate comprising mixing lithium oxide (Li20) and cobalt nitrate (Co(N03)2 in the following preferred ratio:<br>
Li20 : Ni(N03)2 = 1:2<br>
Heating is carried out preferably in an electric furnace with all materials used being in the solid state.<br>
The following reaction occurs during the thermal process.<br>
Li20 +  2Co(N03)2 + 3(0) -&gt; 2LiCo02 + 4N02 + 202<br>
The reaction as can be seen proceeds in a single step and the product was confirmed as lithium cobaltate by X-<br>
ray diffraction.<br>
Li20 solid sate material is allowed to react with solid Co(N03)2 under controlled conditions at moderate temperatures which yields fairly very good sample of spinal structure useful as    a    very    good    intercalating   cathode. Pure   AR   sample of   Co(N03)2    is mixed   with     pure<br><br>
AR sample of Li2O in the molecular ratio of 2:1 such that a uniform mixture is formed with 3 times weight percentage of urea. In order to obtain a better homogeneous mixture, this mixture is ground well with double distilled water free DiEthylene Carbonate (DEC). This mixture is heated to 300°C and then further heated to 700°C for 5 hours continuously to yield lithium cobaltate (LiCoOa) which is evidenced by X-ray analysis (Figure la).<br>
The reaction can also be carried out by replacing urea with ammonium nitrate. LiaO solid state material is allowed to react with solid Co(NO3)2 under controlled conditions at moderate temperatures which yields fairly very good sample of spinel structure useful as a very good intercalating cathode. Pure AR sample of Co(NOs)2is mixed with pure AR sample of Li20 in the molecular ratio of 2:1 such that a uniform mixture is formed with 3 times weight percentage of ammonium nitrate. In order to obtain a better homogeneous mixture, this mixture is ground well with double distilled water free Di ethylene carbonate (DEC). This mixture was heated to 300°C and then heated to 700°C for 5 hours continuously to yield lithium cobaltate (LiCoCh) as is evidenced by X-ray analysis (Figure Ib).<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration and therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention. Example 1 Preparation ofLiCoOj:<br>
Li2O solid state material is allowed to react with solid Co(NOs)2 under controlled conditions at moderate temperatures which yields fairly very good sample of spinel structure useful as a very good intercalating cathode. Pure AR sample of Co(NC&gt;3)2 is mixed with pure AR sample of Li2O in the molecular ratio of 2:1 such that a uniform mixture is formed with 3 times weight percentage of urea. In order to obtain a better homogeneous mixture, this mixture is ground well with double distilled water free Di Ethylene Carbonate (DEC). This mixture was heated to 300°C for 3 hours and then heated to 700°C for 5 hours continuously to yield lithium cobaltate (LiCoCh) which is evidenced by X-ray analysis (Figure la). Example 2 Preparation ofLiCoOz:<br>
LiaO solid state material is allowed to react with solid Co(N03)a under controlled conditions at moderate temperatures which yields fairly very good sample of spinel structure useful as a very good intercalating cathode. Pure AR sample of Co(NO3)2 is mixed with pure AR sample of Li2O in the molecular ratio of 2:1 such that a uniform mixture is formed with 3 times weight percentage of ammonium nitrate. In order to obtain a better homogeneous mixture, this mixture is ground well with double distilled water free Di ethylene carbonate<br>
(DEC). This mixture was heated to 300°C and then heated to 700°C for 5 hours continuously yields lithium cobaltate (LiCo02) formed which is evidenced by X-ray analysis (Figure Ib). Example 3<br>
AR pure dry Li2O is mixed with pure dry AR Co(N03)2 in the molar ratio of 1:2 in a pestle and mortar arrangement and then the mix is further mixed with 3 times the weight of urea and then introduced in an electric furnace. This mixture was heated first for 3 hours at 300°C and then heated at 700°C for 5 hours.<br><br>
