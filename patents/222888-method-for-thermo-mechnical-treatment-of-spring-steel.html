				<td>Method for Thermo Mechanical Treatment of Steel<br>
Description<br>
The invention pertains to a method for producing helical springs or stabilisers of steel<br>
according to the introductory part of claim 1.<br>
The document DE 43 40 568 C2 gives a method for continuous annealing of steel wire,<br>
which contains the following steps:<br>
Quick heating of the wire to a temperature in the austenitic range with a velocity<br>
between 85 and 100°C/sec;<br>
Holding the steel wire in the austenitic range for a period 10 to 60 secs.;<br>
Quenching of the steel wire up to the room temperature with a velocity<br>
&gt;80°C/sec;<br>
- Quick heating to tempering temperature with a velocity of 85 to 95°C/sec;<br>
Holding at the tempering temperature for a period of 60 to 100 sec;<br>
Cooling the wire with the usual the velocity of &gt;50°C/sec, generally used for<br>
water cooling.<br>
Between step 2 and 3 the wire can be tightly rolled above the Ac3 temperature. The wire<br>
is first subjected to an oval pass, then round-rolled in a second pass and subsequently<br>
drawn through a calibrating nozzle.<br>
The document DE 195 46 204 C1 describes a method for producing high-strength objects<br>
from heat-treatable steel and application of this method for producing springs. The steel<br>
with (in mass-%) 0.4 to 0.6% C, up to 1% Si, up to 1.8% Mn, 0.8 to 1.5% Cr, 0.03 to<br>
0.1% Np, 0 to 0.2% V, and the rest iron, should be treated as follows:<br>
The preliminary material is subjected to solution treatment in the austenitic range<br>
at temperatures of 1050 to 1200°C;<br>
Immediately thereafter the starting material is heat-deformed in a first step at a<br>
temperature above the re-crystallization temperature;<br>
Immediately thereafter the starting material is heat-deformed in a second step at a<br>
temperature below the re-crystallization temperature, however above the Ac3<br>
temperature;<br>
- The rolled product is then kept at a temperature above the Ac3 temperature for<br>
carrying out further deformation and treatment processes; and thereafter<br>
Cooled to below the martensite temperature, and<br>
Then tempered.<br>
The document DE 196 37 968 C2 gives a method for high-temperature-thermo-<br>
mechanical production of spring plates for plate springs and/or plate spring deflectors,<br>
which is based on a two step thermo mechanical parabolic spring production. The<br>
method is based on the following steps:<br>
The parent material is heated to austenitisation temperature with a heating<br>
velocity between 4°C/sec. and 30°C/sec;<br>
- The austenitisation temperature lies at 1100 ? 100°C,<br>
- The material is cooled from the austenitisation temperature to the temperature of<br>
the first rolling stage with a cooling velocity between 10°C/sec. and 30°C/sec.<br>
First, in a first rolling stage, preliminary rolling is done in one or more passes at a<br>
temperature of 1050?100°C with a shape change between 15% and 18% which is<br>
not constant over the length of the spring plate;<br>
- Cooling is then done from the temperature of the first rolling stage to the<br>
temperature of the second rolling stage with a cooling velocity between 10°C/sec.<br>
and 30°C/sec.<br>
In the second rolling stage, finish-rolling is done at a temperature of 880 ? 30°C<br>
with a shape change between 15% and 45% which is constant over the length of<br>
the spring length, in one or more passes, with rollers which can be adjusted under<br>
load.<br>
Finally, the document DE 198 39 383 C2 publishes a method for thermo-mechanical<br>
treatment of steel for spring elements subjected to torsion, whereby the parent material is<br>
deformed to a temperature above the re-crystallization temperature and subsequently at<br>
such a temperature above the re-crystallization temperature, in at least two deformation<br>
stages, in such a way that one obtains a dynamic and/or static crystallization of the<br>
austenite. The thus re-crystallised austenite of the deformed product is quenched and<br>
tempered. One should use a silicon-chromium-steel with a carbon content of 0.25 to<br>
0.75%, which is micro-alloyed with vanadium or some other alloy element.<br>
The methods existing in the state-of-the-art technology for thermo-mechanical treatment<br>
of objects consisting of steel are mainly based on multi-stage deforming steps, whereby<br>
multiple cooling/heating of the parent material is necessary in order to later create<br>
parameters which can be adjusted in the end product.<br>
It is the task of this invention to present a method for producing helical springs or<br>
stabilisers of steel according to the introductory part of claim 1, which allows a specific<br>
improvement in the characteristic parameters directed at the loading profile of the end<br>
product.<br>
This task is fulfilled by means of a method having the features mentioned in patent claim<br>
1.<br>
Advantageous extensions of the method are described in claims 2 to 24.<br>
According to the method as per the invention, the parent material is first heated up to a<br>
temperature above the re-crystallization temperature and subsequently a temperature<br>
compensation takes place over the entire bar length. In addition to that, the heating<br>
temperature of the bar is kept constant almost up to the point of running into the roller<br>
gap. With these working steps one endeavours to achieve a homogeneous texture<br>
structure of the bar as far as possible, over its length as well as over its cross-section<br>
before entry into the roller gap; this is advantageous for the subsequent deformation<br>
process. On account of the process-specific characteristics of diagonal rolling and by<br>
specifically laying down the rolling parameters, a pre-defined torsion of the material sets<br>
in in the edge of the bars and a deformation gradient sets in over the bar cross-section.<br>
As during diagonal rolling the deformation direction runs inclined to the axis of the rolled<br>
stock and the maximum of deformation lies in the edge region of the bars, the<br>
deformation-caused texture extension in this zone is particularly strongly pronounced and<br>
the structure alignment runs corresponding to the deformation direction, also similarly<br>
inclined to the axis of the rolled stock. After exceeding the critical deformation degree<br>
the dynamic re-crystallization process gets intensively reduced in this edge zone, so that<br>
one can identify a slope of the re-crystallization degree over the bar cross-section from<br>
outside to inside. Following the deformation process, during post-heating above Ac3 the<br>
static re-crystallization is completed, which leads to the formation of fine-grained<br>
austenite, particularly in the edge zone. After hardening and subsequent tempering, the<br>
edge zone is marked by fine martensite-structures of high stability.<br>
The invention presents significant advantages as compared to the known solutions in the<br>
state-of-the-art technology. In the result of the combination of a specific, single-step<br>
deformation with the help of diagonal rolling and a heat treatment attuned to it, the<br>
treated bars reveal a stability profile over their cross-section which reaches its maximum<br>
values in the edge regions. The torsion direction of the structure in the edge region of the<br>
round bars caused by the diagonal rolling corresponds to the main tension direction of a<br>
component subjected to torsion, and the characteristic feature of the bars resulting from it<br>
thus reveal optimum pre-requisites for their application, especially in the spring industry.<br>
The structure distribution over the bar cross-section caused by the method as per the<br>
invention leads in the completely treated round bars to a characteristic profile which is<br>
adequate for the tension profile over the bar cross-section for bending and torsion load.<br>
As only one deformation step is required for forming these advantageous stability effects,<br>
and the subsequent treatment steps are mainly carried out under heat, consequently only<br>
one heating up process is required for the parent material, which as a result of this<br>
method leads to significant savings in energy and time. Therefore, as compared to the<br>
known method, the method as per the invention not only ensures an improvement of the<br>
loading-oriented stability and toughness properties of the final product, but beyond that<br>
also ensures economic advantages on account of the minimum number of process steps.<br>
The parent material in the form of round bars is inductively heated up at a heating<br>
velocity of 100 to 200 K/sec. to a temperature between 700 and 1100°C. Subsequently a<br>
compensation of the heating temperature of the bar takes place over its length for a period<br>
of at least 10 sec. In this way it is ensured that a temperature difference over the bar<br>
length does not exceed 5 K. With the help of a suitable post-heating unit the heated up<br>
temperature of the bar is kept constant till it runs into the roller gap. The re-modelling<br>
itself takes place by means of diagonal rolling in a step, in which the bars run through the<br>
roller gap while remaining straight. Depending on the material of the parent material, the<br>
re-modelling preferably takes place in a temperature range of 700 - 1150°C. The<br>
diameter ratio initial diameter/final diameter is selected in such a way that the diagonal<br>
rolling of the bars take place with an average stretching degree ? of greater than 1.3 and<br>
the maximum re-formation is at least ? = 0.3. By specific adjustment of the rolling<br>
parameters, like e.g. rolling rotation speed and feed velocity, and by means of the special<br>
selection of roller contours with specific angular relationship, it can be achieved that the<br>
maximum deformation lies in the edge region between 0.65 and 1.0 of the diameter of the<br>
bars and that the desired deformation gradient sets in over the bar cross-section. The<br>
diagonal rolling process is preferably controlled in such a way that, in the rolled stock a<br>
maximum local temperature increase of 50K is not exceeded.<br>
On account of the deformation, after exceeding a critical deformation degree, dynamic re-<br>
crystallization processes take place, which are more strongly pronounced in the edge<br>
zone on account of maximum deformation than in the core region of the bars. The<br>
specifically targeted influence of the formation of a deformation gradient over the bar<br>
cross-section brings in the effect, that already in the core of the dynamic re-<br>
crystallization, the first signs of a differentiated structure distribution over the rolled<br>
stock cross-section stets in. Thus in metallographic investigations in bars rolled as per<br>
the invention, one can find in the re-crystallized condition, a significant reduction in the<br>
share of austenite crystals from the edge zone in the direction of the core region.<br>
The differentiated structure formation over the rolled stock cross-section is also<br>
additionally strengthened by a typical property of diagonal rolling. As during diagonal<br>
rolling the deformation direction runs inclined to the rolled stock axis, one particularly<br>
obtains in the edge region of the rolled stock a conspicuous structure-stretching on<br>
account of higher deformation. Corresponding to the deformation direction the structure<br>
also runs inclined to the axis of the rolled stock and leads to torsion of the material in the<br>
edge region. In the process sequence as per the invention, the torsion direction of the<br>
structure in the edge direction of the bars is 35 to 65 degrees with respect to the<br>
longitudinal axis of the bar and thus corresponds to the main tension direction of a<br>
component subjected to torsion.<br>
In the shown method of single-step diagonal rolling, the bar to be rolled runs through<br>
with its entire length through a roller gap with constant roller gap geometry. This method<br>
is selected when bars with uniform diameter over the bar length are supposed to be<br>
produced. The method as per the invention further allows an alternative process variant,<br>
in which the roller gap geometry in the operating condition is changed during the passage<br>
of the bar to be rolled through the roll gap. This flexible working method is realized with<br>
the help of a diagonal rolling set-up, whose rollers, if required, can be displaced during<br>
deformation in axial and/or radial direction. In this way the method as per the invention<br>
allows production of round bars with variable diameter over the bar length. Immediately<br>
after coming out of the rolling set-up the diagonally rolled bars are subjected to post-<br>
heating at a temperature of above Ac3. The post-heating is done in such a way that the<br>
temperature difference over the length of a bar is limited to 5K.<br>
Depending on the later purpose of application, the diagonally rolled bars post-heated to<br>
re-crystallization temperatures are either wound into a helical spring under heat or bent to<br>
form a stabiliser. The wound or bent components are subsequently hardened and then<br>
tempered.<br>
Bars which are foreseen for production of torsion-bar springs, after post-heating are<br>
mechanically treated at their ends in cold condition, subsequently heated above Ac3,<br>
quenched and tempered.<br>
Macro-investigations on the finished process bars reveal a typical structure distribution<br>
over the bar cross-section as a result of the combination as per the invention of diagonal<br>
rolling and heat treatment. The immediate edge zone reveals fine-grained a martensite<br>
structure of high stability. The edge region reveals a continuous structure-stretching<br>
inclined to the bar axis, whose torsion direction corresponds to the main torsion direction<br>
of a component subjected to torsion. The pearlitic-martensitic mixed structure of the core<br>
zone is coarser-grained than the structure in the edge region and does not reveal any<br>
torsion occurrences.<br>
For setting optimum toughness and stability parameters in the finished product, the parent<br>
material used for the method as per the invention is round bars made of spring steel,<br>
preferably silicon- chromium-steels with carbon content 
steels could be micro-alloyed with vanadium or Niob.<br>
The object of the invention is depicted in the drawing on the basis of a design example<br>
and is described below.<br>
The only figure shows the principle structure of a line production for thermo mechanical<br>
treatment of round steel bars made of a silicon-chromium-steel as per the invention.<br>
The bars to be treated are heated up in an induction system to a temperature above the re-<br>
crystallization temperature, whereby their structure is austenitised . In the present<br>
example the round steel bars are heated up at a heating velocity of 130K/sec. to a<br>
temperature of 980°C. In the compensation furnace 2 connected to the induction system<br>
1, a compensation of the heated temperature of the bars takes place over a period of 15<br>
sec, so that the temperature graph over the length of the bars reveals a gradient of 4K.<br>
In this condition, the now uniformly tempered round steel bars are introduced into a<br>
holding furnace 3 in order to retain their temperature constant till they enter into the roll<br>
gap. The heated up bars are transported into the compensated furnace 2 and also in the<br>
holding furnace 3 by means of roll tables 6 or 7.<br>
In a diagonal rolling system 4 the round steel bars heated up to a temperature of 980°C<br>
are deformed in the rolling stage. In doing so, the diameter ratio initial diameter/final<br>
diameter is selected in such a way that one can work with an average stretching degree A.<br>
= 1.5 and that the maximum deformation amounts to at least ? = 0.3. With the help of<br>
the specifically targeted setting of rolling parameters, like e.g. the rolling rotation speed<br>
or the feed velocity, and by means of special selection of roller contours with specific<br>
angular relationship, the maximum deformation is achieved in the edge region between<br>
0.65 and 1.0 of the diameter of the bars and thus the desired deformation gradients sets in<br>
over the bar cross-section. The rolling parameters are attuned one another in such a way<br>
that a maximum local temperature increase of 50K is not exceeded in the rolled stock on<br>
account of the deformation process. The deformation direction running inclined to the<br>
rolling axis during diagonal rolling effects a pronounced structure-stretching in the edge<br>
regions of the rolled stock on account of higher deformation. Corresponding to the<br>
deformation direction, this structure-stretching similarly runs inclined to the axis to the<br>
rolled stock and leads to a torsion of the material in the edge region of the bars. In the<br>
process sequence of the method as per the invention, the torsion direction of the structure,<br>
with respect to the longitudinal axis of the bars, amounts to 35 to 65° and thus<br>
corresponds to the main tension direction of a component subjected to torsion.<br>
After coming out of the diagonal rolling system 4, the rolled bars enter into the post-<br>
heating furnace 5 connected to the system, in which they are subjected to post-heating<br>
above the Ac3 temperature in order to ensure a complete static re-crystallization.<br>
Transportation of the bars through the post-heating furnace 5 takes place with the help of<br>
a roll table 8. After leaving the post-heating furnace 5, the diagonally rolled bars are<br>
further transported with the help of a handover roll table 9. From this handover roll table<br>
9 the bars are fed to the further foreseen processing steps.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a production line for producing wound helical springs. Thereafter the bars<br>
are handed over by the handover roll table 9 to a lift table 10 and from there reach into<br>
the CNC-winding bench 11, where the winding into the helical springs takes place under<br>
heat after re-crystallization. After the winding sequence, the bars now wound into helical<br>
springs, are transferred to a hardening basin 12, in which they are quenched and their<br>
structure is transformed to martensite. Subsequently the hardened helical springs are<br>
subjected to a tempering treatment which is not shown.<br>

diagonal-rolled bar, approx, straight bar, is bent into a stabiliser.<br>
23. Method as claimed in claims 21 or 20, wherein the diagonal rolled bar as<br>
torsion bar remains almost straight and its ends are treated.<br>
Dated this 22nd day of August 2005<br>
A method for thermo mechanical treatment of spring steel comprising the<br>
heating up of spring steel bars in an induction system (1) to a temperature<br>
between 900°C-1100°C at the rate of temperature rise 130K/sec. The steel bars<br>
are passed to a compensation furnace 2, by means of roller table (6), a<br>
compensation of the heated temperature of the bars takes place over a period of<br>
15 sec to achieve a temperature gradient over the length is 4K. The steel bars<br>
are passed to a holding furnace (3) by means of roller table (7) to achieve a<br>
constant temperature. The round steel bars are deformed in a diagonal rolling<br>
system (4). After coming out of the diagonal rolling system (4), the rolled bars<br>
enter into a post-heating furnace (5) in which they are subjected to post-heating<br>
(900-1100°C) to ensure complete static re-crystallization. The diagonally rolled<br>
bars are transported by means of a roll table (8) from furnace (5) again<br>
transported with the help of a hand over roll table (9). The bars are handed<br>
over by hand over roll table (9) to a lift table (10) and from there reach into the<br>
CNC-winding bench (11) where the winding into the helical springs take place.<br>
The helical springs are transported to a hardening basin (12) wherein they are<br>
quenched. There after the hardened helical springs are subjected to a tempering<br>
treatment.</td>
