Field of the invention<br>
The invention relates to a chewing gum according to the provisions of claim 1.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Non-tack properties have been desired for decades in relation to chewing gum and<br>
have been pursued by several technical approaches.<br>
One approach has been to apply different variants of poly vinyl acetate (PVA)-based<br>
gum base compositions.<br>
Another approach has been to apply different types of biodegradable polymers in<br>
different chewing gum compositions.<br>
The latter approach has among several other technical paths been solved by use of<br>
polyesters obtained through polymerization of cyclic esters.<br>
One problem in relation to the use of such polymers is, however, that such polyesters<br>
may often have undesired properties in connection with chewing gum.<br>
Thus, e.g. the homopolymer of L-lactide (LPLA) is a semicrystalline polymer. These<br>
types of material exhibit high-tensile strength and low elongation, and consequently<br>
have a high modulus that makes them more suitable for load-bearing applications in<br>
other applications than chewing gum.<br>
In order to improve the desired properties of the polymers, extensive research has<br>
been performed by the provision of different copolymers of L-lactide and D,L-<br>
lactide. Specifically, attempts have been made to disrupt the crystallinity of L-lactide<br>
by the use of other monomers in the polymer chains, such as e-caprolactone.<br><br>
Such research has resulted in more amorphous polymers applicable for chewing gum<br>
application.<br>
Other attempts following the same path have been to apply significant amounts of<br>
softeners in order to change the property of the individual polymers.<br>
A problem relating to the above approaches is, however, that improved amorphous<br>
properties of the individual polymers obviously may invoke modifications of other<br>
structural features of the polymer in the direction of the typical conventional<br>
polymers with respect to the desired amorphous as well as the more undesired<br>
tackiness properties. This may result in an undesired tackiness when a user is<br>
chewing the chewing gum. Moreover, when the chewing gum is disposed in the<br>
environment it tends to tack to surfaces in the same way as conventional chewing<br>
gum.<br>
It is the object of the invention to provide a chewing gum which benefits of<br>
acceptable chew feel as well as improved non-tackiness.<br>
Summary<br>
The invention relates to a non-tack chewing gum comprising chewing gum<br>
ingredients,<br>
said chewing gum comprising at least one elastomer and at least one resin,<br>
said at least one resin comprising at least one synthetic homopolymer resin,<br>
said synthetic homopolymer being biodegradable,<br><br>
the amount of said synthetic biodegradable homopolymer of said chewing gum being<br>
from about Vz% to 60% by weight of said chewing gum.<br>
Improved non-tack properties of a chewing gum have been obtained by the<br>
application of a synthetic homopolymer according to the provisions of the invention<br>
combined with acceptable chew feel during use.<br>
The obtained non-tack properties combined with acceptable chew feel is according to<br>
an embodiment of the invention obtained by a combination of a biodegradable<br>
homopolymer and an elastomer in the chewing gum.<br>
The brittleness of the homopolymer may thus, during chewing, be compensated by<br>
the elastomer and the tackiness may be counteracted, especially after disposal, when<br>
the homopolymer induces brittleness into the chewing gum lump.<br>
Such inducing of brittleness has been observed to influence the brittleness of the<br>
complete chewing gum and counteract floating.<br>
Specifically, it has been observed that improved non-tack properties may be obtained<br>
in environments where the temperature is below or well below the glass transition<br>
temperature of the homopolymer.<br>
According to the invention, biodegradable homopolymer resin designates that the<br>
homopolymer has resinous properties and has the function of a resin in the chewing<br>
gum.<br>
The chewing gum according to the provisions of the invention may be regarded as<br>
having improved non-tack properties. <br><br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the amount of said synthetic homopolymer of<br>
said chewing gum is from about 2% to 50% by weight of said chewing gum,<br>
preferably from about 2% to 30% by weight of said chewing gum.<br>
Experiments have shown that a synthetic biodegradable homopolymer present in a<br>
significant amount leads to further improved non-tack properties compared to<br>
different co-polymers.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said synthetic homopolymer is resinous.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the homopolymer forms a<br>
resinous part of a resin and elastomer mixture forming at least a part of the gum base<br>
of the chewing gum.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the synthetic homopolymer comprises a polyester<br>
polymer.<br>
According to an embodiment of the invention, a biodegradable polyester<br>
homopolymer may advantageously be applied as the resin or as the main resinous<br>
component of the chewing gum, thereby obtaining improved non-tack properties.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said biodegradable polyester polymer is<br>
obtainable by ring-opening polymerization of cyclic monomers.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said biodegradable polyester polymer is<br>
obtainable by ring-opening polymerization of cyclic monomers selected from the<br>

obtained by the application of a homopolymer having relative high glass transition<br>
temperature(s), as a relative high glass transition temperature may be applicable<br>
when applying the homopolymer as resinous component of a chewing gum and<br>
moreover increase an advantageous change of structural properties when disposed in<br>
the environment at moderate temperatures.<br>

an average molecular weight of about 30000 g/mol to 1000000 g/mol Mn is within<br>
the range of about 1:5 and 20:1.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the ratio between the resin<br>
and the elastomer should be kept within a certain range in order to obtain the desired<br>
texture. The average molecular weight of the resin and the elastomer, respectively,<br>
may e.g. be obtained through a mixture of two or further resins and a mixture of two<br>
or further elastomers. Thus, an average molecular weight of a certain value of e.g.<br>
the elastomer may be obtained by mixing a high and low molecular weight elastomer<br>
in an appropriate ratio. Specifically, a mixture of about 2/3 low molecular elastomer<br>
(30000 g/mol) and 1/3 "high molecular weight elastomer (400000) would result in an<br>
average molecular weight of about 153000.<br><br>

synthetic flavorings in the form of natural vegetable components, essential oils,<br>
essences, extracts, powders, including acids and other substances capable of affecting<br>
the taste profile.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said chewing gum comprises flavor in an amount<br>
of 0.01 to about 25 wt %, preferably in an amount of 0.1 to about 5 wt %, said<br>
percentage being based on the total weight of the chewing gum.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the chewing gum is prepared with about 2-15%<br>
by weight of a syrup blend; wherein the syrup blend includes about 25-45% glycerin,<br>
about 55-75% hydrogenated starch hydrolysates.<br>
According to an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the chewing gum<br>
comprises a non-tack chewing gum in which the ingredients exhibit excellent<br>
cohesive strength between each other without causing the gum to stick to external<br>
surfaces such as teeth and dentures. The chewing gum, according to the embodiment,<br><br>
does typically not exhibit short texture and does not easily break, rupture or separate<br>
during processing and handling. The chewing gum also has good sensory qualities.<br>
An essential ingredient in the non-tack sugarless chewing gum of the present<br>
embodiment is a coevaporated blend including glycerine and hydrogenated starch<br>
hydrolysates. This syrup blend is prepared by mixing glycerine with a commercially<br>
available mixture of water and hydrogenated starch hydrolysates to form a three-<br>
component blend, and then evaporating most of the water from the blend. This<br>
coevaporated blend is in the form of syrup prior to addition into the chewing gum. It<br>
has been discovered that this syrup blend serves as an excellent binder between non-<br>
tack chewing gum ingredients, including the gum base ingredients, without causing<br>
adhesion to teeth or dentures. The syrup blend may be added after manufacture of the<br>
gum base, and during manufacture of the final chewing gum product. The syrup<br>
blend should constitute about 2 to about 15% by weight of the chewing gum.<br>
As explained above, the syrup blend is added during manufacture of the chewing<br>
gum. Except for the addition of the syrup blend, the underlying chewing gum<br>
composition may be any non-tack chewing gum which could stand to benefit from<br>
improved binding between its ingredients. Generally, such chewing gums would<br>
include any gum having a non-tack gum base which could stand to benefit from<br>
improved binding. Often, the cohesiveness of a conventional chewing gum product,<br>
or lack thereof, has been dependent upon the cohesiveness of the gum base used in<br>
the chewing gum, or lack thereof.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the syrup blend is present at about 2-15% by<br>
weight of the chewing gum.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the syrup blend is present at about 5-10% by<br>
weight of the chewing gum.<br><br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the syrup blend includes about 25-45% glycerin,<br>
about 55-75% hydrogenated starch hydrolysates.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the syrup blend comprises a coevaporated blend<br>
of glycerin mixed with hydrogenated starch hydrolysates and water.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the chewing gum comprises at least one softener<br>
in an amount of about 0 to about 20% by weight of the chewing gum, more typically<br>
about 0 to about 10% by weight of the chewing gum.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the amount of emulsifier is in the range of 0 to<br>
18% by weight of the chewing gum.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said sweetening agents are selected from the<br>
group comprising bulk sweeteners, and high-intensity sweeteners, and combinations<br>
thereof.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the chewing gum comprises sugar.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the chewing gum is sugar free.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said bulk sweeteners comprises an amount of<br>
about 5 to about 95%, preferably about 20 to about 80% by weight of the chewing<br>
gum.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the chewing gum comprises high-intensity<br>
sweeteners in an amount of about 0 to about 1.2%, preferably about 0.1 to about<br>
0.6% by weight of the chewing gum- <br><br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the chewing gum comprises filler in an amount<br>
of about 0 to about 50% by weight of the chewing gum, more typically about 5 to<br>
about 20% by weight of the chewing gum.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the chewing gum comprises at least one coloring<br>
agent.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said chewing gum ingredients comprise active<br>
ingredients.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said chewing gum is coated with an outer coating<br>
selected from the group comprising hard coating, soft coating and edible film-<br>
coating.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the outer coating comprises at least one additive<br>
component selected from the group comprising a binding agent, a moisture-<br>
absorbing component, a film-forming agent, a dispersing agent, an antisticking<br>
component, a bulking agent, a flavoring agent, a coloring agent, a pharmaceutically<br>
or cosmetically active component, a lipid component, a wax component, a sugar, an<br>
acid and an agent capable of accelerating the after-chewing degradation of the<br>
degradable polymers.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the chewing gum is wax free.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the chewing gum is made by tableting.<br>
According to an embodiment of the invention, the chewing gum may advantageously<br>
be processed and formed as a compressed chewing gum due to the fact that the<br>
homopolymer has advantageous non-tack properties, which may ease the granulation<br>
of the gum or gum base prior to the final compression.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
According to a preferred definition of biodegradability according to the invention,<br>
biodegradability is a property of certain organic molecules whereby, when exposed<br>
to the natural environment or placed within a living organism, they react through an<br>
enzymatic or microbial process, often in combination with a chemical process such<br>
as hydrolysis, to form simpler compounds, and ultimately carbon dioxide, nitrogen<br>
oxides, methane, water and the like.<br>
In the present context the term 'biodegradable polymers' means environmentally or<br>
biologically degradable polymer compounds and refers to chewing gum base<br>
components which, after dumping the chewing gum, are capable of undergoing a<br>
physical, chemical and/or biological degradation, whereby the dumped chewing gum<br>
waste becomes more readily removable from the site of dumping or is eventually<br>
disintegrated to lumps or particles, which are no longer recognizable as being<br>
chewing gum remnants. The degradation or disintegration of such degradable poly-<br>
mers may be effected or induced by physical factors such as temperature, light,<br>
moisture, etc., by chemical factors such as oxidative conditions, pH, hydrolysis, etc.<br>
or by biological factors such as microorganisms and/or enzymes. The degradation<br>
products may be larger oligomers, trimers, dimers and monomers.<br>
Preferably, the ultimate degradation products are small inorganic compounds such as<br>
carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, methane, ammonia, water, etc.<br>
As referred to herein, the glass transition temperature (Tg) may be determined by for<br>
example DSC (DSC: differential' scanning calorimetry). The DSC may generally be<br>
applied for determining and studying of the thermal transitions of a polymer and<br>
specifically, the technique may be applied for the determination of a second order<br>
transition of a material. The transition at Tg is regarded as such a second order<br>
transition, i.e. a thermal transition that involves a change in heat capacity, but does<br><br>
not have a latent heat. Hence, DSC may be applied for studying Tg. Unless otherwise<br>
indicated, a heating rate of 10°C/min will be applied.<br>
Unless otherwise indicated, as used herein with regard to polymers, the term<br>
"molecular weight" means number average molecular weight (Mn) in g/mol.<br>
Furthermore, as used herein the short form PD designates the polydispersity of<br>
polymers, polydispersity being defined as Mw /Mn, where Mw is the weight average<br>
molecular weight of a polymer. A well-established technique for characterization of<br>
biodegradable polymers is gel permeation chromatography (GPC).<br>
In the present text, it is assumed that the temperature in the mouth of the chewing<br>
gum consumer is about human body temperature, although it may in praxis during<br>
chewing be a few degrees below body temperature. A glass transition temperature<br>
above mouth temperature is herein referred to as a high Tg, whereas a Tg below<br>
mouth temperature is herein referred to as a low Tg.<br>
Chewing gum of the present invention typically comprises a water-soluble bulk<br>
-portion, a water-insoluble chewable gum base portion and flavoring agents. The<br>
water-soluble portion dissipates with a portion of the flavoring agent over a period of<br>
time during chewing. The gum base portion is retained in the mouth throughout the<br>
chew. The term chewing gum refers to both a chewing and bubble type gum in its<br>
general sense.<br>
The gum base is the masticatory substance of the chewing gum, which imparts the<br>
chew characteristics to the final product. The gum base typically defines the release<br>
profile of flavors and sweeteners and plays a significant role in the gum product.<br>
The insoluble portion of the gum typically may contain any combination of<br>
elastomers, vinyl polymers, elastomer plasticizers, waxes, softeners, fillers and other<br>
optional ingredients such as colorants and antioxidants. Polymeric elastomer<br><br>
plasticizers may also according to the invention generally be referred to as a resin or<br>
as a resinous compound.<br>
The composition of gum base formulations can vary substantially depending on the<br>
particular product to be prepared and on the desired masticatory and other sensory<br>
characteristics of the final product. However, typical ranges (% by weight) of the<br>
above gum base components are: 5 to 80% by weight elastomeric compounds, 5 to<br>
80% by weight elastomer plasticizers, 0 to 40% by weight of waxes, 5 to 35% by<br>
weight softener, 0 to 50% by weight filler, and 0 to 5% by weight of miscellaneous<br>
ingredients such as antioxidants, colorants, etc. The gum base may comprise about 5<br>
to about 95 percent, by weight, of the chewing gum, more commonly, the gum base<br>
comprises 10 to about 60 percent of the chewing gum.<br>
Elastomers provide the rubbery, cohesive nature to the gum, which varies depending<br>
on this ingredient's chemical structure and how it may be compounded with other<br>
ingredients. Elastomers suitable for use in the gum base and gum of the present<br>
invention may include natural or synthetic types.<br>
The elastomer may be any water-insoluble polymer known in the art, and includes<br>
those polymers utilized for chewing gum and bubble gum listed in Food and Drug<br>
Administration, CFR, Title 21, Section 172,615, as "Masticatory Substances of<br>
Natural Vegetable Origin" and "Masticatory Substances, Synthetic"<br>
Useful natural elastomers include natural rubber such as smoked or liquid latex and<br>
guayule, natural gums such as jelutorig, lechi caspi, perillo, sorva, massaranduba<br>
balata, massaranduba chocolate, nispero, rosidinha, chicle, gutta percha, gutta kataiu,<br>
niger gutta, tunu, chilte, chiquibul, gutta hang kang.<br>
Useful synthetic elastomers include high molecular weight elastomers such as<br>
butadiene-styrene copolymers, polyisoprene and isobutylene-isoprene copolymers,<br><br>
low-molecular weight elastomers such as polybutene, polybutadiene, polyisoprene<br>
and polyisobutylene, vinyl polymeric elastomers such as polyvinyl acetate,<br>
polyethylene, vinyl copolymeric elastomers such as vinyl acetate/vinyl laurate, vinyl<br>
acetate/vinyl stearate, ethylene/vinyl acetate, polyvinyl alcohol or mixtures thereof.<br>
Butadiene-styrene type elastomers (SBR) typically are copolymers of from about<br>
20:80 to 60:40 styrene:butadiene monomers. The ratio of these monomers affects the<br>
elasticity of the SBR as evaluated by mooney viscosity. As the styrene:butadiene<br>
ratio decreases, the mooney viscosity decreases.<br>
The structure of SBR typically consists of straight chain 1,3-butadiene	<br>
copolymerized with phenylethylene (styrene) and provides the non-linear molecular<br>
nature of these elastomers. The average molecular weight of SBR is 
g/mole.<br>
Isobutylene-isoprene type elastomers (butyl rubber) have molar percent levels of<br>
isoprene ranging from 0,2 to 4,0. Similar to SBR, as the isoprene:isobutylene ratio<br>
decreases, so does the elasticity, measured by mooney viscosity.<br>
The structure of butyl rubber typically consists of branched 2-methyl-l,3~butadiene<br>
(isoprene) copolymerized with branched 2-methylpropene (isobutylene), and, as with<br>
SBR, this type of structure is non-linear in nature. The average molecular weight of<br>
butyl rubber is in the range from 150,000 g/mole to 1,000,000 g/mole,<br>
Polyisobutylene (PIB) as with SBR and butyl, is also non-linear in nature. The low<br>
molecular weight elastomers provide soft chew characteristics to the polymer system<br>
and still provide the elastic qualities as do the other elastomers. Average molecular<br>
weights may range from about 30,000 to 120,000 g/mole and the penetration may<br>
range from about 4 millimeters to 20 millimeters. The higher the penetration, the<br>
softer the PIB. Similar to the SBR and butyl, the high molecular weight elastomers<br>
provide elasticity the gum. Average molecular weight may range from 120,000 to<br><br>
1,000,000 g/mole. Again, if used at all, the molecular weight should be relatively<br>
low.<br>
Vinyl copolymeric types of polymers may also be applied as a supplementary<br>
polymer of the gum base. For vinyl copolymeric types, the amount of vinyl laurate,<br>
vinyl stearate, or ethylene present in the vinyl laurate/vinyl acetate (VL/VA), vinyl<br>
stearate/vinyl acetate (VS/VA), or ethylene/vinyl acetate (EVA) copolymers<br>
respectively typically ranges from about 10 to about 60 percent by weight of the<br>
copolymer. Average molecular weights of these polymers may range from about<br>
2,000 g/mole to about 100,000 g/mole.<br>
The vinyl polymers as polyvinyl alcohol and polyvinyl acetate having an average<br>
molecular weight from about 5,000 g/mole to about 65,000 g/mole.<br>
The elastomer compounds may be of natural origin but are preferably of synthetic<br>
origin.<br>
Elastomer plasticizers vary the firmness of the gum base. Their specificity on<br>
elastomer inter-molecular chain breaking (plasticizing) along with their varying<br>
softening points cause varying degrees of finished gum firmness and compatibility<br>
when used in base. This may be important when one wants to provide more<br>
elastomeric chain exposure to the alkanic chains of the waxes.<br>
According to the present invention, the chewing gum comprises one plasticizer, also<br>
referred to as a resin, comprising one or several biodegradable homopolymers.<br>
Furthermore, according to the present invention, these biodegradable polymers are<br>
very suitable as resinous compounds in combination with one or further elastomers<br>
in the chewing gum.<br><br>
Further polymeric or non-polymeric plasticizers may be applied according to the<br>
present invention are triacetine, acetylated mono-and di-and triglycerides of short<br>
chain fatty acids, acetylated mono-and di-and triglycerides of medium chain fatty<br>
acids, acetylated monoglycerides of long chain fatty acids, glycerol ester of rosin and<br>
low molecular weight PVAc. The two latter may also be referred to as a natural and<br>
synthetic resin, respectively, within the art.<br>
The plasticizers used may be of one type or of combinations of more than one type.<br>
Typically, the ratios of one to the other are dependent on each respective softening<br>
point, the effect on flavor release, and the respective degree of tack they cause to the<br>
gum.<br>
Examples of such generally non-biodegradable synthetic resins include polyvinyl<br>
acetate, vinyl acetate-vinyl laurate copolymers and mixtures thereof. Examples of<br>
non-biodegradable synthetic elastomers include, but are not limited to, synthetic<br>
elastomers listed in Food and Drug Administration, CFR, Title 21, Section 172,615,<br>
(the Masticatory Substances, Synthetic) such as polyisobutylene. e.g. having a gel<br>
permeation chromatography (GPC) average molecular weight in the range of about<br>
10,000 to 1,000,000 including the range of 50,000 to 80,000, isobutylene-isoprene<br>
copolymer (butyl elastomer), styrene-butadiene copolymers e.g. having styrene-<br>
butadiene ratios of about 1:3 to 3:1, polyvinyl acetate (PVA), e.g. having a GPC<br>
average molecular weight in the range of 2,000 to 90,000 such as the range of 3,000<br>
to 80,000 including the range of 30,000 to 50,000, where the higher molecular<br>
weight polyvinyl acetates are typically used in bubble gum base, polyisoprene,<br>
polyethylene, vinyl acetate-vinyl laurate copolymer e.g. having a vinyl laurate<br>
content of about 5 to 50% by weight such as 10 to 45% by weight of the copolymer,<br>
and combinations hereof.<br>
Examples of natural resins are: Natural rosin esters, often referred to as ester gums<br>
including as examples glycerol esters of partially hydrogenated rosins, glycerol esters<br><br>
of polymerized rosins, glycerol esters of partially dimerized rosins, glycerol esters of<br>
tall oil rosins, pentaerythritol esters of partially hydrogenated rosins, methyl esters of<br>
rosins, partially hydrogenated methyl esters of rosins, pentaerythritol esters of rosins,<br>
synthetic resins such as terpene resins derived from alpha-pinene, beta-pinene, and/or<br>
d-limonene, and natural terpene resins.<br>
It is common in the industry to combine in a gum base a synthetic elastomer having a<br>
high molecular weight and a synthetic elastomer having a low molecular weight.<br>
Examples of such combinations of are polyisobutylene and styrene-butadiene,<br>
polyisobutylene and polyisoprene, polyisobutylene and isobutylene-isoprene co-<br>
polymer (butyl rubber) and a combination of polyisobutylene, styrene-butadiene<br>
copolymer and isobutylene isoprene copolymer, and all of the above individual<br>
synthetic polymers in admixture with polyvinyl acetate, vinyl acetate-vinyl laurate<br>
copolymers, respectively and mixtures thereof.<br>
According to an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the homopolymer is a<br>
polyester.<br>
According to an embodiment of the invention, the polymerization process to obtain<br>
the biodegradable homopolymer or further synthetic polymers, which is applied in<br>
the chewing gum of the present invention, may be initiated by an initiator such as a<br>
polyfunctional alcohol, amine or other molecules or compounds with multiple<br>
hydroxyl or other reactive groups or mixtures thereof.<br>
According to an embodiment of the invention, examples of suitable multifunctional<br>
initiators include but are not limited to glycerol, trimethylolpropane, pentaerythritol,<br>
dipentaerythritol, and ethoxylated or propoxylated polyamines.<br>
Furthermore, in a preferred embodiment of the invention, the initiator may be di-<br>
functional, and examples of applicable di-functional initiators include di-functional<br><br>
alcohols, and non-limiting examples include 1,2-propane diol, 1,3-butane diol, other<br>
alkane diols, ethylene glycol, generally alcohols having two hydroxyl groups, and<br>
other di-functional compounds capable of initiating a ring-opening polymerization.<br>
According to an embodiment of the invention, the fraction of initiators in the biode-<br>
gradable polymer being difunctional or higher functional may be regulated, whereby<br>
the degree of linearity and branching may be controlled.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the difunctional initiators comprise at least 50<br>
mol % of the total content of initiator molecules applied. Hereby, a considerable<br>
liniarity may be introduced in the biodegradable polymer according to the present<br>
invention, and a certain desired crystallinity may be obtained. Hereby, the<br>
biodegradable polyester polymer may gain very suitable properties as elastomer<br>
plasticizer, and hence ah advantageous biodegradable resin may be provided in the<br>
chewing gum of the present invention. To increase the liniarity to improve the<br>
crystallinity, plasticizing properties and robustness of the chewing gum in an<br>
embodiment of the invention, the content of difunctional initiators may be raised to<br>
e.g. 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, or about 100% of the total content of moles initiator<br>
molecules applied.<br>
Accordingly, a substantially linear polyester polymer may according to an embodi-<br>
ment of the invention comprise above e.g. 50 or 80 percent linear polymer chains.<br>
The biodegradable resinous homopolymers of the present invention are preferably<br>
obtainable by ring-opening polymerization. However, the method of production is<br>
not limiting for the scope of the present invention. As an example, ring-opening<br>
polymerization of lactide is more commonly used as production method than<br>
polycondensation of lactic acid (e.g. a-hydroxypropionic acid). This, however, is<br>
mainly a matter of process conditions and ease of production. As concerns the<br>
resulting polymers, they may be provided with substantially the same composition<br><br>
and properties and being equally applicable in chewing gum according to the present<br>
invention. The naming of such polymers is often regarded inter-changeable, thus the<br>
names poly(lactide) and poly (lactic acid) may be used for the same polymer.<br>
Useful polymers, which may be applied as elastomers in the chewing gum of the<br>
present invention, may generally be prepared by step-growth polymerization of di-,<br>
tri- or higher-functional alcohols with di-, tri- or higher-functional aliphatic or<br>
aromatic carboxylic acids or esters thereof. Likewise, also hydroxy acids or<br>
anhydrides and halides of polyfunctional carboxylic acids may be used as monomers.<br>
The polymerization may involve direct polyesterification or transesterification and<br>
may be catalyzed.<br>
Because polyfunctional carboxylic acids in general are high-melting solids that have<br>
very limited solubility in the polycondensation reaction medium, esters or anhydrides<br>
of the polyfunctional carboxylic acids are often used to overcome this limitation.<br>
Furthermore, polycondensations involving carboxylic acids or anhydrides produce<br>
water as the condensate, which requires high temperatures to be driven off. Thus,<br>
polycondensations involving transesterification of the ester of a polyfunctional acid<br>
are often the preferred process. For example, the dimethyl ester of terephthalic acid<br>
may be used instead of terephthalic acid itself. In this case, methanol rather than<br>
water is condensed, and the former can be driven off more easily than water. Usually,<br>
the reaction is earned out in the bulk (no solvent) and high temperatures and vacuum<br>
are used to remove the by-product and drive the reaction to completion.<br>
Specific examples of aliphatic polyfunctional carboxylic acids, which may be useful<br>
in the preparation of an elastomer applied in the chewing gum of the present<br>
invention, include oxalic, malonic, citric, succinic, malic, tartaric, fumaric, maleic,<br>
glutaric, glutamic, adipic, glucaric, pimelic, suberic, azelaic, sebacic, dodecanedioic<br>
acid, etc. Likewise, specific examples of aromatic polyfunctional carboxylic acids<br><br>
may be terephthalic, isophthalic, phthalic, trimellitic, pyromellitic and naphthalene<br>
1,4-, 2,3-, 2,6-dicarboxylic acids and the like.<br>
For the purpose of illustration and not limitation, some examples of carboxylic acid<br>
derivatives, which may be used for preparation of the elastomer used in the chewing<br>
gum of the present invention, include hydroxy acids such as 3-hydroxy propionic<br>
acid and 6-hydroxycaproic acid and anhydrides, halides or esters of acids, for<br>
example dimethyl or diethyl esters, corresponding to the already mentioned acids,<br>
which means esters such as dimethyl or diethyl oxalate, malonate, succinate,<br>
fumarate, maleate, glutarate, adipate, pimelate, suberate, azelate, sebacate,<br>
dodecanedioate, terephthalate, isophthalate, phthalate, etc. Generally speaking,<br>
methyl esters are sometimes more preferred than ethyl esters due to the fact that<br>
higher boiling alcohols are more difficult to remove than lower boiling alcohols.<br>
The usually preferred polyfunctional alcohols contain 2 to 100 carbon atoms as for<br>
instance polyglycols and polyglycerols.<br>
In the polymerization of an elastomer for use in the chewing gum of the present<br>
invention, some applicable examples of alcohols, which may be employed as such or<br>
as derivatives thereof, include polyols such as ethylene glycol, 1,2-propanediol, 1,3-<br>
propanediol, 1,3-butanediol, 1,4-butanediol, 1,6-hexanediol, diethylene glycol, 1,4-<br>
cyclohexanediol, 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol, neopentyl glycol, glycerol,<br>
trimethylolpropane, pentaerythritol, sorbitol, mannitol, etc.<br>
Generally, the elastomer polymers used in the chewing gum of the present invention<br>
may be homopolymers, copolymers or terpolymers, including graft- and block-<br>
polymers.<br>
Further suitable examples of additional environmentally or biologically degradable<br>
chewing gum base polymers, which may be applied in accordance with the gum base<br>
of the present invention, include degradable polyesters, polycarbonates, polyester<br><br>
amides, polypeptides, homopolymers of amino acids such as polylysine, and proteins<br>
including derivatives hereof such as e.g. protein hydrolysates including a zein<br>
hydrolysate.<br>
In accordance with the general principles in manufacturing a chewing gum within the<br>
scope of the invention, variations of different suitable ingredients are listed and<br>
explained below.<br>
The chewing gum according to the invention may comprise coloring agents.<br>
According to an embodiment of the invention, the chewing gum may comprise color<br>
agents and whiteners such as FD&amp;C-type dyes and lakes, fruit and vegetable<br>
extracts, titanium dioxide and combinations thereof.<br>
Further useful chewing gum base components include antioxidants, e.g. butylated<br>
hydroxytoluene (BHT), butyl hydroxyanisol (BHA), propylgallate and tocopherols,<br>
and preservatives.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the chewing gum comprises softeners in an<br>
amount of about 0 to about 18% by weight of the chewing gum, more typically about<br>
0 to about 12% by weight of the chewing gum.<br>
Waxes may be optional depending on the properties of the individual formulations.<br>
Petroleum waxes aid in the curing of the finished confectionery product made from<br>
the polymer system as well as improve shelf-life and texture. Wax crystal size<br>
influences the release of flavor. Those waxes high in iso-alkanes have a smaller<br>
crystal size than those waxes high in normal-alkanes, especially those with normal-<br>
alkanes of carbon numbers less than'30. The smaller crystal size allows slower<br>
release of flavor since there is more hindrance of the flavor's escape from this wax<br>
versus a wax having larger crystal sizes. The compatibility of polymer systems made<br><br>
using normal-alkanic waxes is less when compared to polymer systems made with<br>
iso-alkanic waxes.<br>
Waxes and fats may moreover be used for the adjustment of the consistency and for<br>
softening of the chewing gum base when preparing chewing gum bases.<br>
Petroleum wax (refined paraffin and microcrystalline wax) and paraffin wax is<br>
composed of mainly straight-chained normal-alkanes and branched iso-alkanes. The<br>
ratio of normal-alkanes to iso-alkanes varies.<br>
The normal-alkanic waxes typically have carbon chain lengths &gt;C-18 but the lengths<br>
are not predominantly longer than C-30. The branched and ring structures are located<br>
near the end of the chain for those waxes that are predominantly normal-alkanic. The<br>
viscosity of normal-alkanic waxes is 
number average molecular weight is 
The iso-alkanic waxes typically have carbon lengths that are predominantly greater<br>
than C-30. The branched chains and ring structures are located randomly along the<br>
carbon chain in those waxes that are predominantly iso-alkanic. The viscosity of iso-<br>
alkanic waxes is greater than 10 mm2/s (at 100 PC) and the combined number<br>
average molecular weight is &gt;600 g/mole.<br>
Synthetic waxes are produced by means atypical of petroleum wax production and<br>
thus are not considered petroleum wax. The synthetic waxes may include waxes<br>
containing branched alkanes and copolymerized with monomers such as but not<br>
limited to propylene and polyethylene and Fischer Tropsch type waxes. Polyethylene<br>
wax is a synthetic wax containing alkane units of varying lengths having attached<br>
thereto ethylene monomers.<br><br>
The natural waxes may include rice bran wax, bees' wax, carnauba wax or candelilla<br>
wax.<br>
In connection with the present invention, any conventionally used and suitable type<br>
of wax and fat may be used, such as for instance rice bran wax, polyethylene wax,<br>
petroleum wax (refined paraffin and microcrystalline wax), paraffin, beeswax,<br>
carnauba wax, candelilla wax, cocoa butter, degreased cocoa powder and any<br>
suitable oil or fat, as e.g. completely or partially hydrogenated vegetable oils or<br>
completely or partially hydrogenated animal fats.<br>
Softeners/emulsifiers may according to the invention be added both in the chewing<br>
gum and the gum base.<br>
The selection of softeners has an influence on the softness of the base. Softeners<br>
modify the texture, cause the hydrophobic and hydrophilic components of the base to<br>
be miscible, and may further plasticize the synthetic polymers of the polymer system.<br>
The emulsifiers, which belong to the group of softeners, provide the polymer system<br>
with water-binding properties, which confer to the polymer system a pleasant smooth<br>
surface and reduce its adhesive properties.<br>
Softeners suitable for use in the polymer system include triglycerides of non-<br>
hydrogenated, partially hydrogenated and fully hydrogenated vegetable oils and<br>
tallow, cocoa butter and degreased cocoa powder and in addition to these the<br>
emulsifiers.<br>
The group of triglycerides include cottonseed, palm, palm kernel, coconut, safflower,<br>
rapeseed, sunflower, tallow, soybean, cocoa butter, medium chained triglycerides<br>
and the like.<br>
The caproic, caprylic, capric, myristic, lauric and palmitic fatty acids of the<br><br>
triglycerides tend to plasticize the synthetic elastomers more than triglycerides<br>
containing predominantly stearic fatty acid.<br>
To the group of emulsifiers belong the monoglycerides, diglycerides, acetylated<br>
mono and diglycerides, distilled mono- and diglycerides, glycerol monostearate,<br>
propylene glycol monostearate, Na-, K-, Mg- and Ca-stearates, glycerol triacetate,<br>
fatty acid monoglycerides (e.g. stearic, palmitic, oleic and linoleic acids), lactic acid<br>
esters and acetic acid esters of mono- and diglycerides, sugar esters of edible fatty<br>
acids also referred to as sucrose polyesters including those disclosed in WO<br>
00/25598 hereby included by reference, lecithin and hydroxylated lecithin, most of<br>
these may contain triglyceride levels less than 2 percent by weight from their<br>
manufacturing processing,<br>
The softeners including the emulsifiers may be used alone or at least two or more in<br>
combination.<br>
Fillers used in polymer system modify the texture of the polymer system and aid in<br>
processing. Particle size has an effect on cohesiveness, density and processing<br>
characteristics of the polymer system and its compounding. The smaller the particle<br>
size, the more dense and cohesive the final polymer system. Also, by selecting fillers<br>
based on their particle size distribution, initial mass compounding may be varied,<br>
thus allowing alteration of the compounding characteristics of the initial mass during<br>
polymer system processing and ultimately the final chew characteristics of gums<br>
made from these polymer systems.<br>
Fillers suitable for use in the polymer system include magnesium and calcium<br>
carbonate, ground limestone and silicate types such as magnesium and aluminum<br>
silicate, kaolin and clay, aluminum oxide, silicium oxide, talc, as well as titanium<br>
oxide, mono-, di- and tricalcium phosphate, sodium sulphate, cellulose polymers<br>
such as ethyl, methyl and wood or mixtures thereof.<br><br>
Talc filler may be used in the polymer system and confectionery product of the<br>
present invention that may come in contact with or employ acid flavors or provide an<br>
acidic environment needed to prevent degradation of an artificial sweetener by<br>
reacting with calcium carbonate type fillers. Mean particle size for calcium carbonate<br>
and talc fillers typically range from about 0.1 micron to about 15 microns.<br>
The fillers may also include natural organic fibers such as fruit vegetable fibers,<br>
grain, rice, cellulose and combinations thereof.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the chewing gum comprises filler in an amount<br>
of about 0 to about 50% by weight of the chewing gum, more typically about 5 to<br>
about 20% by weight of the chewing gum.<br>
In addition to a, typically, water insoluble gum base portion, a typical chewing gum<br>
includes a water soluble bulk portion and one or more flavoring agents. The water-<br>
soluble portion may include bulk sweeteners, high intensity sweeteners, flavoring<br>
agents, softeners, emulsifiers, colors, acidulants, fillers, antioxidants, and other<br>
components that provide desired attributes.<br>
Suitable bulk sweeteners include both sugar and non-sugar sweetening components.<br>
Bulk sweeteners typically constitute from about 5 to about 95% by weight of the<br>
chewing gum, more typically about 20 to about 80% by weight such as 30 to 60% by<br>
weight of the gum.<br>
Useful sugar sweeteners are saccharide-containing components commonly known in<br>
the chewing gum art including, but not limited to, sucrose, dextrose, maltose,<br>
dextrins, trehalose, D-tagatose, dried invert sugar, fructose, levulose, galactose, corn<br>
syrup solids, and the like, alone or in combination.<br><br>
Sorbitol can be used as a non-sugar sweetener. Other useful non-sugar sweeteners in-<br>
clude, but are not limited to, other sugar alcohols such as mannitol, xylitol,<br>
hydrogenated starch hydrolysates, maltitol, isomalt, erythritol, lactitol and the like,<br>
alone or in combination.<br>
High-intensity artificial sweetening agents can also be used alone or in combination<br>
with the above sweeteners. Preferred high-intensity sweeteners include, but are not<br>
limited to sucralose, aspartame, salts of acesulfame, alitame, neotame, twinsweet,<br>
saccharin and its salts, cyclamic acid and its salts, glycyrrhizin, dihydrochalcones,<br>
thaumatin, monellin, stevioside and the like, alone or in combination. In order to<br>
provide longer lasting sweetness and flavor perception, it may be desirable to<br>
encapsulate or otherwise control the release of at least a portion of the artificial<br>
sweetener. Techniques such as wet granulation, wax granulation, spray drying, spray<br>
chilling, fluid bed coating, coascervation, encapsulation in yeast cells and fiber<br>
extrusion may be used to achieve the desired release characteristics. Encapsulation of<br>
sweetening agents can also be provided using another chewing gum component such<br>
as a resinous compound.<br>
Usage level of the high intensity artificial sweetener will vary considerably and will<br>
depend on factors such as potency of the sweetener, rate of release, desired sweetness<br>
of the product, level and type of flavor used and cost considerations. Thus, the active<br>
level of high potency artificial sweetener may vary from about 0 to about S% by<br>
weight, preferably 0.001 to about 5% by weight. When carriers used for encapsu-<br>
lation are included, the usage level of the encapsulated sweetener will be<br>
proportionately higher.<br>
Combinations of sugar and/or non-sugar sweeteners can be used in the chewing gum<br>
formulation processed in accordance with the invention. Additionally, the softener<br>
may also provide additional sweetness such as aqueous sugar or alditol solutions.<br><br>
If a low-calorie gum is desired, a low-caloric bulking agent can be used. Examples of<br>
low caloric bulking agents include polydextrose, Raftilose, Raftilin,<br>
fructooligosaccharides (NutraFlora®), palatinose oligosaccharides; guar gum<br>
hydrolysates (e.g. Sun Fiber®) or indigestible dextrins (e.g. Fibersol®). However,<br>
other low-calorie bulking agents can be used.<br>
The chewing gum according to the present invention may contain aroma agents and<br>
flavoring agents including natural and synthetic flavorings e.g. in the form of natural<br>
vegetable components, essential oils, essences, extracts, powders, including acids<br>
and other substances capable of affecting the taste profile. Examples of liquid and<br>
powdered flavorings include coconut, coffee, chocolate, vanilla, grape fruit, orange,<br>
lime, menthol, liquorice, caramel aroma, honey aroma, peanut, walnut, cashew,<br>
hazelnut, almonds, pineapple, strawberry, raspberry, tropical fruits, cherries,<br>
cinnamon, peppermint, wintergreen, spearmint, eucalyptus, and mint, fruit essence<br>
such as from apple, pear, peach, strawberry, apricot, raspberry, cherry, pineapple,<br>
and plum essence. The essential oils include peppermint, spearmint, menthol,<br>
eucalyptus, clove oil, bay oil, anise; thyme, cedar leaf oil, nutmeg, and oils of the<br>
fruits mentioned above.<br>
The chewing gum flavor may be a natural flavoring agent, which is freeze-dried, pre-<br>
ferably in the form of a powder, slices or pieces or combinations thereof. The particle<br>
size may be less than 3 mm, less than 2 mm or more preferred less than 1 mm, calcu-<br>
lated as the longest dimension of the particle. The natural flavoring agent may in a<br>
form where the particle size is from about 3 µm to 2 mm, such as from 4 µm to 1<br>
mm. Preferred natural flavoring agents include seeds from fruit e.g. from strawberry,<br>
blackberry and raspberry.<br>
Various synthetic flavors, such as mixed fruit flavors may also be used in the present<br>
chewing gum centers. As indicated above, the aroma agent may be used in quantities<br>
smaller than those conventionally used. The aroma agents and/or flavors may be used<br><br>
in the amount from 0.01 to about 30% by weight of the final product depending on<br>
the desired intensity of the aroma and/or flavor used. Preferably, the content of<br>
aroma/flavor is in the range of 0.2 to 3% by weight of the total composition.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the flavoring agents comprise natural and<br>
synthetic flavorings in the form of natural vegetable components, essential oils,<br>
essences, extracts, powders, including acids and other substances capable of affecting<br>
the taste profile.<br>
Further chewing gum ingredients, which may be included in the chewing gum<br>
according to the present invention, include surfactants and/or solubilisers, especially<br>
when pharmaceutically or biologically active ingredients are present. As examples of<br>
types of surfactants to be used as solubilisers in a chewing gum composition<br>
according to the invention, reference is made to H.P. Fiedler, Lexikon der Hilfstoffe<br>

In one embodiment of the invention, the flavor may be used as taste masking in<br>
chewing gum comprising active ingredients, which by themselves have undesired<br>
taste or which alter the taste of the formulation.<br>
The chewing gum may optionally contain usual additives, such as binding agents,<br>
acidulants, fillers, coloring agents, preservatives, and antioxidants.<br>
Materials to be used for the above-mentioned encapsulation methods for sweeteners<br>
might e.g. include Gelatine, Wheat protein, Soya protein, Sodium caseinate, Caseine,<br>
Gum arabic, Mod. starch, Hydrolyzed starches (maltodextrines), Alginates, Pectin,<br>
Carregeenan, Xanthan gum, Locus bean gum, Chitosan, Bees wax, Candelilla wax,<br>
Camauba wax, Hydrogenated vegetable oils, Zein and/or Sucrose.<br><br>
In general, chewing gum may he manufactured by sequentially adding the various<br>
chewing gum ingredients to a commercially available mixer known in the art.<br>
A mixing of chewing gum and gum base may generally be performed by a batch or a<br>
continuous processing technique. An example of basic applicable mixing principles<br>
is explained below.<br>
After the initial ingredients have been thoroughly mixed, the chewing gum mass is<br>
discharged from the mixer and shaped into the desired form such as by rolling into<br>
sheets and cutting into sticks, extruded into chunks or casting into pellets.<br>
Generally, the ingredients may be mixed by first melting the gum base and adding it<br>
to the running mixer. Colors, active agents and/or emulsifiers may also be added at<br>
this time. A softener such as glycerin may also be added at this time, along with<br>
syrup and a portion of the bulking agent/sweetener. Further portions of the bulking<br>
agent/sweetener may then be added to the mixer. A flavoring agent is typically added<br>
with the final portion of the bulking agent/sweetener. A high-intensity sweetener is<br>
preferably added after the final portion of bulking agent and flavor has been added.<br>
The entire mixing procedure typically takes from five to fifteen minutes, but longer<br>
mixing times may sometimes be required. Those skilled in the art will recognize that<br>
many variations of the above described procedure may be followed. Including the<br>
one-step method described in US patent application 2004/0115305 hereby<br>
incorporated as reference.<br>
The final chewing gums are formed by extrusion, compression, rolling and may be<br>
centre filled with liquids and/or solids in any form.<br>
The chewing gum according to the invention may be formed as conventional pellets,<br>
centre filled, etc.<br><br>
The chewing gum according to the present invention may also be provided with an<br>
outer coating, which may be a hard coating, a soft coating, a film coating, or a<br>
coating of any type that is known in the art, or a combination of such coatings. The<br>
coating may typically constitute 0.1 to 75 percent by weight of a coated chewing<br>
gum piece.<br>
One preferred outer coating type is a hard coating, which term is including sugar<br>
coatings and sugar-free (or sugarless) coatings and combinations thereof. The object<br>
of hard coating is to obtain a sweet, crunchy layer, which is appreciated by the<br>
consumer and to protect the gum centers. In a typical process of providing the<br>
chewing gum centers with a protective sugar coating the gum centers are<br>
successively treated in suitable coating equipment with aqueous solutions of<br>
crystallizable sugar such as sucrose or dextrose, which, depending on the stage of<br>
coating reached, may contain other functional ingredients, e.g. fillers, colors, etc.<br>
In one presently preferred embodiment, the coating agent applied in a hard coating<br>
process is a sugarless coating agent, e.g. a polyol including as examples sorbitol,<br>
maltitol, mannitol, xylitol, erythritol, lactitol and isomalt or e.g. a mono- di-saccha-<br>
ride including as example trehalose.<br>
Or alternatively a sugar free soft coating e.g. comprising alternately applying to the<br>
centers a syrup of a polyol or a mono- di-saccharide, including as examples sorbitol,<br>
maltitol, mannitol, xylitol, erythritol, lactitol, isomalt and trehalose.<br>
In further useful embodiments a film coating is provided by film-forming agents<br>
such as a cellulose derivative, a modified starch, a dextrin, gelatine, zein, shellec,<br>
gum arabic, a vegetable gum, a synthetic polymer, etc. or a combination thereof.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the outer coating comprises at least one additive<br>
component selected from the group comprising of a binding agent, a moisture-<br><br>
absorbing component, a film-forming agent, a dispersing agent, an antisticking<br>
component, a bulking agent, a flavoring agent, a coloring agent, a pharmaceutically<br>
or cosmetically active component, a lipid component, a wax component, a sugar, an<br>
acid<br>
A coated chewing gum center according to the invention may have any form, shape or dimension that permits the chewing gum center to be coated using any<br>
conventional coating process.<br>
The gum centre of coated chewing gum element according to the invention can have<br>
any form, shape or dimension that permits the chewing gum centre to be coated using<br>
any conventional coating process. Accordingly, the gum centre may be e.g. in a form<br>
selected from a pellet, a cushion-shaped pellet, a stick, a tablet, a chunk, a pastille, a<br>
pill, a ball and a sphere, and typically the weight of a gum center may be 0.5 to 5<br>
grams.<br>
Note that the description, and specifically the claims, designates e.g. 1000 as 1,000<br>
and ½ as 0.5.<br>
The following non-limiting examples illustrate the manufacturing of a chewing gum<br>

EXAMPLE 3<br>
Preparation of polyester resin obtained by ring-opening polymerization<br>
A resin sample is produced using a cylindrical glass, jacketed 10 L pilot reactor<br>

overhead stirrer, nitrogen gas inlet tube, thermometer, and distillation head for<br>
removal of methanol. To the kettle are charged 83.50 g (0.43 mole) dimethyl<br>
terephthalate, 99.29 g (0.57 mole) dimethyl adipate, 106.60 g (1.005 mole)<br>
di(ethylene glycol) and 0.6 g calcium acetate monohydrate. Under nitrogen, the<br>
mixture is slowly heated with stirring until all components become molten (120- 140°C). Heating and stirring are continued and methanol is continuously distilled.<br>
The temperature slowly rises in the range 150-200°C until the evolution of methanol<br>
ceases. Heating is discontinued and the content is allowed to cool to about 100°C.<br>
The reactor lid is removed and the molten polymer is carefully poured into a<br>
receiving vessel.<br>
Characterization of the product indicates Mn = 40,000g/mol and Mw = 190,000g/mol<br>

EXAMPLE 7<br>
Preparation of gum bases<br>
The process of preparing gum bases is carried out in the following way: The gum<br>
base components are added to a mixing kettle provided with mixing means like e.g.<br>
horizontally placed Z-shaped arms. The kettle has been preheated to a temperature of<br>
about 140°C. The mixture is mixed for 30-120 minutes until the whole mixture<br>
becomes homogeneous. The mixture is then discharged into the pan and allowed to<br>
cool to room temperature.<br><br><br><br>
EXAMPLE 8<br>
Preparation of chewing gum<br>
The gum bases of example 7 were used in the preparation of peppermint flavored<br>
chewing gum formulations 1001-1009 with the basic formulations shown in table 2<br>
and where gum base 001 is applied for the preparation of chewing gum 1001, gum<br>
base 002 is applied for the preparation of chewing gum 1002 and so forth.<br><br>
Example 9:<br>
Evaluation of the chewing gum of table 2.<br>
A test-setup for the evaluation of non-tack properties of the chewing gums of table 2<br>
was established. The test involved the steps of<br>
-	chewing of chewing gum lumps of the chewing gum formulations of table 2<br>
in a chewing machine in 8 minutes,<br>
-	fastening of the chewing gum lumps on concrete slabs,<br><br>
- evaluating the chewing gum lumps in three different controlled climate<br>
setups:<br>
(a)	0 °C<br>
(b)	21 °C og 55% RH<br>
(c)	30 °C og 70% RH<br>
The chewing gum lumps were evaluated visually and by attempting removal of the<br>
chewing gum lumps by means of a spatula.<br>
It was generally observed that the non-tack properties of the tested samples had an<br>
improved non-tackiness compared to the comparative sample 1001 at the low test<br>
temperature 0 °C of test (a).<br>
It was furthermore concluded that the chewing gum formulations 1003,1004, 1006,<br>
1008 and 1009 featured an improved non-tackiness at all temperatures (a), (b) and<br>
(c), thereby indicating that the non-tackiness is depending less on environment<br>
temperature.<br>
A further test with respect to texture of the chewing gum formulations 1003,1004,<br>
1006,1008 and 1009 indicated that the best texture could be obtained by the use of<br>
the lowest -molecular weight resin, namely chewing gum samples 1004,1006, and<br>
1009.<br>
EXAMPLE 10:<br>
Preparation of gum bases<br>
A further number of gum bases were prepared according to the process described in<br>
example 7 now with a slightly changed composition where the gum bases comprises<br>
conventional elastomer and a homopolymer as a resin.<br><br><br>
EXAMPLE 11<br>
Chewing gum formulations based on the gum bases of example 10 are illustrated in<br>
table 4.<br><br><br>
Example 12:<br>
Evaluation of the chewing gum of table 4.<br>
The chewing gum 2009 formed on the basis of the gum base 209 is dominated by the<br>
elastomer. The elastomer content in the gum base of this chewing gum is about 45%<br>
(w/w) and regarded to be too high in combination with the homopolymer but could<br>
be compensated by a further softening and modification of the elastomer blend.<br>
Specifically, a reduction of the molecular weight could be considered.<br>
It is on the other hand observed that the desired non-tackiness of the chewing gum is<br>
inferior when the ratio between the resin and elastomer is lower than about 1:5.<br>
The chewing gum 2002, i.e. the chewing gum formed on the basis of an elastomer<br>
content in the gum base of only 1%, lacks the desired chew feel. It is assumed that<br>
this lack of the desired chew feel resides in the very low elastomer content.<br><br>
Chewing gums 2003 to 2008 were regarded acceptable with respect to both chew feel<br>
and tackiness.<br>
According to an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the chewing gum may<br>
be prepared with about 2-15% by weight of a syrup blend; wherein the syrup blend<br>
includes about 25-45% glycerin, about 55-75% hydrogenated starch hydrolysates.<br><br>
