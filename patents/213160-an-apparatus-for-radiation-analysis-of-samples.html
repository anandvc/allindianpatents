[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
"AN APPARATUS FOR RADIATION ANALYSIS OF SAMPLES"<br>
COLIN ROY JEFFRESS, of 12 Mataro Road, Hope Valley, South Australia 5090, Australia,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br><br><br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
THIS invention concerns an automated sample analysis system. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present system will be described in relation to biological material specifically sugarcane but those skilled in the art would appreciate that timber, forage, animal products, food products generally including raw and processed materials are handled by such systems. The system may be  modified to handle plastics, rubber and mineral products. The analysis utilises a near infra red (NIR) spectrometer but ultrasound, microwave, nuclear irradiation and capacitative testing devices are described in the literature. It is useful if the system is capable of receiving input from control or recognition devices and controlling other devices as part of its place in a production or information chain.<br>
It is customary for a growers" payment to depend on the extractable sugar. The grower can be penalised or rewarded of the factors such as excess fibre and impurities.<br>
Mills commonly provide laboratories adjacent the growers" truck entry to the Mill where samples are prepared manually by appropriate grinding. Wet chemistry processes follow and a result is generated in 4-8 hours. "Automating such a process presents a variety of problems, typically the creation of a physical form which can be read by the testing device. A sample must be representative of the tissue extract. It must be presented suitably for a reading to emerge. The current sample must not be contaminated by the previous sample. The sample must be disposed of so that a new reading is obtainable. The procedure must offer precision in reading and require minimal human supervision. Preferably the apparatus should be automated as by logic circuit or micro processor control.<br>
. WO 93/15470 describes a system suitable for monitoring coal input to electricity generating stations. A motor driven, endless conveyor drives multiple coal samples beneath a linear array of sensors. It stops and starts to give each sensor in turn exposure to the sample. Infrared, microwave and gamma ray radiation are utilised to give information about the ratio of C-H to O-H bonds; free moisture and S/H/O ratios. A mathematical matrix is generated and thereafter coefficients are calculated.<br>
            Biological miaterials present additional Asample carrying<br>
fruit juice, blood or other adhesive liquid tends to contaminate subsequent<br>
samples.		<br>

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The apparatus aspect of this invention provides apparatus for radiation analysis of finely divided test material comprising a radiatiorTsensor and means capable of conveying the sample past the sensor at a controlled presentation height and surface condition. Preferably the apparatus performs spectrographic analysis of samples of finely divided biological material and comprises a spectrographic sensor and means capable of conveying the sample past the sensors such that the surface of the sample remains at a predetermined reading distance from the sensor.<br>
Usually the apparatus utilises predetermined factors. For some<br>
materials adjustment may be necessary and therefore control is useful.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOM PANYING DRAWINGS	<br>
In order that the present invention can be clearly understood and put into practical effect the description will now refer to the drawings which show non-limiting embodiments of the invention, wherein:-<br>
Figure 1 is a plan of the apparatus;<br>
Figure 2 is a side elevation;<br>
Figure 3 is an end elevation;<br>
Figure 4 is an enlarged side view of the sensor and depth regulator zone in Figure 2;<br>
Figure 5 is a diagrammatic side elevation of an alternative version; and<br>
Figure 6 is a diagrammatic end elevation of Figure 5.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS VERSION 1<br>
The apparatus is an enclosed unit intended to function at a sugar mill adjacent the truck entry to the Mill. The unit contains an infeed section and fibrator, a cane presentation conveyor, a NIR reading system, electronic and mechanical control systems and a disposal system which discharges to a bin.<br>
Referring now to the drawings 1 to 4, an endless conveyor 2 has four rows of interleaved side guards 4 which define a central sample channel 6 and a pair of adjacent deeper overflow channels 8,10. The conveyor is driven by an electric motor at an adjustable feed speed of 0.5-2m/min.<br>
The fibrator is a rotary cutter 12 driven by a three phase brake motor 14. The cane pieces constituting the sample drop from an infeed conveyor 16 where the cutter reduces them to needle-shaped fibres 10-15mm long, Centrifugad force expels the cane as a stream of fibres 10-15mm long components which the cutting operation exposes but all juice is retained. The fibrated samples is directed by the diverter 18 into the sample channel 6.<br>
3<br><br>
An uneven layer of sample fibres builds progressively on the moving conveyor. The conveyor advances the fibre mass towards the depth regulator which comprises a stainless steel plate 20 (see Figure 4) which is free to tilt about a horizontal hinge axis 22. The leading end of the plate carries an upstanding blade 24 which diverts the excess into the overflow channels 8, 10.<br>
A solenoid 26 above the plate 20 receives 24vdc pulses at 10Hz from the controller 28. The solenoid operates shuttle valve 30 which reverses air supply to ram 32. The ram reciprocates plate 20 through crank 34. The plate settles the pile into a carpet whose depth is fixed by the arcuate heel 36 at the trailing hinge end of the plate. The heel and plate together with the conveyor surface and the side guards create a carpet 38 of precise dimension and packing density.<br>
As the carpet advances, a flap sensor 40 senses the advancing edge of the carpet. Contact 42 opens and contact 44 closes. They signal the adjacent NIR reading head 48 to begin reading the advancing material. The NIR spectrometer in console 50 is a stand alone "direct light" instrument FOSS TECATOR (Sweden) with the reading head 48 connected by a fibre bundle. The spectrometer requires constant temperature enclosure and non-interruptible power supply. For this purpose the apparatus has an air conditioned cabinet to house the instrument and electronics at 24°C. A compressed air supply and vortex cooler provide auxiliary cooling. These components are not shown in the drawings.<br>
As the carpet height diminishes the flap sensor drops and readings cease. Contacts 42, 44 operate to switch off the solenoid and speed up the conveyor. The carpet travels undisturbed well beyond the reading head into zone 52 before falling off the conveyor. This prevents cracks or voids in the part of the carpet being read. The conveyor dumps the sample onto a separate conveyor 54 which takes it to a waste bin (not shown). A typical sample cycle is 3 minutes. The console 50 houses the power supply, interface board, relay outputs and control circuitry for the spectrometer. A strip printer delivers the numerals and codes which record the contents of the sample identifying batch/grower and the like. The information is stored in a database and recorded for further analysis.<br>
Where rapid multiple readings are needed, say of the order of a minute, a small apparatus is used which has no integral fibrator.   Referring<br>
4<br><br>
riow to Figures 5 and 6, a motorised shredder 60 of suitable capacity generates fibrated cane material from 200mm pieces and these are loaded onto the feed box 62 conveyor of the machine by hand using a scoop. A conveyor 68 channel has four transverse walls 66 which create two reading compartments 68, 70 about 800x150x45mm between the walls 66. The feed box 62 is filled manually. The feed box delivers shredded material neatly into the first compartment as shown. At an operators signal, the conveyor advances. The operator levels the compartment with a blade 72. A controlled tamping plate 74 descends on the compartment imposing predetermined packing density on the sample i.e. the ratio of voids to solids is the same in each cycle. The conveyor advances between automatic stops 76, 78. The sensor head 48 is located over the filled compartment and scans the surface of the material. At the end of the cycle the conveyor advances, dumping the contents of the first compartment.<br>
An apparatus for radiation analysis of samples of finely divided biological material passing by a sensor (48), characterized in that the system comprises a depth regulator (20,24,36,72,74) and means (2) capable of conveying the sample past the sensor (48) such that an upper surface of the sample remains at a set reading distance from the sensor (48), wherein the depth regulator (20,24,36,72,74) cooperates with the conveyor (2) to deflect excess material and present a carpet (38) of sample material of set height, density and surface condition to the sensor (48) at said set reading distance.<br>
The depth regulator is a plate (20) having a leading edge (24) and a trailing edge (36) beneath which the material is, in use, constrained to pass, by the conveyor (2) movement.<br>
The plate (20) is hinged (22) near the trailing edge (36) to define the conveyor surface (6) a tapered zone of consolidation and the plate (20) has means (26, 28, 30, 32, 34) capable of vibrating the plate in order to assist consolidation, preferably at the rate of 5
The apparatus includes means (40, 42, 44) capable of detecting the<br>
presence of the material to be sampled located between the plate (20) and<br>
the sensor (48).	The means are (40, 42, 44) capable of detecting the presence of the material to be sampled located downstream of the sensor (48).<br>
The conveyor is divided into separate parts (6,8,10) and only part (6) of the width of the conveyor (2) is dedicated to the movement of the sample (38), the excess material being free to spill laterally on the remaining width (8,10) of the conveyor (2).<br>
A  sample  depositor   (18)   is  located  upstream  of the  depth  regulator (20,24,36,72,74) lays new sample material on the conveyor (2) so as to cover any remnant of the previous sample eliminating measurement errors , which could result from cross contamination between samples.<br>
- 5 -<br><br>
The conveyor has a channel (6) extending over part of its width capable in use of confining the sample material and an adjacent channel 43,10) for overspill. The conveyor (2) has surface mounted compartments which are chargeable to set controlled reproducible height (72,74) and means (76,78) advance each compartment (63) to a reading position beneath the sensor (48).<br>
The compartments are chargeable to a set controlled reproducible height by means of the compression plate (74) which is capable of exerting a preset tamping pressure on the sample in the compartment prior to reading.<br>
The conveyor (2) is endless and a dumping station (54) is located downstream of the sensor (48).<br>
An apparatus being fully automated for sample analysis of bulk materials comprising a fibrator (12) for finely dividing the material to be analysed, a conveyor (8, 6, 10) downstream of the fibrator (12) for presenting the sample in conjunction with the depth regulator (20, 24, 36) at a controlled height with a controlled surface condition, the sensor (48) detecting properties of the sample by radiation and data processing means for calculating and presenting data derived from the sensor (48).<br>
The depth regulator comprises a manually operable leveler (72) followed by a tamping device (74) applying a controller packing density to the sample.<br>
In a non-illustrated version, two conveyors lie side by side and reading head swings from one to the other.<br>
We have found the advantages of the version 1 to be:<br>
1.	the vastly quicker procedure compared to wet chemistry methods;<br>
2.	reliable comparison between samples is possible;<br>
3.	more economical than a conventional laboratory;<br>
4.	a fresh surface is available for reading because it lies on top of any previous sample remnant;<br>
5.	environmentally friendly through the reductidn or elimination of harmful chemical waste resulting from wet chemistry methods.<br>
Whilst the above has been given by way of illustrative example of the present invention many variations and modifications thereto will be apparent to those skilled in the art without departing from the broad ambit and scope of the invention as set out in the appended claims.<br><br>
