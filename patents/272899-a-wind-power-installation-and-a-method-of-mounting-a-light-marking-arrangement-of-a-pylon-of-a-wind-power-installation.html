Rod-shaped light for marking a tower with lights<br>
Description<br>
	The invention concerns a rod-shaped light for marking a pylon, in<br>
particular of a wind power installation, with lights, comprising a rod-shaped<br>
holder, at the first end of which lighting means and at the second end of<br>
which lighting means connections are arranged. In addition the invention<br>
relates to a wind power installation whose pylon or pylon element is marked<br>
by at least two rod-shaped lights arranged in bores in a pylon wall. The<br>
invention further concerns a method of mounting a light marking<br>
arrangement of a pylon, in particular of a wind power installation.<br>
	The pylons of wind power installations which are usual at the present<br>
time do not have a nighttime lighting arrangement for marking them. To<br>
safeguard air traffic in the proximity of the wind park which frequently is of<br>
quite considerable extent comprising a plurality of individual wind power<br>
installations however a lack of nighttime identification is certainly a<br>
disadvantage as such areas have to be given a wide berth and represent an<br>
obstacle in particular for leisure air traffic.<br>
	DE 103 58 962 A1 discloses a wind power installation comprising a<br>
pylon having at least one outwardly radiating obstruction lighting means,<br>
for which purpose provided in the pylon is at least one opening through<br>
which a supply line is laid to the exterior from the interior of the pylon.<br>
Instead of electric lines for example a light source conductor can be passed<br>
as the supply line through the opening in order then to achieve a desired<br>
light emission characteristic by means of a prism or a lens system.<br>
	The object of the invention is to provide a technical solution which is<br>
as simple and inexpensive as possible for equipping a pylon, in particular of<br>
a wind power installation which has already been erected, or a pylon<br>
element for a wind power installation which is still to be erected, with a light<br>
marking arrangement.<br>
 <br>
2<br>
	With an apparatus of the kind set forth in the opening part of this<br>
specification, in accordance with the invention that object is attained in that<br>
the rod-shaped light can be fitted from the inside through a bore in the<br>
pylon wall so that the lighting means radiate into the surrounding area of<br>
the pylon. In that way, in a very simple and inexpensive fashion, a pylon of<br>
a wind power installation which has already been erected can be retro-fitted<br>
with a light marking arrangement for safeguarding air traffic, at various<br>
heights of the pylon, or a pylon element of a wind power installation which<br>
is still to be erected can be pre-fitted with such a light marking<br>
(arrangement, so that in the erected condition of the pylon it is then only<br>
still necessary to contact the lighting means connections.<br>
	The rod-shaped light according to the invention has lighting means at<br>
its first end and lighting means connections at its second end. The lighting<br>
means are preferably light emitting diodes as nowadays they can be<br>
obtained relatively inexpensively and of such a nature as to produce great<br>
light intensities. Light emitting diodes enjoy a long service life so that the<br>
complication and expenditure in respect of maintenance operations on and<br>
replacement of rod-shaped lights are kept as low as possible. Furthermore<br>
light emitting diodes are very small so that a rod-shaped light is of a small<br>
diameter, in spite of being equipped with a plurality of lighting means of<br>
that kind. The rod-shaped light should be of the smallest possible diameter<br>
at the first end which can be fitted through the pylon wall as large bores in<br>
the pylon wall are to be avoided in consideration of the structural<br>
engineering stresses on the pylon.<br>
	The lighting means connections are connected by means of a plug to<br>
supply lines which are disposed in the interior of the pylon. Those lines are<br>
connected to a central control cabinet which provides for actuation,<br>
preferably in the form of constant current actuation, of the rod-shaped<br>
light. This embodiment is particularly advantageous as in that way no<br>
electronics are required within the rod-shaped light. Such a rod-shaped<br>
light is particularly simple and inexpensive to produce. The operator of the<br>
wind power installation can therefore replace a defective rod-shaped light<br>
by a new one quickly, easily and inexpensively.<br>
 <br>
3<br>
	The lighting means are preferably provided with a signal device in<br>
order to communicate the failure of a lighting means or of the plurality of<br>
lighting means to the operator of the pylon and to be able to change the<br>
rod-shaped light as quickly as possible. That signal device can for example<br>
comprise a photo resistor which provides information about the function of<br>
the lighting means. A preferred embodiment is an extra signalling line as a<br>
signal device, in addition to the supply lines, which is connected to the<br>
lighting means by means of the lighting means connections. In that case<br>
the lighting means are connected in series so that a failed lighting means<br>
interrupts the flow of current and the signalling line passes a corresponding<br>
signal to the central control cabinet and thus to the operator. It would<br>
equally be possible to envisage a parallel circuit for the lighting means,<br>
which would have the advantage that, in the event of a failure of a lighting<br>
means, the other lighting means are not adversely affected in terms of their<br>
operation.<br>
	Preferably a cap is disposed as a protective layer over the lighting<br>
means, to protect the lighting means which are exposed to the weather<br>
from environmental influences, in particular weathering influences. In that<br>
respect a preferred configuration of that cap is a protective layer which is<br>
lined with transparent material. A dome which is disposed over the lighting<br>
means, preferably of glass, is lined preferably with transparent optical<br>
resin, which on the one hand protects the lighting means and seals them<br>
off in relation to the environment while on the other hand however also<br>
serving as means for fixing the lighting means within that dome.<br>
	Preferably a hoop, preferably made from metal, is arranged over that<br>
protective layer in order to ensure protection for the lighting means and the<br>
protective casing from mechanical influences such as for example in relation<br>
to crane operations at the pod or the pylon.<br>
	The bore in the pylon wall, through which the rod-shaped light<br>
according to the invention can be fitted, is preferably horizontal, that is to<br>
say oriented in parallel relationship with the ground, in order to ensure also<br>
horizontal orientation of the lighting means. In a preferred embodiment,<br>
arranged in a horizontal bore in the pylon wall is a sleeve which serves as a<br>
 <br>
4<br>
guide for the rod-shaped light which can be fitted into the pylon wall. The<br>
rod-shaped light is the accurately fitting counterpart to the sleeve which<br>
predetermines optimum positioning of the rod-shaped light in such a way<br>
that the rod-shaped light is both oriented horizontally in the transverse axis<br>
and also the lighting means which are preferably arranged in a line therein<br>
are disposed horizontally.<br>
	In addition provided on the sleeve or on the protective hoop is a<br>
device which defines the optimum position of the rod-shaped light, in which<br>
the rod-shaped light projects out of the pylon to such an extent that it<br>
emits light into a solid angle which is as large as possible. In that<br>
arrangement, disposed at the inside of the pylon wall is a support which<br>
permits optimum adjustment of the sleeve or the rod-shaped light<br>
respectively.<br>
	The lighting means are also preferably arranged in a line in order to<br>
ensure light emission which is as good as possible, in a horizontal direction.<br>
In such an embodiment a pylon, preferably of a wind power installation, or<br>
a pylon element, is provided with at least two rod-shaped lights which are<br>
arranged thereon in a plane of the pylon, in such a way that it can be<br>
marked with lights in a solid angle of 360º.<br>
	In accordance with the invention, an arrangement for marking a<br>
pylon, in particular of a wind power installation, with lights, is mounted in<br>
such a way that the first end of a rod-shaped light is moved from the inside<br>
through a bore in the pylon wall, into a position of being visible from the<br>
outside, and the lighting means connections of the second end of the rod-<br>
shaped light are connected to supply lines disposed in the interior of the<br>
pylon. That permits simple and inexpensive retro-fitment to a pylon which<br>
has already been erected. That only requires operations which can be<br>
carried out from a platform disposed in the interior of the pylon so that<br>
there is no need for any complicated and expensive crane operations at the<br>
outside wall of the pylon. A hole which is intended for the rod-shaped light<br>
is drilled in the pylon wall, preferably of a diameter of only a few<br>
centimetres, in order not to adversely affect the structural engineering<br>
aspects of the pylon. The rod-shaped light is of a small diameter at the first<br>
 <br>
5<br>
end so that it can be fitted into that bore in a closely fitting accurate<br>
relationship. The part which remains in the interior of the pylon serves for<br>
orientation of the rod-shaped light.<br>
	Based on the rod-shaped light according to the invention the<br>
invention concerns a wind power installation or a pylon element, wherein at<br>
least two rod-shaped lights are mounted to a pylon of a wind power<br>
installation or to a pylon element in such a way that said pylon or said pylon<br>
element is visibly marked in all directions which are relevant to air traffic. In<br>
that case the rod-shaped lights project out of the pylon to such an extent<br>
that for example two rod-shaped lights each emit light in 180º respectively<br>
or three rod-shaped lights each emit light in 120º respectively or similar<br>
embodiments in which at least two rod-shaped lights mark the complete<br>
space around the outside of the pylon with lights. In that respect, an<br>
embodiment which is to be preferred is one in which as few bores as<br>
possible have to be drilled in the pylon wall in order to light up a solid angle<br>
which is as large as possible, <br>
	The option of retro-fitting a pylon or equipping a pylon element, in<br>
particular of a wind power installation, with the light, is particularly<br>
advantageous in regard to the solution according to the invention. The<br>
lighting means can be inexpensively obtained and enjoy a long service life,<br>
which minimises the ongoing costs for maintenance of the arrangement<br>
when already installed. As the rod-shaped light according to the invention is<br>
of a simple structure it can be manufactured in large numbers at relatively<br>
low prices. The rod-shaped light according to the invention is particularly<br>
advantageous as, in the event of failure of an individual lighting means, the<br>
complete light can be quickly and easily replaced from the interior of the<br>
pylon.<br>
	Further advantageous configurations of the invention are recited in<br>
further appendant claims.<br>
	The advantage of the rod-shaped light according to the invention is<br>
further that both the individual pylon elements are equipped with the rod-<br>
shaped light according to the invention before assembly of the pylon and<br>
 <br>
6<br>
also that the pylon when already installed can be retro-fitted therewith from<br>
the inside.<br>
	An embodiment by way of example of the invention is described in<br>
greater detail hereinafter with reference to the drawings in which:<br>
	Figure 1 shows a perspective view of a pylon of a wind power <br>
installation equipped with rod-shaped lights according to the invention<br>
arranged in two planes of the pylon,<br>
	Figure 2 shows a section through the transverse axis of a pylon with<br>
two installed rod-shaped lights according to the invention which are not<br>
shown true to scale,<br>
	Figure 3 shows a cross-section through the longitudinal axis of a<br>
pylon with an installed rod-shaped light according to the invention,<br>
	Figure 4 shows a cross-section through the longitudinal axis of a rod-<br>
shaped light according to the invention,<br>
	Figure 5 shows a cross-section through the pylon wall and plan views<br>
of a ramming protection and a pipe clamp,<br>
	Figure 6 shows various views of a rod-shaped light according to the<br>
invention,<br>
	Figure 7 shows a cross-section through a pylon wall and plan views<br>
of the ramming protection and the pipe clamp with installed rod-shaped<br>
light,<br>
	Figure 8 shows a cross-section through a pylon with catwalk rings or<br>
grating grids respectively, and<br>
	Figure 9 shows cross-sections through a pylon wall with catwalk rings<br>
or grating grids respectively.<br>
	Figure 1 shows a pylon 1 of a wind power installation which is<br>
erected on a foundation 5. The machine pod 2 and the rotor blades 3<br>
arranged thereon are disposed at the upper end of the pylon 1. Mounted on<br>
the pylon in two pylon planes are light marking arrangements 4 so that the<br>
pylon is visible to air traffic from far away.<br>
	Figure 2 shows a cross-section through the pylon 1 of the wind<br>
power installation. Arranged in the pylon wall 11 are two rod-shaped lights<br>
10 which are fitted out of the interior space 7 through bores in the pylon<br>
 <br>
7<br>
wall 11 and which emit light into the area 9 surrounding the pylon. In order<br>
to protect the lighting means 14 of the rod-shaped light 10 from mechanical<br>
environmental influences, disposed over the rod-shaped light 10 is a<br>
protective device 12 which can preferably also serve at the same time for<br>
correct positioning when the rod-shaped light 10 is installed in the pylon<br>
wall 11.<br>
	Figure 3 shows the way in which the rod-shaped light 10 according to<br>
the invention is mounted in the pylon wall 11. The rod-shaped light 10 fits<br>
in accurately fitting relationship in a bore provided for that purpose in the<br>
pylon wall 11, wherein accurately fitting and horizontally optimised<br>
adjustment of the rod-shaped light 10 is achieved by means of a sleeve<br>
(not shown) which is introduced into the bore and guide means 16 which<br>
are fixed to the rod-shaped light. The first end of the rod-shaped light 10<br>
which emits light into the area 9 around the pylon projects out of the pylon<br>
to such an extent that the lighting means 14 are visible from the outside in<br>
a solid angle which is of maximum magnitude. A protective layer 13, for<br>
example an optical resin, is arranged over those lighting means 14 in order.<br>
to protect them from weathering influences. Disposed over that part of the<br>
rod-shaped light 10, which projects out of the pylon, is a protective hoop<br>
12 in order to protect the rod-shaped light 10 with the lighting means 14<br>
and the protective layer 13 from mechanical damage.<br>
	Arranged at the second end of the rod-shaped light 10 which projects<br>
into the interior 7 of the pylon are the lighting means connections 15 which<br>
are to be contacted with supply lines provided for that purpose in the<br>
interior 7 of the pylon.<br>
	Figure 4 shows the lighting means 14 which is coated with a<br>
protective layer 13, for example optical resin, at the first end of the rod-<br>
shaped light 10 according to the invention. In the illustrated embodiment<br>
five light emitting diodes are arranged in a line, as the lighting means 14,<br>
so that they emit light in a horizontal plane in a solid angle of 180º.<br>
	Based on the rod-shaped light according to the invention the<br>
invention also concerns a configuration in which rod-shaped lights for<br>
marking the pylon with lights are arranged in a plurality of planes on the<br>
 <br>
8<br>
pylon. It is also possible to envisage marking the pylon with lights over less<br>
than 360º in the surrounding area if for example that is not required by<br>
virtue of the area around the pylon. The lighting means of the rod-shaped<br>
light can be arranged in a departure from a horizontal line. The mechanical<br>
protective hoop can preferably be replaced by a mechanical protective<br>
device of another design configuration, for example a grid or a transparent<br>
dome of a mechanically robust material.<br>
	An embodiment of the invention is described in greater detail<br>
hereinafter. Figure 5A shows a cross-section through the pylon wall 11 of a<br>
concrete segment with a sleeve 17 which is cast therein and to the inner<br>
end 17A and the outer end 17B of which is welded a respective plate 18<br>
and 19 respectively. That unit is also cast in place in production of the<br>
precast concrete member and is then fixedly incorporated in the concrete at<br>
the predetermined position, with the required orientation. Each of the<br>
plates 18, 19 has through holes 181 and 191 respectively, behind which<br>
nuts 182 and 192 respectively are welded on so that screws can be<br>
screwed through those plates. <br>
	Screwed to the outer plate 19 is the so-called ramming protection 20<br>
which is shown as a plan view in Figure 5C. That ramming protection 20 is<br>
preferably a plate with a central through hole 201 for the rod-shaped light<br>
and protective hoops 202 which are arranged above and below that through<br>
hole 201 and which form the actual ramming protection. That configuration<br>
also has holes 203 with which that ramming protection 20 can be screwed<br>
to the outer plate 19.<br>
	The inner plate 18 is prepared for fixing the rod-shaped light by<br>
means of the so-called pipe clamp 21, as is shown in a plan view in Figure<br>
5B. The view of the pipe clamp 21 shows two screws 211 with which it can<br>
be screwed on to the inner plate 18. Disposed at the centre of the pipe<br>
clamp 21 there is again an opening 212 through which the rod-shaped light<br>
can be passed and into which it can be fixed in the desired position by three<br>
screws and nuts 213 which are spaced uniformly around the periphery of<br>
the opening 212. The rod-shaped light can therefore be fitted into the<br>
 <br>
9<br>
sleeve 17, oriented in the desired fashion and finally fixed in position by<br>
means of those three screws 213.<br>
	Figure 6 shows the rod-shaped light 10 itself as a side view (Figure<br>
6A), a front view (Figure 6B) and a rear view (Figure 6C). The rod-shaped<br>
light 10 is made overall from metal. Provided in its outer end 16B is a light<br>
emission opening 101, behind which the lighting means 14 are disposed so<br>
that they can emit light into the surrounding area 9. The rod-shaped light<br>
10 also has a peripherally extending ring 102 (abutment ring) which exactly<br>
defines how far the light 10 can be pushed into the sleeve 17. That<br>
therefore positively determines the amount by which the light then<br>
protrudes from the pylon. It is also possible to see a small step 103 at the<br>
end 10A of the rod-shaped light 10, which faces into the interior of the<br>
pylon. That step is for example in the form of a square which can be clearly<br>
seen in the rear view in Figure 6B.<br>
	As soon as the rod-shaped light 10 is inserted into, the sleeve 17 its<br>
horizontal orientation is already established by the configuration of the<br>
sleeve 17. Adaptation of the orientation can and then must still be effected<br>
around the longitudinal axis of the rod-shaped light 10 so that the light<br>
emission opening at the other end of the rod-shaped light is oriented<br>
precisely horizontally. For that purpose for example a spirit level can be<br>
applied to the square 103 and thus the correct orientation can be found. As<br>
soon as that orientation has been established the rod-shaped light 10 is<br>
fixed by means of the pipe clamp 21 (see Figure 5B) and is thus in its<br>
correct installation and operating position.<br>
	The rod-shaped light is shown in Figure 7 in the installed condition.<br>
Shown therein, in the cross-section of Figure 7A, is the way in which the<br>
rod-shaped light 10 is fitted into the sleeve 17. It is also possible to see a<br>
ring seal 22 which is disposed between the abutment ring 102 and the<br>
outer plate 19. When the rod-shaped light 10 is removed, a new seal 22 is<br>
then always used when re-fitting it or when installing a new rod-shaped<br>
light 10, so that this always guarantees a sealing fit for the rod-shaped light<br>
10 in the sleeve 17 and moisture cannot penetrate in that way into the<br>
sleeve 17 and thus into the wind power installation. Figures 7B and 7C each<br>
 <br>
10<br>
show plan views of the rod-shaped light 10 in the installed condition from<br>
the inside (Figure 7B) and from the outside (Figure 7C) respectively.<br>
	Regarding the dimensions it is also to be noted that preferably the<br>
outside diameter of the abutment ring 102 substantially corresponds to the<br>
outside diameter of the sleeve 17.<br>
	In regard to the rod-shaped light itself it is also to be noted that<br>
three variants can be envisaged. In the first variant no electronics are<br>
contained in the rod-shaped light 10 itself. That provides that the rod-<br>
shaped light is of a very simple structure. It will be noted however that the<br>
feed lines must be provided in a correspondingly complicated and expensive<br>
fashion, precisely if the supply for the individual lighting means is to be as<br>
fail-safe and independent of each other as possible and if a return line, for<br>
example for a photoresistor, is even to be provided, in order to permit<br>
functional monitoring.<br>
	In a further variant of the rod-shaped light electronics are provided<br>
in the rod-shaped light itself. In that case a distinction can again be made<br>
between an embodiment in which the electronics actuate the lighting means<br>
in dependence on trigger signals which in turn are generated by a central<br>
control, and a variant in which complete actuation is provided outside the<br>
rod-shaped light and the electronics contained in the rod-shaped light<br>
essentially perform driver functions for the lighting means.<br>
	In accordance with the invention essentially all embodiments of the<br>
rod-shaped light involve the following assembly method:<br>
	1. In a first step the sleeve 17 with the plates 18, 19 fixed thereto is<br>
also concreted in position during production of the precast concrete<br>
members. It will be appreciated that this is not required when dealing with<br>
steel pylons. There a suitable bore in the pylon is sufficient, into which the<br>
sleeve 17 can be fitted. It is to be appreciated in that respect that it is to be<br>
noted that the steel pylon possibly has to be reinforced around the bore in<br>
order to ensure that the loads involved are securely carried as otherwise<br>
the steel pylon would be weakened by the bore or bores.<br>
	2. During erection of the pylon the ramming protection 20 is fitted in<br>
a second step.<br>
 <br>
11<br>
	3. After erection of the pylon the sealing ring 22 is fitted on to the<br>
front part of the rod-shaped light 10 at the abutment ring 102.<br>
	4. In the next step the light 10 is inserted into the sleeve 17.<br>
	5. Thereafter the pipe clamp 21 is fitted on, from the interior 7 of the<br>
pylon.<br>
	6. The light 10 is oriented by means of a spirit level, and<br>
	7. the position established in that way for the rod-shaped light 10 is<br>
fixed with the pipe clamp 21.<br>
	8. The rod-shaped light then also has to be connected and can then<br>
be set in operation.<br>
	In order to be able to reach the rod-shaped light according to the<br>
invention from the interior of the pylon, which in fact is precisely to be<br>
attained by the invention so that access does not have to be from the<br>
exterior which involves a high level of complication and expenditure such as<br>
for example with a crane or a lifting platform, in a preferred configuration<br>
disposed in the interior of the pylon at a predetermined spacing beneath<br>
the rod-shaped light are catwalk rings 23 (see Figure 8, left-hand half and<br>
Figure 9A) or grating grids 24 (see Figure 8, right-hand half and Figure 9B)<br>
as well as an additional safety ring 25. The catwalk rings 23 can be reached<br>
by way of the ladders which are to be found in any wind power installation<br>
and are so installed that the rod-shaped light 10 is approximately at chest<br>
height of the engineer who is standing on the catwalk rings 23.<br>
	Figure 9A is a view in cross-section of a part of the pylon wall,<br>
showing an installed rod-shaped light 10 and the ramming protection 20.<br>
Firstly, provided beneath the rod-shaped light 10 is a safety ring 25 which<br>
extends around the pylon at the inside periphery thereof. It will be<br>
appreciated that it can be interrupted for example in the region of the<br>
ladder. That safety ring is fixed to the pylon wall 11 by means of first<br>
(short) brackets 26. Disposed beneath the safety ring 25 are second<br>
brackets 27, on which catwalk rings 23 are fixed in the design configuration<br>
shown in Figure 9A. Those catwalk rings can again extend around the pylon<br>
on the inside thereof and are so spaced that an engineer can safely stand<br>
thereon. The number (three in the configuration shown in Figure 9A) is<br>
 <br>
12<br>
selected purely randomly. It will be appreciated that there can also be four,<br>
five or more catwalk rings.<br>
	The embodiment shown in Figure 9B, instead of the catwalk rings 23,<br>
has a grating grid 24. That grating grid 24 can be segmented and can be<br>
provided in place of the catwalk rings 23 on the second brackets 27 as a<br>
catwalk surface for reaching the rod-shaped light 10.<br>
	In the plan view shown Figure 8, rod-shaped lights 10 are provided<br>
in the pylon wall 11 each spaced through 90º. The safety ring 25 is fixed to<br>
the pylon wall 11 by means of the first brackets 26 in concentric<br>
relationship with the pylon wall and extends once around the pylon in the<br>
interior thereof. The ladder has been omitted here for reasons of<br>
simplification.<br>
	The catwalk surface which is fixed to the pylon wall 11 by means of<br>
the second brackets 27 is here shown in the left-hand half of the pylon in<br>
the form of catwalk rings 23 while provided in the right-hand half are<br>
grating grid segments 24 which by virtue of their-configuration supplement <br>
each other to constitute a circle or a circular ring. In an individual case it is<br>
possible to provide catwalk rings or grating grids which then appropriately<br>
extend completely around the pylon.<br>
