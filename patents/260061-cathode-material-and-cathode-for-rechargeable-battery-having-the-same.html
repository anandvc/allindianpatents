This invention relates to a cathode material for<br>
manufacturing a rechargeable battery, more particularly<br>
to a cathode material for manufacturing a rechargeable<br>
battery which includes crystalline nanometer-sized primary<br>
particles and micrometer-sized secondary particles, each<br>
of the micrometer-sized secondary particles being composed<br>
of the crystalline nanometer-sized primary particles. This<br>
invention also relates to a cathode for a rechargeable<br>
battery including the cathode material.<br>
Along with diversified development of electronic<br>
products, there is increasing need for portable power<br>
supplies. For example, electronic consumer products,<br>
medical devices, motorcycles, automobiles, and power tools<br>
and the like require a portable power supply for power source .<br>
For current portable power supplies, rechargeable batteries<br>
are relatively popular. Since lithium rechargeable<br>
batteries have a high ratio of volume to capacity,<br>
pollution-free and recyclable charge/discharge properties,<br>
and no memory effect, they have a great development potential<br>
in the future.<br>
Additionally, a cathode material used for manufacture<br>
of the cathode plays an important role in the performance<br>
of the rechargeable battery. Among the known cathode<br>
materials, since lithium ferrous phosphate compounds and<br>
the related compounds having similar properties to LiFePO4<br><br>
compounds, such as LiMPO4, in which M represents transition<br>
elements, e.g., manganese (Mn), cobalt (Co), and nickel<br>
(Ni), are environmentally benign, relatively stable and<br>
abundant, and have relatively good electrochemical<br>
properties, e.g., high specific capacity, good<br>
charge/discharge cycling performance, and good<br>
thermostability, they have been evaluated to be the cathode<br>
material with greatest development potential.<br>
However, at present, there is a difference between<br>
practical and theoretical electrochemical properties of<br>
known LiFePO4 compounds and the related compounds. For<br>
example, the theoretical specific capacity of LiFePO4<br>
compounds and the related compounds is about 170 mAh/g,<br>
whereas the LiFePO4 compounds disclosed in the prior art<br>
have a specific capacity of about 95 mAh/g, which is far<br>
below the theoretical specific capacity. In order to improve<br>
the capacity property of the LiFePO4 compounds, it has been<br>
proposed to add other elements to the LiFePO4 compounds having<br>
one of olivine and NASICON structures so as to increase<br>
the capacity property of the LiFePO4 compounds. However,<br>
since the elements used for substituting iron are not easily<br>
available, production cost is relatively high.<br>
In addition, it has been proposed to increase the<br>
specific surface of the LiFePO4 compound powders in favor<br>
of diffusion of lithium ions in the powders, thereby<br>
enhancing capacity of a cathode material made from the LiFePO4<br>
compound powders. Particularly, the aforesaid cathode<br><br>
material is produced by sintering the LiFePO4 compound<br>
powders at a suitable temperature in such a manner that<br>
the cathode material thus formed is composed of separate<br>
single-phase crystalline particles having a grain size not<br>
larger than 10 µm. Although the capacity of the cathode<br>
material can be about 163 mAh/g, the LiFePO4 compound powders<br>
included in the cathode material have a relatively large<br>
particle size and uneven distribution. Thus, the cathode<br>
material cannot be used with aqueous binders and aqueous<br>
solvents when applied to manufacture of the cathode. Besides, since the charge/discharge rate of the battery with the<br>
proposed cathode material is about C/37, such<br>
charge/discharge rate is too low for practical application<br>
and needs to be improved.<br>
The inventor has proposed a method for making a lithium mixed metal compound, such as the lithium ferrous phosphate<br>
compounds having an olivine structure. The method includes<br>
preparing a reactant mixture that comprises ion sources<br>
of the lithium ferrous phosphate compounds, and exposing<br>
the reactant mixture to a non-oxidizing atmosphere in the<br>
presence of suspended carbon particles. The lithium ferrous<br>
phosphate compounds thus made are in powder form and have<br>
relatively small particle size and even distribution.<br>
The present invention was developed on the basis of<br>
the aforesaid method previously proposed by the inventor.<br>
The inventor of the present invention conceives a cathode<br>
material that includes crystalline nanometer-sized primary<br><br>
particles of a metal compound having one of olivine and<br>
NASICON structures, and micrometer-sized secondary<br>
particles, each of the micrometer-sized secondary particles<br>
being composed of the crystalline nanometer-sized primary<br>
particles. The inventor of the present invention found that<br>
the cathode material including micrometer-sized secondary<br>
particles, each of which is composed of crystalline<br>
nanometer-sized primary particles of a metal compound, may<br>
be produced by modifying the aforesaid method.<br>
Therefore, according to one aspect of this invention,<br>
a cathode material includes crystalline nanometer-sized<br>
primary particles of a metal compound having one of olivine<br>
and NASICON structures and a particle size ranging from<br>
10 to 500 nm, and micrometer-sized secondary particles<br>
having a particle size ranging from 1 to 50 µm. Each of<br>
the micrometer-sized secondary particles is composed of<br>
the crystalline nanometer-sized primary particles.<br>
According to another aspect of this invention, a cathode<br>
for a rechargeable battery includes an electrode plate and<br>
a coating of a cathode material coated on the electrode<br>
plate. The cathode material includes crystalline<br>
nanometer-sizedprimary particles of a metal compound having<br>
one of olivine and NASICON structures and a particle size<br>
ranging from 10 to 500 nm, and micrometer-sized secondary<br>
particles having a particle size ranging from 1 to 50 µ<br>
m. Each of the micrometer-sized secondary particles is<br>
composed of the crystalline nanometer-sized primary<br><br>
particles.<br>

S-3500V.<br>
2.	Particle size distribution analyzer: Horiba, LA-910.<br>

(Micromeritics, U.S.A.)<br><br>
Example A<br>
0.2 mole of ferric nitrate (Fe(NO3)3) was added into 200<br>
ml of deionized water. After Fe(NO3)3 was completely<br>
dissolved in the deionized water, 0.2 moles of phosphoric<br>
acid and 100 ml of 2N lithium hydroxide (LiOH) solution were<br>
added in sequence, so as to form a mixture having a<br>
stoichiometric ratio 1:1:1 of Fe3+:Li+: PO43+. 100 ml of 0.252<br>
g oxalic acid solution was added to the mixture having Fe3+,<br>
Li+, and PO43+ ions. The reactant solution thus formed was<br>
dried to form particulate precursors of LiFePO4-based metal<br>
compound.<br>
Next, the particulate precursors were placed in an<br>
aluminum oxide crucible. The crucible together with charcoal<br>
was placed in a tubular furnace which was heated at 700<br>
°C for 12 hours in the presence of an argon carrier gas flowing<br>
into the furnace. Carbon particles formed from the charcoal<br>

to form the crystalline nanometer-sized primary particles<br>
and causing sintering of contacted portions of surfaces<br>
of adjacent ones of the crystalline nanometer-sized primary<br>
particles to form each of the micrometer-sized secondary<br>
particles. A cathode material having one of olivine and<br>
NASICON structures and including micrometer-sized<br>
secondary particles having a particle size ranging from<br>
1 to 50 µm -was obtained. Particularly, each of the<br><br>

In this example, the powdered cathode material includes<br>
micrometer-sized secondary particles, each of which is<br>
composed of nanometer-sized primary particles, was prepared<br>
in a manner similar to that of Example A, except that 0.2<br>
mole of Fe (NO3) 3 was replaced with 0.2 mole of ferric chloride<br>

Example G<br>
In this example, the powdered cathode material includes<br>

of Example D, except that 0.2 mole of the iron powders were<br>
replaced with a mixture of 0.196 mole of iron powders, 0 . 002<br>
mole of magnesium chloride (MgCl2) , and 0 . 002 mole of aluminum<br>
chloride (AlCl3) . The powdered cathode material includes<br>
micrometer-sized secondary particles, each of which is<br><br>
composed of nanometer-sized primary particles of<br>
LiFe0.98Mg0.01Al0.01PO4 adhered with carbon particles. Example H<br>
In this example, the powdered cathode material includes<br>
micrometer-sized secondary particles, each of which is<br>
composed of nanometer-sized primary particles adhered with<br>
carbon particles, was prepared in a manner similar to that<br>
of Example D, except that the reactant solution was dried<br>

was then placed in the tubular furnace for conducting<br>
crystallization of the LiFePO4-based metal compound of the<br>
particulate precursors to form crystalline nanometer-sized<br>
primary particles. The tubular furnace was heated to 600<br>
°C at a rate of 5°C /min and was maintained at this temperature<br>
for 4 hours. The tubular furnace was then cooled to room<br>
temperature. The crystalline nanometer-sized primary<br>
particles were mixed with and dispersed in 2 wt% of<br>
polyvinylene alcohol solution (in a solid-to-liquid ratio<br>
of 40:60) in a ball mill for three hours of granulation<br>
process to form a slurry. The slurry was spray-dried to<br>
form micrometer-sized secondary particles. The<br>
micrometer-sized secondary_particles were then placed in<br>
the aluminum oxide crucible in which charcoal was placed.<br>
The crucible was heated at 800°C for 8 hours in the presence<br>
of a nitrogen carrier gas flowing into the furnace. Carbon<br>
particles formed from the charcoal were suspended in the<br><br>
nitrogen carrier gas and were mixed with the<br>
micrometer-sized secondary particles so as to cause<br>
sintering of contacted portions of surfaces of adjacent<br>
ones of the crystalline nanometer-sized primary particles<br>
of each of the micrometer-sized secondary particles. The<br>
furnace was then cooled to room temperature. A powdered<br>
cathode material having one of olivine and NASICON<br>
structures and including micrometer-sized secondary<br>
particles having a particle size ranging from 1 to 50 µ<br>
m was obtained. Particularly, each of the micrometer-sized<br>
secondary particles is composed of crystalline<br>
nanometer-sized primary particles of the LiFePO4-based<br>
metal compound that have a particle size ranging from 10<br>
to 500 nm and that have carbon particles adhered to surfaces<br>
thereof, and is formed by sintering of contacted portions<br>
of the surfaces of adjacent ones of the crystalline<br>
nanometer-sized primary particles.<br>
Results of Evaluation Tests<br>
Diameter analysis<br>
Figs . 1 and 2 show SEM photographs of the powdered cathode<br>
material obtained from Example D under observation using<br>
a scanning electron microscope at magnification ratios of<br>
5000 times and 10000 times, respectively. From the results<br>
shown in Figs . 1 and 2, the powdered cathode material obtained<br>
from Example D includes the micrometer-sized secondary<br>
particles having a particle size larger than 10 µm, each<br>
of which is composed of the crystalline nanometer-sized<br><br>
primary particles having a particle size ranging from 50"<br>
to 100 nm.<br>
Subsequently, 10 g of the powdered cathode material<br>
obtained from Example D was placed in the particle size<br>
distribution analyzer to evaluate particle size<br>
distribution of the micrometer-sized secondary particles.<br>
From results shown in Fig. 3, 10%, 20%, 30%, 50%, 80%, and<br>
90% of cumulative volumetric diameters of the powdered<br>
cathode material of Example D are respectively at about<br>
33.7 µm, 21.6 µm, 23.8µm, 18.3µm, 11µm and 7.0µm. From<br>
the value of 50% of cumulative volumetric diameter, it is<br>
inferred that the particles included in the cathode material<br>
are micro-scale. In addition, since only one peak is shown<br>
in the plot of Fig. 3, this indicates that particle size<br>
distribution of the micrometer-sized secondary particles<br>
of Example D is uniform.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a SEM photograph of the powdered cathode<br>
material obtained from Example H under observation using<br>
a scanning electron microscope at a magnification ratio<br>
of 5000 times. From the result shown in Fig. 4, which is<br>
similar to that of Fig. 1, the powdered cathode material<br>
obtained from Example H includes the micrometer-sized<br>
secondary particles having a particle size larger than 10<br>
µ m, each of which is composed of the crystalline<br>
nanometer-sized primary particles having a particle size<br>
ranging from 50 to 100 nm.<br>
Specific surface area analysis<br><br>
The BET (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller) specif ic surf ace area<br>
of the powdered cathode material of Example E at 77K was<br>
calculated from nitrogen isothermal absorption/ desorption<br>
curve, and has a value of 38.42 m2/g. Similarly, the value<br>
of the BET specific surface area of the powdered cathode<br>
material of Example H is about 39 m2/g. The conventional<br>
cathode material proposed in the prior art has a BET specific<br>
surface area of about 2.5 m2/g. Apparently, the cathode<br>
material of this invention has a much higher BET specific<br>
surface area.<br>
Charge/discharge test<br>
The powdered cathode material obtained from respective<br>
Examples F, G and H was evenly mixed with carbon black and<br>
polyvinylidene fluoride in a weight ratio of 83:10:7 to<br>
form a slurry mixture. The slurry mixture was then coated<br>
on an aluminum foil and was dried to produce a cathode specimen.<br>
The cathode specimen was combined with lithium metal to<br>
form a 2032 type button rechargeable battery.<br>
Charge/discharge tests were performed on the button<br>
rechargeable battery thus formed with a Maccor Series 4000<br>
AutomatedTest System (Maccor Inc. , Tulsa, Oklahoma, U.S.A.).<br>
The applied charge/discharge voltage ranged from 2.8 V to<br>
4.0V, and the charge/discharge rate was set to 0 . 2C. Results<br>
of the charge/discharge test are shown in Figs. 5, 6 and<br>
7.<br>
From the result shown in Fig. 5, the initial specific<br>
capacity of the cathode made from the powdered cathode<br><br>
material of Example F can reach 152 mAh/g, and such specific<br>
capacity can be maintained at 100% after ten<br>
charge/discharge cycles. From the result shown in Fig. 6,<br>
the initial specific capacity of the charge curve of the<br>
cathode made from the powdered cathode material of Example<br>
G can reach 167 mAh/g, which approximates the theoretical<br>
specific capacity of lithium ferrous phosphate compounds,<br>
i.e., 170 mAh/g. In addition, from the result shown in Fig.<br>
7, the specific capacity of the charge curve of the cathode<br>
made from the powdered cathode material of Example H can<br>
reach 162 mAh/g.<br>
Charege/discharge test of a whole battery<br>
The powdered cathode material obtained from Example<br>
F was mixed with different solvents and binders and then<br>
coated on electrode plates to form batteries. Each of the<br>
batteries was tested at different charge/discharge rates<br>
to evaluate the electrical property.<br>
Battery 1<br>
The powdered cathode material obtained from Example<br>
F was mixed with polyvinylidene fluoride and carbon powders<br>
in a weight ratio of 85:12:3 in N-methyl-pyrrolidone (NMP)<br>
solvent to form a mixture having a viscosity of 4000 mPa.s.<br>
Then, the mixture was coated on an aluminum electrode plate<br>
and dried at 100°C. The dried aluminum electrode plate has<br>
a thickness of 132 µm, and the powdered cathode material<br>
coated on the aluminum electrode plate was not peeled<br>
therefrom. The electrode plate was then cut and assembled<br><br>
with a carbon anode and an electrolyte solution containing<br>
1 mol/1 of LiPF6 in 5 g of ethylene carbonate/diethyl<br>
carbonate (EC/DEC) to form a prismatic battery.<br>
Charge/discharge tests were performed on the prismatic<br>
battery at various charge/discharge rates, i.e., 0.2C, 0.5C,<br>
1C, 2C, 3C and 5C, using a Maccor Series 4000 Automated<br>
Test System (Maccor Inc., Tulsa, Oklahoma, U.S.A. ) . In Fig.<br>
8, curves 1, 2, 3, 4,5 and 6 respectively correspond to<br>
voltage to capacity relationship of the battery 1 at<br>
charge/discharge rates of 0.2C, 0.5C, 1C, 2C, 3C and 5C.<br>
From the results shown in Fig. 8, it is noted that the battery<br>
1 can be efficiently charged and discharged at different<br>
charge/discharge rates. Particularly, the capacity of<br>
discharge at a charge/discharge rate of 5C is approximately<br>
87% of that of discharge at a charge/discharge rate of 0.2C.<br>
The results shown in Fig. 8 demonstrate that the powdered<br>
cathode material of this invention can be easily coated<br>
on and adhered to the electrode plate so as to achieve high<br>
charge/discharge rates.<br>
Battery 2<br>
The powdered cathode material obtained from Example<br>
F was mixed with styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR),<br>
carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), and carbon powders in a<br>
weight ratio of 95:1.5:0.5:3 in deionized water to form<br>
a mixture having a viscosity of 4000 mPa. s. Then, the mixture<br>
was coated on an aluminum electrode plate and dried at 80<br>
°C . The dried aluminum electrode plate has a thickness of<br><br>
200 µm, and the powdered cathode material coated on the<br>
aluminum electrode plate was not peeled therefrom. The<br>
electrode plate was then cut and assembled with a carbon<br>
anode and an electrolyte solution containing 1 mol/1 of<br>
LiPF6 in 5 g of ethylene carbonate/diethyl carbonate (EC/DEC)<br>
to form a 18650 battery. Charge/discharge tests were<br>
performed on the 18 650 battery at various charge/discharge<br>
rates, i.e., 0.5C, 1C, 2C, 5C and 8C, using a Maccor Series<br>
3200 Automated Test System (Maccor Inc., Tulsa, Oklahoma,<br>
U.S.A.). In Fig. 9, curves 1, 2, 3, 4,and 5 respectively<br>
correspond to voltage to capacity relationship of the<br>
battery 2 at charge/discharge rates of 0.5C, 1C, 2C, 5C,<br>
and 8C. From the results shown in Fig. 9, it is noted that<br>
the battery 2 can be efficiently charged and discharged<br>
at different charge/discharge rates. Particularly, the<br>
capacity of discharge at a charge/discharge rate of 8C is<br>
approximately 90% of that of discharge at a charge/discharge<br>
rate of 0.5C.<br>
In view of the foregoing, compared with the conventional<br>
cathode material, the cathode material of this invention,<br>
which includes micrometer-sized secondary particles having<br>
a particle size ranging from 1 to 50 µm, each of which is<br>
composed of crystalline nanometer-sized primary particles<br>
of a metal compound, has an improved specific surface area<br>
and capacity.<br>
In addition, the cathode material of this invention<br>
is compatible with various binders, particularly aqueous<br><br>
binders, and aqueous solvents, particularly deionized water,<br>
and can be easily coated on and firmly adhered to the electrode<br>
plate.<br><br>
