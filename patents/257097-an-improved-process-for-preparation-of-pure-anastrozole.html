1.	TITLE OF THE INVENTION:<br>
"An Improved Process for Preparation of Pure Anastrozole"<br>
2.	APPLICANT<br>
(a) NAME: CIPLA LTD.<br>
(b)NATIONALITY: Indian Company incorporated under the Indian Companies ACT, 1956<br>
(c) ADDRESS: 289, Bellasis Road, Mumbai Central, Mumbai - 400 008, Maharashtra, India.<br>
3. PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner<br>
in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
Field of Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an improved process for preparing pure Anastrozole. Moreover the process relates to alkylation of the isolated and purified 3,5-bis(2-cyanoprop-2-yl)benzylbromide as starting material, devoid of using toxic, hazardous and environmental unfriendly solvents.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Anastrozole is a common name of the chemically known substance 2,2'-[5-(lH-l,2,4-triazol-l-ylmethyl)-l,3-phenylene]di(2-methylpropionitrile), represented by formula (I) :<br><br>
CH3       H3C<br>
Anastrozole is a selective and potent non-steroidal drug which inhibits the action of the enzyme aromatase. It is used for the treatment of advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women with disease progression following tamoxifen therapy. Anastrozole is further recognized and granted for treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor positive or hormone receptor unknown, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer and also for adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor positive early breast cancer.<br>
The synthesis of Anastrozole is described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4935437 and RE 36617 ( a reissue of U.S. Pat. No.4935437 assigned to AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals), which are incorporated herein by reference. These patents describe two synthetic routes for preparing Anastrozole, one starting from methyl 3,5-dimethylbenzoate in a six-step process and the<br>
2<br><br>
other started from 3,5-bis(bromomethyl)toluene in a three-step process. The second process is preferable because it is much shorter and easier to perform, however both processes involve a benzylic bromination stage with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) in CCI4.<br>
In the first process, Bromination of methyl 3, 5-dimethylbenzoate with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) in CCI4 affords a 3,5-bis(bromomethyl) compound, which is subsequently treated with potassium cyanide to afford a dinitrile compound. The dinitrile compound is alkylated, then reduced to the corresponding alcohol. The alcohol is converted to an alkyl chloride intermediate, and Anastrozole is then obtained by reaction of the latter compound with sodium triazole. The final product is purified by flash column chromatography, using a repeated elution with a methanolxhloroform solvent mixture.<br>
In the second process, the starting material, 3,5-bis(bromomethyl)-toluene, is reacted with potassium cyanide in dichloromethane in the presence of a catalytic amount of tetrabutylammomum bromide (TBAB) to obtain 2,2'-(5-methyl-l,3-phenylene)diacetonitrile. The product is mixed with iodomethane and sodium hydride in DMF to thereby obtain 2,2'-(5-methyl-l,3-phenylene)di(2-methylpropionitrile), (also referred to as 3,5-bis(2-cyanoprop-2-yl)toluene) which is further brominated using benzoyl peroxide and N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) in carbon tetrachloride. The mixture is refluxed for 2 hours, cooled, filtered, and the<br>

filtrate is evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure. The residue obtained is dissolved in DMF and sodium triazole is added. After completion of the reaction, anastrozole is purified by flash column chromatography, eluting with ethyl acetate.<br>
Thus, the bromomethyl intermediate in the process is not isolated, but is directly converted to anastrozole in situ. As a result of using the non-isolated intermediate, an impure final product is obtained.<br>
Further, the use of chromatographic solvent such as chloroform (being a carcinogenic), use of solvent such as carbon tetrachloride (being a carcinogenic solvent) for bromination reaction and DMF for alkylation reaction is disadvantageous with respect to industrial application.<br>
US 20060189670 describes preparation of anastrazole by reacting 3,5 bis-(l-cyano-l methyl ethyl)benzylhalide with 4-Z-l,2,4-triazole, where in Z is a protecting group like an amine.<br>
US 2006/0035950 provide novel processes (scheme II) for purifying anastrozole, avoiding the use of liquid chromatography. The purification processes are via the isolated anastrozole salt forms, either by crystallization or by selective acidic extractions, and optionally in both cases, converting the purified anastrozole salt to anastrozole base. An improved process for the synthesis of anastrozole, which is obtained by alkylating the isolated, purified, 3,5-bis(2-cyanoprop-2-yl)benzylbromide is also disclosed. Scheme II:<br>

The above patent describes preparation of 3,5-bis(2-cyanoprop-2-yl)benzylbromide, which is carried out in solvent dichloromethane (yield is low), acetonitrile (yield is not reported) and purified, the yield reported in this process is low and also the number of steps involved in the synthesis of anastrozole is more resulting in lower yield.<br>
The bromination reaction as described in '950 can be carried out in solvent selected from the group of ethyl acetate, acetone, dichloromethane, methyl acetate, isopropyl acetate, isopropyl acetoacetate, tert-butyl acetate and acetonitrile. However, it was found that in the presence of some solvents, the purity of the product was not high. The impurity 3,5-bis(cyanoprop-2-yl)benzal bromide, a compound of formula (IV) formed during the reaction was found to an extent of 15-20% and also other problems encountered using some of these solvents are susceptible to bromination.<br>
The reaction described in this patent process was followed by reflux for 4-5 hours. The inventors<br>
5<br><br>
.CHBr2<br>
H3C ^^\^~^rCCH3 IV<br>
have found that longer reaction times cause increased levels of the impurity 3,5-bis(cyanoprop-2- yl)benzalbromide. Thus the process described for bromination in US2006/0035950 is not an efficient process to produce the product in high yield.<br>
Because of the difficulties encountered in the process disclosed in the prior arts like using carbon tetrachloride (CCU) and DMF on industrial scale and the lower yields, it would be highly desirable to develop a process for preparing anastrozole, devoid of using carcinogenic solvents like carbon tetrachloride and DMF.<br>
Anastrozole is administered in lmg dosage, it is a very expensive product and there is a constant need for developing new process, which provides good yield with high purity, making the process commercially viable. The process of the present invention is an inventive effort to provide Anastrozole in good yield with high purity.<br>
Object of the invention:<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide an improved process for preparation of Anastrazole with purity greater than 99.8%.<br>
