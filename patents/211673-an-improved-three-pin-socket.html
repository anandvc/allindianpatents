 IMPROVED THREE PIN S#CKEr<br><br><br>
LAXMAN JETHANAND MAKHIJA s°le Proprietor of MELTRON INDUSTRIES of UNIT N0-&gt; 246* 2ND Fl~00R, GURU GOBIND SINGH INDUSTRIAL AREA, SORE0A°N <e mumbai india indian national></e>
The following specifi£ation particularly describes the nature of the invention and <br>
 manner in which it is to be performed : -<br><br><br>
The invention relates to an improved three pin socket. More particularly the invention relates to an improved three pin socket for electrical connection with overlapping grooves.<br>
The conventional two-in-one three-pin socket that is in a market having six contacts each three for 6 Amp. and 16 Amp. plug members which are connected with a top member with matching holes having four fastening means. This type of three pin socket requires more contact materials and requires more number of groove therefore it is not cost effective. Also apart from this it requires more labour.<br>
Hence there is a need to prevent the material wastage and to provide improved three pin socket with overlapping grooves so that three contacts can serve the purpose of six contacts socket of two-in-one type.<br>
Accordingly there is provided an improved three pin socket comprising a bottom member of box type construction open at one end made from mouldable material having three contacts in triangular fashion in which two are base contacts and third is topmost central contact, wherein both base contacts made from metallic strips which are configured in to shape of numeral 8 so as to provide contacts for both 6 Amp and 16 Amp plug members and topmost central contact is common for both type of plug members; a front member to cover said bottom member, said front member having three grooves for the contacts, wherein the top groove is common but the both base grooves are having overlapping grooves of different diameter in which upper groove having smaller diameter than the bottom groove; said front member is fastened with the base member by screwing from the back of the base member. According to present invention the distance of the contacts for smaller and the bigger plug pin are according to the standard size of the plug pin available in the market. Also front member having fixing means at the top and bottom and front member is with or without flap member.<br>
Now the invention will be described with the help of drawings in the accompanying specification. Drawings contains:<br><br>
Fig. 1 is a perspective view of the front member and base member of three pin socket of prior art.<br>
Fig. 2 is a perspective view of the base member of the improved three pin socket according to present invention.<br>
Fig. 3 is a perspective view of the front member of the improved three pin socket according to present invention.<br>
Fig. 4 is a perspective view of base member with three contacts for wiring.<br>
Referring the Figures 1 of the accompanying drawing which illustrates the front and back view of the three pin socket of the prior art. In the prior art socket separate grooves are made for three pin of 6 Amp. and 16 Amp. As shown in Figure 1 thereby number of grooves cutting has been increased which requires more labour and thereby this is not a cost effective. The brass pieces are shown at the back of the socket wherein the live and neutral points are shown along with a top most sockets for earthling.<br>
Referring to Figures 2 to 4; an improve three pin socket (1), comprising a base member (2), of box type construction open at one end having three contacts (3), (4), (5). In these contacts two contacts (4) and (5) are base contacts while contact (3) is topmost central contact. Both base contacts are configured into shape of numeral 8 to provide contacts for both 6 Amp and 16 Amp plug members and topmost central contact is common for both type of plug members. These contacts are connected with wiring at the back. Three pin socket also consist of a front member (6), having matching holes which is fastened with the base member by screwing from the back of the base member. Front member of larger size having fastening members (7) at the top and bottom, for fixing the socket with the panel at top and bottom. The front member having three grooves for the contacts, wherein the top groove is common but the both base grooves are having overlapping grooves of different diameter in which upper groove having smaller diameter than the<br><br>
bottom groove The front member may be a mono colour or of different colours with or without flap members.<br>
This is an embodiment of the invention while several modifications are possible which may be considered within the ambit and spirit of these invention since many modification, variations and changes in details may be made to the above described embodiments. It is intended that all the matter described in the forgoing description as described in the accompanying specifications.<br><br>
I CLAIM:<br>
1.	An improved three pin socket comprising:<br>
a bottom member of box type construction open at one end made from mouldable material having three contacts in triangular fashion in which two are base contacts and third is topmost central contact, wherein both base contacts made from metallic strips which are configured in to shape of numeral 8 so as to provide contacts for both 6 Amp and 16 Amp plug members and topmost central contact is common for both type of plug members;<br>
a front member to cover said bottom member, said front member having three grooves for the contacts, wherein the top groove is common but the both base grooves are having overlapping grooves of different diameter in which upper groove having smaller diameter than the bottom groove; said front member is fastened with the base member by screwing from the back of the base member.<br>
2.	An improved three pin socket as claimed in claim 1 wherein the distance of the contacts for smaller and the bigger plug pin are according to the standard size of the plug pin available in the market.<br>
3.	An improved three pin socket as claimed in claim 1 wherein said front member having fixing means at the top and bottom and said front member is with or without flap member.<br>
