BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to an efficient three-step process for the preparation of 7-alkyl-10-hydroxy-20 (S)-camptothecin from the readily available natural product, 20 (S)-camptothecin. The invention also demonstrates a novel intermediate useful in this synthesis.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
Camptothecin derivatives have shown significant cytotoxic activity and several have been developed into useful pharmaceuticals. Specifically Irinotecan (Campto) has shown excellent activity toward colon-rectal cancers and is widely marketed. It shows considerable advantage over other camptothecin derivatives in that it is water soluble.<br>
Irinotecan is prepared in several steps from the key intermediate, 7-ethyl-10-hydroxy-20(S)-camptothecin. Considerable effort has been expended to introduce both the 10-hydroxy and the 7-ethyl functionality into the camptothecin molecule. Therefore, while there is some prior art associated with each of these individual groups, there is very little knowledge on introduction of both these functionality simultaneously into the molecule.<br>
Sawada (Chem. Pharma. Bull., 39(12), 3183(1991) demonstrates the synthesis of 7-ethyl-l0-hydroxy-20 (S)~ camptothecin through the synthesis of 7-ethyl-20 (S)-camptothecin by known means, the subsequent formation of an  N-oxide  and  the  photochemical  rearrangement  to<br><br>
provide 7-e thyl-10-hydroxy-20(S)-camptothecin. However,<br>
this synthesis suffers considerably from the<br>
insolubility of 7-ethyl-20(S)-camptothecin in suitable<br>
solvents and thus only small quantities can be prepared.	<br>
10-Hydroxy-20(S)-camptothecin has been prepared by the hydrogenation of 20(S)-camptothecin to 1,2,6,7-tetrahydro-20(S)-camptothecin and subsequent oxidation. Thus US Pat. 5,734,056 describes the preparation through the hydrogenation of 20(S)-camptothecin to 1,2,6,7-tetrahydro-20(S)-camptothecin followed by the oxidation with iodosobenzene derivatives specifically esters such as iodobenzenediacetate. Japanese pat. No. 59-5188 discloses the hydrogenation of camptothecin followed by oxidation with agents such as CAN(cerium (IV) ammonium  nitrate, chromic acid, potassium permanganate, Fremy's salt. Similarly, Sawada, et. al. (Chem.Pharm. Bull. 39(120)3183, 1991) describes a reduction and oxidation with lead tetraacetate. In all these cases, the use of a 7-substituted derivative has not been demonstrated.<br>
The preparation of 7-ethyl-20(S)-camptothecin has been demonstrated previously through the Fenton reaction by employing 20 (S)-camptothecin and propionaldehyde with ferrous sulfate and sulfuric acid.<br>
Therefore there is a need for an efficient synthesis of 7-ethyl-10-hydroxy-20(S)-camptothecin which can be used in commercial scale.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides as one<br>
embodiment a novel process employing the formation of<br>
the 7-ethyl-20(S)-camptothecin followed by the catalytic	<br>
reduction and subsequent oxidation to the desired 7-<br><br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENTLY PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The formation of 7-alkyl-20(S)-camptothecin (I) was accomplished by known methodology. It is known in the literature that the hydrogenation of tetra-substituted olefins is very difficult. Therefore, it was expected that the hydrogenation of this compound to 7-alkyl-1,2,6,7 - tetrahydro-20(S)-camptothecin (II) would be challenging. We were surprised to learn that we could indeed accomplish this hydrogenation in good yield and good purity using Pt02 as the catalyst in a suitable solvent in which the 7-alkyl-20(S)-camptothecin is soluble. Catalysts other than Pt02 may be used, such as reduction catalyst containing at least one of the elements platinum,/ rhodium, lawrencium, and ruthenium. Further, the hydrogenation step may be conducted with a<br><br>
catalysis modifier, such as dimethylsulfoxide and ammonium hydroxide. Acetic acid is a preferred solvent for this purpose. Other solvent systems such as alcohols and mixtures of acetic acid and alcohols can be employed in this hydrogenation but high solubility of camptothecin in acetic acid makes acetic acid the most desirable solvent. By employing this catalytic hydrogenation, the desired product can be easily obtained in greater than 90% yield.<br>
It was found that unlike the known 1,2,6,7-<br>
tetrahydro-20(S)-camptothecin, 7-alkyl-l,2,6,7<br>
tetrahydro-20(S)-camptothecin (II) is oxidized readily<br>
back to 7-alkyl-20(S)-camptothecin (I) under an oxygen<br>
atmosphere. Therefore there was a question as to whether<br>
the oxidation would produce the 10-hydroxy derivative in<br>
good    yield.    In    fact,	the    oxidation    with<br>
iodobenzenediacetate in acetic  acid/water did produce the desired 7-alkyl-10-hydroxy-20(S)-camptothecin  (III) in very good yield. The reaction can be carried out in a variety of solvent systems but again acetic acid/water was the most convenient and preferred solvent system. Other suitable solvents include C1-C6 ester, Ci~C6 acid, Cj-Cg alcohol and water.    More specifically, the Ci-C6 acid may be butenic acid,  propanoic acid and acetic acid.  The reaction may also be carried out with various other  oxidizing  agents,  including  those  containing ] hypervalent iodine,  ruthenium  (VIII), manganate  (VII), \ osmium (VIII), lead (IV) and chromium (VI). The product | precipitates during the reaction and can be collected byj filtration. The product obtained is of sufficient purity to  be  used  directly  or  it  can  be  purified  by<br><br>
recrystallization from organic solvents such as acetic acid.<br>
Therefore the present invention provides for an efficient synthesis of 7-alkyl-10-hydroxy-20 (S) -camptothecin (III).<br>
Examples<br>
Preparation of 7-ethyl-20(S)-camptothecin (I)<br>
20(S)-camptothecin (60.0 g), ferrous sulfate heptahydrate (12.0 g) and 9N sulfuric acid (1200 ml) are subsequently charged to a 5-L reactor equipped with a mechanical stirrer, condenser and a thermometer under nitrogen atmosphere. The resulting mixture is stirred at 25 °C until all the suspension is dissolved, and it is cooled to between -10 and 0 °C. Propionyl aldehyde (10.0 g) is added to the cold reaction mixture. A solution of 10% hydrogen peroxide (116.9 g) and propionyl aldehyde (15.0 g) are simultaneously charged to the cold reaction mixture over a period of 30-60 minutes, while maintaining the temperature at 10 to 0 °C. The resulting mixture is stirred at the same temperature for 60 to 90 minutes. The reaction mixture was diluted with water and neutralized with aqueous ammonium hydroxide to precipitate out the desired product. The crude product was crystallized from acetic acid and water to give compound I, 49.83 g in 71.6% yield with purity of 95.16% by HPLC. 1H-NMR (DMSO-d6) 5: 0.9 (3H, t), 1.3 (3H, t) , 1.85 (2H, q), 3.2 (2H, q) , 5.28 (2H, s) , 5.44 (2H, s), 6.5 (1H, s), 7.32 (1H, s), 7.7 (1H, dd), 7.85 (1H, dd), 8.15 (1H, d), 8.26 (1H, d).<br><br>
Preparation     of     7-ethyl-l,2,6,7-tetrahydro-20(S) -camptothecin (II)<br>
7-ethyl-20(S)-camptothecin (I) (30.0 g) and acetic acid (900 ml) were charged together and heated to 80 °C to facilitate the dissolution. The resulting solution is then transferred to a 2-L autoclave reactor and cooled to room temperature. Ammonium hydroxide (30% contents, 3.4 ml), platinum oxide and dimethyl sulfoxide (2.2 ml) were added into the resulting suspension at 25 °C. The resulting mixture is then subjected to hydrogenation at a hydrogen pressure of 5 bars until the starting material, 7-ethyl-20(S)-camptothecin I, disappeared by TLC analysis. The catalyst was removed by filtering through a pad of celite and washed with acetic acid, the resulting solution is used directly for the ■ next reaction. The sample was characterized by HPLC, NMR, IR and LC/MS analysis. HPLC shows three diastereoisomers in a ratio of 6: 61: 13, which are detected by LC/MS to have MS m/z: 380 (M+) . 1H-NMR (DMSO-d6) 5: 0.78 (3H, t), 0.82 (3H, m) , 1.2-1.35 (2H, m) , 1.8 (3H, m) , 2.65 (1H, m) , 3.12 (1H, m) , 3.75 (1H, dd) , 4.08 (1H, dd) , 4.92 (1H, dd), 5.23 (1H, s), 6.48 (1H, s), 6.5-6.98 (4H, m) , 6.62 (1H, s); IR (KBr) v: 3310, 2967, 1744, 1652, 1586, 1491, 1465 cm-1.<br>
Preparation   of   7-ethyl-10-hydroxy-20(S)-camptothecin<br>
(III)<br>
The hydrogenated filtrate of 7-ethyl-l,2, 6,7-tetrahydro-20(S)-camptothecin was charged to a 3-L, four-necked round bottom flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, thermometer under nitrogen atmosphere, and was cooled to 10° C. Water ( 900 ml) was<br><br>
added to the solution and the resulting solution was stirred at this temperature for 20 minutes. Subsequently, iodobenzene diacetate (65.5 g) was added to the solution in several small portions, while maintaining the temperature below 10° C. The resulting mixture was stirred at this temperature until the complete disappearance of the starting material, 7-ethyl-1,2,6,7-tetrahydro-20(S)-camptothecin (II), as monitored by TLC. The reaction was quenched by the addition of Methanol (230 ml) to facilitate the precipitation of the product. The reaction slurry was then filtered and the collected solids are washed with aqueous acetic acid and methanol to give the desired product 28.3 g (90% overall yield in two steps) . 1H-NMR (DMSO-d6) 5: 0.9 (3H, t) , 1.32 (3H, t), 1.88 (2H, q), 3.1 (2H, q), 5.28 (1H, s), 5.42 (1H, s), 6.46 (1H, s), 7.28 (1H, s), 7.4 (2H, m), 8.0 (1H, d), 10.5 (1H, s).<br>
