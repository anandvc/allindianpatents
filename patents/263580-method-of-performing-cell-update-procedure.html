Description<br>
Technical Field<br>
The invention relates to a method for settling a dysfunction in a radio link es-<br>
tablished between a user equipment and a cellular network. The invention applies in<br>
particular to UMTS type networks.<br>
Background Art<br>
A universal mobile telecommunication system (UMTS) is a European-type, third<br>
generation IMT-2000 mobile communication system that has evolved from a European<br>
standard known as Global System for Mobile communications (GSM).<br>
UMTS is intended to provide an improved mobile communication service based<br>
upon a GSM core network and wideband code division multiple access (W-CDMA)<br>
wireless connection technology. In December 1998, a Third Generation Partnership<br>
Project (3GPP) was formed by the ETSI of Europe, the ARTB/TTC of Japan, the T1 of<br>
the United States, and the TTA of Korea. The 3GPP creates detailed specifications of<br>
UMTS technology. In order to achieve rapid and efficient technical development of the<br>
UMTS, five technical specification groups (TSG) have been created within the 3GPP<br>
for standardizing the UMTS by considering the independent nature of the network<br>
elements and their operations. Each TSG develops, approves, and manages the<br>
standard specification within a related region. Among these groups, the radio access<br>
network (RAN) group (TSG-RAN) develops the standards for the functions, re-<br>
quirements, and interface of the UMTS terrestrial radio access network (UTRAN),<br>
which is a new radio, access network for supporting W-CDMA access technology in<br>
the UMTS.<br>
Figure 1 gives an overview of a UMTS network, including a user equipment (UE),<br>
such as a mobile station, a UMTS terrestrial radio access network (UTRAN) and a core<br>
network (CN).<br>
The UTRAN is composed of several Radio Network Controllers (RNCs) and<br>
NodeBs which are connected via an Iub interface. Each RNC controls several NodeBs.<br>
Each NodeB controls one or several cells, where a cell is characterised by the fact that<br>
it covers a given geographical area on a given frequency. Each RNC is connected via<br>
an Iu interface to the CN, i.e. towards a Mobile-services Switching Centre entity<br>
(MSC) of the CN and a Serving GPRS Support Node entity (SGSN). RNCs can be<br>
connected to other RNCs via the Iur interface. The RNC handles the assignment and<br>
management of radio resources and operates as an access point with respect to the CN.<br>
The NodeBs receive information sent by the physical layer of the UE through an<br><br>
uplink and transmil data lo the UE through a downlink. The Node-Bs operate as access<br>
points of the UTRAN for the UE. The GPRS support node (SGSN) is connected via a<br>
Gf interface to an Equipment Identity Register (EIR), via a GS interface to the MSC,<br>
via a GN interface to the Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) and via the GR<br>
interlace to the Home Subscriber Server (HSS). The EIR hosts lists of mobiles which<br>
are allowed or are not allowed to be used on the network. The MSC which controls the<br>
connection for Circuit Switched (CS) services is connected via an NB interface<br>
towards the 'Media Gateway (MGW), via a F interface towards the EIR, and via a D<br>
interface towards the Home Subscriber Server (HSS). The MGW is connected via a C<br>
interface towards the HSS, and to the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN),<br>
and allows to adapt the codecs between the PSTN and the connected Radio Access<br>
Network (RAN).<br>
[7]	The GGSN is connected via a GC interface to the HSS, and via a GI interface to the<br>
Internet. The GGSN is responsible for routing, charging and separation of data flows<br>
into different Radio Access Bearers (RABs). The HSS handles the subscription data of<br>
the users.<br>
[8]	Other connections exist that are not important for the current invention.<br>
[9]	. The UTRAN constructs and maintains a radio access bearer (RAB) for com-<br>
munication between the UE and the CN. The CN requests end-to-end quality of service<br>
(QoS) requirements from the RAB, and the RAB supports the QoS requirements the<br>
core network has set. Accordingly, by constructing and maintaining the RAB, the<br>
UTRAN can satisfy the end-to-end QoS requirements.<br>
[10]	The services provided to a specific UE are roughly divided into the circuit switched<br>
(CS) services and the packet switched (PS) services. For example, a general voice con-<br>
versation service is a circuit switched service, while a Web browsing service via an<br>
Internet connection is classified as a packet switched (PS) service.<br>
[11]	For supporting circuit switched services, the RNCs are connected to the mobile<br>
switching center (MSC) of the core network (CN) and the MSC is connected to the<br>
Gateway Mobile Switching Center (GMSC) that manages the connection with other<br>
networks. For supporting packet switched services, the RNCs are connected to the<br>
serving general packet radio service (GPRS) support node (SGSN) and the gateway<br>
GPRS support node (GGSN) of the core network. The SGSN supports the packet com-<br>
munications with the RNCs and the GGSN manages the connection with other packet<br>
switched networks, such as the Internet.<br>
[12]	Figure 2 illustrates a structure of a radio interface protocol between the UE and the<br>
UTRAN according to the 3GPP radio access network standards. As shown in Figure 2,<br>
the radio interface protocol has horizontal layers comprising a physical layer, a data<br>
link layer, and a network layer, and has vertical planes comprising a user plane<br><br>
(U-plane) for transmitting user data and a control plane (C-plane) for transmitting .<br>
control information. The user plane is a region that handles traffic information with the<br>
user, such as voice or Internet protocol (IP) packets. The control plane is a region that<br>
handles control information for an interface with a network, maintenance and<br>
management of a call, and the like. The protocol layers in Figure 2 can be divided into<br>
a first layer (L1), a second layer (L2), and a third layer (L3) based on the three lower<br>
layers of an Open System Interconnection (OSI) standard model. The first layer (L1),<br>
namely, the physical layer, provides an information transfer service to an upper layer<br>
by using various radio transmission techniques. The physical layer is connected to an<br>
upper layer called a Medium Access Control (MAC) layer, via a transport channel.<br>
[13]	The MAC layer and the physical layer exchange data via the transport channel. The<br>
second layer (L2) includes a MAC layer,, a Radio Link Control (RLC) layer, a<br>
Broadcast/Multicast control (BMC) layer, and a Packet Data Convergence Protocol<br>
(PDCP) layer. The MAC layer handles mapping between logical channels and<br>
transport channels and provides allocation of the MAC parameters for allocation and<br>
re-allocation of radio resources. The MAC layer is connected to an upper layer called<br>
the Radio Link Control (RLC) layer, via a logical channel.<br>
[14]	Various logical channels are provided according to the type of information<br>
transmitted. In general, a control channel is used to transmit information of the control<br>
plane and a traffic channel is used to transmit information of the user plane. A logical<br>
channel may be a common channel or a dedicated channel depending on whether the<br>
logical channel is shared. Logical channels include a Dedicated Traffic CHannel<br>
(DTCH), a Dedicated Control CHannel (DCCH), a Common Traffic CHannel<br>
(CTCH), a Common Control CHannel (CCCH), a Broadcast Control CHannel<br>
(BCCH), and a Paging Control CHannel (PCCH), or a Shared Control Channel.<br>
(SCCH) and other channels. The BCCH provides information including information<br>
utilized by a UE to access a system. The PCCH is used by the UTRAN to access a UE.<br>
[15]	For the purposes of MB MS (multimedia broadcast/multicast service; or other types<br>
of point-to-multipoint services), additional traffic and control channels are introduced<br>
in the MBMS standard. The MB MS point-to-multipoint Control Channel (MCCH) is<br>
used for transmission of MBMS control information, the MBMS point-to-multipoint<br>
Traffic Channel (MTCH) is used for transmitting MBMS service data. The MBMS<br>
Scheduling Channel (MSCH) is used to transmit scheduling information. The different<br>
logical channels that exist are listed below:<br>
[16]<br><br>
Control Channel (CCH)	 Broadcast Control Channel<br>
	 Paging Control Channel<br>
	 Dedicated Control Channel<br>
	 Common Control Channel<br>
	 Shared Channel Control Channel (SHCCH)<br>
	 MBMS point-to-multipoint Control Channel (MCCH)<br>
	 MBMS Scheduling Channel (MSCH).<br>
Traffic Channel (TCH) -—	 Dedicated Traffic Channel<br>
	 Common Traffic Channel (CTCH)<br>
	 MBMS point-to-multipoint Traffic Channel (MTCH)<br>
[17]	The MAC layer is connected to the physical layer by transport channels and can be<br>
divided into a MAC-b sub-layer, a MAC-d sub-layer, a MAC-c/sh sub-layer, a MAC-<br>
hs sub-layer and a MAC-m sublayer according to the type, of transport channel being<br>
managed. The MAC-b sub-layer manages a BCH (Broadcast Channel), which is a<br>
transport channel handling the broadcasting of system information. The MAC-c/sh<br>
sub-layer manages a common transport channel, such as a forward access channel<br>
(FACH) or a downlink shared channel (DSCH), which is shared by a plurality of UEs,<br>
or in the uplink the Radio Access Channel (RACH). The MAC-m sublayer may handle<br>
the MBMS data.<br>
[18]	The possible mapping between the logical channels and the transport channels from<br>
a UE perspective is given in Figure 3.<br>
[19]	The possible mapping between the logical channels and the transport channels from<br>
a UTRAN perspective is given in Figure 4.<br>
[20]	The MAC-d sub-layer manages a dedicated channel (DCH), which is a dedicated<br>
transport channel for a specific terminal. The MAC-d sublayer is located in a serving<br>
RNC (SRNC) that manages a corresponding user equipment, and one MAC-d sublayer<br>
also exists in each terminal. The RLC layer, depending of the RLC mode of operation<br>
supports reliable data transmissions and performs segmentation and concatenation on a<br>
plurality of RLC service data units (SDUs) delivered from an upper layer. When the<br>
RLC layer receives the RLC SDUs from the upper layer, the RLC layer adjusts the size<br>
of each RLC SDU in an appropriate manner based upon processing capacity and then<br>
creates data units by adding header information thereto. The data units, called protocol<br>
data units (PDUs), are transferred to the MAC layer via a logical channel. The RLC<br>
layer includes a RLC buffer for storing the RLC SDUs and/or the RLC PDUs.<br>
[21]	The BMC layer schedules a cell broadcast (CB) message transferred from the core<br>
network and broadcasts the CB message to terminals positioned in a specific cell or<br>
cells.<br><br>
[22]	The PDCP layer is located above the RLC layer. The PDCP layer is used to<br>
transmit network protocol data, such as the IPv4 or IPv6, efficiently on a radio<br>
interface with a relatively small bandwidth. For this purpose, the PDCP layer reduces<br>
unnecessary control information used in a wired network, a function called header<br>
compression.<br>
[23]	The radio resource control (RRC) layer located at the lowest portion of the third<br>
layer (L3) is only defined in the control plane. The RRC layer controls the transport<br>
channels and the physical channels in relation to setup, reconfiguration, and the release<br>
or cancellation of the radio bearers (RBs). The RB signifies a service provided by the<br>
second layer (L2) for data transmission between the terminal and the UTRAN. In<br>
general, the set up of the RB refers to the process of stipulating the characteristics of a<br>
protocol layer and a channel required for providing a specific data service, and setting<br>
the respective detailed parameters and operation methods. Additionally the RRC<br>
handles user mobility within the RAN, and additional services, e.g. location services.<br>
[24]	The different possibilities that exist for the mapping between the radio bearers and<br>
the transport channels for a given UE are not all possible all the time. The UE /<br>
UTRAN deduce the possible mapping depending on the UE state and the procedure<br>
that the UE / UTRAN is executing. The different states and modes are explained in<br>
more detail below, as far as they concern the present invention.<br>
[25]	The different transport channels are mapped onto different physical channels. The<br>
configuration of the physical channels is given by RRC signalling exchanged between<br>
the RNC and the UE..<br>
[26]	The DPCH channel can be established and used simultaneously between the UE<br>
and one or several cells of one or several NodeBs as shown in Figure 5. This situation<br>
where the UE has a DPCH established simultaneously to several cells is called "soft<br>
handover". The case where the UE has established a DPCH simultaneously to several<br>
cells of the same NodeB is called "softer handover". For the DPCH the UE is always<br>
combining the TPC commands from all radio links in the downlink, and uses always<br>
the command which asks for the least transmit power (i.e. in the case one radio link<br>
says "up" and the other one "down" the UE chooses to decrease the transmit power).<br>
[27]	The RLC layer (Radio Link Control) is a layer 2 protocol which is used in order to<br>
control the data exchange between the logical channels between the RNC and the UE.<br>
The RLC layer can currently be configured in 3 types of transfer modes:<br>
[28]	- Transparent mode,<br>
[29]	- Unacknowledged mode,<br>
[30]	- Acknowledged mode<br>
[31]	The detailed behaviour of these modes is described in [3]. The different func-<br>
tionalities that are available depend on the transfer mode.<br><br>
[32]	In acknowledged and unacknowledged mode, Serving Data Units (SDUs) can be<br>
split into smaller Packet Date Units (PDUs) that'are used for transmission over the air<br>
interface. The transmitter side separates the SDU into PDUs, and based on control in-<br>
formation that is added to the PDUs die receiver side re-assembles the PDUs in order<br>
to reconstruct the SDUs. Such control information is e.g. a PDU sequence number in<br>
order to detect whether a PDU has been lost, or a Length Indicator (L1) which indicates<br>
the beginning / end of a SDU inside an RLC PDU.<br>
[33]	In unacknowledged mode the receiver does not send a confirmation to the<br>
transmitter of correctly received PDUs, but the receiver side just reassembles PDUs to<br>
SDUs based on signalling information contained in the PDUs and transfers the<br>
complete SDUs to higher layers.<br>
[34]	In acknowledged mode the receiver sends acknowledgements for the correctly<br>
received PDU. The transmitter uses these acknowledgements in order to initiate re-<br>
transmissions of missing PDUs. The acknowledgements are sent in certain conditions.<br>
There are several mechanisms foreseen in order to initiate the transmission of the ac-<br>
knowledgements for PDUs received by the receiver. Which mechanisms are activated<br>
is defined in the standard and/or configured by RRC signalling. One example for such<br>
a mechanism for the transmission of a status PDU is e.g. the'reception of a PDU with a<br>
sequence number that does not correspond to the latest received sequence number<br>
increased by one, or when the receiver receives an indication from the transmitter in<br>
the RLC control information that an acknowledgment (also called "Status") should be<br>
sent. The indication of the transmitter to send a status PDU is called "Polling".<br>
[35]	When the transmitter sends a Polling bit a mechanism is defined in the UMTS<br>
standard if no Status report has been received after the transmission of the polling after<br>
a certain time. This mechanism initiates the transmitter to retransmit a PDU including<br>
the polling indicator and is called "timer poll".<br>
[36]	Another mechanism counts the number of retransmissions of a PDU. In the case the<br>
retransmission exceeds a certain number (MaxDat) the transmitter starts the reset<br>
procedure which is a procedure that allows to set the transmitter and the receiver entity<br>
of a radio bearer using AM RLC mode to an initial state. When the Reset procedure is<br>
initiated the initiating entity transmits a "Reset" PDU to the terminating entity. The<br>
terminating entity acknowledges the reception of the "Reset" PDU by transmitting the<br>
. "Reset Ack" PDU. If the initiating entity has not received the "Reset Ack" PDU after a<br>
certain, time the initiating entity retransmits the "Reset" PDU. If the initiating entity has<br>
not received an "Reset Ack" PDU after a certain amount of re-transmissions the<br>
initiating entity detects an "unrecoverable error".<br>
[37]	This disclosure describes the situation where a dysfunction is detected in the<br>
operation of a radio Link Control (RLC) entity in RLC AM mode. Other mechanisms<br><br>
to detect a dysfunction are already described in the UMTS standard, or possible to be<br>
imagined and implemented. It is also possible to imagine detection mechanisms for<br>
RLC entities in UM mode, which would e.g. detect that undefined signalling in-<br>
formation is included in the RLC PDU, or where higher layers detect that the reception<br>
/ transmission of the UM entity is not behaving correctly.<br>
[38]	As explained in the above, there are mechanisms defined in the standard that detect<br>
an "unrecoverable error", which can correspond to a blocked situation, or a situation<br>
where the communication is disturbed.<br>
[39]	As explained in the above, mere are mechanisms defined in the standard that detect<br>
an "unrecoverable error", which can correspond to a blocked situation, or a situation<br>
where the communication is disturbed.<br>
[40]	If the UE detects an "unrecoverable error" situation as described in the standard, the<br>
UE enters CELL_FACH state and sends a "Cell update" message to the NodeB/RNC<br>
eventually indicating that an unrecoverable error has occurred by setting the IE<br>
(Information Element) "Cell update cause" to the cause "RLC unrecoverable error".<br>
The UE indicates by including the IE "AM_RLC error indication (RB2, RB3 or RB4)"<br>
that this unrecoverable error has either occurred for one of the Signalling Radio<br>
Bearers with the Identities 2, 3 or 4 or by including the IE "AM_RLC error indication<br>
(RB&gt;4)" that this error has occurred for one of the Radio Bearers (RBs) using RLC<br>
AM mode with IDs higher than 4. The RNC can then send the "Cell Update Confirm"<br>
message and indicate that the RLC entities for SRBs with the IDs 2, 3 and 4, or for the<br>
RBs with Ids higher than 4 that use RLC AM mode shall be re-established by setting<br>
the IE "RLC re-establish indicator (RB2, RB3 and RB4)" and / or "RLC re-establish<br>
' indicator (RB5 and upwards)" to "true".<br>
[41]	The UM / AM RLC entity is also responsible for handling of ciphering and de-<br>
ciphering. In order to do so the RLC entity in the transmitter and the receiver maintain<br>
a COUNT-C number which is composed of a Hyper fFrame nNumber (HFN) and the<br>
RLC sequence number. The COUNT-C value, together with other information is used<br>
as input to a mathematical function that generates a bitstring. This bitstring and the<br>
RLC PDU except the SN are combined by the logical XOR operation, which ensures<br>
the ciphering of the data part of the RLC PDU. The HFN value is incremented each<br>
time the RLC SN wraps around (i.e. when the RLC SN reaches its highest value and<br>
restarts from 0). In the case the receiver misses a certain number of SNs, or in the case<br>
the received SN received has been altered during the reception it is possible that the<br>
COUNT-C in the receiver and the transmitter are desynchronized. In this case the<br>
receiver is not capable to decipher correctly the information received. The receiver can<br>
detect the dysfunction of the deciphering entity by different mechanisms which are not<br>
further described here, and which are not part of the invention.<br><br>
[42]	HS-DSCH is a transport channel which allows to transmit data in the downlink in<br>
the UMTS standard, and which allows to use high data rates. The HS-DSCH channel is<br>
always mapped to the HS-PDSCH physical channel. The HS-PDSCH contrary to the<br>
DPCH can only be transmitted to a given UE from one cell at a time. The HS-DSCH<br>
channel uses a hybrid ARQ mechanism which allows fast retransmission of data from<br>
the NodeB to the UE. This mechanism is also described in [2]. In order to know<br>
whether the UE has received a given block correctly, the UE sends acknowledgments<br>
to the NodeB which are sent on the HS-DPCCH physical channel in the uplink.as<br>
explained in [1]: In addition, on the HS-DPCCH the UE sends the CQI information<br>
which indicates the quality of the radio channel in downlink. This allows the NodeB to<br>
adapt the transport format and the scheduling on the channel conditions.<br>
[43]	As illustrated in Figure 5, during the transmission in CELL_DCH the UE performs<br>
inner loop power control i.e. the UE receives transmit power commands (TPC) from<br>
the NodeB which indicate to the UE whether it should increase the transmit power or<br>
decrease the transmit power on the DCH channels as described above. The UE<br>
combines the TPC received from the different cells. Normally this means that the UE<br>
adapts the transmit power to the best radio link in the UL. The UE increases or<br>
decreases the transmit power of the DPCCH, DPDCH and HS-DPCCH. The HS-<br>
DPCCH is only received by the cell that sends the HS-DSCH. This implies that the<br>
transmit power of the HS-DSCCH DPCCH is not always adapted to the uplink channel<br>
conditions between the UE and the HS-DSCH serving cell. This means that the HS-<br>
DSCH channel can be temporarily unavailable.<br>
[44]	One of the main advantages is that the HS-DSCH is a shared channel, which<br>
implies that the necessary spreading codes do not need to be allocated in advance and<br>
can be shared dynamically amongst different users.<br>
[45]	The RRC mode refers to whether there exists a logical connection between the RRC<br>
of the terminal and the RRC of the UTRAN. If there is a connection, the terminal is<br>
said to be in RRC connected mode. If there is no connection, the terminal is said to be<br>
in idle mode. Because an RRC connection exists for terminals in RRC connected<br>
mode, the UTRAN can determine the existence of a particular terminal within the unit<br>
of cells, for example which cell or set of cells the RRC connected mode terminal is in,<br>
and which physical channel the UE is listening to. Thus, the terminal can be effectively<br>
controlled.<br>
[46]	In contrast, the UTRAN cannot determine the existence of a terminal in idle mode.<br>
The existence of idle mode terminals can only be determined by the core network to be<br>
within a region that is larger than a cell, for example a location or a routing area.<br>
Therefore, the existence of idle mode terminals is determined within large regions,<br>
and, in order to receive mobile communication services such as voice or data, the idle<br><br>
mode terminal must moves or changes, into the RRC connected mode. The possible<br>
transitions between modes and states are shown in Figure 6.<br>
[47]	A UE in RRC connected mode can be in different states, e.g. CELL_FACH state,<br>
CELL_PCH state, CELL_DCH state or URA_PCH state. Other states could be<br>
envisaged of course. Depending on the states the UE carries out different actions and<br>
listens to different channels. For example a UE in CELL_DCH state will triesy to<br>
. listen (amongst others) to DCH type of transport channels which comprises DTCH and<br>
DCCH transport channels and which can be mapped to a certain DPCH, DPDSCH, or<br>
other physical channels. The UE in CELL_FACH state willlistens to several FACH<br>
transport channels which are mapped to a certain S-CCPCH, the UE in PCH state will<br>
listens to the PICH channel and to the PCH channel which is mapped to a certain S-<br>
CCPCH physical channel.<br>
[48]	As described above, a radio bearer carries data from layers above the L2, i.e. data<br>
generated inside the UTRAN, e.g. RRC and Non access stratum (NAS) signalling<br>
(more generally the c-plane) and user data (the u-plane). The data from the RRC<br>
signalling is today transported via 3 signalling radio bearers, which are numbered from.<br>
0 to 2. The data from NAS signalling is transmitted on the signalling radio bearer 3 and<br>
if used 4. The remaining radio bearer identifiers are available for transmitting user<br>
plane data.<br>
[49]	For efficient transport of the different radio bearers according to their Quality of<br>
Service (QoS) characteristics, the radio bearers can be mapped via a logical channel on<br>
different transport channels. The possible mapping options for the radio bearers depend<br>
on the type of traffic they carry. The dedicated signalling radio bearers 0-4 are mapped<br>
via a DCCH / CCCH type of logical channels. The dedicated radio bearers that carry<br>
user plane traffic with identities above 5 are mapped via DTCH type of logical<br>
channels. The possible mapping options are defined via RRC signalling. Different<br>
mapping options can be defined independently for uplink and downlink and depending<br>
on the UE state, and the transport channels that are available.<br>
[50]	As illustrated on Figure 7, a possible configuration for mapping options in the<br>
downlink is shown. In this example four mapping options are configured:<br>
[51]	In CELL_DCH state when HS-PDSCH and DPCH are available the SRB#1 to #4<br>
are mapped on the DPCH, and the other Radio Bearers RB#5 to #20 are mapped to the<br>
HS-PDSCH. The SRB#0 is not mapped in this case.<br>
. [52]	In CELL_DCH state when DPCH is available and HS-PDSCH is not available the<br>
Signalling Radio Bearers SRB#1 to #4 and the other RB#5 to #20 are mapped to<br>
DPCH. The SRB#0 is not mapped in this case. In CELL_DCH state when DPCH is not<br>
available and HS-PDSCH is available the SRB#1 to #4 arid the other RB#5 to #20 are<br>
mapped to HS-PDSCH. The SRB#0 is not mapped in this case.<br><br>
[53]	In CELL_FACH state SRB#Ojto #4 and the other RB#5 to #20 are mapped to<br>
FACH.	. I<br>
[54]	. In the Release 6 of UTRAN a new physical channel type is introduced which is<br>
called "fractional DPCH" and which can be used in order to replace the normal DPCH<br>
channel. This channel type reduc'es the number of spreading codes that are needed in<br>
the downlink by sharing one code between different users. In order to reduce the code<br>
i<br>
usage, no DCH transport channel can be carried by this "fractional DPCH" physical<br>
channel, although the SRBs are mapped on the HS-DSCH.<br>
[55]	In the uplink the SRBs and the user plane radio bearers are mapped on the DPCH,<br>
J<br>
or eventually on any other available channel. This allows mat the UE can transmit in<br>
die uplink.<br>
[56]	Here are two examples of situations where Radio Link Control (RLC) entity can be<br>
affected by an error which necessitates that a Radio Network Control (RNC) entity<br>
i<br>
triggers a procedure for re-initializing the Radio Link Control (RLC) entity.<br>
[57]	Exeample 1 : Degradation of} the quality of a Radio Link (HS-DSCH RL failure<br>
case)	|<br>
[58]	In the case the SRBs are mapped, on the HS-DSCH there can be problems when the<br>
HS-DSCH becomes unavailable, but the UE is still RRC connected via the remaining<br>
radio links. The HS-DSCH channel relies on the uplink / downlink communication<br>
between the NodeB and the UEjvia different channels. These channels are in the<br>
j<br>
downlink:	.	;<br>
[59]	-theHS-SCCH,	j-<br>
[60]	- the HS-PDSCH.	j __<br>
[61]	In the uplink the reception of the HS-DSCH relies on:<br>
[62]	- the HS-DPCCH.<br>
[63]	If the reception of one of these physical channels is not possible any more the<br>
transmission on the HS-DSCH is blocked. This could be the case e.g. due to bad radio<br>
conditions, due to the fact that the distance between the UE and the base station is too<br>
. great, or that there is an obstacle or due to an inappropriate configuration of the<br>
channels. The UE is then blocked, and temporarily, no data can be sent to /from the<br>
UE.<br>
[64]	The situation where the UE is blocked is shown on Figure 8..<br>
[65]	As shown in Figure 8, the UE is connected to a first cell 1 of a first base station A<br>
and a second cell 2 of the second base station B. In the case that the radio conditions<br>
towards the cell 1, where the HS-DSCH channel is configured, becomes worse than the<br>
radio conditions towards the cell 2, it is necessary to change the configuration such that<br>
the HS-DSCH is configured to be sent from the cell 2 in order to avoid that the contact<br>
between the UE and the RNC is lost.<br><br>
[66]	As shown on Figure 9, according" to a first step, the UE has radio links established<br>
with NodeB 1 and NodeB 2. The NodeB 1 is the NodeB that controls the HS-DSCH<br>
radio link..	.<br>
[67]	According to a second step, the radio link towards die NodeB 1 degrades, for<br>
instance because the UE moves away from the NodeB 1 towards the NodeB 2.<br>
[68]	According to a third step, the UE informs the RNC of the degradation in quality.<br>
[69]	According to a fourth step, the RNC starts a reconfiguration procedure in order to<br>
move the HS-DSCH from the NodeB 1 to the NodeB 2.<br>
[70]	In the case the radio quality degrades to a degree that the trans mission on the HS-<br>
DSCH is not possible any more the situation where me reconfiguration as shown on<br>
Figure 9, is not possible any more occurs. On the otiier hand the quality of the radio<br>
link towards the NodeB 2 could still be sufficiently good. In this case the UE is in a<br>
blocked situation, because the RNC can not send any information to the UE.<br>
[71]	Currentiy the only mechanism that applies is that at some point in time mere will be<br>
an "unrecoverable error" detected in either the UE or the RNC. In the case it is detected<br>
in the RNC, the RNC can delete the radio links that constitute the active set of the UE<br>
and provoke a radio link failure. In the case it is detected in the UE the UE will initiate<br>
a "Cell Update" procedure.<br>
[72]	As shown on Figure 10, according to a first step, the UE has radio links established	<br>
with NodeB 1 and NodeB 2. The NodeB 1 is the NodeB that controls the HS-DSCH<br>
radio link.<br>
[73] .	According to a second step, the radio link towards the NodeB 1 degrades, for .<br>
instance because the UE moves away from the NodeB 1 towards the NodeB 2.<br>
[74] .	According to a third step, the UE informs the RNC of the degradation in quality by<br>
transmitting a Measurement report. In the case the transmission on the HS-DSCH is<br>
already not possible any more the RNC will not be able to transmit the ac-<br>
knowledgment to the UE (3 a). This will lead to an RLC unrecoverable error which will<br>
result in a Cell Update procedure, where the SRBs 2, 3 and 4 are re-established.<br>
[75]	According to a fourth step, the RNC starts a reconfiguration procedure in order to<br>
move the HS-DSCH from the NodeB 1 to the NodeB 2. In the case that the downlink<br>
communication is not possible any more the message will be received from the RNC in<br>
the NodeB, but not be transmitted to the UE.<br>
[76]	According to a fifth step, either the UE, the NodeB or the RNC triggers a<br>
mechanism such that the UE will enter CELL_FACH state.<br>
[77]	According to a sixth step, the UE initiates the transmission of a Cell Update<br>
message.<br>
[78]	This message contains two Information Elements (IEs) that are used in order to<br>
indicate the group of RBs that carry RLC entities that have experienced an unre-<br><br>
coverable error, either the RLC entities mapped to RBs with identity 2, 3 and 4 or the<br>
RLC entities mapped to Radio Bearers RBs with identity higher than 4. This message<br>
also carries the IE "START". This IE contains a value that is used in order to'initialize<br>
the HFN value of the COUNT-C entity which is used for ciphering.<br>
[79]	According to a seventh step, the RNC initiates the transmission of a Cell Update<br>
Confirm message. In this message it can set the lEs "RLC re-establish indicator (RB2,<br>
RB3 and RB4)" and / or "RLC re-establish indicator (RB5 and upwards)" to "true" in<br>
order to re-establish the RLC entities. However in the case the RLC entities 3 and 4 are<br>
re-established some messages from NAS layer might be lost.<br>
[80]	According to an eighth step, upon reception of the message "Cell update Confirm"<br>
in the case the IEs "RLC re-establish indicator (RB2, RB3 and RB4)" and / or "RLC<br>
re-establish indicator (RB5 and upwards)" are set to "true" the UE re-initializes the<br>
RLC AM entities as indicated in the Cell Update Confirm message. The UE sets the<br>
most significant bits of the HFN of the COUNT-C s values for uplink and downlink to<br>
the START value. The remaining bits.in the HFN are set to 0, and the SNs of the RLC<br>
entity is also initialized to 0.<br>
[81]	According to a ninth step, the RNC re-initializes the RLC AM entities as indicated<br>
in the Cell Update Confirm message. The RNC sets the most significant bits of the<br>
HFN of the COUNT-C values for uplink and downlink to the START value. The<br>
remaining bits in the HFN are set to 0, and the SNs of the RLC entity is also initialized<br>
toO.<br>
[82]	According to a tenth step, the UE will send a confirmation message to the RNC.<br>
[83]	If the RLC entity used for SRB2 has not been re-established the message<br>
transmitted at the fourth step is still in the retransmission buffer of the RNC.<br>
According to an eleventh step, this message will be received by the UE after the<br>
reception of the Cell Update confirm message. However at this point in time the<br>
content of this message is not adequate any more.<br>
[84]	The UE could also apply a criteriaa criterion on the quality of the HS-DSCH<br>
channel, the available transmit power in the UE for uplink transmission or any other<br>
criteria in order to trigger the Cell Update.<br>
[85]	In the case that the SRBs are mapped on the HS-DSCH transport channel, it is<br>
possible that the RNC has sent data to the UE in order to change the UE configuration.<br>
However in the case the downlink transmission is impossible the data will not reach<br>
the UE. Once the UE / RNC have resolved the problem, by performing a Cell Update<br>
procedure as described above the Reconfiguration message will be transmitted to the<br>
UE. However the content of the Reconfiguration message will not be applicable<br>
anymore, and it is likely that it will trigger a protocol error. A means to re-establish the<br>
RLC entity / empty the re-transmission buffer of the RLC entity is therefore needed.<br><br>
[86]	Example 2 : Detection of an unrecoverable error by the UE<br>
■ [87]	In the case the UE detects an unrecoverable error in an RLC entity operating in AM<br>
mode the UE initiates a Cell Update Procedure.<br>
[88]	As illustrated on Figure 11, according to a first step, the UE detects an unre-<br>
coverable error in any AM RLC entity and transits to CELL_FACH state.<br>
[89]	According to a second step, the UE then sends a "Cell Update" message to the<br>
RNC. As indicated above this message contains two IES that are used in order to<br>
indicate the group of RBs that carry RLC entities that have experienced an unre-<br>
coverable error, either the RLC entities mapped to RBs with identity 2,3 and 4 or the R<br>
LC entities mapped to RBs with identity higher than 4. This message also carries the ■<br>
IE "START". This IE contains a value that is used in order to initialize the HFN value<br>
of the COUNT-C entity which is used for ciphering.<br>
[90]	According to a third step, the RNC indicates the re-establishment of either all RLC<br>
entities which are mapped to the RBs with identities 2,3 and 4, or all RLC entities<br>
which are mapped to the RBs with identities higher than 4 by using the Cell Update<br>
Confirm message.<br>
[91]	According to a fourth step, upon reception ofthe message "Cell update Confirm"<br>
the UE re-initializes the RLC AM entities as indicated in the Cell Update Confirm<br>
message. The UE sets the most significant bits of the HFN of the COUNT-C values for<br>
uplink and downlink to the START value. The remaining bits in the HFN are set to 0,<br>
and the SNs of the RLC entity is also initialized to 0.<br>
[92]	According to a fifth step, the RNC re-initializes the RLC AM entities as indicated in<br>
the Cell Update Confirm message. The RNC sets the most significant bits of the HFN<br>
of the COUNT-C values for uplink and downlink to the START value. The remaining<br>
bits in the HFN are set to 0, and the SNs of the RLC entity is also initialized to 0.<br>
[93]	According to a sixth step, the UE sends a message to confirm the re-establishment.<br>
[94]	In the case the UE detects an unrecoverable error in a AM RLC entity, the UE can<br>
only indicate in which set of RLC entities there is an error.<br>
[95]	In the case the UE detects an error in the decoding of an RLC UM bearer, the UE is<br>
currently not allowed to initiate any procedure to signal this error to the RNC.<br>
[96]	Therefore, in the case the RNC has realized an unrecoverable error the RNC has no<br>
currently available means to initiate the re-establishment of the RLC entity affected by<br>
the error.<br>
[97]	This is important because in the case that RLC entities of the RBTds IDs 3 and / or<br>
4 carrying information of the higher layer (NAS) are re-established in the downlink,<br>
data could be lost. Since there is no means for the RNC to verify whether the data has<br>
been received by the UE, and on the other hand the RNC is not allowed to duplicate<br>
the data the RNC can only release the signalling connection in this case.<br><br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
Technical Problem<br>
[98]	One aspect of the present invention involves the recognition by the present<br>
inventors of the drawbacks in the related art, as explained above. Based upon such<br>
recognition, improvements to radio link control error handling procedures can be<br>
achieved according to the present invention.<br>
[99]	It is a desired result of the present invention to minimize lost loss of data when<br>
settling errors in a radio link control entity.<br>
[100J	According to the method of the invention, a radio link control entity which is<br>
affected by an error is exactly identified and therefore a procedure for resolving the<br>
error can be initiated only in the radio link control entity identified.<br>
[101]	The method of the invention allows to apply the procedure for resolving the error to<br>
specific RLC entities, and hot on a group of radio link control entities without dis-<br>
tinguishing between entities that are in error and entities that operate correctly, as in<br>
the related art.<br>

Mode for the Invention<br>
[116]	The present invention is described as being implemented in a 3.GPP type mobile<br>
communications system. However, the features of the present invention may also be<br>
adapted and implemented in communications systems operating under other types of<br>
communication specifications (e.g., 3GPP2, 4G, IEEE, OMA, etc.), because the<br>
concepts and teachings of the present invention could be applied to various com-<br>
munication schemes that operate in a similar manner based upon common techniques.<br>
[117]	One aspect of the invention is that the UE reports detailed information about the<br>
situation of errors/dysfunctions in RLC entities. This additional information could<br>
contain: .<br>
[118]	(1) the RB id of the radio bearer that carries data of the RLC entity<br>
[119]	(2) any other identifier of the RLC entity<br>
[120]	(3) the type of error, e.g.<br>
[121]	- reception of undefined control information<br>
[122]	- detection of errors by higher layer protocols, e.g. PDCP / IP etc. which indicate<br>
an error of the RLC operation<br>
[123]	- situations defined in the RLC protocol as unrecoverable error<br>
[124]	- situations detected by any other means in the UE implementation that indicates an<br>
error	■<br>
[125]	- detection of a dysfunction in the deciphering<br>
[126]	- Uplink or Uplink/Downlink or Downlink only affected<br>
[127]	Another aspect of the invention is a UE that initiates the transmission of the above<br>
additional information at the moment when any of the errors listed above are detected.<br>
The transmission of the message in the uplink can be done on the current con-<br>
figuration, or include also a state transition. Especially the error detected in a UM<br>
entity can be a trigger for the transmission of the message, where the procedure to<br>
detect the error could be implementation specific.<br>
[128]	A further aspect of the invention concerns a UTRAN that re-initializes / re-<br>
establishes an RLC entity. One possibility is that the RNC sends an indication to re-<br>
establish the RLC entity in the UE in a message sent to the UE or that the RNC sends a<br><br>
new message which indicates that the RLC entity needs to be re-established to the UE.<br>
Additional information is needed to indicate the RLC entity, or the RB id of the radio<br>
bearer that carries data of the RLC entity that shall be re-initialized/re-established, the<br>
direction of the transmission etc.<br>
[129]	Exemplary embodiments of the present invention will be described hereafter.<br>
[130]	Figure 12 schematically illustrates a method for settling an error in a radio link<br>
control entity according to a first embodiment of the invention, in case the quality of<br>
the radio link between the UE and the network degrades (HS-DSCH RL.failure case).<br>
[131]	According to a first step, the UE has radio links established with NodeB 1 and<br>
NodeB 2. The NodeB 1 is the NodeB that controls the HS-DSCH radio link.<br>
[132]	According to a second step, the radio link towards the NodeB 1 degrades, for<br>
instance because the UE moves away from the NodeB 1 towards the NodeB 2.<br>
[133]	According to a third step, the UE informs the RNC of the degradation in quality by<br>
transmitting a Measurement report. In the case the transmission on the HS-DSCH is<br>
already not possible any more the RNC will not be able to transmit the ac-<br>
knowledgment to the UE (3a). This will lead to an RLC unrecoverable error which will<br>
result in a Cell Update procedure.<br>
[134]	According to a fourth step, the RNC starts a reconfiguration procedure in order to<br>
move the HS-DSCH from the NodeB 1 to the NodeB 2.'In the case that the downlink<br>
communication is not possible any more the message will be received from the RNC in<br>
the NodeB, but not be transmitted up to the UE.<br>
[135]	According to a fifth step, either the UE, the NodeB or the RNC triggers a<br>
mechanism such that the UE will enter CELL_FACH state.<br>
[136]	According to a sixth step, the UE initiates the transmission of a Cell Update<br>
message or URA update message to the RNC.<br>
[137]	In the UMTS system the Cell Update message or UMTS Routing Area (URA)<br>
update message is normally used in order to indicate an unrecoverable error in the<br>
uplink to the RNC. This message is sent on the CCCH from the UE to the RNC. It is<br>
current practice to add "non-critical extensions" to the message sent by the UE in the.<br>
uplink to newer releases of the protocol specification. These extensions are coded in a<br>
way that an RNC that does not understand the extension can still decode the part of the<br>
message that the RNC understands.<br>
[138]	According to a first possibility, the Cell Update message or URA update message<br>
includes data identifying a radio bearer associated to the radio link control entity which<br>
is affected by the error.<br>
[139]	For instance, the Cell update or URA update message includes an extension which<br>
contains a list of RB identities and / or identities of RLC entities for which an error<br>
according to the above has occurred.<br><br>
[140]	According to a second possibility, the Cell Update or URA update message includes<br>
a binary variable. The binary variable designates a particular radio bearer, the radio<br>
bearer being associated with the radio link control entity which is affected by the error.<br>
The binary variable thus identifies the radio link control entity.<br>
[141]	For instance, the Cell update or URA update message includes an extension which<br>
contains at least one IE (true / false) and / or cause value which indicates that a RB and<br>
/ or RLC entity for which the identity or the identity of the RB that carries data of this<br>
entity (e.g. the SRB 2) is specified in the standard and / or the transmission direction of<br>
that RLC entity affected to the "Cell update" or "URA Update" message.<br>
[142]	In an alternative, the Cell update or URA update message includes an extension<br>
which contains the information that all or a subset of all RLC entities using UM mode<br>
have experienced an error, and / or the error cause / and or the direction (uplink, uplink<br>
/ downlink, downlink) to the "Cell update" or "URA Update" message. Especially the<br>
subset could be all RLC entities using RLC UM mode except the RLC entities mapped<br>
on the SRB 0 and 1.<br>
[143]	The Cell Update message or URA Update message also includes a START value.<br>
The START value is an initialization value allowing to re-synchronize the counter in<br>
the radio link control entity of the user equipment and the counter in a radio link<br>
control entity of the cellular network.<br>
[144]	The Cell Update message or URA update message can also include data indicative<br>
of a cause of the error.<br>
[145]	In this case, the Cell update message or URA update message includes an extension<br>
which contains an IE that indicates the cause of the error.<br>
[146]	The Cell Update message or URA update message can also include data indicative<br>
of a transmission direction of a radio bearer associated to the radio link control entity<br>
which is affected by the error.<br>
[147]	In this case, the Cell update or URA update message includes an extension which<br>
contains an IE that indicates the transmission direction of the RLC entity affected by<br>
"the error.<br>
[148]	The already available mechanism for indication of unrecoverable error in the "Cell<br>
update" or "URA update" message needs to be maintained in order to ensure that a UE<br>
that sends this message to an RNC that does not understand the extension containing<br>
the list. Here, it should be noted that the RB can use the legacy mechanism to indicate<br>
RLC unrecoverable errors.<br>
[149]	The UE can also indicate RLC entities where an error has occurred and eventually<br>
provide additional information. In the case the RNC would not have implemented this<br>
method it would just ignore the information.<br>
[150]	The transmission of the message from the UE to the RNC is triggered in the case<br><br>
the UE has detected any error situation or dysfunction (e.g., ciphering problems) in an<br>
RLC entity in the uplink and / or downlink. The message containing the information<br>
according to the above would be transmitted according to the currently available spec-<br>
ification rather on the CCCH logical channel mapped on the RACH transport channel<br>
which is normally mapped on the PRACH physical channel. However it is possible to<br>
transmit this information also on any other logical, transport or physical channel, and<br>
the mapping does not restrict at all the invention. In order to be able to transmit a<br>
message on the PRACH channel it might be necessary that the UE initiates a state<br>
transition, i.e. the UE would move to the CELLJFACH state, while stopping the<br>
reception / transmission on the channels that are used in the CELL_DCH state.<br>
Especially the detection of an error (undefined control information, gap bigger than the<br>
SN space, problem of deciphering) in an RLC UM entity would be a new trigger for<br>
the state transition to CELL_FACH and the transmission of the message containing the<br>
information as described above.<br>
[151]	Any extension according to the above alternatives could also be sent on any other<br>
RB / transport channel / physical channel and could be added to any other message in<br>
the uplink. When the UE detects that one or more RLC entities are not working<br>
correctly any more and the UE indicates this in other messages to the RNC, the UE<br>
would also include a START value in order to allow the RNC and the UE to re-<br>
initialize the MSB of the HFN of the COUNT-C values with the same value.<br>
[152]	According to a seventh step, the RNC initiates the transmission of a message. In the<br>
case the RNC has implemented the method, the message indicates the RLC entity that<br>
has to be re-established. The RNC can indicate RLC entities to be re-established inde-<br>
pendently of whether they were indicated in the Cell Update or URA update message<br>
sent by the UE.<br>
[153]	The message sent by the RNC to the UE can be.a Cell Update confirm message, a<br>
URA Update Confirm message, a UTRAN mobility information message, a Radio<br>
Bearer Reconfiguration message, a Radio Bearer Setup message, a Radio Bearer<br>
Release message, a Transport Channel Reconfiguration message or a Physical Channel<br>
Reconfiguration message.<br>
[154]	Other messages could be sent, and new messages could be created in order to carry<br>
the information on the re-establishment.<br>
[155]	The message sent by the RNC includes data identifying the radio link control entity<br>
which must be re-established.<br>
[156]	According to a first possibility, the RNC sends a Cell Update Confirm message<br>
including data identifying a radio bearer associated to the radio link control entity.<br>
[157]	For instance, the Cell update or URA update message includes an extension which<br>
' contains a list of RB identities and / or identities of RLC entities for which an error<br><br>
according to the above has occurred.<br>
[158]	According to a second possibility, the RNC sends a Cell Update Confirm message<br>
including a binary variable. The binary variable designates a particular radio bearer,<br>
the radio bearer being associated with the radio link control entity which is affected by<br>
the error. The binary variable thus identifies the radio link control entity.<br>
[159]	For instance, the Cell Update Confirm message includes an extension which<br>
contains at least one IE (true / false) and / or cause value which indicates that a RB and<br>
/ or RLC entity for which the identity or the identity of the RB that carries data of this<br>
entity (e.g. the SRB 2) is specified in the standard and / or the transmission direction of<br>
that RLC entity affected to the Cell update: Confirm message.<br>
[160]	In an alternative, the Cell Update Confirm message includes an extension which<br>
contains the information that all or a subset of all RLC entities using UM mode have<br>
experienced an error, and / or the error cause / and or the direction (uplink, uplink /<br>
downlink, downlink) to me "Cell update" or "URA update" message. Especially the<br>
subset could be all RLC entities using RLC UM mode except the RLC entities mapped<br>
on the SRB 0 and 1.<br>
[161]	According to an eighth step, upon reception of the Cell update Confirm message,<br>
the user equipment re-initializes the radio link control entity according to the data<br>
included in the message.<br>
[162]	The UE sets the most significant bits of the HFN of the COUNT-Cs value for<br>
uplink and downlink to the START value. The remaining bits in the HFN are set to 0,<br>
and the SNs of the RLC entity is also initialized to 0.<br>
[1631	According to a ninth step, the RNC re-initializes the RLC AM entities as indicated<br>
in the Cell Update Confirm message. The RNC sets the most significant bits of die<br>
HFN of the COUNT-C values for uplink and downlink to the START value. The<br>
remaining bits in the HFN are set to 0, and the SNs of the RLC entity are also<br>
initialized to 0.<br>
[164]	When the RNC sends a message including the information about the establishment<br>
of an RLC AM / UM entity in the uplink, downlink or uplink and downlink, the RNC<br>
re-establishes the corresponding part of the RLC entities by resetting the corresponding<br>
state variables as described in the RLC specification of 3GPP and / or initializing the<br>
MSB of the HFN of the direction of the corresponding RLC entity with a "START"<br>
value which has been synchronised between the UE and the RNC before, e.g. when the<br>
"START" value has been transmitted from the UE to the RNC in the "Cell update"<br>
message. Upon reception of the message, the UE re-establishes the corresponding part<br>
of the RLC entities by resetting the corresponding state variables as described in the<br>
RLC specification of 3GPP and / or initializing the MSB of the HFN of the direction of<br>
the corresponding RLC entity with a "START" value which has been synchronised<br><br>
between the UE and the RNC before, e.g. when the "START" value has been<br>
transmitted from the UE to the RNC in the "Cell update" message.<br>
[165]	According to a tenth step, the UE sends a confirmation message to the RNC.<br>
[166]'	Figure 13 illustrates a method for settling an error in a radio link control entity<br>
according to a second embodiment of the invention, in case a user equipment (UE)<br>
detects an unrecoverable error in the operation of the radio link control entity.<br>
I-167]	According to a first step, the UE detects an unrecoverable error in any AM RLC<br>
entity and transits to CELL_FACH state.<br>
[168]	According to a second step, the UE sends a Cell Update message to the RNC, the<br>
message indicating.an unrecoverable error.<br>
[169]	The Cell Update Message includes data identifying the radio link control entity<br>
which is in error.<br>
[170]	According to a first possibility, the Cell Update message includes a binary variable.<br>
The binary variable designates a particular radio bearer, the radio bearer being<br>
associated with the radio link control entity which is affected by the error. The binary<br>
variable thus identifies the.radio link control entity.<br>
[171]	According to a second possibility, the Cell Update message-includes data<br>
identifying a radio bearer associated to the radio link control entity.<br>
[172] . The Cell Update message also includes a START value. The START value is an<br>
initialization value allowing to re-synchronize the counter in the radio link control<br>
entity of the user equipment and the counter in a radio link control entity of the cellular<br>
network.<br>
[173]	The Cell Update message can also include data indicative of a cause of the error and<br>
data indicative of a transmission direction of a radio bearer associated to the radio link'<br>
control entity which is affected by the error.<br>
[174]	The UE can also indicate RLC entities where an error has occurred and eventually.<br>
additional information.<br>
[175]	In the case the RNC would not have implemented this method it would just ignore<br>
the information.<br>
[176]	According to a third step, the RNC initiates a transmission of a Cell Update<br>
Confirm message. In the case the RNC has implemented the method, the RNC<br>
indicates the RLC entity that it wants to be re-established. The RNC can indicate RLC<br>
entities to be re-established independently of whether they are indicated in the Cell<br>
Update message.<br>
[177]	The Cell Update Confirm message includes data identifying the radio link control<br>
• entity which is in error.<br>
[178]	According to a first possibility, the Cell Update Confirm message includes a binary<br>
variable. The binary variable designates a particular radio bearer, the radio bearer<br><br>
being associated with the radio link control entity which is affected by the error, The<br>
binary variable thus identifies the radio link control entity.<br>
[179]	According to a second possibility, the Cell Update Confirm message includes data<br>
identifying a radio bearer associated to the radio link control entity.<br>
[180]	According to a fourth step, upon reception of the Cell update Confirm message, the<br>
UE re-initializes the deficient RLC AM entities according to the data included in the<br>
Cell Update Confirm message.<br>
[181]	The UE upon reception of this message re-establishes the RLC entity. The UE<br>
eventually re-initializes the RLC entity in only one direction. The UE eventually uses<br>
the START value transmitted in the Cell Update message in order to initialize the MSB<br>
of the HFN of the COUNT-C of the direction that is ordered to be re-established in the<br>
Cell Update Confirm message.<br>
[182]	During this recovery procedure, parts of messages that have been received before<br>
are removed from the RNC buffer, so that they will not be received and/or re-<br>
transmission will be not requested by the UE after the recovery procedure. Especially<br>
in the case the RNC indicates to re-establish RLC entity 2 this will allow the RNC to<br>
remove the message sent in the fourth step.<br>
[183]	According to a fifth step, the RNC re-initializes the RLC AM entities as indicated in<br>
the Cell Update Confirm message.<br>
[184]	The RNC eventually re-initializes the RLC entity in only one direction. The RNC<br>
eventually uses the START value transmitted in the Cell Update message in order to<br>
initialize the MSB of the HFN of the COUNT-C of the direction that is ordered to be<br>
re-established in the Cell Update Confirm message.<br>
[185]	During this recovery procedure, parts of messages that have been received before<br>
are removed from the RNC buffer, so that they will not be received and/or re-<br>
transmission will not be requested by the UE after the recovery procedure.<br>
[186]	According to a sixth step, the UE sends a message in order to acknowledge the<br>
reception of the Cell Update Confirm message and to confirm the re-establishment.<br>
[187]	In the above description of Figures 12 and 13 the exchange of messages between<br>
the RNC and the UE is described. However, the role of the RNC can be taken by any<br>
other entity, within the scope of the present invention.<br>
[188]	To implement the various features described above, the present invention can<br>
employ various types of hardware and/or software components (modules). For<br>
example, different hardware modules may contain various circuits and components<br>
necessary to perform the steps of the above method. Also, different software modules<br>
(executed by processors and/or other hardware) may contain various codes and<br>
protocols necessary to perform the steps of the present invention method.<br>
[189]	The present invention provides a method of performing a cell update procedure,<br><br>
comprising: detecting an error associated with a radio link established with a base<br>
station; informing the base station about at least one radio bearer, at least one radio link<br>
control entity, or both having the detected error; and re-configuring the at least one<br>
radio bearer, re-establishing the at least one radio link control entity, or both based<br>
upon the informing step.<br>
[190]	The steps may be performed for acknowledged mode operation or for unac-<br>
knowledged mode operation. The error may indicate reception of undefined control in-<br>
formation. The error may indicate detection of errors by higher layer protocols which<br>
indicate an error of the RLC operation. The error may indicate situations defined in the<br>
radio link control protocol as unrecoverable error. The error may indicate situations<br>
detected by any other means in mobile station implementation that indicates an error.<br>
The error may indicate detection of a dysfunction in the deciphering. The error may<br>
indicate whether the uplink or uplink/downlink or downlink is affected. If the re-<br>
configuring is performed, a re-transmission buffer is flushed. The informing may be<br>
performed by using cell update messages or URA update messages. The cell update<br>
messages or URA update messages may include extensions, indicating that all or a<br>
subset of all radio link control entities have experienced an error and/or a cause of the<br>
error and/or a transmission direction of the radio link control entity affected by the<br>
error. A legacy mechanism may be additionally used to indicate radio link control un-<br>
recoverable errors.<br>
[191]	Also, the present invention provides a method of performing a cell update<br>
procedure, comprising: discovering, by the mobile station, an error associated with a<br>
radio link established with a base station; reporting, by a mobile station to a base<br>
station, information about errors and/or dysfunctions in radio link control entities and/<br>
or errors in at least one radio bearer as a result of the discovering step; and updating,<br>
by the mobile station and/or the base station, at least one radio link control entity and/ .<br>
or at least one radio bearer based upon the reporting step.<br>
[192]	The updating step may comprise: re-establishing at least one radio link control<br>
entity, re-configuring at least one radio bearer, or performing both the re-establishing<br>
and re-configuring steps. The information may comprise at least one of a radio bearer<br>
identification of a radio bearer that carries data of a corresponding radio link control<br>
■ entity, other identifiers of the radio link control entity that has the errors and/or dys-<br>
functions, and a type of error. The steps are performed for acknowledged mode<br>
operation or unacknowledged mode operation.<br>
