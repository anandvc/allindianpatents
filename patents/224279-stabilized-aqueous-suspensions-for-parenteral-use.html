The present invention is in the fie!d of galenic preparations. It concerns in particular a pharmaceutical aqueous suspension of a biologically active compound, e.g. a steroidal compound, having stabilized pH, particularly suitable for parenteral administration. The inventors of the present invention have found that the pH of a pharmaceutical aqueous suspension of a biologically active compound can be controlled by adding a pH controlling effective concentration of L-Methionine thereto. Moreover, when a pH controlling effective concentration of L-Methionine is used, it strengthens the buffering capacity of low concentrations of conventional buffering agents with a super-additive (synergistic) effect. In this way the use of conventional buffering agents can be eliminated or limited, thus improving the re-suspendabiiity and controlled flocculation of the pharmaceutical preparation.<br>
Background of tlie invention<br>
A pharmaceutical suspension is a coarse (Aspersion in which insoluble solid particles<br>
are dispersed in a liquid medium.<br>
Suspensions contribute to pharmacy and medicine by supplying insoluble and often<br>
distasteful substances in a form that is pleasant to the taste, by providing a suitable<br>
form for the application of dermatological materials to the skin and sometimes to the<br>
mucous membranes, and for the parenteral administration of insoluble drugs. Therefore<br>
pharmaceutical suspensions may be classified into three groups: orally administered<br>
mixtures, externally applied lotions and injectable preparations.<br>
An   acceptable   suspension   possesses   certain   desirable   qualities,   including the<br>
followings:<br>
i) the suspended material should not settle rapidly;<br>
ii) the particles that do settle to the bottom of the container must not form a hard cake<br>
but should be readily re-dispersed into a uniform mixture when the container is shaken;<br><br>
iii) the suspension must not be too viscous to pour freely from the orifice of the bottle or to flow through a syringe needle.<br>
It is important that the characteristics of the dispersed phase are chosen with care so to as to produce a suspension having optimum physical, chemical and pharmacological properties. Particle size distribution, specific surface area, inhibition of crystal growth, and changes in the polymorphic form are of special significance and the formulator must ensure that these and other properties do not change sufficiently during storage to adversely affect the performance of the suspensions with aging. In the field of injectable preparations, aqueous suspensions -forâ€” parenteral administration have already been described in scientific and patent literature and have been known for a long time. Parenteral suspensions are often prepared with the so called "controlled flocculation" approach, i.e. by the application of known principles of formulation chemistry to produce vehicles which permits drug floes to form and settle, but which they are easily re-suspended with slight agitarion and remain uniformly dispersed or suspended during the period required for therapeutic administration. Specifically, it is well known that one of the main difficulty in formulating parenteral aqueous suspensions of steroids is the overcome of their hydrophobicity, that significantly reduce the wettability, suspendability or re-suspendibility of the active in aqueous media. Both wetting and suspending agents are needed in order to gain the proper formulation of the active compound such as the concomitant use of preservatives. This is described, for example, by Nash and coworkers in the US Patent 3,457,348 where non-ionic surfactants (such as polysorbates) and suspending agents (like polyethylene glycols) are the basic excipients to gain the proper stability of the formulation.<br>
Sometimes, even in the presence of the proper suspending and wetting agents, the suspension is not stable for a long time, but it is necessary to form Jt just before the administration (while it is stored as lyophilized formulation). This is described, for example, in the case described by Geller and coworkers in the US Patent 5,002,940 and greatly impacts on the cost of the manufacturing process, since an additional freeze-drying process is mandatory.<br><br>
Even if an improved physical stability of steroidai drug suspensions in water can be<br>
gained,  as above mentioned,  by the use of polyethylene glycols and non-ionic<br>
surfactants, some chemical stability issues, such as a relevant pH reduction, are likely<br>
to be faced during development.<br>
In fact, for instance, both polyethylene glycols and polysorbates, when in solution, may<br>
undergo degradation, leading to the fomiation of acid species such as formic and acetic<br>
acid.<br>
An example of this pH reduction effect is given in Table 1.<br>
Table 1: pH of a typical vehicle for parenteral aqueous suspensions formulations<br>
Vehicle composition  (batch   13169/124 A):    Methylparaben 0.2%, propylparaben 0.02%, sodium chloride 0.9%, PEG 4000 3%, polysorbate 80 0.3%, sodium hydroxide<br><br>
This pH reduction occurs both at accelerated testing conditions and at room temperature. Considering that after only 6 months at .room temperature a relevant decrease of approximately 1.5 pH unit is experimented, very low pH values (close or below 3) are anticipated after long-term storage (1 - 2 years). This fact necessarily causes the reduced shelf life of parenteral suspension, being the progressive acidification of the formulation linked to the impossibility to administer the formulation, e.g. by intramuscular or subcutaneous injection, without generating significant pain on patients (it is advisable that the pH value is maintained above 3 for administering a painless formulation).<br><br>
This pH variation during storage can be minimized by appropriately buffering the formulation. The most obvious approach, in order to maintain the pH within specific and predetermined limits, is the use of buffering agents, such as inorganic acid salts, in appropriate concentrations in order not only to exert but also to maintain their buffering capacity. An example of buffering agents commonly used in parenteral formulations and of their usual ^concentrations can be found in Pharmaceutical Dosage Form: Parenteral Medications, Volume 1, 2"'^ Edition, Chapter 5, p. 194, De Luca and Boylan, "Formulation of Small Volume Parenterals", Table 5: Commonly used additives in Parenteral Products.<br>
The use of inorganic acid salts as buffering agents offers to the formulator both advantages and disadvantages. In fact, if a careful control of pH of formulations could be gained, on the contrary, when suspension formulations are concerned, ionic species tend to destabilize the fommlations with detrimental effects on the re-suspendability and on the controlled flocculation of the formulation. This means that the use of inorganic acid salt based buffering systems into the formulations has to be minimized. In fact, when talking about parenteral suspension, according to Nash (Parenteral Suspensions, Bulletin of Parenteral Drug Association, March-April 1972, Vol. 26, No. 2), "... indiscriminate use of salts and buffers is normally avoided, provided chemical stability is not a problem since changes in electrolyte concentration often have a profound effect on the absorbed surface charge of suspension particles". An example of the relevant pH decrease occurring in a medroxyprogesterone acetate parenteral aqueous suspension is showed in Table 2. This accelerated stability study shows that the pH of an unbuffered formulation significantly decrease from an initial pH value of approx. 6.5 to pH values of 3 or lower than 3. It also demonsfrates that, when a usual concentration (approx. 1%) of phosphate buffer is added to control the pH, a detrimental effect on the suspension re-suspendability and syringeability is experimented. In fact an increased time of manual wrist shaking is needed to re-suspend the buffered suspension after 1 month at 55Â°C vs. the unbuffered one. Besides, after 2 month at 55"C the buffered suspension cannot be re-suspended at all by manual wrist shaking and, as a consequence, cannot be administered- On the other hand, when a lower and unusual concentration (approx. 0.1%) of phosphate buffer is used, no<br><br>
relevant effect on suspension re-suspendability is experimented but, at the same time, no substantial pH control is obtained.<br>

Description of the invention<br>
The inventors of the present invention have surprisingly found out that suitable concentrations of L-Methionine are able both to control the pH of a pharmaceutical aqueous suspension of a biologically active compound, in particular a steroidal compound, by minimizing its pH decrease and to strengthen the pH controlling<br><br>
capacity of lower and unusual concentrations of conventional buffering agents, with a<br>
super-additive (synergistic) effect.<br>
In fact the gist of the present invention is based on the finding that an oxygen<br>
scavenger such as L-Methionine not only shows antioxidant properties per se, liks<br>
known antl-oxidant thiol-derivatives, but surprisingly itself takes part in pH controUing<br>
activity.<br>
A first object of the present invention is thus to provide the use of L-Methionine as pH<br>
contiolling   agent in   a  pharmaceutical   aqueous   suspension   formulation   having<br>
substantially stabilized pH, for parenteral  administration  of a biolegieally active<br>
compound.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide a pharmaceutical aqueous<br>
suspension formulation for parenteral administration having substantially stabilized pH<br>
comprising   a   biologically   active   compound   and   a   pH   controlling   effective<br>
concentration of L-Methionine.<br>
Object of the invention is also the use of L-Methionine, in a pH controlling effective<br>
concentration, in the preparation of a phamiaceutical aqueous suspension formulation<br>
having substantially stabilized pH, for parenteral administration of a biologically acdve<br>
compound.<br>
A further object is a method for preparing a pharmaceutical aqueous suspension<br>
formulation for parenteral administration of a biologically active compound having<br>
substantially  stabilized  pH,   characterized   in   that  a   pH   controlling   effective<br>
concentration of L-Methionine is added thereto.<br>
The inventors have also found that L-Methionine, besides exercising a pH controlling<br>
activity per se, also strengthens the pH controlling capacity of a conventional buffer<br>
with a (super-additive) synergistic effect.<br>
A super-additive (synergistic) effect is a pH controlling effect that is greater than the<br>
one which is expected to be obtainable by summing up the experimentally verified pH<br>
controlling effects of the single agents. â– <br>
This means that low unusual concentrations of conventional buffering agents can be<br>
included into the formulations, without any risk of loosing in buffering capacity and, at<br><br>
the same time, to deteriorate the physico-technological quality of parenteral suspensions.<br>
A further advantage is given by the fact that as no relevant concentrations of buffers are needed, the formulation has low or no buffering capacity per se and therefore, once administered, the pH of the foraiulaiion will be easily adjusted to the physiological value by the buffering capacity of body fluids.<br>
As stated above, the reduction in the quantity of conventional buffering agents, such as inorganic acid salts, improves the physical stability of the fonnulation, since ionic species tend to destabilize the formulations with detrimental effects "on the re-suspendibility and on the controlled flocculation of the fonnulation. A further object of the invention is therefore to provide a pharmaceutical aqueous suspension formulation for parenteral administration having substantially stabilized pH comprising a biologically active compound, a buffering agent and L-Methionine in concentrations effective to produce a pH controlling super-additive effect. The present invention also provides the combined use of L-Methionine and a conventional buffering agent in concentrations effective to produce a pH controlling super-additive effect, in the preparation of a pharmaceutical aqueous suspension formulation having substantially stabilized pH, for parenteral administration of a biologically active compound.<br>
The terra "a buffering agent" is herein meant to comprise (unless otherwise specified) both a single buffering agent and a mixture of two or more thereof. The term "substantially pH stabilized" means that the pH of the fonnulation remains within acceptable limits for parenteral admimstration over the time, according to well known practice in the art. It also means that the pH of the formulation containing L-Methionine, or the combination of L-Methionine and a buffering agent in â–  concentrations effective to provide a pH controlling super-additive effect, is ;: maintained over the time closer to the initial value than the pH of the "as is" fonnulation (i.e. the formulation without L-Methionine or the combination of L-Methionine and a buffering agent).<br>
The pH range for the suspension formulation of the invention is from about pH 3.0 to about pH 8.0, preferably pH 3.0 to pH 7.5, and most preferably pH 4.0 to pH 7.0.<br><br>
A pH controUing effective concentration of L-Methionine, when used as a single pH<br>
controlling agent, may vary from about 0.005% w/v to about 5% w/v, preferably from<br>
about 0.01% w/v to about 1.0% w/v.<br>
The pH controlling effective concentration of L-Methionine, when used as a combinetl<br>
pH controlling agent, may be substantially the same as above.<br>
Thanks to the pH controlling properties of L-Methionine and the superadditive pH<br>
controlling effect, which is obtainable by using L-Methionine in combination with a<br>
conventional buffering agent, the concentration of the latter can be reduced by about<br>
50% to about 95%.   Namely the concentration of the buffering agenti^canlhus range<br>
from about 5% to about 50% of the usual buffering concentration thereof, preferably<br>
from about 5 % to about 25 %.<br>
The usual concentrations of conventional buffering agents employed in parenteral<br>
formulations can be found in: Pharmaceutical Dosage Form: Parenteral Medications,<br>
Volume 1, 2" Edition, Chapter 5, p. 194, De Luca and Boylan, "Formulation of Small<br>
Volume Parenterals", Table 5: Commonly used additives in Parenteral Products.<br>
According to said literature, the usual buffering concentration for phosphoric acid salts<br>
range from about 0.8% to about 2.0% w/v or w/w. On the contrary, thanks to the newly<br>
found super-additive effect, the concentration of phosphoric acid salts according to the<br>
formulation of the invention are lower than 0.4% w/w or w/v, preferably lower than<br>
0.2% w/w or w/v.<br>
Re-suspendibility   and   controlled   flocculation   of  the   pharmaceutical   aqueous<br>
suspension are thus improved.<br>
The pharmaceutical aqueous suspension, according to the invention, may in addition<br>
also include one or more surfactants, suspending agents and/or thickening agents.<br>
Suitable surfactants are for instance phospholipids (e.g. lecithin), cationic surfactants<br>
(e.g. myristylgammapicolinium chloride), anionic surfactants and non-ionic surfactants<br>
(e.g. polysorbate 80).<br>
Suitable    suspending    and/or    density    adjusting    agents     are    for    instance<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone compounds and polyethylene glycols. Preferred examples of<br>
polyethylene glycols are those having a molecular weight from about 300 to about<br>
6000,   e.g.   polyethylene   glycol  3350   and  polyethylene   glycol   4000.   Preferred<br><br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) compounds according to the invention are those having a<br>
molecQiar weight from about 7000 to about 54000, for instance PVP K:12, K17, K25<br>
and K30, in particular K12 and K17, PVP K17 being the most preferred. According to<br>
a preferred embodiment of the invention, the pharmaceutical aqueous suspension<br>
formulation of the invention in addition contain a suitable amount of a PVP compound,<br>
in particular K12 or K17, especially K17.<br>
Suitable  thickening  or  viscosity agents are  for instance  weU  known   cellulose<br>
derivatives (e.g. methylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose and<br>
hydroxypropylmethylcellulose), gelatin and acacia, in particular methylcellutose.<br>
In addition, the formulations of the present invention may also include metal chelating<br>
agents, antioxidants or thiol-containing compounds and preservatives.<br>
Suitable metal chelating agents are for instance ethyienediamine-tetracetic acid salts<br>
(e.g. edetate disodium).<br>
Suitable antioxidants are for instance ascorbic acid derivatives (e.g. ascorbic acid,<br>
erythorbic acid, sodium ascorbate),    thiol derivatives (e.g. thioglycerol, cysteine,<br>
acetylcysteine,  cystine,   dithioerythreitol, dithiothreitol,  gluthathione),  tocopherols,<br>
butylated hydroxyanisole, butylated hydroxytoluene, sulfurous acid salts (e.g. sodium<br>
sulfate, sodium bisulfite, acetone sodium bisulfite, sodium metabisulfite, sodium<br>
sulfite,       sodium      formaldehyde      sulfoxylate,      sodium      thiosulfate)      and<br>
nordihydroguaiareUcacid.<br>
Suitable preservatives are for instance phenol, chlorobutanol, benzylalcohol, methyl<br>
paraben, propyl paraben, benzalkonium chloride and cetylpyridinium chloride.<br>
In addition,- the formulations of the present invention may also include tonicity-<br>
adjusting agents. Suitable tonicity adjusting agents are for instance sodium chloride,<br>
sodium sulfate, dextrose, mannitol and glycerol.<br>
The formulations of the present invention may also have^a nitrogen blanket-overlay on<br>
the head-space of the vial. Additionally, the formulations of the present invention may<br>
include purging the formulation buffer with helium, argon, or nitrogen.<br>
When the forraulation of the invention, besides L-Methionine, contains also buffering<br>
agents, useful buffers include e.g. those derived from acetic, aconitic, citric, glutaric,<br>
lactic, malic, succinic, phosphate and carbonic acids, as known in the art. Typically<br><br>
employed is an alkali or alkaline earth salt of one of the aforementioned acids. Phosphate and citrate buffers, such as phosphoric acid or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, or citric acid or a pharmaceutical ly acceptable salt thereof, are preferred. Sodium phosphate or sodium citrate is the preferred buffering agents, with sodium phosphate being most preferred.<br>
The  pharmaceutical  aqueous  suspension  according to  the  invention  is  e.g.  for â–  intramuscular,    subcutaneous    and    intradermal    administration,    preferably    for intramuscular and subcutaneous administration.<br>
A biological active compound according to the invention is any compound that after administration to a mammal, including humans, provides a therapeutic effect. Preferably it is a steroidal biologically active compound.<br>
A steroidal biologically active compound according to the invention is the steroidal compound itself or, when appropriate, a pharmaceutical ly acceptable salt thereof as known in the art, e.g. medroxyprogesterone acetate, exemestane, estradiol cypionate, methylprednisolone  acetate,  oxabolone   cypionate,  clostebol   acetate,   testosterone cypionate;    preferably    medroxyprogesterone    acetate,    estradiol    cypionate    and exemestane, or a combination of two or more thereof according to the art. Concentrations of medroxyprogesterone acetate in the formulation can range from, about 1% w/v to about 40% w/v, preferably from about 3% w/v to about 30% w/v. Concentrations of estradiol cypionate in the formulation can range from about 0A% w/v to about 5% w/v, preferably from about 0.25% w/v to about 2.5 % w/v. When a combination of estradiol cypionate and medroxyprogesterone acetate is the active ingredient of the pharmaceutical preparation of the invention, the amounts of such compounds present in the pharmaceutical preparation are substantially as here above.<br>
Concentrations of exemestane in the formulation can range from about 1% w/v to about 25% w/v, preferably from about 5% w/v to about 20% w/v. The steroidal biologically active compound is preferably in milled or micronized form according to the common practice.<br>
The pH controlling activity of L^Methionine either alone or in combination with a conventional buffer is showtfrfor instance by the following examples.<br><br>
Example t<br>
pH stabilization of a parenteral aqueous suspension of Exemestane (CAS: 6-Methylenandrosta-I,4-diene-3,17'dione; other name: Androsta-l,4-diene-3,17-dione-6-methylene) by means of L-Methionine.<br>
Exemestane is an irreversible aromatase inhibitor, structurally related to the natural steroid androstenedione and it is a molecule prone to oxidation. When performing an experimental study, by adding different antioxidants to a 10% Exemestane parenteral aqueous suspension we have surprisingly found out that L-Methionine can stabilize the pH of the suspension. In fact, the experimental data provided in Table 3 clearly demonstrate that in the suspension formulation containing L-Methionine the pH reduction is minimized in comparison with the "as is" and that by adding L-Methionine, the pH of the suspension is stabilized at values above pH 4.5 even after 2 months storage at 55Â°C.<br>
What is outmost surprising is that among the added antioxidants, only Methionine is effective in substantially controlling/stabilizing the pH of the suspension (after 2 months storage at 55Â°C the pH decrease of the formulations containing ascorbic acid, and sodium metabisulfite is in fact comparable or worse than the one experimented in the "as is" formulation).<br>
Therefore a simple antioxidant effect cannot explain the result obtained and the presence of a specific stabilizer, such as L-Mettiionine, is needed in order to prevent a dramatic pH decrease and stabilize the parenteral aqueous suspension. The present invention, however, is not intended to be limited to any particular theory of the exact mechanism of this substantial pH stabilization but relates to the fact that a substantial pH stabilization is obtained, to the unconventional way through which this substantial pH stabilization is obtained and to its possible advantages. It is an advantage of the present invention tiiat the pH of these stabilized parenteral aqueous suspensions does not dramatically decrease during storage but, on the contrary, is maintained closer to the initial value (i.e. closer to neutrality) and therefore these stabilized suspensions can be safely administered without generating significant pain on patients-<br><br>

Example 2<br>
pH and technological quality (re-suspendability, syringeability) stabilization of a<br>
medroxyprogesterone acetate parenteral aqueous suspension by means of L-Methionine<br>
used alone or in combination with low and unconventional concentrations of phosphate<br>
buffer.<br>
As previously shown in Table 2, the use of a conventional buffering agent, such as<br>
Phosphate buffer, in usual effective concentrations (approx. 1%) in order to stabilize<br>
\hs. pH of a medroxyprogesterone acetate aqueous suspension has a detrimental effect<br>
on the suspension technological quality, i.e. resuspendability and syringeability.<br>
In this example, outUned in Table 4 (Tables 4a and 4b), it is evident that the pH of the<br>
same type of suspension can be controlled/stabilized by using L-Methionine alone or<br>
by a combination of L-Methionine with  a lower and unusual  concentration of<br>
phosphate buffer (approx. 0.1 %). In fact, when L-Methionine is used alone, as in the<br>
case of batch 13451/47-1, a substantially stabilized pH is obtained.<br>
Besides, when L-Methionine is used in combination with a low unusual concentration<br>
of Phosphate buffer (approx. 0.1%) a synergistic effect is obtained.<br>
In fact, as clearly shown in the case of batch 13451/47-C, when an unusually low<br>
concentration   of  phosphate  buffer  (approx.   0.1%)  is  used,   no  significant  pH<br>
stabilization is obtained vs. the "as is" formulation.<br><br>
On the contrary, when the same low unusual concentration of phosphate buffer (approx. 0.1%) is used in combination with L-Methionine, as in the case of batch 13451/84-D, a surprising super-additive effect is obtained in controlling/stabilizing the pH of the formulation.<br>
Besides, when L-Methionine is used alone or in combination with a low unusual<br>
amount of phosphate buffer, no negative effect is produced on the suspension's<br>
technological quality, thus allowing the achievement of a pH stabilized<br>
medroxyprogesterone acetate suspension with good re-suspendability and<br>
syringeability properties that are maintained during storage.	r   â€”<br>
On the contrary, when a usual effective concentration of phosphate buffer (approx. 1%) is used in order to stabihze the pH, as in the case of batch 13451/47-0, a detrimental effect on the physical stability of the formulation is obtained.<br>
It is an advantage of this invention that the pH of parenteral aqueous suspensions can be substantially stabilized without using effective usual concentrations of conventional buffering agents, i.e. typically inorganic or organic acid salts, thus avoiding some substantial drawbacks, such as the profound effects caused by ionic species, and especially by polyvalent ions, on the nature and the stability of flocculated suspensions, with detrimental effects on suspension le-suspendabiUty and syringeability.<br>
Table 4: pH, resuspendability and syringeability study of a 20% Medroxyprogesterone Acetate (MPA) parenteral aqueous suspension formulated with different amounts of L-Methionine and Phosphate buffers.<br>
Suspension composition:<br>
MedroxyprogesteroneAcetate 20%, MyristylGammaPicoliniumChloride 0.1% (batch 13451/84) or 0.2 % (batch 13451/47), sodium sulphate 1.1%, PEG 3350 2.03%, sodium hydroxide q.s. to pH 6.5 , WFI q.s to 100 ml.<br><br><br><br>
Example 3<br>
pH stabilization of a medroxyprogesterone acetate and estradiol cypionate parenteral aqueous suspension by means of L-Methionine used alone or in combination with unconventional low amounts of phosphate buffer.<br>
Estradiol cypionate and medroxyprogesterone acetate is an esEro-progestinic combination that is used in contraception. Both estradiol cypionate and medroxyprogesterone acetate are quite stable molecules and no relevant degradation is reported when the two actives are formulated as a parenteral aqueous suspension. In fact, no particular stabilizers are requested to chemically stabilize the two active ingredients molecules, being the only issue to be solved is their hydrophobicity and Uierefom the need to use suitable wetting/suspending agents in order to obtain a re-<br>
I<br>
suspendable and syringeable suspension. In the experimental trial reported in Table 5, a 1% estradiol cypionate and 5% medroxyprogesterone acetate parenteral aqueous suspension, containing suitable wetting/suspending agents has been formulated with different amounts of L-Methionine and with a combination of L-Methionine and a low<br><br>
and unusual concentration (approx. 0.1%) of Phosphate buffer. From the data obtained, not only L-Methionine "per se" is capable to prevent the relevant pH decrease occourring to the "as is" formulation and to maintain the pH of the formulation well above 4.5 even after 1 month storage at 65Â°C, but, most surprisingly, when used in combination with an lower and unconventional amount of phosphate buffer (approx. 0.1% or 0.0066M), the pH is stabilized to values close to the lime zero value. Besides, the stabilizing effect is similar to the one obtained by buffering the formulation with a usual effective concentration (approx. l%or0.066M) of phosphate buffer. It is an advantage of this invention that the pH of certain parenteral aqueous suspensions can be stabilized without buffering the formulation with a conventional buffering agents (i.e. inorganic/organic acid salts) or without usual effective concentrations of a conventional buffering agent.<br>
As said before, the pH stabilized parenteral aqueous suspensions obtained by means of this invention do not contain conventional buffering agents or usual effective concentrations of buffering agents. As a consequence, a further advantage of this invention is that the so obtained parenteral aqueous suspensions do not have buffering capacity or significant buffering capacity per se, and therefore, when injected, the pH of the product can be more easily adjusted to the physiological value by the buffering capacity of the.tissue fluids.<br>
