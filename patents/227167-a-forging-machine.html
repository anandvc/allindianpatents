				<td>FORGING MACHINE HAVING INTERMITTENT FEEDING MECHANISM<br>
This invention relates to a forging machine, more<br>
particularly to an intermittent feeding mechanism of a<br>
forging machine.<br>
Referring to Figure 1, a conventional forging machine<br>
includes a machine body 11 with a feeding opening 111, a<br>
reciprocating mechanism 12 which is driven by a main drive<br>
unit inside the machine body 11 and which can control the<br>
frequencies of the periodic motions of the components<br>
included in the forging machine, a feeding mechanism 13<br>
driven by the reciprocating mechanism 12 to advance a feed<br>
material 10, a cutting mechanism 14 to cut the feed material<br>
10, and a punching mechanism 15 to press and form the<br>
workpieces cut from the feed material 10 by the cutting<br>
mechanism 14. The punching mechanism 15 includes a front<br>
punching mechanism 151 and a rear punching mechanism 152<br>
which are respectively provided with complementary male<br>
and female dies 153. The punching mechanism 15 further<br>
includes a clamp mechanism 154 to convey the workpieces.<br>
Each workpiece undergoes a continuous process that employs<br>
a series of dies to press the workpieces stage by stage<br>
to form final products.<br>
During the pressing operations of the punching mechanism<br>
15, each male die must work at a predetermined speed with<br>
sufficient punching force so as to permit smooth forging<br>
of the final products . The punching force provided for each<br>
male die 153 may be calculated by dividing an overall<br><br>
operating power supplied to the punching mechanism 15 by<br>
the number of the male dies 153. Since the overall operating<br>
power and the number of the male dies 153 are fixed, the<br>
punching force for each male die 153 is also fixed. Thus,<br>
the forging machine is suitable only for producing products<br>
of one kind having the same forgeability.<br>
For example, if the overall operating power of a forging<br>
machine is 1200 tons and if the number of the die assemblies<br>
thereof is six, the punching force for each male die would<br>
be 200 tons. Such a forging machine is not suitable for<br>
forming a product that requires a punching force of 400<br>
tons unless the number of the male dies thereof is reduced<br>
to three. Otherwise, another forging machine having an<br>
operating power of 2400 tons must be provided to produce<br>
the product.<br>
As described above, the conventional forging machine<br>
has low adaptability to various forged products, and can<br>
be used only for a few kinds of products.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a forging<br>
machine with an adjustable intermittent feeding mechanism<br>
so that the adaptability of the forging machine to various<br>
forged products may be increased.<br>
Accordingly, a forging machine of the present invention<br>
includes a cutting mechanism, a roller feed unit for<br>
advancing intermittently a feed material to the cutting<br>
mechanism, a feed drive shaft for driving the roller feed<br>
unit, a punching mechanism, a punch drive shaft for driving<br><br>
the punching mechanism, a reciprocating link for<br>
transmitting a driving force to the feed drive shaft and<br>
the punch drive shaft, the forging machine being<br>
characterized by: a driven arm connected coaxially to the<br>
feed drive shaft and extending radially from the feed drive<br>
shaft, the driven arm being turnable between a first position<br>
and a second position and driving the feed drive shaft<br>
whenever the driven arm turns from the first position to<br>
the second position; a swing unit driven by the reciprocating<br>
link, the swing unit being connected coaxially to the punch<br>
drive shaft for driving the punch drive shaft and including<br>
a first crank plate which extends radially from the punch<br>
drive shaft to the feed drive shaft, the first crank plate<br>
being reciprocated by the reciprocating link to perform<br>
a cycle motion, the first crank plate driving the driven<br>
arm from the first position to the second position; and<br>
a returning unit for returning the driven arm to the first<br>
position from the second position, the returning unit being<br>
movable in a cycle motion and being controllable to change<br>
an interval of time between two successive cycles of the<br>
cycle motion of the returning unit.<br>
Other features and advantages of the present invention<br>
will become apparent in the following detailed description<br>
of the preferred embodiment of the invention, with reference<br>
to the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>

machine;<br><br>

Fig. 7 is another elevation view showing the rear portion<br>
of the forging machine of Fig. 2; and<br>
Fig. 8 is a block diagram showing how a returning unit<br>
of the forging machine of Fig. 2 is controlled.<br>
Referring to Figure 2, there is shown a forging machine<br>
embodying the present invention which includes a machine<br>
body 3 having a feed inlet opening 31, a feeding mechanism<br>
2 to advance a feed material 20, a reciprocating mechanism<br>
41 driven by a main drive unit 4 0 provided inside the machine<br>
body 3, a cutting mechanism 5, and a punching mechanism<br>
6. The cutting mechanism 5 and the punching mechanism 6<br>
are actuated by the reciprocating mechanism 41 so as to<br>
synchronize with each other. The reciprocating mechanism<br>
41 includes a reciprocating link 411. The punching<br>
mechanism 6 includes a front punching mechanism 61 and a<br>
rear punching mechanism 62. The front and rear punching<br>
mechanisms 61, 62 are provided with complementary male and<br><br>
female dies 63. A clamp mechanism 64 is provided for<br>
conveying workpieces between the male dies 63 and from the<br>
cutting mechanism 5 to the male dies 63 during intervals<br>
between two successive punching motions of the punching<br>
mechanism 6.<br>
Referring to Figures 3 and 4, the feeding mechanism 2<br>
is disposed at a rear side of the machine body 3 adjacent<br>
to the feed inlet opening 31. The feeding mechanism 2<br>
includes a swing unit 21 driven by the reciprocating link<br>
411/for synchronous movement therewith, a feed drive unit<br>
23 driven by the swing unit 21, a returning unit 22 disposed<br>
above the feed drive unit 23 for returning the feed drive<br>
unit 23, and a roller feed unit 24 actuated by the feed<br>
drive unit 23.<br>
The swing unit 21 is connected coaxially to a punch drive<br>
shaft 211 which is used to actuate the punching mechanism<br>
6 so that the punch drive shaft 211 and the punching mechanism<br>
6 are synchronized with the swing unit 21. Since the punching<br>
mechanism 6 is known, it is not detailed hereinafter.<br>
The swing unit 21 includes a sleeve portion 210 sleeved<br>
around the punch drive shaft 211, a first crank plate 213<br>
extending radially and rearwardly from the sleeve portion<br>
210, and a second crank plate 212 extending radially and<br>
downwardly from the sleeve portion 210. The first and second<br>
crank plates 213 and 212 are angularly spaced apart from<br>
eachother. The second crank plate 212 is connected pivotally<br>
to the reciprocating link 411.<br><br>
The feed drive unit 23 is disposed at the rear side of<br>
the machine body 3 and includes a feed drive shaft 232,<br>
a driven arm 231 driven by the first crank plate 213 and<br>
connected coaxially to the feed drive shaft 232, and a drive<br>
gear 233 attached to the feed drive shaft 232 for synchronous<br>
movement therewith. The driven arm 231 has a sleeve 2311<br>
sleeved around the feed drive shaft 232 and is turnable<br>
between a first position or a lower limit point (P) to a<br>
second position or an upper limit point (Q). The drive<br>
gear 233 is used to drive the roller feed unit 24.<br>
Referring to Figure 7 in combination with Figures 2 and<br>
3, the roller feed unit 24 includes four rollers 241 to<br>
advance a feed material 20, and four driven gears 242 which<br>
are driven by the drive gear 233 and which are attached<br>
respectively to four shafts 243. Since the roller feed unit<br>
24 does not form any part of the present invention, the<br>
construction thereof is not described further hereinafter.<br>
The returning unit 22 includes a telescopic device which<br>
is movable to execute an extension stroke and a retraction<br>
stroke over a cycle motion. In this embodiment, the<br>
returning unit 22 includes a gas cylinder 221 mounted on<br>
a top wall of the machine body 3, and a piston rod 222 extending<br>
outwardly from the gas cylinder 221 and connected pivotally<br>
to the driven arm 231.<br>
The returning unit 22 is controllable to change or adjust<br>
an interval of time between two successive cycles of the<br>
cycle motion of the returning unit 22. For example, the<br><br>
interval of time may be adjusted to be equal to a period<br>
of time that the first crank plate 231 takes to complete<br>
one cycle of its cycle motion (i.e. a two-stroke cycle<br>
consisting of a forward stroke and rearward stroke).<br>
Referring to Figure 8, the returning unit 22 maybe controlled<br>
through a control unit which may include a sensor (S), a<br>
counter (C ) and a solenoid valve (V). The sensor (S) may<br>
be disposed proximate to the first crank plate 213 to detect<br>
the cycle motion of the first crank plate 213. The counter<br>
(C ) may be any suitable type of counter. The solenoid valve<br>
(V) may be connected to the gas cylinder 221 and may be<br>
controlled through the sensor (S) and the counter (C ) to<br>
regulate the supply of gas to the gas cylinder 221. The<br>
controlling of the returning unit 22 is explained by way<br>
of example hereinafter.<br>
When the reciprocating link 411 performs a first cycle<br>
of reciprocating motion, the cutting mechanism 5, the<br>
punching mechanism 6 and the swing unit 21 each go through<br>
one cycle of reciprocating motion. The count of the counter<br>
(C ) is "0" before the motions of the reciprocating link<br>
411, the cutting mechanism 5, the punching mechanism 6 and<br>
the swing unit 21. When the first crank plate 213 of the<br>
swing unit 21 turns clockwise to execute a first rearward<br>
stroke of its cycle motion, the driven arm 23 is moved upward<br>
from the lower limit point, i.e. the first position (P)<br>
(see Fig. 4) to the upper limit point, i.e. the second posit ion<br>
(Q) (see Fig. 5), and the count of the counter is "1." In<br><br>
response to this counting signal of the counter (C), the<br>
solenoid valve (V) is closed so that no gas is supplied<br>
to the gas cylinder 221. At this time, the piston rod 222<br>
is in a retracted position, the roller feed unit 24 advances<br>
the feed material 20 a predetermined distance, the cutting<br>
mechanism 5 cuts the advanced feed material 2 0 to form a<br>
workpiece, and the workpiece is sent to a first one of the<br>
female dies 63 to be pressed by the front punching mechanism<br>
61.<br>
When the first crank plate 213 executes a forward stroke<br>
(counterclockwise) as shown in Figure 6, the driven arm<br>
231 does not move because the solenoid valve (V) of the<br>
returning unit 22 is not actuated. The pressure in the gas<br>
cylinder 221 is therefore controlled such that the piston<br>
rod 222 is kept in a retracted state and such that the driven<br>
arm. 23 is stopped at the upper limit point (Q). Thus, the<br>
first crank plate (213) is moved away from the driven arm<br>
231.<br>
When the first crank plate 213 executes a rearward stroke<br>
for a second time, the cutting mechanism 5, the punching<br>
mechanism 6 and the swing unit 21 are actuated once again.<br>
However, since the driven arm 231 is at the upper limit<br>
point (Q), the first crank plate 213 swings idly so that<br>
the feed drive shaft 232 and the roller feed unit 24 are<br>
not actuated. Therefore, the cutting mechanism 5 moves idly,<br>
and no workpiece is picked up by the clamp mechanism 64<br>
from the cutting mechanism 5. The clamp mechanism 64 conveys<br><br>
the workpiece from a first one of the female dies 63 to<br>
a next female die 63. As the first crank plate 213 executes<br>
the rearward stroke in the second time, the count of the<br>
counter is "2. " The counter is reset to "0" after the count<br>
of "2." At this time, the solenoid valve (V) is opened<br>
to supply gas to the gas cylinder 221 so that the piston<br>
rod 222 extends and pushes the driven arm 231 to move clockwise<br>
from the upper limit point (Q) to the lower limit point<br>
(P) where the driven arm 231 contacts the first crank plate<br>
213 once again. When the driven arm 231 moves clockwise,<br>
the driven arm 231 does not actuate the feed drive shaft<br>
232 because a unidirectional bearing (not shown) is provided<br>
between the driven arm 231 and the feed drive shaft 232<br>
to control the feed drive shaft 232 to move in a single<br>
direction.<br>
As mentioned above, the returning unit 22 stops motion<br>
at an interval of time between two successive cycles of<br>
its cycle motion. The interval of time is equal to the period<br>
of time that the first crank plate 213 takes to complete<br>
one cycle of its cycle motion.<br>
When the first crank plate 213 executes the rearward<br>
stroke for the third time, the driven arm 231 is moved once<br>
again from the lower limit point (P) to the upper limit<br>
point (Q). Therefore, the driven arm 231 completes one cycle<br>
whenever the first crank plate 213 completes two cycles.<br>
Since the roller feed unit 24 is driven by the driven arm<br>
231 and since the punching mechanism 6 is driven by the<br><br>
first crank plate 213, the roller feed unit 24 advances<br>
the feed material 20 one time whenever the punching mechanism<br>
6 executes its punching stroke two times. As the cutting<br>
mechanism 5 is synchronized with the punching mechanism<br>
6, the cutting mechanism 5 will idle one time when no feed<br>
material 20 is advanced to the cutting mechanism 5. As such,<br>
the workpiece will be supplied to every other one of the<br>
female dies 63 of the punching mechanism 6 from the cutting<br>
mechanism 5 so that the number of the female dies 63 which<br>
receive the workpieces is half of the total number of the<br>
female dies 63. When the number of the female dies 63 that<br>
receive the workpieces is reduced, the punching force<br>
received by the workpiece in each female die 63 may be<br>
increased.<br>
In case the total number of the female dies 63 is six<br>
and the total operating power provided for the punching<br>
mechanism 6 is 1200 tons, the workpiece in each of six dies<br>
63 would receive a driving force of 200 tons. If the punching<br>
mechanism 6 is to produce a product that requires a driving<br>
force of 400 tones, the number of the dies 63 to receive<br>
the workpieces may be reduced to half of six, i.e. three,<br>
so that the driving force distributed to each female die<br>
63 may be doubled. Such a reduction may be done by adjusting<br>
the returning unit 22 such that the interval of time between<br>
two successive cycles of the returning unit 22 is equal<br>
to a period of time that the first crank plate 213 takes<br>
to complete one cycle, as explained hereinbefore.<br><br>
If the number of the female dies 63 to receive the<br>
workpieces is to be reduced to one third of the total number<br>
of the female dies 63 (i.e. two), the interval of time of<br>
the returning unit 22 may be adjusted to be equal to a period<br>
of time that the first crank plate 213 takes to complete<br>
two cycles. As such, the driving force distributed to the<br>
workpiece in each female die 63 may be increased three times.<br><br>
