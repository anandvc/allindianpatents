FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The hydraulic machine, which converts the mechanical energy into Hydraulic energy is known hydraulic machine. The hydraulic energy is in the form of Pressure energy. Hydraulic machines such as centrifugal pump, jet pump, submersible pump, etc.need a prime mover. Where as this siphon pumping is an innovative pump that can pump the Fluid without using any prime mover as in hydraulic Ram. This siphon pumping uses the difference in elevation between the two levels of reservoir to pump the fluid. The main difference between the Hydraulic ram and siphon pumping is there in no relatively moving part in siphon pumping. PRIOR OF ART<br>
Siphon system was generally used to transfer the fluid from higher reservoir to lower reservoir. In all siphon system all fluid will finally flow below the level of higher reservoir to lower reservoir, whereas in this siphon pump we made some amount of fluid to get collect in tank from the siphon system, which will be above level of higher reser\'oir.<br>
The following tabulation will explain about the difference between siphon pump and other related type of patent.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
and olhcr gaseous comes out of water and it get collected at point y and slops siphoning process. Therefore the height elevation of point y is resistricted to certain level. FACTORS CONTROLLING SIPHONING:<br>
./	The main factor that controlling the siphoning process-&gt;is the head<br>
elevation (h). Depending upon the head losses due to friction losses and minor losses,<br>
velocity of fluid wills change. This can be determined from the following derivation.<br>
From fig .1<br>
Applying Bernoulli's equation between Xrand z	^   -,<br>
(Px/g'p) + (V\'/2g) +Z X = (Pz /gp) + (V^z/2g) + Z z + losses of head from x to Z Px - P z ^atmospheric pressure = 0; V x = V z Therefore the equation will become<br>
Z X - Z z== Head losses from x to Z<br>
h= Head losses from x to Z	.<br>
There will be one major loss due to frictional flow and number of minor losses depending upon OUF set up. Knowing all the sources of minor losses, frictional factor (0, length of pipe (1) and diameter (d) we can calculate its velocity from the following equation.<br>
(4flvV2gd) + minor losses = Ah	equation 1<br>
Thus from the above equation we can calculate the velocity of fluid in the siphon. Now applying the Bernoulli's equation between x and y<br>
(Px /g p) +( V^x /2g) + Zx^{?y /g p) + (V^Y /2g) + Z y + losses of head from XtoY<br>
Px = atmospheric pressure; V y =V x ; P y = minimum pressure i. e. 2.83 meters of water column; Z x=0<br>
10.33 + 0 + 0 = 2.83 -f 0 -f Z y + losses from x to Y<br>
8.5 -losses from x to Y = Z y	equation 2<br>
By calculating al! the losses by knowing the velocity o^ lluid from the cqu-iiion 1 and substituting in equation 2 we can And the value of Z y i.e. the maximum height that the fluid can be lifted williout cavitations<br><br>
SIPHON PUMPING:<br>
From the concepts of fluid flow in siphon we can understood that the fluid can be raised to certain height from the water level (tank a)while when it flowing from high pressure to low pressure. Although the maximum height is resistricted if we could able to store the water at that critical point (y), we can pump the water to certain height without using any external agencies. Pressure point is point where the minimum pressure exits in siphon normally it will be at the maximum height from the raising portion i.e. point 'y'in ^ figure 1.Pressure height is maximum height that the water can be lifted Theoretically pressure height can be up to 8.33 meters of water column absolute. But practically with losses it can be lifted near to it but it cannot reach because it will start cavitations.<br>
There can be two cases with Low head and high head.	When here is<br>
low head then there will be low velocity of fluid in siphon and low frictional losses therefore there will be more pressure height but the discharge will decrease similarly when the head increases there will be high velocity more frictional losses therefore we will get lesser pressure height but there will be more discharge. Here we are using the fluid itself to pump the fluid to high level this could avoid the usage of an prime mover to pump the fluid. SIPHON TO SIPHON PUMP<br>
Previously from "fluid flow in siphon" we had seen that we can raise the fluid to certain height by simple siphoning process and we can able to store the fluid by means of following set up of pump. In this set up we are going to keep a collecting tank (3) which is completely closed, at the critical point (y) to store the fluid. Intially there will be some amount of air will be inside the collecting tank (3), when we remove the air inside the tank (3) then the fluid will get collected in it, from siphon tube. DESCRIPTION OF WORKING MODEL<br>
REFERE FIG. 2. First the collecting tank (3) open to atmosphere so that it will have air only inside. Some amount of water is poured in lo collecting tank nearly 6 limes the suction tube (2) through the opening at the top of collecting tank (3) which has btop valve (10) for opening and closing of it. Now it is then closed. Since because of foot valve (1) and stop valve (6) water will not flow out of the tank. Now the suction tube (2) and delivery tube (5) is full of water. Then Ihe tank is completely closed so now<br><br>
collecting tank (3) is having some amount of water and air, now this air column have to be removed to fill with waier, to do that a venturimeter (7) is placed in the position at the positive pressure column (Ahi). The throat of venturimeter (7) is connected to the air column in the collecting tank (3) through, a small tube called as By pass tube (4).<br>
WORKING:<br>
When the stop valve (6) in the delivery tube (5) is opened gradually water will start flowing through delivery tube (5), since the collecting tank (3) is completely closed vaccum will be created in the collecting tank (3) so that atmospheric pressure will push the water from tank 'a' to collecting tank (3), through suction tube (2) and the process of Siphoning will get start<br>
Since the venturimeter (7) have to be placed in positive pressure column (Ahi). there will be low-pressure will created in the throat of venturimeter (7) due to fluid flow in it. since we had connected the air column of collecting tank (3) to the throat of venturimeter (7) through By pass tube (4) there will be difference in pressure will be created between them. This pressure difference will suck the air in t-he collecting tank (3) towards the throat of venturimeter (7). From the venturimeter (7) the sucked air will get ejected towards down in delivery tube (5).<br>
Thus the air in the collecting tank (3) will be removed slowly, depending upon the amount of air is removed water gets collected in collecting tank (3). Thus after some time all the air in collecting tank (3) will be removed and it will be replaced by water. After all the air is removed stop valve (6) is closed to stop the siphoning. Thus now we had stored water in the collecting tank (3) it can be used any purpose. To restart the process again care must be taken some amount of water must be kept in the tank (3) as for priming purpose.<br>
To take the water out of collecting tank (3) through the stop valve (11), we have to close the stop valve (9) and open valve (8) for air flow inside while we are taking water of tank (3). Similarjy at the time pump working we have to close the stop valve (8) and wc have to open the valve (9) for air tlov/ from collecting tank (3) to venturimeter v7)-<br><br>
CALCULATION:<br>
The following reading has been taken from the prototype model of siphon pump -<br>
venturi type.<br><br>
Diameter of the suction tube and delivery tube is 25.4mm Ratio of venturimeter inlet to throat is 1:2 Capacity of collecting tank is 6 liter SIGNIFICANCE OF DIAMETER VARIATION<br>
We need the collecting tank (3) to be placed in the maximum height from the suction level (tank a) ,so we have to reduce the friction losses in the siphon system(refer equation 1&amp;2). For that if we keep the diameter of suction tube (2) as twice or thrice that of delivery tube (5) to reduce head losses in suction tube (2). Reason why we are not keeping the delivery tube (5) diameter as less is get required pressure to develop  to  suck  air  in  the  collecting  tank(3).   From  the  continuity  equation  of incompressible flow we know that vl= velocity of fluid in suction tube a1= area of cross section in suction tube v2= velocity of fluid in delivery tube a2= area of cross section in delivery tube<br>
al*vl = a2*v2<br>
n*r1'^2*v1= n*r2^-2*v2<br>
rlA2*v1       =   r2^^2*v2 v1 =v2 (r2/r1)'^2<br><br>
if r1 = 2r2	v1 = (v2/4)<br>
if r1 = 3r2	v1 = (v2/9)<br>
Thus because of change in diameter between suction tube and delivery lube of thrice will reduce veiocity by 9 times in suction tube, than when they arc of same diameter.<br>
Similarly wc know formula for frictional losses is<br>
(Pl*vV2gd) = Ah	'<br>
Therefore Trom the frictional losses equation, head losses will also<br>
decrease by square when velocity decreases.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
(Pl/2gd)*v^= Ah<br>
v = (vl/9)	(f^l/2gd)*vl^*(l/81) - Ah<br>
MULTI STAGING<br>
This siphon pump can be connected in series to pump fluid to for higher height. The output of one pump can be connected to another pump. Likewise number of pump that can connected in series, it has no limitation for the number of stages that can be connected in series, till there is fluid in previous stage next stage is there. This is an important feature of siphon pump. The way by which it can be connected in series is shown in fig3.<br>
Water collected in collecting tank (3) of pump (1) is stored in auxiliary tank (AI), which will act as suction tank for pump (2),-the out coming water from the delivery tube of pump (2) is connected to suction tank (a) of pump (1) to re-circulate the water in pump I. So that to pump again. The performance of all pumps and its working will same in each stage remain same.<br>
