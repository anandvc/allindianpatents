"An Improved Media for Arsenic Removal from Water"<br>
Thermax Limited<br>
with Corporate office at Thermax House, 4 Pune-Mumbai Road, Shivajinagar, Pune<br>
411005, Maharashtra, India.<br>
an Indian Company registered under the provisions of the Companies Act, 1956,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed: -<br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to media for removal of Arsenic from drinking water.<br>
In particular, the present invention relates to synthesis and use of media for removal of Arsenic from drinking water.<br>
More particularly, the present invention relates to synthesis and use of Arsenic removal media having redox properties, which is capable of removing both major types of inorganic Arsenic from ground water, more efficiently and without any pre-treatment such as oxidation etc.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Arsenic is naturally occurring element in earth crust i.e. in rocks, soils, minerals and ores. Water which comes in contact with such deposits often gets contaminated with dissolved form of Arsenic. Arsenic contamination in some areas gets elevated as a result of erosion from local rocks and dissolution from soil &amp; ores. Arsenic is widely used in metallurgy, glassware, ceramic, dyes, herbicides and pesticides, refining, wood preservative and fertilizer industries. Effluents from such industries are also responsible for high Arsenic levels in nearby water bodies. Problem of high Arsenic levels in ground water is more predominant in eastern states of India and in almost all parts of Bangladesh. Arsenic levels in these areas are as high as few thousands of ppb.<br>
Arsenic contaminated drinking water poses the biggest threat to public health as Arsenic is recognized as highly toxic and poisonous element for centuries and it can contribute to long term morbidity and mortality. United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) has maintained 10 micrograms/lit as maximum contamination level (MCL) for Arsenic in drinking water.<br>
2 <br>
Arsenic is present in nature in either organic form or in inorganic form. Organic Arsenic is mostly present in seafood but it is much harmless as it can be easily discarded by human body. Inorganic Arsenic is much poisonous to body and it is mostly present in two anionic forms in nature. Trivalent Arsenic [As(III)] is called as 'Arsenite' whereas 'Arsenate' is pentavalent Arsenic [As(V)]. In the pH range of 4-10, trivalent Arsenic is present as neutral species whereas pentavalent Arsenic is present as anionic or negatively charged species. Maybe due to this reason, pentavalent Arsenate is much easy to remove than trivalent arsenite by any conventional technique of Arsenic removal. Due to toxic and poisonous nature of Arsenic, it is therefore very important to develop a cost effective and efficient solution for removal of Arsenic from water that is used for domestic purpose, especially which goes for human consumption.<br>
Removed Arsenic from ground water can become a solid source for Arsenic, which is widely and mostly used in synthesis of wood preservatives and herbicides apart from various other industrial processes mentioned above. World demand for Arsenic trioxide, which is used as a major raw material, is about 100000 metric tons/year. At present, almost all Arsenic trioxide is obtained from residues of mineral processing such as flue dust from sulfide smelting.<br>
At present, many systems for Arsenic removal from ground water are fully developed and commercially available. These systems are mainly based on different techniques namely coagulation followed by precipitation, adsorption, membranes and ion exchange.<br>
Effective removal of Arsenic can be achieved by coagulation with ferric salts followed by precipitation or similar conventional Iron-Manganese removal processes. However such processes are not suitable for small projects due to high costs and want of trained operators. Effective separation of precipitate from treated water is also critical and important and needs close monitoring by well-trained personnel. Disposal of large volumes of contaminated sludge is one of the major drawbacks of this technique.<br>
3<br><br>
Adsorption of Arsenic on activated alumina is simpler but less effective technique. Though it removes arsenate very effectively, removal of arsenite is very poor. This leads to overall low Arsenic removal capacity of media. Generally alumina is used as non-regenerable media meant for one time use only. Due to this, disposal of spent media is also one of the major problems with this technique. Presence of other anions in water such as phosphates and sulfates can also seriously hamper the Arsenic capacity of alumina.<br>
Granular ferric oxides / hydroxides (GFO and GFH) are also used for removal of Arsenic and works on adsorption technique. Though Arsenic removal capacities of these media are far better than alumina, problems arising due to their incapability of regeneration still remain with GFO and GFH. It is mentioned that disposal of spent media is safe and secure as adhered Arsenic can not leach out under normal environmental conditions. However, leaching of Arsenic may occur due to changing global environment especially due to frequent occurrences of phenomena of 'acid rain'.<br>
Usage of reverse osmosis and nano-filtration membranes for Arsenic removal is also reported. However, this option is not commercially accepted for drinking water application due to high operational costs. Since these membranes are subjected directly to raw water, there is a threat of organic / inorganic fouling. To avoid this fouling, suitable pre-treatment and periodic maintenance with chemicals is necessary. This increases the overall application costs further. It has also got another disadvantage of high water rejections as compared to other conventional methods. In this technique, Arsenic is not getting bound and complexed to any type of solid matrix but it gets concentrated in reject water and remains in same soluble and dangerous form. Disposal of reject water is another area of concern for this technology.<br>
Since Arsenic is present in anionic form in water, it is possible to remove it by using anion exchange resin. However simple resin does not offer any selectivity towards Arsenic and presence of other anions such as chloride, fluoride, sulfate, phosphate etc greatly hamper the overall capacity of resin for Arsenic removal. Since arsenite is present as a neutral<br>
4<br><br>
species, removal of the same with anionic resin is virtually zero. Due to these drawbacks usage of simple anion exchange resin for removal of Arsenic is not popular.<br>
Among all these technologies, GFO / GFH seems to be the most popular one despite of its inability for usage in repeated cycles and lot of research has been done using these media for removal of Arsenic from ground water. Most probable reason for its wide use is its high capacity of overall Arsenic removal and also a substantially higher ability to adsorb arsenite as compared to other media. Research paper titled 'Comparative studies for selection of technologies' by J. C. Saha et al, 'Granular ferric hydroxide for elimination of Arsenic from drinking water' by B. N. Pal and 'Arsenic removal from drinking water using granular ferric hydroxide' by O. S. Thirunavukkarasu et al discuss the usage of various media for Arsenic removal, superiority of GFO / GFH over other media, ability of GFO / GFH to remove arsenite effectively and also their ability to achieve MCL of 10 micrograms/lit Arsenic in drinking water. Only disadvantage of this media looks like its inability of regeneration and repeated cycle use.<br>
Recently, researchers have come up with a new type of Arsenic removal media having GFO / GFH precipitated inside a solid spherical ion exchange resin matrix. This media offers all advantages of GFO / GFH of Arsenic removal. In addition, it is best suitable for column operations due to spherical shape. Crosslinked polymer matrix of resin provides the substrate durability to the media and reduces the chances of loss of media due to attrition. It is possible to elute Arsenic from spent media, regenerate it and use it in multiple cycles leading to reduced cost of operation.<br>

An U.S. patent application No. 2006037913 describes the art of precipitating a metal like iron inside the anion exchange resin. Metal ion in form of an anionic complex is first loaded on anion exchange resin and then the said metal is precipitated as metal hydroxide inside the resin by alkali treatment. Anion exchange resin modified in this fashion by precipitation of iron oxide can be effectively used for removal of Arsenic from ground water.<br>
However, such media may show less capacity for removal of arsenite ions and may need oxidation with Chlorine or Ozone as a pre-treatment, which oxidizes arsenite into arsenate. Installation of such pre-treatment will certainly increase the overall application cost. Hence it was felt that there is a need to develop such a media which will effectively remove both forms of Arsenic from water without any pre-treatment of oxidation and provide effective, efficient and commercially feasible solution to the problem of Arsenic removal.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>

8<br><br>
Another object of this invention is to develop a media which can effectively remove both forms of Arsenic viz. arsenite and arsenate from water.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to develop an ion exchange based media which can remove both forms of Arsenic from water and which does not need any pre-treatment of oxidation.<br>
Yet another object of this invention to develop an anion exchange resin based media for removal of both forms of Arsenic and which also have in-built redox properties that can effect in-situ oxidation of arsenite into arsenate.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to develop above mentioned media from which loaded Arsenic from spent media can be easily eluted and recovered, resin can be regenerated and use in multiple cycles.<br>
Another objective of this invention is to develop low cost, robust Arsenic removal media having all above mentioned qualities and which can provide an effective, efficient and commercially feasible solution to a problem of Arsenic removal from water.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Present invention relates generally to the development and usage of anion exchange material based Arsenic removal media which iron hydroxide is precipitated inside the resin material and which also contains manganese dioxide based functionality which can catalyze oxidation reactions.<br>
Improved Arsenic removal media presented in this invention is synthesized by first loading the Iron in the form of anionic complex into the semi-dried anion exchange resin in chloride form followed by its precipitation under strong oxidative environment.<br>
9<br><br>
The said anion exchange resin in this case can be of any type such as gel, isoporous or macroporous. Though strong base anion exchange resin is preferred for this modification, weak base resin in hydrochloride salt form can also be used. The said anion exchange resin may have crosslinked polystyrene, polyacrylic or any other suitable matrix. Synthesis of such resins is well known art and the same has been already reported in number of references and patents.<br>
The said ion exchange material can be in the form of spherical shaped beads, granules, flakes, membranes etc.<br>
Particle size of resin may vary from 25 microns to 1400 microns. However the preferred size is 300-1200 microns.<br>
Use of semi-dried resin is recommended for loading metal ion as presence of water decreases the stability of the complex between metal ion and resin, which lead to less loading of metal ion inside the resin. Though Iron is preferred as a metal to be precipitated inside the resin, other metals capable of adsorbing Arsenic such as Titanium, Manganese etc can be used.<br>
The loaded metal is then precipitated inside the resin by alkali treatment under strong oxidative condition. This can be achieved by using alkaline permanganate solution, which also gives the media ability to catalyze oxidation reaction.<br>
Alkali used can be any alkali metal or alkaline earth metal hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide etc.<br>
Thus, the present invention proposes the development of improved media for Arsenic removal comprising the following steps.<br>
1.  Reducing the moisture content of anion exchange resin by suitable method,<br>
10<br><br>
2.	loading of metal having Arsenic removal property in the form of anionic complex, onto anion exchange resin material,<br>
3.	Treatment of metal loaded resin with alkaline permanganate solution which precipitate the metal inside the resin and also introduces oxidative properties into resin,<br>
4.	Final washing of media with demineralized water to remove traces of adhered chemicals.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the process of synthesis of improved Arsenic removal media based on anion exchange resin wherein a metal like iron is precipitated as ferric hydroxide inside the resin and which also have functionality which can exhibit oxidation potential.<br>
As mentioned earlier, metal like iron is first loaded onto anion exchange resin in the form of anionic species and it forms complex with the resin. It is a well known fact that metal like iron can form tetrachloride complex (FeCl4-1) in presence of high chlorides and under acidic pH. This tetrachloride complex bears negative charge and thus easily gets loaded onto anion exchange resin replacing exchangeable chloride ion already present on the resin to form a metal - resin complex.<br>
For higher loading of metal on the resin it is therefore very important that stability of complex between metal and resin should be high. Stability of this complex increases proportionally with the acidity of environment. Hence, the stability of complex may reduce if the acidity of environment reduces. Presence of water in the environment reduces the its acidity which in turn reduces the stability of complex and finally amount of metal loading also decreases. Thus, usage of semi-dried resin is recommended for higher loading of metal ion onto resin. Totally dry resin will have highest metal loading but it is generally avoided as total drying of resin followed by re-wetting with water may decrease the physical strength of<br>
11<br><br>
resin and may even affect bead integrity especially in case of gel and isoporous resin. Treatment with saturated brine solution or air drying of resin can reduce moisture content of resin to make it suitable for metal loading.<br>
In this invention, metal loading was carried out by equilibrating Tulsion A-23, which is gel type strong base anion exchange resin in chloride form, with a solution of ferric chloride, sodium chloride and hydrochloric acid for suitable period. It was found that amount of metal loaded onto the resin is directly equivalent to the total exchange capacity of resin and also it is the maximum threshold value for metal loading. As mentioned earlier, iron is loaded as FeCl4-1 on the resin by replacing original exchangeable chloride ion. So the maximum amount of iron that can go on resin is decided by total exchange capacity of resin and can not exceed even if you use very high quantities of Ferric chloride and other chemicals.<br>
In the next step of invention, metal loaded resin is filtered out and directly treated with a solution of sodium hydroxide and potassium permanganate. It is strongly recommended that washing of metal loaded resin by water or any other solvent should not be done as it may elute the loaded metal from the resin.<br>
Sodium hydroxide provides the necessary alkaline medium in which iron can get easily precipitated. Presence of Permanganate in this precipitation serves various purposes. Firstly it provides the strong oxidative environment that ensures precipitation of iron as ferric hydroxide only, which is responsible for Arsenic adsorption. Traces of any residual ferrous ions can get oxidized into ferric ions during precipitation.<br>
As loaded iron gets precipitated, resin regains its chloride ionic form. In presence of<br>
permanganate ions, some of the chloride ions are replaced by permanganate due to higher<br>
selectivity. Thus ionic form of resin becomes a mixed one i.e. chloride and permanganate.<br>
   This loaded permanganate is capable of catalyzing oxidation reactions and it can increase the<br>
oxidation state of many elements such as iron and Arsenic.<br>
12<br><br>
When such a resin is put into use for Arsenic removal, the loaded permanganate ions can catalyze oxidation of As(III) into As(V). Thus, pre-treatment of ozone / chlorine oxidation is not required in case of this modified resin. As mentioned earlier, adsorption of As(V) is more easy, fast and effective than As(III). It is desirable that maximum As(III) should get oxidized into As(V) so that overall capacity of media for Arsenic removal will increase. Probable mechanism of this oxidation can be as follows.<br>
When a resin in permanganate form comes in contact with water containing other anions, every anion will compete with each other for getting loaded onto the resin. Since selectivity of permanganate ion will be highest due to its high molecular weight and high concentration as compared to other common anions in ground water, it will ultimately remain on resin. However for a short time period, it will be in equilibrium with competing anion and during this period, it will be present as free permanganate ion. During this period it will regain its oxidative property, will catalyze necessary oxidation of As(III) to As(V), then go back to the resin and get loaded onto it. Thus, there will not be any permanent leaching of permanganate from resin or even consumption of it as it will only catalyze the oxidation without taking part in reaction.<br>
There is one more possibility by which this permanganate can increase overall capacity for Arsenic removal. Since the media will be used for treating ground water, it will be subjected to many more ions along with Arsenic. Most common ion that can appear in ground water is iron. Iron in water is present in Fe(II) for which is the soluble form of iron. Loaded permanganate on media can oxidize soluble Fe(II) ions in water to insoluble Fe(III) form and precipitate it in form of iron oxide flakes in the resin bed. This ferric hydroxide can also act as adsorbent for Arsenic and thus enhance overall efficiency of the media for removal of Arsenic.<br>
During synthesis of media, enough time has to be given for reaction to occur between metal loaded resin and solution of sodium hydroxide and potassium permanganate so as to<br>
13<br><br>
ensure complete precipitation of ferric hydroxide and also replacement of chloride ions on resin by permanganate ions. Finally resin media is separated by filtration and washed with demineralized water till the effluent is free of any alkalinity and permanganate. Resultant media can be directly used for removal of Arsenic from water. One way to use this media for removing arsenic from water is by filing a column with the media and passing water through such column so that the arsenic is absorbed by this media.<br>
The synthesis of media can be carried out in a batch mode under stirring or in continuous mode by column operation.<br>
As mentioned earlier, this improved media is regenerable and can be used for multiple cycles. Loaded Arsenic in spent resin can be easily eluted along with loaded metal by acid treatment. Arsenic from the eluent can be recovered. Eluted resin can be subjected to similar steps such as brine treatment for reducing moisture, metal loading, precipitation by alkaline permanganate solution and final washing to get back the original media.<br>
