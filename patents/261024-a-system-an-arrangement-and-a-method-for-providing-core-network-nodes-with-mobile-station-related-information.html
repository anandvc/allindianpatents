FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a system for providing a core<br>
network node with location related information about one or more<br>
mobile user stations accessing the core network over an access<br>
network. The invention also relates to a network node for a<br>
communications system supporting communication of packet data and<br>
also to a core network node for a communication system supporting<br>
communication of packet data which acts as a gateway node to external<br>
or third party controlled communications systems or service<br>
providers. Still further the invention relates to a method for<br>
providing a second core network node acting as a gateway to external<br>
or third party controlled data communications systems, with location<br>
related information of one or more mobile user stations accessing the<br>
core network over an access network.<br>
STATE OF THE ART<br>
In today known systems core network nodes, such as for example GGSNs<br>
(Gateway GPRS Support Node), do not have sufficient knowledge of<br>
where mobile stations actually are located. It is for example known<br>
that GGSNs are provided with location information through so called<br>
CGI/SAI (Cell Global Identifier/Service Area Identifier) from for<br>
example SGSNs (Serving GPRS Support Nodes). Today CGI/SAI information<br>
is sent to a GGSN when a mobile user station (MS), e.g. a User<br>
Equipment (UE) is moving from an old SGSN to a new SGSN. Often,<br>
however, said information in SGSN/GGSN is not worth so much, since<br>
the accuracy is not good due to the fact that a mobile user station<br>
may be involved in several handovers at cell level while still being<br>
connected to one and the same SGSN, i.e. there may be several<br>
handovers at cell level before the SGSN is notified (or there is a<br>
change of SGSNs) . Thus, in for example PLMNs (Public Land Mobile<br>
Network) supporting GPRS services (GSM Packet Radio Service) the<br>
precise and actual location of an MS or an UE is not known, neither<br>
by the SGSN nor by the GGSN providing the service. The SGSN does have<br>
location information, but it only has information that is provided to<br>
it, which however has a limited granularity and/or a limited<br>
timeliness. The reason therefore is, as referred to above, that the<br>
MS/UE may move within a routing area without informing the SGSN. The<br>
occasions when the SGSN may report the location of the MS/UE to the<br><br>
GGSN are few, basically at PDP context establishment in the SGSN.<br>
Today PLMN operators for example tend to apply Packet Switched (PS)<br>
mobile access charging in a GGSN where they apply differentiated<br>
rates depending on the service provided. Thus it is a problem with<br>
today known solutions among others as far as charging is concerned.<br>
An operator who wants to apply different rating, for example<br>
depending on the location of an MS/UE, will face the problem that the<br>
location information is not available in the GGSN or that it is not<br>
accurate or timely enough.<br>
If the Gn interface between the SGSN and the GGSN would be elaborated<br>
to report location changes, this would involve several drawbacks.<br>
First, such an approach would lead to intensive signalling between<br>
the SGSN and GGSN still without any possibility to adapt to the<br>
requirements that can be derived from the rating. Moreover the<br>
location granularity would be the same for all MSs/UEs and thus the<br>
report triggering would be the same for each MS/UE.<br>
For several implementations, for example, relating to charging but<br>
also for several other implementations or services the information as<br>
to the location or the location at a given time is not sufficient in<br>
for example a core network node such as a GGSN and all today known<br>
solutions to increase the accuracy etc. of application information<br>
all suffer from the drawback that it requires a lot of signalling and<br>
all mobile user stations (here meant MSs and/or UEs or, more<br>
generally, mobile user stations) are treated completely equally as<br>
far as location related information is concerned.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
What is needed is therefore a system as initially referred to in<br>
which the provisioning of location related information to core<br>
network nodes is provided for in an easy and flexible manner.<br>
Particularly a system is needed through which the accuracy of<br>
location related information can be increased in core network nodes,<br>
particularly in core network nodes acting as gateways to external<br>
networks or third party controlled communication systems. Furthermore<br>
a system is needed through which different degrees of accuracy of<br><br>
location related information can be provided for different mobile<br>
user stations, i.e. that allows controllability.<br>
Moreover a system is needed through which location related<br>
information can be provided to core network nodes in a more timely<br>
manner than hitherto. Yet further a system is needed through which<br>
location related information can be provided to core network nodes<br>
without, or at least without considerably, increasing the signalling<br>
in the system. Particularly a system is needed through which<br>
different kinds of user location related information can be provided<br>
to core network nodes and, advantageously also to operators and<br>
service providers or users of third party controlled communication<br>
systems. Particularly a system is needed through which the accuracy<br>
of CGN/SAI in for example an GGSN can be increased. Particularly a<br>
system is needed through which location dependent charging is enabled<br>
in a better and more flexible party manner than hitherto. Most<br>
particularly a system is needed through which packet switched traffic<br>
rating which is location dependent on a per mobile station basis is<br>
allowed. Particularly a system is needed through which it gets<br>
possible to collect location information with the appropriate<br>
location (and timing) related accuracy in order to perform for<br>
example adaptive charging or rating or adaptively and flexibly<br>
providing services.<br>
A (core) network node as initially referred to is also needed through<br>
the use of which one or more of the above mentioned objects can be<br>
achieved. Still further a core network node acting as a gateway, as<br>
also initially referred to, is needed through the use of which one or<br>
more of the above mentioned objects can be achieved. Still' further a<br>
method as initially referred to is needed, through which one or more<br>
of the above mentioned objects can be achieved.<br>
Therefore a system as initially referred to is provided which<br>
comprises a number of radio access network nodes, such as for example<br>
RNCs (Radio Network Controller), BSCs (Base State Controller), BTSs<br>
(Base Transceiver Station, Node-B, UNCs (Unlicensed Network<br>
Controller), access points or wireless access gateways of for example<br>
wireless LANs, a number of first (core) network nodes serving<br><br>
communication of data such as for example SGSNs, MSCs (Mobile<br>
Switching Centers), PDGs (Packet Data Gateways) or intermediate<br>
interworking gateways to for example a WLAN, a number of second core<br>
network nodes comprising gateway core network nodes, for example<br>
GGSNs, acting as gateways to external or third party controlled data<br>
communication networks and/or service providers, whereby location<br>
related information of one or more mobile user stations, for example<br>
mobile stations or user equipment, or more generally any mobile user<br>
station, obtained from the radio network access nodes, is provided<br>
from a first (core) network node to a second core network node.<br>
According to the inventive concept, location related information is<br>
provided in one or more dedicated information elements added to<br>
existing communication of messages between said first (core) network<br>
node and said second core network node. The core network may comprise<br>
3G system such as an UMTS or a GPRS/GSM, with an access network such<br>
as UTRAN, GERAN with access network nodes, or an Unlicensed Mobile<br>
Access Network (UMA).<br>
In one implementation location related information about one or more<br>
mobile user stations is provided from radio access network control<br>
nodes to the first (core) network node automatically or according to<br>
a known procedure. The location related information may also be<br>
provided, for one or more user stations, upon request by the first<br>
(core) network node, which then may indicate for which particular<br>
mobile user station(s) location related information is to be provided<br>
and even more particularly when or under which circumstances, e.g.<br>
for mobile user stations fulfilling certain criteria.<br>
Particularly, a request from a first (core) network node or some<br>
other node can be defined so as to refer to one or more specific<br>
mobile user stations. Even more particularly the request can be<br>
defined so as to refer to one or more mobile user stations fulfilling<br>
one or more given criteria.<br>
Particularly the location related information comprises information<br>
about the actual geographical location of a number of mobile user<br>
stations on a given level, e.g. cell level, RA (Routing Area) level,<br>
sub-cell level or service area level. The location related<br><br>
information may also or additionally comprise information about the<br>
time zone in which a mobile user station currently is located,<br>
preferably for mobile user stations for which a change of time zone<br>
is plausible, i.e. which are located there where change of time zone<br>
can be expected to occur. In one particular embodiment the first<br>
(core) network node uses the Location Report Control procedure to<br>
request location related information of a given mobile user station.<br>
However, the location related information may also be requested in<br>
other manners.<br>
The dedicated information element or elements is/are, in a most<br>
advantageous implementation, added to or included in the user plane<br>
traffic messages, i.e. to the payload sent from a first core network<br>
to a second " core network node for the mobile station or stations<br>
concerned, or even all. In another implementation the dedicated<br>
information element(s) is/are added the user plane messages<br>
concerning such mobile user stations for which the first core node<br>
has requested location related information only.<br>
In another embodiment the dedicated information element or elements<br>
is/are added to existing messages comprising update PDP context<br>
requests or similar from a first (core) network node to a second core<br>
network node for all mobile user stations handled by said first core<br>
network node or for those mobile user stations only for which the<br>
first core network nodes has requested location related information.<br>
Also other existing messaging could be used for adding the<br>
information element(s) containing location related information.<br>
In one particular implementation the location related information<br>
comprises charging related information such as for example CGI/SAI<br>
information. Particularly means are provided for adaptive location<br>
information provisioning to a second core network node from' the first<br>
(core) network node.<br>
Said means particularly comprises a client in the second core network<br>
node. Even more particularly said client comprises an LCS (Location<br><br>
Services) Client for requesting and collecting differentiated<br>
location related information.<br>
Therefore also a (core) network node as initially referred to is<br>
provided which comprises means for establishing for which mobile user<br>
stations location related information is to be collected from the<br>
access network over which said mobile user stations are connected to<br>
said core network, and means for collecting and means for storing<br>
said location related information and means for providing location<br>
related information to a second core network node acting as a gateway<br>
to external or third party controlled communication systems or<br>
service providers. Said means for establishing, collecting and<br>
providing location related information may consist of common control<br>
means, or may be constituted of different, separate, cooperating or<br>
intercommunicating means.<br>
Particularly the first (core) network node comprises an SGSN, a node<br>
acting as a gateway to a wireless access network, particularly a<br>
packet data gateway, PDG, or any other corresponding node.<br>
Even more particularly the node comprises means for providing said<br>
location related information in one or more dedicated information<br>
elements which may be the same means as the means for providing the<br>
location related information to a second core network node, or means<br>
separate there from. Said means for providing the location related<br>
information particularly comprises means for adding said information<br>
element to all payload traffic, i.e. all messages sent on the user<br>
plane of the established mobile user stations, e.g. using the GTP-U<br>
tunnel. Particularly said information is added to all traffical<br>
messages sent from mobile user stations for which the core network<br>
node has requested Location Report Control or for which a core<br>
network node (or any other node or means) has requested location<br>
related information in any other way, or more generally, for which<br>
location related information is to be provided.<br>
The core network node even more particularly comprises (control)<br>
means, in an alternative embodiment, for adding said information<br>
element or elements to messages sent to the second core network node<br><br>
when the location related information has changed for the mobile user<br>
station, e.g. when the mobile user station has changed geographical<br>
area, service area, cell and/or time zone.. Said messages particularly<br>
comprise so called Update PDP Context Requests.<br>
The invention also suggests a core network node for a communications<br>
system supporting communication of packet data which acts as a<br>
gateway node to external or third party controlled communications<br>
system or service providers, which comprises means for receiving and<br>
collecting location related information for mobile user stations from<br>
a first core network node, as discussed above. Said means comprises<br>
control means for, based on specified criteria, enabling adaptive<br>
collection of location related information for mobile user stations<br>
for which the specified criteria are met, and for enabling adaptive<br>
reporting of such location related information to external or third<br>
party controlled data communications systems or service providers.<br>
Said node particularly comprises a GGSN. Said criteria are<br>
particularly mobile user station location related, i.e. they may<br>
relate to the geographical location of the mobile user station, which<br>
then determines whether from that particular user station, where it<br>
is located, location related information is needed when it e.g. moves<br>
to another cell or to another service area or to another time zone.<br>
The collected location related information particularly • comprises<br>
geographical location information and said control means particularly<br>
comprises a LCS client allowing adaptive collection of location<br>
related information on a per mobile user station basis. Particularly<br>
means are provided for transferring said location related information<br>
to a GMLC (Gateway Mobile Location Center). It may however be any<br>
kind of node or center having a functionality similar to that of a<br>
gateway mobile location center. Particularly means are provided for<br>
transferring said location related information to a GMLC allowing<br>
for, for example, adaptive location based service provisioning or<br>
adaptive location based charging.<br>
Converting means for converting	collected location related<br>
information to another format,	particularly to a format<br>
understandable to the third party	controlled data communication<br>
system or service provider may be	provided in the first (core)<br><br>
network node, in the second core network node, e.g. a GGSN, according<br>
to different implementations.<br>
The invention therefore also discloses a method as initially referred<br>
to, which comprises the steps of; establishing at least for which<br>
user stations location related information is to be collected in a<br>
first (core) network node; collecting said location information for<br>
said mobile user stations; storing said location related information<br>
in storing means in or associated with said first (core) network<br>
node; arranging said location related information in dedicated<br>
information elements; and adding said information elements to<br>
messages sent independently of said information element(s) from said<br>
first (core) network node to the second core network node. That the<br>
messages are sent independently of said information element means<br>
that already existing messaging between first core network node and<br>
the second core network node is used for transfer of said information<br>
element(s). The dedicated information element may be added to all<br>
traffical packets sent in the user plane for the concerned mobile<br>
user stations or it may alternatively be added to other messages,<br>
e.g. in the control plane, such as Update PDP Context Requests. In an<br>
advantageous implementation it additionally comprises the step of<br>
converting, in said first or said second core network node, said<br>
location related information to a format understandable to users of<br>
said third party controlled data communications network or external<br>
service providers or more general to any desired format unless it is<br>
already in a desired format.<br>
Most particularly the method comprises the step of; adaptively<br>
reporting location related information such as location information,<br>
time zone information etc. to allow for location dependent rating or<br>
service provisioning on a per mobile user station basis. The location<br>
information may be on different levels, e.g. on cell level, service<br>
area level or any other appropriate level. It may particularly<br>
comprise geographical coordinates or it may be converted to such. The<br>
location information may also alternatively or additionally comprise<br>
time zone information.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention generally relates to providing a core network<br>
node, generally denoted a second network core (CN) node, particularly<br>
a GGSN, with location related information for one or more mobile user<br>
stations, e.g. mobile user stations for which location related<br>
information has been requested, for all mobile user stations or for<br><br>
mobile user stations fulfilling one or more given criteria e.g. as<br>
far as location is concerned. The location related information can be<br>
of different kinds as will be more thoroughly discussed below, for<br>
example pure location information, e.g. indicating geographical area,<br>
on different levels or in different forms, for example on cell level,<br>
service area level or geographical coordinates or any other form to<br>
specify an area, but it may also comprise information about in which<br>
time zone a mobile user station currently is located. It may also be<br>
different or on different levels etc. for different mobile user<br>
stations. The inventive concept is applicable to 3G (Third Generation<br>
Partnership Project) systems, e.g. UMTS based on WCDMA (Wideband Code<br>
Division Multiple Access) technologies as well as to other systems<br>
and to other access networks, for example WLAN (Wireless Local Area<br>
Network) inter working with 3G and Unlicensed Mobile Access (UMA)<br>
etc.<br>
Fig. 1 is a schematical block diagram of a first example of an<br>
implementation to a 3G UMTS system built on the WCDMA technology<br>
architecture. In a simplified manner is illustrated a routing area RA<br>
comprising three cells, cell A, cell B, cell C in which a mobile user<br>
station or a user equipment MS is moving around, in this particular<br>
case it is supposed that it moves from cell A to cell B. Cell A is<br>
here via a base station BS lAlf controlled by RNC (Radio Network<br>
Controller) or BSC (Base Station Controller) 2AX whereas cell B via<br>
base station BS lBi and cell C via base station BS ICx are controlled<br>
by RNC/BSC 2BX. RNC/BSC 2&amp;x here connects to the core network by means<br>
of first CN node SGSN 1 3Alf whereas RNC/BSC 2BX is connected to first<br>
CN node SGSN 2 3Bi. Both SGSN 1 3AX and SGSN 2 3hx communicate with<br>
second CN node GGSN (Gateway GPRS Support Node) 4X. It should be clear<br>
that this is merely a simplified illustration and the inventive<br>
concept is also among other applicable to pooling concepts as for<br>
example described in "Communication system supporting^ wireless<br>
communication of packet data and method and arrangement relating<br>
thereto" filed by the same applicant on October 13, 2000 and which<br>
herewith is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
It is in this embodiment supposed that MS moves from cell A to<br>
cell B. It is in this particular case supposed that the SGSN has<br><br>
requested that location related information be provided for MS. When<br>
MS moves from cell A to cell B, information as to that is provided<br>
from BS 1BX to RNC/BSC 2Bx, which hereupon provides such location<br>
related information to SGSN 2 3BX. In Figure 1 control means are<br>
illustrated in SGSN 1 and SGSN 2 respectively which here are supposed<br>
to handle establishment of for which mobile stations location related<br>
information should be provided and to handle collection of such<br>
information from the RNC/BSC in question and further to provide for<br>
storing of such location related information in a database DB, for<br>
example an existing database in the SGSN holding location information<br>
for all subscribers, e.g. the MM context data database (Mobility<br>
Management database) or in a specific database or a database<br>
associated with SGSN. The control means are also responsible for<br>
making sure that the location related information is provided to<br>
GGSN, i.e. the relevant location related information is thus fetched<br>
from the database when sending of a message (e.g. a traffical packet<br>
in the user plane) to SGSN is due. In the particular embodiment<br>
illustrated in Fig. 1, it is supposed that the control means also are<br>
responsible for providing the location related information in a new<br>
(dedicated) information element (IE) which is sent in the User Plane,<br>
i.e. over GTP-U (GPRS Tunneling Protocol-User plane). The relevant<br>
information element(s) is/are thus added to traffic payload sent from<br>
MS via SGSN 2 to GGSN and hence added to all messages for the<br>
particular user, in this case MS. The SGSN control means are used to<br>
add the dedicated information element(s) to all messages particularly<br>
by extending the GPP-U header with the location related information.<br>
In an alternative, advantageous, implementation only one (or a<br>
limited number of) GTP-U packet is extended with location information<br>
each time the UE changes e.g. cell or RA. This is advantageous in<br>
that it eliminates redundant information sent to GGSN and in that it<br>
minimizes processing time in GGSN to handle the embedded location<br>
information in the GTP-U packet. Even if there is a slight risk that<br>
a single GTP-U packet gets lost, the benefit should outweight this<br>
risk.<br>
.In Fig. 1 it is further illustrated that converting means are<br>
provided in GGSN 4X. The converting means are used to convert the<br>
location related information of the dedicated information element IE<br><br>
to a format understandable to a third party communication system<br>
connected to GGSN, for example Internet, or to external service<br>
providers etc. These converting means are not necessary for the<br>
functioning of the inventive concept but generally it is desirable to<br>
be able to provide the location related information in an appropriate<br>
form to allow for example for service providers to offer services<br>
etc. The converting means could also have been provided in SGSN 2<br>
(and SGSN 1). When the interface between RNC/BSC and SGSN in Iu (i.e.<br>
not Gb), GTP-U may be used to convey the location information in the<br>
same manner as on the Gn-interface. When using GTP-U the GGSN will<br>
only receive updates of location of UEs when they are active. That<br>
is, when the user is using some PS based service. Many times when a<br>
user is moving, he is not using any PS service at all, and hence the<br>
GGSN will fail to be updated. This problem can be solved in for<br>
example the following way: Every time an SGSN or RNC/BSC becomes<br>
aware that a UE has changed Cell (or RA) , it updates its DB with the<br>
new location and searches for any GTP-U communication of the UE to<br>
convey its location to the next CN node. If no GTP-U communication<br>
(packets) are found within a certain time (a timer Tl may e.g. be<br>
set) , the node generates a GTP-U packet itself "on behalf of" the UE<br>
and forwards this to the next CN node. The location information is<br>
inserted in this generated GTP-U packet. The IP packet which is<br>
encapsulated in the GTP-U packet may be constructed in such a way<br>
that it is discarded by the GGSN. It may for example be a PING<br>
message which GGSN will not answer, or with a faulty destination<br>
address e.g. 0.0.0.0 that the GGSN will have to discard. This<br>
generated "dummy" packet will convey the location information to the<br>
GGSN at a very low cost, and still use the same concept as if GTP-U<br>
communication is present.<br>
The timer can be set to a reasonable high value, e.g. minutes, to<br>
avoid frequent updates e.g. for UEs which are moving fast on a<br>
highway and quickly moving between cells. Depending on how the<br>
location information is used by receiving applications, UEs only<br>
staying a very short time in a cell may not be of interest. The timer<br>
Tl could hence be reset every time the UE moves to a new cell or RA.<br>
4<br><br>
It should be clear that in this embodiment the information element<br>
could alternatively have been included in an Update PDP Context<br>
Request as sent from SGSN 2 to GGSN 4X for example whenever MS changes<br>
the geographical area, which is detected via SGSN which then sends<br>
the updated location related information to GGSN in a new information<br>
element added to an Update PDP Context Request instead. However, the<br>
first solution relating to sending information elements in the user<br>
plane minimizes the amount of signalling which is extremely<br>
advantageous.<br>
Fig. 2 shows another implementation of the inventive concept. It is<br>
also here supposed that routing area RA comprises three cells, cell<br>
A, cell B, cell C. Here mobile user station MS moves from t cell B to<br>
cell C and BS 1A2 covers cell A, BS 1B2 covers cell B, whereas BS 1C2<br>
covers cell C. BS 1A2 is controlled by RNC/BSC 2A2 whereas BSs 1B2, 1C2<br>
are controlled by RNC/BSC 2B2. RNC/BSC 2A2 is here connected to first<br>
CN node SGSN 1 3A2 whereas RNC/BSC 2B2 is connected to first CN node<br>
SGSN 2 3B2. SGSN 1 and SGSN 2 communicate with GGSN 42, i.e. the<br>
second CN node. Like in the preceding embodiment, described with<br>
reference to Fig. 1, it is supposed that the first CN nodes SGSN 1<br>
and SGSN 2 comprise control means and a database respectively.<br>
However, in this embodiment it is illustrated that converting means<br>
are provided in SGSN 1 and SGSN 2 respectively. In this particular<br>
implementation it is also supposed that GGSN 42 comprises an LCS<br>
client (Location Services). The LCS client particularly allows<br>
collection of location information required for e.g. rat.ing to be<br>
properly differentiated based on location. The LCS client is defined<br>
in 3GPP TS 23.271,- section 6.3.2, which herewith is incorporated<br>
herein by reference. The LCS client can also be responsible for<br>
collecting location related information in the form of time zone<br>
information etc. The inclusion of an LCS client is however not<br>
necessary for the basic concept of the present invention but it<br>
merely discloses an advantageous implementation, (and requires a GMLC<br>
as will be explained below). Moreover, an LCS client as will be more<br>
thoroughly described below with reference to figures 13, 14 and 15<br>
might alternatively be included in a GGSN without the implementation<br>
of the dedicated information element sent using already existing<br><br>
messaging for provisioning of location related information to a GGSN,<br>
i.e. relying on the GMLC (cf. e.g. Figs. 13-15).<br>
As referred to with reference to Fig. 1 also the converting means are<br>
not necessary for the functioning of the inventive concept, but if<br>
such are provided, they may, as in Fig. 1, be included in the GGSN<br>
instead.<br>
Thus, in Fig. 2 it is supposed that BS 1C2 provides location related<br>
information to RNC/BSC 2B2 which in turn forwards said location<br>
related information concerning MS to the control means of SGSN 2 3B2,<br>
which for example explicitly may have requested location related<br>
information for MS. In other aspects the functioning is similar to<br>
that described with reference to Fig. 1 and SGSN 2 provides the<br>
location related information to, here, the LCS client of GGSN 42. Also<br>
without inclusion of this LCS client in GGSN, the location related<br>
information would of course be provided to GGSN 42. This transfer is<br>
via GMLC, which provides the information to the LCS client in the<br>
GGSN. The GMLC may process and/or convert the location information as<br>
required to meet the demands from the LCS client's client (e.g. the<br>
charging framework) . The GMLC may use the SGSN or MSC to collect<br>
location information, and uses the options of the Lg interface to<br>
optimize the data collection. The GMLC may even collect GPS data from<br>
an MS that supports GPS positioning. In the illustrated embodiment a<br>
PDP Context Update Request is used as existing messaging, and to<br>
which a dedicated information element is added as discussed with<br>
reference to Fig. 1. Of course, alternatively the information element<br>
might have been added to the user (traffic) plane messages, i.e. the<br>
user packets from MS.<br>
Fig. 3 shows an embodiment in which the inventive concept is used in<br>
a system with an Unlicensed Mobile Access network (UMA). The<br>
functioning is similar to that described above with the reference to<br>
the Figs. 1 and 2 with the difference that the access network<br>
comprises an UMA with an access point 1C controlled by an Unlicensed<br>
Network Controller UNC 2C which functions substantially in the same<br>
manner as an RNC. The UNC 2C communicates with a first CN node SGSN 3<br>
3C over the Gb/Iu interface and here with an MSC over the A/Iu<br><br>
interface. The MSC in turn communicates with a RAN for circuit<br>
switched communication. Also RAN communicates with the first CN node<br>
SGSN 3 3C. As the MS moves, location related information is provided<br>
to the control means of SGSN 3 3C as described with reference to for<br>
example Figs. 1 and 2. SGSN 3 3C stores the location related<br>
information in a database DB for forwarding to the second core node<br>
GGSN 1 42 in a dedicated information element IE. It is of course also<br>
here possible to either extend the traffic payload messages with the<br>
location related information dedicated information element in all<br>
traffical packets from the MS for which location related information<br>
should be provided to e.g. GGSN 1 42 or alternatively to add one or<br>
more dedicated information elements to Update PDP Context Requests.<br>
Assuming that the Gb/Iu or A/Iu supports location based services<br>
(LCS), i.e. having an LCS client in the GGSN, is possible here as<br>
well. In order to indicate that both methods can be used, the<br>
transfer to GGSN 1 42 merely is indicated as location related IE in<br>
the figure. In other aspects the functioning is similar to that<br>
described above. Converting means may optionally be provided in<br>
SGSN 3 3C or GGSN 2 42.<br>
Fig. 4 describes still another an embodiment in which the inventive<br>
concept is implemented in a system or an architecture in which a WLAN<br>
interworks with a 3G system. In this embodiment it is illustrated how<br>
location related information about an MS is provided from a WLAN AP<br>
ID to a wireless local area network access gateway WAG 2D which<br>
forwards the information to a packet data gateway PDG 3D which, even<br>
if it actually does not belong to the core network, here is referred<br>
to as a first (CN) node, similar to an SGSN, which therefore contains<br>
the control means and the database as discussed above according to<br>
Figs. 1-3 with reference to SGSNs. The PDG then transfers the<br>
location related dedicated IEs to the second CN node GGSN 43. Also in<br>
this case the dedicated information element or elements IE could be<br>
added to all traffical packets from the concerned MS, or the<br>
dedicated IE could be added to PDP Context Update Requests from PDG<br>
3D to GGSN 43. Converting means (not shown) may optionally be included<br>
in PDG 3D and/or GGSN 43.<br><br>
Fig. 5 shows still another example of an implementation in which a<br>
WLAN interworks with a 3G system. In this case, however, it is<br>
supposed that an interworking gateway node 2E communicates with an<br>
SGSN, a first CN node 3E with control means and database as discussed<br>
above which thus forwards location related information either in the<br>
user plane included in all traffical packets from MS -or as an<br>
additional information element added to an Update PDP Context Request<br>
sent from SGSN 3E to GGSN 44. The location related information about<br>
the MS is thus forwarded from WLAN AP IE to the interworking gateway<br>
node 2E. In all the embodiments described with reference to Figs. 3-<br>
5, any converting means could optionally be provided either in SGSN<br>
or PDG or in GGSN.<br>
Fig. 6 shows a dedicated location related information element IE<br>
according to the invention to be sent in the user plane, i.e. over<br>
GTP-U. This means that an SGSN (or a PDG or similar) includes this<br>
information for all messages towards a GGSN from a particular user if<br>
the SGSN has requested the provisioning of location related<br>
information as far as that user is concerned, particularly if the<br>
SGSN has requested location reporting control for that user. In an<br>
alternative embodiment it could be done for all users. More generally<br>
it can be controlled in any manner for which users reporting should<br>
apply and SGSN does not necessarily have to explicitly request<br>
information. Requests could also originate from other nodes or<br>
external means etc., or it can be seen as a request if an MS fulfills<br>
some predefined criteria, i.e. is located in an area, in which<br>
provisioning of location related information is wanted for whatever<br>
reason.<br>
This means that SGSN to the GTP-U header adds an extension header<br>
including e.g. user location, particularly a new CGI information<br>
element in all (or one or a limited number only) user plane packets<br>
towards the GGSN in one particular embodiment. This gives GGSN<br>
accurate location information since particularly, according to one<br>
embodiment every cell change will be visible to the GGSN, in case<br>
location information is requested on cell level. It should be clear<br>
that different kinds of location related information can be requested<br>
and provided to GGSN, on different levels, in different forms or for<br><br>
example as time zone information. This method enables very high<br>
accuracy and minimizes the signalling load as compared to the<br>
alternative in which dedicated information elements are added to<br>
Update PDP Context Requests.<br>
Packets from an MS in the direction towards the external network are<br>
hence encapsulated and tunneled from the SGSN to the GGSN by the GPRS<br>
Tunnelling protocol GTP. In this particular embodiment an- extension<br>
header, including a new, also called dedicated, information element,<br>
which in one implementation is a so called CGI information element,<br>
is added to the GTP header. This is done in the user plane, GTP-U,<br>
and hence the SGSN includes the location related information in all<br>
packets towards the GGSN as mentioned above. As can see from the<br>
figure a GTP-U packet comprises a GTP-U header as is conventional,<br>
but in addition thereto it is provided with an extension header<br>
including for example a user location information element. In a more<br>
particular embodiment it may also comprise an MS time zone<br>
information element. The packet also comprises the user payload, i.e.<br>
the user packet coming from the MS. Examples on user location<br>
information elements and time zone information elements will be given<br>
with reference to Figs. 8,9,10,11,12A,12B. Of course also other types<br>
of information elements are possible, there might be more information<br>
elements and the structure may be different and therefore these<br>
examples should not be seen in a limitative perspective.<br>
Fig. 7 is a sequence diagram illustrating an embodiment in which the<br>
dedicated information element is added to an Update PDP Context<br>
Request. Whenever, for example, a mobile station or a user equipment<br>
(UE) has changed geographical area, this will be detected by the SGSN<br>
(or PDG) which sends the updated coordinates to the GGSN in a<br>
dedicated (new) information element which is added to an Update PDP<br>
Context Request, the Inter SGSN Routing Area Update procedure is<br>
described in 3GPP TS 23.060, ch. 6.9.1.2.2. In the sequence diagram<br>
of Fig. 7, the dedicated information element, particularly a CGI<br>
information element, is added to the Update PDP Context Request<br>
message 6 sent from SGSN 2 to GGSN. In other aspects the signalling<br>
sequence is similar to that described in the above mentioned<br>
standard.<br><br>
Thus, it is supposed that an MS sends a Routing Area Update Request<br>
to a new, here called a second SGSN 2, 1. SGSN 2 subsequently sends<br>
an SGSN Context Request to the old SGSN 1 to get MM (Mobility<br>
Management) and PDP Contexts for the MS, 2. SGSN 1 responds with an<br>
SGSN Context Response to SGSN 2, 2. Optionally security functions may<br>
be executed, 3. SGSN 2 then sends a SGSN Context Acknowledgement<br>
message to SGSN 1. This message informs the first SGSN 1 that the<br>
second SGSN 2 is ready to receive data packets belonging to the<br>
activated PDP Context, 4. SGSN 1 duplicates buffered N-PDUs (Packet<br>
Data Units) and starts tunnelling them to SGSN 2, 5. SGSN 2 then<br>
sends an Update PDP Context Request with the new SGSN address,<br>
(address of SGSN 2) TEID, QoS negotiated, and user location related<br>
information of any kind, for example also including mobile station<br>
time zone, to the concerned GGSN. The GGSNs then update PDP Context<br>
Fields and return Update PDP Context Response to SGSN 2. The location<br>
related information provides information for example about the<br>
geographical location of a mobile station. It may also (or only)<br>
include time zone information as to in which time zone the mobile<br>
station currently resides, 6. Subsequently SGSN 2 informs the HLR<br>
about the SGSN change by sending update location to HLR, 7, and HLR<br>
sends a cancel location to SGSN 1, 8. The HLR then sends Insert<br>
Subscriber Data (IMSI International Mobile Subscriber Identity etc.)<br>
to SGSN 2 which validates the presence of the MS in the (new) RA<br>
etc., 9. The HLR subsequently acknowledges the Update Location by<br>
sending an Update Location Acknowledgement (IMSI) to SGSN 2, 10.<br>
Subsequently SGSN 2 validates the presence of the MS in the new RA,<br>
11, and the MS acknowledges a new P-TMSI by returning a Routeing Area<br>
Update complete message to SGSN 2.<br>
In the case of a rejected routing area update operation, due to<br>
regional subscription or roaming restrictions, or because the SGSN<br>
cannot determine the HLR address to establish the locating updating<br>
dialogue, the new SGSN shall not construct an MM context. A reject<br>
shall be returned to the MS with an appropriate cause. The MS does no<br>
re-attempt a routeing area update to that RA. The RAI value shall be<br>
deleted when the MS is powered up. If the new SGSN is unable to<br>
update the PDP context in one or more GGSNs, the new SGSN shall<br><br>
deactivate the corresponding PDP contexts. This shall not cause th
SGSN to reject the routeing area update. The PDP Contexts shall be<br>
sent from old (second) to new (first) SGSN in a prioritized order,<br>
i.e. the most important PDP Context first in the SGSN Contexl<br>
Response message. (The prioritization method is implementatioi<br>
dependent, but should be based on the current activity). If the nev<br>
SGSN is unable to support the same number of active PDP contexts as<br>
received from old (first) SGSN, the new (second) SGSN should use the<br>
prioritization sent by old SGSN as input when deciding which PDI<br>
contexts to maintain active and which ones to delete. In any case,<br>
the new SGSN shall first update all contexts in one or more GGSNs anc<br>
then deactivate the context (s) that it cannot maintain. This shall<br>
not cause the SGSN to reject the routing area update. If a timer usee<br>
in step 2 expires and no Cancel Location (IMSI) was received from the<br>
HLR, the old (first) SGSN stops forwarding N-PDUs to the new (second)<br>
SGSN. If the routing area update procedure fails a maximum allowable<br>
number of times, or if the SGSN returns a Routing Area Update Reject<br>
(Cause) message, the MS shall enter IDLE state. The CAMEL procedure<br>
calls shall be performed, see referenced procedures in 3GPP T£<br>
23.078:<br>
CI) CAMEL_GPRS_PDP_Context_Disconnection, CAMEL_GPRS_Detach and<br>
CAMEL_PS_Notification.<br>
They are called in the following order:<br>
-	The CAMEL_GPRS_PDP_Context_Disconnection procedure is called<br>
several times: once per PDP context. The procedure returns as<br>
result "Continue".<br>
-	Then the CAMEL_GPRS_Detach procedure is called once. The<br>
procedure returns as result "Continue".<br>
-	Then the CAMEL_PS_Notification procedure is called once. The<br>
procedure return as result "Continue".<br>
C2) CAMEL_GPRS_Routing_Area_Update_Session and CAMEL_PS_<br>
Notification.<br>
21<br><br>
They are called in the following order:<br>
-	The CAMEL_GPRS_Routing_Area_Update_Session procedure is called.<br>
The procedure returns as result "Continue".<br>
-	Then the CAMEL_PS_Notification procedure is called. The<br>
procedure returns as result "Continue".<br>
C3) CAMEL_GPRS_Routing_Area_Update_Context.<br>
This procedure is called several times: once per PDP context. It<br>
returns as result "Continue".<br>
Figs. 8,9,10,11 give examples on how a dedicated information element<br>
or user location information can be defined. As referred to above the<br>
SGSN or for example a PDG provides this information to GGSN. Fig. 8<br>
particularly describes the user location information IE which in this<br>
case is used to indicate CGI/SAI (Cell Global Identifier/Service Area<br>
Identifier) of where the MS currently is located. The "Geographic<br>
Location Type" field is used to convey whether or not location field<br>
is included, and if so, what type of location. The types of locations<br>
that can be conveyed in this particular implementation are defined in<br>
Fig. 9 which shows a table with the geographic location type values<br>
and their meanings.<br>
The "Geographic Location" field is used to convey the actual<br>
geographic information as indicated in the "Geographic Location Type"<br>
field. This field shall not be present if the value of the<br>
"Geographic Location Type" field is 0. In the table of Fig. 9 is<br>
referred to 3GPP TS 23.003, sub-clause 4.3.1 and 3GPP TS 25.413, sub-<br>
clause 9.2.3.9 which herewith are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The location information is generally only of interest for the end<br>
point nodes and intermediate nodes need not be able to comprehend the<br>
location information. The GTP header is a header of variable length<br>
used for GTP-C (Control Plane) and GTP-U (User Plane) protocols. It<br>
among others comprises an always present field, Extension Header<br>
Flag, indicating the presence of a meaningful value of the Next<br><br>
Extension Header Field. According to this embodiment of the present<br>
invention bits 8,7 of the Next Extension Header Type might be set to<br>
1 0, indicating that comprehension of this extension header is<br>
required by the End Point Receiver but not by Intermediate Nodes,<br>
which are supposed to forward the whole field to the End Point.<br>
Alternatively it might be 0 0, indicating that comprehension is not<br>
required. Other alternatives are also possible. This is described in<br>
3GPP TS 29.060 v. 6.5.0. However, it should be clear that also<br>
entirely) different implementations are possible.<br>
Fig. 10 illustrates the geographic location field for CGI. If only<br>
two digits are included in the MNC, then bits 5 to 8 of octet 6 are<br>
coded as "1111". The location area code consists of 2 octets and is<br>
found in octet 8 and octet 9. Bit 8 of octet 8 is the most<br>
significant bit and bit 1 of octet 9 the least significant bit. The<br>
coding of the location area code is their responsibility of each<br>
administration. Coding using full hexadecimal representation shall be<br>
used. The cell identity consists of two octets and is found in octet<br>
10 and octet 11. Bit 8 of octet 10 is the most significant bit and<br>
bit 1 of octet 11 the least significant bit. The coding of the cell<br>
identity is the responsibility of each administration. Preferably<br>
full hexadecimal representation is used.<br>
Fig. 11 finally describes as a table describing the geographic<br>
location field for SAI.<br>
If only two digits are included in the MNC, then bits 5-8 of octet 6<br>
are coded as "1111". The location area code consists of two octets<br>
and it is found in octet 8 and octet 9. Bit 8 of octet 8 is the most<br>
significant bit, and bit 1 of octet 9 is the least significant bit.<br>
The coding of the location area should be the responsibility of a<br>
respective administration. Again coding using full hexadecimal<br>
representation should be used, cf. 3GPP TS 24.008 which herewith is<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The service area code consists of 2 octets and it is found in octets<br>
10 and 11. Bit 8 of octet 10 is the most significant whereas bit 1 of<br>
octet 11 is the least significant bit. SAC is operator defined, cf.<br><br>
3GPP TS 23.003 section 12.5 which herewith is incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
As referred to above the time zone information element may<br>
additionally or alternatively be included, or together with, any other<br>
location related information; any combination is in principle<br>
possible. The time zone information element can with advantage be<br>
used together with the location information to offer better and more<br>
accurate charging and location based services. The MS time zone<br>
information element is used to indicate the offset between universal<br>
time and local time in the steps of 15 minutes of where the MS<br>
currently resides. The time zone field in one embodiment uses the<br>
same form at as the time zone information element discussed above<br>
with reference to Fig. 8, cf. 3GPP TS 24.008, and it is shown in Fig.<br>
12A.<br>
Fig. 12B gives an example on possible values for the daylight saving<br>
time field and meanings thereof. It should be clear that the examples<br>
an location related information elements and time zone elements<br>
merely are given for exemplary reasons, and the invention is by know<br>
means limited to the use of these specific elements.<br>
With the location information and the time zone information in the<br>
GGSN, more accurate charging based on location and time of day gets<br>
possible. It also gives a network operator or an external service<br>
provider provided with this information, the opportunity to develop<br>
location based applications, particularly with a better accuracy<br>
which adds value for the operators as well as for the customers of<br>
the operator.<br>
Fig. 13 shows a particular embodiment allowing for example- operators<br>
to apply different rating depending on the location of a MS/UE while<br>
the appropriate location information is available in the GGSN and, in<br>
addition thereto, in a timely manner. According to the shown solution<br>
location reporting granularity can be different for different MSs/UEs<br>
as well as the triggering of recording can be different.<br><br>
This is for example advantageous if there is a "free of charge"<br>
rating in one cell, whereas a common rating applies in all other<br>
locations. The location tracking then does not need to be so accurate<br>
when the MS/UE is located outside that particular routing area which<br>
contains the "free of charge cell". According to the embodiment<br>
discussed with reference to Figs. 13-15, e.g. Flow Based Rating in<br>
GGSN is extended with differentiated rating '(or other service<br>
provisioning) dspending on location. The characteristics of the<br>
different areas (routing areas, service areas, cells etc.) may result<br>
in different needs for the collection of location information i.e. on<br>
which level (service area level, RA level, cell level etc.) and/or on<br>
frequency or timing for collecting the information.<br>
3GPP TS 23.271 (with particular reference to section 6.3.2.)<br>
specifies a Location Services (LCS). According to the present<br>
invention such an LCS client 9 is introduced in GGSN 45. This provides<br>
for the possibility to collect lgcation related information,<br>
particularly over the Le interface, which is adapted to the actual<br>
needs e.g. for rating purposes, most particularly on a per MS/UE<br>
basis. Thus, the inclusion of the LCS client 9 in GGSN 45 allows for<br>
collection of location related information in a manner appropriate<br>
for rating to be properly differentiated based on location. Both the<br>
accuracy and frequency for the data collection can be adapted to the<br>
needs for rating. It is sufficient if either the CS or PS access<br>
network supports LCS in order to make use of this alternative. The<br>
architecture for Flow Based Charging is defined in 3GPP TS 23.125,<br>
which herewith is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The architecture according to the invention comprises an LCS client 9<br>
in the Traffic Plane Function TPF 8 in GGSN 45 for collection of<br>
location information, particularly for rating purposes. The LCS<br>
client 9 in the TPF 8 subscribes to location information from the<br>
GMLC when the tariff for a user, according to Flow Based Charging,<br>
depends on the location of the mobile user station, e.g. the UE. In<br>
an advantageous embodiment the standardized Le interface Le/LIF-MLP<br>
as specified by 3GPP Rel. 6, 29.198 is used towards the GMLC.<br><br>
In a particular implementation the LCS client issues a Location<br>
Deferred Request with event triggers for a mobile user station<br>
entering/leaving/camping in interesting areas. Examples on such event<br>
triggers are PLMN id, coutry code, time zone or other location<br>
related events. The time zone trigger is particularly an extension to<br>
Le. In other implementations, or additionally, other pre-defined<br>
trigger schemes or trigger events may be developed and implemented in<br>
the GMLC on a per need basis.<br>
In advantageous implementations the LCS client 9 . includes<br>
optimizations, such that location related information is collected<br>
only for subscribers with e.g. a rating depending on the location of<br>
the mobile user station location, and/or the accuracy and a timing of<br>
the location related information is adapted to the need for<br>
performing rating (or providing some kind of services). Examples<br>
hereon are when a mobile user station roams to another operator there<br>
is a single rate that differs from the HPLMN rate, which does not<br>
require exact location information, it is e.g. sufficient with<br>
MLC/MNC. Another example relates to the case when there e.g. is a low<br>
rate when the mobile user station is located in the "home cell", but<br>
otherwise a higher rate. Then accurate location information is<br>
collected in that routing area (RA) where the "home cell" is located.<br>
At other locations, or in other RAs in the HPLMN merely a tracking of<br>
RA changes is necessitated or sufficient. The GMLC collects location<br>
information from SGSN and/or MSC, cf. Fig. 15 below.<br>
Fig. 14 schematically illustrates a block diagram in which an LCS<br>
client 5 is provided in a second CN node, GGSN 4F, or more<br>
specifically in the Traffic Plane Function thereof. The LCS client<br>
then subscribes for location location information from a GMLC 6 over<br>
the Le interface as discussed above. Location information about UE is<br>
provided over RAN 2F to SGSN 3F (or to an 'MSC where the UE is<br>
attached) which provides information to GMLC 6 over the Lg interface.<br>
(Location related information may be transferred from SGSN 3F to GGSN<br>
4F using existing messaging as discussed earlier in the application,<br>
i.e. as dedicated IEs added to traffical packets over' GTP-U or<br>
dedicated IEs added to e.g. Update PDP Context Requests. The initial<br>
location information, provided in the create PDP Context Request may<br><br>
help the LCS client to issue a tailored subscription for location<br>
reports from the GMLC.) However, the concept with an LCS client in<br>
the GGSN for collecting location information in communication with a<br>
GMLC is also applicable when location information is provided in<br>
other or conventional manners to GGSN.<br>
It is an advantage of the implementation as described with reference<br>
to Figs. 13,14,15, that location information for mobile user stations<br>
with a session established can be collected in the GGSN e.g. for<br>
rating purposes. Particularly the collection of location information<br>
can be restricted to mobile user stations where the rating depends on<br>
location. Further, the collection of location information may be<br>
optimized per mobile user station with an appropriate accuracy to<br>
perform rating or other location dependent services. Most<br>
advantageously the collection of location information may utilize the<br>
circuit switched (CS) part over an MSC of the network to collect<br>
location information to the GMLC as can also be seen in Fig. 15. This<br>
is relevant in case the SGSN does not support LCS. Basically this<br>
means that the implementation of this embodiment does not depend on<br>
an SGSN supporting LCS, if it does not, the MSC can be used instead<br>
for the same purposes, which is extremely advantageous.<br>
In one embodiment location information is expressed in terms that do<br>
not depend on RAN e.g. GPS (Global Positioning System) information<br>
collected by the GMLC. Still further the GMLC may include specialized<br>
logic to provide information tailored for the TPF needs, e.g. to<br>
provide time zone information for a mobile user station.<br>
Thus, the embodiment described with reference to Figs. 13-15 combines<br>
the concept of Flow Based Charging and a possibility to implement<br>
rating that depends on user location without causing unnecessary<br>
signalling for mobile user stations where the location information<br>
actually is irrelevant or not needed for the rating or whatever<br>
purpose that is to be provided or offered.<br>
The collection of location information is advantageously made<br>
adaptive such that unnecessarily frequent or accurate information<br><br>
collection is avoided, which results in benefits as far as 'signalling<br>
and performance is concerned.<br>
This is particularly of importance when not already existing<br>
messaging is used for providing location related information, but it<br>
still provides a high variety and flexibility also for other purposes<br>
than reducing unnecessary signalling.<br>
In Fig. 15 can be seen how mobile user stations UE are connected to a<br>
GERAN 2G and an UTRAN 2H respectively. The GERAN 2G is connected over<br>
the A-interface to a 2G-MSC 3GX and over the Gb-interface to a 2G-SGSN<br>
3G2. Further it is connected to a 3G-SGSN 3G3 and an MSC-server 3G4<br>
over the Iu-interface. UTRAN 2H is connected to the 3G-SGSN 3G3 and<br>
the MSC-server 3G4 over the Iu-interface. All core network nodes, i.e.<br>
MSC, SGSN and MSC-server are connected over the Lg-interface with the<br>
GMLC 61, which communicates with the LCS client in GGSN 4G over the<br>
Le-interfaces as discussed above.<br>
It should be clear that this merely illustrates one particular,<br>
advantageous, implementation of a second aspect of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Fig. 16 is a flow diagram showing one embodiment of the present<br>
invention in which dedicated information elements are added to all<br>
the user packets, from a mobile user station for which location<br>
related information is to be provided to e.g. a GGSN. Hence, it is<br>
first established in a 1st (core) network node, e.g. an SGSN* (or a PDG<br>
in case of a WLAN access network being used) for which MS/UE(s)<br>
location related information is to be collected, 100. Location<br>
related information may have been requested from a GGSN, external<br>
networks; specific mobile user stations may pointed out, or mobile<br>
user stations meeting given criteria may be indirectly indicated, or<br>
it may concern all mobile user stations handled by e.g. the SGSN. The<br>
1st (core) network node, in the following denoted SGSN for reasons of<br>
simplicity, then establishes which type/level of location related<br>
information that is to be collected, or that is of interest, in the<br>
latter case the SGSN only storing or sorting the relevant<br><br>
information, e.g. location information on cell-level or service area<br>
etc., 101.<br>
Once this is done, SGSN requests such information, or generally<br>
location related information, from the radio access network,<br>
particularly control nodes such as RAN, RNC, UNC etc. as discussed<br>
earlier in the application, 102. The requested location related<br>
information is then collected in SGSN, 103. The collected location<br>
related information is, in SGSN, arranged in new, also called<br>
dedicated, information element(s) IE, 104.<br>
The collected information, the IEs, are stored in storing means in<br>
SGSN, e.g. in a DB, particularly an existing subscriber database,<br>
e.g. the MM DB, even if also other alternatives are possible. The<br>
location related information is of course sorted and associated with<br>
the appropriate mobile user stations, 105.<br>
Subsequently, when a user packet arrives in SGSN from an established<br>
mobile user station, this is detected, 106, the corresponding IE<br>
fetched from the DB, and the user packet is encapsulated in SGSN in a<br>
GTP-U packet and the fetched IE is added to the GTP-U header of the<br>
user packet, 107. The encapsulated user packet with the dedicated IE<br>
is then tunneled by GTP-U to the GGSN, 108. This is done for all user<br>
packets from all established mobile user stations.<br>
It should be clear that one or more dedicated IEs can be added<br>
depending on how the information is arranged and in which location<br>
related information that is requested. It may e.g. be one IE for user<br>
location and one for time zone information etc.<br>
The principle remains the same if the IE(s) are added to Update PDP<br>
Context Requests from e.g. SGSN to GGSN, but then the information is<br>
provided in the signalling plane.<br>
As referred to earlier in the application an LCS client or<br>
correspondingly may be arranged in GGSN, and GGSN may use/forward the<br>
received location related information in many different manners, e.g.<br>
to external service providers.<br><br>
Fig. 17 is a sequence diagram describing the procedure when flow<br>
based charging in GGSN is extended or provided with differentiated<br>
rating depending on location, when an LCS client is provided in GGSN<br>
(cf. Figs. 13-15) for collecting location information for rating<br>
purposes.<br>
1,2 relates to activation and creation of a PDP Context Request, in a<br>
conventional manner. A request for charging rules 3, is then sent<br>
from GGSN to CRF (Charging Rules Function), which provides the<br>
charging rules to GGSN, 4. Then, according to the invention, a<br>
triggered Location Reporting Request is sent from GGSN to GMLC, 5,<br>
which responds with a message Provide Subscriber Location, 6. This is<br>
acknowledged by SGSN to GMLC, 7. Then a Triggered Location Reporting<br>
Answer message is sent from GMLC to GGSN, 8. A Credit Request may<br>
then be sent from GGSN to CCS (On-line Charging System) , 9, which<br>
responds with a Credit Response, 10. A Create PDP Context Response,<br>
11, is then provided from GGSN to SGSN, 11, which sends ah Activate<br>
PDP Context Accept to the MS, 12. 13 indicates a Triggered Location<br>
Report from GMLC to GGSN, which is novel like messages 5-8.<br>
Later it is supposed that a Deactivate PDP Context Request is sent<br>
from MS to SGSN, 14, which thereupon sends a Delete PDP Context<br>
Request to GGSN, 15. GGSN then sends an Indication of Bearer<br>
Termination to CRF, 16, which sends a message Provision of Charging<br>
Rules to GGSN. After the sending of a message Final Remaining Credit<br>
Report to CCS, 18, and the response to that, 19, to GGSN, 19, a<br>
Triggered Location Reporting Stop Request, 20, is sent from GGSN to<br>
GMLC. GMLC returns an answer to GGSN, 21. These messages 20, 21 are<br>
also novel and terminate the subscription to location reporting.<br>
Finally follows a Delete PDP Context Response, 22, and a Deactivate<br>
PDP Context Accept, 23, in a conventional manner. It should be clear<br>
that this merely illustrates one specific implementation.<br>
The location related information may be used and taken advantage of<br>
in many different manners, e.g. for rating or charging purposes, but<br>
also for many other purposes, e.g. for providing services to relevant<br><br>
mobile user stations in a relevant area or location, e.g. for warning<br>
for traffic hazards in particular locations or to offer relevant<br>
services.<br>
It should be clear that the invention by no means is limited to the<br>
specifically illustrated embodiments, but that it can be varied in a<br>
number of ways within the scope of the appended claims.<br><br>
