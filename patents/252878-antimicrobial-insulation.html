BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] The present invention relates generally to insulation and methods for<br>
making insulation. In particular, the present invention relates to an efficient and<br>
economical method for producing insulation that possesses antimicrobial (e.g.,<br>
antibacterial and antifungal) properties.<br>
[0003] Insulation is a ubiquitous construction material. It is found in<br>
practically all residential and commercial construction and its importance in the<br>
construction of new structures cannot be over emphasized. The primary function of<br>
insulation is to act as a heat transfer barrier between the interior of a structure and the<br>
outside environment. Thus insulation, if properly installed, can greatly reduce heating<br>
and air conditioning costs. Insulation can also serve as a sound barrier, moisture<br>
barrier, and vapor/air barrier.<br>
[0004] The diverse functions of insulation led to the development of many<br>
different types of insulation. Some insulation is blown loosely into attics. Other<br>
insulation consists of foam sheets nailed to walls. The present invention pertains to<br>
arguably the most common form of insulation -fiberglass batting that has one side<br>
faced with Kraft paper. This type of insulation generally comes in large rolls which<br>
are then unrolled to form a mat in attics and walls.<br><br>
[0005] For the remainder of this document the term insulation will refer to<br>
paper faced fiberglass batting.	<br>
[0006] One of the problems traditionally associated with the use of insulation<br>
is the susceptibility of kraft paper to moisture absorption in damp environments.<br>
Unfortunately, insulation used in interior construction sometimes can encounter water<br>
due to leaks in roofs, windows, or plumbing. Furthermore, many geographical areas<br>
are characterized by high humidity which also provides a source of water that can be<br>
absorbed by kraft paper faced insulation Although the fiberglass component of the<br>
insulation is not hospitable to the growth of microbes, the kraft paper facing of the<br>
insulation is susceptible to supporting microbial growth, specifically fungal and<br>
bacterial growth.<br>
[0007] The growth of fungus and bacteria on insulation is undesirable for<br>
many reasons. First, it traps moisture in the insulation which can lead to<br>
promulgation of even more fungus and bacteria and weakening of adjacent structural<br>
members. Unpleasant odors and staining are also associated with microbial growth.<br>
More seriously, many people are susceptible to life threatening allergic responses<br>
when exposed to fungal spores. The issues created by. microbial growth on insulation,<br>
especially the human health issues, drives a continuing need for insulation that is<br>
resistant to microbial growth.<br>
[0008] To date, the patent literature has failed to address the issue of<br>
biological contamination of insulation. However, the patent literature contains several<br>
examples of attempts to address the problem of microbial growth on a somewhat<br>
related material: wallboard. Wallboard is a construction material used to form <br>
walls. Wallboard is somewhat similar to insulation in that it comprises a structural<br>
material (a sheet of gypsum instead of fiberglass) attached to one or two sheets of<br>
kraft paper. The kraft paper used in insulation, however, is usually thinner than that<br>
used with wallboard.<br>
[0009] Commonly assigned US Patent Application Serial No. 10/250,143,<br>
from with this, application claims priority, discusses the need to provide built-in and<br>
long-lasting antimicrobial protection to the kraft paper used in the production of<br>
wallboard.<br><br><br>
[0010] The current invention is an extension and improvement of the work<br>
begun in the 143 application and continued in subsequent applications from which<br>
the present application also claims priority.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0011] The present invention derives from research directed at developing a<br>
commercially viable process for making, insulation that exhibits antimicrobial<br>
 characteristics. One result of this research was the development of insulation which<br>
exhibits antimicrobial characteristics and resists the growth of microbes. In broad<br>
terms, the insulation according to the invention comprises an insulating material such<br>
as fiberglass, a non-woven covering adjacent the insulating material, and an<br>
antimicrobial composition. In many embodiments the insulating material will be<br>
attached to the non-woven covering by an adhesive. The antimicrobial composition is<br>
preferably intimately associated with the non-woven covering, the adhesive or both.<br>
[0012] The invention also encompasses a method for producing insulation that<br>
exhibits antimicrobial characteristics and resists the growth of microbes. The method<br>
comprises the steps of contacting a non-woven covering to an insulating material, and<br>
applying an antimicrobial composition to the non-woven covering. The method also<br>
comprises adding an antimicrobial composition to the insulation or to a component<br>
thereof at levels sufficient to exhibit efficacy against microbes.<br>
 DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0013] Turning now to the specifics of the invention, in one broad aspect, the<br>
invention is insulation that exhibits antimicrobial characteristics and resists the growth<br>
of microbes. As used herein, the term microbes encompasses bacteria, fungi, and<br>
other such forms of life that are generally considered by those skilled in the art to fall<br>
within the realm of microbiology. Fungus (i.e., mold and mildew), however, is a<br>
primary concern with insulation. Accordingly, and for ease of discussion, this<br>
detailed description will often make reference to fungus and antifungal agents. This<br>
method of presentation should not be interpreted as limiting the scope of the invention<br>
in any way.<br><br><br>
[0014] The term efficacy, as used herein, is defined as the characteristic of<br>
inhibiting the growth of a microbe on a substrate.<br>
[0015] The term non-metallic antimicrobial agent as used herein means<br>
antimicrobial agents, other than quaternary ammonium compounds, that do not<br>
contain or utilize metal ions (e.g., Ag, Cu).<br>
[0016] The term antimicrobial composition, as used herein, includes<br>
individual antimicrobial agents (e.g., silver, triclosan, zinc oxide, etc.) and various<br>
combinations of antimicrobial agents and other additives.<br>
[0017] In its broadest aspects, the insulation according to the invention<br>
comprises an insulating material, a non woven covering adjacent the insulating<br>
material and an antimicrobiail composition. In most instances the non-woven covering<br>
will be connected to the insulating material using an adhesive. In many instances the<br>
adhesive is an asphalt or tar-like adhesive that is well known in the industry.<br>
[0018] The insulating material may be any of the commonly known insulating<br>
materials. Perhaps the most commonly, known and used insulating material is<br>
fiberglass batting. This type of. insulating material is found in most commercially<br>
available lines of insulation including the well known pink colored insulation<br>
available from Owens-Corning. Fiberglass batting is the preferred insulating material<br>
for use in the practice of the invention.<br>
[0019] The non-woven covering used in the practice of the invention may be<br>
any type of non-woven material capable of attachment to and support of insulating<br>
material. Synthetic polymer non-woven mats are examples of acceptable non-woven<br>
material.<br>
[0020] More preferably, the non-woven covering used in the practice of the<br>
invention is made from natural polymers such as cellulose. Kraft paper is the non-<br>
woven material of choice used in the insulation industry. Accordingly, a particularly<br>
preferred non-woven covering for use with the invention is kraft paper.<br>
[0021] The antimicrobial composition and the various methods of applying the<br>
antimicrobial composition to the non-woven covering represent the most diverse<br><br><br>
aspect of the invention. If synthetic polymer non-woven material is used then the<br>
antimicrobial composition can be added to the polymer melt prior to formation of the<br>
non-woven mat. Furthermore, the antimicrobial compositions that may be used in the<br>
conjunction with synthetic polymer non-woven coverings include all of the<br>
antimicrobial agents, or combinations of agents, commonly used with synthetic<br>
polymers. Such agents include, but are not limited to chlorinated phenols (e.g.,<br>
triclosan), quaternary ammonium compounds, azoles, and metals (e.g., silver zeolites,<br>
silver ions). Those skilled in the art are well versed at adding such agents to polymers<br>
and can choose the appropriate agent and loading levels for the polymer of interest<br>
without undue experimentation.<br>
[0022] Similarly, if kraft paper is the non-woven covering, the antimicrobial<br>
agents utilized in the practice of the invention may include any antimicrobial<br>
composition capable of imparting antimicrobial characteristics to insulation and<br>
particularly the non-woven (e.g., kraft paper) covering. Many of these antimicrobial<br>
agents are discussed or cited in priority document U.S. Patent Application Serial<br>
Number 10/250,143, which is incorporated herein by reference. Such agents include,<br>
but are not limited to chlorinated phenols (e.g., triclosan), quaternary ammonium<br>
compounds, azoles, and metals (e.g., silver zeolites, silver ions).<br>
[0023] Likewise, the antimicrobial composition may be applied to the kraft<br>
paper in any of several ways. For example, the paper may be treated by adding<br>
antimicrobial compositions to the fiber/pulp slurry during formation of the paper.<br>
Although this method can be effective, it tends to be cost prohibitive. Alternatively,<br>
the paper may be surface treated with an antimicrobial composition.<br>
[0024] Spraying the paper covering with the antimicrobial composition, either<br>
before or after contact with the insulation material, is within the scope of the<br>
invention. Those skilled in the art of papermaking are very familiar with spraybars<br>
and their use and how they can be easily adopted for use with the present invention.<br>
[0025] Another method of treating the paper surface is to apply the<br>
antimicrobial composition as a uniform coating on one side or both sides of the paper<br>
covering as the paper covering is made. For example, the antimicrobial composition<br><br><br>
could be applied to the paper at the calendar stack rolls using a water bath that is<br>
sometimes present in papermaking processes<br>
[0026] In some instances the papermaking process may determine both the<br>
method of application and the antimicrobial composition used. Each papermaking<br>
process is unique in some respect and those skilled in the art can easily determine<br>
which application method and antimicrobial composition is best for their particular<br>
process.<br>
[0027] Regardless of the manner of applying the antimicrobial composition,<br>
all embodiments of the invention contain a quantity of antimicrobial composition<br>
sufficient to exhibit efficacy against microbes and particularly various species of<br>
fungi. More specifically, the preferred embodiments of the invention contain a<br>
quantity of antimicrobial composition sufficient to inhibit microbial growth on a<br>
substrate tested in accordance with AATCC (American Association of Chemists &amp;<br>
Colorists) Test Method 30, Part III. Those skilled in the art are familiar with this test<br>
method and its parameters.<br>
[0028] As an aid to the reader, and to those skilled in the art, there are several<br>
preferred combinations of application methods and antimicrobial compositions for use<br>
with embodiments of the invention that employ kraft paper. (Please note that these<br>
antimicrobial compositions could also be used with synthetic polymers.) The<br>
following paragraphs will present three particularly preferred antimicrobial agents and<br>
ways of applying each. It should also be noted that the methods of application<br>
discussed herein can be used with any of the antimicrobial compositions. The<br>
following compositions and methods of application are exemplary and should not be<br>
interpreted to limit the scope of the invention.<br>
Antimicrobial Composition #1<br>
[0029] In one embodiment the antimicrobial composition is an antimicrobial<br>
system that comprises a first antimicrobial agent in a first carrier and a second<br>
antimicrobial agent in a second carrier. Preferably, the first and second carriers are at<br>
least partly soluble in each other. This adds to the stability of the antimicrobial<br>
system by minimizing the formation of two liquid phases.<br><br><br>
[0030] For example and as discussed in more detail below, one antimicrobial<br>
agent suitable for use in the practice of the invention is propiconazole which is<br>
commercially available from Janssen Pharmacetica under the trade name WOCOSEN.<br>
Another antimicrobial agent suitable for use in the present invention is diiodomethyl-<br>
4-tolylsulfone which is commercially available from Dow Chemical under the trade<br>
name AMICAL. Both commercial embodiments can be obtained in carriers that are<br>
soluble in each other which improve the system's stability.<br>
[0031] Commercially available antimicrobial agents suitable for use in the<br>
antimicrobial system can come in surfactant based carriers. Although surfactant<br>
based carriers can be used in the practice of the invention care should be taken when<br>
using such carriers to ensure that the application system does not become burdened<br>
with foam. Foam can sometimes develop if the application system provides for the<br>
agitation of the antimicrobial composition. Foam can detrimentally effect the smooth<br>
and uniform distribution of the active ingredients. In some instances a small quantity<br>
of an anti-foaming agent can be added to the antimicrobial composition to reduce the<br>
foam Preferred anti-foaming agents are ethoxylated co-polymers of polyethylene<br>
glycoL<br>
[0032] Testing has shown that acceptable efficacy of treated paper can be<br>
obtained by roll coating the paper using an antimicrobial system in which the<br>
combined concentration of two antimicrobial agents was less than 1000 ppm and in<br>
many instances less than 500 ppm<br>
[0033] Accordingly, in preferred embodiments the first antimicrobial agent<br>
used in the antimicrobial system is selected from the group consisting of<br>
propiconazole, sodium pyrithione, and mixtures thereof Both agents are<br>
commercially available in various concentrations and can be diluted to the extent<br>
necessary by those skilled in the art.<br>
[0034] Preferably, the second antimicrobial agent used in the antimicrobial<br>
system is selected from the group consisting oftolyl diiodomethyl sulfone;<br>
tebuconazole, thiabendazole;; and 3-iodo-2-propynyl butylcarbamate, and mixtures<br>
thereof These agents are commercially available as well.<br><br><br>
[0035] Those skilled in the art can readily adjust the relative quantities of each<br>
of the antimicrobial agents in the antimicrobial system to achieve the desired levelsof<br>
efficacy. In general, higher concentrations translate to higher efficacy. However, a<br>
preferred embodiment of the antimicrobial system is an emulsion comprising by<br>
weight about 0.1% to 0.8% propiconazole, 0.1% to 0.5% tolyl diiodomethyl sulfone,<br>
and 0.05% -0.15% 3-iodo-2-propynyl butylcarbamate, in water.<br>
[0036] Emulsions using 0.20% propiconazole, 0.175% tolyl diiodomethyl<br>
sulfone, and 0.10% 3-iodo-2-propynyl butylcarbamate, in water, applied to 50 lb. per<br>
square foot paper showed acceptable efficacy when applied to the surface of the paper<br>
at between about 5% and about 20% wet pickup based on the dry weight of the paper.<br>
Wet pickup between about 5% and about 7% showed acceptable results and would be<br>
preferable due to cost considerations. The quantity picked up by the paper can be<br>
adjusted in several ways known to those skilled in the art.<br>
Examples<br>
[0037] Various combinations of the following antimicrobial agents were<br>
thoroughly mixed together at ambient conditions in water as shown in Table 1 below.<br><br><br><br>
[0038] The formulations in Table 1 were applied to 50 lb. kraft paper stock<br>
using a wire-wound rod to control lay down. Approximate pickup was about 15%.<br>
The paper samples were tested via AATCC Method 30, Part II to evaluate the<br>
compositions for antifungal efficacy. The test organism was A. Niger. After<br>
incubation for seven (7) days, the samples were evaluated based upon the following<br>
scale; 0 represents no observed growth; 1 represents growth apparent only under a<br>
microscope; and 2 represents growth visible to the naked eye. In addition, there may<br>
be zones of inhibition where growth of the organisms is inhibited from growing<br>
anywhere in the vicinity of the samples. Thus, results are reported as a rating, with<br>
zones of inhibition where applicable. The results of this testing are shown in Table 2.<br>
The romannumerals identify the various combinations of ingredients.<br><br><br><br>
(I)	- Formulation of Table 1 containing water and no binder.<br>
(II)	- Formulation of Table 1 including 1% by weight silicone coating (RE 29).<br>
(III)	- Formulation of Table 1 including 1% by weight of cationic polymer having<br>
affinity for paper.<br>
(IV)	- Formulation of Table I including 1% by weight of a silane coupling agent.<br>
[0039] As the results show, A, B, C, and D formulations showed no observed<br>
growth. The untreated controls showed no efficacy.<br>
[0040] Additional lab tests were run to determine if efficacy could be achieved<br>
using lesser concentrations of antimicrobial agents. Several combinations of active<br>
agents were tested at various concentrations to observe efficacy. The combinations<br>
shown below were applied to 2 inch by 2 inch squares of 50 lb. kraft paper and tested<br>
using AATCC Method 30, Part 111. The results are shown in Tables 3 and 4.<br><br><br><br>
[0041] As the above data indicates, acceptable inhibition of microbial growth<br>
can be achieved using relatively low concentrations of antimicrobial agents. As low<br>
as 400 ppm combined active agent can achieve zero growth and a zone of inhibition.<br>
[0042] Preferably, the antimicrobial system is applied to the non-woven<br>
covering (i.e., paper) such that the first antimicrobial agent is present in or on the non-<br>
woven covering in a concentration between about 50 ppm and about 1200 ppm, more<br>
preferably between about 200 ppm and 1200 ppm In particularly preferred<br><br>
embodiments, the first antimicrobial agent is propiconazole and is present in a<br>
concentration between about 80 ppm and 1000 ppm; more preferably between about<br>
500 ppm and 1000 ppm<br>
[0043] Likewise, the; second antimicrobial agent preferably is present in the<br>
non-woven covering at a concentration between about 40 ppm and 1600 ppm; more<br>
preferably between about 60 ppm and 1400 ppm In particularly preferred .<br>
embodiments, the second antimicrobial agent isolyl diiodomethyl sulfone (Amical<br>
Flowable from Dow) and is present in a concentration between about 40 ppm and<br>
1600 ppm; more preferably between about 60 ppm and 1400 ppm.<br>
Antimicrobial Composition #2<br>
[0044] In another embodiment, the antimicrobial composition used in the<br>
practice of the invention comprises a microemulsion of a quaternary ammonium<br>
antimicrobial agent, a phenol, and water.<br>
[0045] In its most basic form, this embodiment of the antimicrobial<br>
composition comprises an aqueous microemulsion. The microemulsion comprises a<br>
quaternary ammonium antimicrobial agent, a phenol, and water. Interestingly, the<br>
composition need not contain the volatile alcohols (e.g., ethanol) that are usually used<br>
to form emulsions of quaternary ammonium antimicrobial agents. Each of these<br>
elements, and other preferred and optional elements, will be discussed in more detail<br>
below.<br>

[0047] In particularly preferred embodiments the quaternary ammonium<br>
antimicrobial agent comprises a dimethylbenzyl ammonium compound such as N-<br>
alkyl dimethylbenzyl ammonium saccharinate. N-alkyl dimethylbenzyl ammonium<br>
saccharinate is commercially available from Stepan Chemical Company of Northfield,<br>
Illinois, under the trade name ONYXCIDE™ 3300. This particular form of<br>
ONYXIDE™ is approximately 95% active and is a solid at room temperature but will<br>
form a liquid at elevated temperature. It is light yellow-orange in color and is<br>
insoluble in water.<br>
[0048] The phenol utilized in the practice of the invention is preferably an<br>
alkyl phenol, a styrenated phenol, or a combination of the two. Such phenols are<br>
commercially available from a number of sources.<br>
[0049] The precise phenol utilized in the practice of the invention will likely<br>
be determined by the overall process. If it is determined that an alkyl phenol is best<br>
for a particular process, the alkyl phenol utilized in this embodiment preferably<br>
comprises at least one alkyl phenol having at least one an alkyl group selected from<br>
the group consisting of C7 alkyls, CS alkyls, C9 alkyls, C10 alkyls, and C11 alkyls.<br>
[0050] In most preferred embodiments the alkyl phenol comprises an alkyl<br>
phenol having a C9 alkyl group.<br>
[0051] Alkyl phenols suitable for use in this embodiment are commercially<br>
available from a number of sources. Particularly preferred commercially available<br>
alkyl phenols include TRITON™ X-207 sold by Dow Chemical Company.<br><br><br>
[0052] In a similar fashion, the particular styrenated phenol utilized in the<br>
practice of the invention will depend upon the overall process. In preferred<br>
embodiments, the styrenated phenol is preferably non-ionic. Preferred styrenated<br>
phenols include CHROMASIST™ WEZ and STAND APOL HS™, both of which are<br>
commercially available from Cognis Corporation whose North American office is in<br>
Cincinnati, Ohio.<br>
[0053] Water makes up the other primary component of this embodiment of<br>
the antimicrobial composition.<br>
[0054] The antimicrobial composition may contain other additives. Two such<br>
additives are anti-foaming agents and anti-freezing agents.<br>
[0055] The alkyl phenols and styrenated phenols used in this embodiment of <br>
the antimicrobial, composition can be susceptible to foaming depending upon the <br>
particular application. Therefore, it is envisioned that some commercial applications<br>
will contain anti-foaming agents.<br>
[0056] For example, this embodiment of the antimicrobial composition<br>
according to the invention may be used to treat kraft paper. One method of treating<br>
this type of paper is to add the antimicrobial composition to the water box, a device<br>
toward the end of the paper process that returns a certain quantity of water to the '<br>
paper after the paper has undergone heat based drying.<br>
[0057] The water box is often agitated due to the continuous movement of<br>
paper through it. This agitation can cause foaming upon the addition of the claimed<br>
antimicrobial composition. Generally, the presence of foam is detrimental to the water<br>
box portion of a paper process. Therefore an anti-foarning agent is added to the<br>
composition according to the invention when the invention is used to treat paper at the<br>
water box.<br>
[0058] Preferred anti-foaming agents are ethoxylated co-polymers of<br>
polyethylene glycol. In some instances, the commerical formulations of stryrenated<br>
phenols and alkyl phenols may contain a quantity of an antifoaming agent.. For<br>
example, TRITON™ X-207 contains a small quantity of polyethylene glycol.<br><br><br>
Accordingly, if TRITON™ X-207 is the source of the phenol additional antifoaming<br>
agent may not be needed.<br>
[0059] Likewise, anti-freezing agents may be added to the composition<br>
according to the invention. The anti-freezing agents are not thought to be critical to<br>
the actual performance of the invention. Instead they are used to keep the<br>
composition from freezing ox becoming too viscous during transport in cold weather.<br>
The anti-freezing agents may be left out of the composition if they are found to<br>
interfere with the addition of the antimicrobial agent in any particular process. A<br>
preferred anti-freezing agent is dipropylene glycol.<br>
[0060] The relative quantities of each of the discussed components may vary<br>
to accommodate particular process requirements. Again, those skilled in the art are<br>
fully capable of making these adjustments without undue experimentation.<br>
[0061] In preferred embodiments the quaternary ammonium antimicrobial<br>
agent is present in the antimicrobial composition in an amount between about 1 wt. %<br>
and 30 wt. %. In particularly preferred embodiments the quaternary ammonium<br>
antimicrobial agent is present between about 15 wt % and 20 wt. % of the overall<br>
composition.<br>
[0062] As an example of how the invention may be tailored to meet specific<br>
process requirements, it was determined that a composition having approximately 17<br>
wt. % ONYXIDE™ 3300 successfully and efficiently imparted antimicrobial<br>
characteristics to kraft paper in one particular papermaking process.<br>
[0063] Likewise, the total phenol content of the antimicrobial composition<br>
(e.g., alkyl, styrenated, or combination of the two) is between about 10 wt. % and<br>
about 60 wt. % of the total composition. Preferred embodiments utilize between<br>
about 20 wt. % to about 50 wt. % alkyl phenol and about 1. wt. % to about 10 wt. %<br>
styrenated phenol.<br>
[0064] In one exemplary paper making process, it was determined that a<br>
combination of alkyl and styrenated phenol worked best for that particular process.<br>
Specifically, the preferred total phenol content in that embodiment was between about<br>
25 wt. % and about 50 wt. %. Optimization of that particular process resulted in the<br><br><br>
alkyl phenol being close to about 44 wt. % while the styrenated phenol was close to<br>
about 5 wt. %.<br>
[0065] It is anticipated that in most applications the quantity of anti-foaming<br>
agent needed for successful practice of the invention will range between about 0 wt.<br>
% to about 20 wt. %:<br>
[0066] The remainder of the antimicrobial composition comprises water. In<br>
preferred embodiments the quantity of water present in the claimed composition will<br>
be between about 5 wt.% and about 30 wt. %, more preferably between about 10 wt.<br>
% and about 20 wt. %. Again, the exact quantity of water will depend upon the<br>
particular application and those skilled in the art a capable of making the necessary<br>
adjustments.<br>
[0067] The invention also encompasses a method of making the antimicrobial<br>
composition.<br>
[0068] In broad terms, the method comprises the steps of blending a phenol<br>
with a quaternary ammonium antimicrobial agent, heating the blended phenol and<br>
quaternary ammonium antimicrobial agent if necessary (some combinations of<br>
phenol/quaternary agent may not require heat), and admixing a quantity of water.<br>
[0069] In preferred embodiments, the phenol (e.g., TRITON™ X-207) is<br>
blended with the quaternary ammonium antimicrobial agent (e.g., ONYXIDE™) in<br>
the presence of heat. The heat is applied because in many instances the quaternary<br>
ammonium antimicrobial agent is a solid at room temperature. Care should be taken<br>
not to heat the admixture of phenol and antimicrobial agent to a point where there is<br>
unacceptable volatilization of either.<br>
[0070] If ONYXIDE™ is the antimicrobial agent, a mixing temperature of<br>
between about 65° C and about 75° C is recommended. At this temperature the<br>
ONYXIDE™ melts into the phenol to form a liquid.<br>
[0071] Anti-foaming agents and anti-freezing agents such as those discussed-<br>
previously can be added at this point if needed or desired.<br><br><br>
[0072] Once the antimicrobial agent and the phenol are mixed the heat may be<br>
removed. As the admixture cools to room temperature water is added with stirring.<br>
[0073] The relative amounts of antimicrobial agent, phenol, and water utilized<br>
in the method are the same as those discussed in relation to the composition.<br>
Likewise, the relative amounts of anti-foaming agents, anti-freezing agents, and<br>
additional antimicrobial agents, if used, are the same as those discussed in relation to<br>
the composition.<br>
Antimicrobial Composition #3<br>
[0074] The term non-metallic as used herein means antimicrobial agents, other<br>
than quaternary ammonium compounds, that do not contain or utilize metal ions (e.g.,<br>
Ag,Cu).	<br>
[0075] In another embodiment, the antimicrobial composition comprises a<br>
microemulsion of a quaternary ammonium antimicrobial agent and two different types<br>
of non-metallic antimicrobial agents. The microemulsion can come in two forms.<br>
One is an aqueous microemulsion well suited for aqueous systems. The other is a<br>
non-aqueous microemulsion well suited for non-aqueous or organic solvent type<br>
systems. In the context of insulation it is expected that the aqueous microemulsion<br>
will be the more frequently used form<br>
[0076] Turning now to more specific embodiments of this antimicrobial<br>
composition, one embodiment is an aqueous antimicrobial composition that can<br>
impart antimicrobial characteristics to kraft paper and many different products. In its<br>
most basic form, this embodiment of the invention comprises an aqueous<br>
microemulsion. The microemulsion comprises a quaternary ammonium antimicrobial<br>
agent, a phenol, a first non-metallic antimicrobial agent, a second non-metallic<br>
antimicrobial agent, and water. Interestingly, the composition need not contain the<br>
volatile alcohols (e.g., ethanol) that are usually used to form emulsions of quaternary<br>
ammonium antimicrobial agents. Each of these elements, and other preferred and<br>
optional elements, will be discussed in more detail below.<br><br><br>
[0077] Quaternary ammonium antimicrobial agents utilized in this<br>
composition include those listed in the previous embodiments of the antimicrobial<br>
composition.<br>
[0078] In particularly preferred embodiments the quaternary ammonium<br>
antimicrobial agent comprises a dimethylbenzyl ammonium compound such as N-<br>
alkyl dimethylbenzyl ammomum saccharinate. N-alkyl dimethylbenzyl ammonium<br>
saccharinate is commercially available from Stepan Chemical Company of Northfield,<br>
Illinois, under the tradename ONYXCIDE™ 3300. This particular form of<br>
ONYXIDE™ is approximately 95% active and is a solid at room temperature but will<br>
form a liquid at elevated temperature. It is light yellow-orange in color and is<br>
insoluble in water.<br>
[0079] The phenol utilized in the practice of the invention may comprise an<br>
alkyl phenol having at least one an alkyl group selected from the group consisting of<br>
C7 alkyls, C8 alkyls, C9 alkyls, C10 alkyls, and C11 alkyls.<br>
[0080] In most preferred embodiments the alkyl phenol comprises an alkyl<br>
phenol having a C9 alkyl group.<br>
[0081] Alkyl phenols suitable for use in the practice of the claimed invention<br>
are available commercially from a number of sources. A particularly preferred<br>
commercially available alkyl phenol is sold by Dow Chemical Company under the<br>
tradename TRITON™ X-207.<br>
[0082] Alternatively., the phenol utilized in the practice of the invention can'<br>
comprise a styrenated phenol. Two examples of styrenated phenols acceptable for use<br>
with the invention are CHROMASIST WEZ and STANDAPOL HS. Both are<br>
available from Cognis Corporation of Cincinnati, Ohio. Both are identified by CAS #<br>
3217120. Technical data sheets indicate that the primary difference between the two<br>
is the level of ethoxylation.<br>
[0083] The different phenols that may be employed in the practice of this<br>
embodiment of the invention are an example of both the flexibility of the invention<br>
and the choices that one skilled in the art may have to make in the practice of the<br>
invention. Those skilled in the art will recognize that one phenol may work better in<br><br><br>
one particular paper or insulation making process The fine tuning of the invention to<br>
suit a particular process is anticipated and should not limit the scope of the invention<br>
in any way. Those skilled in the art will be able to make the small necessary<br>
adjustments to adapt the invention to their particular process without undue<br>
experimentation.<br>
[0084] The non-metallic antimicrobial agents used in this embodiment of the<br>
invention are preferably selected from the azole family of antimicrobial agents..<br>
Generally speaking, azoles comprise a large class of compounds characterized by a<br>
five membered ring which contains an atom of nitrogen and at least one other<br>
noncarbon atom (e.g., nitrogen, oxygen, and sulphur). Certain azoles exhibit<br>
antimicrobial (i.e., antifungal) properties. Triazoles are a subclass of azoles that are<br>
often used as antimicrobial agents.<br>
[0085] Two of the more well known antimicrobial triazoles are propiconazole<br>
and tebuconazole. The cheroical name for propiconazole (CAS No. 50207-90-1) is 1<br>
[[2-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-propyl-1,3-dioxolan-2-yl]methyl]-1H-1,2,4-triazole. The<br>
chemical name for tebuconazole (CAS No. 107534-96-3) is α-[2-(4-<br>
chlorophenyl)ethyl]-α-(1,1 -dlimethy lethyl)-1H-1,2,4-triazole-1 -ethanol.<br>
[0086] Tebuconazole is commercially available from a number of sources. A<br>
particularly preferred form of tebuconazole is available from Bayer Corporation under<br>
the tradename PREVENTOL™ A8. Similarly, propiconazole is available from a<br>
number of sources. A particularly preferred form of propiconazole is available from<br>
Janssen Pharmaceutica under the tradename WOCOSEN™ TECHNICAL.<br>
[0087] In particularly preferred embodiments, the first and second non- <br>
metallic antimicrobial agents are propiconazole and tebuconazole. Either agent can<br>
be the "first" or "second"; the particular designation does not matter. For ease of<br>
discussion however, tebuconazole will generally be referred to as the first non-<br>
metallic agent and propiconazole will be the second non-metallic agent.<br>
[0088] A small quantity of a glycol may be present in the composition<br>
according to the invention if desired. Glycols can add to the stability of the emulsion<br>
and provide other benefits such as retarding foam Preferred glycols include alkyl<br><br><br>
glycols with polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, and dipropylene glycol being<br>
preferred.<br>
[0089] Water makes up the other primary component of the claimed<br>
antimicrobial composition.<br>
[0090] The antimicrobial composition according to the invention may contain<br>
other additives. Two such additives are anti-foaming agents and anti-freezing agents.<br>
[0091] Some phenols used in the practice of the invention can be susceptible<br>
to foaming depending upon the particular application. Therefore, it is envisioned that<br>
many commercial embodiments of the invention will contain anti-foarning agents.<br>
[0092] For example, this composition may be used to treat kraft paper. Such<br>
paper is used to form the outer surface on insulation. One method of treating this type<br>
of paper is to add the antimicrobial composition to the water box, a device toward the<br>
end of the paper process that returns a certain quantity of water to the paper after the<br>
paper has undergone heat based drying.<br>
[0093] The water box is often agitated due to the continuous movement of<br>
paper through it. This agitation can cause foaming upon the addition of the claimed<br>
antimicrobial compositioa Generally, the presence of foam is detrimental to the<br>
water box portion of a paper process. Therefore an anti-foaming agent is added to the<br>
composition according to the invention when the invention is used to treat paper at the<br>
water box.<br>
[0094] The paper can also be treated using a spraybar. Foam buildup in the<br>
spraybar can be detrimental to a process so an antifoaming agent can be used there as<br>
well.<br>
[0095] Preferred anti-foaming agents are ethoxylated co-polymers of<br>
polyethylene glycol. In some instances, the commercial formulations of phenols may<br>
contain a quantity of an antifoaming agent. For example, TRITON™ X-207 contains<br>
a small quantity of polyethylene glycol. Accordingly, if TRITON™ X-207 is one<br>
source of the phenol additional antifoaming agent may not be needed.<br><br><br>
[0096] Likewise, anti-freezing agents may be added to the composition<br>
according to the invention. They are used to keep the composition from freezing or<br>
becoming too viscous during transport in cold weather. In most instances a glycol<br>
will serve the function of an anti-freezing agent. A preferred anti-freezing agent is<br>
dipropylene glycol.<br>
[0097] One of the benefits of the present composition is that it provides a<br>
novel and improved platform for taking advantage of the antimicrobial properties of<br>
various azoles and tebuconazole and propiconazole in particular. For some years now<br>
those skilled in the art have: been aware ofa general synergy between tebuconazole<br>
and propiconazole. In other words, by using tebuconazole and propiconazole in<br>
combination, one can achieve a greater antimicrobial effect for a given amount of<br>
antimicrobial agent.<br>
[0098] Tebuconazole: and propiconazole are also well known for their<br>
hydrophobicity and difficulty of use in an aqueous environment. They resist forming<br>
aqueous emulsions and to the extent they can be forced into some type of aqueous<br>
emulsion the emulsions tend to be delicate and are easily destabilized (e.g., the actives<br>
form crystals in water and precipitate out or they form distinct phases with water).<br>
[0099] The composition according to the invention, however, provides a stable<br>
aqueous emulsion of a quaternary ammonium antimicrobial agent and azoles,<br>
particularly tebuconazole and propiconazole. This composition can be as dilute as<br>
about 0.02 wt. % of combined azole (e.g., 100 ppm of tebuconazole and 100 ppm of<br>
propiconazole) or as concentrated as about 50 wt. % combined azole. This<br>
characteristic provides great flexibility in how the composition may be used.<br>
[0100] Although Applicant does not wish to be bound by any particular,<br>
theory, it is believed that the quaternary ammonium compound in conjunction with<br>
the phenol provides a stabilizing effect on the two azoles. In particular,<br>
dimethylbenzyl ammonium compounds such as ONYXIDE™ 3300 have been shown<br>
to provide a stabilizing effect on aqueous emulsions having combinations of azoles<br>
such as tebuconazole and propiconazole.<br>
[0101] Turning now to more specific embodiments of the invention, the<br>
relative quantities of each of the listed components may vary to accommodate<br><br><br>
particular process requirements. Accordingly, each of the listed components may be<br>
present in different amounts depending upon the particular needs of the user. Again,<br>
those skilled in the art are fully capable of making these adjustments without undue<br>
experimentation.<br>
[0102] In preferred embodiments the quaternary ammonium antimicrobial<br>
agent is present in the overall composition in an amount between about 0.33 wt. %<br>
and 20 wt, %. In particularly preferred embodiments the quaternary ammonium<br>
antimicrobial agent is present between about 2 wt. % and 16 wt. % of the overall<br>
composition, most preferably between about 3 wt. % and 9 wt. %.<br>
[0103] Likewise, the phenol (i.e., alkyl phenol, styrenated phenol, or<br>
combinations of them) is preferably present in the overall composition in an amount<br>
between about 30 wt. % and about 80 wt. % of the total composition. In preferred<br>
embodiments the phenol is present in the composition between about 40 wt. % and<br>
about 70 wt. %, most preferably between about 45 wt. % and 65 wt. %.<br>
[0104] The first non-metallic antimicrobial agent is preferably present in the<br>
overall composition in an amount between about 5 wt. % and about 45 wt. %,- more<br>
preferably between about 12 wt. % and about 30 wt. %. As noted previously, the first<br>
non-metallic antimicrobial agent is preferably tebuconazole.<br>
[0105] The second non-metallic antimicrobial agent is preferably present in<br>
the overall composition in an amount between about 5 wt. % and about 45 wt. %,<br>
more preferably between about 12 wt. % and about 30 wt. %. As noted previously, the<br>
second non-metallic antimicrobial agent is preferably propiconazole.<br>
[0106] A small quantity of a glycol may be present in the composition<br>
according to the invention. Preferred glycols include alkyl glycols with polyethylene .<br>
glycol, polypropylene glycol, and dipropylene glycol being preferred. Dipropylene<br>
glycol is particularly preferred. It is anticipated that in most applications the quantity<br>
of glycol will be between about 0 wt. % and about 4 wt. %. of the total compositioa<br>
[0107] As mentioned earlier, if foaming is an issue an anti-foaming agent can<br>
be added. The anti-foaming agents suitable for use with the invention include those<br>
compounds commonly used as anti-foaming agents. In preferred embodiments an<br><br><br>
additional amount of a glycol can be added as an anti-foaming agent. The glycol used<br>
as an anti-foaming agent can be more of the same glycol discussed previously or a<br>
different glycol.<br>
. [0108] A preferred anti-foaming agent is an ethoxylated co-polymer such as<br>
polyethylene glycol which is commercially available from Cognis Corporation. It is<br>
anticipated that in most applications the quantity of anti-foaming agent needed for<br>
successful practice of the invention will range between about 0 wt. % to about 3 wt.<br>
%, more preferably between about 0.5 wt. % and 1.5 wt. %. The quantity of<br>
antifoaming agent can be adjusted upwards or downwards depending upon the<br>
particular application. Those skilled in the art can readily determine the appropriate<br>
quantity of antifoaming agent to use without undue experimentation.<br>
[0109] The remainder of the composition according to the invention comprises<br>
water. In preferred embodiments the quantity of water present in the claimed<br>
composition will be between about 0 wt. % and about 15 wt. %, more preferably <br>
between about 3 wt. % and. about 9 wt. %. Again, the exact quantity of water will<br>
depend upon the particular application and those skilled in the art are capable of<br>
making the necessary adjustments.<br>
[0110] Further embodiments of the invention include those products that<br>
incorporate the claimed antimicrobial composition. Indeed, one of the novel aspects<br>
of the invention is that it serves as a very versatile tool for incorporating antimicrobial<br>
agents into a variety of diverse products. For example, the antimicrobial composition<br>
according to the invention has been shown to be particularly effective at imparting<br>
antimicrobial characteristics to paper used in the production of wallboard and<br>
insulation.<br>
[0111] Preliminary work also indicates that the antimicrobial composition<br>
according to the invention is an excellent tool for providing antimicrobial protection<br>
to products such as paint and polymers, with latex exterior paints and extruded vinyl.<br>
 (e.g., vinyl siding, vinyl windows) being particularly suitable for use with the<br>
invention. It is also anticipated that the antimicrobial composition according to the<br>
invention can be added to other solids such as ceramics and cementitious binders to<br>
impart antimicrobial characteristics.<br><br><br>
[0112] The invention also encompasses a method of making an antimicrobial<br>
composition. In broad terms, the method according to the invention comprises the<br>
steps of blending a phenol with a quaternary ammonium antimicrobial agent. Heat<br>
may be necessary during this blending step and particularly if the phenol is an alkyl<br>
phenol and the quaternary agent is an N-alkyl dimethylbenzyl ammonium compound.<br>
To this phenol/quaternary mixture is admixed a quantity of a first non-metallic<br>
antimicrobial agent then a quantity of a second non-metallic antimicrobial agent. The<br>
first and second non-metallic agents can also be mixed together prior to mixing with,<br>
the phenol/quaternary mixture. Toward the end of the process a quantity of water is<br>
added with mixing. Heat may be added to any step if needed.<br>
[0113] In preferred embodiments that use an alkyl phenol, the alkyl phenol<br>
(e.g., TRTION™ X-207) is usually blended with the quaternary ammonium<br>
antimicrobial agent (e.g., ONYXIDE™ 3300) in the presence of heat. The heat is<br>
applied because in many instances the quaternary ammonium antimicrobial agent is a<br>
solid at room temperature. If the quaternary ammonium antimicrobial agent is a liquid<br>
or available as a flowable composition heat may still be used to aid in the mixing.<br>
Care should be taken not to heat the admixture of alkyl phenol and quaternary<br>
antimicrobial agent to a point where there is unacceptable volatilization of either. In<br>
preferred embodiments the temperature is kept below about 200 °C.<br>
[0114] If TRITON™ X-207 is the alkyl phenol and ONYXIDE™ 3300 is the<br>
antimicrobial agent, a mixing temperature of between about 65° C and about 75° C" is<br>
recommended. At this temperature the ONYXIDE™ 3300 melts into the TRITON™<br>
X-207 to form a liquid.<br>
[0115] The steps of admixing a first non-metallic antimicrobial agent and<br>
admixing a second non-metallic antimicrobial agent may occur separately..<br>
Alternatively, the first and second non-metallic antimicrobial agents can be admixed<br>
together then added to the quaternary ammonium antimicrobial agent.<br>
[0116] The admixing of the non-metallic antimicrobial agents can be'<br>
accomplished in the presence of heat, if needed. For example, WOCOSEN™<br>
TECHNICAL (i.e., propiconazole) is normally a very viscous liquid at room<br>
temperature. PREVENTOL™ A8 (i.e., tebuconazole) is normally a solid white<br><br><br>
powder at room temperature. Heating both of them will aid in the admixture to the<br>
quaternary ammonium/alkyl phenol mixture. In a preferred embodiment, the<br>
tebuconazole and propiconazole are mixed together in the presence of form a less<br>
viscous solution that can then be added to the quaternary ammonium/alkyl phenol<br>
mixture. In this, embodiment the tebuconazole and propiconazole mixture is heated to<br>
between about 65 °C and 75 °C with stirring.<br>
[0117] Heating can continue during the admixture of the non-metallic<br>
antimicrobial agents and the quaternary ammonium antimicrobial agents if needed.<br>
Glycols and any anti-foaming agents or anti-freezing agents such as those discussed<br>
previously can be added at this point.<br>
[0118] Once the quaternary ammonium antimicrobial agent, phenol, and non-<br>
metallic antimicrobial agents are mixed heat may be removed. As the admixture<br>
cools to room temperature water is added with stirring.<br>
[0119] If styrenated phenols are used in place of the alkyl phenols the method<br>
according to the invention is very similar to that recited above. The primary<br>
difference in using a styrenated phenol is that less heat may be required during<br>
mixing. Of course, the use of heat will always be somewhat dependent upon the<br>
precise active ingredients chosen by the practitioner.<br>
[0120] The relative amounts of quaternary ammonium antimicrobial agent,<br>
alkyl phenol, non-metallic antimicrobial agents, and water utilized in the practice of<br>
the method according to the invention are the same as those discussed in relation to<br>
the composition according to the invention. Likewise, the relative amounts of anti-<br>
foaming agents, anti-freezing agents, and additional antimicrobial agents, if any, are<br>
the same as those discussed in relation to the composition according to the inventioa<br>
[0121] An alternative embodiment of the invention is particularly well suited<br>
for use in non-aqueous systems. In this embodiment the invention comprises a non-<br>
aqueous microemulsion. The microemulsion comprises a quaternary ammonium<br>
antimicrobial agent, a first non-metallic antimicrobial agent, a second non-metallic<br>
antimicrobial agent, and a glycol. The preferred quaternary ammonium antimicrobial<br>
agent, first non-metallic antimicrobial agent, and second non-metallic antimicrobial<br><br><br>
agent are the same as in the previous embodiment. Almost any glycol can be used in<br>
the practice of the invention but dipropylene glycol is a preferred glycol.<br>
[0122] The preferred quantities of each element in the composition according<br>
to the invention is as follows: first non-metallic antimicrobial agent - about 10 wt. %<br>
to about 33 wt. %; second non-metallic antimicrobial agent - about 10 wt. % to about<br>
33 wt. %; quaternary ammonium antimicrobial agent - about 0.33 wt. % to about 17<br>
wt. %; glycol - about 17 wt. % to about 80 wt. %.<br>
[0123] The method of making this embodiment of the invention is generally<br>
similar to the method of making the aqueous embodiment. The various components<br>
are mixed together in the appropriate quantities in the presence of heat, if needed. For<br>
example, several samples of the composition according to the invention were made in<br>
the following manner.<br>
[0124] The first non-metallic antimicrobial agent (e.g., WOCOSEN<br>
TECHNICAL) was blended with dipropylene glycol under heat (approximately 65 °C)<br>
in the desired relative amounts. To this mixture was added the quaternary ammonium<br>
compound (e.g., ONYXEDE 3300) while maintaining heat. The second non-metallic<br>
antimicrobial agent (e.g.. PREVENTOL A8) was then added with heat and mixing.<br>
The entire mixture was then stirred under heat until a clear microemulsion was<br>
formed.<br>
[0125] The above non-aqueous embodiment of the invention is well suited for<br>
imparting antimicrobial characteristics to products produced in a non-aqueous<br>
environment.<br><br>
Example<br>
[0126] The following formulation, made in accordance with the above<br>
method, has shown commercially acceptable efficacy against the proliferation of<br>
microbes on kraft paper. All percentages are weight percentages.<br>
[0127] Tebuconazole (WOCOSEN™ TECHNICAL)	19%<br>
[0128] Propiconazole (PREVENTOL™ A8)	18.5%<br><br>
[0129] Quaternary Ammonium (ONYXIDE™ 3300)	9.5 %<br>
 [0130] Alkyl Phenol (TRITON™ X-207)	43%.<br>
[0131] Glycol (dipropylene glycol)	5%<br>
[0132] Water	5%<br>
Adhesive<br>
[0133] The adhesive that attaches, the fiberglass batting to the non-woven<br>
covering may also serve as a carrier for antimicrobial compositions. Several types of<br>
adhesives may be used depending upon the physical and chemical characteristics of<br>
the insulation and the non-woven covering. In preferred embodiments, however, the<br>
adhesive is an asphalt or tar-like compound such as those that are commonly used in<br>
the manufacture of insulation.<br>
[0134] In most instances, the antimicrobial compositions can be added to the<br>
adhesive prior to application of the adhesive to the non woven covering. Simple<br>
mixing or blending of the antimicrobial agent with the adhesive will probably be the .<br>
most effective method of addition in most instances. Other methods of combining the<br>
antimicrobial composition with adhesives will be readily apparent to those skilled in<br>
the art.<br>
[0135] The antimicrobial compositions that can be used in combination with<br>
the adhesive include all of those discussed previously, including the preferred<br>
antimicrobial compositions. Preferred embodiments utilize an antimicrobial<br>
composition that includes agents selected from the group consisting of triclosan,<br>
propiconazole, sodium pyrithione, tolyl diiodomethyl sulfone; tebuconazole;<br>
thiabendazole; 3-iodo-2-propynyl butylcarbamate, metal ions, n-octyl-isothiazolinone,<br>
quaternary ammonium compounds, and mixtures thereof. N-octyl-isothiazolinone<br>
(OIT) and silver ions or silver zeolites are particularly preferred.<br>
[0136] The weight percent of antimicrobial composition in the adhesive may<br>
vary from very little (e.g., less than 100 ppm)to very great (e.g., over 5000 ppm). The<br>
exact amount will depend upon the particular use of the insulation and the amount of<br>
antimicrobial composition used in conjunction with the non-woven covering.<br><br>
Method<br>
[01371 The invention also encompasses a method of manufacturing insulation<br>
which exhibits antimicrobial properties. The various examples set forth above discuss<br>
several methods of manufacture (e.g., spraying the non-woven covering). The above<br>
discussed methods are exemplary only and should not be interpreted as limiting the<br>
scope of the invention.<br>
[0138] In very broad terms the method according to the invention comprises<br>
the steps of applying an antimicrobial composition to the non-woven covering and<br>
contacting a non-woven covering to an insulating material. The order of these steps<br>
may be reversed if such reversal is better suited to the overall process.<br>
[0139] The step of contacting the non-woven covering to the insulating<br>
material includes any contacting step currently used in the industry. Such steps could<br>
include melt pressing synthetic polymer non-woven coverings to insulation or coating<br>
a non-woven covering with an adhesive then contacting the non-woven covering to<br>
the insulation. The use of tar like adhesives to contact paper coverings to fiberglass<br>
batting is probably the most commonly used method in the industry.<br>
[0140] Likewise, the step of applying an antimicrobial composition to the non-<br>
woven covering comprises any of the methods discussed above including spraying,<br>
coating, dipping, etc. or otherwise contacting the antimicrobial composition to the<br>
non-woven covering. Adding the antimicrobial composition to an adhesive prior to or<br>
concurrent with contacting the non-woven covering to the adhesive is also included in<br>
the scope of this step.<br>
[0141] Lastly, the antimicrobial compositions utilized in the method according<br>
to the invention include all of those antimicrobial compositions capable of providing a<br>
commercially acceptable level of efficacy against the microbe of concern. Particularly<br>
preferred embodiments of the method include the specific antimicrobial compositions<br>
discussed above.<br><br>
