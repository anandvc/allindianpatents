				<td>ROTARY VALVE ASSEMBLY<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
(a)	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a rotary valve assembly, and<br>
particularly to a rotary valve assembly having a rotor to control oil<br>
flowing to a prescribed valve thereof.<br>
(b)	Description of the Prior Art<br>
Electromagnetic valves, which are activated by electric power, are<br>
often used in conventional hydraulic valve systems for switching oil<br>
supply path. In the event that the electromagnetic valves are out of<br>
work or that electric power aborts, the hydraulic valve systems can not<br>
switch oil supply path properly.<br>
As shown in Fig. 11, an operation table 10 includes manifold tables 101,<br>
which respectively have hydraulic valve systems to adjust location and<br>
direction thereof, thereby supporting a patient thereon at an appropriate<br>
position complying with need. For an operation process, it is significant to<br>
control the manifold tables 101 freely and exactly during the whole process.<br>
Electromagnetic valves are unreliable to control the operation table 10 during<br>
the whole process.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a rotary<br>
valve assembly which connects with bi-directional oil supply and which<br>
has a rotor being rotatable by manual operation or electric power to<br>
form a predetermined oil supply path precisely.<br>
The rotary valve assembly of the present invention comprises a valve<br>
body, a rotor and a plurality of guidance check valves. The valve body<br>
includes a valve seat longitudinally defining a bore through a center<br>
thereof. A plurality of valve oil passages and a main oil passage are<br>
respectively distributed radially around the bore. The rotor is movably<br>
received in the bore of the valve body. A plurality of guidance check<br>
valves is mounted in the valve oil passages. The rotor rotates to switch<br>
a predetermined valve position by manual operation or electric power,<br>
where a predetermined oil supply path is precisely formed to supply oil<br>
to a predetermined valve communicating with a valve oil passage.<br>
A discharging passage is defined in the rotor. When oil supply<br>
provides oil for the valve oil passages, the discharging passage guides<br>
the leaked oil into the oil supply, thereby avoiding oil leaking out of the<br>
valve body.<br>

211. Annular grooves 22 are defined in an outer peripheral of the rotor 2<br>
for respectively corresponding to the first orifice 131 and the second<br>
orifice 132. At least a leading hole 221 is defined radially at bottoms of<br>
the annular grooves 22 and communicates with a center hole 21.<br>
Guiding holes 23 are defined in the rotor 2 for respectively<br><br>
communicating the inlet channel 121 and the outlet channel 122 of the<br>
valve oil passages 12 with the bore 11. A plurality of rotor seals 24 are<br>
provided between the annular grooves 22 and the guiding holes 23. At<br>
least an activation element 25 is mounted on an end of the rotor 2 for<br>
external operation.<br>
Referring to Figs. 1 and 6, each guidance check valve 3 includes a<br>
movable rod 31, a first and a second check valve spherical seats 32, 32',<br>
a first and a second balls 33, 33', and four springs 34. The rod 31 is<br>
column, and forms a first and a second conical thimbles 311, 311' on<br>
opposite ends thereof. Movable gaskets 312 are provided around the<br>
first and the second thimbles 311, 311' and between two springs 34 at<br>
same side of the rod 31, and define notches therein. The first and the<br>
second spherical seats 32, 32' are annular and hollow. Valve seals 321<br>
are provided around middles of the first and the second spherical seats<br>
32, 32'. Through holes 322 (shown in Fig 7 are defined radially in<br>
peripherals of the first and the second spherical seats 32, 32'. Valve<br>
holes 323 are respectively defined in centers of the first and the second<br>
spherical seats 32, 32', and each have a diameter increasing from an<br>
end toward another end. In assembly, the rod 31 extends into the<br>
connecting hole 123 where the connecting hole 123 has a smallest<br><br>
width, the springs 34 circling the first and the second thimbles 311, 311'<br>
respectively. The gaskets 312 pass resiliency force of the springs 34 to<br>
the ends of the rod 31. The first and the second spherical seats 32, 32'<br>
are respectively mounted on opposite ends of the rod 31 where the<br>
connecting hole 123 has a width larger than the smallest width thereof.<br>
The first and the second balls 33, 33' respectively fit within the valve<br>
holes 323 of the first and the second spherical seats 32, 32'. Bolts 35<br>
are provided to block the connecting hole 123 adjacent both ends of the<br>
guidance check valve 3 and abut the spherical seats 32, 32', as shown<br>
in Fig. 7. Rod seals (not shown) are provided around the rod 31.<br>
The rotor 2 is movably extends through the bore 11, with ends of the<br>
rotor 2 being respectively accommodated in the seat seals 111.<br>
Disengagement prevention elements 14 are mounted on outward sides<br>
of the seat seals 111. The guidance check valves 3 are mounted in the<br>
valve oil passages 12. The rotor 2 rotates and locates at a<br>
predetermined valve position by manual operation or electric operation,<br>
forming a predetermined oil supply path easily and properly. Referring to<br>
Fig. 10, the rotor 2 is assembled on the valve body 1, and is operated<br>
like a button.<br>
In order to employ a predetermined oil supply path, the rotor 2 rotates<br><br>
to switch to a predetermined valve position. Oil from the oil supply flows,<br>
through the first orifice 131 of the main oil passage 13, and then the<br>
leading hole 221 and the annular groove 22, into the center hole 21.<br>
Sequentially, the oil in the center hole 21 flows, along the guiding hole<br>
23, to the inlet channel 121 of the valve oil passage 12. Oil flows from<br>
the inlet channel 121 to the connecting hole 123. Oil pressure pushes<br>
aside the rod 31 and the first ball 33 on an end thereof, as shown in<br>
Fig.9. The second thimble 311' on the other end of the rod 31 puts the<br>
second ball 33' away, and disengages the second ball 33' from the valve<br>
hole 323. As a result, the oil flows from the inlet channel 121, through<br>
the valve hole 323 and the through holes 322 of the first spherical seat<br>
32, and out of the outlet channel 122. The oil discharges from the outlet<br>
channel 122, through the valve hole 323 and the through holes 322 of<br>
the second spherical seat 32' and the guiding hole 23 in turn, and into<br>
the center hole 21. Then the oil flows through the leading hole 221, the<br>
annular groove 22 and the second orifice 132, and returns to oil supply.<br>
A discharging passage 15 is defined in the rotor 2 and communicates<br>
with the annular grooves 22. When oil supply provides oil for the valve<br>
oil passages 12, the discharging passage 15 guides the leaked oil into<br>
the oil supply, thereby avoiding oil leaking out of the valve body 1.<br><br>
The rotor 2 rotates to switch to different predetermined oil supply<br>
paths by external operation, for example, manual operation or electric<br>
power. The guiding holes 23 rotate with the rotor 2 to be aligned with<br>
different valve oil passages 12. Thus the rotary valve assembly switches<br>
to different predetermined oil supply paths easily and exactly.<br>
It is understood that the invention may be embodied in other forms<br>
without departing from the spirit thereof. Thus, the present examples<br>
and embodiments are to be considered in all respects as illustrative and<br>
not restrictive, and the invention is not to be limited to the details given<br>
herein.<br><br>
