				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the production of an appetizer. More specifically, it relates to a procedure for obtaining an appetizer based on nixtamalized corn (corn boiled generally with lime), nixtamalized corn dough and the product thus obtained.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the appetizer production industry there has been an explosion of new products, from simple roasted peanuts, going through potato chips. The differences among them have to do with many factors - the raw material starting from which such appetizers are made, the flavor that is added to them, the process of appetizer production, among other factors. For example, we have simple salted potato chips, which may differ according to the frying process. There are peanuts, which may be fried, roasted, only salted, or with dry and ground chili powder.<br>
With the development of food industry technology, new products have appeared, which are obtained by means of extrusion of some dough of a different composition. This technology permits obtaining products of more homogeneous characteristics and of more varied conformation and dimensions.<br>
As examples, we have the imitations of slices of potato chips, fried flours, and mixtures of flours and other raw materials, shaped as "churros" (fritters), more or less regular in their shape, and so forth.<br>
On the other hand, there are at present, basically, two products made from nixtamalized corn dough - "totopos" (corn tortillas) and the so-called "churritos" (small "churros" or small fritters). Tortillas are flakes with different sizes and shapes made from nixtamalized corn dough. "Totopos" may be triangular or round in shape. Until now, there have been no modifications to these three types of products made from nixtamalized corn dough.<br>
Wishing to gain part of the market, a nixtamalized corn dough product different from<br><br>
2<br>
those already known would be quite interesting. The modifications have consisted in adding new flavors by means of new mixtures of flavors. However, the product conformation has not been altered and this factor of generation of new products has not been developed.<br>
Conformation changes, although they mean a certain advantage due to the novelty effect on the public in general, and on the children of the public in particular, mear, also new technologies of conformation and manufacture, which is necessary to develop.<br>
Besides, the product itself, in spite of having novelty, does not mean that it will have market acceptance. Important investments are required, besides those proper to any research and development of new products and the processes to produce them, those necessary to generate tasting panels to have a precise idea of the acceptance of the new product in the market.<br>
OBJECTIVES OF THE INVENTION<br>
The main objective of this invention consists in developing a process for the production of an appetizer starting from nixtamalized corn dough, which is acceptable to the public.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for production of an appetizer comprising the steps of:<br>
(a)	adding between about 1.0 percent to 1.5 weight percent lime to a combination<br>
of water and corn to form a mixture;<br>
(b)	boiling said mixture until the corn contains between about 34 to 38 weight<br>
percent moisture;<br>
(c)	resting said boiled mixture for a time sufficient to allow the corn to reach<br>
room temperature;<br><br>
3<br>
(d)	adding moisture to the boiled-rested mixture to achieve a moisture content<br>
between about 46 to 52 percent and grinding said moisture-added mixture to obtain a<br>
homogenous dough;<br>
(e)	rolling and cooking said dough to produce the appetizer.<br>
Preferably, the corn is completely immersed in water.<br>
Preferably, the slice is formed into the shape of a pie or into the shape of a heart.<br>
Broadly speaking, one of the aspects consists in developing a process for the production of an appetizer made from nixtamalized corn dough that has the shape of a small Mexican "taco" (rolled up tortilla) and this "taco" is fried to give it the feature of being crackling, but not too greasy. Some special flavor can also be provided to it with a flavoring composition.<br>
Once the product has been defined starting from marketing studies, and once the product has been defined in a first instance, the process for obtaining the same required multiple tests. Production of the small "taco" from the small raw tortilla meant barriers unlikely to be overcome due to the impossibility of giving a perfect rolling up to the product before frying it.<br>
It was decided then to produce the rolling up of the tortilla while still raw. In the beginning it was thought to use the tortilla with a round conformation, which had the inconvenience that it turned out to be too thick in the center. This, on the one hand, represented the problem of frying it, since it kept too much grease that was not accepted by the public and meant a higher production cost.<br>
To solve this problem, it was found in a novel and indeed intelligent manner that it could be solved by providing the conformation to the small raw tortilla, of a slice of pie (triangular) or the form of a caricature of a heart.<br>
This solved the problem quite well; however, the consistency of the dough was not adequate to provide it a certain superficial adherence and thus facilitate rolling up by the raw tortilla adhering appropriately to the surface of the element with which the rolling up was performed. Besides, this consistency permitted rolling up without breaking the small tortilla.<br>
Besides such consistency, an adequate caliber of such small tortilla was sought so that the process would work well.   It was found that the optimum caliber of the same<br><br>
4<br>
should be of approximately 1 mm, and such caliber could vary up to 2 mm. A smaller thickness would mean problems for its conformation and a caliber greater than 2 mm would have flying problems by keeping too much grease, a longer frying time, and a harder consistency.<br>
The nixtamalization process of the corn and the grinding of the same should be the<br>
optimum ones to obtain a good consistency.  In this process, the parameters of time<br>
and temperature of nixtamalization should be such as to obtain in the grain a moisture<br>
of about 34 to 38%. It was found that the amount of lime added for nixtamalization<br>
should be between 1.0 and 1.5% in weight with respect to the dry weight of corn. The<br>
resting time of the nixtamalization corn will vary between 12 and 16 hours, the time<br>
required to obtain a moisture in the grain of about 48 to 50 %.<br>
In any case, grinding should be performed such as not to have a sandy consistency to the touch. That is, that the size of the particle should be such that it is not detected by touch. The amount of moisture to be added when grinding, if this is necessary, should be enough in order for there to be 50% moisture in the dough obtained. This resulted in a flexible tortilla with a good characteristie of surface adherence to make rolling up possible.<br>
Another feasible option is the utilization of nixtamalized corn flour to shape the small raw tortilla in the defined conformation, the rheologic features of the dough made from the grinding of nixtamalized corn and that of the dough made from reconstituted nixtamalized com flour are quite different, since the flour has a greater absorption of water than the dough.<br>
The final product should have a percentage of grease of approximately 34% in weight to ensure adequate frying.<br><br>
4A<br>
The level and uniformity of the quality of the com grain used as raw material for the nixtamalizacion (corn boiling process) is determinative of the quality of the end product. The establishment of maximum range of variability in the characteristics of the grain may be useful to optimize processes even though an increase of the cost of corn may be incurred. Broken grains make diffusion of humidity in the corn boiling process to be faster, compared to the boiling process of the whole grains providing for a result a non-homogenous nixtarnal, or boiled corn. However, the amount of broken grains must not exceed two percent (2%).<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the method of the subject invention, in order to make a cocido or boil, 1000 liters of water must be put in the cooking bowl, this quantity of water will guarantee that the 900 kilograms of corn will be fully covered, achieving a more homogenous boiling. The corn, water and lime mixture boils at between about 91 to 93° C or between about 196 to 200° F.<br>
Boiling the corn allows to hydrate the grain to smooth the pericarp, to denaturalize proteins and to partially gelatinize the starch. The hardness of the endosperm partially determines the speed of water penetration during boiling. The soft grains are rapidly hydrated, requiring short periods of boiling, but they are very sensitive to overcooking. Intermediate to high hardness grains are adequate for the nixtamalizacion or corn boiling process due to the fact that they have a higher margin of control of the process. The easiness by which the pericarp is eliminated during the corn boiling process affects the permeability of the grain in the water. When the pericarp is eliminated or easily and rapidly softened during the boiling process, penetration of water is fast and the grain soon boils. Therefore, retaining the pericarp in the final product may result in a major cohesiveness.<br>
In order to achieve retention of pericarp, in the preferred embodiment of the subject invention, twelve (12) kilograms of calcium hydroxide (lime) are added to the water, and<br><br>
4B<br>
the water begins to be stirred. By adding this amount of calcium hydroxide, an adequate gelatinization level is reached. The gelatinization level determines viscosity, adhesiveness and cohesiveness of the dough obtained after grinding.<br>
Water vapor is used as heating means during the entire process. The total boiling time includes from the moment water is added and until such time the bowl is removed to the resting area and in the preferred embodiment is about 44 minutes. The effective boiling time of the mixture (water, calcium hydroxide and corn) is 17 minutes to achieve a 34 to 36% humidity percentage of the grain.<br>
In order to stop the gelatinization process and to prevent overcooking, cold water is added until an approximate temperature of 70° C is reached. Once the boiling process is finished, corn, water and lime mixture is left to rest for 12 to 16 hours in order for the nixtamal (boiled corn) to reach a humidity percentage of 46 to 50%.<br>
After the resting or soaking period, washing the nixtamal (boiled corn) eliminates the pericarp already softened, the excess of calcium hydroxide, and water used during boiling nixtamalizacion (corn boiling process). Washing must be as uniform as possible and it should take the nixtamal to a temperature below 35° C with as little water as possible.<br>
The mixture produces corn dough composed of various types of particles including fragments of grain, pericarps and germs, as well as starch, proteins and hydrated fibers, having a humidity of 46 to 52% is then grinded. The condition of the nixtamal (boiled corn), the type of stone, the separation between stones, and the added water, are factors to be controlled during the grinding process.<br>
The grinding of overcooked nixtamal (boiled corn), with high humidity content, generates heat excess and tends to produce sticky dough that dries quickly and cannot be<br><br>
4C<br>
laminated. The purpose of grinding is to obtain fine and homogeneous dough that allows us to achieve a product with a fat absorption within our quality specifications, between 27 and 30% of fat absorption, and good enough to be eaten. The dough temperature must not exceed 55° C at no more than 70 amperes in the ammeter of the grind.<br>
The dough is then shaped. It is in this stage where a great part of the effects of the aforementioned boiling, washing and grinding processes are reflected. It is also important to perform a plastizado in order to obtain an improvement of the consistency of the dough, and the adequate adjustment of the rolling pins and the shaper of the laminator, in order to obtain a product figure with an average weight of 2.8 grams to 3.6 grams.<br>
If an adequate level of humidity of the dough is not achieved, the product turns fragile and cannot be rolled. If the humidity level of the dough is exceeded, the dough turns sticky and cannot be cast in the mould, remaining stuck to the laminating rolling pins. The dough is passed through metal trays in order to roll it, and to have the appearance of a Mexican taco. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the trays that roll the tortilla are 16 centimeters long and 2.6 centimeters wide. The cast used to make the figures is 10 figures wide, each figure measures 7.5 centimeters by 5.5 centimeters. The cast is 90 centimeters wide. The tray that takes the figure to the trays that roll them works at 102 r.p.m.<br>
To bake, the figure is passed through a three step oven with a temperature between 600 and 670°F for 42 to 50 seconds, the lower the temperature, the higher the resistance time of the figure in the oven and viceversa. By the end of this process, a tortilla with an acceptable color, and a humidity percentage of 37 to 40% is obtained. After this process, the tortilla is too hot, therefore it is necessary to lower its temperature before it is taken to the flying machine. The entrance to the frying machine is delayed for a period of 3 to 3.25 minutes, passing the tortilla through a stabilizer, which is a three step equipment<br><br>
4D<br>
where  the  tortilla  transfers  the  heat to  the  air  in  the  environment,  reducing to approximately 35° C.<br>
During the frying process there is exchange from water to oil in the tortilla. Hence, the adequate level of oil in the frying machine must be carefully taken care of, adding continuously oil to the frying machine. It is also important to remove the remains that may be left at the bottom of the frying machine in every moment during the process, as well as to take care of the free fat acids. Frying is performed at a temperature of 195 to 205° C for 140 to 190 seconds, thus obtaining a fried tortilla with a humidity percentage of between 1.5 and 2% and a fat absorption of between 27 and 30%.<br>
In a final stage, seasoning may be added to the fried product by means of a seasoning curtain, spinning the product in a cylinder to have a uniform distribution in all the flying product. A fried product with a fat percentage of between 2.1 and 2.5% is obtained.<br><br>

EXAMPLES EXAMPLE 1.<br>
The corn was nixtamalized with 0.75% of lime with respect to the dry weight of corn; the boiling time and temperature required to obtain the moisture from 34 to 38% in<br>
weight in the grain were too much; it was left resting until it reached room temperature. When grinding the grain down to such a degree, that the granules were no longer perceptible to the touch, this resulted in a dough that when reaching 50% moisture, was not malleable. The dough was very loose.<br>
EXAMPLE 2.<br>
The com was nixtamalized with 2.0% lime with respect to the dry weight of corn, and the boiling time and temperature required to obtain the moisture from 34 to 38% in weight in the grain; it was left resting until it reached room temperature. When grinding the grain down to a degree such that the granules were no longer perceptible to the touch, this resulted in a dough of adequate consistency, but it turned out to have unacceptable flavor and color.<br>
EXAMPLE 3.<br>
The corn nixtamalized with 1.5% lime with respect to the dry weight of corn, and the boiling time and temperature required to obtain moisture from 34 to 38% in weight in the grain; it was left resting until reached room temperature. When grinding the grain down to a degree such that the granules were no longer perceptible to the touch, this resulted in a dough of adequate consistency, with acceptable flavor and color.<br>
EXAMPLE 4.<br><br>
6<br>
The corn was nixtamalized with 1.0% lime with respect to the dry weight of corn, and the boiling time and temperature required to obtain moisture from 34 to 38% in weight In the grain; it was left resting until it reached room temperature. When grinding the grain, down to a degree such that the granules were no longer perceptible to the touch, this resulted in a dough of adequate consistency, with acceptable flavor and color.<br>
EXAMPLE 5. <br>
The corn was nixtamalized with 1,0% lime with respect to the dry weight of corn, and the boiling time and temperature required to obtain 25% moisture in weight in the grain; it was left resting until it reached room temperature. When grinding the grain down to a degree such that the granules were no longer perceptible to the touch and adding water up to 50%, this resulted in a dough of loose consistency that could not be handled, and fell apart, or was even unable to form the small tortilla.<br>
EXAMPLE 6.<br>
The corn was nixtamalized with 1,0% lime with respect to the dry weight of corn, and the boiling time and temperature required to contain 40% moisture in weight in the grain; it was left resting until it reached room temperature. When grinding the grain down to a degree such that the granules were no longer perceptible to the touch, and adding water up to 50%, this resulted in a dough of chewing gum consistency that could not be handled, adhered to any surface, and could not form the small tortilla.<br>
EXAMPLE 7.<br>
The corn was nixtanialized with 1.0% lime with respect to the dry weight of corn, and the boiling time and temperature required to obtain 34% moisture in weight in the<br><br>
7<br>
grain; it was left resting until it reached room temperature. When grinding the grain down to a degree such that the granules were no longer perceptible to the touch and adding water up to 50%, this resulted in a dough of adequate consistency for forming the small tortilla.<br>
EXAMPLE 8.<br>
The corn was nixtamalized with 1.0% lime with respect to the dry weight of corn, and the boiling time required to obtain 38% moisture in weight in the grain. It was left resting until it reached room temperature. When grinding the grain down to a degree such that the granules were no longer perceptible to the touch and adding water up to 50%, this resulted in a dough of adequate consistency for forming the small tortilla.<br>
EXAMPLE 9.<br>
The corn was nixtamalized with 1.0% lime with respect to the dry weight of corn, and the boiling time required to obtain 38% moisture in weight in the grain. It was left resting until it reached room temperature. When grinding the grain down to a degree such that the granules were no longer perceptible to the touch and adding water up to 45%, this resulted in a dough of adequate consistency to form the small tortilla and perform rolling up of the same.<br>
EXAMPLE 10.<br>
The corn was nixtamalized with 1.0% lime with respect to the dry weight of corn, and the boiling time required to obtain 38% moisture in weight in the grain; the consistency of the dough, when grinding the grain down to a degree such that the granules were no longer perceptible to the touch and adding water up to 40%, this resulted in a dough of fragile and dry consistency for forming the small tortilla and for performing rolling up of the same.<br><br>
e<br>
EXAMPLE 11.<br>
The corn was nixtamalized with 1.0% lime with respect to the dry weight of corn, and the boiling time required to obtain 38% moisture in weight in the grain; the consistency of the dough, when grinding the grain down to a degree such that the granules were no longer perceptible to the touch and adding water up to 50%, this resulted in a dough of chewing gum consistency with an excessive gelatinization of starch, which caused multiple problems to form the small tortilla and perform rolling up of the same.<br>
EXAMPLE 12.<br>
Nixtamalized corn flour was reconstituted by adding water up to 50%; this resulted in a dough of adequate consistency to form the small tortilla and perform rolling up of the same.<br>
