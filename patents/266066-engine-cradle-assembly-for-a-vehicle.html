PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION <br>
             The following specification describes the invention<br><br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates in general to frame assemblies for vehicles. More specifically it relates to an improved structure for an engine cradle system for use in a vehicle.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Engine cradle is removable section of a vehicle frame that fastens under the bottom of the vehicle body. Engine cradle is usually mounted at the bottom of a vehicle body at the front or the rear. For example in a front engine type vehicle, front suspension and an engine are mounted on a subframe at the front side of the vehicle body, and in a rear engine type vehicle rear suspension and an engine along with a differential gear unit are mounted on a subframe at the rear side of the vehicle body. US 6076625, US 5280957 &amp; US 4263980 have demonstrated such engine cradle designs.<br>
The primary requirement from the cradle assembly structure is to provide sufficient strength and stiffness. Strength of the structure is paramount since the cradle assembly is subjected to very large mechanical stresses due to the weight of the engine and load of the vehicle transferred to the cradle assembly from the suspension. Stiffness of the structure is required in order to have effective isolation of powertrain and road induced vibrations.<br>
Conventionally the cradle assembly is typically made from a pair of spaced side frame members having front and rear ends, a front cross frame member connected across the front ends of the side frame members, and a rear cross frame member extending between the rear ends of the side frame members. The individual components are metallic pieces which are generally stamped then welded together to form the final engine cradle. More recently the cradle assemblies have been formed from a single tubular component generally a U-shaped member using the process of expansion shaping, commonly referred to as<br><br><br>
hydroforming. Hydroforming is a process which uses pressurized fluid to deform a tubular member into a desired shape. To accomplish this, the tubular member is initially disposed between two die sections of a hydroforming apparatus which, when closed together, define a die cavity having a desired final shape. Thereafter, the tubular member is filled with a pressurized fluid, typically a relatively incompressible liquid such as water. The pressure of the fluid is increased to a magnitude where the tubular member is expanded outwardly into conformance with the die cavity. As a result, the tubular member is deformed into the desired final shape. Hydroforming is an advantageous process for forming engine cradles and other structures because it can quickly deform a single component into a desired shape. US 5884722 describes one such U-shaped cradle following the hydroforming guidelines established in the prior art.<br>
The engine cradle is usually mounted to the vehicle frame with bolts. In order to prevent the collapse of the two spaced apart flanges when the bolt is tightened, a spacer is provided between the two flanges. The spacer is in the form of a tube sleeved on the bolt. The spaced flanges provide a stiff attachment which is very rigid and forms a strong joint to have least vibration and noise. US 6085856 describes one such arrangement. The spacers provide desirable strength and rigidity to the hollow ends of the engine cradle, but also add undesirable expense.<br>
The assembly of engine cradle also presents situation wherein a gap is disposed between two structures that are to be fastened together. The gap may be variably sized due to part to part manufacturing related variations. The gaps are undesirable as it may render the joint susceptible to flexure. One of the methods employed is to utilize the clamping force that is generated by a fastener to deform one or both of the structures to eliminate the gap. The drawback of this method is that the amount of clamping force that is absorbed by the deformation of one or both of the structures is not quantifiable and moreover the deformation in the structure due to clamping force will cause preloading which is not good from durability point of view.<br><br><br>
Further requirement from cradle assemblies is that they should be dimensionally accurate in series production. This is evidently required from maintaining consistency of performance of suspension system as well as that of powertrain mounting system.<br>
In addition to catering to the afore said diverse requirements the cradle assemblies are also required to have drain holes at desired locations in order to have efficient corrosion resistant coating at both outer as well as inner surfaces of the tubular structure.<br>
OBJECTS OF INVENTION<br>
The main object of this invention is to provide an engine cradle for a vehicle with provisions for mounting engine assembly, gearbox assembly, suspension system and cooling system and exhaust system.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide engine cradle for a vehicle with high dimensional accuracies for suspension and engine mounting hardpoints as well as other attachment points in series production<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide an engine cradle for a vehicle with means for attaching an engine cradle to a vehicle body capable of having stiffer joint, thereby reducing vibration and noise.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide an engine cradle for a vehicle which can be accessed easily.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide an engine cradle for a vehicle which is simple in construction and cost effective.<br><br><br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
The engine cradle for a vehicle in accordance with this invention basically comprises of at least four tubular members namely a pair of side members, a front cross member and a rear cross member. The front cross member is connected with front ends of the side members. The rear cross member extends between rear ends of the side members. The front cross member and the pair of side members are formed by using mechanical bending and hydroforming techniques. Said tubular members and attachment elements are provided such that they are improved structurally so that an improved engine cradle for vehicles is obtained.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
Referring now to the drawings wherein the showings are for the purpose of illustrating a preferred embodiment of the invention only, and not for the purpose of limiting the same,<br>
Referring to figs. l to 17 engine cradle assembly consists of front cross member (2), left side member (3), right side member (4), rear cross member (5), suspension inner pivot bracket (6), suspension outer pivot bracket (7), radiator mounting bracket (8), engine mount bracket (9), central connection bracket (10) wherein the end portions of left side member (3) and right side member (4) are joined to front cross member (2) and rear cross member thus forming a quadrilateral structure. Front cross member (2), left side member (3) and right side member (4) are manufactured by mechanical bending and hydroforming techniques.<br><br><br>
Front cross member (2) is hydroformed such that it has rectangular sections (11, 12) at the end mounting location (13) and center mounting locations (14) as shown in fig. 3 and fig. 4. The rectangular sections (11, 12) provide flat resting/contact area (15) for bolting. Additionally the front cross member (2) has elliptical sections at the intermediate lengths between the end (13) and central (14) mounting areas. A depression (16) is also provided on the front cross member (2) to have improved clearances. Suspension outer pivot bracket (7), suspension inner pivot bracket (6) and engine mount bracket (9) are fitted to the front. The dimensional accuracy of suspension hardpoints is better achieved in this design since the hydroform pipe is straight and without any bends so no spring-back related issues are encountered. Additionally, the elliptical section in the intermediate lengths of suspension cross member is oriented such as to have maximum stiffness for engine mounting and suspension mounting. Holes (17, 18 &amp; 19, 20) are mechanically drilled or hydropierced at the end mounting location (13) and center mounting locations (14) as shown in fig. 3 and fig. 4 to receive sheet metal reinforcement (21). Holes (17, 19) are bigger in diameter as compared to holes (18, 20). Sheet metal reinforcement (21) is fitted such that the flange of sheet metal reinforcement is welded to suspension cross member (2) surface on the bigger hole (17, 19) side. The sheet metal reinforcement provides a low cost stiffening arrangement compared to machined collared sleeves which are conventionally used.<br>
Left side member (3) is manufactured from tubular stock by mechanical bending and hydroforming such that it has rectangular cross section with bends as shown in fig. 7 and fig. 8. Holes (22, 23) are mechanically drilled or hydropierced at the powertrain mounting locations (24) to receive sheet metal reinforcement (25). Hole (22) is bigger in diameter as compared to hole (23). Sheet metal reinforcement (25) are fitted such that the flange of sheet metal reinforcement is welded to left side member (3) surface on the bigger hole (22) side. An elliptical notch (28) at front end (26) of left side member (3) and rectangular notch (29) at rear end (27) of the left side member (3) is provided for fitting the left side member (3) to front cross member (2) and rear cross member (5) respectively.<br><br><br>
Right side member (4) is manufactured from tubular stock by mechanical bending and hydroforming such that it has rectangular cross section with bends as shown in side view shown in fig. 5 and fig. 6. Holes (30, 31) are mechanically drilled or hydropierced at the powertrain mounting locations (32) to receive sheet metal reinforcement (33). Hole (30) is bigger in diameter as compared to hole (31). Sheet metal reinforcements (33) are fitted such that the flange of sheet metal reinforcement is welded to right side member (4) surface on the bigger hole (30) side. An elliptical notch (36) at front end (34) of right side member (4) and rectangular notch (37) at rear end (35) of the right side member (4) is provided for fitting the right side member (4) to front cross member (2) and rear cross member (5) respectively.<br>
Rear cross member (5) is made by conventional tubular stock and is preferably having rectangular cross section. It has holes (39) drilled at the end mounting locations (38). Sheet metal reinforcement (40) is inserted from side openings and fitted at the mounting locations. Radiator mounting brackets (8) are fitted on one side of the rear cross member (5).<br>
Referring to fig. 12 central connection bracket (10) comprises of horizontal surface (41), vertical surface (42) and side walls (43). Horizontal surface (41) and vertical surface (42) have a oblong holes (44, 45) with diameter bigger than bolting fastener diameter. Central connection bracket (10) is pre bolted to suspension cross member (2) using bolt (47) and nut (46).<br>
Front cross member end mounting attachment to vehicle body is now explained. Referring to fig. 15 the front cross member end mounting attachment comprises of vehicle body long member (48), external reinforcement (49), internal reinforcement (50) and threaded spacer (51) such that external reinforcement (49) is fitted to vehicle body long member (48). Internal reinforcement (50) and threaded spacer (51) subassembly is fitted to interior surfaces of external reinforcement (49) to receive bolting fastener (52). The mounting is done such that the top flat surface () of suspension cross member (2) engages with bottom<br><br><br>
surface (53) of external reinforcement (49). When bolting fastener (52) is tightened the attachment is completed and a stiff and low cost arrangement is obtained.<br>
Referring to fig. 13 and fig. 14 front cross member central mounting attachment to vehicle body comprises of central tunnel member (54), threaded sleeve (55) and internal reinforcement (56) such that internal reinforcement (56) and threaded sleeve (55) subassembly is fitted to internal surfaces of central tunnel member (54) to receive bolting fastener (57). The attachment is obtained by engaging central connection bracket (10) with central tunnel member (54) and fastening the bolt (57). The oblong holes (44, 45) on central connection bracket take care of dimensional variations in all three directions due to manufacturing process. This means that the connection is not preloaded and there is no flexure at the joint. Presence of central attachment between cradle assembly and vehicle body improves stiffness of engine mounting bracket. Additionally it helps in improving lateral stiffness of rear suspension resulting in better handling.<br>
Fig. 16 and fig. 17 shows rear cross tube end mounting attachment. It comprises of vehicle body side bracket (58) having a bolting hole fitted to vehicle body long member. The attachment is accomplished by engaging bottom surface of bracket (59) with top surface of rear cross member and fastening the two using bolt (60) and nut (61).<br>
All the vehicle body attachments are designed to have a stiff joint between cradle assembly and vehicle body. The reinforcement spacers for front and rear cross members is made by sheet metal stampings instead of machined collared sleeves conventionally used. This yields a low cost and stiff joint with predictable load path. Additionally, since all the vehicle body attachments are such that they have fasteners oriented in vertical direction providing ease of assembly in series production line as well as assembly/disassembly during service.<br><br><br>
The stiff cradle assembly along with stiff attachment as explained in earlier paragraphs not only helps in better performance of suspension and engine mount but also helps to achieve improved torsional stability at the rear of vehicle body.<br>
Rear suspension and wheel assembly is mounted on engine cradle assembly by bolting the suspension arms at suspension inner pivot bracket (6) and suspension outer pivot bracket (7). Powertrain assembly comprising of engine, gearbox and exhaust system is mounted on engine cradle assembly by bolting the engine mounts at engine mount bracket (9) present on suspension cross member (2), powertrain mounting holes (22,23) on left side member (3) and powertrain mounting holes (30,31) on right side member (4) respectively. The engine mounts directly seat on the left side member (3) and right side member (4) thus eliminating extra brackets which are seen in conventional designs. Moreover this design lends greater stiffness in vertical direction for the engine mounting hardpoints resulting in effective isolation. Additionally, the powertrain assembly is easily mountable on engine cradle as it has to be dropped down on the engine cradle assembly and fastening the engine mount bolts. Cooling module radiator is mounted on radiator mounting bracket (8) fitted in rear cross member using bolting fasteners. The engine cradle assembly thus serves to support the powertrain and exhaust assembly, cooling module, rear suspension assembly etc to provide a completely modular structure thus facilitating ease of assembly in series production of high volumes as well as assembly/disassembly during service.<br>
One more advantage of the present invention is in ease of providing corrosion preventive coating without requiring drain holes which are present in conventional designs. The requirement of efficient corrosion preventive coating is that all interior and exterior surfaces of assembly are coated without creating any air pockets as well as paint accumulation. Usually drain and air holes are provided in prior art design to address this issue. In the present invention, the cradle assembly is dipped in the coating tank such that front crossmember is at the bottom and rear cross member is at top with both left and right side members<br><br><br>
being vertical. As the assembly is dipped into the tank the coating fluid enters the front cross member from the end sides enabling complete interior and exterior coating of the member, on further dipping the fluid enters into the side members (3,4) from openings (70,71) respectively, the air inside the side members (3,4) escapes from openings (72,73). And finally the fluid enters the rear cross tube from the end sides. When the cradle assembly is pulled upwards all the fluid remaining inside cradle tubular members follows reverse path and is drained out. This ensures complete interior and exterior coating of the all the elements of cradle assembly.<br>
It is further an object of the present invention to provide an engine cradle system with a plurality of attaching points to provide additional stiffness<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide attachment bracket design which caters to manufacturing induced dimensional variations It is further an object of the present invention to eliminate the requirement of drain holes for corrosion preventive coating on the cradle assembly<br><br></td>
