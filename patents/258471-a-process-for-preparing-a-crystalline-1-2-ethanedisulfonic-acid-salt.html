State of the Art<br>
Commonly-assigned U.S. Patent Application No. 10/779,157, filed on February 13, 2004, disclose novel biphenyl compounds that are useful as therapeutic agents for treating pulmonary disorders, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma. In particular, the compound, biphenyl-2-ylcarbamic acid l-[2-(2-chloro-4-{[(-R)-2-hydroxy-2-(8-hydroxy-2-oxo-l,2-dihydroquinolin-5-yl)ethylamino]methyl}-5-methoxyphenylcarbamoyl)ethyl]piperidin~4-yl ester is specifically disclosed in these applications as possessing both muscarinic antagonist and P2 adrenergic receptor agonist activity. The chemical structure of biphenyl-2-ylcarbamic acid l-[2-(2-chloro-4-{[(7?)-2-hydroxy-2-(8-hydroxy-2-oxo-l,2-dihydroquinolin-5-yl)ethylamino]methyl}-5-methoxyphenylcarbamoyI)ethyl]piperidin-4-yl ester is represented by formula I:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Therapeutic agents useful for treating pulmonary disorders are advantageously administered directly into the respiratory tract by inhalation. In this regard, several types of pharmaceutical inhalation devices have been developed for administering therapeutic agents by inhalation including dry powder inhalers (DPI), metered-dose inhalers (MDI) and nebulizer inhalers. When preparing pharmaceutical compositions and formulations for use in such devices, it is highly desirable to have a crystalline form of the therapeutic agent that is neither hygroscopic nor deliquescent and which has a relatively high melting point (i.e. greater than about 150°C) thereby allowing the material to be micronized without significant decomposition or loss of crystallinity.<br>
No crystalline salt forms of the compound of formula I have been reported previously. Accordingly, a need exists for a stable, non-deliquescent crystalline salt form of the compound of formula I which has an acceptable level of hygroscopicity and a relatively high melting point.<br>

1,2-EthanedisuIfonic Acid Salts of the Invention<br>
A crystalline 1,2-ethanedisulfonic acid salt of biphenyl-2-ylcarbamic acid l-[2-(2-chloro-4- {[(#)-2-hydroxy-2-(8-hydroxy-2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinolin-5-yl)ethylamino]methyl} -5-methoxyphenylcarbamoyl)ethyl]piperidin-4-yl ester of this invention can be prepared from biphenyl-2-ylcarbamic acid l-[2-(2-chloro-4-{[(J?)-2-hydroxy-2-(8-hydroxy-2-oxo-l,2-dihydroquinolin-5-yl)ethylami:no]methyl}-5-methoxyphenylcarbamoyl)ethyl]piperidin-4-yl ester and 1,2-ethanedisulfonic acid or a hydrate thereof.<br>
A 1,2-ethanedisuIfonic acid salt of this invention typically contains between about 0.90 and about 1.10 molar equivalents of 1,2-ethanedisulfonic acid per molar equivalent of the compound of formula I; including between about 0.95 and about 1.05 molar equivalents of 1,2-ethanedisulfonic acid per molar equivalent of the compound of formula 1. in a particular embodiment, the 1,2-ethanedisulfonic acid salt of this invention contains about 1 molar equivalent of 1,2-ethanedisulfonic acid per molar equivalent of the compound of formula I.<br>
The molar ratio of 1,2-ethanedisulfonic acid to biphenyl-2-ylcarbamic acid l-[2-(2-chloro-4-{[(^)-2-hydroxy-2-(8-hydi-oxy-2-oxo-l,2-dihydroquinolin-5-yl)ethylamino]methyl}-5-methoxyphenylcarbamoyl)ethyl]piperidin-4-yl ester can be readily determined by various methods available to those skilled in the art. For example, such molar ratios can be readily determined by 'H NMR. Alternatively, elemental analysis and HPLC methods can be used to determine the molar ratio.<br>
The biphenyl-2-ylcarbamic acid l-[2-(2-ch!oro-4-{[(/?)-2-hydroxy-2-(8-hydroxy-2-oxo-l,2-dihydroquinolin-5-yl)ethylamino]methyl}-5-methoxyphenylcarbamoyl)ethyl]-piperidin-4-yl ester employed in this invention can be readily prepared from commercially available starting materials and reagents using the procedures described in the Examples<br><br>
below; or using the procedures described in the commonly-assigned U.S. application described in the Background section of this application.<br>
1,2-Ethanedisiilfonic acid is commercially available from, for example, Alfa Chemicals Ltd., Berkshire, UK. In one embodiment, the 1,2-ethanedisulfonic acid employed in preparing the salts of this invention is a dihydrate. In a particular embodiment, the 1,2-ethanedisulfonic acid dihydrate has a purity greater than or equal to 97% (as determined by HPLC). If desired, the 1,2-disulfonic acid dihydrate employed in this invention can be recrystallized from, for example, acetic acid and acetic anhydride prior to use.<br>
To prepare a crystalline salt of this invention, the biphenyl-2-ylcarbamic acid l-[2-(2-chloro-4- {[(/?)-2-hydroxy-2-(8-hydroxy-2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinolin-5-yl)ethylamino]methyl}-5-methoxyphenylcarbamoyl)ethyl]piperidin-4-yl ester is typically contacted with about 0.75 to about 1.3 molar equivalents of 1,2-ethanedisulfonic acid or a hydrate thereof. Generally, this reaction is conducted in an inert diluent at a temperature ranging from about 0 °C to about 60 °C; including about 20 °C to about 55 °C, such as about 25 °C to about 50 °C. Suitable inert diluents for this reaction include, but are not limited to, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, isobutanol, ethyl acetate, dichloromethane and the like optionally containing water. In a particular embodiment, a solution of 1,2-ethanedisulfonic acid dihydrate in ethanol is added to about a five times larger volume of biphenyl-2-ylcarbamic acid l-[2-(2-chloro-4- {[(#)-2-hydroxy-2-(8-hydroxy-2-oxo-l ,2-dihydroquinolin-5-yl)ethylamino]methyl}-5-methoxyphenylcarbamoyl)ethyl]piperidin-4-yl ester in a mixture of isopropanol and dichloromethane (64:1). In other particular embodiments, the solution of 1,2-ethanedisulfonic acid dihydrate includes water or ethanol as the diluent and the biphenyl-2-ylcarbamic acid l-[2-(2-chloro-4-{[(^?)-2-hydroxy-2-(8-hydroxy-2-oxo-l,2-dihydroquinolin-5-yl)ethylamino]methyl}-5-methoxyphenylcarbamoyl)ethyl]piperidin-4-yl ester solution includes isopropanol or ethanol as the diluent.<br>
Alternatively, a crystalline 1,2-ethanedisulfonic acid salt of a compound of formula I can be prepared by contacting a silyl-protected derivative of the compound of formula I (i.e., a compound of formula II) with a source of fluoride ion and then, in the same reaction vessel, contacting the product with 1,2-ethanedisulfonic acid or a hydrate thereof, hi a particular embodiment, the silyl-protecting group is a tert-butyldimethylsilyl<br>
group. Other suitable silyl-protecting groups include tert-butyldiphenylsilyl,<br><br>
diphenylmethylsilyl, di-te7-/-buylmethylsilyl, /erf-butoxydiphenylsilyl and the like.

In a particular embodiment, the source of fluoride ion is triethylamine trihydrofluoride. Other suitable sources of fluoride ion include tetrabutylammoniuin fluoride, potassium fluoride with 18-crown-6, hydrogen fluoride, pyridine hydrofluoride, and the like.<br>
Generally, this process is conducted in an inert diluent at a temperature ranging from about 0 °C to about 50 °C; including about 20 °C to about 35 °C, such as about 25 °C to about 30 °C. Suitable inert diluents for this reaction include, but are not limited to, dichloromethane, methanol and mixtures thereof. In a particular embodiment, a solution of biphenyl-2-ylcarbamic acid l-[2-(4-{[(^)-2-(fer;-butyldimethylsilanyloxy)-2-(8-hydroxy-2-oxo~l,2-dihydroquinolin-5-yl)ethylamino]methyl}-2-chIoro-5-methoxy-phenylcarbamoyl)ethyl]piperidin-4-yl ester is contacted with about 2.5 to about 3.0 molar equivalents of triethylamine trihydrofluoride in dichloromethane at ambient temperature for about 12 to 24 hours or until removal of the silyl group is substantially complete. To the resulting solution, without isolation of the reaction product, is added about 0.9 to about 1.1 molar equivalents of 1,2-ethanedisulfonic acid dihydrate in methanol and this mixture is heated at about 25 °C to about 35 °C for about 2 to about 6 hours. Upon completion of the reaction, a crystalline 1,2-ethanedisulfonic acid salt of biphenyl-2-ylcarbamic acid l-[2-(2-chloro-4-{[(^)-2-hydroxy-2-(8-hydroxy-2-oxo-l,2-dihydroquinolin-5-yl)ethylamino]methyl}-5-methoxyphenylcarbamoyl)ethyl]piperidin-4-yl ester is isolated from the reaction mixture by any conventional means, such as precipitation, concentration, centrifugation and the like.<br>
Optionally, a crystalline 1,2-ethanedisulfonic acid salt of this invention can be further purified by stirring or slurring the salt in isopropanol containing about 15% to about 25%, including about 20%, water by volume. In a particular embodiment, about 10 mL of the isopropanol/water mixture is employed per gram of the 1,2-ethanedisulfonic acid salt.<br>
A process of preparing a crystalline 1,2-ethanedisulfonic acid salt of this invention can optionally include the use of a seed crystal to produce predominately a particular crystalline salt. For example, by using a seed crystal of a higher melting crystalline salt (i.e., greater than about 230 °C), a crystalline 1,2-ethanedisulfonic acid salt of a compound<br>
of formula I can be prepared having essentially the same melting point as the seed crystal.<br><br>
Such seed crystals can be used when initially forming the crystalline salt or they can be used to recrystallize a crystalline or partially crystalline salt.<br>
Typically, seed crystals are prepared at small scale by slow crystallization without stirring and without applying cooling. By way of illustration, to obtain seed crystals, the crystalline salt is typically dissolved in an inert diluent at a temperature sufficient to provide dissolution. Generally, in the initial process of obtaining seed crystals, a small quantity, typically less than 10 g, including less than 5 g, such as less than 1 g, of the crystalline salt is used, hi a particular embodiment, methanol containing about 12% to about 20% water, including about 13 % to about 15 % water, is used as the diluent at a temperature ranging from about 60 °C to about 70 °C, such as about 60 °C to about 65 °C. The solution is allowed to cool to room temperature. After about 1 day to about 3 days, the resulting crystals are isolated by filtration or other conventional means. Alternatively, seed crystals may be obtain from a previous preparation of crystalline material.<br>
In the recrystallization process using seed crystals, a crystalline 1,2-ethanedisulfonic acid salt of this invention is dissolved in an inert diluent as in the process of obtaining seed crystals, typically methanol containing 15% water, at a temperature ranging from about 60 °C to about 65 °C.   The solution is allowed to cool to a temperature at which the seed crystals do not dissolve, for example to a temperature in the range of from about 30 °C to about 40 °C, and then seed crystals are added. Typically, the ratio of the weight of seed crystals to the weight of crystalline salt in the solution is between about 1:5 and about 1:35. The solution is cooled to a temperature at which crystallization occurs, for example, to about 20 °C and stirred for about 2 hours to about 24 hours. The resulting crystals are isolated by conventional means. To obtain sufficient seed crystals to prepare large batches of material, the recrystallization process can be performed successively using the crystals obtained by a first recrystallization as the seed crystals for a subsequent recrystallization step. It will be appreciated that the specific temperatures at which the steps of the recrystallization process are performed are selected depending on the character of the diluent and the concentration of the crystalline salt in the diluent. Additionally, the recrystallization process can be conducted using either evaporation or an anti-solvent to facilitate crystallization instead of cooling.<br>
Among other advantages, it has been discovered that forming a crystalline 1,2-<br>
ethanedisulfonic acid salt of the compound of formula I is useful for purifying the<br><br>
compound of formula I. Generally, a crystalline 1,2-ethanedisuIfonic acid salt of this invention has a purity greater than 95%; and typically greater than 98%, as determined by high performance liquid chromatography.<br>
The crystalline 1,2-ethanedisulfonic acid salt of the present invention is characterized by a very high melting point as evidenced by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) traces which exhibit a peak in endothermic heat flow in the range of about 215 °C to about 240 °C. It has been observed that the melting point temperature of the crystalline salt is dependent on the process by which the crystalline salt was formed. The seed crystals formed by slow crystallization without stirring and without applied cooling exhibit melting points higher than about 230 °C. Crystalline salts formed by a process including recrystallization with such seed crystals typically exhibit melting points in the range of about 230 °C to about 245 °C, as shown, for example, in Figure 1. Crystalline salts formed without a seed crystal having a melting point above about 230 °C typically exhibit melting points in the range of about 215 °C to about 229 °C, as shown for example in Figure 2. hi particular embodiments, therefore, the invention provides crystalline 1,2-ethanedisulfonic acid salts of the compound of formula I having a DSC trace in the temperature range above about 200 °C that is substantially in accordance with the trace shown in Figure 1 or with that shown in Figure 2.<br>
In another embodiment, the crystalline 1,2-ethanedisulfonic acid salt of the present invention is characterized by a powder x-ray diffraction (PXRD) pattern having significant diffraction peaks at 20 values of 5.0 ±0.3, and 15.0±0.3. Subtle differences may be observed between the peak positions in the PXRD spectrum of a crystalline salt prepared by recrystallization from a high melting point seed crystal, as shown in Figure 3 and that of a salt prepared without use of such a seed crystal, as shown in Figure 4. Accordingly in separate embodiments, the crystalline 1,2-ethanedisulfonic acid salt of the compound of formula I is characterized by a powder x-ray diffraction pattern in which the peak positions are substantially in accordance with those shown in Figure 3 or with those shown in Figure 4.<br>
In another embodiment, the crystalline 1,2-ethanedisulfonic acid salt of the compound of formula I is characterized by its infrared (IR) absorption spectrum which shows significant absorption bands at about 704, 748, 768, 841, 900, 1055, 1104, 1166, 1218, 1294, 1408, 1522, 1609, 1655, and 1701 cm'1, as illustrated in Figure 5.<br><br>
A crystalline 1,2-ethanedisulfonic acid salt of the compound of formula I has been demonstrated to have a reversible sorption/desorption profile with an acceptable, moderate level of hygroscopicity (i.e., less than about 2.5 % weight gain in the humidity range of 40 % relative humidity to 75 % relative humidity).<br>
These properties of the salts of this invention are further illustrated in the Examples below.<br>
Pharmaceutical Compositions and Formulations<br>
The 1,2-ethanedisulfonic acid salt of the compound of formula I is typically administered to a patient in the form of a pharmaceutical composition or formulation. Such pharmaceutical compositions may be administered to the patient by any acceptable route of administration including, but not limited to, inhaled, oral, nasal, topical (including transdermal) and parenteral modes of administration. However, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that, once the crystalline salt of this invention has been formulated, it may no longer be in crystalline form, i.e., the salt maybe dissolved in a suitable carrier.<br>
Accordingly, in one of its compositions aspects, this invention is directed to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient and a 1,2-ethanedisulfonic acid salt of biphenyl-2-ylcarbamic acid l-[2-(2-chloro-4-{[(J?)-2-hydroxy-2-(8-hydroxy-2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinolin-5-yl)ethylamino]methyl} -5-methoxyphenylcarbamoyl)ethyl]piperidin-4-yl ester or a solvate thereof. Optionally, such pharmaceutical compositions may contain other therapeutic and/or formulating agents if desired.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention typically contain a therapeutically effective amount of a 1,2-ethanedisulfonic acid salt of biphenyl-2-ylcarbamic acid l-[2-(2-chloro-4-{[(^)-2-hydroxy-2-(8-hydroxy-2-oxo-l,2-dihydroquinolin-5^yl)ethylamino]methyl}-5-methoxyphenylcarbamoyI)ethyl]piperidin-4-yl ester or a solvate thereof. Typically, such pharmaceutical compositions will contain from about 0.01 to about 95% by weight of the active agent; including, from about 0.01 to about 30% by weight; such as from about 0.01 to about 10% by weight of the active agent.<br>
Any conventional carrier or excipient may be used in the pharmaceutical<br>
compositions of this invention. The choice of a particular carrier or excipient, or<br><br>
combinations of carriers or exipients, will depend on the mode of administration being used to treat a particular patient or type of medical condition or disease state. In this regard, the preparation of a suitable pharmaceutical composition for a particular mode of administration is well within the scope of those skilled in the pharmaceutical arts. Additionally, the ingredients for such compositions are commercially available from, for example, Sigma, P.O. Box 14508, St. Louis, MO 63178. By way of further illustration, conventional formulation techniques are described in Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 20th Edition, Lippincott Williams &amp; White, Baltimore, Maryland (2000); and H.C. Ansel et al., Pharmaceutical Dosage Fonns and Drug Delivery Systems, 7th Edition, Lippincott Williams &amp; White, Baltimore, Maryland (1999).<br>
Representative examples of materials which can serve as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include, but are not limited to, the following: (1) sugars, such as lactose, glucose and sucrose; (2) starches, such as corn starch and potato starch; (3) cellulose, and its derivatives, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose and cellulose acetate; (4) powdered tragacanth; (5) malt; (6) gelatin; (7) talc; (8) excipients, such as cocoa butter and suppository waxes; (9) oils, such as peanut oil, cottonseed oil, safflower oil, sesame oil, olive oil, corn oil and soybean oil; (10) glycols, such as propylene glyeol; (11) polyols, such as glycerin, sorbitol, mannitol and polyethylene glycol; (12) esters, such as ethyl oleate and ethyl laurate; (13) agar; (14) buffering agents, such as magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide; (15) alginic acid; (16) pyrogen-free water; (17) isotonic saline; (18) Ringer's solution; (19) ethyl alcohol; (20) phosphate buffer solutions; (21) compressed propellant gases, such as chlorofluorocarbons and hydrofluorocarbons; and (22) other non-toxic compatible substances employed in pharmaceutical compositions.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention are typically prepared by throughly and intimately mixing or blending a salt of the invention with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and one or more optional ingredients. If necessary or desired, the resulting uniformly blended mixture can then be shaped or loaded into tablets, capsules, pills, canisters, cartridges, dispensers and the like using conventional procedures and equipment.<br>
In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention are suitable for inhaled administration. Suitable pharmaceutical compositions for inhaled<br>
administration will typically be in the form of an aerosol or a powder. Such compositions<br><br>
are generally administered using well-known delivery devices, such as a nebulizer inhaler, a metered-dose inhaler (MDI), a dry powder inhaler (DPI) or a similar delivery device.<br>
hi a specific embodiment of this invention, the pharmaceutical composition comprising the active agent is administered by inhalation using a nebulizer inhaler. Such nebulizer devices typically produce a stream of high velocity air that causes the pharmaceutical composition comprising the active agent to spray as a mist that is carried into the patient's respiratory tract. Accordingly, when formulated for use in a nebulizer inhaler, the active agent is typically dissolved in a suitable carrier to form a solution. Suitable nebulizer devices are provided commercially, for example, by PARI GmbH (Starnberg, German). Other nebulizer devices include Respimat (Boehringer Ingelheim) and those disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 6,123,068 and WO 97/12687. A representative pharmaceutical composition for use in a nebulizer inhaler comprises an aqueous solution comprising from about 0.05 jj.g/mL to about 10 mg/niL of a 1,2-ethanedisulfonic acid salt of compound of formula I or a solvate thereof, hi one embodiment, the aqueous nebulizer formulation is isotonic. hi one embodiment, the aqueous nebulizer formulation has a pH in the range of from about 4 to about 6. In a particular embodiment, the aqueous nebulizer formulation is buffered with citrate buffer to a pH of about 5. In another particular embodiment, the aqueous nebulizer formulation contains from about 0.1 mg/mL to about 1.0 mg/mL free base equivalents of biphenyl-2-ylcarbamic acid l-[2-(2-chloro-4-{[(^)-2-hydroxy-2-(8-hydroxy-2-oxo-l,2-dihydroquinolin-5-yl)ethylamino]methyl}-5-methoxyphenylcarbamoyl)ethyl]piperidin-4-yl ester.<br>
In another specific embodiment of this invention, the pharmaceutical composition comprising the active agent is administered by inhalation using a dry powder inhaler. Such dry powder inhalers typically administer the active agent as a free-flowing powder that is dispersed in a patient's air-stream during inspiration, hi order to achieve a free flowing powder, the active agent is typically formulated with a suitable excipient such as lactose, starch, mannitol, dextrose, polylactic acid (PLA), polylactide-co-glycolide (PLGA) or combinations thereof. Typically, the active agent is micronized and combined with a suitable earner to form a blend of micronized particles of respirable size, where "micronized particles" or "micronized form" means at least about 90% of the particles have a diameter of less than about 10 urn.<br><br>
A representative pharmaceutical composition for use in a dry powder inhaler comprises lactose having a particle size between about 1 urn and about 100 urn and micronized particles of a 1,2-ethanedisulfonic acid salt of compound of formula I, or a solvate thereof.<br>
Such a dry powder formulation can be made, for example, by combining the lactose with the active agent and then dry blending the components. Alternatively, if desired, the active agent can be formulated without an excipient. The pharmaceutical composition is then typically loaded into a dry powder dispenser, or into inhalation cartridges or capsules for use with a dry powder delivery device.<br>
Examples of dry powder inhaler delivery devices include Diskhaler (GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, NC) (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,035,237); Diskus (GlaxoSmithKline) (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 6,378,519; Turbuhaler (AstraZeneca, Wilmington, DE) (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 4,524,769); Rotahaler (GlaxoSmithKline) (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 4,353,365) and Handihaler (Boeliringer fngelheim). Further examples of suitable DPI devices are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,415,162, 5,239,993, and 5,715,810 and references cited therein.<br>
In yet another specific embodiment of this invention, the pharmaceutical composition comprising the active agent is administered by inhalation using a metered-dose inhaler. Such rnetered-dose inhalers typically discharge a measured amount of the active agent or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof using compressed propellant gas. Accordingly, pharmaceutical compositions administered using a metered-dose inhaler typically comprise a solution or suspension of the active agent in a liquefied propellant. Any suitable liquefied propellant may be employed including chlorofluorocarbons, such as CC^F, and hydrofluoroalkanes (HFAs), such as 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (HFA 134a) and 1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoro-n-propane, (HFA 227). Due to concerns about chlorofluorocarbons affecting the ozone layer, formulations containing FTFAs are generally preferred. Additional optional components of HFA formulations include co-solvents, such as ethanol or pentane, and surfactants, such as sorbitan trioleate, oleic acid, lecithin, and glycerin. See, for example, U.S. Patent No. 5,225,183, EP 0717987 A2, and WO 92/22286.<br>
A representative pharmaceutical composition for use in a metered-dose inhaler comprises from about 0.01 % to about 5 % by weight of a 1,2-ethanedisulfonic acid salt<br>
of compound of formula I, or a solvate thereof; from about 0 % to about 20 % by weight<br><br>
ethanol; and from about 0 % to about 5 % by weight surfactant; with the remainder being an HFA propellant.<br>
Such compositions are typically prepared by adding chilled or pressurized hydrofluoroalkane to a suitable container containing the active agent, ethanol (if present) and the surfactant (if present). To prepare a suspension, the active agent is micronized and then combined with the propellant. The formulation is then loaded into an aerosol canister, which forms a portion of a metered-dose inhaler device. Examples of metered-dose inhaler devices developed specifically for use with HFA propellants are provided in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,006,745 and 6,143,277. Alternatively, a suspension formulation can be prepared by spray drying a coating of surfactant on micronized particles of the active agent. See, for example, WO 99/53901 and WO 00/61108.<br>
For additional examples of processes of preparing respirable particles, and formulations and devices suitable for inhalation dosing see U.S. Patent Nos. 6,268,533, 5,983,956, 5,874,063, and 6,221,398, and WO 99/55319 and WO 00/30614.<br>
In another embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention are suitable for oral administration. Suitable pharmaceutical compositions for oral administration may be in the form of capsules, tablets, pills, lozenges, cachets, dragees, powders, granules; or as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water or water-in-oil liquid emulsion; or as an elixir or syrup; and the like; each containing a predetermined amount of a salt of the present invention as an active ingredient.<br>
When intended for oral administration in a solid dosage form (i.e., as capsules, tablets, pills and the like), the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention will typically comprise a salt of the present invention as the active ingredient and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, such as sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate. Optionally or alternatively, such solid dosage forms may also comprise: (1) fillers or extenders, such as starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, and/or silicic acid; (2) binders, such as carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, sucrose and/or acacia; (3) humectants, such as glycerol; (4) disintegrating agents, such as agar-agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain silicates, and/or sodium carbonate; (5) solution retarding agents, such as paraffin; (6) absorption accelerators, such as quaternary ammonium compounds; (7) wetting agents, such as cetyl alcohol and/or glycerol monostearate; (8) absorbents, such as kaolin and/or bentonite clay;<br><br>
(9) lubricants, such as talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate, and/or mixtures thereof; (10) coloring agents; and (11) buffering agents.<br>

If desired, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may also be formulated to provide slow or controlled release of the active ingredient using, by way of example, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose in varying proportions; or other polymer matrices, such has polylactic acid (PLA) or polylactide-co-glycolide (PLGA), liposomes and/or microspheres.<br>
In addition, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may optionally contain opacifying agents and may be formulated so that they release the active ingredient only, or preferentially, in a certain portion of the gastrointestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions which can be used include polymeric substances and waxes. The active ingredient can also be in micro-encapsulated form, if appropriate, with one or more of the above-described excipients.<br>
Suitable liquid dosage forms for oral administration include, by way of illustration, pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. Such liquid dosage forms typically comprise the active ingredient and an inert diluent, such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing<br>
agents and emulsifiers, such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl<br><br>
acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, oils (esp., cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof. Suspensions, in addition to the active ingredient, may contain suspending agents such as, for example, ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitol and sorbitan esters, microcrystalline cellulose, aluminum metahydroxide, bentonite, agar-agar and tragacanth, and mixtures thereof.<br>
When intended for oral administration, the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention are preferably packaged in a unit dosage form. For example, such unit dosage forms may be capsules, tablets, pills, and the like.<br>
The salts of this invention can also be administered transdermally using known transdermal delivery systems and excipents. For example, a compound of this invention can be admixed with permeation enhancers, such as propylene glycol, polyethylene glycolm monolaurate, azacycloalkan-2-ones and the like, and incorporated into a patch or similar delivery system. Additional excipients including gelling agents, emulsifiers and buffers, may be used in such transdermal compositions if desired.<br>
rrhe pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may also contain other therapeutic agents that are co-administered with a 1,2-ethanedisulfonic acid salt of compound of fonnula I or solvate thereof. For example, the pharmacuetical compositions of this invention may further comprise one or more therapeutic agents selected from anti-inflammatory agents (e.g. steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, such as corticosteroids; and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs), phosphodiesterase IV inhibitors, antiinfective agents (e.g. antibiotics or antivirals), antihistamines, fa adrenergic receptor agonists, muscarinic receptor antagonistst (i.e., antichlolinergic agents) and the like. The other therapeutic agents can be used in the form of pharmaceutically acceptable salts or solvates. Additionally, if appropriate, the other therapeutic agents can be used as optically pure stereoisoniers.<br>
If desired, the salts of this invention can also be administered in combination with another therapeutic agent or agents, such those described herein. In this embodiment, the components are not physically mixed together but are administered simultaneously or sequentially as separate compositions. For example, a salt of this invention can be administered by inhalation simultaneously or sequentially with a steroidal anti-inflammatory agent, such as a corticosteroid, using an inhalation delivery device that<br><br>

A dynamic moisture sorption (DMS) assessment (also known as a moisture sorption-desorption profile) was performed for a hand ground sample of a crystalline 1,2-ethanedisulfonic acid salt of biphenyl-2-ylcarbamic acid l-[2-(2-chloro-4-{[(/?)-2-hydroxy-2-(8-hydroxy-2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinolin-5-yl)ethylamino]methyl} -5-methoxyphenylcarbamoyl)ethyl]piperidin-4-yl ester of Preparation 18 using a VTI atmospheric microbalance, SGA-100 system (VTI Corp., Hialeah, FL 33016). A sample size of approximately 10 mg was used and the humidity was set at the ambient value at the start of the analysis. A typical DMS analysis consisted of three scans: ambient to 2% relative humidity (RH), 2% RH to 90% RH, 90% RH to 5% RH at a scan rate of 5 % RH/step. The mass was measured every two minutes and the RH was changed to the next value (+/- 5 %RH) when the mass of the sample was stable to within 0.01 % for 5 consecutive points. A representative DMS trace is shown in Figure 6.<br>
The DMS trace demonstrates that a 1,2-ethanedisulfonic acid salt of the present invention has a reversible sorption/desorption profile with moderate (

The following elemental percentages of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and sulfur of a sample of a crystalline 1,2-ethanedisulfonic acid salt of biphenyl-2-ylcarbamic acid 1-[2-(2-chloro-4-{[(^)-2-hydroxy-2-(8-hydroxy-2-oxo-l,2-dihydroquinolin-5-yl)ethylamino]methyl} -5-methoxyphenylcarbamoyl)ethyl]piperidin-4-yl ester of Example 6 were determined by combustion analysis using a Flash EA 1112 Elemental Analyzer (CE Elantech, Lakewood, NJ): carbon 52.95 %, hydrogen 5.43 %, nitrogen 6.83 %, and sulfur 6.87 %. The weight percentage of 1,2-ethanedisulfonic acid in the crystalline sample, calculated from the measured weight percentage of sulfur, is 20.4 %,<br><br>
which is equal to the theoretical weight percentage of 20.4 %, providing a counterion ratio of 1:1.<br>

Adrenergic Receptors<br>
Chinese hamster ovarian (CHO) cell lines stably expressing cloned human (3i, $2 or PS adrenergic receptors, respectively, were grown to near confluency in Hams F-12 media with 10% FBS in the presence of 500 u.g/mL Geneticin. The cell monolayer was lifted with 2mM EDTA in PBS. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 1,000 rpm, and cell pellets were either stored frozen at -80 °C or membranes were prepared immediately for use. For preparation of Pi and $2 receptor expressing membranes, cell pellets were re-suspended in lysis buffer (10 mM HEPES/HC1, lOmM EDTA, pH 7.4 at 4°C) and homogenized using a tight-fitting Dounce glass homogenizer (30 strokes) on ice. For the more protease-sensitive p3 receptor expressing membranes, cell pellets were homogenated in lysis buffer (lOmM Tris/HCl, pH 7.4) supplemented with one tablet of "Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Tablets with 2 mM EDTA" per 50 mL buffer (Roche Catalog No. 1697498, Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN). The homogenate was cenlrifuged at 20,000 x g, and the resulting pellet was washed once with lysis buffer by re-suspension and centrifugation as above. The final pellet was then re-suspended in ice-cold binding assay buffer (75 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.4, 12.5mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA). The protein concentration of the membrane suspension was determined by the methods described in Lowry et al., 1951, Journal of Biological Chemistry, 193, 265; and Bradford, Analytical Biochemistry, 1976, 72, 248-54. All membranes were stored frozen in aliquots at -80 °C or used immediately.<br>

CHO cell lines stably expressing cloned human hMj, hMa, hMb and hM4 muscarinic receptor subtypes, respectively, were grown to near confluency in HAM's F-12 media supplemented with 10% FBS and 250 ug/mL Geneticin. The cells were grown<br><br>
in a 5% CO2, 37 °C incubator and lifted with 2 mM EDTA in dPBS. Cells were collected by 5 minute centrifugation at 650 x g, and cell pellets were either stored frozen at -80 °C or membranes were prepared immediately for use. For membrane preparation, cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer and homogenized with a Polytron PT-2100 tissue disrupter (Kinematica AG; 20 seconds x 2 bursts). Crude membranes were centrifuged at 40,000 x g for 15 minutes at 4°C. The membrane pellet was then resuspended with re-suspension buffer and homogenized again with the Polytron tissue disrupter. The protein concentration of the membrane suspension was determined by the method described in Lowry et al., 1951, Journal of Biochemistry, 193, 265. All membranes were stored frozen in aliquots at -80 °C or used immediately. Aliquots of prepared hMs receptor membranes were purchased directly from Perkin Elmer and stored at -80 °C until use.<br>
Assay Test Procedure A<br>
Radioligand Binding Assay for Human Pi, p2 and Pa Adrenergic Receptors<br>
Binding assays were performed in 96-well microtiter plates in a total assay volume of 100 |u.L with 10-15 ug of membrane protein containing the human Pi, $2 or p3 adrenergic receptors in assay buffer (75 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.4 at 25°C, 12.5 mM MgCI2, 1 mM EDTA, 0.2% BSA). Saturation binding studies for determination of K^ values of the radio ligand were done using [3H]-dihydroalprenolol (NET-720, 100 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences Inc., Boston, MA) for the Pi and Pa receptors and [125I]-(-)-iodocyanopindolol (NEX-189, 220 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences Inc., Boston, MA) at 10 or 11 different concentrations ranging from 0.01 nM to 20 nM. Displacement assays for determination of K, values of test compounds were done with [3H]-dihydroalprenolol at 1 nM and [l25I]-(-)-iodocyanopindolol at 0.5 nM for 10 or 11 different concentrations of test compound ranging from 10 pM to 10 pM. Non-specific binding was determined in the presence of 10 pM propranolol. Assays were incubated for 1 hour at 37°C, and then binding reactions were terminated by rapid filtration over GF/B for the pi and Pa receptors or GF/C glass fiber filter plates for the PS receptors (Packard BioScience Co., Meriden, CT) presoaked in 0.3% polyethyleneimine. Filter plates were washed three times with filtration buffer (75 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.4 at 4°C, 12.5 mM MgCla, 1 mM EDTA) to remove unbound radioactivity. The plates were then dried and 50 uL of Microscint-20 liquid scintillation fluid (Packard BioScience Co., Meriden, CT)<br><br>
was added and plates were counted in a Packard Topcount liquid scintillation counter (Packard BioScience Co., Meriden, CT). Binding data were analyzed by nonlinear regression analysis with the GraphPad Prism Software package (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) using the 3-parameter model for one-site competition. The curve minimum was fixed to the value for nonspecific binding, as determined in the presence of 10 (J.M propranolol. K, values for test compounds were calculated from observed ICso values and the K^ value of the radioligand using the Cheng-Prusoff equation (Cheng Y, and Prusoff WH., Biochemical Pharmacology, 1973, 22, 23, 3099-108).<br>
In this assay, a lower K, value indicates that a test compound has a higher binding affinity for the receptor tested. When tested in this assay, the compound of formula I was found to have a Kj value of less than 10 nM for the human 02 adrenergic receptor.<br>
Assay Test Procedure B<br>
Radioligand Binding Assay for Muscarinic Receptors<br>
Radioligand binding assays for cloned human muscarinic receptors were performed in 96-well microtiter plates in a total assay volume of 100 uL. CHO cell membranes stably expressing either the hMj, hM2, hMs, hM4 or hMs muscarinic subtype were diluted in assay buffer to the following specific target protein concentrations (tig/well): 10 tig for hMi, 10-15 ug for hM2, 10-20 |.ig for hM3, 10-20 ug for hM4, and 10-12 fig for hMs to get similar signals (cpm). The membranes were briefly homogenized using a Polytron tissue disruptor (10 seconds) prior to assay plate addition. Saturation binding studies for determining KD values of the radioligand were performed using L-[7V-methyl-3//]scopolamine methyl chloride ([3H]-NMS) (TRK666, 84.0 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, England) at concentrations ranging from 0.001 nM to 20 nM. Displacement assays for determination of K,- values of test compounds were performed with [3H]-NMS at 1 nM and eleven different test compound concentrations. The test compounds were initially dissolved to a concentration of 400 uM in dilution buffer and then serially diluted 5x with dilution buffer to final concentrations ranging from 10 pM to 100 uM. The addition order and volumes to the assay plates were as follows: 25 uL radioligand, 25 uL diluted test compound, and 50 uL membranes. Assay plates were incubated for 60 minutes at 37°C. Binding reactions were terminated by rapid filtration over GF/B glass fiber filter plates (PerkinEhner Inc., Wellesley, MA)<br><br>
pre-treated in 1% BSA. Filter plates were rinsed three times with wash buffer (10 mM HEPES) to remove unbound radioactivity. The plates were then air dried and 50 uL Microscint-20 liquid scintillation fluid (PerkinElrner Inc., Wellesley, MA) was added to each well. The plates were then counted in a PerkinElmer Topcount liquid scintillation counter (PerkinElmer Inc., Wellesley, MA). Binding data were analyzed by nonlinear regression analysis with the GraphPad Prism Software package (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) using the one-site competition model. Kr- values for test compounds were calculated from observed ICso values and the KD value of the radioligand using the Cheng-Prusoff equation (Cheng Y; Prusoff WH. (1973) Biochemical Pharmacology, 22(23):3099-108). Kj values were converted to pK; values to determine the geometric mean and 95% confidence intervals. These summary statistics were then converted back to K; values for data reporting.<br>
In this assay, a lower K, value indicates that the test compound has a higher binding affinity for the receptor tested. When tested in this assay, the compound of formula 1 was found to have a Kj value of less than 10 nM for the human M2 and MS muscarinic receptors.<br>
Assay Test Procedure C<br>
Whole-cell cAMP Flashplate Assay in CHO Cell Lines Heterologously Expressing<br>
Human PI, p2 or Pa Adrenergic Receptors<br>
cAMP assays were performed in a radioimmunoassay format using the Flashplate Adenylyl Cyclase Activation Assay System with [ 125I]-cAMP (NEN SMP004, PerkinElmer Life Sciences Inc., Boston, MA), according to the manufacturers instructions. For the determination of P receptor agonist potency (ECso), CHO-K1 cell lines stably expressing cloned human Pi, fa or PS adrenergic receptors were grown to near confluency in RAM's F-12 media supplemented with 10% FBS and Geneticin (250 ug/mL). Cells were rinsed with PBS and detached in dPBS (Dulbecco's Phosphate Buffered Saline, without CaCl2and MgCl2) containing 2 mM EDTA or Trypsin-EDTA solution (0.05% trypsin/0.53 mM EDTA). After counting cells in Coulter cell counter, cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 1,000 rpm and re-suspended in stimulation buffer containing IBMX (PerkinElmer Kit) pre-warmed to room temperature to a concentration of 1.6 x 106 to 2.8 x 106 cells/mL. About 60,000 to 80,000 cells per well were used in<br><br>
this assay. Test compounds (10 mM in DMSO) were diluted into PBS containing 0.1% BSA in Beckman Biomck-2000 and tested at 11 different concentrations ranging from 100 uM to 1 pM. Reactions were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C and stopped by adding 100 u.L of cold detection buffer containing [125I]-cAMP (NEN SMP004, PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA). The amount of cAMP produced (pmol/well) was calculated based on the counts observed for the samples and cAMP standards as described in the manufacturer's user manual. Data were analyzed by nonlinear regression analysis with the GraphPad Prism Software package (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) with the sigmoidal equation. The Cheng-Prusoff equation (Cheng Y, and Prusoff WH., Biochemical Pharmacology, 1973, 22, 23, 3099-108) was used to calculate the EC50 values.<br>
In this assay, a lower ECso value indicates that the test compound has a higher functional activity at the receptor tested. When tested in this assay, the compound of formula I was found to have an EC 50 value of less than 10 nM for the human (32 adrenergic receptor.<br>
Assay Test Procedure D<br>
Functional Assays of Antagonism for Muscarinic Receptor Subtypes<br>
A.        Blockade of Agonist-Mediated [3sS]GTPyS Binding<br>
The functional potency of a test compound was determined by measuring the ability of the compound to block oxotremorine-stimulated [35S]GTPyS binding in CHO-tCl cells expressing the hJMb receptor.<br>
At the time of use, frozen membranes were thawed and then diluted in assay buffer with a final target tissue concentration of 5-10 u,g protein per well. The membranes were briefly homogenized using a Polytron PT-2100 tissue disrupter and then added to the assay plates.<br>
The ECgo value (effective concentration for 90% maximal response) for stimulation of [35S]GTPyS binding by the agonist oxotremorine was determined in each experiment.<br>
To determine the ability of a test compound to inhibit oxotremorine-stimulated [35S]GTPyS binding, the following was added to each well of 96 well plates: 25 uL of assay buffer with [35S]GTPyS (0.4nM), 25 joL of oxotremorine(EC90) and GDP (3uM),<br><br>
25 uL of diluted test compound and 25 uL CHO cell membranes expressing the receptor. The assay plates were then incubated at 37 °C for 60 minutes. The assay plates were filtered over 1 % BSA-pretreated GF/B filters using a PerkinElmer 96-well harvester. The plates were rinsed with ice-cold wash buffer for 3 x 3 seconds and then air or vacuum dried. Microscint-20 scintillation liquid (50 pL) was added to each well, and each plate was sealed and radioactivity counted on a Topcounter (PerkinElmer). Data were analyzed by nonlinear regression analysis with the GraphPad Prism Software package (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) using the non-linear regression, one-site competition equation. The Cheng-Prusoff equation was used to calculate the Kj, using the IC50 values of the concentration-response curve for the test compound and the oxotremorine concentration in the assay as the KD and [L], ligand concentration, respectively.<br>
In this assay, a lower Kj value indicates that the test compound has a higher functional activity at the receptor tested. When tested in this assay, the compound of formula I was found to have a IQ value of less than about 10 nM for blockade of oxotremorine-stimulated [35S]GTPyS binding in CHO-K1 cells expressing the hM2 receptor.<br><br>
B.        Blockade of Agonist-Mediated Calcium Release via FLIPR Assays<br>
Muscarinic receptor subtypes (Mi, MB and M$ receptors), which couple to Gq proteins, activate the phospholipase C (PLC) pathway upon agonist binding to the receptor. As a result, activated PLC hydrolyzes phosphatyl inositol diphosphate (PIPi) to diacylglycerol (DAG) and phosphatidyl-l,4,5-triphosphate (IPs), which in turn generates calcium release from intracellular stores, i.e., endoplasmic and sarcoplasmic reticulum. The FLIPR (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) assay capitalizes on this increase in intracellular calcium by using a calcium sensitive dye (Fluo-4AM5 Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) that fluoresces when free calcium binds. This fluorescence event is measured in real time by the FLIPR, which detects the change in fluorescence from a monolayer of cells cloned with human MI and M3, and chimpanzee MS receptors. Antagonist potency can be determined by the ability of antagonists to inhibit agonist-mediated increases in intracellular calcium.<br>
3<br>
For FLIPR calcium stimulation assays, CHO cells stably expressing the hMj, hM and cMs receptors were seeded into 96-well FLIPR plates the night before the assay was done. Seeded cells were washed twice by Cellwash (MTX Labsystems, Inc.) with FLIPR<br><br>
buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mM calcium chloride, 2.5 mM probenecid in Hank's Buffered Salt Solution (HBSS) without calcium and magnesium) to remove growth media and leaving 50 pL/well of FLIPR buffer. The cells were then incubated with 50 uL/well of 4 (.iM FLUO-4AM (a 2X solution was made) for 40 minutes at 37 °C, 5% carbon dioxide. Following the dye incubation period, cells were washed two times with FLIPR buffer, leaving a final volume of 50 (iL/well.<br>
To determine antagonist potency, the dose-dependent stimulation of intracellular Ca2+ release for oxotremorine was first determined so that antagonist potency can later be measured against oxotremorine stimulation at an ECgo concentration. Cells were first incubated with compound dilution buffer for 20 minutes, followed by agonist addition, which was performed by the FLIPR. An ECgo value for oxotremorine was generated according to the method detailed in the FLIPR measurement and data reduction section below, in conjunction with the formula ECp - ((F/100-F)A1/H) * EC50. An oxotremorine concentration of 3 x ECp was prepared in stimulation plates such that an ECgo concentration of oxotremorine was added to each well in the antagonist inhibition assay plates.<br>
The parameters used for the FLIPR were: exposure length of 0.4 seconds, laser strength of 0.5 watts, excitation wavelength of 488 nm, and emission wavelength of 550 nm. Baseline was determined by measuring the change in fluorescence for 10 seconds prior to addition of agonist. Following agonist stimulation, the FLIPR continuously measured the change of fluorescence every 0.5 to 1 second for 1.5 minutes to capture the maximum fluorescence change.<br>
The change of fluorescence was expressed as maximum fluorescence minus baseline fluorescence for each well. The raw data was analyzed against the logarithm of drug concentration by nonlinear regression with GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) using the built-in model for sigmoidal dose-response. Antagonist K; values were determined by Prism using the oxotremorine ECso value as the KO and the oxotremorine £€90 for the ligand concentration according to the Cheng-Prusoff equation (Cheng &amp; Prusoff, 1973).<br>
In this assay, a lower Kj value indicates that the test compound has a higher functional activity at the receptor tested. When tested in this assay, the compound of<br><br>
formula I was found to have a K; value of less than about 10 nM for blockade of agonist-mediated calcium release in CHO cells stably expressing the hMi, hMa and cMs receptors.<br>

Whole-cell cAMP Flashplate Assay With a Lung Epithelial Cell Line Endogenously<br>
Expressing Human p2 Adrenergic Receptor<br>
For the determination of agonist potencies and efficacies (intrinsic activities) in a cell line expressing endogenous levels of the Pa adrenergic receptor, a human lung epithelial cell line (BEAS-2B) was used (ATCC CRL-9609, American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) (January B, et al., British Journal of Pharmacology, 1998, 123, 4, 701-11). Cells were grown to 75-90% confluency in complete, serum-free medium (LHC-9 MEDIUM containing Epinephrine and Retinoic Acid, cat # 181-500, Biosource International, Camarillo, CA). The day before the assay, medium was switched to LHC-8 (no epinephrine or retinoic acid, cat # 141-500, Biosource International, Camarillo, CA).<br>
cAMP assays were performed in a radioimmunoassay format using the Flashplate Adenylyl Cyclase Activation Assay System with [125I]-cAMP (NEN SMP004, PerkinElmer Life Sciences Inc., Boston, MA), according to the manufacturers instructions.<br>
On the day of the assay, cells were rinsed with PBS, lifted by scraping with 5mM EDTA in PBS, and counted. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 1,000 rpm and re-suspended in stimulation buffer pre-warmed to 37 °C at a final concentration of 600,000 cells/rnL. Cells were used at a final concentration of 100,000 to 120,000 cells/well in this assay. Test compounds were serially diluted into assay buffer (75 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.4 at 25°C, 12.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 0.2% BSA) in Beckman Biomek-2000. Test compounds were tested in the assay at 11 different concentrations, ranging from 10 |jM to 10 pM. Reactions were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C and stopped by addition of 100 |o,L of ice-cold detection buffer. Plates were sealed, incubated over night at 4 °C and counted the next morning in a Topcount scintillation counter (Packard BioScience Co., Meriden, CT). The amount of cAMP produced per mL of reaction was calculated based on the counts observed for samples and cAMP standards, as described in the manufacturer's user manual. Data were analyzed by nonlinear regression analysis with the GraphPad Prism<br><br>
Software package (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) using the 4-parameter model for sigmoidal dose-response.<br>
In this assay, a lower ECso value indicates that the test compound has a higher functional activity at the receptor tested. When tested in this assay, the compound of formula I was found to have an EC5o value of less than about 10 nM for the p2 adrenergic receptor.<br>
Assay Test Procedure F<br>
Duration of Bronchoprotection In Guinea Pig Models of Acetylcholine-Induced or<br>
Histamine-Induced Bronchoconstriction<br>
These in vivo assays were used to assess the bronchoprotective effects of test compounds exhibiting both muscarinic receptor antagonist and p2 adrenergic receptor agonist activity. To isolate muscarinic antagonist activity in the acetylcholine-induced bronchoconstriction model, the animals were administered propanolol, a compound that blocks p receptor activity, prior to the administration of acetylcholine. Duration of bronchoprotection in the histamine-induced bronchoconstriction model reflects fa adrenergic receptor agonist activity.<br>
Groups of 6 male guinea pigs (Duncan-Hartley (HsdPocrDH) Harlan, Madison, WI) weighing between 250 and 350 g were individually identified by cage cards. Throughout the study, animals were allowed access to food and water ad libitum.<br>
Test compounds were administered via inhalation over 10 minutes in a whole-body exposure dosing chamber (R&amp;S Molds, San Carlos, CA). The dosing chambers were arranged so that an aerosol was simultaneously delivered to 6 individual chambers from a central manifold. Guinea pigs were exposed to an aerosol of a test compound or vehicle (WFI). These aerosols were generated from aqueous solutions using an LC Star Nebulizer Set (Model 22F51, PARI Respiratory Equipment, Inc. Midlothian, VA) driven by a mixture of gases (CO2 = 5%, O2 = 21% and N2 = 74%) at a pressure of 22 psi. The gas flow through the nebulizer at this operating pressure was approximately 3 LI minute. The generated aerosols were driven into the chambers by positive pressure. No dilution air was used during the delivery of aerosolized solutions. During the 10 minute nebulization, approximately 1.8 mL of solution was nebulized. This value was measured gravimetrically by comparing pre-and post-nebulization weights<br>
of the filled nebulizer.<br><br>
The bronchoprotective effects of test compounds administered via inhalation were evaluated using whole body plethysmography at 1.5, 24, 48 and 72 hours post-dose.<br>
Forty-five minutes prior to the start of the pulmonary evaluation, each guinea pig was anesthetized with an intramuscular injection of ketamine (43.75 mg/kg), xylazine (3.50 mg/kg) and acepromazine (1.05 mg/kg). After the surgical site was shaved and cleaned with 70% alcohol, a 2-3 cm midline incision of the ventral aspect of the neck was made. Then, the jugular vein was isolated and cannulated with a saline-filled polyethylene catheter (PE-50, Becton Dickinson, Sparks, MD) to allow for intravenous infusions of acetylcholine (Ach) or histamine in saline. The trachea was then dissected free and cannulated with a 14G teflon tube (#NE- 014, Small Parts, Miami Lakes, FL). If required, anesthesia was maintained by additional intramuscular injections of the aforementioned anesthetic mixture. The depth of anesthesia was monitored and adjusted if the animal responds to pinching of its paw or if the respiration rate was greater than 100 breaths/minute.<br>
Once the cannulations were completed, the animal was placed into a plethysmograph (#PLY3114, Buxco Electronics, Inc., Sharon, CT) and an esophageal pressure cannula (PK-160, Becton Dickinson, Sparks, MD) was inserted to measure pulmonary driving pressure (pressure). 1'he teflon tracheal tube was attached to the opening of the plethysmograph to allow the guinea pig to breathe room air from outside the chamber. The chamber was then sealed. A heating lamp was used to maintain body temperature and the guinea pig's lungs were inflated 3 times with 4 mL of air using a 10 mL calibration syringe (#5520 Series, Hans Rudolph, Kansas City, MO) to ensure that the lower airways did not collapse and that the animal did not suffer from hyperventilation.<br>
Once it was determined that baseline values were within the range of 0.3 - 0.9 mL/cm H^O for compliance and within the range of 0.1 - 0.199 cm H^O/mL per second for resistance, the pulmonary evaluation was initiated. A Buxco pulmonary measurement computer progam enabled the collection and derivation of pulmonary values.<br>
Starting this program initiated the experimental protocol and data collection. The changes in volume over lime that occur within the plethysmograph with each breath were measured via a Buxco pressure transducer. By integrating this signal over time, a measurement of flow was calculated for each breath. This signal, together with the<br><br>
pulmonary driving pressure changes, which were collected using a Sensym pressure transducer (#TRD4100), was connected via a Buxco (MAX 2270) preamplifier to a data collection interface (#'s SFT3400 and SFT3813). All other pulmonary parameters were derived from these two inputs.<br>
Baseline values were collected for 5 minutes, after which time the guinea pigs were challenged with Ach or histamine. When evaluating the muscarinic antagonist effects, propanolol (5 mg/Kg, iv) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was administered 15 minutes prior to challenge with Ach. Ach (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) (0.1 mg/mL) was infused intravenously for 1 minute from a syringe pump (sp210iw, World Precision Instruments, Inc., Sarasota, FL) at the following doses and prescribed times from the start of the experiment: 1.9 ug/minute at 5 minutes, 3.8 ug/minute at 10 minutes, 7.5 ug/minute at 15 minutes, 15.0 ug/minute at 20 minutes, 30 ug/minute at 25 minutes and 60 ug/minute at 30 minutes. Alternatively, bronchoprotection of test compounds was assessed in the acetylcholine challenge model without pretreatment with a beta blocking compound.<br>
When evaluating the (52 adrenergic receptor agonist effects of test compounds, histamine (25 ug/mL) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was infused intravenously for 1 minute from a syringe pump at the following doses and prescribed times from the start of the experiment: 0.5 ug/minute at 5 minutes, 0.9 ug/minute at 10 minutes, 1.9 ug/minute at 15 minutes, 3.8 jig/minute at 20 minutes, 7.5 ug/minute at 25 minutes and 15 ug/minute at 30 minutes. If resistance or compliance had not returned to baseline values at 3 minutes following each Ach or histamine dose, the guinea pig's lungs were inflated 3 times with 4 ml, of air from a 10 mL calibration syringe. Recorded pulmonary parameters include respiration frequency (breaths/minute), compliance (mL/cm HjO) and pulmonary resistance (cm H2O/ mL per second). Once the pulmonary function measurements were completed at minute 35 of this protocol, the guinea pig was removed from the plethysmograph and euthanized by carbon dioxide asphyxiation. The dataware evaluated in one of two ways:<br>
(a)       Pulmonary resistance (RL, cm HiO/mL per second) was calculated from the ratio of "change in pressure" to "the change in flow." The RL response to ACh (60 ug/min, IH) was computed for the vehicle and the test compound groups. The mean ACh response in vehicle-treated animals, at each pre-treatment time, was calculated and used<br>
to compute % inhibition of ACh response, at the corresponding pre-treatment time, at<br><br>
each test compound dose. Inhibition dose-response curves for 'Rj,' were fitted with a four parameter logistic equation using GraphPad Prism, version 3.00 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, California) to estimate bronchoprotective DDso (dose required to inhibit the ACh (60 (ig/min) bronchocontrictor response by 50%). The equation used was as follows:<br>
Y = Min + (Max-Min)/(l + 10 ((log ro5°-X)* Hillslope) )<br>
where X is the logarithm of dose, Y is the response (% Inhibition of ACh induced increase in RL). Y starts at Min and approaches asymptotically to Max with a sigmoidal shape.<br>
(b)       The quantity PD2, which is defined as the amount of Ach or histamine needed to cause a doubling of the baseline pulmonary resistance, was calculated using the pulmonary resistance values derived from the flow and the pressure over a range of Ach or histamine challenges using the following equation (derived from the equation used to calculate PCjo values in the clinic (see Am. TJioracic Soc, 2000):<br>
(logC2-logC1)(2R0-RO PD2 = antilog [ log d+<br>
where:<br>
Ci - concentration of Ach or histamine preceding C2<br>
C2 - concentration of Ach or histamine resulting in at least a 2-fold increase in pulmonary resistance (RJ<br>
