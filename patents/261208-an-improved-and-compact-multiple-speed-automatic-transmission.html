CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional<br>
Application No. 60/909,778 filed on April 3, 2007. The disclosure of the above<br>
application is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIELD<br>
[0002] The invention relates generally to a multiple speed automatic<br>
transmission having a plurality of planetary gear sets and a plurality of torque<br>
transmitting devices and more particularly to an eight speed automatic<br>
transmission having four planetary gear sets and a plurality of torque transmitting<br>
devices.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may or may not constitute prior<br>
art.<br>
[0004] A typical multiple speed automatic transmission uses a<br>
combination of friction clutches, planetary gear arrangements and fixed<br>
interconnections to achieve a plurality of gear ratios. The number and physical<br>
arrangement of the planetary gear sets, generally, are dictated by packaging,<br>
cost and desired speed ratios.<br>
1<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P001097-PTT-DLT<br>
[0005] While current automatic transmissions achieve their intended<br>
purpose, the need for new and improved transmission configurations which<br>
exhibit improved performance, especially from the standpoints of efficiency,<br>
responsiveness and smoothness and improved packaging, primarily reduced<br>
size and weight, is essentially constant. Accordingly, there is a need for an<br>
improved, cost-effective, compact multiple speed automatic transmission.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0028] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is<br>
not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses.<br>
[0029] At the outset, it should be appreciated that in the particular<br>
example provided, the eight speed automatic transmission of the present<br>
invention has an arrangement of permanent mechanical connections between<br>
the elements of the four planetary gear sets. These permanent mechanical<br>
connections relate the transmission embodiments. More specifically, a first<br>
component or element of a first planetary gear set is permanently coupled to a<br>
first component or element of a second planetary gear set. A second component<br>
or element of the first planetary gear set is permanently coupled to a second<br>
component or element of the second planetary gear set and to a second<br>
component or element of a third planetary gear set. A third component or<br>
element of the second planetary gear set is permanently coupled to a third<br>
component or element of a fourth planetary gear set.<br>
[0030] Referring now to FIG. 1, a first embodiment of an eight speed<br>
automatic transmission 10 is illustrated in a lever diagram format. A lever<br>
diagram is a schematic representation of the components of a mechanical device<br>
such as an automatic transmission. Each individual lever represents a planetary<br>
gear set wherein the three basic mechanical components of the planetary gear<br>
are each represented by a node. Therefore, a single lever contains three nodes:<br>
one for the sun gear member, one for the planet gear carrier, and one for the ring<br>
gear member. The relative length between the nodes of each lever can be used<br>
9<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P001097-PTT-DLT<br>
to represent the ring-to-sun ratio of each respective gearset. These lever ratios,<br>
in turn, are used to vary the gear ratios of the transmission in order to achieve an<br>
appropriate ratios and ratio progression. Mechanical couplings or<br>
interconnections between the nodes of the various planetary gear sets are<br>
illustrated by thin, horizontal lines and torque transmitting devices such as<br>
clutches and brakes are presented as interleaved fingers. If the device is a<br>
brake, one set of the fingers is grounded. Further explanation of the format,<br>
purpose and use of lever diagrams can be found in SAE Paper 810102, which is<br>
hereby fully incorporated by reference.<br>
[0031] The automatic transmission 10 includes an input shaft 12, a first<br>
planetary gear set 14 having three nodes: a first node 14A, a second node 14B<br>
and a third node 14C, a second planetary gear set 16 having three nodes: a first<br>
node 16A, a second node 16B and a third node 16C, a third planetary gear set<br>
18 having three nodes: a first node 18A, a second node 18B and a third node<br>
18C, a fourth planetary gear set 20 having three nodes: a first node 20A, a<br>
second node 20B and a third node 20C, and an output shaft 22. The first node<br>
14A of the first planetary gear set 14 is coupled to the first node 16A of the<br>
second planetary gear set 16. The second node 14B of the first planetary gear<br>
set 14 is coupled to the second node 16B of the second planetary gear set 16.<br>
The second node 14B of the first planetary gear set 14 is coupled to the second<br>
node 18B of the third planetary gear set 18. The third node 16C of the second<br>
planetary gear set 16 is coupled to the third node 20C of the fourth planetary<br>
gear set 20.<br>
10<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P001097-PTT-DLT<br>
[0032] The input shaft 12 is coupled to the first node 20A of the fourth<br>
planetary gear set 20. The output shaft 22 is coupled to the first node 18A of the<br>
third planetary gear set 18. A first clutch 26 selectively connects the first node<br>
20A of the fourth planetary gear set 20 to the second node 16B of the second<br>
planetary gear set 16. A second clutch 28 selectively connects the first node 14A<br>
of the first planetary gear set 14 to the first node 18A of the third planetary gear<br>
set 18. A third clutch 30 selectively connects the second node 20B of the fourth<br>
planetary gear set 20 to the third node 18C of the third planetary gear set 18. A<br>
first brake 32 selectively connects the third node 14C of the first planetary gear<br>
set 14 to a ground, stationary member, or transmission housing 40. Finally, a<br>
second brake 34 selectively connects the second node 20B of the fourth<br>
planetary gear set 20 to a ground, stationary member, or transmission housing<br>
40.<br>
[0033] Referring now to FIG. 2, a stick diagram presents a schematic<br>
layout of an embodiment of the eight speed transmission 10 according to the<br>
present invention. In FIG. 2, the numbering from the lever diagram of FIG. 1 is<br>
carried over. The clutches, brakes and couplings are correspondingly presented<br>
whereas the nodes of the planetary gear sets now appear as components of<br>
planetary gear sets such as sun gear members, ring gear members, planet gears<br>
and planet gear carrier members.<br>
[0034] For example, the first planetary gear set 14 includes a first sun<br>
gear member 14B, a first ring gear member 14C, and a first planet carrier<br>
member 14A that includes a plurality of planet gears 14D rotatably disposed<br>
11<br><br>

thereon. The planet gears 14D are each intermeshed with both the first sun gear<br>
member 14B and the first ring gear member 14C. The second planetary gear set<br>
16 includes a second sun gear member 16B, a second ring gear member 16A,<br>
and a second planet carrier member 16C that includes a plurality of planet gears<br>
16D rotatably disposed thereon. The planet gears 16D are each intermeshed<br>
with both the second sun gear member 16B and the second ring gear member<br>
16A. The third planetary gear set 18 includes a third sun gear member 18C, a<br>
third ring gear member 18A, and a third planet carrier member 18B that includes<br>
a plurality of planet gears 18D rotatably disposed thereon. The planet gears 18D<br>
are each intermeshed with both the third sun gear member 18C and the third ring<br>
gear member 18A. The fourth planetary gear set 20 includes a fourth sun gear<br>
member 20B, a fourth ring gear member 20C, and a fourth planet carrier member<br>
20A that includes a first plurality of planet gears 20D and a second plurality of<br>
planet gears 20E rotatably disposed thereon. The planet gears 20D are each<br>
intermeshed with both the planet gears 20E and the fourth ring gear member<br>
20C. The planet gears 20E are each intermeshed with both the planet gears<br>
20D and the fourth sun gear member 20B.<br>
[0035] The input shaft 12 is coupled to and directly drives the fourth<br>
planetary carrier member 20A. A first shaft or interconnecting member 42<br>
couples the fourth ring gear member 20C to the second planet carrier member<br>
16C. A second shaft or interconnecting member 44 couples the first clutch 26 to<br>
the second sun gear member 16B. A third shaft or interconnecting member 46<br>
couples the fourth sun gear member 20B to the third clutch 30. A fourth shaft or<br>
12<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P001097-PTT-DLT<br>
interconnecting member 48 couples the second ring gear member 16A to the first<br>
planet carrier member 14A. A fifth shaft or interconnecting member 50 couples<br>
the second sun gear member 16B to the first sun gear member 14B. A sixth<br>
shaft or interconnecting member 52 couples the third clutch 30 to the third sun<br>
gear member 18C. A seventh shaft or interconnecting member 54 couples the<br>
second clutch 28 to the third ring gear member 18A. An eighth shaft or<br>
interconnecting member 56 couples the first sun gear member 14B to the third<br>
planet carrier member 18B. A ninth shaft or interconnecting member 58 couples<br>
the fourth planet carrier member 20A to the first clutch 26. A tenth shaft or<br>
interconnecting member 60 couples the first planet carrier member 14A to the<br>
second clutch 28.<br>
[0036] The first clutch 26 selectively couples the fourth planet carrier<br>
member 20A to the second sun gear member 16B and the first sun gear member<br>
14B. The second clutch 28 selectively couples the first planet carrier member<br>
14A to the third ring gear member 18A. The third clutch 30 selectively couples<br>
the fourth sun gear member 20B to the third sun gear member 18C. The first<br>
brake 32 selectively couples the first ring gear member 14C to a ground,<br>
stationary member, or transmission housing 40. The second brake 34 selectively<br>
couples the fourth sun gear member 20B to a ground, stationary member, or<br>
transmission housing 40. The output shaft 22 is coupled to and driven by the<br>
third ring gear member 18A.<br>
[0037] Referring now to FIGS. 2 and 3, the operation of the eight<br>
speed automatic transmission 10 will be described. It will be appreciated that the<br>
13<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P001097-PTT-DLT<br>
automatic transmission 10 is capable of transmitting torque from the input shaft<br>
12 to the output shaft 22 in eight forward speed or torque ratios and one reverse<br>
speed or torque ratio. Each forward and reverse speed or torque ratio is attained<br>
by engagement of one or more of the clutches or brakes as will be explained<br>
below. FIG. 3 is a truth table presenting the various combinations of clutches<br>
and brakes that are activated or engaged to achieve the various gear states.<br>
Actual numerical gear ratios of the various gear states are also presented<br>
although it should be appreciated that these numerical values are exemplary only<br>
and that they may be adjusted over significant ranges to accommodate various<br>
applications and operational criteria of the automatic transmission 10.<br>
[0038] To establish gear ratios, three torque transmitting devices are<br>
engaged for each gear state. The engaged clutches are represented by an "X" in<br>
each respective row. For example, to establish reverse gear, the first brake 32,<br>
the second clutch 28, and the third clutch 30 are engaged or activated. The first<br>
brake 32 couples the first ring gear member 14C to ground. The second clutch<br>
28 couples the first planet carrier member 14A to the third ring gear member<br>
18A. The third clutch 30 couples the fourth sun gear member 20B to the third<br>
sun gear member 18C. Likewise, the eight forward ratios are achieved through<br>
different combinations of clutch engagement as per FIG. 3.<br>
[0039] It will be appreciated that the foregoing explanation of operation<br>
and gear states of the eight speed automatic transmission 10 assumes, first of<br>
all, that all clutches and brakes not specifically referenced in a given gear state<br>
are inactive or disengaged and, second of all, that during gear member shifts,<br>
14<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P001097-PTT-DLT<br>
i.e., changes of gear state, between at least adjacent gear states, a clutch or<br>
brake engaged or activated in both gear states will remain engaged or activated.<br>
[0040] Turning now to FIG. 4, a lever diagram for another embodiment<br>
of an eight speed automatic transmission 100 is illustrated. The automatic<br>
transmission 100 includes an input shaft 112, a first planetary gear set 114<br>
having three nodes: a first node 114A, a second node 114B and a third node<br>
114C, a second planetary gear set 116 having three nodes: a first node 116A, a<br>
second node 116B and a third node 116C, a third planetary gear set 118 having<br>
three nodes: a first node 118A, a second node 118B and a third node 118C, a<br>
fourth planetary gear set 120 having three nodes: a first node 120A, a second<br>
node 120B and a third node 120C, and an output shaft 122.<br>
[0041] The input shaft 112 is coupled to the first node 120A of the<br>
fourth planetary gear set 120. The output shaft 122 is coupled to the first node<br>
118A of the third planetary gear set 118. The first node 114A of the first<br>
planetary gear set 114 is coupled to the first node 116A of the second planetary<br>
gear set 116. The second node 114B of the first planetary gear set 114 is<br>
coupled to the second node 116B of the second planetary gear set 116. The<br>
second node 114B of the first planetary gear set 114 is coupled to the second<br>
node 118B of the third planetary gear set 118. The third node 116C of the<br>
second planetary gear set 116 is coupled to the third node 120C of the fourth<br>
planetary gear set 120.<br>
[0042] A first clutch 126 selectively connects the first node 120A of the<br>
fourth planetary gear set 120 to the second node 116B of the second planetary<br>
15<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P001097-PTT-DLT<br>
gear set 116. A second clutch 128 selectively connects the second node 120B of<br>
the fourth planetary gear set 120 to the third node 118C of the third planetary<br>
gear set 118. A third clutch 130 selectively connects the first node 114A of the<br>
first planetary gear set 114 to the third node 118C of the third planetary gear set<br>
118. A first brake 132 selectively connects the second node 120B of the fourth<br>
planetary gear set 120 to a ground, stationary member, or transmission housing<br>
140. Finally, a second brake 134 selectively connects the third node 114C of the<br>
first planetary gear set 114 to a ground, stationary member, or transmission<br>
housing 140.<br>
[0043] Referring now to FIG. 5, a stick diagram presents a schematic<br>
layout of the second embodiment of the eight speed transmission 100 according<br>
to the present invention. In FIG. 5, the numbering from the lever diagram of FIG.<br>
4 is carried over. The clutches, brakes and couplings are correspondingly<br>
presented whereas the nodes of the planetary gear sets now appear as<br>
components of planetary gear sets such as sun gear members, ring gear<br>
members, planet gears and planet gear carrier members.<br>
[0044] For example, the first planetary gear set 114 includes a first sun<br>
gear member 114C, a first ring gear member 114A, and a first planet carrier<br>
member 114B that includes a plurality of planet gears 114D rotatably disposed<br>

gear member 114C and the first ring gear member 114A. The second planetary<br>
gear set 116 includes a second sun gear member 116C, a second ring gear<br>
member 116B, and a second planet carrier member 116A that includes a plurality<br>
16<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P001097-PTT-DLT<br>

ring gear member 116B. The third planetary gear set 118 includes a third sun<br>
gear member 118B, a third ring gear member 118C, and a third planet carrier<br>
member 118A that includes a plurality of planet gears 118D rotatably disposed<br>
thereon. The planet gears 118D are each intermeshed with both the third sun<br>
gear member 118B and the third ring gear member 118C. The fourth planetary<br>
gear set 120 includes a fourth sun gear member 120C, a fourth ring gear<br>
member 120B, and a fourth planet carrier member 120A that includes a plurality<br>
of planet gears 120D rotatably disposed thereon. The planet gears 120D are<br>
each intermeshed with both the fourth sun gear member 120C and the fourth ring<br>
gear member 120B.<br>
[0045] The input shaft 112 is coupled to and directly drives the fourth<br>
planetary carrier member 120A and the first clutch 126. A first shaft or<br>
interconnecting member 142 couples the fourth sun gear member 120C to the<br>
second sun gear member 116C. A second shaft or interconnecting member 144<br>
couples the fourth ring gear member 120B to the second clutch 128. A third<br>
shaft or interconnecting member 146 couples the second planet carrier member<br>
116A to the first ring gear member 114A. A fourth shaft or interconnecting<br>
member 148 couples the second ring gear member 116B to the first planet<br>
carrier member 114B. A fifth shaft or interconnecting member 150 couples the<br>
first ring gear member 114A to the third clutch 130. A sixth shaft or<br>
interconnecting member 152 couples the first planet carrier member 114B to the<br>
17<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P001097-PTT-DLT<br>
third sun gear member 118B. A seventh shaft or interconnecting member 154<br>
couples the second clutch 128 to the third ring gear member 118C. An eighth<br>
shaft or interconnecting member 156 couples the third clutch 130 to the third ring<br>
gear member 118C.<br>
[0046] The first clutch 126 selectively couples the fourth planet carrier<br>
member 120A and the input shaft 112 to the second ring gear member 116B and<br>
the first planet carrier member 114B. The second clutch 128 selectively couples<br>
the fourth ring gear member 120B to the third ring gear member 118C. The third<br>
clutch 130 selectively couples the first ring gear member 114A to the third ring<br>
gear member 118C. The first brake 132 selectively couples the fourth ring gear<br>
member 120B to a ground, stationary member, or transmission housing 140.<br>
The second brake 134 selectively couples the first sun gear member 114C to a<br>
ground, stationary member, or transmission housing 140. The output shaft 122<br>
is coupled to and driven by the third planet carrier member 118A.<br>
[0047] Referring now to FIGS. 5 and 6, the operation of the eight<br>
speed automatic transmission 100 will be described. It will be appreciated that<br>
the automatic transmission 100 is capable of transmitting torque from the input<br>
shaft 112 to the output shaft 122 in eight forward speed or torque ratios and one<br>
reverse speed or torque ratio. Each forward and reverse speed or torque ratio is<br>
attained by engagement of one or more of the clutches or brakes as will be<br>
explained below. FIG. 6 is a truth table presenting the various combinations of<br>
clutches and brakes that are activated or engaged to achieve the various gear<br>
states. Actual numerical gear ratios of the various gear states are also presented<br>
18<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P001097-PTT-DLT<br>
although it should be appreciated that these numerical values are exemplary only<br>
and that they may be adjusted over significant ranges to accommodate various<br>
applications and operational criteria of the automatic transmission 100.<br>
[0048] To establish gear ratios, three torque transmitting devices are<br>
engaged for each gear state. The engaged elements are represented by an "X"<br>
in each respective row. For example, to establish reverse gear, the first brake<br>
132, the second clutch 128, and the third clutch 130 are engaged or activated.<br>
The first brake 132 couples the fourth ring gear member 120B to ground. The<br>
second clutch 128 couples the fourth ring gear member 120B to the third ring<br>
gear member 118C. The third clutch 130 couples the first ring gear member<br>
114A to the third ring gear member 118C. Likewise, the eight forward ratios are<br>
achieved through different combinations of clutch engagement as shown in FIG.<br>
6.<br>
[0049] It will be appreciated that the foregoing explanation of operation<br>
and gear states of the eight speed automatic transmission 100 assumes, first of<br>
all, that all clutches and brakes not specifically referenced in a given gear state<br>
are inactive or disengaged and, second of all, that during gear member shifts,<br>
i.e., changes of gear state, between at least adjacent gear states, a clutch or<br>
brake engaged or activated in both gear states will remain engaged or activated.<br>
[0050] The description of the invention is merely exemplary in nature<br>
and variations that do not depart from the gist of the invention are intended to be<br>
within the scope of the invention. Such variations are not to be regarded as a<br>
departure from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
