CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This patent application is a continuation in part of Serial No. 10/116,309 which was filed on April 3, 2002.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field Of The Invention<br>
The present invention relates to novel compounds capable of modulating, regulating and/or inhibiting tyrosine kinase signal transaction. The present invention is also directed to methods of regulating, modulating or inhibiting tyrosine kinases, whether of the receptor or non-receptor class, for the prevention and/or treatment of disorders related to unregulated tyrosine kinase signal transduction, including cell growth, metabolic, and blood vessel proliferative disorders.<br>
2,	Description Of The Related Art<br>
Protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) comprise a large and diverse class of proteins having enzymatic activity. The PTKs play an. important role in the control of cell growth and differentiation.<br>
For example, receptor tyrosine kinase mediated signal transduction is initiated by extracellular interaction with a specific growth factor (ligand), followed by receptor dimerization, transient stimulation of the intrinsic protein tyrosine lcinase activity and phosphorylation. Binding sites are thereby created fox intracellular signal transduction molecules and lead to the formation of complexes with a spectrum of cytoplasroic signaling molecules that facilitate the appropriate<br>
1<br><br>
cellular response (e.g., cell division, metabolic homeostasis, and responses to the extracellular micro environment).<br>
With respect to receptor tyrosine kinases, it has been shown also that tyrosine phosphorylation sites function as high-affinity binding sites for SH2 (src homology) domains of signaling molecules. Several intracellular substrate proteins that associate with receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) have been identified. They may be divided into two principal groups: (1) substrates which have a catalytic domain; and (2) substrates which lack such domain but serve as.adapters.and associate with catalytically active molecules. The specificity of the interactions between receptors or proteins and SH2 domains of their substrates is determined by the amino acid residues immediately surrounding the phosphorylated tyrosine residue. Differences in the binding affinities between SH2 domains and the amino acid sequences surrounding the phosphotyrosine residues on particular receptors are consistent with the observed differences in their substrate phosphorylation profiles. These observations suggest that the function of each receptor tyrosine kinase is determined not only by its pattern of expression and ligand availability but also by the array of downstream signal transduction pathways that are activated by a particular receptor. Thus, phosphorylation provides an important regulatory step which determines the selectivity of signaling pathways recruited by specific growth factor receptors, as well as differentiation factor receptors.<br>
Aberrant expression or mutations in the PTKs have been shown to lead to either uncontrolled cell proliferation (e.g. malignant tumor growth) or to defects in key developmental processes. Consequently, the biomedical community has expended significant resources to discover the specific biological role of members of the PTK family, their function in differentiation processes, their involvement in tumorigenesis and in other diseases, the biochemical mechanisms underlying their signal transduction pathways activated upon ligand stimulation and the development of novel drugs.<br>
2<br><br>
Tyrosme kinases can be of the receptor-type (having extracellular, transmembrane and intracellular domains) or the non-receptor type (being wholly intracelluiar).<br>
The RTKs comprise a large family of transmembrane receptors with diverse biological activities. The intrinsic function of RTKs is activated upon ligand binding, which results in phophorylation of the receptor and multiple cellular substrates, and subsequently in a variety of cellular responses.<br>
At present, at least nineteen (19) distinct RTK subfamilies have been identified. One RTK subfamily, designated the HER subfamily, is believed to be comprised of EGFR, HER2, HER3 and HER4. Ligands to the Her subfamily of receptors include epithelial growth factor (EGF), TGF-a, amphiregulin, HB-EGF, betacellulin and heregulin,<br>
A second family of RTKs, designated the insulin subfamily, is comprised of the INS-R, the IGF-IR and the IR-R. A third family, the "PDGF" subfamily includes the PDGF a and ß receptors, CSFIR, c-kit and FLK-II Another subfamily of RTKs, identified as the FLK family, is believed to be comprised of the Kinase insert Domain-Receptor fetal liver kinase-1 (KDR/FLK-1), the fetal liver kinase 4 (FLK-4) and the fins-like tyrosine kinase 1 (flt-1). Each of these receptors was initially believed to be receptors for hernatopoietic growth factors. Two other subfamilies of RTKs have been designated as the FGF receptor family (FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3 and FGFR4) and the Met subfamily (c-met and Ron).<br>
Because of the similarities between the PDGF and FLK subfamilies, the two subfamilies are often considered together. The known RTK subfamilies are identified in Plowman et al, 1994, DN&amp;P 7(6): 334-339, which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The non-receptor tyrosine kinases represent a collection of cellular enzymes which lack extracellular and transmembrane sequences. At present, over twenty-four individual non-receptor tyrosine kinases, comprising eleven (11) subfamilies (Src, Frk, Btk, Csk, Abl, Zap70, Fes/Fps, Fak, Jak, Ack and LMK) have been<br>
3<br><br>
identified: At present, the Src subfamily of non-receptor tyrosine kinases is comprised of the largest number of PTKs and include Src, Yes, Fyn, Lyn, Lck, Blk, Hck, Fgr and Yrk, The Src subfamily of enzymes has been linked to oncogenesis. A more detailed discussion of non-receptor tyrosine kinases is provided in Bolen, 1993, Oncogen 8: 2025-2031, which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Many of the tyrosine kinases, whether an RTK or non-receptor tyrosine kinase, have been found to be involved in cellular signaling pathways leading to cellular signal cascades leading to pathogenic conditions, including cancer, psoriasis and hyper immune response.<br>
In view of the surmised importance of PTKs to the control, regulation and modulation of cell proliferation the diseases and disorders associated with abnormal cell proliferation, many attempts have been made to identify receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinase "inhibitors" using a variety of approaches, includingihe use of mutant ligands (U.S. Patent No. 4,966,849), soluble receptors, and antibodies (PCT Application No. WO 94/10202; Kendall &amp; Thomas, 1994, Proc. Nal'l Acad, Sci 90:10705-09; Kirn, et al, 1993, Nature 362: 841-844), RNA ligands (Jellinek, et al, Biochemistry 33: 10450-56); Takano, et al, 1993, Mol. Bio. Celi 4:358A; Kinsella, et al, 1992, Exp. Cell Res. 199: 56-62; Wright, et al, 1992, J. Cellular Phys. 152: 448-57) and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (PCT Application Nos. WO 94/03427; WO 92/21660; WO 91/15495; WO 94/14808; U.S. Patent No. 5,330,992; Mariani; et al,1994, Proc. Am. Assoc, Cancer Res. 35:-2268).<br>
More recently, attempts have been made to identify small molecules which act as tyrosine kinase inhibitors, For example, bis monocyclic, bicyclic or heterocyclic aryl compounds (PCT Application No. WO 92/20642), vinylene-azaindole derivatives (PCT Application No. WO 94/14808) and 1-cyclopropyl-4-pyridyl-quinolones (U.S. Patent No. 5,330,992) have been described generally as tyrosine kinase inhibitors."Styryl compounds (U.S. Paten No. 5,217,999), styryl-substituted pyridyl compounds (U.S. Patent No75,302,606), certain quinazoline derivatives (EP Application No. 0 566 266 Al), seleoindoles and selenides (PCT<br>
4<br><br>
Application No. WO 94/03427), tricyclic polyhydroxylic compounds (PCT Application No. WO 92/21-660)andbenzylphosphonic acid compounds (PCT Application No. WO 91/15495) have been described as compounds for use as tyrosine kinase inhibitors for use in the treatment of cancer.<br>
The identification of effective small compounds which specifically inhibit signal transduction by modulating the activity of receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinases to regulate and modulate abnormal or inappropriate cell proliferation is therefore desirable and one object of this invention.<br>
Finally, certain small compounds are disclosed in U.S. Patents 5,792,783; 5,834,504; 5,883,113; 5,883,116 and 5,886,020 as useful for the treatment of diseases related to unregulated TKS transduction. These patents are hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety for the purpose of disclosing starting materials and methods for the preparation thereof, screens and assays to determine a claimed compound's ability to modulate, regulate and/or inhibit cell proliferation, indications which are treatable with said compounds, formulations and routes of administration, effective dosages, etc.<br>

The present invention relates to compounds capable of regulating and/or modulating tyrosine kinase signal transduction and more particularly receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinase signal transduction.<br>
Receptor tyrosine kinase mediated signal transduction is initiated by extracellular interaction with a specific growth factor (ligand), followed by receptor<br>
12<br><br>
dimerization, transient stimulation of the intrinsic protein tyrosine kinase activity and phosphorylation. Binding sites are thereby created for intracellular signal transduction molecules and lead to the formation of complexes with a spectrum of cytoplasmic signaling molecules that facilitate the appropriate cellular response<br>
(e.g., cell division, metabolic effects and responses to the extracellular microenvironment).<br>
It has been shown that tyrosine phosphorylation sites in growth factor receptors function as high-affinity binding sites for SH2 (src homology) domains of signaling molecules. Several intracellular substrate proteins that associate with<br>
receptor tyrosine kinases have been identified. They may be divided into two principal groups: (1) substrates which have a catalytic domain; and (2) substrates which lack such domain but serve as adapters and associate with catalytically active molecules. The specificity of the interactions between receptors and SH2 domains of their substrates is determined by the amino acid residues immediately<br>
surrounding the phosphorylated tyrosine residue. Differences in the binding affinities between SH2 domains and the amino acid sequences surrounding the phosphotyrosine residues on particular receptors are consistent with the observed differences in their substrate phosphorylation profiles. These observations suggest that the function of each receptor tyrosine kinase is determined not only by its<br>
pattern of expression and ligand availability but also by the array of downstream signal transduction pathways that are activated by a particular receptor. Thus, phosphorylation provides an important regulatory step which determines the selectivity of signaling pathways recruited by specific growth factor receptors, as well as differentiation factor receptors.<br>
Tyrosine kinase signal transduction results in, among other responses, cell proliferation, differentiation and metabolism. Abnormal cell proliferation may result in a wide array of disorders and diseases, including the development of neoplasia such as carcinoma, sarcoma, leukemia, glioblastoma, hemangioma, psoriasis, arteriosclerosis, arthritis and diabetic retinopathy (or other disorders<br>
13<br><br>
related to uncontrolled angiogenesis and/or vasculogenesis, e.g. macular degeneration).<br>
This invention is therefore directed to compounds which regulate, modulate and/or inhibit tyrosine kinase signal transduction by affecting the enzymatic activity of the RTKs and/or the non-receptor tyrosine kinases and interfering with the signal transduced by such proteins. More particularly, the present invention is directed to compounds which regulate, modulate and/or inhibit the RTK and/or non-receptor tyrosine kinase mediated signal transduction pathways as a therapeutic approach to cure many kinds of solid tumors, including but not limited, to carcinoma, sarcoma, leukemia, erythroblastoma, glioblastoma, meningioma, astrocytoma, melanoma and myoblastoma. Indications may include, but are not limited to brain cancers, bladder cancers-ovariainrancers, gastric cancers, pancreas cancers, colon cancers, blood cancers lung ancers and bone cancers.<br>
Biological data for the compounds of the present invention was generated by use of the following assays. VEGF Stimulated Ca++ Signal in vitro<br>
. Automated FLIPR (Fluorometric Imaging Plate Reader) technology was used to screen for inhibitors of VEGF induced increases in intracellular calcium levels in fluorescent dye loaded endothelial cells. HUVEC (human umbilical vein endothelial cells) (Clonetics) were seeded in 96-well fibronectin coated black-walled plates overnight @ 37°C/5%CO2. Cells were loaded with calcium indicator Fluo-4 for 45 minutes at 37°C. Cells were washed 4 times (Original Cell Wash, Labsystems) to remove extracellular dye. For screening, cells were pre-incubated with test agents for 30 minutes at a single concentration (1 OuM) or at concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 10.0 uM, followed by VEGF stimulation (5ng/mL). Changes in fluorescence at 516 nm were measured simultaneously in all 96 wells using a cooled CCD camera. Data were generated by determining max-min fluorescence levels for unstimulated, stimulated, and drug treated samples.<br>

IC50 values for test compounds were calculated from % inhibition of VEGF stimulated responses in the absence of inhibitor. Protocol for KDR Assay:<br>
The cytoplasmic domain of the human VEGF receptor (VEGFR-2) was expressed as a Histidine-tagged fusion protein following infection of insect cells using an engineered baculovirus. kis-VEGFR-2 was purified to homogeneity, as determined by SDS-PAGE, using nickel resin chromatography. Kinase assays were performed in 96 well microtiter plates that were coated overnight with 30µg of poly-Glu-Tyr (4:1) in 10mM Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS), pH 7.2-7.4 . The plates were incubated with 1% BSA and then washed four times with PBS prior tp starting the reaction. Reactions were carried out in 120µL reaction volumes containing 3.6µM ATP in kinase buffer (50mM Hepes pH 7.4, 20mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM MnCI2 and 0.2 mM Na3VO4). Test compounds were reconstituted in 100% DMSO and added to the reaction to give a final DMSO concentration of 5%. Reactions were initiated by the addition 0.5 ng of purified protein. Following a ten minute incubation at 25° C, the reactions were washed four times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20. 100ul of a monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosme antibody-peroxidase conjugate was diluted 1:10000 in PBS-Tween-20 and added to the wells for 30 minutes. Following four washes with PBS-Tween-20, 100µl of 0-Phehylenediamine Dihydrochloride in Phosphate-citrate buffer, containing urea hydrogen peroxide, was added to the wells for 7 minutes as a colorimetric substrate for the peroxidase. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 100ul of 2.5N H2SO4 to each well and read using a microplate ELISA reader set at 492 nm. IC50 values for compound inhibition were calculated directly from graphs of optical density (arbitrary units) versus compound concentration following subtraction of blank values.<br>
