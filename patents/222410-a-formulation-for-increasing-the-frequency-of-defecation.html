MEDICINES FOR RELIEVING INTESTINAL DISORDERS<br>
FIELD OF ART<br>
The present invention relates to an agent, for relieving<br>
intestinal disorders<br>
It is known that a variety of microorganisms live and form<br>
microorganic flora in an intestinal tract of humans and animals.<br>
Such microorganisms are classified into harmful microorganisms<br>
that give harmful effects to the host, and beneficial<br>
microorganisms that give beneficial effects to the host. These<br>
microorganisms keep symbiotic or antagonistic relationship.<br>
The harmful microorganisms may be those which produce harmful<br>
products sucn as ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, and amines to place<br>
an excessive burden on liver function, and those which relates<br>
to carcinogenesis. The harmful microorganisms may include<br>
genus Clostndium.<br>
Beneficial effects that are given to the host through<br>
improvement of intestinal flora may include a variety of effects<br>
that will lead to good intestinal environment which is necessary<br>
for the host to maintain a healthy life, such as (1) amelioration<br>
of gastrointestinal condition such as diarrhea or constipation,<br>
(2) prevention of cancer and improvement of infection<br>
resistivity through activation of immune system, and (3)<br>
suppression of metabolic production of, e.g. harmful enzymes,<br>
by the harmful microorganisms. Effective use of the<br>
microorganic flora for the health of the host is the idea of<br>
so-called probiotics.<br>
There are some proposal for definition of probiotics, such<br>
as "a microorganism and a substance that give beneficial effect<br>
to a host through control of intestinal flora" (Parker, R.B: An.<br>
Nutr. Health, 29, 4-8 (1974)), "a live microorganism that gives<br>
beneficial effect to a host by improvement of balance of<br>
intestinal florae" (Fullar, R. : J. Appl. Bacteriol., 66, 365-378<br>
(1989)), "a strain of or mix-cultured bacteria that give a<br>
beneficial effect to a host by amelioration of factors relating<br>
to balance of intestinal florae in the host" (Havenaar, R. and<br>
Huis in't Veld, J.H.J.: A general view, In The Lactic Acid<br>
Bacteria in Health and Disease/Wood, B.J.B. ed., pp.151-170<br>
(1992) Elsevier, London), "live bacteria and substances<br>
promoting proliferation of such bacteria that give a beneficial<br>
effect to inherent flora of not only animals but also plants and<br>
foods" (Fullar, R.: Probiotics: Their Development and Use, In<br>
Old Herborn University Seminar Monograph 8/van der Waaij, D.,<br>
Heidt, P.J. and Rush, V.C. eds., pp.1-8 (1995) Institute for<br>
Microbiology and Biochemistry, Herborn-Dill) (see The Japanese<br>
Journal of Nutrition and Dietetics Vol.55 No. 4 p!67-177: 1997) .<br>
In any case, a substance that is called probiotics has a function<br>
of relievinq intestinal disorders.<br>
It is reported that some of lactic acid bacteria have such<br>
probiotic properties. Specifically, it is known that some<br>
strains of Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Streptococcus thermophilus,<br>
Lactobacillus acidophilus, various bifidobacteria,<br>
Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus gasseri have probiotic<br>
properties. More specifically, it is known that Lactobacillus<br>
plantarum 299DSM6596, Lactobacillus casei ssp. rhamnosus<br>
271DSM6595 (Japanese Patent No. 2742962 B) , Lactobacillus<br>
acidophilus PN-RI-2-4 (JP-P-H5-292947 A), Lactobacillus<br>
acidophilus F-133 (Japanese Patent No.3052208 B),<br>
bifidobacteria BB536, and Lactobacillus casei Shirota strain<br>
have probiotic properties.<br>
Particularly, as to the lactic acid bacteria of genus<br>
Lactobacillus, L. acidophilus, L. agilis, L. aviarius, L.<br>
amylovorus, L. brevis, L. casei, L. crispatus, L. delbrueckii<br>
subsp. bulgaricus, L. gallinarum, L. gasseri, L. johnsonii, L.<br>
murinus, L. hamsteri, L. intestinalis, L. plantarum, L. reuteri,<br>
L. ruminis, and L. salivarius are at present recognized as<br>
probiotics (probiotics A Critical Review: Gerald W. Tannock<br>
(1997) p47).<br>
By the way, it is reported that (1) Lactobacillus<br>
helveticus has high proteolytic activity and thus has high<br>
peptide productivity, and (2) a Lactobacillus helveticusfermented<br>
milk has an hypotensive effect (Japanese Patent<br>
Mo.3026411 Bi . Therefore, it is known that an extracellular<br>
product obtained by fermenting a milk with Lactobacillus<br>
helveticus may be used as lactic acid fermented milk material<br>
with suppressed lactic acid acidity (JP-P-H10-99018 A),<br>
stimulant for interferon production (JP-P-S57-1237 A) , and lipid<br>
metabolism improver {JP-P-H10-229841 A). However, it is not<br>
known that the live bacterial cells of Lactobacillus helveticus<br>
may be administered to hosts such as humans for use as an agent<br>
for relieving intestinal disorders having a probiotic function.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide an agent<br>
for relieving intestinal disorders that , when administered to<br>
a subject such as a human, leads to effects such as increased<br>
frequency of defecation and is therefore useful for improving<br>
the intraintestinal environment.<br>
According to the present invention, there is provided an<br>
agent for relieving intestinal disorders comprising live<br>
bacterial cells of a strain belonging to Lactobacillus<br>
helveticus.<br>
According to the present invention, there is also provided<br>
a method for controlling intestinal function comprising the step<br>
of administering to a subject in need thereof an effective amount<br>
of the agent for relieving intestinal disorders.<br>
EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The agent for relieving intestinal disorders of the<br>
present invention contains live bacterial cells of a strain<br>
belonging tc Lactobacillus helveticus.<br>
The strain belonging to Lactobacillus helveticus is<br>
preferably resistant against bile acid. Specifically, the<br>
minimum growth inhibitory concentration of dry solid bile for<br>
the strain in a bile acid resistivity test may preferably be 0.8%<br>
or more, arid more preferably 1.3% or more.<br>
The minimum growth inhibitory concentration of the dry<br>
solid bile is the minimum concentration of the dry solid bile<br>
at which concentration the bile can inhibit growth of the strain.<br>
Specifically, the minimum growth inhibitory concentration may<br>
be measured oy preparing a liquid medium in which the strain<br>
belonging to Lactobacillus helveticus can grow (e.g., MRS<br>
medium), adding a variety of concentrations (e.g., 0, 0.05, 0.1,<br>
0.3, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0%) of dry solid bile to the medium,<br>
culturing the strain in each medium, measuring turbidity (e.g.,<br>
at 650nm) by e.g., absorptiometer after the lapse of certain<br>
periods of time (e.g., 0, 4, 8 and 12 hours) to determine specific<br>
growth rate (CD/time) at the logarithmic growth phase, and<br>
calculating the concentration of the dry solid bile at which the<br>
specific growth rate becomes zero by extrapolation of the<br>
relationship between the dry solid bile concentration and the<br>
specific growth rate. The dry solid bile may specifically be<br>
Bacto-cxgall (product name, manufactured by Difco<br>
Laboratories '• .<br>
The strain belonging to Lactobacillus helveticus<br>
preferably has adhesiveness of 2.8 x 106 cells/well or more, and<br>
preferably 4.5 x 10s cells/well or more to a monolayer culture<br>
of Caco-2 cells in an intestinal tract epithelium cell<br>
adhesiveness test in a cylindrical well having a bottom surface<br>
area of 1,8 cur.<br>
The adhesiveness to the intestinal epithelium cells may<br>
specifically be tested, for example, in accordance with the<br>
Greene and Klaenhammer's method (Greene, J.D. and Klaenhammer,<br>
T.R. Applied and Environmental Microbiology 60, 4487-4494<br>
(1994) ) . More specifically, for example, 1ml of cultured liquid<br>
containing 1 x 10s cells/ml of Caco-2 cells may be poured in a<br>
cylindrical well having the bottom surface area of 1.8 cm2, and<br>
cultured until a monolayer is formed. Number of the cells of<br>
the strain that can adhere to the monolayer of the cultured Caco-2<br>
cells per well may be measured. A strain exhibiting cell number<br>
that is not less than the aforementioned preferable number may<br>
preferably used.<br>
The strain belonging to Lactobacillus helveticus may<br>
preferably be those which exhibits fecal recovery in humans of<br>
4.0 x 10' cells or more following administration of the strain<br>
at the dose of 1.0 x 1011 cells.<br>
The amount of the cells of the strain from the collected<br>
feces may be measured by the following method: the strain is made<br>
resistant against an antibiotic such as rifampicin in accordance<br>
with an ordinary method; the resistant bacteria are administered<br>
to a human subject; the feces of the subject is collected after<br>
the administration; and the number of the bacterial cells in the<br>
feces is counted utilizing the antibiotic resistivity. The<br>
amount of the strain in the collected feces may also be measured<br>
by detecting genes derived from the strain in the feces in<br>
accordance with an ordinary method.<br>
As the strain belonging to Lactobacillus helveticus, a<br>
variety of strains such as Lactobacillus helveticus CP53 strain<br>
(International Patent Organism Depositary of National Institute<br>
of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, deposition number<br>
FERM BP-577C ) may be used. Lactobacillus helveticus CP53 strain<br>
is particularly preferable.<br>
Lactobacillus helveticus CP53 strain has been deposited<br>
at National Institute of Bioscience and Human-Technology Agency<br>
of Industrial Science and Technology (which is at present called<br>
International Patent Organism Depositary of National Institute<br>
of Advanced industrial Science and Technology) on January 11,<br>
1996 as the deposition number FERM BP-5770, and is now publicly<br>
available.<br>
The formulation of the present agent for relieving<br>
intestinal disorders is not particularly limited and may be any<br>
of solids such as powders, granules and tablets; and fluids such<br>
as pastes, gels and liquids.<br>
The amount of the live bacterial cells of the strain in<br>
the agent for relieving intestinal disorders of the present<br>
invention is not particularly limited. However, the amount may<br>
preferably be those which enables ingestion of 1.0 x 1011 or more<br>
of the live bacterial cells at one administration. Specifically,<br>
the content of the live bacteria may be 1.0 x 106 cells/g to 1.0<br>
x 1011 cells/g, and preferably 1.0 x 10s cells/g to 1.0 x 1011<br>
cells/g.<br>
Although the method for producing the agent for relieving<br>
intestinal disorders may not be limited, the agent may be produced<br>
by fermenting milk with a strain belonging to Lactobacillus<br>
helveticus, to obtain live bacterial cells of the strain<br>
belonging to Lactobacillus helveticus. The milk may be animal<br>
milk such as cow's milk, horse milk, goat milk and sheep milk;<br>
and vegetable milk such as soybean milk. The fermentation<br>
temperature may be 20°C to 50°C, and preferably 30°C to 45°C. The<br>
fermentation time may preferably be 3 to 48 hours, and preferably<br>
6 to 24 hours. The fermented product itself obtained by<br>
fermentation of the milk with the strain belonging to<br>
Lactobacillus helveticus may be utilized as the agent for<br>
relieving intestinal disorders of the present invention. The<br>
fermented product may further be admixed with other materials<br>
such as other additives and food materials, and optionally<br>
processed to be in a form such as powders, granules and tablets,<br>
for use as the agent for relieving intestinal disorders of the<br>
present invention. Alternatively, the live bacterial cells of<br>
the strain belonging to Lactobacillus helveticus cultured in<br>
accordance with the aforementioned fermentation or other methods<br>
may be collected from the medium, and the collected bacteria<br>
itself may be utilized as the agent for relieving intestinal<br>
disorders of the present invention. The collected bacteria may<br>
further be admixed with other materials such as other additives<br>
and food materials, and optionally processed to be in a form such<br>
as powders, granules and tablets, for use as the agent for<br>
relieving intestinal disorders of the present invention.<br>
The subject to which the agent for relieving intestinal<br>
disorders of the present invention is administered may be animals<br>
such as mammals including humans, without limitation.<br>
The dose of the agent for relieving intestinal disorders<br>
of the present invention may be 1.0 x 1011 cells in terms of number<br>
of the live bacterial cells per one day in the case of human.<br>
The agent may be administered at a time or a plurality of times.<br>
When the agent for relieving intestinal disorders of the<br>
present invention is administered to an animal including human,<br>
it may result in relief of intestinal disorders represented by<br>
increased frequency of defecation and amount of feces.<br>
The agent for relieving intestinal disorders of the<br>
present invention gives an effect such as the increased frequency<br>
of defecation when administered to an animal such as a human,<br>
and is therefore useful for improving the intraintestinal<br>
environment.<br>
EXAMPLES OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention will be explained more in detail<br>
with reference to the Examples. However, the present invention<br>
is not limited thereto.<br>
In the following Examples, adhesiveness to Caco-2 cells<br>
was measured as follows:<br>
Test of Adhesiveness to Caco-2 Cells<br>
Adhesiveness to Caco-2 cells was measured in accordance<br>
with Greene and Klaenhammer's method. Caco-2 cells purchased<br>
from American Type Culture Collection (HTB-37) in MEM medium<br>
(Gibco BRL) containing 5% calf serum albumin (Gibco Bethesda<br>
Reserarch Laboratory) that had been inactivated by heating at<br>
55°C for 30 minutes were cultured at 37°C in 5% C02 incubator.<br>
1 ml of the cultured liquid containing I x 10s cells/ml was<br>
transferred to a cultivation plate having 24 wells (manufactured<br>
by Sumitomo Bakelite Co. , Ltd. , trade name MS-80240 ) . The medium<br>
was exchanged every 48 hours until the cells form a monolayer.<br>
O.lml of 20% glutaraldehyde (Wako Pure Chemical Industries,<br>
Ltd. ) was added for fixing the cells to the culturing plate . The<br>
plate was left stand for 30 minutes and washed two times with<br>
PBS. 0.5 ml (1 x 109 cells) of a liquid containing cells to be<br>
tested that had been isotope-labeled were added. After<br>
culturing at 3"/°c for one hour, free cells were removed by washing<br>
the plate three times. 200 ul of 1%SDS, IN NaOH was added and<br>
left stand for 30 minutes. The mixture of the Caco-2 cell and<br>
the bacterial cells were recovered from the wells, and suspended<br>
in a scintillator cocktail (Scintisol EX-H, Wako Pure Chemical<br>
Industries, Ltd.) and radio activity thereof was measured with<br>
a liquid scintillation counter LSC-900 (Aloka Co.,Ltd.) . The<br>
number of the cells adhered was calculated on the basis of<br>
specific radioactivity of the cells that had previously been<br>
counted. The measurement was performed twice and average was<br>
taken as the result.<br>
Example 1<br>
Lactobacillus Helveticus CP53 strain<br>
Lactobacillus helveticus CP 53 strain is known to have<br>
therein a plasmid DNA, pCP53 (Yamamoto, N. andTakano, T.: Biosci.<br>
Biotech. Biochem., 60 (12), 2069-2070 (1996)). Lactobacillus<br>
helveticus CP53 strain was cultured in a variety of MRS mediums<br>
each containing different concentration of solid bile powders<br>
(Bacto-oxgali. (Difco) ) for measuring minimum growth inhibitory<br>
concentration . The minimum growth inhibitory concentration was<br>
found to be 1.31%. Adhesiveness to Caco-2 cells was also<br>
measured and confirmed to be 4.5 x 106 cells/well or more.<br>
Conferring Rifampicin Resistance<br>
For recovery from feces in the ingestion test, resistance<br>
against the antibiotic rifampicin was conferred to CP53 strain<br>
in accordance with an ordinary method. The CP53 strain was<br>
spread on a MRS plate medium containing 100|ag/ml of rifampicin.<br>
The rifampicin-resistant strain that grew on this plate medium<br>
was selected as CP53-R strain.<br>
Properties of CP53-R Strain<br>
CP53-R strain was subcultured seven times in MRS medium<br>
that did not contain rifampicin. The subcultured strain was<br>
cultured in a variety of MRS mediums each containing different<br>
concentration of solid bile powders for measuring the minimum<br>
growth inhibitory concentration, which was found to be 0.86%.<br>
Adhesiveness to Caco-2 cells was also measured and confirmed to<br>
be 2 . 6 x 10° cells/well or more . Further, this subcuitured strain<br>
was confirmed to contain the plasmid pCP53.<br>
Ingestion-recovery Test on Volunteers<br>
CP53-R strain cultured in MRS medium (Difco) was collected<br>
by centrifugation, washed twice with PBS, and suspended in cow's<br>
milk at a concentration of I x 1011 cells/lOOml. The milk<br>
suspension containing CP53-R strain was employed as an ingestion<br>
sample for the ingestion-recovery test. Seven healthy subjects<br>
at the age of 25 to 41 drunk 100 ml of the ingestion sample at<br>
once. All of feces defecated from the subjects within 5 days<br>
from the ingestion were collected. Frequency of defecation, and<br>
amount and hardness of feces from each subject after<br>
administration of the ingestion sample were recorded. The<br>
results are shown in Table 1. The collected feces was<br>
immediately frozen and stored at 4°C, and the following analyses<br>
were performed on the next day.<br>
Survival of L. Helveticus<br>
Utilieing the MRS plate medium containing rifampicin,<br>
number of live bacterial cells having rifampicin resistance in<br>
the feces samples was counted. The number of bacterial cells<br>
contained in all of the collected feces was calculated. As a<br>
result, average number of recovered bacterial cells per person<br>
was 1.2 x 10G cells. It was confirmed that all of the bacteria<br>
survived on the MRS plate medium containing rifampicin had the<br>
plasmid pC?53, i.e., they were CP53-R strain.<br><br>
Intraintestinal Growth of L. Helveticns<br>
CP53 strain cells were washed twice with PBS, and<br>
subjected to alkaline bacteriolysis with lOmg/ml lysozyme<br>
(Seikagaku Corporation) and Img/ml of mutanolysin (Seikagaku<br>
Corporation;, to prepare pCP53 plasmid DNA. The DNA was then<br>
purified by high speed centrifugation with CsCl density gradient,<br>
and radioisotope-labeled with Random Primer DNA Labeling Kit ver<br>
2.0 (Takara Bio Inc.) and [a-32P] dCTP (222TBq/mmol, New Life<br>
Products Inc. ) , to obtain a 32P radio-labeled pCP53 plasmid DNA.<br>
In a centrifugation tube of 15ml volume, 5ml of 30% sucrose<br>
solution, 2ml of 20% sucrose solution and 2ml of 10% sucrose<br>
solution were calmly piled up, to obtain a step density gradient<br>
sucrose solution. The feces sample collected from the subjects<br>
was diluted 20 times (w/w) and suspended in a distilled water,<br>
and 0.5ml of the suspension was laid on the step gradient sucrose<br>
solution. The laid liquids were centrifuged for five minutes<br>
at 1500 x g. 10% and 20% sucrose fractions were collected, and<br>
washed twice with sterilized water. A DNA fraction was obtained<br>
by the Leenhouts1 method (Leenhouts, K.J., Kok, J., and Venema,<br>
G. il990) Appl. Environ. Microbiol., 56, 2726-2735). The<br>
obtained DNA fraction was dissolved in lOmM Tris Cl pH 8.0, ImM<br>
EDTA. 10 and 100 times dilutions of the solution with the same<br>
buffer were also prepared. These DNA fractions were heated for<br>
three minutes and 10 jj.1 each thereof was dot-blotted on a nylon<br>
membrane (Hybcnd-NT, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The blotted<br>
nylon membrane was washed with distilled water and dried, to fix<br>
DNA.<br>
To the fixed DNA on the membrane, the aforementioned<br>
radio-labeled pCP53 plasmid DNA was hybridized in accordance<br>
with Maniatis' method (Maniatis, T. , Frish, E.F. and Sambrook,<br>
J. (1987) Molecular Cloning; a laboratory manual. Cold Spring<br>
Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor). Upon hybridization,<br>
formaldehyde and chromosomal DNA derived from a variety of<br>
bacteria in separately prepared feces that did not contain CP53<br>
strain were added thereto at 50% (w/w) andlOug/ml, respectively,<br>
for avoiding non-specific hybridization.<br>
For quantification of pCP53 plasmid, the membrane after<br>
hybridization was subjected to autoradiography, and each sample<br>
dot portion (0.5 x 0.5 mm) was cut off. Radio activity of the<br>
taken dot portions were measured with a liquid scintillation<br>
counter LSC-900 (Aloka Co., Ltd.).<br>
Separately, for obtaining a calibration curve, 8.5 x 10J<br>
to 2.0 :
feces samples, which were subjected to the aforementioned DNA<br>
fraction preparation, dot-blotting and reaction with radiolabeled<br>
pCP53 plasmid DNA. The bound radioactivity was in linear<br>
proportion to number of CP53 strain cells that had been mixed<br>
with feces in a range of 8.5 x 103 to 2.0 x 105 cells/g (weight<br>
of feces), and a calibration line was thus obtained. With this<br>
calibration line, amount of CP53 strain cells in the feces samples<br>
from the ingestior.-recovery test subjects was determined in a<br>
range of 1 x 1Q4 to 2.0 x 105 cells/g (weight of feces).<br>
As a result, CP53 strain cells were found in all of the<br>
feces samples collected from the seven subjects. Number of total<br>
CP53 strain ceils in all of feces samples from each subject was<br>
4.0 x 109, 1.0 x 109, 3.0 x 109, 1.0 x 109, 1.0 x 109, 4.0 x 107<br>
and 4.0 x 10° cells, respectively. In each subject, CP 53 strain<br>
was found in all of the feces samples of the first, second and<br>
third defecation after taking the ingestion sample. The amounts<br>
of CP53 strain cells in the feces samples of the third and<br>
subsequent defecation were greater than that of the first and<br>
second defecation. This fact suggests that CP53 strain can grow<br>
and proliferate in the intestinal tract even it can hardly grow<br>
in feces.<br>
Feces from subjects who had not ingested CP53-R live<br>
bacteria was also taken as feces sample, and DNA fractions were<br>
prepared therefrom in the same way as the above. These DNA<br>
fractions and purified pCP53 plasmid DNA were dot-blotted and<br>
reacted with the radio-labeled pCP53 plasmid DNA in the same way.<br>
As a result:, the radio-labeled pCP53 plasmid DNA strongly reacted<br>
with purified pCP53 plasmid, but did not react at all with the<br>
DNA fractions derived from the feces from the subjects who had<br>
not ingested GP53-R live bacteria.<br>
Comparative Example 1<br>
Example .1 was followed except that the ingestion sample<br>
was heat-sterilized before administration to the subjects.<br>
Frequency of aefecation, and amount and hardness of the feces<br>
of each subject were recorded. The results are shown in Table1.<br>

Average was calculated.<br>
FormulationExample 1<br>
1.485kg of skim milk powders (manufactured by Yotsuba<br>
Inc.) were dissolved in 8 . 415kg of purified water . The solution<br>
was neat-sterilized at 95°C for 30 minutes and then quickly cooled<br>
down to 32°C. To the recombined and sterilized skim milk was<br>
aseptically added 0.1 kg of bulk starter of Lactobacillus<br>
helveticus CP 53 strain. The mixture was thoroughly stirred and<br>
fermented at 32°C for 16 to 20 hours. The fermentation was<br>
terminated when the acidity of the fermented milk (weight<br>
percentage of lactic acid) reached in a range of 1.5 to 2.1.<br>
After finishing the fermentation, the fermented milk was quickly<br>
cooked down to 10°C or less to obtain 10kg of fermented milk<br>
material. A:: that time, number of live CP53 strain cells per<br>
Ig reached at least 1.5 billion.<br>
0.8kg of granulated sugar powders and 0.03kg of pectin<br>
YM115-H powders (manufactured by Copenhagen Pectin) were mixed<br>
and dissolved in 4.17kg of purified water warmed at 70°C. The<br>
solution was heat-sterilized at 95°C for several seconds and then<br>
quickly cooled down to 10°C or less to obtain 5kg of sterilized<br>
sugar-stabilizer solution.<br>
5kg of the fermented milk material was aseptically added<br>
to 5kg of the sterilized sugar-stabilizer solution and the<br>
mixture was aseptically homogenized with a laboratory<br>
homogenizer (type: 15M-8BA, manufactured by APV Gaulin) at the<br>
homogenizing pressure of 15MPa and processing flow rate of<br>
2.5L/min, to obtain 10kg of dairy lactic acid bacteria beverage<br>
bulk. The dairy lactic acid bacteria beverage bulk was<br>
aseptically poured into polystyrene bottles of 200g size. The<br>
bottles were heat-sealed with polyethylene-aluminum laminated<br>
films, to obtain dairy lactic acid bacteria beverage products<br>
having quality preservation period of 14 days in refrigerator<br>
The obtained product contained at least 750 million CP53<br>
strain cells per Ig. When preserved at 10°C or less, the product<br>
was able to maintain 500 million live bacterial cells per Ig even<br>
at 14 days after production. Therefore, drinking 200 g of the<br>
product results in ingestion of 100 billion or more of live CP53<br>
bacterial cells.<br>
Formulation Example 2_<br>
0.180kg of skimmed soybean milk powders (trade name<br>
"Soyafit 2000" manufactured by Fuji Oil Co. , Ltd.) was dissolved<br>
in 1. 738g of purified water, which was then admixed with 0 . 080kg<br>
of lactose and 0.002kg of yeast (trade name "Ebios P2G"<br>
manufactured by Asahi Breweries, Ltd.) and stirred. The mixture<br>
was sterilized at 95°C for several seconds and then quickly cooled<br>
down to 25°C. To the recombined and sterilized skim soybean milk<br>
thus obtained was aseptically added 0.060kg of bulk starter of<br>
Lactobacillus helveticus CP53 strain. The mixture was<br>
thoroughly stirred and fermented at 37°C for 24 to 48 hours with<br>
stirring at 100 rpm. The fermentation was terminated when the<br>
acidity of the fermented milk reached in a range of 1.5 to 2.1.<br>
After finishing the fermentation, the fermented soyabean milk<br>
was quickly cooled down to 10°C or less to obtain 2kg of fermented<br>
soyabean milk material. At that time, number of live CP53<br>
bacterial ceils per Ig reached at least 2 billion.<br>
0.44kg of granulated sugar powders and 0.015kg of pectin<br>
YM115-H powders (manufactured by Copenhagen Pectin) were mixed<br>
and dissolved in 3.56kg of purified water warmed at 70°C. The<br>
solution was heat-sterilized at 95°C for several seconds and then<br>
quickly cooled down to 10°C or less to obtain 4kg of sterilized<br>
sugar-stabilizer solution.<br>
2kg of the fermented soyabean milk material was<br>
aseptically added to 4kg of the sterilized sugar-stabilizer<br>
solution and the mixture was aseptically homogenized with a<br>
laboratory homogenizer (type: 15M-8BA, manufactured by APV<br>
Gaulin) at: the homogenizing pressure of ISMPa and processing flow<br>
rate of 2 . 5L/min, to obtain 6kg of soyabean lactic acid bacteria<br>
beverage bulk. The soyabean lactic acid bacteria beverage bulk<br>
was asepticaily poured into polystyrene bottles of 200g size.<br>
The bottles were heat-sealed with polyethylene-aluminum<br>
laminated films, to obtain soyabean lactic acid bacteria<br>
beverage products having quality preservation period of 14 days<br>
in refrigerator (10°C or less).<br>
The obtained product contained at least 660 million CP53<br>
strain cells per Ig. When preserved at 10°C or less, the product<br>
was able to maintain 500 million live bacterial cells per Ig even<br>
at 14 days after production. Therefore, drinking 200 g of the<br>
product; results in ingestion of 100 billion or more of live CP53<br>
bacterial cells.<br><br><br><br>
