3.   PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is  to be  performed : -<br><br>
The invention relates to a driving rod drive according to the preamble of Claim 1.<br>
Driving rod drives of said type are already known, for example from DE 23 45 496 Al. The known driving rod drive is composed of a housing in which a gearwheel is rotatably mounted. The gearwheel can be driven, for example manually by means of a hand 1 ever, by means of a polygonal receptacle and a polygonal mandrel which extends through said polygonal receptacle. The gearwheel is assigned a driving rod which is moveable along the housing and which carries locking elements which interact with positionally  fixed  locking engagement portions of the frame.<br>
The driving rod interacts indirectly or directly with the toothing of the gearwheel, for example by virtue of the teeth of the gearwheel engaging into recesses of the driving rod. In order to ensure the drive connection and in order to fasten the drive to the casement or leaf, abutments for fastening elements for example of the hand lever are provided in the housing, which abutments are designed as threaded bores which run parallel to the rotational axis of the gearwheel.<br>
The known housing is composed of two housing halves in which in each case one of the bearing arrangements of the gearwheel is arranged. Attached between the housing halves are spacers which contain the abutments for the fastening elements of the hand lever and contain the fastening means for the connection to the plates.<br>
The driving rod drive can thereby be produced from a small number of individual parts, specifically the gearwheel, the two housing halves, the two spacers, the driving rod and a cuff rail which closes off the driving rod drive.<br>
A disadvantage here is however that the insertion of the spacers requires a comparatively high level of expenditure in that in each case two components must be handled. In the case of the configuration in question, the driving rods and the cuff rails must be constituent parts of the drive, that is to say all the components must be assembled together. Even if the housing halves, like the gearwheel and the spacers,<br>
2<br><br>
can be used for a wide variety of driving rod drives, this constitutes a high level of expenditure in production terms, since the relatively long cuff rails and driving rods can only be handled with difficulty in automated assembly plants.<br>
Furthermore, the shape of the housing halves is only limitedly suitable for automated assembly of the driving rod drive on account of the connecting elements.<br>
It is therefore an object of the invention to provide a driving rod drive which is composed of individual parts which are simple and cost-effective to produce and thereby also permits simple assembly.<br>
Said object is achieved for a generic driving rod drive by the implementation of the features of the characterizing part of Claim 1.<br>
The embodiment permits the production of both housing halves by means of a punching and bending process, so that said housing halves can be produced very simply and cost-effectively in large numbers without the mechanical stability being adversely affected as a result. Here, the handling of only a single spacer facilitates assembly regardless of whether said handling is carried out manually or in an automated fashion. Since the spacer is also formed from a sheet metal section, the production here can also be carried out very cost-effectively. Since the two housing halves are identical, these can be separated and supplied very easily in an assembly device. The spacer connects the plates here already so that the cuff rail which is otherwise provided according to the prior art need not be used for this purpose. Said cuff rail can thus be attached to the already-finished housing or to the subassembly at a later time. In this way, the assembly can be divided substantially into two partial steps. In a first partial step, the housing is produced from the two plates and the gearwheel by the one spacer. In a second working step, the finished housing is mounted on the cuff rail together with the driving rod.<br>
3<br><br>
The stock-holding of driving rod drives is thereby relieved, since the housing can be produced and stored in large numbers, while the cuff rails and driving rods which are to be designed according to the dimensions of the respective windows or doors can be produced in lesser numbers.<br>
Further advantageous embodiments can be gathered from Claims 2 to 10.<br>
According to Claim 2, the transversely-running web should be assigned to the gearwheel at the side facing towards the driving rod, and be penetrated here by the gearwheel close to its bearing arrangement in a slotted opening. This allows the driving rod drive to be of more compact design while having increased load capacity. If the spacer - as viewed from the driving rod - were arranged behind the gearwheel, then the housing would have to be correspondingly enlarged in this direction, which would also result in a larger installation space. The fastening of the two plates would thereby also be provided only in the edge region of the plates, such that said constituent part would require special and careful handling during the further production of the driving rod drive. The solution proposed here also permits, in addition to the more compact design, a significantly less sensitive design of the housing as an individual part of the driving rod drive. The arrangement found generates a U-shaped installation space which is delimited on the one hand by the plates laterally and on the other hand by the spacer transversely with respect thereto.   Said  installation space serves as a guide for the driving rod.<br>
In order to be able to make the utilization of the individual constituent parts useful also for other required dimensions of the driving rod drive, it is provided that the gearwheel interacts only indirectly via an intermediate piece with the driving rod, and the intermediate piece is guided by the housing halves and the spacer. In connection in particular with the above-specified guidance, this results in a simplification of the driving rod drive, since the intermediate piece requires no additional guidance in the housing. This allows the intermediate piece to also be inserted in a simple manner into the installation space from above; said intermediate<br>
4<br><br>
piece therefore likewise need not be mounted together with the housing. The device which is used to assemble the driving rod drives in which the gearwheel interacts directly with the driving rod, and the device for assembling the driving rod drives with the intermediate piece, can therefore be identical if the device can hold both housing dimensions. The assembly device is therefore utilized to a greater degree, which in turn reduces costs.<br>
One refinement provides that the bearing arrangement of the gearwheel in the plate is formed by a funnel-shaped opening which is drawn inward. As a result of this measure, a larger bearing surface of the gearwheel in the housing is generated, and the wall thickness of the plates can be reduced without the bearing surface of the gearwheel being reduced. The production of the funnel-shaped opening is also facilitated here as a result of the lower plate thickness. The bearing pins of the gearwheel also interact, on account of the design in the loading direction, not with the punched edge of the opening but rather with the un-machined face of the plate, such that the expected wear is reduced.<br>
For cost-effective production of the driving rod drive, it is also advantageous if the spacer has a substantially T-shaped cross section. This shaping permits simple production from the sheet metal section. A U-shaped spacer, which is likewise conceivable according to Claim 1, would be more complex in production terms.<br>
The manual as well as the automated production of the driving rod drive is simplified by virtue of the plates being designed so as to be symmetrical transversely with respect to the longitudinal axis. The transverse synmietry allows the housing or the plates to be assembled without any mix-up. The required expenditure is reduced in particular when separating the plates.<br>
It is also provided that the gearwheel is designed as a disc body which is extrusion-coated with plastic, and the bearing pins which project beyond the disc plane are<br>
5<br><br>
formed from the plastic. This also allows the gearwheel to be formed as a simple punched body and allows the bearing pins to be configured optimally. It is possible in particular in connection with the measures according to Claim 4 to realize a material combination and workpiece shape which has a positive effect on the wear behaviour.<br>
In order to be able to maintain the symmetry of the housing, it is also provided that the plates have bends which point towards one another and which are supported on a web of. the opposite plate or on the spacer. It would of course be conceivable to form on the plates in each case one web or bend which projects in the direction of the in each case other plate, with the webs or bends of the plates being situated opposite one another point-symmetrically with respect to the rotational axis of the gearwheel. Each of the bends would then bear directly against the in each case other plate. This would however result in the symmetry of the plates no longer being ensured, such that this would influence the design of the assembly device. The bends result in additional support of the plates relative to the spacer and therefore also relative to one another. The support is preferably provided in the region of the fastening elements of the hand lever and of an elongation of the T-shaped web of the T-shaped spacer, such that the rear-side housing edge of the driving rod drive is stabilized.<br>
It is finally also provided that the elements for connecting the spacer to the plates are composed of projecting material sections which extend through the openings in the plates. Fastening or assembly elements which must additionally be handled can thereby be dispensed with, and the assembly device is in turn simplified.<br>

In the case of the driving rod drive 1 illustrated in Figure 1, the cuff rail is denoted by 2 and the driving rod by 3. The driving rod drive 1 has, as shown by Figures 1 to 8/ a housing 4 which itself is composed of the housing halves 5, 6, the pinion 7 and the spacer 8.<br>
The housing 4 can be fixed to the cuff rail 2 by means of fastening lugs 9 which project at the front side and engage in corresponding recesses 10 of said cuff rail   2.<br>
7<br><br>
For this purpose, the fastening lugs 9 are designed such that, after insertion, they project slightly beyond the recesses 10 and can be plastically deformed by means of a riveting or wobbling process.<br>
As shown by Figures 2, 4 and 5, the spacer 8 is connected in the same way to the housing halves 5, 6. The housing halves 5, 6 are composed of thin sheet metal plates which are substantially planar, as can be seen from Figures 2 and 5. The spacer 8 penetrates said plates 5, 6, by means of the fastening lugs 12, in apertures 11 which are provided for this purpose.<br>
In order to ensure the drive of the gearwheel 7, the latter is provided with a polygonal receptacle and is rotatably mounted in the housing 5. The drive is provided usually manually by means of a hand lever (not illustrated here) which is attached at the inner side of the structure to the casement or leaf and is fastened thereto by means of two fastening screws. The fastening screws have their abutment in the threaded bores 13 which are provided in the spacer 8 and run parallel to the rotational axis 14 of the gearwheel 7.<br>
The driving rod 3, which is moveable along the housing 30 4, is drive-connected to the gearwheel 7 in a known way by means of a driving bar toothing.<br>
It can also be seen from Figures 1 and 3 and from Figures 2 or 5 that the housing halves are composed of identical plates 5, 6. The plates 5, 6 therefore have congruent outer contours, and the recesses, apertures and bends also correspond to one another. The embodiment of the substantially planar housing halves from plates 5, 6 allows both housing halves to be produced by means of a punching and bending process, such that said housing halves can be produced very simply and cost-effectively in high numbers. The plates 5, 6 are also formed so as to be transversely symmetrical, that is to say they are of mirror-symmetrical design about the line VII-VII in Figure 3 which runs transversely with respect to the longitudinal axis. The transverse symmetry allows the housing 4 to be assembled or<br>
8<br><br>
the plates 5, 6 to be used without any mix-up. The required expenditure for this is reduced in particular in the separation of the plates 5, 6 in automated assembly.<br>
The spacer 8 is also composed of a bent sheet metal section which has at least one web 15 (Figures 4 and 5) which runs along the rotational axis 14 of the gearwheel 7 and which is assigned to the plates 5, 6 for the purpose of fastening. This is however also shown in particular by Figure 6 in which the substantially T-shaped cross section is clear. Said T-shape permits simple production from the sheet metal section. A u-shaped spacer 8, which is likewise conceivable, would be complex in terms of production. The design is clear from Figures 9 to 11 and Figure 12, in which the spacer 8 can be seen in a three-dimensional illustration. The web 15 forms a base from which the ears 16, 17 project at the respective longitudinal end. The ears 16, 17 are material sections which have been set up perpendicularly out of the plane of the sheet metal section. The ears 16, 17 are provided at their free ends 18 with a widened portion such that the threaded bores 13 are surrounded by a sufficient material section. Provided in the web 16 is a slotted opening 19 whose function will be described below. The web 15 is provided at its two longitudinal edges 20, 21 with the projecting fastening lugs 12. Also provided at the longitudinal edge 20, close to the end, is an alignment projection 22 which serves to engage into the recesses 23 (Figures 1, 3, 8) and to provide positionally accurate alignment of the spacer 8 to the plate 5 or 6.<br>
In connection with Figure 9, it is also clear here that the spacer 8, like the plates 5, 6, is designed so as to be transversely symmetrical with respect to the transverse axis<br>
24.	At the same time, however, the functional elements which can come into<br>
interaction with the other components, specifically the fastening projections 12 and<br>
the ears 16,17, are also situated symmetrically with respect to the longitudinal axis<br>
25.	Accordingly, the spacer 8 can be positioned invertedly on the plate 5 or 6 without<br>
this adversely affecting the function of the driving rod drive 1. When<br>
assembling the spacer 8 onto the plate 5 or 6, it is therefore unimportant as to<br>
9<br><br>
whether the longitudinal edge 20 or the longitudinal edge 21 bears against the plate 5. An automated supply of the spacers 8 can therefore be significantly simplified.<br>
It is also clear here from Figure 11 that the spacer has the already mentioned T-shaped cross section. The technology required for producing the spacer is restricted to a known punching and bending technique which permits a cheap and yet resilient design. As a result of the longitudinal dimension of the spacer 8 corresponding approximately to the spacing of the threaded bores which act as fastening elements and as a result of said spacer encompassing both abutments within it, the handling of an if appropriate additional second spacer or of a fastening element is eliminated.<br>
Since the two plates 5, 6 which form the housing halves are identical, said plates 5, 6 can be separated and supplied in an assembly device. The spacer 8 connects the plates 5, 6 here already so that the cuff rail 2 which is otherwise provided according to the prior art need not be present for this purpose. Said cuff rail can thus be attached at a later time to the already-finished subassembly composed of the plates 5, 6, the pinion 7 and the spacer 8. In this way, the assembly can be divided substantially into two partial steps. In a first partial step, the housing 4 is produced from the two plates 5, 6 and the gearwheel 7 by the one spacer 8. In a second working step/ the housing 4 which is finished in this way is then mounted on the cuff rail 2 together with the driving rod 3.<br>
This also simplifies the stock-holding of the driving rod drives 1, since the housing 4 can be produced and stored in large numbers, while the cuff rails 2 and driving rods 3 which are to be designed in different dimensions according to the dimensions of the respective windows or doors can be produced in lesser numbers.<br>
It is also clear from Figure 7 that the transversely-running web 15 is assigned to the gearwheel 7 at the side facing towards the driving rod 3 or the cuff rail 2, and is penetrated here by the gearwheel 7 close to the bearing arrangement in the plates 5,<br>
10<br><br>
6 in the already mentioned slotted opening 19. This allows the driving rod drive 1 to be of more compact design while having increased load capacity. If the spacer 8 - as viewed from the driving rod 3 - were arranged behind the gearwheel 7, that is to say for example in the direction of the centre of the figure in Figure 1, then the housing 4 would have to be correspondingly enlarged in this direction, which would also result in a larger installation space on the casement or leaf. The fastening of the two plates 5, 6 would then also be provided only in the edge region of the plates 5, 6, such that the entire subassembly would require special and careful handling during the further production of the driving rod drive 1.<br>
A further advantage is provided in connection with Figures 13 to 17. In the exemplary embodiment of the driving rod drive 1 illustrated here, the gearwheel 7 interacts only indirectly via an intermediate piece 30 with the driving rod 3. The driving rod drive 1 which should be equipped with said housing 4 has a relatively large spacing of the rotational axis 14 to the cuff rail 2. For this purpose, the gearwheel 7 is assigned the intermediate piece 30 which on the one hand is drive-connected by means of the toothing 31 to the gearwheel 7 and on the other hand can engage by means of the pins 32 into corresponding recesses of the driving rod 3 (not illustrated here).<br>
A U-shaped installation space (Figure 17) is generated in the housing 4 on the one hand as a result of the plates 5, 6 and on the other hand as a result of the spacer 8, which U-shaped installation space serves as a guide for the driving rod 3 and the intermediate piece 30. The intermediate piece 30 therefore requires no additional guidance in the housing 4 since it is engaged around at three sides by the housing 4 and is ultimately captively mounted in the housing 6 by means of the cuff rail which is to be fastened last of all. In the illustrated exemplary embodiment, the intermediate piece 30 is however nevertheless fastened and guided by means of laterally projecting pins 33 to the housing 4. Said design makes it possible for the intermediate piece 30 to likewise be included in the subassembly composed of the gearwheel 7, the two plates 5,6 and the spacer 8.<br>
11<br><br>
The first-mentioned embodiment thus makes it possible for the device for assembling the driving rod drives 1 as per Figure 1, in which the gearwheel 7 interacts directly with the driving rod 3, and the device for assembling the driving rod drives 1 with the intermediate piece 30, to be of identical design. The corresponding receptacles in the device are merely to be matched to the different dimensions of the plates 5, 6 by means of the spacers 8 and gearwheels 7 which are used in both of said two cases. Proceeding from the axis 14 of the gearwheel 1, however, identical fastening points of the plates 5, 6 to the spacer 8 are generated for both embodiments. The assembly device is thereby utilized to a greater degree in terms of time, which in turn reduces costs.<br>
It can also be gathered from Figure 15 that the gearwheel 7 is designed as a disc body which is extrusion-coated with plastic/ and the bearing pins 34 which project beyond the disc plane are formed from the plastic. This also allows the gearwheel 7 to be formed as a simple punched body and allows the bearing pins to be configured optimally. By means of a suitable material selection, it is possible for the wear behaviour of the gearwheel 7 in the bearing arrangement to be positively influenced and to realize an expedient workpiece shape in a comparatively simple way.<br>
The bearing arrangement of the gearwheel 7 in the plate 5 or 6 is formed by a funnel-shaped opening 35 which is drawn inward, as can be seen in Figures 17 and 18 and in Figures 8 and 16. The funnel-shaped opening 35 generates a collar 36 which forms a relatively large bearing surface for the bearing pins 34 of the gearwheel 7 in the housing 4. In this way. the wall thickness of the plates 5, 6 can be reduced without the bearing surface of the gearwheel 7 being reduced. The production of the funnel-shaped opening 35 or of the collar 36 is also facilitated here as a result of the lower plate thickness. The bearing pins 34 of the gearwheel 7 also interact, on account of the design in the loading direction, not with the rough punched edge of the opening 35 but rather with the un-machined face of the plate 5 and 6, such that the expected wear is further reduced.<br>
12<br><br>
The design of the opening 18 can be more clearly seen from the enlarged detail illustrations of Figures 18, 19 and 20. The collar 36 forms, at its inner side, the bearing shell 37 in which is seated the bearing pin 34 which runs coaxially with respect to the rotational axis 14. The opening 35 is also provided with a section 38 which, unlike the collar 36, is drawn inward. Said section 38 is in fact aligned in the plane of the plate 5, 6 and has two lugs 39 which project radially with respect to the rotational axis 14. The lugs 39 bear, in the assembled state, against the end faces 40 of the bearing pins 34 (Figures 8 and 13). Situated on the end faces 40, or at least on one of the end faces, is an axial appendage 41 which, in the assembled state of the gearwheel 7, is situated between the lugs 39. The appendage 41 provides a defined relative alignment of the gearwheel 7 with respect to the housing 4 or its plates 5 or 6. During the first actuation of the driving rod drive 1, the appendage 41 is sheared off against the lugs 39.<br>
The plates 5, 6 for the driving rod drive 1 according to the first exemplary embodiment (Figure 20} have bends 42 (Figures 2, 5 and 8) which point towards one another and which are situated opposite a bend 42 of the opposite plate 6, 5 or the spacer 8. The bend 42 serves to guide the driving rod 3. In the illustrated exemplary embodiment, the bends 43 are supported on the spacer 8. It would of course be conceivable to form on the plates 5, 6 in each case one bend 43 which projects in the direction of the in each case other plate 5, 6, with the bends 43 of the plates 5, 6 being situated opposite one another in each case point-symmetrically with respect to the rotational axis 14 of the gearwheel 7. Each of the bends would then bear directly against the in each case other plate 5 or 6. This would however result in the symmetry of the plates 5, 6 no longer being ensured, such that this would influence the design of the assembly device. Longer projecting bends 43 would also bring with them the risk of being deformed during transport and during the further machining in particular of the surfaces.<br>
The bends 43 provide additional support of the plates 5, 6 relative to the spacer 8 and therefore also relative to one another. The support is preferably provided in<br>
13<br><br>
the region of the fastening elements, that is to say of the threaded bores 13 of the hand lever and of the widened portion of the ends 18, such that the rear-side housing edge of the driving rod drive 1 is stabilized. The fastening screws of the hand lever extend through the plates 5, 6 at bores 44 which are provided for this purpose. If the fastening screws are tightened too tightly, the spacer 8 could be deformed. By means of the bends 43, it is provided that the spacer 8 can be supported on the plates 5, 6 and therefore also in a bracket-holding groove of the casement or leaf.<br>
