				<td>Process for Removal of Impurities from an Oxidizer Purge Stream<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to the removal of impurities and the recovery of<br>
a mother liquor and a wash filtrate from an oxidizer purge stream produced<br>
in the synthesis of carboxylic acid, typically terephthalic acid, and then<br>
subsequently routing at least a portion of the mother liquor and/or wash<br>
filtrate back to an oxidation zone comprising at least one oxidation reactor.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Terephthalic acid is commercially produced by oxidation of<br>
paraxylene in the presence of a catalyst, such as, for example, Co, Mn, Br<br>
and a solvent. Terephthalic acid is used in the production of polyester<br>
fibers, films, and resins and must be further treated to remove impurities<br>
formed as a result of the oxidation of paraxylene.<br>
Terephthalic acid (TPA) is an intermediate in the production of<br>
polyesters for plastics and fiber applications. An example of a process for<br>
manufacturing TPA is shown in figure 1. Commercial processes for the<br>
manufacture of TPA are often based on the heavy-metal catalyzed<br>
oxidation of p-xylene, generally with a bromide promoter in an acetic acid<br>
solvent or the combinations of these can be known as the reaction mixture<br>
405. Due to the limited solubility of TPA in acetic acid under practical<br>
oxidation conditions, a slurry of TPA crystals is usually formed in the<br>
oxidation zone 400 which comprises at least one oxidation reactor.<br>
Typically, the TPA oxidizer slurry 410 is withdrawn from the oxidation zone<br>
400, and TPA solids can then be separated from the oxidizer mother liquor<br>
415 in a TPA solid liquid separation zone 430, using conventional solidliquid<br>
separation techniques. The oxidizer mother liquor 415, which contains<br>
most of the catalyst and promoter used in the process, is recycled to the<br>
oxidation zone 400 comprising at least one reactor. Aside from the catalyst<br>
and promoter, the oxidizer mother liquor 415 also contains dissolved TPA<br>
and many by-products and impurities. These by-products and impurities<br>
arise partially from minor impurities present in the p-xylene feed stream.<br>
Other impurities arise due to the incomplete oxidation of p-xylene resulting<br>
in partially oxidized products. Still other by-products result from competing<br>
side reactions formed as a result of the oxidation of p-xylene to terephthalic<br>
acid. Patents disclosing the production of terephthalic acid such as U.S<br>
patent #4,158,738 and #3,996,271 are hereby incorporated by reference in<br>
their entirety to the extent that they do not contradict statements herein.<br>
The TPA solids can undergo a solid-liquid separation wherein fresh<br>
solvent 420 is utilized to displace a major portion of the liquid component of<br>
the oxidizer mother liquor 415. After drying, the TPA solids are<br>
contaminated with impurities that were present in the oxidizer mother liquor<br>
415 since these impurities may be incorporated into the TPA solids.<br>
Impurities are also present due to occlusions in the TPA crystal structure<br>
and due to incomplete removal of the oxidizer mother liquor 415 by the<br>
fresh solvent wash 420.<br>
Many of the impurities in the oxidizer mother liquor 415 stream that is<br>
recycled are relatively inert to further oxidation. Such impurities include, for<br>
example, isophthalic acid, phthalic acid and trimellitic acid. Impurities, which<br>
may undergo further oxidation are also present, such as, for example, 4-<br>
carboxybenzaldehyde, p-toluic acid and p-tolualdehyde. Oxidation inert<br>
impurities tend to accumulate in the oxidizer mother liquor 415 upon<br>
recycle. The concentration of these inert impurities will increase in the<br>
oxidizer mother liquor 415 until an equilibrium is reached whereby the rate<br>
of removal of each impurity via the TPA product balances with the rate of<br>
formation and the rate of addition to the oxidation process. The normal level<br>
of impurities in commercial terephthalic acid makes it unsuitable for direct<br>
use in most polymer applications.<br>
Conventionally, terephthalic acid has been purified either by<br>
conversion to a dimethyl ester or by dissolution in water with subsequent<br>
hydrogenation over standard hydrogenation catalysts. More recently,<br>
secondary oxidative treatments have been used to produce polymer-grade<br>
TPA. It is desirable to minimize the concentration of impurities in the<br>
mother liquor and thereby facilitate subsequent purification of TPA. In some<br>
cases, it is not possible to produce a purified, polymer-grade TPA unless<br>
some means for removing impurities from the oxidizer mother liquor 415 is<br>
utilized.<br>
One technique for impurity removal from a recycle stream<br>
commonly used in the chemical processing industry is to draw out or<br>
"purge" some portion of the oxidizer mother liquor 415 that is recycled.<br>
Typically, the purge stream is simply disposed of or, if economically<br>
justified, subjected to various treatments to remove undesired impurities<br>
while recovering valuable components. One example is U.S. #4,939,297<br>
herein incorporated by reference in their entirety to the extent that they do<br>
not contradict statements herein. The amount of purge required for control<br>
of impurities is process-dependent; however, a purge amount equal to 10-<br>
40%, hereafter known as oxidizer purge stream 101, of the total oxidizer<br>
mother liquor 415 stream that is recycled is usually sufficient to produce<br>
TPA adequate as feedstock for commercial polymer manufacture. However,<br>
in an embodiment of the invention a purge amount up to 100% could be<br>
used.<br>
In the production of TPA, the percentage purge of the oxidizer<br>
mother liquor 415 necessary to maintain acceptable impurity<br>
concentrations, coupled with the economic value of the metal catalyst and<br>
solvent components in the oxidizer purge stream 101, make simple disposal<br>
of the oxidizer purge stream 101 economically unattractive. Thus, there is a<br>
need for a process that recovers a major portion of the valuable metal<br>
catalysts and acetic acid contained in the oxidizer purge stream 101 while<br>
removing a major portion of the impurities present in the oxidizer purge<br>
stream 101. The metal catalyst can be recovered in an active form suitable<br>
for reuse by direct recycling to the p-xylene oxidation step.<br>
Disclosed is an invention to recover a wash filtrate 148 and mother<br>
liquor 147 from an oxidizer purge stream. The oxidizer purge stream 101 is<br>
sent to a separation zone and then the mother liquor/and or wash filtrate is<br>
recycled back to an oxidation reactor. In should be noted that the above<br>
described TPA process is for example only. The disclosed invention can<br>
apply to many different TPA processes that are capable of producing an<br>
oxidizer purge stream 101. Therefore, it should be noted that this invention<br>
does not just apply to the terephthalic acid process, but any process that<br>
produces an oxidizer purge stream 101 where recovery of a mother liquor<br>
147 and wash filtrate 148 comprising a metal catalyst is needed.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In one embodiment of this invention, a process to remove impurities<br>
and to recover a mother liquor 147 and a wash filtrate 148 from an oxidizer<br>
purge stream 101 is provided as shown in Figures 1 though 4. Common<br>
numbers within the Figures indicate the same process stream. The process<br>
comprises the following steps.<br>
The oxidizer purge stream 101 is withdrawn from a carboxylic acid<br>
oxidative synthesis process. The oxidizer purge stream 101 serves as the<br>
feed stream to the present process. The oxidizer purge stream 101<br>
comprises carboxylic acid, water, a solvent, metal catalyst and at least one<br>
impurity. The impurity comprises at least one selected from the group<br>
consisting of organic bromides, corrosion metals, p-xylene oxidation byproducts,<br>
and impurities derived as a result of impurities in the p-xylene.<br>
The organic bromides may be used as promoters in the oxidation reaction.<br>
Examples of corrosion metals are iron and chromium compounds, which<br>
inhibit, reduce or entirely destroy the activity of the metal catalyst. Aside<br>
from the catalyst and promoter, the oxidizer mother liquor stream 415 also<br>
contains by-products and impurities. These by-products and impurities arise<br>
partially from minor impurities present in the p-xylene feed stream. Other<br>
impurities arise due to the incomplete oxidation of p-xylene resulting in<br>
partially oxidized products. Still other by-products result from competing<br>
side reactions in the oxidation of p-xylene to terephthalic acid.<br>
Carboxylic acids include aromatic carboxylic acids produced via<br>
controlled oxidation of an organic substrate. Such aromatic carboxylic acids<br>
include compounds with at least one carboxylic acid group attached to a<br>
carbon atom that is part of an aromatic ring, preferably having at least 6<br>
carbon atoms, even more preferably having only carbon atoms. Suitable<br>
examples of such aromatic rings include, but are not limited to, benzene,<br>
biphenyl, terphenyl, naphthalene, and other carbon-based fused aromatic<br>
rings. Examples of suitable carboxylic acids include, but are not limited to,<br>
terephthalic acid, benzole acid, p-toluic acid, isophthalic acid, trimellitic acid,<br>
naphthalene dicarboxylic acid, 2,5-diphenyl-terephthalic acid and mixtures<br>
thereof.<br>
Suitable solvents include, but are not limited to, aliphatic monocarboxylic<br>
acids, preferably containing 2 to about 6 carbon atoms, or<br>
benzoic acid and mixtures thereof and mixtures of these compounds with<br>
water. Preferably, the solvent is acetic acid mixed with water, in a ratio of<br>
about 5:1 to about 25:1, preferably between about 8:1 and about 20:1.<br>
Throughout the specification, acetic acid will be referred to as the solvent.<br>
However, it should be appreciated that other suitable solvents, such as<br>
those disclosed previously, may also be utilized.<br>
Step (a) comprises routing an oxidizer purge stream 101 to a solids<br>
enrichment zone 140 to form a purge slurry 110.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the solids enrichment zone 140<br>
comprises a vessel suitable to allow cooling of the oxidizer purge stream<br>
101 to produce the purge slurry 110. There are no particular requirements<br>
for this vessel other than it allows enough residence time to cool the<br>
oxidizer purge stream 101 to the desired temperature to produce the purge<br>
slurry 110. This can be accomplished by, for example, using an agitated<br>
vessel comprising cooling coils, or utilizing various heat exchangers known<br>
in the art. The solids enrichment zone 140 can comprise any device known<br>
in the art sufficient to cool the oxidizer purge stream 101 sufficiently to<br>
produce a purge slurry 110 wherein the oxidizer purge stream 101 has<br>
been cooled from at least 5°C to at least 90°C. The amount of cooling will<br>
depend on the amount of precipitation that is desired. For example, the<br>
cooling of the oxidizer purge stream 101 can be at least 5°C which is the<br>
difference in the temperature in Celsius between the oxidizer purge stream<br>
101 and the purge slurry 110. Another range could be at least 10°C, at<br>
least 15°C, at least 20°C, at least 25°C, at least 30°C, at least 35°C, at least<br>
40°C, at least 45°C, at least 50°C, at least 55°C, at least 60°C, at least<br>
65°C, at least 70°C, at least 75°C, at least 80°C, at least 85°C, and at least<br>
90°C. In another embodiment of the invention, the oxidizer purge stream<br>
101 is at a temperature of about 80°C to about 150°C. Another range is<br>
about 80°C to about 140°C, and another range is about 85°C to about<br>
100°C.<br>
In another embodiment the oxidizer purge stream 101 is charged to<br>
a solids enrichment zone 140 to cause solids to precipitate. The<br>
precipitation can be accomplished by any means known in the art. For<br>
example, one method is the addition of a precipitant agent stream 105 to<br>
the oxidizer purge. The precipitant agent 105 is charged to the solids<br>
enrichment zone 140 and causes precipitation of solids from the oxidizer<br>
purge stream 101. The precipitant agent 105 comprises any compound<br>
suitable to precipitate solids from the oxidizer purge stream 101. Suitable<br>
compounds include, but are not limited to, water, methanol, isopropanol, nbutanol,<br>
paraxylene, and isobutanol.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention for step (a) the oxidizer<br>
purge stream 101 can be concentrated by the removal of acetic acid. The<br>
concentration can be accomplished by any means known in the art. This<br>
can be accomplished by boiling away acetic acid to the extent that there is<br>
insufficient acetic acid solvent to keep the solute solids in solution. Another<br>
method of solvent removal is the use of a cross flow membrane system that<br>
allows acetic acid to cross the membrane as permeate resulting in a<br>
concentrate retentate.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention for step (a) solids can be<br>
generated in the solids enrichment zone by any combination of cooling,<br>
removal of solvent and precipitant agent addition.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention the amount of solid in the<br>
solid(s) enrichment process can result in the purge slurry 110 having at<br>
least 1% by weight solids to at least 30% by weight solids. Another range is<br>
at least 1% by weight solids to at least 25% by weight solids, and another<br>
range is at least 1% by weight solids to at least 20% by weight solids. The<br>
solids enrichment can be accomplished by the cooling process described<br>
previously or in another embodiment of the invention, the purge slurry 110<br>
can be produced from the oxidizer purge stream 101 though the use of<br>
evaporation of the solvent. Fox example, in another embodiment of the<br>
invention the solids enrich zone comprises an evaporator that could be<br>
used to evaporate the solvent. The evaporator can be an evaporator such<br>
as the one use in U.S patent #4,939,297, or in U.S patent applications<br>
10/455,016, 10/455,018 and 10/874,419 all of these are herein incorporated<br>
by reference to the extent they do not contradict statements made herein.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, any means known in the art can be<br>
used so long as the desired content of solids in the purge slurry 110 is<br>
obtained.<br>
Step (b) comprises separating the purge slurry 110 in a separation<br>
zone 151 to form a filter cake 154 and a mother liquor 147; and<br>
washing the filter cake 154 with a wash feed 149 in the separation zone 151<br>
to form a washed cake 146 and a wash filtrate 148; and optionally<br>
dewatering the washed cake 146 in the separation zone 151 to form a<br>
dewatered cake 159; wherein the separation zone 151 comprises at least<br>
one pressure filtration device;<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the purge slurry 110 is<br>
introduced in the separation zone 151 wherein the separation zone<br>
comprises a filtration zone 153, a washing zone 155, and optionally a drying<br>
zone 157 as shown in Figure 3. The filtration zone 153 comprises a filter<br>
cell, or a series of filter cells, physically situated to permit a filter cake 154 to<br>
develop a distribution across the area of the filter cell to hinder or prevent<br>
the channeling of wash feed 149 through the filter cake 154.<br>
A filter cake 154 of at least 0.25 inch in depth to about 8 inches in<br>
depth, preferably at least 0.5 inch in depth, more preferably at least 1 inch<br>
in depth, and even more preferably about 2 to about 4 inches in depth is<br>
distributed over the area of the filter cell. The washed cake, 146, can be<br>
recovered or further treated, recycled and/or sent to waste treatment<br>
facilities.<br>
Upon obtaining a suitable or preferred height of filter cake 154, about<br>
0.5 inch to about 4 inches, the filter cake 154 leaves the filtration zone 153<br>
which comprises a filter or series of filters and enters a washing zone 155<br>
where the filter cake 154 is contacted with a wash feed 149. There is<br>
sufficient pressure across the filter cake 154 to allow a reservoir or buildup<br>
of the wash feed 149 over the filter cake 154 to a suitable depth, preferably<br>
to a minimum depth of 0.25 inch. A pressure gradient of at least 0.5 psi,<br>
preferably from about 5 psi to about 65 psi, across the filter cake 154 and<br>
the reservoir of wash feed 149 can be applied to displace any solute in the<br>
filter cake 154 with wash feed 149.<br>
A filter cake 154 depth of at least 0.5 inches is suitable to obtain a<br>
filter cake 154 of sufficient compactness from which a wash filtrate 148<br>
containing a solute from the filter cake 154 can be removed efficiently by<br>
displacement washing. If the filter cake depth 154 is less than about 0.25<br>
inch, channeling of wash feed 149 in the filter cake 154 can occur resulting<br>
in non-uniform washing of the filter cake 154.<br>
Because of the loss of efficiency in displacement washing of the filter<br>
cake 154, a minimum filter cake 154 depth of at least 0,25 inch, of purified<br>
terephthalic acid is preferred.<br>
A minimum liquid height above the filter cake 154 surface is required<br>
to ensure that displacement washing occurs. This height must be sufficient<br>
to ensure that the filter cake 154 surface is completely covered with wash<br>
feed 149. If the filter cake 154 surface is not covered with wash feed 149,<br>
bypassing of the wash feed 149 can occur without adequate displacement<br>
of the solute in the filter cake 154. Because of irregularities in the filter cake<br>
154 surface, a minimum liquid height of about 0.25 inch is preferred above<br>
the filter cake 154 surface.<br>
It has been found that displacement of the solute from the filter cake<br>
154 using the wash feed 149 at high pressure permits an efficient<br>
separation of catalyst metals from the filter cake 154. Another benefit of the<br>
high pressure is the reduction of wash feed 149 required to recover cobalt<br>
as shown in the examples.<br>
Utilization of added stages in the separation zone 151 can decrease<br>
the amount of wash feed 149 required to reduce the total amount of metal<br>
catalyst retained in the filter cake 154. It is convenient therefore that a<br>
suitable number of stages of positive displacement washing be used to<br>
minimize total wash feed 149 used in displacement washing to reduce need<br>
for downstream waste treatment facilities.<br>
It is understood that multiple stages of the displacement washing<br>
procedure can replace a single stage displacement washing procedure<br>
wherein the quantity of wash feed 149 is sufficient to obtain at least 80%<br>
recovery of the metal catalyst from the purge slurry 110 to the mother liquor<br>
147 and the wash filtrate 148. Additionally, a procedure utilizing multiple<br>
stages of counter-current washing can be useful if reduction of the amount<br>
of wash feed 149 is determined to be advantageous.<br>
In the process of the instant invention, a purge slurry 110 is<br>
introduced into one or more of a series of filter cells physically situated to<br>
permit a filter cake 154 of requisite thickness to develop.<br>
Upon obtaining a minimum height of filter cake 154, about 0.25 to<br>
about 4 inches, the filter cake 154 leaves the filter or series of filters and<br>
enters a washing zone 155 where the filter cake 154 is washed with a wash<br>
feed 149. Pressure can then be applied to the wash feed 149 to displace<br>
the solute (i.e. the liquid and any dissolved compounds such as metal<br>
catalyst in the filter cake) of the filter cake 154. Upon displacement of the<br>
solute with the wash feed, the filter cake 154 can be discharged from the<br>
filtration zone 155 by any suitable means and the cycle repeated. In an<br>
embodiment of the invention the ratio of wash feed 149 to filter cake 154<br>
discharge is within the range of from about 1:20 to about 20:1 to reduce the<br>
level of metal catalyst in the filter cake by greater than 95%.<br>
Equipment for performing the requisite washing cycle can comprise a<br>
series of filter cells maintained in a suitable position to permit a wash feed<br>
149 flood to develop over the filter cells. In one embodiment of the<br>
invention, suitable equipment can comprise a rotary drum pressure filter<br>
with multiple filter cells, fitted with a means for discharging washed cake<br>
146 from the filter cells. The filter cake 154 can be washed for as many<br>
times as required to develop a minimum concentration of metal catalyst in<br>
the washed cake 146 before discharging the washed cake 146 from the<br>
rotary drum filter.<br>
A suitable pressure filter which can be adapted to the requirements<br>
of the instant invented process is a BHS-FEST™ rotary drum pressure filter,<br>
BHS-WERK, Sonthofen, D-8972, Sonthofen, West Germany, although<br>
other pressure filters which can accomplish the required operation can be<br>
used. Examples of other devices that can used in the solid-liquid separation<br>
zone 151 include, but are not limited to, pressure belt filters, filter presses,<br>
centrifuges, and pressure leaf filters. The pressure filter can be operated at<br>
a temperature and pressure sufficient to obtain at least 80% recovery of the<br>
metal catalyst from the solute of the mother liquor 147. Preferably, the<br>
pressure filter can be operated at a temperature of about 25°C to about 160<br>
°C, and a pressure of 1 atmospheres to 50 atmospheres.<br>
In the operation of the BHS-FEST™ filter as shown in Figure 4, a<br>
rotary drum contains a series of filter cells located on the periphery of the<br>
rotating drum. As the drum rotates, the filter cells receive a purge slurry 110<br>
and a filter cake 154 builds to a requisite depth. The mother liquor 147 is<br>
produced by filtration of the purge slurry 110. Upon rotation of the drum,<br>
the filter cake 154 enters a washing zone 155 where reservoir of wash feed<br>
149 is built up over the filter cake 154 to a required depth. The applied<br>
pressure to the wash feed 149 reservoir forces the fluid through the filter<br>
cake 154 to displace the residual mother liquor to produce a washed cake<br>
146. Upon further rotation of the drum, the wash cycle can be repeated at<br>
least three more times if necessary in a counter current fashion, after which<br>
the system pressure is released with attendant temperature decrease to an<br>
ambient conditions. Optionally, the washed cake 146 can be dewatered in a<br>
dewatering zone 157 with a vapor via conduit 152 to produce a dewatered<br>
cake 159 and a humid vapor 160. The resultant dewatered cake 159 can<br>
then be discharged from the drum by any conventional means.<br>
Figure 4 illustrates an embodiment of the invention where a rotary<br>
pressure drum filter is utilized as the process filtration device. The rotary<br>
drum pressure filter comprises a filtration zone 153, a wash zone 155,<br>
optionally, a dewatering zone 157, a discharge zone 164 and a cloth wash<br>
zone 162. The cloth wash zone 164 shown in figure 4 is an embodiment of<br>
the invention where the rotary pressure drum filter comprises a cloth wash<br>
zone 162 where the filters are washed after discharge of the dewatered<br>
cake 159.<br>
The wash filtrate 148 is produced by displacement washing the filter<br>
cake with the wash feed 149. The filter cake 154 within the separation zone<br>
151 undergoes extraction of metal catalyst by introduction of the wash feed<br>
149 to form the wash filtrate 148 wherein in an embodiment of the invention<br>
at least 80% of the metal catalyst is recovered in the wash filtrate and the<br>
mother liquor 147. In an embodiment of the invention, at least 90% of the<br>
metal catalyst is recovered in the wash filtrate 148 and the mother liquor<br>
147. The mother liquor 147 and the wash filtrate 148 can optionally be<br>
combined before exiting the solid-liquid separation zone 151.<br>
The wash feed 149 comprises water and optionally an additional<br>
solvent. In another embodiment of the invention the wash feed 149<br>
comprises at least one solvent.<br>
Perhaps most surprisingly, is that by utilizing water as a wash feed<br>
149 at temperatures in the range of about 20°C to about 70°C, preferably<br>
about 30°C to about 50° C, sufficient corrosion metal is retained in the<br>
dewatered cake 159 wherein the need for corrosion metal removal by other<br>
means is eliminated. The dewatered cake 159 which represents solids<br>
stripped of metal catalyst can be disposed from the system.<br>
It should be noted that one embodiment of the invention utilizing a<br>
rotary pressure drum filter the separation zone 151 can comprises any<br>
device known in the art sufficient to produce a mother liquor 147 and wash<br>
filtrate 148 from the purge slurry 110. For example such devices can<br>
include but are not limited to a centrifuge, decanter centrifuge, stack disk<br>
centrifuge, pressure filters such as candle filters, leaf filters, filter press and<br>
the like.<br>
Step (c) comprises routing at least a portion of the wash filtrate<br>
and/or at least a portion of the mother liquor to an oxidation zone.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention at least a portion of the mother<br>
liquor 147 and/or at least a portion of the wash filtrate 148 in step (e) can be<br>
recycled back to the oxidation zone 400 comprising at least one oxidation<br>
reactor in a terephthalic acid process, such as, but not limited to, the<br>
process described in figure 1. At least a portion can be any amount greater<br>
than 1 % by weight. In another range, at least a portion can be any amount<br>
greater than 25 % by weight. In another range, at least a portion can be<br>
any amount greater than 50 % by weight. In another range, at least a<br>
portion can be any amount greater than 75 % by weight. In another range,<br>
at least a portion can be 100 % by weight. Conduits 152 and 153 represent<br>
the portion, if any, of mother liquor 147 and wash filtrate 148 respectfully<br>
that is not recycled back to the oxidation zone 400. These streams can be<br>
used in other processes or disposed of through incineration or any other<br>
means known in the art.<br><br><br><br><br>
