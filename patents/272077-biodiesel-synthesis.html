				<td>BIODIESEL SYNTHESIS<br>
The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for the synthesis of<br>
biodiesel and a ship comprising apparatus for the synthesis of biodiesel.<br>
Biodiesel is manufactured by transesterification of animal or vegetable oils/fats.<br>
Such oils and fats comprise triglyceride esters containing long chain fatty acid moieties.<br>
In biodiesel synthesis, such triglycerides are transesterified with short chain alcohols,<br>
typically methanol and sometimes ethanol though other alcohols have been used. The<br>
reaction can be carried out in the presence of an acidic or basic catalyst and in general<br>
the basic catalysts are faster, with sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide being the<br>
most common. Typically, sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide with relatively low<br>
water level (particularly in powder or pellet form) is mixed with the alcohol, for<br>
example methanol, and then mixed with the oil.<br>
For the commercial production of biodiesel, it is desirable to reach a<br>
relatively high degree of conversion of glyceride ester into biodiesel (preferably 96.5%<br>
or above) within a reasonable time period. In the past, it has been found that the time<br>
required to reach such a high level of conversion is comparatively long.<br>
A problem has been encountered that basic methanol and oil do not mix very<br>
well, because of their different densities and because of the coalescing nature of their<br>
respective phases.<br>
Conventional approaches to improving the overall kinetics having included<br>
raising the temperature, and applying large degree of shear by agitation.<br>
For example, in the past, the transesterification reaction has been carried out in<br>
batch reactors provided with stirrers. Whilst reasonable results have been obtained with<br><br>
such reactors, for large scale industrial processing, a continuous system is preferred,<br>
rather than a batch process.<br>
A pipe reactor is a suitable design of continuous reactor for the manufacture of<br>
biodiesel.<br>
Various devices have been used in pipe reactors for providing high shear, but<br>
many of these (for example jets, mechanical mixers, oscillating flow) require high-<br>
energy input levels, which are expensive to run or involve relatively sensitive<br>
equipment. In many cases, high degrees of conversion are still not reached in a<br>
practical time span.<br>
W099/26913 discloses a method for production of fatty acid methyl ester in<br>
which a static mixer is used which creates high or powerful turbulence. There is a<br>
substantial pressure drop across the static mixer. This requires very high pressures to<br>
operate, which is uneconomic.<br>
The present invention sets out to overcome the problems of the prior art.<br>
The inventors have realised that the transesterification reaction itself is quite fast<br>
(that is, it has a high rate constant) and that the time required to reach the desired level<br>
of completion is limited not by the rate constant itself, nor simply by steric factors<br>
(reaction surface area of droplets) but by mass transfer factors and stoichiometric<br>
factors.<br>
Mass transfer factors can be explained by considering a droplet of basic methanol<br>
surrounded by triglyceride at a temperature, for example around 60 °C. Reaction on the<br>
surface of the droplets would take place very quickly creating a layer of methyl ester<br>
(biodiesel) and glycerine, mono and di glycerides. There would result a sea of<br>
triglycerides surrounding a methyl ester (outside layer), glycerine, mono and di<br>
glycerides (middle layer) and basic methanol droplet (central core). For the reaction to<br>
continue the methyl ester will have to diffuse into the surrounding triglycerides and the<br>
glycerine would have to be diluted continuously by the basic methanol from within the<br><br>
droplet's reducing core. Accordingly the reaction becomes limited by the rate of<br>
diffusion of reactants and reaction products, even though the mono and di giycerides<br>
possess surfactant nature. This limitation becomes even more evident within<br>
approximately the last quarter of the reaction, after for example 75% of the ester has<br>
been created, when the percentage of glycerine within close proximity of the<br>
concentrated basic methanol droplets excessively reduces the reaction rate, thereby<br>
making the final quarter of the reaction take longer than the previous three quarters by a<br>
significant factor. Methanol is highly soluble in glycerol. This effect has been<br>
overcome m the prior art by removing glycerine at this stage, through a separation<br>
process. As the removed glycerine holds the bulk of the original added basic methanol,<br>
a second injection and mixing process of basic methanol is required to complete the<br>
reaction, after which another glycerine removal step is required. Also, after the initial<br>
methanol injection and prior to the first stage glycerine removal, a significant proportion<br>
of mono and di giycerides are present, increasing the propensity for the methyl ester to<br>
dissolve in the glycerine and be removed. This biodiesel, if not extracted by another<br>
process, significantly reduces the overall process yield.<br>
Accordmgly, there is a problem that a two stage glycerine removal process<br>
creates significant delay, complexity and inefficiency in the process.<br>
Elsewhere in the prior art, a single methanol injection is envisaged, which, if<br>
provided at sufficient proportions can complete the reaction to beyond 96.5% ester<br>
conversion in one step. In general, the process parameters which lead to such high<br>
levels of conversion are not explained and not widely vmderstood. Further, some prior<br>
art processes reach the required result by using methanol in very high excess, such as<br>
one- to-one by volume, which afterwards necessitates extremely expensive methanol<br>
recovery distillation. The inventors have realised that to minimise process steps,<br>
optimise methanol usage and recovery in relation to the whole process economics and<br>
maximise catalyst efficiencies, thereby reducing the burden on down-stream catalyst<br>
removal stages, it is necessary to maintain a certain level of turbulence within the<br>
reactor for the last one quarter to one third of the reactor residence tune or length (if<br>
uniform in crossectional area). This final stage mixing overcomes mass transfer<br><br>
problems created and exacerbated by the generation of the inherently inert glycerine and<br>
shortens the final stage of conversion to seconds rather than minutes or hours<br>
When considering stoichiometric factors, the position of the equilibrium<br>
between the glyceride ester and the short chain alcohol ester (the biodiesel) is<br>
determined by the relative quantity of oil and short chain alcohol. In a continuous<br>
reaction in a pipe reactor, different stages in the pipe reactor represent different stages in<br>
the progress of the reaction. Later stages have lower quantities of short chain alcohol<br>
and oil. The inventors have realised that if the reaction volume from a later part of the<br>
reaction is mixed by backflow with the reaction volume from an earlier part of the<br>
reaction (an upstream part of the pipe reactor), the reactants may be diluted with<br>
reaction products (glycerol and short chain alcohol ester) which can adversely affect the<br>
position of the equilibrium and the rate at which it is achieved.<br>
Further, if there is a high level of mixing of reactants from different stages in the<br>
process, there is a risk that some part of the reaction volume will effectively pass<br>
through the reactor before it has had time to react completely, again, adversely affecting<br>
the total degree of conversion of oil to methyl ester.<br>
The present invention in particular sets out to provide a continuous process for<br>
the reaction of natural oil with short chain alcohol in the presence of alkaline catalyst in<br>
which a high degree of conversion can be obtained in a reasonable time.<br>
The present invention is based on the understanding of the reaction kinetics<br>
described above which has been discovered by the inventors. In particular, the present<br>
invention set out to achieve an optimum mixing regime which enhances mass transfer of<br>
reactants without introducing the problems of back-mixing described above. It is also<br>
desired to avoid the use of excessively high pressure drops across the reactor. The<br>
inventors have realised that the degree of mixing normal to the flow direction should be<br>
greater than the degree of mixing parallel to the flow direction. Similarly, the present<br><br>
inventors have discovered that the time taken for elements of the fluid to pass through<br>
the reactor should be within a certain range of the residence time.<br>
The present invention provides a method of reacting a natural oil with a short<br>
chain alcohol in the presence of alkaline catalyst, in which a mixture of natural oil, short<br>
chain alcohol and alkaline catalyst is fed in one direction along a pipe reactor under<br>
transitional or turbulent conditions, so that the reactants are mixed in a direction normal<br>
to the flow direction to a greater degree than in a direction parallel to the flow direction<br>
or so that the reactants are mixed in a direction normal to the flow direction such that<br>
the time taken for 90 % of the elements of fluid to pass through the reactor is within<br>
20% of the mean residence time of reactant in the reactor.<br>
The present invention further provides an apparatus for carrying out the method<br>
of the invention.<br>
The apparatus of the present invention comprises a pipe reactor, a feed of natural<br>
oil, a feed of short chain alcohol and a feed of alkaline catalyst, the feed bemg arranged<br>
to feed the reactants in one direction along the pipe reactor, a turbulence generator being<br>
provided so that the reactants are fed in transitional or turbulent conditions, so that<br>
reactants are mixed in a direction normal to the flow direction to a greater degree than in<br>
a direction parallel to the flow direction or so that the reactants are mixed in a direction<br>
normal to the flow direction such the time taken for 90% of the elements of fluid to pass<br>
through the reactor is within 20% of the mean residence time of reactant in the reactor.<br>
The present inventors have further realised that, because a large amount of the<br>
raw material for biofuel generation is grown in one country and then shipped to another<br>
country, the raw material spends a large amount of time on board ship. The inventors<br>
have realised that this time can be used for converting the raw material into biodiesel.<br>
This use of highly compact and intense biodiesel reactor systems on board ship reduces<br>
the total time reqmred for conversion from crop to finished product as the delivery time<br>
is used to process the oil into biodiesel and the biodiesel can be then delivered directly<br>
to existing infrastructure in the importing country such as dock or port based refineries<br>
and or tank storage facilities. This allows feedstock to be imported and processed from<br><br>
the tropics or other regions where strong sun light is encountered so world wide<br>
feedstock can be economically and renewable accessed by the high use population<br>
within the developed and developing worlds.<br>
Other benefits in shifting the process plant to on board the ship is that the methanol<br>
required to process the oil during the ship's travel back from collecting the oil can be<br>
collected from the refineries where the biodiesel is delivered, as it will tend to be either<br>
stored within these facilities in significant quantities or made there during other refining<br>
processes, using methane gas.<br>
Benefits and technologies that have been developed for exploiting oil and gas reserves<br>
from regions where the quantities available do not justify the building of wharfs, piers<br>
and other extremely expensive conventional port system can also be used. These<br>
including rotationally calm buoy systems that act as offshore unloading stations whilst<br>
being permanently moored to the sea bed and connected to a suitable oil production<br>
facility on land. Such systems can be used to offload natural oil to awaiting ships for<br>
either transport to importing coutries for land based processing or transport and<br>
processing on process plant onboard the ships.<br>
This concept of utilising low cost shore access system allows significant areas of the<br>
world to be considered for cultivation for renewable feedstock plants by removing one<br>
of the main hurdles from the economic equation, being " how far from conventional<br>
transport infrastructure is the feedstock located."<br>
Other benefits of the ship based process facility are;<br>
•	biodiesel plant could be brought into port to provide capacity or increase existing<br>
capacity any where within the world at very short notice if the ship already exists.<br>
•	This concept allows plant including its own primary tank farm storage to be built in<br>
low cost locations and delivered quickly to site reducing time to market and<br>
associated time constraint and regulatory and land costs.<br>
•	Biodiesel processing ships could be rotationally turret moored or spread moored just<br>
off shore from the feedstock export port providing a semi permanent floating<br>
production and storage facility for virgin oil and fat storage and processing, and<br><br>
final biodiesel storage and off-loading to delivery ships through stem to bow or side<br>
to side tethering and offloading arrangements.<br>
Accordingly, in a second aspect, the present invention provides a ship,<br>
comprising means for storing a raw material used in the synthesis of biodiesel, a plant<br>
for synthesising biodiesel and means for storing the biodiesel synthesised.<br>
The present inventors have further realised that many of the areas of the world<br>
suitable for raising animals or growing crops which can be used as a source of fats and<br>
oils are not conveniently located for deep harbours suitable for berthing tankers or ships<br>
according to the second aspect of the invention. The present inventors have realised<br>
that harbourless liquid loading systems for ships, for example catenary anchor leg<br>
mooring buoys (CALM buoys) may be used to load natural oils and fats for biodiesel<br>
synthesis in such conditions.<br>
Accordingly, in a third aspect of the invention, there is provided a system for<br>
loading biodiesel or oils and fats suitable for the synthesis of biodiesel, from land to<br>
ships, comprising land based storage containing biodiesel or natural fats and oils for the<br>
synthesis of biodiesel, and at least one pipeline leading from the storage to a floating<br>
loading point, fixed in water of depth sufficient to permit ships to dock with or lie<br>
adjacent to the floating loading point and means for feeding biodiesel, oil or fat from the<br>
pipelme at the floating loading point to a ship. Preferably the floating loadmg pomt is a<br>
CALM buoy.<br>
Preferred and optional features of the present invention will be described further<br>
below.<br>
Reactants<br>
The natural oils used in the present invention may comprise fats, oils or mixtures<br>
thereof obtained from natural sources such as animal or vegetable sources<br><br>
Such fats and oils comprise triglyceride esters having at least one relatively long<br>
chain carboxylate moiety (for example, having from 12 to 22 carbon atoms). Such<br>
materials are very well known to the person skilled in the art.<br>
The natural oils may have been treated by any suitable pre-treatment process, for<br>
example de-gumming, and removal or conversion of components which would interfere<br>
with the transesterification process, for example free fatty acid.<br>
The short chain alcohol may comprise any suitable short chain alcohol, for<br>
example a C1-C4 alcohol, straight or (where appropriate) branched. Preferably, it is<br>
methanol or ethanol, most preferably methanol.<br>
The alkaline catalyst preferably comprises potassium hydroxide or sodium<br>
hydroxide, or sodium or potassium methoxide. The alkaline catalyst may be supplied in<br>
powder or pellet form.<br>
The relative quantities of the reactants can be at any suitable level. Preferably,<br>
the ratio by mass of short chain alcohol to natural oil is in the range 1:3 to 1:10, more<br>
preferably 1:3 to 1:6, most preferably in the range 1:4 to 1:5.<br>
The ratio by mass of alkaline catalyst to natural oil is suitably in the range<br>
0.001:1 to 0.02: 1, preferably 0.003:1 to 0.006:1.<br>
Preferably, the alkaline catalyst and the short chain alcohol are mixed before<br>
being mixed with the natural oil.<br>
A pre-prepared mixture of alkaline catalyst and alcohol may be obtained, for<br>
example prepared at another site.<br>
The feeds for the reactants may comprise any suitable feeds, for example they<br>
may comprise pumps. They may comprise storage means such as tanks. The feed for<br>
alkaline catalyst and the feed for alcohol may comprise the same feed. Preferably, the<br>
natural oil, the short chain alcohol and the alkaline catalyst are mixed upstream of the<br>
pipe reactor.<br><br>
Preferably, the flow of mixed natural oil, short chain alcohol and alkaline<br>
catalyst is turbulent when it enters the pipe reactor.<br>
Turbulence may be generated by injecting a flow of short chain alcohol,<br>
optionally with alkaline catalyst dissolved therein, into a flow of natural oil, preferably<br>
at an angle (preferably a right angle) to the direction of flow of the natural oil.<br>
Means may be provided for heating the natural oil before it is mixed with the<br>
alkaline catalyst and short chain alcohol.<br>
The temperature in the pipe reactor is preferably raised above ambient<br>
temperature. Preferably, it is in the range 40-130°C.<br>
Pipe Reactor - design and conditions<br>
The pipe reactor may comprise any suitable design of reactor. It should have an<br>
inflow end and an outflow end, a flow direction being defined from the inflow end to<br>
the outflow end.<br>
The reactor may have any suitable internal configuration. Preferably, it is<br>
substantially parallel sided, though the flow cross section may vary across the length of<br>
the pipe reactor. Means may be provided for heating or cooling the pipe reactor.<br>
The pipe reactor may have a diameter in the range 2-200mm. Preferably the<br>
diameter is 6mm or more, because it is easier to establish turbulent or turbulent/laminar.<br>
flow. At very small reactor diameters, the flow tends to be laminar, unless very high<br>
flow velocities are used, which can require high pressure and high energy inputs.<br>
The pipe reactor can be constructed as single length of pipe or a plurality of<br>
lengths of pipe connected together. It may have a substantially straight configuration or<br><br>
it may be curved. It may comprise bends or turns. A plurality of straight pipe sections<br>
connected by U-bends may be provided, to provide a compact structure. The pipe<br>
reactor may comprise a plurality of substantially straight pipe sections connected by<br>
headers. The straight line pipe sections may be contained within a single structure, for<br>
example an insulated structure or a vessel for containing heated fluid for heating the<br>
pipe reactor.<br>
In the present invention, substantially all of the oil is converted to a short chain<br>
alcohol ester in a single pass through the pipe reactor.<br>
Where the pipe reactor passes through a heat exchanger, it may be the same heat<br>
exchanger as is used to initially heat the oil before the oil is fed into the pipe reactor.<br>
The total length of the pipe reactor should be sufficient to achieve the desired<br>
degree of conversion of natural oil to triglyceride. The length is suitably in the range 30<br>
to 100 metres, preferably 40 to 100 metres depending upon the capacity range required.<br>
Preferably, the production capacity is in the range 50-200 tonnes per day.<br>
The reactants flow through the reactor in one direction in the sense that the flow<br>
is not an oscillating flow. That is, steps are not taken to actively cause the flow to<br>
change direction. The flow direction referred to here is the bulk flow direction. In the<br>
apparatus of the invention, a pump or pumps may be provided for driving flow through<br>
the reactor, the pumps being normally operated in one direction.<br>
The reactants are preferably fed through the reactor at a linear bulk flow speed<br>
which is greater than 0.25m/s and preferably less than 100m/s. The speed should be<br>
sufficient that the flow is either turbulent or at the turbulent/laminar flow transition.<br>
The person skilled in the art would be able to determine whether the flow within<br>
the pipe reactor is laminar, turbulent or at the turbulent/laminar flow transition.<br>
The reactants are preferably under a pressure in excess of 0.5 bar gauge, more<br>
preferably in the range 1-30 bar gauge. Pressures in the range 20-25 bar can be used to<br><br>
maximise feedstock flexibility and any spare pressure head after the pipe reactor stage<br>
can be recycled.<br>
Preferably, the pressure drop across the pipe reactor from inflow to outflow end<br>
is in the range 0.1 bar - 10 bar, more preferably 0.5 bar - 58 bar, most preferably in the<br>
range 3- 7 bar.<br>
Control of Mixing<br>
As noted above, the present invention provides a method and apparatus in which<br>
the mixing is controlled so that mass transfer is enhanced without introducing undesired<br>
back mixing.<br>
The control of mixing will be described in terms of four parameters:<br>
1.	time taken for elements of fluid to pass through the reactor compared to<br>
the mean residence time (also called residence time distribution);<br>
2.	Maintenance of conditions near plug flow,<br>
3.	Reynolds number and energy input;<br>
4.	design of mixing elements in the pipe reactor.<br>
1. Time taken for elements of fluid to pass through the reactor<br>
According to one aspect of the present invention, the time taken for 90% of the<br>
elements of fluid to pass through the reactor is within 20% of the mean residence time<br>
of reactant in the reactor.<br>
Preferably, the time taken for 90 % of the elements of fluid to pass through the<br>
reactor is within 15%, preferably within 10% of the mean residence time of reactant in<br>
the reactor. The skilled person will be aware as part of their common general<br>
knowledge how to determine mean residence time and the distribution of time taken for<br>
elements of fluid to pass through the reactor. However, the following method of<br>
measuring this parameter may be used.<br><br>
Two electrical conductivity measuring devices are provided. One is provided in<br>
a pipe just before the inlet to the pipe reactor. The second is provided in a pipe leading<br>
from the outlet of the pipe reactor. To measure the residence time distribution, a stable<br>
flow of reactants is established within the pipe reactor.<br>
The pipe reactor is provided with injection means for injecting a test volume into<br>
the flow through the pipe reactor.<br>
A test volume comprising reactants which have been well mixed, for example by<br>
passing them through a separate pipe section comprising at least one static mixer<br>
element, is injected within a periodO.05 - 2 seconds .<br>
The quantity of the test volume is such that the test volume extends across the<br>
entire width of the pipe reactor normal to the bulk flow direction. After a time t=0, the<br>
test volume passes the first conductivity probe. After a period t = r, the test volume<br>
passes the second conductivity probe. The time r is defined as the residence time.<br>
As the test volume passes the first conductivity probe, the variation of<br>
conductivity over time is obtained, to obtain a peak, the shape of which is recorded. As<br>
the test volume passes the second conductivity probe, the variation of conductivity over<br>
time is measured, to obtain a second peak, the shape of the second peak being recorded.<br>
The shape of the first peak is subtracted using a suitable mathematical process from the<br>
shape of the second peak. As a result, a peak form is obtained which represents the<br>
dispersion of the residence time. The residence time distribution at a certain portion of<br>
the peak can then be measured.<br>
The method of mathematical subtraction is generally known as deconvolution and is<br>
used mainly to separate overlapping peaks in spectral data. In the present invention, this<br>
process may be used to remove the dispersion (width) of one peak from another using a<br>
simple Fourier transform (for example, the Fourier system provided by Excel TM).<br>
Maintenance of conditions near Plug flow<br><br>
The present invention preferably uses conditions which approximate to plug flow in the<br>
pipe reactor, which may be called 'near plug flow' conditions. This is referred to below<br>
as 'plug flow maintenance'.<br>
Preferably, plug flow maintenance is 80% or more.<br>
"Plug flow maintenance' as used herein is defined by the following test.<br>
Plug flow maintenance is measured between two defmed points. Preferably the<br>
defmed points are substantially near the inflow end and near the outflow end of the pipe<br>
reactor. They may be located just outside the pipe reactor.<br>
The pipe reactor is provided with electrical conductivity measuring devices at<br>
the defined points. The length between the conductivity meters is preferably at least in<br>
the range 100 to 110% of the length of the pipe reactor.<br>
To measure plug flow maintenance, a stable flow of reactants is preferably first<br>
established within the pipe reactor.<br>
At time defined as t = 0, a measured dose of one molar salt (sodium chloride)<br>
solution is injected into the flow. The quantity of salt solution injected is preferably<br>
such that it is sufficient to define a lamina of relatively narrow thickness (preferably<br>
about 1cm), preferably extending in the direction normal to the flow direction across the<br>
whole width of the pipe reactor.<br>
The width of the lamina of salt solution at the first defined point is measured by<br>
measuring the conductivity output from the first conductivity meter. The fill width at<br>
half maximum of the conductivity peak is measured.<br>
The width of the lamina at the second defined point is then measured by<br>
measuring the conductivity from the second conductivity meter. The full width at half<br>
maximum of the conductivity peak is measured.<br><br>
Plug flow maintenance is defined as the ratio of the first measurement of the<br>
width of the lamina to the second measurement of the width of the lamina.<br>
Preferably, the plug flow maintenance is greater than 80%, most preferably<br>
greater than 85% and more preferably greater than 90%.<br>
If the plug flow maintenance is greater than 80%, intermixing of reacted<br>
products from one part of the pipe reactor with reactants from an upstream stage<br>
(commonly known as back mixing) is kept to a sufficiently low level to allow the<br>
transesterification reaction to proceed quickly to a high level of conversion. Preferably,<br>
the level of conversion exceeds 95%, more preferably greater than 96.5%. The level of<br>
conversion can be measured by determining the quantity of natural oil remaining at the<br>
end of the reaction as a percentage of natural oil fed in, Q % and representing<br>
conversion as 100 - Q%. The inventors have identified that to optimise the use of<br>
mixing energy, heat, catalyst, and equipment, the maximum reduction in back mixing is<br>
required so that stoichiometric ratios should be maintained as much as is possible.<br>
Reynolds number and power input<br>
Another measure of the mixing applied in the present invention is to specify the<br>
Reynolds number and the energy input.<br>
The Reynolds number given by the expression:<br>
Re = p V d/μ.<br>
Where p = average density of materials (which can be determined by the person<br>
skilled in the art using their common general knowledge).<br>
V = average velocity.<br>
d = Hydraulic diameter. This can be calculated by the person skilled in the art in<br>
a manner known from their common general knowledge<br><br>
μ = effective viscosity, which can be calculated by the person skilled in the art in<br>
accordance with their common general knowledge, approximating the reactant mixture<br>
as a single phase..<br>
Preferably, the Reynolds number in the present invention is in the range 200-<br>
10000, more preferably 500-6000.<br>
Mixing power input can be calculated my multiplying the pressure drop across<br>
the pipe reactor by the volume flow rate. The degree of mixing can be represented by<br>
the power per unit weight of reactants. With the present invention the power per unit<br>
weight preferably exceeds 0.5 W/kg, being more preferably in the range 1 W/kg to<br>
10W/kg, more preferably more than 3W/kg and preferably less than 8W/kg.<br>
Mixer Design<br>
It is found that the present invention allows a high level of conversion (in excess<br>
of 95%) to be achieved in a time period which is less than five minutes, preferably less<br>
than two minutes and with good quality oil, in less than one minute.<br>
It is found that a number of methods and structures may be used to ensure that<br>
the reactants pass along the pipe reactor under transitional or turbulent conditions and so<br>
that the reactants are mixed in a direction normal to the flow direction such that the time<br>
taken for 90% of the elements of fluid to pass through the reactor is within 20% of the<br>
mean residence time of reactant in the reactor.<br>
Such constructions and methods may also be applied to achieve the desired<br>
maintenance of plug flow and residence time distribution.<br>
For example, the pipe reactor may comprise a plain pipe without any mixing<br>
elements. If the flow is maintained at a correct rate such that flow is either turbulent or<br>
at the transition between turbulent and laminar flow, and the pipe is of sufficient length,<br>
the required plug flow and residence time distribution maintenance may be obtained.<br><br>
Preferably, however, static mixing elements are present in the pipe reactor. In a<br>
preferred embodiment, the static mixing elements are present within selected pipe<br>
sections required to perform specific mixing operations needed during the reaction.<br>
Preferably the static mixing elements are of a design which provide a higher<br>
level of deviation of the fluid flow path in a direction normal to the flow direction<br>
through the pipe reactor than in a direction parallel to the flow direction through the<br>
pipe reactor. They mix specifically radially across the pipe.<br>
Suitable design of static mixer element can be obtained from Sultzer or<br>
Chemineer, and are chosen for their effect on residence time distribution (dispersion)<br>
as a function of length and unit length capital costs.<br>
It is found that some designs of static mixer are less dispersive at high Reynolds<br>
number. In order to determine a suitable design of static mixer, variation of residence<br>
time distribution (suitably measured by the test described above) against pressure drop<br>
is measured. Pressure drop can then be multiplied by flow rate to give the mixing<br>
power input. Accordingly, for a given mixing power input, the optimum mixer design<br>
can be chosen which gives minimum dispersion.<br>
Static mixer elements may be present for at least part of the length of the pipe<br>
reactor. Static mixer elements are preferably present for at least the first 20% of the<br>
length, more preferably for at least the first 30% of the length. Preferably, static mixer<br>
elements are present for at least the last 30%, more preferably for at least the last 20%<br>
of the length of the pipe reactor.<br>
Preferably, there is a portion of the pipe reactor which has no mixer elements.<br>
This portion is preferably at least 20% and more preferably at least 30% of the length of<br>
the reactor. Preferably, the portion of the pipe reactor which has no mixer elements is<br>
displaced from the ends thereof<br><br>
Preferably, 30-40% of the mixers, by length, are in the first part of the pipe<br>
reactor and 60-70% by length of the static mixers are in the last part of the pipe reactor.<br>
It is formed that, in a first stage of the reaction, where there is a very large<br>
quantity of unreacted natural oil, a high degree of mixing is beneficial for obtaining a<br>
high rate of reaction. In a middle section of the process, a substantial portion of the<br>
natural oil has been converted to mono- or diglycerides. These are found to have<br>
surfactant properties. This can enhance the mixing of the reactants in the middle part of<br>
reaction. In a final part of the reaction, a substantial proportion of the natural oil has<br>
been converted to methyl esters and it is found that further mixing is beneficial.<br>
Preferably, over 95%, more preferably over 96.5% by weight of natural oil is<br>
converted in a single pass through the pipe reactor. Preferably, there is no further<br>
transesterification reactor. Preferably, the residence time of the reactant in the pipe<br>
reactor is less than five minutes, more preferably less than 2.5 minutes, most preferably<br>
less than two minutes, and in some cases, several tens of seconds.<br>
The pipe reactor may comprise a section comprising mixer elements which is<br>
located upstream of a point at which short chain alcohol, alkaline catalyst or a mixture<br>
thereof, is injected into the flow. This ensures that the flow is already turbulent at the<br>
point at which the reactants are mixed, obtaining a high level of intermixing and<br>
reaction.<br>
Biodiesel Production Process<br>
The method and apparatus of the present invention preferably form part of a<br>
process for producing biodesiel from a fuel crop. Such a process typically comprises the<br>
following steps:<br><br>
a)	The fuel crop, typically in the form of seed or nuts, (but also can be<br>
animal derived tallow) is received. Optionally, they are treated by washing,<br>
cleaning, grading, removal of foreign objects etc.<br>
b)	Seeds or nuts are crushed. This may be carried out in one or more steps<br>
in apparatus known to the person skilled in the art. The natural oil is obtained from the<br>
crushed seeds or nuts, for example by pressing.<br>
c)	Hexane treatment. . The person skilled in the art will be aware of<br>
suitable techniques for hexane treatment. Suitably, hexane is recycled.<br>
d)	Degumming. This is process whereby phospholipids typically obtamed<br>
from the shell material of the seeds or nuts are removed. Typically, the oil is heated to a<br>
reaction temperature which is suitably in the range 80-150°C, more preferably around<br>
90-120°C. It is then reacted with phosphoric acid which polymerises phospholipids to<br>
form solids which are then separated by gravity. Treated oil is removed from the top of<br>
the separation tank. Separated polymerised phospholipids are removed from the bottom<br>
ofthe tank and disposed of They may be burnt. Heat released by burning may be used<br>
to heat the process.<br>
f)	Esterification of free fatty acid. Natural oil typically contains a certain<br>
quantity of non-esterified free fatty acid. If this is present during the biodiesel synthesis<br>
step, it tends to form soap with alkali catalyst which introduces an impurity and affects<br>
the reaction in the biodiesel synthesis. Free fatty acid is typically converted by<br>
esterifying with short chain alcohol to produce biodiesel. The esterification may be<br>
carried out with a C1-C4 alcohol, branched or straight, most preferably methanol or<br>
ethanol. This process is typically carried out at a temperature in the range 100-153°C,<br>
suitably about 120-140°C.<br>
Typically, the short chain fatty acid will be added in substantial excess in order<br>
to drive this reaction to completion. Excess short chain alcohol may be removed by<br>
evaporation. Condensed short chain alcohol may be returned to an earlier stage in the<br>
process.<br>
g)	biodiesel synthesis by transesterification, according to the invention<br>
h) separation. Separation may be achieved by any conventional means, for<br>
example, by gravity separation, by centrifuging or by cyclone, with or without<br><br>
coalescing systems or internal devices such as weirs, or external devices such as boots<br>
(extra lower chambers designed to concentrate heavy phase material prior to removal).<br>
Any or all of the downstream separation devices may be pressurised and operate<br>
at the same downstream pressure at the end of the pipe reactor. This will allow<br>
separation to occur before the remaining reactor pressure is dropped to downstream<br>
operation levels, via pressure drop valves, into light and heavy phases. The benefit of<br>
such an arrangement is that the excess energy remaining within the reactor (as pressure)<br>
is not dissipated across a multiphase pressure drop valve. Accordingly, the mixing of<br>
the biodiesel, methanol and glycerine mixture by the pressure drop process is avoided.<br>
This allows separation to occur more quickly and efficiently with lower capital<br>
expensive equipment.<br>
Glycerine separated from the biodiesel may be disposed of by any suitable<br>
means, for example it may be burnt to provide heat for the processes described above.<br>
Preferably, the apparatus of the present invention comprises part of a plant<br>
which comprises at least one of the apparatus for degumming the natural oil and<br>
apparatus for esterifying free fetty acid, preferably both.<br>
There is preferably a heater for heating natural oil which is fed to degumming<br>
apparatus or the apparatus for esterifying free fatty acid.<br>
Where both a degumming apparatus and apparatus for esterifying free fatty acid<br>
are present, the natural oil is preferably passed through the degumming apparatus first.<br>
Preferably, there is a feed means, for example, a pipe, from the degumming<br>
apparatus to the biodiesel synthesis apparatus of the present invention or from the<br>
degumming apparatus to the apparatus for esterifying free fatty acid or from the<br>
apparatus for esterifying free fetty acid to the biodiesel synthesis apparatus of the<br>
present invention. Preferably, there is no intermediate cooling step in which the<br>
temperature is dropped to close to ambient temperature. In this way, heat energy<br>
delivered to the natural oil at the beginning of the process can be retained, reducing the<br>
heat energy required to be put into the apparatus.<br><br>
It should be noted that, where free fatty acid is removed after the step of<br>
esterifying free fatty acid, the natural oil may be cooled due to the removal of the latent<br>
heat of vaporisation of the short chain alcohol. However, this is not designed as a<br>
cooling step. Further, the temperature of the natural oil is typically not reduced by this<br>
step to ambient temperature.<br>
Where short chain alcohol is removed by vapourisation, the short chain alcohol<br>
can be separately condensed and the latent heat of vaporisation used to heat the natural<br>
oil. Preferably, it is used to heat the natural oil from ambient temperature. It is found<br>
that the heat transfer is most efficient when the temperature difference between the hot<br>
fluid and the cold fluid is at its greatest.<br>
A further heating may be required for heating natural oil which has been cooled<br>
by removal of free short chain alcohol, to the temperature required in the biodiesel<br>
synthesis apparatus.<br>
A heat exchanger may be provided for transferring heat from biodiesel which<br>
has been prepared in the biodiesel synthesis apparatus to the natural oil which is fed into<br>
it.<br>
Short chain alcohol which is condensed may be reused in the step of esterifying<br>
free fatty acid.<br>
Biodiesel production on a Ship<br>
In the second aspect, the present invention provides a ship, comprising means<br>
for storing a raw material used in the synthesis of biodiesel, a plant for processing for<br>
the raw material, to create biodiesel and means for storing the biodiesel formed and a<br>
system for offloading the vegetable oil from onshore without a conventional pier, jetty<br>
or dock.<br><br>
In fee second aspect of fee invention, a biodiesel production plant is mounted on<br>
ship. An economic benefit of using a travelling ship based processing system is feat fee<br>
excess heat generated through fee natural inefficiencies of all combustion engines,<br>
whether feey be petrol, diesel internal combustion or gas turbine, can be captured and<br>
used to heat fee oil and fats throughout fee entire biodiesel process. The kinetic energy<br>
required within the process relating to fee pumping of fee fluids is small being around 5<br>
to 10% of fee entire biodiesel processing cost. This energy could be obtained as a by<br>
product of fee ship's steam supply (to feen convert to electricity), or taken off ship's<br>
electricity supply. The choice of where fee pumping energy comes from will be based<br>
on fee specifics of fee ship's system and fee economics.<br>
The biodiesel production plant will preferably be made suitable for use at sea (or<br>
'marinized') for example to provide resistance to corrosion from sea water and<br>
resistance to fee rolling motion of a ship at sea.<br>
The marinized process plant can be made modular for ease of maintenance,<br>
speed of assembly through concurrent production and, if required, transferred easily to<br>
ofeer ships' hulls once fee ship's life is over, after maybe twenty years service.<br>
The main modifications required to fee ship will be as follows;<br>
(i) Hold configuration preferably comprises a separate hold for mefeanol, so as to<br>
store fee initial charge of basic methanol required to process fee biodiesel. As fee<br>
methanol will be recovered and reused throughout fee process only 10% by volume of<br>
mefeanol as a portion of fee oil processed will be required. However as wife all<br>
industrial systems inefficiencies will be encountered so somewhere between 10 and<br>
15% by volume mefeanol should be stored prior to use.<br>
(ii) Hold configuration preferably comprises a plurality of compartments for oil.<br>
Preferably, as each compartment of oil is processed into biodiesel in turn, to minimise<br>
any reprocessing of already processed material.<br>
(iii) Preferably, heat exchangers feat can be switched from conventional sea water/<br>
oil to vegetable oil / engine oil are provided as fee ship's engines should be<br><br>
conventionally cooled dining the outward journey and cooled to some degree with the<br>
vegetable oil during any processing.<br>
(iv) Gas turbines can bum vegetable oils especially when low in free fatty acid and<br>
could be configured to bum (if hot enough) the glycerine by product, for example as a<br>
part blend with vegetable oil, biodiesel or conventional marine diesel.<br>
(v) Preferably, the deck is reinforced to hold and retain the process modules.<br>
The ship of the second aspect of the invention may not be capable of propelling<br>
itself, comprising, for example, a barge, that can be moored indefinitely. The<br>
advantages with barges are size, cost and longevity of life due to construction as some<br>
are made of concrete and other inert marine materials.<br>
The third aspect of the present invention is suitable for use with the second aspect of the<br>
invention.<br>
There may further be processing plant for extracting oil or fat from primary sources<br>
such as seeds, and optionally for treating the oil. The plant may comprise biodiesel<br>
synthesis plant, for example, according to the first aspect of the invention.<br>
There may be a plurality of storage containers, such as tanks, tank farms or the like.<br>
There may be a plurality of floating loading points.<br>
The system may correspond to systems used for the loading of mineral oil onto ships.<br>
The CALM buoy may be as used in systems for the loading of mineral oil and may be<br>
as described m EP1506920 or GB2250253.<br>
The present invention will be further described by way of example only with<br>
reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
Figure 1 is a schematic illustration of an apparatus fot carrying out the process<br>
of the present invention.<br>
Figure 2 is a schematic plan of a plant for synthesis of biodiesel from a raw<br>
material.<br><br>
Figure 3 is a schematic view of ship according to the second aspect of the<br>
invention.<br>
Figure 4 is a schematic view of a CALM buoy system according to the third<br>
aspect of the invention.<br>
The apparatus of Figure 1 comprises a pipe reactor 10.<br>
A natural oil is fed through pipe 20 from a source (not shown) having been<br>
optionally heated.<br>
The oil may be heated to any suitable temperature, for example being in excess<br>
of 40°C, more preferably in excess of 40°C and most preferably in the range 45-130°C .<br>
Alkaline catalyst is fed from a tank 30 and mixed in a mixer 40 with short chain<br>
alcohol from a tank 50.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, the short chain alcohol and the alkaline catalyst<br>
may be supplied ready mixed. The mixer 40 also comprises a pump for feeding the<br>
mixture of short chain alcohol and alkaline catalyst under pressure through a tube 50<br>
into the tube 20. The tube 50 terminates in jet nozzles 51 directed generally normal to<br>
the direction of flow through the pipe 20. This generates turbulence in the pipe 20. The<br>
turbulent mixture of natural oil, short chain alcohol and alkaline catalyst is fed into the<br>
pipe reactor 10.<br>
At least in the first part, the pipe reactor 10 comprises mixing elements 11 which<br>
are of a configuration such that they cause mixing in a direction normal to the direction<br>
of flow (indicated by arrow A) through the pipe reactor 10 in preference to mixing in a<br>
direction parallel to the flow direction A.<br>
The pipe reactor 10 has an input end 12 and an output end 13. At or very close<br>
to the input and output end 12 and 13, conductivity measurers 14 and 15 respectively<br>
axe provided.<br><br>
A dosing means 60 is provided for measuring the plug flow and residence time<br>
distribution maintenance in the pipe reactor 10 between the input and output ends 12<br>
and 13.<br>
At the output end 13, reaction products comprising biodiesel, glycerol and small<br>
quantities of un-reacted components are fed to further treatment (not shown).<br>
A controller 70 is provided for controlling and monitoring the output of the<br>
conductivity metres 14 and 15.<br>
The dosing device 60 can be used to inject into the flow in pipe 20 a quantity of<br>
one molar sodium chloride in such a quantity to form a lamina at least one centimetre<br>
wide in the direction normal to the flow direction A.<br>
The conductivity devices 14 and 15 can then be used in conjunction with the<br>
controller 70 to measure the plug flow and residence time distribution maintenance<br>
across the length of the reactor by the method described above.<br>
Figure 2 is a schematic view of a complete plant for biodiesel symthesis from<br>
materials such as nuts or seeds. The nuts or seeds are initially crushed and pressed in a<br>
crusher 101. Suitable designs of crusher or press are the known to the person skilled in<br>
the art. The crushed and pressed seed material is rejected at 102 and may be disposed<br>
of, for example by burning to generate heat or as feedstock for animals. Hexane<br>
extraction may be used to further enhance oil collection firom the seeds. Partially<br>
treated raw natural oil is fed to heat exchanger 105. The heat exchanger 105 raises the<br>
temperature of the partially treated raw natural oil to about 100°C and it is then fed into<br>
a degumming plant.<br>
Suitable designs of hexane extractor will be known to the person skilled in the<br>
art. Suitable designs of deguroming plant are known to the person skilled in the art. In<br>
the degumming plant 106, phosphoric acid, stored in a tank 107 is dosed into the heated<br>
partially treated raw natural oil to polymerise phospholipids which are precipated and<br>
collected at 108 for disposal. Secondary treated natural oil is then collected at the top of<br><br>
the vessel and fed to a second heat exchanger 109 where the temperature is raised to<br>
130°C. The heated secondary treated raw natural oil is fed to a reaction vessel 110.<br>
Also fed to the reaction vessel is a short chain alcohol, for example methanol, stored in<br>
a vessel 111 and a mineral acid catalyst, stored in the vessel 112. The minered acid<br>
catalyses the esterification of firee fatty acid in the secondary raw natural oil to generate<br>
methyl esters of the fatty acids (i.e. biodiesel) so that any free fatty acid is removed.<br>
The fmal treated raw natural oil obtained is then fed into a separator 113. An<br>
excess of short chain alcohol is used in the reactor 110 to drive the esterification<br>
reaction to a high degree of completion. The short chain alcohol is removed in the<br>
separator 113 as a vapour.<br>
The vapour is transferred by a line 114 and condensed, the heat being used in the<br>
heat exchanger 105 as shown schematically in Figure 2. Other arrangements for<br>
transferring the heat of condensation of the methanol may be used. However, it is<br>
beneficial that the heat exchange to remove heat from the vapourised methanol is<br>
achieved by contacting it with the raw natural oil which is at ambient temperature.<br>
Because these have a very great temperature difference, the heat exchange is rapid and<br>
efficient.<br>
The natural oil will be typically cooled by the vapourisation of the methanol to<br>
about 50-60°C and needs to be heated again in a third heat exchanger 114, where it is<br>
heated to a temperature of 130°C. The heated oil is then fed into a pipe reactor 115<br>
which is as shown in Figure 1. Also shown schematically are the supply of alkaline<br>
catalyst 116 and short chain alcohol 117 of Figure 1. Further details of the pipe reactor<br>
are as shown in Figure 1 and are not described here.<br>
A mixture of biodiesel and glycerine is obtained in the pipe reactor 115 which is<br>
then fed to a separator 116 where glycerine and used alkaline catalyst are separated and<br>
rejected at 117 for disposal, burning or reuse as appropriate. Finally, a high quality<br>
biodiesel is obtained at 118.<br><br>
Figure 3 shows a schematic view of a ship according to the second aspect of the<br>
invention. The ship 200 may be a coaster or tanker of conventional size and design.<br>
However, it is provided with a first store 201 for a raw material. The raw<br>
material may comprise unprocessed nuts or seeds or some form of natural oil which has<br>
been wholly or partially treated as shown in Figure 2 at any stage up to the separator<br>
113.<br>
Feeding means (for example a pump or conveyor - not shown) are provided for<br>
feeding the raw material to a plant 202 for the synthesis of biodiesel. The plant may<br>
correspond to the pipe reactor of Figure 1 or the plant shown in Figure 2 or any<br>
combination of pipe reactor of Figure 1 and oil processing steps such as are known in<br>
the art. The plant 202 is shown mounted in a deck house, but may be mounted in a<br>
separate hold. Biodiesel generated in the plant 202 is delivered to a second tank 203<br>
where it is stored.<br>
According to preferred aspect of the second aspect of the invention, heat<br>
required for the process carried out in the plant 202 can be obtained as waste heat from<br>
the engine 204 of the ship.<br>
Figure 4 shows a schematic view of a system for loading biodiesel or oils and<br>
fats suitable for synthesis of biodiesel from land to ships.<br>
A storage facility 300 is provided, containing biodiesel or natural fats and oils<br>
suitable for the synthesis of biodiesel, produced in the area near the system. The facility<br>
300 may include a plant for the treatment of the oil, and optionally for synthesis of<br>
biodiesel.<br>
A pump 301 is provided for pumping oil or biodiesel from the facility 300<br>
through a pipeline 302, that extends underwater along the seabed to a CALM buoy<br>
303. The CALM buoy is anchored in water deep enough allow a ship 304 to lies<br>
alongside the buoy or tie up to it, to allow oil or biodiesel to be pumped into the ships<br>
holds.<br><br>
Example<br>
A flow of sunflower oil heated to 80°C is fed to a 6mm diameter pipe reactor at<br>
a rate of 30 litres/hour under a pressure of 4-bar gauge.<br>
The pipe reactor is insulated but not separately heated. It is of length 15m.<br>
Kenics ™ KMX mixer elements axe placed in the reactor and fill 60% of the pipe<br>
length.<br>
A supply of KOH and methanol at ambient temperature is prepared and fed<br>
under pressure into the flow of oil through nozzles extending at right angles to the flow<br>
direction of the oil to generate turbulence.<br>
The ratio by mass of the flow rate of sunflower oil to methanol is 4:1.<br>
The KOH is initially mixed with the methanol at a weight ratio of 24.5g solid<br>
KOH to 1 litre dry methanol.<br>
Retention time of the reaction mixture is 90 seconds.<br>
Plug flow maintenance as measured by the method described above exceeds<br>
90%.<br>
The time taken for 90% of the elements of fluid to pass through the reactor is<br>
within 20% of the mean residence of time reactant in the reactor, determmed by the<br>
process described above.<br>
Over 96.5% conversion to methyl ester (biodiesel) is obtained.<br><br>
