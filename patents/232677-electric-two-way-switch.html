This invention relates to domestic electrical switches, which does not get jammed or stuck in center position and it has a jointless center terminal clamping and detachable outer rocker. The jointless center terminal clamping reduces the material content and with the detachable outer rocker when detached or taken out, persons will be able to still operate the switch without any electric hazard. The outer, rocker can be in different colours to match the room decor.<br>
Switches of various types are known in the art. But the conventional switches do not have<br>
the following features although some switches have a detachable outer rocker:	<br>
1.	Pointed plunger and inverted 'V' profile in the Center terminal.<br>
2.	The switch cannot be pressed in the center position.<br>
3.  Built-in snaps in the switch baste for clamping center terminal to the switch base with out screws or rivets.<br>
4.	The switch is operable without any electric hazard even with the Inner rocker.<br>
5.	Open circular groove in the inverted "V" portion for inserting thin circular Silver rod for switches of higher ratings.<br>
6.	Detachable Outer cover to match the colour of the switch with room decor.<br>
In the switch of the present invention, all the above-mentioned features are provided compared to conventional switches.<br>
/ Accordingly, it is the primary object of the present invention to provide a switch which<br>
can not be pressed in the center position &amp; which has a reliable quick make &amp; break and<br>
hence prevent accidental short circuit between line &amp; neutral of a domestic supply system<br>
and accidental connection of electrical supply to electrical appliance connected to the<br>
switch.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide a method of fixing center terminal to switch base with lower metal content.<br>
Still further objects of the present invention are to provide a switch with enhanced rating with lesser silver content by inserting a silver rod into an open circular groove in the<br><br>
center terninal and with a<br><br>
provision to change the outer colour of the switch to match<br><br>
[room decor with detachable outer cover.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a mounting plate for the switch described above, with luminous, translucent, indicator strips.<br>
The switch is designed as a module with unique mounting locks compared to other modular switches, which can be fitted in the guided slots in the module (mounting) plates, where as other modular switches and sockets generally have extended arms or legs for locking the switches on to the mounting plates. These locking extended arms or legs of conventional switches are prone to break during installation. Further small projections provided in the switch base prevent switch insertion deeper in the module plate.<br>
The base of the switch is designed to hold the center terminal in its position with the help of built in snaps provided in the switch base. It has been designed very precisely that the terminal can easily snap fit in to base so that the contact system is always making contact at the same point even after repeated switching operations.<br>
By this precise arrangement of the terminal &amp; achieving the consistent contact making point also reduces the material content of the Contacts.<br>
The inner rocker is so designed that it can be operated with out outer cover even by a child with out any hazard of electrocution. The inner rocker has supports/slots to accommodate the snaps of the outer cover, which easily fits with the switch assembly.<br>
The Switching mechanism is designed such that the moving contact cannot be held in the center position. It is supported by the arrangement of the pointed plunger &amp; inverted 'V profile of the center terminal. By this arrangement the moving contact is always held between two pointed surfaces, which does not allow the moving contact to stay in the center position.<br>
The design of the plunger is done so precisely to achieve the above said phenomena and the plunger is backed up by the spring which enforces the necessary contact pressure on to the moving contact. The contact pressure is fully concentrated on the contact point<br><br>
because of the pointed plunger by whichthe magnitude of the arcing is less during switching.<br>
This invention also provides mounting plate assembly for an electrical switch comprising an inner mounting plate having the necessary opening in the center for placing the switch assembly, the side ends of the opening being provided with means for receiving luminous, translucent indicator strips, means for fixing/mounting on the wall and an outer cover which will be mounted on the inner mounting plate. The indicator strip is provided with integral means for clipping on to the inner plate.<br>
This invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein:<br>

Fig.2.     Show different views of the electric Switch;<br>
Fig.3.     Shows blown up view of the Rocker mechanism;<br>
Fig.4.     Shows blow up view of the center terminal mounting arrangement in the base of the switch;<br>
Fig.5.     Shows blown up view of center terminal with a thin silver rod inserted in the open circular groove in the inverted "V" part for rating enhancement<br>
Fig.6A.   show the assembled mounting plate;<br>
Fig.6B.   shows the outer cover of the mounting plate;<br>
Fig. 6C. shows the inner mounting plate; and<br>
Figs.7A to 7D show the isometric view, elevational view, bottom view and side view of the luminous indicator strip.<br>
As can be seen from the Figures, the switch of the present invention has the following parts. A Base generally marked by reference numeral 1 wherein the center terminal 2 along with outer terminals 3 are placed. The center terminal 2 is fixed to the switch base 1 without any rivet or screws. It is held in the base with the help of two snaps 13 built into the base of the switch. The snaps are integral part the switch base and are formed when the switch base is moulded. This eliminates the need for additional parts like a rivet or a screw for fixing the center terminal to the switch base. The method of using a screw for fixing center terminal to switch is prone to loosening of screw over a period of time. The<br><br>
invented method of fixing the center terminal to screw base improves long time reliability of the switch.<br>
The center terminal 2 is designed in the form of an inverted 'V' referred by reference numeral 4 on which the moving contact 5 rocks between the other two outer terminals 3.<br>
A plunger 6, which has a spring action, is mounted on the inner rocker 7.J The spring<br>
action of the plunger is enabled by a spring 8.   The Plunger 6 is specially designed to<br>
have a pointed tip 9 and the end of the center terminal 2 which is in contact with the<br>
moving contact 5 is designed in the form an inverted "V". This helps in preventing switch<br>
operation when the rocker is pressed in the center and prevents accidental electrical<br>
contacts between the center terminal and outer terminal-1 and also with the outer<br>
terminal-2 in a 2-way switch. The invented design of the rocker mechanism with pointed<br>
plunger and inverted "V" shaped center terminal avoids accidental short circuit between<br>
line &amp; neutral of a domestic supply system and avoids accidental connection of electrical<br>
supply to electrical appliance connected to the switch.<br>
The moving contact 5 has two contacting tips 10 &amp; 11. On the inner rocker 7, a detachable outer cover 12 is placed. When the switch is put in position "1" (called "ON" position in a 1-way switch), the moving contact moves towards the outer terminal-1 and establishes an electrical contact between the center terminal and the outer terminal-1 with the help of the rocker mechanism and the plunger with spring. When the switch is put in position-2 (called "OFF" position in a 1-way switch), the moving contact moves away from the outer terminal-1 and breaks the contact between the center terminal and the outer terminal-1 and makes contact with outer terminal-2 in a 2-way switch. In both positions the moving contact always remains in contact with the center terminal.<br>
In order to increase the rating of the switch with out using excessive expensive material like silver, an open circular groove is provided in the inverted "V" portion of the center terminal for inserting a thin silver circular rod 14, still retaining in all the above-mentioned features.<br>
Inner Rocker is so designed that the switch can be operated even with out the outer rocker with out any hazard of electrocution. A unique locking arrangement 15 is provided on the<br><br>
base 1 for locking of the switch with the necessary module plates (not shown in the figures).<br>
One/one-set of contact tip/s is/are riveted on to the moving contact depending on whether switch is to be used as a 1-way or a 2-way switch. The outer terminals are fitted on to the switch base with contact tips by riveting. The center terminal is snap fitted into the switch base. The riveted moving contact is placed into groves provided in the switch base.<br>
The plunger is fitted to the spring &amp; inserted inside the Inner rocker. The inner rocker has a vertical circular shaft to house the plunger with spring. The vertical circular shaft has a step inside it so that spring gets locked in to the shaft.<br>
The inner rocker is placed on the top of the assembled base and pressed to lock it on to<br>
the switch base. The outer cover is snap fitted on to the inner rocker. It is very clearly<br>
seen from the figure that the moving Contact is held freely between the two pointed<br>
profiles of the plunger &amp; the center terminal. The pointed surfaces do not allow the<br>
moving contact to stay in the center position of the switch so that the switch cannot be<br>
pressed in the center. The switch does not stay in the center position during the switching<br>
operations. Either it is in position 1 (ON) or position 2 (OFF). The pointed profile of the<br>
plunger concentrates the entire force exerted by the back up spring, so that the entire force<br>
is transferred to the moving the contacts during the switch operation to ensure quick make<br>
or break.	c -      ,   ,-  ; 
/W-&gt;   cv'ir^j' '■■   ■'"-<br>
The center terminal is just snap fitted into the vertical rectangular slot in the switch base<br>
and is held in position by the snaps built into the switch base. Because of this<br>
arrangement there is no need for Rivet/Screw to fix the center terminal to the switch base.<br>
This arrangement reduces metal content. The snaps are so designed so that they prevent<br>
any movement of the center terminal. Fig 5, Shows how a thin silver rod is inserted in the<br>
open circular groove made in the inverted "V" part of the center terminal for enhancing<br>
rating of the switch.	7 ^Jv<br>
Figs. 6A to C and 7A to D clearly illutrate the mounting plate and the luminous strip used therein. The mounting plate has the necessary openingl6 and the luminous strips 17. The said strip 17 is provided with integral means 18 such as four hooks for clipping on to     /<br><br>
The invention is not restricted to the described and illustrated exemplary embodiments. In fact it also covers all specialist developments with in the scope of the idea of the<br>
invention. For example, the mounting arrangement of the switch is not only restricted to<br>
■<br>
it, but the sockets the inventor has developed also have similar mounting arrangement for mounting them on to the module/mounting plates.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
