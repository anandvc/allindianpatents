				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] The present invention relates to systems, methods and apparatus for providing water. Embodiments include systems, methods and apparatus for water desalination and purification including the removal of dissolved solids and contaminants from sea water and brackish water. Systems of the present invention may be advantageously utilized to provide potable, or otherwise purified water, from a seawater or brackish water source.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] The antiquity of water supply systems is well established. The practice of water treatment dates back to at least 2000 B.C., when Sanskrit writings on medical lore recommended storage of water in copper vessels, exposure of water to sunlight, filtering through charcoal, and boiling of foul water for the purpose of making water drinkable.<br>
[0004] Later, two significant advancements helped to establish drinking water treatment. In 1685, the Italian physician Lu Antonio Porzio designed the first multiple-stage filter. Prior to that, in 1680, the microscope was developed by Anton Van Leeuwenhoek. With the discovery of the microspope enabling the detection of microorganisms and the ability to filter out these microorganisms, the first water-filtering facility was built in the town of Paisley, Scotland, in 1804 by John Gibb. Within three years, filtered water was piped directly to customers in Glasgow, Scotland.<br>
[0005] In 1806, a large water treatment plant began operating in Paris with filters made of sand and charcoal, which had to be renewed every six hours. Pumps were<br>
driven by horses working in three snirts. Water was then settled for twelve hours before filtration.<br>
[0006]    In the 1870's, Dr. Robert Koch and Dr. Joseph Lister demonstrated that microorganisms existing in water supplies can cause disease, and then began the quest for effective ways to treat raw water. In 1906, in eastern France, ozone was first used as a disinfectant. A few years later, in the United States, the Jersey City waterworks in 1908 became the first utility in America to use sodium hypochlorite for disinfecting the water supply. Also, in that same year, the Bubbly Creek Plant in Chicago, Illinois, instituted chlorine disinfectant. Over the next several decades, work began on improving the efficiency of filtration and disinfectant.<br>
[0007]    By the 1920's, the filtration technology had evolved so mat pure, clean, bacteria free, sediment free, and particulate free water was available. During World War II, Allied military forces operated in arid areas and began ocean water desalination in order to supply troops with fresh drinking water. In 1942, the U.S. Public Health Service adopted the first set of drinking water standards, and the membrane filter process for bacteriological analysis was approved in 1957. [0008]    By the early 1960's, more than 19,000 municipal water systems were in operation throughout the United States   With the 1974 enactment of the Safe Drinking Water Act, the federal government, the public health community and watei utilities worked together to provide secure water production for the United States. [0009]    The world has a shortage of potable water for drinking and water for agricultural, irrigation, and industrial use  In some parts of the world, prolonged drought and chronic water shortages have slowed economic growth and may eventually cause the abandonment of certain population centers. In other parts of the world, an abundance of fresh water exists, but the water is contaminated with pollution such as chemicals from industrial sources and from agricultural practices. [0010]    The world faces severe challenges in our ability to meet our future water needs. Today there are over 300 million people living in areas with severe water shortages. That number is expected to increase to 3 billion by 2025. About 9,500 children die around the world each day because of poor quality drinking water according to United Nations reports. The population growth has increased the demand on drinking water supplies, while the available water, world wide, has not changed In the coming decades, in addition to improving water reuse efficiency and promoting water conservation, we will need to make additional water resources at a cost and in a<br>
manner that supports urban, rural and agricultural prosperity and environmental protection.<br>
[0011]    There has been a 300 percent increase in water use over the past 50 years. Every continent is expenencing falling water tables, particularly on the southern Great Plains and the Southwest in the United States, and in North Africa, Southern Europe, the entire Middle East, Southeastern Asia, China and elsewhere. [0012]    Evaporation and reverse osmosis are two common methods to produce potable water from sea water or brackish water. Evaporation methods involve heating sea water or brackish water, condensing the water vapor produced, and isolating the distillate. Reverse osmosis is a membrane process in which solutions are desalted or purified using relatively high hydraulic pressure as the driving force. The salt ions or other contaminants are excluded or rejected by the reverse osmosis membrane while pure water is forced through the membrane. Reverse osmosis can remove approximately 95% to approximately 99% of me dissolved salts, silica, colloids, biological materials, pollution, and other contaminants in water. [0013]    The only inexhaustible supply of water is the sea. The desalination of sea water using a land-based plant in quantities large enough to supply a major population center or large scale irrigation projects presents many problems. Land-based plants that desalinate sea water through evaporation methods consume enormous amounts of energy.<br>
[0014]    Land-based plants that desalinate water through reverse osmosis methods generate enormous quantities of effluent comprising the dissolved solids removed from the sea water. This effluent, also referred to as concentrate, has such a high concentration of salts, such as sodium chloride, sodium bromide, etc., and other dissolved solids that simply discharging the concentrate into the waters surrounding a land-based desalination plant would eventually kill the surrounding marine life and danjage the ecosystem. In addition, the concentrate that emerges from conventional land based reverse osmosis desalination plants has a density greater than sea water, and hence, the concentrate sinks and does not quickly mix when conventionally discharged directly into the water surrounding a land-based plant. [0015]    Even if the health of the marine life and ecosystem surrounding a land-based reverse osmosis desalination plant was not a concern, discharging the concentrate into the water surrounding the land-based plant would eventually raise the salinity of the intake water for the plant and foul the membranes of the reverse osmosis system. If a<br>
membrane in a reverse osmosis system is heavily fouled, it must be removed and treated to eliminate the fouling material. In extreme cases, the fouling material cannot be removed, and the membrane is discarded.<br>
(0016]    As a result of all of these factors, potable water produced from land-based reverse osmosis desalination plants is costly and presents significant engineering problems for disposing of the effluent Hence, despite the world's shortage of potable water, only a small percentage of the world's water is produced by the desalination or purification of water using reverse osmosis methods. Therefore, the need exists for a method and system to consistently and reliably supply potable water using desalination technology that does not present the engineering and environmental problems that a conventional land-based desalination plant presents. [0017]    Known ship-board water desalination systems are designed and operated for ship-board consumption of water, and thus are designed and operated according to various maritime standards. Maritime standards for wateT desalination systems and plants and water quality are less stringent man those regulations, standards, and requirements governing the design and operation of land-based desalination plants and systems, especially those promulgated by the United States and the United Nations, in particular the World Health Organization. With the world's increasing shortage of potable water, a need exists to alleviate this shortage. Thus, the need exists for methods and systems that can be utilized at sea to provide desalinated water for land-based consumption of water, which can be produced, stored, maintained, and transported consistent with those regulations, standards, and requirements governing •the design and operation of land-based water desalination plants, systems, and water-quality standards.<br>

The distribution system may comprise apparatus for pumping, piping, storing, transporting, packaging or otherwise distributing the water produced on the vessel. [0089]    For the purposes of this specification, unless otherwise indicated, all numbers expressing quantities of ingredients, reaction conditions, and so forth used in the specification are to be understood as being modified in all instances by the term "about." Accordingly, unless indicated to the contrary, the numerical parameters set<br>
forth in the following specification are approximations that can vary depending upon the desired properties sought to be obtained by the present invention. At the very least, and not as an attempt to limit the application of the doctrine of equivalents to the scope of the claims, each numerical parameter should at least be construed in light of the number of reported significant digits and by applying ordinary rounding techniques.<br>
[0090]    Notwithstanding that the numerical ranges and parameters setting forth the broad scope of the invention are approximations, the numerical values set form in the specific examples are reported as precisely as possible. Any numerical value, however, inherently contains certain errors necessarily resulting from the standard deviation found in their respective testing measurements. Moreover, all ranges disclosed herein are to be understood to encompass any and all subranges subsumed therein, and every number between the end points. For example, a stated range of " 1 to 10" should be considered to include any and all subranges between (and inclusive of) the minimum value of 1 and the maximum value of 10; that is, all subranges beginning with a minimum value of 1 or more, e.g. 1 to 6.1, and ending with a maximum value of 10 or less, e.g., 5.5 to 10, as well as all ranges beginning and ending within the end points, e.g. 2 to 9, 3 to 8, 3 to 9, 4 to 7, and finally to each number 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. 7, 8, 9 and 10 contained within the range. Additionally, any reference referred to as being "incorporated herein" is to be understood as being incorporated in its entirety.<br>
[0091]    It is further noted that, as used in this specification, the singular forms "a," "an," and "the" include plural referents unless expressly and unequivocally limited to one referent.<br>
[0092]    Embodiments of the present invention comprise systems, methods and apparatus for desalinating water from sea water, brackish, and/or polluted water. The systems, methods, and apparatus for desalinating water described herein can generally be operable to be utilized at sea aboard a vessel to provide desalinated water consistent with the standards and requirements generally imposed on land-based water desalination plants and systems. The invention described herein, however, is not limited to sea-based applications, but is provided as one such embodiment [0093]    With reference now to the drawings, and in particular, to Figures 1 and 2, the present invention provides a vessel 101 comprising: a water purification system 200 comprising a water intake system 201 comprising a water intake 202 and a water<br>
intake pump 203; a reverse osmosis system 204 comprising a high pressure pump 205 and a reverse osmosis membrane 206: a concentrate discharge system 207 comprising a plurality of concentrate discharge ports; a permeate transfer system 208 comprising a transfer pump 209; a power source 103; and a control system 210. [0094]    The reverse osmosis system 204 is in communication with the water intake system 201, and the concentrate discbarge system 207 and the permeate transfer system 208 are in communication with the reverse osmosis system 204. The power source 103 is in communication with the water intake system 201. the reverse osmosis system 204, and the permeate transfer system 208. The control system 210 is in communication with the water intake system 201, the reverse osmosis system 204, the concentrate discharge system 207, the permeate transfer system 208, and the power source 103.<br>
[0095] The terms "communicate" or "communication" mean to mechanically, electrically, or otherwise contact, couple, or connect by either direct, indirect, or operational means.<br>
[0096]    The water intake system 20'. provides water to the high pressure pump 205 and the high pressure pump 205 pushes water through the reverse osmosis membrane 206, whereby a concentrate is created on the high pressure side of the reverse osmosis membrane 206. The concentrate is discharged into the water surrounding the vessel 101 through the plurality of concentric discharge ports of the concentrate discharge system 207. On the low pressure sice of the reverse osmosis membrane 206, the permeate created can be transferred from the vessel 101 through the permeate transfer system 208.<br>
[0097]    The vessel 101 may further comprise a propulsion device 102 in communication with the power source 103. A separate power source may provide power to each of the water intake system 201, reverse osmosis system 204, permeate transfer system 208, and propulsion device 102. For example, each of the water intake pump 203, high pressure pump 205, and permeate transfer pump 209 may be in communication with a separate power source. The vessel 101 may be a self-propelled ship, a moored, towed, pushed or integrated barge, or a flotilla or fleet of such vessels. The vessel 101 may be manned or unmanned. The vessel 101 may be either a single hull or double-hull vessel.<br>
[0098) In an alternate embodiment, one power source may provide power to a combination of two or more of the water intake system 201, reverse osmosis system<br>
204, permeate transfer system 208, and propulsion device 102. For example, the electric power for the high pressure pump 205 may be provided by a generator driven by the power source for the vessel's propulsion device, such as a vessel's main engine. In such an embodiment, a step-up gear power take off or transmission would be installed between the main engine and the generator in order to obtain the required synchronous speed. [0099)   Further, an additional coupling between the propulsion device and the main engine allows the main engine to drive die generator while the vessel is not under way. Moreover, an independent power source (not shown), such as a dieseL steam or gas turbine, or combination of such, can power the reverse osmosis system 204, the propulsion device 102, or both.<br>
[0100]    In another embodiment, the power source of water purification system 200 is dedicated to the water purification system 200 and is not in communication with any propulsion device on the vessel 101.<br>
[0101]    In another embodiment, the plurality of concentrate discharge ports of the concentrate discharge system 207 may act as an auxiliary propulsion device for the vessel 101 or act as the sole propulsion device for the vessel 101. Some or all of the concentrate may be passed to propulsion thrusters to provide idling or emergency propulsion.<br>
[0102]    In another embodiment, the power source may comprise electricity producing windmills or water propellers that harness the flow of the air or water to generate power for the water purification system or the operation of the ship. [0103]   The water intake system 201 is capable of taking in water from the body of water surrounding the vessel and providing it to the reverse osmosis system 204. In an embodiment, the water intake 202 of the water intake system 201 comprises one or more apertures in the hull of the vessel below the water line. An example of a water intake 202 is a sea chest. Water is taken into the vessel through the water intake 202 comprising the one or more apertures, passed through the water intake pump 203, and supplied to the high pressure pump 205 of the reverse osmosis system 204. [0104]    The reverse osmosis system 204 comprises a high pressure pump 205 and a reverse osmosis membrane 206. Reverse osmosis membranes are of composite construction and one extensively used form comprises two films of a complex polymeric resin which together define a salt passage. In this process, pretreated raw water is pressed through a semi-permeable barrier that disproportionately favors water permeation over salt permeation. Pressurized feedwater enters a staged array of<br>
pressure vessels containing individual reverse osmosis membrane elements where it is separated into two process streams, permeate and concentrate. Separation occurs as the feed water flows from the membrane inlet to outlet The feed water first enters evenly spaced channels and flows across the membrane surface with a portion of the feed water permeating the membrane barrier. The balance of the feedwater flows parallel to the membrane surface to exit tbe system unfiltered. The concentrate stream is so named because it contains the concentrated ions rejected by the membrane The concentrated stream is also used to maintain minimum crossflow velocity through the membrane element with turbulence provided by the feed-brine channel spacer. The type of reverse osmosis membrane used in the present invention is limited only by its compatibility with the water and/or contaminants in the surrounding body of water. [0105]    The high pressure pump 205, operable to push the raw water through the reverse osmosis membrane 206, comprises any pump suitable to generate the hydraulic pressure necessary to push the raw water through the reverse osmosis membrane 206.<br>
[0106]    In an embodiment, the vessel 101 may comprise a plurality of reverse osmosis systems 104, also referred to as trains. The plurality of reverse osmosis systems may be installed on the vessel's deck 105. The plurality of reverse osmosis systems 104 may also be installed in other parts of the vessel 101. The plurality of reverse osmosis systems 104 may also be installed on multiple levels. For example, each reverse osmosis system of the plurality of reverse osmosis systems 104 may be installed in a separate container. Several containers can be placed on top of each other to optimize the use of the deck 105 on the vessel 101 and to decrease the time and expense associated with construction of the water purification system on the vessel 101. The plurality of reverse osmosis systems 104 are preferably installed in parallel, but other configurations are possible.<br>
[0107]    The permeate transfer system 20S is capable of transferring the permeate produced to a permeate delivery means, such as a tug-barge unit or tanker vessel In an embodiment, the permeate transfer system 208 is capable of transferring the permeate produced to a permeate delivery means comprising a transfer vessel means while the vessel 101 and the transfer vessel means are under way. The permeate transfer system 208 is also capable of transferring the permeate produced to a permeate delivery means comprising a pipeline in communication with the permeate transfer system 208.<br>
[0108]    The control system 210 comprises any system capable of controlling the operation of the water intake system 201, the reverse osmosis system 204, the concentrate discharge system 207, the permeate transfer system 208, and the power source 103 on the vessel 101   The control system 210 is located in a suitable location according to the needs of the vessel 101. The control system 210 may further comprise any system capable of controlling the operation of the vessel 101. In an embodiment, the control system may comprise a processor to make autonomous operational decisions to run the vessel 101 and the water purification system 200. A specific control system envisioned is the TLX software available from Auspice Corp., although other systems can be included in the design such as a programmable logic control (PLC) system.<br>
(01091   The processor generally is in communication with the control system 210. Suitable processors include, for example, digital logical processors capable of processing input, executing algorithms, and generating output Such processors can mclude a microprocessor, an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), and state machines. Such processors include, or can be in communication with media, for example computer readable media, which store instructions that, when executed by the processor, cause the processor to perform the steps described herein as carried out, or assisted, by a processor.<br>
[0110]    One embodiment of a suitable computer-readable medium includes an electronic, optical, magnetic, or other storage or transmission device capable of providing a processor, such as the processor in a web server, with computer-readable instructions. Other examples of suitable media mclude, but are not limited to, a floppy disk, CD-ROM, magnetic disk, memory chip, ROM, RAM, ASIC, configured processor, all optical media, magnetic tape or other magnetic media, or any other medium from which a computer processor can read.

[0111]    In one embodiment, the control system 210 comprises security systems operable to control physical access to the control system 210. In another embodiment, the control system 210 comprises network security systems operable to control electronic access to the control system 210.<br>
[0112]    The concentrate discharge system 207 is configured to increase the mixing of the concentrate discharged into the surrounding body of water. The plurality of<br>
concentrate discharge ports of the concentrate discharge system 207 can be physically located above or below the water line of the vessel 101.<br>
[0113]    Referring now to Figure 3, in an embodiment, a plurality of concentrate discharge ports 301 are physically located in such a way that i portion of the concentrate discharged through the plurality of concentrate discharge ports 301 is capable of being mixed with the water surrounding the vessel 101 by a propulsion device 102 for the vessel 101.<br>
[0114]   In an embodiment comprising a plurality of reverse osmosis systems, a separate concentrate discharge system is connected to each reverse osmosis system. [0115]    Referring now to Figure 4, in another embodiment comprising a plurality of reverse osmosis systems, the concentrate discharged from each reverse osmosis system is collected by the concentrate discharge system 207 iz one or more longitudinally oriented manifold pipes, structural box girders, or tunnels. At intervals along the vessel 101, a plurality of discharge pons 401, allows the concentrate to be discharged over a substantial portion of the vessel's 101 lengih [0116]    Referring now to Figure 5, in another embodiment of the concentrate discharge system 207, each discharge port incorporates a grate 507 designed to assist mixing having divergently oriented apertures 502. A grating with protrusions into the grating's apertures may also be used to assist mixing.<br>
[0117]    In another embodiment, the concentrate discharge pons of the concentrate discharge system 207 are configured in a manner similar to the exhaust nozzles on an F-15 fighter jet such that the concentrate discharge ports may change their circumference and may also change the direction of the flow of the concentrate. [0118]    Referring now to Figure 6, in embodiments where the vessel 101 is moored, the concentrate discharge system 207 may compose a member 601 extending down from the hull of the vessel 101 with a plurality of discharge ports 602 on the member 601. Depending on various factors such as water depth, water temperature, water currents, and the surrounding ecosystem, the member 601 may extend to the depth or depths that optimize the mixing of the concentrate with the surrounding body of water.<br>
[0119]    In an embodiment, the member 602 can be lowered from and retracted to the vessel 101 by mechanical means, such as, for example, a hydraulic assembly. Alternatively, other suitable means can be used to lower and retract the member 602, including those used in conventional maritime drilling operations. In another<br>
embodiment, the member 602 can have sufficient mass and/or density that the member 602 can be lowered from the vessel 602 to a desired depth without mechanical assistance. Such member 602 is generally retracted to the vessel 101 by mechanical means.<br>
{0120]    Referring now to Figure 7, in another embodiment, the concentrate discharge system 207 comprises a member 701 having a plurality of concentrate discharge ports 702 wherein the member 701 floats on the water's surface through the use of support pontoons or a catenary having support pontoons, or the member 701 may be inherently buoyant.<br>
[0121]    In another embodiment, each concentrate discharge port of the concentrate discharge system 207 may be mounted on dispersion devices that enable the discharge ports to move in a full hemi-sphere range. The dispersion devices may comprise a universal joint, a swivel, a gimble, a ball and socket, or other similar devices known to one skilled in the art. Through the oscillation or motion of the plurality of concentrate discharge ports, the concentrate should be more evenly dispersed into the surrounding water.<br>
[0122]    In another embodiment, the concentrate discharge system 207 may further comprise a pump to increase the water pressure of the concentrate prior to being discharged through the plurality of concentrate discharge ports. [0123]    In another embodiment, the vessel 101 further comprises a heat recovery system in communication with the exhaust of a power source, the water intake system 201, the control system 210, and the reverse osmosis system 204. The heat recovery system can use the heat energy generated by one or more power sources to heat the water taken in by the wateT intake system 201 before for the water passes to a reverse osmosis membrane 206.<br>
[0124]    In another embodiment, the vessel 101 may further comprise a heat exchange system in communication with the reverse osmosis system 204 and the concentrate discharge system 207. The heat exchange system comprises a heat exchanger and a cooling system. The heat exchange system reduces the temperature of the concentrate to at or about the temperature of the water surrounding the vessel 101. Since the concentrate normally has an elevated temperature as compared to the temperature of the intake water, installing a heat exchanger system operationally between the reverse osmosis system 204 and concentrate discharge system 207 provides the advantage of reducing or eliminating any impact on the surrounding<br>
ecosystem that could result from the discharge of concentrate at an elevated temperature. In another embodiment, a heat exchange system is in communication with other systems on the vessel 100.<br>
(0125]    Referring now to Figure 8, in another embodiment, the water purification system 200 comprises, a water intake system 201 comprising a water intake 202 and a water intake pump 203, a storage tank 830, a pretreatment system 840, a reverse osmosis system 204 comprising a high pressure pump 205 and a reverse osmosis membrane 206, a concentrate discharge system 207, a permeate transfer system 208 comprising a permeate transfer pump 209, an energy recovery system 810, and a permeate storage tank 220. The energy recovery system 810 is operable to recover or convert into electricity the energy associated with the pressure of the concentrate. [0126]    The storage tank 830 is in communication with the water intake pump 203 and the pretreatment system 840. The pretreatment system 840 is in communication with the storage tank 830 and the high pressure pump 205. The energy recovery device 810 is in communication with the high pressure side of the reverse osmosis membrane 206, the high pressure pump 205, and the concentrate discharge system 207.<br>
[0127]    In an embodiment, the pretreatment system 840 comprises at least one of a debris prefilter system, a reservoir, and a surge tank. A debris filter system is typically used to insure stable, long-term reverse osmosis system performance and membrane life. The debris piefilter system may include clarification, filtration, ultrafiltration, pH adjustment, removal of free chlorine, anriscalant addition, and 5 micron cartridge filtration.<br>
[0128]    In one embodiment, the pretreatment system 840 comprises a plurality of pretreatment systems (not shown). In warm, clean waters, one pretreatment system 840 is generally sufficient. However, colder raw water temperatures (as well as more polluted waters) may require several stages of pretreatment. While the vessel 101 can be custom-built for a predetermined locale, and thus with a single pretreatment system 840, providing the vessel 101 with a plurality of pretreatment systems can permit the vessel 101 to operate in a wide variety of environments across the globe. Such an embodiment for the vessel 101 may enhance the flexibility of governmental or United Nations crisis or disaster-response planning in which disaster locations and environmental conditions cannot be readily anticipated or adequately planned for.<br>
[0129]    The energy recovery system 810 is operable to recover or convert the energy associated with the pressure of the concentrate. Examples of a energy recovery system 810 include devices such as a turbine. The energy recovered can be used to remove a stage of the high pressure pump 205, to assist in interstage boostmg in a two stage water purification system, or to generate electricity.<br>
[0130]    In another embodiment, the vessel 101 further comprises one or more noise and/or vibration reduction devices in communication with any moving mechanical device aboard the vessel 101 and the hull of the vessel 101. Such mechanical devices include, but are not limited to, a power source, a high pressure pump, a transfer pump, and a water intake pump. The noise reduction devices may comprise any isolation, suspension, or shock absorbers known to one skilled in the art. The noise reduction devices also include any noise abatement technique known to one skilled in the art. Noise reduction devices may include a hull comprising composite material or machines with precision manufacturing such that the rattle associated with a mechanical device is reduced when operating.<br>
[0131]    In another embodiment, the vessel 101 further comprises noise and/or vibration reduction devices to dampen vibrations associated with the movement of fluids through piping in the vessel such as encasement on a pipe's exterior. The encasement of a pipe can reduce velocity noise in piping generated by the movement of water. Noise reducnon devices can reduce the vibrations or noise transmitted through the hull of the vessel 101 and thereby reduce any disturbance or interference with normal aquatic or marine life. For example, the noise reduction devices can reduce interference with the acoustic communication between whales. Further, the noise reduction devices can reduce the hearing hazard to the crew of the ship. [0132]    Referring now to Figures 9 through 12 in general, in another embodiment, the vessel 101 further comprises a mixing system in communication with the reverse osmosis system 204 and the concentrate discharge system 207. The mixing system is capable of mixing the concentrate with water taken directly from the surrounding body of water before discharging the concentrate. Such a system is operable to dilute and/or cool the concentrate before returning it to the surrounding body of water. [0133]    Referring now to Figure 9, in an embodiment, a mixing system comprises a mixing tank 905 comprising a concentrate inlet 910, a concentrate outlet 915, a mixing water intake system 920 comprising a water intake and a pump, a series of baffles 925, and a mixing barrier 935 comprising a plurality of apertures 935. wherein<br>
water taken in through the mixing water intake system 920 (i.e. native water) and the concentrate are forced through the mixing barrier and mixed before flowing to the concentrate discharge system 207. The size, shape, location and number of apertures 935 are selected to optimize mixing of the concentrate with the native water. The apertures 935 should induce turbulence in fluids flowing through the mixing barrier 930. The mixing barrier 930 extends from one side of the mixture tank 905 to the opposing side of the mixing tank 905. Adjacent baffles are coupled to opposing sides of the mixing tank 905. The baffles are arranged in a staggered relationship such that a portion of each baffle 925 overlaps with an adjacent baffle 925. The fluid passing though the mixing barrier 930 must follow a convoluted route before reaching the concentrate discharge system 207.<br>
[0134]    In another embodiment (not pictured), the mixing system comprises a mixing tank comprising a concentrate inlet, a concentrate outlet, a mixing water intake system comprising a water intake and a pump, and any device capable of forming a substantially homogeneous mixture from the concentrate and native water. Example of such devices include high speed paddle mixers and a static mixer. [0135]    By mixing the concentrate with native water, the water purification system 200 is capable of returning a diluted concentrate back into the surrounding body of water. For example, if the surrounding body of water contained total dissolved solids (TDS) of 30,000 mg/L and the water purification system were operating at a recovery of 50% permeate, then the TDS of the concentrate would be about 60,000 mg/L. By mixing native water with tie concentrate, the TDS of the diluted concentrate would be between 60,000 and 30,000 TDS.<br>
[0136]    In another embodiment, the water intake of the mixmg tank is operable to provide diluting water to the mixing tank having a TDS below the TDS of the water surrounding the vessel. Examples of sources such diluting water include, but are not limited to, permeate from the reverse osmosis system and rain water collected on the vessel or another vessel.<br>
[0137]    In another embodiment, the water intake of the mixing system is the same water intake as the water intake 202 of the water intake system 201. In another embodiment, the water intake of the mixing system is a separate water intake. The baffles may be oriented horizontally, transversely, or longitudinally. [0138]    Referring now to Figures 10,11, and 12, in an embodiment, the mixing tank 905 of the mixing system comprises a hold 109 in the vessel 101 As shown in Figure3 <br>
10,	in an embodiment, the baffles 925 are oriented transversely. As shown in Figure<br>
11,	in an embodiment, the baffles 925 are oriented longitudinally. As shown in Figure 12, in an embodiment, the baffles 925 are oriented horizontally.<br>
[0139]    Referring again to Figure 1 A, in another embodiment, the vessel 101 further comprises a penneate storage tank comprising holds 109 for the penneate wherein the permeate storage tank is in communication with the reverse osmosis system 204 and the permeate transfer system 208. In another embodiment, the vessel 101 further comprises a packaging system 110 in communication with the permeate storage tank. The packaging system 110 includes extraction pumps with supply lines for drawing permeate out of the permeate storage tank. The packaging system 110 may be used in emergency situations where an infrastructure to distribute the permeate is not in place or has been damaged.<br>
[0140]    In another embodiment, the water purification system 200 of the vessel 101 further comprises a permeate treatment system in communication with the low pressure side of the reverse osmosis membrane 206 and the penneate transfer system 209.

In another embodiment, the permeate treatment system comprises a permeate conditioning system to adjust to taste characteristics of the permeate. In another embodiment, the permeate treatment system comprises a conosion control system, a permeate disinfection system and a permeate conditioning system. In another embodiment, the permeate treatment system is operationally located after the permeate transfer system 208. For example, see the description of one embodiment of the land-based distribution system 1330 below. [0141]    In another embodiment, the vessel 101 comprises a plurality of reverse osmosis systems 104 wherein the vessel 101 is capable of producing 5,000 to 450,000 cubic meters of permeate per day (approximately 1 to 100 million gallons of permeate per day). In other embodiments, the amount of water the vessel 101 is capable of producing will depend on the application and the size of the vessel 101 used. [0142]    In another embodiment, the vessel 101 has a dead weight tonnage (dwt) of between about 10,000 to 500,000. In another embodiment, the vessel 101 has a dwt of between about 30,000 and 50,000. In another embodiment, the vessel 101 has a dwt of between about 65,000 and 80,000   In another embodiment, the vessel 101 has a dwt of between about 120,000   In another embodiment, the vessel 101 has a dwt of<br>
between about 250,000 and 300,000. In another embodiment, the dwt of the vessel 101 depends on the intended application, the minimum draft to keep the vessel 101 afloat, and/or the desired production capacity of the vessel 101. [0143]    Instead of purifying water using reverse osmosis methods, the vessel 101 may be equipped with other water desalination or purification technologies. For example, the vessel may be equipped with multi-stage flash evaporation, multi-effective distillation, or mechanical vapor compression distillation. [0144]    Referring now to Figure 23, in another aspect, the present invention provides a method 2301 for producing a permeate on a floating structure comprising: producing permeate wherein a concentrate is produced 2310; and discharging the concentrate into the surrounding water through a concentrate discharge system comprising a plurality of concentrate discharge ports 2320. [0145]    In an embodiment of the method 2301, the step of producing a permeate comprises pumping water through a reverse osmosis system comprising a high pressure pump and a filter element comprising a reverse osmosis membrane wherein a concentrate is produced on the high pressure side of the reverse osmosis membrane. [0146]    In another embodiment, the method 2301 further comprises the step of having the floating structure travel through the water while discharging the concentrate.<br>
[0147]    In another embodiment, the method 2301 comprises pumping water to be purified through a plurality of reverse osmosis systems in a parallel configuration. [0148]    In another embodiment, the method 2301 further comprises the step of having the floating structure travel through the water in a pattern selected from the group consisting of a substantially circular pattern, an oscillating pattern, a straight line, and any other pattern determined by testing to be most advantageous to dispersing the concentrate into the surrounding water and water currents. [0149]    In another embodiment, the method 2301 further comprises the step of having the floating structure remain substantially fixed relative to a position on land and having the concentrate dispersed by water current.<br>

of propelling the vessel in an auxiliary fashion or as the sole propulsion device.<br>
[0151]    In another embodiment of the method 2301, the method may further<br>
comprise the step of mixing the concentrate with water taken directly from the<br>
surrounding body of water before discharging the concentrate.<br>
[0152]    In an embodiment, the step of mixing the concentrate with water taken<br>
directly from the surrounding body of water comprises passing the concentrate and<br>
the water taken directly from the surrounding body of water together through a series<br>
of baffles before being discharged through the plurality of concentrate discharge<br>
ports. The baffles may be oriented horizontally, transversely, or longitudinally.<br>
Adjacent baffles are coupled to opposing sides of the mixing tank. The baffle* are<br>
arranged in a staggered relation such that a portion of each baffle overlaps with an<br>
adjacent baffle. The water taken in and the concentrate follows a convoluted route<br>
before reaching the concentrate discharge system.<br>
[0153]    The concentrate is discharged in a manner to increase the mixing of the<br>
concentrate with the surrounding body of water.<br>
[0154]    In another embodiment of the method 2301, the plurality of concentrate<br>
discharge ports are physically located in such a way that a portion of the concentrate<br>
discharged through the plurality of concentrate discharge ports is capable of being<br>
mixed with the water surrounding the vessel by the propulsion device.<br>
[0155]    In an embodiment of the method 2301 comprising a plurality of reverse<br>
osmosis systems, a separate concentrate discharge system is connected to each reverse<br>
osmosis system.<br>
[0156]    In an embodiment of the method 2301 comprising a plurality of reverse<br>
osmosis systems, the concentrate discharged from each reverse osmosis system is<br>
collected into one or more longitudinally oriented manifold pipes, structural box<br>
girders, or tunnels. At intervals along the floating structure, the plurality of discharge<br>
ports, allows the concentrate to be discharged over a substantial portion of the floating<br>
structure's length.<br>
[0157]    In another embodiment of the method 2301, each concentrate discharge port<br>
incorporates a grate designed to assist mixing with the surrounding body of water<br>

[01591    In an embodiment of the method 2301 where the floating structure is moored or otherwise stationary, the concentrate discharge may be discharged through a member extending down from the hull of the vessel or over the side of the vessel with a plurality of discharge ports on the member. Depending on various factors such as water depth, water temperature, water currents, and the surrounding ecosystem, the member may extend to the depth or depths that optimize the mixing of the concentrate with the surrounding body of water. In another embodiment, the member having a plurality of concentrate discharge ports may float on the water's surface through the use of support pontoons or a catenary having support pontoons, or through the inherent buoyancy of the member.<br>
[0160]    In another embodiment of the method 2301, each concentrate discharge port may be mounted on dispersion devices that enable the discharge ports to move in a full hemi-sphere range. The dispersion devices may comprise a universal joint, a swivel, a grmble, a ball and socket, or other similar devices known to one skilled in the art. Through the oscillation or motion of the plurality of concentrate discharge ports, the concentrate should be more evenly dispersed into the surrounding water. [0161]    In another embodiment of the method 2301, the concentrate may be further pressurized before being discharged through the plurality of concentrate discharge ports.<br>
[0162J    Figure 13 is a schematic view of an embodiment of the present invention. The system 1301 shown in Figure 13 generally comprises a first vessel 1310 and a means for delivering a penneate from the first vessel 1310 to a land-based distribution system 1330. The terms "land-based,' "on land," "shore-based," and "on shore" refer to systems and structures that are primarily or entirely disposed on land or shore. Portions or components of such systems may be disposed off-shore, on water, or on structures disposed off-shore, on the water, or moored or anchored to the sea-bed. [0163]    The first vessel 1310 includes a means for producing a permeate. In one embodiment, the permeate producing means includes a water purification system (as described in more detail herein). Other structures may be used. Other means for producing a permeate may be used in other embodiments.<br>
[0164]    Generally, the first vessel 1310 includes a converted single-hull tanker. The term "converted" generally refers to a vessel that has been reconfigured to perform a function for which the vessel was not originally designed. Here, the vessel 1310 was originally designed to transport oil. Alternatively, the first vessel 1310 can be a custom-made or custom-built vessel.<br>
[0165]    The first vessel 1310 is located off-shore and includes means for producing a permeate from the surrounding sea water. Topically, the permeate includes desalinated water. As will be described in more detail below, the first vessel 1310 also includes means for mixing a concentrate with sea water. Although the term "sea water" is used, it is to be understood that sea water can include "fresh" water, such as for example, lake water, or any other suitable source of raw water. For example, raw water can even include water delivered from ashore to the first vessel 1310 for desalination or further processing. Previously processed, or partially processed water may thus be refreshed.<br>
[0166]    In the case where the permeate is desalinated water, the concentrate generally includes a brine. Other impurities are likely to be present in the concentrate. The other impurities and total dissolved solids are dependent upon the source of the raw water. It is well known that some bodies of water are more polluted than others and that stagnant water and waters closer to shore generally contain greater amounts of pollutants and total dissohed solids than does the open sea. [0167]    The first vessel 1310 typically includes a dead-weight tonnage (dwt) in a range between approximately 10,000 tons and approximately 500,000 tons. In various embodiments, the first vessel 1310 may have a dead weight tonnage of about 40,000, 80,000, or 120,000. In another embodiment, the first vessel 1310 has a dwt of between about 30,000 and 50.000. In another embodiment, the first vessel 1310 has a dwt of between about 65,000 and 80,000. In another embodiment, the vessel 1310 has a dwt of about 120,000. In another embodiment, the first vessel 1310 has a dwt between about 250,000 and 300,000. In other embodiments, the size of the first vessel 1310 will depend on the intended application, the controlling draft, and the desired production capacity of the first vessel 1310.<br>
[0168]    A capacity of the permeate producing means is generally dependent upon the dead-weight tonnage of the first vessel 1310. However, the capacity of the permeate producing means is not limited by an internal volume formed by the hull of the first vessel 1310, as would be the oil storage capacity of such a vessel.<br>
[0169]    In one embodiment, a portion of the permeate producing means is disposed above a main deck of the first vessel 1310. For example, components of the permeate producing means can be compartmentalized in containers (see Figures 1A and IB) and interconnected to one another and coupled to the main deck. Containerships are known to have containers stacked one atop each other several tiers high along a substantial length of the vessel's main deck.<br>
[0170]     In another embodiment (not pictured) where the propulsion device 102 comprises an electric motor and a propeller in communication with a power source 103, the permeate producing means is disposed below the main deck of the first vessel 1310. In a former embodiment, the power source 103 is also in communication with the permeate producing means. Advantages associated with using an electric motor and propeller to propel the first vessel 1310 include, but are not limited to, optimization of the use of space below the main deck of the first vessel 1310 and reduction in noise created by the first vessel 1310. Advantages associated with disposing the permeate producing means below the main deck of the first vessel 1310 relative to a first vessel 1310 having the permeate producing means disposed on or above the main deck include, but are not limited to, simplification of the hydraulic system for moving fluids, reduction of the number of water pumps, reduction of operating costs, reduction in the dead weight tonnage of the first vessel 1310, and reduction in size of the first vessel necessary to produce rhe same or similar amount of water.<br>
[0171]    Components of the permeate producing means can be arranged in a similar manner to increase the capacity of the permeate producing means otherwise limited by the internal structure of the first vessel 1310. It can be appreciated that such a configured vessel can be modified to adjust the permeate producing capacity of the first vessel 1310 as desired. Thus, the capacity of the permeate producing means generally is in a range between approximately 1 million gallons per day and approximately 100 million gallons per day. Other means for producing permeate may be used in other embodiments. Alternatively, other suitable structures can be used. [0172]   As further described above, the permeate producing means typically includes a reverse osmosis system. Alternatively, other suitable permeate producing means can be used. In one embodiment, the permeate producing means is operable to produce permeate substantially continuously. Generally, while the first vessel 1310 is in motion with respect to shore 1302, the first vessel 1310 can intake seawater 1303 to<br>
process through the permeate producing-meansT-Aletmatively, through the use of intake pumps and other known means, the first vessel 1310 can intake seawater 1303 while not in motion with respect to shore 1302.<br>
[0173]   To be in motion with respect to shore 1302, the first vessel 1310canbe underway. The term "underway" means that the first vessel 1310 is making its way over the bottom under its own power or under the power of another vessel. However, the first vessel 1310 can be in motion with respect to shore 1302 even though it is not underway. The first vessel 1310 can be in motion with respect to shore 1302 while moored, anchored, or drifting.<br>
[0174]   As discussed above, the first vessel 1310 includes a means for mixing the concentrate. As described above in greater derail, :he mixing means is operable to dilute the concentrate. Also as described abcve in greater detail, the mixing means is operable to regulate a temperature of the concentrate to a temperature substantially equal to that of the water proximate to the first vessel 1310.<br>
[0175]   In an embodiment, the concentrate discharged by the first vessel 1310 to the surrounding body of water has substantially the same temperature as the water surrounding the first vessel 1310. In another embodiment, the diluted concentrate discharged by the first vessel 1310 to the surrounding body of water has a level of total dissolved solids between the level of total dissolved solids of the concentrate produced by the permeate producing means and the total dissolved solids of the surrounding body of water. As used herein, the term "substantially equaT does not refer to a comparison of quantitative measurements, but rather that the impact on the affected marine life or ecosystem is qualitatively negligible. Thus, in an ernbodiment little or no readily observable adverse environmental effects occur when discharging the concentrate directly to the waters surrounding the first vessel 1310. Other suitable structures and mixing means may be used.<br>
[0176]   In one embodiment, the permeate delivering means comprises a second vessel 1320. A dead-weight tonnage of the second vessel 1320 is in a range between about 10,000 and 500,000 tons. In one embodiment, the second vessel 1320 includes a tug-barge unit. In another embodiment, the second vessel 1320 includes a converted single or double hull tanker.<br>
[0177] Generally, the first vessel 1310. is operable to transfer the permeate to the second vessel 1320 and the second vessel 1320 is operable to receive the permeate from the first vessel 1310. As will be described in more detail below, the^second<br>
vessel 1320 is operable to deliver the permeate to the land-based distribution system 1330. Transferring fluid, typically fuel oil, between sea-going vessels is known. The transfer of permeate, i.e., desalinated water, between the first and second vessels 1310, 1320 utilizes similar principles. However, in stark contrast to transferring fuel oil between vessels, the environmental consequences of a damaged, severed, or disconnected transfer line 1315 transferring desalinated water are negligible. [0178]    In one embodiment, a transfer line 1315 communicates the desalinated water between the first and second vessels 1310,1320. The transfer line 1315 can communicate a permeate storage compartment internal to the first vessel 1310 with a permeate storage compartment internal to the second vessel 1320. Support vessels (not shown) can be used as needed to facilitate the transfer of desalinated water between the first and second vessels 1310,1320.<br>
[0179]   Generally, the transfer of permeate between the first and second vessels 1310,1320 can be performed while both first and second vessels 1310, 1320 are in motion with respect to shore 1302. Alternatively, the transfer of permeate between the first and second vessels 1310,1320 can be performed while both first and second vessels 1310,1320 are moored or anchored. The first vessel 1310 is operable to continue producing permeate while the first and second vessels 1310,1320 are transferring permeate.<br>
[0180]   When the transfer of permeate between the first and second vessels 1310, 1320 is complete, the second vessel 1320 can transfer the permeate to the land-based distribution system 1330 located on shore 1302 or can transfer the permeate to a third vessel (not pictured) wherein the third vessel is permanently located at the pier 1331 or wharf (not shown), quay (not shown) or dolphins (not shown). In an embodiment, the second vessel 1320 travels to and is secured to a pier 1331. The permeate is transferred to a piping system 1332 from the second vessel 1320 or a third vessel disposed proximate the pier 1331. The piping system 1332 is in communication with and transfers the permeate to the land-based distribution system 1330. [0181]   The land-based distribution system 1330 generally includes at least one water storage tank 1333, a pumping station 1336, and a pipeline or a pipeline network 1335. In one embodiment, the land-based distribution system can include a plurality of tanks 1333 located in a single tank-farn be distributed over several locations on shore 1302. The pipeline network 1335 can interconnect the plurality of tanks 1333. Additionally, the pipeline network 1335 can communicate the water supply with<br>
individual pumping stations (not shown) and/or end-users (not shown), such as industrial or residential users.<br>
[0182]    In one embodiment, the land-based distribution system 1330 can include a chemical feed station (not shown) to adjust a plurality of water quality parameters. The chemical feed station can adjust water quality parameters such as pH, corrosion control, and fluoridation, as desired. Other suitable water quality parameters can be adjusted by the chemical feed station. In one embodiment, the chemical feed station is disposed upstream of the storage tanks 1333. In another embodiment, the chemical feed station is disposed downstream of the chemical feed station and upstream of the pumping station 1336. Alternatively, the chemical feed station can be disposed in other suitable locations.<br>
[0183]    In an altemate embodiment, the permeate can be transferred from the second vessel 1320 to a land-based transportation system (not shown) for delivery directly to end-users or alternate water storage facilities. The land-based transportation system car;include a plurality of tank trucks or a trucking network (not shown). The land-based transportation system can include a railroad or a railroad network. Additionally, the land-based transportation system can include a combination of a<br>
trucking network and a railroad network.<br>
/-<br>
[0184]      Referring now to Figure 14, an alternate permeate delivering means is shown. In one embodiment, the permeate can be transferred directly from the first vessel 1310 to a floating pipeline 1415. Floating pipelines to transfer oil are known. The floating pipeline 1415 can be similar in design to such floating pipelines. [0185]    The floating pipeline 1415 can be coupled to a permanent buoy 1404. The floating pipeline 1415 can be transported from shore 1302 to the buoy 1404 by a tugboat or other service vessel. The floatingpipeline 1415 can be constructed of known buoyant materials or can be coupled with buoyant floats (not shown) disposed along its length. The floating pipeline 1415 can float on the surface of the water 1303. Alternatively, the floating pipeline 1415 can be partially submerged below the surface of the water 1303.<br>
[0186]      An alternate embodiment of the permeate delivering means includes a sea-floor stabilized pipeline (not shown). The sea-floor stabilized pipeline can be coupled to the permanent buoy 1404. The sea-floor stabilized pipeline is disposed primarily below the surface of the water 1303 and rests on the sea-floor. The sea-floor stabilized pipeline can have a plurality of weights distributed over its length to keep it<br>
generally in place. Alternatively, the sea-floor stabilized pipeline can be securely fixed to the sea-floor with known anchorage devices and methods. (0187]    A first end of the sea-floor stabilized pipeline can be disposed above the surface of the water 1303. The first end of the sea-floor stabilized pipeline is in communication with first vessel 1310. A second end of the sea-floor stabilized pipeline can be disposed proximate to the land-based distribution system 1330. In one embodiment, a portion of the sea-floor stabilized pipeline proximate to the first end passes through the permanent buoy 1404. In another embodiment, a portion of the sea-floor stabilized pipeline proximate to the first end is integral with tbe permanent buoy 1404.<br>
[0188]    Another alternate embodiment of the permeate delivering means includes a sea-floor embedded pipeline (not shown). The sea-floor embedded pipeline can be coupled to the permanent buoy 1404. The sea-floor stabilized pipeline is disposed primarily below the surface of the sea-floor. The sea-floor embedded pipeline is generally secured in place by the sea-floor. The sea-floor embedded pipeline can be buried several inches-below a surface of tbe sea-floor. Alternatively, anchorage devices can be used to secure the sea-floor embedded pipeline. In another embodiment, tbe sea-floor embedded pipeline can be covered by various materials. Other structures and permeate delivering means may be used in other embodiments. [0189]    In one embodiment of the system 1301, the first vessel 1310 includes a packaging system (not shown) to package the permeate. The packaging system can include an on-board bottling plant. Alternatively, the packaging system can include other suitable packages, such as, for example, large plastic bladders. As described in more detail below, the packaged permeate can be transported to provide relief to a disaster stricken area on shore 1302. In addition to providing packaged desalinated water, tbe first vessel 1310 can include a store of disaster-relief provisions, such as food, medical supplies, and clothing.<br>
[0190]    To support the operation of the first vessel 1310, a support fleet (not shown) can be included Tbe support fleet is operable to provide tbe first vessel 1310 with one or more of the following: fuel oil, supplies and provisions, repair and replacement materials and equipment, personnel, and airlift capabilities. The support fleet can include a single vessel or a plurality of vessels.<br>
[0191]    Referring now to Figure 15, a system 1501 for providing disaster relief services from a maritime environment according to the present invention is shown.<br>
The system 1501 described in further detail below is operable to provide critical aid to a wide variety of areas that lack sophisticated, well-developed, or functional ground infrastructure. Additionally, tbe system 1501 does not leave a "footprint" on shore 1302. Furthermore, the system 1501 is mobile and can respond to developing crises without much lead time or notice. This is especially true when the system 1501 is forward-deployed across the globe.<br>
[0192]   Tbe system 1501 includes a first vessel 1510 operable to produce desalinated water. Generally, die first vessel 1510 is operable to produce desalinated water at a rate in a range between approximately 1 million gallons per day and approximately 100 million gallons per day. Typically the first vessel 1510 includes a reverse osmosis system. In one embodiment, the first vessel 1510 is operable to produce the desalinated water substantially continuously.<br>
[0193]    The first vessel 1510 can include a converted single-hull tanker and includes a first dead weight tonnage. The first dead weight tonnage includes a range between about 10,000 and 500,000 tons. In another embodiment, the first vessel 1510 has a dwt of between about 30,000 and 50,000. In another embodiment, the first vessel 1510 has a dwt of between about 65,000 and 80,000. In another embodiment, the vessel 1510 has a dwt of between about 120,000. In another embodiment, the first vessel 1510 has a dwt of between about 250,000 and 300,000. In other embodiments, the size of the first vessel 1510 may depend on the intended application, the controlling draft, and on the desired production capacity of the vessel. [0194]    The first vessel 1510 can be in continuous motion with respect to shore 1502. Generally, while the first vessel 1510 is in motion with respect to shore 1502, the first vessel 1510 can intake seawater 1503 to process through the reverse osmosis system. Alternatively, through the use of intake pumps and other known means, the first vessel 1510 can intake seawater 1503 while not in motion with respect to shore 1502.<br>
[0195]    To be in motion with respect to shore 1502, the first vessel 1510 can be underway. However, the first vessel 1510 can be in motion with respect to shore 1502 even though it is not underway. The first vessel 1510 can be in motion with respect to shore 1502 while moored, anchored, or drifting. [0196]    In one embodiment of the system 1501, the first vessel 1510 includesa packaging system (not shown) to package the desalinated water. The packaging system can include an on-board bottling plant Alternatively, the packaging can<br>
include other suitable packages, such as, for example, large plastic bladders. The packaged permeate can be transported to shore 1502 to provide relief to a disaster stricken area. In addition to providing packaged desalinated water, the first vessel 1510 can include a store of disaster-relief provisions, such as food, medical supplies, and clothing.<br>
[0197)   The system 1501 also includes a means for delivering the desalinated water to shore 1502. In one embodiment, the delivering means includes a second vessel 1520. The second vessel 1520 includes a second tonnage in a range between about 10,000 and 500,000 dwt The second vessel 1520 can include a converted single-hull tanker. The second vessel 1520 can also include a tug-barge unit Alternatively, other suitable vessels can be used.<br>
[0198]    The second vessel 1520 is operable to receive the desalinated water from the first vessel 1510 and to deliver the desalinate water to shore 1502. As described in detail above, the first vessel 1510 can transfer the desalinated water to the second vessel 1520 by a transfer line 1515. Accordingly, this transfer process will not be repeated here. The second vessel 1520 is operable to receive the desalinated water from the first vessel 1510 while the first and second vessels 1510, 1520 are in motion with respect to shore 1502.<br>
[0199]   In an alternate embodiment, unprocessed or partially-processed raw water may bo delivered from shore 1502 by, for example, the second vessel 1520 to the first vessel 1510 for processing or additional processing (i.e., refreshing the raw water). The water from the second vessel 1520 may be transferred to the first vessel 1510 by reversing the transfer process described above. Once the first vessel 1510 has processed or "refreshed" the water from ashore, the first vessel 1510 can transfer the desalinated or "refreshed" water to the second vessel 1520 for delivery to shore 1502. [0200]   Once the desired amount of desalinated water has been transferred from the first vessel 1510 to the second vessel 1520, the second vessel 1520 can transport the desalinated water proximate to the shore 1502. Typically, the second vessel 1520 will dock alongside a pier 1530. Alternatively, the second vessel 1520 can be an amphibious vehicle, in which case the second vessel 1520 can deliver the desalinated water directly to shore 1502. In yet another alternative embodiment, the first vessel 1510 or the second vessel 1520 can transfer packaged desalinated water to shore 1502 by off-loading the packaged water at the pier 1530 or dropping the packaged water overboard allowing the tide to carry the packaged water in to shore 1502.<br>
[0201]    In an alternate embodiment, the delivering means includes an airborne delivery system (not shown). The airborne delivery system is operable to transport needed aid faster and farther inland than conventional ground transportation means. Furthermore, some areas on shore 1502 may be accessible only by air. [0202]    In one embodiment, the airborne delivery system includes a helicopter (not shown). The helicopter can land on or hover above the first vessel 1510 or the second vessel 1520. The helicopter can be loaded with packaged water or it can transport pallets of the packaged water. In another embodiment, the airborne delivery system includes a seaplane. The seaplane can be directly loaded with packaged water and transport the packaged water inland to where it is needed. Other structures and delivery means may be used in other embodiments.<br>
[0203]   The system 1501 can provide other disaster relief services in addition to delivering desalinated water. As discussed above, the system 1501 can also provide food (such as, for example Meals Ready to Eat - MREs), medical supplies, and clothing. As discussed above, the system 1501 can include a support fleet (not shown) operable to provide the first vessel 1510 with one or more of the following: fuel, supplies and provisions, repair and replacement materials and equipment, personnel, and airlift capabilities. The support fleet can include a single vessel or a plurality of vessels. Furthermore, in addition to supporting the first vessel 1510, the support fleet can dispatch emergency personnel and additional emergency aid to shore 1502.<br>
[0204]    Referring now to Figure 16, a system 1601 for mitigating environmental impacts of a water purification system of a vessel 1610 on a maritime environment is shown. The water purification system (not shown) produces a permeate and a concentrate. The water purification system can be similar to that as described above. Altemativery, other suitable water purification systems can be used. Typically, the permeate produced includes desalinated water and the concentrate produced includes a brine.<br>
[0205]    In an embodiment, the system 1601 includes a mixing means for controlling the level of total dissolved solids of the concentrate discharged from the vessel 1610 into the surrounding body of water. As described above in greater detail, the mixing means is operable to dilute the concentrate and/or to regulate the temperature of the concentrate discharged from the vessel 1610.<br>
[0206]    In one embodiment, the system 1601 includes means for discharging the concentrate. Generally, the concentrate discharging means is operable to mix the concentrate with raw water prior to the discharge of concentrate to the surrounding body of water. In another embodiment, the concentrate discharging means is operable to mix the concentrate with water having a total dissolved solids below the level of total dissolved solids of the surrounding body of water prior to discharge. The concentrate discharging means can be similar to that described above. [0207]   In one embodiment, the concentrate discharging means includes a grate or other dispersing device. For example, the grate can include a plurality of divergently-oriented apertures. In another example, the grate can include a plurality of protrusions disposed in the plurality of apertures. The grate can be configured as described above and with reference to Figures 5A and 5B. Alternatively, the grating can be configured in other alternate means.<br>
[0208]   In another embodiment, the concentrate dispersing means includes a discharge member extending from the vessel and a plurality of orifices disposed in the discharge member. The discharge member can include a plurality of discharge tubes, each one of the tubes extending to a different depth. The discharge member can include a floating hose, which generally extends from the main deck of the vessel and into the water. The discharge member can also include a catenary. Other alternate dispersing means can be as that described above. Other suitable structures and dispersing means can be used.<br>
[0209]    In one embodiment, the system 1601 includes means for reducing a level of shipboard noise. For example, the noise reducing means includes a plurality of piping encasements. In another example, the noise reducing means includes a plurality of vibration dampening elements. Other systems for mitigating environmental impacts of a desalination system of a vessel on a maritime environment can be similar to those systems, apparatus, and methods described above. Alternatively, other suitable structures, systems, and means can be used.<br>
[0210]   Referring now to Figure 17, a system 1701 for producing and transferring energy to a land-based distribution system is shown. The system 1701 comprises a vessel 1710. The vessel 1710 comprises means for producing energy 1703. The system 1701 also comprises a land-based means 1720 for transferring the energy from the vessel 1710 to a land-based distribution system 1740. hi one embodiment, a<br>
capacity of the energy producing means 1703 comprises a range between about 10 megawatts and 100 megawatts.<br>
[0211]    In one embodiment, the vessel 1710 comprises a dead-weight tonnage in a range between approximately 10,000 and 500,000. As described above, the vessel 1710 can be a reconfigured single-hull tanker. Other suitable vessels can be reconfigured, such as barges and other merchant vessels and retired (mothballed) naval vessels. Alternatively, the vessel 1710 can be custom built, i.e., designed and built especially for a particular application.<br>
[0212]    In one embodiment, the energy producing means 1703 comprises a supply transformer (not shown), a motor (not shown), a frequency converter (not shown), and a motor control (not shown). The frequency converter is operable to control a speed and a torque of the motor. Preferably tbe energy producing means 1703 comprises an electric drive propulsion drive, which is known in the art. Generally, the transformer is in communication with tbe motor and tbe frequency converter. Typically, the motor control is in communication with tbe transformer, the motor, and the frequency converter. The motor can be a drive motor or an electric motor generator. [0213]    Typically, the energy producing means 1703 is disposed entirely below the main deck. In an alternate embodiment, the energy producing means 1703 can be disposed on and above the main deck, as well as below the main deck. Moreover, the energy producing means 1703 can be supplemented by temporary electrical generators (not shown), such as, for example, diesel generators. [0214]    Preferably, the motor is an AC motor. The speed of the motor can be controlled by varying the voltage and frequency of its supply. The frequency converter is operable to create a variable frequency output. The frequency converter can also provide stepless control of three-phase AC currents from zero to maximum output frequency, corresponding to a desired shaft speed both ahead and astern. In another embodiment, the energy producing means comprises a fuel cell (not shown). Alternatively, other suitable energy producing means can be used, such as, for example, conventional maritime diesel engines, or nuclear or fossil-fueled steam plants.<br>
[0215]    The energy transferring means 1720 comprises means for synchronizing 1725 the energy from the vessel 1710 to tbe land-based distribution system 1740. As described above, the energy transferring means 1720 is a land-based, or shore-based, system. Utilizing a land-based energy transferring means 1720 rather than a ship-<br>
board energy transferring means allows the vessel 1710 to maximize its limited space for energy generation, and other additional functions. Additionally, a land-based energy transferring means 1720 is configured by the local energy authority to connect to the land-based distribution system 1740. Thus, the vessel 1710 would not have to be modified to accommodate variations among different grid systems. [0216J    In one embodiment, the synchronizing means 1725 comprises a generator step-up transformer (not shown) and a second converter (not shown). The generator step-up transformer is operable to step up a voltage from the vessel 1710 to a voltage substantially equal to the land-based distribution system 1740. For example, the generator step-up transformer can step-up the voltage from the vessel 1710, Le., 600 V, to 38 kV, the voltage of the land-based distribution system 1740. In another example, the generator step-up transformer can step-up the voltage from the vessel 1710, i.e., 600 V, to 69 kV, the voltage of the land-based distribution system 1740. [0217]    The second converter is operable to synchronize the energy from the vessel 1710 with the land-based distribution system 1740. For example, the second converter can convert DC power from the vessel 1710 to the AC power of the land-based distribution system 1740. As another example, the second converter can convert the phase of the power from the vessel 1710 to the phase of the power in the land-based distribution system 1740.<br>
[0218]    The land-based distribution system 1740 can include an electrical grid or network to supply and transport electrical energy to commercial, industrial, and/or residential end-users. Such a land-based distribution system 1740 generally includes, but is not limited to, transmission towers, overhead and underground power lines, substations, transformers, converters, and wires, such as service drops. Alternatively, other suitable land-based distribution systems can be used. [0219]   In an embodiment, the vessel 1710 comprises means for cleaning exhaust 1707. Typically, exhaust refers to pollutants, as well as various particulates. The exhaust cleaning means 1707 is disposed upstream, or before the egress of exhaust from the vessel 1710. Exhaust from the vessel generally is produced in generating power. Of course, auxiliary ship-board functions may produce some additional exhaust In one embodiment, the exhaust cleaning means 1707 comprises a scrubber. In another embodiment, the exhaust cleaning means 1707 comprises a particulate filter.<br>
[0220]    Referring now to Figure 18, a system 1801 is shown. The system 1801 comprises a vessel 1810 operable to produce desalinated water and electricity. The system 1801 also includes means for delivering (not shown) the desalinated water from the vessel 1810 to a land-based water distribution system 1830 and means for transferring 1820 the electricity from the vessel 1810 to the land-based electrical distribution system 1840.<br>
[0221]   In one embodiment, the vessel 1810 comprises a dead-weight tonnage in a range between about 10,000 and 500,000. As described above, the vessel 1810 can be a reconfigured single-hull tanker. Other suitable vessels can be reconfigured, such as barges and other merchant vessels. Alternatively, the vessel 1810 can be custom-made for this particular application.<br>
[0222]    Generally, the vessel 1810 is operable to produce desalinated water in a range between about 1 million gallons per day and 100 million gallons per day. Typically, the vessel 1810 produces desalinated water as described above, and thus, will not be repeated here. Alternatively, other suitable means of producing desalinated water can be used. Generally, a capacity of the vessel 1810 for producing electricity is in a range between about 10 megawatts and 100 megawatts. [0223]    While the vessel 1810 is producing desalinated water, the vessel 1810 generally is off-shore 1803. When the vessel 1810 has produced its capacity of desalinated water - or when the vessel 1810 has produced as much as is desired or needed - the vessel 1810 heads to shore 1802 and is secured to or moored proximate to a pier 1831. Delivery or discharge of the desalinated water to the land-based distribution system 1830 can take about 12 hours, which, of course, can vary depending on the amount of water to be delivered from the vessel 1810. [0224]    In one embodiment, the means for delivering the desalinated water from the vessel 1810 to the land-based water distribution system 1830 includes a piping system 1832. Alternatively, other suitable embodiments can be used. The piping system 1832 is in communication with the land-based water distribution system 1830. [0225]   The land-based water distribution system 1830 generally includes at least one water storage tank 1833, a pumping station 1836, and a pipeline or a pipeline network 1835. In one embodiment, the land-based distribution system can include a plurality of tanks 1833 located in a single tank-farm or be distributed over several locations on shore 1802. The pipeline network 1835 can interconnect the plurality of tanks 1833. Additionally, the pipeline network 1835 can communicate the water<br>
supply with individual pumping stations (not shown) and/or end-users (not shown), such as industrial or residential users.<br>
[0226]   In one embodiment, the land-based water distribution system 1830 can include a chemical feed station (not shown) to adjust a plurality of water quality parameters.

In another embodiment, the chemical feed station is disposed downstream of the chemical feed station and upstream of tbe pumping station 1836. Alternatively, the chemical feed station can be disposed in other suitable locations.<br>
[0227]   In an alternate embodiment, the desalinated water can be transferred from die vessel 1810 to a land-based transportation system (not shown) for delivery directly to end-users or alternate water storage facilities. The land-based transportation system can include a plurality of tank trucks or a trucking network (not shown). The land-based transportation system can include a railroad or a railroad network. Additionally, the land-based transportation system can include a combination of a trucking network and a railroad network.<br>
[0228]   While the vessel 1810 is delivering the desalinated water to a land-based wateT distribution system 1830, the vessel 1810 can generate electricity for transfer to a shore-based electrical distribution system 1840. Generally, one megawatt is sufficient to provide power to 1000 typical American homes. Thus, where the capacity of the vessel 1810 is 100 megawatts, the vessel 1810 can provide power to about 100,000 homes. In addition to providing desalinated water, the vessel 1810 can provide criticalry-need power to help alleviate suffering in disaster-stricken areas by providing power to hospitals and other emergency infrastructure, as well as to homes. [0229]   m one embodiment, the vessel 1810 comprises a supply transfonner (not shown), a motor (not shown), a frequency converter (not shown), and a motor control (not shown). The frequency converter is operable to control a speed and a torque of the motor.<br>
[0230]   Preferably the supply transformer, the motor, the frequency converter, and the motor control comprise an electric generating means 1803. Generally, the transformer is in communication with the motor and the frequency converter.<br>
Typically, the motor control is in communication with the transformer, the motor, and the frequency converter.<br>
[0231]   Typically, the electric generating means 1803 is disposed entirely below the main deck. In an alternate embodiment, the electric generating means 1803 can be disposed on and/or above the main deck, as well as below the main deck. Moreover, the electric generating means 1803 can be supplemented by temporary electrical generators (not shown), such as, for example, diesel generators. [0232]   Preferably, the motor is an AC motor. The speed of the motor can be controlled by varying the voltage and frequency of its supply. The frequency converter is operable to create a variable frequency output The frequency converter can also provide stepless control of three-phase AC currents from zero to maximum output frequency, corresponding to a desired shaft speed bom ahead and astern. In another embodiment, the electric generating means 1803 comprises a fuel cell (not shown). Alternatively, other suitable energy producing means can be used, such as, for example, conventional maritime diesel engines.<br>
[0233]   The energy transferring means 1820 comprises means for syrwhronizing 1825 the energy from the vessel 1810 to the land-based distribution system 1840. As described above, the energy transferring means 1820 is a land-based, or shore-based, system.<br>
[0234]    In one embodiment, the synchronizing means 1825 comprises a generator step-up transformer (not shown) and a second converter (not shown). The generator step-up transformer is operable to step up a voltage from the vessel 1810 to a voltage substantially equal to the land-based distribution system 1840. For example, the generator step-up transfonner can step-up the voltage from the vessel 1810, Le., 600 V, to 38 kV, the voltage of the land-based distribution system 1840. In another example, the generator step-up transformer can step-up the voltage from the vessel 1810, i.e., 600 V, to 69 kV, the voltage of the land-based distribution system 1840. [0235]   The second converter is operable to synchronize the energy from the vessel 1810 with the land-based distribution system 1840. For example, the second converter can convert DC power from the vessel 1810 to the AC power of the land-based distribution system 1840. As another example, the second converter can convert the phase of the power from the vessel 1810 to the phase of the power in the land-based distribution system 1840.<br>
[0236]    In an embodiment, the vessel 1810 comprises means for cleaning exhaust 1807. Typically, exhaust refers to pollutants, as well as various particulates.

Of course, auxiliary ship-board functions may produce some additional exhaust In one embodiment, the exhaust cleaning means 1807 comprises a scrubber. In another embodiment, the exhaust cleaning means 1807 comprises a particulate filter.<br>

Generally, the first surface 1902a of the hull 1902 comprises an interior surface of the vessel 1901 and the second surface 1902b of the hull 1902 comprises an exterior surface of the vessel 1902. The vessel 1901 also comprises means for producing desalinated water (not shown) and means for mixing a concentrate with seawater (not shown). The mixing means and the means for producing desalinated water include the structures and methods described above for producing desalinated water. As shown in Figure 19A, the means for producing desalinated water includes the plurality of reverse osmosis systems 1904 installed in separate containers disposed on and above the main deck 1905 of the vessel 1901. Alternatively, other suitable means for producing desalinated water can be used. [0238]    The vessel 1901 also includes means for storing the desalinated water. The water storing means comprises a tank 1903 disposed within the hull 1902. The tank 1903 can occupy a majority of the volume formed by the hull 1902 below the main deck 1905 of the vessel 1901. Alternatively, the tank 1903 can occupy other suitable volumes, and be disposed in suitable configurations. The tank 1903 comprises a first surface 1903a and a second surface 1903b. In a preferred embodiment, the tank 1903 is disposed within a double-hull of the vessel 1901. In another embodiment, the tank 1903 forms a double-hull of the vessel 1901.

the tank 1903 is separated from the first surface 1902a of the hull 1902 by a distance. Typically, the distance between the second surface 1903b of the tank 1903 and the first surface 1902a of the hull 1902 is greater than or equal to about two meters. In another embodiment, the distance between the second surface 1903b of the tank 1903 and the first surface 1902a of the hull 1902 is less than about two meters. Alternatively, other suitable distances can be used.<br>

The method 1701 may be employed to deliver desalinated water to a land-based distribution system, such as for example, the system 1330 shown in Figure 13 and as described above. Items shown in Figure 13 are referred to in describing Figures 17A-17C to aid understanding of the embodiment of the method 1701 shown. However, embodiments of methods according to the present invention may be employed in a wide variety of other systems.<br>
[0250]    Referring now to Figure 20A, block 2010 indicates that a first vessel is provided. The first vessel can be similar to that described above. In one embodiment, the first vessel includes a converted single-hull tanker having a dead-weight tonnage in a range between about 10,000 tons and 500,000 tons. In another embodiment, the first vessel has a dwt of between about 30,000 and 50,000. In another embodiment, the first vessel 1710 has a dwt of between about 65,000 and 80,000. In another embodiment, the first vessel has a dwt of between about 120,000. In another embodiment, the first vessel has a dwt of between about 250,000 and 300,000. In other embodiments, the size of the first vessel will depend on the intended application, the maximum draft to keep the vessel afloat, and on the desired production capacity of the vessel. Alternatively, other suitable vessels can be used. [0251]    The first vessel is operable to produce a permeate and to mix a concentrate. As described herein, the permeate is produced from raw water, typically seawater. The permeate generally includes desalinated water and the concentrate includes a brine. In one embodiment, the method 2001 includes providing a reverse osmosis system. Typically, a rate of production of the permeate by the first vessel is in a range between approximately 1 million gallons per day and approximately 100 million gallons per day. In another embodiment, the first vessel is in continuous motion with respect to shore. In another embodiment, the first vessel is fixed with respect to shore. As described in more detail herein, one embodiment of the method 2001 includes diluting the concentrate to a level substantially equal to a salinity level of water proximate to the first vessel.<br>
[0252]    Referring again to Figure 20A, block 2020 indicates that the permeate is delivered from the first vessel to a land-based distribution system. Referring now to Figure 20B, one embodiment for delivering the permeate from the first vessel to the land-based distribution system is shown. Block 2022 indicates that the step for delivering the permeate from the first vessel to the land-based distribution system includes transferring permeate from the first vessel to a second vessel. [0253]     In another embodiment, the method 2001 can include packaging the permeate. The permeate can be packaged as described above with reference to Figure 13. Alternatively, other methods of packaging the permeate can be used. Once packaged, the permeate can be transported to shore by various methods, including for example, airborne delivery means.

Transferring permeate between vessel can use similar principles.<br>
[0255]   As shown in Figure 20B, block 2024 indicates that the step for delivering the permeate from the first vessel to the land-based distribution system includes transporting the permeate disposed in the second vessel proximate to the land-based distribution system. The second vessel can travel to a pier or a dock proximate to the shore under its own power or with the assistance of a tug or other suitable support vessel.<br>
[0256]   As shown in Figure 20B, block 2026 indicates that the step for delivering the permeate from the first vessel to the land-based distribution system includes transferring the permeate from the second vessel to the land-based distribution system. The permeate can be transferred from the second vessel to the land-based distribution system, as described above and with reference to Figure 13.<br>
[0257]    Generally, the permeate is transferred from the second vessel to the land-based distribution system through a transfer line that is in communication with a storage tank intake pump. The storage tank intake pump assists in the transfer of penneate to a storage tank. Alternatively, other suitable methods of transferring the permeate from the second vessel to the land-based distribution system can be used. [0258]    Referring now to Figure 20C, an alternate embodiment for delivering the permeate from the first vessel to the land-based distribution system is shown.

The permeate can be transported in the pipeline similar to that described above with reference to Figure 13. Alternatively, other suitable methods of transporting the permeate can be used. Generally, a transfer pump coupled to the permanent buoy or the first vessel, provides the necessary pressure to transport the permeate proximate to shore. [0261]   In one embodiment, the method 2001 further comprises providing a storage tank. Generally, the storage tank is disposed on shore and stores the permeate for future transport and/or use. In one embodiment, there may be a plurality of storage tanks. In another embodiment, the method 501 further comprises communicating a pipeline or a pipeline network with the storage tank. In yet another embodiment, the method 1701 further includes communicating a pumping station with the pipeline or the pipeline network. Typically, a combination of a storage tank, a pipeline or a pipeline network in communication with the storage tank, and a pumping station in communication with the pipeline or the pipeline network comprises the land-based distribution system.

[0262]    In one embodiment, the method 2001 further comprises communicating a chemical feed station to the storage tank. The chemical feed station is operable to adjust a plurality of water quality parameters, such as, for example, pH, corrosion control, and fluoridation. The water can be transported to end-users, such as industrial or residential users, directly from the storage tank and pipeline network. Alternatively, the water can be transported by providing a land-based transportation system. In one embodiment, the land-based transportation system can include a railroad or a railroad network. In another embodiment, the land-based transportation system can include a tank truck or a trucking network.<br>

[0267]    As indicated by block 2120, the method 2101 of providing aid to a disaster-stricken area also includes delivering the desalinated water to shore. In one embodiment, the method 2101 includes providing a second vessel operable to receive the desalinated water from the first vessel and to deliver the desalinated water to shore. The second vessel includes a second tonnage. Typically, the second tonnage is less than the first tonnage. The second tonnage can be in a range between about 10,000 and 500,000 dwt Other suitable vessels can be used, such as those similar to that described above.<br>
[0268]    In one embodiment, the second vessel is operable to receive the desalinated water from the first vessel while the first and second vessels are in motion with respect to shore. Alternatively, the second vessel can receive the desalinated water from the first vessel while the first and second vessels are substantially stationary with respect to shore. The means of transferring desalinated water from the first vessel to the second vessel can be similar to float described above. Alternatively, other suitable means for transferring desalinated water between the first and second vessels can be used. Once the desired amount of desalinated water has been received by the second vessel, the second vessel can transport the desalinated water proximate to shore for distribution to the disaster-stricken area.<br>
[0269]    As disaster-stricken areas often lack or have compromised land-based distribution systems, an alternate method 2120 of delivering desalinated water to shore includes providing an airborne vehicle. Disaster-stricken areas are often accessible only by air. In one embodiment, the airborne vehicle includes a helicopter. In another embodiment, the airborne vehicle includes a seaplane. The airborne vehicle is operable to transport packaged desalinated water as well as the disaster-relief provisions. Other alternate methods of delivering the desalinated water include simply throwing packaged desalinated water overboard. The packaged water can float to shore or be collected by other vessels.<br>
[0270]    In the case of a helicopter, the helicopter is operable to transport several discrete packages or to transport pallets of the packaged desalinated water. In one embodiment, the first vessel can include a helipad to facilitate the flight operations and capabilities of the helicopter. Typically, there can be a plurality of airborne vehicles. The airborne vehicles can originate from shore or other vessels. [0271]    The method 2101 includes providing a plurality of support vessels. The support vessels are operable to provide the first vessel with one or more of the following: fuel, supplies and provisions, repair and replacement materials and equipment, personnel, and airlift capabilities.<br>
[0272]    Figure 22 shows an embodiment of a method 2201 according to the present invention. The method 2201 may be employed to mitigate environmental impacts of desalinating water. Items shown in Figure 16 are referred to in describing Figure 22 to aid understanding of the embodiment of the method 1901 shown. However, embodiments of methods according to the present invention may be employed in a wide variety of other systems.<br>
