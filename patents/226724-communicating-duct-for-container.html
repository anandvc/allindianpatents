COMMUNICATING DUCT FOR CONTAINERS<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a communicating duct<br>
for containers.<br>
The invention relates also to a container furnished<br>
with such a duct.<br>
In particular, albeit with no limitation in general<br>
scope implied, the present invention relates to a container<br>
for food products, for example containers designed to hold<br>
liquid products in general such as milk, fruit juices,<br>
yoghurt, mineral water, and/or fluid products broadly<br>
considered, of which the chemical and organoleptic<br>
properties can easily be impaired and spoiled.<br>
Background Art<br>
Liquid and fluid products of the type mentioned above<br>
are packaged conventionally by bottling in containers of<br>
which the structure can be fabricated employing a multi-<br>
layer or treated paper material, for example cardboard or<br>
paperboard coated with one or more layers of food-safe<br>
material suitable for liquids.<br><br>
Containers of the type in question are fashioned<br>
generally from flat diecut blanks, detached generally<br>
from a roll and then folded suitably along precreased<br>
lines in such a way as to form recipients capable of<br>
holding the liquid product.<br>
It is standard practice for a communicating duct<br>
embodied typically as a tubular element to be applied<br>
to the top of each container, providing a spout from<br>
which to pour the product; the end of the tubular<br>
element farthest from the container can be closed by<br>
means of a suitable cap.<br>
The communicating duct is secured to the structure<br>
of the respective container by means of a weld, such<br>
as will unite the topmost edges of the container<br>
structure with a cylindrical portion of the tubular<br>
element constituting the duct as disclosed by<br>
document US 5088642.<br>
To ensure the communicating ducts are correctly<br>
positioned on the respective containers, each duct is<br>
furnished with an annular projection serving to<br>
delimit the weldable surface of the tubular element<br>
uppermost, and affording a stop against which the top<br>
edge of the container structure is caused to locate.<br>
Still with reference to the positioning of the<br>
communicating ducts on the structures of the relative<br>
containers, each communicating duct is furnished<br>
generally with one or more projections positioned to<br>
locate between joined areas of the container in such<br>
a way that each projection will be united with the<br>
selfsame joined areas in the course of the welding<br>
operation.<br><br>
Moreover, the welding operations in question<br>
typically involve the application of heat, and in<br>
order to offset any contraction of the material used<br>
to fashion the communicating duct, the longitudinal<br>
dimension presented by the tubular element of the<br>
duct is greater than the effective longitudinal<br>
dimension of the weldable surface, projecting<br>
internally of and toward the bottom of the container.<br>
Whilst the communicating ducts thus described<br>
afford a protected passage to the food product, it<br>
has been found nonetheless that they are not free of<br>
drawbacks and might be improved from certain<br>
standpoints, as concerning principally the chemical<br>
and organoleptic preservation of the bottled food<br>
product, the fluid-tightness of the welded areas by<br>
which the communicating ducts and the respective<br>
containers are united, and the simplicity of the<br>
welding operations.<br>
More exactly, it has been found that an excessive<br>
oversizing of the tubular element, intended to offset<br>
the contraction of the material during the welding<br>
operation, results in the formation of hollow<br>
retention pockets between the walls of the container<br>
and the innermost end of the spout afforded by the<br>
tubular element. These pockets are particularly<br>
disadvantageous in that they complicate the process<br>
of cleaning the inside of the containers after the<br>
welding operation, as well as degrading the operation<br>
of disposal when the containers are no longer of use.<br>
During the washing process, in effect, which is<br><br>
conducted generally with the container sealed and<br>
using a special flushing liquid, it happens that a<br>
part of the liquid will collect in the aforementioned<br>
pockets when the container is emptied. "Naturally<br>
enough, the presence of the flushing liquid inside<br>
the container implies that the food product batched<br>
subsequently into the selfsame container will become<br>
tainted. Accordingly, the manufacturer is forced to<br>
make use of devices designed especially to remove the<br>
residual cleansing liquid. This obviously dictates an<br>
increase in the costs of producing, and subsequently<br>
of marketing the end product.<br>
As regards disposal of the containers on the other<br>
hand, the pockets tend undesirably to trap a part of<br>
the liquid product used by the consumer, which can<br>
then escape accidentally both when the container is<br>
placed in the refuse collection bin, and during the<br>
operations of crushing and compacting thereafter.<br>
Moreover, the structure of prior art communicating<br>
ducts as described above does nothing to facilitate<br>
the welding process, given that, one or more gaps can<br>
form subsequently between the external cylindrical<br>
surface of the tubular element and the flat walls of<br>
the relative container, tending thus to impede a<br>
proper isolation of the bottled product from the<br>
surrounding environment.<br>
The object of the present invention is to overcome<br>
the problems described above through the adoption of<br>
a communicating duct for containers that can both<br>
guarantee a fluid-tight seal and ensure there will be<br><br>
no stagnation in the container either of flushing<br>
liquids, after the cleansing operation, or of liquid<br>
food products when poured for consumption.<br>
A further object of the invention is to simplify<br>
the operations by which the communicating duct and<br>
the relative container are joined together.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
The stated object is realized according to the<br>
present invention in a communicating duct for<br>
containers, comprising at least one tubular element<br>
anchorable to an outlet portion of a container in<br>
such a way as to create at least one spout affording<br>
a passage between the container and the surrounding<br>
environment, and at least one connecting portion<br>
presenting at least one connecting area such as can<br>
be united hermetically with the outlet portion of the<br>
container, characterized in that the connecting<br>
portion presents an internal bridging surface<br>
departing from the outlet portion and converging<br>
toward a longitudinal axis of the tubular element<br>
(2) .<br>
The stated object is realized similarly in a<br>
container fashioned from at least one sheet of paper<br>
material, comprising a structure composed of at least<br>
one base portion, at least one outlet portion<br>
permanently associated and combining with the base<br>
portion to afford at least one cavity containing at<br>
least one food product, and at least one<br>
communicating duct anchorable to a outlet portion of<br><br>
the container in such a way as to create at least one<br>
spout affording a passage between the cavity and the<br>
surrounding environment, characterized in that the<br>
communicating duct embodies the features recited in<br>
one or more of the appended claims 1 to 18 relating<br>
to the selfsame communicating duct.<br>
The invention will now be described in detail, by<br>
way of example, with the aid of the accompanying<br>
drawings, in which:<br>
-figure 1 illustrates a first embodiment of a<br>
communicating duct for containers according to the<br>
present invention, associated with a portion of a<br>
respective container and viewed in perspective;<br>
-figure 2 shows the communicating duct of figure 1<br>
viewed in plan;<br>
-figure 3 is a half-section of the duct illustrated<br>
in figures 1 and 2, taken on III-III in figure 2;<br>
-figure 4 shows the communicating duct of figures 1,<br>
2 and 3, associated with a container for liquid food<br>
products and viewed in a diametral section;<br>
-figure 5 illustrates a second embodiment of the<br>
communicating duct according to the invention, viewed<br>
in plan;<br>
-figure 6 is a half-section of the duct illustrated<br>
in figure 5, taken on IV-IV in figure 5.<br>
With reference to the drawings, 1 denotes a<br>
communicating duct for containers, in its entirety,<br>
embodied according to the present invention.<br>
The communicating duct 1 comprises at least one<br>
tubular element 2 anchorable to a structure 3 of a<br><br>
container 4 and serving thus to establish at least<br>
one spout 5 connecting the inside of the container<br>
with the surrounding environment.<br>
The container 4 is fashioned preferably from one or<br>
more blanks (not illustrated, being conventional) of<br>
a multi-layer paper material, for example paperboard<br>
or cardboard coated with one or more layers of a<br>
food-safe film at least on the surface exposed to the<br>
product.<br>
As illustrated partly by the phantom lines of<br>
figure 1, and in figure 4, the structure 3 of the<br>
container 4 comprises a substantially box-like base<br>
portion 6 rigidly associated uppermost with an outlet<br>
portion 7 of substantially frustopyramidal geometry,<br>
funnel-like in appearance. The base portion 6 and the<br>
outlet portion 7 combine to create at least one<br>
cavity 8 such as will contain a food product, and<br>
preferably a liquid food product.<br>
More exactly, the base portion 6 presents at least<br>
a base 6a of substantially polygonal outline and a<br>
plurality of substantially quadrangular side walls 6b<br>
departing one from each side of the base.<br>
The outlet portion 7 likewise presents a set of<br>
side walls 7a substantially of isosceles trapezoidal<br>
outline, extending diagonally from the relative side<br>
walls 6b of the base portion 6. Each side wall 7a of<br>
the output portion 7 is connected to the two adjacent<br>
side walls 7a by way of respective seams 7b bonded<br>
hermetically together through the agency of suitable<br>
means (not illustrated) to create respective joined<br><br>
areas 7c.<br>
In like manner, given that the structure 3 of the<br>
container 4 is erected from a blank of paper material, the<br>
base portion 6 also presents respective seams (not<br>
illustrated), longitudinally disposed and folded in such a<br>
manner as to lie flat against the respective side walls 6b,<br>
occupying a minimum of space.<br>
The side walls la of the outlet portion 7 are mutually<br>
convergent, centred on a longitudinal axis X of the<br>
container 4 and terminating uppermost in an opening 7d to<br>
which the communicating duct 1 can be anchored, so that the<br>
spout 5 created by the duct will afford a passage through<br>
which the cavity 8 and the surrounding environment are<br>
connected.<br>
As discernible in the accompanying drawings, the<br>
communicating duct 1 is anchorable to the outlet portion 7<br>
of the container 4 by way of a connecting portion 9 located<br>
at a bottom end 2a of the tubular element 2.<br>
In particular, the connecting portion 9 presents at<br>
least one connecting area 9a extending substantially<br>
parallel to the outlet portion 7 of the container 4 in such<br>
a way that it can be offered entirely flush and joined<br>
hermetically to the selfsame outlet portion.<br>
In the example of figures 1 and 4, the connecting area<br>
9a is anchored to the inside face of the outlet portion 7<br>
and thus concealed entirely.<br>
More precisely, the connecting area 9a presents a<br>
plurality of connecting surfaces 9b arranged around a<br>
longitudinal axis Y of the tubular element 2 which, when<br>
the communicating duct 1 is secured in place, will coincide<br><br>
with the longitudinal axis X of the container 4. Each<br>
connecting surface 9b is thus angled in relation to the<br>
longitudinal axis Y and extends between two adjacent<br>
connecting surfaces 9b.<br>
In practice, each connecting surface 9b engages a<br>
respective adjacent connecting surface 9b along one of two<br>
opposite side edges 9c, thereby establishing at least one<br>
corner edge 10 positioned facing a respective internal<br>
corner formed between two side walls 7a of the outlet<br>
portion 7 presented by the container 4.<br>
To ensure an optimum fluid-tight association between<br>
the communicating duct 1 and the container 4, the<br>
connecting surfaces 9b are equal in number to the side<br>
walls 7a of the outlet portion 7, hence also to the side<br>
walls 6b of the base portion 6 of the selfsame container 4.<br>
Moreover, each connecting surface 9b appears substantially<br>
flat and extends substantially parallel to the respective<br>
side wall 7a of the outlet portion 7, thus markedly<br>
facilitating a secure join between the two components.<br>
As discernible in figures 2 and 5, the connecting<br>
surfaces 9b are disposed in such a way as to describe a<br>
polygon, viewed in a plane substantially transverse to the<br>
longitudinal axis Y of the tubular element 2, which appears<br>
in the particular example illustrated as a square.<br><br>
Still referring to the transverse plane mentioned<br>
above, each connecting surface 9b of the connecting<br>
area 9a is set at an angle such as will render the<br>
connecting portion 9 substantially frustopryamidal in<br>
appearance. Given the geometry of the connecting<br>
portion 9, moreover, each connecting surface 9b<br>
presents a substantially trapezoidal outline similar<br>
to the outline presented by each side wall 7a of the<br>
outlet portion 7.<br>
The connecting portion 9 of the tubular element 2<br>
also presents a locating element 11 positioned<br>
transversely relative to the connecting area 9a and<br>
in such a way as to engage in abutting contact with a<br>
terminal edge 7d presented by the respective side<br>
wall 7a of the outlet portion 7.<br>
More exactly, each connecting surface 9b of the<br>
connecting area 9a presented by the connecting<br>
portion 9 is furnished with a respective locating<br>
element. 11 projecting from a top side of the relative<br>
connecting surface 9b and extending its full length,<br>
so that the locating element 11 of each connecting<br>
surface 9b is joined at the relative side edges 9c to<br>
the locating elements 11 of the adjacent connecting<br>
surfaces 9b.<br>
As discernible in the accompanying drawings, the<br>
connecting portion 9 of the tubular element 2<br>
presents at least one projection 12 extending<br>
radially from the connecting area 9a in relation to<br>
the longitudinal axis Y of the tubular element 2 and<br>
insertable hermetically between the two seams 7b of a<br><br>
corresponding joined area 7c presented by the outlet<br>
portion 7, in such a way as to form a single entity<br>
with the selfsame seams once the assembled components<br>
have been suitably welded together.<br>
In the examples illustrated, each corner edge 10 of<br>
the connecting portion 9 is furnished with a relative<br>
radially cantilevered projection 12 extending between<br>
the seams 7b of a respective joined area 7c of the<br>
outlet portion 7. The projections 12 present a<br>
substantially flat and slender profile such as will<br>
favour their insertion between the seams 7b of the<br>
outlet portion 7 and allow the seams to bond without<br>
difficulty during the welding operation.<br>
To advantage, the connecting portion 9 of the<br>
tubular element 2 also comprises at least one<br>
internal bridging surface 13 departing from the side<br>
walls 7a of the outlet portion 7 and substantially<br>
converging on the longitudinal axis Y of the tubular<br>
element 2, or in practice, toward the spout 5 created<br>
by the selfsame tubular element 2.<br>
More precisely, the bridging surface 13 in question<br>
can present an irregular profile, inasmuch as it<br>
might include differently oriented sections 13a and<br>
13b, but will in any event form an angle no greater<br>
than 90° with the longitudinal axis Y of the tubular<br>
element 2. In other words, each section 13a and 13b<br>
of the bridging surface 13 is disposed in such a way<br>
that the food product inside the container can flow<br>
freely from the spout: 5 withour stagnating and/or<br>
accumulating at any point along the way.<br><br>
In a first embodiment of the communicating duct 1,<br>
shown in figures 1 to 4, the bridging surface 13<br>
presents first sections 13a extending substantially<br>
parallel to the respective side walls 7a of the<br>
outlet portion 7 and at least one second section 13b<br>
integral with the first sections 13a, substantially<br>
normal to the longitudinal axis Y of the tubular<br>
element 2. With this configuration, the profile<br>
described by the internal bridging surface 13 along<br>
the direction of the spout 5 substantially resembles<br>
that of a funnel, following and complementing the<br>
internal profile presented by the outlet portion 7 of<br>
the container 4.<br>
In a second embodiment of the communicating duct 1,<br>
illustrated in figures 5 and 6, the connecting<br>
portion 9 presents a substantially solid structure<br>
and the connecting area 9a presents a plurality of<br>
alternating slots 14 and ribs 15 such as will serve<br>
as vents for any aeriform substances that may collect<br>
between the connecting area and the side walls of the<br>
outlet portion 7 during the course of the welding<br>
operation.<br>
In the course of the welding operation, moreover,<br>
the slots 14 combine with the side walls 7a of the<br>
outlet portion 7 to create a plurality of chambers 16<br>
in which the aforementioned aeriform substances will<br>
remain encapsulated, without influencing the<br>
effectiveness of the weld.<br>
Still referring to the example of figures 5 and 6,<br>
the internal bridging surface 13, which serves to<br><br>
convey the liquid food product in the container<br>
toward the spout 5, is disposed transversely to the<br>
longitudinal axis Y of the tubular element 2. To<br>
enhance the conveying action, the surface 13 might<br>
also be angled slightly toward the spout 5.<br>
In the examples of the accompanying drawings, the<br>
tubular element 2 presents a bottom end denoted 2a<br>
and, located at a top end 2b opposite from the bottom<br>
end 2a, a coupling portion 2c such as will accept a<br>
closure in the form of a cap (not illustrated, being<br>
conventional). In addition, the tubular element 2 can<br>
be provided with one or more annular projections 2d,<br>
located between the coupling portion 2c and the<br>
connecting portion 9, such as can be engaged by<br>
suitable means (not illustrated) serving to handle<br>
the relative container 4 during the process of<br>
applying the communicating duct 1 and completing the<br>
packaging cycle.<br>
The problems associated with the prior art are thus<br>
solved by the present invention, and the stated<br>
objects duly realized.<br>
First and foremost, the communicating duct 1<br>
according to the present invention enables optimum<br>
preservation of the food product batched into the<br>
container 4 with which it is associated, by virtue of<br>
its capacity to guarantee a hermetic sealing action<br>
and thus isolate the contents from the surrounding<br>
environment.<br>
Moreover, the incorporation of a flat connecting<br>
area 9a greatly facilitates the operation of welding<br><br>
the duct to the side walls 7a of the relative outlet<br>
portion 7, simplifying the operation significantly<br>
and rendering the sealing action more effective.<br>
Also advantageous is the inclusion of a connecting<br>
portion 9 with a bridging surface 13 located<br>
internally of the container 4, extending from the<br>
side walls 7a of the outlet portion 7 to the spout 5<br>
of the tubular element 2, which ensures the liquid<br>
product will flow directly to the spout without<br>
stagnating inside the container. In short, the<br>
particular geometry of the bridging surface 13 is<br>
such that there are no pockets or depressions<br>
directed toward the base 6a of the container 4, which<br>
in the case of the aforementioned prior art solutions<br>
are liable to trap both the flushing liquids used in<br>
manufacture, and the food product with which the<br>
container is ultimately filled.<br>
With this feature of the communicating duct 1 in<br>
mind, the invention achieves a notable reduction in<br>
the costs of producing and/or marketing containers A<br>
of the type in question, given that if flushing<br>
liquids are prevented from stagnating inside the<br>
containers, manufacturers are able to eliminate the<br>
need for costly equipment that might otherwise be<br>
needed to remove such accumulated liquids from the<br>
containers 4.<br><br>
