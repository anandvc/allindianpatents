In accordance with the invention, the compounds of general formula (I) can be prepared<br>
according to the process described in scheme 1.<br><br><br>
Scheme 1<br>
The compounds of the invention can be prepared according to scheme 1 by means of a coupling<br>
reaction, catalysed by a metal such as palladium, between a 2-arylimidazopyridine of general<br>
formula (II), in which Rl is defined as above and Hal is a halogen atom, and a derivative of<br>
general formula (III) in which X is a derivative of boron or of tin and R5 is the group so<br>
as to obtain the compounds of general formula (I).<br>
The compounds of the invention can also be prepared according to scheme 1 by means of a<br>
coupling reaction, catalysed by a metal such as palladium, between a 2-arylimidazopyridine of<br>
general formula (II), in which Rl is as defined above and Hal is a halogen atom, and a derivative<br>
of general formula (III) in which X is a derivative of boron or of tin and R5 is a carbonylated<br>
derivative R2COR3, in which R2 and R3 are defined as above, so as to obtain the compounds of<br>
general formula (IV), for example according to the method described by A. Gueiffier in Helv.<br>
Chim. Acta 2001, 84, 3 610-3 615.<br>
Next, the compounds of general formula (IV) can be converted to compounds of general<br>
formula (I) through the action of an organometallic derivative such as an organomagnesium<br>
compound, or by reduction of the carbonyl group by means of a metal hydride, for example<br>
sodium borohydride or one of its derivatives, or any other method known to those skilled in the<br>
art.<br>
The products of formula (I) can be subjected, if desired and if necessary, to any reactions<br>
known to those skilled in the art, in any order, in order to be converted to other products of<br>
formula (I).<br>
By way of examples of reactions, mention may be made of: acid-function esterification or<br><br>
amidation reactions, carbamoylation reactions, ester-function hydrolysis reactions, reactions to<br>
convert a hydroxyl function to an alkoxy function, coupling reactions catalysed by a transition<br>
metal, reactions for protecting reactive functions, reactions for eliminating protective groups that<br>
may bear the protected reactive functions, salification reactions with an inorganic or organic acid<br>
or with a base in order to obtain the corresponding salt, reactions for resolving racemic forms into<br>
enantiomers, said products of formula (I) thus obtained being, where appropriate, in any of the<br>
possible racemic, enantiomer and diastereoisomer isomeric forms.<br>
In scheme 1, the starting compounds and the reactants, when the method for preparing<br>
them is not described, are commercially available or described in the literature, or else can be<br>
prepared according to methods which are described therein or which are known to those skilled in<br>
the art.<br>

The compounds according to the invention were the subject of pharmacological assays for<br>
determining their modulatory effect on Nurr-1/NOT.<br>
Evaluation of the in vitro activity on N2A cells<br>
Assays consisted in measuring the in vitro activity of the compounds of the invention on a cell<br>
line (N2A) endogenously expressing the mouse Nurrl receptor and stably transfected with the<br>
NOT binding response element (NBRE) coupled to the luciferase reporter gene. The EC50 values<br>
are between 0.01 and 1000 nM. The assays were carried out according to the procedure described<br>
below.<br>
The Neuro-2A cell line comes from a standard commercial source (ATCC). The Neuro-2A clone<br>
was obtained from a spontaneous tumour originating from an A albino mouse strain, by R.J Klebe<br>
et col. This Neuro-2A line is subsequently stably transfected with 8NBRE-luciferase. The<br>
N2A-8NBRE cells are cultured until confluence in 75 cm2 culture flasks containing DMEM<br>
supplemented with 10% of foetal calf serum, 4.5 g/1 of glucose and 0.4 mg/ml of geneticin. After<br>
a week of culture, the cells are recovered with 0.25% trypsin for 30 seconds and then resuspended<br>
in DMEM without phenol red, containing 4.5 g/1 of glucose and 10% of Hyclone delipidized<br>
serum, and deposited into transparent-bottom 96-well white plates. The cells are deposited at a<br>
rate of 60 000 per well in 75 ul for 24 hours before the addition of the products. The products are<br>
applied in 25 ul and incubated for a further 24 hours. On the day of the measurement, an<br>
equivalent volume (100 ul) of Steadylite are added to each well and then left for a period of 30<br>
minutes in order to obtain complete cell lysis and maximum signal production. The plates are<br>
subsequently measured in a luminescence counter for microplates after having been sealed with an<br>
adhesive film. The products are prepared in the form of a stock solution at 102M and then diluted<br>
in 100% of DMSO. Each product concentration is prediluted in culture medium before incubation<br>
with the cells, thus containing 0.625% final concentration of DMSO.<br>
For example, compounds No. 17, 31, 39 and 40 of the table showed an EC50 value of 3.6 nM,<br>
14 nM, 0.7 nM and 0.7 nM, respectively.<br>
Evaluation of the binding to the human NOT receptor<br>
The direct binding between compounds of the invention and the human NOT receptor was<br>
evaluated using SPR (surface plasmon resonance) technology. In this assay, the protein is<br>
immobilized covalently to the matrix and the molecule to be studied is injected into the chamber<br>
containing the sensor chip (biosensor or reactive surface). The signal is directly proportional to<br>
the amount of product bound to the protein. The binding assays were carried out in a BIACORE<br>
S51 instrument (Biacore Inc., Piscataway N.J.). The GST-NOT (NOT-FL) whole protein was<br>
provided by Invitrogen (PV3265).<br>
The NOT ligand-binding domain (His-Thr-NOT 329-598) was expressed and purified as<br>
described in Nature 423, 555-560. The two proteins, diluted to a concentration of 20 ug/ml in an<br><br>
acetate buffer, pH 5.0, containing 5 mM of DTT, were immobilized on a carboxymethyl 5'<br>
dextran surface (CM5 sensor chip, Biacore Inc.) by amine coupling according to the protocol<br>
recommended by Biacore, elution being carried with an HBS-N buffer (10 mM HEPES, 0.15 M<br>
NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, pH 7.4). Approximately 10000-15000 resonance units (RU) of the proteins<br>
are captured on the surface of the CM5 sensor chip. The stock solutions of the compounds to be<br>
studied, at 1.5 mM in DMSO, are serially diluted in elution buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 8; 150 mM<br>
NaCl; 10 mM MgCl2; 2% DMSO, 1 mM DTT) to concentrations ranging from 3.75 to 0.1 uM.<br>
Each product concentration is injected at 4°C for 1 minute at 30 ul/min. The dissociation was<br>
recorded for 5 minutes without any other procedure for regenerating the surface. The signals<br>
obtained are corrected by testing each product concentration on an unmodified dextran surface<br>
(blank). The signal due to the migration buffer is deducted from the total signal ("double<br>
referencing") as is the effect of the DMSO. The signal analysis is carried out using the Biacore<br>
S51 analytical software (version 1.2.1). The compounds are subsequently classified according to<br>
their maximum binding level and to kinetic parameters for binding to the immobilized protein.<br>
By way of example, compound No. 9 has a high affinity and compound No. 10 has a medium<br>
affinity.<br>
It therefore appears that the compounds according to the invention have a NOT-modulating effect.<br>
The compounds according to the invention can therefore be used for the preparation of<br>
medicaments for their therapeutic use in the treatment or prevention of diseases involving NOT<br>
receptors.<br>
Thus, according to another of its aspects, a subject of the invention is medicaments which<br>
comprise a compound of formula (I), or an addition salt of the latter with a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable acid.<br>
These medicaments find their use in therapeutics, in particular in the treatment and prevention of<br>
neurodegenerative diseases, such as, for example, Parkinson's Disease, Alzheimer's Disease,<br>
tauopathies (for example, progressive supranuclear palsy, frontotemporal dementia, corticobasal<br>
degeneration, Pick's Disease), multiple sclerosis; cerebral traumas such as ischemia and cranial<br>
traumas and epilepsy; psychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia, depression, substance<br>
dependency, attention deficit hyperactivity disorders; inflammatory diseases such as vascular<br>
pathologies, atherosclerosis, joint inflammations, arthrosis, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis,<br>
allergic inflammatory diseases such as asthma, and finally, the treatment of osteoporosis or<br>
cancers.<br>
These compounds could also be used as a treatment associated with stem cell transplants<br>
and/or grafts.<br>
According to another of its aspects, the present invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions<br>
comprising, as active ingredient, a compound according to the invention. These pharmaceutical<br><br>
compositions contain an effective dose of at least one compound according to the invention, or a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt of said compound, and also at least one pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable excipient.<br>
Said excipients are selected according to the pharmaceutical form and the method of<br>
administration desired, from the usual excipients which are known to those skilled in the art.<br>
In the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention for oral, sublingual,<br>
subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, topical, local, intratracheal, intranasal, transdermal or<br>
rectal administration, the active ingredient of formula (I) above, or its salt, can be administered in<br>
unit administration form, as a mixture with conventional pharmaceutical excipients, to animals or<br>
to human beings for the prophylaxis or the treatment of the disorders or the diseases above.<br>
The appropriate unit administration forms include oral forms such as tablets, soft or hard<br>
gel capsules, powders, granules and oral solutions or suspensions, sublingual, buccal,<br>
intratracheal, intraocular and intranasal administration forms, forms for administration by<br>
inhalation, topical, transdermal, subcutaneous, intramuscular or intravenous administration forms,<br>
rectal administration forms, and implants. For topical application, the compounds according to the<br>
invention can be used in creams, gels, ointments or lotions.<br>
By way of example, a unit administration form of a compound according to the invention<br>
in tablet form can comprise the following components:<br>
Compound according to the invention	50.0 mg<br>
Mannitol	223.75 mg<br>
Sodium croscarmellose	6.0 mg<br>
Maize starch	15.0 mg<br>
Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose	2.25 mg<br>
Magnesium stearate	3.0 mg<br>
There may be specific cases where higher or lower dosages are appropriate; such dosages<br>
do not depart from the scope of the invention. According to customary practice, the dosage<br>
appropriate for each patient is determined by the physician according to the method of<br>
administration and the weight and the response of said patient.<br>
According to another of its aspects, the present invention also relates to a method for<br>
treating the pathologies indicated above, which comprises the administration, to a patient, of an<br>
effective dose of a compound according to the invention, or one of its pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
salts.<br><br>
