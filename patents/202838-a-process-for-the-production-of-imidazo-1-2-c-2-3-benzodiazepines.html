Processes for the production of the compounds of general formula 1 are described within WO 97/28163.<br>
The object of this invention is a new process for the synthesis of the compounds of general formula 1. Subjects of this invention are also new, previously unknown intermediate products of general formulas 5 and 6., which are processed within the framework of the synthesis and can be used per se or derivatized as starting materials for the synthesis of other target molecules.<br>
This object is achieved by the teaching of the claims. By the process according to the invention, fewer intermediate stages are processed than in the known synthesis from the prior art, the number of purification steps is significantly lower and the total yield is increased. The process according to the invention makes possible the production of the compounds of formula I on an industrial scale.<br>
The invention thus contains a process for the production of imidazo[l ,2-c][2,3]benzodiazepines of general formula 1<br>
in which R1, R2 and R3 as well as X and Y have the above meaning, from phenylacetic acids of general formula 4,<br><br><br><br>
in which X, Y and R1 have the above-mentioned meaning, a)        by esterification with an alcohol of Formula 5 a<br><br><br>
(5 a)<br><br>
to form phenylethyl acetate of general formula 5,<br><br>
(5) in which<br>
X, Y, R1, R2 and R3 have the above-mentioned meaning,<br><br>
b)        by condensation with ammonia or an ammonia donor to form the oxazole of<br>
general formula 6,<br><br>
in which<br>
1        2	3<br>
X, Y, R , R and R have the above-mentioned meaning, and subsequent hydrazinolysis to form the compounds of general formula 1.<br>
Imidazof[1,2-C][2,3]benzodiazepines of general formula 1 are synthesized according to Diagram <br><br><br>
The reaction of a compound of general formula 2 to form a compound of general formula 3 is carried out according to a process that is known in the art (e.g., J. Chem. Soc, Perkin Trans. 1 1991, 169 - 173) of a Friedel-Crafts reaction. For example, compounds of general formula 2 are reacted in the presence of Lewis acids, such as, for example, tin tetrachloride, alummum trichloride, titanium tetrachloride and an acylating agent, such as, for example, benzoyl chloride, benzoic acid anhydride or another activated carboxylic acid derivative. A significant increase in yield is achieved if additional N,M-dimethyl acetamide is added to the reaction mixture. As a solvent, halogenated hydrocarbons, such as, e.g., methylene chloride or ethylene chloride and<br><br>
mixtures thereof can be used. The reaction is performed in a temperature range of-30° to 50°C, but preferably in a temperature range of 0° to 25°C.<br>
The reaction of a compound of general formula 3 to form a compound of general formula 4 is carried out according to a process of a saponification reaction that is known in the art. For example, a compound of general formula 3 is heated in the presence of a base, such as alkali hydroxide, but preferably sodium hydroxide, in a solvent, such as a lower, preferably primary alcohol or water or mixtures thereof. The reaction is performed in a temperature range of 25° tol50°C, but preferably in the temperature range of 70°tollO°C.<br>
The reaction of a compound of general formula 4 to form a compound of formula 5 is carried out according to a process of an esterification that is known in the art. For example, a compound of general formula 4 is reacted in the presence of an activating reagent, such as, e.g., carbonyldiimidazole, and an alcohol of formula<br><br>
such as 3-hydroxy-2-butanone. As solvents, halogenated hydrocarbons, such as, e.g., methylene chloride or ethylene chloride, as well as THF and mixtures thereof can be used. The reaction is performed in a temperature range of-20° to 100°C, but preferably in a temperature range of 0° to 25°C.<br>
It is familiar to one skilled in the art that R^ and R^ can be varied in compounds of general formula 5 according to standard methods. This can take place by use of other alcohols in the esterification step, but also by reesterification of an ester that is already present. R2 and R3 can thus have the meaning of hydrogen, halogen, alkoxy, hydroxy, cyano, alkanoyl, optionally substituted alkynyl, optionally substituted alkenyl; alkyl or<br><br>
cycloalkyl that is optionally substituted by halogen, hydroxy, or alkoxy; or an optionally substituted aryl or hetaryl radical.<br>
The reaction of a compound of general formula 5 to form a compound of general formula 6 is carried out according to a process, known in the art, for the production of oxazoles by condensation of two carbonyl groups with ammonia. For example, a compound of general formula 5 is reacted in the presence of ammonium acetate, ammonia, an ammonia solution or another ammonia donor, such as, e.g., acetamide or formamide in the presence of acetic acid. As solvents, halogenated hydrocarbons, such as, e.g., methylene chloride or ethylene chloride; organic acids, such as e.g., formic acid or acetic acid, as well as lower alcohols, such as, e.g., methanol or ethanol, but also ethylene glycol and mixtures thereof, can be used. The reaction is performed in a temperature range of 0° to 150°C, but preferably in a temperature range of 50° to 100°C.<br>
The reaction of a compound of general formula 6 to form a compound of general formula 1 is carried out according to a process, known in the art, by hydrazinolysis or hydrazone formation. For example, a compound of general formula 6 is reacted in the presence of hydrazine or hydrazine-hydrate. As solvents, halogenated hydrocarbons, such as, e.g., methylene chloride or ethylene chloride, organic acids, such as, e.g., formic acid or acetic acid, as well as lower alcohols, such as, e.g., methanol or ethanol, but also ethylene glycol and mixtures thereof, are used. The reaction is performed in a temperature range of 0° to 200°C, but preferably in a temperature range of 80° tol20°C. A reaction scheme in an autoclave is possible.<br>
The reaction of a compound of general formula 5 to form a compound of formula 1 is also carried out in a single-pot reaction. For example, a compound of formula 5 is reacted in the presence of ammonium acetate, ammonia, an ammonia solution or another<br><br><br>
ammonia donor, such as, e.g., acetamide or formamide in the presence of acetic acid. As solvents, halogenated hydrocarbons, such as, e.g., methylene chloride or ethylene chloride; organic acids, such as, e.g., formic acid or acetic acid, as well as lower alcohols, such as, e.g., methanol or ethanol; but also ethylene glycol and mixtures thereof can be used. The reaction is performed in a temperature range of 0° to 150°C, but preferably in a temperature range of 50° to 100°C. After the reaction is completed, hydrazine or hydrazine-hydrate is added to the reaction mixture. The reaction is performed in a temperature range of 0° to 200°C, but preferably in a temperature range of 80° to 120°C. A reaction scheme in an autoclave is possible.<br>

(1)<br>
In an autoclave, 0.5 ml of hydrazine-hydrate is added to 2 g of 6, dissolved inl8 ml of ethylene glycol and 2 ml of concentrated acetic acid. It is heated for 12 hours to 120°C, and then the reaction mixture is mixed at room temperature with 2N aqueous NaOH.   It is extracted several times with ethyl acetate, and the combined organic phases are completely concentrated by evaporation in a rotary evaporator. The crude product is purified by column chromatography (hexane: ethyl acetate 9:1 -&gt; 8:2), and the yield of pure 1 is 1.2 g.<br>
