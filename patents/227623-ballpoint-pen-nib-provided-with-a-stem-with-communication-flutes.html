				<td>Ballpoint pen nib provided with a stem with<br>
communication flutes<br>
The field of the present invention is that of nibs for<br>
ballpoint pens, that is more specifically those parts,<br>
housing the writing ball, which are provided with a<br>
stem which is inserted coaxially into a hole in the<br>
lower end of the hollow barrel forming part of a<br>
ballpoint pen.<br>
As is well known, to ensure a continuous supply of ink<br>
from a reservoir (or refill) inside the said hollow<br>
barrel, connected to the nib, air must be allowed to<br>
enter this barrel from the outside so that the gradual<br>
outflow of ink during writing does not result in a<br>
vacuum that would prevent that outflow. In the prior<br>
art this is achieved by making a hole through the wall<br>
of the hollow barrel, or making the above-described<br>
hole at the lower end of the barrel slightly larger<br>
than the part of the stem housed within it, in order to<br>
create a clearance which will leave a large enough gap<br>
for air to enter.<br>
While the first approach raises aesthetic problems<br>
which may be incompatible with the quality image of<br>
ballpoint pens of a certain value, the second approach<br>
is detrimental both to the precision of the writing<br>
action (the nib tends to move inside the hole while<br>
writing) and the impression of careful workmanship and<br>
sturdiness and reliability of the ballpoint pen which a<br>
user may perceive.<br>
Another problem relating to the manufacture of<br>
ballpoint pens is how to cool the nibs as quickly as<br>
possible while they are being stamped, sized, drilled<br>
etc.<br>
Because of the fast production rates demanded in the<br>
processing of nibs for ballpoint pens, which are<br>
details with low added value, even a very small<br>
lengthening of the processing cycle time of each<br><br>
individual nib has significant repercussions on production costs.<br>
The inventor of the present innovation has de\ised a ballpoint pen nib in which both<br>
of the problems described above are overcome: on the outer surface of the part of the<br>
stem of the nib which is to be housed in the above-described hole formed in the lower<br>
end of the barrel are formed one or more flutes that extend parallel to the longitudinal<br>
axis of the stem for a length equal to or preferably greater than the axial length of the<br>
said hole.<br>
By fitting the nib into the latter, provided care is taken 1.0 ensure that the opposite ends<br>
of the said flutes are outside of it and on opposite sides with respect to it. one or more<br>
passages will be created, allowing the free passage of air under all conditions.<br>
There may be one or more than one of these flutes and they may describe paths<br>
different to the said axis of the stem, as will he explained later. They may also take the<br>
form of helical flutes.<br>
Forming these flutes at an early stage in the production of a ballpoint pen nib will also<br>
provide one or more communication channels for the cooling of the nibs, and in<br>
particular also of the part of the nib which is gripped by clamps or the like in the<br>
course of manufacture. The existence of these flutes, above all, increases the surface<br>
area allowing the exchange of heat between all parts of the nib and the fluid (air, oil<br>
etc.) used to cool them.<br>
The subject of the present invention is therefore a ballpoint pen nib as described<br>
hereinafter.<br>
A more detailed description will now be given of a preferred illustrative embodiment<br>
of a nib according to the invention, reference also being made to the accompanying<br>
drawings, in which:<br>
- Figure 1 is a longitudinal section through part of a ballpoint pen with the nib of<br>
the invention fitted into its hollow barrel:<br><br>
- Figure 2 shows a side view of that part of the<br>
stem of the nib of Figure 1 on which a number of<br>
radial flutes are formed; and<br>
- Figure 3 shows a cross section of the nib shown in<br>
Figures 1 and 2.<br>
Referring initially to Figures 2 and 3, which show a<br>
ballpoint pen nib 2 according to the invention, it can<br>
be seen that this nib 2, which as usual houses the ball<br>
3 at its pointed end, comprises a stem 6 having a<br>
narrow tail 8 for the application by known methods of<br>
the ink reservoir (not shown). A number of radial<br>
flutes 7i are formed on the outer surface of the said<br>
stem 6 parallel to the axis Z-Z of this stem 6,<br>
extending for a length L.<br>
The nib shown in Figures 2 and 3 is fitted into the<br>
hollow barrel 4, as shown in Figure 1, by coaxial<br>
male/female insertion of the part of its stem<br>
containing the said flutes 7i into a. cylindrical hole 5<br>
with which a lower end 4f of the hollow barrel 4 of the<br>
ballpoint pen 1 is provided.<br>
The axial length H of the abovementioned cylindrical<br>
hole 5 is less than the abovementioned length L of the<br>
flutes 7i, and the nib 2 is fitted into the hollow<br>
barrel 4 in such a way that the ends D, E of these<br>
flutes 7i are outside of the cylindrical hole 5, and on<br>
opposite sides with respect to it. In this way the<br>
interior of the hollow barrel 4 is in communication<br>
with the external environment through a number of<br>
channels formed by the above-described flutes 7i, which<br>
let air in to compensate for the volume of ink flowing<br>
towards the ball 3 during writing without any vacuum<br>
developing.<br>
In the example shown in the drawings the flutes 7i are<br>
arranged radially, and the profile of their cross<br>
section is an arc of a circle, but other arrangements<br>
and other shapes of the profile may freely be used. In<br>
the case in question, furthermore, the flutes are<br><br>
parallel to the longitudinal axis Z-Z of the stem 6,<br>
but they could also describe some different path.<br>
As noted earlier, the existence of the flutes 7i<br>
significantly increases the surface area allowing the<br>
exchange of heat between the outer surface of the nib 2<br>
and the coolant used in the course of its manufacture.<br>
According to the invention, furthermore, in order to<br>
make the clamping of the nib in the various phases of<br>
manufacture more reliable, at least two 9', 9' (Figure<br>
3) of the portions 9i of the outer surface of the said<br>
stem 2 that join the ends of the profiles of two<br>
adjacent flutes 7i are made flat.<br>
This flattening of two portions 9', 9' on mutually<br>
opposite sides of the axis Z-Z of the nib 2 provides a<br>
convenient pair of contact surfaces for a clamp or the<br>
like.<br>
The inventor also specifies the still more advantageous<br>
possibility of thus flattening all the portions 9i<br>
mentioned above. Giving the nib an even number of such<br>
portions 9i means that any pair of these can be gripped<br>
securely irrespective of the orientation of the<br>
workpiece. The insertion of a nib produced in this way<br>
(not shown in the drawings) into the said cylindrical<br>
hole 5 still produces a male/female fit, because it<br>
presses on the inner surface of the hole 5 via the<br>
edges W (Figure 3) created by the intersection of the<br>
portions 9i and the flutes 7i.<br>
As noted earlier, in the ballpoint pen nib of the<br>
invention the outer surface of at least part of its<br>
stem may also possess one or more helical flutes or<br>
grooves, their ends being located as explained in the<br>
first case. This example is not illustrated in the<br>
drawings.<br>
In this discussion and in the figures, the other parts<br>
of a ballpoint pen 1 to which the nib 2 of the<br><br>
invention is fitted, including the reservoir, have not<br>
been detailed as they are well known to those skilled<br>
in the art and require no further explanation.<br><br><br>
