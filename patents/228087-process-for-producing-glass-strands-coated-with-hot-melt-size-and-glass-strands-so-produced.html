				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to the manufacture of reinforcing strands<br>
used in the construction of composites. It relates more precisely to a process for<br>
producing glass strands coated with a hot-melt size, and also to the strands<br>
obtained and to the composites produced from said strands.<br>
It is known to manufacture glass reinforcing strands from streams of<br>
molten glass that flow out of the numerous orifices of a bushing. These strands are<br>
drawn into continuous filaments, they are then possibly combined with filaments of<br>
another material, before being assembled into strands that are collected, usually in<br>
the form of wound packages.<br>
Before they are assembled in the form of strands, the glass filaments pass<br>
through a device for coating them with a size or sizing composition. Deposition of<br>
the size is essential. Firstly, it allows a strand to be obtained with the filaments<br>
protected from abrasion by contact with the various processing members, thereby<br>
preventing them from breaking during manufacture and possibly during their use.<br>
Secondly, the size allows the strand to be combined with the organic and/or<br>
inorganic materials to be reinforced, by making it easier for the strands to be<br>
wetted by and impregnated with these materials.<br>
As a general rule, the size increases the adhesion between the glass and<br>
the materials to be reinforced, resulting in improved mechanical properties. The<br>
size also promotes mutual cohesion of the filaments, thereby resulting in better<br>
integrity of the strand, this property being especially desirable in textile<br>
applications where the strands must withstand high mechanical stresses during<br>
weaving.<br>
The sizing compositions most commonly used are aqueous compositions<br>
(with more than 85% water by weight) containing compounds that are capable of<br>
crosslinking subsequent to deposition on the filaments, especially under the effect<br>
of a heat treatment carried out after the strands have been collected together.<br>
Easy to produce and to deposit, these sizing compositions are also very stable<br>
and do not cure prematurely, which would make deposition impossible, whether<br>
during storage or beneath the bushing.<br><br>
In order for the strands to be effectively combined with the materials to be<br>
reinforced, it is necessary, however, to remove the water, this generally being<br>
achieved by drying the wound strand packages in ovens. However, this treatment<br>
is not entirely satisfactory because, on the one hand, it is expensive (the<br>
investment costs in terms of ovens and the operating costs, in particular those<br>
associated with energy consumption, are considerable) and, on the other hand, it<br>
causes the components of the size to migrate to the outside of the package,<br>
resulting in a strand of variable quality. In the case of composite strands, which<br>
combine glass filaments with filaments of a thermoplastic organic material, it may<br>
happen that the organic filaments have a change-of-state temperature (for<br>
example a glass transition temperature) close to 100Â°C, which precludes heating<br>
these strands to a temperature high enough to remove the water therefrom.<br>
One solution that avoids drying consists in using a hot-melt size based on<br>
a thermoplastic polymer which has the property of being liquid when it is heated<br>
and of solidifying upon cooling. Such a size, applied hot (at a temperature above<br>
its solidification temperature), makes it possible for those filaments to be more or<br>
less completely sheathed. The choice of the nature of the polymer depends on the<br>
matrix to be reinforced and/or on the organic filaments combined in the composite<br>
strand; there is a direct influence on the processibility of the strand and on the<br>
mechanical performance level of the composite materials produced from these<br>
strands.<br>
A drawback of hot-melt polymers lies in their insufficient ability to bond<br>
correctly to glass. In the case of composite strands, this results in poor cohesion of<br>
the filaments, which tend to group together depending on their nature, hence<br>
resulting in segregation that may lead to the formation of loops. In some<br>
applications, such as weaving, this strand cannot be used because knots form,<br>
which cause the weaving machines to stop.<br>
To remedy this drawback, it proves necessary to add at least one coupling<br>
agent to the size deposited on the glass. The coupling agent must have an affinity<br>
both for the glass and for the matrix to be reinforced, and possibly for the filaments<br>
other than the glass filaments when the strands are composite strands. The<br>
coupling agent must also be compatible with the constituents of the size without,<br>
however, prematurely reacting with them, which would cause a substantial<br><br>
increase in the viscosity, or even complete gelling, and would make deposition on<br>
the glass impossible.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a process for producing<br>
glass strands sized by compositions that contain at least one coupling agent and a<br>
hot-melt polymer, this process preventing premature or inopportune reactions<br>
between these constituents and requiring no drying.<br>
This object is achieved by the process according to the invention whereby<br>
molten glass streams, flowing out of orifices located in the base of one or more<br>
bushings, are drawn in the form of one or more sheets of continuous filaments, the<br>
filaments are then assembled into one or more strands that are collected on one or<br>
more moving supports, this process consisting in depositing a first composition<br>
containing a coupling agent on the glass filaments and then in depositing a second<br>
composition comprising a hot-melt polymer in the melt state on said filaments, at<br>
the latest during assembly of the filaments into one or more strands.<br>
The process according to the invention has several advantages. It uses a<br>
size involving little or no water, which therefore obviates strand drying treatments,<br>
and therefore representing a major saving. It improves the bonding of the coupling<br>
agent to the glass. Since the coupling agent is applied first, there is thus enough<br>
time for it to react with the glass before coming into contact with the hot-melt<br>
polymer. Similarly, since the coupling agent is deposited separately, the final<br>
amount on the strand may be precisely adjusted. The process limits the loss of the<br>
coupling agent by evaporation since the latter is applied at room temperature (that<br>
is to say without supplying additional energy) to cooled filaments, and<br>
consequently the risk of inhalation of toxic substances by the operators is kept at a<br>
very low level and there is a substantial saving (the coupling agent generally<br>
representing a substantial portion of the cost of the size).<br>
The process according to the invention, thanks to the advantages that it<br>
affords, allows strands to be obtained with a uniform quality over their entire<br>
length.<br>
In particular, this simply implemented process offers great freedom in<br>
choosing the coupling agent and the hot-melt polymer because they are<br>
introduced separately onto the filaments. It thus simplifies the preparation of the<br>
sizing compositions, this often being tricky owing to the problems of compatibility<br>
and/or homogenization of the constituents, which problems may be accentuated<br><br>
during storage and deposition of the size. Moreover, the process applies with the<br>
same advantages to the production of various types of glass-based sized strands<br>
as indicated below.<br>
In the present invention, the term "glass strands" is understood to mean<br>
glass-based strands, that is to say not only strands formed solely from glass<br>
filaments, but also strands formed from glass filaments and filaments of a<br>
thermoplastic organic material. In the latter case, while the glass filaments are<br>
being drawn, the formed filaments of organic material are extruded from an<br>
extrusion head and simultaneously entrained (or the strands of organic material<br>
are fed in at the same time from, for example, packages), the paths followed by<br>
the glass filaments and the filaments (or strands) of organic material converging<br>
on one another before said filaments are assembled into at least one mechanically<br>
entrained composite strand.<br>
The glass filaments may be drawn in the form of a sheet from a bushing or<br>
in the form of several sheets from one or more bushings and may be assembled<br>
into one or more strands. The drawing speed of the glass filaments in the process<br>
according to the invention is generally between 6 and 50, preferably 9 and 20,<br>
meters per second.<br>
According to the invention, the compositions, in particular the composition<br>
containing the coupling agent (first composition), are generally deposited on<br>
cooled glass filaments, that is to say those having a temperature not exceeding<br>
90Â°C, preferably 75Â°C, in order to avoid any risk of selective evaporation and to<br>
allow better control of the amount of material deposited on the filaments.<br>
Optionally, the cooling of the filaments may be speeded up by spraying an<br>
appropriate fluid, for example by spraying water which evaporates naturally before<br>
the coupling agent is deposited, and/or by blowing air.<br>
The first composition containing the coupling agent is deposited while the<br>
glass filaments are being drawn, but before they are assembled into strands, so as<br>
to prevent them from breaking on the assembling device. Preferably, the first<br>
composition is deposited as soon as the filaments have reached the cooling<br>
temperature indicated above so as to have the maximum possible time for contact<br>
between the glass and the coupling agent. This increases the bonding of the<br>
coupling agent before the second composition, which contains the hot-melt<br><br>
polymer, is applied. The application may take place, for example, using a sizing<br>
roller, a lipped device or a sprayer. Preferably, a sizing roller is used.<br>
The deposition of the second composition containing the hot-melt polymer<br>
takes place after the filaments have been coated with the first composition, and at<br>
the latest while the filaments are being assembled into strands. The deposition<br>
may be carried out using the same devices as those used for the first composition,<br>
these also having to be provided with means for keeping the hot-melt polymer in<br>
the melt state. The temperature for applying the hot-melt composition is generally<br>
less than or equal to 200Â°C, is preferably less than or equal to 160Â°C and better<br>
still is greater than 100Â°C. The temperature is chosen so that the viscosity of the<br>
hot-melt composition is low enough for it to be correctly deposited on the glass<br>
filaments and for the residual traces of water to be able to be removed. These<br>
requirements are satisfied with a viscosity of around 200 to 600 mPa.s, preferably<br>
300 to 500 mPa.s. The aforementioned temperature conditions furthermore reduce<br>
the risk of the polymer undergoing thermal degradation that may impair its<br>
properties, while nevertheless maintaining a reasonable energy consumption and<br>
satisfactory safety conditions for the operators.<br>
The composition applied firstly to the glass filaments comprises one or more<br>
coupling agents capable of bonding to the glass and of promoting bonding of the<br>
hot-melt polymer deposited subsequently. The coupling agent may be chosen, for<br>
example, from organofunctional silanes, especially those containing one or more<br>
hydrolysable groups, such as y-aminopropyltriethoxysilane, y-glycidoxy-<br>
propyltrimethoxysilane, y-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane, vinyltrimethoxy-<br>
silane, titanates and zirconates. The preferred coupling agent is<br>
y-aminopropyltriethoxysilane.<br>
The first composition may furthermore include a diluent that helps to<br>
dissolve the coupling agent or agents. The optional diluents are essentially water<br>
and any organic compound having, where appropriate, at least one particular<br>
function in the size, such as filament protection, strand flexibility, etc. Preferably,<br>
the composition contains no organic solvent for toxicity and volatile organic<br>
compound (VOC) emission reasons. More preferably, the composition contains<br>
water in an amount as low as possible but nevertheless sufficient for deposition<br>
under acceptable conditions and such that the water, once the composition has<br>
been deposited, can evaporate naturally, without supplying further energy.<br><br>
The coupling agent concentration in the composition depends on the<br>
application conditions, especially the speed at which the glass filaments are drawn<br>
and on the device used for the deposition. For example, good results are obtained<br>
with an aqueous composition comprising at least 5% by weight of coupling agent<br>
deposited on the filaments running at a speed of around 9 to 17 meters per<br>
second by means of a sizing roller.<br>
The second composition may comprise one or more polymers that can be<br>
deposited under the conditions of the process and can resist thermal degradation.<br>
The hot-melt polymers may be chosen from polymers that are solid at a<br>
temperature below 50Â°C and have a viscosity of between 200 and 600 mPa.s,<br>
preferably between 300 and 500 mPa.s, at the deposition temperature, which is<br>
generally around 100 to 200Â°C.<br>
The choice of polymer essentially depends on the material to be<br>
reinforced. In particular, it is important for the polymer to be compatible with said<br>
material when it is desirable for the final composite to have good levels of<br>
mechanical performance.<br>
When the strand is a composite strand, the choice also depends on the<br>
nature of the thermoplastic filaments used. In particular, it is necessary to ensure<br>
that the hot-melt polymer is compatible with these filaments, thereby preventing<br>
repulsion effects leading to the filaments bunching together according to their<br>
nature (glass or thermoplastic) and therefore being distributed nonuniformly within<br>
the strand.<br>
For example, when the thermoplastic filaments essentially consist of one<br>
or more polyolefins, such as polyethylene or polypropylene, the hot-melt polymer<br>
is a copolymer of ethylene and/or propylene with acrylic acid or maleic anhydride.<br>
When these same filaments essentially consist of one or more<br>
thermoplastic polyesters, such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET) or<br>
polybutylene terephthalate (PBT), the hot-melt polymer may be an epoxy, for<br>
example one belonging to the DGEBA (diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A) group.<br>
The amount of hot-melt polymer deposited on the glass filaments<br>
represents in general 2 to 15%, preferably 3 to 8%, by weight of the glass. Above<br>
15%, the state of solidification of the polymer on the filaments before they are<br>
assembled in the form of a strand is not complete, which results in substantial<br><br>
bonding between the filaments. The strand obtained is unusable as it lacks<br>
flexibility.<br>
The second composition may furthermore include a diluent for adapting<br>
the viscosity to the deposition conditions. This is usually a polymer of a similar<br>
nature to the hot-melt polymer, but one that is incapable of reacting with the<br>
coupling agent, for example a wax, especially a polyolefin wax.<br>
The compositions deposited on the glass filaments may furthermore<br>
include one or more compounds conferring particular properties on the size. These<br>
compounds (denoted hereafter by the term additives) may be provided by one or<br>
other of the compositions, preferably by the hot-melt composition.<br>
As additives, mention may especially be made of:<br>
-	lubricants, preferably nonionic lubricants;<br>
-	antistatic agents;<br>
-	antioxidants;<br>
-	UV stabilizers;<br>
-	nucleating agents;<br>
-	pigments.<br>
Preferably, the content of agents of each of the aforementioned categories<br>
is less than or equal to 1 % by weight of the size and advantageously the total<br>
content of additives is less than 5%.<br>
The choice of coupling agent and of hot-melt polymer, and also their<br>
amounts, depends in particular on the material to be reinforced by the strands<br>
according to the invention and on the intended application.<br>
As a general rule, the total amount of the compositions deposited on the<br>
glass filaments represents 2 to 15%, preferably 3 to 8%, by weight of the glass.<br>
The glass filaments coated with the size may be combined with filaments<br>
of a thermoplastic organic material before being assembled to form one or more<br>
composite strands. The combining operation is generally carried out by spraying<br>
the thermoplastic filaments into the sheet of glass filaments in order to obtain<br>
comingling of the filaments. The spraying may be carried out by any known means<br>
for fulfilling this role, for example a Venturi device.<br>
The constituent thermoplastic material of the filaments may be chosen<br>
from materials capable of giving filaments, especially by extrusion in a device such<br>
as an extrusion head. As examples, mention may be made of polyolefins, such as<br><br>
polyethylene and polypropylene, thermoplastic polyesters, such as polyethylene<br>
terephthalate (PET) and polybutylene terephthalate (PBT), polyethers and<br>
polyamides, such as nylon-11 and nylon-12.<br>
The strands are generally collected in the form of packages wound onto<br>
rotating supports, for example to form bobbins of continuous strands.<br>
They may also be collected on receiving supports moving translationally,<br>
allowing a mat of continuous or chopped intermingled strands to be formed. To do<br>
this, it is possible to use, for example, a device for spraying the strands toward the<br>
collecting surface that is moving transversely to the direction of the sprayed<br>
strands, said device also allowing the strands to be drawn and optionally chopped.<br>
The strands obtained according to the invention may thus be in various<br>
forms after collection: bobbins of continuous strands (ravings or cakes), chopped<br>
strands and assemblies (mats or networks). After conversion, they may be in the<br>
form of tapes, braids and fabrics.<br>
The glass filaments forming these strands have a diameter of between 10<br>
and 30 microns, preferably between 14 and 23 microns, and the glass may be any<br>
glass known for producing reinforcing strands, for example E-glass, AR<br>
(alkali-resistant)-glass, R-glass or S-glass. E- and AR-glasses are preferred.<br>
When the strand consists only of glass, its linear density may vary<br>
between 200 and 4000 tex, preferably 640 and 2000 tex.<br>
In the case of composite strands, the glass content may vary from 30 to<br>
85%, preferably 53 to 83%, by weight of the strand.<br>
At room temperature, the strands obtained are coated with a solidified<br>
size, the weight content of which is constant over the entire length of the strand.<br>
The strands according to the invention may be combined with various<br>
materials to be reinforced, especially with a view to producing composite<br>
components having good mechanical properties. The composites are<br>
advantageously obtained by combining at least strands according to the present<br>
invention with at least one thermoplastic organic material, such as polyolefins,<br>
polyvinylchlorides (PVCs) and polyesters.<br>
The glass content in the composites is generally between 20 and 80%,<br>
preferably 28 and 60%, by weight.<br>
The following examples will be used to illustrate the invention without,<br>
however, limiting it.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
E-glass filaments 18.5 pm in diameter, obtained from streams of glass<br>
output by a bushing having 800 orifices, were mechanically drawn at a speed of<br>
14 m/s.<br>
Along their path, they were coated with an aqueous solution containing<br>
16.10 wt% y-amino propyltriethoxysilane (SILQUEST A 1100, sold by Crompton) in<br>
contact with a sizing roller. The ambient temperature around the roller was about<br>
40Â°C.<br>
The filaments then passed over a second sizing roller placed<br>
approximately 30 cm from the first, and heated to 140Â°C, which delivered a<br>
composition containing 70 wt% of an ethylene/acrylic acid copolymer (AC 540,<br>
sold by Honeywell) and 30 wt% of polyethylene (AC 617, sold by Honeywell).<br>
Polypropylene filaments extruded from an extrusion head having 600<br>
holes passed through a Venturi device that sprayed them into the sheet of glass<br>
filaments after it had passed over the second sizing roller. The intimately mixed<br>
glass and polypropylene filaments were then assembled into a single strand,<br>
which was wound in the form of a roving.<br>
The strand obtained comprised 60 wt% of glass filaments having a loss on<br>
ignition of 4%.<br>
This strand could be easily handled - it was flexible and integral, and had a<br>
uniform coating over its entire length and good distribution of the glass filaments<br>
and polypropylene filaments within the strand, that is to say substantial comingling<br>
of all the filaments. It could also be woven, and the woven fabric obtained could be<br>
used to reinforce thermoplastic organic materials, especially polyolefins (PE and<br>
PP).<br>
EXAMPLE 2 (comparative example)<br>
This example was produced under the same conditions as for Example 1,<br>
but modified in that the two compositions were premixed in order to form a single<br>
composition, which was deposited on the filaments by means of the heated sizing<br>
roller.<br>
The composition obtained had a very high viscosity, making it impossible<br>
to be applied to the filaments using a sizing roller.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
E-glass filaments 18.5 urn in diameter, obtained from streams of glass<br>
output by a bushing having 800 orifices, were mechanically drawn at a speed of<br>
14 m/s.<br>
Along their path, they were coated with an aqueous solution containing<br>
16.10 wt% y-amino propyltriethoxysilane (SILQUEST A 1100, sold by Crompton) in<br>
contact with a sizing roller. The ambient temperature around the roller was about<br>
40Â°C.<br>
The filaments then passed over a second sizing roller placed<br>
approximately 30 cm from the first, and heated to 140Â°C, which delivered a<br>
DGEBA-type epoxy polymer (DER 671 sold by Dow Chemical).<br>
Polyethylene terephthalate filaments extruded from an extrusion head<br>
having 600 holes passed through a Venturi device that sprayed them into the<br>
sheet of glass filaments after it had passed over the second sizing roller. The<br>
intimately mixed glass and polyethylene terephthalate filaments were then<br>
assembled into a single strand, which was wound in the form of a roving.<br>
The strand obtained consisted of 65% glass. It was easy to handle and<br>
had properties similar to those of the strand of Example 1.<br>
This strand could be used as reinforcement in PVC, especially for the<br>
production of sections for windows.<br><br>

Dated this 13th day of September 2005<br><br>
The present invention relates to a process for producing glass strands<br>
coated with a hot-melt size, whereby molten glass streams, flowing out of orifices<br>
located in the base of one or more bushings, are drawn in the form of one or more<br>
sheets of continuous filaments, the filaments are then assembled into one or more<br>
strands that are collected on one or more moving supports, this process consisting<br>
in depositing a first composition containing a coupling agent on the glass filaments<br>
and then in depositing a second composition comprising a hot-melt polymer in the<br>
melt state, at the latest during assembly of the filaments into one or more strands.<br>
It also relates to the glass strands obtained according to this process and<br>
to the composites containing said strands.</td>
