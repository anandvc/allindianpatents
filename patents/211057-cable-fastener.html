				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates a cable fastener, and more<br>
particularly to such a cable fastener for fastening a cable to a<br>
machine or a support<br>
 A cable fastener is a device adapted for fastening to a board<br>
or support means to hold a cable or tubular member. U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,927,892, entitled "DEVICE FOR FASTENING A CABLE TO A<br>
"BOARD" shows a similar design. This device,/as illustrated in FIG.<br>
1A, comprises a casing 10" having two outer threads at its two<br>
opposite ends, a lock nut 11" threaded onto one end of the casing<br>
10" to secure the casing 10" to a board 30", a washer 15" mounted<br>
on the casing 10" and stopped between the lock nut 10" and a<br>
polygonal outward flange of the casing 10", a clamp 12" mounted<br>
on the other end of the casing 10", a collar 13" mounted in the<br>
clamp 12", and a chuck 14" threaded onto the casing 10" to<br>
compress the clamp 12" and the collar 13", causing the collar 13" to<br>
hold down a cable 20" in a hole on the board 30". This cable<br>
fastening device is still not satisfactory in function. When<br>
fastening up the chuck 14", the pawls 121" of the clamp 12" are<br>
radially forced inwards against the periphery of the cable 20",<br>
causing the cable 20" to be held down. However, because the pawls<br>
121" are spaced from one another by gaps, the contact between the<br>
pawls 121 and the periphery of the cable 20" are of "contact of<br>
point" that is insufficient to stop the cable 20" from being twisted<br>
or pulled axially. When the cable 20" is twisted or pulled axially<br>
with force (see FIG. 1B), the collar 13" may be forced out of<br>
position., and water may leak in through the gap between area A"<br>
and area B".<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention has been accomplished to provide a<br>
cable fastener, which eliminates the aforesaid problem. According<br>
to the present invention, the cable fastener comprises a casing<br>
installed in a hole on a board and secured thereto by a lock nut,<br>
collar within a clamp, and a chuck tightened to compress the clamp<br>
and the collar against the cable being inserted through the casing.<br>
The clamp is comprised of a plurality of pawls axially extended<br>
from and formed integral with one end of the casing, each pawl<br>
having a downward engagement portion that is forced by the chuck<br>
into an annular groove around the periphery of the collar<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Referring to FIGS. 2 and 3, a cable fastener in accordance<br>
with the present invention is generally comprised of a casing 10, a<br>
lock nut 11, a clamp 12, a collar 13, and a chuck 14. The casing 10<br>
comprises an axial through hole 101 through which a cable 20 is<br>
inserted., a first outer thread 103 at a cable input end 105 thereof, a<br>
second outer thread 104 at a cable output end 106 thereof, and a<br>
polygonal outward flange 102 raised around the periphery in the<br>
middle between the first outer thread 103 and the second outer<br>
thread 104. The lock nut 11 has a center through hole 111, and an<br>
inner thread 112 around the center through hole 111. By means of<br>
threading the inner thread 112 of the lock nut 11 onto the second<br>
outer thread 104 of the casing 10, the lock nut 11 can be moved<br>
axially on the casing 10 through a rotary motion. After the cable<br>
output end 106 through a through hole on a board 30, the lock nut<br>
11 is threaded onto the second outer thread 104 to fix the casing 10<br>
to the board 30 (see also FIG. 5A). Further, an annular gasket 15 is<br>
mounted on the second outer thread 104 and stopped between the<br>
polygonal outward flange 102 of the casing 10 and the board 30 to<br>
seal the gap. The annular gasket 15 is preferably made from rubber<br>
or plastics, having a protruded sealing rib 151 raised from one side<br>
around the center opening thereof. The chuck 14 comprises an axial<br>
center hole 141 for the passing of the cable 20, an inner thread 142<br>
for threading onto the first outer thread 103 of the casing 10, and a<br>
tapered inside wall portion 61 adapted to compress the clamp 12<br>
inwards. By means of threading the inner thread 142 of the chuck<br>
14 onto the outer thread 103 of the casing 10, the chuck 14 can be<br>
moved axially on the casing 10 through a rotary motion. The clamp<br>
12 is axially formed integral with the cable input end 105 of the<br>
casing 10, comprising a plurality of axial pawls 121 arranged in<br>
parallel. The pawls 121 each comprise a shank 122 axially extended<br>
from the cable input end 105 of the casing 10, and a downward<br>
engagement portion 123 at the distal end of the shank 122. As<br>
shown in FIG. 3, the downward engagement portions 123 of the<br>
pawls 121 are tilted in one direction. Further, the pawls 121 define<br>
with the cable input end 105 of the casing 10 and annular step 107<br>
around the axial through hole 101 for supporting the collar 13. The<br>
collar 13 is a flexible member (made from rubber or flexible<br>
plastics) mounted within the clamp 12 and stopped at the annular<br>
step 107, having an axial through hole 131 for the passing of the<br>
cable 20, and an annular groove 132 around the periphery<br>
corresponding to the downward engagement portions 123 of the<br>
pawls 121.<br>
Referring to FIGS, from 4 through 7, when fastening up the<br>
chuck 14, the tapered inside wall portion 143 of the chuck 14 is<br>
moved axially with the chick 14 on the casing 10 against the clamp<br>
12, thereby causing the downward engagement portions 123 of the<br>
pawls 121 to be forced into engagement with the annular groove<br>
132 of the collar 13, and therefore the collar 13 is inwardly<br>
compressed against the periphery of the cable 20. After installation,<br>
the cable 20 is positively held down in the casing 10 against<br>
external pulling force, and the contact area A between the<br>
periphery of the cable 20 and the collar 13, the contact areas A, B,<br>
C, D and E between parts of the cable fastener are well sealed.<br>
Because the collar 13 is stopped at the annular step 107 and<br>
maintained in engagement with the downward engagement portions<br>
123 of the pawls 121, the collar 13 is stopped from movement with<br>
the cable 20.<br>
While only one embodiment of the present invention has<br>
been shown and described, it will be understood that various<br>
modifications and changes could be made thereunto without<br>
departing from the spirit and scope of the invention disclosed.<br>
