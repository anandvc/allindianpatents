Further nutrients can be added to the invigorator comprising potassium,  phosphate,  magnesium,  manganese,<br><br>
boron, molybdenum, zinc, copper and cobalt depending upon the needs of the plants concerned.<br>
Examples of treatment of crops with the invigorator will- now be described in relation to the preferred embodiment given above.<br>
Examole 1<br>
Crop:     Strawberries Media:    Peat Modules Hanging Sprayed x 3    Dates:    11.03.01<br>
15.03.01<br>
19.03.01<br>
Crop was heavily infested with White Fly and Aphid species. First spray achieved 90% plus kill of both White Fly and Aphid. Second and third sprays achieved 100% kill of White Fly and only a small % of Aphid not accessible to spray surviving.<br>
Example 2<br>
Crop:     Commercial roses<br>
The crop prior to the first application of the invigorator had white fly adults and eggs,  red spider<br><br>
mite, baby and adult thrip, powdery mildew and botrytis. Crop vigour was also a problem due to poor light levels.<br>
. After the first application, the invigorator knocked out all the adult whitefly and some eggs, and partial killed the red spider adults and about 60% of the eggs. It dried out the mildew and botrytis. It cleared the baby thrip on the stems completely but it did not affect the adult thrips.<br>
On the second application a total wipe out: on the whitefly and red spider was achieved and no evidence of baby thrip or mildew to be found. Some adult thrips remained.<br>
Example 3<br>
Crop:     1.4 acres of Freesias under glass<br>
3 sprays of the Invigorator at 3 weekly intervals.<br>
Sprayed x3 Dates:   Wednesday 24 January 2001<br>
Wednesday 14 February 2 0 01 Wednesday 7 March 2 001<br>
The plant invigorator was used in a 0.8 acre block of metal glass and a 0.6 acre block of wooden glass of<br><br>
commercial freesias. 12 varieties of freesias were being grown. The frees ia crop was about 3 weeks away from picking at the first spray.<br>
The crop was assessed prior to the first spray and assessed once a week for nine weeks commencing 3 days after the first spray.<br>
There were small pockets of aphid present and very little botrytis before the first spray. The crop looked healthy, although a slightly lighter green due to the poor light levels.<br>
The first spray killed all aphids present and dried up the botrytis. The crop also responded favourably to the Nitrogen and Iron and looked a more lush darker green.<br>
Nc aphid was seen after the first spray and botrytis was virtually non-existent. The botrytis spores were not spreading although circulating fans were on day and night for the full trial period. The heating boilers were set to come on only if the temperature dropped below 3°c, basically frost protection only. Usually more botrytis would have been evident because of the damp conditions outside and the fact that heat was not being applied.<br><br>
Two small blocks adjacent to the trial block where the Invigorator was not used had a lot more botrytis present and Elvaron, a fungicide for botrytis, had to be applied on 3 occasions.<br>
Example 4<br>
Two preliminary trials were carried out using the Invigorator to assess the effects of the product on protected roses, in particular, to quantify the effect on whitefly and red spider mite. The product was applied to both leaf surfaces using conventional hydraulic spray equipment at the rate of 1 litre of product/500 litres of water. A 3-spray programme was used with spray intervals of approximately 3 days.<br>
Site 1<br>
La Moye Roses<br>
The whitefly prone cv Kiss was used in the trial. Unfortunately the first spray had been applied before the first leaf samples were taken. A random sample of middle leaves was taken after the first spray and after the last spray to quantify the effects of the treatment.   Ten<br><br>
terminal leaflets were viewed under the microscope and pest counts completed.<br>
The .first spray had killed most of the adult whitefly; additional sprays did not significantly improve this visual effect. There was no obvious phytotoxicity to the crop. There was a positive improvement in leaf quality with the leaves a darker green and the absence of the normal stickiness associated with whitefly epidemics. There was also evidence that the sooty mould development was reduced.<br><br>

The product appeared to have a significant effect en the larval stage rather than the egg and pupal stage. Eggs that had started to hatch were affected and the emerging larval were mostly killed.<br>
Site 2<br>
Franc Fief Vinery<br>
The trial was carried out on the cv Bianca which had a significantly high level of whitefly and some red spider mite. The previous 2 treatments were based on Chess a new aphicide/whitefly insecticide. The grower noted a significant knockdown of the adult population after the first spray of the Invigorator. He also noted that the leaves were cleaner with spray deposit and sooty mould reduced after the treatments. However, the flowers may have been affected by the spray because the petals were sticking together and failing to unfold.<br>

Again the product gave a significant reduction in the number of larvae.<br>
This site also had an infestation of red spider mite. The whole block received one Invigorator treatment. A smaller area within the block received a further 2 sprays whereas the remainder had a treatment based en Aseptacarex and Applaud. This allowed a direct corrarison on red spider mite control as Aseptacarex is an acaricide<br>

The Invigorator programme gave a significant increase in red spider mite activity compared with the Aseptacarex.<br>
As can be seen the Invigorauor proved to be an effective treatment for the control of adult whitefly. A single spray gave a high knockdown of the adult population.<br><br>
A second aspect of the present invention relates tc water retaining means.<br>
It has previously been proposed to provide compost and other materials to retain water, which can also be altered so that it contains nutrients and such like. Furthermore it has been proposed to provide compost and such material in PVC bags for growing plants in for instance on the patio of a house.<br>
It is an aim of the present invention to provide a water retaining means which retains a high level of moisture and nutrient and is suitable for use in temperate and arid conditions.<br>
Accordingly the present invention is directed to water retaining means which for a volume of 13,800 cm3 contains the following ingredients:<br>
a.	6 - 12.5 litres of one of the following coco compost<br>
(Coir),   peat,  bark,   rockwool,  glasswool,   wood shavings, purlite, vermiculite, composted waste<br>
b.	0 - 140 grams = 0-50% volume of dry shredded paper,<br>
c.	10  -  250  grams  copolymer  acrylamide  acrylate  of<br>
reticulated sodium<br>
d.	10  -  200  grams disodium  ferric  diethylenetriamine<br>
penta-acetic acid (FeDTPA) (7% Iron as Fe) .<br>
e.	50 - 400 grams Ureaform (38%N),<br>
f.	20 - 300 grams ammonium nitrate (34.5%N),<br><br>
g. 5 - 50 grams moncpotassium phosphate<br>
h. 5 - 3 0 grams trace elements (Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, B, Mo, K)<br>
in a suitable base, the means being further equipped with an irrigation pipe.<br>
This provides the advantage that the water retaining means can be buried in soil or sand near a shrub, tree or bush to provide a source of water and nutrient. Furthermore when the means is buried watering is possible through the irrigation pipe with the result that water is held in the container not on the surface.<br>
Preferably the irrigation pipe is a solid PVC pipe, metal pipe or flat plastics material tube with holes. The irriaation pipe tube connected to one inlet which can irrigate a number of containers. If several containers are placed around a single shrub, bush or tree or several shrubs, bushes or trees these can be watered by one inlet.<br>
Preferably the contents of the means can be retained using compressed coir, peat, bark, rockwool, wood shavings, purlite, vermiculite or composted waste.<br>
Preferably the means are retained by a container. This provides the advantage of better retaining the moisture in the means.<br><br>
Advantageously the container can be made from any one of the following materials; polythene, polypropylene, plastics material, board, cardboard, wood, paper.<br>
- Advantageously the container is made of cardboard, this provides the advantage that it is biodegradable.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the water retaining means contains:<br>
a.	12.5 litres of cocc compost (Coir),<br>
b.	70 grams - 25% volume of dry shredded paper,<br>
c.	50 grams copolymer acrylamide acrylate of reticulated<br>
sodium,<br>
d.	50  grams  disodium  ferric  diethylenctriamine penta-<br>
acetic acid (FeDTPA),<br>
e.	200 grams Ureaform,<br>
f.	100 grains Nitram- ammonium nitrate,<br>
g.	15 grams monopotassium phosphate<br>
h. 10 grams trace elements<br>
The container when in use is preferably sited seme ten centimetres below the sand/soil surface and the irrigation pipe sticks up through the surface to allow irrigation.<br>
Examples of use of the container will now be given<br>
below:<br>
amending soilless composts,<br>
amending soils for planting beds and such like,<br><br>
transplanting  rooted cuttings,  seedlings  and bedding<br>
plants, and<br>
transplanting trees and shrubs<br>
■An example of a water retaining means made in accordance with the present invention comprises a 400mm x 3 00mm x 115mm (external measurement) container made of test board, which contains:<br>
1.	12.5 litres of coco compost (Coir)<br>
2.	70 grams - 25% volume of dry shredded paper<br>
3.	50 grams Supersorb (composition; copolymer acrylamide acrylate of reticulated sodium)<br>
4.	50 grams Librel Fe-DP Chelate (7% Iron as Fe, chemical name: Disodium Ferric Diethylenctriamine Penta-Acetic Acid (FeDTPA))<br>
5.	200 grams Nitroform (chemical name: Ureaform - 38%N)<br>
6.	100 grams Nitram (chemical name: Ammonium nitrate -34.5%N)<br>
7.	15 grams Monopotassium Phosphate (technical grade)<br>
8.	10 grams Frit 253 trace elements<br>
and  is  equipped  with  a  PVC  irrigation  pipe  which protrudes from its top.<br>
The cardboard box can vary in length,  width and depth:<br><br>
e.g. 1:200mm x 150mm x 80mm (external measurements) -2,400 cm3 or 2:1200mm x 900mm x 345mm (external measurements) - 372,600 cm3<br>
.The cardboard can be thicker or thinner: e.g.  l:  112/112/112  (single or double fluting)  or 2: 3 00/200/300  (single fluting)  or 3:  300/150/300 (double fluting)<br>
The container is designed primarily to aid the transformation of desert areas into lush green plantations. Its main role is to conserve water and to provide protection for the sand or soil surrounding the root zone area of trees, bushes, shrubs and plants by keeping it moist and cool.<br>
The container incorporates a mix formulated for desert regions, which keeps the container in a state of controlled dampness to create a cooling effect and ready availability of nutrients whenever water is applied directly on to the container. This also keeps the roots of the plant healthy and stops aggravation by dryness or salt scorch through lack of correct systematic watering.<br>
The  container's  ultimate  aim  is  that  of  water conservation and green and healthy growth.  A blend of natural coir,  a long lasting effective soil improver, which contains 60% natural lignin mixed with capillary matrix, is used.  The container has a formulated mix of<br><br>
NPK plus trace elements, with extra nitrogen added to overcome nitrogen starvation that may result from bacterial activity which can cause "nitrogen fixation' .<br>
•The container eventually breaks down fulfilling its secondary role in tightening up the sand/soil and building up the structure for better water and nutrient retention.<br>
The working life of a container is approximately 3 years, this is due to the ability of being able to regulate the breakdown period of this special mix.  The<br>
r<br>
nutrient period lasts approximately 12 months, however nutrient levels can be easily topped up cost effectively over the remaining life of the container.<br>
The container has the following advantages that it is:<br>
biodegradable,<br>
reduces volume and frequency of watering, greatly reduces water evaporation, slow release nutrient feed system, green and healthy growth stimulant, helps to keep sand/soil cool and moist,<br>
lowers pH and controls temperature around the root zone, long lasting effective sand/soil improver, improves aeration and structure of soil, encourages microbial population activity,<br><br>
nutrient levels can be easily topped up.<br>
The container can also be used on existing areas of trees, bushes and shrubs to encourage a healthier growth and conserve vast amounts of precious water. This will enable more areas to be planted without using extra water.<br>
Figure 1 shows examples of the container in use in which the appropriate number of containers are buried flat around the bush, shrub or tree to suit the size of bush, shrub or tree. Figure la shows two containers positioned round a small to medium sized bush or shrub. Figure lb shows three containers positioned round a small tree of large bush or shrub. Figure 1c shows four containers positioned round a medium sized tree. Figure Id shows six containers positioned round a large tree. Figure 2 shows the container when positioned for use so that the top of the container is approximately 10cm below sand/soil level. The irrigation pipe protrudes through the soil or sand surface. The relevant irrigation section is connected up. Each container receives at least 12 litres of water at first watering so it is well saturated.<br>
After 1 year a mixture of nutrients can be added to each container to maintain green plantations. The irrigation  nozzle  is  removed,  nutrient  tablets  are<br><br>
dropped into tube, which are then, pushed into container with a plunger and the irrigation nozzle replaced. This process should be repeated every six months throughout the remaining 2 year life of the container.<br><br><br>
