WO 2007/017427	PCT/EP2006/064942<br>
2<br>
Brief description of the Drawings<br>
Further characteristics and advantages of the invention will become<br>
better apparent from the following detailed description of some non-<br>
exclusive embodiments of a nozzle according to the invention, illustrated by<br>
way of non-limiting example in the accompanying drawings, wherein:<br>
Figure 1 is a sectional side elevation view of a first embodiment of a<br>
nozzle for extinguishing devices and the like according to the invention;<br>
Figure 2 is a sectional side elevation view of a second embodiment of<br>
a nozzle for extinguishing devices and the like according to the invention;<br>
Figure 3 is a sectional side elevation view of the nozzle of Figure 2,<br>
associated with an extinguisher of the type that comprises a tank for the<br>
extinguishing agent.<br>
Ways of carrying out the Invention<br>
With reference to the figures, the reference numeral 1 generally<br>
designates a nozzle according to the invention, which is associated with an<br>
extinguisher E.<br>
It should be noted that the nozzle 1 can be associated with any<br>
extinguishing device and therefore with extinguishers, fire-fighting systems,<br>
and the like.<br>
The nozzle 1 is made of a material with a high heat conductivity<br>
coefficient and comprises a darough opening 2, at least one portion of which<br>
is blocked hermetically by a pad 3 made of thermoplastic material, which is<br>
automatically removable due to the pressure of the extinguishing agent at a<br>
predefined temperature, so as to allow automatic dispensing of said<br>
extinguishing agent.<br>
In a first embodiment, the nozzle 1 is advantageously of the De Laval<br>
type, and the opening 2 comprises in succession, along the direction of<br>
expulsion of the extinguishing agent, a converging part 2a and a diverging<br>
part 2b.<br><br>
WO 2007/017427	PCT/EP2006/064942<br>
3<br>
Conveniently, the converging part 2a is blocked hermetically by the<br>
pad 3, which is shaped complementarity with respect to said part; the pad 3<br>
is provided for example by pouring into the converging part 2a the<br>
thermoplastic material, which is conveniently heated, in the fluid state: once<br>
the part 2a has been filled, the material is cooled and the solidified pad 3<br>
allows its hermetic closure. Positively, with the extinguishing device in the<br>
operating configuration, the pressure applied by the extinguishing agent also<br>
keeps the pad 3 pressed hermetically against the walls of the converging<br>
part 2a.<br>
The extinguishing agent is preferably constituted by a suitable gas<br>
such as nitrogen, carbon dioxide, halon and others.<br>
Favorably, the nozzle 1 comprises heat conduction means, constituted<br>
preferably by a plurality of fins 4 which are distributed peripherally thereto,<br>
so as to follow rapidly the abnormal temperature variations caused by the<br>
onset of a fire in the environment controlled by the extinguishing device.<br>
The nozzle 1 can comprise a security element which is adapted to<br>
prevent the violent expulsion, at high speed, of the pad 3, which is<br>
constituted for example by a pin 5 which is inserted detachably in at least<br>
one respective hole of the nozzle 1 and is arranged transversely to the<br>
diverging part 2b, so as to block the pad 3.<br>
Conveniently, the nozzle 1 comprises an end shank 6 for coupling to<br>
outlets of the extinguishing devices and further comprises advantageously a<br>
contoured portion 7, which is shaped for example like a hexagonal nut and<br>
is adapted to be gripped by a tool so as to allow optimum fastening to said<br>
outlets.<br>
In a second embodiment, which can allow faster insertion of the pad<br>
3, the opening 2 of the nozzle 1 comprises at least a straight part 2c and a<br>
diverging part 2b, which are arranged respectively along the direction of<br>
expulsion of the extinguishing agent, the straight part 2c being closed<br>
hermetically by the pad 3 (as shown in Figures 2 and 3). In particular, the<br><br>
WO 2007/017427	PCT/EP2006/064942<br>
4<br>
pad 3 is located in a receptacle 2d, which is arranged at the end of the<br>
straight part 2c and is formed inside the threaded hollow shank 6: die pad 3<br>
has a substantially circular transverse cross-section whose diameter is<br>
substantially equal to the inside diameter of the thread of the shank 6. In this<br>
second embodiment, the grip portion 7 is provided on the outside of the<br>
shank 6.<br>
The pad 3 can be conveniently provided separately and inserted<br>
rapidly within the receptacle 2d inside the shank 6; after this, the nozzle 1 is<br>
associated with the extinguishing device (of any type). Favorably, with said<br>
extinguishing device in the active configuration, the pressure applied by the<br>
extinguishing agent helps to keep the pad 3 pressed so as to close<br>
hermetically the straight part.<br>
In Figure 3, the nozzle 1, as mentioned, is associated with, an<br>
extinguisher E, which comprises a tank 8 which contains the extinguishing<br>
agent, and in particular the nozzle 1 is associated with a flexible hose 9 of<br>
the extinguisher E, so that it can be positioned in the points of the controlled<br>
environment where it is presumed that a fire may start.<br>
Effectively, the extinguisher E can be provided with a plurality of<br>
flexible tubes or hoses 9, each associated with a respective nozzle 1, so as to<br>
control several points deemed critical for the possible starting of a fire.<br>
Each nozzle 1 is associated with the flexible hose 9 by means of a<br>
terminal connecting sleeve 10, and in particular the terminal shank 6 of the<br>
nozzle 1 is hollow and threaded for fastening in a corresponding threaded<br>
terminal outlet 10a of the sleeve 10.<br>
The terminal outlet 10a also helps to keep the pad 3 pressed so as to<br>
close hermetically the straight portion (or, in the case of the first<br>
embodiment of the nozzle 1, pressed against the walls of the converging<br>
portion 4a).<br>
The sleeve 10 is adequately made of a material with a high heat<br>
conduction coefficient for optimum transmission of the heat to the nozzle 1.<br><br>
WO 2007/017427	PCT/EP2006/064942<br>
5<br>
As shown in Figure 3, the extinguisher E comprises a connecting<br>
element 11, which is associated in an upper region with respect to the tank 8<br>
and is provided with at least one threaded coupling 12 for the connection of<br>
a respective flexible hose 9, or with a plurality of couplings 12 for the<br>
connection of a corresponding number of flexible hoses 9 for controlling, as<br>
mentioned, a larger number of critical points.<br>
Conveniently, a bush 13 is provided for connecting the tank 8 and the<br>
connecting element 11 and is threaded externally for fastening in a<br>
corresponding internally threaded inlet of the tank 8 and in a corresponding<br>
internally threaded end of the connecting element 11.<br>
A safety device is associated with the connecting element 11 and is<br>
adapted to expel automatically the extinguishing agent if the tank 8<br>
accidentally overheats.<br>
Such safety device comprises a cap 14, which is provided with a<br>
diaphragm 15 which breaks automatically at a preset pressure.<br>
Advantageously, there is also a monitoring pressure gage 16 for<br>
checking the internal pressure of the extinguishing agent contained in the<br>
tank 8. The extinguisher E comprises a valve 17 with controlled closure for<br>
controlling the flow of the extinguishing agent between the tank 8 and the<br>
connecting element 11, said valve being provided within the cavity of the<br>
bush 13.<br>
The bush 13 forms, proximate to a first end thereof, a port 18 for the<br>
passage of the extinguishing agent, and there is a flow control element 19,<br>
which is accommodated slidingly within the bush 13 and kept elastically in<br>
the configuration for closing hermetically the port 18, and a stem 20 for<br>
opening the port 18, which is accommodated so that it can slide heimetically<br>
in the connecting element 11.<br>
In particular, the flow control element 19 is provided in an upper<br>
region with a sealing O-ring (not shown in the figures) and is pushed by a<br>
spring 21 which abuts, at its other end, against a threaded bushing 22, which<br><br>
WO 2007/017427	PCT/EP2006/064942<br>
6<br>
is fastened to the other end of the bush 13; the stem 20 is coaxial to the flow<br>
control element 19 and is provided with an internal head 20a for abutment<br>
against a tab 19a of the flow control element 19 which protrudes from the<br>
port 18 for opening it, and with a grip head 20b which protrudes from the<br>
connecting element 11 for the manually-controlled opening of the valve 17.<br>
In practical operation, in the case of the extinguisher E, the nozzle or<br>
nozzles 1 are positioned quickly and easily in the points deemed critical of<br>
the environment to be controlled by means of the flexible hoses 9, which<br>
therefore allow to arrange conveniently the tank 8 also outside the<br>
environment.<br>
The environment to be controlled can be for example the inside of an<br>
engine compartment or of another confined volume.<br>
If a fire occurs, the temperature variation of the controlled<br>
environment is transmitted rapidly to the nozzle 1 by the fins 4, and once a<br>
preset temperature has been reached, the pad 3 of thermoplastic material<br>
softens and is expelled automatically through the opening 2 by the pressure<br>
of the extinguishing agent, which by escaping and flooding the controlled<br>
environment allows to extinguish the fire.<br>
The pin 5, when provided, blocks the pad 3 at the exit from the<br>
opening 2, preventing its violent expulsion at high speed, if this intervention<br>
is deemed appropriate.<br>
In particular, the temperature at which the pad 3 softens is determined<br>
by the manufacturer according to requirements, choosing conveniently a<br>
low-melting plastic material with a different softening temperature<br>
depending on the expectations of the fire load and of its increase over time.<br>
Again if the nozzle 1 is associated with the extinguisher E, the tank 8<br>
has a capacity which is proportional to the number of hoses 9 and<br>
corresponding nozzles 1, and if the applicable standards require its<br>
installation, the safety cap 14 allows the expulsion of the extinguishing<br>
agent from the diaphragm 15 once a preset safety pressure has been reached.<br><br>
WO 2007/017427	PCT/EP2006/064942<br>
7<br>
Advantageously, it is possible to install on the valve 17 a pressure<br>
gage 16, which allows the user to check the filling of the tank 8 during the<br>
loading of the extinguishing agent and to check subsequently whether the<br>
tank 8 has been emptied, for example due to the activation of the<br>
extinguisher E due to a fire.<br>
If the extinguisher E, and in general the extinguishing device, has<br>
actually been activated to extinguish a fire, the nozzles 1 can be restored<br>
easily and quickly in a suitable workshop by performing sequentially simple<br>
and inexpensive maintenance operations, such as the removal of the nozzles<br>
1, the application of a new pad 3, and the refitting of said nozzles<br>
(facilitated by the presence of the contoured portion 7). Also in the case of<br>
the extinguisher E, the sequence of the operations for maintaining and<br>
restoring said extinguisher is: removing the nozzles 1 and the flexible hoses<br>
7 from the couplings 12; replacing the pad 3; refastening the nozzle 1 to the<br>
sleeve 10; filling the tank 8 by means of the coupling 12 while the valve 17<br>
is opened; closing the valve 17 (by acting on the stem 20), connecting the<br>
hose 9 to the coupling 12, and finally opening the valve 17, so as to bring<br>
the extinguisher E to the configuration for use.<br>
Positively, the nozzle 1 can be associated with any extinguishing<br>
device, not only for engine compartment or confined volumes, but also for<br>
other volumes, adapting in this case the capacity of the tank 8 as well as the<br>
number of nozzles 1 and the length of the hoses 9.<br>
In practice it has been found that the invention fully achieves the<br>
intended aim and objects, since the nozzle 1 allows automatic dispensing of<br>
the extinguishing agent by way of the pad 3, which can be removed<br>
automatically at a preset temperature, due to the action of the pressure of<br>
said extinguishing agent, thus ensuring maximum effectiveness. Further, the<br>
nozzle 1 is simple to maintain and restore, with advantages also from an<br>
economic standpoint.<br>
The invention thus conceived is susceptible of numerous<br><br>
