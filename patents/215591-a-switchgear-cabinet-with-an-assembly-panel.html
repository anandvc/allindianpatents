				<td>The invention relates to a switchgear cabinet which is closable by means of wall members and a cabinet door, there being disposed parallel to one vertical side wall an assembly board, which is displaceable by means of sliders on at least one guide rail in the direction of the associated side wall, and which may be brought into an assembly position.<br>
Such a switchgear cabinet is known for example from DE 41 40 072 Al.  Such switchgear cabinets have a rack which is made up of vertical and horizontal frame members.  The two lower horizontal frame members extending in the direction of the depth of the switchgear cabinet, are formed from a sheet metal blank which is folded several times.  In the open hollow profile thus provided, there is generated a web with a longitudinal edge, upon which the slider is mounted with a slot-shaped receiving means.  The assembly board can thus be displaced on its sliders in the direction of the side wall, for example the rear wall lying opposite the cabinet door, until it reaches its assembly position.<br>
The webs with the longitudinal edges are often felt to be inconvenient, as for certain built-in components they render mounting on the horizontal frame members<br>
difficult.  A similar assembly panel attachment ;Ls also known from DE 43 12 487.<br>
It is the object of the invention to provide a switchgear cabinet of the type already mentioned, in which there is no restriction to the possibilities of incorporation on the frame members by reason of the guide rails.<br>
This object of the invention is achieved in that the guide rail is designed as a separate part and is detachably secured to the switchgear cabinet by means of positioning units, and in that the guide rail can be removed from the switchgear cabinet after the assembly board has been positioned.  The guide rails can thus be manufactured as a separate component.  They are secured with the positioning units before the assembly board is inserted into the switchgear cabinet.  Then the assembly panel can be pushed in and secured in its intended position.  The guide rails can then be simply removed from the switchgear cabinet, so that they represent no hindrance.<br>
More advantageously, two guide rails are secured at a spacing apart in the inner cavity of the switchgear cabinet, in order to guide the assembly board in a way which is secure against tilting.  However, one single or more than two guide rails may also be used.<br>
According to an advantageous development of the , invention, the positioning units are secured in receiving means of frame members of a rack.  In this way a stationary and direct attachment to the switchgear cabinet is possible.  The rack has sufficient strength to enable it also to carry assembly boards which are already loaded, and are therefore heavy.<br>
According to a preferred variant embodiment of the invention, the rack has horizontal and vertical frame members, the horizontal frame members forming a base and a top frame, and the receiving means for the positioning units are formed by rows of attachment means, which are inserted in the longitudinal direction of the horizontal frame member.  Thus the attachment means, which are normally used for the attachment of built-in components, can also be used for the guide rails.<br>
The guide rail can be simply and cheaply manufactured if it is in a U-profile shape, and is formed from a central portion and two connecting arms spaced apart parallel to one another, and if the central portion has a sliding portion for the slider.  The guide rail is thus inserted into the switchgear cabinet in such a way that the two webs point downwards.  The central portion then offers a flat sliding surface for the slider.  Due to the two webs, a high resistance to bending is<br>
generated in the guide rail.  By means of these ^imple measures, even heavy assembly boards can be displaced on the guide rail.<br>
If for each positioning unit two bolts are used, which are provided with a chamfered insert piece, secure attachment of the guide rail is possible.  By means of using two respective bolts per positioning unit, the degree of freedom for the offset movement of the guide rail solely in the direction of the height of the switchgear cabinet can be limited.<br>
In order to ensure simple handling, according to the invention there is attached to the guide rail a handle, which projects over the front side of the switchgear cabinet closable by the cabinet door, and the sliding portion is continued on to the handle.  By means of the handle therefore the guide rail may be easily inserted into the switchgear cabinet and removed therefrom, once assembly is completed.  By virtue of the fact that the sliding portion also continues on to the handle, the assembly panel may be set on to the guide rail while still outwith the switchgear cabinet.  This to a considerable degree simplifies mounting of the assembly panel on the guide rail.<br>
In order securely to guide the assembly board on the guide rails, the slider has a support surface, by means of which it is guided on the sliding portion of the<br>
guide rails, and there are attached to the slidej: one or a plurality of guides, which hold the slider on the sliding portion.<br>
A switchgear cabinet according to the invention is characterised in that there is connected to the slider a retaining member with a plug-in portion, which is introduced into a correspondingly-shaped socket portion of the assembly panel, and in that the retaining member may be secured on an attachment means connected to the switchgear cabinet.<br>
In order to secure the assembly panel, there is connected to the slider a retaining member with a plug-in portion which is introduced into a shaped socket portion of the assembly plane, and in that the retaining member may be secured to an attachment means connected to the switchgear cabinet.<br>
Thus, by means of the slider, the assembly panel may be firstly brought into position.  Then the retaining member is brought into an effective connection with the attachment means of the switchgear cabinet.  The guide rails can then again be removed from the inner cavity of the switchgear cabinet.  By virtue of the fact that the retaining member is inserted with a plug-in portion into a special socket means of the assembly panel, on the one hand a simple and rapid assembly of the slider<br>
is achieved, and on the other hand there is a precise alignment of the sliding surface of the slider.<br>
In order that the guide rails may again be simply dismantled after the switchgear cabinet has been fitted with the assembly panel, the assembly panel is held, in the mounted condition of the assembly panel, at a vertical spacing from the guide rail.<br>
An additional possible use results for the guide rail if it is attachable to adjacent vertical frame profiles as a transport securing means.  After transport is completed, the brace can be dismantled from the vertical frame members.  It can then be used to introduce an assembly panel into the inner cavity of the switchgear cabinet.  Built-in components can be attached to the wall aligned towards the inner cavity of the switchgear cabinet.  In particular, the guide rail may thus also be used as an assembly rail.<br>
According to a preferred variant of the invention, the wall (sliding portion) is provided with at least one row of attachment means spaced apart from one another at an identical interval, upon which electrical components may be attached.  In addition to its extra function as an assembly aid for the assembly panel, a guide rail so designed can also be used as an assembly chassis.  Thus the electrical components can be attached to the vertical frame members.<br>
By means of the positioning unit, the guide rail can be aligned and pre-positioned on the rack.<br>
A possible variant of the invention is characterised in that two arms are bent over from the wide side of the sliding portion of the guide rail, said arms merging at one end into at least one fixing lug, and in that the fixing lug is provided with a screw receiving means, by means of which it can be screwed to the vertical frame member or to the horizontal frame member.<br>
The extent of projection of the supporting portions beyond the sliding portion can be so selected that the sliding portion is located in the assembly plane formed by the profiled sides.  When used as a slide rail, the folded-over portions can be used as stops by means of which the displacement movement of the assembly panel can be restricted.  The support portions afford an opportunity of stable connection for the guide rail. This enables reliable guidance of such assembly panels, which are fitted with heavy built-in components.<br>
In order to achieve rapid and simple positioning of the guide rail, in particular at least one of the support portions is provided with the positioning units.  When the guide rail is used as a sliding guide for the assembly panel, it is sufficient to secure it to the positioning units alone.  An additional attachment, for<br><br>
example a screw connection, is not necessary, as( the transverse displacement of the guide rail is prevented by the positioning units.<br>
The invention will be explained in more detail in the following with reference to embodiments given by way of example and shown in the drawings, which show:<br>
Figure 1: a side view of a rack of a switchgear cabinet with an assembly panel,<br>
Figure 2: an enlarged view of the lower area of the rack,<br>
Figures 3a to 3c:  a guide rail as shown in Figures 1 and 2 in various views,<br>
Figure 4: a partial perspective view of a further variant of a rack with a guide rail, and<br>
Figure 5: two vertical frame members of the rack according to Figure 4 with the guide rail which may be mounted thereon.<br>
Figure 1 shows a rack 10 of a switchgear cabinet.  The rack 10 is made up of vertical and horizontal frame members 11, 13 and 15.  In this case the horizontal frame members 13, 15 respectively form an enclosed bottom or top frame 12 or 14.  An assembly panel 20 can<br>
be introduced into the interior of the switchgeap cabinet.  In the present embodiment the assembly panel 20 is pushed in through the open front side of the switchgear cabinet into the inner cavity formed by the rack 10.  The front side of the switchgear cabinet can be closed by a cabinet door, which is not shown in Figure 1 for reasons of clarity.  In order to introduce the assembly panel 20 into the switchgear cabinet, guide rails 30 are used.  These are respectively inserted into the left-hand and right-hand lower side areas of the bottom frame 12, seen from the front side of the switchgear cabinet.  Upon the guide rails 30, sliders 22 may be displaced, which are connected to the assembly panel 20.  In the assembled state, the assembly panel 20 stands perpendicular.  Insertion of the assembly panel 20 into the switchgear cabinet is indicated diagramatically by the dotted view of the assembly panel 20.  The vertical assembly panel 20 is secured at the top to the top frame 14 by means of a retaining means 21.<br>
In order to clarify the method of operation of the guide rails 30, reference is made in the following to Figures 2 to 3c.<br>
As Figure 2 shows, the guide rail 30 has a handle 31, which projects beyond the open front side of the switchgear cabinet.  Connected to the handle 31 is a support section 32, which is supported on the<br><br>
horizontal frame member 13, which extends in the, direction perpendicularly to the plane of the illustration.  Attached to the support section 32 is a positioning unit 33.  The positioning unit comprises two bolts, which are thrust into receiving means in the horizontal frame member 13.  The receiving means are formed by rows of attachment means, which extend in the longitudinal direction of the horizontal frame member 13.  The rows of attachment means are provided in the two profile sides facing the inner cavity of the switchgear cabinet.<br>
Located on the end of the guide rail 30 facing away from the handle 31 is a second positioning unit 35. This positioning unit 35 in turn comprises two bolts. The bolts are likewise thrust into the receiving means formed by the rows of attachment means.  By means of the positioning units 33 and 35, the guide rail 30 is secured in such a way that it may only be raised upwards at the handle 31.  Lateral offsetting or twisting of the guide rail 30 is excluded.<br>
The detailed design of the guide rail 30 may be seen from Figures 3a to 3c.  Figure 3a represents a side elevation, as may be seen also from Figures 1 and 2. Figure 3b is a front elevation of the left-hand side of the guide rail 30.  As may be seen from this, the guide rail 30 is U-shaped and formed by a central portion 36 and two arms 37.1, 37.2, connected thereto and spaced<br><br>
apart parallel from one another.  The bolts forming the positioning unit 35 are applied to the two arms 37.1, 37.2, and are secured thereon.<br>
Figure 3c shows a plan view of the right-hand side of the guide rail 30.  As may be seen from this, the two bolts forming the positioning unit 33 are secured to the underside of the support section 32.  For this purpose the bolts are welded securely to the central portion 36.<br>
As may further be seen from Figure 2, a retaining member 22 is connected to the slider 23.  The retaining member 22 has a plug-in portion 25, which is inserted into a correspondingly shaped socket means 20.1 of the assembly panel 20.  For this purpose the assembly panel 20 has on the front side a plate 27, which has an angled portion 29 bent over backwards.  A web 28 is bent over parallel to the plate 27 from the angled portion 29.  Between the plate 27, the angled portion 29 and the web 28 there is formed the plug-in receiving means 20.1 for the plug-in portion 25.  The plug-in portion 25 is hollow, so that a receiving means 26 results.  This receiving means 26 serves for securing the assembly panel 20 on the rack 10.  An attachment means 41 engages into the receiving means 26, which is open only in a downward direction, said attachment means 41 in the present case being in the form of a chamfered bolt.  The attachment means 41 is secured to<br><br>
a cross brace 40 by means of screw attachment 42(.  The cross brace 40 extends in the direction of the width of the switchgear cabinet.<br>
In order to insert the assembly panel 20 into the inner cavity of the switchgear cabinet, said panel is firstly mounted with its slider 23 on the handle 31 outside the switchgear cabinet.  Then the assembly panel can be obliquely positioned, which is enabled by the curved contour of the slider 23.  Now the assembly panel can be inserted through the open front side into the switchgear panel.  In this case the slider 23 slides on the sliding portion 34.  In order to prevent the slider 23 from slipping laterally from the guide rail 30, guides 24 are used.  These are connected to the retaining member 22.<br>
Once the assembly panel 20 reaches its intended position, it can be set upright.  In this case the attachment member 41 enters the receiving means 26. The cross brace 40 is inserted into the switchgear cabinet at a slightly higher level than the guide rail 30.  Thus, when the assembly panel 20 is set upright, there results a vertical spacing between the lower end of the assembly panel and the guide rail 30.  Thus the guide rail 30 may be easily removed from the inner cavity of the switchgear cabinet.  It need only be raised by the handle 31, so that the bolts of the positioning unit 33 are lifted out of the receiving<br><br>
means.  Then the guide rail 30 can be pulled out( via the open front side from the switchgear cabinet.  In this case the bolts of the second positioning unit 35 emerge from the corresponding receiving means.  For final fixing, the assembly panel 20 is secured to the retaining means 21 as shown in Figure 1.<br>
The guide rail 30 is more appropriately formed from a stamped, bent part.  In order to achieve good sliding properties, it is recommended that the slider 23 be made of a plastic material.  The slider 23 can be manufactured together with the retaining member 22 and the plug-in portion 25 as a plastics injection moulded part.<br>
Figure 4 shows a portion of a rack which is made up of frame members.  In this case the horizontal frame members 13 are in the form of width and depth braces. The width braces and the depth braces form a bottom frame 12, to the corner areas of which the vertical frame members 11 are connected.  The width braces and depth braces are identical constructionally.  They have two profile sides 11.1, 12.1 facing the inner cavity of the rack.  Said profile sides stand at right angles to one another.  The first profile side 11.1 is at right angles to the facing side wall of the rack.  The second profile side 12.1 extends parallel to the side wall. Inserted in the profile sides 11.1, 12.1 are rows of attachment means 13.1, 14 spaced apart from one another<br><br>
at identical intervals.  The first profile side J.1.1 carries two rows of attachment means 13.1, 14.  The second profile side 12.1 on the other hand is provided with only one row.  Bores 13a are produced in the profile sides 11.1, 12.1 between the individual attachment means 13.1, 14.<br>
The vertical frame members 11 are respectively provided with four profile sides 15.1, 15.2.  The arrangement of the profile sides 15.1, 15.2 can be seen in more detail from Figure 5.  As this Figure shows, two first profile sides 15.1 respectively stand perpendicular to the associated sides of the rack.  Connecting with these first profile sides 15.1 and right angles are the second profile sides 15.2.  Each of the profile sides 15.1, 15.2 is provided with a row of attachment means 15.3.  Bores 15.4 are in turn located between these.<br>
With reference to Figure 4, the design of a guide rail 30 will be explained in more detail in the following, which can be secured to the opposite width braces.  The guide rail 30 has a sliding portion 34, provided with a row of attachment means 21.1.  At their longitudinal-side ends, the respective sliding portion 34 are provided with an angled portion 23.1.  The angled portion 23.1 extends transversely to the longitudinal extension of the guide rail 30.  The angled portion 23.1 carries a support section.  The angled portion 23.1 holds the support section 24.1, 32 above the plane<br><br>
formed by the sliding portion 34.  The support sections 24.1, 32 are respectively provided with an elongate slot 24.11, 25.1.  Two positioning units 33, formed as plug-in projections, are stamped out and angled downwards at right angles from the forward support section 32.<br>
Two arms 37.1, 27.2 are bent over downwards from the wide sides of the sliding portion 34 of the guide rail 30.  At their end facing the support section 32, the arms 37.1, 37.2 have fixing projections 25.3.  The fixing projections 25.3 are bent over at right angles from the side arms 22 and are provided with screw receiving means 25.4.<br>
At the end facing the support section 24.1, a tab is cut out and bent inwards.  This tab forms a positioning unit 35, 24.3.<br>
The guide rail 30 can be used as an assembly aid for an assembly panel.  For this purpose it is secured to the width braces 10.1 which are parallel to one another. For attachment, the guide rail 30 is firstly thrust with its positioning unit 35 into one of the attachment means 14 of the profile side 12.1 of the rear width brace (assembly step 1).  As the clear width of the attachment means 14 is greater than the thickness of the material of the positioning unit 35, the latter can be offset vertically in the attachment means 14.  This<br><br>
simplifies attachment of the guide rail 30 to the width brace.  When the positioning unit 35 is pushed downwards in the attachment means 14, the support section 24.1 abuts on the first profile side 11.1.  The elongate slots 24.11 in the support section 24.1 is then flush with one of the bores 13a.<br>
Then the guide rail 30 can be folded down, the positioning unit 33 engaging in attachment means 13.1 on the first profile side 11.1 of the forward width brace.  The folding movement of the guide rail 30 is limited by the support section 32, which abuts on the profile side 11.1.  The clear opening width of the attachment means 13.1 transversely to the longitudinal extension of the width brace 10.1 is selected to be greater than the thickness of the material of the positioning unit 33.  Thus the guide rail 30 may be displaced to a limited degree with respect to its longitudinal axis.  Due to this measure, simple and rapid assembly is possible.  In addition, manufacturing tolerances can be compensated for.  The guide rail 30 thus mounted may also be secured by an attachment member 15.5.  The attachment member 15.5 is in the form of a self-tapping screw, which is introduced into the elongate slot 25.1 and screwed into the bore 13a.<br>
An assembly panel can be displaced in the direction of the depth of the switchgear cabinet on the sliding<br><br>
portion 34.  The displacement movement can in thjLs case be limited by the bent-over portion 23.1<br>
In its second function, the guide rail 30 can also be used as a transport securing means.  For this purpose it is screwed to two adjoining vertical frame profiles 11.  This built-in situation can be seen in detail from Figure 5.  As this Figure shows, the guide rail 30 is firstly thrust with its positioning units 35 into two adjacent attachment means 15.3 of the profile side 15.1 of the rear vertical frame profile 11.  Then the support section 32 can be laid on to the profile side 15.2 of the forward vertical frame profile 11.  In order to secure the guide rail, the attachment member 15.5 is screwed into the bore 15.4.  The guide rail 30 may be additionally secured via the elongate slot 24.11 in the support flange 24.1.  Likewise, a screw connection can be produced to the forward vertical frame profile 1 by means of the screw receiving means 25.4 of the fixing projections 25.3.  A further function of the guide rail 30 results with the attachment means 21.1, which are inserted in the sliding portion 34.  Thus the guide rail 30 may be used as an assembly chassis, on which electrical components are mounted which can also be kept in the interior of the rack.<br>
When using the guide rail 30 as an assembly aid for the assembly panel, its alignment can be so selected that<br><br>
the assembly panel can be displaced either vertipally to the rear wall of the rack or parallel thereto.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
