TNVFMTT.QJJ FIFTH   OF   THF   TNVFNTTOJJ<br>
The present invention relates to a cutting method and a cutter apparatus for cutting a coil conductor to be used, for  example,   in  an   armature  coil   of   an  engine   starter.<br>
DESCRIPTION  OF  THE  RELATED  ART<br>
Fig. 7      schematically      shows      the      construction      of      a<br>
conventional    cutter    apparatus    for    coil    conductor    such    as<br>
disclosed    in    Japanese    Patent    Publication    No.62-48471.       In<br>
this    figure,    a    coil    conductor    2    having    a    circular    cross<br>
section   contained   in   a   bobbin   1   is   drawn   out   from   the   bobbin<br>
1    by   a   predetermined   amount   by   means   of    feed   roller   3   and<br>
then  is  brought   to  a  halt.     Insulating   film on  its  periphery<br>
is   scraped   off   for   a   range   of   length   2L   by   a   helical   reamer<br>
4.        Thereafter,     the    coil    conductor    2    is    severed    at    the<br>
center   of   the   2L   range   by   a   pair   of   cutting   edges    5A,    5B.<br>
Thus,    as   shown   in   Fig.8,    of    the   severed   coil   conductor    2,<br>
the   insulating   film   has   been   scraped   off    for   a   length   L   at<br>
each   of    both   end   portions.      Further,    the   coil    conductor    2<br>
drawn   out    from   the   bobbin    1    is    removed   of    its    warping   by<br>
straightening  roller   6.<br>
The severed coil conductor 2 is formed into a shape for example shown in Fig.9 and is inserted into a slot 7a of an armature core 7 as shown in Fig.10. Thereafter, as shown in Fig.11, the portion of the coil conductor 2 penetrating through  the   armature   core   7   is   formed   and   the   portions   with<br>
'   -"ff   are   connected  to  a<br><br>
commentator   8.       In   this   manner,    the   armature   for   an   engine starter   is  assembled.<br>
Fig.12 schematically illustrates the method of cutting by the apparatus of Fig.7. A terminal end of the coil conductor 2 is grasped by a catcher so that it may be advanced. Cutting edges 5A, 5B are connected to driving shafts llA, 11B through cutting eccentric cam mechanisms   10B, respectively. Rotation of the driving shafts 11A, 11B is converted into a linear movement of the cutting edges 5A,   5B   by   the   cutting   eccentric   cam  mechanisms   10A,    108.<br>
Fig.13 is an enlarged view showing the state of cutting the coil conductor of Fig.12. The cutting edges 5A, 5B are moved in the direction perpendicular to the feeding direction of the coil conductor 2 so as to cut the coil conductor 2. Further, the tool angle at each of the cutting edges 5A, 5B is 90. The reason for this is that the both end portions of the coil conductor 2 after the severance are sharpened so that its insertion into the slot 7a of the armature   core   7   is   smooth.<br>
In the conventional cutting method of the coil conductor 2 as described above, though feeding of the coil conductor 2 comes to a halt at the time of its cutting, since the cutting edges 5A, 5B are moved perpendicularly with respect to the coil conductor 2, the coil conductor 2 located upstream of the cutting edges 5A, 5B is pressed toward the direction opposite to its feeding by the tool surfaces of the cutting edges 5A, 58. At this time, since moving of the coil conductor 2 toward the direction opposite to its feeding is restricted by the feed roller 3, the coil conductor   2   is   deflected   as   shown   in   Fig. 13   to   result   in   a<br><br>
bending of the coil conductor 2 or unstable dimensions of the coil conductor 2 after the severance. Further, a pressing force is exerted to the cutting edges 5A, 5B from the coil conductor 2, causing a premature wear or noise of the   cutting  edges   5A,   5B.<br>
On the other hand, the coil conductor 2 downstream of the cutting edges 5A, 5B, though it is pushed in the direction of its feeding when being cut, causes no problem, since the catcher 9 does not restrict the movement in the feeding  direction  of   the   coil   conductor   2.<br>
SUMMARY  OF   THE   INVENTION<br>
To solve the above problems, it is an object of the present invention to provide a cutting method and a cutter apparatus for coil conductor in which deformation of the coil   conductor  may   be  prevented.<br>
In one aspect of the present invention, a cutting method for coil conductor includes the steps of: halting a coil conductor after feeding it by a predetermined amount; and, while feeding cutting edges downstream along the coil conductor, cutting the halted coil conductor by the cutting edges.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, a cutter apparatus for coil conductor comprises: cutting means having cutting edges for cutting a coil conductor halted after being fed by a predetermined amount; and feed means for feeding the cutting edges downstream of the coil conductor when cutting the  coil   conductor  by  the  cutting  means.<br>
In a further aspect of the invention, a cutter apparatus for   coil   conductor   comprises:   a   cutting   edge   for   cutting   a<br><br>
coil conductor halted after being fed by a predeterminea amount; a guide member disposed diagonally with respect to the coil conductor for guiding the cutting edge diagonally downstream of the coil conductor when cutting the coil conductor; and driving means for moving the cutting edge along  the  guide  member.<br>

DESCRIPTION   OF   THE   PREFERRED   EMBODIMENTS<br>
An embodiment of the present invention will be described below with reference to the drawings. Fig.l is a schematic view illustrating a cutting method for a coil conductor according to an embodiment of the present invention. Fig.2 shows in an enlarged manner the state where the coil conductor  of   Fig.l   has   been   cut.<br>
In these figures, cutting eccentric cam mechanisms 10A, lOB for causing cutting operation of cutting edges 5A, 58, are linked with each other and are capable of simultaneously moving along driving shafts 11A, 11B, respectively. A feeding crank mechanism 12 for moving the cutting eccentric cam mechanisms 10A, 10B along the driving shafts 11A, 1 IB is connected to the driving shaft 11B through a set of bevel gears   13,    14.<br>
The cutting means is constituted generally by the cutting edges 5A, 5B, cutting eccentric cam mechanisms IDA, lOB and driving shafts 11A, 11B. Further, the feed means is constituted generally by the feeding crank mechanism 12 and the   bevel   gears   13,   14.<br>
Here, the cutting edges 5A, 5B sever the coil conductor 2    while    traveling    in    the    feeding    direction    of    the    coil<br><br>
conductor 2 at an angle of 45. In other words, as shown also in Fig.2, since the tool angle of each of the cutting edges 5A, 5B is 90, the cutting edges 5A, 5B are moved along the tool surface on the upstream side of the coil conductor 2   when  the   coil   conductor   2   is  being  cut.<br>
Accordingly, a force pushing back the coil conductor 2 does not occur at the time of cutting, so that deformation of the coil conductor 2 is prevented and the dimensions of the coil conductor 2 is stabilized. Further, no pushing force is exerted to the cutting edges 5A, 5B from the coil conductor 2, thereby preventing a premature wear or an occurrence   of   noise  of   the   cutting   edges   5A,   58.<br>
It should be noted that, while the traveling angle of the cutting edges 5A, 58 is set to 45 in the example of Fig.2, it is also possible to move them at an angle, for example 60 as shown in Fig. 3, which is larger than the .angle between the tool surface and the coij. conductor 2. Although a little more pressing force against the coil conductor 2 is added comparing to the example of Fig.2, deformation of the coil conductor 2 is prevented when comparing to the conventional example shown in Fig.13. Further, it is also possible to move them at an angle smaller than the angle between the tool surface and the coil conductor 2. However, if the traveling angle is set equal to the angle between the tool surface and the coil conductor 2, no useless pressing or tensile force is applied to the coil conductor 2, an increase in space due to an excessive feed is prevented and a  smooth  cut  surface   is  achieved.<br>
Further,   Fig.4   shows   an   example   where   the   cutting   edges 5C,   5D  having   a  tool   angle   ~*   '^'^   "'■■^  ..COH   and  +h«»  traveling<br><br>
angle   is   set   to   70.      In   this   manner,   various   modifications of   the  tool  angle  and  traveling  angle  are  possible.<br>
Furthermore, cross section of the coil conductor 2 is not limited to a circle and, for example, it may have a rectangular section. However, while a conductor having a rectangular cross section may be cut also by a shearing force, the coil conductor 2 having a circular section must be cut by using the cutting edges 5A, 5B having a triangular edge and application of the present invention thereto is particularly  effective.<br>
The construction of a cutter apparatus of the present invention will now be described in detail. Fig.5 is a sectional view showing the detailed construction of the cutter apparatus of Fig.1. In this figure, sliding keys 21A, 21B extended in the axial direction are provided, respectively, on the driving shafts 11A, 11B which are parallel to each other and are attached to a base (not shown)   so  that   they   cannot   be  moved   in  the   axial   direction.<br>
An eccentric cam body 22 is attached for a sliding movement on the driving shaft 11A. Further, the eccentric cam body 22 is rotated integrally with the driving shaft 11A. The eccentric cam body 22 is accommodated in a housing 23. A needle bearing 24 for allowing rotation of the eccentric cam body 22 within the housing 23 is provided between the housing 23 and the cam body 22. A connector 26 is linked with the housing 23 through a pin 25. The cutting eccentric cam mechanism 10A includes the eccentric cam body 22,   housing   23,   needle   bearing   24,   pin   25   and  connector   26.<br>
One   end   portion   of   the   connector   26   is   inserted   into   a<br>
spring   	   ''^        *   «:iide   adiuster   28   and   a   disc   spring   29<br><br>
are accommodated in the spring case 27. A cutter adjusting bracket 30 adjacent to the spring case 27 is being pushed by the disc spring 29. A cutter adjusting wedge 31 is provided between a cutting edge holder 32 for holding the cutting edge  5A  and  the  cutter  adjusting  bracket   30.<br>
A housing 33 is provided on the outer periphery of both axial end portions of the eccentric cam body 22 through a needle bearing 34. A pair of side plates 35, 36 facing each other are attached to the housing 33 and the members connected between the eccentric cam body 22 and the cutting edge 5A are accommodated between these side plates 35, 36. A slider 37 is disposed respectively between the side plates 35,   36   and   the   cutter   holder   32.<br>
Since the structure for mounting the cutting edge 5B to the driving shaft 11B is identical to that for the cutting edge   5A,   a   descript,ion  thereof   will   be   omitted.<br>
The side plates 35, 36 are provided in a manner extended between the driving shafts 11A, 11B. A line guide 38 serving as an inlet for the coil conductor 2 (Fig.1) is mounted on the center portion of the side plate 35. Further, an outlet 36a for the coil conductor 2 is provided at   the   center   portion  of   the   side   plate   36.<br>
A bevel gear 14 is provided on the driving shaft 11B. The bevel gear 14 and the bevel gear 13 for meshing with the bevel gear 14 are accommodated in a gear case 41. Sleeves 42, 43 for restricting the axial movement of the bevel gear 14 are attached to the driving shaft 11B. Housings 44, 45 are mounted on both end portions of the gear case 41. A ball bearing 46 is provided between the housing 44 and the sleeve    42.       A    thrust    bearing    47    is    provided    between    the<br><br>
housing     45     and    the    sleeve    43.        A    bearing    holder     14    is attached  to  an   axial   end  portion  of   the   housing   45.<br>
The bevel gear 13 is firmly fixed to one end portion of a shaft 51 which is extended in a direction perpendicular to the driving shaft 11B. An eccentric shaft 52 is provided on the other end portion of the shaft 51. A Power lOCk 53 for adjusting timing is provided between the eccentric shaft 52 and the other end portion of the shaft 51. A stepped pin 54 is fixed to an eccentric position with respect to the rotating center of the eccentric shaft 52 in parallel to both  the   shaft   51   and   eccentric   shaft   52.<br>
A rod 55 is rotatably connected to the stepped pin 54 through a rod end bearing 56. A pin holder 57 is connected to the terminal end portion of the rod end bearing 56 through a hinge pin 58 and a rod end bearing 59. The pin holder   57   is   fixed  to  the   side   plate   35.<br>
The feed crank mechanism 12 thus includes the shaft 51, eccentric shaft 52, Power lock 53, stepped pin 54, rod 55, rod end bearing 56, pin holder 57, hinge pin 58 and rod end bearing   59.<br>
In the cutter apparatus as described above, by rotating the' dri\nng shafts 11A, 11B, the cutting edges 5A, 5B are moved in the left and right direction as shown in Fig. 5 to cut the coil conductor 2. At this time, the bevel gear 14 is rotated together with the driving shaft 11B, so as to rotate the bevel gear 13 and the shaft 51. Upon rotation of the shaft 51, the rod 55 is moved in an up and down direction as shown in Fig.5, and the side plate 35 is moved up   and   down    as    shown    in   Fig. 5    through   the   pin    58    and   pin<br><br>
Since the side plate 35 is provided between the two cutting eccentric cam mechanisms lOA, 10B, the cutting eccentric cam mechanisms 10A, 10B and the cutting edges 5A, 5B as a whole are moved along the driving shafts 11A, 11B. Accordingly, by suitably setting amount of eccentricity of the eccentric cam body 22 of the cutting eccentric cam mechanism 10A, lOB and amount of eccentricity of the stepped pin 54 of the feed crank mechanism 12, timing of the cutting operation of the cutting edges 5A, 5B and operation timing of the rod 55 are previously adjusted to achieve their synchronization. It is thereby possible to perform a feed-in  operation  of   the   cutting   edges   5A,   58  as   shown   in  Fig.1.<br>
In order to achieve a balanced movement of the left and right cutting eccentric cam mechanisms 10A, 100, the pin holder 57 is preferably disposed near the center of the side pl.ate 35 which serves as the connecting portion between the cutting  eccentric   cam  mechanisms   lOA,    lOB.<br>
Further, while, in the above embodiment, the cutting operation and the feed-in operation are mechanically linked by using the bevel gears 13, 14, such driving link may be provided by other mechanism. Further, it is also possible to electrically control each of the cutting operation and the feeding operation to achieve their coordinated movement without   a  mechanical   linkage.<br>
Fig.6 is a schematic sectional view showing a cutter<br>
apparatus for coil conductor according to another embodiment<br>
of     the     present     invention.	In     this     figure,     a     cutting<br>
operation i_s performed by a pair of cutting edges 60A, 60B having a tool angle of 90 as they are moved diagonally downstream      with      re^iri^rt      to      the      coil       conductor      2,<br><br>
respectively,  by  air  cylinders  61 A,   618  each  serving  as  both  . |&gt;* a  guide  member   and   a  driving  means.      The   air   cylinders   61A, 61B  are  each  disposed   at   an  angle  of   45  with  respect  to  the coil   conductor   2.<br>
The construction of such apparatus is simple, since the cutting edges 60A, 60B directly receive the driving force from  the  air  cylinders   61A,   61B.<br><br><br>
