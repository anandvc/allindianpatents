(See section 10 and rule 13)<br>
TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
"NOVEL MEDICINAL CAPSULES CONTAINING AT LEAST TWO DRUGS HAVING MULTIPLE RELEASE PROFILES METHODS FOR<br>
MANUFACTURE THEREOF"<br>
We, CADILA HEALTHCARE LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956 of "Zydus Tower", Satellite Cross Roads, Ahmedabad - 380 015, Gujarat, India.<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
Field of invention<br>
The present invention relates to a novel medicinal capsule containing at least two drugs having multiple release profiles as well as encapsulation process for providing multiple release profiles of ingredients. <br>
Background of the invention<br>
Filling of liquids into gelatin capsules has been a commercial practice in pharmaceutical manufacturing. The gelatin capsules are either soft gelatin capsules or hard gelatin capsules. However, filling of two layers for achieving different release patterns of the drugs contained therein is not possible with soft gelatin capsules using current technology. Two layered filling for achieving different release patterns of the drugs contained therein has not been reported before using hard gelatin capsules. <br>
Objects of the invention<br>
It is therefore, an important object of the present invention to provide two or more but at least two drugs in a single capsule having identical or multiple release profiles. Summary of the invention<br>
This invention discloses a process for the preparation of a liquid-filled hard gelatin capsule containing two or more layers capable of independently controlling the release of the drugs contained therein. The invention also relates the hard gelatin capsules containing at least two drugs exhibiting multiple release profiles.<br>
The expression "multiple release profile" in the context of the present invention simply means that two or more drugs which may be present in the capsule have their own release profiles which are independent of each other. Such release profile may be sustained release for one and immediate release for the other or immediate release for both or sustained release for both.<br>
The invention is based on the discovery that with judicious manipulation of LabrafH M1944CS, Liquid Paraffin, Bees Wax, Loratadinc, and polyethylene glycol, particularly, PEG 400 and PEG 6000, a gelatin capsule containing at least two drugs with multiple release profiles may be obtained. In other words, the invention relates to a gelatin medicinal capsules containing at least two drugs with the following properties:<br>
1. A combination of release patterns - one layer designed for immediate release of the drug contained therein and the other layer designed for sustained release of the drug contained therein.<br>
2<br><br>
2.	Both   layers  providing   sustained  release   of the   drugs   contained   there   in respectively.<br>
3.	Both  layers  providing  immediate  release  of the  drugs   contained  there   in respectively.<br>
Thus, according to the present invention, there is provided a medicinal capsule containing at least two drugs having multiple release profiles, said first drug exhibiting immediate release while the second drug exhibiting delayed release said capsule comprising of a bottom layer consisting of said second drug dispersed in mixture of labrafll, liquid paraffin and bees wax and a top layer consisting of said first drug dispersed in a mixture of polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG 400) and polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG 6000).<br>
Preferably, the first drug comprises loratidine and said second drug comprises pseudoephedrine sulfate.<br>
The present invention also provides a method for the manufacture of a medicinal capsule containing at least two drugs having multiple release profiles, said first drug exhibiting immediate release while the second drug exhibiting delayed release said method comprising melting a mixture of labrafll, liquid paraffin and bees wax, adding to said melt said second drug and allowing it to cool, melting a mixture of PEG 400 and PEG 6000, dispersing said first drug in said mixture and allowing it to cool, filling said mixture containing said second drug in a capsule to form a bottom layer containing said second drug and filling the mixture containing said first drug to form a top layer containing said first drug and sealing said capsule.<br>
Preferably, said mixtures are allowed to cool to a temperature of about 37Â±2^C In another preferred feature, said bottom layer is allowed to cool to room temperature before the addition of said top layer.<br>
Preferably, said capsule is sealed with aqueous gelatin solution.<br>
In another embodiment, the present invention provides a medicinal capsule containing at least two drugs having multiple release profiles, both said drugs exhibiting delayed release said capsule comprising of a bottom layer consisting of said second drug dispersed in mixture of melted hard paraffin and liquid Paraffin and a top layer consisting of said first drug dispersed in propylene glycol.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the present invention provides a medicinal capsule containing at least two drugs having multiple release profiles, both said drugs exhibiting<br>
3<br><br>
delayed release said capsule comprising of a bottom layer consisting of said second drug dispersed in mixture of melted labrafil, liquid paraffin and bees and a top layer consisting of said first drug dispersed in propylene glycol. <br>
Detailed description<br>
The   present   invention   will   now   be   described   using   two   model   drugs, pseudoephedirne and loratadine with reference to the accompanying drawings and following examples. In the drawings,<br>
Fig 1. shows the dissolution pattern of Loratidine and Pseudoephedrine, wherein the former exhibits immediate release pattern while the latter exhibits delayed release.<br>
Fig. 2. shows the dissolution pattern of Loratidine and Pseudoephedrine, wherein both the drugs exhibit delayed release profiles.<br>
Fig. 3 shows the dissolution pattern of Loratidine and Pseudoephedrine, wherein both the drugs exhibit delayed release.<br>
Fig. 4. shows the dissolution pattern of Loratidine and Pseudoephedrine, wherein the former exhibits immediate release while the latter exhibits delayed release.<br>
Fig. 5 shows the dissolution pattern of Loratidine and Pseudoephedrine, wherein the former exhibits immediate release while the latter exhibits delayed release.<br>
Fig. 6. shows the dissolution pattern of Loratidine and Pseudoephedrine, wherein the former exhibits immediate release while the latter exhibits delayed release.<br>
Fig. 7 shows the dissolution pattern of Loratidine and Pseudoephedrine, wherein the former exhibits immediate release while the latter exhibits delayed release.<br>

Total	465 mg<br>
Weighed quantities of labrafil, liquid paraffin and bees wax were transferred into a beaker and melted on a hot water bath. Weighed quantity of pseudoephedrine sulfate was transferred into above mixture and stirred well. The mixture was allowed to cool to<br>
37Â±2Â°C. Weighed quantities of PEG 400 and PEG 6000 were transferred in a beaker and melted on a hot water bath.  Loratadine was dispersed in the mixture and allowed to cool<br>
to 37Â±2^C. Pseudoephedrine layer was filled into size 1 capsule and allowed to cool to room temperature. Thereafter, loratadine layer was filled in the capsule. The filled capsule was sealed using aqueous gelatin solution.<br>
Dissolution test : The release of the two drugs was monitored by a dissolution test at 37Â°C using water as the dissolution and apparatus 1 at 50 RPM.<br>
Results : The dissolution of loratadine was 98.8% in 60 min., as any immediate release formulation and that of pseudoephedrine was 61.4% at 12h as shown in Figure 1.<br>
Example 2<br>
A - Pseudoepnedirne Layer<br><br>
