				<td>SIDE WALL FOR AN INK FOUNTAIN OF A PRINTING MACHINE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a side wall of an ink fountain of a printing machine, comprising at least two plates fixed some distance apart, and an intermediate plate having a front edge in the shape of an arc of a circle mounted between said plates in such a way that it can be moved and tilted, and press means acting on said intermediate plate.<br>
The present invention also relates to an ink fountain for a printing machine comprising at least one side wall according to the present invention.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Such walls and ink fountains are known in the state of the art. For example, US Patent 5,230,286 describes an ink fountain for a printing machine, the side walls of which are in contact with the ink fountain roller to form the radial seal of the ink fountain. In this state of the art, the front edge of the side walls, which has the overall shape of an arc of a circle, does not press effectively against the ink fountain roller except at the ends of the arc of the circle, while that part of the front edge which lies between these ends does not touch the roller, a slot thus formed not, however, being wide enough to allow ink to pass through it.<br>
Nonetheless, it has been found, in use, that this type of seal was not satisfactory. This is because the inks used are often abrasive and therefore merely an imperfect seal is enough for the escaping ink to quickly destroy the seal by wearing away the front edge of the walls which form the seal. In the abovementioned case in particular, the fact that the seal is in contact with the roller only at its ends and not over its intermediate part allows ink to escape through the slot and premature wear of the seal thus occurs.<br>
Patent EP 0 374 092 discloses another ink fountain system comprising partition walls allowing printing with different colors. These partition walls comprise, in particular, two metal plates and an intermediate plate with a front edge in contact with the periphery of the ink fountain roller, producing sealed contact therewith. The metal plates for their part have a plastic bead along their lower edge in order to seal against the partition wall and the bottom of the ink fountain. The drawback of this system lies in the fact that the seal between the intermediate wall and the periphery of the ink fountain roller is not perfect either and that the life of the system is thus limited because of the abrasive properties of the inks which wear away the elements of the system, particularly the intermediate plate.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The purpose of the present invention is to improve the known devices.<br>
More specifically, the object of the present invention is to provide an ink fountain in which the sealing of the side walls is markedly improved, and to do so in a simple manner and at fairly low cost.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a system which can be retrofitted to existing machines, that is to say a system which can be mounted in ink fountains which are already in service without major modification thereto.<br>
These objects are achieved by the characteristics of the characterizing part of claim 1.<br>
The side wall according to the invention makes it possible to markedly improve the sealing of the seal and therefore to greatly lengthen its life. On account of its simplicity, the system is easy and inexpensive to produce and can be fitted to machines which are already in operation.<br>
The dependent claims 2 to 8 define particular embodiments of the side wall according to the present invention.<br>
Independent claim 9 defines an ink fountain comprising at least one side wall according to the present invention.<br>
Dependent claim 10 defines a particular embodiment of the ink fountain.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
The invention will be better understood from the detailed description of one embodiment thereof and from the figures which relate to it.<br>
Figure 1 diagrammatically shows an inking device comprising two ink fountains;<br>
Figure 2 shows a view in part section of a side wall of an ink fountain, from the inside of the ink fountain, and<br>
Figure 3 shows a view from above in section on the axis III-III of the side wall of said Figure 2.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S)<br>
Figure 1 depicts an inking device with two superposed ink fountains, of the type used in intaglio printing machines. This device is made up mainly of a mobile linking carriage 1, comprising two superposed frames 2, each frame 2 being equipped with an ink fountain 3 formed of a bottom 4 and of two side walls 5 collaborating with the ink fountain roller 6. The bottom 4 is formed of a blade, the front edge of which is close to the ink fountain roller 6. To illustrate one application of this ink fountain 3, Figure 1 also diagrammatically depicts inking rollers 7 which, for example, ink impression plates (not depicted) mounted in a plate cylinder 8.<br>
Figure 2 is a detailed depiction of a side wall 5 seen from inside the ink fountain 3.<br>
This side wall 5 comprises a slideway 10 which is mounted on the bottom of the ink fountain 3, for example by a screw-fastening using screws 29. The front end of the slideway 10 which is on the inside of the ink fountain 3 is in contact with the ink fountain roller 6. The slideway 10 at this point has a reinforcement 12, such as a small plate of hard material, for example metal or ceramic, which completely seals the joint between this wedge shape and the roller 6.<br>
Specifically, as the front edge of the slideway is in contact with the periphery of the ink fountain roller 6, the sharp edge of the slide way is blunted because of the abrasive properties of the ink, which means that ink can run near the seal with the side wall 5. Thus, to improve the sealing of this seal, a housing is milled on the inside end of the slideway, in which housing the small plate of hard material 12 is fixed, and wear is markedly reduced.<br>
The side wall 5 itself comprises a first plate 11 which slides without play in said slideway 10, from the opposite end to the ink fountain roller 6. Mounted next on this first plate is an intermediate plate 13, the front edge 13a of which is in the shape of an arc of a circle and which plate is intended to come into contact with the circumference of the ink fountain roller 6. This intermediate plate is generally made of plastic, for example Nylatron, and provides for the sealing of the side wall 5 along the circumference of the ink fountain roller 6.<br>
This intermediate plate 13 can move longitudinally, in the direction perpendicular to the axis of rotation of the ink fountain roller 6 or in terms of rotation about an axis parallel to the axis of rotation of the ink fountain roller 6 and is kept pressed against the ink fountain roller 6 by means of the two springs 18 and 19, placed in corresponding cavities 20, 21 in the first plate 11. The axis of rotation of the intermediate plate 13 is close<br>
to or even coincident with the axis of a screw 24, depending on the longitudinal position of the intermediate plate 13. Furthermore, the two springs 18 and 19 are located one on each side of this axis of rotation of the intermediate plate 13. As a preference, the two springs 18, 19 may be preloaded by screws 22, 23. To protect the rear portion 13b of the intermediate plate 13 on which the two springs 18, 19 act, a small protective plate 15 is placed on said rear portion 13b, and held in place, for example using screws 16 and 17.<br>
A second plate 14 is fixed to the first plate 11 by the screws 24, 26 and serves both to close the device and to protect the intermediate plate 13 from the ink, particularly as the latter is drying. Thus, the intermediate plate still slides correctly even if the ink has thickened or dried, and the ink fountain remains sealed.<br>
To hold the side wall 5 in place in the slideway 10, use is made of a screw 25, the end of which may be knurled to make it easier to tighten and slacken by hand.<br>
To ensure a perfect seal, that is to say the absence of play, between the small plate made of hard material 12 and the intermediate plate 13, it is necessary to provide a special system for adjusting the position of the intermediate plate 13 sideways with respect to the slideway 10. One embodiment of this system is depicted in detail in Figure 3 and comprises two inclined planes which collaborate in the manner of a wedge. A first inclined plane 30 is formed on the inside of the first plate 11 and a second inclined plane is formed on an intermediate part 31 which moves with respect to the first plate 11 by sliding along the first inclined plane 30, thus allowing the intermediate plate 13 to be adjusted sideways in the direction of the small plate of hard material 12 and allowing play to be eliminated. The wedge system is locked in place by the screws 27 which pass through oblong holes 28 in the intermediate part 31 and screw into the first plate 11.<br>
The wedge system can be adjusted by hand, by adjusting the position of the intermediate plate 13 toward the piece of hard material 12, little by little, or alternatively, use may be made of a system involving a cam 32 mounted on an axle fixed to the first plate 11 and actuated by the screw 33, the cam 32 acting on the intermediate part 31 so as to move it longitudinally in a direction perpendicular to the axis of the ink fountain roller 6 and thus, via the wedge system, move the intermediate plate 13 toward the piece of hard material 12.<br>
To hold the intermediate plate 13 between the plates 11 and 14, the intermediate plate 13 is pierced with a hole through which a bushing 35 passes (see Figure 3). This bushing 35 is itself held in position by screws 24 and 33 which pass through the plates 14 and 11 respectively.<br>
The embodiment described is described by way of example and the side wall on the other side of the ink fountain 3 may be constructed in the same way as the one described hereinabove but as a symmetric inversion, so that the piece of hard material 12 and the plate 15 are on the inside of the ink fountain 3.<br>
Furthermore, the invention is not restricted to the embodiment described and variations may be made within the scope of the claimed protection. For example, the intermediate plate may be adjusted sideways by other means equivalent to the wedge system described.<br>
The materials used, particularly those of the small plate 12 and intermediate plate 13 which forms the seal may be varied.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
