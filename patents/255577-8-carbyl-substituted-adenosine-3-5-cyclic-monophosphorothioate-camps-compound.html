				<td>Purine Nucleotide Derivatives<br>
This invention relates to novel purine nucleotide derivatives, to processes for their preparation, intermediates in their preparation, compositions containing them, their use in medicine and diagnostics, and to methods of treatment and assay methods using them, in particular where the purine nucleotide derivative is a purine cyclic monophosphate phosphorothioate substituted at the 8-carbon of the purine ring by a carbon-attached substituent.<br>
The naturally occuring purine cyclic monophosphates, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), are messenger molecules important for mediating the effects on cell function of hormones.<br>
It has been proposed that analogs of such cyclic nucleotides may be used in treating disease states associated with reduced or enhanced immune function. Thus one such analog is adenosine cyclic monophosphorothioate (cAMPS), or more exactly adenosine 3',5'- cyclic monophosphorothioate, in which one of the oxygens pendant from the phosphorus atom is replaced by a sulphur.  The phosphorus as a result is a chiral centre and in the Rp configuration (at the phosphorus atom) cAMPS is a cAMP antagonist while in the Sp configuration (at the phosphorus atom) it is a cAMP agonist.  The use of Rp- cAMPS as a cAMP antagonist as part of an HIV treatment has been proposed for example in WO98/48809 and the use of cAMPS as an inhibitor of neoplastic growth has been proposed in US-A-5843916.<br>
W098/48809 suggested in particular the use of cAMP antagonists which inhibit the activity of the enzyme cAMP-dependent protein kinase I (PKAI) and in this<br><br>
regard suggested the use of Rp- cAMPS substituted at the 8-carbon of the purine ring by a heteroatom (e.g. Br or Cl) or a heteroatom-attached group (e.g. piperidine). Moreover Gjertsen et al in J. Biol. Chem. 270:20599-20607 (1995) demonstrated that 8-chloro and 8-bromo Rp-cAMPS had a higher antagonistic activity relative to PKAI than 8-unsubstituted Rp-cAMPS.<br>
Various 8-substituted cAMPS are available conunercially from Biolog-Life Science Institute of Bremen, Germany, in particular Rp-8-Br-cAMPS, Rp-8-Br-MB-cAMPS (MB is a monobutyryl substituent at the 2' position of the ribose ring), Rp-8-Cl-cAMPS, Rp-8-CPT-cAMPS (where CPT = 4-chlorophenylthio) , Rp-8-HA-cAMPS (where HA = hexylamino), Rp-8-OH-cAMPS, Rp-8-PIP-cAMPS (where PIP = piperidirio), Rp-8-AEA-cAMPS (where AEA = 2-aminoethylamino), Rp-8-AHA-cAMPS (where AHA = 6-aminohexylamino), Rp-8-N3-cAMPS (where N3 = azido), and Rp-8-I-cAMPS.  Biolog also supply Sp-cAMPS compounds but again all are either 8-unsubstituted or are 8-substituted by a heteroatom or a heteroatom-attached group.<br>
The present treatment of HIV infection is a potent cocktail of anti-HIV drugs/ highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART).  HAART includes protease inhibitors and nucleoside and nonnucleoside analogs that target the virus and is the main component in the treatment of HIV-infected patients.  However, although HAART significantly prolongs life of HIV infected patients by stopping the development of AIDS, impaired T cell function seems to persist.  In fact, the HIV-specific immune response has been seen to decline rather than increase during HAART.  Furthermore, HAART does not eradicate the virus, patients display virological relapse upon withdrawal of treatment and in some patients the virus develops resistance to the treatment. in addition, a large number of patients develop<br><br>
intolerance to the present drugs with potentially serious adverse events.<br>
Thus, there is an increasingly recognized need for other treatment modalities.  Treatment based on imitiunomodulation that can improve the function of the somewhat "knocked down" immune system of HIV-patients might make the immune system competent in driving out the virus from its reservoirs and could be an important adjuvant therapy in HIV-patients.  Elevated levels of cAMP and thus increased activation of PKA type I significantly inhibit proliferation of T cells from HIV-infected individuals independent of ongoing HAART.  Use of a selective antagonist of PKA type I improves the impaired proliferation of T cells from HIV-infected patients up to 300%.  The observations described above suggest PKA type I as a potential target for immunomodulating therapy. PKA type I selective antagonists such as Rp-8-Br-cAMPS offer one possibility to reverse the inappropriate activation of PKA type I in immunodeficiencies and thereby restore T cell function and immune responsiveness. It has been shown that most Rp-cAMPS isomers act as antagonists of PKA by competitively binding to the cAMP binding sites of the R subunit, but do not dissociate and activate the enzyme.<br>
Furthermore, characterization of derivatives of Rp-cAMPS has shown that some compounds (e. g. Rp-8-Br-cAMPS) act as selective and full antagonists of the PKA. type I isoenzyme and as partial agonists of the PKA type II isoenzyme. Most cells and tissues contain highly significant amounts of PKA type II anchored at a number of subceliular sites and implicated in mediating a large number of cAMP induced effects.<br>
In contrast, although PKA type I is also widely<br><br>
distributed, it has mainly been shown to be necessary and sufficient for regulation of function of immune cells.  This offers some tissue/cell selectivity, which could favor a potential treatment based on a PKA type I selective antagonist.  Despite PKA type I being an interesting drug target, no pharmaceutically acceptable cAMP antagonist is available.  Development of iiranunostimulatory drugs that interfere with cAMP action will improve the immune function of T lymphocytes and can be brought to pre-clinical testing by developing PKA type I selective cAMP antagonists that counteract cAMP action.  The specific aims of the performed research were the development of such compounds and development of methods and models for evaluation of compounds as immunostimulatory drugs that reverse the immunodeficiency in HIV.<br>
We have now surprisingly found that particularly high PKAI (or more precisely PKA RIa) affinity, i.e. cAMP agonism and more especially antagonism, may be achieved using cAMPS in which the purine 8-carbon is substituted by a carbyl group, i.e. a carbon-attached group.<br>
Thus viewed from one aspect the invention provides 8-carbyl substituted cAMPS or a derivative thereof.<br>
By the term derivative in this context is meant a compound which is chemically modified but retains the ability to exert the activity of the 8-substituted cAMPS in use, e.g. a salt, ester, prodrug (i.e. bioprecursor), etc. form.  Where the derivative contains or generates in use a component separate from the 8-substituted cAMPS, e.g. a counterion or a cleavable protective group, this component is preferably physiologically tolerable.<br>
The 8-substituent, which as stated is required to be attached to the 8-position on the adenine ring by a<br><br>
carbon-carbon bond, may typically contain up to 25 non-hydrogen atoms, more preferably up to 20, especially up to 15, particularly up to 10.  These non-hydrogen atoms include at least one carbon and may all be carbon; however preferably at least one, e.g. up to 6, of the non-hydrogen atoms may be heteroatoms, e.g. halogen, oxygen, sulphur, nitrogen or phosphorus, especially 0, N or S.  The 8-substituent may be linear, branched or cyclic or a combination of two or more thereof and may be saturated or unsaturated.  Especially preferably the substituent is or contains a cyclic group, in particular a homo or heterocyclic aryl group, e.g. containing 5 to 10 ring atoms, most particularly a heteroaryl group containing 5 ring atoms or a phenyl group.  Thus for example the substituent may be an aryl, aralkyl, alkaryl, alkyl, cyclic alkyl, alkenyl, or alkynyl group optionally attached via a carbonyl or thiocarbonyl group and optionally substituted by acyl, halo, hydroxy, thiol, amino, carboxy (or other oxyacid), cyano, azido, alkoxy, ester, ether or alkylthio groups.  In any such substituents, alkyl groups or unsaturated analogs thereof preferably contain up to 10 carbons, particularly up to 6 carbons.<br>
Examples of typical 8-substituents according to the invention include aryl groups such as benzene, naphthalene and annulated carboxylic systems, and armulated heterocyclic systems including pyridine, di-and tnazines, furan, thiophene and pyrrole, and the azoles, and triazoles, and oxa- and thiadiazoles, and tetrazoles;  heteroaryl groups such as the six-membered ring azines, pyridine, the diazines, triazines and annulated carbocyclic systems, and annulated heterocyclic systems as defined above, and five-membered ring systems such as furan, thiophene and pyrrole, the azoles, and triazoles, and oxa- and thiadiazoles, and tetrazoles and annulated heterocyclic and carbocyclic systems as defined above;  optionally substituted aryl<br><br>
and heteroaryl groups, e.g. substituted by<br>
(i) OR1 where R1 =• H, d-C10 alkyl, C2-Ci0 alkenyl, C2-C10 alkynyl, aryl or heteroaryl groups, and optionally substituted derivatives thereof,<br>
(ii) SR1, SOR1 and SC^R1, where R1 is as defined above,<br>
(iii) NR^1 where each R1 which may be the same or different is as defined above,<br>
(iv) halogen,<br>
(v) COyR1, COR1, or CONRV where each R1 which may be the same or different is as defined above, and<br>
(vi) additional optionally substituted aryl and heteroaryl groups;<br>
carbonyl, thiocarbonyl, iminocarbonyl and cyano derivatives such as  C02Ra, COR1, CONRV, C(NR:)NR1R1, CSNR^1 and CN where each R1 which may be the same or different is as defined above;  and non-aromatic carbon substituents which are optionally substituted, such as<br>
Ci-Cio alkyl,<br>
C2-Ci0 alkenyl,<br>
C2-Cio alkynyl, e.g. where the optional substitution involves<br>
(a)	insertion of additional double and triple bonds<br>
into C2-Ci0 alkenyl or alkynyl groups<br>
(b)	insertion of oxo groups to form ketones or<br>
aldehydes<br>
(c)	substitution by aryl and heteroaryl<br>
substituents themselves optionally substituted by<br>
halogen (e.g. F and/or Cl) , OR1, SR1, S-oxides (e.g. SOR1<br>
and SOzR1), NRV, COi-R1, or CONR'R1 where each R1 which<br>
may be the same or different is as defined above.<br>
Particularly preferred  8-substituents include phenyl,<br><br>
furyl, and thienyl groups, especially 2-furyl groups.<br>
Where the 8-substituent is an aryl group it may if desired be substituted by one or more polar groups, e.g. OR1, SR1, SOR1, SO^R1, NR]2, halogen, COzR1, COR1, CONRV, N02, P(OR1.i2, and CH20R1.<br>
In the 8-carbyl-substituted cAMPS of the invention, other skeletal positions may if desired also be substituted, e.g. the 2'-oxygen, the nitrogen of the 6-amino group and the oxygen and sulphurs pendant from the cyclic phosphorus atom.  In this regard the substituents may be substituents as defined above for the 8-position or for example substituents known in conjunction with cAMP and cAMPS (e.g. acyl, alkylcarbonyl, aryl, etc.) Silyl substitution of the 2'-oxygen is especially preferred in compounds according to the invention which are 2'-protected versions of active compounds.<br>
With the exception of substitutions to produce a prodrug, the compounds according to the invention are desirably used in a form where only the 8 position is substituted.  Prodrug forms in which the phosphorus-pendant oxygen or sulphur is substituted so as to mask the acidity of the cyclic phosphorus group however are particularly preferred.  Such prodrugs may thus for example typically be S-alkylated.  While S-alkylation is a preferred option, the group introduced may typically be an ester, or thioester (i.e. R-CS-S-R-, R-CO-S-R- or R-CS-0-R-) group attached directly or indirectly to a methylene group attached to the sulphur of the phosphorothioic acid.  In the case of indirect attachment, the linker preferably contains a delocalized electron structure such that (thio)ester cleavage triggers deprotection (e.g. using P-acyl-benzyl protecting group as in Scheme 2b below). Alternatively, prodrug forms may be used in which the amino group in the 6-position of the adenine ring or the hydroxyl group<br><br>
on the furyl ring is protected by a group eliminatable following administration, e.g. an ester or double ester protective group. Similarly, the 6-amino group can be N-protected by an acyloxyalkyl group such as pivalyloxymethyl or by an alkyloxymethyl group. In general, in the production of such prodrugs, the amine or hydroxyl protection can be effected either before or after the thiation depending on the nature of the O- and N-protective groups.<br>
Compounds substituted at the phosphorus-pendant oxygen or sulphur may be especially useful where the preparation process requires separation of the Rp and S.p isomers, e.g. by chroraatography or crystallization. Compounds in which the 2'-position is silylated may likewise be particularly preferred as intermediates to facilitate purification.<br>
The 8-carbyl substituted cAMPS of the invention may be in the Rp or the Sp configuration or may contain both Rp and Sp isomers.  For use according to the invention, the compound is preferably at least 90% Rp (or Sp), especially at least 95%, particularly at least 98%.  For use as a cAMP antagonist, the compound is preferably majoratively in the form of the Rp isomer;  for use as a cAMP agonist it is preferably majoratively in the form of the Sp isomer.<br>
Described in particular detail below are four process schemes by which the 8-carbyl substituted compounds of the invention may be made.  In the first, an 8-halogenated 3'5'-cyclic phosphoramidate is 8-carbylated whereafter the phosphorus attached nitrogen is replaced by a sulphur in a reaction which retains the configuration of the chiral phosphorus;  in the second and third an adenosine is 8-carbylated whereafter the cyclic phosphorus group is introduced;  and in the fourth an 8-halo-cAMPS is 8-carbylated.  The first and<br><br>
second process schemes are preferred for reasons of flexibility (and retention of stereochemistry) in the case of the first and of economy in the case of the second.  All these process schemes form a further aspect of the invention.  Viewed from this aspect the invention provides a process for the preparation of an 8-carbylated cAMPS or derivative thereof, said process comprising at least one of the following steps:<br>
a)	reacting a 2'-protected 8-carbylated -adenosine<br>
3',5'-cyclic phosphoramidate with carbon disulphide and deprotectang the 2'-hydroxyl;<br>
b)	reacting an 8-carbylated-adenosine with SPC13 in a<br>
dry solvent;<br>
c)	reacting an 8-carbylated-adenosine with a phosphite<br>
and subsequently with sulphur;<br>
d)	reacting an optionally 2'-protected-8-halo-cAMPS<br>
with an alkylating agent and if required deprotecting<br>
the 2'-hydroxyl;<br>
e)	transforming an 8-carbylated cAMPS into a salt<br>
thereof;<br>
f)	reacting an 8-carbylated cAMPS with a biologically<br>
cleavable protecting group;  and<br>
g)	separating Rp and Sp isomers of an RP/SP isomer<br>
mixture of an 8-carbylated cAMPS or derivative thereof.<br>
Carbylation in the purine 8-position can be effected particularly readily using a material functionalized in the 8-position. A convenient functionalisation in the 8-position in the purine heterocycle can be achieved by introduction of a bromine atom by a simple bromination.<br>
The 8-carbyl substituent in the compounds of the invention may be an electron donor or electron<br><br>
withdrawing group as desired.<br>
Adenosine is brominated regioselectively in the 8-position by addition of bromine to a NaOAc buffered aqueous solution at ambient temperature. cAMP can be brominated in a similar manner, but is also commercially available. Alternatively, halogenation in the 8-position can be effected by way of the corresponding lithiated species and addition of halogen, in particular the method has been used for bromination and iodination of adenosine. The substrate in this case was fully silyl-protected (TBDMS) adenosine. Lithiation in the 8-position was effected with nBuLi under standard conditions. This approach may offer the best access to 8-iodo derivatives.<br>
Carbylation reactions:<br>
(i)  At both the nucleoside level or the cyclic<br>
nucleotide level, carbylation can be effected by transition metal catalysed cross-coupling reactions. We have developed methodology useful for the preparation of a series of palladium-catalysed reactions.<br>
(ii) At the intermediate cyclic phosphoramidate<br>
level, carbylation in the purine 8-position can be effected by transition metal catalysed cross-coupling reactions.<br>
(iii)Carbylation can also be effected at the cyclic phosphorothioic acid level. Preferentially the phosphorothioic acid exists in the form of an 0-ester or an S-ester. The ester can subsequently be cleaved to the corresponding phosphorothioic acid derivative.<br>
In cross-coupling reactions, simple alkylation has been effected under Pd-catalytic conditions in reactions<br><br>
between peracetylated 8-Br-adenosine and tetraalkyl stannaries.  A more convenient method for the synthesis of lower alkyl purine nucleosides is available by palladium-catalysed cross-coupling reaction of halogenopurine nucleosides with trialkylaluminums. Both vinylation and allylation have been effected from the appropriate stannanes using Pd-catalysis. The alkyne function has been introduced via an 8-bromo derivative which was coupled with terminal alkynes using Pd-catalysis in the presence of Cu(I) iodide under the Sonogashira conditions.<br>
The reaction schemes shown below are illustrative -other reagents and end products may be used or made<br>
analogous]y.<br>
Process I<br>
Amidate intermediates for thiylation:<br>
Preparation of (RP) -8-substituted adenosinephosphorothioic acids<br>
General methodology<br>
(Figure Remove) <br><br><br>
In this method for the synthesis of the phosphorothioates C in Scheme 1, cAMP amidates<br>
intermediates are essential substrates. cAMP is<br><br>
brominated as described for adenosine, or the bromo compound is obtained commercially. The literature describes a method for the preparation of a diastereomer mixture of 3',5'-cyclic phosphoramidates (see Stec, Ace. Chem. Res. 16:411-417 (1983) and Beres et al. J. Org.<br>
Chem. 5jO:1271-1278 (1985)).  The initial step involves an Apple-type reaction with PhjP/CCl, to provide the corresponding phosphoryl chlorides. Apparently there is little stereochemical control during chlorination at the phosphorus atom. Hence a diastereoisomer mixture of anilides results after amidation of the chlorides, (cf. Scheme 2). The amidates are neutral molecules which are soluble in a number of organic solvents and can be separated into the pure diastereoisomers by chromatographic procedures, or by fractional crystallisations.<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
our new and inventive	procedure in Scheme 2, cAMP-8-<br>
Br as an ammonium salt 1	is 2'-0-protected by a bulky<br>
silyl group. TBDMS-C1 is	a convenient and efficient<br>
reagent for this purpose	(TBDMS = tert-butyl dimethyl<br>
silyl).  The silyl ether	2 is subsequently chlorinated<br>
to form structure 3.<br>
The bulky silyl group also has a second important function in the synthetic sequence. It allows the product after thiation to be precipitated efficiently from an aqueous reaction mixture and is helpful in the purification as described below.  Other protecting groups with similar properties might also be used.<br>
In the chlorination method, oxalyl chloride has been used successfully together with catalytic amounts of, or even an excess of DMF. The actual chlorinating agent of phosphorus is an intermediate chloro-imino derivative which is generated in situ from oxalyl chloride and DMF.<br>
The desired phosphoryl chloride stereomer 3 can be<br>
isolated.  The crude product, however, may be used in the subsequent amidation step.<br>
Various primary amines, or masked amines, can be used for the amination. Nucleophilic amines react readily with the chloride. The amidates, however, must be sufficiently strong acids for an abstraction of the remaining hydrogen of the amino group. Several aromatic amines would satisfy the latter requirement. We have chosen aniline for our work. The reaction with aniline can be effected in dichloromethane in the cold. Under these conditions the reaction is stereospecific in that only one amidate stereoisomer 4 is obtained from the<br>
reaction mixture.<br>
The amidates are neutral molecules which are readily dissolved in several common organic solvents. Hence these molecules are appropriate for carbylation reactions in the 8-position. Several transition metals will catalyse this process. We have used extensively palladium in the catalyst systems. In most cases Stille conditions with stannyl reagents have been used in our preliminary work. The yields of cross-coupled products are excellent. Other organometallic reagents can be used, e.g. zinc and boron compounds. Coupling of a boronic acid under Suzuki conditions proceeds in the same manner as shown in Scheme 3. Hence a number of 8-substituted derivatives will become available by this methodology.<br>
(Figure Remove)8-bromo derivative 4 and the 8-carbylated amidates 5 and 11 in Schemes 2, 2a and 3 are subsequently thiated. Thiylation by means of carbon disuldide for displacement of the amine has been recommended.  We find that with carbon disulfide in THF and potassium tert-butoxide as<br><br>
base, the thiation at room temperature requires less than 3 hours. The phoshorothioates 6 are obtained in<br>
excellent yields. The substitution proceeds stereoselectively with retention of the configuration at the phosphorus atom. However, the formal configurational assignments are changed because of the nomenclature priority rules.  This work leads to the Rp configuration in the phosphorothioic acid target molecules .<br>
Besides protection, the presence of a bulky silyl group is very important for the isolation of the thiated product 6 because of its relative solubilities in the<br>
isolation and purification process.<br>
Desilylation of the product 6 is effected by ammonium<br>
fluoride in DMF solution. The desilylation is run at room temperature over 5 days after which the target products 7 are isolated in excellent yield. In this way<br>
both 8-carbylated target products, as well as the 8-bromo CAMPS, are obtained. When desirable, the 8-bromo CAMPS can be a substrate for cross-coupling reactions after 0- or S-protection in the acid function as<br>
referred to in Process IV.<br>
The formation of the amidates (4 in Scheme 2) in a<br>
stereoselective manner is an important step in the synthesis outlined in this section.  The aniline amidate hydrogen is sufficiently acidic to allow ready abstraction (e.g. with an alkoxide base) for the subsequent thiation.  A very efficient and stereoselective thiation however can also be achieved where an aliphatic or substituted aliphatic amine (e.g. benzylamine) is used in place of aniline for amidate formation. In this case a strong base (e.g. butyl lithium) is used for deprotonation (see for example Scheme 2A).<br><br>
Where aliphatic or substituted amines (such as benzylamine) are used, moreover, 8-carbylation may advantageously be effected using organozinc compounds, especially the ones where the organo group is a small heterocycle, in particular one attached at a ring carbon adjacent a ring heteroatom, e.g. in conjunction with a palladium catalyst.  In general, where a cyclic group is to be linked to the 8-position, it is preferred that the atoms adjacent to the ring carbon attachment site are unsubstituted.<br>
Process II<br>
Thiation by ring-closing reactions:<br>
(Rp)-cAMPS has been synthesized enzymatically from the<br>
corresponding nucleoside 5'-0- (1-thiotriphosphate) .<br>
Enzymatic techniques are not used in the Examples below but would provide an alternative procedure.<br>
In a chemical synthesis N-benzoyl-adenosine without O-<br>
protection was treated with bis(p-<br>
nitrophenyl)phosphorochlorothioate in pyridine.  The<br>
product, adenosine 5'-bis(p-<br>
nitrophenyl)phosphorothioate, was subsequently cyclised<br>
in dry DMF with potassium tert-butoxide as base. After<br>
deblocking with cone, aqueous ammonia, the diastereomers<br>
were separated by chromatography. (Figure Remove)<br>
Synthesis of nucleoside-3',5'-cyclic phosphorothioate by cyclothiophosphorylation of unprotected nucleosides has been effected with thiosphosphoryl trichloride (Scheme 4). The initial phosphorylation presumably takes place at the 5'-OH group in the sugar. Trialkyl phosphates are recommended as solvents. The products have been cyclised directly at high dilution by alkali hydroxide in aqueous acetonitrile to give the diastereoisomeric nucleosides-3',5'-eyelie phosphorothioates cAMP in a 1:1 ratio which have to be separated by chromatographic techniques. The<br>
diastereoisomers of the parent compound 10 in Scheme 4 carry no substituent in the 8-postion.<br>
In the present invention the adenosines 8 have been converted into (Rp)-8-substituted-adenosine-3',5'-cyclic phosphorothioates 7 as outlined in Scheme 6. We have<br>
developed a method which delivers almost exclusively the desired 3',5'-cyclic phosphorothioates 7, but as a<br>
stereochemical mixture. The reaction is clean in this respect when thiophosphorylation and cyclisation are effected in dry pyridine in the cold. Either stereoisomer can be isolated in a pure state after a chromatographic separation. The 8-phenyl derivative 7e<br>
was prepared by this methodology shown in Scheme 5.<br>
When desirable, (Sp)-cAMPS derivatives would be available in a similar manner.<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
The finding that the pyridine and similar solvents must be especially dried represents an invention since the cyclisation reaction under these conditions is much improved both in selectivity and yield.<br>
(Figure Remove)For Process II and Process III work, we have prepared a<br>
great number of 8-carbylated nucleosides. The nucleoside intermediates were cyclised in a routine fashion using thiophosphoryl chloride. The carbylation reactions of adenosines are summarized in Scheme 6.<br>
For the carbylation of nucleosides in Scheme 7, the 8-bromo derivative 11 of adenosine was used. Protection of<br>
the sugar hydroxyl groups was either by acetylation to provide the triacetylated substrate 12 or by silylation<br>
to provide the trisilylated substrate 13 Several Pd-<br>
catalyst systems were used for the cross-coupling reaction. The reaction conditions had to be varied. Some of our better conditions are given in Scheme 7 for the preparation of the compounds 14 - 16. Stille conditions<br>
were used for the preparation of cross-coupled products 14, whereas methylation (15a) was effected from<br>
trimethylaluminum under Negishi conditions. The same conditions were also used to prepare the 2-furyl derivative 15b in the same yield as obtained under the Stille conditions which provided the same compound numbered 14b.<br>
(Figure Remove)Reactions from boronic acids under the Suzuki conditions also proceeded well to furnish compounds 16 in high<br>
yields. The phenyl compound 16a was obtained in approximately the same yield as 14a under the Stille<br>
conditions. The 8-substituted adenosines were subsequently prepared under hydrolytic conditions from<br>
the esters 14, and by tetrabutylammonium fluoride desilylation from the silyl ethers 15 and 16. All reactions proceeded satisfactorily.<br>
(Figure Remove) <br>
Scheme 8 shows the preparation of adenosins carrying an oxo group and a hydroxyl group at the a-carbon in the 8-substituent. The starting material was the cross-coupled 8-(a-ethoxyethenyl)adenosine 17k. Mild acid conditions<br>
cleaved the vinyl ether function with formation of the acetyl derivative 171 in high yield. A subsequent sodium<br>
borohydride reduction gave the corresponding hydroxyl derivative 17m. No stereoselectivity was observed at the<br>
epimeric alcohol carbon. No attempts were made to separate the stereoisomers present in equal amounts.<br>
Process III<br>
Phosphite P(III) approach:<br>
The 8-carbylated nucleosides 17 and their derivatives in Schemes 7 and 8 are appropriate substrates for Process III as well as for Process II (vide supra). So far, we have demonstrated the principle for Process III by the preparation of the parent phosphorothioic acids 19. 8-Carbylated analogs are indicated by the 8-R substituent in substrate 9 displayed in Scheme 9.<br>
(Figure Remove) <br>
Adenosine will react with trivalent phosphorus reagents to form cyclic phosphites. To ensure regioselective 3',5'-cyclophosphitylation, an initial attack from a bifunctional phosphorus(III) reagent on the primary 5'-hydroxy group is required. Therefore the best reagents would have a considerable steric bulkiness. According to the literature, 2'O-methyladenosine can be converted<br>
into 2'O-methyl-cis-adenosine-3' , 5'-cyclic methyl monophosphite in reactions with bis(W,N-diisopropylamino)methoxyphosphine. The reaction is promoted by iH-tetrazole. Both the cis- and trans-<br>
cyclophosphite esters are formed. At elevated<br><br>
temperature the tz~ans-diastereomer is inverted to the cis-isomer.<br>
Each isomer separately, or as a mixture, can subsequently be thiated with sulfur. The oxidative addition of sulfur occurs at the site of the lone pairs of electrons on the phosphorus atom with retention of the relative configuration at the phosphorus atom. The oxidative thiation is run on a stereoisomer mixture or on a pure stereoisomer. In the former approach, an additional separation of the phosphorothioic acid stereomers is required.<br>
We have found that phosphitylation can equally well be performed on the unprotected adenosine. The product first formed was a mixture of cis- (31P NMR 8 123 and<br>
trans-(31P NMR 8 129) phosphites. The mixture was equilibrated to the cis-isomer without loss of material. Additional IH-tetrazole was found to accelerate the<br>
isomer transformation. Each isomer separately, or as a mixture, was subsequently thiated with sulfur. The oxidative addition of sulfur occurs at the site of the lone pairs of electrons on the phosphorus atom with retention of the relative configuration at the phosphorus atom. In the example described herein, the oxidative thiation was carried out on a mixture of the phosphate diastereoisomers. In this case the phosphorothioic acid diastereomers are separated by chromatography.<br>
Process IV Carbylations<br>
Carbylations by cross-coupling reactions can be carried out at the final phosphorothioic acid level as indicated in Scheme 10.  The substrate carries a leaving group in the purine 8-position. A reaction sequence is<br><br>
illustrated for the 2'-OTBDMS-8-bromo derivative 20<br>
which is available by reactions shown in previous schemes, either as a pure stereoisomer or as a diastereoisomer mixture, which needs to be separated into pure stereoisomers after the carbylation reaction has been effected.<br>
Either the S- or the O-atom of the thiophosphoric acid is protected to provide the S-ester 21 or the corresponding O-ester. As shown in Scheme 11, the S-ester 21 is cross-coupled either under Stille or Suzuki<br>
conditions, or subjected to alternative modifications used in cross-coupling reactions, to provide the 8-carbylated product 22. The latter can be deprotected to<br>
the thioic acid 6, and further to the target compound 7. Coupling reactions can in a similar way be effected on substrates with a free 2'-OH group, the sequence 23 -^ 25, and further on to the target compound 7.<br>
(Figure Remove)mentioned above, it may be desirable to use the compounds of the invention in prodrug form.  Typical such prodrugs may be produced by S-alkylation and two reaction schemes for S-alkylation are set out as Schemes 11 and 12 below.  Schemes 11 and 12 describe reaction of the phosphorothioate with an alkyl halide, or more specifically a haloalkyl carboxylate. (Figure Remove)<br>
The hydrophilic 8-substituted cAMPS compounds of the invention are preferably purified by transformation into their soluble trialkylammonium (e.g. tributylammonium) salts followed by flash chromatography, e.g. on silica gel.  Such a1kylammonium salts may be prepared by mixing the ammonium salts with an alkylamine and evaporating off ammonia.  The resultant product may then if desired be transformed into alternative salt form, e.g. sodium salt form, prior to use.<br>
The conditions and reagents used in these processes are only examplary. Other reagents, solvents and reaction conditions can also be used, especially when these processes are used industrially to produce<br>
Pharmaceuticals. A skilled chemist with a background in development chemistry will routinely improve these processes by selection of conditions, reagents and solvents with focus on: cost, safety, hazard, toxicity, environment and regulatory aspects.<br>
Thus viewed from a further aspect the invention provides an 8-carbylated adenosine cyclic 3',5'-phosphoramidate or a derivative thereof.<br>
Viewed from a still further aspect the invention provides an 8-carbylated-2'-protected (e.g. silylated) adenosine cyclic 3',5'-phosphorothioate or a derivative thereof.<br>
Viewed from another aspect the invention provides an 8-halo (and preferably 2'-protected (e.g. silylated)) adenosine cyclic 3',5'-phosphoramidate or a derivative<br>
thereof.<br>
Viewed from a still further aspect the invention provides an 8-carbylated adenosine cyclic 3',5'-monophosphite or a derivative thereof.<br>
Viewed from a further aspect the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising an 8-carbylated cAMPS or a derivative thereof together with a physiologically tolerable carrier or recipient.<br>
The composition of the invention may take any convenient administration form, e.g. tablet, capsule, powder, syrup, spray, solution, dispersion, suppository, etc. The active agent will be admixed with a suitable carrier or excipient, e.g. a solvent (such as water for injections), diluents, stabilizers, viscosity modifiers, pH modifiers, aromas, flavours, antioxidants, etc. and the composition may be prepared in conventional fashion.<br>
Viewed from a still further aspect the invention<br>
provides ci method of treatment of the human or non-human animal (preferably mammalian) body to achieve a cAMP agonist 01 antagonist effect therein, said method comprising administering to said body an effective amount of an 8-carbylated cAMPS or derivative thereof according to the invention.<br>
The method of treatment is especially preferably for treatment of neoplastic diseases, immunodeficiencies and viral infections, especially HIV infection.<br>
Viewed from a further aspect the invention provides the use of an 8-carbylated cAMPS or derivative thereof according to the invention for the manufacture of a medicament for use in a method of treatment of the human or non-human animal (preferably mammalian) body to achieve a cAMP agonist or antagonist effect therein.<br>
The dosage of the 8-carbylated cAMPS or derivative will depend on the nature of the condition being treated as well as the size, sex and species of the recipient.  In general daily dosages for human subjects in particular will be of the order of 0.01 to 100 mg/kg bodyweight. Administration is preferably orally or iv.<br>
Because of their cAMP agonist/antagonist properties, the 8-carbylated cAMPS and derivatives of the invention may be used in competitive binding assays for cAMP, e.g. in biological samples.  One such assay is desribed in WO 2004/027074.  In such assays the 8-carbylated cAMPS is preferably labelled (e.g. radiolabelled or chromophore labelled! and may conveniently be substrate-bound.<br>
Thus viewed from a further aspect the invention provides an assay method for determining cAMP in a sample, generally a biological sample, which method involves contacting said sample with a cAMP-analog and a cAMP binding reagent, characterized in that said analog is an 8-carbylated cAMPS or derivative thereof.<br><br>
The? invention is applicable to other purine nucleotides than adenosine, in particular guanosine, and adenosine and guanosine analogs including their di- and tri-aza analogs, e.g. the annular di- and tri-aza analogs (for example annulated imidazo-pyridines, benzimidazole and annulated pyrrolo-pyrimidines and pyrrolo-pyridines) such as 1-deazapurine, 3-deazapurine, 7-deazapurine and 1,3-deazapurine, and in further aspects of the invention the definitions and experimental teaching contained herein may be applied mutatis mutandi to such other purine nucleotides which may of course be substituted at other skeletal positions analogously to the 8-carbylated cAMPS described above.  Such 8-carbylated non-adenosine purine cyclic 3',5' phosphorothioates may be used therapeutically in applications applicable to the particular nucleotide, e.g. for treatment of virus infections, immune deficiencies and neoplastic diseases.<br>
One aspect of the present invention is the use of a combination of the present cAMP antagonists/agonists with other drugs that have an effect on the immune system.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention relates to a combination of the present cAMP antagonists/agonists with other drugs useful for treatment of HIV infections and neoplastic diseases.<br>
A key reagent in the preparation of many of the compounds according to the invention is 8-Br-cAMP.  Up until now, reports in the literature only refer to small scale preparations (e.g. 
 <br>
concentrated solutions of cAMP with a concentrated buffer to scavenge the HBr that is produced during the reaction of cAMP with bromine.  By using concentrated cAMP solutions, a two-fold benefit is also achieved -the proportion of the 8-Br-cAMP product that is precipitated out as if forms is optimised (thus making product collection easier) and the cAMP(H) starting material contributes to the buffer system.  Thus for example 0.2M cAMP(H) and 0.4M sodium acetate creates a buffer system equivalent to 0.2M NaOAc/AcOH with a pH which remains stable during the bromination at about 4.7.<br>
Such a process forms a further aspect of the invention. Viewed from this aspect the invention provides a process for the preparation of 8-Br-cAMP which comprises reacting cAMP with bromine in a buffered solution (preferably aqueous), reacting with a reducing agent (e.g. sodium sulphite) to remove excess bromine, collecting the 8-Br-cAMP produced, and optionally removing free bromine from the collected 8-Br-cAMP, wherein cAMP is used in concentrated solution form (e.g. 0.15 to 0.6M, preferably 0.16 to 0.3M, especially 0.17 to 0.25M) and the buffer (e.g. an acetate buffer) is sufficiently concentrated to maintain a solution pH which is in the range 3.5 to 5.5, especially 4 to 5.  In this process, the bromine is preferably added slowly and the reducing agent is also subsequently added slowly. This process is exemplified in Example 47 below.<br>
The invention will now be described further with reference to the following non-limiting Examples.<br>

-8~Phenyladenosine-3' , 5' -cyclic phosphorothioic acid<br>
8-Phenyladenosine (I7e) (0.343 g, 1 mmol) was dried by repeated azeotropic distillation with pyridine and then dissolved in pyridine (10 ml) which had been freshly distilled from calcium hydride under argon gas on a continuous still. Thiophosphoryl chloride (0.169 g, 1 mmol) in dry THF (2 ml) was added to the above pyridine solution under an argon atmosphere at -12 °C over 10 min. The mixture was stirred at -12 °C for 15 min before the reaction mixture was added to a vigorously stirred solution of sodium hydroxide (0.240 g, 6 mmol) in water (40 ml) at 60 °C and thereafter rapidly poured onto crushed dry ice. When the evolution of carbon dioxide had ceased, the solvents were distilled off at reduced pressure. The bath temperature during the distillation was not allowed to exceed 35°C. The solid residue was washed repeatedly with diethyl ether, extracted into methanol (5 ml), the mixture filtered and the filtrate<br>
added slowly with vigorous stirring to THF (100 ml). Filtration through celite and evaporation of the filtrate at reduced pressure left a solid material. The product was a 1:1 mixture of the (RP)- and the (SP)- 8-phenyladenosine-3' , 5' -cyclic phosphorothioic diastereoisomers. The isomers were separated chromatoqraphically when the mixture was subjected to preparative reversed phase chromatography on a C18-functionalised silica gel column using as eluent water:methanol:formic acid 80:20:0.5.

Determination of IC50 values of new Rp-cAMPS analogs in PKA<br>
type la enzyme activation assay in vitro (Cook kinase<br>
assay)<br>
The purpose of the following analysis was the classification of new Rp-cAMPS analogs as antagonists or agonists of Type I (RIa/Ca) holoenzyme complex of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase and the determination of the ECbo values using a suppression or an activation assay based on the spectrophotometric assay by Cook.<br>
Rp-cAMPS analog screening for antagonists and agonists:<br>
First, new Rp-cAMPS analogs were screened in an activation assay using 10 nM RIa holoenzyme and 10 uM of each Rp-cAMPS analog to test for activation. To characterize in detail the antagonistic properties of the Rp-cAMPS analogs a suppression assay was used. 10 nM RIa holoenzyme was partially (80%) activated by addition of 1 uM Sp-8-Br-cAMPS (in assay mix for three minutes). Then holoenzyme was reconstituted by addition of Rp-cAMPS antagonist (increasing concentrations, five minutes incubation time before starting the assay with kemptide). Antagonists then block binding and activation of PKA by Sp-8-Br-cAMPS by competitive antagonism and result in a decrease in kinase activity.<br>
EC50 determination for Rp-cAMPS analogs vs. PKA type la:<br>
EC50 values for antagonists were determined using the suppression assay based on the spectrophotometric assay by Cook and different concentrations of Rp-cAMPS analogs ranging from pM to mM. At least 10 measurements in duplicates were performed per analog using partly<br><br>
activated RIa holoenzyme (10 nM) in 1 uM Sp-8-Br cAMPS (80?, activation of the complex). Preincubatioris of five minutes were given before adding kemptide to allow reconstitution of the holoenzyme complex for compounds with antagonistic properties. The new compounds were compared to Rp-8-Br-cAMPS in the testing.<br>
The activation constant of RIa holoenzyme with cAMP was determined. After a 3 minute preincubation of increasing concentrations of cAMP with 10 nM RIa holoenzyme in assay mix the reaction was started by addition of 200 uM kemptide, OD340 was monitored for 1 minute and the slope (AOD3io/min) was plotted as a direct correlation for the relative activity of activated catalytic subunit. EC50 was 88nM.<br>

This assay allows measuring of antagonist binding independently from kinase activity in order to determine EC&amp;o values for cAMP analogs specifically binding to distinct cAMP-binding domains within the holo enzyme complex. Thus both assays either based on activity or binding yield complementing information about the mechanism how antagonist binding prevents the activation of the holo enzyme complex.<br>
For these studies it was necessary to capture not only the regulatory subunit onto agonist sensor surfaces (i.e. 8-AHA cAMP), but to immobilise the whole holo enzyme complex site-directed via antagonist ligands (i.e. Rp-8AHA cAMPS). This facilitates the determination of ECso values for antagonists binding either to the holo enzyme complex or single sites of the regulatory subunits. The holo enzyme complex will be incubated with different amounts of antagonist prior to injection to the chip surface. Binding of antagonist results in a reduced binding signal on the chip surface (surface competition) yielding EC5o values for the antagonists. However, if the holo complex dissociates upon binding to the ligand surface because of partial agonistic properties of the ligand, the resulting binding signal will be lower than expected and the dissociation may alter the observed EC5o value for the antagonist. Thus various experiments had to be performed to validate whether holo RIa or only RIa is bound during association to the Rp-8-AHA cAMPS or the 8-AHA cAMP surface.<br><br>
For that reason the holo RIa was tested for binding on the two different surfaces, the 8-AHA cAMP and the Rp 8AHA-cAMPS surface, using two different conditions. In the presence of ATP and Mg the regulatory and catalytic subunits bind tightly and form the holo enzyme complex, whereas in the presence of EDTA which chelates the Mg ions the affinity is significantly lower and dissociation of the complex is facilitated. During association of a 10 nM RIa holoenzyme solution a response signal of 900 RU was achieved on the Rp-8-AHA cAMPS surface. Less than half of this signal was reached on the 8-AHA cAMP surface, indicating that only the RIa subunit of the holo enzyme was bound to the 8-AHA cAMP surface or that during binding of the holo enzyme the complex was dissociated leaving only the RIa subunit bound to the chip surface. When 10 mM EDTA was added to the holo enzyme to facilitate dissociation of the complex prior to injection only 250 RU were bound on both the Rp-8-AHA cAMPS and the 8-AHA cAMP surfaces, which might be due to binding of RIa subunit alone. When an excess of antagonist (10 uM Rp-8-Br cAMPS or 10 uM Rp-8- (2-Furyl) cAMPS) was added to the holo enzyme, binding of holo complex was completely blocked at the Rp-8-AHA cAMPS surface, whereas no effect in binding to the 8-AHA cAMP surface was observed.<br>
To determine the EC50 values of antagonists, different concentrations of antagonists were incubated with 10 nM holo RIa and injected onto the two detection surfaces. Competitive effects of Rp-8-(2Furyl) cAMPS and Rp-8-Br cAMPS were only detectable on the Rp-8AHA cAMPS surface, whereas the binding to 8-AHA cAMP was not affected by any concentration of antagonist. The resulting EC5o's were determined on the Rp-8-AHA cAMPS surface. With an EC5o of 377 nM for Rp-8- (2-Furyl) cAMPS and an EC50 of 2.9 uM for Rp-8-Br cAMPS these data are similar to those EC5o values<br><br>
estimated by Cook assay in previous studies (EC50 = 349 nM for Rp-8- (2-Furyl) cAMPS and ECbo = 1.3 uM for Rp-8-Br cAMPS). Rp-8-(3Furyl) cAMPS was analysed in the same way and had an ECso of 743 nM (Cook assay 607 nM}. Consequently it can be concluded that the ligand binding antagonist assay on Biacore yields comparable results to the data based on activity assays.<br>
Competition binding assays on Rp-8-AHA cAMPS and 8-AHA cAMP surfaces with 10 nM Holo RIa, Holo RIa in 10 mM EDTA and Holo RIa in the presence of 10 uM of antagonists Rp-8-Br cAMPS or Rp-8-2-Furyl cAMPS were performed. Association and dissociation times of 5 minutes at a flow rate of lOul/min were recorded .<br>
Injections of 10 nM Holo RIa with 3.9 nM-8 uM Rp-8-(2-Furyl) cAMPS and 19 nM-38.4 uM Rp-8-Br cAMPS binding to Rp-8-AHA cAMPS and 8-AHA cAMP sensor surfaces gave association and dissociation times of 5 minutes at a flow rate of lOul/min.<br>
The EC50 values of antagonist Rp-8-(2Furyl) cAMPS on the Rp-8-AHA cAMPS surface were determined; the binding signal of the Holo RIa after an association time of 5 minutes at a flow rate of 10 ul/min was plotted against the log of antagonist concentration. EC5o was determined as 377 nM.<br>
The EC50 values of antagonist Rp-8-(3Furyl) cAMPS on the Rp-8-AHA cAMPS surface were determined; the binding signal of the Holo RIa after an association time of 5 minutes at a flow rate of 10 pl/min was plotted against the log of antagonist concentration. EC5o was determined as 743 nM.<br>
The EC5o values of previously known antagonist Rp-8-Br-cAMPS on the Rp-8-AHA cAMPS surface were determined; the binding signal of the Holo RIa after an association time of 5 minutes at a flow rate of 10 ul/min was plotted<br><br>
against the log of antagonist concentration. EC50 was determined as 2.6 yM.<br>

Pre-clinical testing in human T cells, ex vivo clinical<br>
testing in HIV+ T cells.<br>
cAMP analogs were characterized with regard to agonist or antagonist properties, potencies and toxic effects using an assay where it was possible to evaluate the effects of the compounds on T lymphocyte proliferation. Human peripheral T lymphocytes were activated to proliferation<br>
in a polyclonal fashion by cross-linking of the CD3 surface markers. The cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of various new cAMP analogs in the absence and presence of the PKA type I agonist Sp-8-Br-cAMPS, added to mimic the elevated level of cAMP in T lymphocytes from HIV-infected individuals.<br>
Based on the Rp configuration of their chiral phosphorus, the compounds would be expected to display antagonist properties. The compounds tested were derivatives of Rp-8-Br-cAMPS with substitutions in the 8-position of the adenine ring. This position is an electron drawing centre that provides drug target selectivity. Modifications in this position were expected to yield compounds with stronger affinity for binding site B on the R subunit of PKA type I and thus higher potency and improved selectivity.<br>
Table 4 summarizes the properties of cAMP analog compounds tested using human primary T lymphocytes. Several modifications of the cAMP molecule have been made at various positions, but so far none has led to any. improvement in potency and selectivity compared to the starting compound Rp-8-Br-cAMPS detected using T lymphocyte proliferation assays. However, some compounds (see Table 4) were shown to be more potent than the reference compound Rp-8-Br-cAMPS when tested directly on the PKA type I holoenzyme using an enzymatic assay (see Table 4).<br>

Figure 1 . Treatment of infected mice with PKA type I antagonists reduces the frequency of TNF-a secreting CD4 T cells. The frequency of TNF-a positive cells was evaluated by intracytoplasmic staining. Cells were analysed after staphylococcal enterotoxin (SEE) or in basal conditions. The effect of Rp-8-Br-cAMP on SEE stimulated secretion was significant with p=0.0012. The effect of Rp-8-Furyl was also significant at p=0.0041.<br>
Treatment of Rp-8-Br-cAMP dramatically reduced TNF-a secretion by CD4 T cells of infected mice (figure 1) . MAIDS was characterized by a strong increase of the frequency of CD44 T cells secreting TNF-a, either spontaneously of after stimulation with SEE. In treated mice, this frequency was reduced to near normal values. In the case of Rp-8-Br-cAMP, this could not be attributed to toxic effect since proliferative responses to anti-CD3 mAb were actually increased. Rp-8-Furyl-cAMP inhibited TNF-a secretion by CD4" T cells from the infected animals. In these experiments, Rp-8-Furyl-cAMP and Rp-8-Br-cAMP had similar effects on spontaneous and SEB-induced secretion of TNF-a by CD4+ T cells (figure 1). Rp-8-Br-cAMP and Rp-8-(2-furyl)-cAMPS treatment modified the secretory profile of CD4" T cells from the infected mice, slightly increasing IFN-Y (botshown) and reducing TNF-a secretion after stimulation with staphylococcal enterotoxin SEB. This indicates that treatment with this class of agents could improve Thl immune responses directed against opportunistic intracellular pathogens while helping to reduce inflammatory manifestations of the syndrome.<br><br>
EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS FOR EXAMPLES 81 TO 85 Cook coupled enzyme assay for PKA Preparation of the RIa holoenzyme complex:<br>
Holoenzyme formation was performed by overnight dialysis of PKA RIa and PKA Ccx in a molar ratio of 1.2 to 1.0. Three 1 1 buffer changes (dialysis buffer: 20 mM MOPS pH 7.0, ISO mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 100 uM ATP, 5 mM p-mercapto-ethanol) were carried out to remove the cAMP from the regulatory subunit.<br>
Test of holoenzyme complex formation and assay conditions:<br>
Holoenzyme} was diluted (dilution buffer: 100 mM MOPS pH 7.0; 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM ATP, 1 mM DTT) to a 1 uM stock solution and tested for activity in the Cook assay (assay mix: 100 mM MOPS pH 7.0, 10 mM MgCl2, I mM phosphoenol pyruvate, 1 mM ATP, 200 uM NADH, 1 mM DTT, 15 U/ml lactate dehydrogenase, 70 U/ml pyruvate kinase) . Reaction was started by mixing 1 pi 25 mM kemptide (200 uM final concentration of active peptide) to 1 ul holoenzyme (10 nM final concentration) in 100 ul total volume of assay mix. OD34o was monitored for 1 minute and relative activity of Ca was plotted as slope of OD-decay/minute. Only a small residual activity of Ca (
Determination of the activation constant of cAMP was performed by increasing concentrations of cAMP in a 3 minute preincubation with 10 nM Holo enzyme in assay mix (ECb0= 88 nM) .<br>
Preparation of the Rlla holo complex:<br>
Holo enzyme formation was performed by over night dialysis of PKA Rlla and PKA Ca in a molar ratio of 1.2 to 1.0. Although the formation of holo Rlla does not require ATP/Mg, the same dialysis buffer as for holo RIa formation<br><br>
(20 mM MOPS pH 7.0, 150 mM NaCl, lOOuM ATP, ImM MgCl2) was used again, because ATP is required in the assay by Cook and this buffer mimics the in vivo conditions. Complete holo formation and holo activation by luM cAMP was checked before and after the titration experiments. Even after four weeks on ice holo Rlla showed the same residual activity of PKA Ca of 21% and could be fully activated by cAMP as freshly prepared.<br>
Preparation of Rp-cAMPS stock solutions:<br>
All Rp-cAMPS analogs were dissolved in dilution buffer with 20?, DMSO to a final concentration of 10 mM and the concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically using molar extinctions coefficients at Amax. Further dilutions of the Rp-cAMPS analogs were prepared by repeated 1:10 fold dilutions in dilution buffer. Preferably 1 ul but not more than 5 ul of Rp-cAMPS analog was added to the assay-mix. Therefore the DMSO concentration in the final assay mix was not higher than 1%. The effect of DMSO on the assay enzymes was tested and the results showed that DMSO concentrations of 1% or more had no effect on the assay enzymes (ADP columns) and Holo RIa (Ca, Holo RIa and cAMP activated Holo RIa columns).<br>

Three 1 1 buffer changes (dialysis buffer: 20 mM MOPS pH 7.0, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 100 uM ATP, 5 mM P-mercapto-ethanol) were carried out to remove the cAMP from the regulatory subunit. Both holo enzyme complexes were used and tested in previous studies.<br><br>
Preparation of the Rp-8-AHA cAMPS and 8-AHA cAMP surfaces:<br>
Both nucleotides were dissolved in 100 mM borate buffer pH 8.5 to a concentration of 3 mM and coupled covalently to a CMS sensor chip by standard amino coupling using EDC/NHS. An untreated CM dextran surface was used as the blank<br>
surface.<br>

For holo RIa running buffer I and for holo RIIoc running buffer 2 was used. Ten to fourteen different concentrations of PKA agonists or antagonists in an appropriate range were used to determine the EC50 values of these cAMP analogs. Therefore the binding signal on both the Rp-8-AHA cAMPS and the 8-AHA cAMP surface after 5 minutes of association time was plotted against the log of compound concentration.

Pre-clinical testing in human T cells, ex vivo clinical testing in HIV+ T cells.<br>
Negative selection of peripheral blood CD3+ T cells: Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were routinely isolated from buffycoat through density gradient centrifugation with lymphoprep solution. The majority of the thrombocytes isolated together with the PBMC were removed through washing in PBS. Isolation of T lymphocytes from PBMC was based on removal of monocytes with the CD14 surface marker and B lymphocytes with the CD19 surface marker using monodisperse magnetic beads coated with antibodies against the respective cell specific markers.<br>
Ten mL buffycoat and 25 mL PBS were added to each 50 mL tube and mixed. Ten mL lymphoprep solution was layered at the bottom of the tubes and they were centrifuged at 800 x g for 25 min at 4 °C with minimum brake. The layer of PBMC was isolated and washed twice in PBS (centrifugation at 300 x g for 7 min at 4 °C). The pellet was suspended in RPMI 1640/10 % FCS/PS, and the number of PBMC was counted. Dynabeads CD14 and GDI9 were washed six times in RPMI 1640/10 % FCS/PS using a MPC, then mixed with PBMC (3 x 101 cells/mL) at a bead to cell ratio of 5:1 (PBMC were estimated to contain 20 % monocytes and 20 % B lymphocytes) and placed on a rocking platform at 4 °C. After 45 min the positively selected cells (monocytes and B lymphocytes) were removed from the cell mixture using a MPC, leaving a suspension of T lymphocytes. The number of T lymphocytes was counted, and the cells were used in experiments or cultured in a suspension of 1-2 x 106 cells per mL RPMI 1640/10 % FCS/PS at 37 °C and 5 % C02.<br>
Proliferation assays:<br>
Proliferation assays were carried out to study the potency of various cAMP analogs as inhibitors or enhancers of proliferation of T lymphocytes. Hundred thousand<br><br>
negatively selected T lymphocytes were incubated in a total volume of 100 uL RPM1 1640/10 % FCS/PS in each well of flat-bottom, 96-well microtiter plates. Activation of the cells was achieved by addition of anti-CD3 antibodies at a final dilution of 1:10" (50 ng/mL) and subsequent cross-linking of the TCR/CD3 complex by addition of magnetic beads coated with Sheep anti-Mouse IgG at a bead to cell ratio of 1:1. The beads were washed six times in RPMI 1640/10 % FCS/PS using a MPC prior to addition to the cell suspension. The cells were incubated for 65 h at 37 °C and 5 % C02 and proliferation was examined by adding 5 yCi lmethyl-3H] thymidine after 48 h of this period. The cells were harvested onto filter-plates using a multisample harvester, and the filter-plates were dried in a heat incubator at 50°C for 2 h. 20uL scintillation liquid was added to each well and proliferation was subsequently measured by p-scintillation counting. All analyses were done in triplicates.<br>
Treatment of activated T lymphocytes with cAMP analogs:<br>
T lymphocytes were treated with increasing concentrations of various cAMP analogs, added 30 min prior to activation of the cells by the addition of anti-CD3 antibodies to allow diffusion of the compounds into the cells. The potency of each analog to inhibit or stimulate cell proliferation was determined by measuring [methyl-3H)thymidine incorporation as a function of cAMP analog concentration.<br>
Proof of principle experiments in a mouse retrovirus-induced immunodeficiency, rourine AIDS Animals:<br>
C57BL6 mice were infected with a viral preparation containing the defective virus responsible for MAIDS (titrated with the XC plaque assay and containing 103 PFU<br><br>
ecotropic virus) and treated by the different pharmacological agents around week 10 post-infection.<br>
Treatments:<br>
The different compounds were administrated during 10 days by iterative IP injections or insertion of osmotic pumps. The following agents were tested:<br>
-	Rp-8-Br-cAMP : 1 mg/day/mouse<br>
-	Rp-8-Furyl-cAMP : two dosages were tested 1 mg/day/mouse<br>
and 2.5 mg/day/mouse<br>
-	Rofecoxib : 60pg/day/mouse<br>
Infected mice received intralipid or PBS injections as shams for rofecoxib or Rp-Br/Furyl-cAMP respectively. Usually, each experimental group contained 6 to 9 animals. When the cells were cultured after the sacrifice of the animal, the different agents were added to the culture medium.<br>
Proliferation and cytokine assays:<br>
After the sacrifice of the animals, the cells were cultured for 72 hours in the presence of anti-CD3 mAb (2C11 : 4ug/ml). Tritiated thymidine was added at the end of the culture and radioactivity was measured on a<br>
scintillation analyzer.<br>
In addition to the proliferation assay performed on lymph nodes lymphocytes in response to the anti-CD3 Ab, we measured the secretion of TNFa on CD4+ T cells after 6h activation with SEE using the intracytoplasmic staining method.<br><br>
