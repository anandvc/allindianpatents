NICKLE CATALYST FOR HYDROGENATIONS REACTIONS<br>
		The invention relates to a catalyst comprising nickel, alumina<br>
	magnesium and silica, to a method for preparing such a catalyst and to a<br>
	process for hydrogenating unsaturated organic compounds.<br>
		Nickel/alumina catalysts with a nickel/aluminium ratio of 2-20 are<br>
5	known to be active catalysts for the hydrogenation of unsaturated organic<br>
	compounds from EP-A 0 167 201. The catalysts claimed in EP-A 0 167 201<br>
	further comprise silica in a nickel/silica ratio of 1-20. The disclosed catalysts<br>
	are prepared in a process wherein first a nickel hydroxide/carbonate is<br>
	precipitated and thereafter aluminium nitrale and silicate are added. The<br>
10	resulting precipitate is thereafter activated with hydrogen. The examples show<br>
	catalysts comprising at least 85 wt. % Ni that are used in the hydrogenation of<br>
	fish oil. It is reported that they may retain their activity for a prolonged period<br>
	and tend to show a high poison resistance. As an indication for selectivity an<br>
	aspecific assay is referred to, based on a combination of melting point and<br>
15	hydrogenation time. Besides the fact that the latter parameter has been found<br>
	to be rather an indicator for activity, no quantitative data are presented on the<br>
	selectivity in soy bean oil hydrogenation though.<br>
		EP-A 1 101 530 describes a nickel-iron catalyst for use in the<br>
	hydrogenation of resins. Magnesium (oxide) may be present. This publication<br>
20	does not recognise the relevance of the particle size with respect to the<br>
	hydrogenation of unsaturated compounds and the working examples do not<br>
	mention the particle size of the used catalyst. It is not suggested to use the<br>
	catalyst in the hydrogenation of fatty substances, such as vegetable or animal<br>
	oils.<br>
25		US-A 5 493 037 relates to a fixed bed process for hydrogenating fatty<br>
	acids, comprising the use of a formed nickel catalyst with a relatively low<br>
	nickel content. Contents of 10-50 wt. % are mentioned, without specifying how<br><br>
WO 2004/035204							PCT/NL2003/000705 <br>
2<br>
	the weight percentage is defined. A magnpsiuin salt may be present as a<br>
	support or in the binder (clay). The publication is silent about suitable pore<br>
	volumes and nickel surface areas.<br>
		There is a continuing need for alternative catalysts for the<br>
5	hydrogenation of unsaturated organic compounds. In general when searching<br>
	for a suitable catalyst for the bydragenation of a particular compound, one has<br>
	to compromise e.g. between activity and selectivity. For instance, certain<br>
	catalyst characteristics (e.g. an open pore structure) may favour the selective<br>
	hydrogenation of fatty oils while al the same tune result in longer reaction<br>
10	times when hydrogenating more contaminated oils because of their higher<br>
	susceptibility to poisoning. Therefore, often different types of catalysts are<br>
	required for different types of unsaturated organic compounds. For example, a<br>
	atalyst may either be suitable for clean oils, such as soy bean oil, or for more<br>
	ontaminated oils, such as rape seed oil or fish oil.<br>
15		 is an object of the present invention to provide a novel catalyst<br>
	hat may be used as a favourable alternative to known catalysts for<br>
	ydrogenating unsaturated organic compounds, in particular fatty oils.<br>
		 has been found that this object can be realised by a catalyst<br>
	omprising nickel, silica, alumina and also magnesium in a particular ratio.<br>
20	ccordingly, the present invention relates to a catalyst comprising<br>
	nickel, silica, alumina and magnesium, whereni the nickel to magnesium<br>
	atomic ratio is 5-75, preferably 5-50.<br>
		In the catalyst, magnesium is thought to act as a catalyst promotor<br>
	in the hydrogenation of urtsaturated hydrocarbons, in particular fatty<br>
25	substances, as is indicated by the Examples 1 and 2, below.<br>
		In particular, the present invention relates to a catalyst comprising<br>
	nickel, silica, alumina and magnesium, wherein the nickel to silicium atomic<br>
	ratio (Ni/Si) is 2 to 30, the nickel to aluminium atomic ratio (Ni/AI) is 9 to 40<br>
	and the nickel to magnesium atomic ratio (Ni/Mg) is 5-75.<br><br>
WO 2004/-03524							PCT/NL2003/000705<br>
3<br>
		It baa been found that a catalyst according to the present invention<br>
	shows a very high activity for the hydrogenation of unsaturated compounds, in<br>
	particular unsaturated fatty substances, such as fatty oils including<br>
	ucsaturated fats. These oils typically mainly comprise glycerides, in particular<br>
5	triglycerides. The invention may very suitably be employed for the<br>
	hydrogenation of fatty substances of vegetable and/or animal origin for food<br>
	grade applications.<br>
		A catalyst according to the invention has been found to have a very<br>
	high, activity as a hydrogenation catalyst. In particular, a catalyst according to<br>
10	the invention is found to be hignly active for relatively clean oils - i.e. oils with<br>
	a relatively low sulphur conteat - like soy bean, as well as for more<br>
	contaminated oils, lite fish oil, having a high sulphur content.<br>
		A catalyst according to the invention may very suitably be used in a<br>
	slurry process. Accordingly the present invention also relates to a slurry<br>
15	ejomprising a catalyst according to the invention. The skilled person will know<br>
	how to make a suitable slurry based upon common general knowledge and the<br>
	information disclosed herein. For instance, as a liquid phase the feed stock to<br>
	be processed is very suitable.<br>
		The total weight percentage of Ni in the reduced catalyst may be<br>
20	chosen in a wide range, as defined by the Ni/Si, Ni/Al and Ni/Mg ranges.<br>
	Preferably, the amount of nickel is at least 50 wt. % and not higher than<br>
	80 wt. %, more preferably 51-80 wt. %. Even more preferably the amount of<br>
	nickel is 55-75 wt.%. Very good results have been achieved with an amount of<br>
	nickel of 65-72 wt.%.<br>
25		In a preferred embodiment, Ni/Si is at least about 2.5, more<br>
	preferably at least about 3. Very good results have been achieved with a Ni/Si<br>
	of at least 6.5.<br>
		The Ni/Si is preferably about 22 or less, more preferably about 15 or<br>
less. Very good results have been achieved with a Ni/Si of up to about 7.5.<br><br>
WO 2004/035204							PCT/NL2003/000705 <br>
4<br>
		Ni/Al is preferably about 10 to about 35, more preferably about 10-<br>
	30, even more preferably about 15-25. Very good results have been achieved<br>
	with a catalyst having a Ni/Al of more than 20, e.g. up to 22.<br>
		Ni/Mg may preferably be chosen in the range of about 5-50, more<br>
5	preferably 5-30, even more preferably about 6 to about 20. "Very suitable is a<br>
	catalyst with a Ni/Mg of about 7.5-12.5, e.g. about. 10.<br>
		In principle it is possible that small amounts of one or more other<br>
	elements are present in the catalyst, but this is not required. In particular,<br>
	very suitable is a catalyst of tile invention which is essentially free of iron<br>
10	(typically having less than 0.1 % Fe).<br>
		In order to prevent oxidation of the catalyst may be coated with a<br>
	protective layer. The protective layer may have any form, wherein at least the<br>
	cataiytically active sites of the catalyst are essentially covered with a<br>
	protective material.<br>
15		Protection of the catalyst is in principle possible by applying a layer<br>
	of oxide on the catalyst, in particular on the nickel (crystallites). A method for<br>
	applying a suitable film of oxide is known in generally known in the art, and<br>
	may be based on DB19909175. The oxide may suitably be removed shortly<br>
	before use. The skilled person will know now to remove (e.g. by reactivation)<br>
20	the oxide, based upon a known method for reactivating known nickel catalysts<br>
	on a support (e.g. on alumina, silica or a combination thereof).<br>
		A highly suitable protective material for protecting a catalyst, such<br>
	as a hydrogenation catalyst, in particular a catalyst according to the invention,<br>
	is a material comprising a fatty substance, preferably a hardened oil or fat,<br>
25	more preferably a hardened vegetable oil or fat. Very good results have been<br>
	achieved with, a catalyst coated with hardened soy bean fat. Other highly<br>
	preferred examples of fatty substances include hardened palm oil fat,<br>
	hsrdsned sunflower oil and hardened rapessed oil. A mixture comprising a<br>
	number of fatty substances may very suitably be used.<br><br>
WO 2004/035204							PCT7NL2003/000705<br>
5<br>
		An advantage of a protective material comprising a fatty substance<br>
	instead of a thin film of oxide on the catalyst, is that the catalyst does not need<br>
	to be re-activated before use. At a high temperature (e.g. above about 150 °C)<br>
	re-activation will generally be possible without a problem but in particular for<br>
5	low temperature applications or for applications wherein the reaction is<br>
	started at a relatively low temperature (e.g. below 150 °C), re-activation of a<br>
	catalyst with a protective oxide film may take a relatively long time, resulting<br>
	in a longer overall reaction time, or may not take place to a sufficient extent at<br>
	all.<br>
10		The protective material forming a protective layer may be provided<br>
	around individualised particles, or at least on the catalytically active part<br>
	thereof (in particular in case a layer of oxide).<br>
		In particular in case of a catalyst provided with a fatty substance as<br>
	a protective layer, a multiplicity of catalyst particles may be incorporated (in<br>
15	particular dispersed) into the protective material forming the protective layer.<br>
		The protective material with catalyst particles incorporated therein,<br>
	may very suitably be in the form of a participate material. Such particulate<br>
	material is also referred to herein as matrix particles. The size of the matrix<br>
	particles is not particularly critical. Conveniently, matrix particles may for<br>
20	instance have a size (as defined by the diameter of the enveloping circle) in the<br>
	range of about 1 to about 12 mm, more in particular in the range of about 2-10<br>
	mm. The size of the catalyst particles incorporated therein is usually at least<br>
	bout one or two orders of magnitude less than the matrix particles. A<br>
	referred size of the catalyst particles is as the preferred particle diameters<br>
25	efined below .<br>
		 has been found that in particular in an embodiment wherein the<br>
	atalyst is provided with a protective layer by having the catalyst incorporated<br>
	nto the protective material, the ease of handling is improved, because it<br>
	ontributes to reduced dusting of the catalyst.<br><br>
WO 2004/035204							PCT/NL2O03/000705<br>
6<br>
		The amount of protective material is preferably at least about 40<br>
	wt. %, more preferably at least about 55 wt. % even more preferably at least<br>
	about 60 wt. %. Very good results have been achieved with an amount of at<br>
	least 65 wt. %. (All wt. %'s based upon the total weight of catalyst plus<br>
5	protective material).<br>
		Preferably tbe amount of protective material is less than about<br>
	95 wt. %, more preferably less than about 90 wt.%, even more preferably less<br>
	than about 85 wt. %. Very good results have been achieved with a weight<br>
	percentage of up to about 82 wt % (All wt. %'s based upon the total weight of<br>
10	catalyst plus protective material).<br>
		The melting temperature of the protective material with which the<br>
	catalyst is coated is preferably leas than, the temperature at which the<br>
	hydrogenation is carried out, in order to facilitate dissolution of the protective<br>
	material at the beginning of a hydrogenation process in accordance with the<br>
15	invention. Good results have inter alia been achieved with a protective<br>
	material have a melting temperature of less than about 90oC, more in<br>
	particular of less than about 35oC. Very good results have been achieved with<br>
	a melting temperature of less than 80°C.<br>
		For practical reasons, the minimum melting temperature of the<br>
20	protective material is in general higher than the temperature at which the<br>
	catalyst is stored before use. Preferably the melting temperature is at least<br>
	about 40°C, more preferably at least about 50oC.<br>
		In particular, when the catalyst is used in a slurry process, the<br>
	protective coating will preferably dissolve in the feedstock. Else, the coating<br>
25	may be removed from the process, shortly before using the catalyst in a<br>
	hydrogenation process. The coating may very suitably be removed by<br>
	contacting the catalyst with a solvent, such as a feedstock, preferably at a<br>
	temperature higher than the melting point of the coating fat.<br>
		For a good activity, the pore volume (as measured by N2 desorption,<br>
30	20-600 A, on a Quantachrome Autosorb 6) is preferably at least 0.4 ml/g, more<br><br>
WO 2004/035204							PCT/NL2003/000705<br>
7<br>
	preferably at least 0.5 ml/g, even more preferably at least 0.55 ml/g. The upper<br>
	limit is not particularly critical. Very good results have been achieved in the<br>
	range of 0.4 to 1 ml/g. More preferably, the pore volume is up to about 0.75<br>
	ml/g, e.g. 0.6-0.7 ml/g.<br>
5		The volume average particle size (D(v.0,5)) of a catalyst according to<br>
	the invention may be chosen in a wide range, inter alia depending upon the<br>
	intended use, in particular if the catalyst is provided with a protective coating.<br>
		In practice, in particular for improving the hydrogenation reaction<br>
	rate of unsaturated fatty substances, one may favourably choose to use a<br>
10	catalyst with a D(v_0,5) of less than about 20 µm. Very suitable is a D(v.0,5) of<br>
	less than about 15 µm, in particular of less than about 10 µm, more in<br>
	particular of less than about 8.5 µm.<br>
		The volume average particle size is preferably at least about 1 µm.<br>
	more preferably at least about 2 µm, even more preferably at least about 3.<br>
15		A volume average particle size in the range of about 3 to about 8 µm<br>
	has been found to be highly advantageous. In particular when compared to a<br>
	catalyst with a higher average particle size (e.g. 8.6 µm) such a catalyst has<br>
	been found to have a higher activity with respect to hydrogenation of a<br>
	unsaturated organic compound, especially a fatty substance.<br>
20		Very good results have been achieved with a catalyst having a<br>
	volume average particle size of about 4 to about 7µm.<br>
		D(v.0,5), as used herein, is the value as measured by LASER<br>
	diffraction with a Malvern MS 1002, lens 45 mm - which corresponds to a<br>
	measuring range of 0.1-100 µm - using "Independent" as the model for<br>
25	calculating the particle size. The (D(v.0,5)) as used herein is the diameter of<br>
	the catalyst per se, i.e. without a protective coating.<br>
		The catalyst preferably comprises nickel crystallites. The majority of<br>
	the nickel crystallites preferably has a diameter of less tlian 60 Aµ, more<br>
	preferably of about 20-50 Aµ, even more preferably of about 20-40 Aµ. The size as<br>
30	used herein is the value as determinable by XRD on the reduced catalyst<br><br>
WO 2004/035204							PCT/NL2003/OO0705<br>
8<br>
	protected by a coating of a fatty substance (such as hardened soybean fat) (See<br>
	also Examples).<br>
		The nickel surface area is preferably 75 to 200 m2/g of nickel, more<br>
	preferably approximately 100-175 m2/g of nickel, ever more preferably<br>
5	approximately 100-150 m2/g of nickel. Very good results have been achieved<br>
	with, a catalyst having a nickel surface area of 110-145 m2/g of nickel. The<br>
	nickel surface area as used herein is the value can be determined by<br>
	hydrogen chemisorption at 50 °C, after in situ reduction with hydrogen (60<br>
	ml/rain) for 2 hours at 400 °C and subsequently degassing for 14 hours at 350<br>
10	°C in a Carlo Erba Sorptomatic 1900. The amount of adsorbed hydrogen is<br>
	determined by extrapolation of the reduction isotherm to zero pressure and the<br>
	nickel surface area is calculated assuming a site density of 6.77 Å2/atom.<br>
		The BET surface area preferably is about 300 to about 450 m2/g<br>
	catalyst, more preferably about 350 to about 400 m2/g catalyst. The BET<br>
15	surface avea as used herein is toe value that can be measured by determining<br>
	the amount of nitrogen adsorbed at 77 K and P/Po of approximately 0.3 and<br>
	assuming a nitrogen cross sectional area of 16.2 Â 2, after degassing the<br>
	catalyst sample at 180°C.<br>
		The average pore diameter (APD), as calculated from the measured<br>
20	pore volume (PV) and BET surface area by the formula APD= 4000G*PV/BET,<br>
	rnay for example very suitably be chosen in the range of about 10-500 Å,<br>
	preferably in the range of about 40- 200 Å, more preferably about 60 - 100 Å.<br>
		It is possible to make a catalyst in a process wherein first a nickel<br>
	precipitate is made, which is subsequently aged with an alumina source and<br>
25	with a silica source (which may be added together with the alumina or<br>
	thereafter).<br>
		In a preferred embodiment, the catalyst is made from a catalyst<br>
	precursor that is prepared by co-precipitation., of which it will be clear to the<br>
	skilled professional how to choose suitable method conditions, In a co-<br>
30	precipitation method according to the invention nickel, alumina, silica and<br><br>
WO 2004/035204							PCT/NL2003/000705<br>
9<br>
	magnesium are precipitated together (i.e. without forming intermediate<br>
	precipitates of only one or some of the camponents). In such a method, a nickel<br>
	source, a silica source, an alumina source and a magnesium source may be<br>
	mixed, in a liquid, (e.g. water or an aqueous solution) to form a precipitate (a<br>
5	catalyst precursor), comprising all four said coinponents-<br>
		Prefexably the co-precipitation ia carried out with the aid of a<br>
	precipitant, e.g. an alkali metal carbonate (such as Na2CO3) or an alkali, metal<br>
	hydroxide (such as NaOH).<br>
		It is an advantage of the above co-precipitation methodology that it<br>
10	can be performed in a single co-precipitation step.<br>
		Very good results have been achieved with a method wherein the co-<br>
	precipitation is performed at alkaline pH, e.g. at a pH of approximately 7.5-8.5<br>
	(as measured at 25 °C). It has been found that under alkaline conditions a very<br>
	efficient, generally a substantially complete precipitation of nickel and<br>
15	magnesium, can be realised, in particular at elevated temperatures e.g. in the<br>
	range of 50-100 °C.<br>
		In a preferred embodiment, the precipitation is carried out at a<br>
	temperature in the range of 20-100 °C . Very good results have been achieved<br>
	at a temperature in the range of 50-100 °C, in particular at a temperature in<br>
20	the range of 75-98oC. The catalyst precursor may thereafter be isolated, e.g.<br>
	by filtration, from the liquid and calcined, e.g. at a temperature of 200-750 °C<br>
	for 1-5 hours. The catalyst may very suitably be activated by reduction with<br>
	hydrogen, e.g. at a temperature of 250-600 °C, e.g. for 1-5 hours.<br>
		The nickel, silica, alurnina and magnesium sources may be chosen<br>
25	from sources commonly used to prepare catalysts.<br>
		Suitable nickel sources include inorganic nickel salts, preferably<br>
	Ni(NO3)2, NiCl2, NiSO4, and organic nickel salts, preferably nickel acetate.<br>
	Preferably the nickel source is a solution or suspension of any of these salts.<br><br>

		Suitable silica sources include water glass, sodium silicate (Na2SiO3)<br>
	and colloidal silica. Preferably the silica source is a solution or suspension of<br>
	any of these components.<br>
		Suitable alumina sources include aluminium salts, preferably<br>
5	inorganic salts suck as AlCl3, Al(NO3)3 and sadium aluminate (NaAlO2).<br>
	Preferably the alumina source is a solution or suspension of any of these salts.<br>
		Suitable magnesium sources include magnesium salts, preferably<br>
	inorganic salts such as Mg(NO3)2, MgCl2, and MgSO4. Preferably the<br>
	magnesium source is a solution or suspension of any of these salts.<br>
10		The catalyst may be coated with a protective layer, e.g. a fatty<br>
	substance such as hardened soy bean fat, nardened palm oil fat, hardened sun<br>
	flower oil fat or a combination thereof, which may serve to avoid oxidation of<br>
	(parts 01) the catalyst (see also above).<br>
		The skilled person will know haw to provide a protective coating,<br>
15	based upon common general knowledge and the information disclosed herein.<br>
	This may for example be done by blending a (reduced) catalyst powder into the<br>
	molten coating material (such as the molten fat) and subsequently solidifying<br>
	the resulting suspension to form flakes or droplets of coated catalyst particles.<br>
	For instance, one may let droplets of the suspension fall on a surface having a<br>
20	temperature below the melting temperature of the fatty substance (such as a<br>
	cooled plate) thereby solidifying the droplets to form matrix particles. Such<br>
	method is very suitable for preparing particles generally having an essentially<br>
	hemispherical shape. Another way to produce matrix particles is to let the<br>
	droplets fell in a fluid (generally cooled fluid) wherein the particles solidify.<br>
25	Thus more or less spherical matrix particles may be formed. It is also an<br>
	option to flake the suspension to flakes of a suitable thickness.<br>
		A catalyst according to the present invention may be used for a<br>
	variety of applications, and in particular for catalytic hydrogenation. The<br>
	catalyst may be employed in a process for hydrogenating organic compounds<br>
30	wherein said compound is contacted with hydrogen in the presence of the<br><br>
WO 2004/035204							PCT/NL2003/000705<br>
11<br>
	catalyst. The process conditions may be chosen from the processes typically<br>
	used for the hydrogenation of a particular compound. The process may be a<br>
	batch or a continuous process. Preferably, the process is a slurry-process.<br>
		An important advantage of a hydrogenation process according to the<br>
5	invention is the possibility to decrease the dosage of catalyst in order to<br>
	achieve a particular conversion within the same hydrogenation time (contact<br>
	time of feed (substrate) and catalyst) or to reduce the hydrogenation time at a<br>
	particular catalyst dosage.<br>
		A process according to the invention has been found to be<br>
10	particularly suitable for the hydrogenation of a relatively clean oil (e.g. soy<br>
	bean oil) and/or a more contaminated oil (e.g. fish oil or rape seed oil).<br>
		A fatty substance hydrogenated in accordance with the present<br>
	invention preferably mainly comprises triglycerides, such that the content of<br>
	free fatty acids is quite low. For instance in a preferred feed stock<br>
15	hydrogenated in accordance with the invention, such as a fully refined<br>
	vegetable or animal oils, usually less than about 0.1 wt.% free fatty acids and<br>
	preferably less than 0.05 wt.% is present. Since high concentrations of free<br>
	fatty acids may deactivate the catalyst by nickel soap formation, their presence<br>
	is preferably below said levels.<br>
20		On the one hand it has been found, possible to maintain a high<br>
	activity in the presence of contaminations such as sulphur in the contaminated<br>
	oil. On the other hand the selectivity has been found to remain high enough to<br>
	achieve a favourable conversion of the unsaturated compounds. As a result the<br>
	present invention also offers a considerable advantage since it offers the<br>
25	advantage that a single type of catalyst can very favourably be used in the<br>
	hydrogenation of contaminated oil and also in the hydrogenation of clean oil.<br>
	Thus a single stock of catalyst may be kept for the conversion of either of these<br>
	products.<br>
		The invention will now be illustrated by the following examples.<br>
30<br><br>
WO 2004/035204							PCT/NL2003/000705<br>

	Example 1<br>
		A metal solution (1000 ml) containing 95 g Ni/1 and 5g Mg/l was<br>
	prepared from a NiCl2 solution (198 g Ni/1) and MgCl2.6H2O. The base solution<br>
5	was prepared by dissolving 183 g Na2CO3 and 44.4 g Na2SiO3.5H2O in 1000 ml<br>
	of demineralised water. The metal and base solution were injected at equal<br>
	flaw sates (1000 ml/hr) into a. well stirred precipitation vessel containing<br>
	1725 ml of demineralised water and 3.8 g of Al2O2 as sodium aluminate. The<br>
	temperature during precipitation wae maintained at 90 oC while the pH was<br>
10	between 7.5 and 8.5.<br>
		After precipitation the precipitate was washed with demineralised water<br>
	and dried overnight at 110 °C. The dried catalyst was calcined for 1.5 hours at<br>
	375 oC and subsequently activated by reduction in hydrogen for 2 hours at<br>
	400 °C. The reduced catalyst powder was protected from air oxidation by<br>
15	dispersing it in an inert atmosphere in molten, hardened soybean, fat at 80-<br>
	100 °C. Catalyst flakes were formed by solidifying the blend of reduced<br>
	catalyst powder and coating fat on a cooling plate. The catalyst properties of<br>
	the calcined sample are as summarised in Table 1.<br>
20	Example 2<br>

	procedure as described with example 1, except that magnesium was replaced<br>
	by copper and cobalt respectively.<br>
	Example 8<br>
15<br>
		The catalyst of Example 8 was prepared according to the procedure as<br>
	describedin Example 1 except that a different agitation speed was used during<br>
	the precipitation, (an agitation speed of 400 instead of 475 rpm was used).<br>
20	Example 9: Characterisation and performance of the catalysts<br>
		The pore volume and BET surface area of the catalysts were measured<br>
	by nitrogen adsorption/desorption using a Quantachrome Autosorb-6. Particle<br>
	size was determined by laser diffraction using a Malvern Mastersizer 1002.<br>
25	The nickel surface area was measured by hydrogen chemisorption with a Carlo<br>
	Erba Sorptometic 1900.<br>
		The nickel crystallite size was measured with a Phillips DW1820<br>
	roöntgeii diffractometer using the Ni(111) peak (d-value 2.06 Ä).<br>
		The soy bean oil (SBO) hydrogenating activity of the catalysts was<br>
30	determined by the hydrogenation of 500 g of soybean oil (iodine value 130) and<br><br>
WO 2004/035204							PCT/NL2003/000705<br>

	was 0.0075% as nickel, the hydrogen pressure was 0.7 bar and the<br>
	temperature was 204 °C. Tbe iodine value was measured by the Wijs melhod<br>
	as described in A.O.C.S. Official Method Cd 1-25 (1990).<br>
5		The fish, oil (FO) bydrogenation activity of the catalysts was determined<br>
	by the hydrogenation of 500 g of fish oil (iodine vylue 160) at 180 °C, 2 bar<br>
	hydrogen pressure and a nickel loading of 0.031%. The activity is exprsssad as<br>
	the time in minutes required to reach an iodine value (IV) of 115. The iodine<br>
	value was measured by the Wijs method.<br>
