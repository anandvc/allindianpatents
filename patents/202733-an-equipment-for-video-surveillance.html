Date: May 12, 2005<br><br>
PANORAMIC SURVEILLANCE DEVICE<br>
The present invention relates to the area of panoramic photographing equipment, especially for video surveillance.<br>
Various solutions for photographing at a very large angle are known in the state of the art.<br>
The solutions using aspherical lenses are not satisfactory because the cost of manufacturing them is very high and the aberrations difficult to correct with software reprocessing.<br>
The use of mirrors that deform with an optical or software anamorphic treatment is also known.<br>
By way of example, patent PCT WO9506303 describes a surveillance system for monitoring a space comprising a single camera and a convex mirror of the dome type. The camera is fixed relative to the mirror in such a manner that at least the majority of the mirror surface is situated in the field of view of the' camera- The mirror has a profile such that the radiation coming from the majority of the space is reflected by the dome-type mirror onto the picture plane of the camera. The dome-type mirror is preferably symmetric in a circular manner and its axis of symmetry is aligned relative to the optica] axis of the camera. In general, the camera is an electronic camera comprising a sensor with a charge-coupling device at the level of its picture plane. The processed image of the space produced by the camera is displayed on a monitoring screen in the form of a circular or flat image. The system for processing images of the electronic camera can comprise an algorithm for detecting movement intended to generate an alarm in case a movement is detected in the entire predetermined zone of the space.<br>
2<br><br>
Another patent published under number WO 9750252A1 relates to an apparatus for photographing panoramic views that instantaneously captures a panoramic image in 360°. According to one of the embodiments the photographic apparatus comprises a convex mirror that captures the light of the surrounding panorama, an astigmatic lens that corrects astigmatism, an objective lens that makes the light converge in a single point, a field-flattening lens that makes the images in polar format converge in two-dimensional planar images, and a mechanism for capturing images that captures two-dimensional, optimized annular images of the surrounding panorama. This panoramic photographic device also comprises various systems for displaying and distributing panoramic images. Specifically, these systems comprise a device and a process that permit the digital realization of a geometric transformation of the two-dimensional annular image in rectangular projections in such a manner that the panoramic image can be displayed in accordance with traditional processes such as printed images and televised images.<br>
The solution is intended for photographing over 360° but it produces images that can be poorly used for video surveillance.<br>
In fact, the panoramic images do not permit the correct apprehension of the details of the field covered and thus do not permit the realization of an efficient video surveillance.<br>
Solutions of video surveillance using a camera with a normal field that sweeps the volume to be surveyed are also known. This solution does permit the obtention of satisfactory images but has the disadvantage of leaving non-visualized zones during the sweeping. Hach zone to be surveilled is visualized only for a very limited time, less than the shadow time.<br>
3<br><br>
The present invention has the problem of realizing a piece of compact panoramic video surveillance equipment that avoids the disadvantages of the various solutions of the prior art.<br>
To this end the invention relates according to its most general meaning a piece of equipment for video surveillance comprising optical means for forming a panoramic image and the acquisition of this panoramic image by a camera that transmits video information to a remote viewing station, characterized in that this piece of equipment also comprises means of acquiring an image with a non-panoramic angular opening included in the panoramic photographing field, the orientation of which acquisition means is controlled relative to the field of panoramic optical means as a function of a zone of interest detected in this panoramic image.<br>
The acquisition means is advantageously constituted by an additional mobile camera along at least one axis of rotation.<br>
According to a variant the acquisition means is constituted by an additional mobile camera along two perpendicular axes of rotation.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment the means for forming the panoramic image comprises at least one mirror with axial symmetry and a curved section and the acquisition means is constituted by an additional mobile camera along the axis of symmetry of this mirror.<br>
The means for forming the panoramic image preferably comprises a main, annular mirror with a concave section pierced in its center that reflects a primary image on a secondary mirror that is round, concave and with an elliptical profile coaxial to the optical axis, which device comprises a digital image scanner arranged on the optical axis for receiving the secondary image reflected by the secondary mirror.<br>
According to particular embodiments:<br>
4<br><br>
-	The means for forming the panoramic image comprises a diaphragm interposed between the secondary mirror and the image sensor;<br>
-	The means for forming the panoramic image comprises a circular primary mirror with a hyperbolic section;<br>
-	The means for forming the panoramic image comprises a concave, elliptical secondary mirror;<br>
-	The image sensor of the means for forming the panoramic image is arranged in back as far as into a transversal plane intersecting the primary mirror;<br><br>
-	The secondary mirror of the means for forming the panoramic image is a mirror with an elliptical section;<br>
-	The means for forming the panoramic image comprises a secondary mirror formed by a concave cap with a profile with an elliptical section that ensures focusing of the primary mirror along a torus onto a sensor.<br>
The means for forming the panoramic image advantageously comprises at least one index hole placed in the field swept by the non-panoramic acquisition means.<br>
According to a variant it comprises an index hole arranged on an annular crown coaxial with the device for the acquisition of the panoramic image, and comprises a second index hole placed in a plane containing the axis of the device for the acquisition of the panoramic image.<br>
According to a particular embodiment the equipment also comprises a viewing station comprising a means for aiming at a zone of interest in the panoramic image and comprises a circuit for controlling the angular position of the non-panoramic camera as a function of information supplied by the aiming means.<br>
5<br><br>
According to an advantageous realization the aiming means comprises a tactile screen for viewing the panoramic image.<br>
According to another variant the equipment also comprises a viewing station comprising means for analyzing the panoramic image that delivers information representative of the position of a zone of interest in the panoramic image, and comprises a circuit for controlling the angular position of the non-panoramic camera as a function of information supplied by the analyzing means.<br>
According to a particular realization this analyzing means is a means for detecting local modifications of the panoramic image.<br>
The invention will be better understood from a reading of the following description that refers to the attached drawings corresponding to a non-limiting example in which:<br>
Figure 1 shows a view according to a plane in axial section of an exemplary embodiment of a device in accordance with the invention.<br>
Figure 2 shows a perspective view of a device in conformity with the invention.<br>
Figures 3 and 4 show views in partial section along a radial plane.<br>
Figure 5 shows a view of an image obtained with a device in conformity with the invention.<br>
Figure 1 shows an exemplary embodiment of a device for photographing panoramic views with a median axis of symmetry 10. The photographing field is cylindrical with an opening of approximately 70° in the radial planes.<br>
The device comprises a primary mirror 1 with an annular form and a concave section. This mirror has a central perforation. Primary mirror 1 reflects the light beams towards a secondary mirror 2 arranged coaxial ly to<br>
6<br><br>
primary mirror 1 upstream from the photographing field. Secondary mirror 2 is formed by a concave cap with a profile with an elliptical section that ensures the focusing of the primary mirror along a torus onto a sensor 4.<br>
Secondary mirror 2 reflects the light beams to an eyepiece 3 composed of one or several lenses and with an integrated diaphragm. Image sensor 4, e.g., a digital camera, receives the toroidal image adjusted by the eyepiece and delivers a digital signal. This signal is then processed by an image-processing software that ensures the correction of deformations.<br>
The main camera is placed in a transversal plane intersecting primary mirror 1.<br>
This allows the realization of a compact device.<br>
An additional camera 11 is arranged under secondary mirror 2 in the blind spot of main mirror 1. This additional camera 11 is a camera with a non-panoramic field. It can be oriented along an axis of rotation coincident with axis of symmetry 10 and along a perpendicular axis of rotation in order to permit an aiming at any zone of the field of the panoramic photographing device.<br>
This additional camera 11 supplies a detailed image that permits an enlarged view of a zone of interest on a surveillance screen.<br>
It is thus possible to proceed on the same screen or on independent screens to a global surveillance of a panoramic zone and to the analysis of a particular zone of interest appearing in the panoramic image.<br>
The selection of the zone of interest is made manually by an operator charged with the surveillance or automatically.<br>
In the first instance the operator has an aiming means that allows a zone of interest to be indicated on the screen for viewing the panoramic image.   This aiming means can be constituted in a known manner by a<br>
7<br><br>
mouse or also by a tactile screen. The superpositioning of a graphic pointer whose position is controlled by the actuating of the aiming means with a zone of the panoramic image permits the calculation of information for piloting additional camera 11. This information controls the orientation according to one or two complementary axes of rotation. The image captured by camera 11 then corresponds to an enlarged view of the zone of interest indicated on the screen for viewing the panoramic image. This image can be viewed on the same screen or on a different screen. Its display does not delete the display of the panoramic image, which allows the operator to continue surveilling the entire zone and to detect any new zone of interest.<br>
The locating of the relative position of the panoramic image and of the enlarged image can be improved by a target appearing in the field that can be visualized by the additional camera. This target can be constituted by one or several opaque or semi-opaque marks corresponding to determined positions. These marks permit a periodic updating of the detailed image by referring to a zone of interest indicated on the panoramic image.<br>
In the automatic solution the orientation of additional camera 11 is controlled by a circuit for analyzing the panoramic image that detects the zone of interest by image processing. The zones of interest can be determined by a local variation of the intensity or of the characteristics of the panoramic image.<br>
A calculator then determines the barycenter of the zone of interest indicated and calculates the information about the positioning of an additional camera 11 as a function of the position of this barycenter.<br>
8<br><br>
A semi-automatic mode consists in proposing zones of interest to the operator and a controlling the movement of additional camera 11 only in case of validation by the operator.<br>
This proposing of the zone of interest can be represented by the automatic appearance of a graphic pointer or by highlighting the zone of interest. The selection is made by actuating a validation key or by indicating the zone of interest on a tactile screen.<br>
Figure 2 shows a perspective view showing primary mirror 1 with the general shape of a truncated inverted cone generated by the displacement of a concave line along a circular path. Primary mirror 1 is pierced by opening 8. It is placed facing secondary concave mirror 2, whose diameter in the example shown is approximately identical to the diameter of primary mirror 1.<br>
Figures 3, 4 show the optical paths in a device in conformity with the example shown in figure 2. The photographing field is formed by a circular crown with an angular opening of approximately 75 °C.<br>
Figure 5 shows an image recorded with a device in conformity with the invention.<br>
