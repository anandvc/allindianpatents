RECOMBINANT SUPER-COMPOUND INTERFERON PREPARATION AND USES<br>
THEREOF<br>
The application is a continuation-in-part application of 5   U.S. Serial No. 60/498,785 filed on August 28, 2003 and U.S. Serial  No.  60/498,923  filed on August  28,  2003,  the contents of which are incorporated by reference here into this application.<br>
     Throughout  this  application,  various  references  are<br>
referred to Disclosures of these publications in their<br>
entireties are hereby incorporated by reference into this<br>
application in order to more fully describe the state of<br>
the art to which this invention pertains.<br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This  invention  is  related to a method  for producing<br>
recombinant  super-compound  interferon  (rSIFN-co)  with<br>
changed spatial configuration. One characteristic of rSIFN-<br>
     co in this invention is that it cannot only inhibit DNA<br>
(deoxyribonucleic acid)  duplication of the hepatitis B<br>
virus but also the secretion of HBsAg and HBeAg.<br>
I BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
     rSIFN-co is a new interferon molecule constructed with the most popular conservative amino acid found;; an natural human a-IFN subtypes using genetic engineering methods. United States Patent Nos. 4,695,623 and 4,897,471 have described it. rSIFN-co had been proved to have broad-spectrum IFN<br>
     activity and virus- and tumor-inhibition and natural killer cell activity. United States Patent No. 5,372,808 by Amgen, Inc. addresses treatment rSIFN-co. Chinese Patent No. 97193506.8 by Amgen, Inc. addresses re-treatment of rSIFN-co on hepatitis C. Chinese  Patent No. 98114663.5  by<br>
    Shenzhen Jiusheng Bio-engineering Ltd. addresses treatment of rSIFN-co on hepatitis B and hepatitis C.<br>
The  United  States  Food and  Drug Administration  (FDA)<br>
2<br><br>
authorized Amgen to produce rSIFN-co with E.     Coli.    for clinical hepatitis C treatment at the end of 1997.<br>
Hepatitis B patients can be identified when detecting HBsAg  and the HBeAg. a-IFN is commonly used in clinics to treat hepatitis B. IFN binds superficial cell membrane receptors, inhibiting DNA and RNA (ribonucleic acid) duplication, including inducing some enzymes to prevent duplication of the virus in hepatitis-infected cells. All IFNs can inhibit  only the DNA duplication of viruses, not the e and s antigen.<br>
An outbreak of atypical pneumonia, referred to as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and first identified in<br>
 Guangdong Province, China, has spread to several countries. Similar cases were detected in patients in Hong Kong, Vietnam, and Canada during February and March 2 003. The World Health Organization (WHO) issued a global alert for the illness.  In mid-March 2003,  SARS was recognized in<br>
health care workers and household members who had cared for patients with severe respiratory illness in the far East. Many of these cases could be traced through multiple chains of transmission to a health care worker from Guangdong Province who visited Hong Kong, where he was hospitalized<br>
with pneumonia and died. By late April 2003, over thousands of SARS cases and hundreds of SARS-related deaths were reported to WHO from over 25 countries around the world. Most of these cases occurred after exposure to SARS patients in household or health care settings.<br><br>
Another recent epidemic scare in Asia is the avian influenza virus (H5N1). Avian influenza is an infectious disease of birds caused by type A strains of the influenza virus. There are 15 avian influenza virus subtypes; H5N1 is<br>
of particular concern because it mutates rapidly infecting not just animal, but humans. The confirmed human death cases of avian influenza, as of February 4, 2004, stands at<br>
5  '<br><br>
. thirteen. Laboratories in the WHO global influenza network, . has been working to control the virus and prevent further human deaths. However, to fully understand the magnitude of H5N1 and its ways of distribution, more meticulous testing  is need. Furthermore, antiviral drugs are only effective in treating or preventing influenza A virus strains against those who are of fair health. See http://www.who.int/csr/don/2004_01_15/en, January 15, 2004.<br>
    Researchers at St. Jude and other top influenza laboratories are racing to create a prototype human vaccine against H5N1. They hope that prototype vaccines can be ready in as little as three weeks. Nevertheless, until a vaccine is created, scientists are worried that H5N1 may<br>
     develop into a human superflu. See The Wall Street Journal, Scientists Rush to Create Vaccine for Bird Flu - Just in Case, January 28, 2004.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION <br>
This  invention  provides  a  method  for  producing  a<br>
recombinant super-compound interferon with changed spatial<br>
configuration and enhanced antiviral activity comprising<br>
steps of:<br>
     (a)  Introducing nucleic acid molecule which codes for said<br>
interferon with preferred codons for expression to an<br>
appropriate host; and <br>
(b)  Placing the introduced host in conditions allowing<br>
expression of said interferon. <br>
This invention provides the method for producing interferon, further comprising recovery of the expressed interferon.<br>
This invention provides a recombinant super-compound 30 interferon or an equivalent thereof with changed spatial configuration. This invention reveals that protein with same primary sequence might have different biological activities. As illustrated in the following example, this invention disclosed two proteins with identical amino acid  sequence but with different activities. This activity may sometimes become improved efficacy and sometimes, the protein with changed spatial configuration would reveal new<br>
9<br><br>
function.<br>
An equivalent is a molecule which is similar in function to the compound interferon. An equivalent could be a deletion,<br>
     substitution, or replacement mutant of the original sequence. Alternatively, it is also the intention of this invention to cover mimics of the recombinant super-compound interferon. Mimics could be a peptide, polypeptide or a small chemical entity.<br><br>
The interferon described herein includes but is not limited to interferon a, (3, or co. In an embodiment, it is IFN-la, IFN-2b or other mutants.<br>
     In an embodiment, the super-compound interferon disclosed has higher efficacy than the interferon described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,695,623 or 4,897,471. This super-compound interferon is believed to have unique secondary or tertiary structure. (See e.g. Figure 6)<br><br>
The super-compound interferon described herein has spatial structure change(s) resulting from the changes of its production process.<br>
     The above-described super-compound interferon may be produced by a high efficiency expression system which uses a special promoter. In an embodiment, the promoter is PBAD-As it could be easily appreciated by other ordinary skilled artisan,  other inducible promoters,  such as heat shock<br>
     promoter or heavy metal inducible promoters, may be used in this invention.<br>
The super-compound interferon may also be produced with its gene as artificially synthesized cDNA with adjustment of  its sequence from the wild-type according to codon preference of E. Coli. Extensive discussion of said codon usage  (preference)  may  be  found  in  U.S.  Patent  No.<br>
10<br><br>
4,695,623. See e.g. column 6, line 41 - column 7, line 35<br>
The above described super-compound interferon possesses anti-viral or anti-tumor activity and therefore useful in    inhibiting, preventing and treating viral diseases, tumors or cancers.<br>
As used herein, virus diseases include but are not limited to hepatitis A, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, other types of<br>
     hepatitis, infections caused by Epstein-Barr virus, Cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex viruses, other herpes viruses, papovaviruses, poxviruses, picornaviruses, adenoviruses, rihnoviruses, human T cell leukaemia viruses I, human T cell leukaemia viruses II, or human T cell<br>
     leukemia viruses III.<br>
Viral upper respiratory infection, alternative names common cold, colds. It is a contagious viral infection of the upper respiratory tract characterized by inflammation of<br>
     the mucous membranes, sneezing, and sore throat. It is usually caused by over 200 different viruses, known as rhinoviruses. Colds are not caused by the same viruses responsible for influenza. Colds spread through droplets from the coughing or sneezing of others with a cold or by<br>
     hand contact with objects contaminated by someone with a cold. The incidence of colds is highest among children, and the incidence decreases with age because immunity to the virus causing the cold occurs after the illness. Gradually, immunity to a wide variety of viruses that cause colds is<br>
      developed in adults. Children may have 10 colds a year, and adults may have 3 colds a year.<br>
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has<br>
estimated  that  the  average  annual  incidence  of upper<br>
   respiratory tract infections (URIs) in the United States is<br>
429 million episodes, resulting in more than $2.5 billion<br>
10<br><br>
in direct and indirect healthcare costs.<br>
The common cold is most often caused by one of several hundred rhinoviruses (52%), but coronaviruses (8%) or the  respiratory syncytial virus (7%) may also lead to infection. Other viruses, such as influenza (6%), parainfluenza, and adenoviruses, may produce respiratory symptoms, but these are often associated with pneumonia, fever, or chills.<br>
 Colds occur in a seasonal pattern that usually begins in mid-September and concludes in late April to early May. The common cold is quite contagious and can be transmitted by either person-to-person contact or airborne droplets. Upper respiratory symptoms usually begin 1 to 2 days after<br>
exposure and generally last 1 to 2 weeks, even though viral shedding and contagion can continue for 2 to 3 more weeks. Symptoms may persist with the occurrence of complications such as sinusitis or lower respiratory involvement such as bronchitis or pneumonia.<br>
 The common cold has a variety of overt symptoms, including malaise, nasal stuffiness, rhinorrhea, nonproductive cough, mild sore throat, and, in some cases, a low-grade fever. Because of the similarity of symptoms, a cold may be mistaken for perennial allergic rhinitis, but allergies can<br>
usually be ruled out because of the differences in chronicity.<br>
If a patient presents with a viral URI, the spectrum of remedies is extensive. Since most of these infections are<br>
self-limiting, clinicians usually recommend rest and fluids, but other treatments include environmental and nutritional therapies, over-the-counter and prescription decongestant and  antihistamine  products,   new  antihistamine   and anticholinergic nasal formulations, and antibiotics.  Table<br>

The Usage of Super-compound Interferon to Prevent or Treat URI<br>
Nearly 70~80% URI are caused by viruses such as respiratory Syncytical virus, adenovirus, rhinovirous, cox-sackie virus,<br>
    corona virus and its variant, influenza A virus and its variant, influenza B virus and its variant, parainfluenza virus and its variant, or enterovirus and its variant. A main cause of URI in adults is from rhinovirous. For children,  respiratory syncytical virus and parainfluenza<br>
     virus are two leading causes of URI.<br>
Super-compound interferon plays an important role in the fight  against  virus  that  causes  URI.  Super-compound interferon gains its anti-virus affects mainly via two    mechanisms:<br>
1.	Attach to surface of sensitive cells and induce them<br>
to product anti-virus protein, then blockup the<br>
duplication and reproduce of virus in vivo.<br>
2.	Super-compound interferon can adjust immune response,<br>
          including T cell immune response, activity of NK cell,<br>
the phagocytosis  function of monokaryon,  and even formation of some antibodies in vivo.<br>
In treatment for URI, Super-compound interferon can be directly applied to the affected area via a spray inspiration. This method of treatment allows the interferon to reach the target cells first hand. Consequently, marketing the supply as a spray, rather than via oral or injection, it would be safer and more effective in   administrating the interferon.<br>
The Usage of Super-compound Interferon to Prevent or Treat SARS<br>
With the consent of the Sichuan    working    group    on    SARS 35   prevention and control,   we began the distribution of Super-compound   interferon   on   May   of   2003.   Super-<br>
14<br><br>
compound interferon spray was allocated to doctors and nurses in hospitals, populated areas that where of high risk for SARS, and to the National research group on prevention   and  control   of SARS.   Among the 3000 users as of<br>
    December' 19, 2003, there were no reports of any side effects connected to the use of the spray. Furthermore, none of the doctors and nurses, the people of Sichuan province, or other organizations that have used the Super-compound interferon spray has been infected by SARS.<br><br>
Therefore, this invention provides a method for inhibiting, preventing or treating virus replication or virus infected cells by contacting said virus or infected cells with an effective amount of the super-compound interferon or its<br>
     equivalent.<br>
This super-compound interferon is useful in inhibiting, preventing or treating the following cancers or tumors:<br><br>

It was  surprising to find that rSIFN-co,  the spatial structure  of which has  been  changed,  is  not  only a<br>
18<br><br>
preparation to inhibit the DNA duplication of hepatitis B, but to inhibit the secretion of HBsAg and HBeAg on 2.2.15 cells.<br>
    One objective of this invention is to offer a preparation of rSIFN-co to directly inhibit the DNA duplication of hepatitis B viruses and the secretion of HBeAg and HBsAg of hepatitis B and decrease them to normal levels.<br>
      In one embodiment, rSIFN-co was produced with recombinant techniques. On the condition of fixed amino acid sequence, the IFN DNA was redesigned according to the E. Coli. codon usage and then the rSIFN-co gene was artificially synthesized.  rSIFN-co  cDNA was  cloned  into  the  high-<br>
     expression vector of E.   Coli.   by DNA recombinant techniques, and a high expression of rSIFN-co was gained by using of induce/activate-mechanism of L-arabinose to activate the transcription of PBAD promoter.<br>
      Compared with usual thermo-induction, pH induction and IPTG induction systems of genetic engineering, arabinose induction/activation system has some advantages: (1) Common systems relieve promoter function by creating a "derepression" pattern. Promoters then induce downstream<br>
      gene expression. So temperature and pH change and the addition of IPTG cannot activate promoters directly. In the system disclosed herein, L-arabinose not only deactivates and represses but also activates the transcription of PBAD promoter  which  induce  a  high  expression  of  rSIFN-co.<br>
     Therefore, the arabinose induction/activation system is a more effective expression system. (2) The relation between Exogenous and L-arabinose dosage is linearity. This means the concentration of arabinose can be changed to adjust the expression level of the exogenous gene. Therefore, it is<br>
      easier to control the exogenous gene expression level in E. Coli. by arabinose than by changing temperature and pH value. This characteristic is significant for the formation<br>
10<br><br>
of inclusion bodies. (3) L- arabinose is resourceful cheap and safe, which, on the contrary, are the disadvantages of other inducers such as IPTG.<br>
    This embodiment creates an effective and resistant rSIFN-co-expressing E. Coli. engineering strain with an L-arabinose induction/activation system. The strain is cultivated and fermented under suitable conditions to harvest the bacterial bodies. Inclusion bodies are then<br>
      purified after destroying bacteria and washing repeatedly. The end result, mass of high-purity, spatial-configuration-changed rSIFN-co protein for this invention and for clinical treatment, was gained from denaturation and renaturation of inclusion  bodies  and  a  series  of<br>
     purification steps.<br>
The  following are some rSIFN-co preparations:  tablets,<br>
capsules,  oral  liquids,  pastes,  injections,  sprays,<br>
suppositories, and solutions. Injections are recommended.<br>
     It is common to subcutaneously inject or vein-inject the<br>
medicine.  The medicine carrier could be any acceptance<br>
medicine  carrier,  including  carbohydrate,  cellulosum,<br>
adhesive, collapse, emollient, filling, add-dissolve agent,<br>
amortization, preservative, add-thick agent, matching, etc.<br><br>
This invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition<br>
comprising the above composition and a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable carrier.<br>
     For the purposes of this invention, "pharmaceutically acceptable carriers" means any of the standard pharmaceutical carriers. Examples of suitable carriers are well known in the art and may include, but are not limited to, any of the standard pharmaceutical carriers such as a<br>
     phosphate buffered saline solution and various wetting agents. Other carriers may include additives used in tablets,  granules  and  capsules,  etc.  Typically  such<br>

    produced by QIAGEN Germany Ltd.<br>
At the same time, the pHY-4 plasmid is double digested with Nde I-Xba I. Run 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and purify the 715bp fragment. Ligate the rSIFN-co and pHY-4 fragments with T4 DNA ligase to construct the recombinant plasmid 15 (See Figure 4). Transform DH5acompetent cells with the recombinant plasmid. Spread the transformed cells on LB plate with Amp, 37° C culture overnight.<br>
Positive cloning strain screening<br>
Randomly choose E. Coli. colonies from above LB-plate, 20 screening the positive strains containing recombinant vector by endonuclease digesting and PCR analysis. Name one of the positive recombinant plasmid pHY-5, and name the strain containing pHY-5 plasmid PVIII. Amplify and store the positive strain with glycerol in -80°C. 25<br>
High expression of rSIFN-co gene in E.   Coli.<br>
In pHY-5 plasmid, rSIFN-co gene is under control of strong promoter PBAD- This promoter is positively and negatively regulated by the product of the gene araC. AraC is a 30 transcriptional regulator that forms a complex with arabinose. In the absence of arabinose, the AraC dimer binds 02 and Ii forming a 210bp loop. This conformation<br>
28<br><br>
leads to a complete inhibition of transcription. In the presence of arabinose, the dimer is released from O2 and binds Ii and I2 leading to transcription. Arabinose binding deactivates, represses and even activates the transcription  of PBAD promoter, which stimulates PBAD inducing high expression of rSIFN-co. rSIFN-co expression level in PVIII is more than 50% of the total E.   Coli.  protein.<br>
Summary<br>
RSIFN-CO is a new interferon molecule artificially built  according to the conservative amino acid of human a interferons. It has been proven as a effective anti-hepatitis drug. In order to get enough pure rSIFN-co protein, a stable recombinant E. Coli. strain which high expresses rSIFN-co protein was constructed. <br>
First, according to published rSIFN-co amino acid sequence, E. Coli. codon was used to synthesize whole cDNA of rSIFN-co. This DNA fragment was sequenced and proved that the 501bp codon sequence and TAA termination codon sequence are  valid and identical with theocratic design. Subsequent analysis revealed that the N-terminus amino acid sequence and amino acid composed of rSIFN-co produced by the recombinant strain were both identical to the prediction.<br>
   The rSIFN-co cDNA was cloned into E. Coli. high-expression vector pHY-4 plasmid to construct the recombinant plasmid pHY-5. E. Coli. LMG194 strain was further transformed with pHY-4 plasmid to get stable rSIFN-co high-expression transformant.  This  transformant  was  cultured  for  30<br>
     generations. The heredity of pHY-5 recombinant plasmid in E. Coli.   LMG194 was normal and stable, and the expression of rSIFN-co was high and steady.<br>
E.   Coli.   LMG194, which contains recombinant pHY-5 plasmid,    is actually an ideal high-expression engineering strain.<br>

      overnight. Thaw and break the bacteria by homogenizer, then centrifuge. Wash the pellet with buffer B, buffer C, and distilled water to get a relatively pure inclusion body.<br>
2.	Denaturation and renaturation<br>
     Dissolve the inclusion body in Guanidine-HCl (or urea) of 6 mol/L. The solution will be a little cloudy. Centrifuge it at  a  speed  of  10000  rpm.  Determine  the  protein<br>
32.<br><br>
concentration of the supernatant. This supernatant is called "denaturation solution." Add the denaturation solution to renaturation buffer, and keep the final protein concentration under 0.3 mg/ml. It is better to add the 5 totally denaturation solution in three steps instead of one step. Keep the solution overnight under 4°C. Afterwards, dialyze 10 mol/L,5 mol/L PB buffer and distilled water, then adjust its pH by 2 mol/L HAc-NaAc. Let it stand, then filtrate. 10<br>

     points during testing and compared with data before testing,<br>
the potency began descending from the 6th month and the changes in the three batches were similar. The appearance of other items had no changes.<br>
2)	At 25°C, according to data collected at designated<br>
     points during testing and compared with data before the<br>
testing, the potency only had a little change, and the changes in the three batches were similar. The appearance of other items had no changes.<br>
3). At 2-8°C, according to data collected at designated points during testing and compared with data before testing, the potency of the three batches all were stable. The<br>

Use Sephadex G25 to desalt<br><br>
	Use 0.1 M NaCl to apply CM-Sepharose<br><br>
Stepwise elution to collect the active peak<br><br>
                     After the active peak is desalt, apply to HPLC<br>
	positively charged column<br><br>
Use 0.1 M NaCl to stepwise elution, collect<br>
active peak which is the product of rSIFN-co<br><br>
	Add protection carrier and lyophiling agent<br><br>
Separate lyophilized materials (rSIFN-co)<br>
The purity of the product (rSIFN-co) from this production  procedure is shown to 95% under the test of SDS-PAGE where molecular weight is 14.5 Kda. The reverse phase HPLC shows a single peak and the purity is up to 97%. Its specific activity is up to lxl09 IU/mg protein.<br>
         1.3  Packaging and Inspection<br>
After HPLC purification, 2% human serum albumin, 1% sucrose and 1% glucose were added to the rSIFN-co. It is then separated and lyophilized into injection sample.  When test under the Wish-<br>
	VVS inspection system, the result was 4.5xl08 IU.<br>
When test with aseptic inspection and pyrogen<br>
40<br><br>
inspection under the standard requirement of China, the results are negative. This result complies the IV injection.<br>
2. Quality Control<br>
2.1	Biological characteristics<br>
(1)	When use LB+M9 to cultivate bacteria, the characteristic should match with the typical characteristic of E-coli bacteria. No other bacteria were detected.<br>
(2)	When smeared for Gram staining and watched under microscope, it is bacteria-negative.<br>
(3)	Reaction to antibiotic is the same as those original bacteria.<br>
(4)	Electron microscope ' inspection would show typical characteristic of E-coli bacteria. No mycoplasma, virus spore or other micro pollutes was detected.<br>
(5)	Biochemical reaction test would show characteristics of E-coli bacteria.<br>
2.2	Quality control of interferon expression<br>
(1)	Interferon expression (cultivated in an agitating platform) would match the amount of expression in original input bacteria.<br>
(2)	When test with anti-interferon serum, it shows reaction.<br>
(3)	Plasmid inspection: Restriction digest show match with original plasmid.<br>
2.3	Bacteria strain product<br>
Bacteria strain product denotes the specimen from the original bacteria strain that produced from the procedures show in 1.2.<br>
The inspection of bacteria strain product to make sure no derivation as follows: Use LB plate 2-3 pieces and cultivate. Separate and take 5-10 bacteria  groups  for  the  test  of  interferon<br>
40<br><br>
expression.   Repeat the test at least two (2)<br>
times. Only use the one which shows the highest %<br>
to be the bacteria strain product.<br>
Innoculum<br>
The innoculum denotes the chosen bacteria strain<br>
product  after  fermentation.     The  amount,<br>
cultivation time and most appropriate OD value of<br>
innoculum" can be decided according to different<br>
bacteria  strain.    An  anti-polluted  bacteria<br>
procedure should apply for whatever innoculum<br>
would be produced.<br>
Growing of bacteria strain<br>
Growing " of bacteria strain would be done in a<br>
Bacteria Free room environment where no more than<br>
one bacterium is growing in the same room.  Same<br>
culturing medium will be used for both bacteria<br>
strain and innoculum.  The one would be used in<br>
rSIFN-co is LB.<br>
Fermentation<br>
(1)	The fermentation would only take place in a clean fermentation room with a single bacteria fermentation environment.<br>
(2)	Cleaning of fermentation container and tube would be done twice, before and after the insertion of culturing medium. Then, the container should be frozen to reach the appropriate temperature for innoculum.-<br>
(3)	Avoid using antibiotic which might affect cell growth in the culturing medium.<br>
(4)	Fermentation parameters like temperature, pH value, dissolved oxygen and time required could be varying according to different type of bacterial strain.<br>
Bacteria collection<br>
(1) Centrifuge the bacteria solution to collect bacteria or other method can be used.  All<br>
41<br><br>
apparatus should be cleaned before and after<br>
the operation.  The waste solution would be<br>
drained after a cleaning procedure. <br>
(2)  The bacteria should be kept under 4-8° C if<br>
they are going to be split within 24 hours.<br>
Otherwise, it should be kept under -30° C.<br>
Those are kept under such condition can be<br>
used within 6 months. 2.8 Bacteria cell lysis<br>
(1)	Use appropriate buffer solution to balance the bacteria strain. Cell lysis can be done by physical, chemical or biological methods. Use centrifuge to precipitate the bacteria and apply cleaning solutions.<br>
(2)	If use chemical method to split cells, no harmful solution to human beings should be used..<br>
Purification<br>
(1)	Purification would get rid of most of the non-interferon contents. In the process of purification, no toxic materials should be found if extra elements are added.<br>
(2)	If using antibody affinity chromatography for purification, there would be indication on source and degree of purify. Also, inspection of small quality IgG would be performed.<br>
(3)	During the process of purification, clearance of pyrogen is critical. All apparatus should be checked to eliminate this interference.<br>
(4)	The highly concentrated interferon is known as "intermediate product". After inspection and tests,. would add albumin to raise the concentration to 2% which now known as "albumin  intermediate  product".     After<br>
43<br><br>
examination and tests, it should be kept at<br>
-30° C and never thawed before use.  This<br>
product should be used within 6 months.<br>
(5)  The albumin that used in this process should<br>
	also fulfill the tests and requirements such<br>
as: negative under RBSAG inspection and the ratio among monomer, dimer and polymer should be indicated.<br>
2.10	Production into tube product<br>
	(1)  Filtration: Use 0.22 u membrane to filter<br>
     the bacteria.  The product should be handled with aseptic techniques.   Samples will be taken to test the value of the interferon. <br>
(2)  Dilution:  Dilute the albumin intermediate<br>
	product with 2% diluent.   No preservative<br>
should be added. The product can be lyophilized after the aseptic inspection and pyrogen inspection.<br>
2.11	Lyophilization<br>
	The lyophilization should not affect the activity<br>
of interferon and the water content of said lyophilite will be maintained.<br>
2.12	Inspection<br>
                There are two types of rSIFN-co made.  One is for<br>
	injection and the other for topical use.  The<br>
specifications are different between these two.<br>
There are intermediate product and final product<br>
for each type. Under the injection portion,<br>
intermediate product includes purified interferon,<br>
	albumin intermediate product and bacteria free<br>
albumin intermediate product. Final product under<br>
injection portion will denote only lyophilized<br>
product.  The intermediate product under topical<br>
use portion denotes only purified interferon. The<br>
	final product under topical use portion denotes<br>
               only separated packed liquid formed lyophilized<br>
44<br><br>
products. 2.13 Packaging<br>
              There are different packaging between injection     type and topical use type. <br>
        2.14 Storage<br>
              The  product  should be  kept  in  4°  C.   The<br>
purification solution should not be stored in<br>
frozen.<br>
        2.15 Expiration<br>
	The expiration period is two (2) years after the<br>
               lyophilization procedure for lyophilized products. The  expiration  period  is  6  months  after individual packing for liquidated products.<br>

EXAMPLE 6<br>
Acute Toxicity of rSIFN-co<br>
     Treat mice with large dose (150mg/kg, equal to 1000 times of the normal dose per kilo used in treatment of adult patients) of rSIFN-co at one time by intramuscular injection. Then, observe and record their deaths and toxic reactions. Results show that: 24 hours after injection, no<br>
56<br><br>
abnormal reaction had been recorded. The organs of the animals which had been selected to be killed also had no signs of abnormal changes. Those remaining mice were all kept alive and were normal after two weeks. The weights of<br>
    mice in the experimental group and control group all increased, and the ratio of increase had no obvious difference between the two groups (P&gt;0.05) according to their weights on the fourteenth day. No abnormal changes were seen from the main organs of those mice after two<br>
     weeks.<br>

     40 healthy adult mice, weighing 18-22g, half male and half    female,  qualified by Sichuan experiment animal control center.<br>
2.2	Medicines<br>
rSIFN-co (Provided by Sichuan Huiyang Life-engineering Ltd.) sterilized solution, 0.15 mg/ml, Lot:  981201    rSIFN-co was administered i./n. in saline.<br>
2.	Method<br>
Separate the 40 mice into two groups randomly, one for experimental  medicine,   another  for  control.   Inject<br>
   medicines or saline at the same ratio (0.1 ml/10 g) through<br>
muscle to each mouse according to which group they belong.<br>
(150 ug/kg of rSIFN-co for experimental group; and saline<br>
for control group). After injection, observe and record<br>
acute toxicity shown in mice. Kill half of the mice (male<br>
     and female each half) to check whether there were any abnormal pathologic changes in their main organs, such as heart, spleen, liver, lung, kidney, adrenal gland, stomach, duodenum, etc. after 2 4 hours. Those remains were kept and observed until the fourteenth day. Weigh all mice, kill<br>
     them, and then observe the appearance of the organs listed above to see if there are any abnormalities. Take pathological tissue and examine it, using the examination<br>
57<br><br>
to assess the difference in weight increases in the two groups.<br>
3. Results <br>
 Results show that there was no acute toxicity seen after all mice were treated with i.m. rSIFN-co with 150 ug/kg at a time, equal to 1000 times the normal dose per kilo used in treatment of adult patients. In the 14 days after injection, all mice lived well. They ate, drank, exercised,<br>
    and excreted normally and showed normal hair conditions. . None of them died. The observation of the main organs of the randomly selected mice shows no abnormal changes 24 hours  after  injection.  14  days  after  injection,  all remaining mice were killed.   Autopsies also showed no<br>
     changes. The weights of mice in the two groups all increased, but no obvious difference was shown when accessed with statistic method (p &gt; 0.05). See Table 1:<br>
Table 1 Influence to weights of mice after injection of    rSIFN-co<br>
Group	Dose	Animal	Weightsbeforeinjection(g)	Weightsafterinjection(g)	Increased value of weights(g)<br>
Control	0	20	19.8 ± 1.7	30.8 ± 2.8	11.0 ± 2.9<br>
rSIFN-co	150	20	19.4 ± 1.7	32.1 ± 3.3	12.7 ± 4.3<br>
3. Conclusion<br>
Under conditions of this experiment, there were no toxic reactions in all mice after injection of rSIFN-co with 150  ug/kg. The conclusion can be reached that the maximum tolerable dose of i.m. in mice is 150 ug/kg, which is equal to 1000 times the normal dose per kilo used in treatment of adult patients.<br><br><br>
