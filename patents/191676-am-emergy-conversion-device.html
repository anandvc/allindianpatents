				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an energy conversion<br>
device. Particularly,  it relates to an energy conversion<br>
device employing at least one oscillating resonant converter<br>
producing oscillations, having DC input terminals producing<br>
a control signal and adapted to power at least one gas<br>
discharge lamp having heatable filaments.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
It is common knowledge that application of a series-resonant inverter to power a gas discharge load is particularly ideal in regard to the inverter's matching properties with those of the gas discharge load. Especially, the properties like starting requirements and requirement of the waveform shape of the current supplied to the lamp load, are particularly favorable in respect to life duration of the lamp. (As described in U.S. Patent No. 3,084,283 to Grunwald.)<br>
It is also known that in a series-resonant LC inverter where the lamp load is connected across the resonant capacitor C, it is necessary to provide some means to protect the inverter from self-destruction, whenever the lamp fails to ignite or is removed out of its holders.<br>
Furthermore, as is with all gas discharge lamp ballasts, the voltages required at the lampholders to start the lamps are so high as to potentially constitute a substantial electric shock hazard to persons having to service such ballasts.<br>
To eliminate this hazard, whenever lampholder voltages exceed a certain level, protective measures have to be provided and shall be integrated in the ballast circuit design.<br>
In the paper presented by McMurray, Shattuck entitled "Silicon-Controlled Inverter with Improved Commutation" at the AIEE Summer General Meeting (Ithaca,<br><br>
New York, June 18-23, 1961), the authors described a protection circuit for the series-resonant inverter with use of so-called "feedback rectifiers" to return energy to a DC source. The most important drawback is that the inverter has large magnitude of current circulated within itself, thereby causing large power dissipation.<br>
It will be most desirable to have a series-resonant inverter ballast circuit which (1) will not dissipate any power within itself when unloaded, and (ii) does not constitute a shock hazard to humans.<br>
The circuits for protection of the series-resonant inverters have been described previously, notably in the following issued U.S. Patents: U.S. Patent No. 4,461,980 to Nilssen and U.S. Patent No. 4,616,158 to Krummel et<br>
In the Nilssen circuit, the ballast inverter is disabled within about one second after a lamp is removed from its lampholders, and the ballast, is not taking any power, even though the power line voltage is applied. Whenever a new lamp is reinserted, the power line voltage must be turned Off and On before the ballast will start the new lamp. This is a significant drawback and has not been accepted in the marketplace.<br>
In the Krummel et al. circuit, the shut-off device provides for inverter shut-down in all abnormal load conditions. It also provides for strike of a new lamp after relamping without turning the power line voltage OFF and ON. After construction of the device for a power line voltage of 120 VAC, it has been discovered that the inverter's circulating current is of a large magnitude. The circulating current flows through the lamp filaments and filament voltages are proportional to that current and are also very high.  This drawback is significant and<br><br>
limits the inventions's scope of applications.<br>
Based on the background outlined above, it is highly desirable to have a series-resonant ballast for gas discharge lamps, which: (a) will not draw power from a power line source whenever lamps are removed or inoperative; (b) will strike new lamps after relamping without turning power line voltage OFF and ON; (c) can be adapted to any lamp type and power line voltage magnitude; (d) will be very simple and easily manufacturable with high repeatability; and (e) will be inexpensive. Summary of the Invention<br>
In accordance with the invention, there is provided an energy conversion device employing an oscillating resonant converter having DC input terminals and adapted for powering at least one gas discharge lamp having heatable filaments, and comprising: voltage source means able to provide constant or variable magnitude of a DC voltage between the DC input terminals; output terminals for connection to the filaments of the gas discharge lamp; one-shot trigger means coupled to the DC input terminals and to the resonant converter and (i) able to receive a trigger control signal from the DC input terminals, and (ii) operable to provide one trigger pulse to effectively initiate the oscillations; one-shot disable means coupled to the DC input terminals and to the resonant converter, and (i) able to receive a disable control signal from the resonant converter and (,u.) operable to provide one disable pulse to effectively disable the oscillations; and direct current blocking means coupled to the output terminals and operable to stop flow of the trigger control signal from the DC input terminals.<br><br>
It will be understood that such a device as outlined<br>
above will provide a series-resonant ballast for gas<br>
discharge lamps. The ballast will not draw any power<br>
from a power line source whenever lamps are removed or<br>
inoperative and will ignite new lamps after relamping<br>
without turning power line voltage OFF and ON. The<br>
circuit of the device is simple, inexpensive, and can be<br>
adapted to any lamp type and power line voltage<br>
magnitude.	Accompanying<br>

Then, DC current starts to flow in the direct current path DCP from terminals B+ through resistor 09, filament 12, resistor 18, filament 15, diode 39, resistor 40 to charge the capacitor 42 within the time period of Tl associated with values of the resistors and the capacitor. Whenever the voltage across the capacitor 52 reaches a level above breakover voltage of the diac 44, the diac 44 turns ON the transistor 52. An alternating current will start to flow in the resonant circuit which includes resonant inductor 2 6 and the resonant capacitance 55. With a feedback signal provided by the saturable feedback transformer 53, the device will start to oscillate. The filaments 12 and 15 are heated by current flow resulting from application of voltages by the windings 07 and 24, respectively. A relatively high voltage is developed across both resonant elements. Whenever a magnitude of peak voltage between the nodes 21 and 05 reaches a level of the DC voltage present across the capacitor 46 or 06, the voltage applied to the fluorescent lamp will be proportional to that voltage and is predetermined by a ratio of the values of the capacitors 19 and 20.  The voltage applied to the lamp<br><br>
16 causes the lamp to strike, and voltages across both resonant elements become lower accordingly. During the time period Tl, a DC current will flow in another DC current path from terminal B+ through resistor 09, filament 12, resistor 18, filament 15, diode 34, resistor 3 5 to charge capacitor 3 8 within a time period T2 dependent on. values of the resistors in the path, value of the resistor 37, and value of the capacitor 38. When the voltage across the capacitor reaches a level sufficient enough to turn ON the transistor 43, the capacitor 42 will be held discharged for any time period (i) as long as there is an unbroken direct current path DCP between terminal B+ and terminal CTa and (ii) as long as the device oscillates and charging currents to the capacitors 42 and 4 8 are provided by an AC voltage potential associated with the intermediate terminal 21 in reference to terminal B-.<br>
Mode B While the device is operational, as in Mode A if the fluorescent lamp 16 is removed from its holder, the AC voltage potential associated with the intermediate terminal 27 will rise, as this is a natural behavior of the series-resonant circuit. A current will flow in the third series path of the control circuit 58 from terminal CTa through diode 29, resistor 30, resistor 3 2 to charge capacitor 33 to a voltage level predetermined by values of the resistors in a predetermined time period associated with the value of the capacitor 33. When the voltage across the capacitor 3 3 is greater than breakover voltage of the diac 45, the diac 45 turns ON the transistor 48 for a brief period. As a result, the transistor 48 turns OFF the device and oscillations cease.  The direct current path DCP between terminal B+<br><br>
and terminal CTa is broken due to missing filaments 12,15 of the lamp 16. The DC current will not flow through DC blocking circuits 57,50, and the starting capacitor 42 will not be charged. Thus, the device will never start to oscillate on its own.<br>
Mode C<br>
The fluorescent lamp 16 is now reinserted into its holders that will complete the direct current path DCP between terminal B+ and terminal CTa, and the device will start as in Mode A above.<br>
The above modes of operation all apply to the circuit of FIG. 2 as the alternative versions of the circuit of FIG. 1. The difference is the direct current path DCP is now associated with two lamps 216,217 connected in series. It will be enough to remove only one of the two lamps (as in Mode B) , and the device will be turned OFF by the control circuit 58. Of course, it will be enough to reinsert the one lamp (as in Mode C) to provide for normal start-up and operation of the device..<br>
Also, all above modes of operation apply to the circuit of FIG. 3 as another alternative version of the circuit of FIG. 1. The DC current path DCP between terminal B+ and terminal CTa is here associated with all four filaments 12, 312, 313, and 15 of the two lamps 311,3 06. The filaments are connected in series circuit in the path. It will be enough to remove at least one end of at least one lamp (as in Mode B), and the device will be turned OFF by the control circuit 58. Of course, it will be enough to reinsert that one end of the lamp (as in Mode C) to provide for normal start-up and operation of the device.<br><br>
Operation of the device of FIG. 4:	Mode A<br>
At power up the direct current starts to flow in the direct current path DCP from terminal B+ through filament 412, resistor 418, filament 415, winding 428, resistor 440 to charge capacitor 442. After a predetermined time Tl, when the voltage across capacitor 442 reaches a level high enough to cause the diac 44 4 to breakover, the transistor 452 is turned ON, and the device starts to oscillate. When the transistor 4 52 is turned ON periodically and alternately with the transistor 451, the charge from the capacitor 44 2 is removed with every oscillation cycle through diode 439. Also, the capacitor 438 is charged through a direct current path DCP and the resistor 435 to provide a signal to the base of the transistor 443. After a predetermined time T2, which is longer than Tl, when the voltage across capacitor 43 8 reaches a level sufficient enough to turn ON the transistor 443, the trigger capacitor 442 will be held discharged for any time period as long as (i) there is an unbroken direct current path DCP between terminal B+ and pin terminal P5, and DC voltage is present at all times between terminals B+,B-; (ii) the device oscillating and charging currents to the capacitors 442 and 438 are provided by an AC voltage potential associated with the intermediate terminal 427 in reference to the terminal B-.<br>
The trigger circuit 4 02 arranged as above provides only one trigger pulse per power-up, to initiate the oscillations of the device.<br>
Mode B While the device is operational as in Mode A, when the fluorescent lamp 416 is removed from its holders, voltage  magnitude  across -the  winding  434  rises<br><br>
dramatically, as this is a natural behavior of the series-resonant circuit. The sensing winding 4 34 provides charging current to the capacitor 4 33, and voltage across that capacitor rises. Whenever that voltage reaches a level high enough to breakover the diac 445, the transistor 448 is turned ON for a brief period, and oscillations of the device are stopped. The direct current path DCP between terminal. B-+ is broken due to missing filaments 412, 415 of the lamp 416. The direct current will not flow through DC blocking circuits 457, 460 and the starting capacitor 442 of the trigger circuit 402 will never get charged. Thus, the device will never start to oscillate on its own.<br>
Mode C<br>
The fluorescent lamp 416 is now reinserted into its holder. That will complete the direct current path DCP between terminal B+ and the pin terminal P5 of the trigger circuit 402, and the device will be triggered into oscillation as in Mode A.<br>
The above modes of operation all apply to the circuit of FIG. 5 as the alternative version of the circuit of FIG 4. The difference is that the direct current path DCP is now associated with two lamps 416,516 connected in series. It will be enough to remove only one of the two lamps (as in Mode B), and the oscillations of the device will be stopped by the one-shot disable 401. Of course, it will be enough to reinsert the one lamp (as in Mode C) to provide for normal initiation of the oscillations and operation of the device as in Mode A.<br>
Furthermore, all of the above modes of operation apply to the circuit of FIG. 6 as another alternative version of the circuit of FIG. 4.  The direct current<br><br>
path DCP between terminal B+ and the pin terminal P5 is here associated with all four filaments 412, 512, 515, 415 of the two lamps 416, 516. The filaments are connected in a series circuit path. It will be enough to remove at least one end of at least one lamp (as in Mode B) , and the oscillations of the device will be stopped by a one-shot sensing circuit 4 01. Of course, it will be enough to reinsert the one end of the lamp (as in Mode C) to provide for normal initiation of the oscillations and operation of the device as in Mode A.<br>
Operation of the Device of FIG. 7;	Mode A<br>
At power up, the direct current starts to flow in the direct current path DCP from terminal B+ through internal and external wiring, contact SI, lamp pin terminal 706, contact WS2, contact S3, lamp pin terminal 708, contact S4 and resistor 714 to charge trigger capacitor 718. After a predetermined time Tl, when the voltage across capacitor 718 reaches a level high enough to cause the diac 719 to breakover, the transistor 741 is turned ON, and the device starts to oscillate. When the transistor 741 is turned ON periodically and alternately with the transistor 740, the charge from the capacitor 718 is removed with every oscillation cycle through diode 720. Also, the capacitor 716 is charged through direct current path DCP and the resistor 713 to provide a signal to the base of the transistor 717. After a predetermined time T2, which is longer than Tl, when the voltage across capacitor 716 reaches a level sufficient enough to turn ON the transistor 717, the trigger capacitor 718 will be held discharged for any time period as long as there is an unbroken direct current path DCP between the terminal B+ and the pin terminal PI of the trigger circuit 702, and DC voltage<br><br>
is present at all times between the terminals B+,B-.<br>
The trigger circuit 7 02 arranged as above provides only one relatively short trigger pulse per power-up of the device to effectively initiate the oscillations.<br>
Mode B<br>
While the device is operational as in Mode A, when one of the lamps 704 is removed from its holders, voltage magnitude across winding 727 rises dramatically, as this ia a natural behavior of the series-resonant circuit. The sensing winding 727 provides a charging current to the capacitor 733, and voltage across that capacitor rises. Whenever that voltage reaches a level high enough to breakover the diac 731, the transistor 734 is turned ON for a brief period, and oscillations of the device are stopped. The direct current path DCP, and the trigger capacitor 718 of the trigger circuit 702 will never get charged. Thus, the device will never start to oscillate on its own.<br>
MQfle c<br>
The fluorescent lamp 704 is now reinserted into its holder which will complete the direct current path between terminal B+ and the pin terminal PI of the trigger circuit 702, and the device will be triggered into oscillation as in Mode A.<br>
The circuit of FIG. 1 and all of its alternative variations, equipped with the control circuit and equipped with DC current blocking circuits coupled across at least one filament of at least one lamp provides for an ideally controlled series-resonant ballast for gas discharge lamps.<br>
The control circuits, as described in the present invention, provide superb protection for the ballast in<br><br>
all fault modes such as, for example, starting lamps in very low temperatures, end of lamp life and all behaviors associated with it, power-up with so-called degassed lamps and more.<br>
Furthermore, the circuit of FIG. 4 and all of its alternative variations, equipped with one-shot trigger circuits and one-shot disable circuits, and equipped with DC blocking circuits coupled across at least one filament of at least one lamp, provide for an ideally controlled series-resonant ballast for gas discharge lamps.<br>
The ballast constructed as described above will: (i) not oscillate and will not draw power from a supply voltage source whenever lamps are removed or inoperative; (ii) ignite new lamps after relamping, without turning voltage, source OFF and ON; (iii) can be adapted to any type and any power line voltage magnitude; (iv) will be very simple, easily manufacturable and inexpensive.<br>
It will be understood, however, that all other circuit arrangements, for example, one lamp type device similar to that described in FIG. 7 and equipped with the control circuit of FIG. 1, is another alternative version and is another embodiment of this invention.<br>
It will be further understood that all other types of oscillatory circuits, either self-oscillatory or driven, half-bridge or full-bridge type, fly-back forward, or Class E type, can be equipped with presently described control circuits, one-shot trigger, one-shot disable and DC blocking circuits, and all combinations thereof.<br>
It is believed that the present invention and its; several attendant advantages and features will be understood from the preceding description. However, without departing from the spirit of the invention,<br><br>
