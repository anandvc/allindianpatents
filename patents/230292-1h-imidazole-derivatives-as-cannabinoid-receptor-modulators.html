1H-IMIDAZ0LE DERIVATIVES AS CANNABINOID RECEPTOR MODULATORS<br>
The present invention relates to a group of 1H-imidazole derivatives which are modulators of cannabinoid receptors , to methods for the preparation of these compounds, to novel intermediates useful for the synthesis of said imidazole derivatives, to methods for the preparation of these intermediates, to pharmaceutical compositions containing one or more of these 1H-imidazole derivatives as active ingredient, as well as to the use of these pharmaceutical compositions for the treatment of psychiatric and neurological disorders in which cannabinoid receptors are involved.<br>
The invention also relates to the use of a compound disclosed herein for the manufacture of a medicament giving a beneficial effect. A beneficial effect is disclosed herein or apparent to a person skilled in the art from the specification and general knowledge in the art. The invention also relates to the use of a compound of the invention for the manufacture of a medicament for treating or preventing a disease or condition. More particularly, the invention relates to a new use for the treatment of a disease or condition disclosed herein or apparent to a person skilled in the art from the specification and general knowledge in the art. In embodiments of the invention specific compounds disclosed herein are used for the manufacture of a medicament.<br>
1H-lmidazole derivatives as CB1 receptor modulators are already known from WO 03/027076. However, the compounds described in WO 03/027076 are characterized by a relatively poor aqueous solubility. The goal of the present invention was to improve the aqueous solubility of 1H-imidazole derivatives whilst maintaining their cannabinoid receptor modulating activity. From the prior art it is not obvious how this goal should be achieved.<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that the introduction of a 5-aminomethyl moiety in the 1H-imidazoIe core results in an enhanced aqueous solubility. Moreover, the derivatives containing said 5-aminomethyl moiety retain their cannabinoid receptor modulating activity, such as receptor antagonism, receptor inverse agonismor receptor (partial) agonism. The invention relates to compounds of the general formula (I)<br><br>

Prodrugs are therapeutic agents which are inactive per se but are transformed into one or more active metabolites. Prodrugs are bioreversible derivatives of drug molecules used to overcome some barriers to the utility of the parent drug molecule. These barriers include, but are not limited to, solubility, permeability, stability, presystemic metabolism and targeting limitations (Medicinal Chemistry: Principles and Practice, 1994, ISBN 0-85186-494-5, Ed.: F. D. King, p. 215; J. Stella, "Prodrugs as therapeutics", Expert Opin. Ther. Patents, 14(3), 277-280, 2004; P. Ettmayer et al.,"Lessons learned from marketed and investigational prodrugs", J.Med.Chem., 47, 2393-2404, 2004). Pro-drugs, i.e. compounds which when administered to humans by any known route, are metabolised to compounds having formula (1), belong to the invention. In particular this relates to compounds with primary or secondary amino or hydroxy groups. Such compounds can be reacted with organic acids to yield compounds having formula (1) wherein an additional group is present which is easily removed after administration, for instance, but not limited to ami dine, enamine, a Mannich base, a hydroxyl-methylene derivative, an 0-(acyloxy-methylene carbamate) derivative, carbamate, ester, amide or enaminone.<br>

GENERAL ASPECTS OF SYNTHESES<br>
Compounds of formula (1) and the synthetic intermediates of formula (II) and (VI) respectively may be prepared by a variety of methodologies. The synthesis of structurally related imidazoles as cannabinoid receptor modulators has been described in WO 03/027076 and WO 03/063781. The synthesis of structurally related imidazoles as anti-obesity compounds has also been described in WO 03/040107. The selection of the particular method depends on factors such as the compatibility of functional groups with the reagents used, the possibility to use protecting groups, catalysts, activating and coupling reagents and the ultimate structural features present in the final compound being prepared.

PHARMACOLOGICAL METHODS<br>
In vitro affinity for cannabinoid-CBi receptors .<br>
The affinity of the compounds of the invention for cannabinoid CB t receptors can be determined using membrane preparations of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells in which the human cannabinoid CB1 receptor is stably transfected in conjunction with [3H]CP-55,940 as radioligand. After incubation of a freshly prepared cell membrane preparation with the [3H]-ligand, with or without addition of compounds of the invention, separation of bound and free iigand is performed by filtration over giassfiber filters. Radioactivity on the filter is measured by liquid scintillation counting.<br>
In vitro affinity for cannabinoid-CB2 receptors<br>
The affinity of the compounds of the invention for cannabinoid CB2 receptors can be determined using membrane preparations of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells in which the human cannabinoid CB2 receptor is stably transfected in conjunction with [3H]CP-55,940 as radioligand. After incubation of a freshly prepared cell membrane preparation with the [3H]-ligandl with or without addition of compounds of the invention, separation of bound and free Iigand is performed by filtration over giassfiber filters. Radioactivity on the filter is measured by liquid scintillation counting.<br>
In vitro cannabinoid-CBi receptor antagonism<br>
In vitro CB1receptor antagonism can be assessed with the human CB1 receptor cloned in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. CHO cells are grown in a Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) culture medium, supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. Medium is aspirated and replaced by DMEM, without fetal calf serum, but containing [3H]-arachidonic acid and incubated overnight in a eel I culture stove (5% C02/95% air; 37 °C; water-saturated atmosphere). During this period [3H]-arachidonic acid is incorporated in membrane phospholipids. On the test day, medium is aspirated and ceils are washed three times using 0.5 mL DMEM, containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA). Stimulation of the CB1 receptor by WIN 55,212-2 leads to activation of PLA2 followed by release of [3H]-arachidonic acid into the medium. This WIN 55,212-2-induced release is concentration -dependency antagonized by CB1  receptor antagonists.<br><br>
In vivo cannabinoid-CBi receptor antagonism<br>
In vivo CBi antagonism can be assessed with the CP-55,940-induced hypotension test in rat. Male normotensive rats (225-300 g; Harlan, Horst, The Netherlands) are anaesthetized with pentobarbital (80 mg/kg ip). Blood pressure is measured, via a cannula inserted into the left carotid artery, by means of a Spectramed DTX -plus pressure transducer (Spectramed B.V., Bilthoven, The Netherlands). After amplification by a Nihon Kohden Carrier Amplifier (Type AP-621G; Nihon Kohden B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands), the blood pressure signal is registered on a personal computer (Compaq Deskpro 386s), by means of a Po-Ne-Mah data-acquisition program (Po-Ne-Mah Inc., Storrs, USA). Heart rate is derived from the pulsatile pressure signal. All compounds are administered orally as a microsuspension in 1% methylcellulose 30 minutes before induction of the anesthesia which is 60 minutes prior to administration of the CBi receptor agonist CP-55,940. The injection volume is 10 ml/kg. After haemodynamic stabilization the CB1 receptor agonist CP-55,940 (0.1 mg/kg Lv.) is administered and the hypotensive effect established. (Wagner, J. A.; Jarai, Z.; Batkai, S.; Kunos, G. Hemodynamic effects of cannabinoids: coronary and cerebral vasodilation mediated by cannabinoid CB1 receptors. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2001,423, 203-210); Lange, J. H. M. et al, J. Med. Chem. 2004,47,627-643.<br>
In vivo cannabinoid-CBt receptor (partial) agonistic activity<br>
Cannabinoid receptor agonistic or partial agonistic activity of compounds of the invention can be determined according to published methods, such as assessment of in vivo cannabimimetic effects (Wiley, J. L et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001, 296,1013).<br>
DETERMINATION OF AQUEOUS SOLUBILITY<br>
The compounds are dissolved in DMSO to give 10 mg/ml stock solutions. These stock solutions are divided over several plates. Several diluted concentrations are made with DMSO to 5, 2.5, 1.25, 0.625 and 0.3125 mg/ml, respectively. The stock solution and each derived concentration from this stock solution is taken and diluted 100 fold with water or with water containing a buffer. In every case this gives an aqueous solution which contains 1 % DMSO (v/v) and 100, 50, 25,12.5 and 6.25 and<br><br>
3.125 µg  compound/ml, respectively. The formation of a precipitate is determined in each plate. The measurements were performed at pH= 7, applying a HEPES buffer and at pH= 2, applying hydrochloric acid. Aqueous solubility is expressed inµg/ml in the table below.<br>
The specific compounds of which the synthesis is described below are intended to further illustrate the invention in more detail, and therefore are not deemed to restrict the scope of the invention in any way.<br>
EXAMPLE 1; SYNTHESES OF SPECIFIC COMPOUNDS<br>
Synthesis of compound 1<br>
Part A: Ethyl 5-bromomethyM -(4-chlorophenyl)-2-(2,4-dichlorophenyI)-1 H-imidazole-4-carboxylate. To a magnetically stirred mixture of ethyl 1-(4-chlorophenyI)-2-(2,4-dichlorophenyI)-5-methyl-1 H-imidazoIe-4-carboxylate (2.05 g, 5.00 mmol) in CCI4 (25 mL) was added N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) (1.34 g, 7.53 mmol) and dibenzoyl peroxide (10.0 mg, assay 75%, 0.0310 mmol) and the resulting mixture was refluxed for 38 h. The formed precipitate was removed by filtration. The filtrate was successively washed with brine and water, dried over MgSO4, filtered and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified by flash chromatography (CH2CI2/acetone = 98/2 (v/v)) to give ethyl 5-bromomethyl-1-(4-chIorophenyl)-2-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-1H-imidazole-4-carboxylate (1.29 g, 53 % yield) as an amorphous solid, 1H-NMR (200 MHz, CDCI3): .8 1.45 { J = 7 Hz, 3H), 4.48 (q, J = 7 Hz, 2H), 4.72 (s,2H), 7.18-7.43 (m,7H).<br>
Part B: To a magnetically stirred solution of ethyl 5-bromomethyl-1-(4-chIorophenyl)-2-(2,4-dichlorophenyI)-1 H«imidazole-4-carboxylate (11.69 g, 23.9 mmol) in acetonitrile (40 ml) is added diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) (5.2 ml, 30 mmol) and pyrrolidine (1.7 g, 23.9 mmol) and the resulting solution is reacted at room temperature for 2 hours. Water (250 ml) is added and the resulting mixture is extracted three times with dichloromethane. The collected dichloromethane layers are dried over Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated in vacuo. Subsequent purification with flash chromatography (petroleum ether/EtOAc = 20/80 (v/v)) gives ethyl 1-(4-chlorophenyl)-2-(2,4-dichloro-phenyI)-5Kpyn"oIidin-1-ylmethyl)-1H-imidazole^-carboxylate (3.7 gram, 32 % yield). 1H-NMR (200 MHz, CDCl3): 81.42 (t, J = 7 Hz,<br><br>

Part C: Cyclohexylamine (0.91 ml, 8 mmol) is dissolved in dichloromethane (20 ml) and (CH3)3AI (4 ml of a 2 M solution in heptane, 8 mmol) is added. The resulting mixture is stirred for 10 minutes at room temperature and ethyl 1-(4-chlorophenyI)-2-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-5-(pyrrolidin-1-ylmethyl)-1H-imidazole4-carboxyIate (1.8 gram , 3.8 mmol) is added. The resulting mixture is stirred at room temperature for 16 hours, poured into an aqueous NaHCO3 solution, stirred for 30 minutes and filtered over hyflo. The filtrated is twice extracted with dichloromethane. The organic layers are dried over Na2S04, filtered and concentrated in vacuo. Subsequent purification with flash chromatography (dichloromethane/methanol = 98/2 (v/v)) gives N-cyclohexyI-1-(4-chlorophenyl)-2-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-5-(pyrrolidin-1-ylmethyl)-1H-imidazole-4-carboxamide, compound 1 (1.06 gram, 53 % yield).
