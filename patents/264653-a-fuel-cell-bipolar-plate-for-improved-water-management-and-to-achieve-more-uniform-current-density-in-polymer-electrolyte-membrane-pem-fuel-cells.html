				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a fuel cell bipolar plate having multiple entry and single<br>
exit flow field network for reactant gas flow adaptable to polymer electrolyte membrane<br>
fuel cells (PEMFC) and phosphoric acid fuel cells (PAFC) and a process of functioning<br>
thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A fuel cell is an electrochemical device wherein a fuel gas reacts electrochemically with<br>
an oxidant gas in the presence of a catalyst, producing electricity. When operated with<br>
hydrogen as fuel and oxygen as oxidant, the operation of an "acidic" fuel cell, at the<br>
atomic level, may be understood as-stripping off of electrons from the "hydrogen" at<br>
the catalyst sites at anode, the "ionized hydrogen", known as a proton, travelling to the<br>
cathode through the "electrolyte" medium and recombining with "oxygen" which is<br>
supplied to the cathode and the "electrons" which reach the cathode through the<br>
external "load" circuit, to produce water.<br>
Several different types of fuel cells have been developed. They are generally known by<br>
the name of the "electrolyte" used in them, like Alkaline Fuel Cells (which use KOH, an<br>
alkali as an electrolyte), Phosphoric Acid Fuel Cells, Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel<br>
Cells, also known as Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells or even as Solid Polymer<br>
Electrolyte Fuel Cells.<br>
Fuel cells are being considered for various potential applications as portable power units<br>
and for providing clean power in transport and telecommunication applications.<br>
Stationery applications for powering homes, school buildings, hospitals, hotels, office<br>
buildings, are also becoming increasingly viable.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore, an object of the present invention to propose a fuel cell bipolar plate<br>
having multiple entry and single exit flow field network for reactant gas flow adaptable<br>
to polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) and phosphoric acid fuel cells<br>
(PAFC) and a process of functioning thereof which eliminates the disadvantages of<br>
existing state of art bipolar plates.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to propose fuel cell bipolar plates having<br>
multiple entry and single exit flow field network for reactant gas flow adaptable to<br>
polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) and phosphoric acid fuel cells (PAFC)<br>
and a process of functioning thereof which ensures availability of required amount of<br>
fuel gases to enter through multiple entries and pass through a unique flow pattern<br><br>
network covering the entire area of the electrodes. This is achieved by means of an<br>
inventive step whereby multiple streams of gases merge into a single stream towards<br>
the exit end of the flow field network thus making available more amounts of gases<br>
especially in those area where starvation of gases would have been felt as the original<br>
amounts of gases would have got consumed to a large extent by then.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to propose fuel cell bipolar plates having<br>
multiple entry and single exit flow field network for reactant gas flow adaptable to<br>
polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) and phosphoric acid fuel cells (PAFC)<br>
and a process of functioning thereof which ensures a uniform flow of fuel gases to the<br>
electrodes.<br>
An yet further object of the present invention is to propose fuel cell bipolar plates<br>
having multiple entry and single exit flow field network for reactant gas flow adaptable<br>
to polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) and phosphoric acid fuel cells<br>
(PAFC) and a process of functioning thereof which helps maintain a more uniform<br>
current density throughout the entire electrode area with almost 100% fuel utilization.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In order to maintain a reasonably high current density through out the cell area without<br>
having to supply excess hydrogen, thereby reducing to minimum the venting of<br><br>
hydrogen at the exit with consequential improvement in hydrogen utilization has been<br>
substantially resolved by developing a "multiple entry=single exit" type of flow pattern.<br>
The present invention relates, specifically to the Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel<br>
Cells (PEMFC), but can also be used for other types of Fuel Cells like the Phosphoric<br>
Acid Fuel Cells.<br>
In the case of PEMFC, H2 fuel, supplied to the Anode, sheds one electron and becomes<br>
H+ ion. This H+ ion or 'proton' travels to the cathode through the 'proton conducting<br>
membrane'. The electrons (e-), shed by H2 at the anode, travel through the external<br>
'load' up to the cathode, thus completing the electrical circuit and recombine with the<br>
proton and oxygen. The H+, O2 and e" combine with each other at cathode, to yield<br>
product "Water". Since the above process is "exothermic" in nature, some heat is also<br>
produced. "Water" and "Heat", therefore, are the only by-products of a typical fuel cell<br>
reaction, making them one of the cleanest "electricity" generating systems.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE<br>
INVENTION<br>
The simplest form of fuel cell bipolar plates having a multiple entry single exit<br>
construction is a dual entry single exit flow field pattern which is used for the following<br>
description:<br>
A typical fuel cell bipolar plate comprises not only of the flow fields but also contains<br>
certain other areas which are used for accommodating tie rods, internal manifolds etc,,<br>
certain portions of these surroundings are also used for placing electrode edge seals or<br>
gaskets to avoid leakage of the fuel stream into the oxidant stream or vice versa and<br>
also to avoid their leakage into the surrounding areas.<br><br>
Figure 1 shows a plan view of a typical fuel cell bipolar plate (6) showing the core<br>
region where the gas flow fields are contained and the surrounding region which<br>
accommodates tie rods (3), internal gas manifolds (4) and electrode edge seals (5) etc.<br>
As can be seen in Figure 1, the rectangular pockets (4) are known as internal gas<br>
manifolds from where the reactant gases enter into the corresponding grooves (1) in<br>
the bipolar plates (6). It can be seen that out of the six rectangular pockets contained<br>
in the bipolar plate, only 3 have been used for one type of reactant gas in first row. In<br>
this case, the two pockets shown on the left side are used as entrances (1, 1) and the<br>
one shown on right side becomes the exit port (2). A typical bipolar plate (6) contains<br>
grooves on its reverse side also through which the other reactant gas flows. The three<br>
remaining pockets are connected to similar groove pattern on the other side, the two<br>
on right becoming the entrances and the one shown on left becoming the exit port for<br>
other reactant gas.<br>
The sealing of the areas (5) surrounding these rectangular pockets (4) with flexible<br>
seals like silicone rubber etc., allows the two different gases to flow from their<br>
respective pockets to the grooves which emanate from these respective pockets without<br>
intermixing or leaking out into the surrounding environment.<br>
As shown in Fig.4, a plurality of such bipolar plates are stacked one over another with<br>
Membrane Electrode Assemblies (MEAs) or single cells placed between each such pair<br>
of bipolar plates in such a manner that all the rectangular pockets are so aligned as 10<br>
form a rectangular pipe, thereby becoming the internal manifold. The plurality of such<br>
bipolar plates and MEAs are clamped together using a pair of top and bottom steel<br><br>
plates which are electrically insulated from the bi-polar plates and MEAs by a pair of<br>
suitable insulating plates. The overall assembly is fastened by means of a plurality of tie<br>
rods which pass through the corresponding round holes (3) provided all along the four<br>
sides of the rectangular plate. The first layer pipe manifold (22) from the top wherein a<br>
first reactant gas takes entry from gas entry port (1) at front end and the second layer<br>
of pipe manifold (23) is engaged for a second reactant gas which takes entry in gas<br>
entry port (1) at rear end. In between the two layers of pipe manifold, a membrane<br>
electrode assembly member (24) is disposed. The reactant gas entering through the<br>
rectangular inlet manifold (22) exits through the rectangular outlet manifold (25).<br>
Similarly the other reactant gas which enters through the rectangular inlet manifold<br>
(23) exits through the outlet manifold (26), as shown in Fig.4.<br>
Fig.5 shows the arrangement of bi-polar plates, membrane electrode assemblies,<br>
insulating plates, steel clamping plates and tie rods in a typical fuel cell stack,<br>
containing 5 cells.<br>
In the flow field design shown in Fig.l, both the entry points (1) for one of the reactant<br>
gases have been positioned on the left side edge of the bipolar plate (6), one entrance<br>
being on the top and the other being at the bottom. The exit point (2) has been<br>
positioned exactly halfway away from both the entry points, but on the opposite edge<br>
i.e. in the middle portion on the right hand side edge of the bipolar plate.<br>
Figure 2 shows the details of one of the entry ports (1). It can be seen that the reactant<br>
gas contained in the rectangular internal manifold on the left side edge of the bipolar<br>
plate enters and flows to the right hand side edge through 4 parallel grooves<br><br>
(10,11/12,13), all of which terminate into a relatively wider canal (14). Through another<br>
set of 6 grooves emanating from this wide (shorter) canal (14), the reactant gas starts<br>
ifs journey in the opposite direction. This wider canal (14) serves as a mini storage3 of<br>
reactant gas and supplies the same to the next set of 6 parallel grooves. In addition to<br>
this, the wider canal (14) also serves another important purpose. Since water is the by-<br>
product of the reaction; some of the produced water tends to move towards the flow<br>
field in the form of droplets (7). This becomes an unwanted phenomenon since the<br>
water droplets (7) squeeze or in some cases completely block the flow path. Once a<br>
droplet comes in the way of the flowing gas in a particular groove (11) the remaining<br>
portion of the groove would suffer from starvation (9). This aspect has been effectively<br>
taken care of in this special design. Since the wider canal (14) also acts as a mini<br>
reservoir of reactant gases, the moment a particular groove (11) gets blocked with a<br>
condensed water droplet (7), gases from the wider canal (14) immediately fill the<br>
starved zone of the groove (11) from the wide canal (14), the gas flowing in the<br>
reverse direction (8) as shown in Fig.2.<br>
The second set of six parallel grooves too terminate into yet another wide canal (21)<br>
which has the same width as the earlier canal but is slightly longer to allow the grooves<br>
coming from the second entrance also to terminate in it so that double the amount of<br>
reactant gas is now available to flow through the last 4 channels leading to the exit<br>
port, as can be seen in Figure 3.<br>
This unique positioning of entry (1) and exit (2) ports makes a particular gas to travel<br>
only about half the path which it would have otherwise travelled in the case of single<br><br>
entry and single exit flow pattern. This reduction in path length reduces the pressure<br>
drop which the reactant gas encounters making it possible to supply the gas at a lower<br>
pressure.<br>
In the present case the flow pattern has been constituted in such a way that once the<br>
gas enters the flow field, it only travels a short distance through a set of grooves before<br>
the gas terminates into a relatively wide canal. This canal serves as a mini reservoir of<br>
the reactant gas to meet instantaneous higher demand of the reactant due to sudden<br>
load change. The canal also acts as a trap for water droplets which may be present<br>
either due to condensation of water from the humidified reactants or the condensation<br>
of product water itself, especially at low temperature of operation of the PEM Fuel Cell<br>
stack, say, below about 50°C.<br>
In the case of Phosphoric Acid Fuel cells, water condensation does not pose any<br>
problem because the temperature of operation of a typical PAFC stack is in the range of<br>
150°C to 210°C, thereby allowing the water to escape as steam.<br>
The provision of intermediate canals has yet another advantage. The canal makes it<br>
possible to supply reactant gas to even those portions of the grooves which sometimes<br>
become inaccessible to the reactant gas due to a block created by a condensed droplet<br>
of water. In the present flow field pattern, even the starved downstream portion of<br>
such grooves, has an access to the reactant gas from the canal on the opposite end.<br>
The dimensions of the grooves are fixed in such a way that the minimum amount of gas<br>
available at any instant inside the bipolar plate is equal to or just a little more than the<br>
required amount of gas for drawing the desired current. The presence of wide canals<br><br>
results in reducing the pressure drop which would have otherwise occurred during<br>
change of direction of flow of the reactant gas.<br>
Apart from providing a unique pattern for gases to flow, in the effective area of the<br>
cells, the bipolar plate design also ensures that the circular holes for tie rod and<br>
rectangular pockets for gas manifolds are evenly placed, along the periphery such that<br>
the minimum clearance between the edge of the plate and beginning of any hole or<br>
pocket is sufficient for the edge seal to avoid any intermixing or leakage.<br><br>
