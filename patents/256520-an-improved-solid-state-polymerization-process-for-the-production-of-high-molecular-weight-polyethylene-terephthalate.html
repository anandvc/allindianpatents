3. PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br>
TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
This invention relates to an improved solid-state polymerization process for the production of high molecular weight polyester resin comprising neopentyl glycol and / or 2-methyl -1,3-propanediol or such diols containing tertiary or quaternary carbon atoms with pendant groups suitable for the production of containers, films and industrial yarn applications.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
PET resins are well known for making films, fibers and packaged container applications. Generally, two major and distinct process steps are involved in the production of high molecular weight polyesters. These two steps include melt polymerization and solid-state polymerization (SSP).<br>
In the polymerization process for producing polyester having high intrinsic viscosity (IV), base prepolymer of IV of about 0.4 dl/g to about 0.65 dl/g is produced by melt polymerization process. These base chips are cylindrical or spherical in shape. Base chip of prepolymer polyester is amorphous in nature. Base prepolymer is then subjected to solid-state polymerization after crystallizing it in a crystallizer so as to avoid sintering or lump formation in the SSP reactor. Using SSP process, depending on the application, different IV resin can be produced. Conventional polyester polymerization processes are disclosed in US 3,405,098; US 3,544,525; US 4,245,253; US 4,238,593; and US 5,408,035.<br>
For producing transparent polyester articles such as preforms and containers, traditionally small amount of isophthalic acid is being used. Preferably less than 10 wt% of isophthalic acid is required for producing haze free products. Apart from isophthalic acid, use of cyclohexanedimethanol, neopentyl glycol or 2-methyl-1,3 propanediol is also recorded.<br><br><br>
In the prior art, PET was modified to minimize crystallization rate during parison molding and blow molding, by adding a small quantity of isophthalic acid (IPA) together with terephthalic acid as dicarboxylic acid component of PET, or cyclohexanedimethanol (CHDM) or neopentyl glycol together with ethylene glycol as glycol component of PET, thus producing copolymeric PET having a slow crystallizing rate by conventional copolymerization (Lecture abstracts of the 11th Colloquium on Structure and Physical Properties of High Polymers, held by the Japanese High Polymer Society, Kanto Branch, on June 16, 1981, "Recent Progress in Modification of Polymers" p.3.). These co-monomers are preferably added at the stage of polymerization.<br>
A US patent 4,415,727 describes the use of 2-methyl-1, 3 propanediol for the production of PET bottles for packaging applications.<br>
A Japanese patent 2006274239 discloses the moulding components for producing dust boxes, pylons, flower vases, stools, lighting shades, umbrella stands, and powder packaging containers. Various comonomers selected from isophthalic acid, 2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid, diethylene glycol, neopentyl glycol, 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol, 1,2-propanediol, 1,3-propanediol, and/or 2-methyl-1,3-propanediol were suggested.<br>
A Japanese patent JP 2003064167 discloses the use of 2-methyl-1,3 propanediol and cyclohexanedimethanol for improving transparency, impact and heat resistance of moulded polyester products.<br>
A Japanese patent JP 2002275252 describes the di-Me 2,6-naphthalate-ethylene glycol-2-methyl-1,3-propanediol copolymer for producing bottles for packaging applications.<br><br><br>
WO 2002042354 explains the production of unsatd. terephthalate-based polyester resins (UPR) based on 2-methyl-1,3-propanediol without use of a catalyst in reasonable cycle times..<br>
A European patent application EP 984086 assigned to M/s Dairen Chemical Corporation for the manufacture of polyester fibers containing 2-methyl-1,3-propanediol units in the molecular chain with improved dyeability and low elongation and high tensile strength.<br>
A French patent FR 2004619 discloses the use of neopentyl glycol along with 2-methyl-1,3-propanediol during polyester polymerization for producing transparent polyester articles.<br>
None of these patents discloses the solid-state polymerization process and reactivity gain in the SSP process using neopentyl glycol and 2-methyl-1, 3 propanediol. It was surprisingly found that neopentyl glycol or 2-methyl-1, 3 propanediol, increases solid-state polymerization rate.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION:<br>
An object of the invention is to provide an improved solid-state polymerization process for the production of high molecular weight polyester prepolymer having IV of 0.5 dl/g to 1.2 dl/g produced from low molecular weight polyester prepolymer having IV of 0.4 dl/g to 0.65 dl/g comprising the co-monomer, neopentyl glycol and / or 2-methyl -1,3-propanediol along with conventional monomers.<br>

The oligomer obtained was then subjected to polycondensation in the presence pf 25 ppm of cobalt as Cobalt acetate and 25 ppm of phosphorous as phosphoric acid at temperature of 285°C to obtain a prepolymer having IV up to 0.6 dl/g. After achieving the desired prepolymer IV, it was drained and cut in a granular form for further processing. The granulated prepolymer was amorphous in nature. This prepolymer was considered as "Control".<br><br><br>
Example 9: Comparative<br>
PET prepolymer of IV of 0.60 dl/g was prepared a batch reactor by melt-phase polymerization process. Purified terephthalic acid and monoethylene glycol (MEG) were charged in 1:2 ratio in reactor. 1.3 wt % Isophthalic acid was also added along with PTA.. Esterification reaction was carried out at 255°C. The oligomer obtained was then subjected to polycondensation in the presence pf 25 ppm of cobalt as Cobalt acetate and 25 ppm of phosphorous as phosphoric acid at temperature of 285°C to obtain a prepolymer having IV up to 0.6 dl/g. After achieving the desired prepolymer IV, it was drained and cut in a granular form for further processing. The granulated prepolymer was amorphous in nature. This prepolymer was considered as "Control".<br>
Example 10:<br>
Solid state polymerization<br>
Prepolymer having IV of 0.6 dl/g obtained in the example 1 to 9 was solid-state polymerized under an inert atmosphere to raise the IV up to 1 dl/g. Solid - state polymerization was carried out in a batch reactor. Nitrogen gas temperature for solid-state polymerization was 205°C and target SSP exit IV was 0.76± 0.02 dl/g. The solid-state polymerization reaction rates in terms of IV rise per hour are given in the table 1.<br>
TABLE 1<br><br>
Example No.	Prepolymer IV (dl/g)	Final IV (dl/g)	SSP residence time (Hrs)	IV rise (dl/g) / hour<br>
1	0.601	0.755	7	0.022<br>
2	0.606	0.769	7	0.023<br>
3	0.603	0.766	7	0.023<br>
4	0.599	0.781	6	0.030<br>
5	0.610	0.772	7	0.023<br>
6	0.607	0.762	7	0.022<br>
7	0.606	0.753	7	0.021<br>
8	0.607	0.742	8	0.017<br>
9	0.604	0.777	9	0.019<br><br><br>
Results of Table 1 indicates the faster solid-state reaction rate with neopentyl glycol and 2-methyl-1,3 propanediol as compared to isophthalic acid.<br>
According to the present invention, haze free performs was obtained due to the addition of neopentyl glycol and 2-methyl-1,3 propanediol<br>
Bottles of 1.5 L volume were produced using SIDEL SB01 single cavity blow moulding machine. Performance of the bottles produced with neopentyl glycol and 2-methyl-1,3 propanediol was comparable to the bottles produced with isophthalic acid.<br><br></td>
