				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to s process for the production of ferrous<br>
based composite materials.<br>
This invention further relates to a process for the preparation<br>
of TiC reinforced ferrous based composite materials from<br>
industrial waste.<br>
The need for long—lasting component has led to the development of<br>
wear resistant materials. Iron matrix composites have gained<br>
attention essentially as potential wear resistant materials. As<br>
engineering materials, iron and steel are yet to be displaced<br>
from the top slot by the range of polymers/ceramics and other<br>
metals in terms of volume of consumption because of their versa-<br>
tility and low cost. Achievement of the improved wear resistance<br>
by ceramic particle reinforcement is possible and has been<br>
proved. However, it is the economy of producing the composite<br>
that will decide whether it would be able to compete with the<br>
wide range of steels/alloy steels/alloy irons already available<br>
in the market. As there is a constant search for novel and econo-<br>
mical synthesis routes, the various routes of synthesis of Fe-<br>
Tic composite has been evolving over the years gradually. Several<br>
processes are available for the synthesis of these kind of TiC<br>
reinforced ferrous based composites, namely powder metallurgy<br>
technique, carbothermic reduction of ilmenite or rutile in<br>
presence of iron.<br>
Most of the iron-based composites are produced by powder metal-<br>
lurgical route and reinforced with TiC. This product is marketed<br>
under the trade name FERROTIC, TIC ALLOY, FERROTITANIT. The<br>
correlation between microstructure and mechanical properties of<br>
TiC reinforced white iron matrix; composites and hot work tool<br>
steel matrix composites produced by hot isostatic pressing has<br>
been studied. Further, a microstructure development and sintering<br>
kinetics of high-speed steel based composites re-informed with<br>
either TiC or NbC and ball milling assisted low temperature<br>
formation of Fe—TiC composite from ilmenite-csrbon mixture have<br>
also been studied.<br>
The production of composite via powder metallurgy route has its<br>
limitations, eg. mixing of matrix powder and reinforcing particle<br>
must be through in order to achieve uniform dispersion of rein-<br>
forcing phase. Sintering cycle and environment must be chosen<br>
critically to obtain components with near theoretical density,<br>
difficulty af machining or trimming sintered parts because of<br>
high hardness of the materials. One then looks to the other<br>
common route, eg.casting route.<br>
Ceramic particles in metals and alloy were assumed as undesirable<br>
inclusion in past. In the mid-sixties, nickel coated graphite<br>
powders were incorporated in aluminum alloys by injecting the<br>
powders together with argon gas into a molten bath of the alloy<br>
and this marked the beginning of cast metal -- matrix particulate<br>
composites (MMPC). This was followed by specific techniques to<br>
generate cast composites..<br>
The dispersion of TiC in liquid iron alloy was studied and a<br>
qualitative assessment of the condition of dispersion was<br>
established. Terry et al have also tried to develop in—situ Fe —<br>
TiC composite by reaction in liquid iron alloys. In an attempt to<br>
develop Fe-TiC reinforced cast composites through a novel rout;<br>
Galgali et al worked extensively on the production and charac-<br>
terisation of TiC reinforced Fe based composite. The TiC rein-<br>
forced iron based composites were produced by direct carbothermic<br>
reduction of ilmenite ore in a bed of steel scrap contained in a<br>
plasma reactor. Galgali has also produced TiC reinforced steel-<br>
based composite. The TiC reinforced iron based composites cere<br>
produced by direct carbothermic reduction of illmenite ore in a<br>
bed of steel scrap contained in a plasma reactor. Galgali has<br>
also produced TiC reinforced steel—based composites by dissolving<br>
Fe-TiC rich master alloy in liquid steel. This approach was<br>
followed since carbothermic reduction of ilmenite in a graphite<br>
crucible does not permit the preparation of TiC reinforced steel of<br>
based composites by a single smelting operation due to the<br>
inevitable pick up of carbon. However, difficulty arises due to<br>
loss of Ti by oxidation before incorporation into the melt.<br>
However, the need exists to provide more economical synthefi-<br>
routes involving high energy efficiency and low cost oron<br>
production.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore en object of this invention to propose a process<br>
for the production of ferrous based composite materials from<br>
industrial wastes which involves in-situ generation of titanium<br>
carbide particles.<br>
It is a further object of this invention to propose a process for<br>
the production of ferrous based composite materials from indus-<br>
trial wastes which is simple, energy efficient and is therefore<br>
economic a 1 .<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Thus according to this invention is provided a process for the<br>
preparation of ferrous based composite comprising subjecting<br>
industrial waste material to the step of alumino thermic reduc-<br>
tion in the presence of cabron.<br>
In accordance with this invention, the charge needed to synthe-<br>
size the composite consists of siliceous sand, aluminum powder<br>
(stoichiometric amount) and C in the form of cast iron and/or<br>
graphite. The charge is preheated in a pit furnace in a clay<br>
graphite crucible. The crucibles are coated with zircon paint to<br>
prevent carbon pick up. The crucible is removed out of the<br>
furnace when requisite temperature is reached and then the reac-<br>
tion is triggered by adding magnesium turnings. The heat gene-<br>
rated due to aluminothermic reaction is high enough to melt the<br>
charge completely and uniformly. A bottom pouring arrangement is<br>
made so that the liquid metal can be poured directly into a mould<br>
by opening the plug at the bottom of the crucible.<br>
Siliceous sand which is a waste product of the aluminium extrac-<br>
tion plant is a source of Fe2o3 and TiO2. A typical sand<br><br>
composition comprises, for example, 73.1'/.Fe2o3 , 6.26'/. Al2o3 ,<br><br>
3.63X TiO2 , 2.5'A Na2O and 3.84% SiO2 by weight with other<br><br>
impurities, like NiO, Cr2 O3 and V2 O5 to make up the balance. The<br><br>
sand is rich in Fe2O3 and also contains a substantial amount of<br><br>
TiO2 .<br><br>
A typical micrograph of the cast composite is shown in Fig.l of<br>
the accompanying drawings.<br>
Composites produced by this method show impressive wear resis-<br>
tance and thus can find application as wear resistance materials.<br>
The wear resistance property of the composite is better than some<br>
commercially available tool steels and it has the potential as<br>
ambient temperature tool material. This is depicted in Fig.2<br>
which shows the cumulative weight loss in wear of as cast compo-<br>
sites of varying carbon content in steel matrix (designated as<br>
(a&gt;, (b) and <c>&gt; and tool steel material. The wear parameters<br>
are :<br>
(a) Abrasive medium -220 grit SiC paper; (b) Normal load -10.90N;<br>
-1<br>
(c) Sliding speed-1.25 ms<br>
The hardness data of as cast composites is shown in T«ble I,<br>
where materials (a), (b) and (C) are composites of varying carbon<br>
content in steel matrix.<br>
The main advantage of producing Fe based composite via alumino-<br>
thermic reduction is the simplicity of the method by which the<br>
composite can be produced. The heat evolved during aluminothermic:<br>
reduction will melt the charge. Therefore, no expensive experi-<br>
mental set up but only some cheap raw materials are needed to<br>
synthesize the composite- As a result, even a small scale foundry<br>
can produce Fe based composite with improvement in properties<br>
over conventional steel/cast iron castings.<br>
The Fi-TiC composite made via aluminothermic reduction of sili-<br>
ceous sand in presence of carbon has shown very good wear resis-<br>
tance properties. The present study assumes greater significance<br>
in the light of the fact that 'discard' by product is the main<br>
raw material. The composite produced via this method has the<br>
potential of replacing some of the expensive tool materials. The<br>
statement is justified not only due to the properties they<br>
exhibit but also owing to the ease of synthesis and the economy<br>
of the process.<br>
