Method and apparatus for pulling off and drawing a multifilament thread<br>
The invention relates to a method for pulling off and drawing a multifilament thread during melt spinning, according to the preamble of claim 1,  and to an apparatus for carrying out the method, accordi-ng to the preamble of claim 10.<br>
In the production of multifilament threads in a melt-spinning process, it is known to pull the freshly-spun multifilament threads out of the spinning device and, depending on the type of thread, toearry out a greater or lesser drawing and also possible further treatments, so that the multifilament thread can be wound up into a bobbin at the end of the treatments. To pull off and draw the multifilament threads, galettes are normally used, which have a driven guide casing, on the circumference of which at least one of the threads is guided with partial looping. Depending" on the desired drawing or on the drawing forces required for drawing, the thread is looped around the guide casings of the galettes singly or multiply.<br>
DE 103 43 460 Al discloses, for example, a generic method and a generic apparatus, in which a multifilament thread is pulled off and drawn by two driven galettes arranged one behind the other in the thread run. An arrangement of this type is suitable, in particular, for producing what are Icnown as preoriented yarns (POY) having minor or partial drawing.<br>
In order to produce fully drawn yarns, by contrast, higher drawing forces are required, and therefore, to avoid the occurrence of slipping at the galettes, the thread has to be guided with a plurality of loops on the guide casing of the galettes. For this purpose, a<br><br>
galette is assigned a jockey roller, such as is known, for example, from DE 102 27 290 Al. Galette systems having a long projecting length are therefore required, depending on the number of thread loopings on the guide casing of the galettes and as a function of the number of threads guided simultaneously on the guide casing.<br>
Irrespective of the magnitude of the drawing forces, a minimum length of the thread piece tensioned in a drawing zone by two galettes must be adhered to, in order to execute the drawing operation in the multifilament thread. To that extent, in the known method and the known apparatus, the spacing formed between the galettes is determined essentially by the required length of the thread piece.<br>
The object of the invention, then, is to design a method and an apparatus for pulling off and drawing a multifilament thread, of the generic type, in such a v;ay that highly compact arrangements of the galettes can be implemented, irrespective of free, drawing lengths of the thread.<br>
A further aim of the invention is to provide a method and an apparatus of the generic type, in which high drawing forces for producing fully drawn threads can be implemented even by means of singly looped galettes.<br>
The object according to the invention is achieved by means of a method having the features as claimed in claim 1 and by means of an apparatus having the features as claimed in claim 10.<br>
Advantageous developments of the invention are' defined by the features and feature combinations of the respective subclaims.<br><br>
The invention is distinguished in that a thread piece tensioned between the galettes can be selected in terms of its length independently of the arrangement of the galettes in relation to one another. For this purpose, the thread piece is guided as a thread loop between the galettes, the thread being guided at the loop end via a rotatably mounted deflecting roller. Thus, long drawing zones for the thread piece tensioned between the galettes can be implemented in the case of a minimal spacing of the galettes with respect to one another. The apparatus according to the invention has a rotatably' mounted deflecting roller in the thread run between the galettes, which deflecting roller, by its spacing with respect to the galettes, determines the length of the thread loop and consequently the overall length of the tensioned thread piece between the galettes. Owing to the rotatably held deflecting roller, no occurrences of relative movement between the thread piece and the deflecting roller arise, and therefore only the circumferential speeds of the galettes are critical for the guidance of the thread piece.<br>
For integration in a melt-spinning process, the development of the invention is preferably used in which the thread is guided on the circumference of at least one of the guide casings of the galettes with a looping angle of &gt;120Â®. Consequently, either vertically oriented or else even horizontally oriented spinning processes for the production of synthetic threads can be implemented. In this case, to form a symmetrical thread loop, the deflecting roller is held at the same spacing centrally with respect to the galettes.<br>
The development of the invention in which tfie thread piece between the galettes is treated by thermal action and/or swirling is particularly advantageous. Thus, the thermal action upon the thread, which is customary for<br><br>
drawing, can advantageously be carried out in the thread piece between the galettes and the deflecting roller. Consequently, the thermal action systems which involve high losses and in which the thread is guided in multiple looping on a heated guide casing of a galette may be dispensed with entirely. The free zones of the thread loop between the galettes and the deflecting roller may to that extent advantageously be utilized for treating the thread.<br>
For this purpose, the apparatus according to the invention has a treatment device in the thread run between the deflecting roller and at least one of the galettes, so that the thread piece can be treated either in the incoming portion of the thread loop or in the outgoing portion of the thread loop. It is also possible, however, to design the treatment device in such a way that both the incoming portion of the thread loop, upstream of the deflecting roller, and the outgoing portion of the thread loop, dovmstream of the deflecting roller, are treated uniformly by means of a treatment device. Thus, the thread loop according to the invention between the galettes leads"' to high flexibility in the implementation and arrangement of the treatment devices,<br>
For thermal action upon the thread piece, a contactless heating is preferably selected in which the thread piece is heated by means of an infrared radiator. Tubular infrared radiators of this type can, in particular, be co-ordinated in terms of their wavelength with the thread material, so that thermal action can be carried out with high efficiency.<br>
The heat treatment of the thread by means of an infrared radiator may also be improved in that a radiation converter is arranged opposite the infrared radiator,  the thread being guided in the free space<br><br>
between the radiation converter and the infrared radiator. By means of the radiation converter, the infrared beams not having a suitable wavelength can be converted and can be utilized for heating the thread. The output of the infrared beams for heating the thread can consequently be increased appreciably.<br>
A particularly beneficial arrangement can be achieved in that the run-over roller and the galettes have a casing diameter of essentially equal size, and in that the radiant heater is arranged within the thread loop. Thus, both thread pieces of the thread loop can be irradiated simultaneously for heating. Moreover, a highly compact type of construction is obtained.<br>
As a function of the selected type of thread to be produced, the galettes can be driven and controlled either independently of one another with different circumferential speeds of the guide casings or jointly with substantially identical circumferential speeds. In this case, the galettes are preferably assigned separate galette drives which can be activated by means of a coipmon control unit or by means of_ separate control units.<br>
Furthermore, there is also the possibility of driving the run-over roller by means of an electric motor, so that additional influence on the thread tension within the thread loop is afforded.<br>
The development of the invention in which the thread is guided via a plurality of pairs of galettes for drawing, the thread piece tensioned between the galettes being guided as a thread loop on each of the pairs of galettes, is particularly suitable for producing fully drawn threads by means of a- -plurality of treatment steps. Thus, for example, a last pair of galettes can be assigned a heating device which acts<br><br>
thermally upon the thread loop between the galettes in order to carry out shrinkage treatment. Correspondingly, the last galette of the pair of galettes is operated at a somewhat lower circumferential speed than the galette preceding the thread loop.<br>
The melt-spinning processes are customarily operated in such a way that a plurality of threads are produced simultaneously in parallel. The development of the invention is therefore preferably used in which a plurality of threads are guided simultaneously in parallel next to one another on the galettes, so that the guide casings of the galettes are designed to have a corresponding length. In this case, the thread loops formed between the guide casings are preferably guided on the circumference of the deflecting roller with a slight spacing in the range of 3 mm to 8 mm, so that, even in the case of a large number of threads, highly compact guidance and arrangement can be maintained.<br>
The method according to the invention and the apparatus according to the invention are therefore particularly suitable for pulling off and drawing synthetic threads in a melt-spinning process. This is irrespective of whether textile threads, industrial threads, crimped threads or composite threads consisting of the aboveiT^entioned individual threads or fancy threads are produced in the melt-spinning process.<br>
The method according to the invention is explained in more detail below by means of some exemplary embodiments of the apparatus according to the invention, with reference to the accompanying figures in which:<br>
fig. 1   illustrates  diagrammatically a vi^w of  a first exemplary embodiment of the apparatus<br><br>
according to the invention in a POY melt-spinning process,<br>
fig. 2 illustrates diagrammatically a view of a further exemplary embodiment of the apparatus according to the invention in an FDY melt-spinning process,<br>
fig. 3<br>
to<br>
fig 6 illustrate diagranunatically views of further exemplary embodiments of the apparatus acdlStding to the invention for carrying out the method according to the invention..<br>
Figure 1 shows diagrammatically a first exemplary embodiment of the apparatus according to the invention in a melt-spinning process for producing a POY yarn.<br>
For the melt spinning of a multifilament thread, a heatable spinning head 1 is provided, which has on its underside a spinneret 3 with a multiplicity of nozzle orifices and on its top side a melt inflow 2. The melt inflow 2 is coupled, for example, to an extruder by means of a melt source, not illustrated here. Within the spinning head 1 may be arranged further melt-guiding and melt-conveying components "which are not dealt with in any more detail at this juncture.<br>
Below the spinneret 3 is formed a cooling shaft 5 which is connected laterally to a blow-on device 6. Via the blow-on device 6, a cooling air stream can be generated which is introduced into the cooling shaft 5, so that a filament bundle 4 extruded through the spinneret 3 is cooled uniformly.<br>
Below the cooling shaft 5, a collective thread guide 7 and a preparation device 8 are provided in order to bring the filament bundle 4 together to form a thread 9.<br><br>
In order to pull off and draw the thread 9 or the filament bundle 4 from the melt-spinning zone, the apparatus according to the invention is arranged below the preparation device 8. The apparatus has a first driven galette 10.1 and a second driven galette 10.2 which are arranged at a short distance one below the other. A deflecting roller 11 is arranged laterally next to the galettes 10.1 and 10.2. The deflecting roller 11 is in this case preferably located in a mid-plane with respect to the galettes 10.1 and 10.2. The deflecting roller 11 is mounted rotatably and is held with an equal spacing with respect to the galettes 10.1 and 10.2.<br>
For pulling off a.nd drawing the thread 9, the galettes 10.1 and 10.2 and the deflecting roller 11 are arranged in the thread run in such a way that the thread 9 is delivered via the circumference of the galette 10.1 and is led further on via the circumference of the galette 10.2. The thread piece tensioned between the galettes<br>
10.1	and 10.2 is guided as a thread loop 12 between the<br>
galettes 10.1 and 10.2, the end of the thread loop 12<br>
being determined by the position of the deflecting<br>
roller 11, and the thread 9 being deflected on the<br>
circumference of the deflecting roller 11. The thread<br>
piece between the galettes 10.1 and 10.2 is' in this<br>
case swirled in the outgoing portion of the thread loop<br>
12 between the deflecting roller 11 and the galette<br>
10.2	by means of a swirling device 22. For this<br>
purpose, the thread 9 is guided between the galettes<br>
10.1 and 10.2 with a speed difference. For this<br>
purpose, the circumferential speed of the galette 10.2<br>
is set equal to or somewhat lower than the<br>
circumferential speed of the galette 10.1. A drawing of<br>
the thread to tHat extent takes place essentially in<br>
the preceding melt-spinning zone.<br><br>
After running off from the galette 10.2, the--thre&amp;d 9 is guided via a guide roller 13 to a winding device 14. In the winding device 14, the thread 9 is wound into a bobbin 18, the laying of the thread onto the bobbin 18 taking place by means of a traversing device 15 and a pressure roller 16. The bobbin 18 is held via a driven winding spindle 17.<br>
The exemplary embodiment illustrated in fig. 1 shows a first application possibility for the use of the method according to the invention and the apparatus according to the invention. By the thread loop being guided laterally next to the galettes 10.1 and 10.2, treatment zones can be formed on the thread and advantageously are formed so as to be oriented transversely with respect to the thread run, so that a highly compact galette arrangement below the cooling shaft 5 leads to a very short and compact overall apparatus. In this case, for example, for relaxing the thread 9, the incoming portion of the thread loop could be assigned a further treatment device, in order, for example, to heat the thread piece between the galette 10.1 and the deflecting roller 11. In addition to relaxation, the swirling results for producing a thread closure can be improved.<br>
Fig. 2 shows diagrammatically a further exemplary embodiment of the apparatus according to the invention for carrying out the method according to the invention in a melt-spinning process for producing a fully drawn thread (FDY). The overall apparatus illustrated in fig. 2 differs essentially only in the design of the method according to the invention and of the apparatus according to the invention. The devices for the melt spinning of the multifilament thread and the devices for winding the multifilament thread are identical to the abovementioned exemplary embodiment according to<br><br>
fig. 1, and therefore reference is made at this juncture to the abovementioned description.<br>
For pulling off and drawing the multifilament thread, the apparatus according to the invention is designed with a plurality of pairs of galettes 32.1 and 32.2. The first pair of galettes 32.1 is formed by the galettes 10.1 and 10.2 which directly follow the preparation device 8. Between the galettes 10.1 and 10.2, a first deflecting roller 11.1 is arranged in each case with an equal spacing with respect to the galettes 10.1 and 10.2. In the spacing between the deflecting roller 11.1 and the galettes 10.1 and 10.2 is arranged a heating device 20 which has two infrared radiators 21.1 and 21.2 lying opposite one another. The thread loop 12 is guided between the infrared radiators<br>
21.1	and 21.2. For this purpose, the thread 9 is<br>
delivered via the circumference of the galette 10.1.<br>
The thread piece tensioned between the galettes 10.1<br>
and 10.2 is deflected by the deflecting roller 11.1 at<br>
the end of the thread loop 12, the incoming portion of<br>
the thread loop 12 being heated by the infrared<br>
radiator 21.1 and the outgoing thread portion of the<br>
thread loop 12 being heated by the infrared radiator<br>
21.2. The thread 9 is subsequently guided via the<br>
circumference of the galette 10.2 into a drawing zone<br>
formed between the pairs of galettes 32.1 and_32.2.<br>
The pair of galettes 32.2 is formed by the galettes 10.3 and 10.4 which are assigned a deflecting roller<br>
11.2	arranged with a spacing with respect to these. The<br>
deflecting roller 11.2 is arranged in a middle region<br>
with an essentially identical spacing with respect to<br>
the galettes 10.3 and 10.4. The thread piece tensioned<br>
between the galettes 10.3 and 10.4 is thus likewise<br>
guided as a thread loop 12 via the circumference of the<br>
deflecting roller 11.2. A swirling device 22 is<br>
provided in the outgoing portion of the thread loop 12<br><br>
between the deflecting roller 11.2 and the galette 10.4.<br>
The pair of galettes 32.2 is followed by the winding device 14, so that the thread 9 running off from the last galette 10.4 is wound into a bobbin 18.<br>
In the melt-spinning process illustrated in fig. 2, the thread 9 is pulled off and drawn via the two pairs of galettes 32.1 and 32.2. For this purpose, the galettes 10.1 and 10.2 of the first pair of galettes 32.1 are driven essentially at the same circumferential speed, the thread 9 being acted upon thermally between the galettes 10.1 and 10.2 within the thread loop 12. For this purpose, each portion of the thread loop is assigned a separate infrared radiator 21.1 and 21.2- A speed difference is set between the pairs of galettes 32.1 and 32.2 in such a way that the galette 10.3 rotates at a higher circumferential speed than the galette 10.2. The thread 9 is thus drawn between the pairs of galettes 32.1 and 32.2. Before the thread 9 is wound up, the latter undergoes swirling which is carried out directly before the run-off of the last galette 10.4. The galettes 10.3 and 10.4 are operated with a slight speed difference.<br>
The exemplary embodiment illustrated in fig. 2 shows an application of the apparatus according to the^ invention and of the method according to the invention in the production of fully drawn threads. Particularly advantageously, as compared with the apparatus knowii in the prior art, thread guidance with single looping on the galettes 10.1 to 10.4 is obtained. To that extent, guide casings having a long projecting length for receiving a plurality of loopings of the thread are no longer required. Moreover, thermal action can advantageously be implemented in the region of the thread loops between the galettes 10.1 and 10.2.<br><br>
Fig. 3 illustrates diagrammatically a further exemplary embodiment of an apparatus according to the invention. The apparatus differs essentially from the exemplary embodiment shovm in fig. 1 in a parallel guidance of a plurality of threads on the circumference of the galettes.<br>
For this purpose, the galette 10.1 has a guide casing 19.1 which is mounted rotatably on a galette carrier 24.1 and which is driven in the direction of the arrow by means of a drive, not illustrated here. The second galette 10.2, lying next to it at a short distance, likewise has a guide casing 19.2 which is held rotatably on. the galette carrier 24.2 and which is driven co-directionally with the first galette by means of a drive, not illustrated here. In the middle region between the galettes 10.1 and 10.2, a deflecting roller 11 is arranged with a spacing with respect to the guide casings 19.1 and 19.2. The deflecting roller 11 is mounted rotatably on a shaft 23, the shaft 23 being fastened to a carrier 33. Between the deflecting roller 11 and the galette 10.2 which follows in the thread run, a treatment device 25 is provided, which could be designed, for example, as a heating device or as a swirling device.<br>
The apparatus illustrated in fig. 3 is provided for the guidance of a plurality of parallel-running threads 9. For this purpose, in this exemplary embodiment, two parallel-running threads 9 are guided in each case with partial looping on the guide casings 19.1 and 19.2. The thread loops 12 formed between the guide casings 19.1 and 19.2 and the deflecting roller 11 likewise run parallel next to one another, a thread spacing a between the thread loops preferably being set in the range of 3 to 8 mm. Consequently, even in the case of a large n\amber of threads, compact and short galettes and run-over rol lers can be used. The threads 9 run in<br><br>
parallel into the treatment device 2 5 in order simultaneously to undergo thermal action or to be swirled. It may expressly be mentioned at this juncture that the exemplary embodiments shown above,, .and the exemplary embodiments shown below are not restricted to the guidance of one thread, but, instead, a plurality of parallel-running threads could likewise be pulled off and drawn simultaneously.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a further exemplary embodiment of an apparatus according to the invention, such as could be used, for example, in a melt-spinning process illustrated in fig. 2.<br>
The exemplary embodiment according to fig. 4 has, overall, two pairs of galettes 32.1 and 32.2. The deflecting roller 11.1 is assigned to the galettes 10.1 and 10.2 and the deflecting roller 11.2 is assigned to the galettes 10.3 and 10.4 of the second pair of galettes 32.2. At each pair of galettes 32.1 and 32.2, the thread 9 is guided between the galettes as a thread loop 12. In this case, both the thread loop 12 of the first pair of galettes 32.1 and the thread loop of the second pair of galettes 32.2 are acted upon thermally in each case by means of a heating device 20.1 and 20.2. The heating devices 20.1 and 20.2 are constructed identically and have a plurality of infrared radiators 21.1 and 21.2. In the event that a plurality of threads are guided in parallel on the circumference of the galettes 10.1 to 10.4, further infrared radiators, not illustrated here, could be integrated within the heating device 20.1 and 20.2.<br>
The galettes 10.1 and 10.2 of the first pair of galettes 32.1 are driven via separate galette drives 26.1 and 26.2. The galette drives 26.1 and 26.2 are assigned to a control unit 27, so that the galettes 10.1 and 10.2 are operated preferably at identical<br><br>
circxomferential speeds. By contrast, the galettes 10.3 and 10.4 of the second pair of galettes 32.2 are driven by means of separate galette drives 26.3 and 26.4 and separate control units 28.1 and 28.2. The galettes 10.3 and 10.4 can consequently be operated preferably at different circumferential speeds.<br>
So that high drawing forces between the pairs of galettes and for pulling off the thread can be generated, the thread 9 is guided on the galettes with a looping angle in the region of &gt;120=, preferably &gt;160-. The looping angle is in this case depicted by reference symbol a as an example at the galette 10.1. The thread loop on the circumference of the deflecting roller 11.1 and 11.2 is preferably generated with a looping angle in the region of 180=.<br>
The exemplary embodiment illustrated in fig. 4 is to that extent particularly suitable for carrying out high drawing on a synthetic thread. Thus, further pairs of galettes, with or without a heating device, can be added, so that, in addition to drawing, shrinkage treatment, for example in the production of industrial yarn, is also possible at the same time. So that, in the exemplary embodiment illustrated in fig. 4, shrinkage treatment can be carried out at the last pair of galettes 33.2, the galettes 10.3 and 10.4 are preferably driven with a speed difference in such a way that the thread piece between the galettes 10.3 and 10.4 can undergo relajcation within the thread-loop 12.<br>
Fig. 5 shows a further exemplary embodiment of the apparatus according to the invention, such as could be used, for example, in the melt-spinning process illustrated in fig. 1 or fig. 2. The exemplary embodiment is designed essentially identically to the exemplary embodiments illustrated in fig. 1 and 3, and<br><br>
therefore only the differences are explained at this juncture.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment illustrated in fig. 5, the deflecting roller 11.1 is guided movably between the galettes 10.1 and 10.2 on a guide rail 31. The deflecting roller 11 can be adjusted to and fro between a feed position and an operating position on the guide rail 31. The feed position is depicted by dashes In fig. 5. The guide rail 31 ends within a heating chamber 29 in the operating position. The deflecting roller 11 is held within the heating chamber 29 in the operating position, so that the thread loop 12 formed between the galettes 10.1 and 10.2 is held essentially within the heating chamber 29. Within the heating chamber 29, the portions of the thread loop are assigned heating elements 30 which carry out a heating of the thread 9 preferably contactlessly or else even by contact.<br>
The movably held deflecting roller 11 in the exemplary embodiment according to fig. 5 makes it possible to thread in the thread 9 in a simple way at the start of the process. Thus, the thread 9 can be guided with single looping around the two galettes 10.1 and 10.2. The situation is illustrated by dashes. The deflecting roller 11 is then guided out of the feed position into the operating position, the thread 9 being picked up between the galettes 10.1 and 10.2 and being guided to the opposite side of the galette in a thread loop 12. As soon as the deflecting roller 11 has reached the operating position within the heating chamber 29, the feed operation is terminated.<br>
The exemplary embodiment illustrated in fig. 5 can selectively be combined with the exemplary embodiments of the apparatus according to the invention which were shown above, so that, even if a plurality of pairs of<br><br>
galettes are used, the feed of the thread can be carried out in a simple way.<br>
Fig. 6 shows a further exemplary ernbodiment of the apparatus according to the invention, such as could be used, for example, in the melt-spinning-^ ' process illustrated in fig. 1 or fig. 2. The exemplary embodiment is essentially identical to the variants described above, and therefore only the differences are explained at this juncture in order to avoid repetition.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment illustrated in fig. 6, the deflecting roller 11 is arranged in the middle region above the galettes 10.1 and 10.2. The deflecting roller 11 and the galettes 10.1 and 10.2 have in each case a guide casing of identical size, so that the thread 9 is guided at the run-over roller 11 and the galettes 10.1 and 10.2 on an identical casing diameter.<br>
In the region below the run-over roller 11 and above the galettes 10.1 and 10.2, an infrared radiator 21 is arranged as a treatment device. The infrared radiator 21 is designed in such a way that radiation is generated on each of the two longitudinal sides and is directed immediately onto a thread piece of the thread loop 12. Each longitudinal side of the infrared radiator 21 is assigned a radiation converter 34.1 and 34.2. In this case, the radiation converter 34.1 above the galette 10.1 forms together with the infrared radiator 21 a free space through which the. thread piece, running from the galette 10.1 to the run-over roller 11, of the thread loop 12 is guided. On the opposite side, the running-off thread piece of the thread loop 12 is guided from the run-over roller 11 to the second galette 10.2 through a second free space which extends between the infrared radiator 21 and the second radiation converter 34.2.<br><br>
For guiding and drawing the thread 9, the galette 10.1 is driven by the galette drive 2 6.1 and the galette 10.2 is driven by the galette drive 26.2. In this cS-se, the galette drives 26.1 and 2 6.2 are activated independently of one another via the control units 2 8.1 and 2 8.2.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment illustrated in fig. 6, the deflecting roller 11 is mounted rotatably, so that a thread tension generated as a result of the speed difference between the galettes 10.1 and 10.2 acts on the thread 9. Alternatively, there is, however, also the possibility of likewise providing the run-over roller 11 with an active drive. For this purpose, for example, an electric motor with a control unit is illustrated by dashes in figure 6. Consequently, for example, drawing forces can additionally be generated in order to obtain an intensification of the drawing. Moreover, by means of the drive of the deflecting roller, a thread tension can be set upstream of the galettes 10.2 in such a way that, for example, a swirling of the thread can be carried out. The circumferential speed of the galette 10.2 can advantageously be set in such a way that a winding tension desired for winding up the thread prevails.<br>
For heating the thread within the thread loop 12, the action of the infrared radiator 21 is increased considerably by means of the assigned radiation converters 34.1 and 34.2. Thus, for example, it is known that, in particular, radiations in the medium wavelength range are particularly effective^ 'for the heating of polymer materials. Polymer materials absorb infrared radiation predominantly in the wavelength range of 3 to 5 fom. Very short-wave and very long-wave infrared radiations, which are likewise generated by an infrared radiator, cause no appreciable heating of the thread on account of the absence of the absorption<br><br>
action of the thread material. The unused radiation, then, is converted into a medium-wave radiation by the radiation converter 34.1 and 34.2 and is reflected. Consequently, the electrical power of the radiator can be utilized with higher efficiency in order to heat the thread. Moreover, a uniform full heating of the thread by irradiation on both sides  is achieved.  To that extent, the exemplary embodiment illustrated in fig. 6 is particularly suitable for generating defined drawing points during the drawing of the thread. Alternatively, however, there is also the possibility that,  in the exemplary embodiment illustrated in fig. 6, only the thread piece between the galette 10.1 and the run-over roller 11 is heated.<br>
The method according to the invention and the apparatus according to the invention are not restricted to the melt-spinning processes illustrated in fig. 1 and 2. On the contrary, the method according to the invention and the apparatus according to the invention, can be integrated in any melt-spinning process for producing a multifilament thread, in order to pull off and draw one or more threads after the melt spinning. Advantageously, in this case, different treatment steps and treatments may also be carried out, so that, in addition to textile applications, threads for industrial applications can also consequently be produced. Composite threads or crimped threads, such as, for example, carpet yarns, can therefore also be generated.<br><br>
