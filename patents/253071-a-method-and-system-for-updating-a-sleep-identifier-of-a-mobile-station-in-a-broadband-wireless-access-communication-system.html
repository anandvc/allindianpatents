SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR UPDATING A SLEEP ID OF A MOBILE<br>
STATION IN A BWA COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to a Broadband Wireless Access<br>
(BWA) communication system, and in particular, to a method for updating<br>
information on a sleep identifier allocated to a mobile station, and a system using<br>
the same.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
Active research on the 4th generation (4G) communication system, which<br>
is the next generation communication system, is being conducted to provide users<br>
with high-rate services supporting various Quality-of-Services (QoSs). Recently,<br>
many studies of the 4G communication system are being made to support a high-<br>
speed service capable of guaranteeing the mobility and the QoS in a BWA<br>
communication system such as a wireless Local Area Network (LAN) system and<br>
a wireless Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) system. The typical example BWA<br>
system is the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.16a<br>
communication system or the IEEE 802.16e communication system.<br>
The IEEE 802.16a communication system and the IEEE 802.16e<br>
communication system utilize Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing<br>
(OFDM) and Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) to<br>
support a broadband transmission network for a physical channel of the wireless<br>
MAN system. More specifically, the IEEE 802.16a communication system does<br>
not consider the mobility of subscriber stations (SSs), i.e., is directed to fixed<br>
MSs and a unicell structure. However, the IEEE 802.16e communication system<br>
considers the mobility of the SSs. Herein, an SS having the mobility will be<br>
referred to as a mobile station (MS).<br>
The IEEE 802.16e communication system, as it considers the mobility of<br>
MSs, has a problem of high MS power consumption compared with other systems.<br>
As a typical method for minimizing the MS power consumption, a sleep mode<br>
and an awake mode between the MS and a base station (BS) have been proposed.<br>
In this case, the MS performs a ranging operation of periodically adjusting a<br>
timing offset, a frequency offset, and power with the BS in order to cope with a<br><br>
change in the quality of a channel to the BS. In particular, a periodic ranging<br>
operation is very important for the IEEE 802.16e communication system as it<br>
considers the mobility of MSs.<br>
FIG. 1 is a diagram illustrating a sleep mode operation of a conventional<br>
IEEE 802.16e communication system. However, before a description of FIG. 1 is<br>
given, it should be noted that the sleep mode has been proposed to minimize MS<br>
power consumption in an idle interval for which no packet data is transmitted,<br>
during transmission of packet data. That is, in the sleep mode, an MS and a BS<br>
simultaneously transition to the sleep mode to minimize the MS power<br>
consumption in the idle interval in which no packet data is transmitted.<br>
Generally, the interval for which no packet data is transmitted is equal in<br>
operation to the interval for which packet data is transmitted. Because such an<br>
operation is unreasonable, the sleep mode has been proposed. If there is packet<br>
data to transmit in the sleep mode, both the BS and the MS must simultaneously<br>
transition to the awake mode to transmit and receive packet data.<br>
The sleep mode has been proposed to minimize the power consumption<br>
and inter-channel interference. However, because packet data is affected by traffic,<br>
the traffic characteristic and transmission type characteristic must be taken into<br>
consideration in the sleep mode operation.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, reference numeral 110 denotes a packet data<br>
generation format. The packet data generation format 110 includes a plurality of<br>
ON intervals and a plurality of OFF intervals. The ON intervals are burst intervals<br>
for which packet data, i.e., traffic, is generated, and the OFF intervals are idle<br>
intervals for which no traffic is generated. According to the traffic generation<br>
pattern, the MS and the BS alternately transition (mode change) to the sleep mode<br>
and the awake mode, thereby minimizing power consumption of the MS and<br>
canceling interference between channel signals.<br>
Reference numeral 120 denotes a mode change format for the MS and the<br>
BS. The mode change format 120 for the MS and the BS includes a plurality of<br>
awake modes and a plurality of sleep modes. The awake modes represent the<br>
modes in which traffic is generated, and in the awake modes, actual transmission<br>
and reception of packet data is achieved. The sleep modes represent the modes in<br>
which no traffic is generated, and in the sleep modes, actual transmission and<br>
reception of the packet data is not achieved.<br><br>
Reference numeral 130 denotes an MS power level format that represents<br>
a power level of the MS according to the packet data generation format 110 and<br>
the mode change format 120. In the MS power level format 130, an MS power<br>
level for the awake mode is represented by 'K', and an MS power level for the<br>
sleep mode is represented by 'M'. Comparing the MS power level K for the<br>
awake mode with the MS power level M for the sleep mode, the M is much less<br>
than the K. That is, in the sleep mode, because there is no packet data<br>
transmission/reception, the power consumption is insignificant.<br>
A description will now be made herein below of the schemes currently<br>
proposed to support the sleep mode operation in the IEEE 802.16e<br>
communication system. However, before a description of the schemes currently<br>
proposed in the IEEE 802.16e communication system is given, the following<br>
preconditions will be described.<br>
In order to transition to the sleep mode, the MS must receive a mode<br>
change approval from the BS. The BS transmits an approval for transition to the<br>
sleep mode to the MS and then transmits packet data. The BS must transmit<br>
information indicating the presence of transmission packet data to the MS, during<br>
a listening interval of the MS. In this case, the MS must awake from the sleep<br>
mode and determine if there is packet data to be transmitted thereto from the BS.<br>
If it is determined that there is packet data to be transmitted thereto from<br>
the BS, the MS transitions to the awake mode and receives packet data form the<br>
BS. However, if it is determined that there is no packet data to be transmitted<br>
thereto from the BS, the MS can either return to the sleep mode or maintain the<br>
awake mode.<br>
Parameters for Supporting Sleep Mode and Awake Mode Operations<br>
A description will now be made of the parameters required to support the<br>
sleep mode and awake mode operations currently proposed in the IEEE 802.16e<br>
communication system.<br>
(1) Sleep Identifier (SLPID)<br>
The SLPID is a value that an MS is allocated through a Sleep-Response<br>
(SLP-RSP) message for transitioning from the awake mode to the sleep mode,<br>
and is uniquely allocated only to the MSs in the sleep mode. That is, the SLPID is<br>
an ID used for identifying an MS in the sleep mode including the listening<br>
interval, and if the corresponding MS makes a mode change from the sleep mode<br><br>
to the awake mode, the SLPID previously allocated to the MS is returned to the<br>
BS so that another MS wanting to transition to the sleep mode can reuse the<br>
SLPID through the SLP-RSP message. Commonly, the SLPID has a 10-bit size,<br>
and thus can be used for identifying a total of 1024 MSs in sleep mode operation.<br>
(2) Sleep Interval<br>
The sleep interval is an interval that a BS allocates to an MS at the<br>
request of the MS, and represents the time interval for which the MS maintains<br>
the sleep mode until a listening interval starts after the MS makes a mode change<br>
from the awake mode to the sleep mode. That is, the sleep interval is defined as<br>
the total time interval for which the MS is in the sleep mode.<br>
The MS can continuously maintain the sleep mode if there is no data<br>
transmitted from the BS even after the sleep interval. In this case, the MS updates<br>
the sleep interval while increasing the sleep interval using predetermined initial-<br>
sleep window and final-sleep window values. The initial-sleep window value<br>
represents an initial minimum value of the sleep interval, and the final-sleep<br>
window value represents a final maximum value of the sleep interval. The initial-<br>
sleep window value and the final-sleep window value can be represented by the<br>
number of frames.<br>
The listening interval is an interval that a BS allocates to an MS at the<br>
request of the MS. The listening interval corresponds to the time interval for<br>
which the MS temporarily awakes to receive downlink messages such as a traffic<br>
indication (TRF-IND) message from the BS during the sleep mode operation, and<br>
in the listening interval, the MS can receive the downlink messages in<br>
synchronism with a downlink signal from the BS. The TRF-IND message<br>
indicates if there is traffic to be transmitted to the MS, i.e., indicates if there is<br>
packet data.<br>
The MS continuously waits for the reception of the TRF-IND message<br>
for the listening interval. If a bit indicating the MS in an SLPID bitmap included<br>
in the TRF-IND message represents a positive indication value, the MS<br>
continuously maintains the awake mode, thereby transitioning to the awake mode.<br>
However, if the bit indicating the MS in the SLPID bitmap included in the TRF-<br>
IND message represents a negative indication value, the MS transitions back to<br>
the sleep mode.<br><br>
(3) Sleep Interval Update Algorithm<br>
Upon transitioning to the sleep mode, the MS determines a sleep interval,<br>
regarding the minimum window value as the minimum sleep mode interval.<br>
Thereafter, if the MS wakes up from the sleep mode for the listening interval and<br>
determines that there is no packet data to be transmitted from the BS, the MS sets<br>
the sleep interval to an interval that is 2 times the previous sleep interval, and<br>
continuously maintains the sleep mode. For example, if the minimum window<br>
value is '2', the MS sets the sleep interval to an interval of 2 frames, and then<br>
maintains the sleep mode for the 2 frames. After a lapse of the 2 frames, the MS<br>
awakes from the sleep mode for the listening interval, and determines if a TRF-<br>
IND message is received. If the TRF-IND message is not received, i.e., if there is<br>
no packet data to be transmitted thereto from the BS, the MS sets the sleep<br>
interval to a 4-frame interval, which is 2 times the 2-frame interval, and then<br>
maintains the sleep mode for the 4 frames. Accordingly, the sleep interval can<br>
increase between the minimum window value and the maximum window value.<br>
Messages for Supporting Sleep Mode and Awake Mode Operation<br>
A description will now be made of the messages currently defined to<br>
support the sleep mode and awake mode operations in the IEEE 802.16e<br>
communication system.<br>
(1) Sleep-Request (SLP-REQ) Message<br>
The SLP-REQ message, a message transmitted from an MS to a BS, is<br>
used when the MS requests a mode change to the sleep mode. The SLP-REQ<br>
message includes the parameters, or information elements (IEs), required by the<br>
MS to operate in the sleep mode. A format of the SLP-REQ message is shown<br>
below in Table 1.<br><br><br>
The SLP-REQ message is a dedicated message transmitted on the basis of<br>
a connection ID (CID) of an MS, and IES of the SLP-REQ message include a<br>
Management Message Type, an Initial-Sleep Window, a Final-Sleep Window, and<br>
a Listening Interval. The Management Message Type indicates a type of the<br>
current transmission message, and Management Message Type=50 indicates the<br>
SLP-REQ message. The Initial-Sleep Window indicates a requested start value<br>
for the sleep interval (measured in frames), and the Final-Sleep Window indicates<br>
a requested stop value for the sleep interval (measured in frames). That is, as<br>
described with reference to the sleep interval update algorithm, the sleep interval<br>
can be updated between the initial-window value and the final-window value. The<br>
Listening Interval indicates a requested listening interval (measured in frames),<br>
and the listening interval can also be represented by the number of frames.<br>
(2) Sleep-Response (SLP-RSP) Message<br>
The SLP-RSP message, a response message to the SLP-REQ message,<br>
can be used to approve or deny a mode change to the sleep mode requested by the<br>
MS, or can be used to indicate an unsolicited instruction. The SLP-RSP message<br>
includes IEs needed by the MS to operate in the sleep mode, and a format of the<br>
SLP-RSP message is shown in Table 2.<br><br><br><br>
The SLP-RSP message is also a dedicated message transmitted on the<br>
basis of a Basic CID of an MS, and IEs of the SLP-RSP message illustrated in<br>
Table 2 will be described below.<br>
Management Message Type indicates a type of the current transmission<br>
message, and Management Message Type=51 indicates the SLP-RSP message.<br>
Sleep-Approved is expressed with 1 bit, wherein Sleep-Approved=0 indicates<br>
sleep-mode request denied and Sleep-Approved=l indicates sleep-mode request<br>
approved. More specifically, Sleep-Approved=0 indicates that a mode change to<br>
the sleep mode requested by the MS is denied by the BS. Upon receiving the<br>
denial, the MS transmits the SLP-REQ message to the BS according to conditions,<br>
or waits for the reception of the SLP-RSP message indicating unsolicited<br>
instruction from the BS.<br>
For Sleep-Approved=l, the SLP-RSP message includes Start Frame, Initial-Sleep<br>
Window, Final-Sleep Window, Listening Interval, and SLPID. For Sleep-<br>
Approved=0, the SLP-RSP message includes After-REQ-Action and REQ-<br>
Duration. The Start Frame value indicates a frame value up to the time when the<br>
MS enters the first sleep interval, and does not include the frame where the SLP-<br>
RSP message is received (the number of frames (not including the frame in which<br>
the message has been received) until the MS shall enter the first sleep interval).<br>
That is, the MS transitions to the sleep mode after a lapse of frames<br>
corresponding to the start frame value from the next frame after the frame over<br>
which the SLP-RSP message has been received. The SLPID is used for<br>
identifying MSs in the sleep mode, and can be used for identifying a total of 1024<br>
MSs in the sleep mode.<br><br>
As described above, the Initial-Sleep Window value indicates a start<br>
value for the sleep interval (measured in frames), and the listening interval value<br>
indicates a value for the listening interval (measured in frames). The Final-Sleep<br>
Window value indicates a stop value for the sleep interval (measured in frames).<br>
The After-REQ-action value indicates an operation that the MS, whose request to<br>
the sleep mode has been denied, must perform.<br>
(3) Traffic Indication (TRF-IND) Message<br>
The TRF-IND message, a message transmitted from a BS to an MS for<br>
the listening interval, indicates the presence of packet data to be transmitted from<br>
the BS to the MS. A format of the TRF-IND message is shown below in Table 3.<br><br>
The TRF-IND message is a broadcasting message that is transmitted on a<br>
broadcasting basis, unlike the SLP-REQ message and the SLP-RSP message. The<br>
TRF-IND message indicates the presence/absence of packet data to be transmitted<br>
from the BS to a particular MS, and the MS encodes the broadcasted TRF-IND<br><br>
message for the listening interval, and determines whether to transition to the<br>
awake mode, or to transition back to the sleep mode, according to the decoding<br>
result.<br>
When determining to transition to the awake mode, the MS detects frame<br>
synchronization, and if a corresponding frame sequence number is not identical to<br>
a frame sequence number expected by the MS, the MS can request retransmission<br>
of the packet data lost in the awake mode. Otherwise, if the MS fails to receive<br>
the TRF-IND message for the listening interval, or if a value indicating positive<br>
indication is not included in the TRF-IND message even though the TRF-IND<br>
message is received, the MS may return to the sleep mode.<br>
For the IEs in the TRF-IND message, Management Message Type<br>
indicates a type of the current transmission message, and Management Message<br>
Type=52 indicates the TRF-IND message. FMT indicates whether to use an<br>
SLPID or a Basic CID of an MS in the process of indicating the presence/absence<br>
of the traffic to be transmitted to the MS in the sleep mode. When the SLPID is<br>
used for the indication, the SLPID bitmap indicates a set of indication indexes<br>
allocated bit by bit to each of the SLPIDs allocated to MSs to identify the MSs<br>
that has transitioned to the sleep mode. That is, the SLPID bitmap indicates a<br>
group of bits allocated bit by bit to each MS, for (maximum value - 1) SLPIDs<br>
among the SLPIDs allocated to the MS in the sleep mode. The SLPID bitmap<br>
may be allocated dummy bits through byte alignment.<br>
One bit allocated to the MS indicates the presence/absence of data to be<br>
transmitted from the BS to the corresponding MS. Therefore, an MS in the sleep<br>
mode reads a bit mapped to an SLPID that was allocated during a mode change to<br>
the sleep mode from the TRF-IND message received for the listening interval,<br>
and if the read bit indicates a positive indication value, i.e., a value of '1', the MS<br>
continuously maintains the awake mode, thereby transitioning to the awake mode.<br>
Otherwise, if the allocated bit indicates a negative value, i.e., a value of '0', the<br>
MS transitions back to the sleep mode.<br>
The BS sequentially allocates SLPIDs to MSs entering the sleep mode in<br>
the order of an SLPID with the smaller number among unallocated SLPIDs.<br>
During the sleep mode, the MS continuously uses the fixed SLPID allocated from<br>
the BS in the initial phase of the sleep mode until it returns to the awake mode.<br><br>
In this case, each MS that has entered the sleep mode must read the<br>
SLPID bitmap from its beginning until a corresponding part where its own SLPID<br>
is located, in order to determine the present/absence of packet data transmitted<br>
thereto. Because the SLPID that the MS is allocated is fixed to the initially<br>
allocated number, if there are many unallocated empty SLPIDs in the SLPID<br>
bitmap, there is a considerable waste of resources and time required for reading<br>
SLPIDs. That is, increasing the number of MSs entering the sleep mode increases<br>
SLPID numbers allocated to the MSs. Therefore, an MS with a greater SLPID<br>
number, as its allocated SLPID number is fixed, has a long processing time for<br>
reading and processing the SLPID bitmap up to its traffic SLPID. In addition,<br>
though the number of MSs that have actually entered the sleep mode is not large,<br>
if a difference between the least SLPID and the greatest SLPID among the<br>
SLPIDs allocated to the MSs is great, the SLPID bitmap excessively increases.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the present invention has been designed to solve the above<br>
and other problems occurring in the prior art.<br>
It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a method for<br>

corresponding MS and transmitting the SLPID to the corresponding MS. The MS ,<br>
upon receiving SLPID update information from the BS during the sleep mode,<br>

update information.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS<br>
Several exemplary embodiments of the present invention will now be<br>
described in detail with reference to the annexed drawings. In the following<br>
description a detailed description of known functions and configurations<br>
incorporated herein has been omitted for conciseness.<br>
The present invention proposes a sleep identifier (SLPID) updating<br>
scheme for a mobile station (MS) in a sleep mode in an Institute of Electrical and<br>
Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.16e communication system, which is a<br>
Broadband Wireless Access (BWA) communication system. "SLPID updating"<br>
refers to a process in which a base station (BS) reallocates a new SLPID to an MS<br>
in the sleep mode during the sleep mode operation, instead of the SLPID<br>
allocated in the initial phase of the sleep mode process. Accordingly, the present<br>
invention can efficiently manage SLPID resources through the SLPID updating.<br>
Although the present invention, by way of example, will be described<br>
herein with reference to the IEEE 802.16e communication system, the present<br>
invention can also be applied to all other communication systems supporting the<br>
sleep mode operation and periodic ranging in the sleep mode operation.<br>
First Embodiment<br>
In an SLPID update method according to a first embodiment of the<br>
present invention, a BS updates an SLPID in a periodic ranging operation with an<br>
MS in a sleep mode. However, before a description of a periodic ranging-based<br>
SLPID update method according to the first embodiment of the present invention<br>
is given, a brief description will now be made of the ranging.<br>
The ranging is classified into initial ranging, periodic ranging, and<br>
bandwidth request ranging. Before transmitting data through the ranging<br>
operation, an MS can correct transmission power and correct a timing offset and a<br>
frequency offset.<br>
The initial ranging is ranging performed by a BS to acquire<br>
synchronization with an MS, and the initial ranging is performed to detect a<br>
correct timing offset between the MS and the BS and to correct transmission<br>
power. That is, upon power-on, the MS'performs the initial ranging to acquire<br>
synchronization with the BS by receiving a DL-MAP message and a UL-MAP<br><br>
message and to correct the timing offset and the transmission power with the BS.<br>
The periodic ranging represents ranging periodically performed by the<br>
MS to correct channel conditions with the BS after correcting the timing offset<br>
and transmission power with the BS through the initial ranging, and the<br>
bandwidth request ranging is ranging in which the MS requests allocation of a<br>
bandwidth to perform actual communication with the BS after correcting the<br>
timing offset and transmission power with the BS through the initial ranging.<br>
As described above, because the IEEE 802.16e communication system<br>
considers the mobility of MSs, the periodic ranging for the MSs is very important<br>
for reliable data transmission/reception. The periodic ranging is an operation for<br>
measuring and correcting the parameters required for enabling the MS to<br>
communicate with a BS. The BS must allocate uplink resources such that the MS<br>
can perform periodic ranging, i.e., the MS can transmit a ranging request (RNG-<br>
REQ) message to the BS. That is, the BS must allocate uplink resources to the<br>
MS for periodic ranging of the MS, and must transmit the uplink resource<br>
allocation information to the MS through a UL-MAP message.<br>
The MS transmits the RNG-REQ message to the BS through the uplink<br>
resource allocated from the BS, thereby performing periodic ranging with the BS.<br>
The BS corrects the transmission power, timing offset, and frequency offset<br>
according to the RNG-REQ message received from the MS, and then transmits a<br>
ranging response (RNG-RSP) message to the MS in response to the RNG-REQ<br>
message, ending the periodic ranging. Even the MS in the sleep mode must<br>
perform the periodic ranging to reliably communicate with the BS.<br>
FIG. 2 is a flowchart illustrating an SLPID update process performed in a<br>
BS in a periodic ranging operation with an MS in a sleep mode in a<br>
communication system according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG 2, in step 201, a BS receives an RNG-REQ message for periodic<br>
ranging from an MS in a sleep mode. In step 203, the BS determines if there is a<br>
need to update an SLPID of the MS in the sleep mode. More specifically, in step<br>
203, the BS determines if there is an empty SLPID in a list of SLPIDs with a<br>
number less than that of the current SLPID of the corresponding MS in the total<br>
SLPID list managed in the BS. The empty SLPID can correspond to an SLPID<br>
returned to the BS when another MS using the SLPID previously allocated from<br>
the BS transitions to the awake mode. If there are a plurality of empty SLPIDs, it<br><br>
is preferable to newly allocate and update the least SLPID among the empty<br>
SLPIDs. In this manner, an SLPID of the MS can be continuously updated with a<br>
smaller SLPID rather thin being fixed to the initially allocated SLPID.<br>
For example, assuming that the lowest SLPID that the BS can allocate to<br>
the MS in the sleep mode is an SLPID#1 and an SLPID initially allocated to the<br>
MS is an SLPID#99, if there are unused SLPIDs between the SLPID#1 and the<br>
current SLPID#99 for the MS that has transmitted the RNG-REQ message, the<br>
BS can newly allocate the least one of the empty SLPIDs to the MS.<br>
If it is determined in step 203 that there is a need to update the SLPID of<br>
the MS, i.e., if the BS determines the presence of unused SLPIDs between the<br>
least SLPID allocable to the MS in the sleep mode and the SLPID of the MS, the<br>
BS creates an RNG-RSP message including information used for updating the<br>
SLPID of the MS in the 'sleep mode in step 205. That is, the BS creates an SLPID<br>
currently used by the MS and SLPID information to be newly allocated to the MS<br>
in an SLPID_Update field of the RNG-RSP message, which is a response<br>
message to the RNG-REQ message, and stores the RNG-RSP message. Preferably,<br>
the BS creates the current SLPID used by the MS and the SLPID information to<br>
be newly allocated to the MS in pair.<br>
Thereafter, in step 207, the BS transmits the RNG-RSP message<br>
including the created SLPID information to the MS. However, if it is determined<br>
in step 203 that there is no need to update the SLPID of the MS, the BS transmits<br>
an RNG-RSP message with no SLPID_Update value to the MS in step 207.<br>
The SLPIDUpdate parameter added to a Type/Length/Value (TLV)<br>
Encoding parameter of the RNG-RSP message is shown below in Table 4.<br><br><br>
Referring to Table 4, the SLPIDUpdate parameter includes<br>
Old-New-SLPID in which an OLD SLPID currently allocated to the MS and a<br>
NEW SLPID to be newly allocated to the MS are stored in pair.<br>
As shown in Table 4, the SLPIDUpdate parameter, as it is a TLV<br>
Encoding type parameter, is transmitted to the MS through the RNG-RSP<br>
message only when necessary. That is, the BS transmits the SLPID_Update<br>
parameter to the MS through the RNG-RSP message at the time where the<br>
periodic ranging is completed, only when it detects the need to update the SLPID<br>
of the MS.<br>
FIG. 3 is a flowchart illustrating an SLPID update process performed in<br>
an MS in a periodic ranging operation between a BS and the MS in the sleep<br>
mode in a communication system according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention. Referring to FIG. 3, an MS stays in a sleep mode in step 301. That is,<br>
the MS stays in the state where it is allocated an initial SLPID from the BS and<br>
transmits no data in the sleep mode. In step 303, the MS determines if it is time to<br>
perform a periodic ranging process with the BS. If it is not time to perform the<br>
periodic ranging process, the MS continuously maintains the sleep mode.<br>
However, if it is time to perform the periodic ranging process, the MS transmits<br>
an RNG-REQ message to the BS for ranging request in step 305. Subsequently, in<br>
step 307, the MS receives an RNG-RSP message from the BS in response to the<br>
ranging request.<br>
In step 309, the MS determines if there is an SLPIDUpdate parameter<br>
included in the RNG-RSP message received from the BS to determine whether its<br>
own SLPID is updated. If there is an SLPID_Update parameter included in the<br>
RNG-RSP message received from the BS, the MS updates its own SLPID with<br>
the SLPID newly allocated by the BS according to the parameter information in<br>
step 311, and then returns to step 301, transitioning back to the sleep mode.<br>
However, if it is determined in step 309 that if there is no SLPID_Update<br>
parameter included in the RN-RSP message received from the BS, the MS<br>
maintains the old SLPID currently allocated thereto and returns to step 301 to<br>
transition back to the sleep mode. The sleep mode in step 301 has a concept<br>
including one or both the sleep interval or the listening interval.<br>
Second Embodiment<br>
The SLPID update method according to the second embodiment of the<br><br>
present invention is characterized by updating an SLPID using a TRF-IND<br>
message in a listening interval of the sleep mode. The SLPID update method<br>
using the TRF-IND message according to the second embodiment of the present<br>
invention will now be described with reference to FIGs. 4, 5A and 5B.<br>
FIG. 4 is a flowchart illustrating a BS operation of updating an SLPID of<br>
an MS through a TRF-IND message in a communication system according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 4, at step 401, a<br>
transmission time of a TRF-IND message occurs. In step 403, a BS determines if<br>
there is an MS requiring an SLPID update, for at least one MS not required to<br>
transition to the awake mode among the MSs in the listening interval of the sleep<br>
mode. That is, the BS determines if there is a need to update an SLPID for an MS<br>
that will continuously maintain the sleep mode. The process of determining if<br>
there is a need to update an SLPID is achieved by determining if there is any<br>
empty SLPID in a list of SLPIDs with a number less than that of the current<br>
SLPID of the MS in the total SLPID list managed in the BS. The empty SLPID<br>
can correspond to an SLPID returned to the BS when another MS using the<br>
SLPID previously allocated from the BS makes a mode change to the awake<br>
mode. If there are a plurality of newly allocable empty SLPIDs, it is preferable to<br>
newly allocate and update the least SLPID among the empty SLPIDs. In this<br>
manner, an SLPID of the MS can be continuously updated with a smaller SLPID<br>
rather than being fixed to the initially allocated SLPID.<br>
For example, assuming that the lowest SLPID that the BS can allocate to<br>
the MS in the sleep mode is an SLPID#1 and an SLPID initially allocated to the<br>
MS is an SLPID#99, if there are unused SLPIDs between the SLPID#1 and the<br>
current SLPID#99 for the MS that has transmitted the RNG-REQ message, the<br>
BS can newly allocate the least one of the empty SLPIDs to the MS.<br>
If it is determined in step 403 that there is an MS requiring SLPID update,<br>
i.e., if the BS determines that there is an MS requiring SLPID update while<br>
maintaining the sleep state for at least one MS in the listening interval, the BS<br>
creates a TRF-IND message including information on a new SLPID to be<br>
allocated to the MS requiring SLPID update, i.e., information used for updating<br>
the SLPID of the MS in step 405. More specifically, the BS creates the TRF-IND<br>
message by adding information on the SLPID currently used for the MS and<br>
information on the SLPID to be newly allocated to the MS to an SLPID_Update<br>
field of the TRF-IND message.<br><br>
In step 407, the BS creates an SLPID bitmap of the TRF-IND message by<br>
setting a traffic indicator of the TRF-IND message for the MS requiring SLPID<br>
update to a negative indicator (bit=0) and setting an SLPID update indicator to a<br>
positive indicator (bit=l).<br>
If it is determined in step 403 that there is no MS requiring SLPID update,<br>
in step 407, the BS creates the SLPID bitmap of the TRF-IND message by setting<br>
the traffic indicator to 0 (negative indicator) and the SLPID update indicator to 0<br>
(negative indicator) for the MS that has no data traffic to transmit and does not<br>
require SLPID update. Although the SLPID update is not required for the MSs, if<br>
there is data traffic to transmit, the BS creates the SLPID bitmap of the TRF-IND<br>
message by setting the traffic indicator to 1 (positive indicator) for the<br>
corresponding MS.<br>
After creating the SLPID bitmap, the BS broadcasts the TRF-IND<br>
message including the SLPID bitmap in step 409.<br>
A format of the modified TRF-IND message broadcasted by the BS in<br>
step 409 is shown below in Table 5.<br><br><br><br>
As shown in Table 5, the SLPID bitmap information of the TRF-IND<br>
message includes bit information indicating the presence/absence of data traffic to<br>
be transmitted to the MS and bit information indicating whether to update the<br>
SLPID allocated to the MS. Of the two bits of the SLPID bitmap, the first bit is a<br>
traffic indicator indicating the presence/absence of traffic, and the lsecond bit is<br>
an SLPID update indicator indicating the presence/absence of SLPID update. For<br>
example, if SLPID bitmap information for the MS is '00', it indicates that there is<br>
no data traffic to be transmitted to the MS and there is no need to update an<br>
SLPID of the MS. If SLPID bitmap information for the MS is '01', it indicates<br>
that there is no data traffic to be transmitted to the MS and there is a need to<br>
update an SLPID of the MS. Therefore, the MS must read SLPID_Update<br>
information included in TLV of the TEF-IND message and detect an SLPID<br>
newly allocated thereto. If SLPID bitmap information for the MS is '10', it<br>
indicates that there is data traffic to be transmitted to the MS. Therefore, the MS<br>
indicates the necessity to make a mode change to the awake mode. In addition,<br>
because the SLPID update process is not necessary for an MS having<br>
transmission data traffic, if the first one bit of the SLPID bitmap is set to 1, the<br>
MS must transition to the awake mode, regardless of a value of the last one bit.<br>
Although the TRF-IND message according to the present invention has<br>
shown and described with reference to an embodiment thereof, it is not limited to<br>
the foregoing description. For example, according to another embodiment of the<br>
present invention, the TRF-IND message can be created with 1 bit. In this case,<br>
the TRF-IND message indicates only the presence/absence of data traffic to be<br>
transmitted to the MS. If there is no data traffic, the MS reads an SLPID_Update<br>
TLV included in the received TRF-IND message, and determines whether there is<br>
SLPID information,corresponding thereto, performing SLPID update.<br><br>
When an SLPID update indicator of the TRF-IND message is set to a<br>
positive indicator, an SLPIDUpdate parameter is added to the TLV Encoding<br>
parameter of the TRF-IND message as is shown below in Table 6.<br><br>
Referring to Table 6, the SLPID_Update parameter includes<br>
01d_New_SLPID in which an OLD SLPID currently allocated to the MS and a<br>
NEW SLPID to be newly allocated to the MS are stored in pair. Because the TRF-<br>
IND message including the SLPID_Update parameter is transmitted on a<br>
broadcast basis, the TRF-IND message can include as many SLPIDs currently<br>
used by the MS and SLPIDs to be newly allocated to the MS as the number of<br>
MSs requiring SLPID update.<br>
FIGs. 5A and 5B are flowcharts illustrating an MS operation of<br>
performing SLPID update through a TRF-IND message in a communication<br>
system according to an embodiment of the present invention. More specifically,<br>
FIG. 5 A illustrates an exemplary MS operation for a 2-bit TRF-IND message, and<br>
FIG. 5B illustrates an exemplary MS operation for a 1-bit TRF-IND message.<br>
That is, FIGs. 5A and 5B illustrate an SLPID update operation of the MS in the<br>
case where an SLPID update indicator of the MS in a TRF-IND message received<br>
in a listening interval of the sleep mode is set to 1 in a communication system<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5A, an MS in the sleep mode currently stays in the<br>
listening interval in step 501. For the listening interval, the MS receives a TRF-<br>
IND message shown in Table 5 in step 503.<br>
The MS, after receiving the TRF-IND message for the listening interval,<br><br>
analyzes information on an SLPID bitmap of the received TRF-IND message.<br>
That is, the MS checks the presence/absence of data traffic transmitted thereto<br>
and the necessity to update an old SLPID allocated thereto, based on the SLPID<br>
bitmap information of the received TRF-IND message. More specifically, the MS<br>
checks a bit value corresponding to a traffic indicator therefor in the SLPID<br>
bitmap of the TRF-IND message in step 505.<br>
If the traffic indicator value for the MS is set to 1, the MS enters the<br>
awake mode, recognizing the presence of data traffic to be transmitted thereto,<br>
and performs a traffic transmission/reception process with the BS in step 507.<br>
However, if the traffic indicator value is not set to 1, indicating the absence of<br>
data traffic to be transmitted to the MS, then the MS checks in step 509 if there is<br>
an SLPID to be newly allocated thereto, by analyzing an SLPID update indicator<br>
value of the TRF-IND message.	<br>
If the SLPID update indicator value is set to 1, the MS reads an<br>
SLPID_Update TLV included in the TRF-IND message received in step 503, and<br>
acquires information on an SLPID newly allocated thereto in step 511.<br>
Because the SLPID_Update TLV occasionally includes SLPID<br>
information for more than one MS, the MS reads a value for the first 10 bits from<br>
an O1d_New_SLPID of the SLPID_Update TLV to detect information being<br>
coincident with its current SLPID in step 511. As a result of the detection, if the<br>
MS detects an 01d_New_SLPID being coincident with its current SLPID, the MS<br>
recognizes the last 10 bits of the OldNewSLPID as an SLPID newly allocated<br>
thereto. Subsequently, the MS updates its own SLPID according to the SLPID<br>
allocated to the last 10 bits of the OldNewSLPID.<br>
In step 513, the MS enters the sleep mode after updating the SLPID.<br>
If it is determined in step 509 that the SLPID update indicator value is not<br>
set to 1, the MS maintains its current SLPID and stays in the sleep mode, in step<br>
513, recognizing the non-necessity to update the SLPID.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5B, an exemplary MS operation for a 1-bit TRF-IND<br>
message received from a BS, because steps 502 through 508 of FIG. 5B are equal<br>
to the steps 501' through 507 in operation, a detailed description thereof will be<br>
omitted. However, FIG. 5B is different from FIG 5A in that the TRF-IND<br><br>
message received from the BS has a 1-bit value. Therefore, the process of FIG. 5B<br>
is the same as that of FIG. 5A except that the TRF-IND message has a 1-bit value.<br>
As the received TRF-IND message has a 1-bit value, step 510 of FIG. 5B is<br>
different from step 509 of FIG. 5A in operation.<br>
That is, if it is determined in step 506 that the traffic indicator value is not<br>
set to 1, indicating the absence of data traffic to be transmitted to the MS, the MS<br>
reads SLPID_Update information included in a TRF-IND message received from<br>
the BS in the form of TLV, and determines whether there is an SLPID newly<br>
allocated thereto, in step 510. If there is an SLPID newly allocated thereto in the<br>
SLPID_Update TLV, the MS updates its SLPID with the new SLPID in step 512.<br>
Because the SLPIDJUpdate TLV occasionally includes SLPID<br>
information for more than one MS, the MS reads a value for the first 10 bits from<br>
the 01d_New_SLPID of the SLPIDJJpdate TLV, and detects information<br>
matching its current SLPID. If the MS detects an 01d_New_SLPID<br>
corresponding to its current SLPID, the MS updates the SLPID newly allocated<br>
thereto with the last 10 bits of the OldNewSLPID, and then enters the sleep<br>
mode, in step 514. Upon failure to detect SLPID information corresponding to the<br>
MS, the MS remains in the sleep mode in step 514, thereby maintaining its<br>
current SLPID.<br>
Third Embodiment<br>
The SLPID update method according to the third embodiment of the<br>
present invention is characterized by updating an SLPID using an unsolicited<br>
SLP-RSP message in a listening interval of a sleep mode. With reference to FIGs.<br>
6 and 7, a description will now be made of an SLPID update method using an<br>
unsolicited SLP-RSP message according to the third embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
FIG. 6 is a flowchart illustrating a BS operation of updating an SLPID of<br>
an MS using an unsolicited SLP-RSP message in a listening interval of a sleep<br>
mode in a communication system according to the third embodiment of the<br>
present invention. Referring to FIG. 6, a BS determines in step 601 whether there<br>
is a need for SLPID update for MSs staying in the listening interval of the sleep<br>
mode. It is assumed herein that the least SLPID number that the BS can allocate<br>
to an MS staying in a listening interval of the sleep mode is an SLPID#1. In this<br>
case, the process of determining in step 601 whether there is a need for SLPID<br><br>
update for MSs staying in the listening interval of the sleep mode is achieved in<br>
the following manner. The BS determines whether there is any unallocated SLPID,<br>
i.e., any empty SLPID, between an SLPID currently allocated to the MS in the<br>
listening interval of the sleep mode and the SLPID#1, and if there is an empty<br>
SLPID, the BS determines that there is a need to update an SLPID of the MS.<br>
If it is determined in step 601 that there is a need for SLPID update for a<br>
particular MS, the BS determines, as an SLPID to be newly allocated to the MS,<br>
an SLPID with the least number among the unused empty SLPIDs between the<br>
SLPID allocated to the MS and the least SLPID allocable by the BS. In step 603,<br>
the BS sets a Sleep-Approved value in the SLP-RSP message to 1, defines<br>
interval information of the SLP-RSP message, i.e., Start Frame value, Initial-<br>
Sleep Window value, Final-Sleep Window value, and Listening Interval<br>
information, as interval information currently used by the MS, and stores the<br>
interval information together with the newly determined SLPID information in<br>
the SLP-RSP message.<br>
In step 605, the BS transmits a SLP-RSP message including the SLPID<br>
newly allocated to the MS and the interval nformation, to the corresponding MS.<br>
FIG. 7 is a flowchart illustrating an MS operation of performing SLPID<br>
update using a unsolicited SLP-RSP message in a listening interval of the sleep<br>
mode in a communication system according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention. Referring to FIG. 7, an MS stays in a listening interval of the sleep<br>
mode in step 701, and receives an SLP-RSP message from a BS in step 703.<br>
Upon receiving the SLP-RSP message from the BS, the MS analyzes an SLPID<br>
included in the SLP-RSP message. If the MS detects the necessity to update the<br>
SLPID allocated thereto through the SLP-RSP message, the MS updates its own<br>
SLPID with the SLPID in the SLP-RSP message in step 705. The other interval<br>
information except for the SLPID is disregarded.<br>
The SLP-RSP message used for instructing SLPID update as illustrated in<br>
FIGs. 6 and 7 includes the interval information for the sleep mode operation of<br>
the MS in addition to the SLPID infomation. The interval information is<br>
unnecessary for an MS in the sleep mode. Therefore, the present invention<br>
proposes a format of a new SLP-RSP message not including the unnecessary<br>
interval information. A format of the modified SLP-RSP message according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention is shown below in Table 7.<br><br><br><br><br>
As shown in Table 7, the proposed SLP-RSP message includes an<br>
SLPID_Update field used for determining whether the SLP-RSP message is a<br>
message transmitted for an SLPID update operation or a message transmitted to<br>
indicate SLPID and interval information to be used in the sleep mode operation<br>
performed when starting the existing sleep mode operation. For a SLP-RSP<br>
message transmitted to start the sleep mode operation of the MS, the BS sets the<br>
SLPID_Update field value to 0, and stores start time of the sleep mode operation,<br>
initial-window size, final-window size, listening interval, and SLPID information.<br>
When there is a need to update an SLPID of the MS during a sleep mode<br>
operation with the MS, i.e., when the SLP-RSP message is a message transmitted<br>
to inform the MS of a new SLPID, the BS sets the SLPID_Update field value to 1<br>
and stores information on only an SLPID to be newly allocated.<br>
The SLP-RSP message shown in Table 7 can be created such that it<br>
includes interval information necessary for the sleep mode operation in addition<br>
to the SLPID in the form of TLV of the SLP-RSP message. In this case, when the<br>
MS and the BS perform a sleep mode entry negotiation process using the<br>
modified SLP-RSP message, the SLP-RSP message can be created such that it<br>
includes Interval_Info TLV, i.e., start time of the sleep mode operation, initial-<br>
window size, final-window size, and listening interval.<br>
Therefore, when the SLP-RSP message is use used to give instructions to<br>
update an SLPID of the MS, the BS performs an SLPID update operation by<br>
transmitting the SLP-RSP message without the interval information such as the<br>
Interval-Info TLV to the MS. When the SLP-RSP message is used to give<br>
instructions to perform a sleep mode operation, the BS transmits the SLP-RSP<br>
message with the interval information such as the Interval-Info TLV to the MS.<br>
Fourth Embodiment<br>
FIG. 8 is a flowchart illustrating a BS operation for updating an SLPID of<br>
an MS using a modified SLP-RSP message in a listening interval of a sleep mode<br>
in a communication system according to another embodiment of the present<br>
invention. Referring to FIG. 8, if it is time to transmit a TRF-IND message (step<br>
801), a BS selects an MS not requiring to enter the awake mode among the MSs<br>
in the listening interval of the sleep mode, i.e., selects an MS not requiring to<br><br>
perform SLPID update among the MSs having no traffic to transmit, in step 803.<br>
The process of determining the necessity to update the SLPID has been described<br>
above.<br>
Next, the BS must enable the MS in the sleep mode to transition to the<br>
awake mode in order to send a SLP-RSP message for SLPID update to the MS.<br>
Therefore, the BS sets a traffic indicator corresponding to the MS in the SLPID<br>
bitmap of the TRF-IND message to 1 in step 805. Thereafter, in step 807, the BS<br>
sets a Sleep-Approved field value of the SLP-RSP message to 1 in order to inform<br>
the MS of the SLPID update, and transmits the SLP-RSP message with the newly<br>
allocated SLPID information stored therein, to the MS.<br>
FIG. 9 is a flowchart illustrating an MS operation of performing SLPID<br>
update by receiving a modified SLP-RSP message in a listening interval of the<br>
sleep mode in a communication system according to an embodiment of the<br>
present invention. Referring to FIG. 9, an MS staying in a listening interval of the<br>
sleep mode (step 901) receives a TRF-IND message from a BS in step 903. In<br>
step 905, the MS checks the TRF-IND message received from the BS to<br>
determine if its own traffic indicator is set to 1. If its traffic indicator is not set to<br>
1, i.e., is set to a negative indicator, the MS enters the sleep mode, recognizing the<br>
absence of data traffic to be transmitted thereto, in step 917. However, if its traffic<br>
indicator in the TRF-IND message is set to 1, i.e., is set to a positive indicator, the<br>
MS transitions to the awake mode to temporarily wake up from the sleep mode,<br>
recognizing the presence of data traffic to be transmitted thereto, in step 907.<br>
Upon receiving an SLP-RSP message from the BS in the awake mode in<br>
step 909, the MS checks a bit value of an SLPID_Update field of the SLP-RSP<br>
message in step 911. If no SLP-RSP message is received from the BS in the<br>
awake mode, the MS waits for the reception of transmission data traffic in the<br>
awake mode.<br>
If the SLPID_Update field is set to 1, the MS updates its current SLPID<br>
with a new SLPID included in the SLP-RSP message in step 915, recognizing the<br>
necessity to update its own SLPID. Subsequently, in step 917, the MS enters the<br>
sleep mode after the SLPID update.<br>
However, if it is determined in step 911 that the SLPID_Update field is<br>
not set to 1, the MS acquires interval information necessary for the sleep mode<br><br>
operation and information on an SLPID allocated thereto in step 913, recognizing<br>
a new start of the sleep mode operation. Thereafter, in step 917, the MS enters the<br>
sleep mode.<br>
As described above, the novel BWA communication system can update<br>
an SLPID allocated to an MS in a sleep mode. As the communication system<br>
supporting the sleep mode can update an SLPID allocated to the MS in the sleep<br>
mode, it can reduce a size of an SLPID bitmap, contributing to a reduction in the<br>
processing time required for reading and processing the SLPID bitmap. That is,<br>
the communication system enables an SLPID allocated to the MS in the sleep<br>
mode to be updated even in the sleep mode rather than being fixed, reducing the<br>
number of SLPID bitmaps to be processed by the MS in the sleep mode state. As<br>
a result, the novel process of processing a TRF-IND message by the MS in the<br>
sleep mode is more effective than the conventional process.<br>
While the present invention has been shown and described with reference<br>
to certain exemplary embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled<br>

ABSTRACT<br>
TITLE : A METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR UPDATING A SLEEP IDENTIFIER OF A<br>
MOBILE STATION IN A BROADBAND WIRELESS ACCESS COMMUNICATION<br>
SYSTEM<br>
The invention relates to a method and system for updating a sleep identifier<br>
(SLPID) of a mobile station (MS) in a broadband wireless access (BWA)<br>
communication system having a sleep mode in which there is no transmission<br>
data and an awake mode in which there is transmission data. Upon recognizing a<br>
need to update an SLPID allocated to an MS in the sleep mode in the initial<br>
phase of the sleep mode, a base station (BS) reallocates a new SLPID to be<br>
allocated to the MS and transmits SLPID update information to the MS. Upon<br>
receiving the SLPID update information for its current SLPID during the sleep<br>
mode, the MS updates its current SLPID with the reallocated SLPID according to<br>
the received update information.<br>
