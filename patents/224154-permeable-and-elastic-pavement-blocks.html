				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to permeable and elastic pavement blocks<br>
comprising waste-polyurethanc chips. These blocks use a binder specially developed to<br>
secure the binding between an upper polyurethane-chip layer and a lower permeable-<br>
concrete layer as well as the binding among the wastc-polyurethane chips, resulting in<br>
excellent strength and durability, and use recycled waste-polyurethane chips to provide<br>
elasticity and permeability suitable for sports activities, walking, outdoor exercises and<br>
the like.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
As for conventional blocks for pavement, there are general pavement blocks<br>
prepared by mixing aggregates such as rubble sand and cement in appropriate portions,<br>
casting the mixture into a mold, and curing; and rubber blocks prepared by mixing<br>
waste-tire chips and/or waste-rubber chips with adhesives and pigments, and molding in<br>
a predetermined block shape.<br>
However, these conventional blocks for pavement were not permeable. Thus,<br>
in case of heavy rain, except for only some part of the rain permeating through crevices<br>
among blocks, most of the rain did not sink into the ground, but flowed through<br>
roadside drainage system to river, stream, waste-water treatment plant or public water<br>
area. Therefore, in case of a localized torrential downpour for a short period of time or a<br>
heavy rain for a long period of time during the rainy season, the drained rain and water<br>
may overflow the river and stream, causing very dangerous and unstable situation. Also,<br>
as the rain and water could not permeate into the conventional pavement blocks, it<br>
obstructed safe passage and caused a lot of inconvenience to pedestrians.<br>
In order to overcome such disadvantages of the conventional pavement<br>
blocks, permeable and drainage pavement blocks have been developed, among which<br>
Korean Utility Model Registration No. 195525 registered on June 29, 2000 entitled<br>
"permeable blocks" discloses blocks for pavement or driveway. In this utility model, in<br>
order to facilitate the permeation of rain or water, each of the blocks includes grooves<br>
on side and top surfaces thereof to perforate through the top surface and the bottom<br>
surface of the block.<br>
Further, Korean Utility Model Registration No. 248505 registered on<br>
September 17.2001 entitled "pavement blocks with draining function" discloses<br>
drainage pavement blocks used for parking lots or sidewalks, each of which includes a<br>
central hollow space and overflows in the center of the top and side surfaces thereof,<br>
and each of which is filled with permeable concrete in the central hollow space and the<br>
overflows.<br>
Meanwhile, in order to overcome disadvantages of conventional<br>
impermeable pavement blocks, to prevent earth and sand's washing away from a slope<br>
of a dike, and to secure underground water resources by inducing rain or water to the<br>
ground, Korean Patent No. 165047 patented on September 15, 1998 discloses<br>
permcablo pavement blocks, which have the permeability coefficient of 10x10-4 cm/sec<br>
and the porosity of 5-10% and comprise 102 parts by weight of water, 410 parts by<br>
weight of cement, 100 parts by weight of sand, 1685 parts by weight of short particle<br>
aggregates (5-10mm diameter), 1.8 parts by weight of a retardant, and 1.0 part by<br>
weight of resin.<br>
In addition, Korean Utility Model Registration No, 289645 registered on<br>
September 4, 2002 discloses "permeable concrete blocks with a waste-lire chip layer',<br>
comprising a lower permeable-concrete layer prepared by mixing aggregates having the<br>
size of 13mm or less, cement, water and admixture products in predetermined ratios;<br>
and an upper wa9te-tirc chip layer provided in the thickness of )10-20mm by mixing<br>
100g of waste-tire chips of 13mm or less, 7-21g of a binder, and 1-5g of an inorganic<br>
pigment.<br>
The permeable concrete blocks as disclosed in the above utility model had<br>
bi-directional permeability allowing rain or water to penetrate into the ground and to<br>
evaporate into the earth's surface, so that trees and plants could be provided with<br>
life-giving water and flooding of the river could be prevented. Also, by using recycled,<br>
waste tires which have been one of the environmental pollutants, the blocks did not only<br>
absorb impact on foot, but also contributed to the protection of environment and<br>
mobility of old and feeble people.<br>
However, since the waste tire's smell of rubber lasted for a long time, the<br>
blocks using the waste tire could not provide a pleasant sense of smell. Further, sinco<br>
the urothane, epoxy and acrylic resin binders used to adhere the waste-tire chips were<br>
those available in the market, there have been demands for a binder which enhances the<br>
adhesive strength and maintains the strength and durability of the blocks for a Jong time.<br>
Further, conventional pavement blocks using waste-tire chips or rubber had<br>
disadvantages in that, upon exposure to the high temperature heat of the sun rays during<br>
summer, the surface temperature of the blocks abruptly increases and the elastic<br>
waste-tire chip layer is separated from or comes off the lower supporting layer, Also,<br>
during the pavement construction, it was inconvenient to fill the space formed between<br>
neighboring permeable blocks with sand and the like.<br>
Accordingly, the inventor of the present invention studied and researched<br>
into materials and binders for the permeable pavement blocks, and as a result, the<br>
inventor completed the present invention by using wastc-polyurethane chips in place of<br>
waste-tire chips as amain component of the permeable elastic pavement blocks and<br>
developed a binder to secure the binding between an upper polyurethane-chip layer and<br>
a lower permeable-concrete layer as well as the binding among the wastc-polyurethane<br>
chips.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide permeable and elastic<br>
pavement blocks, which use waste-polyurethane chips obtained from soles of shoes,<br>
parts of toys, parts of refrigerators, parts of vehicles, and decrepit recycled-polyurethane<br>
resilient pavement to solve the smelling problem of waste tires, purse resources and<br>
prevent environmental pollution, and to provide comfort and shock absorption in<br>
walking as well.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide permeable and clastic<br>
pavement blocks, which use a binder specially developed to secure the binding between<br>
an upper polyurethane-chip layer and a lower permeable-concrete layer as well as the<br>
binding among the waste-polyurethane chips, resulting in excellent strength and<br>
durability.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide permeable and elastic<br>
pavement blocks, which comprise an upper polyurethane-chip layer and a lower<br>
permeable-concrete layer, to allow rain or water to seep into the ground!, thus providing<br>
safer walking, jogging or driving conditions and comfortable vision, and also preventing<br>
flooding of the river due to heavy rain.<br>
In order to achieve the above objects, the present invention provides permeable and<br>
elastic pavement blocks comprising a permeable concrete layer consisting of aggregates of<br>
the size in the range of 5-13mm, cement, water and admixture products ; a primer layer; and<br>
an elastic layer from the bottom to the top,<br>
wherein the permeable concrete layer has the compressive strength of 100 kg/cm2 or<br>
more and the permeability coefficient of 1x10-3 cm/sec or more ;<br>
the primer layer comprises 10-20 % by weight of polypropylene glycol (PPG), 5-10 %<br>
by weight of trimethylol propane (TMP), 5-10% by weight of 1,3-butylene glycol (1,3-BG), 15-<br>
25 % by weight of toluene diisocyanate (TDI), 49-64.9% by weight of a solvent, and 0.1-1.0%<br>
by weight of an additive ; and<br>
the elastic layer comprises waste-polyurethane chips and a binder in the weight ratio<br>
of 3:1 to 5:1, the waste-polyurethane chips having the size of 1 to 5 mm and the binder<br>
comprising 50-70% by weight of PPG, 5-10% by weight of PBG (polybutadiene glycol), 3-5%<br>
by weight of 1,3-BG, 20-30 % by weight of MDI (methylene diisocyanate) and 2-5% by<br>
weight of TDI.<br>
Solvents that can be used are for e.g., xylene and methylethylketone. The additive<br>
may be a defoaming agent such as a combination of 1% by weight of polysiloxane solution<br>
and 99% by weight of diisobutyl ketone.<br>
It is preferable that the upper elastic layer should be formed to be 1-2mm larger than<br>
the lower permeable-concrete layer.<br>
With the permeable and elastic pavement blocks according to the present<br>
invention, there is no separation of the upper elastic layer from the lower permeable<br>
concrete layer and no separation from the lower layer due to expansion of the upper<br>
elastic layer, which have been observed for the conventional waste-tire blocks or rubber<br>
blocks upon exposure to the high-temperature environment of summer.<br>
Further, the permeable and clastic pavement blocks according to the present<br>
invention can just be provided on anyplace, without filling between neighboring blocks<br>
with sand and the like.<br>
The permeable and elastic pavement blocks according to the present<br>
invention are manufactured by the steps of pouring permeable concrete into a mold;<br>
curing preliminarily by the supply of heat and pressure to form the permeable concrete<br>
layer; coating the permeable concrete layer with the primer layer; spreading the elastic<br>
layer comprising waste-polyurethanc chips; and then pressurizing and curing the clastic<br>
layer.<br>
Since use of excessive pressure in pressurizing the elastic layer can clog up<br>
the pores and reduce the permeability of the blocks, it is preferable to use an appropriate<br>
pressure. Upon hardening, the block is removed from the mold for natural curing.<br>
The wastc-polyurethanc chips used in the present invention arc obtained by<br>
collecting waste-polyurctbane scraps from soles of shoes, parts of toys, parts of<br>
refrigerators, parts of vehicles, decrepit polyurethane resilient pavcment, etc. and<br>
separating the scraps according to their colors; removing impurities attached on the<br>
scraps; pulverizing the waste-polyurethanc scraps in a predetermined size; adding<br>
0.3-1.0kg of stearic acid, 20-30kg of heavy calcium carbonate, 0.1-2.0kg of titanium<br>
dioxide as a decolorant and white pigment and 5kg or less of a pigment, based on 100kg<br>
of the pulverized waste-polyurethanc scraps and mixing them by stirring; heating and<br>
extruding the mixture; and then condensing and cutting the extruded mixture into a<br>
predetermined size.<br>
In the present invention, a photoluminescent pigment, which emits light at<br>
night (darkness) or in case of rain by using the energy that has been accumulated during the<br>
daytime, can be used as the pigment, and zinc sulfide compounds can be used for this<br>
purpose. In this case, the amount of the photoluminescent pigment used is 20-40% by<br>
weight of the scraps.<br>
For instance, waste-polyurethane chips made by using the photoluminescent pigment<br>
can be prepared separately from the chips made by using a normal pigment in a<br>
predetermined ratio, and they can be mixed with the binder respectively to form permeable<br>
and elastic blocks, so that the blocks can be respectively distributed and arranged in their<br>
respective positions that have been designed previously,<br>
If a flame retarding property is required in preparing the waste-polyurethane chips, a<br>
flame retardant such as melamine polyphosphate in the range of 1-2% of the scraps by<br>
weight can be added to the mixture.<br>
Further, depending on usages of the permeable and elastic pavement blocks of the<br>
present invention, a foaming agent, such as sodium hydrogen carbonate, can be used to<br>
adjust the hardness of the waste-polyurethane chips. For example, the waste-polyurethane<br>
chips made by using a relatively large amount of the foaming agent can be used in blocks for<br>
sidewalks and trails, while the relatively hard polyurethane chips made by using less amount<br>
of the foaming agent can be used in blocks for bicycle paths and tracks for in-line skating.<br>
The size of the waste-polyurethane chips can vary according to their usage, e.g. In 1-<br>
2 mm, 2-3 mm, 3-4 mm, 1-5 mm, etc. Smaller ones can be used for bicycle paths and tracks<br>
for in-line skating, and larger ones for sidewalks and trails.<br>
The waste-polyurethane chips in the elastic layer can be replaced in part or entirely<br>
with new polyurethane chips. The new polyurethane chips are prepared by mixing 1 part by<br>
weight of liquid polyurethane with 0.5-1.2 parts by weight of heavy calcium carbonate, and<br>
0.01 part by weight or less of a pigment, such as, iron oxide (as red oxide pigment),<br>
chromium oxide (as green pigment) and pthalocyanine (as organic pigment) or 0.1-0.4 parts<br>
by weight of a photoluminescent pigment by stirring ; pouring the mixture in a mold and<br>
curing in a sheet form ; and then cutting the polyurethane sheet and pulverizing into a<br>
predetermined size. The new polyurethane chips manufactured as such are very clear in<br>
color.<br>
In addition, the binder used in the present invention is to secure the binding between<br>
the elastic layer and the permeable concrete layer and also among the waste-polyurethane<br>
chips in the elastic layer. Usually, compounds having molecular weight of 1,000-5,000 and<br>
having more than two hydroxy groups (-OH) or multi-functional isocyanate compounds<br>
(-NCO) are used as the binder.<br>
For example, TDI and MDI are used as the chip binders. However, the adhesive<br>
property and the coefficient of expansion of the binders are variable depending on their<br>
molar ratio. Therefore, the inventor of the present invention developed a binder suitable for<br>
achieving the objects of the invention and having the elasticity and the coefficient of<br>
expansion similar to those of the polyurethane chips to provide excellent adhesive property<br>
among the chips. This specially developed binder according to the present invention<br>
comprises 50-70% by weight of PPG, 5-10% by weight of PBG, 3-5% by weight of 1,3-BG,<br>
20-30% by weight of MDI and 2-5% by weight of TDI, wherein PPG is to provide toughness<br>
and 1,3-BG is used as a chain extender to form a polymer having higher molecular weight<br>
than a simple compound produced by the reaction between PPG and MDI. The binder of the<br>
present invention, therefore, does not only have a high adhesiveness and coefficient of<br>
expansion, but also has tensile strength and pliability from a primary reaction with MDI and a<br>
secondary reaction with TDI.<br>
It is preferable that the polyurethane chips and the binder are blended in the<br>
weight ratio of 3:1 to 5:1. This is because use of the binder less than 15 % by weight<br>
results in poor adhesive property and use of more than 40% causes the pores to be<br>
clogged or the binder to be blown up during the curing step.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The principal of the present invention, will be described in more detail below<br>
with reference to the embodiments, but the scope of the invention, is. not limited wfthin<br>
the embodiments.<br>
1. Preparation of waste-polyurethane chips<br>
As a preliminary step, waste-polyurethane scraps were collected from soles<br>
of shoes, parts of toys, parts of refrigerators and vehicles, decrepit polyurethane resilient<br>
pavement, etc., and separated according to their colors. From the separated<br>
waste-polyurethane scraps, impurities stuck thereto were removed by cutting.<br>
Then, the waste-polyurethane scraps were pulverized in a crusher in the<br>
particle diameter of 3-30mm, and transported to a mixer.<br>
Based on 100kg of the pulverized waste-polyurethane scraps, 0.5kg of<br>
atearic acid, 25kg of heavy calcium carbonate, 0.2kg of titanium dioxide and 1.5kg of a<br>
pigment were added and mixed by stirring.<br>
Then, the mixture was transported through a conveyor to ari extruder where<br>
the mixture was extruded in the form of a plate.<br>
The extruded wastc-polyurethane was passed to a second crusher and a<br>
cutter to be cut in the particle size of l-5mm, resulting in the production of<br>
waste-polyurcthane chips.<br>
In this embodiment, if the flame retarding property is required, a flame<br>
retardant in the rango of 1-2% by weight of the scraps can be added to the mixture.<br>
2. Preparation of binder<br>
30kg of PPG and 5kg of PBG were prepared as polyol compounds. Also,<br>
13kg of MDI and 2kg of TDI as multi-functional isocyanate compounds and 2kg of<br>
1,3-BG as a chain extender were prepared.<br>
The above compounds were mixed with an accelerator and reacted to<br>
produce a binder having the following physical properties:<br>
3. Preparation of permeable and elastic pavement blocks<br>
[Embodiment 1]<br>
A concrete mixture was prepared by mixing aggregates of the size in. the<br>
range of 5-13mm, cement, water and admixture products, and this mixture was poured<br>
in each mold for blocks to form a permeable-concrete layer.<br>
Then, a primer composition prepared by mixing 5kg of PPG, 3kg of TMP,<br>
2kg of 1,3-BG, 7kg of TDI, 17kg of xylene as a solvent and 0.3kg of a defoaming agent<br>
was spread on the permeable concrete layer.<br>
In order to form an elastic layer above the permeable concrete layer, 100kg<br>
of the wastc-polyurethane chips having the size of 3 to 5mm and 30kg of the binder<br>
were blended.<br>
This mixture was poured onto the primer layer in the thickness of 10-20mm<br>
to be l-2mm larger than the lower permeable-concrete layer, and compacted with, a<br>
press heated to the temperature of about 800C. Then, the pavement in the mold was<br>
hardened and upon hardening, the block was removed from the mold for natural curing.<br>
The permeable and elastic pavement blocks obtained as such were arranged<br>
as previously designed for trails and sidewalks, and they had the strength and elasticity<br>
suitable for trails and sidewalks.<br>
[Embodiment 2]<br>
SOkg of the waste-polyurethane chips obtained from the above Embodiment<br>
1 were used together with 50kg of polyurethane chips prepared by using new<br>
polyurethane material to be blended with, the binder.<br>
The urethane chips using the new polyurethane material were prepared by<br>
mixing 50kg of liquid polyurcthanc with 35kg of heavy calcium carbonate and 0.5kg of<br>
a pigment in a high-speed stirrer of more than 1 ,000rpm, pouring and curing the mixture<br>
in a frame in the shape of a plato, and then pulverizing it into the size of 3-5mm.<br>
The other procedures were the aamo as in Embodiment 1, and as a result the<br>
permeable and elastic pavement blocks in much clear color were obtained.<br>
[Embodiment 3]<br>
As another embodiment to produce permeable and elastic pavement blocks<br>
suitable for walking, the waste-polyurethane chips having the size of 3 to 5ram on<br>
average were prepared by using a normal pigment and the chips having Ac same size<br>
were separately prepared by using a photoluminescent pigment (zinc sulfide), each of<br>
which were blended with the binder in the ratio of 4:1.<br>
The other procedures were the same as in Embodiment 1. <br>
The permeable and elastic blocks produced by using the normal pigment<br>
were arranged as previously designed, and the blocks using the photoluminescent<br>
pigment were also arranged according to a predetermined design.<br>
As described above, the permeable and elastic pavement blocks according to<br>
the present invention use waste-polyurethane chips obtained from soles of shoes, parts<br>
of toys, parts of refrigerators, parts of vehicles and decrepit rccyclcd-polyurcthane<br>
resilient pavement, so that the smelling and breaking apart problems encountered in<br>
using waste-tire chips ore solved, and they serve to nurse resources and prevent<br>
environmental pollution, and also provide comfort and shock absorption, in walking.<br>
Further, according to the present invention, the permeable and elastic<br>
pavement blocks use a binder specially developed to secure the binding between, the<br>
polyurethane chip layer and the permeable concrete layer as well as the binding among<br>
the waste-polyurethane chips, resulting in excellent strength and durability.<br>
Furthermore, the permeable and elastic pavement blocks according to the<br>
present invention, comprise an upper polyurethane-chip layer and a lower permeable-<br>
concrete layer, allowing rain or water to seep into the ground, thus providing safer<br>
walking, jogging or driving conditions and comfortable vision, and also preventing<br>
flooding of the river due to heavy rain.<br>
It will, be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and<br>
variations can be made to the present invention without departing from the spirit and<br>
