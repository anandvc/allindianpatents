COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See section 10, Rule 13]<br>
FOAMABLE SUSPENSION GEL;<br>
STIEFEL RESEARCH AUSTRALIA PTY LTD, A CORPORATION ORGANIZED AND EXISTING UNDER THE LAWS OF AUSTRALIA WHOSE ADDRESS IS 8 MACRO COURT WANTIRNA, VICTORIA 3152 AUSTRALIA.<br>
THE	FOLLOWING	SPECIFICATION<br>
PARTICULARLY	DESCRIBES	THE<br>
INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br><br><br><br>
This application claims priority to United States Provisional Application No.60/744,082 filed March 31, 2006, the contents of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present subject matter relates to topical delivery of at least one active agent that is sparingly soluble to insoluble in water, particularly benzoyl peroxide, in an aqueous, foamable suspension gel.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
There are many challenges in the topical application of pharmaceutically active agents. One major objective is to achieve percutaneous delivery of the active agent to the site of treatment. The composition should also have desirable cosmetic characteristics. Application should be easy and should not leave a noticeable residue on the surface of the skin. Moreover, the composition should not cause irritation, discomfort, or inconvenience.<br>
Many antifungal and antibacterial agents are used topically to treat epidermal infections. Some antibiotics, such as tetracycline and clindamycin, are also used to treat acne and other skin diseases that are caused, directly or indirectly, by bacteria. One of the side-effects of systemically administered clindamycin is colitis, which can be dangerous and even fatal. Thus, in treating acne, it is desirable to administer clindamycin topically. Cleocin T®, manufactured by Pharmacia-Upjohn, contains clindamycin phosphate, which is inactive in vitro, but is hydrolyzed in vivo to the antibacterially active clindamycin. Cleocin T® is currently available as a gel, a lotion, and a topical solution, and is used for topical treatment of acne vulgaris.<br>
2<br><br>
Others have produced topical formulations containing a pharmaceutically active agent that is sparingly soluble to insoluble in water {e.g., benzoyl peroxide) and a second pharmaceutically active agent {e.g., clindamycin). For example, BenzaClin , manufactured by Derrnik Laboratories, and Duac®, manufactured by Stiefel Laboratories, each contain benzoyl peroxide and clindamycin. BenzaClin® and Duac® are currently available as topical gels. Others have described a suspension foam containing benzoyl peroxide and clindamycin, but the foam contains oil and requires a surfactant in addition to a dispersing emulsifier. See, U.S. Patent Publication 2005/0186147.<br>
Lotion, gels and oil-based foams have the disadvantage of extended rub-in and may leave oily residues. The oil can also exacerbate acne. The solution form readily runs off the site of application, and therefore it is difficult to apply controlled amounts using the solution form.<br>
The present subject matter provides a composition having at least one pharmaceutically active compound, which is useful for topical administration as described herein, as a foamable suspension gel that is non-runny, easy to apply, and does not leave a noticeable residue. The present foamable gel composition provides good control of the application of a small amount of product to the desired area.<br>

practically insoluble or insoluble 1 in more than 10,000 Solubility ranges are available in published pharmacopoeias, including United States Pharmacopoeia (USP), European Phamiacopoeia (EP), British Pharmacopoeia (BP); and in Martindale: The Complete Drug Reference, Sweetman, 2004, Pharmaceutical Press., and in Martindale, Martindale: The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 31st Edition., 1996, Amer Pharmaceutical Assn, which is herein incorporated by reference.<br>
The term "treating" as used herein refers to the process of producing an effect on biological activity, function, health, or condition of an organism in which such activity is maintained, enhanced, diminished, or applied in a manner consistent with the general health and well-being of the organism.<br>
13<br><br>
The term "vehicle" as used herein refers to a composition which has only excipient or components required to carry an active agent, but which itself has no pharmaceutical or therapeutic effect,<br>
Other terms as used herein are meant to be defined by their well-known meanings in the art.<br>
Foamable Pharmaceutical Compositions<br>
The present subject matter provides simple and elegant foamable suspension gels that surprisingly maintain the chemical and physical stability of at least one active agent in a suspension that forms a homogenous foam. The foamabfe suspension gels are aqueous and optionally, alcohol-free and/or oil-free. The present suspension gels are foamable, break down with mechanical shear, but are not so-called alcoholic "Quick-break" foams.<br>
Moreover, the gel formulation in the can or container can be a post-foaming gel, which foams once released from the can. This innovative formulation provides extended shelf-life coupled with ease of application. For example, benzoyl peroxide is known to degrade clindamycin. However, the current foamable suspension gel formulation advantageously provides for both stability and ease of application.<br>
In some embodiments, the foamable suspension gel is oil-free. In this regard, the phrase "oil-free" as used herein refers to compositions containing less than 1 % by weight oil. In some embodiments, the foamable suspension gel is alcohol-free. In this regard, the phrase "alcohol-free" as used herein refers to compositions containing less than 1% by weight alcohol. Alcohol in this regard includes ethanoi, isopropanol, n-propanol, butanol, or any other short chain aliphatic alcohol. In some embodiments, the foamable suspension gel is oil-free and alcohol-free.<br>
a.	Components<br>
14<br><br>
Components of the present foamable suspension gels can comprise or consist of a first<br>
active agent sparingly soluble to insoluble in water, an aqueous phase, a thickening agent,<br>
and water. The foamable suspension gels can comprise a second active agent. Optionally, the<br>

.	Dispersing Agents/Wetting Ageltts<br>
Active agents that are sparingly soluble to insoluble in water (e.g are hydrophobic), can require a dispersing agent or wetting agent to coat tne surface of the hydrophobic particles there by lowering their surface tension . The disressing agent and the wetting agentt. can be the same agent or two or more different agents. A disPersin©'wetting agent can helP to maintain the hydrophobic particles in the formulation matrix and aidding in the distribution of the hydrophobic active agent upon the skin. U.S. Pattfnt No- 5,470,884 discusses the benefits of a dispersing/wetting agent with reference to formulations containing benzoyl peroxide.<br>
In some embodiments, the aqueous phase can comprises dispersing/wetting agent. The dispersing/wetting agent can be provided to facilitate the suspension of the first active agent in the aqueous phase. In some embodiments, the dispersing/wetting agent is a surfactant.<br>
In the foamable suspension gels of the present subject matter, active agents sparingly soluble to insoluble in water are suspended in the aqueous phase. Suspension can be facilitated by inclusion of a dispersing/wetting agent in the aqueous phase. The dispersing/wetting agent allows the sparingly soluble to insolllb,e active agent to be dispersed or wetted with water.<br>
The    dispersing/wetting    agents    can    have    surf"actant    properties.	Suitable<br>
dispersing/wetting agents break up the majority of the hydroPnobic particles of the active<br>
24<br><br>
agent sparingly soluble to insoluble in water into primary particle form and allow for. easy redispersion of settled particles.<br>
In some embodiments, the dispersing/wetting agent is a non-ionic surfactant. Exemplified dispersing/wetting agents for use in the present foamable suspension gels include sodium dioctyl sulfosuccinate, Brij®-30 (Laureth-4), Brij®~58 (Ceteth-20) and Brij®-78 (Steareth-20), Brij®-721 (Steareth-21), Crillet-l (Polysorbate 20), Crillet-2 (Polysorbate 40), Crillet-3 (Polysorbate 60), Crillet 45 (Polysorbate 80), Myrj-52 (PEG-40 Stearate), Myrj-53 (PEG-50 Stearate), Pluronic® F77 (Poloxamer 217), Pluronic® F87 (Poloxamer 237), Pluronic® F98 (Poloxamer 288), Pluronic® L62 (Poloxamer 182), Pluronic® L64 (Poloxamer 184), Pluronic® F68 (Poloxamer 188), Pluronic® L81 (Poloxamer 231), Pluronic® L92 (Poloxamer 282), Pluronic® L101 (Poloxamer 331), Pluronic® P103 (Poloxamer 333), Pluracare® -F 108 NF (Poloxamer 338), and Pluracare® F 127 NF (Poloxamer 407).

These surfactants can include, for example, polyoxyethylene fatty ethers, polyoxyethylene fatty esters, fatty acids, sulfated fatty acids, phosphated fatty acids, sulfosuccinates, amphoteric surfactants, non-ionic poloxamers, non-ionic meroxapols, petroleum derivatives, aliphatic amines, polysiloxane derivatives, sorbitan fatty acid esters, pharmaceutically acceptable sails thereof, and mixtures thereof. In particularly preferred embodiments in this regard, the surfactant can be selected from the group consisting of laureth-4, PEG-2 dilaurate, stearic acid, sodium lauryl sulfate, dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate, cocoamphopropionate,   poloxamer   188,   meroxapol   258,   triethanolamine,   dimethicone,<br>
25<br><br>
polysorbate  60,  sorbitan   monostearate,   pharmaceutically   acceptable  salts  thereof,   and mixtures thereof.<br>
Other surfactants commonly known as useful in the preparation of foamable compositions are further contemplated as within the scope of the present subject matter. These other surfactants include, for example, those listed in the CTFA Cosmetic Ingredient Dictionary, Second Edition, The Cosmetic Toiletry and Fragrance Association, Inc., 1133 Fifteenth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20005, 1977, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
The foamable suspension gels generally contain up to about 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, 5% (w/w) dispersing/wetting agent, for example in the range of 0.2-5%, 0.5-3%. In some embodiments, the foamable suspension gels contain about 0.2%, 0.5%, 0.8%, 1%, 1.5%, 2%, 2.5%, 3%, 4%, or 5% dispersing/wetting agent.<br>
In some embodiments, the dispersing/wetting agents possess surfactant properties, and the foaming suspension gels do not require an additional surfactant. Generally, inclusion of a surfactant is optional.<br>
In some embodiments, the thickening agent can be used as a dispersing agent in addition to a thickening agent. In such formulations, the foaming suspension gels do not require a distinct dispersing/wetting agent or an additional surfactant. Addition of a distinct dispersing/wetting agent or an additional surfactant is optional.<br>
A dispersing and/or wetting agent is not generally considered to be a foaming agent. In fact, foaming can be a disfavored attribute for these types of surfactants. Efficient wetting of a surface occurs when the cohesive forces between hydrophobic regions of adsorbed surfactant molecules are minimized. Cohesion between hydrophobic regions is minimized by increasing the size of the hydrophilic region(s) relative to the hydrophobic region(s) for a given wetting agent.   Similarly, decreasing the size of the hydrophobic region(s) relative to<br>
26<br><br>
the hydrophilic region(s) minimizes the cohesion between hydrophobic regions. For good<br>
foaming to occur, the cohesive forces between adsorbed surfactant molecules must be greater<br>
than the cohesive forces required for good wetting. Therefore a good wetting agent is<br>
typically considered a poor foaming agent and vice versa. See, page 218 of Schomfeldt,<br>
Surface Active Ethylene Oxide Adducts, 1969, Pergamon Press.<br>
iii.	Th tokening Agents<br>

The foamable suspension gels can contain about 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.3%, 0.4%, 0.5%, 0.6%, 0.8%, Q.9%, or 1.0% (w/w) of a buffering agent or a buffering pair.<br>
In some embodiments, the pH-adjusting agent is a buffering agent or a buffering pair, for example, an amino acid, a citrate buffer, a phosphate buffer, a bicarbonate buffer, a TRIS buffer, or aHEPES buffer. In some embodiments, the foamable suspension gel has a pH between about 3-9, about 4-9, about 4-6, or about 4-5.5. In some embodiments, the foamable suspension gel has a pH of about 4, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 4.7, 4.S, 4.9, 5, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3,<br>
29<br><br>
5.4 or 5.5.<br>
vi.	Antioxidants<br>
In some embodiments, the foamable suspension gels can comprise one or more antioxidants or free radical scavengers to maintain the desired physical and chemical properties. Suitable antioxidants do not themselves initiate the decomposition of an active agent, and are soluble in the present formulations. Exemplified antioxidants include oxygen, quinones, co-enzyme Q, polymerizable monomers, butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), ascorbic acid, ascorbyl palmitate, t-butyl hydroquinone, disodium ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), erythorbic acid, olive (olea eurpaea) oil, pentasodium penetetate, pentetic acid, propyl gallate, sodium ascorbate, sodium metabisulfite, sodium sulfite, tocopheryl, and tocopheryl acetate.<br>

Inclusion of an antioxidant is optional. In some embodiments, the foamable suspension gels are free of an antioxidant.<br>
vii.        Chehiling/Secjuesiering Agents<br>
Chelating and sequestering agents can aid in delaying the initiation of free radical formation with divalent trace metal cations. Including a chelating agent into the formulation can be advantageous in formulations that are packaged in a metal container. An exemplified chelating/sequestering agent is ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA).<br>
A chelating/ sequestering agent can be included at a concentration up to about 0.5%, more usually up to about 0.1% or 0.2% (w/w), for example, about 0.1%, 0.15%, 0.2%, 0.25%, 0.3%, 0.4%, or 0.5%.<br>

ix.        Solvents<br>
In certain optional embodiments, the foamable suspension gels of the present subject<br>
matter further comprise a volatile solvent, for example, an alcohol. Suitable alcohols include<br>
lower alkanols (C1-C6 alcohols). Alkanols can be butanol, isobutanol, propanol, isopropanol,<br>

one embodiment, the volatile solvent {e.g., alcohol) is present in an amount up to 5 % w/w,<br>
for example, 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, or 5% of the total composition. In certain embodiments, a<br>
volatile solvent or alcohol is optional, so that the formulation is non-alcoholic.<br>
x.	Propellants<br>
The present foamable suspension gels can contain a propellant. Depending on the relative densities of the foamable suspension gel base and the propellant, the propellant can be dispersed within the gel, dissolved within the gel, or layered over or under the gel. Exemplified aerosol propellants of use include, for example, hydrocarbons, chlorofluorocarbons, dimethy] ether, hydrofluorocarbons, compressed gases, or mixtures thereof.<br>
32<br><br>
The maximum amount of propellant used can be determined by its miscibility with other components in the composition to form a mixture, such as a homogeneous mixture. The minimal level of propellant used in the composition can be determined by the desired foam characteristics, and its ability to substantially or completely evacuate the container.<br>
The propellant concentration can be up to about 20%, usually up to about 5% or 10%, for example, in the range of about 2-15%, 3-10%, 4-7% w/w relative to the total amount of composition, for example, abouf2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 6%, 7%, 8%, 9%, 10%, 11%, 12%, 13%,. 14%, or 15% w/w. In one embodiment, the amount of propellant added to the foamabie suspension gel compositions is about 2.8 g of propane/butane propellant for each about 50 g of the presently described foamabie suspension gel bases.<br>
In one embodiment, the propellant is a mixture of propane and butane. The present compositions can be packaged in a pofyamide-imide-lined aluminum can and pressurized<br>
with a propane/butane mixture as the propellant.   in one embodiment, the propellant can<br>
i<br>
comprise or consist of a mixture of propane, n-butane, isobutene, and pentane. In one exemplified embodiment, the propellant can comprise or consist of about 55% propane, about 30% n-butane, and about 15% isobutane.<br>
While   chlorofluorocarbons   (CFCs)   can   also   be   used   as   propellants,   due   to<br>
environmental concerns propellants can be hydrocarbons, in particular, propane, butane,<br>
pentane, or mixtures thereof.   Other suitable propellants include dimethyl ether, nitrogen,<br>
argon, hydrofluorocarbons such as 134a and 227, and mixtures of any of the foregoing.<br>
xi.	Other Excipients<br>
Jn some embodiments, the foamabie suspension gel comprises preservatives, emollients, humectants, or other phamiaceutically acceptable excipients known in the art.<br>
In addition to those enumerated above, any other dermatologically acceptable excipients commonly known  to  those of ordinary skill  in the  art as  useful  in  topical<br>
33<br><br>
compositions are contemplated as useful in the compositions described herein. Further, any non-toxic, inert, and effective topical carrier may be used to formulate the compositions described herein. Well-known carriers used to formulate other topical therapeutic compositions for administration to humans will be useful in these compositions. Examples of these components that are well known to those of skill in the art are described in The Merck Index, Thirteenth Edition, Budavari et al., Eds., Merck &amp; Co., Inc., Rahway, NJ. (2001); the CTFA (Cosmetic, Toiletry, and Fragrance Association) International Cosmetic Ingredient Dictionary and Handbook, Tenth Edition (2004); and the "Inactive Ingredient Guide", U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) Office of Management, January 1996, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. Examples of such useful phannaceutically acceptable excipients, carriers and diluents include distilled water, physiological saline, Ringer's solution, dextrose solution, Hank's solution, and DMSO, which are among those preferred for use herein.<br>
These additional other inactive components, as well as effective formulations and administration procedures, are well known in the art and are described in standard textbooks, such as Goodman and Gillman 's: The Pharmacological Bases of Therapeutics, 8th Ed., Gilman et al. Eds. Pergamon Press (1990) and Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 17th Ed., Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa. (1990), both of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.<br>
b.	Physicochemical Properties<br>
i	Viscosity<br>
The foamable suspension gels have an appropriately balanced viscosity, that is sufficiently viscous to hold the one or more active agents in a suspension, but not so viscous so as to be unable lo be expelled from a container. The suspension gels can have a viscosity that achieves a pourable gel and tliat allows the gel to be expelled easily and evenly from a<br>
34<br><br>
container.  A gel having a viscosity sufficient to maintain the one or more active agents in a suspension also aids in maintaining the chemical and physical stability of the active agents.<br>
In some embodiments, the foamable suspension gels have a final viscosity of less than about 40,000 centipoises (cP), 20,000 cP, 15,000 cP, or 10,000 cP at 25°C. In some embodiments, the foamable suspension gel has a/viscosity of about 5,000 cP, 6,000 cP, 7,000 cP, 8,000 cP, 9,000 cP, 10,000 cP, 12,000 cP, 15,000 cP, 18,000 cP, 20,000 cP, 25,000 cP, 30,000 cP, 35,000 cP, or 40,000 cP at 25°C. In some embodiments, the foamable suspension gel has a viscosity of about 1,000-20,000 cP, 5,000-15,000 cP, 6,000-12,000 cP, or 7,000-10,000 cP at 25°C In some embodiments, the foamable suspension gel has a viscosity of about 5,000-15,000 at25°C.<br>
The viscosity of the foamable suspension gets can be measured with a suitable viscosity measuring device. Techniques include: (i) Brookfleld Synchro-iectric rotating spindle viscometer, where the spindle is introduced into the suspension gel and viscosity is measured at a range of temperatures; and (ii) Brookfield Cone &amp; Plate Viscometer, where samples of foam are introduced between the cone and plate and the rheology of the foam is determined over a range of shear rates and temperatures.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment, the present foamable suspension gels have a viscosity permitting them to be delivered through an actuator. ii.        Density<br>
The present foamable suspension gels have a density sufficient to maintain the active agents in a suspension. However, the density can be more or less than that of the active agents included in the suspension gel.<br>
In some embodiments, the density at 25°C of the foamable suspension gel concentrate is at least about O.S g/ml, in the range of about 0.8-1.5 g/ml, for example, about 0.8 g/ml, 0.9<br>
35<br><br>
g/ml, 0.95 g/ml, 1 g/ml, 1.05 g/ml, 1.1 g/ml, 1.15 g/ml, 1.2 g/ml, 1.25 g/ml, 1.3 g/ml, 1.35 g/ml, 1.4 g/ml, 1.45 g/ml, or 1.5 g/ml at 25°C.<br>
In contrast, the foam density of the dispensed foam, after dispensing from the container, is preferable about 0.6 to about 0.9 g/ml at 25°C<br>
The density of the present foamable suspension gels can be measured with a suitable density determination apparatus. Techniques include: (i) pycnometer/weight per gallon cup, where the foamable suspension gel at fixed temperatures is carefully introduced into a fixed-volume vessel of known volume and mass; and (ii) Electronic density/specific gravity meter, where a slow stream of foamable suspension gel at fixed temperatures is introduced into a flow-through cell and the density is determined by the oscillating body method. iii.       pH<br>
The pH of the foamable suspension gels will depend on the active agents included in the formulations. The final pH will promote the chemical and physical stability of the active agents.<br>
In the embodiments where benzoyl peroxide and clindamycin are included in the foamable suspension gel, the pH is acidic, in the range of about 4.0-5.1 or 4.2-4.6 or 4.4-5.1, for example, about 4.00, 4.05, 4.10, 4.15, 4.20, 4.25, 4.30, 4.35, 4.40, 4.45, 4.50, 4.55, 4.60, 4.65, 4.70, 4.75, 4.80, 4.85, 4.90, 4.95, 5.00, 5.05, or 5.10.<br>
pH values can be measured using techniques known in the art, for example, by using a pH meter and an appropriate probe.<br>
iv.	Particle Size of Active Agents<br>
The particle size of the active agents included in the foamable suspension gels should be sufficiently small or fine to remain suspended in the gel and not settle out, to allow for a smooth feel upon administration of the foamable gel, and to release from the container without clogging the exit channel. The active agent particles should not be so small so as to<br>
36<br><br>
become a tightly packed agglomeration that can not be redispersed upon shaking or so large that they settle out of the foamable suspension gel or impart a gritty feel to the foam. The particles can be of a uniform size or of varying sizes within a range of diameters. In one embodiment, greater than about 90% of the active agent particles are of a uniform size (i.e., monodispersed).<br>
In some embodiments, the particle sizes of the active agents have an average diameter of in the range of about 0.5-100 µrn, usually less than about 20 or 15 µrn, more often an average diameter of less about 10 urn, usually in the range of about 5µm to about 10 µm, for example, with an average diameter of about 5 µm, 6 µrn, 7 urn, 8 µm, 9 µ.m, 10µm, 20µm, or 50 µm.<br>
Particle size can be measured using techniques known in the art, including, for example, visual inspection using a microscope (e.g., 100X or 200X magnification).<br>
The extent and rate of settling of particles can be monitored and quantified using<br>
techniques known in the art, for example, by subjecting aliquots to a Turbiscan analysis.<br>
Equipment for quantifying the turbidity or physical stability of a suspension gel can be<br>
purchased, for example, from Formulaction, I'Union (near Toulouse), France,<br>
v.	Pressure<br>
The present foamable suspension gels can be packaged in a container. In some embodiments, the container is pressurized. The pressure in the container should be sufficient to allow the efficient expelling of the foamable gel. The pressure in the pressurized container should not be so high such that the gel releases without control as to application or amount. Also, lower pressures provide for the post-foaming of the gel upon release from the pressurized container.<br>
Tn some" embodiments of the present subject matter, the foamable suspension gel is in a single container.  The container can be a pressurized container.  In other embodiments, the<br>
37<br><br>
foam able suspension gel may be in multiple containers.<br>
In some embodiments, the gel is a post-foaming gel, which foams after release from a container, for example, a pump or pressurized container.<br>
In some embodiments, the container is a non-pressurized container, for example, a pump, tube, bottle, jar, or any suitable dispensing package or device.<br>
In some embodiments, the foamable suspension gel comprises an aerosol propellant. In some embodiments, the container is pressurized, and additionally contains a propellant. The pressure in the pressurized container is from about 5 psig to about 110 psig at 21-25°C, for example, about 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 100 or 110psig at 21-25°C.<br>
In some embodiments, the pressurized container is pressurized to about 63-80 psig, for example, about 63 psig, 64 psig, 65 psig, 66 psig, 61 psig, 68 psig, 69 psig, 70 psig, 71 psig, 72 psig, 73 psig, 74 psig, 75 psig, 76 psig, 78 psig, 79 psig, or 80 psig, as measured at 21-25°C.<br>
vi.        Stability<br>
As used herein, stability refers to the chemical and physical integrity of the one or more active agents in the foamable suspension gels. One or more of the active agents may be subject to, for example, oxidation or chemical degradation.<br>
Oxidation of an active agent can be monitored and quantified, for example, by using a color indicator that changes color in correlation to the presence or absence of oxidation or the extent of oxidation, for example, potassium iodide. The potassium iodide is colorless in the absence of oxidation, turns yellow in the presence of oxidation, and becomes brown with increasing oxidation. Color changes can be quantified using a spectrophotometer, for example, a ColorQuest Color Measurement System, commercially available from Hunter Associates Laboratory, Reston, VA.<br>
38<br><br>
Chemical degradation of an active agent can be monitored and quantified, for example, using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Methods for carrying out HPLC are well known in the art. See, for example, High Performance Liquid Chromatography: Fundamental Principles and Practice, Lough, et al., eds., 1996, Kluwer Academic Pub, and Meyer, Practical High-performance Liquid Chromatography, 2004, John Wiley &amp; Sons. Degradation can be quantified by measuring the decrease of peak size {e.g., height of a peak or area under a peak) on the data output of peaks indicating undegraded active agent (e.g., benzoyl peroxide or clindamycin), and/or the increase of peak size of peaks indicating degraded active agent (e.g., benzoic acid or clindamycin sulfoxide isomers).<br>
Stability can depend on time and temperature. Preferably, at least about 90%, 93%, 95%, or 97% of undegraded active agent is detected in the suspension gel formulation after at least about 3, 4, 5, 6 months at 5°C, 25°C or 30°C. For example, the foamable suspension gels can retain at least about 80%, 85%, 90% undegraded active agent for at least 6 months at 25°C. The foamable suspension gels can retain at least about 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 9S% undegraded active agent for at least 12 months, or at least 24 months at 5°C. The amount of undegraded active agent can be measured in comparison to the freshly prepared gel or in comparison to the amount of degraded active agent formed.<br>
In some embodiments, the first and second active agents within the foamable suspension gel are chemically and physically stable for at least 3 months, 4 months, 5 months, 6 months at 5°C, 25°C or 30°C. In some embodiments, the first and second active agents within the foamable suspension gel are chemically and physically stable for at least 12 months, or for at least 24 months, at 5°C.<br>
39<br><br>
Methods of Treating a Dermatological Condition<br>
The  present  subject   matter  also  provides   for  methods  of therapeutically  and<br>
prophylactically treating a dermatological condition by topically applying the foam of the<br>
foamable suspension gels of the present subject matter to affected areas.    Exemplified<br>
dermatological conditions suitable for treatment by the present foamable suspension gels<br>
include rashes, eczema, contact dermatitis, acne (including acne vulgaris and acne rosacea),<br>
j fungal infections, and bacterial infections.   The foamable suspension gels are particularly<br>
suitable for treating acne.<br>
Acne is treated both therapeutically and prophylactically by applying the foam of the foamable suspension gel to the skin in areas where acne lesions are present or likely to be present. The foam is generally rubbed into the skin until the foam is totally collapsed. The foam can be applied one, two, three, four or more limes a day, as needed, or as directed by a healthcare provider. The collapsed foam may be left on the skin or washed off as desired depending upon the purpose of application. Alternatively, the foam may be applied as a facial mask and washed off after use.<br>
Combination Therapy<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the present preferred compositions may be used in combination with an additional pharmaceutical dosage form to enhance their effectiveness in treating a dermatological disease or disorder, particularly acne. In this regard, the present preferred compositions may be administered as part of a regimen additionally including any other pharmaceutical aud/or pharmaceutical dosage form known in the art as effective for the treatment of a dermatological disorder. Similarly, a phamiaceutically active ingredient other than those specified herein can be added to the present preferred compositions to enhance their effectiveness in treating a dermatological disease or disorder. Accordingly, this additional phamiaceutically active ingredient or additional pharmaceutical dosage form can<br>
40<br><br>
be applied to a patient either directly or indirectly, and concomitantly or sequentially, with the preferred compositions described herein.<br>
In one embodiment in this regard, the present preferred composition and the additional pharmaceutical dosage form can be administered to a patient at the same time. In an alternative embodiment, one of the present preferred compositions and the additional pharmaceutical dosage form can be administered in the morning and the other can be administered in the evening.<br>
Methods of Producing a Foamable Suspension Gel<br>
The manufacturing process for the present foamable suspension gel base involves the preparation of several phases that are subsequently combined. This is largely due to the particulate nature of the first active agent that is sparingly soluble to insoluble in water.<br>
In one approach, a "gel concentrate" is prepared by combining water and a thickening agent. Thereafter, the first active agent is mixed with a dispersing/wetting agent to form a homogenous dispersion while mixing. Mixing of the dispersion containing the first active agent is continued to prevent the first active agent from settling to the base of the mixing vessel and creating a solid "cake."<br>
Next, the gel concentrate is admixed to the dispersion containing the first active agent during stirring to produce a physically stable gel holding the first active agent in suspension. The size of particles of the first active agent (and other active agents) in the gel can be reduced through a milling process.<br>
Where the suspension gel is intended to include one or more second active agents, the following subsequent steps are undertaken. In a separate vessel, a gel containing a thickening agent and the second active agent is prepared. When the second active agent is a Uncomycin antibiotic, such as clindamycin phosphate, no pH adjustment is necessary.  That is, the pH of<br>
41<br><br>
the solution containing clindamycin phosphate is below pH 5.5, below pH 5.2 or below pH 5, such as pH 4 to 4.5 (e.g., 4, 4.], 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, or 4.5).<br>
Subsequently, the gel containing the first active agent is blended with a gel containing the second active agent, resulting in a foamable suspension gel base containing the first and second active agents (and other active agents).<br>
The foamable suspension gel base can then be added into the individual containers during the filling operation. The valves are fitted to the cans and crimped into place. In pressurized containers, a metered amount of propellant can be injected through the valve to complete the formulation. Another means of filling the cans involves a single-liquid-phase fill, in which the composition is kept warm to ensure homogeneity, followed by crimping and propellant injection. Yet another means involves formulating the entire composition, including the propellant, in bulk, under pressure, and then injecting the formulation into a crimped aerosol can.<br>
The compositions made according to this method are preferably in an aerosol dosage form suitable for topical application. Accordingly, said production method can additionally comprise the further step of charging the container with a propellant suitable to effect aerosol delivery of the composition from the container.<br>
The effectiveness of the present pharmaceutical formulations depends on achieving the proper combination of formulation, container, and valve assembly.<br>
The Container<br>
The instant foamable pharmaceutical compositions are preferably packaged  in a<br>
container as an aerosol.   The compositions may be packaged in the container using either a<br>
single-step or a multiple-step filling process commonly known to those of ordinary skill in<br>
the art.<br>
42<br><br>
The container must be selected to provide the aerosol formulation with a long shelf life. Accordingly, the container must be chemically inert with respect to the composition contained therein so as not to interfere with the stability of the formulation or with the integrity and operation of the container. Further, the container must be capable of withstanding the pressure required by the product, must be corrosive-resistant, and must be resistant to physical or chemical changes to the product contained therein that may, for example, form particles clogging the orifice. This is particularly important as the present compositions contain a surfactant and an acid, two components known to increase the potential for corrosion.<br>
The selection of a suitable container for the aerosol product is based on its adaptability to production methods, compatibility with formulation components, ability to sustain the pressure intended for the product, the interest in design and aesthetic appeal on the part of the manufacturer, and cost. Suitable containers may be made of, for example, steel, aluminum, glass, plastic, or mixtures thereof. The containers may further employ one or more protective coatings such as, for example, sodium nitrate, sodium benzoate, ammonium m-nitrobenzoate, morpholine, 2-methy! butynoyl, Expoxol 9-5, sodium n-lauroylsarcosinate, phenolic, epoxy, or vinyl coatings, to enhance the formulation compatibility or safe handling. Any other known aerosol containers and protective coatings are further contemplated as useful in this regard.<br>
The container may also comprise two or more compartments permitting the final composition to be broken up into separate portions that are physically separated until dispensed from the container through the valve assembly.<br>
Known methods for filling aerosol containers with foamable compositions include processes known as cold fill, under the cup, and pressure fill (through the valve). Such methods for filling an aerosol container are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art<br>
43<br><br>
and may be found in The Aerosol Handbook (Wayne E. Dorland, Caldwell, NJ) and the Handbook of Aerosol Technology, (R.E. Krieger, Malabar, FL), both of which are incorporated by reference in their entirety.<br>
In the cold filling method, both the product concentrate and the propellant must be cooled to temperatures of-30° to 40°F. The chilled product concentrate is quantitatively metered into an equally cold aerosol container, then the cold, liquefied gas is added. When sufficient propellant has been added, the valve assembly is placed on the container.<br>
In the under the cap filling method, a filling head that forms a tight seal on the container shoulder is utilized. The filling head holds the valve above the container while propellant under pressure is added through the opening in the container.<br>
In the pressure filling method, the product concentrate is quantitatively placed in the container, the valve assembly is placed on the container, and the liquefied gas, under pressure, is metered through the valve stem into the container. Pressure filling is used for most pharmaceutical aerosols.<br>
Valve Assembly<br>
The function of the valve assembly is to permit the expulsion of the contents of the<br>
can in the desired form, at the desired rate, and, in the case of metered valves, in the proper<br>
amount or dose,   Accordingly, the valve assembly must contribute to the form of the product<br>
to be emitted.   In particular, aerosol foam valves typically have a large-diameter delivery<br>
spout to permit the delivery of the foam.   Further, the valve assembly permits the aerosol<br>
composition to be released from the container either via continuous delivery or as a metered<br>
dose.<br>
The materials used in the manufacture of the valve assembly must be inert towards the<br>
aerosol formulations that pass therethrough.   Among the materials that can be used in the<br>
mantifacture of the various valve parts are plastic, rubber, aluminum, stainless steel, and<br>
44<br><br>
mixtures thereof. The usual aerosol valve assembly is composed of the following parts: actuator, stem, gasket, spring, mounting cup, housing, and dip tube. Valves may also be employed that permit emission of product while the container is upright or inverted. -All types of valve assemblies known to those of ordinary skill in the art, including spray valves, sliding gasket valves, deflecting gasket valves, and tilt action valves, are contemplated as capable of delivering the present inventive compositions.<br>
Metering valves are designed to deliver specific quantities of a product each time the valve is actuated. Meter valves are usually employed when the formulation is a potent medication or in other instances where a precise dosing is desired. In metered valve systems, an auxiliary valve chamber regulates the amount of material discharged by virtue of its capacity or dimensions.<br>
The valve assembly may further accommodate an attachment to facilitate delivery of the present inventive foamable pharmaceutical compositions.<br>
Dosage<br>
Appropriate dosage levels for any of the herein described active ingredients are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art and are selected to maximize the treatment of the previously described microbial and/or fungal conditions. Dosage levels on the order of about 0.001 mg to about 5,000 mg per kilogram body weight of the active ingredient components are known to be useful in the treatment of the diseases, disorders, and conditions contemplated herein. Typically, this effective amount of the active agent will generally comprise from about 0.001 mg to about 100 mg per kilogram of patient body weight per day. Moreover, it will be understood that this dosage of ingredients can be administered in a single or multiple dosage units to provide the desired therapeutic effect.<br>
If desired, other therapeutic agents can be employed in conjunction with those provided in  the above-described compositions.    The amount of pharmaceutically active<br>
45<br><br>
ingredients that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated, the nature of the disease, disorder, or condition, and the nature of the active ingredients.<br>
The preferred pharmaceutical compositions may be given in a single or multiple doses daily, in a preferred embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions are given from one to three times daily. Starting with a low dose twice daily and slowly working up to higher doses if needed is a preferred strategy. The amount of pharmaceutically active ingredients that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated, the nature of the disease, disorder, or condition, and the nature of the active ingredients.<br>
It is understood, however, that a specific dose level for any particular patient will vary depending upon a variety of factors, including the activity of the specific pharmaceutically active agent; the age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the patient; the time of administration; the rate of excretion; possible drug combinations; the severity of the particular condition being treated; and the form of administration. One of ordinary skill in the art would appreciate the variability of such factors and would be able to establish specific dose levels using no more than routine experimentation.<br>
The optimal pharmaceutical formulations will be determined by one skilled in the art depending upon considerations such as the particular pharmaceutically active agent combination and the desired dosage. See,, for example, "Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences", 18th ed. (1990, Mack Publishing Co., Easton, PA 18042), pp. 1435-1712, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. Such formulations may influence the physical state, stability, rate of in vivo release, and rate of in vivo clearance of the essential lipids.<br>
