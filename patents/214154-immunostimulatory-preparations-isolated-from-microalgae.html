FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method for the extraction of immunostimulatory polysaccharide preparations from food-grade microalgae. It further relates to the identification of the structurally complex immunostimulatory water-soluble polysaccharide preparations isolated from food-grade microalgae containing active polysaccharides having an apparent molecular weight above 2 million daltons. It also relates to methods for the treatment and/or prevention of a variety of disease conditions using the preparations of this Invention.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
During the past three decades immunotherapy has become an important approach for treating human diseases and conditions through the use of regimens designed to modulate immune responses. This is particularly important in pathofogicaf conditions where the immune system becomes compromised. Studies conducted in disease models and clinical trials demonstrate that augmenting host defense mechanisms is useful in treatment and prophylaxis against microbial infections, immunodeficiency, cancer, and autoimmune disorders (1 - 5). Immune enhancing protocols may also have utility for promoting wound healing. In the process of wound healing, macrophages exhibit a principal role by modulating cellular proliferation and new tissue formation/regeneration. They afso function as phagocytes, debridement agents and produce growth factors that influence the angiogenesis stage of wound repair<br>
(6).<br>
Historically, the first Immunostimulants developed were bacterial products (lysates and crude fractions), attenuated microbes or heat-killed bacteria. These included agents such as bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG), Corynebacterium parvum, and lip polysaccharide (1, 2). Although these agents have had limited success due to toxicities and side-effects, many have been licensed by the USDA for immunomodulation in veterinary medicine (3).  Other substances have been<br><br>
developed from various sources and include those of natural origin, those derived by chemical synthesis or those synthesized using recombinant technologies. Most immunostimulants of natural origin are high molecular weight polysaccharides, glycoprotein or complex peptides (1). For example, three fungal polysaccharides derived from Schizophyllum commune (schizophylian), Lentinus edodes (lentinan) and Orioles vermicular (krestin) are cun^ently in clinical use In Japan as biological response modifiers (4). Another polysaccharide, acemannan (isolated from Aloe vera), is licensed by the United States Department of Agriculture for the treatment of fibrosarcoma in dogs and cats (7). There are a few small molecular weight immunostimulants derived from natural products such as the glycosphlngolipid KRN-7000. A clinical trial using KRN-7000 as an Immunostimulant for treatment of solid tumors is currently in progress (8). Several immunostimulants of synthetic origin also have been developed that include compounds, like isoprinosine and muramyl peptides (2). Recently a number of other immunomodulators of endogenous origin have been developed using recombinant technologies that have gained FDA approval. These agents include colony-stimulating factors, interferons and recombinant proteins (5). However, these compounds often have short half-lives and it is difficult to determine optimal dosage and appropriate combinations.<br>
Although current immunostimulants show promise, there is still a need to develop more potent agents and increase the arsenal of available drugs for immunotherapy. One source of chemically diverse compounds that can be used for drug discovery of immunostimulants is natural products. For centuries natural products have been exploited as therapeutically useful agents, many of which are in clinical use today. Interest in natural products as a means to drug discovery is based on their unparalleled molecular diversity and rich spectrum of biological activities (9).<br>
Since ancient times, microalgae have been used as a nutrient-dense food source. Historical records indicate that microalgae such as Spirulina platen sis was consumed by tribes around Lake Chad in Africa and by the Aztecs living near Lake Texcoco in Mexico (10). During the last several decades there has been increasing interest in the commercial production of food-grade microalgae for human consumption and as feed for livestock. Among the various microalgae that have  been  explored for their commercial  potential  Spirulina species.<br><br>
Chlorella species and Aphanizomenon flos-aquae (AFA) are three major types that have been successfully produced and are in widespread use.<br>
Both anecdotal reports and recent studies on the consumption of food-grade microalgae have reported enhanced immune function in both animals and humans. Oral administration of Chlorella pyrenoidosa has been correlated with enhanced natural killer cell activity (11) and granulocyte-macrophage progenitor cells (12) In mice infected with Listeria monocytogenes. Dietary Spirulina platensis increases macrophage phagocytic activity in chickens (13) and Spirulina fusiformis exhibits chemopreventive effects in humans (14). Human consumption of AFA has been reported to produce changes in immune cell trafficking and enhanced immune surveillance (15). The active components for all these effects have not been conclusively established.<br>
Various compounds have been isolated from the microalgae studied herein. A number of polysaccharides and glycoproteins from Chlorella and Spirulina species have been characterized for their antitumor, antiviral and immunosfimulating activity. In contrast, no such compounds showing any biological activity have been isolated from AFA.<br>
A number of polysaccharides have been identified from Chlorella species that possess biological activity. In U.S. Pat. No. 4,533,548 an acidic polysaccharide was isolated from Chlorella pyrenoidosa that exhibits antitumor and antiviral activity (16). The glycosyl composition for this polysaccharide was mostly rhamnose, with minor amounts of galactose, arabinose, glucose and glucuronic acid. Another polysaccharide, isolated from marine Chlorella minutissima, reported in U.S. Pat. No. 4,831,020, appears to have tumor growth-Inhibiting effects. However, no molecular weight or glycosyl composition was reported (17).<br>
In U.S. Pat. No. 4,786,496, the lipid fraction (glycolipid portion) of marine Chlorella species displayed antitumor properties (18). Several glycoproteins have also been isolated from Chlorella species. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,822,612 reported a 45,000 dalton glycoprotein that has anticancer effects (19). Various other glycoproteins (20-23) and glyceroglycolipids (24) that may have immunopotentiating and antitumor properties also have been reported in the scientific literature. None of these compounds are polysaccharides.<br><br>
Several different types of polysaccharides that exhibit biological activity have been isolated from Spirulina species. For example, the sulfated polysaccharide calcium spirulan inhibits tumor invasion and metastasis (25). calcium splrulan (molecular weight 74,600 daltons) is composed of rhamnose (52.3%), 3-0-methylrhamnose (32.5%), 2,3-di-O-methylrhamnose (4.4%), 3-0-methylxylose (4.8%), uronic acids (16.5%) and sulfate (26).<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,585,365 discloses that an antiviral polysaccharide with a molecular weight between 250,000 and 300,000 daltons was isolated from Spirulina species using hot water extraction (27). This polysaccharide is composed of rhamnose, glucose, fructose, ribose, galactose, xylose, mannose, glucuronic acid and galacturonic acid. A number of other low molecular weight polysaccharides that range between 12,600 and 60,000 daltons recently have been isolated from Spirulina species (28-30).<br>
One way to determine immunostimulatory activity is to use a biological assay involving macrophages. Monocytes/macrophages are found in practically every tissue of the body where they are critical in coordinating immune responses and numerous biological processes (31). They play a major role in phagocytosis. Immune surveillance, wound healing, killing of microbes and tumor cells, and antigen presentation to T lymphocytes (32). In cancer, macrophages mediate tumor cytotoxicity functions through the production of cytokines and other immune factors (33). In order for macrophages to play a major role in adaptive and innate immunity they must respond effectively to environmental agents by first becoming activated (34). Macrophage activation Is mediated by proinflammatory transcription factors such as nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B). Such transcription factors then control and modulate the activation/ repression of an array of genes that mediate a variety of immune responses.<br>
In unstimulated macrophages, NF-kappa B exists as inactive heterodimers sequestered by inhibitory-kappa B (l-kappa B) proteins within the cytosol. Agents that cause l-kappa B proteins to dissociate and degrade allow for the translocation of NF-kappa B dimmers to the nucleus where they can activate transcription of downstream genes (35). Target genes regulated by NF-kappa B include proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, inflammatory enzymes, adhesion molecules and receptors (36).<br><br>
In this invention a transcription factor based assay for NF-kappa B in human monocots was used to guide extraction, isolation, characterization and development of immunpstimulatory polysaccharide preparations from food-grade microaigae. The polysaccharides of the present invention are both water soluble and soluble in aqueous ethanol solution unlike almost all other polysaccharides now available.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

Glycosyl composition and glycosyl linkage analyses were performed by The University of Georgia, Complex Carbohydrate Research Center. The glycosyl composition was determined using GC-mass spectrometry analysis of the TMS-methyl glycosides. In order to identify the O-methylated sugars detected during the TMS-methyl glycoside procedure, glycosyl composition was also determined using the alditol acetate procedure (38). Glycosyl linkage analysis was performed using the Hakomori procedure (39), In combination with carboxyl-reduction in order to detect uronic acid linkages (40).<br>
EXAMPLE 1 — Initial isolation of a high molecular weight polysaccharide preparation from AFA (NP16847) that exhibits potent monocyte activation properties<br>
A crude extract from AFA (Lot No. 0110FA from Cell Tech, Klamath Falls, OR), was prepared by extracting the freeze-dried material (125g) three times (4 hours each) with 70% ethanol at 40°C. This crude extract had an EC50 value of 10pg/mL. Aqueous ethanol extracts were evaporated to dryness and then solvent partitioned between water and chloroform (1:1). The activity was found exclusively in the water layer which was further partitioned against n-butanol (water:n-butanol, 63:37).   The more active water layer (EC5o=0.5ijg/mL) was<br><br>
subjected to alcohol precipitation (water:methanol:ethanol, 1:2:3) at -80 °C for 24 hours. This precipitated material, which is referred to as the pre-ultrafiltrate preparation, had an EC50 value of 0.2μg/mL and represents a recovery of 3% of dry AFA weight. This material was then passed through an ultrafiltration device with a 100,000 molecular weight cut-off polyethersulfone membrane (Centricon Plus-20 from Millipore, Bedford, MA). The retentate was subsequently washed several times with 3% KCI (w/v) to remove impurities that adhered (probably through ionic interaction) to the large molecular weight material. The retentate, which is referred to as post-ultrafiltrate material, had an EC50 value of 0.1pg/mL, representing a recovery of 0.6%.<br>
The cryohydrates content of the post-ultrafiltrate NP16847 preparation was estimated to be between 90% and 100% using a colorimetric assay (41) with phenol-sulfuric acid at 450 nm and 490 nm. It is concluded from this result that this material is a preparation of polysaccharides. Elemental analysis performed by Galbraith Laboratories, Inc. (Knoxville, TN) revealed that this material contains the following elements: 49.1% carbon, 40.8% oxygen, 7.62% hydrogen, 2.46% nitrogen and trace amounts of sulfur. Glycosyl composition and linkage analysis for the post-ultrafiltrate is presented in Table 1. NP16847 is comprised predominantly of mannose, glucose, 4-methyl mannose, rhamnose and methylated sugar residues along with other simple sugars and acetylated amino sugars. This is the first report of any polysaccharide isolated from AFA exhibiting any type of biological activity.<br>
The post-ultrafiltrate NP16847 was analyzed using size exclusion chromatography (SEC). The set-up consisted of a Model 600E system controller, UK6 injector, Model 600 solvent delivery system, Model 401 differential refractometer and a Model 3396A Hewlett-Packard integrator. Analyses were performed at a flow rate of 1 mL/minute using HPLC grade water and a Shodex Opal KB-805 SEC column (300mm length x 8mm ID) held at 30°C. This column is capable of separating molecules up to an estimated molecular weight of 4 million daltons. Analysis of post-ultrafiltrate NP16847 showed one peak that eluted in the void volume (Fig. 1) and had a retention time consistent with an apparent molecular weight of above 2 million daltons based on comparison with dextran standards.<br><br>
The isolation procedure described in Example 1 for the purification of AFA poiysaccharides is novel since tlie initial extraction uses 70% ethanol as compared with prior art procedures which employ hot water. To determine if this procedure could be used as a general method for the extraction of immunostimulatory polysaccharides from other food-grade microalgae, the procedure described in Example I was applied to two other microalgae commonly consumed as food supplements namely Chlorella pyrenoidosa and Spirullna platensis.<br>
EXAMPLE 2 — initial isolation of a high molecular weight polysaccharide preparation from Chlorella pyrenoidosa (NP16848) that exhibits potent monocyte activation properties<br>
A crude extract from Chlorella (Lot No. VP0978 from Sun Chlorella, Torrance, CA), was prepared by extracting the freeze-drled material (35g) three times (4 hours each) with 70% ethanol at 40°C. This crude extract had an EC50 value of 25ijg/mL. Aqueous ethanol extracts were evaporated to dryness and then solvent partitioned between water and chloroform (1:1). The activity was found exclusively in the water layer which was further partitioned against n-butanol (water:n-butanol, 63:37). The more active water layer was subjected to alcohol precipitation (water:methanol:ethanoI, 1:2:3) at -80°C for 24 hours. The precipitate material was then passed through an ultrafiltration device with a 100,000 molecular weight cut-off polyethersulfone membrane (Centricon Plus-20 from Millipore, Bedford, MA). The retentate was subsequently washed several times with 3% KCI (w/v) to remove impurities that adhered (probably through ionic interaction) to the large molecular weight material. The post-ultrafiltrate material had an EC50 value of 0.3μg/mL, and represented a recovery of 0.2%.<br>
The carbohydrate content of the post-ultrafiltrate NP16848 preparation was estimated to be between 90% and 100% using a colorimetric assay (41) with phenol-sulfuric acid at 450 nm and 490 nm.

The post-ultrafiitrate NP16848 analyzed using the HPLC size exclusion chromatography procedure described in Example 1 was found to contain one peak that eluted in the void volume (Fig. 2) and had a retention time consistent with an apparent molecular weight of above 2 million daltons based on comparison with dextran standards.<br>
EXAMPLE 3 — Initial isolation of a high molecular weight polysaccharide preparation from Spirufina platensis ^NP16846) that exhibits potent monocyte activation properties<br>
A crude extract from Spinilina (Lot No. B16933 from Triarco Industries, Wayne, NJ) was prepared by extracting the freeze-dried material (35g) three times (4 hours each) with 70% ethanol at 40""C. This crude extract had an EC50 value of 50μg/mL. Aqueous ethanol extracts were evaporated to dryness and then solvent partitioned between water and chloroform (1:1). The activity was found exclusively in the water layer which was further partitioned against n-butanol (watern-butanol, 63:37). The water layer was the more active and was subjected to alcohol precipitation (water:methanoi:ethanol, 1:2:3) at -80°C for 24 hours. The precipitate material was then passed through an ultrafiltration device with a 100,000 molecular weight cut-off polyethersulfone membrane (Centricon Plus-20 from Millipore, Bedford, MA). The retentate was subsequently washed several times with 3% KCl (w/v) to remove impurities that adhered (probably through ionic interaction) to the large molecular weight material. The post-ultrafiltrate material had an EC50 value of 0.3μg/mL, representing a recovery of 0.1%.<br>
The carbohydrate content of the post-ultrafiltrate Spirulina preparation was estimated to be between 90% and 100% using a colorimetric assay (41) with phenol-sulfuric acid at 450 nm and 490 nm. It is concluded from this result that this material is a preparation of polysaccharides. Glycosyl composition and linkage analysis for the post-ultrafiltrate is presented in Table 3. NP16846 Is comprised predominantly of rhamnose, glucuronic acid, fucose, galactose and methylated sugar residues along with other simple sugars, uronic acids and acetylated   amino   sugars.      Other   polysaccharides   with   similar   glycosyl<br><br>
compositions from Spirulina species have been reported in the literature but are mucli smaller in size than NP16846.<br>
The post-ultrafiltrate NP16846 analyzed using the HPLC size exclusion chromatography procedure described in Example 1 was found to contain one peak that eluted in the void volume (Fig. 3) and had a retention time consistent with an apparent molecular weight of above 2 million daltons based on comparison with dextran standards.<br>
Monocyte/macrophage activation<br>
Messenger RNA (MRNA) levels of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1p and TNF-a were measured to confirm THP-1 monocyte/macrophage activation by microalgal polysaccharide preparations. The mRNA levels of GAPDH were also assayed as a control to detaining the specificity of changes in IL-1p and TNF-a mRNA levels. Since GAPDH is a housekeeping gene, mRNA levels would be expected to remain constant unless changes were induced artifactually.<br>
RT-PCR primers for IL-ip, TNF-a and GAPDH were purchased from Integrated DNA technologies, Inc. (Coralville, lA). Sequences for the primers were described in Su et al. (42). IL-lp poniard (5"-ATG-GCA-GAA-GTA-CCT-AAG-CTC-GC-3"); IL-lp reverse (5"-ACA-CAA-ATT-GCA-TGG-TGA-AGT-CAG-TT-3"); TNF-a fonward (5"-GAG-TGA-CAA-GCC-TGT-AGC-CCA-TGT-TGT-AGC-3"); TNF-a reverse (5"-GCA-ATG-ATC-CCA-AAG-TAG-ACC-TGC-CCA-GAC-T-3"); GAPDH fonfl/ard (5"-TGA-AGG-TCG-GAG-TCA-ACG-GAT-TTG-GT-3"); GAPDH reverse (5"-CAT-GTG-GGC-CAT-GAG-GTC-CAC-CAC-3").<br>
Actively growing THP-1 cells (3 mLs, 1x10® cells/mL) were incubated for 2 hours in the presence of test material. Total RNA was isolated using the TRI Reagent® kit (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH) in which cells are lysed using a combination of phenol and guanidine thiocyanate. After the addition of bromochloropropane, RNA is separated into the aqueous phase and subsequently precipitated with isopropanol. Total RNA recovered using this method was about 30pg. Electrophoresis of isolated RNA using 0.8% vagaries gel showed no signs of contaminating DNA.<br>
RT-PCR reactions were run using kit reagents from Promega (Madison, Wl). Each reaction used the following components (total volume of 30pL): 6pL AMV/Tfl 5x reaction buffer, 0.6pL dNTP mix (lOmM), 1.2pL MgSd4 (25mM),<br><br>
0.6pL AMV reverse transcriptase (5units/|jL), 0.6pL Tfl DNA polymerase (5units/pL), 1.2ML of each primer (15pmoi/ML), and 2ng total RNA (IL-1p, TNF-a) or 5ng total RNA (GAPDH). The RT-PCR protocol used a Techne Unit Progene automatic thermal cycler. First cycle consisted of 45 minutes at 48°C, followed by 2 minutes at 94""C. Amplification was achieved using 35 cycles: denature at 94°C for 45 seconds, anneal at 60°C for 1 minute, and extend at Sa"C for 2 minutes. The final cycle held samples at 68°C for 7 minutes. Electrophoresis of RT-PCR products (mRNA IL-ip, TNF-a and GAPDH) was accomplished using 12|jL of reaction mix on 5% polyacrylamide gels with ethidium bromide used as the staining agent.<br>
Treatment of THP-1 cells with either LPS or microalgal polysaccharide preparations resulted in a dramatic increase in both IL-ip mRNA (810bp) and TNF-a mRNA (444bp), as compared with the control. The mRNA levels of the housekeeping gene glyceraidehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH, lOOObp) was the same for all samples (Fig. 4).<br>
The observed NF-kappa B activation by NP16847, NP16848, and NP16846 was not due to endotoxin contamination of the preparations. This was confirmed by the results of the following two experiments which were conducted to address this possibility. First, polymyxin B (10pg/mL, Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) was added in combination with each polysaccharide preparation (0.1 to 1pg/mL) to observe whether there was any abrogation in NF-kappa B activation. Polymyxin B is a polycationic antibiotic known to block many of the biological effects of LPS by binding to the lipid A portion of the molecule. All three microalgal polysaccharide preparations were insensitive to polymyxin B addition (data not shown). Addition of polymyxin B to LPS (10pg/mL) suppressed NF-kappa B activation by 75%. The second experiment used to examine possible endotoxin-mediated effects was to look for the presence of p-hydroxymyristate in the glycosyl composition analysis. There was no detectable levels of p-hydroxymyristate in sample preparations of NP16848 and NP16846 . Thus, it is unlikely that the observed macrophage activation by NP16848 and NP16846 is due to endotoxins.<br>
However, in two different sample preparations of NP16847 small amounts of p-hydroxymyristate (0.6% of total peak area) were detected.    In order to<br><br>
determine how much "endotoxin-like" material was present, six samples of AFA were analyzed using the Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) assay (analysis performed by BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD). The amount of LAL positive material detected using this assay represented 0.002% of microalgal dry weight. By comparison, the percent recovery of NP16847 is about 300 times greater (0.6% of microalgal dry weight). This means that at the concentration required to produce half-maximal NF-kappa B activation by NP16847 (100ng/mL), the total amount of potential LAL positive material present would be 300pg/mL. This concentration of endotoxin would not be detectable using the macrophage assay system. Therefore, possible endotoxin contamination cannot account for the stimulatory effect of NP16847 on macrophage activation.<br>
Examples 1 through 3 demonstrate that polysaccharide preparations with potent immunostimulatory activity are extractable from food-grade microalgae using 70% ethanol at 40°C. Subsequent steps in the isolation of these polysaccharide preparations involved a complex protocol and the use of organic solvents. Polysaccharides are traditionally extracted from natural sources using hot water due to their high water solubility. This hot water isolation procedure therefore would be expected to yield a higher percent recovery of these polysaccharides as compared to the initial extraction using 70% ethanol. In addition, since a hot water extract would be less likely to contain non-polar material, it would not be necessary to use organic solvent partitioning if this method proved successful. However, contrary to the predicted behavior, water extraction (Examples 4 through 6) gave preparations substantially less active than the procedure using the initial extraction with aqueous ethanol (Example 1) and also posed additional problems.<br>
Both the HPLC size exclusion chromatographic analysis and immunostimulatory activity (macrophage activation) were measured as described in the earlier Examples. The microalgae used in each Example was freeze-dried AFA (Lot. 041900 Merc) obtained from Klamath Algae Products Inc., Klamath Falls, OR. Ultrafiltration (when used) was carried out using a device with a 100,000 molecular weight cut-off polyethersulfone membrane (Centricon Plus-20 from Millipore, Bedford, MA). For each experiment, the retentate material from ultrafiltration was washed several times with 3% KCI (w/v) to remove impurities<br><br>
that adhered (probably through ionic interaction) to the large molecular weight material.<br>
EXA!\/IPLE 4 — 40°C water extraction and phvcocvanin removal with alcohol precipitation<br>
Water extraction of AFA at 40°C was problematic because this crude extract contained a large amount of phycocyanin (a blue proteinaceous pigment). Attempts to remove phycocyanin by ultrafiltration were unsuccessful since this material was retained along with the NP16847 polysaccharide preparation in the 100,000-daIton molecular weight cut-off filter. Complete precipitation of the phycocyanin material by alcohol requires a solution of 70% ethanol or greater (data not shown). In order to evaluate this method, 10g of freeze-dried AFA was extracted three times with water (62.5mLs each time) at 40°C, between 4 and 8 hours each time. Crude water extract was lyophilized and ridiculed in 40mLs of water. Ethanol was added (92mLs) at room temperature to achieve a final concentration of 70% ethanol. Perceivable materials (containing phycocyanin) were removed and the supernatant passed through an ultrafiltration device. The material at each step in the isolation procedure was evaluated for macrophage activation (Fig. 5). Clearly, the majority of the immunostimulatory activity was lost in the precipitate (also containing phycocyanin) during the 70% ethanol precipitation. The percent recovery of post-ultrafiltrate material (above 100,000 daltons) using this method was 1.0%. Although this percent recovery is higher than the 0.6% recovery of the post-ultrafiltrate obtained using the 70% ethanol extraction procedure of Example 1, this material contains other substances besides NP16847 since it had an EC50 value of 1000ng/mL. By comparison, the material from Example 1 has an EC50 value of lOOng/mL.<br>
EXAMPLE 5 — 40°C water extraction and phvcocvanin removal with ammonium sulfate<br>
Methods for the isolation of phycocyanin (43, 44) typically use an ammonium sulfate precipitation (40 - 65% saturation). • This protocol was investigated to evaluate whether ammonium sulfate precipitation could selectively remove phycocyanin from the crude extract. Freeze-dried AFA (lOg) was extracted three times with water (62.5mLs each time) at 40°C, between 4 and 8 hours each time. Crude water extract was lyophilized and redissolved in 40 mLs<br><br>
of water containing 48g of ammonium sulfate (50% saturation). Perceivable materials (containing phycocyanin) were removed and the supematant passed through an ultrafiltration device. The percent recovery of post-ultrafiltrate material was 1.32%, but probably contained little NP16847 since its specific activity was quite low (EC50 &gt; 1000ng/mL). Figure 6 summarizes the immunostimulatory activity of the material at each step in the isolation procedure. Similar to the previous approach, the majority of NP16847 was precipitated along with the phycocyanin by the addition of ammonium sulfate.<br>
Clearly, the attempts to separate phycocyanin from NP16847 in the crude water extract were not successful. In addition, re-extraction of the marc material (leftover from the 40°C water extraction) using aqueous ethanol at higher temperatures (e.g. 50% ethanol/60°C) resulted in the isolation of a substantial amount of NP16847 (see Example 43). Thus, extracting with water at 40°C did not provide a complete recovery of NP16847.<br>
EXAMPLE 6 — 70°C hot water extraction<br>
Water extraction at higher temperatures such as 70°C would cause phycocyanin to denature and precipitate, leaving NP16847 and other polar molecules in solution. To evaluate this approach, 20g of freeze-dried AFA was extracted three times with water (125mLs each time) at 70°C, between 4 and 8 hours each time. This crude extract did not appear to contain any phycocyanin material as evidenced by the lack of blue color. The crude water extract was lyophilized and redissolved in 80mLs of water. NP16847 was precipitated using alcohol (watenmethanokethanol, 1:2:3) at -20°C for 24 hours. Precipitable materials were passed through an ultrafiltration device. Figure 7 summarizes the immunostimulatory activity of the material at each step in the isolation procedure. The EC50 value for macrophage activation of the post-ultrafiltrate material (200ng/mL) was slightly higher than the material obtained in Example 1 (100ng/mL). The percent recovery of post-ultrafiltrate material obtained using this method was 1.74%, substantially higher than the 0.6% NP16847 recovery obtained from the 70% ethanol procedure of Example 1. Therefore extraction with 70°C water recovers about 3 times as much NP16847 as indicated by the comparable EC50 values of the post-ultrafiltrate materials.<br><br>
Isolation of NP16847 using hot water extraction (at 70°C) offers several advantages over the isolation procedure in Example 1. No organic solvents are used, only a few steps are required to obtain the final material, and about 3 times more NP16847 is extracted. However, there are several disadvantages. First, the crude water extract needs to be lyophilized in order to concentrate it to avoid excessively high volumes of alcohol in the precipitation. Second, the pre-ultrafiltrate contains a substantial amount of inactive material (as evidenced by a low ECso value of about 500ng/mL and the HPLC chromatogram in Fig. 7) which results in a very slow purification using the ultrafiltration devices.<br>
Several additional methods were evaluated based on modifications to the 70% ethanol extraction procedure described in Example 1. The following Examples describe isolation procedures where the use of organic solvents was not required and the isolation is accomplished in a limited number of steps. A simple, economic and efficient process was developed which overcame all problems associated with hot water extraction.<br>
EXAI\/IPLE 7 — 70% ethanol extraction at 40°C with chloroform partitioning<br>
For the extraction of NP16847 in Example 1, the second solvent partitioning step between n-butanol and water resulted in a substantial loss of immunostimulatory activity into the butanol layer. Therefore, the protocol in Example 1 was modified to remove the n-butanol solvent partition step. This new method is Identical to the procedure in Example 1 except that there is only one solvent partition between chloroform and water (1:1). Figure 8 summarizes the isolation scheme and immunostimulatory activity at each step in the isolation process. The EC50 value for the post-ultrafiltrate material obtained using this method (200ng/mL) was slightly higher than the material obtained in Example 1 (100ng/mL). The percent recovery of post-ultrafiltrate NP16847 obtained using this procedure was 1.97%. Therefore, the removal of the butanol solvent partition step from the 70% ethanol extraction procedure (Example 1) enhanced recovery of post-ultrafiltrate NP16847 by over 3 fimes. However, the major disadvantage of this procedure is the use of chloroform in the organic solvent partition.<br>
EXAMPLE 8 — 70% ethanol extraction at 4Q°C and direct alcohol precipitation<br>
In order to evaluate an approach that skips both the butanol and chloroform partition, lOg of freeze-dried AFA was extracted two times with 70%<br><br>
ethanol (125mLs each time) at 40°C. The first extraction was for 3 hours and the second extraction was for 12 hours. Crude 70% ethanol extract was stored at -20°C for several hours and precipitable material removed by centrifugation. Precipitate was washed with cold 95% ethanol (to remove remaining non-polar material), redissolved in water and then passed through an ultrafiltration device. Figure 9 summarizes the immunostimulatory activity of the material at each step in the isolation procedure. EC50 value of the post-ultrafiltrate material was slightly higher (200ng/mL) as compared to the material obtained in Example 1 (lOOng/mL). The percent recovery of post-ultrafiltrate NP16847 was 1.2%. Although this yield Is 2 times higher than that obtained using the extraction procedure described in Example 1, It Is about 30% less than the recovery obtained using the protocol in Example 7. This lower yield is probably due to incomplete precipitation in 70% ethanol.<br>
EXAMPLE 9 — 70% ethanol extraction at 4Q°C and direct 80% alcohol precipitation<br>
The previous method (Example 8) was slightly modified to obtain a greater recovery of NP16847. The cmde extract from the 70% ethanol extraction was adjusted to 80% ethanol by addition of cold 100% ethanol and stored at -20°C for several hours. Precipitable material was processed the same as above. Figure 10 summarizes the Isolation scheme and immunostimulatory activity at each step in the isolation process. This modified method resulted In 5.7% recovery of pre-ultrafiltrate NP16847 preparation and an EC50 value of 200ng/mL in the monocyte activation assay. The percent recovery of post-ultrafiltrate material was 1.8%. EC50 value for the post-ultrafiltrate material {200ng/mL) was slightly higher than that observed for the material obtained in Example 1 (lOOng/mL), but identical to post-ultrafiltrate values obtained from Examples 6 and 7.<br>
The procedure of direct precipitation of the NP16847 polysaccharide preparation from the crude 70% ethanol extract (Example 9) successfully achieves the original aims. No organic solvents (or methanol) are used, there is no lyophilization/solvent evaporation step, and only a few steps are required to obtain a relatively pure preparation of NP16847. A semi-pure preparation of NP16847 (70% of which is less frian 100,000 daltons) can be obtained with elimination of the ultrafiltration purification step (refer to pre- and post-ultrafiltrate<br><br>
HPLC chromatograms in Fig. 10). This pre-ultraflltrate NP16847 preparation would be sufficient for a dietary supplement (botanical) extract. Isolation of this material would simply require a direct alcohol precipitation from a crude 70% ethane extract.<br>
Tlie following points summarize why this isolation procedure (Example 9) was superior to the others tested.<br>
1.	Water extraction at 40°C.<br>
a.	Contains high levels of phycocyanin which cannot be separated<br>
from NP16847 by ultrafiltration or by ethanoi or ammonium sulfate<br>
precipitation.<br>
b.	NP16847 obtained following ultrafiltration was of a low specific<br>
activity, EC50 -lOOOng/mL vs. 200ng/mL (Example 9).<br>
c.	The marc material contained a substantial amount of NP16847<br>
that could not be recovered using water extraction at this<br>
temperature (see Example 43).<br>
2.	Water extraction at 70""C.<br>
a.	Water extraction at this temperature contains excessive amounts<br>
of inactive polar material in the pre-ultrafiltrate. This is undesirable<br>
for two reasons. First, development of a pre-ultrafiltrate preparation<br>
would contain low levels of NP16847. Second, ultrafiltration is<br>
extremely slow to obtain a post-ultrafiltrate NP16847 preparation.<br>
b.	Although the procedure does not use toxic organic solvents it<br>
does require a lyophilization step of the crude extract.<br>
3.	70% ethanoi extraction followed by organic solvent partitioning.<br>
	a.   Clearly the major disadvantage of this step is the use of an<br>
organic solvent (i.e. chloroform) to remove non-polar material.<br>
From the examples described above, the optimum general procedure<br>
(Example 9) involves two initial extractions of freeze-dried AFA with 70% ethanoi<br>
at 40°C.    Crude extract is adjusted to 80% ethanoi and cooled to -20°C.<br>
   Precipitate is collected and washed with cold 95% ethanoi to remove residual<br>
lipophilic material.   The high molecular weight material (over 100,000 daltons),<br>
comprising -30% of the pre-ultrafiltrate polysaccharide preparation, can be<br>
isolated using ultrafiltration.   The following provides a comparison between the<br><br>
NP16847  preparation  obtained  in Example 9 and  NP16847  prepared  by extraction with 70% ettianolMCC (Example 1):<br>
NP16847 (Example 9)       NP16847 (Example 1)<br>
Pre-ultrafiltrate Recovery	5.7%	3.0%<br>
Pre-ultrafiltrate EC50 value	200ng/mL	200ng/mL<br>
Post-ultrafiltrate Recovery	1.8%	0.6%<br>
Post-ultraflltrate EC50 value	200ng/mL	lOOng/mL<br>
These data demonstrate that extracting AFA using the procedure in Example 9 results in 2 times more pre-ultrafiltrate and 3 times more post-ultrafiltrate NP16847. However, the EC50 value of the post-ultrafiltrate preparation obtained by this procedure is slightly higher than that obtained from Example 1, indicating that some of the enhanced recovery is due to inactive material. Therefore, the conditions used in Example 9 were selected as a starting point for further optimization to improve the specific activity of the NP16847 preparation because of the following advantages that are offered by this new isolation method:<br>
1.	Optimal yield and good specific activity of both the pre- and post-ultrafiltration NP 16847 polysaccharide preparations.<br>
2.	No toxic organic solvents are used.<br>
3.	No rotary evaporation or lyophilization of large volumes of water or solvent is involved.<br>
Examples 10-38 provide a detailed analysis of changing both extraction temperature and ethanol concentration in order to optimize conditions used in Example 9.<br>

Table 4 summarizes the influence of both temperature and the ethanol concentration used during the initial extraction on the end-points described above. The endpoints used to evaluate the effectiveness of each extraction condition were percent recovery of the pre-ultrafiftrate in addition to its EC50 value. The pre-ultrafiitrate material was selected for these analyses because of its potential use as either a dietary, supplement or pharmaceutical preparation.<br><br>
Elimination of the ultrafiltration step would represent a substantial simplification of the isolation procedure.<br>
The conditions used in Example 9 (70% ethanol/40°C) resulted in 5.7% recovery of pre-ultrafiltrate NP16847 with an EC50 value of 200ng/mL. Increasing extraction temperatures above 40°C coupled with the presence of 70% ethanol during the initial extraction improved recovery and specific activity of the NP16847 polysaccharide preparation. However, decreasing the extraction temperature from 40°C to 23°C with 70% ethanol, or any other concentration of ethanol, did not result in lower EC50 values. At this temperature {23°C), recoveries were enhanced at lower ethanol concentrations. Part of this increased recovery was probably due to a more efficient extraction of phycocyanin as evidenced by the enhanced blue color of the material. Extraction at higher temperatures using 70% ethanol slightly enhanced recovery and substantially increased specific activity (e.g. 70% ethanol/80°C). Extraction with 50% ethanol at any temperature above 40°C resulted in lower EC50 values as compared with other ethanol concentrations. At ethanol concentrations above and below 50% ethanol, specific activities generally decreased at each temperature condition. Ethanol concentrations above and below 50% had opposite effects on recovery: recoveries decreased with higher ethanol concentration but slightly increased with lower concentrations (at temperatures of 50°C and below). The lower recoveries coupled with decreased specific activity at ethanol concentrations higher than 50% suggest that less NP 16847 is being extracted under these conditions. For ethanol concentrations below 50%, the higher recoveries coupled with decreased specific activity suggest that more inactive material is extracted along with NP16847. At temperatures below 60°C with 30% and 40% ethanol, part of this inactive material is most likely due to more effective extraction of phycocyanin, again evidenced by the enhanced blue color of the precipitate.<br>
The region of Table 4 from 60° C - 80° -C at 50% ethanol represented conditions for both optimal recovery and specific activity. The preferred temperature range is between 60°C and 70°C (Examples 24 and 25) because further analysis of both the pre- and post-ultrafiltrate material derived from the 80°C, 40% to 60% ethanol extraction conditions showed substantial amounts of water  insoluble   material.     These  optimal  conditions  yield  post-ultrafiltrate<br><br>
recoveries between 4.5% and 5.6% (7.5 to 9.3 times more than the eariier 70% ethanol/40°C condition from Example 1) and an EC50 value of about 20ng/mL (5 times less than the 70% ethanolMO"C condition).<br>
EXAMPLE 39 — Shorter extraction times<br>
The data in Table 4 were collected on material extracted twice, first for 3 hours and second for 12 hours, under each condition. To optimize for large scale extraction of NP16847, shorter extractions times of 1 hour each were tested and found to be equivalent in terms of both recovery and specific activity.<br>
EXAMPLE 40 — Single hot water extraction at 95°C for 30 minutes<br>
Prior art procedures for the isolation of immunostlmulatory polysaccharides from other types of microalgae (17, 27) typically involve a single hot water extraction at Gd^C for 30 minutes. To evaluate this method, 1g of freeze-dried AFA was extracted once with 20mLs of water at gS"C for 30 minutes. The water extract was adjusted to 80% ethanol and Incubated at -20°C for several hours. The precipitate collected represented a recovery of 12.1% but contained very little NP16847 since the EC50 of this material was about 500ng/mL. Ultrafiltration resulted in a recovery of 5.1% and no change in specific activity. Clearly these conditions are not suitable for extraction of NP16847 from AFA.<br>
EXAMPLE 41 — Water extraction at 4°C followed by re-extraction with 50% ethanol/60°C<br>
It is possible that contaminating polar material can be selectively removed by an initial water extraction without substantial loss of NP16847. A two stage extraction procedure was tested to evaluate this approach. The first stage involved an initial water extraction of AFA at 4°C followed by a second stage re-extraction of AFA at optimal conditions (50% ethanol/60°C). Although the specific activity of NP 16847 using this method was comparable to the optimal conditions alone, the recovery was about 70% less for both pre- and post-ultrafiltrate.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 42 — Water extraction at 23°C followed bv re-extraction with 50% etlianol/60°C<br>
The procedure used in Example 41 was slightly modified by increasing the extraction temperature from 4°C to 23°C. Thus, the first extraction involved an initial water extraction of AFA at 23°C followed by a second stage re-extraction of AFA at optimal conditions (50% ethanol/eO-C). The results were similar to those in Example 41 (i.e. the specific activity was comparable to optimal conditions, yet the recovery was about 70% less for both pre- and post-ultrafiltrate).<br>
EXAMPLE 43 — Water extraction at 40°C followed bv re-extraction with 50% ethanol/60°C<br>
The procedure used in Example 41 was slightly modified by increasing the extraction temperature from 4""C to 40°C. Thus, the first extraction involved an initial water extraction of AFA at 40°C followed by a second stage re-extraction of AFA at optimal conditions (50% ethanol/60°C). The results were similar to those in Example 41 (i.e. the specific activity was comparable to optimal conditions, yet &gt;  the recovery was about 70% less for both pre- and post-ultrafiltrate).<br>
EXAMPLE 44 — Extraction with 70% ethanol/40°C followed bv re-extraction with 50% ethanol/eO"C<br>
It is possible that contaminating non-polar material can be selectively removed by an initial ethanol extraction without substantial loss of NP16847. To evaluate this approach a two stage extraction procedure was tested. The first stage involved an initial extraction of AFA with 70% ethanol at 40°C followed by a second stage re-extraction of AFA at optimal conditions (50% ethanol/60°C). Although this procedure gave a slightly better EC50 value (lOng/mL) than did Examples 24 and 25 for the post-ultrafiltrate NP16847, the recovery was only 1.0%. The pre-ultrafillrate had a recovery of 2.2% with an EC50 value of 20ng/mL.<br>
One property of purified NP16847 was that it appeared to adhere to polypropylene pipette tips. To avoid exaggerated EC50 yalues caused by carryover of the material during serial dilutions, pipette tips were changed between each dilution.<br>

Carbohydrate composition of different NP16847 preparations was . evaluated using GC-mass spectrometry analysis of TMS-methyl glycosides (Table 5). NP16847 material from Example 1 (NP1) was re-analyzed and found to have an identical carbohydrate composition profile as previously detemnined. Since a different batch of AFA (purchased from another company) was used in Examples 4-44 a preparation of NP 16847 was isolated from this new material using the extraction procedure of Example 1 (NP2). Both this NP 16847 preparation and NP1 have a comparable glycosyl composition, indicating consistency between different batches of AFA. The NP2 preparation however, was five times less active than NP1 JTable 5) due to partial loss of active<br><br>
polysaccharides into the n-butanol phase during the n-butanol/water partitioning. In general, similar carbohydrate compositions were also found in pre- and post-ultrafiltrate NP16847 preparations (NP3 - NP6) obtained using optimal extraction conditions (50% ethanol at 60°C and yCC). Pre-ultrafiltrate NP16847 was, however, consistently higher in glucose composition and lower in N-acetylated sugar units than post-ultrafiltrate preparations. Based on the consistency of carbohydrate composition between these different NP16847 preparations (NP1 -NP7), it is clear that the major glycosyl residues present in this material are mannose, rhamnose, arabinose and glucose. In order to identify the O-methylated sugars detected during the TMS-methyl glycoside procedure, glycosyl composition was also determined using alditol acetate analysis. Methylated sugar residues contained in these preparations include 2-methyl rhamnose, 3-methyl rhamnose, 4-methyl rhamnose, 2-methyl fucose, 3-methyl arabinose and 3-methyl mannose. Interestingly, these NP 16847 preparations contain 5.1 -12.5% methylated carbohydrate residues and a high percent of deoxyhexoses (e.g. rhamnose and fucose). Both these characteristics may explain the unusual extractability of NP16847 polysaccharide material using relatively high concentrations of aqueous ethanol.<br>
Because the samples tested (NP1 - NP7) represent up to a 50-fold difference in EC50 values, one would expect to see some difference in carbohydrate composition among them. Since this is not the case, It is obvious that the purity or activity of NP16847 preparations cannot be determined using this parameter. Therefore, NP16847 preparations would more appropriately be characterized by biological activity, size and extractability in aqueous ethanol. It may be that a unique structural feature is responsible for NP16847"s ability to activate monocytes/macrophages rather than a specific carbohydrate composition. It is also possible that the carbohydrate composition of NP1 - NP7 . reflects polysaccharides extractable with aqueous ethanol solutions and immunostimulatory ones would be present as a structural class within this group. This interpretation is supported by the observation that material obtained with hot water extraction (NP8 and NP9) has a very different carbohydrate profile than NP16847 preparations isolated using aqueous ethanol extraction (NP1 - NP7). The predominant glycosyl residue from both pre- and post-ultrafiltrate material obtained from hot water extraction of AFA was glucose (Table 5).    Another<br><br>
distinguishing characteristic of NP8 and NP9 is the lower percent composition of rhamnose as compared wjth NP16847 material isolated using aqueous ethanol extraction.<br>

Following Incubation at -20° C for several hours, precipitates were collected by centrifugation and subsequently washed with cold 95% ethanol. The isolated material was dried under vacuum and dissolved In water at 10mg/mL. This extraction procedure resulted in 1.8% recovery of pre-ultrafiltrate NP16847 preparation and an EC50 value of 75ng/mL in the monocyte activation assay.<br>
EXAMPLE 46 — Extraction with 40% isopropanol at 65°C and direct 80% alcohol precipitation<br>
One g of freeze-dried AFA was extracted at 65° C with 40% isopropanol, first with 7.5mLs for 1 hour and then with 6.25mLs for 1 hour. Supematants from both extractions were combined (11.5mLs) following centrifugation. The isopropanol concentration of the supernatant was adjusted to 80% by the addition of cold 100% isopropanol. Following incubation at -20°C for several hours, precipitates were collected by centrifugation and subsequently washed with cold 95% ethanol. The isolated material was dried under vacuum and dissolved in water at lOmg/mL. This extraction procedure resulted in 12.0% recovery of pre-ultrafiltrate NP 16847 preparation and an EC50 value of lOOng/mL in the monocyte activation assay.<br>
EXAMPLE 47 — Extraction with 100% ethanol bv reflux and precipitation by cooling to -20°C<br>
One g of freeze-dried AFA was extracted by reflux using 100% ethanol, first with S.OmLs for 1 hour and then with 6.50mLs for 1 hour. Supernatants from both extractions were combined (II.OmLs) following centrifugation. Combined supernatant was then stored at -20°C for several hours and precipitable material<br><br>
removed by centrifugation. Precipitate was subsequently washed with washed with cold 95% ethanol. The isolated material was dried under vacuum and dissolved in water at 10mg/mL. This extraction procedure resulted in 0.68% recovery of pre-ultrafiltrate NP16847 preparation and an EC50 value of about 750ng/mL in the monocyte activation assay,<br>
EXAMPLE 48 — Extraction of immunostimulatorv oolvsaccharide material using aqueous alcohol from other food-grade microalqae iChlorella and SplrulJna)<br>
The process of obtaining NP16847 from AFA using an initial extraction with aqueous alcohol, under optimal conditions, results in a preparation that is 20 times more active than material obtained using a hot water extraction (EC50 values for monocyte activation of 25ng/mL verses 500ng/mL, respectively).<br>
The same aqueous alcohol extraction procedure can also be applied to other food-grade microalgae to obtain preparations that are enriched for immunostimulatory polysaccharides. For example, previous patents (16,17,27) have reported that Chlorella species and Spirulina species contain immunostimulatory polysaccharides that are extracted using hot water. However, extraction with aqueous alcohol (instead of hot water) results in selective enrichment for polysaccharides that are immunostimulatory and thereby results in preparations from these organisms that exhibit superior biological activity as well as a higher percent recovery of active material (see experiments below).<br>
The following food-grade microalgae were used in these experiments: Chlorella pyrenoidosa (Sun Chlorella, Lot. No. WS 1422) and Spirulina platensis (Nature"s Way, Lot. No. 912091). All polysaccharide preparations represent pre-ultrafiltrate material. For preparation of hot water extracts, 1g of freeze-dried microalgae was extracted once with 20mLs of water at 95°C for 30 minutes. Hot water extracts were adjusted to 80% ethanol and incubated at -20""C overnight. The precipitate collected from Cf)lorella represented a recovery of 13.2% and an EC50 value of 1,000ng/mL. The precipitate collected from Spirulina represented a recovery of 16.5% and an EC50 value of 10,000ngymL for monocyte/macrophage activation.<br>
Aqueous ethanol extracts were prepared by systematically changing both temperature and solvent concentration (percent ethanol in water) used during the initial extraction.     The endpoints of percent recovery and  EC50 value for<br><br>
macrophage activation were used to determine optimal conditions for preparation of immunostimuiatory polysaccharide material. Chlorella and Spirulina extracts were prepared using the following procedure. One g of freeze-dried microalgae was extracted at the appropriate temperature, first with 7.5mLs of aqueous ethanol solvent for 2 hours and then with 6.25mLs of aqueous ethanol solvent for 2 hours. Supernatants from both extractions were combined (11.3mLs) following centrifugation. The ethanol concentration of the supernatant was adjusted to 80% by the addition of cold 100% ethanol. Following incubation at -20°C for several hours, precipitates were collected by centrifugation and subsequently washed with cold 95% ethanol. The isolated material was dried under vacuum and dissolved in water at 10mg/mL.<br>
The extraction conditions for both optimal recovery and specific activity of immunostimuiatory polysaccharide preparations from Chlorella and Spirulina were similar to the optimal conditions (BO"C - 70°C at 50% ethanol) for extraction of NP16847 from AFA. For Chlorella, optimal conditions for preparation of immunostimuiatory polysaccharide material involve an initial extraction with 50% ethanol at 70° C. This condition yields a pre-ultrafiltrate recovery of 6.5% with an ECso value of 25ng/mL. For Spirulina, optimal conditions for preparation of immunostimuiatory polysaccharide material involve an initial extraction with 40% -50% ethanol at temperatures between 50°C and 70° C. These conditions yield pre-ultrafiltrate recoveries of about 9.0% with EC50 values of 500ng/mL. By comparison, although hot water extracts result in recoveries of about 2 times more material, they are 20 to 40 times less active than the preparations obtained using optimal extraction conditions with aqueous ethanol.<br>
In summary, a simple and effective isolation procedure for optimal recovery of NP16847 from AFA was developed. The optimal extraction method for the pre-ultrafiltrate NP16847 preparation is a direct alcohol precipitation (80% at -20""C) from two pooled extracts of 1 hour each using 50% ethanol at 60°C-70""C. This pre-ultrafiltrate NP16847 preparation represents 11% recovery of AFA dry weight. Using one additional step involving ultrafiltration to exclude all material below 100,000 daltons, a relatively pure preparation of NP16847 polysaccharides can be obtained with recoveries between 4.5% and 5.6%. Both pre- and post-ultrafiltrate preparations have approximately the same EC50 value (25ng/mL for pre-ultrafiltrate and 20na/mL for Dost-ultrafiltrate).   In comparison<br><br>
with the NP16847 material obtained in Example 1 (70% ethanol extraction at 40""C), this optimized post-ultrafiltrate preparation contains between 7.5 and 9.3 times more NP16847 with 5 times greater activity. This procedure is well suited for both a preparation of a dietary supplement (botanical) extract as well as a bulk pharmaceutical product.<br>
The same process described for obtaining immunostimulatory polysaccharide compositions (NP16847) from AFA microalgae can be used to obtain preparations from other microalgae (which include Chlorella species and Spirulina species) that are enriched for immunostimulatory polysaccharides (for example that activate monocytes/macrophages). The unique carbohydrate composition of ail three microalgae polysaccharide preparations allows the use of a procedure that selectively enriches for those that are immunostimulatory. These polysaccharides are extracted very poorly using the traditional hot water extraction procedure. Hot water preparations are 20 to 40 times less active than those using the optimized procedure.<br>
Pharmaceutical Formulations<br>
The present invention further includes low cost bulk polysaccharide preparations. The microalgae from which these polysaccharide preparations are isolated can be grown in tanks similar to current commercial methods that cultivate these microalgae for human consumption. This means that there would not be a supply problem, which is often a major issue for drug development of compounds isolated from natural products. The instant polysaccharide preparations exist in high concentrations (between 6.5% and 11 % of microalgae dry weight) and can be isolated using the simple, fast and low-cost techniques of the present invention.<br>
