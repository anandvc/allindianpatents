				<td>Contact system for a short-circuiting device in a<br>
medium-voltage or high-voltage switchboard plant<br>
Description<br>
The invention relates to a contact system according to<br>
the pre-characterizing clause of Claim 1.<br>
Electrical switchboards for voltages in the range from<br>
1 to 52 kV, which range is generally described as the<br>
medium-voltage range, are designed in the form of<br>
metal-encapsulated gas-insulated switchboards, see DE<br>
43 02 416, in which load isolating switches, earthing<br>
switches and fuses are accommodated as functional<br>
units.<br>
When an arcing fault occurs in a switchboard of this<br>
kind, the effects of the arcing fault must be kept to a<br>
minimum. If the combustion time of such an arcing fault<br>
is appropriately long, the pressure and temperature<br>
within the switchboard can increase to such an extent<br>
that the metal encapsulation can burst or melt; in<br>
order that persons are not injured or even killed as a<br>
result of an uncontrolled outflow of heated gas into<br>
the room in which the switchboard is located, with many<br>
switchboards so-called designated breaking points are<br>
provided in the housing encapsulation through which, in<br>
the event of their breakage, the heated gas flows out<br>
in a controlled manner in a certain defined direction<br>
so that any operating personnel who may be in the room<br>
are not injured. A switchboard is available on the<br>
market, see also DE 31 31 417, in which a short-<br>
circuiting device is provided, which on the occurrence<br>
of an arcing fault short circuits the phases or<br>
connects them to earth so that the short circuit is<br>
diverted as soon as it occurs and the effects of the<br>
arcing fault on the interior of the switchboard are<br>
limited. For this purpose, this switchboard has a<br>
 <br>
pressure sensor, which by means of a storage spring<br>
gearbox brings moving switching contact pieces, which<br>
are designed in the form of contact blades, into<br>
contact with fixed contact pieces situated on the phase<br>
conductors, the drive being designed as a spring drive;<br>
the pressure sensor acts on a latching point, which<br>
releases the drive spring and thus drives the moving<br>
contact pieces into the fixed contact pieces at high<br>
speed, as a result of which the phases are short-<br>
circuited thus suppressing the arc.<br>
With this switchboard, the fixed contact pieces are<br>
exposed within the switchboard so that certain<br>
distances have to be maintained between the fixed<br>
contact pieces and the earthed encapsulation.<br>
As a basic principle, there is a requirement to make<br>
switchboards of this type as compact as possible, as<br>
the available space is limited and therefore expensive.<br>
The object of the invention is to design the fixed<br>
contact pieces of the contact system, which are at high<br>
voltage or medium voltage, in such a way that the<br>
distance between the contact pieces and the<br>
encapsulation or between the contact pieces themselves<br>
can be kept as small as possible.<br>
According to the invention this problem is solved by<br>
the characteristics of Claim 1.<br>
Accordingly, the invention consists in each at least<br>
one fixed contact piece being assigned a screen of<br>
insulating material, which can be penetrated by the<br>
moving contact piece to make contact with the fixed<br>
contact piece when the contact is switched on, the<br>
screen being arranged between the fixed and moving<br>
contact piece.<br>
 <br>
The particular advantage of the invention consists in a<br>
compact contact system for a switchboard being produced<br>
as a result of the embodiment according to the<br>
invention so that overall the switchboard itself has a<br>
smaller space requirement.<br>
At the same time, the arrangement of the screen of<br>
insulating material is chosen so that it is situated<br>
between the at least one fixed contact piece and the<br>
moving contact piece so that, when the moving contact<br>
piece approaches the at least one fixed contact piece,<br>
this does not give rise to a switch-on arc at an early<br>
stage.<br>
According to an advantageous embodiment, the screen can<br>
be designed so that at least the part of the insulating<br>
material, which lies in the movement path of the moving<br>
contact piece, is soft so that the contact piece can<br>
penetrate the material. Of course, it is also possible<br>
for the insulating material to be hard, in which case<br>
it is important however that the thickness of the part,<br>
which lies in the movement path of the moving contact<br>
piece, is dimensioned in such a way that the moving<br>
contact piece can break through this section.<br>
According to a further advantageous embodiment, the<br>
screen can also be formed by a hinged door or flap,<br>
which can be pushed open by the moving contact piece.<br>
The moving contact piece must then be designed so that<br>
it can easily penetrate the insulating material. In a<br>
preferred manner, the moving contact piece can be<br>
designed so that it tapers towards its free end,<br>
wherein, this taper can be in the form of a cone.<br>
It is also possible that the tip, that is to say the<br>
free end, of the moving contact piece is rounded in an<br>
approximately hemispherical manner.<br>
 <br>
According to a particularly advantageous embodiment of<br>
the invention, the at least one fixed contact piece can<br>
be surrounded by a tubular cylinder on which the<br>
penetrable or hinged insulating material is arranged.<br>
If the fixed contact piece is mounted on one end of a<br>
rigid conductor or is formed by its face surface, the<br>
tubular cylinder can extend beyond the fixed contact<br>
piece and be closed by the penetrable insulating<br>
material at its free end.<br>
In this case, the space inside the fixed	tubular<br>
cylinder in which the fixed contact piece is	located<br>
can be filled with insulating fluid, e.g. with	liquid,<br>
in particular with insulating oil.<br>
According to a particularly advantageous embodiment of<br>
the invention, the insulating material assigned to the<br>
fixed contact piece can have an electrically conducting<br>
coating as an electrical screen and/or field control.<br>
When the tubular cylinder is provided, the electrically<br>
conducting coating can be arranged inside the tubular<br>
cylinder.<br>
Advantageous embodiments and improvements of the<br>
invention can be seen in the further dependent claims.<br>
The invention as well as further advantageous<br>
embodiments and improvements and further advantages of<br>
the invention are explained and described in more<br>
detail with reference to the drawing, in which two<br>
exemplary embodiments of the invention are shown.<br>
In the drawings<br>
 <br>
Fig. 1	shows a schematic representation of a<br>
switchboard in which the invention is<br>
realized,<br>
Fig. 2	shows a first embodiment of the<br>
invention, and<br>
Figs 3 and 4 show two further embodiments of the<br>
invention.<br>
A switchboard 10 has a metal housing 11, which is shown<br>
only schematically, the interior 12 of which is filled<br>
with an insulating gas, for example with SF6 gas. Feed<br>
conductors 13 and 14 feed into the switchboard via<br>
suitable ducts, while an outgoing conductor 15 is<br>
arranged between the two feeds 13, 14. Load isolating<br>
switches 16, 17 and 18 are arranged in the feed and<br>
outgoing conductors 13 to 15. Furthermore, short-<br>
circuit switches 19, 20 and 21 are provided, which are<br>
actuated by a latching mechanism 23, the latching<br>
mechanism 23 having a latching point, which can be<br>
released by a sensor 24. In normal operation, the load<br>
isolating switches 16 and 18 may be closed; as a<br>
result, current flows into the switchboard via the feed<br>
conductor 13 and out of the switchboard via the<br>
outgoing conductor 15, for example to a transformer,<br>
which transforms the medium voltage into low voltage.<br>
Naturally it is also possible that the switches 17, 18<br>
are closed and the switch 16 is open. The current then<br>
flows into the switchboard and out of the switchboard<br>
via the feed conductor 14 and the outgoing conductor<br>
15. Of course it is also possible that the conductors<br>
designated with 13 and 15 form the feed conductors and<br>
the conductor 14 the outgoing conductor from the<br>
switchboard; this depends on the external and internal<br>
circuit.<br>
 <br>
Such a. circuit arrangement has also become known as a<br>
so-called Ring Main Unit, and is marketed by the<br>
company ABB AS, Division Kraftprodukter, Skien, Norway.<br>
If an arcing fault 22 occurs in a switchboard of this<br>
kind, the temperature of the insulating gas within the<br>
switchboard 10 and therefore its pressure increase so<br>
that, unless suitable measures are taken, the<br>
switchboard can explode, on account of which the<br>
switchboard can have designated breaking points<br>
according to DE 36 06 770 for example, by means of<br>
which the hot gas can flow out in a systematic and<br>
controlled manner. With the system according to Fig. 1,<br>
which does not have a designated breaking point of this<br>
kind, the increase in pressure is detected by means of<br>
a pressure sensor 24, which releases the latching point<br>
in the latching mechanism 23 and thus closes the<br>
switches 19, 20 and 21, which are open in the normal<br>
state. This produces a short circuit between the<br>
individual phases by means of which the arc 22 is<br>
diverted; because of the short circuit produced in this<br>
way, a superimposed switch, for example a circuit<br>
breaker, trips.<br>
In the case of the Ring Main Unit switchboard produced<br>
by the company ABB AS, Division Kraftprodukter, Skien,<br>
Norway, the individual switches 19, 20 and 21 are<br>
designed as blade contact switches; these blade contact<br>
switches engage in contact blade receptacles, as a<br>
result of which considerable space-saving is achieved.<br>
A reduction in the space required is effected with the<br>
embodiments according to the invention.<br>
Connected to the feed and outgoing conductors 13, 14<br>
and 15 is a rigid conductor 30, to the face side of<br>
which a fixed contact piece 31 in the shape of a tulip<br>
connector is fixed by means of a screw fastener 32. The<br>
 <br>
rigid conductor 30 and the fixed contact piece 31 are<br>
surrounded by a cylindrical tube 33, which extends<br>
beyond the fixed contact piece 31 and is closed at its<br>
free end by means of a cap 34. The cylindrical tube is<br>
made of an insulating material, which if necessary can<br>
be coated on its outside with electrically conducting<br>
material in order to improve the field line<br>
characteristic.<br>
Here, the sealing cap 34 is set into or let into a<br>
recess 35. In the embodiment according to Fig. 2 the<br>
cap 34 is made of silicone material; naturally it is<br>
also possible to make the cap from a rigid material.<br>
It is naturally also possible to provide the coating<br>
with electrically conducting material on the inside of<br>
the cylindrical tube or tubular cylinder 33, wherein<br>
furthermore the coating also continues in the area of<br>
the recess 35.<br>
Assigned to the fixed contact piece 31 is a moving<br>
contact piece 36, which is pushed towards the fixed<br>
contact piece 31 in the direction of the arrow P when<br>
the contact switches on. In order that the moving<br>
contact piece 36 can penetrate the cap 34, the tip 37<br>
of the moving contact piece 36 is designed in the form<br>
of a cone with a tip 38. In this case, the moving<br>
contact piece is connected to earth. It must be added<br>
that in each case there is a total of one contact point<br>
per phase as shown in Fig. 2 for each feed and outgoing<br>
conductor. By means of the moving contact piece 36 the<br>
individual phases can be connected to earth or a phase<br>
short circuit produced, which can likewise be<br>
interrupted by a superimposed circuit breaker.<br>
To improve the electrical field, the moving contact<br>
piece is surrounded by a cylindrical tube 39 made from<br>
electrically conducting material in which the moving<br>
 <br>
contact piece 36 slides; the end of the cylindrical<br>
tube 39 facing the fixed contact piece 31 has a<br>
peripheral bead 40 on the outside, by means of which<br>
the electrical field is uniformly distributed in the<br>
area of the contact point shown in Fig. 2.<br>
The moving contact piece 36 can also execute a circular<br>
movement. For this purpose, an L-shaped arm 41 is fixed<br>
to a rotating shaft 42, which arm 41 merges into a<br>
moving contact piece 43, which corresponds to the<br>
moving contact piece 36. A field control arrangement<br>
such as that shown in Fig. 2 is not shown in the case<br>
of the contact point according to Fig. 3.<br>
With the embodiment according to Fig. 2 a tulip<br>
connector 31 is fixed to the face of the contact piece<br>
30; it is of course also possible to design the face of<br>
the rigid conductor in such a way that it forms a<br>
contact point with the moving contact piece, for<br>
example by making a cone-shaped depression in the face;<br>
in another embodiment the face could be flat and the<br>
tip of the moving contact piece hemispherical.<br>
In the embodiment according to Fig. 3, the conductor 30<br>
is enclosed by a cylindrical tube 44, which has a base<br>
45, the thickness of which is dimensioned so that it<br>
can be easily penetrated by the moving contact piece<br>
43, which naturally can also be the contact piece 36.<br>
As an example, the cylindrical tube 33, 44 can be made<br>
of reusable thermoplastic polymer; the cap 34 can be<br>
made of a soft material such as silicone rubber for<br>
example, which allows the moving contact 36 to<br>
penetrate the cylindrical tube 33. The electrically<br>
conducting coating of the cylindrical tube is provided<br>
on the inside, particularly when the embodiments of the<br>
fixed contact piece are designed in a constructively<br>
simple manner.<br>
 <br>
The embodiment according to the invention has been<br>
described with reference to an electrical switchboard;<br>
it is naturally also possible to install and use the<br>
invention in other installation systems.<br>
The inside of the cylinder 33 or 44 in which the tulip<br>
connector 31 is located can be filled with SF6 gas -<br>
like the environment - or with a liquid insulating<br>
material such as insulating oil or similar.<br>
It is naturally also possible to use the invention in<br>
such contact systems having two fixed contact pieces,<br>
which are bridged by one suitable moving contact piece<br>
to achieve a closure of the contact. In this respect<br>
the invention is not limited to contact systems such as<br>
those described in Figure 2 or Figure 3.<br>
In the embodiment according to Fig. 4 the cap is<br>
designed in the form of a flap 50, which is made of<br>
deformable material, and is fixed to the cylindrical<br>
tube 52 by a kind of film hinge 51; in the event of a<br>
short circuit, the flap 50 is opened by the moving<br>
contact piece and swiveled into the position 50a shown<br>
dotted. Such an arrangement is useful, particularly<br>
when a tulip connector such as the tulip connector 31<br>
is not provided. The flap can also be designed in the<br>
form of a sliding plate, which is actuated by the<br>
moving contact piece.<br>
The term "insulating material", through which the<br>
moving contact piece passes, has the same meaning as<br>
the term "screen", as opposed to the term "electrical<br>
screen", which has the function of a field control.<br>
