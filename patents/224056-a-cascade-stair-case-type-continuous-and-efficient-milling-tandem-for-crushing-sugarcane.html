TITLE:  A  CASCADE  STAIR  CASE  TYPE  CONTINUOUS AND EFFICIENT MILLING TANDEM FOR CRUSHING SUGARCANE<br>
NAME: Mr. Tukaram Mugutrao Karne<br>
ADDRESS: Shreyas Ornate, 95 - Tulasibagwale Colony, Sahkarnagar -2, Pune: 411 009, Maharashtra, India.<br>
NATIONALITY: A SUBJECT OF THE REPUBLIC OF INDIA.<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br>
ORIGINAL<br>
27-8-2008                 GRANTED<br><br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention relates to "CASCADE- MILLING TANDEM FOR CANE SUGAR<br>
INDUSTRY* type sugarcane mill and more particularly to systems for cane crushing mill having several mill units in one milling tandem.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Present modem milling tandems are of non-continuous type. All the mills are set in the horizontal plane, requiring intermediate carriers to convey bagasse from one mill to another mill. The intermediate carriers are trouble some equipment and they need regular maintenance, even then there are breakdowns being occurred regularly, thus the milling process is never continuous. The machinery and equipment in the other sections in the sugar factory have stand by units therefore there are no stoppages, except at the milling tandem which are considerable.<br>
Headstocks are designed to accommodate three rollers one at top and two at the bottom, which are set at right angles or inclined by 15° to the vertical line passing through center of top roller.<br>
An apex angle is un-timited varying from 72° to 85° tor different existing modem mill designs. Therefore these angles created either problem of un-controlled variable mill settings in operation or created very high factional losses respectively.<br>
The juice re-maceration in a compound type imbibition system is occurring in the presence of air. Therefore a huge quantity of air is occluded by the emerging bagasse from each mill, thus making inefficient mixing efficiency of re-maceration juice / imbibition water with bagasse.<br>
Application of higher rate of imbibition water on fiber become impossible due to poor drainage of extracted juice and thus juice flooded on the top roller is passed ahead to the mill bagasse affecting the mill extraction to the great extent. The Lotus type perforations practiced on top rollers, few decades ago, created serious effects on the moisture of each mill bagasse due to re-absorption of juice returning back from nozzles and proceeding to bagasse very fast by gravitational force. This re-absorption phenomenon of juice occurring affected the mill extraction to the great extent.<br>
Juke drainage from feed, top and discharge rollers is very limited resulting in the poor milling efficiency.<br>
Passing bagasse, wherever there occurred low-pressure zones under hydraulic pressure, reabsorbs juice extracted by Lotus type top roller. Pair of TRPF rollers provided for pressure feeding consumed more power and there is no advantage of juice drainage, in this system. Wet cush-cush added in front of mill no.2 created several problems for mill no.2 and affected the milling performance to the great extent<br><br><br>
DESCRIPTION:-<br>
Ail   the   mills  in   "CASCADE-   MILLING  TANDEM   FOR  CANE  SUGAR<br>
INDUSTRY" are set in the inclined plane to form a cascade-staircase type-milling tandem, achieving gravity bagasse conveying from one mill to another. The shape of mill tandem looks like a triangle. Therefore power is saved; maintenance and breakdown stoppages are also totally avoided. This has resulted in a continuous milling process, as there are no intermediate carriers. The bagasse is conveyed from mill to mill by gravitational force. It becomes a continuous milling tandem, as quick mill by pass systems [QMBS] are also installed as an integral part for repairs, maintenance, up gradation and resetting of any mill unit without stopping the process of milling. Headstocks are inclined by 14° to 17".<br>
An apex angle of mill is limited to 77° to 83°, which will give moderate width of trash plate, minimize power losses and avoid wear and tear. Individual DC motor drive and compact enclosed two sets of helical gearboxes will simplify process of continuous milling and reduce cost on foundations. Total quantities of lighter re-maceration juice wilt be fully taken on the each mill bagasse to form a bath trough to dilute sugar in the emerging out bagasse from each mill.<br>
Sealed bath juice re-maceration and imbibition water will provide air-free dilution of mill bagasse, by emerging bagasse of each mill unit in a juice seal bath trough to improve the mill extraction to the higher level.<br>
Application of higher rate of undivided imbibition water on fiber® 250 to 350% will give higher mill extraction.<br>
Quick juice drain facility is provided for the rollers of TRPF and Feed and Discharge rollers of mill, therefore there will be no juice flooding on top rollers and no passage of flooded juice to mill bagasse. The moisture of bagasse of each mill will be reduced to the great extent achieving very high mill extraction. Single perforated TRPF roller is provided with profile curved pressure feed chute to give positive pressure feeding to the mill and will achieve improvement in the juice drainage.<br>
Dried cush-cush will be shifted and added on prepared cane before first primary mill unit to improve the juice brix curves and achieve very high mill extraction. The Donnelly chute wilt be of very shorter @1.5m height reducing size of the milling tandem and also achieving sufficient gravity pressure feeding head to the TRPF and mill.<br>
The base of last mill no.5 will be installed at the ground level to reduce the height of the milling tandem and will minimize cost on foundations. There will be two rake cane carriers to convey prepared sugar cane, both sets installed on the raits side by side, one in operation and another always standby for emergency stoppage of one in operation. The standby rake cane carrier will be just pushed in the place of broken operational one and milling process can be resumed within the period of frve minutes.<br><br><br>
CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATION OF THE CASCADE- MILLING TANDEM FOR CANE SUGAR INDUSTRY<br>
A milling tandem in the sugar industry is a juice extraction process where well-prepared sugar cane IPC (Incoming prepared cane) by cane preparatory devices is crushed to take out juice to the maximum possible level to improve the mill extraction to the highest possible level. The FB (final bagasse) contains lowest possible sugar, water and fiber. It proceeds to the steam generation boilers to produce steam required for power generation and processing sugar juice In the boiling house.<br>
The well DCC (dried cush-cush) separated from the raw juice is dropped in the well-prepared incoming sugar cane. The prepared cane IPC (Incoming prepared cane) comes to the first mill Ml (Mill 1) conveyed by the cane carrier. The Juice of Ml (Mill 1) and M2 (Mill 2) are mixed and sent to the screening station. The screened juice goes to the sugar-juice boiling process.<br>
The maximum possible juice is extracted from the prepared sugar cane in the first mill Ml (Mill 1). The first mill extraction called primary mill extraction is improved to the highest possible level with the help of perforated toothed roller under pressure feeder PTRUF (Perforated toothed roller under Pressure feeder ). The juice is also drained out from the PTRUF (Perforated toothed roller under Pressure feeder). The top roller TR (Top roller) is normal but feed roller PFR (Perforated feed roller) has a perforated shell to drain out the extracted juice efficiently with the gravitational force. The sugar cane IPC (Incoming prepared cane) is then leads to the further compression by a pair of top and feed rollers for further juice extraction. The juice extracted by the pair of top and feed rollers is drained efficiently by the perforations made on the feed roller PFR (Perforated feed roller). Then the cane proceeds further to the pair of top TR (Top roller) and discharge rollers PDR (Perforated discharge roller) for further juice extraction, with the guidance of TP (Trash plate). The juice is extracted and drained out efficiently with the help of perforations provided on the shell of discharge roller.<br>
The dry bagasse MB1 coming out from the primary Ml (Mill 1) is allowed to emerge in the flooded bath of remaceration juice coming back from M3 (Mill 3) for the dilution of sugar left in the primary mill bagasse. The dilution of primary mill bagasse becomes fast because the J3 (Juice 3) coming from M3 (Mill 3) is having less sugar than that of primary bagasse. This called as remaceration in the compound imbibition system to enhance the efficiency of mill extraction process.<br><br><br>
The remacerated primary mill bagasse goes the mill no.2 M2 (Mill 2) and this way the process of re-extraction is continued in the similar manner at following mills M2 (Mill 2), M3 (Mill 3), M4 (Mill 4) and MS (Mill 5).<br>
ZW (Imbibition water) is added in the penultimate bagasse coming out from M4 (Mill 4) to enhance the mill extraction efficiency to the highest possible level.<br>
The QMBS (Quick mill by pass system) allows making a milling process continuous by bypassing any mill unit, which is facing problems, breakdowns or requiring adjustments.<br>
The beauty of the newly invented milling tandem is in the setting of all the mills in the tandem in a cascade staircase shape to take the advantage of gravitational force to convey the bagasse from one mill to another. The shape of mill foundation becomes triangular having base angle 0 within the range of 45° to 60°. This way it becomes a cascade staircase type continuous and efficient milling tandem.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, the well dried cush-cush DCC (2) separated from the raw juice is dropped in the well-prepared incoming sugar cane. The prepared cane IPC (1) comes to the first mill Ml (3) conveyed by the cane carrier. The Juice of Ml (3) and M2 (4) are mixed and sent to the screening station. The screened juice goes to the sugar-juice boiling process. The first mill extraction called primary mill extraction is improved to the highest possible level with the help of perforated toothed roller under pressure feeder PTRUF (5). The juice is also drained out from the PTRUF (5). The top roller TR (6) is normal but feed roller PFR (7) has a perforated shell to drain out the extracted juice efficiently with the gravitational force. The sugar cane IPC (1) is then leads to the further compression by a pair of top and feed rollers for further juice extraction. The juice extracted by the pair of top and feed rollers is drained efficiently by the perforations made on the feed roller PFR (7). Then the cane<br><br><br>
proceeds further to the pair of top TR (6) and discharge rollers PDR (8) for<br>
further juice extraction, with the guidance of trash plate TP.<br>
The dry bagasse MB coming out from the primary mill Ml (3) is allowed to<br>
emerge in the flooded bath of remaceration juice coming back from mill no.3 M3<br>
(9) for the dilution of sugar left in the primary mill bagasse. The dilution of<br>
primary mill bagasse becomes fast because the juice J3 (10) coming from mill<br>
no.3 M3 (9) is having less sugar than that of primary bagasse.<br>
The remacerated primary mill bagasse goes the mill no.2 M2 (4) and this way<br>
the process of re-extraction is continued in the similar manner at following mills<br>
M2 (4), M3 (9), M4 (11) and M5 (12).<br>
Imbibition hot water IW (13) is added in the penultimate bagasse coming out<br>
from mill no.4 M4 (11) to enhance the mill extraction efficiency to the highest<br>
possible level.<br>
The FB (19) contains lowest possible sugar, water and fiber.<br>
The QMBS (20) allows making a milling process continuous by bypassing any<br>
mill unit, which is facing problems, breakdowns or requiring adjustments.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, which is the diagrammatic representation of one mill unit, the well dried cush-cush DCC (2) separated from the raw juice is dropped in the well-prepared incoming sugar cane. The prepared cane IPC (1) comes to perforated toothed roller under pressure feeder PTRUF (5). The top roller TR (6) is normal but feed roller PFR (7) has a perforated shell to drain out the extracted juice efficiently with the gravitational force. Then the cane proceeds further to the pair of top TR (6) and discharge rollers PDR (8) for further juice extraction, with the guidance of trash plate TP (9). The dry bagasse MB (13) coming out from the mill M (3) is allowed to emerge in the flooded bath of remaceration juice 3/IW (10) coming back from mill. The remacerated primary mill bagasse Bl (11) goes the other mill. The QMBS (20) helps milling process to make it continuous by bypassing mill M (3) in case of breakdown of mill M (3).<br><br><br>
