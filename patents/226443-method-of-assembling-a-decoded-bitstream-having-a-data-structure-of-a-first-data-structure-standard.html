				<td>The invention relates to a method and to an apparatus for<br>
evaluating for-the purpose of decoding a bitstream having a<br>
data structure fulfilling the requirements of two different<br>
data structure Standards, and relates to a compatible storage<br>
medium containing such bitstream and to a method for<br>
compatibly assembling such bitstream.<br>
Background<br>
There are different types of DVD (digital versatile disc)<br>
systems, for instance the replay-only DVD-Video system and<br>
the re-recordable DVD-VR system. DVD-Video is specified in:<br>
DVD Specification for Read-Only Disc, Part 3, Video Specifications,<br>
Version 1.0, August 1996.<br>
DVD-VR is specified in: DVD Specification for Rewritable/Re-<br>
recordable Discs, Part 3, Video Recording, Version 1.0, September<br>
1999.<br>
The corresponding bitstreams have different formats and different<br>
content.<br>
WO-A-00 02195 discloses a DVD compatible with the DVD-Video<br>
standard and the DVD-RTR standard. The contents data is<br>
stored in separate directories and files.<br>
EP-A-0 944 087 shows a DVD containing audio/video information<br>
and audio information, wherein for each type of player<br>
different navigation information is recorded for the same<br>
object.<br>
Invention<br>
A DVD-VR type disc containing a DVD-VR type bitstream is to<br>
be replayed on a DVD-VR type recorder or player. However, it<br>
is also possible to record a DVD-Video type bitstream on a<br>
DVD-VR type disc in a DVD-VR type recorder, for replay of<br>
that disc in a DVD-Video type player.<br>
Because the DVD-VR and DVD-Video formats are not compatible<br>
with each other and a disc containing a bitstream of the one<br>
type can not be replayed on a player of the otter type, a user must make a choice of<br>
which type of bitstream recording on a disc.<br>
One solution to this problem would be to record a separate disc for each type of<br>
bitstream.<br>
The problem to be solved by the invention is to make the required processing easier in<br>
order to free a user from me decision about which type of bitstream is to be recorded The<br>
problem is solved by the method, me apparatus, and the storage device according to the<br>
features of the invention.<br>
According to the invention a special type of bitstream is assembled and recorded on a<br>
disc mat can be replayed on bom types of players. This special type of bitstream is<br>
compatible with the DVD-Video system as well as the DVD-VR system. The reason for<br>
mis compatibility is that the header of a date pack contain an information about the type<br>
of data contained in me payioad of me pack A data type unusable for, or unknown to, a<br>
specific type of player is not evaluated by that type of player. For both systems,<br>
corresponding additional files are added to their specific directories, but the resulting<br>
bitstream for bom system types represents me same identical file on the disc.<br>
A disc containing a bitstream having the inventive date structure can be replayed by bora,<br>
DVD-VR and DVD-Video players. Even first-generation DVD players can replay such<br>
discs.<br>
In principle, me inventive method is suited for evaluating for me purpose of decoding a<br>
bitstream having a date structure fulfilling the requirements of a first date structure<br>
standard, me date of which bitstream include first main overhead date and multiple date<br>
units. each date unit con-..............................................................................<br>

Drawings<br>
Exemplary embodiments of the invention are described with<br>
reference to the accompanying drawings, which show in:<br>
Fig. 1 inventive data structure for a DVD-VR disc storing<br>
DVD-Video and DVD-VR data;<br>
Fig. 2 structure of a bitstream on a disc according to Fig.<br>
1;<br>
Fig. 3 different structure of a bitstream for a disc according<br>
to Fig. 1;<br>
Fig. 4 simplified block diagram of a DVD-Video or DVD-VR<br>
player.<br>
Exemplary embodiments<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, following Lead_In and File_Systems_Data<br>
two additional directories are inserted into the DVD-VR/<br>
Video root directory: VIDEO_TS for DVD-Video and DVD_RTAV<br>
for DVD-VR.<br>
All necessary files for the two systems are generated:<br>
- for DVD-VR VR_MAGR.IFO, VR_MAGR.BUP, VR_AUDIO.VRO;<br>
- for DVD-Video VIDEOJTS.IFO, VIDEOJTS.BUP and possibly<br>
VIDEO_TS.VOB.<br>
However, the kernel AV stream (audio/video stream) that is<br>
described by the files VTS_xx_y.VOB for the DVD-Video system<br>
and VR_MOVIE.VRO and VR_STILL.VRO for the DVD-VR system, is<br>
the same bitstream, i.e. physically the DVD-Video and DVD-VR<br>
bitstreams are by only one stream.<br>
To provide such feature the bitstream must have specific<br>
properties. Some of these properties are compelling, other<br>
properties are optional.<br>
A corresponding bitstream structure as depicted in Fig. 2 is<br>
optimised with respect to compatibility with DVD-Video and<br>
DVD-VR. Fig. 2 shows that the DVD-VR video object units<br>
(VOBU) are shifted with respect to the DVD-Video video ob-<br>
ject units: DVD-Video video object units begin with a navi-<br>
gation pack NV_PCK whereas DVD-VR video object units end<br>
with a navigation pack NV_PCK that represents the beginning<br>
of the next DVD-Video video object unit.<br>
A navigation pack NV_PCK is followed by a real-time data in-<br>
formation pack RDI_PCK, several video packs VPCK, several<br>
subpicture packs SP_PCK, and several audio packs A_PCK.<br>
NV_PCK is used by DVD-Video only, RDI_PCK is used by DVD-VR<br>
only, V_PCK and SP_PCK and APCK are commonly used by DVD-<br>
Video and DVD-VR.<br>
Mandatory properties are:<br>
a) Navigation Packs NV_PCK must point in the stream to the<br>
beginning of each VOBU according to the DVD-Video stan-<br>
dard, Part 3, Chapters 2.4.47, 4.6 and 5.2.2.<br>
b) Real-time Data Information Packs RDI_PCK must point in<br>
the stream to the beginning of each VOBU according to the<br>
DVD-VR standard, Part 3, Chapters 2.4 and 5.4.4.<br>
c) The MPEG Video stream must have such values for horizon-<br>
tal_size only that are allowed for DVD-Video as well as<br>
for DVD-VR: 720, 704 and 352, but not 480 and 544 that<br>
are allowed in DVD-VR only, see DVD-Video standard, Part<br>
3, Chapter 5.4.1.2 and DVD-VR standard, Part 3, Chapter<br>
5.5.1.2.<br>
d) In case an audio stream is to be accepted under DVD-VR<br>
for Still Picture (e.g. menus), it must have the stream<br>
number '1'. In case an audio stream is to be accepted un-<br>
der DVD-VR for normal video (i.e. not Still Picture), it<br>
must have the stream number '0' to keep compatibility<br>
with DVD-VR, see DVD-Video, Part 3, Chapter 5.2.4 and<br>
DVD-VR, Part 3, Chapter 5.3.3.<br>
e) For Linear Audio streams (PCM streams) '0' and '1', quan-<br>
tisation_word_length = 00b (16 bits) is to be used only<br>
to keep compatibility with DVD-VR,, see DVD-Video, Part 3,<br>
Table 5.2.4-1, Note 8 and DVD-VR, Part 3, Table 5.3.3-1,<br>
Note 8.<br>
f) For Linear Audio streams (PCM streams) '0' and '1', audio<br>
_sampling_frequency = 00b (48 kHz) is to be used only to<br>
keep compatibility with DVD-VR, see DVD-Video, Part 3,<br>
Table 5.2.4-1, Note 9 and DVD-VR, Part 3, Table 5.3.3-1,<br>
Note 9.<br>
g) To allow for DVD-Video and DVD-VR the common use of<br>
streams '0' or '1' for Linear Audio, only the values<br>
0000b (mono) and 0001b (stereo) can be used for number_of<br>
_audio_channels, see DVD-Video, Part 3, Table 5.2.4-1,<br>
Note 10 and DVD-VR, Part 3, Table 5.3.3-1, Note 10.<br>
Alternatively, if for DVD-Video only PCM audio streams<br>
having a stream number greater '1' are used, then also<br>
the value 1001b (dual mono) for number_of_audio_channels<br>
of linear audio streams '0' or '1' can be used.<br>
h) If a subpicture stream is to be handled under DVD-VR as<br>
well as DVD-Video, then it must have the stream number<br>
'0' to keep compatibility with DVD-VR, see DVD-Video,<br>
Part 3, Chapter 5.2.5 and DVD-VR, Part 3, Chapter 5.3.4.<br>
From a) and b) it follows that no DVD-Video VOBU exists that<br>
starts with the same sector as a DVD-VR VOBU. Corresponding-<br>
ly, the same is true for each DVD-VR VOBU. Besides this,<br>
there exist sectors NV_PCK in the stream that are used only<br>
from a DVD-Video system and sectors RDI_PCK that are used<br>
only from a DVD-VR system, as mentioned above.<br>
Optional properties are:<br>
A) The use of audio streams having stream numbers &gt; 1. Such<br>
audio streams can be decoded by DVD-Video players only<br>
and may therefore fully match the DVD-Video standard<br>
specification, i.e. there is no limitation of allowed<br>
features due to DVD-VR requirements.<br>
B) The use of subpictures having stream numbers &gt; 1. Subpic-<br>
ture streams having a stream number &gt; 0 can be decoded<br>
according to the DVD-Video standard only.<br>
C) The use of audio streams having stream numbers &gt; 1. More<br>
than one audio stream may exist. However, audio stream<br>
numbers '0' and '1' must not co-exist in parallel in a<br>
DVD-VR VOBU in order to avoid conflicts with DVD-VR.<br>
D) For Linear Audio (PCM) streams having stream numbers &gt; 1,<br>
the parameters quantization_word_length, audio_sampling_<br>
frequency and number_of_audio_channels may correspond to<br>
all possible values given in the DVD-Video standard DVD-<br>
VR. There is no limitation of allowed values due to DVD-<br>
VR requirements.<br>
E) For audio streams having a stream numbers &gt; 1 all audio<br>
formats are allowed that are supported by the DVD-Video<br>
standard, e.g. DTS coding format. There is no limitation<br>
due to DVD-VR requirements.<br>
F) The MPEG Video stream may use for horizontal_size the<br>
values 480 and 544 that are allowed for DVD-VR, if the<br>
corresponding video packs are used by DVD-VR VOBUs only,<br>
but not by DVD-Video VOBUs, see DVD-Video specification,<br>
Part 3, Chapter 5.4.1.2 and DVD-VR specification, Part 3,<br>
Chapter 5.5.1.2.<br>
G) In user_data() fields in the picture layer of video<br>
streams teletext information corresponding to the DVD-VR<br>
specification may be contained. Such user data fields<br>
could contain for example subpicture information, the<br>
content of which subpicture information would be identical<br>
with the content of a second subpicture stream.<br>
The bitstream structure depicted in Fig. 3 is more complex<br>
than that depicted in Fig. 2. In the VOBUs there are several<br>
additional subpicture and audio packs assigned to further<br>
stream numbers '1' to '4'. However, only the subpicture and<br>
audio packs that are assigned to stream '0' are used by a<br>
DVD-VR device. This specific bitstream structure is less<br>
compatible with DVD-VR, but emphasises the specific features<br>
of DVD-Video and DVD-VR.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention the kernel AV<br>
stream contains, beside the above described part common to<br>
DVD-VR and DVD-Video, a specific part or specific parts that<br>
are used for DVD-VR and DVD-Video only and to which the corresponding<br>
root directories, i.e. said first or second main<br>
overhead data, facilitate access.<br>
Fig. 4 shows an optical disk D, which is driven by a motor M<br>
and from which data are read by means of a pick-up P. These<br>
data are fed in conditioned form, for example after amplification<br>
and error correction, to a track buffer TB via an input<br>
DMA (direct memory access) controller IDMA. The data are<br>
stored in buffer TB in order to compensate for instantaneous<br>
or short-term data rate variations. The corresponding partial<br>
data streams of the buffer-stored data stream are re-<br>
copied from the track buffer TB in each case into an associated<br>
decoder: a video decoder VID for MPEG video data, an<br>
audio decoder AUD for MPEG or AC3 audio data, and a subpicture<br>
decoder for subpicture data. Such decoders require a<br>
dedicated bit buffer in order to access specific data in a<br>
specific order at specific time instants. Therefore, the<br>
data for a data decoder must be available in the output data<br>
stream in a combination and/or order that possibly differs<br>
from the input data stream. Since current device architectures<br>
may demand a decoder bit buffer comprising a single<br>
coherent memory area, the data initially stored in the track<br>
buffer can be re-copied into the bit buffer for the respective<br>
decoder by means of an output DMA controller ODHA in<br>
the required order and at the required time instant. IDMA,<br>
ODMA and other stages can be controlled by a common processor<br>
mP or by separate processors. In a DVD-VR player the<br>
subpicture decoder may be replaced by a teletext decoder. A<br>
DVD-VR recorder will additionally include corresponding<br>
video, audio and teletext encoders and means for writing encoded<br>
bitstream data on disc D.<br>
The bitstream can be stored for example on a DVD-RAM or DVD-<br>
RW or DVD+RW or DVD-R or DVD-ROM disc, or can have the corresponding<br>
format.<br>
Instead of a DVD disc, any other storage medium can be used.<br>
It is also possible to send a bitstream according to the inventive<br>
data structure from a transmitter to a receiver,<br>
which decodes the received bitstream according to one or the<br>
other DVD system type.<br>
A further feature is to decode such received or replayed<br>
bitstreams according to both DVD system types, thereby using<br>
the particular features of the DVD-Video format, e.g. of<br>
having up to 32 sub-pictures, together with the particular<br>
features of the DVD-VR format, e.g. teletext.<br>

This invention relates to a different types of DVD systems, e.g. the replay-only<br>
DVD-Video system and the re-recordable DVD-VR system. A DVD-VR type disc<br>
containing a DVD-VR type bitstream is to be replayed on a DVD-VR type recorder<br>
or player. However, it is also possible to record a DVD-Video type bitstream on a<br>
DVD-VR type disc in a DVD-VR type recorder, for replay of that disc in a DVD-<br>
Video type player. A special type of bitstream is assembled and recorded on a<br>
disc that can be replayed on both types of players. This special type of bitstream<br>
is compatible with the DVD-Video system as well as the DVD-VR system. For<br>
