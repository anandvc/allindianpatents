EMBRYONIC STEM CELLS INTO ENDOTHELIAL CELLS<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims priority from U. S. Provisional Patent Application No.<br>
60/335,332 filed November 2,2001.<br>
STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT<br>
[0002] To be determined.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003] Stem cells are defined to be cells which are capable both of self-renewal and<br>
differentiation into one or more differentiated cell types. Human embryonic stem cells are a<br>
category of stem cells created from human pre-implantation blastocysts. Human embryonic stem<br>
cells are pluripotent and may be totipotent, meaning that they can certainly differentiate into<br>
many cell types evidenced in an adult human body and may be capable of differentiating into all<br>
cell types present in the human body.<br>
[0004] Embryonic stem cells (ES cells) have also been derived in a number of animals<br>
other than humans. For example, much scientific work has been conducted with murine ES cells.<br>
Once a method for the initiation of ES cell cultures for a particular species is worked out, it<br>
becomes possible to manipulate the ES cells, and animals which result therefrom, in a variety of<br>
ways to learn useful information about the genetics of the animal under study. For example, it<br>
has become possible over the past decade to create cultures of murine ES cells in which one or<br>
another specific gene is knocked out in each murine stem cell culture. While some techniques<br>
that could be worked out in murine ES cell systems were transferable to other species, many<br>
were not. For example, the basic techniques which could be used to create murine ES cell<br>
cultures did not transfer well to many other animal species. For the development of techniques<br>
for the culture and manipulation of human ES cells, the murine cell may therefore not be the best<br>
model due to the phylogenic distance between humans and mice. However, in the course of the<br>
development of the science of human ES cell cultures and techniques, much of the preliminary<br>
work was conducted in non-human primates, such as the rhesus monkey. Other primate ES cell<br>
cultures have proven to be a relatively reliable model for systems that could be easily transferred<br>
to human cell culture. For an example, murine ES cell cultures require application of leukemia<br>
inhibitory factor (LIF) or another agonist of the gpl30/STAT3 signaling pathway for<br>
maintenance of undifferentiated cell growth, whereas human and rhesus monkey ES cell cultures<br>
do not require LIF for undifferentiated cell growth. Prior work on hematopoiesis using rhesus<br>
monkey ES cells validates the utility of this system for doing pre-clinical investigations for<br>
techniques mat can be transferred to human ES cell cultures.<br>
[0005] One of me exciting potential uses of stem cells is for human tissue transplantation.<br>
It is hoped and expected that techniques can be developed to direct the differentiation of stem<br>
cells into specific lineages which can then be transferred into the human body to replace or<br>
enhance tissues of the body. In order to do that, first techniques must be developed to direct the<br>
differentiation of stem cells into the specific cell lineages desired. Techniques have already been<br>
proposed to direct stem cell cultures into lineages of hematopoeic, neural, cardiomyocyte,<br>
pancreatic and other lineages. These techniques have proven to be quite different from each<br>
other and independent in the sense that a new and different technique is required for each new<br>
desired lineage.<br>
[00061 Endothelial cells make up a network of interconnected cells in the human body<br>
that line blood vessels, lymphatic vessels, and form capillaries. Endothelial cells regulate the<br>
flow of nutrient substances and create and respond to diverse biologically active molecules.<br>
While it has been demonstrate that human ES cells will differentiate into many progeny cells<br>
types, including endothelial cells, it has not been previously possible to create distinct cultures of<br>
derivatives of human ES cells directed into an endothelial lineage.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[00071 The present invention is summarized in that a method has been developed which<br>
permits the direct differentiation of a culture of embryonic stem cells into a culture of endothelial<br>
cells. The method includes culturing the embryonic stem cells in a culture medium previously<br>
known to maintain endothelial cells and which, it now turns out, has the capability to support<br>
embryonic stem cells in the process of differentiation into endothelial cells.<br>
[0008] The present invention is also summarized in that cultures of endothelial cells<br>
derived from embryonic stem cells which have morphology and cell surface markers<br>
characteristic of endothelial cells and which are capable of inducing vascularization of tissue <br><br>
vivo-<br>
[0009] it is a feature of the present invention in that it is relatively efficient to perform<br>
since its steps are simple, and the result is a culture that appears to be a relatively homogenous<br>
population of endothelial cells.<br>
[00010] Other objects, advantages and features of the present invention will become<br>
apparent from the following specification when taken in conjunction with the accompanying<br>
drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL VIEWS OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Not applicable.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[00011] The Present invention is directed both to a method to direct the differentiation of<br>
primate embryonic stem cells into endothelial cells and to the relatively pure population of<br>
endothelial cells so produced. The method is based on the cultivation of primate embryonic stem<br>
cells with a defined protein growth factor or factors which cause the cells so treated to change<br>
their morphology to become endothelial cells. In contrast to other techniques for the directed<br>
differentiation of cells of other lineages from embryonic stem cells, the culture of endothelial<br>
cells, derived from embryonic stem cells by the method described here, appears relatively<br>
uniform and is made up of primarily of endothelial cells having apparent angiogenic capability.<br>
[00012] The culture method is based on the culture of undifferentiated primate embryonic<br>
stem (ES) cells in a medium containing vascular endothelial cell growth factors (VEGF), basic<br>
fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1), and epidermal growth factor<br>
(EGF). These factors are all found in a commercially available medium known as endothelial<br>
cell basal medium (EBM-2, Clonetics/BioWhittaker). This medium was previously known and is<br>
used to sustain endothelial cells in culture. It was not previously known that this medium could<br>
be used to support the differentiation of ES cells into endothelial cells. While this combination<br>
of growth factors has been found to be sufficient to support the differentiation of ES cells into<br>
endothelial cells, it may not be necessary to use all four factors in the culture medium, and<br>
whether or not one of the factors can be omitted can readily be ascertained by empirical<br>
experimentation without departing from the concept of the present invention.<br>
[00013] What separates this method from prior art derivation of heterogeneous mixtures<br>
including endothelial cells is the relative uniformity of the transition of the cell culture from ES<br>
cells to endothelial cells. Other methods were tried, without success, to achieve this transition,<br>
such as application of phorbol esters, co-cultivation with stromal cells plus serum and isolation of<br>
endothelial cells from embryoid bodies. None of these efforts reproducibly yielded cultures of<br>
predominantly endothelial cells. In contrast, the method described here is simple and efficient<br>
and results in a cell culture of morphologically similar cells having the characteristics of<br>
endothelial cells.<br>
[00014] The culture of endothelial cells made by the present invention will have certain<br>
characteristics. The cells have a characteristic morphology, similar to elongated or stellate<br>
shaped endothelial cells. In contrast, ES cells grown in other media differentiate into a<br>
heterogeneous population of cell types with no distinct endothelial-appearing cells. The<br>
endothelial cells rapidly form tubular structures when placed in Matrigel (™) medium. The<br>
endothelial cells are positive for presence of the von Willebrand factor (vWF) and have high<br>
levels of ulex europaeus agglutinin 1 (UEA-1) binding, as well as expression of the intergrin<br>
avß3 and the surface antigen CD 146. These cells also will take up acetylated LDL, another trait<br>
characteristic of endothelial cells. These cells do lack expression of CD31 and VE-cadherin, two<br>
antigens commonly, but not always, present on the surface of endothelial cells. These<br>
endothelial cells have the ability, when transferred into a SCID (severe combined<br>
immunodeficient) mouse together with tumor cells, to effect the vascularization of the resulting<br>
tumor, thus demonstrating the ability of the cells both to recruit and to participate in<br>
vascularization in vivo. The ability of these cell to participate in vascularization is particularly<br>
noteworthy, since that attribute makes in possible to transplant genetically altered endothelial<br>
cells into a tissue requiring vascularization with the altered cells surviving in vivo in the vascular<br>
matrix created to therefore express whatever gene was inserted into the cells.<br>
[00015] In contrast to other cell types which can be induced to form from embryonic stem<br>
cells, the endothelial cell culture described and characterized here is relatively homogenous in<br>
cells committed to the derivative lineage, i.e. to be endothelial cells. The ES derived endothelial<br>
cell culture is formed of cells having a uniform morphology and exhibiting the characteristics of<br>
endothelial cells. Given the limits of present cell culture technology, however, it cannot be said<br>
with certainty that the ES derived endothelial cell culture is entirely free of other cell types.<br>
What can be said is that the ES derived endothelial cell culture is predominantly composed of<br>
endothelial cells and is a practical source of cells which will act as endothelial cells to promote<br>
and participate in vascularization of tissues when transplanted into a host in vivo- Using a<br>
common test for endothelial character, the ability to bind the Ulex europaeus agglutinin 1 (UEA-<br>
1) lectin, it has been found that reproducible over 90% of the cells in the derivative culture do<br>
bind the UEA-1 lectin. While in some variations of the method the percentage of cells which<br>
bind to UEA-1 might vary, in cultures of endothelial cells made by the method described here, at<br>
least 75%, and more preferably, over 90%, of the cells in the culture will test positive for the<br>
ability to bind the UEA-1 lectin.<br>
[00016] While the examples below were conducted with rhesus monkey ES cells, the same<br>
processes and result can be obtained with human ES cells. Human endothelial cells derived from<br>
ES cells offer the possibility to develop tissues transplantable into human patients.<br>
Transplantation of endothelial cells would be desirable for those applications in which<br>
vascularizarion of ischemic tissue is needed. In addition, the introduction of endothelial cells<br>
may be useful in any location on the body where improved vascularization is needed. Since the<br>
precursor ES cells can be grown in any number, this makes possible the generation of large<br>
numbers of endothelial cells for clinical experimentation or treatment.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
[00017] METHODS<br>
[00018] Cell Culture<br>
[00019] Undifferentiated rhesus monkey ES cells (R366.4 cell line) were cultured as<br>
previously described (Thomson et al. Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 92:7844-7848 (1996)). Briefly<br>
R366.4 cells were co-cultured with irradiated mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells in<br>
medium containing DMEM, 20% FBS (Hyclone, Ogden UT), 2mM L-glutamine (Sigma, St.<br>
Louis, MO), O.1mM 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma), and 1% MEM non-essential amino acids<br>
(Invitrogen). Undifferentiated cells were fed daily with fresh medium and passaged onto new<br>
MEFs approximately every 5-7 days. To promote endothelial cell differentiation, the medium<br>
was removed from the ES cells 24 hours after plating and replaced with medium consisting of<br>
EGM2, 5% FBS, VEGF, bFGF, IGF-1, EGF, and ascorbic acid (EGM2) (EGM2-MV Bullet Kit,<br>
Clonetics/BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD). The ES cells were differentiated for 29 days in the<br>
EGM2 medium, which was changed every 3-5 days. Differentiated rhesus ES cells, were<br>
dissociated with 0.05% trypsin/0.53mM EDTA (GIBCO/BRL) for 5 minutes, centrifuged, and<br>
re-plated in EGM2 in 10 cm tissue culture dishes without irradiated MEF cells. After 24 hours<br>
non-adherent cells were removed and adherent cells were fed fresh medium. The rhesus ES cell-<br>
derived endothelial cells (RESDECs) could be grown to confluence and serially passaged and<br>
expanded in the EBM2 medium.<br>
[00020] Human umbilical vein cells (HUVECs) (Clonetics/Biowhittaker) were also grown<br>
and passaged in EGM2 by known methods.<br>
[00021] Tube Formation on Matrigel<br>
[00022] 0.2ml of Matrigel (Becton Dickinson) was added to each well of a 24 well tissue<br>
culture plate and allowed to solidify at 37°C for at least 30 minutes. Following gelation, 0.2ml of<br>
a cell suspension containing 5 x 104 -1 x 105 RESDECs was placed on top of the Matrigel. The<br>
cultures were incubated at 37°C/5% CO2 and observed at 24,48, and 72 hours for rearrangement<br>
of cells into tube-like capillary structures. Individual experiments were performed in triplicate<br>
and representative wells recorded by photomicrography.<br>
{00023] VEGF and bFGF ELISA<br>
[00024] RESDECs were cultured for 3 days in the absence of VEGF or bFGF in EGM2,<br>
EGM2 supplemented with 10% Knockout serum replacer (GIBCO) instead of FBS, or DMEM<br>
supplemented with 10% FBS. After 72 hours the conditioned media (CM) was collected and<br>
centrifuged to remove dead cells. EGM2 medium alone served as a negative control. The<br>
amount of VEGF or bFGF in the CM was analyzed by colorimetric ELISA assay (R &amp; D<br>
systems, Minneapolis, MN).<br>
[00025] Flow Cytometry<br>
[00026] RESDECs were washed with Ca2+ and Mg2+ free PBS and detached from the<br>
monolayer with 0.05% trypsin/0.53mM EDTA for 5 minutes. The dissociated cells were<br>
centrifuged and washed with FACS medium consisting of PBS supplemented with 2% FBS and<br>
0.1% sodium azide. After filtration through 80-micron nitex, the single-cell suspension was<br>
measured in aliquots and stained with either isotype control or antigen-specific antibodies diluted<br>
to appropriate concentrations in FACs media. Cell surface antigen expression was analyzed<br>
using antigen-specific primary antibody followed by fluorescent-tagged secondary antibodies<br>
(indirect staining), or fluorescently-conjugated antigen-specific antibodies (Direct staining).<br>
Appropriate unconjugated mouse and goat IgGs (both Sigma) as well as FITC-conjugated mouse<br>
IgG (Pharmingen San Diego, CA)) were used as isotype controls. Unconjugated antigen-specific<br>
antibody against flk-1 (Research Diagnostics) was detected with a FITC labeled anti-goat IgG<br>
antibody (Sigma). Unconjugated antibodies against VEGF receptor 1 (Flt-1) and VEGF receptor<br>
2 (flk-1) (both Sigma) were detected with a FITC labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (Caltag).<br>
Unconjugated P1H12 antibody (mouse IgGl, provided by Dr. Robert Hebbel, University of<br>
Minnesota) was detected with rat anti-mouse IgG-FITC conjugated secondary antibody (Caltag).<br>
The cells were also tested for expression of the VEGF receptor using a biotinylated VEGF Kit<br>
(R&amp;D Systems) and for their ability to bind the ulex europaeus agglutinin 1 (UEA-1) (Vector<br>
labs). Direct conjugated antibodies used were HLA-A, B, C-FITC (Phanningen) and aVp3/cl<br>
LM609-FITC (Chemicon). Human umbilical vein cells (HUVEC) (Clonetics) served as a<br>
positive control. Cells were analyzed without fixation on a FACScan or FACs Calibur (Becton<br>
Dickinson) using propidium iodide to exclude dead cells. Data analysis was carried out using<br>
CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson).<br>
[00027] Immunostaining<br>
[00028] Analysis for the acetylated LDL receptor was performed by diluting dilAcLDL<br>
(Molecular Probes) in serum-free EGM2. Cells were washed twice and incubated overnight in<br>
EGM2 medium containing dilAcLDL. After washing, the cells were observed by fluorescence<br>
microscopy (UV, rhodamine filter). HUVECs were used as a positive control.<br>
[00029] Expression of vonWillebrand factor protein (vWF) (DAKO) was detected with a<br>
goat anti-rabbit IgG-FITC secondary antibody (Sigma). Cells were fixed and incubated at room<br>
temperature for one hour with vWF, washed, and incubated for 30 minutes in the secondary<br>
antibody. After a final wash, cells were observed by fluorescence microscopy (UV, FITC filter).<br>
HUVECS again served as a positive control.<br>
[00030] Matrigel Plugs<br>
[00031] In one experiment SCID mice (Balb/Scid, Harlan Sprague Dawley) were injected<br>
subcutaneously with 0.5ml Matrigel (Becton Dickinson) containing 5 x 105 -1 x 106 RESDECs.<br>
A second experiment was performed implanting a sponge containing the RESDECs into the<br>
solidified Matrigel. The Matrigel plugs were removed after 14,21,35, and 42 days. Vessels<br>
were observed by injecting high molecular weight FITC-dextran (Sigma) intravenously a few<br>
minutes before removing and fixing the plugs. Standard H/E slides were also prepared.<br>
[00032] In Vivo Studies<br>
[00033] Adherent RESDECs were harvested by trypsinization and mixed with the mouse<br>
mammary carcinoma, C755 cell line. In two separate experiments Balb/c-SCID mice were<br>
injected subcutaneously with either 1 x 106 C755 tumor cells, or 1 x 106 RESDECs, or with a<br>
mixture of 1 x 106 tumor cells and 1 x 106 RESDECs. After initial growth, tumors were<br>
measured by caliper every 3-5 days. Approximately three weeks after transplantation all mice<br>
were sacrificed for histochemical analysis of the grown tumors. Mice injected with only<br>
RESDECs failed to grow tumors.<br>
[00034] Immunohistochemical Staining of Tumors<br>
[00035] In the first experiment tumors were isolated and fixed in 10% formalin for the<br>
preparation of paraffin sections. To prepare frozen sections tumors were fixed in 2%<br>
paraformaldehyde. All sections were mounted onto Fisher Superfrost slides. Using the standard<br>
ABC technique (VectaStain Elite ABC kit, Vector labs) sections were processed for expression<br>
of HLA -class IA 3, C (W6/32 antibody, IgG2a) and CD31 (IgG1) (Novacastra, Vector). Mouse<br>
IgGl (Sigma) and IgG2a (Southern Biotechnology) were used as isotype controls. The<br>
peroxidase activity was visualized with a DAB substrate (Vector) and sections were<br>
counterstained with hematoxylin.<br>
[00036] RESULTS<br>
[00037] Derivation of endothelial cells from rhesus monkey ES cells:<br>
[00038] Rhesus monkey ES cells were grown in EGM2 medium containing VEGF, bFGF,<br>
EGF, and IGF as described in materials and methods. After approximately 5-10 days, these ES<br>
cells assumed a uniform morphology similar to elongated or stellate -shaped endothelial cells.<br>
In contrast, ES cells grown in medium supplemented with FBS alone differentiated into a<br>
heterogeneous cell population with no distinct endothelial-appearing cells. The potential<br>
endothelial cells were serially passaged and expanded for approximately 20 population doublings<br>
while grown in EGM2 with maintenance of a homogeneous appearance. As an initial test of<br>
endothelial cell characteristics, these cells were placed in Matrigel-based medium where they<br>
rapidly formed tube-like capillary structures similar those formed by HUVEC or other<br>
endothelial cell populations when placed in Matrigel-based medium. Cytogenetic studies showed<br>
all cells have a normal rhesus monkey 40 XY karyotype. These cytogenetic results were<br>
important to demonstrate that these cells were not transformed after prolonged culture, nor were<br>
they derived from potentially contaminating mouse embryonic fibroblast cells that are used for<br>
the growth of undifferentiated ES cells.<br>
[00039] Electron micrographs of the rhesus ES cell-derived cells demonstrate typical<br>
endothelial cell features. These include multiple dense round or rod-shaped Weibel-Palade<br>
bodies, tight junctions between cells, and endocytic/exocytic vesicles.<br>
[00040] Immunophenotyping<br>
[00041] Next, immunohistochemical staining of these rhesus-derived endothelial-like cells<br>
demonstrated the presence von Willebrand factor (vWF), the ability for these cells to rapidly<br>
take-up acetylated LDL and the ability to bind the UEA-1 lectin. Flow cytometric studies<br>
confirmed high levels of UEA-1 binding, as well as expression of the integrin avj33 and the<br>
surface antigen CD146 recognized by the P1H12 antibody. These proteins have been shown to<br>
be important in endothelial cell-cell interactions. These results led us to call these rhesus<br>
embryonic stem cell-derived endothelial cells (RESDECs). Surprisingly, antibodies against the<br>
VEGF receptors flk-1 and flt-1 did not bind these RESDECs, though binding to HUVEC cells<br>
was also weak. However, an assay using biotinylated VEGF and secondary streptavidin-FITC<br>
showed binding to the RESDEC (and HUVEC) cells. Specificity of this.binding was<br>
demonstrated by blocking with an anti-VEGF antibody. This results suggests that either the anti-<br>
human flk-1 and flt-1 antibodies did not cross-react with the rhesus-derived cells, or these cells<br>
express a different VEGF receptor. RT-PCR studies showed expression of flk-1 mRNA in the<br>
RESDECs, suggesting that the antibodies may not cross-react. Of course, it is possible that<br>
protein derived from this mRNA is not properly expressed on the ceil surface.<br>
[00042] The RESDEC cells do differ from HUVEC cells by lack of expression of CD31<br>
and VE-cadherin, two surface antigens commonly, but not uniformly, found on the surface of<br>
endothelial cells. RT-PCR studies confirm absence of mRNA expression of these genes.<br>
However, some studies of mouse ES cell-derived endothelial cells also shows lack of CD31 and<br>
VE-cadherin in certain endothelial cell populations. While CD31 and VE-cadherin can serve as<br>
positive markers of endothelial cells, lack of expression does not preclude these being endothelial<br>
cells.<br>
[00043] Angiogenesis from RESDEC cells-<br>
[00044] In vivo function of the RESDECs was first assessed by a Matrigel plug assay.<br>
Here, RESDECs were imbedded in a sponge that was suspended into solidified Matrigel. This<br>
Matrigel plug is then implanted subcutaneously in a severe combined immunodeficient (SCID)<br>
mouse. After approximately 28 days, the mouse was injeceted intravenously with a FITC—<br>
dextran solution, followed by plug removal and imaging. This demonstrated intense vascular<br>
localization toward the RESDEC containing sponge, a chemotactic-like event typical of<br>
endothelial cells. From the appearance of this vascularization, it is likely that this represents an<br>
area of murine vessel angiogenesis in response to RESDEC-derived factors. Indeed, subsequent<br>
analysis.of RESDEC supernatant by ELISA demonstrated a significant level of vascular<br>
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) produced by these cells. However, basic fibroblast growth<br>
factor (bFGF), another angiogenic protein often produced by endothelial cells, was not measured<br>
in RESDEC culture supernatant.<br>
[00045] To demonstrate neo-vessels produced by the RESDECs.. 0.5 -1.0 x 106 cells were<br>
evenly suspended in a Matrigel plug implanted subcutaneously in a SCID mouse. Again, the<br>
animals were injected with FITC-dextran, followed by plug removal and imaging. Here, larger<br>
vascular structures were seen and subsequent histological examination of the plug showed<br>
vascular formation by the RESDECs.<br>
[00046] Next, to demonstrate the ability of RESDEC cells to contribute to active<br>
angiogenesis within tumors in vivo another SCBD mouse model was used. Here, cells of the<br>
mouse mammary carcinoma line C755 were injected subcutaneously either alone or co-injected<br>
with an equivalent number of RESDECs. Tumor growth was measured at regular intervals and<br>
tumors grew significantly faster when co-injected with RESDECs. Importantly, 106 RESDECs<br>
injected alone did not lead to any measurable tumor growth, demonstrating these cells are not<br>
directly tumorigenic. These tumors were highly vascular and immunohistochemical staining of<br>
the tumors with anti-human specific antibodies (that cross-react to rhesus monkey but not mouse<br>
cells) clearly demonstrate a contribution to the endothelium from the RESDEC cells. Staining of<br>
a substantial number of endothelial cells was positive using anti-MHC class I or anti-vWF<br>
antibodies in tumors co-injected with RESDEC cells, but endothelial cells in tumors derived from<br>
C755 alone were negative for these antigens.<br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
1. A method for directing the differentiation of primate embryonic stem cells into<br>
endothelial cells comprising the steps of<br>
(a) culturing a culture of embryonic stem cells in a medium containing vascular<br>
endothelial cell growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, insulin-like<br>
growth factor and epidermal growth factor; and<br>
(b) sub-culturing cells which have the morphology of endothelial cells.<br>
2. A method as claimed in claim 1 wherein the primate cells are rhesus monkey cells.<br>
3. A method as claimed in claim 1 wherein the primate cells are human cells.<br>
4. A method as claimed in claim 1 wherein the medium for the culture of embryonic<br>
stem cells into endothelial cells also includes mammalian serum.<br>
A method is described to induce primate embryonic stem cells to differentiate into<br>
a relatively homogenous population of endothelial cells. The ES derived endothelial cells<br>
have the general morphological and cell surface marker characteristics of endothelial<br>
cells. The ES derived endothelial cells also are capable of inducing and participating in<br>
blood vessel formation (or vascularization) when transplanted into tissue in vivo.</td>
