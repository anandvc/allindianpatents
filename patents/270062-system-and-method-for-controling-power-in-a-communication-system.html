				<td>SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR CONTROLLING POWER IN A<br>
COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention generally relates to a communication system, and in<br>
particular, to a system and method for controlling power of a Mobile Station (MS) in<br>
a communication system.<br>
2. Description of the Related Art<br>
Extensive research on next generation communication systems are being<br>
conducted to provide users with high-speed services having various Quality of<br>
Service (QoS) levels. Meanwhile, power control schemes used in current<br>
communication systems can nornally be classified as downlink (forward) power<br>
control schemes and uplink (reverse) power control schemes according to direction<br>
of power control, and can be classified as open-loop power control schemes and<br>
closed-loop power control schemes according to whether a transmitter, or a Base<br>
Station (BS), receives feedback information from a receiver, or an MS.<br>
In downlink power control schemes, power control is performed in a BS.<br>
When the channel condition is good as a distance between the BS and an MS is short,<br>
i.e. as the MS is located in a cente' area of the BS, or as there is no shadowing due to<br>
obstacles, the BS allows the MS to transmit signals with minimum possible<br>
transmission power, thereby reducing interference to neighboring BSs. When<br>
channel conditions are poor, the ES increases power of transmission signals as high<br>
as needed within a possible range so the MS may normally receive transmission<br>
signals from the BS. In uplink power control schemes, power control is performed<br>
in an MS. The MS serves as a transmitter and the BS serves as a receiver, and they<br>
control power in the same manner as that in downlink power control schemes.<br>
In open-loop power control schemes, a transmitter (BS or MS) performing<br>
power control, independently determines channel quality of a receiver (MS or BS),<br>
and performs power control depending on the channel quality, and open-loop power<br>
control scheme control power bas;d on reversibility between downlink and uplink<br>
channels. Reversibility between downlink and uplink channels, as used herein,<br>
means that MSs having the sane (or similar) location with respect to a BS will<br>
experience similar path attenuation due to similar path attenuation based on a<br>
distance from the BS, the similar antenna gain based on antenna patterns, similar<br>
shadowing effect by the topology, similar multi-path fading, etc. That is, in open-<br>
loop power control schemes, based on reversibility between downlink and uplink<br>
channels, a transmitter spontaneously estimates signal reception quality of a receiver,<br>
calculates necessary transmission power depending on the estimated signal reception<br>
quality, and then transmits signals with the calculated transmission power.<br>
In closed-loop power cortrol schemes, unlike in open-loop power control<br>
schemes, a transmitter controls necessary transmission power based on signal<br>
reception quality of a receiver from which it has received a feedback channel,<br>
without independently determining a channel quality. In such a closed-loop power<br>
control scheme, overhead for feedback channels occurs undesirably. However,<br>
because a transmitter can acquire information on the channel quality at the receiver, a<br>
closed-loop power control scherie can accurately control power of transmission<br>
signals, as compared to an open-loop power control scheme.<br>
However, in a typical communication system, as a number of MSs receiving<br>
communication services from a BS increases, a closed-loop power control scheme<br>
suffers from an increase in an amount of channel quality information that the BS<br>
should receive from MSs over a feedback channel. In addition, a closed-loop power<br>
control scheme suffers from an increase in overhead of a feedback channel allocated<br>
for receiving channel quality information. Further, in a typical communication<br>
system, when a BS transmits power control information of MSs to the MSs<br>
according to channel quality infoimation fed back from the MSs, an increase in a<br>
number of MSs increases an amount of power control information that the BS should<br>
transmit to the MSs, and the increase in the amount of power control information for<br>
the MSs causes an increase in oveihead in the communication system. Therefore, a<br>
need exists for a power control scheme for reducing overhead in communication<br>
systems.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Preferred embodiments of :he present invention will now be described in with<br>
reference to the drawings. In tie following description, a description of known<br>
functions and configurations incorporated herein has been omitted for clarity and<br>
conciseness.<br>
The present invention provides a system and method for controlling power in<br>
a communication system, for example, an Institute of Electrical and Electronics<br>
Engineers (IEEE) 802.16 communication system, which is a Broadband Wireless<br>
Access (BWA) communication system. Although the present invention will be<br>
described herein with reference to an IEEE 802.16 communication system<br>
employing Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)/Orthogonal<br>
Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA), by way of example, a power control<br>
system and method provided in the present invention can also be applied to other<br>
communication systems.<br>
In addition, the present invention provides a system and method for<br>
controlling power when a communication system exchanges data between a Base<br>
Station (BS) in charge of a particular cell and a Mobile Station (MS) that is located<br>
in the cell and receives a communication service from the BS. The present<br>
invention, described below, provides a power control system and method in which a<br>
BS in charge of a particular cell transmits, to an MS receiving a communication<br>
service therefrom, power control nformation for controlling power of the MS in a<br>
communication system employing OFDM/OFDMA.<br>
The present invention provides a communication system in which a BS in<br>
charge of a particular cell generates power control information of MSs according to<br>
channel information of MSs, fed back from MSs located in the BS cell, i.e. Channel<br>
Quality Information (CQI), for example, Signal-to-Interference and Noise Ratio<br>
(SINR) or Carrier-to-Interferem-e and Noise Ratio (CINR) that the MSs have<br>
calculated and transmitted to the BS; maps the generated power control information<br>
to corresponding MSs according to allocation information of Channel Quality<br>
Information Channels (CQICHs) allocated to the MSs to receive the CQI feedback;<br>
and then transmits a message w th power control information to the MSs. In other<br>
words, the BS broadcasts the message to the MSs, and upon receipt of the<br>
broadcasted message, each of the MSs detects power control information<br>
corresponding thereto, and then controls power of the associated MS according to the<br>
detected power control information.<br>
Further, in a communication system according to the present invention, for<br>
power control for a plurality of MSs in a particular cell, a BS generates power<br>
control information of the MSs according to CQIs of the MSs, generates a power<br>
control bit sequence Power_Control_Bit_Sequence according to the generated power<br>
control information, maps the pov/er control information to the MSs according to<br>
CQICH allocation information, i.e. maps the power control bit sequence to the MSs,<br>
and then broadcasts a message with the power control bit sequence to the MSs.<br>
Upon receipt of the message, each of the MSs detects its own power control<br>
information included in the message, and controls power associated with the MS<br>
depending on the detected power control information.<br>
As a result, in the communication system according to the present invention,<br>
even though a number of MSs are located in a particular cell, the BS in charge of the<br>
particular cell can minimize an increase in overhead by transmitting power control<br>
information over one burst field independently for individual frames of the MSs. In<br>
addition, the BS can control power of the MSs at high speed by transmitting power<br>
control information over one burst leld independently for individual frames of the<br>
MSs.<br>
A scheme in which a BS transmits power control information of the MSs,<br>
generated depending on CQIs of the MSs, in a message can be classified as a scheme<br>
of transmitting power control information in a Fast Power Control (FPC) message in<br>
a form of a Medium Access Control (MAC) message, a scheme of transmitting<br>
power control Information Elements (IEs) in Uplink MAP (UL-MAP) IEs of a UL-<br>
MAP message, and a scheme of transmitting Fast Tracking IEs in UL-MAP IEs of<br>
the UL-MAP message. These messages including power control information of the<br>
MSs are broadcasted to all MSs located in the cell.<br>
In addition, a scheme in which the BS transmits in the above-described<br>
messages a power control bit sequence of the power control information generated<br>
depending on CQIs received fron the MSs can be classified herein into a scheme of<br>
transmitting the power control bii sequence in a power control message in the form<br>
of a MAC message, a scheme of transmitting the power control bit sequence in a<br>
MAP message, for example, Downlink MAP (DL-MAP) message or UL-MAP<br>
message, and a scheme of transrr itting the power control bit sequence in DL-MAP<br>
IEs or UL-MAP IEs of a MAP message, for example, DL-MAP message or UL-MAP<br>
message. Similarly, these messages including therein the power control bit<br>
sequence are broadcasted to all MSs located in the cell.<br>
With reference to Table 1, a description will now made of an FPC message<br>
including the power control information. Table 1 shows a format of an FPC<br>
message including power control information.<br><br><br>
As shown in Table 1, the FPC message includes a 'Management Message<br>
Type' field indicating a type of a corresponding management message, a 'Number of<br>
stations' field indicating unique numbers of MSs, a 'Power management frame' field<br>
indicating a power managemem frame, a 'Basic CID' field indicating a basic<br>
Connection Identifier (CID) for each of MSs, and a Tower adjust' field indicating<br>
power adjustment for each of tht- MSs. To transmit power control information of<br>
the MSs through the FPC message, the BS includes basic CIDs of the MSs in the<br>
Basic CID field of the FPC message and transmits the FPC message to the MSs.<br>
An IEEE 802.16 communication system, a typical BWA communication<br>
system, has a frame structure, and a BS of the system efficiently allocates resources<br>
of each frame to MSs, and transmits the resource allocation information to the MSs<br>
through a MAP message. A MAP message used for transmitting the downlink<br>
resource allocation information is i DL-MAP message, and a MAP message used for<br>
transmitting uplink resource allocation information is a UL-MAP message.<br>
When the BS transmits the downlink resource allocation information and the<br>
uplink resource allocation information through the DL-MAP message and the UL-<br>
MAP message in this manner, the MSs can decode the DL-MAP message and the<br>
UL-MAP message, transmitted from the BS, and detect therefrom power control<br>
information, and control information for the allocation locations where resources are<br>
allocated to them, and for the data that they should receive. The MSs can receive<br>
or transmit data over the downlink or the uplink by detecting the resource allocation<br>
location and control information. In addition, when transmitting data, the MSs can<br>
control transmission power using the power control information.<br>
The MAP message is composed of different MAP IE formats according to<br>
whether it is for a downlink or an uplink, and according to a type of a data burst, i.e.<br>
according to whether the data burst is (i) a data burst to which Hybrid Automatic<br>
Repeat reQuest (HARQ) is applied (HARQ data burst), (ii) a data burst to which<br>
HARQ is not applied (Non-HARQ data burst), or (iii) control information.<br>
Therefore, the MSs should previously know a format of each MAP IE to decode the<br>
MAP IE, and each MAP IE can be distinguished using a Downlink Interval Usage<br>
Code (DIUC), for the downlink, and using an Uplink Interval Usage Code (UIUC),<br>
for the uplink.<br>
As described above, in the BWA communication system, data transmission is<br>
performed frame by frame, and oach frame is divided into a field for transmitting<br>
downlink data and a field for transmitting uplink data. The fields for transmitting<br>
data are formed in a 2-dimensional arrangement of 'frequency domain' x 'time<br>
domain', and each element in the 2-dimensional arrangement is a slot which is an<br>
allocation unit. That is, the frequency domain is divided in units of subchannels,<br>
each of which is a bundle of subcarriers, and the time domain is divided in units of<br>
symbols. Therefore, the slot indicates a field where a symbol is occupied by one<br>
subchannel. Each slot is allocated only to one arbitrary MS among the MSs located<br>
in one cell, and a set of slots allocated to each of MSs located in the cell is a burst.<br>
As described above, in the communication system, uplink wireless resources are<br>
allocated in such a manner that slots are shared by MSs. With reference to FIG. 1, a<br>
description will now be made cf a frame structure in a communication system<br>
according to the present invention<br>
FIG. 1 shows a frame structure in a communication system according to the<br>
present invention. Referring to IIG. 1, the frame is shown by subchannels in the<br>
frequency domain and symbol' in the time domain. The y-axis indicates<br>
subchannels which are resource inks of frequency, and the x-axis indicates OFDM<br>
symbols which are resource units of time. The frame includes a preamble field 102,<br>
a DL-MAP message field 104, a 1JL-MAP message field 106, a downlink burst (DL<br>
Burst) field 108, and an uplink burst (UL Burst) field 110.<br>
The preamble field 102 is used for transmitting a synchronization signal, or a<br>
preamble sequence, for acquisition of a transmission/reception period, i.e. acquisition<br>
of synchronization between a BS and MSs in a communication system. The DL-<br>
MAP message field 104 is used for transmitting a DL-MAP message, and the UL-<br>
MAP message field 106 is used for transmitting a UL-MAP message. The DL-MAP<br>
message field 104, although not shown, includes a plurality of IEs, and the IEs each<br>
include information on the corresponding downlink burst field. Similarly, the UL-<br>
MAP message field 106, although not shown, includes a plurality of IEs, and the IEs<br>
each include information on the corresponding uplink burst field and power control<br>
information of the MSs. The downlink burst field 108 is used for transmitting the<br>
corresponding downlink data burst, and the uplink burst field 110 is used for<br>
transmitting the corresponding uplink data burst. With reference to FIG. 2 and Table<br>
2, a description will now be made of a scheme of transmitting power control IEs in<br>
UL-MAP IEs of a UL-MAP message, among the above-described schemes of<br>
transmitting power control information in a message.<br>
FIG. 2 shows a structure of a UL-MAP message field of a frame in a<br>
communication system according to the present invention. Referring to FIG. 2, the<br>
UL-MAP message field 201 incudes a UL-MAP basic information field 203 for<br>
transmitting basic information of a UL-MAP message, and a per-burst UL-MAP IE<br>
field 205 for transmitting per-burst UL-MAP IEs. The per-burst UL-MAP IE field<br>
205 includes a CID/UIUC field 207 for transmitting CID and UIUC for per-burst<br>
allocation information and powtr control information of the MSs, an allocation<br>
information field 209 for transmi ting burst allocation information, and an extended<br>
UlUC-dependent IE field 211 for transmitting extended UlUC-dependent IEs, and<br>
the extended UlUC-dependent IE field 211 includes a power control IE field 213 for<br>
transmitting power control IEs having power control parameters separately defined<br>
for individual MSs, for transmitting power control information of the MSs.<br><br>
As shown in Table 2, UL-lvIAP IEs of the UL-MAP message include CID and<br>
UIUC for per-burst allocation information and power control information of the MSs,<br>
and extended UlUC-dependent II is, and the extended UlUC-dependent IEs include<br>
power control IEs having power control parameters separately defined for individual<br>
MSs according to power control information of the MSs. With reference to Table 3,<br>
a description will now be made of a scheme of transmitting Fast Tracking IEs in UL-<br>
MAP IEs of a UL-MAP message, among the above-described schemes of<br>
transmitting power control information in a message.<br>
Table 3 shows UL-MAP [Es of a UL-MAP message, which include Fast<br>
Tracking IEs.<br><br>
As shown in Table 3, UL-MAP IEs of the UL-MAP message, like in Table 2,<br>
include CID and UIUC for psr-burst allocation information and power control<br>
information of the MSs, and extended UlUC-dependent IEs. While the extended<br>
UlUC-dependent IEs of the UL-MAP IEs of the UL-MAP message, shown in Table<br>
2, include the power control IEs Slaving power control parameters separately defined<br>
for individual MSs depending on the power control information of the MSs, the<br>
extended UlUC-dependent IEs oi the UL-MAP IEs of the UL-MAP message, shown<br>
in Table 3, include Fast Tracking [Es of the UL-MAP message, which include power<br>
control information for all MSs ocated in the cell. The Fast Tracking IEs of the<br>
UL-MAP message are used as additional information in addition to the information<br>
for the MSs, previously delivered at a previous frame, and are equal to unicast<br>
allocation IEs in the UL-MAP message. In addition, the Fast Tracking IEs of the<br>
UL-MAP message can be transmitted over the power control IE field 213 of FIG 2,<br>
over which the power control IEs shown in Table 2 are transmitted.<br>
A description will now b; made of a scheme in which a BS transmits in a<br>
foregoing message a power control bit sequence of power control information<br>
generated according to CQIs of MSs in a communication system according to the<br>
present invention. A description will then be made of a process of transmitting the<br>
message including the power contiol bit sequence to the MSs, and controlling power<br>
of the MSs. With reference to F[G. 3, a description will first be made of a burst<br>
allocation information field and power control information field in the MAP message<br>
field of the foregoing frame. With reference to FIG. 4, a description will be made<br>
of the power control bit sequence of the power control information that the BS has<br>
generated depending on CQIs of ihe MSs. Thereafter, with reference to FIG. 5, a<br>
description will be made of CQICH allocation for transmission of CQIs of the MSs,<br>
and with reference to FIGS. 6 and 7, a description will be made of a method of<br>
mapping the generated power control information to the corresponding MSs<br>
according to the CQICH allocation information.<br>
FIG. 3 shows a burst allocation information field and a power control<br>
information field in a MAP message field of a frame in a communication system<br>
according to the present invention. Referring to FIG. 3, in the communication<br>
system, when N MSs are located in a cell, a burst field of the frame is divided into N<br>
sub-burst fields, and then allocated to the N MSs on a one-to-one basis. The<br>
allocation information of the di\ ided burst field is transmitted to the MSs over a<br>
MAP message field of the frame, which is divided into N burst allocation<br>
information fields 310-1,310-2, ••, 310-N. At this point, power control information<br>
of the MSs is transmitted to the MSs over one power control information field 320<br>
divided from the MAP message field. That is, in a communication system<br>
according to the present inventior, power control information of all MSs located in a<br>
particular cell is transmitted to the MSs, i.e. broadcasted to the MSs, over the one<br>
power control information field 3110 allocated in the MAP message field of the frame.<br>
Accordingly, in a communication system according to the present invention, even<br>
though a number of MSs located in a particular cell increases, the system can<br>
minimize an increase in overhead as a BS in charge of the cell transmits per-frame<br>
power control information of the MSs over the one power control information field<br>
320 allocated in the MAP message field of the frame. In addition, a<br>
communication system according to the present invention can rapidly control power<br>
of the MSs as the BS transmits per-frame power control information of the MSs over<br>
the one power control information field 320 allocated in the MAP message field of<br>
the frame.<br>
FIG. 4 shows a power control bit sequence for power control in a<br>
communication system according to the present invention. Referring to FIG. 4, in<br>
the communication system, a PS generates power control information of MSs<br>
according to CQIs received from N MSs located in the cell of the BS, and generates<br>
a power control bit sequence of the MSs, i.e. N power control bits 410-1, 410-2, •••,<br>
410-N for the MSs, according :o the generated power control information. The<br>
power control bits 410-1, 410-2, ••, 410-N of the MSs are each composed of m bits.<br>
More specifically, for m = I, indicating that the power control bits 410-1,410-<br>
2, •••, 410-N of the MSs are each composed of 1 bit, when the power control bits 410-<br>
1, 410-2, ••, 410-N of the MSs ar; set to '0', the MSs are ordered to keep the current<br>
power level, and when the power control bits 410-1,410-2, •••, 410-N of the MSs are<br>
set to '1', the MSs are ordered to increase or decrease the current power level by a<br>
threshold. For m = 2, indicating that the power control bits 410-1, 410-2, -, 410-N<br>
of the MSs are each composed of 2 bits, when the power control bits 410-1, 410-2, ••,<br>
410-N of the MSs are set to '00', the MSs are ordered to keep the current power<br>
level; when the power control bits 410-1, 410-2, •••, 410-N of the MSs are set to '01',<br>
the MSs are ordered to increase the current power level by a threshold; and when the<br>
power control bits 410-1,410-2, -,410-N of the MSs are set to '11', the MSs are<br>
ordered to decrease the current power level by a threshold. For m = n, indicating<br>
that the power control bits 410-1, 410-2, -., 410-N of the MSs are each composed of<br>
n bits, power of the MSs is changed in a type of a signed integer. For example, for n<br>
= 5, when the power control bits 410-1, 410-2, ¦••, 410-N of the MSs are set to<br>
'00100', the MSs are ordered to increase the current power level by 4 times a<br>
threshold, and when the power control bits. 410-1,410-2, •••,410-N of the MSs are<br>
set to '11100', the MSs are ordered to decrease the current power level by 4 times a<br>
threshold. Current power level, as used herein, refers to a transmission power level<br>
used when the MSs transmit their CQIs to the BS over CQICHs, and the 'threshold'<br>
refers to a value predetermined by the user or the system according to<br>
communication system and comm inication environment.<br>
FIG. 5 shows allocation of CQICHs over which a BS receives CQIs from MSs<br>
in a communication system according to the present invention. Referring to FIG. 5,<br>
the BS of the communication sysiem includes, in an (n-k)th frame 501, a preamble<br>
field 551, a DL-MAP message field 553, a UL-MAP message field 555, a downlink<br>
burst field 557, and an uplink burst field 559, as described in FIG. 1. The BS<br>
transmits to MSs a UL-MAP message which is transmitted over the UL-MAP<br>
message field 555 of the (n-k)th frame 501, and allocates it to a downlink burst field<br>
571 of an nth frame 503 to provide the MSs with information on a CQI field 573<br>
indicating CQIs to be transmitted by the MSs, and information on a CQICH field 577<br>
allocated such that the MSs may transmit CQIs over it according to information<br>
transmitted over the CQI field 573. That is, the BS broadcasts to the MSs the UL-<br>
MAP message transmitted over the UL-MAP message field 555 of the (n-k)th frame<br>
501, so the MSs can acquire information on the CQICH field 577 allocated to the<br>
MSs themselves in an uplink burst field 575 of the nth frame 503 and information on<br>
CQIs transmitted over the allocated CQICH field 577. With reference to FIGS. 6A<br>
and 7A, a detailed description will now be made of CQICH allocation to the MSs,<br>
and with reference to FIGS. 6B and 7B, a description will be made of mapping of<br>
power control information to the corresponding MSs according to the CQICH<br>
allocation of FIGS. 6A and 7A.<br>
FIGS. 6A and 6B show a method of mapping power control information to<br>
corresponding MSs according to CQICH allocation information of the MSs in a<br>
communication system according to the present invention. Referring to FIGS. 6A<br>
and 6B, in the communication system, when there are N MSs located in a cell, a<br>
CQICH field in an uplink burst field of a frame is divided into N sub-CQICH fields<br>
610-1, 610-2, 610-3, -, 610-(N-l), 610-N, and then allocated to the N MSs on a one-<br>
to-one basis. The allocation information of the divided CQICH field is broadcasted<br>
to the N MSs over a MAP message field, i.e. the UL-MAP message field, of the<br>
frame as described above. The sub-CQICH fields 610-1, 610-2, 610-3, -, 610-(N-<br>
1), 610-N are allocated to the MSs at ever/ frame so the MSs may transmit CQIs to<br>
the BS over them. As described above, based on the MAP message, the MSs each<br>
recognize CQICHs allocated to tiem by the BS, in other words, recognize indexes<br>
CQI #1, CQI #2, CQI #3, -, #CQI #(N-1) and CQI #N of CQICHs, for example,<br>
unique numbers and allocation orders of CQICHs allocated to them at every frame<br>
by the BS.<br>
For convenience, it will be assumed herein that the BS allocates a sub-CQICH<br>
field 610-1 with a CQICH index =-¦ CQI #1 to a first MS among the N MSs, allocates<br>
a sub-CQICH field 610-2 with a CQICH index = CQI #2 to a third MS, allocates a<br>
sub-CQICH field 610-3 with a CQICH index = CQI #3 to a second MS, allocates a<br>
sub-CQICH field 610-(N-l) with a CQICH index = CQI #(N-1) to an Nth MS, and<br>
allocates a sub-CQICH field 610-N with a CQICH index = CQI #N to an (N-l)th MS.<br>
Then the MSs, because they already know indexes of CQICHs allocated to them<br>
from the MAP message as described above, transmit their CQIs to the BS over sub-<br>
CQICH fields corresponding to the recognized CQICH indexes.<br>
Upon receipt of CQIs from the MSs over CQICHs, the BS generates power<br>
control information of the MSs and generates a power control bit sequence according<br>
to the generated power control information as described above, and then maps the<br>
generated power control information for the MSs to the corresponding MSs<br>
according to the CQICH allocation information of the MSs. That is, when all<br>
CQICH channels are allocated to all of N MSs, as shown in FIG. 6A, the BS maps<br>
the power control information for the MSs to the corresponding MSs in a message,<br>
for example, a MAP message field i.e. DL-MAP message field or UL-MAP message<br>
field, of a frame, according to the CQICH allocation information of the MSs, as<br>
shown in FIG. 6B.<br>
That is, as the BS generates power control information according to the CQIs<br>
after allocating CQICHs to all of N MS and receiving the CQIs over the allocated<br>
CQICHs as described above, one power control information field allocated for<br>
transmitting power control information for the MSs is divided into N sub-fields 660-<br>
1, 660-2, 660-3, •••, 660-(N-l) and 660-N, where N is the number of MSs, as<br>
described in FIG. 3, and then mapped to the N MSs, i.e. allocated to the N MSs on a<br>
one-to-one basis. The N sub-fields 660-1, 660-2, 660-3, -, 660-(N-l) and 660-N<br>
are mapped according to the CQICH allocation information of the MSs, for example,<br>
indexes of CQICHs allocated to tie MSs.<br>
Under the foregoing assumption given for convenience, a first sub-field 660-1<br>
among the N sub-fields 660-1, 660-2, 660-3, -, 660-(N-l) and 660-N is mapped, or<br>
allocated, to the first MS to which the sub-CQICH field 610-1 with a CQICH index<br>
= CQI #1 is allocated; a second sub-field 660-2 is mapped, or allocated, to the third<br>
MS to which the sub-CQICH field 610-2 with a CQICH index = CQI #2 is allocated;<br>
a third sub-field 660-3 is mapped, or allocated, to the second MS to which the sub-<br>
CQICH field 610-3 with a CQICH index == CQI #3 is allocated; an (N-l)th sub-field<br>
660-(N-l) is mapped, or allocated, to the Nth MS to which the sub-CQICH field 610-<br>
(N-l) with a CQICH index - CQI #(N-1) is allocated; and an Nth sub-field 660-N is<br>
mapped, or allocated, to the (N-l )th MS to which the sub-CQICH field 610-N with a<br>
CQICH index = CQI #N is allocated. The power control information is transmitted<br>
to the MSs, i.e. broadcasted to N MSs located in the cell, over the sub-fields 660-1,<br>
660-2, 660-3, •••, 660-(N-l) and (&gt;60-N, which are allocated to the MSs according to<br>
the CQICH allocation information of the MSs. Then, the MSs each recognize, from<br>
the CQICH allocation information included in the MAP message field, a sub-field<br>
over which power control information associated with each MS is transmitted, the<br>
sub-field being allocated in the one power control information field, detect power<br>
control information transmitted over the sub-field, and control power for the<br>
associated MS depending on the detected power control information.<br>
FIGS. 7A and 7B show a method of mapping power control information to<br>
corresponding MSs according to CQICH allocation information of MSs in a<br>
communication system according to the present invention. A description of FIGS.<br>
7A and 7B is given herein for a case where no CQICH is allocated to the third MS<br>
and the (N-l)th MS in FIGS. 6A ind 6B, and thus, the third MS and the (N-l)th MS<br>
do not transmit their CQIs to the BS.<br>
Referring to FIGS. 7 A and 7B, in a communication system, when there are<br>
N MSs located in a cell, a CQICH field in an uplink burst field of a frame is divided<br>
into N sub-CQICH fields 710-1 710-2, 710-3, -, 710-(N-l) and 710-N, and then<br>
allocated to the N MSs on a one-to-one basis. The allocation information of the<br>
divided CQICH field is broadcast to the N MSs over a MAP message field, i.e. UL-<br>
MAP message field, of the frame, as described above. In addition, the sub-CQICH<br>
fields 710-1, 710-2, 710-3, -, 71 )-(N-l) and 710-N are allocated to the MSs at every<br>
frame so that the MSs may transmit CQIs to the BS. As described above, based on<br>
the MAP message, the MSs each recognize CQICHs allocated to them by the BS, in<br>
other words, recognize indexes CQI #1, CQI #2, CQI #3, •••, #CQI #(N-1) and CQI<br>
#N of CQICHs, for example, uiique numbers and allocation orders of CQICHs<br>
allocated to them at every frame by the BS.<br>
Under the foregoing assumption that the BS allocates no CQICH to the third<br>
MS and the (N-l)th MS among the N MSs, because the BS allocates a sub-CQICH<br>
field 710-1 with a CQICH index - CQI #1 to a first MS among the N MSs and<br>
allocates no CQICH to the third MS, a sub-CQICH field 710-2 with a CQICH index<br>
= CQI #2 is not allocated, and because the BS allocates a sub-CQICH field 710-3<br>
with a CQICH index = CQI #3 to ;i second MS, allocates a sub-CQICH field 710-(N-<br>
1) with a CQICH index = CQI #(N-1) to an Nth MS, and allocates no CQICH to an<br>
(N-l)th MS, a sub-CQICH field 710-N with a CQICH index = CQI #N is not<br>
allocated. Then, the MSs, because they already know indexes of CQICHs allocated<br>
to them from the MAP message as described above, transmit their CQIs to the BS<br>
over sub-CQICH fields corresponding to the recognized CQICH indexes. That is,<br>
while the BS in FIG. 6A allocates CQICHs so all of N MSs may transmit their CQIs<br>
to the BS, i.e. allocates the N sub-fields 660-1, 660-2, 660-3, •••, 660-(N-l) and 660-<br>
N to all of N MSs, respectively, the BS in FIG. 7A allocates no CQICH to the third<br>
MS and the (N-l)th MS among the N MSs so they do not transmit their CQIs to the<br>
BS, and thus, the sub-CQICH fields 710-2 and 710-N with CQICH index = CQI #2<br>
and CQI #N are not allocated to the MSs.<br>
Upon receipt of CQIs over CQICHs from the MSs except for the third MS and<br>
the (N-l)th MS among the N MSs, the BS generates power control information of the<br>
MSs and generates a power control bit sequence according to the generated power<br>
control information as described above, and then maps the generated power control<br>
information of the MSs to the corresponding MSs according to the CQICH allocation<br>
information of the MSs. That is, when CQICH channels are allocated to the<br>
remaining MSs except for the third MS and the (N-l)th MS among the N MSs, as<br>
shown in FIG. 7 A, the BS maps the power control information for the MSs to the<br>
corresponding MSs in a message for example, a MAP message field, i.e. DL-MAP<br>
message field or UL-MAP message field, of a frame, according to the CQICH<br>
allocation information of the MSs, as shown in FIG. 7B.<br>
That is, as the BS generates power control information according to the CQIs<br>
after allocating CQICHs to the remaining MSs except for the third MS and the (N-<br>
l)th MS among the N MS and receiving the CQIs over the allocated CQICHs as<br>
described above, one power control information field allocated for transmitting<br>
power control information for ths MSs is divided into N sub-fields 760-1, 760-2,<br>
760-3, -, 760-(N-l) and 760-N, where N is the number of MSs, as described in FIG.<br>
3, and then mapped, i.e. allocated, to the remaining MSs except for the third MS and<br>
the (N-1 )th MS among the N MSs, respectively. The N sub-fields 760-1, 760-2, 760-<br>
3, ••¦, 760-(N-l) and 760-N ars mapped according to the CQICH allocation<br>
information of the MSs, for example, indexes of CQICHs allocated to the MSs.<br>
Under the foregoing assumption given for convenience, a first sub-field 760-1<br>
among the N sub-fields 760-1, 760-2, 760-3, -, 760-(N-l) and 760-N is mapped, or<br>
allocated, to the first MS to which the sub-CQICH field 710-1 with a CQICH index<br>
= CQI #1 is allocated; a second sub-field 760-2 is not mapped, or not allocated, to<br>
any MS as the sub-CQICH field 710-2 with a CQICH index = CQI #2 is not<br>
allocated; a third sub-field 760-3 is mapped, or allocated, to the second MS to which<br>
the sub-CQICH field 710-3 with a CQICH index - CQI #3 is allocated; an (N-l)th<br>
sub-field 760-(N-l) is mapped, or allocated, to the Nth MS to which the sub-CQICH<br>
field 710-(N-l) with a CQICH index = CQI #(N-1) is allocated; and an Nth sub-field<br>
760-N is not mapped, or not allocated, to any MS as the sub-CQICH field 710-N<br>
with a CQICH index = CQI #N is not allocated. The power control information is<br>
transmitted to the MSs, i.e. broadcasted to N MSs located in the cell, over the sub-<br>
fields 760-1, 760-3, •••, 760-(N-l), which are allocated to the MSs according to the<br>
CQICH allocation information of the MSs. Then, the MSs each recognize, from the<br>
CQICH allocation information included in the MAP message field, a sub-field over<br>
which its power control information is transmitted, the sub-field being allocated in<br>
the one power control informa ion field, detect power control information<br>
transmitted over the sub-field, and control power associated with each MS depending<br>
on the detected power control in formation. Of the second sub-field 760-2 and the<br>
Nth sub-field 760-N not allocated to the MSs, the Nth sub-field 760-N can be<br>
allocated for transmission of data other than transmission of power control<br>
information, thereby contributing to a reduction in length of a power control burst<br>
and to efficient use of resources. A description will now be made of a scheme in<br>
which a BS transmits in a messige the power control bit sequence of the power<br>
control information generated according to CQIs received from MSs in the<br>
communication system according to the present invention.<br>
Table 4 shows a format of a MAP message when the BS generates a power<br>
control bit sequence of power control information generated according to CQIs<br>
received from MSs and transmits the power control bit sequence in the MAP<br>
message, for example, DL-MA.P message or UL-MAP message, in the<br>
communication system according no the present invention.<br><br>
As shown in Table 4, the MAP message includes a<br>
Power_Control_Broadcasting field, and the PowerControlBroadcasting field<br>
includes a 'Length' field indicating a length of the PowerControlBroadcasting<br>
field, and a Power_Control_Bit_Sequence field indicating a power control bit<br>
sequence generated according to power control information of the MSs. The power<br>
control bit sequence has been dsscribed with reference to FIG. 4, and length<br>
information of the power control bit sequence is transmitted to the MSs over a<br>
Downlink Channel Descriptor (DCD) or an Uplink Channel Descriptor (UCD). The<br>
DCD and the UCD are messages periodically transmitted with defined physical<br>
channel characteristics of the down ink and the uplink, respectively, and these are not<br>
directly related to the present invention, so associated descriptions are omitted. The<br>
BS broadcasts in the MAP message to the MSs a power control bit sequence with<br>
power control information generated according to CQIs received over CQICHs from<br>
the MSs.<br>
Table 5 shows MAP IEs when the BS transmits in DL-MAP IEs or UL-MAP<br>
IEs of a MAP message, for example, DL-MAP message or UL-MAP message, a<br>
power control bit sequence of power control information generated according to<br>
CQIs received from the MSs in the communication system according to the present<br>
invention.<br><br>
As shown in Table 5, the DL-MAP IEs or UL-MAP IEs of the DL-MAP<br>
message or UL-MAP message include CID and UIUC or DIUC for per-burst<br>
allocation information and power control information of the MSs, and extended<br>
UlUC-dependent IEs or extended DIUC-dependent IEs. The extended UIUC-<br>
dependent IEs or extended DILC-dependent IEs include the power control bit<br>
sequence. With reference to Table 6, a description will now be made of a method in<br>
which the BS transmits, in a power control message in a type of a MAC message<br>
other than the MAP message, trie power control bit sequence of power control<br>
information generated according to CQIs received from the MSs in the<br>
communication system according to the present invention.<br>
Table 6 shows a format or" a power control message when a BS transmits in a<br>
power control message a power control bit sequence of power control information<br>
generated according to CQIs received from MSs in a communication system<br>
according to the present invention.<br><br>
As shown in Table 6, the power control message includes a 'Management<br>
Message Type' field indicating a type of the corresponding management message, a<br>
'Length' field indicting a length of the MAC message, and a<br>
Power_Control_Bit_Sequence fisld indicating a power control bit sequence<br>
generated according to power control information of the MSs. With reference to<br>
FIG. 8, a description will now be made of an operation in which a BS controls power<br>
of MSs in a communication systeri according to the present invention.<br>
FIG. 8 shows an operation in which a BS controls power of MSs in a<br>
communication system according to the present invention. Referring to FIG. 8, in<br>
step 801, the BS receives CQIs of MSs over CQICHs previously allocated to receive<br>
CQIs from the MSs located in he cell of the BS, and generates power control<br>
information of the MSs according to the received CQIs. Thereafter, in step 803, the<br>
BS generates a power control bit sequence according to the generated power control<br>
information as described with reference to FIG. 4. An operation of generating the<br>
power control bit sequence has been described in FIG. 4.<br>
Next, in step 805, the BS allocates CQICHs to the MSs so the MSs may<br>
transmit their CQI information as described above, and maps the power control<br>
information to the corresponding MSs according to the CQICH allocation<br>
information. That is, the BS divides one power control information field previously<br>
allocated for transmission of the power control information generated in step 801,<br>
according to the number of the MSs, and then allocates the divided power control<br>
information fields to the MSs according to the CQICH allocation information,<br>
thereby mapping the power control information to the corresponding MSs. An<br>
operation of mapping the powe- control information to the MSs according to the<br>
CQICH allocation information has been described with reference to FIGS. 6 and 7.<br>
In step 807, the BS includes the power control bit sequence generated in step<br>
803 in a message, and then transmits, or broadcasts, the message including the power<br>
control bit sequence to the MSs located in the cell. The message including the<br>
power control bit sequence of the generated power control information is a power<br>
control message in a type of a MAC message, or a MAP message, and is broadcast to<br>
the MSs. With reference to FIG 9, a description will now be made of an operation<br>
of controlling power by an MS in a communication system according to the present<br>
invention.<br>
FIG. 9 shows an operation of controlling power by an MS in a communication<br>
system according to the present invention. Referring to FIG. 9, in step 901, the MS<br>
transmits a CQI of the MS to a BS of the MS over a CQICH allocated by the BS, and<br>
upon receipt of a message from the BS, detects a power control bit sequence<br>
included in the message. Based on information included in the message received<br>
from the BS, the MS recognizes a field where the power control bit sequence is<br>
transmitted. An operation of generating, by the BS, power control information of<br>
the MS according to the CQI aid transmitting the message including the power<br>
control information has been previously described. In addition, an operation of<br>
recognizing, by the MS, the field where the power control bit sequence is transmitted,<br>
based on the information included in the message received from the BS, is equal to<br>
the operation of recognizing one power control information field based on the MAP<br>
message, so a description thereof will be omitted.<br>
Thereafter, in step 903, the MS detects power control information<br>
corresponding thereto from the power control information transmitted over the<br>
power control information field according to the CQICH allocation information<br>
included in the message. That is, because the BS maps the power control<br>
information to the corresponding MSs according to the CQICH allocation<br>
information before transmission as described above, the MS detects power control<br>
information of the MS according to the mapping. An operation of detecting the<br>
power control information by the VIS has been described above. Next, in step 905,<br>
the MS controls transmission power of the MS, i.e. power of a transmission signal to<br>
the BS, according to the power control information detected in step 903.<br>
FIGS. 10A and 10B show a power controller of a BS in a communication<br>
system according to the present invention. The power controller shown in FIG. 10A<br>
is for a case where a BS transmirs a power control bit sequence in a MAP message,<br>
and the power controller shown in FIG. 10B is for a case where a BS transmits a<br>
power control bit sequence in a MAC message, i.e. power control message.<br>
Referring to FIG. 10A, the power controller of the BS includes a CQICH<br>
allocator 1001 for allocating CQICHs to receive CQIs from MSs located in the cell<br>
of the BS, a power control inform ition generator 1003 for receiving CQIs of the MSs<br>
over the CQICHs allocated by tie CQICH allocator 1001 and generating power<br>
control information of the MSs according to the received CQIs, a power control bit<br>
sequence generator 1005 for generating a power control bit sequence according to<br>
the power control information generated by the power control information generator<br>
1003 as described with reference to FIG. 4, and a MAP message generator 1007 for<br>
generating a MAP message including the CQICH allocation information of MSs,<br>
allocated by the CQICH allocator 1001, and the power control bit sequence<br>
generated by the power control bi sequence generator 1005, and then broadcasting<br>
the generated MAP message to the MSs. The power control bit sequence generator<br>
1005 maps the power control i iformation of the MSs, received from the power<br>
control information generator 10(3, to the corresponding MSs according to the<br>
CQICH allocation information of the MSs, allocated by the CQICH allocator 1001,<br>
and then transmits the generated power control bit sequence to the MAP message<br>
generator 1007. This power conirol operation of the BS has been described above.<br>
Referring to FIG. 10B, the power controller of the BS of FIG 10B is similar<br>
to the power controller of the BS of FIG. 10A, except that the power controller of<br>
FIG. 10A includes a MAP message generator 1007 for transmitting the power control<br>
bit sequence in a MAP message, whereas the power controller of FIG. 10B includes a<br>
MAC message generator 1057 for transmitting a power control bit sequence in a<br>
MAC message.<br>
More specifically, the power controller of the BS of FIG. 10B includes a<br>
CQICH allocator 1051 for allocating CQICHs to receive CQIs from MSs located in<br>
the cell of the BS, a power control information generator 1053 for receiving CQIs of<br>
the MSs over the CQICHs allocated by the CQICH allocator 1051 and generating<br>
power control information of the MSs according to the received CQIs, a power<br>
control bit sequence generator 1055 for generating a power control bit sequence<br>
according to the power control information generated by the power control<br>
information generator 1053 as described with reference to FIG. 4, and a MAC<br>
message generator 1057 for generating a MAC message including the CQICH<br>
allocation information of the MSs, allocated by the CQICH allocator 1051, and the<br>
power control bit sequence generated by the power control bit sequence generator<br>
1055, and then broadcasting ths generated MAC message to the MSs. The power<br>
control bit sequence generator 1055 maps the power control information of the MSs,<br>
received from the power control information generator 1053, to the corresponding<br>
MSs according to the CQICH allocation information of the MSs, allocated by the<br>
CQICH allocator 1051, and then transmits the generated power control bit sequence<br>
to the MAC message generator 057. This power control operation of the BS has<br>
been described above.<br>
FIG. 11 shows a power controller of an MS in a communication system<br>
according to the present invention. Referring to FIG. 11, the power controller of the<br>
MS includes a CQICH allocation decider 1101 for, upon receipt of a message from a<br>
BS, determining whether a CQICH of the MS is allocated depending on CQICH<br>
allocation information included in the message, and detecting CQICH allocation<br>
information from the message v, hen it is determined that the CQICH of the MS is<br>
allocated, a power control bit sequence detector 1103 for detecting a power control<br>
bit sequence included in the message, a power control information detector 1105 for<br>
detecting power control informal ion corresponding to the MS itself from the power<br>
control bit sequence detected by the power control bit sequence detector 1103<br>
according to the CQICH allocation information detected by the CQICH allocation<br>
decider 1101, and a power controller 1107 for controlling transmission power to the<br>
BS according to the power control information detected by the power control<br>
information detector 1105. The power control bit sequence detector 1103<br>
recognizes a field where the power control bit sequence is transmitted, depending on<br>
the information included in the message received from the BS, and because the BS<br>
maps the power control information to the corresponding MSs according to the<br>
CQICH allocation information before transmission, the power control information<br>
detector 1105 detects power control information according to the mapping. This<br>
power control operation of the MS has been described before.<br>
As is apparent from tht foregoing description, according to the present<br>
invention, a BS generates power control information according to channel<br>
information received from MSs located in a cell of the BS, and broadcasts, to the<br>
MSs, generated power control information of the MSs according to allocation<br>
information of channels allocate i to receive the channel information. As a result,<br>
even though a number of MSs located in the cell increases, the BS can transmit per-<br>
frame power control information af the MSs over one burst field, thereby minimizing<br>
an increase in the overhead and facilitating fast power control of the MSs.<br>
While the invention has been shown and described with reference to certain<br>
