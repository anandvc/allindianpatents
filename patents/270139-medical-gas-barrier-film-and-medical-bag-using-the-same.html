MEDICAL GAS BARRIER FILM AND MEDICAL BAG USING THE SAME<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a gas barrier film<br>
suitable for medical applications and capable of<br>
maintaining excellent gas and vapor barrier properties and<br>
restricting elution of compounding ingredients of the film<br>
and ingredients of an adhesive without impairing<br>
flexibility, transparency and impact resistance of the<br>
film even after heating and sterilizing treatment and long<br>
storage, and a medical bag using the gas barrier film.<br>
Background Art<br>
Plastic bags such as infusion solution bags have<br>
advantages of easy handling and simple disposal after use.<br>
Currently, polyethylene as a safe material is generally<br>
used for plastic bags prevailing in the field of medical<br>
containers.<br>
However, since polyethylene is a plastic having high<br>
gas permeability, when easily oxidized medicine such as<br>
amino acid is contained in a medical bag, the medical bag<br>
is generally held in a plastic outer bag having gas barrier<br>
property together with an oxygen absorber.<br>
On the other hand, to reduce costs of the outer bag,<br>
there has been a demand to impart gas barrier property to<br>
the medical bag itself and various plastic materials<br>
having gas barrier property as well as properties<br>
including flexibility, transparency and impact resistance<br>
have been considered.<br>
A plastic material described in Patent document 1<br>
is characterized in that it is a multilayer film having<br>
a heat sealing resin layer, a biaxial oriented polyester<br>
resin film with an inorganic oxide deposited layer, a<br>
biaxial oriented polyamide resin film and a surface<br>
protective film, wherein the deposited layer of the<br>
biaxial oriented polyester resin film is adhered to the<br>
heat sealing resin layer, the surface on the opposite side<br>
to the deposited surface of the biaxial oriented polyester<br>
resin film is adhered to one surface of the biaxial<br>
oriented polyamide resin film, and the surface protective<br>
film is disposed on the other surface of the biaxial<br>
oriented polyamide resin film.<br>
A plastic material described in Patent document 2<br>
is characterized in that it is a multilayer film having<br>
a polyethylene layer forming a heat sealing part, a cyclic<br>
olefin polymer layer and a polyethylene terephthalate<br>
layer with an inorganic oxide deposited layer, wherein the<br>
polyethylene layer is adhered to one surface of the cyclic<br>
olefin polymer layer and the deposited layer of the<br>
polyethylene terephthalate layer is adhered to the other<br>
surface of the cyclic olefin polymer layer.<br>
A plastic material described in Patent document 3<br>
is characterized in that it is a multilayer film having<br>
a heat sealing layer (ethylene polymer), a biaxial<br>
oriented film (biaxial oriented polyethylene) substrate<br>
with an inorganic oxide deposited layer and a protective<br>
film (biaxial oriented polyamide film), wherein the heat<br>
sealing layer is adhered to the surface on the opposite<br>
side to the inorganic oxide deposited layer of the biaxial<br>
oriented film substrate, and the protective film is<br>
adhered to the surface of the inorganic oxide deposited<br>
layer of the biaxial oriented film substrate.<br>

[Patent document 2] Japanese Unexamined Patent<br>

[Patent document 3] Japanese Unexamined Patent<br>
Publication No. 2004-148681<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Problems to be Solved by the Invention<br>
Medical bags require, for example, heat resistance<br>
to heating and sterilizing treatment and safety to drugs<br>
contained therein (especially, low elution behavior of<br>
compounding ingredients of a resin film and ingredients<br>
of an adhesive) in addition to properties such as<br>
flexibility, transparency and impact resistance, which<br>
are required for conventional plastic bags. However, in<br>
the present circumstances, a plastic material which<br>
fulfills all of the properties has not been found.<br>
The multilayer films disclosed in Patent documents<br>
1 to 3 have a common problem that flexibility is low and<br>
thus creases and lines are easy to generate when an<br>
infusion solution bag or the like is formed of the films.<br>
Further, the multilayer films described in Patent<br>
documents 1 and 2 have the problem that gas and vapor<br>
barrier properties are easy to lower over time since the<br>
deposited layer of the polyester (polyethylene<br>
terephtalate) film substrate is disposed at the side of<br>
an inner surface of a packaging body using the multilayer<br>
films. The multilayer films described in Patent<br>
documents 1 and 3 have the problem that the adhesive used<br>
for adhesion between the layers is eluted. In the<br>
multilayer films described in Patent documents 2 and 3,<br>
since the thickness between an outer surface of a packaging<br>
body using the multilayer films and the deposited layer<br>
is small, gas and vapor properties can lower over time.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
gas barrier film suitable for medical applications capable<br>
of realizing excellent gas and vapor barrier properties<br>
while maintaining flexibility, transparency and impact<br>
resistance of the film and controlling elution of<br>
compounding ingredients of the film and ingredients of an<br>
adhesive even after heating and sterilizing treatment and<br>
long storage, and a medical bag using the gas barrier film.<br>

deposition oriented polyester layer having an inorganic<br>
oxide deposited layer on one surface thereof, an oriented<br>
polyamide layer adhered to the surface of the deposited<br>
layer and a polyethylene layer adhered to the surface on<br>
the opposite side to the adhered surface of the oriented<br>
polyamide layer to the deposited layer, and<br>

nylon-6, nylon-6,6, nylon-6,10, nylon-6,12, nylon-11 and<br>
nylon-12.<br>
Orienting treatment of the polyamide film may be<br>
either uniaxial orientation or biaxial orientation.<br>
Specific techniques of biaxial orienting treatment<br>
include tubular biaxial orientation and tenter biaxial<br>
orientation, for example. By applying orienting<br>
treatment to the polyamide film, pinhole resistance,<br>
strength, heat resistance in evaporating treatment,<br>

multilayer gas barrier film in thickness is preferably 15<br>
to 35 %, more preferably 20 to 30 %, and the ratio of the<br>
oriented polyamide layer to the entire medical gas barrier<br>
film in thickness is preferably 3 to 10 %, more preferably<br>
5 to 10 %. The thickness of the oriented polyamide layer<br>
is preferably 7 to 20 um, more preferably 10 to 15 um.<br>
The polyethylene layer in the multilayer gas barrier<br>
film is an outermost layer of a medical bag in the case<br>
where the medical bag is formed using the medical gas<br>
barrier film of the present invention, and for example,<br>
a layer formed to protect the surface of the medical gas<br>
barrier film and add soft touch to the medical gas barrier<br>
film.<br>
The polyethylene film forming the polyethylene layer<br>
is not limited by density range such as high density and<br>
low density, molecular structure such as straight chain,<br>
and manufacturing methods such as high-pressure process<br>
and low-pressure process, and various polyethylene films<br>
may be used.<br>
The polyethylene film may be formed of one type of<br>
polyethylene or a composite of two or more types of<br>
polyethylene.<br>
Further, the polyethylene film may be a multilayer<br>
film formed of two or more types of polyethylene . Specific<br>
examples of the multilayer film include a three-layer film<br>
in which high density polyethylene having a density of<br>
0.950 to 0.970 g/cm3 is disposed on both surfaces of a<br>
linear polyethylene film having a density of 0.910 to 0.930<br>
g/cm3.<br>
When the above-mentioned three-layer film is used<br>
as the polyethylene film forming the polyethylene layer,<br>

The multilayer gas barrier film can be manufactured<br>
by separately molding three types of films of the alumina<br>
deposition oriented polyester layer, the oriented<br>
polyamide layer and the polyethylene layer and then<br>
laminating the films according to various laminating<br>
methods.<br>
Various laminating methods can be adopted and a dry<br>
laminating method wherein an adhesive is used is the most<br>
preferable among them.<br>
Although the thickness of the entire multilayer gas<br>
barrier film is not specifically limited, the thickness<br>
of 30 to 80 um is preferable.<br>
Various adhesives used for manufacture of the<br>
laminated film can be adopted as an adhesive used in the<br>
dry laminating method. The adhesives include "TAKELAC"<br>

eluted from the multilayer gas barrier film is, the better<br>
the adhesive is. Such adhesives include adhesives for dry<br>
lamination comprising at least a base compound and a<br>
stiffener, and the following combinations of the base<br>
compound and the stiffener are included (Refer to Japanese<br>

crotonic acid, isocrotonic acid, nagic acid, acrylic acid<br>
and methacryl acid or anhydrides of these acids.<br>
As described above, the multilayer substrate film<br>
is provided on the other surface (the surface on the<br>
opposite side of the surface on which the deposited layer<br>
is formed) of the deposition oriented polyester layer in<br>
the multilayer gas barrier film, and is a laminated body<br>
having the cyclic olefin polymer layer, the elastomer<br>
layer and the heat sealing layer.<br>
The cyclic olefin polymer layer is provided to<br>
prevent ingredients of the adhesive from exuding from the<br>
multilayer gas barrier film and permeation of moisture<br>
from exerting a negative impact such as peeling on the<br>
deposited layer of the deposition oriented polyester film,<br>
for example.<br>
Cyclic olefin polymers forming the cyclic olefin<br>
polymer layer include, for example, a copolymer of<br>
ethylene and dicyclopentadiene compound, a copolymer of<br>
ethylene and norbornene compound, a ring-opened polymer<br>
of cyclopentadiene compound, a ring-opened copolymer of<br>
two or more types of cyclopentadiene compound and their<br>
hydrogenated polymers and copolymers.<br>
In particular, the hydrogenated polymers and<br>
copolymers as saturated polymers among the<br>
above-mentioned cyclic olefin polymers are suitable for<br>
the material for the cyclic olefin polymer layer of the<br>
present invention since they are especially excellent in<br>
vapor barrier property and gas barrier property and also<br>
excellent in the effect of preventing<br>
absorption/adsorption of medicine, heat resistance,<br>
transparency, stability and the like.<br>
The hydrogenated copclymer of ethylene and<br>
norbornene compound and the hydrogenated ring-opened<br>
polymer (copolymer) of one or two or more types of<br>
cyclopentadiene derivative are especially preferable<br>
among the above-mentioned cyclic olefin polymers.<br>
Specific examples of the cyclic olefin polymers<br>
include a polymer having repeating unit shown in the<br>
following general formula (1) and repeating unit shown in<br>
the following general formula (!') and a polymer having<br>
repeating unit shown in the following general formula (2) .<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
 (In the formulas, R1, R:', R2, R2', R3 and R4<br>
independently indicate hydrogen atom, hydrocarbon residue,<br>
halogen atom, ester, and a polar group such as nitryl and<br>
pylidyl. R1 and R2, R1 and R2' and R" and R4 may be connected<br>
to each other to form a ring, m, m' x and z indicate an<br>
integer of 1 or more, and n, n' and y indicates an integer<br>
of 1 or more).<br>
The polymer having the repeating units shown in the<br>
general formulas (1) and (1') is obtained by polymerizing<br>
one or two or more types of norbornene monomers according<br>
to a publicly known ring-opened polymerizing method or<br>
hydrogenating the ring-opened polymer thus obtained<br>
according to an ordinary method. On the other hand, the<br>
polymer having a structural unit shown in the general<br>
formula (2) is obtained by additive-copolymerizing one or<br>
two or more types of norbornene monomers and ethylene<br>
according to a publicly known method or hydrogenating the<br>
copolymer thus obtained according to an ordinary method.<br>
Although the type of cyclic olefin polymer is not<br>
specifically limited, the glass transition temperature<br>
(Tg) thereof is preferably 70°C or higher, more preferably<br>
80 to 150'C. Although the molecular weight of cyclic<br>
olefin polymer is not specifically limited, the number<br>

remaining in the molecular chain of cyclic olefin polymer<br>
is saturated by hydrogenation, although the hydrogenation<br>
ratio is not specifically limited, it is preferably 90 %<br>
or more, more preferably 95 % or more, even more preferably<br>
99 % or more.<br>
Specific examples of the cyclic olefin polymers<br>
include cyclic olefin polymer manufactured by Mitsui<br>
Chemicals, Inc. (product name "APEL (registered<br>
trademark)" series), optical resin manufactured by JSR<br>
Corporation ("ARTON (registered trademark)"),<br>

manufactured by Zeon Corp., (product name "ZEONOR<br>
(registered trademark)" series) and "TOPAS (product<br>
name)" manufactured by Ticona GmbH.<br>
In terms of compatibility with a layer adjacent to<br>
the cyclic olefin polymer layer (for example, an elastomer<br>
layer described later) , mixed resin of cyclic olefin<br>
polymer and polyolefin resin may be used for the cyclic<br>
olefin polymer layer. The polyolefin resins include, for<br>
example, polyethylene (PE) homopolymer, copolymer of<br>
ethylene and a-olefins having a carbon number 3 to 12 (for<br>
example, butane-1, pentene-1, hexene-1,<br>
4-methyl-l-pentene, cctene-1, decene-1), polypropylene<br>
(PP) homopolymer, and copolymer of propylene and a-olefins<br>
having a carbon number 2 to 12 (for example, ethylene,<br>
butane-1, pentene-1, hexene-1, 4-methyl-l-pentene,<br>
octene-1, decene-1). Above all, PE homopolymer is<br>
preferable . An example of a preferred mode of mixed resin<br>
of cyclic olefin polymer and polyolefin resin is that<br>
polyethylene having a density of 0.910 to 0.930 g/cm3 is<br>
mixed to cyclic olefin polymer by 5 to 40 weight %.<br>
The ratio of the cyclic olefin polymer layer to the<br>
multilayer substrate film in thickness is preferably 3 to<br>
10 % and the ratio of the cyclic olefin polymer to the entire<br>
medical gas barrier film in thickness is 5 to 10 %. The<br>
thickness of the cyclic olefin polymer layer is preferably<br>
10 to 20 μm.<br>
To protect hard and fragile cyclic olefin polymer,<br>
the elastomer layer is provided on the surface on each of<br>
both sides of the cyclic olefin polymer layer.<br>
Elastomers for the elastomer layer include<br>
polyolefin elastomers, styrene elastomers and urethane<br>
elastomers, for example.<br>
Polyolefin elastomers include linear polyethylene<br>
elastomer, ethylene-a-olefin copolymer elastomer and<br>
propylene-a-olefin copolymer elastomer, for example.<br>
The a-olefins include a-olefins having a carbon number of<br>
3 to 6 such as propylene, 1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene<br>
and 4-methyl-l-pentene, and 1-butene is preferable.<br>
Stylene elastomers include, for example,<br>
stylene-ethylene/butylene-stylene block copolymer<br>
(SEES), stylene-butadiene-stylene block copolymer (SBS),<br>
stylene-isoprene-stylene block copolymer (SIS) , modified<br>
SEES modified by maleic acid or the like,<br>
stylene-ethylene/propylene-stylene block copolymer<br>
(SEPS), stylene-ethylene/butylene block copolymer (SEE)<br>
and stylene-ethylene/propylene block copolymer (SEP) rethane elastomers include commercial products<br>
such as thermoplastic polyurethane manufactured by<br>
Dainichiseika Color &amp; Chemicals Mfg. Co., Ltd. (product<br>
name "RESAMINE P") and thermoplastic polyurethane<br>
manufactured by KYOWA HAKKO CHEMICAL Co., Ltd. (product<br>
name "ESTEN").<br>
In terms of adhesiveness to the other layers (for<br>
example, cyclic olefin polymer layer) in the multilayer<br>
substrate film and safety as the medical gas barrier film,<br>
among the above-mentioned elastomers, polyolefin<br>
elastomers are used preferably, and ethylene-a-olefin<br>
copolymer elastomers are used more preferably.<br>
From the similar viewpoint, a mixture of the<br>
above-mentioned elastomer, linear polyethylene having a<br>
density of 0.910 to 0.930 cm3 and high-density polyethylene<br>
having a density of 0.950 to 0.970 cm3, in which the linear<br>
polyethylene and the high-density polyethylene are mixed<br>
in the entire elastomer layer by 20 to 30 weight % and 3<br>
to 10 weight %, respectively, may be used for the elastomer<br>
layer.<br>
The ratio of the elastomer layer (when two or more<br>
elastomer layers are provided, the sum of each elastomer<br>
layer) to the multilayer substrate film in thickness is<br>
preferably 55 to 80 % and the sum of each elastomer layer<br>
to the multilayer substrate film in thickness to the entire<br>
medical gas barrier film is 43 to 62 %. The thickness of<br>
the elastomer layer is preferably 80 to 125 μm.<br>
The heat sealing layer constitutes an innermost<br>
layer when the medical bag is formed using the medical gas<br>
barrier film of the present invention.<br>
Materials for the heat sealing layer include<br>
polyolefin, for example. Above all, polyethylene is<br>
preferable and linear polyethylene having a density of<br>
0.925 to 0.945 cm3 is more preferable.<br>
When a medical bag having a plurality of storage<br>
chambers (so-called multi-chamber bag) is formed using the<br>
medical gas barrier film of the present invention, it is<br>
required that peelable seal is formed at each of partitions<br>
separating the storage chambers from each other. In this<br>
case, to facilitate formation of peelable seal,' a resin<br>
such as polypropylene that has a different melting point<br>
from the polyethylene and is incompatible with the<br>
polyethylene should be mixed to the polyethylene by 10 to<br>
40 weight %.<br>
The ratio of the heat sealing layer to the multilayer<br>
substrate film in thickness is preferably 10 to 25 % and<br>
the ratio of the heat sealing layer to the entire medical<br>
gas barrier film in thickness is preferably 8 to 19%. The<br>
thickness of the heat sealing layer is preferably 15 to<br>
30 μm.<br>
To improve formability, it is preferred that the<br>
polyethylene layer is disposed as an outermost layer in<br>
the multilayer substrate film.<br>
Polyethylene forming the polyethylene layer in the<br>
muitnayer substrate film is not specifically limited.<br>
For example, linear polyethylene having a density of 0.930<br>
to 0.950 cmj or the above-mentioned linear polyethylene<br>
to which high-density polyethylene having a density of<br>
0.950 to 0.970 cm3 is added by 15 to 40 weight % may be<br>
used.<br>
The ratio of the polyethylene layer to the multilayer<br>
substrate film in thickness is preferably 20 to 30 % and<br>
the ratio of the polyethylene layer to the entire medical<br>
gas barrier film in thickness is 14 to 24 %. The thickness<br>
of the polyethylene layer is preferably 30 to 50 μm.<br>
The specific example of the multilayer substrate<br>
film is not limited to this, but for example, a five-layer<br>
laminated body in which a pair of the elastomer layers are<br>
disposed on both surfaces of the cyclic olefin polymer<br>
layer, the heat sealing layer is disposed on the surface<br>
on the opposite side to the adhered surface of one<br>
elastomer layer to the cyclic olefin polymer layer and the<br>
polyethylene layer is disposed on the surface on the<br>
opposite side to the adhered surface of the other elastomer<br>
layer to the cyclic olefin polymer layer may be used.<br>
Alternatively/ a four-layer laminated body having no<br>
polyethylene layer may be also used.<br>
The multilayer substrate film may be manufactured<br>
by molding resin and elastomer materials forming the<br>
laminated body, according to various coextruding methods .<br>
The multilayer substrate f i lm may be formed as a<br>
cylindrical inflation film according to an inflation<br>
method. In this case, the heat sealing layer needs to be<br>
molded so as to be disposed on the inner side of the<br>
inflation film.<br>
The medical gas barrier f i lm of the present invention<br>
may be manufactured by laminating the multilayer gas<br>
barrier film and the multilayer substrate film according<br>
to a known method.<br>
As a laminating method, the above-mentioned dry<br>
lamination is preferable. Used adhesives include the<br>
same adhesives as those used in manufacture of the<br>
multilayer gas barrier film.<br>
When the cylindrical inflation film is adopted as<br>
the multilayer substrate film, the multilayer gas barrier<br>
f i lm may be laminated on both the right and back surfaces<br>
of the cylindrical multilayer substrate f i lm in the state<br>
of being flatly folded.<br>
Although the thickness of the entire medical gas<br>
barrier film is not specifically limited, it is preferably<br>
180 to 240 μm, more preferably 190 to 220 μm.<br>
Since the medical gas barrier f i lm has the deposition<br>
oriented polyester layer with the inorganic oxide<br>
deposited layer and the cyclic olefin polymer layer,<br>
excellent gas and vapor barrier properties can be obtained<br>
in the medical gas barrier film.<br>
Since (i) with respect to the oriented polyester film<br>
as its substrate, the deposited layer of the deposition<br>
oriented polyester layer is disposed on the side of the<br>
outer surface of the medical bag molded using the medical<br>
gas barrier film (that is, the side of the oriented<br>
polyamide film layer and polyethylene film layer), not on<br>
the side of the inner surface of the medical bag (that is,<br>
the side of the multilayer substrate film of the medical<br>
gas barrier film), and is protected by the oriented<br>
polyamide film layer and the polyethylene film layer, and<br>
(ii) since the oriented polyamide layer and the<br>
polyethylene layer are disposed between the deposited<br>
layer of the deposition oriented polyester layer and the<br>
outer surface of the medical bag to ensure enough thickness,<br>
even when the medical gas barrier film is subjected to<br>
heating and sterilizing treatment under high temperatures,<br>
excellent gas and vapor barrier properties can be realized,<br>
and furthermore, excellent gas and vapor barrier<br>
properties can be maintained while preventing degradation<br>
of the deposited layer (deterioration of gas and vapor<br>
properties of the medical gas barrier film over time).<br>
Since the medical gas barrier film has the<br>
polyethylene layer and the elastomer layer, sufficient<br>
flexibility is given to the whole of the film, and<br>
especially since the polyethylene layer is provided on the<br>
side closer to the film surface than the deposition<br>
oriented polyester layer and the oriented polyamide layer,<br>
creases and lines can be prevented from occurring on the<br>
surface when the infusion solution bag or the like is<br>
formed.<br>
Moreover, since the medical gas barrier film has the<br>
cyclic olefin polymer layer and the multilayer substrate<br>
film containing the cyclic olefin polymer layer is formed<br>
without using any adhesive, the compounding ingredients<br>
of the film and ingredients of the adhesive can be<br>
prevented from eluting from the surface of the heat sealing<br>
layer.<br>
The medical bag of the present invention is<br>
characterized in that it<br>
(I) is formed by welding the medical gas barrier film<br>
with the heat sealing layers facing each other, or<br>
(II) is formed by welding an open end of the<br>
multilayer substrate film in the medical gas barrier film<br>
of the present invention in which the multilayer substrate<br>
film is formed according to the inflation method.<br>
The above-mentioned medical bag in (I) maybe formed<br>
in the shape of a bag by superimposing two medical gas<br>
barrier films on each other so that their heat sealing<br>
layers face each other and heat sealing the<br>
circumferential part.<br>
Heat sealing condition in forming the<br>
circumferential part is not limited, but is a temperature<br>
of 170°C or higher, preferably 180 to 200°C for 3 to 5<br>
seconds.<br>
The medical bag of the present invention may be a<br>
so-called multi-chamber bag having two or more storage<br>
chambers divided by the peelable sealing part.<br>
The heat sealing temperature in forming the peelable<br>
sealing part is not limited to this but may be<br>
appropriately set so that peel strength of the peelable<br>
seal falls between 5.92 to 5.88 N/lSmm, for example, even<br>
after the medical bag is subjected to sterilizing<br>
treatment under 105 to 115°C. The specific heat sealing<br>
condition is set depending on the types of the resin<br>
forming the heat sealing layer, but it is, for example,<br>
preferably 140 to 155 = C, more preferably 140 to 145°C for<br>
4 to 5 seconds.<br>
The above-mentioned peel strength is measured<br>
according to a method "180 degrees peeling method"<br>
described in JIS Z 0237 "Adhesive Tape and Adhesive Sheet<br>
Test Method" . The peel strength is measured as a strength<br>
(N/15 mm) at the time when an elastic plastic film having<br>
a width of 15mm is cut with the peelable sealing part as<br>
a starting point and a pair of film parts of the measurement<br>
sample thus obtained are pulled in the direction of 180<br>
degrees between them at the rate of 200 mm/minute,<br>
resulting in peeling of the peelable seal.<br>
According to the present invention, to maintain<br>
excellent gas and vapor barrier properties of the medical<br>
bag, it is desirable to use a material having excellent<br>
gas and vapor barrier properties for a mouth member of the<br>
medical bag.<br>
Such mouth member (mouth port, etc.) is, for example,<br>
a polyethylene mouth member having an ethylene-vinyl<br>
alcohol copolymer (EVOH) layer, a cyclic olefin polymer<br>
layer and so on therein.<br>
It is preferred that the medical bag of the present<br>
invention is subjected to heating and sterilizing<br>
treatment in the state of being filled with a medical fluid<br>
and sealed.<br>
According to the medical bag of the present invention,<br>
since the medical gas barrier film forming the medical bag<br>
has the cyclic olefin polymer layer and the deposited layer<br>
of the deposition oriented polyester layer in the<br>
multilayer gas barrier film is disposed on the opposite<br>
side to the multilayer substrate film and protected by the<br>
oriented polyamide layer, even heating and sterilizing<br>
treatment under high temperatures is performed, excellent<br>
gas and vapor properties can be realized and deterioration<br>
of the deposited layer can also be prevented to maintain<br>
excellent gas and vapor properties.<br>
Furthermore/ according to the medical bag of the<br>
present invention, since the medical gas barrier film<br>
forming the medical bag has the cyclic olef in polymer layer,<br>
and the multilayer substrate film including the cyclic<br>
olefin polymer layer is formed without using any adhesive<br>
and is disposed on the inner side of the medical bag than<br>
the multilayer gas barrier film using the adhesive in<br>
lamination, compounding ingredients of the film and<br>
ingredients of the adhesive can be prevented from eluting.<br>

same manner as in Example 1 except that the cyclic olefin<br>
polymer layer 25 is not provided in the multilayer<br>
substrate film 22 of the medical gas barrier film having<br>
the layer configuration shown in Fig. 1. The medical bag<br>
shown in Fig. 2 was manufactured in the same manner as in<br>
Example I except that the medical gas barrier film thus<br>
obtained was used.<br>
Comparative example 2<br>
A medical gas barrier film was manufactured in the<br>
same manner as in Example 1 except that, in the deposition<br>
oriented polyester layer 11 of the multilayer gas barrier<br>
film 10 in the medical gas barrier film having the layer<br>
configuration shown in Fig. 1, the direction of laminating<br>
the oriented polyester film 12 and the deposited layer 13<br>
was reversed. The medical bag shown in Fig. 2 was<br>
manufactured in the same manner as in Example 1 except that<br>
the medical gas barrier film thus obtained was used.<br>
Comparative example 3<br>
A medical gas barrier film was manufactured in the<br>
same manner as in Example 1 except that the polyethylene<br>
layer 17 of the multilayer gas barrier film was not<br>
provided and the thickness of the oriented polyamide layer<br>
was 30 μm in the medical gas barrier film having the layer<br>
configuration shown in Fig. 1. The medical bag shown in<br>
Fig. 2 was manufactured in the same manner as in Example<br>
1 except that the medical gas barrier film thus obtained<br>
was used.<br><physical properties evaluation of the medical bag><br>
(1) Elution test, etc.<br>
The medical bags obtained in Examples 1 and 2 and<br>
Comparative examples 1 to 3 were subjected to high pressure<br>
steam sterilizing treatment (110°C, 60 minutes) and then<br>
test pieces were cut.<br>
Using the test pieces thus obtained, an "acute<br>
toxicity test", a "sensitization test" and a "hemolysis<br>
test" in conformance with rules of The Japanese<br>
Pharmacopoeia (14th revision), Part 1 "55. Test Methods<br>
for Plastic Containers - 2. Extraction Test" and "55. -7.<br>
Cytotoxicity Test" and The Japanese Pharmacopoeia (14tn<br>
version), Part 2 "13. Plastic Containers for<br>
Pharmaceutical Products " (Guideline on Basic Biological<br>
Tests of Medical Devices and Biomedical Materials, I.<br>
Cytotoxicity Test 10. Cytotoxicity Test Using Medical<br>
Devices and Extraction Liquid of Materials, II.<br>
Sensitization Test and VII. Hemolysis Test) were<br>
performed.<br>
(2) Measurement of transparency, oxygen<br>
transmission rate, etc.<br>
Further, using the test pieces, tests according to<br>
The Japanese Pharmacopoeia (14th revision), Part 1 "55.<br>
Test Methods for Plastic Containers - 4. Transparency<br>
Test" and "55. -5. Water Vapor Permeability" were<br>
performed, and oxygen transmission rate and sterilization<br>
shrinkage rate were measured.<br>
Oxygen transmission rate (cm3/m3/day) was measured<br>
under the conditions of temperature of 20'C and humidity<br>
of 60 %RH using an oxygen transmission rate measuring<br>
device (manufactured by MOCON Inc. (US), model name<br>
"OXTRAN 2/20").<br>
Oxygen transmission rate is preferably 0.2<br>
cm3/m3/day or less, more preferably 1 cm3/m3/day or less.<br>
Sterilization shrinkage rate (%) calculated by<br>
comparing test pieces cut from the medical bag before being<br>
subjected to high pressure steam sterilizing treatment<br>
with the above-mentioned test pieces in length shows the<br>
rate at which the medical gas barrier film is shrunk due<br>
to high pressure steam sterilizing treatment.<br>
Sterilization shrinkage rate is preferably 2.5 % or<br>
less, more preferably 1.0 % or less, in MD and preferably<br>
2.5 % or less, more preferably 1.0 % or less, in TD.<br>
(3) Drop test<br>
15 medical bags obtained in each of Example 1 and<br>
2 and Comparative example 1 to 3 were subjected to high<br>
pressure steam sterilizing treatment (IIO'C, 60 minutes)<br>
and then, five medical bags of each example were stacked<br>
in the state of being horizontally arranged, contained in<br>
an outer housing and stored at 0°C for two days. After<br>
storage, the medical bags were dropped from the height of<br>
120 cm and occurrence of leakage of liquid and presence<br>
or absence of gas and vapor barrier properties reduction<br>
were confirmed.<br>
With respect to gas and vapor barrier properties,<br>
oxygen transmission rate and vapor transmission rate after<br>
the drop test were measured in the same manner as the<br>
above-mentioned manner and when oxygen transmission rate<br>
exceeded 0.2 cm3/m3/day and vapor transmission rate<br>
exceeded 0.27 g/mVday, it was regarded that gas and vapor<br>
barrier properties were deteriorated.<br>
(4) Evaluation results<br>
The medical bags in Examples 1 and 2 satisfied<br>
reference values of all evaluation items in the tests (1) .<br>
On the contrary, in the medical bag in Comparative example<br>
I, elution of substances of the adhesive was found.<br>
It found that the medical bags in Examples 1 and 2<br>
had transparency of 82.5 %, oxygen transmission rate of<br>
0.04 cmVmVday (20°C, 60 %RH) , vapor transmission rate<br>
of 0.18 g/m3/day (40°C, 90 %RH) , and sterilization<br>
shrinkage rate of 1.3 (MD) and -0.3 (TD) , and showed<br>
excellent gas and vapor properties and extremely low<br>
shrinkage rate after sterilization treatment. On the<br>
contrary, it was found that the medical bags in Comparative<br>
examples 2 and 3 had increased oxygen transmission rate<br>
and vapor transmission rate by sterilization treatment and<br>
the medical bags in Comparative example 3 had lowered<br>
transparency by sterilization treatment.<br>
In the medical bags in Examples 1 and 2, even after<br>
the drop test was performed, no leakage of liquid was found<br>
and oxygen transmission rate and vapor transmission rate<br>
hardly changed. On the contrary, in the medical bags in<br>
Comparative example 2 contained in two of three outer<br>
housings, leakage of liquid was generated. Even in the<br>
medical bags generating no leakage of liquid, increase in<br>
oxygen transmission rate and vapor transmission rate was<br>
observed. In the medical bags in Comparative example 3,<br>
drop of flexibility and resulting occurrence of creases<br>
and lines were observed.<br>
