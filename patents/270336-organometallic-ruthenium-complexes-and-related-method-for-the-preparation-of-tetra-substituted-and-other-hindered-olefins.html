				<td>Technical Field<br>
This invention relates generally to olefin metathesis. Mpre particularly, the invention relates to organometallic ruthenium complexes and olefin metathesis methods using them to produce hindered olefins. The catalysts and methods of the invention have utility in the fields of catalysis, organic synthesis, and industrial chemistry.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Olefin metathesis catalysis is a powerful technology, which in recent years has received tremendous attention as a versatile method for the formation of carbon-carbon bonds and has numerous applications in organic synthesis and polymer chemistry. R.H. Grubbs, Handbook of Metathesis, Vol. 2 and 3; Wiley VCH, Weinheim, 2003. The family of olefin metathesis reactions includes, but is not limited to, ring-closing metathesis (RCM), cross metathesis (CM), ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP), and acyclic diene metathesis polymerization (ADMET). The success of olefin metathesis stems from the development of several well-defined transition metal complexes, such as the Schrock molybdenum catalysts and the Grubbs ruthenium catalysts. R.H. Grubbs, Handbook of Metathesis, Vol. 1; Wiley VCH, Weinheim, 2003. The molybdenum catalysts are generally highly active but are also highly sensitive to air, moisture, and to certain fimctional groups present in the olefinic substrate, the reaction solvent, or impurities. The ruthenium catalysts are much more robust than the molybdenum catalysts.<br>
The original first-generation ruthenium catalysts were primarily bisphosphine complexes of the general formula (PR3)2(X)2Ru=CHRa wherein X represents a halogen (e.g., CI, Br, or I), R represents an alkyl, cycloalkyl, or aryl group (e.g., butyl, cyclohexyl, or phenyl), and Ra represents an alkyl, alkenyl, or aryl group (e.g., methyl, CH=CMe2, phenyl, etc.). Examples of these types of catalysts are described in US Patent Nos. 5,312,940, 5,969,170 and 6,111,121, which are incorporated herein by reference. While they catalyze a considerable number of olefin metathesis transformations, these bisphosphine complexes can exhibit lower activity than desired.<br>
Second-generation metathesis catalysts with greatly increased activity have now been prepared by replacing one of the phosphine ligands with an N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligand to give complexes of the general formula (L)(PR3)(X)2Ru=CHRa wherein L represents an NHC ligand such as 1,3-dimesitylimidazole-2-ylidene (MES) and 1,3-dirnesityl-4,5-dihydroimidazol-2-ylidene (sIMES), X represents a halogen (e.g., CI, Br, or I), R represents an alkyl, cycloalkyl, or aryl group (e.g., butyl, cyclohexyl, or phenyl), and Ra represents an alkyl, alkenyl, or aryl group (e.g., methyl, CH=CMe2, phenyl, etc.). Examples of these types of NHC ligands and catalysts are described in PCT publications WO 99/51344 and WO 00/71554, which are incorporated herein by reference. Further examples of the synthesis and reactivity of some of these active ruthenium complexes are reported by A. Furstner, L. Ackermann, B. Gabor, R. Goddard, C.W. Lehmann, R. Mynott, F. Stelzer, and O.R. Thiel, Chem. Eur. J., 2001,7, No. 15, 3236-3253; Blackwell H,E., OTLeary D.J., Chatterjee A.K., Washenfelder R.A., Bussmann D;A., Grubbs R.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000, 122, 58-71; Chatterjee A.K., Morgan J.P., Scholl M., Grubbs R.H. /. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000, 122, 3783-3784; Chatterjee AJK.., Grubbs R.H. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2002, 41, 3171-3174; Chatterjee A.K., Choi T.L., Sanders D.P., Grubbs R.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003, 125, 11360-11370. The disclosure of these articles are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Despite such advances in the development of olefin metathesis catalysts, the metathesis of hindered olefins remains difficult and certain metathesis reactions to form tetra-substiruted olefins proceed slowly and in low to moderate yields. A need exists, therefore, for metathesis catalysts capable of efficiently and effectively carrying out metathesis reactions with hindered olefins. The ruthenium catalysts of this invention answer that need.<br>

The.spacer moiety may be substituted or unsubstituted. Preferred catalysts of the invention where L and R10 are linked include the following:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Examples of ruthenium complexes with chelating carbene Iigands, ligands linking the L ligand and the R10 substitutent, are also described in Kingsbury, J. S-; Harrity, J. P. A.; Bonitatebus, P. J., Jr.; Hoveyda, A. H.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999, 121, 791 and Garber, S. B.; Kingsbury, J. S.- Gray, B. L.; Hoveyda, A. H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000,122, 8168. Preferably, R10 is linked to L via spacer group being 2-5 atoms in length between L and R10, for example via an alkyl group, a cycoloalkyl group, or an aryl group. A preferred spacer group is a substituted or unsubstituted phenyl group.<br>
In the catalysts of the invention there is an N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligand which is a ligand comprising a 5-membered NHC ring, i.e., a carbene where the carbenic carbon atom is contained within a 5-membered cyclic structure. The 5-membered cyclic structure that contains the carbenic carbon atom also contains at least one nitrogen atom directly attached to the carbenic carbon atom and that nitrogen atom is substituted by a phenyl ring. The phenyl ring itself has a hydrogen (i.e. is unsubstituted) at either or both ortho positions but substituted at at least one ortho- or meta-position.<br>
As described in the preferred embodiments below, the 5-membered NHC ring may, in some circumstances, be part of a polycyclic group and the phenyl ring may be part of a polycyclic aryl group. Preferred NHC ligands are those of those of formulas (II)-(V):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
In the preferred NHC ligands of formulas (II) - (V) there are two preferred combinations of Rl, R2, and R3 which define the substitution pattern on the phenyl ring bound to the nitrogen atom bound to the carbene carbon. Note that in the NHC ligands used in the complexes of the invention, at least one ortho position on the phenyl ring is a hydrogen. In other words, the phenyl ring is always unsubstitued at least one ortho position. In certain preferred combinations of R1, R2, and R3 both ortho positions are hydrogen and, therefore, unsubstituted.   The preferred combinations of R1, R2, and R3 are:<br>

Synthesis of NHC ligands<br>
The NHC ligands of formulas (II) and (III) used to form the catalysts of the invention may be prepared from aniline derivatives using known procedures used to prepare other known NHC ligands, such as the second generation metathesis catalysts discussed above. The aniline derivative used bears the desired substituents and substitution pattern. Typically, two equivalents of the aniline derivative are reacted with glyoxal to begin the synthesis. Use of the two equivalents of the same aniline gives a symmetric NHC ligand. Asymmetric NHC ligands can be prepared by using two different -aniline derivatives. For asymmetric NHC ligands, the aniline derivatives are preferably reacted with the glyoxal in two separate steps to avoid a mixture of products.<br>
Alternatively, NHC ligands of formulas (II) and (III) maybe prepared by reacting two equivalents of the same aniline with oxalyl chloride. Subsequent reduction of the product bisamide yields a diamine that can be transformed by techniques known in the art to a salt, which is a direct NHC ligand precursor. For differentially substituted NHC ligands, typically, one aniline is reacted with ethyl chlorooxoacetate and the product of that reaction is reacted with the second aniline. Again, reduction of the product bisamide yields a diamine that can be transformed by techniques known in the art to a salt, which is a direct NHC ligand precursor. Examples of the preparation of NHC ligands of formulas (II) and (III) are shown below in Examples 1, 6,12, 13, and 17.<br>
Salt precursors of NHC ligands of formulas (IV) and (V) can be .prepared by a procedure similar to that described by Blechert and coworkers in Organometallics 2006, 25, 25-28: first a diamine R8NH-(CH2)2-NH2 is arylated under Buchwald-Hartwig conditions to give R8NH-(CH2)2-NH[C6HR,(R2)2R3]:, which is then reacted with triethylorthoformate in the presence of NH4BF4 to give the HBF4 salt precursor of NHC ligands of formula (IV). Salt precursors of NHC ligands of formula (V) can be prepared by reacting N-(substituted phenyl)imidazole (where substituted phenyl is C6HR1(R2)2R ) with an alkyl halide (where alkyl is R8) according to the procedure described by Furstner and coworkers in Organometallics 2004, 23, 280-287. The NHC ligands of formulas (IV) and (V) may be prepared by deprotonation of their corresponding NHC salts.<br>

Synthesis of catalysts<br>
The ruthenium catalysts of the invention may be prepared using methods known in the art. In general, the catalysts of the present invention are prepared via a ligand exchange reaction, for example, by substituting an NHC ligand for one of the neutral electron donor ligands in a first generation ruthenium carbene complexes (discussed above). For example, a catalyst of the invention can be prepared by replacing a phosphine Hgand in a complex of the general formula (PR3)2(X)2Ru=CHR with an NHC ligand described above. As discussed in the Background of the Invention, these synthetic procedures are known in the art.   Examples 2, 7, 11, 12, 14,. and 15 illustrate preparation of ruthenium catalysts of the invention by this method.<br>
Metathesis Reactions<br>
The ruthenium catalysts of the invention are particularly efficient olefin metathesis catalysts. Accordingly, one embodiment of the invention is an olefin metathesis reaction which contacts an olefin with an .^-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ruthenium olefin metathesis catalyst of the invention under metathesis conditions. The catalysts of the invention may be used in, for example, ring-closing metathesis (RCM), cross metathesis (CM), self metathesis (which is a type of cross metathesis), ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP), and acyclic diene metathesis polymerization (ADMET).<br>
The metathesis conditions for-the catalysts of the invention are the same as those used in other olefin metathesis reactions and with other known olefin metathesis catalysts. Generally speaking, the olefin metathesis reactions are run at a temperature ranging from about 10 °C to about 70 °G and for a time period ranging from about 5 minutes to about 24 hours. The catalysts of the invention maybe used in the same amounts as know for other olefin metathesis catalysts. Typically, about 1 to about 10 mol% of the catalyst is used and more often about 5 mol%.<br>
The ruthenium catalysts of the invention are particularly useful in metathesis reactions for the production of tetra-substituted cyclic olefins. The catalysts of the invention have significantly increased efficiency/activity for the preparation of tetra-substituted cyclic olefins via olefin metathesis. To answer the need for mere efficient preparation of such oJefins another embodiment of the invention is a ring-closing metathesis metiiod to prepare a. tetra-substituted cyclic olefin. The method contacts an olefinic compound having at least two terminal olefins which are substituted at the beta-carbon of each terminal olefin with an N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ruthenium olefin metathesis catalyst of the invention under metathesis conditions to form a cyclic tetra-substituted olefin.<br>

The catalysts are useful in cross-metathesis to prepare tri-substituted olefins, and di-substituted olefins which are further substituted at the allylic carbon. Accordingly, an embodiment of the invention relates to a cross-metathesis reaction in which an N-heterocycIic carbene (NHC) ruthenium olefin metathesis catalyst of the invention contacts two olefins under metathesis conditions. The first olefin is monosubstituted at the (3-carbon and either unsubstituted or monosubstituted at the œ-carbon.

Example 10: Stability studies.<br>
A striking feature of catalyst 12 is its stability. In solution (CH2Cl2 or Benzene), in the absence of substrate, it is stable for at least 4 weeks. As a solid, 12 is stable in air for at least 5 weeks. Finally, during the catalytic reactions described above, for the reactions performed at 30 °C the only time point the original catalyst was not observed by 1H NMR was 162 hours.   For the reaction performed at 60 °C, hone of the original catalyst was observed by 1H NMR at 24.8 hours. Overall, catalyst 12 is highly stable.<br>

H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004,126, 7414. Repeating the reactions using B and 12 with 10% 2,6-dichloroquinone added to consume any hydride formed, ( Hong, S. H.; Sanders, D. P.; Lee, C. W.; Grubbs, R. H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005, 127, 17160) catalyst B gave very poor conversion, but catalyst 12 gave 78% conversion to product with no byproduct formation. Overall, catalyst 12 performed as well as or better than B for all of the substrates.<br>
Example 26: Comparison of catalysts A, 12 and 7a in different ring-closing metathesis<br>
reactions to form tetrasubstiruted olefins.	.	.<br>
A procedure similar to that described in Example 8 was used to set up the ring-closing metathesis reactions and to follow their progress. The results are summarized in Table 16.<br>
Table 16. RCM to form tetrasubstituted olefins (E = CO2Et; Ts = tosyl). NR = no reaction.<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
 [a] 75% consumption of 17.<br>
 [b] 10% 2,6-dichlorobenzoquinone added. Without 2,6-dichlorobenzoquinone: 60% conversion to product, 95% consumption of 17.<br>
Example 27: Cross Metathesis (CM) Results with Catalyst 7a General procedure for CM reactions. A reflux condenser was attached to a flame-dried 10 mL 2-neck round bottom flask and the apparatus was flushed with argon. The flask was charged with solid catalyst and a stir bar. The second neck was closed with a septum, and dry, degassed C6H6 (2.5 mL) was added via syringe. The reagents were then added simultaneously via syringe. The solution was heated to 60 °C using an oil bath, and was stirred under argon for 18 h. The solution was then cooled to room temperature and concentrated. Conversions were measured by ]H NMR of this crude reaction mixture, and yields determined by isolating the desired products by silica gel column chromatography.<br>
Example 28: Preparation of bis (Pyridine) catalyst 28.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
In a nitrogen-filled glove box, pyridine (3.0 mL) was added to catalyst 6a (0.1 g, 0.126 mmol) and the solution was stirred until all of 6a had dissolved. The desired product was isolated by precipitation with pentane (0.0,70 g, 0.104 mmol, 83 % yield). Green crystalline solid. 1H NMR (300 MHz, C6D6): δ 19.30 (s), 9.51 (d), 8.53 (m), 7.92 (d), 7.25-7.05 (m), 7.00-6.77 (m), 6.64 (m), 6.51 (t), 6.22 (t), 3.08-3.64 (m), 2.49 (s), 2.31 (s).<br>
Example 29: Ring-closing metathesis reactions using catalysts 6a and 7a.<br>
The ring-closing reactions described in Example 22 were repeated using catalysts 6a and 7a with of substrates 13 and 15 to form the corresponding di- and tri-substituted olefins. The results are shown in Figs. 20 -23. Fig. 20 is a graph of the conversion of 15 over time for the RCM reaction for catalyst 6a.
