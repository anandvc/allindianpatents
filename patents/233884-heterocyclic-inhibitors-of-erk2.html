This application claims priority to US<br>
Provisional Patent Application 60/267,818 filed February<br>
9, 2001 and US Provisional Patent Application 60/328,768<br>
filed October 12, 2001, the contents of which are<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is in the field of<br>
medicinal chemistry and relates to pyrazole compounds<br>
that are protein kinase inhibitors, especially inhibitors<br>
of ERK, compositions containing such compounds and<br>
methods of use. The compounds are useful for treating<br>
cancer and other diseases that are alleviated by protein<br>
kinase inhibitors.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Mammalian mitogen-activated protein (MAP)1<br>
kinases are serine/threonine kinases that mediate<br>
5 intracellular signal transduction pathways (Cobb and<br>
Goldsmith, 1995, J Bio1. Chem., 270, 14843; Davis, 1995,<br>
Mol. Reprod. Dev. 42, 459) . Members of the MAP kinase<br>
family share sequence similarity and conserved structural<br>
domains, and include the ERK2 (extracellular signal<br>
10 regulated kinase) , JNK (Jun N-terminal kinase), and p38<br>
kinases. JNKs and p38 kinases are activated in response<br>
to the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and<br>
interleukin-l, and by cellular stress such as heat shock,<br>
hyperosmolarity, ultraviolet radiation,<br>
lipopolysaccharides and inhibitors of protein synthesis<br>
(Derijard et al., 1994, Cell 76, 1025; Han et al., 1994,<br>
Science 265, 808; Raingeaud et al. 1995, J Biol. Chem.<br>
270, 7420; Shapiro and Dinarello, 1995, Proc. Natl. Acad.<br>
Sex. USA 92, 12230). In contrast, ERKs are activated by<br>
mitogens and growth factors (Bokemeyer et al. . 1996,<br>
Kidney Int. 49, 1187) .<br>
ERK2 is a widely distributed protein kinase<br>
that achieves maximum activity when both Thrl83 and<br>
Tyrl8 5 are phosphorylated by the upstream MAP kinase<br>
kinase, MEK1 (Anderson et al., 1990, Nature 343, 651;<br>
Crews et al., 1992, Science 258, 478). Upon activation,<br>
ERK2 phosphorylates many regulatory proteins, including<br>
the protein kinases Rsk90 (Bjorbaek et al., 1995, J.<br>
Biol. Chem. 270, 18848) and MAPKAP2 (Rouse et al., 1994,<br>
Cell 78, 1027), and transcription factors such as ATF2<br>
(Raingeaud et al. , 1996, Mol. Cell Biol. 16, 1247), Elk-1<br>
(Raingeaud et al. 1996), c-Fos (Chen et al., 1993 Proc.<br>
Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90, 10952), and c-Myc (Oliver et<br>
al. , 1995, Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 210, 162). ERK2 is<br>
also a downstream target of the Ras/Raf dependent<br>
pathways (Moodie et al., 1993, Science 2 60, 1658) and may<br>
help relay the signals from these potentially oncogenic<br>
proteins. ERK2 has been shown to play a role in the<br>
negative growth control of breast cancer cells (Frey and<br>
Mulder, 1997, Cancer Res. 57, 628) and hyperexpression of<br>
ERK2 in human breast cancer has been reported (Sivaraman<br>
et al., 1997, J Clin. Invest. 99, 1478). Activated ERK2<br>
has also been implicated in the proliferation of<br>
endothelin-stimulated airway smooth muscle cells,<br>
suggesting a role for this kinase in asthma (Whelchel et<br>
al., 1997, Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 16, 589).<br>
Aurora-2 is a serine/threonine protein kinase<br>
that has been implicated in human cancer, such as colon,<br>
breast and other solid tumors. This kinase is believed<br>
to be involved in protein phosphorylation events that<br>
regulate the cell cycle. Specifically, Aurora-2 may play<br>
a role in controlling the accurate segregation of<br>
chromosomes during mitosis. Misregulation of the cell<br>
cycle can lead to cellular proliferation and other<br>
abnormalities. In human colon cancer tissue, the aurora-<br>
2 protein has been found to be overexpressed. See<br>
Bischoff et al., EMBO J. , 1998, 17, 3052-3065; Schumacher<br>
et al., J. Cell Biol., 1998, 143, 1635-1646; Kimura et<br>
al., J. Biol. Chem., 1997, 272, 13766-13771.<br>
Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) is a<br>
serine/threonine protein kinase comprised of a and p<br>
isoforms that are each encoded by distinct genes [Coghlan<br>
et al., Chemistry &amp; Biology, 7, 793-803 (2000); Kim and<br>
Kimmel, Curr. Opinion Genetics Dev. , 10, 508-514 (2000)].<br>
GSK-3 has been implicated in various diseases including<br>
diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, CNS disorders such as<br>
manic depressive disorder and neurodegenerative diseases,<br>
and cardiomyocete hypertrophy [WO 99/65897; WO 00/38675;<br>
and Hag et al., J. Cell Biol. (2000) 151, 117]. These<br>
diseases may be caused by, or result in, the abnormal<br>
operation of certain cell signaling pathways in which<br>
GSK-3 plays a role. GSK-3 has been found to<br>
phosphorylate and modulate the activity of a number of<br>
regulatory proteins. These proteins include glycogen<br>
synthase which is the rate limiting enzyme necessary for<br>
glycogen synthesis, the microtubule associated protein<br>
Tau, the gene transcription factor b-catenin, the<br>
translation initiation factor elF2B, as well as ATP<br>
citrate lyase, axin, heat shock factor-1, c-Jun, c-Myc,<br>
c-Myb, CREB, and CEPBa. These diverse protein targets<br>
implicate GSK-3 in many aspects of cellular metabolism,<br>
proliferation, differentiation and development.<br>
In a GSK-3 mediated pathway that is relevant<br>
for the treatment of type II diabetes, insulin-induced<br>
signaling leads to cellular glucose uptake and glycogen<br>
synthesis. Along this pathway, GSK-3 is a negative<br>
regulator of the insulin-induced signal. Normally, the<br>
presence of insulin causes inhibition of GSK-3 mediated<br>
phosphorylation and deactivation of glycogen synthase.<br>
The inhibition of GSK-3 leads to increased glycogen<br>
synthesis and glucose uptake [Klein et al., PNAS, 93,<br>
8455-9 (1996); Cross et al., Biochem. J., 303, 21-26<br>
(1994); Cohen, Biochem. Soc. Trans., 21, 555-567 (1993);<br>
Massillon et al., Biochem J. 299, 123-128 (1994)].<br>
However, in a diabetic patient where the insulin response<br>
is impaired, glycogen synthesis and glucose uptake fail<br>
to increase despite the presence of relatively high blood<br>
levels of insulin. This leads to abnormally high blood<br>
levels of glucose with acute and long term effects that<br>
may ultimately result in cardiovascular disease, renal<br>
failure and blindness. In such patients, the normal<br>
insulin-induced inhibition of GSK-3 fails to occur. It<br>
has also been reported that in patients with type II<br>
diabetes, GSK-3 is overexpressed [WO 00/38675].<br>
Therapeutic inhibitors of GSK-3 therefore are considered<br>
to be useful for treating diabetic patients suffering<br>
from an impaired response to insulin.<br>
GSK-3 activity has also been associated with<br>
Alzheimer's disease. This disease is characterized by<br>
the well-known P-amyloid peptide and the formation of<br>
intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. The<br>
neurofibrillary tangles contain hyperphosphorylated Tau<br>
protein where Tau is phosphorylated on abnormal sites.<br>
GSK-3 has been shown to phosphorylate these abnormal<br>
sites in cell and animal models. Furthermore, inhibition<br>
of GSK-3 has been shown to prevent hyperphosphorylation<br>
of Tau in cells [Lovestone et al., Current Biology 4,<br>
1077-86 (1994); Brownlees et al., Neuroreport 8, 3251-55<br>
(1997)]. Therefore, it is believed that GSK-3 activity<br>
may promote generation of the neurofibrillary tangles and<br>
the progression of Alzheimer's disease.<br>
Another substrate of GSK-3 is (3-catenin which<br>
is degradated after phosphorylation by GSK-3. Reduced<br>
levels of ßcatenin have been reported in schizophrenic<br>
patients and have also been associated with other<br>
diseases related to increase in neuronal cell death<br>
[Zhong et al., Nature, 395, 698-702 (1998); Takashima et<br>
al., PNAS, 90, 7789-93 (1993); Pei et al., J.<br>
Neuropathol. Exp, 56, 70-78 (1997)].<br>
As a result of the biological importance of<br>
GSK-3, there is current interest in therapeutically<br>
effective GSK-3 inhbitors. Small molecules that inhibit<br>
GSK-3 have recently been reported [WO 99/65897 (Chiron)<br>
and WO 00/38675 (SmithKline Beecham)].<br>
Aryl substituted pyrroles are known in the<br>
literature. In particular, tri-aryl pyrroles (US<br>
5,837,719) have been described as having glucagon<br>
antagonist activity. 1,5-Diarylpyrazoles have been<br>
described as p38 inhibitors (WO 9958523).<br>
There is a high unmet medical need to develop<br>
new therapeutic treatments that are useful in treating<br>
the various conditions associated with ERK2 activation.<br>
For many of these conditions the currently available<br>
treatment options are inadequate.<br>
Accordingly, there is great interest in new and<br>
effective inhibitors of protein kinase, including ERK2<br>
inhibitors, that are useful in treating various<br>
conditions associated with protein kinase activation.<br>

CO2(C1-4 aliphatic), -O(halo C1-4 aliphatic), or halo C1-4<br>
aliphatic.<br>
An aliphatic group or a non-aromatic<br>
heterocyclic ring may contain one or more substituents.<br>
Suitable substituents on the saturated carbon of an<br>
aliphatic group or of a non-aromatic heterocyclic ring<br>
are selected from those listed above for the unsaturated<br>
carbon of an aryl or heteroaryl group and the following:<br>
=0, =S, =NNHR*, =NN(R*)2, =N-, =NNHC (o) R*, =NNHC02 (alkyl),<br>
=NNHS02(alkyl), or =NR*, where each.R* is independently<br>
selected from hydrogen or an optionally substituted C1-6<br>
aliphatic. Substituents on the aliphatic group of R* are<br>
selected from NH2, NH(d-4 aliphatic), N(C1.4 aliphatic)2,<br>
halogen, C1.4 aliphatic, OH, O- (C1.4 aliphatic) , No2, CN,<br>
CO2H, CO2(C1.4 aliphatic), -O(halo C1-4 aliphatic), or halo<br>

hydrogen, an optionally substituted C1-6 aliphatic,<br>
optionally substituted phenyl (Ph), optionally<br>
substituted -O(Ph), optionally substituted -CH2(Ph),<br>
optionally substituted -CH2CH2(Ph), or an unsubstituted 5-<br>

on the aliphatic group or the phenyl ring of R+ are<br>
selected from NH2, NH(C1.4 aliphatic), N(d1.4 aliphatic)2/<br>
halogen, C^ aliphatic, OH, O- (Ci_4 aliphatic) , N02/ CN,<br>
C02H, CO2(C1.4 aliphatic), -0(halo C1.4 aliphatic), or halo<br>

The term "alkylidene chain" refers to an<br>
optionally substituted, straight or branched carbon chain<br>
that may be fully saturated or have one or more units of<br>
unsaturation. The optional substituents are as described<br>
above for an aliphatic group.<br>
The term "spacer group" refers to a group that<br>
separates and orients other parts of the molecule<br>
attached thereto, such that the compound favorably<br>
interacts with functional groups in the active site of an<br>
enzyme. As used herein, the spacer group separates and<br>
orients ring A and QR2 within the active site such that<br>
they may form favorable interactions with functional<br>
groups which exist within the active site of the ERK2<br>
enzyme. When the spacer group is a 5-membered<br>
heteroaromatic ring, ring A and QR2 are attached at non-<br>
adjacent positions "B" and "C", and the 5-membered ring<br>
is attached to ring A at point "D" and to QR2 at point "E"<br>
as illustrated below.<br>
Preferably, the distance between "D" and "C" is 3.7A, the<br>
distance between "D" and "E" is 5.0A, the distance<br>
between "B" and "C" is 2.2A, and the distance between "B"<br>
and "E" is 3 . 5A , wherein each of the above described<br>
distances is plus/minus 0.2 A.<br>
The spacer group itself may also form<br>
additional interactions within the active site to further<br>
enhance inhibitory activity of the compounds. For<br>
example, when Sp is a pyrrole the pyrrole-NH may form an<br>
additional hydrogen bond within the active site of the<br>
ERK2 enzyme.<br>
The term "linker group" means an organic moiety<br>
that connects two parts of a compound. Linkers are<br>
typically comprised of an atom such as oxygen or sulfur,<br>
a unit such as -NH-, -CH2-, -CO-, or a chain of atoms,<br>
such as an alkylidene chain. The molecular mass of a<br>
linker is typically in the range of about 14 to 200.<br>
Examples of linkers include a saturated or unsaturated<br>
C1-6 alkylidene chain which is optionally substituted, and<br>
wherein up to two saturated carbons of the chain are<br>
optionally replaced by -C(0)-, -C(O)C(O)-, -CONR7-,<br>
-C0NR7NR7-, -C02-, -OC(O)-, -NR7CO2-, -O-, -NR7CONR7- ,<br>
-OC(O)NR7-, -NR7NR7-, -NR7C0-, -S-, -SO-, -SO2-, -NR7-,<br>
-SO2NR7-, or -NR7SO2-.<br>
As used herein, linker group Q connects Sp with<br>
R2. Q may also form additional interactions within the<br>
ERK2 binding site to further enhance the inhibitory<br>
activity of the compound. When Q is a carbonyl-<br>
containing moeity such as -C(O)-, -CO2-, -OC(O)-,<br>
-C(O)C(O)-, -CONH-, -CO2NH-, -CONHNH-, -NHCO-, -OC(O)NH-,<br>
or -NHCO2-, or a sulfonyl-containing moeity such as -SO2-,<br>
-SO2NH-, or -NHSO2-, the carbonyl or sulf onyl oxygen forms<br>
a hydrogen-bond with lysine 54 in the ERK2 binding site.<br>
When Q is an NH-containing moeity such as -CH2NH- or<br>
-NHNH-, the NH-group forms a hydrogen-bond with aspartic<br>
acid residue 167 in the ERK2 binding site. When Q is a<br>
hydrophobic group such as an alkyl chain, -0-, or -S-, Q<br>
forms additional hydrophobic interactions within the ERK2<br>
binding site.<br>
R2 forms hydrophobic interactions within the<br>
binding site of ERK2, especially with the side-chain<br>
carbons of lysine 54 and aspartic acid 167. R2 may also<br>
form hydrophobic interactions with the glycine-rich loop<br>
which is made up of amino-acid residues 33-38. When R2 is<br>
substituted, the substituents may form further<br>
interactions within the binding site to enhance the<br>
inhibitory activity of the compound. For example, when a<br>
substituent on R2 is a hydrogen-bond donor or a hydrogen-<br>
bond acceptor, said substituent forms a hydrogen bond<br>
with enzyme-bound water molecules that exist in the<br>
binding site.<br>
As used herein, linker group T, when present,<br>
connects Sp with R1. T may also form additional<br>
interactions within the ERK2 binding site to further<br>
enhance the inhibitory activity of the compound. When T<br>
is carbonyl-containing such as -CO-, -C02-, -0C0-, -COCO-,<br>
-CONH-, -CO2NH-, -CONHNH-, -NHCO-, or -NHCO2-, or<br>
sulfonyl-containing such as -SO2-, -S02NH-, or -NHSO2-,<br>
the carbonyl or sulfonyl oxygen forms a hydrogen-bond<br>
with the NH of glutamine 105 in the ERK2 binding site.<br>
When T is NH-containing such as -CH2NH- or -NHNH-, the NH-<br>
group forms a hydrogen-bond with the carbonyl of<br>
glutamine 105. When T is a hydrophobic group such as an<br>
alkyl chain, -0-, or -S-, T forms additional hydrophobic<br>
interactions with the side-chain carbons of glutamine 105<br>
as well as isoleucine 84.<br>
The binding interactions described herein<br>
between the compounds of this invention and the ERK2<br>
binding site have been determined by molecular modeling<br>

intraperitoneally or intravenously.<br>
Sterile injectable forms of the compositions of<br>
this invention may be aqueous or oleaginous suspension.<br>
These suspensions may be formulated according to<br>
techniques"known in the art using suitable dispersing or<br>
wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile<br>
injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable<br>
solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally-<br>
acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a solution<br>
in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and<br>
solvents that may be employed are water. Ringer's<br>
solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In<br>
addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed<br>
as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose, any<br>
bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono-<br>
or di-glycerides. Fatty acids, such as oleic acid and<br>
its glyceride derivatives are useful in the preparation<br>
of injectables, as are natural pharmaceutically-<br>
acceptable oils, such as olive oil or castor oil,<br>
especially in their polyoxyethylated versions. These oil<br>
solutions or suspensions may also contain a long-chain<br>
alcohol diluent or dispersant, such as carboxymethyl<br>
cellulose or similar dispersing agents which are commonly<br>
used in the formulation of pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
dosage forms including emulsions and suspensions. Other<br>
commonly used surfactants, such as Tweens, Spans and<br>
other emulsifying agents or bioavailability enhancers<br>
which are commonly used in the manufacture of<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable solid, liquid, or other<br>
dosage forms may also be used for the purposes of<br>
formulation.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of this<br>
invention may be orally administered in any orally<br>
acceptable dosage form including, but not limited to,<br>
capsules, tablets, aqueous suspensions or solutions. In<br>

include lactose and corn starch. Lubricating agents,<br>
such as magnesium stearate, are also typically added.<br>
For oral administration in a capsule form, useful<br>
diluents include lactose and dried cornstarch. When<br>
aqueous suspensions are required for oral use, the active<br>
ingredient is combined with emulsifying and suspending<br>
agents. If desired, certain sweetening, flavoring or<br>
coloring agents may also be added.<br>
Alternatively, the pharmaceutical compositions<br>
of this invention may be administered in the form of<br>
suppositories for rectal administration. These can be<br>
prepared by mixing the agent with a suitable non-<br>
irritating excipient which is solid at room temperature<br>
but liquid at rectal temperature and therefore will melt<br>
in the rectum to release the drug. Such materials<br>
include cocoa butter, beeswax and polyethylene glycols.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of this<br>
invention may also be administered topically, especially<br>
when the target of treatment includes areas or organs<br>
readily accessible by topical application, including<br>
diseases of the eye, the skin, or the lower intestinal<br>
tract. Suitable topical formulations are readily<br>
prepared for each of these areas or organs.<br>
Topical application for the lower intestinal<br>
tract can be effected in a rectal suppository formulation<br>
-23-<br>
(see above) or in a suitable enema formulation.<br>
Topically-transdermal patches may also be used.<br>

one or more carriers. Carriers for topical<br>
administration of the compounds of this invention<br>
include, but are not limited to, mineral oil, liquid<br>
petrolatum, white petrolatum, propylene glycol,<br>
polyoxyethylene, poloxypropylene compound, emulsifying<br>
wax and water. Alternatively, the pharmaceutical<br>
compositions can be formulated in a suitable lotion or<br>
cream containing the active components suspended or<br>
dissolved in one or more pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
carriers. Suitable carriers include, but are not limited<br>
to, mineral oil, sorbitan monostearate, polysorbate 60,<br>
cetyl esters wax, cetearyl alcohol, 2-octyldodecanol,<br>
benzyl alcohol and water.<br>
For ophthalmic use, the pharmaceutical<br>
compositions may be formulated as micronized suspensions<br>
in isotonic, pH adjusted sterile saline, or, preferably,<br>
as solutions in isotonic, pH adjusted sterile saline,<br>
either with or without a preservative such as<br>
benzylalkonium chloride. Alternatively, for ophthalmic<br>
uses, the pharmaceutical compositions may be formulated<br>
in an ointment such as petrolatum.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of this<br>
invention may also be administered by nasal aerosol or<br>
inhalation. Such compositions are prepared according to<br>
techniques well-known in the art of pharmaceutical<br>
formulation and may be prepared as solutions in saline,<br>
employing benzyl alcohol or other suitable preservatives,<br>
absorption promoters to enhance bioavailability,<br>
fluorocarbons, and/or other conventional solubilizing or<br>
dispersing agents.<br>

A "pharmaceutically acceptable derivative "<br>
means any pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester, salt<br>
of an ester or other derivative of a compound of this<br>
invention which, upon administration to a recipient, is<br>
capable of providing, either directly or indirectly, a<br>
compound of this invention or an inhibitorily active<br>
metabolite or residue thereof. Particularly favored<br>
derivatives are those that increase the bioavailability<br>
of the compounds of this invention when such compounds<br>
are administered to a patient (e.g., by allowing an<br>
orally administered compound to be more readily absorbed<br>
into the blood) or which enhance delivery of the parent<br>
compound to a biological compartment (e.g., the brain or<br>
lymphatic system) relative to the parent species.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the<br>
compounds of this invention include those derived from<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic and organic acids<br>

themselves pharmaceutically acceptable, may be employed<br>
in the preparation of salts useful as intermediates in<br>
obtaining the compounds of the invention and their<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts.<br>
Salts derived from appropriate bases include<br>
alkali metal (e.g., sodium and potassium), alkaline earth<br>
metal (e.g., magnesium), ammonium and N+ (C1.4 alkyl)4<br>
salts. This invention also envisions the quaternization<br>
of any basic nitrogen-containing groups of the compounds<br>
disclosed herein. Water or oil-soluble or dispersible<br>
products may be obtained by such quaternization.<br>
The amount of the protein kinase inhibitor that<br>
may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a<br>
single dosage form will vary depending upon the patient<br>
treated and the particular mode of administration.<br>
Preferably, the compositions should be formulated so that<br>
a dosage of between 0.01 - 100 mg/kg body weight/day of<br>
the inhibitor can be administered to a patient receiving<br>
these compositions.<br>
It should also be understood that a specific<br>
dosage and treatment regimen for any particular patient<br>
will depend upon a variety of factors, including the<br>
activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body<br>
weight, general health, sex, diet, time of<br>
administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, and<br>
the judgment of the treating physician and the severity<br>
of the particular disease being treated. The amount of<br>
the inhibitor will also depend upon the particular<br>
compound in the composition.<br>
The kinase inhibitors of this invention or<br>
pharmaceutical compositions thereof may also be<br>
incorporated into compositions for coating an implantable<br>
medical device, such as prostheses, artificial valves,,<br>
vascular grafts, stents and catheters. Vascular stents,<br>
for example, have been used to overcome restenosis (re-<br>
narrowing of the vessel wall after injury). However,<br>
patients using stents or other implantable devices risk<br>
clot formation or platelet activation. These unwanted<br>
effects may be prevented or mitigated by pre-coating the<br>
device with a pharmaceutically acceptable composition<br>
comprising a kinase inhibitor. Suitable coatings and the<br>
general preparation of coated implantable devices are<br>
described in US Patents 6,099,562; 5,886,026; and<br>
5,304,121. The coatings are typically biocompatible<br>
polymeric materials such as a hydrogel polymer,<br>
polymethyldisiloxane, polycaprolactone, polyethylene<br>
glycol, polylactic acid, ethylene vinyl acetate, and<br>
mixtures thereof. The coatings may optionally be further<br>
covered by a suitable topcoat of fluorosilicone,<br>
polysaccarides, polyethylene glycol, phospholipids or<br>
combinations thereof to impart controlled release<br>
characteristics in the composition. Implantable devices<br>
coated with a kinase inhibitor of this invention are<br>
another embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Depending upon the particular protein kinase-<br>
mediated condition to be treated or prevented, additional<br>
therapeutic agents, which are normally administered to<br>
treat or prevent that condition, may be administered<br>
together with the inhibitors of this invention. For<br>
example, in the treatment of cancer other<br>
chemotherapeutic agents or other anti-proliferative<br>
agents may be combined with the protein kinase inhibitors<br>
of this invention to treat cancer. These agents include,<br>
without limitation, adriamycin, dexamethasone,<br>
vincristine, cyclophosphamide, fluorouracil, topotecan,<br>
taxol, interferons, and platinum derivatives.<br>
Other examples of agents the inhibitors of this<br>
invention may also be combined with include, without<br>
limitation, agents for treating diabetes such as insulin<br>
or insulin analogues, in injectable or inhalation form,<br>
glitazones, alpha glucosidase inhibitors, biguanides,<br>
insulin sensitizers, and sulfonyl ureas; anti-<br>
inflammatory agents such as corticosteroids, TNF<br>
blockers, IL-1 RA, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, and<br>
sulfasalazine; immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive<br>
agents such as cyclosporin, tacrolimus, rapamycin,<br>
mycophenolate mofetil, interferons, corticosteroids,<br>
cyclophophamide, azathioprine, and sulfasalazine;<br>
neurotrophic factors such as acetylcholinesterase<br>
inhibitors, MAO inhibitors, interferons, anti-<br>
convulsants, ion channel blockers, riluzole, and anti-<br>
Parkinsonian agents; agents for treating cardiovascular<br>
disease such as beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, diuretics,<br>
nitrates, calcium channel blockers, and statins; agents<br>
for treating liver disease such as corticosteroids,<br>
cholestyramine, interferons, and anti-viral agents;<br>
agents for treating blood disorders such as<br>
corticosteroids, anti-leukemic agents, and growth<br>
factors; and agents for treating immunodeficiency<br>
disorders such as gamma globulin.<br>
Those additional agents may be administered<br>
separately from the protein kinase inhibitor-containing<br>
composition, as part of a multiple dosage regimen.<br>
Alternatively, those agents may be part of a single<br>
dosage form, mixed together with the protein kinase<br>
inhibitor of this invention in a single composition.<br>
Compounds of this invention may exist in<br>
alternative tautomeric forms. Unless otherwise<br>
indicated, the representation of either tautomer is meant<br>
to include the other.<br>

The present compounds may be prepared in<br>
general by methods known to those skilled in the art for<br>
analogous compounds, as illustrated by the general<br>
Schemes I through XII and the synthetic examples shown<br>
below.<br>
Reagents and conditions: (a) TmR1CH2COCl, A1C13/ CH2C12, 2<br>
hours, RT; (b) DMF, 24 hrs, room temperature; (c) (Me2N)2-<br>
CHOt-Bu, THF, 24 hrs, room temperature; (d) guanidine,<br>
EtOH, 12 hours, reflux; (e) thiourea, EtOH, K2CO3, 12 hrs<br>
reflux; (f) m-CPBA, EtOH; (g) UnR3-NH2, DMSO, 130"C.<br>
Scheme I above shows a general synthetic route<br>
that is used for preparing the pyrrol-3-yl compounds of<br>
formula III-a of this invention when R2 is an optionally<br>
substituted phenyl group or aliphatic group. In step<br>
(a), an optionally substituted acid chloride is combined<br>
with compound 1, dichloromethane, and aluminum<br>
trichloride to form compound 2. In cases where benzoyl<br>
acid chlorides are used, a wide variety of substituents<br>
on the phenyl ring are amenable to this reaction.<br>
Aliphatic acid chlorides are also used in many cases.<br>
Examples of suitable R2 groups include, but are not<br>
limited to, those set forth in Table 1 above.<br>
The formation of amide 4 is achieved by-<br>
treating compound 2 with an amine 3 in DMF. When atnine 3<br>
5 is a primary amine, the reaction proceeds at ambient<br>
temperature. When amine 3_ is a. secondary amine, the<br>
reaction is heated at 50°C to achieve complete reaction<br>
and afford amide 4.<br>
The formation of enamine 5 at step (c) is<br>
) achieved by treating amide 4 with (Me2N)2-CHOt-Bu at<br>
ambient temperature. Alternatively, the reaction to form<br>
enamine 5 at step (c) is also achieved by using<br>
dimethylformamide-dimethylacetal (DMF-DMA). The reaction<br>
using DMF-DMA typically requires elevated temperature to<br>
afford enamine 5 whereas using (Me2N)2-OtBu has the<br>
advantage of proceeding at ambient temperature to afford<br>
the enamine 5 in higher purity.<br>
The formation of the pyrimidine compound 6 at<br>
step (d) is achieved by the treatment of enamine 5 with<br>
guanidine at elevated temperature. Alternatively, use of<br>
a substituted guanidine results in an amino substituent<br>
as is illustrated by J3.<br>
As an alternative method, in step (e)<br>
intermediate _5 may be cyclized with S-methyl thiourea to<br>
form the 2-thiomethylpyrimidine 7 which may in turn be<br>
oxidized with m-CPBA to the sulfone. The sulfonyl group<br>
may be subsequently displaced by an amine to generate the<br>
substituted aminopyrimidine 8.<br>

BIOLOGICAL TESTING<br>
The activity of the present compounds as<br>
protein kinase inhibitors may be assayed in vitro, in<br>
vivo or in a cell line. In vitro assays include assays<br>
that determine inhibition of either the phosphorylatiori<br>
activity or ATPase activity of the activated protein<br>
kinase. Alternate in vitro assays guantitate the ability<br>
of the inhibitor to bind to the protein kinase.<br>
Inhibitor binding may be measured by radiolabelling the<br>
inhibitor prior to binding, isolating the<br>
inhibitor/protein kinase complex and determining the<br>
amount of radiolabel bound. Alternatively, inhibitor<br>
binding may be determined by running a competition<br>
experiment where new inhibitors are incubated with the<br>
protein kinase bound to known radioligands. The details<br>
of the conditions used for performing these assays are<br>
set forth in Examples 3 0 through 37.<br>

reaction were obtained by monitoring absorbance at 340 nm<br>
over a 5-minute read time at 30 °C using a BioRad<br>
Ultramark plate reader (Hercules, CA) . The Ki values were<br>
determined from the rate data as a function of inhibitor<br>
concentration.<br>
The following compounds were shown to have Ki<br>
values than 0.1 µM for CDK-2: III-a-116, III-a-142, III-<br>
a-149, and III-a-152.<br>
The following compounds were shown to have Ki<br>
values between 0.1 µM and 1 µM for CDK-2: III-a-146, III-<br>
a-148, III-a-150, III-a-155, III-a-162, and III-a-174.<br>
The following compounds were shown to have Ki<br>
values between 1.0 and 20.0 µM for CDK-2: III-a-117, III-<br>
a-156, and III-a-159.<br>

LCK INHIBITION ASSAY<br>
The compounds were evaluated as inhibitors of<br>
human Lck kinase using either a radioactivity-based assay<br>
or spectrophotometric assay.<br>
Lck Inhibition Assay A: Radioactivity-based Assay<br>
The compounds were assayed as inhibitors of<br>
full length bovine thymus Lck kinase (from Upstate<br>
Biotechnology, cat. no. 14-106) expressed and purified<br>
from baculo viral cells. Lck kinase activity was<br>
monitored by following the incorporation of 33P from ATP<br>
into the tyrosine of a random poly Glu-Tyr polymer<br>
substrate of composition, Glu.-Tyr = 4:1 (Sigma, cat. no.<br>
ß0275). The following were the final concentrations of<br>
the assay components: 0.025 M HEPES, pH 7.6, 10 mM MgCl2,<br>
2 mM DTT, 0.25 mg/ml BSA, 10 uM ATP (1-2 uCi 33P-ATP per<br>
reaction), 5 mg/ml poly Glu-Tyr, and 1-2 units of<br>
recombinant human Src kinase. In a typical assay, all<br>
the reaction components with the exception of ATP were<br>
pre-mixed and aliquoted into assay plate wells.<br>
Inhibitors dissolved in DMSO were added to the wells to<br>
give a final DMSO concentration of 2.5%. The assay plate<br>
was incubated at 30 C for 10 min before initiating the<br>
reaction with 33P-ATP. After 20 min of reaction, the<br>
reactions were quenched with 150 ul of 10%<br>
trichloroacetic acid (TCA) containing 20 mM Na3PO4. The<br>
quenched samples were then transferred to a 96-well<br>
filter plate (Whatman, UNI-Filter GF/F Glass Fiber<br>
Filter, cat no. 7700-3310) installed on a filter plate<br>
vacuum manifold. Filter plates were washed four times<br>
with 10% TCA containing 20 mM Na3PO4 and then 4 times with<br>
methanol. 200ul of scintillation fluid was then added to<br>
each well. The plates were sealed and the amount of<br>
radioactivity associated with the filters was quantified<br>
on a TopCount scintillation counter. The radioactivity<br>
incorporated was plotted as a function of the inhibitor<br>
concentration. The data was fitted to a competitive<br>
inhibition kinetics model to get the Ki for the compound.<br>
Lck Inhibition Assay B: Spectrophotometric Assay<br>
The ADP produced from ATP by the human<br>
recombinant Lck kinase-catalyzed phosphorylation of poly<br>
Glu-Tyr substrate was quanitified using a coupled enzyme<br>
assay (Fox et al (1998)' Protein Sci 7, 2249) . In this<br>
assay one molecule of NADH is oxidised to NAD for every<br>
molecule of ADP produced in the kinase reaction. The<br>
disappearance of NADH can be conveniently followed at 340<br>
nm.<br>
The following were the final concentrations of<br>
the assay components: 0.025 M HEPES, pH 7.6, 10 mM MgCl2,<br>
2 mM DTT, 5 mg/ml poly Glu-Tyr, and 5 0 nM of recombinant<br>
human Lck kinase. Final concentrations of the components<br>
of the coupled enzyme system were 2.5 mM<br>
phosphoenolpyruvate, 2 00 uM NADH, 3 0 ug/ml pyruvate<br>
kinase and 10 ug/ml lactate dehydrogenase.<br>
In a typical assay, all the reaction components<br>
with the exception of ATP were pre-mixed and aliquoted<br>
into assay plate wells. Inhibitors dissolved in DMSO<br>
were added to the wells to give a final DMSO<br>
concentration of 2.5%. The assay plate was incubated at<br>
30 °C for 10 min before initiating the reaction with 150<br>
uM ATP. The absorbance change at 34 0 nm with time, the<br>
rate of the reaction, was monitored on a molecular<br>
devices plate reader. The data of rate as a function of<br>
the inhibitor concentration was fitted to competitive<br>
inhibition kinetics model to get the Ki for the compound.<br>
The following compounds were shown to have Ki<br>
values than 1 µM for Lck: III-a-170, III-a-171, Ill-a-<br>
172, III-a-173, III-a-181, and III-a-203.<br>
The following compounds were shown to have Ki<br>
values between l.o and 20.0 µM for Lck: III-a-204, Ill-a-<br>
205, III-a-206, and III-a-207.<br>

AKT3 INHIBITION ASSAY<br>
Compounds were screened for their ability to<br>
inhibit AKT3 using a standard coupled enzyme assay (Fox<br>
et al., Protein Sci., (1998) 7, 224 9). Assays were<br>
carried out in a mixture of 100 mM HEPES 7.5, 10 mM<br>
MgCl2, 25 mM NaCl , 1 mM DTT and 1.5% DMSO. Final<br>
substrate concentrations in the assay were 170 uM ATP<br>
(Sigma Chemicals) and 200 uM peptide (RPRAATF, American<br>
Peptide, Sunnyvale, CA). Assays were carried out at 30<br>
"C and 45 nM AKT3. Final concentrations of the<br>
components of the coupled enzyme system were 2.5 mM<br>
phosphoenolpyruvate, 3 00 uM NADH, 3 0 ug/ML pyruvate<br>
kinase and 10 ug/ml lactate dehydrogenase.<br>
An assay stock buffer solution was prepared<br>
containing all of the reagents listed above, with the<br>
exception of AKT3, DTT, and the test compound of<br>
interest. 56 ul of the stock solution was placed in a<br>
384 well plate followed by addition of 1 ul of 2 mM DMSO<br>
stock containing the test compound (final compound<br>
concentration 30 uM). The plate was preincubated for<br>
about 10 minutes at 30°C and the reaction initiated by<br>
addition of 10 µl of enzyme (final concentration 45 nM)<br>
and 1 mM DTT. Rates of reaction were obtained using a<br>
BioRad Ultramark plate reader (Hercules, CA) over a 5<br>
minute read time at 30 0C. Compounds showing greater than<br>
50% inhibition versus standard wells containing the assay<br>
mixture and DMSO without test compound were titrated to<br>
determine IC50 values.<br><br>
Selected compounds of this invention that<br>
inhibit AKT3 include: III-a-238.<br>

Mammalian mitogen-activated protein (MAP)1<br>
kinases are serine/threonine kinases that mediate<br>
5 intracellular signal transduction pathways (Cobb and<br>
Goldsmith, 1995, J Bio1. Chem., 270, 14843; Davis, 1995,<br>
Mol. Reprod. Dev. 42, 459) . Members of the MAP kinase<br>
family share sequence similarity and conserved structural<br>
domains, and include the ERK2 (extracellular signal<br>
10 regulated kinase) , JNK (Jun N-terminal kinase), and p38<br>
kinases. JNKs and p38 kinases are activated in response<br>
to the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and<br>
interleukin-l, and by cellular stress such as heat shock,<br>
hyperosmolarity, ultraviolet radiation,<br>
lipopolysaccharides and inhibitors of protein synthesis<br>
(Derijard et al., 1994, Cell 76, 1025; Han et al., 1994,<br>
Science 265, 808; Raingeaud et al. 1995, J Biol. Chem.<br>
270, 7420; Shapiro and Dinarello, 1995, Proc. Natl. Acad.<br>
Sex. USA 92, 12230). In contrast, ERKs are activated by<br>
mitogens and growth factors (Bokemeyer et al. . 1996,<br>
Kidney Int. 49, 1187) .<br>
ERK2 is a widely distributed protein kinase<br>
that achieves maximum activity when both Thrl83 and<br>
Tyrl8 5 are phosphorylated by the upstream MAP kinase<br>
kinase, MEK1 (Anderson et al., 1990, Nature 343, 651;<br>
Crews et al., 1992, Science 258, 478). Upon activation,<br>
ERK2 phosphorylates many regulatory proteins, including<br>
the protein kinases Rsk90 (Bjorbaek et al., 1995, J.<br>
Biol. Chem. 270, 18848) and MAPKAP2 (Rouse et al., 1994,<br>
Cell 78, 1027), and transcription factors such as ATF2<br>
(Raingeaud et al. , 1996, Mol. Cell Biol. 16, 1247), Elk-1<br>
(Raingeaud et al. 1996), c-Fos (Chen et al., 1993 Proc.<br>
Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90, 10952), and c-Myc (Oliver et<br>
al. , 1995, Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 210, 162). ERK2 is<br>
also a downstream target of the Ras/Raf dependent<br>
pathways (Moodie et al., 1993, Science 2 60, 1658) and may<br>
help relay the signals from these potentially oncogenic<br>
proteins. ERK2 has been shown to play a role in the<br>
negative growth control of breast cancer cells (Frey and<br>
Mulder, 1997, Cancer Res. 57, 628) and hyperexpression of<br>
ERK2 in human breast cancer has been reported (Sivaraman<br>
et al., 1997, J Clin. Invest. 99, 1478). Activated ERK2<br>
has also been implicated in the proliferation of<br>
endothelin-stimulated airway smooth muscle cells,<br>
suggesting a role for this kinase in asthma (Whelchel et<br>
al., 1997, Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 16, 589).<br>
Aurora-2 is a serine/threonine protein kinase<br>
that has been implicated in human cancer, such as colon,<br>
breast and other solid tumors. This kinase is believed<br>
to be involved in protein phosphorylation events that<br>
regulate the cell cycle. Specifically, Aurora-2 may play<br>
a role in controlling the accurate segregation of<br>
chromosomes during mitosis. Misregulation of the cell<br>
cycle can lead to cellular proliferation and other<br>
abnormalities. In human colon cancer tissue, the aurora-<br>
2 protein has been found to be overexpressed. See<br>
Bischoff et al., EMBO J. , 1998, 17, 3052-3065; Schumacher<br>
et al., J. Cell Biol., 1998, 143, 1635-1646; Kimura et<br>
al., J. Biol. Chem., 1997, 272, 13766-13771.<br>
Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) is a<br>
serine/threonine protein kinase comprised of a and p<br>
isoforms that are each encoded by distinct genes [Coghlan<br>
et al., Chemistry &amp; Biology, 7, 793-803 (2000); Kim and<br>
Kimmel, Curr. Opinion Genetics Dev. , 10, 508-514 (2000)].<br>
GSK-3 has been implicated in various diseases including<br>
diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, CNS disorders such as<br>
manic depressive disorder and neurodegenerative diseases,<br>
and cardiomyocete hypertrophy [WO 99/65897; WO 00/38675;<br>
and Hag et al., J. Cell Biol. (2000) 151, 117]. These<br>
diseases may be caused by, or result in, the abnormal<br>
operation of certain cell signaling pathways in which<br>
GSK-3 plays a role. GSK-3 has been found to<br>
phosphorylate and modulate the activity of a number of<br>
regulatory proteins. These proteins include glycogen<br>
synthase which is the rate limiting enzyme necessary for<br>
glycogen synthesis, the microtubule associated protein<br>
Tau, the gene transcription factor b-catenin, the<br>
translation initiation factor elF2B, as well as ATP<br>
citrate lyase, axin, heat shock factor-1, c-Jun, c-Myc,<br>
c-Myb, CREB, and CEPBa. These diverse protein targets<br>
implicate GSK-3 in many aspects of cellular metabolism,<br>
proliferation, differentiation and development.<br>
In a GSK-3 mediated pathway that is relevant<br>
for the treatment of type II diabetes, insulin-induced<br>
signaling leads to cellular glucose uptake and glycogen<br>
synthesis. Along this pathway, GSK-3 is a negative<br>
regulator of the insulin-induced signal. Normally, the<br>
presence of insulin causes inhibition of GSK-3 mediated<br>
phosphorylation and deactivation of glycogen synthase.<br>
The inhibition of GSK-3 leads to increased glycogen<br>
synthesis and glucose uptake [Klein et al., PNAS, 93,<br>
8455-9 (1996); Cross et al., Biochem. J., 303, 21-26<br>
(1994); Cohen, Biochem. Soc. Trans., 21, 555-567 (1993);<br>
Massillon et al., Biochem J. 299, 123-128 (1994)].<br>
However, in a diabetic patient where the insulin response<br>
is impaired, glycogen synthesis and glucose uptake fail<br>
to increase despite the presence of relatively high blood<br>
levels of insulin. This leads to abnormally high blood<br>
levels of glucose with acute and long term effects that<br>
may ultimately result in cardiovascular disease, renal<br>
failure and blindness. In such patients, the normal<br>
insulin-induced inhibition of GSK-3 fails to occur. It<br>
has also been reported that in patients with type II<br>
diabetes, GSK-3 is overexpressed [WO 00/38675].<br>
Therapeutic inhibitors of GSK-3 therefore are considered<br>
to be useful for treating diabetic patients suffering<br>
from an impaired response to insulin.<br>
GSK-3 activity has also been associated with<br>
Alzheimer's disease. This disease is characterized by<br>
the well-known P-amyloid peptide and the formation of<br>
intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. The<br>
neurofibrillary tangles contain hyperphosphorylated Tau<br>
protein where Tau is phosphorylated on abnormal sites.<br>
GSK-3 has been shown to phosphorylate these abnormal<br>
sites in cell and animal models. Furthermore, inhibition<br>
of GSK-3 has been shown to prevent hyperphosphorylation<br>
of Tau in cells [Lovestone et al., Current Biology 4,<br>
1077-86 (1994); Brownlees et al., Neuroreport 8, 3251-55<br>
(1997)]. Therefore, it is believed that GSK-3 activity<br>
may promote generation of the neurofibrillary tangles and<br>
the progression of Alzheimer's disease.<br>
Another substrate of GSK-3 is (3-catenin which<br>
is degradated after phosphorylation by GSK-3. Reduced<br>
levels of ßcatenin have been reported in schizophrenic<br>
patients and have also been associated with other<br>
diseases related to increase in neuronal cell death<br>
[Zhong et al., Nature, 395, 698-702 (1998); Takashima et<br>
al., PNAS, 90, 7789-93 (1993); Pei et al., J.<br>
Neuropathol. Exp, 56, 70-78 (1997)].<br>
As a result of the biological importance of<br>
GSK-3, there is current interest in therapeutically<br>
effective GSK-3 inhbitors. Small molecules that inhibit<br>
GSK-3 have recently been reported [WO 99/65897 (Chiron)<br>
and WO 00/38675 (SmithKline Beecham)].<br>
Aryl substituted pyrroles are known in the<br>
literature. In particular, tri-aryl pyrroles (US<br>
5,837,719) have been described as having glucagon<br>
antagonist activity. 1,5-Diarylpyrazoles have been<br>
described as p38 inhibitors (WO 9958523).<br>
There is a high unmet medical need to develop<br>
new therapeutic treatments that are useful in treating<br>
the various conditions associated with ERK2 activation.<br>
For many of these conditions the currently available<br>
treatment options are inadequate.<br>
Accordingly, there is great interest in new and<br>
effective inhibitors of protein kinase, including ERK2<br>
inhibitors, that are useful in treating various<br>
conditions associated with protein kinase activation.<br>

As used herein, the following definitions shall<br>
apply unless otherwise indicated. The phrase "optionally<br>
substituted" is used interchangeably with the phrase<br>
"substituted or unsubstituted" or with the term<br>
"(un)substituted." Unless otherwise indicated, an<br>
optionally substituted group may have a substituent at<br>
each substitutable position of the group, and each<br>

that is completely saturated or that contains one or more<br>
units of unsaturation, but which is not aromatic (also<br>
referred to herein as "carbocycle" or "cycloalkyl"), that<br>
has a single point of attachment to the rest of the<br>
molecule wherein any individual ring in said bicyclic<br>
ring system has 3-7 members. For example, suitable<br>
aliphatic groups include, but are not limited to, linear<br>

of a larger moiety shall include both straight and<br>
branched chains containing two to twelve carbon atoms.<br>
The terms "haloalkyl", "haloalkenyl" and<br>
"haloalkoxy" means alkyl, alkenyl or alkoxy, as the case<br>
may be, substituted with one or more halogen atoms. The<br>

or sulfur and includes any oxidized form of nitrogen and<br>
sulfur, and the quaternized form of any basic nitrogen.<br>
Also the term "nitrogen" includes a substitutable<br>

tricyclic ring systems having a total of five to fourteen<br>
ring members, wherein at least one ring in the system is<br>
aromatic and wherein each ring in the system contains 3<br>
to 7 ring members. The term "aryl" may be used<br>

or the term "heteroaromatic".<br>
An aryl (including aralkyl, aralkoxy,<br>
aryloxyalkyl and the like) or heteroaryl (including<br>
heteroaralkyl and heteroarylalkoxy and the like) group<br>
may contain one or more substituents. Suitable<br>
substituents on the unsaturated carbon atom of an aryl,<br>

-NR°NR°C(O)N(R°)2, -NR°NR°CO2R°/ -C(O)C(O)R°, -C (0) CH2C (0) R°,<br>
-CO2R°, -C(O)R°, -C(O)N(R°)2, -OC (O) N (R°) 2, -S(O)2R°,<br>
-SO2N(R°)2, -S(O)R°, -NR°SO2N(R°)2/ -NR°SO2R0, -C (=S) N (R°) 2,<br>
-C(=NH) -N(R°)2, -(CH2)yNHC(O)R°, or<br>

Substituents on the aliphatic group of R° are selected<br>
from NH2, NH(C1.4 aliphatic), N(C1-4 aliphatic)2, halogen,<br>
C1-4 aliphatic, OH, 0- (C1-4 aliphatic), N02, CN, C02H,<br>
CO2(C1-4 aliphatic), -O(halo C1-4 aliphatic), or halo C1-4<br>
aliphatic.<br>
An aliphatic group or a non-aromatic<br>
heterocyclic ring may contain one or more substituents.<br>
Suitable substituents on the saturated carbon of an<br>
aliphatic group or of a non-aromatic heterocyclic ring<br>
are selected from those listed above for the unsaturated<br>
carbon of an aryl or heteroaryl group and the following:<br>
=0, =S, =NNHR*, =NN(R*)2, =N-, =NNHC (o) R*, =NNHC02 (alkyl),<br>
=NNHS02(alkyl), or =NR*, where each.R* is independently<br>
selected from hydrogen or an optionally substituted C1-6<br>
aliphatic. Substituents on the aliphatic group of R* are<br>
selected from NH2, NH(d-4 aliphatic), N(C1.4 aliphatic)2,<br>
halogen, C1.4 aliphatic, OH, O- (C1.4 aliphatic) , No2, CN,<br>

optionally substituted phenyl (Ph), optionally<br>
substituted -O(Ph), optionally substituted -CH2(Ph),<br>
optionally substituted -CH2CH2(Ph), or an unsubstituted 5-<br>

The term "alkylidene chain" refers to an<br>
optionally substituted, straight or branched carbon chain<br>
that may be fully saturated or have one or more units of<br>
unsaturation. The optional substituents are as described<br>
above for an aliphatic group.<br>
The term "spacer group" refers to a group that<br>
separates and orients other parts of the molecule<br>
attached thereto, such that the compound favorably<br>
interacts with functional groups in the active site of an<br>
enzyme. As used herein, the spacer group separates and<br>
orients ring A and QR2 within the active site such that<br>
they may form favorable interactions with functional<br>
groups which exist within the active site of the ERK2<br>
enzyme. When the spacer group is a 5-membered<br>
heteroaromatic ring, ring A and QR2 are attached at non-<br>
adjacent positions "B" and "C", and the 5-membered ring<br>
is attached to ring A at point "D" and to QR2 at point "E"<br>
as illustrated below.<br>
Preferably, the distance between "D" and "C" is 3.7A, the<br>
distance between "D" and "E" is 5.0A, the distance<br>
between "B" and "C" is 2.2A, and the distance between "B"<br>
and "E" is 3 . 5A , wherein each of the above described<br>
distances is plus/minus 0.2 A.<br>
The spacer group itself may also form<br>
additional interactions within the active site to further<br>
enhance inhibitory activity of the compounds. For<br>
example, when Sp is a pyrrole the pyrrole-NH may form an<br>
additional hydrogen bond within the active site of the<br>
ERK2 enzyme.<br>
The term "linker group" means an organic moiety<br>
that connects two parts of a compound. Linkers are<br>
typically comprised of an atom such as oxygen or sulfur,<br>
a unit such as -NH-, -CH2-, -CO-, or a chain of atoms,<br>
such as an alkylidene chain. The molecular mass of a<br>
linker is typically in the range of about 14 to 200.<br>
Examples of linkers include a saturated or unsaturated<br>
C1-6 alkylidene chain which is optionally substituted, and<br>
wherein up to two saturated carbons of the chain are<br>
optionally replaced by -C(0)-, -C(O)C(O)-, -CONR7-,<br>
-C0NR7NR7-, -C02-, -OC(O)-, -NR7CO2-, -O-, -NR7CONR7- ,<br>
-OC(O)NR7-, -NR7NR7-, -NR7C0-, -S-, -SO-, -SO2-, -NR7-,<br>
-SO2NR7-, or -NR7SO2-.<br>
As used herein, linker group Q connects Sp with<br>
R2. Q may also form additional interactions within the<br>
ERK2 binding site to further enhance the inhibitory<br>
activity of the compound. When Q is a carbonyl-<br>
containing moeity such as -C(O)-, -CO2-, -OC(O)-,<br>
-C(O)C(O)-, -CONH-, -CO2NH-, -CONHNH-, -NHCO-, -OC(O)NH-,<br>
or -NHCO2-, or a sulfonyl-containing moeity such as -SO2-,<br>
-SO2NH-, or -NHSO2-, the carbonyl or sulf onyl oxygen forms<br>
a hydrogen-bond with lysine 54 in the ERK2 binding site.<br>
When Q is an NH-containing moeity such as -CH2NH- or<br>
-NHNH-, the NH-group forms a hydrogen-bond with aspartic<br>
acid residue 167 in the ERK2 binding site. When Q is a<br>
hydrophobic group such as an alkyl chain, -0-, or -S-, Q<br>
forms additional hydrophobic interactions within the ERK2<br>
binding site.<br>
R2 forms hydrophobic interactions within the<br>
binding site of ERK2, especially with the side-chain<br>
carbons of lysine 54 and aspartic acid 167. R2 may also<br>
form hydrophobic interactions with the glycine-rich loop<br>
which is made up of amino-acid residues 33-38. When R2 is<br>
substituted, the substituents may form further<br>
interactions within the binding site to enhance the<br>
inhibitory activity of the compound. For example, when a<br>
substituent on R2 is a hydrogen-bond donor or a hydrogen-<br>
bond acceptor, said substituent forms a hydrogen bond<br>
with enzyme-bound water molecules that exist in the<br>
binding site.<br>
As used herein, linker group T, when present,<br>
connects Sp with R1. T may also form additional<br>
interactions within the ERK2 binding site to further<br>
enhance the inhibitory activity of the compound. When T<br>
is carbonyl-containing such as -CO-, -C02-, -0C0-, -COCO-,<br>
-CONH-, -CO2NH-, -CONHNH-, -NHCO-, or -NHCO2-, or<br>
sulfonyl-containing such as -SO2-, -S02NH-, or -NHSO2-,<br>
the carbonyl or sulfonyl oxygen forms a hydrogen-bond<br>
with the NH of glutamine 105 in the ERK2 binding site.<br>
When T is NH-containing such as -CH2NH- or -NHNH-, the NH-<br>
group forms a hydrogen-bond with the carbonyl of<br>
glutamine 105. When T is a hydrophobic group such as an<br>
alkyl chain, -0-, or -S-, T forms additional hydrophobic<br>
interactions with the side-chain carbons of glutamine 105<br>
as well as isoleucine 84.<br>

inhibits the kinase activity where compared to the<br>
activity of the enzyme in the absence of an inhibitor.<br>
Any method may be used to determine inhibition, such as,<br>
for example, the Biological Testing Examples described<br>
below.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers that ir.ay<br>
be used in these pharmaceutical compositions include, but<br>
are not limited to, ion exchangers, alumina, aluminum<br>
stearate, lecithin, serum proteins, such as human serum<br>
albumin, buffer substances such as phosphates, glycine,<br>

intraperitoneally or intravenously.<br>
Sterile injectable forms of the compositions of<br>
this invention may be aqueous or oleaginous suspension.<br>
These suspensions may be formulated according to<br>
techniques"known in the art using suitable dispersing or<br>
wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile<br>
injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable<br>
solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally-<br>
acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a solution<br>
in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and<br>
solvents that may be employed are water. Ringer's<br>
solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In<br>
addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed<br>
as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose, any<br>
bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono-<br>
or di-glycerides. Fatty acids, such as oleic acid and<br>
its glyceride derivatives are useful in the preparation<br>
of injectables, as are natural pharmaceutically-<br>
acceptable oils, such as olive oil or castor oil,<br>
especially in their polyoxyethylated versions. These oil<br>
solutions or suspensions may also contain a long-chain<br>
alcohol diluent or dispersant, such as carboxymethyl<br>
cellulose or similar dispersing agents which are commonly<br>
used in the formulation of pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
dosage forms including emulsions and suspensions. Other<br>
commonly used surfactants, such as Tweens, Spans and<br>
other emulsifying agents or bioavailability enhancers<br>
which are commonly used in the manufacture of<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable solid, liquid, or other<br>
dosage forms may also be used for the purposes of<br>
formulation.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of this<br>
invention may be orally administered in any orally<br>
acceptable dosage form including, but not limited to,<br>
capsules, tablets, aqueous suspensions or solutions. In<br>
the case of tablets for oral use, carriers commonly used<br>
include lactose and corn starch. Lubricating agents,<br>
such as magnesium stearate, are also typically added.<br>
For oral administration in a capsule form, useful<br>
diluents include lactose and dried cornstarch. When<br>
aqueous suspensions are required for oral use, the active<br>
ingredient is combined with emulsifying and suspending<br>
agents. If desired, certain sweetening, flavoring or<br>
coloring agents may also be added.<br>
Alternatively, the pharmaceutical compositions<br>
of this invention may be administered in the form of<br>
suppositories for rectal administration. These can be<br>
prepared by mixing the agent with a suitable non-<br>
irritating excipient which is solid at room temperature<br>
but liquid at rectal temperature and therefore will melt<br>
in the rectum to release the drug. Such materials<br>
include cocoa butter, beeswax and polyethylene glycols.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of this<br>
invention may also be administered topically, especially<br>
when the target of treatment includes areas or organs<br>
readily accessible by topical application, including<br>
diseases of the eye, the skin, or the lower intestinal<br>
tract. Suitable topical formulations are readily<br>
prepared for each of these areas or organs.<br>

carriers. Suitable carriers include, but are not limited<br>
to, mineral oil, sorbitan monostearate, polysorbate 60,<br>
cetyl esters wax, cetearyl alcohol, 2-octyldodecanol,<br>
benzyl alcohol and water.<br>
For ophthalmic use, the pharmaceutical<br>
compositions may be formulated as micronized suspensions<br>
in isotonic, pH adjusted sterile saline, or, preferably,<br>
as solutions in isotonic, pH adjusted sterile saline,<br>
either with or without a preservative such as<br>
benzylalkonium chloride. Alternatively, for ophthalmic<br>
uses, the pharmaceutical compositions may be formulated<br>
in an ointment such as petrolatum.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of this<br>
invention may also be administered by nasal aerosol or<br>
inhalation. Such compositions are prepared according to<br>
techniques well-known in the art of pharmaceutical<br>
formulation and may be prepared as solutions in saline,<br>
employing benzyl alcohol or other suitable preservatives,<br>
absorption promoters to enhance bioavailability,<br>
fluorocarbons, and/or other conventional solubilizing or<br>
dispersing agents.<br>
In addition to the compounds of this invention,<br>

A "pharmaceutically acceptable derivative "<br>
means any pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester, salt<br>
of an ester or other derivative of a compound of this<br>
invention which, upon administration to a recipient, is<br>
capable of providing, either directly or indirectly, a<br>
compound of this invention or an inhibitorily active<br>
metabolite or residue thereof. Particularly favored<br>
derivatives are those that increase the bioavailability<br>
of the compounds of this invention when such compounds<br>
are administered to a patient (e.g., by allowing an<br>
orally administered compound to be more readily absorbed<br>
into the blood) or which enhance delivery of the parent<br>
compound to a biological compartment (e.g., the brain or<br>
lymphatic system) relative to the parent species.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the<br>
compounds of this invention include those derived from<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic and organic acids<br>
and bases. Examples of suitable acid salts include<br>
acetate, adipate, alginate, aspartate, benzoate,<br>
benzenesulfonate, bisulfate, butyrate, citrate,<br>
camphorate, camphorsulfonate, cyclopentanepropionate,<br>
digluconate, dodecylsulfate, ethanesulfonate, formate,<br>

naphthalenesulfonate, nicotinate, nitrate, oxalate,<br>
palmoate, pectinate, persulfate, 3-phenylpropionate,<br>
phosphate, picrate, pivalate, propionate, salicylate,<br>
succinate, sulfate, tartrate, thiocyanate, tosylate and<br>
undecanoate. Other acids, such as oxalic, while not in<br>
themselves pharmaceutically acceptable, may be employed<br>
in the preparation of salts useful as intermediates in<br>
obtaining the compounds of the invention and their<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts.<br>
Salts derived from appropriate bases include<br>
alkali metal (e.g., sodium and potassium), alkaline earth<br>
metal (e.g., magnesium), ammonium and N+ (C1.4 alkyl)4<br>
salts. This invention also envisions the quaternization<br>
of any basic nitrogen-containing groups of the compounds<br>
disclosed herein. Water or oil-soluble or dispersible<br>
products may be obtained by such quaternization.<br>
The amount of the protein kinase inhibitor that<br>
may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a<br>
single dosage form will vary depending upon the patient<br>
treated and the particular mode of administration.<br>
Preferably, the compositions should be formulated so that<br>
a dosage of between 0.01 - 100 mg/kg body weight/day of<br>
the inhibitor can be administered to a patient receiving<br>
these compositions.<br>
It should also be understood that a specific<br>
dosage and treatment regimen for any particular patient<br>
will depend upon a variety of factors, including the<br>
activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body<br>
weight, general health, sex, diet, time of<br>
administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, and<br>
the judgment of the treating physician and the severity<br>
of the particular disease being treated. The amount of<br>
the inhibitor will also depend upon the particular<br>
compound in the composition.<br>
The kinase inhibitors of this invention or<br>
pharmaceutical compositions thereof may also be<br>
incorporated into compositions for coating an implantable<br>
medical device, such as prostheses, artificial valves,,<br>
vascular grafts, stents and catheters. Vascular stents,<br>
for example, have been used to overcome restenosis (re-<br>
narrowing of the vessel wall after injury). However,<br>
patients using stents or other implantable devices risk<br>
clot formation or platelet activation. These unwanted<br>
effects may be prevented or mitigated by pre-coating the<br>
device with a pharmaceutically acceptable composition<br>
comprising a kinase inhibitor. Suitable coatings and the<br>
general preparation of coated implantable devices are<br>
described in US Patents 6,099,562; 5,886,026; and<br>
5,304,121. The coatings are typically biocompatible<br>
polymeric materials such as a hydrogel polymer,<br>
polymethyldisiloxane, polycaprolactone, polyethylene<br>
glycol, polylactic acid, ethylene vinyl acetate, and<br>
mixtures thereof. The coatings may optionally be further<br>
covered by a suitable topcoat of fluorosilicone,<br>
polysaccarides, polyethylene glycol, phospholipids or<br>
combinations thereof to impart controlled release<br>
characteristics in the composition. Implantable devices<br>
coated with a kinase inhibitor of this invention are<br>
another embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Depending upon the particular protein kinase-<br>
mediated condition to be treated or prevented, additional<br>
therapeutic agents, which are normally administered to<br>
treat or prevent that condition, may be administered<br>
together with the inhibitors of this invention. For<br>
example, in the treatment of cancer other<br>
chemotherapeutic agents or other anti-proliferative<br>
agents may be combined with the protein kinase inhibitors<br>
of this invention to treat cancer. These agents include,<br>
without limitation, adriamycin, dexamethasone,<br>
vincristine, cyclophosphamide, fluorouracil, topotecan,<br>
taxol, interferons, and platinum derivatives.<br>
Other examples of agents the inhibitors of this<br>
invention may also be combined with include, without<br>
limitation, agents for treating diabetes such as insulin<br>
or insulin analogues, in injectable or inhalation form,<br>
glitazones, alpha glucosidase inhibitors, biguanides,<br>
insulin sensitizers, and sulfonyl ureas; anti-<br>
inflammatory agents such as corticosteroids, TNF<br>
blockers, IL-1 RA, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, and<br>
sulfasalazine; immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive<br>
agents such as cyclosporin, tacrolimus, rapamycin,<br>
mycophenolate mofetil, interferons, corticosteroids,<br>
cyclophophamide, azathioprine, and sulfasalazine;<br>
neurotrophic factors such as acetylcholinesterase<br>
inhibitors, MAO inhibitors, interferons, anti-<br>
convulsants, ion channel blockers, riluzole, and anti-<br>
Parkinsonian agents; agents for treating cardiovascular<br>
disease such as beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, diuretics,<br>
nitrates, calcium channel blockers, and statins; agents<br>
for treating liver disease such as corticosteroids,<br>
cholestyramine, interferons, and anti-viral agents;<br>
agents for treating blood disorders such as<br>
corticosteroids, anti-leukemic agents, and growth<br>
factors; and agents for treating immunodeficiency<br>
disorders such as gamma globulin.<br>
Those additional agents may be administered<br>
separately from the protein kinase inhibitor-containing<br>
composition, as part of a multiple dosage regimen.<br>
Alternatively, those agents may be part of a single<br>
dosage form, mixed together with the protein kinase<br>
inhibitor of this invention in a single composition.<br>
Compounds of this invention may exist in<br>
alternative tautomeric forms. Unless otherwise<br>
indicated, the representation of either tautomer is meant<br>
to include the other.<br>

The present compounds may be prepared in<br>
general by methods known to those skilled in the art for<br>
analogous compounds, as illustrated by the general<br>
Schemes I through XII and the synthetic examples shown<br>
below.<br>
Reagents and conditions: (a) TmR1CH2COCl, A1C13/ CH2C12, 2<br>
hours, RT; (b) DMF, 24 hrs, room temperature; (c) (Me2N)2-<br>
CHOt-Bu, THF, 24 hrs, room temperature; (d) guanidine,<br>
EtOH, 12 hours, reflux; (e) thiourea, EtOH, K2CO3, 12 hrs<br>
reflux; (f) m-CPBA, EtOH; (g) UnR3-NH2, DMSO, 130"C.<br>
Scheme I above shows a general synthetic route<br>
that is used for preparing the pyrrol-3-yl compounds of<br>
formula III-a of this invention when R2 is an optionally<br>
substituted phenyl group or aliphatic group. In step<br>
(a), an optionally substituted acid chloride is combined<br>
with compound 1, dichloromethane, and aluminum<br>
trichloride to form compound 2. In cases where benzoyl<br>
acid chlorides are used, a wide variety of substituents<br>
on the phenyl ring are amenable to this reaction.<br>
Aliphatic acid chlorides are also used in many cases.<br>
Examples of suitable R2 groups include, but are not<br>
limited to, those set forth in Table 1 above.<br>
The formation of amide 4 is achieved by-<br>
treating compound 2 with an amine 3 in DMF. When atnine 3<br>
5 is a primary amine, the reaction proceeds at ambient<br>
temperature. When amine 3_ is a. secondary amine, the<br>
reaction is heated at 50°C to achieve complete reaction<br>
and afford amide 4.<br>
The formation of enamine 5 at step (c) is<br>
) achieved by treating amide 4 with (Me2N)2-CHOt-Bu at<br>
ambient temperature. Alternatively, the reaction to form<br>
enamine 5 at step (c) is also achieved by using<br>
dimethylformamide-dimethylacetal (DMF-DMA). The reaction<br>
using DMF-DMA typically requires elevated temperature to<br>
afford enamine 5 whereas using (Me2N)2-OtBu has the<br>
advantage of proceeding at ambient temperature to afford<br>
the enamine 5 in higher purity.<br>
The formation of the pyrimidine compound 6 at<br>
step (d) is achieved by the treatment of enamine 5 with<br>
guanidine at elevated temperature. Alternatively, use of<br>
a substituted guanidine results in an amino substituent<br>
as is illustrated by J3.<br>
As an alternative method, in step (e)<br>
intermediate _5 may be cyclized with S-methyl thiourea to<br>
form the 2-thiomethylpyrimidine 7 which may in turn be<br>
oxidized with m-CPBA to the sulfone. The sulfonyl group<br>
may be subsequently displaced by an amine to generate the<br>
substituted aminopyrimidine 8.<br>
The compounds of formula III-a synthesized by<br>
this method, as exemplified in Table 1, were isolated by<br>

BIOLOGICAL TESTING<br>
The activity of the present compounds as<br>
protein kinase inhibitors may be assayed in vitro, in<br>
vivo or in a cell line. In vitro assays include assays<br>
that determine inhibition of either the phosphorylatiori<br>
activity or ATPase activity of the activated protein<br>
kinase. Alternate in vitro assays guantitate the ability<br>
of the inhibitor to bind to the protein kinase.<br>
Inhibitor binding may be measured by radiolabelling the<br>
inhibitor prior to binding, isolating the<br>
inhibitor/protein kinase complex and determining the<br>
amount of radiolabel bound. Alternatively, inhibitor<br>
binding may be determined by running a competition<br>
experiment where new inhibitors are incubated with the<br>
protein kinase bound to known radioligands. The details<br>
of the conditions used for performing these assays are<br>
set forth in Examples 3 0 through 37.<br>

The compounds were assayed as inhibitors of<br>
full length bovine thymus Lck kinase (from Upstate<br>
Biotechnology, cat. no. 14-106) expressed and purified<br>
from baculo viral cells. Lck kinase activity was<br>
monitored by following the incorporation of 33P from ATP<br>
into the tyrosine of a random poly Glu-Tyr polymer<br>
substrate of composition, Glu.-Tyr = 4:1 (Sigma, cat. no.<br>
ß0275). The following were the final concentrations of<br>
the assay components: 0.025 M HEPES, pH 7.6, 10 mM MgCl2,<br>
2 mM DTT, 0.25 mg/ml BSA, 10 uM ATP (1-2 uCi 33P-ATP per<br>
reaction), 5 mg/ml poly Glu-Tyr, and 1-2 units of<br>
recombinant human Src kinase. In a typical assay, all<br>
the reaction components with the exception of ATP were<br>
pre-mixed and aliquoted into assay plate wells.<br>
Inhibitors dissolved in DMSO were added to the wells to<br>
give a final DMSO concentration of 2.5%. The assay plate<br>
was incubated at 30 C for 10 min before initiating the<br>
reaction with 33P-ATP. After 20 min of reaction, the<br>
reactions were quenched with 150 ul of 10%<br>
trichloroacetic acid (TCA) containing 20 mM Na3PO4. The<br>
quenched samples were then transferred to a 96-well<br>
filter plate (Whatman, UNI-Filter GF/F Glass Fiber<br>
Filter, cat no. 7700-3310) installed on a filter plate<br>
vacuum manifold. Filter plates were washed four times<br>

incorporated was plotted as a function of the inhibitor<br>
concentration. The data was fitted to a competitive<br>
inhibition kinetics model to get the Ki for the compound.<br>
Lck Inhibition Assay B: Spectrophotometric Assay<br>
The ADP produced from ATP by the human<br>
recombinant Lck kinase-catalyzed phosphorylation of poly<br>
Glu-Tyr substrate was quanitified using a coupled enzyme<br>
assay (Fox et al (1998)' Protein Sci 7, 2249) . In this<br>
assay one molecule of NADH is oxidised to NAD for every<br>
molecule of ADP produced in the kinase reaction. The<br>
disappearance of NADH can be conveniently followed at 340<br>
nm.<br>
The following were the final concentrations of<br>
the assay components: 0.025 M HEPES, pH 7.6, 10 mM MgCl2,<br>
2 mM DTT, 5 mg/ml poly Glu-Tyr, and 5 0 nM of recombinant<br>
human Lck kinase. Final concentrations of the components<br>
of the coupled enzyme system were 2.5 mM<br>
phosphoenolpyruvate, 2 00 uM NADH, 3 0 ug/ml pyruvate<br>
kinase and 10 ug/ml lactate dehydrogenase.<br>
In a typical assay, all the reaction components<br>
with the exception of ATP were pre-mixed and aliquoted<br>
into assay plate wells. Inhibitors dissolved in DMSO<br>
were added to the wells to give a final DMSO<br>
concentration of 2.5%. The assay plate was incubated at<br>
30 °C for 10 min before initiating the reaction with 150<br>
uM ATP. The absorbance change at 34 0 nm with time, the<br>
rate of the reaction, was monitored on a molecular<br>
devices plate reader. The data of rate as a function of<br>
the inhibitor concentration was fitted to competitive<br>
inhibition kinetics model to get the Ki for the compound.<br>

exception of AKT3, DTT, and the test compound of<br>
interest. 56 ul of the stock solution was placed in a<br>
384 well plate followed by addition of 1 ul of 2 mM DMSO<br>
stock containing the test compound (final compound<br>
concentration 30 uM). The plate was preincubated for<br>
about 10 minutes at 30°C and the reaction initiated by<br>
addition of 10 µl of enzyme (final concentration 45 nM)<br>
and 1 mM DTT. Rates of reaction were obtained using a<br>
