				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a composition for synergistically enhancing the efficacy of an antimicrobial agent.<br>
It is known that infection is spread via skin contact through the transmission of pathogenic microorganisms. Hitherto, in order to reduce the presence of such organisms it has been known to scrub the skin with a solution containing a surfactant followed by application of an antiseptic.<br>
In recent years it has been suggested that it would be desirable to combine the washing and disinfectant actions in a single operation by providing a composition comprising both an antimicrobial agent and a surfactant. It has been found however that many antimicrobial agents such as chlorhexidine [N,N'-bis(4-chlorphenyl)-3,12-diimino 2,4,11,13-tetraazatetradecanediimidamide] digluconate and other chlorhexidine salts are incompatible with anionic surfactants, and are reduced in their antimicrobial activity by nonionic surfactants, thus requiring addition of more antimicrobial agent in order to retain sufficient biocidal activity at the amount of surfactant required for satisfactory foam formation.<br>
In particular, US 3,855,140 assigned to Imperial Chemical Industries describes a skin cleansing composition comprising a soluble salt of chlorhexidine in combination with a polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene block copolymer. In order to obtain sufficient sudsing of the polymer it is necessary to use high proportions of the surfactant in amounts of order of 20-25%. High amounts of chlorhexidine are consequently required to maintain the desired antimicrobial activity. Such high amounts are undesirable as it is known that surfactants may affect the skin adversely by defatting, and causing in combination with biocides such as chlorhexidine, irritation to the skin. Further the ingredients of the composition can be costly.<br><br>
It would be desirable therefore to provide a composition in which the amount of antimicrobial agent and surfactant is reduced whilst maintaining sufficient antimicrobial activity and sudsing ability.<br>
In this regard, in order to provide such a composition, WO 95/09605 teaches one to combine a phenolic disinfectant with an alkyIpolyglucoside surfactant. As indicated in that patent however, such compositions although showing good biocidal activity against most microorganisms, are incapable of disinfecting surfaces contaminated by the microorganism Pseudomonas aeruginosa to which the compositions are inactive.<br>
It is an object of the invention to substantially ameliorate the disadvantages of the prior art.<br>
According to the present invention, there is provided a composition for synergistically enhancing the efficacy of an antimicrobial agent, said system including,<br>
(a)	up to 6% alcohol polysaccharide surfactant of the kind as herein<br>
described;<br>
(b)	up  to   70%  of at  least  one   alkyl  alcohol  of the   kind   as   herein<br>
described;<br>
(c)	up to 3% of at least one aryl alcohol of the kind as herein described;<br>
and<br>
(d)	wherein the balance to 100% is water.<br>
The composition of the present invention is neither a mere admixture nor a product of chemical but a synergistic mixture exhibiting unexpected and surprising properties.<br>
According to a second aspect of the invention there is provided a method of decontaminating surfaces contaminated with bacteria including the Pseudomonas microorganism, which method comprises contacting the surface with the disinfectant cleansing composition of the first aspect.<br>
Typically the cleansing composition comprises an inert carrier, and optionally other additives.<br>
The alkylpolysaccharide surfactants are also known in the art as alkylpolyglucosides, however, for the purposes of the following discussion, the surfactant will be termed an alkylpolysaccharide.<br>
Preferably, the content of the surfactant present in the composition does not exceed 6% w/v.<br>
Preferably the alkylpolysaccharide is an alkylpolysaccharide of the formula:<br><br><br><br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
wherein n is an integer between 5 and 19, and<br>
m is an integer between 1 and 3.<br>
In the above formula the surfactant alkyl polysaccharide shown contains glucose units, however the invention is not limited thereto and other sugar units can be substituted for one or more of the glucose units. Other sugar units which might be<br>
/<br>
included in the alkylpolysaccharide include maltose, arabinose, xylose, mannose, galactose, gulose, idose, talose, allose, altrose, sucrose, fructose, sorbose, levulose, lactose, allulose, tagatose, alloheprulose, sedoheptulose, glucoheptulose, mannoheptulose, guloheptulose, idoheptulose, galactoheptulose, taloheptulose and derivatives thereof.<br>
Suitable antimicrobial agents include chlorhexidine and its salts; dichlorophene, other chlorophenol derivatives such as p-chloro-m-xylenol, chlorophene and o-phenylphenol, 2,4,4-trichloro-2-hydroxy-diphenylether (triclosan); octenidindihydrochloride (CH3 -(CH2)7-NHON-(CH2),0-NO-NH(CH2)7-CH2 or any other salt thereof and quaternary ammonium compounds.<br>
Suitable salts of chlorhexidine include the gluconate, isethionate, formate, acetate, glutamate, succinamate, monodiglycolate, dimethanesulfonate, lactate, diisobutyrate or the glucoheptonate salts.<br>
Preferably the antimicrobial agent has a water solubility of at least 0.001% w/v at ambient temperature.<br>
When the antimicrobial agent is chlorhexidine digluconate it is used in an amount preferably not exceeding 4.5% w/v. When the antimicrobial agent is 2,4,4-trichloro-2-hydroxydiphenylether (triclosan) it is used in an amount preferably not exceeding 3% w/v.<br><br>
The alkyl alcohol is preferably a lower alkyl alcohol (herein defined as an alcohol having less than 6 carbon atoms) such as ethanol, iso or n-propanol, most preferably the alkyl alcohol is isopropanol or n-propanol. The alcohol content preferably does not exceed 70% w/v. When the composition is in an aqueous carrier (for example for use in hand washing) the alcohol is desirably iso or n-propanol or a combination thereof and is preferably present in an amount of from 3 to 10% w/v, most preferably 4 to 8% w/v. When the composition is an alcoholic solution (for example for a rapid cleaning self-drying solution) the alkyl alcohol will be preferably be 55-75% w/v.<br>
The aryl alcohol is preferably a benzylalcohol, phenylethylalcohol,<br>
/<br>
phenoxyethanol, phenoxypropanol or a chlorinated derivative thereof. For application to skin, phenoxyethanol and phenoxypropanol are preferred. Preferably the aryl alcohol is present in an amount not exceeding 3% w/v.<br>
An inert carrier can be used - for example water or a lower alcohol such as ethanol.<br>
The composition may further comprise one or more of the following integers:<br>
(a)	a solubilising agent for example propylene glycol, a hydrotrope or<br>
mixtures thereof. Suitable hydrotropes include urea, cumene sulphonate, toluene<br>
sulfonate, xylenesulphonate and the ethanolamine salts of citric and other<br>
hydroxycarboxylic acids.<br>
(b)	a foaming agent such as an alkylaminooxide, alkylmono or<br>
diethanolamides. Examples of foaming agents are lauryl or cocodiethanolamide or<br>
monoethanolamide condensates or the lauryl or cetyl dimethylamineoxides.<br>
(c)	viscosity modifiers such as cellulose derivatives, guar resins and<br>
carbopol resins.<br>
(d)	preservatives such as imidazolidinyl, urea derivatives (Germabenes),<br>
methyl or propyl parabens (p-hydroxy benzoic esters).<br>
(e)	other conventional additives such as colouring agents, fragrances,<br>
antioxidants, emolients, moisturisers, stabilising agents and thickeners such as<br>
carboxymethylcellulose.<br><br>
(f)  optionally, additional surfactants including amphoteric surfactants, anionic surfactants and nonionic surfactants. Suitable additional surfactants include quaternary ammonium compounds or a small amount of a high foaming anionic surfactant such as laurylethoxysulfonate, sarcosinates, sodium laurylethersulphate. The additional ingredients are selected to avoid possible incompatibility with any of the other ingredients of the composition and especially with regard to the antimicrobial agents.<br>
The pH of the composition is typically adjusted to pH 5 to 7, most preferably 5.5 but is not limited to this pH. When chlorhexidine is used as the antimicrobial agent, a pH greater than 8 should be avoided to prevent precipitation of the<br>
t<br>
chlorhexidine free base. Most organic acids compatible with the composition, such as lactic, acetic, citric and gluconic acids, preferably gluconic acid, can be used to adjust the pH.<br>

Compositions according to the invention have the same or greater effectiveness with respect to biocidal activity and are less toxic, at much lower concentrations of the antimicrobial agent in comparison with conventional prior art compositions.<br>
In preferred embodiments, the use of an alkylpolysaccharide surfactant in amounts below 6% (w/v), the amount of triclosan can be successfully reduced from 1.0% to 0.5% (w/v) with substantially no loss in biocidal activity. Surprisingly the amount of chlorhexidine can be reduced 4% to 2% (w/v) whilst maintaining good biocidal activity and foaming properties.<br>
Further, by use of alkylpolysaccharides in amounts as low as 2% it is possible to obtain sufficient foaming skin cleansing properties not obtainable with other conventional surfactants. Further, the known interference with the antimicrobial properties of biocides with surfactants is considerably reduced.<br>
Further, by the inclusion of an alkyl and aryl alcohol combination, the compositions of the invention are effective against the pseudomonas microorganism.<br>
The invention is a significant and important improvement on the art as taught in US 3,855,140 as illustrated by the fact that, while the composition of US Patent 3,855,140 showed no activity against Pseudomonas, the compositions of the present<br>
invention are effective against Pseudomonas at concentrations containing as low as 0.49% triclosan.<br>
Compositions according to the invention are especially suitable for skin and hand disinfection, surface disinfection, impregnation of sponges, woven and non-woven textiles and the like.<br>
The composition of the invention is suitable for cleansing any object. The composition of the invention is particularly suitable for cleansing hands in clinical situations and before surgery but can also be used for cleansing inanimate objects such as surgical instruments.<br><br><br><br>
