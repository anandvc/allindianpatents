				<td>Process for the preparation of N-{4,5-bismethanesulfonyl-2-methyl-<br>
benzoyl)guanidine, hydrochloride<br>
The present invention relates to N-(4,5-bismethanesulfonyl-2-methyl-<br>
benzoyl)guanidine, hydrochloride hydrate, and to a process for the prepa-<br>
ration of N-(4,5-bismethanesulfonyl-2-methylbenzoyl)guanidine, hydro-<br>
chloride and the hydrochloride hydrate. N-(4,5-Bismethanesulfonyl-2-<br>
methylbenzoyl)guanidine, hydrochloride hydrate is an NHE-1 selective<br>
Na/H+ antiporter inhibitor.<br>
Sulfonylbenzoylguanidines are known and are described, for example, in<br>
EP 0 758 644 A1. These substances are inhibitors of the cellular Na+/H+<br>
antiporter, i.e. they are active ingredients which inhibit the Na+/H+<br>
exchange mechanism of the cells (Dusing et al., Med. Klin. 1992, 87, 367-<br>
384,) and are consequently good antiarrhythmic agents which are suitable,<br>
in particular, for the treatment of arrhythmia occurring as a consequence of<br>
oxygen deficiency.<br>
The substances exhibit a good cardioprotective action and are therefore<br>
particularly suitable for the treatment of acute myocardial infarction, infarc-<br>
tion prophylaxis, post-infarction treatment, chronic cardiac insufficiency and<br>
for the treatment of angina pectoris. They furthermore counter all pathologi-<br>
cal hypoxic and ischaemic damage, enabling the illnesses caused primarily<br>
or secondarily thereby to be treated. These active ingredients are likewise<br>
highly suitable for preventive applications.<br>
Owing to the protective action of these substances in pathological hypoxic<br>
or ischaemic situations, further possible applications arise therefrom in<br>
surgical interventions for protection of organs with temporarily reduced<br>
supply, in organ transplants for protection of the removed organs, in angio-<br>
plastc vascular or cardiac interventions, in ischemia of the nervous system,<br>
in the therapy of shock states and for the prevention of essential hyper-<br>
tonia.<br>
These compounds can furthermore also be employed as therapeutic<br>
agents in illnesses caused by cell proliferation, such as arteriosclerosis,<br>
diabetes and late complications of diabetes, tumour illnesses, fibrotic<br>
illnesses, in particular of the lungs, liver and kidneys, and organ hyper-<br>
trophia and hyperplasia. In addition, the compounds are suitable for diag-<br>
nostic use for the recognition of illnesses accompanied by increased<br>
activity of the Na+/H+ antiporter, for example in erythrocytes, thrombocytes<br>
or leukocytes.<br>
The compounds can therefore be used as medicament active ingredients in<br>
human and veterinary medicine. They can furthermore be used as interme-<br>
diates for the preparation of further medicament active ingredients.<br>
The invention had the object of finding a highly active compound having a<br>
very good oral absorption property.<br>
N-(4,5-Bismethanesulfonyl-2-methylbenzoyl)guanidine, hydrochloride<br>
hydrate has proven to be a highly suitable and highly active substance and<br>
is distinguished by a particularly good oral absorption property. N-(4,5-<br>
Bismethanesulfonyl-2-methylbenzoyl)guanidine, hydrochloride hydrate is<br>
therefore preferably administered in oral form.<br>
The absorption from the digestive tract after oral administration can be<br>
calculated by comparison of the concentrations of the administered active<br>
ingredient determined in the blood plasma after oral and intravenous<br>
administration (dose-standardised AUCpo/AUChIV) [AUC = area under the<br>
curve]. The rat exhibited an absorption rate of 98% (of the orally adminis-<br>
tered radioactively labelled substance). Bioavailabilities of the hydro-<br>
chloride hydrate of from 88% to 99% were found in dogs, and 75% and<br>
96% in 2 monkeys. Since the absorption rate is at least equal to or greater<br>
than the bioavailability determined, very good absorption has thus also<br>
been found in these animal species.<br>
The invention therefore relates to N-(4,5-bismethanesulfonyl-2-methyl-<br>
benzoyl)guanidine, hydrochloride hydrate. This invention is to be regarded<br>
as a selection invention toEP 0 758644.)<br>
Since this substance is very promising, its preparation is of very consider-<br>
able interest. The preparation of the free N-(4,5-bismethanesulfonyl-2-<br>
methylbenzoyl)guanidine base and its analogues has been described in<br>
EP 0 758 644 A1cited above.<br>
However, the known syntheses comprise a large number of individual<br>
steps, some of which have unsatisfactory yields and which also have<br>
environmentally polluting and hazardous reaction conditions, such as, for<br>
example, the reaction with methyl mercaptam or the oxidation of the thio-<br>
ether to give the sulfone.<br>
There is therefore great interest in finding an improved process for the<br>
preparation of N-(4,5-bismethanesulfonyl-2-methylbenzoyl)guanidine, its<br>
hydrochloride and hydrochloride hydrate.<br>
It was therefore likewise an object of the present invention to find a novel<br>
synthesis variant for the Na+/H+ antiporter which is shorter and also more<br>
effective compared with conventional methods.<br>
The invention relates to a process for the preparation of the benzoyl-<br>
guanidine derivative N-(4,5-bismethanesulfonyl-2-methylbenzoyl)-<br>
guanidine, hydrochloride of the formula I<br><br>
in which Me is methyl, and of the hydrochloride hydrate, which is<br>
characterised in that<br>
firstly, by reaction of the starting compound of the formula II<br><br><br>
in which<br>
Me is a methyl group, and Q is fluorine or chlorine,<br>
with a methanesulfinate in a nucleophilic substitution on the activated<br>
aromatic ring, the 4-methanesulfonyl group is introduced in a one-step<br>
reaction,<br>
then, in the second step, the compound of the formula III<br><br>
is converted into an acid chloride and reacted with guanidine to give<br>
N-(4,5-bismethanesulfonyl-2-methylbenzoyl)guanidine,<br>
and, in the third step, converted into the hydrochloride of the formula I <br>
and/or its hydrochloride hydrate by reaction in aqueous HCI.<br>
The starting compound of the formula II is prepared, for example, starting<br>
from 2-bromo-5-chlorotoluene by halogen-metal exchange and CO2 treat-<br>
ment to give 4-chloro-2-methylbenzoic acid followed by reaction of 4-<br><br>
chloro-2-methylbenzoic acid with chlorosulfonic acid, sodium sulfite and<br>
methyl iodide to give 4-chloro-2-methyl-5-methylsulfonylbenzoic acid or by<br>
reaction of 2-bromo-5-chlorotoluene with methanesulfonic acid and thionyl<br>
chloride in a Friedel-Crafts-like reaction in the presence of a Friedel-Crafts<br>
catalyst to give 4-chloro-2-methyl-4-methylsulfonylphenyl bromide followed<br>
by exchange of the bromine by a carboxyl group through a palladium-<br>
catalysed carbonylation reaction in an autoclave under superatmospheric<br>
pressure and at elevated temperature to give 4-chloro-2-methyl-5-methyl-<br>
sulfonylbenzoic acid. The reaction conditions selected are known from the<br>
literature (lit.: Houben-Weyl, Methoden der Organ. Chemie [Methods of<br>
Organic Chemistry], Georg-Thieme-Verlag, Stuttgart). However, it is also<br>
possible to use other processes which are known from the literature, but<br>
are not explained in greater detail here, for the preparation of compounds<br>
of the formula II.<br>
The term methanesulfinate denotes an alkali metal salt of methanesulfinic<br>
acid, in particular sodium methanesulfinate or potassium methanesulfinate,<br>
or an alkaline earth metal salt of methanesulfinic acid, in particular calcium<br>
methanesulfinate or magnesium methanesulfinate. Particular preference is<br>
given to the use of sodium methanesulfinate.<br>
The reaction of the compound of the formula II with a methanesulfinate,<br>
preferably sodium methanesulfinate, is carried out analogously to the<br>
method of A. Ulman et al., J. Org. Chem. 1989, 54, 4691-4692. The reac-<br>
tion is preferably carried out in a polar solvent and at reaction temperatures<br>
between 10 and 200°, preferably between 50 and 180°, particularly prefe-<br>
rably between 80 and 140°. Particularly preferred solvents are dimethyl<br>
sulfoxide (DMSO), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) or 1-methyl-2-pyrroli-<br>
done (NMP), very particularly preferably DMF or NMP. The methane-<br>
sulfinate is generally employed in excess. Under the said reaction condi-<br>
tions, exclusively the 4,5-bismethanesulfonyl-2-methylbenzoic acid of the<br>
formula III is formed.<br>
The guanidination of the compound of the formula HI in step 2 is not<br>
restricted to the acid chloride method, in which, for example, the compound<br>
of the formula III is reacted with thionyl chloride to give the acid chloride<br>
and further with guanidine. Jhere is a large number of methods known from<br>
the literature which enable the introduction of a guanidino group (for<br>
example in the standard works, such as Houben-Weyl, Methoden der<br>
organischen Chemie [Methods of Organic Chemistry], Georg-Thieme-<br>
Verlag, Stuttgart).<br>
For a guanidination in step 2, it is possible, inter alia, to react the free acid<br>
of the formula III with N-(benzyloxycarbonyl)guanidine, with the subsequent<br>
removal of the benzyloxycarbonyl protecting group (abbreviation = Z)<br>
liberating the guanidino group, as described in DE 199 19 349. For the pre-<br>
paration of benzyloxycarbonylguanidine, see M. Goodman et al., PCT Int.<br>
Appl. WO 9852917, 1998, K. Nowak, Rocz. Chem. 1969, 43, 231-232 or<br>
R. Krug and K. Nowak, Rocz. Chem. 1967,41, 1087-1091). The coupling is<br>
carried out with the aid of the known Mukaiyama method, cf.<br>
T. Mukaiyama, Angew. Chem., Int. Ed. Engl. 1979, 18, 707-721. The<br>
removal of the Z protecting group by catalytic hydrogenation can be carried<br>
out under the general conditions for this purpose (lit.: T.W. Greene,<br>
P.G.M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, 2nd Edn., Wiley,<br>
New York 1991 or P.J. Kocienski, Protecting Groups, 1st Edn., Georg<br>
Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart - New York, 1994).<br>
The base N-(4,5-bismethanesulfonyl-2-methylbenzoyl)guanidine prepared<br>
in accordance with the invention in steps 1 and 2 can also be converted<br>
into a salt by methods known from the literature by means of acids other<br>
than HCl.The acids which are suitable for this purpose are disclosed in<br>
EP 0 785 644.<br>
In the method described in EP 0 758 644 for the preparation of sulfonyl-<br>
benzoylguanidines, the sulfonyl group in the para-position to the carboxyl<br>
group is introduced via a nucleophilic halogen-sulfur alkyl exchange in<br>
addition to subsequent oxidation of the resultant thiophenol ether.<br>
The process now present in this invention introduces the sulfonyl group in<br>
the para-position in a single-stage reaction step. The number of synthesis<br>
steps and the preparation costs associated therewith are reduced. Further-<br>
more, the reaction with methyl mercaptam and the oxidation, which make<br>
particular technical safety measures necessary on a large industrial scale<br>
due to the possibility of peracid formation, are absent.<br>
An effective process is thus available for the preparation of N-(4,5-bis-<br>
methanesulfonyl-2-methylbenzoyl)guanidine, hydrochloride and its hydro-<br>
chloride hydrate which is significantly improved compared with the process<br>
known hitherto, both with respect to the number of synthesis steps and also<br>
with respect to the overall yield.<br>
Even without further comments, it is assumed that a person skilled in the<br>
art will be able to utilise the above description in the broadest scope. The<br>
preferred embodiments should therefore merely be regarded as descriptive<br>
disclosure which is absolutely not limiting in any way.<br>
The complete disclosure content of all applications and publications men-<br>
tioned above and below are incorporated into this application by way of<br>
reference.<br>
All temperature data above and below are given in °C.<br>
Example:<br>
1. Synthesis of 4,5-bismethanesulfonyl-2-methylbenzoic acid<br>
6 kg of 4-chloro-2-methyl-5-(methylsulfonyl)benzoic acid are dissolved in<br>
15 I of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) at room temperature (25°) and sub-<br>
sequently warmed to 50°. 3.6 kg of sodium methanesulfinate are added to<br>
this solution. The internal temperature is then raised to 120° and stirred at<br>
this temperature for 2 days, with a further 3 kg of sodium methanesulfinate<br>
being added after 24 hours. After cooling to 25°, the reaction mixture is<br>
introduced into 40 I of water, and 300 g of activated carbon and 1 kg of<br>
kieselguhr are added. 5 i of ice are added to the filtrate, and 3.5 I of con-<br>
centrated hydrochloric acid are added dropwise (pH = 1). Recrystallisation<br>
from 2-propanol gives 3.8 kg of 4,5-bismethanesulfonyl-2-methylbenzoic<br>
acid; m.p. 234-235°.<br>
2. Synthesis of N-(4,5-bismethanesulfonyl-2-methylbenzoyl)guanidine<br>
2.1. Synthesis of the acid chloride<br>
15 I of thionyl chloride are initially introduced at 40°, and 50 ml of DMF are<br>
added. 3.8 kg of 4,5-bismethanesulfonyl-2-methylbenzoic acid are slowly<br>
introduced with stirring, and the mixture is then stirred at the boiling point<br>
for 1 hour. After cooling, the excess SOCl2 is removed, and the residue is<br>
codistilled a number of times with 5 I of toluene, giving 4,5-bismethane-<br>
sulfonyl-2-methylbenzoyl chloride, which is reacted further as the crude<br>
product.<br>
2.2. Synthesis of the guanidine<br>
1.4 kg of sodium are dissolved in 15 I of boiling methanol under a protec-<br>
tive gas and diluted with a further 10 I of methanol. 5.9 kg of guanidinium<br>
hydrochloride are added to the solution, cooled to 20-22°, and the mixture<br>
is stirred for 1 hour. The resultant sodium chloride is then filtered off, and<br>
the solution is evaporated. The residue is codistilled with toluene and then<br>
taken up in 10 I of DMF.<br>
2.3 Synthesis of N-(4,5-bismethanesulfonyl-2-methylbenzoyl)guanidine<br>
A solution of 4,5-bismethanesulfonyl-2-methylbenzoyl chloride, prepared as<br>
described in 2.1., in 5 I of DMF is added dropwise at 12° to the guanidine<br>
solution prepared as described in 2.2. The reaction mixture is stirred at 20°<br>
for 5 hours, and 45 I of cold water (0-5°) are added slowly. The deposited<br>
crystals are filtered off and rinsed with ice-water, acetonitrile and diethyl<br>
ether. The crude crystals are dissolved in 315 I of hot acetonitrile/water<br>
(20:1). The solution is treated with 200 g of activated carbon, filtered and<br>
cooled to 0°, giving N-(4,5-bismethanesulfonyl-2-methylbenzoyl)guanidine<br>
as the acetonitrile adduct in a yield of 64.8%; m.p. 233-234°.<br>
3.1. Synthesis of N-(4,5-bismethanesulfonyl-2-methyibenzoyl)guanidine,<br>
hydrochloride hydrate<br>
2.7 kg of N-(4,5-bismethanesulfonyl-2-methylbenzoyl)guanidine are sus-<br>
pended in 25 I of water at 60°, and 10.6 I of 1N HCI solution are added. On<br>
warming to 80°, a clear solution is obtained. The solution is allowed to cool<br>
slowly, with crystallisation beginning at 50°, giving N-(4,5-bismethane-<br>
sulfonyl-2-methylbenzoyl)guanidine, hydrochloride hydrate in a yield of<br>
97%, m.p. 181-188°.<br>
3.2. Synthesis of N-(4,5-bismethanesu/fonyl-2-methylbenzoyl)guanidine,<br>
hydrochloride<br>
The N-(4,5-bismethanesulfonyl-2-methylbenzoyl)guanidine, hydrochloride<br>

hydrochloride<br>
2.7 kg of N-(4,5-bismethanesulfonyl-2-methylbenzoyl)guanidine are sus-<br>
pended in 25 I of ethanol at 60°, and 10.6 I of 1N HCI solution are added.<br>
On warming to 80°, a clear solution is obtained. The solution is allowed to<br>
cool slowly, with crystallisation beginning at 50°. The N-(4,5-bismethane-<br>
sulfonyl-2-methylbenzoyl)guanidine, hydrochloride obtained is subse-<br>
