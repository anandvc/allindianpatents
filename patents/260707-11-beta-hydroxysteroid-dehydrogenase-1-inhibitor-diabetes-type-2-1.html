				<td>The invention relates to inhibitors of 11ß-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase.  The inhibitors include, for example, pyrazolones and derivatives thereof and are useful for the treatment of diseases such as type II diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome. This application claims the benefit of priority to U.S. Provisional Application Serial No. 60/713,074, filed August 31, 2005, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. All documents cited or relied upon below are expressly incorporated herein by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Diabetes mellitus is a serious illness that affects an increasing number of people across the<br>
world. Its incidence is escalating parallel to the upward trend of obesity in many countries.<br>
The serious consequences of diabetes include increased risk of stroke, heart disease,<br>
kidney damage, blindness, and amputation.<br>
Diabetes is characterized by decreased insulin secretion and/or an impaired ability of peripheral tissues to respond to insulin, resulting in increased plasma glucose levels. There are two forms of diabetes: insulin-dependent and non-insulin-dependent, with the great majority of diabetics suffering from the non-insulin-dependent form of the disease, known as type 2 diabetes or non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Because of the serious consequences, there is an urgent need to control diabetes.<br>
Treatment of NIDDM generally starts with weight loss, a healthy diet and an exercise program. These factors are especially important in addressing the increased cardiovascular risks associated with diabetes, but they are generally ineffective in controlling the disease itself. There are a number of drug treatments available, including insulin, metformin, sulfonylureas, acarbose, and thiazolidinediones. However, each of these treatments has disadvantages, and there is an ongoing need for new drugs to treat diabetes. Metformin is an effective agent that reduces fasting plasma glucose levels and enhances the insulin sensitivity of peripheral tissue. Metformin has a number of effects in vivo, including an increase in the synthesis of glycogen, the polymeric form in which glucose is stored [R.<br>
A. De Fronzo Drugs 1999, 58 Suppl. l, 29]. Metformin also has beneficial effects on lipid profile, with favorable results on cardiovascular health. Treatment with metformin leads to reductions in the levels of LDL cholesterol and triglycerides [S. E. Inzucchi JAMA 2002, 287, 360]. However, over a period of years, metformin loses its effectiveness [R. C. Turner et al. JAMA 1999, 281, 2005] and there is consequently a need for new treatments for diabetes.<br>
Thiazolidinediones are activators of the nuclear receptor peroxisome-proliferator activated receptor-gamma. They are effective in reducing blood glucose levels, and their efficacy has been attributed primarily to decreasing insulin resistance in skeletal muscle [M. Tadayyon and S. A. Smith Expert Opin. Investig. Drugs 2003,12, 307]. One disadvantage associated with the use of thiazolidinediones is weight gain.<br>
Sulfonylureas bind to the sulfonylurea receptor on pancreatic beta cells, stimulate insulin secretion, and consequently reduce blood glucose levels. Weight gain is also associated with the use of sulfonylureas [S. E. Inzucchi JAMA 2002, 287, 360] and, like metformin, they lose efficacy over time [R. C. Turner et al. JAMA 1999, 281, 2005]. A further problem often encountered in patients treated with sulfonylureas is hypoglycemia [M. Sălaş J. J. and Caro Adv. DrugReact. Tox. Rev. 2002, 21, 205-217].<br>
Acarbose is an inhibitor of the enzyme alpha-glucosidase, which breaks down disaccharides and complex carbohydrates in the intestine. It has lower efficacy than metformin or the sulfonylureas, and it causes intestinal discomfort and diarrhea which often lead to the discontinuation of its use [S. E. Inzucchi JAMA 2002,257,360] Because none of these treatments is effective over the long term without serious side effects, there is a need for new drugs for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The metabolic syndrome is a condition where patients exhibit more than two of the foliowing symptoms: obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, low levels of HDL-cholesterol, high blood pressure, and elevated fasting glucose levels. This syndrome is often a precursor of type 2 diabetes, and has high prevalence in the United States with an estimated prevalence of 24% (E. S. Ford et al. JAMA 2002, 287, 356). A therapeutic agent that ameliorates the metabolic syndrome would be useful in potentially slowing or stopping the progression to type 2 diabetes.<br>
In the liver, glucose is produced by two different processes: gluconeogenesis, where new glucose is generated in a series of enzymatic reactions from pyruvate, and glycolysis, where glucose is generated by the breakdown of the polymer glycogen.<br>
Two of the key enzymes in the process of gluconeogenesis are phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) which catalyzes the conversion of oxalacetate to phosphoenolpyruvate, and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) which catalyzes the hydrolysis of glucose-6-phosphate to give free glucose. The conversion of oxalacetate to phosphoenolpyruvate, catalyzed by PEPCK, is the rate-1imiting step in gluconeogenesis. On fasting, both PEPCK and G6Pase are upregulated, allowing the rate of gluconeogenesis to increase. The levels of these enzymes are controlled in part by the corticosteroid hormones (cortisol in human and corticosterone in mouse). When the corticosteroid binds to the corticosteroid receptor, a signaling cascade is triggered which results in the upregulation of these enzymes.<br>
The corticosteroid hormones are found in the body along with their oxidized 11-dehydro counterparts (cortisone and 11-dehydrocorticosterone in human and mouse, respectively), which do not have activity at the glucocorticoid receptor. The actions of the hormone depend on the local concentration in the tissue where the corticosteroid receptors are expressed. This local concentration can differ from the circulating levels of the hormone in plasma, because of the actions of redox enzymes in the tissues. The enzymes that modify the oxidation state of the hormones are l Ibeta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases forms I and II. Form I (11ß-HSDl) is responsible for the reduction of cortisone to cortisol in vivo, while form II (11ß-HSD2) is responsible for the oxidation of cortisol to cortisone. The enzymes have low homology and are expressed in different tissues. 11ß-HSD1 is highly expressed in a number of tissues including liver, adipose tissue, and brain, while 11ß-HSD2 is highly expressed in mineralocorticoid target tissues, such as kidney and colon. 11ß-HSD2 prevents the binding of cortisol to the mineralocorticoid receptor, and defects in this enzyme have been found to be associated with the syndrome of apparent mineralocorticoid excess (AME).<br>
Since the binding of the 11ß-hydroxysteroids to the corticosteroid receptor leads to upregulation of PEPCK and therefore to increased blood glucose levels, inhibition of 11ß-HSD1 is a promising approach for the treatment of diabetes. In addition to the biochemical<br>
discussion above, there is evidence from transgenic mice, and also from small clinical studies in humans, that confirm the therapeutic potenţial of the inhibition of 11ß-HSDl. Experiments with transgenic mice indicate that modulation of the activity of 11ß-HSD1 could have beneficia! therapeutic effects in diabeies and in the metabolic syndrome. For example, when the 11ßVHSD1 gene is knocked out in mice, fasting does not lead to the normal increase in levels of G6Pase and PEPCK, and the animals are not susceptible to stress- or obesity-related hyperglycemia. Moreover, knockout animals which are rendered obese on a high-fat diet have significantly lower fasting glucose levels than weight-matched controls (Y. Kotolevtsev et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 1997, 94, 14924). 11ß-HSD1 knockout mice have also been found to have improved lipid profile, insulin sensitivity, and glucose tolerance (N. M. Morton et al. J. Biol. Chem. 2001, 276, 41293). The effect of overexpressing the 11ß-HSDl gene in mice has also been studied. These transgenic mice displayed increased llfî-HSDl activity in adipose tissue, and they also exhibit visceral obesity which is associated with the metabolic syndrome. Levels of the corticosterone were increased in adipose tissue, but not in serum, and the mice hâd increased levels of obesity, especially when on a high-fat diet. Mice fed on low-fat diets were hyperglycemic and hyperinsulinemic, and also showed glucose intolerance and insulin resistance (H. Masuzaki et al. Science, 2001,294,2166).<br>
The effects of the non-selective 11ß-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase inhibitor carbenoxolone have been studied in a number of small trials in humans. In one study, carbenoxolone was found to lead to an increase in whole body insulin sensitivity, and this increase was attributed to a decrease in hepatic glucose production (B. R. Walker et al. J. Clin. Endocrinei Metab. 1995, 80, 3155). In another study, decreased glucose production and glycogenolysis in response to glucagon challenge were observed in diabetic but not healthy subjects (R. C. Andrews et al. J. Clin. Enocrinol. Metab. 2003, 88, 285). Finally, carbenoxolone was found to improve cognitive function in healthy elderly men and also in type 2 diabetics (T. C. Sandeep et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA 2004,101,6734). A number of non-specific inhibitors of 11ß-HSDl and 11ß-HSD2 have been identified, including glycyrrhetinic acid, abietic acid, and carbenoxolone. hi addition, a number of selective inhibitors of 11ß-HSD1 have been found, including chenodeoxycholic acid, fiavanone and 2'-hydroxyflavanone (S. Diederich et al. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 2000,142, 200 and R. A. S. Schweizer et al. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2003,272,41).<br>

"Pharmaceutically acceptable salt" refers to convenţional acid-addition salts or base-addition salts that retain the biological effectiveness and properties of the compounds of<br>
formula I and are formed from suitable organic or inorganic acids or organic or inorganic bases. Sample acid-addition salts include those derived from inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydroiodic acid, sulfuric acid, sulfamic acid, phosphoric acid and nitric acid, and those derived from organic acids such as p-toluenesulfonic acid, salicylic acid, methanesulfonic acid, oxalic acid, succinic acid, citric acid, malic acid, lactic acid, fumărie acid, and the like. Sample base-addition salts include those derived from ammonium, potassium, sodium and, quaternary ammonium hydroxides, such as for example, tetramethylammonium hydroxide. The cheniical modification of a pharmaceutical compound (i.e. drug) into a salt is a well known technique which is used in attempting to improve properties involving physical or chemical stability, e.g., hygroscopicity, flowability or solubility of compounds. See, e.g., H. Ansei et. al., Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems (6th Ed. 1995) at pp. 196 and 1456-1457.<br>
"Pharmaceutically acceptable ester" refers to a conventionally esterified compound of formula I having a carboxyl group, which esters retain the biological effectiveness and properties of the compounds of formula I and are cleaved in vivo (in the organism) to the corresponding active carboxylic acid. Examples of ester groups which are cleaved (in this case hydrolyzed) in vivo to the corresponding carboxylic acids are those in which the hydrogen is replaced with -1ower alkyl which is optionally substituted, e.g., with heterocycle, cycloalkyl, etc. Examples of substituted lower alkyl esters are those in which lower alkyl is substituted with pyrrolidine, piperidine, morpholine, N-methylpiperazine, etc. The group which is cleaved in vivo may be, for example, ethyl, morpholino ethyl, and diethylamino ethyl. In connection with the present invention, -CONH2 is also considered an ester, as the -NH2 may be cleaved in vivo and replaced with a hydroxy group, to form the corresponding carboxylic acid.<br>
Further information concerning examples of and the use of esters for the delivery of pharmaceutical compounds is available in Design of Prodrugs. Bundgaard H. ed. (Elsevier, 1985). See also, H. Ansei et. al., Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems (6th Ed. 1995) at pp. 108-109; Krogsgaard-1arsen, et. al., Textbook of Drug Design and Development (2d Ed. 1996) at pp. 152-191.

General Synthesis of Compounds According to the Invention<br>
The compounds of the present invention can be prepared by any convenţional means. Suitable processes for synthesizing these compounds are provided in the examples. Generally, compounds of formula I can be prepared according to Scheme l, or Scheme 3 (see below). The sources of the starting materials for these reactions are also described. Note that unless otherwise indicated, the structures below show relative stereochemistry, and the chemical transformations described below can be carried out on compounds derived from racemic camphor or from either of the enantiomers.<br>
Preparation of Compounds of the Invention According to Scheme l<br><br><br><br>
Scheme l     (Scheme Removed)<br>
Compounds of formula l can be prepared from camphor which has formula 2 and which is commercially available as the racemate or as either enantiomer, for example from Aldrich Chemical Company, Milwaukee, WI. Thus camphor is treated with a strong base such as lithium diisopropylamide or lithium hexamethyldisilazide in an inert solvent such as tetrahydrofuran at low temperature, for example about -78 degrees. The resulting solution is then added to dry ice to give a mixture of endo- and exo-camphorcarboxylic acids, or alternatively dry carbon dioxide gas is bubbled through a solution of the anion to give the same product. Conditions suitable for this reaction can be found in the literature, for example in W. W. Shumway et al. J. Org. Chem. 2001, 66, 5832-5839. Racemic 3-camphorcarboxylic acid is available commercially from the SALOR catalogue of Aldrich Chemical Company, Milwaukee, WI.  (Formula Removed)<br>
The resulting keto-acid of formula 3 can then be converted to an aryl-hydrazide of formula 4 where R2 is aryl using one of a number of procedures that are familiar to one of average skill in the art of organic synthesis. For example, the keto-acid of formula 3 can be converted to the acid chloride of formula 13 by treatment with a chlorinating agent, such as thionyl chloride, either neat or in an inert solvent such as benzene at a temperature between about -5 degrees and about 80 degrees, preferably between about -5 degrees and about room temperature. Conditions suitable for this reaction can be found in the literature, for example in H. Staudinger and S. Schotz Chem. Ber. 1920, 53B, 1105-1124 Chemical Abstracts 14:18286; in S. Nagai et al. Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1979, 27, 1764-1770; and in W. W. Shumway et al. J. Org. Chem. 2001, 66, 5832-5839. The acid chloride is then treated with an aryl-hydrazine of formula ArNHNH2 in an inert solvent such as an aromatic hydrocarbon such as benzene at about room temperature to give a hydrazide of formula 4. This hydrazide can then be treated with aqueous sodium hydroxide at about 100 degrees to give the pyrazolone of formula 5 where R2 is aryl. Conditions for this reaction can be found in the literature, for example in A. Esanu GB 2 157 690. Alternatively, the hydrazide<br>
can be treated with concentrated hydrochloric acid to affect the cyclization. Conditions for this reaction can be found in the literature, for example in H. Wahl, Ber. Dtsch. Chem. Ges. 1899,32,1987-1991.<br>
Alternatively, a pyrazolone of formula 5 can be prepared from the keto-acid of formula 3 by conversion of the keto-acid to an ester followed by reaction with an aryl-hydrazine. For example, the keto-acid of formula 3 can be converted to the ethyl ester of formula 6 (see below) with sulfuric acid in ethanol at around room temperature. The resulting ethyl ester is then treated with an aryl-hydrazine in the presence of a chlorinating agent such as phosphorus trichloride or phosphorus oxychloride in an inert solvent such as toluene at about 100 degrees, Conditions suitable for this reaction can be found in the literature, for example in Laboratoires Marinier FR 1.271.246 and FR 701; and in H. Wahl Chem. Ber. 1899,32,1987-1991.<br>
Scheme 2     (Scheme Removed)<br>
As a further alternative, the pyrazolone of formula 5 can be prepared by reaction of the acid chloride of formula 13 with the ethylidene hydrazone of formula 14. This reaction is conveniently carried out in the presence of an aromatic base such as pyridine in an inert solvent such as a chlorinated hydrocarbon (e.g., 1,2-dichloroethane) at a temperature about 50 °C. The resulting hydrazide can be converted to the desired pyrazolone by treatment with acid, such as a mixture of hydrochloric acid and glacial acetic acid at a temperature about 100 °C. The ethylidene hydrazone of formula 14 is prepared from an aryl-hydrazine of formula ArNHNH2 using the procedure described in A. R. Maguire et al. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2001,9, 745-762.<br><br>
Scheme 2b   (Scheme Removed)<br>
An additional approach to the synthesis of pyrazolone 5 is shown in Scheme 2b. According to this approach, the acid chloride of formula 13 can be reacted with a tert-butoxy-carbonyl-protected hydrazine of formula 15 and the intermediate can be cyclized in the presence of acid. This reaction is conveniently carried out by heating the acid chloride of formula 13 with the tert-butoxy-carbonyl-protected hydrazine of formula 15 and a base, such as triethylamine or pyridine, in the presence of an inert solvent such as 1,2-dichloroethane at a temperature about 100 °C to give the intermediate hydrazide, and then treating this with hydrochloric acid again in a solvent (such as a mixture of dioxane and acetic acid), and heating again at about 100 °C.<br>
The pyrazolone of formula 5 can be reacted with an alkyl halide or an aralkyl halide to give the compound of the invention of formula 1. The reaction can conveniently be carried out by treatment of the pyrazolone of formula 5 with an electrophile (for example, methyl sulfate, ethyl iodide, or benzyl bromide) in an inert solvent such as N,N-dimethylformamide at a temperature about 100 °C. The reaction can also be carried out in the additional presence of a base (such as sodium hydroxide) again in an inert solvent, such as for example in aqueous sodium hydroxide solution in the opţional additional presence of ethanol as a co-solvent. Conditions suitable for this reaction can be found in the literature, for example in Laboratoires Marinier FR 1.271.246 and FR 701; and in G. H. Alt and J. P Chupp Tetrahedron Lett. 1970, 36, 3155-3158. In the presence of base, the alkylation reaction typically gives a mixture of products which have been alkylated on nitrogen or oxygen. These products are typically easily separable using processes well known to one of skill in the art such as recrystallization or chromatography. Additionally, the pyrazolone of formula 5 can be converted to the compound of the invention of formula l by treatment with benzoyl chloride in aqueous potassium hydroxide solution at about O °C to give the benzoyloxypyrazole, followed by treatment with an alkyl halide or aralkyl halide at about<br>
100 °C to give the Nl-alkyl- or Nl-aralkyl-3-benzoyloxypyrazole, followed by treatment with aqueous sodium hydroxide solution at about 100 °C to give the compound of formula 1. Conditions suitable for this reaction can be found in the literature, for example in H. Wahl Chem. Ber. 1899,32,1987-1991.<br>
Preparation of Compounds of the Invention According to Scheme 3<br><br>
Scheme 3    (Scheme Removed)<br>
The keto-ester of formula 6, prepared as described above, can be treated with hydrazine in an inert solvent such as ethanol at reflux to give a pyrazolone of formula 7. For convenient conditions, see P. C. Guha and N. K. Seshadriengar Chem. Ber. 1936, 69B, 1212-1218, or F. Ramirez and J. W. Sargent J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1955, 77, 6297-6306. The pyrazolone of formula 7 can be converted to the substituted pyrazolone of formula 8 using reactions analogous to those described above for the conversion of a compound of formula 5 to a compound of formula 1. For an example of appropriate conditions, see B. Jursic and N. Bregant Synth. Commun. 1989,19, 2087-2094. The substituted pyrazolone of formula 8 is then converted to the compound of formula l using one of a variety of reactions that are known in the art. For example, in the case where R2 is an aryl group, an SNAT nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction or a copper-catalyzed arylation reaction can be used. For example, the pyrazolone of formula 8 can be treated with an electron-deficient aromatic ring bearing a leaving group (for example, 2,4-dinitro-fluorobenzene) in an inert solvent such as ethanol at the reflux temperature. See for example C. Dardonville et al. New Journal of Chemistry 1998, 22, 1421-1430; or P. Nair et al. Tetrahedron 1960, 11, 140-147. As a further example, the pyrazolone of formula 8 can be treated with a halo-aromatic compound (such as a brominated or iodinated benzene derivative or heterocycle) in the<br>
presence of a copper catalyst such as copper(I) iodide or copper(I) chloride or copper(II) oxide or copper on silica, in the presence of a base such as cesium carbonate or potassium carbonate or potassium phosphate or sodium tert-butoxide and in the opţional additional presence of a ligand {for example 1,10-phenanthroline or trans-1,2-cyclohexanediamine or ethylenediamine) in an inert solvent such as dimethylformamide or dioxane or xylene or N-methylpyrrolidone at a temperature between about 80 degrees and about 150 degrees. Examples of suitable conditions can be found in the literaturo, for example in M. Wolter et al. Org. Letters 2001, 3, 3803-3805; in A. Klapars et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001, 123, 7727-7729; in B. Renger Synthesis 1985, 856-806; in G. M. Coppola J. Heterocycl. Chem. 1987, 24, 1249-1251; in A. Greiner Synthesis 1989, 312-313; in T. Maruyama et al. /. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 11995, 733-734; in S.-K. Kang et al. Synlett 2002,427-430; and in J. H. M Lange et al. Tetrahedron Lett. 2002, 43, 1101-1104. It is also possible to carry out a similar reaction using palladium catalysis in place of copper catalysis (see W. C Shakespeare Tetrahedron Lett. 1999, 40, 2035-2038). As a third example, the pyrazolone of formula 8 can be treated with aryl-boronic acid in the presence of a copper catalyst such as copper(II) acetate in the presence of a base such as a mixture of triethylamine and pyridine in an inert solvent such as dichloromethane at about room temperature. Examples of suitable conditions can be found in the literature, for example in D. M. T. Chan et al. Tetrahedron Lett. 1998, 39, 2933-2936; and in W. W. K. R. Mederski et al. Tetrahedron 1999, 55, 12757-12770. In the case where R2 is a benzylic group or a group of formula -CH2Het where Het is a heterocycle, the compound of formula l can be made by reaction of the pyrazolone of formula 8 with the appropriate benzyl halide or chloromethyl- or bromomethyl-heterocycle. The reaction can be conveniently carried out by treating the pyrazolone of formula 8 with the appropriate electrophile in the absence of base in an inert solvent such as N,N-dimethylforrnamide at a temperature around 100 °C. In certain cases, for example where the R2 group contains a nucleophilic substructure such as a pyrazole, it will be appropriate to use a benzyl halide or chloromethyl- or bromomethyl-heterocycle which bears an additional protective group masking the nucleophile, for example a trityl group. An additional step will then be required to complete the synthesis of the compound of formula 1. Examples of R2 groups bearing nucleophilic substructures will be apparent to one of skill in the art of organic synthesis. One example is IH-pyrazole, where the trityl<br>
group can be used as a convenient protective group. The trityl group is conveniently removed by treatment with trifluoroacetic acid in an inert solvent such as dichloromethane.<br><br>
Scheme 4    (Scheme Removed)<br>
An additional approach to the synthesis of pyrazolone 8 is shown in Scheme 4. According to this approach, the keto-ester of formula 6 can be reacted with a tert-butoxy-carbonyl-protected hydrazine of formula 11 to give a hydrazide of formula 12. This reaction is conveniently carried out by heating the keto-ester with the tert-butoxy-carbonyl-protected hydrazine in the absence of solvent at a temperature about 100 °C to give the intermediate hydrazide, and then treating this with concentrated hydrochloric acid, and heating again at about 100 °C. It will be clear to one of average skill in the art of organic synthesis that the acid chloride derived from the keto-acid of formula 3 as described above can be used in place of the keto-ester of formula 6. In this case, the acid chloride is treated with the tert-butoxy-carbonyl-protected hydrazine of formula 11 in an inert solvent such as a chlorinated hydrocarbon (e.g., dichloromethane) or an aromatic hydrocarbon (e.g., benzene) in the presence of a base such as pyridine or diisopropylethylamine at about room temperature to give the hydrazide of formula 12.        <br>
Scheme 5 (Scheme Removed)<br>
As shown in Scheme 5, in cases where R1 = R2, compounds of the invention of formula l can be made by treating the keto-ester of formula 6 with a hydrazine of formula<br>
R1NHNHR2 in an inert solvent such as N,N-dimethylformamide at a temperature about 100 °C.<br><br>
Scheme 5a<br>
Compounds of formula l, for example where R2 represents a carbocyclic or heterocyclic aryl group and Rl represents an optionally substituted lower-alkyl or aralkyl group, can also be prepared as shown in Scheme 5a. According to this process, a boronic acid of formula 10 reacts with a tert-butoxycarbonyl-protected aryl hydrazine of formula 11 to give an intermediate substituted hydrazine of formula 16, which reacts with the acid chloride of formula 13 to give the compound of formula 1. The reaction of the boronic acid of formula 10 with the hydrazine of formula 11 can be carried out under any convenţional condiţiona. For example, this reaction can be conveniently carried out using a copper salt such as copper(II) acetate as a catalyst in the presence of an amine such as triethylamine in an inert solvent such as l ,2-dichloroethane at a temperature around 100 °C. Slightly different reaction conditions can be found in the literature for similar or related transformations, for example in G. W. Kabalka and S. K. Guchhait Org. Lett. 2005, 5, 4129-4131 and in O. V. Dyablo et al. Chem. Heterocycl. Compd. 2002,38, 620-621. The reaction of the substituted hydrazine derivative of formula 16 with the acid chloride of formula 13 is conveniently carried out in the presence of a base (such as triethylamine or pyridine) in an inert solvent such as l ,2-dichloroethane. The reaction can be carried out at at temperature between about O °C and about room temperature. This reaction results in the formation of a hydrazide intermediate which bears a tert-butoxycarbonyl proiective group. Treatment of a solution of this hydrazide intermediate (for example with a solution of 4M HC1 in dioxane) results in cleavage of the proective group and cyclization Io the compound of formula 1. The cyclization reaction is conveniently carried out at a temperature between about 70 °C and around 100 °C, preferably at around 80 °C.<br><br><br>
Scheme 5b   (Scheme Removed)<br>
As will be apparent to one of skill in the art of organic synthesis, many compounds of formula l can be prepared from other compounds of formula l by funcţional group interconversions. Many examples of such interconversions are well known in the field of organic chemistry, and one non-1imiting example is shown in Scheme 5b. According to this process, a compound of formula 17 which is a compound of formula l in which the Rl group bears a lower-alkoxy carbonyl substituent can be converted into a compound of formula 18 by reduction of the lower-alkoxy carbonyl group. This reaction can be carried out by any convenţional means. For example, the compound of formula 17 may be treated with a reducing agent such as lithium aluminum hydride (or diisobutylaluminum hydride or the like) in an inert solvent such as tetrahydrofuran at a temperature between about O °C and about room temperature, conveniently at about room temperature.<br>

Scheme 6  (Scheme Removed)<br>
An aryl-boronic acid of formula 10 can conveniently be synthesized according to Scheme 6 from an aryl bromide or iodide of formula 14, by treatment with an alkyllithium (e.g., n-butyllithium) or magnesium (to form the Grignard reagent) in a suitable inert solvent such as an ether (such as tetrahydrofuran or diethyl ether) at a temperature appropriate for the reaction (for example, at approximately -78 degrees for reaction with an alkyllithium, or at approximately room temperature for reaction with magnesium), followed by treatment with a trialkyl borate to form the compound of formula 10.<br>
Boc-protected hydrazines of formula 11 can be prepared by a variety of procedures. For<br>
example, a hydrazine of formula R1NHNH2 can be reacted with tert-butyl-S-methyl-<br>
thiocarbonate or di-tert-butyl-dicarbonate in an inert solvent at a temperature between<br>
about -5 °C and about room temperature. Suitable conditions for such reactions can be<br>
found in the literature, for example in K. A. Jensen et al. Acta Chem Scand. 1968,22,1-50,<br>
or in J.-N. Xiang et al. WO 2002070541. Alternatively, N-tert-<br>
butyloxycarbonylaminotetrachlorophthalimide	or	N-tert-<br>
butyloxycarbonylaminophthalimide can be reacted in a Mitsunobu reaction with an alcohol of formula R1OH followed by deprotection with hydrazine to give the compound of formula 11. Again, suitable conditions for such reactions can be found in the literature, for example in M.-F. Pinto et al. Synth. Commun. 2002, 32, 3603-3610 or in N. Brosse et al. J. Org. Chem. 2000, 65, 4370.<br>
Alkylhydrazines of formula R1NHNH2 suitable for the preparation of formula 11 are either commercially available or can be prepared using reactions that are well known in the art. For example, tert-butyl carbazate undergoes reductive alkylation by reduction of the hydrazone generated by reaction with an alkyl aldehyde or ketone. Removal of the tert-butoxycarbonyl protective group by treatment with acid (for example, sulfuric acid) gives the alkylhydrazine. Conditions suitable for this reaction can be found in the literature, for example in H. Hilpert Tetrahedron 2001, 57, 7675-7683; and in N. I. Ghali et al. J. Org.<br>
Chem. 1981, 46, 5413-5414. Alternatively, reaction of an alkyl amine with N-(diethoxyphosphoroyl)-O-(p-nitrophenylsulfonyl)-hydroxylamine, followed by treatment of the resulting intermediate with acid (for example, p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate) gives the alkylhydrazine. Conditions suitable for this reaction can be found in the literature, for example in A. Koziara et al. Synth. Commun. 1995,25, 3805-3812. tert-Butoxy-carbonyl-protected aryl-hydrazines of formula 15 can be prepared by reacting an aryl-hydrazine of formula ArNHNH2 with di-tert-butyl-dicarbonate in an inert solvent such as an alcohol (e.g., methanol) or a mixture of water with an organic solvent such as ethyl acetate. The reaction is conveniently carried out at room temperature. In the practice of the method of the present invention, an effective amount of any one of the compounds of this invention or a combination of any of the compounds of this invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or ester thereof, îs administered via any of the usual and acceptable methods known in the art, either singly or in combination. The compounds or compositions can thus be administered orally (e.g., buccal cavity), sublingually, parenterally (e.g., intramuscularly, intravenously, or subcutaneously), rectally (e.g., by suppositories or washings), transdermally (e.g., skin electroporation) or by inhalation (e.g., by aerosol), and in the form or solid, liquid or gaseous dosages, including tablets and suspensions. The administration can be conducted in a single unit dosage form with continuous therapy or in a single dose therapy ad libitum. The therapeutic composition can also be in the form of an oil emulsion or dispersion in conjunction with a lipophilic salt such as pamoic acid, or in the form of a biodegradable sustained-release composition for subcutaneous or intramuscular administration.<br>
Useful pharmaceutical carriers for the preparation of the compositions hereof, can be solids, liquids or gases; thus, the compositions can take the form of tablets, pills, capsules, suppositories, powders, enterically coated or other protected formulations (e.g. binding on ion-exchange resins or packaging in lipid-protein vesicles), sustained release formulations, solutions, suspensions, elixirs, aerosols, and the like. The carrier can be selected from the various oils including those of petroleum, animal, vegetable or synthetic origin, e.g., peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, sesame oil, and the like. Water, saline, aqueous dextrose, and glycols are preferred liquid carriers, particularly (when isotonic with the blood) for injectable solutions. For example, formulations for intravenous administration comprise sterile aqueous solutions of the active ingredient(s) which are prepared by dissolving solid<br>
active ingredient(s) in water to produce an aqueous solution, and rendering the solution sterile. Suitable pharmaceutical excipients include starch, cellulose, talc, glucose, lactose, talc, gelatin, malt, rice, flour, chalk, silica, magnesium stearate, sodium stearate, glycerol monostearate, sodium chloride, dried skim milk, glycerol, propylene glycol, water, ethanol, and the like. The compositions may be subjected to convenţional pharmaceutical additives such as preservatives, stabilizing agents, wetting or emulsifying agents, salts for adjusting osmotic pressure, buffers and the like. Suitable pharmaceutical carriers and their formulation are described in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences by E. W. Martin. Such compositions will, in any event, contain an effective amount of the active compound together with a suitable carrier so as to prepare the proper dosage form for proper administration to the recipient.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations can also contain preserving agents, solubilizing agents, stabilizing agents, wetting agents, emulsifying agents, sweetening agents, coloring agents, flavoring agents, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffers, coating agents or antioxidants.

Example 160: Testing of Compounds of the Invention in vitro (Cell-based assay)<br>
The in vitro inhibition of 11B-HSD1 in a cell-based assay by compounds of the present invention was demonsrrated by means of the following test:<br>
HEK-293 cells stably transfected with full-length human 11betaHSD1 cDNA were propagated and expanded in DMEM high glucose media (Invitrogen Cat# 11995-065), supplemented with 10% FCS (Invitrogen Cat# 10082-147), pen/strep (10 yg/rnL), and geneticin (10 ug/mL). One day prior to assay, cells were released from flasks using trypsin/EDTA, centrifuged, and washed with plating media (DMEM high glucose, without phenol red; Invitrogen Cat# 21063-029, supplemented with 2% charcoal stripped FCS; Gemini Cat# A22311P). From a 250,000 cells/ml suspension in plating media, 200 ui of cells were seeded into each well of a 96-well coated plate (BioCoat Cat#356461) and cultured overnight at 37 °C. The following day, serially diluted HbHSDl inhibitor compounds dissolved in DMSO were added to plating media supplemented with BSA (2mg/ml final). The final DMSO concentration was 1%. Media was aspirated from plates, and compounds in media were added to each well. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for l<br>
hour to allow for cellular uptake of compounds. 10 uL of substrate (cortisone) was then added to each well (100 nM final concentration) and incubated for l hour at 37 °C. Plates were then transferred to ice and 80 µL of media transferred to a 96-well plate and stored at -30 °C.<br>
Quantitation of cortisol in cell media was performed by competitive ELISA using ELISA-Light (Tropix Cat# T10206/EL100S4), anti-cortisol EIA antibody (Assay Designs, Inc. Cat#80-1148), and cortisol-enzyme conjugate (Assay Designs, Inc. Cat# 80-1147). 384-well plates (Falcon Cat#3988) were precoated with anti-mouse IgG (Sigma Cat# M-1397) suspended in 0.9% NaCl (5 mg/mL), 50 µL per well, ovemight at 4 °C. Plates were washed with PBS, 0.1% Tween-20, then washed with PBS alone. Plates were blocked with Blocking Buffer (Tropix Cat# AI075) for 2 hours at room temperature. The plates were then washed as previously described. Assay samples were thawed, diluted l :4 in DMEM, 2 mg/mL BSA, 1% DMSO, and 24 µL was transferred to wells of a pre-coated 384-well plate, as well as varying amounts of cortisol standard. To each well, 12 µL of cortisol-conjugate and 12 µL of anti-cortisol EIA antibody were added and incubated 2 hrs at room temperature on a orbital plate shaker. The wells were then emptied by inversion, then washed three times with 100 µL of Wash Buffer (Tropix), and then 2 times with 100 µL of Assay Buffer (Tropix). 60 µL of CDP-STAR (Tropix) was added to each well and incubated 10 minutes at room temperature. Chemiluminescence was measured using a Victor V Reader (Perkin Elmer). Cortisol in each sample was interpolated from a standard curve generated with known amounts of cortisol. IC50 values were calculated using the curve fitting software XLFit3 (IDBS).<br>
