METHOD FOR TRANSMITTING FEEDBACK DATA IN<br>
MULTIPLE ANTENNA SYSTEM<br>
Technical Field<br>
[1] The present invention relates to wireless communications, and more particularly, to a<br>
method for transmitting feedback data in a multiple antenna system.<br>
[2]<br>
Background Art<br>
[3] Wireless communication systems are widely used to provide various types of com-<br>
munications. For example, voice and/or data are provided by the wireless commu-<br>
nication systems. A conventional wireless communication system provides multiple<br>
users with one or more shared resources. For example, the wireless communication<br>
system can use various multiple access schemes such as code division multiple access<br>
(CDMA), time division multiple access (TDMA), and frequency division multiple<br>
access (FDMA).<br>
[4] An orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) scheme uses a plurality of<br>
orthogonal subcarriers. Further, the OFDM scheme uses an orthogonality between<br>
inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) and fast Fourier transform (FFT). A transmitter<br>
transmits data by performing IFFT. A receiver restores original data by performing<br>
FFT on a received signal. The transmitter uses IFFT to combine the plurality of sub-<br>
carriers, and the receiver uses FFT to split the plurality of subcarriers. According to the<br>
OFDM scheme, complexity of the receiver can be reduced in a frequency selective<br>
fading environment of a broadband channel, and spectral efficiency can be improved<br>
through selective scheduling in a frequency domain by utilizing channel characteristics<br>
which are different from one subcarrier to another. An orthogonal frequency division<br>
multiple access (OFDMA) scheme is an OFDM-based multiple access scheme.<br>
According to the OFDMA scheme, a radio resource can be more efficiently used by al-<br>
locating different subcarriers to multiple users.<br>
[5] Recently, to maximize performance and communication capability of the wireless<br>
communication system, attention is paid to a multiple input multiple output (MIMO)<br>
system. Being evolved from the conventional technique in which a single transmit (Tx)<br>
antenna and a single receive (Rx) antenna are used, a MIMO technique uses multiple<br>
Tx antennas and multiple Rx antennas in order to improve efficiency of data<br>
transmission and reception. The MIMO system is also referred to as a multiple antenna<br>
system. In the MIMO technique, instead of receiving one whole message through a<br>
single antenna path, data segments are received through a plurality of antennas and are<br>
then assembled into one piece of data. As a result, a data transfer rate can be improved<br>
in a specific range, or a system range can increase with respect to a specific data<br>
transfer rate.<br>
[6] Hereinafter, downlink is defined as a communication link from a base station (BS) to<br>
a user equipment (UE), and uplink is defined as a communication link from the UE to<br>
the BS.<br>
[7] In general, the BS schedules uplink and downlink radio resources in the wireless<br>
communication system. User data or control signals are carried using the uplink and<br>
downlink radio resources. A channel for carrying user data is referred to as a data<br>
channel. A channel for carrying control information is referred to as a control channel.<br>
[8] For radio resource scheduling of the BS, the UE reports feedback data to the BS. In<br>
the multiple antenna system, the feedback data includes a channel quality indicator<br>
(CQI), a rank indicator (RI), a precoding matrix indicator (PMI), etc. The UE transmits<br>
the feedback data (e.g., CQI, RI, PMI, etc.) to the BS. According to the feedback data<br>
received from a plurality of UEs, the BS schedules uplink and downlink radio<br>
resources. A whole frequency band is divided into a plurality of subbands. The BS can<br>
schedule the radio resources for each subband. From an aspect of radio resource<br>
scheduling of the BS, it is most effective when the UE obtains respective CQIs and<br>
PMIs for all subbands and reports the obtained CQIs and PMIs to the BS. However, a<br>
significantly large overhead is caused when the CQIs and PMIs for all subbands are<br>
transmitted with limited radio resources.<br>
[9] Accordingly, there is a need for a method for effectively transmitting CQIs and PMIs<br>
in a multiple antenna system.<br>
[10]<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
Technical Problem<br>
[11] The present invention provides a method for transmitting feedback data in a multiple<br>
antenna system.<br>
[12]<br>
Technical Solution<br>
[13] In an aspect, a method of transmitting feedback data in a multiple antenna system<br>
comprises receiving a request message of feedback data on a downlink channel, the<br>
request message comprising uplink scheduling information, selecting a set of M (M=l)<br>
subbands within a plurality of subbands, generating the feedback data, the feedback<br>
data comprising a frequency selective PMI (precoding matrix indicator), a frequency<br>
flat PMI, a best band CQI (channel quality indicator) and a whole band CQI, the<br>
frequency selective PMI indicating the index of a precoding matrix selected from a<br>
codebook over the M selected subbands, the frequency flat PMI indicating the index of<br>
a precoding matrix selected from the codebook over the plurality of subbands, the best<br>
band CQI indicating a CQI value over the M selected subbands, the whole band CQI<br>
indicating a CQI value over the plurality of subbands, and transmitting the feedback<br>
data on a uplink channel allocated to the uplink scheduling information.<br>
[14] In another aspect, a method of transmitting feedback data in a multiple antenna<br>
system comprises selecting a set of M (M=l) subbands within a plurality of subbands,<br>
and transmitting feedback data on a uplink shared channel, the feedback data<br>
comprising a frequency selective PMI, a frequency flat PMI, a best band CQI and a<br>
whole band CQI, the frequency selective PMI indicating the index of a precoding<br>
matrix selected from a codebook over the M selected subbands, the frequency flat PMI<br>
indicating the index of a precoding matrix selected from the codebook over the<br>
plurality of subbands, the best band CQI indicating a CQI value over the M selected<br>
subbands, the whole band CQI indicating a CQI value over the plurality of subbands.<br>
[15]<br>
Advantageous Effects<br>
[16] According to the present invention, an overhead caused by transmission of feedback<br>
data can be reduced, and radio resource scheduling can be effectively achieved in a<br>
multiple antenna system.<br>

Mode for the Invention<br>
[50] FIG. 1 shows a wireless communication system. The wireless communication system<br>
can be widely deployed to provide a variety of communication services, such as<br>
voices, packet data, etc.<br>
[51] Referring to FIG. 1, the wireless communication system includes at least one user<br>
equipment (UE) 10 and a base station (BS) 20. The UE 10 may be fixed or mobile, and<br>
may be referred to as another terminology, such as a mobile station (MS), a user<br>
terminal (UT), a subscriber station (SS), a wireless device, etc. The BS 20 is generally<br>
a fixed station that communicates with the UE 10 and may be referred to as another<br>
terminology, such as a node-B, a base transceiver system (BTS), an access point, etc.<br>
There are one or more cells within the coverage of the BS 20.<br>
[52] There is no restriction on a multiple access scheme used in the wireless commu-<br>
nication system. The multiple access scheme may be based on code division multiple<br>
access (CDMA), time division multiple access (TDMA), frequency division multiple<br>
access (FDMA), single-carrier FDMA (SC-FDMA), orthogonal frequency division<br>
multiple access (OFDMA), or other well-known modulation schemes. For clarity, an<br>
OFDMA-based wireless communication system will be described hereinafter.<br>
[53] The wireless communication system may be a multiple antenna system. The multiple<br>
antenna system may be a multiple input multiple output (MIMO) system. Alter-<br>
natively, the multiple antenna system may be a multiple-input single-output (MISO)<br>
system or a single-input multiple-output (SIMO) system. The MIMO system uses a<br>
plurality of transmit (Tx) antennas and a plurality of receive (Rx) antennas. The MISO<br>
system uses a plurality of Tx antennas and one Rx antenna. The SIMO system uses one<br>
Tx antenna and a plurality of Rx antennas.<br>
[54] FIG. 2 is a block diagram showing a transmitter having multiple antennas.<br>
[55] Referring to FIG. 2, a transmitter 100 includes a scheduler 110, channel encoders<br>
120-1 to 120-K, mappers 130-1 to 130-K, precoders 140-1 to 140-K, and a multiplexer<br>
150. The transmitter 100 includes Nt (Nt&gt;1) Tx antennas 190-1 to 190-Nt. The<br>
transmitter 100 may be a part of a BS in downlink. The transmitter 100 may be a part<br>
of a UE in uplink.<br>
[56] The scheduler 110 receives data from N users and outputs K streams to be con-<br>
currently transmitted. By using channel information of each user, the scheduler 110 de-<br>
termines a user and a data transfer rate for transmitting data through available radio<br>
resources. The scheduler 110 extracts a CQI from feedback data, and selects a<br>
modulation and coding scheme (MCS) or the like. The CQI includes a signal to noise<br>
ratio (SNR), a signal to interference and noise ratio (SINR), etc., determined between<br>
the transmitter and a receiver.<br>
[57] The available radio resources allocated by the scheduler 110 denote radio resources<br>
used for data transmission in the wireless communication system. For example, all<br>
time slots are resources in a TDMA system, all codes and time slots are resources in a<br>
CDMA system, and all subcarrier and time slots are resources in an OFDMA system.<br>
The respective resources may be orthogonal to each other by definition in a time, code,<br>
or frequency domain so that interference to another user does not occur in the same<br>
cell or sector.<br>
[58] The channel encoders 120-1 to 120-K encode input streams according to a prede-<br>
termined coding scheme, and thus generate coded data. The mappers 130-1 to 130-K<br>
map the coded data onto symbols representing locations on a signal constellation.<br>
These symbols are called data symbols. There is no restriction on a modulation<br>
scheme. The modulation scheme may be m-phase shift keying (m-PSK) or m-<br>
quadrature amplitude modulation (m-QAM). For example, the m-PSK may be binary<br>
PSK (BPSK), quadrature PSK (QPSK), or 8-PSK. The m-QAM may be 16-QAM,<br>
64-QAM, or 256-QAM.<br>
[59] The precoders 140-1 to 140-K perform precoding on received data symbols u1,...,uK<br>
and thus generate input symbols x1,...,xK. The precoding is a scheme for pre-processing<br>
data symbols to be transmitted. Examples of the precoding scheme include random<br>
beamforming (RBF), zero forcing beamforming (ZFBF), etc., in which input symbols<br>
are generated by applying a weighting vector or a precoding matrix to the data<br>
symbols.<br>
[60] The multiplexer 150 assigns the input symbols x1,...,xK to suitable subcarriers, and<br>
multiplexes the symbols according to a user. The multiplexed symbols are modulated<br>
and then transmitted through the Tx antennas 190-1 to 190-Nt.<br>
[61] FIG. 3 is a block diagram showing a receiver having multiple antennas.<br>
[62] Referring to FIG. 3, a receiver 200 includes a demodulator 210, a channel estimator<br>
220, a post-coder 230, a demapper 240, a channel decoder 250, and a controller 260.<br>
Further, the receiver 200 includes Nr (Nr&gt;1) Rx antennas 290-1 to 290-Nr. The<br>
receiver 200 may be a part of a UE in downlink. The receiver 200 may be a part of a<br>
BS in uplink.<br>
[63] Signals received from the Rx antennas 290-1 to 290-Nr are demodulated by the de-<br>
modulator 210. The channel estimator 220 estimates a channel. The post-coder 230<br>
performs post-coding corresponding to the pre-coding of the precoders 140-1 to 140-K.<br>
The demapper 240 de-maps input symbols into coded data. The channel decoder 250<br>
decodes the coded data to restore original data. The controller 260 feeds back feedback<br>
data to a transmitter. The feedback data includes channel state information (CSI),<br>
channel quality information (CQI), user priority information, etc.<br>
[64] FIG. 4 shows an example of a granularity of a radio resource according to an em-<br>
bodiment of the present invention.<br>
[65] Referring to FIG. 4, user data and control signals are carried and transmitted on a<br>
frame including a plurality of resource blocks. The frame can include a plurality of<br>
OFDM symbols in a time axis and a plurality of resource blocks in a frequency axis.<br>
The resource block is a basic unit of radio resource allocation, and includes a plurality<br>
of contiguous subcarriers. The resource block can include 12 subcarriers. The<br>
subcarrier includes a data subcarrier and a pilot subcarrier. The data subcarrier can<br>
carry the user data and the control signals. The pilot subcarrier can carry common<br>
pilots for respective antennas in the multiple antenna system. The subcarrier and the<br>
pilot subcarrier can be arranged in various patterns in the resource block.<br>
[66] The radio resource can be divided in the frequency domain into a variety of granu-<br>
larities, e.g., a whole-band (WB), a PMI-band (PB), a sub-band (SB), etc. The SB<br>
denotes a frequency band for carrying at least one control signal or user data. The SB<br>
can include at least one resource block. The PB includes at least one SB. The PB<br>
includes SBs having the same or similar PMIs. The WB denotes a whole frequency<br>
band. A size relation of these bands may be SB = PB = WB.<br>
[67] According to feedback data reporting, the radio resource can be divided in the<br>
frequency domain into a best band (BB) and a residual band (RB). The BB denotes a<br>
set of specific SBs selected from a plurality of SBs. The RB denotes a set of SBs<br>
remaining after excluding BBs from the WB. For example, if CQIs are transmitted<br>
using a best-M scheme (M=2), two SBs having greatest CQI values are selected from<br>
all SB CQI values. The selected two SBs are used as BBs, and the remaining SBs are<br>
used as RBs. The CQIs of the two BBs may be transmitted without alteration, and the<br>
CQIs of the RBs may be transmitted in such as manner that CQIs of all SBs corre-<br>
sponding to the RBs are averaged so that the resultant one average value is transmitted.<br>
Alternatively, the CQIs of the two BBs may be averaged so that the resultant average<br>
value is transmitted, and the CQIs of all SBs corresponding to RBs may be averaged so<br>
that the resultant average value is transmitted.<br>
[68] The best-M scheme is for selecting a set of specific M SBs from a plurality of SBs.<br>
In the best-M scheme, a user equipment (UE) can select a most preferred SB and report<br>
the selected SB to a base station (BS). In the best-M scheme, a CQI of the selected SB<br>
can be represented with its original value or may be represented with an average value.<br>
A CQI of the RB can be represented with an average RB CQI or an average WB CQI.<br>
[69] The aforementioned frame structure and the granularity of the radio resource are<br>
provided for exemplary purposes only. Thus, a size of each band and the number of<br>
bands may be variously modified and applied.<br>
[70] The reason of applying a variety of granularities is to reduce an overhead caused by<br>
feedback data and to effectively transmit the feedback data. For example, to provide a<br>
service with good quality of service (QoS) to a plurality of UEs, it is effective to obtain<br>
and transmit CQIs for all SBs. However, since transmission of the CQIs of all SBs<br>
results in increase in the overhead, the UE transmits the CQIs in such as manner that,<br>
as for BBs, some SBs having good CQIs are specified as the BBs and their original<br>
CQIs are transmitted, whereas, as for RBs, only an average value obtained by<br>
averaging the CQIs of the RBs is transmitted.<br>
[71] The PMI is information required for performing precoding and postcoding on user<br>
data. The PMI can be obtained with respect to the SB, the PB, and the WB. The CQI is<br>
calculated based on the PMI and is then quantized. For correct CQI reporting, PMIs for<br>
all SBs have to be transmitted. However, transmission of the PMIs of all SBs results in<br>
increase in an overhead. An unnecessary overhead can be generated according to a size<br>
of the PB even in a case where a PMI for the PB is obtained and transmitted. When the<br>
PMI is obtained and transmitted in the same manner as a CQI transmission method, the<br>
unnecessary overhead can be reduced and correct CQI reporting can be achieved. One<br>
CQI and one PMI can be obtained and transmitted for the WB. The PB may have an<br>
equal or greater size than the BB. A PMI of the PB belonging to the BB can be<br>
transmitted together with a CQI of the BB.<br>
[72] The RI denotes respective independent channels that can be multiplexed by multiple<br>
antennas. The RI can be obtained and transmitted in a WB unit.<br>
[73] Now, a method for transmitting feedback data in a multiple antenna system will be<br>
described.<br>
[74] FIG. 5 shows an example of transmitting a CQI and a PMI. FIG. 6 shows another<br>
example of transmitting a CQI and a PMI. FIG. 7 shows another example of<br>
transmitting a CQI and a PMI.<br>
[75] Referring to FIGs. 5 to 7, a whole frequency band is divided into 9 SBs.<br>
[76] In FIG. 5, a CQI's frequency granularity (FG) is determined to be one SB, and a<br>
PMFs FG is determined to be a WB. Feedback data may consist of CQIs of respective<br>
SBs and a CQI of the WB.<br>
[77] In FIG. 6, a CQI FG is determined to be one SB, and a PMI FG is determined to be<br>
greater than the CQI FG. That is, it can be related as PMI FG = Nx CQI FG (N &gt; 1).<br>
The PMI FG may be determined to be a multiple of the CQI FG. For example, if two<br>
resource blocks are included in the CQI FG, the number of resource blocks included in<br>
the PMI FG can be 4, 6,..., n, where n is a multiple of 2. Once the PMI FG is de-<br>
termined to be a multiple of the CQI FG, it is easy to calculate a CQI determined<br>
according to the PMI. In addition, the PMI can be easily applied. Feedback data may<br>
consist of CQIs of all SBs and a PMI of a PMI FG.<br>
[78] In FIG. 7, a CQI FG is determined to be one SB, and a PMI FG is also determined to<br>
be one SB. That is, the CQI FG and the PMI FG can be determined to have the same<br>
size. Feedback data may consist of CQIs and PMIs of all SBs. When the CQI FG and<br>
the PMI FG are determined to have the same size, accuracy of CQI reporting can<br>
increase. However, the number of PMIs may increase in proportion to the number of<br>
transmitted CQIs. Thus, an overhead caused by the feedback data may also increase.<br>
[79] CQIs can be calculated in various manners as follows.<br>
[80] 1. A CQI for each SB can be calculated by using a PMI for each SB. The PMI for<br>
each SB is referred to as a frequency selective PMI. The CQI for each SB is referred to<br>
as a frequency selective CQI.<br>
[81] 2. The CQI for each SB can be calculated by using a PMI for a WB.<br>
[82] 3. The CQI for each SB belonging to an RB can be calculated by using a PMI for the<br>
RB remaining after excluding a BB selected according to the best-M scheme. A PMI<br>
for the WB or a PMI for the RB is referred to as a frequency flat PMI.<br>
[83] 4. A CQI for each SB belonging to the BB can be calculated by applying the<br>
frequency selective PMI to the BB selected in the best-M scheme, and a CQI for each<br>
SB can be calculated by applying the frequency flat PMI to the SB belonging to the<br>
RB.<br>
[84] 5. An average CQI for a WB can be calculated in the best-M scheme by using a CQI<br>
value in consideration of a BB. An average CQI for a WB or an RB is referred to as a<br>
frequency flat CQI.<br>
[85] 6. An average CQI for an RB in the best-M scheme can be calculated by using a CQI<br>
value without consideration of the BB.<br>
[86] 7. A BB CQI can be represented with a difference value with respect to a WB CQI in<br>
the best-M scheme, and an average CQI can be calculated using the RB and the<br>
difference value. The CQI average can be used as a CQI average for the RB or the<br>
WB.<br>
[87] When a CQI applied with the frequency selective PMI is included in CQI calculation,<br>
the average CQI can be increased as a whole. When the number of UEs is small, the<br>
RB other than the reported BB may also be allocated to the UEs. Since an RB CQI is<br>
reported to be a great value, a high MCS level can be selected and thus throughput can<br>
be improved.<br>
[88] FIG. 8 shows a method for generating feedback data according to an embodiment of<br>
the present invention.<br>
[89] Referring to FIG. 8, a WB is divided into a plurality of SBs. A UE can obtain a CQI<br>
for each SB. The WB includes 7 SBs. It is assumed herein that a 6th SB and a 7th SB are<br>
BBs selected from the 7 SBs. That is, two SBs having greatest CQI values are selected<br>
in the best-M scheme (M=2). The number of the selected SBs is provided for<br>
exemplary purposes only, and thus the present invention is not limited to the afore-<br>
mentioned number.<br>
[90] Feedback data includes various types of control signals. Table 1 below shows an<br>
example of the types of control signals.<br>
[91] Table 1<br>
<br>
[92] In Table 1 above, 'bitmap' is an indicator for specifying an SB selected from a<br>
plurality of SBs. M SBs may be selected and specified with a bitmap in the best-M<br>
scheme. For example, 7 SBs can be represented with a 7-bit bitmap, and a 6th SB and a<br>
7th SB selected from the 7 SBs can be specified as '0000011'. When N BB CQIs<br>
selected from N SBs are transmitted or when a WB CQI is transmitted in the best-M<br>
scheme, a bitmap may not be transmitted.<br>
[93] 'RT is provided for the WB and may be included in the feedback data.<br>
[94] 'CQI' is provided for each SB selected as a BB and is also provided for a BB or an<br>
RB. The CQI may be included in the feedback data.<br>
[95] 'PMI' is provided for each SB selected as a BB and is also provided for a value for a<br>
BB or an RB. The PMI may be included in the feedback data.<br>
[96] It is assumed that 'CQI' and 'PMI' are included in the feedback data with the same<br>
granularity. In the best-M scheme, the feedback data may include a BB CQI or an RB<br>
CQI. The feedback data may include a BB PMI or an RB PMI. The BB CQI may be a<br>
CQI for each SB belonging to the BB or may be one average CQI for BBs. The RB<br>
CQI may be an average CQI of SBs belonging to the RB. The BB PMI may be a PMI<br>
of each SB belonging to the BB or may be one PMI for BBs.<br>
[97] In Type 'A', a CQI includes a first BB (BB #1) CQI, a second BB (BB #2) CQI, and<br>
an RB CQI. A PMI includes a BB #1 PMI, a BB #2 PMI, and an RB PMI.<br>
[98] In Type 'B', a CQI includes an average CQI of BB #1 and BB #2 and an RB CQI. A<br>
PMI includes a BB #1 PMI, a BB #2 PMI, and an RB PMI.<br>
[99] In Type 'A-1', a CQI includes a BB #1 CQI and a BB #2 CQI. A PMI includes one<br>
PMI for both BB #1 and BB #2 and an RB PMI.<br>
[100] In Type 'B-1', a CQI includes an average CQI of BB # 1 and BB #2 and an RB CQI.<br>
A PMI includes one PMI for both BB #1 and BB #2 and an RB PMI.<br>
[101] FIG. 9 shows a method for generating feedback data according to another em-<br>
bodiment of the present invention.<br>
[102] Referring to FIG. 9, a WB includes 7 SBs. It is assumed herein that a 6th SB and a 7th<br>
SB are BBs selected from the 7 SBs. That is, two SBs having greatest CQIs are<br>
selected in the best-M scheme (M=2).<br>
[ 103] Table 2 below shows an example of various types of feedback data.<br>
[104] Table 2<br>
<br>
[105] In the best-M scheme, the feedback data can include a BB CQI and a WB CQI. The<br>
feedback data can also include a BB PMI and a WB PMI. The BB CQI may be CQIs<br>
of all SBs belonging to the BB or may be one average BB CQI. The WB CQI may be<br>
an average WB CQI. The BB PMI may be PMIs of all SBs belonging to the BB or may<br>
be one PMI for BBs.<br>
[106] In Type 'C, a CQI includes a BB #1 CQI, a BB #2 CQI, and a WB CQI. A PMI<br>
includes a BB #1 PMI, a BB #2 PMI, and a WB PMI.<br>
[107] In Type 'D', a CQI includes an average CQI of BB #1 and BB #2 CQI and a WB<br>
CQI. A PMI includes a BB #1 PMI, a BB #2 PMI, and a WB PMI.<br>
[108] In Type 'C-l', a CQI includes a BB #1 CQI and a BB #2 CQI. A PMI includes one<br>
PMI for BBs #1 and #2 and a WB PMI.<br>
[109] In Type 'D-1', a CQI includes an average CQI of BB #1 and BB #1 and a WB CQI. A<br>
PMI includes one PMI for BBs #1 and #2 and a WB PMI. A user equipment (UE)<br>
selects M SBs from a plurality of SBs, and reports to a base station (BS) one PMI and<br>
one CQI for the selected SBs (i.e., BBs). Herein, one PMI for the selected M SBs<br>
indicates an index of one precoding matrix selected from a codebook set used when<br>
transmission is made through the selected M SBs. One CQI for the selected M SBs<br>
uses the precoding matrix used in the selected M SBs. A difference value with respect<br>
to the WB CQI can be used as a CQI value for the selected M SBs. The UE reports to<br>
the BS a WB PMI and a WB CQI for a WB including a plurality of SBs. The WB PMI<br>
indicates an index of a precoding matrix selected from a codebook for all of the<br>
plurality of SBs. The WB CQI indicates a CQI value for all of the plurality of SBs.<br>
[110] The types of control signals described in Table 1 and Table 2 above can be used in<br>
combination with each other. For example, CQIs transmitted through the feedback data<br>
may be the average BB CQI and the WB CQI, and PMIs transmitted through the<br>
feedback data may be the BB PMI and the RB PMI.<br>
[111] A scheme for transmitting the WB PMI or the RB PMI is referred to as a PMI com-<br>
pression scheme.<br>
[112] As described above, when a CQI is obtained for an SB in transmission, a PMI is<br>
obtained for the same SB and is then transmitted. In addition, when one CQI is<br>
obtained for an RB or a WB in transmission, one PMI is obtained for the RB and the<br>
WB and is then transmitted. The UE transmits the CQI and the PMI by using the same<br>
granularity value, thereby reducing an overhead caused by feedback data.<br>
[113] The aforementioned description is for exemplary purposes only, and thus the present<br>
invention is not limited thereto. For example, only a BB CQI may be transmitted<br>
without transmitting a WB CQI or an RB CQI, and as a result, only a BB PMI may be<br>
transmitted.<br>
[114] Table 3 blow shows another example of various types of feedback data. This is a case<br>
where only an SB CQI and an SB PMI are transmitted.<br>
[115] Table 3<br>
<br>
[116] In Type 'E', a CQI includes a BB #1 CQI and a BB #2 CQI. A PMI includes all of<br>
each SB PMIs oraWB PMI.<br>
[117] In Type 'F', a CQI includes a BB #1 CQI and a BB #2 CQI. A PMI includes a BB #1<br>
PMI and a BB #2 PMI.<br>
[118] In Type 'G', a CQI includes a BB #1 CQI and a BB #2 CQI. A PMI includes one PMI<br>
for both BB#1 and BB#2.<br>
[119] In Type 'H', a CQI includes an average CQI for both BB #1 and BB #2. A PMI<br>
includes one PMI for both BB #1 and BB #2.<br>
[120] Table 4 below shows another example of various types of feedback data. This is a<br>
case where only a WB CQI and a WB PMI are transmitted.<br>
[121] Table 4<br>
<br>
[122] Since the WB CQI and the WB PMI are transmitted, bitmap information is not<br>
required.<br>
[123] In Type T, a CQI is a WB CQI, and a PMI is a WB PMI. In Type 'J', rank in-<br>
formation is not given. A CQI is a WB CQI, and a PMI is a WB PMI.<br>
[124] A granularity of a PMI-band (PB) can be determined variously according to a type of<br>
feedback data.<br>
[125] A PB may have the same granularity as an SB or may have a granularity greater than<br>
the SB and less than a WB. The PB may be variable. The granularity of the PB can be<br>
determined as follows.<br>
[126] (1) Smallest PMI Band (S-PB)<br>
[127] The PB has the same granularity as the SB (i.e., PB=SB): (a) The granularity of the<br>
PB can be determined to be the same granularity as SBs for M CQIs.<br>
[128] (2) Middle PMI Band; (M-PB)<br>
[129] The PB has a granularity greater by an integer multiple number than the SB (i.e.,<br>
SB<pb the granularity of pb can be determined to have size></pb>
contiguous SBs for M CQIs; (b) When M average CQIs are transmitted, M SBs can be<br>
determined as the PB; and (c) (N-M) SBs which are non-selected bands among N SBs<br>
can be determined as the PB.<br>
[130] (3) Largest PMI Band (L-PB)<br>
[131] The PB has the same granularity as the WB (i.e., PB=WB): (a) The granularity of the<br>
PB can be determined to have the same granularity as the WB.<br>
[132] Now, a granularity of a PB according to a reporting type of feedback data will be<br>
described.<br>
[133] If the reporting type of feedback data is 'A' or 'B' of Table 1 above, the granularity of<br>
the PB for an SB CQI can be S-PB, M-PB(a), or M-PB(b). The granularity of the PB<br>
for an RB CQI can be M-PB(c).<br>
[134] If the reporting type of feedback data is 'C or 'D' of Table 2 above, the granularity of<br>
the PB for the SB CQI can be S-PB, M-PB(a), or M-PB(b). The granularity of the PB<br>
for a WB CQI can be M-PB(c) or L-PB. In addition, when the number M of selected<br>
bands is equal to the number N of all SBs, the granularity of the PB for the SB CQI can<br>
be S-PB, and the granularity of the PB for an average WB CQI can be L-PB.<br>
[135] If the reporting type of feedback data is 'E', 'F, 'G', or 'H' of Table 3 above, the<br>
granularity of the PB for the SB CQI can be S-PB, M-PB(a), or M-PB(b). Further, the<br>
granularity of the PB for the WB can be M-PB(c) or L-PB.<br>
[136] If the reporting type of feedback data is T or 'J' of Table 4 above, the granularity of<br>
the PB for the WB CQI can be L-PB.<br>
[137] FIGs. 10 to 12 show a method for transmitting feedback data according to an em-<br>
bodiment of the present invention. More specifically, FIG. 10 shows a case of<br>
transmitting a WB PMI, FIG. 11 shows a case of transmitting a PMI for a PMI FG<br>
having a greater size than a CQI FG, and FIG. 12 shows a case of transmitting a PMI<br>
for a PMI FG having the same size as the CQI FG.<br>
[138] Referring to FIGs. 10 to 12, an uplink overhead can be reduced when one PMI is<br>
transmitted for a WB. In this case, a CQI to be transmitted may include a BB (i.e., BB<br>
#1 and BB #2) CQI and a WB CQI or may include a BB CQI and an RB CQI.<br>
[139] When the PMI FG has a size two times higher than the CQI FG, one PMI (i.e., PMI<br>
#A) may be transmitted for the BBs #1 and #2 having greatest CQI levels, and two<br>
PMIs (i.e., PMIs #C and #F) may be transmitted for RBs #3 to #5. Although the WB<br>
PMI is transmitted in this case, the uplink overhead can be reduced when the PMI FG<br>
is determined to have a greater size than the CQI FG. When the PMI is represented in 4<br>
bits, resources of 12 bits are used to transmit the PMI. In this case, a CQI to be<br>
transmitted may include a BB (i.e., BB #1 and BB #2) CQI and a WB CQI or may<br>
include a BB CQI and an RB CQI.<br>
[140] When the PMI FG and the CQI FG have the same size, the PMI #A and the PMI #B<br>
of the respective BBs #1 and #2 and the PMI #C and the PMI #F of the respective RBs<br>
#3 and #5 can be transmitted. Although data throughput can increase in this case, the<br>
uplink overhead may significantly increase. When the PMI is represented in 4 bits,<br>
resources of 24 bits are used to transmit 6 PMIs. In this case, a CQI to be transmitted<br>
may include a BB (i.e., BB #1 and BB #2) CQI and a WB CQI or may include a BB<br>
CQI and an RB CQI.<br>
[141] The aforementioned number of SBs and BBs for generating feedback data can vary<br>
variously. The size and the number of PBs also can vary variously. PMIs can be<br>
transmitted in various manners. For example, a BB PMI and a WB PMI can be<br>
transmitted, or only PMIs for some BBs selected from a plurality of BBs can be<br>
transmitted.<br>
[142] Now, a method for transmitting PMIs of some SBs (i.e., BBs) instead of transmitting<br>
all PMIs of a whole frequency band will be described.<br>
[143] FIGs. 13 and 14 show a method for transmitting feedback data according to another<br>
embodiment of the present invention. This is a case where a PMI FG is greater in size<br>
than a CQI FG (i.e., PMI FG = N x CQI FG (N &gt; 1)).<br>
[144] Referring to FIGs 13 and 14, a PMI of a BB having a high CQI is transmitted, and a<br>
PMI of an RB is additionally transmitted when necessary. This is referred to as a BB<br>
PMI scheme. PMIs of respective PBs belonging to the BB are transmitted, and then an<br>
RB PMI or a WB PMI can be transmitted. The number of PMIs to be transmitted by a<br>
UE may be determined according to the number of BBs and a ratio of a CQI FG to a<br>
PMI FG.<br>
[145] It is assumed that the PMI FG has a size two times higher than the CQI FG, and two<br>
SBs are selected as BBs (i.e., M=2). In FIG. 13, the selected BBs are included in one<br>
PMI FG. The number of PMIs to be transmitted by the UE is one. In FIG. 14, the<br>
selected two BBs are included in different PMI FGs. The number of PMIs to be<br>
transmitted by the UE is two. The UE may transmit a WB PMI(2) along with a PMI(l)<br>
of a PB belonging to the BB, or may transmit an RB PMI(3).<br>
[146] FIGs. 15 and 16 show a method for transmitting feedback data according to another<br>
embodiment of the present invention. This is a case where a PMI FG and a CQI FG<br>
have the same size.<br>
[147] Referring to FIGs. 15 and 16, when the PMI FG and the CQI FG have the same size,<br>
one PMI is assigned for one CQI. When the CQI and the PMI are reported in the best-<br>
M scheme, the CQI and the PMI can be reported with one bitmap. A UE may transmit<br>
a WB PMI(2) together with a BB PMI(l) or may transmit an RB PMI(3).<br>
[148] When the BB PMI is transmitted together with the WB (or RB) PMI, a band applied<br>
with each PMI can be known by using the reported CQI. For example, when the UE<br>
reports a BB CQI by selecting M BBs, the UE can report the BB PMI together with the<br>
BB CQI. In this case, an index indicating a BB in CQI reporting can also be used<br>
without alternation in PMI reporting.<br>
[149] Even when applying the PMI FG and the CQI FG having different sizes, a band<br>
applied with a PMI reported through the index indicating the BB can be known. The<br>
UE may report control signals, for example, CQI1,..., CQIM, CQIAverage, BitMap, PMI,,<br>
..., PMIL, and PMIAvenige (M&gt;L). When an average PMI (i.e., PMIAverage) is located in a<br>
last position of a reported area, information on remaining PMIs other than the average<br>
PMI is sequentially used as information on BB PMIs.<br>
[150] Herein, "CQI1,..., CQIM, CQIAverage, BitMap" is an expression in consideration of CQI<br>
compression of the best-M scheme. A PMI compression scheme can be used along<br>
with any CQI compression schemes. For example, if the UE compresses CQI in-<br>
formation of each SB by using discrete cosine transform (DCT) and transmits the<br>
compressed CQI information, the BS can know each SB CQI according to com-<br>
pression information. Accordingly, a position of a BB can be known, and the position<br>
of the BB is a position applied with a BB PMI.<br>
[151] FIGs. 17 to 20 show a method for transmitting feedback data according to another<br>
embodiment of the present invention. This is a case where a PMI FG has a size two<br>
times higher than a CQI FG, and two BBs having high CQIs are selected (i.e., M=2).<br>
[152] Referring to FIGs. 17 to 20, in FIG. 17, when BBs #1 and #2 are included in one PMI<br>
FG, a UE transmits one PMI #A for the BBs #1 and #2 and a PMI #G for a WB. In this<br>
case, the UE may transmit CQIs of the BBs #1 and #2 and an average WB CQI.<br>
[153] In FIG. 18, when the BBs #1 and #2 are included in one PMI FG, the UE transmits<br>
one PMI #A for the BBs #1 and #2 and a PMI #H for an RB. In this case, the UE may<br>
transmit CQIs of the BBs #1 and #2 and an RB CQI.<br>
[154] In FIG. 19, when the BBs #1 and #3 are included in different PMI FGs, the UE<br>
transmits PMIs #A and #C for the respective PMI FGs and a PMI #G for a WB. In this<br>
case, the UE may transmit CQIs of the BBs #1 and #3 and an average WB CQI.<br>
[155] In FIG. 20, when the BBs #1 and #3 are included in different PMI FGs, the UE<br>
transmits PMIs #A and #C for the respective PMI FGs and a PMI #G for an RB. In this<br>
case, the UE may transmit CQIs of the BBs #1 and #3 and an RB CQI.<br>
[156] FIGs. 21 to 24 show a method for transmitting feedback data according to another<br>
embodiment of the present invention. This is a case where a PMIFG and a CQI FG<br>
have the same size, and two BBs having high CQIs are selected (i.e., M=2).<br>
[157] Referring to FIGs. 21 to 24, in FIG. 21, a UE transmits PMIs #A and #B for re-<br>
spective BBs #1 and #2 and a PMI #G for a WB. In this case, the UE may transmit<br>
CQIs of the BBs #1 and #2 and an average WB CQI.<br>
[158] In FIG. 22, the UE transmits PMIs #A and #B for respective BBs #1 and #2 and a<br>
PMI #H for an RB. In this case, the UE may transmit CQIs of the BBs #1 and #2 and<br>
an RB CQI.<br>
[159] In FIG. 23, the PMI FG and the CQI FG have the same size even if selected BBs are<br>
not contiguous to each other. Thus, the UE can transmit PMIs #A and #C for re-<br>
spective BBs #1 and #3 and a PMI #H for an RB. In this case, the UE may transmit<br>
CQIs of the BBs #1 and #3 and an RB CQI.<br>
[160] In FIG. 24, even if selected BBs are not contiguous to each other, the UE can<br>
transmit PMIs #A and #C for respective BBs #1 and #3 and a PMI #G for a WB. In<br>
this case, the UE may transmit CQIs of the BBs #1 and #3 and a WB CQI.<br>
[161] When a BB PMI and a WB PMI are transmitted or when a BB PMI and an RB PMI<br>
are transmitted, the following gain can be obtained.<br>
[162] 1. If a CQI FG and a PMI FG have the same size, a granularity applied to a PMI is<br>
the same as that applied to a CQI. Thus, the PMI and the CQI can be easily mapped.<br>
[163] 2. If the CQI FG and the PMI FG have different sizes, the following is applied. (1)<br>
The PMI and the CQI can be more easily mapped when the PMI FG and the CQI FG<br>
have a multiple relation than when the PMI FG and the CQI FG have a relatively prime<br>
relation. (2) It is easy to use a PMI compression scheme together with a CQI com-<br>
pression scheme when the PMI FG has a larger size than the CQI FG and has a<br>
multiple relation to the CQI FG. That is, a BB PMI transmission method and a BB CQI<br>
transmission method can be easily used. (3) When some of PMIs are to be transmitted,<br>
there is a need to inform which SB PMIs are transmitted. For example, selected SBs<br>
may be informed using a bitmap. Alternatively, in case of a PMI for an SB applied<br>
with a best-M CQI, the PMI can be used by searching for information indicating a<br>
position of a BB CQI.<br>
[164] FIGs. 25 to 27 show a method for transmitting feedback data according to another<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[165] Referring to FIGs. 25 to 27, a CQI and a PMI can be transmitted by configuring a<br>
PMI FG to have a larger size than a CQI FG and by selecting contiguous BBs included<br>
in one PMI FG.<br>
[166] To allow the contiguous BBs to be included in one PMI FG, the following is carried<br>
out. (1) A PMI-band (PB) including an SB having a good channel condition is<br>
obtained. The PMI-band includes at least one SB and at least one CQTband. (2) M<br>
BBs are selected from the obtained PMI-band. The BB is a CQI-band including at least<br>
one SB. (3) CQIs of the BBs selected from one PMI FG are obtained. (4) A BB CQI<br>
and a WB (or RB) CQI are transmitted. (5) A PMI of a PMI-band including the BBs<br>
. and a PMI of a WB (or RB) are transmitted. The number of transmitted PMIs is de-<br>
termined according to a value M given in the best-M scheme. The number of reporting<br>
PMIs can be determined according to the value M as follows.<br>
[167] <br>
[168] Herein, N = PMI FG / CQI FG. The PMI FG can be determined to be a multiple of<br>
the CQI FG. That is, the number of SBs belonging to the PMI-band is a multiple of the<br>
number of SBs included in the BB (i.e., CQI-band). M may be a default value or may<br>
be determined by a BS and reported to a UE. When the number of reporting PMIs is<br>
determined according to the determined M, feedback data reported by the UE to the BS<br>
can be determined in a specific format. In addition, a bitmap indicating the BB can be<br>
reused as a bitmap indicating the PMI-band. When the feedback data transmitted by<br>
the UE is determined to the specific format, the BS can avoid a complex process such<br>
as blind decoding, thereby increasing system efficiency.<br>
[169] In FIG. 25, PMIs #A and #B of a PMI FG corresponding to randomly selected BBs<br>
and a PMI #C of an RB are transmitted. CQIs to be transmitted include a BB CQI and<br>
a WB CQI. The WB CQI may be an average CQI for a plurality of BBs. Instead of the<br>
WB CQI, an RB CQI may be transmitted. There is no particular overhead reduction.<br>
[170] In FIG. 26, when contiguous BBs are selected and the selected BBs are included in<br>
one PMI FG, one PMI #A for the BBs and PMIs #B and #C for RBs can be<br>
transmitted. When only the PMIs for the BBs are transmitted, an overhead can be<br>
reduced.<br>
[171] In FIG. 27, when contiguous BBs are selected and the selected BBs are included in<br>
one PMI FG, one PMI #A for the BBs and a PMI #D for an RB can be transmitted. An<br>
overhead caused by PMI transmission can be further reduced. As such, when feedback<br>
data is transmitted by configuring the PMI FG to be larger than the CQI FG and by<br>
selecting contiguous BBs included in one PMI FG, an overhead caused by feedback<br>
data transmission can be reduced.<br>
[172] FIG. 28 is a graph showing an example of a data efficiency ratio when an uplink PMI<br>
is transmitted. FIG. 29 is a graph showing another example of a data efficiency ratio<br>
when an uplink PMI is transmitted. Four BBs are selected in FIG. 28 (i.e., M=4 in the<br>
best-M scheme). Six BBs are selected in FIG. 29 (i.e., M=6 in the best-M scheme).<br>
[173] Referring to FIGs. 28 and 29, "(a) Scheme 1" is a case where a PMI is transmitted as<br>
shown in FIG. 25. "(b) Scheme 2" is a case where a PMI is transmitted as shown in<br>
FIG. 26. "(c) Scheme 3" is a case where a PMI is transmitted as shown in FIG. 27.<br>
[174] In "Scheme 3", one PMI is transmitted by selecting contiguous BBs and then an RB<br>
PMI is transmitted (i.e., a PMI compression scheme). In terms of data efficiency, the<br>
use of this scheme shows almost the same result as in a case of transmitting all PMIs.<br>
That it, an overhead caused by control signal transmission can be reduced while<br>
maintaining system performance.<br>
[175] FIG. 30 is a flowchart showing a method for generating feedback data according to<br>
an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[176] Referring to FIG. 30, a BS requests a UE to report feedback data through a downlink<br>
channel (step S110). The feedback data report request can be transmitted using a<br>
request message. The request message may include uplink scheduling information for<br>
channel condition reporting and also include information on a frame offset, a reporting<br>
type of the feedback data, a transmission period of the feedback data, etc. The uplink<br>
scheduling information indicates feedback data transmission and uplink radio resource<br>
assignment. The request message may be transmitted through a physical downlink<br>
control channel (PDCCH).<br>
[177] The UE generates the feedback data (step S120). The UE extracts channel in-<br>
formation from a downlink signal. The channel information may include channel state<br>
information (CSI), channel quality information (CQI), user priority information, etc.<br>
By using the channel information, the UE selects M SBs from a plurality of SBs<br>
according to a channel condition between the UE and the BS. The M SBs may be<br>
selected from the plurality of SBs according to a CQI value of each SB. The UE<br>
generates the feedback data according to a reporting type of the feedback data. The<br>
reporting type may be determined by the BS or may be predetermined by default. For<br>
example, the feedback data may include a frequency selective PMI, a frequency flat<br>
PMI, a BB CQI, and a WB CQI. The feedback data may further include a bitmap and<br>
an RI. The bitmap indicates positions of the selected M SBs. The RI corresponds to the<br>
number of useful transmission layers. The BB CQI and the WB CQI may be calculated<br>
for each transmission layer. A CQI reporting type may vary according to each layer.<br>
[178] The UE reports the feedback data to the BS through an uplink channel (step S130).<br>
The UE transmits the feedback data by using an uplink radio resource allocated<br>
according to uplink scheduling information. The uplink radio resource may be a<br>
physical uplink shared channel (PUSCH).<br>
[179] The BS performs radio resource scheduling by using the feedback data received from<br>
the UE. Errors may occur in the feedback data in the process of transmitting the<br>
feedback data. The feedback data transmitted by the UE may not be correctly decoded<br>
by the BS, and in this case, the frequency selective PMI cannot be used. Regarding a<br>
PMI included in the feedback data, the UE selects a PMI which can be best fit to its<br>
channel condition. In terms of improvement of quality of service (QoS), it is preferable<br>
that the BS allocates radio resources by using the PMI included in the feedback data.<br>
[180] FIG. 31 is a flowchart showing a method for selecting a PMI by detecting an error<br>
from feedback data according to an embodiment of the present invention. It is assumed<br>
herein that a UE transmits feedback data to a BS by using the best-M scheme, wherein<br>
the feedback data includes an SB PMI and a WB PMI (or RB PMI).<br>
[181] Referring to FIG. 31, the BS receives the feedback data from the UE (step S210).<br>
The feedback data may include a bitmap indicating a BB selected according to the<br>
best-M scheme, a PMI of an SB belonging to the BB, and a PMI of an RB (or a WB).<br>
[182] The BS detects an error of the bitmap from the feedback data transmitted by the UE<br>
(step S220). Due to noise or fading, the feedback data may not be correctly decoded<br>
when it is transmitted from the UE to the BS.<br>
[183] If there is no error in the bitmap, the BS applies the SB PMI transmitted by the UE<br>
(step S230). That is, the BS assigns to the UE at least one SB selected by the UE from<br>
the BBs. In addition, for a PMI of the assigned SB, the BS applies the SB PMI<br>
transmitted by the UE.<br>
[184] Otherwise, if there is an error in the bitmap, the BS applies the WB PMI or the RB<br>
PMI (step S240). Since the BS cannot know the BBs due to the bitmap error, the BS<br>
cannot use the SB PMI transmitted by the UE. The BS allocates radio resources to the<br>
UE according to the WB PMI or the RB PMI transmitted by the UE. The BS reports to<br>
the UE a PMI currently in use together with radio resource assignment information by<br>
using a downlink control signal.<br>
[185] Since the BS can adaptively select a PMI to be used in radio resources according to a<br>
result of detecting errors from feedback data, QoS of wireless communication can be<br>
improved.<br>
[186] Every function as described above can be performed by a processor such as a micro-<br>
processor based on software coded to perform such function, a program code, etc., a<br>
controller, a micro-controller, an ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit), or the<br>
like. Planning, developing and implementing such codes may be obvious for the skilled<br>
person in the art based on the description of the present invention.<br>
[187] Although the embodiments of the present invention have been disclosed for il-<br>
lustrative purposes, those skilled in the art will appreciate that various modifications,<br>
additions and substitutions are possible, without departing from the scope of the<br>
invention. Accordingly, the embodiments of the present invention are not limited to the<br>
above-described embodiments but are defined by the claims which follow, along with<br>
their full scope of equivalents.<br>
