				<td>DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention concerns a reactive atmosphere or gaseous composition and a method of<br>
application of the same in processes for the continuous and/or discontinuous solid phase<br>
polymerisation of polyester.<br>
More precisely, the invention concerns a reactive atmosphere or gaseous composition<br>
applicable in processes for the continuous and/or discontinuous solid phase polymerisation<br>
of polyester in order to increase its molecular weight.<br>
It is known that the molecular weight of a polyester can be evaluated by the measure of its<br>
intrinsic viscosity IV ("Intrinsic Viscosity").<br>
It is also known that the increase of the molecular weight of a polyester can be achieved<br>
by subjecting low molecular weight polyesters, preferably under granular or chip form, to<br>
a solid phase polymerisation process that can be carried out in a reactor of the static bed<br>
type (so-called because the polymer bed is not fluidised) or of the continuous moving bed<br>
type or of the fluidised bed type (this latter only if the granules size is as small as to allow<br>
it) or of the stirred bed type, having a substantially cylindrical/tubular or parallelepipedal<br>
shape, vertical or horizontal, in case rotary and slightly inclined.<br>
Moving bed or static bed solid phase polymerisation processes, particulaR1y intended for<br>
polyethylene terephthalate (PET), wherein temperatures comprised in the range 180-245<br>
°C are applied, are known, for instance, from US 3,405,098, US 4,064,112, US 4,161,578,<br>
US 4,223,128, US 4,238,593, US 5,408,035, US 5,536,810, US 5,590,479, US 5,708,124,<br>
EP 0 222 714 and from publications WO 2004/018541 and WO 2004/058852 in the name<br>
of the applicant.<br>
According to the teaching of the above-mentioned documents, the solid phase<br>
polymerisation is preceded by a crystallisation step that can be carried out at a lower<br>
temperature (see, for instance, US 3,405,098, US 4,161,578 and US 4,223,128), at the<br>
same temperature (see, for instance, EP 0 222 714) or at a higher temperature (see, for<br>
2<br><br>
instance, US 4,064,112) with respect to the temperature applied in the following<br>
polymerisation thermal treatment.<br>
The purpose of the crystallisation step prior to the solid phase polymerisation is to prevent<br>
the sticking of the granules during the polymerisation process, especially at the highest<br>
temperatures.<br>
Always according to the teaching of the above-mentioned documents, the reaction of solid<br>
phase polymerisation (as also all the other process steps occurring at temperatures higher<br>
than about 160 °C), in any of the nowadays commercially available processes, occurs in a<br>
purging gas flow, said purging gas preferably consisting of an inert atmosphere (for<br>
instance, nitrogen, helium, noble gases, carbon dioxide, etc.) or, alternatively, of air<br>
(mixture 21%/79% by volume of oxygen/nitrogen) at temperatures lower than the thermal<br>
level generating reactions of oxidative degradation with consequent depression of the<br>
optical properties of the polyester and/or at low moisture content, always for preventing<br>
degradative reaction of the hydrolysis type; according to the known art, the purging gas is<br>
mainly useful for removing the unwanted by-products such as glycols, 1,4 dioxane,<br>
dioxolane, water and acetaldehyde that are produced during the polymerisation.<br>
It is also known the use of an inert gas flow, in case containing reactive molecules, in the<br>
crystallisation step preceding the solid phase polymerisation. For instance, the<br>
International Patent application WO 03/078502 discloses a process of production of<br>
modified thermoplastic polyesters, wherein the polymeric matrix is modified in order to<br>
achieve a variation of the crystallisation behaviour.<br>
Such process provides an initial step of contact between the thermoplastic polyester at the<br>
solid state and an inert gas containing at least an amino group known for the property of<br>
being a nucleating agent of crystallisation (preferably, primary amines -NH2) and,<br>
optionally, a reactive functional group selected among, for instance, anhydrides,<br>
isocyanates, epoxides and oxoazolines.<br>
US 3,953,404 discloses a process for producing poly(l,4-butylene terephthalate) through<br>
solid state polymerisation carried out in the presence of an inert atmosphere containing a<br>
3<br><br>
minor amount of 1,4-butanediol, said poly(l,4-butylene terephthalate) having a high melt<br>
viscosity but without formation of insoluble and infusible gel particles on the outer<br>
surfaces, or "skin", of the molecules.<br>
US 4,387,213 discloses a process for producing highly viscous linear polyalkylene<br>
terephthalates by treating with alkanediols and then condensing in the solid phase, at an<br>
elevated temperature and in an inert gas stream.<br>
US 5,393,871 discloses a process for producing linear polyesters wherein a precursor<br>
polyester is formed into particles and further polymerised in the solid state, said precursor<br>
polyester particles being contacted with the vapour of water or of an organic compound<br>
having one or more hydroxyl groups.<br>
WO 00/49065 discloses a process for the addition of volatile materials, such as catalysts or<br>
treatment agents, to pre-polymers prior to or during solid state polymerisation processes of<br>
condensation polymers.<br>
US 4,590,259 discloses a process for increasing the molecular weight of solid linear<br>
poly(alkylene terephthalates) containing a minor amount of esterification catalyst by<br>
contacting at least one polyester, in the form of particles, with a mixture of an inert gas<br>
and at least one aliphatic diol in the gaseous state and then solid state polymerising.<br>
JP 2004-123917 discloses a process for manufacturing a high-quality polyester resin<br>
having a low cyclic trimer content at a high polymerisation rate by producing a polyester<br>
pre-polymer, heat treating said pre-polymer in a gas mixture containing an inert gas and<br>
water and/or ethylene glycol and then solid state polymerising.<br>
In other words, in any of the today commercially available processes, no component of the<br>
purging gas stream actively takes part in the reaction of solid phase polymerisation, and no<br>
component of said purging gas stream cooperates to perform the required molecular<br>
weight increase, and therefore it is customary to say that the process of solid phase<br>
polymerisation occurs in "inert atmosphere".<br>
4<br><br>
Outstanding aspects of the solid phase polymerisation processes are described hereinafter.<br>
Firstly, a steady and uninterrupted flow of polyester granules must be maintained. As a<br>
consequence, it is highly important that agglomeration and sticking of polyester granules<br>
are avoided, since they would impede the smooth flow of granules and they would make<br>
difficult the discharge of the product from the reactor, thereby causing the loss of plant<br>
control.<br>
Secondly, a suitable combination of residence time and temperature of granules in the<br>
reactor is required to achieve the wanted molecular weight, which is measurable, as<br>
previously indicated, in terms of intrinsic viscosity IV. Since the reaction rate increases<br>
with temperature increase, and IV increases with residence time increase in the reactor,<br>
wanted IV can be attained either by using a relatively long residence time, in combination<br>
with a relatively low temperature, or a relatively short residence time in combination with<br>
a relatively high temperature. However, the ideal combination of residence time and<br>
temperature must be chosen taking into account the first requisite indicated above, i.e. the<br>
need to maintain a linear flow, thereby avoiding the formation of granules agglomeration<br>
and the sticking phenomenon.<br>
Thirdly, the flow regime of the polyester granules processed inside the solid phase<br>
polymerisation reactor is required to be as close as possible to the ideal plug-flow<br>
behaviour. This way all the polyester granules passing inside the reactor undergo the same<br>
processing conditions and a narrow molecular weight distribution in the obtained product<br>
and, more in general, a narrow distribution of polymerised granules final characteristics,<br>
which is a key factor for the correct performance during the subsequent steps in the<br>
manufacturing of the product having increased molecular weight, will be achieved.<br>
A well designed solid phase polymerisation industrial scale plant must be capable of<br>
continuously producing products having intrinsic viscosity IV in compliance with the<br>
required specifications at a sufficiently high throughput. The currently used plants (for<br>
instance Buehler, UOP-Sinco, Hosokawa-Bepex, Zimmer) employ single vertical<br>
cylindrical reactors 10 to 40 meters high or multiple reactors, always vertical. In those<br>
plants the reactor is operated at a temperature comprised between 200 to 230 °C and at a<br>
granules moving velocity comprised between 1.00 to 2.52 meters per hour. Among these<br>
5<br><br>
ranges of temperature, bed height and granules velocity, the choice to achieve a product<br>
with the wanted IV can be made. These conventional currently used plants allow to<br>
produce polyethylene terephthalate (PET) resins having an IV of 0.72 to 0.86 dl/g, using<br>
PET pre-polymers with an IV comprised between 0.55 and 0.65 dl/g. These conventional<br>
plants can therefore increase the polymer IV by about 0.12-0.25 dl/g.<br>
For some specific applications, such as for instance the manufacturing of<br>
technical/industrial articles (luggage, cords, conveyor belts, etc.) wherein PET with IV<br>
comprised between 0.95 and 1.05 dl/g is used or the manufacturing of tyre cords starting<br>
from PET pre-polymers with a typical IV comprised between 0.55 and 0.65 dl/g or still the<br>
manufacturing of standard bottles where the initial IV of the pre-polymer is 0.25-0.45 dl/g,<br>
it is necessary however to increase IV by more than 0.25 dl/g.<br>
This result can hardly be achieved and it often can not be achieved in a conventional plant<br>
using vertical reactors.<br>
In a conventional process, there are two ways to raise product IV: increasing the reactor<br>
temperature or increasing the residence time of granules in the reactor.<br>
The residence time in the reactor is constrained by bed height and granules velocity; it can<br>
be increased by either increasing the bed height or by decreasing the granules velocity.<br>
Increasing the reactor diameter allows an increase in the throughput rate, but not in the<br>
residence time at constant granule velocity.<br>
On the other hand, if the reactor temperature is raised to increase the final product IV,<br>
polymer sticking tendency will consequently increase. To prevent polymer sticking, bed<br>
height has to be decreased or granules velocity has to be increased. However, both these<br>
modifications reduce the residence time in the reactor and nullify the effect of the<br>
temperature increase.<br>
Alternatively, if the residence time in the reactor is increased either by increasing the bed<br>
height (assuming there is a sufficient reactor height) or by reducing the granules velocity,<br>
an increase of the polymer sticking tendency is caused.<br>
6<br><br>
To prevent the sticking phenomenon, the reactor temperature must be decreased and this,<br>
once again, nullifies the effect of the increased residence time on the product final IV.<br>
These constraints limit the ability of conventional plants, which use single or multiple<br>
vertical reactors, of increasing the polymer intrinsic viscosity IV.<br>
Less limited to this respect are the processes disclosed in publications WO 2004/018541<br>
(rotary inclined horizontal cylindrical reactor) and WO 2004/058852 (multistage fluidised<br>
bed for small size polyester granules) in the name of the same applicant; the point remains<br>
that even in these processes the reaction temperature must be comprised in the range<br>
between 200 and 230°C.<br>
A similar situation is met when an industrial scale plant with capacity above 450 metric<br>
tons per day has to be designed according to conventional continuous solid phase<br>
polymerisation processes.<br>
In fact, in a conventional process, there are two ways to reach high plant production<br>
capacity: again by increasing the reactor temperature or by increasing the product volume<br>
("hold-up") in the reactor.<br>
As far as drawbacks coming from the temperature increase are concerned, the same above<br>
described issues have to be considered.<br>
On the other hand, the product volume ("hold-up") of polyester granules in the reactor is<br>
constrained by bed height, reactor diameter and granule velocity. If the product volume<br>
("hold-up") is increased either by increasing bed height or reactor diameter, or by<br>
decreasing granules velocity, the polymer sticking tendency will increase too.<br>
As a consequence, these constraints limit the maximum capacity of conventional solid<br>
phase polymerisation processes, which use one or more vertical cylindrical reactors.<br>
7<br><br>
Nowadays, the growth in polyester and PET demand has given rise to a need for solid<br>
phase polymerisation processes by means of which it is possible to achieve a higher<br>
increase of polyester molecular weight and a higher production capacity, typically higher<br>
than 400 metric tons per day on single plant.<br>
The purpose of the present invention is therefore to overcome the limitations of continuous<br>
and/or discontinuous solid phase polymerisation processes of polyester known so far, by<br>
permitting to achieve better results in terms of increased intrinsic viscosity of the polyester<br>
itself.<br>
Another purpose of the invention is to achieve high production capacities in continuous<br>
and/or discontinuous solid phase polymerisation processes of polyester.<br>
As aforesaid, in solid phase polymerisation plants also the reaction temperature and the<br>
thermal level of all the process steps must be sufficient for the evolution of the process<br>
steps and for the reaction to occur: it is, therefore, a further purpose of the invention to<br>
decrease the reaction temperature and the thermal level of all the process steps,<br>
consequently decreasing the costs originating from the thermal energy use.<br>
A further purpose of the invention is to increase the production capacity of existing plants,<br>
built and operating according to conventional technologies, and/or to make the operating<br>
conditions less critical in terms of temperature, with limited capital investment cost<br>
associated to existing plant refurbishing.<br>
These and other purposes are achieved with the reactive atmosphere or gaseous<br>
composition and with the method of application of the same in processes for the<br>
continuous and/or discontinuous solid phase polymerisation of polyester according to the<br>
invention, as claimed in the attached claims.<br>
Advantageously, the use of a reactive atmosphere applicable to any process for the<br>
continuous and/or discontinuous solid phase polymerisation of polyester according to the<br>
invention allows to achieve higher molecular weight increases of the treated polyester<br>
when compared with the ones achievable with the conventional processes of the known<br>
8<br><br>
priorart, furthermore avoiding unwanted agglomeration phenomena and other side effects.<br>
Advantageously, moreover, the use of a reactive atmosphere applicable to any process for<br>
the continuous and/or discontinuous solid phase polymerisation of polyester according to<br>
the invention allows to achieve higher production capacities when compared with the<br>
plants exploiting the conventional processes.<br>
Advantageously, it is also possible to achieve a reduction of thermal energy consumption<br>
due to the decreased reaction temperature and to the low thermal level of all process steps<br>
with respect to conventional processes.<br>
It is furthermore possible to advantageously apply the reactive atmosphere according to<br>
the invention to any solid phase polymerisation process nowadays commercially available,<br>
in existing plants too, whose adaptation requires a limited capital investment cost.<br>
The invention will be now described in detail also with reference to the attached drawings,<br>
provided by way of not limiting example, in which:<br>
-	Fig. 1 shows a simplified scheme of application of the reactive atmosphere according to<br>
the invention to a conventional moving bed solid phase polymerisation process (for<br>
instance, Buehler, UOP-Sinco, Hosokawa-Bepex, Zimmer);<br>
-	Fig. 2A shows a schematic representation of the diffusion step of the reactive atmosphere<br>
inside the polyester granules;<br>
-	Fig. 2B shows a schematic representation of the reaction step of the reactive substance<br>
with the polyester macromolecules.<br>
The invention substantially consists of introducing a reactive substance, or a mixture of<br>
reactive substances, under gas and/or aerosol phase, into a purging inert gas stream<br>
recirculating through the different process steps and, in particular, coming into contact<br>
with the surface of the polyester granules in the solid phase polymerisation step; the gas<br>
9<br><br>
and/or aerosol phase within which the reactive substance, or the mixture of reactive<br>
substances, is diluted, therefore transforms the purging stream from inert (inert<br>
atmosphere) to reactive (reactive atmosphere or reactive gaseous composition).<br>
The considered reactive substances, taken singly and/or in mixture, belong by way of<br>
example to the categories of the di-epoxides, di-anhydrides, di-isocyanates,<br>
bis(oxoazolines), bis(di-hydro-oxoazines) and, in particular, they are molecules having<br>
reactive groups or reactive end-groups with respect to the constitutive groups of the<br>
macromolecules forming the polyesters; the reactive groups must be at least in the number<br>
of two because the aforesaid reactive substances act as chain extension units ("chain<br>
extenders") to achieve polymerisation degree increases and, therefore, higher, and/or<br>
faster, and/or at a lower temperature IV values.<br>
Any of the previously cited categories (di-epoxides, di-anhydrides, di-isocyanates, etc.)<br>
consists of a series of molecules having molecular weights gradually increasing and<br>
chemical-physical properties different one from another; within each category, the various<br>
molecules belonging thereof are joined by the fact that they have the same end groups,<br>
which are distinguished to be reactive with respect to the functional groups of the<br>
polyester macromolecules.<br>
As far as the introduction of the reactive substance, or of the mixture of reactive<br>
substances, under gas and/or aerosol phase, into the purging inert gas stream is concerned,<br>
it is necessary to specify that, preferably, the reactive substance, or the mixture of reactive<br>
substances, is diluted in a carrying fluid to form a fluid stream, which is liquid at the<br>
feeding standard operative conditions (room temperature, pressure = + 50 ÷ + 450 mbar<br>
g.) into the contactor in the process according to the present invention; said fluid stream is<br>
used to make reactive the purging inert gas stream, by contacting said two streams in a<br>
gas-liquid contactor. In particular, in the gas-liquid contactor, during the contact time<br>
between the two phases, through the contact area between the two phases, an amount of<br>
fluid stream, containing the reactive substance or the mixture of reactive substances,<br>
depending on the respective vapour pressures at the operative conditions of pressure and<br>
temperature (temperature = + 50 ÷ + 80 °C; pressure = + 50 ÷ + 450 mbar g.), passes into<br>
the purging gas stream, under gas and/or aerosol phase, according to the turbulence degree<br>
10<br><br>
developed from the gas-liquid contactor itself. This way, the purging inert gas stream fed<br>
into the gas-liquid contactor becomes reactive from inert as it was.<br>
The preferred mixing proportions, between the reactive substance, or the mixture of<br>
reactive substances, and the carrying fluid, provide that the reactive substance, or the<br>
mixture of reactive substances, is present in an amount 

substances, and the carrying fluid takes place according to known mixing techniques of<br>
two fluid phases, or by means of liquid-liquid contactors such as, for instance, liquid-<br>
liquid static mixers, stirred containers, pulsated columns and stirred plates columns. The<br>
mixture preparation is carried out under pressure and temperature conditions at which both<br>
the carrying fluid and the reactive substance, or the mixture of reactive substances, are in<br>
the liquid phase so to originate a liquid phase fluid stream to be introduced in the<br>
following gas-liquid contactor, within which such fluid stream preferably saturates the<br>
purging gas stream.<br>
The carrying fluid can consists of one or more substances in mixture belonging to the<br>
organic chemistry, preferably aromatic and non aromatic hydrocarbons, having a<br>
diffusivity into the PET of at least 1x10-12 m2/s, (if measured at 150 °C and at atmospheric<br>
pressure); by way of example, the carrying fluid can consists of orto-, meta- or para-<br>
xylene or mixed xylenes.<br>
It is, nevertheless, also possible that the reactive substance, or the mixture of reactive<br>
substances, is introduced as such into the purging gas stream, that is without previous<br>
dilution and therefore without the carrying aid of the carrying fluid.<br>
It is, furthermore, also possible that the reactive substance, or the mixture of reactive<br>
substances, as such or diluted into the carrying fluid, and/or the carrying fluid and/or a<br>
portion of purging gas and /or a further purging gas stream and/or a different purging gas<br>
stream are directly and separately introduced into the solid phase polymerisation reactor.<br>
11<br><br>
The method of application of the above-mentioned reactive substances introduced into the<br>
purging gas stream, which will be hereinafter disclosed with reference to Fig. 1, comprises<br>
the steps of:<br>
-	providing a reactive substance, or a mixture of reactive substances, R with respect to<br>
polyesters;<br>
-	preparing a fluid stream F preferably by diluting the reactive substance, or the mixture of<br>
reactive substances, R in a carrying fluid or "carrier" V;<br>
-	providing a purging inert gas stream G;<br>
-	feeding the fluid stream F from top into a gas-liquid contactor C1 and the purging inert<br>
gas stream G from bottom of said contactor, wherein the creation of contact area between<br>
the phases and the residence time allow to reach up to preferably saturate said stream G<br>
with said stream F, thus originating a reactive gas stream or reactive atmosphere or<br>
gaseous composition A;<br>
-	providing a solid phase polymerisation reactor R1 loaded with low molecular weight<br>
polyester granules P, crystallised and at high temperature, of at least a polyester;<br>
-	feeding the reactive gas stream A into the reactor R1 and make it flow in contact with the<br>
polyester granules P, thus allowing that diffusion phenomena of fluid F occur from outside<br>
each granule to inside thereof;<br>
-	letting that, once arrived inside the granule, preferably thanks to the carrying action of<br>
the carrying fluid V, the reactive substance R reacts with the polyester macromolecules<br>
through a mainly polyaddition mechanism.<br>
As far as the reactive substance, or the mixture of reactive substances, R is concerned, as<br>
already previously stated, it must have reactive groups or reactive end-groups with respect<br>
to the constitutive groups of the macromolecules forming the polyesters.<br>
12<br><br>
As far as the fluid stream F is concerned, it is preferably obtained by diluting the reactive<br>
substance, or the mixture of reactive substances, R in a carrying fluid or "carrier" V, said<br>
carrying fluid V having a high volatility and high diffusion coefficient in the polyester and<br>
preferably consisting of paraxylene or mixed xylenes; as already previously stated, the<br>
fluid stream F can also consists of the only reactive substance, or the mixture of reactive<br>
substances, R.<br>
This fluid stream F is in the liquid phase when fed into the gas-liquid contactor C1 and has<br>
a temperature lower than its boiling point, that is lower than the boiling point of the<br>
carrying fluid V and/or the reactive substance R, which form said fluid stream F.<br>
As far as the purging inert gas stream G is concerned, it must be beforehand purified and<br>
heated inside a suitable device El, for instance inside a heat exchanger, up to a<br>
temperature in the range 50 ÷ 80 °C and in any case lower than the boiling point of the<br>
fluid stream F, that is of at least 20 °C lower than the boiling point of the carrying fluid V<br>
and/or the reactive substance R, which form said fluid stream F.<br>
The fluid stream F and the purging inert gas stream G are fed in counter-current flow or in<br>
co-current flow into a gas-liquid contactor C1 of any type, for instance a bubble column, a<br>
plates column, a Venturi washing device ("Venturi scrubber"), a gas-liquid static mixer or<br>
a spray tower, wherein the creation of contact area between the phases and the residence<br>
time allow to reach up to preferably saturate said stream G with said stream F, thus<br>
originating a reactive gas stream or reactive atmosphere or gaseous composition A.<br>
Said gas-liquid contactor C1 must operate at a temperature lower than the boiling point of<br>
the fluid stream F, that is at a temperature lower than both the boiling point of the carrying<br>
fluid V and the boiling point of the substance or mixture of reactive substances R, which<br>
form the fluid stream F itself.<br>
Due to the multiplicity of reactive substances R and carrying fluids V that can be used<br>
according to the present invention, the residence time in the gas-liquid contactor C1 will<br>
be defined, during the design stage of the contactor itself, as ΤC1≥ ΤS50%, where ΤS50% is the<br>
13<br><br>
contact time between the phases necessary to reach the 50% of saturation of the fluid<br>
stream F in the purging gas stream G at the operative conditions of pressure and<br>
temperature (temperature = + 50 ÷ + 80 °C; pressure = + 50 ÷ + 450 mbar g.) in the<br>
contactor used in the process according to the present invention; the actual content of fluid<br>
stream F must be equal at least to 0.025% by weight, preferably equal at least to 0.05% by<br>
weight, of the reactive gas stream A to be fed into the solid phase polymerisation reactor.<br>
The solid phase polymerisation reactor R1 is loaded with low molecular weight polyester<br>
granules P (IV = 0.15 0.75 dl/g), crystallised and at high temperature (temperature =100<br>
150 °C) of at least a polyester.<br>
The operative temperature of solid phase polymerisation reactors to which the reactive<br>
atmosphere is applied is lower of at least 50°C, and preferably lower of at least 70°C, than<br>
the process temperature, applied in the same plant and with the same polymer, without the<br>
reactive atmosphere. By way of example, if in a conventional existing plant, for instance<br>
in a moving bed vertical solid phase polymerisation reactor, a PET is processed, without<br>
using the reactive atmosphere, the temperature of the solid phase polymerisation reactor<br>
being of 210°C, while by applying the reactive atmosphere according to the present<br>
invention, said temperature of the solid phase polymerisation reactor is decreased at least<br>
to 160°C, and preferably at least to 140°C.<br>
The reactive gas stream A is fed into the reactor R1 and is made to flow into contact with<br>
the polyester granules P, thus allowing that diffusion phenomena of fluid F occur from<br>
outside each granule to inside thereof.<br>
The feeding temperature of the reactive atmosphere A into the solid phase polymerisation<br>
reactor may be any of the temperatures comprised in the range between the operative<br>
temperature of the gas-liquid contactor C1 and the operative temperature of the solid phase<br>
polymerisation reactor; practically, it is convenient that the feeding temperature of the<br>
reactive atmosphere A into the solid phase polymerisation reactor is equal to the operative<br>
temperature, or little lower due to possible thermal wastes, of the gas-liquid contactor C1,<br>
so to avoid using an heater between the exit of the gas-liquid contactor and the feeding<br>
into the solid phase reactor. As far as the feeding pressure is concerned, it depends on the<br>
14<br><br>
head losses that the reactive gas stream should overcome when passing through the solid<br>
phase polymerisation reactor; by way of example, in case the reactor is of the moving bed<br>
vertical type (wherein the overall head loss is due to gas flow through PET chips granules<br>
bed and through piping that the stream meets once it exits the reactor), the pressure will<br>
vary between + 150 mbar g. (for 100 tpd plants) and + 300 mbar g. (for 500 tpd plants),<br>
while in case the reactor is of the rotary inC1ined horizontal cylindrical reactor type<br>
(wherein the gas has not to pass through the PET granules bed), the pressure will vary<br>
between + 30 mbar g. and + 70 mbar g.<br>
Once arrived inside the granule, preferably thanks to the carrying action of the carrying<br>
fluid V, the reactive substance A reacts with the polyester macromolecules through a<br>
mainly polyaddition mechanism, which has chemical reaction kinetics much more faster<br>
than those of the polycondensation mechanism, that lead to the increase of the average<br>
molecular weight and that occur among the single polyester molecules in inert atmosphere<br>
solid phase polymerisation processes; illustrative polyaddition reactions between the<br>
reactive substances and the reactive end terminals of polyester are shown in Scheirs, J. -<br>
Long, T. E., "Modern Polyester", John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd., 2004, Chapter 14, Paragraphs<br>
2.1 (Di-anhydrides), 2.2 (Bis(oxoazolines)) e 2.3 (Di-epoxides).<br>
Exactly to the purpose of facilitating the penetration of the reactive substance molecule<br>
inside the granules and, therefore, of avoiding that the reaction between said reactive<br>
substance and the polyester granules occurs only on the superficial layers of the granules<br>
contacted by the reactive gas stream, according to the present invention the reactive<br>
substance molecule is preferably not introduced as such into the gas stream that will<br>
contact the polyester granules, but it is diluted into a carrying fluid fitted to allow the<br>
aforesaid penetration.<br>
A schematic representation of, respectively, the diffusion and reaction phases described<br>
above is given in Fig. 2A and 2B.<br>
The carrying fluid, which does not take part in the reaction and which does not stay bound<br>
to the polymeric matrix, thanks to its high volatility is evacuated off the granules during<br>
the following process steps and it is removed by oxidation and/or by adsorption and/or by<br>
15<br><br>
cryocondensation and/or by washing ("scrubbing") in the gas purification unit present in<br>
any solid phase polymerisation plant.<br>
From the applicative standpoint, the substantial process modification provided for<br>
according to the present invention may be implemented in all the plants designed, built<br>
and operated in accordance with any of the solid phase polymerisation processes<br>
nowadays commercially available; in particular, implementation of the present invention<br>
can easily take place both in new plants (that is to be designed and built from the<br>
beginning) and in existing plants (that is already built and operated in accordance with<br>
conventional technologies), through simple plant modifications.<br>
From the realisation standpoint, always referring to Fig. 1, implementation of the present<br>
invention in an existing plant takes place through simple plant modifications, which<br>
substantially provide for introducing a gas-liquid contactor C1, for instance a bubble<br>
column, located downstream the heating device E1 for the purified inert gas stream to be<br>
sent to the solid phase polymerisation reactor R1; the mass transfer area between the<br>
phases and the contact time inside the contactor are suitably designed according to the unit<br>
operations rules so as to bring the fluid stream F content, preferably consisting of carrying<br>
fluid V and reactive substance R, in the purging inert gas stream G preferably up to the<br>
saturation point, before leaving the contactor itsE1f. The reactive gas stream A is then fed<br>
into the solid phase polymerisation reactor R1, so as to allow that the solid phase<br>
polymerisation reaction in reactive atmosphere occurs, with all the resulting advantages.<br>
The numerical simulations performed have shown that the use of a reactive gas stream,<br>
that is of the purging gas saturated of the mixture consisting of the carrying fluid and the<br>
reactive substance bE1onging to the previously cited categories, allows to decrease the<br>
reaction temperature from the range 200-230°C of the current conventional processes to a<br>
range 100-150°C, with consequential energy saving, reduced crystallisation requirements<br>
and reduced potential sticking problems.<br>
16<br><br>
Moreover, always according to the above-mentioned numerical simulations, the reaction<br>
time (at a reaction temperature in the range 100-150°C) proves to be equal to about 1/3 of<br>
the reaction time required in the conventional processes, notwithstanding that the latters<br>
operate at a reaction temperature comprised in the range 200-230 °C.<br>
With reference to the plant implementation of Fig. 1, one embodiment is hereinafter<br>
disC1osed.<br>

carried  out  on  a  laboratory-scale,  cylindrical,  vertical,  discontinuous  solid  phase<br>
polymerisation reactor, with capacity equal to 40 kg of PET granules. Said reactor is<br>
stirred by a slow anchor stirrer (2-4 rpm) and is operated under gas stream.<br>

18<br><br>
-	inert gas stream: 100% nitrogen with cryogenic purity,<br>
-	inert gas stream temperature = 205 °C.<br>
A second set of tests has been carried out by simulating the process conditions of a process<br>
occurring in reactive atmosphere, according to the present invention:<br>
-	temperature of the reactor thermostatised in diathermic oil bath = 130 °C,<br>

The invention will be further advantageously applicable to any polyester that can be solid<br>
phase polymerised. The most common polyesters suitable for use in the present invention<br>
have at least about 75 mole percent of their acid moieties consisting of an aromatic<br>
dicarboxylic acid, such as terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid, or a naphthalenic<br>
dicarboxylic acid (preferably 2,6-) with the diol moieties consisting of glycols such as<br>
ethylene glycol, butylene glycol, 1,4-dimethylol cyclohexane and the like or aromatic<br>
diols such as hydroquinone and catechol. Said polyesters can contain other dicarboxylic<br>
acids such as adipic acid, isophthalic acid, sebacic acid, and the like. Polyethylene<br>
terephthalate, polyethylene isophthalate, polyethylene naphthalate, and polybutylene<br>
terephthalate homopolymers are representative examples of such polyesters.<br>
Blends of various polyesters can also be solid phase polymerised in the process according<br>
to the invention. The polyester pre-polymers (amorphous starting polyesters) utilised in<br>
this invention can be made in any manner but are typically prepared by conventional mE1t<br>
phase polymerisation techniques. These polyester pre-polymers have an initial starting IV<br>
of at least about 0.2 d1/g as measured in a 60:40 (by weight): phenol ÷ 1,1,2,2,-<br>
tetrachloroethane solvent system at a temperature of 30 °C. The rate at which polyethylene<br>
terephthalate pre-polymer can be solid state polymerised also depends on the carboxyl end<br>
group (i.e.-COOH) content of the pre-polymer. Generally, pre-polymers having a carboxyl<br>
end group content within the range of about 18% to about 40% achieve maximum solid<br>
state polymerisation rates. It is preferred for such pre-polymers to have a carboxyl end<br>
group content within the range of about 24% to 33% (see for example US 4,238,593).<br>
Suitable polyester pre-polymers which can be solid state polymerised using my invention<br>
are comprised of one or more diacid components and one or more diol components. The<br>
diacid component in the polyesters are normally alkyl dicarboxylic acids which contain<br>

carbon atoms, aryl dicarboxylic acids which contain from 8 to 20 carbon atoms, diesters of<br>
aryl dicarboxylic acids which contain from 10 to 2.2 carbon atoms, alkyl substituted aryl<br>
20<br><br>

substituted aryl dicarboxylic acids which contain from 11 to 22 carbon atoms. The<br>
preferred alkyl dicarboxylic acids will contain from 4 to 12 carbon atoms. Some<br>
representative examples of such alkyl dicarboxylic acids inC1ude glutaric acid, adipic acid,<br>
pimE1ic acid, and the like. The preferred diesters of alkyl dicarboxylic acids will contain<br>
from 6 to 12 carbon atoms. A representative example of such a diester of an alkyl<br>
dicarboxylic acid is azelaic acid. The preferred aryl dicarboxylic acids contain from 8 to<br>
16 carbon atoms. Some representative examples of aryl dicarboxylic acids are terephthalic<br>
acid, isophthalic acid, and orthophthalic acid. The preferred diesters of aryl dicarboxylic<br>
acids contain from 10 to 18 carbon atoms. Some representative examples of diesters of<br>
aryl dicarboxylic acids include diethyl terephthalate, diethyl isophthalate, diethyl<br>
orthophthalate, dimethyl naphthalate, diethyl naphthalate and the like. The preferred alkyl<br>
substituted aryl dicarboxylic acids contain from 9 to 16 carbon atoms and the preferred<br>
diesters of alkyl substituted aryl dicarboxylic acids contain from 11 to 15 carbon atoms.<br>
The diol component of the polyester pre-polymers is normally comprised of glycols<br>
containing from 2 to 12 carbon atoms, glycol ethers containing from 4 to 12 carbon atoms,<br>
and polyether glycols having the structural formula HO-(A-O)n-H wherein A is an<br>
alkylene group containing from 2 to 6 carbon atoms and wherein n is an integer from 2 to<br>
400. Generally, such polyether glycols will have a molecular weight of 400 to about 4000.<br>
Preferred glycols normally contain from 2 to 8 carbon atoms and more preferably from 4<br>
to 8 carbon atoms. Some representative examples of glycols that can be utilised as the diol<br>
component inC1ude ethylene glycol, 1,3-propylene glycol, 1,2-propylene glycol, 2,2-<br>
diethyl-1,3-propane diol, 2,2-dimethyl-1,3 -propane diol, 2-butyl-1,3-propane diol, 2-ethyl-<br>
2-isobutyl-l,3-propane diol, 1,3-butane diol, 1,4-butane diol, 1,5-pentane diol, 1,6-hexane<br>
diol, 2,2,4-trimethyl-1,6-hexane diol, 1,3-cyclohexane dimethanol, 1,4-cyclohexane<br>
dimethanol, and 2,2,4,4-tetramethyl-l,3-cyclobutane diol. Some representative examples<br>
of polyether glycols that can be used include polytetramethylene glycol and polyethylene<br>
glycol.<br>
Branched polyester pre-polymers can also be solid state polymerised in the process of the<br>
present invention. Such branched polyesters normally contain branching agents which<br>
have three or more functional groups and preferably three or four functional groups.<br>
21<br><br>
Reactive functional groups can be carboxyl groups or aliphatic hydroxyl groups. The<br>
branching agent utilised in such branched polyesters can optionally contain both carboxyl<br>
groups and hydroxyl groups. Examples of acidic branching agents inC1ude trimesic acid,<br>

acids, and cyC1ohexane-l,3,5-tricarboxylic acids. Some representative examples of<br>
hydroxyl branching agents (polyols) inC1ude glycerin, trimethylol propane, pentaerythritol,<br>
dipentaerythritol, 1,2,6-hexane triol, and 1,3,5-trimethylol benzene. Generally, from 0 to 3<br>
percent of a polyol containing from 3 to 12 carbon atoms will be used as the branching<br>
agent (based upon the total diol component).<br>
High strength polyesters which utilise at least one bis-hydroxyalkyl pyromE1litic diimide<br>
in their diol component can also be solid state polymerised. The diol component in these<br>
polyesters will normally contain from 5 to 50 mole percent of one or more bis-<br>
hydroxyalkyl pyromE1litic diimides and will preferably be comprised of from 10 to 25<br>
mole percent of at least one bis-hydroxyalkyl pyromE1litic diimide. The remaining portion<br>
of the diol component is comprised of additional copolymerisable diols.<br>
