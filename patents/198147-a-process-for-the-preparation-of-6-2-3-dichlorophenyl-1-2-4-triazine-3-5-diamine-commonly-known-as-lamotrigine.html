TITLE<br>
A process for the preparation of 6-(2,3-dichlorophenyl)-1,2,4-triazine-3,5-diamine, commonly known as lamotrigine<br>
APPLICANTS<br>
RPG Life Sciences Limited, Ceat Mahal, 463 Dr Annie Besant Road, Worli, Mumbai - 400025, Maharashtra, India, an Indian company<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the natuTe of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :<br><br>
1 9 FEB 2004<br><br>
This invention relates to a process for the preparation of 6-(2,3-dichlorophenyl)-l,2,4-triazine-3,5-diamine, commonly known as lamotrigine.<br>
Technical Field<br>
This invention relates to a process for the preparation of 6-(2,3-<br>
dichlorophenyl)-l,2,4-triazine-3,5-diamine of the formula I:<br><br>
Formula I commonly known as Lamotrigine.<br>
Lamotrigine, an anti-epileptic drug elicits its action by suppressing seizures by inhibiting the release of excitatory, neurotransmitters. Lamotrigine presently offers a worthwhile alternative for treating patients suffering from nitractable partial seizures coupled with or without secondary generalised seizuers and, therefore, shows good potential for broader applications in other areas of epilepsy management.<br><br>
Background Art<br>
One method of preparation of lamotngine of the formula I involves reaction of 6-(2,3-dichlorophenyl&gt;5-chloro-3-thiomethyl-1,2,4-triazine of the formula II:    CI<br><br>
Formula II with ethanolic ammonia in a sealed tube at 180°C/250 psi pressure (PCT<br>
Publication No WO 96/20935).   This process is time consuming (~72<br>
hours) and also produces lamotngine in low yields because of which it is<br>
not commercially viable.<br>
Another route for the synthesis of lamotngine of the formula I involves photochemical reaction of the compound of the formula III:<br>
CL	JC <br>
R<br>
Formula III where R = CNor CONH* using ultraviolet or visible radiation in the presence of a base in an alkanol solvent and also heating when R = CN (PCT Publication No WO 96/20934). The preparation of the compound<br><br>
of the formula III involves expensive and hn';irdous reagents. Further, undesired by-products like the de-aminated hydroxy derivative of triazine formed during the photochemical reaction demand elaborate separation and purification techniques, thereby making this route lengthy and tedious, besides producing low yields of lamotrigine (: 10 %). Therefore this process is not suitable for industrial scale manufacture of lamotrigine.<br>
Yet another method for the synthe-Hs of lamotrigine of  the formula I involves cyclisation of the Scliiffs base of the formula IV:<br><br>
Formula IV by refluxing in CrC4 aliphatic alkanol in the   presence or absence of a strong   base such as KOH (EP Patent No   21121 and   US Patents Nos 4602017 and 4847249).<br>
The  Schiff s base of the formula IV  may be prepared by a sequence of steps comprising :<br><br>
Formula V<br>
(1)     reaction of 2,3-dichloroiodobenzene of the formula V :<br><br>
with magnesium, followed by reaction of the resulting Grignard moiety with solid carbondioxide;<br>
(2)	reaction of the resulting 2,3-dichlorobenzoic acid<br>
of the formula VI:	CcooH Formula VI<br>
with thionyl chloride in an inert atmosphere such as moisture free<br>
nitrogen gas;<br>
(3)	reaction of the resulting 2,3-dichlorobenzoyl<br>
chloride of the formula VH:<br>
C-l<br>
c1<br>
coc1 Formula VII<br>
with a metal cyanide and alkali metal iodide such as Cu(one)CN and<br>
KI in the presence of an organic solvent such as xylene in an inert<br>
atmosphere such as nitrogen; and<br>
(4)	reaction of the resulting 2,3-dichlorobenzoyl-<br>
cyanide of the formula Vm:<br><br><br>
Formula VIII	„<br>
with aminoguanidine bicarbonate in an organic solvent such as DMSO in<br>
aqueous acidic medium using 8N HNO3.    The purification of crude<br>
lamotrigine of the formula I thus obtained by cyclisation of the SchifFs<br>
base of the formula IV is carried out by recrystallisation from isopropanol<br>
(EP Patents Nos 59987 and 21121 and US Patents Nos 4602017 and<br>
3637688).<br>
The formation of 2,3-dichlorobenzoic acid of the formula VT for the preparation of the SchifFs base of the formula IV by the above route demands a dry environment thereby making the process laborious. These reactions leading to the Setoff's base of the formula IV also employ expensive and hazardous reagents like DMSO in large quantities and xylene. The conversion of 2,3-dichlorobenzoyl chloride to 2,3-dichlorobenzoyl cyanide takes 96 hours thereby making the entire process for the synthesis of the SchifFs base from 2,3-dichlorobenzoyl chloride time consuming (-7.5 - 10 days). This route also produces low yields of lamotrigine (~10%). Therefore this process for the preparation of lamotridine is not feasible for industrial scale manufacture.<br><br>
The Setoff's base of the formula IV may also be prepared by the reaction of 2,3-dichlorobenzoyl cyanide of the formula VIII with aminoguanidine bicarbonate in the presence of acetonitrile and dilute aqueous sulfuric acid (US Patent No 4847249). This route for the synthesis of the Setoffs base is reported to produce low yields of lamotrigine.<br>
As lamotrigine has emerged to be one of the promising anti-epileptic and anti-convulsant agents for treating CNS disorders, its commercial production assumes significance. Despite the several routes known for the synthesis of lamotrigine there is still need for a route which is safe, convenient, efficient, economical and less time consuming.<br>

According to the invention a new route is employed in the preparation of lamotrigine of the formula 1. The substrate for the preparation thereof viz 2,3-aHchloronitrobenzene and also the other reagents of the process of the invention are safe, inexpensive and easily available, thus eliminating the use of hazardous and expensive reagents reported in the prior art The reactions leading to 2,3-dichlorobenzoic acid need not be carried out in a dry environment Also chlorination of 2,3-dichloro-benzoic acid is conveniently carried out in a non-inert atmosphere without affecting the efficiency of the process. The use of catalyst during reduction of 2,3-dicMoronfaobenzene at room temperature proceeds without dehalogenation thereby giving increased yield and purity of 2,3-dichloroamline. Also the other intermediates of the process of the invention are obtained in good yields and purity. The conversion of 2,3-dichlorobenzoyl chloride to 2,3-dichlorobenzoyl cyanide requires about 6 hours, as against 96 hours reported in a process of the prior art. Similarly the preparation of the Setoff's base from 2,3-dichlorobenzoyl  chloride  and<br><br>
further insitu cyclisation of the Schiffs base to lamotrigine also is less time consuming (8 hrs), as against 7.5-10 days reported in the prior art processes to prepare the Schiffs base itself. Therefore, the process of the invention is less time consuming and economical. The process of the invention gives a yield of 23% of lamotrigine (starting from 2,3-dichloronitrobenzene) as against a meagre yield of 10% (from 2,3-dichloroiodobenzene) reported in the prior art. Lamotrigine by our invention is also obtained with an excellent purity of 99.67% (by HPLC) after recrystallisation. The process of the invention is, therefore, efficient and economical and also suitable for industrial scale manufacture.<br>
