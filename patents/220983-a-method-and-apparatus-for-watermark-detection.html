				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a method and apparatus for detecting a watermark embedded in a suspect image.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Watermarking is a technique to certify the ownership of images or video. Usually, the watermark is embedded by adding a specific low-amplitude noisy pattern to the image. The noisy pattern represents the watermark. Whether or not a suspect image has an embedded given watermark is detected at the receiver end by computing the correlation of the suspect image with an applied version of said watermark, and comparing the correlation with a threshold. If the correlation is larger than the threshold, the applied watermark is said to be present, otherwise it is said to be absent<br>
Applicant"s previously filed International Patent Application IB99/00358 (PHN 17.316) discloses an arrangement for detecting a watermark that is embedded by repeating a small-sized basic watermark pattern over the extent of the image. Such a "tiling" operation allows the watermark detection process to search the watermark over a relatively small space and improves the reliability of detection.<br>
It is known that most watermarking techniques are not resistant to geometric distortions of the image. Manipulations such as translation, scaling, rotation, or stretching destroy the correlation between the manipulated image and the applied watermark. The above-mentioned prior-art watermark detector is resistant to translation but lacks the ability of detecting the watermark if the image has been scaled, rotated or stretched.<br>
OBJECT AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide an improved watermark detection method and apparatus.<br>
To this end, the method of detecting a watermark in a suspect image comprises the steps of detecting whether said suspect image includes a periodically repeated embedded data partem, and concluding that said periodically repeated data pattern represents an<br><br>
embedded watermark. The invention is based on the recognition that operations such as scaling, rotating and stretching change but do not destroy the periodicity of a watermark if said watermark is embedded by means of the above-mentioned "tiling" operation. Accordingly, the mere presence of a periodically repeated data pattern in the suspect image signifies that the image has been watermarked.<br>
Detection as to whether the embedded watermark is a specific given watermark is achieved by processing the suspect image or the given watermark is such a way that the original correlation is restored. This is achieved in an embodiment of the method which comprises the steps of determining the periodicity of said data pattern, applying a given watermark having a given periodicity, processing the suspect image and/or the given watermark so as to match the periodicity of the data pattern in the processed suspect image with the periodicity of the processed given watermark, and detecting whether the data pattern in the processed suspect image corresponds to the processed given watermark. The aim of the step of processing the suspect image is to undo the manipulation (scaling, rotation, stretching) which the suspect image has undergone after it is watermarked.<br>
Unites States Patent US-A-5,636,292 discloses the step of adding a separate calibration signal (e.g. a sine wave witii a specified frequency) to die image. When the image is scaled or rotated, the frequency of the sine wave changes, which results in a peak displacement in the image"s frequency spectrum. The invention differs from mis prior art in that the periodic watermark pattern itself provides the calibration parameters.<br>
These and other aspects of the invention are apparent from and will be elucidated with reference to die embodiments described hereinafter.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS<br>
In order to provide background information, a prior-art watermark embedder and a prior-art watermark detector are described first. Fig. 1 shows a practical embodiment of a prior-art watermark embedder. The embedder comprises an image source 11, which generates an image P, and an adder 12 which adds a given watermark W to the image P. The watermark W is a noise pattern having the same size as the image, e.g. Nj pixels horizontally and N2 pixels vertically (for example, 720x576 for PAL-TV). It is generated by repeating, and if necessary truncating, smaller basic watermark patterns or "tiles" W over the extent of the image. This tiling operation, which is carried out by a tiling circuit 13, is illustrated in Fig. 2. The basic patterns W have a fixed size M1XM2, for example, 128x128 pixels.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a practical embodiment of a prior-art watermark detector. The detector receives possibly watermarked images Q. The image (or a number of accumulated video frames) is partitioned into blocks having the size M1XM2 of the basic watermark pattern W to be detected (here, 128x128). The blocks are then stacked in a buffer q of size MJXMJ as illustrated in Fig. 4. These operations are carried out by a folding and buffer circuit 31.<br>
To detect whether or not the buffer q includes the given watermark pattern W, the buffer contents and said watermark pattern W are subjected to correlation. Computing the correlation of a suspect information signal q with a watermark pattern w comprises computing the inner product d=<q> of the information signal values and the corresponding values of the watermark pattern. For the two-dimensional M1XM2 image block q={qjj} and watermark pattern W={wy}, the inner product can be written in mathematical notation as:<br><br>
As the suspect image Q may have undergone manipulations such as translation or cropping prior to the watermark detection, the detector does not know the spatial location of the watermark pattern W with respect to the boundaries of image block q. A multiple of correlations a* must therefore be calculated for all possible shift vectors k (kx pixels horizontally and ky pixels vertically);<br>
Said correlation values d* can be simultaneously computed using the (Fast) Fourier Transform. Both the contents of buffer q and the basic watermark partem W are subjected to a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in transform circuits 32 and 33, respectively. These operations yield:<br>
q = FFT(q)and<br>
w = FFT(w), where q and w are sets of complex numbers.<br>
Computing the correlation is similar to computing the convolution of q and the conjugate of W. In the transform domain, this corresponds to:<br>
d = q®conj(w) where the symbol ® denotes pointwise multiplication and conjQ denotes inverting the sign of the imaginary part of the argument. In Fig. 3, the conjugation of w is carried out by a conjugation circuit 34, and the pointwise multiplication is carried out by a multiplier 35. The set of correlation values d={dic} is now obtained by inverse Fourier transforming the result of said multiplication:<br>
d * IFFT(d) which is carried out by an inverse FFT circuit 36. The correlation values d* are subsequently compared with a given threshold in a threshold circuit 37. The watermark pattern W is detected to be present if one of the correlation values has a significant peak, i.e. larger than the threshold.<br>
The prior-art detection method lacks performance if the suspect image has been subjected to manipulations that affect the size and/or geometric form of the embedded watermark pattern. Examples of such manipulations are scaling, rotation and stretching (or shearing). Such manipulations, which have the property that straight lines remain straight,. parallel lines remain parallel, while for non-parallel lines the angle may change, are often referred to as affine transforms. Figs. 5A-5C show the effects of scaling, rotation and shearing, respectively, on the watermarked image shown in Fig. 2. similar as in Fig. 2, the basic<br><br>
watermark patterns are symbolically shown as a clearly visible W. However, each W is a low-amplitude, imperceptible, noisy partem in practice. It will be appreciated that the correlation between the suspect images shown in Figs. 5A-5C and the originally embedded watermark (see Fig. 2) has largely been destroyed.<br>
Fig. 6 shows schematically a watermark detector in accordance with the invention. The detector calculates the autocorrelation of the suspect image and determines whether said correlations exhibit a periodic pattern. The embodiment of the watermark detector shown in Fig. 6 calculates the autocorrelation of the suspect image. More in particular, the detector calculates the correlations<br>
between suspect image Q and a shifted version of the same image for all possible shift vectors k (kx pixels horizontally and ky pixels vertically). As already described above with reference to Fig. 3, the required calculations can be advantageously carried out by using the (Fast) Fourier Transform. Accordingly, the detector comprises an FFT circuit 61, a conjugation circuit 62, a multiplier 63 for pointwise multiplying the transformed image and the conjugated version thereof, and an inverse FFT circuit 64.<br>
The output of the inverse FFT circuit 64 is an N1XN2 matrix of correlation values dk. The center (0,0) of this matrix represents the correlation for kx=0, ky=0. Said value is extremely large because it represents the correlation between the suspect image and itself. The correlation quickly declines as the shift is larger. However, if the image includes a repeated watermark pattern, the matrix has local peaks at the coordinates for which the watermark patterns in the image and its shifted version coincide. Figs. 7A-7C show such peak patterns for the manipulated images that are shown in Figs. 5A-5C, respectively. For completeness, it is be noted that the matrix may also include peaks for shifts |kx|&gt;Ni/2 and |kyj&gt;N2/2 due to aliasing. These peaks generally have a low value and are not shown in Figs. 7A-7C.<br>
A peak detection and analysis circuit 65 detects the peaks and analyzes whether the peak pattern exhibits a repetitive pattern. To this end, the circuit determines whether at least a subset of the peaks constitutes a regular pattern. Such analysis algorithms are known in the art. For example, there are mathematical algorithms that search basic vectors with which the periodical peak pattern can be reconstructed through linear combination. Examples of basic vectors thus found are denoted ki and k2 in Figs. 7A-7C. If a repetitive peak pattern is found by the mathematical analysis, the circuit 65 outputs a detection signal D to indicate that<br><br>
the suspect image is most likely an image that has been watermarked fay means of a tiling operation as explained above. The circuit 65 also outputs the basic vectors ki and kj for use by hither processing circuits as will be described below.<br>
Another embodiment of the watermark detector is shown in Fig. 8. This detector calculates the correlation between different image regions rather than the autocorrelation. The detector comprises an image splitting circuit 81 which divides the image into two regions, for example a left half QL and a right half QR. A correlation circuit comprising a first FFT circuit 82, a second FFT circuit 83, a conjugation circuit 84, a multiplier 85 and an IFFT circuit 86 calculates the correlation between the two half images in a manner as described above. It generates a peak pattern which has now half the image size. The peak pattern is applied to a peak detection and analysis circuit 87 which operates in a similar manner as peak detection and analysis circuit 65 in Fig. 6. The need for two FFT circuits (82,83) in Fig. 8 compared with the single FFT circuit (61) in Fig. 6 is largely compensated by reduction of the computational complexity. It will be appreciated that the computational complexity can be further reduced by dividing the image into even more regions.<br>
The watermark detectors shown in Figs. 6 and 8 do not provide information as to whether the embedded watermark is a specific given watermark. A watermark detector which does detect the presence of a given watermark in a possibly manipulated suspect image is shown in Fig. 9. The watermark detector comprises a conventional watermark detection device 3 as described before with reference to Fig. 3. In accordance with the invention, the suspect image Q is now processed by an image processing device 9 before being applied to the conventional detector 3. The task of image processor 9 is to undo the manipulations that the image Q has undergone after the watermark was embedded. To this end, the image processor 9 receives parameters representative of said manipulations from an analysis device 6. The analysis device is a device as described above with reference to Fig. 6 or Fig. 8. The basic vectors ki and k.2 found by the device (see Figs. 7A-7C) are examples of parameters that are indicative of the periodicity of the basic watermark pattern in image Q. The image processor 9 is arranged to manipulate (scale, rotate, shear or combinations thereof) the image Q in response to said parameters so that the processed image Q" exhibits a given periodicity. More particularly, the suspect image is processed so that the two basic vectors in the processed image are orthogonal with respective lengths Mi and M2 (here 128). Algorithms with which mis can be achieved are generally known in the field of image processing;.<br><br>
The same result is achieved when the watermark to be detected is subjected to the same manipulations as the suspect image, and the presence of said manipulated watermark pattern in the suspect image is subsequently detected. An embodiment of such a watermark detector is shown in Fig. 10. The manipulation parameters ki and k2 found by analysis device 6 are now applied to a processing circuit 10 which carries out the same manipulations to the basic watermark pattern W. The 128x 128 watermark pattern W is thus transformed into a version W" which corresponds to the pattern in the suspect image. This is illustrated in Fig. 11 which shows a scaled watermark pattern 11a, a rotated watermark pattern lib and a sheared watermark pattern lie corresponding to the image manipulations that are shown in Figs. 5A-5C, respectively.<br>
A potential problem of the watermark detector shown in Figs. 9 and 10 is that the processing operation to be carried out by the image processor 9 or 10 is not unambiguously defined by the basic vectors ki and k2. As an example thereof, Fig. 12A shows the effect of rotating an image through 90° and subsequently shearing the result. The peak partem found by the analysis device 6, and thus the periodicity, is exacdy the same as the periodicity of an image which has been sheared only (cf. Fig. 5C). If the image processor merely undoes the shearing operation, the watermark will not be detected. Fortunately, the number of (combinations of) manipulations that lead to the same peak pattern is limited, and many of them are not used in practice. In view thereof, the processing circuit (9 in Fig. 9,10 in Fig. 10) in a preferred embodiment of the watermark detector executes a plurality of appropriate candidate inverse manipulations, and the watermark detector 3 detects the presence of the watermark on the basis of the one which gives the highest correlation. Such an embodiment can easily be designed by a skilled person in view of the foregoing description and will therefore not be described in more detail.<br>
The invention is summarized as follows. Most watermarking schemes are not resistant to geometric distortions of a watermarked image, because such manipulations destroy the correlation between the original watermark and the watermark in the manipulated image. A method and arrangement are disclosed that restore the correlation. To this end, a suspect image (Q) is analyzed (6) for the presence of a repeated data pattern. If such a pattern is found, it is concluded that the image has been watermarked by "tiling" a small-sized watermark pattern over the extent of the image. The actual detection of whether the watermark is a given watermark W is subsequently performed by deterrnining the periodicity of the pattern found in the suspect image, and processing (9) the suspect image so as to match the periodicity of the processed image with the given periodicity of the watermark to be detected. If the suspect<br><br>
image indeed includes the given watermark W, the geometric manipulation is thereby undone and a conventional watermark detector (3) will signify this accordingly. If a combination of operations can generate the same periodicity, the detection step will include the set of possible combinations.<br><br><br>
