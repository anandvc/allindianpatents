FIELD OP THE ISVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to tellurium-promoted, noble metal-containing catalysts and their use in liquid phase oxidation reactions. More particularly, the invention relates to enhancing the activity, selectivity and/or stability of a carbon-supported, noble metal-containing catalyst by incorporating tellurium as a promoter metal at a surface of the carbon support.  In certain preferred embodiments, the tellurium-promoted catalysts of the present invention are used in the liquid phase oxidation of N-(phosphonomethyl) iminodiacetic acid substrates, formaldehyde and/or formic acid.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE  INVENTION<br>
N-(phosphonomethyl) glycine (also known in the agricultural chemical industry as glyphosate) and its salts are conveniently applied as a component of acfueous, post-emergent herbicide formulations. As such, they are particularly useful as a highly effective and commercially important broad-spectrum herbicide for killing or controlling the growth of a wide variety of plants, including germinating seeds, emerging seedlings, maturing and established woody and herbaceous vegetation and aquatic plants.<br>
One of the more widely accepted methods of making N-<br>
(phosphonomethyl)glycine comprises the liquid phase oxidative cleavage of a carboxymethyl substituent from an F-<br>
(phosphonomethyl) iminodiacetic acid substrate using an oxygen-containing gas in the presence of a heterogeneous oxidation catalyst. As used herein, "N-<br>
(phosphonomethyl) iminodiacetic acid substrates" include K-<br><br>
(phosphonomethyl)iminodiacetic acid and salts thereof, wherein the salt-forming cation is, for exatnple, atnmoniutn, alkylainmoniura, an alkali metal or an alkaline earth metal. N-(phosphonomethyl) glycine may be prepared by the liquid phase oxidative cleavage of N-(phosphonomethyl) iminodiacetic acid with oxygen in accordance with the following reaction:<br><br>
Other by-products also may form, such as formic acid, which is fonned by oxidation of the fortnaldehyde by-product and aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) , which is formed by oxidation of N-(phosphonomethyl) glycine. The preference for heterogenous catalysis stems, at least in part, from the relative ease with which a particulate heterogeneous catalyst can normally be separated from the reaction product mixture for reuse following the oxidation.  The literature is replete with examples of heterogeneous catalysts.  See generally, Franz, et al., Glvphosate; A Unique Global Herbicide (ACS Monograph 189, 1997) at pp. 233-62 (and references cited therein); Franz, U.S. Patent No. 3,950,402; Hershman, U.S. Patent No. 3,969,396; Pelthouse, U.S. Patent No. 4,582,650; Chou, U.S. Patent NOB. 4,624,937 and 4,696,772; Ramon et al., U.S. Patent No. 5,179,228; Ebner et al., U.S. Patent No. 6,417,133; and Leiber et al,, U.S. Patent No. 6,586,621.<br>
A high concentration of formaldehyde in the reaction product mixture resulting from the oxidative cleavage of an N-(phosphonomethyl)iminodiacetic acid substrate is undesirable.  In particular, the formaldehyde by-product is undesirable because it tends to react with the N-(phosphonomethyl) glycine product to produce further imwanted by-products including N-methyl-N-(phosphonomethyl) glycine<br><br>
(NMG), which reduces N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine yield.  In addition, the formaldehyde by-product itself is undesirable ■ because of its potential toxicity.  See Smith, U.S. Patent No. 5,606,107.<br>
Franz, U.S. Patent No. 3,950.,402, discloses oxidizing the formaldehyde by-product to carbon dioxide and water simultaneously with the oxidative cleavage of the N-(phosphonomethyl) iminodiacetic acid substrate by using a heterogenous oxidation catalyst comprising a noble metal deposited on a carbon support.  Such noble metal on carbon oxidation catalysts are referred to as "bifunctional" as the carbon component provides the primary adsorption site for the oxidation of the N-{phosphonomethyl) iminodiacetic acid substrate to form the N-(phosphonomethyl) glycine product and formaldehyde, while the noble metal component provides the primary adsorption site for the oxidation of formaldehyde and formic acid to form carbon dioxide and water. The noble metal component may also tend to reduce the rate of deactivation of the catalyst (i.e., prolong the useful life of the catalyst) .  The overall reaction is summarized as follows:<br><br>
However, under typical conditions of the oxidation reaction, some of the noble metal in the catalyst used by Franz is oxidized into a more soluble form and both the N-(phosphonomethyl) iminodiacetic acid and N-(phosphonomethyl) glycine product act as chelating ligands that tend to solubilize the noble metal.  Thus, even though the process disclosed by Franz produces an acceptable yield and purity of N-(phosphonomethyl) glycine, high losses of the costly noble metal by dissolution into the aqueous reaction<br><br>
solution (i.e., leaching) undermine the economic feasibility of the process.<br>
Ramon et al., U.S. Patent No. 5,179,228, disclose a process for the preparation of N-(phosphonomethyl) glycine by oxidation of N-(phosphonomethyl) iminodiacetic acid using an oxygen-containing gas in the presence of a noble metal on an activated carbon catalyst.  Recognizing the problem of leaching attendant the use of a noble metal on carbon catalyst in the oxidation of an N-<br>
(phosphonomethyl) iminodiacetic acid substrate (noble metal losses as great as 30% are reported), Ramon et al. propose flushing the reaction mixture with nitrogen gas xmder pressure after the oxidation reaction is complete. According to Ramon et al., nitrogen flushing causes redeposition of soliibilized noble metal onto the surface of the carbon support and reduces the noble metal loss to less than 1%.  However, the amount of noble metal loss inciirred with this method is still unacceptable.  In addition, re-depositing the noble metal can lead to a loss of noble metal surface area which, in turn, decreases the activity of the catalyst.<br>
Using a different approach, Pelthouse, U.S. Patent No. 4,582,650, discloses using two catalysts: (i) an activated carbon to effect the oxidation of N-<br>
(phosphonomethyl) iminodiacetic acid into N-<br>
(phosphonomethyl)glycine; and (ii) a co-catalyst to concurrently effect the oxidation of formaldehyde into carbon dioxide and water.  The co-catalyst consists of an aluminosilicate support having a noble metal located within its pores.  The pores are sized to exclude N-<br>
(phosphonomethyl) glycine and thereby prevent the noble metal of the co-catalyst from being poisoned by 1S~<br>
(phosphonomethyl)glycine. According to Pelthouse, use of these.two catalysts together allows for the simultaneous oxidation of N- (phosphonomethyl) iminodiacetic acid to H-<br><br>
(phosphonomethyl) glycine euad of formaldehyde to ceirbon dioxide and water. This approach, however, suffers from several disadvantages:  (1) it is difficult to recover  the costly noble metal ■ from the aluminosilicate support for re¬use; (2) it is difficult to design the two catalysts so that the rates between them are matched; and (3) the carbon support, which has no noble metal deposited on its surface, tends to deactivate at a rate which can exceed 10% per cycle.<br>
More recently, attention has focused on developing bifunctional noble metal on carbon oxidation catalysts which resist noble metal leaching (i.e., exhibit improved compositional stability) and provide increased activity and/or selectivity, particularly with respect to oxidation of formaldehyde into carbon dioxide and water (i.e., increased formaldehyde activity).  Ebner et al., U.S. Patent No. 5,417,133, disclose "deeply reduced" noble metal on carbon catalysts containing various metal promoters for use in the oxidative cleavage of an N-<br>
(phosphonomethyl) iminodiacetic acid substrate and oxidation of other oxidizable reagents and methods for their preparation. Such deeply reduced catalysts exhibit remarkable resistance to noble metal leaching in aqueous, acidic, oxidation reaction media. As a result, the catalyst disclosed by Ebner et al. provides for substantially quantitative oxidation of N-(phosphonomethyl) iminodiacetic acid substrates to N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine products, while maintaining effective oxidation of the formaldehyde and formic acid by-products of the reaction for a prolonged period and/or over numerous oxidation cycles.  Still, the process of Ebner et al. typically does not eliminate all the formaldehyde and formic acid by-product and, consequently, also does not eliminate all the NMS. Accordingly, a need persists for improvements which might further reduce noble metal losses, provide increased catalyst stability, activity<br><br>
and/or selectivity, particularly in the oxidation of formaldehyde and other N-(phosphonomethyl) iminodiacetic acid st±&gt;strate oxidation by-products, and generally extend the useful life of such catalysts.<br>
Tellurium has been described as a promoter tnetal for use in liquid phase oxidation reactions.  For example, in WO 00/01707, Siebenhaar et al. describe oxidizing salts of N-(phosphonomethyl) iminodiacetic acid in the presence of a noble metal on carbon catalyst containing 0.5% to 10% of a doping metal based on the weight of the carbon support. Although the disclosure includes tellurium in a list of potential doping metals, the principal teaching of the reference is directed to the use of coiranercially prepared noble metal on carbon catalysts doped with bismuth or lead.<br>

Other objects and features of this invention will be in part apparent and in part pointed out hereinafter.<br>
DETAILED DESGRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
in accordance with the present, invention, it has been discovered that tellurium, particularly a relatively modest amount of tellurium, acts as an effective catalyst promoter when incorporated on the surface of carbon-supported, noble<br><br>
metal-containing oxidation catalysts used in liquid phase oxidation reactions. As defined herein, a "promoter" is a metal that tends to increase catalyst selectivity, activity and/or stability. A promoter may also reduce noble metal leaching from the noble metal on carbon catalyst.  Further, the present invention provides effective means for depositing tellurium at the surface of a noble metal on carbon catalyst precursor to prepare a stable, tellurium-promoted, oxidation catalyst.<br>
A.  The oacidation catalyst<br>
The catalyst of the present invention generally comprises tellurium and a noble metal at a surface of a carbon support.<br>
The carbon supports useful in the practice of the present invention are well known in the art and are described, for example, by Ebner et al.', U.S. Patent No. 6,417,133 and Leiber et al., U.S. Patent No. 6,586,621, which are incorporated herein by reference.  In particular, activated, non-graphitized carbon supports are preferred. These supports are characterized by high adsorptive capacity for gases, vapors and colloidal solids and relatively high specific surface areas.  The support suitably may be a carbon, char, or charcoal produced by means known in the art, for example, by the destructive distillation of wood, peat, lignite, coal, nut shells, bones, vegetable, or other natural or synthetic carbonaceous matter, but preferably is "activated" to develop adsorptive power. Activation usually is achieved by heating to high temperatures (e.g., from about 800" to about 900oC) with steam or with carbon dioxide which brings about a porous particle structure and increased specific surface area.  In some cases, hygroscopic substances, such as zinc chloride and/or phosphoric acid or sodium sulfate, are added before the destructive distillation or activation, to increase adsorptive capacity.<br><br>
Preferably, the carbon content of the carbon support ranges from about 10% for bone charcoal to about 98% for some wood chars and nearly 100% for activated carbons derived from organic polymers. The non-carbonaceous matter in coummercially available activated carbon materials normally will vary depending on such factors as precursor origin, processing and activation method. Many commercially available carbon siipports contain small araoiints of metals. Carbon supports having the fewest oxygen-containing functional groups at their surfaces are most preferred.<br>
The form of the carbon support is not critical.  In one embodiment of this invention, the support is a monolithic support.  Suitable monolithic supports may have a wide variety of shapes. Such a support may be, for example, in the form of a screen or honeycomb.  Such a support may also, for exanple, form part of the reactor structure (e.g., an impeller or baffle) in which the liquid phase oxidation is conducted.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment, the support is in the form of particulates.  Because particulate supports are especially preferred, most of the following discussion focuses on embodiments which use a particulate support.  It should be recognized, however, that this invention is not limited to the use of particulate supports.<br>
Suitable particulate supports may have a wide variety of shapes.  For exanple, such supports may be in the form of pellets, granules and powders.  Pellet supports typically have a particle size of from about 1 mm to about 10 mm. Preferably, the support is in the form of a powder.  These particulate supports may be used in a reactor system as free particles suspended in the liquid reaction medium, or, . alternatively, may be bound to a suitable structure in the reactor system, such- as a baffle, screen or an impeller.<br><br>
Typically, a support which is in particulate form comprises a broad size distribution of particles.  For powders, preferably at least eibout 95% of the particles are from about 2 to about 300 ]3.m  in their largest dimension, more preferably at least about 98% of the particles are from about 2 to about 200 um in their largest dimension, and most preferably about 99% of the particles are from about 2 to about 150 urn in their largest dimension with about 95% of the particles being from about 3 to about 100 pm in their largest dimension.  Particles greater than about 200 iim in their largest dimension tend to fracture into super-fine particles (i.e., less than 2 p.m in their largest dimension), which are difficult to recover.<br>
The specific surface area of the carbon support, measured by the Birunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method using Nj, is preferably from about 10 to about 3,000 m^/g (surface area of carbon support per gram of carbon support), more preferably from about 500 to about 2,100 trf'/g, and still more preferably from about 750 to about 2,100 m^/g.  In some embodiments, the most preferred specific surface area is from about 750 to about 1,750 mVS-<br>
Carbon supports for use in the present invention are commercially available from a number of sburces.  The following is a listing of some of the activated carbons which may be used in the practice of the present invention-.

Code 1551 (Baker and Adamson, Division of Allied Amer. Norit Co., Inc., Jacksonville, FL) ; Grade 235, Grade 337, Grade 517, and Grade 256 {Witco Chemical Corp., Activated Carbon Div., New York, NY); and Columbia SXAC (Union Carbide New York, NY).<br>
The catalyst has one or more noble metals at its surface. Preferably, the noble metal is selected from the group consisting of platinum (Pt) , palladium (Pd) , ruthenium (Ru) , rhodium (Rh) , iridium (Ir) , silver (Ag) , osmium (Os) , gold (Au) and combinations thereof.  In general, platinum is most preferred. Because platinum is presently the most preferred noble metal, the following discussion will be directed primarily to embodiments using platinum.  It should be understood, however, that the same discussion is generally applicable to the other noble metals and combinations thereof.  It also should be understood that the term "noble metal" as used herein is meant to include the noble metal in its elemental state as well as the noble metal in any of its various oxidation states.<br>
The concentration of the noble metal deposited at the surface of the carbon support may vary within wide limits. Preferably, the noble metal is deposited at the support surface in a concentration of from about 0.5% to about 20% by weight of the catalyst (i.e., [mass of noble metal -s-total mass of catalyst] x 100%), more preferably from about 2.5% to about 10% by weight of the catalyst, and most prefereibly from about 3% to about 7.5% by weight of the catalyst.  Per example, in accordance with a preferred embodiment, the catalyst comprises from about 3% to about 7.5% by weight platinum, and especially about 5% hy  weight platinxim, at the surface of the carbon support.  In embodiments wherein the catalyst is intended to catalyze the oxidation of an N-(phosphonomethyl) iminodiacetic acid substrate, noble metal concentrations less than about 0.5% by weight of the catalyst tend to significantly reduce<br><br>
formaldehyde oxidation rate and, as a result, increase HMG production, thereby reducing the N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine product yield.  On the other hand, at noble metal concentrations greater than about 20% by weight of the catalyst, layers and clunps of noble metal tend to form. Thus, there are fewer surface noble metal atoms per total amount of noble metal used. This tends to reduce the activity of the catalyst and is an uneconomical use of the costly noble metal.<br>
The dispersion of the noble metal at the surface of the carbon support preferably is such that the concentration of surface noble metal atoms is from about 10 to about 400 pmole/g (umole of surface noble metal atoms per gram of catalyst) , TOore preferably, from about 10 to about 150 lamole/g, and most preferably from about 15 to about 100 lamole/g. This may be determined, for example, by meastiring chemisorption of Hj or CO using a Micromeritics ASAP 2010C (MicromeriticB, Norcross, GA) or an Altamira AMIIOO (Zeton Altamira, Pittsburgh, PA) .<br>
Preferably, the noble metal is at the surface of the carbon sxipport in the form of metal particles. At least about 90% (number density) of the noble metal particles at the surface of the carbon support are preferably from about 0.5 to about 35 nm in their largest dimension, more preferably from about 1 to about 20 nm in their largest dimension, and most preferably from about 1.5 to about 10 nm in their largest dimension.  In a particularly preferred embodiment, at least about 80% of the noble metal particles at the surface of the carbon support are from about 1 to about 15 nm in their largest dimension, more preferably from about 1.5 to about 10 nm in their largest dimension, and most preferably from about 1.5 to about 7 nm in their largest dimension.  If the noble metal particles are too small, there tends to be an increased amount of leaching when the catalyst is used in an environment that tends to<br><br>
solubillze noble metals, as is the case when oxidizing an N-(phosphonomethyl) iminodiacetic acid substrate to form an N-(phoBphonomethyl)glycine product. On the other hand, as the particle size increases, there tends to be fewer noble metal atoms at the surface per total amount of noble metal used. As discussed above, this tends to reduce the activity of the catalyst and is uneconomical.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the amoimt of tellurium at the surface of the carbon support (whether associated with the carbon surface itself, other metal, or a combination thereof) generally constitutes less of the overall catalyst composition as compared to conventional practice, for example, as taught by Siebenhaar'et al. in WO 00/01707.  The weight percentage of tellurium is typically from about 0.02% to about 0.25% by weight of the catalyst (i.e., [mass of tellurium -s- total mass of the catalyst] X 100%) .  In applications wherein the catalyst is utilized in the liquid phase oxidation of an N-<br>
(phosphonomethyl) iminodiacetic acid substrate, it is important to note that catalysts containing higher amounts of tellurium are generally less preferred.  As discussed in greater detail below, experience to date suggests that higher amoxmts of tellurium may diminish the rate of the primary reaction (i.e., the oxidative cleavage of a carboxymethyl substituent from an N-<br>
(phosphonomethyl) iminodiacetic acid substrate) to a level which renders the process impractical. Thus, for such applications, tellurium preferably constitutes from about 0.02% to about 0.175% by weight of the catalyst, more preferably from about 0.02% to about 0.125% by weight of the catalyst, even more preferably from about 0.02% to about 0.1% by weight of the catalyst, still more preferably from about 0.02% to about 0.08% by weight of the catalyst, and especially from about 0.04% to about 0.08% by weight of the catalyst. For exatnple, in accordance with an especially<br><br>
preferred embodiment, tellurium at the surface of the carbon support constitutes about 0.075% by weight of the catalyst.<br>
In certain embodiments of the present invention, the oxidation catalyst comprises tellurium and one or more other promoter metals in addition to the noble metal at the surface of the carbon support.  The promoter metal may, for example, be an additional noble metal at the surface of the carbon support.  For example, depending on the application, ruthenium and palladium may act as promoter metals on a catalyst comprising platinum deposited at a carbon support surface. Alternatively, the promoter metal may be, for example, selected from the group consisting of iron (Fe), bismuth (Bi) , tin (Sn) , cadmium (Cd) , magnesium (Mg), manganese (Mn) , nickel (Ni), aluminum (Al), cobalt (Co), lead (Pb), titanium (Ti), antimony (Sb), selenium (Se), rheniiim (Re) , zinc (2n) , cerium (Ce) , zirconium (Zr) , germanium (Ge) and mixtures thereof.<br>
Tellurium and any other promoter metal (s) may be present at the surface of the carbon support in their elemental state as well as in any of their various oxidation states.  Preferably, the tellurium and'any other promoter metal (s) are more easily oxidized than the noble metal.  In instances where the promoter metal is a noble metal as well, the promoter metal noble metal preferably is more easily oxidized than the non-promoter noble metal. A promoter metal is "more easily oxidized" if it has a lower first ionization potential than the noble metal.  First ionization potentials for the elements are widely Imown in the art and may be found, for example, in the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics (CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, Florida).<br>
The amotmt of the promoter metal other than tellurium at the surface of the carbon support (whether associated with the carbon siirface itself, other metal, or a combination thereof) may vary within wide limits depending on, for example, the noble metals and promoter metal(s)<br><br>
employed. Typically, when tellurium is combined with one or more promoter metals at the surface of the catalyst, the other promoter metal (B) is present in an amount of at least about 0.05% by weight of the catalyst (i.e., tmasB of promoter metal + total mass of the catalyst] X 100%) . Preferably, the other promoter metal constitutes from about 0.05% to about 10% by weight of the catalyst, more preferably from about 0.1% to about 10% by weight of the catalyst.  Still more preferably, the other promoter metal at the surface of the carbon support constitutes from about 0.1% to about 2% by weight of the catalyst and especially from about 0.2% to about 1.5% by weight of the catalyst. Generally, promoter metal concentrations of less tlian about 0.05% by weight do not provide beneficial effects (e.g., increased catalyst activity or selectivity) over an extended period of time.  On the other hand, amounts greater than about 10% by weight tend to degrade the activity of the catalyst.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, particularly in applications where the oxidation catalyst is utilized in the liquid phase oxidation of an N-(phosphonomethyl) iminodiacetic acid substrate, formaldehyde and/or formic acid, the catalyst conprises platinum, tellurium and iron at the surface of the carbon support.  Iron promoted catalysts are preferred in such applications because they tend to exhibit the greatest activity and stability with respect to formaldehyde and formic acid oxidation. In such embodiments, it is preferred that platinum constitutes from about 0.5% to about 20% by weight of the catalyst, tellurium constitutes from about 0.02% to about 0,175%, more preferably from about 0.02% to about 0.125% by weight of the catalyst and iron constitutes from about 0.1% to about 1.5% by weight of the catalyst. More preferably, platinum constitutes from about 3% to about 7.5% by weight of the catalyst, tellurium constitutes from about 0.02% to about 0.1%, even more preferably from about<br><br>
0.02% to about 0.08%, still more preferably from about 0.04% to about D.OB% by weight of the catalyst and iron constitutes from about 0.25% to about 1% by weight of the catalyst.  For exanple, in accordance with an especially preferred etnboditnent, platinum constitutes about 5% by weight of the catalyst, tellurium constitutes about 0.075% by weight of the catalyst and iron constitutes about 0.5% by weight of the catalyst.<br>
B.  Preparation of the Oacidation Catalyst<br>
The oxidation catalyst of the present invention may be prepared by depositing tellurium over an oxidation catalyst precursor comprising a noble metal at the surface of a carbon support.  Generally, tellurium deposition onto the catalyst precursor may be achieved by many techniques known in the art.  Such methods include liquid phase methods such as reaction deposition techniques (e.g., deposition via reduction of metal coTttpoionds and deposition via hydrolysis of metal coTt5&gt;ounds), ion exchange techniques, excess solution impregnation and incipient wetness impregnation; vapor phase methods such as physical deposition and chemical deposition; precipitation; electrochemical deposition; and electroless deposition.  See generally, Ebner et al., U.S. Patent No. 6,417,133, Leiber et al., U.S. Pgitent KTo. 6,586,621 and Cameron et al., "Carbons as Supports for Precious Metal Catalysts," Catalysis Today. 7, 113-137 (1990) .<br>
1. Oxidative Deposition of Tellurjum.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, it has been discovered that conventional metal deposition technicjues may not provide optimum results when depositing tellurium, particularly with respect to metal dispersion and adhesion. Experience to date suggests that conventional techniques used to deposit tellurium onto a catalyst precursor<br><br>
comprising a noble metal such as platinum at the surface of a carbon support achieve varying and sotnetitneB unsatisfactory results with respect to the dispersion of tellurium at the surface of the precursor and retention of tellurium as the catalyst is subsequently used to catalyze liquid phase oxidation reactions.  Thus, the present invention provides an ittfiroved method for delivering and depositing tellurium onto the surface of a noble metal on carbon catalyst precursor so as to provide a substantially uniform dispersion of telluriiim stably fixed to the catalyst surface.<br>
In contrast to some conventional methods used to deposit metals in catalyst preparation, it has been surprisingly discovered that tellurium is advantageously deposited onto a catalyst precursor under oxidative conditions.  In particular, it has been discovered that oxidative conditions are better at stably "fixing" tellurium at the surface of the catalyst precursor than reductive deposition techniques which attempt to deposit tellurium in its elemental state.  Depositing tellurium at the surface of a catalyst precursor under oxidative conditions provides a tellurium-promoted, noble metal on carbon catalyst that does not lose a significant amomit of tellurium upon use in liquid phase oxidation reactions. Without being bound to a particular theory, it is believed that tellurium-promoted catalysts prepared under oxidative conditions exhibit less tellurium leaching because telluriiim is deposited onto the surface of the catalyst precursor in the form of one or more tellurium species which are better able to fix or adhere to the catalyst surface than elemental tellurium.  It is believed that tellurium may be deposited in a variety of forms under oxidative conditions that are generally less soluble in liquid phase oxidation reaction media.  For example, tellurium deposited onto the precursor under oxidative conditions may be present at the surface of the<br><br>
catalyst in the form of ionized telluri-um or oxygenated or oxidized tellurium such as tellurium dioxide (TeO^) or mixtures of such species. Furthermore, it is believed that depositing telltsri-um under oxidative conditions in accordance with the present invention is effective to uniformly disperse deposited tellurium species on the noble metal at the surface of the catalyst precursor.  Oxidative deposition may preferentially deposit tellurium onto the noble metal and other metals present at the surface of the catalyst precursor such that at least about 40%, preferably at least about 50%, more preferably at least about 75%, still more preferably at least about 90%, even more preferably at least about 95% and especially substantially all of the deposited tellurium atoms are associated with or bound to metals at the surface of the catalyst precursor as opposed to being deposited on the carbon support.<br>
In one embodiment, the process for oxidative deposition of tellurium generally comprises combining an oxidation catalyst precursor and a source of tellturium in a liquid medium to form an oxidation catalyst precursor slurry. An oxygen-containing gas is introduced into the catalyst precursor slurry such that tellurium is transported to and deposited on a surface of the catalyst precursor under oxidative conditions to form a tellurium-promoted oxidation catalyst.<br>
The oxidation catalyst preciirsor may take a variety of forms and preferably comprises a noble metal at the surface of a carbon support in a proportion selected so as to provide an oxidation catalyst of the desired composition. If the catalyst is to include one or more promoter metals in addition to tellurium, it is preferred that the tellurium be deposited over a catalyst precursor comprising appropriate quantities of the noble metal and promoter metal (s) at the surface of a carbon support.  For example, the catalyst precursor may comprise a noble metal alloyed with one or<br><br>
more non-tellurium promoter metals to form alloyed metal particles. As used herein, the term "alloy" encompasses any metal particle con^rising a noble metal and at least one promoter metal, irrespective of the precise manner in which the noble metal and promoter metal atoms are disposed within the particle.  The alloyed metal particles need not have a uniform composition and the compositions may vary from particle to particle, or even within the particles themselves, although it is generally preferable to have a portion of the noble metal atoms at the surface of the alloyed metal particle.' The catalyst precursor may comprise particles at the sxirface of the carbon support comprising noble and promoter metal alloys of various types, including intermetallic compounds, substitutional alloys, multiphasic alloys, segregated alloys and interstitial alloys. However, rather than an alloy, the catalyst precursor may comprise particles consisting of the noble metal alone and/or the non-tellurium promoter metal (s) alone at the surface of the carbon support.  Nevertheless, it is preferred, although not essential, that the majority of noble metal atoms at the surface of the catalyst precursor be alloyed with any non-tellurium promoter metal present, and more preferred that siibstantially all of the noble metal atoms be alloyed with the promoter metal (s) employed. If the promoter metal is a noble metal as well, the non-promoter noble metal is likewise preferably alloyed with the promoter metal noble metal. As an example, the catalyst precursor over which tellurium is deposited may suitably comprise a pre-formed, "deeply reduced" noble metal or noble metal/promoter metal alloy on carbon catalyst as described by Ebner et al. , U.S. Patent No. 6,417,133 and Leiber et al., U.S. Patent No. 6,58S,621, the entire disclosures of. which are incorporated herein by reference. However, there are a variety of alternative preparative techniques known in the art which may be used to form a multi-metallic, carbon supported<br><br>
catalyst precursor and the present invention is not limited in this respect.  See, for example, V. Ponec &amp;.  G.C. Bond, Catalysis by Metals and Alloys. "Studies in Surface Science and Catalysis," Vol. 95 (B. Delmon. &amp; J.T. Yates, advisory eds., Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, Netherlands).<br>
Alternatively, the catalyst precursor may comprise a used noble metal on carbon oxidation catalyst (i.e., an oxidation catalyst that has been used previously in catalyzing one or more oxidation reactions) .  For example, the activity and/or desired selectivity of a catalyst typically decreases with use over several reaction cycles. In particular, in the context of the liquid phase oxidation of N-(phosphonomethyl) iminodiacetic acid substrates, the activity of a carbon-supported, noble metal-containing catalyst with respect to oxidation of formaldehyde and formic acid by-products often tends to slowly decrease as the catalyst is used, thereby causing less formic acid and/or formaldehyde to be destroyed and, consequently, a greater amount of NMG to be produced.  Eventually, this activity will decrease to an unacceptable level and the catalyst mass must be replaced. However, in accordance with the present invention, such a used or spent catalyst may be reinvigorated (i.e., the activity and/or selectivity of the catalyst for oxidizing an N-(phosphonomethyl) iminodiacetic acid substrate to produce an N- (phosphonomethyl) glycine product can be increased to an acceptable level) by depositing tellurium onto the surface of the used catalyst precursor.  In other words, tellurium can be deposited onto the surface of a used catalyst to modify and improve catalyst performance and extend the useftil life of the catalyst.<br>
A variety of tellurium sources may be combined with the catalyst precursor in the catalyst precursor slurry.  For exanqple, suitable tellurium sources generally include any inorganic or organic tellurium compounds containing<br><br>
tellurium atoms at an oxidation level greiater than 0 (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6) , most preferably 4.  Exatnples of suitable tellurium cottipounds include tellurium cxides (e.g., TeO2, Te2O3, Te2O5, TeO, and the like) ; tellurium salts of inorgamic hydracids including, for example, tellurium tetrachloride (TeCl,) , tellurium tetrabromide (TeBr^) , tellurium tetraiodide (Tel^) and the like; tellurium salts of inorganic oxy-acids including, for exan?)le, tellurious acid (HaTeO3) , telluric acid (HsTeO3 or Te(OH)g), telltirium nitrate (TeiO^'HNO3) and the like; and miscellaneous other organic and inorganic tellurium coTr5)ovmds including, for exanple, dimethyl tellurium dichloride, lead tellurium oxide, tellurium isopropoxide, ammonium tellurate, tellurium thiourea and the like. Preferably, the source of tellurium comprises a tellurium oxide or tellurium salt of an inorganic hydracid. More preferably, the tellurium compound is tellurium dioxide (TeO3) , tellurium tetrachloride (TeCl^) , or telluric acid (Te(0H)6)» with tellurium dioxide being most preferred.<br>
In general, the liquid medium for the catalyst precursor slurry may comprise any suitable liquid selected to be cott5&gt;atible with the tellurium source and the catalyst precursor.  Suitable liquids for use in preparing the catalyst precursor slurry include, for exanple, water and aqueous solutions of formaldehyde and/or formic acid.  The catalyst precursor slurry is preferably formed using water as the liquid medium in which the catalyst preciorsor particles are suspended.<br>
Cfhelating agents capable of forming coordination compounds with tellurium in the catalyst precursor slurry are disadvantageous in that they tend to sequester tellurium and inhibit transport of tellurium to the surface of the catalyst precursor during oxidative deposition. Accordingly, it is preferred that the catalyst precursor slurry be maintained substantially free of such chelants.<br><br>
That is, the concentration, of any chelating agent capalsle of forming coordination compounds with telliirium in the precursor slurry is sufficiently low so as to not inhibit substantially quantitative delivery of tellurium to the surface of the catalyst precursor. Most preferably, the catalyst precursor slurry is devoid of any chelant capable of binding tellurium so as to better facilitate delivery of tellxorium to the surface of the catalyst precursor.<br>
The oxygen-containing gas introduced into the catalyst precursor slurry may be any gaseous mixture comprising molecular oxygen which optionally may comprise one or more diluents.  Exan^les of such gases are air, p\jre molecular oxygen, or molecular oxygen diluted with helium, argon, nitrogen, or other non-oxidizing gases. For economic reasons, the oxygen source is most preferably air or pure molecular oxygen.  The oxygen-containing gas may be introduced into the catalyst precvirsor slurry by any suitable means, typically by introducing the gas into a vessel containing the slurry.  Preferably, the oxygen-containing gas is introduced into the slurry in a manner which facilitates intimate contact between the gas and catalyst precursor particles suspended in the liquid medium. Accordingly, oxygen-containing gas from a pressurized source may be introduced through a small orifice nozzle, sparger conduit, dip tube or similar device submerged in the catalyst precursor slxirry near the bottom of the vessel. Dispersion of the oxygen-containing gas throughout the catalyst precursor slurry may be enhanced by agitating the slurry (e.g., with an impeller) so that the turbulence intimately mixes and distributes the oxygen-containing gas as it rises upward through the slurry. Alternatively or additionally, dispersion of the oxygen-containing gas in.the catalyst precursor slvirry may be enhanced by introducing the gas into the slurry through a diffuser such as a porous frit<br><br>
or by other means well-}cnovm to those skilled in the art for promoting gas-liquid phase contact.<br>
The rate at which the oxygen-containing gas is introduced into the liquid medivun can vary significantly. However, in order to ensure sufficiently oxidative conditions are maintained and to accomplish substantially quantitative tellurium deposition in a reasonable amount of time, the oxygen-containing gas is suitably introduced into the slurry at a rate of at least about 20 L/min/kg catalyst preCTirsor, preferably from about 20 to about 250 L/min/kg catalyst precursor, more preferably from about 30 to about 175 L/min/kg catalyst precursor and especially from about 40 to about 160 L/min/kg catalyst precursor.  Preferably, the dissolved oxygen concentration in the catalyst precursor slurry during oxidative deposition of tellurium is maintained near the saturation concentration. As a reference, the.saturation concentration of oxygen in water under standard conditions (25"C and one atmosphere) is about 8 ppm.  It should be  understood that in an alternative embodiment, introduction of an oxygen-containing gas into the catalyst precursor slurry can be avoided by adding the catalyst precursor and tellurium source to an oxygenated liquid medium having a dissolved oxygen concentration near the saturation concentration (e.g., a liquid medium previously sparged with an oxygen-containing gas) .<br>
The oxidative deposition process for depositing tellurium onto the' catalyst precursor may be conducted at any pressure including atmospheric, SIJD-atmospheric and super-atmospheric pressures. Oxidative deposition of tellurium is suitably carried out at a pressure at or near atmospheric pressure, although moderately pressurizing the catalyst precursor slurry using the oxygen-containing gas may enhance catalyst performance.  However, it is believed that pressures much in excess of about 90 psig would unnecessarily complicate the deposition process.<br><br>
Accordingly, if super-atmospheric pressures are employed, it is preferred that the catalyst precursor slurry be maintained at a pressure of no greater than about SO psig, more preferably at a pressiire no greater than about 50 psig, and most preferably at a pressure no greater than about 30 psig.<br>
It is important to note that the ten5&gt;erature of the catalyst precursor slurry appears to significantly effect tellurium deposition under oxidative conditions and later catalyst performance.  More particularly, experience to date suggests that tellurium is more stably deposited at the surface of the catalyst preciirsor xmder oxidative conditions at a temperature no greater than about SO^C. Accordingly, the temperature of the catalyst preciirsor slurry during introduction of the oxygen-containing gas is preferably no greater than about SO^C, more preferably no greater than about 40°C, and most preferably no greater than about SO^C. Without being bound to a particular theory, it is believed that lower catalyst precursor slurry temperatures slow the kinetics of tellurium deposition sufficiently to aid in fixing the tellurium to the precursor surface.<br>
Once the tellurium soairce is added to the catalyst precursor slurary, oxidative deposition is  allowed to continue for a time sufficient to achieve substantially quantitative deposition of tellurium on the surface of the catalyst precursor. Under the conditions disclosed herein, satisfactory results are typically obtained after about 3 0 minutes. At the end of the deposition cycle, the tellurium-promoted catalyst is separated from the slurry (e.g., by filtration).  Although the formed catalyst may be subjected to drying (e.g., under vacuum at BO°C with nitrogen sweep), drying is not necessary and the wet catalyst may be used immediately to catalyze the liquid phase oxidation reaction of interest.<br><br>
In aorae applications, the O3cidative deposition of tellurium can advantageously be performed using the reactor vessel and appurtenant apparatus employed in carrying out the lic[uid phase oxidation reaction. That is, a fresh tellurium-promoted, noble metal on carbon catalyst or a used catalyst reinvigorated by tellurium deposition may be prepared at the facility in which it is later put to use. For example, wherein a tellurium-promoted, noble metal on carbon catalyst is used in the liquid phase oxidation of an N-(phosphonomethyl)iminodiacetic acid substrate using an oxygen-containing gas as the oxidizing agent, the tellurium may be deposited onto the catalyst precursor within the reactor vessel prior to the introduction of the K-{phosphonomethyl) iminodiacetic acid substrate.  Such on-site catalyst preparation or regeneration provides a significant operational and cost advantage to traditional preparation methods which have required separate processing and/or equipment requirements. However, it is important to recognize that N-(phosphonomethyl)iminodiacetic acid stibstrates and the resulting N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine product act as tellurium chelating agents.  As noted above, such chelating agents tend to \mdermine the transport of tellurium to the catalyst precursor surface.  Accordingly, in such applications, care should be taken to avoid substantial contamination of the catalyst precursor slurry with either the N-(phosphonomethyl)iminodiacetic acid substrate or the K-(phosphonomethyl) glycine product during oxidative deposition of tellurium.<br>
2. Use of an FeyO^ Depoeition Agent<br>
In accordance with the present invention, processes for preparing tellurium-promoted, noble metal on carbon catalysts may include depositing tellurium onto the surface of a noble metal on carbon oxidation catalyst precursor in the presence of an iron oxide, particularly ferric oxide<br><br>
(FejO3) , deposition or dispersion enhancing agent.  In such an embodiment, the process con5)rises contacting an oxidation catalyst precursor and a source of tellurium as previously described along with FezOa in a liquid TOediutn to deposit tellurium on a surface of the catalyst precursor. Without being boimd to a particular theory, it is believed that F&amp;3P3 may act as an oxidizing agent that facilitates deposition and stably fixing tellurium species at the surface of the catalyst precursor that are generally less soliible in liquid ■ phase oxidation reaction media such as ionized tellurium or oxygenated or oxidized- tellurium such as tellurium dioxide (TeO3) .  Ferric oxide may also play a role in the slurry reaching the optimum electrochemical potential for tellurium deposition.<br>
The use of FejO3 as a tellurium deposition aid may be utilized in conjunction with many liquid phase deposition techniques including reaction deposition techniques (e.g., deposition via reduction of metal compounds and deposition via hydrolysis of metal compounds) , ion exchange techniques, excess solution ingsregnation, incipient wetness impregnation and electrochemical deposition techniques.  For example, FejO3 may facilitate deposition of tellurium using conventional reductive deposition technicjues in which the catalyst precursor and tellurium source are contacted in a liquid reducing medium comprising a suitable reducing agent such as an aqueous solution of formaldehyde, formic acid or a mixture thereof. Alternatively, FejO3 may be included as a component of the catalyst precursor slurry prepared in the oxidative deposition of tellurium as described above.  The amount of FejO3 combined with the catalyst precursor and tellurium source in the liquid medium is not narrowly critical. For example, suitable results are obtained if the quantity of FejOs is sufficient, to provide at least a substantially equiraolar or slight excess of iron relative to tellurium introduced into the liquid medium.  The other<br><br>
peirameterB of the ligaid phase deposition techniqae when FcaO3 is utilized as a telliirium deposition aid follow conventional practice well-known to those skilled in the art.<br>
3.   Sequential Depoeition Followed Bv Heat Treatment<br>
Another embodiment for preparing the tellurium-promoted, noble metal on carbon catalyst of the present invention coti^irises the sequential deposition of a noble metal and tellurium onto a carbon support followed by heat treating the formed catalyst. As with oxidative deposition, tellurium is preferably deposited onto a carbon support as described above having a noble metal and one or more non-tellurium promoter metals (e.g., a noble metal/promoter metal alloy) deposited thereon.<br>
In general, the sequential deposition of the noble metal, tellurium and any non-tellurium promoter metal(s) may be accomplished by any means generally known in the art for depositing metals onto a carbon support as described, for example, by Ebner et al., U.S. Patent No. 6,417,133, by Leiber et al., U.S. Patent No. 6,586,621, or by Cameron et al. in "Carbons as Supports for Precious Metal Catalysts," Catalysis Today, 7, 113-137 (1990).  As such, it is typically preferred that the noble metal and any promoter metal (s) be deposited onto the carbon support to form an oxidation catalyst precursor prior to deposition of tellurim.  More particularly, the oxidation catalyst precursor may comprise any carbon-supported, noble metal precursor generally described above including, for example, a pre-formed, "deeply reduced" noble metal or noble metal/promoter metal alloy on carbon catalyst as described by Ebner et al., U.S. Patent No. 6,417,133 and Leiber et al., U.S. Patent No. 6,586,621 or a used noble metal on carbon catalyst.<br><br>
In a certain preferred embodiment, tellTirium is preferably- deposited onto a promoted catalyst preciirsor.  In particular, the catalyst precursor is preferably a carbon support, which may or may not have a noble metal and/or a promoter deposited at its surface, and which has not been subjected to high temperature treatment. Thus, the tellurium is deposited onto the surface of the catalyst precursor prior to high temperature treatment.  In a particularly preferred embodiment, tellurium is deposited onto a catalyst precursor comprising a noble metal, preferably platinum, and a promoter, preferably iron, at a surface of a carbon support. Tellurium is preferably deposited onto the surface of the catalyst using a solution comprising a salt of tellurium in one of its more reduced oxidation states as described above. For example, a suitable salt that may be used to deposit tellurium is TeCl^. After tellurium deposition, the catalyst precursor is then subjected to high temperature treatment to form a tellurium-promoted, noble metal on carbon oxidation catalyst.  For exanple, after the carbon support has been impregnated with the noble metal(s), any other metal promoter(s) and tellurium, the catalyst may be subjected to a reductive heat treatment by heating the surface at a temperature of at least about 4O0'C.  It is especially preferable to conduct this heating in a non-oxidizing environment (e.g., nitrogen, argon, or helium) .  It is also more preferred for the temperature to be greater than about SOOOC.  Still more preferably, the temperature is from about 550° to about 1,200°C, and most preferably from about 550° to about 900°C. Fuxther details regarding such a reductive, poet-deposition heat treatment are disclosed by Ebner et al., U.S. Patent No. 6,417,133, the entire disclos-ore of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br><br>
C.  Pse of the Qacidation Catalyst<br>
The above-deecribed tellurixun-promoted, noble metal on carbon catalyst may be used to catalyze various liquid phase oxidation reactions. Examples of such reactions include the oxidation of alcohols and polyols to form aldehydes, ketones and acids (e.g., the oxidation of 2-propanol to form acetone and the oxidation of glycerol to form glyceraldehyde, dihydroxyacetone, or glyceric acid) ; the oxidation of aldehydes to form acids (e.g., the oxidation of formaldehyde to form foirmic acid and the oxidation of furfural to form 2-furan carboxylic acid); the oxidation of tertiary amines to form secondary amines (e.g., the oxidation of nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) to form iminodiacetic acid ("IDA")); the oxidation of secondary amines to form primary amines (e.g., the oxidation of IDA to form glycine); and the oxidation of various acids (e.g., formic acid or acetic acid) to form carbon dioxide and water.<br>
The above-described catalyst is especially useful in liquid phase oxidation reactions conducted at pH levels less than 7 and in particular, at pH levels less than 3.  It also is especially useful in the presence of solvents, reactants, intermediates, or products which tend soltibilize noble metals.  An example of such a reaction system is the preparation of an N-(phosphonomethyl) glycine product (i.e., N-(phosphonomethyl) glycine or a salt thereof) by catalytic oxidation of an N-(phosphonomethyl) iminodiacetic acid substrate, including the oxidation of the resulting formaldehyde and formic acid by-products in an aqueous reaction mixture.  Further, the catalyst of the present invention also has application in oxidizing formaldehyde and formic acid present in aqueous waste streams generated upon pvirification of the N-(phosphonomethyl) glycine product as disclosed, for example, by Smith, U.S. Patent No. 5,606,107 and by Leiber et al., U.S. Patent No. 5,586,521, the entire disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br><br>
Although the description below will disclose with particularity the use of the above-described tellurium-promoted, noble metal an carbon catalyst to effect the oxidative cleavage of a carboxymethyl substituent from an N-(phosphonomethyl) iminodiacetic acid sxibstrate and oxidation of the resulting formaldehyde and formic acid by-products, it should be recognized, that the principles are generally applicable to other liquid phase oxidative reactions, especially those conducted at pH levels less than 7 and those involving solvents, reactants, intermediates, or products which tend to solubilize noble metals.<br>
As noted above, the use of heterogenous, noble metal on carbon catalysts in the liquid phase oxidation of N-(phosphonomethyl) iminodiacetic acid siibstrates is well known.  Such catalysts are useful in catalyzing the concurrent reactions of (1) the oxidation of the N-(phosphonomethyl) iminodiacetic acid substrate to produce N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine; (2) the oxidation of formaldehyde by-product to produce formic acid; and (3) the further oxidation of formic acid to carbon dioxide and water.  The carbon component of the oxidation catalyst provides the primary adsorption site for the oxidation of the KT-(phosphonomethyl) iminodiacetic acid substrate to form the N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine product and formaldehyde, while the noble metal component provides the primary adsorption site for the oxidation of formaldehyde and formic acid to<br>
'ultimately form carbon dioxide and water.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, it has been<br>
• discovered that tellurium, particularly in the modest amounts deposited onto a noble metal on carbon catalyst as described above, can advantageously effect reaction systems for the liquid phase oxidation of N-<br>
. (phosphonomethyl) iminodiacetic acid substrates by balancing or matching the reaction rate of the primary reaction (i.e., reaction (1) above) with the reaction rates for the<br><br>
oxidation of the resulting by-products, formaldehyde and fonnic acid (i.e., reactions (2) and (3) above). Without being bound to a particular theory, it is believed that tellurium, especially modest amounts of tellurium, may slightly slow the oxidative cleavage of the N-(phosphonomethyl) iminodiacetic acid substrate as compared to conventional noble metal on carbon oxidation catalysts.  At the same time, the tellurium-promoted catalyst does not sxibstantially effect, or at least diminishes to a much lesser extent, the oxidation rate of the undesired formaldehyde and formic acid by-products produced.  In this manner, the catalyst of the present invention tends to equilibrate the rates of these concurrent reactions as conducted under the conditions described herein such that the formaldehyde and formic acid by-products are more effectively removed from the reaction medium as they are generated. As a result, less formaldehyde and formic acid are available in solution to participate in 'undesirable side reactions that decrease overall N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine product yield and compromise product purity.<br>
The amount of tellurium used in the oxidation catalyst of the present invention is important in controlling the rates of reaction as described above. For example, experience to date suggests catalysts having higher amounts of tellurium (i.e., tellurium in an aiiKJunt of more than about 0.25% by weight of the catalyst), may overly diminish the oxidation reaction rate of the N-<br>
(phosphonomethyl)iminodiacetic acid siibstrate.  Thus, in such applications, it is preferred that tellurium constitutes from about 0.02% to about 0.175% by weight of the oxidation catalyst, more preferably from about 0.02% to about 0.125% by weight of the catalyst, even more preferably from about 0.02% to about 0.1% by weight of the catalyst, still more preferably from about 0.02% to about 0.08% by weight of the catalyst, and especially from about 0.04% to<br><br>
aboiat 0.08% by weight of the catalyst. For exaicgple, it is believed that a platiniun on carbon oxidation catalyst promoted with about 0.7B% by weight tellurium is effective in balancing the rates of these aimultaneous oxidation reactions.<br>
As is recognized in the art, the liquid phase oxidation of N-(phosphonomethyl) iminodiacetic acid substrates may be carried out in a batch, sfemi-batch or continuous reactor system containing one or more oxidation reaction zones.  The oxidation reaction zone (s) may be suitably provided by various reactor configurations, including those that have back-mixed characteristics, in the liquid phase and optionally in the gas phase as well, and those that have plug flow characteristics.  Suitable reactor configurations having back-mixed characteristics include, for exatt^Jle, stirred tank reactors, ejector nozzle loop reactors (also known as venturi-loop reactors) and f luidized bed reactors. Suitable reactor configurations having plug flow characteristics include those having a packed or fixed catalyst bed {e.g., trickle bed reactors and packed bubble column reactors) and biobble slurry column reactors, Fluidized bed reactors may also be operated in a manner exhibiting plug flow characteristics. The configuration of the reactor system and the number of oxidation reaction zones is not critical to the practice of the present invention.  However, it is preferred that the oxidation reactor system enployed be adapted for use of a particulate catalyst suspended in the aqueous reaction mixture and include a filter to separate at least a portion of the N-(phosphonomethyl) glycine product from the reaction product mixture comprising the N-(phosphonomethyl) glycine product and the particulate catalyst such that the resulting catalyst slurry fraction comprising the particulate catalyst can be recycled and reintroduced into the oxidation reaction zone(s).<br><br>
Likewise, conditions, including temperature and pressure maintained in the oxidation reaction zone(s), reagent concentration, catalyst loading or concentration, reaction time, etc., suitable for liquid phase oxidative cleavage of a carboxymethyl substituent from an N-(phosphonomethyl) iminodiacetic acid substrate in an aqueous reaction mixture using an oxidizing agent such as an oxygen-containing gas in the presence of a noble metal on carbon catalyst are well known to those skilled in the art and the selection of these variables is not affected by the practice of the present invention.<br>
Oxidation of the N-(phosphonoTinethyl) iminodiacetic acid substrate may be conducted at a wide range of temperatures and at pressures ranging from sub-atmospheric to super-atmospheric.  Operating at higher temperatures and super-atmospheric pressures, while increasing plant costs, is preferred since such conditions tend to itrprove phase transfer between the liquid and gas phase and increase the oxidation reaction rate.  Moreover, the temperature within the oxidation reaction zone is preferably maintained sufficiently high with respect to the N-(phosphonomethyl) glycine product concentration such that essentially all the N-(phosphonomethyl) glycine product in the reaction product mixture is dissolved.  The temperature of the aqueous reaction mixture contacted with the oxygen-containing gas is suitably from about 80° to about 180'&gt;C, preferably from about 90° to about 15CC, and more preferably from about 95«&gt; to about 110"C.  The pressure maintained within the oxidation reaction zone(s) generally depends on the temperature of the aqueous reaction mixture. . Preferably, the pressure is sufficient to prevent the reaction mixture from boiling and is adequate to cause the oxygen from the oxygen-containing gas to dissolve into the reaction mixture at a rate sufficient such that oxidation of the N-(phosphonomethyl) iminodiacetic acid substrate is not<br><br>
limited due to an inadequate oxygen supply.  Suitable pressures range from about 30 to about 500 psig, and preferably from about 30 to about 130 psig. The concentration of the particulate, tellurium-promoted, noble metal on carbon catalyst and the N-<br>
(phosphonomethyl) iminodiacetic acid substrate in the aqueous reaction mixture are not critical.  Typically, the catalyst concentration is from about 0.1 to about 10% by weight ([mass of catalyst -r- total reaction mass] x 100%). Preferably, the catalyst concentration is from about 0.2 to about 5%, and more preferably from about 1 to about 4% by weight. Concentrations greater than about 10% are difficult to separate from the N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine product. On the other hand, concentrations less than about 0.1% tend to produce unacceptably low reaction rates.  The concentration of N-(phosphonomethyl) iminodiacetic acid substrate is preferably selected such that all reactants and the H-(phosphonomethyl) glycine product remain in solution so that the suspended particulate catalyst can be recovered for re¬use, for example, by filtration. Normally, the concentration of N-(phosphonomethyl) iminodiacetic acid substrate is up to about 25% by weight ([mass of N-(phosphonomethyl) iminodiacetic acid substrate ■¥  total reaction mass] x 100%) , and with respect to the preferred tenperatures of the aqueous reaction mixture, preferably from about 7 to about 15% by weight.  The pH of the aqueous reaction mixture is typically less than about 7 and often in the range of from about 1 to about 2.  When conducted in a continuous reactor system, the residence time in the oxidation reaction zone can vary widely depending on the specific catalyst employed, catalyst concentration and other conditions.  Typically, the residence time can vary over the range of from about 3 to about 120 minutes.  Preferably^ the residence time is from about 5 to about 90 minutes, and more preferably from about 5 to about 60 minutes.  When conducted<br><br>
in a batch reactor system, the reaction time typically varies over the range of from about 15 to about 120 minutes. Preferably, the reaction time is from about 20 to about 90 minutes, and more preferably from about 30 to about €0 minutes.<br>
The oxygen-containing gas used for oxidation of the N-(phosphonomethyDirainodiacetic acid si±istrate is any gaseous mixture comprising molecular oxygen which optionally may comprise one or more diluents which are non-reactive with the oxygen or with the substrate or oxidation product under the reaction conditions.  Exatttples of such gases are air, pure molecular oxygen, or molecular oxygen diluted with helium, argon, nitrogen, or other non-oxidizing gases.  For economic reasons, the oxygen source is usually air or pure molecular oxygen.  Preferably, the oxygen-containing gas coniprises at least about 95 mole% O3, typically approximately 9B mole% O3.  The oxygen may be contacted with the aqueous reaction mixture by any conventional means in a manner which maintains the dissolved oxygen concentration in the reaction mixture at the desired level and preferably in a manner which maximizes the contact of the gas with the reaction solution.  Such contact may be obtained, for example, by dispersing the gas through a diffuser such as a porous frit or sparger immersed in the reaction mixture.  The oxygen feed rate preferably is such that oxidation of the N-(phosphonomethyl) iminodiacetic acid substrate is not limited by oxygen supply, but not too high so as to lead to detrimental oxidation of the surface of the noble metal on carbon catalyst.<br>
Suitable reactor systems and oxidation reaction conditions for liquid phase catalytic oxidation of an N-(phosphonomethyl) iminodiacetic acid substrate are described, for example, by Ebner et al., U.S. Patent No. 6,417,133, by Leiber et al., U.S. Patent No.. 6,586,621, and by Haupfear et<br><br>
al., WO 01/92272, the entire disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
It should be recognized that the telluriutn-prorooted, noble metal on carbon oxidation catalyst in accordance with this invention may also be combined with other conventional heterogenous catalysts (e.g., a catalyst not containing tellurium) to form a catalyst mass useful in liquid phase oxidation reactions.  For example, a tellurium-promoted catalyst may be used to reinvigorate a used catalyst mass and extend the useful life thereof.  It should be further recognized that the catalyst of the present invention has the ability to be reused over several cycles (i.e. , it may be used to catalyze multiple batches of substrate) , depending on how oxidized its surface becomes with use. Even after the catalyst becomes heavily oxidized, it may be reused by being reactivated.  To reactivate a catalyst having a heavily oxidized surface, the surface may be first washed to remove the organics from the surface.  It may then be reduced in the same manner that a catalyst is reduced after metal deposition as described above.<br>

Eacan^le 6.    Use o£ a Pt/Fe/Te catalyst for the oxidation of K- (phosphonomethyl} iminodiacetic acid<br>
This example demonstrates the use of tellurium in the<br>
oxidation of N-(phosphonomethyl) iminodiacetic acid to<br>
prepare N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine.  The example comprised a<br>
comparison of four independent experiments for the oxidation<br>
of N- (phosphonomethyl) iminodiacetic acid in the presence of<br>
a Pt/Pe on carbon catalyst versus Pt/Fe/Te on "carbon<br>
catalysts prepared in accordance with Exan^ile 4 above.  The<br>
first experiment was conducted using a catalyst comprising<br>
5,0% by weight platinum and 0.48% by weight iron on a<br>
particulate carbon support. The second experiment was<br>
conducted using a catalyst coitprising 5.0% by weight<br>
platinum, 0,48% by weight iron and 0.083% by weight<br><br>
tellurium on a particulate carbon support prepared with deionized water as described in Example 4.  The third experiment was conducted using a catalyst con5&gt;rising 5.0% by weight platinum, 0.48% by weight iron suad 0.075% by weight tellurium on a particulate carbon support prepared with 0.5% formic acid solution as described in Example 4.  The fourth ejqperiment was conducted using a catalyst comprising 5.0% by weight platinum, 0.48% by weight iron and 0.075% by weight tellurium on a particulate carbon support prepared with 2.5% formaldehyde solution as described in Example 4.<br>
The oxidation reactions were conducted in a 1 liter stainless steel reactor (Autoclave Engineers) fitted with an agitator having an impeller located near the bottom of the autoclave.  A subsurface sintered metal frit situated below the inpeller was provided for introducing oxygen into the reactor. The reactor had an internal catalyst filter for separating the catalyst from the N-(phosphonomethyl) glycine product fraction withdrawn from the reactor at the conclusion of the oxidation reaction.<br>
Each reaction series included twelve (12) N-(phosphonomethyl) iminodiacetic acid batch oxidation reactions reusing the same catalyst charge.  For the first oxidation reaction in each series, the catalyst (2.5 g) and N-(phosphonomethyl) iminodiacetic acid (60,5 g) were charged to the reactor with make-up solution to 500 g total reaction mass (0.5% catalyst loading). The make-up solution contained 0.1% formaldehyde and 0.5% formic acid.  Fresh catalyst was used at the start of each reaction series. The iit5»eller speed was set at 1000 rpm. At zero time, 392 cmVminute of oxygen was introduced into the agitated aqueous reaction mixture at lOO^C and 110 psig. After about 28 minutes, the oxygen flow was dropped to 125 cm'/minute and . held at that rate for about 5 minutes past the point where the N-(phosphonomethyl) iminodiacetic acid was depleted. The catalyst was then separated from the reaction product<br><br>
mixture containing N-{phosphonometbyl) glycine to form an isolated catalyst slurry fraction and a product fraction. The isolated catalyst was then used in the next oxidation reaction in the aeries. This process was repeated for each reaction such that the initial catalyst charge was recovered and reused for each of the s-ubsequent 11 oxidation batch reactions in the series.<br>
The reaction product fraction from each reaction was analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) to determine the conposition with respect to the following: N-(phosphonomethyl) glycine (glyphosate) , formaldehyde (CSIjO) , formic acid (HCO2H) , N-(phosphonomethyl) iminodiacetic acid (PMIDA) , aminornethylphosphonic acid + W-<br>
methylaminoraethylphosphonic acid (AMPA + MAMPA), N-methyl-N-(phosphonomethyl) glycine (NMG) and iminodiacetic acid (IDA) . The results are reported in Tables 3 to 5 below.

Example 7.    Preparation and Use of a Pt/Pe/Te catalyst for N-(phoBphoxkOdDethyl) iminodiacetic acid oxidation<br>
This example demonstrates the preparation of a tellurium-promoted oxidation catalyst and its use in the oxidation of N-(phosphonomethyl) iminodiacetic acid to N-(phosphonomethyl) glycine as compared to a platinum-iron oxidation catalyst without tellurium.<br>
To prepare the tellurium-promoted catalyst, a catalyst precursor comprising 5.0% by weight platinum and 0.48% by weight iron on a particulate carbon support (2.5 g) was added to a 300 mL stainless steel reactor (Autoclave Engineers) fitted with an agitator and gas introduction through a subsurface sintered metal frit (below the agitator impeller) . The catalyst precursor was slurried in a solution of deionized water (176.4 g) and TeOs (0.0034 g) was added.  Oxygen was sparged into the reactor at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure while the catalyst precursor slurry was agitated at a rate of 500 rptn.  The rate of oxygen flow into the catalyst precxirsor slurry was 141 cm^/minute.  After 30 minutes, the flow of oxygen was stopped and the catalyst was filtered.  The catalyst remaining in the autoclave comprised 5.0% by weight platinum, 0.48% by weight iron and 0.075% by weight tellurium.<br>
The oxidation eacperiments comprised oxidizing N-(phosphonomethyl) iminodiacetic acid in a series of 30 individual batch reactions wherein the catalyst was re-used. For the first oxidation reaction in each series, the catalyst (3.6 g) and N-(phosphonomethyl)iminodiacetic acid (21.8 g) were charged to the reactor with make-up solution to 180 g total reaction mass (2.0% catalyst loading).  The make-up solution contained 0.1% formaldehyde and 0.5% formic acid. Fresh catalyst was used at the start of each reaction series.  The reactor was heated vinder nitrogen atmosphere to the operating temperature of lOO^C and the oxygen<br><br>
introduction began when the temperature had risen to about 970c. The tenperature was controlled at 100°C throughout the course of the reaction. Tlie agitator stirring rate was 900 rpm. The operating pressure was 90 psig oxygen during the reactions.  Oxygen was first introduced at the rate of 141 cm^/rainute for 28 minutes and then the flow was step-ratttped down to 45 cm^/minute for the remainder of the reaction. When the reaction was finished (oxidation of N-(phosphonomethyl) iminodiacetic acid is essentially con?)leted) the product was removed at the operating temperature by forcing it under pressure through a subsurface sintered metal frit, up the tubing and out of the autoclave through a valve and into a flask.  The product was then neutralized with ammonium hydroxide to keep the product from precipitating out of solution.  The isolated catalyst was then used in the next oxidation reaction in the series. This process was repeated for each reaction such that the initial catalyst charge was recovered and reused for each of the subsequent 29 oxidation batch reactions in the series. The reaction product fraction from each reaction was analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) to determine the composition with respect to the following: K-(phosphonoroethyl) glycine {glyphosate) , formaldehyde (CH2O), formic acid (HCO3H) , N- (phosphonomethyl) iminodiacetic acid (PMIDA), aminomethylphosphonic acid + N-<br>
methylaminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA + MAMPA) , N-methyl-N-(phosphonomethyl) glycine (NMG) and iminodiacetic acid (IDA) . The levels of reaction product impurities were compared to a benchmark 30-run reaction series using the platinum-iron catalyst precursor without tellurium.  Results are shown in Tables 7 and 8. Concentrations are in percent by weight. ND indicates "Not Detected." DBNQ indicates "Detected But Not Quantified."<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Example 8.    Preparation of a Pt/Fe/Te Catalyst Using Fe^Oa This example demonstrates the use of Fe^O^ in  depositing tell\iriuni onto a platinum-iron catalyst precursor to prepare a Pt/Fe/Te catalyst. To prepare the catalyst, a catalyst precursor cotrprising a 5.0% by weight platinum and 1.0% by weight iron on a particulate carbon support (6.0 g) and an aqueous solution of 0.5% formic acid {400 mL) was placed in a 3-necked round-bottom flask fitted with a thermometer and a condenser.  The catalyst precursor slurry was stirred by magnetic stirrer at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure.  TeO3 (0.0075 g) , PejO, (O.OOS g) and 10"' M formic acid (400 xciU)  were added.  The TeO3 and FejO3 were separately washed into the catalyst precursor slurry with a portion of the 10"^ M formic acid before the remaining formic acid was added.  The mixture was stirred overnight and vacuum filtered under nitrogen to recover the catalyst.  The catalyst was rinsed with 10'^ M formic acid solution (150 mL) , recovered and dried at 80°C linder vacuum with a nitrogen sweep. The recovered catalyst cotr5&gt;rised 5.0% by weight platinum, 1.0% by weight iron and 0.1% by weight tellurium.<br>

The catalyst precursor slurry was stirred by magnetic stirrer at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure.  TeOa (0.00375 g) , FejO3 (0.005 g) and 10"* M formic acid (400 mL) were added.  The TeO3 and FejO3 were separately washed into the catalyst precursor slurry<br><br>
with a portion of the 10"^ M formic acid before the remaining formic acid was added.  The mixture was stirred overnight and vacuum filtered under nitrogen to recover the catalyst. The catalyst was rinsed with 10"^ M formic acid solution (150 TrtL) , recovered and dried at 80'&gt;C under vacuum with a, nitrogen sweep.  The recovered catalyst coit^irised 5.0% by weight platinum, 1.0% by weight iron and 0.05% by weight tellurium.<br>
Sxaa^le  10.   Use of a Pt/Fe/Te catalyst for the oxidation of N- (phosphonamethyl) iminodiacetic acid<br>
This example demonstrates the use of tellurium as a<br>
surface promoter for the oxidation of N-<br>
(phosphonomethyl) iminodiacetic acid.  The example compares independent eaqperiments for the oxidation of N-<br>
(phosphonomethyl) iminodiacetic acid in the presence of catalysts comprising platinum and iron versus catalysts comprising platinum, iron and tellurium as prepared in Examples 8 and 9 above.  The first experiment was conducted using a catalyst comprising 5.0% by weight platinum and 1.0% by weight iron on a particulate carbon support.  The second experiment was conducted using the catalyst of Example 8 comprising 5.0% by weight platinum, 1.0% by weight iron and 0.1% by weight tellurium on a particulate carbon support. The third experiment was conducted using the catalyst of Example 9 comprising 5.0% by weight platinum, 1.0% by weight iron and 0.05% by weight tellurium on a particulate carbon support.<br>
Each experiment conprised oxidizing W-<br>
(phosphonomethyl) iminodiacetic acid in a series of six (6) individual batch reactions wherein the catalyst was re-used. For the first oxidation reaction in each series, the catalyst (0.9 g) and N-(phosphonomethyl) iminodiacetic acid<br>
(21.8 g) were charged to the reactor with make-up solution to 180 g total reaction mass (0.5% catalyst loading).  The<br><br>
make-up solution contained 0.1% formaldehyde and 0.5% formic acid. Fresh catalyst was used at the start of each reaction series. The reactor was heated under nitrogen atmosphere and oxygen introduction began when the tenperature had risen to about SVC.  The temperature was controlled at lOO^C throughout the course of the reaction.  The agitator stirring rate was 900 rpm.  The operating pressure was 90 psig. Oxygen was first introduced at the rate of 141 cm'/minute for 28 minutes and then the flow was step-ramped down to 45 cm'/minute for the remainder of the reaction. When the reaction was finished, the product was removed at the operating temperature by forcing it under pressure through a subsurface sintered metal frit, up the tubing and out of the autoclave through a valve and into a flask. The product was then neutralized with ammonium hydroxide to keep the product from precipitating out of solution.  The isolated catalyst was then used in the next oxidation reaction in the series.  This process was repeated for each reaction such that the initial catalyst charge was recovered and reused for each of the svibseguent 5 oxidation batch reactions in the series.<br>
The reaction product fraction from each reaction waa analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) to determine the conposition with respect to the following: N-(phosphonomethyl) glycine (glyphosate) , formaldehyde (CHjO) , formic acid (HCO3H), N-(phosphonomethyl) iminodiacetic acid (PMIDA), aminomethylphosphonic acid + N-<br>
methylaminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA + MAMPA), N-methyl-N-(phosphonomethyl) glycine (NMG) and iminodiacetic acid (IDA) . Results are shown in Tables 9  to 11.

Exantple 11.    Deposition of Tellurium onto a Used Catalyst<br>
This example describes the preparation and use of a tellurium-promoted oxidation catalyst wherein the catalyst precursor coTttprises a used catalyst.  The catalyst was prepared by depositing tellurium onto a catalyst precursor coir^jrising an oxidation catalyst containing 5.0% by weight platinum and 0.5% by weight iron on a particiilate carbon support which had been previously used in 248 commercial batch reactions for the oxidation of N-(phosphonomethyl) iminodiacetic acid.<br>
The experiment comprised oxidizing N-(phosphonomethyl) iminodiacetic acid in a series of sixteen (16) individual batch reactions in a 300 mL stainless steel reactor (Autoclave Engineers) fitted with an agitator and gas introduction through a siabsurface sintered metal frit (below the agitator impeller). The first five oxidation reactions were completed with the used catalyst. After the fifth oxidation reaction, tellurium was deposited onto the catalyst as described below for use in the remainder of the oxidation reactions in the series.<br>
For the first oxidation reaction, the used catalyst (0.9 g) and N-(phosphonomethyl) iminodiacetic acid (21.8 g) were charged to the reactor with make-up solution to ISO g total reaction mass (0.5% catalyst loading).  The make-up solution contained 0.1% formaldehyde and 0.5% formic acid. The reactor was heated under nitrogen. When the temperature had risen to about 97°C,  oxygen was sparged into the reactor.  Oxygen was first introduced at the rate of 141 cmVminute for 2B minutes and then the flow was step-ranped down to 45 cm^/minute for the remainder of the reaction.  The temperature was controlled at 100°C throughout the course of the reaction.  The agitator stirring rate was 900 rpm.  The operating pressure was 90 psig. When the reaction was finished, the product was removed at the operating temperature by forcing it under pressure through a<br><br>
subsurface sintered metal frit, up the tubing and out of the autoclave through a valve and into a flask. The product was then neutralized with ammonium hydroxide to keep the product from precipitating out of solution.  The isolated catalyst was then used in the next oxidation reaction in the series. This process was repeated for each reaction such that the initial catalyst charge was recovered and reused for each of the oxidation batch reactions.<br>
After the fifth oxidation batch reaction, tellurium was deposited onto the used catalyst under oxidative conditions. The used catalyst remaining in the reactor served as the catalyst precursor which was slurried in deionized water (176.4 g) .  TeO3 (0.0027 g) was added and oxygen was sparged into the reactor at ambient tenperature and atmospheric pressure while the catalyst precursor slurry was agitated at a rate of 500 rpm. The rate of oxygen flow into the catalyst precursor slurry was 141 cmVminute.  The rate of oxygen flow into the catalyst precursor slurry was 141 cm^/minute.  After 30 minutes, the flow of oxygen was stopped and the catalyst was filtered.  The catalyst, which comprised 5.0% platinum, 0.46% iron and 0.06% tellurium, remained in the reactor and was used in conducting subsequent oxidation reactions 6 to IS.<br>
The reaction product fraction from each reaction was analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) to determine the composition with respect to the following: N-(phosphonomethyl) glycine (glyphosate) , formaldehyde {CE^O) , formic acid (HCOaH), N-(phosphonomethyl) iminodiacetic acid (PMIDA) , aminomethylphosphonic acid + N-methylarainomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA + MAMPA) and N-methyl-N-(phosphonomethyl) glycine (NMG) . Results are shown in Tables 9 to 11. Concentrations are in percent by weight. ND indicates "Not Detected." DBNQ indicates "Detected But Not Quantified."<br><br><br><br>

was heated to lOCC under pressure (60 psig) in a nitrogen<br>
atmosphere for 75 minutes. After heating, the slurry was<br>

water (150 g) .  The cake was then dried at 120'C under<br>
vacuum for 8 to 10 hours.  Drying produced a catalyst<br>
