Reaction of the anhydride of the formula (II) with between 1 and 10 equivalents, preferably 1 and 4 equivalents and especially 1 to 2 equivalents of an appropriately substituted amine (NHR^2) affords in the presence or preferably in the absence of a tertiary amine the desired benzamides of the formula (I) in excellent yields. The reaction may be carried out at temperatures between about -50 and 300°C, preferably -20 and 180°C, in solvents or mixtures of solvents such as but not limited to unsubstituted or substituted hydrocarbones such as unsubstituted or substituted aryls (e.g. alkylaryls or haloaryis) or unsubstituted or substituted alkyls (e.g. haloalkyls), esters and ethers, at atmospheric, reduced or increased pressure.<br>

a)	dipotassium 4-nitro-2-sulfobenzoate of the formula (III), wherein Q1 = Q2 = K, with phosphorous pentachloride in substance, or<br>
b)	potassium 4-nitro-2-sulfobenzoate of the formula (III), wherein Q1 = H, Q2 = K, with thionyl chloride in substance, or<br>
c)	4-nitro-2-sulfobenzoic acid of the formula (III), wherein Q1 = Q2 = H with acetyl chloride at reflux, by distillation at about 184°C or with phosphorous pentoxide as a melt.<br><br><br>
The anhydride of the formula (II) can also be obtained from the reaction of the diacid of the formula (III) with possibly up to 4 equivalents, preferably 1 to 2 equivalents of an activation reagent, preferably thionyl chloride or phosgene, possibly in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst, preferably benzyltriethylammonium chloride, and optionally in the presence an amide catalyst, preferably dimethyl formamide, and optionally in the presence a tertiary amine catalyst, preferably pyridine.

Surprisingly it was found that the anhydride of the formula (II) can also be obtained by reaction of a dichloride of the formula (IV) with a diacid of the formula (III). In this reaction the dichloride of the formula (IV) (or other doubly activated isomers or derivatives thereof such as disclosed in DE 2616611, see e.g. formula (V) therein) may, after removal of excess reagent by, for example but not limited to, distillation at or above atmospheric pressure or under vacuum, be reacted with fresh diacid of the formula (III) or a salt thereof, other carboxylic acids (RC02H, where R is C1-C8-alkyl)] or other molecules capable of supplying the necessary oxygen atom, such as sulfoxides or tertiary N-oxides, optionally in the presence of a tertiary amine, preferably pyridine. The reaction may be carried out in solvents or mixtures of<br><br>
solvents such as but not limited to: unsubstituted or substituted hydrocarbones such as unsubstituted or substituted aryls (e.g. alkylaryls or haloaryls) or unsubstituted or substituted alkyls (e.g. haloalkyls), carbonates, carbamates, amides, esters, ethers, nitriies and sulfones, at, above or below their boiling point at atmospheric, reduced or increased pressure, at temperatures between about 0°C to 300°C, preferably between 40°C to 150°C, to produce the anhydride of the formula (II) in excellent yield.<br>
The dichloride of the formula (IV) (or other doubly activated isomers or derivatives thereof such as disclosed in DE 2616611, see e.g. formula (V) therein) can be obtained e.g. by reaction of the free diacid of the formula (III) (Q1 = Q2 = H) or dipotassium salt of the formula (III) (Q1 = Q2 = K) with thionyl chloride or phosgene in the presence of amide catalyst, preferably dimethyl formamide (see eg. DE 2616611).<br><br>
Surprisingly the benzamides of the formula (I) of the present invention can also be obtained by direct reaction of a diacid of the formula (III) or a salt thereof,<br><br>
where in Q1 and Q2 are identical or different and are H or a cation like an alkali or alkaline earth metal cation, e.g. Li, Na, K, Mg or Ca or an ammonium- or. phosphoniumcation, e.g. R4N, R3NH, R2NH2t RNH3, NH4l R4P, wherein R are<br><br>
identical or different unsubstituted or substituted hydrocarbon radicals having 1 to 24 carbon atoms, e.g. C^C^-alkyl, C2-C18-alkenyl, C2-C18-alkynyl or C5-C18-cycloalkyl, each of the 4 latter radicals being unsubstituted or substituted by one or more radicals from the group consisting of halogen, C6-C10-aryl, CrC4-alkoxy, CrC4-haloalkoxy, CrC4-alkylthio, mono- and di-(CrC4-alkyl)-amino, cyano, azido, formyl, (CrC4-alkyl)-carbonyl, (C^C^alkoxyJ-carbonyt, C^C^alkylsulfinyl and CrC4-alkylsulfonyi, or R is phenyl which is unsubstituted or substituted by radicals from the group consisting of halogen, C^^-alkyl, CrC4-alkoxy, CrC4-haloalkyl, (^-(V haloalkoxy and nitro, with an appropriately substituted amine or a salt thereof, in the presence of an activation reagent, preferably thionylchloride.<br>
The reaction is carried out optionally in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst, preferably benzyltriethylammonium chloride, and optionally in the presence of a tertiary amine catalyst. The reaction may be carried out in substance or in solvents such as but not limited to unsubstituted or substituted hydrocarbones such as unsubstituted or substituted aryls (e.g. alkylaryls or haloaryls) or unsubstituted or substituted alkyls (e.g. haloalkyls), carbonates, carbamates, esters, ethers, nitriles and sulfones, at, above or below their boiling point at atmospheric, reduced or increased pressure, at temperatures between about 0°C to 300°C, preferably between 40°C to 150°C, and renders the benzamides of the formula (I) in excellent yields.<br>
The benzamides of the formula (I) may be isolated by techniques commonly practised in the laboratory and known to those skilled in the art such as filtration, or they may be further reacted without isolation. The benzamides of the formula (I) are valuable intermediates for the preparation of various products such as sulfonylareas intended for use in crop protection.<br>
For example, by hydrogenation the nitrobenzamides of the formula (I) can be converted into the corresponding aminobenzamides of the formula (V), wherein Q, R1 anJ R2 are defined as \u Tormula (I). The hydrogenation may be carried out with<br><br>
hydrogen or a hydrogen source such as cyclohexadiene, in the presence of a metal catalyst like: Pd/C, Pt/C, Ru/C or Raney-Ni alone or in combination, possibly in the presence of other metal derivatives such as the oxides of or the salts of the metals manganese, molybdenum, tungsten, iron and cobalt in which the metal is present as cation, oxoanion or polyoxoanion, in an inert solvent or solvent mixture thereof, such as but nor limited to: water, alcohols, ethers, carboxylic acids and ketones, alone or as mixtures, or as mixtures with the solvents used in the preparation of the benzamides of the formula (I), at temperatures between about -30°C to 300°C and preferably between -1Q°C and 150°C.<br>
The benzamides of the formula (I) may also be hydrogenated and subsequently or simultaneously (reductive acylation) be reacted with an acylating reagent. For instance the benzamides of the formula (1) may be reacted with hydrogen or a hydrogensource such as cyclohexadiene, in the presence of a) a metal catalyst like: Pd/C, Pt/C, Ru/C or Raney-Ni alone or in combination, possibly in the presence of other metal derivatives such as the oxides of or the salts of the metals manganese, molybdenum, tungsten, iron and cobalt in which the metal is present as cation, oxoanion or polyoxoanion, and b) an acylating agent such as formic acid and/or an C^Cg-carboxylic acid anhydride, optionally in other solvents or mixture of solvents, such as but not limited to: alkylaryi, aryl, carbonate, carbamate, ester, ether, haloalkyl, haloaryl, ketone, nitrile, suifones and water or an inert solvent or solvent mixture, such as but not limited to: unsubstituted or substituted hydrocarbones such as unsubstituted or substituted aryls (e.g. alkylaryls or haloaryls) or unsubstituted or substituted alkyls (e.g. haloalkyls), carbonates, carbamates, esters, ethers, ketones, nitriles and suifones, at temperatures between about -30°C to 300°C and preferably between -10°C and 150°C, to form the corresponding acylamido derivatives of the formula (VI), where Q, R1 and R2 are defined in formula (I) and A is an acyl radical, preferably a formyl radical or a C,-C8- hydrocarbyl-carbonyl radical, such as a branched or straight chain C^Cg-alkyl-carbonyl radical.<br><br><br>

Thereafter the excess reagent is removed by, for example but not limited to: distillation at or above atmospheric pressure or under vacuum, in solvents such as but not limited to unsubstituted or substituted hydrocarbones such as unsubstituted or substituted aryls (e.g. alkylaryls or haloaryls) or unsubstituted or substituted alkyls (e.g. haloalkyls), esters, carbonates and ethers, at or below their boiling point at atmospheric, reduced or increased pressure, at temperatures between about 0°C to 200°C, preferably between 50°C and 150°C.<br>
The compound of the formula (VII) may be isolated by techniques commonly practiced in the laboratory and to those skilled in the art such as filtration.

For example, by hydrogenation the sulfonamides of the formula (VIII) can be converted into the corresponding sulfonamides of the formula (V*), wherein R\R2, R4 and R5 are defined as in formula (VIII). The hydrogenation may be carried out with hydrogen or a hydrogen source such as cyclohexadiene in the presence of a metal catalyst like: Pd/C, Pt/C, Ru/C or Raney-Ni alone or in combination, possibly in the presence of other metal derivatives such as the oxides of or the salts of the metals manganese, moiybdanum, tungsten, iron and cobalt in which the metal is present as cation, oxoanion or polyoxoanion, in an inert solvent or solvent mixture thereof, such as but nor limited to: water, alcohols, unsubstituted or substituted hydrocarbones such as unsubstituted or substituted aryls (e.g. alkylaryls or haloaryls) or unsubstituted or substituted alkyls (e.g. haloalkyls), ethers, carbonates,<br><br>

For instance the sulfonamides of the formula (VIII) may be reacted with hydrogen or a hydrogensource such as cyclohexadiene in the presence of a) a metal catalyst like: Pd/C, Pt/C, Ru/C or Raney-Ni alone or in combination, possibly in the presence of other metal derivatives such as the oxides of or the salts of the metals manganese, molybdanum, tungsten, iron and cobalt in which the metal is present as cation, oxoanion or polyoxoanion, and b) an acylating reagent such as formic acid and/or an CrC8-carboxylic acid anhydride, optionally in other solvents or mixture of solvents, such as but not limited to: unsubstituted or substituted hydrocarbones such as unsubstituted or substituted aryls (e.g. alkylaryls or haloaryls) or unsubstituted or substituted alkyls (e.g. haloalkyls), carbonates, carbamates, esters, ethers, ketones, nitriles and suifones, at temperatures between about -30°C to 300°C and preferably between -10°C and 150°C, to form the corresponding acylamido derivatives of the formula (VI*), where R\ R2, R4 and R5 are defined as in formula (VIII) and A is an acyl radical, preferably a formyl radical or a CrC8 hydrocarbyl-carbonyl radical, such as a branched or straight chain C.-C^-alkvl-carbonvl radical.<br><br><br>
The sulfonamide of the formula (VIII) and the sulfonyl isocyanates of the formula (IX-A) and (IX-B) can be advantageously used to prepare in excellent yields sulfonylureas which exhibit herbicidal activity. Examples of herbicidal sulfonylareas are sulfonylareas of the formulas (XII) and (XIV) below, such as N-(4,6-dimethoxypyhmidin-2-ylaminocarbonyl)-2-(N,N-dimethylaminocarbonyl)-5-(N-methoxycarbonyiamino)benzenesulfonamide, N-(4,6-dimethoxypyrimidin-2-ylaminocarbonyl)-2-(N,N-dimethylaminocarbonyl)-5-(N-propionyl-amino)benzenesulfonamide sodium salt, N-(4,6-dimethoxypyrimidin-2-ylaminocarbonyl)-2-(N,N-dimethylaminocarbonyl&gt;-5-(N-<br>
formylamino)benzenesuIfonamide, N-(4,6-dimethoxypyrimidin-2-yiaminocarbonyi)-2-(N1N«dimethylaminocarbonyl)-5-(N-formylamino)benzenesulfonamide sodium salt or N-(4,6-dimethoxypyrimidin-2-yiaminocarbonyI)-2-(NfN-dimethylaminocarbonyl)-5-(N-methoxycarbonylamino)benzenesulfonamide. The sulfonylareas can form salts where the hydrogen of the -S02-NH- group is replaced by an agriculturally suitable cation. These salts are, for example, metal salts, in particular alkali metal salts or alkaline-earth metal salts, in particular sodium salts and potassium salts, or else ammonium salts or salts with organic amines. Likewise, salt formation can be carried out by adding an acid to basic groups, such as, for example, amino and alkylamino.
