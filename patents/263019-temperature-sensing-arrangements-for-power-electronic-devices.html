				<td>TEMPERATURE SENSING ARRANGEMENTS<br>
FOR POWER ELECTRONIC DEVICES<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to temperature sensing arrangements<br>
for power electronic devices. More particularly, the present invention relates<br>
to a cooling system for controlling the temperature of a power electronic<br>
device used to supply power to electric motors, such as AC electric motors<br>
utilized to drive vehicles.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) are semiconductor<br>
devices particularly suitable for use in power applications. IGBTs handle both<br>
high voltages and high currents with small die sizes and with relatively low<br>
"on" resistance. In addition, IGBTs can be switched rapidly, thereby making<br>
IGBTs useful as switches in three phase inverters for high power, alternating<br>
current motor applications, such as motors used to drive electric, hybrid and<br>
fuel cell vehicles.<br>
[0003] When providing alternating current to power hybrid and fuel cell<br>
vehicles, IGBTs are arranged in modules with each module having a plurality<br>
of IGBTs, for example, six IGBTs. Each IGBT generates heat when<br>
operating, and care should be taken to assure that the temperature of the IGBT<br>
does not become excessive.<br>
[0004] Accordingly, it is desirable to provide a cooling system for<br>
controlling temperature in a power electronic device. In addition, it is<br>
desirable to provide a system for monitoring temperature in at least one power<br>
electronic device providing alternating current to an AC motor of an<br>
automotive vehicle. It is further desirable to provide a substrate assembly that<br>
prevents excess temperatures from occurring. Furthermore, other desirable<br><br>
features and characteristics of the present invention will become apparent from<br>
the subsequent detailed description and the appended claims, taken in<br>
conjunction with the accompanying drawings and the foregoing technical field<br>
and background.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0005] A cooling system is provided for controlling temperature in a<br>
power electronic device. The inverter circuit includes a semiconductor having<br>
a major surface. The cooling system includes a temperature sensor coupled to<br>
the major surface of the semiconductor; and a control circuit coupled the<br>
temperature sensor. The control circuit is configured to reduce current to the<br>
inverter circuit when the temperature exceeds a predetermined temperature.<br>
[0006] A system is provided for monitoring temperature in at least one<br>
power electronic device providing alternating current to an AC motor of an<br>
automotive vehicle. The at least one power electronic device includes a<br>
semiconductor having a major surface, at least a portion of which is exposed.<br>
The system includes at least one base coupled to the exposed portion of the<br>
major surface of the semiconductor. A thermistor is electrically mounted on<br>
and electrically connected to the at least one base. A power control circuit is<br>
electrically connected to the thermistor for providing DC current to the<br>
semiconductor. The power control circuit reduces current to the<br>
semiconductor when the semiconductor exceeds a predetermined temperature.<br>
[0007] A substrate subassembly includes a ceramic wafer having first and<br>
second opposed metallized major faces; a first metal tab on the first metallized<br>
face that extends away from the ceramic wafer for electrical connection to a<br>
first terminal member; a semiconductor switching device electrically<br>
conductively bonded to the first metallized face; and a first ceramic layer<br>
bonded to a portion of the first metallized face adjacent the semiconductor<br><br>
switching device. The first ceramic layer includes a metallized upper surface.<br>
The substrate subassembly further includes a second metal tab on the<br>
metallized upper surface of the first ceramic layer that extends away from the<br>
ceramic wafer for electrical connection to a second terminal member; and a<br>
first metal layer conductively bonded to electrodes on an upper surface of the<br>
switching device and also to the metallized upper surface of the first ceramic<br>
layer. The substrate subassembly further includes a second ceramic layer<br>
bonded to the first metal layer and being disposed over the semiconductor<br>
switching device; and a second metal layer bonded to the second ceramic<br>
layer. A temperature sensor is coupled to the second ceramic layer. The<br>
temperature sensor is configured to measure the temperature of the<br>
semiconductor switching device.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF AN EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENT<br>
[0019] The following detailed description is merely exemplary in nature<br>
and is not intended to limit the invention or the application and uses of the<br>
invention. Furthermore, there is no intention to be bound by any expressed or<br>
implied theory presented in the preceding technical field, background, brief<br>
summary or the following detailed description.<br>
[0020] FIG. 1 is an exemplary vehicle 102 with an IC engine-electric<br>
hybrid drive 100. The hybrid drive 100 includes an internal combustion<br>
engine 104 and a three-phase, alternating current (AC) electric motor 106 to<br>
drive the wheels 110 of the vehicle 102. A transmission 108 is disposed<br>
between the internal combustion engine 104 and the AC electric motor 106 for<br>
transmitting the mechanical output of the internal combustion engine 104 and<br>
the AC electric motor 106 to the wheels 110. An electric generator 114 is<br>
coupled to and provides direct current to a power electronic device such as an<br>
inverter circuit 118. The inverter circuit 118 receives the direct current from<br>
the electric generator 114 and provides alternating current to the AC electric<br>
motor 106. The electric generator 114 is also coupled to and charges a battery<br>
116, bank of batteries or bank of capacitors. The electric generator 114 is<br><br>
further coupled to receive power from the internal combustion engine 104 or<br>
the AC electric motor 106. A vehicle controller 128 is disposed between the<br>
electric generator 114 and the inverter circuit 118 for controlling the current to<br>
the inverter circuit 118.<br>
[0021] A power splitter device 112 is disposed between the internal<br>
combustion engine 104 and the AC electric motor 106 and the transmission<br>
108, as well as between the AC electric motor 106 and the transmission 108<br>
and the electric generator 114. The power splitter device 112 determines<br>
whether the internal combustion engine 104 or the AC electric motor 106<br>
drives the transmission 108, and/or whether the internal combustion engine<br>
104 or the transmission 108 drives the electric generator 114.<br>
[0022] A speed controller 130 includes a foot pedal 132 that is coupled to<br>
the vehicle controller 128. The speed controller 130 provides a signal to the<br>
vehicle controller 128 to control the current to the inverter circuit 118 from<br>
the electric generator 114.<br>
[0023] The inverter circuit 118 is coupled to one or more temperature<br>
sensors 120 for monitoring the temperature of the inverter circuit 118. The<br>
temperature sensors 120 are coupled to a power limiting control circuit 122.<br>
When the temperature sensors 120 detect a temperature in the inverter circuit<br>
118 higher than a predetermined temperature, the power limiting control<br>
circuit 122 can limit the power to the inverter circuit 118 in order to prevent<br>
exceeding the predetermined operating temperature or reduce the temperature<br>
below the predetermined temperature. In an alternate embodiment, a switch<br>
can be provided to control current between the electric generator 114 and the<br>
inverter circuit 118.<br><br>
[0024] The inverter circuit 118 is further coupled to a heat sink 134 for<br>
cooling the inverter circuit 118. The heat sink 134 can be coupled to a radiator<br>
136 such that circulating fluid carries heat away from the heat sink 134. The<br>
heat sink 134 can also be cooled by air flowing over the heat sink 134. The<br>
vehicle 102 is merely one exemplary arrangement of an IC engine-electric<br>
hybrid drive 100. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that<br>
alternate IC engine-electric hybrid drive vehicles can be provided, with<br>
alternate arrangement of components, as well as additional or fewer<br>
components.<br>
[0025] FIG. 2 is a schematic view of a vehicle 103 similar to that of FIG.<br>
1, except that the vehicle 103 includes a fuel cell drive system 101 that utilizes<br>
a fuel cell 138 to power the three-phase AC electric motor 106. As in the<br>
vehicle 102 of FIG. 1, the transmission 108 is coupled to the AC electric<br>
motor 106 for transferring the mechanical output of the AC electric motor 106<br>
to the wheels 110. The inverter circuit 118 that supplies alternating current to<br>
the AC electric motor 106. The inverter circuit 118 is coupled to the fuel cell<br>
138 that supplies direct current to the inverter circuit 118. The vehicle<br>
controller 128 is disposed between the fuel cell 138 and the inverter circuit<br>
118 for controlling the current to the inverter circuit 118.<br>
[0026] As in FIG. 1, the speed controller 130 of FIG. 2 includes the foot<br>
pedal 132 that is coupled to the vehicle controller 128. The speed controller<br>
130 provides a signal to the vehicle controller 128 to control the current to the<br>
inverter circuit 118 from the electric generator 114.<br>
[0027] The inverter circuit 118 of FIG. 2 is coupled to one or more<br>
temperature sensors 120 for monitoring the temperature of the inverter circuit<br>
118. The temperature sensors 120 are coupled to a power limiting control<br>
circuit 122. When the temperature sensors 120 detect a temperature in the<br>
inverter circuit 118 higher than a predetermined temperature, the power<br><br>
limiting control circuit 122 can limit the power to the inverter circuit 118 to<br>
prevent exceeding the predetermined operating temperature or reduce the<br>
temperature below the predetermined temperature. In an alternate<br>
embodiment, a switch can be provided to control current from the fuel cell 138<br>
to the inverter circuit 118.<br>
[0028] The vehicle 103 is merely one exemplary arrangement of a fuel cell<br>
drive system 101. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that<br>
alternate fuel cell drive systems can be provided, with alternate arrangement of<br>
components, as well as additional or fewer components.<br>
[0029] FIG. 3 is a top, plan view of an exemplary dual module inverter<br>
circuit 118 as utilized in the vehicles of FIGS. 1 and 2. The inverter circuit<br>
118 is configured as a switch module 200 having six substrate subassemblies<br>
202a-202f. Other types of inverter modules may be used in place of the<br>
illustrated module 200.<br>
[0030] The module 200 has a terminal subassembly 204 that includes an<br>
emitter terminal 206 for substrate subassemblies 202a, 202b, 202c that form a<br>
first substrate subassembly group, a collector terminal 208 for substrate<br>
subassemblies 202d, 202e, 202f that form a second substrate subassembly<br>
group, and a common collector/emitter terminal 210 for both substrate<br>
subassembly groups 202a-c, 202d-f. Terminal subassembly 204 has a first<br>
row of coplanar contacts 212, 214 on one side, and a second row of coplanar<br>
contacts 216, 218 on the other side. The contact rows 212, 214; 216, 218 are<br>
parallel, as are the two groups of substrate subassemblies 202a-c, 202d-f. The<br>
contacts 212 are in low electrical resistance communication with emitter<br>
terminal 206 while the contacts 216 are in low electrical resistance<br>
communication with collector terminal 208. The contacts 214, 218 are also in<br>
low electrical resistance communication with collector/emitter terminal 210.<br>
Substrate subassembly tabs 220 of substrate subassemblies 202a-202c are<br><br>
welded to terminal subassembly contact areas 214; substrate subassembly tabs<br>
222 of substrate subassemblies 202a-202c are welded to terminal subassembly<br>
contact 212; substrate subassembly tabs 220 of substrate subassemblies 202d-<br>
202f are welded to terminal subassembly contact areas 216; and substrate<br>
subassembly tabs 222 of substrate subassemblies 202d-202f are welded to<br>
terminal subassembly contacts 218.<br>
[0031] The module 200 has a housing 224 with a heat conductive<br>
baseplate 226 having a coefficient of thermal expansion close to that of the<br>
substrates in the substrate subassemblies 202a-202f. The cover of housing 224<br>
is not shown to better illustrate the interior construction of the module 200.<br>
The housing 224 has two embedded lead frames 228, 230, portions of which<br>
are exposed within the module 200 for electrical connection. The housing 224<br>
also has two small connector areas 232, 234 that each include two Kelvin<br>
terminals and a gate voltage terminal. The gate voltage terminal for the<br>
substrate subassemblies 202a-202c is indicated by reference numeral 236.<br>
The gate voltage terminal for the substrate subassemblies 202d-202f is<br>
indicated by reference numeral 238. Filamentary wires 240 connect the gate<br>
voltage terminal 236 to the embedded lead frame 228, while filamentary wires<br>
242 connect the gate voltage terminal 238 to the embedded lead frame 230.<br>
Filamentary wires 244 connect the respective embedded lead frames 228, 230<br>
with each of substrate subassemblies 202a-202f to connect it with the<br>
respective gate voltage terminal 236, 238.<br>
[0032] FIG. 4 shows a partial isometric view of the module 200 of FIG. 3.<br>
The substrate subassemblies 202a-202f are shown mounted on the baseplate<br>
226. Three substrate subassemblies 202a-202c are soldered to the upper<br>
surface of the baseplate 226 on one side of the terminal subassembly 204,<br>
while three substrate subassemblies 202d-202f are soldered to the upper<br>
surface of the baseplate 226 on the other side of terminal subassembly 204.<br><br>
Each group of three substrate subassemblies 202a-c, 202d-f is disposed along<br>
a line parallel to the centerline of terminal subassembly 204. Also, the<br>
substrate subassemblies 202a-f are preferably similarly, and symmetrically,<br>
disposed on the baseplate 226 to obtain uniformity in cooling, and thereby<br>
uniformity in temperature during operation.<br>
[0033] FIG. 5 shows one of the IGBT substrate subassemblies 202a-202f<br>
(generically referred to as 202) and the temperature sensors 120 represented in<br>
FIGS. 1 and 2 in greater detail to provide one embodiment of the invention.<br>
FIG. 6 shows the substrate subassembly 202 in an exploded view without the<br>
temperature sensor 120 for clarity. FIG. 7 is a closer view of the temperature<br>
sensor 120, and FIG. 8 is a cross-sectional view of the temperature sensor 120<br>
of FIG. 7 along plane VIII-VIII.<br>
[0034] In the substrate subassembly 202, a wafer 300, which is about 0.5-1<br>
mm thick and about 25 mm long by about 19 mm wide, has metal foil layers<br>
302, 304 bonded to opposite sides thereto. As used herein, the terms bonded,<br>
soldered, and attached are used in their broadest sense, and in various<br>
embodiments, can be used as interchangeable processes. Larger and smaller<br>
wafers can also be provided. The wafer 300 is made of an insulating layer<br>
such as beryllium oxide, aluminum oxide, aluminum nitride, silicon nitride or<br>
boron nitride, while the foil layers 302, 304 are copper or aluminum having a<br>
thickness of about 0.25mm. Preferably, the foil layers 302, 304 are directly<br>
bonded to the wafer 300. The subassembly tab 220 is a unitary portion of the<br>
foil layer 302.<br><br>
[0035] A silicon semiconductor switching transistor 306, such as an IGBT<br>
or MOSFET, is bonded or adhered to a first portion of the foil layer 302, and a<br>
fast silicon semiconductor diode (SFD) 308 is bonded to a second portion of<br>
the foil layer 302. The SFD 308 provides a blocking diode across the emitter<br>
and collector terminals 206, 208 of the switching transistor 306 and is<br>
preferably made of a material substantially similar to the switching transistor<br>
306. In each substrate subassembly 202a-202f (FIGS. 3 and 4), an SFD 308 is<br>
paired with a switching transistor 306 and is in close thermal proximity<br>
thereto. Depending on the circuit layout, there may be a greater or fewer<br>
number of SFDs 308 for every transistor 306. A diode contact area 315 and<br>
ceramic wafer 313 form part of the SFD 308. The ceramic wafer 313 may<br>
have a metal layer on each side with similar coefficients of expansion to the<br>
ceramic wafer 313.<br>
[0036] A second, but smaller, ceramic wafer 310 is bonded to the foil<br>
layer 302. A third copper foil member 311 is bonded to the ceramic wafer 310<br>
and has the second tab 222 extending therefrom. The second tab 222 is<br>
insulated from the first tab 220 by the ceramic wafer 310.<br>
[0037] A metallic strip 312 serves as a conductor to contact areas of the<br>
switching transistor 306. A ceramic layer 314 having a window 316 is bonded<br>
to the metallic strip 312. A D-shaped disk 318 having a contact tab 320<br>
projecting through the window 316 is bonded to the ceramic wafer 314 and is<br>
connected to a trimmable resistor mounted on dielectric wafer 322 having a<br>
contact pad 324. The metallic strip 312 and the D-shaped disk 318 can be<br>
copper, together with the ceramic layer 314 form an interconnect system is<br>
more closely matches to the semiconductor 408 coefficient of thermal<br>
expansion as compared to conventional interconnects and layers. In other<br>
embodiments, the D-shaped layer 318 can be replaced with a metal layer<br>
approximately the same size as the ceramic layer 314.<br><br>
[0038] As is seen in FIG. 5 in combination with FIGS. 7 and 8, the<br>
temperature sensor 120 is comprised of a thermistor 326 that is soldered to a<br>
pair of foil bases 328, 330 that are, in turn, attached to the ceramic layer 314.<br>
The terms base and pad can be used interchangeably. The foil bases 328, 330<br>
are metal interconnects, each having a conductive surface 334 of foil copper or<br>
aluminum deposit, and a conductive surface 336 of foil copper or aluminum<br>
deposit. In an alternate embodiment, the thermistor 326 can be replaced with<br>
a thermocouple.<br>
[0039] The thermistor 326 has a conductive flange 340 at one end soldered<br>
to the conductive surface 334 of the foil base 328 and a conductive flange 342<br>
at the other end soldered to the outer conductive surface 334 of foil base 330.<br>
A first conductive lead 344 in the form of a filamentary wire is soldered or<br>
ultrasonically bonded to the conductive surface 334 of the foil bases 328 and<br>
to the contact pad 324. A second conductive lead 348 in the form of a<br>
filamentary wire is soldered or ultrasonically bonded to the conductive surface<br>
334 of the foil base 330 and to the contact pads 324 of the trimmable resistor<br>
322. Leads from the thermistor 326 are connected to the power limiting<br>
control circuit 122 (see FIGS. 1 and 2). In alternate embodiments, the foil<br>
bases 328 and 330 can be metallized ceramic interconnects.<br>
[0040] FIG. 9 shows a second embodiment of the heat sensing<br>
arrangement with elements similar to that shown in FIGS. 5-8. The switching<br>
semiconductor in FIG. 9 is configured as an IGBT die 400. Reference is<br>
additionally made to FIG. 10 that shows a closer view of a portion of the<br>
IGBT die 400 of FIG. 9.<br><br>
[0041] The IGBT die 400 is comprised of an oxide or nitride wafer 402,<br>
such as a beryllia wafer, which is metallized on an upper surface by a copper<br>
foil plate 404 and on a lower surface by a copper foil plate 406. A silicon<br>
semiconductor switching transistor 408 is soldered to the foil 404, and a first<br>
metal layer 410, such as copper or aluminum, serves to contact areas of the<br>
switching transistor chip 408. A ceramic layer 412 is attached to the first<br>
metal layer 410, and a second metal layer 414 is attached to the ceramic layer<br>
412. The second metal layer 414 serves to balance the lay up of the ceramic<br>
layer 412 and first metal layer 410 to prevent warping and additional stresses<br>
to semiconductor switching transistor 408. The second metal layer 414 has a<br>
window 416 that is aligned with a hole 418 through the ceramic layer 412 for<br>
contact access to the switching transistor 408.<br>
[0042] A diode 420 is mounted laterally with respect to the IGBT die 400<br>
and has a top copper layer 422. Between the IGBT die assembly 400 and the<br>
diode 420 are traces 424 extending over the copper layer 404 to the power<br>
limiting control circuit 122 (see FIGS. 1 and 2) for interrupting or reducing<br>
current to the inverter circuit 118 (see FIGS. 1 and 2). Each trace represented<br>
by reference number 424 can be unique for the temperature sensing circuit and<br>
gate signal 460.<br>
[0043] The temperature of the IGBT die 408 and diode 420 are measured<br>
with temperature sensors 426, 428, respectively. In a preferred embodiment,<br>
temperature sensors 426, 428 are thermistors but the temperature sensors 426,<br>
428 can alternatively be thermocouples, or other temperature sensing device.<br>
[0044] The temperature sensor 426 is mounted on two L-shaped traces 438<br>
and 440 in the second metal layer 414 of the 400. The U-shaped opening 430<br>
has legs 432, 434 separated by a bight 436. The L-shaped traces 438 and 440<br>
are spaced apart from one another by a gap 442. The L-shaped traces 438 and<br>
440 have short legs 444 and 446 and long legs 448 and 450. The short legs<br><br>
444 and 446 are soldered or bonded to end flanges 452 and 454 on the<br>
temperature sensor 426 while the long legs 448 and 450 have thin wire leads<br>
456 and 458 soldered or ultrasonically bonded to the traces 424 that are<br>
connected to the power limiting control circuit 122 (see FIGS. 1 and 2). When<br>
the temperature of the IGBT die 400 exceeds a predetermined level, the power<br>
limiting control circuit 122 (FIGS. 1 and 2) interrupts or limits current to the<br>
IGBT die 400. A separate thin wire lead 460 connects the foil layer 414 to the<br>
traces 424, for example, to transfer the gate signal of the IGBT die 400.<br>
[0045] The diode 420 also has a U-shaped opening 462 in the foil layer<br>
422 so that the temperature sensor 428 can directly monitor the temperature of<br>
the diode 420. Like the temperature sensor 426 on the IGBT die 400, the<br>
temperature sensor 428 is soldered or bonded to short legs 464 and 466 of pair<br>
of L-shaped traces 468 and 470. Long legs 472 and 474 have first ends of thin<br>
wire leads 476 and 478 soldered or ultrasonically bonded thereto, with second<br>
ends of the leads bonded to the traces 424 which are connected to the power<br>
limiting circuit 122 (see FIGS. 1 and 2).<br>
[0046] The temperature level at which current is interrupted is in the range<br>
of about 125°C to about 175°C and preferably about 150°C. Generally and as<br>
an example, the maximum operating temperature of silicon is about 175°.<br>
However, due to manufacturing variability and tolerance, the power limiting<br>
control circuit 122 of one embodiment of the present invention prevents the<br>
temperature from exceeding 150°. Other embodiments may include silicon<br>
and other materials rated for higher temperatures, for example, greater than<br>
200°C and greater than 300°C.<br><br>
[0047] In accordance one embodiment of the invention, the temperatures<br>
of the inverter circuits 118 are sensed on one side, i.e., the top sides, and the<br>
inverter circuits 118 are cooled on the bottom sides. Cooling is accomplished<br>
by the heat sink 134 shown in dotted lines in FIGS. 1-2, 5 and 9. The heat<br>
sink 134 are preferably cooled by fluid, which in one embodiment is air and in<br>
another embodiment, recirculated liquid. The liquid may be sprayed and<br>
recovered either before or after evaporation or may flow past the inverters in a<br>
liquid state and cooled by the radiator 136 of FIGS. 1 and 2.<br>
[0048] In another embodiment, the inverter circuit 118 illustrated in FIGS.<br>
1 and 2 can be a plurality of IGBT dies and diodes mounted on a single<br>
substrate. Temperature sensors can be provided on one or more of the IGBT<br>
dies and diodes. Moreover, although an inverter circuit 118 has been<br>
described, in alternate embodiments, the temperature sensors 120 can be<br>
mounted on any type of power electronic device.<br>
[0049] While at least one exemplary embodiment has been presented in<br>
the foregoing detailed description, it should be appreciated that a vast number<br>
of variations exist. It should also be appreciated that the exemplary<br>
embodiment or exemplary embodiments are only examples, and are not<br>
intended to limit the scope, applicability, or configuration of the invention in<br>
any way. Rather, the foregoing detailed description will provide those skilled<br>
in the art with a convenient road map for implementing the exemplary<br>
embodiment or exemplary embodiments. It should be understood that various<br>
changes can be made in the function and arrangement of elements without<br>
departing from the scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims<br>
and the legal equivalents thereof.<br><br>
