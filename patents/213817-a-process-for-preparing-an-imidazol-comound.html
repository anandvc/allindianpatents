				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a novel group of imidazole compounds, processes for the preparation thereof, the use thereof in treating cytokine mediated diseases and pharmaceutical compositions for use in such therapy.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Interleukin-1 (IL-1) and Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) are biological substances produced by a variety of cells, such as monocytes or macrophages. IL-1 has been demonstrated to mediate a variety of biological activities thought to be important in immunoregulation and other physiological conditions such as inflammation [See, e.g., Dinarello et al., Rev. Infect. Disease. 6 51 (1984)]. The myriad of known biological activities of IL-1 include the activation of T helper cells, induction of fever, stimulation of prostaglandin or collagenase production, neutrophil chemotaxis, induction of acute phase proteins and the suppression of plasma iron levels.<br>
There are many disease states in which excessive or unregulated IL-1 production is implicated in exacerbating and/or causing the disease. These include rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, endotoxemia and/or toxic shock syndrome, other acute or chronic inflammatory disease states such as the inflammatory reaction induced by endotoxin or inflammatory bowel disease; tuberculosis, atherosclerosis, muscle degeneration, cachexia, psoriatic arthritis, Reiter's syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, traumatic arthritis, rubella arthritis, and acute synovitis. Recent evidence also links IL-1 activity to diabetes and pancreatic 6 cells.<br>
Dinarello, J. Clinical Immunology. 5 (5), 287-297 (1985), reviews the biological activities which have been attributed to IL-1. It should be noted that some of these effects have been described by others as indirect effects of IL-1.<br>
Excessive or unregulated TNF production has been implicated in mediating or exacerbating a number of diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, rheumatoid spondylitis, osteoarthritis, gouty arthritis and other arthritic conditions; sepsis, septic<br>
shock, endotoxic shock, gram negative sepsis, toxic shock syndrome, adult respiratory distress syndrome, cerebral malaria, chronic pulmonary inflammatory disease, silicosis, pulmonary sarcoisosis, bone resorption diseases, reperfusion injury, graft vs. host reaction, allograft rejections, fever and myalgias due to infection, such as influenza, cachexia secondary to infection or malignancy, cachexia, secondary to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), AIDS, ARC (AIDS related complex), keloid formation, scar tissue formation, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, or pyresis.<br>
AIDS results from the infection of T'lymphocytes with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).   At least three types or strains of HIV have been identified, i.e., HIV-1, HIV-2 and HIV-3. As a consequence of HIV infection, T-cell mediated immunity is impaired and infected individuals manifest severe opportunistic infections and/or unusual neoplasms.   HIV entry into the T lymphocyte requires T lymphocyte activation. Other viruses, such as HIV-1, HIV-2 infect T lymphocytes after T Cell activation and such virus protein expression and/or replication is mediated or maintained by such T cell activation. Once an activated T lymphocyte is infected with HIV, the T lymphocyte must continue to be maintained in an activated state to permit HIV gene expression and/or HIV replication. Monokines, specifically TNF, are implicated in activated T-cell mediated HIV protein expression and/or virus replication by playing a role in maintaining T lymphocyte activation. Therefore, interference with monokine activity such as by inhibition of monokine production, notably TNF, in an HIV-infected individual aids in limiting the maintenance of T cell activation, thereby reducing the progression of HIV infectivity to previously uninfected cells which results in a slowing or elimination of the progression of immune dysfunction caused by HIV infection. Monocytes, macrophages, and related cells, such as kupffer and glial cells, have also been implicated in maintenance of the HIV infection. These cells, like T-cells, are targets for viral replication and the level of viral replication is dependent upon the activation state of the cells. [See Rosenberg et al.. The Immunopathogenesis of HIV Infection, Advances in Immunology, Vol. 57, (1989)]. Monokines, such as TNF, have been shown to activate HIV replication in monocytes and/or macrophages [See Poli, si al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 87:782-784 (1990)], therefore, inhibition of monokine production or activity aids in limiting HIV progression as stated above for T-cells.<br>
TNF has also been implicated in various roles with other viral infections, such as the cytomegalia virus (CMV), influenza virus, and the herpes virus for similar reasons as those noted.<br>
Interleukin-8 (IL-8) is a chemotactic factor first identified and characterized in 1987. IL-8 is produced by several cell types including mononuclear cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and keratinocytes. Its production from endothelial cells is induced by IL-1, TNF, or lipopolysachharide (LPS). Human IL-8 has been shown to act on Mouse,<br>
Guinea Pig, Rat, and Rabbit Neutrophils.  Many different names have been applied to IL-8, such as neutrophil attractant/activation protein-1 (NAP-1), monocyte derived neutrophil chemotactic factor (MDNCF), neutrophil activating factor (NAF), and T-cell lymphocyte chemotactic factor.<br>
IL-8 stimulates a number of functions in vitro. It has been shown to have chemoattractant properties for neutrophils, T-lymphocytes, and basophils. In addition it induces histamine release from basophils from both normal and atopic individuals as well as lysozomal enzyme release and respiratory burst from neutrophils. IL-8 has also been shown to increase the surface expression of Mac-1 (GDI lb/CD18) on neutrophils without de novo protein synthesis, this may contribute to increased adhesion of the neutrophils to vascular endothelial cells.   Many diseases are characterized by massive neutrophil infiltration. Conditions associated with an increased in EL-8 production (which is responsible for chemotaxis of neutrophil into the inflammatory site) would benefit by compounds which are suppressive of IL-8 production.<br>
IL-1 and TNF affect a wide variety of cells and tissues and these cytokines as well as other leukocyte derived cytokines are important and critical inflammatory mediators of a wide variety of disease states and conditions. The inhibition of these cytokines is of benefit in controlling, reducing and alleviating many of these disease states.<br>
There remains a need for treatment, in this field, for compounds which are cytokine suppressive anti-inflammatory drugs, i.e. compounds which are capable of inhibiting cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF.<br>

The compounds of Formula (I) and Formula (A) may be obtained by applying synthetic procedures, some of which are illustrated in Schemes I to XH herein. The synthesis provided for in these Schemes is applicable for the producing compounds of Formula (I) and Formula (A)having a variety of different RI, R2, and R4 groups which are reacted, employing optional substituents which are suitably protected, to achieve compatibility with the reactions outlined herein. Subsequent deprotection, in those cases, then affords compounds of the nature generally disclosed. Once the imidazole nucleus has been established, further compounds of Formula (I) or Formula (A) may be prepared by applying standard techniques for functional group interconversion, well known in the art.   In the synthetic procedures section discussed below, use of the term Formula (I) will also mean Formula (A) as they should be used interchangeably herein, except generally where indicated, as the noted procedures for making compounds of Formula (I) will also make compounds of Formula (A).<br>
For instance: -C(O)NRi3Ri4 from -CO2CH3 by heating with or without catalytic metal cyanide, e.g. NaCN, and HNR13R14 in CH3OH; -OC(O)R3 from -OH with e.g., C1C(O)R3 in pyridine; -NR10-C(S)NRi3Rl4 from -NHRl0 with an alkylisothiocyante or thiocyanic acid; NR6C(O)OR6 from -NHR6 with the alkyl chloroformate; -NR10C(O)NRi3Rl4 from -NHR10 by treatment with an isocyanate, e.g. HN=C=O or R10N=C=O; -NRio-C(O)R8 from -NHR10 by treatment with Cl-C(O)R3 in pyridine; -C(=NR10)NR13Rl4 from -C(NR13R14)SR3 with H3NR3+OAc' by heating in alcohol; -C(NR13R14)SR3 from -C(S)NR13R14 with R6-I in an inert solvent, e.g. acetone; -C(S)NRi3Ri4 (where Ri3 or R14 is not hydrogen) from -C(S)NH2 with HNR13R14-C(=NCN)-NR13Rl4 from -C(=NR13R14)-SR3 with NH2CN by heating in anhydrous alcohol, alternatively from -C(=NH)-NR13R14 by treatment with BrCN and NaOEt in EtOH; -NR10-C(=NCN)SRg from -NHRio by treatment with (R8S)2C=NCN; -NR10SO2R3 from -NHRio by treatment with C1SO2R3 by heating in pyridine; -NR10C(S)R3 from -NR10C(O)R8 by treatment with Lawesson's reagent [2,4-W,s(4-methoxyphenyl)-1,3,2,4-dithiadiphosphetane-2,4-disulfide]; -NR10SO2CF3 from -NHR6 with triflic anhydride and base wherein R3, R6, Rl0. Rl3 and R14 are as defined in Formula (I) herein.<br>
Precursors of the groups R1, R2 and R4 can be other R1, R2 and R4 groups which can be interconverted by applying standard techniques for functional group interconversion. For example a compound of the formula (I) wherein R2 is halo -substituted C1-10 alkyl can be converted to the corresponding C1-10 alkylN3 derivative by reacting with a suitable azide salt, and thereafter if desired can be reduced to the corresponding C1-10alkylNH2 compound, which in turn can be reacted with R18S(0)2X wherein X is halo (e.g., chloro) to yield the corresponding C1-10alkylNHS(0)2R18 compound.<br>
Alternatively a compound of the formula (I) where R2 is halo-substituted C1-10-alkyl can be reacted with an amine R13R14NH to yield the corresponding C1-10-alkylNR13Rl4 compound, or can be reacted with an alkali metal salt of R18SH to yield the corresponding C1-10alkylSR18 compound.<br>
(Scheme Removed)SCHEME I<br>
Referring to Scheme I the compounds of Formula (I) are suitably prepared by reacting a compound of the Formula (II) with a compound of the Formula (HI) wherein p is 0 or 2, R1, R2 and R4 are as defined herein, for Formula (I), or are precursors of the groups RI. R2 and R4, and Ar is an optionally substituted phenyl group, and thereafter if necessary converting a precursor of R1, R2 and R4 to a group RI, R2 and R4<br>
Suitably, the reaction is performed at ambient temperature or with cooling (e.g. -50° to 10°) or heating in an inert solvent such as methylene chloride, DMF, tetrahydrofuran, toluene, acetonitrile, or dimethoxyethane in the presence of an appropriate base such as 1,8-diazabicyclo [5.4.0.] undec-7-ene (DBU) or a guanidine<br>
base such as 1,5,7-triaza-bicyclo [4.4.0] dec-5-ene (TBD). The intermediates of formula (II) have been found to be very stable and capable of storage for a long time. Preferably, p is 2.<br>
Compounds of the Formula (II) have the structure:<br>
(Structure Removed)wherein p is 0, or 2; R4 is as defined for Formula (I) and Ar is an optionally substituted aryl as defined herein. Suitably, Ar is phenyl optionally substituted by C1-4alkyl, C1-4 alkoxy or halo. Preferably Ar is phenyl or 4-methylphenyl, i.e. a tosyl derivative.<br>
Reaction a compound of the Formula (II) wherein p = 2, with a compound of the Formula (III)-Scheme I gives consistently higher yields of compounds of Formula (I) than when p=0. In addition, the reaction of Formula (II) compounds wherein p = 2 is more environmentally and economically attractive. When p=0, the preferred solvent used is methylene chloride, which is environmentally unattractive for large scale processing, and the preferred base, TBD, is also expensive, and produces some byproducts and impurities, than when using the commercially attractive synthesis (p=2) as further described herein.<br>
As noted, Scheme I utilizes the 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions of an anion of a substituted aryl thiomethylisocyanide (when p=0) to an imine. More specifically, this reaction requires a strong base, such as an amine base, to be used for the deprotonation step. The commercially available TBD is preferred although t-butoxide, Li+ or Na+, or K+ hexamethyldisilazide may also be used. While methylene chloride is the prefered solvent, other halogenated solvents, such as chloroform or carbon tetrachloride; ethers, such as THF, DME, DMF, diethylether, t-butyl methyl ether; as well as acetonitrile, toluene or mixtures thereof can be utiltized. The reaction may take place from about -20° C to about; 40° C, preferably from about 0° C to about 23° C, more preferably from about 0° C to about 10° C, and most preferably about 4° C for reactions involving an R1 group of pyrimidine. For compounds wherein R1 is pyridine, it is recognized that varying the reations conditions of both temperature and solvent may be necessary, such as decreasing temperatures to about -50°C or changing the solvent to THF.<br>
In a further process, compounds of Formula (I) may be prepared by coupling a suitable derivative of a compound of Formula (DC):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein T1 is hydrogen and T4 is R4 , or alternatively TI is RI and T4 is H in which R1, R2 and R4 are as hereinbefore defined; with: (i) when TI is hydrogen, a suitable derivative of the heteroaryl ring R1H, under ring coupling conditions, to effect coupling of the heteroaryl ring RI to the imidazole nucleus at position 5; (ii) when T4 is hydrogen, a suitable derivative of the aryl ring R4H, under ring coupling conditions, to effect coupling of the aryl ring R4 to the imidazole nucleus at position 4.<br>
Such aryl/heteroaryl coupling reactions are well known to those skilled in the art. In general, an organometallic synthetic equivalent of an anion of one component is coupled with a reactive derivative of the second component, in the presence of a suitable catalyst. The anion equivalent may be formed from either the imidazole of Formula (IX), in which case the aryl/heteroaryl compound provides the reactive derivative, or the aryl/heteroaryl compound in which case the imidazole provides the reactive derivative. Accordingly, suitable derivatives of the compound of Formula (IX) or the aryl/heteroaryl rings include organometallic derivatives such as organomagnesium, organozinc, organostannane and boronic acid derivatives and suitable reactive derivatives include the bromo, iodo, fluorosulfonate and trifluoromethanesulphonate derivatives. Suitable procedures are described in WO 91/19497, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein.<br>
Suitable organomagnesium and organozinc derivatives of a compound of Formula (DC) may be reacted with a halogen, fluorosulfonate or triflate derivative of the heteroaryl or aryl ring, in the presence of a ring coupling catalyst, such as a palladium (O) or palladium (II) catalyst, following the procedure of Kumada et al., Tetrahedron Letters, 22, 5319 (1981). Suitable such catalysts include tetrakis-(triphenylphosphine)palladiumandPdCl2[l,4-bis-(diphenylphosphino)-butane], optionally in the presence of lithium chloride and a base, such as triethylamine. In addition, a nickel (II) catalyst, such as Ni(II)Cl2(l,2-biphenylphosphino)ethane, may also be used for coupling an aryl ring, following the procedure of Pridgen et al., J. Org. Chem, 1982, 47,4319. Suitable reaction solvents include hexamethylphosphor-amide. When the heteroaryl ring is 4-pyridyl, suitable derivatives include 4-bromo- and 4-iodo-pyridine and the fluorosulfonate and triflate esters of 4-hydroxy pyridine. Similarly, suitable derivatives for when the aryl ring is phenyl include the bromo, fluorosulfonate, triflate and, preferably, the iodo-derivatives. Suitable organomagnesium and organozinc derivatives may be obtained by treating a compound of Formula (DC) or the bromo<br>
derivative thereof with an alkyllithium compound to yield the corresponding lithium reagent by deprotonation or transmetallation, respectively. This lithium intermediate may then be treated with an excess of a magnesium halide or zinc halide to yield the corresponding organometallic reagent.<br>
A trialkyltin derivative of the compound of Formula (IX) may be treated with a bromide, fluorosulfonate, triflate, or, preferably, iodide derivative of an aryl or heteroaryl ring compound, in an inert solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, preferably containing 10% hexamethylphosphoramide: in the presence of a suitable coupling catalyst, such as a palladium (0) catalyst, for instance tetrakis-(triphenylphosphine)-palladium, by the method described in by Stille, J. Amer. Chem. Soc, 1987,109, 5478, US Patents 4,719,218 and 5,002,942, or by using a palladium (II) catalyst in the presence of lithium chloride optionally with an added base such as triethylamine, in an inert solvent such as dimethyl formamide. Trialkyltin derivatives may be conveniently obtained by metallation of the corresponding compound of Formula (DC) with a lithiating agent, such as s-butyl-lithium or n-butyllithium, in an ethereal solvent, such as tetrahydrofuran, or treatment of the bromo derivative of the corresponding compound of Formula (DC) with an alkyl lithium, followed, in each case, by treatment with a trialkyltin halide. Alternatively, the bromo- derivative of a compound of Formula (DC) may be treated with a suitable heteroaryl or aryl trialkyl tin compound in the presence of a catalyst such as tetrakis-(triphenyl-phosphine)-palladium, under conditions similar to those described above.<br>
Boronic acid derivatives are also useful. Hence, a suitable derivative of a compound of Formula (DC), such as the bromo, iodo, triflate or fluorosulphonate derivative, may be reacted with a heteroaryl- or aryl-boronic acid, in the presence of a palladium catalyst such as tetrakis-(triphenylphosphine)-palladiurn or PdCl2[l,4-2-bis-(diphenyl-phospnino)-butane] in the presence of a base such as sodium bicarbonate, under reflux conditions, in a solvent such as dimethoxyethane (see Fischer and Haviniga, Rec. Trav. Chim. Pays Bas, 84,439, 1965, Snieckus, V., Tetrahedron Lett., 29, 2135, 1988 and Terashimia, M, Chem. Pharm. Bull., 11,4755, 1985). Non-aqueous conditions, for instance, a solvent such as DMF, at a temperature of about 100°C, in the presence of a Pd(II) catalyst may also be employed (see Thompson W J et al, J Org Chem, 49, 5237, 1984). Suitable boronic acid derivatives may be prepared by treating the magnesium or lithium derivative with a trialkylborate ester, such as triethyl, tri-iso-propyl or tributylborate, according to standard procedures.<br>
In such coupling reactions, it will be readily appreciated that due regard must be exercised with respect to functional groups present in the compounds of Formula (DC). Thus, in general, arnino and sulfur substituents should be non-oxidised or protected.<br>
As illustrated in Scheme II below, compounds of Formula (I) may be prepared by treating a compound of Formula (X) thermally or with the aid of a cyclising agent such as phosphorus oxychloride or phosphorus pentachloride (see Engel and Steglich, Liebigs Ann Chem, 1978, 1916 and Strzybny etal., J Org Chem, 1963, 28, 3381). Compounds of Formula (X) may be obtained, for instance, by acylating the corresponding a-keto-amine with an activated formate derivative such as the corresponding anhydride, under standard acylating conditions followed by formation of the imine with R2NH2. The aminoketone may be derived from the parent ketone by examination and reduction and the requisite ketone may in turn be prepared by decarboxylation of the beta-ketoester obtained from the condensation of an aryl (heteroaryl) acetic ester with the R1COX component.<br>
(Scheme Removed)SCHEME H<br>
In Scheme III illustrated below, two (2) different routes which use ketone (formula XI) for preparing a compound of Formula (I). A heterocyclic ketone (XI) is prepared by adding the anion of the alkyl heterocycle such as 4-methyl-quinoline (prepared by treatment thereof with an alkyl lithium, such as n-butyl lithium) to an N-alkyl-O-alkoxybenzamide, ester, or any other suitably activated derivative of the same oxidation state. Alternatively, the anion may be condensed with a benzaldehyde, to give an alcohol which is then oxidised to the ketone (XI).<br>
(Formula Removed)In a further process, N-substituted compounds of Formula (I) may be prepared by treating the anion of an amide of Formula (XII):<br>
R1CH2NR2COH	(XE)<br>
wherein RI and R2 with:<br>
(a)	a nitrile of the Formula (XIII):<br>
R4CN	(XIV)<br>

(b)	an excess of an acyl halide, for instance an acyl chloride, of the Formula<br>
(XIV):<br>
R4COHal     •	(XIV)<br>
wherein R4 is as hereinbefore defined and Hal is halogen, or a corresponding anhydride, to give a bis-acylated intermediate which is then treated with a source of ammonia, such as ammonium acetate.<br><br>
(Scheme Removed) <br>
 (XII) SCHEME IV<br>
One variation of this approach is illustrated in Scheme IV above. A primary amine (R2NH2) is treated with a halomethyl heterocycle of Formula R1CH2X to give the secondary amine which is then converted to the amide by standard techniques. Alternatively the amide may be prepared as illustrated in scheme V by alkylation of the formamide with R1CH2X. Deprotonation of this amide with a strong amide base, such as lithium di-wo-propyl amide or sodium bis-(trimethylsilyl)amide, followed by addition of an excess of an aroyl chloride yields the bis-acylated compound which is then closed to an imidazole compound of Formula (I), by heating in acetic acid containing ammonium acetate. Alternatively, the anion of the amide may be reacted with a substituted aryl nitrile to produce the imidazole of Formula (I) directly.<br>
The following description and schemes are further exemplification of the process as previously described above in Scheme I The reaction of imines with tosylmethyl isonitriles was first reported by van Leusen (van Leusen, et al., /. Org. Chem. 1977, 42, 1153.) Reported were the following conditions: tert butyl amine(fBuNH2) in dimethoxyethane (DME), K2CO3 in MeOH, and NaH in DME. Upon re-examination of these conditions each was found produce low yields. A second pathway involving amine exchange to produce the t-butyl imine followed by reaction with the isocyanide to produce a 1-tBu imidazole was also operating. This will likely occur using any primary<br>
amine as a base. The secondary amines, while not preferred may be used, but may also decompose the isonitrile slowly. Reactions will likely require about 3 equivalents of amine to go to completion, resulting in approximately 50% isolated yields. Hindered secondary amines (diisopropylamine) while usable are very slow and generally not too effective. Use of tertiary and aromatic amines, such as pyridine, and triethylamine gave no reaction under certain test conditions, but more basic types such as DBU, and 4-dimethylamino pyridine (DMAP) while slow, did produce some yields and hence may be suitable for use herein.<br>
As depicted in Schemes V and VI below, the pyrimidine aldehydes of Scheme VII, can be condensed with a primary amine, to generate an imine, which may suitably be isolated or reacted in situ, with the desired isonitrile in the presence of a variety of suitable bases, and solvents as described herein to afford the 5-(4-pyrimidinyl)-substituted imidazoles, wherein R2 and R4 are as defined herein for Formula (I) compounds.<br>
One preferred method for preparing compounds of Formula (I) is shown below in Scheme VI. The imines, prepared and isolated in a separate step were often tars, which were hard to handle. The black color was also often carried over into the final product. The yield for making the imines varied, and environmentally less-acceptable solvents, such as CH2C12 were often used in their preparation.<br>
This reaction, wherein p=2, requires a suitable base for the reaction to proceed. The reaction requires a base strong enough to deprotonate the isonitrile. Suitable bases include an amine, a carbonate, a hydride, or an alkyl or aryl lithium reagent; or mixtures thereof.   Bases include, but are not limited to, potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate, primary and secondary amines, such as morpholine, piperidine, pyrrolidine, and other non-nucleophilic bases.<br>
Suitable solvents for use herein, include but are not limited to N,N-dimethyl-formamide (DMF), MeCN, halogenated solvents, such as methylene chloride or chloroform, tetrahydrofuran (THF), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), alcohols, such as methanol or ethanol, benzene, or toluene, or DME. Preferably the solvent is DMF, DME, THF, or MeCN, more preferably DMF. Product isolation may generally be accomplished by adding water and filtering the product as a clean compound.<br>

SCHEME V<br>
While not convenient for large scale work, addition of NaH to the isonitrile, perhaps with temperatures lower than 25 °C (in THF) are likely needed. Additionally, BuLi has also been reported to be an effective base for deprotonating tosyl benzylisonitriles at -50 °C. (DiSanto, R.; Costi, R.; Massa, S.; Artico, M. Synth. Commun. 1995,25,795).<br>
Various temperature conditions may be utilized depending upon the preferred base. For instance, tBuNH2/DME , K2CO3/MeOH, K2CO3 in DMF, at temperatures above 40 °C, the yields may drop to about 20% but little difference is expected between 0°C and 25 °C. Consequently, temperature ranges below 0 °C , and above 80 °C are contemplated as also being within the scope of this invention. Preferably, the temperature ranges are from about 0 °C to about 25 °C.<br>
As shown in Scheme VI below, the imine is preferably formed in situ in a solvent. This preferred synthesis, is a process which occurs as a one-pot synthesis. Suitably, when the primary amine is utilized as a salt, such as in the dihydrochloride salt in the Examples, the reaction may further include a base, such as potassium carbonate prior to the addition of the isonitrile. Alternatively, the piperidine nitrogen may be required to be protected for instance a t-butyl or ethyl carbamate or some other standard nitrogen protecting group. Reaction conditions, such as solvents, bases, temperatures, etc. are similar to those illustrated and discussed above for the isolated imine as shown in Scheme V. One skilled in the art would readily recognize that under some circumstances, the in situ formation of the imine may require dehydrating conditions, or may require acid catalysis.<br>

SCHEME VI<br>
Scheme Vn describes an alternative process for making 2-aminopyrimidine containing compounds of formula (I). In this particular instance, the methylthio moiety is oxidized to the methylsulfinyl moiety which is reacted with a suitable NH2Ra moiety. In cases in which NH2Ra is an aliphatic amine (such as in compounds of Formula (A)), the methylsulfinyl moiety may be displaced directly with NH2Ra at elevated temperatures. When Ra is an aromatic ring, (such as in compounds of Formula (I)), catalysis with trimethylaluminum may be required for displacement to occur. (Scheme Removed) <br><br>
Scheme VIIThe dialkoxy acetals of 2-methylthiopyrimidine 4-carboxaldehyde and various 2-aminopyrimidine 4-carboxaldehydes can be prepared by modification of the procedures of Bredereck et al. (Chem. Ber. 1964, 97, 3407) whose disclosure is incorporated by reference herein and depicted below in scheme VIII. Hydrolysis of the acetals to aldehyde using various known reaction conditions, such as formic acid, did not produce a satisfactory yields of the aldehydes. Development of novel hydrolysis procedures were, therefore, required and constitute another embodiment fo the present invention. These hydrolysis procedures are illustrated in scheme VIII and are detailed in example 1. The preferred method of hydrolysis of the above mentioned acetals involves heating at 40-50 °C in 3 N HCI for 18 to 24 h followed by neutralization with solid NaHCO3 and extraction with ethyl acetate. Evaporation of the solvent generally affords aldehyde suitable for direct irnine formation. Column chromatography on silical gel increases overall yields in some cases. Hydrolysis of 2-methylthiopyrimidine 4-carboxaldehyde dimethyl acetal using acetic acid (fresh) as solvent and concentrated H2SO4 under heating conditions, preferably a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid, also affords the desired aldehyde in high yield. Alternatively, 2-methylthiopyrimidine 4-carboxaldehyde dimethyl acetal and the various 2-aminopyrimidine 4-carboxaldehyde dimethyl acetals can be hydrolysed utilizing a two step acetolysis procedure. Treatment of the dialkoxy acetals with acetic anhydride containing a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid affords the mixed acyloxy-alkoxy acetals which can be converted to the corresponding aldehydes by treatment with either catalytic sodium methoxide in methanol or mild acid.<br>

Pyrimidine containing compounds of Formula (I) can alternatively be prepared by assembling the pyrimidine ring on an already intact imidazole framework. A specific example of this synthetic approach is illustrated in scheme IX. While the scheme depicts and example in which R2 is 4-piperdine and R4 is 4-fluorophenyl, the method is generally applicable to any R2 and R4 substituents claimed in Formula (I). Likewise, the method can be adapted to any substituted guanidine and, therefore, can be used to prepare any substitued pyrimidine moieties claimed for R1 in Formula (I).<br>
(Scheme Removed)Scheme IX<br>
The final 2-alkyl or arylaminopyrimidin-4-yl imidazole compounds of Formula (I), compounds can be prepared by one of four methods: 1) direct reaction of the 2-aminopyrimidine imine with the isonitrile; 2) condensation of the 2-acetamidopyrimidine imine with the isonitrile followed by removal of the acetamido group; 3) oxidation of the 2-methylthiopyrimidine derivative to the corresponding sulfoxide followed by displacement with the desired amine and 4) assembling the desired alkyl or arylpyrimidine moiety on an intact imidazole by reacting the corresponding substituted guanidine with the desired 5-substituted N,N-dimethylamino-trans-l-propenone imidazole.<br>
While these schemes herein are presented, for instance, with an optionally substituted piperidine moiety for the resultant R2 position, or a 4-fluoro phenyl for R4, any suitable R2 moiety or R4 moiety may be added in this manner if it can be prepared on the primary amine. Similarly, any suitable R4 can be added via the isonitrile route.<br>
For instance, the preparation of 2-aminopyrimidin-4-yl imidazole compounds of Formula (I), when R2 is a 4-substituted cyclohexyl moiety is illustrasted in Scheme X.<br>
Condensation of the appropriate imine and isonitrile is carried out in a typical fashion. Once the relevant moiety is introduced at the 2-position of the pyrimidine ring, the ketone in the cyclohexyl ring can be unmasked and transformed to an alcohol or any other suitable functionality via the corresponding epoxide.<br>

As illustrated in Scheme XI, the 2-aminopyridine containing compounds of formula I can be prepare by displacing the corresponding 2-chloropyridine precursor with the desired amine or its respective anion. Preparation of 2-chloropyridine-4-carboxaldehyde is also illustrated in Scheme XI. Imine formation and cycloaddition<br>
with isonitrile are conducted in the same manner as with the pyrimidine derivatives.<br>

An optimal method of making an isonitrile of Formula (II) is illustrated below, in Scheme XII. (Scheme Removed) <br><br>
SCHEME XII<br>
The conversion of the substituted aldehyde to the tosylbenzyl formamide may be accomplished by heating the aldehyde, 1-Scheme XII, with an acid, such as p-toluene-sulfonic acid, formic acid or camphorsulfonic acid; with formamide and p-toluene-sulfmic acid [under reaction conditions of about 60°C for about 24 hours]. Preferably, no solvent is used. The reaction, may give poor yields (
Another embodiment of the present invention is the synthesis of the tosyl benzyl formamide compound, achieved by reacting the bisformamide intermediate, 2-Scheme XI with p-toluenesulfinic acid. In this preferred route, preparation of the bis-formamide from the aldehyde is accomplished by heating the aldehyde with formamide, in a suitable solvent with acid catalysis. Suitable solvents are toluene, acetonitrile, DMF, and DMSO or mixtures thereof. Acid catalysts, are those well known in the art, and include but are not limited to hydrogen chloride, p-toluenesulfonic acid, camphorsulfonic acid, and other anhydrous acids. The reaction can be conducted at temperatures ranging from about 25°C to 110°C, preferably about 50°C, suitably for about 4 to about 5 hours, longer reaction times are also acceptable. Product decomposition and lower yields may be observed at higher temperatures (&gt;70°C) at prolonged reactions times. Complete conversion of the product generally requires water removal from the reaction mixture.<br>
Preferred conditions for converting a bis-formamide derivative to the tosyl benzyl nide are accomplished by heating the bisformamide in a suitable solvent with an italyst and p-toluenesulfinic acid. Solvents for use in this reaction include but are<br>
not limited to toluene, and acetonitrile or mixtures thereof. Additional mixtures of these solvents with DMF, or DMSO may also be used but may result in lower yields. Temperatures may range from about 30°C to about 100°C. Temperatures lower than 40°C and higher than 60°C are not preferred as the yield and rate decreases. Preferably the range is from about 40 to 60°C, most preferably about 50°C. The optimal time is about 4 to 5 hours, although it may be longer. Preferably, acids used include but are not limited to, toluenesulfonic acid, camphorsulfonic acid, and hydrogen chloride and other anhydrous acids. Most preferably the bisformamide is heated in toluene:acetonitrile in a 1:1 ratio, with p-toluenesulfinic acid and hydrogen chloride.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention is the preferred synthetic route for synthesis of the tosylbenzyl formamide compound which is accomplished using a one-pot procedure. This process first converts the aldehyde to the bis-formamide derivative and subsequently reacts the bis-formamide derivative with toluenesulfinic acid. This procedure combines the optimized conditions into a single, efficient process. High yields, &gt;90% of the aryl benzylformamide may be obtained in such a manner.<br>
Preferred reaction conditions employ a catalyst, such as trimethylsilyl chloride (TMSC1), in a preferred solvent, toluene:acetonitrile, preferably in a 1:1 ratio. A reagent, such as TMSC1, is preferred which reacts with water produced therein and at the same time produces hydrogen chloride to catalyze the reaction. Also preferred is use of hydrogen chloride and p-toluenesulfonic acid. Therefore, three suitable reaction conditions for use herein include 1) use of a dehydrating agent which also provides hydrogen chloride, such as TMSC1; or by 2) use of a suitable dehydrating agent and a suitable source of acid source, such as but not limited to, camphorsulfonic acid, hydrogen chloride or toluenesulfonic acid; and 3) alternative dehydrating conditions, such as the azeotropic removal of water, and using an acid catalyst and p-toluene sulfmic acid.<br>
Compounds of the formula (II) where p is 2 may also be prepared by reacting in the presence of a strong base a compound of the formula (VI) -Scheme I, R4CH2NC with a compound of the formula (Vll)-Scheme I, ArSO2L1 wherein R4 and AT are as defined herein and LI is a leaving group such as halo, e.g. fluoro. Suitable strong bases include, but are not limited to, alkyl lithiums such as butyl lithium or lithium diisopropylamide (Van Leusen et al.. Tetrahedron Letters. No. 23, 2367-68 (1972)).<br>
The compounds of Formula (II), in Scheme I, may be prepared by the methods of van Leusen et al., supra. For example a compound of the Formula (II) may be prepared by dehydrating a compound of the Formula (IV)-Scheme I, wherein AT, R4 and p are as 1 herein.<br>
Suitable dehydrating agents include phosphorus oxychloride, oxalyl chloride, thionyl chloride, phosgene, or tosyl chloride in the presence of a suitable, base such as triethylamine or diisopropylethylamine, or similar bases, etc. such as pyridine. Suitable solvents are dimethoxy ether, tetrahydrofuran, or halogenated solvents, preferably THF. The reaction is most efficent when the reaction temperatures are kept between -10°C and 0°C. At lower temperatures incomplete reaction occurs and at higher temperatures, the solution turns dark and the product yield drops.<br>
The compounds of formula (IV)-Scheme I may be prepared by reacting a compound of the formula (V)-Scheme I, R4CHO where R4 is as defined herein, with ArS(0)pH and formamide with or without water removal, preferably under dehydrating conditions, at ambient or elevated temperature e.g. 30° to 150°, conveniently at reflux, optionally in the presence of an acid catalyst. Alternatively trimethysilylchloride can be used in place of the acid catalyst. Examples of acid catalysts include camphor-10-sulphonic acid, formic acid, p-toluenesulphonic acid, hydrogen chloride or sulphuric acid.<br>
The compounds of formula (Vl)-Scheme I may be prepared by reacting a compound of the formula (VIII)-Scheme I, R4CH2NH2  with an alkyl formate (e.g. ethylformate) to yield an intermediate amide which can be converted to the desired isonitrile by reacting with well known dehydrating agent, such as but not limited to oxalyl chloride, phosphorus oxychloride or tosyl chloride in the presence of a suitable base such as triethylamine.<br>
Alternatively a compound of the formula (VIII) - Scheme I may be converted to a compound of the formula (VI)- Scheme I by reaction with chloroform and sodium hydroxide in aqueous dichloromethane under phase transfer catalysis.<br>
The compounds of the formula (m) - Scheme I may be prepared by reacting a compound of the formula R1CHO with a primary amine R2NH2-<br>
The amino compounds of the formula (VIII) - Scheme I are known or can be prepared from the corresponding alcohols, oximes or amides using standard functional group interconversions.<br>
Suitable protecting groups for use with hydroxyl groups and the imidazole nitrogen are well known in the art and described in many references, for instance, Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis, Greene T W, Wiley-Interscience, New York, 1981. Suitable examples of hydroxyl protecting groups include silyl ethers, such as t-butyldimethyl or t-butyldiphenyl, and alkyl ethers, such as methyl connected by an alkyl chain of variable link, (CR10R20)n- Suitable examples of imidazole nitrogen protecting groups include tetrahydropyranyl.<br>
Pharmaceutically acid addition salts of compounds of Formula (I) may be obtained in known manner, for example by treatment thereof with an appropriate amount of acid in the presence of a suitable solvent.<br>
METHODS OF TREATMENT<br>
The compounds of Formula (I), or Formula (A), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof can be used in the manufacture of a medicament for the prophylactic or therapeutic treatment of any disease state in a human, or other mammal, which is exacerbated or caused by excessive or unregulated cytokine production by such mammal's cell, such as but not limited to monocytes and/or macrophages.<br>
For purposes herein in the Method of Treatment section, compounds of Formula (I) is used interchangeably with compounds of Formula (A). The methods of formulation, dosage forms, disease managment, etc. are the same for both formulas. For instance, "Compounds of Formula (I) are capable..." is also the same as stating :" Compounds of Formula (I) or Formula (A) are capable."<br>
Compounds of Formula (I) are capable of inhibiting proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF and are therefore of use in therapy. IL-1, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF affect a wide variety of cells and tissues and these cytokines, as well as other leukocyte-derived cytokines, are important and critical inflammatory mediators of a wide variety of disease states and conditions. The inhibition of these pro-inflammatory cytokines is of benefit in controlling, reducing and alleviating many of these disease states.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a method of treating a cytokine-mediated disease which comprises administering an effective cytokine-interfering amount of a compound of Formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.<br>
Compounds of Formula (I) are capable of inhibiting inducible proinflammatory proteins, such as COX-2, also referred to by many other names such as prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase-2 (PGHS-2) and are therefore of use in therapy. These proinflammatory lipid mediators of the cyclooxygenase (CO) pathway are produced by the inducible COX-2 enzyme. Regulation, therefore of COX-2 which is responsible for the these products derived from arachidonic acid, such as prostaglandins affect a wide variety of cells and tissues are important and critical inflammatory mediators of a wide variety of disease states and conditions. Expression of COX-1 is not effected by compounds of Formula (I). This selective inhibition of COX-2 may alleviate or spare ulcerogenic liability associated with inhibition of COX-1 thereby inhibiting prostoglandins essential for cytoprotective effects. Thus inhibition of these pro-matory mediators is of benefit in controlling, reducing and alleviating many of disease states. Most notably these inflammatory mediators, in particular<br>
prostaglandins, have been implicated in pain, such as in the sensitization of pain receptors, or edema. This aspect of pain management therefore includes treatment of neuromuscular pain, headache, cancer pain, and arthritis pain. Compounds of Formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, are of use in the prophylaxis or therapy in a human, or other mammal, by inhibition of the synthesis of the COX-2 enzyme.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a method of inhibiting the synthesis of COX-2 which comprises administering an effective amount of a compound of Formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. The present invention also provides for a method of prophylaxis treatment in a human, or other mammal, by inhibition of the synthesis of the COX-2 enzyme.<br>
A new member of the MAP kinase family, alternatively termed CSBP, p38, or RK, has been identified independently by several laboratories recently. Activation of this novel protein kinase via dual phosphorylation has been observed in different cell systems upon stimulation by a wide spectrum of stimuli, such as physicochemical stress and treatment with lipopolysaccharide or proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor. The cytokine biosynthesis inhibitors, of the present invention, compounds of Formula (I), have been determined to be potent and selective inhibitors of CSBP/p38/RK kinase activity. These inhibitors are of aid in determining the signaling pathways involvement in inflammatory responses. In particular, for the first time a definitive signal transduction pathway can be prescribed to the action of lipopolysaccharide in cytokine production in macrophages.<br>
The cytokine inhibitors were subsequently tested in a number of animal models for anti-inflammatory activity. Model systems were chosen that were relatively insensitive to cyclooxygenase inhibitors in order to reveal the unique activities of cytokine suppressive agents. The inhibitors exhibited significant activity in many such in vivo studies. Most notable are its effectiveness in the collagen-induced arthritis model and inhibition of TNF production in the endotoxic shock model. In the latter study, the reduction in plasma level of TNF correlated with survival and protection from endotoxic shock related mortality. Also of great importance are the compounds effectiveness in inhibiting bone resorption in a rat fetal long bone organ culture system. Griswold et al., (1988) Arthritis Rheum. 31:1406-1412; Badger, et al., (1989) Circ. Shock 27,51-61; Votta et al., (1994) in vitro. Bone 15,533-538; Lee et al., (1993). B Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 696, 149-170.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention, therefore, is the treatement of a CSBP/RK/p38 kinase mediated disease, in a mammal in need thereof, which comprises administering to said mammal an effective amount of a compound of Formula (I). Suitable diseases, include those mentioned herein for IL-1, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF and more specifically those disease which are CSBP/RK/p38 kinase mediated diseases. These<br>
include, but are not limtied to rheumatoid arthritis, rheumatoid spondylitis, osteoarthritis, gouty arthritis and other arthritic conditions, sepsis, septic shock, endotoxic shock, gram negative sepsis, toxic shock syndrome, asthma, adult respiratory distress syndrome, stroke, reperfusion injury, CNS injuries, such as neurotruama and ischemia, including both open and closed head injuries), psoriasis, restenosis, such as occurs following coronary angioplasty, cerebral malaria, chronic pulmonary inflammatory disease, silicosis, pulmonary sarcososis, bone resorption diseases, osteoporosis,, graft vs. host reaction, allograft rejections, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis or any other anti-inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), or pyresis.<br>
CNS injuries as defined herein include both open or penetrating head trauma, such as by surgery, or a closed head trauma injury, such as by an injury to the head region.   Also included within this definition is ischemic stroke, particularly to the brain area.<br>
Ischemic stroke may be defined as a focal neurologic disorder that results from insufficient blood supply to a particular brain area, usually as a consequence of an embolus, thrombi, or local atheromatous closure of the blood vessel. The role of inflammatory cytokines in this are has been emerging and the present invention provides a mean for the potential treatment of these injuries. Relatively little treatment, for an acute injury such as these has been available.<br>
TNF-a is a cytokine with proinflammatory actions, including endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule expression. Leukocytes infiltrate into ischemic brain lesions and hence compounds which inhibit or decrease levels of TNF would be useful for treatment of ischemic brain injury. See Liu et al., Stoke, Vol. 25., No. 7, pp 1481-88 (1994) whose disclosure is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Models of closed head injuries and treatment with mixed 5-LO/CO agents is discussed in Shohami et al., J. of Vaisc &amp; Clinical Physiology and Pharmacology, Vol. 3, No. 2, pp. 99-107 (1992) whose disclosure is incorporated herein by reference. Treatment which reduced edema formation was found to improve functional outcome in those animals treated.<br>
In particular, compounds of Formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof are of use in the prophylaxis or therapy of any disease state in a human, or other mammal, which is exacerbated by or caused by excessive or unregulated DL-1, IL-8 or TNF production by such mammal's cell, such as, but not limited to, monocytes and/or macrophages.<br>
Accordingly, in another aspect, this invention relates to a method of inhibiting the production of IL-1 in a mammal in need thereof which comprises administering to said<br>
mammal an effective amount of a compound of Formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.<br>
There are many disease states in which excessive or unregulated IL-1 production is implicated in exacerbating and/or causing the disease'. These include rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, stroke, endotoxemia and/or toxic shock syndrome, other acute or chronic inflammatory disease states such as the inflammatory reaction induced by endotoxin or inflammatory bowel disease, tuberculosis, atherosclerosis, muscle degeneration, multiple sclerosis, cachexia, bone resorption, psoriatic arthritis, Reiter's syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, traumatic arthritis, rubella arthritis and acute synovitis. Recent evidence also links IL-1 activity to diabetes, pancreatic 6 cells and Alzheimer's disease.<br>
In a further aspect, this invention relates to a method of inhibiting the production of TNF in a mammal in need thereof which comprises administering to said mammal an effective amount of a compound of Formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.<br>
Excessive or unregulated TNF production has been implicated in mediating or exacerbating a number of diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, rheumatoid spondylitis, osteoarthritis, gouty arthritis and other arthritic conditions, sepsis, septic shock, endotoxic shock, gram negative sepsis, toxic shock syndrome, adult respiratory distress syndrome, stroke, cerebral malaria, chronic pulmonary inflammatory disease, silicosis, pulmonary sarcoisosis, bone resorption diseases, such as osteoporosis, reperfusion injury, graft vs. host reaction, allograft rejections, fever and myalgias due to infection, such as influenza, cachexia secondary to infection or malignancy, cachexia secondary to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), AIDS, ARC (AIDS related complex), keloid formation, scar tissue formation, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and pyresis.<br>
Compounds of Formula (I) are also useful in the treatment of viral infections, where such viruses are sensitive to upregulation by TNF or will elicit TNF production in vivo. The viruses contemplated for treatment herein are those that produce TNF as a result of infection, or those which are sensitive to inhibition, such as by decreased replication, directly or indirectly, by the TNF inhibiting-compounds of Formula (1). Such viruses include, but are not limited to HIV-1, HIV-2 and HIV-3, Cytomegalovirus (CMV), Influenza, adenovirus and the Herpes group of viruses, such as but not limited to, Herpes Zoster and Herpes Simplex. Accordingly, in a further aspect, this invention relates to a method of treating a mammal afflicted with a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) which comprises administering to such mammal an effective TNF inhibiting amount of a compound of Formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.<br>
Compounds of Formula (I) may also be used in association with the veterinary treatment of mammals, other than in humans, in need of inhibition of TNF production. TNF mediated diseases for treatment, therapeutically or prophylactically, in animals include disease states such as those noted above, but in particular viral infections. Examples of such viruses include, but are not limited to, lentivirus infections such as, equine infectious anaemia virus, caprine arthritis virus, visna virus, or maedi virus or retrovirus infections, such as but not limited to feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), bovine immunodeficiency virus, or canine immunodeficiency virus or other retroviral infections.<br>
The compounds of Formula (I) may also be used topically in the treatment or prophylaxis of topical disease states mediated by or exacerbated by excessive cytokine production, such as by IL-1 or TNF respectively, such as inflamed joints, eczema, psoriasis and other inflammatory skin conditions such as sunburn; inflammatory eye conditions including conjunctivitis; pyresis, pain and other conditions associated with inflammation.<br>
Compounds of Formula (I) have also been shown to inhibit the production of EL-8 (Interleukin-8, NAP). Accordingly, in a further aspect, this invention relates to a method of inhibiting the production of IL-8 in a mammal in need thereof which comprises administering to said mammal an effective amount of a compound of Formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.<br>
There are many disease states in which excessive or unregulated IL-8 production is implicated in exacerbating and/or causing the disease. These diseases are characterized by massive neutrophil infiltration such as, psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease, asthma, cardiac and renal reperfusion injury, adult respiratory distress syndrome, thrombosis and glomerulonephritis. Ail of these diseases are associated with increased IL-8 production which is responsible for the chemotaxis of neutrophils into the inflammatory site. In-contrast to other inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, TNF, and IL-6), EL-8 has the unique property of promoting neutrophil chemotaxis and activation. Therefore, the inhibition of IL-8 production would lead to a direct reduction in the neutrophil infiltration.<br>
The compounds of Formula (I) are administered in an amount sufficient to inhibit cytokine, in particular IL-1, IL-6, IL-8 or TNF, production such that it is regulated down to normal levels, or in some case to subnormal levels, so as to ameliorate or prevent the disease state. Abnormal levels of IL-1, IL-6, IL-8 or TNF, for instance in the context of the present invention, constitute: (i) levels of free (not cell bound) BL-1, EL-6, IL-8 or TNF greater than or equal to 1 picogram per ml; (ii) any cell associated IL-1, BL-6, EL-8 or TNF; or (iii) the presence of IL-1, IL-6, EL-8 or TNF mRNA above basal levels in cells or tissues in which EL-1, EL-6, EL-8 or TNF, respectively, is produced.<br>
The discovery that the compounds of Formula (I) are inhibitors of cytokines, specifically EL-1, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF is based upon the effects of the compounds of Formulas (I) on the production of the IL-1, IL-8 and TNF in in vitro assays which are described herein.<br>
As used herein, the term "inhibiting the production of IL-1 (IL-6, IL-8 or TNF)" refers to:<br>
a)	a decrease of excessive in vivo levels of the cytokine (IL-1, IL-6, IL-8 or<br>
TNF) in a human to normal or sub-normal levels by inhibition of the in vivo release of<br>
the cytokine by all cells, including but not limited to monocytes or macrophages;<br>
b)	a down regulation, at the genomic level, of excessive in vivo levels of the<br>
cytokine (IL-l, IL-6, IL-8 or TNF) in a human to normal or sub-normal levels;<br>
c)	a down regulation, by inhibition of the direct synthesis of the cytokine (IL-1,<br>
IL-6, IL-8 or TNF) as a postranslational event; or<br>
d)	a down regulation, at the translational level, of excessive in vivo levels of the<br>
cytokine (IL-1, IL-6, IL-8 or TNF) in a human to normal or sub-normal levels.<br>
As used herein, the term "TNF mediated disease or disease state" refers to any and all disease states in which TNF plays a role, either by production of TNF itself, or by TNF causing another monokine to be released, such as but not limited to IL-1, IL-6 or EL-8. A disease state in which, for instance, IL-1 is a major component, and whose production or action, is exacerbated or secreted in response to TNF, would therefore be considered a disease stated mediated by TNF.<br>
As used herein, the term "cytokine" refers to any secreted polypeptide that affects the functions of cells and is a molecule which modulates interactions between cells in the immune, inflammatory or hematopoietic response. A cytokine includes, but is not limited to, monokines and lymphokines, regardless of which cells produce them. For instance, a monokine is generally referred to as being produced and secreted by a mononuclear cell, such as a macrophage and/or monocyte. Many other cells however also produce monokines, such as natural killer cells, fibroblasts, basophils, neutrophils, endothelial cells, brain astrocytes, bone marrow stromal cells, epideral keratinocytes and B-lymphocytes. Lymphokines are generally referred to as being produced by lymphocyte cells. Examples of cytokines include, but are not limited to, Interleukin-1 (IL-1), Interleukin-6 (IL-6), Interleukin-8 (IL-8), Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α) and Tumor Necrosis Factor beta (TNF-ß).<br>
As used herein, the term "cytokine interfering" or "cytokine suppressive amount" refers to an effective amount of a compound of Formula (I) which will cause a decrease in the in vivo levels of the cytokine to normal or sub-normal levels, when given to a<br>
patient for the prophylaxis or treatment of a disease state which is exacerbated by, or caused by, excessive or unregulated cytokine production.<br>
As used herein, the cytokine referred to in the phrase "inhibition of a cytokine, for use in the treatment of a HIV-infected human" is a cytokine which is implicated in (a) the initiation and/or maintenance of T cell activation and/or activated T cell-mediated HIV gene expression and/or replication and/or (b) any cytokine-mediated disease associated problem such as cachexia or muscle degeneration.<br>
As TNF-S (also known as lymphotoxin) has close structural homology with TNF-cc (also known as cachectin) and since each induces similar biologic responses and binds to the same cellular receptor, both TNF-a and TNF-B are inhibited by the compounds of the present invention and thus are herein referred to collectively as "TNF" unless specifically delineated otherwise.<br>
In order to use a compound of Formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof in therapy, it will normally be Formulated into a pharmaceutical composition in accordance with standard pharmaceutical practice. This invention, therefore, also relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising an effective, non-toxic amount of a compound of Formula (I) and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent.<br>
Compounds of Formula (I), pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof and pharmaceutical compositions incorporating such may conveniently be administered by any of the routes conventionally used for drug administration, for instance, orally, topically, parenterally or by inhalation. The compounds of Formula (I) may be administered in conventional dosage forms prepared by combining a compound of Formula (I) with standard pharmaceutical carriers according to conventional procedures. The compounds of Formula (I) may also be administered in conventional dosages in combination with a known, second therapeutically active compound. These procedures may involve mixing, granulating and compressing or dissolving the ingredients as appropriate to the desired preparation. It will be appreciated that the form and character of the pharmaceutically acceptable character or diluent is dictated by the amount of active ingredient with which it is to be combined, the route of administration and other well-known variables. The carrier(s) must be "acceptable" in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the Formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof.<br>
The pharmaceutical carrier employed may be, for example, either a solid or liquid. Exemplary of solid carriers are lactose, terra alba, sucrose, talc, gelatin, agar, pectin, acacia, magnesium stearate, stearic acid and the like. Exemplary of liquid carriers are syrup, peanut oil, olive oil, water and the like. Similarly, the carrier or<br>
diluent may include time delay material well known to the art, such as glyceryl mono-stearate or glyceryl distearate alone or with a wax.<br>
A wide variety of pharmaceutical forms can be employed. Thus, if a solid carrier is used, the preparation can be tableted, placed in a hard gelatin capsule in powder or pellet form or in the form of a troche or lozenge. The amount of solid carrier will vary widely but preferably will be from about 25mg. to about Ig. When a liquid carrier is used, the preparation will be in the form of a syrup, emulsion, soft gelatin capsule, sterile injectable liquid such as an ampule or nonaqueous liquid suspension.<br>
Compounds of Formula (I) may be administered topically, that is by non-systemic administration. This includes the application of a compound of Formula (I) externally to the epidermis or the buccal cavity and the instillation of such a compound into the ear, eye and nose, such that the compound does not significantly enter the blood stream. In contrast, systemic administration refers to oral, intravenous, intraperitoneal and intramuscular administration.<br>
Formulations suitable for topical administration include liquid or semi-liquid preparations suitable for penetration through the skin to the site of inflammation such as liniments, lotions, creams, ointments or pastes, and drops suitable for administration to the eye, ear or nose. The active ingredient may comprise, for topical administration, from 0.001% to 10% w/w, for instance from 1% to 2% by weight of the Formulation. It may however comprise as much as 10% w/w but preferably will comprise less than 5% w/w, more preferably from 0.1% to 1% w/w of the Formulation.<br>
Lotions according to the present invention include those suitable for application to the skin or eye. An eye lotion may comprise a sterile aqueous solution optionally containing a bactericide and may be prepared by methods similar to those for the preparation of drops. Lotions or liniments for application to the skin may also include an agent to hasten drying and to cool the skin, such as an alcohol or acetone, and/or a moisturizer such as glycerol or an oil such as castor oil or arachis oil.<br>
Creams, ointments or pastes according to the present invention are semi-solid formulations of the active ingredient for external application. They may be made by mixing the active ingredient in finely-divided or powdered form, alone or in solution or suspension in an aqueous or non-aqueous fluid, with the aid of suitable machinery, with a greasy or non-greasy base. The base may comprise hydrocarbons such as hard, soft or liquid paraffin, glycerol, beeswax, a metallic soap; a mucilage; an oil of natural origin such as almond, corn, arachis, castor or olive oil; wool fat or its derivatives or a fatty acid such as steric or oleic acid together with an alcohol such as propylene glycol or a macrogel. The formulation may incorporate any suitable surface active agent such as an anionic, cationic or non-ionic surfactant such as a sorbitan ester or a polyoxyethylene derivative thereof. Suspending agents such as natural gums, cellulose derivatives or<br><br>
inorganic materials such as silicaceous silicas, and other ingredients such as lanolin, may also be included.<br>
Drops according to the present invention may comprise sterile aqueous or oily solutions or suspensions and may be prepared by dissolving the active ingredient in a suitable aqueous solution of a bactericidal and/or fungicidal agent and/or any other suitable preservative, and preferably including a surface active agent. The resulting solution may then be clarified by filtration, transferred to a suitable container which is then sealed and sterilized by autoclaving or'maintaining at 98-100° C. for half an hour. Alternatively, the solution may be sterilized by filtration and transferred to the container by an aseptic technique. Examples of bactericidal and fungicidal agents suitable for inclusion in the drops are phenylmercuric nitrate or acetate (0.002%), benzalkonium chloride (0.01%) and chlorhexidine acetate (0.01%). Suitable solvents for the preparation of an oily solution include glycerol, diluted alcohol and propylene glycol.<br>
Compounds of formula (I) may be administered parenterally, that is by intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous intranasal, intrarectal, intravaginal or intraperitoneal administration. The subcutaneous and intramuscular forms of parenteral administration are generally preferred. Appropriate dosage forms for such administration may be prepared by conventional techniques. Compounds of Formula (I) may also be administered by inhalation, that is by intranasal and oral inhalation administration. Appropriate dosage forms for such administration, such as an aerosol formulation or a metered dose inhaler, may be prepared by conventional techniques.<br>
For all methods of use disclosed herein for the compounds of Formula (I), the daily oral dosage regimen will preferably be from about 0.01 to about 80 mg/kg of total body weight, preferably from about 0.1 to 30 mg/kg, more preferably from about 0.2 mg to ISmg. The daily parenteral dosage regimen about 0.01 to about 80 mg/kg of total body weight, preferably from about 0.1 to about 30 mg/kg, and more preferably from about 0.2 mg to 15mg/kg. The daily topical dosage regimen will preferably be from 0.1 mg to 150 mg, administered one to four, preferably two or three times daily. The daily inhalation dosage regimen will preferably be from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 1 mg/kg per day. It will also be recognized by one of skill in the art that the optimal quantity and spacing of individual dosages of a compound of Formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof will be determined by the nature and extent of the condition being treated, the form, route and site of administration, and the particular patient being treated, and that such optimums can be determined by conventional techniques. It will also be appreciated by one of skill in the art that the optimal course of treatment, i.e., the number of doses of a compound of Formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof given per day for a defined number of days, can be ascertained by those skilled in the art using conventional course of treatment determination tests.<br>
The novel compounds of Formula (I) may also be used in association with the veterinary treatment of mammals, other than humans, in need of inhibition of cytokine inhibition or production. In particular, cytokine mediated diseases for treatment, therapeutically or prophylactically, in animals include disease states such as those noted herein in the Methods of Treatment section, but in particular viral infections. Examples of such viruses include, but are not limited to, lentivirus infections such as, equine infectious anaemia virus, caprine arthritis virus, visna virus, or maedi virus or retrovirus infections, such as but not limited to feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), bovine immunodeficiency virus, or canine immunodeficiency virus or other retroviral infections.<br>
The invention will now be described by reference to the following biological examples which are merely illustrative and are not to be construed as a limitation of the scope of the present invention.<br>
BIOLOGICAL EXAMPLES<br>
The cytokine-inhibiting effects of compounds of the present invention were determined by the following in vitro assays: Interleukin -1 (IL-1)<br>
Human peripheral blood monocytes are isolated and purified from either fresh blood preparations from volunteer donors, or from blood bank buffy coats, according to the procedure of Colotta et al, J Immunol, 132,936 (1984). These monocytes (1xl06) are plated in 24-well plates at a concentration of 1-2 million/ml per well. The cells are allowed to adhere for 2 hours, after which time non-adherent cells are removed by gentle washing. Test compounds are then added to the cells for Ih before the addition of lipopolysaccharide (50 ng/ml), and the cultures are incubated at 37°C for an additional 24h. At the end of this period, culture supematants are removed and clarified of cells and all debris. Culture supematants are then immediately assayed for IL-1 biological activity, either by the method of Simon et al., J. Immunol. Methods, 84, 85, (1985) (based on ability of IL-1 to stimulate a Interleukin 2 producing cell line (EL-4) to secrete IL-2, in concert with A23187 ionophore) or the method of Lee et al., J. ImmunoTherapy, 6(1), 1-12 (1990) (ELISA assay).<br>
Tumour Necrosis Factor (TNF):<br>
Human peripheral blood monocytes are isolated and purified from either blood bank buffy coats or plateletpheresis residues, according to the procedure of Colotta, R. et al., J Immunol, 132(2), 936 (1984). The monocytes are plated at a density of 1xl06 cells/ml medium/well in 24-well multi-dishes. The cells are allowed to adhere for 1 hour after which time the supernatant is aspirated and fresh medium (1ml, RPMI-1640, Whitaker Biomedical Products, Whitaker, CA) containing 1% fetal calf serum plus<br>
penicillin and streptomycin (10 units/ml) added. The cells are incubated for 45 minutes in the presence or absence of a test compound at InM- l0mM dose ranges (compounds are solubilized in dimethyl sulfoxide/ethanol, such that the final solvent concentration in the culture medium is 0.5% dimethyl sulfoxide/0.5% ethanol). Bacterial lipopoly-saccharide (E. coli 055:B5 [LPS] from Sigma Chemicals Co.) is then-added (100 ng/ml in 10 ml phosphate buffered saline) and cultures incubated for 16-18 hours at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator. At the end of the incubation period, culture supernatams are removed from the cells, centrifuged at 3000 rpm to remove cell debris. The supernatant is then assayed for TNF activity using either a radio-immuno or an ELISA assay, as described in WO 92/10190 and by Becker et al., J Immunol, 1991,147, 4307.<br>
IL-1 and TNF inhibitory activity does not seem to correlate with the property of the compounds of Formula (I) in mediating arachidonic acid metabolism inhibition. Further the ability to inhibit production of prostaglandin and/or leukotriene synthesis, by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs with potent cyclooxygenase and/or lipoxygenase inhibitory activity does not mean that the compound will necessarily also inhibit TNF or IL-1 production, at non-toxic doses.<br>
Interleukin -8 (IL-8):<br>
Primary human umbilical cord endothelial cells (HUVEC) (Cell Systems, Kirland, Wa) are maintained in culture medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum and 1% CS-HBGF consisting of aFGF and heparin. The cells are then diluted 20-fold before being plated (250µl) into gelating coated 96-well plates. Prior to use, culture medium are replaced with fresh medium (200µl). Buffer or test compound (25µl, at concentrations between 1 and l0µM) is then added to each well in quadruplicate wells and the plates incubated for 6h in a humidified incubator at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2- At the end of the incubation period, supernatant is removed and assayed for IL-8 concentration using an IL-8 ELISA kit obtained from R&amp;D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). All data is presented as mean value (ng/ml) of multiple samples based on the standard curve. IC50's where appropriate are generated by non-linear regression analysis.<br>
Cytokine Specific Binding Protein Assay<br>
A radiocompetitive binding assay was developed to provide a highly reproducible primary screen for structure-activity studies. This assay provides many advantages over the conventional bioassays which utilize freshly isolated human monocytes as a source of cytokines and ELISA assays to quantify them. Besides being a much more facile assay, the binding assay has been extensively validated to highly correlate with the results of the bioassay. A specific and reproducible cytokine inhibitor binding assay was developed<br>
using soluble cystosolic fraction from THP. 1 cells and a radiolabeled compound. Patent Application USSN 08/123175 Lee et al., filed September 1993, USSN; Lee et al., PCT 94/10529 filed 16 September 1994 and Lee et al., Nature 300, n(72), 739-746 (Dec. 1994) whose disclosures are incorporated by reference herein in its entirety describes the above noted method for screening drugs to identify compounds which interact with and bind to the cytokine specific binding protein (hereinafter CSBP). However, for purposes herein the binding protein may be in isolated form in solution, or in immobilized form, or may be genetically engineered to be expressed on the surface of recombinant host cells such as in phage display system or as fusion proteins. Alternatively, whole cells or cytosolic fractions comprising the CSBP may be employed in the screening protocol. Regardless of the form of the binding protein, a plurality of compounds are contacted with the binding protein under conditions sufficient to form a compound/ binding protein complex and compound capable of forming, enhancing or interfering with said complexes are detected.<br>
Representative compounds of Formula (I), Examples 2 to 28, have all demonstrated positive inhibitory activity in this binding assay.<br>
Prostoglandin endoperoxide synthase-2 (PGHS-2) assay:<br>
The following assay describes a method for determining the inhibitory effects of compounds of Formula (I) on human PGHS-2 protein expression in LPS stimulated human monocytes.<br>
Method:   Human peripheal blood monocytes were isolated from buffy coats by centrifugation through Ficoll and Percoll gradients. Cells were seeded at 2 X 106/well in 24 well plates and allowed to adhere for 1 hour in RPMI supplemented with 1% human AB serum, 20mM L-glutamine, Penicillin-Streptomycin and lOrnM HEPES. Compounds were added at various concentrations and incubated at 37°C for 10 minutes. LPS was added at 50 ng/well (to induce enzyme expression) and incubated overnight at 37°C. The supernatant was removed and cells washed once in cold PBS. The cells were lysed in l00µl of cold lysis buffer(50mM Tris/HCl pH 7.5, 150mM NaCl, 1% NP40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 300ug/ml DNAse, 0.1% TRITON X-100, ImM PMSF, ImM leupeptin, ImM pepstatin). The lysate was centrifuged (10,000 X g for 10 min. at 4°C) to remove debris and the soluble fraction was subjected to SDS PAGE. analysis (12% gel). Protein separated on the gel were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane by electrophoretic means for 2 hours at 60 volts. The membrane was pretreated for one hour in PBS/0.1% Tween 20 with 5% non-fat dry milk. After washing 3 times in PBS/Tween buffer, the membrane was incubated with a 1:2000 dilution of a monospecific antiserum to PGHS-2 or a 1:1000 dilution of an antiserum to PGHs-1 in PBS/Tween with 1% BSA for one hour with continuous shaking. The<br>
membrane was washed 3X in PBS/Tween and then incubated with a 1:3000 dilution of<br>
horseradish peroxidase conjugated donkey antiserum to rabbit Ig (Amersham) in<br>
PBS/Tween with 1% BSA for one hour with continuous shaking. The membrane was<br>
then washed 3X in PBS/Tween and the ECL immunodetection system (Amersham) was<br>
used to detect the level of expression of prostaglandin endoperoxide synthases-2.<br>
Results:	The following compounds were tested and found to be active in this assay<br>
(i.e., inhibited LPS induced PGHS-2 protein expression in rank order potency similar to that for inhibiting cytokine production as noted in assays indicated): 6-(4-Fluoro-phenyl)-2,3-dihydro-5-(4-pyridinyl)imidazo[2,l-b]thiazole; and Dexamethasone<br>
Several compounds were tested and found to be inactive (up to l0µM): 2-(4-Methylsulfmylphenyl)-3-(4-pyridyl)-6,7-dihydro-(5H)-pyrrolo[l,2-a]imidazole; rolipram ; phenidone and NDGA.   None of these compounds tested were found to inhibit PGHS-1 or cPLA2 protein levels in similar experiments.<br>
TNF-ot in Traumatic Brain Injury Assay<br>
The present assay provides for examination of the expression of tumor necrosis faxtor mRNA in specfic brain regions which follow experimentally induced lateral fluid-percussion traumatic brain injury (TBI) in rats. Adult Sprague-Dawley rats (n=42) are anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (60 mg/kg, i.p.) and subjected to lateral fluid-percussion brain injury of moderate severity (2.4 atm.) centered over the left temporaparietal cortex (n=18), or "sham" treatment (anesthesia and surgery without injury, n=18). Animals are sacrificed by decapitation at 1, 6 and 24 hr. post injury, brains removed, and tissue samples of left (injured) parietal cortex (LC), corresponding area in the contralateral right cortex (RC), cortex adjacent to injured parietal cortex (LA), corresponding adjacent area in the right cortex (RA), left hippocampus (LH) and right hippocampus (RH) are prepared. Total RNA is isolated and Northern blot hybridization is performed and quantitated relative to an TNF-a positive control RNA (macrophage = 100%). A marked increase of TNF-a mRNA expression is observed in LH (104±17% of positive control, p 
expression of TNF-α mRNA is altered in specific brain regions, including those of the non-traumatized hemisphere. Since TNF-a is able to induce nerve growth factor (NGF) and stimulate the release of other cytokines from activated astrocytes, this post-traumatic alteration in gene expression of TNF-a plays an important role in both the acute and regenerative response to CNS trauma.<br>
CNS Injury model for IL-ß mRNA<br>
This assay characterizes the regional expression of interleukin-1B (EL-IB) mRNA in specific brain regions following experimental lateral fluid-percussion traumatic brain injury (TBI) in rats. Adult Sprague-Dawley rats (n=42) are anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (60 mg/kg, i.p.) and subjected to lateral fluid-percussion brain injury of moderate severity (2.4 atm.) centered over the left temporaparietal cortex (n=18), or "sham" treatment (anesthesia and surgery without injury). Animals are sacrificed at 1, 6 and 24 hr. post injury, brains removed, and tissue samples of left (injured) parietal cortex (LC), corresponding area in the contralateral right cortex (RC), cortex adjacent to injured parietal cortex (LA), corresponding adjacent area in the right cortex (RA), left hippocampus (LH) and right hippocampus (RH) were prepared. Total RNA is isolated and Northern blot hybridization is performed and the quantity of brain tissue IL-1B mRNA is presented as percent relative radioactivity of EL-IB positive macrophage RNA which is loaded on same gel. At 1 hr. following brain injury, a marked and significant increase in expression of EL-IB mRNA is observed in LC (20.0±0.7% of positive control, n=6, p
