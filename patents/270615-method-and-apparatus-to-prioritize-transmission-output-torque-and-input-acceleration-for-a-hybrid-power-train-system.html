				<td>METHOD AND APPARATUS TO PRIORITIZE TRANSMISSION<br>
OUTPUT TORQUE AND INPUT ACCELERATION FOR A HYBRID<br>
POWERTRAIN SYSTEM<br>
CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application<br>
No. 60/985,281 filed on November 4, 2007 which is hereby incorporated<br>
herein by reference.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0002] This disclosure pertains to control systems for electro-mechanical<br>
transmissions.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
[0004] Known powertrain architectures include torque-generative devices,<br>
including internal combustion engines and electric machines, which transmit<br>
torque through a transmission device to an output member. One exemplary<br>
powertrain includes a two-mode, compound-split, electro-mechanical<br>
transmission which utilizes an input member for receiving motive torque from<br>
a prime mover power source, preferably an internal combustion engine, and an<br>
output member. The output member can be operatively connected to a<br>
driveline for a motor vehicle for transmitting tractive torque thereto. Electric<br><br><br>
machines, operative as motors or generators, generate an input torque to the<br>
transmission, independently of an input torque from the internal combustion<br>
engine. The electric machines may transform vehicle kinetic energy,<br>
transmitted through the vehicle driveline, to electrical energy that is storable in<br>
an electrical energy storage device. A control system monitors various inputs<br>
from the vehicle and the operator and provides operational control of the<br>
powertrain, including controlling transmission operating range state and gear<br>
shifting, controlling the torque-generative devices, and regulating the electrical<br>
power interchange among the electrical energy storage device and the electric<br>
machines to manage outputs of the transmission, including torque and<br>
rotational speed.<br>
[0005] Transmissions within a hybrid powertrain, as described above, serve<br>
a number of functions by transmitting and manipulating torque in order to<br>
provide torque to an output member. In order to serve the particular function<br>
required, the transmission selects between a number of operating range states<br>
or configurations internal to the transmission defining the transfer of torque<br>
through the transmission. Known transmissions utilize operating range states<br>
including fixed gear states or states with a defined gear ratio. For example, a<br>
transmission can utilize four sequentially arranged fixed gear states and allow<br>
selection between the four gear states in order to provide output torque<br>
through a wide range of output member speeds. Additively or alternatively,<br>
known transmissions also allow for continuously variable operating range<br>
states or mode states, enabled for instance through the use of a planetary gear<br>
set, wherein the gear ratio provided by the transmission can be varied across a<br>
range in order to modulate the output speed and output torque provided by a<br><br><br>
particular set of inputs. Additionally, transmissions can operate in a neutral<br>
state, ceasing all torque from being transmitted through the transmission.<br>
Additionally, transmissions can operate in a reverse mode, accepting input<br>
torque in a particular rotational direction used for normal forward operation<br>
and reversing the direction of rotation of the output member. Through<br>
selection of different operating range states, transmissions can provide a range<br>
of outputs for a given input.<br>
[0006] Operation of the above devices within a hybrid powertrain vehicle<br>
require management of numerous torque bearing shafts or devices<br>
representing connections to the above mentioned engine, electrical machines.<br>
and driveline. Input torque from the engine and input torque from the electric<br>
machine or electric machines can be applied individually or cooperatively to<br>
provide output torque. However, changes in output torque required from the<br>
transmission, for instance, due to a change in operator pedal position or due to<br>
an operating range state shift, must be handled smoothly. Particularly difficult<br>
to manage are input torques, applied simultaneously to a transmission, with<br>
different reaction times to a control input. Based upon a single control input,<br>
the various devices can change respective input torques at different times,<br>
causing increased abrupt changes to the overall torque applied through the<br>
transmission. Abrupt or uncoordinated changes to the various input torques<br>
applied to a transmission can cause a perceptible change in acceleration or jerk<br>
in the vehicle, which can adversely affect vehicle drivability.<br>
[0007] Various control schemes and operational connections between the<br>
various aforementioned components of the hybrid drive system are known,<br>
and the control system must be able to engage to and disengage the various<br><br><br>
components from the transmission in order to perform the functions of the<br>
hybrid powertrain system. Engagement and disengagement are known to be<br>
accomplished within the transmission by employing selectively operable<br>
clutches. Clutches are devices well known in the art for engaging and<br>
disengaging shafts including the management of rotational velocity and torque<br>
differences between the shafts. Engagement or locking, disengagement or<br>
unlocking, operation while engaged or locked operation, and operation while<br>
disengaged or unlocked operation are all clutch states that must be managed in<br>
order for the vehicle to operate properly and smoothly.<br>
[0008] Clutches are known in a variety of designs and control methods. One<br>
known type of clutch is a mechanical clutch operating by separating or joining<br>
two connective surfaces, for instance, clutch plates, operating, when joined, to<br>
apply frictional torque to each other. One control method for operating such a<br>
mechanical clutch includes applying a hydraulic control system implementing<br>
fluidic pressures transmitted through hydraulic lines to exert or release<br>
clamping force between the two connective surfaces. Operated thusly, the<br>
clutch is not operated in a binary manner, but rather is capable of a range of<br>
engagement states, from fully disengaged, to synchronized but not engaged, to<br>
engaged but with only minimal clamping force, to engaged with some<br>
maximum clamping force. Clamping force applied to the clutch determines<br>
how much reactive torque the clutch can carry before the clutch slips.<br>
Variable control of clutches through modulation of clamping force allows for<br>
transition between locked and unlocked states and further allows for managing<br>
slip in a locked transmission. In addition, the maximum clamping force<br><br>
capable of being applied by the hydraulic lines can also vary with vehicle<br>
operating states and can be modulated based upon control strategies.<br>
[0009] Clutches are known to be operated asynchronously, designed to<br>
accommodate some level of slip in transitions between locked and unlocked<br>
states. Other clutches are known to be operated synchronously, designed to<br>
match speeds of connective surfaces or synchronize before the connective<br>
surfaces are clamped together. This disclosure deals primarily with<br>
synchronous clutches.<br>
[0010] Slip, or relative rotational movement between the connective surfaces<br>
of the clutch when the clutch connective surfaces are intended to be<br>
synchronized and locked, occurs whenever reactive torque applied to the<br>
clutch exceeds actual torque capacity created by applied clamping force. Slip<br>
in a transmission results in unintended loss of torque control within the<br>
transmission, results in loss of engine speed control and electric machine<br>
speed control caused by a sudden change in back-torque from the<br>
transmission, and results in sudden changes to vehicle acceleration, creating<br>
adverse affects to drivability.<br>
[0011] Transmissions can operate with a single clutch transmitting reactive<br>
torque between inputs and an output. Transmission can operate with a<br>
plurality of clutches transmitting reactive torque between inputs and an output.<br>
Selection of operating range state depends upon the selective engagement of<br>
clutches, with different allowable combinations resulting in different operating<br>
range states.<br>
[0012] Output torque and control of input speed through input acceleration<br>
are important properties of powertrain operation. In instances where these<br><br><br>
properties conflict, a method to balance or prioritize control of the powertrain<br>
between these properties, in particular depending upon a condition of stable or<br>
transient powertrain operation, would be beneficial.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0013] A powertrain includes an electro-mechanical transmission<br>
mechanically-operatively coupled to an internal combustion engine and an<br>
electric machine adapted to selectively transmit mechanical power to an output<br>
member. A method for controlling the powertrain includes operating the<br>
transmission in an operating range state wherein input speed can operate<br>
independent of output speed and wherein a reactive torque is transmitted<br>
through the transmission. The method further includes monitoring commands<br>
affecting a requested output torque, monitoring a calculated output torque, and<br>
prioritizing between an input acceleration of the transmission and an output<br>
torque of the transmission based upon whether operating the transmission in<br>
the operating range state is in transient operation or stable operation.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0031] Referring now to the drawings, wherein the showings are for the<br>
purpose of illustrating certain exemplary embodiments only and not for the<br>
purpose of limiting the same, FIGS. 1 and 2 depict an exemplary electro-<br>
mechanical hybrid powertrain. The exemplary electro-mechanical hybrid<br>
powertrain in accordance with the present disclosure is depicted in FIG. 1,<br>
comprising a two-mode, compound-split, electro-mechanical hybrid<br>
transmission 10 operatively connected to an engine 14 and first and second<br>
electric machines ('MG-A') 56 and ('MG-B') 72. The engine 14 and first and<br>
second electric machines 56 and 72 each generate power which can be<br>
transmitted to the transmission 10. The power generated by the engine 14 and<br>
the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 and transmitted to the<br>
transmission 10 is described in terms of input torques, referred to herein as TI,<br>
TA, and TB respectively, and speed, referred to herein as NI, NA, and NB,<br>
respectively.<br>
[0032] The exemplary engine 14 comprises a multi-cylinder internal<br>
combustion engine selectively operative in several states to transmit torque to<br>
the transmission 10 via an input shaft 12, and can be either a spark-ignition or<br>
a compression-ignition engine. The engine 14 includes a crankshaft (not<br>
shown) operatively coupled to the input shaft 12 of the transmission 10. A<br>
rotational speed sensor 11 monitors rotational speed of the input shaft 12.<br>
Power output from the engine 14, comprising rotational speed and output<br>
torque, can differ from the input speed, NI, and the input torque, TI, to the<br>
transmission 10 due to placement of torque-consuming components on the<br><br>
input shaft 12 between the engine 14 and the transmission 10, e.g., a hydraulic<br>
pump (not shown) and/or a torque management device (not shown).<br>
[0033] The exemplary transmission 10 comprises three planetary-gear sets<br>
24, 26 and 28, and four selectively engageable torque-transmitting devices,<br>
i.e., clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75. As used herein, clutches refer<br>
to any type of friction torque transfer device including single or compound<br>
plate clutches or packs, band clutches, and brakes, for example. A hydraulic<br>
control circuit 42, preferably controlled by a transmission control module<br>
(hereafter 'TCM') 17, is operative to control clutch states. Clutches C2 62 and<br>
C4 75 preferably comprise hydraulically-applied rotating friction clutches.<br>
Clutches C1 70 and C3 73 preferably comprise hydraulically-controlled<br>
stationary devices that can be selectively grounded to a transmission case 68.<br>
Each of the clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75 is preferably<br>
hydraulically applied, selectively receiving pressurized hydraulic fluid via the<br>
hydraulic control circuit 42.<br>
[0034] The first and second electric machines 56 and 72 preferably comprise<br>
three-phase AC machines, each including a stator (not shown) and a rotor (not<br>
shown), and respective resolvers 80 and 82. The motor stator for each<br>
machine is grounded to an outer portion of the transmission case 68, and<br>
includes a stator core with coiled electrical windings extending therefrom.<br>
The rotor for the first electric machine 56 is supported on a hub plate gear that<br>
is operatively attached to shaft 60 via the second planetary gear set 26. The<br>
rotor for the second electric machine 72 is fixedly attached to a sleeve shaft<br>
hub 66.<br><br>
[0035] Each of the resolvers 80 and 82 preferably comprises a variable<br>
reluctance device including a resolver stator (not shown) and a resolver rotor<br>
(not shown). The resolvers 80 and 82 are appropriately positioned and<br>
assembled on respective ones of the first and second electric machines 56 and<br>
72. Stators of respective ones of the resolvers 80 and 82 are operatively<br>
connected to one of the stators for the first and second electric machines 56<br>
and 72. The resolver rotors are operatively connected to the rotor for the<br>
corresponding first and second electric machines 56 and 72. Each of the<br>
resolvers 80 and 82 is signally and operatively connected to a transmission<br>
power inverter control module (hereafter 'TPIM') 19, and each senses and<br>
monitors rotational position of the resolver rotor relative to the resolver stator.<br>
thus monitoring rotational position of respective ones of first and second<br>
electric machines 56 and 72. Additionally, the signals output from the<br>
resolvers 80 and 82 are interpreted to provide the rotational speeds for first<br>
and second electric machines 56 and 72, i.e., NAand NB, respectively.<br>
[0036] The transmission 10 includes an output member 64, e.g. a shaft,<br>
which is operably connected to a driveline 90 for a vehicle (not shown), to<br>
provide output power, e.g., to vehicle wheels 93, one of which is shown in<br>
FIG. 1. The output power is characterized in terms of an output rotational<br>
speed, No and an output torque, TO. A transmission output speed sensor 84<br>
monitors rotational speed and rotational direction of the output member 64.<br>
Each of the vehicle wheels 93, is preferably equipped with a sensor 94 adapted<br>
to monitor wheel speed, VSS-WHL, the output of which is monitored by a<br>
control module of a distributed control module system described with respect<br><br>
to FIG. 2, to determine vehicle speed, and absolute and relative wheel speeds<br>
for braking control, traction control, and vehicle acceleration management.<br>
[0037] The input torques from the engine 14 and the first and second electric<br>
machines 56 and 72 (TI, TA, and TB respectively) are generated as a result of<br>
energy conversion from fuel or electrical potential stored in an electrical<br>
energy storage device (hereafter 'ESD') 74. The ESD 74 is high voltage DC-<br>
coupled to the TPIM 19 via DC transfer conductors 27. The transfer<br>
conductors 27 include a contactor switch 38. When the contactor switch 38 is<br>
closed, under normal operation, electric current can flow between the ESD 74<br>
and the TPIM 19. When the contactor switch 38 is opened electric current<br>
flow between the ESD 74 and the TPIM 19 is interrupted. The TPIM 19<br>
transmits electrical power to and from the first electric machine 56 by transfer<br>
conductors 29, and the TPIM 19 similarly transmits electrical power to and<br>
from the second electric machine 72 by transfer conductors 31, in response to<br>
torque requests to the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 to achieve<br>
the input torques TA and TB. Electrical current is transmitted to and from the<br>
ESD 74 in accordance with whether the ESD 74 is being charged or<br>
discharged.<br>
[0038] The TPIM 19 includes the pair of power inverters (not shown) and<br>
respective motor control modules (not shown) configured to receive the torque<br>
commands and control inverter states therefrom for providing motor drive or<br>
regeneration functionality to meet the commanded motor torques TA and TB.<br>
The power inverters comprise known complementary three-phase power<br>
electronics devices, and each includes a plurality of insulated gate bipolar<br>
transistors (not shown) for converting DC power from the ESD 74 to AC<br><br><br>
power for powering respective ones of the first and second electric machines<br>
56 and 72, by switching at high frequencies. The insulated gate bipolar<br>
transistors form a switch mode power supply configured to receive control<br>
commands. There is typically one pair of insulated gate bipolar transistors for<br>
each phase of each of the three-phase electric machines. States of the<br>
insulated gate bipolar transistors are controlled to provide motor drive<br>
mechanical power generation or electric power regeneration functionality.<br>
The three-phase inverters receive or supply DC electric power via DC transfer<br>
conductors 27 and transform it to or from three-phase AC power, which is<br>
conducted to or from the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 for<br>
operation as motors or generators via transfer conductors 29 and 31<br>
respectively.<br>
[0039] FIG. 2 is a schematic block diagram of the distributed control module<br>
system. The elements described hereinafter comprise a subset of an overall<br>
vehicle control architecture, and provide coordinated system control of the<br>
exemplary powertrain described in FIG. 1. The distributed control module<br>
system synthesizes pertinent information and inputs, and executes algorithms<br>
to control various actuators to achieve control objectives, including objectives<br>
related to fuel economy, emissions, performance, drivability, and protection of<br>
hardware, including batteries of ESD 74 and the first and second electric<br>
machines 56 and 72. The distributed control module system includes an<br>
engine control module (hereafter 'ECM') 23, the TCM 17, a battery pack<br>
control module (hereafter 'BPCM') 21, and the TPIM 19. A hybrid control<br>
module (hereafter 'HCP') 5 provides supervisory control and coordination of<br>
the ECM 23, the TCM 17, the BPCM 21, and the TPIM 19. A user interface<br><br><br>
('UI') 13 is operatively connected to a plurality of devices through which a<br>
vehicle operator controls or directs operation of the electro-mechanical hybrid<br>
powertrain. The devices include an accelerator pedal 113 ('AP') from which<br>
an operator torque request is determined, an operator brake pedal 112 ('BP\), a<br>
transmission gear selector 114 ('PRNDL'), and a vehicle speed cruise control<br>
(not shown). The transmission gear selector 114 may have a discrete number<br>
of operator-selectable positions, including the rotational direction of the output<br>
member 64 to enable one of a forward and a reverse direction.<br>
[0040] The aforementioned control modules communicate with other control<br>
modules, sensors, and actuators via a local area network (hereafter 'LAN') bus<br>
6. The LAN bus 6 allows for structured communication of states of operating<br>
parameters and actuator command signals between the various control<br>
modules. The specific communication protocol utilized is application-specific.<br>
The LAN bus 6 and appropriate protocols provide for robust messaging and<br>
multi-control module interfacing between the aforementioned control<br>
modules, and other control modules providing functionality such as antilock<br>
braking, traction control, and vehicle stability. Multiple communications<br>
buses may be used to improve communications speed and provide some level<br>
of signal redundancy and integrity. Communication between individual<br>
control modules can also be effected using a direct link, e.g., a serial<br>
peripheral interface ('SPP) bus (not shown).<br>
[0041] The HCP 5 provides supervisory control of the powertrain, serving to<br>
coordinate operation of the ECM 23, TCM 17, TPIM 19, and BPCM 21.<br>
Based upon various input signals from the user interface 13 and the<br>
powertrain, including the ESD 74, the HCP 5 generates various commands.<br><br><br>
including: the operator torque request (T0O_REQ'), a commanded output torque<br>
('TCMD') to the driveline 90, an engine input torque request, clutch torques for<br>
the torque-transfer clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, C4 75 of the transmission<br>
10; and the torque requests for the first and second electric machines 56 and<br>
72, respectively. The TCM 17 is operatively connected to the hydraulic<br>
control circuit 42 and provides various functions including monitoring various<br>
pressure sensing devices (not shown) and generating and communicating<br>
control signals to various solenoids (not shown) thereby controlling pressure<br>
switches and control valves contained within the hydraulic control circuit 42.<br>
[0042] The ECM 23 is operatively connected to the engine 14, and functions<br>
to acquire data from sensors and control actuators of the engine 14 over a<br>
plurality of discrete lines, shown for simplicity as an aggregate bi-directional<br>
interface cable 35. The ECM 23 receives the engine input torque request from<br>
the HCP 5. The ECM 23 determines the actual engine input torque, TI„<br>
provided to the transmission 10 at that point in time based upon monitored<br>
engine speed and load, which is communicated to the HCP 5. The ECM 23<br>
monitors input from the rotational speed sensor 11 to determine the engine<br>
input speed to the input shaft 12, which translates to the transmission input<br>
speed, NI. The ECM 23 monitors inputs from sensors (not shown) to<br>
determine states of other engine operating parameters including, e.g., a<br>
manifold pressure, engine coolant temperature, ambient air temperature, and<br>
ambient pressure. The engine load can be determined, for example, from the<br>
manifold pressure, or alternatively, from monitoring operator input to the<br>
accelerator pedal 113. The ECM 23 generates and communicates command<br><br>
signals to control engine actuators, including, e.g., fuel injectors, ignition<br>
modules, and throttle control modules, none of which are shown.<br>
[0043] The TCM 17 is operatively connected to the transmission 10 and<br>
monitors inputs from sensors (not shown) to determine states of transmission<br>
operating parameters. The TCM 17 generates and communicates command<br>
signals to control the transmission 10, including controlling the hydraulic<br>
control circuit 42. Inputs from the TCM 17 to the HCP 5 include estimated<br>
clutch torques for each of the clutches, i.e., C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75,<br>
and rotational output speed, No, of the output member 64. Other actuators and<br>
sensors may be used to provide additional information from the TCM 17 to the<br>
HCP 5 for control purposes. The TCM 17 monitors inputs from pressure<br>
switches (not shown) and selectively actuates pressure control solenoids (not<br>
shown) and shift solenoids (not shown) of the hydraulic control circuit 42 to<br>
selectively actuate the various clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75 to<br>
achieve various transmission operating range states, as described hereinbeiow.<br>
[0044] The BPCM 21 is signally connected to sensors (not shown) to<br>
monitor the ESD 74, including states of electrical current and voltage<br>
parameters, to provide information indicative of parametric states of the<br>
batteries of the ESD 74 to the HCP 5. The parametric states of the batteries<br>
preferably include battery state-of-charge, battery voltage, battery temperature,<br>
and available battery power, referred to as a range PBAT_MIN to PBAT_MAX<br>
[0045] Each of the control modules ECM 23, TCM 17, TPIM 19 and BPCM<br>
21 is preferably a general-purpose digital computer comprising a<br>
microprocessor or central processing unit, storage mediums comprising read<br>
only memory ('ROM'), random access memory ('RAM'), electrically<br><br><br>
programmable read only memory ('EPROM'), a high speed clock, analog to<br>
digital ('A/D') and digital to analog ('D/A') circuitry, and input/output<br>
circuitry and devices ('I/O') and appropriate signal conditioning and buffer<br>
circuitry. Each of the control modules has a set of control algorithms,<br>
comprising resident program instructions and calibrations stored in one of the<br>
storage mediums and executed to provide the respective functions of each<br>
computer. Information transfer between the control modules is preferably<br>
accomplished using the LAN bus € and SPI buses. The control algorithms are<br>
executed during preset loop cycles such that each algorithm is executed at<br>
least once each loop cycle. Algorithms stored in the non-volatile memory<br>
devices are executed by one of the central processing units to monitor inputs<br>
from the sensing devices and execute control and diagnostic routines to<br>
control operation of the actuators, using preset calibrations. Loop cycles are<br>
executed at regular intervals, for example each 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25 and 100<br>
milliseconds during ongoing operation of the powertrain. Alternatively,<br>
algorithms may be executed in response to the occurrence of an event.<br>
[0046] The exemplary powertrain selectively operates in one of several<br>
operating range states that can be described in terms of an engine state<br>
comprising one of an engine on state ('ON') and an engine off state ('OFF'),<br>
and a transmission state comprising a plurality of fixed gears and continuously<br>
variable operating modes, described with reference to Table 1, below.<br><br><br>
[0047] Each of the transmission operating range states is described in the<br>
table and indicates which of the specific clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73. and C4<br>
75 are applied for each of the operating range states. A first continuously<br>
variable mode, i.e., EVT Mode 1, or Ml, is selected by applying clutch C1 70<br>
only in order to "ground" the outer gear member of the third planetary gear set<br>
28. The engine state can be one of ON ('Ml_Eng_On') or OFF<br>
('Ml_Eng_Off). A second continuously variable mode, i.e., EVT Mode 2. or<br>
M2, is selected by applying clutch C2 62 only to connect the shaft 60 to the<br>
carrier of the third planetary gear set 28. The engine state can be one of ON<br>
('M2_Eng_On') or OFF ('M2_Eng_Off). For purposes of this description,<br>
when the engine state is OFF, the engine input speed is equal to zero<br>
revolutions per minute ('RPM'), i.e., the engine crankshaft is not rotating. A<br>
fixed gear operation provides a fixed ratio operation of input-to-output speed<br>
of the transmission 10, i.e., NI/No, is achieved. A first fixed gear operation<br>
('Gl') is selected by applying clutches C1 70 and C4 75. A second fixed gear<br><br>
operation ('G2') is selected by applying clutches C1 70 and C2 62. A third<br>
fixed gear operation ('G3') is selected by applying clutches C2 62 and C4 75.<br>
A fourth fixed gear operation ('G4') is selected by applying clutches C2 62<br>
and C3 73. The fixed ratio operation of input-to-output speed increases with<br>
increased fixed gear operation due to decreased gear ratios in the planetary<br>
gears 24,26, and 28. The rotational speeds of the first and second electric<br>
machines 56 and 72, NA and NB respectively, are dependent on internal<br>
rotation of the mechanism as defined by the clutching and are proportional to<br>
the input speed measured at the input shaft 12.<br>
[0048] In response to operator input via the accelerator pedal 113 and brake<br>
pedal 112 as captured by the user interface 13, the HCP 5 and one or more of<br>
the other control modules determine the commanded output torque, TCMD,<br>
intended to meet the operator torque request, To REQ, to be executed at the<br>
output member 64 and transmitted to the driveline 90. Final vehicle<br>
acceleration is affected by other factors including, e.g., road load, road grade,<br>
and vehicle mass. The operating range state is determined for the transmission<br>
10 based upon a variety of operating characteristics of the powertrain. This<br>
includes the operator torque request, communicated through the accelerator<br>
pedal 113 and brake pedal 112 to the user interface 13 as previously described.<br>
The operating range state may be predicated on a powertrain torque demand<br>
caused by a command to operate the first and second electric machines 56 and<br>
72 in an electrical energy generating mode or in a torque generating mode.<br>
The operating range state can be determined by an optimization algorithm or<br>
routine, initiated for example within a hybrid strategic control module of the<br>
HCP 5, which determines optimum system efficiency based upon operator<br><br><br>
demand for power, battery state of charge, and energy efficiencies of the<br>
engine 14 and the first and second electric machines 56 and 72. The control<br>
system manages torque inputs from the engine 14 and the first and second<br>
electric machines 56 and 72 based upon an outcome of the executed<br>
optimization routine, and system efficiencies are optimized thereby, to manage<br>
fuel economy and battery charging. Furthermore, operation can be determined<br>
based upon a fault in a component or system. The HCP 5 monitors the torque-<br>
generative devices, and determines the power output from the transmission 10<br>
required to achieve the desired output torque to meet the operator torque<br>
request. As should be apparent from the description above, the ESD 74 and<br>
the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 are electrically-operatively<br>
coupled for power flow therebetween. Furthermore, the engine 14, the first<br>
and second electric machines 56 and 72, and the electro-mechanical<br>
transmission 10 are mechanically-operatively coupled to transmit power<br>
therebetween to generate a power flow to the output member 64.<br>
[0049] As discussed above, managing output torque in order to maintain<br>
drivability is a priority in controlling a hybrid powertrain. Any change in<br>
torque in response to a change in output torque request applied through the<br>
transmission results in a change to the output torque applied to the driveline,<br>
thereby resulting in a change in propelling force to the vehicle and a change in<br>
vehicle acceleration. The change in torque request can come from operator<br>
input, such a pedal position relating an operator torque request, automatic<br>
control changes in the vehicle, such as cruise control or other control strategy,<br>
or engine changes in response to environmental conditions, such as a vehicle<br>
experiencing an uphill or downhill grade. By controlling changes to various<br><br><br>
input torques applied to a transmission within a hybrid powertrain, abrupt<br>
changes in vehicle acceleration can be controlled and minimized in order to<br>
reduce adverse effects to drivability.<br>
[0050] As is known by one having ordinary skill in the art, any control<br>
system includes a reaction time. Changes to a powertrain operating point,<br>
comprising the speeds and torques of the various components to the<br>
powertrain required to achieve the desired vehicle operation, are driven by<br>
changes in control signals. These control signal changes act upon the various<br>
components to the powertrain and create reactions in each according to their<br>
respective reaction times. Applied to a hybrid powertrain, any change in<br>
control signals indicating a new torque request, for instance, as driven by a<br>
change in operator torque request or as required to execute a transmission<br>
shift, creates reactions in each affected torque generating device in order to<br>
execute the required changes to respective input torques. Changes to input<br>
torque supplied from an engine are controlled by an engine torque request<br>
setting the torque generated by the engine, as controlled, for example, through<br>
an ECM. Reaction time within an engine to changes in torque request to an<br>
engine is impacted by a number of factors well known in the art, and the<br>
particulars of a change to engine operation depend heavily on the particulars<br>
of the engine employed and the mode or modes of combustion being utilized.<br>
In many circumstances, the reaction time of an engine to changes in torque<br>
request will be the longest reaction time of the components to the hybrid drive<br>
system. Reaction time within an electric machine to changes in torque request<br>
include time to activate any necessary switches, relays, or other controls and<br><br>
time to energize or de-energize the electric machine with the change in applied<br>
electrical power.<br>
[0051] FIG. 3 graphically depicts reaction times of exemplary hybrid<br>
powertrain components to changes in torque request, in accordance with the<br>
present disclosure. Components to an exemplary hybrid powertrain system<br>
including an engine and two electric machines are exemplified. Torque<br>
requests and resulting changes in input torque produced by each torque<br>
generating device are illustrated. As described above, the data shows that<br>
electric machines quickly respond to changes in torque requests, whereas the<br>
engine follows changes in torque requests more slowly.<br>
[0052] A method is disclosed wherein reactions times of the engine and of<br>
the electric machine or machines within a hybrid powertrain are utilized to<br>
control in parallel an lead immediate torque request, controlling the engine,<br>
and an immediate torque request, controlling the electric machines, the torque<br>
requests being coordinated by respective reaction times in order to<br>
substantially effect simultaneous changes to input torque.<br>
[0053] Because, as discussed above, changes to input torque from the engine<br>
are known to involve consistently longer reactions times than changes to input<br>
torque from an electric machine, an exemplary embodiment of the disclosed<br>
method can implement changes in torque request to the engine and the electric<br>
machine, acting in parallel as described above, including a lead period to the<br>
more quickly reacting device, the electric motor. This lead period may be<br>
developed experimentally, empirically, predictively, through modeling or<br>
other techniques adequate to accurately predict engine and electric machine<br>
operation, and a multitude of lead periods might be used by the same hybrid<br><br><br>
powertrain, depending upon different engine settings, conditions, operating<br>
and ranges and vehicle conditions. An exemplary equation that can be used in<br>
conjunction with test data or estimates of device reaction times to calculate<br>
lead period in accordance with the present disclosure includes the following<br>
Eq. 1:<br>
TLead - TLead Reaction - TImmediate Reaction	[1]<br>
wherein TLead equals the lead period for use in methods described herein. This<br>
equation assumes that two torque producing devices are utilized. TLead Reaction<br>
represents the reaction time of the device with the longer reaction time, and<br>
TImmediate Reaction represents the reaction time of the device with the shorter<br>
reaction time. If a different system is utilized, comprising for example, an<br>
engine with a long lead period, a first electric machine with an intermediate<br>
lead period, and a second electric machine with a short lead period, lead<br>
periods can be developed comparing all of the torque generating devices. In<br>
this exemplary system, if all three torque generating devices are involved, two<br>
lead periods, one for the engine as compared to each of the electric machines,<br>
will be utilized to synchronize the responses in each of the devices. The same<br>
system at a different time might be operating with the engine off and<br>
disengaged from the transmission, and a lead period comparing the first<br>
electric machine and the second electric machine will be utilized to<br>
synchronize the responses in the two electric machines. In this way, a lead<br>
period can be developed coordinating reaction times between various torque<br>
generating devices can be developed.<br><br><br>
[0054] One exemplary method to utilize lead periods to implement parallel<br>
torque requests to distinct torque generating devices in order to effect<br>
substantially simultaneous changes to output torque in response to a change in<br>
operator torque request includes issuing substantially immediately a change to<br>
the engine torque immediate request, initiating within the engine a change to a<br>
new engine output torque. This new engine output torque, in conjunction with<br>
the electric motor operating state, is still managed by the HCP in order to<br>
provide some portion of the total input torque to the transmission required to<br>
propel the vehicle. From the point that the engine torque immediate request<br>
changes, the lead period expires, described above taking into account the<br>
differences in reaction times between the engine and the electric machine.<br>
After the lead period, a change to torque requests issued to the electric<br>
machine or machines, managed by the HCP in order to fulfill a portion of the<br>
operator torque request, is executed, and the electric machine changes the<br>
electric machine operating state, and as described above, the changes to the<br>
input torques provided by the engine and the electric machine change<br>
substantially simultaneously.<br>
[0055] As described in the disclosed method above, engine torque immediate<br>
requests and torque requests to an electric machine are disclosed for use in<br>
parallel to control distinct torque generative devices with different reaction<br>
times to reaction to changes in operator torque request. Changes in operator<br>
torque request can include a simple change in desired output torque within a<br>
particular transmission operating range state, or changes in operator torque<br>
request can be required in conjunction with a transmission shift between<br>
different operating range states. Changes to operator torque requests in<br><br><br>
conjunction with a transmission shift are more complex than changes<br>
contained within a single operating range state because torques and shaft<br>
speeds of the various hybrid powertrain components must be managed in order<br>
to transition torque applied from a first clutch and to a second previously not<br>
applied clutch without the occurrence of slip, as described above.<br>
[0056] Shifts within a transmission, such as the exemplary transmission of<br>
FIG. 1, frequently involve unloading a first clutch, transitioning through an<br>
inertia speed phase state, and subsequently loading a second clutch. Within<br>
the transmission of a conventionally powered vehicle utilizing an engine only,<br>
the change within a transmission from one fixed gear state to another fixed<br>
gear state frequently includes unloading a first clutch, allowing the vehicle to<br>
briefly coast, and then loading a second clutch. However, as described in<br>
relation to FIG. 1 and Table 1, above, clutches within a hybrid powertrain<br>
transmission are frequently applied in pairs or groups, and a shift within the<br>
transmission can involve only unloading one of the applied clutches and<br>
subsequently loading another clutch while maintaining engagement of a third<br>
clutch throughout the shift. FIG. 4 demonstrates gear transition relationships<br>
for an exemplary hybrid powertrain transmission, in particular as described in<br>
the exemplary embodiment of FIG. 1 and Table 1, in accordance with the<br>
present disclosure. NI is plotted against NO At any fixed gear state. No is<br>
determined by the corresponding NI along the fixed gear state plots. Operation<br>
in either EVT Mode 1 or EVT Mode 2, wherein a continuously variable gear<br>
ratio is utilized to power from a fixed input speed can take place in the<br>
respective zones illustrated on the graph. Clutch states, C1 - C4, as described<br>
in the exemplary embodiment of FIG. 1, are described in Table 1. For<br><br><br>
instance, operation in a second fixed gear state requires clutches C1 and C2 to<br>
be applied or loaded and clutches C3 and C4 to be not applied or unloaded.<br>
While FIG. 4 describes gear transitions possible in the exemplary powertrain<br>
illustrated in FIG. 1, it will be appreciated by one having ordinary skill in the<br>
art that such a description of gear transitions is possible for any transmission<br>
of a hybrid powertrain, and the disclosure is not intended to be limited to the<br>
particular embodiment described herein.<br>
[0057] FIG. 4 can describe operation of an exemplary system in a fixed gear<br>
state or EVT mode, as described above, and it can also be used to describe<br>
shift transitions between the various transmission operating range states. The<br>
areas and plots on the graph describe operation of the operating range states<br>
through transitions. For example, transitions between fixed gear states within<br>
an EVT mode region require transient operation in the EVT mode between the<br>
fixed gear states. Similarly, transition from EVT Mode 1 to EVT Mode 2<br>
requires a transition through the second fixed gear state, located at the<br>
boundary between the two modes.<br>
[0058] In accordance with FIGS. 1 and 4 and Table 1, an exemplary<br>
transmission shift from a third fixed gear state to a fourth fixed gear state is<br>
further described. Referring to FIG. 4, both the beginning and the preferred<br>
operating range states exist within the area of EVT Mode 2. Therefore, a<br>
transition from the third gear state to the fourth gear state requires first a shift<br>
from the third fixed gear state to EVT Mode 2 and then a shift from EVT<br>
Mode 2 to the fourth fixed gear state. Referring to Table 1, a hybrid<br>
powertrain transmission, beginning in a third fixed gear state, will have<br>
clutches C2 and C4 applied. Table 1 further describes operation in EVT<br><br><br>
Mode 2, the destination of the first shift, to include clutch C2 applied.<br>
Therefore, a shift from the third fixed gear state to EVT Mode 2 requires<br>
clutch C4 to be changed from an applied to a not applied state and requires<br>
that clutch C2 remain applied. Additionally, Table 1 describes operation in<br>
the fourth fixed gear mode, the destination of the second shift, wherein<br>
clutches C2 and C3 are applied. Therefore, a shift from EVT Mode 2 to the<br>
fourth fixed gear state requires clutch C3 to be applied and loaded and requires<br>
that clutch C2 remain applied. Therefore, clutches C4 and C3 are transitioned<br>
through the exemplary shift, while clutch C2 remains applied and transmitting<br>
torque to the driveline throughout the shift event.<br>
[0059] Applied to the methods disclosed herein, changes in input torque<br>
through a transmission shift can be adjusted to reduce negative effects to<br>
drivability by coordinating signal commands to various torque generative<br>
devices based upon reaction times of the various components. As described<br>
above, many transmission shifts can be broken down into three phases: a first<br>
torque phase, during which an initially applied clutch is changed from a<br>
torque-bearing, locked, and synchronized clutch state to an unlocked and<br>
desynchronized clutch state; an inertia speed phase, during which affected<br>
clutches are unlocked and in transitional states; and a second torque phase,<br>
during which a second previously not applied clutch is changed from an<br>
unlocked and desynchronized clutch state to a torque-bearing, locked, and<br>
synchronized clutch state. As aforementioned, clutch slip is preferably<br>
avoided throughout transmission shifts to avoid adverse effects on drivability,<br>
and clutch slip is created when reactive torque applied across a clutch exceeds<br>
the actual torque capacity of the clutch. Therefore, within a transmission shift<br><br><br>
event, input torques must be managed in relation to the actual torque capacity<br>
of the currently applied clutch, such that the transmission shift can be<br>
accomplished without the occurrence of slip.<br>
[0060] While a process can be utilized to perform necessary steps in a clutch<br>
loading or unloading event in sequence, with the torque capacity of the clutch<br>
being maintained in excess of reactive torques, time involved in an unlocking<br>
transition is also important to drivability. Therefore, it is advantageous to<br>
perform associated torque requests and clutch capacity commands in parallel<br>
while still acting to prevent slip. Such parallel implementation of control<br>
changes intending to effect clutch state changes associated with a transmission<br>
shift preferably occur in as short of a time-span as possible. Therefore.<br>
coordination of torque capacity within the clutches involved in the<br>
transmission shift to the torque requests, both to the engine and to the electric<br>
machine, as described in the exemplary embodiment above, is also important<br>
to maintaining drivability through a transmission shift. FIGS. 5-7 depict<br>
exemplary processes combining to accomplish an exemplary transmission<br>
shift, in accordance with the present disclosure.<br>
[0061] FIG. 5 is a graphical representation of torque terms associated with a<br>
clutch through an exemplary transitional unlocking state, in accordance with<br>
the present disclosure. Lines illustrated at the left extreme of the graph depict<br>
clutch operation in a locked state. The graph depicts clutch command torque<br>
by a clutch control system and a resulting estimated torque capacity. Clutch<br>
torque capacity in a clutch resulting from a command torque is a result of<br>
many factors, including available clamping pressure, design and conditional<br>
factors of the clutch, reaction time in the clutch to changes in the clutch<br><br><br>
control system. As demonstrated in the exemplary data of the graph in the<br>
initial locked region, it is known to command a torque to a locked clutch in<br>
excess of the clutch capacity and allow the other factors affecting the clutch to<br>
determine the resulting clutch capacity. Also at the left extreme of the graph<br>
depicting clutch operation in a locked state, estimated reactive torque applied<br>
to the clutch as a result of input torque from the engine and electric machine<br>
torques is depicted. At the time labeled "Initiate Unlocking State", logic<br>
within the clutch control system or the TCM, having determined a need to<br>
transition the clutch from locked to unlocked states, changes the command<br>
torque to some level lower than the torque capacity but still higher than the<br>
reactive torque currently applied to the clutch. At this point, mechanisms<br>
within the clutch control system, for example, variable pressure control<br>
solenoids within an exemplary hydraulic clutch control system, change<br>
settings to modulate the clamping force within the clutch. As a result, torque<br>
capacity of the clutch begins to change as the clamping force applied to the<br>
clutch changes. As discussed above, the clutch reacts to a change in command<br>
torque over a reaction time, and reaction time for a particular clutch will<br>
depend upon the particulars of the application. In the exemplary graph of FIG.<br>
5, torque capacity reacts to a reduction in command torque and begins to<br>
reduce accordingly.<br>
[0062] As mentioned above, during the same unlocking state, reactive torque<br>
resulting from input torque and electric machine torques must also be<br>
unloaded from the clutch. Undesirable slip results if the reactive torque is not<br>
maintained below the torque capacity throughout the unlocking state. Upon<br>
initiation of the unlocking state, at substantially the same point on FIG. 5<br><br><br>
where the torque capacity is reduced to initiate the unlocking state, limits are<br>
initiated and imposed upon input torques from the engine and the electric<br>
machine in order to accomplish a ramping down of each to zero. As described<br>
in the method disclosed herein and in exemplary embodiments described<br>
above, changes to limits including a engine torque immediate request and an<br>
immediate torque request are executed in a coordinated process, implementing<br>
a lead period calibrated to the reaction times of the various torque providing<br>
devices, such that the resulting input torques from the devices are reduced<br>
substantially simultaneously. FIG. 5 illustrates a method to perform this<br>
coordinated change to torque requests by imposing limits upon torque requests<br>
in the form of a clutch reactive torque lead immediate min/max constraining<br>
the engine torque immediate request and a clutch reactive torque immediate<br>
min/max constraining the torque request to the electric machine. These<br>
maximum reactive torque values represent the maximum torque that is<br>
permitted to be commanded from each torque providing device: the actual<br>
engine torque immediate request and the actual immediate torque request can<br>
be less than the maximum reactive torque values, but as the maximum values<br>
reduce, so the actual torque request values will also eventually reduce. The<br>
input torques from the engine and electric machine together provide, each up<br>
to the defined maximum values, some portion of the overall input torques,<br>
with the portion of each being controlled by the HCP. As a result of the<br>
calibrated lead period, both the clutch reactive torque lead immediate min/max<br>
and the clutch reactive torque immediate min/max reduce applied reactive<br>
torque to the clutch at substantially the same time, resulting in the reduction to<br>
the actual clutch reactive torque as illustrated in FIG. 5. As will be<br><br><br>
appreciated by one having ordinary skill in the art, other safeguards will<br>
additionally need to be utilized to ensure that the torque capacity remains in<br>
excess of the reactive torque throughout the unloading process. Many such<br>
methods are contemplated, and an exemplary set of terms which might be used<br>
are depicted on FIG. 5. For instance, a calibrated offset term can be used to<br>
ensure that the command setting the clutch capacity remains in excess of the<br>
actual clutch reactive torque until the actual torque passes below some<br>
threshold. An exemplary threshold for such a purpose is defined in FIG. 5 as<br>
the calibrated threshold for reactive torque. In maintaining this torque<br>
capacity request above the actual clutch reactive torque, and remembering that<br>
all devices include a reaction time to request changes, including the clutch<br>
clamping mechanism, the delay in the change to torque capacity in response to<br>
clutch command changes in combination with this offset term will maintain<br>
the torque capacity in excess of the actual clutch reactive torque.<br>
Additionally, another threshold, a calibrated threshold for torque estimate, can<br>
be used to define the end of the torque phase. For instance, if an estimate of<br>
the clutch torque capacity, as determined by an algorithm modeling clutch<br>
operation, stays below this threshold through a calibrated period of time, then<br>
the clutch can be determined to be in an unlocked state.<br>
[0063] FIG. 6 is a graphical representation of torque terms associated with a<br>
clutch through an exemplary transitional locking state, in accordance with the<br>
present disclosure. As described above, within many transmission shift<br>
events, a second clutch is synchronized and locked, and torque is applied to<br>
the clutch. Lines illustrated at the left extreme of the graph depict clutch<br>
operation in an unlocked state. The initiation of locking state requires a series<br><br><br>
of subordinate commands necessary to transition the clutch from an unlocked<br>
state to a locked state. As described above in relation to a transition to a<br>
second torque phase within a transmission shift, the clutch, including the shaft<br>
connected to the oncoming torque providing shafts and the shaft connected to<br>
the output member, must be synchronized. Once the clutch connective<br>
surfaces attached to these shafts have been attenuated and are moving at the<br>
same rotational velocity, clamping force can begin to be applied to the clutch<br>
to bring the clutch to a locked state and begin increasing the torque capacity of<br>
the clutch. As described above with regards to avoiding slip during a torque<br>
phase, clutch capacity must be increased before reactive torque to the clutch<br>
can be increased. In order to enable the application of input torques resulting<br>
in a reactive torque across the clutch as rapidly as possible, an increase in<br>
clutch capacity can be commanded anticipatorily to achieve an initial increase<br>
in clutch capacity coincident with the clutch reaching a locked state. Reactive<br>
torques, taking into account reaction times by utilizing a lead period by the<br>
method disclosed herein, can then be timely commanded with a short lag to<br>
follow increasing clutch torque capacity. An exemplary embodiment of this<br>
method, acting in reverse of the limits imposed to torque requests as described<br>
in FIG. 5, imposes limits upon the torque requests which can be issued to the<br>
engine and to the electric machine according to a calibrated ramp rate, selected<br>
to avoid slip. As depicted in FIG. 6, a clutch reactive torque immediate<br>
min/max acting as a constraint upon electric machine torque requests is<br>
increased after a calibrated lead period from the initiation of an increasing<br>
clutch reactive torque lead immediate min/max acting as a constraint upon<br>
engine torque requests. By utilizing the lead period, the increase in input<br><br><br>
torques from the engine and the electric machine increase reactive torque<br>
applied to the clutch substantially simultaneously, according to the methods<br>
disclosed herein. As the limits upon the torque generating devices are lifted<br>
according to the calibrated ramp rate applied to each limit, the HCP can<br>
command the engine and the electric machine to fulfill a portion of the<br>
reactive torque required from the clutch, each up to the respective maximum.<br>
In this way, torque requests to the engine and the electric machine are<br>
coordinated in order to compensate for reaction times in order to increase<br>
input torques from each substantially simultaneously through a shift event.<br>
[0064] The calibrated ramp rate utilized in the above exemplary transmission<br>
shift is a selected value which will adjust input torque levels to the desired<br>
range quickly, but also will stay below the torque capacity for the clutch so as<br>
to avoid slip. The ramp rate may be developed experimentally, empirically,<br>
predictively, through modeling or other techniques adequate to accurately<br>
predict engine and electric machine operation, and a multitude of ramp rates<br>
might be used by the same hybrid powertrain, depending upon different engine<br>
settings, conditions, or operating ranges and behavior of the control system<br>
actuating the clutch torque capacity. The ramp rate used to decrease input<br>
torques in an unlocking event can but need not be an inverse of the ramp rate<br>
used to increase input torques in a locking event. Similarly, the lead period<br>
used to coordinate input torques can but need not be the same time span value<br>
utilized in both transmission transitional states and can be varied according to<br>
particular behaviors of a vehicle and its components.<br>
[0065] As described above, during a transmission shift, for example,<br>
between two fixed gear states as defined in the exemplary transmission<br><br><br>
described above, the transmission passes through an inertia speed phase<br>
between a first torque phase and a second torque phase. During this inertia<br>
speed phase, the originally applied clutch and the clutch to be applied are in an<br>
unlocked state, and the input is initially spinning with a rotational velocity that<br>
was shared across the first clutch just prior to becoming unsynchronized. In<br>
order to accomplish synchronization within the second clutch to be applied<br>
and loaded in the second torque phase, inputs to be connected to the second<br>
clutch must change Nj to match the driveline attached through the<br>
transmission at some new gear ratio. A number of methods are known in the<br>
art to accomplish this synchronization. However, within a shift in a hybrid<br>
powertrain transmission, shifts usually occur through range operating state<br>
where at least one clutch is still applied while another clutch is in an inertia<br>
speed phase. This means that changes to the various torque generative devices<br>
required to create synchronization in the input speed and output speed of the<br>
second clutch still impact vehicle performance in the inertia speed phase<br>
through the still applied clutch. Therefore, the methods described herein to<br>
utilize a lead period to effect changes to input torques substantially<br>
simultaneously can additionally present advantages to drivability can continue<br>
to be utilized through an inertia speed phase.<br>
[0066] An exemplary method to accomplish this synchronization through an<br>
inertia speed phase of a transmission shift is graphically depicted in FIG. 7, in<br>
accordance with the present disclosure. The effects of the transmission shift<br>
upon two terms descriptive of the shifting process are illustrated in two<br>
sections with a common timescale. The top section depicts NI, initially<br>
connected through the first, initially applied clutch. The upper dotted line<br><br><br>
represents the velocity profile of N, while the first clutch is in a locked state<br>
before initiation of the shift. The bottom dotted line represents the velocity<br>
profile of NI that must be achieved to synchronize the input speed with the<br>
output speed of the second clutch. The transition between the two dotted lines<br>
represents the change to input speed that must take place to accomplish the<br>
shift. The bottom section of FIG. 7 depicts input acceleration (NI_DOT), or a<br>
derivative with respect to time of NI. NI_DOT is described in this case as the<br>
input acceleration immediate or the acceleration profile driven with a<br>
relatively quick reaction time by an electric machine or machines, and the<br>
term closely tracks actual NI_ DOT. The input acceleration immediate shows the<br>
change in the rate of speed which must be accomplished in order to transition<br>
the NI from an initial NI at the synchronous state with the first clutch to a<br>
target input speed at the synchronous state with the second clutch. The initial<br>
flat portion describes the acceleration with which the input speed is increased<br>
before the initiation of the shift, and this constant value reflects the slope of<br>
the input speed in the left portion of the top section of the FIG. 7. At the time<br>
of the initiation of the shift, based upon operator input such as pedal position<br>
and algorithms within the transmission control system, including determining<br>
a preferred operating range state, a determination is made regarding target<br>
input speed that will be required to achieve synchronization and the target<br>
input acceleration profile required to accomplish the shift. An input<br>
acceleration rate, calculated to support a target acceleration rate after the shift<br>
is completed, can be termed an input acceleration lead predicted and describes<br>
the NI_DOT that needs to exist after the inertia speed phase is completed. The<br>
input acceleration lead immediate is predicted through an algorithm factoring<br><br><br>
in operator requested torque, the preferred operating range state being<br>
transitioned to, and other relevant variables. Because, as described in the top<br>
portion of FIG. 7, NI must be changed through the inertia speed phase to<br>
accomplish the shift and because NI_DOT describes the rate of change of the NI,<br>
the NI_DOT of the device being controlled during the inertia speed phase must<br>
reflect the input speed change to be accomplished through the inertia speed<br>
phase. In the exemplary data displayed in FIG. 7, wherein the input speed<br>
needs to be reduced to accomplish the transmission shift, the NI_DOT of the<br>
device necessarily must change to a negative value representing the change in<br>
NI. Once NI has been reduced to a level enabling transition to the target input<br>
speed needed for synchronizing the input and output speeds, the NI_DOT<br>
changes to match the input acceleration lead predicted. In this way, NI and<br>
NI DOT can be controlled through an inertia speed phase to match a target input<br>
speed and target input acceleration necessary to achieve a smooth transmission<br>
shift.<br>
[0067] As described above, a transmission shift in a hybrid powertrain<br>
transmission requires transition between operating range states, wherein an<br>
inertia speed phase must be accomplished as described above, while at least<br>
one clutch is still applied and transferring torque from the torque producing<br>
devices to the driveline. Changes to input torques, driven by torque requests<br>
to the various torque generating devices, must accomplish both the required NI<br>
and NI_DOT changes and maintain drivability throughout the inertia speed<br>
phase. Therefore, exemplary methods described herein to utilize a lead period<br>
to effect changes to input torques substantially simultaneously can be utilized<br>
through an inertia speed phase to effect torque request changes to the various<br><br><br>
torque producing devices in order to effect substantially simultaneous changes<br>
to the input torques. FIG. 7 illustrates coordinating torque producing device<br>
reaction times, and a lead period calibrated to the difference in the related<br>
reaction times, to improve drivability in a transmission shift. An engine, as<br>
described above, includes the greater reaction time among torque generating<br>
devices. In order to adjust the NI and NI_DOT as quickly as possible to achieve<br>
the target speed and acceleration values for the shift, an input acceleration lead<br>
immediate is predicted through an algorithm. This input acceleration lead<br>
immediate includes the reaction time of the engine to changes in torque<br>
requests, and profiles the most rapid change in NI and NI_DOT in the lead<br>
device that can be accomplished to reach the target values. This rapid change<br>
in NI must include the aforementioned reaction time in the engine to changes<br>
in torque requests and the time the engine will take to accelerate or decelerate<br>
through the input acceleration lead immediate. As depicted in FIG. 7, the<br>
input acceleration lead immediate, in anticipation of a pending shift, can<br>
initiate requisite commands to the engine in anticipation of the inertia speed<br>
phase, as the resulting input torque from the engine will not begin to reduce<br>
until later, due to the relatively long engine reaction time. Once the input<br>
acceleration lead immediate has been determined, an input acceleration<br>
immediate, following the input acceleration lead immediate by a lead period,<br>
calibrated to reaction times as described above, can be utilized to control the<br>
electric machine to match changes in NI and NI_DOT at substantially the same<br>
time as the response from the engine. In this way, the engine and the electric<br>
machines are substantially synchronized in affecting the target input speed and<br>
target acceleration.<br><br><br>
[0068] The above methods describe torque management processes as a<br>
comparison of positive values. It will be appreciated by one having ordinary<br>
skill in the art that clutch torques are described as positive and negative<br>
torques, signifying torques applied in one rotational direction or the other.<br>
The above method can be used in either positive or negative torque<br>
applications, where the magnitudes of the torques are modulated in such a way<br>
that the magnitude of the applied reactive torque does not exceed the<br>
magnitude of the torque capacity for a particular clutch.<br>
[0069] An exemplary method to set total desired speed phase time based<br>
upon accelerator pedal position and initial input speed delta includes use of a<br>
calibrated 2D look-up table. FIG. 8 illustrates in tabular form use of an<br>
exemplary 2D look-up table to determine inertia speed phase times, in<br>
accordance with the present disclosure. Accelerator pedal position and the<br>
initial NI delta allow projection of a change required in NI, as describe above,<br>
which, in turn, allows estimation of an inertia speed phase time. Based upon<br>
the given inputs, an estimated inertia speed phase time can be estimated<br>
Values of the initial NI delta in the look-up table can span positive and<br>
negative values, allowing for different calibrations according to upshifts and<br>
downshifts.<br>
[0070] Once behavior of NI at the initiation of the inertia speed phase,<br>
behavior of a target NI based upon a desired operating range state, and a total<br>
desired speed phase time are established, a transition described by a input<br>
acceleration immediate profile can be described. As will be appreciated based<br>
upon any comparison of NI values versus time, wherein different operating<br>
range states have different projections of NI based upon NO, as is described by<br><br><br>
the dotted lines in the NI portions of FIG. 7, inertia speed phase NI curves are<br>
likely to take an S-shape, with transient sub-phases transitioning to and from<br>
the initial and target NI and NI_DOT values and a center sub-phase linking the<br>
sub-phases. By dividing an inertia speed phase into three sub-phases,<br>
necessary transitions to an input acceleration immediate profile can be<br>
described. FIG. 9 describes an exemplary inertia speed phase divided into<br>
three sub-phases, in accordance with the present disclosure. Sub-phase 1<br>
describes a transition from the initial NI and NI_DOT values. A time TI for the<br>
sub-phase 1 or a first phase can be calculated through the following equation:<br><br>
wherein KI is a calibration between zero and one describing a desired behavior<br>
of NI. KI can be a variable term, set by indications of the context of<br>
powertrain operation describing required properties of the shift, or K| can be a<br>
fixed calibrated value. Sub-phase 3 describes a transition to the target NI and<br>
NI_DOT values. A time T3 for the sub-phase 3 or a third phase can be calculated<br>
through the following equation:<br><br>
wherein K3 is a calibration between zero and one describing a desired<br>
behavior of NI and can be set by methods similar to KI. Sub-phase 2 describes<br>
a transition between sub-phases 1 and 3. A time T2 or a second phase, as the<br><br>
remaining portion of the total desired speed phase time to be set after TI and<br>
T3 are defined, can be calculated through the following equation:<br><br>
Sub-phase 2 is depicted as a straight line in the exemplary data of FIG. 15. It<br>
will be appreciated that a curved transition can be defined in the sub-phase 2<br>
region depending upon the total desired speed phase time and the behavior of<br>
the exemplary powertrain. However, a straight line as depicted can be<br>
preferable. The slope of the NI curve in sub-phase 2 describes the peak speed<br>
phase input acceleration that must be achieved in order to accomplish the<br>
desired inertia speed phase in the total desired speed phase time. In the<br>
exemplary method where NI_DOT through sub-phase 2 is a constant value, this<br>
peak speed phase input acceleration can be calculated through the following<br>
equations:<br><br><br>
By describing behavior of NI_DOT required through stages of the inertia speed<br>
phase, an input acceleration immediate profile can be defined to operate NI<br>
changes in an inertia speed phase.<br>
[0071] As described above, reaction times in engines to control commands<br>
tend to be slow relative to reaction times of other components of a powertrain.<br>
As a result, engine commands issued to an engine simultaneously to an input<br>
acceleration immediate profile would include a resulting lag in changes to NI.<br>
Instead, a method is additionally disclosed, wherein an input acceleration lead<br>
immediate profile is defined based upon a lead period describing the reaction<br>
time of the engine. Such a lead period can be the same lead period as<br>
calculated in Equation 1 above or can be calculated separately based upon the<br>
specific behavior of the engine in an inertia speed phase. For instance.<br>
because there is no direct implication of electric machine operation in NI_DOT,<br>
the lead period for the input acceleration lead immediate profile can include a<br>
factor for an electric machine helping to change NI_DOT more quickly than the<br>
engine could in isolation. The input acceleration lead immediate profile<br>
depicted in FIG. 7 includes a portion of the lead profile before the start of the<br>
inertia speed phase. In the case of a shift from a fixed gear state, wherein after<br>
a shift is initiated, an unlocking event in an off-going clutch must occur, the<br>
time period during the unlocking event provides a period wherein commands<br>
can be issued to the engine in advance of a desired change in Nj. This lead in<br>
advance of the inertia speed phase is beneficial in maintaining inertia speed<br>
phases to a total desired speed phase time, in accordance with the<br>
determinations described above. In circumstance where no or an insufficient<br>
lead period is available to allow an input acceleration lead immediate profile<br><br><br>
to effect engine changes according to the input acceleration immediate profile,<br>
an adjustment can be made to the inertia speed phase to compensate for the<br>
reaction time of the engine and the resulting lag in changes to N,.<br>
Circumstances where no lead is possible includes a shift starting from an<br>
exemplary EVT mode, wherein only one clutch is initially engaged, and the<br>
inertia speed phase can start immediately upon command. In such a<br>
circumstance, the initiation of the inertia speed phase can be delayed after<br>
commands are issued to the engine in accordance with the determined lead<br>
time.<br>
[0072] FIG. 10 shows a control system architecture for controlling and<br>
managing torque and power flow in a powertrain system having multiple<br>
torque generative devices, described herein below with reference to the hybrid<br>
powertrain system shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, and residing in the aforementioned<br>
control modules in the form of executable algorithms and calibrations. The<br>
control system architecture can be applied to any powertrain system having<br>
multiple torque generative devices, including, e.g., a hybrid powertrain system<br>
having a single electric machine, a hybrid powertrain system having multiple<br>
electric machines, and non-hybrid powertrain systems.<br>
[0073] The control system architecture of FIG. 10 depicts a flow of pertinent<br>
signals through the control modules. In operation, the operator inputs to the<br>
accelerator pedal 113 and the brake pedal 112 are monitored to determine the<br>
operator torque request ('TO_REQ')- Operation of the engine 14 and the<br>
transmission 10 are monitored to determine the input speed ('NI') and the<br>
output speed ('No'). A strategic optimization control scheme ('Strategic<br>
Control') 310 determines a preferred input speed ('NIDES') and a preferred<br><br><br>
engine state and transmission operating range state ('Hybrid Range State Des')<br>
based upon the output speed and the operator torque request, and optimized<br>
based upon other operating parameters of the hybrid powertrain, including<br>
battery power limits and response limits of the engine 14, the transmission 10,<br>
and the first and second electric machines 56 and 72. The strategic<br>
optimization control scheme 310 is preferably executed by the HCP 5 during<br>
each 100 ms loop cycle and each 25 ms loop cycle.<br>
[0074] The outputs of the strategic optimization control scheme 310 are used<br>
in a shift execution and engine start/stop control scheme ('Shift Execution and<br>
Engine Start/Stop') 320 to command changes in the transmission operation<br>
('Transmission Commands') including changing the operating range state.<br>
This includes commanding execution of a change in the operating range state<br>
if the preferred operating range state is different from the present operating<br>
range state by commanding changes in application of one or more of the<br>
clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75 and other transmission commands.<br>
The present operating range state ('Hybrid Range State Actual') and an input<br>
speed profile ('NI_PROF') can be determined. The input speed profile is an<br>
estimate of an upcoming input speed and preferably comprises a scalar<br>
parametric value that is a targeted input speed for the forthcoming loop cycle.<br>
The engine operating commands and the operator torque request are based<br>
upon the input speed profile during a transition in the operating range state of<br>
the transmission.<br>
[0075] A tactical control scheme (Tactical Control and Operation') 330 is<br>
repeatedly executed during one of the control loop cycles to determine engine<br>
commands ('Engine Commands') for operating the engine, including a<br><br><br>
preferred input torque from the engine 34 to the transmission 10 based upon<br>
the output speed, the input speed, and the operator torque request and the<br>
present operating range state for the transmission. The engine commands also<br>
include engine states including one of an all-cylinder operating state and a<br>
cylinder deactivation operating state wherein a portion of the engine cylinders<br>
are deactivated and unfueled, and engine states including one of a fueled state<br>
and a fuel cutoff state.<br>
[0076] A clutch torque (TCL') for each clutch is estimated in the TCM 17,<br>
including the presently applied clutches and the non-applied clutches, and a<br>
present engine input torque ('TV) reacting with the input member 12 is<br>
determined in the ECM 23. A motor torque control scheme ('Output and<br>
Motor Torque Determination7) 340 is executed to determine the preferred<br>
output torque from the powertrain ('TO_CMD'), which includes motor torque<br>
commands ('TA', 'TB') for controlling the first and second electric machines<br>
56 and 72 in this embodiment. The preferred output torque is based upon the<br>
estimated clutch torque(s) for each of the clutches, the present input torque<br>
from the engine 14, the present operating range state, the input speed, the<br>
operator torque request, and the input speed profile. The first and second<br>
electric machines 56 and 72 are controlled through the TPIM 19 to meet the<br>
preferred motor torque commands based upon the preferred output torque.<br>
The motor torque control scheme 340 includes algorithmic code which is<br>
regularly executed during the 6.25 ms and 12.5 ms loop cycles to determine<br>
the preferred motor torque commands.<br>
[0077] FIG. 11 is a schematic diagram exemplifying data flow through a<br>
shift execution, describing more detail exemplary execution of the control<br><br><br>
system architecture such as the system of FIG. 10 in greater detail, in<br>
accordance with the present disclosure. Powertrain control system 400 is<br>
illustrated comprising several hybrid drive components, including an engine<br>
410, an electric machine 420, and clutch hydraulics 430. Control modules<br>
strategic control module 310, shift execution module 450, clutch capacity<br>
control module 460, tactical control and operation module 330, output and<br>
motor torque determination module 340, and clutch control module 490, are<br>
illustrated, processing information and issuing control commands to engine<br>
410, electric machine 420, and clutch hydraulics 430. These control modules<br>
can be physically separate, can be grouped together in a number of different<br>
control devices, or can be entirely performed within a single physical control<br>
device. Module 310, a strategic control module, performs determinations<br>
regarding preferred powertrain operating points and preferred operating range<br>
states as described in FIG. 10. Module 450, a shift execution module,<br>
receives input from strategic control module 310 and other sources regarding<br>
shift initiation. Module 450 processes inputs regarding the reactive torque<br>
currently applied to the clutch and the preferred operating range state to be<br>
transitioned to. Module 450 then employs an algorithm, determining<br>
parameters for the execution of the shift, including hybrid range state<br>
parameters describing the balance of input torques required of the torque<br>
providing devices, details regarding a target input speed and input acceleration<br>
lead predicted required to execute the transition to the preferred operating<br>
range state, an input acceleration lead immediate as previously described, and<br>
clutch reactive torque lead immediate min/max and clutch reactive torque<br>
immediate min/max values as previously described. From module 450, clutch<br><br><br>
reactive torque parameters and hybrid range state information are fed to clutch<br>
capacity control module 460, lead control parameters and signals are fed to<br>
tactical control and operation module 330, and immediate control parameters<br>
and signals are fed to output and motor torque determination module 340.<br>
Clutch capacity control module 460 processes reactive torque and hybrid<br>
range state information and generates logic describing clutch reactive torque<br>
limits enabling engine control through module 330, electric machine control<br>
through module 340, and clutch control through module 490, in accordance<br>
with methods described herein. Tactical control and operation module 330<br>
includes means to issue torque requests and execute limits upon input torque<br>
supplied from engine 410, and feed, additionally, describe the input torque<br>
supplied from the engine to module 340 for use in control of electric machine<br>
420. Output and motor torque determination module 340 likewise receives<br>
and processes information to issue electric machine torque requests to electric<br>
machine 420. Additionally, module 340 generates clutch reactive torque<br>
commands for use by clutch control module 490. Module 490 processes<br>
information from module 340 and issues hydraulic commands in order to<br>
achieve the required clutch torque capacity required to operate the<br>
transmission. This particular embodiment of data flow illustrates one possible<br>
exemplary process by which a vehicular torque generative devices and related<br>
clutches can be controlled in accordance with the method disclosed herein. It<br>
will be appreciated by one having ordinary skill in the art that the particular<br>
process employed can vary, and this disclosure is not intended to limited to the<br>
particular exemplary embodiment described herein.<br><br>
[0078] When a powertrain is operated in a fixed gear operating range state,<br>
NI is a function of No- Under this fixed relationship, no active control of NI<br>
independent of No is possible. Under a variable relationship of NI to NO, for<br>
example in a transmission operating range state wherein NI and No can be<br>
controlled independently, such as is described in relation to EVT Mode 1 and<br>
Mode II above, NI can vary compared to a fixed No profile. Operation in EVT<br>
modes can be in either transient or stable. Transient EVT mode operation<br>
occurs when a synchronous shift is performed, for example, in an inertia speed<br>
phase, as described above, in order to transition NI from an initial speed to a<br>
target speed for the purpose of facilitating a synchronous shift. Stable EVT<br>
mode operation occurs with the powertrain operating at or tracking to a<br>
calibrated optimal mode input speed. Priorities within the operation of the<br>
powertrain through these EVT modes depend upon whether the operation is<br>
transient or stable.<br>
[0079] As described above, maintaining a stable To and tracking TO-REQ are<br>
important to drivability. Interruptions or instabilities in To result in jerky<br>
operation of the powertrain. Failures to closely track TO_REQ results in poor<br>
powertrain performance. Also as described above, control of NI_DOT is<br>
important to orderly and efficient transmission shifts. Additionally, as NI is<br>
directly related to engine speed, control of NI_DOT impacts drivability,<br>
protection of components sensitive to NI, and satisfaction of the operator.<br>
While control of To and NI_DOT are sometimes compatible, depending upon<br>
powertrain operation, control of these two properties can be in competition.<br>
To and NI_DOT can be related to powertrain operation through the following<br>
equation:<br><br><br><br>
TI_ACT is a determined actual TI based upon engine operation. A method is<br>
disclosed to prioritize between To and NI_DOT based upon powertrain<br>
operation.<br>
[0080] While operating in a transient EVT mode, an input acceleration<br>
profile is generated in order to control the engine to a target speed within a<br>
given desired shift time. Input acceleration can be prioritized, emphasizing<br>
tracking an input speed profile through the shift event, while still protecting<br>
powertrain performance by defining ranges of To values through the shift and<br>
defining an input acceleration profile based upon the ranges of To values.<br>
[0081] FIG. 12 is a schematic diagram exemplifying data flow through a<br>
control system, determining an input acceleration profile through a transient<br>
EVT mode, in accordance with the present disclosure. Information flow 451<br>
comprises a shift execution module 450, output and motor torque<br>
determination module 340, engine 410, and electric machine 420. Inputs<br>
regarding input and output torques are monitored by shift execution module<br>
450, and an input acceleration immediate profile is determined in order to<br>
execute a transmission shift. Output and motor torque determination module<br>
340 receives the input acceleration profile as an input, and along with input<br>
regarding TI_ACT and TO_REQ, issues control commands to electric machine 420.<br>
Additionally, module 340 provides a determined output torque ('TO_REQ').<br><br><br>
Shift execution module 450 comprises an output torque prioritization module<br>
452, an input acceleration limits module 454, and an in put speed profiling<br>
module 456. TOREQ is input to shift execution module 450, and TI_ACT and<br>
TO_CALC are fed back within information flow 451 to shift execution module<br>
450. Output torque prioritization module 452 monitors TQ_REQ and TO_CALC<br>
and outputs ranges of To values in the form of a maximum desired output<br>
torque and a minimum desired output torque. These minimum and maximum<br>
desired output torques and TI_ACT are monitored by input acceleration limits<br>
module 454, and minimum and maximum input accelerations are determined.<br>
These minimum and maximum input accelerations are input to input speed<br>
profiling module 456, and the input acceleration immediate profile is<br>
developed based upon the minimum and maximum input accelerations. In this<br>
way, a range of To values can be defined and utilized to constrain an input<br>
acceleration profile.<br>
[0082] The exemplary information flow of FIG. 12 describes TO_REQ and<br>
TO_CALC being used as inputs to output torque prioritization module 452 in<br>
order to develop minimum and maximum desired output torques. FIG. 13<br>
graphically illustrates an exemplary method in a transient EVT mode to<br>
determine minimum and maximum desired output torques based upon TO_REQ<br>
and TO_CALC, in accordance with the present disclosure. TO_REQ is depicted,<br>
including an initially positive value transitioning to a smaller magnitude,<br>
negative value. To_CALC, describing a determined actual output torque<br>
generated by the powertrain, is also depicted, describing T0 through the<br>
depicted time span. Minimum and maximum desired output torque values,<br>
according to this exemplary method, are defined according to the maximum of<br><br><br>
TO_REQ, TOCALC, and zero and the minimum of TO_REQ, TO_CALC, and zero.<br>
The method also includes permissible inclusion of a calibratable reserve in<br>
torque added to both the minimum and maximum values. The range of output<br>
torque values, for a transient EVT mode, can therefore be expressed by the<br>
following equations:<br><br>
[0083] Based upon an range of output torque values, as expressed by the<br>
minimum and maximum desired output torques, constraints upon input<br>
acceleration can be determined based upon the relationship between NI_DOT<br>
and To, expressed for example in Equation 8. These constraints upon input<br>
acceleration based upon minimum and maximum desired output torques can<br>
define boundaries, within which input acceleration can be controlled without<br>
causing To to violate the minimum and maximum desired output torques.<br>
FIG. 14 graphically illustrates an exemplary application of minimum and<br>
maximum input acceleration values upon an input acceleration profile, in<br>
accordance with the present disclosure. FIG. 14 includes a top portion<br>
describing input speed and a bottom portion describing input acceleration<br>
against a common timescale. A shift is initiated from one fixed gear state to<br>
another. As described above, an inertia speed phase including transient<br>
operation in an EVT mode is utilized to change input speed from an initial<br><br>
input speed defined by a initial fixed gear ratio to a target input speed defined<br>
by a destination fixed gear ratio and a shift time. An input acceleration<br>
immediate profile is developed in order to create the necessary transition in<br>
input speeds. Minimum and maximum input acceleration profiles are depicted<br>
in the bottom portion of the graph describing constraints upon input<br>
acceleration imposed according to methods described herein. When the<br>
constraints, such as the minimum input acceleration profile in the exemplary<br>
graph, interact with the intended input acceleration immediate profile, the<br>
input acceleration immediate is modified according to the constraint. As<br>
depicted in the top portion of the graph, this change to input acceleration<br>
changes the normal "S-shaped" input speed profile, causing a delay in changes<br>
to input speed. As a result, based upon a changing target speed caused by<br>
changes in No as the shift time increases, the input acceleration immediate<br>
profile must be adjusted to compensate. The shift time, in particular the flat<br>
portion of the input acceleration profile associated with time T2 described<br>
above, is extended such that the transition to the new target speed can be<br>
recovered. In this way, constraints upon input acceleration based upon<br>
minimum and maximum desired output torques can be imposed, allowing a<br>
prioritized input acceleration profile to be enacted while protecting a certain<br>
range of To values through the shift.<br>
[0084] By contrast, while the powertrain operates in a stable EVT mode<br>
according to an exemplary control method, NI is preferably maintained at or<br>
tracked to an optimal input speed. However, operating in a stable EVT mode<br>
condition, delivering To based upon To REQ can be prioritized within<br>
reasonable limits over maintaining NI at the optimal input speed. The<br><br><br>
exemplary information flow of FIG. 12 can be utilized in a stable EVT mode<br>
to utilize ranges of To values to determine an input acceleration profile. The<br>
process differs in a stable EVT mode from a transient EVT mode in the<br>
defining of the range in To values in the information flow, for example, the<br>
processing occurring within exemplary module 452. Described above, an<br>
range of To values for a transient EVT mode is described including minimum<br>
and maximum desired output torque values including To REQ, TO_CALC and<br>
zero as likely defining boundaries to the range. This wide range of To values<br>
results in a wide range of input acceleration values fitting between resulting<br>
minimum and maximum input acceleration values. For a stable EVT mode, a<br>
range of To values is instead described including minimum and maximum<br>
desired output torque values based upon only TO_REQ and TO_CALC. The space<br>
between TO_REQ and TO_CALC and a calibratable reserve above and below the<br>
range set by TO_REQ and TO_CALC, for example, can define a range of T0 values<br>
for use in setting input acceleration constraints. This resulting narrower band<br>
of To values, in comparison to the range defined for a transient EVT mode<br>
wherein a zero torque level is included, results in more narrow resulting<br>
minimum and maximum input acceleration values. While input speed and<br>
input accelerations in a stable EVT mode remain configured to the calibrated<br>
optimal input speed for the EVT mode, interaction with the minimum and<br>
maximum input accelerations can move input speed away from the optimal<br>
input speed in order to prioritize T0. As mentioned above, NI and NI_DOT can<br>
vary from the optimal input speed in this way in order to prioritize T0, but a<br>
measure of reasonable deviation for NI can be enforced. For example, a band<br>
of allowable input speeds above and below the optimal input speed can be<br><br><br>
adopted. In the alternative, a minimum and maximum input speed in the EVT<br>
mode can be enforced based upon preferential operation in that EVT mode.<br>
Additionally, static minimum and maximum input acceleration limits can be<br>
defined to describe how much input acceleration can change based upon To,<br>
limiting how much input speed and input acceleration can be sacrificed in<br>
order to prioritize To.<br>
[0085] The above described exemplary method to define a range of T0<br>
values for use in a stable EVT mode defines a band based upon TO_REQ and<br>
TO_CALC- However, one having ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that To<br>
in a driving condition changes with foot pedal position. Greater depression of<br>
foot pedal position describes a greater expectation for changes in powertrain<br>
operation. As a result, greater range of input acceleration terms can<br>
foreseeably be required to support the greater expectation for changes in<br>
powertrain operation. A wider range of To values in response to foot pedal<br>
position generating a wider range of allowable input acceleration values<br>
between the minimum and maximum input accelerations can be beneficial.<br>
Such a result can be achieved by widening the range of To values based upon<br>
foot pedal position. This widening can be accomplished, for example, by<br>
modulating or expanding TO_CALC away from TO_REQ based upon foot pedal<br>
position. Additionally, widening of the range of To values can be<br>
accomplished by expanding the calibrated reserves added to the range set by<br>
TO_REQ and TO_CALC. The minimum and maximum desired output torque<br>
values for a stable EVT mode, including terms to widen the resulting range<br>
according to foot pedal position, can be expressed by the following equations:<br><br><br>
Calibratable Scalar =/Foot Pedal Position)	[ 13 J<br>
Calibratable Reserve =/Foot Pedal Position)	f 14]<br>
[0086] FIG. 15 graphically depicts an exemplary method to determine<br>
minimum and maximum desired output torques in a stable EVT mode based<br>
upon TOREQ and TOCALC, including widening the resulting range between<br>
TO_REQ and To CALC according to foot pedal position, in accordance with the<br>
present disclosure. The graph includes a top portion, depicting torque terms,<br>
and a bottom portion, depicting accelerator pedal position, depicted against a<br>
common timeline. TO_REQ and TO_CALC are depicted illustrating torque<br>
requested through the timeline and resulting output torque. As described<br>
above, a range of To values is defined including the range between TO_REQ and<br>
TO_CALC and calibratable reserves above and below TO_REQ and TO_CALC • When<br>
the pedal position is at zero, the resulting range of To values defined by TO_REQ<br>
and TO_CALC and the calibratable reserves is unaffected. However, as the<br>
accelerator pedal is depressed, both TO_CALC and the calibratable reserves are<br>
modulated to widen the range of To values. Resulting minimum and<br>
maximum input acceleration values will correspondingly include a greater<br><br>
range of input acceleration values therebetween. In this way, a widening of a<br>
range of To values based on foot pedal position and utilized to define input<br>
acceleration constraints can be determined.<br>
