DESCRIPTION FLAKY PIGMENTS<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a flaky pigment excellent in leafing properties and adhesion and in particular to a flaky pigment for coating and printing ink, which is coated with a coupling agent and an organic compound having a perfluoroalkyl group and is excellent in leafing properties and adhesion between flaky pigment particles and a coating layer.<br>
Background Art<br>
Heretofore, a large number pearlescent pigments and metal pigments having the shape of leaf, when incorporated into coating compositions etc., form coatings of design based on brightness by uniformly dispersing flaky pigment particles in coating layers. Recently, the development of various flaky pigments of design having brightness like plating is advanced by allowing flaky pigment particles represented by leafing aluminum flake pigment to float on the surface of a coating {leafing properties or plane orientation) to further improve the brightness of the coating. For example, with respect to metal pigments, a pigment comprising flake copper powder coated with stearic acid (JP-A 8-188731) and a pigment comprising aluminum flakes whose surface has been treated with alkyl<br><br>
WO 02/064682	PCT/EP01/01C82<br>
phosphates (JP-A 11-57605) have been pro osed as pigments having leafing properties.<br>
Further, with respect to pearlescent pigments, a resin film comprising pearlescent pigments coated with a silane compound has been proposed (JP-A 7-62151). This silane coating pigment was used to raise leafing properties and compatibility between pigment particles and resin in the^resin film.<br>
Among these known flaky pigments, there are pigments showing excellent characteristics in leafing properties, but the interlaminar adhesion between the pigment particles and the coated film is weak, and accordingly, there is a defect in durability when used as coatings. That is, even if the known flaky pigment particles float on the surface of the coating to achieve a desired design by brightness based on their leafing properties, the interlaminar adhesion between the flaky pigment particles and a clear coating coated thereon for the purpose of protection is so low that the clear coating is easily removed upon attaching and pulling a cellophane tape or the like. Thus, such pigments used in a coating fail to achieve durability required of the coating.<br>
On one hand, it is also attempted that the adhesion between pigment particles and a clear coating layer is raised without reducing leafing properties by devising a coating technique in which just before coating, an organic solvent-type base<br><br>
WO 02/064682	PCT/EI)(n/01(iS2<br>
coating containing a resin compos: -ion for coating is mixed with a dispersion of leafing aluminum flake pigments in an organic solvent (JP-A 11-128828).<br>
On the other hand, pigments treated with phosphate compounds having perfluoroalkyl groups (JP-A-5-i93153) or with silane compounds (JP-A 2,-218603) or pigments treated simultaneously with these compounds having jierfluoroalkyl groups and reactive organic silicon compounds (JP-A 8-217 989) are also proposed, but both of the pigments are developed for the purpose of improving the water- and oil-repellency of the pigments, and these are pigments used mainly for cosmetics.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
As a result of their eager study for developing a flaky pigment for coating or printing ink which is excellent in leafing properties and inter laminar adhesion between pigment particles and a protective coating, the present inventors found that a flaky pigment treated by coating the pigment with a coupling agent and a compound having a perfluoroalkyl group improves both leafing properties and interlaminar adhesion, and that it is excellent particularly as a pigment for coating and printing ink of which durability is required.<br>
That is, the present invention provides a novel flaky pigment for resin composition described in items 1 to 6 below, which is excellent in leafing properties and interlaminar<br><br>

Best Mode Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Hereinafter, the embodiments of the flaky pigment for resin composition according to the present invention are described item by item in more detail. 1) The flaky pigment<br>
Although the flaky pigment used in the flaky pigment for resin composition according to the present invention is not particularly limited, the present invention is directed in particular to flaky pearlescent pigments and metal pigments used for coating or printing ink. Here, the pearlescent pigments and metal pigments are classified according to the different concepts of function and material, so it should be noted that the same pigment or base material may fall under both the concepts.<br>
The pearlescent pigments include single or complex metal oxide-coated mica based on flaky mica (natural and synthetic mica), for example, various kinds of titanium oxide-coated mica, iron oxide-coated mica, mica coated with a metal complex oxide consisting of titanium and an acid, and cobalt titanate-coated mica; metal oxide-coated graphite flakes based on flaky graphite, for example, titanium dioxide-coated graphite flakes; and various kinds of metal oxide-coated alumina flakes<br><br>

3) The coupling agent<br>
The coupling agent used in the present invention is not<br>
particularly limited, and it is possible to use a silane-based<br>
coupling agent,  a titanium-based coupling agent and a<br>
zirconium-based coupling agent, and the silane coupling agent<br>
is particularly preferable from an economical point of view.<br>
Typical compounds of each coupling agent are as follows:<br>
A) Silane-based coupling agent<br>
Methacryloxy alkoxypropyl trimethoxysilane,<br>
Y-(2-aminoethyl)aminopropyl trimethoxys ilane,<br>
Y-(2-aminoethyl)aminopropylmethy1 dimethoxys ilane,<br>
Y-methacryloxypropyl trimethoxysilane,<br>
N-fJ- (N-vinylbenzylaminoethyl) -Y-aminopropyl<br><br>
WO 02/064682	PCT/EP0I/0I682<br>
10<br>
trimethoxysilane,<br>
Y-glycidoxypropyl  trimethoxysilane, Y-mercaptopropyl trimethoxysilane, vinyl triacetoxysilane,<br>
Y-chloropropyl trimethoxysilane,<br>
octadecyldimethyl[3-(trimethoxys ilyl)propyl]ammonium chloride,<br>
Y-mercaptopropylmethyl dimethoxycine, methyl trichlorosilane, dimethyl dichlorosilane,<br>
trimethyl chlorosilane,   and vinyl trimethoxysilane.<br>
In	particular,	Y~
trimethoxysilane, Y-methacryloxypropyl trimethoxysilane, and Y-glycidoxypropyl  trimethoxysilane are preferable.<br>
B)	Titanium-based coupling agent<br>
Tetra(2,2-diallyloxymethyl-l-butyl)bis(di-tridecyl) phosphite)   titanate,<br>
bis(dioctylpyrophosphate)  oxyacetate  titanate,   and isopropyltri(N-aminoester-aminoethyl)   titanate.<br>
C)	Zircoaluminate-based coupling agent<br>
Carboxyzircoaluminate and methacryloxyzircoaluminate. 4) Coverage amount<br>
The coverage amount of each of the coupling agent and the<br><br>
WO 02/064682	PCT/EP01/01682<br>
n<br>
compounds having a perfluoroalkyl group represented by the general formulae (I) to (III) above may be the same and is 0.05 to 20 % by weight, preferably 0.05 to 15 % by weight, relative to the flaky pigment.<br>
If the coverage amount of each of these components is less than 0.05 % by weight, it is not possible to achieve suf fici*3t leafing effects and adhesion to a coating layer.<br>
On the other hand, a coverage amount exceeding 20 % by weight, although the desired leafing effects etc. can thereby be achieved, is meaningless from an economical point of view because no further improvement of the effects can be expected. 5) Process<br>
Either a wet process or a dry process used in a conventional process for pigments can be used as the process for producing the flaky pigment for resin composition according to the present invention. However, because pigments having even characteristics can be obtained easily and effectively and subsidiary materials can be easily handled, the wet process in an aqueous system is most appropriate as the process for producing the flaky pigment according to the present invention.<br>
One example of the process by the wet process is outlined as follows. A flaky pigment is suspended in a water solvent, and first a coupling agent is added or its solution is added dropwise to the suspension. Then, a phosphate having a perfluoroalkyl group or a silane compound is added or its<br><br>
WO 02/064682	PCT/EPOl/01682<br>
12<br>
solution is added dropwise thereto. During these coating treatments, the solution is adjusted to pH and temperature which are suitable for each material to be handled, and each material is stirred so that the pigment is uniformly coated therewith. After the coating treatments/ the pigment is filtered, washed with water and dried in a usual manner to give the desired pigment.<br>
With respect to the order of addition of the coupling agent and the compound having a perfluoroalkyl group, it is preferable to first coat the pigment with the coupling agent as outlined above because the pigment with even characteristics can be easily obtained. However, it is also possible to add both the compounds simultaneously or as a mixture. 6) Use of the flaky pigment as a pigment for resin composition<br>
As described above, the flaky pigment of the present invention is an material exhibiting its effects upon incorporation into a coating composition in an organic solvent system, a coating composition in an aqueous system and a composition, typically printing ink etc. containing resin as an component. Accordingly, the flaky pigment of the present invention can be used as a pigment added to coatings applied to various materials such as paper, wood plates, metal plates, cloth, leather and plastics and to a composition such as printing ink containing resin.<br><br>

Comparative Example 4<br>
Using 100 g of the same iron oxide-coated mica flakes (IRIODIN 504 Red, a product of E. Merck) having a particle size of 10 to 60 jim exhibiting a wine red reflection color as in Example 3, a pigment was obtained in the same manner using the same amounts of the same materials as in Example 3 except that the Y-methacryloxypropyl trimethoxysilane was not used. Test Examples<br>
The pigments obtained in the Examples and the Comparative Examples were examined in each of the following tests using test methods described below. The results of each test are collectively shown in Table 1. 1) Water resistance test (hot-water immersion test)<br>
A thermosetting acrylic melamine resin (a mixture of Acrydic 47-712 and Super Beccamin G821-60 at a ratio of 7 : 3 by weight, Dainippon Ink and Chemicals, Inc.) was mixed at a concentration of 10 % by weight was applied at a dry film thickness of about 15 ^m on a zinc phosphate-treated steel plate (7 cmxl5 cm) having been coated with black enamel at a dry film thickness of about 20 \m and baked at 160 °C for 20 minutes, and the plate was left for 5 minutes and coated by air spraying with 7 weight-% dispersion of the resulting pigment in xylene,<br>
left for 10 minutes and cured by heating at 140 °C for 30 minutes. The cured coated face was coated with a top clear coating of a thermosetting acrylic melamine resin (a mixture of Acrydic<br><br>
WO 02/064682	PCT/EP01/0I682<br>
19<br>
47-179 and Super Beccamin L117-60 at a ratio of 7 : 3 by weight, Dainippon Ink and Chemicals, Inc.) at a dry film thickness of about 30 mn, left for 10 minutes and cured by heating at 140 °c for 30 minutes.<br>
The test plate produced in the method described above was<br>
immersed in hot water at 80 °C and kept therein for 8 hours, and then the temperature of hot water was decreased to room temperature, and the test plate was removed and visually checked to examine the change of its appearance.<br>
Numerical values in Table 1 indicate that whitening/shrinkage performance is" inferior in the order of from 1C to 1.<br>
2)	Adhesion<br>
The coated face of the test plate prepared in the water resistance test was cut such that the cut reached the base<br>
material whereby 100 cut-line squares with a size of 1 mmxl mm were made thereon, and a cellophane tape was attached to the surface and rapidly peeled off, and then the coated face was observed.<br>
O indicates that 9 or less squares were removed, and x indicates that 10 or more squares were removed.<br>
3)	Hue measurement (chromatic value)<br>
C-value (chromatic value) was measured at an angle of<br>
incidence of 25° and at a light-receiving angle of 20° with a varied-angle color measurement meter GCMS3 (Murakami Shikisai<br><br>
WO 02/064682<br><br>
20<br><br>
PCT/EP01/01682<br><br>
Co., Ltd.)- The C value is indica       the intensity of<br>
reflection color of the pearlescent pigment, and a large C value<br>
indicates stronger color.  This is correlated with the<br>
denseness of particles due to the leafing effects of the<br>
pigment.<br>
4) Designing ability<br>
The coating was visually evaluated.  In Table 1, O indicates a designing ability excellent in plating-like<br>
brightness, and x indicates the designing ability of a usual pearlescent pigment. Table 1<br><br>

Industrial Applicability<br>
It was found in the present invention that a novel flaky pigment having the leafing effects of flaky pigment particles on a coating and being excellent in the interlaminar adhesion<br><br>
WO 02/064682	PCT/EP01/01682<br>
21<br>
between flaky pigment particles and a coated film is obtained by coating the surface of a flaky pigment with a combination of a coupling agent and an organic compound having a perfluoroalkyl group. By having such properties, the flaky pigment particles are orientated densely on the coating, thus reinforcing plating-like brightness and effectively exhibiting the pearlescence of particularly a pearlescent pigment. Further, the effect of improving the interlaminar adhesion prevents the exfoliation of a clear coating thereby achieving lasting brightness and improving the durability of a coating or printing ink.<br><br>
