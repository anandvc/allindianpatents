				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION <br>
This invention relates to a highly conserved,<br>
immunologically accessible antigen at the surface of<br>
Neissezria meningitidis organisms. This unique antigen<br>
provides the basis for new immunotherapeutic, prophylactic<br>
and diagnostic agents useful in the treatment, prevention<br>
and diagnosis of Neisseria meningitidis diseases. More<br>
particularly, this invention relates to a proteinase K<br>
resistant Neisseria meningitidis surface protein having an<br>
apparent molecular weight of 22 kDa, the corresponding<br>
nuclecrtide and derived amino acid sequences (SBQ ID NO:1<br>
to SEQ ID N0:26J,, recoitibinant DNA methods for the<br>
production of the Neisseria. msniri&amp;itidis 22 kDa surface<br>
protein, antibodies that bind to the Neisseria<br>
meningitidis 22 kDa surface protein and methods and<br>
compositions for the diagnosis,, treatment and prevention<br>
of Neisseria meningitidis diseases. This application is divided<br>
out of Indian Patent Application No.466/CAL/96.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Neisseria. meningitidis is a major cause of death and<br>
mariidity -throughout the world. Neisseria meningitidis<br>
causes both endemic and epidemic diseases, principally<br>
meningitis and meningococcemia [Gold, Evolution -of<br>
meningococcal disease, p. 69, Vedros N.A., CRC Press<br>
(1987); Schwartz et al, Clin. Microbiol. Rev., 2, p. S118<br>
(1989)]. In fact, this organism is one of the most common<br>
causes, after Haemophilus influenzae type b, of bacterial<br>
meningitis in the United States, accounting for<br>
approximately 20% of all cases. It has been well<br>
documented that serum bactericidal activity is the major<br>
defense mechanism against Neisseria meningitidis and that<br>
protection against invasion by the bacteria correlates<br>
with the presence in the serum of anti-meningococcal<br>
antibodies [Goldschneider et al., J. Exp. Med. 129,<br>
p. 1307 {1369)} Goldschneider et al., J. Exp. Med., 129,<br>
p. 1327 (1969)].<br>
Neisseria meningitidis are subdivided into<br>
serological groups according to the presence of capsular<br>
antigens. Currently, 12 serogroups are recognized, but<br>
serogroups A, B, C, Y, and W-135 are most commonly found.<br>
Within serogroups, serotypes, subtypes and immunotypes<br>
can be identified on outer membrane proteins and<br>
lipopolysaccharode [Frasch et al. , Rev. Infect. Dis. 7,<br>
p. 504 (1985)].<br>
The capsular polysaccharide vaccines presently<br>
available are not effective against all Neisaeria.<br>
meningitidis isolates -and do not effectively induce the<br>
production of protective antibodies in young infants<br>
[Frasch, Microbiol. Rev, 2, p, S134 (1989); Reingold<br>
et al., Lancet, p. 114 (1985); Zollinger, in Woodrow and<br>
Levine, New generation vaccines, p. 325, Marcel Dekker<br>
Inc. N.Y. (1990)]. The capsulax polysaccharide of<br>
serogroups A, C, Y and W-135 are presently used in<br>
vaccines -against this organism, These polysaccharide<br>
vaccines are effective in the short term, however the<br>
vaccinated subjects do not-develop--an iasaunological<br>
memory, so they must be revaccinated within a three-year<br>
period to maintain their level of resistance.<br>
further, these polysaccharide vaccines do not<br>
induce sufficient levels of bactericidal antibodies to<br>
obtain the desired protection in children under two years<br>
of age, whoare the principal victims of this disease, No<br>
effective vaccine against serogroup B isolates is<br>
presently available even though these organisms are one of<br>
the primary causes of meningococcal diseases in developed<br>
countries. Indeed, the serogroup B polysaccharide is not<br>
a good immunogen, inducing only a poor response of. IgM of<br>
low specificity which is not protective [Gotschlicli<br>
et al., J. Infect. Pis., 149, p. 387 (1984); Zollinger et<br>
al., J. Clin. Invest, 63, p. 836 (1979)], Furthermore,<br>
the presence of closely similar, crossreactive structures<br>
in the glycoproteins of neonatal human brain tissue [Finite<br>
et al., Lancet, p. 355 (1983)] might discourage attempts<br>
at improving the immunogenicity of serogroup B<br>
polysacharide.<br>
To obtain a more effective vaccine, other Neisserie.<br>
meningitidis surface antigens such as lipopolysaccharide,<br>
pili proteins and proteins present in the outer membrane<br>
are under investigation. The presence of a human immune<br>
response and bactericidal antibodies against certain oÂ£<br>
these proteinaceous surface antigens in the sera, of<br>
immunized voluteers and cunvalescent patient a was<br>
demonstrated [Mandrell and Zollinger/ Infect. Immun., 57,<br>
p. 1590 (1989); Poolman et al., infect. Immun,, 40, p. 398<br>
(1933) ; Rosenquist et al., J, Clin, Microbiol. 7 26,<br>
p. 1543 (1988); Wedege and Froholm Inffect. Immun. 51,<br>
p. 571 (1986); Wedege and Michaglsen, J Clin -Microbiol, ,<br>
25, p. 1349 (1987)].<br>
Furthermore, monoclonal antibodies directed against<br>
jouter membrane proteins, such as class 1, 2/3 -and 5, were<br>
also reported to be bactericidal and to protect against<br>
experimental infections in animals [Brodeur et a1., Infec.<br>
Imrman., 50, p 510 (1985-); frasch et al, Clin, Invest.<br>
Med,, 9, p. 101 (1986); Saukkonen et al. Microb.<br>
Pathogen. , 3, p. 261 (1987); -Saukkonen et al., Vaccine, 7,<br>
p. 325 (1989)].<br>
Antigen preparations based on Neisseria meningitidis<br>
outer membrane proteins have demonstrated immunogenic<br>
effects in animals and in humans and some of them have<br>
been tested in clinical trials [Bjune et al, , Lancet,<br>
p. 1093 (1991),. Costa et al., NIPH.Annals. 14, p. 215<br>
(1991); Frasch et al., Med. Trop, 43, p. 177 (1982);<br>
Frasch et al., Eur. J. Clin. Microbiol.. 4, p. 533 (1985);<br>
Fraach et al. in Robbing, Bacterial Vaccines, p. 262,<br>
Praeger Publications, N.Y. (1987); frasch net -al, J<br>
Infect Dis., 158, p. 710 (1988); Moreno et al. mfec.<br>
Immun., 47, p. 527 (1985); Rosenqvist et al., J. Clin.<br>
Microblol,, 26, p, 1543 (1988); Sierra et al., NIPH<br>
Annals, 14, p. 195 (1991); wedege and Froholm, Infec.<br>
Immun, 51, p. 571 (1986); Wedege and Michaelsen, J. Clin.<br>
Microbiol., 25, p. 1349 (1987); Zollinger et al., J. Clin.<br>
Invest.. 63. p. 836 11979); Zollinger et al., HIPH Annals,<br>
14, p. 211 (1991)}, However the existence of great<br>
interstrain antigenic variability in the outer membrane<br>
proteins can limit their use in vaccines [Frasch, Clin.<br>
Microbe.,Rev. 2, p. S134 (1989)]- Indeed, most-of these<br>
preparations induced bactericidal antibodies that were<br>
restricted to the same or related serotype from which the<br>
antigen was extracted [Zollinger in Woodrow and Levine,<br>
New Generation Vaccines, p. 325, Marcel Dekker Inc. N.Y.<br>
(1990)]. Furthermore, the protection conferred by these<br>
vaccines in young children has yet to be clearly<br>
established. The highly conserved Neisseria meningitidis<br>
outer membrane proteins such as the class A [Munkley<br>
et al. Microb. Pathogen., 11, p. 447 (1991)] and the lip<br>
protein (also called K.8) [Woods et al., Infect. Immun.,<br>
55, p. 1927 (1987)] are not interesting vaccine candidates<br>
since they do not elicit the production of bactericidal<br>
antibodies. To improve these vaccine preparations, there<br>
is a need for highly conserved proteins that would be<br>
present at the surface of all Neisseria meningitidis<br>
Strains and that would be capable of eliciting<br>
bactericidal antibodies in order to develop -a inroad<br>
spectrum vaccine.<br>
The current laboratory diagnosis of Neisseria<br>
meningitidis is usually -done by techniques such as Gram<br>
stain of smear preparations, latex agglutination or<br>
coagglutination, and the culture and isolation on enriched<br>
and selective media [Morello et al., in Balows, Manual of<br>
Clinical Microbiology, p. 258, American Society for<br>
Microbiology, weshington (1991)]. Carbohydrate<br>
degradation tests are usually perforated to confirm the<br>
identification of Neisseria mening-itidis isolates. Most<br>
of the described procedures are time-consuming processes<br>
requiring trained personnel, commerecial agglitination or<br>
coagglutination kits containing polyvalent sera directed<br>
against the capsular antigens expressed by the most<br>
prevalent serogroups are used for the rapid identification<br>
of Neisseria meningitidis However, these polyvalent sera<br>
often nonspecifically cross react with other bacterial<br>
species and for that reason should always be used in<br>
conjunction wiÂ±h Gram stain and culture. Accordingly,<br>
there is a need for efficient alternatives to these<br>
diagnostic assays that will improve the rapidity and<br>
reliability of the diagnosis .<br>

DHTAILSD DBSCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
During our study of the ultrastructure of the outer<br>
membrane of Nsisseria meningitidis we identified a new low<br>
molecular weight protein of 22 kiiodaltons which has very<br>
unique properties. This outer membrane protein is highly<br>
resistant to extensive treatments with proteolytic<br>
enzymes, such as proteinase K, a serine protease derived<br>
from the mold Tritirachiwn album limber. This is very<br>
surprising since proteinase K resistant proteins are very<br>
rare in nature because of the potency, wide pH optimum,<br>
and'low peptide bond specificity of this enzyme [Barrett,<br>
A.J. and N.D. Rawlings, Biochem. Soc, Transactions (1991)<br>
19: 707-715]. Only a few reports have described proteins<br>
of prokaryotic origin that are resistant to the enzymatic<br>
degradation oÂ£ proteinase K. Proteinase K resistant<br>
proteins have been found in Leptospira species [Nicholson,<br>
V.M. -and J.F. Prescott, Veterinary Microbiol. (1993)<br>
36:123-138], Mycoplasma. species [Butler, G.H. et al.<br>
Infec. Immun. (.1991) 59:1037-1042], Spiroplasma mirum<br>
[Bastian, F.O. et al. J. Clin. Microbiol. (1987) 25:2430-<br>
2431] and in viruses and prions [Oncdera, t. et al.<br>
Microbiol. Immunol. (1993) 37:311-316; Prusiner, S,B.<br>
et al. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sea. USA (1593) 90:2793-2797].<br>
Herein, we describe the use of this protein as a means for<br>
the improved prevention, treatment and diagnosis of<br>
Neisseria meningitidis infections.<br>
Thus according to one aspect of the invention we<br>
provide a highly conserved, immunologically accessible<br>
Neisseria meningitxdis -surface protein7 and fragments,<br>
analogues, and derivatives thereof. As used herein,<br>
"Neisaeria meningitidis surface protein" means any<br>
' <br>
naturally occurring Neisseria meningitidis gene. The<br>
Neisseria meningitidis pxotein according to the invention<br>
may be of natural origin, or may be obtained through the<br>
application of molecular biology with the object of<br>
producing a recombinant protein, or fragment thereof.<br>
As used herein, highly conserved" means that the<br>
gene for the Neisseria meningitidis surface protein and<br>
the protein itself exist in greater than 50% of known<br>
strains of Neisseria meningitiais. Preferably/ the gene<br>
and its protein exist in greater than 99% of known strains<br>
of Neisseria meningitidis. Examples 2 and 4 set forth<br>
methods by which one of skill in the art would be able to<br>
test a variety oÂ£ different Neisseria meningitidis surface<br>
proteins to determine if they are "highly conserved".<br>
As used herein, "immunologically accessible" means<br>
that the Neisseria meningitidis surface protein is present<br>
at the srurface oÂ£ the organism and is accessible to<br>
antibodies. Example 2 sets forth methods by which one of<br>
skill in the art would be able to test a variety of<br>
different Neisseria meningitidis surface proteins to<br>
determine if they are "immunologically accessible".<br>
Inmiunological accessibility may be determined by other<br>
methods, including an -agglutination assay, an ELISA, a<br>
RIA, an immunoblotting assay, a dot-enzyme assay, a<br>
surface accessibility assay, electron microscopy, or a<br>
combination of these assays.<br>
As used herein, "fragments" of the Neisseria<br>
meningitidis surface protein include polypeptides having<br>
at least one peptide epitope, or analogues -and derivatives<br>
thereof Peptides of this type may be obtained through<br>
the application of molecular biology or synthesized using<br>
conventional liquid or solid phase peptide synthesis<br>
techniques.<br>
As used herein, "analogues" of the Neisseria<br>
meningitidis surface protein include those proteins, or<br>
fragments thereof, wherein one or more amino acid residues<br>
in the naturally occurring sequence is replaced by .another<br>
amino acid residue, providing that the overall<br>
functionality and protective properties of this protein<br>
are preserved. Such analogues may be produced<br>
synthetically, or Joy recombinant UNA technology, for<br>
example, by mutagenesis of a naturally occurring Neisseria<br>
meningitidis surface protein. Such procedures are well<br>
known in the art.<br>
For example, one such analogue is selected from the<br>
recombinant protein that may be produced from the gene for<br>
the 22kDa protein from Neisseria gonorrhoeae strain b2, as<br>
depicted in Figure 10. A further analog may be obtained<br>
from the isolation of the corresponding gene from<br>
Neisseria. lactatnica.<br>
As used herein, a "derivative" of the Neisseria<br>
meningitidis surface protein is a protein or fragment<br>
thereof that has been covalently modified, for example,<br>
with, dinitrophenol, in order to render it innnunogenic in<br>
humans. The derivatives of this invention also include<br>
derivatives of the amino acid analogues of this invention.<br>
It will be understood that by following the examples<br>
of this invention, one of skill in the art may determine<br>
without undue experimentation whether a particular<br>
fragment, analogue or derivative would be useful in the<br>
diagnosis, prevention or treatment of Neisseria<br>
meningitidis diseases.<br>
This invention also includes polymeric forms of the<br>
Neisseria meningitidis surface proteins, fragments,<br>
analogues and derivatives. These polymeric forms include,<br>
for example, one or more polypeptides that have been<br>
crosslinked with crosslinkers such as avidin/biotin,<br>
gluteraldehyde or dimethylsuberimidate, Such polymeric<br>
forms also include polypeptides containing two or more<br>
tandem or inverted contiguous Neisseria meningitidis<br>
sequences, produced from multicistronic mRNAs generated by<br>
recombinant UNA technology.<br>
This invention provides substantially pure Neissria<br>
meningitidis surface protiens. The term "substantially<br>
pure" means that the Neisseria meningitidis surface<br>
protein according to the invention is free from other<br>
proteins of Neisseria meningitidis origin. Substantially<br>
pure Neisseria -meningitidis surface protein preparations<br>
can be obtained by a variety of conventional processes,<br>
for example the procedure described in Examples 3 and 11.<br>
In a further aspect, the invention particularly<br>

meningritidis having the amino acid sequence of Figure 1<br>
(SEQ ID N0:2), or a fragment, analogue or derivative<br>

surface protein of Neisseria. gonorrhoeae having the amino<br>
acid sequence of Figure 10 {SEQ ID NO;8), or a fragment,<br>

the above, any reference to the Neisseria meningitidis<br>
22kDa protein also encompasses 22kDa proteins isolated<br>
from or made from genes isolated from Other species of.<br>
Neisseriacae such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Neisseria<br>
lacpcmica.<br>

This invention also provides, for the first time, -a<br>
DNA sequence coding for the Neisseria meningitidis 22 kDa<br>
surface protein (SEQ ID NO:1, N0:3, NO:5, and NO:7}. "The<br>
preferred dna sequences of this invention are selected<br>
from the group consisting of:<br>
(a) the DNA sequence oÂ£ Figure 1 {SEQ ID NO:l);<br>
(b) the DNA sequence of Figure 8 {SEQ ID NO:3) ;<br>

(f) DNA sequences degenerate to any of the foregoing<br>
DNA sequences; .and<br>
(g) fragments of any of the foregoing DNA sequences;<br>
wherein said sequences encode a product that displays the<br>
immunological activity of the Neisseria meningitidis 22<br>
kDa surface protein.<br>
Such fragments are preferably peptides as depicted in<br>
Figure 15 {SEQ ID NO:9, through SEQ ID NO:26}.<br>
Preferably, this invention also provides, for the<br>
first time, a DNA sequence coding for the Neisseria<br>
meningitidis 22 kDa surface protein (SEQ ID NO:1) . More<br>
preferred DNA sequences of this invention are selected<br>
from the group consisting of:<br>
(a) the DNA sequence of Figure 1 {SEQ ID NO: 1);<br>
(b) analogues or derivatives of the foregoing DNA<br>
sequences;<br>
(c) DMA sequences degenerate to any of the foregoing<br>
DNA sequences; and<br>
(d) fragments of any of the foregoing DNA sequences;<br>
wherein said sequences encode a product that displays the<br>

KDa surface protein.<br>
Analogues and derivatives of the Neisseria<br>
meningitidis 22 kDa surface protein codling gene will<br>
hybridize to the 22 kDa surface protein-coding gene under<br>
the conditions -described in Example 4 .<br>
For purposes of this invention, the fragments,<br>
analogues and derivatives of the Neisseria meningitidis 22<br>
kDa surface protein have the "immunological activity" of<br>
the Neisseria meningitidis 22 kDa surface protein if they<br>
can induce, when injected into an animal host, the<br>
development of an intmunological response that can protect<br>
against Neisseria meningitidis infection. One of skill in<br>
the art may determine whether a particular DNA sequence<br>
encodes a product ~thst displays the immunological activity<br>
oÂ£ the Neisseria menirxgitidis 22 kDa surface protein by<br>
following the procedures set forth herein in Exsmple 6.<br>
The Neisseria meningitidis surface proteins of this<br>
invention may be isolated by a method comprising the<br>
following steps:<br>
a) isolating a culture of Neisseria meningitidis<br>
bacteris,<br>
b) isolating an outer membrane portion from the<br>
culture of the bacteria; -and<br>
c) isolating said antigen from the outer membrane<br>
portion.<br>
In particular, the foregoing step (c) may include the<br>
additional steps of treating the Neisseria meningitidis<br>
outer membrane protein extracts with proteinase K,<br>
followed by protein fractionation using conventional<br><br>
chrpmatography and electrophoresis.<br>
Alternatively and preferably, the Neisseria<br>
meningitidis surface proteins of this invention may be<br>
produced by the use of molecular biology techniques, as<br>
more particularly described in Example 3 herein. The use<br>
of molecular biology techniques is particularly well-<br>
suited for the preparation of substantially pure<br>
recombinant Neisseria meningitidis 22 fcDa surface protein.<br>
Thus according to a further aspect of the invention<br>
we provide a process for the production of recombinant<br>
Neisseria meningitidis -22 kDa surface protein, including<br>
fragments, analogues and derivatives thereof, comprising<br>
the steps of (1) culfcuring a unicellular host organism<br>
transformed with a recombinant DNA molecule including a<br>
DKA sequence coding for said protein, fragment, analogue<br>
or derivative and one or more -expression control sequences<br>
operatively linked to the Dna sequence, and (2) recovering<br>
a substantially pure protein, fragment, analogue or<br>
derivative.<br>
As is well known in the art, in order to obtain high<br>
expression levels of a transfacted gene in a host, the<br>
g&amp;ne must be operatively linked to trranscriptional and<br>
translational expression control sequences that are<br>
functional in the chosen expression host. Preferably, the<br>
expression control sequences, and the gene of interest,<br>
will be contained in an expression vector that further<br>
comprises a bacterial selection marker and origin of<br>
replication. If the expression host is a eukaryotic cell,<br>
the expression vector should further comprise an<br>
expression marker useful in the expression host.<br>
A wide variety of expression host/vector combinations<br>
may be employed in expressing the DNA sequences of this<br>
invention. Useful expression vectors for eukaryotic hosts<br>
include, for example, vectors comprising expression<br>
control sequences from SV40, bovine papilloma virus,<br>
adenovirus and cytomegalovirus. Useful expression vectors<br>
for bacterial hosts include known bacterial plasmids, such<br>
as plasmids from E.coli, including col El, pCRl, pBR322,<br>
pMB9 and their derivatives, wider host range plasmids,<br>
such as RP4, pnage DNAs, e.g., the numerous derivatives of<br>
phage lambda, e.g. NM989, and other DNA phages, such as<br>
M13 and -filamentous single stranded DNA phages. Useful<br>
expression vectors for yeast cells include the 2 mu<br>
plasmid and derivatives thereof. Useful vectors for<br>
inject cells include pVL 941.<br>
Ill addition, any of a wide variety of expression<br>
control sequences may be used in "these vectors to express<br>
the DNA sequences of this invention. Such useful<br>
expression control sequences include the expression<br>
control sequences associated with structural genes oÂ£ the<br>
foregoing expression vecrtors . Examples of useful<br>
expression control sequences include, for example, the<br>
early and late promoters of SV40 or adenovirus, the lac<br>
system, the trp system, the TAC or TRC system, the major<br>
operator and promoter regions of phage lambda, the control<br>
regions of fd coat protein, the promoter for 3-<br>
phosphoglycerate kinase or other glycolytic enzymes, the<br>
promoters of acid phosphatase, eg., pho5, the promoters<br>
of the yeast alpha-mating system and other sequences known<br>
to control expression of genes of prokaryotic and<br>
eukaryotic cells or their viruses, and various<br>
combinations thereof. The Neisseria meningitidis 22 kDa<br>
surface protein's expression control sequence is<br>
particularly useful in the expression of the Neisseria<br>
meningitidis 22 kDa surface protein in E.coli (Example 3).<br>
Host cells transformed with the foregoing vectors<br>
form a further aspect of this invention, A wide variety<br>
of unicellular host cells are useful in expressing the DNA<br>
sequences of this invention. These hosts may include well<br>
known eukaryotic and prokaryotic hosts, such as strains of<br>
S.coli, Pseudomonas, Bacillus, Streptomycea, fungi, yeast,<br>
insect cells such as Spodoptera. frugiperda (SF9), animal<br>
cells such as CHO and mouse cells, African green monkey<br>
cells such as COS 1, COS 7, BSC 1, BSC 40, and BMT 10, and<br>
human cells and plant cells in tissue culture. Preferred<br>
host organisms include bacteria such as E.coli and<br>
Bacillus subtilis and mammalian cells in tissue culture.<br>
It should of course be understood that not all<br>
vectors and expression control sequences will function<br>
equally well to express the DNA sequences of this<br>
invention. Neither will all hosts function equally well<br>
with the same expression system. However, one of skill in<br>
the art may make a selection among these vectors,<br>
expression control sequences and hosts without undue<br>
experimentation and without departing from the scope of<br>
this invention. For example, in selecting a vector, the<br>
host must be Considered because the vector must replicate<br>
in it. The vector's copy number, the ability to control<br>
that copy number and the expxession of any other proteins<br>
encoded by the vector, such as antibiotic markers, should<br>
also be considered.<br>
In selecting an expression control sequence, a<br>
variety of factors should also be considered. "These<br>
include, for example, the relative strength of the<br>
sequence, its controllability, and its compatibility with<br>
the DNA sequences of this invention, particularly as<br>
regards portential secondary structures . Unicellular hosts<br>
should be selected by consideration of their compatibility<br>
with the chosen vector, the toxicity of the product coded<br>
for by the DNA sequences of this invention, their<br>
secretion characteristics, their ability to fold the<br>
protein correctly, their fermentation or culture<br>
requirements, and the ease of purification from them of<br>
the products coded for by the DMA sequences of this<br>
invention.<br>
Within these parameters, one of skill in the art may<br>
select various vector/expression control sequence/host<br>
combinations that will express the DNA sequences of this<br>
invention on fermentation or in large scale animal<br>
culture.<br>
The polypeptides encoded by the DNA sequences of this<br>
invention may be isolated from the fermentation or cell<br>
culture and purified using any of a variety of<br>
conventional methods. One of skill in the art may select<br>
the most appropriate isolation and purification techniques<br>
without departing from the scope of this invention.<br>
The Neisseria meningitidis surface proteins of this<br>
invention are useful in prophylactic, therapeutic and<br>
diagnostic compositions for preventing, treating and<br>
diagnosing diseases caused by Neisseria meningitidis<br>
infection.<br>

surface protein to generate monoclonal or polyvalent anti-<br>
Neissrria Meningitidis antibodies or to induce the<br>
development of a protective immunological response against<br>

Neisseria meningitidis surface proteins of this invention<br>
as immunogens for the production of specific antibodies<br>
for the diagnosis and in particular the treatment of<br>
Neisseria meningitidis infection. Suitable antibodies may<br>
be determined using appropriate screening methods, for<br>

EXAMPLE 1 Treatment Of Neisseris meningitidis Outer<br>
Meanbrane Preparations with proteolytic Bnzymes<br>
And The Subsequent Identification Of An Enzyme<br>
Resistant Ueisseria maningitldig 22 kDa Surface<br>
Protein<br>
Several antigenic preparations derived from whole<br>
cell, lithium chloride, or sarcosyl extracts were used to<br>
study the ultrastrueture of Neisseria meningitidis outer<br>
membrane. The outer membrane of Gram negative bacteria<br>
acts as an interface between the environment and the<br>
interior of the cell and contains most of the antigens<br>
that are freely exposed to the host itnraune defense. The<br>
main goal of the study was the identification of new<br>
antigens which can induce a protective response against<br>
Neisseiria menlngitldis. One approach used by the<br>
inventors to identify such antigens, was the partial<br>
disruption of the antigenic preparations mentioned bove<br>
with proteolytic enaymes. The antigenic determinants<br>
generated by the enzymatic treatments could then be<br>
identified by the subsequent analysis of the immunological<br>
and protective properties of these treated antigenic<br>
preparations. To our surprise we observed after<br>
electrophoretic resolution of Neisseria meningitldis<br>
lithium chloride outer membrane extracts, that one low<br>
molecular weight band, which, was stained with Coomassie<br>
Brilliant Blue R-250, was not destroyed by proteolytic<br>
enzyme treatments. Coomassie Blue is used to stain<br>
proteins and peptides and has no no very little affinity<br>
for the polysaccharides or lipids which are also -key<br>
components of the outer membrane. The fact that this low<br>
molecular weight antigen was stained by Coomassie blue<br>
suggested that at least part -of it As wade up -of<br>
polypeptides that are not digested toy_proteolytic eanzymes,<br>
or that are protected against the action oÂ£ the enzymes by<br>
other surface structures. Moreover, as demonstrated below<br>
the very potent enzyme profceinase K did not digest this<br>
low molecular weight antigen even after extensive<br>
treatments.<br>
Lithium chloride extraction was used to obtain the<br>
outer membrane preparations from different strains of<br>
Neisseria meningitidis and was performed in a manner<br>
previously described by the inventors [Brodeur et al.,<br>
Infect. Immun., 50, p. 510 (1985)3. The protein content<br>
of these preparations were determined by the Lowry method<br>
adapted to membrane fractions [Lowry et al., J. Biol.<br>
chem. 193, p. 265 (1951)]. Outer membrane preparations<br>
derived from Neisseria meningitidis strain 608B<br>
(B:2a;P1.2) were treated for 24 hours at 37Â°C and<br>
continuous shaking with either a-chymotrypsin from bovine<br>
pancreas (E.C. 3.4.21.1) (Sigma) or trypsin type 1 from<br>
bovine pancreas (E.C, 3.4.21.4) (Sigma). The enzyme<br>
concentration was adjusted at 2 mg per mg of protein to be<br>
treated. The same outer membrane preparations were also<br>
treated with different concentrations (0.5 to 24 mg per mg<br>
of protein) of proteinase K from Tritirachium Album limber<br>
(Sigma or Boehringer Mannheim, Laval, Canada) (E.C.<br>
3.4.21.14). In order to promote protein digestion by<br>
proteinase K, different experimental conditions were used.<br>
The .samples were incubated for 1 hour,, 2. -hours, 24 hours<br>
or 4 8 hours at 37Â°C or 56Â°C with or without shaking. The<br>
pH of the mixture samples was adjusted at either pH 7.2 or<br>
pH 9.(L One % (vol/vol) of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)<br>
was also added to certain samples. Immediately after<br>
treatment the samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE gel<br>
electrophoresis using the MiniProteanllÂ® (Bio-Rad,<br>
Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) system on 14% (wt/vol) gels<br>
according to -the manufacturer's -instructions. Proteins<br>
were heated to 100Â°c for 5 minutes with 2-mercaptoethanol<br>
and SDS, separated on 14% SDS gels, and stained with<br>
Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250.<br>
Figure 2 presents the migration profile on 14% SDS-<br>
PAGE gel of the proteins present in outer membrane<br>
preparations derived from Neisseria xneningltidis strain<br>
608B (B:2a:PI.2) after treatment at 31Â°C tax 24 hours with<br>
a chymotrypsin and trypsin. Extensive proteolytic<br>
digestion of the high molecular weight proteins and of<br>
several major outer membrane proteins can be observed for<br>
the treated samples {Figure 2, lanes 3 and 4) compared to<br>
the untreated control (Figure 2, lane 2) . On the<br>
contrary, a protein band with an apparent molecular weight<br>
of 22 kDa was not affected even after 24 hours of contact<br>
with either proteolytic enzyme.<br>
This unique protein was further studied using a more<br>
aggressive proteolytic treatment with Proteinase k<br>
(Figure 3). Proteinase K is one of the most powerful<br>
proteolytic enzymes since it has a low peptide bond<br>
specificity and wide pH optimum. Surprisingly, the 22 kDa<br>
protein was resistant to digestion by 2 International<br>
Units (IU) of proteinase K for 24, hours at 56Â°C (Figure 3,<br>
lane 2). This treatment is often used in our laboratory<br>
to produce lipopolysaccharides or DNA that are almost free<br>
of proteins. Indeed, only small polypeptides can be seen<br>
after such an aggressive proteolytic treatment of the<br>
outer membrane preparation. Furthermore, longer<br>
treatments, <br>
up to 4S hours, or higher enzyifte<br>
concentrations (up to 24 IU) did not alter the amount of<br>
the 22 kDa protein. The amount and migration on SDSPAGE<br>
gel of the 22 kDa protein were not affected when the pK of<br>
the reaction mixtures was increased to pH 9.0, or when<br>
1.0% of SDS, a strong protein denaturant was added (Jigure<br>
3, lanes 4, 6 and 8). The combined tise of these two<br>
denaturing conditions would normally result in the<br>
complete digestion of the proteins present in the outer<br>
membrane preparations, leaving onlyamiÂ«oacid residues.<br>
Polypeptides oÂ± low molecular weight were often observed<br>
in the digests and were assumed to be fragments of<br>
sensitive proteins not effectively digested "during "the<br>
enzymatic treatments. These fragments were most .probably<br>
protected irom further degradation by the carbohydrates<br>
and lipids present in the outer membrane. The bands with<br>
apparent molecular weight of 28 KDa and 34 JcDa which are<br>
present in treated samples are respectively the residaai<br>
enzyme and a contaminating protein present in all enzyme<br>
preparations tested.<br>
Interestingly, this study about the resistance of the<br>
22kDa protein to proteases indicated that another protein<br>
band with apparent molecular weight of 18kDa seems to be<br>
also resistant to enzymatic degradation (Figure 3a), Clues<br>
about this 18kDa protein band were obtained when the<br>
migration profiles on SDS-PAGE gels of affinity purified<br>
recombinant 22kDa protein were analyzed (Figure 3b) . The<br>
IS kDa band was apparent only when the affinity purified<br>
recombinant 22kDa protein was heated for an extended<br>
period of time in sample buffer containing the detergent<br>
SDS before it was applied on the gel, N-terminal amino<br>
acid analysis using the Edman degradation (Example 3)<br>
clearly established that the amino acid residues (E-g-A-S-<br>
G-F-Y-V-Q) identified on the 18 kDa band corresponded to<br>
the amino acids 1-9 (SEQ ID NO. 1). These resalts indicate<br>
that the 18 and 22kDa bands as seen on the SDSFAGE is in<br>
fact derived from the same protein. This lastresult also<br>
indicates that the leader sequence is cleaved from the<br>
mature 18 kDa protein. Further studies will be done to<br>
identify the molecular modifications explaining this shift<br>
in apparent molecular weight and to evaluate their impact<br>
on the antigenic and protective properties of the protein.<br>
in conclusion, the discovery of a Neisseria.<br>
meningitidis outer membrane protein with the very rare<br>
property of being resistant to proteolytic digestion<br>
warranted further study of its molecular and immunological<br>
characteristics. The purified recombinant 22 kDa surface<br>
protein produced by Escherichia coli in Example 3 is also<br>
highly resistant to proteinase K digestion. We are<br>
presently trying to understand the mechanism which confers<br>
to the Neisseria meningitidis 22 kDa surface protein this<br>
unusual resistance to proteolytic enzymes.<br>
EXAMPLE 2 Generation of Monoclonal Antibodies Specific for<br>
the 22 kDA Neisseria maningitidis Surface<br>
Protein<br>
The monoclonal antibodies described herein were<br>
obtained from three independent fusion experiments.<br>
Female Balb/c mice (Charles River Laboratories, st<br>
Constant, Quebec, Canada) were immunised with outer<br>
membrane preparations obtained from Neisseriameninitidis<br>
strains 604A, 608B and 2241C respectively serogrouped A, B<br>
and C. The lithium chloride extraction used to obtain<br>
these outer membrane preparations was performed in a<br>
mannerpreviously described by the inventors. {Brodeur<br>
et al., Infect. Immun, 50, p. 510 (1985)]. The .protein<br>
content of these preparations were determined by the Lowry<br>
method adapted to membrane fractions [Lowry et al., J.<br>
Biol, Chem. 193, p. 265 {1951}]. Groups ot mice were<br>
injected intraperitoneally or subcutaneously twiee, at<br>
threeweek intervale with 10 mg of different combinations<br>
of the outer membrane preparations described above.<br>
Depending on the group of mice, the adjuvants used for the<br>
immunizations were either Freund's complete or incomplete<br>
adjuvant (Gibco Laboratories, Grand Island, N.Y.), or<br>
QuilA (CedarLane Laboratories, Hornby, Ont,, Canada).<br>
Three days before the fusion Procedure, the immunised mice<br>
received a final intravenous injection of 10 mg of one of<br>
the outer membrane preparations described above. The<br>
fusion protocol used to produce the hybridoma cell lines<br>
secreting the desired monoclonal antibody was described<br>
previously by the inventors [Hamel et al., J. Med.<br>
microbiol., 25, p. 2434 (1987)]. The class, subclass and<br>
lightchain type of monoclonal antibodies Me-1, Me2, Me<br>
3, Me-5, Me-6 and Me-7 were determined by ELISA as<br>
previously reported (Martin et al., J. Clin. Microbiol,,<br>
28, p. 1720 (1990)] and are presented in Table 1.<br>
The specificity of the monoclonal antibodies was<br>
established using Western immunoblotting following the<br>
method previously described by the inventors [Martin<br>
et al, Eur. J, Immunol. 18, p. 601 {1988)] with the<br>
following modifications. Outer membrane preparations<br>
obtained from different strains of Neisseria meningitidis<br>
were resolved on 14% SDS-PAGE gels. The proteins were<br>
transferred from the gels to nitrocellulose membranes<br>
using a semidry apparatus (BioâRad), Acurrent of 60 mA<br>
per gel (6X10cm) was applied for 10 minutes in the<br>
electroblot buffer consisting of 25 mM Tris-HCl, 192 mM<br>
glycine and 20% (vol/vol) zaethanol, pH 8.3. The western<br>
immunablotting experiments clearly indicated that the<br>
monoclonal antibodies Me-1, Me-2, Me-3, Me-5, Me-6 and Me<br>
7 .recognized their specific epitopes xm "the Neisseria<br>
meqingitldis 22 kDa protein (Figure 4A). Analysis of the<br>
SDS-PAGE gels and the corresponding Western immunoblots<br>
also indicated that the apparent molecular weight of this<br>
protein does not vary from one strain to another.<br>
However, the amount of protein present in the outer<br>
membrane preparations varied from one strain to another<br>
and was not related to the serogroup of the strain.<br>
Moreover, these monoclonal antibodies still recognized<br>
their epitopes on the Neisseria meningltidls 22 kDa<br>
surface protein after treatment of the outer membrane<br>
preparation with 2 IU of proteinase K per mg of protein<br>
(treatment described in Example 1, supra) 1 Figure 4B).<br>
Interestingly, the epitopes remained intact after the<br>
enzyme digestion thus confirming that even if they are<br>
accessible in the membrane preparation to the antibodies<br>
they are not destroyed by the enzyme treatment. This<br>
latter result suggested that the mechanism which explains<br>
the observed proteinase K resistance is most probably not<br>
related to surface structures blocking the access of the<br>
enzyme to the protein, or to the protection offered by the<br>
membrane to proteins which are deeply embedded. While not<br>
shown in Figure 4, the results of the immunoblots for Me-l<br>
were consistent with the results for the other five<br>
monoclonal antibodies.<br>
A series of experiments were performed to partially<br>
characterise the Neisseria meningitidis 22 kDa surface<br>
protein and to differentiate it from the other known<br>
meningococcal surface proteins. No shift in apparent<br>
molecular weight on SDSFAGE gel of the Neisseria<br>
meningitidis 22 kDa surface protein was noted when outer<br>
membrane preparations were heated at lOO0C for 5 minutes,<br>
or at 37Â°C and 56Â°C for 30 minutes in electrophoresis<br>
sample buffer with or without 2-mercaptoethanol. This<br>
indicated that the migration of the 22kDa surface protein,<br>
when present in the outer membrane, was not heat or 2-<br>
msrcaptoethanol-modifiable.<br>
Sodium periodate oridation was used to determine if<br>
the monoclonal antibodies reacted with carbohydrate<br>
epitopes present in the outer membrane preparations<br>
extracted from Neisseria meniugitidis organisms. T'he<br>
method used to perform this experiment was previously<br>
described by the inventors.[Martin et al., Infect.<br>
Immun., 60, pp. 27182725 (1992)]. Treatment of outer<br>
membrane preparations with 100 mM of sodium pericdate for<br>
1 hour at room temperature did not alter the reactivity of<br>
the monoclonal antibodies toward the Neisseria.<br>
meningitidis 22 kDa surface protein. This treatment<br>
normally abolishes the binding of antibodies that are<br>
specific for carbohydrates.<br>
Monoclonal antibody 2-1-CA2 {provided by Dr. A.<br>
Bhattacharjee, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research,<br>
Washington, D.C.) is specific for the lip protein (also<br>
called H.8), a surface antigen common to all pathogenic<br>
Neisseria species. The reactivity of this monoclonal<br>
: antibody with outer membrane preparations was compared to<br>
the reactivity of monoclonal antibody Me-5. The lip-<br>
specific monoclonal antibody reacted with a protein band<br>
having an apparent molecular weight of 30 kDa, while<br>
monoclonal antibody Me5 reacted with the protein band of<br>
22 kDa. This result clearly indicates that there is no<br>
relationship between Nelsseria meningitldis 22 kDa surface<br>
protein and thelip protein, another highly conserved<br>
outer membrane protein.<br>
To verify the exposure of the 22 kDa protein at the<br>
surface of intact Neisseria meningitidis bacterial cells,<br>
a radiointmunoassay was performed as previously described<br>
by the inventors [Proulx et al, Infec, Immun., 59, p. 963<br>
(1991)]. Sixhour and 18hour bacterial cultures were<br>
used for this assay. The six monoclonal antibodies were<br>
reacted with 9 Neisseria meningitidis strains (the<br>
serogroup of the strain is indicated in parentheses on<br>
Figure 5), 2 Neisseria gonorrhoeas strains ("NG"), 2<br>
Moraxella catarrhalis strains ("MC") and 2 Neisseria<br>
lactamica Strains ("NL"), The radioiuamunoassay confirmed<br>
that the epitopes recognized by the monoclonal antibodies<br>
are exposed at the surface of intact Neisseria<br>
meningitidis isolates of different serotypes and<br>
serogroups and should also be accessible to the<br>
proteolytic enzymes (Figure 5). The monoclonal antibodies<br>
bound strongly to their target epitopes on the surface of<br>
all Nelsseria meningitidis strains tested. The recorded<br>
binding values (between 3,000 to 35,000 CPM), varied from<br>
one strain to another, and with the physiological state of<br>
the bacteria, A Haemophilus influenzae porinâspecific<br>
monoclonal antibody was used as a negative control for<br>
each bacterial strain. Counts below 500 CPM were obtained<br>
and subsequently subtracted from each binding value. With<br>
respect to the Neisseria meningitidis strains, tested in<br>
this assay, the results shown in. Figure 5 for monoclonal<br>
antibodies Me-5 and Me-7 are representative of the results<br>
obtained with monoclonal antibodies Me-1, Me-2, Me-3 and<br>
Me-6. With respect to the other bacterial strains tested<br>
the binding activities shown for Me7 are representative<br>
of the binding activities obtained with, other monoclonal<br>
antibodies that recognized the same bacterial strain.<br>
The antigenic conservation of the epitopes recognized<br>
by the monoclonal antibodies was also evaluated. A dot<br>
enzyme irnmunoassay was used for the rapid screening of the<br>
monoclonal antibodies against a large number of bacterial<br>
strains. This assay was performed as previously described<br>
by the inventors [Lussier et al., J. Immnoassay, 10, p.<br>
373 (1985)]. A. collection of 71 Neisseria meniagitidis<br>
strains was used in this study. The sample included 19<br>
isolates of serogroup A, 23 isolates of serogroup. B, 13<br>
isolates of serogroup C, 1 isolate of serogroup 29E, 6<br>
isolates of serogroup W-135, 1 isolate of serogroup X, 2<br>
isolates of serogroup Y, 2 isolates of serqgroup Z, and 4<br>
isolates that were not serogrouped ("NS"). These isolates<br>
were obtained from the Caribbean Epidemiology Centre, Port<br>
of Spain, Trinidad; Children's Hospital ,of Eastern<br>
Ontario, Ottawar Canada; Department of Saskatchewan<br>
Health, Regina, Canada; Laboratoire de Sante Publique du<br>
Quebec, Montreal, Canada; Max-Planck Institut fur<br>
Molekulare Genetik, Berlin, FRG; Montitreal Children<br>
Hospital, Montreal, Canada; Victoria General Hospital,<br>
Halifax, Canada; and our own strains collection. The<br>
following bacterial species were also tested: 16 Neisserla<br>
gonorrhoeae, 4 Neisseria cinerea, 5 Neisseria lactamica, 1<br>
Neisseria Â£lava, 1 Neisseria flavescens, 3 Neisseria<br>
mucosa, 4 Neisseria perflava/sicca, 4 Neisseria perflava,<br>
1 Neisseria sicca, 1 Neisseria subflava and 5 Moraxella<br>
catarrhalis, 1 Alcaligenes feacaliz (ATCC 87505, 1<br>
Citrobacter freuxidii (ATCC 2080), 1 Edwarsiella tarda<br>
(ATCC 15947), 1 Snterobacter cloaca [ATCC 23355), 1<br>
Enterobacter aercgenes (ATCC 13048), 1 Escherichia coli, 1<br>
Flavobacterium odoratum, 1 Haemophilus inflttenzae type b<br>
(Eagan strain), X Klebsiella pneumoniae (ATCC 13883) , 1<br>
Proteus rettgeri {ATCC 25932), 1 Proteus vulgaris (ATCC<br>
13315), 1 Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 9027), l Salmonella<br>
byphimurium (ATCC 14028), 1 Serrati marcescens {ATCC<br>
8100), 1 Shigrella flexneri (ATCC 12022), 1 Shigella sonnei<br>
(ATCC 9290) . They were obtained from the American Type<br>
Culture Collection or a collection held in the Laboratory<br>
Centre for Disease Control, Ottawa, Canada. The<br>
reactivities of the monoclonal antibodies with the most<br>
relevant Neisseria strains are presented in Table 1, One<br>
monoclonal antibody, Me-7, recognized its specific epitope<br>
on 100% of the 71 Neisseria meningitidis strains tested.<br>
This monoclonal antibody, as well as Me-2, Me-3, Me-5 and<br>
Me-6 also reacted with certain strains belonging to other<br>
Neisserial species indicating that their specific epitope<br>
is also expressed by other closely related Neisseriaoeae.<br>
Except for a faint reaction with one Neissera lactamica<br>
strain, monoclonal antibody Me-1 reacted only with<br>
Neisseiria meningitidis isolates. Me-1 was further tested<br>
vith another sample of 177 Neisseria meningitidis<br>
isolates and was able to correctly identify more titan 99%<br>
of the total Neisseria meningitidis strains tested.<br>
Besides the Neisseria strains presented in Table 1, the<br>
monoclonal antibodies did not react with any Of the other<br>
bacterial species mentioned above.<br>
In conclusion, six monoclonal antibodies which<br>
specifically reacted with the Neisseria meningitidis 22<br>
kDa surface protein were generated by the inventors.<br>
Using these monoclonal antibodies we demonstrated that<br>
their specific epitopes are 1) located on a proteinase K<br>
resistant 22 kDa protein present in the outer membrane of<br>
Neisseria msnlagdtidis, 2) conserved among Neisseria.<br>
meningitidis isolates, 3) exposed at the surface of intact<br>
Neisseria meningitidis cells and accessible to antibody.<br>
and 4) the reactivity of these monoclonal antibodies with<br>
the Neisseria meningitidis 22 kDa surface protein is not<br>
modified by a treatment with sodium periodate, suggesting<br>
that their specific epitopes are not located on<br>
carbohydrates.<br>
Although we found that the migration of the Neisseria<br>
meningitidis 22kDa protein is moved to an apparent<br>
molecular weight of about 18kDa when heated under<br>
stringent conditions, we observed that the migration is<br>
 not modified by 2-mercaptoethanol treatment,<br>
We also demonstrated that the Neisseria meningitidis<br>
22 kDa surface protein has no antigenic similarity with<br>
the lip protein, another low molecular weight and highly<br>
conserved protein present in the outer membrane of<br>
Neiaseria meningitidis,<br>
As will be presented in Example 3, these monoclonal<br>
antibodies also reacted with the purified, recobinant 22<br>
kDa surface protein produced after transformation of<br>
Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DB3) with a plasmid vector<br>
PNP2202 containing the gene coding for the Neisseria<br>
meningitidis 22 kDa surface protein.<br>
EXAMPLE 3 Molecular Cloning, Sequencing Of The Gene, Nigh<br>
Yield Exprassion And Purification Of The<br>
Nelsseria maningitidis 22 kDa Surface Protein<br>
A Molecular Cloning<br>
A LambdaGEM-11 genomic DNA library from Neisseria<br>
maningitidis strain 608B (B:2a:P1.2) was constructed<br>
according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Promega<br>
CO, Madison, WI) Briefly, the genomie DNA of the 608B<br>
strain was partially digested with Sau 3AI, and fragments<br>
ranging between 9 and 23 Kb were purified on agarose gel<br>
before being ligated to the Bam HI sites of the LambdaGEM-<br>
11 arms. The resulting recombinant phages were used to<br>
infect Escherichia coli strain LE392 (Promega) which was<br>
then plated onto LB agar plates. Nineteen positive<br>
plaques were identified after the immuno-screening of the<br>
library with the Neisseria meninigitidis 22 kDa surface<br>
proteinspecific monoclonal antibodies of Example 2 using<br>
the following protocol. The plates were incubated 15<br>
minutes at 20Â°C to harden the top agar. Nitrocellulose<br>
filters were gently applied onto the surface of the plates<br>
for 30 minutes at 4Â°C to absorb the proteins produced by<br>
the recombinant viral clones. The filters were then<br>
washed in PBS-Tween 0,02% (vol/vol) and immunoblotted as<br>
described previously [Lussier et al., J. Imnunoassay, 10,<br>
p. 373 (1989)]. After amplification and DNa purification,<br>
one viral clone, designated clone 8, which had a 13 Kb<br>
insert was selected for the subcloning experiments. After<br>
digestion of this clone with Sac I, two fragments of 5 and<br>
8 Kb were obtained. These fragments were purified on<br>
agarpse gel and ligated into the Sac I restriction site of<br>
the low copy number plasmid pWKS30 [Wang and Kushner,<br>
Gene, 100, p. 195 (1991)]. The recombinant plasmids were<br>
used to transform Escherichia coli strain JK109 (Promega)<br>
by electroporation (Bio-Rad, Mississauga, Ont., Canada)<br>
following the manufacturer's recommendations, and the<br>
resulting colonies were screened with the Neisseria<br>
meningitidis 22 kDa surface proteinspecific monoclonal<br>
antibodies of Example 2. Positive colonies were observed<br>
only when the bacteria were transformed with the plasmid<br>
carrying the S Kb insert. Western blot analysis (the<br>
methodology was described in Example 2) of. the positive<br>
clones showed that the protein expressed by Escherichia<br>
coli vas complete and migrated on SDS-PAGE gel like the<br>
Neisseria meningritidis 22 kDa surface protein. To further<br>
reduce the size of the insert, a clone containing the 6 Kb<br>
fragment was digested with. Cla I and a 275 Kb fragment<br>
was then ligated into the Cla I site of the pWKS30<br>
plasmid. V7estern blot analysis of the resulting clones<br>
clearly indicated once again that the protein expressed by<br>
Escherichia. coli was complete and migrated on SDS-PAGE gel<br>
like the native Neisseria meningitidis 22kDa surface<br>
protein.<br>
After restriction analysis, two clones, designated<br>
PNP2202 and pNP2203, were shown to carry the 2.75 Kb<br>
insert in opposite orientations and were selected to<br>
proceed with the sequencing of the gene coding for the<br>
Neisseria meningitidis 22 kDa surface protein. The<br>
"Double stranded Nested Delation Kit" from Pharmacia<br>
Biotech Inc. (piscataway, NJ) was used according to the<br>
manufacturer's instructions to generate a series of nested<br>
deletions from both clones. The resulting truncated<br>
inserts were then sequenced from the M13 forward primer<br>
present on the pWKS30 vector with the "Tag Dye Deoxy<br>
Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit" using an Applied<br>
Biosystems Inc. {Foster City, CA) automated sequencer<br>
model 373A according to the manufacturer's<br>
recommendations <br>
B. Sequence Analysis<br>
After the insert was sequenced in both directions,<br>
the micleotide sequence revealed an open reading frame<br>
consisting of 525 nucleotides (including the stop codon)<br>
encoding a protein composed of 174 amino acid residues<br>
having a predicted molecular weight of 18,000 Daltons and<br>
a pI of 9.93, The nucleotide and deduced amino acid<br>
sequences are presented in Figure 1 (SEQ ID NO:1; SEQ ID<br>
N0:2).<br>
To confirm the correct expression of the cloned gene,<br>
the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the native 22 kDa<br>
surface protein derived from Neisseria meningitidis strain<br>
603B was determined in order to compare it with the amino<br>
acid,sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequencing data.<br>
Outer membrane preparation derived from Neisseria<br>
meningitidis strain 608B was resolved by electrophoresis<br>
on a 14% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred onto a<br>
polyvinylidine dixluoride membrane (Millipore Products,<br>
Bedford MA) according to a previously described method<br>
[Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning; a laboratory manual,<br>
Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press (1939)]. The 22 kDa<br>
protein band was excised from the gel and then subjected<br>
to Edman degradation using the Applied Biosystems Inc.<br>
(Poster City, CA) model 473A automated protein sequencer<br>
following the manufacturer's recommendations, The amino<br>
acid sequence E-G-A-S-G-F-Y-V-Q-A corresponded to amino<br>
acids 110 (SEQ ID NO:2) of the open reading frame,<br>
indicating that the Neisseria menittgltldis strain 608B, 22<br>
kDa surface protein has a 19 amino acid .leader peptide<br>
(amino acid residues 19 to 1 of SEQ ID NO:2).<br>
A search of established databases confirmed that the<br>
Neisseria. meningitidis strain 608B, 22 kDa surf aceprotein<br>
(SEQ ID NO:2) or its gene {SEQ ID NO:1) have not been<br>
described previously.<br>
C. High Yield Expression And Purification of The<br>
Recombinant Neisaeria. aenlngitidis 22 kDa Surface<br>
Protein<br>
The following process was developed in order to<br>
maximize the production and purification of the<br>
reconibinant Neisseria meningitidis 22 kDa surface protein<br>
expressed in Escherichie coli. This process is based on<br>
the observation that the recombinant 22 3kDa surface<br>
protein produced by Escherichia coli Strain BL21(DE3)<br>
[Studier and Moffat, J. Mol. Biol., 139, p. 113 (198S)]<br>
carrying the plasmid pNP2202 can be found in large amounts<br>
in the outer membrane, but can also be obtained from the<br>
culture supernatant in which it is tne most abundant<br>
protein. The culture supernatant was therefore the<br>
material used to purify the recombinant 22 kDa protein<br>
using affinity chromatography (Figure 6A),<br>
To generate an affinity chromatography matrix,<br>
monoclonal antibodies Me-2, Me-3 and Me-5 (described in<br>
Example 2) were immobilized on CNBr-activaired sepharose 4B<br>
 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc., Piscataway, NJ) according to the<br>
manufacturer's instructions.<br>
To prepare the culture supernatant, an overnight<br>
culture of EBcherichia. coli strain EL21(DE3), hcarboring<br>
the plasmid pNP2202 was inoculated in LB broth (Gibco<br>
Laboratories, Grand Island, N.Y.) containing 25 mg/ml of<br>
ampicillin (Sigma) and was incubated 4 hours at B70C with<br>
agitation. The bacterial cells were removed from the<br>
culture media by two centrifugations at 10,000 Xg for 1C<br>
minutes at 4Â°C. The culture supernatant was filtered onto<br>
a 0.22 mm membrane (Millipore, Bedfords, Ma) and then<br>
concentrated approrimately 100 times using an ultra<br>
filtrafcion membrane (Amicon Co., Beverly, MA) witch a<br>
molecular cut off of 10,0OC Daltons. To completely<br>
solubilize the membrane vesicles, Empigen BB (Calbiochem<br>
Co., LaJolla, CA)) was added to the concentrated culture<br>
supernatant to a final concentration of 1% (vol/vol). The<br>
suspension was incubated at room temperature for one hour,<br>
dialyzed overnight against several liters of 10 mM Tris<br>
HC1 buffer, pH 7.3 containing 005% Empigen BB(vol/vol)<br>
and centrifuged at 10,000Xg for 20 minutes at 4Â°C. The<br>
antigen preparation was added to the affinity matarix and<br>
incubated overnight at 4Â°C with constant agitation. The<br>
gel slurry was poured into a chromatography colunai and<br>
washed extensively with 10 mM TrisHCl buffer, pH 7.3<br>
containing 0.05% Emgpigen BB (vol/vol). The recombinant 22<br>
kDa protein was then eluted from the column with. 1 M LiCl<br>
in 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.3. The solution.containing<br>
the eluted protein was dialyzed extensively against<br>
several liters of 1G mM TrigHCl buffer, pH 7.3 containing<br>
0.05% Empigen BB. Coomassie Blue and silver stained SDS<br>
Page gels [Tsai and Frasch, Analytical Biochem., 119,<br>
pp. 19 (1982)3 were used to evaluate the purity of the<br>
recombinant 22 kDa surface protein at each step of the<br>
purification process and representative results are<br>
presented in Figure 6A. Silver staining of the gels<br>
Clearly demonstrated that the purification process<br>
generated a fairly pure recombinant 22 kDa protein with<br>
only a very small quantity of Escherichia coli<br>
lipopolysaccharide.<br>
The resistance to proteolytic cleavage of the<br>
purified recombinant 22 kDa surface protein was also<br>
verified and the results are presented in Figure 6B.<br>
Purified recombinant 22 kDa surface protein was treated as<br>
described in Example 1 with a-chymotrypsin and trypsin at.<br>
2 mg per mg of protein and with 2 IU of proteinase K per<br>
mg of protein for L hour at 37Â°C with constant shaking.<br>
No reduction in the amount of protein was obsexved after<br>
any of these treatments. In comparison, partial or<br>
complete digestion depending on the enzyme selected was<br>
observed for the control protein which was in this case<br>
bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma). Furthermore, longer<br>
periods of treatment did not result in any modification of<br>
the protein. These latter results demonstrated that<br>
transformed Escherichia coli cells can express the<br>
complete recombinant 22 kDa surface protein and that this<br>
protein is also highly resistant to the action of these<br>
three proteolytic enzymes as was the native protein found<br>
in Neisseria laeningltidis. In addition, the purified<br>
recombinant 22 kDa surface protein which is not embedded<br>
in the outer membrane of Escherichia coli is still highly<br>
resistant to the action of the proteolytic enzymss.<br>
We also verified the effect of the enzymatic<br>
treatments on tne antigenic properties of the recombinant<br>
22 kDa protein. As determine by ELISA and Western<br>
immmoblotting, the monoclonal antibodies described in<br>
Example 2 readily recognized the recombinant 22 kDa<br>
surface protein that was purified according to the process<br>
described above (Figure 6C). Moreover, the reactivity of<br>
other 22 kDa proteinspecific monoclonal antibodies, with<br>
the purified recombinant 22 kDa surface protein was not<br>
altered by any of the enzyme treatments, thus confirming<br>
that the nntigenic properties of the recombinant 22 kDa<br>
protein seem similar to the ones described for the native<br>
protein.<br>
Important data were presented in Example 3 and can be<br>
summarized as follows:<br>
1} the complete nucleotide and amino acid sequences<br>
of the Neisseria meningitidis 22 kDa surface protein were<br>
obtained {SEQ ID NO:1; SEQ ID N0:2);<br>
2) N-terminal sequencing of the native protein<br>
confirmed that the Neisseriz meningitidis 22 kDa gene was<br>
indeed cloned;<br>
3) this protein was not described previously;<br>
4) it is possible to transform a host such as<br>
Escherichia coli and obtain expression of the reeombinant<br>
Neisseria meningitidis 22 kDa surface protein in high<br>
yield;<br>
5) it is possible to obtain the recombinant protein,<br>
free of other Neisserie meningitidis molecules and almost<br>
free of components produced by Escherichia coli;<br>
6) the purified reeombinant 22 kDa surface protein<br>
remains highly resistant to the action of proteolytic<br>
enzymes such as a-chymotrypsin, trypsin and proteinase K;<br>
and<br>
7) the antigenic properties of the recombinant 22 kDa<br>
protein compare to the ones described for the native<br>
Neisseria meningitidis 22 kda surface protein.<br>
EXAMPLE 4 Molecular Conservation Of The Gene Coding for<br>
the Neisseria meaingitidia 22 kDa Surface<br>
Protein<br>
To verify the molecular conservation among Naisseria.<br>
isolates of the gene coding for the Neisseria meningitidis<br>
22 kDa surface protein, a DMA dot blot hybridization assay<br>
was used to test different Neisseria species and ether<br>
bacterial species. First/ the 525 base pair gene coding<br>
for the Neisseria meningitidis 22 kDa surface protein was<br>
amplified by PCR, purified on agarose gel and labeled boy<br>
random priming with the non radioactive BIG DMA labeling<br>
and detection system (Boehringer Mannheim, Laval, Canada)<br>
following the manufacturer's instructions.<br>
The DNA dot blot assay was done according to the<br>
manufacturer's instructions (Boehringer Mannheim).<br>
Briefly, the bacterial strains to be tested were dotted<br>
onto a positively charge nylon membrane (Boehringer<br>
Mannheim), dried and then treated as described in the DIG<br>
System's user's guide for colony lifts. pre-<br>
hybridizations and hybridizations were done at 42Â°C with<br>
solutions containing 50% formamide (Sigma) . The pre<br>
hybridization solution also contained 100 mg/ml of<br>
denatured herring sperm DNA (Boehringer Mannheim) as an<br>
additional blocking agent to prevent nonspecific<br>
hybridization of the DNA probe. The stringency washes and<br>
detection steps using the chemiluminescent lumigen PPD<br>
substrate were also done as described in the DIG System'.s<br>
user's guide.<br>
For the 71 Neisseria meningitidis strains tested the<br>
results obtained with monoclonal antibody Me-7 and the 525<br>
base pair DHA. probe were in perfect agreement. According<br>
to the results, all the Neisseria meningitidis strains<br>
tested have the Neisseris meningitidis 22 kDa strrface<br>
protein gene and they express the protein since they were<br>
all recognized by the monoclonal antibody, thus confirming<br>
that this protein is highly conserved among the Neisseria<br>
meningitidis isolates (Table 2).<br>
The DNA probe also detected the gene coding for the<br>
Neiss&amp;rla meningritidis 22 kDa surface protein in all<br>
Neisseria gonorrhceae strains tested.<br>
On the contrary, the monoclonal antibody Me-7 reacted<br>
only with 2 out of the 16 Neisseria gronorrhoeae strains<br>
tested indicating that the specific epitope is somehow<br>
absent, inaccessible or modified in Neisseria gonorrhoeae<br>
strains, or that most of the Neisseria gronorrhoeae strains<br>
do not express the protein even if they have the coding<br>
sequence in their genome (Table 2).<br>
A good correlation between the two detection methods<br>
Was also observed for Neisseria lactamica, since only one<br>
strain of Neisseria lactamica was found to have the gene<br>
without expressing the protein (Table 2) . This result<br>
could also be explained by the same reasons presented in<br>
the last paragraph.<br>
This may indicate that, although the 22kDa is not<br>
expressed, or not accessible on the surface of Neisseria<br>
gonorrhoeas strains, the 22kDs proteincoding gene of the<br>
Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Neisseria lactamica strains may<br>
be used for construction of recombinant plasmids used for<br>
the production of the 22kDa surface protein or analogs.<br>
All such protein or analogs may be used for the<br>
prevention, detection, or diagnosis of Neisseria<br>
meningitidis. More particularly, such infections may be<br>
selected from infections from Neisseria meningitidis,<br>
Neisseria gonozrhoeae, and Neisseria Lactamica Therefore,<br>
the 22kDa surface protein or analogs, may be used for the<br>
manufacture of a vaccine against such infections.<br>
Moreover, the 22kDa protein or analogs, may be used for<br>
the manufacture of a kit for the detection or diagnosis of<br>
such infections.<br>
The results obtained with Moraxella catharralis<br>
strains showed that out of the 5 strains tested, 3 reacted<br>
with monoclonal antibody Meâ7, but none of them reacted<br>
with the DNA probe indicating that the gene coding tor the<br>
Neisseria meningitidis 22 kDa surface protein is absent<br>
from the genome of these strains (Table 2).<br>
Several other Neisserial species as well as other<br>
bacterial species (see footnote, Table 2) were tested and<br>
none of them were found to be positive by any of the two<br>
tests. This latter result seems to indicate that the gene<br>
for the 22 kDa surface protein is shared only among<br>
closely related species of Neisseriacae.<br>
Table 2. Reactivity of the 525 base pair DNA probe and<br>
monoclonal antibody Me-7 with different<br>
Neisseria species<br>
The following Neisserrial species and other bacterial species were aiso tested with the two<br>
assays and gave negative results: 1 Neisseria cinerea, 1 Neisseria 1lava, 1 Neisseria<br>
flavescens, 2 Neisseria mucosa, 4 Neisseria perflava/sicca, 1Neisseria perilava, 1 N.sicca,1<br>
N. subflava, 1 Alcaligenes feacalis (ATCC 8750), 1 Bordetella pertussis (8340), 1 Bordetelle<br>
bronchtseptica, 1 Citrobacter freundii (ATCC 2080), 1 Edwarsiella,tarda (ATCC 15947), 1<br>
Enterobacter cfoaca (ATCC 23355), 1-Enterobacter aenoyenes (ATCCT 13048), 1 Echerichia<br>
coli, 1 Flavobacterium odoratum, 1 Haemophilus influenzae type b (Eagan strain), 1 Klebsiella<br>
pneumoniaÂ© (ATCC 13883), 1 Proteus rettgeri (ATCC 25932), 1 Proteus vulgaris (ATCC<br>
13315), 1 Pseudomonas aetuginosa (ATCC 3027), 1 Salmonella typhimurium (ATCC 14028),<br>
1 Serrati marcescens (ATCC 8100), 1 Shigella flexneri (ATCC .12025), 1 Shigella sonnei<br>
(ATCC 9290),and 1 Xanthomonas maltophila.<br>
In conclusion, the DNA hybridization assay clearly<br>
indicated that the gene coding for the Neisseria<br>
meningitidis 22 kDa surface protein is highly conserved<br>
among the pathogenic Neisseria. Furthermore, the results<br>
obtained clearly showed that this DNA probe could become a<br>
valuable tool for the rapid and direct detection of<br>
pathogenic Neisseria bacteria in clinical specimen. This<br>
probe could even be refined to discriminate between the<br>
Neisseria meningitidis and Veisseria gonorrhoeae.<br>
BXAMPLB 5 Bacteriolytic And protective Properties Of The<br>
Monoclonal Antibodies<br>
The bactexiolytic activity of the purified Neisseria<br>
meningitidis 22 kDa surface protein-specific monoclonal<br>
antibodies was evaluated in vitro according to a method<br>
described previously [Brodeur et al., Infect, Immun., 50,<br>
p. 510 (1985); Martin et al., Infect. Immn., 60, p. 2718<br>
(1992)]. in the presence of a guinea pig serum<br>
complement, purified monoclonal antibodies Me1 and Me7<br>
efficiently killed Neisseria meningitidis strain 608B,<br>
Relatively low concentrations of each of these monoclonal<br>
antibodies reduced by more than 50% the number of viable<br>
bacteria. The utilization of higher concentrations of<br>
purified monoclonal antibodies Me-1 and Me-7 resulted in a<br>
sharp decrease (up. to 99%} in the number of barteril<br>
colony forming units. Importantly, the bacteriolytic<br>
activity of these monoclonal antibodies is complement<br>
dependent, since heatinactivation of the guinea pig serum<br>
for 30 minutes at 56Â°C completely abolished "the killing<br>
activity. The other monoclonal antibodies did not exhibit<br>
significant bacteriolytic activity against the same<br>
strain. The combined, representative results of several<br>
experiments are presented in Figure 7, wherein the results<br>
shown for Me7 are representative and consistent with the<br>
results obtained for Me-1. The results shown for Me-2 are<br>
representative and consistent with the results obtained<br>
for the other monoclonal antibodies Me-3, Me-5 and Meâ6<br>
A mouse model of infection, which was described<br>
previously by one of the inventors [Brodeur et al, Infect.<br>
Immun., 50, p. 510 (1985); Brodeur et al., Can. J.<br>
Microbiol., 32, p. 33 (1986)] was used to assess the<br>
protective activity of each monoclonal antibody. Briefly,<br>
Balb/c mice were injected intraperitoneally with 600 ml of<br>
ascitic fluid containing the monoclonal antibodies 18<br>
hours before the bacterial challenge. The mice were than<br>
challenged with one ml of a suspension containing 1000<br>
colony forming units of Neisseria menigitidis strain<br>
608B, 4% mucin (Sigma) and 1.6% hemoglobin (Sigma). The<br>
combined results of several experiments are presented in<br>
Table 3. It is important to note that only the<br>
bacteriolytic monoclonal antibodies Me-1 and Me-7<br>
protected the mice against experimental Neissenia<br>
meningitidis infection. Indeed, the injection of ascitic<br>
fluid containing these two monoclonal antibodies before<br>
the bacterial challenge significantly increased the rate<br>
of survival of Balb/c mice to 70% or more compared to the<br>
9% observed in the control groups receiving either 600<br>
ial Sp2/0 induced ascitic fluld or 600 ml ascitic fluid<br>
containing unrelated monoclonal antibodies. Results have<br>
also indicated that 80% of the mice survived the infection<br>
if they were previously injected with 400 Âµg of protein A<br>
purified Me-7 18 hours before the bacterial challenge.<br>
Subsequent experiments are presently being done to<br>
determine the minimal antibody concentration necessary to<br>
protect 50% of the mice. Lower survival rates from 20 to<br>
40% were observed for the other Neigseria meningitidis 22<br>
kDa surface proteinspecific monoclonal antibodies.<br>
Table 3. Evaluation of to immumoprotective potential of<br>
the 22 kDa surface proteinspecific monoclonal<br>
antibodies against Neiseeria mmnlngitidis strain<br>
608B (B;2a:p1.2)<br>
In conclusion, the results clearly indicated that an<br>
antibody Specific for the Neisseria meninigitidis 22 kDa<br>
surface protein can efficiently protect mice against an<br>
experimental lethal challenge. The induction of<br>
protective antibodies by an antigen is one of the most<br>
important criteria to justify further research on<br>
potential vaccine candidate.<br>
EXAMPLE 6 Immunization with Purified Recombinant 22 kDa<br>
Surface Protein Confers Protection Against<br>
Subsequent Bacterial Challenge<br>
Purified recombinant 22 kDa surface protein was<br>
prepared according to the protocol presented in Example 3,<br>
and was used to immunize Balb/c mice to determine its<br>
protective effect against challenge with a lethal dose of<br>
Neisseria meningitidis 608B (B:2a;P1.2). It was decided<br>
to use the purified recombinant protein instead of the<br>
native meningococcal protein in order to insure that there<br>
was no other meningococcal antigen in the vaccine<br>
preparation used during these experiments. The mouse<br>
model of infection used in these experiments was described<br>
previously by one of the inventors [Brodeur et a1., Infeo.<br>
Immun., 50, p. 510 (1985); Brodeur et al., Can, J.<br>
Microbiol., 32, p. 33 (1986)]. The mice were each<br>
injected subcutaneously three times at three-week<br>
intervals with 100 ml of the antigen preparation<br>
containing either 10 or 20 Jig per mouse of the purified<br>
recombinant 22 kDa surface protein. QuilA was the<br>
adjuvant used for these experiments at a concentration of<br>
25 Âµg per injection. Mice in the control groups were<br>
injected following the same procedure with either 10 or 20<br>
Âµg of BSA, 20 fig of concentxated culture supernatant of<br>
Escherichia. colx strain BL21(DE3) carrying the plasmid<br>
pWKS30 without the insert gene for the meningococcal<br>
protein prepared as described in Example 3, or phosphate<br>
buffered saline. Serum samples from each, mouse were<br>
obtained before each injection in order to analyze the<br>
development of the immune response against the recombinant<br>
protein. Two weetks following the third immunization the<br>
mice in all groups were injected intraperitoneally with 1<br>
ml of a suspension containing 1000 colony forming units of<br>
Neisseria meningitidis strain S08B in 4% mucin (Sigma) and<br>
1.6% hemoglobin (Sigma) .<br>
The results of these experiments are presented in<br>
Table 4. Eighty percent (80%) of the mice immunized with<br>
the purified recombinant 22 kDa surface protein survived<br>
the bacterial challenge compared to 0 to 42% in the<br>
control groups. Importantly, "the mice in the control<br>
group injected with concentrated Bscherichia coli culture<br>
supernatant were not protected against the bacterial<br>
challenge. This latter result clearly demonstrated that<br>
the components present in the culture media and the<br>
Escherichia coil's antigens that might be present in small<br>
amounts after purification do not contribute to the<br>
observed protection against Neisseria meningitidis.<br>

CONCLUTSION<br>
The injection of purified recombinant 22 kDa surface<br>
protein greatly protected the immunized mice against the<br>
development of a lethal infection by Neisseria<br>
meningitidis <br>
exemlified by murine hybridoma cell lines producing<br>
monoclonal antibodies Me-1 and Me-7 deposited in the<br>
American Type Culture Collection in Roekville, Maryland,<br>
USA on July 21, 1995. The deposits were assigned accession<br>
numbers HB 11959 (Me-l)and HB 11958 (Me-7).<br>
EXAMPLE 7 Sequence analysis of. other strains of<br>
Neisseria meningitidis and of Neisseria.<br>
gonorrhoeae<br>
The 2,75 kb claI digested DNA fragment containing the<br>
gene coding for the 22kDa surface protein was isolated<br>
from the genomic DNA of the different strains of Neisseria<br>
meiningitidis and Neisseria gonorrhoeas as described in<br>
Example 3.<br>
a) MCH88 strain: The nucleotide sequence of strain MCH88<br>
(clinical isolate) is presented in Figure 8 (SEQ ID N0:3).<br>
From experimental evidence obtained from strain 60SB<br>
(Example 3), a putative leader sequence was deduced<br>
corresponding to amino acid 19 to 1 (M-K-K-A-L-A-A-L-I-<br>
A-L-A-L-P-A-A-A-L-A) . A search of established databases<br>
confirmed that 22kDa surface protein from Neisseria.<br>
meningitidis strain MCH 188 (SEQ ID N0:4) or its gene (SEQ<br>
ID NO:3) have not been described previously,<br>
b) Z4063 strain: The nucleotide sequence of strain Z4063<br>
(Wang J.F. et al. Infect. Immun., 60, p.5267 (1992)) is<br>
presented in Figure 9 (SEQ ID WO:5). From experimental<br>
evidence obtained from strain 608B (Example 3), a putative<br>
leader sequence was deduced corresponding to amino acid 19 to 1 (M-K--J-C-A-L-A-T-L-I-A-L-A-L-P-A-A-A-1-A) . A search<br>
of established databases confirmed that 22kDa surface<br>
protein from Neisserist meningitidis strain 24063 (SEQ ID<br>
NO:6) or its gene {SEQ ID NO:5) have not been described<br>
previously.<br>
c) Neisseria gonorrhoeae strain b2: The nucleotide<br>
sequence of Neisseria gonorrhceae strain b2 (serotype 1,<br>
Nat.Ref, Center for Neisseria, LCDC, Ottawa, Canada) is<br>
described in Figure 10 (SEQ ID NO: 7) . From experimental<br>
evidence obtained from strain 608B (Example 3), a putative<br>
leader sequence was deduced corresponding to amino acid 29 po 1 (M-K-k-A-L-A-A-L-I-A-L-A-L-P-A-A-A-L-A) . A search<br>
of established databases confirmed that 22kDa surface<br>
protein from Neisseria gonorrhoeae strain b2 (SEQ ID NO-8)<br>
or its gene (SEQ ID NO:7) have not been described<br>
previously.<br>
Figure 11 shows the consensus sequence established<br>
from the UNA. sequence of all four strains tested. The<br>
MCH88 strain showed an insertion of one codon (TCA) at<br>
nucleotide 217, but in general the four strains showed<br>
striking homology.<br>
Figure 12 depicts the homology between the deduced<br>
aminD acid sequence obtained from the four strains. There<br>
is greater than 90% identity between all four strains.<br>

with the plasmid pN2202 or with the control plasmid pWKS30<br>
(the strain and the plasmids are described in Example 3).<br>
The lithium chloride extraction used to obtain these outer<br>
membrane preparations was performed in a manner previously<br>
described by the inventors [Brodeur et al, Infect. Immun.<br>
50, 510 (1985)]. The protein content of these<br>
preparations were determined by the Lowry method adapted,<br>
to membrane fractions [Lowry et al, J. Biol. Chem. 193,<br>
265 (1951)]. The rabbits were injected subcutaneously and<br>
intramuscularly at several sites twice at three week<br>
intervals with 150 Âµg of one of the outer membrane<br>
preparations described above. QuilA, at a final<br>
concentration of 20% (vol./vol.) (CedarLane Laboratories,<br>
Hornby, Ont., Canada), was the adjuvant used for these<br>
immunizations. The developmentof the specific humoral<br>
response was analyzed by ELISA using outer membrane<br>
preparations extracted from Neisseria meningitidis strain<br>
608B (B:2a:P1.2) as coating antigen and by Western<br>
immunoblotting following methods already described by the<br>
inventors [Brodeur et al., Infect. Immun. 50, 510 (1985) ;<br>
Martin et al, Eur. J. Immunol. 18, 601 (1988)]. Alkaline<br>
phosphatase or peroxydase-labeled Donkey anti-rabbit<br>
immunoglobulins (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West<br>
Grove, PA) were used for these assays.<br>
The injection of E. coli outer membrane preparation<br>
containing the 22 kDa recombinant protein in combination<br>
with QuilA adjuvant induced in the rabbit a strong<br>
specific humoral response of 1/32,000 as determined by<br>
ELISA (Figure 13). The antibodies induced after the<br>
injection of the recombinant 22 kDa protein reacted with<br>
the purified recombinant 22 kDa protein, but more<br>
importantly they also recognized the native protein as<br>
expressed, folded and embedded in the outer membrane of<br>
Neisseria. meningitidis. Western Immunoblotting experiments<br>
clearly indicated that the antibodies present after the<br>
second injection recognized on nitrocellulose membrane the<br>
same protein band as the one revealed by Mab Me-2<br>
(describedin Example 2), wnich is specific for the 22 kDa<br>
protein,<br>
b) Monkeys<br>
Two Macaca fascicularis {cynomolgus) monkeys were<br>
respectively immunized with two injections of 100 Âµg (K28)<br>
and 200 Âµg (I276) of affinity purified recombinant 22 kDa<br>
protein per injection. The methods used to produce and<br>
purify the protein from S. colt strain BL21De3 were<br>
^escribed in Example 3. Alhydrogel, at a final<br>
concentration of 20% (vol./vol.) (edarLane Itaboratories,<br>
Hornby, Ont., Canada), was the adjuvant used for these<br>
immunizations. The mnonkeys received two intramuscular<br>
injections at three weeks interval. A control monkey<br>
(K65) was immunized within unrelated recombinant protein<br>
preparation following the same procedures. The sera were<br>
analyzed as described above. Alkaline phosphatase or<br>
Perorydaselabeled Goat anti-human immunoglobulins<br>
(Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove,. PA) were<br>
used for there accure<br>
The specific antibody response of monkey K28 which<br>
was. immunized with lO0Âµg of purified protein per injection<br>
appeared faster and was stronger than the one observed for<br>
monkey 1276 which was injected with 200ug of protein<br>
(Figure 14). Antibodies specific for the native 22 kDa<br>
protein as detected by western immunoblotting were already<br>
present in the sera of the imaunized monkeys twenty one<br>
days after the first injection, but were .absent in the<br>
sera of the control monkey after two injections of the<br>
control antigen.<br>
Conclusion<br>
The data presented in Examples 2 and 5 clearly showed<br>
that the injection of the recombinant 22 kDa protein can<br>
induce a protective humoral response in mice which is<br>
directed against Neisseria meningitidis strains. More<br>
importantly, the results presented in this example<br>
demonstrate that this immunological response is not<br>
restricted to only one species, but this recombinant<br>
surface protein can also stimulate the immune system of<br>
other species such as rabbit or monkey.<br>
Example 9 Epitope mapping of the 22kDa Naisseria<br>
meningitidis protein<br>
Neisseria meningitidis 22 kDa surface protein was<br>
epitope mapped using a method described by one of the<br>
inventors [Martin et al. Infect. Immun (1991): 59:1457<br>
 1464]. Identification of the linear epitopes was<br>
accomplished using 18 overlapping synthetic peptides<br>
covering the entire Neisseria meninigitidis 22 kDa protein<br>
sequence derived from strain 608B (Figure 15) and<br>
hyperimmune sera obtained after immunization with this<br>
protein. The identification of immunodominant portions on<br>
the 12 kDa protein may be helpful in the design of rtev<br>
efficient vaccines. Furthermore, the localisation of these<br>
E-cell epitopes also provides valuable informatiton about<br>
the structural configuration of the protein in the outer<br>
membrane of Neisserie meninigitidis.<br>
All peptides were synthesized by BioChem immunosystems<br>
Inc. (Montreal, Canada) with the Applied Biosystems<br>
(Foster City, Calif.) automated peptide synthesizer.<br>
Synthetic peptides were purified by reversephase high<br>
pressure .liquid chromatography. Peptides CS-845, CS-847,<br>
CS-848, CS-851, CS-852 and CS-856 (Figure 15} were<br>
solttbilized in a small volume of 6m guanidine-HCl (J.T.<br>
Baker, Ontario, Canada) or dimethyl sulforide (J.T,<br>
Baker) . These peptides were .then adjusted to 1 mg/ml with<br>
distilled water. All the other peptides were freely<br>
soluble in distilled water and were also adjusted to 1<br>
mg/ml.<br>
Peptide enzymelinked immunosorbent assays (ELISA)<br>
were performed by coating synthetic peptides onto<br>
microtitration plates (Immnulon 4, Dynatech Laboratories<br>
Inc., Chantilly, VA) at a concentration of 50 Âµg/ml in 50<br>
mM carbonate buffer, pH 9.6. After overnight incubation<br>
at room temperature, the plates were washed with<br>
phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) containing 0.05% (wt/vol)<br>
Tween 20 (Sigma Chemical Co., St.Louis, Mo.) and blocked<br>
with PBS containing 0.5% (wt/vol) bovine serum albumin<br>
(Sigma] Sera obtained from mice and monkeys immunized<br>
with affinity purified recombinant 22 kDa. surface protein<br>
were diluted and lO0Âµl per well of each dilution were<br>
added to the SLISA plates and incubated for 1 h at 37Â°c.<br>
The plates were washed three times, and 100 Âµl of alkaline<br>
phosphatasecorrjugated goat antimouse or antihuman<br>
immunoglobulins (Jackson immunoResearch Laboratories, West<br>
Grove, PA ) diluted according to the manufacturer's<br>
recommendations was .added After incubation for 1 h at<br>
3700, the plates were washed and 100 Âµl of diethanolamine<br>
(10% (vol/vol), pH 9.8) containing pnitrophenylphosphate<br>
(Sigma) at 1 mg/ml was added. After 60 min., the reaction<br>
(l-410 nm) was read spectrophotometrically with a<br>
microplate reader.<br>
Mouse and monkey antisera obtained after immunization<br>
with affÂ±nity purified recombinant 21 kDa protein (Example<br>
8) were successfully used in combination with eighteen<br>
overlapping synthetic peptides to localize B-cell epitopes<br>
on the protein. These epitopes are clustered within three<br>
antigenic domains on the protein.<br>
The first region is located between amino acid<br>
residues 51 and 86. Computer analysis using different<br>
algorithms suggested that this region has the highest<br>
probability of being immnunologically important since it is<br>
hydrophilic and surface exposed. Furthermore, comparison<br>
of the four protein sequences which is presented in Figure<br>
12 indicates that one of the major variation, which is the<br>
insertion of one amino acid residue at position 73, is<br>
also located in this region.<br>
The antisera identified a second antigenic domain<br>
located between amino acid residues 110 and 140.<br>
Interestingly, the sequence analysis revealed that seven<br>
out of the fourteen amino acid residues that are not<br>
conserved among the lour protein sequences are clustered<br>
within this region of the protein.<br>
A third antigenic domain located in a highly<br>
conserved portion of the protein, between amino acid<br>
residues 31 and 55, was recognized only by the<br>
monkeys sera.<br>
Exanple 10 Heat-inducible expression vector for the<br>
large scale production of the 22 kDa<br>
surface protein<br>
The gene coding for the Neisseria meningitidis 22<br>
kDa surface protein was inserted into the plasmid p629<br>
[George et a1. Bio/technology 5: 600-603 (1987) ] . A<br>
cassette of the bacteriophage l cl857 temperature<br>
sensitive repressor gene, from which the functional Pr<br>
promoter has been deleted, is carried by the plasmid p629<br>
that uses the PL promoter to control the synthesis of the<br>
22kDa surface protein. The inactivation of the CI857<br>
repressor by a temperature shift from 30Â°C to temperatures<br>
above 38Â°C results in the production of the protein<br>
encoded by the plasmid. The induction of gene expression<br>
in E. coll cells by a temperature shift is advantageous<br>
for large scale fermentation since it can easily be<br>
achieved with modern fermentors. Other inducible<br>
expression vectors usually require the addition of<br>
galactoside (IPTG) in the culture media in order to induce<br>
the expression of the desired gene.<br>
A 540 nucleotide fragment was amplified by PCR from<br>
the Nedsseria meningitidis strain. 608B genomic DNA using<br>
the following two oligonucleotide primers (OCRR8: 5'<br>
TAATAGATCTATGAAAAAAGCACTTGCCAC3' and OCRR9: 3'<br>
CACqCGCAGTTTAACTCAG&amp;TTA-5). These primers correspond<br>
to the rmcleotide sequences found at both ends of the 22<br>
kDa gene. To simplify the cloning of the FCR product, a<br>
Bgl II (AGATCT) restriction site was incorporated into the<br>
nucleotide sequence of these primers. The PCR product was<br>
purified on agarose gel before being digested with Bgl II.<br>
This Bgl II fragment of approrimately 525 base pairs was<br>
then inserted into the Bgl II and Bam HI sites of the<br>
plasmid p623. The plasmid containing the PCR product<br>
insert named pNP2204 was used to transform E. coli strain<br>
DH5OF'IQ. A partial map of the plasmid pNP2204 is<br>
presented in Figure 16, The resulting colonies were<br>
screened with Neisseria meningitidis 22 kDa surface<br>
protein specific monoclonal antibodies described in<br>
Example 2. Western blot analysis of the resulting clones<br>
clearly indicated that the protein synthesized by E. coli<br>
was complete and migrated an SDS-PAGE gel like the native<br>
Neisseria meningitidis 22 kDa surface protein. Plasmid<br>
DNA was purified from the selected clone and then<br>
sequenced. The nucleotide sequence of the insert present<br>
in the plasmid perfectly matched the nucleotide sequence<br>
of the gene coding for the Neisseria meningitidis 22 kDa<br>
protein presented in Figure 1.<br>
To study the level of synthesis of the 22 kDa surface<br>
protein, the temperatureinducible plasmid pNF2204 was<br>
used to transform the following E. coli strains: W3110,<br>
JM105, BL21, TOPPl, TOPP2 and T0PP3 The level of<br>
synthesis of the 22 kDa surface protein and the<br>
localization of the protein in the different cellular<br>
fractions were determined for each strain. Shake flask<br>
cultures In LB broth (Gibco BRL, Life Technologies, Grand<br>
Island, NY) indicated that a temperature shift from 3 0Â°C<br>
to 390C efficiently induced the expression of the gene,<br>
Time ocuroc evaluation of the level of synthesis indicated<br>
that the protein appeared, as determined on SDS-PAGE gel,<br>
as soon as 30 min after induction and that the amount of<br>
protein increased constantly during the induction period.<br>
Expression levels between 8 to 10 mg of 22 kDa protein<br>
per liter were determined for E. coll strains W3110 and<br>
TOPPl. For both strains., the majority of the 22 kDa<br>
protein is incorporated in the bacterial outer meesbrane.<br>
Example 11 Purification of the Neisaeria meningitidis<br>
22kDa protein<br>
Since the vast majority of the 22 kDa protein is<br>
found embedded in the outer membrane of E, cell strains,<br>
the purification protocol presented in this Example is<br>
different from the one already described in Example 3<br>
where a large amount of protein was released in the<br>
culture supernatant. An overnight culture incubated, at<br>
3COC of either E. coli strain W3110 or T0PP1 harboring the<br>
plasmid pNP2204 was inoculated in LB broth containing 50<br>
Âµg/ml of Ampicillin (Sigma) and was grown at 30Â°C with<br>
agitation (250 rpm) until it reached a cell density of 0.6<br>
(l=600nm) , at which point the incubation temperature was<br>
shifted to 39Â°C for three to five hours to induce the<br>
production of the protein. The bacterial cells were<br>
harvested by centrifugation at 8,000 xg for 15 minutes at<br>
4Â°C and washed twice in phosphate buffered saline (PBS),<br>
pH 7.3. The bacterial cells were ultrasonically broken<br>
(ballistic disintegration or mechanical disintegration<br>
with a French press may also be used). Unbroken cells<br>
were removed by centrifugation at 5,000 xg for 5 minutes<br>
and discarded. The outer membranes were separated from<br>
cytoplasrnic components by centrifugation at 100,000 xg for<br>
1 h at 10Â°C. The membrane-containing pellets were<br>
resuspended in a small volume of PBS, pH 7.3. To<br>
solubilize the 22 kDa surface protein from the, membranes,<br>
detergents such as Empigen BB (Calbiochem Co., LaJolla,<br>
CA), Zwittergent3,14 (Calbiochem Co.), or b<br>
octylglucoside (Sigma) were used. The detergent was added<br>
to the membrane fraction at final concentration of 31; and<br>
the mixture was incubated for 1 h at 20Â°C. The non<br>
soluble material was removed by centrifugation at 100,000<br>
xg for 1 h at 10Â°C.<br>
The 22 kDa protein was efficiently solubilized by<br>
either three of the detergents, however b-octylglucoside<br>
had the advantage of asily removing several unwanted<br>
membrane proteins since they were not solubilized and<br>
pould be separated from the supernatant by centrifugation.<br>
To remove the detergent, the 22 kDa containing<br>
supernatant was dialyzed extensively against several<br>
changes of PBS buffer proteinase K treatment (as in<br>
Example 1) can be used to further remove unwanted proteins<br>
from the 22kDa surface protein preparation. Differential<br>
precipitation using ammonium sulfate or organic solvents,<br>
and ultrafiltration are two additional steps that can be<br>
used to remove unwanted nucleic acid and<br>
lipopolysaccharide contaminants from the proteins before<br>
gel permeation and ionexchange chromatography can be<br>
efficiently used to obtain the purified 22 kDa protein.<br>
Affinity chromatography, as described in Example 3, can<br>
also be useS to purify the 22 kDa protein.<br>
Example 12 Use of 22kDa surface protein As a Human<br>
Vaccine<br>
To formulate a vaccine for human use, appropriate<br>
22kDa surface protein antigens may be selected from the<br>
polypeptides described herein. For example, one of skill<br>
in the art could design a vaccine around the 22kDa<br>
polypeptide or fragments thereof containing an immunogenic<br>
epitope. The use of molecular biology techniques is<br>
particularly wellsuited for the preparation of<br>
substantially pure recombinant antigens.<br>
The vaccine composition may take a variety of forms.<br>
These include, for example, solid, semisolid, and liguid<br>
dosage forms, such as powders, liquid solutions or<br>
Suspensions, and liposomes. Based on our belief that the<br>
22kDa surface protein antigens of this invention, may<br>
elicit a protective immune response when administered to a<br>
to those used for immunizing humans with other proteins<br>
and polypeptides, e.g. tetanus and diphteria. Therefore,<br>
the compositions of this invention will preferably<br>
comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvant such as<br>
incomplete Freund's adjuvant, aluminum hydroride, a<br>
muramyl _peptide, a water-in-oil emulsion, a liposome, an<br>
ISCOM or CTE, or a non-toxic B subunit form cholera torin.<br>
Most .preferably, the compositions will include a water-in-<br>
oil emulsion or aluminum hydroride as adjuvant.<br>
The composition would be administered to the patient<br>
in any of a number of pharmaceutically acceptable forms<br>
including intramuscular, intradermal, subcutaneous or<br>
topic, Pxeferrably, the vaccine will be administered<br>
intramuscularly.<br>
Generally, the dosage will consist of an initial<br>
injection,most probably with, adjuvant, of about 0.01 to 10<br>
mg, land preferably 0,1 to 1.0 mg of 22kDa surface protein<br>
antigen per patient, followed most probably by one or more<br>
administered at about 1 and 6 months after the intial<br>
injection.<br>
A consideration relating to vaccine development is<br>
the question of mucosal immunity. The ideal mucosel<br>
vaccine will be safely taken orally or intranasally as one<br>
or a few doses and would elicit protective antibodies on<br>
the appropriate surfaces along with systemic inmunity. The<br>
mucosal vaccine coposition may include adjuvants, inert<br>
particulate carriers or recombinant live vectors.<br>
The anti-22kDa surface protein antibodies of this<br>
invention are useful for passive immunotherapy end<br>
immunoprophylaxis of humans infected with Neisseria<br>
meninigitidis or related bacteria such as Neisseria<br>
gonorrhoeae or Neisseria lactamica. The dosage forms and<br>
regimens for such passive immunization would be similar to<br>
those of other passive immunotherapies.<br>
An antibody according to this invention is<br>
exemplified by a hybridoma producing MAbs Me-1 or Me-7<br>
deposited in the American Type Culture Collection in<br>
Rockville, Maryland, USA on July 21, 1995, and identified<br>
as Murine Hybridoma Cell Lines,. Me-1 and Me-7<br>
respectively. These deposits were assigned accession<br>
numbers HB 11959 (Me1) and HB 11958 (Me-7).<br>
While we have described herein a number of<br>
embodiments of this invention, it is apparent that our<br>
basic embodiments may be altered to provide other<br>
embodiments that utilize the compositions and processes of<br>
this invention. Therefore, it will be appreciated that the<br>
scope of this invention includes all alternative<br>
embodiments and variations that are defined in the<br>
foregoing specification and by the claims appended<br>
thereto; and the invention is not to be limited by the<br>
specific embodiments which have been presented Therein by<br>
way of example.<br>
