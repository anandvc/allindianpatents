Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to novel chemical compounds and methods. More particularly, the invention provides novel amino pyrrolopyrazole compounds and their analogs, having protein kinase activity, and methods of synthesizing and using such compounds.<br>
Background<br>
Protein kinases are a family of enzymes that catalyze phosphorylation of the hydroxyl groups of specific tyrosine, serine, or threonine residues in proteins. Typically, such phosphorylation can dramatically change the function of the protein and thus protein kinases can be pivotal in the regulation of a wide variety of cellular process, including metabolism, cell proliferation, cell differentiation, and cell survival. The mechanism of these cellular processes provides a basis for targeting protein kinases to treat disease conditions resulting from or involving disorder of these cellular processes. Examples of such diseases include, but are not limited to, cancer and diabetes.<br>
Protein kinases can be broken into two types, protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) and serine-threonine kinases (STKs). Both PTKs and STKs can be receptor protein kinases or non-receptor protein kinases. PAK is a family of non-receptor STKs. The p21 -activated protein kinase (PAK) family of serine/threonine protein kinases plays important roles in cytoskeletal organization and cellular morphogenesis (Daniels et al., Trends Biochem. Sci. 24: 350-355 (1999); Sells et al., Trends Cell. Biol. 7: 162-167 (1997)). PAK proteins were initially identified by their interaction with the active small GTPases, Cdc42, and Rac, and their homology to yeast kinase Ste20 (Manser et al., Nature 367: 40-46 (1994)). In addition to mediating the regulation of actin cytoskeleton and cell adhesion by Cdc42 and Rac (Daniels et al., Trends Biochem. Sci. 24: 350-355 (1999)), it was determined that some PAK proteins protect cells from apoptosis (Gnesutta et al., J. Biol. Chem. 276: 14414-14419 (2001); Rudel et al., Science 276: 1571-1574 (1997); Schurmann et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 20: 453-461 (2000)); modulate mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase pathways (Bagrodia et al., J. Biol. Chem. 270: 27995-27998 (1995); Brown et al., Curr. Biol. 6: 598-605 (1996); Chaudhary et al., Curr. Biol. 10: 551-554 (2000); Frost et al., EMBO J. 16: 6426-6438 (1997); King et al., Nature 396: 180-183 (1998); Sun et al., Curr. Biol. 10: 281-284 (2000)); mediate T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) signaling (Yablonski et al., EMBO J. 17: 5647-5657 (1998)); and respond to DNA damage (Roig et al., J. Biol. Chem. 274: 31119-31122 (1999)). Through these diverse functions, PAK proteins regulate cell proliferation and migration.<br>
The full-length PAK4 nucleic acid and amino acid sequences are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,013,500 and have been deposited in GenBank under accession numbers AF005046 (mRNA) and AAD01210 (amino acid). Modulation of human PAK4 activity is reported to result in alterations in cellular processes affecting cell growth and adhesion. For example, overexpres'sion of PAK4 in fibroblasts leads to morphological changes that are characteristic of oncogenic transformation through induction of<br>
anchorage-independent growth and inhibition of apoptosis (Gnesutta et al., J. Biol. Chem. 276:14414-14419 (2001); Qu et al., Wo/. Cell. Biol. 21: 3523-2533 (2001)).<br>
PAK4 is an attractive target for developing therapeutic agents effective for use in processes and disorders involving cytoskeletal alterations, such as, for example, cancer.<br>

A "pharmaceutical composition" refers to a mixture of one or more of the compounds described herein, or physiologically/pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, hydrates or prodrugs thereof, with other chemical components, such as physiologically/pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and excipients. The purpose of a pharmaceutical composition is to facilitate administration of a compound to an organism.<br>

(1)	acid addition salts, which can be obtained by reaction of the free base of the parent compound<br>
with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, nitric acid, phosphoric add, sulfuric acid,<br>
and perchloric acid and the like, or with organic acids such as acetic acid, oxalic acid, (D) or (L) malic<br>

"Contacting" refers to bringing a compound of the present teachings and a target PK together in such a manner that the compound can affect the catalytic activity of the PK, either directly, i.e., by interacting with the kinase itself, or indirectly, i.e., by interacting with another molecule on which the catalytic activity of the kinase is dependent. Such "contacting" can be accomplished "in vitro," i.e., in a test tube, a petri dish or the like. In a test tube, contacting may involve only a compound and a PK of interest or it may involve whole cells. Cells may also be maintained or grown in cell culture dishes and contacted with a compound in that environment. In this context, the ability of a particular compound to affect a PK related disorder, i.e., the IC^ of the compound, can be determined before use of compounds in vivo with more complex living organisms is attempted.

Inappropriate catalytic activity can arise as the result of either: (1) PK expression in cells which normally do not express PKs, (2) increased PK expression leading to unwanted cell proliferation, differentiation and/or growth, or, (3) decreased PK expression leading to unwanted reductions in cell proliferation, differentiation and/or growth. Over-activity of a PK refers to either<br>
amplification of the gene encoding a particular PK or production of a level of PK activity which can correlate with a cell proliferation, differentiation and/or growth disorder (that is, as the level of the PK increases, the severity of one or more of the symptoms of the cellular disorder increases). Under-activity is, of course, the converse, wherein the severity of one or more symptoms of a cellular disorder increase as the level of the PK activity decreases.<br>
"Treat", "treating" and "treatment" refer to a method of alleviating or abrogating a PK mediated cellular disorder and/or its attendant symptoms. With regard particularly to cancer, these terms simply mean that the life expectancy of an individual affected with a cancer will be increased or that one or more of the symptoms of the disease will be reduced.<br>
"Organism" refers to any living entity comprised of at least one cell. A living organism can be as simple as, for example, a single eukariotic cell or as complex as a mammal, including a human being.<br>
"Therapeutically effective amount' refers to that amount of the compound being administered which will relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms of the disorder being treated. In reference to the treatment of cancer, a therapeutically effective amount refers to that amount which has at least one of the following effects:<br>

with the cancer.<br>
"Monitoring" means observing or detecting the effect of contacting a compound with a cell expressing a particular PK. The observed or detected effect can be a change in cell phenotype, in the catalytic activity of a PK or a change in the interaction of a PK with a natural binding partner. Techniques for observing or detecting such effects are well-known in the art. The effect is selected from a change or an absence of change in a cell phenotype, a change or absence of change in the catalytic activity of said protein kinase or a change or absence of change in the interaction of said protein kinase with a natural binding partner in a final aspect of this invention.<br>
"Cell phenotype" refers to the outward appearance of a cell or tissue or the biological function of the cell or tissue. Examples, without limitation, of a cell phenotype are cell size, cell growth, cell proliferation, cell differentiation, cell survival, apoptosis, and nutrient uptake and use. Such phenotypic characteristics are measurable by techniques well-known in the art.<br>
"Natural binding partner" refers to a polypeptide that binds to a particular PK in a cell. Natural binding partners can play a role in propagating a signal in a PK-mediated signal transduction process. A change in the interaction of the natural binding partner with the PK can manifest itself as an increased or decreased concentration of the PK/natural binding partner complex and, as a result, in an observable change in the ability of the PKto mediate signal transduction.<br>

(Figure Removed)<br>
Scheme 1 illustrates the synthesis of the intermediate I(H) used to make compounds of formula I. The amino group of the substituted amino acid I(A) is alkylated to give compound I(B). This can typically be done by treating compound I(A) with an alkylating agent in the presence of a base. An activated electrophilic double bond moiety is a commonly used alkylating reagent. A typical reaction condition of alkylating I (A) with an activated electrophilic double bond moiety is to treat I (A) with the activated double bond moiety in the presence of a strong base. Subsequent aqueous work up affords compound I(B). The amino group of compound I(B) is then protected with a boc group to give compound I(C). This can typically be done by treating compound I(B) with Boc agent in the presence of a base. A typical condition is to treat compound I(B) with (Boc)2O in the presence of Me4NOH in MeCN as a solvent. The carboxylic acid group of compound I(C) is then converted into a methyl ester of compound I(D). A typical condition of converting the carboxylic acid group into the methyl ester group is to treat I(C) with methyl iodide in DMF in the presence of a base. Compound I(D) then undergoes an intramolecular aldol condensation to give compound I(F). This can typically be done by treating compound I(D) with a strong base in an aprotic<br>
solvent. A typical condition is to treat compound I(D) with t-BuOK in toluene. Subsequent aqueous workup gives compound I(F). Compound I(F) then undergoes a 2+3 cyclization with a hydrazine moiety to form compound I(G). A typical condition of the cyclization is to reflux compound I(F) with hydrazine and acetic acid in EtOH. The free base pyrazole nitrogen of compound I(G) is then acylated to give compound I(H). A typical condition of the acylation is to treat compound I(G) with chloro ethyl carbonate in THF.<br>
More detailed synthetic conditions of Scheme 1 can be found in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2003/0171357 and PCT Publication WO 02/12242, the disclosure of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Scheme 2 illustrates two routes through which compounds of formula I can be made from intermediate I(H). In the first route of Scheme 2, the ethyl ester protecting group of the pyrazole nitrogen of I(H) is cleaved to give compound II(A). This reaction can typically be carried out by treating the substrate I(H) with a base. A typical reaction condition is to reflux the substrate I(H) in dioxane and DCM in the presence of 2-3 equivalents of LiOH followed by aqueous workup. Compound II(A) undergoes a nucleophilic reaction with an electrophilic R1 moiety to give compound II(B). This nucleophilic reaction can be alkylation, acylation, sulfonylation, reductive amination, and many other reactions that can be carried out for the pyrazole amino group of compound II(A). A typical alkylation condition for the transformation of II(A) to II(B) is to react II(A) with R1-CI in the presence of excess base, such as DMA and TEA at an elevated temperature of 80 - 140 °C, and optionally under microwave radiation. Subsequent aqueous workup gives compound II(B). The Boc group on the pyrrole nitrogen of compound II(B) is then removed to give compound II(C). This can typically be done by treating II(B) with a strong acid. Atypical condition is to treat compound II(B) with 1:1 TFA: DCM at room temperature for two hours. Subsequent aqueous work up affords compound II(C). Alternatively, the transformation of compound II(A) to compound II(C) can be carried out in a single step. The alkylation of compound II(A) and the removal of the boc protecting group of the pyrrole nitrogen can be carried out in an one pot reaction. A typical reaction condition is to mix substrate II(A) with the alkylating reagent R1-CI, excess DMA, one equivalent HCI, in dioxane at an elevated temperature and under microwave radiation. Compound II(C) then undergoes a nucleophilic reaction with an R4 electrophile to give compound I. The nucleophilic reaction can be alkylation, acylation, sulfonylation, reductive amination and other reactions that a secondary alkyl amine can carry out. An acylation reaction of compound II(C) can be carried out by reacting compound II(C) with an acylating R4 moiety. A typical acylation reaction condition is to react II(C) with an isocyanate R4 moiety in the presence of TEA at room temperature. Subsequent aqueous workup gives compound I.<br>
In the second route of Scheme 2, the boc group on the pyrrole nitrogen is removed to give compound III(A). The can typically be carried out by treating compound I(H) with a strong acid. A typical reaction condition is to treat compound I(H) with 4N HCI in dioxane and DCM. Subsequent aqueous workup affords compound III(A). Compound III(A) can then undergoes a nucleophilic reaction with an R4 electrophile give compound III(B). Because the -NH2 group attached to the pyrazole in compound III(A) is less reactive than the pyrrole nitrogen of III(A), the transformation of III(A) to III(B) can be carried out without protecting the pyrazole -NH2 group of compound III(A). The nucleophilic reaction carried out for this transformation can be an alkylation, acylation, sulfonylation, reductive amination. Relative mild reaction conditions are preferred to achieve the reaction selectivity. An acylation reaction of III(A) to give<br>
III(B) is carried out by treating compound III(A) with an acylating reagent in the presence of base. A typical reaction condition is to mix compound III(A) with excess of base, such as DIPEA in DCM and adding the resulting solution to an isocyanate at 0°C. The reaction mixture is held at 0°C for about two hours for the reaction to go complete. Subsequent aqueous workup gives compound III(B).<br>
Selective acylation of the pyrrole nitrogen in the presence of the unprotected -NH2 attached to the pyrazole to obtain compound III(B) can also be done from compound I(H), through the intermediate of III(D). The pyrrole nitrogen of I(H) is deprotected and further acylated to give compound III(D). This can be done by treating compound I(H) with a strong acid, reducing the reaction mixture to a residue and then reacting the residue with an acylating agent. A typical reaction condition is to treat compound I(H) with 4N HCI in dioxane at room temperature for two hours and subsequently remove all solvent. The residue is dissolved and basified by a base such as DIPEA. The resulting solution is then added to triphosgene at 0°C . The reaction mixture is allowed to stir at 0°C for an hour. Subsequent aqueous work up affords compound III(D). The crude compound 111(0) then reacts with a nucleophile to give compound III(B). A typical reaction condition is to mix compound III(D) with a R4 nucleophilic amine moiety in the presence of a non-nucleophilic amine in DCM at room temperature. The reaction mixture is be held at room temperature for about two hours. Subsequent aqueous workup afford compound III(B)<br>
The ethyl ester protecting group on the pyrazole nitrogen of compound III(B) is removed to give the free base compound III(C). This can typically be done by treating compound III(B) with a base. A typical reaction condition is to reflux compound III(B) in dioxane and DCM in the presence of 2-3 equivalents of LiOH. Subsequent aqueous workup affords compound III(C). Compound III(C) then undergoes a nucleophilic reaction with an R1 electrophile moiety. This nucleophilic reaction can be an acylation, alkylation, sulfonylation, reductive amination or one of many other reactions that an amine functionality carries out. A typical alkylation reaction condition is to treating compound III(C) with an alkylating agent such as R1-CI, in the presence of a base such as 2 equivalents of DMA, in a solvent such as NMP, the reaction mixture is then heated under microwave radiation to 140°C for hour hours. Subsequent aqueous workup and purification gives compound of formula I.<br>

Chiral compounds of the invention (and chiral precursors thereof) may be obtained in enantiomerically-enriched form using chromatography, typically HPLC, on an asymmetric resin with a mobile phase consisting of a hydrocarbon, typically heptane or hexane, containing from 0 to 50% isopropanol, typically from 2 to 20%, and from 0 to 5% of an alkylamine, typically 0.1% diethylamine. Concentration of the eluate affords the enriched mixture.<br>
Stereoisomeric conglomerates may be separated by conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art; see, for example, "Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds" by E L Eliel (Wiley, New York, 1994), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
The invention also includes isotopically-labeled compounds of the invention, wherein one or more atoms is replaced by an atom having the same atomic number, but an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes suitable for inclusion in the compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, such as 2H and 3H, carbon,<br>
such as 11C, 13C and 14C, chlorine, such as 36CI, fluorine, such as 18F, iodine, such as 123I and 125I, nitrogen, such as 13N and 16N, oxygen, such as 15O, 17O and 18O, phosphorus, such as 32P, and sulfur, such as 35S. Certain isotopically-labeled compounds of the invention, for example, those incorporating a radioactive isotope, are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution studies. The radioactive isotopes tritium, 3H, and carbon-14, 14C, are particularly useful for this purpose in view of their ease of incorporation and ready means of detection. Substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium, 2H, may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example, increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements, and hence may be preferred in some circumstances. Substitution with positron emitting isotopes, such as 11C, 18F, 15O and 13N, can be useful in Positron Emission Topography (PET) studies for examining substrate receptor occupancy.<br>
Isotopically-labeled compounds of the invention can generally be prepared by conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art or by processes analogous to those described herein, using an appropriate isotopically-labeled reagent in place of the non-labeled reagent otherwise employed.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable solvates in accordance with the invention include those wherein the solvent of crystallization may be isotopically substituted, e.g. D2O, d6-acetone, d6-DMSO.<br>
Compounds of the invention intended for pharmaceutical use may be administered as crystalline or amorphous products, or mixtures thereof. They may be obtained, for example, as solid plugs, powders, or films by methods such as precipitation, crystallization, freeze drying, spray drying, or evaporative drying. Microwave or radio frequency drying may be used for this purpose.<br>
The compounds can be administered alone or in combination with one or more other compounds of the invention, or in combination with one or more other drugs (or as any combination thereof). Generally, they will be administered as a formulation in association with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. The term "excipient" is used herein to describe any ingredient other than the compound(s) of the invention. The choice of excipient will to a large extent depend on factors such as the particular mode of administration, the effect of the excipient on solubility and stability, and the nature of the dosage form.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for the delivery of compounds of the invention and methods for their preparation will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. Such compositions and methods for their preparation can be found, for example, in 'Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences', 19th Edition (Mack Publishing Company, 1995), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Oral Administration<br>

Such formulations may be used as fillers in soft or hard capsules and typically include a carrier, for example, water, ethanol, polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, methylcellulose, or a suitable oil, and one or more emulsifying agents and/or suspending agents. Liquid formulations may also be prepared by the reconstitution of a solid, for example, from a sachet.<br>
The compounds of the invention may also be used in fast-dissolving, fast-disintegrating dosage forms such as those described in Expert Opinion in Therapeutic Patents, H (6), 981-986 by Liang and Chen (2001), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
For tablet dosage forms, depending on dose, the drug may make up from 1 wt% to 80 wt% of the dosage form, more typically from 5 wt% to 60 wt% of the dosage form. In addition to the drug, tablets generally contain a disintegrant. Examples of disintegrants include sodium starch glycolate, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, calcium carboxymethyl cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, crospovidone, polyvinylpyrrolidone, methyl cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, lower alkyl-substituted hydroxypropyl cellulose, starch, pregelatinized starch and sodium alginate. Generally, the disintegrant will comprise from 1 wt% to 25 wt%, preferably from 5 wt% to 20 wt% of the dosage form.<br>
Binders are generally used to impart cohesive qualities to a tablet formulation. Suitable binders include microcrystalline cellulose, gelatin, sugars, polyethylene glycol, natural and synthetic gums, polyvinylpyrrolidone, pregelatinized starch, hydroxypropyl cellulose and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose. Tablets may also contain diluents, such as lactose (monohydrate, spray-dried monohydrate, anhydrous and the like), mannitol, xylitol, dextrose, sucrose, sorbitol, microcrystalline cellulose, starch and dibasic calcium phosphate dihydrate.<br>

Tablet blends may be compressed directly or by roller to form tablets. Tablet blends or portions of blends may alternatively be wet-, dry-, or melt-granulated, melt congealed, or extruded before tabletting. The final formulation may include one or more layers and may be coated or uncoated; or encapsulated.<br>
The formulation of tablets is discussed in detail in "Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms: Tablets, Vol. 1", by H. Lieberman and L Lachman, Marcel Dekker, N.Y., N.Y., 1980 (ISBN 0-8247-6918-X), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
Solid formulations for oral administration may be formulated to be immediate and/or modified release. Modified release formulations include delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted and programmed release.<br>
Suitable modified release formulations are described in U.S. Patent No. 6,106,864. Details of other suitable release technologies such as high energy dispersions and osmotic and coated particles can be found in Verma et al, Pharmaceutical Technology On-line, 25(2), 1-14 (2001). The use of chewing gum to achieve controlled release is described in WO 00/35298. The disclosures of these references are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. Parenteral Administration<br>
The compounds of the invention may also be administered directly into the blood stream, into muscle, or into an internal organ. Suitable means for parenteral administration include intravenous, intraarterial, intraperitoneal, intrathecal, intraventricular, intraurethral, intrasternal, intracranial, intramuscular and subcutaneous. Suitable devices for parenteral administration include needle (including microneedle) injectors, needle-free injectors and infusion techniques.<br>
Parenteral formulations are typically aqueous solutions which may contain excipients such as salts, carbohydrates and buffering agents (preferably to a pH of from 3 to 9), but, for some applications, they may be more suitably formulated as a sterile non-aqueous solution or as a dried form to be used in conjunction with a suitable vehicle such as sterile, pyrogen-free water.<br>
The preparation of parenteral formulations under sterile conditions, for example, by lyophilization, may readily be accomplished using standard pharmaceutical techniques well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
The solubility of compounds of the invention used in the preparation of parenteral solutions may be increased by the use of appropriate formulation techniques, such as the incorporation of solubility-enhancing agents.<br>
Formulations for parenteral administration may be formulated to be immediate and/or modified release. Modified release formulations include delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted and programmed release. Thus compounds of the invention may be formulated as a solid, semi-solid, or thixotropic liquid for administration as an implanted depot providing modified release of the active compound. Examples of such formulations include drug-coated stents and PGLA microspheres. Topical Administration<br>
The compounds of the invention may also be administered topically to the skin or mucosa, that is, dermally or transdermally. Typical formulations for this purpose include gels, hydrogels, lotions, solutions, creams, ointments, dusting powders, dressings, foams, films, skin patches, wafers, implants, sponges, fibers, bandages and microemulsions. Liposomes may also be used. Typical carriers include alcohol, water, mineral oil, liquid petrolatum, white petrolatum, glycerin, polyethylene glycol and propylene glycol. Penetration enhancers may be incorporated; see, for example, J Pharm Sci, 88 (10), 955-958 by Finnin and Morgan (October 1999). Other means of topical administration include delivery by electroporation, iontophoresis, phonophoresis, sonophoresis and microneedle or needle-free (e.g. Powderject™, Bioject™, efc.) injection. The disclosures of these references are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.<br>

The compounds of the invention can also be administered intranasally or by inhalation, typically in the form of a dry powder (either alone, as a mixture, for example, in a dry blend with lactose, or as a mixed component particle, for example, mixed with phospholipids, such as phosphatidylcholine) from a dry powder inhaler or as an aerosol spray from a pressurized container, pump, spray, atomizer (preferably an atomizer using electrohydrodynamics to produce a fine mist), or nebulizer, with or without the use of a suitable propellant, such as 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane or 1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoropropane. For intranasal use, the powder may include a bioadhesive agent, for example, chitosan or cyclodextrin.<br>
The pressurized container, pump, spray, atomizer, or nebulizer contains a solution or suspension of the compound(s) of the invention comprising, for example, ethanol, aqueous ethanol, or a suitable alternative agent for dispersing, solubilizing, or extending release of the active, a propellant(s) as solvent and an optional surfactant, such as sorbitan trioleate, oleic acid, or an oligolactic acid.<br>
Prior to use in a dry powder or suspension formulation, the drug product is micronized to a size suitable for delivery by inhalation (typically less than 5 microns). This may be achieved by any appropriate comminuting method, such as spiral jet milling, fluid bed jet milling, supercritical fluid processing to form nanoparticles, high pressure homogenisation, or spray drying.<br>
Capsules (made, for example, from gelatin or HPMC), blisters and cartridges for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated to contain a powder mix of the compound of the invention, a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch and a performance modifier such as /-leucine, mannitol, or magnesium stearate. The lactose may be anhydrous or in the form of the monohydrate, preferably the latter. Other suitable excipients include dextran, glucose, maltose, sorbitol, xylitol, fructose, sucrose and trehalose.<br>
A suitable solution formulation for use in an atomizer using electrohydrodynamics to produce a fine mist may contain from 1µg to 20mg of the compound of the invention per actuation and the actuation volume may vary from 1µL to 100µL. A typical formulation includes a compound of the invention, propylene glycol, sterile water, ethanol and sodium chloride. Alternative solvents which may be used instead of propylene glycol include glycerol and polyethylene glycol.<br>
Suitable flavors, such as menthol and levomenthol, or sweeteners, such as saccharin or saccharin sodium, may be added to those formulations of the invention intended for inhaled/intranasal administration.<br>
Formulations for inhaled/intranasal administration may be formulated to be immediate and/or modified release using, for example, poly(DL-lactic-coglycolic acid (PGLA). Modified release formulations include delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted and programmed release.<br>
In the case of dry powder inhalers and aerosols, the dosage unit is determined by means of a valve which delivers a metered amount. Units in accordance with the invention are typically arranged to administer a metered dose or "puff1 containing a desired mount of the compound of the invention. The<br>
overall daily dose may be administered in a single dose or, more usually, as divided doses throughout the<br>
day.<br>
Rectal/lntravaginal Administration<br>
Compounds of the invention may be administered rectally or vaginally, for example, in the form of a suppository, pessary, or enema. Cocoa butter is a traditional suppository base, but various alternatives may be used as appropriate.<br>
Formulations for rectal/vaginal administration may be formulated to be immediate and/or modified release. Modified release formulations include delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted and programmed release. Ocular Administration<br>
Compounds of the invention may also be administered directly to the eye or ear, typically in the form of drops of a micronized suspension or solution in isotonic, pH-adjusted, sterile saline. Other formulations suitable for ocular and aural administration include ointments, biodegradable (e.g. absorbable gel sponges, collagen) and non-biodegradable (e.g. silicone) implants, wafers, lenses and particulate or vesicular systems, such as niosomes or liposomes. A polymer such as crossed-linked polyacrylic acid, polyvinylalcohol, hyaluronic acid, a cellulosic polymer, for example, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose, or methyl cellulose, or a heteropolysaccharide polymer, for example, gelan gum, may be incorporated together with a preservative, such as benzalkonium chloride. Such formulations may also be delivered by iontophoresis.<br>
Formulations for ocular/aural administration may be formulated to be immediate and/or modified release. Modified release formulations include delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted, or programmed release. Other Technologies<br>
Compounds of the invention may be combined with soluble macromolecular entities, such as cyclodextrin and suitable derivatives thereof or polyethylene glycol-containing polymers, in order to improve their solubility, dissolution rate, taste-masking, bioavailability and/or stability for use in any of the aforementioned modes of administration.<br>
Drug-cyclodextrin complexes, for example, are found to be generally useful for most dosage forms and administration routes. Both inclusion and non-inclusion complexes may be used. As an alternative to direct complexation with the drug, the cyclodextrin may be used as an auxiliary additive, i.e. as a carrier, diluent, or solubilizer. Most commonly used for these purposes are alpha-, beta- and gamma-cyclodextrins, examples of which may be found in PCT Publication Nos. WO 91/11172, WO 94/02518 and WO 98/55148, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. • Dosage<br>
The amount of the active compound administered will be dependent on the subject being treated, the severity of the disorder or condition, the rate of administration, the disposition of the compound and the discretion of the prescribing physician. However, an effective dosage is typically in the range of about 0.001 to about 100 mg per kg body weight per day, preferably about 0.01 to about 35 mg/kg/day, in single or divided doses. For a 70 kg human, this would amount to about 0.07 to about 7000 mg/day, preferably about<br>
0.7 to about 2500 mg/day. In some instances, dosage levels below the lower limit of the aforesaid range may be more than adequate, while in other cases still larger doses may be used without causing any harmful side effect, with such larger doses typically divided into several smaller doses for administration throughout the day.<br>
Kit-of-Parts<br>
Inasmuch as it may desirable to administer a combination of active compounds, for example, for the purpose of treating a particular disease or condition, it is within the scope of the present invention that two or more pharmaceutical compositions, at least one of which contains a compound in accordance with the invention, may conveniently be combined in the form of a kit suitable for coadministration of the compositions. Thus the kit of the invention includes two or more separate pharmaceutical compositions, at least one of which contains a compound of the invention, and means for separately retaining said compositions, such as a container, divided bottle, or divided foil packet. An example of such a kit is the familiar blister pack used for the packaging of tablets, capsules and the like.<br>
The kit of the invention is particularly suitable for administering different dosage forms, for example, oral and parenteral, for administering the separate compositions at different dosage intervals, or for titrating the separate compositions against one another. To assist compliance, the kit typically includes directions for administration and may be provided with a memory aid.<br>

Biological testing, Ki data and cellular assay data<br>
Cloning, expression, and purification of recombinant PAK4 Kinase domain (PAK4 KD): The cDNA coding for PAK4 was amplified from the EST clone (#12) (purchased from Research Genetics) by using PCR. P33 (ACATATG TCC CATGAGCAGT TCCGGGCTGC CCTGCAGCT) and P34 (CTCA TGGGTGCTTC AGCAGCTCGG CTGCCGTGGC) were used as the 5' primer and 3' primer in PCR respectively. The PCR amplified product was cloned into Topo vector (Invitrogen Inc.), and verified by DNA sequencing. PAK4 KD was then subcloned into expression plasmid pET28a(+), pET24a(+), or PGST4.5. The recombinant plasmids containing PAK4 KD was transformed into BL21(DE3) cells for recombinant protein expression. The production of PAK4 KD was induced at 27°C by the addition of IPTG into the cells. The cells were then harvested and lyzed for protein purification. Ni-NTA column (pET28a(+), pET24a(+)) and glutathione column (pGST4.5) were used for the purification. The purified protein was then subjected to thrombin to cleave the N-terminal tags that were inherited from the expression plasmids, and thus gave the PAK4 KD that were used for the Ki assay of this invention.<br>
PAK4 kinase domain enzymatic assay conditions: the enzymatic activity of PAK4 KD was measured by its ability to catalyze the transfer of a phosphate residue from a nucleoside triphosphate to an amino acid side chain of a commercially available peptide (amino acid sequence EVPRRKSLVGTPYWM). The conversion of ATP to ADP accompanies the catalytic reaction. The PAK4 KD catalyzed production of ADP from ATP was coupled to the oxidation of NADH through the activities of pyruvate kinase (PK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). The conversion of NADH to NAD+ is monitored by the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm (e340 = 6.22 cm~1mM"1) using a Molecular Devices SPECTRAMAX 190 in conjunction with the Biomec FX. Typical reaction solutions contain 2 mM<br>
phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.35 mM NADH, 10 mM MgCI2, 1 mM DTT, 0.4mM peptide (EVPRRKSLVGTPYWM) 0.04 mM ATP, 1 units/mL PK, 1 units/ml LDH, 0.01% Tween 20 in 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5. Assays are initiated with the addition of 25nM PAK4 KD. The PAK KD Ki of each compound of the invention (the inhibitor) was calculated based on multiple of Percent Inhibition numbers of the inhibitor at different inhibitor concentrations. The peptide (amino sequence EVPRRKSLVGTPYWM) was purchased from American Peptide Company. NADH, MgCI2, HEPES, DTT, ATP and PK/LDH were purchased from Sigma. Tween 20 was purchased from Calbiochem.<br>
A sandwich ELISA method was used to measure the PAK4 kinase activity in whole cells. The level of PAK4-dependent phosphorylation of GEF-H1b.can be determined by monitoring the binding of a phosphospecific antibody to GEF-H1b. A modified HEK 293 cell line is used in the bioassay and it has been engineered to overexpress both GEF-H1b and the kinase domain (KD) of PAK4. The KD of PAK4 is inducible in this cell line by tetracycline (Trex system, Invitrogen). The name of this cell line has been designated TR-293-KDG. To establish a phosphorylation event on GEF-H1, cells are induced with doxycycline to express the PAK4 KD. Negative control wells do not receive induction. Candidate substance effect is measured as the ability to block this phosphorylation event.<br>
ELISA plate was prepared by pre-coating the plates with a capture antibody (a-HA-tag mouse monoclonal anitibody), blocked with BSA, and washed in 0.1% tween 20 in tris-buffered saline (TBST). Tissue culture plates (precoated with poly-D-lysine) were seeded with TR-293-KDG cells. The TR-293-KDG Cells were induced to express the PAK4 KD with doxycycline overnight and subsequently &amp; concomitantly treated with candidate substances or diluent for an additional 3-hour, continuous exposure. Cells were then lysed with a modified RIPA buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors. The fresh whole cell lysates were then added to the ELISA plate for 2-hours. Between all subsequent steps plates were washed 4 times with TBST. Detection antibody (recognizing the phospho-specific eptitope on GEF-H1b) was added for 1 hour, followed by addition of an enzyme linked goat α-rabbit secondary antibody for 45 minutes. Color development of the enzyme-linked antibody was performed with a peroxidase substrate, ABTS (Moss, Inc.) with absorbance at 405nM read with a spectrophotometer after 30 minute incubation. EC50 values were calculated by sigmoid curve fitting using a four-parameter analysis. PAK4 Kinase Domain Ki data and PAK4 cellular assay EC50 data of the compounds of Examples 1-86: <br>
