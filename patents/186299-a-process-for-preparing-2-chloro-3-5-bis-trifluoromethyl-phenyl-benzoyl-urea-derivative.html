				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a novel 2-chloro-3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)-phenyl benzoyl urea derivative that exhibits potent growth-retarding activity against insect pests. More specifically, the present invention relates to a novel 2-chloro-3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl benzoyl urea derivative represented by the following formula (I) :<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
in which<br>
A	represents N or CH, and<br>
X1   and  X2   independently   of one   another  represent   hydrogen,   fluoro,   chloro   or<br>
bromo.<br>
The present invention also relates to a process for preparing the compound of formula (I) and. a pesticidal composition that includes the compound of formula (I) as an active ingredient.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Before the present invention was made, several benzoyl urea compounds<br>
that inhibit formation of chitin had been developed, including the well known<br>
commercial pesticide, N-(2,6-dichlorobenzoyl)-N'-(4-chloro- or 3,4-dichIoro-phenyl)<br>
urea.	European Patent Publication Nos. 093,976 and 093,977 disclose<br>
3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl  benzoyl   urea  derivatives  whose  structures  are  similar to  that of the  present  invention.       However,  they  exhibit weak pesticidal  activity<br>
against Diamond backmoth even at concentrations as high as Ippm. International Publication No. WO 94/03066 teaches a benzoyl ureido pyridyl phenyl ether derivative, which is undesirable because it can be prepared only by means of an intricate and expensive process. European Patent Publication No. 232,080 discloses a 2,5-difluoro-4-chlorophenyl benzoyl urea derivative whose LCso value against Tobacco cutworm ranges from 0.3 to 0.4ppm.<br>
The benzoyl urea derivatives of the prior art thus exhibited weak pesticidal activity only against certain pests, or could be prepared only by means of complicated and uneconomic processes.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
The present inventors had long endeavored to develop a novel benzoyl urea derivative which can be prepared simply and economically and which exhibits pesticidal activity superior to those of existing pesticides that inhibit chitin formation.<br>
The present inventors have discovered that the novel compound of the present invention, 2-chloro-3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl benzoyl urea, exhibits pesticidal activity that is suprisingly 25 to 50 times more potent than that of 2-bromo-3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl benzoyl urea, which is the subject compound of the International Publication No. WO 95/33711 of the present applicant.<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a novel benzoyl urea derivative represented by the following formula (I) : <br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
in which<br>
A	represents N or CH, and<br>
X1   and   X2   independently   of one   another  represent  hydrogen,   fluoro,   chloro   or<br>
bromo.<br>
It   is   another  object   of the   present   invention   to   provide   a  process   for preparing the novel benzoyl urea derivative of formula (I) :<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
in which<br>
A	represents N or CH, and<br>
X1   and   X2   independently   of one   another  represent   hydrogen,   fluoro,   chloro   or<br>
bromo,   characterized   in   that   a   benzoyl   isocyanate   represented   by   the   following<br>
formula (II) :<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
in     which     A,     X1     and    X2    are     as    previously     defined,     is    reacted    with 2-chloro-3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)aniline represented by the following formula (III) :<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
in the presence of a diluent.<br>
It   is  yet  another  object  of the  present  invention  to  provide  a  pesticidal<br>
Composition comprising the benzyol urea derivative of formula (I) as an active ingredient and an agriculturally acceptable carrier.<br>

(Formula Removed)<br>
in which<br>
A	represents N or CH, and<br>
X1 and X2 independently of one another represent hydrogen, fluoro, chloro or<br>
bromo.<br>
The compounds represented by formula (I) wherein A represents N or CH, X1 represents fluoro, chloro or bromo, and X2 represents hydrogen, fluoro or chloro are particularly preferred.<br>
Examples of the compound represented by formula (I) include :<br>
1-[2-chloro-3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-3-(2,6-difluorobenzoyl) urea. 1-[2-chloro-3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-3-(2-fluorobenzoyl) urea. 1-[2-chloro-3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-3-(2-chlorobenzoyl) urea. 1-[2-chloro-3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-3-(2-chloronicotinoyl) urea. 1-[2-chloro-3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-3-(2,6-dichlorobenzoyl) urea. 1-[2-chloro-3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-3-(2-bromobenzoyl) urea.The present invention also relates to a process for preparing the compound of formula (I), wherein the benzoyl isocyanate of formula (II) is reacted with 2-chloro-3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)aniline in a suitable diluent, according to the following reaction scheme A :<br>
Reaction Scheme A<br>
(Scheme  Removed)<br>
In reaction scheme A,    A, X   and X" are as previously defined.<br>
In the reaction of the compound of formula (II) with the compound of formula (III) according to the present invention, any inert organic solvent may be used as a diluent unless it adversely affects the reaction. Diluents suitable for this reaction include optionally chlorinated aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, xylene, methylene chloride, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, 1,2-dichIoroethane or chlorobenzene; ethers such as diethylether, dibutylether, tetrahydrofuran or dioxane; ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isopropyl ketone or methyl isobutyl ketone; and nitriles such as acetonitrile or propionitrile. The reaction can be generally carried out under normal pressure at temperature ranging from 0 to 120"C, and preferably<br>
In this reaction, the reactants are preferably used in equimolar amounts. Although an excess of any one of the reactants may be used, this is not economically advantageous on either an industrial scale or a laboratory scale.<br>
The reaction is practiced at the temperature as defined above by stirring the reactants and the inert diluent for at least 2 hours and then filtering the resulting product in vacuo. The solid obtained after filtration is washed with the diluent used in the previous step or with an alcohol such as methanol, dried, and then recrystallized, if desired, to produce the pure benzoyl urea compound. The product thus obtained is crystalline and has a definite melting point.<br>
The benzoyl isocyanate compound of formula (II) used in the above reaction as the starting material may be prepared by reacting the substituted benzamide or nicotinamide represented by the following formula (IV) with an oxalyl chloride according to well-known processes (see J. Org. Chem. 27, 3742 (1962) or J. Pesticide Sci., 17, 7 (1992)).<br>
 (Formula Removed)<br>
In formula (IV), A, X1 and X2 are as previously defined.<br>
The 2-chloro-3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)aniline of formula (III) used in the above reaction as a reactant may be prepared according to the known process as depicted in the following reaction scheme B. That is, it may be prepared by reacting 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)aniline represented by the following formula (V) with chlorine gas or N-chlorosuccinimide.<br>
Reaction Scheme B<br>
 (Scheme  Removed)<br>
After the above Chlorination reaction has gone to completion, the product may be separated and purified by means of well-known methods, such as recrystallization, chromatography, etc.<br>

The 2-chloro-3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl benzoyl urea derivatives of the present invention prepared according to the procedures described in the above examples show excellent preventive activity against pests and plant-parasitic insects such as Diamond-back moth (Plutella xylostella), Tobacco cutworm (Spodoptera litura*), and Fall army worm (Spodoptera frugiperdd). Their pesticidal activity can be determined by the following experiments.<br>
The pesticidal compositions used in the experiments described below can<br>
be prepared in a variety of formulations according to their purposes.	For<br>
convenience,   the   compound   of  the   present   invention   was   mixed   with   suitable amounts of surfactant,  water,  and acetone to produce a test preparation containing<br>
the test compound in a predetermined concentration. The compound was first tested at a concentration of 250ppm, and if that concentration was 100% lethal, the concentration was gradually decreased until 50% of the pests were survived (i.e., LCso value).<br>
In order to confirm the strong pesticidal activity of the present compound, the LCso value of the compound according to the present invention was compared with that of the widely-used comparative compounds described in the following Table 2.<br>
Table 2.<br>
(Table  Removed)<br>
Experiment 1<br>
Test for pesticidal activity against Diamond backmoth (Plutella xvlostelld)<br>
Round disks of diameter 5cm were cut from fresh cabbage leaves.       25mg<br>
of the test compound was dissolved in lOOmi of a mixture containing acetone and<br>
aqueous triton-X 100 solution (lOOppm) in the ratio of 1:9 (v/v) to produce a test<br>
preparation containing the test compound in the concentration of 250ppm. The<br>
cabbage leaf disks were dipped into the test preparation for 30 seconds and then<br>
dried in a hood. The dried cabbage leaf disks were put into a disposable petri<br>
dish of diameter 5cm, into which 20 three-aged larvae of Diamond backmoth<br>
(Plutella xylostelld) were inoculated using a fine brush.	The dish was then<br>
tightly sealed with a lid in order to prevent the escape of larvae.<br>
The contents of the petri dish were maintained at 25 °C and 60% humidity. Abnormal growth of Diamond-back moth and lethality of each test compound were examined after 120 hours, and the lethality thus determined at a concentration of 250ppm is given in the following Table 3.<br>

Experiment 2<br>
Test for pesticidal activity against Tobacco cutworm (Spodoptera liturd)<br>
Round disks of diameter 5cm were cut from fresh cabbage leaves. 25mg of the test compound was dissolved in 100m£ of a mixture containing acetone and aqueous triton-X 100 solution (lOOppm) in a ratio of 1:9 (v/v) in order to obtain a test preparation of 250ppm. The cabbage leaf disks were dipped into the test preparation for 30 seconds and then dried in a hood. The dried cabbage leaf disks were put into a disposable petri dish of diameter 5cm, into which 20 three-aged larvae of Tobacco cutworm (Spodoptera liturd) were inoculated using a fine brush. The dish was then tightly sealed with a lid in order to prevent the escape, of larvae.<br>
The contents of the petri dish were maintained at 25 °C and 60% humidity. Abnormal growth of Tobacco cutworm and lethality of each test compound were examined after 120 hours, and the lethality thus determined at a concentration of 250ppm is given in the following Table 5.<br>

Experiment 3<br>
Test for pesticidal activity against Fall army worm (Spodoptera frugiperdd)<br>
Round disks of diameter 5cm were cut from fresh cabbage leaves. 25mg of the test compound was dissolved in 50m£ of a mixture containing acetone and aqueous triton-X 100 solution (lOOppm) in a ratio of 1:9 (v/v) in order to obtain a test preparation of 500ppm. The cabbage leaf disks were dipped into the test preparation for 30 seconds and then dried in a hood. The dried cabbage leaf disks were put into a disposable petri dish of diameter 5cm, into which 20<br>
three-aged larvae of Fall army worm (Spodoptera frugiperdd) were inoculated using a fine brush. The dish was then tightly sealed with a lid in order to prevent the escape of larvae.<br>
The contents of the petri dish were maintained at 25 °C and 60% humidity. Abnormal growth of Fall army worm and lethality of each test compound were examined after 7 days. In case 100% of lethality was shown, concentration was gradually decreased to 0.1 ppm. The lethality of each test compound at each of several concentrations is given in the following Table 7.<br>

As can be seen from the above experimental results, the benzoyl urea derivative according to the present invention exhibits a pesticidal activity against Diamond backmoth and Tobacco cutworm that is more than 500 times that of diflubenzuron (comparative compound A), which is the most widely-used pesticide that inhibits chitin formation. The benzoyl urea derivative according to the present invention also shows a pesticidal activity superior to that of chlorofluazuron (comparative compound B) and a pesticidal activity against Diamond backmoth and Tobacco cutworm 25 to 50 times that of comparative compound (C), which has a structure similar to that of compounds (A) and (B). As can also be seen from Table 7 above, the compound (1) of the present invention shows an unexpected high lethality of 100% against Fall army worm at a concentration of 0.1 ppm, which is 100 times greater than that of the comparative compound (C). The compound of the present invention has the added advantage<br>
of being much more economical to prepare due to the simplicity of its preparation process.<br><br><br><br><br>
