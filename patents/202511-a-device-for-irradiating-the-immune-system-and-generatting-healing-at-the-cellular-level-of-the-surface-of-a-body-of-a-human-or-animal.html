				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention is a device for irradiating the immune system and generating healing at the cellular level of the surface of a body of a human or animal.<br>
The present invention is directed towards the use of electromagnetic radiation to heal and treat various ailments including cancer, particularly to the use of a non laser beam of infrared radiation.<br>
A wide variety of uses of infrared radiation, whether laser or nonlaser, to treat various medical ailments are known in the art. Most of the art involves either therapeutic heating of tissue or laser oriented removal of tissue. Other uses of radiation involve thermal coagulation of blood and similar applications. The use of chemical agents in immuno therapy is also well known. What is needed is a low power infrared device and method to stimulate the immune system to promote normal and expedited healing and to generate healing at the cellular level without harm to normal tissue.<br>
In one aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of assisting the healing of various human infirmities by generating healing at the cellular level comprising the steps of: locating a source of electromagnetic radiation adjacent a surface of a human body and adjacent location of an infirmity; and operating the source at a predetermined level to stimulate the immune system without significant effect on normal cells of the body. The method includes the step of; directing infrared radiation. Other steps include directing infrared radiation having a wavelength of approximately 1917nm; pulsing the radiation applied at a rate of 7.5 hz; and directing radiation in the form of a non-coherent radiation beam. The method also includes the step of: directing infrared radiation having a wavelength in the range of approximately 1800-2400nm. Further aspects of the invention include the steps of: creating infrared radiation from a laser<br>
2<br><br>
source; and directing the radiation through a guide before directing the radiation onto the surface of the body. An additional step includes locating the source at a second location on the surface of the body separated away from a location adjacent an infirmity for stimulating the immune system at the second location.<br>
In other aspects of the present invention there is provided a device for stimulating the human immune system to assist in the healing of an ailment comprising first means for generating electromagnetic radiation and second means for directing the radiation onto the surface of a body adjacent the location of an ailment to be healed. The first means includes circuit means for generating infrared radiation. The circuit means includes laser diode circuit means for generating a beam of infrared radiation. The second means includes guide means for directing the beam onto the surface of a body. In other aspect of the invention the first means includes  infrared<br>
radiation generating means for generating radiation at a wavelength<br>
of approximately 1800-2040 nm.  The radiation is generated to  have<br><br>
a power peak at a wavelength of approximately 1917nm. Additionally,<br>
the  first  means  includes pulse control  means  to  generate  the<br>
radiation at a selectable pulse rate. The pulse rate is approximately 7.5hz.<br>
In  a  final aspect of the present invention there  is  provided  a <br>
device for stimulating the human immune system to assist in the healing of an ailment comprising first means for generating a. beam of infrared radiation having a wavelength of approximately 1917nm, control circuit means for selectively controlling the rate at which the beam is generated by the first means.<br>

Fig. 1 is a functional block diagram of the components of  the device  in accord with the present invention;<br>
Fig. 2 is a graph of the signal strength and frequency for the<br>
infrared beam created by the present invention; and<br>
Fig.  3  is  a simplified schematic  diagram  of  the  control circuitry of Fig.l.<br>
With reference to the drawings, a low power radiation device is shown generally at 10 in Fig.l. Power supply 11 provides electric power to a control unit 12 and a laser diode circuit 13. Circuit 13 preferably provides an output beam of 1917 nm with a 50% power bandwidth of 126 nm as illustrated in Fig.2. The laser beam emerges from beam tube 14 as beam 15. The tube 14 has a diameter of one inch. The control unit 12 provides for pulsed operation of diode circuitry 13 at a rate that is preferably 7.5hz with a power output that is at least lOmw. Beam 15 is about 3/8 inch in diameter. The system is energized via conventional switch 16.<br>
Beam 15 is not 'coherent radiation' as the phrase is used with respect to laser technology but is derived from a laser source via circuitry 13. If the present invention is used in a straight laser mode a 30 degree beam spread is recommended. In addition, the usual safety procedures, particularly with regard to eye protection, must be followed.<br>
A pulse rate of 7.5hz is recommended. Any rate from cw to any frequency can be used, but negative psychological side effects, such as depression or lethargy, below 7.5hz and nervousness, headaches, to extreme agitation above 7.5hz, may occur for some people.<br>
When an area of the body is treated with the beam 15 there will be an  effect on the entire body due to the stimulation of the  immune<br>
4<br><br>
and circulatory systems. For example, when a subject is treated for a viral infection, the areas treated are the sinuses, throat, neck and chest area. Treatment times usually are 30 to 60 seconds on the chest, 15 to 20 seconds on the throat and 20 seconds for the simuses. Thus the lymphatic system is stimulated in the eradication of the virus. If the viral infection is treated at the onset of the first symptoms, the subject usually runs a very low grade fever for one or two hours following the treatment and within six to eight hours all adverse symptoms normally disappear. If a treatment is given after the symptoms have progressed, the treatment alleviates the symptoms and shortens the cycle of the flu or cold.<br>
When the device 10 is used to treat a localized cancer, the beam 15 is focused externally on the area (3.5 minutes for adenocarcinoma of the prostate). Not only is the area stimulated but also the immune system including the T-cells. To further enhance the healing process, the bones of the arms and legs (front-external) are treated to stimulate the bone marrow production of the B cells. The device 10 can be adjusted if necessary to carry a poweroutput of up to 200 raw to treat very difficult afflictions, such as bone cancer and leukemia. Such increased power would minimize the number of treatmeneats necessary versus using the low power mode of the unit 10. With the present device 10, depending on the extent of the infirmity, and the condition of the individual's immune system, positive results have been achieved in as little as one treatment. The device 10 has produced positive results in individuals with an impaired immune system having a T-cell count of under 4 (normal being 20.0-51-1) and with CD4/CD8 ratio of .1 (normal being 1.0-3.41.<br>
5<br><br>
With inflammatory infirmities such as arthritis and impact injuries where swelling is a concern, immediate results are achieved with one external treatment to the afflicted area. The swelling will visibly recede as the treatment is administered. Bruising is eliminated if the treatment with device 10 is given soon after impact. Results are achieved anywhere from immediate treatment to several hours later for such infirmities. The device 10 may be used for treatment after dental procedures and after surgery (both medical and cosmetic) to promote healing and minimize swelling and bruising.<br>
The device 10 and beam 15 are eye-safe. No eye protection is needed. The eyes can be treated for infections, stys and impact injuries and other applications.<br>
Fig. 3 illustrates a simplified schematic diagram of the system. A basic oscillator is formed by one half of the dual timing circuit made  of  Ul and U2.  It is configured as a  free  running  astable multivibrator.   The  frequency is set by R2.  The  most  desirable oscillator frequency has been established by testing and is 7.5hz. Output  of  the oscillator is applied to the trigger input  of  the second  half  of  the  timing circuit  which  is  configured  as  a monostable  multivibrator or commonly known as a (one  shot)  pulse generator.  A series of pulses are thus generated  repeating  every 133 milliseconds (7.5hz) with a pulse duration of approximately  25 milliseconds which is set by the 200K ohm potentiometer. This  pulse train output drives the next section which is  designed to  maintain  a constant current in the laser diode,  Ql,  for  the duration  of  each pulse. The on to off time ratio (known  as  duty cycle) is about 20%. By pulsing the positive input to the operational amplifier U3 high,<br>
6<br><br>
a voltage is developed across the three forward biased diodes D1-D3 and this voltage (approximately 2.1 volts) is used as the reference voltage to set the laser diode current and is applied to the positive input to U3. If the positive input is higher than the negative input, the output will go high and stay high until the voltage at the negative input becomes equal to the reference voltage at the positive input. U3 can control the current flowing through Ql by either increasing or decreasing the voltage at the gate of the N channel field effect transistor Q2 which causes a change in the internal resistance of the FET. By changing the resistance of Q2 from the source to the drain, the current flow in Ql is changed. This current is sampled by developing a feedback voltage across R8 that is in the drain to ground of the PET. The feedback voltage is applied to the negative input of U3. When the feedback voltage becomes equal to the reference voltage the current in the FET will stop increasing and becomes fixed. This action allows U3 to hold the current constant or regulate the current in Q2 and Ql.  The voltage can be measured at jack T3.<br>
Once the current is regulated, the voltage across Ql is not critical and will seek its own level, varying with temperature and the duty cycle of the device. A constant current of approximately 2 amps is established by the reference voltage and is not adjustable. Q2 is conducting the same current in Ql and with a 12 volt DC source from power supply 11 connected at Tl and T2 will dissipate approximately 2.25 watts. A heat sink is required to prevent Q2 from overheating. The heat generated in Ql is about 1/3 that of Q2. The large heat sink used is not so much to dissipate the excess heat, but to keep Ql at a constant temperature in order to  maintain infrare light output at the desired  wavelength.   All<br>
7<br><br>
laser diodes exhibit a frequency shift with temperature change. The most suitable wavelength has been established by testing and produces the therapeutic effect desired.<br>
The metal tube or guide 14 surrounding the laser diode output from circuitry 13 is used to concentrate the beam 15 into an area the size of the tube diameter on the surface of the skin being treated. This is accomplished by the polished surface on the inner wall of the tube, used to reflect the beam 15 back into the area being irradiated instead of spreading out on the surrounding surface.<br>
Resistors R1-R8, capacitors C1-C3, diodes D1-D3, and Ql and Q2 are all standard components used as understood in the art.<br>

8  days later: Re-examined by her physician after the  stroke  when<br>
the vision returned following the treatments. Cataract surgery  was<br>
re-scheduled.<br>
3 weeks later: Scan of left eye and surgery scheduled.<br>
3 weeks later: Successful cataract surgery on left eye.<br>
10 months later: Second cataract extraction on right eye.<br>
Example 20: Subject: 55 year old male diagnosed by his doctors with prostate cancer adenocarcinoma/DJD degenerative joint disease/hemorrhoids in a one month period.<br>
About 5-6 weeks later: After 3 treatments with device 10 the hemorrhoids were gone. Almost no pain in areas diagnosed with DJD, with long periods of no pain at all. There was no swelling. No pain medication after the first treatment. All symptoms from the prostate cancer have been eliminated. No pressure pain, no dripping, no up to the bathroom during the night to urinate. The urination flow had increased and subject was able to fully empty his bladder.  Sex drive and energy returned.<br>
1-4 weeks later: Continued with treatments and status continued as above. The urination flow increased again. Subject is scheduled to be retested.<br>
Example 21: Subject: Osteoarthritis male age 39<br>
Osteoarthritis diagnosed by his physician.<br>
1 day to 2 weeks later: Six treatments with device 10.<br>
16<br><br>
Pain/symptoms  are  gone. Continues with one  treatment  every  six months.<br>
Example 22: Subject: Inguinovulvar Gland Infection female age 44<br>
Inguinovulvar  gland infection which occurs every month since age<br>
15.  Diagonosed  by  her  doctor.  Diagnosed  by  her  doctor  with<br>
perineal acne.<br>
About  3 months later: Diagnosed by her doctor with  inguinovulvar<br>
sebaceous gland infection.  Prescribed bactroban.<br>
Approximately 4 years later: A series of eight (8) treatments  with<br>
device  10.  Gradual decrease in the number, size and duration  of<br>
the  outbreaks.  No breakouts in areas where  repetitive  breakouts<br>
occurred monthly since age 15.  Subject continues now with one  (1)<br>
treatment per month.<br>
Also  had  treatments on both hands for swelling and pain  and  the<br>
treatments corrected both problems.<br>
In  addition  the subject also had treatments on  her  sinuses  for<br>
congestion and pain and both symptoms disappeared.<br>
Example 23: Subject: Male age 26<br>
Had arthoscopic surgery on right knee.  Horseshoe shaped  tear  in<br>
cartilage was removed.  Since surgery, experienced occasional  pain<br>
in  right knee and also left knee.  Had several treatments on  both<br>
knees.  Pain and swelling disappeared.<br>
6 years later: Was bitten on inside of left foot by unknown  spider<br>
type.   Quarter sized blister appeared.  Was given  antibiotic  for<br>
spider  bite by his doctor.  Several days later,blister  unchanged.<br>
Reexamined  and blister was drained and subject was given  stronger<br>
antibiotic  by his doctor.  Blister reappeared several days  later.<br>
Had treatment with device 10. One day later, blister is gone.<br>
17<br><br>
Example 24; Subject: Genital Herpes-female age 32<br>
Ganital  herpes  diagnosed by her physician.  Has already  had  one<br>
outbreak.<br>
Two  treatments with the device 10.  Began treatment on the  second<br>
breakout.   After the first treatment the lesions  healed quickly.<br>
The  second  treatment  was given for  the  third  breakout.   This<br>
outbreak was much milder than the other two.  These lesions  healed<br>
much faster than the others.<br>
Two years later: No further treatment have been given.  There  have<br>
been no more outbreaks even under periods of severe stress.<br>
Example 25: Inflammation, bruising, pain, circulation, cold and flu virus, hemorrhoids.<br>
Several subjects had treatments with the device 10 for common, everyday ocurrences. Areas of inflammation had immediate permanent relief. Bruising was eliminated except where beam 15 was unable to penetrate due to a metal object. Pain was alleviated and/or eliminated. Healing was hastened. Cold and flu viruses, if caught in the early stages, were eradicated from the body in 1/4 of the normal time. Immediately after treatment for a virus, a very low grade fever will ensue and within 12 to 24 hours all symptoms are gone. Hemorrhoids substantially shrank and were not causing problems for the subjects after two treatments with device 10.<br>
The present method is believed to be far superior to any technique currently in use for the treatment of cancer. The absence of any negative side effects is also very significant. The brief duration of the treatment, the low number of tgreatments required, and the fact  that  the treatment can be done in  the  physician's  office,<br>
18<br><br>
indicate that this method will be much more economical than any currently in use. The same can be said of a variety of arthritic conditions treated with the present method.<br>
Although not completely understood, it is believed that the treatment with beam 15(the healing of "H ray") stimulates the healing cells causing cuts, incisions, bruises, etc. to heal much faster than normal. It also is believed to stimulate the imune system causing infections to heal at a faster rate. In cases where immune cells are malfunctioning, such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, etc., the treatment is believed to return the cells to normal, causing them to stop attacking healthy cells.<br>
It appears that the healing that transpires at the point of contact with the beam 15 takes place within the epidermis and the dermis. A sublayer of the epidermis is the stratum corneum which contains keratin, and the lower level where the melanocyte cells are found that produce the pigment. The dermis, located under the epidermis is where the pain and touch receptors are located. These receptors reach to the surface of the skin. Also in the dermis are the blood vessels that supply the nutrition to the skin. With a treatment by device 10, a person can feel warmth and or tingling, sometimes a pulling or tugging sensation such as on a cut and coolness on an infected area. This appears to be the explanation of why the beam 15 heals bruises, keeps skin young and supple, lessens scarring and promotes fast healing of soft tissue injuries. For exdample, if part of a bruised area is covered with foil and then the beam 15 treatment  is  administered,  only the part not  covered  will  not<br>
19<br><br>
bruise. The covered part turns the usual purple, green and yellow and takes days to go away.<br>
Overall, it is believed that the treatment has a very positive effect on nonmutated cells and a lethal effect on cancer cells.<br>
Testing done recently with the device 10 gives indications that the positive effect of the device 10 can be blocked by cortisone and other steroids, chemotherapy and radiation therapy, and conventional treatments for AIDS.<br>
