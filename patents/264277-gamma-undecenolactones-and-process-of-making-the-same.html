				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a new lactone, gamma-<br>
undecenolactone; to the synthesis thereof via the<br>
biological process, in particular the stereoselective<br>
synthesis of each of its (R) or (S) isomers and to the<br>
uses thereof, in particular in the food and perfumery<br>
sector.<br>
"Natural" products are increasingly appreciated by the<br>
general public and, as a result, industries that use<br>
aromatic or odorant compounds concentrate their efforts<br>
on the development of "natural" aromatizing substances<br>
and preparations. Only substances that have been<br>
identified in nature can aspire to this label; they are<br>
therefore currently produced either from plants or from<br>
microorganisms; the latter are increasingly used,<br>
biotechnological processes now making it possible to<br>
synthesize natural molecules at reasonable expense.<br>
This is the case of gamma-lactones.<br>
Gamma-lactones are aromatic molecules that constitute<br>
the aroma and the flavor of many natural products. For<br>
example, gamma-heptalactone is known for its hazelnut<br>
or caramel aroma and taste, gamma-nonalactone has a<br>
fatty, creamy, or coconut aroma; gamma-decalactone and<br>
gamma-undecalactone have a peach or apricot aroma and<br>
taste.<br>
Gamma-lactones exist naturally, in their two<br>
enantiomeric forms (R) and (S) , the (R) enantiomer<br>
being, however, predominant.<br>
Gamma-lactones can be produced synthetically, or by<br>
biosynthesis by means of microorganisms. Thus, EP 371<br>
568 describes a process for producing gamma-lactones by<br><br>
means of microorganisms	that are acceptable for<br>
preparing food products,	such as, in particular,<br>
Saccharomyces cerevisiae,	Debaromyces hansenii or<br>
Candida boidinii.<br>
US 5,112,803 indicates that gamma-octalactone, and in<br>
particular its (R) and (S) optical isomers, can be used<br>
to form butter aromas and flavors, and describes a<br>
process for increasing the aroma or the flavor of<br>
materials that can be consumed, by adding significant<br>
amounts of optically active gamma-octalactones, and a<br>
mixture of various compounds which are by-products of<br>
the biological process for obtaining gamma-<br>
octalactones, described in said patent. The process<br>
described in US 5,112,803 indicates that, using<br>
caprylic acid, it is possible to obtain the two (R) and<br>
(S) isomers of gamma-octalactone by biosynthesis using<br>
strains of the genus Syncephalastratum sp. or<br>
Mortierella sp.; however, this process is not<br>
enantioselective.<br>
Gamma-lactones are of great value in the food flavoring<br>
industry and in the perfumery industry, and real<br>
industrial high stakes are involved in the production<br>
of products that have different organoleptic nuances.<br>
The object of the present invention is to propose a new<br>
gamma-lactone, gamma-undecenolactone, which has<br>
aromatic and gustative properties comparable to those<br>
of known gamma-lactones, but different from the latter,<br>
in particular pineapple and passion fruit aromas and<br>
flavors.<br>
It is known that the chirality of volatile molecules<br>
can induce differences in terms of olfactory percep-<br>
tion, and that the optical isomers of gamma-lactones do<br>
not all have the same organoleptic notes: there is<br>
therefore a considerable advantage in producing a<br><br>
specific optical isomer of a gamma-lactone, in parti-<br>
cular if this production is carried out according to a<br>
process that is at least as efficient, or even more<br>
efficient, than in the prior art and at a competitive<br>
cost.<br>
Another object of the invention is therefore to propose<br>
a process for the biological synthesis of gamma-<br>
undecenolactone that is efficient and economical, and<br>
in particular a process for the stereoselective<br>
synthesis of each of the (R) and (S) optical isomers of<br>
gamma-undecenolactone.<br>
The gamma-undecenolactone in accordance with the inven-<br>
tion corresponds to formula (I):<br><br>
in which the lactone ring can bear an unsaturation<br>
between carbon No. 2 and carbon No. 3, and in which R1<br>
is a C7 alkenyl or alkynyl group bearing at least one<br>
unsaturation, including one C10-C11 alkenic unsatura-<br>
tion, said R1 group being optionally substituted.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention,<br>
Rl comprises a single unsaturation. Very preferably,<br>
this unsaturation is an alkenic unsaturation.<br>
According to another embodiment of the invention, R1<br>
comprises several unsaturations, including one C10<br>
alkenic unsaturation and at least one other alkenic<br>
unsaturation on a carbon other than C7.<br>
According to a specific embodiment of the invention, R1<br>
is an optionally substituted alkene group having 7<br><br>
carbon atoms, bearing a single unsaturation located at<br>
C10-C11.<br>
According to another preferred embodiment of the<br>
invention, R1 is not substituted with a halogen atom,<br>
in particular bromine or chlorine.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention,<br>
Rl is a C7H13 group, preferably the group CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-<br>
CH2-CH2-CH2-, and the lactone ring is saturated.<br>
According to another embodiment of the invention, R1<br>
comprises a single alkynic unsaturation, preferably on<br>
carbon 10.<br>
The term "substituted alkenyl or alkynyl" is intended<br>
to mean an alkenyl or alkynyl in which at least one<br>
carbon bears at least one substituent group. The term<br>
"substituent group" is intended to mean in particular a<br>
hydroxyl group, a keto group, a thiol group, an alkyl<br>
group or an alkenyl group.<br>
The gamma-undecenolactone according to the invention<br>
contains an asymmetric carbon in position 4 and can be<br>
in the (R) or (S) configuration.<br>
The invention relates to both the (R)-gamma-<br>
undecenolactone and the (S)-gamma-undecenolactone, and<br>
the mixture, in any proportions whatsoever, of these<br>
two optical isomers, in particular the racemic mixture.<br>
The invention also relates to the biological prepara-<br>
tion of the gamma-undecenolactone of formula (I) , and<br>
in particular its biosynthesis via the microbial<br>
pathway, from at least one substrate, in particular<br>
undecylenic acid or one of its esters, preferably<br>
methyl or ethyl ester, using a microbial culture of a<br>
strain chosen from those that allow hydroxylation of<br><br>
the substrate, in particular at C4.<br>
This preparation comprises the following steps:<br>
a)	selecting an appropriate strain,<br>
b)	culturing said strain in an appropriate culture<br>
medium, said culturing being optionally<br>
preceded by a step consisting in preculturing<br>
the strain,<br>
c)	adding a substrate that can be converted into<br>
gamma-undecenolactone of formula (1),<br>
d)	bioconverting the substrate to gamma-<br>
undecenolactone of formula (I),<br>
e)	recovering the gamma-undecenolactone of formula<br>
(I) thus produced.<br>
The appropriate microbial strains, targeted in step a)<br>
for the biosynthesis of the gamma-undecenolactone<br>
according to the invention, are those that allow<br>
specific hydroxylation of the substrate, in particular<br>
at C4.<br>
When the product resulting from the biosynthesis is for<br>
use in the food industry, the food-grade strains are of<br>
course preferred. Among the strains that allow stereo-<br>
selective hydroxylation, mention may in particular be<br>
made of the strains of the genus Aspergillus sp.,<br>
Penicillium sp., Mucor sp., Mortierella sp. . Since the<br>
strains all belong to microorganism class 1, and since<br>
some are food strains, their use does not pose any<br>
specific problem either for the industrial production<br>
of lactone or for its possible use in food products.<br>
According to a specific embodiment of the invention,<br>
the strain used is of the genus Aspergillus sp.,<br>
preferably Aspergillus oryzae, of which mention may be<br>
made of the following collections of strains:<br>
Aspergillus oryzae DSMZ 18 61, Aspergillus oryzae DSMZ<br>
18 64, Aspergillus oryzae DSMZ 1147, Aspergillus oryzae<br><br>
DSMZ 63303, Aspergillus oryzae CBS 570.65, Aspergillus<br>
oryzae CBS 819.72, Aspergillus oryzae CBS 110.27,<br>
Aspergillus oryzae VMF 8 8 093.<br>
Among them, Aspergillus oryzae DSMZ 18 61 and<br>
Aspergillus oryzae CBS 110.27 are preferred.<br>
According to another specific embodiment, the strain<br>
used is of the genus Mortierella sp., of which mention<br>
may be made of the following collections of species:<br>
Mortierella	isabellina	DSMZ 1414, Mortierella<br>
isabellina CBS 100559, Mortierella isabellina CBS<br>
221.29, Mortierella isabellina CBS 194.28, Mortierella<br>
isabellina CBS 208.32, Mortierella isabellina CBS<br>
224.35, Mortierella isabellina CBS 560.63, Mortierella<br>
isabellina CBS 167.80, Mortierella isabellina CBS<br>
493.83, Mortierella isabellina CBS 309.93, Mortierella<br>
isabellina CBS 250.95, Mortierella isabellina CBS<br>
109075, Mortierella ramanniana CBS 112.08, Mortierella<br>
ramanniana CBS 219.47, Mortierella ramanniana CBS<br>
243.58, Mortierella ramanniana CBS 478.63, Mortierella<br>
ramanniana CBS 852.72, Mortierella ramanniana CBS<br>
366.95, Mortierella ramanniana CBS 101226.<br>
Among them, the Mortierella isabellina strains will be<br>
preferred, in particular Mortierella isabellina DSMZ<br>
1414, Mortierella isabellina CBS 100559 and Mortierella<br>
isabellina CBS 221.29.<br>
In fact, the inventors have noted that, surprisingly<br>
and unexpectedly, the use of a strain of the genus<br>
Aspergillus sp. results in the selective production of<br>
(R)-gamma-undecenolactone, and that the use of a strain<br>
of the genus Mortierella sp. results in the selective<br>
production of (S)-gamma-undecenolactone.<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention, Yarrowia<br>
lipolytica strains are excluded from the invention<br><br>
since they are not capable of bringing about hydroxyla-<br>
tion at C4. Advantageously, all strains which are not<br>
capable of specifically and stereoselectively producing<br>
hydroxylation at C4 are excluded from the present<br>
invention.<br>
Without wishing to be bound by any theory, it can be<br>
envisioned that the conditions for culturing the<br>
strains could be of importance in the stereoselectivity<br>
observed, and also in the quantitative aspect of the<br>
bioconversion.<br>
The culture targeted in step b) of the process<br>
according to the invention comprises the preparation of<br>
a culture, preferably a semi-concentrated culture, of<br>
the strains, for example by cell amplification, in an<br>
appropriate culture medium. This culture may be<br>
preceded by a preculture of the strains in a first<br>
culture medium more suitable for the first steps of<br>
multiplication of the strain.<br>
The culture conditions used in the stereoselective<br>
process of the invention should be such that they<br>
result in the production of a mycelium which exhibits<br>
swellings filled with inclusions (with peroxysomes in<br>
particular) . According to the preferred embodiment of<br>
the invention, the cell culture prepared has a "compot"<br>
mycelium composed of compartmentalized filaments with<br>
no conidiospores and exhibiting bulging structures,<br>
filled with these inclusions (peroxysomes). The culture<br>
conditions should in fact be particularly appropriate<br>
for preventing sporulation of the mycelium.<br>
Moreover, the inventors have been able to note that the<br>
physiological state of the mycelium, obtained in<br>
particular due to the use of the culture conditions<br>
described in the present application (compartmentalized<br>
mycelium comprising swellings and bulges filled with<br><br>
inclusions, in particular with peroxysomes) could have<br>
a considerable influence on the reaction yield and<br>
would make it possible to obtain yields greater than<br>
those of the prior art. The physiological state of the<br>
mycelium could also have an influence on the<br>
stereoselectivity of the reaction.<br>
Thus, according to a preferred embodiment of the<br>
invention, step b) of the process of the invention is a<br>
step consisting in culturing the strain in an appro-<br>
priate culture medium for obtaining a compartmentalized<br>
mycelium comprising swellings and bulges filled with<br>
inclusions, in particular with peroxysomes. Advanta-<br>
geously, the culture medium used according to the<br>
invention does not contain peptone. Preferably, the<br>
culture medium used according to the invention<br>
comprises malt and/or yeast extract. According to a<br>
preferred embodiment, the mycelium used for step c) is<br>
concentrated. Preferably, the concentration of the<br>
mycelium used for step c) is between 5 and 15 g/1,<br>
preferably 6 to 12 g/1, very preferably 7 to 10 g/1.<br>
It has been particularly noted that the production of<br>
(S)-gamma-lactone by the Mortierella strain is particu-<br>
larly promoted, in terms of stereoselectivity and in<br>
terms of yield, by the use of a swollen mycelium filled<br>
with inclusions as described above; in fact, the use of<br>
such a mycelium would make it possible to obtain a<br>
reaction product which has an optical rotation greater,<br>
in absolute value, than those of the prior art;<br>
furthermore, the yield obtained by means of the process<br>
according to the invention, and in particular by the<br>
use of a swollen mycelium filled with inclusions as<br>
described above, makes it possible to obtain yields<br>
greater than those of the prior art.<br>
Step c) of the process consists in adding the substrate<br>
to the cell culture. According to the invention, the<br><br>
biological synthesis of gamma-undecenolactone involves<br>
any appropriate substrate, and preferably undecylenic<br>
acid or one of its esters. Among the other preferred<br>
substrates, mention may be made of all substituted<br>
derivatives of undecylenic acid or of its esters.<br>
Undecylenic acid and the methyl ester and ethyl ester<br>
of undecylenic acid are particularly preferred sub-<br>
strates. It goes without saying that the substrate can<br>
be any appropriate substrate, or a mixture of various<br>
appropriate substrates, in particular a mixture of<br>
undecylenic acid and of one or more of its esters.<br>
According to an advantageous embodiment of the<br>
invention, the substrate is added to the mycelium<br>
according to a batchwise or fed-batch process. Accord-<br>
ing to a preferred embodiment, the undecylenic acid is<br>
added as a mixture with an auxiliary product, for<br>
example an oil, in particular any conventional food oil<br>
such as soybean, maize, sunflower, or the like, or<br>
synthetic short-chain fatty acid triglycerides such as<br>
miglyol, preferably sunflower oil which is hydrogenated<br>
or rich in oleic acid, prior to it being brought into<br>
contact with the mycelium. The presence of the<br>
auxiliary product makes it possible in particular to<br>
greatly decrease the corrosive or toxic effect of the<br>
substrate, in particular of undecylenic acid. According<br>
to one embodiment of the invention, the synthesis<br>
according to the invention using the Mortierella<br>
isabellina strain is carried out in a medium free of<br>
mineral oil.<br>
Advantageously, the substrate is added in concentra-<br>
tions of from 0.3 to 2.5 g/l/h. Advantageously, the<br>
amount of oil, preferably of plant oil, mixed with the<br>
substrate is from 100 to 500 g/1, preferably 150 to<br>
300 g/1.<br>
A source of sugar, preferably of glucose, is also added<br><br>
to the medium, at the same time as the substrate, so as<br>
to ensure that the energy needs of the cells are<br>
covered. Advantageously, the concentration of glucose<br>
added is from 0.3 to 0.4 g/l/h.<br>
The pH can be adjusted, as needed, during the addition<br>
of the substrate and throughout the duration of the<br>
bioconversion that will follow, by means of the<br>
addition of any appropriate base. The pH should be<br>
between 4.5 and 8.5, preferably between 5.5 and 8, and<br>
preferably between 6 and 7.5.<br>
The temperature is preferably maintained between 27 and<br>
30°C, during the bioconversion. The duration of the<br>
bioconversion may be from 30 to 120 hours, preferably<br>
from 48 to 72 hours.<br>
The bioconversion of the substrate to gamma-undeceno-<br>
lactone, covered in step d) of the process of the<br>
invention, is a step consisting of lactonization<br>
preceded by a reaction consisting of hydroxylation of<br>
the substrate at C4, carried out by the strain. A<br>
source of oxygen is required in order for it to be<br>
possible for this hydroxylation to be carried out. This<br>
source of oxygen is preferably a gas containing oxygen,<br>
very preferably air or oxygen. The gas is dissolved in<br>
a relatively large amount in the reaction medium.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, and as is known in<br>
the prior art, antifoams, in particular silicone oils<br>
or polymers of polyethylene glycol esterified with<br>
fatty acids, are used to control the foam that may form<br>
during the bioconversion.<br>
Once the bioconversion, i.e. the specific and stereo-<br>
selective hydroxylation at C4, followed by the lactoni-<br>
zation, has been carried out, step e) of the process<br>
consists in recovering the gamma-undecenolactone by<br><br>
extraction, the extraction of the gamma-undecenolactone<br>
being carried out by any appropriate means. Advanta-<br>
geously, the extraction of the gamma-undecenolactone is<br>
carried out by hydrodistillation, optionally followed<br>
by an esterification intended to subsequently eliminate<br>
the substrate which has not reacted.<br>
Alternatively, the extraction of the gamma-undeceno-<br>
lactone is carried out by solvent extraction<br>
(cyclohexane, ethyl acetate) , after acidification of<br>
the medium.<br>
According to a variant of the process according to the<br>
invention, step e) of the process is not carried out,<br>
and instead, a step e') is carried out, which step<br>
consists in continuing the process at the end of step<br>
d) by means of an in situ reduction of the gamma-<br>
undecenolactone obtained, before extraction, so as to<br>
obtain, for example, the corresponding gamma-undeca-<br>
lactone. According to a specific embodiment, the<br>
reduction can be stopped so as to obtain a gamma-<br>
undecenolactone that has fewer unsaturations than that<br>
derived from the bioconversion of step d). According to<br>
this other embodiment, the process according to the<br>
invention is continued at the end of step d) by<br>
stopping the pH regulation of the fermenter, and adding<br>
an active dry yeast, which may be a baker's yeast, a<br>
wine-maker's yeast or a brewer's yeast, and a source of<br>
sugar, in particular of glucose, to the reactor. When<br>
the pH reaches the value of 5.5, it is regulated at 5.5<br>
with an appropriate base, for example sodium hydroxide.<br>
The mixture is left to incubate in order for the<br>
reduction to take place, preferably for a period of 12<br>
to 24 hours, and then the gamma-undecalactone is<br>
extracted under the conditions described in step e) .<br>
According to another variant, the gamma-undecenolactone<br>
can be reduced to gamma-undecalactone by means of a<br>
fresh culture of a reducing microorganism or a<br><br>
microorganism that is at least placed under reducing<br>
conditions, for example Saccharomyces cerevisiae or<br>
Pichia	etchelsii,	Pichia	pastoris,	Hansenula<br>
polymorpha, Bacillus subtilis or Lactobacillus brevis.<br>
According to a specific embodiment of the invention,<br>
the reduction in step e') results in the production of<br>
gamma-undecalactone and this gamma-undecalactone<br>
corresponds to the formula:<br><br>
in which R1 is an optionally substituted C7 alkyl<br>
group. The term "substituted alkyl" is intended to mean<br>
an alkyl, at least one carbon of which bears at least<br>
one substituent group. The term "substituent group" is<br>
intended to mean in particular a hydroxyl group, a keto<br>
group, a thiol group, an alkyl group or an alkenyl<br>
group.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention,<br>
Rl is the group C7H13, very preferably CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-<br>
CH2-CH2-CH2-.<br>
The gamma-undecalactone obtained according to this<br>
specific embodiment contains an asymmetrical carbon in<br>
position 4 which has the same configuration as that of<br>
the gamma-undecenolactone molecule from which it<br>
derives, since the reduction reaction does not modify<br>
the stereoisomerism of the molecule.<br>
Step e') can also be carried out and makes it possible<br>
to obtain a more saturated (R)- or (S)-undecenolactone<br>
or an (R)- or (S)-gamma-undecalactone, depending on the<br>
stereochemistry of the gamma-undecenolactone obtained<br><br>
in step d).<br>
These saturated lactones, the (R)-gamma-undecalactone<br>
and the (S)-gamma-undecalactone, can be used in the<br>
same applications as their unsaturated homologs: these<br>
lactones have odorant and gustative properties such<br>
that they can be used in all perfumery and food<br>
flavoring applications, in particular for the produc-<br>
tion of perfumes, of odorant substances, or of cosmetic<br>
or food compositions, or as a food additive.<br>
For the purpose of the present invention, the term<br>
"perfumery" denotes not only perfumery in the usual<br>
sense of the term, but also the other fields in which<br>
the odor of products is important. This may involve<br>
perfumery compositions in the usual sense of the term,<br>
such as fragrancing bases and concentrates, eaux de<br>
Cologne, eaux de toilette, perfumes and similar<br>
products; topical compositions - in particular cosmetic<br>
compositions - such as face and body creams, talcum<br>
powders, hair oils, shampoos, hair lotions, bath salts<br>
and oils, bath and shower gels, toilet soaps, body<br>
antiperspirants and deodorants, shaving lotions and<br>
creams, soaps, creams, toothpastes, mouthwashes,<br>
ointments, and similar products; and maintenance<br>
products, such as softeners, detergents, washing<br>
powders, air fresheners, and similar products.<br>
The term "odorant" is used to denote a compound which<br>
gives off an odor.<br>
The term "food flavoring" is intended to mean any use<br>
of the compounds of the invention for the flavoring of<br>
any human or animal, liquid or solid food product, in<br>
particular drinks, dairy products, ice creams.<br>
The gamma-undecenolactone, (R) or (S), or a mixture of<br>
(R) and (S) , and also the gamma-undecalactone, (R) or<br><br>
(S) , or a mixture of (R) and (S) , can be used as<br>
perfuming compositions in order to contribute to<br>
providing exotic, floral or fruity notes, which has<br>
resulted in the applicant registering the trademark<br>
"Tropicalone®" given to the gamma-undecenolactone.<br>
According to the applications, the (S) enantiomer or<br>
the (R) enantiomer, or else a mixture of the 2<br>
enantiomers in proportions determined by a person<br>
skilled in the art, will be used.<br>
Preferably, the products according to the invention are<br>
used in amounts of between 0.0025% and 10% by weight<br>
relative to the total weight of the composition in<br>
which they are present. They may go to make up the<br>
composition of solids or of liquids, and in particular<br>
the composition of gels, creams, ointments and/or<br>
sprays.<br>
The products according to the invention can also be<br>
used in a composition that is itself odorant, or in a<br>
composition in which the odorant agent is used to mask<br>
or neutralize certain odors.<br>
Other characteristics and advantages of the present<br>
invention will emerge clearly upon reading the examples<br>
given hereinafter, which illustrate the invention<br>
without, however, limiting it.<br>
Example 1, step a: - Selection of strains<br>
All the strains of the collection are first inoculated<br>
onto MGY agar medium and incubated for 72 h at 27 °C;<br>
these strains are subsequently inoculated into one-<br>
liter Erlenmeyer flasks containing 100 ml of 1x malt<br>
medium and incubated for 24 h at 27°C. The substrate,<br>
undecylenic acid, is then added to the culture medium<br>
(5 g/1 in 10 doses) and the culture is maintained for a<br>
further 48 h to 120 h at 27°C.<br><br>
After olfaction and analyses of the gamma-<br>
undecenolactone concentration in the media, the most<br>
advantageous strains are selected; this was the case<br>
for the Mortierella isabellina CBS 100559, Mortierella<br>
isabellina CBS 221.29, Aspergillus oryzae DSMZ 1861 and<br>
Aspergillus oryzae CBS 110.27 strains, which were<br>
subsequently used for the fermenter optimization<br>
trials.<br>
Example 1, step b: - Preparation of cell cultures<br>
The Mortierella isabellina CBS 100559, Mortierella<br>
isabellina CBS 221.29, Aspergillus oryzae DSMZ 1861 or<br>
Aspergillus oryzae CBS 110.27 strain (origin = tube<br>
frozen at -80°C) is inoculated onto MGY agar and<br>
incubated at 27°C for 30 minutes.<br>
The above preculture is inoculated into 5 1 of 1x malt<br>
medium in a 6 1 fermenter:<br><br>
Mortierella isabellina<br>
Incubation is carried out at 27°C, 500 rpm, 3.5 1/1/h<br>
of air, open pH, for 30 hours.<br>
Aspergillus oryzae<br>
Incubation is carried out at 20°C, 500 rpm, 0.05 vvm of<br>
air, open pH, for 30 h and then at 25°C, 500 rpm, 0.05<br>
vvm of air, open pH, for 24 hours. In both cases, a<br>
mycelium containing many large bulges full of<br>
inclusions (including peroxysomes) should be obtained.<br>
125 1 of 1.5x malt medium are then prepared in a 300 1<br>
fermenter:<br><br><br><br>
The medium is sterilized for 40 minutes at 121°C. The<br>
fermenter and its parts are sterile and pressurized.<br>
The temperature is stable and regulated at 27°C. The<br>
pressure is flushed and an air flow rate of 3.5 1/1/h,<br>
i.e. approximately 0.6 m3/h, is maintained. The base<br>
(10 N NaOH), the acid (85% H3PO4), the antifoam and the<br>
6 1 fermenter which serves as inoculum are sterily<br>
brought together. The agitation speed is adjusted to<br>
325 rpm, the antifoam is initiated, and then the<br>
inoculum (5 1) is inoculated, open pH. The agitation<br>
speed is maintained at 325 rpm and the aeration is<br>
increased to 2.2 m3/h (0.3 vvm) . Growth is allowed to<br>
continue for 24 hours, so as to have approximately<br>
10 g/1 of mycelium on a dry weight basis: this mycelium<br>
should be "compot" and should consist of filaments<br>
comprising numerous bulges and swellings, without<br>
spores.<br>
Example 2, steps c and d: Conversion of the undecylenic<br>
acid by the Mortlerella sp. strains<br>
Once the amount and the quality of mycelium have been<br>
achieved, the undecylenic acid is dispensed at the flow<br>
rate of 0.3 g/l/h for 6 h, and then at the flow rate of<br>
0.53 g/l/h for 72 h: i.e. a total of 40 g/1. This<br>
undecylenic acid is dispensed as a mixture with<br>
hydrogenated sunflower oil (1/4 acid-3/4 oil); this oil<br>
is therefore dispensed at the flow rates of 0.9 g/l/h<br>
and then 1.53 g/l/h. Glucose is continuously dispensed,<br>
in parallel, at the flow rate of 0.36 g/l/h for 72 h.<br>
The pH is regulated at 7.5 throughout the duration of<br>
the fermentation, with 5 N NaOH. The speed is increased<br>
to 505 rpm and aeration is carried out at the flow rate<br>
of 1 vvm, i.e. 12 m3/h. The conversion is pursued for<br>
72 hours.<br>
A production of 6.5 g/1 of gamma-undecenolactone, the<br><br>
stereoisomerism of which is (S), is obtained.<br>
Example 3, steps c and d: Conversion of the undecylenic<br>
acid by the Aspergillus sp. strains<br>
Once the amount and the quality of the mycelium have<br>
been attained, the undecylenic acid is dispensed at the<br>
flow rate of 0.3 g/l/h for 6 h, and then of 0.53 g/l/h<br>
for 72 h: i.e. a total of 40 g/1. This undecylenic acid<br>
is dispensed as a mixture with hydrogenated sunflower<br>
oil (1/4 acid-3/4 oil). Glucose is continuously<br>
dispensed, in parallel, at the flow rate of 0.36 g/l/h<br>
for 72 h. The pH is regulated at 6.5 throughout the<br>
duration of the fermentation, with 5 N NaOH. Aeration<br>
is carried out at the flow rate of 0.5 vvm, i.e.<br>
6 m3/h. The conversion is pursued for 80 hours. A<br>
production of 0.5 g/1 of gamma-undecenolactone, the<br>
stereoisomerism of which is (R), is obtained.<br>
Example 4, step e: Extraction-purification<br>
Acidification at pH 1.5 is carried out with 3 1 of 85%<br>
phosphoric acid. Heating is carried out at more than<br>
100 °C for 30 minutes in order for the lactone to be<br>
essentially in its cyclized form and not in its open<br>
hydroxy acid form. The lactone is quantitatively<br>
determined, extraction solvent is added (preferably<br>
cyclohexane), and the mixture is stirred at ambient<br>
temperature for 1 hour. Centrifugation is carried out<br>
and the organic phase is recovered. The lactone is<br>
quantitatively determined. The solvent is concentrated<br>
and an oily "crude" is thus obtained. Vacuum distilla-<br>
tion is carried out. The "deresined" lactone and an<br>
exhausted oil are obtained. Purification is<br>
subsequently carried out by fractionating the lactone<br>
under vacuum. A product that is &gt; 99% pure is obtained,<br>
which product is either gamma-undecenolactone (&gt; 99% S)<br>
if a strain of Mortierella sp. was used, or gamma-<br>
undecenolactone (&gt; 99% R) if a strain of Aspergillus<br>
sp. was used.<br><br>
Example 5, step e': Reduction of gamma-undecenolactone<br>
to gamma-undecalactone<br>
Instead of stopping the reaction, after the<br>
bioconversion of example 3, the process is continued as<br>
follows:<br>
The fermenter pH regulation is stopped. 200 g/1 of<br>
active dry yeast from commercial baker's yeast (i.e.<br>
30 kg of yeast) and 100 g/1 of glucose (i.e. 15 kg of<br>
dry glucose or 30 kg of glucose syrup at 50%) are added<br>
to the medium. As soon as the pH reaches the value of<br>
5.5, the pH is regulated at pH 5.5, with a 5 N NaOH<br>
base. Incubation is carried out for 12 to 24 h at 30°C,<br>
325 rpm, air at 0.5 vvm. (S)-gamma-undecalactone or<br>
(R)-gamma-undecalactone are obtained, as appropriate.<br>
The extraction and the purification are then carried<br>
out in accordance with example 4 above.<br>
Example 6: Evaluation of the (S)-gamma-undecenolactone<br>
in perfumery<br>
The 99%-pure (S)-gamma-undecenolactone was tested on a<br>
sponge and in solution (of 5% in ethanol) : the head<br>
gives the impression of lactonic aldehyde of gamma-<br>
undecalactone intreleven aldehyde type (IFF), and very<br>
powerful. The background is very natural, lactonic and<br>
very powerful pineapple flesh.<br>
It was also tested in a formulation where it gives an<br>
interesting marine fruity note, for example in the<br>
following formula:<br><br><br><br>
Example 7: Evaluation of the (S)-gamma-undecenolactone<br>
in terms of a food flavoring<br>
The 99%-pure (S)-gamma-undecenolactone was tested at<br>
10 ppm in mineral water: it has a woody and fruity note<br>
very different from that given by any other lactone<br>
used up until now in formulation; by comparison with<br>
(R)-gamma-decalactone, with (R) delta-decalactone and<br>
with (R) delta-dodecalactone, at the same dosage (10<br>
ppm) , it has more of a coco flavor and is more woody<br>
with pineapple and passion fruit notes.<br>
In sugary water (10 ppm), it also has notes with a<br>
milk-like, very fatty, sugary, sweet characteristic.<br>
Its potency at 10 ppm gives it an advantage in<br>
formulation due to its unique milk characteristic,<br>
concentrated milk tendency.<br>
Also tested at 0.5 ppm and 1 ppm on a cream flavoring:<br>
it stands out better in the mouth at 0.5 ppm, giving a<br>
roundness to the cream and giving it a unique condensed<br>
milk-type characteristic.<br>
Example 8: Evaluation of the (S)-gamma-undecalactone in<br>
terms of food flavoring<br>
When compared at 99%-pure on a sponge with (R)-gamma-<br>
undecalactone, (S)-gamma-undecalactone gives less<br>
fatty, more natural and more "peachy" notes.<br>
When evaluated at 10 ppm in mineral water, it gives a<br>
characteristic peach and apricot taste.<br><br>
Example 9: Evaluation of the (S)-gamma-undecalactone in<br>
a food flavoring formulation<br>
