FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to improved genetic constructs. In particular, the<br>
present invention relates to nucleic acid molecules that can be used to generate high<br>
levels of expression of proteins encoded by nucleic sequences of the nucleic acid<br>
molecule. The present invention also relates to improved DNA vaccines and gene<br>
therapeutics.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The HTV-1 Rev-RRE is well known but not completely understood. It is known<br>
that genes encoding HIV structural proteins, i.e. HIV genes gag, pol and env each contain<br>
an RRE which is recognized by HIV protein Rev. These sequences are known to interact<br>
with the HIV protein Rev. Nucleic acid molecules in cells that contain the RRE bind to<br>
Rev that is present in the cell and are transported to the cytoplasm. This transport results<br>
in a higher level of gene expression relative to that observed in the absence of the RRE or<br>
Rev in similar constructs. U.S. Patent Nos. 5,554,528 and 5,604,114, which are<br>
incorporated herein by reference, disclose HIV RRE sequences. U.S. Patent Nos.<br><br>
5,650,309 and 5,665,577, which are incorporated herein by reference, disclose vectors<br>
that comprise HIV RRE sequences.<br>
The CTE system is well known and described in, inter alia, U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
5,585,263 and 5,880,276, which are each incorporated herein by reference. According to<br>
this system, host proteins recognize the CTE sequence on the mRNA and transport it<br>
from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. This transport results in a higher level of gene<br>
expression relative to that observed in the absence of the RRE or Rev in similar<br>
constructs. CTE systems are also described in Bray, M., S. Prasad, J. W. Dubay, E.<br>

ACCOMPANYING<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THEACCCOMPANYING FIGURES<br>
Figures 1-5 show data from comparisons made between the immune responses<br>
against HIV-1 Env following administration of one of three plasmids, each of which<br>
encode Env in which the Env coding sequence contains the RRE. These data are<br>
described in the Example below.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to the invention, nucleic acid molecules are supplied with two different<br>
transport elements which when present on mRNA result in the shuttling of the mRNA<br>
from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and protein production in the cell is increased. The<br>
two transport elements operate independent of one another and when used together result<br>
in a higher enhancement of protein production than simply an additive effect.<br>
Each of the transport systems employed is known. One is the HiV-1 Rev-Rev<br>
response element (RRE) system. The other is the CTE system isolated from Mason<br>
Pfizer Monkey Virus. According to the invention, genetic constructs contain both an<br>
RRE and at least one CTE. Furthermore, the constructs are provided with HiV-1 Rev-<br>
encoding sequences to provide the cell with the Rev protein needed to engage the RRE<br>
and effect transport.<br>
As used herein, the term "genetic construct" is meant to refer to a nucleic acid<br>
molecule that comprises a nucleic acid sequence that encodes a protein (coding sequence)<br>
operably linked to elements necessary for expression of the coding sequence. In some<br>
embodiments, the genetic construct is DNA, preferably a plasmid or genome of a viral<br><br>
vector. In some embodiments, the genetic construct is RNA, preferably a genome of a<br>
retroviral vector.<br>
According to the present invention, genetic constructs are provided which<br>
comprise coding sequence for Rev, and a coding sequence for a desired protein. As used<br>
herein, the term "desired protein: is meant to refer to any protein, including proteins with<br>
physiologically or immunogenically active sequences, provided such protein comprises at<br>
least a portion of coding sequence for an HIV structural protein that includes an RRE and<br>
the mRNA that includes a coding sequence for the protein comprises at least one CTE.<br>
In some embodiments, the desired protein is an HIV structural protein and the mRNA<br>
that includes a coding sequence for the HIV structural protein comprises at least one<br>
CTE. In some embodiments, the desired protein is a fusion protein comprising at least a<br>
portion an HIV structural protein and a non-HIV portion. In some embodiments, the non-<br>
HIV portion may be an immunogenically or physiologically active protein or<br>
immunogenically or physiologically active fragment thereof that further comprises an<br>
HIV structural protein or fragment thereof that comprises a RRE. If the desired protein<br>
is not an HIV structural protein, i.e. it is a fusion protein, the nature of non-HIV<br>
sequences will determine if the genetic construct is a vaccine or a gene therapeutic. That<br>
is, if the fusion protein that is the desired protein is an immunogen, the construct may be<br>
used to induce immune responses such as a use as a vaccine, or a starting material for<br>
protein production. If the fusion protein is biologically active and non-immunogenic, the<br>
construct may be used a gene therapeutic or a starting material for protein production.<br>
The invention also provides a composition with at least two nucleic acid<br>
molecules, at least one of which comprises a coding sequence for HIV-1 Rev, and at least<br>
one of which comprises a coding sequence for a desired protein. In some embodiments,<br>
nucleic acid molecules are DNA molecules, preferably plasmids.<br>
The genetic constructs of the invention and nucleic acid molecules of<br>
compositions of the invention include a coding sequence selected from the group<br>
consisting of gag, pol, env, and a fragment thereof which include an RRE. That is, the<br>
invention can be used for high level expression of the HIV proteins encoded by of gag,<br>
pol, or env, or alternatively, they can be used for high level expression of fusion proteins<br>
that include portions of gag, pol, or env gene products that include the RRE. The genetic<br><br>
construct also contains coding sequences that encode HIV-1 Rev protein operably linked<br>
to regulatory elements so that the Rev protein is produced. The compositions contains a<br>
nucleic acid molecule that comprises the coding sequences that encode HIV-1 Rev<br>
protein operably linked to regulatory elements so that the Rev protein is produced.<br>
According to the invention, the CTE sequence or sequences are included in the<br>
gene construct or nucleic molecule of a composition in the sequence of the protein to be<br>
produced. In preferred embodiments, the CTE sequence is included at a site 3' of the<br>
polyadenylation tail. In some embodiments, the gene construct may contain more than<br>
one CTE sequences. In some embodiments, it may contain 2,3,4 or 5 CTE sequences.<br>
The present invention further provides methods of inducing an immune response<br>
against an immunogen in an individual, methods of delivering a protein to an individual<br>
and methods of producing a protein.<br>
The methods of inducing an immune response against an immunogen in an<br>
individual and the methods of delivering a protein to an individual comprising the step of<br>
administering to the individual a genetic construct or composition as described above. In<br>
the methods of inducing immune responses, the desired protein is immunogenic. If the<br>
desired protein is an HIV structural protein, the genetic construct is a vaccine and the<br>
desired protein is expressed for the purpose of being an immunogen. Similarly, if the<br>
desired protein is an immunogenic protein, the genetic construct or composition can be<br>
used as a vaccine and the desired protein is expressed for the purpose of being an<br>
immunogen. Immune responses may be induced to provide protective or therapeutic<br>
effects or to produce antibodies and antigen specific immune system cells specific for the<br>
immunogen. Such antibodies and cells may be collected and used.<br>
Examples of immunogens that can be encoded by the present invention include<br>
the HIV structural proteins Gag, Pol, Env, and fragments thereof. In addition, vaccines<br>
may be prepared in which the immunogen is a target protein as described in U.S. Pat. No.<br>
5,593,972 issued Jan. 14,1997 that is incorporated herein by reference. Such<br>
immunogens may be pathogen proteins, proteins associated with hyperproliferative<br>
diseases or proteins associated with autoimmune diseases as well as allergens. For all<br>
non-HIV structural protein immunogens, the immunogenic protein must be presented as a<br>
fusion protein encoded by a chimeric gene which includes coding sequence that includes<br><br>
at least the portion of the HIV structural protein coding sequence which is the RRE. In<br>
embodiments of the invention in which an immune response is delivered, the present<br>
invention may be used in combination with adjuvants, immunomodulating proteins and<br>
genetic sequences that encode immunomodulating proteins such as cytokines,<br>
chemokines, and growth factors.<br>
The methods of delivering a protein to an individual comprise the step of<br>
administering to the individual a genetic construct or composition as described above. In<br>

GCSF, receptors thereof, CD28, CD80, CD86, CD40, CD40L, mAbs, Fabs, F(ab)2S,<br>
chimeric, humanized, primatized, human mAbs, Fabs, F(ab)2S, DNAse, tPA, Factors I-<br>
XII, or active fragments thereof. In some embodiments, the desired protein is an antigen<br>
as set forth in US Patent No. 5, 593,972 which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The methods of producing a protein in a cell comprise the step of culturing a cell<br>
that comprises a genetic construct or at least two nucleic acid molecules of the<br>
composition as described above. In such methods, the cell may be any cell in which both<br>
the RRE system and CTE system are active. In some embodiments, the cell is a mammal<br>
cell. In some embodiments, the cell is a human cell.<br>
In preferred embodiments, the genetic constructs are plasraids that may be<br>
delivered to the patient by direct administration. There are a large number of methods<br>
that can be used to deliver DNA directly to a patient. In addition to those described in<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,593,972, which is incorporated herein by reference, other methods<br>
include those described in U.S. Patent No. 5,739,118 which is incorporated herein by<br>
reference, and U.S. Patent No. 5,981,505 which is incorporated herein by reference. In<br>
addition, the methods described in the patents and publications disclosed in<br><www.dnavaccine.com>, which are each incorporated herein by reference, may be<br>
employed using the improvements described herein. For example, the invention is<br><br>
compatible with any plasmid delivery system such as lipofectins, cationic lipids, anionic<br>
lipids, liposomes, transfection agents, and cell targeting agents.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, plasmid DNA is administered to an individual by<br>
intramuscular injection. In addition to plasmid DNA, the injectable composition may<br>
optionally comprise a facilitating such as bupivacaine or a related composition including<br>
those described in PCT Application Serial NumberPCT/US94/00899, which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
In addition to use in plasmids, the constructs of the present invention may be<br>
useful in other genetic delivery systems in which DNA that encodes proteins whose<br>
expression is desired is transcribed in the nucleus, such as retroviruses or other viral or<br>
non-viral vectors.<br>
EXAMPLE<br>
