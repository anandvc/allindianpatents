[Document Name] SpecificationDT[Tirle cf the Invention] WATER-COOLED INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE HAVING RADIATOR<br>
[Technical Field]<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a water-cooled internal combustion engine having a radiator through which cooling water of water jackets provided in a cylinder block and a cylinder head included in an engine body circulates.<br>
[Background Art]<br>
[0002]<br>
A cooling device for an internal combustion engine has been known, in which: a radiator through which the cooling water of water jackets provided in an engine including a cylinder block and a cylinder head circulates is disposed separated from the engine body in a prescribed direction; a supply pipe which leads the low-temperature cooling water pressure-fed by a water pump after radiating heat at the radiator to the water jackets is connected to the cylinder block; and an inlet pipe which leads the cooling water coming from the water jackets after cooling the cylinder block and the cylinder head to the radiator is connected to the cylinder block (see the patent document 1, for example).<br>
[Patent Document 1] JP-A No. 2005-9499<br>
[Disclosure of the Invention]<br>
[Problem to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
[0003]<br>
In an internal combustion engine in which a supply pipe<br><br>
and an inter pipe are connected to a cylinder block, the cylinder block is required to be provided with a return water path for returning the cooling water having flowed out of the cylinder block into a cylinder head and having thereby cooled the cylinder head back to the cylinder block. This complicates the cooling water circulation structure of the cylinder block and enlarges the cylinder block so as to accommodate the return water path. If, in such a case, a thermostat is to be installed in the cylinder block, the cooling water circulation structure of the cylinder block is further complicated.<br>
In an internal combustion engine in which an accommodation chamber for accommodating, for example, a transmission mechanism to rotationally drive the cam shaft of a valve train is disposed in an end portion toward a radiator of the engine body, the accommodation chamber is positioned between water jackets and the radiator. As a result, the distance in a prescribed direction between the radiator and the water jackets, all separated from the engine body in the prescribed direction, is lengthened by an amount equivalent to the len^gth in the prescribed direction of the accommodation chamber. This results in longer cooling water piping connecting the engine body and the radiator, making it difficult to compactly lay out the cooling water piping.<br>
In cases in which a temperature sensor for detecting the temperature of the water jacket cooling water is used to detect the engine temperature, it is preferable for the purpose of detecting the temperature of the engine body as a whole that the temperature sensor be disposed in a location not much<br><br>
affted by local water temperature changes in the water jackets Furthermore, the disposition of the temperature sensor preferably should net prevent the cooling water piping from being laid cut compactly.<br>
Still furthermore, in cases in which an air vent pipe for letting out air inside a water pump is connected to the radiator, the air vent pipe is lengthened to result in restricting the layout of other cooling water pipes. This complicates the layout of the cooling water piping. [0004]<br>
The present invention has been made in view of the above circumstance, and the inventions according to Claims 1 to 7 aim at simplifying a water circulation structure of a cylinder block and realizing a compact layout of cooling water piping connecting an engine body and a radiator. The invention according to Claim 2 further aims at improving cooling efficiency by appropriately locating the cooling water piping. The inventions according to Claims 4 and 5 aim at promoting compactly laying out the cooling water piping by appropriately determining a position where to dispose a temperature sensor for detecting cooling water temperature. The invention of Claim 5 aims at improving the accuracy in detecting the temperature of the engine body as a whole and disposing the temperature sensor compactly. The invention according to Claim 6 aims at realizing a compact layout of the cooling water piping by shortening an air vent pipe connected to a water pump. [Means for Solving the Problem]<br><br>
The invention according to Clain 1 provides a water-cooled internal combution engine, including: an engine body which includes a cylinder block provided with a cylinder block water jacket and a cylinder head provided with a cylinder head water jacket; and a cooling device provided with a water pump which pressure-feeds cooling water to the water jackets, and a radiator through which the cooling water of the water jackets circulates, wherein; the radiator is disposed separated from the engine body in a prescribed direction and an accommodation chamber which accommodates a transmission mechanism for a valve system disposed extending, along a cylinder axis, from the cylinder block to the cylinder head is provided in an end portion toward the radiator in the prescribed direction of the engine body. In the water-cooled internal combustion engine, a cooling water outlet portion open to the cylinder head water jacket is provided in a portion, included in the end portion, of the cylinder head, the cooling water outlet portion being connected with an inlet pipe for leading the cooling water having flowed out of the cylinder block water jacket into the cylinder head water jacket to the radiator, and the cooling water outlet portion is disposed closer, in the prescribed direction, to the radiator than the accommodation chamber.<br>
The invention according to Claim 2 provides the water-cooled internal combustion engine according to Claim 1, wherein: the cooling water outlet portion is open to an upper end portion of the cylinder head water jacket; and a cooling water inlet portion through which the cooling water having radiated heat at the radiator enters the cylinder block water<br><br>
jacket" iS provided in a lower  end portion of the cylinder block.<br>
The invenrion according to Claim 3 provides the water-cccled internal combustion engine according to either of Claims 1 and 2, wherein: the ccclinq device is provided with a thermostat which performs control to establish or shut off a cooling water circulation through the radiator according to a state of warming up of the engine, and the water pump and the thermostat are both attached to the end portion to be closer, in the prescribed direction, to the radiator than the accommodation chamber.<br>
The invention according to Claim 4 provides the water-cooled internal combustion engine according to any of Claims 1 to 3, wherein: a temperature sensor which is attached to the portion, included in the end portion, of the cylinder head to detect cooling water temperature extends in a direction orthogonal to the prescribed direction outside the cylinder head.<br>
The invention according to Claim 5 provides the water-cooled internal combustion engine according to Claim 4, wherein: the water-cooled internal combustion engine further includes an intake device forming an intake path which extends in a cylinder axis direction of the cylinder block as seen in the orthogonal direction; a pipe connection section including the cooling water outlet portion is provided in the portion, included in the end portion, of the cylinder head; and the temperature sensor is fixed to the pipe connection section in a location, as seen in the prescribed direction, between the intake path and cooling water piping which is connected to the<br><br>
pipe connectr section and through which the ooing water passes .<br>
The invention according to Claim 6 provides the water-cooled internal combustion engine according to Claim 5, wherein: an air vent pipe for letting out air accumulated in the water pump that is attached to the portion, included in the end portion, 'of the cylinder head to be closer, in the prescribed direction, to the radiator than the accommodation chamber is connected, in the prescribed direction, to the pipe connection section and communicated with the cylinder head water jacket. [Effect of the Invention] [0006]<br>
According to the invention according to Claim 1, the cooling water having, after cooling the cylinder block, flowed into the cylinder head water jacket and having thereby cooled the cylinder head need not be made to go through the cylinder block again before being sent out to the radiator. This<br>
■<br>
simplifies the water circulation structure in the cylinder block and makes the cylinder block smaller. Furthermore, since the cooling water outlet portion is disposed, in the prescribed direction, closer to the radiator than the accommodation chamber, the inlet pipe can be shortened to reduce its line resistance and improve cooling efficiency. This makes the layout of the inlet pipe compact.<br>
According to what is described in Claim 2, the cooling water flowing in from the lower end portion of the cylinder block enters the cylinder head water jacket after flowing through the cylinder block water jacket and subsequently flows out of the<br><br><br>
-".<br>
Pipe end period of the   cylinder head water jacket to the radiator. Thus, the cooling water circulates smoothly, allowing the cylinder block and the cylinder head to be cooled with improved efficiency.<br>
According to what is described in Claim 3, even though the accommodation chamber is disposed between, in the prescribed direction, the water jackets and the radiator in the engine body, the cooling water outlet portion, the water pump, and the thermostat are concentratedly disposed close to the radiator. This makes it possible to shorten the cooling water piping, improve cooling efficiency, and compactly lay out the cooling water piping.<br>
According to what is described in Claim 4, even though the temperature sensor is attached to an end portion of the cylinder head, it extends in a direction orthogonal to the prescribed direction outside the cylinder head, so that the exposed part exposed outside the cylinder head of the temperature sensor is prevented from interfering with the layout of the cooling water piping, including the inlet pipe, disposed closer to the radiator than the end portion of the cylinder head. This promotes compactly laying out the cooling water piping.<br>
According to what is described in Claim 5, the temperature sensor is attached to the pipe connection section wherein the cooling water outlet portion through which the cooling water coming from the cylinder head water jacket heads for the radiator is provided. Thus, the temperature sensor is disposed at a location where the cooling water having passed the cylinder block water jacket and cylinder head water jacket collects<br><br>

The temoerature sensor can therefore detect the water<br><br>
i^<br><br>
temperature at the iccaticn not much affected by local water<br><br>
temperature changes in the water jackets. This improves the accuracy in detecting the temperature of the engine body as a<br>
whole.<br>
Furthermore, the temperature sensor is disposed compactly in a space between, in the prescribed direction, the intake path and the cooling water piping connected to the pipe connection section.<br>
According to what is described in Claim 6, the air vent pipe is connected, in the prescribed direction, to the pipe connection section provided in the end portion of the cylinder head, so that the air vent pipe can be shortened as compared with a case in which it is connected to the radiator. This contributes toward making the layout of the cooling water piping, including the air vent pipe, disposed closer, in the prescribed direction, to the radiator than the end portion compact. Even though the temperature sensor is provided in the pipe connection section, it extends in a direction orthogonal to the prescribed direction. The air vent pipe can therefore be connected to the pipe connection section without being interfered with by the temperature sensor. This also contributes toward making the layout of the cooling water piping compact. [Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention]<br>

The space Rl formed between, in the lateral direction, the crank chamber 27 and the accessory chamber 30 accommodates a drive sprocket 43a of a transmission mechanism 43 for a valve system which drives a cam shaft 40a of a valve train 40 and a drive gear 33 of a transmission mechanism for accessories which drives an oil pump (not shown). [0013]<br>
Referring to Figs. 2, 4, and 5, the cylinder head 21 includes a combustion chamber 35 concavely formed in a location opposing the cylinder bore 20b in the cylinder axis direction, an intake port 36 and an exhaust port 37 both of which are open<br><br>
chamber 35, and a spark plug 38 exposed in the combustion chamber 35. A valve train chamber 39 formed by the cylinder head 21 and the head cover 22 accommodates the valve train 40 that drives an intake valve 41 to open and close the intake port 36 and an exhaust valve 42 to open and close the exhaust port 37.

The intake rocker arm 40c and the exhaust rocker arm 40d are rockably supported by rocker shafts 40b and rockingly driven by the intake cam 40al and the exhaust cam 40a2, respectively. The cam shaft 40a having a rotational axis La extending in parallel with the rotational axis Le is connected, via the transmission mechanism 43 that is of a wrapping connector type, to the crankshaft 26 and driven, by the crankshaft 26, at a rotational speed half that of the crankshaft 26. The transmission mechanism 43 includes a drive sprocket 43a formed integrally with the drive gear 33 and provided, as a driving part, on the crankshaft 26, a cam sprocket 43b provided, as a driven part, on the cam shaft 40a, and an endless chain 43c which, as an endless transmission part, connects the sprockets 43a and 43b. The intake cam 40al and exhaust cam 40a2 mounted on the rotary cam shaft 40a open and close the intake valve 41 and exhaust valve 42 via the intake rocker arm 40c and exhaust rocker arm 40d, respectively, at a prescribed timing in synchronization with the rotation of the crankshaft 2 6.<br><br>

" r~»  /.<br>
TH CHAIN 43 is vcund around the drive sprocket 43a disposed in the space Rl and the cam sprocket 43b disposed to extend from the space R3 to the valve train chamber 39. Thus, the chain 4 3c is disposed to extend, along the cylinder axis Ly, through the three spaces Rl, R2, and R3 in the chain chamber 44 . . [0015]<br>
Referring to Fig. 1, the internal combustion engine E includes: an intake device 45 which is provided with an air cleaner 45a, a throttle valve device 45b, and an intake pipe 45c connected to a connection portion 21i of the cylinder head 21 and which leads intake air to the combustion chamber 35; a fuel injection valve 47 which is attached to the intake pipe 45c and which provides the intake air with fuel; and an exhaust device 46 which is provided with an exhaust pipe 46a for leading the exhaust gas discharged from the exhaust port 37 to outside the internal combustion engine E and a silencer 46b. Referring also to Figs. 2, 4, and 6, the internal combustion engine E further includes a cooling device 50 which circulates cooling water for cooling the cylinder block 20 and the cylinder head 21. [0016]<br>
The intake air flowing through an intake path formed by the intake device 45 is, after undergoing flow control by the throttle valve 45bl provided in the throttle valve device 45b, mixed with the fuel supplied from the fuel injection valve 47 to become an air-fuel mixture. When the intake valve 41 opens, the air-fuel mixture flows into the combustion chamber 35<br><br>
through tne intake pert 36 ro be ignited by the spark plug 38 and burn. The pressure of the combustion gas generated by the burning of the air-fuel mixture drives the piston 24 causing the piston 24 to move reciprocally and thereby rotationally drive the crankshaft 26. Subsequently, when the exhaust valve 42 opens, the combustion gas flows out, as exhaust gas, to the exhaust port 37. The exhaust gas flowing out of the exhaust pcl"t 37 is discharged to the outside via the exhaust device 46 after flowing through the exhaust pipe 46a connected to a connection portion 21t, where the outlet of the exhaust port 37 is open, of the cylinder head 21. The power of the crankshaft 26 is automatically controlled by the transmission 15 according to the rotational speed of the engine and transmitted to the rear wheel 10 to rotationally drive it.

radiator 52, rhe shroud 54 covering the cooling fan 53, a radiator cover 55 which guides the cooling wind toward a radiator core 52c of the radiator 52, a thermostat 56 which establishes or shuts off cooling water communication between the radiator 52 and the water pump 51 so as to allow or prohibit cooling water circulation through the radiator 52 according to the state of warming up of the internal combustion engine E, and a grgup of plural cooling water pipes through which the cooling water circulates. [0018]<br>
The water pump 51 is attached to the right end portion 21e (serving also as a wall of the chain chamber 4 4), i.e. a rightward end portion toward the radiator 52, of the cylinder head 21 such that it is positioned closer to the radiator 52 than the chain chamber 44. The water pump 51 includes a body 51a coupled to the right end portion 21e, the body 51a having a cylindrical portion extending through the right end portion 21e into the chain chamber 44, a cover 51b which is coupled to the body 51a by bolts and provided with an intake port portion 51i and a discharge port portion 51e, a pump shaft 51c rotatably supported by the body 51a and coupled to an axial end portion of the cam shaft 40a, and an impeller 51d coupled to the pump shaft 51c and disposed in a pump chamber 51p formed by the body 51a and the cover 51b. [0019]<br>
The radi tor 52 is disposed separated from the engine body in the rightward direction as defined in the foregoing. The<br><br>
radiator 52 is disposed almost entirely, in the front-rear direction, rearward of r.he cylinder block 20 and the cylinder head 21 (see Fig. 3) to be, as seen from the right side (in the direcricn in which the cooling wind flows in) , overlapped with the crankcase 23. The AC generator 31 and the cooling fan 53 are disposed, on the right of the crankcase 23, between the chain chamber 44 and the radiator 52 (see Fig. 2).<br>
The radiator 52 is attached, via the shroud 54, to the right end portion 23e (serving also as a wall of the chain chamber 44), i.e. a rightward end portion toward the radiator 52, of the crankcase 23. The radiator 52 includes: an upper tank 52a, the upper tank 52a serving as an inlet tank provided with a connection portion 52i to which an inlet pipe 57 is connected, the inlet pipe 57 being for leading the high-temperature cooling water having circulated through the water jackets Jb and Jh and having thereby cooled the cylinder block 20 and the cylinder head 21 from the cylinder head 21 to the radiator 52; the radiator core 52c having a large number of heat transfer tubes 52cl into which the cooling water in the upper tank 52a flows; and a lower tank 52b serving as an outlet tank where the low-temperature cooling water having radiated heat in the radiator core 52c and flowing out of the heat transfer tubes 52cl collects. The lower tank 52b is provided with an outlet connection portion 52e to which an outlet pipe 58 for leading, via the thermostat 56, the cooling water having radiated heat to the intake port portion 51i of the water pump 51 is connected.<br>
The inlet connection portion 52i and the outlet connection portion 52e are provided, in the upper tank 52a and the lower<br><br>

_ \J<br>
tank 62b respectively   in portions toward, in the front-rear direcricn (in the cylinder axis direction), a cooling water cutlet portion 61 and a cooling water inlet portion 62, respectively (see Fig. 3). [0020]<br>
Referring to Fig. 2, the cooling fan 53 coupled to the drive shaft 29 via a rotor 31b of the AC generator 31 is disposed, in the rotational axis direction, between the rotor 31b and the radiator core 52c. The cooling fan 53 having a large number of vanes 53a is of a radial flow type. It is disposed, in the cooling wind path formed by the radiator cover 55 and the shroud 54, downstream of the radiator core 52c to face, in the rotational axis direction, the radiator core 52c. It sucks in the air having passed the radiator core 52c, thereby causing air to flow into the radiator core 52c as a cooling wind from upstream (from the right side).<br>
The shroud 54 is a single part made of a synthetic resin. It includes a holding portion 54a which holds the radiator 52 and a cylindrical cover portion 54b covering a radially outer circumference of the cooling fan 53. The cover portion 54b includes a wind outlet 54e having plural circumferentially spaced-apart slits each formed approximately in parallel with the rotational axis Le (see Fig. 2). The cooling wind forced out of the accessory chamber 30 by the cooling fan 53 is radially outwardly discharged via the wind outlet 54e.<br>

[0021]<br>
Referring to Figs. 3 to 7, the thermostat 56 is attached to the right end portion 20e (serving also as a wall of the chain chamber 44), i.e. a rightward end portion toward the radiator 52, of the cylinder block 20, so that it is disposed, in the rightward direction, closer to the radiator 52 than the chain chamber 44. In the front-rear direction, the thermostat 56 is disposed between the water pump 51 and the radiator 52 (see Fig. 3) . The thermostat 56 includes a housing 56a coupled to the right end portion 20e and a thermostat valve (not shown) which operates being controlled by a temperature sensitive element housed in the housing 56a- The housing 56a is provided with a bypass port portion 56b into which the cooling water from the cylinder head water jacket Jh flows, an inlet port portion 56i which guides the cooling water from the radiator 52 into the housing 56a, and an outlet port portion 56e through which the cooling water from the radiator 52 flows out to the water pump 51.<br>
When the internal combustion engine E is being warmed up, the thermostat valve allows the cooling water to flow from the bypass port portion 56b to the outlet port portion 56e whereas shutting off the cooling water path between the inlet port portion 56i and the outlet port portion 56e. After the internal combustion engine E has been warmed up, the thermostat valve allows the cooling water to flow from the inlet port portion 56i to the outlet port portion 56e whereas shutting off the<br><br><br>
the right end portion 21e of the cylinder head 21 while also falling in an upper end portion 21u of the cylinder head 21, toward the cylinder block 20 in the cylinder axis direction. The pipe connection section 70 includes a portion bulging, upwardly (or bulging in one direction orthogonal (hereinafter referred to as an "orthogonal direction") to the cylinder axis Ly as seen from the right side). [0023]<br>
The inlet pipe 57 is connected to the cooling water outlet portion 61 that is provided in the right end portion 21e while also falling in the upper end portion 21u. The inlet pipe 57 leads the cooling water having flowed out of the cylinder block water jacket Jb into the cylinder head water jacket Jh and having thereby cooled the cylinder head 21 to the radiator 52. The cooling water outlet portion 61 projecting rightward from the right end portion 21e or the pipe connection section 70 is disposed, in the rightward direction, closer to the radiator 52 than the chain chamber 44 (see Figs. 5 and 7). The cooling water outlet portion 61 is open to an upwardly projecting upper end portion Jhl of the cylinder head water jacket Jh (see Fig. 5) . The upper end portion Jhl is formed by the pipe connection section 70. The pipe connection section 70 and the upper end<br><br><br>
The pipe connection section 70 integrally includes an outlet forming portion 71 and a fixing section 72 . The cooling water outlet portion 61 includes a pipe joint attached to the outlet forming portion 71, The outlet forming portion 71 has a projecting portion which, in the right end portion 21e, projects rightwardly from the pipe connection section 70. The outlet forming portion 71 is positioned more rightwardly, hence, closer to the radiator 52, than the chain chamber 44. The outlet forming portion 71 has an end face 71a positioned closer to the radiator 52 than the chain chamber 44. The inlet pipe 57 is connected to the cooling water output portion 61 from the right side at a location rightward of the end face 71a. [0025]<br>
The fixing section 72 for a temperature sensor 66 which detects the cooling water temperature is provided near the cooling water outlet portion 61. The temperature sensor 66 has a detection part 66b which is exposed near the upper end portion Jhl of the cylinder head water jacket Jh. The temperature sensor 66 is fixed to the right end portion 21e of the cylinder head 21, that is, to be more concrete, to the pipe connection section 70 from the right side.<br><br>
The ceding water cutlet portion 61 is an outlet through which rhe cooling water flows out of the cylinder head water jacket Jh toward the radiator 52. Hence, the upper end portion Jhl is where the cooling water having circulated through the water jackets Jb and Jh collects before flowing out of the engine main body toward the radiator 52. The upper end portion Jhl is therefore a portion not much affected by local water temperature changes in the water jackets Jb and Jh. This allows the temperature sensor 66 to accurately detect the temperature of the engine body as a whole.<br>
The fixing section 72, like the outlet forming portion 71, projects rightwardly in the right end portion 21e, and is positioned rightward of the chain chamber 44. The temperature sensor 66 has an exposed part 66a extending rightwardly outside the cylinder head 21. [0026]<br>
The inlet pipe 57 includes a conduit 57a connected to the cooling water outlet portion 61, a conduit 57b connected to the inlet connection portion 52i, and a T-shaped pipe joint 57c which includes a branching portion connecting the conduits 57a and 57b, The inlet pipe 57 is provided with a conduit 59b branching from the pipe joint 57c to be connected to the bypass port portion 56b. A bypass pipe 59 communicated with the cylinder head water jacket Jh includes the conduits 59b and 57a and the pipe joint 57c. When the internal combustion engine E is being warmed up, the bypass pipe 59 leads the cooling water from the cylinder head water jacket Jh to the water pump 51 via the thermostat 56 without letting the cooling water flow into rhe radiator 52.<br><br>
The curlet pipe 5c is connected zo the intake port portion 51i extending, in the front-rear direction, toward the radiator 52. The outlet pipe 58 leads the low-temperature cooling water from the radiator 52 to the water pump 51 via the thermostat 56. The outlet pipe 58 includes a conduit 58a which is connected to the outlet connection portion 52e and the inlet port portion 56i and a conduit 58b which is connected to the outlet port portion 56e and the intake port portion 51i.<br>
A supply pipe 60 is connected between the discharge port portion 51e and the cooling water inlet portion 62 provided in a lower end portion 20d of the cylinder block 20. The supply pipe 60 leads the cooling water that is, after flowing in from the radiator 52, discharged from the water pump 51 to the cylinder block water jacket Jb. The cooling water inlet portion 62 is open to a lower end portion Jbl of the cylinder block water jacket Jb (see Fig. 4) .<br>
The inlet pipe 57, outlet pipe 58, bypass pipe 59, and supply pipe 60 are cooling water pipes. The inlet pipe 57, outlet pipe 58, and bypass pipe 59 are positioned more rightwardly, that is, closer to the radiator 52, than the right end portion 21e of the cylinder head 21. [0027]<br>
The cooling water pumped out by the water pump 51 of the cooling device 50 flows from the cooling water inlet portion 62 into the cylinder block water jacket Jb via the supply pipe 60 and cools the cylinder 20a. The cooling water then flows into rhe cylinder head water jacket Jh and cools the cylinder head 21. Subsequently, the cooling water flows out of the cylinder<br><br><br>
After the internal combustion engine E has been warmed up in a state where the thermostat 56 effects control such that the cylinder head water jacket Jh and the water pump 51 are communicated with each other via the radiator 52 and such that communication between the cylinder head water jacket Jh and the water pump 51 via the bypass pipe 59 is shut off, the cooling water cooled by radiating heat in the radiator 52 is sucked in by the water pump 51 and the cooling water pressure-fed by the impeller 51d flows into the cylinder block water jacket Jb via the supply pipe 60 to cool the cylinder block 20. The cooling water then flows into the cylinder head water jacket Jh and cools the cylinder head 21. The cooling water flowing out of the cylinder head water jacket Jh further flows from the cooling water outlet portion 61 into the upper tank 52a of the radiator 52 via the inlet pipe 57. After being cooled by the cooling wind at the radiator core 52c, the cooling water flows into the lower tank 52b. Subsequently, the cooling water flowing out of the lower tank 52b flows into the pump chamber 51p via the outlet pipe 58 and the thermostat 56 to be then pressure-fed by the impeller 51d. The cooling water thus circulates the circulation path for use after a warm-up operation, thereby cooling the<br><br><br>
jacket Jh from the cylinder block water jacket Jb to the radiator 52. The cooling water outlet portion 61 is disposed rightwardly closer to the radiator 52 than the chain chamber 44, so that the cooling water having, after cooling the cylinder block 20, flowed into the cylinder head water jacket Jh and having thereby cooled the cylinder head 21 need not be made to go through the cylinder block 20 again before being sent out to the radiator 52. This simplifies the water circulation structure in the cylinder block 20 and makes the cylinder block 20 smaller. Furthermore, since the cooling water outlet portion 61 is disposed rightwardly closer to the radiator 52 than the chain chamber 44, the inlet pipe 57 can be shortened to reduce its line resistance and improve cooling efficiency. This allows the inlet pipe 57 to be laid out compactly. Still furthermore, with the cooling water outlet portion 61 projecting rightwardly in the right end portion 21e and being provided in the outlet forming portion 71 that is positioned closer to the radiator<br><br>
52 that the  chain chamber 44, the inlet pipe 57 can be further shortened by a length equivalenr to rhe length of the outlet forming portion 71. This further reduces the line resistance of the inlet pipe 5 7. [00291<br>
The cooling water outlet portion 61 is open to the upper end portion Jhl of the cylinder head water jacket Jh. The cooling water inlet portion 62 through which the cooling water h.-:.ving radiated heat at the radiator 52 flows into the cylinder block water jacket Jb is provided in the lower end portion 20d of the cylinder block 20. In this configuration, the cooling water flowing in from the lower end portion 20d enters the cylinder head water jacket Jh after flowing through the cylinder block water jacket Jb and subsequently flows out through the upper end portion Jhl of the cylinder head water jacket Jh to the radiator 52. Thus, the cooling water circulates smoothly, so that the cylinder block 20 and the cylinder head 21 are cooled with improved efficiency- Moreover, with the upper end portion Jhl being an upwardly projecting portion of the cylinder head water jacket Jh, the cooling water that enters the cylinder head water jacket Jh flows out to the cooling water outlet portion 61 via the upper end portion Jhl after thoroughly cooling the cylinder head 21. This contributes toward improving the cooling efficiency for the cylinder head 21. [0030]<br>
The cooling device 50 is provided with the water pump 51 and the thermostat 56 that are attached to the right end portions 21e and 20e, respectively, to be rightwardly closer to the<br><br>
zr   52 than the chain chamber 44. In rhis configuration, even chough the chain chamber 44 is disposed between, in the lateral direction, the water jackets Jb and Jh and the radiator 52 in the engine body, nhe cooling water outlet portion 61, the water pump 51, and the thermostat 56 are concentratedly disposed close to the radiator 52. Therefore, the inlet pipe 57 and the outlet pipe 58 can be shortened to improve cooling efficiency and their layout can be made compact. Furthermore, the radiator 52, the thermostat 56, and the water pump 51 are attached to different parts, i.e. the crankcase 23, the cylinder block 20, and the cylinder head 21. This contributes toward shortening the inlet pipe 57 and the outlet pipe 58 to improve cooling efficiency and making their layout compact. [0031]<br>
The pipe connection section 70 including the cooling water outlet portion 61 is provided in the right end portion 21e of the cylinder head 21. The temperature sensor 66 is attached to the fixing section 72 of the pipe connection section 70 that includes the cooling water outlet portion 61 through which the cooling water from the cylinder head water jacket Jh flows toward the radiator 52. Thus, in the cylinder head water jacket Jh, the temperature sensor 66 is disposed at a location where the cooling water having circulated through the water jackets Jb and Jh collects before flowing out of the engine main body taward the radiator 52. This allows the temperature sensor 66 to detect the cooling water temperature at the location not much affected by local water temperature changes in the water jackets Jb and Jh, so that the temperature of the engine body as a whole can<br><br>
be detected   with improved accuracy. [ 0032]<br>
A second embodiment of the present invention will be described below with reference to Figs. 8 and 9. In the second emibodiment, the cooling water piping for the cooling device 50 and the temperature sensor 66 are provided in different positions than in the first embodiment. In other respects, the first and second embodiments are basically identically configured. In the following, the second embodiment will be described centering on aspects differing from the first embodiment, and parts which are identical between the two embodiments will not be described or will be described only briefly. Also, components, including those not shown, of the second embodiment which are identical with or similar to those used in the first embodiment are assigned the same, reference numerals as in the first embodiment. [0033]<br>
The intake device 45 includes the throttle valve device 45b having a throttle body 45b2 connected to the air cleaner 45a (see Fig. 1), the intake pipe 45c that leads the intake air coming through the throttle valve device 45b to the intake port 36 (see Fig. 4), and a connection pipe 45d which is made of a flexible rubber pipe and which, being positioned between the throttle valve device 45b and the intake pipe 45c, connects the two. An intake path 45p which leads the intake air to the intake port 36 and further to the combustion chamber 35 (see Fig. 4) is formed by the throttle body 45b2 that is a body of the throttle valve device 45b, the connection pipe 45d, and the intake pipe<br><br>
45c. the downstream end portion of the intake parh 45p is open to the intake port 36. The intake pipe 45c is coupled, by bolts 18, to the connection portion 21i provided in the upper end portion 21u of the cylinder head 21.<br>
The intake path 45p extends, as shown in Fig. 9 showing a view seen in a direction approximately parallel to the one orthogonal direction, in the cylinder axis direction such that its longitudinal direction coincides with the cylinder axis direction as seen in a top plan view (or as seen in the one orthogonal direction). [0034]<br>
An air vent pipe 69 for letting out the air accumulated in the pump chamber 51p of the water pump 51 that is attached to the right end portion 21e is positioned rightwardly closer to the radiator 52 than the right end portion 21e and the chain chamber 44. The air vent pipe 69 is connected, on its upstream side, to a connection portion 51f provided in the cover 51b of the water pump 51 and communicated with the pump chamber 51p of the water pump 51 (see Fig. 2) . On its downstream side, the air vent pipe 6 9 is connected to the pipe connection section 70 and communicated with the upper end portion Jhl of the cylinder head water jacket Jh (see Fig. 5). [0035]<br>
The pipe connection section 70 formed integrally with the cylinder head 21 in the same position as in the first embodiment integrally includes the outlet forming portion 71, a fixing section 73, and an air inflow form.ing portion 74. The pipe connection section 70 forms, the same as in the first embodiment.<br><br>
the upper end portion  Jhl of the cylinder head water jacket Jh . The air inflcw forming portion 74 is connected with the air vent<br>
pipe 69 that leads the air in the water pump 51 to the cylinder head water jacket Jh. [0036]<br>
A cooling water cutlet portion 67, which is equivalent to the cooling water outlet portion 61 used in the first embodiment, includes a T-shaped pipe joint having a branching portion connected to the outlet forming portion 71 . An air inflow portion 68 includes a pipe joint attached to the air inflow forming portion 74. A pair of branching portions of the cooling water outlet portion 67 are connected with the inlet pipe 57 and the bypass pipe 59, respectively. With the bypass pipe 59 directly connected to the cooling water outlet portion 67, as compared with a case in which a bypass pipe is provided in an intermediate portion of the inlet pipe, the inlet pipe 57 can be further shortened and the layout of the inlet pipe 57 can be made more compact. [0037]<br>
The outlet forming portion 71 and the air inflow forming portion 74 each include a projecting portion which is projecting rightwardly from the pipe connection section 70 in the right end portion 21e. They are located rightward of the chain chamber 44 to be closer to the radiator 52 than the chain chamber 44. The outlet forming portion 71 and the air inflow forming portion 74 have the end face 71a and an end face 74a, respectively, both of which are disposed closer to the radiator 52 than the chain chamber 44. The inlet pipe 57 is connected ro the cooling water<br><br>
outlet portion 67 from theright side at a location rightward of the end face 71a. The air vent pipe 69 is connected to the air inflow portion 68 from the right side at a location rightward of the end face 74a.<br>
The inlet pipe 57 extends from the cooling water outlet portion 67 to the connection portion 52i of the radiator 52 without being bent in a direction opposite to the rightward direction (that is, without being bent in the leftward direction) (see Fig. 9) . This also allows the inlet pipe 57 to be shortened and its line resistance to be reduced. The air vent pipe 69 is disposed directly below the inlet pipe 57 and the bypass pipe 59 such that it is overlapped with the inlet pipe 57 and the bypass pipe 59 as seen in a top plan view.<br>
[0038]<br>
In the pipe connection section 70, the fixing section 73 for the temperature sensor 55 is provided in the vicinity of the outlet forming portion 71, cooling water outlet portion 57, air inflow forming portion 74, and air inflow portion 58. The temperature sensor 65 has the detection part 56b (see Fig. 5) exposed near the upper end portion Jhl.<br>
The fixing section 73 projects upwardly in the right end portion 21e. The exposed part 55a of the temperature sensor 55 fixed to the fixing section 73 from above extends upwardly to be orthogonal to the rightward direction as seen from the right side (namely, as seen in a right side view like that of Fig. 8) (i.e. in the one orthogonal direction).<br>
[0039]<br>
The temperature sensor 66 and the intake path 45p are,<br><br><br>
in a top plan viev, disposed side by side in the lateral direction. To be more concrete, as seen in a top plan view, the temperature sensor 66 is disposed in a space surrounded by the intake path 45p and the inlet pipe 57 and bypass pipe 59 that are, in the pipe connection section 70, connected to the cooling water outlet portion 67 such that the temperature sensor 66 lies along with the intake path 45p in the rightward direction, i.e. , in the direction toward the radiator 52 as seen from the intake path 45p. The pipe connection section 70, the upper end portion Jhl, the fixing section 73, and the exposed part 66a are arranged such that at least a part of them, that is, in the present embodiment, an almost whole of the fixing section 73, upper end portion Jhl, and exposed part 66a is overlapped with the chain chamber 44 as seen in a top plan view or positioned identically with the chain chamber 44 in the lateral direction (see Fig. 9) . The temperature sensor 66 is disposed downward of the topmost portions of the throttle body 45b2 and connection pipe 45d, respectively, as seen in the vertical direction (or in the orthogonal direction) (see Fig. 8). [0040]<br>
Along with the air to be let out, the cooling water also passes the air vent pipe 69, so that the air vent pipe 69 is, like the inlet pipe 57, a pipe for cooling water.<br>
The thermostat 56 and the water pump 51 are connected together by coupling, using bolts, a flange 56n formed integrally with the housing 56a of the thermostat 56 and a flange 51n of a connection pipe 51m formed integrally with the cover 51b of the water pump 51.<br><br>
The second embodiment configured similarly to the first embodiment can realize the following operations and effects in addition to   effects similar to those realized by the first embodiment.<br>
The temperature sensor 66 attached to the right end portion 21e of the cylinder head 21 extends upwardly, that is, in a direction orthogonal to the rightward direction outside the cylinder head 21 (i.e. in the one orthogonal direction) . Thus, with the temperature sensor 66, even though being attached to the right end portion 21e, extending upwardly outside the cylinder head 21, the exposed part 66a exposed outside the cylinder head 21 of the temperature sensor 66 is prevented from interfering with the layout of such cooling water pipes as the inlet pipe 57 and the bypass pipe 59 disposed closer to the radiator 52 than the right end portion 21e. This promotes compactly laying out the cooling water piping. [0042]<br>
The intake path 45p formed by the intake device 45 extends along the cylinder axis direction of the cylinder block 20 as seen in a top plan view. The pipe connection section 70 including the cooling water outlet portion 67 is provided in the right end portion 21e. The temperature sensor 66 is fixed to the fixing section 73 of the pipe connection section 70 in a location, as seen in the rightward direction, between the intake path 45p and the inlet pipe 57 and bypass pipe 59 that are connected, allowing the cooling water to pass through them, to the cooling water outlet portion 67 in the pipe connection section 70. Thus,<br><br>
the temperature sensor 66 is attached to the pipe         connection section 70 including the cutlet forming portion 71 where the cooling water outlet portion 67 is provided^ the cooling water outlet porticn 67 being an outlet for the cooling water flowing from the cylinder head water jacket Jh tc the radiator 52. This, as in the case of the first embodiment, improves the accuracy in detecting the temperature of the engine body as a whole.<br>
Furthermore, the temperature sensor 66 is disposed in a space between, as seen in the rightward direction, the intake path 45p and the inlet pipe 57 and bypass pipe 59 that are connected to the cooling water outlet portion 67 in the pipe connection section 70. Thus, the temperature sensor 66 can be compactly disposed. [0043]<br>
The air vent pipe 69 for letting out the air accumulated in the water pump 51 that is attached to the right end portion 21e in a location rightwardly closer to the radiator 52 than the chain chamber 44 is connected to the right end portion 21e and communicated with the cylinder head water jacket Jh. Thus, in the cylinder head 21, the air vent pipe 69 is connected to the right end portion 21e to which the water pump 51 is also attached. The air vent pipe 69 can, therefore, be shortened as compared with a case in which it is connected to the radiator 52. This contributes toward making the layout of the air vent pipe 69 and other pipes such as the inlet pipe 57 and bypass pipe 59 disposed closer, in the rightward direction, to the radiator 52 than the right end portion 21e compact.<br><br>
In the air inflow forming portion 74 of the pipe connection section 70 having the fixing secrion 73 to which the temperature sensor 66 is attached, the air vent pipe 69 is connected to the air inflow pcrticn 68 from the right side and communicated with the cylinder head water jacket Jh . In this arrangement, the air vent pipe 69 can be connected to the pipe connection section 70 without being interfered with by the temperature sensor 66, as the temperature sensor 66, even though'being provided in the pipe connection section 70, extends upwardly. This also contributes toward making the layout of the air vent pipe 69 and inlet pipe 57 compact. [0045]<br>
The fixing section 73 is disposed to overlap with the chain chamber 44 as seen in a top plan view. Namely, the fixing section 73 is disposed making use of a portion forming the chain chamber 44 of the cylinder head 21. Thus, the fixing section 73 is formed without causing the cylinder head 21 to be enlarged in the lateral direction. [0046]<br>
In the following, partial modifications of the above embodiments will be described as to configurational modifications.<br>
