The present invention relates to the field of agriculture. Particularly it relates to an agricultural implement used for cultivating the land. More particularly it relates to a multi drill cultivator being used for cultivating or ploughing the land for agricultural and gardening purpose.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Agriculture in India is one of the most prominent sectors in its economy. About 70% population of the India is directly dependent on agriculture, also agriculture is the main component for most of the state economies in India.<br>
Since time immemorial, when human race learnt farming, the plough farming with bullocks or other animals is in use. The farmer remains occupied for the whole day. With the routine plough, currently in use, the farmer is able to plough only one furrow at a time. And even for this one furrow, the prime mover animal has to strain a lot. In addition, at every end of a furrow, the farmer has to lift up the plough and put it in a new direction of next furrow.<br>
Then came the era of mechanized agriculture whereby, tractor became the leader with "high speed cultivation".<br><br>
But all farmers cannot afford tractor, because of higher cost with all its taxes and insurance, year after year depreciating price, necessity of a trained and paid personnel to drive the vehicle, running fuel and oil cost and maintenance expenses of spares as well as labour. Consumption of diesel and oil has an impact on national economy because of hidden foreign exchange expenditure. In addition, usage of diesel in any form means some degree of pollution, adversely affecting the ecology. Leaking of diesel or oil from the engine, if any, would spoil our soil, and as with other four wheelers, fatal accidents to occur is not an exception. Till date, by alleviating the use of cattle in agriculture, this mechanized agriculture has pushed many animals to slaughter houses.<br>
Thus for establishing a balanced ecology with qualitative growth, there was an exigency to invent an equipment to uplift the farmers and cattle force of India.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a cultivator which will overcome all the deficiencies associated with the prior art cultivation mechanisms.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide an eco-friendly, mainly<br>

energy source with low energy profile and which ultimately improves qualitative growth and eco development.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a multi drill cultivator which plough faster and save lot of time of farmer by producing multifold workoutput.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a multi drill cultivator, which is very economic.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a multi drill cultivator, which is eco-friendly and improves and protects environment from pollution since there is no use of fuel in such cultivator.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a multi drill cultivator, which is easy to operate. No special skill is necessary to operate such cultivator.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a multi drill cultivator that is easy to maintain .<br><br>

Referring to figure 1, the multi drill cultivator (1) consists of a horizontal cylinder shaped part (2) having dimensions of 914 mm horizontally and 457.4 mm vertically. The horizontal cylinder part (2) consists of a cover (19) at top which is openable. A gearbox is provided inside,the cylinder shaped part (2). On the body of said cylinder shaped part (2) minimum four projected portions (7, 8, 9, 10) are provided. These projected portions (7, 8, 9, 10) are connected internally to gearbox.<br>
The cylinder shaped part (2) is mounted within a pentagonal chassis (3). The<br>
cylinder shaped part (2) is rolled on ground with the help of three wheels - two<br>
rear wheels (4, 5) being provided by the sides of said cylinder shaped part (2)<br>
and one (6) in front.  The said wheel (6) is connected with the help of wheel<br>
bracket (20). Each outwardly projected portions (7, 8, 9, 10) is provided with<br>
drill (11, 12, 13, 14), each of 375 mm long. These drills (11, 12, 13, 14) face<br><br>
     towards front wheel (6). The angulation of projected rotating drills (11, 12, 13, 14) is done by jackscrew mechanism (15), which is operated through a transverse bar (16) at the top, in front of seat (18).<br>
The multi drill cultivator (1) of the present invention further comprises a 1305 mm long towing bar (17) fixed near the top of front wheel (6) by universal joint where on each side one bullock is harnessed with the help of a wooden cross bar, conventionally used by the farmer. The movement of the cultivator can be achieved by animals and prime mover also.<br>
A seat (18) is provided on top of horizontal cylinder shaped part (2). The farmer rides on a seat (18) fixed on openable top cover of horizontal cylinder shaped part (2) and drives the bullocks in a direction proposed to be cultivated. With help of jack screw (15), by rotating the top mounted transverse bar (16), the farmer brings down the cultivating drills (11, 12, 13,1 4) at required depth.<br>
As the bullocks walk further, the wheel motion through gearbox within the cylinder shaped part (2) rotates all four drills (11, 12, 13, 14) along with its long axis and start making one to four furrows at a time, according to number of drills fitted. Each furrow 22 centimeters apart and of 10 to 20 centimeters depth, depending upon land hardness and strength of prime mover. Considering 0.91 meter width being cultivated at a time with all four drills, 1200<br><br>
meters walk of prime mover animal will cultivate one acre in 30 to 40 minutes time.<br>
The cultivator (1) does cultivation using renewable energy source. As a prime mover animals are used with this cultivator (1) and the animals are fed with readily available vegetarian sources of food. Thus utilization of renewable energy source would fulfill the global demand of energy resources.<br>
The cultivator (1) indirectly saves animals. By enhancing the use of such multi drill cultivators, farmers, will be tempted to keep more cattle and will take greater care of them, thus preventing them going to slaughter houses.<br>
ADVANTAGES OF THE MULTI DRILL CULTIVATOR OF THE PRESNET INVENTION:<br>
, i. Multi drill cultivator of present invention do cultivation much faster saving lot of time of the farmer. This machine does up to four furrows at a time rather than one in prior traditional ploughing. Thus, it produces four-fold work output.<br>
ii.     Being a purely mechanical machine and using cattle as a prime<br>
mover, there are no recurrent expenses of fuel and oil. There is only<br>
one time purchase cost and easy economical maintenance for the<br>
farmer to bear.<br><br>
iii. It does cultivation at "zero pollution". As there is no usage of any fuel there is zero pollution.<br>
iv. It does cultivation using renewable energy source. As prime mover animals are fed with readily available vegetarian sources would fulfill the global demand of energy resources.<br>
