				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a flashlight generating<br>
circuit for generating a flashlight.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
Conventionally, a camera, which emits a flashlight in<br>
synchronization with a shutter action so as to take a photograph<br>
of a subject in the case where a brightness of the subject is<br>
insufficient, is known. Such a camera is provided with a<br>
flashlight generating circuit for generating a flashlight.<br>
Fig. 14 is a diagram of a conventional flashlight<br>
generating circuit.<br>
A flashlight generating circuit 200 shown in Fig. 14 is<br>
provided with a step-up circuit 211 which is connected to an<br>
internal battery 1 for controlling the whole camera. This<br>
step-up circuit 211 rises a voltage from the internal battery<br>
1 to a predetermined voltage.<br>
In addition, the flashlight generating circuit 200 is<br>
provided with a main capacitor 213 for storing an electric power<br>
stepped up by the step-up circuit 211 via a diode 212. A (-)<br>
side of the main capacitor 213 is connected to an anode side<br>
of the diode 212, and a cathode side of the diode 212 is connected<br>
to a (-) output side of the step-up circuit 211. Moreover, a<br>
( + ) side of the main capacitor 213 is connected to a ( + ) output<br>
side of the step-up circuit 211. Further, a resistance element<br><br>
214	and a trigger switch 215 are connected to the (-) side and<br>
the (+) side of the main capacitor 213 in series, and an arc<br>
tube 216 is arranged parallel to the main capacitor 213. The<br>
arc tube 216 has an anode 216a and a cathode 216b and a side<br>
electrode 216c, and a xenon (XE) gas is sealed in the inside<br>
of the arc tube 216.<br>
Furthermore, the flashlight generating circuit 200 is<br>
provided with a trigger coil 218 which is composed of a primary-<br>
side winding 218a with a predetermined winding number and a<br>
secondary side winding 218b with a larger winding number.-. One<br>
end of the primary side winding 218a is connected to a connection<br>
point between the resistance element 214 and the trigger switch<br>
215	via a trigger-use capacitor 217. On the other hand, one<br>
end of the secondary side winding 218b is connected to the side<br>
electrode 216c of the arc tube 216. The other end of the primary<br>
side winding 218a and the other end of the secondary side winding<br>
218b are_connected commonly to the anode 216a of the arc tube<br>
216.<br>
In the flashlight generating circuit 200 having the above<br>
structure, at first the electric power from the internal battery<br>
1 is stepped up by the step-up circuit 211 in a state that the<br>
trigger switch 215 is opened. The stepped-up electric power<br>
is stored in the main capacitor 213 via the diode 212. Moreover,<br>
the stepped-up electric power is also stored in the trigger-use<br>
capacitor 217 via the primary side winding 218a, the trigger-use<br>
capacitor 217, the resistance element 214 and the diode 212.<br>
Next, the trigger switch 215 is closed in synchronization<br><br>
with the action of the shutter of the camera when taking a picture.<br>
The electric power stored in the trigger-use capacitor 217 is<br>
discharged. As a result, an electric current flows in the<br>
primary side winding 218a, and an electromotive force is caused<br>
in the secondary side winding 218b. Here, since a winding<br>
number of the secondary side winding 218b is larger than a<br>
winding number of the primary side winding 218a, the<br>
electromotive force which is caused in the secondary side<br>
winding 218b is amplified so as to be large. Since this large<br>
electromotive force is given as a trigger voltage to the,side<br>
electrode 216c of the arc tube 216, the xenon gas sealed in the<br>
arc tube 216 is excited. As a result, the electric power stored<br>
in the main capacitor 213 is discharged via a discharge loop<br>
L of the (+) side of the main capacitor 213, the anode 216a,<br>
the cathode 216b and the (-) side of the main capacitor 213 so<br>
that a flashlight is generated from the arc tube 216. In such<br>
a manner_,. the flashlight is emitted.<br>
Fig. 15 is a diagram of a conventional flashlight<br>
generating circuit which is different from the flashlight<br>
generating circuit shown in Fig. 14. Here, the same reference<br>
numerals are given to the components which are the same as those<br>
of the flashlight generating circuit 200 shown in Fig. 14.<br>
The ( + ) output side of the step-up circuit 211 composing<br>
the flashlight generating circuit 210 is connected to the (+)<br>
side of the main capacitor 213 via the diode 212, and the (-)<br>
output side of the step-up circuit 211 is connected to the (-)<br>
side of the main capacitor 213 . Further, the resistance element<br><br>
214 and the trigger switch 219 which are connected in series<br>
are arranged on the ( + ) side and the (-) side of the main<br>
capacitor 213. Moreover, the ( + ) side and the (-) side of the<br>
main capacitor 213 are connected to the anode 216a and the<br>
cathode 216b of the arc tube 216. The connection point between<br>
the resistance element 214 and the trigger switch 219 is<br>
connected to one end of the primary side winding 218a of the<br>
trigger coil 218 via the trigger-use capacitor 217, and the one<br>
end of the secondary side winding 218b of the trigger coil 218<br>
is connected to the side electrode 216c of the arc tube 216.<br>
The respective other ends of the primary side winding 218a and<br>
the secondary side winding 218b are connected commonly to the<br>
cathode 216b of the arc tube 216.<br>
In the flashlight generating circuit 210 having the above<br>
structure, when the trigger switch 219 is closed, the electric<br>
power stored in the trigger-use capacitor 217 is discharged.<br>
As a result, an electric current flows in the primary side<br>
winding 218a and a strong electromotive force is generated in<br>
the secondary side winding 218b. This electromotive force is<br>
given as a trigger voltage to the side electrode 216c of the<br>
arc tube 218 , and a xenon gas sealed in the arc tube 216 is excited.<br>
The electric power stored in the main capacitor 213 is<br>
discharged through the discharge loop of the (+) side of the<br>
main capacitor 213, the anode 216a, the cathode 216b and the<br>
(-) side of the main capacitor 213 so that a flashlight is<br>
generated from the arc tube 216.<br>
In the above-mentioned flashlight generating circuit 200<br><br>
or 210, when the trigger switch 215 or 219 is closed and a trigger<br>
voltage is given to the arc tube 216, electric discharge starts<br>
to take place instantaneously in the arc tube 216, and the light<br>
emission takes an abrupt rising light emission curve<br>
(hereinafter, referred to as abrupt light emission curve), in<br>
which a peak light amount is large and light emitting time is<br>
short, so as to be ended. As for the light emission in such<br>
an abrupt light emission curve, it is generally difficult to<br>
control exposure by means of the flashlight accurately in a near<br>
distance. Particularly in an automatically adjusted<br>
flashlight generating apparatus having an exposure adjusting<br>
circuit for controlling to stop the emission of the flashlight<br>
at the time of reaching a predetermined light amount, since the<br>
flashlight emission duration is too short, a delay of the<br>
response in the exposure adjusting circuit cannot follow the<br>
emission of the flashlight when a light amount is adjusted.<br>
Therefore, there arises a problem that the adjustment of a light<br>
amount in the automatically adjusted flashlight generating<br>
apparatus is difficult.<br>
In addition, in order to stop the emission of the<br>
flashlight during the emission, a non-contact switch is<br>
arranged in the discharge loop via the arc tube 216, and the<br>
non-contact switch is turned off so as to stop the light emission.<br>
This technique is known, but in order to obtain a predetermined<br>
light amount of the flashlight with short light emission<br>
connection time, an extremely great electric current flows . As<br>
a result, it is necessary to adopt a large-sized and expensive<br><br>
non-contact switch arranged in the discharge loop which can<br>
«<br>
withstand the great electric current.<br>
Further, in the light emission with abrupt light emission<br>
curve, a color temperature of the flashlight is high, and a light<br>
having much blue component is emitted. In photography, in order<br>
to correct such a blue component of the light, it is necessary<br>
to arrange a protector, for example, composed by coloring a<br>
transparent plate before a light emitting section. There<br>
arises a problem that the cost rises.<br>
In order to solve these problems, there suggests a<br>
technique that a choke coil is added into the discharge loop<br>
so that the light emission curve becomes gentle.<br>
Fig. 16 is a diagram of a conventional flashlight<br>
generating circuit which is constituted so that a choke coil<br>
is connected to a main capacitor in series and a thyristor is<br>
connected to an arc tube parallel.<br>
In_a flashlight generating circuit 220 shown in Fig. 16,<br>
a choke coil 221 is connected to the main capacitor 213 in series.<br>
Moreover, a thyristor 222 is connected to the arc tube 216<br>
parallel. A gate of the thyristor 222 is connected to a control<br>
terminal 224 for controlling on/off operation of the thyristor<br>
222. Moreover, a resistance element 223 for adjusting a gate<br>
voltage of the thyristor 222 is provided on the gate of the<br>
thyristor 222 and the (-) side of the main capacitor 213.<br>
In this flashlight generating circuit 220, at the first<br>
time when a power of the camera is turned on, a control signal<br>
of 'L' level is input into the control terminal 224, and the<br><br>
thyristor 222 is in the off state. Moreover, an electric power<br>
«<br>
is stored in both the main capacitor 213 and the trigger-use<br>
capacitor 217.<br>
When the trigger switch 219 is closed, the electric power<br>
stored in the trigger-use capacitor 217 is discharged, and an<br>
electric current flows in the primary side winding 218a and an<br>
electromotive force is generated in the secondary side winding<br>
218b. The electromotive force is given to the side electrode<br>
216c of the arc tube 216, and the xenon gas sealed in the arc<br>
tube 216 is excited. The electric power stored in the main<br>
capacitor 213 is discharged through the discharge loop of the<br>
( + ) side of the main capacitor 213, the choke coil 221, the anode<br>
216a, the cathode 216b and the (-) side of the main capacitor<br>
213 so that a flashlight is generated from the arc tube 216.<br>
Here, since the choke coil 221 is provided in the discharge loop,<br>
a peak value of the electric current flowing in the arc tube<br>
216 is suppressed. Therefore, the light emission curve becomes<br>
gentle, and the color temperature of the flashlight is lowered,<br>
and the light emission color is closer to a natural color where<br>
the blue component is less.<br>
Next, an emitted light amount is integrated in an exposure<br>
adjusting circuit (not sown) of the automatically adjusted<br>
flashlight generating apparatus, and at the time of reaching<br>
a predetermined light amount, a pulse signal of H level is input<br>
into the control terminal 224 so that the thyristor 222 is turned<br>
on. Here, an impedance of the thyristor 222 in the on state<br>
is smaller than an impedance of the arc tube 216 in the exciting<br><br>
state (for example, 1/10). Therefore, the electric power<br>
*<br>
stored in the main capacitor 213 bypasses the (+) side of the<br>
main capacitor 213, the choke coil 221, thyristor 222 and the<br>
(-) side of the main capacitor 213 so that the light emission<br>
is stopped. Here, since a peak value of the electric current<br>
flowing in the thyristor 222 is suppressed by the choke coil<br>
221, the thyristor 222 can be composed of an element whose<br>
allowable current is comparatively small. In such a manner,<br>
a light amount is controlled accurately even in a near distance.<br>
Fig. 17 is a diagram of a conventional flashlight<br>
generating circuit which is constituted so that a choke coil<br>
and a thyristor are connected to both ends of a main capacitor<br>
in series.<br>
In a flashlight generating circuit 230 shown in Fig. 17,<br>
the choke coil 221 and the thyristor 222 are connected to both<br>
the ends of the main capacitor 213 in series.<br>
When the trigger switch 219 is closed, the electric power<br>
stored in the trigger-use capacitor 217 is discharged, and an<br>
electric current flows in the primary side winding 218a and an<br>
electromotive force is generated in the second side winding 218b.<br>
This electromotive force is given to the side electrode 216c<br>
of the arc tube 218, and a xenon gas sealed in the arc tube 216<br>
is excited. An electric power stored in the main capacitor 213<br>
is discharged through the discharge loop of the ( + ) side of the<br>
main capacitor 213, the anode 216a, the cathode 216b and the<br>
(-) side of the main capacitor 213 so that a flashlight is<br>
generated from the arc tube 216.<br><br>
Next, a light emission amount is integrated by an exposure adjusting circuit (not<br>
shown) of the automatically adjusted flashlight generating apparatus, and at the time of<br>
reaching a predetermined light amount, a pulse signal of 'H' level is input into the control<br>
terminal 224 so that the thyristor 222 is turned on. The electric power stored in the main<br>
capacitor 213 bypasses the (+) side of the main capacitor 213, the choke coil 221, the<br>
thyristor 222 and the (-) side of the main capacitor 213 so that the light emission is stopped.<br>
In such a manner, an electric current having a large peak value is prevented from flowing in<br>
the thyristor 222 by the choke coil 221.<br>
However, in the above-mentioned flashlight generating circuit 220 and 230, since<br>
the choke coil 221 is added so as to suppress the peak value of the electric current flowing<br>
in the arc tube 216 and the thyristor 222, there arises problems that the cost rises and an area<br>
of a substrate circuit is large.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is devised in order to solve the above problems, and it is an<br>
object of the present invention to provide a flashlight generating circuit in which a cost and<br>
an area of a substrate circuit are reduced.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a flashlight generating circuit,<br>
comprising : a step-up circuit; a main capacitor for storing an electric power which is<br>
stepped up by said step-up circuit; an arc tube for generating a light by means of the electric<br>
power discharged from said main capacitor; and a trigger circuit which is provided with a<br>
trigger-use capacitor and a trigger coil in which a primary side winding is connected to said<br>
trigger-use capacitor and an electric power flowing in said trigger-use capacitor is<br><br>
transmitted to a secondary side winding so that a trigger voltage is applied to said arc tube,<br>
wherein the primary side winding of said trigger coil as well as said arc tube are arranged in<br>
a discharge loop where the electric power discharged from said main capacitor flows.<br>
In the flashlight generating circuit of the present invention, the primary side winding<br>
of the trigger coil as well as the arc tube is arranged in the discharge loop where the electric<br>
power discharged from the main capacitor flows. For this reason, time from starting the<br>
discharge in the arc tube and until a peak value of a light emission amount becomes<br>
maximum is delayed, and the peak value of the light emission amount becomes<br>
comparatively small and a light emission duration is kept longer so that a comparatively<br>
gentle light emission curve is obtained. Therefore, it is not necessary to add a choke coil in<br>
the discharge loop in order to obtain a gentle light emission curve unlike the conventional<br>
technique. As a result, the cost and an area of a substrate circuit are reduced.<br>
Here, the primary side winding of the trigger coil may be arranged on an anode side<br>
of the arc tube, or the primary side winding of the trigger coil may be arranged on a cathode<br>
side of the arc tube.<br>
In such a manner, when the primary side winding of the<br><br>
trigger coil is arranged on the anode side or on the cathode<br>
side of the arc tube, a degree of freedom of the circuit design<br>
is heightened.<br>
Further, the flashlight generating circuit of the present<br>
invention is provided with a non-contact switch in the discharge<br>
loop.<br>
In the case where the non-contact switch is provided in<br>
the discharge loop, the non-contact switch is turned on at the<br>
light emission starting timing so that a flashlight is generated<br>
from the arc tube. At the time of reaching a predetermined<br>
amount of light, the non-contact switch is turned off so that<br>
the flashlight is stopped. AS a result, an automatically<br>
adjusted light control can be made in an automatically adjusted<br>
flashlight generating apparatus.<br>
In the case where the non-contact switch is provided, it<br>
is preferable to provide a by-pass-use diode for allowing an<br>
electric current caused by a back electromotive force generated<br>
in the primary side winding of the trigger coil to bypass when<br>
the non-contact switch is changed from an on-state into an<br>
off-state.<br>
When the non-contact switch with good performance which<br>
is instantaneously changed from the on-state into the off-state<br>
is used, light adjusting performance is improved, but a great<br>
back electromotive force is generated in the primary side<br>
winding of the trigger coil. When the by-pass-use diode is<br>
provided, the generated back electromotive force is applied<br>
directly to the non-contact switch so that the non-contact<br><br>
switch is prevented from being destroyed.<br>
In addition, the trigger-use capacitor may apply a<br>
voltage with polarity for helping a flow of the electric force<br>
discharged from the main capacitor to between the anode and the<br>
cathode of the arc tube at timing that a trigger voltage is<br>
applied to the arc tube.<br>
In another way, a voltage application-use capacitor for<br>
applying a voltage with polarity, for helping a flow of the<br>
electric force discharged from the main capacitor to between<br>
the anode and the cathode of the arc tube at timing that a trigger<br>
voltage is applied to the arc tube, may be provided besides the<br>
trigger-use capacitor.<br>
In the case where the voltage application-use capacitor<br>
is provided, it is preferable that the voltage application-<br>
use capacitor applies a voltage at the time when the main<br>
capacitor and the voltage application-use capacitor are<br>
connected in series to between the anode and the cathode of the<br>
arc tube at the timing that the trigger voltage is applied to<br>
the arc tube in cooperation with the main capacitor.<br>
When the voltage with polarity is applied to between the<br>
anode and the cathode of the arc tube at the timing that a trigger<br>
voltage is applied to the arc tube, a light is easily generated<br>
from the arc tube when a trigger voltage is applied to the arc<br>
tube. As a result, a capacitance of the trigger-use capacitor<br>
is lowered, or the trigger voltage can be lowered.<br>
Further, the trigger-use capacitor may be kept in a<br>
discharged state before the timing that a trigger voltage is<br><br>
applied to the arc tube, and may apply a trigger voltage to the<br>
arc tube via the trigger coil after the electric power<br>
discharged from the main capacitor passes therethrough.<br>
In addition, it is preferable that the primary side<br>
winding of the trigger coil and the main capacitor are arranged<br>
in series.<br>
Since the primary side winding of the trigger coil and<br>
the main capacitor are arranged in series, the primary side<br>
winding serves as a choke coil for suppressing a peak value of<br>
the electric current flowing in the arc tube. As a result, a<br>
gentle light emission curve can be obtained.<br>
Further, the flashlight generating circuit of the present<br>
invention may be provided with a by-pass circuit for bypassing<br>
an electric current which is supplied from the main capacitor<br>
and flows via the arc tube during the flowing of the electric<br>
current in the arc tube so as to stop the electric current flowing<br>
in the arc tube.<br>
When such a by-pass circuit is provided, the flashlight<br>
from the arc tube can be stopped during the emission . Therefore,<br>
a light amount can be controlled.<br>
In addition, the by-pass circuit may have: a resistance<br>
arranged in series with the arc tube; and a switch element which<br>
is arranged parallel with the arc tube between a connection node,<br>
arranged between the resistance and one terminal of the arc tube,<br>
and the other terminal of the arc tube.<br>
Since the by-pass circuit has the resistance and the<br>
switch element arranged in such a manner, when a flashlight is<br><br>
generated from the arc tube, both the primary side winding and<br>
the resistance suppress a peak value of the electric current<br>
flowing in the arc tube. As a result, a gentler light emission<br>
curve is obtained, and when the flashlight from the arc tube<br>
is stopped during the emission, a peak value of the electric<br>
current flowing in the switch element can be suppressed.<br>
Further, the by-pass circuit may have a resistance and<br>
a switch element for controlling on/off state of by-pass which<br>
are arranged in series.<br>
Since the by-pass circuit has the resistance and the<br>
switch element arranged in series, when a flashlight which is<br>
generated from the arc tube is stopped, both the primary side<br>
winding and the resistance can suppress a peak value of the<br>
electric current flowing in the switch element.<br>
In addition, a light adjusting circuit, for detecting<br>
timing that a predetermined amount of a light is emitted from<br>
the arc tube according to the electric current flowing in the<br>
arc tube and instructing the by-pass circuit to bypass the<br>
electric current, may be provided.<br>
When such a light adjusting circuit is provided, the<br>
flashlight from the arc tube can be stopped at the timing that<br>
a predetermined amount of light is emitted from the arc tube.<br>
For this reason, an automatically adjusting flashlight<br>
generating apparatus can be realized.<br>
Further, the by-pass circuit may be detachably connected<br>
parallel with the arc tube.<br>
With this structure, when a normal flash apparatus which<br><br>
does not stop a flashlight during emission, and an automatically<br>
adjusted flashlight generating apparatus (auto-flash<br>
apparatus) for controlling a flashlight so that its emission<br>
is stopped at the time of reaching a predetermined light amount,<br>
are manufactured, the flashlight generating circuit to which<br>
the arc tube is mounted and the by-pass circuit can be<br>
manufactured individually. As a result, circuit parts are<br>
commonly used so that the manufacturing process is simplified<br>
and the troublesome of product management is reduced. Moreover,<br>
when an adaptor into which a circuit substrate is incorporated<br>
is attached to a housing of a normal flash apparatus, an<br>
auto-flash apparatus can be realized easily.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
There will be described below preferred embodiments of<br>
the present invention. Here, a flashlight generating circuit<br>
which is mounted to a camera will be explained.<br>
Fig. 1 is a diagram showing a flashlight generating<br>
circuit according to a first embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
A flashlight generating circuit 10 shown in Fig. 1 is<br>
provided with a step-up circuit 11 which is connected to an <br>
internal battery 1 for controlling the whole camera. This<br>
step-up circuit 11 steps up a voltage from the internal battery<br>
1 to a predetermined voltage.<br>
In addition, the flashlight generating circuit 10 is<br>
provided with a main capacitor 13 for storing an electric power <br><br>
which is stepped up by the step-up circuit 11 via a diode 12.<br>
A resistance element 14 and a trigger switch 15 are connected <br>
to both ends of the main capacitor 13 in series.<br>
Further, the flashlight generating circuit 10 is provided<br>
with a trigger circuit 16 having an arc tube 16_1, a trigger-use <br>
capacitor 16_2 and a trigger coil, 16_3.	<br>
The arc tube 16_1 has an anode 16_la, a cathode 16_lb and<br>
a side electrode 16_lc, and a xenon (XE) gas is sealed in the<br>
arc tube 16_1. This arc tube 16_1 emits a light by means of<br>
the electric power discharged from the main capacitor 13.<br>
Moreover, the trigger coil 16_3 is composed of a primary side<br>
winding 16_3a having a predetermined winding number and a <br>
secondary side winding 16_3b having a winding number larger than<br>
that of the primary side winding 16_3a. One end of the primary<br>
side winding 16_3a is connected to the cathode 16_la of the arc<br>
tube 16_1. The one end of the primary side winding 16_3a is<br>
connected, also to a connection point between the resistance <br>
element 14 and the trigger switch 15 via the trigger-use <br>
capacitor 16_2. Meanwhile, one end of the secondary side<br>
winding 16_3b is connected to the side electrode 16_lc of the<br>
arc tube 16_1. The other end of the primary side winding 16_3a<br>
and the other end of the secondary side winding 16_3b are<br>
connected commonly to a (+) side of the main capacitor 13.<br>
The trigger coil 16_3 transmits an electric power flowing<br>
in the trigger-use capacitor 16_2 to the secondary side winding<br>
16_3b so as to apply a trigger voltage to the arc tube 16_1.<br>
The primary side winding 16_3a of the trigger coil 16_3 as well<br><br>
as the arc tube 16_1 is arranged in a discharge loop LI where<br>
the electric power discharged from the main capacitor 13 flows.<br>
In the flashlight generating circuit 10 having such a<br>
structure, at first an electric power from the internal battery <br>
1 is stepped up by the step-up circuit 11 in a state that the<br>
trigger switch 15 is opened. The stepped-up electric power is<br>
stored in the main capacitor 13 via the diode 12. Moreover,<br>
the stepped-up electric power is stored also in the trigger-use<br>
capacitor 16_2 through the primary side winding 16_3a, the<br>
trigger-use capacitor 16_2, the resistance element 14 and the<br>
diode 12.<br>
Next, the trigger switch 15 is closed in synchronization<br>
with an action of a shutter of the camera at the time of<br>
photography. The voltage of the main capacitor 13 is applied<br>
to one end of the trigger-use capacitor 16_2 via the trigger<br>
switch 15, as a result, a positive voltage which is higher than<br>
the applied voltage by a voltage of the trigger-use capacitor<br>
16_2 is output from the other end of the trigger-use capacitor<br>
16_2. This positive voltage is applied to the anode 16_la of<br>
the arc tube 16_1 and the primary side winding 16_3a. As a<br>
result, the electric power stored in the trigger-use capacitor<br>
16_2 is discharged, and an electric current flows in the primary<br>
side winding 16_3a so that an electromotive force is caused in<br>
the secondary side winding 16_3b. Here, since a winding number<br>
of the secondary side winding 16_3b is larger than a winding<br>
number of the primary side winding 16_3a, the electromotive<br>
force caused in the second side winding 16_3b is amplified to<br><br>
be strong. Since such a strong electromotive force is applied<br>
as a trigger voltage to the side electrode 16_lc of the arc tube<br>
16_1, the xenon gas sealed in the arc tube 16_1 is excited. The<br>
electric power stored in the main capacitor 13 is discharged<br>
via the discharge loop LI of the ( + ) side of the main capacitor<br>
13, the primary side winding 16_3a, the anode 16_la, the cathode<br>
16_lb and the (-) side of the main capacitor 13 so that a<br>
flashlight is generated from the arc tube 16_1. In such a manner,<br>
the flashlight is emitted.<br>
In the flashlight generating circuit 10 of the present<br>
embodiment, as mentioned above, the trigger-use capacitor 16_2<br>
applies the positive voltage to the anode 16_la of the arc tube<br>
16_1 and a negative voltage to the cathode 16_lb at timing that<br>
the trigger voltage is applied to the arc tube 16_1 at the time<br>
when the trigger switch 15 is closed, namely, applies voltages<br>
with polarity for helping the flow of the electric power<br>
discharged from the main capacitance 13. Therefore, this<br>
voltage coupled with the trigger voltage applied to the arc tube<br>
16_1 makes light emission from the arc tube 16_1 more easy.<br>
Fig. 2 is a diagram showing a light emission }<br>
characteristic of the flashlight generating circuit 10 shown w<br>
in Fig. 1 and a light emission characteristic of the<br>
conventional flashlight generating circuit 200 shown in Fig.<br>
14.<br>
A curved line A show in Fig. 2 is a light emission curve<br>
showing the light emission characteristic of the flashlight<br>
generating circuit 200 from the time when the light emission<br><br>
is started to the time when the light emission is ended.<br>
Meanwhile, a curved line B is a light emission curve showing<br>
the light emission characteristic of the flashlight generating<br>
circuit 10 of the present embodiment from the time when the light<br>
emission is started to the time when the light emission is ended.<br>
There is no great difference between an integral value of a light<br>
emission amount represented by the curved line A and an integral<br>
value of a light emission amount represented by the curved line<br>
B.<br>
In the conventional flashlight generating circuit. 200,<br>
as described with reference to Fig. 14, since only the arc tube<br>
is arranged in the discharge loop, a discharge is started<br>
instantaneously in the arc tube, and the light emission takes<br>
the abrupt light emission curve represented by the curved line<br>
A so as to be ended. In the light emission represented by the<br>
abrupt light emission curve, it is generally difficult to<br>
control an exposure by means of the flashlight accurately in<br>
a near distance. Moreover, since the color temperature of the<br>
flashlight is high and a light having great blue component is<br>
emitted, it is necessary to arrange, for example, a protector<br>
formed by coloring a resin material before a light emission<br>
section.<br>
Meanwhile, in the flashlight generating circuit 10 of the<br>
present embodiment, the primary side winding 16_3a of the<br>
trigger coil 16_3 as well as the arc tube 16_1 is arranged in<br>
the discharge loop LI where the electric power discharged from<br>
the main capacitor 13 flows. For this reason, as represented<br><br>
by the curved line B in Fig. 2, time from starting the discharge<br>
in the arc tube 16_1 and until a peak value of a light emission<br>
amount becomes maximum is delayed, and the peak value of the<br>
light emission amount becomes comparatively small and a gentle<br>
light emission curve is obtained so that a light emission<br>
duration is kept longer.<br>
In addition, a value of the electric current flowing in<br>
the arc tube 16_1 of the flashlight generating circuit 10 is<br>
smaller than a value of the electric current flowing in the arc<br>
tube of the conventional flashlight generating circuit-200.<br>
For this reason, although a light amount of the flashlight is<br>
being maintained, the color temperature of the flashlight is I !<br>
lowered, and the light emission color is closer to a natural<br>
color with less blue component. As a result, a light with good<br>
photographic congeniality can be obtained. Further, since the<br>
value of the electric current flowing in the arc tube 16_1 is 1 <br>
small, the life of the arc tube 16_1 is lengthened.<br>
In addition, when the present invention is compared with<br>
the conventional technique that a choke coil is added into a<br>
discharge loop in order to obtain a gentle light emission curve,<br>
the cost and an area of a substrate circuit are reduced.<br>
Fig. 3 is a diagram showing a flashlight generating<br>
circuit according to a second embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Here, the same reference numerals are given to the<br>
components which are the same as those of the flashlight<br>
generating circuit 10 shown in Fig. 1, and characteristic<br><br>
portion will be explained.<br>
A flashlight generating circuit 20 of the present<br>
embodiment is maintained in a state of discharge before the<br>
timing that the trigger-use capacitor 16_2 applies a trigger<br>
voltage to the arc tube 16_1, and when an electric power<br>
discharged from the main capacitor 13 is allowed to pass, the<br>
trigger voltage is applied to the arc tube 16_1 via the trigger<br>
coil 16_3.<br>
The trigger-use capacitor 162 and the trigger switch 15<br>
are connected in series between the anode 16_la and the cathode<br>
16_lb of the arc tube 16_1 composing the flashlight generating<br>
circuit 20 shown in Fig. 3 in an order from the anode 16_la side.<br>
Moreover, the resistance element 14 is connected to the<br>
trigger-use capacitor 16_2 parallel.<br>
At the first time when the power source of the camera is<br>
turned on, the trigger switch 15 is opened, and after the power<br>
source is turned on, the main capacitor 13 is charged.<br>
Meanwhile, the trigger-use capacitor 16_2 is kept in the state<br>
of discharge.<br>
Next, the trigger switch 15 is closed in synchronization<br>
with the action of the shutter of the camera at the time of<br>
photography. An electric current flows through the path of the<br>
( + ) side of the main capacitor 13, the primary side winding 16_3a,<br>
the trigger-use capacitor 16__2, the trigger switch 15 and the<br>
(-) side of the main capacitor 13. Since the electric current<br>
flows in the primary side winding 163a, the trigger voltage<br>
is applied from the secondary side winding 16_3b to the side<br><br>
electrode 16_lc. The electric power stored in the main<br>
capacitor 13 is discharged through a discharge loop L2 of the<br>
( + ) side of the main capacitor 13 , the primary side winding 16_3a,<br>
the anode 16_la, the cathode 16_lb and the (-) side of the main<br>
capacitor 13. As a result, the flashlight is generated from<br>
the arc tube 16_1. When the electric power discharged from the<br>
main capacitor 13 is allowed to pass at the time when the trigger<br>
switch 15 is closed in such a manner, the electric current is<br>
allowed to flow in the primary side winding 16_3a so that the<br>
trigger voltage is obtained. The light may be emitted from the<br>
arc tube 16_1 by this trigger voltage. <br>
Fig. 4 is a diagram showing a flashlight generating<br>
circuit according to a third embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
In the flashlight generating circuit 10 shown in Fig. 1,<br>
the primary side winding 16_3a of the trigger coil 16_3 is<br>
arranged^pn the anode 16_la side of the arc tube 16_1, but in<br>
the flashlight generating circuit 30 shown in Fig. 4, the<br>
primary side winding 16_3a of the trigger coil 16_3 is arranged<br>
on the cathode 16_lb side of the arc tube 16_1. Moreover, a<br>
non-contact switch 17 is arranged between the primary side<br>
winding 16_3a and the main capacitor 13 in the discharge loop<br>
L3. The non-contact switch 17 has a control terminal 18 for<br>
controlling on/off state of the non-contact switch 17.<br>
Moreover, the resistance element 14 and the trigger-use<br>
capacitor 16_2 are connected in series to both the ends of the<br>
main capacitor 13. The contact point between the resistance<br><br>
element 14 and the trigger-use capacitor 16_2 is connected to<br>
the cathode 16_lb and the primary side winding 16_3a via the<br>
diode 16_4.<br>
In the flashlight generating circuit 30 of the present<br>
embodiment, at the first time when the power source of the camera <br><br>
is turned on, a control signal of 'L' level is input into the<br>
control terminal 18, and the non-contact switch 17 is in the<br>
off state. Moreover, an electric power is stored in both the<br>
main capacitor 13 and the trigger-use capacitor 16_2.<br>
Here, a control signal of 'H' level is input into the<br>
control terminal 18 in synchronization with the action of the<br>
shutter of the camera at the time of photography. The non-<br>
contact switch 17 is turned on, and the electric power stored<br>
in the trigger-use capacitor 16_2 is discharged via the diode<br>
16_4, the primary side winding 16_3a and the non-contact switch<br>
17 . As a result, the electric current flows in the primary side<br>
winding _1.6_3 a, and the trigger voltage is applied from the<br>
secondary side winding 16_3b to the side electrode 16_lc. The<br>
electric power stored in the main capacitor 13 is discharged<br>
through the discharge loop L3 of the ( + ) side of the main<br>
capacitor 13, the anode 16_la, the cathode 16_lb, the primary<br>
side winding 16_3a, the non-contact switch 17 and the (-) side<br>
of the main capacitor 13 . As a result, a flashlight is generated<br>
from the arc tube 16_1. Thereafter, a light emission amount<br>
is integrated in an exposure adjusting circuit (not shown) of<br>
the automatically adjusted flashlight generating apparatus,<br>
and at the time of reaching a predetermined light amount, the<br><br>
control signal is changed into 'L' level and the non-contact<br>
switch 17 is turned off so that the light emission is stopped.<br>
In such a manner, the non-contact switch 17 is arranged in the<br>
discharge loop L3 and the non-contact switch 17 is controlled<br>
so that the light amount can be controlled accurately in a near<br>
distance.<br>
Fig. 5 is a diagram showing a flashlight generating<br>
circuit according to a fourth embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
In a flashlight generating circuit 40 shown in Fig. 5,<br>
the non-contact switch 17 is arranged in a discharge loop L4.<br>
Moreover, the trigger-use capacitor 16_2 composing the<br>
flashlight generating circuit 40 is maintained in a discharged<br>
state before the timing that a trigger voltage is applied to<br>
the arc tube 16_1, and when an electric power discharged from<br>
the main capacitor 1 is allowed to pass, the trigger voltage<br>
is applied to the arc tube 16_1 via the trigger coil 16_3.<br>
The diode 16_4 and the trigger switch 15 are connected<br>
in series to between the anode 16_la and the cathode 16_lb of<br>
the arc tube 16_1 in an order from the anode 16_la side . Moreover,<br>
the resistance element 14 is connected to the trigger switch<br>
15 parallel. Further, the non-contact switch 17 is arranged<br>
between the cathode 16_lb and the main capacitor 13.<br>
At the first time when the power source of the camera is<br>
turned on, a control signal of ' L' level is input into the control<br>
terminal 18, and the non-contact switch 17 is in the off state.<br>
The main capacitor 13 is charged, and the trigger-use capacitor<br><br>
16_2 is kept in the discharged state.<br>
Here, a control signal of 'H' level is input into the<br>
control terminal 18 in synchronization with the action of the<br>
shutter of the camera at the time of photography. The non-<br>
contact switch 17 is turned on, and the electric power stored<br>
in the main capacitor 13 is discharged via the primary side<br>
winding 16_3a, the diode 16_4, the trigger-use capacitor 16_2<br>
and the non-contact switch 17 . As a result, an electric current<br>
flows in the primary side winding 16_3a, and a trigger voltage<br>
is applied from the secondary side winding 16_3b to the-side<br>
electrode 16_lc. The electric power stored in the main<br>
capacitor 13 is discharged through the discharge loop L4 of the<br>
( + ) side of the main capacitor 13 , the primary side winding 16_3a,<br>
the anode 16_la, the cathode 16_lb the non-contact switch 17<br>
and the (-) side of the main capacitor 13. As a result, a<br>
flashlight is generated from the arc tube 16_1. Thereafter,<br>
at the time of reaching a predetermined light amount, the<br>
control signal is changed into 'L' level and the non-contact<br>
switch 17 is turned off so that the light emission is stopped.<br>
With this structure, the light amount may be controlled<br>
accurately.<br>
Fig. 6 is a diagram showing a flashlight generating<br>
circuit according to a fifth embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
In a flashlight generating circuit 50 shown in Fig. 6,<br>
the non-contact switch 17 is arranged in a discharge loop L5.<br>
Moreover, the trigger-use capacitor 16_2 composing this<br><br>
flashlight generating circuit 50 applies a voltage with<br>
polarity for helping the flow of an electric power discharged<br>
from the main capacitor 13 to between the anode 16_la and the<br>
cathode 16_lb of the arc tube 16_1 at timing that a trigger<br>
voltage is applied to the arc tube 16_1.<br>
In the flashlight generating circuit 50, at the first time<br>
a control signal of ' L' level is input into the control terminal<br>
18, and the non-contact switch 17 is in the off state. An<br>
electric power is stored in the main capacitor 13 via the diode<br>
12. Moreover, the electric power is stored also in the<br>
trigger-use capacitor 16_2 via the diode 12, the resistance<br>
element 14, the trigger-use capacitor 16_2, the primary side<br>
winding 16_3a and the resistance element 16_6.<br>
Here, a control signal of "H" level is input into the<br>
control terminal 18 in synchronization with the action of the<br>
shutter of the camera at photography. The non-contact switch<br>
17 is turned on, and an electric potential of one end (on the<br>
side of the non-contact switch 17) of the trigger-use capacitor<br>
16_2 drops abruptly to a potential on the (-) side of the main<br>
capacitor 13. As a result, a negative voltage, which is lower<br>
than a voltage of the (-) side of the main capacitor 13 by a<br>
voltage of the trigger-use capacitor 16_2, is output from the<br>
other end of the trigger-use capacitor 16_2. This negative<br>
voltage is applied to the cathode 16_lb, and the electric power<br>
stored in the trigger-use capacitor 16_2 is discharged through<br>
the non-contact switch 17, the diode 16_5 and the primary side<br>
winding 16_3a. As a result, an electric current flows in the<br><br>
primary side winding 16_3a, and a trigger voltage is applied<br>
from the secondary side winding 163b to the side electrode 16_lc.<br>
The electric power stored in the main capacitor 13 is discharged<br>
through the discharge loop L5 which passes through the anode<br>
16_la, the cathode 16_lb, the primary side winding 16_3a, the<br>
diode 16_4 and the non-contact switch 17. As a result, a<br>
flashlight is generated form the arc tube 16_1. In such a manner,<br>
at the timing that the trigger voltage is applied to the arc<br>
tube 16_1 at the time when the non-contact switch 17 is turned<br>
on, a positive voltage is applied to the anode 16_la and the<br>
negative voltage is applied to the cathode 16_lb, namely, the<br>
voltages with polarities for helping the flow of the electric<br>
power discharged from the main capacitor 13 are applied to<br>
between the anode 16_la and the cathode 16_lb of the arc tube<br>
16_1. This voltage coupled with the trigger voltage applied<br>
to the arc tube 16_1 makes the light emission from the arc tube<br>
16_1 easj-.er.<br>
Next, at the time of reaching a predetermined light amount,<br>
the control signal is changed into 'L1 level and the non-contact<br>
switch 17 is turned off so that the light emission is stopped.<br>
With this structure, the light amount may be controlled<br>
accurately.<br>
Fig. 7 is a diagram showing a flashlight generating<br>
circuit according to a sixth embodiment of the present invention.<br>
In the flashlight generating circuit shown in Fig. 7, the arc<br>
tube 16_1, the primary side winding 16_3a of the trigger coil<br>
16_3 and the non-contact switch 17 are arranged in series in<br><br>
a discharge loop L6 in an order from the (+) side of the main<br>
capacitor 13. Moreover, the resistance element 14 and the<br>
trigger-use capacitor 16_2 are connected in series between the<br>
( + ) side and the (-) side of the main capacitor 13 in an order<br>
from the ( + ) side. The connection point between the resistance<br>
element 14 and the trigger-use capacitor 16_2 is directly<br>
connected to the connection point between the arc tube 16_1 and<br>
the primary side winding 16_3a. Further, a by-pass-use diode<br>
16-7 is connected to between the connection point between the<br>
trigger coil 16_3 and the non-contact switch 17 and the (+) side<br>
of the main capacitor 13, namely, an anode of the by-pass-use<br>
diode 16_7 is connected to the side of the non-contact switch<br>
17 and a cathode is connected to the side of the main capacitor<br>
13.<br>
In this flashlight generating circuit 60, at the first<br>
time when the power source of the camera is turned on, a control<br>
signal of 'L' level is input into the control terminal 18, and<br>
the non-contact switch 17 is in the off state. Moreover, an<br>
electric power is stored in both the main capacitor 13 and the<br>
trigger-use capacitor 16_2.<br>
Here, a control signal of 'H' level is input into the<br>
control terminal 18 in synchronization with the action of the<br>
shutter of the camera at the time of photography. The non-<br>
contact switch 17 is turned on, and the electric power stored<br>
in the trigger-use capacitor 162 is discharged via the primary<br>
side winding 16_3a and the non-contact switch 17. As a result,<br>
an electric current flows in the primary side winding 16_3a,<br><br>
and a trigger voltage is applied from the secondary side winding<br>
16_3b to the side electrode 16_lc. The electric power stored<br>
in the main capacitor 13 is discharged via the discharge loop<br>
L6 which passes through the ( + ) side of the main capacitor 13,<br>
the anode 16_la, the cathode 16_lb, the primary side winding<br>
16_3a, the non-contact switch 17 and the (-) side of the main<br>
capacitor 13. As a result, a flashlight is discharged from the<br>
arc tube 16_1. Next, a light emission amount is integrated in<br>
the exposure adjusting circuit (not shown) in the automatically<br>
adjusted flashlight generating apparatus, and at the time of<br>
reaching a predetermined light amount, the control signal is<br>
changed into 'L' level. The non-contact switch 17 is turned<br>
off so that the light emission is stopped.<br>
When the non-contact switch 17 is turned off, the electric<br>
current, which flows in the primary side winding 16_3a just<br>
before the turning-off, is abruptly cut off, and a strong back,<br>
electrom&amp;tive force is generated in the primary side winding<br>
16_3a. When this back electromotive force is applied directly<br>
to the non-contact switch 17, there is a possibility that the<br>
non-contact switch 17 is destroyed. However, in the case of<br>
the flashlight generating circuit of the sixth embodiment shown<br>
in Fig. 7, since the by-pass-use diode 16_7 is provided, an<br>
electric which is caused by the back electromotive force<br>
generated in the trigger coil 16_3 flows via the by-pass-use<br>
diode 16_7. As a result, a large voltage which is caused by<br>
the back electromotive force is prevented from being applied .'<br>
to the non-contact switch 17, and the non-contact switch 17 is<br><br>
prevented from being destroyed.<br>
Here, when the flashlight generating circuit 30 of the<br>
third embodiment shown in Fig. 4 is compared with the flashlight<br>
generating circuit 60 of the sixth embodiment shown in Fig. 7,<br>
there exist two differences.<br>
One is that the by-pass-use diode 16_7 which is provided<br>
in the flashlight generating circuit 60 is not provided in the<br>
flashlight generating circuit 30 shown in Fig. 4.<br>
This is because there exists a difference that the<br>
by-pass-use diode 16_7 should be provided according to strength<br>
of the electric current flowing in the arc tube 16_1, a withstand<br>
voltage of the non-contact switch 17 or a speed that the<br>
non-contact switch 17 is changed from the on-state to the<br>
off-state, or even if such a by-pass-use diode is not provided,<br>
the non-contact switch 17 is not destroyed. In the case of a<br>
design that a comparatively great electric current flows in the<br>
arc tube_^16_l or in the case the withstand voltage of the<br>
non-contact switch 17 is comparatively low or in the case where<br>
a speed that the non-contact switch 17 is changed from the<br>
on-state to the off-state is comparatively high, the by-<br>
pass-use diode is required, and in the opposite case, the<br>
by-pass-use diode is not necessarily required.<br>
In addition, the other difference between the flashlight<br>
generating circuit 30 shown in Fig. 4 and the flashlight<br>
generating circuit 60 shown in Fig. 7 is that the diode 16_4<br>
is provided between the connection point between the resistance<br>
element 14 and the trigger-use capacitor 16_2 and the connection<br><br>
point between the arc tube 161 and the primary side winding<br>
16_3a in the flashlight generating circuit 30 shown in Fig. 4,<br>
and these connection points are directly connected to each other<br>
in the flashlight generating circuit 60 shown in Fig. 7.<br>
As mentioned above, the non-contact switch 17 is turned<br>
on and the electric power stored in the trigger-use capacitor<br>
16_2 is discharged so that the light emission is started.<br>
Therefore, after the starting of the light emission, the<br>
trigger-use capacitor 16_2 is empty at the timing that the<br>
non-contact switch 17 is changed from the on-state to the<br>
off-state.<br>
Here, when the non-contact switch 17 is changed from the<br>
on-state to the off-state, in the case of the flashlight<br>
generating circuit 30 shown in Fig. 4, the light emission is<br>
stopped at the changing timing. However, in the case of the<br>
flashlight generating circuit 60 shown in Fig. 7, the light<br>
emission is not exactly stopped at the changing timing, and the<br>
light emission is stopped after the trigger-use capacitor 16_2<br>
is charged. As a result, over exposure might occur. Therefore,<br>
in the case of the flashlight generating circuit to be used for<br>
macrophotography, for example, in which a slight delay of the<br>
stop of the light emission greatly contributes to the exposure,<br>
the diode 16_4 is preferably provided. On the contrary, in the<br>
case where the flashlight generating circuit is mounted to a<br>
camera which does not take a picture in a near distance, the<br>
diode 16_4 is eliminated so that the cost may be reduced.<br>
Fig. 8 is a diagram showing a flashlight generating<br><br>
circuit according to a seventh embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
In a flashlight generating circuit 70 shown in Fig. 8,<br>
the arc tube 16_1, the diode 16_4 , the primary side winding 16_3a<br>
of the trigger coil 16_3 and the non-contact switch 17 are<br>
arranged in series in a discharge loop L7 in an order from the<br>
(+) side of the main capacitor 13.<br>
In addition, the resistance element 14 is connected to<br>
between the ( + ) side of the main capacitor 13 and the connection<br>
point between the trigger coil 16_3 and the non-contact switch<br>
17. A voltage application-use capacitor 16_8 is connected to<br>
between the connection point between the arc tube 16_1 and the<br>
diode 16_4 and the connection point between the trigger coil<br>
16_3 and the non-contact switch 17. A resistance element 19<br>
is connected between the connection point between the arc tube<br>
16_1 and the diode 16_4 and the (-) side of the main capacitor<br>
13. The_trigger-use capacitor 162 is connected to between the<br>
connection point between the diode 16_4 and the primary side<br>
winding 16_3a and the (-) side of the main capacitor 13.<br>
In this flashlight generating circuit 70, at the first<br>
time when the power source of the camera is turned on, a control<br>
signal of 'L' level is input into the control terminal 18, and<br>
the non-contact switch 17 is in the off-state. In this state,<br>
an electric power is stored in the main capacitor 13, and the<br>
electric power is stored also in the voltage application-use<br>
capacitor 16_8 via the resistance element 14, the voltage<br>
application-use capacitor 16_8 and the resistance element 19.<br><br>
Further, the electric power is stored also in the trigger-use<br>
capacitor 16_2 via the resistance element 14, the primary side<br>
winding 16_3a and the trigger-use capacitor 16_2.<br>
Here, a control signal of 'H' level is input into the<br>
control terminal 18 in synchronization with the action of the<br>
shutter of the camera at the time of photography. The non-<br>
contact switch 17 is turned on, an electric potential of one<br>
end of the voltage application-use capacitor 16_8 (on the side<br>
of the non-contact switch 17 charged to ( + )) is dropped abruptly<br>
to an electric potential of the ( - ) side of the main capacitor<br>
13 . The other end of the voltage application-use capacitor 16_8<br>
(on the side of the arc tube 16_1) has a negative voltage which<br>
is lower than the voltage of the (-) side of the main capacitor<br>
13 by the voltage on both ends of the voltage application-use<br>
capacitor 16_8 . This negative voltage is applied to the cathode<br>
16_lb of the arc tube 16_1. Therefore, at this instance, a sum<br>
of the charging voltages of the main capacitor 13 and the voltage<br>
application-use capacitor 16_8, namely, a voltage which is<br>
twice as much as the charging voltage of the main capacitor is<br>
applied to between the anode 16_la and the cathode 16_lb of the<br>
arc tube 16_1.<br>
In addition, when the non-contact switch 17 is turned on,<br>
the electric power stored in the trigger-use capacitor 16_2 is<br>
discharged via the primary side winding 16_3a and the non-<br>
contact switch 17. As a result, the electric current flows in<br>
the primary side winding 16_3a, and a trigger voltage is applied<br>
from the secondary side winding 163b to the side electrode 16_lc .<br><br>
The electric power stored in the main capacitor 13 is discharged<br>
via the discharge loop L7 which passes through the anode 16_la,<br>
the cathode 16_lb, the diode 16_4 , the primary side winding 16_3a<br>
and the non-contact switch 17. As a result, a flashlight is<br>
generated form the arc tube 16_1.<br>
In such a manner, in the case of the flashlight generating<br>
circuit 70 shown in Fig. 8, the voltage, which is twice as much<br>
as the charging voltage of the main capacitor 13, is applied<br>
to between the anode 16_la and the cathode 16_lb of the arc tube<br>
16_1 by the action of the voltage application-use capacitor 16_8<br>
at the timing that the trigger voltage is applied to the arc<br>
tube 16_1. This voltage coupled with the trigger voltage<br>
applied to the arc tube 16_1 ensure the light emission.<br>
Thereafter, at the time of reaching a predetermined light<br>
amount, the control signal is changed into 'L' level, and the<br>
non-contact switch 17 is turned off so that the light emission<br>
is stopped. With this structure, a light amount may be<br>
controlled accurately.<br>
Fig. 9 is a diagram showing a flashlight generating<br>
circuit according to an eighth embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
In a flashlight generating circuit 80 shown in Fig. 9,<br>
the primary side winding 16_3a of the trigger coil 16_3 and the<br>
main capacitor 13 are arranged in series. The arc tube 16_1<br>
is arranged parallel with the primary side winding 16_3a and<br>
the main capacitor 13 arranged in series. The resistance<br>
element 14 and a trigger switch 81 are arranged in series on<br><br>
both ends of the arc tube 16_1. The trigger-use capacitor 16_2<br>
is arranged between the connection point between the resistance<br>
element 14 and the trigger switch 81 and the connection point<br>
between the main capacitor 13 and the primary side winding 16_3a.<br>
Moreover, the secondary side winding 16_3b of the trigger coil<br>
16_3 is connected to the side electrode 16_3c of the arc tube<br>
16_1.<br>
In the flashlight generating circuit 80 having such a<br>
structure, at first in a state that the trigger switch 81 is<br>
opened, an electric power from the internal battery 1 is stepped<br>
up by the step-up circuit 11. An electric power is stored in<br>
the main capacitor 13 via the diode 12, the main capacitor 13<br>
and the primary side winding 16_3a of the trigger coil 16_3.<br>
Moreover, the electric power is stored also in the trigger-<br>
use capacitor 16_2 via the diode 12, the resistance element 14,<br>
the trigger-use capacitor 16_2 and the primary side winding<br>
16_3a of the trigger coil 16_3.<br>
Next, the trigger switch 81 is closed in synchronization<br>
with the action of the shutter of the camera at the time of<br>
photography. The electric power stored in the trigger-use<br>
capacitor 16_2 is discharged, and an electric current flows in<br>
the primary side winding 16_3a so that an electromotive force<br>
is generated in the secondary side winding 16_3b. This<br>
electromotive force is applied to the side electrode 16_lc of<br>
the arc tube 16_1, and a xenon gas sealed in the arc tube 16_1<br>
is excited. The electric power stored in the main capacitor<br>
13 is discharged via a discharge loop L8 of the ( + ) side of the<br><br>
main capacitor 13, the anode 16_la, the cathode 16_lb, the<br>
primary side winding 16_3a and the ( - ) side of the main capacitor<br>
13. As a result, a flashlight is generated from the arc tube<br>
16_1.<br>
Here, since the primary side winding 16_3a of the trigger<br>
coil 16_3 and the main capacitor 13 are arranged in series, the<br>
primary side winding 16_3a serves as a choke coil for suppressing<br>
a peak value of the electric current flowing in the arc tube<br>
16_1. As a result, a gentle light emission curve can be<br>
obtained.<br>
Fig. 10 is a diagram showing a flashlight generating<br>
circuit according to a ninth embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
The flashlight generating circuit 90 shown in Fig. 10 is<br>
provided with a circuit substrate 91 to which the above-<br>
mentioned flashlight generating circuit 80 is mounted. This<br>
circuit substrate 91 has connection terminals 91_1 and 91_2.<br>
In addition, the flashlight generating circuit 90 is<br>
provided with a circuit substrate 92 having connection<br>
terminals 92_1 and 92_2. A by-pass circuit 90_1, which is<br>
composed of a thyristor 93 and a resistance element 94 connected<br>
to a gate of the thyristor 93, is mounted to the circuit substrate<br>
92. This by-pass circuit 90-1 bypasses an electric current,<br>
which is supplied from the main capacitor 13 and flows via the<br>
arc tube 16_1, during the flowing of the electric current in<br>
the arc tube 16_1 so as to stop the electric current flowing<br>
in the arc tube 16_1.<br><br>
Further, a light adjusting circuit 95, which detects<br>
timing that a light of a predetermined amount is emitted from<br>
the arc tube 16_1 by means of the electric current flowing in<br>
the arc tube 16_1 so as to instruct the by-pass circuit 90_1<br>
about the by-pass of the electric current, is mounted to the<br>
circuit substrate 92. This light adjusting circuit 95 is<br>
composed of a light receiving sensor 95_1, a capacitor 952,<br>
a switch element 95_3, an amplifier 95_4, a variable resistor<br>
95-5, a comparator 95_6 and a trigger pulse generator 95_7.<br>
The light receiving sensor 95_1 receives a flashlight<br>
from the arc tube 16_1. The capacitor 95_2 stores electric<br>
charges corresponding to an amount of the light received by the<br>
light receiving sensor 95_1. The switch element 95_3 is<br>
controlled into the on-state before a flashlight is generated<br>
from the arc tube 16_1 so as to discharge residual electric<br>
charges in the capacitor 95_2. On the contrary, the switch<br>
element JJ5_3 is controlled into the off-state at the time when<br>
the flashlight is generated so as to allow the capacitor 95_2<br>
to store electric charges. The amplifier 9 5_4 amplifies a<br>
voltage according to the electric charges of the capacitor 95_2.<br>
The variable resistor 9 5_5 sets a threshold value according to<br>
a film sensitivity, iris , desirable light and shade and the like.<br>
The comparator 9 5_6 inputs the voltage from the amplifier 95_4<br>
and the threshold value set in the variable resistor 95_5, and<br>
when the voltage from the amplifier 9 5_4 exceeds the threshold<br>
value, the comparator 95_6 outputs a signal of 'H' level. The<br>
trigger pulse generator 95_7 receives the signal of 'H' level<br><br>
from the comparator 95_6 and outputs a trigger pulse.<br>
Next, there will be explained below an operation of the<br>
flashlight generating circuit 90. Since the operation during<br>
the time when the trigger switch 81 is closed and the flashlight<br>
is generated from the arc tube 16_1 is the same as the operation<br>
in the above-mentioned flashlight generating circuit 80, the<br>
description thereof is omitted. When the flashlight is<br>
generated from the arc tube 16_1, the light receiving sensor<br>
95_1 receives the flashlight, and electric charges according<br>
to an amount of the received light are stored in the capacitor<br>
95_2. The amplifier 95_4 amplifies a voltage according to the<br>
electric charges. The amplified voltage is input into a<br>
positive phase ( + ) terminal of the voltage comparator 95_6 . The<br>
threshold value is input into an opposite phase (-) terminal<br>
of the comparator 95_6. The comparator 95_6 compares the<br>
voltage with the threshold value, and when the voltage from the<br>
amplifier.95_4 exceeds the threshold value, outputs a signal<br>
of 'H' level to the trigger pulse generator 95_7. As a result,<br>
a trigger pulse is output from the trigger pulse generator 95_7.<br>
The trigger pulse output from the trigger pulse generator<br>
95_7 is input into the gate of the thyristor 93. The thyristor<br>
93 is then in the on-state, and the electric power stored in<br>
the main capacitor 13 is bypassed successively via the ( + ) side<br>
of the main capacitor 13, the connection terminal 91_1, the<br>
connection terminal 921, the thyristor 93, the connection<br>
terminal 922, the connection terminal 91_2, the primary side<br>
winding 16_3a of the trigger coil 163 and the (-) side of the<br><br>
main capacitor 13. Since the electric current, which is<br>
supplied from the main capacitor 13 and flows via the arc tube<br>
16_1, flows in the by-pass circuit 90_1, the electric current<br>
flowing in the arc tube 16_1 is stopped so that the light emission<br>
is stopped. Here, since the primary side winding 16_3a of the<br>
trigger coil 16_3 serves as a choke coil, an electric current<br>
with a comparatively large peak value is prevented from flowing<br>
in the thyristor 93.	-<br>
In the flashlight generating circuit 90 of the present<br>
embodiment, since the primary side winding 16_3a of the trigger<br>
coil 16_3 and the main capacitor 13 are arranged in series, when<br>
the flashlight is generated from the arc tube 16_1, the primary<br>
side winding 16_3a suppresses the peak value of the electric<br>
current flowing in the arc tube 16_1. As a result, a gentler<br>
light emission curve can be obtained, and when a light amount<br>
is controlled, the peak value of the electric current flowing<br>
in the thyristor 93 can be suppressed. For this reason, the<br>
thyristor 93, which can withstand a comparatively small<br>
electric current and has a small dimension and is inexpensive,<br>
can be adopted. Moreover, since the light adjusting circuit<br>
95 is provided, the automatically adjusted flashlight<br>
generating apparatus, which controls a flashlight so that its<br>
emission is stopped at the time of reaching a predetermined<br>
light amount, can be realized.<br>
Further, in the flashlight generating circuit 90 of the<br>
present embodiment, the circuit substrate 92 to which the<br>
by-pass circuit 90_1 and the light adjusting circuit 95 are<br><br>
mounted is detachably connected to the circuit substrate 91 to<br>
which the arc tube 16_1 and the like is mounted. For this reason,<br>
when a camera, which is constituted by incorporating a normal<br>
flash apparatus which does not stop a flashlight during emission,<br>
and a camera, which is constituted by incorporating the<br>
automatically adjusted flashlight generating apparatus<br>
(auto-flash apparatus) for controlling a flashlight so that its<br>
emission is stopped at the time of reaching a predetermined<br>
light amount, are manufactured, the circuit substrate 91 and<br>
the circuit substrate 92 can be manufactured individually-. As<br>
a result, parts are commonly used so that the manufacturing<br>
process is simplified and the troublesome of product management<br>
is reduced. Moreover, a structure, that an adaptor into which<br>
the circuit substrate 92 is incorporated is attached to a<br>
housing of the camera into which the normal flash apparatus is<br>
incorporated, is adopted, a camera having an auto-flash<br>
apparatus^ can be realized easily.<br>
Here, the flashlight generating circuit 90 of the present<br>
embodiment was described in relation to the example that the<br>
thyristor 93 is controlled by a signal from the light adjusting<br>
circuit 95, but it is not limited to this example, and the<br>
thyristor 93 may be controlled by a signal according to guide<br>
number.<br>
Fig. 11 is a diagram showing a flashlight generating<br>
circuit according to a tenth embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
A flashlight generating circuit 100 show in Fig. 11 is+<br><br>
provided with a circuit substrate 101, to which a resistance<br>
element 102 arranged in series between the ( + ) side of the main<br>
capacitor 13 and the anode 16_la of the arc tube 16_1 is mounted.<br>
Moreover, the thyristor 93 is arranged between the connection<br>
point between the resistance element 102 and the anode 16_la<br>
of the arc tube 16_1 and the cathode 16_lb of the arc tube 16_1<br>
via connection terminals 101_1 and 9 2_1 and connection<br>
terminals 101_2 and 92_2. These resistance element 102 and the<br>
thyristor 93 correspond to the by-pass circuit of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Since the flashlight generating circuit 100 of the<br>
present embodiment has the resistance element 102 and the<br>
thyristor 93 arranged in such a manner, when a flashlight is<br>
generated from the arc tube 16_1, both the primary side winding<br>
16_3a and the resistance element 102 suppress a peak value of<br>
an electric current flowing in the arc tube 16_1 so that a gentler<br>
light emission curve is obtained. At the same time, when the<br>
flashlight from the arc tube 16_1 is stopped during the emission,<br>
both the primary side winding 16_3a and the resistance element<br>
102 suppress a peak value of an electric current flowing in the<br>
thyristor 93.<br>
Fig. 12 is a diagram showing a flashlight generating<br>
circuit according to an eleventh embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
A flashlight generating circuit 110 shown in Fig. 12 has<br>
a resistance element 111 and a thyristor 93 for controlling<br>
on/off state of a by-pass which are arranged in series between<br><br>
the anode 16_la and the cathode 16_lb of the arc tube 161 via<br>
the connection terminals 91_1 and 92_1 and the connection<br>
terminals 91_2 and 922. These resistance element 111 and the<br>
thyristor 93 correspond to the by-pass circuit of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Since the flashlight generating circuit 110 of the<br>
present embodiment has the resistance element 111 and the<br>
thyristor 93 which are arranged in series, when a flashlight<br>
from the arc tube 16_1 is stopped during emission, the primary<br>
side winding 16_3a and the resistance element 111 suppress a<br>
peak value of an electric current flowing in the thyristor 93.<br>
Fig. 13 is a diagram showing a flashlight generating<br>
circuit according to a twelfth embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
In a flashlight generating circuit 120 shown in Fig. 13,<br>
a series of pulse signals are input into an IGBT element 124<br>
so as to be pulse-generated, and a flashlight is generated form<br>
the arc tube 16_1. When this flashlight generating circuit 120<br>
is compared with the flashlight generating circuit 80 shown in<br>
Fig. 9, the trigger switch 81 is replaced by a thyristor 121.<br>
A gate of the thyristor 121 is connected to a resistance element<br>
122 and a control terminal 123. Moreover, the IGBT (Insulated<br>
Gate Bipolar Transistor) element 124, in which a collector is<br>
connected to the cathode 16_lb of the arc tube 16_1 and an emitter<br>
is connected to the ( - ) side of the main capacitor 13 via the<br>
primary side winding 163a of the trigger coil 163, is arranged<br>
in a discharge loop L9. A gate of the IGBT element 124 is<br><br>
connected to the control terminal 125.<br>
In the flashlight generating circuit 120 having such a<br>
structure, at the first time that a power source of a camera<br>
is turned on, a control signal of 'L' level is input into the<br>
control terminal 123, and the thyristor 121 is in the off state.<br>
Moreover, an electric power from the internal battery 1 is<br>
stepped-up by the step-up circuit 11, and an electric power is<br>
stored in the main capacitor 13b via the diode 12, the main<br>
capacitor 13 and the primary side winding 16_3a of the trigger<br>
coil 16_3. Further, an electric power is stored also.in a<br>
trigger-use capacitor 16_2 via the diode 12, the resistance<br>
element 14, the trigger-use capacitor 16_2 and the primary side<br>
winding 16_3a of the trigger coil 16_3.<br>
Next, a trigger pulse is applied to the control terminal<br>
123 in synchronization with the action of the shutter of the<br>
camera at the time of photography. Moreover, a series of pulse<br>
signals are input into the control terminal 125. Since the<br>
trigger pulse is applied to the control terminal 123, the<br>
thyristor 121 is in the on-state, and the electric power stored<br>
in the trigger-use capacitor 16_2 is discharged. An electric<br>
current flows in the primary side winding 16_3a, and an<br>
electromotive force is generated in the second side winding<br>
16_3b. This electromotive force is applied to the side<br>
electrode 16_lc of the arc tube 16_1, and a xenon gas sealed<br>
in the arc tube 16_c is excited. Meanwhile, since a series of<br>
pulse signals are input also into the control terminal 125, the<br>
IGBT element 124 starts a switching operation according to the<br><br>
series of pulse signals. The electric power stored in the main<br>
capacitor 13 is discharged through the discharge loop L9 of the<br>
( + ) side of the main capacitor 13, the anode 16_la, the cathode<br>
16_lb, the IGBT element 124, the primary side winding 16_3a and<br>
the (-) side of the main capacitor 13, and a flashlight is<br>
generated form the arc tube 16_1. Here, since the primary side<br>
winding 16_3a of the trigger coil 16_3 and the main capacitor<br>
13 are arranged in series , a peak value of a pulse current flowing<br>
in the IGBT element 124 is suppressed by the primary side winding<br>
16_3a. Therefore, a choke coil is not required, and thus the<br>
