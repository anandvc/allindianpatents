So that the device can be used in wet weather and during boating it can be made substantially waterproof.<br>
The device can also be made substantially shock resistant so that it can be used by a person engaging in activities such as hiking in rugged terrains, rock climbing and the like.<br>
In another aspect therefore the present invention resides in a mobile telephone apparatus comprising the device as hereinbefore described.<br>
The user information may include personal details such as user's and a contact person's names, addresses, contact numbers, and/or medical records, and/or user's photograph, and/or voice or text message relating to intended activity and location, and/or mobile telephone cell location, and/or device operation mode.<br>
Typically the user information can be transmitted for storage through the world Wide Web (WWW) and/or a telephone connection.<br>
The system can be arranged so that the retrieved user information is iutomatically sent to the emergency authority. Alternatively an operator may nform the user information to the emergency authority.<br>
The system can also be arranged to remotely switch operation mode of he at least one emergency signalling device. Typically the system can be irranged so that said at least one emergency signalling device can be switched to ransmit the beacon signal for reception by the telephone or satellite network.<br>
Where a suspension signal is received from said at least one emergency ignalling device the system may oe arranged to suspend monitoring oi trie levice. The system may recommence said monitoring upon receiving a new egistration signal from said device.<br>
In a preferred form the emergency network is arranged to receive the emergency contact reference through said mobile telephone network and/or the atellite network.<br>
In a typical example the system according to the present invention is in one form of an international satellite distress beacon messaging system wherein one device is a personal location beacon [PLB] which automatically sends an mergency or distress signal within a predetermined time interval in the event of  capacitation of the user. The PLB has a timer for selectively setting a time iterval and means for restarting a count of the time interval upon activation of a lanual reset switch which may be a dedicated button switch or key sequence.<br><br>
When the user set time interval is passed the PLB initiates automatic transmission of the distress signal.<br>
In so doing the user acknowledges his/her safety by restarting the count and thereby preventing the PLB from sending a distress signal upon elapse of the time from the initially set time interval.<br>
The PLB may also has an emergency switch which the user can activate for immediately initiation of transmission of a distress signal regardless of the state of the.timer. Similarly this switch can be a dedicated button switch or key sequence.<br>
The PLB may also have another dedicated switch for disabling or enabling the timer.<br>
In another typical example of the present invention the system may be a<br>
digital mobile phone messaging system using a terrestrial and/or satellite based<br>
radio communications wherein the device in the form of a mobile telephone or<br>
short messaging service (SMS) capable transceiver automatically transmits an<br>
emergency or distress signal addressed to a search and rescue (SAR) or<br>
emergency service organisation within a preset time interval in the event of<br>
incapacitation of the user. The device has a timer which is used to provide the<br>
preset time interval. Upon elapse of the preset time interval the device initiates<br>
automatic transmission of a distress signal.	The distress signal may be in a<br>
short datagram format such as a pre-programmed SMS message. A reserved network address or group of network addresses can be arranged for the purpose of receiving short datagram format distress messages. The monitoring station may include a short datagram format terminal sub-station for the monitoring of the reserved network address or group of network addresses. Upon receiving a short datagram format message the short datagram format terminal sub-station decrypts and displays the contents of the message to an operator of the monitoring station. The short datagram format terminal sub-station may be any suitable computer or intelligent terminal capable of receiving short datagram format messages and also capable to performing decryption of the message's contents and then displays these in a meaningful way on a console interface.<br>
Desirably the system of the present invention is adapted to communicate using a communications protocol for defining the contents of distress messages. Once an operator of the short datagram format terminal station has validated the distress message received, this information can be passed onto an emergency service organisation proximate to the transmitting the distress message. The information may be relayed n.a. short datagram format. In yet another typical example of the present invention the signaling device is in the form of an Internet<br><br>
communication capable portable device (client) which may communicate over a wireless or mobile network with the monitoring station (host) adapted to manage a multi-client message-scheduling timetable.   Both the client and the host device are capable of transmitting, receiving and interpreting encrypted datagrams to and from each other over the Internet using an application layer protocol specific to the system. The user of the client may send specific datagrams to the host by activation of a manual switch 0r by action such as pressing of a dedicated button or key sequence.       The host has a message-scheduling timetable data structure (timetable) for a plurality of clients. The host uses the timer as a reference for the timetable.    This timetable acts a simultaneous array of separate timers each corresponding to an individual client; referred to hereon as a timetable entry. The client may have   another timer; referred hereon as the 'onboard parallel timer' which is set in synchronisation to the timetable entry by communicating using the application layer protocol. The host timetable entry is set upon the passing of a specified time interval for this entry to initiate automatic transmission of a pre¬programmed alert message; hereon referred to as the 'alert message table entry' to a nominated third party address stored in the data structure.   The client may program the contents of this message and the nominated recipient address at an earlier time by requesting to write to its specific alert message table entry on the host using the application layer protocol.   Furthermore the GPS location of the client may be written and subsequently updated in the contents of this specific alert message table entry with each consecutive communication from client to host. The client may as required upon pressing of a dedicated button or key sequence  by  the  operator,   reset  its  timetable  entry  on  the  remote  host  in synchrony with the resetting of its onboard parallel timer thereby preventing the automatic sending of the pre-programmed alert message by the host for a further interval.   In a similar manner the automatic messaging services of the host may be dismissed by the client uhder the control its operator should they not be required.<br>
An advantage of this embodiment of the present invention is, that should the client device fail to function due to being damaged in a mishap along with the user, an alert may still be raised in the host upon the passing of a specified time interval by the relayed message to the nominated third party. This embodiment of the present invention is well suited to the hardware of existing Internet capable phone designs as it may be possible to implement as software running on such a phone.<br>
The flexibility of this embodiment of the present invention to nominate for the purpose of example a community health care organisation as the specific<br><br>
recipient address to alert messages generated o.n behalf of clients within the system may grant it a more general appeal in domestic situations. This could be used in assisting in monitoring the safety of elderly or disabled people who live alone on behalf of these health care organisations.<br>
The protocol can be adopted by the many SARs and emergency service organisations throughout the world. The protocol can be directed to the placement and encoding of relevant information into the body of a SMS datagram containing information fields such as the followings:-<br>
*	Unique emergency message service registry identifier<br>
*	Nationality of operator<br>
*	Location co-ordinates as reported by a GPS unit<br>
*	Number of persons accompanying operator<br>
*	Categorized type of activity the operator was engaged in prior to the distress such as rock climbing, orienteering or boating.<br>
*	Index numbers for government or private health records subject to the legality of the transmission of such information.<br>
Portions of this data may be encrypted and stored on a non-volatile memory device such a SIM card. The user or service provider may enter some fields of this information at time of purchase and-other fields may have be updated by the operator at the time of use as prerequisite for the timer function to be enabled.<br>
It would advantageous for the present invention to provide an audible warning alarm at a predetermined interval prior to transmitting a distress signal whereby the sounding of this alarm could notify the user an automatic distress signal transmission is imminent should he/she fail to acknowledge safety to the device to prevent it from doing so. Furthermore this audio alarm could be programmed to sound at a set of decreasing time intervals growing in intensity as the time for the automatic distress signal transmission approaches.<br>
The present invention would benefit from robust construction. A waterproof or at least water-resistant impact resistant casing capable of protecting the operation of the device despite having been dropped or struck against a hard surface is recommended for this invention. It is recommended that the present invention be given an eye-catching colour.<br>
Particular to the Mobile network embodiment of the present invention, some benefit could be gained from a procedure on power up whereby the contents of the SIM or user programmable memory module is duplicated to another memory within the device. In the event should failure occur on one of the electrical contacts to the SIM or user programmable memory module due to<br><br>
impact, operability of the device and it's ability to transmit the operator's specific data may not be lost.<br>
A small motor drive for automatic extension of the antenna is recommended for the PLB embodiment of the present invention. Prior to automatic distress signal transmission the motor drive for automatic extension of the transmission antenna may be engaged. If the antenna cannot be extended automatically within a given interval the motor will cease attempts at doing so. This will allow the transmitter to perform with the benefit of suitable antenna signal gain wherever possible.<br>
The present invention would benefit from the ability to communicate with other devices such as personal computers or other data terminal equipment for the purpose of easy operator data programming and device testing and maintenance.<br>

Figures 17 and 18 show the exchange of information at certain process steps in Figures 11 to 16.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT Referring to the drawings and initially to Figure 1 there is shown an embodiment of the emergency signaling device 10 according to the present invention. The device 10 as can be seen is in the shape of a mobile telephone having a housing body 11 with an antenna 12, a microphone 14, a speaker 16, an LCD display unit 18, an indicator light 20 and a set of buttons 22 to 30 on the front face 11 F of the body 11.<br>
Figure 2 shows the antenna 12 in an extended position for use in an area where signal reception is relatively weak. This figure also shows a numeric key pad 32 provided on a side wall US of the body 11. A power ON/OFF switch. 34 and a power saving switch 36 are also provided on the side wall IIS.<br>
Referring now to Figure 3 the body 11 has a base 11B with an opening for accessing a chamber 11C for accommodating battery units 38 for powering the device 10. The chamber 11C also has an interface (not shown) for connection with a SIMM card 40 on which are stored a user reference including a user name and a user identification number (PIN), device identification, and communications protocols. A cover part 11P is hingedly connected to the base 11B and it can be swung open for replacing the battery units 38 or the SIMM card 40. In this embodiment a piano type hinge joint is employed for the hinge connection.<br>
Referring to Figure 1 again the device 10 is adapted to display the battery status and reception signal strength on the display unit 18. Time of day, date and the current mode of operation are also displayed. The device shown in Figure 1 is in the standby mode. Other operation modes including a suspension mode can be selected by pressing an "ENTER" button 26 when the appropriate selection nenu appears on the display unit 18.<br>
A "MENU" button 24 is used to highlight the date and time components in succession for adjusting by pressing the appropriate keys of the key pad 32 and then pressing an "ENTER" button 26. The "MENU" button 24 is also used to oring up certain items stored on the SIMM card 40 and operation modes available for the device 10. These items include time delay for dialing a stored emergency telephone number and transmitting the user name and PIN, the user PIN, beacon preference and emergency voice call number. The time delay can be adjusted as described above. The user may selectively choose to enable or<br><br>
disable any of the service items by selecting ON or OFF sign on the display unit. The SIMM contents are automatically updated when the PIN or any of the items is changed. The changed PIN and operation status are also sent for updating user registration database.<br>
So that the device 10 can be used in adverse weather conditions, rugged terrains and during boating the body is made of cast metallic or a strong plastic material. An example of the cast metallic material is aluminum, and has a waterproofing membrane around all or each component parts that may be affected by moisture. For this reason a sealing material 42 is provided around a peripheral ledge about the opening in the base 11B and the cover part 11P is configured to be in snap fit over the sealing material 42.<br>
Figure 4 shows another embodiment of the device 10 according to the present invention. This embodiment is substantially similar to the Figure 1 embodiment. For clarity the same reference numerals are indicated for the same items between the two embodiments. In this embodiment the device 10 has a GPS receiver and the received GPS signals are calculated to indicate the coordination of the device 10 as shown in the display unit 18. It also has a keylock switch 44 for preventing accidental activation of the emergency switch 30. A reset switch 46 is provided for restarting the count down to the time period selected for transmitting an emergency signal. The reset switch 46 thereby extends the time for transmitting an emergency signal every time it is pressed. The menu button 24 in this embodiment is a part-of a' multi directional switch pad that includes an up navigation button 48, a down navigation button 50 and the "Select" button 26. Pressing the menu button 24 will some of the menu items of a menu page on the display unit 18. Pressing it again will progress to the next menu page and so on. The buttons 48 and 50 are used to navigate through menu items of the menu page on the display unit 18. The device 10 is programmed to highlight a menu item currently on the display unit 18. The highlighted menu item can be selected by pressing the "Select" button 26.<br>
To use the device 10 the power switch 34 must be in the ON position. Before allowing communications operations the device 10 prompts for entry of the user's PIN by pressing the appropriate numeric keys corresponding to the PIN and the "ENTER'V'Select" button 26. When the entered PIN matches the PIN stored on the SIMM card 40, the device checks the user selected preferences of operation modes and activates the modes accordingly.<br>
The device 10 then transmits a registration signal to an emergency communications network 102 of an emergency system 100 as shown in Figures 5 to 7.<br><br>
The system 100 shown in Figure 5 has a signaling device 10 that is capable of communicating with a monitoring station 120 through a satellite 108 or a mobile<br>
relay tower 106. In Figure 6 the device 10 communicates with the monitoring station 120 only through the satellite 108.<br>
Turning to Figure 7 the system 100 in this embodiment communicates with the device 10 over a land line telephone network 104 and/or a wireless communications network 106, or a satellite communications network 108. The wireless communications network in his case is a cellular mobile telephone network.<br>
The monitoring station 120 has at least one emergency service computer server 110 which has a data storage adapted to store a database of user references which include user names and corresponding user PINs and user provided information in voice and/or data formats about personal details of the users and their intended activities and locations and/or travel routes.<br>
The user may use the device 10 to place a message as a voice information for storage at the server 110. Alternatively the user can dial a specified telephone number and entering the PIN for accessing the server 110 for storage of information. A further alternative is to use the WWW to connect to the server through the emergency network 102 for storage of email messages and/or voice information. In this case the emergency network 110 is operating under the Internet protocol (IP).<br>
When the emergency or deadman/emergency switch 30 is activated the device 10 starts to count down to a user specified length of time stored in the<br>
SIMM Card 40. About 5 minutes(which can be set to different length of time by<br>
the-user) before reaching the specified length of time an audio alarm is set. The user may disable transmission of emergency signals in the form of an emergency telephone number to the system 100. if there is no intervention by the user the emergency signals will be transmitted at the expiration of said specified time. Thus the device 10 will transmit emergency signals even if the user is unable to use it.<br>
The emergency signals include the user name registered with the device 10 and the PIN. The server 110 on receiving the user name and PIN searches for a match with one of those on the storage and will display or play back any stored information under the user name. The stored information can be relayed directly to an emergency authority or an operator can contact the authority and advice the user information.<br><br>
As the location beacon 28 is automatically activated when the emergency signals are transmitted the system 100 can locate the user to at least within the cellular cell that first receives the emergency signals. The user information will inform who the user is and any preexisting medical conditions of the user. The travel details will also assists in locating the user quickly.<br>
For use in remote regions the device 10 can be switched to operate as a satellite pager transmitting the emergency signals to the emergency network 102. It can also include a GPS beacon so that the device 10 can be located by a GPS satellite. The display unit 18 in Figure 4 shows the location information derived from GPS.<br>
Turning now to Figure 8 there is shown a block diagram of major component modules of the PLB embodiment of the device 10. The PLB has a microprocessor control module 60, a 406 MHz distress signal transmitter 62, a GPS receiver module 64, an alphanumeric display module 66, a keypad array 68, output indicators 70, serial data interfaces 72, and a power supply unit 74 arranged as shown therein.<br>
The control module 60 acts as the master control circuitry. Pre¬programmed memory devices store programs for the central processing unit (CPU). Programmable non-volatile memory devices allow enhancements to these programs to be added at a time after manufacture. This type of memory also stores specific data pertaining to the user. Some of the data are used within the distress beacon's message. The CPU master program supervises communication with the other modules in the device 10. The timer is a programmable counter circuit under the control of the CPU capable of asynchronous timekeeping with respect to the CPU's functioning. The Timer has the ability to interrupt the CPU on reaching a specified count value or in some instances automatically reset the CPU if hot communicated with by the CPU within a specified interval. The control module 60 can switch the power supply 74 into a low power consumption mode of operation or 'sleep mode' under which only critical functioning is supported until the device 10 is activated by either a timer interrupt or recognisable external event such as a key press.<br>
The transmitter 62 is a radio transmitter for transmitting distress signals to the Cospas-Sarsat satellite array. This transmitter 62 is designed to adhere to the specifications of the International Cospas-Sarsat programme. The control module 60 acts as controller of this transmitter 62 and supervises the data transmitted in the distress message.<br>
The GPS module 64 has a GPS receiver decoder. Radio signals from the GPS array of satellites are detected and positional co-ordinate information is<br><br>
calculated within this module of the device upon the demand of the control module 60.<br>
The display module 66 has an illuminated display for the purpose of showing the user the status of the device 10, battery strength, watchdog counter value, positional co-ordinate information and stored user registration data under the control of the control module 60. When programmed in conjunction with the keypad array 68, the display module 66 act as an user interface whereby the user may programme the device 10 using menu based programming structure.<br>
The keypad array 68 is a group of switches for modifying or programming the control module 60 and is accessible to the user. The switches include a timer reset button, emergency beacon button, operator interface menu buttons, device on/off and keylock switches as shown in Figures 1 to 4.<br>
The output indicators 70 have a flashing 'heartbeat' LED and compact sound transducer, which acts as an audio alarm.<br>
The control module 60 controls communication with external devices such as a personal computer and a test equipment via interfaces 72. An infrared interface or wireless network protocol interface may be provide for communication without direct cable connection. A serial communication link using RS232C style adapter could be accommodated in this module.<br>
The controlled regulation circuit in the power supply 74which regulates the flow of current from the power supply 74 to other modules within the device 10 under the supervision of the control module 60. This regulation circuit also regulates battery recharging and low power modes of operation.<br>
User information may be stored in RAM or EEPROM or both.<br>
Shown in Figure 9 are certain component modules in the mobile telephone embodiment of the device 10 according to this invention. This device 10 has a GPS receiver module 76 for receiving GPS signals from GPS satellite array and a mobile telephone transceiver module 78, and a memory module 80 for storing user information.<br>
Figure 10 shows the transfer of a stress signal form the device 10 through the monitoring station 120 to the emergency service organisation shown here as a mobile phone or a computer.<br>
Figures 11 to 16 show certain process steps in an emergency communication system 100 according to the present invention. As the function of each process step in the Figures is clearly indicated and one skilled in the art will have no difficulty comprehending the process steps it is believed that there is no need to furnish additional description.<br><br>
