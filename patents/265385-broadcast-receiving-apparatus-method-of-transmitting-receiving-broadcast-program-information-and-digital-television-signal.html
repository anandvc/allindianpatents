Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
[30]	Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present<br>
invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever<br>
possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to<br>
the same or like parts.<br>
[31]	To facilitate the description of the present invention, an electronic program guide<br>
(hereinafter abbreviated EPG) of digital multimedia broadcasting is taken as an<br>
example. Yet, the present invention is not limited to this.<br>
[32]	First of all, EPG provides a user with program information according to channels.<br>
In particular, the EPG provides program information to enable a user to viewor record<br>
a specific program using the provided information. In this case, the EPG may include<br>
channels, program titles, broadcast schedules, and the like.<br>
[33]	Generally, EPG is transmitted in an encoded binary format. So, the EPG is implemented<br>
by decoding the transmitted binaries or implementing the transmitted binary<br>
information into XML (extensible markup language) to be displayed on a screen. In<br>
this case, the implementation language is not limited and the XML corresponds to an<br>
embodiment.<br>
[34]	EPG can be configured to include a pluralityof elements. In the following description,<br>
EPG implemented by XML is taken as an example to facilitate the description<br>
of the element structure of EPG. Yet, the present invention is not limited to<br>
the EPG implemented by XML only.<br>
[35]	EPG is able to include service information containing information for broadcasting<br>
station and channel information and program information containing information<br>
associated with program scheduling.<br>
[36]	The EPG is able to include ServiceInformation element as a most upper element of<br>
the service information and epg element as a most upper element of the program information.<br>
[37]	Fig. 1 is a block diagram of a hierarchical structure of Servicelnformation element<br>
among elements of EPG.<br>
[38]	Referring to Fig. 1, an example of Servicelnformation element is explainedas<br>
follows. In Fig. 1, a number shown on each element block indicates a number of the<br>
corresponding element. For instance, '0.. .*' indicates that the element corresponds to a<br>
count equal to or greater than 0. '1.. .*'indicates that the element corresponds to a count<br>
equal to or greater than 1.<br>
[39]	Servicelnformation is used as a container of ensemble element.<br>
[40]	The ensemble element can include frequency element containing frequency information<br>
and service element indicating an individual broadcast.<br><br>
[41 ]	The ensemble element or the service element can include serviceNameGroup<br>
element, mediaDescription element, CA (conditionalaccess) element, keywords<br>
element, link element, etc.<br>
[42]	The serviceNameGroup element can include short name, medium name, long name,<br>
and the like for ensemble.<br>
[43]	The mediaDescription element contains description for ensemble. The CA element<br>
can include scramble information. And, each of the keywords element and the link<br>
element can include corresponding information.<br>
[44]	The service element can include serviceID element discriminating a service, genre<br>
element indicating a genre of the service, epgLanguage element indicating a language<br>
of the service, etc.<br>
[45]	And, the EPG data is encoded by binary numbers and then transmitted according to<br>
a multimedia object transfer (MOT) protocol.<br>
[46]	The epg element is schematically explained with reference to Fig. 2 as follows.<br>
[47]	Fig. 2 is an exemplary block diagram of a hierarchical structure of epg element<br>
[48]	Referring to Fig. 2, epg element can include schedule element, program element,<br>
programGroups element, and alternateSource element.<br>
[49]	The schedule element includes information for arranging a program in a given time<br>
range. And, the schedule element can include scope element and serviceScope element.<br>
[50]	The programGroups element can be used in grouping programs and describing an<br>
event of a program within a group.<br>
[51]	The alternateSource element indicates whether EPG information can be received<br>
and used from another source.<br>
[52]	programGroup elementand program element below the programGroups element can<br>
include schduleNameGroup element, mediaDescription element, genre element,<br>
keywords element, memberOf element, link element, etc.<br>
[53]	The mediaDescription element among the above-enumerated elements includes<br>
multimedia element to enable multimedia information for a program to be transmitted.<br>
[54]	Fig. 3 is a diagram of a hierarchical structure of program information including a<br>
preview element according to one embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[55]	Referring to Fig. 3, schema of programme Type element below Program Information<br>
is explained as follows.<br>
[56]	Below the programme Type element, there exist schedulenamegroup, location, mediadescription,<br>
genre, conditional access, keywords, memberof, link, and programevent<br>
elements. And, there further exists preview element to display preview information for<br>
program information by a prescribed method.<br>
[57]	In the following description, broadcast programinformation enabling a summary of<br>
a broadcast program to be viewed in a graphic format is named 'preview'.<br><br>
[58]	The preview element can display a logo of each program according to a slide<br>
system to perform a preview function by displaying an image containing information<br>
of a program with a prescribed interval. The preview element is not limited to this<br>
function but can perform various functions according to the slideshow format. In the<br>
drawing, a preview type meaning a preview function is shown.<br>
[59]	The preview element enables a structure to be placed as a direct child element of the<br>
programme Type. Alternatively, the preview element can be locatedbelow the medi-<br>
adescription element or the programevent element. These are just exemplary. A<br>
position of the preview element can be located at a position indicating program information<br>
but is not limited to a specific embodiment. So, Fig. 3 shows various embodiments of<br>
the position of the preview element simultaneously.<br>
[60]	Fig. 4 is a diagram of detailed structure and attribute of a preview element<br>
according to one embodiment of the present invention, and Fig. 5 is a diagram of XML<br>
structure for preview function implementation of EPG information according to one<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[61]	Referring to Fig. 4 and Fig. 5, preview element includes slideview element<br>
displaying preview information asa still picture according to a slideshow format and<br>
videopreview element displaying preview information as a moving picture. In the<br>
embodiment of the present invention, the slideshow format preview among the preview<br>
types is taken as an example.<br>
[62]	For convenience of explanation, a slide type display of program information is<br>
described as a slidepreview type.<br>
[63]	Slideshow format means a type that a plurality of still images are outputted one by<br>
one with a prescribed interval to configure a prescribed story. Information of a<br>
displayed slidepreview includes a plurality of still pictures of a specific scene of a<br>
program. In this case, it is able to configure slide images mainly with good scenes or<br>
synopsis images. Namely, by proposing schematic images of a program, it is able to<br>
help a viewer selecting a program.<br>
[64]	It is able to insert the slidepreview type as zero to infinity. In case of 0, it means<br>
that the slidepreview type is not inserted. The slidepreview type has a slideshow<br>
attribute and includes image element as a child element. In this case, the image element<br>
has various elements.<br>
[65]	The preview element has a name attribute, and the slidepreview element has an<br>
interval attribute or a previewtype attribute. Moreover, the slidepreview element<br>
includes image element.<br>
[66]	The interval element means a time for which each image displayed in a slideshow<br>
format is displayed on a screen. One image is displayed on the screen for a time<br>
designated by the interval attribute and then turned to a next image. And, the interval<br><br>
can be defined as a number except a negative number.<br>
[671	The previewtype attribute (not shown in the drawing) indicates a type of a preview<br>
slide and at least one value can be given to the previewtype attribute. In particular, 0 or<br>
a positive value can be given to the previewtype. If the previewtype is set to 0, it<br>
means a case that the previewtype is not given. If the previewtype is set to a positive<br>
number, there exist a type count amounting to the positive number.<br>
[68]	For example, the previewtype is able to separate atype according to a timing point<br>
for a preview slide to indicate a synopsis of a program broadcasted in the past, at the<br>
present, or in the future, a bit rate of an image, or a resolution for standard definition or<br>
high definition. This is just exemplary but does not put limitation on the previewtype<br>
of the present invention.<br>
[69]	The image element includes information for image displayed in the slideshow<br>
format. Slide images are displayed without limitation put on its count. The image<br>
element has path attribute, mimevalue attribute, and size attribute.<br>
[70]	The path attribute defines an address or protocol of a resource and is represented as<br>
a string.<br>
[71]	Namely, the path attribute is an attribute proposing a path of graphic providing<br>
preview information in a slideshow format. So, graphic is paged owing to the address<br>
proposed by the path attribute. Any path capable of designating a path for receiving an<br>
image file us usable as the path. For instance, in case of designating http, it can be<br>
transferred via Internet. In case of designating DAB, it can be transferred via<br>
broadcasting.<br>
[72]	This is just exemplary. And, other communication paths are usable. As an example<br>
of a format for designating a path, there is 'url'. The url is able to designate telephone,<br>
fax, SMS, postal address, e-mail, world wide web (www), wireless application<br>
protocol (wap), DAB, and other programme withina service.<br>
[73]	The mimevalue attribute proposes a resource type attribute. In particular, the<br>
mimevalue attribute means an extension of a still image as a target of a slideshow. The<br>
extension of the still image includes bmp, jpg, jpeg, or the like.<br>
[74]	The size attribute can have attributes of width information and height information.<br>
The width attribute indicates a horizontal size of an image and the height attribute<br>
indicates a vertical size of the image. And, the size attribute can be defined as a<br>
number not zero.<br>
[75]	The attribute is written in a loop format to display each image in a slideshow<br>
format.<br>
[76]	Fig. 6 is a diagram of XML schema of mediadescription elementas a child element<br>
of program type element of EPG data. Fig. 7 shows XML schema for a preview<br>
function implementation in a slideshow format of EPG information according to<br><br>
another embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[77]	Fig. 7 is a diagram of a position of slidepreviewtype element, in which the slide-<br>
previewtype element is placed below mediadescription element.<br>
[78]	The attribute and child element of the slidepreviewtype are same. Yet, a position of<br>
the slidepreviewtype is below that of mediadescription element among schedule-<br>
namegroup, location, mediadescription, genre, conditional access, keywords,<br>
memberof, link, and programevent types as child elements of the programtype.<br>
[79]	In this case, the mediadescription is placed below program, programevent, and programgroup.<br>
So, by inserting slidepreviewtype below the mediadescription element, it is<br>
able to add a preview function to the program, programevent, and programgroup.<br>
[80]	Fig. 8 is a diagram of a program table on a screen on which slidepreview service of<br>
EPG information according to the present invention is displayed.<br>
[81]	Referring to Fig. 8, a viewer clicks an interesting program to view a slidepreview<br>
image. If a preview image of a program exists, it is able to display the preview image<br>
on a screen together with a program title.<br>
[82]	If the preview image need to be turned to a sub-program instead of being displayed<br>
together with the program title, it is able to output an icon indicating a preview<br>
function together with a program to facilitate a viewer to know whether slidepreview<br>
EPG information exits. This is indicated by 'P' in Fig. 8.<br>
[83]	Fig. 9 is a diagram of a detailed operation for executing slidepreview service of<br>
EPG information according to the present invention. Fig. 9 shows an embodiment for a<br>
viewer to view a slidepreview image by clicking an interesting program in executing<br>
the slidepreview service.<br>
[84]	Referring to Fig. 9, if a program of MBC news is selected, character string information<br>
for the corresponding program appears. If a previewtype is selected and<br>
clicked, a slide image according to the selected previewtype is displayed. In the<br>
drawing, previewtype 3 among previewtype 1, 2 and 3is designated. For instance, if<br>
the previewtype 1 is assigned to preview information for a program currently<br>
broadcasted, if the previewtype 2 is assigned to preview informationfor a program<br>
broadcasted in the past, and if the preview 3 is assigned to information for a program<br>
to be broadcasted in the future, it is able to execute a preview function at a specific<br>
tuning point. In the drawing, '5 seconds' indicatesthat an interval is set to 5 seconds.<br>
So, a still image is changed with a 5-second interval to be displayed in a slideshow<br>
format.<br>
[85]	Fig. 10 is a flowchart of a method of transmitting broadcast program information<br>
according to the present invention.<br>
[86]	Referring to Fig. 10, a transmitting terminal generates the aforesaid preview information<br>
(S91), has the preview information included in EPG (S92), and then<br><br>
transmits the EPG including the preview information therein to a receiving terminal.<br>
[87]	The above explanation is applied to the preview information. The preview information<br>
is included in the EPG as preview element and then transmitted to the<br>
receiving terminal.<br>
[88]	Fig. 11 is a flowchart of a method of receiving broadcast program information<br>
according to the present invention.<br>
[89]	Referring to Fig. 11, a receiving terminal receives program information including<br>
the preview information that contains prescribed contents of a broadcast program<br>
transmitted by a transmitting terminal (S101), extracts the preview informationfrom<br>
the program information (S102), and then displays the extracted preview information<br>
on a screen in a slideshow format (S103).<br>
[90]	In particular, the preview information is received by being included in the EPG as<br>
preview element for providing a preview function.<br>
[91]	The preview element has an interval attribute designating a prescribed interval for<br>
displaying images. And, the images are displayed on the screed with the designated<br>
prescribed interval.<br>
[92]	The preview element further executes a step of receiving a selection signal of a<br>
preview type with a previewtype attribute for designating the preview type. In<br>
particular, if a signal for selecting a user-specific type from at least one preview type,<br>
the type selected from various preview versions is displayed.<br>
[93]	The preview element includes at least twoimage elements for designating an image<br>
to be displayed in a slideshow format.<br>
[94]	One image elementof the at least two image elements has a path attribute for<br>
designating a path for paging a still image displayed in the slideshow format. So, the<br>
image is brought via the path designated by the path attribute and the displayed on the<br>
screen.<br>
[95]	The image element has a mimevalue attribute for designating an extension of a still<br>
image and brings an image file designated extension of the still image.<br>
[96]	The image element has a size attribute for designating a size of image and then<br>
brings the image of the designated size.<br>
[97]	Fig. 12 is a block diagram of a broadcast receiving apparatus according to one<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[98]	Referring to Fig. 12, a broadcast receiving apparatus according to one embodiment<br>
of the present invention includes a tuner 101, a demodulating unit 102, a DAB decoder<br>
103, a memory 104, a first audio decoder 105, an error correctingdecoder 106, an<br>
MPEG2 demux 107, a second audio decoder 108, a video decoder 109, an object<br>
descriptor (OD) decoder 110, and a BIFS (binary format for scenes) decoder 111.<br>
[99]	In this case, the error correcting decoder 106, the MPEG2 demux 107, the second<br><br>
audio decoder 108, the video decoder 109, the OD decoder 110, and the BIFS decoder<br>
111 occasionally configure aDMB decoder.<br>
[100] For the XML EPG parsing according to the present invention, the broadcast<br>
receiving apparatus further includes a packet decoder 112,a data group decoder 113, an<br>
MOT decoder 114, a binary EPG parser 115, an XML EPG parser 116, an EPG engine<br>
121, an EPG browser 122, and a database (DB) 123.<br>
[101] The tuner 101 tunes a signal corresponding to an ensemble among broadcast signals<br>
including program information, converts the tuned signal to a baseband frequency, and<br>
then outputs the converted signal.<br>
[102]	The demodulating unit 102 demodulates the frequency-converted signal into a demodulated<br>
signal according to a transmission format and then outputs a transport frame<br>
including a synchronization channel, an FIC (fast informationchannel), and an MSC<br>
(main service channel).<br>
[103] The DAB decoder 103 decodes the FIC (fast information channel), extracts an<br>
ensemble label as MCI (multiplex configuration information), a service label, and a<br>
virtual channel number assigned to the service, generates a channel map from the<br>
extracted information, and then stores the channel map in the first storage unit 104.<br>
[104] The DAB decoder 103 is able to extract real data by decoding the MSC. If the<br>
extracted data is an audio signal, the DAB decoder 103 outputs the audio signal to the<br>
first audio decoder 105. If the extracted data is a data stream, the DAB decoder 103<br>
outputs the data stream to the error correcting decoder 106.<br>
[105] The firstaudio decoder 105 is capable of decoding and outputting an audio signal<br>
compressed and encoded by such an encoding scheme as MUSICAM (masking pattern<br>
adapted universal sub-band integrated coding and multiplexing).<br>
[106] The error correcting decoder 106 performserror correction of the data stream and<br>
then outputs the error-corrected data stream to the MPEG2 demux 107.<br>
[107] The MPEG2 demux 107 performs transport stream depacketizing, PES (packetized<br>
element stream) depacketizing, SL (sync layer) depacketizing and the like on the error-<br>
corrected data stream to separate into audio, video, object description, and BIFS<br>
(binary format for scenes) data and then outputs the separated data to the corresponding<br>
decoders 108,109,110, and 111, respectively.<br>
[108]	The decoders 108, 109,110, and 111 decode the audio, video, object description,<br>
and BIFS (binary format for scenes) data by considering the corresponding formats and<br>
then outputs the decoded data. For instance, the second audio decoder 108 decodes the<br>
audio signal according to BSAC (bit slice arithmetic coding), and the video decoder<br>
109 decodes the video signal according to H.264 decoding algorithm.<br>
[109] Meanwhile, the data associated with program information by the MSC information<br>
decoded by the DAB decoder 103 is inputted to the program information decoder 120<br><br>
or 112.<br>
[110] The program information decoder 120 can include the packet decoder 112, the data<br>
group decoder, the MOT decoder 114, the binary EPG decoder 115, and the XML EPG<br>
parser 116.<br>
[111] The packet decoder 112 extracts data transported by a transport protocol by packet<br>
unit and then outputs the extracted data,<br>
[112] The data group decoder 113 groups the data outputted from the packet decoder 112<br>
and then outputs the grouped data.<br>
[113] The MOT decoder 113 outputs the grouped data in a file format according to MOT<br>
(multimedia object transfer) algorithm.<br>
[114]	The binary EPG decoder 115 generated an EPG file, which can be implemented as<br>
XML, by parsing binary EPG syntax. In particular, by giving an identifier in the binary<br>
format and parsing a value set in the binary format, the EPG file is generated.<br>
[115]	The XML EPG parser 116 parses the XML-formatted EPG file and then outputs the<br>
parsed file. And, the XML EPG parser 116 is capable of parsing an XML schema<br>
including broadcast program information for preview.<br>
[116] The EPG engine 121 is cable of storing the result parsed by the XML EPG parser<br>
116 in the database 123 and processing the parsed result.<br>
[117] As mentioned in the foregoing description, since the XML is an exemplary means<br>
for implementing EPG, if the EPG isnot implemented by XML, the XML EPG parser<br>
116 is an optional element that is not mandatory for the broadcast receiving apparatus<br>
according to the present invention.<br>
[118] And, the EP output unit 122 outputs the EPG information stored or processed by the<br>
EPG engine to a screen. A preview selecting item can be displayed on the screen by<br>
the EPG output unit 122. If a user selects the preview selecting item, a summary of the<br>
corresponding program can be displayed on the screen by the slideshow browser 124<br>
in a graphic format, and more particularly, in a slideshow format.<br>
Mode for the Invention<br>
[119]	Various modes acccording to embodiments of the present invention are described<br>
above.<br>
