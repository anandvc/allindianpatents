PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following complete specification particularly describes the invention and the<br>
manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to exhaust system for vehicles in general and more particularly to silencer unit used in exhaust system and mounting of exhaust system on vehicles.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Normally exhaust systems are used in vehicles to maintain the desired exhaust emission level and exhaust noise level as per norms.<br>
The conventional exhaust system of a vehicle mainly consists of exhaust manifold, catalytic converter, flexible bellow, intermediate pipe, silencer assembly and tail pipe. Wherein one end of said exhaust manifold is connected to engine manifold and other end is connected to catalytic converter. Other end of said catalytic converter is connected to silencer assembly through said flexible bellow and intermediate pipe. Said intermediate pipe is supported on underbody through one or more rubber hangers. Said silencer assembly is also mounted on underbody through one or more rubber hangers. Outlet of said silencer assembly is connected to tail pipe.<br>
The drawback associated with said conventional exhaust system is that, this requires flexible element as one of the important component, which is prone to frequent failure. As silencer assembly is directly mounted to vehicle under body the vibrations are directly transferred to the passengers as complete elimination of transfer of vibrations is not possible.<br>
OBJECTS OF INVENTION<br>
The main object of this invention is to provide exhaust system for vehicles and its rigid mounting arrangement without any transfer of vibrations to cabin.<br>
2<br><br>
Another object of this invention is to provide Exhaust system for vehicles and its rigid mounting arrangement with silencer assembly made in two halves.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to provide Exhaust system for vehicles and its rigid mounting arrangement with silencer assembly having ribs on its shells.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to provide Exhaust system for vehicles and its rigid mounting arrangement, which is simple in construction and cost effective.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
Exhaust system for vehicles and its mounting arrangement in accordance with this invention basically comprises of exhaust manifold, catalytic converter, mounting means for catalytic converter, intermediate pipe, silencer assembly, mounting means for silencer assembly and tail pipe. Wherein one end of said exhaust manifold is connected to engine manifold and other end is connected to catalytic converter. Second end of said catalytic converter is supported on power train through its mounting means. Said mounting means of catalytic converter assist in holding and mounting said catalytic converter in required position without inducing any stress on it. Said second end of catalytic converter is connected to silencer assembly through intermediate pipe. Said silencer assembly is mounted on said power train through its mounting means.<br>
Said mounting means of silencer assembly assists in holding and mounting said silencer assembly in required position without inducing any stress on it. Outlet of said silencer assembly is connected to tail pipe. Internal construction of silencer consists of perforated tubes and baffles for the expansion of exhaust gases.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
Referring now to the drawings wherein the showings are for the purpose of illustrating a preferred embodiment of the invention only, and not for the purpose of limiting the same.<br>
Referring to figs. 1 to 7,<br>
Exhaust system for vehicles and its rigid mounting arrangement in accordance with this invention comprises of exhaust manifold (1), catalytic converter (2), mounting means (16) for catalytic converter, intermediate pipe (5), silencer assembly (6), and mounting means (17) for silencer assembly and tail pipe (9). Wherein one end of said exhaust manifold (1) is connected to engine manifold (not shown) and other end is connected to catalytic converter (2). Second end of said catalytic converter (2) is<br>
4<br><br>
supported on power train (18) through its mounting means (16). Said mounting means (16) of catalytic converter comprises of two L shaped brackets, one bracket (3) for catalytic converter end and other bracket (4) for power train end. Said brackets (3, 4) are adjustably fastened together through slots (19,20). Said bracket (3) is fastened to Second end of said catalytic converter (2) and said bracket (4) is fastened to power train (18). Said brackets (3, 4) are provided with slots (19, 20) to provided desirable adjustment during assembling. Mounting means (16) of catalytic converter assist in holding and mounting said catalytic converter (2) in required position without inducing any stress on it. Said brackets (3,4) are provided with stiffener (23,24) respectively to improve their strength.<br>
Said second end of catalytic converter (2) is connected to silencer assembly (6) through intermediate pipe (5). Said silencer assembly (6) is mounted on said power train (18) through its mounting means (17). Said mounting means of silencer comprise of Y shaped bracket (7) and flange mounting bracket (8). Said silencer assembly (6) is made in two halves (10, 11). Said half (10) is having outer shell (12) and inner shell (13). Said half (11) is having outer shell (14) and inner shell (15). Said outer and inner shells (12, 14 and 13, 15) are provided with plurality of ribs in order to improve stiffness. Said two halves (10, 11) are joined together, preferably by means of seam welding. Said outer and inner shells (12, 14 and 13, 15) are made of same material or different material in order to improved thermal performance at hotter inner end. Internal construction of silencer consists of perforated tubes and baffle walls for the expansion of exhaust gases.<br>
Said Y shaped bracket (7) is suitably flanged to improve its strength and it is welded to said silencer (6). Said 'Y' shaped bracket (7) is provided with this particular shape to give positive support to said silencer. Said bracket (7) is adjustably fastened to flanged shaped bracket (8) through slots (21, 22). Said flanged shaped bracket (8) is mounted on power train through fasteners. Said mounting means (17) of silencer<br>
5<br><br>
assembly (6) assist in holding and mounting said silencer assembly in required position without inducing any stress on it.<br>
The outlet of said silencer (6) is connected to said tailpipe (9) and is opened to atmosphere to exit the exhaust gases.<br>
Thus the silencer mounting means are not directly connected to the underbody of the vehicle therefore assist in preventing the transfer of vibrations from exhaust system to the passenger cabin. The ribbing patterns provided on shells of the silencer increase the stiffness of the silencer thereby shifting the natural frequency of the silencer system away from the exciting frequencies of the engine to avoid resonance.<br>
The foregoing description is a specific embodiment of the present invention. It should be appreciated that this embodiment is described for purpose of illustration only, and that numerous alterations and modifications may be practiced by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. It is intended that all such modifications and alterations be included insofar as they come within the scope of the invention as claimed or the equivalents thereof.<br>
