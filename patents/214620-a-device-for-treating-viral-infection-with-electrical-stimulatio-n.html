				<td>Background of the Invention<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to a method and apparatus for delivering electrical stimulation to pathological tissue,<br>
and more particularly, to treating viral infections by applying a series of electrical pulses having different maximum<br>
amplitudes to the affected skin or mucosa.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
Viruses are the smallest infectious agents being about 5 nanometers in diameter and contain single or double<br>
strands of a single nucleic acid, either DNA or RNA, which retain the information and direct the cell to construct a<br>
series of polypeptides and enzymes. The cell, under virus direction, then assists in replication of the nucleic acid and<br>
assembles viral proteins into a protective coat, the capsid. The mature particles, called virions, consist of the naked<br>
nucleocapsid in some virus families, whereas in other families the virion has an outer envelope. This envelope is added<br>
when the nucleocapsid buds through modified cell membranes in which viral proteins have replaced cell proteins. The<br>
virion structure facilitates transmission of the informational viral nucleic acid to other cells. The capsid is about 100<br>
nm in diameter, is extremely rigid, and contains 162 capsomers. The viral nucleic acid contains information necessary<br>
for programming the infected host cell.<br>
Herpes is an ancient virus that affects millions of Americans and is highly prevalent worldwide. In Greek,<br>
the word "herpes" means "to creep." Since ancient times, herpes has crept into the lives of millions of people. The<br>
most extensive barrier to virus entry is the skin, since the intact epidermis is covered by the stratum comeum, a layer<br>
of dead keritonized cells that will not support viral replication. Therefore, penetration of the virus through the skin<br>
requires that this barrier be broached by a bite, such as by an infected anthropod, or a rabid dog, or by human<br>
injection, such as by vaccination, blood transfusion, or contaminated hypodermic needle.<br>
There are eight identified herpes viruses that have been associated with human disease conditions. The<br>
alpha-herpes viruses, HSV-1, HSV-2, and VZV-2, known as oral herpes, genital herpes, and herpes zoster respectively,<br>
are neurotropic since they actively infect nervous tissue. Five other herpes viruses are lymphotropie since they<br>
replicate in the lymphatic system. These include HCMV (human cytomegalovirus), HHV-6, HHV-7, HHV-8 (KHSV) and<br>
EBV. HHV-6 has been associated with multiple sclerosis. HHV-8 (KHSV) and EBV have been linked to the human<br>
cancers Kaposi"s sarcoma and Epstein-Barr disease.<br>
Disease conditions are also caused by a variety of other viruses. Viral hepatitis is a serious liver disease of<br>
particular concern for healthcare professionals. One form of hepatitis, hepatitis C, is considered responsible for<br>
approximately 10,000 deaths per year. The human papilomavirus (HPV) is responsible for most of the cervical cancers<br>
worldwide, genital warts and the formation of verrucae, warts that form on the soles of the feet. HPV has also been<br>
associated with several oral cancers. In addition, the HIV virus has killed more than 19 million people and infected 34<br>
million more, causing an epidemic that will continue to devastate communities around the world.<br>
There are two types of herpes simplex virus (HSV): type 1 (HSV-1) and type 2 (HSV-2). and both types are<br>
neurotropic because they actively infect nervous tissue. Under a microscope, HSV-1 and 2 are virtually identical,<br>
sharing approximately 50% of their DMA. Both types infect the body"s mucosal surfaces, usually the mouth or<br>
genitals, and then establish latency in the nervous system. Both types can recur and spread even when no symptoms<br>
are present.<br>
HSV-1 typically infects the lips, mouth, or nasal membranes. These sores, which are known as cold sores<br>
and fever blisters, are not related to sexual activity, but HSV-1 can also infect the genitals and causes up to one-third<br>
of the genital herpes cases. Usually though, HSV-2 causes genital herpes, and doesn"t cause oral lesions. The<br>
primary difference between the two viral types is in where they typically establish latency in the body, their "site of<br>
preference." HSV-1 usually establishes latency in the trigeminal ganglion, a collection of nerve cells near the ear.<br>
From there, it tends to recur on the lower lip or face. HSV-2 usually sets up residence in the sacral ganglion at the<br>
base of the spine. From there, it recurs in the genital area.<br>
Oral Herpes: The HSV-1 Virus<br>
HSV infections of the oral tissues are among the most common infectious illnesses involving man. Both<br>
primary (initial) and recurrent forms of the infection occur, these being referred to as acute primary herpetic gingivo<br>
stomatitis, and recurrent herpes labialis. Although oral herpes infections may be considered primarily nuisance<br>
diseases, gingivostomatitis can be a very painful and debilitating illness, while recurrent oral herpes in<br>
immunosuppressed subjects may be severe and even life-threatening (Overall, 1979; Ho, 1979; Faden et al, 1977}.<br>
The vast majority of oral herpes infections are caused by the HSV type 1 strain. There are no precise data<br>
for the frequency of oral herpes infections. It is estimated that there are about 500,000 cases of herpes stomatitis<br>
each year in the U.S. Recurrent herpes labialis occurs in approximately one-third of the population and the mean<br>
number of episodes per year in individuals with recurrent disease is 1.6 (Overall, 1979). This projects at about 100<br>
million episodes of herpes labialis in the U.S. each year.<br>
There are several factors that contribute to the significance of oral herpes infections. First, herpes<br>
gingivostomatitis can be a severe illness. Fever, toxicity, and exquisitely painful mouth lesions may interfere with<br>
fluid intake and require hospitalization for intravenous fluids. Second, frequent recurrent lesions of the lips are of<br>
cosmetic concern, particularly in females. Third, cold sores may be the source of HSV for transmission to<br>
immunosuppressed or other hospitalized patients. Fourth, oral herpes in the immunosuppressed patient is often a<br>
severe, life-threatening disease. Finally, there is currently no satisfactory and effective form of therapy for either<br>
primary or recurrent mucocutaneous HSV disease in the normal host.<br>
Most patients develop vesicles within 12 hours, which rupture to form ulcers or crusts in 36 to 48 hours.<br>
Most patients lose the crust and have healed ulcers by day 8 to 10. Results from clinical trials on recurrent herpes<br>
labialis has shown that about 25% of patients had episodes one or more times a month, almost two-thirds had one<br>
episode every 2-4 months, and less than 25% had an episode less often than every 4 months (Spraunce et al, 1977).<br>
Genital Herpes: The HSV-2 Virus<br>
Despite the emphasis and publicity on safe sex to prevent AIDS, a recent study by the Centers for Disease<br>
Control has shown that genital herpes has increased fivefold among white teenagers since the late 1970"s. and<br>
doubled among whites in their 20"s Wew Eng. J. of Medicine,October 16,1997). One in five Americans over the age<br>
of 12 years carries the virus that causes genital herpes, with 500,000 new cases occurring each year.<br>
It is currently standard practice in the U.S. to perform Cesarean delivery on pregnant women with recurrent<br>
herpes to reduce the risk of transmission of the virus to newboms V. Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology, Oct. 1996). In spite<br>
of this, 20-30% of all infants bom via Cesarean delivery still have the herpes virus. More than 40% of newboms<br>
infected with HSV die or suffer neurologic impairment. What exacerbates this problem is that women are 45% more<br>
likely to be infected with HSV-2 than men. Since there has been a dramatic increase in genital herpes among the<br>
younger generations, it means that a substantial number of women entering their childbearing years are infected with<br>
HSV-2, or are at risk of contracting infection. Despite antiviral therapy, neonatal herpes is still a major life<br>
threatening infection.<br>
After inoculation and limited replication at genital sites, HSV-2 ascends along neuronal axons to establish<br>
latent infection in the lumbosacral ganglia. During this initial phase, infectious virus is present at genital sites for days<br>
or weeks, usually without lesions. When a new cycle of viral replication is triggered, reactivation occurs and<br>
infectious virus is delivered back down the neural pathways to the mucosa or skin. The return of infectious virus to<br>
genital sites during HSV-2 reactivation rarely causes any symptoms. HSV-2 is a chronic, persistent infection that<br>
causes subclinical reaction in about 1 % of infected persons. Since about 45-50 million people in the U.S. are<br>
infected, HSV-2 can spread efficiently and silently through the population. People who have sexual contact with<br>
many partners will frequently have exposure to an infected person who is shedding HSV-2. As the overall prevalence<br>
of HSV-2 infection continues to rise, contact with fewer partners will permit exposure.<br>
The concept that HSV persists in the nuclei of cells in the sensory ganglia suggests that any topical<br>
treatment will be ineffective in destroying the virus in these hidden locations. About 25 viruses have been placed in<br>
the HSV group and they all contain a core of double stranded DNA surrounded by a protein coat that exhibits<br>
isocahedril symmetry. This in turn is enclosed in an envelope that contains essential lipids. The structural proteins of<br>
herpes simplex virus include nine polypeptides that have been found in the enveloped virion, two polypeptides that are<br>
associated with the envelope, two arginine polypeptides within the virus core, as well as guanine and cytosine. The<br>
virus enters the ceil either by fusion with the cell membrane or by pinocytosis. It is then uncoated and the DNA<br>
becomes associated with the nucleus. Soon after infection the virus codes for its own DNA polymerase and other<br>
enzymes such as thymidine kinase which is associated with the DNA replication.<br>
A variety of treatments have been used for genital herpes but none is entirely satisfactory. No satisfactory<br>
vaccine has been found. In superficial infections, topical agents such as ldoxuridine, Triflurothymidine, or Acyclovir<br>
are sometimes effective. The drug of choice for the treatment of herpes simplex is Acyclovir, which is the only FDA<br>
approved drug. Sales of Zovirax® (Burroughs Wellcome) were given at about $500M. Annual estimated sales for this<br>
product exceeded $2 billion worldwide in 1997. Administered orally for systemic absorption, Acyclovir is limited by<br>
several factors:<br>
1} side effects include rash, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or pain, burning or itching at the site where<br>
the drug is applied, anorexia and possible eye injuries.<br>
2) cost; the average annual cost to a patient is around $ 1000.<br>
3) emergence of drug-resistant virus strains.<br>
4) presence of a large number of "early reactivation" patients for whom Acyclovir does not work.<br>
5) a 6-10 day treatment cycle; patients with HSV-1 (oral herpes/cold sores) must decide if treatment<br>
is worth 6-10 days use of an expensive systemic drug with potential side effects.<br>
First episodes of the virus should all be treated as early as possible with one of three available oral antiviral<br>
agents. Effective treatments include: Acyclovir (Zovirax™) where the usual dose is 200 mg five times daily;<br>
Valacyclovir HCI (Valtrex™) is an improved oral formulation of Acyclovir which requires less frequent dosing at 500 mg<br>
twice daily; Fanciclovir (FamvirTM) is the oral formulation of penciclovir and it is dosed for primary infections at 250<br>
mg three times daily. Studies have proven all three drugs to be equally effective. In North America, first episode<br>
treatment is generally prescribed for 10 days, but in Europe and the UK, treatment is generally prescribed for 5 days.<br>
These antiviral medications can be taken orally very early in a recurrent episode.<br>
Herpes Zoster<br>
Herpes zoster, also known as shingles, is due to invasion of posterior root ganglia by the causative virus and<br>
is characterized by severe pain followed by a rash aver cutaneous distribution of the affected nerve. The virus,<br>
varicella-zoster (VZ), causes two diseases, varicella (chickenpox) resulting from the first exposure to the virus in<br>
childhood, and zoster, a secondary infection due to reactivation of the latent VZ virus. Shingles is a painful and<br>
potentially debilitating disease that affects 750,000 people each year in the U.S. The condition is most commonly<br>
experienced by older Americans and is caused by a reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus, the same herpes virus<br>
that causes chickenpox. A major challenge for physicians in managing patients with shingles is alleviating the severe<br>
pain associated with an active shingles rash, as well as postherpetic neuralgia (long-term debilitating pain), which may<br>
occur following rash healing.<br>
Herpes and Multiple Sclerosis<br>
A strain of reactivated herpes virus may be associated with multiple sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune disorder<br>
in which the body attacks its own tissues. Results of a study conducted by scientists at the National Institute of<br>
Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) in Bethesda, Maryland, add to mounting evidence of the role of viral<br>
triggers in MS and may serve as the cornerstone for clinical trials using antiherpetic agents as a treatment. This is<br>
the first published large-scale study suggesting an association of a human herpes virus in the disease process of MS.<br>
In the study, more than 70 percent of patients with the relapsing-remitting form of MS showed an increased immune<br>
response to human herpes virus-6 (HHV-6) and approximately 35 percent of all MS patients studied had detectable<br>
levels of active HHV-6 in their serum. Scientists believe that there may be a point in time during the progression of MS<br>
when the virus, which lies dormant in the body for years, reactivates, accounting for its presence in a subset of MS<br>
patents. The study appears in the December 1997 issue of Nature Medicine.<br>
As many as 350,000 Americans are affected by MS, which is most often diagnosed in patients between the<br>
ages of 20 and 40 and is characterized by muscle weakness, visual disturbances, and a variety of other neurological<br>
impairments. The array and severity of symptoms varies widely from patient to patient and women are more likely to<br>
be affected than men. The most common form of MS is the relapsing-remitting type. In this type of MS, new<br>
symptoms appear or existing ones become more severe, followed by periods of partial or total recovery. These<br>
flare-ups of new or intensified symptoms last for variable amounts of time. A second form of MS is a chronic and<br>
progressive one in which symptoms steadily worsen. HHV-6 is relatively new to scientists and is known to cause a<br>
common childhood illness, roseola. HHV-6 is known to be present in 90 percent of the adult American population as a<br>
result of infection during the first few years of life. Scientists believe that the reactivation of HHV-6 virus may be<br>
associated with the breakdown of the protective covering of nerves, called myelin. Reactivation is characteristic of<br>
herpes viruses. In the study, investigators screened the serum of 102 individuals, 36 of whom had MS. Of the 22<br>
individuals with the relapsing-remitting form of MS, 73 percent had an increase in immune response to an early<br>
antigen of HHV-6, compared to onfy 18 percent of those participants who served as normal volunteers. In addition,<br>
the scientists detected HHV-6 DNA in the serum {a marker of active virus infection) of 15 of 50 individuals with MS.<br>
All 47 individuals without MS tested negative for the presence of active HHV-6 viral infection.<br>
Human Papillomavirus<br>
Human papillomavirus (HPV) is one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases. Genital HPV<br>
infections are widespread among sexually active adults. It is estimated that as many as 40 million Americans are<br>
infected with HPV, and the incidence of the disease appears to be increasing. More than 1000 types of HPV have<br>
been identified. Some cause common skin warts. Others are spread through sexual contact and result in genital<br>
warts.<br>
HPV often results in an infection without any visible symptoms. Thus, individuals may not be aware of the<br>
infection or of the potential risk of transmission to others. Genital warts are spread by sexual contact and are highly<br>
contagious. Approximately two-thirds of people who have sexual contact with a partner with genital warts will<br>
develop warts, usually within about three months of contact.<br>
In women, the warts occur on the outside and inside of the vagina, on the cervix, and around the anus. In<br>
men, the warts occur on the penis, scrotum, and around the anus. Genital warts often occur in clusters, and can be<br>
very tiny or can occur in large masses. Treatment includes the application of trichloracetic acid or podophyliin<br>
solution. Warts can be removed by cryosurgery, electrocautery or surgery. Although elimination of the warts is<br>
possible, the viral infection persists and warts often reappear after treatment.<br>
To date, there are very few satisfactory treatments, vaccines, or cures for viral infection. Drug treatments,<br>
either topical or ingested, have shown generally limited benefits. As an alternative to the pharmaceutical approach,<br>
the electrical stimulation of infected tissues has been explored. These methods involve the application of electrodes<br>
to the skin near the infected region. Although this technique shows promise, to date the devices and stimulation<br>
protocols used have bean less successful at eliminating viral infection than was hoped.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The systems and methods have several features, no single one of which is solely responsible for its desirable<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiment<br>
Embodiments of the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying Figures, wherein<br>
like numerals refer to like elements throughout The terminology used in the description presented herein is not<br>
intended to be interpreted in any limited or restrictive manner, simply because it is being utilized in conjunction with a<br>
detailed description of certain specific embodiments of the invention. Furthermore, embodiments of the invention may<br>
include several novel features, no single one of which is solely responsible for its desirable attributes or which is<br>
essential to practicing the inventions herein described.<br>
Referring now to FIGURE 1, there is shown one embodiment of the electrical stimulation device of the<br>
present invention, useful for treating viral infections. The device 10 includes a housing 12, which is designed to fit<br>
comfortably in the hand of the user. At one end, two electrodes 18a and 18b are mounted. The electrodes 18a, 1 Bb,<br>
have an elongated surface for application to the user"s skin. The elongated electrodes allow for larger electrode to<br>
skin surface contact. As shown in Figure 1, each electrode 18a, 18b may comprise a closed contour. In some<br>
embodiments, the electrodes 18a, 18b are concentric closed contours. In the embodiment of Figure 1, the electrodes<br>
comprise circuit traces plated onto a printed circuit board 19 that is attached to one end of the housing 12.<br>
It will be appreciated that the electrodes may take many forms and shapes. The electrodes 18a and 18b<br>
can be oval or elliptical as shown in Figure 1, rectangular as shown in FIGURE 3, or circular, as shown in FIGURE 4.<br>
They may also be square, or any other desired shape, and are preferably gold plated. However, any electrically<br>
conductive material can be used. An on/off button or switch 20 that is manually operated is located on the device,<br>
which also can include a first LED 22 that is activated when the device is turned on, and a second LED 23 that<br>
indicates a low battery condition. An alphanumeric display 25 may also be provided on the device to provide the user<br>
with a variety of information concerning device and/or treatment status.<br>
In operation, the electrodes 18a and 18b are placed in contact with the patient"s skin or mucosa, and<br>
electrical energy is delivered to the electrodes 18a and 18b when the device is turned on. As will be described in<br>
additional detail below, the treatment protocol typically involves the application of a series of electrical pulses to the<br>
affected area. In this embodiment, the display 25 may exhibit a count of the number of treatments applied, thus<br>
indicating to the user at any given time how much of the treatment protocol has been completed.<br>
FIGURE 2 illustrates the circuitry provided inside the housing 12 of some advantageous embodiments of the<br>
invention. The device will generally include a battery 16, which may be rechargeable or disposable, coupled to a<br>
logic/processor circuit 14, a signal generator circuit 17, and the display. 25. The logic/processor circuit 14 drives the<br>
display 25 and configures the signal generator circuit 17 to output the desired electrical signal to the electrodes 18a<br>
and 18b. Although shown as separate blocks in FIGURE 2, it will be appreciated that the logic/processor circuit 14<br>
and the signal generator circuit 17 may be functionally combined, and will typically reside on a common printed circuit<br>
board in the housing 12. The types of signals produced by the signal generator circuit 17 in advantageous<br>
embodiments of the invention will be described in additional detail below.<br>
The physical size and shape of the device will advantageously vary depending on the specific intended<br>
application. The embodiment illustrated in Figure 1, for example, is advantageously sized for use on the legs and<br>
genital area. In this embodiment the electrical stimulation device 10 is approximately 2-3 inches long, approximately<br>
1-1.5 inches wide, and approximately 0.5-1 inches deep. As noted above, the device 10 is sized so as to fit<br>
comfortably in the hand of the user. The circuit traces forming the concentric electrodes 18a, 18b shown in FIGURE<br>
1 are approximately 2-3 mm in width, and are plated to a thickness of less than 1 mm. As illustrated in FIGURE 3, in<br>
an alternative embodiment of the genital applicator, the end of the device 10 which mounts the electrodes is curved<br>
so that it is easier to produce contact between the skin of the patient and the entire electrode surface.<br>
Turning now to FIGURE 4, there is illustrated another embodiment of the electrical stimulation device 10.<br>
The device 10 includes a housing 12 and concentric electrodes 18a and 18b at the top end of the device 10. Here,<br>
the electrodes 18a and 18b are circular, and the center electrode 18b forms a circular pad rather than a ring. This<br>
embodiment is adapted for oral application, and advantageously measures about 0.5 to 0.75 inches in diameter with a<br>
length of about 2 inches. This is about the same size and shape of a lipstick or lip balm applicator, and thus is very<br>
convenient for carrying in a pocket or purse. In this embodiment, the display 25 may be provided on the bottom flat<br>
surface opposite the electrode surface. A cap 22 is also preferably provided for the embodiments of FIGURES 1, 3,<br>
and 4. This cap 22 fits over the top end of the device 10 where the electrodes 18a and 18b are located. The cap 22<br>
acts to protect the electrodes 18a and 18b after cleaning with alcohol or hydrogen peroxide and not in use.<br>
In FIGURES 5A, 5B, 6A and 6B there is shown still other embodiments of the electrical stimulation device<br>
10 of the present invention. In these embodiments. The device 10 includes a disposable electrode cartridge 24 which<br>
includes the battery and concentric electrodes 18a and 18b located on the contact head 26 of the device 10, which is<br>
located at the distal end 30 of the device 10. The contact head 26 can be flat (FIGURES 5A and 5B) or hemispherical<br>
in shape (FIGURES 6A and 6B). The disposable electrode cartridge 24 snaps into the housing 12, but can be easily<br>
removed for disposal. As shown in FIGURE 5C, the concentric electrodes 18a, 18b can be circular. Alternatively, as<br>
shown in FIGURE 6C, the electrodes 18a, 18b can be positioned side-by-side, each electrode comprising approximately<br>
half of a hemispherical surface separated by a strip of insulating material 26 along an equatorial line of the<br>
hemisphere. This embodiment is advantageous in that the electrodes can be removed and replaced without discarding<br>
the entire unit 10.<br>
The devices described above are used by applying the electrodes to the surface of the affected skin or<br>
mucosa and delivering electrical energy to the affected area. It has been found advantageous for a total treatment<br>
protocol to comprise a series of electrical pulses, with different pulses being different in signal characteristics. The<br>
pulses may differ in one or more of amplitude, frequency, signal type, e.g. AC or DC or any other electrical signal<br>
characteristic. It is hypothesized that the different electrical signal characteristics produce different disruptive<br>
effects on the virus, thus preventing the survival of those viruses which may already be or which may become<br>
resistant to any one form of electrical stimulation.<br>
This form of treatment protocol is illustrated in FIGURE 7, and is initiated at start block 30. At block 32, an<br>
electrical signal pise is applied. At decision block 34, it is determined whether or not the pulse just applied is the last<br>
pulse of the treatment. If not the system moves to block 36, where the device is configured to output a pulse having<br>
characteristics different from the previous pulse. Looping back to block 32, the pulse having the new desired<br>
characteristics is applied. This process continues until the last pulse of the treatment is applied, and the treatment<br>
then ends at stop block 38.<br>
As mentioned above, the pulses may differ in any one or more of a variety of characteristics. The pulses<br>
may change m maximum voltage or current amplitude. The pulses may change between AC waveforms and DC. AC<br>
pulses may vary in frequency or waveform such as triangle waves, square waves, or sine waves. As described below,<br>
in some advantageous embodiments, the pulses vary in maximum amplitude from approximately 0.1 volts to<br>
approximately 20 volts, and vary in frequency from 5 Hz to about 10 kHz. DC pulses may vary in voltage with a rango<br>
of 0.1 to 20 vote. A voltage range of 0.1-20 V may be preferred for oral herpes while a range of 3-20 V may be<br>
preferred for genital herpes.<br>
Two different specific protocols based on the principles described above have been devised. Protocol 1<br>
involves ten 30 second applications of electrical energy, with a one hour break between each one, wherein each 30<br>
second segment is itself divided into sub-segments, which in this embodiment may be 5, 1, and/or 0.2 second<br>
intervals, or less. This treatment protocol is defined as follows:<br>
If the ten applications are designated numbers 1 through 10, applications 1,3,5,7, and 9 are as follows:<br><br>
Applications 2,4,6,8 and 10 are as follows, although each is shown at 9 VAC peak it is understood that<br>
the peak voltage can range from 0.1-20 V, while 0.1-20 V may be preferred for oral herpes and 3-20 V may be<br>
preferred for genital herpes:<br>
In the above described protocol, the peak voltage remains constant at about 9 V. Referring to both the AC<br>
and the DC voltage values in Table 1 and Table 2, it should be understood that this protocol is only exemplary and the<br>
voltage used can be any voltage in the range of 0.1-20 V, although a range of 3-20 V may be preferred for genital<br>
herpes and a range of 0.1-20 V may be preferred for oral herpes. A more complex protocol, referred to herein as<br>
Protocol 2, has also been developed which includes variation in peak voltage as well as variations in waveform and<br>
frequency. In this specific protocol, nineteen different pulses that have been found useful and are set forth below in<br>
Tables 3 and 4. Twelve of the pulses are AC waveforms, and seven are DC pulses. Table 5 sets forth 10 different<br>
pulse sequences that are applied in various combinations to the affected area during a treatment protocol. Again, the<br>
peak voltage values are only exemplary and it is to be understood that any voltage in the range of 0.1-20 V, while the<br>
range of 3-20 V may be preferred for genital herpes and the range of 0.1-20 V may be preferred for oral herpes.<br>

Repeat 10 times with one hour break between each repetition.<br>
In these treatment sequences, the peak AC and DC voltages are specified but again, are only exemplary.<br>
Voltages utilized for treatment may vary from 0.1-20 VAC or VDC, and voltages from 3-20 V may be preferred in<br>
treating genital herpes while the range 0.1-20 V may be preferred for treating oral herpes. Thus, in the case of the<br>
application of a DC pulse, the maximum voltage applied may be limited by either the maximum specified in Table 4, or<br>
by the maximum specified by the particular treatment segment being applied, or may be up to 20V. Thus, If D7 is<br>
being applied at 7 V, the pulse applied is one second at 3V, one second at 4V, one second at 5V, and eight seconds at<br>
7V. However, if D7 is being applied at 20V, the pulse applied is one second each at 3V, 4V, 5V, 7V, 9V, 11V, 13V,<br>
15V, 17V, 19V, and 20V. If D1 is applied at 20 V, the pulse is one second at 3V, one second at 4V, one second at 5V,<br>
one second at 7V, and one second at 9V. AC pulses can have peak voltages as specified by the treatment segment<br>
being applied.<br>
Treatment should be begun as soon as possible after the onset of symptoms, preferably in the prodromal<br>
stage when the characteristic tingling, itching or burning sensation is felt. The distal end of the device is held to the<br>
affected skin or mucosa where symptoms are perceived, and treatment is commenced by pressing the "on" button. A<br>
designated treatment cycle of about 30 to 60 seconds is automatically initiated. The LED illuminates during this on<br>
cycle.<br>
The user generally will not feel any sensation during treatment. By the end of the 10 x 30 second<br>
consecutive treatments of Protocol 1, or by the end of Treatment 1 of Protocol 2, prodromal symptoms should cease.<br>
If symptoms continue, or if lesions occur or are still present, it is recommended that treatment be continued. Under<br>
protocol 1, this would involve a second course of 10 consecutive 30 second treatments. Under Protocol 2, Treatment<br>
2 as defined above should be administered. If, after this second course of treatments, symptoms or lesions appear or<br>
persist, a third course of ten treatments should be carried out under Protocol 1, or Treatment 3 of Protocol 2 should<br>
be applied. Finally, if symptoms still remain, Protocol 2 calls for the application of Treatment 4 as defined above.<br>
It will be appreciated that a wide variety of treatment protocols could be devised based on the principles of<br>
the invention, and that the two described abova are only two specific examples of treatment protocols with the<br>
advantageous feature of pulse variability.<br>
A number of device electrode placement protocols can be employed with the present invention and these<br>
involve various anatomical sites. Electrode placement sites may be in relationship to neural ganglia where viruses<br>
establish residence. For example, the trigeminal ganglion near the ear is a site where HSV-1 (herpes labialis)<br>
establishes residence, from which it recurs on the lower lip or face. Therefore this site is ideal for electrode<br>
placement and is located in front of the ear (external auditory meatus), below the zygomatic arch, and over the<br>
position of the facial nerve and parotid gland. Another neural ganglion example for electrode placement is the sacral<br>
ganglion at the base of the spine. This is where HSV-2 (genital herpes) sets up residence from which it recurs in the<br>
genital area.<br>
Other electrode placement sites can be in relationship to regional lymph nodes. Examples of these sites<br>
would be in the cervical chain of lymph nodes positioned bilaterally at the front of the neck, lymph nodes in the tonsil<br>
bed positioned just under the angle of the jaw (junction of horizontal and ascending ramus of mandible), in the axillary<br>
chain of lymph nodes positioned under the arms, and in the inguinal lymph nodes positioned bilaterally in the groin.<br>
Further sites for electrode placement can be in relationship to air sinuses such as those in the facial bones of<br>
the skull. Examples include the maxillary antrum positioned below the eyes and above the upper teeth, accessed by<br>
placement either side of the nose level with the eyes, and the frontal sinus positioned either side of the midline on the<br>
forehead just above the eyes.<br>
With the treatment of viral diseases that affect the whole body, and for serious and life threatening viral<br>
diseases such as HIV and AIDS, it will be necessary to carry out treatments using placements of the electrical device<br>
in other additional anatomical regions using a consecutive pattern of treatments.<br>
In one such protocol, the device is used consecutively on three different anatomical regions of the body.<br>
These three sites are referred to collectively as The Central Location." In this, the first placement site is in the<br>
center of the spine, slightly above the level of the shoulders, which is the position of cervical vertebra #7, referred to<br>
as C7. The second site is also positioned longitudinally in the center of the spine but between the neck and the base<br>
of the spine, which is at about thoracic vertebra #7 (17). The third and last position is also in the center of the spine<br>
but positioned at the base of the lumbar spine equivalent with the 5th lumbar vertebra, referred to as L5.<br>
In another protocol, a further seven anatomical placement sites are employed in addition to the above three<br>
sites of The Central Location. Whereas the three previous sites are on the back, or dorsal position, of the body, the<br>
seven additional sites are located on the front, or ventral position, of the body. These seven different anatomical<br>
regions of the body coincide with the seven "chakras" and channels of energy. Many workers have contemplated that<br>
in addition to a network of nerves and sensory organs, there also exists a subtle system of channels and centers of<br>
energy (chakras) which affects the physical, intellectual, emotional and spiritual being. These seven regions are used<br>
as electrode placement sites and are positioned in seven specific regions of the body ranging from the crown to the<br>
sternum, including regions such as the heart The seven regions are generally referred to as the crown, root, sacral,<br>
solar plexus, heart, throat, and third eye chakras. These seven locations physically correspond to the locations of the<br>
top of the head, between the anus and the genitals, between the navel and the genitals, between the navel and the<br>
base of the sternum, in the center of the chest, centrally at the base of the throat and above and between the<br>
eyebrows respectively.<br>
In these two final protocol examples of treating viral infections of the entire body, the treatment sequences<br>
shown in Table 5, and in Treatment 4, are employed whereby ten different pulse sequences are applied in various<br>
combinations. Each of the ten separate outputs ramp up consecutively through the various voltage levels resulting in<br>
a total treatment time of eight minutes and forty-five seconds in each anatomical site. This regimen may be carried<br>
out on each of either the three regions in The Central Location or, additionally, the seven chakra regions as described<br>
above, making ten anatomical sites in all.<br>
The three Central Location sites would give a total treatment time of 3 x 8 minutes and 45 seconds, which<br>
is 26 minutes and 15 seconds. The seven chakra regions would give a total treatment time of sixty-one minutes and<br>
fifteen seconds. Treatment of all ten locations would give a total treatment time of 87 minutes and thirty seconds.<br>
The entire sequence would then be repeated according to the protocol employed which could be, for example, nine<br>
repetitions, which is ten treatments in all.<br>
Use of a stimulation device in the treatment of various forms of viral infections are further described in the<br>
following specific examples.<br>
Example 1 - Oral Herpes<br>
A female subject, date of birth 3/15/75, had a twelve year history of oral herpes infections. Outbreaks<br>
tended to occur at the lip borders, especially the lower lip, and were more frequent during cold weather and during<br>
times of stress. She reported approximately four to six outbreaks per year, each lasting about 10-12 days. Previous<br>
treatments had been unsuccessful.<br>
The subject was given an electrical stimulation device as described above that was configured to apply<br>
Protocol 1 as described above. She was instructed to apply the device directly to the infected area or areas, and<br>
apply the ten 30 second treatments as described in Protocol 1 above, with a one hour break between each 30 second<br>
treatment. The device was configured to automatically step through the ten different electrical pulses as shown<br>
above as the subject applied the device for the ten consecutive 30 second periods. Thus, the subject only had to<br>
place the electrodes on the affected area, press the ON button, and wait for an LED display to turn off after 30<br>
seconds.<br>
After the first treatment, the subject reported that the small veiscles that had begun to develop started to<br>
dry up immediately after treatment. The small reddish areas indicating the onset of an outbreak disappeared<br>
completely within three days, as did any symptoms of burning or itching.<br>
Example 2 - Recurrent Genital Herpes<br>
The male subject, date of birth 12/25/55, had a history of genital herpes for the past 20 years. The<br>
outbreaks always occurred on his pens and varied from minor outbreaks to major ones. The subject reported that he<br>
had four outbreaks on average each year. He also reported that in his opinion, they often occurred in relation to<br>
stress and when he was working very hard physically.<br>
The subject had an outbreak that was preceded by prodrome symptoms. The subject reported that his<br>
thighs began to tingle and feel "funny", which is what usually happened just before an outbreak. The day following<br>
the prodrome symptoms, the subject noticed a small raised red tump on the top of the head of his penis. The subject<br>
started treatment with the device of the present invention on the red spot once every hour for a total of ten<br>
treatments using Protocol 1 as described above and as in Example 1. The subject reported that the red spot did not<br>
get any larger like ft usually did, and was not painful, also atypical since it usually was very painful by the second day.<br>
The subject reported that the red spot did not progress to the blister stage. This was the first time in his twenty-year<br>
history of having genital herpes flat an outbreak did not progress to a blister stage. The subject also reported that<br>
there was no. release of fluid, which was also unusual. The outbreak dried up and disappeared completely after the<br>
third day.<br>
The subject had another prodrome stage where the symptoms were similar to those described previously; his<br>
thighs started to tingle and burn. The subject noticed that a small outbreak had developed on the underside of his<br>
penis and appeared as a raised red spot. This became larger and the subject reported that this had all of the signs of<br>
being one of his major outbreaks that he got regularly about once a year. The subject started using the device for<br>
treatment as soon as he noticed the outbreak. He used the device every hour as instructed, positioning the tip of the<br>
device on the red raised lesion, in the same manner as described above. The lesion did not get any larger once<br>
treatment started. The subject reported that after the appearance of the red spot and commencement of treatment,<br>
there was no formation of blisters, no wetness or oozing of fluid, and no pain. The subject reported that the outbreak<br>
started to resolve itself the day after commencing treatment with the device.<br>
Seven months later, the subject reported that he noticed a little red colored spot appear on the upper side of<br>
his penis which swelled and developed into a small bump. The subject reported that there were no signs of a<br>
prodrome stage this time. He used the viral device with the same treatment regimen of once an hour, and during<br>
treatments, the small bump did not get any larger, and disappeared after a couple of days. The subject reported that<br>
this was the "best" outbreak he had in the last twenty years because there was no pain, no swelling, and no<br>
discharge, and it was all over in a couple of days.<br>
Three months later, the subject reported that he had a very small outbreak on the left rear thigh. It<br>
appeared as a small red spot but there was no evidence of any lesion on his penis. He used the viral device on top of<br>
the lesion employing the same protocol as described above, and the small lesion did not get any bigger. The subject<br>
reported that there was no blistering, no discharge and no pain. The outbreak cleared up completely in a couple of<br>
days.<br>
Five months later, the subject reported the appearance of a small red swelling on the side of his penis. As<br>
soon as he saw evidence of the outbreak he started treatment with the device using the once-an-hour protocol<br>
described above. The lesion did not progress in size, did not blister, and was not painful. It responded well to the<br>
treatment and the lesion disappeared by day three.<br>
Example 3 - Recurrent Genital Herpes<br>
Christopher Allen Dxxx: San Diego, CA<br>
Use tf the ViraCalm on Genital Herpes Outbreaks<br>
Lengitudinal Study: 2 Years 9 months to date<br>
Subject has been having herpes breakouts for 23 years and they always occur on the subject"s penis. They<br>
vary from minor ones to major ones and the subject has 4 -6 outbreaks each year. The outbreaks always become a<br>
blister and then discharge fluid, lasting anywhere from 10 days to 2 weeks. About once a year, the subject gets a<br>
really bad outbreak that lasts for 3 weeks. The outbreaks seem to occur more often when the subject is really<br>
stressed out at work.<br>
Outbreak #1: February 1999<br>
The subject has never been treated with any drugs except in February 1999 with Famvir prescribed by Dr.<br>
Daniels. The subject had a minor outbreak and took the 10 pills but when the subject had finished them, the outbreak<br>
came back. The subject went to see Dr. Daniels again and he gave the subject another prescription for 10 more pills,<br>
also at a cost of about $45, a total of $90 (insurance paid $40). The subject took the second lot of 10 pills but they<br>
still did not stop the outbreak, only slowed it down some. When the subject finished the second lot of pills, the<br>
outbreak continued on its normal course with blisters and oozing.<br>
First Use of the ViraCalm, May 1999<br>
Outbreak #2: May 16.1999<br>
The outbreak on May 16 was preceded by the prodrome that the subject usually gets where his thighs start<br>
to tingle and feel funny. The next day the subject had a small outbreak on the top of his penis. The subject started<br>
using the device right on that spot once every hour for a 30 second treatment as instructed. The small red spot did<br>
not get bigger like it usually does and was not painful. It did not progress to the blister stage, and this is the first time<br>
that the subject has had an outbreak that did not become a blister. There was no oozing or wetness, which was<br>
unusual with the subject"s outbreaks. There was no pain or discomfort, and the outbreak dried up completely by the<br>
third day.<br>
Outbreak #3: May 20,1999<br>
On May 20 the subject had another prodrome where his thighs started to tingle and burn and the subject<br>
developed a small outbreak on the bottom of his penis. This became larger and had all the signs of being one of the<br>
subject"s major outbreaks that he gets about once a year. The subject called the doctor because these are really bad<br>
and last about three weeks with blistering and a lot of oozing and pain. The subject started treating it as soon as he<br>
got the device, every hour, directly on the outbreak, just like the first time. The outbreak swelled at the beginning but<br>
did not get any bigger, and there was no blistering, no wetness, and no pain. It then started to itch, which is what<br>
usually happens right at the end of the normal outbreak after the oozing is over, when it begins to heal. The outbreak<br>
started to retreat the day after treatment with the device. The subject kept using it every hour as instructed. This is<br>
the second time in 23 years that the subject has had an outbreak without it going to a blister with oozing. The first<br>
time was when the subject used the device before. The outbreak swelled at the beginning, then retreated, had some<br>
itching, and it was all over. The subject feels very happy, claiming the device is like a miracle stopping the outbreaks<br>
with no blistering, oozing or pain, and knows that this last outbreak was the major one he gets every year.<br>
When the subject used the device, he did not feel any sensation except for one time. This was when the<br>
subject got out of the shower, his skin was dry but his hair was still wet and he had wet feet. The subject used the<br>
device on his penis and felt a little tingling, and could not keep it on for more than 15 seconds that time. The subject<br>
made sure that he was not wet and just out of the shower when he used the device again.<br>
Outbreak #4: November 26,1999 (7 months later)<br>
The subject had no prodrome, no swelling, but a little red coloration appeared on his penis, which became a<br>
small red bump or blister. The subject called the doctor to get the device. During treatments with the device, the<br>
small bump did not get any bigger and disappeared after a couple of days. This was the best outbreak the subject had<br>
in 23 years, with no pain, no swelling, and no oozing of fluid. It was allover in a couple of days.<br>
Outbreak #5: Feb 10,2000 (3 months later)<br>
The subject had what he describes as an early outbreak on the left rear thigh. The subject called the doctor<br>
and used the device for treatment over the red spot. Use of the device stopped it before the subject had an outbreak<br>
that affected his penis. It was allover within two to three days with no pain.<br>
Outbreak #6: July 25,2000 (5 months later)<br>
The subject had the normal prodrome with tingling of his thighs. One day later a small light red swelling<br>
appeared on the side of the subject"s penis. The subject got the device from the doctor and used it on the red spot for<br>
the 30 seconds treatment once every hour. After using the device there was no pain, no further spots or lesions<br>
developed, and it responded well to the device. The lesion disappeared in about 1-2 days with no swelling, vesicles or<br>
oozing.<br>
Outbreak #7: Oct 15,2000 (3 months later)<br>
The subject had a prodrome in the usual way on his thighs. Since the subject"s girlfriend has very bad oral<br>
herpes, she had Valtrex in the house so the subject took a course of ten tablets. The subject wanted to try it in case<br>
he could not get in touch with the doctor to get the device. The subject"s girlfriend spends hundreds of dollars on her<br>
drug for her oral herpes so there is always some around. This did very little for the subject. A lesion developed on his<br>
penis and then turned into a blister in spite of taking the medication. The outbreak lasted two weeks as it normally<br>
does, but was probably not as severe as it would have been if the subject had done nothing.<br>
Outbreak #8: February 5,2001 (4 months later)<br>
The subject developed a small red spot on his penis and called Or. Silverstone. The subjects used the device<br>
in the normal manner and it stopped the outbreak within 1 day, and the subject claims to have felt wonderful. No<br>
pain, discomfort, swelling or oozing. Life felt wonderful.<br>
Outbreak #9 July 24,2001 (5 months later)<br>
Subject had slight prodrome and some evidence of redness on his penis but very mild, unlike anything he has<br>
had before. Called Dr. Silverstone and picked up the device. The subject told him that the subject thought he was<br>
having an outbreak about one month ago but the feeling started and then just went away on its own.<br>
Summary<br>
Over a period of two years and nine months, the subject has had nine outbreaks. This number is less than<br>
the normal number of outbreaks that the subject has had over any similar period in the previous 23 years. Before<br>
using the device the subject would have probably had from 11 to 17 outbreaks in this past period of two years and<br>
nine months. The subject feels certain that it was using the device that cut down on the number of outbreaks.<br>
The subject used the drugs on two of the outbreaks because Dr. Silverstone was either not available, or the<br>
subject wanted to see what they would do for him. They really did not do much for the subject since the outbreaks<br>
slowed down when he took the pills, but became more severe when the pills finished. The first time the subject used<br>
the drug (Famvir), he had to take two courses since the first course did little, and when finished, the outbreak flared<br>
up. The second time the subject took Valtrex because his girlfriend has a supply for her oral herpes. This did not<br>
prove very satisfactory and the outbreak lasted the normal two-week plus period.<br>
On the other six outbreaks the subject used the device and the results were wonderful. Or. Silverstone told<br>
the subject that the ideal time to use the device is when the subject gets his prodrome, which with him is tingling in<br>
the thighs about a day before the outbreak starts. The subject has not been able to do this since he has to get in<br>
touch with the doctor after he has had his prodrome and then arrange to pick up the device. By this time, the<br>
outbreak has already started.<br>
When the subject uses the device, the outbreak appears to stop dead in its tracks. Lesions did not get<br>
bigger, did not increase in number, did not burst, and there was no pain or oozing of fluid. The whole episode including<br>
healing was over in 2-3 days instead of the normal two weeks plus. If they were all like this in the future, life would<br>
be good. The subject cannot wait to be able to buy the device, which he would carry with him so as to treat the<br>
disease immediately when the prodrome starts. The subject"s girlfriend wants to volunteer for the oral herpes device<br>
when it is available.<br>
Example 4 - Human Papiloma Virus<br>
A female subject, date of birth 6/21/51, had a history of lesions appearing on the lower part of her legs,<br>
generally on the front aspect between the knee and the ankle. An outbreak usually consisted of 2-3 to six or more<br>
lesions, and tended to occur during times of stress. The lesions would become larger over a period of five to seven<br>
days, and would dry up and disappear two to three weeks after their appearance. The lesions were diagnosed as<br>
being caused by Human Papiloma Virus, for which oral medication and topical cream was prescribed. These<br>
treatments were not successful.<br>
The subject then tried the electrical stimulation device of the present invention, using it directly on the<br>
lesions for ten 30 second treatments as described above in Examples 1 and 2. She treated each lesion separately,<br>
unless two were very close together, in which case the electrodes were placed between the two lesions.<br>
The subject reported that the pain subsided immediately, and that the lesions haaled and disappeared within<br>
three days.<br>
Example S - Verruca<br>
A male subject, date of birth 5128/49, developed a verruca wart on the sole of his right foot. The lesion was<br>
positioned at the front and in the center of the planter surface of the foot immediately to the side of the large toe<br>
prominence. It interfered with the subject"s walking and running. The subject had tried a number of treatments,<br>
including 40% salicylic acid pads, but these did not eliminate the wart or the associated pain and discomfort.<br>
The subject used the stimulation device described above for ten 30 second treatments as in Examples 1-3.<br>
After the ten treatments, the subject reported that the pain had stopped completely. The lesion was still visible as a<br>
raised area on the planter surface of the foot, and a second series of ten treatments was applied, commencing about<br>
one hour after the conclusion of the first series of ten treatments. By the end of the second course of treatment, the<br>
lesion appeared different in texture, was less swollen, and was not painful. The subject was advised to foot file the<br>
region, which he did, after which the affected area looked normal.<br>
Fallow up with the subject over nine months following treatment revealed that he was completely pain free,<br>
with no evidence that the verruca had returned.<br>
Thus, the method and device described herein were found to be effective in the treatment of viral infection.<br>
The treatment with the device not only improved recovery time, but indications are that it also reduced the frequency<br>
of recurrence.<br>
