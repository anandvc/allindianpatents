COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
"PHENYL-SUBSTITUTED 4-HYDROXY TETRAHYDROPYRIDONES AND THEIR PROCESS OF<br>
PREPARATION"<br>
BAYER AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT, a German company, of D-51368 Leverkusen, Germany,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br>
Le A 34 338-Foreien Countries Gam/by/NT <br>
Phenvl-substituted 4-hydroxy-"tetrahydropyridones<br>
The    present    invention    relates    to    novel    phenyl-substituted    4-hydroxy-<br>
5	tetrahydropyridones, to a plurality of processes for their preparation and to their use<br>
as pesticides and herbicides.<br>
It is known that certain tetrahydropyridones have herbicidal properties: JP 0832530.<br>
Moreover, specific 4-hydroxytetrahydropyridones having acaricidal, insecticidal and<br>
10	herbicidal properties are known: JP 11152273.<br>
However, the activity and activity spectrum of these compounds is, in particular at<br>
low   application   rates   and   concentrations,   not   always   entirely   satisfactory.<br>
Furthermore, the compatibility of these compounds with plants is not always<br>
15	sufficient.<br>
This invention, accordingly, provides novel compounds of the formula (I)<br>

Depending inter alia on the nature of the substituents, the compounds of the formula (I) can be present as geometrical and/or optical isomers or isomer mixtures in varying<br>
20	composition which, if appropriate, can be separated in a customary manner. The<br>
present invention provides both the pure isomers and the isomer mixtures, their preparation and use, and also compositions comprising them. However, hereinbelow, for the sake of simplicity, only compounds of the formula (I) are referred to, although this may mean both the pure compounds and, if appropriate, mixtures with varying<br>
25	contents of isomeric compounds.<br>
Depending on the location of the substituent G, the compounds of the formula (I) can be present in the two isomeric forms of the formulae (I-A) and (I-B),<br><br><br>
Le A 34 338-Foreign Countries<br><br>
which is meant to be indicated by the broken line in formula (I).<br>
The compounds of the formulae (I-A) and (I-B) can be present both as mixtures and<br>
5	in the form of their pure isomers. Mixtures of the compounds of the formulae (I-A)<br>
and (I-B) can, if appropriate, be separated in a manner known per se by physical methods, for example by chromatographic methods.<br>
For reasons of clarity, hereinbelow only one of the possible isomers is shown in each<br>
10	case. This does not exclude the fact that the compounds are, if appropriate, present in<br>
the form of the isomer mixtures or in the respective other isomeric form.<br>
Taking into account the different meanings (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (0 and (g) of group G, the following principal structures (I-a) to (I-g) result<br>

In the preparation process (I-P), approximately 1 mol of carbamoyl chloride of the formula (XV) is reacted per mole of starting material of the formula (I-a), at from -20 to 150°C, preferably at from 0 to 70°C. 5<br>
Suitable diluents which are added, if appropriate, are all inert polar organic solvents, such as nitriles, esters, ethers, amides, sulphones, sulphoxides or halogenated hydrocarbons.<br>
10	Preference is given to using acetonitrile, ethylene acetate, dimethyl sulphoxide,<br>
tetrahydrofuran, dimethylformamide or methylene chloride.<br>
If, in a preferred embodiment, the enolate salt of the compound (la) is prepared by<br>
addition of strong deprotonating agents (such as, for example, sodium hydride or<br>
15	potassium tert-butoxide), it is not necessary to add further acid binders.<br>
If acid binders are employed, these are customary inorganic or organic bases, for example sodium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, triethylamine or pyridine. 20<br>
The reaction can be carried out at atmospheric pressure or under elevated pressure and is preferably carried out at atmospheric pressure. Work-up is carried out by customary methods.<br>
25	The active compounds are suitable for controlling animal pests, in particular insects,<br>
arachnids and nematodes found in agriculture, in forests, in the protection of stored products and materials and in the hygiene sector, and they are tolerated well by plants and have favourable homeotherm toxicity. They are preferably employed as crop protection agents. They are active against normally sensitive and resistant species,<br>

They are used as aerosols, pressure-free spray products, for example pump and<br>
atomizer sprays, automatic fogging systems, foggers, foams, gels, evaporator<br>
products with evaporator tablets made of cellulose or polymer, liquid evaporators, gel<br>
5	and membrane evaporators, propeller-driven evaporators, energy-free, or passive,<br>
evaporation systems, moth papers, moth bags and moth gels, as granules or dusts, in baits for spreading or in bait stations.<br>
The active compounds according to the invention can be used as defoliants,<br>
10	desiccants, haulm killers and, especially, as weed killers. Weeds in the broadest sense<br>
are understood to mean all plants which grow in locations where they are undesired. Whether the substances according to the invention act as total or selective herbicides depends essentially on the amount used.<br>
15	The active compounds according to the invention can be used, for example, in<br>
connection with the following plants:<br>
Dicotyledonous weeds of the genera: Abutilon, Amarantnus, Ambrosia, Anoda, Anthemis, Aphanes, Atriplex, Bellis, Bidens, Capsella, Carduus, Cassia, Centaurea,<br>

However, the use of the active compounds according to the invention is in no way restricted to these genera, but also extends in the same manner to other plants.<br>
The active compounds according to the invention are suitable, depending on the<br>
15	concentration, for the total control of weeds, for example on industrial terrain and rail<br>
tracks, and on paths and areas with and without tree plantings. Similarly, the active<br>
compounds according to the invention can be employed for controlling weeds in<br>
perennial crops, for example forests, decorative tree plantings, orchards, vineyards,<br>
citrus groves, nut orchards, banana plantations, coffee plantations, tea plantations,<br>
20	rubber plantations, oil palm plantations, cocoa plantations, soft fruit plantings and<br>
hop fields, on lawns, turf and pastureland, and for the selective control of weeds in annual crops.<br>
The compounds according to the invention have strong herbicidal activity and a<br>
25	broad active spectrum when used on the soil and on above-ground parts of plants. To<br>
a certain extent they are also suitable for the selective control of monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous weeds in monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous crops, both by the pre-emergence and by the post-emergence method.<br>
30	At certain concentrations or application rates, the active compounds according to the<br>
invention can also be employed for controlling animal pests and fungal or bacterial<br><br><br>
Le A 34 338-Foreign Countries<br><br>
-86-<br>
plant diseases. If appropriate, they can also be used as intermediates or precursors tor the synthesis of other active compounds.<br>
All plants and plant parts can be treated in accordance with the invention. Plants are<br>
5	to be understood as meaning in the present context all plants and plant populations<br>
such as desired and undesired wild plants or crop plants (including naturally occurring crop plants). Crop plants can be plants which can be obtained by conventional plant breeding and optimization methods or by biotechnological and recombinant methods or by combinations of these methods, including the transgenic<br>
10	plants and inclusive of the plant varieties protectable or not protectable by plant<br>
breeders" rights. Plant parts are to be understood as meaning all parts and organs of plants above and below the ground, such as shoot, leaf, flower and root, examples which may be mentioned being leaves, needles, stalks, stems, flowers, fruit bodies, fruits, seeds, roots, tubers and rhizomes. The plant parts also include harvested<br>
15	material, and vegetative and generative propagation material, for example cuttings,<br>
tubers, rhizomes, offsets and seeds.<br>
Treatment according to the invention of the plants and plant parts with the active<br>
compounds is carried out directly or by allowing the compounds to act on the<br>
20	surroundings, environment or storage space by the customary treatment methods, for<br>
example by immersion, spraying, evaporation, fogging, scattering, painting on and, in the case of propagation material, in particular in the case of seeds, also by applying one or more coats.<br>
25	As already mentioned above, it is possible to treat all plants and their parts according<br>
to the invention. In a preferred embodiment, wild plant species and plant varieties, or those obtained by conventional biological breeding, such as crossing or protoplast fusion, and parts thereof, are treated. In a further preferred embodiment, transgenic plants and plant varieties obtained by geneticaJ  engineering, if appropriate in<br>
30	combination with conventional methods (Genetically Modified Organisms), and parts<br><br><br>
Le A 34 338-Foreign Countries<br>
-87-<br>
thereof are treated. The term "parts" or "parts of plants" or "plant parts" has been explained above.<br>
Particularly preferably, plants of the plant varieties which are in each case<br>
5	commercially available or in use are treated according to the invention. Plant<br>
varieties are to be understood as meaning plants having certain properties ("traits") and which have been obtained by conventional breeding, by mutagenesis or by recombinant DNA techniques. They can be varieties, bio- or genotypes.<br>
10	Depending on the plant species or plant varieties, their location and growth<br>
conditions (soils, climate, vegetation period, diet), the treatment according to the invention may also result in superadditive ("synergistic") effects. Thus, for example, reduced application rates and/or a widening of the activity spectrum and/or an increase in the activity of the substances and compositions to be used according to<br>
15	the invention, better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures,<br>
increased tolerance to drought or to water or soil salt content, increased flowering performance, easier harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvest yields, better quality and/or a higher nutritional value of the harvested products, better storage stability and/or processability of the harvested products are possible which exceed the<br>
20	effects which were actually to be expected.<br>
The transgenic plants or plant varieties (i.e. those obtained by genetical engineering) which are preferably treated according to the invention include all plants which, in the genetic modification, received genetic material which imparted particularly<br>
25	advantageous useful properties ("traits") to these plants. Examples of such properties<br>
are better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures, increased tolerance to drought or to water or soil salt content, increased flowering performance, easier harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvest yields, better quality and/or a higher nutritional value of the harvested products, better storage stability and/or<br>
30	processability  of the  harvested  products.  Further  and  particularly emphasized<br>
examples of such properties are a better defence of the plants against animal and<br><br>
Le A 34 338-Foreign Countries<br>
-88-<br>
microbial pests, such as against insects, mites, phytopathogenic fungi, bacteria and/or<br>
viruses, and also increased tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidally active<br>
compounds. Examples of transgenic plants which may be mentioned are the<br>
important crop plants, such as cereals (wheat, rice), maize, soya beans, potatoes,<br>
5	cotton, oilseed rape and also fruit plants (with the fruits apples, pears, citrus fruits<br>
and grapes), and particular emphasis is given to maize, soya beans, potatoes, cotton and oilseed rape. Traits that are emphasized are in particular increased defence of the plants against insects by toxins formed in the plants, in particular those formed in the plants by the genetic material from Bacillus thuringiensis (for example by the genes<br>
10	CrylA(a), CrylA(b), CrylA(c), CryllA, CrymA, CryIIIB2, Cry9c Cry2Ab, Cry3Bb<br>
and CrylF and also combinations thereof) (hereinbelow referred to as "Bt plants"). Traits that are also particularly emphasized are the increased defence of the plants to fungi, bacteria and viruses by systemic acquired resistance (SAR), systemin, phytoalexins, elicitors and resistance genes and correspondingly expressed proteins<br>
15	and toxins. Traits that are furthermore particularly emphasized are the increased<br>
tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidally active compounds, for example imidazolinones, sulphonylureas, glyphosate or phosphinotricin (for example the "PAT" gene). The genes which impart the desired traits in question can also be present in combination with one another in the transgenic plants. Examples of "Bt<br>
20	plants" which may be mentioned are maize varieties, cotton varieties, soya bean<br>
varieties and potato varieties which are sold under the trade names YIELD GARD® (for example maize, cotton, soya beans), KnockOut® (for example maize), StarLink® (for example maize), Bollgard® (cotton), Nucotn® (cotton) and NewLeaf® (potato). Examples of herbicide-tolerant plants which may be mentioned<br>
25	are maize varieties, cotton varieties and soya bean varieties which are sold under the<br>
trade names Roundup Ready® (tolerance to glyphosate, for example maize, cotton, soya bean), Liberty Link® (tolerance to phosphinotricin, for example oilseed rape), EMI® (tolerance to imidazolinones) and STS® (tolerance to sulphonylurea, for example maize). Herbicide-resistant plants (plants bred in a conventional manner for<br>
30	herbicide tolerance) which may be mentioned include the varieties sold under the<br>
name Clearfield® (for example maize). Of course, these statements also apply to<br><br><br>
Le A 34 338-Foreign Countries<br>
-89-<br>
plant varieties having these genetic traits or genetic traits still to be developed, which plants will be developed and/or marketed in the future.<br>
The plants listed can be treated according to the invention in a particularly<br>
5	advantageous manner with the compounds of the formula (I). The preferred ranges<br>
stated above for the active compounds also apply to the treatment of these plants. Particular emphasis is given to the treatment of plants with the mixtures specifically mentioned in the present text.<br>
10	The active compounds can be converted into the customary formulations such as<br>
solutions, emulsions, wettable powders, suspensions, powders, dusts, pastes, soluble powders, granules, suspension-emulsion concentrates, natural and synthetic materials impregnated with active compound, and microencapsulations in polymeric materials.<br>
15	These formulations are produced in a known manner, for example by mixing the<br>
active compounds with extenders, that is, liquid solvents and/or solid carriers, optionally with the use of surfactants, that is, emulsifiers and/or dispersants, and/or foam formers.<br>
20	If the extender used is water, it is also possible, for example, to use organic solvents<br>
as cosolvents. The following are essentially suitable as liquid solvents: aromatics such as xylene, toluene or alkylnaphthalenes, chlorinated aromatics or chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons such as chlorobenzenes, chloroethylenes or methylene chloride, aliphatic hydrocarbons such as cyclohexane or paraffins, for example<br>
25	mineral oil fractions, mineral and vegetable oils, alcohols such as butanol or glycol<br>
and their ethers and esters, ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone or cyclohexanone, strongly polar solvents such as dimethylformamide and dimethyl sulphoxide, or else water.<br>
30	Suitable solid carriers are: for example ammonium salts and ground natural minerals<br>
such   as   kaolins,   clays,   talc,   chalk,   quartz,   attapulgite,   montmorillonite   or<br><br><br>

diatomaceous earth, and ground synthetic materials such as highly-disperse silica,<br>
alumina and silicates; suitable solid carriers for granules are: for example crushed<br>
and fractionated natural rocks such as calcite, marble, pumice, sepiolite and dolomite,<br>
or else synthetic granules of inorganic and organic meals, and granules of organic<br>
5	material such as sawdust, coconut shells, maize cobs and tobacco stalks; suitable<br>
emulsifiers and/or foam formers are: for example nonionic and anionic emulsifiers<br>
such as polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene fatty alcohol ethers, for<br>
example alkylaryl polyglycol ethers, alkylsulphonates, .alkyl sulphates,<br>
arylsulphonates, or else protein hydrolysates; suitable dispersants are: for example<br>
10	lignin-sulphite waste liquors and methylcellulose.<br>
Tackifiers such as carboxymethylcellulose and natural and synthetic polymers in the<br>
form of powders, granules or latices, such as gum arabic, polyvinyl alcohol and<br>
polyvinyl acetate, or else natural phospholipids such as cephalins and lecithins and<br>
15	synthetic phospholipids can be used in the formulations. Other additives can be<br>
mineral and vegetable oils.<br>
It is possible to use colorants such as inorganic pigments, for example iron oxide,<br>
titanium oxide and Prussian Blue, and organic colorants such alizarin colorants, azo<br>
20	colorants and metal phthalocyanine colorants, and trace nutrients such as salts of<br>
iron, manganese, boron, copper, cobalt, molybdenum and zinc.<br>
The formulations generally comprise between 0.1 and 95% by weight of active compound, preferably between 0.5 and 90%.<br>
25<br>
For controlling weeds, the active compounds according to the invention, as such or in their formulations, can also be used as mixtures with known herbicides and/or substances which improve the compatibility with crop plants ("safeners"), finished formulations or tank mixes being possible. Also possible are mixtures with weed-<br>
