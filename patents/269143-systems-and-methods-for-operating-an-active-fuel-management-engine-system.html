				<td>FAST ACTIVE FUEL MANAGEMENT REACTIVATION<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional<br>
Application No. 60/956,449, filed on August 17, 2007. The disclosure of the<br>
above application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
FIELD<br>
[0002] The present invention relates to internal combustion engines<br>
and more particularly to methods and systems for operating an active fuel<br>
management engine system.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
[0004] Internal combustion engines may include engine control<br>
systems that deactivate cylinders under specific low load operating conditions.<br>
For example, an eight cylinder engine may be operated using four cylinders to<br>
improve fuel economy by reducing pumping losses. This process is generally<br>
referred to as active fuel management (AFM). Operation using all of the engine<br>
cylinders is referred to as an "activated" mode. Conversely, operation using less<br>
than all of the cylinders of the engine (i.e. one or more cylinders are not active) is<br>
referred to as a "deactivated" mode.<br><br>
[0005] In the deactivated mode, there are fewer firing cylinders. As a<br>
result, there is less drive torque available to drive the vehicle driveline and<br>
accessories (e.g., an alternator, coolant pump, and A/C compressor). However,<br>
the active cylinders operate at a higher efficiency due to reduced pumping losses<br>
and achieve better thermal and mechanical efficiency.<br>
[0006] A lifter oil manifold assembly (LOMA) is implemented to activate<br>
and deactivate selected cylinders of the engine. The LOMA includes electrically<br>
operated solenoid valves associated with respective cylinders. The solenoids<br>
are selectively energized to enable hydraulic fluid flow to the lifters to inhibit valve<br>
lifter operation, thereby deactivating the corresponding cylinders.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0007] An engine control module includes a valve control module that<br>
disables intake and exhaust valves corresponding to a cylinder that includes a<br>
mass of intake air. An engine cycle module determines a number of engine<br>
cycles that occured while the cylinder is disabled. An air estimation module<br>
determines a remaining mass of air in the cylinder based on the number of<br>
engine cycles.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0014] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is<br>
not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses. It should be<br>
understood that throughout the drawings, corresponding reference numerals<br>
indicate like or corresponding parts and features. As used herein, the term<br>
module refers to an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), an electronic<br>
circuit, a processor (shared, dedicated, or group) and memory that executes one<br>
or more software or firmware programs, a combinational logic circuit, and/or<br>
other suitable components that provide the described functionality.<br><br>
[0015] Two exemplary control strategies for active fuel management<br>
(AFM) in port fuel injection engines are: 1) to trap a fresh air/fuel mixture, and 2)<br>
to trap a burned charge. Trapping a fresh air/fuel mixture may result in<br>
unpredictable combustion of the air/fuel mixture, fuel migration into the lubrication<br>
oil, and oil film degradation at the cylinder wall.<br>
[0016] Referring to FIG. 1, a deactivated cylinder may exhibit large<br>
negative torque during a transition from an activated mode to a deactivated mode<br>
when trapping a burned exhaust charge, as indicated at 18. The large negative<br>
torque occurs because the trapped burned exhaust charge is at high pressure.<br>
When all of the selected cylinders are deactivated, expanding and compressing<br>
cylinders oppose each other and the negative torque is reduced. The high<br>
pressure eventually reduces as the cylinder cools and the exhaust gas escapes.<br>
The large torque oscillations due to the deactivated cylinders (1, 7, 6 &amp; 4)<br>
gradually decay to a steady value after a number of engine cycles (e.g. 10<br>
engine cycles).<br>
[0017] A fast active fuel management (AFM) reactivation system may<br>
be used to eliminate the large negative torque resulting from the compression of<br>
hot exhaust gas. The system may involve trapping an air charge in a direct<br>
injection engine. The trapped air charge produces less negative torque than<br>
compression of hot exhaust gas. The trapped air may be mixed with fuel and<br>
ignited to quickly activate the deactivated cylinders.<br>
[0018] Referring now to FIG. 2, an AFM engine system 20 includes an<br>
engine 22 that combusts an air/fuel mixture to produce drive torque. Air is drawn<br><br>
into an intake manifold 24 through a throttle 26. The throttle 26 regulates air flow<br>
into the intake manifold 24. Air within the intake manifold 24 may be distributed<br>
into cylinders 28. One or more selected cylinders 28' may be selectively<br>
deactivated during engine operation. Although FIG. 2 depicts eight cylinders, it is<br>
appreciated that the engine 22 may include additional or fewer cylinders 28. For<br>
example, engines having 4, 5, 6,10,12 and 16 cylinders are contemplated.<br>
[0019] The engine 22 includes a lifter oil manifold assembly (LOMA) 30<br>
that deactivates the selected cylinders 28'. For example only, half of the<br>
cylinders are deactivated when the engine enters the deactivated mode, although<br>
any number of cylinders may be deactivated. Upon deactivation of the selected<br>
cylinders 28', the inlet and exhaust valves of the deactivated cylinders 28' are<br>
closed to reduce pumping losses.<br>
[0020] The engine system 20 includes an engine control module 32<br>
that communicates with components of the engine system 20, such as the<br>
engine 22 and associated sensors and controls as discussed herein. The engine<br>
control module 32 may implement the fast AFM reactivation system of the<br>
present disclosure.<br>
[0021] Air is passed from an inlet 34 through a mass airflow sensor 36,<br>
such as a mass airflow meter. The sensor 36 generates a mass airflow (MAF)<br>
signal that indicates a rate of air flowing through the sensor 36. The inlet air is<br>
metered to the engine 22 via the throttle 26. For example only, the throttle 26<br>
may be a conventional butterfly valve that rotates within the inlet air path 34. The<br>
throttle 26 is adjusted based on an operator and/or controller commanded engine<br><br>
operating point. The position of the throttle 26 is sensed by a throttle position<br>
sensor 38 that generates a throttle position (TPS) signal. The throttle position<br>
sensor 38 may be a rotational potentiometer.<br>
[0022] A manifold pressure sensor 40 is positioned in the engine intake<br>
manifold 24 between the throttle 26 and the engine 22. The manifold pressure<br>
sensor 40 generates a manifold absolute air pressure (MAP) signal. A manifold<br>
air temperature sensor 42, that generates a manifold air temperature (MAT)<br>
signal based on intake air temperature, may also be located in the engine intake<br>
manifold 24.<br>
[0023] An engine crankshaft (not shown) rotates at engine speed or a<br>
rate that is proportional to the engine speed. A crankshaft sensor 44 senses the<br>
position of the crankshaft and generates a crankshaft position (CSP) signal. The<br>
CSP signal may be related to the rotational speed of the crankshaft and cylinder<br>
events. The crankshaft sensor 44 may be a conventional variable reluctance<br>
sensor. Skilled artisans will appreciate that there are other suitable methods of<br>
sensing engine speed and cylinder events.<br>
[0024] The engine control module 32 electronically controls a fuel<br>
injector 46 to inject fuel into one of the cylinders 28. An intake valve 48<br>
selectively opens and closes to enable air to enter the cylinder 28. Intake valve<br>
position is regulated by a camshaft (not shown) that communicates with the<br>
LOMA 30. A piston (not shown) compresses the air/fuel mixture within the<br>
cylinder 28. The engine control module 32 controls a spark plug 50 to initiate<br>
combustion of the air/fuel mixture, driving the piston in the cylinder 28. The<br><br>
piston drives a crankshaft (not shown) to produce drive torque. Combustion<br>
exhaust within the cylinder 28 is forced out through an exhaust manifold (not<br>
shown) when an exhaust valve 52 is in an open position. A camshaft (not<br>
shown) regulates exhaust valve position. Although single intake and exhaust<br>
valves 48,52 are illustrated, it can be appreciated that the engine 22 may include<br>
multiple intake and exhaust valves 48,52 per cylinder 28.<br>
[0025] Referring to FIG. 3, the engine control module 32 includes a<br>
valve control module 66, an engine cycle module 68, and an air estimation<br>
module 70. The engine control module 32 receives input signals from the engine<br>
system 20 including, but not limited to, the MAF, TPS, MAP, MAT and CSP<br>
signals (hereinafter, "engine system signals"). The engine control module 32<br>
processes the engine system signals and generates timed engine control<br>
commands that are output to the engine system 20. For example, engine control<br>
commands may include signals that control the spark plugs 50, fuel injectors 46,<br>
throttle 26, and LOMA 30.<br>
[0026] The engine control module 32 disables the fuel injectors 46 and<br>
spark plugs 50 to the selected inactive cylinders 28' when the engine reaches a<br>
suitable operating point for deactivation. For example only, a suitable operating<br>
point for deactivation may be during light load operating conditions (e.g. when<br>
there is sufficient reserve torque available in the deactivated mode).<br>
[0027] The valve control module 66 uses engine system signals (e.g. a<br>
CSP signal) to determine when the selected cylinders 28' are filled with air. The<br>
valve control module 66 may determine that the selected cylinders are filled with<br><br>
air during an intake cycle, or upon completion of an intake cycle for the selected<br>
cylinder. The valve control module 66 disables the intake and exhaust valves<br>
48,52 such that the selected cylinders 28' are filled with intake air. The valve<br>
control module may send engine control commands to the LOMA 30 to disable<br>
the intake and exhaust valves 48,52.<br>
[0028] The engine control module 32 may observe inlet airflow rate<br>
characterized by MAF signals to estimate a mass of air in each of the selected<br>
cylinders 28'. The engine control module 32 may estimate the mass of air based<br>
on MAP signals and potential transient conditions as a result of cylinder<br>
deactivation. The engine control module 32 may store a plurality of estimated air<br>
mass values determined immediately after deactivation.<br>
[0029] The engine cycle module 68 logs the number of engine cycles<br>
that pass after the selected cylinders 28' are filled with air and deactivated.<br>
Engine cycles may be determined based on engine system signals (e.g. CSP<br>
signals) and an internal counter of the engine cycle module 68. Upon<br>
reactivation, the engine cycle module 68 outputs engine cycle data to the air<br>
estimation module 70.<br>
[0030] The air estimation module 70 uses engine cycle data to<br>
calculate the percentage of air mass remaining in the selected cylinders 28' since<br>
deactivation. The air mass percentage may be calculated based on a lookup<br>
table relating the number of engine cycles after deactivation to cylinder air mass<br>
percentage. The air estimation module 70 may store the lookup table. The air<br>
estimation module 70 may calculate the air mass percentage by using state<br><br>
estimators, algebraic equations, differential equations, integral equations, and/or<br>
other similar calculations.<br>
[0031] The air estimation module 70 estimates an air mass remaining<br>
in each of the selected cylinders 28' (hereinafter, "post cycle air mass") based on<br>
the air mass percentage and the plurality of estimated air mass values. The air<br>
estimation module 70 may multiply the air mass percentage by the plurality of<br>
estimated air mass values to determine the post cycle air mass.<br>
[0032] The engine control module 32 calculates the amount of fuel<br>
required for each deactivated cylinder 28' for efficient combustion based on the<br>
post cycle air mass estimation. The engine control module 32 enables the fuel<br>
injectors 46 and spark plugs 50 to the selected cylinders 28', along with the<br>
intake and exhaust valves 48,52. The post cycle air mass and fuel mixture are<br>
burned prior to exhaust to provide a faster torque increase and an oxygen<br>
balanced exhaust stream for a catalytic converter (not shown).<br>
[0033] Referring to FIG. 4, a fast AFM reactivation method 72 starts in<br>
step 74. In step 76, the engine control module 32 determines whether the engine<br>
22 has entered an operating point suitable for deactivation. If false, the method<br>
repeats step 76. If true, the method continues to step 77. In step 77, the engine<br>
control module 32 disables the fuel injectors 46 and spark plugs 50 to the<br>
selected cylinders 28'. In step 78, the valve control module 66 determines<br>
whether fresh air has entered the selected cylinders 28'. If false, the method<br>
repeats step 78. If true, the method continues to step 80. In step 80, the valve<br>
control module 66 disables intake and exhaust valves such that the selected<br><br>
cylinders 28' are filled with intake air. In step 82, the engine control module 32<br>
estimates the mass of air in each selected cylinder and stores air mass estimates<br>
for the selected cylinders 28'. In step 84, the engine cycle module 68 starts a<br>
deactivation mode engine cycle counter. In step 85, the engine control module<br>
32 determines whether the engine 22 has entered an operating point suitable for<br>
reactivation. If false, the method repeats step 85. If true, the method continues<br>
to step 86. In step 86, the engine cycle modufe 68 reads the number of engine<br>
cycles since deactivation. In step 88, the air estimation module 70 reads the<br>
percentage of air mass remaining in the selected cylinders 28' from a lookup<br>
table relating the number of engine cycles to the percentage of cylinder air mass.<br>
In step 90, the air estimation module 70 estimates the remaining air mass in each<br>
selected cylinder 28' by multiplying the air mass estimates by the percentage of<br>
air mass remaining in the selected cylinders 28'. In step 92, the engine control<br>
module 32 commands the appropriate amount of fuel for each selected cylinder<br>
28' based on the remaining air mass estimation, in step 94, the engine control<br>
module 32 enables the fuel injectors 46 and spark plugs 50 to the selected<br>
cylinders 28'. In step 96, the engine control module 32 enables the intake and<br>
exhaust valves for each selected cylinder 28'. The fast AFM reactivation method<br>
72 ends in step 98.<br>
[0034] Referring to FIG. 5, the fast AFM reactivation system may<br>
eliminate the high negative torque excursions present in the port fuel injection<br>
control strategy, as indicated at 100. Consequently, the fast AFM system may<br>
allow for noise, vibration, and harness improvement.<br><br>
