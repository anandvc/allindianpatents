				<td>SPECIFICATION<br>
CYLINDER HEAD<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a cylinder head that enables for a high engine<br>
thermal efficiency to be maintained while keeping NOx levels low with improving the<br>
combustion performance of a lean burn gas engine.<br>
2. Description of the Related Art<br>
In an internal combustion engine such as a gas engine or the like, a seat ring is<br>
mounted on an aperture of an intake port that communicates with a combustion chamber,<br>
and there is provided a seat surface that is in contact with an intake valve that opens and<br>
closes this aperture.<br>
An example of the configuration of a conventional seat ring is shown in FIG. 11.<br>
This seat ring (referred to below as a standard seat ring) has an annular configuration and<br>
the inner diameter ? A is concentric with the outer diameter F. Namely, the inner<br>
diameter ? A and the outer diameter F have the same center a.<br>
In a gas engine the combustion of a fuel-air mixture of fuel gas and air is carried out<br>
by flame propagation. Accordingly, the active use of an air flow provides an<br>
improvement in thermal efficiency by shortening the combustion period.<br>
However, because the inner diameter ? A is concentric with the outer diameter F in<br>
a standard seat ring, in a gas engine fitted with a standard seat ring the swirl ratio is small<br>
and it is difficult to improve the performance of a combustion that makes use of air flow.<br>
Furthermore, the latest diesel engines are designed such that a relatively high output<br>
can be obtained in proportion to the size of the engine. Namely, it is required that the<br>
engine is a high brake mean effective pressure (BMEP) engine. Consequently, in order<br>
to secure the necessary quantity of air for combustion to proceed, there is a tendency to<br>
employ a high pressure ratio type of supercharger, and to design the intake and exhaust<br>
ports of the cylinder head with a large cross-sectional area and with a configuration that<br><br>
has few bends and the like. In ports with this type of configuration the flow coefficient is<br>
high but a strong swirl flow is not generated.<br>
In contrast, a pilot oil ignition gas engine has been developed that aims to<br>
provide cleaner exhaust through perfect combustion, a high output, and a high thermal<br>
efficiency. This pilot oil ignition gas engine aims to keep production costs in check by<br>
using the same principal components as those used in a diesel engine.<br>
Because a cylinder head of this pilot oil ignition gas engine is the same as that<br>
used in a diesel engine, it has a high flow coefficient ; however, the swirl ratio is zero<br>
and no improvement in the combustion performance by making use of air flow can be<br>
expected.<br>
Accordingly, in the development of this pilot oil ignition gas engine, the<br>
suppression of the flow coefficient to a minimum at the same time as the swirl ratio is<br>
improved is desired in order to improve thermal efficiency.<br>
The present invention was conceived in view of the above circumstances and it is<br>
an object thereof to provide a cylinder head that enables the conflicting elements of the<br>
flow coefficient being maintained as well as the swirl ratio being strengthened to both be<br>
achieved, and to thereby obtain an improvement in thermal efficiency.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Next, a detailed description will be given of an apparatus to solve the above<br>
described problems.<br>
The present invention provides a cylinder head in which seat rings, against which<br>
are placed intake valves, are mounted respectively on a plurality of intake ports that<br>
communicate with a combustion chamber of an internal combustion engine, wherein,<br><br>
among the plurality of intake ports, an intake port on which is mounted an<br>
eccentric seat ring, with a center of an inner diameter of said eccentric seat ring being<br>
eccentric relative to a center of an outer diameter of said eccentric seat ring, is present<br>
together with an intake port on which is mounted a standard seat ring, with a center of<br>
an inner diameter of said standard seat ring matching a center of an outer diameter of<br>
said standard seat ring ; and<br>
two of the intake ports are aligned in a direction from an intake manifold side<br>
towards an opposite side sandwiching the cylinder head, and the standard seat ring is<br>
mounted on one of the intake ports while the eccentric seat ring is mounted on the other<br>
intake port;<br>
characterized in that the eccentric seat ring is mounted on the intake port at a<br>
relatively distant position as seen from the intake manifold side.<br>
In this cylinder head, as a result of an intake port on which is mounted an<br>
eccentric seat ring being present together with an intake port on which is mounted a<br>
standard seat ring, the flow coefficient is secured by the intake port on which is mounted<br>
the standard seat ring, while the swirl flow is strengthened by the intake port on which is<br>
mounted the eccentric seat ring. Therefore, it is possible to obtain the two conflicting<br>
elements of a secure flow coefficient and a strengthened swirl flow and then a higher<br>
thermal efficiency is obtained compared with when only the standard seat rings are<br>
mounted or with when only the eccentric seat ring is mounted.<br>
As a specific example, it is possible to employ a structure in which the camshaft<br>
goes from the intake manifold side towards the other side across the cylinder head, and<br>
two intake ports are positioned between the camshaft side and the intake manifold side<br>
of the cylinder head, and in which the standard seat ring is mounted on one of the intake<br>
ports while the eccentric seat ring is mounted on the other intake port.<br><br>
In this cylinder head, in a structure in which two intake ports are provided<br>
namely, in a structure provided with the minimum number of intake ports needed to<br>
implement the present invention, the standard seat rings are mounted on one of the<br>
intake ports while the eccentric seat rings are mounted on the other intake port. As a<br>
result, it is possible to obtain the two conflicting elements of a secure flow coefficient<br>
and a strengthened swirl flow even when two intake ports are provided, and a higher<br>
thermal efficiency is obtained compared with when only the standard seat ring is<br>
mounted on these two intake ports or with when only the eccentric seat ring is mounted<br>
thereon.<br>
By doing this it becomes possible to generate an effective swirl flow using the<br>
wall surface of the cylinder liner at a relatively distant position as seen from the intake<br>
manifold side.<br>
In this case, it is still more desirable that two exhaust ports are provided in the<br>
cylinder head in parallel with the two intake ports, and a narrow portion of an edge of the<br>
eccentric seat ring faces the exhaust port side at an angle of approximately 45° relative<br>
to a direction heading from the manifold side towards the camshaft side.<br>
In this cylinder head, by mounting the eccentric seat ring on the intake port at a<br>
relatively distant position as seen from the intake manifold side, and by facing a narrow<br>
portion of the edge of the eccentric seat ring towards the exhaust port side at an angle<br>
of approximately 45° relative to a direction heading from the manifold side towards the<br>
camshaft side, it is possible to effectively use the wall surface of the cylinder liner, and<br>
to generate an effective swirl flow in the combustion chamber.<br><br>
Moreover, because the direction of the intake entry is along the wall surface of<br>
the cylinder liner and is also a direction that results in little interference with the intake,,<br>
from the intake port where the standard seat ring is mounted, the swirl flow can be<br>
strengthened and the flow coefficient can be secured.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Preferred embodiments of the cylinder head according to the present invention will<br>
now be described with reference to the drawings.<br><br>
The present invention selects an appropriate eccentric direction and mounting<br>
position for a seat ring of an intake port that is mounted on a cylinder head of a gas engine,<br>
strengthens the swirl flow without reducing the flow coefficient, and improves the<br>
combustion performance by accelerating air flow during combustion. The present<br>
invention can be appropriately used in engines in which the combustion of a fuel-air<br>
mixture is performed by flame propagation, namely, pilot oil ignition engines, spark<br>
ignition gas engines, spark ignition gasoline engines, and the like. Engines that employ<br>
the technology of the present invention may also be used, for example, in stationary types<br>
of power generation installations for industrial or public use.<br>
FIG. 1 is a cross-sectional view of a seat ring (referred to below as an eccentric seat<br>
ring) used in the cylinder head according to the present invention. FIG. 2 is a plan view<br>
of the eccentric seat ring shown in FIG. 1.<br>
The eccentric seat ring 1 shown in FIG. 1 is mounted on an aperture of an intake<br>
port that opens into a cylinder head. The eccentric seat ring 1 is formed by an entry<br>
aperture portion 5 having a hole portion 3 that opens onto the side of the intake port, a<br>
valve seat portion 9 having a seat surface 7 that is provided on the side of a combustion<br>
chamber and that is in contact with an intake valve, a fitting portion 11 used when the<br>
eccentric seat ring 1 is mounted on the aperture of the cylinder head, and the like.<br>
In the eccentric seat ring 1, the center of the outer diameter thereof does not match<br>
the center of the inner diameter of the hole portion 3. Namely, in the eccentric seat ring<br>
1, the center of the inner diameter of the hole portion 3 deviates from the center of the<br>
outer diameter. Specifically, the circumferential surface of an inner diameter ? B<br>
having a center b that deviates by a distance E from the center a of the outer diameter<br>
forms an inner circumferential surface of the hole portion 3. Here, a direction from the<br>
center a of the outer diameter towards the center b of the inner diameter is called the<br>
eccentric direction of the eccentric seat ring 1.<br>
In order to obtain this type of eccentric hole portion 3, after forming the<br>
circumferential surface of the inner diameter ? A having a center a that is identical to that<br>
of the outer diameter, the circumferential surface of the inner diameter ? B is formed by<br>
cutting the first formed circumferential surface. As a result, as is shown in FIG. 1,<br><br>
portions of the inner circumferential surface of the hole portion 3 that are on the opposite<br>
side from the eccentric direction of the eccentric seat ring 1 are in contact with a convex<br>
circumferential surface 3a resulting when the circumferential surface of the inner diameter<br>
? A is formed, however, the remaining portions form a flat circumferential surface 3b that<br>
gradually widens upwards and downwards as it heads in the eccentric direction of the<br>
eccentric seat ring 1. The vertical width of the flat circumferential surface 3b is greatest<br>
on the eccentric direction side of the eccentric seat ring 1 (i.e., on the left side in FIG. 1).<br>
In contrast, in addition to the eccentric seat ring 1, the standard seat ring shown in<br>
FIG. 11 is mounted on the aperture of the intake port with the center a of the outer<br>
diameter thereof matching the inner diameter ? A of the hole portion 3. In this standard<br>
seat ring the outer diameter thereof is concentric with the hole portion 3.<br>
Namely, in the cylinder head according to the present embodiment, an intake port<br>
fitted with the eccentric seat ring 1 is present together with an intake port fitted with a<br>
standard seat ring.<br>
In the present embodiment, by optimally selecting the mounting position and<br>
eccentric direction of the eccentric seat ring 1 and the standard seat ring, it is possible to<br>
obtain the conflicting elements of both a secure flow coefficient and a strengthened swirl<br>
flow. An example of this is described below with reference to FIGS. 3 through 7.<br>
FIGS. 3A to 7C are typical plan views showing cylinder heads. These cylinder<br>
heads have two apertures each, the apertures A and B and the apertures C and D for each<br>
single cylinder. In addition, in these drawings, the left side is the camshaft side and the<br>
right side is the manifold side (both the intake manifold and the exhaust manifold are on<br>
the same side).<br>
In this cylinder head, one end of the two intake ports 13 and 14 shown by the broken<br>
line in FIG. 3A communicates with a combustion chamber via the apertures A and B.<br>
These apertures A and B are both opened and closed by intake valves (not shown).<br>
Although omitted from the drawings, the other end of the intake ports 13 and 14 are<br>
connected to each other so as to be in an upstream/ downstream relationship relative to the<br>
intake flow.<br>
Furthermore, the apertures A and B are positioned such that a line segment passing<br><br>
through the centers of both apertures A and B extends from the manifold side towards the<br>
opposite side (the camshaft side in the examples in the drawings) with the cylinder head in<br>
between.<br>
The apertures C and D of the exhaust ports (not shown) that communicate with the<br>
combustion chamber are placed parallel with the respective apertures A and B of the<br>
intake ports 13 and 14. The apertures C and D are both opened and closed by exhaust<br>
valves (not shown).<br>
Next, the results obtained when the flow coefficients and swirl flow strengths were<br>
compared in the cylinder heads shown in FIGS. 3A to 7C using a steady flow test<br>
apparatus employing an impeller will be explained with reference to FIGS. 3A to 8.<br>
The total of 15 diagrams shown in FIGS. 3A to 7C show combinations of eccentric<br>
directions of eccentric seat rings and positions of standard seat rings and eccentric seat<br>
rings mounted on the respective apertures A to D in the steady flow test apparatus. Note<br>
that, in FIGS. 3A to 7C, the centers of the outer diameter of the eccentric seat rings match<br>
the centers of the apertures on which those eccentric seat rings are mounted. Moreover,<br>
in FIGS. 3A to 7C, the arrow d indicates the eccentric direction of the eccentric seat rings.<br>
For the flow coefficient and swirl flow, a flow coefficient of 0.51 and a<br>
dimensionless swirl number of 0.134, which are approximately the same as those of a<br>
conventional gas engine, were targeted.<br>
These target values were employed for the following reasons. Namely, in a<br>
conventional gas engine, because the output per unit of cylinder volume is low (a small<br>
output of less than 1.23 MPa (when expressed using BMEP), and less than 1.47 MPa even<br>
at its largest), a large quantity of air for combustion is not required. When designing an<br>
intake port for the cylinder head in this type of conventional gas engine, the conflicting<br>
elements of flow coefficient and swirl flow can be set at appropriate values without any<br>
special technologies needing to be used. However, for the purposes of pursuing<br>
economic efficiency by reducing initial costs and achieving a reduction in running costs<br>
by increasing the power generating efficiency of the engine and the like, if the output per<br>
unit of cylinder volume is increased to a high output of 1.47 MPa (using BMEP) or more,<br>
or desirably of 1.72 MPa or more, or still more desirably of 1.96 MPa or more, then<br><br>
because a greater quantity of air is required than is the case conventionally, designing the<br>
intake ports with priority given to the flow coefficient is unavoidable.<br>
In contrast, it is necessary to make the swirl flow an appropriate value such that<br>
flame propagation of the fuel-air mixture that uses an ignition source inside a cylinder of<br>
the gas engine as a start point is accelerated and reliable burning of the fuel-air mixture is<br>
ensured. However, normally, when the output per unit of cylinder volume is increased, if<br>
the flow coefficient is secured in the same manner as for a conventional gas engine, it is<br>
not possible for the swirl flow to have the same strength that it has in a conventional gas<br>
engine.<br>
Accordingly, in the present embodiment, a flow coefficient of 0.51 and a<br>
dimensionless swirl number of 0.134, which are approximately the same as in a<br>
conventional gas engine, were targeted in order to maintain these conflicting elements of<br>
flow coefficient and swirl flow even in a high output engine. In other words, the present<br>
embodiment obtains a higher output per cylinder than is obtained conventionally, achieves<br>
a reduction in initial costs and a reduction in running costs through improved engine<br>
power generating efficiency, and improves the economic efficiency of the engine by<br>
maintaining approximately the same flow coefficient and dimensionless swirl number as<br>
those obtained in a conventional gas engine by using a combination of a standard seat ring<br>
and an eccentric seat ring. Furthermore, even if the present embodiment is used in an<br>
engine with a BMEP of less than 1.23 MPa, an improvement in the thermal efficiency to<br>
match the strengthened swirl flow is possible.<br>
FIG. 8 shows the flow coefficient and dimensionless swirl number when the valve<br>
lift is at maximum in the various combinations of seat rings shown in FIGS. 3A to 7C.<br>
Note that the + or - of the dimensionless swirl number on the vertical axis in FIG. 8<br>
indicates the direction of the swirl flow and, as is shown in FIG. 3A, as seen from the<br>
explosion surface of the cylinder head, the anticlockwise direction is +, while the<br>
clockwise direction is -.<br>
As is shown in FIG. 3A (seat ring combination No. 1), if standard seat rings are<br>
mounted on both apertures A and B, then as is shown in FIG. 8, the flow coefficient is a<br>
high 0.6 or more, but the dimensionless swirl number is 0.<br><br>
In contrast, as is shown in FIGS. 3B, 3C, 4A, 4B, 4C, and 5A, if eccentric seat rings<br>
are mounted on both apertures A and B (seat ring combination Nos. 2 to 7), then as is<br>
shown in FIG. 8, it is possible to increase the dimensionless swirl number to between 0.15<br>
to 0.2, however, the flow coefficient is reduced to approximately 0.45 to 0.48.<br>
Furthermore, as is shown in FIGS. 5B, 5C, 6A, 6B, 6C, 7A, 7B and 7C, a standard<br>
seat ring was mounted on one of the apertures A or B, and an eccentric seat ring was<br>
mounted on the other aperture A or B (combination Nos. 8 to 15), and the relationships<br>
between the direction of the eccentric seat ring and the air flow properties were evaluated.<br>
As a result, as is shown in FIG. 6B, when an eccentric seat ring was mounted on<br>
aperture B and the direction thereof was set at 45° inward from the liner wall surface<br>
(combination No. 11), then the target characteristics were evident.<br>
Because aperture B is in a relatively distant position as seen from the intake<br>
manifold side, then it can be considered that an effect of a swirl flow being generated is<br>
obtained by using the cylinder liner wall surfaces. Moreover, in this case as well, a flow<br>
coefficient of approximately 0.54 to 0.55 was secured by mounting a standard seat ring on<br>
the aperture A.<br>
Namely, the flow coefficient is secured by the intake port on which the standard seat<br>
ring is mounted, while the swirl flow is strengthened by the intake port on which the<br>
eccentric seat ring 1 is mounted by employing an intake port on which is mounted the<br>
eccentric seat ring 1 that has the eccentric hole portion 3 together with an intake port on<br>
which is mounted a standard seat ring that has a non-eccentric hole portion 3.<br>
Consequently, it is possible to obtain the two conflicting elements of a secure flow<br>
coefficient and a strengthened swirl flow. As a result, a higher thermal efficiency is<br>
obtained compared with when only standard seat rings are mounted or with when only the<br>
eccentric seat rings 1 are mounted.<br>
Example<br>
Next, a description will be given of the result obtained when an engine having a seat<br>
ring structure corresponding to combination No. 11 (FIG. 6B) was prepared and a test was<br>
performed on the operation performance thereof.<br>
FIG. 9 is a plan view showing a cylinder head of an engine having a seat ring<br><br>
structure corresponding to combination No. 11. FIG. 10 is a graph showing a<br>
comparison of the thermal efficiency of the engine shown in FIG. 9 with that of an engine<br>
on which standard seat rings are mounted.<br>
The engine of this example was one in which seat rings having the seat ring<br>
structure of combination No. 11 (FIG. 6B) were fitted on a cylinder head of a 6 cylinder<br>
engine whose cylinders had a diameter of 220 mm. Namely, an eccentric seat ring was<br>
provided on the intake port in a relatively distant position as seen from the intake manifold<br>
side. In addition, as is shown by the arrow d in FIG. 9, the narrow portion of the edge of<br>
the eccentric seat ring was positioned on the exhaust port side at an angle of<br>
approximately 45° from the camshaft side.<br>
As a result, it was clear that, as is shown in FIG. 10, in the seat ring structure of the<br>
present embodiment in which the eccentric seat ring is mounted, the thermal efficiency<br>
was 0.2 to 0.5 points higher than the case in which only standard seat rings were mounted.<br>
As can be understood from the result of this example, the combination of the seat<br>
rings is optimized by mounting an eccentric seat ring on the intake port in a relatively<br>
distant position as seen from the intake manifold side, and by positioning the narrow<br>
portion of the edge of the eccentric seat ring on the exhaust port side at an angle of<br>
approximately 45° from the camshaft side. In this case, the wall surface of the cylinder<br>
liner can be effectively used, and a swirl flow can be can be generated effectively in the<br>
combustion chamber. Moreover, because the direction of the intake entry is along the<br>
wall surface of the cylinder liner and is also a direction that results in little interference<br>
with the intake from the intake port where the standard seat ring is mounted, the swirl flow<br>
can be strengthened and the flow coefficient can be secured.<br>
Note that, in the above described embodiment, the method to form an eccentric seat<br>
ring is not limited to that a description, given in FIG. 1, of when an eccentric seat ring 1<br>
having a non-symmetrical configuration between left and right is formed by first forming<br>
a convex circumferential surface 3a with an inner diameter ? A whose center is identical<br>
to the center a of the outer diameter, and by then cutting the circumferential surface of the<br>
inner diameter ? B in an eccentric position. For example, it is also possible to form the<br>
entire inner circumference as a convex circumferential surface and to form the entire inner<br><br>
circumference as a flat circumferential surface or the like, and to form an eccentric seat<br>
ring in which the thickness thereof varies but the left - right configuration is substantially<br>
similar.<br>
Furthermore, in the above described embodiment, a case is shown in which the<br>
eccentric seat ring 1 has a larger inner diameter ? B than the inner diameter ? A of the<br>
standard seat ring. However, in order to strengthen the swirl flow it is not essential that<br>
the inner diameter of the eccentric seat ring is larger than the inner diameter of the<br>
standard seat ring. It is also possible to make the inner diameter of the eccentric seat ring<br>
1 smaller than the inner diameter of the standard seat ring in an intake port of a cylinder<br>
head with a large flow coefficient. However, in the actual design thereof, because the<br>
flow coefficient and swirl flow are mutually conflicting characteristics, it is desirable that<br>
the inner diameter of the eccentric seat ring is larger than the inner diameter of the<br>
standard seat ring.<br>
Moreover, it is also possible to employ a structure in which each intake port<br>
independently communicates with the intake manifold. Although, in the above described<br>
embodiment, as is shown by the broken line in FIG. 3A, an example is shown in which<br>
two intake ports 13 and 14 each open onto a combustion chamber, and the other end<br>
portions of the two intake ports 13 and 14 are connected to each other so as to be in an<br>
upstream/ downstream relationship relative to the flow of the intake.<br>
Furthermore, it is also possible to employ a structure in which the camshaft side is<br>
positioned such that the intake manifold is on the opposite side and the intake manifold<br>
faces the exhaust manifold across the cylinder. Although, in the above described<br>
embodiment, in FIGS. 3A to 7C examples are shown in which the left side is the camshaft<br>
side and the right side is the manifold side (both the intake manifold and the exhaust<br>
manifold are on the same side).<br><br>
WE CLAIM :<br>
1. A cylinder head in which seat rings, against which are placed intake valves, are<br>
mounted respectively on a plurality of intake ports that communicate with a combustion<br>
chamber of an internal combustion engine, wherein, -<br>
among the plurality of intake ports, an intake port on which is mounted an<br>
eccentric seat ring, with a center of an inner diameter of said eccentric seat ring being<br>
eccentric relative to a center of an outer diameter of said eccentric seat ring, is present<br>
together with an intake port on which is mounted a standard seat ring, with a center of<br>
an inner diameter of said standard seat ring matching a center of an outer diameter of<br>
said standard seat ring ; and<br>
two of the intake ports are aligned in a direction from an intake manifold side<br>
towards an opposite side sandwiching the cylinder head, and the standard seat ring is<br>
mounted on one of the intake ports while the eccentric seat ring is mounted on the other<br>
intake port;<br>
characterized in that the eccentric seat ring is mounted on the intake port at a<br>
relatively distant position as seen from the intake manifold side.<br>
2. A cylinder head as claimed in claim 1, wherein two of the intake ports are<br>
provided between the intake manifold side and the camshaft side.<br>
3. A cylinder head as claimed in claim 1, wherein two exhaust ports are provided in<br>
the cylinder head in parallel with the two intake ports, and a narrow portion of an edge of<br>
the eccentric seat ring faces the exhaust port side at an angle of 45° relative to a<br>
direction heading from the manifold side towards the camshaft side.<br>
In the present invention, there is provided a cylinder head in which seat rings,<br>
against which are placed intake valves, are mounted respectively on a plurality of intake<br>
ports that communicate with a combustion chamber of an internal combustion engine, and,<br>
among the plurality of intake ports, an intake port on which is mounted an eccentric seat<br>
ring, with a center of an inner diameter of this eccentric seat ring being eccentric relative<br>
to a center of an outer diameter of this eccentric seat ring, is present together with an<br>
intake port on which is mounted a standard seat ring, with a center of an inner diameter of<br>
this standard seat ring matching a center of an outer diameter of this standard seat ring.<br>
As a result, a flow coefficient can be secured using the intake port on which the standard<br>
seat ring is mounted, and the swirl flow can be strengthened using the intake port on<br>
which the eccentric seat ring is mounted.    Consequently, it is possible to obtain the two<br>
conflicting elements of a secure flow coefficient and a strengthened swirl flow.</td>
