				<td>Energy guiding  chain     <br>
i<br>
The invention relates to an energy guiding chain for accommo¬dating cables, hoses and the like, having a number of chain links connected to one another in articulated fashion which are formed by parallel straps connected by cross-members, where the straps have lateral locking projections facing the inside of the chain for the detachable, snap-in accommodation of correspondingly designed cross-members or connectors. Energy guiding chains of this kind serve to guide cables, hoses and similar energy lines from one connecting point to another connecting point, where the position of at least one of the connecting points is variable.<br>
An example of an energy guiding chain of the type described above is known from DE 35 31 066 Al. The energy guiding chain described there essentially consists of straps provided alter¬nately with pins and circular bore holes, where the straps are connected to one another by way of detachable upper and lower cross-members to form a single chain link, where the pins of one chain link snap into the bore holes of the next chain link, so that the chain links can pivot relative to one another. In order to accommodate the detachable upper and lower cross-members, the straps are provided with inward-pointing projections or snap pins, which snap into recesses of the cross-members. The cross-members are easily and captively connected to the straps by being snapped onto the snap pins of the straps. Due, in particular, to the fact that the straps which respectively make up a single chain link are of mirror-image design with respect to one another, and that the upper and lower cross-members are identical, the known energy guid¬ing chain is simple to manufacture and easy to assemble.<br>
Another similar energy guiding chain is known from DE 39 09 797. This energy guiding chain also consists of similar paral¬lel" straps which can pivot relative to one another, which are<br><br>
connected to one another by way of detachable upper and lower cross-members, where the ends of the cross-members are attached in a detachable manner to straps positioned at the same height. In the case of this known energy guiding chain, the centre region of each chain strap is provided on both sides of the middle longitudinal plane of the chain strap with upper and lower projections, each of which having a T-shaped groove for accommodating the correspondingly shaped ends of the cross-members. The ends of the cross-members are of T-shaped design and can be inserted from the side into the grooves formed by the projections.<br>
In order to increase the effective cross-section of the chain, DE 39 09 797 proposes retrofittable, oblong adapters, which can be inserted in pairs into the T-shaped grooves of two straps positioned at the same height and which accommodate cross-members in between having the same design and the same fastening elements as the chain cross-members of the straps. These adapters are seated with one wall on the upper or lower edge of the straps and thus form an extension of the middle longitudinal plane of the straps. Consequently, only a two-strap chain is required, to which elements can be attached using the adapters to accommodate cables in addition to the cables or lines of this chain, so that the effective cross-section and thus the capacity of the chain can be substan¬tially increased, where cross-members of identical design can always be used.<br>
The solution proposed in DE 39 09 797 may have the advantage that cross-members of identical design can always be used, but it involves the disadvantage that the assembly of the elements which increase the effective cross-section of the chain is very complicated. Each adapter must always be mounted on each strap individually, which means that, if necessary, a total of four adapters must be mounted on each chain link and, in addi¬tion, one or more cross-members must be mounted in between them. Since the cross-members are inserted into T-shaped<br><br>
grooves extending in the longitudinal direction of the chain, it is complicated to subsequently open the energy guiding chain in order to insert or remove cables. For example, if several cross-members are mounted one above the other as sep¬arators in order to partition the inside of the expanded .cross-section or the original chain cross-section, the chain must virtually be disassembled entirely in order to insert cables into the chain cross-section bounded by the actual straps.<br>
Furthermore, in the design described above, the width of the expanded cross-section is predefined by the distance between the straps defining the width of the chain. For example, this makes it impossible to construct an expanded cross-section which is offset or asymmetrical in relation to the original chain cross-section defined by the straps.<br>
In addition, the existence of only two different types of parts, namely adapters and cross-members, permits only a few design alternatives as regards the construction and partition¬ing of the expanded cross-section.<br>
However, the most serious disadvantage of the known chain is the fact that it is more difficult to subsequently open the chain in order to insert or remove cables.<br>
A tubular, virtually completely closed energy guiding chain is known from US-PS 3,779,003, for example, whose links consist of a U-shaped base and a U-shaped cover which fits over the base. The U-shaped covers are provided with snap tabs, which fit over the sides of the base forming the respective chain link and snap into corresponding recesses. The covers described in US 3,779,003 form a closed, tubular energy guid¬ing chain such that the pivotal axes of the individual links are positioned below the middle longitudinal plane of the cable guide in order to permit a certain degree of sag. This results in the asymmetrical shape of the individual chain link<br><br>
or chain cross-section in relation to the pivotal axis of the links. The effective cross-section of the chain is not intended to be expanded in this way. The effective cross-sec¬tion of the chain described there is defined, and the ratio of the height of the sides of the chain links to the height of the covers is defined by the desired sag of the chain.<br>
DE 37 30 586 Cl describes the use of multi-part cross-members for an energy guiding chain, where the cross-members exhibit a centre section of adjustable length, in order to design the width of the interior space for the energy lines in such a way that it can be adapted to the thickness of the inserted energy lines. The cross-members are adjusted by cutting profile sec¬tions of the respective cross-members to the desired length. In this case, the effective cross-section is only expanded in terms of the width of the chain, where adjusting the chain in this way is very complicated and virtually irreversible if no additional material is used.<br>
The invention is thus based on the task of increasing the effective cross-section of the chain mentioned at the start using the simplest possible means and retaining the configur¬ation and design of the straps, where the advantage of easy opening and closing afforded by this type of chain is to be preserved and where the disadvantages described above are largely to be avoided.<br>
According to the invention, the task is solved in that at least some of the cross-members are designed as brackets, where at least one side of the bracket forms an extension of the cross-section bounded by the parallel upper and lower edges of the straps, and in that the brackets are provided with mounting surfaces extending roughly parallel to the upper and lower narrow sides of the straps and having recesses cor¬responding to the locking projections of the straps.<br>
Thus, the invention departs from the principle of always using<br><br>
cross-members of identical design in favour of a considerably simpler design. The use of brackets which expand the cross-section affords, in particular, the greatest possible freedom in designing the shape of the expanded cross-section, regard¬less of the width of the energy guiding chain defined by the distance between the straps.<br>
The brackets according to the invention can be round or also angular, these being easier to assemble than pairs of adapters mounted at the same height as the straps, between which addi¬tional cross-members can be inserted. In particular, the brackets can, if necessary, be designed to fold open in the interior partitions provided.<br>
The fact that the brackets are provided with mounting surfaces that extend roughly parallel to the upper and lower narrow sides of the straps and have recesses corresponding to the locking projections of the straps, ensures that the brackets can be snapped onto the locking projections on the straps on one or both sides of the chain in place of the otherwise stan¬dard cross-members. In this context, the mounting surfaces of the brackets are expediently designed in accordance with the mounting areas of conventional cross-members, so that the cross-members of a standard chain can be replaced as needed with the brackets according to the invention.<br>
The brackets are preferably designed as elements which form a rectangular expanded cross-section. This permits the use of known guide channels provided with slide rails in the chan¬nels, in which the energy guiding chains can be rolled up and unrolled with their expanded cross-sections formed by the brackets. Since the width of the brackets forming the expanded cross-section is independent of the width of the chain defined by the distance between the straps, a relatively wide energy guiding chain according to the invention can be used together with a narrow and shallow guide channel.<br><br>
For this purpose, at least the outer corners of the brackets are expediently reinforced with slide and/or guide surfaces. These surfaces ensure the quiet and low-wear running of the energy guiding chain in a guide channel.<br>
In a preferred configuration of	the invention, the brackets<br>
are of multi-part design, so that	they enable the construction<br>
of an expanded cross-section in	the form of a higher-order<br>
modular system.<br>
A modular structure of the expanded cross-section formed by the brackets is particularly possible if the width and/or height of the brackets can be changed using intermediate elements designed as adapters.<br>
The adapters can at least partially resemble the configuration of the locking projections. For example, adapters having lock¬ing projections on both sides can be provided for varying the height of the brackets, where the elements comprising the bracket can be completely or partially designed in the manner of conventional cross-members. For example, the adapters can also be designed with angled ends as corner pieces or as T-shaped elements with three mounting surfaces, or also as cross-shaped elements with four mounting surfaces.<br>
In a preferred configuration of the invention, the adapters have complementary snap-fitting elements, so that a standard bracket, for example, can be used for various chain widths.<br>
In another advantageous configuration of the invention, the inward-pointing locking projections of one strap of a chain link are provided with bearing bores, which form a hinge with bearing journals provided on the brackets or adapters. The brackets can thus be swung open on the hinge after opening one of the snap connections, this greatly facilitating the inser¬tion of cables and/or lines into the chain. In this context, the hinges are expediently designed such that the bearing<br><br>
journals can be unsnapped from the bearing bores when the brackets are swung open, thus ensuring easy removal of the brackets.<br>
The brackets and/or straps are preferably provided with addi¬tional fastening elements in order to accommodate interior partitions.<br>
In order to accommodate interior partitions, detachably mounted inserts which form locking projections can, for example, be provided as fastening elements, which can be inserted into the corresponding recesses of the brackets and/ or straps. For example, fastening elements of this kind enable cross-members to be inserted simply as cable-bearing separ¬ators in the brackets forming the expanded cross-section, or between the straps of the energy guiding chain.<br>
If the brackets are heavily loaded due to separators or other cable or hose-bearing interior partitions, it may be expedient to provide the brackets with support legs resting respectively on the cross-member opposite the bracket.<br>
Separate support members can be provided as an alternative, either supporting the brackets against the respective opposite cross-member or supporting opposite brackets of a chain link against each other.<br>
The locking projections can be designed as the known snap ridges, which interact with the known complementary recesses.<br>
In an alternative practical example of the invention, the brackets are designed as one-piece arches which form a tunnel-shaped expanded cross-section.<br>
The invention also relates to an intermediate element designed as an adapter for use with an energy guiding chain with the characteristics described above, which essentially consists of<br><br>
a web-like element provided on both sides with snap-fitting elements designed to be either complementary or'identical.<br>
If the intermediate element is intended to be used to vary the height of the brackets, locking projections are expediently provided as snap-fitting elements on both sides of the web-like element.<br>
In one configuration of the invention, the intermediate element is designed as a corner piece with mounting surfaces extending at, roughly right angles to one another.<br>
Lastly, the invention relates to an insert designed as a lock¬ing projection for use with an energy guiding chain with the characteristics -described above, which consists of a basic element designed as a known locking projection and an inte¬grated snap-in insert for insertion into a correspondingly shaped recess of a bracket and/or strap. For example, an insert of this kind enables separators to be inserted into the energy guiding chain in virtually any desired position, where conventional cross-members can be used as separators.<br>
The snap-in insert is preferably designed as a pin.<br><br>
Therefore, the present invention relates to an energy guiding chain for accommodating cables, hoses and the like, having a number of chain links connected to one another in articulated fashion which are formed by parallel straps connected by cross-members, where the straps have lateral locking projections facing the inside of the chain for the detachable, snap-in accommodation of correspondingly designed cross-members or connectors, characterized in that at least some of the cross-members are designed as brackets, where at least one side of the bracket forms an extension of the chain cross-section bounded by the parallel upper and lower edges of the straps, and that the brackets are provided with mounting surfaces extending parallel to the upper and lower narrow sides of the straps and having recesses corresponding to the locking projections of the straps.<br>

As shown in Fig. 27 and Figs. 1 to 3 in particular, the energy guiding chain according to the invention consists of chain links assembled to form a chain strand preferably bendable in one direction. The chain links consist of straps 1 of mirror-image design positioned parallel to one another and connected by upper and lower cross-members 2, 3. Straps 1 and upper and lower cross-members 2, 3 are injection-moulded from a thermoplastic material .<br>
Straps 1 are cranked inward relative to one another on one side of the chain link and each is provided with an outwardly protruding cylindrical pin 4. The other sides of straps 1 are cranked outward relative to one another and each is provided with a bore hole 5 dimensioned in accordance with pin 4. In place of bore hole 5, the inside of the outwardly cranked region of each of the straps can also be provided with a cy¬lindrical recess. Cylindrical pins 4 on the outside of the<br><br>
inwardly cranked strap sections engage bore holes 5 of the outwardly cranked strap sections of the adjacent chain link, so that an energy guiding chain is formed by two parallel strap strands which can bend in at least one direction.<br>
It is evident to a person skilled in the art that straps 1 need not necessarily be of cranked design. One of the two cross-members 2, 3 can be designed as an integral part of straps 1, although both upper cross-member 2 and lower cross-member 3 can be snap-fitted to straps 1 in detachable manner.<br>
Upper and lower cross-members 2, 3 which connect straps 1 respectively form the upper and lower walls of the channel formed by the chain links for the accommodation of hoses, cables and the like.<br>
Figure 7 shows a first practical example of the chain accord¬ing to the invention, in which upper cross-member 2 is designed as a rectangular bracket with mounting surfaces 6 running parallel to lower cross-member 3. Both the upper and the lower cross-member 2, 3 are snap-fitted in detachable manner onto integrally moulded locking projections 7 provided on the inside of straps 1. Locking projections 7 are repre¬sented by the broken lines in Fig. 7, where only upper locking projections 7 are visible. As mentioned at the start, lower cross-member 3 can, for example, also be designed as an inte¬gral part of straps 1.<br>
In Figs. 4 to 6, upper cross-member 2, designed as a rectangu¬lar bracket, is shown separately. Mounting surfaces 6 of the rectangular bracket are designed in accordance with the mounting surfaces of the known cross-members and provided with recesses 8 corresponding to locking projections 7. The inward-pointing locking projections 7 of straps 1 are each designed in the known manner as projections having a trapezoidal cross-section and bevelled snap ridges or undercut snap bevels 9 on both sides, these interacting with snap grooves provided in<br><br>
recesses 8 of the associated cross-member 2, 3.<br>
The design of locking projections 7 and recesses 8 is described here on the basis of adapter 11 illustrated in Figs. 17 to 21, which will be described below and whose configur¬ation corresponds to that of locking projections 7 and recesses 8 provided on mounting surfaces 6 of cross-members 2, 3 .<br>
The figures clearly show that upper cross-member 2 designed as a rectangular bracket forms an upper expansion of the effec¬tive chain cross-section for the cables, hoses and the like. This upper cross-member 2 can be assembled, locked and detached in a simple manner.<br>
The rectangular shape of the bracket permits the use of a shallow, narrow guide channel 12 as a guide for the energy guiding chain, as illustrated in the example in Fig. 16. In order to ensure low-friction and quiet running of the energy guiding chain in the guide channel, the corners of the brackets are reinforced with additional slide surfaces or guide surfaces 13. As Fig. 16 shows, the vertical sides of the brackets can also be reinforced with similar guide surfaces 13 .<br>
Figure 8 shows a practical example of the energy guiding chain according to the invention, where the bracket is of multi-part design and the side shown on the left in Fig. 8 is widened by an adapter 11 designed as an intermediate element. The design of adapter 11 is illustrated in Figs. 17 to 21. On the side shown on the left in Figs. 17, 20 and 21, adapter 11 is pro¬vided with a recess which, as mentioned above, corresponds to recesses 8 of mounting surfaces 6 of upper and lower cross-members 2, 3. The right-hand side of adapter 11 is designed as a locking projection 7, whose design corresponds to the inward-pointing locking projections 7 of straps 1. As an ex¬tension of mounting surface 6 of a bracket, adapter 11 is<br><br>
snap-fitted to the bracket and locking projection 7 of a strap 1. A stud 14 is located on the top of locking projection 7 of the associated strap 1, or on the top side of adapter 11, which engages a window-like hole 15 on mounting surface 6 of the bracket or in the recess 8 of adapter 11. The snap-in connection between the respective locking projection 7 and recess 8 can be prized open using a screwdriver in the window-like hole 15.<br>
In the practical example illustrated in Fig. 8, a known divid¬er 16 inserted between adapter 11 and lower cross-member 3 is provided in order to partition the effective cross-section of the energy guiding chain.<br>
Figure 9 shows another practical example of the energy guiding chain according to the invention, where the cross-section of the chain link is divided by additional interior partitions 17. The lower corners 18 of the bracket, angled towards the inside of the chain, are supported by separate support members 19 against the lower cross-member 3. In this context, support members 19 also serve to accommodate separators 20. On the ends facing the bracket, support members 19 are provided with angular supports 21, which accommodate the lower corners 18 of the brackets. These angular supports 21 can be provided with additional snap-fitting elements, into which the lower corners 18 of the brackets can be snapped.<br>
Figure 10 shows the energy guiding chain illustrated in Fig. 9, where additional separators 20 are provided in the expanded cross-section formed by the bracket. Known side-plates 22 are attached to the inside of the bracket in order to fasten sep¬arators 20. The separators can be inserted into side plates 22 such that the height is variable. Dividers 16 can be inserted between the separators in order to further partition the expanded cross-section.<br>
Figure 11 shows another version of the energy guiding chain<br><br>
according to the invention in which an intermediate cross-member 23 is inserted between straps 1. Intermediate cross-member 23 is designed in the manner of a conventional cross-member, where additional locking projections are provided on the insides of the straps in order to accommodate intermediate cross-member 23. These locking projections are designed as detachably fitted inserts 24 and illustrated in Figs. 22 to 24. The insert shown there is designed in the manner of a locking projection 7, where the insert is provided with a roughly T-shaped pin 25 which can be snapped into recesses (not shown) of straps 1 or the brackets.<br>
In the practical example illustrated in Fig. 11, additional corner partitions 26, with which smaller cables or hoses can be secured in the corners of the brackets, are provided for optimum utilisation of the expanded cross-section. Corner partitions 26 and dividers 16 are provided with forked clamp¬ing elements 27, with which they can be snap-fitted to the brackets.<br>
In the practical example shown in Fig. 12, intermediate cross-members 23 are mounted in the expanded cross-section formed by the brackets using inserts 24 described above. As the brackets are, by nature, under a heavy load due to the inserted inter¬mediate cross-members 23 and the cables and/or hoses lying on top of them, they are supported by support legs 28 against lower cross-member 3. The bottom ends of the support legs are of a design similar to dividers 16.<br>
Figure 13 shows a practical example of the energy guiding chain, where a cross-member designed as a bracket is provided in place of the standard design of lower cross-member 3. This expands the effective cross-section of the energy guiding chain both upwards and downwards. The inward-pointing corners 18 of the opposing brackets are supported against one another by means of support members 19 described above.<br><br>
In the practical example illustrated in Fig. 14, the effective cross-section of the energy guiding chain is again expanded on both sides of the straps by means of rectangular brackets, where the straps are furthermore provided with additional interior partitions by intermediate cross-members 23.<br>
Figure 15 shows an energy guiding chain with multi-part bracket of adjustable height, which is equipped with detachably mounted corner pieces 29. Corner pieces 29 are designed in the manner of adapter 11 illustrated in Figs. 17 to 21. Mounting surfaces 6 of corner pieces 29, extending roughly parallel to the upper narrow sides of straps 1, are designed as recesses 8, whose vertical ends extending upwards are designed as locking projections 7. The height of the bracket illustrated in Fig. 15 can easily be varied using several straight adapters 11 or corner pieces 29 of different sizes.<br>
The effective cross-section of the energy guiding chain ac¬cording to the invention can be expanded as needed in the manner of a higher-order modular system using adapters 11, inserts 24 and corner pieces 29, as well as the rectangular brackets.<br>
Adapters 11 and the brackets can be provided with hinges, for example, which enable the energy guiding chain to be easily be folded opened.<br>
Figures 25 to 27 illustrate a practical example of the inven¬tion, where the brackets forming upper cross-member 2 are designed as one-piece arches 30. These arches 30 enable a particularly simple and stable version of the energy guiding chain according to the invention.<br>
As shown in Fig. 25, the right-hand side of the bracket is pivot-mounted via bearing journals 31 in bearing bores 32 of the associated locking projection. When the bracket is in the<br><br>
open position, bearing journals 31 can easily be snapped out of bearing bores 32.<br>
For reasons of stability, arches 30 are provided with rein¬forcing ribs 33 running in the circumferential direction.<br>
Figures 28 to 31 show different versions of adapters 11, where Fig. 28 shows a corner pieces 29, for example, whose mounting surfaces 6 are both designed as locking projections 7 in the manner of locking projections 7 of chain straps 1.<br>
Figure 29 shows an adapter 11, which is of roughly T-shaped design, where two mounting surfaces 6 are provided with lock¬ing projections 7 and one mounting surface with recesses 8. The adapter 11 illustrated in. Fig. 30 is also of T-shaped design, where all three mounting surfaces 6 are equipped with locking projections 7. Finally, Fig. 31 shows a cross or star-shaped adapter 11, which is provided with four identically designed mounting surfaces 6 as locking projections 7.<br>
Figure 32 illustrates the various uses of adapters 11 shown in Figs. 28 to 31.<br>
