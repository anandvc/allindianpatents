The present invention relates to a device for receiving and separating chips and coolant collecting on machine tools, the coolant being returned for reuse and the chips being removed, having a receiving tank to receive the chips and the coolant, a rising guide section adjoining the receiving tank, an elevated discharge section adjoining the guide section, a chain-like closed transport element, which, at least in the region receiving the chips and the coolant and in the discharge section, is guided over deflection elements, at least one of which is coupled to a rotary drive, and a rotatably mounted filter drum, which is in drive connection with the transport element.<br>
During the transport of chips and coolant, blockages of the transport paths may not be completely prevented. In addition, the occurrence of the chips and the coolant may be distributed greatly irregularly over time. In turn, a backup of the coolant in the device and therefore also a rise of the coolant may result from this, which may, in the most unfavorable case, have an overflow of the unpurified coolant over the upper edge of the receiving tank as a consequence. Such an overflow may then reach regions which are to be kept clean and containers containing coolant which has already been purified.<br>
The object of the present invention is therefore, in case of such an overflow, to prevent the contamination of regions to be kept clean and of tanks containing coolant which has already been purified and, in addition, to make the overflow situation visually recognizable to the operating personnel.<br><br>
This object is achieved by a device of the type initially described according to the present invention in that holders, whose projecting ends, which are directed downward extend into an overflow channel, are tightly attached externally to the wall of the receiving tank; the overflow channel is guided around the device at a level below the upper edge of the receiving tank and is removably held on the straps, the overflow channel tightly covers tanks located beneath it having filtered coolant, the inner edge of the overflow channel neighboring the receiving tank lies at a higher level than the outer edge of the overflow channel, which is further away from the receiving tank, and at least one outlet device is provided in the bottom region of the overflow channel. The overflow channel has a storage volume which may accommodate overflowing contaminated coolant for some time. If this storage volume is not sufficient, an overflow occurs at the outer edge of the channel. The purified coolant located below the channel is protected from recontamination.<br>
According to a further suggestion of the present invention, the overflow channel may be implemented as U-shaped.<br>
According to a further suggestion of the present invention, the outlet device may have a screen which is fixed on the edge of an opening in the bottom of the overflow channel. The filter properties of the screen expediently correspond to those of the filter cloth which is used on the filter drum. In this way, it is ensured that the coolant which passes through the outlet device into a container having purified coolant is of the same degree of purity as the coolant located there, i.e. contamination is avoided. According to a further suggestion of the present invention, a cover is provided over the screen which leaves the flow to the screen free and which may be stepped on. Therefore, the overflow channel is passable and the screen is protected from stresses<br>
which are too high.<br>
Finally, according to a further suggestion of the present invention, the maximum pass-through volume flow of the outlet device (s) may be smaller than or equal to the maximum overflow volume flow.<br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a device for receiving and separating chips and coolant fluid collecting on machine tools, the coolant being returned reuse and the chips being removed, having a receiving tank to receive the chips and the coolant, a rising guide section adjoining the receiving tank, an elevated discharge section adjoining the guide section, a chain-like closed transport element, which, at least in the region receiving the chips and the coolant and in the discharge section, is guided over deflection elements, at least one of which is coupled to a rotary drive, and a rotatably mounted filter drum, which is in drive connection with the transport element, characterized in that holders whose projecting ends, which are directed downward, extend into an overflow channel, are tightly attached externally to the wall of the receiving tank that the overflow channel is guided around the device at a level below the upper edge of the receiving tank and is removably held on the holders, that the overflow channel tightly covers the tanks located beneath it having filtered coolant; that the inner edge of the overflow channel neighboring the receiving tank lies at a higher level than the outer edge of the overflow channel, which is further away from the receiving tank, and that at least one outlet device is provided in the bottom region of the overflow channel.<br>
In the following, an embodiment of the device according to the present invention is<br>
described with reference to the drawings.<br>
Fig. 1:	shows a side view of a device according to the present invention having<br>
an overflow channel,<br>
Fig. 2:	shows a top view of the overflow channel shown in Fig. 1,<br>
Fig. 2a:	shows a top view of the outlet device,<br>
Fig. 2b:	shows a section through the outlet device shown in Fig. 2a,<br>
Fig. 3:	shows a section along line A/A in Fig. 2, and<br>
Fig. 4:	shows a section alone line B/B in Fig. 2.<br><br>
Fig. 5:   shows a detail view of the connection between<br>
receiving tank and overflow channel.<br>
Fig. 1 shows the side view of an embodiment of the device according to the present invention having a receiving tank 1, which is open on top and receives the chips and coolant collecting on the machine tools. This receiving tank has an overflow edge 2. A rising guide section 3, which transits into an elevated discharge section 4, adjoins the receiving tank. A hinged belt conveyor 5, guided on both sides via rollers, is provided here as a transport element for transporting away the chips present in the coolant. This conveyor is guided around a lower deflection element 6 on the end of receiving tank 1 and runs around an upper deflection element 7, which is coupled to a drive, not shown, in the region of discharge section 4.<br>
The top view of the device is schematically illustrated in Fig. 2, an overflow channel 10 surrounding the entire device. Tanks 22 for receiving purified coolant may be located below overflow channel 10.<br>
Fig. 2a shows an aspect of an outlet device 17, which is inserted into an opening in overflow channel 10. Outlet device 17 includes a retaining plate 19, to which screen 20 and cover 18 are attached. In this case, the filter properties of screen 20 correspond to those of the filter drum. If unfiltered coolant now passes over overflow edge 2 into overflow channel 10, it will reach outlet device 17. The coolant will then run off through screen 20 into tanks 22 located below overflow channel 10, the chips still contained in the coolant being held back by screen 20, so that  only  filtered coolant  reaches  tanks  22  located<br><br>
underneath overflow channel 10. Cover 18 has a recess on each of its sides, through which the unfiltered coolant may flow to screen 20, and is used as a foot board.<br>
Fig. 2b shows a section through outlet device 17. It includes retaining plate 19, to the top of which cover 18 is attached. Screen 20 is held on the bottom of retaining plate 19 with the aid of screen attachment frame 21.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a section through the device along line A-A, which runs through rising guide section 3 of the device. In this section, overflow of receiving tank 1 will not occur. Nonetheless, it has been shown to be advantageous to lead overflow channel 10 around the entire device.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a section through the device along line B-B, which runs through receiving tank 1.   In this case, top edge 2 of receiving container 1 is simultaneously the lowest edge of receiving tank 1.  Therefore, if an overflow of coolant which is not yet been purified occurs, it will occur in this region.  Overflowing coolant will then flow on the outside of receiving tank 1 and over the upside-down U-shaped profile into overflow channel 10.  Subsequently, it will flow off into tank 22 via outlet device 17, chips contained therein being held back by screen 20.  For the case in which the quantity of overflowing coolant is greater than that flowing off through the outlet device, the coolant will first collect in overflow channel 10 and finally flow off over outer leg 16 of overflow channel 10, which has a lower height than inner leg 15 of overflow channel  10,  so that  in this way it  is  ensured that unfiltered coolant will not reach tank 22 having filtered coolant in any case.<br><br>
Fig. 5 shows a detailed view of the connection between receiving tank 1 and overflow channel 10. Straps 12 are welded onto the outer wall of receiving tank 1. In the exemplary embodiment, the straps are an upside-down U-shaped profile, whose one leg is welded onto the outer wall of receiving tank 1 and whose outer leg 14 engages in overflow channel 10. Receiving tank 1 is connected to overflow channel 10 using a screw connection via the upside-down U-shaped profile welded onto it. The overflow channel has an inner leg 15 facing the device and an outer leg 16 facing away from the device, height x of outer leg 16 being selected lower than height y of inner leg 15. This has the conseguence that when overflow channel 10 is filled, overflow occurs outward before the filling state possible here is achieved on inner leg 15 of overflow channel 10. Therefore, a seal is not necessary between outer leg 14 of upside-down JJ-shaped profile 12 and inner leg 15 of U-shaped overflow channel 10.<br><br>
