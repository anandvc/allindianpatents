				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to plant monitor display units for use in thermal power plants to provide a four-picture display.<br>
A thermal power plant usually uses a single multi-display unit which displays, for example, 4 pictures each selected by a user on a menu picture.<br>
For example, JP-A-2005-55965 Publication has proposed a plant monitor with a four-picture display unit which displays information on a piping system and/or a warning display.  JP-A-2001-125629 Publication has proposed a plant monitor display device with a four-picture display which is used to monitor a plurality of plants simultaneously.<br>
However, in prior art methods in which an operator himself or herself selects and displays display pictures, the number of times the operator is required to operate on the plant monitor to select and display target pictures is large and requires a great deal of time and labor.<br>
For example, in a thermal power plant, first, when a whole menu picture is displayed, buttons indicative of respective functions to operate the plant are displayed.  The operator selects one of the buttons to display a corresponding picture.  Assume, for<br>
example, that a menu picture concerning the entire piping system is displayed.  Since the piping system display picture covers many pages or pictures, the operator is required to select and display desired pages from among them.  That is, until the operator finally finds a desired picture, he or she must spend a great deal of time and labor.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the present invention to solve the above problem, select desired pictures in a reduced time and then display them on the 4-picture display.<br>
In order to achieve the above object, the present invention provides a plant monitor display unit with an at least four-picture display, comprising: a display recorder that records the number of times the operator displayed each of pictures on the display, and the number of times the operator operated on each of the displayed pictures; an operation processor that obtains at least three pictures of higher display frequencies which the operator displayed based on the numbers of times the operator displayed the respective pictures and the number of times the operator operated on the respective pictures; a display unit that displays the at least three pictures obtained by the operation processor on corresponding at least three locations of the at least four-picture display, and<br><br>
wherein the operation processor: calculates association degree factors of pictures associated with the respective at least three pictures in accordance with a predetermined calculation expression, selects as an associated one a picture of a larger association degree factor, and displays the selected associated picture on the remaining location of the at least four-picture display.<br>
In a preferable embodiment, each associated picture comprises a plurality of pictures different in weighting factor for a respective one of the three pictures of higher display frequencies.  The association degree factor is represented as the sum of association degree factors of a plurality of associated pictures different in weighting factor.<br>
According to the present invention, the four pictures displayed on the single display unit are automatically selected for each user based on the numbers of times the operator displayed the respective pictures and the number of times the operator operated on the respective displayed pictures in the past.  Thus, the time and labor required for the operator to display desired pictures are eliminated.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Referring to the accompanying drawings, an embodiment of the present invention will be described. FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an embodiment of a plant monitor display unit according to the present invention.<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, the plant monitor display unit of this embodiment comprises a display 1 which displays the state of a plant in four pictures, an operation input unit 2 which inputs an operator's name and his or her associated information, and an input/output controller 3 which functions as an interface between those external devices and an operation processing system.  The plant monitor display unit further comprises a display recorder 4, an operation processor 5, a display operation weighting factor table 6, an associated picture weighting factor table 7 and an associated picture table 8.<br>
In operation, first, when the plant monitor display unit is started up, the display 1 displays a message "Please input an operator's name." thereon. Thus, the operator inputs his or her name, using the operation input unit 2.  This inputted operator's name is recorded via the input/output controller 3 on the display recorder 4.<br>
Then, the operator displays any desired particular picture on the display 1, using the operation input unit 2.  The particular picture includes a picture on which a piping system of the plant is displayed, and a picture on which trends of temperatures and flow rates in a particular part of the piping system are displayed.<br>
The number of times which the operator displayed the picture is recorded via the i<br>
controller 3 on the display recorder 4.  The number of times of display of this picture composes information associated with the operator and is recorded as information associated with the operator's name beforehand recorded.<br>
Then, the operator performs any particular operation on the displayed picture, using the operation input unit 2.  The particular operation includes clicking signs and analog values appearing on the picture which display the piping system.  For example, when a pump image in the piping system picture is clicked, a window will be displayed which indicates the state of a digital input signal from the plant and we can know whether the pump is on or off.  When an analog value is clicked, a trend of analog values is displayed on the window.<br>
The number of times of operation of the display picture implies the number of times which the operator clicked the specified pump image on the display picture and is recorded along with the operator's name, stored beforehand, as associated information via the input/output controller 3 on the display recorder 4.<br>
FIG. 2 illustrates a result of records made on the display recorder 4.  An operator W is assumed to be one who, for example, operates the plant.  FIG. 2 shows that the operator W displayed a picture A E times. It also shows that the operator W operated on the<br>
picture A I times.  Similarly, FIG. 2 shows that the operator W displayed pictures B, C, D, .... F, G, H.... times, respectively, and operated on the display pictures B, C, D, .... J, K, L... times, respectively.<br>
An operator WW is assumed to be one who, for example, manages operation of the whole plant or manages the operator W who operates the plant.  A picture on the display unit 1 which the operator W displays does not necessarily coincide with that on the display unit 1 which the operator WW displays.  FIG. 2 shows that pictures AA, BB, CC, DD, ... are displayed EE, FF, GG, HH... times, ... and operated II, JJ, KK, LL ... times, respectively, by the operator WW.<br>
The numbers of times of display and operation shown in FIG. 2 are used to select three pictures displayed in association with the operator W or WW as well as to calculate a fourth picture associated with each of the operators.<br>
Then, the operator input a weighting factor for the number of times of display to each of the pictures displayed on the display unit 1, and a "weighting" (a weighting factor for the number of times of operation) in accordance with an arbitrary operation on a displayed picture (such as a clicking a pump image).<br>
The weighting factor for the number of times of display is for "weighing" a degree of importance to each of the displayed picture by an operator, and is<br><br>
normally set to a range of "0" to "1".<br>
The weighting factor for the number of times of operation is for "weighing" a degree of importance of the operation on the display picture (for example, a clicking a pump image), as well as the weighting factor for the number of the times of display, and is set to a range of "0" to "1".<br>
Some pictures are only viewed by the operator and need not be operated.  The weighting factor for the number of times of display of such displayed picture is close to "1" and the weighting factor for the number of times of operation of that picture is close to "0". With a picture on which the start-up and stop states of the pump must be often monitored or the temperature of a particular location in the piping system must be monitored at all times, the weighting factor for the number of times of operation is set so as to be close to "1" even when the weighting factor for the number of display is low.<br>
The inputted weighting factors for the numbers of times of display and operation are recorded via the input/output controller 3 on the display and operation weighting factor table 6.  These weighting factors are used when three pictures displayed in association with the operator are selected as well as when a fourth (or associated) picture associated with the displayed three pictures is acquired.<br>
FIG. 3 illustrates a result of inputs given<br>
to the display and operation weighting factor table 6. Pictures A, B, C, D, ... associated with the operator W will be given as an example.  The weighting factors for the numbers of times of display and operation of the picture A are denoted by M and Q, respectively. Similarly, the weighting factors for the numbers of times of display of pictures B, C, D, ... are denoted by N, O, P, ..., respectively, and the weighting factors for the numbers of times of operation of the pictures B, C, D,... are denoted by R, S, T, ..., respectively.<br>
Then, the operator inputs associated picture weighting factors, using the operation input unit 2. For example, when the operator is W and a picture A involves a piping system, the associated picture refers to a graph indicating a trend of temperature, flow or pressure at a particular location in the piping system. In FIG. 4, different weighting factors U and V are illustrated as applied to associated pictures (1) and (2), respectively, and recorded via the input/output controller 3 to the associated picture weighting factor table 7 where it is assumed to be U&gt;V.<br>
Then, the operator W inputs, as pictures (I) and (2), ones associated highly with each of pictures A, B, C, D, ... which the user wishes to display, using the operation input unit 2.  The operator selects, for example, pictures X and Y as the pictures (1) and (2), respectively, associated highly with the picture A.<br>
Similarly, the operator selects, for example, pictures Y, Z and X as the pictures (1) associated highly with the picture B, C, and D, respectively.  Similarly, the operator selects, for example, pictures Z, X and Y as the pictures (2) associated highly with the pictures B, C and D, respectively.  These associated pictures (1) and (2) are recorded via the input/output controller 3 on the associated picture table 8.  FIG. 5 illustrates these records made on the table 8.<br>
Next, a method of selecting three pictures which will be displayed preferentially depending on each operator based on a flowchart of FIG. 6, the block diagram of FIG. 1, and calculation charts of FIGS. 7 and 8, and a method of selecting pictures associated with the three displayed pictures will be described.<br>
First, an optimal picture call button (not shown) is depressed or clicked by an operator's name W inputted on the display picture (step SI).  This starts up selection of four pictures which the operator W wishes to display.<br>
When the optimal picture call request is made, the operator's name recorded-on the display recorder 4 of FIG. 2 is selected and then sent via the input/output controller 3 to the operation processor 5. Then, information indicative of the clicking of the button or a request for the optimal picture calling function is sent via the input/output controller 3 to the operation processor 5.<br>
In response to this request, the operation processor 5 starts an optimal picture calling process, using data of FIGS. 2-5 stored on the display recorder 4, display operation weighting factor table 6, associated picture weighting factor table 7 and associated picture table 8.<br>
More particularly, as shown in FIG. 6, when the optimal picture calling button is clicked, display priorities of the respective pictures A, B, C, D, ... associated with the operator W are calculated (step S2). More specifically, the display priority AA of the picture A is calculated in accordance with an expression of FIG. 7 (step S21).<br>
In this operation, the operation processor 5 reads from the display operation weighting factor table 6, weighing factors M, N, 0, P, ... for the number of times of display, and weighting factors Q, R, S, T, ... for the numbers of times of operation, of the respective pictures A, B, C, D,..., respectively.<br>
Then, the operation processor 5 calculates display priorities shown in a frame 9 of FIG. 7 based on these read data.  First, the operation processor 5 calculates a display priority factor AA for the displayed picture A.  The display priority factor AA is given as the sum of the number of times of display E of the displayed picture A times a weighing factor M for the number of times of display E and the number of times of operation I of the picture A times a weighting<br><br>
factor Q for the number of times of operation 1.<br>
Then, the operation processor 5 likewise calculates the display priority factors BB, CC, DD, . of the pictures B, C, D, . . . ., respectively, as shown in FIG. 7 (steps S22 and S23).<br>
Then, the operation processor 5 compares the display priority factors for the respective pictures, thereby ranking these factors in a descending order. Each rank represents a priority with which a respective picture is displayed.  In FIG. 7, the display priorities for the respective pictures A, B, C, D, ... are illustrated so as to be AA&gt;BB&gt;CC&gt;DD ....  Thus, three pictures of higher display priorities (in FIG. 7,<br>
A,	B and C) to be displayed are selected from the top<br>
of the list of the pictures ranked in the descending<br>
order of display priority; i.e. A, B and C.<br>
When the three pictures to be displayed are determined in this way, the operation processor 5 sends a request to display these three pictures on the display unit 1 to the input/output controller 3. In case of Fig. 7, a request to display these three pictures A, B, and C on the display unit l is sent to the input/output controller 3. In response to this request, the input/output controller 3 controls the display unit I so as to display these three pictures A,<br>
B,	and C from the operation processor 5 on the display<br>
unit 1 (step S3).<br>
Then, the operation processor 5 calculates a<br>
degree of association of each of two pictures (1) and (2) with a respective one of the three displayed pictures of higher display priorities (step S4) .  To this end, first, the operation processor 5 reads from the association picture table 8 the two pictures (1) and (2) associated with the respective one of three pictures.  As shown in FIG. 5, since the three pictures of higher display priorities are A, B and C, their associated pictures (1) are X, Y and Z, respectively. The associated pictures (2) are Y, Z and X,<br>
In the association degree calculations in step S4, the operation processor 5 first calculates respective association degree factors of the associated pictures (1) (step S41).  More particularly, the operation processor 5 calculates association degree factors AA1, BB1 and CC1 of the pictures (1) X, Y and Z associated with the three pictures A, B and C of higher display priorities, respectively.  As shown in a frame 10 of FIG. 8, the association degree factors AA1, BB1 and CC1 of the associated pictures (l) are represented as display priority factors AA, BB and CC of the pictures of higher display priorities with which the pictures (1) X, Y and Z, respectively, are associated and each multiplied by an associated picture weighting factor U.<br>
Similarly, as shown in a frame 11 of FIG. 8, the operation processor 5 calculates association degree factors AA2, BB2 and CC2 of the pictures (2) Y, Z and X<br>
associated with the pictures A, B and C, respectively (step S42).  That is, since the association picture weighting factor of the association pictures (2) is V, the association degree factors AA2, BB2 and CC2 are represented as the display priorities AA, BB and CC of the pictures A, B and C, respectively, and each multiplied by the weighting factor V of the association pictures (2).<br>
Then, in the flowchart of FIG. 6, the operation processor 5 calculates association degree factors XX, YY and ZZ of the respective pictures X, Y and Z obtained in step S4 and associated with the three pictures to be displayed (step S5).  That is, the association degree factors XX, YY and ZZ of. the association pictures X, Y and Z, respectively, are obtained as the respective sums of the association degree factors AA1, BB1 and CC1 of the association pictures (1) and the corresponding association degree factors AA2, BB2 and CC2 of the association pictures (2), as shown in frame 12 of FIG. 8.  Then, the operation processor 5 compares the association degree factors XX, YY and ZZ of the respective pictures X, Y and Z and ranks the association degree factors in a descending order.  This ranking represents an association degree of each picture.  In FIG. 8, as shown in the frame 12 of FIG. 8, since XX&gt;YY&gt;ZZ, the association picture X is displayed as a fourth picture on the display unit 1.<br>
That is, the operation processor 5 sends the input/output controller 3 a request to display the picture X as one of a higher association degree.  The input/output controller 3 receives the request from the operation processor 5 and displays it on the display unit 1 (step S6).<br>
While in the above description the<br>
association pictures are illustrated as including the pictures (1) and (2), three or more association pictures may be used.<br>
FIG. 9 shows a change in the picture<br>
displayed on the display unit 1 when in one embodiment the optimal picture calling function according to the present invention is required.  By requesting the optimal picture calling function and selecting the operator's name, three pictures of higher operator's name display frequencies and a picture of the highest association degree with the three pictures are displayed on the display unit 1.<br>
As illustrated in the above, in the plant monitor display unit according to the present invention, four pictures optimal for the operator who operates the plant are displayed.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
