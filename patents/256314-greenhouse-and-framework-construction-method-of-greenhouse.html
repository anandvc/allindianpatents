CERTIFICATE u/r. 20(3)(b)<br>
I, Mr. HIRAL CHANDRAKANT JOSHI, an authorized agent for the applicant, ODE TAKEHISA do hereby verify that the content of English translated complete specification filed in pursuance of PCT International application No. PCT/JP06/316311 thereof is correct and complete.<br><br><br><br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates a greenhouse and a framework construction method of the greenhouse.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
There is conventionally known a framework construction method of a greenhouse including a step of assembling a structure composed of a rectangular frame disposed horizontally, a rectangular main beam disposed on the frame vertically and a principal rafter supporting the main beam and a step of installing a plurality of the assembled structures adjacent to each other on a pillar, which is component of a support portion of a greenhouse (refer to Pamphlet of International Publication No. 2005/058015). According to the construction method, a lifting workload and building workload at a high place can be greatly reduced.<br>
However, when the above construction method is simply applied, since pillars for supporting the four corners of the respective structures are necessary, and therefore the distance PI of two pillars 2 disposed in the greenhouse and aligned in either of the width direction and the depth direction is ordinarily made about one half of the distance P2 in the other direction as shown in Fig. 12. On the other hand, even in a conventional ordinary framework construction method without using the above described structure, the distance of two pillars disposed in the greenhouse and aligned in either of the width direction and the depth direction is ordinarily made about one half of the distance in the other direction (refer to, for example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Publication No. 2002-291348).<br>
That is, in the conventional greenhouse, the ratio of the distance in the width direction and the distance in the depth direction is made about 2:1 or about 1:2 to endure a vertical load and a horizontal load applied to a roof.<br>
However, since the distances between the pillars are set as described above, a problem arises in that a direction in which ridges are formed is restricted. That is, in the conventional greenhouse, ridges 8 has been necessarily formed along a direction<br><br><br>
in which the distance between the pillars 2 is narrower in the greenhouse as shown in Fig. 13 (for example, in a depth direction in Fig. 13) in order to effectively use a limited cultivating area.<br>
Since it is intrinsically preferable to form ridges along a direction having a good sunshine condition, a design of a greenhouse has a restriction in that the direction of a ridge of the roof and a layout of pillars must be set according to a direction in which ridges are formed.<br>

c.	a step of disposing a connecting member between an intersection of a main<br>
beam and a principal rafter of the one structure, which is a component of the coupled body assembled at the step b, and an intersection of a main beam and a principal rafter of the other structure, which is a component of the coupled body assembled at the step b; and<br>
d.	a step of supporting the four corners of the coupled body, to which the<br>
connecting member is disposed, by pillars.<br>
ADVANTAGES OF THE INVENTION<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
An embodiment of the present invention will be explained referring to the drawings.<br>
EMBODIMENT<br>
Fig. 1 is a perspective view showing a structure employed in an embodiment of the present invention. As shown in the drawings, the structure 1 is structured using a frame 11, a main beam 12, and a principal rafter 13.<br>
As shown in Fig. 2, the frame 11 is formed in a rectangular shape with a pair of end beams 11 a and lib disposed in parallel with each other, a pair of side beams lie and lid disposed orthogonal to the respective end beams 11a and 11b. The frame 11 further includes middle beams lie and 11f disposed between the side beams lie and lid, and braces 11g disposed in a space surrounded by the middle beams lie and 11f, the end beams 11a and lib, and the side beams lie and lid in the inside thereof. Various layouts can be assumed as a layout of the middle beams lie and 11f and the braces 11g, and an appropriate layout may be used from a point of view of strength.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3, the main beam 12 is formed in a rectangular shape with chord members 12a and 12b disposed above and below in parallel and truss members 12c and 12d disposed between both the ends of the chord members 12a and 12b. The main beam 12 further includes the truss members 12e disposed between each of the chord members 12a and 12b, and diagonal members 12f disposed in spaces surrounded by the truss members 12e, the chord members 12a and 12b and the end truss members 12c and 12d. As shown in Figs. 1 and 4, the main beam 12 is disposed vertically on the frame 11 disposed horizontally and arranged three-dimensionally in an inverted-T shape together with the frame 11.<br><br><br>
As shown in Figs. 1 and 4, one ends of the principal rafters 13 are jointed to main beam 12 and the other ends of the principal rafters are jointed to frame 11 on both sides of the main beam 12 to support the main beam 12.<br>
The structure 1 structured as described above can be constructed as a single structural body independent of supporting portions (portions for supporting a roof) of the greenhouse. That is, the structure 1 is not necessarily constructed by carrying the frame 11, the main beam 12 and the principal rafter 13 or members constituting those respectively on pillars standing on a base and then assembling those members, but the structure 1 can be constructed on the ground, in a factory or the like other than a building site.<br>
Further, the end beams 11 a and lib, the side beams lie and lid, and the middle beams lie and 11f, which are components of the frame 11, and the chord members 12a and 12b, the end truss members 12c and 12d, the truss members 12e, the diagonal members 12f, and the principal rafter 13, which are components of the main beam 12 can be made of a steel member having the same shape and the same size (for example, channel steel with lip) and thus these members can be easily obtained as modules.<br>
Further, all steel members, of which constitute the frame 11, the main beam 12, and the principal rafter 13 are made, can be jointed with each other by screws. Accordingly, the structure 1 has an advantage that when the structure 1 is assembled, it is not necessary to weld steels with each other. Further, the greatest advantage is that excellent assembly accuracy can be realized for the structure 1, a roof framing of a greenhouse using the structure 1, and further a framework of a greenhouse, since assembly accuracy is not deteriorated by welding distortion.<br>
The roof framing of the greenhouse according to the embodiment is structured by adjacently disposing a plurality of coupled bodies each composed of the two structures 1 (1A) and 1 (IB) coupled with each other on the pillars, which are<br><br><br>
components of the support portions of the greenhouse. As shown in Fig. 5 (a), each coupled body is disposed such that the length ratio of two orthogonal sides A and B is about 1:1 by coupling the frames 11 and 11 of the two structures 1(1 A) and 1 (IB) each other. Further, as shown in Fig. 5(b), the coupled body includes a connecting member 15 disposed between the intersection of a main beam 12 and a principal rafter 13 of one structure 1 (1A) and the intersection of a main beam 12 and a principal rafter 13 of the other structure 1 (IB).<br>
Next, a framework construction method of the greenhouse using the above-mentioned coupled bodies will be explained.<br>
First, the structure 1 is assembled follows. That is, the members (steel members), of which the frame 11, the main beam 12, and the principal rafter 13 are made, are previously cut to predetermined lengths and holes to be used for screwing are made on the joint part of the steal members in a factory or the like and then transported to a building site. At the building site, first, using the steel members, the frame 11 and the main beam 12 are assembled by fixing them with screws. Next, the main beam 12 is disposed on the frame 11 as well as the principal rafters 13 are disposed on both the sides of the main beam 12, and they are jointed to each other with screws and thereby the structure 1 is assembled. Accordingly, the structure 1 can be assembled only by jointing the respective steel members with each other using the screws and the like without a job for welding steel members with each other and a job for adjusting the lengths of the steel members or the like at the building site. Note that when a transport condition is satisfied, the frame 11 and the main beam 12 may be previously assembled in the factory or the like and then transported to the building site.<br>
A job for assembling the structure 1 can be carried out on the ground. That is, since the structure 1 has such a structure that it can be independently constructed without a need of pillars, which are components of the support portions of the greenhouse as<br><br><br>
described above, the structure 1 need not be constructed in a high location and can be assembled on the ground.<br>
Accordingly, the structure 1 can be assembled more efficiently comparing to a case in which it is assembled in the high place,<br>
There are prepared a plurality of the structures 1. As shown in Fig. 6 (a), the respective structures 1 are made such that the length ratio of two orthogonal sides a and bis about 1:2.<br>
The coupled body is assembled by coupling the two structures 1(1 A) and 1(1B) assembled as described above. That is, first, the coupled body is arranged by coupling the frame 11 of the one structure 1 (1A) and the frame 11 of the other structure 1(1B) so that the length ratio of the two orthogonal sides A and B is made about 1:1 (refer to Figs. 5 (a) and (b)). Next, the connecting member 15 is disposed between the intersection of the main beam 12 and the principal rafter 13 of the one structure 1 (1A) and the intersection of the main beam 12 and the principal rafter 13 of the other structure I (IB), where the structures 1 (1A) and 1 (IB) are the components of the coupled body (refer to Fig.5(b)).<br>
The coupled body, to which the connecting member 15 is connected, is transported onto the pillars 2 standing on a base 7 using a crane or the like. Since the coupled body assembled on the ground is lifted as described above rather than lifting the structure 1 or respective members constituting the structure 1, the number of a lifting job can be greatly reduced even if a plurality of the coupled bodies are lifted comparing to a case in which the structure 1 or the respective members constituting the structure 1 are lifted.<br>
The coupled body may include a secondary member such as a covering member of a greenhouse (for example, a plastic film, or a plate member made of a glass, or a resin) and a support member (for example, an arch pipe, a frame member, and the like) for supporting the covering member. Typical examples of the secondary<br><br><br>
member include the covering member, the support member of the covering member, a skylight window, a trough, and the like. Since the secondary member can be also assembled on the ground, it can be more effectively assembled and further a job itself can be carried out more easily comparing to a case in which it is assembled in a high place. Further, an amount of lifting activity can be greatly reduced by assembling the coupled body including the secondary member on the ground and then transporting the coupled body onto the pillars. Fig. 7 shows an example of the coupled body having a support member 14 (an arch pipe for supporting a plastic film used as a covering member) as the secondary member.<br>
The coupled body is installed by being supported by the pillars 2 (2a - 2d) at the four corners CI - C4 thereof (refer to Figs. 6(b)-(e)). The length ratio of the two orthogonal sides of the coupled body is about 1:1. Thus, by supporting the four corners of the coupled body with the pillars 2, respectively, the distance P2 in the width direction and the distance PI in the depth direction of the pillars 2 disposed in the greenhouse can be made substantially the same distance. Therefore, it is possible to set, for example, the distance P2 in the width direction to 9m and the distance PI in the depth direction also to 9m. Further, since the distance P2 in the width direction and the distance PI in the depth direction are made substantially the same distance, the number of the pillars 2 disposed in the greenhouse can be reduced, thereby it is possible to reduce an amount of sunlight shielded by the pillars 2.<br>
A plurality of the coupled bodies are installed adjacent to each other on the pillars 2, which are components of the support portions of the greenhouse. As shown in Figs. 9 and 10, the respective coupled bodies are fixed on the support portions by gathering the corner portions of the respective frames 11, which are coupled bodies adjacent to each other, onto plates 5 disposed on the apexes of the respective pillars 2 and joining them by pins. With this arrangement, since the respective coupled bodies are integrated through the plates 5, a horizontal load can be transmitted to the pillars standing around the outer peripheral portion of the greenhouse. Vertical braces are appropriately provided between the pillars of the outer peripheral portion, thereby<br><br><br>
the horizontal load can be transmitted to the base. Further, since the corner portions of the plurality of coupled bodies are gathered to one pillar 2 through the plate 5 and jointed by the pins, the number of the pillars 2 can be minimized.<br>
According to the greenhouse of the embodiment, the distance P2 in the width direction and the distance PI in the depth direction of the pillars 2 disposed in the greenhouse are made substantially the same distance. Thus, as shown in, for example, Fig. 11, the direction of ridges 8 can be freely set according to cultivated plants without reducing a cultivating area. Further, since the direction of the ridges 8 can be freely set as described above, the direction of a ridge of the roof, the layout of the pillars 2, and the like are not restricted, thereby the greenhouse can be freely designed.<br>
Note that the "ridge" usually means an elongated linear area where soil is banked in a field to cultivate plants. In the greenhouse, however, the ridge means an elongated linear area where soil is banked in the greenhouse to cultivate plants. Further, according to the greenhouse of the embodiment, it is needless to say that even when a cultivating device and the like are disposed linearly in the area for the ridges in the greenhouse, an advantage similar to that when using the ridges can be obtained.<br>
Further, according to the greenhouse of the embodiment, since the coupled body, in which the frames 11,11 of the two structures 1(1A) and 1(1B) each having excellent strength to a vertical load and a horizontal load are coupled with each other and which has the connecting member 15 disposed between the intersection of the main beam 12 and the principal rafter 13 of the one structure 1 (1 A) and the intersection of the main beam 12 and the principal rafter 13 of the other structure 1 (IB), is employed as the roof framing, and the four corners of the coupled body are supported by the pillars 2. As a result, a beam member for supporting the roof framing can be unnecessary.<br><br><br>
