				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a milling cutter having indexable cutting<br>
inserts with serrated cutting edges for metal cutting operations.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Cutting inserts with serrated cutting edges enable higher metal removal<br>
rates as compared with cutting inserts having non - serrated cutting edges.<br>
However, this is achieved at the expense of rougher surface finish. In order to<br>
improve the surface finish, the cutting inserts are mounted on the milling cutter with<br>
the serrations of consecutive cutting inserts offset, or out of phase, in relation to<br>
each other.<br>
There are many examples of cutting inserts with serrated cutting edges<br>
disclosed in the art. Triangular, square, round, and rectangular shaped cutting<br>
inserts are disclosed, respectively, in US 3,574,911; US 3,636,602; US 3,922,766;<br>
and US 4,936,719.<br>
However, all the prior art milling cutters using cutting inserts with<br>
serrated cutting edges suffer from the same problem, namely, the operative cutting<br>
teeth (i. e., "crests" of the serrations) are not supported by the milling cutter body.<br><br>
WO 2005/009660	PCT/IL2004/000626<br>
-2-<br>
In other words, the operative cutting teeth project beyond the adjacent milling cutter<br>
body surface. Consequently, the operative cutting teeth are liable to break off<br>
during milling operations.<br>
Moreover, the prior art cutting inserts with serrated cutting edges all have<br>
the form of flat slabs with opposing flat parallel rake and base surfaces. When such<br>
prior art inserts are mounted in an insert pocket, the flat base surface of the cutting<br>
insert abuts a corresponding flat support surface of the insert pocket. The cutting<br>
insert is retained in the insert pocket by means of a clamp that presses down on the<br>
rake surface of the cutting insert. Such an arrangement is not particularly robust,<br>
and twisting moments acting on the cutting insert during milling operations will<br>
tend to rotate the cutting insert from its initial position.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a milling cutter and a<br>
cutting insert therefor, the cutting insert having serrated cutting edges, that<br>
significantly overcome the aforementioned disadvantages.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with the present invention there is provided a milling<br>
cutter comprising a cutter body having at least one cutting portion with a replaceable<br>
cutting insert having a serrated cutting edge secured thereto, the at least one cutting<br>
portion having a serrated outer surface and the cutting insert having an aligned<br>
matching serrated peripheral surface.<br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
at least one cutting portion comprises an insert pocket having a generally annular<br>
support surface with a recess extending downwardly from the support surface to a<br>
base surface with a peripheral wall extending therebetween.<br>
The cutting insert comprises an upper rake surface, an intermediate<br>
abutment surface and the serrated peripheral surface extending therebetween, the<br>
serrated peripheral surface intersecting the upper rake surface at the serrated cutting<br>
edge, a protrusion extends downwardly from the intermediate abutment surface, the<br><br>
WO 2005/009660	PCT/IL2004/000626<br>
-3-<br>
protrusion  comprising  an  outer  surface  extending  between   the  intermediate<br>
abutment surface and a bottom surface.<br>
Preferably, the outer surface of the protrusion comprises four flat<br>
protrusion side surfaces interconnected by protrusion corners and the peripheral wall<br>
of the recess comprises four recess side surfaces interconnected by recess corners.<br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a<br>
threaded bore extends downwardly from the base surface of the recess, a through<br>
bore extends between the upper rake surface and the bottom surface of the cutting<br>
insert, and a retaining screw passes through the through bore and threadingly<br>
engages the threaded bore, thus locating the protrusion in the recess and securing the<br>
cutting insert to the insert pocket.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the intermediate abutment<br>
surface of the cutting insert abuts the support surface of the insert pocket.<br>
Preferably, two adjacent flat protrusion side surfaces abut two adjacent<br>
recess side surfaces of the recess.<br>
Further preferably, there is a gap between the bottom surface of the<br>
protrusion and the base surface of the recess.<br>
Yet further preferably, there is a clearance between each recess corner<br>
and each adjacent protrusion corner.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Attention is first drawn to Figs. 1 to 4. A milling cutter 10 has an axis of<br>
rotation A and comprises a cutter body 12 having a rear shank 14 and five cutting<br>
portions 16 adjacent a front face 18 of the cutter body 12. Each cutting portion 16<br>
has a replaceable and indexable cutting insert 20 secured thereto. Each cutting<br>
insert 20 has a serrated peripheral surface 22 comprising crests 22' and troughs 22",<br>
and each cutting portion 16 of the cutter body 12 has a serrated outer surface 24<br>
comprising crests 24' and troughs 24". The serrated peripheral surface 22 of each<br>
cutting insert 20 matches, and is aligned with, the serrated outer surfaces 24 of the<br>
cutting portion 16 to which it is secured. In other words, for a given cutting insert<br>
20 secured to a given cutting portion 16, the crests 22' and troughs 22" of the<br>
serrated peripheral surface 22 of the cutting insert 20, are aligned with the crests 24'<br>
and troughs 24" of the serrated outer surface 24 of the cutting portion 16.<br>
Each cutting portion 16 comprises an insert pocket 26 and a chip gullet<br>
28. The chip gullet 28 of a given cutting portion 16 defines a rear wall 30 of an<br>
adjacent cutting portion 16. The serrated outer surface 24 of the cutting portion 16<br><br>
WO 2005/009660	PCT/IL2004/000626<br>
-5-<br>
extends between the insert pocket 26 and the rear wall 30, and merges with the<br>
shank 14 of the cutter body 12.<br>
The insert pocket 26 comprises a generally annular support surface 32,<br>
and a recess 34 extending downwardly from the support surface 32. The recess 34<br>
comprises a peripheral wall 36 extending between the support surface 32 and a base<br>
surface 38 of the recess 34. The peripheral wall 36 of the recess 34 comprises four<br>
inner planar side surfaces 40 interconnected by recess corners 42. The base surface<br>
38 of the recess 34 has a threaded bore 44 having an axis B. The threaded bore 44 is<br>
generally orthogonal to, and extends downwardly from, the base surface 38 and is<br>
eccentrically disposed in relation to the geometrical center C of the recess 34.<br>
Attention is now drawn to Figs. 5a, 5b, 6, and 7. The cutting insert 20<br>
has a serrated circular in shape in a top view, and has an insert symmetry axis I. The<br>
cutting insert 20 comprises an upper rake surface 46, an intermediate abutment<br>
surface 48, and the serrated peripheral surface 22 extending therebetween. The<br>
serrated peripheral surface 22 intersects the upper rake surface 46 at a serrated<br>
cutting edge 50. A protrusion 52, which extends downwardly from the intermediate<br>
abutment surface 48, comprises an outer surface 54 extending between the<br>
intermediate abutment surface 48 and a bottom surface 56. The outer surface 54 of<br>
the protrusion 52 has four flat protrusion side surfaces 58 interconnected by<br>
protrusion corners 60. The cutting insert 20 has a centrally disposed through bore<br>
62 extending downwardly from the upper rake surface 46 to the bottom surface 56.<br>
With the protrusion 52 in the recess 34, the cutting insert 20 is secured to the cutting<br>
portion 16 of the cutter body 12 by means of a retaining screw 64 which passes<br>
through the through bore 62 in the cutting insert 20, and threadingly engages the<br>
threaded bore 44 in the recess 34 of the insert pocket 26,<br>
As is best seen in Fig. 8, when the cutting insert 20 is secured in the<br>
recess 34, the intermediate abutment surface 48 of the cutting insert 20 abuts the<br>
support surface 32 of the insert pocket 26 in the cutting portion 16. Since the<br>
serrated peripheral surface 22 of each cutting insert 20 matches and is aligned with<br><br>
WO 2005/009660	PCT/IL2004/000626<br>
-6-<br>
the serrated outer surface 24 of the cutting portion 16 to which it is secured, each<br>
serration crest 22' of the cutting insert 20 is fully supported by a corresponding<br>
serration crest 24' of the support surface 32 of the cutting portion 16. This enhances<br>
the strength, durability and stability of the cutting insert 20.<br>
In order to assure abutment of the intermediate abutment surface 48 of<br>
the cutting insert 20 and the support surface 32 of the insert pocket 26, there is a gap<br>
66 between the bottom surface 56 of the protrusion 52 and the base surface 38 of the<br>
recess 34, when the cutting insert 20 is tightly secured to the insert pocket 26.<br>
As is shown in Fig. 9 the recess 34 has four corners, a rear inner recess<br>
corner 42'r, a rear outer recess corner 42"r, a forward inner recess comer 42'f and a<br>
forward outer recess corner 42"f. With respect to the orientation of the insert<br>
pocket 26 and the cutting insert 20 as shown in Fig. 9, the four recess side surfaces<br>
40 are termed, rear recess side surface 40r, forward recess side surface 40f, inner<br>
recess side surface 40i and outer recess side surface 40o. Similarly, the four<br>
protrusion side surfaces 58 are termed, rear protrusion side surface 58r, forward<br>
protrusion side surface 58f, inner protrusion side surface 58i and outer protrusion<br>
side surface 58o. Due to the fact that the threaded bore 44 is eccentrically disposed<br>
in relation to the geometrical center C of the recess 34, when the cutting insert 20 is<br>
securely retained in the insert pocket 26, it is urged away from the forward outer<br>
recess corner 42"f towards the rear inner recess corner 42'r. Consequently, the pair<br>
of adjacent rear and inner recess side surfaces 40r, 40i is in abutment with,<br>
respectively, the pair of adjacent rear and inner recess side surfaces 58r, 58i. With<br>
this arrangement, the cutting inserts 20 are well supported against cutting forces and<br>
can be accurately secured in the cutting portion 16 of the milling cutter 10. As can<br>
be seen in Fig. 9, a gap exists between the forward recess side surface 40f and the<br>
forward protrusion side surface 58f and between the outer recess side surface 40o<br>
and the outer protrusion side surface 58o. The protrusion corners 60 are either<br>
chamfered, or have a larger radius of curvature than the recess corners 42, so that at<br><br>
WO 2005/009660	PCT/IL2004/000626<br>
-7-<br>
all times a gap exists between each recess comer 42 and each adjacent protrusion<br>
comer 60.<br>
Consecutive cutting portions 16 are slightly rotated around the axis B of<br>
the threaded bore 44, so that the serrations of the serrated outer surface 24 of<br>
consecutive cutting portions 16, together with the serrated peripheral surfaces 22 of<br>
consecutive cutting inserts 20, are offset, or out of phase, in relation to each other in<br>
order to give a better surface finish in comparison to the situation in which there is<br>
no offset.<br>
Although the present invention has been described to a certain degree of<br>
particularity, it should be understood that various alterations and modifications<br>
could be made, such as chip breakers of various designs on the rake surface of the<br>
cutting insert, without departing from the scope of the invention as hereinafter<br>
