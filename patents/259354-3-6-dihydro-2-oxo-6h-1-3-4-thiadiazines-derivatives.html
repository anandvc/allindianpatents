BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention had the object of finding novel compounds having valuable<br>
properties, in particular those which can be used for the preparation of<br>
medicaments.<br>
The present invention relates to compounds and to the use of compounds<br>
in which the inhibition, regulation and/or modulation of signal transduction<br>
by kinases, in particular tyrosine kinases and/or serine/threonine kinases,<br>
plays a role, furthermore to pharmaceutical compositions which comprise<br>
these compounds, and to the use of the compounds for the treatment of<br>
kinase-induced diseases.<br>
In particular, the present invention relates to compounds and to the use of<br>
compounds in which the inhibition, regulation and/or modulation of signal<br>
transduction by Met kinase plays a role.<br>
One of the principal mechanisms by which cellular regulation is effected is<br>
through the transduction of extracellular signals across the membrane that<br>
in turn modulate biochemical pathways within the cell. Protein phosphoryl-<br>
ation represents one course by which intracellular signals are propagated<br>
from molecule to molecule resulting finally in a cellular response. These<br>
signal transduction cascades are highly regulated and often overlap, as is<br>
evident from the existence of many protein kinases as well as phosphata-<br>
ses. Phosphorylation of proteins occurs predominantly at serine, threonine<br>
or tyrosine residues, and protein kinases have therefore been classified by<br>
their specificity of phosphorylation site, i.e. serine/threonine kinases and<br>
tyrosine kinases. Since phosphorylation is such a ubiquitous process<br>
within cells and since cellular phenotypes are largely influenced by the<br>
activity of these pathways, it is currently believed that a number of disease<br><br>
states and/or diseases are attributable to either aberrant activation or<br>
functional mutations in the molecular components of kinase cascades.<br>
Consequently, considerable attention has been devoted to the characteri-<br>
sation of these proteins and compounds that are able to modulate their<br>
activity (for a review see: Weinstein-Oppenheimer et al. Pharma. &amp;.<br>
Therap., 2000, 88, 229-279).<br>
The role of the receptor tyrosine kinase Met in human oncogenesis and<br>
the possibility of inhibition of HGF (hepatocyte growth factor)dependent<br>
Met activation are described by S. Berthou et al. in Oncogene, Vol. 23, No.<br>
31, pages 5387-5393 (2004). The inhibitor SU11274 described therein, a<br>
pyrrole-indoline compound, is potentially suitable for combating cancer.<br>
Another Met kinase inhibitor for cancer therapy is described by J.G.<br>
Christensen et al. in Cancer Res. 2003, 63(21), 7345-55.<br>
A further tyrosine kinase inhibitor for combating cancer is reported by<br>
H. Hov et al. in Clinical Cancer Research Vol. 10, 6686-6694 (2004). The<br>
compound PHA-665752, an indole derivative, is directed against the HGF<br>
receptor c-Met. It is furthermore reported therein that HGF and Met make a<br>
considerable contribution to the malignant process of various forms of<br>
cancer, such as, for example, multiple myeloma.<br>
The synthesis of small compounds which specifically inhibit, regulate<br>
and/or modulate signal transduction by tyrosine kinases and/or serine/-<br>
threonine kinases, in particular Met kinase, is therefore desirable and an<br>
aim of the present invention.<br>
It has been found that the compounds according to the invention and salts<br>
thereof have very valuable pharmacological properties while being well tol-<br>
erated.<br>
The present invention specifically relates to compounds of the formula I<br>
which inhibit, regulate and/or modulate signal transduction by Met kinase,<br><br>
to compositions which comprise these compounds, and to processes for<br>
the use thereof for the treatment of Met kinase-induced diseases and com-<br>
plaints, such as angiogenesis, cancer, tumour formation, growth and<br>
propagation, arteriosclerosis, ocular diseases, such as age-induced<br>
macular degeneration, choroidal neovascularisation and diabetic retino-<br>
pathy, inflammatory diseases, arthritis, thrombosis, fibrosis, glomerulo-<br>
nephritis, neurodegeneration, psoriasis, restenosis, wound healing, trans-<br>
plant rejection, metabolic diseases and diseases of the immune system,<br>
also autoimmune diseases, cirrhosis, diabetes and diseases of the blood<br>
vessels, also instability and permeability and the like in mammals.<br>
Solid tumours, in particular fast-growing tumours, can be treated with Met<br>
kinase inhibitors. These solid tumours include monocytic leukaemia, brain,<br>
urogenital, lymphatic system, stomach, laryngeal and lung carcinoma, in-<br>
cluding lung adenocarcinoma and small-cell lung carcinoma.<br>
The present invention is directed to processes for the regulation, modula-<br>
tion or inhibition of Met kinase for the prevention and/or treatment of dis-<br>
eases in connection with unregulated or disturbed Met kinase activity. In<br>
particular, the compounds of the formula I can also be employed in the<br>
treatment of certain forms of cancer. The compounds of the formula I can<br>
furthermore be used to provide additive or synergistic effects in certain<br>
existing cancer chemotherapies, and/or can be used to restore the efficacy<br>
of certain existing cancer chemotherapies and radiotherapies.<br>
The compounds of the formula I can furthermore be used for the isolation<br>
and investigation of the activity or expression of Met kinase. In addition,<br>
they are particularly suitable for use in diagnostic methods for diseases in<br>
connection with unregulated or disturbed Met kinase activity.<br>
It can be shown that the compounds according to the invention have an<br>
antiproliferative action in vivo in a xenotransplant tumour model. The com-<br><br>
pounds according to the invention are administered to a patient having a<br>
hyperproliferative disease, for example to inhibit tumour growth, to reduce<br>
inflammation associated with a lymphoproliferative disease, to inhibit trans-<br>
plant rejection or neurological damage due to tissue repair, etc. The pre-<br>
sent compounds are suitable for prophylactic or therapeutic purposes. As<br>
used herein, the term "treatment" is used to refer to both prevention of dis-<br>
eases and treatment of pre-existing conditions. The prevention of prolif-<br>
eration is achieved by administration of the compounds according to the<br>
invention prior to the development of overt disease, for example to prevent<br>
the growth of tumours, prevent metastatic growth, diminish restenosis as-<br>
sociated with cardiovascular surgery, etc. Alternatively, the compounds are<br>
used for the treatment of ongoing diseases by stabilising or improving the<br>
clinical symptoms of the patient.<br>
The host or patient can belong to any mammalian species, for example a<br>
primate species, particularly humans; rodents, including mice, rats and<br>
hamsters; rabbits; horses, cows, dogs, cats, etc. Animal models are of in-<br>
terest for experimental investigations, providing a model for treatment of<br>
human disease.<br>
The susceptibility of a particular cell to treatment with the compounds<br>
according to the invention can be determined by in vitro tests. Typically, a<br>
culture of the cell is combined with a compound according to the invention<br>
at various concentrations for a periodine of time which is sufficient to allow<br>
the active agents to induce cell death or to inhibit migration, usually<br>
between about one hour and one week. In vitro testing can be carried out<br>
using cultivated cells from a biopsy sample. The viable cells remaining<br>
after the treatment are then counted.<br>
The dose varies depending on the specific compound used, the specific<br>
disease, the patient status, etc. A therapeutic dose is typically sufficient<br>
considerably to reduce the undesired cell population in the target tissue<br>
while the viability of the patient is maintained. The treatment is generally<br><br>
continued until a considerable reduction has occurred, for example an at<br>
least about 50% reduction in the cell burden, and may be continued until<br>
essentially no more undesired cells are detected in the body.<br>
For identification of a signal transduction pathway and for detection of<br>
interactions between various signal transduction pathways, various scien-<br>
tists have developed suitable models or model systems, for example cell<br>
culture models (for example Khwaja et al., EMBO, 1997, 16, 2783-93) and<br>
models of transgenic animals (for example White et al., Oncogene, 2001,<br>
20, 7064-7072). For the determination of certain stages in the signal trans-<br>
duction cascade, interacting compounds can be utilised in order to modu-<br>
late the signal (for example Stephens et al., Biochemical J., 2000, 351, 95-<br>
105). The compounds according to the invention can also be used as re-<br>
agents for testing kinase-dependent signal transduction pathways in ani-<br>
mals and/or cell culture models or in the clinical diseases mentioned in this<br>
application.<br>
Measurement of the kinase activity is a technique which is well known to<br>
the person skilled in the art. Generic test systems for the determination of<br>
the kinase activity using substrates, for example histone (for example<br>
Alessi et al., FEBS Lett. 1996, 399, 3, pages 333-338) or the basic myelin<br>
protein, are described in the literature (for example Campos-Gonzalez, R.<br>
and Glenney, Jr., J.R. 1992, J. Biol. Chem. 267, page 14535).<br>
For the identification of kinase inhibitors, various assay systems are avail-<br>
able. In scintillation proximity assay (Sorg et al., J. of. Biomolecular<br>
Screening, 2:002, 7, 11-19) and flashplate assay, the radioactive phos-<br>
phorylation of a protein or peptide as substrate with ATP is measured. In<br>
the presence of an inhibitory compound, a decreased radioactive signal, or<br>
none at all, is detectable. Furthermore, homogeneous time-resolved fluo-<br>
rescence resonance energy transfer (HTR-FRET) and fluorescence polari-<br><br>
sation (FP) technologies are suitable as assay methods (Sills et al., J. of<br>
Biomolecular Screening, 2002, 191-214).<br>
Other non-radioactive ELISA assay methods use specific phospho-anti-<br>
bodies (phospho-ABs). The phospho-AB binds only the phosphorylated<br>
substrate. This binding can be detected by chemiluminescence using a<br>
second peroxidase-conjugated anti-sheep antibody (Ross et al., 2002,<br>
Biochem. J.).<br>
There are many diseases associated with deregulation of cellular prolifera-<br>
tion and cell death (apoptosis). The conditions of interest include, but are<br>
not limited to, the following. The compounds according to the invention are<br>
suitable for the treatment of various conditions where there is proliferation<br>
and/or migration of smooth muscle cells and/or inflammatory cells into the<br>
intimal layer of a vessel, resulting in restricted blood flow through that ves-<br>
sel, for example in the case of neointimal occlusive lesions. Occlusive graft<br>
vascular diseases of interest include atherosclerosis, coronary vascular<br>
disease after grafting, vein graft stenosis, peri-anastomatic prosthetic<br>
restenosis, restenosis after angioplasty or stent placement, and the like.<br>

The compounds of the formula I and also the starting materials for their<br>
preparation are, in addition, prepared by methods known per se, as de-<br>
scribed in the literature (for example in the standard works, such as<br>
Houben-Weyl, Methoden der organischen Chemie [Methods of Organic<br>
Chemistry], Georg-Thieme-Verlag, Stuttgart), to be precise under reaction<br>
conditions which are known and suitable for the said reactions. Use can<br>
also be made here of variants known per se which are not mentioned here<br>
in greater detail.<br>
The starting compounds of the formulae la and II are generally known. If<br>
they are novel, however, they can be prepared by methods known per se.<br>
Compounds of the formula I in which B denotes NHCONH(CH2)nR3 can<br>
preferably be obtained by reacting a compound of the formula la with a<br>
coupling reagent selected from the group<br>
a)	isoproylidene chloroformate,<br>
b)	p-nitrophenyl chloroformate,<br>
c)	diphosgene,<br>
d)	triphosgene,<br>
and a compound of the formula II. The reaction is preferably carried out as<br>
a one-pot reaction.<br>
The reaction is generally carried out in an inert solvent.<br>
Depending on the conditions used, the reaction time is between a few<br>
minutes and 14 days, the reaction temperature is between about -15° and<br>
150°, normally between -5° and 90°, particularly preferably between 20°<br>
and 60°C.<br><br>
Examples of suitable inert solvents are hydrocarbons, such as hexane,<br>
petroleum ether, benzene, toluene or xylene; chlorinated hydrocarbons,<br>
such as trichloroethylene, 1,2-dichloroethane, carbon tetrachloride, chlo-<br>
roform or dichloromethane; alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol, isopropa-<br>
nol, n-propanol, n-butanol or tert-butanol; ethers, such as diethyl ether,<br>

ethylene glycol monomethyl or monoethyl ether, ethylene glycol dimethyl<br>
ether (diglyme); ketones, such as acetone or butanone; amides, such as<br>
acetamide, dimethylacetamide or dimethylformamide (DMF); nitrites, such<br>
as acetonitrile; sulfoxides, such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO); carbon di-<br>
sulfide; carboxylic acids, such as formic acid or acetic acid; nitro com-<br>
pounds, such as nitromethane or nitrobenzene; esters, such as ethyl ace-<br>
tate, or mixtures of the said solvents.<br>
Particular preference is given to THF, dichloromethane and/or DMF.<br>
The reaction is generally carried out in the presence of an acid-binding<br>
agent, preferably an organic base, such as DIPEA, triethylamine, di-<br>
methylaniline, pyridine or quinoline.<br>
The addition of an alkali or alkaline-earth metal hydroxide, carbonate or bi-<br>
carbonate or of another salt of a weak acid of the alkali or alkaline-earth<br>
metals, preferably of potassium, sodium, calcium or caesium, may also be<br>
favourable.<br>
Compounds of the formula I in which B denotes NHCOCONH(CH2)nR3 or<br>
NHCOCOO(CH2)nR3 can preferably be obtained by reacting a compound<br>
of the formula la with an alkyl chloroformyl formate, subsequently<br>
hydrolysing the alkyl oxalaminate, and reacting the resultant oxalamic acid<br>
with a compound of the formula II.<br>
An activated ester is advantageously formed in situ here, for example<br>
through addition of HOBt (hydroxybenzotriazole) or N-hydroxysuccinimide.<br>
Radicals of this type for activation of the carboxyl group in typical acylation<br>
reactions are described in the literature (for example in the standard works,<br><br>
such as Houben-Weyl, Methoden der organischen Chemie [Methods of<br>
Organic Chemistry], Georg-Thieme-Verlag, Stuttgart;).<br>
The reaction is carried out in the presence of a carbodiimide, such as, for<br>
example, EDCI (N-ethyl-N,N'-(dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide) or<br>
dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, an organic base, such as, for example, N-<br>
methylmorpholine, and in an inert solvent as indicated above.<br>
Depending on the conditions used, the reaction time is between a few<br>
minutes and 14 days, the reaction temperature is between about -15° and<br>
150°, normally between -5° and 90°, particularly preferably between 20°<br>
and 60°C.<br>
Compounds of the formula I can furthermore be obtained by acylating or<br>
sulfonylating compounds of the formula la. This is carried out under<br>
standard conditions.<br>
The reaction is generally carried out in an inert solvent.<br>
Depending on the conditions used, the reaction time is between a few<br>
minutes and 14 days, the reaction temperature is between about -15° and<br>
150°, normally between -5° and 90°, particularly preferably between 20°<br>
and 60°C.<br>
Suitable inert solvents are those mentioned above.<br>
The reaction is generally carried out in the presence of an acid-binding<br>
agent, preferably an organic base, such as DIPEA, triethylamine, dimethyl-<br>
aniline, pyridine or quinoline.<br>
The addition of an alkali or alkaline-earth metal hydroxide, carbonate or<br>
bicarbonate or of another salt of a weak acid of the alkali or alkaline-earth<br>
metals, preferably of potassium, sodium, calcium or caesium, may also be<br>
favourable.<br>
Pharmaceutical salts and other forms<br>
The said compounds according to the invention can be used in their final<br>
non-salt form. On the other hand, the present invention also encompasses<br>
the use of these compounds in the form of their pharmaceutically accept-<br><br>
able salts, which can be derived from various organic and inorganic acids<br>
and bases by procedures known in the art. Pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
salt forms of the compounds of the formula I are for the most part prepared<br>
by conventional methods. If the compound of the formula I contains a car-<br>
boxyl group, one of its suitable salts can be formed by reacting the com-<br>
pound with a suitable base to give the corresponding base-addition salt.<br>
Such bases are, for example, alkali metal hydroxides, including potassium<br>
hydroxide, sodium hydroxide and lithium hydroxide; alkaline-earth metal<br>
hydroxides, such as barium hydroxide and calcium hydroxide; alkali metal<br>
alkoxides, for example potassium ethoxide and sodium propoxide; and<br>
various organic bases, such as piperidine, diethanolamine and N-methyl-<br>
glutamine. The aluminium salts of the compounds of the formula I are like-<br>
wise included. In the case of certain compounds of the formula I, acid-<br>
addition salts can be formed by treating these compounds with pharma-<br>
ceutically acceptable organic and inorganic acids, for example hydrogen<br>
halides, such as hydrogen chloride, hydrogen bromide or hydrogen iodide,<br>
other mineral acids and corresponding salts thereof, such as sulfate,<br>
nitrate or phosphate and the like, and alkyl- and monoarylsulfonates, such<br>
as ethanesulfonate, toluenesulfonate and benzenesulfonate, and other<br>
organic acids and corresponding salts thereof, such as acetate, trifluoro-<br>
acetate, tartrate, maleate, succinate, citrate, benzoate, salicylate, ascor-<br>
bate and the like. Accordingly, pharmaceutically acceptable acid-addition<br>
salts of the compounds of the formula I include the following: acetate, adi-<br>
pate, alginate, arginate, aspartate, benzoate, benzenesulfonate (besylate),<br>
bisulfate, bisulfite, bromide, butyrate, camphorate, camphorsulfonate,<br>
caprylate, chloride, chlorobenzoate, citrate, cyclopentanepropionate, diglu-<br>
conate, dihydrogenphosphate, dinitrobenzoate, dodecylsulfate, ethane-<br>
sulfonate, fumarate, galacterate (from mucic acid), galacturonate, gluco-<br>
heptanoate, gluconate, glutamate, glycerophosphate, hemisuccinate,<br>
hemisulfate, heptanoate, hexanoate, hippurate, hydrochloride, hydro-<br>
bromide, hydroiodide, 2-hydroxyethanesulfonate, iodide, isethionate, iso-<br>
butyrate, lactate, lactobionate, malate, maleate, malonate, mandelate,<br><br>
metaphosphate, methanesulfonate, methylbenzoate, monohydrogenphos-<br>
phate, 2-naphthalenesulfonate, nicotinate, nitrate, oxalate, oleate, palmo-<br>
ate, pectinate, persulfate, phenylacetate, 3-phenylpropionate, phosphate,<br>
phosphonate, phthalate, but this does not represent a restriction.<br>
Furthermore, the base salts of the compounds according to the invention<br>
include aluminium, ammonium, calcium, copper, iron(lll), iron(ll), lithium,<br>
magnesium, nnanganese(lll), manganese(ll), potassium, sodium and zinc<br>
salts, but this is not intended to represent a restriction. Of the above-men-<br>
tioned salts, preference is given to ammonium; the alkali metal salts<br>
sodium and potassium, and the alkaline-earth metal salts calcium and<br>
magnesium. Salts of the compounds of the formula I which are derived<br>
from pharmaceutically acceptable organic non-toxic bases include salts of<br>
primary, secondary and tertiary amines, substituted amines, also including<br>
naturally occurring substituted amines, cyclic amines, and basic ion ex-<br>
changer resins, for example arginine, betaine, caffeine, chloroprocaine,<br>
choline, N,N'-dibenzylethylenediamine (benzathine), dicyclohexylamine,<br>
diethanolamine, diethylamine, 2-diethylaminoethanol, 2-dimethylamino-<br>
ethanol, ethanolamine, ethylenediamine, N-ethylmorpholine, N-ethylpipe-<br>
ridine, glucamine, glucosamine, histidine, hydrabamine, isopropylamine,<br>
lidocaine, lysine, meglumine, N-methyl-D-glucamine, morpholine, pipera-<br>
zine, piperidine, polyamine resins, procaine, purines, theobromine, tri-<br>
ethanolamine, triethylamine, trimethylamine, tripropylamine and tris-<br>
(hydroxymethyl)methylamine (tromethamine), but this is not intended to<br>
represent a restriction.<br>
Compounds of the present invention which contain basic nitrogen-contain-<br>
ing groups can be quaternised using agents such as (C1-C4)alkyl halides,<br>
for example methyl, ethyl, isopropyl and tert-butyl chloride, bromide and<br>
iodide; di(C1-C4)alkyl sulfates, for example dimethyl, diethyl and diamyl<br>
sulfate; (C10-C18)alkyl halides, for example decyl, dodecyl, lauryl, myristyl<br>
and stearyl chloride, bromide and iodide; and aryl(C1-C4)alkyl halides, for<br><br>
example benzyl chloride and phenethyl bromide. Both water- and oil-solu-<br>
ble compounds according to the invention can be prepared using such<br>
salts.<br>
The above-mentioned pharmaceutical salts which are preferred include<br>
acetate, trifluoroacetate, besylate, citrate, fumarate, gluconate, hemisucci-<br>
nate, hippurate, hydrochloride, hydrobromide, isethionate, mandelate, me-<br>
glumine, nitrate, oleate, phosphonate, pivalate, sodium phosphate, stea-<br>
rate, sulfate, sulfosalicylate, tartrate, thiomalate, tosylate and trometh-<br>
amine, but this is not intended to represent a restriction.<br>
The acid-addition salts of basic compounds of the formula I are prepared<br>
by bringing the free base form into contact with a sufficient amount of the<br>
desired acid, causing the formation of the salt in a conventional manner.<br>
The free base can be regenerated by bringing the salt form into contact<br>
with a base and isolating the free base in a conventional manner. The free<br>
base forms differ in a certain respect from the corresponding salt forms<br>
thereof with respect to certain physical properties, such as solubility in<br>
polar solvents; for the purposes of the invention, however, the salts other-<br>
wise correspond to the respective free base forms thereof.<br>
As mentioned, the pharmaceutically acceptable base-addition salts of the<br>
compounds of the formula I are formed with metals or amines, such as<br>
alkali metals and alkaline-earth metals or organic amines. Preferred metals<br>
are sodium, potassium, magnesium and calcium. Preferred organic<br>
amines are N,N'-dibenzylethylenediamine, chloroprocaine, choline, di-<br>
ethanolamine, ethylenediamine, N-methyl-D-glucamine and procaine.<br>
The base-addition salts of acidic compounds according to the invention are<br>
prepared by bringing the free acid form into contact with a sufficient<br>
amount of the desired base, causing the formation of the salt in a conven-<br>
tional manner. The free acid can be regenerated by bringing the salt form<br><br>
into contact with an acid and isolating the free acid in a conventional man-<br>
ner. The free acid forms differ in a certain respect from the corresponding<br>
salt forms thereof with respect to certain physical properties, such as solu-<br>
bility in polar solvents; for the purposes of the invention, however, the salts<br>
otherwise correspond to the respective free acid forms thereof.<br>
If a compound according to the invention contains more than one group<br>
which is capable of forming pharmaceutically acceptable salts of this type,<br>
the invention also encompasses multiple salts. Typical multiple salt forms<br>
include, for example, bitartrate, diacetate, difumarate, dimeglumine, di-<br>
phosphate, disodium and trihydrochloride, but this is not intended to repre-<br>
sent a restriction.<br>
With regard to that stated above, it can be seen that the expression "phar-<br>
maceutically acceptable salt" in the present connection is taken to mean<br>
an active ingredient which comprises a compound of the formula I in the<br>
form of one of its salts, in particular if this salt form imparts improved<br>
pharmacokinetic properties on the active ingredient compared with the free<br>
form of the active ingredient or any other salt form of the active ingredient<br>
used earlier. The pharmaceutically acceptable salt form of the active<br>
ingredient can also provide this active ingredient for the first time with a<br>
desired pharmacokinetic property which it did not have earlier and can<br>
even have a positive influence on the pharmacodynamics of this active<br>
ingredient with respect to its therapeutic efficacy in the body.<br>
The invention furthermore relates to medicaments comprising at least one<br>
compound of the formula I and/or pharmaceutically usable derivatives, sol-<br>
vates and stereoisomers thereof, including mixtures thereof in all ratios,<br>
and optionally excipients and/or adjuvants.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations can be administered in the form of dosage<br>
units which comprise a predetermined amount of active ingredient per<br><br>
dosage unit. Such a unit can comprise, for example, 0.5 mg to 1 g, prefer-<br>
ably 1 mg to 700 mg, particularly preferably 5 mg to 100 mg, of a com-<br>
pound according to the invention, depending on the condition treated, the<br>
method of administration and the age, weight and condition of the patient,<br>
or pharmaceutical formulations can be administered in the form of dosage<br>
units which comprise a predetermined amount of active ingredient per<br>
dosage unit. Preferred dosage unit formulations are those which comprise<br>
a daily dose or part-dose, as indicated above, or a corresponding fraction<br>
thereof of an active ingredient. Furthermore, pharmaceutical formulations<br>
of this type can be prepared using a process which is generally known in<br>
the pharmaceutical art.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations can be adapted for administration via any<br>
desired suitable method, for example by oral (including buccal or sublin-<br>
gual), rectal, nasal, topical (including buccal, sublingual or transdermal),<br>
vaginal or parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous<br>
or intradermal) methods. Such formulations can be prepared using all<br>
processes known in the pharmaceutical art by, for example, combining the<br>
active ingredient with the excipient(s) or adjuvant(s).<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for oral administration can be ad-<br>
ministered as separate units, such as, for example, capsules or tablets;<br>
powders or granules; solutions or suspensions in aqueous or non-aqueous<br>
liquids; edible foams or foam foods; or oil-in-water liquid emulsions or<br>
water-in-oil liquid emulsions.<br>
Thus, for example, in the case of oral administration in the form of a tablet<br>
or capsule, the active-ingredient component can be combined with an oral,<br>
non-toxic and pharmaceutically acceptable inert excipient, such as, for<br>
example, ethanol, glycerol, water and the like. Powders are prepared by<br>
comminuting the compound to a suitable fine size and mixing it with a<br>
pharmaceutical excipient comminuted in a similar manner, such as, for<br><br>
example, an edible carbohydrate, such as, for example, starch or mannitol.<br>
A flavour, preservative, dispersant and dye may likewise be present.<br>
Capsules are produced by preparing a powder mixture as described above<br>
and filling shaped gelatine shells therewith. Glidants and lubricants, such<br>
as, for example, highly disperse silicic acid, talc, magnesium stearate, cal-<br>
cium stearate or polyethylene glycol in solid form, can be added to the<br>
powder mixture before the filling operation. A disintegrant or solubiliser,<br>
such as, for example, agar-agar, calcium carbonate or sodium carbonate,<br>
may likewise be added in order to improve the availability of the medica-<br>
ment after the capsule has been taken.<br>
In addition, if desired or necessary, suitable binders, lubricants and disin-<br>
tegrants as well as dyes can likewise be incorporated into the mixture.<br>
Suitable binders include starch, gelatine, natural sugars, such as, for<br>
example, glucose or beta-lactose, sweeteners made from maize, natural<br>
and synthetic rubber, such as, for example, acacia, tragacanth or sodium<br>
alginate, carboxymethylcellulose, polyethylene glycol, waxes, and the like.<br>
The lubricants used in these dosage forms include sodium oleate, sodium<br>
stearate, magnesium stearate, sodium benzoate, sodium acetate, sodium<br>
chloride and the like. The disintegrants include, without being restricted<br>
thereto, starch, methylcellulose, agar, bentonite, xanthan gum and the like.<br>
The tablets are formulated by, for example, preparing a powder mixture,<br>
granulating or dry-pressing the mixture, adding a lubricant and a disinteg-<br>
rant and pressing the entire mixture to give tablets. A powder mixture is<br>
prepared by mixing the compound comminuted in a suitable manner with a<br>
diluent or a base, as described above, and optionally with a binder, such<br>
as, for example, carboxymethylcellulose, an alginate, gelatine or polyvinyl-<br>
pyrrolidone, a dissolution retardant, such as, for example, paraffin, an ab-<br>
sorption accelerator, such as, for example, a quaternary salt, and/or an<br>
absorbant, such as, for example, bentonite, kaolin or dicalcium phosphate.<br>
The powder mixture can be granulated by wetting it with a binder, such as,<br><br>
for example, syrup, starch paste, acadia mucilage or solutions of cellulose<br>
or polymer materials and pressing it through a sieve. As an alternative to<br>
granulation, the powder mixture can be run through a tabletting machine,<br>
giving lumps of non-uniform shape, which are broken up to form granules.<br>
The granules can be lubricated by addition of stearic acid, a stearate salt,<br>
talc or mineral oil in order to prevent sticking to the tablet casting moulds.<br>
The lubricated mixture is then pressed to give tablets. The compounds<br>
according to the invention can also be combined with a free-flowing inert<br>
excipient and then pressed directly to give tablets without carrying out the<br>
granulation or dry-pressing steps. A transparent or opaque protective layer<br>
consisting of a shellac sealing layer, a layer of sugar or polymer material<br>
and a gloss layer of wax may be present. Dyes can be added to these<br>
coatings in order to be able to differentiate between different dosage units.<br>
Oral liquids, such as, for example, solution, syrups and elixirs, can be pre-<br>
pared in the form of dosage units so that a given quantity comprises a pre-<br>
specified amount of the compound. Syrups can be prepared by dissolving<br>
the compound in an aqueous solution with a suitable flavour, while elixirs<br>
are prepared using a non-toxic alcoholic vehicle. Suspensions can be for-<br>
mulated by dispersion of the compound in a non-toxic vehicle. Solubilisers<br>
and emulsifiers, such as, for example, ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols and<br>
polyoxyethylene sorbitol ethers, preservatives, flavour additives, such as,<br>
for example, peppermint oil or natural sweeteners or saccharin, or other<br>
artificial sweeteners and the like, can likewise be added.<br>
The dosage unit formulations for oral administration can, if desired, be en-<br>
capsulated in microcapsules. The formulation can also be prepared in<br>
such a way that the release is extended or retarded, such as, for example,<br>
by coating or embedding of particulate material in polymers, wax and the<br>
like.<br><br>
The compounds of the formula I and salts, solvates and physiologically<br>
functional derivatives thereof can also be administered in the form of lipo-<br>
some delivery systems, such as, for example, small unilamellar vesicles,<br>
large unilamellar vesicles and multilamellar vesicles. Liposomes can be<br>
formed from various phospholipids, such as, for example, cholesterol,<br>
stearylamine or phosphatidylcholines.<br>
The compounds of the formula I and the salts, solvates and physiologically<br>
functional derivatives thereof can also be delivered using monoclonal anti-<br>
bodies as individual carriers to which the compound molecules are cou-<br>
pled. The compounds can also be coupled to soluble polymers as targeted<br>
medicament carriers. Such polymers may encompass polyvinylpyrrolidone,<br>
pyran copolymer, polyhydroxypropylmethacrylamidophenol, polyhydroxy-<br>
ethylaspartamidophenol or polyethylene oxide polylysine, substituted by<br>
palmitoyl radicals. The compounds may furthermore be coupled to a class<br>
of biodegradable polymers which are suitable for achieving controlled<br>
release of a medicament, for example polylactic acid, poly-epsilon-capro-<br>
lactone, polyhydroxybutyric acid, polyorthoesters, polyacetals, polydihy-<br>
droxypyrans, polycyanoacrylates and crosslinked or amphipathic block co-<br>
polymers of hydrogels.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for transdermal administration can<br>
be administered as independent plasters for extended, close contact with<br>
the epidermis of the recipient. Thus, for example, the active ingredient can<br>
be delivered from the plaster by iontophoresis, as described in general<br>
terms in Pharmaceutical Research, 3(6), 318 (1986).<br>
Pharmaceutical compounds adapted for topical administration can be for-<br>
mulated as ointments, creams, suspensions, lotions, powders, solutions,<br>
pastes, gels, sprays, aerosols or oils.<br><br>
For the treatment of the eye or other external tissue, for example mouth<br>
and skin, the formulations are preferably applied as topical ointment or<br>
cream. In the case of formulation to give an ointment, the active ingredient<br>
can be employed either with a paraffinic or a water-miscible cream base.<br>
Alternatively, the active ingredient can be formulated to give a cream with<br>
an oil-in-water cream base or a water-in-oil base.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for topical application to the eye<br>
include eye drops, in which the active ingredient is dissolved or suspended<br>
in a suitable carrier, in particular an aqueous solvent.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for topical application in the mouth<br>
encompass lozenges, pastilles and mouthwashes.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for rectal administration can be ad-<br>
ministered in the form of suppositories or enemas.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for nasal administration in which the<br>
carrier substance is a solid comprise a coarse powder having a particle<br>
size, for example, in the range 20-500 microns, which is administered in<br>
the manner in which snuff is taken, i.e. by rapid inhalation via the nasal<br>
passages from a container containing the powder held close to the nose.<br>
Suitable formulations for administration as nasal spray or nose drops with<br>
a liquid as carrier substance encompass active-ingredient solutions in<br>
water or oil.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for administration by inhalation en-<br>
compass finely particulate dusts or mists, which can be generated by vari-<br>
ous types of pressurised dispensers with aerosols, nebulisers or insuffla-<br>
tors.<br><br>
Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for vaginal administration can be<br>
administered as pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or spray<br>
formulations.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for parenteral administration include<br>
aqueous and non-aqueous sterile injection solutions comprising antioxi-<br>
dants, buffers, bacteriostatics and solutes, by means of which the formula-<br>
tion is rendered isotonic with the blood of the recipient to be treated; and<br>
aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions, which may comprise sus-<br>
pension media and thickeners. The formulations can be administered in<br>
single-dose or multidose containers, for example sealed ampoules and<br>
vials, and stored in freeze-dried (lyophilised) state, so that only the addition<br>
of the sterile carrier liquid, for example water for injection purposes, imme-<br>
diately before use is necessary. Injection solutions and suspensions pre-<br>
pared in accordance with the recipe can be prepared from sterile powders,<br>
granules and tablets.<br>
It goes without saying that, in addition to the above particularly mentioned<br>
constituents, the formulations may also comprise other agents usual in the<br>
art with respect to the particular type of formulation; thus, for example, for-<br>
mulations which are suitable for oral administration may comprise flavours.<br>
A therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the formula I depends<br>
on a number of factors, including, for example, the age and weight of the<br>
animal, the precise condition that requires treatment, and its severity, the<br>
nature of the formulation and the method of administration, and is ultimate-<br>
ly determined by the treating doctor or vet. However, an effective amount<br>
of a compound according to the invention for the treatment of neoplastic<br>
growth, for example colon or breast carcinoma, is generally in the range<br>
from 0.1 to 100 mg/kg of body weight of the recipient (mammal) per day<br>
and particularly typically in the range from 1 to 10 mg/kg of body weight<br>
per day. Thus, the actual amount per day for an adult mammal weighing<br><br>
70 kg is usually between 70 and 700 mg, where this amount can be<br>
administered as a single dose per day or usually in a series of part-doses<br>
(such as, for example, two, three, four, five or six) per day, so that the total<br>
daily dose is the same. An effective amount of a salt or solvate or of a<br>
physiologically functional derivative thereof can be determined as the frac-<br>
tion of the effective amount of the compound according to the invention<br>
per se. It can be assumed that similar doses are suitable for the treatment<br>
of other conditions mentioned above.<br>
The invention furthermore relates to medicaments comprising at least one<br>
compound of the formula I and/or pharmaceutically usable derivatives, sol-<br>
vates and stereoisomers thereof, including mixtures thereof in all ratios,<br>
and at least one further medicament active ingredient.<br>
The invention also relates to a set (kit) consisting of separate packs of<br>
(a)	an effective amount of a compound of the formula I and/or pharma-<br>
ceutically usable derivatives, solvates and stereoisomers thereof, in-<br>
cluding mixtures thereof in all ratios,<br>
and<br>
(b)	an effective amount of a further medicament active ingredient.<br>
The set comprises suitable containers, such as boxes, individual bottles,<br>
bags or ampoules. The set may, for example, comprise separate am-<br>
poules, each containing an effective amount of a compound of the formula<br>
I and/or pharmaceutically usable derivatives, solvates and stereoisomers<br>
thereof, including mixtures thereof in all ratios,<br>
and an effective amount of a further medicament active ingredient in dis-<br>
solved or lyophilised form.<br><br>
USE<br>
The present compounds are suitable as pharmaceutical active ingredients<br>
for mammals, especially for humans, in the treatment of tyrosine kinase-<br>
induced diseases. These diseases include the proliferation of tumour cells,<br>
pathological neovascularisation (or angiogenesis) which promotes the<br>
growth of solid tumours, ocular neovascularisation (diabetic retinopathy,<br>
age-induced macular degeneration and the like) and inflammation (psoria-<br>
sis, rheumatoid arthritis and the like).<br>
The present invention encompasses the use of the compounds of the for-<br>
mula I and/or physiologically acceptable salts and solvates thereof for the<br>
preparation of a medicament for the treatment or prevention of cancer.<br>
Preferred carcinomas for the treatment originate from the group cerebral<br>
carcinoma, urogenital tract carcinoma, carcinoma of the lymphatic system,<br>

ASSAYS<br>
The compounds of the formula I described in the examples were tested by<br>
the assays described below and were found to have kinase inhibitory<br>
activity. Other assays are known from the literature and could readily be<br>
performed by the person skilled in the art (see, for example, Dhanabal et<br>
al., Cancer Res. 59:189-197; Xin et al., J. Biol. Chem. 274:9116-9121;<br>
Sheu et al., Anticancer Res. 18:4435-4441; Ausprunk et al., Dev. Biol.<br>
38:237-248; Gimbrone et al., J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 52:413-427; Nicosia et<br>
al., In Vitro 18:538- 549).<br>
Measurement of Met kinase activity<br>
According to the manufacturer's data (Met, active, upstate, catalogue No.<br>
14-526), Met kinase is expressed for the purposes of protein production in<br>
insect cells (Sf21; S. frugiperda) and subsequent affinity-chromatographic<br><br>
purification as "N-temninal 6His-tagged" recombinant human protein in a<br>
baculovirus expression vector.<br>
The kinase activity can be measured using various available measurement<br>
systems. In the scintillation proximity method (Sorg et al., J. of Biomolecu-<br>
lar Screening, 2002, 7, 11-19), the flashplate method or the filter binding<br>
test, the radioactive phosphorylation of a protein or peptide as substrate is<br>
measured using radioactively labelled ATP (32P-ATP, 33P-ATP). In the<br>
case of the presence of an inhibitory compound, a reduced radioactive<br>
signal, or none at all, can be detected. Furthermore, homogeneous time-<br>
resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (HTR-FRET) and<br>
fluoroescence polarisation (FP) technologies can be used as assay meth-<br>
ods (Sills et al., J. of Biomolecular Screening, 2002, 191-214).<br>
Other non-radioactive ELISA assay methods use specific phospho-anti-<br>
bodies (phospho-ABs). The phospho-antibody only binds the phosphor-<br>
ylated substrate. This binding can be detected by chemiluminescence<br>
using a second peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Ross et al., 2002, Bio-<br>
chem. J.).<br>
Flashplate method (Met kinase)<br>
The test plates used are 96-well FlashplateR microtitre plates from Perkin<br>
Elmer (Cat. No. SMP200). The components of the kinase reaction de-<br>
scribed below are pipetted into the assay plate. The Met kinase and the<br>
substrate poly Ala-Glu-Lys-Tyr, (pAGLT, 6:2:5:1), are incubated for 3 hrs at<br>
room temperature with radioactively labelled 33P-ATP in the presence and<br>
absence of test substances in a total volume of 100 l. The reaction is<br>
terminated using 150 l of a 60 mM EDTA solution. After incubation for a<br>
further 30 min at room temperature, the supernatants are filtered off with<br>
suction, and the wells are washed three times with 200 l of 0.9% NaCI<br>
solution each time. The measurement of the bound radioactivity is carried<br><br>
out by means of a scintillation measuring instrument (Topcount NXT,<br>
Perkin-Elmer).<br>
The full value used is the inhibitor-free kinase reaction. This should be ap-<br>
proximately in the range 6000-9000 cpm. The pharmacological zero value<br>
used is staurosporin in a final concentration of 0.1 mM. The inhibitory<br>
values (IC50) are determined using the RS1_MTS program.<br>

If the requisite haloacetophenones are not commercially available, they<br>
can be prepared analogously to the following synthetic procedure:<br>
5.57 g of 3,4-dimethoxyacetophenone are dissolved in 60 ml of diethyl<br>
ether and 30 ml of 1,4-dioxane in a 250 ml three-necked flask provided<br>
with magnetic stirrer, condenser, thermometer, dropping funnel with pres-<br>
sure equalisation and drying tube, and 1.54 ml of bromine are added<br>

precipitate re-dissolves, the temperature is raised by about 3°C, and a<br>
pale-yellow, clear solution forms. This is poured onto ice, stirred well, and<br><br>
the precipitate formed between the phases is filtered off with suction. It is<br>
washed with water and then with a little MTB ether and dried (=K1). The<br>
mother liquor is extracted with MTB ether, dried, filtered and evaporated to<br>
