PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATION FOR THE TREATMENT OF BACTERIAL AND PARASITIC INFECTIONS;<br>
BIOAGENCY AG A COMPANY ORGANISED AND EXISTING UNDER THE LAWS OF GERMANY WHOSE ADDRESS IS SCHNACKENBURGALLEE 116A, 22525 HAMBURG, GERMANY.<br>
THE	FOLLOWING	SPECIFICATION<br>
PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br><br><br>
The present invention relates to pharmaceutical preparations comprising 3-N-formyl hydroxy amino propyl phosphonic acid de- • rivatives or 3-N-acetyl hydroxy amino propyl phosphonic acid derivatives as active ingredients in combination with special pharmaceutical active ingredients:<br>
The use of 3-N-formyl hydroxy amino propyl phosphonic acid de-rivatives and 3-N-acetyl hydroxy amino propyl phosphonic acid derivatives for prophylactic and therapeutic treatment of in-fectious processes, especially infections caused by unicellu-lar parasites (with the meaning of this invention: protozoa) or multicellular parasites, is already known from DE-A1-198 25 585. A bacterial activity has already been described in DE-A1-27 33 658. Even if these compounds exhibit good results in the treatment of infections caused by parasites or bacteria, also these medicaments exhibit undesired side-effects.<br>
Therefore, the present invention made it its object to enhance activity of these pharmaceutical preparations without increas-ing the side-effects of these active ingredients. Pharmaceuti-cal preparations shall be made available providing a reduction of side-effects. The object is as well to widen the range of therapeutic application of said pharmaceutical preparations and especially also to extend it to the treatment of problem-atic groups such as children, and pregnant women. The antipara-sitic activity shall be increased to such a degree such that these pharmaceutical preparations may be administered in lower doses and, thus, a reduction or elimination of side effects caused by these preparations is achieved.<br><br>
Surprisingly, it has been found that 3-N-formyl hydroxy amino propyl phosphonic acid derivatives and 3-N-acetyl hydroxy amino propyl phosphonic acid derivatives in combination with a further pharmaceutical preparation being selected from the group .consisting of clindamycin, lincomycin, mirincamycin, pirlimycin and other lincosamides; minocycline and other tet¬racycline derivatives, azithromycin, erythromycin, spiramycin, josamycin, roxithromycin, clarithromycin, midecaraycin and other macrolide antibiotics, tiamuline, rifampicin, clotrim¬azole, flutrimazole, ketoconazole, tebuconazole, miconazole, itraconazole, fluconazole and other azole antimycotics; cipro¬floxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin and other inhibitors of pro-karyotic gyrase, nitrofurantoin, ornidazole, tinidazole, ni-morazole and other nitroimidazole derivatives; disulfiram and other dithiocarbamates; lumefantrine, tafenoquine (WR238,605), pyronaridine, dihydroartemisinin, artemether, arteether, arte-sunate, isoniazid, chlorproguanil, trimethoprim and tetroxo-prim, a significant higher therapeutic efficiency than in monotherapy. These combination preparations are especially suited for treatment of Malaria.<br>
According to the present invention 3-N-formyl-hydroxy amino propyl phosphonic acid derivatives and 3-N-acetyl hydroxy amino propyl phosphonic acid derivatives are deeemed to be compounds of formula (I)<br>
  (I)<br>
wherein Rx is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen<br>
and methyl,<br>
and<br>
wherein R2 and R3 are independently selected from the group,<br>
consisting of hydrogen, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl,<br>
substituted or unsubstituted acyl, substituted or unsubsti-<br><br>
tuted aryl, substituted or unsubstituted aralkyl, substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted si-lyl, substituted or unsubstituted heterocyclic residue, or to-gether form a substituted or unsubstituted C1-5-alkyl chain, the alkyl groups being saturated or comprising one or more double bonds or triple bonds.<br>
Lumefantrine, tafenoquine (WR238,605), pyronaridine, dihydro-artemisinin, artemether, arteether, artesunate, clindamycin and azithromycin are especially preferred for the second phar¬maceutical agent in the treatment of parasitic infections.<br>
Clindamycin and azithromycin are especially preferred in the treatment of bacterial as well as parasitic infections. The combination preparation of clindamycin or azithromycin is es¬pecially suited for the treatment of infections caused by Helicobacter pylori.<br>
The combination preparations are also deemed to be the respec¬tive salts, such as especially a fosmidomycin clindamycin salt and salts of other lincosamides.<br>
Special features of the above definitions and suitable exam¬ples thereof are stated below:<br>
"Acyl" is a substituent which originates from an acid, such as from an organic carboxylic acid, carbonic acid, carbamic acid or the thioacid or imidic acid corresponding to the individual above-stated acids, or from an organic sulfonic acid, wherein these acids may in each case comprise aliphatic, aromatic and/or heterocyclic groups in the molecule, as well as car¬bamoyl or carbamimidoyl.<br>
Suitable examples of these acyl groups are stated below.<br>
Aliphatic acyl groups are deemed to comprise acyl residues originating from an aliphatic acid, such groups including the<br><br>
following:<br>

The use of combination therapy with the help of pharmaceutical preparations of the present invention has the advantage of a synergistic increase of antiparasitic activity of the single substances. Hence, in combining the single compounds, there is a possibility of reducing the doses and, thus, the toxicity of the single compounds at the same time preserving antiparasitic activity. A combination therapy of the above listed principles<br><br>
of therapy of the individual coumpunds further provides the possibility of overcoming resistance.<br>
With the use of said combination therapy it is possible to ad¬minister the active agents in a so-called fixed combination, i.e. in a single pharmaceutical formulation containing both the active agents or to choose a so-called free combination, administering the active agents in form of separate pharmaceu¬tical formulations at the same time or one after the other.<br>
If the active agents are solid materials, the active agents may be administered by conventional methods for solid drug preparations mixing e.g. both active agents and pelletizing them for example into pellets together with conventional ex-cipients or auxiliary materials. However, it is also possible to provide the active agents separately in one package unit ready for sale wherein the package unit contains both active agents in separate pharmaceutical formulations.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations may be administered in liquid or solid form for enteral or parenteral application. In this connection all conventional forms of application are possible, for example pellets, capsules, dragees, sirups, solutions, suspensions. Preferably, water is used as an injection medium containing added substances common in injection solutions such as stabilizers, dissolving intermediaries and buffers. If de¬sired, preparations suited for oral application may contain flavorings or sweeteners.<br>
The following example states the favourable activity of some representative combination preparations.<br>
The sensitivity of Plasmodium falciparum in view of fosmidomy-cin in combination with different compounds has been deter-<br><br>
mined in a semi-automatic test  eystem by the incorporation of [3H]-hypoxanthin into the DNA of parasites. The IC50-values of fosmidomycin and the respective combination partner were de-termined for the single compounds and in different ratios of mixture on microtitreplates. The results were defined as sum of fractional inhibitory concentration (sum fractional inhibi-tory concentration, FIC):<br>
sum FIC = IC50 of fosmidomycin in mixture/IC50 of fosmidomycin alone + IC 50 of the combination partners in mix-ture/IC50 of combination partner alone<br>
Sum FlC-values  l antargonism and values = 1 addition. It has to be considered that also slightly antargonistic combinations may be therapeutically valuable (sum FIC 
The following sum FIC-values have been measured on Plasmodium falciparum strains Dd2, 3D7 and HB3:<br>
	drug	P. falciparum strain	sum FIC	<br>
Dd2 0,42<br>
clindamycin 3D7 0,40<br>
	HB3	0,37	<br>
Dd2 0,86<br>
azithromycin 3D7 0,74<br>
	HB3	0,85	<br>
Dd2	1,20<br>
lumefantrin        HB3	1,08<br>
