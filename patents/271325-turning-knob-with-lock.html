Turning knob with lock<br>
The present invention pertains to a turning knob with lock comprising a body in which are housed a stator, a barrel or rotor controlled by a key and a control component able to switch contacts of an electrical block.<br>
A turning knob with lock is used to establish prolonged or fleeting electrical contact in order to activate a process. In the case where electrical contact is prolonged, the turning knob comprises several positions and will be able to permit one or more key withdrawals. On the other hand in the case where electrical contact is fleeting, the turning knob generally permits only a single key withdrawal.<br>
When the turning knob with lock is of the positions type and if it permits several key withdrawals, it may be necessary to be able to offer the client identical knobs in which key withdrawals do not all occur in the same position. In order to decrease manufacturing costs and to limit difficulties during assembly, it may turn out to be beneficial to use one and the same stator to obtain various combinations of key withdrawals.<br>
The aim of the invention is therefore to offer a turning knob with lock in which it is possible to obtain, on the basis of one and the same stator, various combinations of key withdrawals.<br>
This aim is achieved by a turning knob with lock for electrical circuit comprising a body able to house a barrel turning with respect to a stator, said barrel comprising tabs, receiving a key that can take by rotation at least two functional positions, held or fleeting, and exhibiting at one of its ends a shank<br><br>
ictuatable by rotation of said key.  Said knob is characterized in that,<br>
-	the body exhibits an internal cylindrical sleeve<br>
on which the stator positions itself,<br>
-	the internal sleeve exhibits a plurality of<br>
-dentical positioning members for the stator, each<br>
bositioning member of the internal sleeve being<br>
complementary to a corresponding positioning member of<br>
the stator, so as to be able to choose the position of<br>
the stator with respect to the body.<br>
According to the invention, it is therefore possible to choose the position of the stator in the body, therefore the position of the lateral opening of the stator with respect to the body and the one in which the key may be withdrawn. The members for positioning the sleeve and stator are complementary and comprise for example identical notches formed on a flange of one of the ends of the internal sleeve and a grown of complementary flutes formed at an end of the itator. The notches at the end of the sleeve therefore tlot into the corresponding flutes of the stator.<br>
According to a first embodiment, the stator exhibits two diametrically opposite lateral openings.<br>
According to a second embodiment, the stator exhibits six diametrically opposite lateral openings.<br>
In a knob turning by a quarter turn, it is herefore possible to obtain on the basis of these two etator embodiments, one, two or three key withdrawals Lt various positions and to offer all the combinations of key withdrawals.<br>
According to a feature, the body of the knob exhibits  a  flared part  furnished with  an  external<br><br>
collar, a cup defined between said collar and the internal sleeve being able to receive a helical spring 1oading a s ensitivity ring that can move in translation.<br>
According to another feature, the knob also comprises a lock-cover housed in the body and secured to the barrel, said lock-cover exhibiting teeth able to cooperate wi th cam shapes formed on the s ens i tivi ty ring.<br>
According to another feature, the sensitivity ring is able to be temporarily linked to the stator by way of intermeshing means. Such a characteristic makes it possible to facilitate assembly of the knob in particular when the latter is achieved in an automatic manner with the aid of machines.<br>
According to another feature, the intermeshing means comprise at least two studs formed on the lateral wall of the stator and the ring is held bearing against a shoulder formed on the stator by way of the studs bearing on a collar formed on the ring. During assembly of the knob, the ring is stripped of the stator by exerting a pressure on the latter. The intermeshing means are therefore used temporarily and should not hinder the normal operation of the turning knob. Other means for fastening the sensitivity ring to the stator may be envisaged.<br>
According to a variant embodiment of the knob, the cup defined above is able to receive a torsion spring loading the barrel during its rotation. In this case one is dealing with a so-called restoring turning knob that can take two positions one of which is fleeting. Such a knob does not comprise any sensitivity ring and uses a stator exhibiting two diametrically opposite lateral openings so as to permit only a single key withdrawal.<br><br>

A and B-B defined in Figure 12 of the knob with lock<br>
illustrated in Figure 11.<br>
The turning knob wi th lock i1lus trated in the figures is a knob 1, 1' operated with the aid of a key 2 turning in a barrel 11. This knob 1, 1' comprises a body 10 having the form of a tubular component axisymmetric about an X axis, It is intended to be fixed in an opening made in a panel or a wall for example by means of a customary fixing base (see patent application EP 889 564) . Below the base is mounted at least one breaker electrical block, the assembling of each electrical block to the base being performed by attachment means such as those described in patent WO 97/28552. The barrel 11 is mounted rotatably with<br><br>
respect to the body 10 and can take at least two functional positions, held or fleeting.<br>
Subsequently in the description, the use of the terms "axial", "axially", "coaxial" or "transverse" are defined with respect to the aforesaid X axis.<br>
Likewise the terms "top", "bottom", "upper", "lower", "above", "below" or terms with equivalent senses should be understood with respect to the aforesaid X axis when the latter is vertical.<br>
Figures 1 to 9F represent a turning knob 1 with lock that can take at least two held positions.<br>
The body 10 of this knob 1 exhibits a flared top part 10a and a narrower bottom control part 10b.<br>
The bottom part 10b of the body 10 comprises runner shapes 100 (Figure 7 A) for guiding sliders 12 which, during the rotation of the key 2 and therefore of the barrel 11, move in translation along the X axis under the action of a control component 13.<br>
The flared top part 10a is furnished with a cylindrical external top collar 101, and with an internal collar concentric with the external collar, having the shape of a sleeve 102 defining an axial central opening 103 (Figure 9A) . The external collar 101 and the sleeve 102 define between them a cup 104. The upper flange of the internal sleeve 102 exhibits a plurality of identical notches 105 (Figure 7A) standing parallel to the X axis. These notches 105 are intended to position a stator 14a, 14b furnished with complementary identical flutes 140. The notches 105 slot into the troughs formed by the flutes 140 of the stator.<br>
According to a first variant embodiment represented in Figure 5A, the stator 14a has the shape<br><br>
of an axisyminetric component mounted in a coaxial manner in the knob 1. The stator 14a comprises a substantially cylindrical top part and a likewise cylindrical bottom part but of smaller diameter, defining between them a transverse annular shoulder 141 (Figure 8A) . Two diametrically opposite flats 142 are formed on the external surface of the top part of the stator 14a, Between these two flats 142, the lateral surface of the top part of the stator 14a comprises six identical diametrically opposite openings 143a. At its bottom part, the stator 14a exhibits a fluted crown, whose flutes 140 are oriented longitudinally along the X axis. These flutes 140 are complementary to the notches 105 formed on the upper flange of the internal sleeve 102 of the body 10 and are intended to cooperate with them. The notches.105 and the corresponding flutes 140 form members for positioning the stator 14a on the body 10,<br>
The stator 14b according to the second variant embodiment and represented in Figure 5B, differs from that described above by the fact that: <br>
-	It simply comprises two diametrically opposite lateral openings 143b,<br>
-	It does not comprise any flats on the lateral surface of its top part.<br>
Subsequently in the description, we will use the reference "14" to refer to the two stator variants, It will be necessary to understand this description as well as corresponding Figures 1 to 9F as being applicable to both variant embodiments of the stator.<br>
The cup 104 defined between the collar 101 and the internal sleeve 102 of the body 10 houses a helical compression spring 15 applied on the one hand to the bottom of the cup 104 and on the other hand against a<br><br>
sensitivity ring 16 (Figures 2 and 7B) so as to load the latter along the X axis. The body 10 exhibits on the internal surface of its top part 10a two diametrically opposite runners 106 (Figures 4B and 7A) in which the sensitivity ring 16 is able to slide along the X axis when it is loaded. To slide axially against the runners of the body, the sensitivity ring 16 comprises nooks 160 or other analogous trough-like or relief-like shapes (Figure 7B). The sensitivity ring 16 also comprises actuation cam shapes 161 consisting of slopes and notches corresponding to the desired functional positions of the knob 1.<br>
The sensitivity ring 16 is loaded in translation by a lock-cover 17 (Figure 7D) having the form of an axisymmetric component inserted axially between the stator 14 and the top part 10a of the body 10. The lock-cover 17 exhibits an upper collar defining a transverse annular shoulder 170 by which it rests on the upper flange of the body 10 of the knob 1 (Figures 4A to 4C) . This lock-cover 17 follows the cam shapes 161 provided on the sensitivity ring 16 with the aid of two diametrically opposite teeth 171 with beveled end, extending downwards, along the X axis (Figure 4A and 7D) . In proximity to its upper end, on its internal surface the lock-cover 17 exhibits projections 172 forming transverse surfaces intended to constitute bearings for a head 11a of the barrel 11. The two flats 142 made on the exterior surface of the stator 14 make it possible to prevent the burr of the join plane that arises from the manufacture of the stator from hindering the rotation of the lock-cover 17 in the body 10 of the knob.<br>
The head 11a of the barrel 11 bears against the projections 172 of the lock-cover 17 and is gripped by the latter so as to rotationally fasten the barrel 11 and the lock-cover 17. The head 11a of the barrel is lengthened along the X axis by an intermediate part lib<br><br>
comprising tabs 110 (Figure 6) forming the lock mechanism. When these tabs 110 are situated opposite a lateral opening 143a, 143b of the stator 14, withdrawal of the key 2 from the barrel 11 is possible. During this key withdrawal 2, the tabs 110 exit the barrel and project into the opening of the stator 14 facing them. The barrel 11 can therefore no longer rotate in the stator 14, The tabs 110 are each associated with a spring (not represented) which, during the withdrawal of the key 2, brings them back outwards, During the insertion of the key 2, the notches present on the key pull the tabs 110 inwards into the stator 14. Once the key 2 has been pushed fully into the barrel 11, the tabs 110 no longer project through the opening of the stator, thus permitting the barrel 11 to rotate in the stator 14, The lock-cover 17 comprises a cleft 174 intended to receive an index 19 (Figure 2) allowing a user to tag the position of the knob 1, The tabs 110 project from the barrel 11 for example away from this index 19 (Figure 6) ,<br>
The intermediate part l1b of the barrel 11 is lengthened by a span 11c for centering in the central opening 103 formed by the sleeve 102, which is applied against the internal face of the sleeve 102 of the body 10 and which offers an annular shoulder or a furrow for receiving a lip seal 18 ensuring good leaktightness with the internal face of the sleeve 102. The barrel 11 terminates with a shank l1d intended to intermesh with the control component 13 with the aid of intermeshing shapes 111 (Figure 6) interlocking with respective shapes of the control component 13 (Figures 4A and 4B), The shank l1d of the barrel also exhibits indexation shapes, for example squares, for rotationally engaging the control component 13.<br>
To limit the rotation of the barrel 11, the lock-cover 17 secured to the barrel 11 comprises two axial and diametrically opposite lateral lugs 173 (Figures 4C and 7D) , in relief on its external surface, turning in<br><br>
relation to the internal surface of the collar 101 of the body 10, between two abutments formed on this internal surface. The rotational sweep of the barrel 11 is for example a quarter turn. The barrel 11 is engaged in the lock-cover 17 so that the tabs 110 of the lock-cover are opposite one of the lateral lugs 173 of the lock-cover 17.<br>
The control component 13 (Figure 7C) has the form of a tubular component exhibiting, at its top part, a span for centering 13 0 in the opening 103 defined by the internal sleeve 102 of the body 10 and, at its bottom part, cam shapes 131 for actuating the sliders 12. It also exhibits an internal sleeve 132 of square and constant transverse section into which is inserted the shank l1d of the barrel 11 (Figures 4A to 4C) . Intermeshing shapes 133 are provided on the internal surface of this sleeve for cooperating with the corresponding intermeshing shapes 111 of the shank lid of the barrel 11. The control component 13 furthermore comprises a coaxial external cylindrical skirt 135 exhibiting a lower flange whose contour defines the cam shapes 131. The skirt 135 forms with the centering span 13 0 an annular shoulder 134 defining a transverse surface opposite the lower flange of the internal sleeve 102 of the body 10.<br>
According to the invention, between its top part and its bottom part the stator 14 also exhibits means for intermeshing the sensitivity ring 16 (Figures 5A to 5C) . During assembly of the knob 1, the sensitivity ring 16 is axially intermeshed with the stator 14. These intermeshing means comprise at least two diametrically opposite studs 144 (Figure 5C) formed on the lateral wall of the stator 14, above the flutes 140, The sensitivity ring 16 comprises an internal collar 162 defining a lower transverse annular surface against which the studs 144 bear and is gripped between said studs 144 and the annular shoulder 141 defined<br><br>
between the top part and the bottom part of the stator<br>
14.<br>
With reference to Figures 9A to 9F, assembly of the knob 1 occurs in the following manner:<br>
In the body of the knob 1 is placed firstly the helical spring 15 in the cup 104 defined between the internal sleeve 102 and the external collar 101 (Figure 9A) . Thereafter, as explained above, the sensitivity ring 16 is temporarily intermeshed with the stator 14 (Figures 9B and 9C) , The lock-cover 17 is thereafter placed around the stator 14 so that its teeth 171 cooperate with the cam shapes 161 provided on the sensitivity ring 16 (Figure 9D) . The lock-cover/stator/sensitivity ring subassembly is thereafter inserted along the X axis into the body 10 of the knob 1 so that the flutes 140 of the stator 14 cooperate with the corresponding notches 105 formed- on the upper flange of the internal sleeve 102 of the body 10 of the knob 1 (Figure 9E). Thereafter, the sensitivity ring 16 is stripped by pressing the lock-cover 17 towards the interior of the body 10 of the knob 1 (Figure 9F). The sensitivity ring 16 unfastened from the stator 14 thus compresses the spring 15. The upper end of the spring 15 thus bears against the annular surface defined by the internal collar 162 of the sensitivity ring 16. The barrel 11 as well as the other components, such as the control component 13, can thereafter be inserted to finalize the assembly of the product. The barrel 11 is mounted such that it grips the lock-cover 17 so as to engage the latter during the rotation of the key 2. The barrel 11 is positioned so that its tabs 110 are opposite one of the lateral lugs 173 of the lock-cover 17.<br>
Figures 8A to 8G represent according to a transverse section, a turning knob with lock with one or the other of the stators 14a, 14b taking various<br><br>
positions so as to offer various combinations of key withdrawals. The transverse section is a cut through the knob level with the top part of the stator.<br>
With reference to Figures 8A to 8G, depending on the position of the stator 14 and the number of lateral openings 143a, 143b thereof, it is possible to obtain various combinations of key withdrawals. The position of the stator 14 with respect to the tabs 110 of the barrel 11 and therefore of the lock-cover 17 determines the position of the key withdrawals and, if the stator exhibits several lateral openings the possible momber of key withdrawals.<br>
In Figures 8A to 8D, a stator 14a according to the first variant embodiment is used, furnished with six lateral openings 143a. The barrel 11 has a rotational sweep of a quarter turn symbolized by the arrow in Figure 8A. In Figure 8A, it is noted that over the rotational travel of the barrel 11, the tabs can position themselves opposite three lateral openings 143a. Withdrawal of the key 2 is therefore possible in the center (C) , on the left (G) and on the right (D) , In Figure 8B, it is noted on the other hand that over the rotational travel of the barrel 11, the tabs 110 can only position themselves opposite two lateral openings. Withdrawal of the key 2 is therefore possible in the center (C) and on the right (D) . In Figure 8C, the withdrawal of the key 2 is possible in the center<br>
(C)	and on the left (G) and in Figure 8D, withdrawal of<br>
the key 2 is possible on the left (G) and on the right<br>
(D)	.<br>
When a stator 14b similar to that of the second variant embodiment described above is used, a single key withdrawal 2 is permitted (Figures 8E to 8G) . Depending on the position of this stator 14b, the withdrawal of the key 2 can be permitted in the center<br><br>
(C, Figure 8E) , on the left (G, Figure 8F) or on the right (D, Figure 8G).<br>
Figures 10 to 12B, illustrate a so-called restoring turning knob 1' with lock, that is to say one that can take two positions one of these positions being fleeting. In this type of knob 1' , a torsion spring 15' rather than a helical spring is therefore used. This torsion spring 15' is secured to the body 10 of the knob and the lock-cover 17' , itself secured to the barrel 11. This spring 15' therefore loads the barrel 11 during the rotation of the latter. This so-called restoring type of knob, does not comprise any sensitivity ring 16 and therefore uses a different lock cover 17' from that used in a knob of the positions type. The end of the teeth 171' of this lock-cover 17' is not beveled and these teeth 171', during rotation, are disposed between the internal surface of the body 10 and the runners 106 formed thereon (Figure 12B). The external surface of this lock-cover 17' is therefore situated opposite the internal surface of the body 10. The stator 14b used in this knob 1' simply exhibits two diametrically opposite lateral openings 143b and therefore permits only a single key withdrawal 2. The other parts of a restoring knob, in particular the positioning members used to position the stator in the body, are similar to those described above for a knob of the positions type.<br>
It is of course understood that it is possible, without departing from the scope of the invention, to contemplate other variants and refinements of detail and likewise envisage the use of equivalent means.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
