				<td>SWITCHED AMPLIFIER DRIVE CIRCUIT FOR LIQUID CRYSTAL DISPLAYS<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to the field of video systems utilizing a liquid crystal<br>
display (LCD) or liquid crystal on silicon (LCOS), and in particular, to a switched<br>
driver circuit for such displays.<br>
Description of Related Art<br>
Liquid crystal on silicon (LCOS) can be thought of as one large liquid<br>
crystal formed on a silicon wafer. The silicon wafer is divided into an<br>
incremental array of tiny plate electrodes. A tiny incremental region of the liquid<br>
crystal is influenced by the electric field generated by each tiny plate and the<br>
common plate. Each such tiny plate and corresponding liquid crystal region are<br>
together referred to as a cell of the imager. Each cell corresponds to an<br>
individually controllable pixel. A common plate electrode is disposed on the<br>
other side of the liquid crystal (LC). The drive voltages are supplied to plate<br>
electrodes on each side of the LCOS array. Each cell, or pixel, remains lighted<br>
with the same intensity until the input signal is changed, thus acting as a sample<br>
and hold. Each set of common and variable plate electrodes forms an imager.<br>
One imager is provided for each color, in this case, one imager each for red,<br>
green and blue.<br>
It is typical to drive the imager of an LCOS display with a frame-doubled<br>
signal to avoid 30 Hz flicker, by sending first a normal frame in which the<br>
voltage at the electrodes associated with each cell is positive with respect to the<br>
voltage at the common electrode (positive picture) and then an inverted frame in<br>
which the voltage at the electrodes associated with each cell is negative with<br>
respect the voltage at the common electrode (negative picture) in response to a<br>
given input picture. The generation of positive and negative pictures ensures<br>
that each pixel will be written with a positive electric field followed by a negative<br>
electric field. The resulting drive field has a zero DC component, which is<br>
necessary to avoid the image sticking, and ultimately, permanent degradation of<br>
the imager. It has been determined that the human eye responds to the average<br>
value of the brightness of the pixels produced by these positive and negative<br>
pictures.<br>
The present state of the art in LCOS requires the adjustment of the common-<br>
mode electrode voltage, denoted VITO, to be precisely between the positive and<br>
negative field drive for the LCOS. The subscript ITO refers to the material indium<br>
tin oxide. The average balance is necessary in order to minimize flicker, as well<br>
as to prevent a phenomenon known as image sticking.<br>
In the current art, the LCOS drive cell looks much like a conventional Active<br>
Matrix LCD driver. This does not work well, due to the various artifacts discussed<br>
in the literature. The main causes are parasitic capacitance cross-talk, residual<br>
voltage in the LC cell, and voltage droop of the LC, due to ionic leakage and bulk<br>
resistivity of the LC material. Mainly this has been solved by: 1. Increasing the<br>
cell capacitance (limited by physical area), 2. Changing to higher resistivity LC<br>
materials (limits flexibility and response time), 3. Increasing the frame scan rate<br>
to more than 60Hz (expensive, and costs more bandwidth). 4. Strongly<br>
controlling the temperature of the device, to maintain high voltage holding ratio<br>
(VHR).<br>
US patent no. 5627557 discloses a display apparatus according to this invention<br>
includes a plurality of pixels, each of which is supplied with a pixel data; a pixel<br>
capacitance for accumulating an electric charge in accordance with the pixel<br>
data; a holding capacitance provided to each of the pixels to hold the pixel data;<br>
and a buffer amplifier for supplying the electric charge to the pixel capacitance in<br>
accordance with the voltage of the holding capacitance. Another display<br>
apparatus of this invention includes a plurality of pixels, each of which is supplied<br>
with a pixel data; a pixel capacitance for accumulating an electric charge in<br>
accordance with the pixel data; a first holding capacitance provided to each of<br>
the pixels in order to hold the pixel data; a display changing circuit which is<br>
controlled to be turned on/off by a display changing signal; a second holding<br>
capacitance which is supplied with the electric charge by the first holding<br>
capacitance via the display changing circuit; and a buffer amplifier for supplying<br>
the electric charge to the pixel capacitance in accordance with the voltage of the<br>
second holding capacitance.<br>
US patent no. 5680149 discloses in a driving circuit for driving an active matrix<br>
type liquid crystal display device, the analog buffer includes a differential circuit<br>
constructed by P-channel thin film transistors (TFTs) and a current mirror circuit<br>
constructed by N-channel TFTs. When a voltage on a first input terminal of the<br>
differential circuit which is connected with a storage capacitor increases, an input<br>
current in the current mirror circuit connected with a reverse phase output<br>
terminal to the first input terminal decreases and an output current of the<br>
current mirror circuit decreases in response to decrease of the input current of<br>
the current mirror circuit. On the other hand, since a current through a common<br>
phase output terminal to the first input terminal increases, a voltage on the<br>
signal line increases and reaches a voltage on the first input terminal of the<br>
differential circuit.<br>
US patent no. 5945972 discloses a display device includes a substrate, a plurality<br>
of pixels arranged in rows and columns on the substrate, and a plurality of signal<br>
lines for providing an image signal to the pixels on a column-by-column basis.<br>
Each of the pixels comprises a plurality of memory elements for storing image<br>
signals sent over a corresponding one of the signal lines, a selector for selecting<br>
one of the memory elements, and a display element for displaying a dot at a<br>
brightness corresponding to an image signal stored in the selected memory<br>
elements.<br>
The main cause for all of the above issues is that the available charge is only<br>
transferred to the LC cell once per frame. In a display with a million pixels, this<br>
limits the available power and doesn"t allow for any closed-loop check that the<br>
desired voltage has actually been achieved on the pixel electrode. Additionally,<br>
the issues of flicker, drive voltage, and image retention have been addressed in<br>
various ways for digital drive LCOS displays, but such methods fail to provide a<br>
solution to the problem in analog systems due to the need for continuous<br>
updating. Thus, a need exists for a display driver that provides adequate<br>
isolation between a storage capacitor and a liquid crystal cell and further<br>
eliminates flicker without the need for frame doubling.<br>
Brief Summary of the Invention<br>
In a first aspect of the present invention, a display driver for a display unit<br>

the liquid crystal cell, and a switching arrangement for switching the liquid<br>

Detailed description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
In order to overcome the problems described above, it is proposed to add<br>
an amplifier such as a differential amplifier 16 between the internal storage<br>
capacitance (14), and the LC cell (20) as shown in FIG. 1. In other words, a<br>
drive amplifier is added to the driving LC cell. This adds isolation between the<br>
storage capacitor and the LC cell. The added current drive capability ensures<br>
that the voltage on the pixel will rapidly become that desired. It also allows for<br>
very low leakage current from the storage capacitor (FET has very high input<br>
impedance), and allows for a continuous refresh of the voltage on the LC, which<br>
eliminates the "droop" problem, as well as the residual voltaic potential stored in<br>
the cell. This should improve both the flicker issue, as well as the "image<br>
sticking" problem which is associated with the inability to acheve DC balance in<br>
the cell. It should also allow the cell to work well even at somewhat elevated<br>
temperatures.<br>
The disadvantage of this technique is that it increases the DC current<br>
through the liquid crystal cell. This disadvantage can be overcome in part by<br>
gating the current source in the bottom of the differential amplifier. This can use<br>
the "pixel select" or "row select" bit in the device (see FIG.1). In this way, a<br>
periodic refresh of the voltage can be achieved, while reducing the power<br>
consumption by 1/nrow, where nrow is the number of rows in the device. Since<br>
heating is uniform, this gating in some situations may not be needed.<br>
A typical implementation in CMOS is shown in FIG 1. The components<br>
are schematic representations, and alternate configurations can be used without<br>
loss of generality. The key points are the amplifier 16, which applies a closed<br>
loop correction voltage to the LC cell, and the gated current source which allows<br>
reduction of power consumption.<br>
Typically this circuit could be implemented with 3 transistors, which can<br>
be placed under the liquid crystal cell in an LCOS display device. In the<br>
arrangement of FIG. 1, the amplifier 16 decouples the LC cell from the memory<br>
element. FIG. 1 illustrates a liquid crystal cell driver 10 for a liquid crystal<br>
display. The liquid crystal cell driver preferably comprises a plurality of<br>
transistors (12, 15, 17, and 18) coupled to each other as shown in FIG. 1, a<br>
storage capacitance such as a storage capacitor 14, and a plurality of resistors<br>
19 and 21. Preferably, three (3)transistors, such as transistors 15, 17 and 18<br>
form the amplifier 1 6, preferably in the form of a differential amplifier which<br>
serves as the buffer or isolation amplifier. The differential amplifier 16 is<br>
preferably comprised of N-Channel transistors serving as an output to the liquid<br>
crystal cell. Additionally, the respective source electodes of the transistors of<br>
the differential amplifier are driven by a current source such as an N-Channel<br>
transistor such as transistor 18 that may be gated. This current mirror<br>
arrangement ensures a predetermined voltage on a given pixel. The differential<br>
amplifier 16 is coupled between the storage capacitor 14 and provides isolation<br>
between the storage capacitor 14 and a liquid crystal cell or pixel.<br>
The arrangement of FIG. 2 adds a global switch element (32) to transfer<br>
data from the storage element to the driver. This allows for increased pixel drive<br>
for the same circuit operating voltages, and reduces image retention and flicker<br>
by allowing for inversion of the pixel drive voltage and the ITO transparent<br>
conductive electrode from frame to frame. Referring to FIG. 2, another liquid<br>
crystal cell driver 30 is shown similar to the liquid crystal cell driver 10 of FIG. 1.<br>
In addition to the elements previously recited with respect to cell driver 10, cell<br>
driver 30 further comprises a global switch element 32 in the form of a transistor<br>
coupled between the storage capacitor 14 and the differential amplifier 16. The<br>
global switch element transfers data from the memory cell to a driver capacitor<br>
36 of the display driver.<br>
The problem of flicker has been addressed by many mechanisms in the<br>
past. The issue of drive voltage and image retention has been addressed in<br>
digital drive LCOS displays. For analog systems, drive voltage and image<br>
retention issues can be addressed similarly, due to the need for continuous<br>
updating.<br>
The main benefit of the technique disclosed herein is to separate the driver<br>
capacitor 36 from the storage capacitor 14. This separation as shown in FIG. 2<br>
allows for updating all the cells of entire LC array at one time if desired. The<br>
benefit of this is two-fold. First, this separation (with further pre-processing to<br>
determine which LC cells have changed from frame to frame) also allows for<br>
updating of only the cells in the LC array that have changed from a prior frame.<br>
In other words, the contents of the storage capacitor 14 can be changed without<br>
instantaneously changing the display content on the LC cells. This greatly<br>
reduces the data rate needed for static pictures. It also allows for the possibility<br>
of driving the display in an interlaced mode without displaying interline scanning<br>
artifacts. In a system which is interlaced, normally odd lines are written on a<br>
first scan, and even lines are written on a second scan. This scanning scheme<br>
produces the artifact known as "interline flicker". This even happens for data<br>
which is not intrinsically interlaced, such as film. The reason for "interline flicker"<br>
is that the even lines from one frame are displayed at the same time that the odd<br>
lines from the previous frame are displayed. Any portion of the frame which<br>
changed will show an interline flicker. With the present invention, a display<br>
having an array of storage capacitors (14) corresponding to an array of LC cells<br>
would be updated just as normal (even lines followed by odd lines), except that<br>
the entire LC array would then be updated once the storage array has been filled.<br>
Thus, lines from different fames are never displayed simultaneously. The second<br>
benefit of this technique is that it allows the common electrode voltage to be<br>
modulated from frame to frame. This modulation increases the effective electric<br>
field which can be applied to the LC cell for a given operating voltage of the<br>
driver circuit. This is a significant advantage, as finer process geometry will<br>
reduce the maximum allowed driving voltage. The benefits described above only<br>
occur when the pixels are all updated at once. The simultaneous updating of the<br>
pixels can only be done if the storage array (array of storage capacitors (14)) is<br>
separated from the driver array (array of driver capacitors (36)).<br>
The technique can most simply be implemented with the circuit described<br>
in FIG. 1, with a modification as shown in FIG. 2. The voltage Vnn of FIG. 2 is a<br>
static voltage which controls the current source for the transistors 15 and 17.<br>
The Row and Column address are normal addressing for an active matrix display.<br>
The control signals (Transfer and Discharge) are separate globally controlled<br>
signals which transfer the charge on the storage capacitor 14 to the drive<br>
capacitor 36, which drives the LC cell. The additional transistors 32 and 34 and<br>
capacitor 36 on the device are added to implement the new circuit and<br>
operationally allows for the adequate discharge of current from the storage<br>
capacitor 14 after each transfer. The additional components should not be<br>
significant as process fabrication technology moves forward towards 0.1<br>
microns and below.<br>
In the arrangement of FIG. 1, an isolation amplifier was added to decouple<br>
the LC cell from the memory element, as explained before. The additional<br>
embodiment of the invention of FIG. 3, adds a second cell driver portion having a<br>
second storage cell (preferably storage capacitor 14") and amplifier (preferably<br>
differential amplifier 16" including transistors 15" and 17" and 18") and a pair of<br>
transistors (72 and 74) to switch between the two drive cells at a high rate of<br>
speed. The second drive cell also preferably comprises transistors 12" and 18"<br>
and resistors 19" and 24" arranged similarly to the embodiment of FIG. 1.) This<br>
eliminates flicker without the need for frame doubling. It can also be used to<br>
increase the drive voltage available on the cell.<br>
The basic advantage of the embodiment of FIG. 3 for driving LCOS is that<br>
it uses two separate storage elements and drive circuits that are switched to<br>
drive the LC cell. This allows a fast switching frequency, which makes the<br>
flicker rate of the cell much above frequencies detectable by the human eye. It<br>
also allows for the possibility of switching the common electrode voltage (Vito)<br>
to help to increase the possible RMS voltage on the cell for a given operating<br>
voltage of the silicon back plane.<br>
The upper cell (using transistor 72) contains the voltage to drive the LC<br>
during the "positive" frame, the lower cell (using transistor 74) contains the<br>
voltage to drive the LC in the "negative" frame. The voltage during the positive<br>
and negative frames must be balanced with Vito in order to avoid a net DC<br>
voltage on the cell, and resultant imager retention and reliability issues. VDD<br>
and VSS are the upper and lower operating voltages for the CMOS devices.<br>
VNN is set to regulate the current through the transistors of the differential<br>
amplifiers, and controls the power dissipation of the amplifier. V1 and V2 are<br>
global switching voltages which determine which amplifier is driving the Liquid<br>
Crystal cell. A timing diagram for a static Vito is shown in FIG. 6. A timing<br>
diagram for switched Vito is shown in FIG. 7.<br>
Further referring to FIGs. 6 and 7, these timing diagrams reflect the<br>
"positive" picture data (V + ) in the upper storage cell (14) in FIG. 3, and the<br>
"negative" picture data (V-) in the lower storage cell (14"). In the case of FIG. 6,<br>
Vito is not switched. When V1 is switched high (and V2 being low), the<br>
transistor 72 is turned on, and V+ is applied to the LC cell. The effective<br>
voltage on the cell is (V+ - Vito). At the next switching time, V1 is switched<br>
low, and V2 is switched high. The transistor 74 is turned on, and V- is applied<br>
to the LC cell. The effective voltage on the cell is (Vito - V-).<br>
In the case of FIG. 7, Vito is switched. When V1 is switched high (and V2<br>
being low), the transistor 72 is turned on, and V+ is applied to the LC cell.<br>
Simultaneously, Vito is switched to low (Vito-), as shown in FIG. 7. The<br>
effective voltage across the LC cell is then (V+ - Vito-). At the next switching<br>
time, V1 is set to low to turn off transistor 72, and switch V2 high to turn on<br>
transistor 74. This applies V- to the cell. Simultaneously, Vito is switched to<br>
high (Vito + ), as shown in FIG. 7. The effective voltage across the LC cell is<br>
then (Vito+ - V-).<br>
If the maximum value of V+ and V- is fixed by the maximum voltage of<br>
the backplane process, then a fixed value of Vito as in FIG. 6 must be (V+ + V-<br>
)/2. If Vito can be switched, as in FIG. 7, Vito- can be V-, and Vito + can be<br>
V + . Thus, the maximum effective voltage on the LC cell is (V+ - V-)/2 for FIG.<br>
6, but V+ - V- for FIG. 7. The timing of FIG. 7 can ONLY be achieved on an<br>
analog system if all of the cells are updated simultaneously by the global<br>
switches V1 and V2.<br>
Typically the time between V1 and V2 switching should be 1 or 2 msec.<br>
This will need to be determined for a given set of LC materials and the<br>
characteristics of the back plane, and response time of the devices.<br>
The obvious detriment of this scheme is that it requires a large number of<br>
transistors to implement (perhaps as many as 12). This should be easily possible<br>
with a 20 micron pixel and a .35 micron process. Similar scaling on smaller<br>
pixels is possible with finer process geometry.<br>
Now referring to FIG. 4, a display unit 50 is shown that can utilize the<br>
display drivers 20 or 30 or 70 as previously described above. The display unit<br>
50 preferably includes a plurality of display elements arranged in a matrix of<br>
rows and columns and a memory element and a liquid crystal cell. The driver<br>
preferably switchably outputs one of a plurality of voltages to the display<br>
elements on at least one of the matrix of rows and columns, the display unit<br>
including a conventional decoder 51 and the driver controlled by the conventional<br>
decoder 51. The driver can include a storage capacitor and a differential amplifier<br>
coupled between the storage capacitor and the liquid crystal cell, whereby the<br>
differential amplifier provides isolation between the storage capacitor and the<br>
liquid crystal cell. The driver can include a decoder and a plurality of<br>
semiconductor switched controlled to be opened or closed by an output signal of<br>
the decoder 51. As shown in FIG. 4, the display unit 50 can include a row drive<br>
circuit having a plurality of row (scanning) address lines 56 and a column drive<br>
circuit 62 having a plurality of column (data) address lines 58.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5, a flow chart is shown illustrating a method 200 of<br>
driving a display in accordance with the present invention. The method 200<br>
preferably comprises the step 202 of providing isolation between memory<br>
elements (such as a storage capacitor) and a liquid crystal cell using a differential<br>
amplifier in each drive cell among a plurality of drive cells. Preferably, the<br>
isolation is provided between a first storage capacitor and the liquid crystal cell<br>
using a first differential amplifier in a first cell and between a second storage<br>
capacitor and the liquid crystal cell using a second differential amplifier in a<br>
second cell. The method 200 also preferably comprises the step 204 of<br>
switching among the plurality of drive cells to drive the liquid crystal cell, where<br>
preferably a pair of transistors performs the function of switching between the<br>
first and second drive cells. Step 208 can further provide the step of eliminating<br>
flicker without frame doubling. The method 200 may further comprise the step<br>
216 of updating an entire array of liquid crystal elements simultaneously and/or<br>
the step 218 of updating only a memory cell that has changed from a previous<br>
frame. Additional benefits of the method 200 may include the step 220 of<br>
driving a memory array in an interlaced mode without displaying interline<br>
