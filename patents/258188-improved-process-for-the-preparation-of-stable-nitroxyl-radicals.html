IMPROVED PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF STABLE NITROXYL RADICALS<br>
The present invention relates to a improved process for the preparation of stable nitroxyl radicals having gen¬eral formula (I):<br><br>
wherein Ri, R2, Rj and R4, the same or different, represent alkyl or isoalkyl groups containing from 1 to 8 carbon at¬oms.<br>
These stable nitroxyl radicals are used as intermedi¬ates in the synthesis of more complex molecules or as addi¬tives (polymerization inhibitors) or as radical reaction control agents and, in particular, polymerization reac¬tions. For these purposes, they are prepared by oxidation with hydrogen peroxide   of the corresponding secondary<br><br>
amines,  1,1,3,3-tetra-alkylisoindolines  having  formula (II) :<br><br>
in the presence of catalysts based on tungstates, as de¬scribed, for example, in P.G. Griffiths, G. Moad, E. Riz-zardo, D.H. Solomon, "Australian Journal of Chemistry" 1983, 36, 397.<br>
The 1,1,3,3-tetra-alkylisoindolines having formula (11) can in turn be prepared, for example, by the cyclodi-merization of dipropargylamines and acetylenes in the pres¬ence of catalysts based on nickel (G.P. Chiusoli, L. Pallini, G. Terenght, "Transition Metal Chemistry" 1983, 8, 189) or cobalt (G.P. Chiusoli, L. Pallini, G. Terenghi, "Transition Metal Chemistry" 1984, 9, 360) or by carbonyla-tion, in the presence of catalysts based on palladium, of dipropargylamines (G.P. Chiusoli, M. Costa, S. Reverberi, G. Salerno, M.G. Terenghi, "Gazzetta Chimica Italiana" 1987, 117, 695). These synthetic methods however are jeop¬ardized by the necessity of preparing the 1,6-diacetylenes<br><br>
(dipropargylamines) used as raw material.<br>
The synthesis set up by Rizzardo and coworkers is of the greatest practical interest, and comprises the synthe¬sis of N-benzylpthalimide from benzyl bromide and potassium phthalimide, followed by its alkylation with a Grignard reagent. In the synthesis of 1,1,3,3-tetramethylisoindoline, for example, the Grignard reagent was prepared starting from methyl iodide and magnesium us¬ing, as solvents, ethyl ether and toluene (in succession): after 4 hours at reflux, N-benzyl-1,1,3,3-tetramethylisoindoline is obtained (37% yield), which is then treated with hydrogen (4 atmospheres; room tempera¬ture) in glacial acetic acid and in the presence of palla¬dium-based catalysts (5% on coal) . After 3 hours of reac¬tion, 1,1,3,3-tetramethylisoindoline is obtained (II, R = CH3) with a yield of 96% (P.G.Griffiths, G. Moad, E. Riz¬zardo, D.H. Solomon, ** Australian Journal of Chemistry" 1983, 36, 397) .<br>
More recently, international patent appl;Lcation PCT/EP2004/002071 describes a synthesis method which allows the preparation of tetra-alkylisoindolines:<br>
- avoiding the use, in the Grignard reaction, of ethyl ether (an extremely flammable solvent which easily gives rise to the formation of peroxides which, in turn, carry the risk of explosion) or its mixtures;<br><br>
and<br>
effecting the subsequent hydrogenolysis of the prod¬uct isolated from the previous step at atmospheric pressure, thus avoiding the use of equipment requir¬ing high pressure operation for operating under pres¬sure and simplifying the process.<br>
Also in this case, however, there are a few problems mainly linked to the need of isolating the products after each of the four reaction steps, and in particular purify¬ing the N-benzyl-l,1,3,3-tetra-alkylisoindolines, after the Grignard reaction, by chromatography on a basic alumina column, a procedure which (particularly on an industrial scale) is lengthy and costly, and the use of acetic acid which is corrosive, in the hydrogenolysis reaction (also using an extra chemical product in the general synthesis economy).<br>
The Applicant has now found that it is possible to prepare stable nitrosylic radicals according to a much simpler process than those described so far and which solves the relative problems. In particular, this improved process allows:<br>
- N-benzyl-l,1,3,3-tetra-alkylisoindolines to be ob¬tained with a degree of purity which is sufficient for allowing them to be used in the subsequent pas¬sages without any purification (thus avoiding column<br><br>
chromatography);<br>
the above product to be obtained starting from simple and economical raw materials (an anhydride and an amine) with two successive reaction in a single step without having to isolate the product of the first reaction (N-benzylphthalimide) from the solution, but eliminating the water formed as by-product through an azeotropic distillation process, and using the solu¬tion thus obtained directly for the Grignard synthe¬sis;<br>
-	the oxidation reaction to be effected directly on the alcoholic solution obtained from the hydrogenation, eliminating the need of acetic acid as solvent and an isolation and purification process of the 1,1,3,3-tetra-alkylisoindoline intermediate; and<br>
-	polymeric acids of molybdenum (or tungsten) to be used as catalysts in the oxidation with hydrogen per¬oxide, which as will appear more evident hereunder, are advantageous with respect to tungstates.<br>
More specifically, according to this improved process, described in the enclosed claims, the stable nitroxyl radi¬cals having formula (I) are prepared in two steps instead of four starting from phthalic anhydride and benzylamine. The first step takes place in an aromatic solvent, prefera¬bly toluene, in order to remove the reaction water \&gt;Y  azeo-<br><br>
tropic distillation. The remaining solution of N-benzylphthalimide is directly transformed into N-benzyl-1,1,3,3-tetra-alkylisoindoline by treatment with a Grignard reagent prepared in methyl-tert-butyl ether, a less vola¬tile solvent than ethyl ether (and therefore less subject to ignition) and which does not give rise to the formation of peroxides, starting from magnesium and a C1-C4 alkyl halide.<br>
Either iodides, bromides or chlorides can be used as alkyl halides. They are normally used in an equimolar quan¬tity with the magnesium or in the presence of an excess (generally up to 10%, but also from 3 to 9%) of either the one or the other reagent.<br>
The molar ratio alkyl halide/N-benzylphthalimide can, in turn, range from 4 to 10 and can be optimized each time, depending on the greater or lesser reactivity of the halide selected and/or of the Grignard reagent deriving therefrom. The best results are generally obtained with ratios ranging from 5 to 9.<br>
The selection of the solvent is of particular impor¬tance. It is well known, in fact, that Grignard reagents must be prepared in ethers. If the reaction with N-benzylphthalimide is carried out in the presence of an ether, however, it is not completed but stops at intermedi¬ate products, mostly containing hydroxyl groups.  It is<br><br>
therefore necessary to prepare the Grignard reagent in ether and then use it in another solvent with a higher boiling point (generally an aromatic solvent such as tolu¬ene, already used in the synthesis of N-benzylphthalimide). The ether can then be removed by distillation during the reaction which is thus completed to give the desired prod¬ucts. This need makes most of the ethers normally adopted for preparing Grignard reagents unusable, for example butyl ether ([n-C4H9]20 with a boiling point of 142-143°C) or bu¬tyl diglime ( [n-C4H90CH2CH2] 2O with a boiling point of 256°C). Although tetrahydrofuran, is widely used for the preparation of Grignard reagents, surprisingly it gives low yields in the tetra-alkylation of N-benzylphthalimide. Methyl-tert-butyl ether, on the contrary, is an excellent solvent as, although it is much less volatile than ethyl ether, it has an acceptable boiling point {55-56°C) and does not give rise to the formation of peroxides.<br>
At the end of the reaction, a partial oxidation of the reaction mixture is effected with air. In order to obtain this partial oxidation, at the end of the Grignard reac¬tion, n-hexane is added and the mixture is stirred in air from 3 to 5 hours. During this time, most of the impurities are oxidized giving rise to the formation of insoluble ma¬terials. At the same time, the colour of the suspended sol¬ids becomes dark purple, whereas the organic phase remains<br><br>
a pale-yellow colour. At the end, the raw reaction product is filtered, the filtrate is recovered and the solvents are removed at reduced pressure obtaining N-benzyl-l,l,3,3-tetra-alkylisoindoline having a purity which is such as to allow it to be used in the subsequent passages without fur¬ther purification.<br>
In the second step of the improved process, the N-benzyl-1,1,3,3-tetra-alkylisoindolines are transformed into 1,1, 3, 3-tetra-alkylisoindolines by treatment with hydrogen in alcohol, for example and preferably methanol, and in the presence of palladium-based catalysts at 5% by weight ap¬proximately on coal. It is preferable to operate at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. The solution is fil¬tered to eliminate the catalyst and subjected to oxidation reaction with hydrogen peroxide in the presence of suitable catalysts and polar solvents, for example the same solvent as the second step (methanol) or possibly another solvent easily miscible therewith (water, acetonitrile, etc.) to give the final stable nitroxyl radical. As already men¬tioned, the prior art recommends the use of catalysts con¬sisting of tungstates, but the Applicant has now found that the use of polymeric acids (or their salts) of molybdenum or tungsten provide various significant advantages. The characteristic of molybdenum and tungsten of producing a whole series of polymeric acids (polymolybdic and polytung-<br><br>
Stic) is well known, which can sometimes also incorporate different elements such as phosphorous, silicon, etc. (het-eropolyacids). These acids and their salts of ammonium or alkaline metals are also capable of catalyzing the oxida¬tion of 1,1,3,3-tetra-alkylisoindolines with hydrogen per¬oxide: it is in fact possible to use ammonium heptamolyb-date [ {NH4) 6M07O24.4 H2O] , ammonium paratungstate [ {NH4)ioWi204i] , ammonium metatungstate [ (NH4) 6W12O39 . x H2O] or tetra-alkylammonium peroxide phosphotungstates such as [{n-C8Hi7)NCH3]3PW4024 (C. Venturello, R. D'Aloisio, "Journal of Organic Chemistry" 1988, 53, 1553). The use of polymo-lybdate salts is particular convenient: they are as effi¬cient as tungstates but less costly and, in addition, their solutions in the presence of hydrogen peroxide are a dark orange colour which becomes yellowish when the concentra¬tion of hydrogen peroxide is negligible. This colour varia¬tion allows and easy and effective monitoring of the reac¬tion trend.<br>
According to the process improved by the Applicant, the oxidation of 1,1,3,3-tetra-alkylisoindolines with hy¬drogen peroxide is preferably carried out in polar solvents (for example water, methanol, acetonitrile or mixtures thereof), with temperatures which, in general, can range from 0 to ecc and atmospheric pressure. The duration of the reaction depends on the conditions adopted and, in par-<br><br>
ticular, on the temperature, the nature and concentration of the substrate, the concentration of the hydrogen perox¬ide and the nature and quantity of catalyst.<br>
If catalysts based on tungstates are used, the prior art suggests carrying out the reaction at room temperature for extremely long times, even 32 hours (P.G. Griffiths, G. Moad, E. Rizzardo, D.H. Solomon, "Australian Journal of Chemistry" 1983, 36, 397) or, with particular substrates, even 10 days (E.G. Rozantsev, V.D. Sholle, "Synthesis 1971, 190) . The Applicant however has found that it is much more convenient to operate at moderate temperatures but higher than ambient values, preferably from 4 0 to 50°C. Under these conditions, the reaction is complete in much shorter times, normally ranging from 2 to 5 hours.<br>
The concentration of the hydrogen peroxide used as oxidant is not critical: solutions of hydrogen peroxide (aqueous or in an organic solvent) can be used with concen¬trations ranging from 1 to 90%. The use of commercial aque¬ous solutions at 30% in such quantities that the hydrogen peroxide/substrate molar ratio ranges from 1.5 to 20, is particularly advantageous and safe. As previously speci¬fied, the duration of the reaction also depends on sub¬strate/oxidation catalyst ratio. Expressing this ratio as: (moles of substrate)/(gram-atoms of metal)<br>
convenient durations are obtained with ratios ranging<br><br>
from 10 to 50.<br>
The improved process for the preparation of stable ni-troxyl radicals, object of the present invention, is now further described by means of the following example, pro¬vided for purely illustrative and non-limiting purposes. EXAMPLE (Part A)<br>
Toluene (250 cm^) and phthalic anhydride (11.6 g, 78 mmoles) are charged into a reactor equipped with a Marcus-son apparatus and benzylamine (8.4 g, 78 mmoles) is added dropwise. A gelatinous suspension is obtained and exothermy is observed (max 40*C).<br>
The mixture is heated to the boiling point of toluene, 110«*C and the reaction water is removed by means of azeo-tropic distillation. After 4 hours, the reaction is com¬plete and the N-benzylphthalimide formed is completely in solution.<br>
The solution previously obtained is used as such in the subsequent passage. Magnesium (8.75g, 36.4 mmoles) and 20 cm^ of methyl-tert-butylether are charged in an inert atmosphere. 2 drops of 1,2-dibromoethane are added and ethyl bromide (38.6 g, 356 mmoles) dissolved in methyl-tert-butylether (100 cm') is then added dropwise at such a rate to spontaneously maintain the reflux of the solvent. At the end of the addition, most of the methyl-tert-butylether is evaporated and the toluene solution of N-<br><br>
benzylphthalimide is added dropwise.<br>
The temperature is brought to 110°C. After 4 hours the mixture is cooled to 20°C, hexane is added and the mixture is stirred in air for approximately 3-4 hours. In this way there is the selective precipitation of the impurities, visible as the precipitate becomes a purple colour and the organic phase a yellowish colour (at the end of the reac¬tion it is a reddish-purple colour).<br>
The raw mixture is filtered, the panel is washed with hexane, removing the solvents by distillation at reduce pressure. A product is obtained which is suitable for the subsequent passage which does not require a costly separa¬tion on a basic aluminum column. 9.34 g of 1,1,3,3-tetraethyl-2-benzylisoindoline are obtained (41%). EXAMPLE (Part B)<br>
The reaction is carried out in a glass reactor at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. 5% palladium on char¬coal (1.7 g) is added to the solution of 1,1,3,3-tetraethyl-2-benzylisoindoline (9.34 g, 29.1 mmoles) in methanol (60 cm') . After some vacuum/nitrogen cycles to eliminate the oxygen, hydrogen is charged. After 3 hours the catalyst is filtered on paper and the solution is used as such for the subsequent oxidation (the yield of 1,1,3,3-tetraethyl-isoindoline is 93% by GC).<br>
The following products are charged into a flask in or-<br><br>
der:<br>
6.6	g (28.5 mmoles) of 1,1,3,3-tetraethylisoindoline in 60 ml of methanol;<br>
3.6	ml of acetonitrile;<br>
1.87 g (22 mmoles) of sodium bicarbonate;<br>
180 mg (0.146 mmoles equal to 1 mmole of Mo) of ammonium<br>
heptamolybdate [ (NH4) 6M07O24. 4 H2O] ;<br>
10.5 ml (92.6 mmoles) of hydrogen peroxide 30% w/v;<br>
and the mixture is stirred at 45°C for 2 h.<br>
After adding a saturated aqueous solution of sodium chloride, the product is extracted with ethyl ether, the organic extract is washed with water until it becomes neu¬tral and anhydrified on sodium sulfate. The solvent is re¬moved by distillation at reduced pressure.<br>
The product obtained, having a solid appearance and orange colour, has a purity of at least 90% and is suitable for polymerization. 4.98 g of 1,1,3,3-tetraethylisoindolin-2-yloxyl are obtained (yield 71%).<br><br><br>
