1<br>
reciprocating driving force of the reciprocating motor 20; a compression unit 80 combined with the cylinder 60 and the piston 70, sucking and discharging gas inside the cylinder 60 by a pressure difference generated by the reciprocating motion; and a resonance spring unit 90 for eiastically supporting the linear reciprocating motion of the reciprocating motor 20 and the piston 70.<br>
And, the reciprocating motor 20 includes an outer stator 21 having a cylindrical shape and fixedly combined with the rear frame 30 and the middle frame 40; an inner stator 22 inserted into the outer stator 21 with a certain interval; a wound coil 23 combined with the outer stator 21; and a mover 24 inserted between the outer stator 21 and the inner stator 22 so as to perform the linear reciprocating motion.<br>
And, the mover 24 includes a magnetic holder 25 having a cylindrical shape and plural permanent magnets 26 combined with the magnetic holder 25 at regular intervals, herein, the magnetic holder 25 is connected to the piston 70.<br>
And, the compression unit 80 includes a discharge cover 81 for covering a compression space (P) of the cylinder 60; a discharge valve 82 disposed in the discharge cover 81 and opening/closing the compression space (P) of the cylinder 60; a valve spring 83 for eiastically supporting the discharge valve 82; and a suction valve 84 combined with the end of the piston 70 and opening/closing a suction path (F) formed inside the piston 70.<br>
And, the resonance spring unit 90 includes a spring supporting rod<br>
2<br><br>
91 curved-formed so as to have a certain area and combined with a certain side of the piston 70 or the mover 24 so as to place between the front frame 50 and the middle frame 40; plural front resonance springs 92 placed between the front frame 50 and the spring supporting rod 91; and plural rear resonance springs 93 placed between the spring supporting rod 91 and the middle frame 40.<br>

in drawings, reference numeral SP is a suction pipe, and DP is a<br>
3<br><br>
discharge pipe.<br>
Hereinafter, the operation of the conventional reciprocating compressor will be described.<br>
First, when power is supplied to the reciprocating motor 20 and current flows on the wound coil 23, by mutual operation between a flux formed on the outer stator 21 and the inner stator 22 by the current flowing on the wound coil 23 and the permanent magnets 26, the mover 24 including the permanent magnets 26 performs the linear reciprocating motion.<br>
The linear reciprocating driving force of the mover 24 is transmitted to the piston 70, the piston 70 performs the linear reciprocating motion inside the cylinder compressor space (P) and simultaneously the compression unit 80 is operated, and accordingly gas is sucked into the cylinder compression space (P), is compressed and is discharged repeatedly.<br>
And, the resonance spring unit 90 stores-releases the linear reciprocating driving force of the reciprocating motor 20 as elastic energy and induces the resonance motion.<br>
However, in the conventional reciprocating compressor, because the cylinder 60 is combined with the front frame 50, the combining portion between them has to be precisely processed, it is intricate to fabricate the frame 50 and the cylinder 60 precisely, and accordingly assembly productivity is lowered and relatively lots of construction parts are required.<br>
When assembly of the front frame 50 and the cylinder 60 is not<br>
4<br><br>
precise, due to the assembly error between the piston 70 and the cylinder 60, compression gas may leak or abrasion may occur on the contact portion between the cylinder 60 and the piston 70, interference or contact may occur among the outer stator 21, the inner stator 22 and the mover 24 of the reciprocating motor inserted therebetween, and accordingly parts may be damaged.<br>
In addition, in the conventional reciprocating compressor, by the elastic force owing to the compression coil spring shape, the front resonance springs 92 and the rear resonance springs 93 tend to rotate while repeating compression/relaxation. In that process, because the spring mounting grooves 91a, 92a and the spring fixation protrusions 92 contacted to the resonance springs 92, 93 may be continually worn away, the front and rear resonance springs 92, 93 may deviate from the fixation positions, at the worst the resonance springs 92, 93 may break away, and accordingly reliability of the compressor is lowered.<br>

In drawings, SP is a suction pipe, and DP is a discharge pipe.<br>
11<br><br>
Hereinafter, the operation of the gas compression structure of the reciprocating compressor in accordance with the present invention will be described.<br>
First, when power is supplied to the reciprocating motor 20 and current flows on the wound coil 23, by mutual operation between a flux formed on the outer stator 21 and the inner stator 22 by the current flowing on the wound coil 23 and the permanent magnets 26, the mover 24 including the permanent magnets 26 performs the linear reciprocating motion.<br>
And, the linear reciprocating driving force of the mover 24 is transmitted to the piston 70, the piston 70 performs the iinear reciprocating motion in the piston insertion hole 102 of the cylinder built-in type frame 100 and simultaneously the compression unit 80 is operated, and accordingly refrigerant gas is sucked into the compression space (P) of the cylinder built-in type frame 100, is compressed and is discharged repeatedly.<br>
 And, the resonance spring unit 90 stores-releases the linear reciprocating driving force of the reciprocating motor 20 as elastic energy and induces the resonance motion.<br>
Accordingly, in the abrasion preventive structure of the reciprocating compressor in accordance with the present invention, the piston insertion hole 102 for receiving the piston 70 is formed at the cylinder built-in type frame 100, the piston 70 is inserted into the piston insertion hole 102 of the cylinder built-in type frame 100, and accordingly it<br>
12<br><br>
is possible to simplify the construction 'parts. In addition, the surface reinforcing layer 200 is coated onto the inner circumference of the piston insertion hole 102 of the cylinder built-in type frame 100, it is possible to minimize friction and abrasion between the outer circumference of the piston 70 and the inner circumference of the piston insertion hole 102 of the cylinder built-in type frame 100 in the linear reciprocating motion of the piston 70.<br>
In the meantime, the piston insertion hole 102 for receiving the piston 70 is formed at the cylinder built-in type frame 100, the piston 70 is inserted into the piston insertion hole 102 of the cylinder built-in type frame 100, it is possible to simplify the assembly process and facilitate the assembly measure management. In addition, it is possible to facilitate measure management of the mover 24 combined with the piston 70 and arranged between the outer stator 21 and the inner stator 22.<br>
In addition, in the conventional reciprocating compressor, by the elastic force owing to the shape of the compression coil spring, the front resonance springs 92 and the rear resonance springs 93 tend to rotate while repeating compression/relaxation. In that process, because the spring mounting grooves 91a, 92a and the spring fixation protrusions 92 contacted to the resonance springs 92, 93 may be continually worn away, the resonance springs 92, 93 may deviate from the fixation positions, at the worst the resonance springs 92, 93 may break away, and accordingly reliability of the compressor is lowered. However, in the present invention, by forming the surface reinforcing layer made of Ni-P alloy material having<br>
13<br><br>
high hardness at the inner surface of the spring mounting grooves 91a, 92a and the outer surface of the spring fixation protrusions 94, it is possible to prevent abrasion of the mounting grooves 91a, 92a and the spring fixation protrusions 94 from occurring.<br>
As described above, in the operation of the compressor, by preventing friction and abrasion of the cylinder built-in type frame 100 at which the front and rear resonance springs 92, 93 as the compression coil springs are contacted or the middle frame 40 and the spring supporting rod 91, deviation or breakaway of the springs 92, 93 can be prevented, and accordingly reliability of the compressor can be improved.<br>

In addition, in the abrasion preventive structure of the reciprocating<br>
14<br><br>
compressor in accordance with the present invention, it is possible to reduce the number of construction parts for compressing gas and simplify process and assembly of the construction parts.<br><br>

6.	The abrasion preventive structure as claimed in claim 5, wherein the<br>
cylinder built-in type frame is made of aluminium material.<br>
-17-<br>
In an abrasion preventive structure of a reciprocating compressor, by forming a coating layer made of Ni-P alloy material having high hardness onto the surface of a frame at which front (92) and rear (93) resonance springs are contacted or spring mounting grooves (91a, 92a) of a spring supporting rod (91) or spring fixation protrusions or the inner circumference of a cylinder built-in type frame, although each resonance spring (92, 93) is rotated while repeating compression/relaxation, it is possible to prevent abrasion of the spring mounting grooves (91a, 92a) or the spring fixation protrusions, and accordingly reliability of the compressor can be improved.</td>
