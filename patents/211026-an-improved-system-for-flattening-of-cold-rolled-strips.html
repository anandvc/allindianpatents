				<td>The present invention relates to a system for improving the flatness of cold rolled<br>
strips and a process for manufacture of levelled strips using the system of the<br>
invention.<br>
For improvement in flatness of steel it is necessary to stretch the material beyond<br>
its yield point. When strip is bent around a roll, compressive-stresses are<br>
established in layers of the strips surface adjacent to the roll and the tensile<br>
stress on the opposite side. So long as the roll diameter to strip thickness (D/t)<br>
ratio is sufficiently large, these stresses produce only elastic strains which<br>
disappear when the bent portion of the strip is moved past the roll. However, as<br>
the roll diameter to strip thickness ratio is decreased, a point is reached vvhere<br>
the stresses are such that plastic deformation occurs and a coil shape is given to<br>
the strip. For achieving the same strip is passed through a set of rolls and the<br>
strip is imparted a requisite tension.<br>
It is conventionally known to use leveller equipment for improving flatness of coid<br>
rolled strips. The invention is described hereunder in relation to the<br>
accompanying figures wherein<br>
Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 illustrate in detail the thrust bearings provided in the improved<br>
system for the upper an8 lower rollers.<br>
Fig. 2 illustrates the modification in the non-drive side of the upper rollers in the<br>
system of the invention.<br>
Fig. 3 illustrates the modifications in the drive side for the upper rolls in the<br>
system of the invention.<br>
Fig. 4 illustrates in greater detail the modifications at the non-drive end of the<br>
upper rolls in the system of the invention.<br>
Fig. 5 illustrates the modifications in the drive side end of the tower rolls in the<br>
system of the invention.<br>
Fig. 6 shows conventional leveller equipment.<br>
Fig. 7 is a schematic illustration of the improved system for levelling and cold<br>
rolled strips in accordance with the present invention.<br>
Fig. 8 illustrates the modified chassis used in the system of the invention.<br>
Fig. 9 illustrates the modification in the leveller roll end of the system of the<br>
invention.<br>
Figure 10 illustrated the position of the levellers on/off line depending upon the<br>
end use requirement.<br>
The known leveller equipment presently in use as illustrated in accompanying<br>
Fig. 10 is usually mounted online or offline as and when required. Usually two<br>
varieties of such equipments are in use one is for thin gauge (0.3-0.8mm) and the<br>
other is for a thick gauge (0.8-2.5 mm). Depending upon the size of the strip the<br>
equipments are usually selected.<br>
As would be evident from the Fig. 6, such conventional leveller equipments<br>
comprise fixing brackets (1) for fixing with the foundation, chassis (2) to support<br>
different components, pinch rolls (3) in pinch roll housing (4), screw down motors<br>
(5) are provided to drive the screw down mechanism which in turn exerts vertical<br>
force to the strips through rolls (6). Working rolls (6) strengthen and flatten the<br>
strip. The front guard (7) is provided to prevent the shifting of the assembly. The<br>
known leveller usually consist of 17 number of rolls or 21 number of rolls and are<br>
driven by the motor (10) operatively connected to gear box (9) and multi shaft<br>
coupling for driving of the rolls.<br>
It is the basic object of the present invention to provide for an improved system<br>
for use in flattening cold rolled strips without requirement of motor and multi<br>
output gearbox as that conventionally use in known levellers.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide for a system which could<br>
have desired number of working rollers for strengthen and flattening of the strips<br>
depending upon the strip characteristics.<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is to provide for a system for flattening<br>
of cold roll strips which would be simple to obtain, use and at the same time<br>
would be cost effective.<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is to provide for an improved system for<br>
flattening of cold rolled strips which would have a firm foundation and rigidity and<br>
facilitate improved flattening of strips.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide an improved system<br>
wherein the drive is removed as the strip is continuous and tension provided by<br>
the coiler and uncoiler.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide for a process for<br>
flattening of cold rolled strips utilising the system of the invention.<br>
Thus according to one aspect of the present invention there is provided an<br>
improved system for flattening of cold rolled strips comprising :<br>
working rolls comprising upper and lower working rolls adapted to allow<br>
passage of the strip to be flattened therebetween ;<br>
screw down motors operatively connected to screw down mechanism adapted<br>
to exert vertical force to the strip through said working rolls ;<br>
means for guiding of the strip through therebetween said upper and lower<br>
working rolls ;<br>

preventing side thrust.<br>
In accordance with the above improved system for flattening of cold rolled strips<br>
in accordance with the present invention the same achieves the following<br>
distinguishing features in relation to the conventional levellers.<br>
a) The drive system of the conventional levellers have been removed and thrust<br>
bearing have been provided.<br>
b) Wheels have been removed from the leveller equipment and the provision of<br>
fixing of the system to the ground through chassis provide for better stability<br>
and rigidity to the system.<br>
c) Thrust bearings have been provided to prevent side thrust.<br>
d) Modifications in the roll end portions have been effected to facilitate fixing to<br>
the thrust bearings.<br>
