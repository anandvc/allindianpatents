				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of nanocrystalline and mesoporous titanium dioxide (Titania) powder using a new titanium source titanium peroxo carbonate, with a large specific surface area, useful as photo catalyst. The present invention further relates to a method for the preparation of titanium dioxide powder which can be used as a catalyst for the removal of different toxic gases, pollutant organic substances and the like.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Titanium dioxide is used as a photocatalyst. Particularly, titanium dioxide with anatase phase has been known to be highly stable and show excellent photo catalytic activity by absorbing light and reacting with toxic materials. P-25, a brand name of titanium dioxide, manufactured by M/s Degussa Germany, which has been evaluated as being the most active among the presently available photocatalysts, shows insufficient photo activity under a practically employed light intensity of tens of watts, which has limited its practical application. Titania is also an important material used as white pigment, solar-cell device etc. Titanium dioxide powders have been conventionally prepared by a sol-gel method and a chloride process. The sol-gel method is, however, difficult to perform continuously and incurs a high production cost because additional heat treatments must be adopted and alkoxide, the raw material used is moisture sensitive and very expensive. The chloride process, which is at present commonly used, also suffers from disadvantages: it needs a sophisticated experimental setup owing to its high temperature and pressure reaction. This process requires an additional protective facility because of the corrosive gases (Cl2, HC1) produced during the reaction, leading to higher production costs. In addition, special devices are employed for applying electric fields or controlling the reactant mixing ratio to control the shape and size of TiO2 particles. Titanium dioxide P-25, manufactured by Degussa Co., Germany, is well known to be produced using the chloride process and not desirable in terms of production cost and photocatalytic properties.<br>
References may be made to patent 6,517,804, wherein the synthesis of Titania ultrafine powder from pure titanium tetrachloride is reported. The process contains the following steps; addition of ice pieces or icy distilled water to pure titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) to give an aqueous titanylchloride, controlled addition of distilled water to the aqueous titanylchloride solution with heating from controlled hydrolysis is disclosed. Filtering and<br>
washing gave the Titania ultrafine powder. In the above process requires an additional protective facility because of the corrosive gases (Cl2, HC1) produced during the reaction, leading to higher production costs and risky. Again, it demands special care during the dilution and hydrolysis steps, which makes the procedure too complicated. The present process overcomes the above drawbacks.<br>
References may be made to patent application WO2008036176-A1, wherein the synthesis of nanosized Titania using titanium peroxo precursor is disclosed. To titanium compound solution (titanium tetrachloride, titanium oxychloride, titanium trichloride, titanium tetrabromide, hydrated titanium sulfate, or hydrated titanium oxysulfate) excess hydrogen peroxide was added and mixed with an alkali; and/or compound containing sulfate, nitrate, and fluorine ions to accelerate formation of anatase titanium dioxide (TiO2). Then the solution was heated to get the nanosized Titania. Presence of large amount of H2O2 makes the procedure more risky and complicated. Again the used titanium source is moisture sensitive, corrosive and costly. In the present procedure, we are able to avoid the difficulty by using very small amount of H2O2 and the use of bulk TiO2 as titania source avoids other problems.<br>
References may be made to patent applications WO2007085911-A2 and WO2007085911-A3, wherein the synthesis of size homogenous composition of titanium (IV) oxide nanoparticles using alkoxide through a sol-gel process is disclosed. In a detail procedure, a solution of titanium alkoxide precursor was added to an aqueous acidic aqueous solution (below pH 4). The dispersed mixture was constantly stirred for 4 hours, resulting in the formation of a colloidal solution. Only after the solution was refined, a second solution containing the complexing agent was added, and the color of the final solution turned to yellow-orange. Under continuous stirring, to the final sol, an amount of a modifier-stabilizer was added. The preparation of nanostructured titania powders included solvent evaporation followed by thermal treatment of the solid residue at 400-550°C. However, the method is quite complicated and difficult to perform. The used titanium source titanium alkoxide is moisture sensitive and very expensive. Present developed procedure is simple and it is possible to overcome the moisture sensitivity and cost problem by using the titanium peroxo carbonate complex.<br>
References may be made to patent applications CN1398665-A and CN1132679-C for the synthesis of mesoporous TiO2-SiO2. The synthetic procedure contains the following steps: the preparation of an isopropanol titanium-acetone solution; the preparation of a titanium polymerized sol; and the preparation of a titania membrane, soaking the<br>
mesoporous Ti-Si support body in titanium polymerized sol with 1.9-2.5 x 10" Pa.s viscosity for 0.5-2 minutes before taking out and drying naturally for 44-52 hours to form a gel layer, then drying in a vacuum drier, calcining to 630-670°C. The main drawbacks of the procedure are the use of moisture sensitive and costly alkoxide and hazards organic solvent isopropanol. Again the photocatalytic activituy of the synthesized material is not upto the mark. Using the developed procedure it is possible to overcome the above drawbacks.<br>
References may be made to patent JP-A-5-184923, wherein titania catalyst can be obtained by heat-treating amorphous fibers to deposit a crystal of an anatase-form titanium oxide and a vanadium oxide, in which amorphous fibers is produced by the sol-gel method of hydrolyzing a alkoxide in a mixed solution of a titanium alkoxide, a vanadium compound and other alkoxide, successively gelling is disclosed. Used precursor titanium alkoxide is moisture sensitive and costly. Moreover, Titania catalyst described has problems in that the activity is low and the performance of removal of nitrogen oxides is low. The present process overcomes the above drawbacks of moisture sensitive and costly reagent. The synthesized titanium dioxide is catalytically highly active.<br>
References may be made to patent US6444608, wherein the synthesis of mesoporous TiO2 by dissolving a titanium alkoxide in a solvent to give a titanium alkoxide solution; adding a mixed solution containing water and a solvent to the titanium alkoxide solution to perform hydrolysis as well as simultaneous polymerization of titania to give a polymer solution; adding a fatty acid; separating a polymer containing the fatty acid from the polymer solution and calcinations is disclosed. The main drawbacks of the procedure are the use of moisture sensitive, costly alkoxide and hazards organic solvent. It is a complicated procedure. Catalytic activity of the TiO2 towards removal of nitrogen oxides, oxidation of organic substances, decomposition of dioxine compounds, as well as decomposition and removal of organic solvents, agricultural chemical and surfactant is low. Using the developed procedure it is possible to overcome the above drawbacks In all the above stated prior arts, it is evident that selection of titanium source is a crucial step for the synthesis of above mentioned titanium based materials with respect to the moisture sensitivity, risk factor to handle and cost factor. In all the synthetic procedures described above use of titanium epoxide and chloride makes the procedure more complicated costly and risky. Moreover, Titania synthesized by these procedures has problems, in that the catalytic activity is low.<br>
The present invention is directed to a novel approach for the synthesis of nanocrystalline and mesoporous titania using a new titanium source "titanium preoxy-carbonate" which is cost effective, easy to handle to avoid the existing titanium sources which are costly, moisture sensitive and corrosive. The "titanium preoxy-carbonate" is synthesized from bulk titania and the required amount of peroxide is very low which is catalytic amount.<br>
OBJECTIVE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide a process to prepare nanocrystalline and mesoporous titanium dioxide powder from an aqueous titanium peroxy-carbonate solution from bulk titanium dioxide which obviates the drawback as detailed above.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to prepare an aqueous titanium peroxy-carbonate solution from other titanium source viz. titanium alkoxide, titanium tetrachloride and titanium sulphate.<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to provide a method of producing the mesoporous, nanocrystalline titanium dioxide with high specific surface area, narrow pore size distribution and having anatase crystalinity, using the aqueous titanium peroxy-carbonate solution.<br>

Here solid titanium dioxide is initially reacted with ammonium fluoride and hydrofluoric acid to obtain a soluble titanium solution to which ammonia is added to precipitate titanium hydroxide. The latter is reacted with hydrogen peroxide and ammonium carbonate, to obtain a clear solution of titanium peroxo-carbonate solution. The hydrothermal treatment of the titanium peroxo-carbonate solution with / without surfactant gives highly crystalline titanium dioxide with high surface area, porous with narrow pore size / particle size distribution. This titanium<br>
dioxide shows very high photo-catalytic activity. We are reporting for the first time the initial preparation of titanium peroxo-carbonate to obtain highly crystalline and porous titanium dioxide. The prior act neither teaches nor reveals how titanium peroxo-carbonate solution as a source of titanium can be used to prepare crystalline and porous titanium dioxide which exhibits high photo-catalytic activity. The inventive steps adopted in the present invention are (i) it obviates the need of having a starting material which are sensitive to moisture or corrosive, (ii) hydrothermal treatment of titanium peroxo-carbonate in presence of surfactant and peroxide as oxidizing agent decompose carbonate into carbon dioxide and water and thereby facilities formation of porous and material with high crystalline.<br>
