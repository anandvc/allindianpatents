				<td>DISC SHAPE DRIPPER<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to irrigation drippers, and more particularly to drippers fitted integrally in irrigation pipes and to methods for production of such pipes.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
US Patent 6,039,270 describes an irrigation pipe with internally attached emitters. The emitters are placed in the interior of the pipe at its production phase and are sunken almost totally in the wall of the pipe which is swollen at the location of the emitters. The swellings allow to preserve the internal cross-sectional area of the pipe and thus to avoid excessive hydraulic losses and to reduce the required working pressure for irrigation per unit length of the pipe. The emitters disclosed in US 6,039,270 are round in their plan view or are elongated along the pipe axis.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with the present invention, there is provided an integral inline dripper for use bonded to the internal surface of an irrigation pipe. The dripper has an inlet facing the inside of the pipe and an outlet in fluid communication with an exit opening in the pipe wall. The dripper has a flattened shape defined between a first surface with an open meandering channel formed therein, the channel's inlet being in fluid communication with the dripper's inlet, and a second surface opposite the first surface. The topography of the first surface of the dripper is so designed that the dripper can be bonded to the internal surface of the pipe in any orientation about a radius of the pipe passing through<br><br>
the first and the second surface. At that, the topography allows the internal surface of the pipe to be bonded tightly to the first surface of the dripper especially in the areas adjacent the meandering channel so as to form a flow-restriction labyrinth with an outlet constituting or being in fluid communication with the outlet of the dripper.<br>
According to one aspect of the present invention, the dripper has a means for aligning thereof before the bonding so that its first surface faces the internal surface of the pipe. Preferably, the first and the second surface have different shapes, such that the difference may be used as a means for alignment.<br>
In one embodiment of the dripper, the means for alignment is formed as a step, e.g. circular, protruding from the second surface. The circular step may be an annular wall or a cylinder pin, preferably coaxial with an axis of symmetry of the second surface. A cylinder pin protruding from the first surface may be used as well.<br>
In another embodiment, the second surface is more convex than the first surface, e.g. dome-shaped, while the first surface is only slightly convex or substantially flat and this difference is used for alignment.<br>
Preferably, the dripper's inlet is a filtering inlet comprising multiple openings in fluid communication with the inlet of the meandering channel. The openings may be disposed on the second surface or on a peripheral surface connecting the first and second surfaces. For example, the filtering inlet may be formed as multiple radial passages on the first surface, starting with the multiple openings and complemented by the internal surface of the pipe.<br>
The first surface of the dripper may be, for example, flat, dome-shaped, or part of a cylindrical surface. Preferably, the first surface is substantially isometric in plan view, for example it may have a generally circular symmetry, or be just circular in shape. However, the dripper may be also elongated if its size and the topography of the first surface allow bonding in arbitrary orientation about the local pipe's radius.<br><br><br>
In accordance with a second aspect of the present invention, the topography of the second surface is similar to the topography of the first surface, including a second open meandering channel, such that the dripper can be bonded to the pipe with either of the first and second surfaces, in any orientation with respect to a radius of the pipe passing through the first and the second surface.<br>
Preferably, the dripper has a filtering inlet comprising multiple openings as described above, formed as multiple radial passages on both the first and the second surface so as to be complemented by the internal surface of the pipe after bonding.<br>
The dripper may be formed with the second surface as a mirror image of the first surface. Alternatively, the second surface may be identical to the first surface and disposed so that recesses on the second surface are matching protrusions on the first surface and vice-versa.<br>
In accordance with a third aspect of the present invention, there is provided an irrigation pipe with integral in-line drippers of flattened shape bonded to the internal surface of the pipe with a first surface of the drippers. The first surface has an open meandering channel formed therein and closed tightly by the internal surface. The flattened shape is substantially isometric in plan view, or is elongated but at least some of the drippers are bonded with their longer dimension non-parallel to the axis of the pipe.<br>
The drippers of the present invention allow mass production in simple molds or dies. Even more important, as the specially designed form allows bonding in arbitrary orientation, the drippers may be fed to the bonding position with little or no alignment and thus achieve high rate of pipe production.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
With reference to Fig. 1, there is shown an integral in-line dripper 10 according to the invention, bonded during the extrusion process to an extruded irrigation pipe 12, at the internal surface 14 of the pipe.<br><br>
With further reference to Figs. 2A and 2B, the dripper 10 has a top surface 16 designed for bonding to the internal surface 14 of the pipe 12, and a bottom surface 18 facing the inside of the pipe. The top surface 16 and the bottom surface 18 are connected by a peripheral surface 20. It will be appreciated that the terms "top" and "bottom" are purely conventional and pertain only to the orientation shown in Fig. 1.<br>
The dripper 10 further has a meandering channel 22 carved in the top surface 16 of the dripper. The channel 22 has an inlet 24 and an outlet 26. When the dripper is bonded in the pipe, the meandering channel 22 is covered by the internal surface 14 of the pipe to form a labyrinth, and an outlet 27 is formed in the pipe wall, aligned with the outlet 26 of the labyrinth. It will be appreciated that the top surface 16 must allow tight bonding of the pipe wall adjacent the meandering channel 22, so as to ensure that the labyrinth has closed cross-section.<br>
The dripper 10 further has a plurality of openings 28 in the peripheral surface 20, formed as radial passages between ribs 30, in fluid communication with the inlet 24 of the channel 22. When the dripper 10 is bonded to the pipe wall and the passages are covered by the internal surface of the pipe, these openings constitute a distributed filtering inlet.<br>
The dripper 10 has an annular wall (ring) 32 protruding from the bottom surface 18, which is used as a means for alignment. With reference to Fig. 3, the drippers 10 come to a feeder 50 in arbitrary orientation. A rotary ring 52 drags the drippers, by frictional force, along a qualifying ring 54 towards a rejection cam 56. Between the qualifying ring 54 and the rotary ring 52 there is a gap 57 adapted to accommodate the thickness of the dripper but not the ring 32. As a result, drippers oriented with the ring 32 upwards pass under the rejection cam 56 and proceed past a guiding rail 58 towards the extruder. Drippers with different orientation, as denoted by 10', are rejected back into the feeder. Alternatively, in a vibratory bowl system, the vibratory force will move the drippers along the ring<br><br>
52 and against the ring 54 which will be stationary relative to each other. The rejection cam 56 will operate in the same manner as above.<br>
The dripper 10, as well as all other drippers described below have more or less flattened shape such that their smallest dimension "d" is perpendicular to the pipe internal surface when bonded thereto. Their plan form, i.e. the projection along that smallest dimension, or the contour when viewed from the bottom or the top surface, is circular, with diameter not exceeding the diameter of the pipe, assuming a circular pipe cross-section. However, the plan form may be just with approximately equal dimensions in all directions (isometric) or with circular symmetry. Even an elongated plan form may be used, if its longer dimension is about the pipe diameter or less. The dripper plan form and the top surface topography are designed to allow bonding of the dripper to the pipe wall in any orientation about a pipe radius R passing through the center of the top surface.<br>
The dripper 10 and some other drippers described below have a means for alignment of the dripper during pipe manufacture to ensure that its top surface faces the internal surface of the pipe before bonding. If the dripper has an axis of symmetry, the alignment means is preferably coaxial with that axis.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a dripper 35, similar to the dripper 10 except that its alignment means is in the form of cylindrical pin 29 at the top surface 16. The pin is combined with the dripper outlet 26 on the top surface 16.<br>
Figs. 5A and 5B show a dripper 40 where the filtering inlet is disposed on the bottom surface 18. A plurality of openings 42 are formed at crossings of parallel channels 44 made on the bottom surface 18, with an annular channel 46 made on the top surface beside the meandering channel. In this case, a circular step 48 at the bottom surface 18 is used as a means for alignment.<br>
Figs. 6A and 6B show a dripper 60, similar to the dripper 40, with the filtering inlet disposed on the bottom surface 68. Similar elements of the dripper 60 have the same numbers as the elements of the dripper 40. In this case, the bottom surface 68 is dome-shaped, which though having no step can still be used as a means for alignment.<br><br>
The process of alignment of the dripper 60 is shown in Fig. 7. The feeder 50 is essentially the same as that shown in Fig. 3, with a rotary ring 52, a qualifying ring 54, and a rejection cam 56. Between the qualifying ring 54 and the rotary ring 52 there is a gap 57 adapted to accommodate the thin edge of the dripper 60. The drippers oriented with the dome-shaped surface 68 upwards pass under the rejection cam 56, while drippers with opposite orientation, as denoted by 60', are rejected back into the feeder.<br>
It will be appreciated that any difference of shape between the top and the bottom surface of the dripper may be used for selection of properly aligned drippers in the feeder.<br>
Drippers according to the present invention may have no means and no need to be aligned before bonding to ensure that their top surface faces the pipe wall. With reference to Fig. 8, there is shown an integral in-line "double-faced" dripper 70 for irrigation pipe, where each of the top surface 16 and the bottom surface 18 is adapted for bonding to the internal surface of the pipe. The dripper 70 has two meandering channels 22 and 72, at the top and at the bottom surfaces, and two filtering inlets with openings 28 and 78 respectively. Owing to the flattened shape of the dripper, during the pipe manufacturing process, the dripper will always assume a position where one of its top and bottom surfaces faces the pipe wall, without special aligning means. Such dripper can be bonded to the pipe surface with either of the top and the bottom surfaces. In the example shown in Fig. 8, the dripper is made with the bottom surface as mirror image of the top surface.<br>
In Figs. 9A and 9B, there is shown another integral in-line double-faced dripper 80 where both the top surface 16 and the bottom surface 18 are adapted for bonding to the internal surface 14 of the pipe. Here the whole top surface 16 including the meandering channel 22 and the outlet 26 is identical to the bottom surface but is so designed and disposed that recesses on the bottom surface match protrusions on the top surface and vice-versa. In fact, the topography of the bottom surface may be obtained by rotation of the top surface about the axis X.<br><br>
The topography of the top surface (the surface which must be bonded to the pipe) may be flat, convex (dome-shaped), etc. Indeed there is no need that the top surface exactly matches the inner cylindrical surface of an extruded pipe. But the design has to be such that, in the moment of bonding, when the extruded pipe is soft and flexible, it can accommodate the top surface at any orientation thereof.<br>
In all the above embodiments, the plan form of the dripper is circular but it may have any shape with circular symmetry or with approximately equal length and width (isometric). As mentioned above, however, the largest dimension of the plan form is critical, so even an elongated shape may be used if it can be accommodated transversely to the pipe axis. The circular shape has the advantage to roll smoothly in the feeder and to allow faster alignment along the path to the extruder. The topography of the top surface, the plan form of the dripper and the layout of the filtering inlet, the meandering channel and the outlet should allow the dripper to be tightly bonded to the pipe wall in any orientation with respect to the pipe axis.<br>
Though all the explanations have been presented with respect to dippers designed for bonding in an extruded pipe, such drippers may be used with pipes manufactured by any known technology.<br>
With reference to Figs. 10A and 10B, there is shown a flat-welded dripper 90 with a top flat surface 96 designed for welding to the internal surface 14 of the irrigation pipe 12, and a bottom surface 98 facing the inside of the pipe. The top flat surface 96 and the bottom surface 98 are connected by a peripheral surface 92.<br>
The dripper 90 further has a meandering channel 22 carved in the top flat surface 96 of the dripper. The channel 22 has an inlet 24 and an outlet 26. When the dripper is welded in the pipe as shown in Fig. 10B, the meandering channel 22 is covered by the internal surface 14 of the pipe to form a flow-restricting labyrinth, and an outlet is formed in the pipe wall, aligned with the outlet 26 of the labyrinth.<br><br>
The dripper 90 further has a plurality of openings 28 in the peripheral surface 92, formed as passages between ribs 30, in fluid communication with the inlet 24 of the channel 22. When the dripper 90 is welded to the pipe wall and the passages are covered by the internal surface of the pipe, these openings constitute a distributed filtering inlet. Generally, the height of the openings and the total area of the filtering inlet depend on the height AF of the peripheral surface 92.<br>
The dripper 90 has a step 94 in the bottom surface 98, which is used as a means for alignment in a feeder (not shown) supplying the drippers for welding in an extruded pipe. This kind of dripper is welded to the pipe wall with its longer dimension oriented along the pipe axis.<br>
Fig. 11 shows a common dripper 90' with arcuate top surface 96' adjusted to the curvature of the circular section of the irrigation pipe 12, and peripheral surface 92'. It will be appreciated that if the common dripper 90' has the same overall dimensions or the same mass as the novel dripper 90, the former will have smaller height of the peripheral surface AF' than the latter, and thus smaller area of the filtering inlet.<br>
The process of heat welding of the dripper 90 or 90' to the pipe wall is commonly performed together with the extrusion of the pipe 12, as for example explained in the patent US 5,271,786. In the process, the dripper and the pipe wall are pinched together between an internal guide 100 supporting the dripper and an external profiled support, for example a profiled roller 102. At that, the roller profile should be very accurately aligned with the dripper arcuate profile in order to provide uniform pressure on the welded surfaces. Even so, the teeth of the meandering channel 22 are inclined at different angles to the pipe wall 14 from different: sides - if at one side of the channel, teeth come at a sharp angle to the pipe wall, at the other side of the same channel, teeth come at a blunt angle. As the source of heat for welding is the pipe wall coming hot from the extruder, more heat is transferred to the abutting teeth at the side of the sharp angle which causes deformation of the meandering channel cross-section. This is an undesirable defect known as "burning" of the teeth edges.<br><br>
In comparison to the common dripper 90' with arcuate top surface 96' shown in Fig. 11, the flat-top dripper 90 of Figs. 10A and 10B offers the following advantages:<br>
-	Larger peripheral area allowing filtering of the inlet flow at lower flow<br>
velocity;<br>
-	Lower costs of the injection mold for manufacturing the dripper, which<br>
mold has simple flat walls;<br>
-	Lower accuracy needed at the pinching station of the pipe extrusion line<br>
for welding the dripper;<br>
-	Simpler orienting of the drippers in the feeding system of the extrusion<br>
line;<br>
-	Better general quality of the heat-welding under more uniform pressure;<br>
-	Alleviation of the "burning" of the edge problem during welding.<br>
Although a description of specific embodiments has been presented, it is contemplated that various changes could be made without deviating from the scope of the present invention. For example, means for alignment of the dripper before feeding to the extruded pipe may be such difference of shape as different roughness of the top and the bottom surface.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
