I. Isometric view of TWIST CHAIR:<br>
The Invented chair comprises a seat (A), fixed on a seat base (B). The chair provides for two armrests (C) and a Backrest (D) each with spring attached beneath. The extra provisions to the chair Include 2 handle rods(E) on the sides of the chair provided In such a way as to<br><br>
enable the occupant to grip the handles, comfortably. At the top end of the handle rod. Is the hand twister throttle(F) - both of the handle rods and hand twister throttle being provided with sprlng(G) (H) beneath to facilitate revolving motions, whenever desired. The two handles at the bottom end have a handle rod attachment (I) to facilitate removal of handle and replacement with other desired handles. The occupant of the chair can stretch legs and keep them on the pedestal below the seat OR on the foot twlsters(J) mounted on a foot twister mount(K), the foot twister having sprlngs(L) beneath for enabling rotation and forward and backward motion.<br>
DRAWING "2'.<br>
II. Posterior View of Twist Chair.<br>
Arm Rest labelled 1 and Back Rest labelled 2 herein correspond to C &amp; D of the Isometric View while Handle Rod and Hand Twister Throttle labelled 3 &amp; 4 herein synchronize with parts E &amp; F as appearing in the Isometric View. The labelled parts 5 Handle Spring and 6 Handle Rod Attachments are nothing but parts G &amp; I of the Isometric View and seen from a different perspective.<br>
It will be seen that labelled parts 7 and 8 Viz., Back Rest Spring assembly and Back Rest Hinge, are seen in this view but not depicted in the Isometric view. The backrest spring assembly facilitates movement of the spiral motions, multi directionaily. The labelled parts 9, 10 &amp; 11 viz.. Foot Twister, Foot Twister Mount, and Foot Twister Spring herein are the same parts as labelled parts 3, K &amp; L appearing in the Isometric View.<br><br>
