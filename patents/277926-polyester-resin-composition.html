3.   PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
 <br>
 <br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is  to be performed : -<br>
 <br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a polyester resin composition having a high crystallization rate and excellent moldability.<br>
Background Art<br>
Polyester resins such as polyethylene terephthalate, polymethylene terephthalate, polylactic acid, and the like are excellent in heat resistance, chemical resistance, dynamic characteristics, electric characteristics, and the like and also excellent in cost and performance, and are thus widely used as fibers and films in the industrial field. Further, the polyester resins are excellent in gas barrier property, sanitary property, and transparency and are thus widely used for beverage bottles, cosmetic and pharmaceutical containers, detergent and shampoo containers, and the like and further used for electrophotographic toners.<br>
In addition, polyethylene naphthalate is excellent in transparency and excellent in dynamic characteristics and ultraviolet barrier property as compared with polyethylene terephthalate, and particularly has low gas (oxygen, CO2, and water vapor) permeability. Therefore, polyethylene naphthalate is used as films for food packaging, pharmaceutical packaging, APS photographic films, electronic component materials, and the like.<br>
Further, polybutylene terephthalate is excellent in characteristics such as heat resistance, chemical resistance/ electric characteristics, dimensional stability, and moldability and is used for automotive electric components, electric and electronic components, and precision components for OA apparatuses.<br>
However, polyester resins generally have extremely low crystallization rates in spite<br>
of being crystalline resins, and thus have a very narrow range of molding conditions<br>
and difficulty in improving a processing cycle.   Therefore, use as molding materials<br>
-2-<br>
 <br>
is still restricted. Further, molded products prepared by molding polyester resins have low heat distortion temperatures, and thus there is the problem of limiting operating temperatures.<br>
A generally known method for improving the crystallization rates of polyester resins includes adding a nucleator such as a mineral, an organic acid metal salt, an inorganic salt, a metal oxide, or the like. General-purpose compounds used as the nucleator include metal salts, such as sodium benzoate, aluminum p-tert-butylbenzoate, aromatic phosphate metal salts, and the like; and compounds such as dibenzylidene sorbitol and the like. Further, there is known a method of adding a resin oligomer for improving mobility at a resin processing temperature.<br>
For example, Patent Document 1 proposes a method of adding a metal salt of an<br>
abietic acid compound in order to promote the crystallization rate of a polyester<br>
resin.	Patent     Document     2     discloses     a     method     of     adding     4-<br>
aminobenzenesulfonamide to an olefin resin. Patent Document 3 proposes a method of adding a phosphate metal salt and an aliphatic carboxylic acid metal salt to a crystalline polymer. Patent Document 4 proposes a method using a transition metal salt of a carboxylic acid as a nucleator for a composition containing polyethylene terephthalate and polyethylene naphthalate. Patent Document 5 proposes a method using an alkylene bis fatty acid amide and a quinacridone compound for a polyester of electrophotographic toner.<br>

Disclosure of Invention<br>
Problems to be Solved by the Invention<br>
However, the effect of improving the crystallization rate of a polyester resin by adding a generally known additive has not yet been satisfactory. The method of adding a resin oligomer such as ethylene glycol or the like contributes to the crystallization rate of a resin to some extent, but the dynamic strength of the resulting molded product may be decreased. Since an improvement in a molding cycle due to an improvement in a crystallization rate can increase the absolute amount of molded products which can be produced by an existing equipment, the development of a higher-performance nucleator is demanded.<br>
Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to resolve the problem of prior art and provide a polyester resin composition having an excellent crystallization rate. Means for Solving the Problems<br>

Reference Example 3	Comparative compound 9◦10)	128.8<br>
According to the results in Tables 1, 3, and 4, when a known nucleator was added to the polyester resin (Comparative Examples 1-2 to 1-8 in Table 1, Comparative Examples 3-2 to 3-6 in Table 3, and Comparative Example 4-2 in Table 4), the effect of improving the crystallization temperature was not satisfactory. On the other hand, when the sulfonamide compound metal salt according to the present invention was added to the polyester resin (Examples 1-1 to 1-13 in Table 1, Example 3-1 in Table 3, and Examples 4-1 to 4-3 in Table 4), an effect superior to those of existing nucleators was exhibited. In particular, it was confirmed that a sulfonamide compound which is not a metal salt has the significant effect of improving the crystallization temperature of the polyester resin composition (Example 1-1 and Comparative Example 1-4, Example 1-3 and Comparative Example 1-2, and Example 1-13 and Comparative Example 1-8). Since an improvement of the crystallization temperature contributes to an improvement of the heat distortion temperature of a molded product produced by molding the polyester resin, the molded product can be used in a desired high-temperature region.<br>
In addition, the results in Tables 2 and 3 confirmed that the polyester resin composition  using  the  sulfonamide compound  metal  salt has  a  significantly<br>
-29-<br>
 <br>
shortened time required for crystallization, and the polyester resin composition according to the present invention is an excellent resin composition having good moldability (Examples 2-1 to 2-3 and Example 3-1).<br>
Further, the results in Table 5 indicate that even wh£n a sulfonamide compound metal salt is used for an olefin resin (Reference Example 1), an excellent effect is not exhibited as compared with a known nucleator (Reference Example 3), and thus the sulfonamide compound metal salt of the present invention exhibits a particularly significant effect only on the polyester resin.<br>
Therefore, the present invention exhibits the effect of producing a polyester resin composition having a high crystallization temperature and excellent promotion of crystallization by using a sulfonamide compound metal salt for the polyester resin composition. Further, an increase in crystallization temperature of the polyester resin composition of the present invention can contribute to an increase in heat distortion temperature of a molded product produced by molding the polyester resin composition.<br>
