				<td>Use of mixtures of micropigments for preventing tanning and for lightening skin and hair<br>
The present invention relates to the use of mixtures of micronized organic UV filters for preventing tanning and for lightening human skin and hair and to their use in cosmetic and pharmaceutical formulations.<br>
It is known that certain organic UV filters, for example sparingly soluble benzotriazole or triazine compounds, have excellent UV filter properties if they are in micronized form.<br>
Particularly in Asiatic countries, there is great interest in light protection filters or mixtures of light protection filters which preserve the colour of the skin following solar irradiation and, moreover, are able to impart a lighter appearance to the skin.<br>
The object of the present invention is therefore to find micronized organic UV filters which prevent tanning of the skin and at the same time are able to lighten the skin.<br>
Surprisingly, we have now found that micronized organic UV filters or mixtures of at least two micronized UV filters can achieve this object.<br>

-	menthyl o-aminobenzoate.<br>
The UV filters listed above can be used according to the invention as individual compounds or also, preferably, as mixtures.<br>
Preference is given to using the following mixtures of organic UV filters:<br>
mixtures of methylenebisbenzotriazolyltetramethylbutylphenol and octyltriazone;<br>
mixtures of octyltriazone and methylenebisbenzotriazolyltetramethylbutylphenol;<br>
mixtures of 2-[(2,4-methoxy)phenyl]-4,6-bis[(2-hydroxy-4-methoxy)phenyl]-<br>
(1,3,5)triazine and methyienebisbenzotriazolyltetramethylbutylphenol;<br>
mixtures of methylenebisbenzotriazolyltetramethylbutylphenol and<br>
dioctylbutamidotriazone;<br>
mixtures of methylenebisbenzotriazolyltetramethylbutylphenol and octyl-2,2"-<br>
methylenebis[6-(2H-benzotriazol-2-yl)-4-methylphenol,<br>
mixtures of octyltriazone and trisresorcinyltriazine;<br>
^7<br><br><br><br><br>
mixtures of methylenebisbenzotriazolyltetramethylbutylphenol, dioctylbutamidotriazone and the compound of the formula (37).<br>
In the radicals defined above, Ci-Ci8alkyl are straight-chain or branched all<yl radicals for example methyl ethyl n-propyl isopropyl n-butyl sec-butyl tert-butyl amyl isoamyl or tert-amyl heptyl octyl isooctyl nonyl decyl undecyl dodecyl tetradecyl pentadecyl hexadecyl heptadecyl octadecyl.></yl>
C1C18Alkoxy radicals are straight-chain or branched alkyl radicals, for example methoxy, ethoxy, n-propoxy, isopropoxy, n-butoxy, sec-butoxy, tert-butoxy, amyloxy, isoamyloxy or tert-amyloxy, heptyloxy, octyloxy, isooctyloxy, nonyloxy, decyloxy, undecyloxy, dodecyloxy, tetradecyloxy, pentadecyloxy, hexadecyloxy, heptadecyloxy or octadecyloxy.<br>
C2-C18Aikenyl is, for example, aliyl, methallyl, isopropenyl, 2-butenyl, 3-butenyl, isobutenyl, n-penta-2,4-dienyl, 3-methylbut-2-enyl, n-oct-2-enyl, n-dodec-2-enyl, isododecenyl, n-dodec-2-enyl or n-octadec-4-enyl.<br>
The mixtures of micronized organic UV filters which can be used according to the invention can be prepared in different ways.<br>
Firstly, at least two of the abovementioned organic UV filters can be mixed as individual substances in the preparation process of the microparticles (micronization).<br>
Another preparation option involves thoroughly mixing the already micronized individual substances of the UV filters together.<br>
19<br><br>
A third preparation option involves melting together at least two of the abovementioned UV filters. Cooling the melt produces a homogeneous composite, which is micronized in the usual manner.<br>
The homogeneous composites of at least two organic UV filters are also provided by the invention.<br>
The invention further provides composites obtainable by fusing one or more inorganic micropigments into one or more organic UV filters.<br>
Examples of micropigments are, for example, TiO2, ZnO, iron oxides or other inorganic oxides, mica or other suitable inorganic minerals, and also Ti, alkaline earth metal or zinc salts of organic acids.<br>
In so doing, the undesired photocatalytic properties of some of these inorganic micropigments (TiO2, ZnO) can be simultaneously suppressed, and their positive properties can also be fully utilized.<br>
The abovementioned inorganic UV filters are advantageously fused into methylenebisbenzotriazolyltetramethylbutylphenol. The resulting composite is then micronized in the usual manner.<br>
The invention further provides composites obtainable by melting at least two electrically neutral organic UV filters with cationically or anionically charged compounds.<br>
For this, cationically or anionically charged compounds are melted with the corresponding organic, electrically neutral UV filters and then cooled. This process permits, in the subsequent micronization step, the preparation of organic UV filter pigments having a permanent finishing of a positive or negative charge. Such a finishing effectively prevents aggregation of the micronized particles in the sunscreen preparations which can occur in cases where the particle diameter is 
 <br>
Cationically or anionically charged compounds which can be used are UV filters and also other compounds which have one or more cationic or anionic groups, for example<br>
-	N,N,N-trimethyl-4-(2-oxoborn-3-ylidenemethyl)aniline methylsulfate;<br>
-	camphorbenzalkonium methosulfate;<br>
-	fatty amines;<br>
-	betaines, for example cocamidopropylbetaine;<br>
-	quats, for example ricinoleamidopropyltrimonium methosulfate, Quarternium 18 , or cetyltrimethylammonlum bromide;<br>
-	behenic acid and other organic acids, for example isostearic acid, citricmonoglyceride or sodium methyl cocoyi taurate;<br>
-	phospholipids, for example phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine or alkylamine oxide;<br>
-	ceramides and pseudoceramides and phytosterols.<br>
The last-named compounds impart an oleophobic finishing to the micronized UV filters.<br>
The proportion of cationic or anionic compounds in the composite is between 0.001 and 5% by weight, preferably 0.01 to 3% by weight, based on the weight of the UV filter(s).<br>
The invention further provides composites obtainable by melting at least one sparingly soluble or insoluble organic UV filter with antioxidants.<br>
For this, the sparingly soluble or insoluble organic UV filter(s) is/are melted together with antioxidants, cooled and then micronized in the usual manner.<br>
Suitable antioxidants which can be used according to the invention are all organic substances having scavenger properties which can be melted together with organic UV filters. This gives novel types of micropigments which simultaneously prevent tanning of the skin and offer antioxidative action on its surface. This property is desired for cosmetic sun protection since, under the influence of UV and light, harmful free radicals can be formed both in formulations and on the skin. These can, for example, lead to so-called Mallorca acne or to premature skin ageing. By finishing the micronized UV filters with antioxidants, not only is protection against UV damage and prevention of tanning achieved, but also protection against photochemical degradation of constituents in the sunscreen formulation.<br>
21<br><br>
The proportion of antioxidants in the composite is generally between 0.001 and 30% by weight, preferably 0.01 to 3% by weight, based on the weight of the UV filter(s).<br>
A content of antioxidants is particularly advantageous in micropigments which, in addition to organic UV filters, comprise the abovementioned photocatalytically active inorganic micropigments, for example titanium dioxide, zinc oxide (including coated) or other suitable inorganic oxides, for example iron oxide.<br>
Examples of antioxidants which may be listed are the following compounds: -   tocopherols, for example a-tocopherol (CAS 59-02-9), tocopheryl acetate, vitamin E succinate.<br><br><br><br>
-vanillin;<br>
-	ubiquinone;<br>
-	ferulic acid and derivatives;<br>
-	rutic acid and derivatives;<br><br>
-	urocanic acid and derivatives; and<br>
-	propolis.<br>
Preference is given to using the following mixtures of antioxidants and organic UV filters: mixtures of methylenebisbenzotriazolyltetramethylbutylphenol, octyltriazone, titanium dioxide and tocopherol,<br>
mixtures of 2,2"-methylenebis[6-(2H-benzotriazol-2-yl)-4-methylphenol, octyltriazone, trisresorcinyltriazine and vitamin E<br><br><br>
The invention further provides composites obtainable by fusing meltable cosmetic, vegetable and pharmaceutical active ingredients into organic UV filters.<br>
In general, micronized UV filters can be used as carriers of highly active substances, in particular cosmetic and/or pharmaceutical active substances. The advantage of such composites lies in the fact that it is possible for them to release the active substance(s) from the solid (slow release). A slow release also guarantees the uniform effectiveness of highly active active ingredients, for example antiinflammatories, care active ingredients or trace elements, for example Zn2+ or Mg2+ over the entire useful life of the UV pigments.<br>
Examples of active Ingredients which can be used and which may be mentioned are:<br>
-	active ingredients for antimicrobial finishing and simultaneous antiinflammatory action,<br>
for example triclosan or diclosan;<br>
-	antiinflammatory active ingredients, for example farnesol, panthenol or avocado oil;<br>
-	active ingredients having a deodorant or antiperspirant action, for example Zn<br>
ricinoleates and alkyl citrates,<br>
-	undecylenic acid and derivatives thereof (e.g. diethanolamides)<br>
-	zinc undecylate;<br>
-	pyrithiones, for example sodium pyrithione;<br><br>
-	fused-in fragrances or fragrance mixtures, for example menthol, geraniol etc., which<br>
impart a permanent odour which is uniform in intensity to these micropigments and the<br>
formulations which comprise them.<br>
To prepare the micronized organic UV filters or the micropigment mixtures, it is possible to use all known processes which are suitable for the preparation of microparticles, for example:<br>
-	wet grinding with a hard grinding medium, for example zirconium silicate and a protective surfactant or a protective polymer in water or a suitable organic solvent;<br>
-	spray drying from a suitable solvent, for example aqueous or organic suspensions containing solvent, or true solutions in water, ethanol, dichloroethane, toluene, N-methylpyrrolidone etc.;<br>
-	by expansion of supercritical liquids (e.g. CO2) in accordance with the RESS process (Rapid Expansion of Supercritical Solutions) in which the UV filter(s) is/are dissolved or expansion of liquid carbon dioxide together with a solution of one or more UV filters in a suitable organic solvent;<br>
-	by reprecipitation from suitable solvents, including supercritical liquids (GASR process = Gas Anti-Solvent Recrystallization / PCA process = Precipitation with Compressed Antisolvents).<br>
Grinding apparatuses which can be used for the preparation of the micronized organic UV absorbers according to the invention are, for example, a jet, ball, vibratory or hammer mill, preferably a high-speed stirred mill. Grinding preferably takes place using a grinding auxiliary, for example an alkylated vinylpyrrolidone polymer, a vinylpyrrolidone/vinyl acetate copolymer, an acyl glutamate, an alkyl polyglucoside, ceteareth-25 or, in particular, a phospholipid.<br>
The resulting micropigments or mixtures of micropigments usually have an average particle size of from 0.02 to 2 nm, preferably 0.05 to 1.5 nm, and very particularly from 0.1 to 1.0 nm.<br><br>
Because of their lipophilicity, they can, alone or together with other soluble organic UV absorbers, be readily incorporated into oil- and fat-containing cosmetic formulations, for example oils, O/W or W/0 emulsions, wax pencils or gels, by known methods.<br>
Surprisingly, formulations are obtained which have equal or improved protective action using less or even no soluble UV absorbers.<br>
The invention further provides a cosmetic formulation comprising a mixture of micropigments, if desired one or more antioxidants and/or inorganic pigments and/or a cationic or anionic compound, and cosmetically compatible carriers or auxiliaries.<br>
Cosmetic formulations according to the invention include various cosmetic compositions. In particular, the following compositions are, for example, suitable:<br>
skincare compositions, for example skin washes and cleansers in the form of bar or<br>
liquid soaps, syndets or washing pastes,<br>
bath preparations, for example liquid (foam baths, milks, shower preparations) or solid<br>

50 parts of Methylene Bis-benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol and 50 parts of Octyl Triazone are ground together using a grinding medium of zirconium silicate sand, a protective surfactant (Alkyl Polyglucoside) and water in a bead mill to give a mixed micropigment having a d50 of 190 nm. After the grinding medium has been separated off, the suspension of the mixed micropigment can be used to prepare sunscreen formulations.<br>
Example 2:<br>
32 parts of Octyl Triazone, 1 part of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide and 66 parts of Methylene Bis-benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol are homogeneously melted together. The mixture is rapidly cooled to room temperature, and the solidified melt is comminuted mechanically (beater mill). This resulting powder is slurried in water, Decyl Glycoside is added, and the mixture is micronized together with a grinding auxiliary ("heavy sand") to a particle size diameter d50 of 200 nm. After the grinding auxiliary has been removed, an aqueous suspension of the micronized UV absorber composite is obtained. This suspension is rendered slightly acidic with citric acid and can be used for the preparation of cosmetic and pharmaceutical formulations.<br>
Example 3:<br>
25 parts of 2-[(2,4-methoxy)phenyl]-4,6-bis[(2-hydroxy-4-methoxy)phenyi]-(1,3,5)-triazine, 74 parts of Methylene Bis-benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol and 1 part of Tetrakis[methylene-3(3",5"-di-t-butyl-4"-hydroxyphenyl)propionate]methane are homogeneously fused together. The mixture is rapidly cooled to room temperature, and the solidified melt is comminuted mechanically (beater mill). This resulting powder is slurried in water, firstly Decyl Glycoside is added, then, after continued grinding, Ceteareth-25, and the mixture is micronized together with a grinding auxiliary ("heavy sand") to a particle size diameter dso of 190 nm. After the grinding auxiliary has been separated off, an aqueous suspension of the micronized UV absorber composite is obtained, which can be used for the preparation of cosmetic and pharmaceutical formulations.<br><br>
25 parts of Dioctyl Butamido Triazone are dissolved in 75 parts of molten Methylene Bi; benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol. The mixture is cooled rapidly, comminuted mechanically to give a fine powder and then ground with a grinding medium of zirconiur silicate sand, a protective surfactant (phospholipid) and water to give a micropigment having a dso of 300 nm. The micropigment suspension separated off from the grinding medium is used for the preparation of sunscreen formulations.<br>
Example 5:<br>
24 parts of Octyl Triazone, 5 parts of Titanium Dioxide and one part of Tocopherol are mixed into 70 parts of molten fvlethylene Bis-benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol. The mixture is cooled rapidly, comminuted mechanically to give a fine powder and then grou with a grinding medium of zirconium silicate sand, a protective surfactant (Alkyl Polyglucoside) and water to give a micropigment. The micropigment suspension separai off from the grinding medium is used for the preparation of sunscreen formulations.<br>

Example 49: Prevention of the increase in skin tanning by a micronized UV absorber Methylene Bis-benzotriazolvl Tetramethylbutylphenol<br>
Method:<br>
20 yolunteers of direct Asian origin (father and mother) who have not been directly exposed<br>
to the sun for the past 3 months, to whom an explanation of the study has been given, from<br>
whom a declaration of consent has been obtained and who have satisfied the inclusion<br>
conditions, are treated twice daily on the test sites on the upper thigh for three weeks with a<br>
cream containing 2,2"-methylenebis(6-(2H-benzotriazol-2-yl)-4-(1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl)-<br>
phenol or with a placebo cream.<br>
The volunteers are irradiated on the test sites on the upper thigh 3x weekly with 0.2 to 05<br>
MED UVAB.<br>
The first application of the preparations takes place after the first irradiation. Evaluation and<br>
irradiation are carried out after each application of the test products. Comparable untreated<br>
irradiated, or untreated nonirradiated areas serve as reference.<br>
The colour values of the test fields are documented in each case using a Minolta CM-5G8i<br>
camera as L*a*b* values in accordance with DIN 5033, ISO 7724/1, JIS Z8722.<br>
The colour and lightness changes are determined for each subject and ascertained as the<br>
difference between the respective skin colour of the untreated, nonirradiated reference area<br>
and the test areas. These values are averaged over all subjects and given as L*, a* and b*<br>
values.<br><br>
Test preparations:<br>
(A): Composition comprising 6% of 2,2"-Methylenebis(6-(2H-benzotriazoi-2-yl)-4-(1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl)phenol), Water, Octyl stearate, Coco glycerides, Propylene glycol, Methoxy-PEG-22/Dodecyl glycol copolymer, PEG-22/Dodecyl glycol copolymer, Hydroxyoctacosanyl hydroxystearate, Mineral oil, Phenoxyethanol &amp; Parabens, Magnesium sulfate heptahydrate, Dimethlcone, Allantoin.<br>
(B): Composition comprising 3% of 2,2"-Methylenebis(6-(2H-benzotriazol-2-yl)-4-(1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl)phenol), Water, Octyl stearate. Coco glycerides, Propylene glycol, Methoxy-PEG-22/Dodecyl glycol copolymer, PEG-22/Dodecyl glycol copolymer, Hydroxyoctacosanyl hydroxystearate. Mineral oil, Phenoxyethanol &amp; Parabens, Magnesium sulfate heptahydrate, Dimethicone, Allantoin.<br>
(C): Placebo comprising Water, Octyl stearate, Coco glycerides. Propylene glycol, Methoxy-PEG-22/Dodecyl glycol copolymer, PEG-22/Dodecyl glycol copolymer, Hydroxyoctacosanyl hydroxystearate, Mineral oil, Phenoxyethanol &amp; Parabens, Magnesium sulfate heptahydrate, Dimethicone, Allantoin.<br>
L*a*b* values compared with nonirradiated skin following repeated UVAB irradiation (3 X weekly) and in the case of the application of compositions (A) and (B).<br>
Preparation	Lightness L*	Red component a*      Yellow component b"<br>
Number of irradiations	3	6	9369369<br>
Placebo	-5.32	-12.01	-14.01	4.90	2.33	0.52	3.09	6.82	7.93<br>
(B)	-1.05	-5.23	-7.13	0.45	0.77	-0.03	1.11	2.63	3.49<br>
(A)	2.18	8.26	11.40	0.24	0.45	0.39	-0.38	-0.69	-0.21<br>
Irradiated untreated	-5.19	-12.38	-14.55	5.13	1.77	-0.19	2.64	6.39	7.44<br>
Discussion of the results:<br>
Lightness<br>
While the placebo-treated and the untreated irradiated areas decrease in lightness to<br>
roughly the same extent, i.e. become darker, this effect is considerably less in the case of<br><br>
the application of the composition (B) over the time. In the case of the application of composition (A), lightening of the skin Is found.<br>
Reddening<br>
The red component of the irradiated skin is most intense after 3 irradiations and drops back to the normal value by the end of the irradiations. The Increase in the red component corresponds to the development of a UV-induced erythema, which arises only to a low degree in the case of the application of compositions (A) or (B).<br>
Yellow component<br>
The yellow component increases both In the case of the application of placebo and in the untreated irradiated control area. The increase is much less In the case of the application of composition (B) and is prevented in the case of the application of composition (A).<br><br><br>
