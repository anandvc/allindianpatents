AN OPTICAL FIBER<br>
SUMITOMO ELECTRIC INDUSTRIES LTD., a Japanese company of 5-33 Kitahama, 4-chome, Chuo-ku, Osaka-shi, Osaka, 541-0041, Japan,<br><br>

The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
The present invention relates to an optical fiber. Technical Field<br>
The present invent'ion relates to an optical fiber applicable to a transmission line in optical communications, and an optical transmission system including this optical fiber. Background Art<br>
Conventionally, as a transmission line in optical communications, standard single-mode optical fibers having a zero-dispersion wavelength in a 1.3-μm  wavelength band (1280 run to 1320 nm) have mainly been utilized. The transmission loss resulting from the main material (silica) of such an optical fiber has been known to become the lowest ina 1.55-μm wavelengthband (1530nm to 1565nm) . Inaddition, optical fiber amplifiers using an Er-doped optical fiber<br>
- can amplify light in the 1.55-μm wavelength band at a high efficiency. For such a reason, dispersion-shifted optical fibers designed so as to have a zero-dispersion wavelength<br>
in the 1.55-μm wavelength band are applied to transmission lines in wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) communications for transmitting a plurality of wavelengths of signal light. As for a light source for sending out signal light, device technologies for enabling light in the 1.3-μm wavelength band and light in the 1.55-μm wavelength band<br><br><br>
to be outputted have conventionally been established. Disclosure of the Invention<br>
The inventors have studied the prior art mentioned above and, as a result, found problems as follows. Namely, in the case where light in the 1. 3-/im wavelength band is transmitted while a dispersion-shifted optical fiber having a<br>
zero-dispersion wavelength in the 1.55-μm wavelength band is used as an optical transmission line, the absolute value of dispersion becomes so large that WDM communications cannot be carried out in a wide band. Also, when signal light in<br>
the 1.55-μm wavelength band is transmitted through such a dispersion-shifted optical fiber, the absolute value of dispersion becomes so small that four-wave mixing, which is one of nonlinear optical phenomena, is likely to occur. In the case where light in the 1.3-μm wavelength band is transmitted while a standard single-mode optical fiber having<br>
a zero-dispersion wavelength in the 1.3-μm wavelength band is used as an optical transmission line, on the other hand, the absolute value of dispersion becomes so small that four-wave mixing, which is one of nonlinear optical phenomena, is likely to occur. Also, when signal light in the 1.55-μm wavelength band is transmitted through such a single-mode optical fiber, the absolute value of dispersion becomes so large that WDM communications cannot be carried out in a wide band.<br>
For this matter, attempts have been made to develop<br><br>
optical fibers for suppressing the occurrence of dispersion over a wide wavelength band (see, for example, K. Okamoto et al., "Zero total in single-mode optical fibers over an extended spectral range," Radio Science, Volume 17, Number 1, pages 31-36, January-February 1982). For example, an optical fiber having a low dispersion value over a wide wavelength band has been proposed by yielding a large relative refractive index difference of 2.4% between its cladding region and core region and a small diameter of 3.5 p.m in the core region. However, it is difficult to make such an optical fiber having a very large relative refractive index difference between the cladding region and core region, and its transmission loss is large. In an optical fiber whose core region has a smaller diameter, on the other hand, the effective area becomes smaller, and nonlinear optical phenomena are likely to occur.<br>
In order to overcome problems such as those mentioned above, it is an object of the present invention to provide an optical fiber which enables efficient transmission of both of signal light in the 1.3-μm wavelength band and signal light in the 1.55-μm wavelength band, and an optical transmission system including the same.<br>
The optical fiber according to the present invention is an optical fiber which enables efficient transmission of both of signal light in the 1.3-μm wavelength band and signal light in the 1.55-μm wavelength band, the optical<br><br>
fiber having only one zero-dispersion wavelength within a wavelength range of 1.20 μm to 1.60 /im and having a positive dispersion slope at the zero-dispersion wavelength. Here, this zero-dispersion wavelength lies within a wavelength range of 1.37 μm to 1.50 μm sandwiched between the 1.3-μm wavelength band and the 1.55-μm wavelength band . Also, the above-mentioned dispersion slope preferably has an absolute value of 0.10 ps/nm2/km or less at the above-mentioned zero-dispersion wavelength (preferably<br>
0.06 ps/nm2/km or less at a wavelength of 1.55 μm) ,   and monotonously changes {e.g., monotonously increases) at least in a wavelength range of 1.30 μm to 1.55 μm.<br>
Thus, since this optical fiber has a zero-dispersion wavelength within the wavelength range of 1.37 μm to 1.50 μm including a wavelength of 1.38 μm at which an increase in transmission loss caused by OH absorption is seen, dispersion occurs to a certain extent in the vicinity of the 1.3-μm wavelength band and in the vicinity of the 1.55-μm wavelength band. As a consequence, the optical fiber comprises a structure in which four-wave mixing is hard to<br>
occur even when the signal light in the 1.3-μm wavelength band and the signal light in the 1.50-μm wavelength band propagate therethrough.<br>
In the case where a thulium-doped fiber amplifier having<br>
an amplification band in a 1.47-μm wavelength band is utilized, the zero-dispersion wavelength is more preferably<br><br>
set within a wavelength range of 1.37 μm to 1.43 μm. It is because of the fact that the transmission band can further be widened if the zero-dispersion wavelength is aligned with<br>
a skirt of the OH absorption peak (1.38 μm) . In the case where the above-mentioned OH absorption peak is kept low by dehydration processing or the like, so as to utilize the<br>
wavelength band including the wavelength of 1.38 μm  as its signal light wavelength band, on the other hand, the zero-dispersion wavelength may be set within a wavelength range of longer than 1.45 μm but not longer than 1.50 μm in order to intentionally generate dispersion in the above-mentioned wavelength band.<br>
In the optical fiber, while the dispersion slope monotonously increases, the absolute value of the dispersion slope at its zero-dispersion wavelength is 0.10 ps/nm2/km or less, and the dispersion slope at a wavelength of 1.55 Urn. is preferably 0.06 ps/nm2/km or less, whereby the dispersion in the 1.3-μm wavelength band and the dispersion in the 1.55-μm wavelength band are homogenized. Here, each of the absolute value of dispersion in the 1.3-μm wavelength band and the absolute value of dispersion in the 1.55-μm wavelength band is 6 ps/nm/km or more but 12 ps/nm/km or less.<br>
As mentioned above, the optical fiber according to the present invent ion realizes efficient optical communications in both of the 1.3-μm wavelength band and the 1.55-μm<br><br>
wavelength band . From the viewpoint of guaranteeing a single mode, the case where the cutoff wavelength is 1.3 μm or shorter while the transmission line length is several hundreds of meters or less is preferable since only the ground-mode light can propagate in each of the 1.3-μm wavelength band and the 1.55-μm wavelength band. Also, in view of the dependence of cutoff wavelength on distance, no practical problem occurs in optical transmission over a relatively long distance (a transmission line length of several kilometers or less) even if the cutoff wavelength is 1.45 μm or shorter (in the case where it is longer than the signal light wavelength) . From the viewpoint of reducing the bending loss, on the other hand, there are cases where the bending loss increases remarkably when the cutoff wavelength is shorter than 1.0 μm. As a consequence, the cutoff wavelength is preferably 1.05 /im or more, more preferably 1.30 μm or more. Further, in order to enable efficient optical<br>
transmission in the 1.3-μm wavelength band and 1.55-μm wavelength band, the optical fiber according to the present invention has a bending loss which becomes 0.5 dB or less, preferably 0.06 dB or less, per turn when wound at a diameter of 32 mm at a wavelength of 1.55 μm, and has an effective area A., which becomes 45 μm or more, preferably greater than 49 μm at a wavelength of 1.55 μm. Also, the amount of increase in transmission loss caused by OH absorption at a wavelength of 1.38 /im in the optical fiber is 0 . 1 dB/km<br><br>
or less. In particular, if the amount of increase in transmission loss caused by OH absorption at a wavelength of 1.38 μm is 0.1 dB/km or less, then a wavelength band in the vicinity of this wavelength of 1.38 μ.m can be utilized for a signal light wavelength band. In this case, in order to intentionally generate dispersion in the wavelength band<br>
in the vicinity of the wavelength of 1.38 urn. (in order to suppress four-wave mixing) , the zero-dispersion wavelength may be set within a wavelength range of longer than 1.45 /lm  but not longer than 1.50 μm<br>
Here, the effective area Aeff is given, as shown in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. HEI 8-248251 (EP 0 724 171 A2), by the following expression (1):<br><br>
where E is the electric field accompanying the propagated light, and r is the radial distance from the core center. The optical fiber according to the present invention has a refractive index prof ile in which the maximum and minimum values of relative refractive index difference with reference to the refractive index of pure silica (silica which is not intentionally doped with impurities) are 1% or less and -0 . 5% or more, respectively. In such a refractive index profile, the relative refractive index difference of a high refractive index region doped with Ge element, for example, with respect to pure silica is 1% or less, whereas the relative refractive<br><br>
index difference of a low refractive index region doped with F element, for example, with respect to pure silica is -0.5% or more, whereby its manufacture (refractive index control by doping with impurities) is easy, and the transmission loss can be lowered. Here, the minimum value of relative refractive index difference with reference to the refractive index of pure silica is preferably -0.2% or more, more preferably greater than -0.15% from the viewpoint of facilitating the manufacture of the optical fiber.<br>
The optical fiber having various characteristics such as those mentioned above can be realized by various configurations. Namely, a first configuration of the optical fiber can be realized by a structure comprising a core region which extends along a predetermined axis and has a predetermined refractive index, and a cladding region provided on the outer periphery of the core region. The optical fiber of the first configuration may further comprise a depressed cladding structure. The depressed cladding structure is realized when the above-mentioned cladding region is constituted by an inner cladding, provided on the outer periphery of the core region, having a lower refractive index than the core region; and an outer cladding, provided on the outer periphery of the inner cladding, having a refractive index higher than that of the inner cladding but lower than that of the core region.<br>
As with the first configuration, a second configuration<br><br>
of the optical fiber comprises a core region and a cladding region provided on the outer periphery of the core region. However, the core region is constituted by a first core having a predetermined refractive index; and a second core, provided on the outer periphery of the first core, having a lower refractive index than the first core. In the case where the optical fiber of the second configuration comprises a depressed cladding structure, the cladding region is constituted by an inner cladding, in contact with the outer periphery of the second core, having a lower refractive index than the second core; and an outer cladding, provided on the outer periphery of the inner cladding, having a refractive index higher than that of the inner cladding but lower than that of the second core.<br>
As with the first configuration, a third configuration of the optical fiber comprises a core region extending along a predetermined axis and a cladding region provided on the outer periphery of the core region, in particular, the core region comprises a first core having a predetermined refractive index; a second core, provided on the outer periphery of the first core, having a lower refractive index than the first core; and a third core, provided on the outer periphery of the second core, having a higher refractive index than the second core. In the case where the optical fiber of the third configuration comprises a depressed cladding structure, the cladding region is constituted by<br><br>
an inner cladding, in contact with the outer periphery of the third core, having a lower refractive index than the third core; and an outer cladding, provided on the outer periphery of the inner cladding, having a refractive index higher than that of the inner cladding but lower than that of the third core.<br>
When the third configuration mentioned above is employed, it becomes easier to obtain an optical fiber having a lowdispersion slopeof 0 . 06 ps/nm2/kmor less at a wavelength<br>
of 1.55 μm  in particular.<br>
Further, a fourth configuration of the optical fiber also comprises a core region extending along a predetermined axis and a cladding region provided on the outer periphery of the core region. In particular, the core region comprises a first core having a predetermined refractive index; a second core, provided on the outer periphery of the first core, having a higher refractive index than the first core. In the case where the optical fiber of the fourth configuration comprises a depressedcladding structure, the cladding region is constituted by an inner cladding, in contact with the outer periphery of the second core, having a lower refractive index than the second core; and an outer cladding, provided on the outer periphery of the inner cladding, having a refractive index higher than that of the inner cladding but lower than that of the second core.<br>
A fifth configuration of the optical fiber comprises<br><br>
a core region extending along a predetermined axis and a cladding region provided on the outer periphery of the core region. In particular, the core region comprises a first core having a predetermined refractive index; a second core, provided on the outer periphery of the first core, having a higher refractive index than the first core; a third core, provided on the outer periphery of the second core, having a lower refractive index than the second core; and a fourth core, provided on the outer periphery of the third core, having a higher refractive index than the third core. In this fifth mode of optical fiber, the cladding region has a lower refractive index than the fourth core.<br>
The optical transmission system according to the present invention is realized by the optical fiber having such a configuration as those mentioned above. Specifically, the optical transmission system according to the present invention comprises, at least, a first transmitter for<br>
outputting first light in the 1.3-μm wavelength band, a second transmitter for outputting second light in the 1.55-<br>
p.m wavelength band, a multiplexer for multiplexing the first light outputted from the first transmitter and the second light outputted from the second transmitter, and an optical fiber comprising a configuration mentioned above and having one end thereof optically connected to the first multiplexer . As a result of this structure, the optical fiber transmits each of the first light and second light multiplexed by the<br><br>
multiplexer. According to the optical transmission system having such a structure, the first light in the 1.3-μm wavelength band outputted from the transmitter is made incident on the above-mentioned optical fiber by way of the multiplexer and propagates through the optical fiber toward a receiving system. On the other hand, the second light in<br>
the 1.55-μm wavelength band outputted from the second transmitter is made incident on the optical fiber by way of the multiplexer and propagates through the optical fiber toward the receiving system. Also, as mentioned above, the optical fiber applied to the optical transmission line comprises a structure enabling efficient optical communications in each of the 1.3-μm wavelength band and 1.55-μm wavelength band, whereby the optical transmission system enables large-capacity communications when the optical fiber having such a special structure is employed therein.

Best Modes for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
	In the following, embodiments of the optical fiber and<br>
optical transmission system according to the present invention will be explained with reference to Figs. 1A to 2B, 3 to 16, and 17A to 18B . Among the drawings, constituents identical to each other will be referred to with numerals<br>
        or letters identical to each other without repeating their overlapping explanations.<br>
First, Fig. 1A is a graph showing a transmission loss characteristic of an optical fiber according to the present invention with respect to wavelength, whereas Fig. IB is<br>
        a graph showing a dispersion characteristic of the optical fiber according to the present invention with respect to wavelength.<br>
The optical fiber according to the present invention has only one zero-dispersion wavelength within a wavelength<br>
        range of 1.20 μm to 1.60 μm, whereas this zero-dispersion wavelength exists within a wavelength range of 1.37 μm to 1.50 μm. Since a transmission loss due to OH absorption occurs near a wavelength of 1.38 μm as shown in the graph of Fig. 1A (see, for example, KAZUHIRO NOGUCHI et al., "Loss<br>
        Increase for Optical Fibers Exposed to Hydrogen Atmosphere, " JOURNAL OF LIGHTWAVE TECHNOLOGY, VOL. LT-3, NO. 2, APRIL<br><br><br>
1985), it is not always favorable to apply signal light in the vicinity of this wavelength to optical communications. Therefore, as shown in Fig. 1B, the zero-dispersion wavelength in the optical fiber according to the present invention is set within a wavelength range of 1.37 μm to 1.43 μm including the wavelength of 1.38 μm at which the transmission loss due to OH absorption occurs, but is kept from being set in the vicinity of the 1. 3-μm wavelength band and 1.5-μm wavelength band sandwiching this wavelength band. When the wavelength band including the wavelength of 1.38 μm is utilized as a signal light wavelength band, the zero-dispersion wavelength may be set within a range of longer<br>
than 1.45 μm but not longer than 1.50 μm. Thus, the 1.3-μm wavelength band and 1.55-μm wavelength band deviated from a predetermined wavelength band including the zero-dispersion wavelength are utilized as a signal wavelength band in the optical fiber according to the present invention, so that dispersion is intentionally generated in these wavelength bands, while the occurrence of four-wave mixing is effectively suppressed. When the zero-dispersion<br>
wavelength is set within the range of 1.37 μm to 1.43 μm as mentioned above, the transmission band can further be widened by use of a thulium-doped fiber amplifier whose amplification band lies in a 1.41-ΜM wavelength band. In the case where the above-mentioned OH absorption peak is kept low by dehydration processing or the like, so as to<br><br>
utilize the wavelength band including the wavelength of 1.38 μm as a signal light wavelength band, on the other hand, the zero-dispersion wavelength may be set within a wavelength<br>
range of longer than 1.45 μm  but not longer than 1.50 μm in order to intentionally generate dispersion in the above-mentioned wavelength band.<br>
Also, the optical fiber according to the present invention has a dispersion with an absolute value of 0.10 ps/nmVkm or less at the above-mentioned zero-dispersion wavelength (preferably 0.06 ps/nm2/km or less at a wavelength of 1.55 μm), thereby being able to realize homogenization of the respective dispersions in the 1.3-μm wavelength band and 1.55-μm wavelength band. Here, in this optical fiber, each of the absolute value of dispersion D1.3 at a wavelength of 1.3 μm and the absolute value of dispersion D1.55 at a wavelength of 1.55 μm is 6 ps/nm/km or more but 12 ps/nm/km or less. Even in view of the fact that a standard single-mode optical fiber having a zero-dispersion wavelength in the 1.3-μm wavelength band has a dispersion value of about 17 ps/nm/km in the 1.55-μm wavelength band, the optical fiber according to the present invention has a sufficiently small absolute value of dispersion (12 ps/nm/km or less) in each<br>
of the 1.3-μm wavelength band and 1.55- μm wavelength band, thus being more suitably utilized in optical communications . Since dispersion occurs to an appropriate extent ( 6 ps/nm/km or more) in these wavelength bands, on the other hand,<br><br>
four-wave mixing can effectively be kept from occurring.<br>
Further, from the viewpoint of guaranteeing a single<br>
mode, the optical fiber according to the present invention<br>
preferably has a cutoff wavelength of 1.3μm or shorter when its transmission length is not longer than several hundreds of meters.  Inthiscase, only ground-mode light canpropagate<br>
in each of the 1.3-μm wavelength band and 1.55-μm wavelength band. Also, in view of the dependence of cutoff wavelength<br>
on distance, the cutoff wavelength may be 1.45 μm or shorter in optical transmission over a relatively long distance (a transmission line length of several kilometers or less). In this specification, the cutoff wavelength is that of LPll mode measured in a state where an optical fiber having a length of 2 m is wound by only one turn at a radius of 140 mm as defined in a CCITT standard. From the viewpoint of reducing the bending loss, there are cases where the bending loss remarkably increases when the cutoff wavelength is shorter than 1.0μm. Therefore, the cutoff wavelength is preferably 1.05 μm or more, more preferably 1.30 μm or more. As mentioned above, the optical fiber according to the present invention is a single-mode optical fiber in which a zero-dispersion wavelength is set within a wavelength range deviated from both of the 1.3-μm wavelength band and 1.55-μm wavelength band, while the dispersion value is small in each wavelength band, whereby it is suitable as a transmission medium in an optical communication system utilizing a<br><br>
plurality of wavelength bands.<br>
The optical fiber according to the present invention preferably has a dispersion slope monotonously changing within a wavelength range of 1 . 30 μm  to 1.55 μm (monotonously increasing in the case shown in Fig. IB). This case is preferable not only in that only one zero-dispersion wavelength can be set within a wavelength range of 1.20 pm to 1.60 μm,  but also in that the dispersion in each of the 1.3-μm wavelength band and 1.55-μm wavelength band would not approach zero (because nonlinear optical phenomena are likely to occur when the dispersion approaches zero).<br>
The optical fiber according to the present invention preferably has a bending loss of 0.5 dB/turn or less, more<br>
preferably 0.06 dB/turn or less at a wavelength of 1.55 μm when wound at a diameter of 32 mm. In this case, since the bending loss is sufficiently small, the increase in loss caused by cabling and the like can effectively be suppressed. Here, this bending loss (dB/turn) is a value obtained when the transmission loss of light having a wavelength of 1.55 μm concerning an optical fiber wound about a mandrel having a diameter of 32 mm is converted into a loss value per turn. In theoptical fiber according to thepresent invention, the effective area A6 at a wavelength of 1.55 μm is preferably 45 μm2 or more, more preferably greater than 49 μm. This value is on a par with or greater than the effective area in a conventional dispersion-shifted optical fiber having<br><br>
a zero-dispersion wavelength in the 1.55-μm wavelength band , so that the optical intensity per unit cross-sectional area decreases, whereby the occurrence of nonlinear optical phenomena such as four-wave mixing is effectively suppressed . In the optical fiber according to the present invention, the amount of increase a   in transmission loss caused by OH absorption at a wavelength of 1.38 μm is preferably 0 .1 dB/km or less.  It is because of the fact that the wavelength band applicable to optical communications is widened thereby, so as to enable larger-capacity optical communications.  In the case where a wavelength band including a wavelength of 1.38 μm  is utilized as a signal light wavelength band, the zero-dispersion wavelength is preferably designed to lie within a wavelength range of longer than 1.45 μm but not longer than 1.50 μm deviated from the above-mentioned wavelength band, in order to suppress the occurrence of nonlinear optical phenomena.<br>
Preferably, the optical fiber according to the present invention has a refractive index profile in which the maximum and minimum values of relative refractive index difference with reference to the refractive index of pure silica ( silica which is not intentionally doped with impurities) are 1% or less and -0.5% or more, respectively. Since the relative refractive index difference of a high refractive index region doped with Ge element, for example, with respect to pure silica is 1% or less, whereas the relative refractive index<br><br>
difference of a low refractive index region doped with F element, for example, with respect to pure silica is -0.5% or more, an optical transmission medium which is relatively easy to make and has a low transmission loss is obtained. For further facilitating the manufacture, the minimum value of relative refractive index difference with reference to the refractive index of pure silica is preferably -0.2% or more, more preferably greater than -0.15%.<br>

(Twenty-second Embodiment)<br>
As in the sixth embodiment shown in Fig. 7, the twenty-second embodiment of the optical fiber according to the present invention has a refractive index profile of a depressed cladding structure, while having a low dispersion slope. In the refractive index profile of the twenty-second<br>

Fig. 11 is a table listing various characteristics of respective optical fibers according to the above-mentioned first to thirteenth embodiments. Also, Fig. 12 is a table listing various characteristics of respective optical fibers according to the above-mentioned fourteenth to twenty-second<br><br>
embodiments. As shown in these tables, each of the optical fibers according to the first to twenty-second embodiments has only one zero-dispersion wavelength within a wavelength range of 1.20 μm to 1.60 μm, whereas this zero-dispersion wavelength lies within a wavelength range of 1.37 μm to 1.50 μm.    in particular, the zero-dispersion wavelength lies within a wavelength range of 1.37 μm. to 1.43 μm in the third, fourth, sixth to ninth, eleventh to fourteenth, and seventeenth to twenty-second embodiments, whereas it lies within a wavelength range of longer than 1.45 μm but not longer than 1.55 μm  in the second, fifth, fifteenth, and sixteenth embodiments. In each of the embodiments, the absolute value of dispersion slope at the zero-dispersion wavelength is 0.10 ps/nm2/km or less, whereas the cutoff wavelength is 1.3 μrn or shorter. Therefore, each of these optical fibers is of a single mode having no zero-dispersion wavelength at the 1.3-μm wavelength band nor 1.5-μm wavelength band, while the dispersion at each of these wavelength bands is kept low, thereby being suitable for optical communications utilizing a plurality of wavelength<br>
bands. At a wavelength of 1.55 μm, the first, second, sixth, thirteenth to fifteenth, and eighteenth to twenty-second embodiments have a dispersion slope of 0.06 ps/nm2/km, with the eighteenth to twenty-second embodiments having a further lower dispersion slope in particular.<br>
Also, in each of the optical fibers according to the<br><br>
first to twenty-second embodiments, the dispersion slope monotonously changes in a wavelength range of 1.30 μm  to 1.55 μm,   whereas the absolution value of dispersion at wavelengths of 1.3 μm  and 1.55 /urn  is 12 ps/nm/km or less. Therefore, the absolute value of dispersion in the 1.3-<br>
μm wavelength band and 1.55-μm wavelength band in each of these optical fibers is sufficiently smaller than the dispersion value (about 17 ps/nm/km) in the 1.55-μm wavelength band of a conventional standard single-mode optical fiber having a zero-dispersion wavelength in the 1.3-μm wavelength band. If the dispersion value up to that (about 17 ps/nm/km) in the 1.55-μm wavelength band of the above-mentioned standard single-mode optical fiber is permissible in an optical transmission system as a whole, then each of the respective optical fibers according to the first to twenty-second embodiments is suitably utilized in optical communications having a signal light wavelength band within a range of 1.2 μm.  to 1.7 μm.<br>
Further, each of the optical fibers according to the first to twenty-second embodiments has a bending loss of<br>
0.5 dB or less per turn at a wavelength of 1.55 μm  when wound at a diameter of 32 mm, with this bending loss being 0.06 dB or less in the first to sixth, eleventh, thirteenth to seventeenth, nineteenth, and twentieth embodiments in particular, and thus is preferable in that it can effectively suppress the increase in loss caused by cabling and the like.<br><br>
Also, each of the optical fibers according to the first to twenty-second embodiments has an effective area Aeff of 45 Urn2 or more at a wavelength of 1.55 urn, with the effective area Aeff in the first, third to fourteenth, and sixteenth to twenty-second embodiments exceeding 49 μm2 in particular, which is on a par with or greater than the effective area of conventional dispersion-shifted optical fibers. Hence, the light propagating through the optical fiber has a lower intensity per unit cross-sectional area, whereby nonlinear optical phenomena such as four-wave mixing can effectively be suppressed.<br>
In the refractive index profiles 150 to 950 shown in Figs. 2B, and 3 to 10, the maximum and minimum values of relative refractive index difference with reference to the refractive index of the reference region (the cladding region 120, or the outer cladding if the cladding region 120 has a depressed cladding structure) of pure silica (silica which is not intentionally doped with impurities) is 1% or less and -0.5% or more, respectively, except for the above-mentioned thirteenth embodiment. Though the thirteenth embodiment comprises a structure in which the cladding region 120 is doped with fluorine so as to relatively enhance the difference in refractive index between the core region made of pure silica and the cladding region, the maximum value of relative refractive index difference of the core region 110 with respect to the cladding region 120 is 1%<br><br>
or less even in this embodiment. While a high refractive index region is realized by doping with Ge element, for example; since its relative refractive index difference is 1% or less, the making of this optical fiber (refractive index control by doping with impurities) is relatively easy, and its transmission loss becomes smaller. While a low refractive index region, on the other hand, is realized by doping with F element, for example; since its relative refractive index difference is -0.5% or more, the making of this optical fiber is easy in this regard as well.<br>
Fig. 13 is a graph showing a dispersion characteristic of the optical fiber according to the first embodiment with respect to wavelength. As shown in this graph, the dispersion slope monotonously increases in a wavelength range of 1.30 μm to 1.55 μm. Also, Figs. 14 and 15 are graphs showing transmission loss characteristics with respect to wavelength of the optical fiber according to the first embodiment in cases where dehydration processing is insufficient and sufficient, respectively. As shown in these graphs, an increase in transmission loss caused by OH absorption is<br>
seen at a wavelength of 1.38 μm. In an optical fiber having such a transmission loss characteristic as that shown in Fig. 14, the dehydration processing is not sufficiently effected, so that the OH group content is large, whereby the amount of increase in transmission loss caused by OH absorption is about 0.5 dB/km. An optical fiber having such<br><br>
a transmission loss characteristics as that shown in Fig. 15, on the other hand, the dehydration processing is sufficiently effected so as to reduce the OH group content, whereby the increase in transmission loss caused by OH       absorption is suppressed to about 0.01 dB/km. When the above-mentioned wavelength band is utilized as a signal wavelength band, the zero-dispersion wavelength can be  set within a range of longer than 1.45 μm  but not longer than 1.55 μrn.    The same holds true for the respective dispersion<br>
       characteristics and transmission characteristics with<br>
respect to wavelength of the optical fibers according to the second to twelfth and fourteenth to twenty-second embodiments.<br>
Also, Fig. 16 is a graph showing a transmission loss<br>
        characteristic with respect to wavelength of the optical fiber according to the thirteenth embodiment in the case where the dehydration processing is insufficient, in the thirteenth embodiment, the increase in transmission loss caused by OH absorption (at a wavelength of 1.38 μm)  is 0.3<br>
        dB/km when the dehydration processing is not sufficiently effected. If the dehydration processing is sufficiently effected, however, then the increase in transmission loss<br>
at a wavelength of 1.3 μm (at a wavelength of 1.38 μm) can be suppressed to 0.01 dB/km or less, as shown in Fig. 14,        also in the case of the thirteenth embodiment.<br>
Without being restricted to the above-mentioned<br><br>
individual embodiments, the optical fiber according to the present invention can be modified in various manners; and, for example, other designs are possible within the scope of the present invention.<br>
Fig. 17A is a graph showing relationships between effective area Aeff and dispersion slope at a wavelength of<br>
1.55 μm mainly concerning the eighteenth to twenty-second embodiments. In this graph, P1, P5, P7, P9, P10, and P18 to P22 are points indicating the relationships between effective area Aeff and dispersion slope in the first, fifth, seventh, ninth, tenth, and eighteenth to twenty-second embodiments, respectively.<br>
As can also be seen from this graph, the dispersion<br>
slope at a wavelength of 1.55 μm can particularly be lowered in the case of optical fibers (eighteenth to twenty-second embodiments) having such a refractive index profile as that shown in Fig. 6. Also, the effective area Aeff at a wavelength of 1.55 μm in the optical fibers according to the eighteenth to twenty-second embodiments is greater than 49 μm2.<br>
Further, Fig. 17B is a graph showing relationships between cutoff wavelength Ac and bending loss per turn when bent at a diameter of 32 mm at a wavelength of 1.55 μm concerning main embodiments. In this graph, P1, P3, P4, P6, P7, P10, and P14 to P16 show the relationships between cutoff<br>
wavelength Ac and bending loss in the first, third, fourth, sixth, seventh, tenth, and fourteenth to sixteenth<br><br>
embodiments, respectively. Also, the hatched portion in this graph is an area in which points indicating relationships between cutoff wavelength A c and bending loss are intensively plotted with regard to conventional optical fibers having a refractive index profile similar to that shown in Fig. 6 . Therefore, for avoiding this area (hatched portion) , i.e., for yielding a bending loss of 1. 0 dB/turn or less, preferably 0.06 dB/turn or less at 32 mm at a wavelength of 1.55 μm, it is preferred that the cutoff wavelength Ac be 1.05 μm or more, more preferably 1.3 μm or more.<br>
Embodiments of the optical transmission system according to the present invention will now be explained. Fig. 18A is a view showing a schematic configuration of an embodiment of the optical transmission system according to the present invention. The optical transmission system shown in this drawing comprises transmitters 11, 12; optical transmission lines 21, 22; a multiplexer 30; an optical fiber 40; a demultiplexer 50; optical transmission lines 61, 62; and receivers 71, 72.<br>
The transmitter 11 outputs signal light (first signal light) in the 1.3-μm wavelength band; whereas the optical transmission line 21 is a transmission medium for guiding<br>
the signal light in the 1.3-μm wavelength band outputted from the transmitter 11 to the multiplexer 30 and, for example, is a standard single-mode optical fiber having a zero-dispersion wavelength in the 1.3-μm wavelength band.<br><br>
The transmitter 12 outputs signal light ( second signal light) in the 1.55-μm  wavelength band; whereas the optical transmission line 22 is a transmission medium for guiding<br>
the signal light in the 1.55-μm wavelength band outputted from the transmitter 12 to the multiplexer 30 and, for example, is a dispersion-shifted optical fiber having a<br>
zero-dispersion wavelength in the 1.55-μm wavelength band. The multiplexer 30 multiplexes the signal light in the<br>
1.3-μm wavelength band and signal light in the 1.55-μm wavelength band propagated through the optical transmission lines21, 22, and outputs thus multiplexed light to the optical fiber 40. The optical fiber 40 transmits the signal light in the 1.3-μm wavelength band and signal light in the 1.55-μm. wavelength band multiplexed by the multiplexer 30 toward the demultiplexer 50. The demultiplexer 50 demultiplexes<br>
the signal light in the 1.3-μm wavelength band and signal light in the 1. 55-μm wavelength band propagated through the optical fiber 40.<br>
The above-mentioned optical fiber 40 is an optical fiber according to the present invention having a configuration mentioned above, in which only one zero-dispersion wavelength exists within a wavelength range of 1.20 μm to 1.60 μm, whereas this zero-dispersion wavelength lies within a wavelength range of 1.37 μm to 1.50 μm (preferably within a wavelength range of 1.37/μm to l.43 μm or within a wavelength range of longer than 1.45 μm but not longer than 1.50 μm) .<br><br>
Also, in the optical fiber 40, the absolute value of dispersion slope at the zero-dispersion wavelength is 0.10 ps/nm2/km or less (preferably 0.06 ps/nm2/km or less at a wavelength<br>
of 1.55 μm.) . In a more preferred embodiment, the optical fiber 40 has a dispersion slope monotonously changing in<br>
a wavelength range of 1.30 μm to 1.55 μm, whereas each of the absolute values of dispersion at wavelengths of 1.3 μm and 1.55 μm is 12 ps/nm/km or less, the bending loss at a wavelength of 1.55 μm when wound at a diameter of 32 mm is 0.5 dB or less (preferably 0.06 dB or less) per turn, the effective area Aeff at the wavelength of 1.55 μm is 45 μm2 or more (greater than 49 μm2), or the increase in transmission loss caused by OH absorption at a wavelength of 1.38 μm is 0.1 dB/km or less.<br>
The optical transmission line 61 is a transmission medium for guiding the signal light in the 1.3-μ.m wavelength band demultiplexed by the demultiplexer 50 to the receiver 71 and, for example, is a standard single-mode optical fiber having a zero-dispersion wavelength in the 1.3-μm wavelength band. The receiver 71 receives the signal light in the 1.3-μm  wavelength band propagated through the optical transmission line 61. On the other hand, the optical transmission line 62 is a transmission medium for guiding the signal light in the 1.55-μm wavelength band demultiplexed by the demultiplexer 50 to the receiver 72 and, for example, is a dispersion-shifted optical fiber having a<br><br>
zero-dispersion wavelength in the 1. 55-μm wavelength band.<br>
The receiver 72 receives the signal light in the 1.55-μm<br>
wavelength band propagated through the optical transmission<br>
line 62.<br>
	In the optical transmission system according to this<br>
embodiment, the signal light in the 1.3-μm wavelength band having arrived at the multiplexer 30 by way of the optical transmission line 21 after being outputted from the transmitter 11, and the signal light in the 1.55-μm<br>
        wavelength band having arrived at the multiplexer 30 by way of the optical transmission line 22 after being outputted from the transmitter 12 are multiplexed by the multiplexer 30, and thus multiplexed light propagates through the optical fiber 40 and reaches the demultiplexer 50. The multiplexed<br>
        light having arrived at the demultiplexer 50 is demultiplexed thereby into the signal light in the 1.3-μm wavelength band and the signal light in the 1.55-μm wavelength band. The demultiplexed signal light in the 1.3-μm wavelength band reaches the receiver 71 by way of the optical transmission<br>
        line 61, whereas the signal light in the 1.55-μm wavelength band reaches the receiver 7 2 by way of the optical transmission line 62.<br>
Thus, the optical fiber 40 used in the optical transmission system of this embodiment comprises a structure<br>
        which realizes favorable optical communications in both of the 1.3-μm  wavelength band and 1.55-μm wavelength band,<br><br>
whereby the optical transmission system employing the optica 1 fiber 40 enables large-capacity communications.<br>
Without being restricted to the above-mentioned embodiment, the optical fiber according to the present invention can be modified in various manners. For example, the optical fiber, which is a transmission medium, disposed between the multiplexer 30 and demultiplexer 50 may be constituted by a plurality of optical fibers 40a to 40c as shown in Fig. 18B. Industrial Applicability<br>
According to the present invention, as explained in the foregoing, the optical fiber has only one zero-dispersion wavelength within a wavelength range of 1.37 JUm to 1.50 urn including a wavelength of 1.38 ΜM. at which an increase in transmission loss caused by OH absorption is seen, preferably within a wavelength range of 1.37 μm to 1.43 μ.m, or within a wavelength range of longer than 1.45 μm. but not longer than 1.50 μm, whereas no zero-dispersion wavelength exists in the vicinity of the 1.3-μm wavelength band and 1.55- μm wavelength band sandwiching these wavelength ranges. Therefore, when these wavelength bands are utilized as a signal light wavelength band, dispersion is intentionally generated, so as to effectively suppress nonlinear optical phenomena such as four-wave mixing. Also, since the absolute value of dispersion slope at thus set zero-dispersion wavelength is 0.10 ps/nm2/km or less (preferably 0.06<br><br>
