				<td>This is a window fan for windows with mosquitoes nets for the first time giving clean, cool, dust and germ free filtered air for dusty tropical towns. The ceiling, table, wall, exhaust fans do not give filtered cool air. It comprises of a fixing plate with screws, mounted above or onto side of windows. The fixing plate has a support rod with a pivot that has a motor mount. The motor mount is tilted in the pivot by handles and carries the electric motor with both ended double shaft rotating, the front fan blade assembly and an oscillator in the back. The fan blade assembly of desired shape and number rotates freely in a protective cage formed of front and back guards. The back guard is fixed to motor and on its back is a detachable dust germ air filter of plastic or metal net for easy cleaning. With speed and direction regulators, pivot tilt and oscillator a wide range of cool filtered air drawn from outside is circulated into the rooms for healthy never before air circulation. The window fan is the first useful fan for netted windows with dust and germ filter for clean healthy air.</td>

This Invention is a window fan providing dirt, dust free, cool, clean air without mosquitoes. There are no useful window fans in market offering these advantages. Existing Ceiling, table, pedestal fans circulate hot stable rooms air only without removal of dust; Exhaust and fresh air fans do not remove dust and cannot be spotted to a desired areal Dust carries germs, causes diseases and allergy; Dirt and dust free, cool clean air is not available in any fan till datel<br>
The window fan is easily to fit on any windows fitted with a detachable mosquito nets for the first time; The window fan pulls in cool outside air through the net free of insects removes dust and dirt, and circulates cool air in large quantities to a spot or wide area; The window shutterss are easy to open and close, also the insect netsl Window fan on cool side of the building (is,) west in early day, east in late day give coolest air all day;  There is no roof heat. Small rooms of flats, shop, offices, hospitals are better ventilated with dust free window fan in modern dusty polluted netesl<br>
The invention is described with reference to the accompanying diagrams wherein;<br>
Pig 1 Shows the window fan on a window<br>
Pig 2 Shows the parts<br>
Pig 3 Shows a modification with side fixing.<br><br>
The fan comprises of a fixing base plate (1) with two or more fixing screws (2) to fix above the window. The base plate has a down rod (3) which has a curve in the lower part (for fan blade cage oscillation) and ends in a pivot (4) which supports a motor fixing mount (5) on screwable handles (6) for tilting and fixing the motor mount easily.<br>
An electric motor (7) with a fan blade assembly (8) on the front projecting end of the motor drive shaft and an oscillator (9) on the back projecting end of drive shaft is mounted on the motor fixing mount. The oscillator has a button (10) to engage or release the oscillator on the back of motor drive shaft! The oscillator mechanism is well known, and comprises of a gear activated by the button 10 on the drive shaft and rotates a wheel with a push rod, attached to the motor fixing mount oscillating the fan bladecage.<br>
The metal or plastic fan blade assembly of the required air pushing volume is fixed at the motor drive shaft front by a bolt on a screw or such mechanism.. The number and shape of blades will vary for desired air volume circulation. The motor maybe provided with one or two way rotating circuit.<br>
The blade is enclosed in a protective cage with a front (11) and a back guard (12) fixed to the motor. The back guard is fixed to the motor, after the fan blade assembly is fixed to drive shaft front; the front guard is fixed on the back guard detachably for easy removal and cleaning of the fan blades. On the back of the back guard is a detachable filter13 for dust and dirt removal. The filter in the simplest form comprises of a dust, dirt, germ trapping washable fabric or plastic or metal mesh, with chosen pores and  mounted in a frame which is simply clipped on to the back of the blackguard. For low power fans, the filter is attached to a frame that simply sits on the back of the back guard forming a close contact low resistance air-cleaning surface. For high power fans, the filter may have two or more layers of fabric in a suitable frame, if needed for more air filtration. Filter may be made as two or more parts, say an upper and lower parts clamped to back guard for easy removal and cleaning. The filter is cleaned as needed for removal of collected dirt and for releasing the filter pores. The motor is provided with speed and direction switch regulators (14) with necessary cable and plug (15) with afe<br><br>
earthing. The motor is enclosed in a decorative cover (16) with holes for airflow and cooling of the motor in use.<br>
Air ioniser (19) is fixed to front of fan guard. It creates negative ions that cleans air that is blown, the ionisers comprise of negative ions generator, enclosed in a frame connected by wires that is concealed inside the fan cage and connected to fan motor main wire or separate switch may be used.<br>
The window fan is fixed around the window by screwing the base plate. The down rod with motor is a little  in fi'ont of the mosquito net. The pivot handle (6) is adjusted for needed tilt of fan blades. The oscillator buttonlO is pressed if needed. Cable is plugged, needed speed and direction is set.<br>
The fan blades suck in fresh, cool, outside air through the insect net. The filter 13 traps the dust, germs and fresh cool air is blown into the room. The pivot and oscillator give large range of air movement for comfort. Window fans on the shade of building (i.e., west in morning, east in evening) gives cool air, with a never before clean filtered healthy air. The shutters of window and insect nets are easily used as the window fan is a little in front and independent of these.<br>
The fan can be modified! Base plate may be provided with a quared hook (18). The down rod is provided with a matching squared adaptor to fit on the hook firmly. The hook and adaptor offers easy removal and fixing on inside room closing shutter windows. With more hooks, a few fans can be used for all rooms as needd.<br>
The base plate can be mounted above or on the window frame with vibration free mounting. The pivot may be modified. The pivot can be above the motor with the motor fixing mount hanging down! The motor may be uni or bidirectional for forward or exhaust flow of air. The oscillator may be deleted. The front cage may have a separate smaller motor for oscillating the louvers. The filter is placed behind the blade cage for easy cleaning. The filter can be a half circle, upper and lower halves for easy dealing. The air ionisers may be mounted between the filter and the fan blade or before the blade. The control can have controls for motor, ionisers, and front louver motor if used.<br><br>
The cage may be in any elegant form. A cover for motor allows airflow and cooling of motor in use. The oscillator handle can be modified.<br>
The above embodiment allows for a goodlooking central mount of fan. The base fixing plate may be fixed on the side of window (fig 3) with regulators (14), night lamps, covering the fixing plat. An adjustable (17) side rod with pivot and motor is used. The base fixing plate may be covered with a plastic cover with night bulbs for good looks. The fan can be decorated in colours, finish and attachments<br>
For large windows, two window fans may beused. For industrial sheds, the motor with a blower is fixed in a frame suspended on fixing plate. The detachable filter is on the back, the louver is on the front and swung by another small motor to spread air.<br>
The device offers never before dust free, filtered, cool clean air with safety, easy cleaning and use in dusty towns<br>
Advantages:<br>
1.	Filter traps and gives dust, germ free air in polluted towns.<br>
2.	Window air is cool and  cooling of room is faster and healthy.<br>
3.	Oscillator and pivot give a wide range ofair throw, cooling room fast.<br>
4.	Filter is detachable for easy cleaning and refixing.<br>
5.	Adds decor to room by fixing around the window, with night bulbs.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
