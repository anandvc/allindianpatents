PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br><br>
7 NOV 2006<br>
The   following   specification  particularly   describes   the inventionjand the  manner  in which  it   is     to be  performed   :   -<br><br>
An improved air conditioner with dehumidifier<br>
Field of the Invention:<br>
This invention relates to an improved air conditioner more particularly this invention relates to an air conditioner incorporating a dehumidifier and a system which allows treated fresh air to enter into the room.<br>
Prior Art:<br>
The existing air conditioners have a single compressor that is used for cooling the room has the following defects:<br>
1.	No dehumidification when the compressor is off therefore the humidity increases because of infiltration of outside moisture, particularly during the monsoon.<br>
2.	Capacity of the air conditioner is determined by the peak load of the room which is in the afternoon, while at night the load of the same room is very low because of this compressor remains off for the longer time during which outside moisture enters the room and causes humid condition which may give rise to condensation and fungus growth, which is extremely unhealthy.<br>
3.	To counter this the compressor is forced to run all the time with added artificial load, using electric heaters. This is a huge waste of electric energy.<br>
4.	They do not have any provision for injecting an appropriate amount of treated and dehumidified fresh air into the room. On the contrary, they have a vent that exhausts some cold air to the outside forcing untreated air to enter in the room, usually through the door gaps.<br><br>
Hence there is a need of an improved air conditioning system which will provide the<br>
dehumidification of the place in which it is located.<br>
Object of the Invention:<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide an improved air conditioning system<br>
which will obviate all the deficiencies associated with the prior art air conditioning<br>
system.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide an air conditioner that allows a continuous dehumidification and treated fresh air so that the atmosphere in the room is healthy without any fungus or condensation.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide an air conditioner with dehumidifier which saves the energy and cost.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide an air conditioner which eliminates the danger of fire from an overheated electric heating element in case the air flow either reduces or stops.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide an air conditioner with dehumidifier which provides a healthy, fresh and comfortable indoor environment at all times by providing continuous dehumidification at greatly reduced energy cost.<br>
Statement of the Invention:<br>
Accordingly to achieve the aforementioned objects, there is provided an improved air conditioner with dehumidifier comprises:<br>
a pair of refrigeration circuit, each said refrigeration circuit consists of a compressor, one compressor is having a small capacity than the other compressor,<br><br>
an evaporator section consisting of an evaporator coil for carrying refrigerant from the compressors, said evaporator coil is divided into two parts in which one is carrying the refrigerant from compressor of first refrigerant circuit and other from the compressor of second refrigerant circuit;<br>
a condenser with fan being connected to said evaporator section for providing dehumidification of air, said condenser is provided with a tube drawing fresh air from condenser to evaporator coil for dehumidification;<br>
an additional coil for providing reheat to the dehumidified air, said coil is connected to the output of hot gas from compressor thereby reheating the cold air by hot gas generated by compressor.<br>
The small capacity compressor works continuously for cooling and dehumidification while large capacity compressor works only when load on small capacity compressor is excess of the capacity of the small capacity compressor.<br>
Brief Description of the Drawings:<br>
Figure 1	Shows the perspective view of the air conditioner with dehumidifier in<br>
accordance to present invention.<br>
Figure 2    :    Shows the perspective view of the main refrigeration circuit.<br>
Figure 3	Shows the perspective view of the dehumidifier circuit   showing the<br>
hot gas reheat coil.<br>
Figure 4	Shows another view of the air conditioner with dehumidifier in<br>
accordance to present invention.<br>
Detailed Description of the invention:<br>
The invention will now be described with reference to figures 1 to 4 in the accompanying drawings.<br><br>
Referring to Figures 1 to 4, an air conditioner with dehumidifier mainly consists of two refrigeration circuits, evaporator section, condenser and additional coil. The air conditioner (1) having two refrigeration circuits each having its own compressor (2, 3). In these compressors one (3) is having small capacity than the other compressor (2). The small compressor (3) runs all the time for cooling and dehumidification while the large compressor (2) works only when the load is in excess of the capacity of small compressor (3). The large compressor (2) will cut off as soon as the desired temperature is achieved while the small compressor (3) will continuous running. Since the capacity of the small compressor (3) is not sufficient to meet the base load, the large compressor (2) will keep cutting in and out to fill in the gap.<br>
The evaporator section consists of an evaporator coil (4, 5). The evaporator coil is divided into two sections (4, 5). Section (4) carries the refrigerant from compressor (2) while (5) carries the refrigerant from compressor (3) thereby cooling the air returning from the room shown by arrow (1) and sending the cool air into the room through the arrow (2) with help of centrifugal fan (11) on the way out the air brushes pass the re¬heating coil (6) which will be activated if the room temperature is below a set point.<br>
A condenser (9) with fan (13) is connected to evaporator section for providing dehumidification of air. Also condenser (9) is provided with a tube (8) drawing fresh air from condenser to evaporator coil (4, 5) for dehumidification. The condenser (9) is divided into two parts (9A, 9B). Section (9A) carries hot gas from compressor (2) and section (9B) carries hot gas from compressor (3). These gases condensed by the air blown over them by condenser fan (9). Both the liquids returned to their corresponding inlets on the cooling coil (4, 5) thus completing the circuits. The fresh Air is flows under pressure from plenum (7) via tube (8) into the evaporator coil (4, 5) thereby de-humidifying and mix with the main air steam before entering in the room.<br><br>
An additional coil (6) is provided for reheat to the dehumidified air. This coil (6) is connected to the output of hot gas from compressor thereby reheating the cold air by hot gas generated by compressor.<br>
According to another embodiment of the present invention the condenser (9) and evaporator sections may be placed at different locations wherein condenser may be kept outside the room and evaporator section is kept inside the room. Both condenser and evaporator section are connected to each other by two independent refrigerant circuits, electrical wiring and an extended fresh air pipe.<br>
This is an embodiment of the invention. Several modifications are possible may be considered within the ambit and spirit of this invention. Since many modifications, variations and changes in detail may be made to the above described embodiments, it is intended that all matters described in the foregoing description as described in the accompanying specification.<br><br>
Claim:<br>
1.	An improved air conditioner with dehumidifier (1) comprises:<br>
a pair of refrigeration circuit, each said refrigeration circuit consists of a<br>
compressor (2, 3), one compressor is having a small capacity than the other<br>
