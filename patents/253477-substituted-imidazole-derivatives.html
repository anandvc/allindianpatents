N-(1-(1-BENZYL  -4-PHENYL-1H-IMIDAZOL-2-YL)-2,2-DIMETHYLPROPYL)BENZAMIDE DERIVAIVES AND RELATED  COMPOUNDS AS   KINESIN  SPINDLE  BROTBIN   (KSP)   INHIBITORS FOR  THE TREATMENT OF  CANCER<br>
[0001]   This application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. ยง119(e) of U.S. Provisional Application Serial No. 60/580,927 filed June 18, 2004, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention [0002]<br>
   The present invention relates to substituted imidazole compounds and<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts, esters or prodrugs thereof, compositions of these compounds together with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, and uses of these compounds.<br>
State of the Art<br>
[0003]   Kinesins are motor proteins that use adenosine triphosphate to bind to microtubules and generate mechanical force. Kinesins are characterized by a motor domain having about 350 amino acid residues. The crystal structures of several kinesin motor domains have been resolved.<br>
[0004]    Currently, about one hundred kinesin-related proteins (KRP) have been identified. Kinesins are involved in a variety of cell biological processes including transport of organelles and vesicles, and maintenance of the endoplasmic reticulum. Several KRPs interact with the microtubules of the mitotic spindle or with the chromosomes directly and appear to play a pivotal role during the mitotic stages of the cell cycle. These mitotic KRPs are of particular interest for the development of cancer therapeutics.<br><br>
WO 2006/002236	PCT/US2005/022062<br>
[0005] Kinesin spindle protein (KSP) (also known as Eg5, HsEg5, KNSL1, or KIF11) is one of several kinesin-like motor proteins that are localized to the mitotic spindle and known to be required for formation and/or function of the bipolar mitotic spindle.<br>
[0006]   In 1995, the depletion of KSP using an antibody directed against the C-terminus of KSP was shown to arrest HeLa cells in mitosis with monoastral microtubule arrays (Blangy et al., Cell 55:1159-1169,1995). Mutations in bimC and cut7 genes, which are considered to be homologues of KSP, cause failure in centrosome separation in Aspergillus nidulans (Enos, A.P., andN.R. Morris, Cell 50:1019-1027,1990) and Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Hagan, I., and M. Yanagida, Nature 347:563-566,1990). Treatment of cells with either ATRA (all trans-retinoic acid), which reduces KSP expression on the protein level, or depletion of KSP using antisense oligonucleotides revealed a significant growth inhibition in DAN-G pancreatic carcinoma cells indicating that KSP might be involved in the antiproliferative action of all trans-retinoic acid (Kaiser, A., et al., J. Biol. Chem. 274,18925-18931,1999). Interestingly, iheXenopus laevis Aurora-related protein kinase pEg2 was shown to associate and phosphorylate XlEg5 (Giet, R., et al., J. Biol. Chem. 274:15005-15013,1999). Potential substrates of  wrora-related kinases are of particular interest for cancer drug development. For example, Aurora 1 and 2 kinases are overexpressed on the protein and RNA level and the genes are amplified in colon cancer patients.<br>
[0007]   The first cell permeable small molecule inhibitor for KSP, "monastrol," was shown to arrest cells with monopolar spindles without affecting microtubule polymerization as do conventional chemotherapeutics such as taxanes and vinca alkaloids (Mayer, T.U., et al., Science 286:971-974,1999). Monastrol was identified as an inhibitor in phenotype-based<br>
2<br><br>
WO 2006/002236	PCT/US2005/022062<br>
screens and it was suggested that this compound may serve as a lead for the development of anticancer drugs. The inhibition was determined not to be competitive in respect to adenosine triphosphate and to be rapidly reversible (DeBonis, S., et al., Biochemistry ยฅ2:338-349,2003; Kapoor, T.M., et al., J. CellBiol. 750:975-988,2000).<br>
[0008]    In light of the importance of improved chemotherapeutics, there is a need for KSP inhibitors that are effective in vivo inhibitors of KSP and KSP-related proteins.<br>

[0128]   It is understood that in all substituted groups defined above, polymers arrived at by defining substituents with further substituents to themselves (e.g., substituted aryl having a substituted aryl group as a substituent which is itself substituted with a substituted aryl group, etc.) are not intended for inclusion herein. In such cases, the maximum number of such substituents is three. That is to say that each of the above definitions is constrained by a limitation that, for example, substituted aryl groups are limited to -substituted aryl-(substituted aryl)-substituted aryl.<br>
[0129]   Similarly, it is understood that the above definitions are not intended to include impermissible substitution patterns (e.g., methyl substituted with 5 fluoro groups or a hydroxyl group alpha,to ethenylic or acetylenic unsaturation). Such impermissible substitution patterns are well known to the skilled artisan.<br>

[0130]   Compounds of this invention may exhibit stereoisomerism by virtue of the presence of one or more asymmetric or chiral centers in the compounds. The present invention contemplates the various stereoisomers and mixtures thereof. Certain of the compounds of the invention comprise asymmetrically substituted carbon atoms. Such asymmetrically substituted carbon atoms can result in the compounds of the invention comprising mixtures of stereoisomers at a particular asymmetrically substituted carbon atom or a single stereoisomer. As a result, racemic mixtures, mixtures of diastereomers, single enantiomer, as well as single diastereomers of the compounds of the invention are included in the present invention. The terms "S" and "R" configuration, as used herein, are as defined by the IUPAC 1974 "RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SECTION E, FUNDAMENTAL STEREOCHEMISTRY," Pure Appl. Chem. 45:13-30,1976. Desired enantiomers can be obtained by chiral synthesis from commercially available chiral starting materials by methods well known in the art, or may be obtained from mixtures of the enantiomers by separating the desired enantiomer by using known techniques.<br>
[0131]   Compounds of this invention may also exhibit geometrical isomerism. Geometrical isomers include the cis and trans forms of compounds of the invention having alkenyl or alkenylenyl moieties. The present invention comprises the individual geometrical isomers and stereoisomers and mixtures thereof.<br>
B.       Compound Preparation<br>
[0132]    The compounds of this invention can be prepared from readily available starting materials using the following general methods and procedures. Unless otherwise indicated, the starting materials are commercially available and well known in the art. It will be<br>
61<br><br>
WO 2006/002236	PCT/US2005/022062<br>
appreciated that where typical or preferred process conditions (i.e., reaction temperatures, times, mole ratios of reactants, solvents, pressures) are given, other process conditions can also be used unless otherwise stated. Optimum reaction conditions may vary with the particular reactants or solvent used, but such conditions can be determined by one skilled in the art by routine optimization procedures.<br>
[0133]   Additionally, as will be apparent to those skilled in the art, conventional protecting groups may be necessary to prevent certain functional groups from undergoing undesired reactions. Suitable protecting groups for various functional groups as well as suitable conditions for protecting and deprotecting particular functional groups are well known in the art. For example, numerous protecting groups are described in T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis, Second Edition, Wiley, New York, 1991, and references cited therein.<br>
[0134]    Furthermore, the compounds of this invention may contain one or more chiral centers. Accordingly, if desired, such compounds can be prepared or isolated as pure stereoisomers, i.e., as individual enantiomers or diastereomers, or as stereoisomer-enriched mixtures. All such stereoisomers (and enriched mixtures) are included within the scope of this invention, unless otherwise indicated. Pure stereoisomers (or enriched mixtures) may be prepared using, for example, optically active starting materials or stereoselective reagents well-known in the art. Alternatively, racemic mixtures of such compounds can be separated using, for example, chiral column chromatography, chiral resolving agents, and the like.<br>
[0135]    Compounds in the present invention may be better understood by the following synthetic Scheme that illustrate methods for the synthesis of compounds of the<br>
68<br><br>
WO 2006/002236	PCT/US2005/022062<br>
invention. Unless otherwise indicated, the reagents used in the following examples are commercially available and may be purchased from vendors such as Sigma-Aldrich Company, Inc. (Milwaukee, WI, USA).<br>
[0136]   Arylimidazole compounds may be synthesized by Scheme 1 below:<br><br>
R1, Ar, A23 and A are as defined herein. -CH2-R4 is R4, where R4 is as defined herein. PG refers to a protecting group, such as BOC. PG' refers to a protecting group, such as phthalimide. X refers to a halide, such as bromo.<br>
69<br><br>
WO 2006/002236	PCT/US2005/022062<br>
[0137]    Specifically, in Scheme 1, an appropriately protected (PG) amino acid<br>
1000,	is dissolved in a suitable amount of an inert solvent, such as methanol or ethanol. It should<br>
be noted amino acid 1000 is typically commercially available as are a,a-disubstituted amino<br>
acids (PG-NH-C(R1)(R2)-COOH). To that is added about a stoichiometric amount of a<br>
monovalent cation, such as cesium carbonate (CS2CO3), to form the carboxylate salt (not shown).<br>
Upon substantial completion of the reaction, typically about 15 minutes to about 2 hours, excess<br>
solvent is removed under reduced pressure. The remaining salt is then re-dissolved in a suitable<br>
solvent, such as DMF, and then treated with 1 to 4 equivalents of the appropriate a-halo ketone<br>
1001,	for example 2-bromoacetophenone and then stirred at room temperature until the reaction<br>
is substantially complete.<br>
[0138]   The resulting P-ketoester 1002 can be recovered and optionally purified by conventional methods, such as precipitation, filtration, evaporation, crystallization and the like. Alternatively, ?-ketoester 1002 can be used directly in the next step without purification or isolation.<br>
[0139]   Next, to a stirred solution of ?-ketoester 1002 in a suitable inert solvent, such as toluene, xylenes, and the like is added an excess of ammonium acetate, typically from about 2 to about 20 equivalents and preferably about 5 equivalents. In one embodiment, a Dean-Stark trap is added and the resulting mixture is heated at elevated temperatures of from about 120 to about 160ยฐC until the reaction is complete. Once complete, the mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature. The resulting arylimidazole 1003 is then recovered and optionally purified by conventional methods such as precipitation, filtration, evaporation, crystallization,<br>
70<br><br>
WO 2006/002236	PCT/US2005/022062<br>
chromatography and the like. Alternatively, arylimidazole 1003 may be used in the,next step without purification and/or isolation.<br>
[0140]   The arylimidazole 1003 is then reacted with an appropriate aryl or heteroaryl-substituted alkyl halide, such as benzyl bromide. Typically, this can be accomplished by stirring the arylimidazole 1003 with an excess of potassium carbonate and DMF and then adding at least an equimolar amount of the aryl or heteroaryl-substituted alkyl halide.<br>
[0141]   Compounds of the invention when R5 is L-A1 and L is -S(O)q-, may be synthesized using a suitable sulfonyl chloride. Descriptions of various suflonyl chlorides may be found, for example, in U.S. Patent 6,489,300, which is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
[0142]   The protecting group, PG is then removed by conventional techniques to provide amine 1004, which is then optionally purified by conventional means such as precipitation, filtration, evaporation, crystallization, chromatography and the like. Alternatively, amine 1004 can be.used directly in the next step without purification and/or isolation.<br>
[0143]   Amine 1004 is reacted under conventional reductive amination conditions with aldehyde 1005 to provide for substituted amine 1006 which is then recovered and optionally purified by conventional methods such as precipitation, filtration, evaporation, crystallization, chromatography and the like. Alternatively, substituted amine 1006 can be used directly in the next step without purification and/or isolation.<br>
[0144]   Substituted amine 1006 is then reacted under conventional amidation conditions with acyl chloride 1007. Any protecting groups, such as PG', remaining on the resulting amide product, 1008, can be removed by conventional methods and the product can be<br>
71<br><br>
WO 2006/002236	PCT/US2005/022062<br>
recovered and purified by conventional methods such as precipitation, filtration, evaporation, crystallization, chromatography and the like.<br>
[0145]    It will be well within the skill of the art to further modify the above preparation to synthesize other compounds of this invention.<br>
C.       Pharmaceutical Formulations<br>
[0146]   When employed as Pharmaceuticals, the compounds of the subject invention are usually administered in the form of pharmaceutical compositions. These compositions can be administered by a variety of routes including oral, parenteral, transdermal, topical, rectal, and intranasal. These compounds are effective, for example, as both injectable and oral compositions. Such compositions are prepared in a manner well known in the pharmaceutical art and comprise at least one active compound.<br>
[0147]   This invention also includes pharmaceutical compositions which contain, as the active ingredient, one or more of the compounds of the subject invention above associated with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. In making the compositions of this invention, the active ingredient is usually mixed with an excipient, diluted by an excipient or enclosed within such a carrier which can be in the form of a capsule, sachet, paper or other container. The excipient employed is typically an excipient suitable for administration to human subjects or other mammals. When the excipient serves as a diluent, it can be a solid, semi-solid, or liquid material, which acts as a vehicle, carrier or medium for the active ingredient. Thus, the compositions can be in the form of tablets, pills, powders, lozenges, sachets, cachets, elixirs, suspensions, emulsions, solutions, syrups, aerosols (as a solid or in a liquid medium), ointments<br>
72<br><br>
WO 2006/002236	PC17US2005/022062<br>
containing, for example,* up to 10% by weight of the active compound, soft and hard gelatin capsules, suppositories, sterile injectable solutions, and sterile packaged powders.<br>
[0148]   In preparing a formulation, it may be necessary to null the active compound to provide the appropriate particle size prior to combining with the other ingredients. If the active compound is substantially insoluble, it ordinarily is milled to a particle size of less than 200 mesh. If the active compound is substantially water soluble, the particle size is normally adjusted by milling to provide a substantially uniform distribution in the formulation, e.g., about 40 mesh.<br>
[0149]    Some examples of suitable excipients include lactose, dextrose, sucrose, sorbitol, mannitol, starches, gum acacia, calcium phosphate, alginates, tragacanth, gelatin, calcium silicate, microcrystalline cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, cellulose, sterile water, syrup, and methyl cellulose. The formulations can additionally include: lubricating agents such as talc, magnesium stearate, and mineral oil; wetting agents; emulsifying and suspending agents; preserving agents such as methyl- and propylhydroxy-benzoates; sweetening agents; and flavoring agents. The compositions of the invention can be formulated so as to provide quick, sustained or delayed release of the active ingredient after administration to the patient by employing procedures known in the art.<br>
[0150]   The quantity of active component, that is the compound according to the subject invention, in the pharmaceutical composition and unit dosage form thereof may be varied or adjusted widely depending upon the particular application, the potency of the particular compound and the desired concentration.<br>
73<br><br>
WO 2006/002236	PCT/US2005/022062<br>
[0151]    The compositions are preferably formulated in a unit dosage form, each dosage containing from about 1 to about 500 mg, usually about 5 to about 100 mg,.occasionally about 10 to about 30 mg, of the active ingredient. The term "unit dosage forms" refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages for human subjects and other mammals, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect, in association with a suitable pharmaceutical excipient. Preferably, the compound of the subject invention above is employed at no more than about 20 weight percent of the pharmaceutical composition, more preferably no more than about 15 weight percent, with the balance being pharmaceutically inert carrier(s).<br>
[0152]   The active compound is effective over a wide dosage range and is generally administered in a pharmaceutically or therapeutically effective amount. It will be understood, however, that the amount of the compound actually administered will be determined by a physician, in the light of the relevant circumstances, including the condition to be treated, the severity of the condition being treated, the chosen route of administration, the actual compound administered, the age, weight, and response of the individual patient, the severity of the patient's symptoms, and the like.<br>
[0153]   In therapeutic use for treating, or combating, cancer in mammals, the compounds or pharmaceutical compositions thereof will be administered by any appropriate route, such as orally, topically, transdermally, and/or parenterally at a dosage to obtain and maintain a concentration, that is, an amount, or blood-level of active component in the mammal undergoing treatment that will be therapeutically effective. Generally, such therapeutically<br>
74<br><br>
WO 2006/002236	PCT/US2005/022062<br>
effective amount of dosage of active component (i.e., an effective dosage) will be in the range of about 0.1 to about 100, more preferably about 1.0 to about 50 mg/kg of body weight/day.<br>
[0154]   For preparing solid compositions such as tablets, the principal active ingredient is mixed with a pharmaceutical excipient to form a solid prefbrmulation composition containing a homogeneous mixture of a compound of the present invention. When referring to these preformulation compositions as homogeneous, it is meant that the active ingredient is dispersed evenly throughout the composition so that the composition may be readily subdivided into equally effective unit dosage forms such as tablets, pills and capsules. This solid preformulation is then subdivided into unit dosage forms of the type described above containing from, for example, 0.1 to about 500 mg of the active ingredient of the present invention.<br>
[0155]    The tablets or pills of the present invention may be coated or otherwise compounded to provide a dosage form affording the advantage of prolonged action. For example, the tablet or pill can comprise an inner dosage and an outer dosage component, the latter being in the form of an envelope over the former. The two components can be separated by an enteric layer which serves to resist disintegration in the stomach and permit the inner component to pass intact into the duodenum or to be delayed in release. A variety of materials can be used for such enteric layers or coatings, such materials including a number of polymeric acids and mixtures of polymeric acids with such materials as shellac, cetyl alcohol, and cellulose acetate.<br>
[0156]   The liquid forms in which the novel compositions of the present invention may be incorporated for administration orally or by injection include aqueous solutions, suitably flavored syrups, aqueous or oil suspensions, and flavored emulsions with<br>

WO 2006/002236	PCT/US2005/022062<br>
edible oils such as corn oil, cottonseed oil, sesame oil, coconut oil, or peanut oil, as well as elixirs and similar pharmaceutical vehicles.<br>
[0157]    Compositions for inhalation or insufflation include solutions and suspensions in pharmaceutically acceptable, aqueous or organic solvents, or mixtures thereof, and powders. The liquid or solid compositions may contain suitable pharmaceutically acceptable excipients as described supra. Preferably the compositions are administered by the oral or nasal respiratory route for local or systemic effect. Compositions in preferably pharmaceutically acceptable solvents may be nebulized by use of inert gases. Nebulized solutions may be inhaled directly from the nebulizing device or the nebulizing device may be attached to a face mask tent, or intermittent positive pressure breathing machine. Solution, suspension, or powder compositions may be administered, preferably orally or nasally, from devices which deliver the formulation in an appropriate manner.<br>

[0178]    Another preferred formulation employed in the methods of the present invention employs transdermal delivery devices ("patches"). Such transdermal patches may be used to provide continuous or discontinuous infusion of the compounds of the present invention in controlled amounts. The construction and use of transdermal patches for the delivery of pharmaceutical agents is well known in the art. See, e.g., U.S. Patent 5,023,252, issued June 11, 1991, herein incorporated by reference. Such patches may be constructed for continuous, pulsatile, or on demand delivery of pharmaceutical agents.<br>
[0179]   Frequently, it will be desirable or necessary to introduce the<br>
pharmaceutical composition to the brain, either directly or indirectly. Direct techniques usually involve placement of a drug delivery catheter into the host's ventricular system to bypass the blood-brain barrier. One such implantable delivery system used for the transport of biological factors to specific anatomical regions of the body is described in U.S. Patent 5,011,472 which is herein incorporated by reference.<br>
[01S0]   Indirect techniques, which are generally preferred, usually involve formulating the compositions to provide for drug latentiation by the conversion of hydrophilic<br>
81<br><br>
WO 2006/002236	PCT/US2005/022062<br>
drugs into lipid-soluble drugs. Latentiation is generally achieved through blocking of the hydroxy, carbonyl, sulfate, and primary amine groups present on the drug to render the drug more lipid soluble and amenable to transportation across the blood-brain barrier. Alternatively, the delivery of hydropbilic drugs may be enhanced by intra-arterial infusion of hypertonic solutions which can transiently open the blood-brain barrier.<br>

D.       Dosage and Administration<br>
[0182]   As noted above, the compounds described herein are suitable for use in a variety of drug delivery systems described above. Additionally, in order to enhance the in vivo serum half-life of the administered compound, the compounds may be encapsulated, introduced into the lumen of liposomes, prepared as a colloid, or other conventional techniques may be employed which provide an extended serum half-life of the compounds. A variety of methods are available for preparing liposomes, as described in, e.g., Szoka, et al., U.S. Patent Nos. 4,235,871,4,501,728 and 4,837,028 each of which is incorporated herein by reference,<br>
[0183]   Compounds of the instant invention are useful for inhibiting or treating a disorder mediated, at least in part, by the activity of KSP. In one aspect, the disorder that is mediated, at least in part by KSP, is a cellular proliferative disorder. The term "cellular proliferative disorder" or "cell proliferative disorder" refers to diseases including, for example, cancer, tumor, hyperplasia, restenosis, cardiac hypertrophy, immune disorder and inflammation. The present invention provides methods of treating a human or mammalian subject in need of<br>
82<br><br>
WO 2006/002236	PCT/US2005/022062<br>
such treatment, comprising administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formulae I-VII, either alone or in combination with other anticancer agents.<br>
[0184]   The compounds of the invention are useful in vitro or in vivo in inhibiting the growth of cancer cells. The term "cancer" refers to cancer diseases including, for example, lung and bronchus; prostate; breast; pancreas; colon and rectum; thyroid; stomach; liver and intrahepatic bile duct; kidney and renal pelvis; urinary bladder; uterine corpus; uterine cervix; ovary; multiple myeloma; esophagus; acute myelogenous leukemia; chronic myelognous leukemia; lymphocytic leukemia; myeloid leukemia; brain; oral cavity and pharynx; larynx; small intestine; non-hodgkin lymphoma; melanoma; and villous colon adenoma.<br>
[0185]    Cancer also includes tumors or neoplasms selected from the group consisting of carcinomas, adenocarcinomas, sarcomas, and hematological malignancies.<br>
[0186]    Additionally, the type of cancer can be selected from the group consisting of growth of solid tumors/malignancies, myxoid and round cell carcinoma, locally advanced tumors, human soft tissue carcinoma, cancer metastases, squamous cell carcinoma, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, oral carcinoma, cutaneous T cell lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, cancer of the adrenal cortex, ACTH-producing tumors, nonsmall cell cancers, breast cancer, gastrointestinal cancers, urological cancers, malignancies of the female genital tract, malignancies of the male genital tract, kidney cancer, brain cancer, bone cancers, skin cancers, thyroid cancer, retinoblastoma, neuroblastoma, peritoneal effusion, malignant pleural effusion, mesothelioma, Wilms's tumors, gall bladder cancer, trophoblastic neoplasms, hemangiopericytoma, and Kaposi's sarcoma.<br>

[0187]   A compound or composition of this invention may be administered to the mammal by a suitable route, such as orally, intravenously, parenterally, transdermally, topically, rectally, or intranasally.<br>
[01S8]   Mammals include, for example, humans and other primates, pet or companion animals, such as dogs and cats, laboratory animals, such as rats, mice and rabbits, and farm animals, such as horses, pigs, sheep, and cattle.<br>
[0189]   Tumors or neoplasms include growths of tissue cells in which the multiplication of the cells is uncontrolled and progressive. Some such growths are benign, but others are termed "malignant" and can lead to death of the organism. Malignant neoplasms or "cancers" are distinguished from benign growths in that, in addition to exhibiting aggressive cellular proliferation, they can invade surrounding tissues and metastasize. Moreover, malignant neoplasms are characterized in that they show a greater loss of differentiation (greater "dedifferentiation") and organization relative to one another and to surrounding tissues. This property is called "anaplasia."<br>
[0190]   Compounds having the desired biological activity may be modified as necessary to provide desired properties such as improved pharmacological properties {e.g., in vivo stability, bio-availability), or the ability to be detected in diagnostic applications. Stability can be assayed in a variety of ways such as by measuring the half-life of the compounds during incubation with peptidases or human plasma or serum.<br>
[0191]   For diagnostic purposes, a wide variety of labels may be linked to the, compounds, which may provide, directly or indirectly, a detectable signal. Thus, the compounds and/or compositions of the subject invention may be modified in a variety of ways for a variety<br>
84<br><br>
WO 2006/002236	PCT/US2005/022062<br>
of end purposes while still retaining biological activity. In addition, various reactive sites may be introduced for linking to particles, solid substrates, macromolecules, and the like.<br>
[0192]   Labeled compounds can be used in a variety of in vivo or in vitro applications. A wide variety of labels may be employed, such as radionuclides (e.g., gamma-emitting radioisotopes such as technetium-99 or indium-111), fluorescers (e.g., fluorescein), enzymes, enzyme substrates, enzyme cofactors, enzyme inhibitors, chemiluminescent compounds, bioluminescent compounds, and the like. Those of ordinary skill in the art will know of other suitable labels for binding to the complexes, or will be able to ascertain such using routine experimentation. The binding of these labels is achieved using standard techniques common to those of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
[0193J   Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention are suitable for use in a variety of drug delivery systems. Suitable formulations for use in the present invention are found in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mace Publishing Company, Philadelphia, Pa., 17th ed. (1985).<br>
[0194]   The amount administered to the patient will vary depending upon what is being administered, the purpose of the administration, such as prophylaxis or therapy, the state of the patient, the manner of administration, and the like. In therapeutic applications, compositions are administered to a patient already suffering from a disease in an amount sufficient to cure or at least partially arrest the progression or symptoms of the disease and its complications. An amount adequate to accomplish this is defined as "therapeutically effective dose." Amounts effective for this use will depend on the disease condition being treated as well as by the<br>
85<br><br>
WO 2006/002236	PCT/US2005/022062<br>
judgment of the attending clinician depending upon factors such as the severity of the disease, disorder or condition, the age, weight and general condition of the patient, and the like.<br>
[0195]   The compounds administered to a patient are typically in the form of pharmaceutical compositions described above. These compositions may be sterilized by conventional sterilization techniques, or may be sterile filtered. The resulting aqueous solutions may be packaged for use as is, or lyophilized, the lyophilized preparation being combined with a sterile aqueous carrier prior to administration. The pH of the compound preparations typically will be between about 3 and 11, more preferably from about 5 to 9 and most preferably from about 7 to 8. It will be understood that use of certain of the foregoing excipients, carriers, or stabilizers will result in the formation of pharmaceutical salts.<br>
[0196]   The therapeutic dosage of the compounds and/or compositions of the present invention will vary according to, for example, the particular use for which the treatment is made, the manner of administration of the compound, the health and condition of the patient, and the judgment of the prescribing physician. For example, for oral administration, the dose will typically be in the range of about 5 (ig to about 50 mg per kilogram body weight per day, preferably about 1 mg to about 10 mg per kilogram body weight per day. In the alternative, for intravenous administration, the dose will typically be in the range of about 5 ug to about 50 mg per kilogram body weight, preferably about 500 ug to about 5000 ug per kilogram body weight. Alternative routes of administration contemplated include, but are not limited to, intranasal, transdermal, inhaled, subcutaneous and intramuscular. Effective doses can be extrapolated from dose-response curves derived from in vitro or animal model test systems.<br>
86<br><br>
WO 2006/002236	PCT/US2005/022062<br>
[0197]    In general, the compounds and/or compositions of the subject invention will be administered in a therapeutically effective amount by any of the accepted modes of administration for agents that serve similar utilities. Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of such compounds can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for determining the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio LD50/ED50. Compounds that exhibit large therapeutic indices are preferred.<br>
[0198]   The data obtained from the cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in humans. The dosage of such compounds lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED50 with little or no . toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. For any compound and/or composition used in the method of the invention, the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. A dose may be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range which includes the IC50 (the concentration of the test compound which achieves a half-maximal inhibition of activity) as determined in cell culture. Such information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans. Levels in plasma may be measured, for example, by high performance liquid chromatography.<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
[0200]   Referring to the examples that follow, compounds of the present invention were synthesized using the methods described herein, or other methods, which are well known in the art.<br>
[0201]   The compounds and/or intermediates were characterized by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a Waters Millenium chromatography system with a 2690 Separation Module (Milford, MA). The analytical columns were Alltima C-18 reversed phase, 4.6 x 250 mm from Alltech (Deerfield, IL). A gradient elution was used, typically starting with 5% acetonitrile/95% water and progressing to 100% acetonitrile over a period of 40 minutes. All solvents contained 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). Compounds were detected by ultraviolet light (UV) absorption at either 220 or 254 nm. HPLC solvents were from Burdick and Jackson (Muskegan, MI), or Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA). In some instances, purity was assessed by thin layer chromatography (TLC) using glass or plastic backed silica gel plates, such as, for example, Baker-Flex Silica Gel 1B2-F flexible sheets. TLC results were readily detected visually under ultraviolet light, or by employing well known iodine vapor and other various staining techniques.<br>
[0202]   Mass spectrometric analysis was performed on one of two LCMS instruments: a Waters System (Alliance HT HPLC and a Micromass ZQ mass spectrometer; Column: Eclipse XDB-C18,2.1 x 50 mm; solvent system: 5-95% (or 35-95%, or 65-95% or 95-95%) acetonitrile in water with 0.05% TFA; flow rate 0.8 ml/min; molecular weight range 500-1500; cone Voltage 20 V; column temperature 40ยฐC) or a Hewlett Packard System (Series 1100 HPLC; Column: Eclipse XDB-C18,2.1 x 50 mm; solvent system: 1-95% acetonitrile in<br>

water with 0.05% TFA; flow rate 0.4 ml/min; molecular weight range 150-850; cone Voltage 50 V; column temperature 30ยฐC). All masses were reported as those of the protonated parent ions.<br>
[0203]    GCMS analysis is performed on a Hewlett Packard instrument (HP6890 Series gas chromatograph with a Mass Selective Detector 5973; injector volume: 1 ml; initial column temperature: 50ยฐC; final column temperature: 250ยฐC; ramp time: 20 minutes; gas flow rate: 1 ml/min; column: 5% phenyl methyl siloxane, Model No. HP 190915-443, dimensions: 30.0 m x 25 m x 0.25 m).<br>
[0204]   Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis was performed on some of the compounds with a Varian 300 MHz NMR (Palo Alto, CA). The spectral reference was either TMS or the known chemical shift of the solvent. Some compound samples were run at elevated temperatures (e.g., 75ยฐC) to promote increased sample solubility.<br>
[0205]    The purity of some of the invention compounds is assessed by elemental analysis (Desert Analytics, Tucson, AZ).<br>
[0206]   Melting points are determined on a Laboratory Devices Mel-Temp apparatus (Holliston, MA).<br>
[0207]   Preparative separations were carried out using a Flash 40 chromatography system and KP-Sil, 60A (Biotage, Charlottesville, VA), or by flash column chromatography using silica gel (230-400 mesh) packing material, or by HPLC using a C-18 reversed phase column. Typical solvents employed for the Flash 40 Biotage system and flash column chromatography were dichloromethane, methanol, ethyl acetate, hexane, acetone, aqueous hydroxyamine and triethyl amine. Typical solvents employed for the reverse phase HPLC were varying concentrations of acetonitrile and water with 0.1% trifiuoroacetic acid.<br>

Assay for Determining KSP Activity<br>
[0326]   This example provides a representative in vitro assay for determining KSP activity in vitro. Purified microtubules obtained from bovine brain were purchased from Cytoskeleton Inc. (Denver, Colorado, USA). The motor domain of human KSP (Eg 5, KNSL1) was cloned, expressed, and purified to greater than 95% homogeneity. Biomol Green was purchased from Affinity Research Products Ltd. (Matford Court, Exeter, Devon, United Kingdom). Microtubules and KSP motor protein (/. e., the KSP motor domain) were diluted in assay buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mM MgCl2,10 mM DTT and 0.25 mg/ml BSA) to a final concentration of 35 ug/ml microtubules and 45 nM KSP. The microtubule/KSP mixture was then pre-incubated at 37ยฐC for 10 min to promote the binding of KSP to microtubules.<br>
[0327]    To each well of the testing plate (384-well plate) containing 1.25 ยตl of inhibitor or test compound in DMSO (or DMSO only in the case of controls) were added 25 ยตl of<br>
244<br><br>
WO 2006/002236	PCT/US2005/022062<br>
ATP solution (ATP diluted to a concentration of 300 ยตM in assay buffer) and 25 ยตl of the above-described microtubule/KSP solution. The plates were incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. Following incubation, 65 ยตl of Biomol Green (a malachite green-based dye that detects the release of inorganic phosphate) was added to each well. The plates were incubated for an additional 5-10 minutes then the absorbance at 630 nm was determined using a Victor II plate reader. The amount of absorbance at 630 nm corresponded to the amount of KSP activity in the samples. The IC50 of each inhibitor or test compound was then determined based on the decrease in absorbance at 630 nm at each concentration, via nonlinear regression using either XLFit for Excel or Prism data analysis software by GraphPad Software Inc.<br>

Inhibition of Cellular Proliferation in Tumor Cell Lines Treated with KSP Inhibitors [0328]   Cells were plated in 96~well plates at densities from 500 cells/well of a 96-well plate and allowed to adhere/grow for 24 hours. They were then treated with various concentrations of drug for 72 hours. Than 100 ยตl of CellTiter Glo is added, atetrazolium-based assay using the reagent 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl) 5- (3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) (U.S. Patent No. 5,185,450) (see Promega product catalog #G3580, CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay), and incubated in the dark for 30 minutes. The amount of luminescence was determined for each well using a Walloc Trilux plate reader, which correlates with the number of cells/well. The number of viable cells in the wells, that received only DMSO (0.5%) serve as the 0% inhibition data point, while wells without cells serve as 100% inhibition of cell growth. The drug concentration that resulted in a 50% growth inhibition (GI50) was determined graphically from sigmoidal dose-response curves<br>
