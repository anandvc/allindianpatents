				<td>FLAVOURED SUGARCANE JUICE IN ASEPTIC UNIT PACKS<br>
Technical Field<br>
This invention relates to a process for preservation of sugarcane juice. The process, in<br>
particular, relates to the method of preservation of flavoured sugarcane juice in<br>
aseptic unit packs. By following the process of the present invention, sugarcane juice<br>
containing 18-20% soluble solids and can be preserved after suitable dilution. The<br>
product is derived purely from natural plant material and imparts health benefits to the<br>
consumers. The juice with its delicate aroma is a refreshing beverage, which the<br>
consumers prefer to synthetically flavoured beverages.<br>
Background Art<br>
India is the original home of sugarcane and second largest producer next to Brazil.<br>
Presently, India produces about 280 million tonnes of sugarcane in an area of 4<br>
million hectares. About 10 -12% is available for the manufacture of sugarcane juice.<br>
It is a well known fact that sugarcanes are crushed to obtain juice and it is a common<br>
practice in India to dispense this juice fresh either as such or with the addition of lime<br>
juice and/or fresh ginger extract in glasses by the vendors/hawkers to the consumers.<br>
The major problem encountered in this operation is the lack of hygiene resulting in<br>
contamination of the juice with the heavy load of microorganisms, which arise due to<br>
improper cleaning of the sugarcanes and handling of the finished product. Raw<br>
sugarcane juice is a carbohydrate rich, low acid food and is therefore susceptible to<br>
the growth of yeasts, of spoilage bacteria and also of pathogenic bacteria. Pathogens<br>
such as Salmonella, S.aureus, C.perfringens are able to grow and proliferate at a pH<br>
of more than 4.6. Contamination of raw juice by these bacteria can occur by the food<br>
handlers, by the equipment used or by the environment in which it is prepared. Such<br>
freshly crushed juice cannot be preserved even for a few hours since it is known to<br>
ferment very quickly.<br>
Attempts have been made by many to develop a process for preserving the sugarcane<br>
juice. Yet there is no knowledge / information regarding its manufacture and sale in<br>
any form of packaging material commercially.<br>
Reference may be made to CFTRI process (Shankaranarayana, M.L., Abraham, K.O<br>
andRaghavan, B, CFTRI Annual Report, 1986-87, p 70) wherein the juice was<br>
subjected to pasteurization at 70°C for 10 min. The drawback with the product was<br>
browning and formation of off-flavor not acceptable to consumers.<br>
Reference may be made to Mann and Singh [Mann, R.S and Singh, S. Indian<br>
Farming, 37; 15, 1988] wherein the diluted sugarcane juice containing citric acid and<br>
salt was pasteurized in order to overcome deleterious effects on the consumers. The<br>
drawback of the process was the absence of class II preservatives and low<br>
pasteurization temperature, which resulted in quicker spoilage even at refrigerated<br>
temperature.<br>
Reference may be made to Bhupinder et al., [Bhupinder, K., Sehgal, V.K., Sekhon,<br>
K.S. and Sharrna, K., Proc IIIFCON, CFTRI, 1988, p. 105} wherein a ready to serve<br>
bottled sugarcane juice beverage was developed. The drawback of this process was<br>
the absence of citric acid in the beverage and also pasteurization for 10 minutes at<br>
80°C which is insufficient to preserve the beverage. Also, this is in-pack sterilization<br>
and not aseptic unit packs and hence is different from the present invention.<br>
Reference may also be made to Bhupinder et al. [Bhupinder, K., Sharma, K.P and<br>
Harinder, K., Int. J Trop Agric., 9, p. 128, 1991] wherein the above process was<br>
slightly modified by addition of potassium metabisulphite (sulphur dioxide 70 ppm)<br>
and bottling followed by sterilization for 30 minutes. The drawback with this process<br>
was extended pasteurization time, which will result in flavour deterioration.<br>
Reference may be made to another process involving direct heating of the juice to<br>
85°C for one minute [Sivasubramanian, G. and Pai, J.S., Ind. Food Packer, XLVIII<br>
(2), 51, 1994]. But the resultant product had an off-flavour on storage.<br>
Among the 19 patents related to sugarcane juice that are available, only one relates to<br>
a method for preparing a sugarcane juice based fruit juice and a drink containing said<br>
juice [L.Fahrasmane and M.Catherine WO2000FR0000765, October 5, 2000/March<br>
27 2000]. The above invention consists of atleast one tangential filtration stage for a<br>
dry pressed raw sugarcane extract. One more Indian patent has also been filed under<br>
the title "Preservation process for improved shelf life of sugarcane juice (pure)<br>
[K.P.Sharma, 184435, August 26 2000].<br>
It is evident from the above cited literature that there is no patent or published<br>
information regarding flavoured sugarcane juice in aseptic unit packs.<br>
Objects of the Present Invention<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process for preservation of<br>
flavored sugarcane juice in aseptic unit packs.<br>
Another object of present invention is to provide a compatible flavor blend<br>
comprising of ginger and lime / lemon that can be incorporated into sugarcane juice to<br>
provide a better aroma and mouth feel.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a process for preparing flavored<br>
sugarcane juice and storage of the flavored sugarcane juice in aseptic unit packs.<br>
Brief Description of the Accompanying Drawings<br>
In the drawings accompanying the specification,<br>
Figure 1 represents the flow chart of the process for the preservation of sugarcane<br>
juice in aseptic unit packs.<br>
Figure 2 shows the material balance of the constituents obtained for Example 3.<br>
Detailed Description of the Present Invention<br>
The present invention provides a process for preservation of flavored sugarcane juice,<br>
the said process comprising:<br>
a) soaking the canes in water containing 0.1% by wt. potassium metabisulphite<br>
and 0.01% by wt. citric acid for a period of 2-4 hrs,<br>
b) washing the soaked sugarcanes of step (a) and crushing the same to obtain<br>
sugarcane juice having 18-20° Brix, and filtering the sugarcane juice,<br>
c) adjusting the total solid content of the filtered sugarcane juice of step (b) to<br>
10-16° Brix by adding soft beverage water,<br>
d) acidifying the sugarcane juice of step (c) by adding 0.1-0.3% by wt. citric<br>
acid and 0.01-0.03% by wt. sodium citrate,<br>
e) adding to the acidified sugarcane juice of step (d) a flavor blend consisting of<br>
0.05-0.20% by wt. of ginger oleoresin and/or 0.01-0.05% by wt. of essential<br>
oils of lime and lemon to obtain a flavored sugarcane juice,<br>
f) blending the flavored sugarcane juice of step (e) and pasteurizing the same at<br>
90-110°C for 30-180 sec to obtain the flavored sugarcane juice which may be<br>
filled in aseptic unit packs.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, wherein in step (b), the sugarcanes are<br>
washed with plain water before crushing.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, wherein the sugarcanes are crushed<br>
using mechanical devices.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, wherein in step (b), the sugarcane<br>
juice is filtered using muslin cloth.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, wherein in step (c) the sugarcane<br>
juice is diluted with beverage water to adjust the sweetness at 15%.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, wherein in step (d), the sugarcane<br>
juice is acidified by adding 0.2% by wt. citric acid and 0.02% by wt. sodium citrate.<br>
The process for the preservation of sugarcane juice in aseptic unit packs is illustrated<br>
in Figure 1. The novelty of the process lies in the combined manner in which critical<br>
steps such as pre-treatment of the sugarcanes, homogenization of the juice with a<br>
flavor blend consisting of ginger and lime-lemon flavors in such a manner as to<br>
dispense the flavor in the bulk of the juice and pasteurization at specific temperature<br>
for a particular duration are carried out in order to preserve the sugarcane juice. It has<br>
been found that by following the process as described above, the Inventors have been<br>
successful in preserving the natural taste of sugarcane juice without browning and offflavoring<br>
the sugarcane juice.<br>
The applicability of the process is further illustrated in the following examples which<br>
are given by way for illustrating the present invention in a much better manner and<br>
hence, should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention in any<br>
manner.<br>
Example 1<br>
Sugarcanes (1.2 tonnes) were procured, roots and stems trimmed to obtain 1 tonne of<br>
cleaned canes. These were soaked in KMS solution for 2 hours. Then the canes were<br>
thoroughly washed and juice extracted using the twin roller crusher with SS rollers.<br>
500 L of juice (20 °Brix) was obtained and collected in a chiller tank with recirculation<br>
facility, maintained at 4°C. The brix was brought down to 15.4 by adding<br>
soft water (150 L). The product was thawed, pH adjusted to 3.70 by adding citric acid<br>
(0.2%) and sodium citrate (0.02%). The total quantity of juice was 650 L. After pH<br>
and brix adjustment, the juice was pumped to homogeniser at 140 bar and<br>
subsequently to sterilizer to pasteurize at 95°C for 60 s. Pasteurized juice was stored<br>
in an aseptic tank with steam locks. Meanwhile, the filling section of the processor<br>
was sterilized with superheated water. Subsequently, the juice was filled into 250 ml<br>
aseptic unit packs.<br>
Example 2<br>
Sugarcanes (1.4 tonnes) were thoroughly cleaned to remove the waxy layer by<br>
scraping the rind. The final weight of the cleaned canes were 1050 kg and were<br>
soaked in KMS solution for 4 h. The canes were washed with running water and<br>
crushed to obtain 510 liters of juice (20°Brix). The juice was diluted to 15.2°Brix by<br>
adding soft water (160L). Citric acid (0.2%), sodium citrate (0.02%) and flavour<br>
blend (500 ml) consisting of ginger oleoresin (70 g) duly emulsified in propylene<br>
glycol were added. The juice was pumped to homogeniser at 140 bars through deaerator<br>
and subsequently to sterilizer and pasteurized at 105°C for 60 s. Subsequently,<br>
the juice was filled into 250 ml aseptic unit packs.<br>
Example 3<br>
1.2 tonnes of canes were procured, roots and stem were trimmed. The sugarcanes<br>
were thoroughly cleaned to remove the waxy layer by scraping the rind. The cleaned<br>
canes were soaked in KMS solution for 4 h. The canes were washed with running<br>
water, crushed to obtain about 480 liters of juice (17 °Brix) followed by dilution with<br>
soft water (55 L) to adjust the brix to 15.2°. Citric acid and sodium citrate at the levels<br>
of 0.2 and 0.02% respectively and a flavour blend (500 ml) consisting of ginger<br>
oleoresin (70 g) and terpeneless lime and lemon oil (7.5 ml each) duly emulsified in<br>
propylene glycol was added to the juice and pumped to the homogeniser at 140 bars<br>
through de-aerator and subsequently to sterilizer for pasteurization at 95°C for 60 s.<br>
Subsequently, the juice was filled into 250 ml aseptic unit packs. The material balance<br>
for example 3 is shown in figure 2.<br><br><br><br>
