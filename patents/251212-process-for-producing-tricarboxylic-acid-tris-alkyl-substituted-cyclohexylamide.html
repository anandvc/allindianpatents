				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
PROCESS FOR PRODUCING TRICARBOXYLIC ACID TRIS(ALKYL-SUBSTITUTED CYCLOHEXYLAMIDE)<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a novel process for producing a tricarboxylic acid tris(alkyl-substituted cyclohexylamide), and more particularly relates to a process for producing a tricarboxylic acid tris(alkyl-substituted cyclohexylamide) by an amidation reaction of a tricarboxylic acid and an alkyl-substituted cyclohexylamine.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Because of their excellent moldability, mechanical properties, electrical properties, and so forth, polyolefin resins are used in many different fields as materials for film molding, sheet molding, blow molding, injection molding, and so on.<br>
However, while these resins generally do have excellent properties, they are less than satisfactory in terms of transparency, crystallinity, and rigidity, and in some applications the excellent performance inherent in such resins cannot be fully taken advantage of, and at present this limits the applications of these resins. A technique in which an amide compound is employed has been proposed in the past in an effort to improve the transparency, crystallinity, and rigidity of polyolefin resins (see Patent Documents 1-3).<br>
A number of processes have been disclosed up to now for producing a 1,2,3-propanetricarboxylic acid tris(alkyl-substituted cyclohexylamide) as the above-mentioned amide compound.<br>
For example, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application H7-242610 (Patent Document 2) gives a preparation example in which 1,2,3-propanetricarboxylic acid tris(cyclohexylamide) and 1,2,3-propanetricarboxylic acid tris(2-methylcyclohexylamide)are obtained by reacting 1,2,3-propanetricarboxylic acid and cyclohexylamine or 2-methylcyclohexylamine in the presence of both triphenyl phosphite and pyridine.<br>
However, the triphenyl phosphite used in this process as an<br>
activator of carboxyl groups is extremely expensive, and furthermore, it has to be used in a large quantity, that is, in a stoichiometric amount, and this drives up the cost. Moreover, phosphorous-containing waste liquid is produced, and this necessitates treatment for environmental safety.<br>
In addition, a preparation is given in which<br>
1,2,3-propanetricarboxylic acid trimethyl ester and cyclohexylamine or 2-methylcyclohexylamine used in an amount corresponding to 3 to 30 equivalents thereof are subjected to an ester-amide interchange reaction for 6 hours at 220Â°C to obtain a corresponding 1,2,3-propanetricarboxylic acid tris(alkyl-substituted cyclohexylamide) (see Patent Document 4).<br>
However, this process entails a complicated step of producing a methyl ester of 1,2,3-propanetricarboxylic acid, and furthermore the reaction is conducted at a temperature not lower than the boiling point of cyclohexylamine, which means that a costly pressure-resistant equipment is required, and for this and other reasons this process has room for improvement in terms of producing and cost.<br>
Thus, a problem has been that a 1,2,3-propanetricarboxylic acid tris(alkyl-substituted cyclohexylamide) having the specific structure of the present invention cannot always be produced easily and with good productivity with conventional production processes.<br>
Meanwhile, it has been disclosed concerning amidation reaction that in an amidation reaction of N-acylamino acid and a primary amine, secondary amine or ammonia, a boric acid compound effectively serves as a dehydration condensation reaction catalyst, particularly in the presence of an aliphatic alcohol that serves as an auxiliary solvent (see Patent Document 5 and Patent Document 6). Boric acid compounds are inexpensive and readily available. Nevertheless, these publications include neither reference to nor implication of an amidation reaction between a tricarboxylic acid and an alkyl-substituted cyclohexylamine.

DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a simple process for producing a tricarboxylic acid tris(alkyl-substituted cyclohexylamide) that solves the problems of production, cost, and so forth encountered with conventional processes for producing tricarboxylic acid tris(alkyl-substituted cyclohexylamides).<br>
MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEM<br>
In light of this situation, the inventors conducted diligent study aimed at solving the above problems, and as a result learned the following.<br>
(a) If diboron trioxide, which is inexpensive and readily available, is used in an amidation reaction of 1,2,3-propanetricarboxylic acid and 2-methylcyclohexylamine, tricarboxylic acid tris (2-methylcyclohexylamide) is obtained, but the yield is extremely low, being about 20% at best.<br>
The cause of this low yield was examined, which revealed that the production of by-products having an imide ring structure is predominant. For example, in the case of an amidation reaction of 1,2,3-propanetricarboxylic acid and an alkyl-substituted cyclohexylamine, a by-product (hereinafter referred to as an "amide-imide") results that is represented by the following General Formula (4): [Chemical formula 1]<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R2 and R3 have the same meaning as R2 and R3 in General Formula (2) below. It was found that to solve this problem of low yield and selectively obtain the desired tricarboxylic acid tris(alky1-substituted cyclohexylamide) at a high yield, it is important to suppress this side reaction somehow.<br>
(b)	In view of this, the inventors subjected a tricarboxylic acid<br>
and an alkyl-substituted cyclohexylamine to an amidation reaction using<br>
diboron trioxide as a boric acid compound and 2-ethylhexanol as an<br>
aliphatic alcohol according to the process discussed in the above-<br>
mentioned Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application 2001-187769, whereupon<br>
the desired tricarboxylic acid tris(alkyl-substituted cyclohexylamide)<br>
was only obtained in a far lower yield (approximately 2%) than when<br>
diboron trioxide was used alone.<br>
It was therefore revealed that with this process it would be very difficult to obtain the desired tricarboxylic acid tris(alkyl-substituted cyclohexylamide) at a high yield. Accordingly, the inventors presumed that it was impossible to obtain the desired tricarboxylic acid tris (alkyl-substituted cyclohexylamide) at a yield over 20% when a boric acid compound is used.<br>
(c)	However, follow-up research by the inventors led to the<br>
surprising discovery that if diboron trioxide and a phenol compound are<br>
used, or if a boric acid ester obtained by the dehydration condensation<br>
of diboron trioxide and a phenol compound is used, as a dehydration<br>
condensation reaction catalyst in an amidation reaction of a<br>
tricarboxylic acid and an alkyl-substituted cyclohexylamine, a<br>
tricarboxylic acid tris (alkyl-substituted cyclohexylamide) can be<br>
produced more simply than in the past, and furthermore the formation of<br>
by-products is suppressed, the desired product is easy to purify, and<br>
the yield, purity, etc. of the desired product are satisfactory. The<br>
inventors also discovered that similar effect is obtained when another<br>
boric acid compound is used instead of diboron trioxide.<br>
(d)	Furthermore, it was found that the crude desired product thus<br>
obtained contains as impurities the amide-imide represented by the<br>
above-mentioned General Formula (4), the boric acid compound and phenol<br>
compound, or the boric acid ester of a phenol compound, used as a<br>
-catalyst, mono-, di-, or triamine salts (hereinafter referred to as "amine salts") that are amidation reaction intermediates of a tricarboxylic acid and an alkyl-substituted cyclohexylamine, and so forth, but that these impurities can be easily removed by a process that is extremely advantageous in an industrial setting, namely, by just washing with a solvent.<br>
The present invention was perfected as a result of further research based on the above findings, and provides a process for producing the tricarboxylic acid tris(alkyl-substituted cyclohexylamide), and a process for producing a purified tricarboxylic acid tris(alkyl-substituted cyclohexylamide) as mentioned below.<br>

EFFECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
With the production process of the present invention, compared to conventional production processes, a tricarboxylic acid tris(alkyl-substituted cyclohexylamide) that is useful as a clarifying agent for a polypropylene-based resin can be obtained easily and at good productivity.<br>

The present invention is particularly advantageous in that the desired product can be obtained with a good hue (white color). For instance, when using propanetricarboxylic acid produced by a hydrogen peroxide oxidation reaction in the presence of a phosphorus-tungsten catalyst, the reaction solution becomes yellow to green in color, and there was an apprehension that coloring components are adsorbed to the crystals of the desired compound. When the production and purification processes of the present invention are employed, however, a product with good hue (a white solid) is obtained.<br>

According to the process of the present invention for producing a tricarboxylic acid tris(alkyl-substituted cyclohexylamide), the desired tricarboxylic acid tris(alkyl-substituted cyclohexylamide) can be easily produced, for example, merely by adding a boric acid compound and a phenol compound, or a boric acid ester of a boric acid compound and a phenol compound, prepared in advance by a conventional process, to a mixture of a tricarboxylic acid and an alkyl-substituted cyclohexylamine, and heating the mixture, either in the presence or absence of an azeotropic dehydration solvent. In particular, the order in which the tricarboxylic acid, alkyl-substituted cyclohexylamine, and boric acid compound, phenol compound or boric acid ester and azeotropic dehydration solvent are added does not affect the reaction, and may be suitably selected in view of ease of operation.<br>
The above-mentioned alkyl-substituted cyclohexylamine is a reaction substrate, but is also believed to function as a reaction solvent. Also, the above-mentioned phenol compound is a constituent component of a catalyst, but is also believed to function as a reaction solvent.<br>
The effect of thus using a boric acid compound and a phenol compound, or a boric acid ester of a boric acid compound and a phenol compound, as a dehydration condensation catalyst is that the formation of iitade rings is suppressed and the yield of tricarboxylic acid tris(alkyl-substituted cyclohexylamide) is markedly increased, compared with the use of a boric acid compound alone.<br>
The heating temperature during the reaction with the present invention is preferably 98 to 180Â°C, and more preferably 120 to 160Â°C. The temperature is preferably at least 100Â°C so as to remove any water that is produced by the reaction, and the higher the heating temperature is, the more the reaction is accelerated, but a range of 120 to 160Â°C is preferable to suppress side reactions. A temperature at which reflux continuously occurs in the reaction system is usually preferred.<br>
With the present invention, the reaction can usually be conducted at atmospheric pressure, but the reaction system may also be put under reduced pressure to promote the removal of water from the reaction mixture. There are no particular restrictions on the reaction atmosphere, but the reaction is preferably conducted in the presence of an inert gas such as nitrogen or argon, or under an inert gas flow.<br>
The reaction time is preferably from 0.1 to 50 hours, and more preferably 1 to 30 hours.<br>
An azeotropic dehydration solvent may or may not be used in the present invention, but the use thereof is preferable from the standpoint of accelerating the reaction. Preferable azeotropic dehydration solvents are saturated aliphatic hydrocarbons, saturated alicyclic hydrocarbons, and aromatic hydrocarbons with a boiling point (the boiling point at 1 atm; the same applies hereinafter) of 98 to 180Â°C.<br>
Specific examples include compounds such as heptane, iso-octane, methylcyclohexane, ethylcyclohexane, dimethylcyclohexane, trimethylcyclohexane, cycloheptane, toluene, ethylbenzene, n-propylbenzene, isopropylbenzene, p-xylene, p-cymene, mesitylene, n-octane, n-nonane and n-decane, and mixtures thereof, having a boiling point of between 98 and 180Â°C. Of these, dimethylcyclohexane, ethylcyclohexane, trimethylcyclohexane, ethylbenzene, n-propylbenzene, n-octane and n-nonane, and mixtures thereof, having a boiling point of between 120 and 160Â°C, are preferable in terms of suppressing side reactions. Xylene or an azeotropic dehydration solvent mixture obtained by suitably mixing these solvents so that the boiling point is from 130 to 150Â°C is particularly preferable.<br>
When the azeotropic dehydration solvents are used, there are no particular restrictions on the amount to be used, but the amount is usually from 500 to 5000 weight parts, and preferably from 800 to 2500 weight parts, per 100 weight parts of a tricarboxylic acid.<br>
The proportion of an alkyl-substituted cyclohexylamine to a tricarboxylic acid in the present invention is preferably 3 to 50 moles, and more preferably 3 to 10 moles, and even more preferably 3 to 6 moles, of an alkyl-substituted cyclohexylamine per mole of a<br>
tricarboxylic acid. Any excess alkyl-substituted cyclohexylamine used can be separated from the desired product produced in the reaction, and then reused.<br>
The boric acid compound that is used as a catalyst in the present invention can be any boric acid compound, and particularly an inorganic boric acid compound, capable of forming a boric acid ester with a phenol compound. Specific examples include orthoboric acid, metaboric acid, pyroboric acid, tetraboric acid, diboron trioxide, etc. Of these, orthoboric acid and diboron trioxide are preferable, and orthoboric acid is particularly preferable because it readily dissolves in the purification solvent used in the purification step discussed below, and can be easily separated from the desired product. These compounds can be used singly or as mixtures of two or more types.<br>
There are no particular restrictions on the amount of the boric acid compound used, but it is usually 0.1 to 10 moles, and preferably 0.5 to 5 moles, per mole of tricarboxylic acid. The reaction promotion effect will tend to be inadequate if the amount is less than 0.1 moles, whereas even if more than 10 moles is used, the reaction promotion effect will tend not to improve in proportion to the amount used.<br>
There are no particular restrictions on the phenol compound, so long as it can form a boric acid ester with the above-mentioned boric acid compound, but it is generally preferable to use benzene having one or two, preferably one, hydroxy groups, and optionally having one to three, preferably one to two, substituents. Examples of these substituents include C1 to C3 alkyl groups, specific examples of which include methyl, ethyl, and isopropyl.<br>
Specific examples of phenol compounds include phenol, m-cresol, o-cresol, p-cresol, p-methoxyphenol, xylenol, catechol, etc. These can be used singly or as mixtures of two or more. Of these, phenol and cresol are particularly preferable.<br>
There are no particular restrictions on the amount of the phenol compound used, but the amount is usually 0.5 to 20 moles, and preferably 1.0 to 10 moles, per mole of tricarboxylic acid. The reaction promotion effect will tend to be inadequate if the amount is less than 0.5 moles, whereas even if more than 20 moles is used, the<br>
reaction promotion effect will tend not to improve in proportion to the amount used.<br>
Examples of a boric acid ester of a boric acid compound and a phenol compound include boric acid esters of the above-mentioned boric acid compounds and the above-mentioned phenol compounds, of which a boric acid ester of a boric acid compound and cresol is particularly preferable. The boric acid esters can be easily prepared by subjecting a boric acid compound and a phenol compound to dehydration condensation by a conventional process in the presence of an azeotropic dehydration solvent (see Example 4 below). As such azeotropic dehydration solvent, any of those listed in regard to the amidation reaction can be used.<br>
There are no particular restrictions on the amount of the boric acid ester used, but the amount is usually 0.1 to 10 moles, and preferably 0.5 to 5 moles, per mole of tricarboxylic acid. The reaction promotion effect will tend to be inadequate if the amount is less than 0.1 moles, whereas even if more than 10 moles is used, the reaction promotion effect will tend not to improve in proportion to the amount used.<br>
As the above-mentioned reaction of the present invention proceeds, the tricarboxylic acid tris(alkyl-substituted cyclohexylamide) produced precipitates as a solid from the reaction mixture.<br>
The method for recovering the desired tricarboxylic acid tris(alkyl-substituted cyclohexylamide) upon completion of the reaction can be suitably selected. For instance, the desired product in the form of a solid that precipitates from the reaction mixture upon completion of the amidation reaction can be isolated by a conventional process such as filtration or centrifugation.<br>
The reaction of the present invention affords a high conversion of the raw material tricarboxylic acid, and also a satisfactory yield of crude tricarboxylic acid tris(alkyl-substituted cyclohexylamide). In particular, using a mixture of a boric acid compound and a phenol compound, or a boric acid ester of phenol, according to the present invention suppresses imide ring formation and remarkably increases the yield of tricarboxylic acid tris(alkyl-substituted cyclohexylamide), compared to the case in which a boric acid compound is used alone.<br>
Meanwhile, the reaction mother liquor obtained by filtering the desired product (crude tricarboxylic acid tris(alkyl-substituted cyclohexylamide)) can be subjected to an amidation reaction again as needed by adding a tricarboxylic acid, an alkyl-substituted cyclohexylamine, and an azeotropic dehydration solvent. <purification step><br>
The solid thus obtained, namely, the crude tricarboxylic acid tris (alkyl-substituted cyclohexylamide), contains the amide-imide represented by the above-mentioned General Formula (4), the boric acid compound and phenol compound, or the boric acid ester of a phenol compound, used as a catalyst, amine salts, and so forth as impurities.<br>
Since these impurities include both organic and inorganic substances, removal of the impurities was considered either difficult or time-consuming with an ordinary purification process such as recrystallization. Research conducted by the inventors, however, has led to the surprising finding that these ihnpurities can all be removed at once, and a high-purity tricarboxylic acid tris (alkyl-substituted cyclohexylamide) can be produced, by a simple process involving just washing with a solvent.<br>
Therefore, the present invention provides a process for producing a purified tricarboxylic acid tris(alkyl-substituted cyclohexylamide), which comprises the step of washing the above-mentioned crude tricarboxylic acid tris (alkyl-substituted cyclohexylamide) with a solvent.<br>
There are no particular restrictions on the solvent to be used in the above purification, so long as it is capable of dissolving the above-mentioned impurities contained in the crude tricarboxylic acid tris(alkyl-substituted cyclohexylamide).<br>
The above-mentioned purification solvent is preferably methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, or like C1 to C3 lower aliphatic alcohol, or a mixture of these alcohols, or a mixed solvent of water and a Ci to Cj lower aliphatic alcohol, with methanol and ethanol being particularly preferable. When a mixed solvent of water and a lower aliphatic alcohol is used, the ratio of water to lower alcohol can be suitably selected from a wide range. Generally, the ratio of water: lower<br>
alcohol is preferably about 9:1 to 1:9, particularly about 5:5 to 1:9.<br>
There are no particular restrictions on the amount of the lower alcohol used, but the lower alcohol is preferably used in an amount of 200 to 5000 weight parts per 100 weight parts of crude tricarboxylic acid tris(alkyl-substituted cyclohexylamide). This allows any byproducts and boric acid compound or boric acid ester, amine salts, etc., in the desired product to be removed with ease.<br>
When a mixture of water and a lower alcohol is used, there are no particular restrictions on the amounts of such a mixture, but the mixture is preferably used in an amount of 200 to 5000 weight parts per 100 weight parts of crude tricarboxylic acid tris(alkyl-substituted cyclohexylamide).<br>
Examples of washing method include a method in which the filtered desired product (crude tricarboxylic acid tris(alkyl-substituted cyclohexylamide)) is dispersed in a purification solvent and stirred and mixed at a temperature between room temperature and the boiling point of the purification solvent (generally from room temperature to about 100Â°C, and preferably from room temperature to about 90Â°C, and more preferably from room temperature to about 80Â°C); and a method in which a solid of the desired product is showered with a purification solvent. These methods can also be suitably combined. The desired tricarboxylic acid tris(alkyl-substituted cyclohexylamide) can be easily obtained in a high purity by subjecting the washed solid to operations that are normally carried out, such as filtration and reduced-pressure drying.<br>
The extent of the purification in the above-mentioned purification step can be suitably selected according to the type and amount of purification solvent used, the washing duration, the washing temperature, and so forth. From an industrial standpoint, it is preferable if the boron content measured by subjecting the tricarboxylic acid tris(alkyl-substituted cyclohexylamide) thus obtained to ICP spectrometry (inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry) is 100 ppm or less, and more preferably 50 ppm or less, and even more preferably 20 ppm or less<br>
The present invention will now be described in further detail by giving Examples, but the present invention is not limited whatsoever by these examples. The starting substances used here are either known compounds or compounds that can be produced by a known process.<br>
In the following discussion, the "yield" is the yield based on the raw material tricarboxylic acid. It has been confirmed from FT-IR that the raw material tricarboxylic acid forms an amine salt that is a reaction intermediate with 2-methylcyclohexylamine, and the conversion thereof is 100%. Since the desired product that is obtained is substantially insoluble under the following reaction conditions, the yield is substantially equal to the selectivity.<br>
