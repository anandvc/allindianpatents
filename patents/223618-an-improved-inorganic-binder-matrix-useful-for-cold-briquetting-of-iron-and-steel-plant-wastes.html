				<td>This invention relates to a process for the manufacture of composite briquettes of iron and steel plant wastes by cold briquetting. The present invention particularly relates to a process for cold briquetting of steel plant wastes sucii as iron ore fines, flue dust, mill scale, coi^e Tn.^s and the like with an improved binder matrix, consisting of a combination of different in-organic binders, to make composite briquettes. The briquettes thus obtained have adequate green strength, cold-crushing strength and RDI and are suitable as blast furnace charge.<br>
Iron and Steel industries, operating all over he world, produce waste materials like, slag, mill-scale and flue dust besides generating a huge quantity of iron ore and coke fines. These wastes cause a lot of storage and environmental related problems besides wastage of valuable resources. In recciit times, efforts have been m.ade to uti these fines employing agglomeration techniques like, pelletisation and briqueiting as pan of zero waste concept. Worldwide, for the 700 million tons of steel produced annually, an estimated 30 million tons of recycle wastes are generated. A typical Indian integrated steel plant of 3 million tons per annum capacity generates around 100,000 tons of iron oxide fines, 55.000 tons of coke fines. 15,000 tons of flue dust and 17,000 tons of mill-scale.<br>
In the known prior art, a few of the steel plants abroad, specially U.S.A., utilise the ore fines generated during steel making, through briquetting method using various organic and/or inorganic binders.<br>
National Steel Corporation, Great lakes division, Chicago. U.S.A. recycle the revert dust/sludges and other materials generated from iron and steel making process through briquetting using inorganic blast furnace binder containing sodium silicate.<br><br>
U.S. steel, Gary Works, U.S.A. use molasses-cement as binder to produce briquettes which are used as charge for blast furnace and steel making furnaces. U.S. Steel, Edgar, U.S.A., use cement-molasses binder for briquetting revert materials like basic oxygen furnace (BOF) sludge, flue dust. The molasses based binder system causes operational problems like bad odour and ammonia- phenol build-up in recycle water stream.<br>
Bethlehem Steel Corporation, U.S.A., use cement as binder for extrusion of BOF dust.<br>
National Recovery Systems Inc., U.S.A., developed a process to recycle waste oxides in the steel industry by cold bonded rolled briquettes. National Recovery System USA has developed a briquetting process using an inorganic binder for briquetting steel plant revert materials like BOF dust, BOF sludge and flue dust.<br>
The main disadvantages of the above briquetting processes, referred above, are that the binders used causes (i) bad odour, (ii) ammonia-phenol build up in recycle water system, (iii) requirement of extensive gas cleaning, (iv) lower strength of briquettes at high temperature and (v) decrease in strength of briquettes under reducing atmosphere encountered in blastfurnace. Further the above processes do not use coke fines in briquetting of waste oxides from blast furnace / steel industries.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process for the manufacture of composite briquettes of iron and steel plant wastes by cold briquetting, which obviates the drawbacks of the hitherto known prior art.<br><br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide and improved inorganic binder matrix useflil for making briquettes suitable as blast furnace charge.<br>
The improved inorganic binder matrix of the present invention provides synergistic combination of inorganic binders consisting of pyrophiilte, cement / granulated slag and activated sodium silicate, useful for making composite briquettes from steel plant wastes like iron ore fines, flue dust, mill scale, coke fines by cold briquetting.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides an improved inorganic binder matrix useful for cold briquetting of iron and steel plant wastes, which comprises characterized in that a synergistic mixture of inorganic binders essentially consisting of commercial grade pyrophiilte, cement/granulated slag and activated sodium silicate in a ratio in the range of 5 to 10:5 to 10:3 to 7 by wt., respectively.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the pyrophiilte is of commercial grade.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the cement/granulated slag is of- 100 |i size.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the granulated slag is an industrial waste / by-product.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the cement/granulated slag is of commercial grade.<br><br>
In a further embodiment of the present invention, the activated sodium silicate is of commercial grade.<br>
The improved inorganic binder matrix of the present invneiton is not a mere admixture but a synergistic mixture having properties which are distinct from the mere aggregation of the properties of the individual ingredients and there is no chemical reaction.<br>
The improved inorganic binder matrix of the present invention provides different combination of inorganic binders in the ratio range as detailed above, useful for making composite briquettes using steel plant wastes like iron ore fines, flue dust, mill scale, coke fines by cold briquetting.<br>
In a co-pending patent application no 1223/del/2002 we have described and claimed a process for the manufacture of composite briquettes of iron and steel plant wastes by cold briquetting with an improved inorganic binder matrix. The steel plant wastes used in cold briquetting are in a combination of iron ore fines of - 6 mm size, flue dust of - 3 mm zide, mill scale of- 6 mm size and coke fines of-6 mm size. The combination of inorganic binders used on the basis of wt% of charge materials are: pyrophilite in the range of 5-10%, cement/granulated slag of (-100 [x size) in the range of 5 - 10% and activated commercial grade sodium silicate (NazO : SiOz == 1:1 ) in the range of 3 - 7%.<br>

press by applying a vertical compression load of the order of 350-450 kg/cm^ and 100-200 kg/cm^ to obtain the cylindrical and elliptical briquettes, respectively, and curing the such briquettes so obtained, under natural conditions for a period of 3-6 days.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the steel plant wastes are in a combination of iron ore fines of - 6 mm size, flue dust of - 3 mm size, mill scale of - 6 mm size and coke fines of - 6 mm size.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the vertical compression load<br>
used in briquetting machine for making cylindrical briquettes is preferably 400<br>
kg/cm^<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the vertical compression<br>
load used in briquetting roll press for making elliptical briquettes is preferably<br>
