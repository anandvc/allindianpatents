COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See section 10 and rulel3)<br>
1.	TITLE OF THE INVENTION:<br>
"MANUFACTURING OF LIGHT WEIGHT FIBER CEMENT BUILDING<br>
BOARDS"<br>
2.	APPLICANT:<br>
(a) NAME: EVEREST INDUSTRIES LIMITED<br>
(b)NATIONALITY: Indian Company incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956<br>
(c) ADDRESS: Gat 152, Lakhmapur Village, Dindori Taluka,<br>
Post Bag No.5, District Nashik -422202, Maharashtra, India.<br>
3.	PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION:<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be formed.<br>
 <br>
FIELD OF INVENTION:<br>
The present invention relates to lightweight cementitious cellulose fiber reinforced building material without using any Low Density Additive (LDA). The invention further relates to it's preparation and standardization.<br>
BACKGROUND &amp; PRIOR ART:<br>
Cement is binder substance that binds other materials and, if mixed with water, reacts with water and becomes as hard as stone. A fiber-reinforced cement material, commonly known as fiber cement, contains fiber reinforcement that contributes to making the fiber cement material even stronger. As on today, the fiber-reinforced cement material is largely used in the construction products, such as cladding, flooring and other applications, due to it's hardness, performance and commercial value.<br>
Fiber-reinforced cement products were invented by Ludwig Hatschek in the 19th century. Therefore, the process by which the fiber-reinforced cement products are prepared is called as Hatschek process. Initially, cement and asbestos fibers were used to produce the fiber-reinforced cement products. But as adverse effects of asbestos were came into light, safer fiber alternatives, such as cellulose fibers, were developed. US Patent 4543159 discloses a process for making a cement and non-asbestos fiber mat on a Hatschek machine.<br>
Suitable additives are extensively used in cementitious building material to obtain lightweight or make the density lower. In all cases, use of additives have been invariably reported.<br>
The use of lightweight cementitious cellulose fiber reinforced building material by using Low Density Additive (LDA) has been widely reported across the globe. US Patent No. 7727329 relates to the addition of low density additives into cementitious cellulose fiber-reinforced building materials to obtain lightweight cementitious cellulose fiber reinforced building material. US Patent No. 7727329 further discloses a fiber cement building<br>
 <br>
material which comprises low density additives such as volcanic ash, hollow ceramic microspheres or combination thereof.<br>
The present inventors have resolved the problem of preparing high strength reinforced low density material without using additives.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION:<br>
The present invention discloses preparation of lightweight, low density cementitious cellulose fiber reinforced building material wherein lightweight, low density is achieved by use of high amount of fibrous-reinforcing material and not by the use of Low Density Additive (LDA).<br>
The present invention further discloses lightweight cementitious cellulose fiber reinforced building material comprising a hydraulic binder, a filler and pozzolonic material, a silicious material, a fibrous-reinforcing material. The lightweight cementitious cellulose fiber reinforced building material is prepared without using any additives as have been done hereto.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a novel formulation of lightweight cementitious cellulose fiber reinforced building material with improved workability and dimensional stability, wherein low density is achieved by use of high amount of fibrous-reinforcing material and in absence of Low Density Additive (LDA).<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the present invention provides a formulation of lightweight cementitious cellulose fiber reinforced building material wherein the fibrous-reinforcing cellulosic material consists of Virgin Wood Cellulose Pulp in an amount 10-15% by weight along with a hydraulic binder, a filler and pozzolonic material, a siliceous material, a fibrous mineral, Bauxite, Bentonite clay and Silicon water repellant additive.<br>
 <br>
The hydraulic binder is selected from Portland Cement and is present in an amount 30-40% by weight. The filler and pozzolonic material is selected form pulverized fly ash and is present in an amount 20-30% by weight. The siliceous material is selected from quartz/ sand powder and is present in an amount 20-25% by weight. The fibrous mineral is Wollastonite present in an amount 4-10%. The Bauxite is present in an amount 3-6% by weight. The Bentonite clay is present in an amount 0.5-2% by weight. The Silicon water repellant additives are in amounts 0.1-0.5% by weight.<br>
Further, the virgin wood cellulose pulp acts as a fiber and helps in reinforcing powder material. The Portland cement is used for strength and holding other raw material. The pulverized fly ash bonds with Portland cement. The quartz/sand powder reacts with Portland cement at high temperature. Fibrous mineral wollastonite is used to improve the dimensional stability and moisture movement of the product. The bauxite is used for arresting expansion and shrinkage and also improves the durability of the product with the formation of 11A Al-Tobermorite in the product. The bentonite clay is used for improving interlamina bonding and the silicon water repellant additive is used for improving water resistance and reducing water absorption. The addition of silicon additive and fibrous mineral wollastonite takes care of the problem arising from use of high cellulose fiber in the formulations.<br>
The formulation for lightweight cementitious cellulose fiber reinforced building material is given below in Table 1.<br>
In another embodiment, the lightweight cementitious cellulose fiber reinforced building material is prepared by the Hatschek Process.<br>
The main advantage of the present invention is improved workability at an economical price, as well as improved dimensional stability without using low density additive.<br>
The problems of dimensional stability and moisture movement due to use of high cellulose fiber in the formulation has been overcome by using fibrous mineral wollastonite and Bauxite as part of the compositions. The problems related to high water<br>
 <br>
absorption has been overcome by treating the fibrous material with silicon so that water absorption by fibrous material is minimal.<br>
Finishing method also developed by providing Tongue and Groove to the edges of the product for better jointing process of between the boards and also to have continuity in the system during laying of boards.<br>
Further details of the present invention will be apparent from the examples presented below which are purely illustrative and are not limited to the particular embodiments illustrated herein.<br>

Example 2: Process for preparation<br>
Lightweight fibre cement building boards are manufactured by using Hatscheck process. Cellulose fibre is treated using Hydropulper and then further disc refiner to open up to 28-30 degree SR with a known consistency. After refining, the pulp slurry is transferred to main mixer. Cement is prepared in a cement mixer with known consistency of water. Flyash and quartz/silica is also prepared in separate tank. After taking cellulose into main mixer, cement, quartz and flyash are also added into the main mixer along with other additives. Further material is moved to agitator and then to vats in the machine through premixing arrangement. Further sheet formation will be as described in the hatschek process. After making the sheets of desired thicknesses, the sheets are cured in autoclaves at temperature 180-190 deg C with autoclaving pressure of 150 PSI. (6-7 bar) for about 8 hours. After curing sheets are removed and finished as per the market requirement.<br>
