				<td>COMPOSITIONS AND DEVICES<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of United States Patent Application Serial No. 61/027,429 filed February 8, 2008, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION <br>
[0002] Teeth whitening products are known in art, and include products and methods which are sold over the counter, or performed professionally. One bleaching device uses a tray which holds a bleaching composition and is then applied to the teeth. See e.g., US Patents 5,746,598 and 5,376,006, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. Another bleaching device is in the form of a strip which is applied to a tooth surface. See e.g., US Patent 5,891,453, 6,436,297, 5,879,691, 6,277,458, 5,894,071, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. Other bleaching devices are liquid tooth whitening gels as described in US Patent 6,669,930, US Publication 2005/0038181 and WO 2002/032961, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. While use of such devices may cause tooth whitening, they do not generally address treating the oral cavity for other indications. Indeed, such devices may also worsen some oral conditions. For example, people wearing such devices may tend to keep their mouths open, thereby causing increased evaporation of saliva resulting in dry mouth. <br>
[0003] While the use of such products may whiten teeth, there is a need to develop compositions which may simultaneously whiten teeth and treat the oral cavity, e.g., simultaneously reduce or inhibit formation of dental caries, reduce or inhibit demineralization and promote remineralization of the teeth, and/or treat dry mouth.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION <br>
[0004] The compositions of the present invention can promote or improve oral health and/or systemic health, including cardiovascular health, e.g., by reducing potential for systemic infection via the oral tissues.<br>
[0005] The present invention is directed to compositions and devices which deliver basic amino acids, e.g., arginine, to the oral cavity together with a whitening agent to whiten teeth, and, e.g., (i) reduce or inhibit formation of dental caries, (ii) reduce, repair or inhibit pre-carious lesions of the enamel, e.g., as detected by quantitative light-induced fluorescence (QLF) or electrical caries measurement (ECM), (iii) reduce or inhibit demineralization and promote remineralization of the teeth, (iv) reduce hypersensitivity of the teeth, (v) reduce or inhibit gingivitis, (vi) promote healing of sores or cuts in the mouth, (vii) reduce levels of acid producing bacteria, (viii) to increase relative levels of<br>
arginolytic bacteria, (ix) inhibit microbial biofilm formation in the oral cavity, (x) raise and/or maintain plaque pH at levels of at least pH 5.5 following sugar challenge, (xi) reduce plaque accumulation, (xii) clean the teeth and oral cavity, (xiii) immunize the teeth against cariogenic bacteria, (xiv) promote systemic health, including cardiovascular health, e.g., by reducing potential for systemic infection via the oral tissues, (xv) reduce erosion and/or (xv) treat, relieve or reduce dry mouth. Such compositions and devices may be used alone, or in conjunction with other basic amino acid containing compositions, e.g., dentifrice compositions to deliver a basic amino acid to the oral cavity. [0006] Arginine and other basic amino acids have been proposed for use in oral care and are believed to have significant benefits in combating cavity formation and tooth sensitivity. It is believed that basic amino acids in the oral cavity are metabolized by certain types of bacteria, e.g., S. sanguis which are not cariogenic and which compete with cariogenic bacteria such as S. mutans, for position on the teeth and in the oral cavity. The arginolytic bacteria can use arginine and other basic amino acids to produce ammonia, thereby raising the pH of their environment, while cariogenic bacteria metabolize sugar to produce lactic acid, which tends to lower the plaque pH and demineralize the teeth, ultimately leading to cavities. Basic amino acids, e.g., arginine, moreover promote remineralization of the teeth, helping to repair erosion, and plugging microtubules implicated in dentinal sensitivity. Many patients complain of hypersensitive teeth following bleaching treatments, possibly because the whitening chemicals irritate the nerve endings in the microtubules.<br>

[0011] Other embodiments of the present invention will be apparent to one of skill in the art.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0012] An "effective amount" is an amount that is sufficient to have a desired therapeutic or prophylactic effect in the oral cavity without undue adverse side effects such as irritation or allergic response.<br>
[0013] Unless otherwise indicated, as used herein, a basic amino acid includes a basic amino acid in free base or salt form.<br>
[0014] Dental whitening agents are known in the art, and include any material safe for use in the oral cavity which provides bleaching or stain removal. Suitable agents are peroxides, metal chlorites, perborates, percarbonates, peroxyacids, and combinations thereof. Suitable peroxide compounds include hydrogen peroxide, calcium peroxide, carbamide peroxide, and mixtures thereof. Suitable metal chlorites include calcium chlorite, barium chlorite, magnesium chlorite, sodium chlorite, and potassium chlorite. Suitable hydrogen peroxide sources include, e.g., urea peroxide or a peroxide salt or complex (e.g., such as peroxyphosphate, peroxycarbonate, perborate, peroxysilicate, or persulphate salts; for example calcium peroxyphosphate, sodium perborate, sodium carbonate peroxide, sodium peroxyphosphate, and potassium persulfate), or hydrogen peroxide polymer complexes such as hydrogen peroxide-polyvinyl pyrrolidone polymer complexes. Effective concentrations of dental whitening agents are also known in the art, as are effective treatment times.<br>
[0015] The basic amino acids which can be used in the compositions of the present the invention include not only naturally occurring basic amino acids, such as arginine, lysine, and histidine, but also any basic amino acids having a carboxyl group and an amino group in the molecule. Accordingly, basic amino acids include, but are not limited to, arginine, lysine, citrullene, ornithine, creatine, histidine, diaminobutanoic acid, diaminoproprionic acid, salts thereof or combinations thereof. In a particular embodiment, the basic amino acids are selected from arginine, citrullene, and ornithine, preferably, arginine, for example, 1-arginine.<br>
[0016] As used herein, reference to a basic amino acid also includes salts thereof. As the compositions and devices of the invention are intended for use in the mouth, salts for use in the present invention should be safe for such use, in the amounts and concentrations<br>
provided. Suitable salts include salts known in the art to be pharmaceutically acceptable salts are generally considered to be physiologically acceptable in the amounts and concentrations provided. Physiologically acceptable salts include those derived from pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic or organic acids or bases, for example acid addition salts formed by acids which form a physiological acceptable anion, e.g., hydrochloride or bromide salt, and base addition salts formed by bases which form a physiologically acceptable cation, for example those derived from alkali metals such as potassium and sodium or alkaline earth metals such as calcium and magnesium. Physiologically acceptable salts may be obtained using standard procedures known in the art, for example, by reacting a sufficiently basic compound such as an amine with a suitable acid affording a physiologically acceptable anion.<br>
[0017] The compositions of the present invention comprise an effective amount of a basic amino acid. Thus, the composition may comprise from about 1% to about 50% by weight of a basic amino acid, e.g., about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40 or 45%.<br>
[0018] The composition's of the present invention may optionally be suspended in a matrix. Suitable matrix materials are safe for use in the oral cavity, and do not readily dissolve in the oral cavity, and do not react with the dental whitening agent or basic amino acid.<br>
[0019] Matrix materials are known in the art, and are generally water swellable polymers, such as carboxypolymethylene, carboxymethyl cellulose, carboxypropyl cellulose, poloxamer, carrageenan, Veegum, carboxyvinyl polymers, polyvinylpyrrolidone, and natural gums such as gum karaya, xanthan gum, Guar gum, gum arabic, gum tragacanth, and mixtures thereof.<br>
[0020] One preferred matrix material is carboxypolymethylene. It has been previously determined that supersaturated carboxypolymethylene water compositions having a carboxypolyethylene concentration of from about 3.5% to about 12% have a high viscosity, and sustained release dental compositions may be prepared from it. As the compositions of the present invention may have non-aqueous or water insoluble components, the concentration of carboxypolymethylene may be higher, e.g., from about 15% to about 35%.<br>
[0021] Carboxypolymethylene may be available from various sources, including from B.F. Goodrich Company under the trade name CARBOPOL, such as CARBOPOL 934P and CARBOPOL 940.<br>
[0022] It has been found that carboxypolymethylene may be mixed with glycerine to enable<br>
large quantities of carboxypolymethylene to be dispersed in water. The amounts of glycerine in such compositions is known in the art, e.g., from about 20% to about 70% by weight. Glycerine may optionally be substituted with polypropylene, sorbitol, polyethylene glycols, or other polyols.<br>
[0023] The presence of carboxypolymethylene may lower the pH of the compositions of the present invention. To prevent low pH's which may erode dental enamel and to take advantage of the benefits of the basic amino acid, compositions of the present invention may have a pH in the range of from about 5 to 12, e.g., about 5.5 to about 6.5, e.g., about 6.1. The pH of the compositions may be adjusted with any base known in the art to be physiologically acceptable at the intended final concentrations, e.g., sodium hydroxide or triethanolamine, or with a basic amino acid or salt thereof.<br>
[0024] Another preferred matrix is polyvinylpyrrolidone, see US Pat No. 6,730,316, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference.<br>
[0025] Preferably, the basic amino acid and any other ingredients are evenly distributed in the matrix, even if such materials are insoluble in the matrix.<br>
[0026] The compositions of the present invention are suitable for directly applying to one or more teeth, e.g., as a thin film. The film is allowed to adhere to the tooth, and is maintained on the tooth surface for 1 to 30 minutes before falling or eroding off.<br>
[0027] The compositions of the present invention may be applied to one of more teeth by a delivery scaffold, such as a tray or a strip, both of which are known in the art.<br>
[0028] Where the delivery scaffold is a dental tray, the tray is configured to hold a quantity of any one of compositions of the present invention, e.g., from about .5 to about 5 ml. Dental trays are known in the art, as are their methods of manufacture. Generally, the dental tray is shaped to be able to fit in a wearer's mouth, and a channel adapted to fit over one or more teeth. Compositions of the present invention are generally dispensed into the channel, and then the dental tray is adhered to the teeth.<br>
[0029] Where the delivery scaffold is a strip, the tooth whitening compositions of the present invention may be applied or coated onto the strip. Such dental strips are known in the art, as are methods for their manufacture. Strips generally have a flexibility and stiffness which enables them to bend and conform to form a curved shape around one tooth or a plurality of adjacent teeth. The strip may also have shallow pockets to provide a reservoir of the bleaching composition. Generally, the viscous and adhesive nature of the beaching<br>
composition allows for the strip to be reversibly attached to one or adjacent teeth. However, the adhesiveness is low enough to allow the strip to be easily removed by the wearer by pulling off the strip of material.<br>
[0030] In one embodiment of the present invention, the compositions may optionally include an effective amount of fluoride, or a fluoride ion source, e.g., soluble fluoride salts. A wide variety of fluoride ion-yielding materials can be employed as sources of soluble fluoride in the present compositions. Examples of suitable fluoride ion-yielding materials are found in U.S. Pat. No. 3,535,421, to Briner et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 4,885,155, to Parran, Jr. et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 3,678,154, to Widder et al., incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0031] Representative fluoride ion sources include, but are not limited to, stannous fluoride, sodium fluoride, potassium fluoride, sodium monofluorophosphate, sodium fluorosilicate, ammonium fluorosilicate, amine fluoride, ammonium fluoride, and combinations thereof. In certain embodiments the fluoride ion source includes stannous fluoride, sodium fluoride, sodium monofluorophosphate as well as mixtures thereof.<br>
[0032] In certain embodiments, the oral care composition of the invention may also contain a source of fluoride ions or fluorine-providing ingredient in amounts sufficient to supply about 25 ppm to 25,000 ppm of fluoride ions, generally at least about 500 ppm, e.g., about 500 to about 2000 ppm, e.g., about 1000 to about 1600 ppm, e.g., about 1450 ppm. The appropriate level of fluoride will depend on the particular application. A mouthwash, for example, would typically have about 100 to about 250 ppm fluoride. A toothpaste for general consumer use would typically have about 1000 to about 1500 ppm, with pediatric toothpaste having somewhat less. A dentifrice or coating for professional application could have as much as 5,000 or even 25,000 ppm fluoride.<br>
[0033] Fluoride ion sources may be added to the compositions of the invention at a level of about 0.01 wt. % to about 10 wt. % in one embodiment or about 0.03 wt. % to about 5 wt. %, and in another embodiment about 0.1 wt. % to about 1 wt. % by weight of the composition in another embodiment.   Weights of fluoride salts to provide the appropriate level of fluoride ion will obviously vary based on the weight of the counter ion in the salt<br>
[0034] In another embodiment of the present invention, the compositions may optionally comprise an antiseptic, antimicrobial or antibacterial agent, the agent being selected from halogenated diphenyl ether (e.g. triclosan), herbal extracts and essential oils (e.g., rosemary extract, tea extract, magnolia extract, thymol, menthol, eucalyptol, geraniol, carvacrol, citral, hinokitol, catechol, methyl salicylate, epigallocatechin gallate, epigallocatechin, gallic acid,<br>
miswak extract, sea-buckthorn extract), bisguanide antiseptics (e.g., chlorhexidine, alexidine or octenidine), quaternary ammonium compounds (e.g., cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC), benzalkonium chloride, tetradecylpyridinium chloride (TPC), N-tetradecyI-4-ethylpyridinium chloride (TDEPC)), phenolic antiseptics, hexetidine, octenidine, sanguinarine, povidone iodine, delmopinol, salifluor, metal ions (e.g., zinc salts, for example, zinc citrate, stannous salts, copper salts, iron salts), sanguinarine, propolis and oxygenating agents (e.g., hydrogen peroxide, buffered sodium peroxyborate or peroxycarbonate), phthalic acid and its salts, monoperthalic acid and its salts and esters, ascorbyl stearate, oleoyl sarcosine, alkyl sulfate, dioctyl sulfosuccinate, salicylanilide, domiphen bromide, delmopinol, octapinol and other piperidino derivatives, nicin preparations, chlorite salts; and mixtures of any of the foregoing, to further aid in the beneficial effects of the basic amino acid.<br>
[0035] The compositions may further comprise an agent that interferes with or prevents bacterial attachment, e.g., solbrol or chitosan<br>
[0036] In another embodiment of the present invention, the compositions may optimally comprise anti-inflammatory agents, such as non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs.<br>
[0037] The compositions of the present invention may also include flavors. Flavoring agents which are used in the practice of the present invention include, but are not limited to, essential oils as well as various flavoring aldehydes, esters, alcohols, and similar materials. Examples of the essential oils include oils of spearmint, peppermint, wintergreen, sassafras, clove, sage, eucalyptus, .marjoram, cinnamon, lemon, lime, grapefruit, and orange. Also useful are such chemicals as menthol, carvone, and anethole. Useful flavorings may also include sweeteners, such as sucralose, aspartame, saccharine. The compositions of the present invention may also include colors.<br>
[0038] Enhancing oral health also provides benefits in systemic health, as the oral tissues can be gateways for systemic infections. Good oral health is associated with systemic health, including cardiovascular health. The compositions and methods of the invention provide particular benefits because basic amino acids, especially arginine, are sources of nitrogen which supply NO synthesis pathways and thus enhance microcirculation in the oral tissues. Providing a less acidic oral environment is also helpful in reducing gastric distress and creates an environment less favorable to Heliobacter, which is associated with gastric ulcers. Arginine in particular is required for high expression of specific immune cell receptors, for example T-cell receptors, so that arginine can enhance an effective immune<br>
response. The compositions and methods of the invention are thus useful to enhance systemic health, including cardiovascular health.<br>
[0039] As used throughout, ranges are used as shorthand for describing each and every value that is within the range. Any value within the range can be selected as the terminus of the range. In addition, all references cited herein are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties. In the event of a conflict in a definition in the present disclosure and that of a cited reference, the present disclosure controls. It is understood that when formulations are described, they may be described in terms of their ingredients, as is common in the art, notwithstanding that these ingredients may react with one another in the actual formulation as it is made, stored and used, and such products are intended to be covered by the formulations described.<br>
