Heat-stable diketopyrrolopyrrole pigment mixtures<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of heat-stable, tinctorially strong diketopyrrolopyrrole pigment mixtures and to their use in the colouring of organic material and in cosmetics, and also to novel diketopyrrolopyrrole pigment mixtures.<br>
The known pigments, especially those of relatively small particle size, which are distinguished by a relatively high tinctorial strength, are often not able fully to meet today's requirements especially in terms of fastness properties such as, for example, fastness to migration, to light, to weathering and to heat, for example in polyolefins. The same is also true of pigments for colour filter applications, where a high degree of transparency, or contrast, and good fastness to heat are required.<br>
The problem of the present invention was to make available heat-fast and tinctorially strong transparent pigments, especially in the form of pigment mixtures, which are distinguished by very good dispersibility and good warping behaviour, for example in partially crystalline plastics, and which can be produced by a simple and economically advantageous preparation process.<br>
It has now been found, surprisingly, that pigment mixtures having the above advantageous properties can be obtained using the inventive process described hereinbelow.<br>
The present Application accordingly relates to a process for the preparation of a mixture comprising at least two structurally different diketopyrrolopyrrole pigments of formula<br>
  (1),<br>
wherein<br>
A1 and A2 are each independently of the other an aromatic or heteroaromatic radical, by reacting a succinic acid ester with at least one unsubstituted or substituted aromatic or heteroaromatic nitrile, which process comprises carrying out the reaction in the presence of at least one compound of formula<br><br>

The phenyl radicals in the meanings of A, A, and A2 may be unsubstituted or, each indepen dently of the others, mono- or poly-substituted by halogen, e.g. chlorine or bromine, C1-C4al-<br><br><br><br>
the two substituents R2 are each independently of the other hydrogen, chlorine, bromine, methyl, tert-butyl, methoxy, -CF3 or -CN,<br>
and at least one diketopyrrolopyrrole pigment selected from the group consisting of structurally different diketopyrrolopyrrole pigments of formulae<br><br>
wherein<br>
R1 and R2 are as defined for formula (3),<br>
R6 is hydrogen, halogen, CrC4alkyl, methoxy, -CF3 or -CN,<br>
R7 is a linear or, from C3 upwards, optionally branched C1-C30alkyl, C6-C10aryl or C6-C24-<br>
aralkyl radical,<br>
X is -S-, -O-, -CR5R5'-, -COO-, -CONR5-, -SO-, SO2-, -SO2NR5- or -NR5-, and<br>

A further embodiment of the invention accordingly relates to a method of colouring organic material by mixing organic material and a tinctorially effective amount of a diketopyrrolopyrrole pigment mixture prepared in accordance with the invention or a diketopyrrolopyrrole pigment mixture according to the invention with one another.<br>
If desired, the products obtained in the preparation of the diketopyrrolopyrrole pigment mixtu res can be converted into a disperse form. This can be achieved in a manner known perse. Depending upon the compound and the intended use, it has proved advantageous to use the colorants as toners or in the form of preparations.<br>
Low molecular weight organic material may be, for example, mineral oil, lubricating grease or wax.<br>
High molecular weight material having a molecular weight (Mw) of from 104 to 108 g/mol may be, for example, synthetic and/or natural substances, for example natural resins or drying oils, rubber or casein, or modified natural substances, such as chlorinated rubber, oil-modi fied alkyd resins, viscose, or cellulose ethers or esters, such as ethylcellulose, cellulose ace tate, propionate or butyrate, cellulose acetobutyrate and nitrocellulose, but especially comp letely synthetic organic polymers (thermosetting plastics and thermoplastics), as can be ob tained by polymerisation, for example by polycondensation or polyaddition. The class of the<br><br>
polymers includes, for example, polyolefins, such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polyisobu-tylene, also substituted polyolefins, such as polymerisation products of monomers, such as vinyl chloride, vinyl acetate, styrene, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid esters, methacrylic acid esters, fluorinated polymerisation products, such as polyfluoroethylene or polytrifluorochloroethylene or a tetrafluoroethylene/hexafluoropropylene mixed polymerisation product, and also copoly-merisation products of the mentioned monomers. From the range of polyaddition and poly-condensation resins there may be used, for example, condensation products of formaldehy de with phenols, so-called phenoplasts, and condensation products of formaldehyde and urea or thiourea; also melamine, so-called aminoplasts; also the polyesters used as surface-coating resins, either saturated, such as alkyd resins, or unsaturated, such as maleic resins; also linear polyesters, polycarbonates, polyphenylene oxides or silicones, and silicone re sins. The high molecular weight organic material may also be a partially crystalline or amor phous plastics, such as LLDPE (linear low-density polyethylene).<br>
"Partially crystalline plastics" are to be understood as meaning plastics that on solidification form small crystalline nuclei or aggregates (for example spherulites or quadrites), including such materials that do this only in the presence of nucleating agents (for example organic pigments).<br>
Plastics may be thermoplastic high molecular weight organic materials having a molecular weight (Mw) of from 104 to 108 g/mol, preferably from 105 to 107 g/mol. Where the plastics are partially crystalline, they usually have a degree of crystallinity (Xc) of from 10 to 99.9 %, es pecially from 40 to 99 %, more especially from 80 to 99 %. Preferred partially crystalline plastics are homopolymers, block or random copolymers and terpolymers of ethylene, propy lene, butylene, styrene and/or divinylbenzene, especially a-olefins, such as HDPE (high-density polyethylene), LDPE (low-density polyethylene), polypropylene and polystyrene, as well as polyesters, such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and thermoplastic ionomers. Especially preferred partially crystalline plastics are polyolefins, especially polyethylene of high-density and polypropylene. The partially crystalline plastics may also optionally compri se customary amounts of additives, for example stabilisers, fluorescent whitening agents, fil lers and/or lubricants.<br>
The mentioned high molecular weight compounds may be present individually or in mixtures as plastic masses, melts or in the form of spinning solutions. They may also be in the form of their monomers or in the polymerised state in dissolved form as film formers or binders for<br><br>
surface-coatings or for printing inks, e.g. boiled linseed oil, nitrocellulose, alkyd resins, mela-mine resins and urea-formaldehyde resins or acrylic resins.<br>
The present invention relates also to the use of the diketopyrrolopyrrole pigment mixtures prepared in accordance with the invention or of the diketopyrrolopyrrole pigment mixtures according to the invention<br>

in the production of surface-coatings, for industrial or commercial use, for textile decoration and industrial labelling, for coil coatings or powder coatings or for automotive finishes, for high-solids (low-solvent), aqueous or metallic paints or for pigmented formulations for water-based paints, for mineral oils, lubricating greases or waxes,<br>
in the production of coloured plastics for coatings, fibres, plates or shaped substrates, in the production of non-impact-printing material for digital printing, for thermal wax transfer printing, ink-jet printing or for thermal transfer printing, and also in the production of polymeric colour particles, toners, dry copy toners, liquid copy toners or electrophotographic toners.<br>
The present invention relates also to inks comprising high molecular weight organic material and a tinctorially effective amount of the diketopyrrolopyrrole pigment mixture prepared in accordance with the invention or of the diketopyrrolopyrrole pigment mixture according to the invention.<br>
Methods of producing inks, especially for ink-jet printing, are generally known and are descrybed, for example, in US-A-5,106,412.<br>
The inks can be produced, for example, by blending the diketopyrrolopyrrole pigment mixtures prepared in accordance with the invention or the diketopyrrolopyrrole pigment mixtures according to the invention with polymeric dispersants.<br>
Blending of the diketopyrrolopyrrole pigment mixture prepared in accordance with the invention or of the diketopyrrolopyrrole pigment mixture according to the invention with the poly-<br><br>
meric dispersant is preferably carried out according to generally known methods of blending, such as stirring or mixing, the use of an intensive mixer (e.g. of the trade mark Ultra-TurraxÂ®) being especially recommended.<br>
When blending the diketopyrrolopyrrole pigment mixtures prepared in accordance with the invention or the diketopyrrolopyrrole pigment mixtures according to the invention with poly meric dispersants it is advantageous to use an organic solvent, especially a water-miscible organic polar, protic or aprotic solvent, e.g. an alcohol or ketone.<br>
The ratio by weight of the diketopyrrolopyrrole pigment mixture prepared in accordance with the invention or of the diketopyrrolopyrrole pigment mixture according to the invention relati ve to the ink is advantageously selected in the range from 0.0001 to 75 % by weight, espe cially from 0.001 to 50 % by weight, based on the total weight of the ink.<br>
The present invention accordingly relates also to a method of producing inks, which compri ses blending together high molecular weight organic material and a tinctorially effective amount of the diketopyrrolopyrrole pigment mixtures prepared in accordance with the inven tion or of the diketopyrrolopyrrole pigment mixtures according to the invention.<br>
The present invention relates also to colorants comprising high molecular weight organic ma terial and a tinctorially effective amount of a diketopyrrolopyrrole pigment mixture prepared in accordance with the invention or of a diketopyrrolopyrrole pigment mixture according to the invention.<br>
The present invention relates also to a method of producing colorants, which comprises blen ding together a high molecular weight organic material and a tinctorially effective amount of the diketopyrrolopyrrole pigment mixture prepared in accordance with the invention or of the diketopyrrolopyrrole pigment mixture according to the invention.<br>
The present invention relates also to coloured plastics or polymeric colour particles compri sing high molecular weight organic material and a tinctorially effective amount of the diketo pyrrolopyrrole pigment mixture prepared in accordance with the invention or of the diketopyr rolopyrrole pigment mixture according to the invention.<br><br>
The present invention relates also to a method of producing coloured plastics or polymeric colour particles, especially of producing mass-coloured plastics, which comprises blending together a high molecular weight organic material and a tinctorially effective amount of the diketopyrrolopyrrole pigment mixture prepared in accordance with the invention or of the di-ketopyrrolopyrrole pigment mixture according to the invention.<br>
Colouring the high molecular weight organic substances with the diketopyrrolopyrrole pig ment mixtures prepared in accordance with the invention or with the diketopyrrolopyrrole pig ment mixtures according to the invention is carried out, for example, by mixing such a colo rant, optionally in the form of a masterbatch, into the substrates using roll mills or mixing or grinding apparatuses, as a result of which the colorant is dissolved in the high molecular weight material or is finely distributed therein. The high molecular weight organic material comprising the admixed colorant is then processed by methods known perse, such as calen dering, compression moulding, extrusion, spread-coating, spinning, casting or by injection moulding, whereby the coloured material acquires its final shape. Admixture of the colorant can also be effected immediately prior to the actual processing step, for example by conti nuously feeding a pulverulent colorant according to the invention and, at the same time, a granulated high molecular weight organic material, and optionally also additional ingredients such as, for example, additives, directly into the intake zone of an extruder, where mixing takes place immediately before processing. Generally, however, it is preferable to mix the colorant into the high molecular weight organic material beforehand, since more uniform results can be achieved. In order to produce non-rigid mouldings or to reduce their brittle-ness, it is frequently desirable to incorporate so-called plasticisers into the high molecular weight compounds prior to shaping. There may be used as plasticisers, for example, esters of phosphoric acid, phthalic acid or sebacic acid. In the process according to the invention, the plasticisers can be incorporated into the polymers before or after the incorporation of the colorant. It is also possible, in order to achieve different colour shades, to add to the high molecular weight organic materials, in addition to the pigment mixtures or pigment composi tions according to the invention, constituents such as white, coloured or black pigments, in any desired amounts.<br>
A further embodiment of the present invention accordingly relates to a method of producing coloured, especially mass-coloured, plastics, especially partially crystalline plastics, by sha ping the diketopyrrolopyrrole pigment mixture prepared in accordance with the invention or<br><br>
the diketopyrrolopyrrole pigment mixture according to the invention together with the plastics in an injection-moulding method.<br>
The constituents of the injection-moulding formulation may be premixed before being fed into the injection-moulding machine, or they may alternatively be fed in individually at the same time. It is also possible to premix two or more components, and if desired also additives, and then to feed the mixture into the injection-moulding machine together with other components, which may be used individually or may likewise be premixed.<br>
A particular embodiment of the processes according to the invention relates to their being carried out in masterbatches.<br>
In a masterbatch the concentration of the diketopyrrolopyrrole pigment mixture prepared in accordance with the invention or of the diketopyrrolopyrrole pigment mixture according to the invention is preferably from 5 to 70 % by weight, based on the total weight of the diketopyrro lopyrrole pigment mixture prepared in accordance with the invention or diketopyrrolopyrrole pigment mixture according to the invention and the plastics.<br>
For the colouring of surface-coatings and printing inks, the high molecular weight organic materials and the diketopyrrolopyrrole pigment mixture prepared in accordance with the invention or the diketopyrrolopyrrole pigment mixture according to the invention are finely dispersed or dissolved, optionally together with additives, such as fillers, dyes, pigments, siccatives (drying agents) or plasticisers, in the same organic solvent or solvent mixture. It is also possible to use a procedure in which the individual components are dispersed or dis solved separately or in which a plurality thereof are dispersed or dissolved together, and only then all of the components combined. The processing is effected according to customary methods, for example by spraying, film-coating or one of the many printing methods, the sur face-coating or the printing ink advantageously being cured thermally or by irradiation, where appropriate after drying beforehand. When the high molecular weight material to be coloured is a surface-coating, it may be a customary surface-coating or a specialist surface-coating, for example an automotive finish.<br>
Preference is given to the colouring of thermoplastic plastics, especially in the form of fibres, as well as printing inks. Preferred high molecular weight organic materials suitable for colou ring in accordance with the invention are very generally polymers having a dielectric constant<br><br>
â‰¥2.5, especially polyesters, polycarbonate (PC), polystyrene (PS), polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), polyamide, polyethylene, polypropylene, styrene/acrylonitrile (SAN) and acrylonitri-le/butadiene/styrene (ABS). Especially preferred are polyesters, polycarbonate, polystyrene and PMMA. More especially preferred are polyesters, polycarbonate and PMMA, especially aromatic polyesters, which can be obtained by polycondensation of terephthalic acid, for example polyethylene terephthalate (PET) or polybutylene terephthalate (PBTP).<br>
Special preference is given also to the colouring of low molecular weight organic material, such as mineral oils, lubricating greases and waxes, using the diketopyrrobpyrrole pigment mixtures prepared in accordance with the invention or the diketopyrrolopyrrole pigment mix tures according to the invention.<br>
The present invention relates also to non-impact-printing material comprising high molecular weight organic material and a tinctorially effective amount of a diketopyrrolopyrrole pigment mixture prepared in accordance with the invention or of a diketopyrrolopyrrole pigment mixtu re according to the invention.<br>
The present invention relates also to a method of producing non-impact-printing material, which comprises blending together a high molecular weight organic material and a tinctorially effective amount of the diketopyrrolopyrrole pigment mixture prepared in accordance with the invention or of the diketopyrrolopyrrole pigment mixture according to the invention.<br>

The invention relates also to a method of modifying the spectrum of a beam of visible light by selective absorption of part of the radiation by means of a coloured medium, which compri ses using, as the coloured medium, a pigmented high molecular weight polymeric material according to the invention coated onto a transparent substrate.<br>
The present invention accordingly relates also to colour filters produced using the high mole cular weight polymeric material comprising at least one diketopyrrolopyrrole pigment mixture prepared in accordance with the invention or diketopyrrolopyrrole pigment mixture according to the invention.<br>
The production of colour filters by sequentially applying a red, blue and green pigment to a suitable substrate, e.g. amorphous silicon, is described in GB-A 2 182 165. The colour filters can be coated, for example, using inks, especially printing inks, which comprise a diketopyr rolopyrrole pigment mixture prepared in accordance with the invention or a diketopyrrolo pyrrole pigment mixture according to the invention or they can be produced, for example, by mixing a diketopyrrolopyrrole pigment mixture prepared in accordance with the invention or a diketopyrrolopyrrole pigment mixture according to the invention with chemically, thermally or photolytically structurable high molecular weight material. The rest of the production can be carried out, for example, analogously to EP-A 654 711 by means of application to a substra te, e.g. an LCD, followed by photostructuring and developing. A further document in which the production of colour filters is described is US-A-5,624,467.<br>
The colour filters according to the invention can be used with excellent results, especially in terms of transparency, transmittance and heat stability, in liquid crystal displays, plasma dis plays or electroluminescent displays, which may be, for example, active (twisted nematic) or passive (super-twisted nematic) ferroelectric displays or light-emitting diodes.<br>
A tinctorially effective amount of the diketopyrrolopyrrole pigment mixture prepared in accor dance with the invention or of the diketopyrrolopyrrole pigment mixture according to the in vention generally means, in the present invention, from 0.0001 to 99.99 % by weight, pre ferably from 0,001 to 50 % by weight, and especially from 0.01 to 50 % by weight, based on the total weight of the material to be coloured therewith.<br>
In particular it has been found that the diketopyrrolopyrrole pigment mixtures prepared in accordance with the invention and the diketopyrrolopyrrole pigment mixtures according to the<br><br>
invention, for example in thermoplastic or thermosetting plastic materials, fibres, surface-coatings or printing inks, are distinguished by a pure hue, high tinctorial strength, high satu ration and very high transparency, good fastness to migration, to rubbing, to light and to weathering, very good heat stability and also by good gloss.<br>
The diketopyrrolopyrrole pigment mixtures prepared in accordance with the invention or the diketopyrrolopyrrole pigment mixtures according to the invention can also be used in cosme tic preparations or compositions. The amount of diketopyrrolopyrrole pigment mixtures to be used will depend on the nature of the cosmetic preparations or compositions. Usually, from 0.0001 to 50 % by weight, preferably from 0.5 to 25 % by weight, based on the total weight of the cosmetic preparations or compositions, of the diketopyrrolopyrrole pigment mixtures pre pared in accordance with the invention or of the diketopyrrolopyrrole pigment mixtures accor ding to the invention will be used.<br>
It is also usual to use, in addition to the diketopyrrolopyrrole pigment mixtures prepared in accordance with the invention or the diketopyrrolopyrrole pigment mixtures according to the invention, other pigments, goniochromatic pigments and/or dyes which are customarily used in cosmetic preparations or compositions. Such inorganic or organic pigments and/or dyes are usually used in an amount of from 0 to 25 % by weight, preferably from 2 to 15 % by weight, based on the total weight of the cosmetic preparations or compositions. Examples of such inorganic pigments can include titanium, zirconium or cerium oxides, and also zinc, iron or chromium oxides or iron(lll) blue (ferric blue). Preferred organic pigments are, for examp le, the calcium, barium, zirconium or aluminium salts of acid dyes. If desired, the pigments can also be used in the form of surface-modified pigments, for example modified by perfluoroalkyl phosphate, methylpolysiloxanes, methyl hydrogen polysi-loxanes or chitosan. Suitable modified pigments are, for example, those described by B. G. Hays in Am. Inkmaker, (June, 1984) 28, (Oct., 1986) 13 and (Nov. 1990) 28. In addition, the pigments can also be used in the form of solid solutions, as are described in US-A-4,783,540 and US-A-4,810,304.<br>
Those optionally modified pigments are advantageously used in the form of pigment prepara tions, in which the pigment is already present in dispersed form. Suitable preparations are described, for example, in W. Herbst, K. Hunger: Industrielle organische Pigmente, VCH Verlagsgesellschaft 1995, pages 92 ff.<br><br>

Example 1:<br>
Preparation of octadecyl-thio-benzonitrile in accordance with the following reaction scheme:<br><br>
The reaction is carried out under an inert atmosphere in a 5-necked 750 ml sulfonating flask provided with a thermometer, a mechanical stirrer, a dropping funnel and a reflux condenser. 100.00 g (0.35 mol, 1.0 eq.) of 1-octadecanethiol are dissolved in 200 ml of dimethylacetami-de (DMA) at 30Â°C and added over 25 minutes to a white suspension of 48.18 g (0.35 mol, 1.0 eq.) of p-chlorobenzonitrile and 67.72 g (0.49 mol, 1.4 eq.) of finely ground potassium carbonate in 200 ml of dimethylacetamide. The reaction mixture is then heated to 135Â°C and stirred at that temperature for 4 hours. The temperature is then reduced to 80Â°C and the reaction mixture is stirred for 16 hours to complete the reaction. The reaction mixture is then discharged into 1600.0 g of water at room temperature. The white crystalline solid that precipitates out over one hour is filtered off and dried at 70Â°C and 200 mbar. There are obtained 122.6 g (90.4 % of theory) of the compound of formula<br>
  (52).<br>
The compound of formula (52) can.also be prepared starting from 4-mercaptobenzonitrile in analogy to a process published by S. Karlsson, A. Hallberg and S. Gronowitz in J. Organo-met Chem. 1992. 430,1, 53-60 or in analogy to a process published by W. H. Roark, B. D. Roth, A. Holmes, B. K. Trivedi, K. A. Kieft, A. D. Essenburg, B. R. Krause and R. L. Stanfield<br><br>

In a 750 ml sulfonating flask, 30.0 g (0.252 mol) of 4-hydroxybenzonitrile, 84.0 g (0.252 mol) of 1-bromooctadecane and 48.7 g (0.353 mol) of finely ground potassium carbonate are introduced into 200 ml of N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) under a nitrogen atmosphere and heated at 120Â°C, with stirring. After being stirred for 15 hours, the mixture is cooled to room temperature and poured into 2 litres of water, whereupon a light-beige solid precipitates out, which is filtered off and washed with water. After drying at 60Â°C and 150 mbar, there are obtained 90.8 g (97 % of theory) of a colourless crystalline solid of formula<br><br>
Example 2:<br>

  (100)<br><br><br>
The reaction is carried out under an inert atmosphere in a 5-necked 750 ml sulfonating flask provided with a thermometer, a mechanical stirrer, a dropping funnel and a reflux condenser. The protonation and conditioning step is carried out in a 5-necked 2.5 litre sulfonating flask provided with a thermometer, a mechanical stirrer and a reflux condenser. 24.8 g (1.08 mol, 4.0 eq.) of sodium are added to a solution of 400 ml of tert-amyl alcohol and a catalytic amount of Fe(lll)CI3 at 112Â°C. The sodium dissolves, with the formation of sodium tert-amylate and H2, over 40 minutes at 112Â°C. To the resulting solution there are then added 62.0 g (0.53 mol, 1.96 eq.) of p-tolunitrile and 4.2 g (0.01 mol, 0.04 eq.) of p-octa-decylthiobenzonitrile and then, over 5 hours at 105Â°C, 92.2 g (0.31 mol, 1.15 eq.) of succinic acid di-tert-amyl ester. The reaction mixture is stirred for a further 2 hours at 105Â°C and cooled to room temperature overnight. The reaction mixture is then added to a solution of 450 ml of water and 450 ml of methanol (at room temperature) over 15 minutes. The resulting mixture is heated to 32Â°C and stirred for 4.5 hours at that temperature. The red precipitate is filtered off, washed with 500 ml of methanol and 500 ml of water and dried at 80Â°C and 200 mbar. 75.2 g (about 87 % of theory) of a red mixture comprising the pigments of formulae (100) and (101) are obtained.<br>
Example 2B:<br>
A mixture of 24.83 g (1.08 mol) of sodium, a spatula tip of FeCI3 and 400 ml of tert-amyl alcohol is refluxed under a nitrogen atmosphere in a 750 ml sulfonating flask. To the resulting<br><br>
clear solution there are added 59.47 g (0.508 mol) of 4-tolunitrile and 12.56 g (0.0324 mol) of 4-octadecylthiobenzonitrile, with stirring. 97.7 ml (0.311 mol) of succinic acid di-tert-amyl ester are then added dropwise over 5 hours. After the addition is complete, the resulting dark-red suspension is stirred for a further 2 hours under reflux and then cooled to room temperature. The reaction mixture is then added to a mixture of 450 g of water/ice and 450 ml of methanol over a period of 45 minutes, during which the temperature does not rise above 20Â°C, and is then stirred under reflux at 83Â°C for 4.5 hours to complete the reaction. The pigment composition obtained in that manner is filtered off and washed with methanol and water. Drying overnight in vacuo at 80Â°C yields 77.7 g (82.5 % of theory) of a pigment mixture comprising the pigments of formulae (100) and (101), which in PVC results in a transparent red coloration.<br>
Examples 2C-2E:<br>
Examples 2C-2E are prepared in analogous manner to Example 1A except that the 4-octadecylthiobenzonitrile is replaced by the nitrites set out in the table below.<br><br><br><br>
The reaction is carried out under an inert atmosphere in a 5-necked 1.5 litre sulfonating flask provided with a thermometer, a mechanical stirrer, a dropping funnel and a reflux condenser. The protonation and conditioning step is carried out in a 5-necked 2.5 litre sulfonating flask provided with a thermometer, a mechanical stirrer and a reflux condenser. 24.8 g (1.08 mol, 4.0 eq.) of sodium are added to a solution of 170 ml of tert-amyl alcohol and a catalytic amount of Fe(lll)CI3 at 112Â°C. The sodium dissolves, with the formation of sodium tert-amylate and H2, over 40 minutes at 112Â°C. To the resulting solution there are then added 34.46 g (0.22 mol, 0.8 eq.) of p-(tert-butyl)-benzonitrile. Then 44.64 g (0.32 mol, 1.2 eq.) of p-chlorobenzonitrile, 8.4 g (0.02 mol, 0.08 eq.) of p-octadecylthio-benzonitrile and 59.12 g (0.30 mol) of succinic acid diisopropyl ester are dissolved in 100 ml of tert-amyl alcohol at 60Â°C and added over 3.3 hours to the reaction mixture. In the first hour of addition the internal temperature is maintained at 105Â°C but is then reduced to 95Â°C. A further 10.95 g (0.05 mol, 0.2 eq) of succinic acid diisopropyl ester are added over an hour and the reaction mixture is stirred at 95Â°C for a further hour and cooled to room temperature overnight. The reaction mixture is then introduced into a solution of 1062 g of water and 213 g of methanol (at room temperature) over 20 minutes. The resulting mixture is heated to 76Â°C and stirred at that temperature for 4 hours. The dark-red precipitate is then filtered off, washed with 5 litres of methanol and 5 litres of water and dried at 80Â°C and 200 mbar. 81.5 g (80 % of theory) of a mixture comprising the pigments of formulae (102) and (103) are obtained.<br>
Example 4:<br>
A mixture of 22.94 g (0.998 mol) of sodium and 199.6 g of tert-amyl alcohol is refluxed overnight at a temperature from 110 to 115Â°C. The resulting clear solution is stirred at 105Â°C and to that solution there is added, dropwise over 3 hours, a mixture of 66.21 g (0.481 mol) of<br><br>
p-chlorobenzonitrile, 12.01 g (0.031 mol) of p-octadecylbenzonitrile and 64.22 g (0.317 mol) of succinic acid diisopropyl ester dissolved in 121.93 g of tert-amyl alcohol; after the addition is complete, the reaction mixture is stirred for 4 hours.<br>
The reaction mixture is then cooled to 23Â°C and discharged into a mixture of 422 ml of water and 422 ml of methanol at a temperature of from 25 to 30Â°C; it is then heated to 78Â°C (reflux) and maintained at that temperature for 6 hours. After cooling to room temperature, the suspension formed is filtered off, washed with 1.5 litres of methanol and 2 litres of water and dried at 80Â°C in vacuo overnight.<br>
There are obtained 66 g (70 % of theory) of a red mixture comprising the pigments of formulae<br><br>
The reaction is carried out under an inert atmosphere in a 5-necked 1.5 litre sulfonating flask provided with a thermometer, a mechanical stirrer, a dropping funnel and a reflux condenser. The protonation and conditioning step is carried out in a 5-necked 2.5 litre sulfonating flask provided with a thermometer, a mechanical stirrer and a reflux condenser.<br><br>
22.96 g (1.0 mol) of sodium are added to a solution of 200 g of tert-amyl alcohol and a catalytic amount of Fe(lll)CI3 at 112Â°C. The sodium dissolves, with the formation of sodium tert-amylate and H2, over 60 minutes at 112Â°C. Then 66.21 g (0.48 mol) of p-chlorobenzonitrile, 5.95 g (0-016 mol) of p-octadecylthiobenzonitrile and 48.16 g (0.238 mol) of succinic acid diisopropyl ester (SAI) are dissolved in 121 g of tert-amyl alcohol at 90Â°C and added over 2 hours to the reaction mixture. In the first hour of addition the internal temperature is maintained at 112Â°C but is then reduced to 85Â°C. A further 16.06 g (0.08 mol) of SAI are then added over 3 hours and the reaction mixture is stirred at 85Â°C for a further 4 hours and cooled to room temperature. The reaction mixture is then transferred into a solution of 552 ml of water and 522 ml of methanol at room temperature over 20 minutes. The resulting mixture is heated to 50Â°C and stirred at that temperature for 4 hours. The dark-red precipitate is then filtered off, washed with 8 litres each of methanol and water and dried at 80Â°C and 200 mbar in a drying cabinet. 88.3 g (96 % of theory) of a red mixture comprising the pigments of formulae (103) and (104) are obtained, which in PVC results in a transparent red coloration.<br>
Example 4C is prepared in analogous manner except that octadecyloxy-benzonitrile is added to the sodium tert-amylate directly and not together with the p-chlorobenzonitrile and SAI.<br><br><br><br>
The reaction is carried out under an inert atmosphere in a 5-necked 1.5 litre sulfonating flask provided with a thermometer, a mechanical stirrer, a dropping funnel and a reflux condenser. The protonation and conditioning step is carried out in a 5-necked 2.5 litre sulfonating flask provided with a thermometer, a mechanical stirrer and a reflux condenser. 44.5 g (1.9 mol) of sodium are added to a solution of 348 g of tert-amyl alcohol and a catalytic amount of Fe(III)CI3 at 115Â°C. The sodium dissolves, with the formation of sodium tert-amylate and H2, over 40 minutes at 115Â°C. Then 137.6 g (1.0 mol) of p-chlorobenzonitrile, 12.3 g (32 mmol) of p-octadecylthiobenzonitrile and 94.2 g (0.46 mol) of succinic acid diiso-propyl ester (SAI) are dissolved in 220 g of tert-amyl alcohol at 60Â°C and added over 2 hours to the reaction solution. In the first hour of addition the internal temperature is maintained at 115Â°C but is then slowly reduced to 85Â°C. A further 31.0 g (0.15 mol) of SAI are then added over 3 hours. Over a further 3 hours, 160 g of an azeotropic mixture of isopropanol and tert-amyl alcohol are then distilled off under reduced pressure (350 mbar) at 85Â°C. The reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature and, over 2.5 hours, added to a mixture of 349 g of ice, 170 g of methanol and 163 g of 60 % sulfuric acid at 0Â°C. During the addition, there are added a further 231 g of MeOH and a total of 1440 g of ice in portions. The resulting mixture is stirred at 0Â°C for 5 hours. The dark-red precipitate is filtered off, washed with 5 litres each of methanol and water and dried at 80Â°C and 200 mbar in a drying cabinet. There are obtained 170 g (88 %) of a red mixture comprising the pigments of formulae (103) and (104), which in PVC results in a transparent red coloration.<br>
Using the appropriately substituted benzonitriles (Examples 4E-4G from the table below) instead of 4-octadecylthiobenzonitrile, further pigments are synthesised in the mentioned yields in analogous manner. Examples 4H and 4J are prepared in analogous manner except<br><br>
that the substituted benzonitrile is introduced into the sodium tert-amylate directly and not added together with the 4-chlorobenzonitrile and SAI.<br><br>
38.8 g (1.68 mol) of sodium cut into small pieces and a spatula tip of FeCI3 are introduced into 375 ml of tert-amyl alcohol in a 1 litre sulfonating flask and heated to reflux (bath temperature of 130Â°C). To the resulting clear solution there is then added a solution of 72.3 g (0.53 mol) of 3-chlorobenzonitrile, 31.0 g (0.23 mol) of 4-chlorobenzonitrile, 14.2 g (0.038 mol) of 4-octadecylthiobenzonitrile and also 92.9 ml (0.45 mol) of succinic acid diisopropyl ester (SAI) in 225 ml of tert-amyl alcohol via a heated dropping funnel over 3 hours, the bath tern-<br><br>
perature being set at 95Â°C at the beginning. After the addition is complete, a further 15.5 ml (0.075 mol) of SAI are added over 30 minutes. The reaction mixture is then cooled to 50Â°C and transferred to a mixture of 375 ml of methanol and 1125 ml of water at room temperature over 30 minutes. After the addition is complete, stirring is carried out overnight to complete the reaction. The orange suspension is filtered and washed with methanol and then with water. After drying overnight at 80Â°C and 200 mbar in a drying cabinet, there are obtained 136.9 g (91 % of theory) of a pigment which in PVC results in a transparent, tinctorially strong, orange coloration.<br><br>
25.9 g (1.13 mol) of sodium cut into small pieces and a spatula tip of FeCI3 are introduced into 250 ml of tert-amyl alcohol in a 1 litre sulfonating flask and heated to reflux (bath temperature of 130Â°C). Into the resulting clear solution there is then added a solution of 107.2 g (0.50 mol) of 4-phenylthiobenzonitrile, 2,1 g (0.005 mol) of 4-octadecylthiobenzonitrile and 73.43 g (0.36 mol) of succinic acid diisopropyl ester (SAI) in 100 ml of tert-amyl alcohol via a heated dropping funnel (90Â°C) over 3 hours. After the addition is complete, stirring is carried out at reflux for a further 1.5 hours. The reaction mixture is then cooled to room temperature and, over 30 minutes, transferred by means of a pump into a mixture of 1000 ml of water/ice, 200 ml of methanol and 90 g of glacial acetic acid at 0Â°C. After the addition is complete, stirring is carried out overnight at 0-10Â°C to complete the reaction. The red suspension is then filtered and washed with methanol and then with water. After drying overnight at 70Â°C and 200 mbar in a drying cabinet, there are obtained 106.3 g (87 % of theory) of a pigment which in PVC results in a transparent, tinctorially strong, red coloration.<br><br><br>
107.2 g (0.30 mol) of a commercially available form of C.I. Pigment Red 254 and 97.4 g (0.71 mol) of anhydrous finely ground potassium carbonate are introduced into 1 litre of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMA) in a 2.5 litre sulfonating flask and stirred vigorously under a nitrogen atmosphere at 70Â°C. A mixture of 65.8 g (0.585 mol) of thiophenol and 4.52 g (0.015 mol) of 1-octadecylthiol is then added dropwise via a dropping funnel. The mixture is then stirred at 130Â°C for 2.5 hours and subsequently stirred overnight at 110Â°C to complete the reaction. After cooling to room temperature, the mixture is slowly added to a mixture of 45 g of glacial acetic acid, 2.25 litres of methanol and 450 ml of water and, after addition is complete, is stirred for 2 hours. The red precipitate is filtered off and then washed successively with methanol and water. After drying overnight at 80Â°C and 200 mbar in a drying cabinet, 149.1 g (98.6 % of theory) of a red crude pigment of coarse particle size are obtained.<br>
Some of that crude pigment is reacted in accordance with following procedure in order further to optimise the particle form:<br>
5.0 g (0.22 mol) of sodium cut into small pieces and a spatula tip of FeCI3 are introduced into 200 ml of tert-amyl alcohol in a 750 ml sulfonating flask and, under a nitrogen atmosphere, heated to reflux (bath temperature of 130Â°C). To the resulting clear solution there are then added 25.2 g (about 0.05 mol) of the crude pigment in portions, with stirring. After addition is complete, stirring is carried out for a further 2 hours under reflux. The reaction mixture is then cooled to room temperature and, over 30 minutes, transferred by means of a pump into a mixture of 500 ml of water/ice, 100 ml of methanol and 18 g (0.3 mol) of glacial acetic acid at 0Â°C. After addition is complete, stirring is carried out at 0-10Â°C overnight to complete the reaction. The red suspension is then filtered and washed with methanol and then with water. After drying overnight at 70Â°C and 200 mbar in a drying cabinet, there are obtained 24.0 g<br><br>
(95.2 % of theory) of a pigment which in PVC results in a transparent, tinctorially strong, red coloration.<br><br>
Phase A is put into high shear mixer and mixed until colour are completely extended. All<br>
ingredients of phase B are put together and mixed until phase B is fully homogenous.<br>
Phase B is sprayed to phase A with high mixing.<br>
The united phases are mixed fully homogenous by a high shear mixer.<br>
There is obtained a powder foundation having excellent in-use properties and an intense<br>
bright red colour of outstanding fastness to light.<br>
Cosmetic Formulation 2: Lipstick Formulation<br><br><br><br>
Ingredients 8-21 are mixed at a temperature of 75-80Â°C until the phase is uniform. Ingredients 1-7 are mixed together and grinded in a ball mill or 3-roll mill. Afterwards ingredients 1-7 are added to the mixture of ingredients 8-21. The mixture is mixed at a temperature of 75-80Â°C. Afterwards ingredient 22 is added and the mixture is mixed at a temperature of about 70Â°C. A lipstick having excellent in-use properties is obtained in that manner.<br><br><br><br>
A red nail varnish having very good in-use properties and outstanding gloss is obtained. After application of the nail varnish, a waiting period of three days and removal of the nail varnish, it is found that the nail has remained completely unstained.<br><br></td>
