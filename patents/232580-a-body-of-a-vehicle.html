3.   PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br><br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a body of a vehicle, comprising: a main body formed of at least one longitudinal beam and a plurality of trans- verse beams, the beams being interconnected; a first floor provided on the side of an upper surface of the main body; a second floor provided on the side of a lower surface of the main body, at a predetermined vertical distance from the main body, the second floor being supported against the main body; at least two partition walls which are arranged transversely with respect to the longitudinal axis of the main body and which reside substantially vertically between the main body and the second floor at a distance from one another, the partition walls and the floors thus forming at least one free space below the main body.<br>
The bodies of vehicles, such as buses, typically comprise a main body formed of beams. Such a main body usually includes at least two longitudinal beams and a plurality of transverse beams. Above the main body resides the floor of a passenger compartment. Below the main body resides a luggage compartment which includes a second floor. The luggage compartment is divided into sections by means of a plurality of vertical partition walls.<br>
Nowadays the partition walls comprise a lattice structure formed of metal tubes, a sheet of plywood or the like being fastened thereto. It is laborious and expensive to manufacture such a partition wall. In addition, the structure is heavy.<br>
 BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the invention is to provide a novel and improved body of a vehicle. The body of a vehicle according to the invention is characterized in that the partition wall is a sheet like piece immovably fastened at least to a transverse beam of the main body, that the partition wall comprises a horizontal lower edge provided with a first support section transverse with respect to the plane surface of the partition wall, and in that the first support section is arranged to support the second floor. The idea underlying the invention is that the second floor which resides below the main body of the vehicle is supported against the main body by means of the partition walls. A partition wall is a sheet like piece whose lower edge is provided with a transverse support section arranged to support the second floor.<br><br><br>
An advantage of the invention is that the partition wall serves both as a space-dividing component and as a load-bearing component, which means that the body structure can be simpler and lighter. Furthermore, such a sheet like structure is quick to manufacture and it bears well vertical tensile stresses.<br>
The idea underlying an embodiment of the invention is that the partition wall is arranged to extend above the main body, and that an upper edge of the partition wall is provided with a second support section arranged to support the floor residing above the main body. Hence, both floors are sup- ported in a simple manner. The solution makes the body quicker to manufacture.<br>
The idea underlying an embodiment of the invention is that the partition wall is immovably fastened to a longitudinal beam and a trans- verse beam that are included in the main body, the partition wall being arranged to contribute to the fastening between the beams as well as to receive forces active between the beams. This makes the body extremely rigid and durable.<br>
The idea underlying an embodiment of the invention is that the support section is a bent section of a predetermined size provided in a horizontal edge of the partition wall. Such a bend is easy and quick to manufacture in modern sheet metal work machines. Furthermore, the support section and the rest of the partition wall constitute a uniform piece, which makes the structure highly durable against loads. The idea underlying an embodiment of the invention is that the partition wall is a piece manufactured from a metal sheet, dimensioned to extend as a uniform piece from a first side of the body all the way to a second side thereof. Hence, the partition wall forms a uniform support element between the sides of the vehicle and, further, between the main body and the second floor. The sheet like structure is highly capable of receiving a shear force in a direction parallel with the sheet, which effectively stiffens the body of the vehicle with respect to torsional stresses. The idea underlying an embodiment of the invention is that the partition wall comprises a plurality of openings which are dimensioned and arranged such that portions residing between the openings form a lattice-like structure. Such a structure is light and relatively easy and quick to manufacture e.g. by water jet cutting. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br><br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The body shown in Figure 1 comprises a main body 1 formed of longitudinal beams<br>
2 and transverse beams 3, which are interconnected. Typically, the number of<br>
longitudinal beams 2 is at least two, and the beams are arranged at a distance from<br>
one another. In some cases, one firm longitudinal beam may suffice. Typically, a<br>
plurality of transverse beams 3 is provided, and they may extend as a uniform piece<br>
from a first side 4 of the body to a second side 5 thereof. Ends of the transverse<br>
beams 3 may be pro- vided with vertical beams 6 to which sheets forming a side<br>
surface of a vehicle may be fastened. Screw joints or welded joints, for example, may<br>
be used between the beams 2, 3, 6. Furthermore, the material of the beams 2,3, 6 may<br>
be a suitable metal, such as steel or aluminium, and their cross-sectional pro- file<br><br><br>
may be selected case-specifically. For the sake of simplicity, the figure shows the beams 2,3, 6 as tubular beams of a rectangular cross-section.<br>
The side of an upper surface of the main body 1 is provided with a first floor 7, which may consist of one or more parts. Furthermore, the side of a lower surface of the main body 1 is provided with a second floor 8, which may also consist of one or more parts. The second floor 8 resides at a predetermined vertical distance from the main body 1 so that an open space 9 is provided between the second floor 8 and the main body 1, the space being shown in Figure 2. The open space 9 may be used e. g. as a luggage compartment. Furthermore, at least two vertical partition walls 10 are fastened to the main body 1 to define the space 9 between the second floor 8 and the main body 1 in a longitudinal direction of the body. A plurality of partition walls 10 may be provided such that the partition walls 10 divide the space 9 between the second floor 8 and the main body 1 into several separate departments. The partition wall 10 is a sheet like piece and it may be formed of a steel or an aluminium sheet. The partition wall 10 may be one uniform piece, so it is easy to manufacture in automated sheet metal work machines. The partition wall 10 may also be dimensioned such that it extends from the first side 4 of the body to the second side 5 thereof.<br>
A horizontal lower edge of the partition wall 10 is provided with at least one first support section 11 which forms a section transverse with respect to the surface of the sheet. This first support section 11 contributes to supporting the second floor 8. The second floor 8 may be arranged on the side of an upper surface of the support section 11 and fastened e. g. by a screw joint or a welded joint. Alternatively, the second floor 8 may be glued to the support section 11. Furthermore, the partition wall 10 may be vertically dimensioned such that over an edge section 12 between the side 4, 5 and the longitudinal beams 2 it extends to the height of an upper edge of the longitudinal beam 2 while over a middle section 13 between the longitudinal beams 2 it extends to the height of a lower edge of the longitudinal beams 2. At least at the edge sections 12, a horizontal upper edge of the partition wall 10 is pro- vided with a second support section 14. The first floor 7 may consist of a first and a second edge sections 7a and a middle section 7b there between. The edge sections 7a of the first<br><br><br>
floor may be supported against the second sup- port section 14 residing at the upper edge of the partition wall 10. The middle section 7b of the first floor may be supported against an upper surface of a transverse beam 3. Of course, it is possible to provide the partition wall 10 with a suitable support section also for the middle section 7b of the first floor, e. g. as shown in Figure 3. If the body is a body of a bus, rail traffic vehicle or the like, passenger compartment seats may be fastened to the edge sections 7a of the first floor and the middle section 7b of the floor may serve as an aisle in the passenger compartment.<br>
The support section 11,14 may be formed by bending a section of a predetermined size of the partition wall 10 into a section transverse with respect to the plane surface thereof. The support section 11, 14 is quickly bent e.g. in a sheet-bending press. Furthermore, the support section 11,14 formed by bending is an integral part of the rest of the structure of the partition wall 10, which is advantageous for the durability of the structure. In some cases, however, the support section 11,14 may be a separate piece fastened to the partition wall 10 e. g. by welding, glue or a screw joint. The support sections 11 and 14 may point to the same direction, as shown in the figures or, alternatively, they may point to opposite directions.<br>
As can be seen in Figure 1, the partition wall 10 may be arranged against a side of a transverse beam 3 and fastened by welding to a longitudinal beam 2 as well as to a transverse beam 3. Some welded seams are marked in bold line in Figure 1 for the sake of example. Alternatively, the partition wall 10 may be fastened to the main body 1 by means of screws or the like. An advantage of a screw joint is at least the fact that the joint is very durable against a fatiguing load. In addition, the screw joint is easy to open, if necessary.<br>
Plug welding 15 may also be applied to the joint between the partition wall 10 and the main body 1. For the joint, openings are cut into the partition wall 10 e. g. by means of water jet cutting to enable welding to the beams of the main body 1 to be carried out there through.<br>
Over the section above the transverse beam 3, the partition wall 10 may be fastened to a vertical beam 6 by a screw joint, and over the section below the transverse beam 3 to the vertical beam 6 by a welded joint.<br><br><br>
Such a solution is advantageous because it has been noticed that the fastening of an<br>
upper part of the partition wall is subjected to a fatiguing load, and the screw joint<br>
endures it well. The fastening of a lower part of the partition wall 10, in turn, is<br>
subjected to great shear forces that can be managed well by the welded joint.<br>
The floor 7,8 may be fastened to the support section 11,14 of the partition wall 10 e.g.<br>
by glue, welding, screws or rivets.  Furthermore, the second floor 8 may be<br>
supported by means of one or more longitudinal floor beams 16. Two floor beams 16<br>
may be arranged at a distance from one an- other. The number of floor beams 16, the<br>
cross-sectional profile and the material may be chosen case-specifically. The floor<br>
beams 16 may be tubular beams manufactured e.g. from aluminium or steel. The<br>
floor beams 16 may be supported against the main body 1 by vertical supporters. For<br>
the sake of clarity, Figures 1 and 2 show no such supporters.<br>
It can be seen in Figures 3 and 4 that the partition wall 10 may be a uniform piece cut<br>
from a sheet material which may be provided with support sections 11 and 14 by<br>
bending. The middle section 13 may also be provided with a support section 14<br>
against which the floor 7b of the aisle of the passenger compartment may be<br>
supported. The partition wall 10 may be manufactured from a metal sheet, such as a<br>
thin steel or aluminium sheet. The thickness of a partition wall 10 made from a metal<br>
sheet may be 1 to 6 mm. It may further be seen in Figure 3 that the partition wall 10<br>
may include a plurality of openings 17 where through the necessary tubes and wires<br>
can be arranged.<br>
It is simple and quick to manufacture such openings e.g. by means of water jet<br>
cutting.<br>
It is also possible to manufacture the partition wall 10 from a composite material.<br>
Consequently, the partition wall 10 may be made e.g. from reinforced plastic<br>
comprising at least one plastics material and at least one fibrous material.<br>
It can be seen in Figure 5 that sections 18, marked in broken lines, at which the<br>
partition wall 10 does not extend from the first side 4 to the second side 5 may have<br>
been removed from the lower part of the partition wall 10. These sections 18 enable<br>
long objects to be transported in the luggage compartment 9. Naturally, the sections<br>
18 may also be designed differently from that shown in Figure 5 for the sake of<br><br><br>
example. The vertical edges of the partition wall 10 according to Figure 5 further include third support sections 19 that are transverse sections with respect to the plane of the partition wall 10.<br>
The third support sections 19 may be manufactured by bending the sheet material of the partition wall 10, or they may be separate pieces fastened to the vertical edges of the partition wall 10. The partition wall 10 may be fastened to the vertical beams 6 by means of the third support sections 19. Figure 6 shows still another structure of a partition wall 10.<br>
The partition wall 10 may be provided with a plurality of openings 20 such that the openings 20 lighten the structure of the partition wall 10, forming a lattice- like structure. Thin intersections 21 reside between the openings 20. In order to form dimensionally accurate and high quality openings 20 to the relatively thin sheet like structure, e.g. water jet cutting may be used. Of course, thermal and mechanical cutting methods may also be applied. Furthermore, it is possible to form the openings 20 such that the edges of the openings 20 are pro- vided with edge sections 22 transverse with respect to the plane of the partition wall 10 to support the structure of the partition wall. Openings 20 equipped with an edge section 22 may be formed e.g. by means of a press tool.<br>
Figure 7 further shows an application wherein a partition wall 10 comprises a separate lower part 23 and an upper part 24. The lower part 23 is arranged on the side of the lower surface of a transverse beam 3 while the upper part 24 is arranged on the side of the upper surface of the transverse beam 3. The parts 23 and 24 may be fastened to the horizontal surface of the transverse beam 3 e.g. by a screw joint or welding. The upper edge of the part 23 may be provided with a support section 25 for fastening the transverse beam 3, and the lower edge of the part 23 may be provided with a support section 26 for supporting a second floor 8. The second floor 8 may be fastened on the side of the lower surface of the support section 26 as shown in Figure 7 or, alternatively, it may be fastened on the side of the upper surface of the support section 26 as shown in Figures 1 and 2. The upper edge of the upper part 24 of the partition wall 10 may be provided with a support part 27 to enable fastening<br><br><br>
to a first floor 7, and the lower edge of the upper part 24 may be pro- vided with a support section 28 to enable fastening to the transverse beam 3. The upper part 24 may consist of two separate pieces 24a and 24b, a middle section 13 residing there between.<br>
Figure 8 shows a construction wherein a partition wall 10 extends as a uniform piece from a luggage compartment 9 to a passenger compartment 29 located above longitudinal beams 2, thus forming at least a part of the partition wall of the passenger compartment. The partition wall 10 may thus extend from the side of the lower surface of a second floor 8 all the way to the ceiling of the passenger compartment 29. The partition wall 10 may be pro- vided with openings for the longitudinal beams 2, and it may be welded to a side of a transverse beam 3. For the sake of clarity, Figure 8 shows no first floor 7. An advantage of an integrated partition wall 10 is that it makes the process of manufacture quicker. In addition, the structure can be light but still be highly capable of receiving loads. Figure 9 shows a construction wherein a partition wall 10 forms at least a part of the structure of a mudguard 30. A vehicle comprises at least two axles 31, each comprising at least two wheels 32. The axles 31 may be supported against a main body 1. Two partition walls 10 may be placed at both sides of the axles 31 such that the partition walls 10 define a space around a wheel 32. If necessary, a separate arch like part 33 may be provided above the wheel 32. The arch-like part is not necessary but a first floor 7 may form a part of the mudguard 30. All in all, this construction simplifies the structure of the body and makes the process of manufacture quicker. In addition, the structure can be light. Another advantage is that mud and dirt easily fall away from a vertically arranged sheet structure with a smooth surface. No small spaces exist around the wheel 32 to gather dirt.<br>
The drawings and the related description are only intended to illustrate the idea of the invention. The details of the invention may vary within the scope of the claims.<br><br><br>
