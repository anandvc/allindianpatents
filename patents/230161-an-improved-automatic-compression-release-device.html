				<td>AUTOMATIC COMPRESSION RELEASE MECHANISM<br>
INCLUDING FEATURE TO PREVENT UNINTENTIONAL<br>
DISABLEMENT DURING ENGINE SHUTDOWN<br>
[0002]     The present invention relates to internal combustion engines and, more<br>
particularly, to automatic compression release mechanisms employed in internal<br>
combustion engines.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003]     Automatic compression release mechanisms are employed in internal<br>
combustion engines to provide for improved engine performance at a variety of<br>
engine speeds. Such mechanisms typically include a component which is actuated<br>
based upon engine speed, that varies an exterior surface characteristic of a cam<br>
lobe along which mating valve train components actuate exhaust and/or intake<br>
valves of the engine. When the engine is cranking, a protrusion is created on the<br>
cam lobe such that the exhaust valve opens slightly during the compression stroke of<br>
the engine. The reduced compression caused by this "low speed orientation"<br>
reduces the effort to start the engine. However, when engine speeds are higher,<br>
such as during normal operation or idling, the protrusion is eliminated such that the<br>
exhaust valve remains closed during the compression stroke of the engine. This<br>
"normal speed orientation" maximizes engine power.<br>
[0004]     Automatic compression release mechanisms of this type often employ a<br>
weight assembly that is rotatably affixed to a portion of the camshaft such as a cam<br>
gear. As the camshaft rotates, centrifugal forces acting on the weight cause the<br>
weight to move radially outwards, away from the camshaft axis. However, the<br>
weight is typically biased by a spring towards the camshaft so that when the engine<br>
is at low speeds, the weight is pulled ir ward toward the camshaft. Because the<br>
movement of the weight is dependent upon the rotational speed of the camshaft, the<br>
movement of the weight can be used to govern components associated with the cam<br>
lobe to produce the desired speed-dependent variation in cam lobe shape.<br><br>
Commonly these components include a contoured shaft having a recessed side and<br>
an unrecessed side, which is coupled to the weight. The contoured shaft is disposed<br>
in a notch formed in the surface of the cam lobe, and when the weight is disposed<br>
radially inwards at low engine speed, the unrecessed side of the contoured shaft<br>
extends outward beyond the exterior surface of the cam lobe producing a protrusion.<br>
When the weight is rotated outwarc s at higher engine speeds, the recessed side of<br>
the contoured shaft faces outward and the protrusion on the cam lobe is largely or<br>
entirely eliminated.<br>
[0005]     In many engines, it is desirable to employ an automatic compression<br>
release mechanism having as few components as possible, in order to simplify and<br>
consequently reduce the costs of the mechanism. This can be achieved to some<br>
extent by integrally forming as a single piece assembly the weight and the contoured<br>
shaft such that rotation of the weight directly causes rotation of the contoured shaft.<br>
For similar cost-related reasons, it often is desirable for engines to employ simply-<br>
formed and inexpensive components; throughout the cam shaft assembly. For<br>
example, the cam gear can be molded out of plastic or die cast as a single piece.<br>
Also, the cam lobe can be integrally formed as part of the cam gear, or at least<br>
fixedly attached to the cam gear.<br>
[0006]     When shutting down any engine, its rotation is slowed both by friction and<br>
by the work of the piston against gasues in the cylinder during the compression<br>
stroke. Ouring this shut down the contoured shaft rotates to the low speed<br>
orientation in which the protrusion is exposed on the cam surface. If at the final<br>
moments of rotation there is insufficient angular momentum to accomplish the<br>
compression event, however, the compressed gas will work against the piston to<br>
cause a small amount of reversed rotation. This small reversed rotation of the<br>
engine can cause the cam follower to bear against the recessed, or flat side of the<br>
contoured shaft and rotate it against the bias spring force to its normal speed<br>
orientation. The automatic compression release mechanism thus becomes disabled<br>
for the subsequent starting event, thus making it difficult to restart the engine due to<br>
the high compressive forces.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0007]     The present invention is an improvement to an automatic compression<br>
release mechanism which prevents it from becoming disabled during engine shut<br><br>
down. More specifically, the improvement is a step formed in the notch which<br>
rotatably supports the contoured shaft along the surface of the cam lobe. This step<br>
blocks or prevents, the contoured shaft from being rotated by the cam follower when<br>
the engine rotates in reverse direction during shut down.<br>
[0008]    In particular, the present invention relates to an improvement in an<br>
automatic compression release mechanism having a weight assembly for rotating a<br>
contoured shaft in a notch of a can lobe between a low speed orientation in which<br>
the contoured shaft presents a first surface that protrudes above a cam lobe surface<br>
and a normal speed orientation in which the contoured shaft presents a second<br>
surface that is substantially flush with the cam lobe surface. The improvement<br>
includes a step formed in the notch of the cam lobe which interacts with the<br>
contoured shaft to resist rotation of the contoured shaft from the low speed<br>
orientation to the normal speed orientation when the cam lobe moves in a first<br>
direction of rotation during engine shut down that is opposite a second direction of<br>
rotation of the cam lobe during normal engine operation.<br>
[0009]    The present invention additionally relates to a camshaft assembly that<br>
includes a cam lobe having a recess a cam gear coupled to the cam lobe, and an<br>
actuator assembly including a weight and a shaft coupled to one another. The<br>
actuator assembly is supported in relation to the cam lobe so that the shaft extends<br>
into the recess. The shaft of the actuator assembly is configured so that during tow<br>
speed rotation of the cam lobe a protuberance formed by a portion of the shaft<br>
extends out of the recess beyond a porimeter of the cam lobe, and during normal<br>
speed rotation of the cam lobe the protuberance is at least one of reduced and<br>
eliminated. Further, the recess includes two curved surfaces that are connected by<br>
a step surface, and the step surface restricts rotational movement of the shaft at<br>
least some of the time.<br>
[00101    The present invention further relates to a method of operating a camshaft<br>
assembly. The method includes decelerating a rotational speed of the camshaft<br>
assembly from a first speed to a second speed, where the camshaft assembly is<br>
rotating in a first rotational direction and, as the camshaft assembly is decelerating,<br>
rotating a shaft of an actuator assembly of the camshaft assembly within a recess of<br>
a cam lobe of the camshaft assembly, so that a protuberance appears on the cam<br>
lobe. The method additionally includes, receiving an axially extending edge of the<br>
shaft adjacent to an axially extending step formed in the recess, where in at least<br><br>
one operational situation the shaft is prevented from rotating in a manner that would<br>
cause the edge to pass by the step.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
[0025]     Referring to Figs. 1 and 2, a single cylinder, 4-stroke, internal combustion<br>
engine 100 includes a crankcase 110 and a blower housing 120, inside of which are<br>
a fan 130 and a flywheel 140. The engine 100 further includes a starter 150, a<br>
cylinder 160, a cylinder head 170 and a rocker arm cover 180. Attached to the<br>
cylinder head 170 are an air exhaust port 190 shown in Fig. 1 and an air intake port<br>
200 shown in Fig. 2. As is well known in the art, during operation of the engine 100,<br>
a piston 210 (see Fig. 7) moves back and forth within the cylinder 160 towards and<br>
away from the cylinder head 170. The movement of the piston 210 in turn causes<br>
rotation of a crankshaft 220 (see Fig. 7), as well as rotation of the fan 130 and the<br>
flywheel 140, which are coupled to the crankshaft. The rotation of the fan 130 cools<br>
the engine, and the rotation of the flywheel 140, causes a relatively constant<br>
rotational momentum to be maintained.<br>
[0026]     Referring specifically to Fig. 2, the engine 100 further includes an air filter<br>
230 coupled to the air intake port i:00, which filters the air required by the engine<br>
prior to the providing of the air to the cylinder head 170. The air provided to the air<br>
intake port 200 is communicated into the cylinder 160 by way of the cylinder head<br>
170, and exits the engine by flowing from the cylinder through the cylinder head and<br>
then out of the air exhaust port 190. The inflow and outflow of air into and out of the<br>
cylinder 160 by way of the cylinder head 170 is governed by an input (intake) valve<br>
240 and an output (exhaust) valve 250, respectively (see Fig. 8). Also as shown in<br>
Fig. 2, the engine 100 includes an oil filter 260 through which the oil for the engine<br>
100 is passed and filtered. Specifically, the oil filter 260 is coupled to the crankcase<br>
110 by way of incoming and outgoing lines 270,280, respectively, whereby<br>
pressurized oil is provided into the oil filter and then is returned from the oil filter to<br>
the crankcase.<br>
[0027]     Referring to Figs. 3 and 4, the engine 100 is shown with the blower<br>
housing 120 removed to expose a top 290 of the crankcase 110. With respect to<br>
Fig. 3, in which both the fan 130 and the flywheel 140 are also removed, a coil 300 is<br>
shown that generates an electric current based upon rotation of the fan 130 and/or<br>
the flywheel 140, which together operate as a magneto. Additionally, the top 290 of<br><br>
the crankcase 110 has a pair of iobes 310 that cover a pair of cam gears 320 (see<br>
Figs. 5 and 7-8). As shown in Fig. 4, the fan 130 and the flywheel 140 are above the<br>
top 290 of the crankcase 110. Additionally, Fig. 4 shows the engine 100 without the<br>
rocker arm cover 180, to more clearly reveal a pair of tubes 330 through which<br>
extend a pair of respective pushrods 340. The push rods 340 extend between a<br>
pair of respective rocker arms 350 and a pair of cams 360 (see Fig. 8) within the<br>
crankcase 110, as discussed further below.<br>
[0028]     Turning to Figs. 5 and 6, the engine 100 is shown with the top 290 of the<br>
crankcase 110 removed from a bottom 370 of the crankcase 110 to reveal an interior<br>
380 of the crankcase. Additionally in Figs. 5 and 6, the engine 100 is shown in cut-<br>
away to exclude portions of the engine that extend beyond the cylinder 160 such as<br>
the cylinder head 170. With respect to Fig. 6, the top 290 of the crankcase 110 is<br>
shown above the bottom 370 of the crankcase in an exploded view. In this<br>
embodiment, the bottom 370 includes not only a floor 390 of the crankcase, but also<br>
all four side walls 400 of the crankcase, while the top 290 only acts as the roof of the<br>
crankcase. The top 290 and bottom 370 are manufactured as two separate pieces<br>
such that, in order to open the crankcase 110, one physically removes the top from<br>
the bottom. Also, as shown in Fig. 5, the pair of gears 320 within the crankcase 110<br>
are integrally formed as part of, or at least supported by, respective camshafts 410,<br>
which in turn are supported by the bottom 370 of the crankcase 110.<br>
[0029]     Referring to Fig. 7, a top view of the engine 100 (with the top 290 of the<br>
crankcase 110 removed) is provided in which additional internal components of the<br>
engine are shown. In particular, Fig. 7 shows the piston 210 within the cylinder 160<br>
to be coupled to the crankshaft 220 by a connecting rod 420. The crankshaft 220 is<br>
in turn coupled to a rotating counterweight 430 and reciprocal weights 440, which<br>
balance the forces exerted upon the crankshaft 220 by the piston 210. The<br>
crankshaft 220 further is in contact with each of the gears 320, and thus<br>
communicates rotational motion to the gears. In the preferred embodiment, the<br>
camshafts 410 upon which the can gears 320 are supported are capable of<br>
communicating oil from the floor of the crankcase 110 upward to the gears 320. The<br>
incoming line 270 to the oil filter 260 is coupled to one of the camshafts 410 to<br>
receive oil, while the outgoing line 280 from the oil filter is coupled to the crankshaft<br>
220 to provide lubrication thereto. Fig. 7 further shows a spark plug 450 located on<br>
the cylinder head 170, which provides sparks during power strokes of the engine to<br><br>
cause combustion to occur within the cylinder 160. The electrical energy for the<br>
spark plug 450 is provided by the coil 300 (see Fig. 3).<br>
[0030]     Referring to Fig. 7 and Fig. 8, elements of a valve train 460 of the engine<br>
100 are shown. The valve train 460 includes cam gears 320 driven by camshafts<br>
410 and also includes the cam lobes 360 disposed underneath the respective gears<br>
320 and around respective camshafts 410. Cam follower arms 470 are rotatably<br>
mounted to the crankcase 110 and extend to rest upon the respective cam lobes<br>
360. The push rods 340 in turn rest upon the respective cam follower arms 470 and<br>
as the cam lobes 360 rotate, the push rods 340 are forced outward away from the<br>
respective camshafts 410 by the cam follower arms 470 as they follow the contour of<br>
their respective cam lobes 360. This causes the rocker arms 350 to rock or rotate,<br>
and consequently causes the respective valves 240 and 250 to open and close at<br>
the proper times during the engine cycle. A pair of springs 480,490 positioned<br>
between the cylinder head 170 and the rocker arms 350 apply a bias force to the<br>
rocker arms in a direction tending to close the valves 240,250. As a result of this<br>
bias force upon the rocker arms 350, the push rods 340 are also forced against the<br>
cam follower arms 470 and hence against the cam lobes 360.<br>
{0031]     The engine 100 is a vertical shaft engine capable of outputting 15-20<br>
horsepower for implementation in a variety of consumer lawn and garden machinery<br>
such as lawn mowers. In alternate embodiments, the engine 100 can also be<br>
implemented as a horizontal shaft engine, be designed to output greater or lesser<br>
amounts of power, and/or be implemented in a variety of other types of machines,<br>
e.g., snow-blowers. Further, in alternate embodiments, the particular arrangement of<br>
parts within the engine 100 can vary rrom those shown and discussed above. For<br>
example, in one alternate embodiment, the cam lobes 360 could be located above<br>
the gears 320 rather than underneath the gears.<br>
[0032]     As shown in Figs. 9 and 10, each cam gear 320 is disposed directly<br>
beneath the top cover 290 of the crankcase. A central hub 640 supports each cam<br>
gear 320 with respect to its respective cam shaft 410 for rotation about a vertical<br>
cam shaft axis 645. A web 649 extends radially outward from the hub 640 and<br>
supports a circular ring of gear teeth 700. The hub 640 and the ring of gear teeth<br>
700 form an annular-shaped recess on the top side of each cam gear 320.<br>
[0033]     As shown in Figs. 9 and 10, an automatic compression release (ACR)<br>
mechanism is mounted to each of the cam gears (or, in alternate embodiments, one<br><br>
of the cam gears) 320 and disposed in the respective recesses of the cam gears.<br>
The ACR mechanism associated with each cam gear includes an actuator assembly<br>
510 comprised of an arc-shaped weight 530 and an integrally formed contoured<br>
shaft 540. In one embodiment, the assembly 510 is formed of powdered metal,<br>
although it may also be molded from plastic or other materials, or it may be die cast.<br>
The assembly 510 is rotatably mounted to the cam gear 320 by extending the<br>
contoured shaft 540 into and through a hollow tube 550 formed through the cam<br>
gear web 649. The contoured shaft 540 rotates about an axis 647 that is parallel to<br>
the cam shaft axis 645.<br>
[0034]     The top end of the contoured shaft 540 is circular in contour and connects<br>
to one end of the weight 530. It extends downward through the tube 550 and into an<br>
, axially directed notch, or recess 580 formed in the cam lobe 360. The cam lobe 360<br>
is located beneath the cam gear 320 and the lower end of the contoured shaft 540 is<br>
shaped to form a flat recessed surface 620 in its cylindrical surface. This flat surface<br>
620 extends over the axial extent of the cam lobe recess 580 and the contoured<br>
shaft 540 has a "D-shaped" cross-section in the recess 580 as shown in Figs 11-13.<br>
[0035]     As shown best in Fig. 11, when the assembly 510 is rotated to a normal<br>
engine speed orientation, the flat surface 620 on the contoured shaft 540 faces<br>
radially outward and it is substantially flush with the outer surface of the cam lobe<br>
360. On the other hand, as shown in Fig. 12, when the assembly is rotated to a low<br>
engine speed orientation, the contoured shaft 540 is rotated within the recess 580<br>
such that a portion of its D-shaped surface protrudes above the surface of the cam<br>
lobe 360. It is this protuberance which pushes upward on the push rods 340 through<br>
the cam followers 470 to open the valves 240 and 250 at low engine speed and<br>
thereby facilitate easier starting.<br>
[0036]     Referring again to Figs. 9 and 10, the actuator assembly 510 is biased in<br>
its low engine speed orientation by a spring 600. One end of the spring 600 wraps<br>
around the weight 530 and its other end bears against a pin (not shown) formed on<br>
the cam gear 320. The spring action produced by two wraps around the top of the<br>
contoured shaft 540 biases the weight 530 against the hub 640. After the engine is<br>
started and engine speed builds, the rotation of the cam gear 320 causes the<br>
actuator assembly 510 to rotate about its axis 647 and move radially outward from<br>
the cam shaft axis 645 against the bias spring force to its normal engine speed<br>
orientation. This results from the centrifugal force produced by the rotating weight<br><br>
530 which swings the arcuate-shaped weight about the axis 647. When engine<br>
speed is reduced, this centrifugal force drops and the bias spring 600 rotates the<br>
assembly 510 back to its low engine speed orientation adjacent the hub 640.<br>
[0037]     Referring still to Figs.9 and 10, the actuator assembly 510 is retained in<br>
place by an annular-shaped spacer 654. The spacer 654 encircles the cam shaft<br>
410 and it fills the gap between the top of the actuator assembly 510 and the bottom<br>
surface of the crankcase cover 290. The actuator assembly 510 is thus axially<br>
retained by the spacer 654 from moving upward. It is trapped in the supporting tube<br>
550 and constrained to rotational movement between its two operating orientations.<br>
[0038]     Referring particularly to Figs. 11-14, an important aspect of the present<br>
invention is the shape of the axially directed recess 580 in the surface of the cam<br>
lobe 360. The recess 580 extent is axially a substantial distance and it forms a<br>
trough having two curved surfaces 582 and 583. Each curved surface 582 and 583<br>
is shaped to mate with the circular surface of the contoured shaft 540, however, they<br>
are offset from each other to form a step 584. As shown in Fig. 13, when the<br>
contoured shaft 540 is in its low engine speed orientation, one edge of its flat surface<br>
620 engages this step 584 and inhibits its rotation to the high speed orientation. This<br>
is particularly effective when the engine reverses direction at shut down, as indicated<br>
by arrow 588. The downward pressure of the cam follower 470 acting against the<br>
opposite edge of the flat surface 620 attempts to rotate the contoured shaft, but this<br>
same downward pressure keeps the contoured shaft 540 seated against the<br>
recessed surface 583 and keeps it from lifting over the step 584 and rotating to the<br>
normal speed orientation depicted in Fig. 11.<br>
[0039]     While the step 584 is effective in blocking rotation of the actuator assembly<br>
to the normal engine speed orientation during engine shut down, it does not hinder<br>
the transition to normal engine speed during engine start up. During start up the<br>
contoured shaft 540 engages the step 584 as shown in Fig. 12 and the protruding<br>
shaft 540 relieves compression to assist starting as described above. As engine<br>
speed builds, a torque is applied :o the contoured shaft 540 by the weight 530 which<br>
rotates the shaft 540 against the edge 584. In addition, the centrifugal force acting<br>
on the actuator assembly as a whole lifts the edge of the contoured shaft 540 over<br>
the step 584. To enable this to occur, the axial opening in the tube 550 (see Fig. 10)<br>
must be large enough to allow the contoured shaft 540 to align radially with both<br>
curved surfaces 582 and 583.<br><br>
[0040]     The interaction of the st€ p 584 in the cam lobe recess 580 and the edge<br>
formed on the contoured shaft 540 by the flat surface 620 thus use the very pressure<br>
produced by the cam follower 470 which is the cause of the problem during engine<br>
shut down to solve the problem. During engine start up, however, this pressure is<br>
not applied for a large portion of each revolution of the cam lobe 360 and normal<br>
operation of the automatic compression release mechanism is allowed to occur. The<br>
present invention thus uses the force which causes the shut down problem to solve<br>
the problem.<br>
[0041]     While the foregoing specification illustrates and describes the preferred<br>
embodiments of this invention, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited<br>
to the precise construction herein disclosed. The invention can be embodied in other<br>
specific forms without departing from the spirit or essential attributes of the invention.<br>
For example, the present invention is applicable generally to the modification of the<br>
exterior surface of cam lobes, whether relating to the exhaust valve, intake valve, or<br>
other valves of an engine. The present invention also extends to other aspects of<br>
the design of the present camshaft assembly. For example, another aspect of the<br>
invention is the above-described means for fastening a weight and contoured shaft<br>
actuator assembly to the cam gear, where the contoured shaft extends through an<br>
opening formed in the cam gear and into the aligned notch formed in the cam lobe,<br>
and where the weight is free to rotate the contoured shaft about an axis through this<br>
opening and is axially constrained therein by a spacer disposed around a cam gear<br>
hub and extending radially outward therefrom to intercede between the cover and<br>
the weight assembly. Accordingly, reference should be made to the following claims,<br>
