				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION :<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the manufacturing of enhanced<br>
heat transfer surfaces. More particularly, the present invention relates to a<br>
process for manufacturing of enhanced heat transfer surfaces which are<br>
galvannealed surfaces and have surface characteristics suitable for applications<br>
in the areas of heat exchange equipments having single-phase flow and phase-<br>
change processes such as boiling, condensation and evaporation among others.<br>
The invention further relates to a device for manufacturing enhanced heat<br>
transfer surfaces adaptable to heat exchange equipments.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
A smooth surface has very low values of surface roughness. Such a surface when<br>
used for heat transfer applications of both single and multiphase including<br>
phase-change (such as boiling, condensation, evaporation) provide heat transfer<br>
performance, which is inferior to the rough surfaces. In single-phase flow<br>
applications the roughness helps in creating turbulence, whereas in phase-<br>
change processes the rough surface primarily provides larger nucleation sites in<br>
addition to increase in surface area for heat transfer, which leads to a higher rate<br>
of heat transfer. In addition to increased surface area, the porous surface<br>
provides interconnecting channels or pathways for the liquid and vapour.<br>
At present, the galvannealing surfaces are commonly used for applications in<br>
automobile industry (Ref. US# 5,997,664 and USD# 6, 368,728) requiring<br>
excellent surface finish and they have very small surface roughness values in the<br>
order of 0.5 micro-meter. Finishes that are too rough lead to poor performance<br>
after painting on exposed panel applications, whereas excessive smoothness<br>
results in poor paint adhesion. The alloy formation may or may not be complete.<br>
When there is incomplete alloy formation, smooth zinc films are observed in the<br><br>
surface. So far, for enhanced heat transfer applications, the rough, porous<br>
surfaces have been prepared using different approaches other than<br>
galvannealing such as binding metal powders (sintered, brazed), flame sprayed<br>
metal particles on the surface, electroplating, metal particles gas-blasted and<br>
metallic plating of metal particles. (Ref. US# 3,384,154, GB# 1,355,833, US#<br>
4,064,914, US# 3,607,369, GB# 1,371,034 and US# 4,291,758).<br>
A porous boiling surface formed of thermally conductive particles integrally and<br>
thermally bonded together uses sintering, soldering, brazing or thermally<br>
bonding a layer of fine particles to the base heat transfer surface to form<br>
interconnected pores and labyrinth spaces. (US# 3384154, GB# 1355833, US#<br>
40649114). The alloy formation however is limited to the region of bonding in<br>
these metal particles to the base surface. The overall porous surface structure is<br>
therefore highly inhomogenous in its character, where the base of porous<br>
surface shows alloy formation and upper surface tends to reflect the original<br>
characteristic of the metal powders/particles.<br>
A temporary binder such as a plastic material is used (US# 3384154) to establish<br>
and maintain uniform coating on the base metal surface. The binder decomposes<br>
and vapourizes during the heating and sintering process. The slurry of metal<br>
powder and liquid plastic binder material is applied to the base metal by dipping<br>
or spraying. The resulting coating is air-dried and solvent is evaporated. The<br>
powder metal coating and the substrate are then heated to sinter the metal<br>
powder particles together and to the base metal. The coating is however<br>
inconvenient and difficult to apply requiring longer drying times and leads to<br>
wastage of materials. It also results in non-uniformly thick coating. More uniform<br>
coating with lower mass production coating costs is obtained (GB# 1355833) by<br>
first coating the metal substance with a liquid binder solution of a low volatile<br>
polymer diluted with a high volatility solvent material. Metal powder is<br>
uniformally applied to this wet binder layer in such a way that all metal powder is<br><br>
wetted and all the high volatility solvent component is evaporated. The low<br>
volatile solvent is evaporated by furnace heating in mildly reduced atmosphere.<br>
In the end, the product is heated to cause metal bonding of particles to each<br>
other and to the base metal surface. This approach requires less binder than the<br>
earlier. A fast and low-bonding temperature characteristic is provided through<br>
the application of a loose coating of copper or steel powder matrix, bonding<br>
metal alloy consisting of copper and phosphorous or copper and antimony and a<br>
liquid binder and heating to braze the bonding metal alloy to the base metal and<br>
matrix (US# 4064914). The most important requirement of this process however<br>
is that the gas environment during the final heating step must be non-oxidizing.<br>
Any presence of oxide coating on the bonding metal alloy requires reducing gas<br>
i.e., hydrogen-containing, in order to remove oxide. Additionally, high<br>
temperature heating leads to grain size increase thus reducing the strength, the<br>
variations however are dependent on the type of bonding i.e. sintering or<br>
brazing.<br>
Accurate control of physical structure is possible with flame spraying (GB#<br>
1388733). In this approach, particles of metallic primary material are uniformly<br>
mixed with particles of a secondary material. This mixture is flame-sprayed on<br>
the metal substrate. A molecularly bonded, inhomogeneous layer of the primary<br>
material containing regions of secondary material, which is neither alloyed with<br>
nor interdiffused with the primary material is formed. Lastly, the secondary<br>
material from the regions of pure secondary material is eliminated, which<br>
provides a porous continuously bonded primary material layer bonded to the<br>
base surface. The accurate control is achieved by controlling the temperature<br>
and dimensions of the flame. An alternate approach provides melt-blasting of<br>
metal particles to form a porous layer having labyrinth spaces. The particles are<br>
heated to a temperature at which the surface begins to melt and then are<br>
blasted at high speed to the surface of the base material by gas pressure. This is<br>
however not possible with a smooth surface on which the particles cannot be<br><br>
melt-bonded. A rough surface is therefore necessary and an advanced surface<br>
preparation by sand-blasting is suggested (US# 4371034).<br>
For known enhanced heat transfer applications galvannealed surfaces are<br>
produced primarily with zeta and delta phases with complete alloy formation,<br>
which provide porous surfaces having pits, cavities. The surface roughness is<br>
much higher than that of the galvannealed surfaces for other applications, two<br>
examples for which are listed below.<br>
1.	As disclosed in US Patent Number 6982012 for the manufacturing of<br>
steel sheet suitable for use in parts such as automotive panels that<br>
require a good external appearance, good workability and good shape<br>
accuracy i.e. shape retention has surface roughness preferably of at<br>
most 1.2 urn and more preferably of at most 1.0 urn.<br>
2.	As disclosed in US Patent Number 53245942 for manufacturing of<br>
galvannealed steel sheet suitable for use as an anti-corrosive steel<br>
sheet for automobiles and which exhibits an excellent press formability<br>
has three-dimensional average surface roughness between 0.7 urn and<br>
1.4 urn.<br>
One of the approaches to form an alloy surface for steel adaptable for<br>
applications other than the areas of heat exchangers, is galvannealing. The steel<br>
strip is initially passed through hot-dip galvanizing process. This is typically<br>
carried out above the melting temperature of zinc. Galvannealing is carried out<br>
by heating the zinc coated strip in a furnace and holding it for some time for the<br>
desired composition of Fe-Zn alloy and surface characteristics.<br>
According to one approach, the HR strip (plain/smooth or profiled/rough)<br>
profiling is carried out using any or the combinations of the processes such as<br>
embossing, stamping, pressing and machining among others) which is thereafter<br>
cleaned and galvannealed.<br><br>
Cleaning of the strip or plate may take place during cooling in HSM itself. The<br>
"Tandem Mill" operation is decided by the profile requirements and the controlled<br>
surface roughness (with an workable range of roughness values), which provide<br>
enhanced performances in heat transfer applications for example in boiling heat<br>
transfer (Thome, 1990). Earlier studies (Ortiz and Rangarajan, 1998; Fossen, et<br>
al., 19980 have shown that the galvannealed surface roughness increase with<br>
rougher incoming cold rolled strips. Galvannealing process additionally enhances<br>
the surface roughness (Bensiger, et al., 1996). As mentioned earlier the porous<br>
surface can further be processed for required surfaces before a tubular shape is<br>
produced. Usually, the strip is edge slitted and is progressively bent into a<br>
tubular form with close control on dimensions. Welding is the carried out and<br>
processes of bead trimming and finishing afterwards.<br>
However, when porous surfaces are formed with galvannealing, which essentially<br>
creates Zn-Fe alloy coating through the process of heat treatment of zinc coated<br>
steel, the alloy formation is throughout the porous surface. The porous surface<br>
structure is rough and irregular with cavities or pits and having undulating<br>
surface. Such products obviously cannot be used for applications in the areas of<br>
heat exchangers, which warrant enhanced heat transfer surfaces having at least<br>
an alloy with porous characteristics.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTIONS:<br>
It is therefore an object of the invention to propose a process for manufacturing<br>
products with enhanced heat transfer surfaces which are adaptable in heat<br>
transfer applications for example, boiling, condensation and evaporation, among<br>
others (heat transfer applications as discussed above).<br><br>
Another object of the invention is to propose a process for manufacturing<br>
products with enhanced heat transfer surfaces, which may have different cross-<br>
sections with controlled roughness on one or both sides.<br>
A further object of the invention is to propose a process for	manufacturing<br>
products with enhanced heat transfer surfaces, which in	the form of<br>
galvannealed steel strips or plates can be directly used in heat transfer<br>
applications.<br>
A still further object of the invention is to propose a device for carrying out the<br>
process of the invention.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:<br>
As described in the background of the invention, present invention uses<br>
galvannealing approach for manufacturing enhanced heat transfer surface(s),<br>
which provides advantage of having an alloy with porous characteristics. The<br>
loosely binded metal particles through various processes described (in the<br>
background of invention) do not provide this advantage (obtained using<br>
galvannealing approach) of controlling the alloy composition with suitable surface<br>
roughness characteristics. Additionally, corrosion resistance is provided by zinc,<br>
the strength of which can be manipulated through its concentration and the<br>
thickness resulting from the steps of galvannealing. Moreover, the surface<br>
preparation separately for galvannealing is not really required. The final surface<br>
roughness is essentially dependent on the surface to be galvannealed. The strip<br>
surface profiles or patterns can however be made before galvannealing for the<br>
end objectives of the enhanced heat transfer surface. Such a prior preparation of<br>
surface profiles will produce compound enhancements such as porous fins or<br>
porous corrugated surfaces. Once galvannealed, the enhanced heat transfer<br><br>
surface can further be processed to arrive at the accurate profiles and patterns<br>
of the steel strips.<br>
When specific profiles or patterns (rough/enhanced - surface modifications) are<br>
made before galvannealing, compound enhancements such as porous fins or<br>
porous corrugated surfaces can be produced. HR strips for such types of<br>
enhancements can be galvannealed to obtain heat transfer surfaces of both strip<br>
or plate and tubular shapes. The tubular surfaces (non-enhanced type, not Zn<br>
coated) once formed can also be processed through the galvannealing approach<br>
to obtain the porous surfaces. These porous surfaces may have compound<br>
enhancement(s) of the type(s) mentioned above and others providing improved<br>
heat transfer. Moreover, the HR strips can have undulations (deformations),<br>
which themselves can be used as enhancement structures for heat transfer<br>
applications and similar to plain/smooth surfaces after galvannealing can be used<br>
for enhanced hear transfer applications having rough, porous surfaces of Fe-Zn<br>
alloy.<br>
As an enhanced heat transfer surface, the product of this invention finds<br>
applications for the basic modes of heat transfer viz., conduction, convention and<br>
radiation heat transfer and the applications involving a heat transfer mode or<br>
combinations of more that one heat transfer modes in single-phase flows and<br>
multi-phase including phase-change processes. The plate or strip forms (of any<br>
shape, size, thickness and curvature) having deformed or undeformed surfaces<br>
and tubular forms (of any size wall thickness and cross-section, including both<br>
ends sealed as in heat pipes) of this enhanced heat transfer surface with or<br>
without patterns or profiles delivering single or compound enhancements (the<br>
product of this invention) can be used (for example as plates, strips, tubes and<br>
fins, among others) in various heat exchange equipments that are both compact<br>
and non-compact. The increase in effective heat transfer coefficient, essentially<br>
delivers higher performance and compact design.<br><br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Fig 1	Shows an exemplary device according to the invention for<br>
providing an enhanced heat transfer surface by<br>
galvannealing.<br>
Fig 2	Is a flow-chart depicting the process steps according to the<br>
invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
As shown in fig 1, a Zinc pot (1)contains molten zinc. A steel strip (2) is caused<br>
to pass through the zinc pot (1) and is directed vertically upwardly. Above the<br>
zinc pot (1) and on both sides of the steel strip (2) are placed a plurality of air<br>
knives (3), which serve to remove the excess molten zinc from the steel strip (2).<br>
The steel strip (2) is again made to pass through a galvannealing unit (4), where<br>
the steel strip (2) gets heated to a temperature sufficient to enable a zinc and<br>
iron alloy to form. The desired phases and the surface characteristic is<br>
maintained according to the invention.<br>
The major difference with the galvannealing of steel surfaces other than<br>
manufacturing heat transfer surfaces lies with the temperature and time. A lower<br>
to medium range in temperature (440°C - 575°C) and time 3 s - 25 s) is<br>
employed for enhanced heat transfer applications products manufacturing.<br><br><br><br>
The galvannealed steel strip is processed further for final finishing.<br>
As shown in fig 2, the steel strip (2) is passed through a zinc pot (1).<br>
The temperature of the zinc pot (1) is maintained above 420°C.<br>
The zinc coated steel strip (2) is taken out of the zinc pot (1).<br>
The zinc coated steel strip (2) is arranged to move through the air knives (3),<br>
where the strip (2) is wiped out for any additional coating.<br>
Galvannealing is then employed in an galvannealing unit (4) for further<br>
processing of the zinc coated steel strip (2).<br>
The gavannealing is carried out between the temperature range of 420°C to<br>
600°C. The galvannealed steel strip (2) is then further processed for finishing.<br>
Surface roughness characterization is carried out for required porous surface for<br>
enhanced heat transfer applications.<br>
The process time for a maximum thickness of the steel strip including the<br>
immersion time is upto two hours. The process is applicable for any metal<br>
particle site with any porosity. The surface roughness can be achieved between<br>
100 µm - 200 µm. The alloying metal used is zinc including corrosion resistance<br><br>
element. For the step of galvannealing, the temperature is maintained between<br>
400°C to 575°C with a time between 3 s to 25 s.<br><br>

As described in the background of the invention, present invention uses galvannealing approach for manufacturing enhanced heat transfer surface(s), which provides advantage of having an alloy with porous characteristics. The loosely binded metal particles through various processes described (in the background of invention) do not provide this advantage (obtained using<br>
galvannealing approach) of controlling the alloy composition with suitable surface roughness characteristics. Additionally, corrosion resistance is provided by zinc, the strength of which can be manipulated through its concentration and the thickness resulting from the steps of galvannealing. Moreover, the surface<br>
preparation separately for galvannealing is not really required. The final surface roughness is essentially dependent on the surface to be galvannealed. The strip surface profiles or patterns can however be made before galvannealing for the end objectives of the enhanced heat transfer surface. Such a prior preparation of surface profiles will produce compound enhancements such as porous fins or<br>
porous corrugated surfaces. Once galvannealed, the enhanced heat transfer surface can further be processed to arrive at the accurate profiles and patterns of the steel strips.<br>
When specific profiles or patterns (rough/enhanced - surface modifications) are<br>
made before galvannealing, compound enhancements such as porous fins or<br>
porous corrugated surfaces can be produced. HR strips for such types of<br>
enhancements can be galvannealed to obtain heat transfer surfaces of both strip<br>
or plate and tubular shapes. The tubular surfaces (non-enhanced type, not Zn<br>
coated) once formed can also be processed through the galvannealing approach<br>
to obtain the porous surfaces. These porous surfaces may have compound<br>
enhancement(s) of the type(s) mentioned above and others providing improved<br>
heat transfer. Moreover, the HR strips can have undulations (deformations),<br>
which themselves can be used as enhancement structures for heat transfer<br>
applications and similar to plain/smooth surfaces after galvannealing can be used<br>
for enhanced hear transfer applications having rough, porous surfaces of Fe-Zn<br>
alloy. As an enhanced heat transfer surface, the product of this invention finds<br>
applications for the basic modes of heat transfer viz., conduction, convention and<br>
radiation heat transfer and the applications involving a heat transfer mode or<br>
combinations of more that one heat transfer modes in single-phase flows and<br>
multi-phase including phase-change processes. The plate or strip forms (of any<br>
shape, size, thickness and curvature) having deformed or undeformed surfaces<br>
and tubular forms (of any size wall thickness and cross-section, including both<br>
ends sealed as in heat pipes) of this enhanced heat transfer surface with or<br>
without patterns or profiles delivering single or compound enhancements (the<br>
product of this invention) can be used (for example as plates, strips, tubes and<br>
fins, among others) in various heat exchange equipments that are both compact<br>
and non-compact. The increase in effective heat transfer coefficient, essentially<br>
delivers higher performance and compact design.</td>
