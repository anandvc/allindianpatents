COSMETIC TOOL FOR LASH;<br>
I, TAHARA, TENSEN, A JAPANESE NATIONAL OF 3-8-201, TABATA-SHINMACHI 3-CHOME, KITA-KU, TOKYO 114-0012, JAPAN.<br>
THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br><br>
Technical Field <br>
The present invention relates to a cosmetic tool for lash, further specifically to the cosmetic tool for lash capable of curling lash concurrently with the painting of eyeblack.<br>
Background Art<br>
Conventionally, this kind of a cosmetic tool is usually formed by an eyeblack storage container and a paint brush fitted to the inner side of a cap of this storage container (for example see JP2002-85149A).<br>
Also, a conventional lush curler includes such a kind of a lush curler in which a first lever and a second lever are connected in the form of scissors, and a plate-like upper clamping-pressure body is vertically fitted to the tip part of the first lever and a lower clamping-pressure body having an elastic body is fitted to the tip part of the second lever (for example, see JP10-295433A).<br>
The lush curler thus given functions to curl lush by clamping the lush between an upper clamping-pressure body and a lower clamping-pressure body in the state of the lower clamping-pressure body being pushed upward by operating the tip ends of the first and second lever like<br>
1.<br><br>
scissors with fingers to close the tip ends thereof with the front face of the upper clamping-pressure body put on <br>
an eyelid.<br>
Conventionally, when painting the eyeblack on a lush, as described above, it was usually the case that with a cap of the eyeblack storage container held with fingers, the paint brush fitted to the inside thereof is used. When curling the lush, it was usually the case that the lush curler described in JP10-29.5433A has been used.<br>
Conventionally, when cosmeticizing the lush, it is necessary to curl the lush first and then paint the eyeblack thereto. Therefore, according to the existing tool, there has remained a problem that it takes a lot of labor to cosmeticize the lush. In addition, when the conventional cosmetic tool for lush is used, it is difficult to paint the eyeblack on the inner corner of an eye and the outer corner of an eye.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention <br>
     In view of the above-described circumstances, the present invention is proposed.<br>
Accordingly, it is technical problems in the present invention to provide a cosmetic tool for lush capable of curling lash concurrently with painting an eyeblack on the lash in every detail, and thereby, reducing labor for cosmeticizing the lash.<br>
In order to solve the problems, the present invention<br>
3<br><br>
takes several technical means as follows.<br>
The present invention is characterized in, as shown <br>
in Fig.l, that a pair of operation levers 2 and 3 forming operation parts 1 at one end sides thereof for applying fingers thereto are formed in the form of scissors/trowel by pivotally mounting these levers 2 and 3 at a body part, meanwhile, that the other end side 2a of one operation lever 2 inserted into an eyeblack storage container 5 is formed into a paint brush manner( claim 1).<br>
In this case, hair 3b for painting an eyeblack 6 on lash 7 in association with hair 2b at the other end side 2a of the one operation lever 2 is desirably fitted to the other end side 3a of the other operation lever 3(claim 2).<br>
Because, according to the above aspect, it is possible to paint evenly the eyeblack 6 on the whole part of the lash 7, thus preventing an uneven painting.<br>
In the present invention, preferably hair 2b is spirally fitted to the other end side 2a of the one operation lever 2, and hair 3b of the other operation lever 3 is positioned, so that hair end thereof is inserted into a spiral hairless portion 2c of the one operation lever 2 (claim 3).<br>
Because, according to the above aspect, the eyeblack 6 is granulated by the hair 3b of the other operation lever 3, thus preventing the eyeblack 6 from being painted in a state of a large drop.<br>
In addition, in the present invention, hair 3"b for<br>
-4-<br><br>
painting the eyeblack 6 on the lush 7 in association with hair 2"b at the other end side 2"a of one operation lever 2" is spirally fitted to the other end side 3"a of the other operation lever 3" . Hair ends of the hair 2"b and the hair 3"b are positioned so as to be reciprocally inserted into the spiral hairless portion. The hair 3"b is formed in such a state that the outside hair is relatively longer than the inside (side for painting the eyeblack in association with the hair 2"b) hair . Preferably, hair 3"d is fitted to the tip part 3"d of the other end side 3"a.<br>
Because, according to the above aspect, the eyeblack 6 is easily painted on the lush 7, and in addition, the eyeblack 6 can also be painted on short lush of the inner corner or outer corner of the eye (claim 4).<br>

Best Mode for carrying out the Invention <br>
Preferable embodiments of the present invention will be explained, in conjunction with the attached drawings. As shown in Fig.l or the like, a pair of operation levers 2 and 3 (2" and 3") forming operation parts 1 at one end sides thereof for applying fingers thereto are formed in the form of scissors/trowel by pivotally mounting these levers at a body part. Here, the form of scissors/trowel means the state of the trowel in the configuration of scissors to be used for trimming hair. More specifically, in a pair of operation levers 2 and 3 (2" and 3") which, if the one end sides thereof are opened with fingers, operate to open the other end sides thereof, and operate, if the one end sides thereof are closed, to close the other end sides thereof, the form of scissors/trowel means, the configuration in which the lush 7 is clamped between the other end sides 2a and 3a (2"a and 3"a) thereof, when, in conjunction with the one end sides thereof closed, the other end sides 2a and 3a (2"a and 3"a) thereof are closed.<br>
The indicated at 4 is a pivotally mounting pin.  The operation parts 1 are annularly formed so that fingers are passable through there.  The indicated at 5 is an eyeblack<br>
7<br><br>
- 7 -<br>
storage container. The other end sides 2a, 2"a, and 3"a of the operation levers 2, 2" and 3" to be inserted into the eyeblack storage container 5 are formed in a paint brush form.<br>
In the case of the first embodiment of the present invention, hair 2b at the other end side 2a of the one operation lever 2 is spirally fitted. Also, hair 3b for painting the eyeblack 6 on the lash 7 in association with the hair 2b at the other end side 2a of the operation lever 2 is fitted to the other end side 3a of the other operation lever 3. The hair 3b of the other operation lever 3 is fitted so as to be positioned in such a state that hair end is inserted into a spiral hairless portion 2c of the one operation lever 2.<br>
In the second embodiment of the present invention," hair 2"b at the other end side 2"a of the one operation lever 2" is spirally fitted. Also, hair 3"b is spirally fitted to the other end side 3"a of the other operation lever 3" . The eyeblack 6 is painted on the lush 7 by using inside hair of the hair 3"b in association with the hair 2"b at the other end side 2"a of the one operation lever 2" and concurrently by using the outside hair independently.<br>
The hair 3"b of the operation lever 3" is fitted so as to be positioned in such a state that the hair end of the hair 3"b may be inserted into a spiral hairless portion 2"c of the operation lever 2".  Also, the hair end of the hair 2"b of the operation lever 2" is inserted into a<br>
8<br><br>
- 8 -<br>
spiral hairless portion 3"c of the operation lever 3".  In the hair 3"b of the operation lever 3", inside hair is relatively longer than outside hair.  In addition, hair 3"d is fitted to a tip part.<br>
Next, an example of use of a product in the present invention will be explained.<br>
Firstly, the first embodiment of the present invention will be explained.<br>
As shown in Fig.1B, a user firstly inserts the other end side 2a of the one operation lever 2 into the eyeblack storage container 5, and then the eyeblack 6 is painted on the hair 2b. Next, the user pushes and opens the operation parts 1, to open each of the other end sides 2a and 3a of the one operation lever 2 and the other operation lever 3, respectively. In this condition, the lush 7 is arranged between the" other end sides 2a and 3a, respectively.  In this case, the lush 7 is arranged in such a state that the inside hair of the hair 2b of the one operation lever 2 touches on the lower side of the lush 7 (front side of the lush when it is curled upward) . Then, the operation parts 1 are closed, and the lush 7 is clamped by each of the other end sides 2a and 3a (see Fig.4).<br>
Thereafter, the user turns out the wrist backward, and as shown in Fig.6, operates the operation levers so that the other end sides 2a and 3a are turned back to the side -of an eyelid 8.  In this way, the eyeblack 6 painted on the hair 2b of the other end side 2a of the one<br>
9<br><br>
- 9 -<br>
operation lever 2 is painted on the lower side of the lush 7 (front side of the lush 7 when it is turned back to the side of the eyelid 8), and simultaneously the tip end of the lush 7 is bent and curled to the side of the eyelid 8. In this case, in this embodiment, the hair end of the hair 3b at the other end side 3a of the operation lever 3 is inserted into the spirally hairless portion 2c of the other end side 2a of the one operation lever 2 (see Fig.5). Therefore, the eyeblack 6 is prevented from sticking to the lush 7 in a state of a large drop.<br>
Subsequently, the second embodiment of the present invention will be explained.<br>
Firstly, the other end side 2"a of the one operation lever 2" and the other end side 3"a of the other operation lever 3" are inserted into the eyeblack storage container 5, and the eyeblack 6 is painted on the hair 2"b and the hair 3"b (not shown). At this time, the other end side 2"a of the one operation lever 2" and the other end side 3"a of the other operation lever 3" may be inserted into the same eyeblack storage container 5, or may be inserted into two separate eyeblack storage containers 5, respectively.<br>
In the first stage, the user arranges the hair 3"b at the other end side 3"a of the operation lever 3" at the lower side of the lush 7 (the front side of the lush. 7 when it is curled upward), with the operation parts 1" closed. At this time, the outside hair of the hair 3"b is pressed against the lush and moved in this state toward the hair<br>
10<br><br>
- 10 -<br>
end, thereby to paint the eyeblack 6 on the lush (see Fig.9A and Fig.llA).<br>
Next, in the second stage, the user pushes and opens the operation parts 1", thereby also opening each of the other e id sides 2" a and 3"a of the operation lever 2" and the operation lever 3", respectively and the lush 7 is arranged between each of the other end sides 2"a and 3"a. The user also arranges the lush 7 so that the inside hair of the hair 2"b of the operation lever 2"   touches on the lower side of the lush 7 (front side of the lush 7 when it is curled upward). Then, operation parts 1" are closed, and the lush 7 is clamped by each of the other end sides 2"a and 3"a (see Fig.9B).<br>
Thereafter, the user turns out the wrist backward, and operates the operation levers, so that the other end sides 2"a and 3"a are turned back to the side of the eyelid 8 (see Fig.llB). Thus, the eyeblack 6 painted on the hair 2"b at the other end side 2"a of the operation lever 2" is painted on the lower side of the lush 7 (front side of the lush 7 when it is turned back to the side of the eyelid 8), and also the eyeblack 6 painted on the inside hair of the hair 3"b at the other end side 3"a of the operation lever 3" is painted on the upper side of the lush 7 (backside of the lush 7 when it is turned back to the side of the eyelid 8).  Simultaneously, the tip end of the lush 7 is bent and curled to the side of the eyelid 8. At this time, the hair 3"b at the other end side 3"a of the other operation lever<br>
\ <br>
- 11 -<br>
3" is inserted into the spiral hairless portion 2"c of the other end side 2"a of the one operation lever 2" (see Fig.10). Accordingly, the eyeblack 6 is prevented from sticking to the lush 7 in a state of a large drop.<br>
In the third stage, as shown in Fig.9C, by using the hair 3"d fitted to the tip part 3"c of the other end side 3"a of the operation lever 3", the user paints the eyeblack 6 on the lush 7 of the inner corner and the outer corner of an eye. The lush 7 of the inner corner and the outer corner of the eye are the parts where painting of the eyeblack is hardly possible with this kind of cosmetic tool according to the conventional art, or labor is required. However, according to the present invention, the eyeblack can easily be painted on these parts.<br>
With regard to the matters mentioned above, the operation parts 1 for applying fingers thereto are not limited to an annular shape in a case of the first and the second embodiments of the present invention. In addition, as shown in Fig.12, each of the other end sides 2a (2"a) and 3a (3"a) of the one operation lever 2 (2") and the other operation lever 3 (3"), respectively may be formed in a shape of a curve along the curve of the eyelid 8.  In this case, the lush 7 is easily arranged between each of the other end sides 2a (2"a) and 3a (3"a), thereby facilitating the painting of the eyeblack 6 and the curling operation.<br>
