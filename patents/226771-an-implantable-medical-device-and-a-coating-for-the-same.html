				<td>COATINGS FOR MEDICAL DEVICES<br>
This patent application is a continuation-in-part of<br>
pending United States Patent Application Serial No.<br>
09/675,882, filed on September 29, 2000.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to the use of polyfluoro<br>
copolymers as coatings for implantable surgical medical<br>
devices.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Implantable medical devices are used in various<br>
medical procedures- Such devices include, without<br>
limitation, stents, catheters, sutureis, meshes, vascular<br>
grafts, shunts and filters for removing emboli.<br>
Stents, which generally are open tubular structures,<br>
have become increasingly important in medical procedures<br>
to restore the function of body lumens. Stents now are<br>
commonly used in translumenial procedures such as<br>
angioplasty to restore adequate blood flow to the heart<br>
and other organs. However, deployment of stents may<br>
stimulate foreign body reactions thereto that result in<br>
thrombosis or restenosis.<br>
To avoid these complications, a variety of stent<br>
coatings and compositions have been proposed to reduce the<br>
incidence of these complications. The coatings may be<br>
capable themselves of reducing the stimulus the stent<br>
provides to the injured lumen wall, thus reducing the<br>
tendency towards thrombosis or restenosis. Alternately,<br>
the coating may deliver a pharmaceutical/therapeutic agent<br>
or drug to the lumen that reduces smooth muscle tissue<br>
proliferation or restenosis. The reported mechanism for<br>
delivery of the agent has been via diffusion of the agent<br><br>
through either the bulk polymer, or through pores that are<br>
created in the polymer structure, or by erosion of a<br>
biodegradable coating.<br>
Both bioabsorbable and biostable compositions have<br>
been reported as coatings for stents. They generally have<br>
been polymeric coatings that either encapsulate a<br>
pharmaceutical/therapeutic agent or drug, e.g. taxol,<br>
rapamycin, etc., or bind such an agent to the surface,<br>
e.g. heparin-coated stents. These coatings are applied to<br>
the stent in a number of ways, including, though not<br>
limited to, dip, spray, or spin coating processes.<br>
One class of biostable materials that has been<br>
reported as coatings for stents is polyfluoro<br>
homopolymers. Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) homopolymers<br>
have been used as implants for many years. These<br>
homopolymers are not soluble in any solvent at reasonable<br>
temperatures and therefore are difficult, to coat onto<br>
small medical devices while maintaining important features<br>
of the devices (e.g. slots in stents).<br>
Stents with coatings made from polyvinylideneflouride,<br>
homopolymers and containing pharmaceutical/therapeutic<br>
agents or drugs for release have been suggested. However,<br>
like most crystalline polyfluoro homopolymers, they are<br>
difficult to apply as high quality films onto surfaces<br>
without subjecting them to relatively high temperatures,<br>
e.g. greater than about 125-200°C, that correspond to the<br>
melting temperature of the polymer.<br>
It would be advantageous to develop coatings for<br>
implantable medical devices that will reduce thrombosis,<br>
restenosis, or other adverse reactions, that may include,<br>
but do not require, the use of pharmaceutical or<br>
therapeutic agents or drugs to achieve such affects, and<br>
that possess physical and mechanical properties effective<br><br>
for use in such devices, even when such coated devices are<br>
subjected to relatively low maximum temperatures.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention includes biocompatible coatings<br>
and films for use on implantable medical devices and<br>
medical devices comprising such coatings and films applied<br>
to a surface thereof that is to be in contact with body-<br>
tissue of a mammal. The biocompatible; film provides an<br>
inert surface to be in contact with body tissue of a mammal<br>
upon implantation of the device in the mammal. The coating<br>
and film comprise a film-forming polyfluoro copolymer<br>
comprising the polymerized residue of a first moiety<br>
selected from the group consisting of vinylidenefluoride<br>
(VDF) and tetrafluoroethylene (TFE), and the polymerized<br>
residue of a second moiety other than said first moiety and<br>
which is copolymerized with said first moiety, thereby<br>
producing the polyflouro copolymer, said second moiety<br>
being capable of providing toughness or elastomeric<br>
properties to the polyfluoro copolymer, wherein the<br>
relative amounts of said polymerized residue of said first<br>
moiety and said polymerized residue of said second moiety<br>
are effective to provide the coating and film produced<br>
therefrom with properties effective for use in coating<br>
implantable medical devices.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides polymeric coatings<br>
comprising a polyfluoro copolymer and implantable medical<br>
devices, e.g. stents, coated with a film of the polyfluoro<br>
polymeric coating in amounts effective to reduce<br>
thrombosis and/or restenosis when such stents are used in,<br>
e.g. angioplasty procedures. As used herein, polyfluoro<br>
copolymers means those copolymers comprising the<br>
polymerized residue of a first moiety selected from the<br>
group consisting of vinylidenefluoride and<br>
tetrafluoroethylene, the polymerized residue of a second<br>
moiety other than the first moiety and which is<br>
copolymerized with the first moiety to produce the<br>
polyfluoro copolymer, said second moiety being capable of<br>
providing toughness or elastomeric properties to the<br>
polyfluoro copolymer, wherein the relative amounts of the<br>
polymerized residue of the first moiety and the polymerized<br>
residue of the second moiety are effective to provide<br>
coatings and films made from such polyfluoro copolymers<br>
with properties effective for use in coating implantable<br>
medical devices.<br>
In certain embodiments, the invention provides an<br>
inert, low surface energy coating for medical devices that<br>
are implanted into the body of a mammal and later<br>
retrieved therefrom. The low surface energy coating makes<br>
wetting of the device surface and protein deposition<br>
thereon difficult, which could prolong the time for<br><br>
encapsulation in the body, after which time the device<br>
could be removed easily.<br>
In certain embodiments of the invention, although not<br>
necessary, the coatings may comprise pharmaceutical or<br>
therapeutic agents in amounts effective for achieving<br>
desired purposes, e.g. for reducing thrombosis or<br>
restenosis, and stents coated with such coatings may<br>
provide sustained release of the agents. Films prepared<br>
from certain polyfluoro copolymer coatings of the present<br>
invention provide the physical and mechanical properties<br>
required of conventional coated medical devices, even<br>
where maximum temperatures to which the device, coatings<br>
and films are exposed are limited to relatively low<br>
temperatures, e.g. less than about 100°C, preferably at<br>
about ambient temperatures. This is particularly important<br>
when using the coating/film to deliver<br>
pharmaceutical/therapeutic agent or drugs that are heat<br>
sensitive, or when applying the coating onto temperature-<br>
sensitive devices such as, but not limited to, catheters.<br>
When maximum exposure temperature is not an issue, e.g.<br>
where heat-stable agents such as itraconazole are<br>
incorporated into the coatings, higher melting<br>
thermoplastic polyfluoro copolymers may be used and, if<br>
very high elongation and adhesion is required, elastomers<br>
may be used. If desired or required, the polyfluoro<br>
elastomers may be crosslinked by standard methods<br>
described in, e.g. Modern Fluoropolymers, J. Shires<br>
editor, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1997, pp. 77-87.<br>
The present invention comprises polyfluoro copolymers<br>
that provide improved biocompatible coatings for medical<br>
devices. These coatings provide inert surfaces to be in<br>
contact with body tissue of a mammal, e.g. a human,<br>
sufficient to reduce thrombosis, or restenosis, or other<br>
undesirable reactions. While most reported coatings made<br><br>
from polyfluoro homopolymers are insoluble and/or require<br>
high heat, e.g. greater than about 125°C, to obtain films<br>
with adequate physical and mechanical properties for use<br>
on implantable devices, e.g. stents, or are not<br>
particularly tough or elastomeric, films prepared from the<br>
polyfluoro copolymer coatings of the present invention<br>
provide adequate adhesion, toughness or elasticity, and<br>
resistance to cracking when formed on medical devices<br>
claimed herein. In certain embodiments, this is the case<br>
even where the coated devices are subjected to relatively<br>
low maximum temperatures, e.g. less than about 100°C,<br>
preferably less than about 65°C, and more preferably about<br>
60°C or less. In such cases, preferred polyfluoro<br>
copolymers may comprise the polymerized residue of from<br>
about 65 to about 55 weight percent polymerized residue of<br>
the first moiety, e.g. VDF, and from about 35 to about 45<br>
weight percent polymerized residue of the second moiety,<br>
e.g. hexafluoropropylene. In certain embodiments, such<br>
polyfluoro copolymers will be crystalline, although<br>
amorphous copolymers of similar composition also are<br>
employed.<br>
The polyfluoro copolymers used for coatings according<br>
to the present invention must be film-forming polymers<br>
that have molecular weight high enough so as not to be<br>
waxy or tacky. The polymers and films formed therefrom<br>
must adhere to the stent and not be readily deformable<br>
after deposition on the stent as to be able to be<br>
displaced by hemodynamic stresses. The polymer molecular<br>
weight must be high enough to provide sufficient toughness<br>
so that films comprising the polymers will not be rubbed<br>
off during handling or deployment of the stent. In<br>
certain embodiments the coating will not crack where<br>
expansion of the stent or other medical devices, such as<br><br>
vena cava filters, occurs. The flow point of the polymer<br>
used in the present invention should be above 40°C,<br>
preferably above about 4 5°C, more preferably above 50°C<br>
and most preferably above 55°C.<br>
Coatings of the present invention comprise polyfluoro<br>
copolymers, as defined hereinabove. The second moiety<br>
copolymerized with the first moiety to prepare the<br>
polyfluoro copolymer may be selected from those<br>
biocompatible monomers that would provide biocompatible<br>
polymers acceptable for implantation in a mammal, while<br>
maintaining sufficient elastomeric film properties for use<br>
on medical devices claimed herein. Such monomers include,<br>
without limitation, hexafluoropropylene (HFP),<br>
tetrafluoroethylene (TFE), VDF, 1-<br>
hydropentafluoropropylene, perfluoro(methyl vinyl ether),<br>
chlorotrifluoroethylene (CTFE), pentafluoropropene,<br>
trifluoroethylene, hexafluoroacetone and<br>
hexafluoroisobutylene.<br>
Polyfluoro copolymers used in the; present invention<br>
typically comprise vinylidinefluoride copolymerized with<br>
HFP, in the weight ratio of from about 50 to about 92<br>
weight percent vinylidinefluoride to about 50 to about 8<br>
weight percent HFP. Preferably, polyfluoro copolymers<br>
used in the present invention comprise from about 50 to<br>
about 85 weight percent VDF copolymerized with from about<br>
50 to about 15 weight percent HFP. More preferably, the<br>
polyfluoro copolymers will comprise from about 55 to about<br>
70 weight percent VDF copolymerized with from about 45 to<br>
about 3 0 weight percent HFP. Even more preferably,<br>
polyfluoro copolymers comprise from about 55 to about 65<br>
weight percent VDF copolymerized with from about 45 to<br>
about 35 weight percent HFP. Such polyfluoro copolymers<br>
are soluble, in varying degrees, in solvents such as<br>
dimethylacetamide (DMAc), tetrahydrofuran, dimethyl<br><br>
formamide, dimethyl sulfoxide and n-methyl pyrrolidone.<br>
Some are soluble in methylethylketone (MEK), acetone,<br>
methanol and other solvents commonly used in applying<br>
coatings to conventional implantable medical devices.<br>
Conventional polyfluoro homopolymers are crystalline<br>
and difficult to apply as high quality films onto metal<br>
surfaces without exposing the coatings to relatively high<br>
temperatures that correspond to the melting temperature<br>
(Tm) of the polymer. The elevated temperature serves to<br>
provide films prepared from such PVDF homopolymer coatings<br>
that exhibit sufficient adhesion of the film to the<br>
device, while preferably maintaining sufficient<br>
flexability to resist film cracking upon<br>
expansion/contraction of the coated medical device.<br>
Certain films and coatings according to the present<br>
invention provide these same physical and mechanical<br>
properties, or essentially the same properties, even when<br>
the maximum temperatures to which the coatings and films<br>
are exposed is less than about 100°C, and preferably less<br>
than about 65°C. This is particularly important when the<br>
coatings/films comprise pharmaceutical or therapeutic<br>
agents or drugs that are heat sensitive, e.g. subject to<br>
chemical or physical degradation or other heat-induced<br>
negative affects, or when coating heat sensitive<br>
substrates of medical devices, e.g. subject to heat-<br>
induced compositional or structural degradation.<br>
Depending on the particular device upon which the<br>
coatings and films of the present invention are to be<br>
applied and the particular use/result required of the<br>
device, polyfluoro copolymers used to prepare such devices<br>
may be crystalline, semi-crystalline or amorphous.<br>
Where devices have no restrictions or limitations<br>
with respect to exposure of same to elevated temperatures,<br><br>
e.g. 100°C or higher, crystalline polyfluoro copolymers<br>
may be employed. Crystalline polyfluoro copolymers tend to<br>
resist the tendency to flow under applied stress or<br>
gravity when exposed to temperatures above their glass<br>
transition (Tg) temperatures. Crystalline polyfluoro<br>
copolymers provide tougher coatings and films than their<br>
fully amorphous counterparts. In addition, crystalline<br>
polymers are more lubricious and more easily handled<br>
through crimping and transfer processes used to mount<br>
self-expanding stents, e.g. nitinol stents.<br>
Semi-crystalline and amorphous polyfluoro copolymers<br>
are advantageous where exposure to elevated temperatures<br>
is an issue, e.g. where heat-sensitive pharmaceutical or<br>
therapeutic agents are incorporated into the coatings and<br>
films, or where device design, structure and/or use<br>
preclude exposure to such elevated temperatures. Semi-<br>
crystalline polyfluoro copolymer elastomers comprising<br>
relatively high levels, e.g. from about 3 0 to about 45<br>
weight percent of the second moiety, e.g. HFP,<br>
copolymerized with the first moiety, e.g. VDF, have the<br>
advantage of reduced coefficient of friction and self-<br>
blocking relative to amorphous polyfluoro copolymer<br>
elastomers. Such characteristics can be of significant<br>
value when processing, packaging and delivering medical<br>
devices coated with such polyfluoro copolymers. In<br>
addition, such polyfluoro copolymer elastomers comprising<br>
such relatively high content of the second moiety serves<br>
to control the solubility of certain agents, e.g.<br>
Sirolimus, in the polymer and therefore controls<br>
permeability of the agent through the matrix.<br>
Polyfluoro copolymers utilized in the present<br>
inventions may be prepared by various known polymerization<br>
methods. For example, high pressure, free-radical, semi-<br><br>
continuous emulsion polymerization techniques such as<br>
those disclosed in Fluoroelastomers-dependence of<br>
relaxation phenomena on composition, POLYMER 3O, 2180,<br>
1989, by Ajroldi, et al, may be employed to prepare<br>
amorphous polyfluoro copolymers, some of which may be<br>
elastomers. In addition, free-radical batch emulsion<br>
polymerization techniques disclosed herein may be used to<br>
obtain polymers that are semi-crystalline, even where<br>
relatively high levels of the second moiety, e.g. greater<br>
than about 19-20 mole percent (equivalent to about 36-37<br>
weight percent), are included.<br>
One embodiment of the invention comprises stents<br>
coated with a film of a polyfluoro copolymer according to<br>
the present invention. Conventional stents are used in<br>
translumenial procedures such as angioplasty to restore<br>
adequate blood flow to the heart and other organs. They<br>
generally are cylindrical and perforated with passages<br>
that are slots, ovoid, circular or the like shape. Stents<br>
also may be composed of helically wound or serpentine wire<br>
structures in which the spaces between the wires form<br>
passages. Stents may be flat perforated structures that<br>
are subsequently rolled to form tubular or cylindrical<br>
structures that are woven, wrapped, drilled, etched or cut<br>
to form passages. Examples of stents that may be<br>
advantageously coated by polyfluoro copolymers of the<br>
present invention include, but are not limited to, stents<br>
described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,733,665; 4,800,882;<br>
4,886,062, 5,514,154, and 6,190,403, the contents each of<br>
which is incorporated herein in its entirety as if set<br>
forth herein. These stents can be made of biocompatible<br>
materials, including biostable and bioabsorbable<br>
materials. Suitable biocompatible metals include, but are<br>
not limited to, stainless steel, tantalum, titanium alloys<br>
(including nitinol), and cobalt alloys (including cobalt-<br><br><br>
chromium-nickel alloys) . Suitable nonmetallic<br>
biocompatible materials include, but are not limited to,<br>
polyamides, polyolefins (i.e. polypropylene, polyethylene<br>
etc.), nonabsorbable polyesters (i.e. polyethylene<br>
terephthalate), and bioabsorbable aliphatic polyesters<br>
(i.e. homopolymers and copolymers of lactic acid, glycolic<br>
acid, lactide, glycolide, para-dioxanone, trimethylene<br>
carbonate, s-caprolactone, and blends thereof).<br>
The film-forming biocompatible polymer coatings<br>
generally are applied to the stent in order to reduce<br>
local turbulence in blood flow through the stent, as well<br>
as adverse tissue reactions. The coatings and films<br>
formed therefrom also may be used to administer a<br>
pharmaceutically active material to the site of the stent<br>
placement. Generally, the amount of polymer coating to be<br>
applied to the stent will vary depending on, among other<br>
possible parameters, the particular polyfluoro copolymer<br>
used to prepare the coating, the stent design and the<br>
desired effect of the coating. Generally, the coated<br>
stent will comprise from about 0.1 to about 15 weight<br>
percent of the coating, preferably from about 0.4 to about<br>
10 weight percent. The polyfluoro copolymer coatings may<br>
be applied in one or more coating steps, depending on the<br>
amount of polyfluoro copolymer to be applied. Different<br>
polyfluoro copolymers may be used for different layers in<br>
the stent coating. In fact, in certain embodiments, it is<br>
highly advantageous to use a diluted first coating<br>
solution comprising a polyfluoro copolymer as a primer to<br>
promote adhesion of a subsequent polyfluoro copolymer<br>
coating layer that may contain pharmaceutically active<br>
materials. The individual coatings may be prepared from<br>
different polyfluoro copolymers.<br><br>
Additionally, a top coating can be applied to delay-<br>
release of the pharmaceutical agent, or they could be used<br>
as the matrix for the delivery of a different<br>
pharmaceutically active material. Layering of coatings<br>
can be used to stage release of the drug or to control<br>
release of different agents placed in different layers.<br>
Blends of polyfluoro copolymers also may be used to<br>
control the release rate of different agents or to provide<br>
desirable balance of coating properties, i.e. elasticity,<br>
toughness, etc., and drug delivery characteristics, e.g.<br>
release profile. Polyfluoro copolymers with different<br>
solubilities in solvents can be used to build up different<br>
polymer layers that may be used to deliver different drugs<br>
or to control the release profile of a drug. For example,<br>
polyfluoro copolymers comprising 85.5/14.5 (wt/wt) of<br>
poly(VDF/HFP) and 60.6/39.4 (wt/wt) of poly(VDF/HFP) are<br>
both soluble in DMAc. However, only the 60.6/39.4<br>
poly (VDF/HFP) polyfluoro copolytner is soluble in methanol.<br>
So, a first layer of the 85.5/14.5 poly(VDF/HFP)<br>
polyfluoro copolymer comprising a drug could be over-<br>
coated with a topcoat of the 60.6/3 9.4 poly(VDF/HFP)<br>
polyfluoro copolymer made with the methanol solvent. The<br>
top coating can be used to delay the drug deliver of the<br>
drug contained in the first layer. Alternatively, the<br>
second layer could contain a different drug to provide for<br>
sequential drug delivery. Multiple layers of different<br>
drugs could be provided by alternating layers of first one<br>
polyfluoro copolymer, then the other. As will be readily<br>
appreciated by those skilled in the art numerous layering<br>
approaches can be used to provide the desired drug<br>
delivery.<br>
The coatings can be used to deliver therapeutic and<br>
pharmaceutic agents such as, but not limited to:<br>
antiproliferative/antimitotic agents including natural<br><br>
products such as vinca alkaloids (i.e. vinblastine,<br>
vincristine, and vinorelbine), paclitaxel,<br>
epidipodophyllotoxins (i.e. etoposide, teniposide),<br>
antibiotics (dactinomycin (actinomycin D) daunorubicin,<br>
doxorubicin and idarubicin), anthracyclines, mitoxantrone,<br>
bleomycins, plicamycin (mithramycin) and mitomycin,<br>
enzymes (L-asparaginase which systemically metabolizes L-<br>

Coatings may be formulated by mixing one or more<br>
therapeutic agents with the coating polyfluoro copolymers<br>
in a coating mixture. The therapeutic agent may be present<br>
as a liquid, a finely divided solid, or any other<br>
appropriate physical form. Optionally, the coating mixture<br>
may include one or more additives, e.g., nontoxic auxiliary<br>
substances such as diluents, carriers, excipients,<br>
stabilizers or the like. Other suitable additives may be<br>
formulated with the polymer and pharmaceutically active<br>
agent or compound. For example, a hydrophilic polymer may<br>
be added to a biocompatible hydrophobic coating to modify<br>
the release profile, or a hydrophobic polymer may be added<br>
to a hydrophilic coating to modify the release profile.<br>
One example would be adding a hydrophilic polymer selected<br>
from the group consisting of polyethylene oxide, polyvinyl<br>
pyrrolidone, polyethylene glycol, carboxylmethyl cellulose,<br>
and hydroxymethyl cellulose to a polyfluoro copolymer<br><br>
coating to modify the release profile. Appropriate<br>
relative amounts can be determined by monitoring the in<br>
vitro and/or in vivo release profiles for the therapeutic<br>
agents.<br>
The best conditions for the coating application are<br>
when the polyfluoro copolymer and pharmaceutic agent have<br>
a common solvent. This provides a wet coating that is a<br>
true solution. Less desirable, yet still, usable, are<br>
coatings that contain the pharmaceutical agent as a solid<br>
dispersion in a solution of the polymer in solvent. Under<br>
the dispersion conditions, care must be taken to ensure<br>
that the particle size of the dispersed pharmaceutical<br>
powder, both the primary powder size and its aggregates<br>
and agglomerates, is small enough not to cause an<br>
irregular coating surface or to clog the slots of the<br>
stent that need to remain essentially free of coating. In<br>
cases where a dispersion is applied to the stent and the<br>
smoothness of the coating film surface requires<br>
improvement, or to be ensured that all particles of the<br>
drug are fully encapsulated in the polymer, or in cases<br>
where the release rate of the drug is to be slowed, a<br>
clear (polyfluoro copolymer only) topcoat of the same<br>
polyfluoro copolymer used to provide sustained release of<br>
the drug or another polyfluoro copolymer that further<br>
restricts the diffusion of the drug out of the coating can<br>
be applied. The topcoat can be applied by dip coating with<br>
mandrel to clear the slots, referred to herein as the dip<br>
and wipe method. This method is disclosed in United States<br>
Patent 6,153,252, the contents of which are incorporated<br>
herein in their entirety. Other methods for applying the<br>
topcoat include spin coating and spray coating. Dip<br>
coating of the top coat can be problematic if the drug is<br>
very soluble in the coating solvent, which swells the<br>
polyfluoro copolymer, and the clear coating solution acts<br><br>
as a zero concentration sink and redissolves previously<br>
deposited drug. The time spent in the dip bath may need<br>
to be limited so that the drug is not extracted out into<br>
the drug-free bath. Drying should be rapid so that the<br>
previously deposited drug does not completely diffuse into<br>
the topcoat.<br>
The amount of therapeutic agent will be dependent upon<br>
the particular drug employed and medical condition being<br>
treated. Typically, the amount of drug represents about<br>
0.001% to about 70%, more typically about 0.001% to about<br>
60%.<br>
The quantity and type of polyfluoro copolymers<br>
employed in the coating film containing the pharmaceutic<br>
agent will vary depending on the release profile desired<br>
and the amount of drug employed. The product may contain<br>
blends of the same or different polyfluoro copolymers<br>
having different molecular weights to provide the desired<br>
release profile or consistency to a given formulation.<br>
Polyfluoro copolymers may release dispersed drug by<br>
diffusion. This can result in prolonged delivery (over,<br>
say 1 to 2,000 hours, preferably 2 to 800 hours) of<br>
effective amounts (say, 0.001 μg/cm2-min to 100 μg/cm2-min)<br>
of the drug. The dosage can be tailored to the subject<br>
being treated, the severity of the affliction, the judgment<br>
of the prescribing physician, and the like. Individual<br>
formulations of drugs and polyfluoro copolymers may be<br>
tested in appropriate in vitro and in vivo models to<br>
achieve the desired drug release profiles. For example, a<br>
drug could be formulated with a polyfluoro copolymer, or<br>
blend of polyfluoro copolymers, coated onto a stent and<br>
placed in an agitated or circulating fluid system, e.g. 25%<br>
ethanol in water. Samples of the circulating fluid could be<br>
taken to determine the release profile (such as by HPLC, UV<br><br>
analysis or use of radiotagged molecules). The release of<br>
a pharmaceutical compound from a stent coating into the<br>
interior wall of a lumen could be modeled in appropriate<br>
animal system. The drug release profiles could then be<br>
monitored by appropriate means such as, by taking samples<br>
at specific times and assaying the samples for drug<br>
concentration (using HPLC to detect drug concentration).<br>
Thrombus formation can be modeled in animal models using<br>
the 111 In-platelet imaging methods described by Hanson and<br>
Harker, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:3184-3188 (1988).<br>
Following this or similar procedures, those skilled in the<br>
art will be able to formulate a variety of stent coating<br>
formulations.<br>
While not a requirement of the present invention, the<br>
coatings and films may be crosslinked once applied to the<br>
medical devices. Crosslinking may be affected by any of<br>
the known crosslinking mechanisms, such as chemical, heat<br>
or light. In addition, crosslinking initiators and<br>
promoters may be used where applicable and appropriate. In<br>
those embodiments utilizing crosslinked films comprising<br>
pharmaceutical agents, curing may affect the rate at which<br>
the drug diffuses from the coating. Crosslinked polyfluoro<br>
copolymers films and coatings of the present invention also<br>
may be used without drug to modify the surface of<br>
implantable medical devices.<br>
Examples:<br>
Example 1:<br>
A poly(VDF) homopolymer (Solef 10 0 8 from Solvay<br>
Advanced Polymers, Houston, TX, Tm about 175°C) and<br>
polyfluoro copolymers of poly(VDF/HFP), 92/8 and 91/9<br>
weight percent VDF/HFP, respectively, as determined by F19<br>
NMR (eg: Solef 11010 and 11008, Solvay Advanced Polymers,<br>
Houston, TX, Tm about 15 9°C and 160°C, respectively) were<br><br>
examined as potential coatings for stents. These polymers<br>
are soluble in solvents such as, but not limited to, DMAc,<br>
N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), N-<br>
methylpyrrolidone (NMP), tetrahydrofuran (THF) and<br>
acetone. Polymer coatings were prepared by dissolving the<br>
polymers in acetone, at 5 weight percent as a primer, or<br>
by dissolving the polymer in 50/50 DMAc/acetone, at 30<br>
weight percent as a topcoat. Coatings that were applied<br>
to the stents by dipping and dried at 60°C in air for<br>
several hours, followed by 60°C for 3 hours in a 
Hg vacuum, resulted in white foamy films. As applied,<br>
these films adhered poorly to the stent and flaked off,<br>
indicating they were too brittle. When stents coated in<br>
this manner were heated above 175°C, i.e. above the<br>
melting temperature of the polymer, a clear, adherent film<br>
was formed. Such coatings require high temperatures, e.g.<br>
above the melting temperature of the polymer, to achieve<br>
high quality films.<br>
Example 2:<br>
A polyfluoro copolymer (Solef 21508) comprising 85.5<br>
weight percent VDF copolymerized with 14.5 weight, percent<br>
HFP, as determined by F19 NMR, was evaluated. This<br>
copolymer is less crystalline than the polyfluoro<br>
homopolymer and copolymers described in Example 1. It<br>
also has a lower melting point reported to be about 133°C.<br>
Once again, a coating comprising about 2 0 weight percent<br>
of the polyfluoro copolymer was applied from a polymer<br>
solution in 50/50 DMAc/MEK. After drying (in air) at<br>
6 0°C for several hours, followed by 6 0°C for 3 hours in a<br>
This eliminated the need for a high temperature heat<br>
treatment to achieve high quality films. Coatings were<br><br>
smoother and more adherent than those of Example 1. Some<br>
coated stents that underwent expansion show some degree of<br>
adhesion loss and "tenting" as the film pulls away from<br>
the metal. Where necessary, modification of coatings<br>
containing such copolymers may be made, e.g. by addition<br>
of plasticizers or the like to the coating compositions.<br>
Films prepared from such coatings may be used to coat<br>
stents or other medical devices, particularly where those<br>
devices are not susceptible to expansion to the degree of<br>
the stents.<br>
The coating process above was repeated, this time<br>
with a coating comprising the 85.5/14.6 (wt/wt) (VDF/HFP)<br>
and about thirty (3 0) weight percent of rapamycin (Wyeth-<br>
Ayerst Laboratories, Philadelphia, PA), based on total<br>
weight of coating solids. Clear films that would<br>
occasionally crack or peel upon expansion of the coated<br>
stents resulted. It is believed that inclusion of<br>
plasticizers and the like in the coating composition will<br>
result in coatings and films for use on stents and other<br>
medical devices that are not susceptible to such cracking<br>
and peeling.<br>
Example 3:<br>
Polyfluoro copolymers of still higher HFP content<br>
then were examined. This series of polymers were not<br>
semi-crystalline, but rather are marketed as elastomers.<br>
One such copolymer is Fluorel FC-2261Q (from Dyneon, a 3M-<br>
Hoechst Enterprise, Oakdale, MN), a 60.6/39.4 (wt/wt)<br>
copolymer of VDF/HFP. Although this copolymer has a Tg<br>
well below room temperature (Tg about -20°C), it is not<br>
tacky at room temperature or even at 60°C. This polymer<br>
has no detectable crystallinity when measured by<br>
Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) or by wide angle<br><br>
X-ray diffraction. Films formed on stents as described<br>
above were non-tacky, clear, and expanded without incident<br>
when the stents were expanded.<br>
The coating process above was repeated, this time<br>
with coatings comprising the 60.6/39.4 (wt/wt)<br>
poly(VDF/HFP) and about nine (9), thirty (30) and fifty<br>
(50) weight percent of rapamycin , based on total weight<br>
of coating solids, respectively. Coatings comprising about<br>
9 and 30 weight percent rapamycin provided white,<br>
adherent, tough films that expanded without incident on<br>
the stent. Inclusion of 50% drug, in the same manner,<br>
resulted in some loss of adhesion upon expansion.<br>
Changes in the comonomer composition of the polyfluoro<br>
copolymer also can affect the nature of the solid state<br>
coating, once dried. For example, the semi-crystalline<br>
copolymer, Solef 21508, containing 85.5% VDF polymerized<br>
with 14.5% by weight HFP forms homogeneous solutions with<br>
about 3 0% rapamycin (drug weight divided by total solids<br>
weight, e.g. drug plus copolymer) in DMAc and 50/50<br>
DMAc/MEK. When the film is dried (60°C/16 hours followed by<br>
60°C/3 hours in vacuum of 10 0 mm Hg) a clear coating,<br>
indicating a solid solution of the drug in the polymer, is<br>
obtained. Conversely, when an amorphous copolymer, Fluorel<br>
FC-2261Q, of poly(VDF/HFP) at 60.6/39.5 (wt/wt) forms a<br>
similar 30% solution of rapamycin in DMAc/MEK and is<br>
similarly dried, a white film, indicating phase separation<br>
of the drug and the polymer, is obtained. This second drug<br>
containing film is much slower to release the drug into an<br>
in vitro test solution of 25% ethanol in water than is the<br>
former clear film of crystalline Solef 21508. X-ray<br>
analysis of both films indicates that the drug is present<br>
in a non-crystalline form. Poor or very low solubility of<br>
the drug in the high HFP-containing copolymer results in<br><br>
slow permeation of the drug through the thin coating film.<br>
Permeability is the product of diffusion rate of the<br>
diffusing species (in this case the drug) through the film<br>
(the copolymer) and the solubility of the drug in the film.<br>
Example 4: In vitro release results of rapamycin from<br>
coating.<br>
Figure 1 is a plot of data for the 85.5/14.5 VDF/HFP<br>
polyfluoro copolymer, indicating fraction of drug released<br>
as a function of time, with no topcoat. Figure 2 is a<br>
plot of data for the same polyfluoro copolymer over which<br>
a topcoat has been disposed, indicating that most effect<br>
on release rate is with a clear topcoat. As shown<br>
therein, TC150 refers to a device comprising 150<br>
micrograms of topcoat, TC235 refers to 23 5 micrograms of<br>
topcoat, etc. The stents before top coating had an<br>
average of 750 micrograms of coating containing 30%<br>
rapamycin ( based on drug/[drug + polymer]) Figure 3 is a<br>
plot for the 60.6/39.4 VDF/HFP polyfluoro copolymer,<br>
indicating fraction of drug released as a function of<br>
time, showing significant control of release rate from the<br>
coating without the use of a topcoat. Release is<br>
controlled by loading of drug in the film.<br>
Example 5: in vivo stent release kinetics of rapamycin<br>
from poly(VDF/HFP).<br>
Nine (9) New Zealand white rabbits (2.5-3.0 kg) on a<br>
normal diet were given aspirin 24 hours prior to surgery,<br>
again just prior to surgery and for the remainder of the<br>
study. At the time of surgery, animals were premedicated<br>
with Acepromazine (0.1-0.2 mg/kg) and anesthetized with a<br>
Ketamine/Xylazine mixture (4 0 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg,<br><br>
respectively). Animals were given a single<br>
intraprocedural dose of heparin (150 IU/kg, i.v.)<br>
Arteriectomy of the right common carotid artery was<br>
performed and 5 F catheter introducer (Cordis, Inc.)<br>
placed in the vessel and anchored with ligatures. Iodine<br>
contrast agent was injected to visualize the right common<br>
carotid artery, brachlocephalic trunk and aortic arch. A<br>
steerable guide wire (0.014 inch/180 cm,, Cordis, Inc.) was<br>
inserted via the introducer and advanced sequentially into<br>
each iliac artery to a location where the artery possesses<br>
a diameter closest to 2 mm using the cingiographic mapping<br>
done previously. Two stents coated with a film made from<br>
poly(VDF/HFP) : (60.6/39.4) , with about 30% rapamycin ( based<br>
on drug/ [drug + polymer] ) were deployed in each animal<br>
where feasible, one in each iliac artery, using 3.0 mm<br>
balloon and inflation to 8-10 ATM for 30 seconds followed<br>
after a 1 minute interval by a second inflation to 8-10<br>
ATM for 30 seconds. Follow-up angiogiraphs visualizing<br>
both iliac arteries are obtained to confirm correct<br>
deployment position of the stent.<br>
At the end of procedure, the carotid artery was<br>
ligated and the skin is closed with 3/0 vicryl suture<br>
using a one layered interrupted closure. Animals were<br>
given butoropanol (0.4 mg/kg, s.c.) and gentamycin (4<br>
mg/kg, i.m.). Following recovery, the animals were<br>
returned to their cages and allowed free access to food<br>
and water.<br>
Due to early deaths and surgical difficulties, 2<br>
animals were not used in this analysis. Stented vessels<br>
were removed from the remaining 7 animals at the following<br>
time points: 1 vessel (1 animal) at 10 inain post implant; 6<br>
vessels (3 animals) between 45 min and 2 h post-implant<br>
(average, 1.2 hours); 2 vessels (2 animals) at 3 d post<br>
implant; and 2 vessels (1 animal) at 7 d post-implant. In<br><br>
one animal at 2 hours, the stent was retrieved from the<br>
aorta rather than the iliac artery. Upon removal,<br>
arteries were carefully trimmed at both the proximal and<br>
distal ends of the stent. Vessels were then carefully<br>
dissected free of the stent, flushed to remove any<br>
residual blood, and both stent and vessel frozen<br>
immediately, wrapped separately in foil, labeled and kept<br>
frozen at -8 0 °C. When all samples had been collected,<br>
vessels and stents were frozen, transported and<br>
subsequently analyzed for rapamycin in tissue. Results<br>
are shown in Figure 4.<br>
Example 6: Purifying the polymer.<br>
The Fluorel FC-2261Q copolymer was dissolved in MEK at<br>
about 10 weight percent and was washed in a 50/50 mixture<br>
of ethanol/water. The (ethanol/water): MEK solution ratio =<br>
about 14:1. The polymer precipitated out and was separated<br>
from the solvent phase by centrifugation. The polymer<br>
again was dissolved in MEK and the washing procedure<br>
repeated. The polymer was dried after each washing step at<br>
60°C in a vacuum oven (
Example 7: In vivo testing of coated stents in porcine<br>
coronary arteries.<br>
CrossFlex® stents (available from Cordis, a Johnson &amp;<br>
Johnson Company) were coated with the "as received" Fluorel<br>
FC-2261Q PVDF copolymer and with the purified polyfluoro<br>
copolymer of example 6, using the dip and wipe approach.<br>
The coated stents were sterilized using ethylene oxide and<br>
a standard cycle. The coated stents and bare metal stents<br><br>
(controls) were implanted in porcine coronary arteries,<br>
where they remained for 28 days.<br>
Angiography was performed on the pigs at implantation<br>
and at 28 days. Angiography indicated that the control<br>
uncoated stent exhibited about 21 percent restenosis. The<br>
polyfluoro copolymer "as received" exhibited about 26%<br>
restenosis (equivalent to the control) and the washed<br>
copolymer exhibited about 12.5% restenosis.<br>
Histology results reported neointimal area at 28 days<br>
to be 2.89±0.2, 3.57±0.4 and 2.75+0.3, respectively, for the<br>
bare metal control, the unpurified copolymer and the<br>
purified copolymer.<br>
Example 8:<br>
Utilizing the following high pressure, free-radical<br>
batch emulsion polymerization technique, a series of semi-<br>
crystalline, poly(VDF/HFP) copolymer elastomers was<br>
prepared.<br>
The VDF and HFP monomers were premixed under pressure<br>
in a pressure vessel. HPLC-grade water, surfactant and<br>
initiator were mixed outside of a 2 liter Zipperclave®<br>
reactor (Autoclave Engineers, Erie, PA) and then charged to<br>
the reactor, which then was sealed. The premixed monomers<br>
then were transferred under nitrogen pressure to the<br>
reactor. While stirring, the reactor was raised to the<br>
desired temperature and held for a predetermined period of<br>
time. The reactor then was cooled and residual monomer<br>
vented. The resultant polymer latex was removed from the<br>
reactor and coagulated or crashed by adding dilute<br>
hydrochloric acid, followed by aqueous sodium chloride.<br><br>
The resulting polymer was washed extensively with water and<br>
dried.<br>
The polyfluoro copolymers then were compared with<br>
respect to kinetic coefficient of friction of a film<br>
prepared therefrom to the kinetic coefficient of friction<br>
of a film prepared from a commercial amorphous polyfluoro<br>
copolymer comprising 59.5 weight percent VDF copolymerized<br>
with 40.5 weight percent HFP utilizing the following<br>
procedure.<br>
A 57.2 mm wide by 140.0 mm long polymer film was cast<br>
on a 101.6 mm wide by 203.2 mm long aluminum panel (Q-<br>
panel, anodized finish, A-48). A silicone rubber gasket<br>
was placed on the aluminum panel and clamped using binder<br>
clips. The mold was leveled in a fume hood using a bubble<br>
level. Approximate 5.0 g of 10.0% polymer solution in<br>
methyl ethyl ketone was poured into the mold slowly. The<br>
film was dried at room temperature for 3 days followed by<br>
3 hours at 23°C and 50% R.H. prior to testing.<br>
The kinetic coefficient of friction of the polymer<br>
film was measured in accordance with the method described<br>
in ASTM D 1894 -00, "Static and Kinetic Coefficients of<br>
Friction of Plastic Film and Sheeting", Method C. A 46.5<br>
g Teflon block, 25.4 mm wide by 41.3 mm long by 19.1 mm<br>
thick, with an eye screw fastened in one end was used as a<br>
sled. The surface of the sled that contacted to the film<br>
was polished using 500-grit sandpaper. The Teflon sled was<br>
attached to a flexible beaded chain and pulled using an<br>
Instron tensile tester at a rate of 150 mm/min., at 23°C<br>
and 50% R.H. Five measurements was made on each film<br>
sample. The thickness of the film was measured using a<br>
digital thickness gauge. The kinetic coefficient test<br>
results are given in Table I. The maximum kinetic<br><br>
coefficient of friction of five measurements of each film<br>
were averaged and reported.<br>
The Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) data were<br>
obtained on the following polymers using vacuum dried<br>
films in a TA Instruments Model 2 92 0 Modulated DSC in<br>
standard (non-modulated) DSC mode. The samples were<br>
quenched to -80°C and heated at 10°C/min to 275°C in<br>
nitrogen. The data are reported as AH (J/g) for<br>
endothermic, melting events above glass transition<br>
temperature (Tg).<br><br><br>
