BRIEF DESCRIIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1: A partial side view of a stirring device.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The present disclosure relates to a stirring device for activated sludges with a hyperboloidlike<br>
stirring body (2) attached to a shaft (1),<br>
wherein a plurality of transport ribs (3) running towards its circumferential boundary (UM)<br>
is provided on an upper side (O) of the stirring body (2),<br>
3<br>
wherein the transport ribs (3) are running inclined at least in sections with respect to a radial<br>
direction and<br>
wherein an inclination of the transport ribs (3) is selected in such a manner that, when the<br>
stirring body (2) rotates in a specified direction of rotation (R), a radial flow pointing away<br>
from the circumferential boundary (UM) is generated, characterized in that<br>
at least one propeller (6) is attached to the shaft (1) which propeller generates a flow (A)<br>
directed towards the upper side (O) of the stirring body (2) during a rotation of the stirring<br>
body (2) in the direction of rotation (R).<br>
In one embodiment of the present disclosure, the transport ribs (3) bend towards the<br>
circumferential boundary (UM) from an approximate radial direction in an approximately<br>
tangential direction directed opposite the direction of rotation (R).<br>
In another embodiment of the present disclosure, the transport ribs (3) only extend in an<br>
outer radial section of the upper side (O).<br>
In another embodiment of the present disclosure, a plurality of essentially radially running<br>
shear ribs (4) is provided on an underside (U) opposite the upper side (O).<br>
In another embodiment of the present disclosure, the propeller (6) is attached to the shaft<br>
(1) in the vicinity of the stirring body (2).<br>
In another embodiment of the present disclosure, an end of the shaft (1) extending in the<br>
vicinity of the underside (U) of the stirring body (2) is held in a safety bearing.<br>
In another embodiment of the present disclosure, another end of the shaft (1) is connected<br>
to a gear unit motor.<br>
In another embodiment of the present disclosure, the gear unit motor is a submersible motor.<br>
4<br>
In another embodiment of the present disclosure, the gear unit motor is mounted on a<br>
frame surrounding the stirring body (2).<br>
In another embodiment of the present disclosure, the safety bearing is mounted on the<br>
frame or on the bottom (5) of a basin.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a stirring device with further improved<br>
stirring efficiency.<br>
The solution to this object results from the features of claim 1. Useful embodiments of the<br>
invention result from the features of claims 2 to 10.<br>
According to the provisions of the invention, it is provided that at least one propeller is<br>
attached to the shaft which generates a flow directed towards the upper side of the stirring<br>
body during a rotation of the stirring body in the direction of rotation. Due to this flow, the<br>
pressure on the upper side of the stirring body is increased. With the transport ribs a still<br>
more efficient flow directed away from the circumferential boundary of the stirring body<br>
can be generated in the basin. The suggested solution can be implemented easily and inexpensively.<br>
In the sense of the present invention, a "propeller" is understood to mean a flowmechanically<br>
optimized device for the generation of an axial flow directed to the upper<br>
side of the stirring body, approximately parallel to the shaft. A propeller wing of the propeller<br>
can have an angle of attack which decreases radially to the outside. The propeller<br>
wing can be made of an elastic material so that the angle of attack increases as the speed<br>
increases, in particular in radially outer areas. A wing of the propeller can have a flowmechanically<br>
optimized profile similar to the wing of an aircraft wing surface. In particular,<br>
a leading edge of the wing can be rounded and a trailing edge can be formed pointed<br>
towards the end.<br>
In an advantageous embodiment of the invention, it is provided that the transport ribs bend<br>
towards the circumferential boundary from an approximately radial direction in an ap5<br>
proximately tangential direction directed opposite the direction of rotation. Due to the suggested<br>
bent embodiment of the transport ribs, an acceleration of the flow on the upper side<br>
can be achieved and thus a further increase in efficiency of the flow directed away from the<br>
circumferential boundary of the stirring body.<br>
In a further embodiment, it is provided that the transport ribs only extend in an outer radial<br>
section of the upper side. Due to the high angular velocity in the outer radial section, the<br>
effect of the transport ribs is particularly great.<br>
A plurality of essentially radially running shear ribs can be provided on an underside opposite<br>
the upper side. The shear ribs are used to swirl the air supplied on an underside of the<br>
stirring body and thus make air bubbles.<br>
To further increase the efficiency, it is provided that the propeller is attached to the shaft in<br>
the vicinity of the stirring body. A plurality of propellers can also be provided on top of<br>
each other on the shaft. This enables further acceleration of the flow generated with the<br>
propellers and directed to the upper side of the stirring device.<br>
In a further embodiment, it is provided that an end of the shaft extending in the vicinity of<br>
the underside of the stirring body is held in a safety bearing. Another end of the shaft is<br>
usefully connected to a gear unit motor. Because of the suggested two-sided holder of the<br>
shaft at the end, a precise rotary movement around an axis is achieved. Undesired swinging<br>
or precession movements of the stirring body are avoided.<br>
In a further embodiment, the gear unit motor can be a submersible motor. In this case, the<br>
stirring device is designed as a submersible device.<br>
The gear unit motor is usefully mounted on a frame surrounding the stirring body. In this<br>
case, the safety bearing is usefully mounted on the frame. This enables the device to be<br>
used in the basin as a mounting unit.<br>
6<br>
The frame can also be designed like a tower so that a gear unit motor mounted on its<br>
pointed top is above the level of the medium to be stirred. That makes the maintenance of<br>
the gear unit motor easier.<br>
Naturally, it is also possible to mount the safety bearing on the bottom of the basin.<br>
An exemplary embodiment will now be used to describe the invention in more detail based<br>
on the only drawing.<br>
The only drawing shows a partial side view of a stirring device. An attached, hyperboloidlike<br>
designed stirring body generally referred to with the reference sign (2) is mounted on a<br>
shaft (1). A plurality of transport ribs (3) are provided on an upper side (O) of the stirring<br>
body (2). The transport ribs (3) only extend over a radial, outer section of the upper side<br>
(O). They bend towards a circumferential boundary (UM) of the stirring body (2) from an<br>
approximate radial direction to an approximate tangential direction directed opposite the<br>
direction of rotation marked with the arrow (R). Essentially radially running shear ribs (4)<br>
are provided on an underside (U) of the stirring body (2). Reference sign (5) indicates a<br>
bottom of a basin (not shown here).<br>
A propeller (6) attached to the shaft (1) in the vicinity of the stirring body (2) has two<br>
wings (7) here. A leading edge (8) of each of the wings (7) has a curve running in the radial<br>
direction opposite the direction of rotation (R). Besides, the leading edge (8) can be<br>
rounded in design. A trailing edge (9) is usefully designed pointed at the end.<br>
The function of the stirring device shown is as follows:<br>
With a rotation of the stirring body (2), simultaneously the propeller (6) mounted on the<br>
shaft (1) is rotated and, as a result, an axial flow indicated with the arrows (A) is generated<br>
in the direction to the upper side (O) of the stirring body (2). The axial flow (A) is diverted<br>
by the hyperboloid-like embodiment of the upper side (O) in an essentially radial direction.<br>
It is additionally accelerated by the effect of the transport ribs (3) so that a particularly ef7<br>
fective flow directed away from the circumferential boundary (UM) is generated which<br>
flow runs essentially parallel to the bottom (5).<br>
Naturally, a plurality of propellers can be mounted on top of each other on the shaft (1)<br>
instead of the one propeller (6) shown here. In this connection, the propellers (6) can have<br>
two, three, four or five wings (7). The wings (7) can be staggered. A diameter of the propellers<br>
(6) is usefully selected so that it is smaller than the diameter of the stirring body (2).<br>
Usefully, the diameter of a propeller (6) is the 0.2 to 0.8-fold, preferably the 0.3 to 0.5-<br>
fold, of the stirring body (2). The edges of attack (8) of the propeller blades (7) can have a<br>
saber-like curve opposite the direction of rotation (R) to avoid catching braid-creating impurities.<br>
A pitch of the propeller blades (7) can be different in a direction radial to the outside. To<br>
the extent that the propeller blades (7), for example, are made of an elastic plastic material,<br>
the pitch can change depending on the speed due to an elastic deformation of the propeller<br>
blades (7). With this, a particularly effective, speed-adjusted, axial flow (A) can be<br>
achieved.<br>
