				<td>The present invention relates to a combination.<br>
The present invention relates to combinations of A) oxazolidinones of the formula (I)<br>
with B) other active ingredients, to a process for producing these combinations and to the use thereof as medicaments, in particular for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of thromboembolic disorders.<br>
OxazolidinQnesr of the formula (I) act in particular as selective inhibitors of coagulation factor Xa and as anticoagulants.<br>
It has been possible to demonstrate an antithrombotic effect of factor Xa inhibitors in numerous animal models (cf WO 99/37304; WO 99/06371; J. Hauptmann, J. Stiirze-becher, Thrombosis Research 1999, 93, 203; F. Al-Obeidi, J. A. Ostrem, Factor Xa inhibitors, Exp. Opin. Ther. Patents 1999, 9, 931; B.-Y. Zhu, R. M. Scarborough, Curr.  Opin. Card. Pulm. Ren. Inv. Drugs  1999, / (1), 63, M.  Samama, J. M. Walenga,  B.  Kaiser,  J.  Farced,   Specific Factor Xa Inhibitors,  Cardiovascular Thrombosis: Thrombocardiology and Thromboneurology, Second Edition, edited by M. Versh-aete, V. Fuster, E. J. Topol, Lippincott-Raven Pubhshers, Philadelphia 1998) and clinical studies on patients (The Ephesus Study, blood, Vol 96, 490a, 2000; The Penthifra Study, blood. Vol 96, 490a, 2000; The Pentamaks Study, blood, Vol 96, 490a-491a, 2000; The Pentatlalon 2000 Study, blood, Vol 96, 491a, 2000). Factor Xa inhibitors can therefore be employed preferably in medicaments for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of thromboembolic disorders.<br>
Thromboembolic vascular disorders are the commonest cause of morbidity and mortality in industrialized countries (Thiemes Innere Medizin, Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart, New York; American Heart Association, 2000 heart and stroke, statistical update, Dallas, TX: American Heart Association, 2000). Anticoagulant therapy has proved effective in the treatment of vascular disorders in order to prevent thrombotic vascular occlusions and to reopen thrombotically occluded vessels, and has great<br><br><br>
importance in the prophylaxis and treatment of coronary, peripheral and cerebral vascular disorders, and in the prophylaxis and/or treatment of venous thromboses and pulmonary embolisms.<br>
Thromboembolic complications may be caused by atherosclerotic lesions of the vessel wall, especially disturbance of endothelial function, which may lead to acute thrombotic occlusions. Atherosclerosis is a multifactorial disorder which depends on a large number of cardiovascular risk factors. Clinical studies have shown that prophylaxis with anticoagulants does not definitively influence the course of the arterial vascular disorder. Targeted treatment of the risk factors in conjunction with an antithrombotic therapy is therefore advantageous.<br>
Risk factors for coronary, peripheral and cerebral vascular disorders are, for example:<br>
elevated serum cholesterol levels, arterial hypertension, cigarette smoking, diabetes<br>
mellitus (Allgemeine und spetargetle Pharmacologie und Toxikologie, W. Forth, D.<br>
Henschler, W. Rummel, K. Starke; Spektrum Akademischer Verlag Heidelberg<br>
Berlin Oxford; Thiemes Innere Medizin, Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart, New York).<br>
The principles of preventive medicine are based on elimination of these risk factors.<br>
Besides a change in. lifestyle, also included are pharmacological measures such as, for<br>
example,   antihypertensive  therapy,   lipid-lowering  medicaments   or  thrombosis<br>
prophylaxis. In addition, combination with coronary therapeutic agents is suitable for<br>
the treatment where there is pre-existent coronary heart disease.<br>
It has now been found, surprisingly, that combinations of oxazolidinones of the formula (I) with certain other active ingredients have interesting properties and are more suitable for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of various diseases than the individual active ingredients alone.<br>
The invention therefore relates to combinations of A)  oxazolidinones of the formula (I) with<br>
B) other active ingredients, in particular with platelet aggregation inhibitors, anticoagulants, fibrinolytics. lipid-lowering agents, coronary therapeutic agents and/or vasodilatators.<br>
"Combinations" mean for the purposes of the invention not only dosage forms which comprise all the components (so-called fixed combinations), and combination packs which comprise the components separate from one another, but also components administered simultaneously or sequentially as long as they are employed for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of the same disease. It is likewise possible to combine two or more active ingredients together, and thus the combinations in this connection are in each case double or multiple.<br>
Suitable oxazolidinones of the combination of the invention include, for example, compounds of the formula (I)<br><br>

(Figure Remove)  and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts, hydrates and prodrugs thereof.<br>
To date, oxazolidinones have been described essentially only as antibiotics, and in a few cases also as MAO inhibitors and fibrinogen antagonists (Review: Riedl, B., Endermann, R., Exp. Opin. Ther. Patents 1999, 9(5), 625), and a small 5-[acylaminomethyl] group (preferably 5-[acetylaminomethyl]) appears to be essential for the antibacterial effect.<br>

The combinations of the invention are suitable in particular for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of arterial thromboses and embolisms associated with coronary heart disease, impairments of cerebrovascular blood flow and impairments of peripheral arterial blood flow. Combinations of oxazolidinones of the formula (I) with platelet aggregation inhibitors, anticoagulants and/or fibrinolytics are additionally suitable in particular for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of venous thromboses and pulmonary embolisms.<br>
The individual active ingredients of the combinations are known from the literature and for the most part commercially available. They may, where appropriate, just like the oxazolidinones of the formula (I), be employed in subtherapeutically effective doses.<br>
Suitable for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of arterial vascular disorders is a combination therapy of oxazolidinones of the formula (I) with lipid-lowering agents, in particular with HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A) reductase<br>
inhibitors such as, for example, cerivastatin (Rivastatin, Baycol; US 5,177,080), lovastatin (Mevacor; US 4,231,938), simvastatin (Zocor; US 4,444,784), pravastatin (Pravachol; US 4,346,227), fluvastatin (Lescol: US 5,354,772), atorvastatin (Lipitor; US 5,273,995), or with coronary therapeutic agents/vasodilators, in particular ACE (angiotensin   converting  enzyme)   inhibitors,   such  as,   for   example,   captopril, lisinopril, enalapril, ramipril, cilazapril, benazepril, fosinopril, quinapril, perindopril; An (angiotensin II) receptor antagonists such as, for example, embusartan (US 5,863,930), losartan, valsartan, irbesartan, candesartan, eprosartan, temisartan; B-adrenoceptor antagonists such as, for example, carvedilol, alprenolol, bisoprolol, acebutolol, atenolol, betaxolol, carteolol, metoprolol, nadolol, penbutolol, pindolol, propanolol, timolol; alpha-1-adrenoceptor antagonists such as, for example, prazosiri, bunazosin, doxazosin, terazosin; diuretics such as, for example, hydrochlorothiazide, furoseniide, bumetanide, piretanide, torasemide, amiloride; dihydralazine; calcium channel blockers such as, for example, verapamil, diltiazem or dihydropyridine derivatives such as, for example, nifedipine (Adalat) or nitrendipine (Bayotensin); substances which bring about an increase in cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), such as, for example,  stimulators of soluble guanylate cyclase (WO 98/16223, WO 98/16507,  WO 98/23619, WO 00/06567, WO 00/06568, WO 00/06569, WO 00/21954,  WO 00/66582, WO 01/17998, WO  01/19776, WO 01/19355, WO 01/19780, WO 01/19778).<br>
The pharmacotherapeutic aim of treatment of a pre-existing coronary heart disease is to eliminate the inbalance between oxygen supply and oxygen demand in the areas of myocardium affected by the ischemia. Suitable for the treatment of a pre-existing coronary heart  disease  is  therefore  in  particular combination  therapy  of an oxazolidinone of the formula (I) with coronary therapeutic agents, in particular with B-adrenoceptor antagonists; ACE (angiotensin converting enzyme) inhibitors; A-II (angiotensin H) receptor antagonists; nitrates such as, for example, isosorbide 5-mononitrate, isosorbide dinitrate, glycerol trinitrate; substances which bring about an increase in cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP); calcium channel blockers. Most of these compounds are also employed for therapy of hypertension.<br>
Thrombolytic   therapy  with   plasminogen   acktivators   (thrombolytic/fibrinolytic agents) such as, for example, tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), streptokinase, reteplase or urokinase has proved effective for reopening thrombotically occluded vessels. However, administration of plasminogen activators on their own does not prevent further growth of the thrombus. High doses of plasminogen activators may additionally mean an increased risk of bleeding. Combined administration of a thrombolytic   agent   with   an   oxazolidinone   of the   formula   (T)   for  opening thrombotically occluded vessels associated with coronary heart disease, transient ischemic  attacks,  stroke, peripheral arterial occlusive  diseases  and pulmonary embolisms prevents further growth of the thrombus through inhibition of thrombin formation and thus reduces the risk of reocclusion. In addition, on combination therapy with a thrombolytic agent and an oxazolidinone of the formula (I) it is possible to reduce the dose of thrombolytic agent necessary for therapy, which leads to a reduction in the bleeding complications and thus represents a considerable advantage over monotherapy.<br>
Oxazolidinones of the formula (I) can also be given in combination with other substances with anticoagulant activity (anticoagulants) for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of arterial, intracardiac and venous thromboembolic disorders. Combination therapy of oxazolidinones of the formula (I) in particular with heparin (UFH), lower molecular weight heparins (LMWH) such as, for example, tinzaparin, certoparin, pamaparin, nadroparin, ardeparin, enoxaparin, reviparin, dalteparin or direct thrombin inhibitors such as, for example, hirudin leads to an enhanced antithrombotic effect.<br>
Oxazolidinones of the formula (I) can additionally also be given in combination with platelet aggregation-inhibiting substances (platelet aggregation inhibitors) for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of arterial, intracardiac and venous thromboembolic disorders. An endothelial lesion is associated with adhesion to the wall and activation of blood platelets and simultaneous stimulation of coagulation. This leads to the<br>
formation of platelet- and fibrin-containing thrombi, and the platelets contribute to stabilizing the fibrin matrix (J. Hirsh, E. W. Salzman, V. J. Marder, R. W. Colman, Overview of the Thrombotic Process and its Therapy, pages 1151-1163 in Hemostasis and Thrombosis: Basic Principles and Clinical Practice, Third Edition, edited by R. W. Colman, J. Hirsh, V. J. Marder, E. W. Salzman. J. B. Lippincott Company, Philadelphia, 1994). Simultaneous inhibition of coagulation and of platelet aggregation therefore leads to an enhanced antithrombotic effect. Particularly suitable for combination therapy are combinations of an oxazolidinone of the formula (I) with platelet aggregation inhibitors such as, for example, aspirin, ticlopidin (Ticlid), clopidogrel (Plavix); fibrinogen receptor antagonists; (glycoprotein Hb/IHa antagonists) such as, for example, abciximab, eptifibatide, tirofiban, lamifiban, lefradafiban.<br>
All usual administration forms are suitable for administering the combinations of the invention. Administration preferably takes place orally, lingually, sublingually, buccally, rectally, topically or parenterally (i.e. avoiding the intestinal tract, i.e. intravenous, intraarterial, intracardiac, intracutaneous, subcutaneous, transdermal, intraperitoneal or intramuscular).<br>
The present invention includes pharmaceutical preparations which, besides non-toxic, inert pharmaceutically suitable excipients and/or carriers, comprise one or more combinations of the invention or which consist of a combination of the invention, and processes for producing these preparations.<br>
The combinations of the invention are intended to be present in the abovementioned pharmaceutical preparations in a concentration of about 0.1 to 99.5, preferably about 0.5 to 95, % by weight of the complete mixture.<br>
The abovementioned pharmaceutical preparations may, besides the combinations of the invention, also comprise further active pharmaceutical ingredients.<br>
The abovementioned pharmaceutical preparations can be produced in a conventional way by known methods, e.g. by mixing the active ingredient or active ingredients with the carrier(s).<br>
It has generally proved advantageous to administer the combinations of the invention in total amounts of about 0.001 to 100 mg/kg, preferably about 0.01 to 100 rug/kg, in particular about 0.1 to 10 mg/kg, of body weight every 24 hours, where appropriate in the form of a plurality of single doses, to achieve the desired results.<br>
It may nevertheless be necessary where appropriate to depart from the aforementioned amounts, in particular depending on the body weight, on the nature of the administration route, the type and severity of the disorder, on the individual behavior toward the medicament, on the nature of the formulation and on the time or interval over which administration takes place. Thus, it may be sufficient in some cases to make do with less than the aforementioned minimum amount, whereas in other cases the upper limit mentioned must be exceeded. It may be advisable, for example when relatively large amounts are administered, to distribute these over the day, in particular either in a plurality of single doses or as continuous infusion.<br>
The invention therefore further relates to the combinations defined above for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of disorders.<br>
The invention further relates to medicaments comprising at least one of the combinations defined above and, where appropriate, further active pharmaceutical ingredients.<br>
The invention further relates to the use, of the combinations defined above for producing medicaments for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of the disorders described above, preferably thromboembolic disorders, in particular myocardial infarction, angina pectoris (including unstable angina), sudden heart death, reocclusions and restenoses after an angioplasty or aortocoronary bypass, stroke,<br>
transient   ischemic   attacks,   peripheral   arterial   occlusive   diseases,   pulmonary embolisms or deep venous thromboses.<br>
The percentage data in the following examples are based in each case on weight; parts are parts by weight.<br>

A        Assessment of the physiological activity<br>
1.         Physiological activity of compounds of the formula (T)<br>
The compounds of the formula (I) act in particular as selective inhibitors of coagulation factor Xa and do not inhibit, or also inhibit only at distinctly higher concentrations, other serine proteases such as thrombin, plasmin or trypsin.<br>
Inhibitors of coagulation factor Xa are referred to as "selective" when their ICso values for factor Xa inhibition are 100-fold, preferably 500-fold, in particular 1000-fold, smaller than the ICso values for the inhibition of other serine proteases, in particular thrombin, plasmin and trypsin, reference being made concerning the test methods for the selectivity to the test methods of Examples A-l) a.l) and a.2) described below.<br>
The particularly advantageous biological properties of the compounds of the formula (I) can be ascertained by the following methods.<br>
a) Test description (in vitro)<br>
a.l) Measurement of factor Xa inhibition<br>
The enzymatic activity of human factor Xa (FXa) was measured via the conversion of an FXa-specific chromogenic substrate. In this case, factor Xa eliminates p-nitroaniline from the chromogenic substrate. The determinations were carried out in microtiter plates as follows.<br>
The test substances were dissolved in various concentrations in DMSO and incubated with human FXa (0.5 nmol/1 dissolved in 50 mmol/1 tris . buffer [C,C,C-<br>
tris(hydroxymethyl)-aminomethane], 150mmol/l NaCl, 0.1% BSA (bovine serum albumine), pH = 8,3) at 25°C for 10 minutes. Pure DMSO serves as control The chromogenic substrate (150 umol/1 Pefachrome® FXa from Pentapharm) was then added. After incubation at 25°C for 20 minutes, the extinction at 405 nm was determined. The extinctions of the test mixtures with test substance were compared with the control mixtures without test substance, and the ICso values were calculated therefrom.<br>
a.2) Selectivity determination<br>
Selective FXa inhibition was demonstrated by investingating the inhibition by the<br>
test substances of other human serine proteases such as thrombin, trypsin, plasmin.<br>
The enzymatic activity of thrombin (75 mil/ml), trypsin (500 mU/ml) and plasmin<br>
(3.2 nmol/1) was determined by dissolving these enzymes in tris buffer (100 mmol/1,<br>
20mmol/l CaCl2, pH = 8.0) and incubating with test substance or solvent for 10<br>
minutes. The enzymatic reaction was then started by adding the appropriate specific<br>
chromogenic  substrates (Chromozym Thrombin® from Boehringer Mannheim,<br>
Chromozym Trypsin® from Boehringer Mannheim, Chromozym Plasmin® from<br>
Boehringer Mannheim), and the extinction was determined at 405 nm after 20<br>
minutes. All determinations were carried out at 37°C. The extinctions of the test<br>
mixtures with test substance were compared with the control samples without test<br>
substance, and the ICso values were calculated therefrom.<br>
a.3) Determination of the anticoagulant effect<br>
The anticoagulant effect of the test substances was determined in vitro in human plasma. For this purpose, human blood was collected in a 0.11 molar sodium citrate solution in the sodium citrate/blood mixing ratio of 1/9. The blood was thoroughly mixed after collection and centrifuged at about 2000 g for 10 minutes. The supernatant was removed by pipette. The prothrombin time (PT, synonym: Quick's test) was determined in the presence of varying concentrations of test substance or<br>
the appropriate solvent using a commercially available test kit (Neoplastin® from Boehringer Mannheim). The test compounds were incubated with the plasma at 37°C for 10 minutes. Coagulation was then induced by adding thromboplastin, and the time of onset of coagulation was determined. The concentration of test substance which brings about a doubling of the prothrombin time was found.<br>
b) Determination of the antithrombotic effect (in vivo) b.l) Arteriovenous shunt model (rat)<br>
Fasting male rats (strain: HSD CPB:WU) weighing 200-250 g were anesthetized with a Rompun/Ketavet solution (12 mg/kg/50 mg/kg). Thrombus formation was induced in an arteriovenous shunt by a method based on that described by Christopher N. Berry et al, Br. J. Pharmacol. (1994), 113, 1209-1214. For this purpose, the left jugular vein and the right carotid artery were exposed. An extracorporeal shunt was formed between the two vessels using a 10 cm-long polyethylene tube (PE 60). This polyethylene tube was secured in the middle by tying in a further 3 cm-long polyethylene tube (PE 160) which contained a roughened nylon thread forming a loop to  produce a thrombogenic  surface.   The  extracorporeal  circulation was maintained for 15 minutes. The shunt was then removed and the nylon thread with the thrombus was immediately weighed. The blank weight of the nylon thread had been found before the start of the experiment. The test substances were administered either intravenously through the tail vein or orally by gavage to conscious animals before setting up the extracorporeal circulation. The results are shown in Table 1:<br>
(Table Remove) Fasting male rats (strain: HSD CPB: WU) were anesthetized as described above. The rats had an average weight of about 200 g. The left carotid artery was exposed (about 2 cm). Formation of an arterial thrombus was induced by mechanical injury to the vessel  by a method based  on  that  described by K. Meng  et  al.,  Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol.  (1977), 301,  115-119. For this purpose, the exposed carotid artery was clamped off from the blood flow, cooled to -12°C in a metal channel for 2 minutes and, to standardize the thrombus size, simultaneously compressed with a weight of 200 g. The blood flow was then additionally reduced by a clip placed around the carotid artery distal from the injured section of vessel. The proximal clamp was removed, and the wound was closed and reopened after 4 hours in order to remove the injured section of vessel. The section of vessel was opened longitudinally and the thrombus was removed from the injured section of vessel. The wet weight of the thrombi was measured immediately. The test substances were administered either intravenously via the tail vein or orally by gavage to conscious animals at the start of the experiment.<br>
b.3) Venous thrombosis model (rat)<br>
Fasting male rats (strain: HSD CPB: WU) were anesthetized as described above. The rats had an average weight of about 200 g. The left jugular vein was exposed (about<br>
2 cm). Formation of a venous thrombus was induced by mechanical injury to the vessel by a method based on that described by K. Meng et aL, Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. (1977), 301, 115-119. For this purpose, the exposed jugular vein was clamped off from the blood flow, cooled to -12°C in a metal channel for 2 minutes and, to standardize the thrombus size, simultaneously compressed with a weight of 200 g. The blood flow was reopened and the wound was closed. After 4 hours, the wound was reopened in order to remove the thrombi from the injured sections of vessels. The wet weight of the thrombi was measured immediately. The test substances were administered either intravenously via the tail vein or orally by gavage to conscious animals at the start of the experiment.<br>
2.        Physiological   activity   of   the   combinations   of   compounds   of   the formula (T)<br>
a) In vivo investigations in a rat thrombosis model<br>
The carotid artery of rats (HSD CPB:WU, Harlan Winkelmann) was exposed under anesthesia. A piece of filter paper impregnated with an aqueous 10% strength FeCls solution (dissolved in  IN  aqueous  hydrochloric  acid) was  cautiously pushed underneath the exposed vessel in accordance with the method described by Kurz et al. (Rat Model of Arterial Thrombosis Induced by Ferric Chloride, Thrombosis Research 60, 269-280, 1990). After 3 minutes, the piece of filter paper was removed. The carotid artery was removed after 15 minutes, and the thrombus was detached and immediately weighed. The animals (10 rats per group) had been pretreated with 1 mg/kg of each of the individual active ingredients (oxazolidinone of the formula (I) and   combination   active   ingredient)   or   with   the   combination   of   1 mg/kg oxazolidinone of the formula (I) and 1 mg/kg combination active ingredient. The animals in the control group had been treated with the corresponding solvent. The statistical significance was calculated using Student's t-test. Values with p
 <br>
As shown in Table 2, a synergistic effect is achieved with the combination of an oxazolidinone of the formula (I) such as the compound of Example 44 with a platelet aggregation inhibitor such as clopidogrel, i.e. the two components mutually enhance their effect. In single dosage, both compounds were inactive at the dose investigated. Combination of the two compounds by contrast led to a significant reduction in the thrombus weight. Combination of oxazolidinones of the formula (I) with a platelet aggregation-inhibiting substance is therefore able to improve antithrombotic therapy considerably.<br>
Starting compounds<br>
The preparation of 3-morpholinone is described hi US 5 349 045.<br>
The preparation of N-(2,3-epoxypropyl)phthalimide is described in J.-W. Chem et al. Tetrahedron Lett. 1998,39,8483.<br>
The substituted anilines can be obtained by reacting, for example, 4-fluoronitrobenzene, 2,4-difluoronitrobenzene or 4-chloronitrobenzene with the appropriate amines or amides in the presence of a base. This can also take place with use of Pd catalysts such as Pd(OAc)2/DPPF/NaOt-Bu (Tetrahedron Lett. 1999,40,2035) or copper (Renger, Synthesis 1985,856; Aebischer et al., Heterocycles 1998,45,2225). Haloaromatic compounds without a nitro group can initially be converted into the corresponding amides in exactly the same way in order to be subsequently nitrated in position 4 (US3279880).<br>

After hydrogen evolution ceases, 282 g (2 mol) of 4-fluoronitrobenzene are added dropwise while<br>
cooling at room temperature over the course of 1 h, and the reaction mixture is then stirred overnight. Subsequently, 1.7 1 of the liquid volume are distilled out at 12 mbar and 76°C, the residue is poured into 2 1 of water, and this mixture is extracted twice with 1 1 of ethyl acetate each time. The combined organic phases are washed with water and then dried over sodium sulfate, and the solvent is distilled off in vacuo. Purification takes place by chromatography on silica gel with hexane/ethyl acetate (1:1) and subsequent crystallization from ethyl acetate. The product is obtained as 78 g of a colorless to brownish solid in 17.6% of theory.<br>

General method for preparing 4-substituted anilines by reacting l-fluoro-4-nitrobenzenes and l-chloro-4-nitrobenzenes with primary or secondary amines and subsequent reduction<br>
Equimolar amounts of the fluoronitrobenzene or chloronitrobenzene and of the aniine are dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide or acetonitrile (0.1 M to 1 M solution) and stirred at 100°C overnight. After cooling to RT, the reaction mixture is diluted with ether and washed with water. The organic phase is dried over MgSCU, filtered and concentrated. If a precipitate is obtained in the reaction mixture, it is filtered off and washed with ether or acetonitrile. If product is also to be found in the mother liquor, this is worked up with ether and water as described. The crude products can be purified by chromatography on silica gel (dichloromethane/cyclohexane and dichloromethane/ethanol mixtures).<br>
For the subsequent reduction, the nitro compound is dissolved in methanol, ethanol or ethanol/dichloromethane mixtures (0.01 M to 0.5 M solution), mixed with palladium on carbon (10%) and stirred under hydrogen of atmospheric pressure overnight. This is followed by filtration and concentration. The crude product can be purified by chromatography on silica gel (dichloromethane/ethanol mixtures) or preparative reversed phase HPLC (acetonitrile/water mixtures).<br>
Alternatively, iron powder can also be used as reducing agent. For this purpose, the nitro compound is dissolved in acetic acid (0.1 M to 0.5 M solution) and, at 90°C, six equivalents of iron powder.and water (0.3 to 0.5 times the volume of acetic acid) are added in portions over the course of 10-15 min. After a further 30 min at 90°C, the mixture is filtered and the filtrate is concentrated. The residue is worked up by extraction with ethyl acetate and 2N sodium hydroxide solution. The organic phase is dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated.

The individual stages in the synthesis of Example 17 described above, with the respective precursors, are as follows:<br>
4.27 g (25.03 mmol) of benzyl chloroformate are slowly added to 4 g (22.7 mmol) of l-(4-aminophenyl)pyrrolidin-2-one and 3.6ml (28.4 mmol) of N,N-dimethylaniline hi 107 ml of tetrahydrofuran at -20°C. The mixture is stirred at -20°C for 30 minutes and then allowed to reach room temperature. 0.5 1 of ethyl acetate is added, and the organic phase is washed with 0.5 1 of saturated NaCl solution. The removed organic phase is dried with MgSCU, and the solvent is evaporated in vacuo. The residue is triturated with diethyl ether and filtered off with suction. 5.2 g (73.8% of theory) of benzyl 4-(2-oxo-l-pyrrolidinyl)phenylcarbamate are obtained as pale beige crystals with a melting point of 174°C.<br>
7.27 ml of a 2.5 M solution of n-butyllithium (BuLi) in hexane are added dropwise to 1.47 g (16.66 mmol) of isoamyl alcohol in 200 ml of tetrahydrofuran under argon at -10°C, a further 8 ml of the BuLi solution being necessary until the color of the added N-benzylidenebenzylamine indicator changed. The mixure is stirred at -10°C for 10 minutes and cooled to -78°C, and a solution of 4.7 g (15.14 mmol) of benzyl 4-(2-oxo-l-pyrrolidinyl)phenylcarbamate is slowly added. Then a further 4ml of n-BuLi solution are added until the color of the indicator changes to pink. The mixture is stirred at -78°C for 10 minutes and 2.62 g (18.17 mmol) of £-glycidyl butyrate are added, and the mixture is stirred at -78°C for 30 minutes.<br>
The mixture is allowed to reach room temperature overnight, 200 ml of water are added to the mixture, and the THF content is evaporated in vacuo. The aqueous residue is extracted with ethyl acetate, and the organic phase is dried with MgSCU and concentrated in vacuo. The residue is triturated with 500 ml of diethyl ether, and the crystals which have separated out are filtered off with suction in vacuo.<br>
3.76g (90% of theory) of (5R)-5-(hydroxymethyl)-3-[4-(2-oxo-l-pyrroli-dinyl)pherryl]-l,3-oxazolidin-2-one are obtained with a melting point of 148°C and an Rf (SiO2, toluene/ethyl acetate 1:1) = 0.04 (precursor = 0.3).<br>
3.6 g (13.03 mmol) of (5R)-5-(hydroxymethyl)-3-[4-(2-oxo-l-pyrrolidinyl)phenyl]-l,3-oxazolidin-2-one and 2.9 g (28.67 mmol) of triethylamine are introduced into 160ml of dichloromethane at 0°C with stirring. 1.79 g (15.64 mmol) of methanesulfonyl chloride are added with stirring, and the mixture is stirred at 0°C for 1.5 hours and at room temperature for 3 h.<br>
The reaction mixture is washed with water and the aqueous phase is extracted once more with methylene chloride. The combined organic extracts are dried with MgSO^ and evaporated. The residue (1.67 g) is then dissolved in 70 ml of acetonitrile, 2.62 g (14.16 mmol) of potassium phthalimide are added, and the mixture is stirred in a closed vessel at 180°C in a microwave oven for 45 minutes.<br>
The mixture is filtered off from the insoluble residue, the filtrate is concentrated in vacuo, the residue (1.9g) is dissolved in methanol, and 0.47 g (9.37 mmol) of hydrazine hydrate is added. The mixture is boiled for 2 hours and cooled, saturated sodium bicarbonate solution is added, and the mixture is extracted six times' with a total of 21 of methylene chloride. The combined organic extracts of the crude (5S)-5-(aminomethyl)-3-[4-(2-oxo-l-pyrrolidinyl)phenyl]-l,3-oxazolidin-2-one are dried with MgSC&gt;4 and concentrated in vacuo.<br>
The final stage, 5-chloro-N-({(5S)-2-oxo-3-[4-(2-oxo-l-pyrrolidinyl)phenyl]-l,3-oxazolidin-5-yl}methyl)-2-thiophenecarboxamide, is prepared by dissolving 0.32 g (1.16 mmol) of the (5S)-5-(aminomethyl)-3-[4-(2-oxo-l-pyrrohdinyl)phenyl]-l,3-oxazolidin-2-one prepared above, 5-chlorotbiophene-2-carboxylic acid (0.19g; 1.16 mmol) and 1-hydroxy-lH-benzotriazole hydrate (HOBT) (0.23 g, 1.51 mmol) in 7.6ml of DMF. 0.29 g (1.51 mmol) of N^-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N-ethylcarbodiimide (EDCIj is added and, at room temperature, 0.3 g (0.4ml;.<br>
2.32 mmol, 2 equivalents) of diisopropylethylamine (DIEA) is added dropwise. The' mixture is stirred at room temperature overnight.<br>
The mixture is evaporated to dryness in vacuo, and the residue is dissolved in 3 ml of DMSO and chromatographed on an RP-MPLC with acetonitrile/water/0.5% TFA gradients. The acetonitrile content is evaporated off from the appropriate fractions, and the precipitated compound is filtered off with suction. 0.19 g (39% of theory) of the target compound is obtained:<br>

General method for preparing amidines and amidine derivatives starting from cyanomethylphenyl-substituted 5-chloro-N-[(2-oxo-l,3-oxazolidin-5-yl)methyl]-2-thiophenecarboxamide derivatives<br>
The particular cyanomethylphenyl-substituted 5-chloro-N-[(2-oxo-l,3-oxazolidin-5-yl)methyl]-2-thiophenecarboxamide derivate (l.Oeq.) is stirred together with triethylamine (8.0 eq.) in a saturated solution of hydrogen sulfide in pyridine (approx. 0.05 - 0.1 mol/1) at RT for one to two days. The reaction mixture is diluted with ethyl acetate (EtOAc) and washed with 2 N hydrochloric acid. The organic phase is dried with MgSCU, filtered and evaporated in vacuo.<br>
The crude product is dissolved in acetone (0.01-0.1 mol/1), and methyl iodide (40 eq.) is added. The reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature (RT) for 2 to 5 h and then concentrated in vacuo.<br>
The residue is dissolved in methanol (0.01-0.1 mol/1) and, to prepare the unsubstituted amidines, ammonium acetate (3 eq.) and ammonium chloride (2 eq.) are added. The substituted amidine derivatives are prepared by adding primary or secondary amines (1.5 eq.) and acetic acid (2 eq.) to the methanolic solution. After 5-<br>
30 h, the solvent is removed in vacuo and the residue is purified by chromatography on an RP8 silica gel column (water/acetonitrile 9/1-1/1 + 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid).<br>

TentaGel SAM resin (5.00 g, 0.25 mmol/g) was added to this solution and reacted at 75°C for 48 h. The resin    was     filtered    and    repeatedly    washed    with    methanol    (MeOH), dimethylformamide (DMF), MeOH, dichloromethane (DCM) and diethyl ether and dried. The resin (5.00 g) was suspended in dichloromethane (80ml), mixed with DEEA (10 eq) and 5-chlorothiophene-2-carbonyl chloride [prepared by reacting 5-chlorothiophene-2-carboxylic     acid     (5 eq)     and     l-chloro-l-dimethylamino-2-methylpropene (5 eq) in DCM (20ml) at room temperature for 15 minutes] and reacted at room temperature for 5 h. The resulting resin was filtered and washed repeatedly with MeOH, DCM and diethyl ether and dried. The resin was then suspended in DMF/water (v/v 9:2, 80 ml), mixed with SnCl2*2H2O (5 eq) and.<br>
reacted at room temperature for 18 h. The resin was again washed repeatedly with MeOH,* DMF, water, MeOH, DCM and diethyl ether and dried. This resin was suspended in DCM. mixed with DIEA (10 eq) and, at 0°C, with an acid chloride (5 eq of acid derivative 1) and reacted at room temperature overnight. Before the reaction, carboxylic acids were converted into the corresponding acid chlorides by reacting  with   l-dimethylamino-l-chloro-2-methylpropene   (1 eq,   based   on  the carboxylic acid) in DCM at room temperature for 15 min. The resin was washed repeatedly with DMF, water, DMF, MeOH, DCM and diethyl ether and dried. Where Fmoc-protected amino acids were used as acid derivative 1-, the Fmoc-protective group was eliminated in the last reaction step by reacting with piperidine/DMF (v/v, 1/4) at room temperature for 15 minutes, and the resin was washed with DMF, MeOH, DCM and diethyl ether and dried. The products were then cleaved off the solid phase with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)/DCM (v/v, 1/1), the resin was filtered off, and the reaction solutions were evaporated. The crude products were filtered through silica gel (DCM/MeOH, 9:1) and evaporated hi order to obtain a set of products B.<br><br>
