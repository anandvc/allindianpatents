				<td>POWERED HINGE WITH AUTOMATIC LOCKING<br>
FEATURE AT OPPOSITE ENDS OF PERMISSIBLE RELA-<br>
TIVE ANGULAR DISPLACEMENT OF THE HINGE SECTIONS<br>
Technical Field<br>
[0001] The present invention relates generally to powered or driven hinges, and, more par-<br>
ticularly, to improved powered hinges having an automatic locking feature at the opposite<br>
ends of the permissible relative angular displacement of the hinge sections.<br>
Background Art<br>
[0002] It is sometimes necessary to provide a driven hinge for driving and powering the<br>
movement of one hinge section relative to another.<br>
[0003] For example, certain aircraft require a folding wingtip that must be locked in place<br>
while in flight and also on the ground with the wings folded. Carrier-based aircraft, such as<br>
the F-18 and F-35. may require folding wingtips to minimize the space required for aircraft<br>
storage.<br>
[0004] The present F-18 wingfold utilizes a compound planetary hinge rotary actuator to<br>
form the hinge lock. One example of this is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,783,478. This de-<br>
vice has the inherent capability to handle the loads in the extended and folded positions, but<br>
is relatively large, heavy and expensive to manufacture. The F-35, with a thinner wing, can-<br>
not accommodate this type of hinge design due to a reduced envelope. Hence, a spline lock<br>
concept of driven hinge, such as shown in U.S. Pat. No. 6,032,418, has been developed. This<br>
provides a smaller-profile hinge lock, and an overall lighter design. However, it also requires<br>
tighter tolerances and difficult machining of the hinge actuator parts, as well as the mating<br>
aircraft structure.<br>
[0005] Accordingly, it would be generally desirable to provide an improved powered hinge<br>
that would have an automatic locking feature at either end of the permissible relative angular<br>
displacements of its hinge sections, that would be lighter in weight, and that would be less<br>
expensive to manufacture.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
[0006] With parenthetical reference to the corresponding parts, portions or surfaces of the<br>
disclosed embodiment, merely for purposes of illustration and not by way of limitation, the<br>
 <br>
<br>
present invention broadly provides an improved powered hinge (20) with an automatic lock-<br>
ing feature proximate the ends of the permissible relative angular displacement of the two<br>
hinge sections.<br>
[0007] The improved hinge broadly includes: a stationary member (23) having a pivotal<br>
axis (X-X), and having a first slot (31) extending between opposite ends; a movable member<br>
(24) mounted for rotation about the pivotal axis relative to the stationary member, and having<br>
a second slot (34) extending between opposite ends; a driving member (28) adapted to be ro-<br>
tated about the pivotal axis relative to the stationary member from one angular position to<br>
another angular position, and having a third slot (36) extending between opposite ends; and<br>
an elongated pin (29) passing through the first, second and third slots, the pin being con-<br>
strained for movement substantially parallel to the pivotal axis; the first, second and third<br>
slots being so configured and arranged that as the driving member is rotated from the one an-<br>
gular position to the other angular position, the pin will be moved from substantially one end<br>
of the each of the slots to substantially the other end of each of the slots, and the movable<br>
member will be rotated about the pivotal axis relative to the stationary member.<br>
[0008] The ratio of the angular movement of the movable member to the angular move-<br>
ment of the driving member may be greater than 1:1.<br>
[0009] The hinge may further include driving means (21) for selectively rotating the driv-<br>
ing member relative to the stationary member.<br>
[0010] Each of the members may be a plate-like element. The hinge may include a plural-<br>
ity of the stationary and movable members arranged in an alternating series. The pin may be<br>
arranged to transmit torque in double-shear. In the preferred embodiment, there are at least<br>
two of the driving members. A shaft (35) may connect each of the driving members.<br>
[0011] In the preferred form, the stationary member is provided with a plurality of the first<br>
slots, the movable member is provided with a plurality of second slots, and the driving mem-<br>
ber is provided with a plurality of third slots, and the improved hinge further includes a like<br>
plurality of pins.<br>
[0012] One of the slots preferably has a recess proximate an end thereof to function as a<br>
detent to prevent the penetrant portion of the pin from moving in a radial direction with re-<br>
spect to the pivotal axis when the penetrant pin portion is substantially at such slot end. Each<br>
of the first and third slots may have this recess, and the second slot may extend in a radial di-<br>
rection.<br>
 <br>
<br>
[0013] Better yet. the one slot may have a recess proximate each end thereof to function as<br>
detents to prevent the penetrant portion of the pin from moving in a radial direction with re-<br>
spect to the pivotal axis when the penetrant pin portion is substantially at either end of the<br>
slot. Each of the first and third slots may have the recess proximate each end thereof, and the<br>
second slot may be oriented in a radial direction with respect to the pivotal axis.<br>
[0014] Accordingly, the general object is to provide a powered hinge.<br>
[0015] Another object is to provide a powered hinge having an automatic locking feature<br>
proximate the ends of permissible relative movement between the two hinge sections.<br>
[0016] Another object is to provide a powered hinge having such an automatic locking fea-<br>
ture, which is less expensive to manufacture and produce.<br>
[0017] These and other objects and advantages will become apparent from the foregoing<br>
an ongoing written specification, the drawings and the appended claims.<br>

<br>
Disclosure of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
[0027] At the outset, it should be clearly understood that like reference numerals are in-<br>
tended to identify the same structural elements, portions or surfaces consistently throughout<br>
the several drawing figures, as such elements, portions or surfaces may be further described<br>
or explained by the entire written specification, of which this detailed description is an inte-<br>
gral part. Unless otherwise indicated, the drawings are intended to be read (e.g., cross-<br>
hatching, arrangement of parts, proportion, degree, etc.) together with the specification, and<br>
are to be considered a portion of the entire written description of this invention. As used in<br>
the following description, the terms "horizontal", "vertical", "left", "right", "up" and "down",<br>
as well as adjectival and adverbial derivatives thereof (e.g., "horizontally", "rightwardly",<br>
"upwardly", etc.), simply refer to the orientation of the illustrated structure as the particular<br>
drawing figure faces the reader. Similarly, the terms "inwardly" and "outwardly" generally<br>
refer to the orientation of a surface relative to its axis of elongation, or axis of rotation, as ap-<br>
propriate.<br>
[0028] The present invention broadly provides an improved powered hinge having an<br>
automatic locking feature proximate either end of the permissible relative angular displace-<br>
ment of its hinge sections. The present invention may be used on an aircraft wingfold. How-<br>
ever, the invention has utility far broader then this one specific application. Accordingly, the<br>
invention should not be regarded as being limited to this particular end use.<br>
[0029] Referring now to the drawings, the improved powered hinge is generally indicated<br>
at 20. As best shown in Fig. 1. the hinge is shown as having a driving means 21 operatively<br>
arranged in the middle of two hinge portions, severally indicated at 22. Each hinge portion<br>
has a plurality of axially spaced stationary members, severally indicated at 23, and movable<br>
members, severally indicated at 24. The driving means 21 is operatively arranged to selec-<br>
tively rotate a shaft, described infra, by means of which the various movable hinge members<br>
22 may be selectively rotated about the pivotal axis (x-x) relative to the various stationary<br>
hinge members 23, as described infra.<br>
[0030] Fig. 2 is an isometric view of a portion of one of the hinge parts. Here again, the<br>
stationary members are indicated at 23, and the movable members are indicated at 24. As can<br>
be seen, the powered hinge has a pivotal axis x-x. A plurality of stationary hinge sections 23<br>
are spaced along axis x-x, and a plurality of movable hinge sections 24 are positioned be-<br>
tween the various stationary sections. Each of the stationary and movable sections are shown<br>
as having suitable eyes, severally indicated at 25, by means of which the associated hinge<br>
 <br>
<br>
section may be attached to other structure. In Fig. 2, the stationary hinges are depicted as be-<br>
ing attached to a suitable support, generally indicated at 26.<br>
[0031] As best shown in Figs. 2 and 3, the improved hinge is also shown as further includ-<br>
ing a plurality of driving members, severally indicated at 28, and cylindrical pins, severally<br>
indicated at 29.<br>
[0032] Fig. 4 is an isometric view showing the various stationary members 23 and pins 29.<br>
In other words, the driving members 28 and movable members 24 have been removed from<br>
Fig. 4 to more clearly illustrate the stationary members and the pins.<br>
[0033] Fig. 5 is an isometric view depicting the movable members 24 and pins. In other<br>
words, the stationary members 23 and the driving members 28 have been removed from Fig.<br>
5 to more clearly illustrate the structure of the movable members and the. pins.<br>
[0034] Adverting now to Fig. 4, each stationary member 23 is shown as being a somewhat<br>
plate-like member, having a central axial aperture 30, and having three circularly-spaced spe-<br>
cially-configured first slots, severally indicated at 31. These slots, which are shown more<br>
clearly in elevation of Fig. 6, have a somewhat S-shaped appearance, and have recesses 32<br>
proximate either end thereof. These recesses function as detents to receive the various pins at<br>
the ends of the permissible angular displacements of the stationary and movable hinge mem-<br>
bers.<br>
[0035] Referring now to Fig. 5, the various movable members 24 are shown as being plate-<br>
like elements having central axial through aperture 33, and having three radially-disposed<br>
second slots, severally indicated at 34.<br>
[0036] Referring now to Fig. 3, each driving member 28 is shown as having a central axial<br>
aperture 35, and is provided with three circularly spaced third slots, severally indicated at 36.<br>
As with the stationary members, slots 36 have recesses, indicated at 38 proximate either end,<br>
that function as detents to receive and hold pins 29 proximate the end of their permissible an-<br>
gular displacements.<br>
[0037] There are three pins, severally indicated at 29, that have passed through the aligned<br>
first, second and third slots in the stationary, movable and driving members, respectively.<br>
These various pins are constrained to move in the various slots and remain substantially par-<br>
allel to the pivotal axis x-x and all permissible locations thereof.<br>
[0038] Fig. 6 is a schematic view showing the first, second and third slots, and the position<br>
of a pin therein, at both extreme positions of movement of the movable member relative to<br>
the stationary member, as well as at an intermediate position. In the 12 o'clock position, pin<br>
 <br>
<br>
29 is positioned at being in the recess adjacent the upper end of the third slot, and as posi-<br>
tioned in the recess adjacent the upper end of the first slot, and as being at the upper end of<br>
the second slot.<br>
[0039] The driving means 21 may then be operated to selectively rotate the driving mem-<br>
bers relative to the stationary members. In the 3 o'clock position of Fig. 6, the pin is shown<br>
as having moved to the other and inner end of the third slot, the inner end of the second slot<br>
and the inner end of the first slot. More particularly, at the 3 o'clock position, the pin is<br>
shown as being in the recesses of the first and third slots. At the 1:30 o'clock position, the pin<br>
is shown as being at an intermediate position between the two extremes shown at the 12<br>
o'clock and 3 o'clock positions, respectively.<br>
[0040] The principal function of the recess proximate the ends of the first and third slots is<br>
to provide a detent to prevent the pin from moving in a radial direction (i.e., either inwardly<br>
or outwardly) when the hinge sections are at there extreme permissible angular positions.<br>
This has the feature of practically locking the two hinge sections at their extreme positions.<br>
[0041] Fig. 7 is a view of the powered hinge, again showing the profiles of the first, second<br>
and third slots and the positions of the pins therein. The position of the pin shown in Fig. 7<br>
corresponds to the position of the pin shown at the 12 o'clock position in Fig. 6.<br>
[0042] Fig. 8 is a top plan view of the driven hinge section 22, showing the stationary and<br>
movable members.<br>
[0043] Fig. 9 is a fragmentary longitudinal sectional view, showing an input shaft 35 as<br>
being concentric with pivotal axis x-.v, and is operatively connecting a plurality of driving<br>
members that are interspaced within the stack of the alternating stationary and movable<br>
members, this view also showing one of the pins.<br>
[0044] Therefore, the present invention broadly provides an improved powered hinge<br>
which broadly includes a stationary member having a pivotal access and having a first slot<br>
extending between opposite ends; a movable member mounted for rotation about the pivotal<br>
access relative to the stationary member, and having a second slot extending between oppo-<br>
site ends; a driving member adapted to be rotated about the pivotal axis relative to the sta-<br>
tionary member from one angular position to another angular position, and having a third slot<br>
extending between the opposite ends; and an elongated pin passing through the first, second<br>
and third slots, the pin being constrained for movement substantially parallel to the pivotal<br>
access; the first, second and third slots being so configured and arranged that, as the driving<br>
member is rotated from one angular position to another angular position the pin will be<br>
 <br>
<br>
moved from substantially one end of each of the slots to substantially the other end of each of<br>
the slots, and the movable member will be rotated about the pivotal axis relative to the sta-<br>
tionary member.<br>
[0045] In the disclosed embodiment, the ratio of angular movement of the movable mem-<br>
ber to the angular movement to the driving member is greater than 1:1.<br>
Modifications<br>
[0046] The present invention expressly contemplates that various changes and modifica-<br>
tions may be made. For example, while it is presently preferred that the various stationary,<br>
movable and driving members may be plate-like elements so that they may be stacked as<br>
shown in the drawings, this arrangement can be varied. The shape and configuration of first,<br>
second and third slots may also be varied. As used herein, the word slot is intended to simply<br>
define a narrow opening which defines a path of movement for the pin. The various slots<br>
may or may not have recesses at either end that function as detents to lock the pins against<br>
radial movement at the extreme ends of the permissible movement of the hinge sections.<br>
[0047] Therefore, while the presently-preferred form of the improved powered hinge has<br>
been shown and described, and several modifications thereof discussed, persons skilled in<br>
this art will readily appreciate that various additional changes and modifications may be<br>
made without departing from the spirit of the invention, as defined and differentiated by the<br>
