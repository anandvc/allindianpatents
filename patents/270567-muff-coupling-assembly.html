MUFF COUPLING ASSEMBLY<br>
KIRLOSKAR BROTHERS LTD.,<br>
an Indian Company<br>
of Udyog Bhavan, Tilak Road, Pune 411 002,<br>
Maharashtra, India<br>
THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to shaft couplings. In particular this invention relates<br>
to Muff couplings used for transmission of power between shafts.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
A coupling is used to connect two in-line shafts to allow one shaft (driver) to drive the second shaft (driven) at the same speed. A coupling can be rigid or, it can be flexible allowing relative radial, axial or angular misalignment of the two shafts. A rigid or flexible coupling is not designed for an engage-disengage type of operation. The coupling is disconnected only for maintenance or dismantling the drive unit.<br>
Various types of couplings are used to suit different applications and the most commonly used couplings are:<br>
Rigid Coupling<br>
Flanges are locked onto each of the shafts with keys and key-ways. One of the flanges is provided with recess on the mating face and the other with matching spigot. Flanges are bolted together to form rigid coupling. This coupling allows no tolerance for misalignment of the shafts namely radial, angular or axial misalignments.<br>
Muff Coupling<br>
A long cylindrical coupling is bored and keyed to fit over both shafts. The coupling is split axially and clamped over both shafts with recessed bolts.<br>
2<br><br>
Muff couplings are rigid couplings used for transmitting high torques at high speeds.<br>
Pin and bush type couplings<br>
These are similar to rigid couplings but flanges are not provided with recess and spigot for alignment purpose. The bolts are replaced by pins with rubber bushes. This design allows certain flexibility and accommodates marginal misalignment of the shafts.<br>
Flexible Rubber disc couplings<br>
These are similar to rigid couplings except that a thick rubber disc bonded between steel plates is located between the flanges. The plates are bolted to the adjacent coupling flanges. This design also allows certain flexibility and accommodates misalignment of the shafts.<br>
Spider type Coupling<br>
In this design both halves of the couplings have three shaped lugs. When the coupling halves are fitted together the lugs on one half fit inside the spaces between the lugs on the other side. A Rubber insert with six legs fits within the spaces between the lugs. The driver shaft coupling half transmits the torque through the rubber spider spacer to the driven shaft. This coupling is used only for low power drives.<br>
Chain Coupling<br>
Flanges are replaced by sprockets on each shaft. The coupling is by a duplex chain wrapped over both adjacent coupling.<br>
3<br><br>
Gear Coupling<br>
Both coupling halves have a raised rim machined as an external gear. The sleeve which couples the two shafts comprises two halves bolted together, each half having a machined internal gear. This coupling requires lubrication. The coupling is capable of high speeds and high power capacity.<br>
Metastream Coupling<br>
Coupling halves are connected using stainless steel diaphragms. These couplings have high speed, high torque capability with good dynamic balance. Single coupling will accommodate angular and radial misalignment and fitted in pairs also allows lateral misalignment.<br>
Fluid Coupling<br>
Shafts are connected to coupling halves having vanes within a housing containing viscous fluid. The rotation is transmitted from one side to the other via the viscous fluid. These couplings provide a soft start and are used in application having high static loads on the driven shaft.<br>
The selection of coupling to be used for a specific application would depend on power to be transmitted, shaft speed, space availability, level of vibration permissible and location of the coupling with reference to the bearings. Muff couplings are used in high power high speed transmission drives where there is limited availability of space around the shaft and ease of removal of system component is an essential consideration. Muff couplings have been used in applications where accurate alignment of the shaft is possible as<br>
4<br><br>
these couplings do not have any provision to accommodate radial, angular or axial misalignment of the shafts.<br>
In applications like vertical turbine pumps and wet pit vertical sump pumps where the prime mover is at a considerable distance from the impeller in the pump unit, a series of shafts, connected by rigid couplings are used to transmit the power. These shafts are enclosed in protection pipes and column pipes. The protection pipes protect the shafting from corrosive and erosive attack of liquid flowing in the column pipes. As the space available around the couplings is limited these couplings should have bare minimum outside diameter.<br>
Also components like gland packing, mechanical seal and bearings have to be replaced regularly to maintain the unit in good working condition. These couplings therefore should be easy to assemble and dismantle while maintaining the alignment accuracies.<br>
Also in these applications the transmission of power has to be through positive mechanical means like keys locking the shaft and the hub to prevent seizure of coupling with the shafts.<br>
In applications where limited space is available to mount tools required for verification of shaft alignment, accurate alignment of the shafts to be coupled is difficult and time consuming.<br>
5<br><br>
Prior Art<br>
Several attempts have been made in this field to provide muff couplings which are easy to assemble and at the same time fulfill the other essential functional requirements.<br>
US Patent 4240762 discloses a self-aligning rigid coupling assembly consisting of a pair of cylindrical rigid hubs, split rings, split spacer and shims to provide vertical position adjustment of pump shaft relative to driver shaft. Use of two separate cylindrical hubs and split spacer increases the number of components to be fastened and placement of split shims in the mating face having bolting arrangement is difficult.<br>
US Patent 5333963 discloses a shaft coupler with a cylindrical solid muff for fitment on one of the shafts and a split muff for fitment on the other shaft. Interconnection of the couplings is through fasteners provided on the flange face. Assembly and dismantling of the coupling will be time consuming as number of fasteners has to be tightened or loosened.<br>

Detailed description of the invention:<br>
Referring to the accompanying drawings, the muff coupling according to this invention is indicated generally by the reference numeral 10.<br>
9<br><br>
Referring to Figure 1, the muff coupling consists of shafts 12 and 20 having ends formed to stepped profiles 14 and 22. The shafts also have machined key way slots 16 and 24 (refer Figure 2).Keys 18 and 26 are used to lock the shafts to the muff sleeve 40. Split ring consisting of at least two elements 30 and 32 have machined inner contours 34 (refer Figure 3) complementing the stepped profile 14 and 22 machined on the shaft ends. In its assembled configuration the split ring elements 30 and 32 enclose the step profiles 14 and 22 and hold the shafts in alignment with each other and with predetermined clearances on the end faces. Also the outer surface of the split ring elements align with the out side diameter of the shafts 12 and 20. The muff 40 in the form of a sleeve has inner dimension complementing that of the shafts. In its final assembled configuration the muff contours and encloses the shafts (12, 14) and split rings (30, 32).<br>
Referring to figure 3 the split ring 30 and 32 have machined inner contours 34 with chamfers 38 provided to protect the step profile 14 and 22 machined on the shaft ends and position the shafts with reference to each other with adequate and predetermined clearances on the end faces. The split rings 30 and 32 have V grooves 36 on their mating faces for easy disassembly of the coupling.<br>
For quick assembly of the muff coupling a coupling pusher (refer Figure 5 and 6) indicated generally by the reference numeral 50 is used. The coupling pusher consists of two halves 52 and 54 bolted together with fasteners 58. The coupling pusher is tightened on one of the shafts and threaded bolts 56 are tightened in a sequential manner to push the muff along the shaft to its final position.<br>
10<br><br>
Figure 8 shows a split ring wedge tool used to quickly dislodge the split<br>
rings 30 and 32 during dismantling of the coupling. The tool has an included<br>
wedge angle sufficient to split the rings with out damaging the outer<br>
surfaces.<br>
Figure 9 shows the solid exploded view of the muff coupling.<br>
