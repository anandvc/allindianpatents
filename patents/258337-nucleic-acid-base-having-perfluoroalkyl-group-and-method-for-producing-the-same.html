				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
NUCLEOBASE HAVING PERFLUOROALKYL GROUP AND PROCESS FOR<br>
PRODUCING THE SAME<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a process for<br>
producing a nucleobase having a perfluoroalkyl group.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Nucleobases substituted by a perfluoroalkyl group<br>
are important compounds as medical drugs and<br>
intermediates for medical and agricultural chemicals, and<br>
nucleobases having a trifluoromethyl group are<br>
particularly useful compounds. Therefore, many studies<br>
have been conducted on processes for producing the<br>
trifluoromethyl-substituted nucleobases.<br>
With respect to a method for producing 5-<br>
trifluoromethyl uracil which is important as an<br>
intermediate for an anticancer agent, an antiviral agent,<br>
or the like, for example, Patent Document 1 discloses a<br>
method for producing 5-trifluoromethyl uracil by reacting<br>
5-trifluoromethyl-5,6-dihydrouracil which is obtained by<br>
a reaction of -trifluoromethyl acrylic acid and urea,<br>
with dimethyl sulfoxide and iodine in the presence of<br>
concentrated sulfuric acid as a catalyst. Furthermore,<br>
Patent Document 2 discloses a method of reacting 5-<br><br>
iodouracils with copper iodide and methyl<br>
fluorosulfonyldifluoroacetate to convert them to a 5-<br>
trifluoromethyluracils. Moreover, Patent Document 3<br>
discloses a method for producing 5-trifluoromethyluracil,<br>
in which thymine is chlorinated with a chlorine gas to<br>
form 2,4-dichloro-5-trichloromethylpyrimidine, and then<br>
fluorinated with anhydrous hydrofluoric acid or antimony<br>
trifluoride in the coexistence with antimony<br>
pentachloride, followed by a treatment with water.<br>
However, these methods have problems that all the methods<br>
include multi-steps and the last method uses anhydrous<br>
hydrofluoric acid and the antimony compound which are<br>
industrially hard to handle. Moreover, Non-patent<br>
Document 1 discloses a method for trifluoromethylating<br>
3',5'-diacetyl-2'-deoxyuridine at the 5-position with<br>
trifluoroacetic acid and xenon difluoride. However, this<br>
method also uses a special reagent and is industrially<br>
hard to employ.<br>
Furthermore, with respect to a method for producing<br>
5-trifluoromethylcytosine, Non-patent Document 2<br>
discloses a method for producing 5-<br>
trifluoromethylcytosine by hydrolyzing 4-amino-2-chloro-<br>
5-trifluoromethylpyrimidine obtained by a reaction of<br>
2,4-dichloro-5-trifluoromethylpyrimidine and liquid<br>
ammonia, and treating it with an ion-exchange resin.<br>
However, this method has a problem of multi-steps<br>
including production of raw materials.<br><br>
With respect to a method for producing a purine<br>
compound having a trifluoromethyl group, for example,<br>
Non-patent Document 3 discloses a method for producing 8-<br>
trifluoromethyladenine, 2,6-diamino-8-<br>
trifluoromethylpurine and 8-trifluoromethylhypoxanthine<br>
by reacting 4,5-diaminopyrimidines with trifluoroacetic<br>
acid or trifluoroacetic anhydride. Non-patent Document 4<br>
discloses a method for producing 8-trifluoromethylguanine<br>
by reacting 2,4-diamino-5-trifluoroacetamino-6-oxo-l,6-<br>
dihydropyrimidine, which is obtained by a reaction of<br>
2,4,5-triamino-6-oxo-l,6-dihydropyrimidine and<br>
trifluoroacetic acid, with trifluoroacetic anhydride.<br>
However, all of these methods also industrially have a<br>
problem of multi-steps including production of raw<br>
materials.<br>
With respect to direct perfluoroalkylation of these<br>
nucleobases, for example, Patent Document 4 discloses a<br>
method for producing purines having a perfluoroalkyl<br>
group at the 8-position or 2-position by reacting purines<br>
with N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide in the<br>
presence of pyridine and trimethylchlorosilane as<br>
catalysts and then reacting the resultant with bis<br>
(perfluoroalkyl) peroxide. However, this method has<br>
problems that it uses di(haloacyl) peroxide which is<br>
industrially hard to handle, that it uses a<br>
chlorofluorocarbon solvent and that it forms regioisomers<br>
with the substituent at the different positions.<br><br>
Furthermore, Non-patent Documents 5 and 6 disclose a<br>
method for producing 8-perfluorobutyluracil, 8-<br>
perfluorobutylhypoxanthine and an 8-<br>
perfluorobutylxanthine salts by the formation of a uracil<br>
anion electrochemically, followed by the reaction with<br>
perfluorobutyl iodide. However, this method has problems<br>
that it uses the electrochemical technique which is<br>
industrially hard to use and that the resulting product<br>
is a salt of a supporting electrolyte.<br>
Non-patent Document 7 discloses a method for<br>
producing 8-trifluoromethylcaffeine by reacting 8-<br>
trifluoromethyltheophylline obtained by a reaction of<br>
5,6-diamino-1,3-dimethyluracil and trifluoroacetic<br>
anhydride, with potassium carbonate and methyl iodide in<br>
N,N-dimethylformamide. However, this method industrially<br>
has a problem of multi-steps including production of raw<br>
materials.<br>
With respect to perfluoroalkylation with a<br>
perfluoroalkyl halide, Non-patent Document 8 discloses a<br>
method for obtaining trifluoromethylnucleosides by<br>
reacting 2',3',5'-tri-O-acetylated iodonucleosides with<br>
copper powder and trifluoromethyl iodide in<br>
hexamethylphosphoric triamide to obtain a 2',3',5'-tri-O-<br>
acetylated trifluoromethylnucleosides, and followed by<br>
deprotecting them. However, this method also has<br>
problems of multi-steps and use of hexamethylphosphoric<br>
triamide which is industrially hard to use.<br><br>
Moreover, Non-patent Documents 9 and 10 disclose a<br>
process using perfluorobutyl iodide or perfluoropropyl<br>
iodide which is liquid at room temperature, through the<br>
use of dimethyl sulfoxide, hydrogen peroxide and ferric<br>
sulfate. However, substrates are restricted to pyrroles,<br>
indoles and substituted benzenes. Furthermore, there is<br>
no description with respect to trifluoromethylation using<br>
a perfluoroalkyl halide which is gas at room temperature,<br>
for example, trifluoromethyl iodide.<br>
