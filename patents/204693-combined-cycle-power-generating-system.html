[See Section 10; rule 13] A COMBINED CYCLE POWER GENERATING SYSTEM<br>
JGC CORPORATION, of 2-1 Otemachi 2-chome, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo 100-0004,Japan<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the<br>
manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br><br>
SPECIFICATION<br>
COMBINED CYCLE GENERATING SYSTEM<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention relates to a combined cycle generating system, and more particularly to such a system which is adapted to carry out combined cycle generation using, for example, crude oil, or heavy oil or residue oil produced in a petroleum refinery.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Residue oil produced in a petroleum refinery is generally utilized as heavy oil in an oil thermal power plant after a sulfur concentration of the residue oil and viscosity thereof are adjusted. In the oil thermal power plant, heavy oil is used as a heat source for a boiler to generate water vapor or steam at a high pressure, to thereby operate a steam turbine. However, a current technical level causes thermal efficiency of the plant to be limited to a level as low as about 36% in terms of a gross calorific value.<br>
In the art of gas turbine power generation, a combined cycle generating system is developed in which driving of a gas turbine by gas combustion and driving of a steam turbine by recovery of exhaust gas at an increased temperature (high-temperature exhaust gas) are combined together. Thus, such combined cycle generation is adapted to rotate a gas turbine using combustion gas obtained by combustion of fuel gas to carry out power generation and recover waste heat from high-temperature exhaust gas discharged from the gas turbine to generate steam, to thereby rotate the steam turbine, leading to power generation. The combined cycle generating system permits thermal efficiency to be increased to a level as high as about 48% in terms of a gross calorific value, so that energy may be effectively available.<br>
Techniques relating to gasifying composite power generation are disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Publication No. 317407/1997.  More particularly,<br><br><br><br>
page 2<br><br>
the techniques disclosed therein are constructed so as to separate a light fuel from a heavy oil or residue by, for example, separation due to heating or atmospheric distillation to operate a gas turbine using the light oil fuel. The remaining heavy matter is used as a fuel for an exhaust recombustion boiler together with exhaust gas discharged from the gas turbine, so that steam generated by the boiler may be used for driving a steam turbine.<br>
For example, a high-boiling fraction (heavy fuel) such as residue oil, heavy oil or the like produced in a petroleum refinery contains an oil matter satisfactorily available as a fuel for a gas turbine after it is subject to a suitable treatment. Unfortunately, the techniques disclosed in the Japanese publication are adapted to use all the high-boiling fraction as a. fuel for the boiler of the steam turbine, resulting in failing to use the high-boiling fraction to a maximum degree, so that it is highly required to further increase energy efficiency.<br>
The present invention has been made in view of the foregoing disadvantage of the prior art.<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a combined cycle generating system which is capable of converting atmospheric residue oil into electrical energy with significantly increased efficiency.<br>

When the solvent extraction means is used, asphaltenes (raffinate) produced in the solvent extraction means is pulverized and mixed with water, resulting in a slurry being formed.

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Now, a combined cycle generating system according to the present invention will be described hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
Referring first to Fig. 1, a first embodiment of a combined cycle generating system according to the present invention is illustrated. A combined cycle generating system of the illustrated embodiment includes atmospheric distillation means 1, at a rear stage of which a process (not shown) for treating a light distillate or light oil produced in the atmospheric distillation means 1 and a process for treating atmospheric residue oil produced in the atmospheric distillation means 1 to which the present invention is applied are arranged.<br>
The atmospheric residue oil treating process includes vacuum distillation means 10 constituted by a heating furnace or a heater 11 and a vacuum distillation column 12 so as to act as first separation means, a gas turbine generating section 20 and a steam turbine generating section 30 each arranged at a rear stage of the vacuum distillation means 10, a flue gas desulfurization and/or denitrification unit or a flue gas treatment unit (FGT) 4 arranged at a rear stage of the steam turbine generating section 30 so as to subject flue gas or exhaust gas to desulfurization and denitrification.<br>
The vacuum distillation column 12 is evacuated, to thereby be reduced in pressure therein to a predetermined level by means of a pressure reducing unit. Thus, atmospheric residue oil which is heated to a temperature at a predetermined level by the heating furnace 11 is fed into the vacuum distillation column 12 through a central portion thereof, resulting in being distilled under a pressure at a predetermined level. This permits the atmospheric residue oil to be separated into a light matter and a heavy matter on the basis of a difference in boiling point therebetween, so that<br>
page <br><br>
the light matter and heavy matter may be recovered from a top of the vacuum distillation column 12 and a bottom thereof, respectively.<br>
The gas turbine generating section 20 includes a gas turbine 21 and a generator 22 and is so constructed that fuel oil is burnt with oxygen (or air) resulting in providing combustion gas, which is then guided to the gas turbine 21 to rotate the turbine 21, resulting in che generator 22 carrying out power generation. Flue gas or exhaust gas at a high temperature discharged from the gas turbine 21 is fed to a boiler section 31 of the steam turbine generating section 30 so as to act as a heat source.<br>
The steam turbine generating section 30 includes a turbine 32 and a generator 33 as well as the above-described boiler section 31. Fuel oil and exhaust gas at an elevated temperature each are used as a heat source for heating water in the boiler section 31 to produce steam in the boiler section 31. Steam thus produced in the boiler section 31 permits the turbine 32 to be rotated, so that the generator 33 carries out power generation.<br>
In the combined cycle generating, system of the illustrated embodiment thus constructed, first of all, feed oil such as crude oil is subject to atmospheric distillation in the atmospheric distillation means 1, to thereby be separated into a light distillate or light oil and atmospheric residue oil. Then, the light distillate is subject to a suitable treatment such as a hydrotreating process, a gasoline producing process or the like in the treatment process (not shown), so that LPG, gasoline, kerosene, gas oil and the like may be produced.<br>
The atmospheric residue oil described above is heated to a predetermined temperature in the heating furnace 11 and then subject to vacuum distillation under predetermined conditions in the vacuum distillation column 12, so that a light matter (VGO) and a heavy matter or vacuum residue oil (VR) are discharged through the top of the vacuum distillation column 12 and the bottom thereof, respectively. The light matter is fed in the form of a fuel to the gas turbine 21 and the heavy<br>
page 8<br><br>
matter is fed as a fuel to the boiler section 31.<br>
Thus, in the gas turbine generating section 20, the above-described light matter is used as a fuel therefor to rotate the gas turbine 21, leading to power generation. Flue gas or exhaust gas at an elevated temperature or high-temperature exhaust gas discharged from the gas turbine 21 is fed to the boiler section 31. In the steam turbine generating section 30, the heavy matter and high-temperature exhaust gas described above are used as a heat source for the boiler section 31, to thereby permit rotation of the turbine 32, leading to power generation.<br>
The boiler section 31 may be constructed in such a manner as shown in Fig. 2 by way of example. The boiler section 31 may be constituted by, for example, a waste heat recovery boiler 31a for heating water by means of the above-described high-temperature exhaust gas and a combustion boiler 31b for burning the heavy matter to heat water and may be so constructed that water vapor or high pressure steam generated from each of the waste heat recovery boiler 31a and combustion boiler 31b is fed to the turbine 32 of the steam turbine generating section 30. If the heavy matter is burned in the waste heat recovery boiler 31a, a combustion residue adheres to a heat transfer surface of the waste heat recovery boiler 31a, resulting in heat recovery being deteriorated. Thus, the boiler section 31 may be preferably constructed in such a manner that a portion for generating steam by means of the high-temperature exhaust gas and a portion for burning the heavy matter to generate steam are arranged separately from each other. Also, in the illustrated embodiment, steam generated from the waste heat recovery boiler 31a and that generated from the combustion boiler 31b are fed to the common turbine. Alternatively, the steams may be fed to turbines arranged separately from each other, respectively. Flue gas or exhaust gas discharged from the steam turbine generating section 30 is fed to the flue gas desulfurization and/or denitrification unit 4 briefly described, wherein SOx is recovered in the form of a plaster and NOx is reduced by means of ammonia, to thereby be recovered in the form of nitrogen.<br>
page  9<br><br>
The illustrated embodiment is featured in that the atmospheric residue oil is subject to vacuum distillation, to thereby be separated into the light matter and heavy matter. Now, reasons for such vacuum distillation will be described hereinafter. When petroleum is heated to a temperature above a predetermined level, it is subject to thermal cracking, leading to a deterioration in quality thereof. In the system of the illustrated embodiment, residue oil by atmospheric distillation is used as a feed stock. The residue oil is increased in boiling point under an atmospheric pressure, so that it is required to carry out distillation of the residue oil at a reduced temperature in order to prevent thermal cracking of the residue oil. Thus, it is required to reduce a pressure in the distillation column in order to vaporize the residue oil at a relatively low temperature.<br>
Also, the light matter produced by the vacuum distillation desirably has viscosity of 20 set or less at 130°C and preferably 10 set or less at 130"^ in order to exhibit satisfactory atomizing characteristics in.the gas turbine. Whereas, the heavy matter or vacuum residue oil is used as a fuel for the boiler section 31, to thereby be required to exhibit flowability to a degree. Thus, the heavy matter or vacuum residue oil desirably exhibits viscosity of 50 set or<br>
less at 300t and preferably 30 set or less at 300°C.<br>
Viscosity of each of the light matter and vacuum residue oil depends on conditions for vacuum distillation in the vacuum distillation column 12, so that the conditions such as a pressure for distillation, a temperature therefor and the like are desirably set so as to permit the viscosity to be within the predetermined range described above. In order to ensure that such conditions are effectively set, the atmospheric residue oil is heated to a predetermined temperature in the heating furnace 11 and an interior of the vacuum distillation column 12 is reduced in pressure by means of the pressure reducing unit. Also, cooling of the vacuum residue oil causes flowability thereof to be decreased, therefore, feeding of the vacuum residue oil to the boiler section 31 is carried out without being cooled after the vacuum distillation.<br>
page 10<br><br>
Such construction of the illustrated embodiment wherein the atmospheric residue oil is subject to vacuum distillation permits the atmospheric residue oil increased in boiling point to be separated into the light matter and heavy matter while keeping the oil highly thermally stabilized. Also, the vacuum distillation under the predetermined conditions permits viscosity of each of the light matter and heavy matter to be within the predetermined range. Further, the illustrated embodiment ensures that the vacuum residue oil which is highly less movable to a degree substantially hard to be fed as a fuel when it is cooled is smoothly fed to the boiler section 31 while exhibiting increased flowability under conditions of a high temperature, so that transportation of the vacuum residue oil may be enhanced.<br>
Also, the illustrated embodiment is constructed so as to carry out combined cycle generation using the heavy matter and the high-temperature exhaust gas of the gas turbine 21 as a heat source for the steam turbine generating section 30. Such construction further enhances power generation efficiency. In addition, when the system of the illustrated embodiment is installed in a petroleum refinery, it is possible to provide a compact composite plant of the petroleum refinery and a power generating station which exhibits high efficiency, to thereby maximize energy efficiency of the petroleum refinery and power generating station.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 3, a second embodiment of a combined cycle generating system according to the present invention is illustrated. A combined cycle generating system of the second embodiment may be constructed in substantially the same manner as the first embodiment described above, except that atmospheric residue oil is subject to solvent extraction, resulting in being separated into a light matter or deasphalted oil and a heavy matter or asphaltenes (raffinate). In the illustrated embodiment, a treatment process for the atmospheric residue oil includes solvent extraction means 50 constituted of a solvent extraction column 51 and a solvent evaporation section 52 and acting as first separation means, demetallization means arranged at a rear stage of the solvent<br>
page11<br><br>
extraction means 50 and constituted by, for example, a hydrodemetallization unit 53, a gas turbine generating section 20 and a steam turbine generating section 30 each arranged at a rear stage of the hydro-demetallization unit 53, a flue gas desulfurization and/or denitrification unit (SRU) 4 arranged at a rear stage of the steam turbine generating section 30. The gas turbine generating section 20, steam turbine generating section 30 and flue gas desulfurization and/or denitrification unit 4 may be constructed in substantially the same manner as those in the first embodiment described above.<br>
The solvent extraction column 51 is fed therein with atmospheric residue oil and a solvent such as propane or the like, which are counterflow-contacted with each other by means of agitating blades 51a being rotated, so that the atmospheric residue oil may be separated into a light matter soluble in the solvent and a heavy matter insoluble therein due to a difference in solubility in the solvent between the light matter and the heavy matter. The solvent evaporation section 52 is constructed so as to separate the light matter and solvent from each other by, for example, distillation. The hydrodemetallization 53 includes a reactor provided therein with a catalyst exhibiting a high demetallization capability and is constructed so as to feed the above-described deasphalted oil to the treatment column together with highly pressurized hydrogen gas to cut a portion of the deasphalted oil to which metal is bonded by means of hydrogen. The deasphalted oil from which metal is removed is then guided to a low-pressure drum, to thereby be rapidly reduced in pressure thereof, so that a gas matter may be separated from a liquid matter, resulting in deasphalted oil for the gas turbine being prepared. The hydrodemetallization unit 53 may be provided therein with catalysts exhibiting a desulfurization function.<br>
In the second embodiment, the atmospheric residue oil is subject to counterflow-contact with the solvent in the solvent extraction column 51, leading to separation into the light matter and the heavy matter or asphaltenes (raffinate) . Then, the light matter is recovered through a top of the column 51 together with the solvent and the asphaltenes (raffinate)<br>
page 12<br><br>
is recovered through a bottom of the column. The solvent containing the light matter is fed to the solvent evaporation section 52, wherein the solvent is removed, so that the resultant deasphalted oil (DAO) is fed to the hydrodemetallization unit 53. The unit 53 removes any impurities such as metal and the like contained in the deasphalted oil therefrom and then the deasphalted oil is fed in the foim of a fuel to a gas turbine 21. ConcurLently, the asphaltenes (raffinate) recovered through the bottom of the solvent extraction column 51 is pulverized in a slurrying treatment section 13, wherein it is mixed with water to form a slurry, which is then fed in the form of a heat source to a boiler section 31 together with flue gas or exhaust gas at an elevated temperature discharged from the gas turbine 21, so that power generation may be attained in the gas turbine generating section 20 and steam turbine generating section 30 as in the first embodiment described above.<br>
In the system of the illustrated embodiment, the hydrodemetallization unit 53 is arranged as described above. This is for the reason that production of deasphalted oil in an increased amount causes inclusion of a metal impurity into the light matter, leading to corrosion of the gas turbine due to the metal thus included.<br>
One of features of the illustrated embodiment is that the atmospheric residue oil is subject to solvent extraction, resulting in being separated into the deasphalted oil and asphaltenes (raffinate). In this respect, the illustrated embodiment permits an increase in extraction efficiency of the deasphalted oil, so that the solvent extraction leads to an increase in the amount of fuel for the gas turbine 21 recovered, as compared with other separation techniques.<br>
Also, the solvents used in the solvent extraction column 51 include, for example, propane, isobutane, n-butane, n-pentane and the like. The solvents to be used are selected depending on properties of the atmospheric residue oil. Of the operation conditions, a temperature and a solvent oil ratio are important or essential. The temperature and solvent oil ratio are determined depending on properties of the atmospheric<br>
page 13<br><br>
residue oil in view of recovery of the DAO and selection of the solvents.<br>
In  the  illustrated  embodiment,  the  asphaltenes<br>
(raffinate) preferably has viscosity set to be within a range<br>
of 50 set or less at 300°C and preferably 30 set or less at<br>
300°C in view of flowability of the asphaltenes (raffinate) .<br>
Viscosity of the asphaltenes (raffinate) is determined by a<br>
solvent extraction ratio, which may be adjusted by varying a<br>
type of the solvent, the solvent oil ratio, the temperature<br>
and the like.  Thus, such factors are so determined that<br>
viscosity of the asphaltenes (raffinate) is set to be within<br>
the above-described range. The illustrated embodiment may be<br>
constructed without using the hydrodemetallization unit 53.<br>
Alternatively, a carbon adsorption unit, a desalting unit or<br>
a  combination  thereof may     be     substituted      for      the<br>
hydrodemetallization unit 53.<br>
Thus, in the illustrated embodiment, the atmospheric residue oil is subject to solvent extraction, to thereby permit the deasphalted oil to be separated at increased efficiency, leading to an increase in efficiency of power generation by the gas turbine. Practicing of the solvent,extraction under the predetermined extraction conditions permits viscosity of the asphaltenes (raffinate) to be adjusted as desired, so that the asphaltenes (raffinate) may be used as a fuel for the steam turbine generating section 30. This results in the combined cycle generation being possible using the atmospheric residue oil as a feed oil, so that the atmospheric residue oil may be effectively available.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 4, a third embodiment of a combined cycle generating system according to the present invention is illustrated. A combined cycle generating system of the illustrated or third embodiment is constructed in substantially the same manner as the embodiment described above, except that atmospheric residue oil is subject to catalytic cracking, resulting in being separated into a light matter and a heavy matter. A treatment process for atmospheric residue oil includes a catalytic cracking unit 6 acting as catalytic cracking means which is first separation means for subjecting<br>

atmospheric residue oil to catalytic cracking using a catalyst, a gas turbine generating section 20 and a steam turbine generating section 30 each arranged at a rear stage of the catalytic cracking unit 6, and a flue gas desulfurization and/or denitrification unit 4 arranged at a rear stage of the steam turbine generating section 30. The gas turbine generating section 20, steam turbine generating section 30 and flue gas desulfurization and/or denitrification unit 4 may be constructed in substantially the same manner as those in the embodiments described above.<br>
The catalytic cracking unit 6 is constructed in such a manner that a mixture of atmospheric residue oil heated at, for example, about 300t in a heating furnace or a heater 11 and a catalyst fed from a catalyst feed section or a catalyst regenerator 60 is introduced through a lower portion of a riser or a cracking reactor 61 reduced in diameter thereinto together with carrier fluid such as, for example, oil vapor and steam and then upwardly guided through the riser 61 at an increased velocity. Then, the mixture is separated into the catalyst and steam in a catalyst disengager 62 formed into an increased diameter and connected to an upper end of the riser 61. The separation is carried out due to a sudden increase in sectional area by transfer or migration from the riser reduced in diameter to the disengager 62 increased in diameter. Then, the steam or cracked oil matter is subject to distillation in a main fractionator (atmospheric distillation column) 63. Thus, in the catalytic cracking unit 6, atmospheric residue oil is subject to cracking in the presence of the catalyst. Then, gasoline, gas oil, kerosene and slurry oil (SLO) contained in the cracked oil are separated from each other due to a difference in boiling point, wherein gasoline is recovered from an upper stage of the fractionator 63 and then treated together with a light matter obtained by atmospheric distillation means 1.<br>
Also, the gas oil and kerosene obtained in the catalytic cracking means 6 which correspond to a heavy matter (cracked oil) are recovered from an intermediate stage of the fractionator 63 and then fed as a fuel to a gas turbine 21.<br>
page15<br><br>
The SLO obtained in the catalytic cracking means which corresponds to a heavy matter (heavy oil or residue) is recovered from a bottom of the fractionator 63 and then fed to a filter unit (not shown), in which a catalyst included in the form of a fine solid in the SLO is removed therefrom, and then the SLO is fed as a heat source to a boiler section 31 together with high-temperature flue gas or exhaust gas discharged from the gas turbine. Thus, the illustrated embodiment permits power generation to be carried out in the gas turbine generating section 20 and steam turbine generating section 30 as in the embodiments described above.<br>
The illustrated embodiment is featured in that the atmospheric residue oil is subject to catalytic cracking, to thereby be separated into a light matter and a heavy matter. In the catalytic cracking unit 6, the catalyst is selected depending on properties of the atmospheric residue oil. A cracking reaction in the catalytic cracking is varied depending on properties of the atmospheric residue oil, a type of the catalyst selected, reaction conditions and the like. Thus, such parameters or factors are suitably determined as desired. The illustrated embodiment, as described above, is constructed so as to subject the atmospheric residue oil to catalytic cracking. Such construction permits gasoline of a high octane value to be recovered from the atmospheric residue oil. Also, it permits gas oil and kerosene reduced in commercial value as petroleum products because of containing much olefin aroma to be used as a fuel in the gas turbine generating section 20. Further, it permits SLO to be used as a fuel for the steam turbine generating section 30 after it is subject to the filtering treatment. This results in the illustrated embodiment carrying out a combination between production of gasoline and the combined cycle generation, so that the atmospheric residue oil may be effectively used as an energy source.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 5, a fourth embodiment of a combined cycle generating system according to the present invention is illustrated. A combined cycle generating system of the illustrated embodiment is constructed in substantially the<br>
page 16<br><br>
same manner as the embodiments described above, except that atmospheric residue oil is subject to vacuum distillation, to thereby be separated into a light matter and a heavy matter (vacuum residue oil) and then the light matter is subject to catalytic cracking, resulting in being separated into gasoline, light cycle oil (LCO) having a boiling point between kerosene and gas oil, heavy cycle oil (HCO) having a boiling point between kerosene and heavy oil, and slurry oil (SLO).<br>
In the illustrated embodiment, a treatment process for the atmospheric residue oil includes vacuum distillation means 10, a catalytic cracking unit 6 arranged at a rear stage of the vacuum distillation means 10, a gas turbine generating section 20 and a steam turbine generating section 30 ea h arranged at a rear stage of the catalytic cracking unit 6, and a sulfur recovery unit 4 arranged at a rear stage of the steam turbine generating section 30 so as to act as flue gas desulfurization and/or denitrification unit. The vacuum distillation means 10, the catalytic cracking unit 6, the gas turbine generating section 20 and steam turbine generating section 30, and the flue gas desulfurization and/or denitrification unit 4 may be constructed in substantially the same manner as those in the embodiments described above.<br>
In the illustrated embodiment, atmospheric residue oil is heated to a predetermined temperature in a heating furnace or a heater 11 and then subject to vacuum distillation in a vacuum distillation column under predetermined conditions, so that a light matter is obtained at a top of the vacuum distillation column 12, which is then fed to the catalytic cracking unit 6. In the catalytic cracking unit 6, gasoline is produced at or from an upper stage of a fractionator 63, and gas oil and kerosene are produced from an intermediate stage thereof and then fed as a fuel to a gas turbine 21. Also, a heavy matter is produced from a bottom of the fractionator 63 and then fed as a heat source to a boiler section 31 together with a heavy matter which is vacuum residue oil obtained at a bottom of the vacuum distillation column 12.<br>
The illustrated embodiment is featured in that the vacuum distillation and catalytic cracking are combined. The vacuum<br>
page 17<br><br>
residue oil is used as a heat source for the boiler section 31 and more specifically as a heat source for such a fuel combustion boiler as described above with reference to Fig. 2, resulting in being required to exhibit flowability to a degree. For this purpose, a distillation pressure and a distillation temperature for the vacuum distillation in the vacuum distillation column 12 are so determined that a vacuum residue has viscosity within a predetermined range . Also, the vacuum residue is fed to the boiler section 31 without being cooled after the vacuum distillation, so that a reduction in flowability of the vacuum residue may be minimized. Alternatively, SLO may be added to the vacuum residue increased in viscosity to adjust viscosity of the vacuum residue, followed by feeding of the vacuum residue to the boiler section 31. In addition, the illustrated embodiment may be constructed so as not to use the SLO obtained from the catalytic cracking means 6 as a fuel for the boiler section 31.<br>
Thus, in the illustrated embodiment, the atmospheric residue oil is subject to a combination of the vacuum distillation and catalytic cracking, to thereby be cracked. This permits production of gasoline and, combined cycle generation to be combined together, so that the atmospheric residue oil may be effectively available to increase power generation efficiency. In this instance, the illustrated embodiment may be so constructed that a hydrotreating unit may be arranged at a rear stage of the vacuum distillation column 12, resulting in a light matter obtained from the vacuum distillation column 12 being subject to a desulfurization treatment in the hydrotreating unit, leading to catalytic cracking of the light matter. The hydro-treating unit used herein may be constructed in substantially the same manner as the hydrodemetallization unit 53 described above. Further, a catalyst which exhibits a desulfurization function is present in the hydrotreating unit.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 6, a fifth embodiment of a combined cycle generating system according to the present invention is illustrated. A combined cycle generating system of the illustrated embodiment is constructed in substantially the<br>
page18<br><br>
same manner as the embodiments described above, except that atmospheric residue oil is separated into a light matter and a heavy matter through vacuum distillation means 10 acting as first separation means and then the heavy matter is subject to solvent extraction in solvent extraction means 50 acting as second separation means, to thereby be separated into deasphalted oil which is a soft matter (heavy light oil) and asphaltenes (raffinate) which is a heavy matter (heavy-yravity heavy oil), followed by feeding of the deasphalted oil to the gas turbine 21 together with the light matter obtained in the vacuum distillation means 10. The asphaltenes (raffinate) is used as a heat source for a boiler section 31. In this instance, oil for the gas turbine 21 may be constituted by either only the light matter obtained by vacuum distillation or a mixture of a main fuel in an amount of 50% or more consisting of the light matter with an auxiliary fuel in an mount of 50% or less consisting of the deasphalted oil. Alternatively, it may be constituted by either only the deasphalted oil or a mixture of a main fuel consisting of the deasphalted oil with an auxiliary fuel consisting of the light matter obtained in the vacuum distillation means 10. Further, two.or more such gas turbines 21 may be arranged, wherein one of the gas turbines 21 is fed with the light matter obtained by vacuum distillation and the other gas turbine is fed with the deasphalted oil.<br>
In the illustrated embodiment, the asphaltenes (raffinate) is required to exhibit flowability to a degree, so that a solvent extraction ratio is adjusted so as to permit the asphaltenes (raffinate) to have viscosity within a predetermined range. When efficiency of extraction in the solvent extraction means 50 is decreased, the asphaltenes (raffinate) produced in the solvent extraction column 51 may be used as a fuel for the boiler section 31 without arranging a slurrying treatment unit 13.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 7, a sixth embodiment of a combined cycle generating system according to the present invention is illustrated. A combined cycle generating system of the illustrated embodiment may be constructed in substantially the same manner as the above-described embodiments, except that<br>
page 19<br><br>
atmospheric residue oil is separated into a light matter and a heavy matter (vacuum residue oil) in vacuum distillation means 10 and then the heavy matter is subject to thermal cracking in thermal cracking means 80 which constitutes second separation means, resulting in being separated into a light matter and a heavy matter.<br>
The thermal cracking means 80 includes a heating furnace or a heater 81, a soaker drum 82 and an atmospheric distillation column 83. Vacuum residue oil produced in the vacuum distillation means 10 is heated to a temperature of, for example, 400 to 470°C, to thereby be separated into a light fraction and a heavy fraction by thermal cracking. In this instance, a cracking ratio of the vacuum residue oil may be adjusted or controlled depending on both a period of time during which the vacuum residue oil passes through the heating furnace 81 and a heating temperature. The soaker drum 82 acts as a liquid reservoir, so that the oil thus heat-treated in the heating furnace 81 is retained in the soaker drum 82, to thereby permit a period of time spent for the cracking to be significantly increased. The heat-treated oil discharged from the soaker drum 82 is then fed to the atmospheric distillation column 83 simplified in structure, so that the oil may be separated into a light matter or cracked gas oil and a heavy matter or cracked heavy oil.<br>
The cracked gas oil is fed as a fuel to a gas turbine 21 together with the light fraction produced in the vacuum distillation means 10 and the cracked heavy oil is fed as a heat source to a boiler section 31 together with high-temperature flue gas or exhaust gas discharged from the gas turbine 21. Thus, power generation takes place in a gas turbine generating section 20 and a steam turbine generating section 30 as in the embodiments described above. Any one of the cracked gas oil and the light fraction produced in the vacuum distillation means 10 may be solely used as a fuel for the gas turbine 21. Alternatively, any one of them may be used as a main fuel and the other may be an auxiliary fuel.<br>
Excessive thermal cracking of the vacuum residue oil causes a disadvantage of rendering the cracked oil unstable,<br>
page 20<br><br>
leading to precipitation of carbon and the like. In order to avoid such a problem, a heating temperature in the heating furnace 81 and retention time in the soaker drum 82 are determined so as to increase recovery of the cracked gas oil and restrain unstableness of the cracked oil.<br>
In the illustrated embodiment, as described above, a combination of vacuum distillation and thermal cracking is practiced for cracking the atmospheric residue oil. Thus, the illustrated embodiment likewise permits combined cycle generation to be attained using the atmospheric residue oil, so that the atmospheric residue oil may be effectively available as an energy source therefor, leading to an increase in power generation efficiency.<br>
Also, the illustrated embodiment may be so constructed that a vacuum distillation column is arranged at a rear stage of the atmospheric distillation column 83 of the heating means 80 to further subject cracked residue produced in the atmospheric distillation column 83 to vacuum distillation, so that a light matter of the residue may be used as a fuel for the gas turbine 21 and a vacuum residue oil may be fed as a heat source for the boiler section 31.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 8, a seventh embodiment of a combined cycle generating system according to the present invention is illustrated. A combined cycle generating system of the illustrated or seventh embodiment is constructed in substantially the same manner as the embodiments described above, except that atmospheric residue oil is separated into a light matter (cracked light oil) and a heavy matter (cracked heavy oil) by means of first separation means or thermal cracking means 80 which may be constructed in substantially the same way as those in the embodiments described above. Then, the cracked heavy oil is subject to vacuum distillation in second separation means or a vacuum distillation column 9, resulting in being further separated into a light matter and a heavy matter. More particularly, the atmospheric residue oil is heated in the thermal cracking means 80, to thereby be separated into cracked light oil and cracked heavy oil and then the cracked light oil is treated together with a light matter<br>
page 21<br><br>
produced by atmospheric distillation, to thereby be recovered as fuel oil. Alternatively, the cracked light oil may be fed as a fuel to a gas turbine 21.<br>
The cracked heavy oil is subject to vacuum distillation under predetermined conditions in the vacuum distillation column 9, to thereby be separated into a light matter and a heavy matter. The light matter is fed as a fuel to the gas turbine 21 and the heavy matter is fed as a heat source to a boiler section 31 together with high-temperature exhaust gas or flue gas discharged from the gas turbine 21.<br>
The illustrated embodiment is featured in that the atmospheric residue oil is subject to thermal cracking. In this respect, the light matter produced in the vacuum distillation column 9 is fed as a fuel to the gas turbine 21, therefore, viscosity of the light matter is desirably determined in view of injection properties of the light matter. Also, a vacuum residue is fed as a fuel to the boiler section 31, therefore, viscosity of the residue is desirably determined in view of flowability thereof. Thus, vacuum distillation in the vacuum distillation column 9 is desirably carried out while controlling a pressure of the distillation a,nd a temperature thereof so that viscosity of each of the light and heavy matters is within a predetermined range.<br>
In each of the embodiments described above wherein the atmospheric residue oil is separated into the heavy matter and light matter through the first separation means, the first separation means is constituted by the vacuum distillation means, solvent extraction means, catalytic cracking means or thermal cracking. Alternatively, the first separation means may be constituted by hydrocracking means which may be constructed in substantially the same way as the hydrodemetallization unit 53 described above with reference to Fig. 3. In this instance, a light matter produced in the hydrocracking means is fed as a fuel to the gas turbine 21 and a heavy matter produced in the hydrocracking means is fed as a heat source to the boiler section 31. Also, when the first separation means is constituted by the vacuum distillation means, the second separation means arranged at the rear stage<br>
page22<br><br>
of the first separation means is not limited to the solvent extraction means and thermal cracking means employed in each of the fifth and sixth embodiments and may be constituted by hydrocracking means. In addition, when the first separation means is the hydrocracking means, the second separation means may be constituted by catalytic cracking means.<br>
Further, when the first separation means and/or second separation means are any one of the catalytic cracking means, thermal cracking means and hydrocracking means, a part of a light oil or light distillate produced in the cracking means may be used as gasoline, kerosene or diesel oil. INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
Thus, it will be noted that the present invention is so constructed that atmospheric residue oil produced by subjecting feed oil such as residue oil produced in a petroleum refinery, crude oil or the like to distillation in the atmospheric distillation means is separated into a light matter or light oil (light distillate) and a heavy matter or heavy oil (residue), wherein the light matter is used as a fuel for the gas turbine generating section and the heavy matter and the high-temperature exhaust gas discharged from the gas turbine are used as a heat source for the steam turbine generating section. Such construction permits the atmospheric residue oil to be effectively used as an energy source, resulting in power generation being attained with increased efficiency.<br>
