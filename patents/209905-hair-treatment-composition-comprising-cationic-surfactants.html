The following specification describes the nature of this invention (and the manner in which it is<br>
to be performed)	<br><br><br>

HAIR TREATMENT COMPOSITION COMPRISING CATIONIC SURFACTANTS<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to hair treatment compositions and more particularly to conditioning hair rinses, which have the effect of cleansing and conditioning.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
One of the principal components in most cleansing products is a surfactant. Surfactants are used to remove dirt and debris and also to impart a foaming characteristic to the cleansing product which gives the consumer a perceived indication that the product is functioning as a cleanser.<br>
When washing the hair with conventional cleansing compositions, the natural oils are removed together with the dirt and unwanted oils. When too much of the natural oil is removed, for example, by especially frequent washing,, the hair becomes less easy to comb or style, and subject to static build-up causing "flyaway."  Furthermore, the use of such hair treatments as permanent waving, dyeing, teasing, and bleaching can adversely affect the physical condition of hair, as can atmospheric conditions, such as sunlight, which may cause photo-catalysed oxidation. These factors may result in hair with poor texture, which is difficult to manage and comb, whether wet or dry.<br><br><br>
Hair conditioners have been developed to try to restore the condition of the hair. These compositions are normally applied to hair after shampooing, left on the hair for a period of time and rinsed off. Products which improve the appearance, feel, and manageability of hair have gained increasing acceptance  and popularity with consumers.<br>
Accordingly, compositions which "condition" hair generally improve the manageability, appearance and feel of hair, by reducing dry static and increasing the ease of combing both wet and dry hair. Such conditioning products are well known.<br>
Many conditioning products contain long chain quaternary ammonium compounds combined with lipid materials, such as fatty alcohols. While such products have particularly good cosmetic in-use and rheologic characteristics, they may leave the hair greasy or oily, and subject to resoiling with dirt and sebum.<br>
In recent years, there have been attempts to incorporate higher levels of hair conditioning benefit agents into a cleansing surfactant-based product formulation to give the consumer the benefit of having one product with dual functions, for example, a shampoo with conditioner. The object of such "2-in-l" products is to optimise the deposition of the hair conditioning benefit agent onto the hair surface while maintaining both the maximum cleaning and lathering properties of the formulation.<br>
Problems arise when trying to combine a hair conditioning agent into a cleansing surfactant-based formulation, due to the competing functions of ingredients. For example, the use<br><br>
of one or more conditioning agents in a formulation may suppress the foaming characteristic of the surfactant. Also, reaction or complexation of the surfactant and the conditioning agent lowers the amount of surfactant available.<br>
Thus, when a conditioning agent such as a silicone, or a mineral or vegetable oil, is used in a formulation, normally the amount of surfactant in the formulation is increased so that the formulation will provide a level of foaming and cleansing which is acceptable to the consumer. However, increasing the amount of surfactant used in the formulation lowers the amount of conditioning agent deposited onto a surface. Thus, at high levels of cleansing surfactant the beneficial effect of the conditioning agent is lost. Conversely, if the level of surfactant is maintained then the level of conditioning agent must be lowered and, again, the beneficial effect of the conditioning agent is lost.<br>
It has now been discovered that hair conditioning formulations containing a particular combination of cationic surfactants, have improved hair care benefits while maintaining excellent in-use characteristics.<br>
Surprisingly, although formulations of the invention are based principally on cationic surfactant, and generally contain no anionic or amphoteric surfactant, they provide an acceptable level of cleaning and lathering whilst still conveying the wet slippy feel desired by consumers in connection with conventional hair conditioners. Furthermore, formulations of the invention also provide improved styling benefits to the hair.<br><br>

and, general formula (III) being:<br>

in which<br>
R1 is a linear or branched, preferably linear, saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbyl chain having from 5 to 30 carbon atoms, which is linked either directly to the quaternary nitrogen atom or via a functionalised link moiety such as an alkylester, alkylamido or an alkoxy, or combinations thereof;<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
As used herein, the term hydrocarbyl chain means an alkyl or alkenyl chain.<br>
Reference herein in the general formulas (II) to (VI) to the number of carbon atoms in the hydrocarbyl chain means the total number of carbon atoms, including, if present, those in<br><br>
any substituent groups on the hydrocarbyl chain and those in any linkage groups in the hydrocarbyl chain.  As will be evident from this definition, a substituent group containing carbon atoms may be viewed as a branching of the hydrocarbyl chain and thus may be referred to as a linkage in the hydrocarbyl chain.  This does not effect the calculation of the total number of carbon atoms in the hydrocarbyl chain.<br>
For the avoidance of doubt, the cationic surfactant (ii) only relates to monomeric quaternary ammonium compound, i.e. only contains a sungle quaternary nitrogen atom.<br>

Preferably, the compositions of the invention contain more than 1 wt%, more preferably at least 2 wt% and yet more preferably at least 5 wt% of water-soluble cationic surfactant (i) and/or- cationic surfactant (ii) in the composition.  Water-insoluble is taken to mean surfactant materials which do not form clear isotropic solutions when dissolved in water at greater than 0.2 percent by weight at 25°C.<br>
Lipid material<br>
The hair treatment composition of the present invention comprises, as a third essential component, a lipid material<br><br>
having at least one carbon chain of at least 16 carbon atoms in length.<br>
It is thought that inclusion of such a material enables the cationic surfactant (i) to be present in the composition as a disperse lamellar phase rather than in micellar form as it does in a simple aqueous solution.<br>
Lipid materials are essentially water-insoluble, contain hydrophobic and hydrophilic moeities, and include naturally or synthetically-derived acids, acid derivatives, alcohols, esters, ethers, ketones, and amides with carbon chains of at least 12, preferably at least 14, and more preferably from 16 to 22, carbon atoms in length.  Fatty alcohols and fatty esters are preferred; fatty alcohols are particularly preferred.<br>
Preferred fatty esters for use in compositions of the invention include cetyl palmitate and glycerol monostearate. Examples of suitable fatty alcohols are those fatty alcohols having at least 12, preferably at least 16 to 22, carbon atoms,, such as. lauryl, cetyl, steary1 and behenyl alcohols, and mixtures thereof, which themselves contribute to the overall conditioning properties of the composition.<br>
The total amount of lipid material in compositions of the invention may suitably range from 1 to 30%, preferably 2 to 20%, most preferably 5 to 15 by weight based on total weight of the composition, the amount being sufficient to convert the cationic surfactant (i) to the lamellar liquid crystal phase. The weight ratio of cationic surfactant (i) to lipid<br><br>
material is suitably from 10:1 to 1:10, preferably from 4:1 to 1:8, optimally from 1:1 to 1:7.<br>
Foaming Properties of the Composition<br>
Although compositions according to the invention are typically based primarily on cationic surfactants, their foaming power is excellent compared with conventional rinse-off hair conditioning compositions.<br>
The test-method which can be used to assess the foaming power of compositions according to the invention is the ASTM D 1173-53 test, also referred to as the Ross-Miles test, and described in J Ross and G D Miles, American Society for Testing Materials, 1953, pages 644- 646.<br>
Compositions according to the invention generally have a foam height of more than 20mm, preferably more than 50mm, more preferably more than 60mm, and most preferably more than 80mm, when measured by the foam height test described above.<br>
Product Form<br>
The compositions of the invention may suitably be in the form of a rinse-off conditioner, a leave-on conditioner or a conditioning mousse.<br>
Optional Ingredients<br>
Further surfactants such as anionic or amphoteric surfactants may be added as optional ingredients to<br><br>
compositions of the invention. Preferably, however, the total amount of anionic and/or amphoteric surfactant is no more than 6%, preferably no more than 4.5%, more preferably no more than 3%, by weight based on total weight of the composition.<br>
Compositions according to the invention can optionally include additional conditioning agents for hair such as silicones.<br>
Silicones are particularly preferred conditioning agents for hair.  Representative silicones include volatile and non¬volatile silicones, such as for example polyalkylsiloxanes (optionally end-capped with one or more hydroxyl groups) , polyalkylaryl siloxanes, siloxane gums and resins, cyclomethicones, aminofunctional silicones, quaternary silicones and mixtures thereof.<br>
Preferred silicones include polydimethylsiloxanes (of CTFA designation dimethicone), siloxane gums, aminofunctional silicones (of CTFA designation amodimethicone) and hydroxylated polydimethylsiloxanes- (of CTFA designation dimethiconol).<br>
Various methods of making emulsions of particles of silicones are available and are well known and documented in the art.<br>
Suitable silicone emulsions are commercially available in a pre-emulsified form. This is particularly preferred since the pre-formed emulsion can be incorporated into the composition by simple mixing.<br><br>
Examples of suitable pre-formed emulsions include emulsions DC2-1310, DC2-1865, DC2-1870, DC2-1766 and DC2-1784, available from Dow Corning. These are emulsions of dimethiconol. Siloxane gums are also available in a pre-emulsified form, which is advantageous for ease of formulation. A preferred example is the material available from Dow Corning as DC X2-1787, which is an emulsion of cross-linked dimethiconol gum.<br>
The amount of silicone incorporated into compositions for use according to the invention depends on the level of conditioning desired and the material used.  A preferred amount is from 0.01 to about 10% by weight of the total composition although these limits are not absolute.  The lower limit is determined by the minimum level to achieve conditioning and the upper limit by the maximum level to avoid making the hair and/or skin unacceptably greasy. We have found that an amount of silicone of from 0.5 to 1.5% by weight of the total composition, is a particularly suitable level.<br>
Compositions of the invention may also optionally include a viscosity enhancer.<br>
Examples of viscosity enhancers include:<br>
cellulose derivatives such as methylcellulose, hydroxymethylcellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose;<br><br>
water-soluble salts of cellulose ethers such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose and sodium carboxymethyl hydroxyethyl cellulose;<br>
natural gums such as carrageenan, xanthan gum, gum arabic, gum tragacanth and guar gum and derivatives thereof such as hydroxypropyl guar and guar hydroxypropyl trimonium chloride;<br>
inorganic thickeners such as colloidal magnesium aluminium silicate (Veegum), finely divided silica, natural clays such as bentonite and synthetic clays such as the synthetic hectorite available as Laponite(ex Laporte Industries Ltd);<br>
vinyl-type polymeric thickeners such as polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyvinyl alcohol, sodium acrylate/vinyl alcohol copolymers and carboxyvinyl polymers, such as those polytners of acrylic acid crosslinked with about 0.75% to 2.0% of polyallylsucrose or polyallylpentaerythritol, obtainable under the Carbopol trademark from B.F.Goodrich.<br>
As the viscosity enhancer, cellulose derivatives are particularly preferred, especially hydroxyethyl cellulose.<br>
Compositions of the invention in the form of a conditioning mousse will generally contain an aerosol propellant.  This agent is responsible for expelling the other materials from the container, and forming the mousse character .<br>
The propellant gas can be any liquifiable gas conventionally used for aerosol containers.  Examples of suitable<br><br>
propellants include dimethyl ether, propane, n-butane and isobutane, used singly or admixed.  Other examples of suitable propellants include nitrogen, carbon dioxide and compressed air.<br>
The amount of the propellant gases is governed by normal factors well known in the aerosol art.  For mousses the level of propellant is generally from about 2 to about 15%, optimally from about 4 to about 10%, by weight based on total weight of the composition.<br>
As further optional components for inclusion in compositions according to the invention may be mentioned the following conventional adjunct materials known for use in cosmetic compositions: emulsifiers, humectants, suspending agents, rheology modifiers, pearlescing agents, opacifiers, salts, perfumes, buffering agents, colouring agents, emollients, moisturisers, foam stabilisers, sunscreen materials, antimicrobial agents, preservatives, antioxidants, and natural oils and extracts.<br>
The invention' will now be further illustrated by the following, non-limiting Examples, in which all percentages are by weight based on total weight, unless otherwise stated.<br><br>

TEST METHODOLOGY<br>
The prototypes were applied and assessed by expert hairdressers in half head experiments (36 heads per test). A fixed quantity of each prototype was applied to the hairdresser to each side of the head.  The product was then used in accordance with a normal procedure.  The hairdresser assessed the panellists hair for a number of attributes and chose which side gave a greater sensation for each attribute or gave no selection.  After the treatment was complete the panellist also assessed their finished hair on some of the key attributes.<br><br><br>

Foam testing<br>
The formulations shown in the following Table were evaluated for foam height using the Ross Miles test as follows:<br>
The measurements were taken at room temperature.  A solution of 1 part test formulation to 9 parts water was prepared, any foam on the surface of the liquid was removed.  2 00ml of liquor was placed in both the upper and lower chambers.  The liquid was allowed to run from the upper chamber hitting the centre of the surface of the liquid in the lower chamber.  5 minutes after all the liquid had run through the foam height at four points around the chamber was recorded (and the average taken).  The equipment was cleaned and the measurement repeated a further two times for each of the test solutions.  An average of all three values was taken.<br>
The results of the testing are shown at the foot of the Table.<br><br>
