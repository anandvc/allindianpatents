FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a multi-compartment container system and assembly for separately storing two or more components in individual containers until ready fin-combining and mixing prior to use. This invention further relates to a multi-compartment container that may be used to dispense a predetermined amount of the content of the multi¬compartment container.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A multi-compartment container assemblies are known in the art where two or more individually scalable assembly units may be joined tog flier to assemble a multi¬compartment container. One condemn with such multi-compartment container assemblies is that at least one of the assembly units must be unsealed before other sealed assembly units can be attached to it to foam a multi-compartment container. Removing the seals during the assembly process introduce a potential risk of contaminating or spilling the contents of the assembly units.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a multi-compartment container system and assembly in which two or more individually scalable container assembly units can be assembled into a multi-compartment container while each of the assembly units remain sealed and later unsealed without disassembling the multi-cons ardent container system. One advantage of the multi-compartment assembly is that the sealed assembly units, can be assembled into a multi-compartment assembly while each of the assembly units remain sealed. Because the multi-compartment assembly can be assembled without unsealing the assembly units, any risk of contaminating the contents of each of the assembly units is minimized. The seals between the assembly units can subsequently be unsealed while in their assembled state so that the contents of the assembly units can be mixed into a formulation and then dispensed from the assembly.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, two assembly units are assembled together to form a two-compartment container, each of the assembly units forming a sealed compartment. Each of the assembly units have at least one sealed opening that engage one another to assemble the units into a two-compartment container. In this assembled state, sealing mechanisms sealing the at least one sealed opening of the assembly<br><br>
units may be adapted and configured to couple with one another. The coupling may be effectuated during the assembly of the container or subsequently at a later desired time. This coiq)ling configuration allow the sealing mechanisms of the two assembly units to unseal simultaneously when either one of the sealing mechanisms is axially displaced into an unsealed position. This establishes a flow-communication between the two assembly units allowing the contents of the two assembly units to be mixed.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the multi-compartment container system may be configured and adapted so that one of the compartments at the terminal ends of the assembly is measured to hold a predetermined amount of substance to be dispensed.<br>
The way which the sealing mechanisms of each of the two assembly units couple will now be illustrated in some specific embodiments but it will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that the same principle is also applicable to form containers with additional separate compartments. For example, in applications where more than two assembly units are assembled together to form a multi-compartment container having more than two compartments, the sealing mechanizing involved between any two assembly units may couple so that they may be unsealed simultaneously.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Some exaoqiles of the multi-compartment containers are provided to illustrate various q)acidic configurations and examples of the invention. The invention should not be regarded as being limited to these embodiments. The containers may also be eased for different uses, e.g., two or more compartment containers for medicinal formulations, dietary powders to be reconstituted with a liquid, alcoholic bevra'ages to form cocktails with other ingredients or various non
Fig. 1 illustrates a preferred embodiment of a two-compartment container assembly 100. The two-compartment container 100 is assembled from two assembly units: a dispensing unit 10 and a cartridge unit 30. Each of these assembly units are individually scalable containers that may be filled with a continent &amp;at may be sealed and stored in Them. The<br><br>
Fig. 2 illustrates the dispensing unit |10 and the cartridge unit 30 detached fichus one another as discrete assembly units. Both (if these assembly units 10,30 may be containers having sealable comings at top and bottom cods. A flange 12 provided tabs bottom end of the dispends unit 10 engages a rim .2 provided at the top raid of Ihe cartridge unit 30 when the divining unit 10 and the cartridge unit 30 are assembled into a two-conqiartment container 100. The diameters of the flange 12 and the rim 32 are such that they preferably engage to form a seal. The qua]|ity of the seal should be sufficiently tight for a given application for the container 100. In a preformed embodiments, however, the seal should be of such quality to kepi the contents elf the container from leaking and key any undesirable substances from entering the assembled container and possibly contaminating or conqnomising the quality of the onto of the container 100.<br>
la this illustrated example, the flange 12 has a larger diameter than the rim 32 and it fits over flies rim 32. But, the dispensing cartridge unit 30 may be configured with many other variety of structures to healingly engage one another to form a seal. The mating surface of the flange 12 and the rim 32 may be provided with raised sealing ridges that produce friction-fitted seal at the (nating metric. Alternatively, at least one of the maim surfaces may be provided with elastomeric seals to form compression seal at the mating interface.<br>
The bottom end of the dispensing un. 10 is Sealed with a sealing member 40 and the top end of the cartridge unit 30 is sealed top sealing wall 50. According to one embodiment of the present innovation, the sealing member 46 and the top sealing wall 50 ate configured and to coquille with one another when the top sealing wall 50 is axially displaced downwardly. So, as the top pointing of the cartridge unit 30 is unsealed, the sealing member 40 is also pulled downwardly ailing with the top sealing wall 50, theory unsealing the bottom end opening of the diftjiensing unit 10. The specific manners by which the two sealing mechanisms (the sealing remember 40 and the top sealing wall 50) couple may be achieved in a the scope of the present invention.<br>
For example; in the embodiment illustrated in Fig. 2, the sealing member 40 is provided with two or more coupling arms 45 on it. bottom surface, i.e., the surface facing the cartridge unit 30 when the dispensing unit 10 an(. the cartridge unit 30 are being assembled together. The top sealing wall SO of the u.iridge unit 30 is provided with its own set of two or more coupling aims 55 that corresj.nd to the coupling aims 45. The coupling arms 45,55 are arranged radically with space 45A, 55A between the coupling arms 45 and 55, respectively. When the dispensing unit 1(. and the cartridge unit 30 are brought<br><br>
together and assembled, the coupling aims 45,55 align with the spaces 55A, 45A, so that the cliquing aims 45,55 do not interfile with one another.<br>
Fig. 3 illustrates a detailed partial cutaway view of the dispels unit 10 and the coveting aims 45 can be seen in more detail. The coupling aims 45 have a J-show profile and protrude from the sealing member 40 with the top of the J-shaped coupling aims 45 being attached to the sealing member 40 with the bottom of the J-shaped coupling aims 45 foiming lading lodges 47. The dispensing unit 10 has two openings: a top opening 16 and a bottom opening 18. The top opening 16 may be sealed with a top sealing member 20. The bottom opening 18 is defined by a flange 12. The flange 12 may comprise an upper flange portion 12A and a low- flange portion 12B. A bottom sealing member 40 engages the xtpper flange portion 12A to seal the bottom opening 18 of the dispels unit 10. Preferably, Ibo bottom sealing member 40 and the spot flange portion 12A are configured to engage and form a seal. The bottom sealing member 40 may be a fiction-fitting plug, a 8nq)-fitting plug, or other sealing methods and mechanisms that will provide a seal with die necessary sealing quality. Of course die quality of the seal formed by die bottom sealing member 40 or any of the other seals in the container system will depend upon dieparticular implications, but in a prefeired embodiment of the present invention, the seals should at minimum keep the contents of the assonbly units from leaking and keep any undesired substances from entering the assembly units m.d possibly contaminating or compromising the quality of the contents of the assembly units.<br>
The seal formed at the top evening 16 by the top sealing member 20 is preferably of such quality drat die defending unit may be filled with either liquid or solid substances and also protect the contents of the dispensing unit from contamination during storage. The top sealing member 20 may be a screw c., a fiictioD-fitdng plug, a snap-fitting plug, a heat-sealed membrane, or sealing mode or mechanisms.<br>
Fig. 4 illustrates an exploded partial cutaway view of the cartridge unit 30 which may be engaged wide the dispensing unit 10 to form a two-compartment container. A multi- container system and assembly utilizing a cartridge unit such as the cartridge unit 30 is disclosed in detail in pending United States Patent implication No. 10/214,374, filed August 6,2002, and the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Cartridge unit 30 comprises a cartridge housing 31 with a top open 36 defined by a rim 32 and a displaceable member 56 provided witii the cartridge housing 31. The displaceable member 56 is axially displaceable within the cartridge unit's blousing 31 between a sealed position and an unsealed position. In its sealed position, the displaceable<br><br>
member's top sealing-wall 50 engages the rim 32 and seals the top opening 36. Mist unsealed position, the displaceable member 56 is axially displaced away from the rim 32 leaving &amp;e top opening 36 open. The bottom opening 38 of die cartridge unit 30 is defined by Ae bottom end of die displaceable unit 56 and it provides access to the internal space of the cartridge unit 30 so that the cartridge unit 30 may be filled Tithe its contents. The bottom opening 38 may be sealed witii any appropriate closure member 60. The closure member 60 may be a screw cap, a friction fitting plug, a snap-fitting plug, a heat-sealed membrane, or loafer sealing methods and mechanisms.<br>
When the cartridge unit 30 and the dispensing unit 10 are assembled, a rim 32 is inserted into a flange portion 12 of the dispensing unit 10. The rim 32 and fbc flange portion 12 are configured and adopted to form a seal that is of appropriate quality for a given application. The mating sources of the rim 32 and the flange portion 12 maybe provided with sealing ridges or other similar type of structures to produce a fijction-fitting seal at the mating inter&amp;ce. For example, the mating sur&amp;ces may be configured with an elastomeric material to form the seal, Alternatively, the rim 32 and the flange portion 12 may be provided with screw threads so that the dispensing unit 10 and the cartridge unit 30 may be screwed together for assembly.<br>
The dislikeable in ember 56 has a user manipulable portion 52 for axially displacing the displaceable member 56 between the sealed position and the unsealed position. To guide the axial motion of the displaceable member 56, the displaceable member 56 may be provided with one or more guide pins 54 and the cartridge housing 31 is provided with a corresponding number of guide slots 34 i the guide pins are situated. The number ofguide slots 34 and the guide pins 54 need not be equal. For example, more guide slots 34 than guide pins 54 may be provided. As illustrated in Figs. 1-4, the guide slots 34 are S-shaped with the terminal aids forming hori2»natal sections. By twisting the manipulable portion 52 about the longitudinal axis of the cartridge unit 30 in &amp;e direction indicated by arrow A on the manipulable portion 52 in Figs. 1 and 2, the guide pins 54 "Will follow  path of the guide slots 34 and the displaceable member 56 will move accordingly. Thus, displaceable member 56 will first just rotate about its longitudinal axis without any axial translation, then the displaceable member 56 will move in at least an axial direction (i.e., along die longitudinal axis of the cartridge unit 30).<br>
During the initial movement of the displaceable member 56 without any axial translation, the coupling arms 45,55 are brought into interlocking positions. Then during the axial modems of the despicable member 56, the top sealing wall 50 and file cotq)led sealing member 40 will both simultaneously unseal. The displaceable member 56<br><br>
is connected to the sealing wall 50 via one or more connecting member 58. And, in between the connecting members 58 are spaces 59 that allow the internal space of the cartridge unit 30 (defined by the displaceable unit 56) to communicate with tiie external environment through the top pong 36 when the displaceable unit 56 is in the unsealed posit oil<br>
Fig. 5 illustrates a detailed cutaway view of a fully assembled two-compartment container 100 whose assembly units are in sealed state. The lower flange portion 12B of tile dispels unit 10 and &amp;e rim 32 of the cartridge 30 are sealingly engaged. The bottom sealing member 40 is sealingly engaged to the viper flange portion 12A of the dispensing unit 10, sealing the bottom opening of the unit 10. The diqilaceable monger 56 is in its sealed position so that the top sealing wall 50 has sealingly engaged the top quieting of the cartridge unit 30 and die cliquing arms 45 and 55 are in an unlocked position. The bottom opening of the cartridge unit 30 is sealed with the closure member 60.<br>
Fig. 6 illustrates a detailed cutaway view of a fully assembled two-compartment container 100 whose assembly units have been unsealed so that the two cooqiartments are in communication with each other. The displaceable member 56 has been axially displaced to its unsealed position and hence the guide pin 54 is in its lower¬most position in the guide ski)t 34. The bottom sealing member 40 remains compiled to the top sealing wall SO of the cartridge unit 30 by the interlocked coupling aims 45 and 55. The bottom sealing member 40 has been pulled down by the downward axial displacement of the displaceable member 56 disengaging from the upper flange portion 12A.<br><br>
wiling aims 45 and SS are interdicted, and a user turns the amusable portion 52 of the cartridge unit 30 and moves the displaceable member 56 to the unsealed position, both the top sealing wall 50 of the cartridge unit 30 and the bottom sealing member 40 of the dispensing unit 10 will be unsealed and the internal spaces of the dispensing unit 10 and the cartridge emit 30 will be in flow-communication. Of course the strength of the coupling provided by interlocking of the coupling aims 45 and 55 should be sufficiently strong to be able to pull and unseal the bottom sealing member 40.<br>
The interlocking of the top sealing wall 50 and the bottom sealing membo-40 of the assembly units 30 and 10, respectftdly, allows the user to store each component of a formulation in sealed assembly units and assemble them into a container while keeping the assonbly units intact as sealed units in adept to prepare the simulation. Because the assembly units can remain intact as sealed units assoiling them into a container, the risk of contaminating the stored contents of the assembly units is minimized.<br>
In another embodiment of the container assembly 100, once the assembly units 10 and 30 are brought together, the dispensing unit 10 and the cartridge unit 30 may be twisted rotated about their longitudinal axis in opposite directions so that the cliquing arms 45 and 55 align with each other and interlock there locking ridges 47 and 57.<br>
In antifoam: embodiment of the container-assembly 100. each of the sealing mechanisms (sealing mambo' 40 and top sealing wall 50) may be provided with a single coiling arm on each of the sealing mechanisms. For example each sealing mechanisms may be provided with a arm that extends in a half circle.<br>
Fig. 6A illustrates yet another anbodimoit of the container assembly lOOA. In this embodiment, a lUsplaceable member 5iiA may be configured and adapted to prevent that member from being returned to its sealed position once it has been axially displaced to its unsealed position. For example, in addition to guide pins 54A, the displaceable member 56A may be provided with a second set of pins 51A dint is positioned closer to the bottom end of the displaceable member 56A so that when the dislikeable member 56A is axially displaced to its unsealed position, the pins 51A protrudes out below the cartridge housing 31A. The pins 51A are sufficiently tall to interfere with the cartridge housing 31A to prevent the displaceable member 5
 <br>
cartridge unit 30A of this embodiment is initially assembled, the pins 51A ace Such feature owned prevent an undesired reuse of the c(»trainer after its content has been dispensed.<br>
It word be obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art that the closure member 60 that seals the bottom opening 38 of the cartridge unit 30 may be configured and dated to take on a form similar to the bottom sealing member 40 of the dispends unit 10. For example, the douser member 60 may also be configured to have structures similar to the coupling arms 45 so that a second cartridge unit (not shown) may be engaged to the bottom end of the cartridge unit 30 adding a third compartment to the contact assembly 100.<br>
Similarly, any number of cartridge units may be assembled socially in this manner to form a multi-compartment container assembly having any desired number of commitments. Furthennore, a multi-compartment contain- assembly may be assembled by connecting two or more cartridge units in series without any dispensing unit Once the contest of the cartridges are mixed, whether they be Squids, powders, or combinations, the contents may be directly dispensed furlough the end opening of one of the two terminally located cartridges. In other words, the mixed content may be dispensed through the top opposing of the top cartridge or the bottom poem of the bottom cartridge. If a separate dispensing device were required by a particular application, an appoints dispends . device may be attached to the opening of the dispensing unit.<br>
B would be predated by one of armory dell in the art that ano&amp;er configuration of a multi-compartment container assembly may include <me or more of the cartridge units as described herein attached to both open ends a dispensing unit hi another embodiment disposing maybe bottle like container having only one opening. again may be in series such assemble multi-compartment assembly.></me>
Furthermore, according to one embodiment of the present invention, two or more cartridge units maybe assembled serially to assemble a multi-compartment container. Each of the cartridge units in the assembly constitutes a seated compartment holding a component of a formulation to be mixed. Once the contents of the container assembly have been mixed and are ready to be dispensed, the displaceable member of the tq)per-most cartridge unit in this assembly is moved to its unsealed position so that the mixed formulation can be dispensed trough the top opening of the upper-most cartridge miit. If necessary, djqiensing device, such as a baby feeding nipple, can be attached to foe top open of the upper-most cartridge unit.<br><br>
Fig. 7 illustrates a two-compaitment container assonbly 200 according to another embodiment of the present ideation where the container is assembled with a, diqjensing unit 210 and a cartridge unit 230. llie bottom aping 218 of the dispensing unit 210 has a smaller diameter than in the previously desorbed embodiments. The smaller diameter: of the bottom opening 218 may be more suitable for an application requiring filling the dispensing limit 210 with a pressurized component By reducing the size of the bottom opening, the sealing member 240 is accordingly smaller and thus the pressure exerted on the sealing manger 240 by the internal pressure can be reduced This minimizes the chance that the sealing member 240 might be pushed out of its sealed position before being assembled with a cartridge limit. The smaller dimmer sealing member 240 has a plurality of J-shaped coupling anns 245 on the side &amp;cling the cartridge unit 230. The displaceable unit 256 is provided with top sealing wall 250 that sealingly engages with rim 232 when the displaceable member 256 is in its sealed position. A plurality of J-sbapci coupling arms 255 is provide on the top sufficed of the top sealing wall 25K) for coupling with fba sealing member 240 by interlocking with the coiqling arms 245. In this embodimoit, the coupling arms 245 and 255 are provided as a plurality of aims, similar to the coupling arms 45 and 55 in the container 100, but the coiQ)]ing arms 245 and 255 an arranged in a circular formation with minimal spaces between each of the plurality of coupling arms. The actual number of arms provided for each group 245 and 255 may vary depending up
It would be obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art to provide the coupling arms 245 and 255 in other appropriate configurations. For example, the coupling arms 245 and 255 each may be solid circular structures.<br>
Figs. 8 illustrates another embodimmt of a two-compartment container assembly 300 where the coupling mechanism between the dispensing unit's bottom sealing<br><br>
member and the top sealing wall of the cartridge unit is provided in a different configuration. In this embodiment, the bottom sealing member 340 of the di.ensing unit 310 has an extension 343 diat protrudes downwardly and has an ellipticaUy shaped bottom end having two ends 345 that extend beyond the extension 343. The top sealmg wall 350 of die cartridge unit 330 has two coupling anns 355 that have a J-sh.ed profile. The coiQ&gt;ling arms 355 are located equidistant teem die center of the top sealing wall 350 with tfie hook-end of the J-diaped coupling aims 355 facing each other. The top opening of the dispensing, unit 310 is sealed with a screw cap 320.<br>
itg. 9 is a partial cutaway illustration of the fiilly assembled container assembly 300 and the coofiguration described above can be seen in more detaO. The bottom opening of tiie dispensing unit 310 is sealed with a sealing member 340. Ja this view, tiie dispensiiig unit 310 and the cartridge unit 330 have beoi assembled togeOier but the sealing member 340 and fbo top sealing wall 350 have not yet been coupled together. As ilhistrated, the dispensing unit 310 and the cartridge unit 330 are oriented so that the extenditig ends 345 of the ell.tical bottom end of the sealing m.nber 340 lie between the two coupling aims 355. To couple the sealing member 340 and the top sealing wall 350, the user would twist the dispensing Unit 310 and the cartridge unit 330 in opposite directions about the longitudinal axis of the assembly, thereby causing ttie extending ends 345 of &amp;e elliptical bottom end of the sealing member 340 to slide under the hook end of the J-sh.ed coapling arms 355.<br>
Fig. 10 illustrates the two-conqiartment container assembly 300 after the displaceable member 356 has been axially displaced to its unsealed position unsealing the coupled sealing member 340 and the top sealing wall 350. The top compartment 313 (defined by the internal space ottbs dispensmg unit 310) and the bottom compartmoit 333 (defined by die internal j.iace of the dieplaceable member 356) of the container assembly 300 are now in flow communication thiou. die bottom opening 318 of the dispensing unit 310. has been pulled out of is sealing position leaving the bottom opening 318 of the dispensing unit 310 qpeo. The bottom opening of the cartridge unit 330 is illustrated as being sealed with a closure member 360. As discussed previously in conjunction with the container assembly 100, in anofhor embodiment of die invention, the bottom end of the displaceable mocdber 356 of the cartridge unit 330 may be configured and adapted to have a structure similar to that of die bottom end of the dispensing unit 310. Thus, a second cartridge unit may be engaged to die bottom «id of the cartridge unit 330 to form a third compartment of the container assembly 300.<br><br>
h will be appreciated that the above desciiptioos are intended only to serve as examples, and that many other embodimoits aie possible and encompassed within the spirit and the scope of the present invention. The assembly units, cartridge units and the dispensing units, desoibed herein and illustrated in the figures are examples only. Assembly units embodying other variations of the structures described here are within the scope of the present invention. For example, a multi-compartment container system according to the present invention may be configured so that the dispraising unit is configured and adapted to hold a predetemiined amount of substance. Such contnner may be used to store a bulk volume of a substance in the other compartments and use the dispensing unit to measure a predetermined single dose of tiie substance for dispensing. The bottom sealing member of the dispensing unit may be opened by axially displacing the displaceable member of the cartridge unit that is attached to the dispensmg imit and let the contents of the cartridge unit fill the dispensing unit Next, the sealing member of the dispensing unit is reseated by axially displacing the displaceable member to its sealed position. The dispensing unit now is filled with a predetemiined amount of the substance that may be di.ensed through a separate dispensing opening on the top end of the dispensing unit<br><br><br>
