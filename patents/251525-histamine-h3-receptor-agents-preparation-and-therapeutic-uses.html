HISTAMINE H3 RECEPTOR AGENTS, PREPARATION AND THERAPEUTIC USES<br>
This patent application claims the benefit of United States Provisional Patent Application No. 60/696,257 filed July 1,2005.<br>
The present invention relates to novel aryl-methanone-pyrrolidinyl-methyl-pyrrolidinyl compounds, to pharmaceutical compositions comprising the compounds, to methods of treatment employing these compounds and compositions, and to intermediates and methods for making these compounds.<br>
The histamine H3 receptor is relatively neuron specific and inhibits the release of a number of monoamines, including histamine. The histamine H3 receptor is a presynaptic autoreceptor and hetero-receptor located both in the central and the peripheral nervous system. The histamine H3 receptor regulates the release of histamine and other neurotransmitters, such as serotonin and acetylcholine. These are examples of histamine H3 receptor mediated responses. Recent evidence suggests that the H3 receptor shows intrinsic, constitutive activity, in vitro as well as in vivo (i.e. it is active in the absence of an agonist). Compounds acting as inverse agonists can inhibit this activity. A histamine H3 receptor antagonist or inverse agonist would therefore be expected to increase the release of H3 receptor-regulated neurotransmitters in the brain. A histamine H3 receptor agonist, on the contrary, leads to an inhibition of the biosynthesis and or release of histamine, and other neurotransmitters, such as serotonin and acetylcholine. These findings suggest that histamine H3 receptor agonists, inverse agonists, and antagonists could be important mediators of neuronal activity, and the activities of other cells that may express this receptor. Inverse agonism or selective antagonism of the histamine H3 receptor raises brain levels of histamine, and other monoamines, and inhibits activities such as food consumption while minimizing non-specific peripheral consequences. By this mechanism, they induce a prolonged wakefulness, improved cognitive function, reduction in food intake, and normalization of vestibular reflexes. Accordingly, the histamine H3 receptor is an important target for new therapeutics in Alzheimers disease, mood and attention adjustments, cognitive deficiencies, obesity, dizziness, schizophrenia, epilepsy, sleeping disorders, narcolepsy and motion sickness.<br>
Histamine mediates its activity via four receptor subtypes, H1R, H2R, H3R and a newly identified receptor designated GPRv53 [(Oda T., et al., J.Biol.Chem. 275 (47):<br><br>
WO 2007/005503	PCT/US2006/025328<br>
3 <br>
36781-6 (2000)]. Alternative names for GPRv53 are PORT3 or H4R. Although relatively selective ligands have been developed for H1R, H2R and H3R, few specific ligands have been developed that can distinguish H3R from H4R. H4R is a widely distributed receptor found at high levels in human leukocytes. Activation or inhibition of this receptor could result in undesirable side effects when targeting antagonism of the H3R receptor. The identification of the H4R receptor has fundamentally changed histamine biology and must be considered in the development of histamine H3 receptor antagonists.<br>
Some histamine H3 receptor antagonists were created which resembled histamine in possessing an imidazole ring generally substituted in the 4(5) position (Ganellin et al., Ars Pharmaceutica, 1995,36:3,455-468). These imidazole-containing compounds have the disadvantage of poor blood-brain barrier penetration, interaction with cytochrome P-450 proteins, and hepatic and ocular toxicities. Recently other imidazole and non-imidazole ligands of the histamine H3 receptor have been described, such as those of WO 2002076925.<br>
There remains a need for improved treatments using alternative or improved pharmaceutical agents that act as histamine H3 receptor agonists, inverse agonists, or antagonists, to modulate H3 receptor activity, and treat the diseases that could benefit from H3 receptor modulation. The present invention provides such a contribution to the art based on the finding that a novel class of aryl-methanone-pyrrolidinyl-methyl-pyrrolidinyl compounds has a high affinity, selective, and potent activity at the histamine H3 receptor. The subject invention is distinct in the particular structures and their activities.<br>
The present invention provides a compound structurally represented by Formula I:<br><br>

Alternatively, wherein Z = SH, the thiol group can be converted to R1 by alkylation with an alkyl halide or methane sulfonyl alkyl ester. For example, 4-mercapto-benzoic acid methyl ester is treated with an alkylating agent, in this case methanesulfonic acid 3-pyridin-4-yl-propyl ester (prepared by sulfonylation of the alcohol) in a suitable<br><br>

solvent such as DMF in the presence of potassium carbonate and heated for 2-24 hours to yield 4-(3-pyridin-4-yl-propylsulfanyl)-benzoic acid methyl ester.<br>
In Scheme C, Step 2, the resulting esters (wherein Rb = Me, Et, Bz etc.), can be saponified using standard conditions to yield the corresponding carboxylic acids or the lithium, sodium or potassium salt of the acid where Ra can be H, Li, Na or K. For example, 3-(l-methanesulfonyl-piperidin-4-ylmethyl)-benzoic acid methyl ester is dissolved in a suitable solvent such as MeOH or dioxane and 1M LiOH is added. The reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature overnight or can be heated to 50 °C for 30 minutes to 18 hours. The solvent is removed in vacuo and the acid or salt isolated according to techniques well known in the art.<br>
In Scheme C, Step 3, the carboxylic acids or the corresponding lithium, sodium or potassium salts (wherein Ra=H, Li, Na, K) are converted to the pyrrolidinylmethylpyrrolidine amides by the methods described in Scheme A, Step 1.<br><br>
In Scheme D, Rc is an alkyl group such that C(O)NHRc = R1. In Scheme D, Step 1, the acid chloride is acylated with an alkyl group to give an amide.<br><br>

In Scheme D, Step 2, the methyl ester is converted directly to the pyrrolidine amide by treatment with l-(2-pyrrolodinylmethyl)pyrrolidine and trimethyl aluminum in a suitable solvent such as tetrahydrofuran. The mixture is stirred at ambient temperature for 2-24 hours to provide N-(3-piperidin-l-yl-propyl)-4-(2-(S)-pyrrolidin-l-ylmethyl-pyrrolidine-l-carbonyl)-benzamine.<br>

The optimal time for performing the reactions of the Schemes, Preparations, and Procedures can be determined by monitoring the progress of the reaction via conventional chromatographic techniques. The skilled artisan will appreciate that not all substituents are compatible with all reaction conditions. These compounds may be protected or modified at a convenient point in the synthesis by methods well known in the art. (For example, see: Greene and Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis. Third Edition, John Wiley and Sons Inc., 1999). Furthermore, it is preferred to conduct the reactions of the invention under an inert atmosphere, such as, for example, argon, or, particularly, nitrogen. Choice of solvent is generally not critical so long as the solvent employed is inert to the ongoing reaction and sufficiently solubilizes the reactants to effect the desired reaction. The compounds are preferably isolated and purified before their use in subsequent reactions. Some compounds may crystallize out of the reaction solution during their formation and then collected by filtration, or the reaction solvent may be removed by extraction, evaporation, or decantation. The intermediates and final products of Formula I may be further purified, if desired by common techniques such as recrystallization or chromatography over solid supports such as silica gel or alumina.<br>
Preferably the compound is administered orally. Preferably, the pharmaceutical preparation is in a unit dosage form. In such form, the preparation is subdivided into suitably sized unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the active components, e.g., an effective amount to achieve the desired purpose. The quantity of the inventive active composition in a unit dose of preparation may be generally varied or adjusted from about 0.01 milligrams to about 1,000 milligrams, preferably from about 0.01 to about 950 milligrams, more preferably from about 0.01 to about 500 milligrams, and typically from<br><br>
WO 2007/005503	PCT/US2006/025328<br>
--45-<br>
about 1 to about 250 milligrams, according to the particular application. The actual dosage employed may be varied depending upon the patient's age, sex, weight and severity of the condition being treated. Such techniques are well known to those skilled in the art. Generally, the human oral dosage form containing the active ingredients can be administered 1 or 2 times per day.<br>
The compositions of the invention may be formulated so as to provide quick, sustained or delayed release of the active ingredient after administration to the patient. Suitable dosage forms for sustained release include layered tablets containing layers of varying disintegration rates or controlled release polymeric matrices impregnated with the active components and shaped in tablet form or capsules containing such impregnated or encapsulated porous polymeric matrices.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts and common methodology for preparing them are well known in the art. See, e.g., P. Stahl, et al., HANDBOOK OF PHARMACEUTICAL SALTS: PROPERTIES, SELECTION AND USE, (VCHA/Wiley-VCH, 2002); S.M. Berge, et al, "Pharmaceutical Salts," Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Vol. 66, No. 1, January 1977. The compounds of the present invention are preferably formulated as pharmaceutical compositions administered by a variety of routes. Most preferably, such compositions are for oral administration. Such pharmaceutical compositions and processes for preparing same are well known in the art. See, e.g., REMINGTON: THE<br>
SCIENCE AND PRACTICE OF PHARMACY (A. Gennaro, et al, eds., 19 ed., Mack Publishing Co., 1995).<br>
Although a number of H3R antagonists are known in the art, none have proven to be satisfactory obesity or cognitive drugs. There is increasing evidence that histamine plays an important role in energy homeostasis. Histamine, acting as a neurotransmitter in the hypothalamus, suppressed appetite. Histamine is an almost ubiquitous amine found in many cell types and it binds to a family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This family provides a mechanism by which histamine can elicit distinct cellular responses based on receptor distribution. Both the H1R and H2R are widely distributed. H3R is primarily expressed in the brain, notably in the thalamus and caudate nucleus. High density of expression of H3R was found in feeding center of the brain. A novel histamine receptor GPRv53 has been recently identified. GPRv53 is found in high levels in peripheral white blood cells; only low levels have been identified in the brain by some<br><br>
WO 2007/005503	PCT/US2006/025328<br>
-46-<br>
investigators while others cannot detect it in the brain. However, any drug discovery effort initiated around H3R must consider GPRv53 as well as the other subtypes.<br>
The compounds of the present invention can readily be evaluated by using a competitive inhibition Scintillation Proximity Assay (SPA) based on a H3R binding assay using [3H] a methylhistamine as ligand. Stable cell lines, including but not limited to HEK can be transfected with cDNA coding for H3R to prepare membranes used for the binding assay. The technique is illustrated below (Preparation of Histamine Receptor Subtype Membranes') for the histamine receptor subtypes.<br>
Membranes isolated as described in (Preparation of Histamine Receptor Subtype Membranes') are used in a [35S]GTP S functional assay. Binding of [35S]GTF S to membranes indicates agonist activity. Compounds of the invention of Formula I are tested for their ability to inhibit binding in the presence of agonists. Alternately, the same transfected cell lines are used for a cAMP assay wherein H3R agonists inhibited forskolin-activated synthesis of cAMP. Compounds of Formula I are tested for their ability to permit forskolin -stimulated cAMP synthesis in the presence of agonist. A. Preparation H1R membranes:<br>
cDNA for the human histamine 1 receptor (H1R) is cloned into a mammalian expression vector containing the CMV promoter (pcDNA3.1(+), Invitogen) and transfected into HEK293 cells using the FuGENE Tranfection Reagent (Roche Diagnostics Corporation). Transfected cells are selected using G418 (500 µ/ml). Colonies that survived selection are grown and tested for histamine binding to cells grown in 96-well dishes using a scintillation proximity assay (SPA) based radioligand binding assay. Briefly, cells, representing individual selected clones, are grown as confluent monolayers in 96-well dishes (Costar Clear Bottom Plates, #3632) by seeding wells with 25,000 cells and growing for 48 hours (37°C, 5% CO2). Growth media is removed and wells are rinsed two times with PBS (minus Ca2+ or Mg2+). For total binding, cells are assayed in a SPA reaction containing 50mM Tris-HCL (assay buffer), pH 7.6, 1mg wheat germ agglutinin SPA beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, #RPNQ0001), and 0.8nM 3H-pyrilamine (Net-594, NEN) (total volume per well = 200µl). Astemizole (10µM, Sigma #A6424) is added to appropriate wells to determine non¬specific binding. Plates are covered with FasCal and incubated at room temperature for<br><br>

120 minutes. Following incubation, plates are centrifuged at 1,000rpm (~800g) for 10 minutes at room temperature. Plates are counted in a Wallac Trilux 1450 Microbeta scintillation counter. Several clones are selected as positive for binding, and a single clone (H1R40) is used to prepare membranes for binding studies. Cell pellets, representing -10 grams, are resuspended in 30ml assay buffer, mixed by vortexing, and centrifuged (40,000g at 4°C) for 10 minutes. The pellet resuspension, vortexing, and centrifugation is repeated 2 more times. The final cell pellet is resuspended in 30ml and homogenized with a Polytron Tissue Homogenizer. Protein determinations are done using the Coomassie Plus Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce). Five micrograms of protein is used per well in the SPA receptor-binding assay.<br>
