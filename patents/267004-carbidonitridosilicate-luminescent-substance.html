				<td>CARBIDONITRIDOSILICATE LUMINESCENT SUBSTANCES<br>
The present invention relates to inorganic luminescent<br>
materials capable of effectively absorbing high-energy<br>
excitation radiation and converting it with a high<br>
efficiency into a lower-energy emission radiation. UV<br>
radiation or blue light in particular is suitable as the<br>
excitation radiation, resulting in emissions in the green,<br>
yellow, orange and/or red range of the visible spectrum<br>
following conversion of the radiation.<br>
It has long been known that inorganic luminescent<br>
substances may be used to advantage to visualize invisible<br>
radiation images (e.g., in radiological diagnostics or<br>
display technology) and also for the purpose of general<br>
illumination (e.g., in fluorescent lamps or to produce<br>
white LEDs). Such luminescent substances usually have a<br>
host lattice doped with special elements. So far mostly<br>
sulfides, halides and oxides have been used as the host<br>
lattice for such luminophores in industrial applications<br>
but also to a particularly great extent, complex salts of<br>
oxygen-containing acids (borates, aluminates, silicates,<br>
phosphates, molybdates, tungstates, etc.) are used.<br>

M :- C, 3i, Ge, 3n, Ti, Zr , Hf and K at: rare earth metal<br>
Only in recent years has it also been possible to develop<br>
nitridic materials (such as the red-emitting compounds of<br>
the type M2Si5N5::i;u2+ where M = Ca, Sr, Ba described by<br>
Hintzen et al. in EP I 104 799 Al and EP 1 238 041 Bl, for<br>
example) and oxynitridic materials (examples include the<br>
blue, green and yellow-emitting europium- or cerium-doped<br>
MSi202N2 compounds according to Delsing et al. in<br>
WO 2004/030109 Al; M = Ca, Sr, Ba) as the host lattice for<br>
synthesis of efficient luminescent substances. The interest<br>
in such luminophores has since then grown to a great<br>
extent, especially in conjunction with their advantageous<br>
use as conversion luminescent substances for the production<br>
of white LEDs. This is attributed in particular to the fact<br>
that because of the high covalency of the chemical bonds<br>
and the proven marked rigidity of the basic lattice, a<br>
particularly high chemical and thermal stability is<br>
expected of materials of this type. The disadvantages of<br>
the mostly sulfidic and oxygen-dominated conversion<br>
luminescent substances is mainly that their luminescence<br>
ft<br>
efficiency usually declines very rapidly at temperatures<br>
above 100°C. However, for the production of more advanced<br>
white LEDs with a higher wattage, conversion luminescent<br>
substances with a greatly improved thermal stability are<br>
needed.<br>
On the other hand, it should be pointed out in this context<br>
that all the inorganic conversion luminescent materials<br>
currently used industrially (yttrium aluminates,<br>
thiogallates, alkaline earth sulfides, alkaline earth<br>
silicates, nitrides, oxynitrides) which are used to produce<br>
white light in combination with blue-emitting LEDs, are<br>
without exception Eu2+ and/or Ce3+-activated systems with an<br>
extremely broadband emission. Electronic 5d-4f transitions<br>
which may easily be influenced by an external crystal field<br>
and thus naturally also by extinction centers that may be<br>
present are characteristic of such luminescent substances.<br>
The situation is fundamentally different than that when<br>
using luminophores in fluorescent lamps. In this case, the<br>
main substances used as red and green components are lineemitting<br>
luminescent substances in which the luminescence<br>
phenomena to be observed are attributed to transitions<br>
between the 4f electrons (4f-4f transitions) that are<br>
shielded with respect to the effects of external crystal<br>
fields.<br>
High covalent bonding components are also characteristic of<br>
another class of compounds only recently discovered. These<br>
are the carbidonitridosilicates containing rare earth<br>
metals and/or alkaline earth metals. The first<br>
representatives of this class of materials (e.g., the<br>
compounds Ho2Si4N6C, Tb2Si4NeC (cf. Hoppe et al., J. Mater.<br>
Chem 11 (2001) 3300) and (La,Y,Ca)2(Si, Al)4 (N, C), (cf. Lindel<br>
et al., J. Eur. Chem Soc. 25 (2005) 37) have been<br>
synthesized and described with respect to their basic<br>
physicochemical properties.<br>
Information about the luminescence of such compounds has so<br>
far been completely unavailable in the technical<br>
literature. Now, however, SCHMIDT et al. have presented<br>
cerium-activated carbidonitridosilicate materials, in<br>
particular luminescent substances having the composition<br>
Y2Si4NeC:Ce with an activator concentration of 5% Ce in the<br>
patent WO 2005/083037 Al, which was published after the<br>
priority date of the present application. On excitation<br>
with UV radiation or with the light of blue-emitting LEDs,<br>
these materials luminesce in a broadband in the yellow<br>
spectral range and, according to the published information,<br>
have practically the same performance data with regard to<br>
quantum yield, absorption efficiency and temperature<br>
characteristics as the corresponding parameters of other<br>
known yellow-emitting conversion luminescent substances<br>
such as yttrium aluminum garnets, which are also doped with<br>
cerium, or Eu2+-activated alkaline earth orthosilicates.<br>
However, the object of the present invention is to propose<br>
novel ^uminescent materials, in particular for use in<br>
efficient white LEDs, which are characterized by original<br>
or improved luminescence properties.<br>
This object is achieved by the luminescent substances<br>
defined in the attached Patent Claims 1 and 2.<br>
The inventive materials belong to the class of<br>
carbidonitrides, in particular carbidonitridosilicates.<br>
They may be used alone or in combination with other<br>
suitable luminophores as conversion luminescent substances<br>
for the production of light sources, in particular for the<br>
production of white-emitting LEDs.<br>
The insertion of carbon ions into the corresponding<br>
nitridosilicate matrix is associated with a further<br>
increase in the covalence of the lattice. Based on this<br>
fact, the lower tendency toward thermal extinction of the<br>
luminescence, the high chemical and thermal stability and<br>
the low tendency toward aging can be mentioned as special<br>
advantages of the inventive luminescent substances.<br>
A general formula for the luminescent substances according<br>
to the present invention would be:<br>
Ln(2-a-b+f)M (a+b-f )Si (4-c-d-e-f )M (c+d+e + f) N , 6-a+b-d+e) 0 (a + d) Cl-b-et<br>
where Ln denotes at least one of the metals indium<br>
(In), scandium (Sc), yttrium (Y) and for the rare<br>
earths, in jparticular for the elements lanthanum (La),<br>
gadolinium (Gd) and luthetium (Lu) and/or for mixtures<br>
of these metals.<br>
As shown in the general formula, however, in a special<br>
embodiment, Ln may also be replaced partially or entirely<br>
by a divalent metal M1, preferably by zinc (Zn) or by<br>
alkaline earth metals such as magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca),<br>
strontium (Sr) and barium (Ba) if equimolar amounts of<br>
nitrogen (N) are to be replaced by oxygen (0) or if carbon<br>
(C) is to be replaced by nitrogen (N).<br>
In yet another modification of this embodiment, silicon<br>
(Si) may be replaced by a component M11, e.g., by germanium<br>
(Ge) and/or boron (B) and/or aluminum (Al). In the last<br>
cases mentioned, equimolar amounts of N must also be<br>
replaced by 0 or equimolar amounts of C must be replaced by<br>
N or equimolar amounts of M1 must be replaced by Ln.<br>
Depending on the exact composition of the basic lattice of<br>
luminescent material, different crystal structures with<br>
different lattice sites for the incorporation of rare earth<br>
and/or transition metal activator ions can be implemented.<br>
Preferred activators include cerium and/or terbium and<br>
europium or certain transition metal elements that may be<br>
incorporated into the matrix as divalent ions (in<br>
particular Eu2+) or trivalent ions (in particular Ce3+, Tb3+,<br>
Eu3+) .<br>
The concentration of activators may be 0.001 to 1.5 mol<br>
activator per mol luminescent substance. The cerium which<br>
is optionally added as a coactivator may be present in<br>
concentrations of 0.0005 to 1.5 mol cerium per mol<br>
luminescent substance.<br>
Preferred embodiments of the inventive luminescent<br>
substances are determined by the following formulas:<br>
each with Ln = Y, La, Gd and/or Lu, where 0.001 
and 0.001 
The inventive luminescent substances emit a green, yellow,<br>
orange or red-colored luminescent radiation when excited in<br>
the UV spectral range (200 to 380 nm) and/or in the violet<br>
spectral range (380 to 420 nm) or in the blue spectral<br>
range (420 to 480 nm). They have an absorption for the<br>
excitation radiation and are also characterized by a high<br>
quantum efficiency and a low thermal luminescence<br>
extinction.<br>
Because of these features and additional advantageous<br>
properties, the inventive luminescent substances may be<br>
used advantageously both as individual components and as a<br>
mixture of several inventive luminescent substances or in<br>
combination (mixture) with other known blue, green, yellow<br>
or red-emitting conversion luminescent substances for the<br>
production of white LEDs.<br>
With the present invention, efficient rare-earth-activated<br>
luminescent substances with 4f-4f line spectra that can be<br>
excited in the blue spectral range are made available for<br>
the first time for the production of white LEDs, because it<br>
has surprisingly been found that simultaneous doping of<br>
certain inventive carbidonitridosilicate luminescent<br>
substance basic lattices with terbium and cerium ions leads<br>
to a green Tb3+ line emission that is excitable with the<br>
light of blue LEDs. Rare-earth-activated luminophores with<br>
4f-4f line emissions have the advantages described above<br>
with respect to resistance to the effects of external<br>
crystal fields and extrinsic extinction factors. In<br>
addition, when using the inventive Ce3+--Tb3+-codoped<br>
carbidonitridosilicate luminescent substances as the green<br>
component in white LEDs, however, even more advantages can<br>
be utilized. First, the main peak of the Tb3+ emission,<br>
which is located at approx. 545 nm, has an extremely low<br>
half-value width in comparison with the corresponding<br>
broadband spectra; secondly, the emission spectrum consists<br>
of additional line groups which are distributed over the<br>
entire visible spectral range. The property mentioned first<br>
is advantageous when using corresponding white LEDs for<br>
background lighting of LCDs (adaptation of the emission<br>
characteristics to the color filters used), while the<br>
characteristic spectral distribution of the luminescence of<br>
the Ce3+-Tb3+-coactivated luminescent substances, which is<br>
variable within certain limits (by varying the Ce/Tb ratio)<br>
contributes toward achieving improved color reproduction<br>
values (CRI = color rendering index) in the case of use in<br>
white LEDs for general lighting.<br>
Another importan-; advantage of the inventive approach may<br>
be seen in the fact that a novel red-emitting conversion<br>
luminescent substance can be synthesized in this way. Much<br>
stronger crystal fields can be implemented in inorganic<br>
nitride compounds than in the case of the oxygen-dominated<br>
luminescent substances. This is an important prerequisite<br>
for the desired :red shift of the luminescence emitted by<br>
Eu2+ ions, for example.<br>
The experiments conducted in conjunction with the present<br>
invention have now surprisingly shown that even in doping<br>
the inventive basic lattice with europium ions, redemitting<br>
luminescent substances are formed with excitation<br>
spectra that are suitable for use in white LEDs.<br>
Additional details, advantages and embodiments of the<br>
present invention are derived from the description of the<br>
manufacturing conditions for the luminophores as well as<br>
the accompanying figures, in which:<br>

europium-activated Y2Si4NeC luminescent material.<br>
The carbidonitridosilicates containing the rare earth<br>
metals and/or alkaline earth metals as defined in the<br>
general formula given above are preferably produced by a<br>
high-temperature solid-state reaction. The details of the<br>
synthesis are described below as an example on the basis of<br>
a general preparation procedure and two exemplary<br>
embodiments for Ce- and Tb-doped and/or Eu-doped<br>
carbidonitridosilicate luminescent substances.<br>
As starting materials, "-SllNi- l'-Si,.N|, carbon powder, SiC and<br>
the rare earths yttrium, cerium, terbium and europium are<br>
each used in metallic form. Before performing additional<br>
process steps, the rare earth metals are first nitrated in<br>
a nitrogen or ammonia atmosphere. Then the nitrated<br>
compounds are weighed in the respective stoichiometric<br>
amounts together with SiaN,), SiC or carbon powder and mixed<br>
thoroughly. Because of the moisture sensitivity of some<br>
starting materials, all these manipulations are performed<br>
in a glovebox under dry nitrogen. The powder mixtures are<br>
placed in suitable crucibles and calcined for 2 to 48 hours<br>
at temperatures of 1500°C to 1800°C in high-temperature<br>
ovens under pure nitrogen. After the end of the calcining<br>
process, the samples are cooled to room temperature and<br>
optionally subjected to a suitable af te:rtreatment.<br>
Example 1<br>
For preparation of the terbium- and cerium-activated<br>
carbidonitridosilicates Y1.0oSi4N6C : Tbo.ggCeo.ou terbium metal<br>
is first nitrated for 12 hours at 1200°C in a horizontal<br>
tubular oven under a pure nitrogen atmosphere to yield TbNx<br>
(&gt;• -0.99).<br>
The starting materials 34.24 g TbNx, 17.78 g yttrium metal,<br>
0.28 g cerium me~al, '"•-"' '3 « 3 s M and 8_Q 2 g sic are then<br>
mixed thoroughly in an agate mortar under a dry nitrogen<br>
atmosphere and then placed in a molybdenum crucible. This<br>
powder mixture is then calcined for 10 hours at 1600°C<br>
under pure nitrogen and next cooled to room temperature in<br>
the oven. After removing soluble components and those that<br>
have not reacted,, there remains a green-emitting<br>
luminescent substance having the composition<br>
Example 2<br>
To produce a carbidonitridosilicate activated with 5%<br>
europium and having the composition Gdi.8Sro.2Si4N6.2Co.8» pure<br>
strontium metal and europium metal are nitrated to the<br>
precursors Sr3N2 and EuN at 850°C for two hours under a pure<br>
nitrogen atmosphere in a horizontal tubular oven. Then<br>
56.61 g gadolinium metal, 2.91 g Sr3N2, 1.66 g EuN, 29.93 g<br>
«-.'•:i-H. and 6 .42 g SiC are mixed thoroughly in a dried<br>
nitrogen atmosphere and placed in a thermally resistant<br>
crucible. The mixture is calcined for 24 hours at 1750°C in<br>
a nitrogen-hydrogen atmosphere (90:10). After suitable<br>
sample workout, a substance with an efficient red<br>
luminescence is obtained.<br>
The accompanying figures are mostly self-explanatory for<br>
those skilled in the art of luminescent substances. The<br>
basic information has already been presented above. As<br>
supplementary information, only a few particulars are given<br>
below.<br>
Fig. 1 shows that Y2Si4N6C luminescent substances doped only<br>
with cerium ions will luminesce in the yellow-green<br>
spectral range when excited with radiation between 360 and<br>
450 nm. The various curves are each based on different<br>
doping concentrations whose values are shown in the<br>
diagram.<br>
Fig. 2 shows that Y2Si4N6C luminescent substances activated<br>
with Tb3+ alone must be excited in the range between 280 and<br>
320 nm to achieve an efficient green Tb3+ line emission.<br>
Fig. 3 shows well that a Ce- and Tb-codoped Y2Si4N6C host<br>
lattice can also be excited efficiently in the range<br>
between 360 and 450 nm. In the selected example, this<br>
results in a Tb3+ line emission superimposed on the Ce3*<br>
broadband emission. However, Ce/Tb concentration ratios at<br>
which the terbium line emission is definitely predominant<br>
and the cerium luminescence is greatly suppressed can also<br>
be found.<br>
Finally, Fig. 4 shows that even the emission band of the<br>
europium-activated Y2Si4N6C matrix recorded at a maximum<br>
wavelength of 613 nm can be excited in the range of 350 to<br>
480 nm that is of interest.<br>
Although only a few embodiments have been described here in<br>
greater detail, it will be clear to those skilled in the<br>
art that numerous modifications of the inventive<br>
luminescent substance are possible. The possible variations<br>
have been indicated by providing equations of general<br>
