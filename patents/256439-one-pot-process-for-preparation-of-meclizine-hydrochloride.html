The reaction sequence in the manufacturing process of the present invention involves bromination, condensation, purification and hydrochloride formation, wherein the entire process is carried out without isolating the intermediates in the stages 1, 2 and 3 thus making overall process facile and operated in One-pot.  <br><br>
This invention also, narrates the method to eliminate dimeric impurity 1 which gets inevitably formed in the manufacture of Meclizine hydrochloride by chemical treatment. The formation of said impurity has been further confirmed by its synthesis and subsequent HPLC analysis, wherein this impurity matches with the one present in Crude API. Thus, the invention has aimed to eliminate the dimeric impurity formation by preparing the 3-methyl benzyl bromide substantially free from dibromo compound of formula HI.<br>
Accordingly. Meclizine Hydrochloride {l-[(4-chlorophenyl) phenyl-methyl]-4-[(3-methylphenyl) methyl] piperazine Hydrochloride} is prepared by bromination of m-xylene using brominating agent and a radical initiator, which gives in situ bromo compound of formula II, which on condensation with 4-chloro benzhydryl piperazine in presence of acid acceptor in m-xylene as solvent yields Meclizine Base. Meclizine base thus formed is treated with aqueous citric acid to eliminate dimeric impurity along with unreacted starting materials. Meclizine base is further reacted with Hydrochloric Acid gives Meclizine Hydrochloride J l-[(4-chIorophenyl) phenyl-methyl]-4-[(3-methylphenyl) methyl] piperazine Hydrochloride].<br>
The bromination is carried out at temperature of 50Â° to I00Â°C, preferably between 50Â° to 70Â°C and the brominating agent is N-Bromo succinimide. The radical initiator used is selected from AIBN, Benzoyl Peroxide, 2.2'-azobis(2-aminopropane)dichloride (Vazo 50), 2, 2'-azobis{2-methyl-N-! 1,1- bis (hydroxymethyl)-2-hydroxyethyl] propionamide (Vazo 80), more preferably AIBN.<br>
The bromination is carried out in aromatic hydrocarbon solvents, selected from Toluene, Benzene, Xylene or combination thereof but, more preferably m-Xylene.<br>
The step of in situ N-alkylation of 4-chloro benzhydryl piperazine is carried out at 0Â° to 50Â°C, more preferably at 30Â° to 40Â°C in the presence of acid acceptor.<br>
The acid acceptor is selected from alkali metal salts such as potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate, potassium bicarbonate, sodium bicarbonate.<br><br><br>
The N-alkylation is carried out in aromatic hydrocarbon solvents. CI to C4 alcohols, Ketones, Ethers, or combination thereof, more preferably m-Xylene.<br>
Hydrochloride formation is carried out after the Meclizine Base formed, is purified by<br>
repeated washing with aqueous citric acid.<br>
After washing with aqueous citric acid, the organic layer is washed with water, before<br>
proceeding to salt formation.<br>
It is necessary to introduce purification process to take care of carryover impurities like<br>
side product and starting materials in desired product. Introduction of aqueous citric acid<br>
washing in purification of base in present invention is to restrict impurities like starting<br>
materials and dimer impurity.<br>
The dimeric salt seems to be preferential citric acid salt forming ability as compare to<br>
parent Meclizine. This adduct forms a solid mass which can be removed by simple<br>
filtration. This chemical operation does the job of purification of Meclizine making it<br>
substantially lower with dimeric impurity.<br>
The Hydrochloride formation is carried out using aqueous Hydrochloric acid or mixture of IPA and Hydrochloric acid having different strength or by passing HCI gas.<br>
