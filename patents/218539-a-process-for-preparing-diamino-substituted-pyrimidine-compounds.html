				<td>A PROCESS FOR PREPARING DIAMINO SUBSTITUTED PYRIMIDINE COMPOUNDS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION <br>
The present invention relates to pyrimidine derivatives, salts and solvates<br>
thereof as well as a process for preparing the same. In particular, the present<br>
invention relates to diamino substituted pyrimidines, anhydrous, hydrated and salt<br>
forms thereof, as well as processes for preparing the same.<br>
The process of angiogenesis is the development of new blood vessels from<br>
pre-existing vasculature. Normal angiogenesis is active during tissue growth from<br>
embryonic development through maturity and then enters a period of relative<br>
quiescence during adulthood. Normal angiogenesis is also activated during wound<br>
healing, and at certain stages of the female reproductive cycle. Inappropriate or<br>
pathological angiogenesis has been associated with several disease states including<br>
various retinopathies, ischemic disease, atherosclerosis, chronic inflammatory<br>
disorders, and cancer. The role of angiogenesis in disease states is discussed, for<br>
instance, in Fan et al, Trends in Pharmacol Sci. 16:54-66; Shawver et al, DDT Vol. 2, No.<br>
2 February 1997; Folkmann, 1995, Nature Medicine 1:27-31.<br>
Central to the process of angiogenesis is vascular endothelial growth factor<br>
(VEGF) and it"s receptors, termed vascular endothelial growth factor receptor(s)<br>
(VEGFRs). The roles VEGF and VEGFRs play in the vascularization of solid tumors,<br>
progression of hematopoietic cancers and modulation of vascular permeability have<br>
drawn great interest in the scientific community. VEGF is a polypeptide, which has<br>
been linked to inappropriate or pathological angiogenesis (Pinedo, H.M. et al The<br>
Oncologist, Vol.5, No. 90001, 1-2, April 2000). VEGFR(s) are protein tyrosine kinases<br>
(PTKs) that catalyze the phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues in proteins that<br>
are involved in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, and survival. (A.F. Wilks,<br>
Progress in Growth Factor Research, 1990, 2, 97-111; S.A. Courtneidge, Dev. Supp.l,<br>
1993, 57-64; J.A. Cooper, Semin. Cell Biol., 1994, 5(6), 377-387; R.F. Paulson, Semin.<br>
Immunol., 1995, 7(4), 267-277; A.C. Chan, Curr. Opin. Immunol., 1996, 8(3), 394-401).<br>
Of particular interest is VE6FR2, which is a transmembrane receptor PTK<br>
expressed primarily in endothelial cells. Activation of VEGFR-2 by VEGF is a critical<br>
step in the signal transduction pathway that initiates tumor angiogenesis. VEGF<br>
expression may be constitutive to tumor cells and can also be upregulated in response<br>
to certain stimuli. one such stimulus is hypoxia, where VEGF expression is upregulated<br>
in both tumor and associated host tissues. The VEGF ligand activates VEGFR2 by<br>
binding to its extracellular VEGF binding site. This leads to receptor dimerization of<br>
VEGFRs and autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues at the intracellular kinase<br>
domain of VEGFR2. The kinase domain operates to transfer a phosphate from ATP to<br>
the tyrosine residues, thus providing binding sites for signaling proteins downstream<br>
of VEGFR-2 leading ultimately to angiogenesis. (Ferrara and Davis-Smyth, Endocrine<br>
Reviews, 18(1):4-25, 1997; McMahon, G., The Oncologist, Vol. 5, No. 90001, 3-10, April<br>
2000.)<br>
Consequently, antagonism of the VEGFR2 kinase domain would block<br>
phosphorylation of tyrosine residues and serve to disrupt initiation of angiogenesis.<br>
Specifically, inhibition at the ATP binding site of the VEGFR2 kinase domain would<br>
prevent binding of ATP and prevent phosphorylation of tyrosine residues. Such<br>
disruption of the pro-angiogenesis signal transduction pathway associated with<br>
VEGFR2 should therefore inhibit tumor angiogenesis and thereby provide a potent<br>
treatment for cancer or other disorders associated with inappropriate angiogenesis.<br>
The present inventors have discovered diamino substituted pyrimidines, salts<br>
and solvates thereof as well as processes for making the same. Such pyrimidine<br>
derivatives are inhibitors of VEGFR2 activity and are useful in the treatment of<br>
disorders, including cancer, associated with inappropriate angiogenesis.<br>

such polymorphic forms ("polymorphs") are within the scope of formula (I).<br>
Polymorphism generally can occur as a response to changes in temperature or<br>
pressure or both and can also result from variations in the crystallization process.<br>
Polymorphs can be distinguished by various physical characteristics known in the art<br>
such as x-ray diffraction patterns, solubility, and melting point.<br>
As used herein, the term "substituted" refers to substitution with the named<br>
substituent or substituents, multiple degrees of substitution being allowed unless<br>
otherwise stated.<br>
Certain of the compounds described herein may contain one or more chiral<br>
atoms, or may otherwise be capable of existing as two enantiomers. Accordingly, the<br>
compounds of this invention include mixtures of enantiomers as well as purified<br>
enantiomers or enantiomerically enriched mixtures. Also included within the scope of<br>
the invention are the individual isomers of the compounds represented by formula (I)<br>
above as well as any wholly or partially equilibrated mixtures thereof. The present<br>
invention also covers the individual isomers of the compounds represented by the<br>
formulas above as mixtures with isomers thereof in which one or more chiral centers<br>
are inverted.<br>
It is also noted that the compounds of Formula (I) may form tautomers. It is<br>
understood that all tautomers and mixtures of tautomers of the compounds of the<br>
compounds of formula (I) are included within the scope of the compounds of the<br>
present invention.<br>

In another embodiment, the process of preparing a compound of formula (I)<br>
includes the step of:<br>
(i) reacting a compound of formula (Q1)<br>
with an alkylating agent to prepare a compound of formula (R1),<br>
X1, X2, and the alkylating agent are as defined above.<br>
Such process may further comprise a step (ii) wherein the compound of<br>
formula (R) is converted to a compound of formula (I) by condensation with a<br>
compound of formula (A1) and then a compound of formula (A")<br>
Q1 and ch are as described above.<br>
In a further embodiment, the process includes a further step (ii1) reducing the<br>
compound of formula (R1) to a compound of formula (R"):<br>

the compound of formula (S) to a compound of formula (T):<br>
Such step (ii1) is typically performed before or concurrently with the second<br>
condensation step as illustrated in Scheme 1. The alkylation is performed using<br>
methods known in the art, see Encyclopedia of Reagents for Organic Synthesis;<br>
Paquette, L A., Ed.; John Wiley ft Sons, 1995, and is further described in Scheme 1 and<br>
the Examples following.<br>
In still another embodiment, the process includes a further step (iii) converting<br>
the compound of formula (I) into a salt and/or solvated form of the compound of<br>
formula (I).<br>
Scheme 1 depicts one embodiment of a process for preparing compounds of<br>
Formula (I). A substituted 6-nitroindazole Q1 undergoes alkylation by an appropriate<br>
alkylating agent (see above) to provide the N2-alkylated nitroindazole R1. Reduction<br>
of the nitro group using standard conditions (e.g., SnCl2, aqueous acid or 10% Pd/C,<br>
methanol, ammonium formate) followed by condensation with 2,4-diehloropyrimidine<br>
provides the chloropyrimidine S. Alkylation of the bisaryl amine nitrogen under<br>
appropriate alkylation conditions (e.g., Mel, Cs2CO3 or NaH, DMF) affords intermediate<br>
T, which undergoes subsequent condensation with an appropriately substituted aniline<br>
{A") to provide the compound of Formula (I). X1, X2, X4, Q1 and ch are as described<br>
above.<br>

N-(2-chloropyrimidin-4-yl)-N,2(3-trimethyl-2H-indazol-6-amine<br>
While it is possible that, for use in therapy, therapeutically effective amounts<br>
of a compound of formula (I), as well as salts, solvates and physiological functional<br>
derivatives thereof, may be administered as the raw chemical, it is possible to present<br>
the active ingredient as a pharmaceutical composition. Accordingly, the invention<br>
further provides pharmaceutical compositions, which include therapeutically effective<br>
amounts of compounds of the formula (I) and salts, solvates and physiological<br>
functional derivatives thereof, and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers,<br>
diluents, or excipients. The compounds of the formula (I) and salts, solvates and<br>
physiological functional derivatives thereof, are as described above. The carrier(s),<br>
diluent(s) or excipient(s) must be acceptable in the sense of being compatible with the<br>
other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof. In<br>
accordance with another aspect of the invention there is also provided a process for .<br>
the preparation of a pharmaceutical formulation including admixing a compound of<br>
the formula (I), or salts, solvates, and physiological functional derivatives thereof, with<br>
one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents, or excipients.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations may be presented in unit dose forms containing a<br>
predetermined amount of active ingredient per unit dose. Such a unit may contain,<br>
for example, 0.5mg to 1g, preferably 1mg to 700mg, of a compound of the formula (I)<br>
depending on the condition being treated, the route of administration and the age,<br>
weight and condition of the patient. Preferred unit dosage formulations are those<br>
containing a daily dose or sub-dose, as herein above recited, or an appropriate<br>
fraction thereof, of an active ingredient. Furthermore, such pharmaceutical<br>
formulations may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the pharmacy art.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations may be adapted for administration by any<br>
appropriate route, for example by the oral (including buccal or sublingual), rectal,<br>
nasal, topical (including buccal, sublingual or transdermal),. vaginal or parenteral<br>
(including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous or intradermal) route. Such<br>
formulations may be prepared by any method known in the art of pharmacy, for<br>
example by bringing into association the active ingredient with the carrier(s) or<br>
excipient(s).<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for oral administration may be<br>
presented as discrete units such as capsules or tablets; powders or granules; solutions<br>
or suspensions in aqueous or non-aqueous liquids; edible foams or whips; or oil-in-<br>
water liquid emulsions or water-in-oil liquid emulsions.<br>
For instance, for oral administration in the form of a tablet or capsule, the<br>
active drug component can be combined with an oral, non-toxic pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable inert carrier such as ethanol, giycerol, water and the like. Powders are<br>
prepared by comminuting the compound to a suitable fine size and mixing with a<br>
similarly comminuted pharmaceutical carrier such as an edible carbohydrate, as, for<br>
example, starch or mannitol. Flavoring, preservative, dispersing and coloring agent<br>
can also be present.<br>
Capsules are made by preparing a powder mixture as described above, and<br>
filling formed gelatin sheaths. Glidants and lubricants such as colloidal silica, talc,<br>
magnesium stearate, calcium stearate or solid polyethylene glycol can be added to the<br>
powder mixture before the filling operation. A disintegrating or solubilizing agent<br>
such as agar-agar, calcium carbonate or sodium carbonate can also be added to<br>
improve the availability of the medicament when the capsule is ingested.<br>
Moreover, when desired or necessary, suitable binders, lubricants,<br>
disintegrating agents and coloring agents can also be incorporated into the mixture.<br>
Suitable binders include starch, gelatin, natural sugars such as glucose or beta-lactose,<br>
corn sweeteners, natural and synthetic gums such as acacia, tragacanth or sodium<br>
alginate, carboxymethyleellulose, polyethylene glycol, waxes and the like. Lubricants<br>
used in these dosage forms include sodium oleate, sodium stearate, magnesium<br>
stearate, sodium benzoate, sodium acetate, sodium chloride and the like.<br>
Disintegrators include, without limitation, starch, methyl cellulose, agar, bentonite,<br>
xanthan gum and the like. Tablets are formulated, for example, by preparing a powder<br>
mixture, granulating or slugging, adding a lubricant and disintegrant and pressing<br>
into tablets. A powder mixture is prepared by mixing the compound, suitably<br>
comminuted, with a diluent or base as described above, and optionally, with a binder<br>
such as carboxymethyleellulose, an aliginate, gelatin, or polyvinyl pyrrolidone, a<br>
solution retardant such as paraffin, a resorption accelerator such as a quaternary salt<br>
and/or an absorption agent such as bentonite, kaolin or dicalcium phosphate. The<br>
powder mixture can be granulated by wetting with a binder such as syrup, starch<br>
paste, acadia mucilage or solutions of cellulosic or polymeric materials and forcing<br>
through a screen. As an alternative to granulating, the powder mixture can be run<br>
through the tablet machine and the result is imperfectly formed slugs broken into<br>
granules. The granules can be lubricated to prevent sticking to the tablet forming dies<br>
by means of the addition of stearic acid, a stearate salt, talc or mineral oil. The<br>
lubricated mixture is then compressed into tablets. The compounds of the present<br>
invention can also be combined with a free flowing inert carrier and compressed into<br>
tablets directly without going through the granulating or slugging steps. A clear or<br>
opaque protective coating consisting of a sealing coat of shellac, a coating of sugar or<br>
polymeric material and a polish coating of wax can be provided. Dyestuffs can be<br>
added to these coatings to distinguish different unit dosages.<br>
Oral fluids such as solution, syrups and elixirs can be prepared in dosage unit<br>
form so that a given quantity contains a predetermined amount of the compound.<br>
Syrups can be prepared by dissolving the compound in a suitably flavored aqueous<br>
solution, while elixirs are prepared through the use of a non-toxic alcoholic vehicle.<br>
Suspensions can be formulated by dispersing the compound in a non-toxic vehicle.<br>
Solubilizers and emulsifiers such as ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols and polyoxy<br>
ethylene sorbitol ethers, preservatives, flavor additives such as peppermint oil or<br>
natural sweeteners or saccharin or other artificial sweeteners, and the like can also be<br>
added.<br>
Where appropriate, dosage unit formulations for oral administration can be<br>
microencapsulated. The formulation can also be prepared to prolong or sustain the<br>
release as for example by coating or embedding particulate material in polymers, wax<br>
or the like.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) and salts, solvates and physiological functional<br>
derivatives thereof, can also be administered in the form of liposome delivery systems,<br>
such as small unilamellar vesicles, large unilamellar vesicles and multilamellar vesicles.<br>
Liposomes can be formed from a variety of phospholipids, such as cholesterol,<br>
stearylamine or phosphatidylcholines.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) and salts, solvates and physiological functional<br>
derivatives thereof may also be delivered by the use of monoclonal antibodies as<br>
individual carriers to which the compound molecules are coupled. The compounds<br>
may also be coupled with soluble polymers as targetable drug carriers. Such polymers<br>
can include polyvinylpyrrolidone, pyran copolymer,<br>
polyhydroxypropylmethacrylamide-phenol, polyhydroxyethylaspartamidephenol, or<br>
polyethyleneoxidepolylysine substituted with palmitoyl residues. . Furthermore, the<br>
compounds may be coupled to a class of biodegradable polymers useful in achieving<br>
controlled release of a drug, for example, polylactic acid, polepsilon caprolactone,<br>
polyhydroxy butyric acid, polyorthoesters, polyacetals, polydihydropyrans,<br>
polycyanoacrylates and cross-linked or amphipathic block copolymers of hydrogels.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for transdermal administration may be<br>
presented as discrete patches intended to remain in intimate contact with the<br>
epidermis of the recipient for a prolonged period of time. For example, the active<br>
ingredient may be delivered from the patch by iontophoresis as generally described in<br>
Pharmaceutical Research, 3(6), 318 (1986).<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for topical administration may be<br>
formulated as ointments, creams, suspensions, lotions, powders, solutions, pastes, gels,<br>
sprays, aerosols or oils.<br>
For treatments of the eye or other external tissues, for example mouth and<br>
skin, the formulations are preferably applied as a topical ointment or cream. When<br>
formulated in an ointment, the active ingredient may be employed with either a<br>
paraffinic or a water-miscible ointment base. Alternatively, the active ingredient may<br>
be formulated in a cream with an oil-in-water cream base or a water-in-oil base.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for topical administrations to the eye<br>
include eye drops wherein the active ingredient is dissolved or suspended in a suitable<br>
carrier, especially an aqueous solvent.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for topical administration in the mouth<br>
include lozenges, pastilles and mouth washes.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for rectal administration may be<br>
presented as suppositories or as enemas.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for nasal administration wherein the<br>
carrier is a solid include a coarse powder having a particle size for example in the<br>
range 20 to 500 microns which is administered in the manner in which snuff is taken,<br>
i.e., by rapid inhalation through the nasal passage from a container of the powder<br>
held close up to the nose. Suitable formulations wherein the carrier is a liquid, for<br>
administration as a nasal spray or as nasal drops, include aqueous or oil solutions of<br>
the active ingredient.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for administration by inhalation include<br>
fine particle dusts or mists, which may be generated by means of various types of<br>
metered, dose pressurised aerosols, nebulizers or insufflators.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for vaginal administration may be<br>
presented as pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or spray formulations.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for parenteral administration include<br>
aqueous and non-aqueous sterile injection solutions which may contain anti-oxidants,<br>
buffers, bacteriostats and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the<br>
blood of the intended recipient; and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions<br>
Which may include suspending agents and thickening agents. The formulations may<br>
be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example sealed ampules and<br>
vials, and may be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the<br>
addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example water for injections, immediately<br>
prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared<br>
from sterile powders, granules and tablets.<br>
It should be understood that in addition to the ingredients particularly<br>
mentioned above, the formulations may include other agents conventional in the art<br>
having regard to the type of formulation in question, for example those suitable for<br>
oral administration may include flavouring agents.<br>
A therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the present invention<br>
will depend upon a number of factors including, for example, the age and weight of<br>
the animal, the precise condition requiring treatment and its severity, the nature of<br>
the formulation, and the route of administration, and will ultimately be at the<br>
discretion of the attendant physician or veterinarian. However, an effective amount<br>
of a compound of formula (I) for the treatment of. neoplastic growth, for example<br>
colon or breast carcinoma, will generally be in the range of 0.1 to 100 mg/kg body<br>
weight of recipient (mammal) per day and more usually in the range of 1 to 50 mg/kg<br>
body weight per day. Thus, for a 70kg adult mammal, the actual amount per day<br>
would usually be from 70 to 700 mg and this amount may be given in a single dose<br>
per day or more usually in a number (such as two, three, four, five or six) of sub-doses<br>
per day such that the total daily dose is the same. An effective amount of a salt or<br>
solvate, or physiologically functional derivative thereof, may be determined as a<br>
proportion of the effective amount of the compound of formula (I) per se. It is<br>
envisaged that similar dosages would be appropriate for treatment of the other<br>
conditions referred to above.<br>
The compounds of the present invention and their salts and solvates, and<br>
physiologically functional derivatives thereof, may be employed alone or in<br>
combination with other therapeutic agents for the treatment of the above-mentioned<br>
conditions. In particular, in anti-cancer therapy, combination with other<br>
chemotherapeutic, hormonal or antibody agents is envisaged as well as combination<br>
with surgical therapy and radiotherapy. Combination therapies according to the<br>
present invention thus comprise the administration of at least one compound of<br>
formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof, or a<br>
physiologically functional derivative thereof, and the use of at least one other cancer<br>
treatment method. Preferably, combination therapies according to the present<br>
invention comprise the administration of at least one compound of formula (I) or a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof, or a physiologically functional<br>
derivative .thereof, and at least one other pharmaceutically active agent, preferably an<br>
anti-neoplastic agent. The compound(s) of formula (I) and the other pharmaceutically<br>
active agent(s) may be administered together or separately and, when administered<br>
separately this may occur simultaneously or sequentially in any order. The amounts<br>
of the compound(s) of formula (I) and the other pharmaceutically active agent(s) and<br>
the relative timings of administration will be selected in order to achieve the desired<br>
combined therapeutic effect.<br>
The compounds of the Formula (I) or salts, solvates, or physiologically<br>
functional derivatives thereof and at least one additional cancer treatment therapy<br>
may be employed in combination concomitantly or sequentially in any. therapeutically<br>
appropriate combination with such other anti-cancer therapies. In one embodiment,<br>
the other anti-cancer therapy is at least one additional ehemotherapeutic therapy<br>
including administration of at least one anti-neoplastic agent. The administration in<br>
combination of a compound of formula (I) or salts, solvates, or physiologically<br>
functional derivatives thereof with other anti-neoplastic agents may be in<br>
combination in accordance with the invention by administration concomitantly in (1)<br>
a unitary pharmaceutical composition including both compounds or (2) separate<br>
pharmaceutical compositions each including one of the compounds. Alternatively, the<br>
combination may be administered separately in a sequential manner wherein one<br>
anti-neoplastic agent is administered first and the other second or vice versa. Such<br>
sequential administration may be close in time or remote in time.<br>
Anti-neoplastic agents may induce anti-neoplastic effects in a cell-cycle<br>
specific manner, i.e., are phase specific and act at a specific phase of the cell cycle, or<br>
bind DNA and act in a non cell-cycle specific manner, i.e., are non-cell cycle specific<br>
and operate by other mechanisms.<br>
Anti-neoplastic agents useful in combination with the compounds and salts,<br>
solvates or physiologically functional derivatives thereof of formula I include the<br>
following:<br>
(1) cell cycle specific anti-neoplastic agents including, but not limited to,<br>

estrogens such as tamoxifen, toremifene, raloxifene, droloxifene and iodoxyfene;<br>
progestrogens such as megestrol acetate; aromatase inhibitors such as anastrozole,<br>

The compounds of formula (I) and salts, solvates and physiological functional<br>
derivatives thereof, are believed to have anticancer activity as a result of inhibition of<br>
the protein kinase VEGFR2" and its effect on selected cell lines whose growth is<br>
dependent on VEGFR2 protein kinase activity.<br>
The present invention thus also provides compounds of formula (I) and<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts or solvates thereof, or physiologically functional<br>
derivatives thereof, for use in medical therapy, and particularly in the treatment of<br>
disorders mediated by inappropriate VEGFR2 activity.<br>
The inappropriate VEGFR2 activity referred to herein is any VEGFR2 activity<br>
that deviates from the normal VEGFR2 activity expected in a particular mammalian<br>
subject. Inappropriate VEGFR2 activity may take the form of, for instance, an<br>
abnormal increase in activity, or an aberration in the timing and or control of VEGFR2<br>
activity. Such inappropriate activity may result then, for example, from<br>
overexpression or mutation of the protein kinase or ligand leading to inappropriate or<br>
uncontrolled activation of the receptor. Furthermore, it is also understood that<br>
unwanted VEGFR2 activity may reside in an abnormal source, such as a malignancy.<br>
That is, the level of VEGFR2 activity does not have to be abnormal to be considered<br>
inappropriate, rather the activity derives from an abnormal source. In a like manner,<br>
the inappropriate angiogenesis referred to herein is any angiogenic activity that<br>
deviates from the normal angiogenic activity expected in a particular mammalian<br>
subject. Inappropriate angiogenesis may take the form of, for instance, an abnormal<br>
increase in activity, or an aberration in the timing and or control of angiogenic<br>
activity. Such inappropriate activity may result then, "for example, from<br>
overexpression or mutation of a protein kinase or ligand leading to inappropriate or<br>
uncontrolled activation of angiogenesis. Furthermore, it is also understood that<br>
unwanted angiogenic activity may reside in an abnormal source, such as a<br>
malignancy. That is, the level of angiogenic activity does not have to be abnormal to<br>
be considered inappropriate, rather the activity derives from an abnormal source.<br>
The present invention is directed to methods of regulating, modulating, or<br>
inhibiting VEGFR2 for the prevention and/or treatment of disorders related to<br>
unregulated VEGFR2 activity. In particular, the compounds of the present invention<br>
can also be used in the treatment of certain forms of cancer. Furthermore, the<br>
compounds of the present invention can be used to provide additive or synergistic<br>
effects with certain existing cancer chemotherapies and radiation, and/or be used to<br>
restore effectiveness of certain existing cancer chemotherapies and radiation.<br>

The compounds of this invention may be made by a variety of methods,<br>
including standard chemistry. Any previously defined variable will continue to have<br>
the previously defined meaning unless otherwise indicated. Illustrative general<br>
synthetic methods are set out below and then specific compounds of the invention<br>
are prepared in the working Examples.<br>
Compounds of general formula (I) may be prepared by methods known in the<br>
art of organic synthesis as set forth in part by the following synthesis schemes.<br>
Generally, the following schemes are illustrated using compounds of formula (I), but it<br>
is recognized that such schemes are easily adaptable by the skilled artisan to prepare<br>
compounds of formula (I), including compounds of formula (I1) and (I"). It is also<br>
recognized that in all of the schemes described below, it is well understood that<br>
protecting groups for sensitive or reactive groups are employed where necessary in<br>
accordance with general principles of chemistry. Protecting groups are manipulated<br>
according to standard methods of organic synthesis (T. W. Green and P. G. M. Wuts<br>
(1991) Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley Et Sons). These groups are<br>
removed at a convenient stage of the. compound synthesis using methods that are<br>
readily apparent to those skilled in the art. The selection of processes as well as the<br>
reaction conditions and order of their execution shall be consistent with the<br>
preparation of compounds of formula (I). Those skilled in the art will recognize if a<br>
stereocenter exists in compounds of formula (I). Accordingly, the present invention<br>
includes both possible stereoisomers and includes not only racemic compounds but<br>
the individual enantiomers as well. When a compound is desired as a single<br>
enantiomer, it may be obtained by stereospecific synthesis or by resolution of the final<br>
product or any convenient intermediate. Resolution of the final product, an<br>
intermediate, or a starting material may be effected by any suitable method known in<br>
the art. See, for example, Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds by E. L Eliel, S. H.<br>
Wilen, and L. N. Mander (Wiley-lnterscience, 1994).<br>

Procedure 1:<br>
To a stirred solution of 18.5 g (0.11 mol) of 3-methyl-6-nitro-7H-indazole in<br>
350 ml acetone, at room temperature, was added 20 g (0.14 mol) of trimethyloxonium<br>
tetraflouroborate. After the solution was allowed to stir under argon for 3 houre, the<br>
solvent was.removed under reduced pressure. To the resulting solid was added<br>
saturated aqueous NaHCch (600 mL) and a 4:1 mixture of chloroform-isopropanol<br>
(200 ml), the mixture was agitated and the layers were separated. The aqueous phase<br>
was washed with additional chloroform: isopropanol (4 x 200 mL) and the combined<br>
organic phase was dried (Na2S04). Filtration and removal of solvent gave a tan solid.<br>
The solid was washed with ether (200 mL) to afford 2,3-dimethyl-6-nitro-2H-indazole<br>
as a yellow solid (15.85 g, 73 °/o). 1H NMR (300 MHz.DMSO-d6) 5 8.51 (s, 1H), 7.94 (d,<br>

Procedure 2:<br>
Trimethyl orthoformate (11 mmol, 1.17 g) was added over a 2 min period to a<br>
solution of boron trifluoride etherate (12.5 mmol, 1.77 g in methylene chloride (2.0<br>
mL) which had been cooled to -30 °C. The mixture was warmed to 0 °C for 15 min<br>
and was then cooled to -70 °C. The nitro indazole (10 mmol, 1.77 g) was slurried in<br>
methylene chloride (30 mL) and was added all at once to the cooled mixture. The<br>
mixture was stirred at -70 °C for 15 min and at ambient temperature for 17 h. After<br>
17 h the mixture was red and heterogeneous. The reaction mixture was quenched<br>
with saturated sodium bicarbonate solution (20 mL) and the organic layer separated.<br>
The aqueous layer was extracted with methylene chloride (30 mL). The methylene<br>
chloride layers were combined and extracted with water (30 mL). The methylene<br>
chloride layer was distilled under reduced pressure until ~ 10 mL remained. Propanol<br>
(10 mL) was added and the remainder of the methylene chloride removed under<br>
reduced pressure, resulting in a yellow slurry. The product was isolated by filtration to<br>
give 2,3-dimethyl-6-nitro-2H-indazole (65 %, 7mmol, 1.25 g) as a light yellow<br>
powder. "H NMR (300 MHz, DMSO-de) 8 8.51 (s, 1H), 7.94 (d, J= 9.1 Hz, 1H), 7.73 (d, J<br>

Procedure 3:<br>
In a 25 ml round bottom flask 3-methyl-6-nitroindazole (7.27 mmol, 1.28 g)<br>
was dissolved with stirring in DMSO (4.0 mL) and was treated with concentrated<br>
sulfuric acid (7.27 mmol, 0.73 g) to yield a thick slurry. The slurry was treated with<br>
dimethyl sulfate (21.1 .mmol, 2.66 g). The mixture was heated under nitrogen at 50 °C<br>
for 72 h. After 72 h a thick yellow slurry was obtained. The slurry was cooled and was<br>
slowly treated with saturated sodium bicarbonate solution (10 mL). The mixture was<br>
extracted with methylene chloride (2 x 20 mL). The methylene chloride layers were<br>
combined and back extracted with water (20 mL). The methylene chloride layer was<br>
treated with propanol (10 mL) and the methylene chloride was removed by distillation<br>
under reduced pressure. The solid was isolated by filtration and the yellow solid<br>
washed with heptane (5 mL) and air-dried. The 2,3-dimethyl-6-nitro-2H-indazole<br>
product (70%, 0.97 g) was obtained as a light yellow solid. "H NMR (300 MHz, DMSO-<br>

indazole sulfuric acid salt (5.0 g, 18.2 mmol) and methylene chloride (25 mL). The<br>
mixture was stirred at 25 °C and was treated with DMSO (5 mL). Dimethyl sulfate (6.7<br>
g, 5.0 mL, 53.0 mmol) was added via syringe and the reaction was heated at reflux in a<br>
70 °C bath. After 7 h HPLC analysis showed 9% starting material. At this point heating<br>
was stopped and the workup begun. Saturated sodium bicarbonate solution (35 mL)<br>
was added to the reaction mixture at RT. The layers were allowed to separate and the<br>
aqueous layer was extracted with inethylene chloride (25 mL). The methylene chloride<br>
layers were combined and washed with water (2 x 25 mL). The rnethylene chloride<br>
layer was distilled under reduced pressure until half the volume was removed.<br>
Propanol (25 mL) was added and distillation under reduced pressure was continued<br>
until all the methylene chloride had been removed. This yielded a yellow slurry, which<br>
was allowed to stir at 25 °C for 1 h. The product was isolated via filtration and the<br>
resulting yellow solid was washed with heptane (10 mL). This yielded 2,3-dimethyl-6-<br>

addition rate, which kept the reaction temperature at or between 25 and 30 °C. The<br>
reaction was allowed to proceed at 25 °C. After 6 h the reaction was judged to be<br>
finished based on HPLC analysis. The mixture was filtered and the catalyst washed<br>
with methanol (50 mL). The methanol layers were combined and the.solvent removed<br>
under reduced pressure. The residue was dissolved in water (200 mL) and was<br>
extracted with methylene chloride (3 x 250 mL). The methylene chloride layers were<br>
combined and solvent removed under vacuum to remove approximately half the<br>
solvent. Heptane (400 mL) was added and the vacuum distillation continued until<br>
approximately 300 mL reaction product slurry remained. The product was isolated by<br>
filtration and dried under vacuum at 50 °C for 4 h. to yield 2,3-dimethyl-6-amino-<br>

BIOLOGICAL DATA<br>
The compounds of the present invention elicit important and measurable<br>
pharmacological responses. Each of the compounds d6scribed in the Examples section<br>
bind with high affinity (IC50 
d6scribed by the VEGFR2 HTRF assay below. In addition to binding to the kinase<br>
domain of VEGFR2, the exemplified compounds of the present invention also<br>
measurably and significantly inhibit the proliferation of endothelial cells that are<br>
stimulated for growth by activation with VEGF. Data for inhibition of cell<br>
proliferation are provid6d in Table 1 below.<br>
VEGFR2 HTRF Assay<br>
The assays were performed in 96-well black plates. 10 nM hVEGFR2 was used to<br>
phosphorylate 0.36 µ.M peptid6 (Biotin-Ahx-EEEEYFELVAKKKK) in the presence of 75<br>
µM ATP, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.3 mM DTT, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, and 0.1 M HEPES (pH 7.5). 10 µl<br>
0.5 M EDTA was add6d to reactions as negative controls. The 50 µl kinase reaction<br>
with or without inhibitors in 5°/o DMS0 was carried out at room temperature for 45<br>
minutes, then stopped by 40 µl of 125 mM EDTA. 2.4 µg/ml Streptavidin-APC and 0.15<br>
µg/ml Eu-a-pY, in the presence of 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 0.1 M HEPES (pH7.5), were add6d<br>
to a final volume of 140 u.l. The plate was incubated for 10 min at room temperature<br>
(22°C) and read on the Victor with the time resolved fluorescence mod6 by exciting at<br>
340 nm and reading the emission at 665 nm.<br>

Materials<br>
HUVEC cells and EGM-MV (Endothelial cell growth medium - microvascular)<br>
were purchased from Clonetics (San Diego, CA). VEGF and bFGF were purchased from<br>
R&amp;D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Anti-BrdU antibody was obtained from chemicon<br>
International (Temecula, CA).<br>
Methods<br>
HUVECs were routinely maintained in EGM-MV medium and were used within passage<br>
7. HUVECs were plated at a d6nsity of 2500 cells/well in M199 medium containing 5%<br>
FBS (Hyclone) in type I collagen coated plate (Becton Dickinson). The plate was<br>
incubated at 37 °C overnight. The medium was removed by aspiration, and test<br>
compounds were added to each well in 3 volume of 0.1 ml/well in serum-free M199<br>
medium. Compound concentrations ranged from 1.5 nM to 30 micromolar. The plate<br>
was incubated for 30 min at 37°C. Another 0.1 ml of serum-free M199 medium<br>
containing BSA and VEGF (or bFGF) was add6d to give a final concentration of 0.1%<br>
BSA and 10 ng/ml VEGF (0.3 ng/ml bFGF). The plate was incubated at 37°C for 72 hrs.<br>
BrdU was add6d to each well after the first 48 hrs to give a concentration of 10<br>
micromolar. The colorimetric ELISA assay was performed according to manufacturer"s<br>
(Roche Molecular Sciences) instructions, with d6tection by absorbance reading at 450<br>
nm. Results were plotted as concentration of test compound vs. absorbance to give<br>
an IC50 value for inhibition of BrdU incorporation.<br>
