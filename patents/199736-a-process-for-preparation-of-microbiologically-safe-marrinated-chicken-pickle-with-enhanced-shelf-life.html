				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a process for preparation of microbiologically safe marinated chicken pickle with enhanced shelf life.<br>
Meats are highly perishable products. Meat preservation methods such as chilling, freezing and irradiation are expensive and are not within the reach of developing countries. Pickling is traditionally followed since times immemorial for preserving the meats. Pickles are generally used as adjuncts along with bland foods such as rice, bread, roti, chapathi (Indian staple food) etc. Pickled products are common in Indian dietary and are very much relished by Indian population and by ethnic groups abroad. Microorganisms are mainly responsible for the spoilage of meats. Pickling would inhibit the growth of microorganisms, the spoilage and extend the shelf life meat. Preservation of chicken meat by pickling technique is ideally suited for semitropical and tropical countries since refrigeration facilities are inadequate in these countries. Though few investigations have been on pickling of chicken, application of new hurdles to inhibit the microbial growth would further improve the quality of the product. There is limited information on the shelf-stable chicken pickle. The objective is to develop a process for enhancing the shelf life of chicken pickle. Chicken pickles will have good potential both in domestic and export markets.<br>
Reference may be made to Japanese Patent Number 1296956 A dated 2 May 1988 by Kuroda Akira (preparation of chicken white meat pickled in mustard) wherein chicken white meat was pickled in a solution containing common salt, mustard, alcohol, reduced starch hydrolyzing agent and preservatives. The main drawbacks are that cooking or frying was not involved and shelf-stability was not determined.<br>
Reference may be made to Japanese Patent Number 5184287 A dated 2 July/ November 1991 by Ushiwaka Shoji (Preparation of meat pickled in bran) wherein chicken meat was pickled in a pickling bed containing bran, tangle, vegetables such as cabbage, salt and water. The main draw back is that chicken meat was not cooked or fried before or after pickling and shelf-stability was not studied.<br>
Reference may be made to China Patent Number 1161802 A dated October, 1997 by Dianzu Xue (Technology for making health-care food of chicken) wherein chicken meat was treated with a solution containing Chinese herbal medicines, natural perfume and flavouring material. Processing involved heating, cooling and fermentation. The drawback is that the process is laborious and is mainly intended for the people of health concerns.<br>
Reference may be made to Japanese Patent Number 3127937 A dated 2 May, 1991, by Nishimura Akira (Method for processing chicken) wherein chicken meat was freed from its original smell by removing fats and skins from the chicken, cutting into a shape, washing with water, subjecting to a vacuum treatment together with a pickle solution, roasting the surface of the treated chicken and subsequently cooling with cool water. The draw backs in this are that (a) original chicken flavor is lost (b) too many steps in the preparation and (c) not shelf-stable.<br>
Reference may be made to China Patent Number 1196199 A dated October 1998 by Viquan Dong (Chicken wing treated with sugar and preparation method thereof) wherein a sugar-fumigated chicken is made up of chicken wings as main raw material, raw material, auxiliary material including gourmet powder, edible salt, pepper, sodium nitrite and white sugar, and flavourings including liquorice root, Chinese prickly ash, anise etc. through immersion, pickling, boiling, fumigating and packing. The drawbacks in this are (a) preparation is confined to chicken wings (b) it is not a shelf-stable product.<br>
Reference may be made to China Patent Number 1087239 A dated June 1994 by Tang Zhengzhong and Huang Yuxing (Fast-food fried chicken and processing method thereof) wherein process relates to the preparation of fast food fried chicken. The preparation steps include cutting raw material chicken in pieces, mechanically mixing chicken pieces, low-temperature pickling, mixing chicken pieces with flavouring material powder and high-temperature frying under pressure. The drawbacks in this method are that (a) the process resulted in a fried chicken and (b) the product is not shelf-stable.<br>

(2)	enhancing the shelf-life of chicken pickle by lowering pH.The following examples are given by way of illustration of the present invention and should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
Broiler chickens are dressed under hygienic conditions. Skin is removed from the carcass. Meat is separated from the bones and is cut into 25 mm to 38 mm size Marination: 15 kg of meat pieces are mixed with 600 g of common salt (sodium chloride) and 3.25 liters of vinegar and kept at 2Â°C for 18 hours (3) cooking: Marinated meat pieces are subjected steam cooking for 30 min (4) Frying: Cooked meat pieces are fried in gingelly oil (5 kg) for 1 5 minutes. (5) additives: (a) Wet spices: Ginger (0.6 kg) and (b) garlic (0.6 kg) are minced and fried in gingelly oil (0.4 kg) and added; dry spices: Red chilli powder (360 g), cumin powder (72 g) turmeric (70 g) and mustard powder (150 g) are roasted (dry heat) and added (b) common salt (250 g) is added (c) a mixture containing vinegar (2.6 liters) and sugar (500 g) is added. Meat pieces are thoroughly mixed. (6) Conditioning: The mixed product (pickle) is kept at ambient temperature for 24 hours (7) packing and storage: chicken pickle is weighed into clean and dry glass bottles (450 gm pickle in each bottle. 50 ml of gingily oil is heated to 60Â°C and added to the pickle in each bottle. The bottles are covered with a lid. The bottles are stored at room temperature (30Â°C). Data were collected on physical, chemical, microbial and sensory characteristics. The results of the experiments are presented in Tables 1,2 and 3. The physical and chemical profile of chicken pickle is as follows:<br>
Moisture 26.2%; fat 18.2%; pH 4.2; salt 7.0%; peroxide value 0 and TEA number 0.56. Slight decrease in moisture content was observed at the end of 6 months storage from 26.2 to 23.1%. The fat content decreased slightly from 18.2 to 16.8%. pH has slightly increased from 4.2 to 4.3 and salt content from 7.0 to 8.8. Rancidity was not a problem in the case of chicken pickle although there was slight increase in TBA, PV and FFA values. Sensory evaluation of the product showed that the product was acceptable even at the end of 6 months storage. Microbiological studies revealed that the product was free from coliforms, Salmonella and S.aureus during storage period and total plate counts, yeasts and moulds and mesophilic anaerobic spares were within the permissible limits. The product was microbiologically safe and acceptable from the point of<br>
sensory properties and the product can be marketable within 6 months at ambient temperature (30Â°C).<br>
Example 2<br>
Chicken pickle was prepared, packed and stored at ambient temperatur (30Â°C) as detailed in example 1. The results of the second experiments are presented in tables 4 and 5. Moisture content was 26.0% initially and it decreased to 23.5% at the end of 6th month. pH was 4.1 initially and it was 4.3 at the end of 6th month. pH was well maintained during storage period and it was within the desirable limit for the stability of the product. The initial salt content of the product was 7.5 and it increased to 8.7% during storage period. The fat content of the product in the beginning was 18.4% and it decreased to 17.0% at the end of 6th month storage. Rancidity was not a problem though there was slight increase in PV, TBA and FFA values. Results with regard to sensory properties demonstrated that the product was acceptable even at the end of 6th month storage. Microbiological studies showed that the product was free from coliforms, Salmonella and S.aureus during storage period. Total counts, yeasts and moulds and mesophilic anaerobic spores were well within the permissible limits. Thus the chicken pickle was shelf-stable, microbiologically safe and acceptable from the point of sensory properties.<br>
Example 3<br>
As in example 1, chicken pickle was prepared, packed and stored at ambient temperature (30Â°C). The results (Tables 7,8,9) indicate that the pH recorded at the initial stage (4.2) and during storage (4.30 and 4.4) was well within the requirement for the stability the product.. Physical, chemical, microbial and sensory profile observed in the product initially and during storage was similar to that of Example 2.<br>
The above experiments clearly indicate that shelf-life of chicken pickle can be enhanced by subjecting the chicken pieces to marination (with salt and vinegar), cooking, frying, adding spices and common salt and then conditioning with a mixture of vinegar and sugar.<br>
