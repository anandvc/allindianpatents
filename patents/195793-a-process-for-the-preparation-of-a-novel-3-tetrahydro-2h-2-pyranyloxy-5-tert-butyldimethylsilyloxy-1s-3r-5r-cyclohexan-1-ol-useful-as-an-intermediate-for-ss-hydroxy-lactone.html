We claim<br>
1.  A process for the preparation of a novel 3-tetrahydro-2H-2-pyranyloxy-5-<br>
(tert.butyldimethylsilyloxy)-(1S,3R,5R)-cyclohexan-1-ol having formula 7<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
useful as an intermediate for ß-hydroxy /-lactone which comprises reacting a compound 3-tetrahydro-2H-2-pyranyloxy-5-(tert.butyldimethylsilyioxy)-(1S.3R 5R) -cyclohexylacetate(6) with an anhydrous potassium carbonate in an organic solvent such as herein described at room temperature ranging for a period from 2 to 6 hrs, evaporating the solvent, extracting with organic solvent, washing witfi brine solution, drying, evaporating and column chromatography to obtain 3-tetrahydro-2H-2-pyranyloxy-5-(tert.butyldlmethyisilyloxy)-(1S.3R,5R)-cyclohexan-1-ol (7).<br>
2.	A process as claimed In claim 1 wherein the organic solvent used for the extraction of the product is selected from the group consisting of efhyj acetate, chloroform, and dichloromethane<br>
3.	A process  as claimed in claims 1-2 wherein the organic solvent used for the reaction is selected from the group consisting of ethyl acetate, chlorofonr, dichloromethane, methanol and diethyl ether.<br>
4. A process for the preparation of a novel 3-tetrahydro-2H-2-pyranyloxy-5-(tert.butyldinnethylsiiyloxy)-(1S,3R,5R)-cyclohexan-1-ol useful as an intermediate for p-hydroxy y-lactone substantially as herein described with reference to the examples.<br></td>
