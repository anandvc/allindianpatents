TITLE:	SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR ORDER PLACEMENT IN<br>
AN ELECTRONIC TRADING ENVIRONMENT<br>
TECHNICAL FffiLD<br>
The present invention is directed to electronic trading. More specifically, the present<br>
invention is directed towards automated order entry tools in an electronic trading<br>
environment.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Trading methods have evolved from a manually intensive process to a technology<br>
enabled, electronic platform. With the advent of electronic trading, a user or trader can be in<br>
virtually direct contact with the market, from practically anywhere in the world, performing<br>
near real-time transactions.<br>
Electronic trading is generally based on a host exchange, one or more computer<br>
networks, and client devices. In general, the host exchange includes one or more centralized<br>
computers to form the electronic heart. Its operations typically include maintaining an<br>
exchange' order book that records' unexecuted' orders, 'order matching, providing price and â€¢<br>
order fill information, and managing and updating a database that records such information.<br>
The host exchange is also equipped with an external interface that maintains uninterrupted<br>
contact to the client devices and possibly other trading-related systems.<br>
Using client devices, traders link to the host exchange through one or more networks.<br>
A client device is a computer such as a personal computer, laptop computer, hand-held<br>
computer, and so forth that has network access. A network is a group of two or more<br>
computers or devices linked together in any fashion, which can be characterized by topology,<br>
protocol, and architecture. For example, some market participants may link to the host<br>
through a direct network connection such as a Tl or ISDN. Some participants may link to the<br>
host exchange through direct network connections and through other common network<br><br>
WO 2007/041281	PCT/US2006/038030<br>
components such as high-speed servers, routers, and gateways. As explained in greater detail<br>
below, a client device may access an exchange through a gateway, and a router may route<br>
messages between the gateway and the exchange. The Internet, a well-known collection of<br>
networks and gateways, can be used to establish a connection between the client device and<br>
the host exchange. There are many different types of wired and wireless networks and<br>
combinations of network types known in the art that can link traders to the host exchange.<br>
Sometimes, on their machines, traders use automated or semi-automated trading tools,<br>
collectively hereinafter referred to as automated tools, that automatically or semi-<br>
automatically send orders to the exchange. Such trading tools are usually provided to, among<br>
other things, facilitate fast and accurate order entry. For instance, an automated tool might<br>
quickly calculate one or more order parameters, such as order price or order quantity, based<br>
on market conditions, or some other reference condition, and then automatically send an order<br>
with these parameters to an exchange for matching. According to many existing and popular<br>
exchanges today, orders are electronically entered in an exchange order book in the sequence<br>
in which they are entered into the market (a first-in, first-out, commonly referred to as FIFO<br>
matching system). Based on this sequence, and the availability of market quantity, orders are<br>
filled, with priority given to the first order entered, then the second (next) order entered, and<br>
so forth. It should be understood that different matching systems can be used as well.<br>
In addition to trading individual tradeable objects, many traders often implement<br>
trading strategies that involve simultaneous trading of two or more tradeable objects. One<br>
such trading strategy is commonly referred to as spread trading. In general, spread trading is<br>
the buying and/or selling of one, two, or more tradeable objects, the purpose of which is to<br>
capitalize on changes or movements in the relationships between the tradeable objects. The<br>
tradeable objects that are used to complete a spread are referred to as the outright markets or<br>
2<br><br>
WO 2007/041281	PCT/US2006/038030<br>
legs of the spread. A spread trade could involve buying tradeable objects, buying and selling<br>
tradeable objects, selling tradeable objects or some combination thereof.<br>
As used herein, the term "tradeable object" refers to anything that can be traded with a<br>
quantity and/or price. It includes, but is not limited to, all types of traded events, goods and/or<br>
financial products, which can include, for example, stocks, options, bonds, futures, currency,<br>
and warrants, as well as funds, derivatives and collections of the foregoing, and all types of<br>
commodities, such as grains, energy, and metals. The tradeable object may be "real," such as<br>
products that are listed by an exchange for trading, or "synthetic," such as a combination of<br>
real products that is created by the user. A tradeable object could actually be a combination<br>
of other tradeable objects, such as a class of tradeable objects.<br>
Spread trading may involve risk. For example, to achieve a spread differential, a<br>
trader typically works orders in two or more different markets. An order in one of those<br>
markets may fill, but the market conditions could change in another market, leaving the<br>
offsetting order unfilled and the spread incomplete. This results in the trading being "legged<br>
up," because only one side of the spread transaction is complete. As a result, the trader might<br>
lose large amounts of money to complete the transaction at an undesirable price, or remain<br>
unfilled totally.<br>
Currently, there are two ways a trader could trade a spread. To avoid some of the risks<br>
of being "legged up," traders may trade in exchange provided spread markets. Electronic<br>
exchanges have introduced spread markets that guarantee the trader will not be "legged up"<br>
by taking certain precautions, for example. Accordingly, those exchange provided spreads<br>
might behave differently than if they did not provide this "no-legged" up guarantee. The<br>
different behavior expressed by these types of exchange-provided-spreads might result in less<br>
aggressive and less riskier trading than through conventional spread trading where the trader<br>
works orders in multiple markets to achieve a spread differential upon execution.<br>
3<br><br>
WO 2007/041281	PCT/US2006/038030<br>
According to the second method, traders can use automated spread trading tools that<br>
allow them to create their own spreads, often referred to as synthetic spreads. Once a trader<br>
defines a synthetic spread, an automated spread trading tool may generate spread market data<br>
for the synthetic spread without facing the exchange-imposed limitations. While a trader who<br>
trades spreads using, an automated spread trading tool may sometimes face a problem of<br>
getting legged up, the automated spread trading tool can generally allow the trader to be more<br>
aggressive in his/her trading, and thus potentially result in greater profits for the trader.<br>
Typically, when a trader enters a desired spread order price based on the provided<br>
spread data, an automated spread trading tool will use spread setting parameters defined by<br>
the trader to place an order in the legs of the spread. As the markets in each leg move,<br>
individual spread leg orders may be re-priced by an automated spread trading tool to achieve<br>
the desired price defined for a synthetic spread. Re-pricing of orders generally involves<br>
canceling the existing order at one price and replacing it with a new order at another price.<br>
Such a mechanism, while very helpful to a trader to achieve a desired spread price, results in<br>
the newly submitted order being placed at the end of an order queue corresponding to the<br>
order's new price at an electronic exchange. However, it is desirable to have orders as close<br>
to the front of the order queue as possible to increase the likelihood of the orders getting<br>
filled. Thus, re-pricing the order increases the likelihood of the order not getting filled. It is<br>
desirable to offer tools that can assist a trader in trading in an electronic trading environment,<br>
and help the trader make trades at the most favorable prices in a speedy and accurate manner.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
I. Overview<br>
Example system and associated methods described below provide means for<br>
intelligent placement and movement of orders within a range of prices. Using the described<br>
methods a trader may potentially get a more favorable queue position for spread leg orders<br>
when changes in the market corresponding to the leg order cause re-pricing of one or more leg<br>
orders. More specifically, according to the example embodiments described below, in<br>
addition to submitting a leg order at a calculated price level, additional orders at prices either<br>
below or above the calculated price level are submitted as well for the same leg to ensure a<br>
better queue position for the future re-priced leg orders. According to such an embodiment, if<br>
the market changes such that it is necessary to re-price either or both leg orders, the leg orders<br>
at the initially calculated prices may be deleted, and there will already be leg orders resting in<br>
the order queue at the re-calculated leg order prices.<br>
Thus, one advantage of the example methods is that the re-priced leg orders will have<br>
better queue positions as compared to the orders that would be submitted upon detecting a re-<br>
price command in response to changing market conditions. Also, the example methods may<br>
result in more fills and fewer orders getting "legged up." It should be understood that<br>
additional advantages will be apparent to those skilled in the art as well. More details related<br>
to queue holder orders as well as other tools that can be used in relation to trading strategies<br>
will be described below.<br>
While the example embodiments are described herein with reference to illustrative<br>
embodiments for particular applications, it should be understood that the example<br>
embodiments are not limited thereto. Other systems, methods, and advantages of the present<br>
embodiments will be or become apparent to one with skill in the art upon examination of the<br>
following drawings and description. It is intended that all such additional systems, methods,<br>
7<br><br>
WO 2007/041281	PCT/US2006/038030<br>
features, and advantages be within the scope of the present invention, and be protected by the<br>
accompanying claims.<br>
II. A First Example Trading System<br>
Figure 1 illustrates an example electronic trading system in which the example<br>
embodiments may be employed. In this example, the system comprises a trading station 102<br>
that accesses an electronic exchange 104 through a gateway 106. Router 108 is used to route<br>
messages between the gateway 106 and the electronic exchange 104. The electronic<br>
exchange 104 includes a computer process (e.g., the central computer) that matches buy and<br>
sell orders sent from the trading station 102 with orders from other trading stations (not<br>
shown). The electronic exchange 104 may list one or more tradeable objects for trade. While<br>
not shown in the figure for the sake of clarity, the trading system may include other devices<br>
that are specific to the client site like middleware and security measures such as firewalls,<br>
hubs, security managers, and so on, as understood by a person skilled in the art.<br>
The computer employed as the trading station 102 generally can range from a hand-<br>
held device, laptop, or personal computer to a larger computer such as a workstation and<br>
multiprocessor. An illustrative personal computer uses Pentiumâ„¢ microprocessors and<br>
operates under a Windows 2000â„¢, Windows NTâ„¢, or Windows XPâ„¢ operating system with<br>
3Com's 3CR990-TX-97 network card. Generally, the trading station 102 includes a monitor<br>
(or any other output device) and an input device, such as a keyboard and/or a two or three-<br>
button mouse to support click based trading, if so desired. One skilled in the art of computer<br>
systems will understand that the present example embodiments are not limited to any<br>
particular class or model of computer employed for the trading station 102 and will be able to<br>
select an appropriate system.<br>
The computer employed as the gateway 106 generally can range from a personal<br>
computer to a larger computer. An illustrative gateway 106 computer may use Pentiumâ„¢<br>
8<br><br>
WO 2007/041281	PCT/US2006/038030<br>
microprocessors and may operate under a Windows 2000â„¢ or Windows NTâ„¢ (server or<br>
workstation) operating system. Generally, the gateway 106 may additionally include a<br>
monitor (or any other output device), input device, and access to a database, if so desired.<br>
One skilled in the art of computer systems will also understand that the present example<br>
embodiments are not limited to any particular class or model of computer(s) employed for the<br>
gateway 106 and will be able to select an appropriate system.<br>
It should be noted that a computer system that may be employed here as a trading<br>
station or a gateway generally includes a central processing unit, a memory (a primary and/or<br>
secondary memory unit), an input interface for receiving data from a communications<br>
network, an'input interface for receiving input signals from one or more input devices (for<br>
example, a keyboard, mouse, etc.), and an output interface for communications with an output<br>
device (for example, a monitor). A system bus or an equivalent system may provide<br>
communications between these various elements.<br>
It should also be noted that the trading station 102 generally executes application<br>
programs resident at the trading station 102 under the control of the operating system of the<br>
trading station 102. Also, the gateway 106 executes application programs resident at the<br>
gateway 106 under the control of the operating system of the gateway 106. In other<br>
embodiments and as understood by a person skilled in the art, the function of the application<br>
programs at the trading station 102 may be performed by the gateway 106, and likewise, the<br>
function of the application programs at the gateway 106 may be performed by the trading<br>
station 102.<br>
The actual electronic trading system configurations are numerous, and a person skilled<br>
in the art of electronic trading systems would be able to construct a suitable network<br>
configuration. For the purposes of illustration, some example configurations are provided to<br>
illustrate where the elements may be physically located and how they might be connected to<br>
9<br><br>
WO 2007/041281	PCT/US2006/038030<br>
form an electronic trading system; these illustrations are meant to be helpful to the reader and<br>
they are not meant to be limiting. According to one example illustration, the gateway device<br>
may be located at the client site along with the trading station, which is usually remote from<br>
the matching process at the electronic exchange. According to this instance, the trading<br>
station, the gateway, and the router may communicate over a local area network, and the<br>
router may communicate with the matching process at the electronic exchange over a Tl, T3,<br>
ISDN, or some other high speed connection.<br>
In another example illustration, the client site may be located on the actual grounds of<br>
the electronic exchange (for example, in the building of the exchange). According to this<br>
instance, the trading station 102, the gateway 106, and the router 108 may still communicate<br>
over a local area network, but the router 108 may communicate with the matching process at<br>
the electronic exchange through another connection means besides a Tl, T3, or ISDN.<br>
In yet another example illustration, the gateway 106 may be housed at, or near, its<br>
corresponding electronic exchange 104. According to this instance, the trading station 102<br>
may communicate with the gateway 106 over a wide area network or through the use of a Tl,<br>
T3, ISDN, or some other high speed connection.<br>
In another example illustration, the gateway 106 may be located remote from the<br>
trading station 102 and remote from the electronic exchange 104, which might be particularly<br>
useful in systems that include interconnection of multiple trading networks. Thus, one trading<br>
network might have gateway access to an electronic exchange. Then, other trading networks<br>
may communicate with the trading network that has gateway access through a Tl, T3, ISDN,<br>
or some other high speed connection.<br>
m. A Second Example Trading System<br>
Figure 2 illustrates another example trading system that uses similar computer<br>
elements as shown in Figure 1, in which, the example embodiments may be employed to trade<br>
10<br><br>
WO 2007/041281	PCT/US2006/038030<br>
at multiple electronic exchanges. The system comprises a trading station 202 that can access<br>
multiple electronic exchanges 204 and 208. In this particular embodiment, electronic<br>
exchange 204 is accessed through gateway 206 and electronic exchange 208 is accessed<br>
through another gateway 210. Alternatively, a single gateway may be programmed to handle<br>
more than one electronic exchange. Router 212 is used to route messages between the<br>
gateways 206 and 210 and the electronic exchanges 204 and 208. While not shown in the<br>
figure, the system may include other devices that are specific to the client site like middleware<br>
and security measures like firewalls, hubs, security managers, and so on, as understood by a<br>
person skilled in the art. Additional electronic exchanges may be added to the system so that<br>
the trader can trade at any number of exchanges, if so desired.<br>
The trading system presented in Figure 2 provides the trader with the opportunity to<br>
trade tradeable objects listed at different electronic exchanges. To some traders, there can be<br>
many advantages with a multi-exchange trading environment. For example, a trader could<br>
view market information from each tradeable object through one common visual display. As<br>
such, price and quantity information from the two separate exchanges may be presented<br>
together so that the trader can view both markets simultaneously in the same window. In<br>
another example, a trader can spread trade, as will be described in greater detail below,<br>
different tradeable objects listed at the different electronic exchanges.<br>
As indicated earlier, one skilled in the art of electronic trading systems will understand<br>
that the present embodiments are not limited to the particular configurations illustrated and<br>
described with respect to Figure 1 and Figure 2, and will be able to design a particular<br>
electronic trading system based on the specific requirements (for example, by adding<br>
additional exchanges, gateways, trading stations, routers, or other computers serving various<br>
functions like message handling and security). Additionally, several networks, like either of<br>
11<br><br>
WO 2007/041281	PCT/US2006/038030<br>
the networks shown in Figure 1 or Figure 2, may be linked together to communicatively<br>
access one or more electronic exchanges.<br>
IV.	An Example Trading Station<br>
Figure 3 shows an overview of a trading station 300 which is similar to the type of<br>
trading stations 102 and 202 shown in Figures 1 and 2. Trading station 300 can be any<br>
particular type of computing device, examples of which were enumerated above. According<br>
to one example embodiment, trading station 300 has a trading application 302 stored in<br>
memory that when executed arranges and displays market information in many particular<br>
ways, usually depending on how the trader prefers to view the information. Trading<br>
application 302 may also implement an automated trading tool such as the automated spread<br>
trading tool that automatically sends orders into underlying legs to achieve a spread.<br>
Additionally, the example embodiments for regulating and managing order entry may be part<br>
of trading application 302. Preferably, trading application1 302 has access to market<br>
information from one or more exchanges 310 through API 304 (or application programming<br>
interface), and trading application 302 can also forward transaction information to exchange<br>
310 via API 304. Alternatively, API 304 could be distributed so that a portion of the API<br>
rests on the trading station 300 and a gateway, or at the exchange 310. Additionally, trading<br>
application 302 may receive signals from input device 312 via input device interface 306 and<br>
can be given the ability to send signals to display device 314 via display device interface 308.<br>
Alternatively, the example embodiments described herein may be a separate program<br>
from trading application 302, but still stored in memory and executed on the trading station<br>
300. In another alternative embodiment, the preferred embodiments may be a program stored<br>
in memory and executed on a device other than trading station 300. Example devices may<br>
include a gateway or some other well known intermediary device.<br>
V.	Automatic Spread Trading Overview<br>
12<br><br>
WO 2007/041281	PCT/US2006/038030<br>
The example embodiments describe methods for placing orders related to spread<br>
trading strategies by an automated spread trading tool. However, the example embodiments<br>
described herein are not limited to automated spread trading tools, and could be applied in<br>
relation to different automated trading tools. For example, another type of trading tool that<br>
has an automated order entry system and may benefit using the preferred embodiments is<br>
described in U.S. Patent Application, No. 10/284,584, filed on October 31, 2002 and entitled,<br>
"System and Method for Automated Trading," the contents of which are incorporated herein<br>
by reference. Also, the example embodiments are not limited to spreads, and could be easily<br>
used in relation to different trading strategies as well. The automated trading tools may be<br>
located at the trading station, a server, or even at an exchange. If located at placed other than the trading station, the automated trading tools could be still controlled using the API at the<br>
trading station. One skilled in the art of trading may readily adapt the example embodiments<br>
to work with this type of automated trading tool, or yet some other type of trading tool or<br>
trading strategies, using the teachings described herein.<br>
To assist in understanding how an automated spread trading tool might work, a<br>
general description is provided below. However, an automated spread trading tool and its<br>
functions are described in greater detail in U.S. Patent Application, No. 10/137,979, filed on<br>
May 3, 2002 and entitled, "System and Method for Performing Automatic Spread Trading,"<br>
fully incorporated herein by reference.<br>
According to one embodiment of an automated spread trading tool, a trader can select<br>
two or more individual tradeable objects, "legs," to create a synthetic spread that is sometimes<br>
referred hereinafter interchangeably as a spread. The automatic spread trading tool preferably<br>
generates spread data based on information in the legs and based on spread setting parameters,<br>
which are configurable by a user. The spread data is communicated to a graphical user<br>
interface where it is displayed in a spread window, and where data corresponding to the legs<br>
13<br><br>
WO 2007/041281	PCT/US2006/038030<br>
of the spread may be displayed as well. At the client terminal, the user can enter orders in the<br>
spread window, and the automated spread trading tool will automatically work the legs to<br>
achieve, or attempt to achieve (because the fill of the order is not always guaranteed) a desired<br>
spread.<br>
Figure 4 illustrates the relationship between a synthetically created spread 400 and its<br>
underlying "N" legs 402, where N can be any number greater than 1. For example, a spread<br>
might have two legs, three legs, four legs, and so on. Generation of the spread 400 may be<br>
based on relationships that exist between the legs 402. Some relationships which might be<br>
used are described in the above incorporated U.S. Patent Application No. 10/137,979. Also,<br>
one skilled in the art of trading may have their own relationships which they prefer to use. It<br>
is not necessary to know these relationships, however, to understand the example<br>
embodiments.<br>
Figure 5 illustrates the same relationship between synthetic spread 400 and its<br>
underlying legs 402 as in Figure 4, except that a spread order 404 has been entered. When a<br>
trader enters an order to buy or to sell the spread (e.g., spread order 404) in a synthetic<br>
market, the automated spread trading tool automatically places orders in the appropriate legs<br>
to achieve or attempt to achieve the desired spread 404. For example, to achieve synthetic<br>
spread order 404, the automated spread trading tool may automatically enter orders 406,<br>
408,...410 into the underlying legs 402 (e.g., "Leg 1," "Leg 2,"..."Leg N"). The automated<br>
spread trading tool may, among other things, calculate the quantities and prices for the orders<br>
406, 408, 410 based on market conditions in the other legs and one or more parameters. For<br>
example, according to one trading strategy, consider if "Leg 1 Order" 406 is a buy order, then<br>
the price of order 406 may be based on the best bid price of "Leg 2" and on the best bid price<br>
of each leg through "Leg N." Of course, depending on the trading strategy, the price of order<br>
406 might be based only on some of the legs and not on all N legs. Alternatively, other<br>
14<br><br>
WO 2007/041281	PCT/US2006/038030<br>
trading strategies may be used to determine the price and quantities of the orders. For<br>
example, the price of buy order 406 may be determined based on the best ask price of "Leg 2"<br>
and on the best ask price of each leg through "Leg N" (or on only some of the N legs). Of<br>
course, the order parameters of an order in one leg can be based on other types of market<br>
conditions in the other legs such as the last traded price (LTP), the last traded quantity (LTQ),<br>
a theoretical value, or some other reference point.<br>
When the leg orders are generated by the automated spread trading tool, the leg order<br>
may be routed to one or more exchanges, depending on where the tradeable objects defined<br>
for the spread are traded. If the orders are not filled right away when they are received at the<br>
exchange(s), the orders are forwarded to a matching process and placed in order queues<br>
corresponding to the prices of each leg order.<br>
According to the example embodiments, as the market conditions for each leg move,<br>
an effective spread order price may be calculated. For example, if market conditions for "Leg<br>
1" change, then an effective spread order price associated with order 404 may be determined<br>
to reflect the new market conditions. Similarly, if market conditions for "Leg 2" change, then<br>
an effective spread order price associated with order 404 may be determined. Using a<br>
conventional automated spread trading tool, if the effective spread order price is different<br>
from the desired spread order price, then the automated spread trading tool would move or re-<br>
price the leg orders in an exchange order book to' maintain the desired spread order price. In<br>
particular, the leg order(s) would be deleted from the exchange(s), and new leg order(s) would<br>
be sent to the exchange to maintain the desired spread price. There are other ways to change<br>
an order which may provide similar results, such as sending a change order request message<br>
to an exchange at which the order was placed, etc.<br>
Alternatively, effective prices of spread orders can be calculated continuously. For<br>
example, the effective spread order prices can be calculated every second or yet using some<br>
15<br><br>
WO 2007/041281	PCT7US2006/038030<br>
other time interval. According to this alternative approach, it is not necessary to monitor<br>
changes in market conditions before an effective spread order price is calculated. Similarly to<br>
the above embodiment, however, using a conventional automated spread trading tool, if the<br>
effective price of the spread order is different from the desired price of the spread order, then<br>
the automated spread trading tool would move or re-price the leg orders in the order book(s)<br>
of one or more exchanges to maintain the desired spread price being sought.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, rather than calculating an effective spread order price,<br>
the automated spread trading tool could calculate effective prices of orders in each leg of the<br>
synthetic spread. In particular, as the market conditions for each leg move, the effective<br>
prices of orders in the other legs may be calculated such that the desired spread price being<br>
sought by the trader can be maintained. For example, if market conditions for "Leg 1"<br>
change, then the effective prices of orders based on the market conditions in "Leg I," such as<br>
order 408 through order 410 may be calculated to maintain the spread. If market conditions<br>
for "Leg 2" change, then the effective prices of orders based on market conditions in "Leg 2,"<br>
such as order 406 through order 410 may be calculated to maintain the desired spread price.<br>
Further, to maintain the desired spread price being sought, using a conventional automated<br>
spread trading tool, if the effective prices of the leg orders are different from the prices of the<br>
leg orders, then the automated spread trading tool would move or re-price the leg orders in an<br>
exchange order book. In particular, the leg order(s) would be deleted from the exchange, and<br>
a new leg order(s) at the effective price would be sent to the exchange.<br>
VI. Queue Holder Overview<br>
According to the spread trading systems described above, when market conditions<br>
corresponding to one or more legs of a predefined synthetic spread change, one or more leg<br>
orders are re-priced in an exchange order book to achieve a desired spread price. Such a<br>
system, however, requires cancellation or change of the existing leg order(s) and placement of<br>
16<br><br>
WO 2007/041281	PCT/US2006/038030<br>
one or more new leg orders, thus, causing placement of the new order at the end of an order<br>
queue corresponding to a new price of the leg order.<br>
Example system and associated methods described herein provide means for<br>
intelligent placement and movement of orders within a range of prices. Using the described<br>
methods a trader may potentially get a more favorable queue position for spread leg orders<br>
when changes in the market corresponding to the leg order cause re-pricing of one or more leg<br>
orders. More specifically, according to the example embodiments described below, in<br>
addition to submitting a leg order at a calculated price level, additional orders at prices either<br>
below or above the calculated price level are submitted as well for the same leg to ensure a<br>
better queue position for the future re-priced orders. According to such an embodiment, if the<br>
market changes such that it is necessary to re-price either or both leg orders, the leg orders at<br>
the initially calculated prices may be deleted, and there will be already leg orders resting at<br>
the re-calculated leg order prices. Thus, one advantage of the example methods is that the re-<br>
priced leg orders will have better queue positions as compared to the orders that would be<br>
submitted upon detecting a re-price command in response to changing market conditions.<br>
Also, the example methods may result in more fills and fewer orders getting legged up. It<br>
should be understood that additional advantages will be apparent to those skilled in the art as<br>
well based on the description provided below.<br>
A. Placement of a Leg Order<br>
Figure 6 is a flow diagram illustrating an example method 600 for order placement<br>
according to an example embodiment. It should be understood that each block in this and<br>
each subsequent flowcharts may represent a module, segment, or portion of code, which<br>
includes one or more executable instructions for implementing specific logical functions or<br>
steps in the process. Alternate implementations are included within the scope of the example<br>
embodiments in which functions may be executed out of order from that shown or discussed,<br>
17<br><br>
WO 2007/041281	PCT/US2006/038030<br>
including substantially concurrently or in reverse order, depending on the functionality<br>
involved, as would be understood by those reasonably skilled in the art of the present<br>
invention.<br>
The flow diagram 600 provides an example queue holder mechanism that can be used<br>
to intelligently provide or attempt to provide more favorable queue positions for trader's<br>
orders. The example method 600 is described in relation to a spread strategy having two legs.<br>
However, the method 600 could also be used in relation to different orders or trading<br>
strategies as well.<br>
At step 602, a user defines an "N" number of orders to be placed in a leg of a synthetic<br>
spread. According to one example embodiment, "N" is an integer and represents a number of<br>
price levels other than the calculated price level to be used in relation to an outright leg order,<br>
the first spread leg order, in this example. It should be understood that the same or different<br>
values of "N" could be used for each leg of the spread based on the user preferences. A trader<br>
could define "N" prior to trading or at any time during trading a spread. Also, "N" could be<br>
based on one or more user-defined equations, and could dynamically change based on<br>
predefined conditions.<br>
At step 604, the user defines a desired price for a spread order. In addition to defining<br>
the desired price, the user could also define other order parameters, such as a desired spread<br>
order quantity. At step 606, in response to receiving spread order parameters, an automatic<br>
trading tool, such as an auto-spreader, in this example, computes a price for an order to be<br>
placed in the first leg of the spread, "leg 1." As described earlier, the price for the order of the<br>
first leg is computed based on market conditions of the second leg, "leg 2," to achieve the<br>
desired spread price. Also, the "leg 1" order could be either a buy order or a sell order based<br>
on whether the spread order was a buy or sell, and further based on the spread configuration.<br>
At step 608, the automated trading tool places the order for "leg 1" at the computed price at an<br>
18<br><br>
WO 2007/041281	PCT7US2006/038030<br>
electronic exchange. According to the example embodiment, placing the order involves<br>
sending the order to a matching process located at the electronic exchange.<br>
At step 610, the trading tool determines if the order placed in "leg 1" of the spread was<br>
a buy or sell order. If the placed order was a buy, at step 612, the automated trading tool<br>
places "N-l" orders in the first leg of the spread at "N-l" price levels below the computed<br>
price. If the placed order was a sell order, at step 614, the automated trading tool places "N-<br>
1" orders in "leg 1" of the spread at "N-l" price levels above the computed price. It should be<br>
understood that, according to one example embodiment, the prices below or above the<br>
computed prices corresponding to the "N-l" orders are preferably consecutive prices.<br>
According to another example embodiment, some "N-l" prices could be consecutive prices,<br>
while there could be price gaps between other prices corresponding to other "N-l" orders.<br>
The prices for the "N-l" orders could be alternatively determined based on a preset formula<br>
having one or more market condition based variables.<br>
Further alternatively, if there is not enough quantity at some price levels, "N" could be<br>
dynamically changed to ensure fill of the spread order. For example, if "N" were set to 2, and<br>
there were not enough quantity at the "N-l" price level, "N" could be dynamically modified<br>
to 3 or yet some other number to ensure the potential fill of the leg order if the leg order had<br>
to be re-priced to the "N-l" level. It should be understood that different embodiments are<br>
possible as well. It should be understood that automatic modification of "N" could be based<br>
on different variables as well. Also, while the method 600 was described in relation to one<br>
spread leg order, the same method could be applied to other spread legs as well.<br>
B. Re-pricing the Leg Order<br>
19<br><br>
WO 2007/041281	PCT/US2006/038030<br>
As mentioned earlier, when market conditions corresponding to leg orders change, the<br>
automated spread trading tool has to re-price one or more leg orders to new prices to achieve a<br>
desired spread order price. However, according to the example embodiment described in<br>
reference to Figure 6, when the automated spread trading tool is to cancel or change the<br>
existing leg order and replace it with a new order, there will be already a leg order resting at<br>
the new re-calculated leg order price. Cancellation or change of the current leg order will also<br>
cause placement of one or more additional orders at additional price levels to maintain a<br>
desired number of leg orders, "N" in these examples, one method of which will be described<br>
in the following figure. As used herein, order cancellation may be accomplished by either<br>
sending a cancellation request, or if the order is being replaced with another order, sending a<br>
change command. It should be understood that the means that is used for changing an order<br>
may be dependent on what options are allowed by an exchange.<br>
Figure 7 is a flow diagram illustrating an example method 700 for re-pricing a spread<br>
leg order according to one example embodiment. The method 700 is a continuation of the<br>
method 600 where "N-l" leg orders at "N-l" price levels were placed in relation to "leg 1"<br>
order.<br>
At step 702, new market information is detected for a tradeable object corresponding<br>
to one or more spread leg orders, such as a tradeable object corresponding to "leg 2" in this<br>
example. At step 704, the automated spread trading tool computes an effective price of an<br>
order to be placed in "leg 1" based on the new market conditions of "leg 2" and to achieve a<br>
desired spread price.<br>
At step 706, the automated spread trading tool determines if the order corresponding<br>
to "leg 1" is a buy order or a sell order. If the order is a buy order, the method continues at<br>
step 708, where the automated trading tool retrieves the current highest buy order price among<br>
all "N" buy orders placed for "leg 1." At step 710, the automated spread trading tool<br>
20<br><br>
WO 2007/041281	PCT/US2006/038030<br>
determines if the effective order price computed for "leg 1" is lower, higher, or equal to the<br>
highest buy order price corresponding to "leg 1." If the effective order price is lower than the<br>
highest buy order price among "N" orders placed for "leg 1," the order at the highest buy<br>
order price is moved to a price level below the N-th price level, where the N-th price level is<br>
the price level furthest away from the highest buy order price. The movement of an order<br>
includes cancellation of the leg order at the highest buy order price, and placement of an order<br>
at a price below the N-th price level. Alternatively, depending on user-selected order<br>
management method, the movement of an order may include changing the leg order at the<br>
highest buy order price to the price below the N-th price level. It should be understood that, if<br>
the effective order price moves by more than one tick, more than one order could be moved<br>
according to the example embodiments to maintain "N" orders for the leg.<br>
Referring back to step 710, if the effective order price for "leg 1" is higher than the<br>
highest buy order price, as shown at step 716, the automated spread trading tool moves the<br>
order at the N-th price level to a price level equal to the effective price level. The movement<br>
of the order in this embodiment involves cancellation of the order at the N-th price level and<br>
placement of a new order at the effective order price. As explained earlier, if the effective<br>
price changes by more than one tick, more than one order would be moved according to the<br>
example embodiments to maintain "N" orders for the leg. Referring back to step 710, if the<br>
effective order price is equal to the highest buy order price, all "N" orders for "leg 1" are<br>
maintained at their current price levels, and no action is taken.<br>
Referring now back to step 706, if the submitted leg order is a sell order, at step 724,<br>
the automated spread trading tool retrieves the current lowest sell order price corresponding to<br>
the first of the "N" orders submitted for "leg 1." Then, at step 726, it is determined if the new<br>
effective leg order price is lower, higher, or equal to the lowest sell order price. At step 728,<br>
if the new effective order price is lower than the lowest sell order price, the automated spread<br>
21<br><br>
WO 2007/041281	PCT/US2006/038030<br>
trading tool may move the order at the N-th price level to a price level equal to the new<br>
effective price level. Similarly to the embodiments described above, the movement of the<br>
order involves cancellation of the order at the N-th price level, and placement of a new order<br>
at the new effective price level. Also, if the effective price level changes by more than one<br>
tick, more than one order could be moved to new price levels.<br>
Referring to step 724, if the new effective price level is higher than the lowest sell<br>
order price, as shown at 732, the order at the lowest sell order price is moved to a price level<br>
above the N-th order. More than one order could be moved based on the changes of the tick<br>
differential between the effective price level and the lowest sell order price. Finally, at step<br>
736, if the new effective order price is equal to the lowest sell order price, no action is taken.<br>
While not shown in Figure 7, it should be understood that when a leg order gets filled<br>
the remaining "N-l" queue holder orders may be cancelled immediately to avoid any<br>
unwanted fills. Alternatively, a trader may define a trading strategy to include two spread<br>
orders having identical or slightly different desired spread prices. In such an embodiment,<br>
rather than deleting the remaining queue holder orders, the orders can be used in relation to<br>
the second or even third spread trading strategy. For example, if the desired spread prices of<br>
two spread orders using the same queue holder order are slightly different, upon completing<br>
the first spread strategy, some of the remaining queue holder order could be reused for the<br>
second spread strategy, while adding one or more new queue holder orders, based on the<br>
settings defined for the queue holder orders.<br>
C. Spread Configuration Window<br>
Figure 8 is a block diagram illustrating an example spread setup configuration window<br>
800 that can be used by a trader to define a spread. The configuration window 800 shows an<br>
embodiment where a user can configure parameters for a spread having two legs. However, it<br>
should be understood that the example embodiments are not limited to spreads having two<br>
22<br><br>
WO 2007/041281	PCT/US2006/038030<br>
legs, and similar interfaces could be used to configure spreads having more than two legs as<br>
well.<br>
The leg icons 802 and 804 provide status indicators for each leg of the spread. For<br>
example, the status indicators could be color coded to indicate a status corresponding to a<br>
tradeable object of each leg. For example, the icons 802 and 804 can be disabled when a<br>
connection to an exchange providing a tradeable object defined for a leg has not been<br>
established. For example, one color, such as gray, could be used to indicate that no attempt<br>
has been made to activate a tradeable object for trading, a different color, such as yellow,<br>
could be used to indicate that the system is still waiting for response after attempting to<br>
activate the tradeable object for trading, and green could be used to indicate a successful<br>
activation of the tradeable object for trading.<br>
The spread set up configuration window 800 includes a number of fields 806-812 that<br>
can be used to enter information related to a tradeable object in each leg of the spread. The<br>
information in each of the respective fields could be either entered manually or could be<br>
copied from another window interface, such as by dragging and dropping the information to<br>
the set up configuration window 800. The "Gateway" fields 806 under each leg icon 802 and<br>
804 can be used to specify a name of a gateway to be used to receive information related to<br>
each respective tradeable object. The "Gateway" fields could be automatically populated<br>
upon selecting a tradeable object for each leg of the spread. The "Product" fields 808 are<br>
used to define a general category of tradeable object, such as ZF, ZN, or yet some other<br>
product available at electronic exchanges. The "Product Type" fields 810 can be used to<br>
define a type of the product, such as futures, interest rates, etc. As shown in Figure 8, a drop<br>
down menu could be provided to allow selection of different product types. Finally, the<br>
"Contract" fields 812 can be used to define contract identifiers, or product names. For<br>
23<br><br>
WO 2007/041281	PCT7US2006/038030<br>
example, when the product field includes a future product, the "Contract" field 812 could<br>
specify the closing date corresponding to that tradeable object, such as Sep05.<br>
The spread set up configuration window 800 also includes additional fields that can be<br>
used to define a plurality of adjustable parameters. "Customer Account" field 814 can be<br>
used to select a customer account to be used for trading a tradeable object corresponding to<br>
each leg of the spread. According to one example embodiment, the selection choices in the<br>
pull down menu of the Customer Account fields could be automatically populated based on<br>
data available from some other applications, such as an application that a trader uses to log<br>
onto an exchange. "Spread Multiplier" fields 816 can be used to define values for use of<br>
calculating spread prices. "Order Size", fields 818 define the quantity for each leg order. The<br>
plus and minus signs in relation to the defined quantities could be used to define if a leg order<br>
is a buy order or a sell order, respectively.<br>
"Queue Holder" fields 820 can be used to enter the number of levels (order levels) to<br>
be submitted for each leg, as was described in greater detail above. "Volume Multiplier"<br>
fields 822 allow a user to enter a value to be used by the automated spread trading application<br>
to calculate needed volume for a leg before an order corresponding to that leg is placed at a<br>
specific price level. According to one example embodiment, the volume calculations could be<br>
based on the following formula: (Hedge Size*Volume Multiplier + Base Volume), where the<br>
volume multiplier and the base volume variables could be user configurable. For example, if<br>
a hedge size is 7, the minimum quantity of 7 would be normally needed if the volume<br>
multiplier was set to 1 and the base volume was set to 0. Then, assuming that the volume<br>
multiplier was set to 5 with the base volume set to 0, the needed volume at a price would have<br>
to be 35 before the order would be placed at that price. Then, for example, with the volume<br>
multiplier set to 5 and the base volume set to 25, the available quantity at a price would have<br>
to be 60 (7*5+25) before placing an order at that price.<br>
24<br><br>
WO 2007/041281	PCT/US2006/038030<br>
A user could also define additional parameters to be used for preventing continuous<br>
re-quoting of leg orders associated with the synthetic spread. To do that, the user could enter<br>
a tick value in "Inside slop" 824A and "Outside slop" fields 824B. The tick value defined in<br>
"Inside slop" and "Outside slop" fields 824A and 824B can then be used to determine an<br>
acceptable range for the effective price of the leg order. In such an embodiment, if the<br>
effective price of the leg order falls within the acceptable range, the auto-spreader application<br>
does not re-price order. However, if that price falls outside the acceptable range, the leg order<br>
will be re-priced to the new effective price level.<br>
"Inside Anti-Slop" and "Outside Anti-Slop" fields 826A and 826B can be used by a<br>
trader to define a number of ticks to be used in relation to the anti-slop functionality. In<br>
general, the anti-slop, when used, enables a trader to have his/her orders re-quoted when the<br>
effective order price of an order falls close to the current market, i.e., within a predefined<br>
range away from the current inside market or yet some other reference point. Using an inside<br>
anti-slop, an order would be re-quoted if the result of the re-quoting would put the order at a<br>
price level within a predefined range away from the inside market. Using an outside anti-<br>
slop, an order would be re-quoted if a price corresponding to the order before the order is re-<br>
quoted falls within a predefined range away from the inside market.<br>
For example, if the inside anti-slop 826A is set to 4, with the inside market being used<br>
as a reference for a starting point of a range, an order will be re-quoted only if the order's new<br>
price will fall within 4 price levels from the inside market. Then, if the outside anti-slop 826B<br>
is set to 4 while the inside market is still being used as a reference point, if a price<br>
corresponding to an order before the order is being re-quoted falls within 4 price levels from<br>
the inside market, the order will be re-quoted to a new price. Similarly to the slop, the anti-<br>
slop could be used by a trader to reduce the number of times an order is re-quoted based on<br>
changing market conditions.<br>
25<br><br>
WO 2007/041281	PCT/US2006/038030<br>
The queue holder functionality of placing "N" orders for each leg could be manually<br>
or automatically disabled based on one or more conditions. Using the set up window 800, a<br>
user could use "Auto Break" fields 828 to define a maximum number of ticks a price can<br>
move in a single update before the market is deemed to be too volatile for use of the queue<br>
holder functionality. However, it should be understood that different conditions could be<br>
applied as well, and some conditions could be based on a user-defined equation having one or<br>
more predefined variables.<br>
The set up window 800 may also display current market conditions for the tradeable<br>
objects corresponding to each leg of the spread. The extent of the market information can be<br>
user-configurable. The set up window 800 includes "Best Bid" 830, "Best Ask" 832, and last<br>
traded price "Last" 834. However, it should be understood that additional market related<br>
parameters could be provided as well, and the example embodiments are not limited to the<br>
shown variables.<br>
A trader could also define actions to be taken in relation to each leg of the spread. For<br>
example, as shown in Figure 8, a trader could activate "Active Quote" fields 836 with respect<br>
to each leg of the spread. When active quoting is activated fora spread leg, an order may be<br>
submitted to that leg, and the leg order will be re-quoted based on market changes in the other<br>
leg(s) of the spread. Once the leg order gets filled, an offset order is sent to the other leg. It<br>
should be understood that active quoting could be activated and used simultaneously in<br>
relation to two or more leg orders defined for a spread. The set up configuration window 800<br>
also includes "Cancel/Replace" fields 838 that can be activated by a trader to indicate the<br>
mode of order entry in relation to N queue orders. If the "Cancel/Replace" fields 838 are not<br>
activated, a different mode, such as an order change, could be used.<br>
"Hedge Down" fields 840 can be activated so that the automated spreader application<br>
can do partial fill hedge quantity calculations by rounding the quantity down. For example,<br>
26<br><br>
WO 2007/041281	PCT/US2006/038030<br>
when the "Hedge Down" 840 is activated, in relation to a 10:1 spread, and a quantity of 7 has<br>
been filled in relation to a first leg of the spread, no hedge (offset) order would be sent to the<br>
second leg of the spread until the entire quantity of 10 is filled. If the fields 840 are not<br>
activated, default parameters, such as rounding hedge quantities on partial fills, or yet some<br>
other functionality, could be used as well. Referring back to the above example, but now<br>
using the rounding functionality, if the quantity of 7 is filled on the first leg of the spread, a<br>
hedge order having an order quantity of 1 would be sent to the second leg of the spread, with<br>
no action taken when the remaining quantity of 3 is finally filled. Different embodiments are<br>
possible as well.<br>
The spread configuration window 800 also includes a spread calculation pull down<br>
menu 842 that can be used.by a trader to select a basis for calculating spread related prices.<br>
For example, as shown at 842, a trader could select implied prices as the basis. However,<br>
different embodiments are possible as well, such as using a net change or divide that divides<br>
prices corresponding to one leg of the spread by prices of the other leg to be used as the basis<br>
in the spread price calculations. It should be understood that different embodiments are<br>
possible as well.<br>
D. Order Ticket Window<br>
According to one example embodiment, a trader could configure and submit synthetic<br>
spread orders via an order ticket window. As will be described in greater detail below,<br>
different order entry mechanisms could be used as well, such as submitting a synthetic spread<br>
order directly through a market depth trading window.<br>
Figure 9 is a block diagram illustrating an example order ticket 900 that can be used to<br>
enter spread orders according to one example embodiment. The order ticket 900 can be user<br>
configurable, and a trader could save different order tickets under different workspaces that<br>
could be activated based on the trader's preferences.<br>
27<br><br>
WO 2007/041281	PCT/US2006/038030<br>
The order ticket 900 includes a price field 902 that can be used to define a desired<br>
price for a synthetic spread. A user could adjust the price value using the plus and minus<br>
buttons. Also, the value in the price field 902 can be automatically populated based on a<br>
predefined formula. According to one example embodiment, based on the price entered in the<br>
price field 902, "Buy" and "Sell" buttons 922 and 924 can be disabled to ensure that spread<br>
submission does not cross the market. For example, if a current best bid for a spread is at 99,<br>
and a price entered in the price field 902 is 100, the "Buy" button could be disabled to prevent<br>
a trader from entering an order that would cross the current market. A trader could override<br>
the crossing the market limitation by making a predetermined selection input, such as<br>
selecting one or more predefined keys.<br>
"Quantity" field 904 allows a trader to enter a desired number of spreads to be bought<br>
or sold. According to one example embodiment, a quantity tool tip could be used to provide a<br>
user with the current state of the queue holder, such as "working," "done," "ready," etc.<br>
"Queue Holders" field 906 can be used to define a number of price levels (orders) to be<br>
submitted for each leg. If all legs of the spread have the same number of queue holders, as<br>
" defined in relation to Figure 8, the queue holder value at 906 could reflect the defined value.<br>
Also, if the same value was defined for both legs of the spread in relation to Figure 8, a user<br>
could overwrite that value by defining a new queue holder number in the field 906.<br>
The order ticket 900 also includes "Pay Up Tick" fields 908 that allow a trader to<br>
define pay up ticks to be used; in relation to each hedge order submitted for each leg of the<br>
synthetic spread. Each value in the "Pay Up" field defines the number of ticks that a trader is<br>
willing to pay beyond the basis of the limit price to complete a spread, or, in other words, an<br>
acceptable range of prices for the offset order. In one example embodiment, the basis price of<br>
the limit order may be based on a price that will achieve the desired spread price.<br>
28<br><br>
WO 2007/041281	PCT/US2006/038030<br>
Alternatively, the basis price for limit orders could be based on the inside market (either the<br>
best offer in the case of a bid or the best bid in the case of an offer).<br>
Using the pay-up ticks, a price for a limit order may be established by adding the pay-<br>
up tick value to the basis of a buy order and subtracted from the basis of the sell order. In<br>
other words, the pay-up ticks allow a trader to set a level of tolerance with respect to getting<br>
an order filled. According to one example embodiment, a trader could define the pay up ticks<br>
to be negative or positive. The order ticket 900 also includes "Fractional Negative Pay-Up<br>
Ticks" fields 910, a "Scalping" field 912, and a "Smart Hedge" field 914, each of which will<br>
be described below in the "Additional Trading'Tools" section.<br>
"Base Volume" fields 916 allow a user to dynamically adjust the base volume for each<br>
tradeable object corresponding to a leg of the spread. According to one example embodiment,<br>
the base volume can be used to determine a minimum quantity that is required in an<br>
appropriate offset queue in order for the spread to be quoted there. It should be understood<br>
that the base volume could be set manually or automatically based on a user-defined equation.<br>
The required volume can then be calculated using the formula described in greater above:<br>
(Order Size) * (Volume Multiplier) + (Base Volume). However, different formulas could be<br>
used as well. In the provided example, a trader could define any value to be used as the<br>
volume multiplier variable.<br>
A "Delete All" field 918 allows a trader to clear all settings entered via the order ticket<br>
900. "Hedge Fills" 920 can be used to activate sending of a hedge order when one leg is<br>
filled. When the "Hedge Fills" field 920 is disabled, orders can still be quoting in the market;<br>
however, if an order is filled, a hedge order is not submitted. This functionality may be useful<br>
when a trader wants to place an offsetting order manually, because the trader, for example,<br>
believes that the market is moving in the favorable direction, and the trader may make an<br>
extra profit by submitting the offsetting order manually as compared to an order that would be<br>
29<br><br>
WO 2007/041281	PCT/US2006/038030<br>
placed automatically by the spread trading tool. Also, it should be understood that the hedge<br>
fills functionality can be controlled automatically based on the user-defined formula(s). For<br>
example, certain conditions may be used to deactivate hedging of orders.<br>
The order ticket 900 also indicates the current state of the market corresponding to the<br>
spread. "Bid," "Ask," and "Last" fields 922, 924, and 926 indicate the calculated spread<br>
prices. It should be understood that different methods could be used to calculate the spread<br>
related data, all of which are commonly known in the art. The values in each of these fields<br>
could be automatically populated from an application that computes spread related data based<br>
on market data corresponding to a tradeable object of each leg defined for the spread.<br>
A trader could select a "Buy" icon 928 or a "Sell" icon 930 to indicate if the spread is<br>
a buy or a sell. It should be understood that the order ticket 900 could include additional<br>
selection options and is not limited to the illustrated parameters. The order ticket 900 also<br>
includes an alert selection icon 932 that can be used by a trader to select one or more events<br>
that could trigger an activation of an alert. The events could be based on the market, trader's<br>
performance, or yet some other criteria. Also, a trader could select from a number of alert<br>
options, such as a sound alert, a visual alert, or a combination thereof.<br>
VII. Additional Trading Tools<br>
A. Fractional Pay-up Ticks<br>
As described above, an automated spread trading tool may compute an order price for<br>
one leg based on market conditions of a second leg. When the order in the first leg fills, the<br>
spread trading tool automatically sends an order to the second leg. The price of the order in<br>
the second leg is usually set to a market price so that the order in the second leg can get filled<br>
immediately or soon after placement. Sometimes a trader will use pay up- ticks to provide<br>
further assurance that the second order will get filled as soon as possible, thereby completing<br>
the spread. In other words, if the market changes in the second leg before the second order<br>
30<br><br>
WO 2007/041281	PCT/US2006/038030<br>
actually gets placed at the exchange, the trader may have missed an opportunity. By using<br>
pay up ticks, the trader is willing to "give up" a certain number of ticks to get the second<br>
order filled.<br>
There may be some instances when a trader wants the offsetting order to get filled, but<br>
is also willing to take some risk to get a more desirable fill price for the offsetting order. To<br>
do so, the trader may use fractional pay-up ticks. Fractional pay-up ticks divides the<br>
offsetting order quantity according to certain percentages. Then, a portion of the offsetting<br>
order quantity will be placed at one price, such as the market price (or the original price set<br>
for the offsetting order), and the other portion(s) will be placed at other price levels (e.g., at<br>
more desirable prices or even a less desirable prices if so programmed and the market moves<br>
accordingly). As an example, "Fractional Negative Pay-Up Ticks" fields 910 are shown in<br>
relation to Figure 9. It should be understood that the use of fractional pay-up ticks is not<br>
limited to the use with spread orders that use the queue holder functionality.<br>
A trader could use the functionality of the fractional negative/positive pay-up ticks to<br>
hedge a preset fraction of a offsetting leg order's quantity using predefined negative or<br>
positive pay-up ticks, while the remaining offsetting leg order's quantity will be submitted at<br>
an effective spread leg order price or yet another pay up tick defined for the leg order. It<br>
should be understood that the fractions to be used in relation to each leg order could be<br>
dynamically set based on user-defined formulas. The variables in the formulas could be based<br>
on market conditions, or user risk related data, such as a current profit level, a net position, or<br>
yet some other conditions. It should be understood that fractional pay-up ticks could be<br>
defined for each leg of the spread.<br>
To illustrate one example embodiment how the fractional negative pay up ticks could<br>
be used, let's assume that a trader defines a synthetic spread with an order quantity of 10, a<br>
spread ratio 1:1, a desired spread price of 0, and both legs ticking in l's. In relation to the<br>
31<br><br>
WO 2007/041281	PC1YUS2006/038030<br>
pay-up tick configuration, let's assume that the pay-up tick value for the spread is set to 1,<br>
with the fractional ratio set to 61%, and the fractional pay-up tick value set to -1. Upon<br>
entering a spread buy order, let's assume that a spread trading tool placed a buy order having<br>
a quantity of 10 at 100 for "leg 1" of the spread, and the buy "leg 1" order was filled.<br>
Normally, with no pay-up ticks defined, the spread trading tool would attempt to sell the<br>
quantity of 10 at 100 for "leg 2" to achieve the desired spread price of 0. With a pay-up tick<br>
set to 1, a trader is willing to "pay" an extra tick in order to get the spread, so the sell order for<br>
"leg 2" having an order quantity of 10 would be placed by the spread trading tool at the price<br>
of99.<br>
However, because the fractional pay-up ticks are used, only a portion of the quantity<br>
of 10 will be submitted at the price of 99. The spread trading tool may use the fractional ratio<br>
of 61% to calculate a fractional pay-up tick quantity, in this example 6.1 (0.61*10) that can be<br>
rounded down to 6 (it should be understood that the rounding mechanism could be user-<br>
configurable). Thus, using the fractional pay-up ticks applied in this example, the quantity of<br>
6 would be submitted with a first sell "leg 2" order, a fractional hedge order, at 101 (100-(-<br>
1)), and the quantity of 4 would be submitted with a second sell "leg 2" order at 99 (100-1).<br>
To illustrate another example embodiment, let's assume that a trader defines a<br>
synthetic spread having the same spread settings, i.e., the quantity of 10, the spread ratio of<br>
1:1, the desired spread price of 0, and both legs ticking in Is. In relation to the pay-up tick<br>
configuration, let's now assume that the pay-up tick value for the spread is set to 2, with the<br>
fractional ratio set to 39%, and the fractional pay-up tick set to 3. Let's also assume that the<br>
synthetic spread order was a sell order, and that a.sell spread order for "leg 1" having an order<br>
quantity of 10 at the price level of 100 was entered and got filled. As explained in the<br>
preceding example, if no pay-up ticks were defined, the spread trading tool would attempt to<br>
buy the quantity of 10 at the price of 100 for "leg 2" of the spread. With a pay-up tick set to<br>
32<br><br>
WO 2007/041281	PCT/US2006/038030<br>
2, a trader is basically willing to pay extra 2 ticks in order to get the spread, so the spread<br>
trading tool would enter a buy order having an order quantity of 10 at the price of 102 for "leg<br>
2." However, once again, because fractional pay-up ticks are used, the quantity<br>
corresponding to "leg 2" will be divided based on the fractional ratio. Based on the fractional<br>
ratio, 39%, in this example, the trading tool would submit two buy orders for "leg 2," with the<br>
first buy order, a fractional hedge order, having the quantity of 3 (0.39*10=3.9 with the<br>
rounding down enabled) at the price of 103 (100+3), and the second buy order having the<br>
quantity of 7 at the price of 102 (100+2).<br>
It should be understood that the above examples are only illustrations, and the<br>
fractional pay-up ticks' functionality is not limited to the provided examples. For example,<br>
fractional pay-up ticks could be used in relation to synthetic spreads having more than two<br>
legs.<br>
B. Scalping<br>
The order ticket 900 also includes a "Scalping" field 912 that can be activated by a<br>
trader for each spread leg order. When the "Scalping" field 912 is selected and one of the legs<br>
of the spread is at least partially filled, the auto-spreader application may generate both a<br>
scalping order and an offset order. An offset order is an order that is placed in relation to a<br>
second leg of the spread to achieve a desired spread price. A scalping order, as used herein,<br>
refers to an order that is placed in relation to a tradeable object corresponding to a leg for<br>
which a fill was detected, and that is used to offset a position created with the fill. Thus, a<br>
scalping order may be used to limit the risk of not getting filled on the other leg of the spread.<br>
According to one example embodiment, a scalping order and an offset order are<br>
submitted to each respective matching process at one or more electronic exchanges upon<br>
detecting a fill in one of the legs of the spread. It should be understood that a trader could<br>
pre-configure a price level at which a scalping order is to be entered, and a price level for the<br>
33<br><br>
WO 2007/041281	PCT7US2006/038030<br>
offset order may be dynamically determined by the spread trading tool based on the spread<br>
configuration parameters. The two orders are then logically linked to manage an order<br>
quantity of each order upon detecting a fill in relation to the two orders. More specifically,<br>
the management of fills may involve monitoring fills of each linked order and dynamically<br>
lowering an order quantity in a first linked order upon detecting a fill in the second linked<br>
order. For example, a fill of the entire quantity in relation to an offset order may cause<br>
cancellation of the scalping order.<br>
To illustrate the scalping functionality with an example, let's assume that a trader is<br>
trading a 2:1 spread, and a quantity of 10 corresponding to a buy order has been filled for the<br>
first leg of the spread at a price level of 100. To offset a position created with the first leg, the<br>
spread trading tool may determine a price level for an sell offset order based on a desired<br>
spread price, and send the sell offset order having a quantity of 5 (based on the 2:1 ratio) at<br>
the calculated price. In addition to the sell offset order, a sell scalping order would also be<br>
sent to the market corresponding to a tradeable object of the first leg of the spread. According<br>
to one example embodiment, a price level for the sell scalping order could be determined<br>
based on one or more user precohfigured rules. For example, a trader may wish to submit a<br>
sell in relation to the scalping order at a price that is one or more ticks higher than the price at<br>
which the buy order corresponding to the first leg of the spread has been filled. Also, the<br>
quantity of the scalping order is set to the quantity value that was filled in relation to the order<br>
corresponding to the first leg, which, according to this example, Would be set to 10.<br>
Let's assume that the sell scalping order having a quantity of 10 was submitted at a<br>
price of 101, while the offset order having a quantity of 5 was submitted at the calculated<br>
price for the second leg of the spread. As explained above, the sell scalping order and the<br>
second leg order are linked for quantity management purposes.<br>
34<br><br>
WO 2007/041281	PCTYUS2006/038030<br>
Let's now assume that a quantity of 3 has been filled in relation to the order<br>
corresponding to the second leg of the spread. Based on the preconfigured spread ratio 2:1,<br>
the quantity corresponding to the sell scalping order would be responsively reduced by 6 by<br>
sending a change and replace request to the matching process to replace the existing sell<br>
scalping order with a new sell scalping order having a new quantity of 4 at the price of 101.<br>
Then, let's assume that the full quantity of 4 has been afterwards filled with respect to the sell<br>
scalping order. Responsively to the fill, the sell order having the remaining quantity of 2<br>
pending for the second leg of the spread would be cancelled.<br>
While the example provided above describes an embodiment where a single scalping<br>
order is sent, it should be understood that multiple scalping orders having a total quantity<br>
equal to the desired quantity could also be sent at a plurality of price levels. For example,<br>
referring to the example provided above, a first scalping order having a quantity of 5 could be<br>
submitted at a price level of 101, and a second scalping order having also a quantity of 5<br>
could be submitted at a price level of 102. Different embodiments are possible as well.<br>
C. Smart Hedging<br>
As described above, an automated trading tool may send an order in one leg of the<br>
spread and when that order gets filled (or matched), the automated trading tool automatically<br>
sends an offsetting order to the other leg of the spread. Generally, this offsetting order is<br>
placed at a market price so that it can fill as soon as possible. Once the offsetting order gets<br>
filled, the spread is complete. Sometimes, pay-up ticks are used (such as described above) to<br>
increase the chances of the offsetting order getting filled.<br>
Additionally, some auto-spreader applications are configured to actively quote all legs<br>
of the spread at the same time to increase the chances of achieving the spread. Using the<br>
above example, the automated trading tool would send an order in each leg of the spread and<br>
when one of the leg orders gets filled, the automated trading tool would automatically send an<br>
35<br><br>
WO 2007/041281	PCT/US2006/038030<br>
offsetting order to the other leg of the spread (similar to the example above), but also would<br>
cancel the remaining leg orders so as not to get double filled. However, in many instances,<br>
such as when pay-up ticks are used in relation to the leg orders, the existing order in the<br>
offsetting leg of the spread may be at a price level that achieves the desired spread price.<br>
Thus, deleting such an order may result in the loss of the valuable queue position that a trader<br>
could have had if the order was not deleted.<br>
According to one example embodiment, a trader may activate smart hedging when<br>
defining a spread such that an order already placed in a leg can be used as the "offsetting<br>
order." The smart hedging functionality could be activated with respect to each leg of the<br>
spread, as shown in Figure 9. When the smart hedging field is activated while the two legs<br>
are being actively quoted, and one of the leg orders gets fully or partially filled, the spread<br>
trading application may determine if the order pending in the other leg of the spread is at a<br>
price level that results in the desired spread price. The auto spreader application may also<br>
check if a quantity corresponding to the pending order is sufficient to offset the fill quantity.<br>
If the pending order is at a preferred price level and the quantity is at least equal to that<br>
' needed to offset the fill, the order will be left unmodified and an offsetting order will not be<br>
sent to that leg - instead the already pending order in that leg will be used as the "offsetting<br>
order." If the quantity is less than needed, the auto spreader application may submit another<br>
order at that price to achieve a desired spread. If the pending order is not at a price level that<br>
would result in the desired spread price, the pending order would be cancelled and a new<br>
order would be placed at the calculated order price that achieves the desired spread price.<br>
To illustrate how the smart hedging works, let's assume that two leg orders having<br>
order quantities of 5 are being actively quoted for a 1:1 spread. Also, let's assume that an<br>
order quantity of 3 gets filled in the first leg order. Upon detecting the fill in the first leg, the<br>
auto spreader application will determine if the order pending at the second leg is at a price<br>
36<br><br>
WO 2007/041281	PCT7US2006/038030<br>
level that would result in the desired spread price. Assuming that it is, the order<br>
corresponding to the second leg would be left unchanged and a new offsetting order will not<br>
be sent. Then, if the auto spreader application determines that the second leg of the spread is<br>
to be re-quoted, the auto spreader may lower the quantity of the existing order to 3 and send a<br>
new order having an order quantity of 2 at a new price for the second leg. The auto spreader<br>
application may lower the order quantity corresponding to the second leg order by sending a<br>
change command to the matching engine.<br>
It should be understood that when the smart hedging functionality is used when queue<br>
holder orders are submitted with respect to the second spread leg, the order quantity of each<br>
queue holder order would be modified upon detecting a fill with respect to the first leg order.<br>
For example, in relation to the example provided above, a change request to change an order<br>
quantity from 5 to 2 would be sent to a matching process for each queue holder order upon<br>
detecting the fill of 3 with respect to the first leg order. It should be understood that different<br>
embodiments are possible as well.<br>
VIII. Market Depth Order Entry<br>
While an order ticket is one method that can be used by a trader to enter spread orders,<br>
the trader could enter orders using different methods as well. One such method involves<br>
entering spread order via a graphical interface that displays market information associated<br>
with a predefined spread, such as a graphical interface 1000 illustrated in Figure 10.<br>
However, it should be understood that different graphical interfaces that allow a trader to<br>
enter orders could be used as well.<br>
The graphical interface 1000 is an example trading screen and includes a value axis<br>
1002 that indicates values representing prices or some other derivative of price, such as yield,<br>
determined for the spread. The prices or some other derivatives of price for the spread are<br>
determined based on market data of the underlying tradeable objects defined for the spread,<br>
37<br><br>
WO 2007/041281	PCXTJS2006/038030<br>
the methods of which are commonly known in the art. While the values are displayed along a<br>
vertically oriented axis, the values may be displayed along a horizontally oriented axis or<br>
along an axis positioned at some other angle. Once the value axis 1002 is generated, quantity<br>
and price information contained in the market data feeds corresponding to tradeable objects of<br>
the spread is received and used to calculate spread data. The calculated data is then used to<br>
populate the display against the value axis 1002. As new quantity and price information<br>
arrives from the electronic exchange, the graphical interface 1000 is preferably updated to<br>
reflect any market changes.<br>
The graphical interface 1000 includes a bid quantity column 1004 and an ask quantity<br>
column 1006 that display bid and ask quantities, respectively. The bid and a.sk quantities are<br>
displayed in the locations that correspond to their respective value or price levels along the<br>
value axis 1002. By looking at the graphical interface 1000, the trader can quickly locate the<br>
inside market, which refers to the highest bid price and the lowest ask price, which in the<br>
example shown in Figure 10 correspond to prices 30 and 35, respectively. Further, using the<br>
graphical interface 1000, a trader can view how much quantity is available at various price<br>
levels. For example, following the best bid and the best ask, there is a bid quantity of 52 at<br>
the price level of 29, and an ask quantity of 29 at a price level of 36. Other levels of market<br>
depth are also shown, as illustrated in Figure 10.<br>
The graphical interface 1000 also shows additional parameters, such as a working<br>
quantity column 1008 that illustrates a working buy order indicator 1010 having an order<br>
quantity of 10 at the price level of 30. The interface 1000 also includes a last traded quantity<br>
column 1012 that, in this example, displays a last traded quantity indicator 1014<br>
corresponding to the quantity of 5 that was traded at a price level of 35. In addition to the<br>
indicators described above, the interface 1000 includes a default quantity field 1016, a number<br>
of quantity selection icons 1018, a clear all "CLR" icon 1020, and a delete all orders ("Del<br>
38<br><br>
WO 2007/041281	PCT/US2006/038030<br>
All") icon 1022. It should be understood that additional indicators could be provided in<br>
relation to the interface 1000, and what is actually shown in the interface 1000 could be user<br>
configurable.<br>
As the market conditions of the tradeable objects underlying the spread change, the<br>
bid and ask quantity indicators in the bid quantity column 1004 and the ask quantity column<br>
1006 move relative to the value axis 1002. Thus, a trader can easily tell, among many other<br>
things, if the market has moved up or down. A trading screen similar to that shown in Figure<br>
10 is commercially available as MD Traderâ„¢ in the XJTRADERÂ® product offered by<br>
Trading Technologies International, Inc. of Chicago, Illinois. Further, various aspects of the<br>
trading screen in Figure 10, including the dynamic movement of the bid and offer indicators<br>
against an axis, are described in U.S. Patent 6,772,132. Adjustable viewing of the axes,<br>
including the consolidation of price levels and quantities, is described in U.S. Patent<br>
Application No. 09/971,087, filed on October 5, 2001, and entitled, "Click Based Trading<br>
with Intuitive Grid Display of Market Depth and Price Consolidation." A variety of trading<br>
tools that can be used with the trading screen to assist in visualizing the market are further<br>
described in U.S. Patent Application No. 10/125,894, filed on April 19, 2002, and entitled,<br>
"Trading Tools for Electronic Trading." The entire content of each of the above-referenced<br>
applications is incorporated herein by reference.	The intuitiveness of the example<br>
trading screen shown in Figure 10 results from the dynamic display of quantities shown in the<br>
bid column 1004 and ask column 1006 positioned along the value axis 1002. Locations in<br>
alignment to the values along the value axis 1002 are, in essence, fixed in relation to the value<br>
or price levels. For example, a location in the ask column 1012 corresponding to the price<br>
level of 35 is fixed to the price of 35. Similar applies to the location in the bid column 1004<br>
corresponding to the price level of 35. While the locations in the bid and ask columns are<br>
shown horizontally to the location of the corresponding price level, different embodiments are<br>
39<br><br>
WO 2007/041281	PCT/US2006/038030<br>
possible as well. For example, the locations corresponding to a specific price level could be<br>
positioned at some angle. As the market climbs up or down in value, the user can quickly<br>
view the change since the indicators in the bid and ask quantity columns 1004 and 1006 will<br>
move up or down, respectively, along the value axis 1002 to reflect the market change.<br>
If the market starts to go out of view, the market can be re-positioned along the value<br>
axis 1002, responsive to which, the locations will become fixed in relation to a new set of<br>
price levels. Repositioning of the market information may occur automatically or manually.<br>
It should also be noted that the layout of different columns in Figure 10 is only an example<br>
layout, and the columns could be repositioned, so that the bid, ask, and value columns could<br>
be rearranged. For example, the bid column 1004 could be next to the ask column 1006.<br>
To enter an order using the graphical interface 1000, a trader can preset a default<br>
quantity at 1016 using quantity selection icons 1018, and then using an input device, select a<br>
cell in the bid or ask column corresponding to a desired price of the order. For example, if the<br>
cell in the bid column 1004 associated with the price level of 30 is selected, then a buy spread<br>
order having an order quantity of 10 (determined based on the default quantity at 1016) would<br>
be automatically entered. A working order icon, such as the one at 1010, would then be<br>
displayed in the working order column 1008. A trader could similarly enter a sell spread<br>
order by selecting a desired cell in the ask column 1006.<br>
According to one example embodiment, a mouse input device could be used to<br>
position a cursor over a cell and upon selection of the mouse button (either upon the down<br>
stroke of the mouse button or upon release of the button, however programmed), a spread<br>
order may be submitted for processing by the automated spread trading application. Once the<br>
spread trading application processes the spread orders and determines order parameters for<br>
each individual leg of the spread, the orders for each tradeable object corresponding to the<br>
spread may be submitted to their respective electronic exchanges. In the example<br>
40<br><br>
WO 2007/041281	PCT7US2006/038030<br>
embodiment described above, a trader could distinguish a buy order from a sell order by<br>
selecting a location in either the bid column 1004 or the ask column 1006, respectively. In<br>
another example embodiment, buttons on the input device could be programmed so that when<br>
a particular button is pressed, it sends a buy order, and when another button is pressed, it<br>
sends an ask order.<br>
In yet another example embodiment, a keyboard may have keys that are associated<br>
with the price levels displayed on the graphical interface, and a trader could initiate a spread<br>
order by selecting the keys. According to the example embodiment, initiating a spread order<br>
includes sending leg orders to one or more host exchanges once the spread trading application<br>
processes the spread order parameters to determine order parameters for each leg order. It<br>
should be understood that before an order is sent to an exchange, different applications, such<br>
as a risk management tool, or yet some other application, could be programmed to process the<br>
order and prevent the order from being sent to the exchange if certain criteria occur.<br>
Figure 11 is a block diagram illustrating two trading interfaces 1100 and 1102 that will<br>
be used to describe a method for placing queue holder orders in relation to a tradeable object<br>
that was defined for one leg of a spread.<br>
The trading interfaces 1100 and 1102 are of the type illustrated in Figure 10; however,<br>
it should be understood that the example embodiments are not limited to any order entry<br>
mechanism. In the example embodiment, it is assumed that the market data displayed in the<br>
interfaces 1100 and 1102 corresponds to two tradeable objects that underlie the spread market<br>
data illustrated in relation to Figure 10.<br>
Referring back to Figure 10, when a trader enters a spread order having an order<br>
quantity of 10 at a spread price level of 30, the automatic spread trading tool may process the<br>
spread order and use the market information corresponding to the second tradeable object in<br>
Figure 11 to determine a price level for a first spread leg order to achieve a desired spread<br>
41<br><br>
WO 2007/041281	PCT/US2006/038030<br>
price. More specifically, as shown in Figure 11, with the best bid corresponding to the second<br>
tradeable object at the price level of 75, a buy spread leg order for the first tradeable object is<br>
calculated to be at the price level of 105 to achieve the desired spread price of 30. Based on<br>
the example embodiments, in addition to submitting the buy spread leg order for the first<br>
tradeable object, as shown at 1104, three additional order queue holder orders are submitted<br>
as well. According to the example embodiment illustrated in Figure 11, the three additional<br>
orders are submitted at three consecutive price levels below the price level of 105. Three<br>
working queue holder orders for the spread leg of the first tradeable object are shown at 1106,<br>
1108, and 1110. As explained earlier, the number of queue holder orders is based on user<br>
configuration, and fewer or more queue holder orders could be submitted to the electronic<br>
exchange as well.<br>
Figure 12 is a block diagram illustrating two trading interfaces 1200 and 1202 that will<br>
be used to illustrate how queue holder orders are modified upon detecting a change in market<br>
conditions. More specifically, as illustrated in Figure 12, market data corresponding to the<br>
tradeable object shown in relation to the trading interface 1202 has moved such that the best<br>
bid is now at the price level of 74 as compared to the earlier price level of 1102, as shown at<br>
the interface 1102 of Figure 11. As the market moves, the auto-spreader application may<br>
calculate a new spread leg order price, which, according to this example embodiment, falls at<br>
104. However, rather than placing a new spread leg order at that price, there is already an<br>
existing queue holder order pending at that price, the order 1106 shown in Figure 11. To<br>
maintain the preset queue holder number of 4, a new order 1210 at the price level of 101 is<br>
submitted. As shown in Figure 4, there are four currently pending orders at the price levels of<br>
104, 103, 102, and 101, with the orders 1204, 1206, and 1208 corresponding to the earlier<br>
placed queue holder orders 1106,1108, and 1110 that were shown in relation to Figure 11.<br>
42<br><br>
WO 2007/041281	PCT/US2006/038030<br>
While the spread orders are being executed, a trader could also view an execution<br>
status of a spread via a status interface. Figure 13 is a block diagram illustrating an example<br>
graphical interface 1300 that shows an execution status corresponding to a spread order and<br>
that allows a trader to perform additional operations related to the spread order.<br>
The graphical interface 1300 includes a price field 1302 that shows a spread price<br>
level. The background of the price field 1302 could be color-coded to indicate if the spread is<br>
being bought or sold. According to one example embodiment, "Quantity" field 1306, "Queue<br>
Holder" field 1308, and "Spread Calculation" field 1322 are fixed and cannot be changed<br>
during the execution of the spread. A trader can view the quantity covered for each of the<br>
legs via quantity field 1304. The covered quantity field could also be linked to another<br>
computing application that can use the filled quantities in some other calculations.<br>
The interface 1300 also displays "Pay-Up" tick values and "Base Volume" that are<br>
used in relation to each leg of the spread, as shown at 1312 and 1314. A trader could also<br>
delete all spread leg orders pending at the exchange(s) by selecting "Delete All" field 1316.<br>
"Hedge fills" field 1320 can be activated to automatically send a hedge order in the spread leg<br>
for which the field 1320 is activated upon a fill of the spread order in the other leg. A trader<br>
could deactivate the "Hedge fills" functionality if the trader, for example, does not want to<br>
submit an offsetting order in the other leg of the spread, but rather wants to manually submit<br>
an offsetting order in the leg for which a fill was detected to potentially make profit on<br>
changing market conditions in that leg. The interface 1300 also provides "Sounds" field 1324<br>
to activate different sounds that can be played to alert a user when different user-configured<br>
events are detected.<br>
Using a typical automated spread trading application, and depending on the market<br>
conditions of each tradeable object underlying the spread, the spread leg orders may be often<br>
re-quoted to achieve a desired spread price. However, in some instances, a trader may wish to<br>
43<br><br>
WO 2007/041281	PCT/US2006/038030<br>
complete a spread trade even if the currently pending orders will not result in the desired<br>
spread price. A trader could manually stop quoting each leg of the spread by selecting "Stop<br>
Requoting" field 1318. According to one example embodiment, selection of the "Stop<br>
Requoting" field 1318 may result in freezing of all queue holder orders at their current price<br>
levels. When quoting is disabled, a trader could once again restart quoting by selecting the<br>
"Stop Requoting" field 1318.<br>
According to another example embodiment, the stop quoting functionality could be<br>
activated automatically upon detecting one or more user-defined stop quoting conditions. For<br>
example, the stop quoting conditions could be based on order related status, such as when one<br>
of the orders crosses the inside market, or when a trader selects "Delete All" field 1316. Also,<br>
requoting may be stopped when all legs have been filled, or upon detecting an error from<br>
another application, such as Excel. The requoting could also be stopped based on exchange<br>
related conditions, such as, when submission of an order failed. The stop requoting<br>
conditions could also be based on market depth corresponding to one or more tradeable<br>
objects underlying a spread. One such criterion could be based on thin depth, which may be<br>
detected when a total quantity available at the first price level of the queue holder order is not<br>
sufficient to support the spread. The thin depth may be calculated based on a user-defined<br>
equation, such as the one described earlier. Also, another stop requoting condition could be<br>
based on market volatility, such as when the price movement of one or more tradeable objects<br>
underlying a leg is higher than a user defined value. According to another embodiment, the<br>
stop requoting functionality could be activated based on the movement of queue holder<br>
orders. For example, the stop requoting could be automatically activated if one of a queue<br>
holder orders has to be moved more than twice the number of queue holders, or yet some<br>
other user-defined number, in a single move. It should be understood that different conditions<br>
could be programmed as well to automatically trigger the stop requoting functionality.<br>
