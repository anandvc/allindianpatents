INTAKE MANIFOLD FOR MULTIPLE-CYLINDER INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD [0001]<br>
The present invention relates to an intake manifold, for a multiple-cylinder internal combustion engine, having a collective part forming an intake gas distribution chamber, and a plurality of branch intake pipes branching out from the collective part and forming branch intake passages for carrying an intake gas to combustion chambers.<br>
BACKGROUND ART [0002]<br>
An intake manifold, for a multiple-cylinder internal combustion engine, is disclosed in, for example. Patent Document 1, which intake manifold is provided with a guide to ensure smooth flow of intake gas from the intake manifold to the combustion chambers. [0003]<br>
Patent Document 1: JP 2003-74431 A<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
UNDERLYING PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION [0004]<br><br>
In some intake manifold, for a multiple-cylinder internal combustion engine, having a collective part forming an intake gas distribution chamber and provided with an intake inlet, and a plurality of branch intake pipes branching out from the collective part and forming a plurality of branch intake passages branching out from the intake gas distribution chamber, corners of the collective part are formed in a special shape, such as a squarish shape, to ensure a sufficient rigidity for the collective part to which a negative intake pressure acts. When the branch intake pipes are formed integrally with the collective part, the shape of the collective part is determined so as to be easily molded to facilitate removing a core for molding the branch intake pipes and to avoid increasing the cost of the intake manifold due to the complicated shape of the mold.  In some cases, the corners need to be formed in a special shape, such as a squarish shape, to prevent interference between the core and the collective part. [0005]<br>
However, a shape of the collective part determined from the viewpoint of rigidity and molding sometimes obstructs the smooth flow of intake gas in the collective part, reducing the volumetric efficiency of the engine. [0006]<br>
The present invention has been made in view of such a<br><br>
problem and it is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an intake manifold having a collective part of split case construction ensuring smooth flow of intake gas ther¬ethrough to improve volumetric efficiency regardless of the shape of corners of the collective part.<br>
MEANS TO SOLVE THE UNDERLYING PROBLEM [0007]<br>
The present invention provides an intake manifold, for a multiple-cylinder internal combustion engine, having a collective part defining an intake gas distribution chamber having an intake gas inlet, and a branch intake part having a plurality of branch intake passages respectively for carrying an intake gas to combustion chambers; wherein the collective part is built by joining together first and second sections respectively defining first and second spaces forming the intake gas distribution chamber, at least the first section is integrally provided with a corner part, the second section is provided with a guide wall extending in the first and the second section so as to cover an inside surface of the corner part, and the guide wall has a guide surface for guiding the intake gas more smoothly than the inside surface of the corner part. [0008]<br>
Preferably, the plurality of branch intake passages are arranged in an arranging direction in which cylinders of the<br><br>
engine are arranged, the collective part has an intake gas inlet on one end of the arranging direction, the guide wall is opposed to the intake gas inlet, and the guide wall is disposed at a position opposing one branch intake passage of the branch intake passages , which is most remote from the intake gas inlet. [0009]<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the guide wall has a curved surface with a maximum curvature smaller than a maximum curvature of the corner part. [0010]<br>
Preferably, the branch intake pipes are formed in¬tegrally with the first section, the guide wall lies in an imaginary extension passage on the extension of the branch intake passage, and the corner part of the first section lies outside a region corresponding to the imaginary extension passage.<br>
EFFECTS OF THE INVENTION [0011]<br>
In the intake manifold according to the present invention, the collective part is a split case structure including the first and the second section. Therefore, even if a corner is formed at least in the first section to provide the collective part with a high rigidity, the intake gas can flow smoothly through the intake gas distribution chamber regardless of the shape of the corner owing to the agency of the guide wall of<br><br>
the second section. Since the guide wall extends between the first and the second sections in the intake gas distribution chamber, the intake gas can flow smoothly in a wide region in the intake gas distribution chamber and hence the volumetric efficiency can be improved. [0012]<br>
When the plurality of branch intake passages are arranged in an arranging direction in which cylinders of the engine are arranged, the collective part has an intake gas inlet on one end of the arranging direction, the guide wall is opposed to the intake gas inlet, and the guide wall is disposed at a position opposing one branch intake passage of the branch intake passages , which is most remote from the intake gas inlet, the following advantage is obtained. That is, since the guide wall is opposing both the intake gas inlet and the branch intake passage most remote from the intake gas inlet, the intake gas can be smoothly guided even to the branch intake passage most remote from the intake gas inlet. [0013]<br>
When the guide wall has a curved surface with a maximum curvature smaller than a maximum curvature of the corner part, the intake gas can be guided far smoothly as compared with a case in which the intake gas is guided by the corner part. [0014]<br>
When the branch parts are formed integrally with the<br><br>
first section, the guide wall lies in a region corresponding to the imaginary extension passage on the extension of the branch intake passage, and the corner part of the first section lies outside the region corresponding to the imaginary extension passage, the intake gas flowing into the intake gas distribution chamber can be smoothly guided to the branch intake passages. Further, a mold core for forming the branch intake passages can be removed without being obstructed by the guide wall even though the branch parts defining the branch intake passages are formed integrally with the first section. Therefore, the degree of freedom of design that forms the branch part integrally with the collective part can be increased, the mold is made simple, and hence it is possible to avoid increasing the cost of the intake manifold.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION [0017]<br>
Preferred embodiments of the invention will be described with reference to the drawings. [0018]<br>
Referring to Fig. 1 showing, in an exploded view, an intake manifold M to which the present invention is applied, the intake manifold M is intended to be combined with an inline four-cylinder internal combustion engine, namely, a mul¬tiple-cylinder internal combustion engine for a vehicle. The internal combustion engine has an engine body including a cylinder block integrally provided with a plurality of cylinders (four cylinders in the embodiment shown) in a straight arrangement, a cylinder head joined to the cylinder block, a cylinder head joined to the cylinder block, and a head cover joined to the cylinder head. [0019]<br>
The internal combustion engine is provided with pistons fitted in the cylinders so as to reciprocate in the cylinders, a crankshaft driven for rotation by the pistons driven by the pressure of a combustion gas generated in combustion chambers.<br><br>
and rotatably supported on the cylinder block, an intake system for supplying intake gas into the combustion chambers, an exhaust system for carrying the combustion gas as an exhaust gas from the combustion chambers to the outside of the internal combustion engine. Each of the combustion chambers is defined by the cylinder, the piston fitted in the cylinder, and the cylinder head. [0020]<br>
Referring to Fig. 2, the intake system includes an air cleaner 1 for cleaning intake gas, a throttle device 2 provided with a throttle valve for controlling the flow of intake gas containing air from the air cleaner 1, and the intake manifold M for carrying the intake gas that has passed through the throttle device 2 into the combustion chambers. [0021]<br>
The intake gas that flows through the intake passage in the intake system is sucked through intake ports formed in the cylinder head into the combustion chambers. The intake gas is an air-fuel mixture when fuel is supplied into intake air in the intake system or intake air when fuel is supplied directly into the combustion chambers. [0022]<br>
In this specification, "upstream" and "downstream" are used to indicate directions and positions with respect to the flowing direction of the intake gas.<br><br>
[0023]<br>
Referring to Figs. 1, 2 and 3, the intake manifold M has a collective part 10 defining an intake gas distribution chamber 11 into which the intake gas from the throttle device 2 flows, a branch intake part 2 0 branching out from the collective part 10 and defining branch intake passages 22 for carrying the intake gas into the combustion chambers, and a downstream flange 28, namely, a downstream joining part. [0024]<br>
Downstream intake pipes, not shown, defining downstream branch intake passages to be connected respectively to the branch intake passages 22 are connected to the downstream flange 28.  The downstream intake pipes are connected to the cylinder head. When the internal combustion engine is so designed that the downstream flange 28 can be connected to the cylinder head, the downstream intake pipes may be omitted. [0025]<br>
The collective part 10 has end walls 12 and 13 lon¬gitudinally opposite to each other with respect to the cylinder arranging direction, namely, a horizontal direction in Figs. 2 and 3, a downstream side wall 14 in which the inlets 22i of the branch inlet passages 22 open, an upstream side wall 15 opposite the downstream side wall 14 with respect to a direction in which the branch intake passages 22 extend, a bottom wall 16, namely, a first wall, and a top wall 17, namely, a second<br><br>
10<br>
wall. The intake gas distribution chamber 11 is defined by integrally forming those walls 12 to 17.  The intake gas distribution chamber 11 has an inlet passage lid having an inlet Hi, and an enlarged chamber He. [0026]<br>
An upstream connecting part 18 is formed at one end 10c of the collective part 10 with respect to the cylinder arranging direction. The throttle device 2 has a throttle body defining an intake passage in which the throttle valve is disposed. The upstream connecting part 18 connects to the throttle body. The upstream connecting part 18 defines the inlet passage lid having the inlet Hi. The upstream connecting part 18 is an inlet part of the collective part 10. [0027]<br>
A squarish corner part 31 is formed at the other end lOd of the collective part 10 with respect to the cylinder arranging direction. Squarish corner parts 32 and 33 similar to the corner part 31 are formed continuously with the downstream side wall 14. The corner parts 31 to 33 enhance the rigidity of the collective part 10 to which a negative pressure acts. Each of the corner parts 31 to 33 has typically a slightly curved concave corner surface but may have an angular corner surface without substantial curve. [0028]<br>
The collective part 10 is a split case structure having<br><br>
11<br>
a first section A with a joining surface A2 , and a second section B with a Joining surface B2 . The joining surfaces A2 and B2 are joined air-tightly to complete the collective part 10 . The first section A and the second section B define a first space 11a and a second space lib, respectively. When the first section A and the second section B are joined together, the spaces 11a and IIB form the intake gas distribution chamber 11. The first section A and the second section B are formed individually by molding a synthetic resin in a mold. Edges Al and Bl respectively having the joining surfaces A2 and B2 are joined together by welding, namely, a joining means. [0029]<br>
The first section A has a first end wall 12a, namely, one of parts of the end wall 12, a first end wall 13a, namely, one of parts of the end wall 13, a first downstream side wall 14a, namely, one of parts of the downstream side wall 14, a first upstream wall 15a, namely, one of parts of the upstream side wall 15 , a bottom wall 16 , the branch intake part 20 having the branch intake passages 22, a first corner part 31a, namely, a part of the corner part 31 on the side of the first section A, and the downstream flange 28. Those parts of the first section A are formed integrally. The first end wall 12a, the first end wall 13a, the first downstream side wall 14a, the first upstream side wall 15a, and the bottom wall 16 form a first collective part 10a defining a first chamber 11a.<br><br>
12<br>
[0030]<br>
A semicylindrical first connecting part 18a (Fig. 1), namely, one of parts of the connecting part 18, is formed integrally with the first end wall 12a. The first corner part 31a is formed on the upstream side of the first downstream side wall 14a by parts of the first end wall 13a and the first upstream side wall 15a. The first corner part 31a enhances the rigidity of the first collective part 10a. [0031]<br>
The branch intake part 20 is formed by integrally collecting intake pipes 21 respectively defining the branch intake passages 22. The branch intake passages 22 are tapered to be smaller in cross section toward the downstream side. The branch intake passages 22 are formed by mold cores when the first section A is molded in a mold. After the molding operation, the cores are pulled or removed upstream or removed into the first space 11a, i.e. , into the intake gas distribution chamber 11, along imaginary extension passages 22p parallel to the branch intake passages 22 to pull out the cores from the branch intake passages 22. In Figs. 1 and 2, an imaginary extension passage 22p on the extension of the branch intake passage 22c is indicated by two-dot chain lines. The first corner part 31a, and a first edge part Ala of the edge Al of the upstream side wall 15 are outside an imaginary extension passage section 22pl, which is a part of the imaginary extension<br><br>
13<br>
passage 22p, extending from the inside surface of the first downstream side wall 14a through a distance L2 equal to the length of the branch intake passages 22, whereby the cores can be removed from the branch intake passages 22 without being obstructed by the first section A; that is, the first edge part Ala is outside the region of the imaginary extension passage 22pl. [0032]<br>
As shown in Fig. 2, the length L2 of the branch intake passages 22 is shorter than a distance LI between the inlet 22i, and the first corner part 31a or the first edge part Ala. Thus a space available for removing the core is formed between the downstream side wall 14 and the upstream side wall 15 in the first space 11a of the intake gas distribution chamber 11. [0033]<br>
A bend 31a2 in the first corner part 31a, namely, the bent or curved joint of the first end wall 13a and the first upstream side wall 15a, is not on the imaginary extension passage 22p.  In other words, the bend 31a2 is outside the imaginary extension passage 22p. [0034]<br>
The second section B has a second end wall 12b joined to the first end all 12a to form the end wall 12, a second end wall 13b joined to the second end wall 13a to form the end wall 13, a second downstream side wall 14b joined to the first<br><br>
14<br>
downstream side wall 14a to form the downstream side wall 14, a second upstream side wall 15b joined to the first upstream side wall 15a to form the upstream side wall 15, a top wall 17, a second corner part 31b joined to the first corner part 31a to form the corner part 31, a guide wall 40 for guiding the intake gas so as to flow smoothly in the intake gas distribution chamber 11, a semicylindrical second connecting part 18b joined to the first connecting part 18a to form the connecting part 18.  Those parts of the second section B are formed integrally. The second end wall 12b, the second end wall 13b, the second downstream side wall 14b, the second upstream side wall 15b, and the top wall 17 form a second collective part 10b defining a second chamber lib.  The second corner part 31b enhances the rigidity of the second collective part 10b. [0035]<br>
The guide wall 40 has the shape of a plate curved in the shape of a circular arc and concave toward the intake gas distribution chamber 11. The guide wall 40 is formed in¬tegrally with the second collective part 10b so as to extend between the second end wall 13b and the second upstream side wall 15b. The guide wall 40 covers the inside surface 31bl of the second corner part 31b. As shown in Fig. 1, the guide wall 40 extends along the second end wall 13b and the second upstream side wall 15b and projects beyond the edge Bl to the<br><br>
15<br>
first corner part 31a. [0036]<br>
In the intake manifold M formed by joining together the first section A and the second section B, the guide wall 40 extends in the interior of the second section B or the second space lib and in the interior of the first section A or the first space 11a. The guide wall 40 covers the inside surface 31al of the first corner part 31a. [0037]<br>
The guide wall 40 has connecting parts 41 connected to the second end wall 13b, the second upstream side wall 15b and the top wall 17, and a curved middle part 42 spaced apart from the inside surfaces 31al and 31bl of the corner part 31 toward the central part of the intake gas distribution chamber 11. The connecting part 41 is connected to the second end wall 13b, the second upstream side wall 15b and the top wall 17 in an airtight manner. Since the curved part 42 is spaced apart from the corner part 31, a back space 47 of a volume smaller than that of the intake gas distribution chamber 11 is defined behind the guide wall 40 between the guide wall 40 and the corner part 31. Thus the corner part 31 protrudes to the outside relative to the guide wall 40 on the outer side of the intake gas distribution chamber 11. [0038]<br>
The maximum curvature of a guide surface 44 of the guide<br><br>
16<br>
wall 40, which is a part of the inside surface of the intake gas distribution chamber 11, is smaller than those of the respective inside surfaces 31al and 31bl of the corner parts 31a and 31b. Therefore, the guide surface 44 can guide the intake gas in the intake gas distribution chamber 11 more smoothly than the inside surfaces 31al and 31bl.  Since the guide surface 44 is opposite the inlet Hi and the inlet passage lid with respect to the cylinder arranging direction, the intake gas flowing through the inlet Hi and the inlet passage lid into the enlarged chamber He in the intake gas distribution chamber 11 can easily impinge on the guide surface 44.  Further, since the guide surface 44 of the guide wall 40 is opposed to the inlet 22i of the branch intake passage 22 most remote from the inlet Hi to the chamber 11, the intake gas is smoothly guided to the branch intake passage 22 most remote from the inlet Hi. [0039]<br>
The guide wall 40 is on the imaginary extension passage 22p of the branch intake passage 22c, which is the nearest to the end wall 13a and the corner part 31a among the four branch intake passages 22. In this embodiment, the guide wall 40 extends also in the imaginary extension passage section 22pl as shown in Figs. 1 and 2. Therefore, if the guide wall 40 were formed integrally with the first section A, the guide wall 40 would obstruct pulling out the mold core for forming the<br><br>
17<br>
branch intake passages 22 from within the branch intake passages 22.  The guide wall 40 of the intake manifold M of the present invention does not obstruct removing the core from within the branch intake passages 22. [0040]<br>
The operation and effect of the intake manifold M in the preferred embodiment will be described. [0041]<br>
The collective part 10 of the intake manifold M is formed by joining together the first section A and the second section B respectively defining the first space 11a and the second space lib forming the intake gas distribution chamber 11. The first corner part 31a and the second corner part 31b forming the corner part 31 are formed integrally with the first section A and the second section B, respectively. The guide wall 40 is formed in the second section B so as to extend in the first space 11a and the second space lib and so as to cover the respective inside surfaces 31al and 31bl of the first corner part 31a and the second corner part 31b. The guide wall 40 has the guide surface 4 4 capable of guiding the intake gas more smoothly than the inside surfaces 31a and 31b. The collective part 10 of the intake manifold M is a split case structure formed by joining together the first section A and the second section B. Therefore, the guide wall 40 guides the intake gas so as to flow smoothly in the intake gas distribution chamber 11<br><br>
18<br>
regardless of the shape of the corner part 31 even though the first corner part 31a and the second corner part 31b are formed integrally with the first section A and the second section B, respectively, to enhance the rigidity of the collective part 10. Since the guide wall 40 extends in both the first section A and the second section B, the intake gas can be made to flow smoothly in a wide region in the intake gas distribution chamber 11 and, consequently, the volumetric efficiency can be improved. [0042]<br>
Since the guide wall 40 is formed integrally with only the second section B, the collective part 10 can be easily molded as compared with a case where the guide wall 40 is formed integrally with both the first section A and the second section B [0043]<br>
The branch intake part 20 defining the branch intake passages 22 is formed integrally with the first section A, and the guide wall 40 is on the imaginary extension passage 22p on the extension of the branch intake passage 22c. Thus the intake gas flowing into the intake gas distribution chamber 11 can be smoothly guided into the branch intake passages 22. The guide wall 40 will not obstruct pulling out the core from within the branch intake passages 22 defined by the branch intake part 20 formed integrally with the first section A.<br><br>
19<br>
Therefore, the degree of freedom of design that forms the branch intake part 20 integrally with the collective part 10 can be increased, the mold can be made simple in structure, and hence it is possible to avoid increasing the cost of the intake manifold M. [0044]<br>
Since the guide wall 40 is disposed on the imaginary extension passage part 22pl of the length equal to the length L2 of the branch intake passage 22c, the width of the collective part 10, namely, a dimension in the direction of extension of the imaginary extension passage, can be made small, the size of the collective part 10 in the direction of extension is small, and the intake manifold M can guide the intake gas flowing into the intake gas distribution chamber 11 smoothly into the branch intake passages 22. [0045]<br>
The first corner part 31a, and the first upstream side wall 15a are outside the imaginary extension passage section 22pl, which is a part of the imaginary extension passage 22p, extending from the inside surface of the first downstream side wall 14a through a distance L2 equal to the length of the branch intake passages 22. Therefore, the mold core for forming the branch intake passages 22 can be removed from within the branch intake passages 22 without being obstructed by the guide wall 40, the first corner part 31a and the first upstream side wall<br><br>
20<br>
15a, the degree of freedom of design that forms the branch intake part 20 integrally with the first section A can be increased, and the mold can be made simple in construction. [0046]<br>
Possible changes in the intake manifold M in the preferred embodiment will be described. [0047]<br>
When the first section A and the second section B are formed in proper shapes, respectively, the corner part 31 may be formed only in the first section A. [0048]<br>
The guide wall 40 may have a shape that does not form the back space 47 between the guide wall 40 and the corner part 31. [0049]<br>
The guide wall 40 may be disposed on the imaginary extension passage 22p outside the imaginary extension passage section 22pl. [0050]<br>
The present invention is applicable to multi¬ple-cylinder internal combustion engines other than the four-cylinder internal combustion engine, and is applicable to V-type or flat internal combustion engines having banks each provided with a plurality of cylinders. [0051]<br><br>
21<br>
The predetermined number of branch intake passages does not need necessarily equal to the number of cylinders of the internal combustion engine and may be smaller than the number of the cylinders. [0052]<br>
Although the invention has been described as applied to an internal combustion engine for a vehicle, the present invention is applicable also to marine propulsion devices, such as an outboard motor provided with a vertical crankshaft.<br><br><br>
