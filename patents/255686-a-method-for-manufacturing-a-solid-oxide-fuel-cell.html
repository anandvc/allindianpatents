				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A fuel cell is a device or system that generates electricity by an electrochemical reaction in which oxygen and hydrogen combine to form water. An electrolyte in the cell carries charged particles across a cathode to an anode. Catalysts are often employed to accelerate and improve the efficiency of the electrochemical reaction. Fuel cell devices are a viable spurce of alternative energy. These devices are generally more efficient and produce less pollution than conventional sources of power. The electricity produced by fuel cells can be used to power, for example, aeronautical systems, computer devices, automotive systems and cellular devices.<br>
Typically, fuel cells are classified by the type of electrolyte used. Fuel cell devices also feature different materials depending on an application or specific power requirements. The variety of fuel cells includes, for example, phosphoric acid, proton exchange membrane, molten carbonate, alkaline and solid oxide devices. The solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) provides an environmentally clean and versatile power source that can efficiently convert fossil fuels into electricity and heat.<br>
An SOFC comprises a dense electrolyte that is positioned between porous electrodes, namely, the cathode and anode. The dense electrolyte can be a solid oxygen-ion conductor such as<br>
yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ). Moreover, the cathode and anode can be ceramic composites such as strontium doped lanthanum manganite-YSZ and nickel-YSZ oxide, respectively. SOFC devices can also be assembled into a planar stack in which several cells are arranged with interconnects separating each cell.<br>
An obstacle to commercializing SOFC devices is the substantial cost associated with their manufacture. This cost is an order of magnitude higher than fabricating a comparable gas turbine. One reason for this disparity is that SOFC devices are manufactured by batch processes. Batch processes are used to slowly heat and fire the fuel cell structure to prevent the electrolyte and electrodes from distorting. A standard batch process can uniformly heat and fire an SOFC at a thermal rate of about 1 Â°C per minute. This rate can require several hours to sinter the electrolyte and electrode structures. The process can also require multiple thermal cycles to heat and cool the cell during fabrication. Thus, manufacturing a fuel cell by such processes is entirely inefficient and expensive. With the growing demand for fuel cells, there is a specific need for an efficient fabrication process that is inexpensive and does not require multiple thermal cycles.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a method for conveniently manufacturing a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) at a cost that is less than five-hundred dollars per kilowatt of electricity. The method comprises forming an electrode layer and depositing an electrolyte material on the surface of the electrode. The formed structure is an electrode-electrolyte bi-layer. A second electrode is deposited onto this bi-layer to form a multilayer fuel cell structure comprising an electrolyte positioned between two electrodes. This multilayer structure is then heated and fired in a single thermal cycle to remove any binder materials and<br>
sinter, respectively, the fuel cell. This thermal cycle can be performed in a furnace having one or more chambers. The chamber(s) preferably contains a variable or multiple frequency microwave source for heating the cell and removing binder materials in the electrolyte and electrode structures. The chamber(s) also preferably includes a convection and/or radiation source for sintering the fuel cell.<br>
Additionally, the method of the invention harmonizes and minimizes the deviation among the thermophysical properties of the electrolyte and electrode structures. This harmonization reduces and minimizes the temperature gradient within the cell such that the structure can be uniformly heated and fired during the thermal cycle. The multilayer structure is also unlikely to distort and fracture by minimizing the temperature gradient in the cell. A multilayer fuel cell can also be manufactured by the present method in an order of magnitude less time than standard processes.<br>
The method of the invention can be employed to fabricate an SOFC stack in which several cells are arranged with interconnects separating each cell. The invention also provides a multilayer SOFC structure fabricated according to the disclosed method. These fuel cell devices could be used to power, for example, aeronautical systems, computer devices, automotive systems and cellular devices.<br>
An SOFC manufactured by the disclosed method generally operates in a temperature range from about 700 to 1100 Â°C. The SOFC comprises a dense electrolyte that is positioned between porous electrodes, namely, the cathode and anode. The dense electrolyte can be a solid oxygen-ion conductor such as yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ). Moreover, the cathode and anode can be ceramic composites such as strontium doped lanthanum manganite-YSZ and nickel-YSZ oxide, respectively.<br>
Generally, the method of the invention comprises forming an electrode by controllably distributing phases and particles sizes.<br>
The electrode can be an individual or multiple layer porous structure that is "green" or unfired. The electrode is also dried to have a thickness in the range of about 0.5 to 2.0 mm. A dense electrolyte is then deposited onto the electrode surface as an individual or multiple solid layer having a dried thickness in the range of about 5 to 1000 pn.<br>
A second electrode is deposited on this bi-layer structure. The second electrode can also be an individual or multiple layer porous structure having a dried thickness in the range of about 50 to 150 pm. Each of the above electrolyte and electrode layers are formed according to the invention by suitable deposition techniques such as, for example, screen printing, vacuum infiltration, electrophoretic deposition, ink jet printing, cold pressing, tape casting or spraying. The formed multilayer structure can then be heated and fired in one thermal cycle. This cycle can be performed at a thermal rate of about 10 Â°C per minute.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a method for fabricating a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) in a single thermal cycle. This cycle can be performed as a batch or continuous process. An SOFC can be conveniently manufactured according to the invention at a cost that is less than five-hundred dollars per kilowatt of electricity. The manufactured SOFC also operates in a temperature range from about 700 to 1100 Â°C. Similarly, the method of the invention can fabricate an SOFC stack in which several cells are arranged with interconnects separating each cell. Fuel cell devices manufactured by the disclosed method could be used to power, for example, aeronautical systems, computer devices, automotive systems and cellular devices.<br>
Fuel cells offer an environmentally clean and versatile power source for efficiently converting fossil fuels into<br>
electricity and heat. Figure 1 is a representation of an SOFC 10 comprising a dense electrolyte 12 that is positioned between porous electrodes, namely, the cathode 18 and anode 16. The dense electrolyte can be a solid oxygen-ion conductor such as yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ). In addition, the cathode and anode can be ceramic composites such as strontium doped lanthanum manganite-YSZ and nickel-YSZ oxide, respectively. The fuel cell generates electricity by an electrochemical reaction in which oxygen and hydrogen combine to form water. Specifically, the electrodes reduce oxygen and oxidize hydrogen to yield a voltage 14. The electrodes can also comprises a catalyst such as nickel oxide. This catalyst can accelerate and improve the efficiency of the electrochemical reaction.<br>
Figure 2 is an SOFC stack 20 in which several cells are arranged with interconnects separating each cell. A single fuel cell in the planar stack comprises an electrolyte 25 that is positioned between a cathode 26 and anode 24. The interconnect could be a plate 22 or separator 28 that guides fuel and oxidant flows through the stack. These interconnects are commonly composites such as, for example, lanthanum chromite.<br>
The method of the invention comprises forming an electrode by controllably distributing phases and particles sizes to provide a thermophysically consistent layer having, for example, a uniform microstructure, elasticity and/or a coefficient of thermal expansion. Consistency among these properties prevents the electrode from distorting and fracturing in a thermal cycle. The method also harmonizes and minimizes the deviations among the thermophysical properties of the electrolyte and electrode layers. This harmonization reduces and minimizes the temperature gradient of the cell during the thermal cycle such that the structure can be uniformly heated and fired in an efficient manner.<br>
The electrode is preferably a porous anode such as shown in Figures I and 2. The porous anode can also be an individual or<br>
multiple layer composite such as, for example, nickel-YSZ oxide, nickel-gadolinium oxide doped cerium oxide, nickel-samarium oxide doped cerium oxide, cobalt-YSZ oxide or cobalt-gadolinium oxide doped cerium oxide.<br>
The composite electrode is deposited as a green layer(s) .having a preferable thickness in the range of about 0.5 to 2.0 mm. This electrode thickness acts as a mechanical support for the fuel ceil. The thickness can depend on the tape cast layers preferably used to form the electrode. These layers can also be cast with varying porosities to control gas transport phenomena.<br>
In general, tape cast layers are formed by depositing a powder slurry onto a substrate having a release material. The slurry can comprise binder, dispersant, solvent, plasticizer and composite solids. The binder, for example, can be polyvinyl alcohol or polyvinyl btrtyral. A common solvent could include ethanol, toluene, methanol or isopropanol. The dispersant or dispersing "agent" can include fish oil. These materials are milled and sieved to remove soft agglomerates. A hopper aids the1 flow of powder slurry onto the substrate and a * doctor blade" uniformly distributes the slurry to cast the layer. This layer is then peeled from the substrate and trimmed for the electrode.<br>
The flowchart of Figure 3 shows a tape cast layer provided in step 40. The layer is dried by a suitable technique during step 42 in a temperature range from about 100 to 400 Â°C. This temperature range preferably evaporates materials in the cast layer such as dispersant, solvent and plasticizer to form the porous electrode. The temperature range can also vary depending on the volatility of these materials. The thickness of the electrode can then be measured in step 44 by a convenient technique such as, for example, an optical or scanning electron microscope.<br>
Additional tape cast layers can be deposited onto the electrode in step 45 and dried individually until a thickness in<br>
the preferred range of about 0.5 to 2.0 mm is measured. As described above, these additional layers can be cast with varying porosities to control gas transport phenomena and improve the efficiency of the electrode. It is preferable for the electrodes to be less porous near the electrolyte and increase in porosity through to their exterior surfaces. The formed individual or multiple layer electrode structure of step 46 is then prepared to be processed further according to the invention.<br>
Figure 4 shows a flowchart in which a dense electrolyte is formed on an electrode layer(s) prepared by the method of the invention. This electrolyte can be an individual or multiple layer solid conductor such as shown in Figures 1 and 2. Examples of such solid conductor materials include YSZ, ceria-gadolinium oxide, strontium, magnesium lanthanum gallate or a rare earth metal doped cerium oxide. An YSZ conductor operates efficiently in a temperature range from about 700 to 1100 Â°C, although this range could vary for different electrolyte solids.<br>
The electrolyte layer (s) can be screen printed in step 50 onto the electrode surface as a powder slurry. Screen printing controls the distribution of phases and particle sizes to provide a consistent thermophysical structure. The deposited electrolyte preferably has a thickness in a range of about 5 to 1000 urn. This thickness depends on different printing characteristics such as, for example, the composite solids content or particle distribution in the layer(s) .<br>
The powder slurry for the electrolyte can comprise binder, dispersant, solvent, plasticizer and composite solids. As described above, these materials are milled and sieved to remove soft agglomerates before printing. The screen printed slurry layer is dried during step 52 in a temperature range from about 100 to 400 Â°C. This temperature range preferably evaporates materials in the printed layer to form the dense electrolyte. The<br>
thickness of the electrolyte can then be measured in step 54 by a suitable technique including those previously described.<br>
The electrolyte can be formed by depositing additional screen printed layers in step 56. These layers are each dried until a thickness in the preferred range of about 5 to 1000 jmn is measured. Printing additional layers can be varied to control gas transport phenomena and improve the efficiency of the electrolyte. The formed bi-layer structure of step 60 is then prepared to be processed further according to the invention.<br>
An example of this electrode-electrolyte bi-layer structure is represented in Figures 5 and 6. Figure 5 shows the electrode as a tape cast porous nickel-YSZ oxide anode layer(s). The electrolyte layer(s) is screen printed onto the surface of the anode. This electrolyte is a YSZ solid conductor. Figure 6 is a scanning electron microscope image of this bi-layer structure.<br>
A second electrode is then deposited onto the electrolyte of the bi-layer structure. The flowchart of Figure 7 shows the electrode formed on the surface of the electrolyte layer(s) during step 62. The electrode is formed by controllably distributing phases and particle sizes. The formed electrode is preferably a porous cathode such as shown in Figures 1 and 2. The porous cathode can also be an individual or multiple layer composite such as, for example, as strontium doped lanthanum manganite-YSZ.<br>
The composite electrode can be screen printed as a layer(s) having a preferable thickness in the range of about 50 to 150 urn. This thickness depends on the printed layers used to form the<br>
electrode.  The electrode is deposited as a power slurry that can<br>
i comprise binder, dispersant, solvent, plasticizer and composite<br>
solids. These materials are milled and sieved to remove soft agglomerates before printing. As shown, the deposited slurry layer is dried during step 64 in a temperature range from about<br>
100 to 400 Â°C. This temperature range preferably evaporates materials in the printed layer to form the porous electrode. The<br>
thickness of the electrode can then be measured in step 66 by a suitable technique including those previously described.<br>
The electrode can be formed by printing additional layers onto the electrolyte in step 70 and drying each layer until a thickness in the preferred range of about 50 to 150 (jm is measured. As described above, these additional layers can be deposited with varying porosities to control gas transport phenomena and affect the efficiency of the electrode. This individual or multiple layer electrode structure formed on the electrode-electrolyte bi-layer comprises the multilayer fuel cell structure.<br>
The multilayer structure generally includes a dense electrolyte that is positioned between porous electrodes. Any moisture within the multilayer cell is preferably evaporated by uniformly heating the structure in a temperature range from about 125 to 150 Â°C. The structure can also be heated to remove binder from each of the cell layers in a temperature range from about 275 to 375 Â°C. This temperature range volatizes any plasticizer, dispersant or solvent remaining within each layer. Binder materials that are heated often leave a carbon residue, which can be removed by uniformly heating the structure in a temperature range from about 500 to 600 Â°C. This uniform heating is continued until a temperature of about 800 Â°C in order to decrease the time required for the thermal cycle and improve the process efficiency of the method. The structure is then fired during step 74 in a temperature range from about 1000 to 1500 Â°C to sinter the multilayer structure. The amount of time used to heat and fire the structure across the above temperature ranges can vary depending, for example, on the materials of the cell or a particular process.<br>
The fuel cell structure can be uniformly heated by a variable or multi-frequency microwave source. Such microwave sources are generally described in U.S. Patents Nos. 5,321,222,<br>
5,521,360 and 5,961,871. The frequency and power level of the microwave source can be adjusted to provide efficient coupling of microwave energy to the cell structure. The microwave frequency can also be modulated or swept across a frequency band to provide an intended microwave spectrum. Alternatively, microwave energy could be provided at multiple frequencies. Although a microwave heating source is preferably used to uniformly heat the multilayer structure, other suitable heating processes that minimize the temperature gradient within the cell layers could be used.<br>
A multilayer fuel cell can be fired by convection and/or radiation heating such .as used in a ceramic sintering process. These heating methods could also be carried out in an atmosphere of circulated gas. Temperatures for firing an SOFC can depend on the thennophysical properties of the electrolyte and electrode layers. Thus, different electrical heaters such as, for example, nickel-chromium, molybdenum ribbon, molybdenum-silicate or silicon-carbide can be used for certain cell structures.<br>
The method of the invention heats and fires the multilayer fuel cell in a single thermal cycle. This thermal cycle can be performed in a furnace having one or more chambers. , The chamber(s) preferably contains a variable or multiple frequency microwave source for heating the cell and removing binder materials in the electrolyte and electrode structures. The chamber (s) also preferably includes a convection and/or radiation source for sintering the fuel cell. Such furnaces are described in U.S. Patent Application No. 10/775,542 assigned to BTU International, Incorporated. A single thermal cycle can also be performed as a batch or continuous process.<br>
The electrolyte of the multilayer cell structure is preferably an 8 mole percent YSZ solid conductor and the cathode and anode are strontium doped lanthanum manganite-YSZ and nickel-YSZ oxide ceramic composites, respectively. The electrolyte and electrode layers are also selected to have particle sizes in the<br>
range of nanometers or micrometers. Figure 8 shows an SOFC formed and fired with these materials. The preferred thickness for the dense electrolyte and each porous electrode is also shown.<br>
Process variables of the present invention can also be changed in order to, for example, decrease the time required for the thermal cycle and improve manufacturing efficiency. These variables can include temperature, time, atmosphere, particle size and/or particle distribution. Modifying these variables could also affect and improve interfacial contact and resistance between the layers as well as lower the internal stresses to prevent warping of the multilayer structure. The method of the invention can also be used to process an intermediate temperature SOFC device having, for example, oxygen pumps, sensors or other electrochemical devices.<br>
