				<td>BENZONAPHTHOAZULENES AS INHIBITORS OF TUMOUR NECROSIS FACTOR PRODUCTION AND INTERMEDIATES FOR THE PREPARATION THEREOF<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to benzonaphthoazulene derivatives of tiophene class, to their pharmacologically acceptable salts and solvates, to processes and intermediates for the preparation thereof as well as to their antiinflammatory effects, especially to the inhibition of tumour necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) production and the inhibition of interleukin-1 (IL-1) production as well as to their analgetic action.<br>
Prior Art<br>
Some 1,3-diaza-dibenzoazulene derivatives and salts thereof are well-known as a novel class of compounds having an antiinflammatory action (US 3,711,489, US 4,198,421 and CA 967,573). In the literature, from the class of 1-thia-dibenzoazulenes there are disclosed derivatives substituted in 2-position with methyl, methyl-ketone, nitro group or with carboxylic group derivatives (Cagniant PG, C. R. Hebd. Sceances Acad. Sci., 1976, 253:683-686), and 1 -thia-dibenzoazulene derivatives having alkyloxy substituents in 2-position (WO 01/878990), which also possess a strong antiinflammatory action.<br>
Well-known are also some benzonaphthoazulenes of the thiophene class such as 9,14-dihydro-9,14-dioxo-8-oxa-l-thia-benzo[e]naphtho[3,2-h]azulenes, wherein 3-position is substituted by a cyano group and in 2-position there may be amine, urea or acetamide as a substituent (Nyiondi-Bonguen E et al., /. Chem. Soc, Perkin Trans. /, 1994, 75:2191-2195). However, according to our knowledge and to available literature data, benzonaphthoazulenes of thiophene class of the present invention are not   known.   It   is   also   not   known   that   such   compounds   could   possess   an<br><br>
antiinflammatory action as inhibitors of TNF-a secretion and inhibitors of IL-1 secretion as well as an analgetic action. In 1975 TNF-a was defined as a serum factor induced by endotoxin and causing tumour necrosis in vitro and in vivo (Carswell EA et al., Proc. Natl Acad. Sci U.S.A., 1975, 72:3666-3670). Besides an antitumour action, TNF-a also possesses numerous other biological actions important in the homeostasis of organisms and in pathophysiological conditions. The main sources of TNF-a are monocytes-macrophages, T-lymphocytes and mastocytes.<br>
The discovery that anti-TNF-a antibodies (cA2) have an action in treating patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (Elliott M et ah, Lancet, 1994, 5^:1105-1110) led to an increased interest in finding novel TNF-a inhibitors as possible potent drugs for RA. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune chronic inflammatory disease characterized by irreversible pathological changes in the joints. Besides in RA, TNF-a antagonists may also be used in numerous pathological conditions and diseases such as spondylitis, osteoarthritis, gout and other arthritic conditions, sepsis, septic shock, toxic shock syndrom, atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, psoriasis, glomerulonephritis, lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, asthma, cachexia, chronic obstructive lung disease, congestive cardiac arrest, insulin resistance, lung fibrosis, multiple sclerosis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, viral infections and AIDS.<br>
Evidence for the biological importance of TNF-a was obtained by in vivo experiments in mice, in which mice gens for TNF-a or its receptor were inactivated. Such animals are resistant to collagen-induced arthritis (Mori L et al., J. Immunol., 1996, 757:3178-3182) and to endotoxin-caused shock (Pfeffer K et al., Cell 1993, 75:457-467). In animal assays where TNF-a level was increased, a chronic inflammatory polyarthritis occured (Georgopoulos S et al., J.Inflamm., 1996, 45:86-97; Keffer J et al., EMBO /., 1991, 70:4025-4031) and its pathological picture was alleviated by inhibitors of TNF-a production. The treatment of such inflammatory and pathological conditions usually includes the application of non-steroid antiinflammatory drugs and, in more severe<br><br>
cases, gold salts, D-penicillinamine or methotrexate are administered. Said drugs act symptomatically, but they do not stop the pathological process. Novel approaches in the therapy of rheumatoid arthritis are based upon drugs such as tenidap, leflunomide, cyclosporin, FK-506 and upon biomolecules neutralizing the TNF-a action. At present there are commercially available etanercept (Enbrel, Immunex/Wyeth), a fusion protein of the soluble TNF-a receptor, and infliximab (Remicade, Centocor), a chimeric monoclonal human and mouse antibody. Besides in RA therapy, etanercept and infliximab are also registered for the therapy of Crohn's disease (Exp. Opin. Invest. Drugs, 2000, 9:103).<br>
In RA therapy, besides inhibition of TNF-a secretion, also the inhibition of IL-1 secretion is very important since IL-1 is an important cytokin in cell regulation and immunoregulation as well as in pathophysiological conditions such as inflammation (Dinarello CA et al., Rev. Infect. Disease, 1984, 5:51). Well-known biological activities of IL-1 are: activation of T-cells, induction of elevated temperature, stimulation of secretion of prostaglandine or collagenase, chemotaxia of neutrophils and reduction of iron level in plasma (Dinarello CA, J. Clinical Immunology, 1985, 5:287). Two receptors to which IL-1 may bind are well-known: IL-1RI and IL-1RII. Whereas IL-1RI transfers a signal intracellularly, IL-1RII is situated on the cell surface and does not transfer a signal inside the cell. Since IL1-RII binds IL-1 as well as ILl-RI, it may act as a negative regulator of IL-1 action. Besides this mechanism of signal transfer regulation, another natural antagonist of IL-1 receptor (IL-lra) is present in cells. This protein binds to IL-1RI but does not transfer any signal. However, its potency in stopping the signal transfer is not high and its concentration has to be 500 times higher than that of IL-1 in order to achieve a break in the signal transfer. Recombinant human IL-lra (Amgen) was clinically tested (Bresnihan B et al., Arthrit. Rheum., 1996, 39:73) and the obtained results indicated an improvement of the clinical picture in 472 RA patients over an placebo. These results indicate the importance of the inhibition of IL-1 action in treating diseases such as RA where IL-1 production is disturbed. Since there exists a synergistic action of TNF-a and IL-1,<br><br>
benzonaphthoazulenes may be used in treating conditions and diseases related to an enhanced secretion of TNF-a and IL-1.<br>

a reaction of the compounds of the formula Va<br><br>
wherein L has a meaning of a leaving group, with compounds of the formula IVa<br><br>

Preparation methods:<br>
a) Cyclization of the compounds of the formula III with ethyl mercaptoacetate is carried out by methods disclosed for the preparation of analogous compounds. The reaction is carried out in the presence of organic bases (preferably pyridine) at the boiling point during 1 to 5 hours. The obtained tetracyclic products may be isolated by column chromatography or by recrystallization from an appropriate solvent.<br>
The starting substances for the preparation of the compounds of the formula III, ketones of the formula VI,<br><br><br>
F<br>
are already known or are prepared by methods disclosed for the preparation of analogous compounds. Thus e.g. the compounds of the formula VI may be obtained starting from compounds of the formula VIII<br><br>
wherein R5 has a meaning of a C02H group, in such a way that by suitable chemical transformations there is obtained a compound of the formula VIII wherein R5 has the meaning of CH2CO2H. By the action of polyphosphoric acid, cyclization and formation of a ketone of the formula VI occur. A similar reaction sequence has been disclosed earlier in Protiva M et al. (CS 163583, Collect. Czech. Chem. Commun., 1975, 40:1960-1965 and Collect Czech. Chem. Commun., 1974, 59:3147-3152). Alternatively, the compound of the formula VIII, wherein R5 has the meaning of CH2CO2H, may be prepared by reacting the compound of the formula VIII, wherein R5 is COCH3, with sulfur and morpholine and by hydrolyzing thioamide thus obtained (Ueda I et al., Chem. Pharm. Bull, 1975* 23:2223-2231). By the action of Vilsmeier-Haack reagent upon the corresponding ketones of the formula VI, compounds of the formula III (Tsuji K et al., Chem. Pharm. Bull, 1998, 46:279-286) are prepared.<br>
b) Compounds of the formula I according to the present process may be prepared by reaction of alcohols of the formula V and compounds of the formula IV, wherein R4 has the meaning of a leaving group, which may be a halogen atom (most frequently bromine,     iodine     or     chlorine)     or     sulfonyloxy     group     (most     frequently<br><br>
trifluoromethylsulfonyloxy or p-toluenesulfonyloxy). The reaction of condensation may be carried out according to methods disclosed for the preparation of analogous compounds (Menozzi G et al., J. Heterocyclic Chern., 1997, 34:963-968 or WO 01/87890). The reaction is carried out at a temperature from 20°C to 100°C during 1 to 24 hours in a two-phase system (preferably with 50% NaOH/toluene) in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst (preferably benzyl triethyl ammonium chloride, benzyl triethyl ammonium bromide, cetyl trimethyl bromide). After treating the reaction mixture, the products formed are isolated by recrystallization or chromatography on a silica gel column.<br>
The starting substances, alcohols of the formula V, may be prepared from the compounds of the formula I, wherein R1 has the meaning of a suitable functional group. Thus e.g. alcohols of the formula V may be obtained by the reduction of alkyloxycarbonyl group (e.g. ethyloxycarbonyl) by using metal hydrides such as lithium aluminum hydride or sodium borohydride. Further, alcohols of the formula V may be prepared by hydrolysis of the corresponding esters in an alkaline or acidic medium.<br>
The starting compounds of the formula IV are already known or are prepared according to methods disclosed for the preparation of analogous compounds.<br>
c) Compounds of the formula I according to the present process may be prepared by reacting compounds of the formula Va, wherein L has the meaning of a leaving group defined earlier for R4, and compounds of the formula IVa, wherein Qi has the meaning of oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur or -OC-. The most suitable condensation reactions are reactions of nucleophilic substitution on a saturated carbon atom as disclosed in the literature.<br>
The starting compounds of the formula Va (most frequently halides) may be obtained by halogenation (e.g. bromination or chlorination) of alcohols of the formula V with<br><br>
the usual halogenating agents (e.g. hydrobromic acid, PBr3, SOCl^ or PC15) by processes as disclosed in the literature. The obtained compounds may be isolated or may be used without isolation as suitable intermediates for the preparation of the compounds of the formula I.<br>
The starting compounds of the formula IVa are already known or are prepared according to methods disclosed for the preparation of analogous compounds.<br>
d)	The compounds of the formula I, wherein Qi has a meaning of -0-, -NH- or -S-, may be prepared by condensation of the compounds of the formula Vb and of compounds of the formula IV, wherein R has the meaning of a leaving group defined earlier. The reaction may be carried out at reaction conditions disclosed in method b) or by reactions of nucleophilic substitution disclosed in the literature. The starting alcohols, amines and thiols may be obtained by a reaction of water, ammonia or hydrogen sulfide with compounds Va according to processes disclosed in the literature.<br>
e)	The alcohols of the structure V may be oxidized to corresponding compounds of the formula Vb, wherein Qi has the meaning of carbonyl and which may further, by reaction with corresponding ylide reagents, result in a prolongation of the chain and in the formation of an alkenyl substituent with carbonyl or ester groups as disclosed in HR patent application No. 20000310.<br>
Besides the reactions mentioned above, the compounds of the formula I may be prepared by transforming other compounds of the formula I and it is to be understood that the present invention also comprises such compounds and processes. A special example of a change of a functional group is the reaction of the aldehyde group with chosen phosphorous ylides resulting in a prolongation of the chain and the formation of an alkenyl substituent with carbonyl or ester groups as disclosed in HR patent application No.  20000310. These reactions  are  carried  out in  solvents  such  as<br><br>
benzene, toluene or hexane at elevated temperature (most frequently at boiling temperature).<br>
By reacting the compounds of the formula Va with 1-alkyne in an alkaline medium (such as sodium amide in ammonia) the compounds of the formula I, wherein Q] is -C=C-, are obtained. The reaction conditions of this process are disclosed in the literature. At similar reaction conditions (nucleophilic substitution) various ether, thioether or amine derivatives may be prepared.<br>
The formylation of the compounds of the formula I by processes such as e.g. Vilsmeier acylation or reaction of /i-BuLi and Af N-dimethylformamide is a further general example of a transformation. The reaction conditions of these processes are well-known in the literature.<br>
By hydrolysis of the compounds of the formula I having nitrite, amide or ester groups, there may be prepared compounds with a carboxyl group, which are suitable intermediates for the preparation of other compounds with novel functional groups such as e.g. esters, amides, halides, anhydrides, alcohols or amines.<br>
Oxidation or reduction reactions are a further possibility of the change of substituents in the compounds of the formula I. Most frequently used oxidation agents are peroxides (hydrogen peroxide, /n-chloroperbenzoic acid or benzoyl peroxide) or permanganate, chromate or perchlorate ions. Thus e.g. by the oxidation of an alcohol group by pyridinyl dichromate or pyridinyl chlorochromate, an aldehyde group is formed, which group may be converted to a carboxyl group by further oxidation. By oxidation of the compounds of the formula I, wherein R1 has the meaning of alkyl, with lead tetraacetate in acetic acid or with 7V-bromosuccinimide using a catalytic amount of benzoyl peroxide, a corresponding carbonyl derivative is obtained.<br><br>
By a selective oxidation of alkylthio group, alkylsulfinyl or alkylsulfonyl groups may be prepared.<br>
By the reduction of the compounds with a nitro group, the preparation of amino compounds is made possible. The reaction is carried out under usual conditions of catalytic hydrogenation or electrochemically. By catalytic hydrogenation using palladium on carbon, alkenyl substituents may be converted to alkyl ones or nitrile group can be converted to aminoalkyl.<br>
Various substituents of the aromatic structure in the compounds of the formula I may be introduced by standard substituion reactions or by usual changes of individual functional groups. Examples of such reactions are aromatic substitutions, alkylations, halogenation, hydroxylation as well as oxidation or reduction of substituents. Reagents and reaction conditions are known from the literature. Thus e.g. by aromatic substitution a nitro group is introduced in the presence of concentrated nitric acid and sulfuric acid. By using acyl halides or alkyl halides, the introduction of an acyl group or an alkyl group is made possible. The reaction is carried out in the presence of Lewis acids such as aluminum- or iron-trichloride in conditions of Friedel-Crafts reaction. By the reduction of the nitro group, an amino group is obtained, which is by the reaction of diazotizing converted to a suitable starting group, which may be replaced with one of the following groups: H, CN, OH, Hal.<br>
In order to prevent undesired interaction in chemical reactions, it is often necessary to protect certain groups such as e.g. hydroxy, amino, thio or carboxy. For this purpose a great number of protecting groups may be used (Green TW, Wuts PGH, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley and Sons, 1999) and the choice, use and elimination thereof are conventional methods in chemical synthesis.<br>
A convenient protection for amino or alkylamino groups are groups such as e..g. alkanoyl   (acetyl),   alkoxycarbonyl   (methoxycarbonyl,   ethoxycarbonyl   or   tert-<br><br>
butoxycarbonyl); arylmethoxycarbonyl (benzyloxycarbonyl), aroyl (benzoyl) or alkylsilyl (trimethylsilyl or trimethylsilylethoxymethyl) groups. The conditions of removing a protecting group depend upon the choice and the characteristics of this group. Thus e.g. acyl groups such as alkanoyl, alkoxycarbonyl or aroyl may be eliminated by hydrolysis in the presence of a base (sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide), /ert-butoxycarbonyl or alkylsilyl (trimethylsilyl) may be eliminated by treatment with a suitable acid (hydrochloric, sulfuric, phosphoric or trifluoroacetic acid), whereas arylmethoxycarbonyl group (benzyloxycarbonyl) may be eliminated by hydrogenation using a catalyst such as palladium on carbon.<br>
Salts of the compounds of the formula I may be prepared by generally known processes such as e.g. by reacting the compounds of the formula I with a corresponding base or acid in an appropriate solvent or solvent mixture e.g. ethers (diethylether) or alcohols (ethanol, propanol or isopropanol).<br>
Another object of the present invention concerns the use of the present compounds in the therapy of inflammatory diseases and conditions, especially all diseases and conditions induced by excessive TNF-a and IL-1 secretion.<br>

Solid carriers may be lactose, sucrose, talcum, gelatine, agar, pectin, magnesium stearate, fatty acids etc. Liquid carriers may be syrups, oils such as olive oil, sunflower oil or soya bean oil, water etc. Similarly, the carrier may also contain a component for a sustained release of the active component such as e.g. glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate. Various forms of pharmaceutical formulations may be used. Thus, if a solid carrier is used, these forms may be tablets, hard gelatine capsules, powder or granules, which may be administered in capsules per os. The amount of the solid carrier may vary, but it is mainly from 25 mg to 1 g. If a liquid carrier is used, the formulation would be in the form of a syrup, emulsion, soft gelatine capsules, sterile injectable liquids such as ampoules or non-aqueous liquid suspensions.<br>
Compounds according to the present invention may be applied per os, parenterally, locally, intranasally, intrarectally and intravaginally. The parenteral route herein means intravenous, intramuscular and subcutaneous applications. Appropriate formulations of the present compounds may be used in the prophylaxis as well as in the treatment of various diseases and pathological inflammatory conditions induced by an excessive unregulated production of cytokins or inflammation mediators, primarily TNF-a. They comprise rheumatoid arthritis, rheumatoid spondylitis, osteoarthritis and other arthritic pathological conditions and diseases, eczemas, psoriasis and other inflammatory skin conditions such as bums induced by UV radiation (sun rays and similar UV sources), inflammatory eye diseases, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and asthma.<br><br>
The inhibitory action of the present compounds upon TNF-a and IL-1 secretion was determined by the following in vitro and in vivo experiments:<br>
Determination   of TNF-a  and   IL-1   secretion   in   human   peripheral   blood mononuclear cells in vitro<br>
Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were prepared from heparinized whole blood after separating PBMC on Ficoll-Paque Plus (Amersham-Pharmacia). To determine the TNF-a level, 3.5-5xl04 cells were cultivated in a total volume of 200 pi for 18 to 24 hours on microtitre plates with a flat bottom (96 wells, Falcon) in RPMI 1640 medium, into which there were added 10% FBS (Fetal Bovine Serum, Biowhittaker) previously inactivated at 54°C/30 min, 100 units/ml of penicillin, 100 mg/ml of streptomycin and 20 mM HEPES (GIBCO). The cells were incubated at 37°C in an atmosphere with 5% C02 and 90% humidity. In a negative control the cells were cultivated only in the medium (NC), whereas in a positive control TNF-a secretion was triggered by adding 1 ng/ml of lipopolysaccharides (LPS, E. coli serotype 0111:B4, SIGMA) (PC). The effect of the tested substances upon TNF-a secretion was investigated after adding them into cultures of cells stimulated by LPS (TS). The TNF-a level in the-cell supernatant was determined by ELISA procedure according to the suggestions of the producer (R&amp;D Systems). The test sensitivity was 
The IC-50 value was defined as the substance concentration, at which 50% of TNF-a production were inhibited.<br><br>
Compounds showing IC-50 with 20 μM or lower concentrations are active.<br>
Determination of TNF-a and IL-1 secretion in mouse peritoneal macrophages in vitro<br>
In order to obtain peritoneal macrophages, Balb/C mouse strain males, age 8 to 12 weeks, were injected i.p. with 300 μg of zymosan (SIGMA) dissolved in a phosphate buffer (PBS) in a total volume of 0.1 ml/mouse. After 24 hours the mice were euthanized according to the Laboratory Animal Welfare Act. The peritoneal cavity was washed with a sterile physiological solution (5 ml). The obtained peritoneal macrophages were washed twice with a sterile physiological solution and, after the last centrifiigation (350 g/10 min), resuspended in RPMI 1640, into which 10% of FBS portion were added. In order to determine TNF-a secretion, 5x10 cells/well were cultivated in a total volume of 200 μl for 18 to 24 hours on microtitre plates with a flat bottom (96 wells, Falcon) in RPMI 1640 medium, into which 10% FBS (Fetal Bovine Serum, Biowhittaker) inactivated by heat, 100 units/ml of penicillin, 100 mg/ml of streptomycin, 20 mM HEPES and 50 μM 2-mercaptoethanol (all of GIBCO) were added. The cells were incubated at 37°C in an atmosphere with 5% CO2 and 90% humidity. In a negative control the cells were cultivated only in a medium (NC), whereas in a positive control the TNF-a secretion was triggered by adding 10 ng/ml of lipopolysaccharides (LPS, E. coli serotype 0111:B4, SIGMA) (PC). The effect of the substances upon the TNF-a secretion was investigated after adding them into cultures of cells stimulated with LPS (TS). The TNF-a level in the cell supernatant was determined by ELISA procedure (R&amp;D Systems, Biosource). The IL-1 level was determined in an assay identical to the assay for TNF-a by ELISA procedure (R&amp;D Systems). The percentage of inhibition of TNF-a or IL-1 production was calculated by the equation: % inhibition - [1- (TS-NC)/(PC-NC)] 100.<br><br>
The IC-50 value was defined as the substance concentration, at which 50% of TNF-a production were inhibited.<br>
Compounds showing IC-50 with 10 jiM or lower concentrations are active.<br>
In vivo model of LPS-induced excessive TNF-a or IL-1 secretion in mice<br>
TNF-a or IL-1 secretion in mice was induced according to the already disclosed method (Badger AM et al., J. Pharmac. Env. Therap., 1996, 279:1453-1461). Balb/C males, age 8 to 12 weeks, in groups of 6 to 10 animals were used. The animals were treated p.o. either with a solvent only (in negative and in positive controls) or with solutions of substances 30 minutes prior to i.p. treatment with LPS (£. coli serotype 0111:B4, Sigma) in a dosis of 25 fig/animal. Two hours later the animals were euthanized by means of i.p. Roumpun (Bayer) and Ketanest (Parke-Davis) injection. A blood sample of each animal was taken into a Vacutainer tube (Becton Dickinson) and the plasma was separated according to the producers instructions. The TNF-a level in the plasma was determined by ELISA procedure (Biosource, R&amp;D Systems) according to the producer's instructions. The test sensitivity was 
Active are the compounds showing 30% or more inhibition of TNF-a production at a dosis of 10 mg/kg.<br>
Writhing assay for analgetic activity<br>
In this assay pain is induced by the injection of an irritant, most frequently acetic acid, into the peritoneal cavity of mice. Animals react with characteristic writhings, which has given the name of the assay (Collier HOJ et al, Pharmac. Chemother., 1968,<br><br>
52:295-310; Fukawa K et al., J. Pharmacol Meth ., 1980, 4:251-259; Schweizer A et al., Agents Actions, 1988, 25:29-31). The assay is convenient for the determination of analgetic activity of compounds. Procedure: male Balb/C mice (Charles River, Italy), age 8 to 12 weeks, were used. A control group received methyl cellulose p.o. 30 minutes prior to i.p. application of acetic acid in a concentration of 0.6%, whereas test groups received standard (acetylsalicylic acid) or test substances in methyl cellulose p.o. 30 minutes prior to i.p. application of 0.6% acetic acid (volume 0.1 ml/10 g). The mice were placed individually under glass funnels and the number of writhings was registered for 20 minutes for each animal. The percentage of writhing inhibition was calculated according to the equation:<br>
% inhibition = (mean value of number of writhings in the control group - number of writhings in the test group)/number of writhings in the control group * 100.<br>
Active are the compounds showing such analgetic activity as acetylsalicylic acid or better.<br>
In vivo model of LPS-induced shock in mice<br>
Male Balb/C mice (Charles River, Italy), age 8 to 12 weks, were used. LPS isolated from Serratie marcessans (Sigma, L-6136) was diluted in sterile physiological solution. The first LPS injection was administered intradermally in a dosis of 4 jig/mouse. 18 to 24 hours later, LPS was administered i.v. in a dosis of 200 jxg/mouse. A control group received two LPS injections as disclosed above. The test groups received substances p.o. half an hour prior to each LPS application. Survival after 24 hours was observed.<br>
Active are the substances at which the survival at a dosis of 30 mg/kg was 40% or more.<br><br>
