Invention Title<br>
HIGHLY PURE AMPHIPHILIC COPOLYMER COMPRISING<br>
HYDROPHOBIC BLOCK FROM ALPHA-HYDROXY ACID AND PROCESS<br>
FOR THE PREPARATION THEREOF<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a highly pure amphiphilic block copolymer<br>
including a hydrophobic polymer block of a poly(a-hydroxy acid), and a method for<br>
preparing the same.<br>
Background Art<br>
An amphiphilic block copolymer includes a hydrophilic polymer block and a<br>
hydrophobic polymer block. Since the hydrophilic polymer block is in direct contact<br>
with blood proteins and cell membranes in vivo, a biocompatible polymer such as<br>
polyethylene glycol or monomethoxypolyethylene glycol has been used as the<br>
hydrophilic polymer block. Meanwhile, the hydrophobic polymer block improves<br>
affinity to hydrophobic drugs, and particular examples thereof that have been used to<br>
date include biodegradable polymers such as polylactide, polyglycolide, poly(lactic-co-<br>
glycolide), polycaprolactone, polyaminoacids or polyorthoesters. Particularly,<br>
polylactide derivatives have been applied to drug carriers in various forms, because they<br>
have excellent biocompatibility and are hydrolyzed into non-harmful lactic acid in vivo.<br>
Polylactide derivatives have various physical properties depending on their molecular<br>
weights. In addition, polylactide derivatives have been developed as various forms<br>
including microspheres, nanoparticles, polymeric gels and implant agents.<br>
When an amphiphilic block copolymer is used as a drug carrier, drug release<br>
rates are controlled by modifying the composition of the hydrophilic polymer block and<br>
the hydrophobic polymer block, the molecular weight of each block, etc. In controlling<br>
drug release rates precisely, purity of the amphiphilic block copolymer is important.<br>
Monomers are used to prepare the hydrophobic biodegradable polymer block.<br>
However, unreacted monomers contained in the final amphiphilic block copolymer may<br>
result in a broad molecular weight distribution. When a low molecular weight polymer<br>
is administered to the human body, excessive drug release may occur at the early stage.<br>
In addition, any residual monomer may be decomposed to reduce pH so that the<br>
polymer is decomposed rapidly, which leads to a failure in continued drug release.<br>
Under these circumstances, there has been suggested a method for purifying an<br>
amphiphilic block copolymer containing a polylactide derivative as a hydrophobic<br>
block by a solvent/non-solvent process. In the method, a methylene chloride/ether<br>
system is used as the solvent/non-solvent system to remove monomers, D,L-lactide.<br>
Although the method is effective for removing D,L-lactide, stannous octoate used as a<br>
catalyst for the polymerization co-precipitates with the block copolymer in the non-<br>
solvent, and thus is hardly removed from the block copolymer. Additionally, due to<br>
very low boiling points of ethers used as the non-solvent, the method is not suitable for<br>
commercialization. The catalyst, stannous octoate, still remaining after the solvent/non-<br>
solvent purification, may accelerate hydrolysis of polylactide derivatives, resulting in a<br>
decrease in the molecular weight of the block copolymer, and thus a decrease in pH.<br>
As another approach, there has been suggested a method for removing<br>
monomers without using any solvent. In the method, after an amphiphilic copolymer<br>
containing a polylactide derivative is prepared, unreacted lactide monomers are<br>
removed under a high-temperature vacuum condition via sublimation based on the<br>
sublimation property of lactide. The method is favorable to commercialization.<br>
However, the method has difficulty in reducing the content of residual monomers to 1<br>
wt% or less. In addition, such long-period high-temperature vacuum conditions<br>
interrupt control of a desired molecular weight due to the pyrolysis of the resultant<br>
polymer. Further, an organometal catalyst used for the polymerization still remains<br>
after carrying out the method.<br>
Meanwhile, US Patent Publication No. 2005-0238168 discloses a method for<br>
purifying low molecular weight D,L.-polylactic acid via liquid/liquid phase separation. A<br>
phase separation phenomenon occurs when the polymer obtained after polymerization is<br>
heated and dissolved in methanol or ethanol, and then refrigerated and stored at -78 °C.<br>
Low-molecular weight polylactic acid is dissolved in the upper organic solvent layer,<br>
while high-molecular weight polylactic acid is solidified in the lower layer. The lower<br>
layer is separated and the solvent of the lower layer is removed via distillation to<br>
remove monomers and oligomers. It is described that the method provides highly pure<br>
D,L-polylactic acid having a narrow molecular weight distribution. However, since the<br>
low-temperature refrigeration causes a drop in the solubility of unreacted lactide<br>
monomers and precipitation of the unreacted monomers, it is difficult to remove the<br>
unreacted monomers. Moreover, amphiphilic block copolymers are not liquid/liquid<br>
phase separable even under low-temperature refrigeration. Therefore, the method is not<br>
suitable for the purification of amphiphilic block copolymers.<br>

less based on the total weight of the copolymer.<br>
The highly pure amphiphilic block copolymer including a hydrophobic polymer<br>
block of a poly(a-hydroxy acid) and preparation thereof are described in more detail<br>
hereinafter.<br>
According to one embodiment, there is provided a method for preparing a<br>
highly pure amphiphilic block copolymer including a hydrophobic polymer block of a<br>
poly(a-hydroxy acid). The method includes hydrolyzing monomers to increase the<br>
solubility of the monomers to an aqueous solution, and adopting a salting-out technique<br>
using a salt compound to perform liquid/liquid phase separation.<br>
More particularly, the method according to one embodiment includes:<br>
- dissolving an amphiphilic block copolymer including a hydrophobic polymer<br>
block of a poly(a-hydroxy acid) into a water-miscible organic solvent;<br>
- mixing a resultant polymer solution with water or an aqueous solution<br>

- separating a resultant solution into an organic solvent layer and an aqueous<br>
layer via salting out; and<br>
- collecting the organic solvent layer and removing the organic solvent<br>
therefrom to recover a polymer.<br>
The amphiphilic block copolymer obtained from the method according to one<br>
embodiment includes an A-B type diblock copolymer or a B-A-B type triblock<br>
copolymer consisting of a hydrophilic block (A) and a hydrophobic block (B). The<br>
amphiphilic block copolymer has a hydrophilic block content of 20 wt%-95 wt%, more<br>
particularly 40 wt%-95 wt%, and a hydrophobic block content of 5 wt%-80 wt%, more<br>
particularly 5 wt%-60 wt%. The amphiphilic block copolymer may have a number<br>
average molecular weight of 1.000 Daltons to 50,000 Daltons, more particularly 1,500<br>
Daltons to 20,000 Daltons.<br>
The hydrophilic polymer block includes a biocompatible polymer such as<br>
polyethylene glycol or a derivative thereof, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyvinyl alcohol or<br>
polyacrylamide. More particularly, the hydrophilic polymer block includes<br>
polyethylene glycol or monomethoxypolyethylene glycol. The hydrophilic block may<br>
have a number average molecular weight of 200 Daltons to 20,000 Daltons, specifically<br>
200 Daltons to 10,000 Daltons.<br>
The hydrophobic polymer block includes a biodegradable polymer such as a<br>
polymer of monomers derived from a-hydroxy acid. The hydrophobic polymer block<br>
may include at least one polymer selected from the group consisting of polylactide,<br>
polyglycolide, poly(mandelic acid), polycaprolactone or poly(dioxan-2-one),<br>
copolymers thereof, polyaminoacids, polyorthoesters, polyanhydrides and<br>
polycarbonates. More particularly, the hydrophobic polymer block includes polylactide,<br>
polyglycolide, polycaprolactone or poly(dioxan-2-one).<br>
The amphiphilic block copolymer including a hydrophobic polymer block of a<br>
poly(a-hydroxy acid) may be represented by the following Formula 1:<br>
[Formula 1]<br>
HO-[R1]l-[R2]m-[R3]n-R4<br>
wherein<br>
R1 is -CHZ-C(=O)-O-;<br>
R2 is -CHY-C(=O)-O-, -CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2-C(=O)-O- or<br>
-CH2CH2OCH2-C(=O)-O-;<br>
R3 is -CH2CH2O-, -CH(OH)-CH2-, -CH(C(=O)-NH2)-CH2- or<br><br>
R4 is -CH3 or -C(=O)-[R1]l-[R2]m-CHZ-OH;<br>
each of Z and Y is -H, -CH3, -C6H5 or C6H5-CH2-;<br>
each of l and m is an integer of 0-300, with the proviso that both 1 and m are not<br>
0 at the same time; and<br>
n is an integer of 4-1,100.<br>
First, in the method according to one example embodiment, an amphiphilic<br>
block copolymer including a hydrophobic polymer block of a poly(a-hydroxy acid) is<br>
dissolved into a water-miscible organic solvent. The water-miscible solvent is a solvent<br>
capable of solubilizing the amphiphilic block copolymer and has a boiling point of 100<br>
°C or lower. Particular examples of the water-miscible solvent include acetone or<br>
acetonitrile. The organic solvent may be used in an amount corresponding to 0.5-5<br>
times, more particularly 0.5-2 times of the weight of the amphiphilic block copolymer.<br>
Next, water or an aqueous solution containing an alkali metal salt is gradually<br>
added to and mixed with the organic solvent containing the polymer dissolved therein.<br>
By doing so, low molecular weight polylactide derivatives and lactone monomers are<br>
hydrolyzed, and then are subjected to neutralization with the alkali metal salt, thereby<br>
forming a salt compound. On the contrary, since the poly(a-hydroxy acid) contained<br>
in the amphiphilic block copolymer has a terminal hydroxyl group, it does not react<br>
with the alkali metal salt. Particular examples of the aqueous solution containing an<br>
alkali metal salt that may be used include aqueous solutions of sodium bicarbonate,<br>
sodium carbonate, potassium bicarbonate, potassium carbonate or lithium carbonate.<br>
More particularly, the aqueous solution containing an alkali metal salt may be an<br>
aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution. The aqueous solution may have a concentration<br>
of 0.05 g/mL to 0.2 g/mL, more particularly about 0.1 g/mL. Addition amount of<br>
water or an aqueous solution containing an alkali metal salt may depend on the content<br>
of unreacted monomers and the amount of the organic solvent. Particularly, water or<br>
the aqueous alkali metal solution may be added in an amount corresponding to 0.5-5<br>
times, specifically 0.5-2 times of the volume of the organic solvent. Herein, a resultant<br>
mixed solution may be heated at 25-100 °C for 10 minutes to 24 hours, more<br>
particularly, at 60-80 °C for 2 to 6 hours to carry out a reaction. If the mixed solution<br>
is heated to a higher temperature than the above range, the resultant amphiphilic block<br>
copolymer may be hydrolyzed at the site of its hydrophobic block, resulting in a<br>
decrease in the molecular weight of the copolymer.<br>
Then, the mixed solution is separated into the water-miscible organic solvent<br>
layer and the aqueous layer by adding another salt compound thereto, because the salt<br>
compound formed by the preceding operation has a high solubility to an aqueous<br>
solution. Particular examples of the salt compound that may be used herein include<br>
sodium chloride or potassium chloride. The salt compound may be added in an<br>
amount of 0.1 -50 wt%, more particularly 0.1 -20 wt% based on the total weight of the<br>
amphiphilic block copolymer. Thus, the organic solvent layer includes a purified<br>
amphiphilic block copolymer dissolved therein, while the aqueous layer includes the<br>
salt compound, the alkali metal salt, metal salts of the neutralized monomers and the<br>
organometal catalyst.<br>
Finally, the organic solvent layer separated as described above is collected, and<br>
the organic solvent is removed therefrom to recover the purified polymer. The organic<br>
solvent may be removed via a known fractional distillation process or a (solvent/non-<br>
solvent) precipitation process. More particularly, fractional distillation may be used to<br>
remove the organic solvent, for example, at a temperature of 60-80 °C.<br>
According to another example embodiment, to remove the salt compound and<br>
the alkali metal salt present in the finally formed polymer in a small amount, the<br>
method may further include:<br>
- dissolving the polymer recovered after removing the organic solvent into an<br>
anhydrous organic solvent, followed by filtering, to obtain a solution containing the<br>
polymer; and<br>
- removing the organic solvent from the solution containing the polymer.<br>
Particularly, addition of the anhydrous organic solvent to the polymer allows<br>
the amphiphilic block copolymer to be dissolved in the organic solvent and causes<br>
precipitation of the salt compound and the alkali metal salt present in the polymer in a<br>
small amount. Thus, the precipitated salt compound and the alkali metal salt may be<br>
removed by filtering. Any anhydrous organic solvent may be used with no particular<br>
limitation, as long as the anhydrous organic solvent is capable of dissolving the<br>
purified polymer. Particular examples of the anhydrous organic solvent include low-<br>
toxic solvents with a low boiling point, such as acetone and acetonitrile.<br>
After removing the salt compound and the alkali metal salt as described above,<br>
the organic solvent is finally removed from the purified polymer-containing organic<br>
solution. Herein, the organic solvent may be removed via a known fractional<br>
distillation process or a (solvent/non-solvent) precipitation process. More particularly,<br>
fractional distillation may be used to remove the organic solvent, for example, at a<br>
temperature of 60-80 °C.<br>
The amphophilic block copolymer according to one example embodiment<br>
includes an A-B type diblock copolymer or a B-A-B type triblock copolymer consisting<br>
of a hydrophilic block (A) and a hydrophobic block (B). The amphiphilic block<br>
copolymer has a hydrophilic block content of 20 wt%-95 wt%, more particularly 40 wt<br>
%-95 wt%, and a hydrophobic block content of 5 wt%-80 wt%, more particularly 5 wt<br>
%-60 wt%. The amphiphilic block copolymer may have a number average molecular<br>
weight of 1,000 Daltons to 50,000 Daltons, more particularly 1,500 Daltons to 20,000<br>
Daltons.<br>
The hydrophilic polymer block includes a biocompatible polymer such as<br>
polyethylene glycol or a derivative thereof, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyvinyl alcohol or<br>
polyacrylamide. More particularly, the hydrophilic polymer block includes<br>
polyethylene glycol or monomethoxypolyethylene glycol. The hydrophilic block may<br>
have a number average molecular weight of 200 Daltons to 20,000 Daltons, specifically<br>
200 Daltons to 10,000 Daltons.<br>
The hydrophobic polymer block includes a biodegradable polymer such as a<br>
polymer of monomers derived from a-hydroxy acid. The hydrophobic polymer block<br>
may include at least one polymer selected from the group consisting of polylactide,<br>
polyglycolide, poly(mandelic acid), polycaprolactone or poly(dioxan-2-one),<br>
copolymers thereof, polyaminoacids, polyorthoesters, polyanhydrides and<br>
polycarbonates. More particularly, the hydrophobic polymer block includes polylactide,<br>
polyglycolide, polycaprolactone or poly(dioxan-2-one).<br>
The amphiphilic block copolymer including a hydrophobic polymer block of a<br>
poly(a-hydroxy acid) may be synthesized via a known ring-opening polymerization<br>
process using a hydroxyl group-containing hydrophilic polymer as initiators and<br>
lactone monomers of a-hydroxy acid. For example, hydroxyl group-containing<br>
hydrophilic polyethylene glycol or monomethoxypolyethylene glycol may be used as<br>
an initiator to perform ring-opening polymerization of L-lactide or D,L-lactide. Diblock<br>
or triblock copolymers may be obtained depending on the number of hydroxyl groups<br>
present in the hydrophilic block as an initiator. Upon the ring-opening polymerization,<br>
an organometal catalyst such as stannous oxide, lead oxide, stannous octoate or<br>
antimony octoate may be used. When preparing a medical polymer, stannous octoate<br>
may be used as an organometal catalyst because it has biocompatibility.<br>
However, the amphiphilic block copolymer obtained from the above<br>
polymerization process still includes unreacted lactone monomer compounds of an a-<br>
hydroxy acid such as lactide, decomposition products of the lactone monomers, low<br>
molecular weight a-hydroxy acid oligomers and the organometal catalyst.<br>
The lactone monomers, decomposition products thereof and low molecular<br>
weight a-hydroxy acid oligomers are easily decomposed in vivo and in an aqueous<br>
solution, resulting in a drop of pH. This accelerates decomposition of the resultant<br>
polymer or adversely affects the stability of a drug contained in the polymer, thereby<br>
causing generation of impurities. Additionally, the organometal catalyst contained in<br>
the resultant polymer as an impurity accelerates hydrolysis of the hydrophobic block<br>
and causes a drop of molecular weight, resulting in a drop of pH. Such accelerated<br>
hydrolysis caused by the organometal catalyst impurity inhibits the hydrophobic block<br>
used as a drug carrier in a formulated composition from releasing the drug<br>
continuously, resulting in undesired rapid drug release and a failure in controlling the<br>
drug release rate. Therefore, when applying the amphiphilic block copolymer<br>
disclosed herein to drug carriers, it is required to control the amounts of the monomers,<br>
oligomers and organometal catalyst present in combination with the amphiphilic block<br>
copolymer in order to control the drug release rate and to prevent generation of<br>
impurities.<br>
In this context, there is provided a highly pure amphiphilic block copolymer<br>
including a hydrophobic polymer block of a poly(a-hydroxy acid), the copolymer<br>
having a content of lactone monomers of an a-hydroxy acid of 1.0 wt% or less based on<br>
the total weight of the copolymer, and a content of metal of an organometal catalyst of<br>
50 ppm or less based on the total weight of the copolymer. More particularly, the highly<br>
pure amphiphilic block copolymer including a hydrophobic polymer block of a poly(a-<br>
hydroxy acid) has a content of lactone monomers of an a-hydroxy acid of 0.5 wt% or<br>
less based on the total weight of the copolymer, and a content of metal of an<br>
organometal catalyst of 20 ppm or less based on the total weight of the copolymer.<br>
According to an example embodiment, there is provided a highly pure amphiphilic<br>
block copolymer including a polymer block of polylactide, the copolymer having a<br>
lactide content of 1.0 wt% or less based on the total weight of the copolymer, and a<br>
content of metal of an organometal catalyst of 50 ppm or less based on the total weight<br>
of the copolymer. A lactone monomer content greater than 1.0 wt% accelerates<br>
decomposition of the polymer and adversely affects the stability of a drug contained in<br>
the polymer, thereby causing generation of impurities. In addition, an organometal<br>
catalyst content greater than 50 ppm accelerates hydrolysis of the hydrophobic block<br>
and causes a drop of pH, which leads to a failure in continuous and controlled drug<br>
release.<br>
According to one embodiment, the amphiphilic block copolymer including a<br>
hydrophobic polymer block of a poly(a-hydroxy acid) is represented by the above<br>
Formula 1.<br>
Further, disclosed is a pharmaceutical composition of microspheres, polymer<br>
micelles, etc. containing the highly pure amphiphilic block copolymer including a<br>
hydrophobic polymer block of a poly(a-hydroxy acid).<br>
The examples will now be described. The following examples are for<br>
illustrative purposes only and not intended to limit the scope of this disclosure.<br>
Preparation Example 1. Synthesis of mPEG-PLA Diblock Copolymer Including<br>
Monomethoxypolyethylene Glycol and D,L-Lactide<br>
First, 100 g of monomethoxypolyethylene glycol (mPEG: number average<br>
molecular weight 2,000) was introduced into a 250 mL round-bottom flask equipped<br>
with an agitator, and was dehydrated while being agitated at 120 °C for 2 hours under<br>
vacuum. Next, 0.1 g of stannous octoate (Sn(Oct)2) dissolved in 200 µL of toluene was<br>
further added to the reaction flask, and toluene was removed via distillation while<br>
agitating the reaction mixture for 1 hour under vacuum.<br>
Then, 100 g of D,L-lactide was added thereto and dissolved therein with stirring<br>
under nitrogen atmosphere. After the completion of the dissolution of D,L-lactide, the<br>
reactor was sealed to carry out a reaction at 120 °C for 20 hours. After the completion<br>
of the reaction, 193 g of a crude diblock copolymer mPEG-PLA (number average<br>
molecular weight: 3,725 Daltons) was obtained. Finally, the product was analyzed by<br>
1H-NMR, and the molecular weight of the diblock copolymer was was determined by<br>
calculating the intensity on the basis of -OCH3, i.e., the terminal group of<br>
monomethoxypolyethylene glycol. Fig. 1 shows the 1H-NMR spectrum of the resultant<br>
amphiphilic copolymer. Lactide monomers were identified at 1.5 ppm and 5.0 ppm.<br>
Comparative Example 1. Purification of mPEG-PLA Diblock Copolymer via<br>
Sublimation Process<br>
First, 50 g of the mPEG-PLA obtained from Preparation Example 1 was<br>
introduced into a flask and dissolved at 120 °C. While agitating the polymer with a<br>
magnetic bar, the reaction flask was connected to a vacuum pump to remove lactide at 1<br>
torr or below via sublimation. After the sublimation, lactide was precipitated on the<br>
surface of the flask, and the precipitate was removed to obtain 46 g of a purified mPEG-<br>
PLA in a molten state. Then, the lactide content and Sn (catalyst) content were<br>
measured. The results are shown in the following Table 1.<br>
Comparative Example 2. Purification of mPEG-PLA Diblock Copolymer via<br>
Solvent/Non-Solvent Purification Process<br>
First, 50 g of the mPEG-PLA obtained from Preparation Example 1 was<br>
dissolved in 100 mL of methylene chloride, and the solution was added gradually 1 L of<br>
diethyl ether under agitation to cause precipitation of the polymer in the form of<br>
particles. The polymer obtained after the precipitation was filtered, and then dried in a<br>
vacuum oven for 24 hours to obtain 43 g of a purified mPEG-PLA in the form of white<br>
solid particles. Then, the lactide content and Sn (catalyst) content were measured. The<br>
results are shown in the following Table 1.<br>
Example 1. Purification of mPEG-PLA Diblock Copolymer<br>
First, 50 g of the mPEG-PLA obtained from Preparation Example 1 was added<br>
to 100 mL of acetonitrile and dissolved therein. To the mPEG-PLA dissolved in<br>
acetonitrile, 100 mL of an aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution (0.1 g/mL) was added<br>
gradually, and the resultant mixture was agitated at 60 °C for 2 hours. Next, 10 g of<br>
sodium chloride was added thereto, and agitated and dissolved at room temperature,<br>
thereby causing phase separation between the two kinds of solvents at room<br>
temperature. The resultant two solvent layers were separated from each other by using<br>
a separatory funnel, and the organic solvent layer was collected. To the organic solvent<br>
layer, 100 mL of distilled water and 10 g of sodium chloride were added and dissolved<br>
with stirring. The resultant two solvent layers were separated again by using a<br>
separatory funnel and the organic solvent layer was collected. The organic solvent layer<br>
was subjected to fractional distillation at 80 °C for 2 hours under vacuum to remove<br>
acetonitrile and water completely. After that, 100 mL of anhydrous acetonitrile was<br>
added to cause precipitation of sodium chloride and sodium bicarbonate incorporated in<br>
the polymer during the dissolution thereof. The precipitate was separated off and<br>
acetonitrile was removed by carrying out fractional distillation at 80 °C for 2 hours<br>
under vacuum to obtain 45 g of a purified mPEG-PLA. Then, the lactide content and Sn<br>
(catalyst) content were measured. The results are shown in the following Table 1. In<br>
addition, 1H-NMR of the purified mPEG-PLA revealed that the peaks corresponding to<br>
lactide monomers were significantly reduced (see Fig. 2).<br>
Example 2. Purification of mPEG-PLA Diblock Copolymer<br>
Example 1 was repeated except that 50 mL of an aqueous sodium bicarbonate<br>
solution (0.1 g/mL) was added gradually to mPEG-PLA to obtain 47 g of a purified<br>
mPEG-PLA. Then, the lactide content and Sn (catalyst) content were measured. The<br>
results are shown in the following Table 1.<br>
Example 3. Purification of mPEG-PLA Diblock Copolymer<br>
Example 1 was repeated except that the hydrolysis of monomers was carried<br>
out under agitation at 40 °C for 2 hours to obtain 47 g of a purified mPEG-PLA. Then,<br>
the lactide content and Sn (catalyst) content were measured. The results are shown in<br>
the following Table 1.<br><br>
intensity on the basis of -OCH3, i.e., the terminal group of monomethoxypolyethylene<br>
glycol.<br>
b) Sn content was determined by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) emission<br>
spectroscopy.<br>
As can be seen from Table 1, the mPEG-PLA is prepared via ring-opening<br>
polymerization of D,L-lactide using stannous octoate as an organometal catalyst. The<br>
crude mPEG-PLA obtained from Preparation Example 1 contains a significant amount<br>
of lactide and organometal. In the mPEG-PLA purified via a sublimation process<br>
according to Comparative Example 1, lactide and the catalyst still remain with a very<br>
slight reduction in content. In addition, although the solvent/non-solvent purification<br>
process according to Comparative Example 2 is somewhat effective for removing<br>
lactide, it has substantially no effect on the removal of the organometal. Even though<br>
the catalyst used for the polymerization is an FDA approved chemical, any catalyst<br>
remaining in the final polymer may accelerate the hydrolysis of the polymer, thereby<br>
causing degradation of the physical properties of the polymer. On the contrary,<br>
according to the purification method disclosed herein, which includes hydrolysis of<br>
monomers and liquid/liquid phase separation, it is possible to reduce the residual<br>
monomer content as well as the organometal catalyst content significantly in the<br>
purified polymer.<br>
While the exemplary embodiments have been shown and described, it will be<br>
understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be<br>
made thereto without departing from the spirit and scope of this disclosure as defined by<br>
the appended claims.<br>
In addition, many modifications can be made to adapt a particular situation or<br>
material to the teachings of this disclosure without departing from the essential scope<br>
thereof. Therefore, it is intended that this disclosure not be limited to the particular<br>
exemplary embodiments disclosed as the best mode contemplated for carrying out this<br>
disclosure, but that this disclosure will include all embodiments falling within the scope<br>
of the appended claims.<br>
