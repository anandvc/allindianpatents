				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
TGFß (Transforming Growth Factor ß) is a member of a large family of dimeric polypeptide growth factors that includes activins, inhibins, bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), growth and differentiation factors (GDFs) and mullerian inhibiting substance (MIS).  TGFß exists in three isoforms (TGFß1, TGFß2, and TGFß3) and is present in most cells, along with its receptors. Each isoform is expressed in both a tissue-specific and developmentally regulated fashion. Each TGFß isoform is synthesized as a precursor protein that is cleaved intracellularly into a C-terminal region (latency associated peptide (LAP)) and an N-terminal region known as mature or active TGFß. LAP is typically non-covalently associated with mature TGFß prior to secretion from the cell. The LAP- TGFß complex cannot bind to the TGFß receptors and is not biologically active. TGFß is generally released (and activated) from the complex by a variety of  mechanisms including interaction with thrombospondin-1 or plasmin.<br>
Following activation, TGFß binds at high affinity to the type II receptor (TGFßRII), a constitutively active serine/threonine kinase. The ligand-bound type II receptor phosphorylates the TGFß type I receptor (Alk 5) in a glycine/serine rich domain, which allows the type I receptor to recruit and phosphorylate downstream signaling molecules, Smad2 or Smad3. See, e.g., Huse, M. et al., Mol. Cell. 8: 671-682 (2001). Phosphorylated Smad2 or Smad3 can then complex with Smad4, and the entire hetero-Smad complex translocates to the nucleus and regulates transcription of various TGFß-responsive genes.   See, e.g., Massague, J. Ann. Rev .Biochem. Med. 67: 773 (1998).<br>
Activins are also members of the TGFß superfamily which are distinct from TGFß in that they are homo- or heterodimers of activin ßa or ßb. Activins signal in a similar manner to TGFß , that is, by binding to a constitutive serine-threonine receptor kinase, activin type II receptor (ActRIIB), and activating a type I serine-threonine receptor, Alk 4, to phosphorylate Smad2 or Smad3. The consequent formation of a hetero-Smad complex with Smad4 also results in the activin-induced regulation of gene transcription.<br><br>
ludeed, TGFβ and related factors such as activin regulate a large array of<br>
cellular processes, e.g., cell cycle arrest in epithelial and hematopoietic cells, control of mesenchymal cell proliferation and differentiation, inflammatory cell recruitment, immunosuppression, wound healing, and extracellular matrix production. See, e.g., Massague, J. Ann. Rev. Cell. Biol. 6: 594-641. (1990); Roberts, A. B. and Sporn M. B. Peptide Growth Factors and Their Receptors, 95:419-472 Berlin: Springer-Verlag (1990); Roberts, A. B. and Sporn M. B. Growth Factors 8:1-9 (1993); and Alexandrow, M. G., Moses, H. L. Cancer Res. 55:1452-1457 (1995). Hyperactivity of TGFβ signaling pathway underlies many human disorders (e.g., excess deposition of extracellular matrix, an abnormally high level of inflammatory responses, fibrotic disorders, and progressive cancers). Similarly, activin signaling and overexpression of activin is linked to pathological disorders that involve extracellular matrix accumulation and fibrosis (see, e.g., Matsuse, T. et al, Am. J. Respir. CellMol. Biol. 13: 17-24(1995); Inoue, S. etal.,Biochem. Biophys.Res. Canon. 205: 441-448 (1994); Matsuse, T. et al, Am. J. Pathol. 148: 707-713 (1996); De Bleser et al.3 Hepatology 26: 905-912 (1997); Pawlowski, J.E., et al., J. Clin. Invest. 100: 639-648 (1997); Sugiyama, M. et al., Gastroenterology 114: 550-558 (1998); Munz, B. et al., EMBOJ. 18: 5205-<br>
%<br>
5215 (1999)), inflammatory responses (see, e.g., Rosendahl, A. et al.,Am. J. Repir. Cell Mol. Biol. 25: 60-68 (2001)), cachexia or wasting (see Matzuk, M. M. et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 91: 8817-8821 (1994); Coerver, K.A. etal,Mo/. Endocrinol 10: 534-543 (1996); Cipriano, S.C. et al. Endocrinology 141: 2319-27 (2000)), diseases of or pathological responses in the central nervous system (see Logan, A. et al. Eur. J. Neurosci. 11: 2367-2374 (1999); Logan, A. et al. Exp. Neurol 159: 504-510 (1999); Masliah, E. et al., Nenrochem. Int. 39: 393-400 (2001); De Groot, C. J. A. et al, J. NeuropatJwl. Exp. Neurol. 58: 174-187 (1999), John, G. R. et zl,NatMed. 8: 1115-21 (2002)) and hypertension (see Dahly, A. J. et al., Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 283: R757-67 (2002)). Studies have also shown that TGFP and activin can act synergistically to induce extracellular matrix (see, e.g., Sugiyama, M. et al.,<br><br>
Gastroenterology 114: 550-558, (1998)). It is therefore desirable to develop modulators (e.g., antagonists) to signaling pathway components of the TGFp family to prevent/treat disorders related to the malfunctioning of this signaling pathway.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention is based on the discoveiy that compounds of formula (I) are unexpectedly potent antagonists of the TGFJβ family type I receptors, Alk5 and/or Alk 4. Thus, compounds of formula (I) can be employed in the prevention and/or treatment of diseases such as fibrosis (e.g., renal fibrosis, pulmonary fibrosis, and hepatic fibrosis), progressive cancers, or other diseases for which reduction of TGFJβ family signaling activity is desirable.<br>
In one aspect, the invention features a compound of formula I:<br><br>

An AT-oxide derivative or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of each of the compounds of formula (I) is also within the scope of this invention. For example, a nitrogen ring atom of the pyrazole core ring or a nitrogen-containing heterocyclyl substituent can form an oxide in the presence of a suitable oxidizing agent such as m-chloroperbenzoic acid or H2O2.<br>
A compound of formula (I) that is acidic in nature (e.g., having a carboxyl or phenolic hydroxyl group) can form a pharmaceutically acceptable salt such as a sodium, potassium, calcium, or gold salt Also within the scope of the invention are salts fonned with pharmaceutically acceptable amines such as ammonia, alkyl amines, hydroxyalkylamines, and N-methylglycamine. A compound of formula (I) can be treated with an acid to form acid addition salts. Examples of such an acid include hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydroiodic acid, sulfuric acid, methanesulfonic<br>
acid, phosphoric acid,p-bromophenyl-sulfonic acid, carbonic acid, succinic acid, citric<br>
acid, benzoic acid, oxalic acid, malonic acid, salicylic acid, malic acid, fumaric acid, ascorbic acid, maleic acid, acetic acid, and other mineral and organic acids well known to a skilled person in the art. The acid addition salts can be prepared by treating a compound of formula (I) in its free base form with a sufficient amount of an acid (e.g., hydrochloric acid) to produce an acid addition salt (e.g., a hydrochlorde salt). The acid addition salt can be converted back to its free base form by treating the salt with a suitable dilute aqueous basic solution (e.g., sodium hydroxide, sodium bicarbonate, potassium carbonate, or ammonia).

An antagonist is a molecule that binds to the receptor without activating the receptor. It competes with the endogenous ligand(s) or substrate(s) for binding site(s) on the receptor and, thus inhibits the ability of the receptor to transduce an intracellular signal in response to endogenous ligand binding.<br>
As compounds of formula (I) are antagonists of TGF0 receptor type I (Alk5) and/or activin receptor type I (Alk4), these compounds are useful in inhibiting the consequences of TGFβ and/or activin signal transduction such as the production of extracellular matrix (e.g., collagen and fibronectin), the differentiation of stromal cells to myofibroblasts, and the stimulation of and migration of inflammatory cells. Thus, compounds of formula (I) inhibit pathological inflammatory and fibrotic responses and possess the therapuetical utility of treating and/or preventing disorders or diseases for which reduction of TGFP and/or activin activity is desirable (e.g., various types of fibrosis or progressive cancers).<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In general, the invention features compounds of formula (I), which exhibit surprisingly high affinity for the TGFp family type I receptors, Alk 5 and/or Alk 4.<br>
Synthesis of Compounds of formula (T)<br>
Compounds of formula (I) may be prepared by a number of known methods from commercially available or known starting materials. In one method, a compound of formula (I) are prepared according to Scheme 1 below. Specifically, a pyridine of formula (II), which contains a 2-(a, pMinsaturated carbonyl) substituent can cyclize with hydrazine to form a pyrazole core ring to produce a 2-(pyrazol-3-yl)-pyridine intermediate (III). Note that the pyridine of formula (II) is commercially available (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, catalog number 51,167-6) or can be prepared by known methods (see, e.g., Jameson, D. and Guise, L. Tetrahedron Letters, 32(18): 1999-2002. The intermediate (III) can be further substituted at the 4-position of the pyrazole core ring with a good leaving group such as iodo by reacting with an iodination reagent (e.g., N-iodosuccimmide) to form a 2-(4-iodo-pyrazol-3-yl)-pyridine (IV). The iodo substituent forms an ideal platform for R substitutions. For example, the iodo substituent can be converted into a boronic acid substituent (see compound (V) below), which can react with a R6-halide (VI) (e.g., an aryl halide or a heteroaryl .halide) via Suzuki coupling reaction to form a compound of formula (I). See, e.g., Example 1 below. Other substitution reactions can also be employed to produce a wide range of compounds of formula (I) (see, e.g., via a reaction between the protected iodinated compound (IVa) and phthalic anhydride to form a di-keto intermediate (VII), which can undergo a cyclization reaction with an Rg-substituted hydrazine to form a compound (I); for reference, see J. Med. Chem., 44(16): 2511-2522 (2001); see also Examples 3 and 4 below). It should be noted that the pyrazole core ring should be<br>
properly protected (see, e.g., the N,N-dimethyIaminosulfonyl group of compound<br>
(IVa)) to eliminate undesired side reactions.<br>

Compounds of formula (VI) are commercially available or can be prepared by known methods. Some exemplary reactions for preparing a compound of formula (VI) are shown below in Scheme 2. See also Examples A-I below.<br>
Scheme 2<br>
(Figure Removed)<br><br>
Alternatively, a compound of formula (I) can be formed via a phenylaceryl pyridine compound (IX) as shown in Scheme 3 below. Specifically, a pyridine-carboxyaldehyde compound (VIII) is converted to the N,P acetal intermediate with aniline and diphenylphosphite. This acetal intermediate is men coupled to an aldehyde substituted with R6 in basic condition (e.g., Cs2CCO3) to afford an enamine intermediate, which is hydrolyzed to the ketone intermediate of formula (DC). For reference, see, e.g., Journet et al, Tetrahedron Letters v. 39, p. 1717-1720 (1998). Cyclizing the ketone intermediate (IX) with N,N-dimethylformamide dimethyl acetal (DMFDMA) and hydrazine affords the pyrazole ring of the desired compound of formula (I). See, e.g., Example 5 below. The pyrazole ring of a compound of formula (I) can also be formed by cyclizing the ketone intermediate (IX) with an R5-substituted carboxylic acid hydrazide (X). For reference, see, e.g., Chemistry ofHeterocyclic compounds 35(11): 1319-1324(2000).<br>
Scheme 3<br>
(Figure Removed)<br><br>
Another method of preparing the intermediate (IX) is depicted in Scheme 4 below. For reference, see, e.g., WO 02/066462, WO 02/062792, and WO 02/062787.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Some methods for preparing a compound of formula (I) wherein -R1-R2-R3-R4 is not hydrogen are shown in Scheme 5 below. In reaction (A) below, a compound of formula (I) wherein the 1-position of the pyrazole core ring is unsubstituted undergoes a substitution reaction with X-R'-R2R3R4 where X is a leaving group such as trifluoromethylsulfonate, tosylate, and halide, e.g., Cl, Br, or I (see, e.g., Examples 6-9). Alternatively, a compound of formula (I) wherein the 1-position of the pyrazole core ring is unsubstituted can undergo a conjugate addition reaction as shown in reaction (B) below. As is well known to a skilled person in the art, the electropbile or acceptor in the addition reaction generally contains a double bond connecting to an electron-withdrawing group or a double bond conjugating to groups such as carbonyl,<br>
cyano, or nitro. See, e.g., Example 10 below.<br>
Scheme 5<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
The -R!-R2-R3-R4 group can be further transformed into other functionalities as shown in Scheme 6 below. For example, a compound of formula (I) wherein the -R1-R2-R3-R4 group is cyanoalkyl can be reduced to aminoalkyl, which can be further converted to other functionalities such as heteroaralkyl, heterocycloalkylalkyl, and carboxylic acid. See, e.g., Examples 11-18 below.<br>
Scheme 6<br>
(Figure Removed)<br><br><br><br>
Substituents at the 2- ring (i.e., Ra) can also be converted into other functionalities. For example, a compound of formula (I) wherein Ra is bromo (can be obtained by employing a bromo-substituted compound of formula (VIII) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) can be converted into functionalities such as alkyl, alkenyl, cycloalkyl and the like as described in Examples 19-22.<br>
Likewise, substituents of the R6 moiety can be further converted into other functionalities as well. See, e.g., Example 23.<br>
As will be obvious to a skilled person in the art, some starting materials and intermediates may need to be protected before undergoing synthetic steps as described above. For suitable protecting groups, see, e.g., T. W. Greene, Protective Groups in<br>
Organic Synthesis, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York (1981).<br>
Uses of Compounds of formula (I)<br>
As discussed above, hyperactivity of the TGFP family signaling pathways can result in excess deposition of extracellular matrix and increased inflammatory responses, which can then lead to fibrosis in tissues and organs (e.g., lung, kidney, and liver) and ultimately result in organ failure. See, e.g., Border, W.A. and Ruoslahti E. J. Clin. Invest. 90: 1-7 (1992) and Border, W.A. and Noble, N.A. N. Engl J. Med. 331: 1286-1292 (1994). Studies have been shown that the expression of TGFβ and/or activin mRNA and the level of TGFp and/or activin are increased in patients suffering from various fibrotic disorders, e.g., fibrotic kidney diseases, alcohol-induced and autoimmune hepatic fibrosis, myelofibrosis, bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Elevated TGFP and/or activin is has also been demonstrated in cachexia, demyelination of neurons in multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, cerebral angiopathy and hypertension.<br>
Compounds of formula (I), which are antagonists of the TGFP family type I receptors, Alk 5 and/or Alk 4, and inhibit TGFP and/or activin signaling pathway, are therefore useful for treating and/or preventing disorders or diseases mediated by an increased level of TGFP and/or activin activity. As used herein, a compound inhibits the TGFP family signaling pathway when it binds (e.g., with an ICso value of less than 10 uM; preferably, less than 1 uM; more preferably, less than 0.1 uM) to a receptor of the pathway (e.g., Alk 5 and/or Alk 4), thereby competing with the endogenous ligand(s) or substrate(s) for binding site(s) on the receptor and reducing the ability of the receptor to transduce an intracellular signal in response to the endogenous ligand or substrate binding. The aforementioned disorders or diseases include any conditions (a) marked by the presence of an abnormally high level of TGFP and/or activin; and/or (b) an excess accumulation of extracellular matrix; and/or (c) an increased number and synthetic activity of myofibroblasts. These disorders or diseases include, but are not limited to, fibrotic conditions such as scleroderma, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, glomerulonephritis, diabetic nephropathy, lupus nephritis, hypertension-induced nephropathy, ocular or cornea! scarring, hepatic or biliary fibrosis, acute lung injury, pulmonary fibrosis, post-infarction cardiac fibrosis, fibrosclerosis, fibrotic cancers, fibroids, fibroma, fibroadenomas, and fibrosarcomas. Other fibrotic conditions for which preventive treatment with compounds of formula (I) can have therapeutic utility include radiation therapy-induced fibrosis, chemotherapy-induced fibrosis, surgically induced scarring including surgical adhesions, laminectomy, and coronary restenosis. Increased TGFP activity is also found to manifest in patients with progressive cancers. Studies have shown that in late stages of various cancers, both the tumor cells and the stromal cells within the rumors generally overexpress TGFp. This leads to stimulation of angiogenesis and cell motility, suppression of the immune system, and increased interaction of rumor cells with the extracellular matrix. See, e.g., Hojo, M. et al., Nature 397: 530-534 (1999). As a result, the tumors cells become more invasive and metastasize to distant organs. See, e.g., Maehara, Y. et al., J. Clin. Oncol. 17: 607-614 (1999) and Picon, A. et al., Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prev. 7:497-504 (1998). Thus, compounds of formula (I), which are antagonists of the TGFP type I receptor and inhibit TGFP signaling pathway, are also useful for treating and/or preventing various late stage cancers which overexpress TGFp. Such late stage cancers include carcinomas of the lung, breast, liver, biliary tract, gastrointestinal tract, head .   and neck, pancreas, prostate, cervix as well as multiple myeloma, melanoma, glioma, and glioblastomas.<br>
Importantly, it should be pointed out that because of the chronic and in some cases localized nature of disorders or diseases mediated by overexpression of TGFP and/or activin (e.g., fibrosis or cancers), small molecule treatments (such as treatment disclosed in the present invention) are favored for long-term treatment.<br>
Not only are compounds of formula (I) useful in treating disorders or diseases mediated by high levels of TGFp and/or activin activity, these compounds can also be used to prevent the same disorders or diseases. It is known that polymorphisms leading to increased TGFP and/or activin production have been associated with fibrosis and hypertension. Indeed, high serum TGFP levels are correlated with the development of fibrosis in patients with breast cancer who have received radiation therapy, chronic graft-versus-host-disease, idiopathic interstitial pneumonitis, veno-occlusive disease in transplant recipients, and peritoneal fibrosis in patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. Thus, the levels of TGFP and/or activin in serum and of TGFP and/or activin mRNA in tissue can be measured and used as diagnostic or prognostic markers for disorders or diseases mediated by overexpression of TGFp and/or activin, and polymoiphisms in the gene for TGFJβ that determine the production of TGFJ3 and/or activin can also be used in predicting susceptibility to disorders or diseases.

This mixture was heated to reflux for 3 hours and allowed to cool to room temperature. 19 mL (38 mmol, 2 equiv.) of a 2.0 M solution of methylamine in THF was then added to the mixture, which resulted in some gas evolution. The resulting mixture was heated to reflux and stirred for 2 hours, allowed to cool to room temperature and concentrated in vacuo to a purple/brown oil. This oil was dissolved in ethyl acetate, washed three times with IN NaOH, twice with a 5% citric acid solution, then brine, dried (Na2SO4), filtered, and concentrated to a purple solid. This solid was dissolved in hot EtOH, to which water was added until turbid. The reaction mixture was then cooled at 0 °C overnight to give a precipitate. The precipitate was isolated by vacuum filtration, washed with water, and air-dried to -give 2-amino-5-iodo-N-methyl-benzamide.

Assay for Evaluating Cellular Inhibition of TGFβ Signaling and Cytotoxicity<br>
Biological activity of compounds of formula (I) were determined by measuring their ability to inhibit TGFβ-induced PAI-Luciferase reporter activity in HepG2 cells.<br>
HepG2 cells were stably transfected with the PAI-luciferase reporter grown in DMEM medium containing 10% FBS, penicillin (100 U/ml), streptomycin (100 ug/ml), L-glutamine (2 mM), sodium pyruvate (1 mM), and non essential amino acids (Ix). The transfected cells were then plated at a concentration of 2.5 x 104 cells/well in 96 well plates and starved for 3-6 hours in media with 0.5% FBS at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator. The cells were then stimulated with ligand either 2.5 ng/ml TGFβ in the starvation media containing 1 % DM SO and the presence or absence of test compounds of of formula (I) and incubated as described above for 24 hours. The media was washed out in the following day and the luciferase reporter activity was detected using the LucLite Luciferase Reporter Gene Assay kit (Packard, cat. no. 6016911) as recommended. The plates were read on a Wallac Microbeta plate reader, the reading of which was used to determine the ICso values of compounds of formula (I) for inhibiting TGFp-induced PAI-Luciferase reporter activity in HepG2 cells. Compounds of formula (I) typically exhibited IC50 values of less 10 uM.<br>
Cytotoxicity was determined using the same cell culture conditions as described above. Specifically, cell viability was determined after overnight incubation with the CytoLite cell viability kit (Packard, cat. no. 6016901). Compounds of formula (I) typically exhibited LDas values greater than 10 uM.<br>

Example 121<br>
Assay for TGFβ-Induced Collagen Expression<br>
Preparation of Immortalized Collagen Promotor-Green Fluorescent Protein Cells Fibroblasts were derived from the skin of adult transgenic mice expressing Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) under the control of the collagen 1A1 promoter (see Krempen, K. et al., Gene Exp. 8: 151-163 (1999)). Cells were immortalised with a temperature sensitive large T antigen that is active at 33°C. Cells are expanded at 33°C then transferred to 37°C so that the large T becomes inactive (see Xu, S. et al., Exp. Cell Res. 220: 407-414 (1995)). Over the course of about 4 days and one split, the cells cease proliferating. Cells are then frozen in aliquots sufficient for a single 96 well plate. Assay of TGFβ-induced Collagen-GFP Expression<br>
Cells are thawed, plated in complete DMEM (contains nonessential amino acids, ImM sodium pyruvate and 2mM L-glutamine) with 10 % fetal calf serum and incubated overnight at 37°C, 5% CO2. The following day, the cells are trypsinized and transferred into 96 well format with 30,000 cells per well in 50 ul complete DMEM containing 2 % fetal calf serum, but without phenol red. The cells are incubated at 37°C for 3 to 4 hours to allow them to adhere to the plate, solutions containing test compounds of formula (I) are then added to triplicate wells with no TGFp\ as well as triplicate wells with 1 ng/ml TGFp. DMSO was also added to all of the wells at a final concentration of 0.1%. GFP fluorescence emission at 530 nm following excitation at 485 nm was measured at 48 hours after the addition of solution containing test compounds.on a CytoFluor microplate reader (PerSeptive Biosystems). The data are then expressed as the ratio of TGFp-induced to non-induced for each test sample.<br>
