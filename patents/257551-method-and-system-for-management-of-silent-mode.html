The following Specification describes the nature of the invention<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention, in general, relates to the field when a mobile user is in silent mode and could not notice an incoming call hence misses it. More particularly the present invention relates to a method of informing the caller about the called party silent mode and the silent mode is scheduled based to indicate the user about the mode and other information that mobile has got during that particular mode.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
In the existing scenario a mobile user may put the phone in silent mode in the office or in some meeting. Sometimes the user forgets to put it back in normal mode (for e.g. even after going home) and misses some calls. It is quite possible that the user can miss some very important calls.<br>
The caller doesn't know why the called party is not responding. The caller just knows that there is “No Response” from the called party.<br>
There is no technology to<br>
§ Indicate to the caller that the called party is in silent mode<br>
§ Enable the called party to be alerted in silent mode under some conditions, <br>
based on scheduler and other possible ways.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWING<br>
Figure 1 depicts how the "Silent mode "information will be passed to the caller.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention will help to inform the caller that the called party is in silent mode when the called party is in silent mode, and also reminding the user that mobile is<br>
2 <br>
in silent mode based on the scheduler, missed call information.<br>
Silent Mode Indication: At present when a called party does not respond to a call the caller receives an indication saying that there is “No Response” from the user. In the proposed invention the caller will be informed that the called party is in silent mode. The indication would look like this: “No Response. Called party in silent mode”.<br>
The advantage of proposed invention is that the caller will at least know why the called party is not responding.<br>
§ Timed Silent Mode: In the proposed invention user will be given an option to put the phone in silent mode for a certain period of time (for e.g. 1hr, 2hrs etc). After the expiry of that time the phone will either return to normal mode or prompt the user to take the necessary action.<br>
§ Alert after repeated missed calls: In silent mode if the user receives more than ‘n’ missed calls from the same number a special beep or ring tone can be played. The value of ‘n’ can be set by the user.<br>
This can be made feasible as follows:<br>
§ Silent Mode Indication: The called party sends “alert” message to the network after call confirmation. The alert message contains a filled  “User-user information element” (Table 10.5.131/3GPP TS 24.008) which can be used to inform the caller that the called party is in silent mode. If there is no response from the called party the caller UE can display the message “No Response. Called party in silent mode”. The contents of “alert” message are shown below:<br>
§ Timed Silent Mode: When the user selects the option for entering the silent mode, a new option in the Ul will be given to the user for entering the duration, to indicate how long the mobile to be in the silent mode. Once the preset duration is over mobile reminds the user that the mobile was kept in the silent mode, depending on the user situation either he can continue the silent mode<br>
3<br><br>
or come to normal mode.<br>
§ Alert after repeated missed calls: When the UE is in silent mode and the user is not responding to any call the application can alert the user if the missed calls from a particular number exceed the limit set by the user. However, the user should not be alerted if he does not respond to the call but is still using the UE (this means that he knows that there is a missed call).<br>
§ However in order to implement the proposed invention the network should support the User-user information field and forward it to the caller.<br>
On MT Side:<br>
1. User A has set the mobile in the silent mode.<br>
2. User A gets the incoming call from User B.<br>
3. If User A will attend the call it will proceed in normal way.<br>
4. If User A will not attend the call, then after “n” rings the mobile will fill the message “Not Responding User in Silent mode” in the User-User Information element of the CC Message and sends the message.<br>
5. After this call proceeds in the normal way.<br>
On MO Side:<br>
1. User B Receives the CC Message and if the User-User information is present in the CC message it is displayed to the user.<br>

The present invention, in general, relates to the field where a mobile user is in silent mode and cannot notice an incoming call, hence misses it. More particularly the present invention relates to a method of informing the caller about the called party silent mode and the silent mode is scheduled based to indicate the user about the mode and other information that mobile has got during that particular mode. More particularly, the present invention relates to a method and system for automatic management of silent mode.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
In the existing scenario a mobile user may put the phone in silent mode in the office or in some meeting. Sometimes the user forgets to put it back in normal mode (for e.g. even after going home) and misses some calls. It is quite possible that the user can miss some very important calls.<br>

§ Enable the called party to be alerted in silent mode under some conditions, based on scheduler and other possible ways.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention proposed herein is applicable in a scenario where a mobile user is in silent mode and cannot notice an incoming call, hence the user misses the call. Further, the proposed invention would provide for informing the caller about the called party silent mode and the silent mode is scheduled based to indicate the user about the mode and other information that mobile has got during that particular mode.<br>
Accordingly, this invention explains a method for automatic management of silent mode comprising the steps of: On call terminator side:<br>
(a) setting the mobile in the silent mode by the terminator and configuring the maximum “n” rings for sending an alert message;<br>
(b) getting the incoming call from originator by the terminator;<br>
(c) proceeding the call in normal way if the terminator attends the said call;<br>
(d) filling the alert in the User-User Information element of the CC Message if the terminator does not attend the call after the set “n” rings;<br>
(e) sending the alert message by the terminator to the originator;<br>
On call originator Side:<br>
(f) receiving the User-User information in CC Message by the originator; and<br>
(g) displaying the said alert message to the originator.<br><br>
The terminator is given an option to put the phone in silent mode for a certain period of time and after the expiry of that time the phone will either return to normal mode or prompt the terminator to take a necessary action. The alert message can be generated after specific repeated missed calls. The alert message informs the originator that the terminator is in silent mode. The duration and continuation of the said silent mode can be configured when the terminator selects the option for entering the silent mode.<br>
Accordingly, this invention further explains a system for automatic management of silent mode comprising: On call terminator side:<br>
(a)	means for setting the mobile in the silent mode by the terminator and configuring the maximum “n” rings for sending an alert message;<br>
(b)	means for getting the incoming call from originator by the terminator;<br>
(c)	means for proceeding the call in normal way if the terminator attends the said call;<br>
(d)	means for filling the alert in the User-User Information element of the CC Message if the terminator does not attend the call after the set “n” rings;<br>
(e)	means for sending the alert message by the terminator to the originator;<br>
On call originator Side:<br>
(f)	means for receiving the User-User information in CC Message by the originator; and<br>
(g)	means for displaying the said alert message to the originator.<br><br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the ensuing detailed description of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWING<br>
Figure 1 depicts how the “Silent mode “information will be passed to the caller.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
This invention will help to inform the caller that the called party is in silent mode when the called party is in silent mode, and also reminding the user that mobile is<br>
in silent mode based on the scheduler, missed call information.<br>
§  Silent Mode Indication: At present when a called party does not respond to a call the caller receives an indication saying that there is “No Response” from the user. In the proposed invention the caller will be informed that the called party is in silent mode. The indication would look like this: “No Response. Called party in silent mode”.<br>
The advantage of proposed invention is that the caller will at least know why the called party is not responding.<br>
§  Timed Silent Mode: In the proposed invention user will be given an option to put the phone in silent mode for a certain period of time (for e.g. 1hr, 2hrs etc). After the expiry of that time the phone will either return to normal mode or prompt the user to take the necessary action.<br>
§ Alert after repeated missed calls: In silent mode if the user receives more than 'n' missed calls from the same number a special beep or ring tone can be played. The user can set the value of 'n'.<br>
This can be made feasible as follows;<br>
Silent Mode Indication: The called party sends “alert” message to the network after call confirmation. The alert message contains a filled “User-user information element” (Table 10.5.131/3GPP TS 24.008) which can be used to inform the caller that the called party is in silent mode. If there is no response<br>
from the called party the caller UE can display the message “No Response. Called party in silent mode". The contents of “alert” message are shown below: <br>
§ Timed Silent Mode: When the user selects the option for entering the silent mode, a new option in the Ul will be given to the user for entering the duration, to indicate how long the mobile to be in the silent mode. Once the preset duration is over mobile reminds the user that the mobile was kept in the silent mode, depending on the user situation either he can continue the silent mode or come to normal mode.<br>
§ Alert after repeated missed calls: When the UE is in silent mode and the user is not responding to any call the application can alert the user if the missed calls from a particular number exceed the limit set by the user. However, the user should not be alerted if he does not respond to the call but is still using the UE (this means that he knows that there is a missed call).<br>
§ However in order to implement the proposed invention the network should support the User-user information field and forward it to the caller.<br>
On MT Side:<br>
1. User A has set the mobile in the silent mode.<br>
2. User A gets the incoming call from User B.<br>
3. If User A will attend the call it will proceed in normal way.<br>
4. If User A will not attend the call, then after “n” rings the mobile will fill the message “Not Responding User in Silent mode” in the User-User Information element of the CC Message and sends the message.<br>
5. After this call proceeds in the normal way.<br><br>
On MO Side:<br>
1. User B Receives the CC Message and if the User-User information is present in the CC message it is displayed to the user.<br>
The primary advantages of the present invention are: (i) the caller will at least know why the called party is not responding and (ii) the called party in silent mode will tend to miss fewer calls if not none.<br>
It will also be obvious to those skilled in the art that other control methods and apparatuses can be derived from the combinations of the various methods and apparatuses of the present invention as taught by the description and the accompanying drawings and these shall also be considered within the scope of the present invention. Further, description of such combinations and variations is therefore omitted above. It should also be noted that the host for storing the applications include but not limited to a microchip, microprocessor, handheld communication device, computer, rendering device or a multi function device.<br>
Although the present invention has been fully described in connection with the preferred embodiments thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications are possible and are apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications are to be understood as included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims unless they depart therefrom.<br><br>
