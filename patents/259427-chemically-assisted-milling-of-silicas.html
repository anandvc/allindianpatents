				<td>CHEMICALLY ASSISTED MILLING OF SILICAS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] This invention relates to stable dispersions of porous inorganic oxide particles having a high solids content. The invention also relates to methods of making these dispersions.<br>
[0002] Fine sized inorganic oxide particles are well known. For example, "colloidal silicas" are well known and typically have median particle sizes (diameters) of 0.1 microns (100 nanometers) or less. See, for example, Canadian Patents 609,186 and 609,190; and U.S. Patent 3,012,973. Colloidal silica in a dispersed, non-aggregated state is not porous, and any surface area present in these particles is on the external surface of the primary, non-aggregated particles, i.e., there is no surface area provided by internal porosity in the particles.<br>
[0003] Dispersions of relatively small silica gel particles known as "silica microgels" are disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,954,220. Silica microgel particle dispersions are prepared by reacting alkali metal silicates and acid under conditions to initiate the coalescence and gelling of primary particles. The conditions, however, are also selected so that the gelled particles only grow to small, e.g., submicron, sizes. The dispersion in which microgel particles are prepared is not processed to the point that the coalescing particles form a rigid macrogel. Microgels are typically prepared from sol dispersions having less than 10%, and more typically less than one percent by weight solids. [0004] European Patent Application 468,070 discloses preparing a dispersion of gel particles having particle sizes in the range of 1 to 50 microns, preferably in the range of 10-30 microns, by wet milling larger gel particles. The particles resulting from the wet milling are reported to have surface areas ranging from 50 to 700 m2/g and pore volumes of 0.3 to 2 cc per gram. The wet milled particles are then spray dried to make larger spherical particles in the range of 1 to 200 microns, preferably 30-100 microns. This patent discloses using the spray dried particles as carriers for polyolefin catalysts and that the larger spherical particles in the range of 30-100 microns are preferable.<br>
[0005] U.S. Patent 5,030,286 discloses high solids content dispersions, e.g., from 40 to about 55% by weight, of precipitated silica. The precipitated silicas illustrating the dispersions of this patent have average particle sizes greater than one micron. The dispersions are prepared by milling the precipitated silica. It is reported in the *286 patent that milling the precipitated silica results in a less viscous dispersion and allows the dispersions to be used at high solids concentrations. The '286 patent discloses that these high concentration dispersions can be used in paper coatings.<br>
[0006] European Patent Application 803 374 discloses using agglomerated silica particles having average particle sizes of 10-300 nm in ink receptive layers for ink jet paper. It is disclosed that these particles are prepared from grinding larger particles, e.g., having sizes<br>
Of 9{JL.<br>
[0007] A copending application having Serial No. 878,476 filed on June 19, 1997, discloses wet milling inorganic oxide gels to obtain average particle sizes of 3 to 6 microns. This patent application discloses that any particles below 1 micron are present at a maximum amount of 40 percent by weight. The particles described in this application are then spray dried to form catalyst supports.<br>
[0008] U.S. Patent 4,983,369 discloses a dispersion of dense spherical particles having average particle sizes of 0.1 to 10 microns. The '369 patent also discloses that the spherical particles can be either nonporous or porous. The '369 patent also discloses that the porosity of the porous particles is reduced when contacted with water. The porous particles made by the process described in the '369 patent have particle sizes greater than one micron.<br>
[0009] U. S. Patent 5,277,888 discloses using organic dispersing medium to make stable dispersions of particles having average sizes in the range of 0.05 to 10 microns. The patent illustrates the dispersion with dense non-porous silica particles. [0010] U.S. Patent 2,731,326 discloses aggregates of dense, low porosity silica spheroids wherein the aggregates are described as supercolloidal, i.e., larger than 100 millimicrons (0.1 micron). These aggregated particles have primary particle sizes greater than 15 nanometers and are described as having a size such that they appear as a precipitate when they are prepared in dispersion.<br>
[0011] U.S. Patent 2,741,600 discloses preparing dispersions of silica having average particle sizes below 1 micron, e.g., of between 0,1 and 0.5 microns. The dispersions disclosed in the '600 patent are produced by milling autoclaved silica gels. The material resulting from the autoclaving step is described as possessing two phases, i.e., an aquasol phase and a "mud" phase. The mud phase is milled to form a dispersion described as having a milky white appearance. The two phases can be used separately, or as a combination. Porosity of the milled mud phase or the aquasol phase produced during autoclaving is not reported nor described in this patent.<br>
[0012] Ber's "Chemistry of Silica", pages 328-330, (1979) discloses porous silica sols which are prepared through various procedures. The porous silica sols described in Der's treatise range in size from 0.1 to 0.3 microns. In general, these submicron sized particles are prepared by aggregation of smaller particles. The surface areas of the particles produced are reported to be in the range of 22 m2/g to over 700 m2/g, depending on the methodology used to prepare the particles. For example, U.S. Patent 3,607,774 referred to by Her discloses silica sols of 0.5 microns or greater, e.g., up to about 1.5 microns. The '774 patent reports making sols having surface areas of about 103 m2/g or less. Another patent referred to by Her, i.e., U.S. Patent 3,591,518 discloses porous silica sols making particle sizes of about 0.2 microns and external surface areas in the range of 17-900 m2/g. Pore sizes, pore volume and pore volume stability for the particulates of the two aforementioned patents are not reported.<br>
[0013] WO 97/22670 discloses precipitated silicates and slurries prepared by destructuring aluminum silicate and silica via dry milling and then formulating slurries by addition of water. Slurries comprising the destructured materials have reduced viscosities compared to slurries of unmilled silica at equal solids content Those slurries also have reduced DPS values. The median particle size for these particles is significantly greater than one micron.<br>
[0014] German Patent No. DE 19534327 to Koch describes a paniculate dispersion containing particles, binder and a dispersant. The components are merely admixed to form the coating mixture.<br>
[0015] U.S. Patent No. 5,720,806 to Tokuyama relates to micronized silica powder that contains at least 0.3-1.0% by weight of alumina oxide. The aluminum oxide is incorporated in the silica during formation of the particle. [0016] U.S. Patent No. 2,892,797, to Alexander, describe treating a colloidal silica aquasol in which the silica particles have an average size from 3 to 150 millimicrons by adding to it an aqueous solution of, e.g., sodium aluminate. However, the silica particles in this invention do not contain internal porosity, and there is no reference to the improved solids/viscosity relationship claimed for the present invention. [0017] U.S. Patents Nos. 6,420,456 Bl; 6,312,861 Bl; 6,214,106 Bl; 6,096,469; 4,877,451; 5,376,172; Re. 30,450; and 4,263,051 describe silica materials wherein silica particles are coated with a organic silane compounds.<br>
[0018] U.S. Patent No. 6,415,996 Bl to Adair et al. relates to a method of chemically assisted milling of ceramic powders. The pH of the dispersion is continuously monitored and passivating agent added in order to prepare particles that possess smooth surfaces. [0019] There are also patent applications for fumed silica doped with alumina, e.g., U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 20010042493 Al to Degussa. Silica made cationic with aluminum chlorohydrol is the subject of DE Patent Application No. 95 34 327 Al. U.S. Patent Application Publication No.2002/0040661 Al describes aminopropylsilane treated fumed and precipitated silica. U.S. Patent No. 6,420,039 Bl to Cabot describes a cationic alumina coating on fumed silica. U.S. Patent No. 5,472,473, to Cabot, describes fumed silica having a surface modified with a quaternary salt. As indicated above, a dispersion of particles can be used to form porous structures, e.g., ink receptive coatings for paper. It is desirable if the porosity in such coatings not only provides a means for increasing the rate of ink absorption for certain paper coatings, but also provides for relatively high ink capacity in order to retain high resolution images. [0020] However, a significant problem involved with dispersions containing porous particles relates to loading capacity. Due to the very nature of the porous particles, as the solids content or loading of the particulate in the dispersion increases, the viscosity also increases at an exponential rate. Additionally, porous particulate dispersions are typically<br>
unstable. To complicate matters further, most coating applications require dispersions to be above 20% solids.<br>
[0021] All of the above-mentioned documents describe porous particulate dispersions that try to ameliorate problems with low concentration and poor stability by adding certain dispersion aids to the milled product. Even though these dispersion aids have yielded improved loading capacities and stability, there remains a need for even further improvements in loading capacity and stability of porous particulate dispersions.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0022] The present invention relates to a dispersion of porous surface modified anionic silica particles comprising fluid, and the surface modified anionic silica particles; wherein the maximum fractional occupied volume ($) of the particles in the dispersion is at least about 0.55 as determined from the relationship<br>
wherein O is the fractional occupied volume of the solids in the fluid, t&amp;maxis the asymptotic limit of fractional occupied volume as the viscosity approaches infinity, b is the intrinsic viscosity, no is the viscosity of the fluid/solvent and T| is the viscosity of the dispersion.<br>
[0023] Another embodiment of the present invention pertains to a formulation that includes the porous inorganic oxide particles as described above used in combination with a binder and optional additives, wherein the formulation can be used to provide a coating on a substrate.<br>
[0024] A further embodiment of the present invention relates to a coated substrate comprising a substrate and at least one layer thereon including the formulation set forth above.<br>
[0025] An even further embodiment of the present invention relates to a method of preparing a dispersion of particles including forming a slurry of inorganic oxide particles and milling the slurry to form the dispersion of particles wherein the slurry includes a<br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS<br>
[0026] FIG. 1 and FIG. 3 are graphical representations of the viscosity versus percent solids for dispersions of the present invention with respect to comparative dispersions. [0027] FIG. 2 and FIG. 4 are graphical representations of the viscosity versus the fractional occupied volume for dispersions of the present invention with respect to comparative dispersions.<br>
DETAHJED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS [0028] The inorganic oxide particles of the subject invention provide dispersions possessing high particle or solids concentrations with low viscosities and improved stability compared to particle dispersions prepared by conventional methods. [0029] The present invention relates to a dispersion of porous, anionic, sub-micron inorganic oxide particles, (i.e., including a fluid and the porous, anionic inorganic oxide particles) wherein the particles have been surface modified, and as a result exhibit an improved viscosity versus percent solids relationship and an improved viscosity versus fractional occupied volume relationship when compared to unmodified materials.   The porosity (or total pore volume) of the particles is typically measured either before preparation of the dispersion or after the final dispersion has been dried, by means of nitrogen porosimetry. A more direct measure of the porosity of the particles in the dispersion (referred to as the apparent pore volume, PVa) can be obtained using a viscosity-derived method (as described in U.S. Patent No. 6,380,265). The relationship between viscosity and maximum occupied volume is given by the relationship:<br>
wherein O is the fractional occupied volume of the solids in the fluid, O^is the asymptotic limit of fractional occupied volume as the viscosity approaches infinity, b is the intrinsic viscosity, rjD is the viscosity of the fluid/solvent and i\ is the viscosity of the dispersion.<br>
[0030] The apparent porosity of the inorganic particles of the present invention is about 0.5 cmVg or greater, preferably greater than about 0.8 cmVg, and more preferably greater than about 1.1 cmVg up to 3.0 cmVg or more. Further, a parameter that relates to the viscosity of the dispersions of the present particles, the maximum fractional occupied volume (<dmax is determined to be at least about preferably and more up or more. the intrinsic viscosity b between anionic nature of inorganic particles can by zeta potential measured on particle dispersions present invention less than zero negative size in dispersion characterized measurement using a method such as dynamic static light scattering. one parameter obtained this dso median volume typically microns for invention.></dmax><br>
f 1) Parent Inorganic Oxide Particles<br>
[0032] Inorganic oxides suitable for preparing the dispersion include porous precipitated<br>
inorganic oxides, inorganic oxide gels and fumed oxides. These inorganic oxides are<br>
referred to herein as "parent inorganic oxides," "parent particles" or "parent dispersions".<br>
Amorphous precipitated silica, silica gels and fumed silica are particularly suitable parent<br>
inorganic oxides.<br>
[0033] In embodiments comprising gels, the dispersions are derived from porous<br>
inorganic oxide gels such as, but not limited to, gels comprising SiO2, The gels can be<br>
hydrogels, aerogels, or xerogels. A hydrogel is also known as an aquagel which is formed<br>
in water and as a result its pores are filled with water. A xerogel is a hydrogel with the<br>
water removed. An aerogel is a type of xerogel from which the liquid has been removed in such a way as to minimize any collapse or change in the gel's structure as the water is removed. Silica gels commercially available as Syloid® grade gels, e.g., grades 74, 221, 234,244, W300, and Genesis™ silica gels are suitable parent inorganic oxides. [0034] Gels are well known in the art. See fler's "The Chemistry of Silica", p. 462 (1979). Gel, e.g. silica gel, particles are distinguishable from colloidal silica or precipitated silica particles. For example, colloidal silica is prepared as a slurry of dense, non-porous silica particles, Colloidal silica particles typically are smaller than 200nm (0.2 micron). As mentioned earlier, these particles do not have internal porosity. On the other hand, typical dispersed precipitated particles have some internal porosity. In some cases, the internal porosity in typically precipitated particles, however, largely collapse under capillary pressure created by receding menisci of water as the water evaporates during drying. The conditions for making colloidal silica and precipitated silica are well known.<br>
[0035] Gels, on the other hand, are prepared under conditions which promote coalescence of primary particles (typically having median particles sizes of 1 to 10 nm, as measured under transmission electron microscopy, i.e., TEM) to form a relatively rigid three dimensional network. The coalescence of gel is exhibited on a macroscale when a dispersion of inorganic oxide, e.g., silica, hardens to a "gel" or "gelled" mass having structural integrity.<br>
[0036] Methods of preparing inorganic oxide gels are well known in the art. For example, a silica gel is prepared by mixing an aqueous solution of an alkali metal silicate (e.g., sodium silicate) with a strong acid such as nitric or sulfuric acid, the mixing being done under suitable conditions of agitation to form a clear silica sol which sets into a hydrogel, i.e., macrogel, in less than about one-half hour. The resulting gel is then washed. The concentration of inorganic oxide, i.e., SiO^, formed in the hydrogel is usually in the range of about 10 and about 50, preferably between about 20 and about 35, and most preferably between about 30 and about 35 weight percent, with the pH of that gel being from about 1 to about 9, preferably 1 to about 4. A wide range of mixing temperatures can be employed, this range being typically from about 20 to about 50°C.<br>
[0037] The newly formed hydrogels are washed simply by immersion in a continuously moving stream of water, which leaches out the undesirable salts, leaving about 99.5 weight percent or more pure inorganic oxide behind.<br>
[0038] The pH, temperature, and duration of the wash water will influence the physical properties of the silica, such as surface area (SA) and pore volume (PV). Silica gel washed at 65-90°C at pH's of 8-9 for 15-36 hours will usually have SA's of 250-400 and form aerogels with PV's of 1.4 to 1.7 cc/gm. Silica gel washed at pH's of 3-5 at 50-65°C for 15-25 hours will have SA's of 700-850 and form aerogels with PV's of 0.6-1.3. These measurements are generated by the well known Na porosity method. [0039] Reinforced precipitated silica such as that described in U.S. Patent 4,157,920 can also be used to prepare the dispersion of this invention. The contents of that patent are incorporated herein by reference. For example, reinforced precipitated silicas can be prepared by first acidulating an alkali inorganic silicate to create an initial precipitate. The resulting precipitate is then reinforced or "post conditioned" by additional silicate and acid. The precipitate resulting from the second addition of silicate and acid comprises 10 to 70% by weight of the precipitate initially prepared. It is believed that the reinforced structure of this precipitate is more rigid than conventional precipitates as a result of the second precipitation. It is believed that even after milling, centrifuging and subsequent drying, the reinforced silicate substantially maintains its network rigidity and porosity. This is in contrast to other precipitated silicas such as those disclosed in U.S. Patent 5,030,286.<br>
[0040] In another embodiment, the inorganic oxide comprises fumed silica. Fumed silica may be fabricated using the processes described in DE 762723. Production of fumed silica is also discussed in Ullmann's Encyclopaedia of Industrial Chemistry, Vol. A23, 1993, Chapter 6.<br>
[0041] Once an inorganic oxide is selected for the parent dispersion, a liquid phase of the selected inorganic oxide is prepared. The fluid for the liquid phase can be aqueous or organic. The liquid phase can be residual water in inorganic oxide gels which have been drained, but not yet dried, and to which additional water is added to reslurry the gel. In another embodiment, dried inorganic oxides, e.g., xerogels, are dispersed in liquid<br>
medium. In general, the parent dispersion should be in a state that can be wet milled. In most embodiments, the parent dispersion has a median particle size approximately in the range of 5 to 40 microns. However, the size of the parent particles only needs to be sufficient such that the mill being used can produce a dispersion having the desired median particle size at about or below 3 microns. In embodiments prepared from a drained inorganic oxide gel, the drained gel may first be broken up into gel chunks and premilled to produce a dispersion of particles in the range of 5 to 40 microns.<br>
(2) Milling<br>
[0042] The parent dispersion is then milled. The milling is conducted "wet", i.e., in liquid media. The general milling conditions can vary depending on the feed material, residence time, impeller speeds, and milling media particle size. Suitable conditions and residence times are described in the Examples. These conditions can be varied to obtain the desired size within the range of 0.05 to about 3 microns. The techniques for selecting and modifying these conditions to obtain the desired dispersions are known to those skilled in the art.<br>
[0043] The milling equipment used to mill the parent inorganic oxide particles should be of the type capable of severely milling and reducing materials to particles having sizes about three microns or smaller, particularly below one micron, e.g., through mechanical action. Such mills are commercially available, with hammer and sand mills being particularly suitable for this purpose. Hammer mills impart the necessary mechanical action through high speed metal blades, and sand mills impart the action through rapidly churning media such as zirconia or sand beads. Impact mills can also be used. Both impact mills and hammer mills reduce particle size by impact of the inorganic oxide with metal blades. A dispersion comprising particles of three microns or smaller is then recovered as the final product.<br>
[0044] Preferably, the milling process is conducted utilizing a chemical agent in admixture with inorganic oxide particles. The process provides surface modification of the particles as they are milled. For example, the parent silica dispersions of the above description are then surface modified during milling with a water-soluble metalate of an<br>
amphoteric metal which forms an insoluble silicate at a pH between 5 and 12. In principle, metals that could be used include aluminum, tin, zinc and lead, with aluminum being the most preferred of these. The metals can be added in alkaline solution in the form of an alkali metalate such as sodium, potassium, tetramethylammonium, or lithium aluminate, stannate, zincate or plumbite. Stable, water soluble metalate salts like sodium aluminate and sodium stannate, which can be readily dissolved to form relatively stable aqueous solutions in the absence of excess alkali are preferred treating agents. An example of such a metalate is sodium aluminate, NaAlO2. The amount of metalate used to modify the surface depends on the particular application, but typically ranges from 0.5% (w/w silica) to 5% (w/w silica). Ideally, for the modified silica to retain a negative change and hence negative zeta potential, the aluminate should be added at high pH and under conditions that minimize the self-polymerization of the alumina. Hence, a recommended procedure is to first dissolve the aluminate in a dilute solution of deionized water, followed by addition of the parent silica precursor which is to be milled to small particle size. In this fashion, the aluminate reacts initially only with the surface of the silica. This is in contrast to the art disclosed in U.S. 5,720,806, wherein an alumina source is added to the silica as the latter is being synthesized. It is believed that the alumina in this case is dispersed throughout the entire silica network, and is not just available at the surface for surface modification.<br>
[0045] Furthermore, in the milling process of the present invention, unreacted aluminated is present in the dispersion as it is milled, notably as the particles are fractured during milling. It is believed that the metalate ions become chemically bound to the silica surface, and that this surface modification lowers the viscosity of the djspersion such that higher solids loadings can be obtained.<br>
[0046] The cation of the metalate salt is a reaction product once the metalate has bonded with the oxide surface, and if desired, this cation can be partly or entirely replaced with other suitable cations such as protons or other alkali metal cations by means of ion-exchange. Cation exchange resins and methods are well known to those versed in this art.<br>
[0047] The milled dispersion may also be further processed. For example, further processing is desirable if there is a significant population of particles larger than three microns after milling. Further processing may also be needed to insure that essentially all of the distribution of particles is below about two microns and especially when dispersions in the size range of 1 micron or less is desired. In such a case, the milled dispersion is processed to separate the dispersion into a supernatant phase, which comprises the particles of the final product, and a settled phase which comprises the larger particles. The separation can be created by centrifuging the milled inorganic oxide particles. The supernatant phase is then removed from the settled phase, e.g., by decanting. The supernatant is the dispersion of this invention. Conventional centrifuges can be used for this phase separation.   In some instances, it may be preferable to centrifuge the supernatant two, three or more tunes to further remove large particles remaining after the initial centrifuge. It is also contemplated that the larger particles of a milled dispersion can separate over time under normal gravity conditions, and the supernatant can be removed by decanting.<br>
[0048] Depending:on the.product particle size targets, the settled phase also can be regarded as the particles of this invention. For example, if a dispersion of larger particles within the range of 0.05 to 3 microns is desired, the settled phase can be removed and redispersed. In such instances, the parent dispersion may need to be milled more than once to insure that the settled phase has the appropriate particle size in the range of 0.05 to 3 microns.<br>
[0049] The dispersion of particles also can be modified after milling to insure a stable dispersion. This can be accomplished through pH adjustment, e.g., adding alkaline material, or by the addition of conventional dispersants.<br>
[0050] The dispersion of particles can also be modified after milling to increase the solids content of the slurry, such as by ultrafiltration or evaporation of the solvent/fluid. In ultrafiltration, the slurry is passed over a membrane which has pores that are permeable to the fluid phase but not to the inorganic oxide phase. The mixture is then separated into a fluid rich permeate phase and a higher solids retentate phase.<br>
f3) Inorganic Oxide Dispersion<br>
[0051] As indicated earlier, the median particle size, i.e., particle diameter, of the particles in the dispersion is in the range of 0.05 to about 3 microns, The size is primarily dictated by the dispersion's use and can be in ranges of, e.g., between 0.06 to 2.9, 0.07 to 2.8, and so on. For example, if the dispersion is ultimately to be an ingredient in a coating formulation for high gloss ink-jet media, the dispersion should have a median particle size below 0.5 micron, and preferably in the range of 0.1 and 0.3 micron. The median particle size is measured using conventional light scattering instrumentation and methods. The sizes reported in the Examples were determined by a LA900 laser scattering particle size analyzer from Horiba Instruments, Inc. [0052] The solids content of the dispersion varies and depends on the solids content of the feed particle dispersion as well as on the porosity of the solid phase. The solids content of the dispersion is generally in the range of 1-50% by weight, preferably 10-45% and more preferably 15-40% and all ranges in between, although in certain applications, the amount can be higher or lower.<br>
[0053] In general, the dispersion's viscosity should be such that the dispersion is a pumpable liquid. The viscosity of the dispersion is highly dependent upon the dispersion's solids content and the porosity of the particles. Viscosity enhancers and agents can also be used to modify the dispersion's viscosity to fit particular applications. The viscosity can range from 1 to over 10,000 centiposes (cp) as measured by a Brookfield viscometer, e.g., operated at a shear rate of 73.4 sec"1. In most embodiments, the viscosity is below 100 cp.<br>
[0054] In order to unambiguously associate the benefit in viscosity versus solids to the surface modification treatment, it is necessary to consider the following. [0055] First, the theoretical basis for the relationship between viscosity particle volume fraction is given by the Krieger-Dougherty Equation, as described in the text by P. C. Hiemenz and R. Rajagopalan, "Principles of Colloid and Surface Chemistry", 3rd ed., Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York (1997), p. 169. This relationship is given as<br>
wherein «t» is the fractional occupied volume of the solids in the fluid, ^^is the asymptotic limit of fractional occupied volume as the viscosity approaches infinity, b is the intrinsic viscosity, tjo is the viscosity of the fluid/solvent and r\ is the viscosity of the dispersion.<br>
[0056] This equation gives the viscosity of the suspension of particles as a function of the volume fraction occupied by the particles in the suspension. It is typical in the literature to report the viscosity of a dispersion as a function of the mass loading of the dispersion solids. Furthermore, in the present case, the particles are porous. Compared to less porous particles (at the same mass loading in a solvent), porous particles occupy a greater volume fraction of the solvent-particle system and, as such, they to a greater extent disrupt and offer greater resistance to shear flow of the fluid. In order to take explicit account of this effect of particle porosity on viscosity, the mass loading (% solids) must be converted to fractional volume. The expression that relates mass loading to volume loading as a function of particle pore volume is given in the equation below:<br>
O = Kl/p, + PVJ pf x][l-x(l-p,/Ps)]<br>
x is mass loading<br>
ps is particle skeletal density<br>
pf is fluid density<br>
PVa is particle pore volume (apparent)<br>
[0057] Thus, in order to demonstrate the relationship between viscosity and fractional<br>
occupied volume, the pore volume of the particles must be known. In order to show that<br>
there is an intrinsic benefit of the surface modification on viscosity, it is necessary to<br>
include the effect of particle pore volume. The method of measuring PVa is given in<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,380,265.<br>
[0058] The pH of the dispersion depends upon the inorganic oxide and additives used to<br>
stabilize the dispersion. The pH can be in the range of 2 to 11, and all ranges in between.<br>
Stable silica dispersions with negative zeta potential are generally moderately alkaline,<br>
e.g., pH 8 to 11.<br>
[0059] The pH can also be modified using conventional pH modifiers.<br>
[0060] With respect to embodiments comprising silica gel, the dispersion is relatively free of impurities when compared to embodiments comprising, for example, precipitated inorganic oxide particles. Parent silica gels are typically washed to remove substantially all impurities. The alkali salt content of gels are typically as low as 100 ppm by weight and generally no more than 0.1% based on the weight of gel. The low impurity levels of silica gels are especially advantageous when colloidally stable dispersions of particles are desired.<br>
[0061] The dispersion of this invention also is stable. By "stable dispersion" is meant a dispersion of fine particles which remain in suspension for long periods of time, and do not show evidence of particle agglomeration. The stability of a particle dispersion depends on a number of factors, including particle size, particle charge, porosity, particle density, and pH of the dispersion. These factors can vary and depend on how the dispersion is made. Conventional dispersants can be used for this purpose. As described earlier, "in situ" stable dispersions of particles also can be prepared by milling particles in the presence of a surface modifier, and recovering particles having a median particle size below one micron, preferably in the range of 0.01 to about 0.5 micron. Embodiments comprising particles prepared by this process generally have median particle sizes less than one micron.<br>
[0062] The dispersion of this invention is suitable for many applications, and more particularly suitable for applications which benefit from porous particles having fine particle sizes. It has been found, for example, that the invention is well suited for ink receptive coatings. A high degree of porosity in a paper coating contributes to fast ink drytimes, minimal ink spreading (dot gain), good image resolution, high capacity for high ink-loads (such as for photorealistic ink-jet printing) and exceptional ink color gamut. [0063] Ink-receptive coating formulations typically contain an inorganic pigment such as inorganic oxide (e.g., silica gel), a binder and additives such as dye mordents, etc. The particles of this invention can be used as the inorganic pigment. Ink-receptive coatings prepared using particles of this dispersion are highly porous, which contributes to high porosity in the coating. A further advantage of the dispersions of the present invention is that the high solids dispersions enable high solids coating formulations to be prepared.<br>
High solids coating formulations are desirable since coating line speeds are often limited<br>
by the amount of drying capacity on the coating line, and higher solids formulation<br>
contain less solvent that must be removed during the drying step. Hence, high solids<br>
formulations enable high line speeds to be attained, which lowers production costs,<br>
Another advantage of the high solids dispersion is that it enables the coating formulator<br>
more flexibility in the choice of other formulation materials, such as binders. For<br>
example, a lower solids binder might be acceptable when used with the high solids<br>
dispersions of the present invention since the combined formulation solids is greater in<br>
the latter case. It should be remembered, of course, that the object of the present<br>
invention is to provide high solids dispersions and formulations with high intrinsic<br>
particle porosity, which can be achieved by using the surface modifiers of the present<br>
invention.<br>
[0064] The surface modification of the particles in the dispersions according to the<br>
present invention provides an increase in the maximum fractional occupied volume (A<t>)<br>
of the solids/particles in the fluid of at least about 0.05, preferably, at least about 0.08,<br>
and more preferably, at least about 0.14.<br>
[0065] The dispersion of this invention can be directly used as a coating composition as<br>
is. It is preferable for most applications, however, that the dispersion be combined with a<br>
binder and any other coating additives a paper manufacturer requires. As mentioned<br>
earlier, the solids content, pH and viscosity of the dispersion can be tailored to meet the<br>
specifications of the paper being coated.<br>
[0066] Other uses for this invention include binders (e.g., for catalysts), fillers, cardboard<br>
stiffeners, rheological agents, abrasive additives in dentifrice compositions, corrosion<br>
inhibitors, leather treating agents, insulation coatings, cosmetic additives, fiber coatings,<br>
and the like.<br>

[0070] This example demonstrates the preparation of a high solids, low viscosity dispersion by wet-milling a silica gel material in the presence of a surface modifier. First, a 3 % w/w solution of NaAlC2 surface modifier (from EM Scientific) is prepared by adding the appropriate amount of NaAJO to deionized water. A parent silica slurry is then prepared in the following proportions: 410 g of the 3 wt% NaAlOi solution is added to 1230 g deionized water. To this solution is added 2731 g (hydrous basis; 45% solids) of Syloid™ W500. With these proportions, the concentration of surface modifier (AOs) is 1 % (w/w SiOa). The pore volume of the Syloid™ W500, measured by nitrogen proximity after vacuum activation (and removal of the pore water) is 1.20 cnvVg. This suspension is then wet-milled using a Netzsch Lab Star media mill and 0.4 - 0.7 mm SEPR media, with a flow rate of about 0.7 L/min for a total time of 180 min. After milling, the pH of the dispersion is 8.04, the median particle size (D50) is 0.29 microns, and the dispersion solids are 30.4%. The zeta potential measured for this dispersion is -47.1 mV.

[0073] It can be seen in Figure 1 that Example 1 prepared according to the present invention has significantly lower viscosity at constant solids when compared to the comparative examples prepared without the surface modification. Furthermore, when the effect of the porous nature of the particles is taken into account by determining the fractional occupied volumes of the suspensions, it can be seen in Figure 2 that the dispersion prepared according to Example 1 still displays much lower viscosity than the dispersions prepared without surface modification.<br>

A parent silica slurry is then prepared by adding 1116.4 g of Degussa Aerosil A200. With these proportions, the concentration of surface modifier (AhOs) is 2 % (w/w Si02&gt;. This suspension is then wet-milled using a Netzsch LabStar media mill and 0.4 -0.7 mm SEPR media, with a flow rate of about 0.7 L/min for a total time of 200 min. After milling, the pH of the dispersion is 7.8, the median particle size (D50) is 0.16 microns, and the dispersion solids are 24.6%. A portion of the dispersion is dried, and<br>

The viscosity-derived apparent pore volume, PVa, is determined according to the method disclosed in U. S. Patent No. 6,380,265. The result is 2.31 cnrVg. The apparent pore volume is used to convert the mass loading of Figure 3 into the fractional occupied volume loading, as shown in Figure 4. This data is then fitted to equation I, and the fitted parameters are On** = 0.74 with b = 2.7.<br>
Comparative Example 2<br>

[0075] This example demonstrates the preparation of a high solids, low viscosity dispersion by wet-milling a fumed silica material in the absence of the surface modifier. To 3467 g deionized water is added 694 g of Degussa Aerosil A200, and the pH is adjusted up by the simultaneous addition of aqueous ammonia. This suspension is then wet-milled using a Netzsch LabStar media mill and 0.4 - 0.7 mm SEPR media, with a flow rate of about 0.7 L/min for a total time of 60 min. After milling, the pH of the dispersion is 8.68, the median particle size (D50) is 0.19 microns, and the dispersion solids are 16.9%. A portion of the dispersion is dried, and the pore volume of the dried dispersion, measured by nitrogen porosimetry, is 1.02 cm3/g. A plot of the viscosity versus solids relationship for this dispersion is given in Figure 3. The viscosity-derived apparent pore volume, PVa, is determined according to the method disclosed in U.

[0076] It can be seen in Figure 3 that Example 2 prepared according to the present invention has lower viscosity at high solids when compared to the comparative example prepared without the surface modification. Furthermore, when the effect of the porous<br>
nature of the particles is taken into account by determining the fractional occupied volumes of the suspensions, it can be seen in Figure 4 that the dispersion prepared according to Example 2 displays dramatically lower viscosity than the dispersion prepared without surface modification.<br>
Comparative Example 3<br>
Preparation of Large Sized Alumina Modified Silica<br>
[0077] U.S. Patent No. 5,720,806 describes an alumina-modified silica composition for ink-jet applications. A sample of commercial material (Finesil X37B from Tokuyama Corporation) believed to be an embodiment of the Claims of the above patent is obtained and analyzed. The chemical composition is determined to be 0.78 wt% A12O3; 0.50 wt% Na2O, balance SiO2. Hence, this produce has a similar chemical composition to those in U.S. Patent No. 5,720,806. The particle of the material is measured, and the D50 is 7.4 microns. A plot of the viscosity versus solids relationship for this dispersion is given in Figure 1. The apparent pore volume for this material dispersed in water is measured according to the method above, and is determined to be 2.25 cm3/g. The apparent pore volume is used to convert the mass loading of Figure 1 into the fractional occupied volume loading, as shown in Figure 2. This data is then fitted to equation (I), and the fitted parameters are 
[0078] It can be seen in Figures 1 and 2 that the material prepared in accordance with U.S. Patent No. 5,720,806 has higher viscosity at constant solids and at constant fractional occupied volume when compared to the Examples of the present invention. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that the reason that this material does not show the expected benefit in viscosity associated with presence of sodium aluminate is that the aluminate is distributed throughout the particle by virtue of the synthesis procedure, rather than at the particle surface as for the present invention.<br>
Comparative Example 4<br>

The apparent pore volume for this dispersion is measured according to the method above, and is determined to be 0.39 cm3/g, A portion of the dispersion is dried, and the pore volume of the dried dispersion, measured by nitrogen porosimetry, is 0.23 cm3/g. This material clearly does not have any significant porosity compared to the present invention and would not be suitable for ink adsorption. [0080] Table 1 summarizes the properties of the previous examples. It is readily apparent that the dispersions according to the present invention possess superior loading capacities of porous particulates as evidenced by their higher 9am values.<br>

The total solids content of this mixture is 17-1 wt%, and the ratio of silica:PVOH is 3:1 on a solids basis. The mixture is coated onto a plastic PET film (Mellinex 534 from ICI), and is dried at 130 C for 1 min. The final coat weight is 20.1 g/m2. Test patterns are printed onto the coated sheets using commercially available, narrow format ink-jet printers (EPSON C80; EPSON 880; Hewlett-Packard-970; EPSON 870). The uniformity of the unprinted coating is noted, and the appearance of the printed test patterns is given a rating in from 1 to 4(1= very good; 2 = good; 3 = poor; 4 = very poor). Results are shown in Table 2.<br>

[0082] A coating formulation consisting of silica and binder is prepared by mixing materials in the following proportions. 250 g of the surface-modified silica gel prepared according to Example 1 at 30.0 \vt% solids is mixed with 161 g of a solution of 15.5 wt% polyvinylalcohol (CelVol 523 from Celanese). No additional deionized water is added. The total solids content of<br>
this mixture is 24.3 wt%, and the ratio of silica:PVOH is 3:1 on a solids basis. The mixture is coated onto a plastic PET film (Mellinex 534 from ICI), and is dried at 130 C for 1 min. The final coat weight is 25.9 g/m2. Test patterns are printed onto the coated sheets using commercially available, narrow format ink-jet printers (EPSON C80; EPSON 880; Hewlett-Packard-970; EPSON 870). The uniformity of the imprinted coating is noted, and the appearance of the printed test patterns is given a rating in from 1 to 4 (1 = very good; 2 = good; 3 = poor; 4 = very poor). Results are shown in Table 2.<br>
Comparative Example 5<br>
Preparation of a coating formulation with sub-micron silica gel dispersion without surface modification<br>
[0083] A coating formulation consisting of silica and binder is prepared by mixing materials in the following proportions. 375 g of the surface-modified silica gel prepared according to Comparative Example 1A at 20 wt% solids is mixed with 161 g of a solution of 15.5 wt% polyvinylalcohol (CelVol 523 from Celanese). An additional 50 g of deionized water is added. The total solids content of this mixture is 17.1 wt%, and the ratio of silica:PVOH was 3:1 on a solids basis. The mixture is coated onto a plastic PET film (Mellinex 534 from ICI), and is dried at 130 C for 1 min. The final coat weight is 20.1 g/m2. Test patterns are printed onto the coated sheets using commercially available, narrow format ink-jet printers (EPSON CSO; EPSON 880; Hewlett-Packard-970; EPSON 870). The uniformity of the unprinted coating is noted, and the appearance of the printed test patterns is given a rating in from 1 to 4 (1 = very good; 2 = good; 3 = poor; 4 = very poor). Results are shown in Table 2.<br>
 [0084] It can be seen that when the coated substrates are compared at constant coat weight, the coating prepared using the dispersion of the present invention has better uniformity than that prepared without the surface modification. As a direct result of the higher solids and lower viscosity of the dispersion of the present invention, the coating formulation could be prepared at higher total solids, and hence a higher coat weight could be achieved in a single pass. When the higher coat weight media of the present invention is compared against that prepared without the surface modified dispersion, it is observed that the print quality is superior for the formulation of the present invention. These results are unexpected benefits of the silica surface modification.<br><br><br>
