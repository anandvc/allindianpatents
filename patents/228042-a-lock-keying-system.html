The spring catch 96 is disposed in the spring catch recess 108 of the carrier 90. A valid key 160 is inserted into the keyway 52, the return spring 98 is compressed into the return spring recess 112, and the carrier sub-assembly is placed adjacent the plug body 40, as Illustrated in FIG. 3. The plug assembly 14 is placed in the lock cylinder body 12 and the retainer 16 is disposed in the slots 66 formed in the plug body 40 to retain the plug assembly 14 in the cylinder body 12. The lock cylinder 10 is now keyed to the valid key 160.<br><br>
The property keyed lock cylinder 10, without the key 160 inserted, is illustrated in FIGS. 4-7. The pins 113 are biased to the bottom of the channels 74 and, based on the cut of the key 160, the racks 92 are disposed at various positions in the slots 102 of the carrier 90. In this configuration, the locking bar 94 extends from the carrier 90 to engage the groove 29 in the cylinder body 12 to prevent the plug assembly 14 from rotating in the cylinder body 12 and the racks 92 engage the pins 113, as illustrated in FIG. 4. In addition, the bullet-shaped features 78 are misaligned with the recesses 111 in the racks 92 and therefore interfere with movement of the racks 92 parallel to the longitudinal axis of the lock cylinder 10, preventing the lock cylinder 10 from being rekeyed.<br>
The internal configuration of a lock cylinder 10 with the valid key 160 inserted therein at the home position is illustrated in FIGS. 8-12. In this configuration, the locking bar 94 is free to cam out of the groove 29 in the cylinder body 12, as depicted in FIGS. 8, 9 and 12. The bits of the key 160 lift the pins 113 in the channels 74 and thereby re-position the racks 92 in the slots 102. When repositioned, the racks 92 are disposed to align the locking bar-engaging grooves 132 with the extended gear teeth 136 on the locking bar 94. The locking bar 94 is free to cam out of the groove 29 as the key 160 is rotated. At the same time, the bullet-shaped features 78 are aligned with the recesses 111 in the racks 92, as illustrated in FIG. 12, allowing the racks 92, and the carrier 90, to move parallel to the longitudinal axis of the lock cylinder 10.<br>
To rekey the lock cylinder 10, the valid key 160 is inserted into the keyway 52, as illustrated in FIGS. 13-14 and rotated approximately 45° counterclockwise from the home position until the spring catch 96 moves into the second detent recess 32 formed in the cylinder body 12. A paperclip or other pointed device 162 is inserted into the tool opening 54 and pushed against the carrier 90 to. move the carrier 90 parallel to the longitudinal axis of the lock cylinder 10 until the spring catch 96 moves into the first detent recess 30, and the pointed device 162 is removed. With the spring catch 96 disposed in the first detent recess 30, the racks 92 are disengaged from the pins 113, as illustrated in FIG. 14. The valid<br><br>
key 160 is removed and a second valid key is inserted and rotated clockwise to release the spring catch 96. As the spring catch 96 leaves the first detent recess 30, the earner 90 is biased toward the plug face 44 by the return spring 98, causing the racks 92 to re-engage the pins 113. At this point, the lock cylinder 10 is keyed to the second valid key and the first valid key 160 no longer operates tine lock cylinder 10. The lock cylinder 10 can be rekeyed to fit a third valid key by replacing the first and second valid keys in the above procedures with the second and third valid keys, respectively.<br>
An alternative embodiment 210 of an exemplary embodiment of the present invention is Illustrated in FIGS. 23-29. The alternative embodiment includes the same components, as illustrated in FIG. 23, but several of the components have been modified. Functionally, both embodiments are the same.<br>
The modified housing 212, illustrated in FIGS. 23 and 24, includes a plurality of apertures 214 running longitudinally along the bottom thereof and a pair of vertical grooves 216,218 formed in the housing sidewall. In addition, the sidewall includes a removable side panel 220. The rectangular holes 214 are positioned to allow the use of a manual override tool. The center groove 216 includes an aperture 222 extending through the housing sidewail. The aperture 222 allows a user to move the locking bar during a manual override operation. The side panel 220 provides access for performing certain operations while changing the master key of the lock cylinder.<br>
The modified pin biasing springs 226, illustrated in FIGS. 23 and 25, include a non-constant diameter, with the last few coils at each end of the springs 226 having a reduced diameter. The tapering allows for a greater spring force in a smaller physical height.<br>
The modified spring catch 228, illustrated in FIGS. 23 and 26, includes a central U-shaped portion 230 and a pair of arms 232 extending from the U-shaped portion 230.<br><br>
The modified carrier 236, illustrated in FIGS. 23 and 27, includes means for retaining the spring catch 228 in the spring catch recess 238. In the illustrated embodiment, this includes a guide 240 projecting outwardly in the center of the spring catch recess 238 and a pair, of anchors 242 radially offset from the guide 240. The guide 240 prevents the spring catch 228 from moving transversely in the recess 238 while permitting it to move radially outwardly to engage the housing 12,212 as described above. The anchors 242 engage the arms 232 of the spring catch 228 and prevent the amis 232 from splaying outwardly, thereby directing the compressive force of the spring catch 228 to extend the U-shaped portion 230 outwardly to engage the housing 12,212.<br>
The modified pins 244, illustrated in FIGS. 23 and 28, include a single gear tooth 246 instead of the plurality of gear teeth of the pins 113 described above. The single gear tooth 246, which preferably includes beveled sides 248, provides for a smoother engagement with the racks during the rekeying process.<br>
The modified racks 250, illustrated in FIGS. 23 and 29, include beveled gear teeth to improve the engagement with the pins during the rekeying process. In addition, the pair of locking bar-engaging grooves 132 in the racks 92 are replaced with a single locking bar-engaging groove 251.<br>
The modified locking bar 252, illustrated in FIGS. 23 and 30, is thinner than locking bar 94 and replaces the pair of gear teeth 136 with a single gear tooth 256 and rounds out the triangular edge 134. The thinner design reduces any rocking of the locking bar 252 in the locking bar recess 106.<br>
FIG. 31 is a perspective view of an exemplary embodiment of a manual override or rekeying tool 310, which can comprise a base 312 having, for example, a elongated approximately annular segment or elongated approximately toroidal segment shape. Attached to base 312 can be a plurality of prongs 314 each having, for example, an elongated approximately rectangular shape. Each of prongs 314 can be approximately perpendicularly attached to an inner surface 313 of base 312, and can have an end 316, that can have any<br><br>
shape that engages the a corresponding one of the plurality of racks 340 (shown in FIG. 34) of plug assembly 320, such as for example, a concave shape. To an outer surface 315 of base 312 can be attached a handle 318, having, for example, an elongated approximately rectangular shape. A longitudinal axis of handle 318 can be approximately perpendicular to and/or approximately parallel to a longitudinal axis of base 312. In an alternative embodiment (not shown), base 312 can have an elongated approximately rectangular shape, or any other shape, provided that base 312 serves to limit an insertion depth of rekeying tool 310 into the lock cylinder. As yet another alternative, another feature of tool 310 can limit its insertion depth.<br>
FIG. 32 is a front view, and FIG. 33 is a perspective view, of an exemplary embodiment of a rekeying tool 310 of the present invention engaged with an .embodiment of a lock cylinder 350 of the present invention. Referring to FIGS. 32 and 33, rekeying tool 310 can be inserted into lock cylinder 350 along a direction, or such that handle 318 is, parallel to a keyway 323 defined through a plug face 322 of plug assembly 320. Base 312 can be configured to approximately conform to an outer surface of cylinder assembly 330.<br>
FIG. 34 is a partially exploded view of an exemplary embodiment of a rekeying tool 310 of the present invention engaged with an embodiment of a lock cylinder 350 of the present invention. Note that prongs 314 can engage with, and/or align to a common level, racks 340.<br>
FIG. 35 is a front perspective view, FIG. 36 is a rear view, FIG. 37 is a side view, FIG. 38 is a front view, FIG. 39 is a rear perspective view, of an exemplary embodiment of a cylinder body 330 of the present invention. Referring to FIGS. 34-39, cylinder body 330 can define a plurality of rekeying tool apertures 332 that can allow rekeying tool 310 to access the plurality of racks of plug assembly 320. Cylinder body 330 can also define a locking bar release tool aperture 335 via which a locking bar release tool 360 (shown in FIG. 40) can access and/or dislocate a locking bar 94 (shown at least in FIGS. 2, 3, 7, 8,12, and 21 A) from engaging with locking bar recess 337 of cylinder body 330.<br><br>
FIG. 40 is a perspective view of an exemplary embodiment of a locking bar release tool 360 of the present invention engaged with an exemplary embodiment of a lock cylinder 350 of the present invention. Locking bar engagement tool 360, which can be as simple as a paperclip, can be inserted through locking bar engagement tool aperture 335 defined in cylinder body 330, such that locking bar 94 (shown at least in FIGS. 2,4,7,8,12, and 21 A) can engage with racks 92 to align, restrict, and/or limit travel of, pins 113.<br>
FIG. 41 is a flow chart of an exemplary embodiment of rekeying method 410 of the present invention. At activity 412, a rekeying tool can be inserted through one or more apertures of the cylinder body, such that the prongs of the rekeying tool engage the racks of the plug assembly. The insertion depth of the rekeying tool can be limited by the geometry of the rekeying tool, such as a shape of the base of the rekeying tool or a prong length, and/or the geometry of the cylinder body and/or plug assembly. For example, if the cylinder body has an elongated circular exterior, an interior and/or contact surface of the base of the rekeying tool can be shaped as an elongated annular segment, the inner radius of that segment approximately matching an outer radius of the cylinder body.<br>
At activity 413, the rekeying tool can relocate the plurality of racks, such that the racks are aligned at a common level. For example, each rack can have a reference point, and full insertion of the rekeying tool can cause each reference point to align along a line parallel to an axis of the cylinder body and/or the plug assembly. As another example, referring to FIG. 12, each of the bullet-shaped features 78 can be aligned with the recesses 111 in the racks 92, allowing the racks 92, and the carrier 90, to move parallel to the longitudinal axis of the lock cylinder 10. Referring to FIGS. 12 and 40, with the racks 92 aligned, a locking bar engagement tool 360 can be inserted into a locking-bar engagement tool aperture 335 in the cylinder body 330 to cause the locking bar 94 to engage with cut-outs in the racks 92, thereby preventing relative movement among the racks, and consequently, relative movement between the pins 113 engaged with the racks 92.<br><br>
At activity 414, with the racks thus "locked" by the locking bar 94, the rekeying tool can be removed from the lock assembly. Then, the plug assembly can be rotated within the cylinder body to a learn position. This rotation can occur without requiring the use of a valid key, and preferably occurs with use of any key. Referring to FIGS. 13 and 14, as the plug assembly is rotated approximately 45 degrees to approximately 90 degrees counterclockwise the locking bar is retained in engagement with the racks.<br>
At activity 415, with the plug assembly in the learn mode, the racks can be disengaged from the pins by pushing the racks away from the pins. Referring to FIGS. 13 and 14, a carrier relocation tool, such as a paperclip or other pointed device 162, can be inserted into the tool opening 54 and pushed against the carrier 90 to move the carrier 90 parallel to the longitudinal axis of the lock cylinder 10 until the spring catch 96 moves into the first detent recess 30, and the pointed device 162 is removed. With the spring catch 96 disposed in the first detent recess 30, carrier 90 is locked in place by the spring catch 96, the racks 92 are disengaged from the pins 113, and the racks 92 are locked in place by the bullet-shaped features 78 (shown in FIG. 6).<br>
At activity 416, a new key can be inserted into the keyway of the plug assembly. As the new key is inserted, the pins can ride up and down the ramps of the key. Once the key is fully inserted, the pin heights can correlate to the new key.<br>
At activity 417, the racks can be re-engaged with the pins. Referring to FIGS. 13 and 14, the new key can be rotated clockwise to release the spring catch 96. As the spring catch 96 leaves the first detent recess 30, the carrier 90 is biased toward the plug face 44 by the return spring 98, causing the racks 92 to re-engage the pins 113. At this point, the lock cylinder 10 is keyed to the new key (i.e., the "new" key) and any previously valid key 160 no longer operates the lock cylinder 10. Thus, the new key can be learned by rotating the plug assembly away from the leam position.<br><br>
Thus, via the rekeying tool, without requiring a valid key, the lock assembly can be placed into a learn mode, in which it can read and conform to a profile of a new key, without removing the plug assembly from the cylinder body.<br>
FIG. 42 is a partially exploded view of an exemplary embodiment of a keying tool 420 of the present invention engaged with an exemplary embodiment of a lock cylinder 10 of the present invention. Keying tool 420 can be used to configure a lock cylinder to suit any appropriate key cut (occasionally a.k.a. "bit spacing"), including a competitor's key cut.<br>
Keying tool 420 can be substantially identical to rekeying tool 310 (shown in FIG. 31), except that keying tool 420 can comprise a carrier retainer 427, that is shaped and/or dimensioned to at least partially fill its corresponding tool aperture 332 in cylinder body 330 (shown in FIG. 39), for instance while longitudinal ends 426 of keying tool's prongs 424 are engaged in rack apertures 103 (shown in FIG. 17A) in a dislocated carrier assembly 42 (shown at least in FIGS. 2, 4, 14).<br>
Thereby, referring to FIGS. 2 and 42, keying tool 420 can prevent the dislocated carrier assembly 42 whose racks 92 are unengaged (possibly because they have not yet been inserted into carrier assembly 42) with their corresponding pins 113, from moving with respect to cylinder body 12 and/or from returning to its original position. That is, via insertion of keying tool 420 into a lock cylinder 10, a carrier assembly 42 that has been moved from a "normal" position to a "dislocated" position can be retained in place with respect to the cylinder body 12, thereby allowing racks 92 that are inserted into the carrier assembly 42 to remain unengaged from pins 113 until the carrier retainer portion 427 of keying tool 420 is removed from, andtor no longer at least partially fills, its corresponding aperture in cylinder body 12, and/or until keying tool 420 is removed from the lock cylinder 10. Keying tool 420 can also align the inserted racks 92 and/or a feature on the inserted racks 92 to a predetermined level.<br><br>
Keying tool 420 can comprise a base 422 having, for example, an elongated annular segment or elongated toroidal segment shape. Attached to base 422 can be a plurality of prongs 424 each having, for example, an elongated approximately rectangular shape. Each of prongs 424 can be approximately perpendicularly attached to an inner surface 423 of base 422, and can have, for example, a concavely shaped end 426. To an outer surface 425 of base 422 can be attached a handle 428, having, for example, an elongated rectangular shape. A longitudinal axis of handle 428 can be approximately perpendicular to and/or approximately parallel to a longitudinal axis of base 422. In an alternative embodiment (not shown), base 422 can have an elongated rectangular shape, or any other shape, provided that base 422 serves to limit an insertion depth of keying tool 420 into the lock cylinder. As yet another alternative, another feature of tool 420, such as carrier retainer 427, can limit its insertion depth.<br>
Each carrier retainer 427 can be adjacent, contiguous, and/or integral with a prong 424, and can have, for example, an elongated rectangular shape. The length of each carrier retainer 427 can be less than its corresponding prong 424. A combined width of each prong/carrier retainer, as measured in a direction parallel to the longitudinal axis of the plug body and/or along a line where the prong and carrier retainer combination attach to base 422, can be greater than a width of the prong 424. Referring to FIGS. 34-39, the orientation and width of at least one prong and carrier retainer combination can be sufficient to substantially fill at least the width of its corresponding rekeying tool aperture 332 in cylinder body 330, thereby preventing a dislocated carrier assembly 42 (shown at least in FIGS. 2,4,14) from returning to its original position.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 28A and 28B, pin 244 can comprise-standardized dimensions and shape, and can comprise a single tooth 246, located in a standard position. As shown in FIGS. 29A and 29B, rack 250 can have a tooth profile that meshes with pin 246, and having a spacing that corresponds to depth increments (occasionally a.k.a. "bit spacing") of the key cut. The tooth spacing of<br><br>
rack 250 can be customized to a particular manufacturer, brand, or model of key and/or lock assembly. For example, Schlage keys and locksets tend to have an 11 mil key cut increment, while Kwikset tends to use a 15 mil key cut increment. Thus, a rack 250 that is intended for use with a Schlage key could have an 11 mil tooth spacing, and a rack 250 that is intended for use with a Kwikset key could have a 15 mil tooth spacing.<br>
Alternatively, either of two standard racks could be selected to correspond to a particular key cut depth. For example, assuming that Kwikset tends to use a 15 mil key cut increment, a first standard Kwikset rack A could have one or more tooth engagements zones (e.g., valleys) at, for instance, 15 mils, 45 mils, and 75 mils, as measured from a convenient location, such as one end of the rack. A second standard Kwikset rack B could have valleys at 30 mils, 60 mils, and 90 mils. Depending on the depth of a particular key's cut for a given pin, the appropriate rack could be chosen. So if a key had a cut depth of 60 mils, a rack B could be selected and used for the corresponding pin.<br>
FIG. 43 is a flow chart of an exemplary embodiment of keying method 430 of the present invention.<br>
At activity 432, the rack carrier can be pushed away from the pins, such that it moves from a "normal" position to a "dislocated" position. This can be accomplished by inserting a carrier relocation tool, such as a paperclip, into a carrier relocation tool aperture found in a front face of the plug, such that the tool engages and pushes the carrier backward. With the carrier dislocated, a keying tool and/or rack alignment tool, such as that shown in FIG. 42, can be inserted into apertures in the cylinder body. Because the keying tool can retain the carrier in the dislocated position, the carrier relocation tool can now be removed.<br>
The insertion depth of the keying tool can be limited by the geometry of the keying toot, such as a shape of the base of the keying tool or a prong length, and/or the geometry of the cylinder body and/or plug assembly. For example, if the cylinder body has a elongated circular exterior, an interior and/or contact<br><br>
surface of the base of the keying tool can be shaped as an elongated annular segment, the inner radius of that segment approximately matching an outer radius of the cylinder body.<br>
At activity 433, the racks can be selected, potentially to correspond to a manufacturer, brand, and/or model of key and/or lock assembly, and/or to correspond to a key cut. The selected racks can be inserted into their respective slots of the carrier assembly. At activity 434, the keying tool can align the inserted racks.<br>
At activity 435, a key can be inserted into the keyway of the plug assembly. As the key is inserted, the pins can ride up and down the ramps of the key to land and/or align with flats of the key. Once the key is fully inserted, the heights of the pins and/or the pin teeth can correlate to the profile of the key.<br>
At activities 436 and 437, the racks can be engaged with the pins by removing the keying tool, such that the carrier spring biases and/or relocates the carrier back into its "normal* position.<br>
At activity 438, the key can be learned by rotating the plug assembly away from the learn position.<br>
Thus, via the keying tool, the lock assembly can be assembled to conform to a profile of a key, without removing the plug assembly from the cylinder body.<br>
The above-described exemplary embodiments, of course, are not to be construed as limiting the breadth of the present invention. Modifications and other alternative constructions will be apparent that are within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims.<br><br><br><br><br>
