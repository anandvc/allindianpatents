				<td>A METHOD FOR OBTAINING A BONE MARROW<br>
FRACTION IN VITRO<br>
This application claims the benefit of U.S. Patent Serial Nos. 60/485,445 filed July<br>
9, 2003, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. This application<br>
is also related to U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 10/116,729, filed April 4,2002<br>
(published as U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2002/0182664 on December 5,<br>
2002) which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
The instant invention does not use mesenchymal cells derived<br>
from the human embryo.<br>
The present application relates generally to compositions and methods of promoting<br>
tissue growth and, in particular, to a bone marrow isolate rich in one or more connective<br>
tissue (e.g., bone) growth promoting components, methods of forming the isolate and<br>
methods of promoting connective tissue growth using the isolate.<br>
Currently, when bone marrow is used in a bone grafting procedure, the marrow is<br>
typically aspirated from the iliac crest and placed directly on the bone graft without any<br>
secondary processing of the bone marrow. The majority of the bone marrow aspirate is<br>
blood which offers minimal benefit to facilitating bone formation. Further, there is a large<br>
content of platelets in blood that release undesirable growth factors such as PDGF (platelet<br>
derived growth factor), TGF-beta (transforming growth factor beta), and FGF (fibroblast<br>
growth factor) that have been shown under some circumstances to have an inhibitory<br>
effect on bone formation.<br>
Accordingly, there exists a need for improved or alternative techniques for<br>
isolating components from bone marrow, particularly components which promote<br>
connective tissue formation, and using the isolated components in connective tissue<br>
repair procedures such as bone grafting and cartilage repair.<br>
In one embodiment, the invention provides a method for obtaining a bone marrow<br>
fraction. This method includes centrifuging a biological sample including whole blood<br>
and bone marrow to provide a separation of components of the sample based upon density.<br>
This separation provides the following tractions in decreasing order of density: (1) a<br>
fraction rich in blood cells; (2) a buffy coat fraction; (3) a platelet rich fraction; and (4) a<br>
platelet poor fraction. The buffy coat fraction is isolated alone or in combination with all<br>
or part of the platelet rich fraction, so as to form an isolate rich in connective tissue growth<br>
promoting components.<br>
In another embodiment, the invention provides a method for treating a patient. The<br>
method includes isolating a bone marrow fraction including components that promote<br>
connective tissue formation, and implanting the bone marrow fraction into a patient at a<br>
tissue defect site. In accordance with the invention, the isolation of the bone marrow<br>
fraction is performed intraoperatively with the implantation.<br>
In another embodiment, the invention provides a method for treating a patient that<br>
includes obtaining a sample from bone marrow of the patient, and centrifuging the sample<br>
to separate tire sample into fractions based upon density, the fractions including a fraction<br>
rich in tissue promoting components. The fraction rich in tissue growth promoting<br>
components is isolated and is implanted into the patient. In accordance with the invention,<br>
the obtaining, centrifuging, and isolating steps are performed intraoperatively with the<br>
implanting step.<br>
In another embodiment, the invention provides a method for obtaining a bone<br>
marrow fraction rich in connective tissue growth promoting components. The method<br>
includes centrifuging a biological sample comprising bone marrow to separate components<br>
of the sample into fractions based upon density, the fractions including a fraction rich in<br>
growth promoting components. The fraction rich in tissue growth promoting components<br>
is then isolated.<br>
Additional embodiments of the invention as well as features and advantages will<br>
be apparent from the descriptions herein.<br>
FIGS. 1-6 show testing results for the separation and isolation of a fraction rich<br>
connective tissue growth promoting components from biological samples comprising<br>
whole blood and bone marrow aspirate from six different donors wherein FIG. 1 shows the<br>
testing results for donor number 30500, FIG. 2 shows the testing results for donor number<br>
30501, FIG. 3 shows the testing results for donor number 30506, FIG. 4 shows the testing<br>
results for donor number 30526, FIG. 5 shows the testing results for donor number 30527,<br>
and FIG. 6 shows the testing results for donor number 30561.<br>
For the purposes of promoting an understanding of the principles of the invention,<br>
reference will now be made to certain embodiments thereof and specific language will be<br>
used to describe the same. It will nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the<br>
scope of the invention is thereby intended, and alterations and modifications in the.<br>
illustrated implants, and further applications of the principles of the invention as illustrated<br>
herein are contemplated as would normally occur to one skilled in the art to which the<br>
invention relates.<br>
As disclosed above, the present invention provides isolates that are rich in one or<br>
more connective tissue (e.g., bone) growth promoting components derived from bone<br>
marrow, methods of forming the isolates and methods of promoting connective tissue<br>
growth using the isolates.<br>
Whole blood includes the following components: plasma, red blood cells, white<br>
blood cells and platelets. The liquid portion of whole Wood, which is referred to as<br>
plasma, is a protein-salt solution in which red and white blood cells and platelets are<br>
suspended. Plasma, which is 90 percent water, constitutes about 55 percent of the total<br>
blood volume. Plasma contains albumin (the chief protein constituent), fibrinogen<br>
(responsible, in part, for the clotting of blood), globulins (including antibodies) and other<br>
clotting proteins. Plasma serves a variety of functions, from maintaining a satisfactory<br>
blood pressure and providing volume to supplying critical proteins for blood clotting and<br>
immunity. Plasma is obtained by separating the liquid portion of blood from the cells<br>
suspended therein. Red blood cells (erythrocytes) contain hemoglobin, an iron-containing<br>
protein that carries oxygen throughout the body while giving blood its red color. The<br>
percentage of blood volume composed of red blood cells is called the "hematocrit." White<br>
blood cells (leukocytes) are responsible for protecting the body from invasion by foreign<br>
substances such as bacteria, fongi and viruses. Several types of white blood cells exist for<br>
this purpose, such as granulocytes and macrophages which protect against infection by<br>
surrounding and destroying invading bacteria and viruses, and lymphocytes which aid in<br>
the immune defense. Platelets (thrombocytes) are small cellular components of blood that<br>
help the clotting process by sticking to the lining of blood vessels. Platelets prevent both<br>
massive blood loss resulting from trauma and blood vessel leakage that would otherwise<br>
occur.<br>
If whole blood is collected and prevented from clotting by the addition of an<br>
appropriate anticoagulant, it can be centrifuged into its component parts. Centrifugation<br>
will result in the red blood cells, which have the highest density, packing to the most outer<br>
portion of the rotating container, while plasma, being the least dense will settle in the inner<br>
portion of the rotating container. Separating the plasma and red blood cells is a thin white<br>
or grayish layer called the buffy coat. The buffy coat layer includes the white blood cells<br>
and platelets, which together make up about 1 percent of the total blood volume.<br>
Bone marrow is a complex tissue comprised of hematopoietic stem cells, red and<br>
white blood cells and their precursors, mesenchymal stem and progenitor cells, stromal<br>
cells and their precursors, and a group of cells including fibroblasts, reticulocytes,<br>
adipocytes, and endothelial cells which form a connective tissue network called "stroma".<br>
Cells from the stroma morphologically regulate the differentiation of hematopoietic cells<br>
through direct interaction via cell surface proteins and the secretion of growth factors and<br>
are involved in the foundation and support of the bone structure. Studies using animal<br>
models have suggested that bone marrow contains "pre-stromal" cells which have the<br>
capacity to differentiate into cartilage, bone, and other connective tissue cells. Beresfotd<br>
"Osteogenic Stem Cells and the Stromal System of Bone and Marrow", Clin. Orthop.,<br>
240:270,1989. Recent evidence indicates that these cells, called pluripotent stromal stem<br>
cells or mesenchymal stem cells, have the ability to generate into several different types<br>
of cell lines (i.e., osteocytes, chondrocytes, adipocytes, etc.) upon activation. However,<br>
the mesenchymal stem cells are present in the tissue in very minute amounts with a wide<br>
variety of other cells (i.e., erythrocytes, platelets, neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes,<br>
eosinophils, basophils, adipocytes, etc.), and, in an inverse relationship with age, they are<br>
capable of differentiating into an assortment of connective tissues depending upon the<br>
influence of a number of bioactive factors.<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention, a biological sample comprising<br>
bone marrow is centrifuged to separate the components of the sample into various<br>
fractions based on density, including a fraction rich in connective tissue growth promoting<br>
components such as mesenchymal stem cells. The fraction rich in connective tissue<br>
growth promoting components is then isolated. The resulting isolate can contain one or<br>
more connective tissue growth components at a higher concentration than present in the<br>
original sample. The resulting isolate can be applied directly to the site of a bone or other<br>
tissue defect. Alternatively, the isolate can be combined with a carrier and the resulting<br>
implant can be applied to the site of a bone or other tissue defect. In these regards, in<br>
certain embodiments of the invention, a cell-containing isolate fraction can be applied to<br>
the tissue defect site either alone or in combination with a carrier or other substance (e.g.<br>
another therapeutic substance) without any ex vivo expansion or other culturing of the<br>
isolate. In such uses, the isolate fraction can, if desired, be loaded into a suitable delivery<br>
device such as a syringe, catheter, or the like, without any such expansion or other<br>
culturing. The isolate can also be modified (e.g., by transfection with a nucleic acid<br>
encoding an osteogenic polypeptide) prior to application to the site of a bone or other<br>
tissue defect or for other uses. The isolate can consist essentially of bone marrow (e.g.,<br>
bone marrow aspirate). For example, according to one embodiment of the invention, bone<br>
marrow aspirate can be the only cell-containing component of the isolate.<br>
As well, the biological sample that is centrifuged can be free from cell culture<br>
medium materials, and in certain forms of the invention the biological sample that is<br>
centrifuged can consist essentially of tissue material (e.g. bone marrow material optionally<br>
in combination with blood or other tissue material) fiom a patient into which the resulting<br>
isolate fraction is to be implanted, optionally containing one or more anticoagulants.<br>
According to a further embodiment of the invention, a biological sample<br>
comprising whole blood (e.g. peripheral blood) and bone marrow is centrifuged to<br>
separate components of the sample based on density. Separation of the sample results in<br>
formation of the following fractions in decreasing order of density: a red blood cell rich<br>
fraction; a white blood cell rich or buffy coat fraction; a platelet rich fraction and a platelet<br>
poor fraction. The buffy coat fraction, potentially along with all or part of the platelet rich<br>
fraction adjacent the buffy coat fraction, can then be isolated to form an isolate rich in<br>
connective tissue growth promoting components. The resulting isolate can contain one or<br>
more connective tissue growth components at a higher concentration than present in the<br>
original sample. Connective tissue growth components include, but are not limited to,<br>
mononuclear cells such as hematopoietic and mesenchymal stem cells. The connective<br>
tissue growth components can include, for example, connective tissue progenitor cells.<br>
In addition to or as an alternative to the use of whole blood in a mixture with bone<br>
marrow material, a fraction of whole blood may be mixed with the bone marrow material<br>
in the formation of a biological sample to be processed by centrifugation. Illustratively, a<br>
red blood cell containing fraction or a plasma fraction of whole blood may be used in a<br>
biological sample to be processed in accordance with the present invention.<br>
The whole blood or fraction thereof to be used in the preparation of the biological<br>
sample to be processed in accordance with the invention can, for example, be human<br>
tissue material. When being used to generate a material for implantation into a patient, the<br>
whole blood or whole blood fraction may be autologous, allogenic, or xenogenic to the<br>
patient. In allogenic situations, the whole blood or fraction may be typed and HLA<br>
matched blood relative to the patient.<br>
The biological sample and/or isolate rich in connective tissue growth promoting<br>
components may also include an anti-coagulant. Suitable anticoagulants include, but are<br>
not limited to, heparin, sodium citrate and EDTA.<br>
Further, the isolate rich in connective tissue growth promoting components can be<br>
combined with a solution (e.g., a sterile isotonic solution). Suitable isotonic solutions<br>
include, but are not limited to, phosphate buffered saline and tissue culture medium such<br>
as minimal essential medium.<br>
As set forth above, a centrifuge can be used to separate a biological sample<br>
comprising bone marrow into various fractions including a fraction rich in<br>
connective tissue growth promoting components. The fraction rich in connective tissue<br>
growth promoting components can then be isolated and the resulting isolate can then be<br>
used in a bone grafting procedure. For example, the isolate can be placed onto or<br>
combined with autogenous bone graft and/or bone graft substitutes to improve their bone<br>
forming potential and fusion rate of the graft.<br>
According to a further embodiment of the invention, a biological sample<br>
comprising bone marrow can be optimized for bone forming effectiveness by<br>
selectively isolating components from the sample that promote bone formation or by<br>
reducing the concentration of components in the sample which inhibit bone formation.<br>
According to an embodiment of the invention, this optimization can be performed in the<br>
operating room with the use of a portable centrifuge such as the Magellan™ centrifuge<br>
system which is manufactured by Medtronic, Inc. The resulting bone marrow isolate,<br>
which is rich in connective tissue growth components, can then be used directly or<br>
combined with a carrier such as autogenous bone graft or a bone graft substitute. The<br>
isolate can be formed (i.e., the biological sample comprising bone marrow can be<br>
obtained, separated into fractions and the fraction rich in connective tissue growth<br>
components isolated) and applied to a tissue defect site in a single procedure (i.e.,<br>
intraoperatively). The tissue defect site can be a bone defect site.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the isolate can be formed and applied to a<br>
tissue defect site in a patient in separate procedures. For example, in a first procedure, a<br>
bone marrow sample can be obtained from the patient. The bone marrow sample thus<br>
obtained can be processed in accordance with the invention to obtain an isolate rich in<br>
tissue promoting growth components. This processing can include processing in<br>
conjunction with a sample of whole blood, e.g. peripheral blood, of the patient, which can<br>
also be obtained during the first procedure. In a second procedure, the isolate obtained<br>
including the tissue growth promoting components can be implanted in the patient at a<br>
tissue defect site, such as a bone defect site.<br>
As noted above, the biological sample from which the connective tissue growth<br>
rich fraction is isolated can comprise a mixture of blood (e.g., peripheral blood) and bone<br>
marrow (e.g., bone marrow aspirate). According to one embodiment of the invention, the<br>
sample can contain one part (by volume) of bone marrow to two parts by volume of blood<br>
(i.e., 1:2 volume ratio of bone marrow to blood). Other volume ratios of bone marrow to<br>
 blood can also be used in the sample. For example, the volume ratio of bone marrow to -<br>
blood in the sample can be 1:1,2:1,1:3, 3:1, etc. The volume ratio of bone marrow to<br>
blood may for example be in the range of 1:100 to 100:1, more typically in the range of<br>
1:3 to 3:1, and can be adjusted to achieve the desired processing characteristics and<br>
amount of isolate.<br>
The bone marrow can be from any source, including for example, from spaces<br>
between trabeculae of cancellous or spongy bone, from medulary cavities of long bones,<br>
and/or from haversian canals. The bone marrow may be from a human or other<br>
mammalian source and, when the bone marrow is to be used to prepare material for<br>
implant in a patient, the bone marrow can be autologous, allogenic, or xenogenic with<br>
respect to the patient. For example, the bone marrow can be aspirated bone marrow<br>
(e.g., bone marrow aspirated from the iliac crest). The blood and bone marrow can each<br>
be taken from a patient, combined into a sample, and the connective tissue growth<br>
component rich fraction of the sample isolated (e.g., via centrifugation) and the isolate<br>
rich in connective tissue growth components applied to a tissue defect site. The<br>
procedure involving forming the isolate and applying the isolate to the defect site can be<br>
carried out during a single operation (i.e. intraoperatively).<br>
According to further embodiments of the invention, the isolate rich in connective<br>
tissue growth components can have a platelet yield (i.e., platelet concentration in the<br>
isolate divided by platelet concentration in initial sample) that is greater than 2 times, 3<br>
times or 4 times that of the initial sample. The isolate<br>
rich in connective tissue growth components can also have a hematocrit content ofless<br>
than 50%, less than 25% or less than 12.5% by volume. According to one embodiment of<br>
the invention, the isolate rich in connective tissue growth components can have a platelet<br>
yield (i.e., platelet concentration in the isolate divided by platelet concentration in initial<br>
sample) greater than 4 times that of the initial sample and a hematocrit content of less than<br>
12.5% by volume.<br>
As set forth above, separation of the biological sample comprising bone marrow<br>
into various fractions including a fraction rich in connective tissue growth components can<br>
be performed using a centrifuge system. Any centrifuge system capable of separating a<br>
biological sample (e.g., a sample comprising blood) into fractions can be used. An<br>
exemplary centrifuge is the Magellan™ Autologous Platelet Separator (APS) system,<br>
manufactured by Medtronic, Inc. Centrifuge systems and methods of separating blood<br>
into various fractions are disclosed in the following U.S. patent applications: U.S. Patent<br>
Application Serial No. 09/832,517, filed April 9,2001, published February 21,2002 as<br>
U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 20020022213; U.S. Patent Application Serial No.<br>

published March 27, 2003 as U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 20030060352; U.S.<br>
Patent Application Serial No. 10/116,729, filed April 4,2002, published December 5,<br>
2002 as U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 20020182664; and U.S. Patent<br>
Application Serial No. 09/833,230, fled April 9,2001, published October 10, 2002 as U.S.<br>
Patent Application Publication No. 20020147098. Each of these applications is<br>
incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The methods and systems disclosed in<br>
these applications can be used to isolate the connective tissue growth component rich<br>
fraction from a biological sample comprising bone marrow. In particular, a sample<br>
comprising blood and bone marrow can be centrifuged and the fraction corresponding to<br>
the buffy coat fraction (i.e., the second most dense fraction) and all or part of the platelet<br>
rich plasma fraction (i.e., the denser region of the plasma layer adjacent the buffy coat<br>
fraction) can be isolated using an apparatus and method as disclosed in the aforementioned<br>
applications. According to an embodiment of the invention, the apparatus can comprise a<br>
sensor assembly which can be used to identify the interfaces between separated fractions<br>
of the sample based on changes in fluid density. For example, the interface between the<br>
region rich in red blood cells and the buffy coat fraction or platelet rich plasma fraction<br>
and the interface between the platelet rich plasma fraction and a platelet poor plasma<br>
fraction can be identified using a sensor assembly as set forth in the aforementioned<br>
applications. Knowledge of the location of the interfaces between the separated fractions<br>
of the sample can be used to isolate the desired fraction from the sample.<br>
The connective tissue growth component rich fraction which is isolated from the<br>
biological sample can comprise the buffy coat fraction (i.e., the second most dense<br>
fraction) and all or part of the platelet rich plasma fraction (i.e., the denser region of the<br>
plasma layer adjacent the buffy coat fraction) resulting from the separation of the sample<br>
comprising blood and bone marrow. According to a further embodiment of the invention,<br>
the isolate can comprise up to 50% by volume of the sample. For example, the isolate can<br>
comprise up to 40%, 30%, or 20% by volume of the sample. According to a preferred<br>
embodiment of the invention, the connective tissue growth component rich fraction which<br>
is isolated from the biological sample can comprise from 5 to 17 percent by volume of the<br>
original sample. For example, in a 60cc sample, the isolate can have a volume of from 3<br>
to 10cc. According to a further embodiment, the isolate can comprise approximately 10 %<br>
by volume of the original sample (e.g., 6 cc of isolate for a 60cc sample). Although a 60cc<br>
sample volume is disclosed above, larger or smaller volume biological samples can also be<br>
used. For example, the volume of the biological sample can be chosen based on the<br>
amount of blood or bone marrow available and/or on the amount of isolate required for a<br>
given procedure. For example, the biological sample can have a volume of up to lOOcc,<br>
75cc, 50cc, or 25cc.<br>
Centrifugation of the sample is conducted for a time and at a rate of rotation<br>
sufficient to achieve the desired degree of separation. For example, centrifugation can be<br>
conducted for approximately 60 seconds to 10 minutes at a rate of rotation between 0 and<br>
5,000 rpm. According to one embodiment of the invention, centrifugation is conducted<br>
for 17 to 20 minutes. It will be understood by those of skill in the art that faster speeds of<br>
rotation will generally separate the components of the biological sample in a shorter period<br>
of time. Generally, it will be desirable to achieve the separation over a period of tirne of<br>
about 60 minutes or less. Further, when a bone marrow material is harvested from a<br>
patient to develop a fraction for re-implantation, the centrifugation of the biological<br>
sample including bone marrow is desirably conducted soon after harvest of the bone<br>
marrow, for example within about 2 hours and desirably within about 1 hour. As well, the<br>
re-implantation of such an isolate fraction in accordance with the invention can take place<br>
soon after obtaining the isolate fraction, for example within about 2 hours, and desirably<br>
within about 1 hour. In still further embodiments of the invention, the harvest of the bone<br>
marrow fraction, the centrifugation to obtain the isolate fraction, and the implantation of<br>
the isolate fraction can all occur on the same day, e.g. in the course of no more than about<br>
3 hours.<br>
As disclosed above, in one mode of use, an isolated fraction of the invention can be<br>
used for implantation in a patient. As well, isolates of the invention can be used as a<br>
source of components which may be further purified, e.g. in the recovery of isolated cells<br>
from the isolate fraction, and/or in diagnostics or research pertaining to the components<br>
therein, for example in research pertaining to cells contained in an isolate fraction.<br>
The implantation of isolates in accordance with the invention can be made in order<br>
to treat a broad variety of tissue defects for maladies. Illustrative tissue defects that may<br>
be treated include defects in bone, neural, muscle, tendon, dermis, and marrow stroma<br>
tissues. Illustrative bone tissues that may be repaired include those of the sternum,<br>
cranium, long bones, spinal elements such as vertebra, and generally in the repair of tissue<br>
damage relating to bone cysts. Illustrative neural tissues that may be repaired include both<br>
central and peripheral nervous tissue. Cartilaginous tissue can also be treated with<br>
implants in accordance with the invention, including treatments for joint repair, in<br>
providing therapy for osteoporosis, or in the repair of tendons and ligaments in general.<br>
Implants in the treatment of muscle tissue may be made in either cardiovascular or skeletal<br>
muscle. Implants of the invention can also be used within the spinal disc space in the<br>
repair or supplementation of disc nucleus tissue, and in implants for dental applications,<br>
for example involving bone and/or gingival tissue. In each of these or other treatments,<br>
isolates of the invention can be introduced in combination with proteins or other<br>
therapeutic substances, genes, or other beneficial materials.<br>
In the repair of bone tissue, the isolate of the invention can optionally be combined<br>
with at least one bioactive factor that induces or accelerates the differentiation of<br>
progenitor or stem cells into the osteogenic lineage. The isolate can be contacted with the<br>
bioactive agent ex-vivo, or injected into the defect site before, during, or after the<br>
implantation of the isolate. The bioactive agent can be a member of the TGF-ss<br>
superfamily that includes various tissue growth factors, including bone morphogenic<br>
proteins such as BMP-2, BMP-3, BMP-4, BMP-6, and BMP-7.<br>
In the repair of cartilaginous tissue, isolates of the invention may be implanted to<br>
treat shallow cartilage chondral defects or full thickness cartilage defects, to treat patellar<br>
or spinal disc cartilage, or to regenerate articular joint cartilage, e.g. in patients with<br>
osteoporosis. Joints that may be treated with isolates of the invention include, but are not<br>
limited to, knee joints, hip joints, shoulder joints, elbow joints, ankle joints, tarsal and<br>
metatarsal joints, wrist joints, spinal joints, carpal and metacarpal joints, and the temporal<br>
mandibular joint.<br>
According to a further embodiment of the invention, the connective tissue growth<br>
component rich isolate can be modified prior to implantation. For example, cells (e.g.,<br>
mesenchymal stem cells) in the connective tissue growth component rich isolate can be<br>
modified using appropriate genes and/or proteins to direct a lineage specific expansion<br>
and/or differentiation or a multi-lineage expansion or differentiation.<br>
According to an embodiment of the invention, cells (e.g., mesenchymal stem cells)<br>
in the connective tissue growth component rich factor can be transfected<br>
with a nucleic acid comprising a nucleotide sequence which encodes an osteoinductive<br>
protein or polypeptide. Exemplary osteoinductive proteins which can be encoded by the<br>
nucleotide sequence include, but are not limited to, a BMP, an LMP or a sMAD protein<br>
or an active (i.e., an osteoinductive) portion thereof. The nucleotide sequence which<br>
encodes the osteoinductive protein or polypeptide can be operably linked to a promoter.<br>
For example, the nucleotide sequence can be in a vector such as an expression vector<br>
(e.g., an adenovirus).<br>
Nucleic acids comprising nucleotide sequences encoding LIM mineralization<br>
proteins (LMPs) and vectors and techniques for transfecting cells with nucleic acids<br>
comprising nucleotide sequences encoding LIM mineralization proteins are disclosed in<br>
the following U.S. Patent Applications: U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 09/124,238,<br>
filed July 29,1998, now U.S. Patent No. 6,300,127; U.S. Patent Application Serial No.<br>
09/959,578, filed April 28,2000, pending; U.S. Patent Application Serial No.<br>
10/292,951, filed November 13,2002, published September 25,2003 as U.S. Patent<br>
Application Publication No. 20030180266; and U.S. Patent Application Serial No.<br>
10/382,844, filed on March 7,2003, published December 4, 2003 as U.S. Patent<br>
Application Publication No. 20030225021. Each of these applications is incorporated by<br>
reference herein in its entirety. Any of the materials and techniques disclosed in these<br>
applications can be used to modify cells in the connective tissue growth component rich<br>
factor.<br>
The osteoinductive polypeptide encoded by the nucleic acid can be an active<br>
(i.e., osteoinductive) portion of a human LIM mineralization protein (e.g., hLMP-1 or<br>
hLMP-3). For example, the osteoinductive polypeptide can comprise at least "n"<br>
consecutive amino acids from the sequence of hLMP-1 or hLMP-3 wherein n is 5, 10, 15<br>
or 20.<br>
According to a further embodiment of the invention, the osteoinductive<br>
polypeptide can be an osteoinductive portion of hLMP-1 or hLMP-3 which comprises<br>
at least "n" consecutive amino acids from the amino acid sequence:<br>
ASAPAADPPRYTFAPSVSLNKTARPFGAPPPADSAPQQNG (SEQ ID NO:l)<br>
or at least "n" consecutive amino acids from the amino acid sequence:<br>
ASAPAADPPRYTFAPSVSLNKTARPFGAPPPADSAPQQN (SEQ ID NO:2)<br>
wherein n is 5, 10, 15 or 20. According to a further embodiment of the invention, the<br>
osteoinductive polypeptide can be an osteoinductive portion of hLMP-1 or hLMP-3 which<br>
comprises at least "n" consecutive amino acids from the amino acid sequence:<br>
P P P A D S A P Q (SEQ IDNO:3)<br>
wherein n is 4, 5,6,7 or 8. According to a further embodiment of the invention, the<br>
osteoinductive polypeptide can be an osteoinductive portion of hLMP-1 or hLMP-3<br>
which comprises the sequence:<br>
P P P A D (SEQ ID NO:4).<br>
The osteoinductive polypeptide (e.g., the osteoinductive portion of the hLMP-1 or<br>
hLMP-3 protein) can comprise up to 15 amino acid residues. According to further<br>
embodiments of the invention, the osteoinductive polypeptide (e.g., the osteoinductive<br>
portion of the hLMP-1 or hLMP-3 protein) can comprise up to 20,25,30, 35, 40,45 or<br>
50 amino acid residues.<br>
The osteoinductive polypeptide can be a synthetic polypeptide. For example, the<br>
osteoinductive polypeptide can be a synthetic polypeptide having a sequence<br>
corresponding to an osteoinductive portion of hLMP-1 or hLMP-3.<br>
The isolate rich in connective tissue growth promoting components can also be<br>
modified with a conjugate of a protein transduction domain (PTD) and an osteoinductive<br>
protein or a nucleic acid encoding an osteoinductive protein. For example, cells (e.g.,<br>
mesenchymal stem cells) in the connective tissue growth component rich factor can be<br>
contacted with a conjugate of a protein transduction domain (PTD) and an osteoinductive<br>
polypeptide or a nucleic acid encoding an osteoinductive polypeptide. The osteoinductive<br>
polypeptide can be a BMP, an LMP, a sMAD protein or an active (i.e., osteoinductive)<br>
portion of an osteoinductive protein. Conjugates of PTDs and osteoinductive proteins are<br>
disclosed in Provisional U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 60/456,551, filed<br>
March 24, 2003 which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Any of the<br>
conjugates and techniques disclosed in that application can be used to modify cells in the<br>
connective tissue growth component rich factor. Conjugates of a PTD and an active (i.e.,<br>
osteoinductive) portion of a human LIM mineralization protein (e.g., hLMP-1 or hLMP-3)<br>
as set forth above can also be used to modify cells in the connective tissue growth rich<br>
component rich isolate.<br>
Cells (e.g., mesenchymal stem cells) in the connective tissue growth component<br>
rich isolate can also be contacted with an osteoinductive polypeptide. For example, the<br>
isolate can be combined with an osteoinductive protein (e.g., BMP-2). The modified<br>
isolate can then be placed on a carrier and implanted into a patient.<br>
In this regard, carriers that may be used with isolate materials of the invention<br>
can be a dimensionally-stable or non-dimensionally-stable (e.g. paste or putty) carrier.<br>
The carrier can, for example, be a resorbable porous matrix. In this regard, the<br>
resorbable porous matrix is collagenous in certain embodiments. A wide variety of<br>
collagen materials are suitable for the resorbable matrix. Naturally occurring<br>
collagens may be subclassified into several different types depending on their amino<br>
acid sequence, carbohydrate content and presence or absence of disulfide cross-links.<br>
Types I and HI collagen are two of the most common subtypes of collagen. Type I<br>
collagen is present in skin, tendon and bone whereas Type III collagen is found<br>
primarily in skin. The collagen in the matrix may be obtained from skin, bone, tendon,<br>
or cartilage and purified by methods known in the art. Alternatively, the collagen may<br>
be purchased commercially. The porous matrix composition desirably includes Type<br>
I bovine collagen.<br>
The collagen of a carrier matrix can further be atelopeptide collagen and/or<br>
telopeptide collagen. Moreover, non-fibrillar and/or fibrillar collagen may be used. Non-<br>
fibrillar collagen is collagen that has been solubilized and has not been reconstituted into<br>
its native fibrillar form.<br>
Suitable resorbable carrier matrix materials may also be formed of other<br>
organic materials such as natural or synthetic polymeric materials, in addition to or as<br>
an alternative to collagen. For example, the resorbable carrier may comprise gelatin<br>
(e.g. foamed gelatin), or resorbable synthetic polymers such as polylactic acid<br>
polymers, polyglycolic acid polymers, or co-polymers thereof. Other natural and<br>
synthetic polymers are also known for the formation of biocompatible resorbable<br>
matrix materials, and can be used in the invention.<br>
The carrier may also be or include a natural and/or synthetic mineral component.<br>
For example, the mineral component can be provided by a particulate mineral material,<br>
including either powder form or larger particulate mineral materials. In certain<br>
embodiments, the particulate mineral component is effective in providing a scaffold for<br>
bone ingrowth as the resorbable matrix material is resorbed. The mineral material may for<br>
example be bone, especially cortical bone, or a synthetic bioceramic such as a<br>
biocompatible calcium phosphate ceramic. Illustrative ceramics include tricalcium<br>
phosphate, hydroxyapatite, and biphasic calcium phosphate. These mineral components<br>
may be purchased commercially or obtained or synthesized by methods known in the art.<br>
As noted above, biphasic calcium phosphate can be used to provide a mineral-<br>
containing carrier in the invention. Desirably, such biphasic calcium phosphate will have a<br>
tricalcium phosphate:hydroxyapatite weight ratio of about 50:50 to about 95:5, more<br>
preferably about 70:30 to about 95:5, even more preferably about 80:20 to about 90:10,<br>
and most preferably about 85:15.<br>
The carrier can include an amount of mineral that will provide a scaffold effective<br>
to remain in a patient for a period of time sufficient for the formation of osteoid in the void<br>
for which bone growth is desired. Typically, this period of time will be about 8 to about<br>
12 weeks, although longer or shorter periods may also occur in particular situations. The<br>
minimum level of mineral that must be present in the carrier for these purposes is also<br>
dependent on the level of activity of the tissue growth promoting components in the isolate<br>
and whether other substances such as BMP or other osteogenic proteins are incorporated<br>
into the carrier in combination with the tissue growth promoting components of the<br>
isolate.<br>
In certain forms of the invention, the carrier may include a particulate mineral<br>
component embedded in a porous organic matrix formed with a material such as collagen,<br>
gelatin or a resorbable synthetic polymer. In this regard, the particulate mineral:resorbable<br>
porous matrix weight Tatio of the first implant material may be at least about 4:1, more<br>
typically at least about 10:1. In highly mineralized carriers, the particulate mineral will<br>
constitute at least 95% by weight of the first implant material. For example, carrier<br>
materials may be provided comprising about 97% to about 99% by weight particulate<br>
mineral and about 1% to about 3% of the collagen or other matrix forming material.<br>
Moreover, the mineral component may for example have an average particle size of at<br>
least about 0.5 mm, more preferably about 0.5 mm to about 5 mm, and most preferably<br>
about 1 mm to about 3 mm.<br>
Carriers used in combination with the isolate may be non-dimensionally-stable, for<br>
example as in flowable or malleable substances such as pastes or putties. Illustratively,<br>
the carrier may include a biologically resorbable, non-dimensionally-stable material<br>
having properties allowing its implantation and retention at a tissue defect site. Such<br>
carriers can include resorbable organic materials such as macromolecules from biological<br>
or synthetic sources, for example gelatin, hyaluronic acid carboxymethyl cellulose,<br>
collagen, peptides, glycosaminoglycans, proteoglycans, and the like. Such materials can<br>
be used with or without an incorporated particulate mineral component as described<br>
hereinabove. In certain forms, the resorbable carrier can be formulated into the<br>
composition such that the composition is flowable at temperatures above the body<br>
temperature of a patient into which the material is to be implanted, but transitions to be<br>
relatively non-flowable at or slightly above such body temperature. The resorbable carrier<br>
may be formulated into the implanted composition so the flowable state is a liquid or a<br>
flowable gel, and the non-flowable state is a stable gel or solid. In certain embodiments of<br>
the invention, the resorbable carrier can include gelatin, and/or can incorporate a<br>
particulate mineral in an amount that constitutes about 20% to about 80% by volume of<br>
the carrier composition, more typically about 40% to about 80% by volume.<br>
In certain forms of the invention, the carrier can be an osteoinductive matrix<br>
providing biologically inert surfaces which are receptive to the growth of new host bone.<br>
For example, the carrier can be a collagen sponge or another dirnensionally-stable or non-<br>
dimensionalty stable carrier as described above having these characteristics.<br>
The carrier can comprise growth factors which can modulate the growth or<br>
differentiation of other cells. Growth factors which can be used include, but are not limited<br>
to, bone morphogenic proteins, sMAD proteins, and LIM mineralization proteins.<br>
Demineralized bone matrix can also be included in the carrier. For example, powders or<br>
granules of demineTalized bone matrix can be incorporated into the carrier.<br>
The isolate can also be combined with allograft and/or autograft bone. For<br>
example, the isolate can be combined with allograft and/or autograft bone and the<br>
resulting implant can then be implanted into a host. As well, before or after implantation,<br>
an isolate of the invention can be combined with one or more platelet activating agents, for<br>
example thrombin, to activate any platelets contained in the isolate, and/or with other<br>
substances relating to the blood clotting cascade such as fibrinogen.<br>
The isolate or an implant comprising the isolate can enhance or accelerate the<br>
growth of new bone tissue by one or more mechanisms such as osteogenesis,<br>
osteoconduction and or osteoinduction. For example, the isolate or an implant<br>
comprising the isolate can have osteoinductive properties when implanted into a<br>
host. Thus, the isolate or implant comprising the isolate can recruit cells from the host<br>
which have the potential for repairing bone tissue.<br>
The isolate rich in connective tissue growth components or an implant comprising<br>
the isolate can be used in bone repair. For example, the isolate or an implant comprising<br>
the isolate can be applied at a bone repair site, e.g., one resulting from injury, defect<br>
brought about during the course of surgery, infection, malignancy or developmental<br>
malformation. The isolate or an implant comprising the isolate can be used in a wide<br>
variety of orthopedic, periodontal, neurosurgical and oral and maxillofacial surgical<br>
procedures including, but not limited to: the repair of simple and compound fractures and<br>
non-unions; external and internal fixations; joint reconstructions such as arthrodesis;<br>
general arthroplasty; cup arthroplasty of the hip; femoral and humeral head replacement;<br>
femoral head surface replacement and total joint replacement; repairs of the vertebral<br>
column including spinal fusion and internal fixation; tumor surgery, e.g., deficit filing;<br>
discectomy; laminectomy; excision of spinal cord tumors; anterior cervical and thoracic<br>
operations; repairs of spinal injuries; scoliosis, lordosis and kyphosis treatments;<br>
intermaxillary fixation of fractures; mentoplasty; temporomandibular joint replacement;<br>
alveolar ridge augmentation and reconstruction; inlay osteoimplants; implant placement<br>
and revision; sinus lifts; cosmetic enhancement; etc. Specific bones which can be repaired<br>
or replaced with the isolate or implant comprising the isolate include, but are not limited<br>
to: the ethmoid; frontal; nasal; occipital; parietal; temporal; mandible; maxilla; zygomatic;<br>
cervical vertebra; thoracic vertebra; lumbar vertebra; sacrum; rib; sternum; clavicle;<br>
scapula; humerus; radius; ulna; carpal bones; metacarpal bones; phalanges; ilium;<br>
ischium; pubis; femur; tibia; fibula; patella; calcaneus; tarsal and metatarsal bones.<br>
The isolate rich in connective tissue growth components or an implant comprising<br>
the isolate can also be used in cartilage repair. For example, the isolate or an implant<br>
comprising the isolate can be applied at a cartilage defect site. For example, the isolate can<br>
be used at the site of an articular cartilage defect.<br>
The isolate rich in connective tissue growth components or an implant<br>
comprising the isolate can also be used in soft tissue repair.<br>
The bone marrow can be aspirated bone marrow. The bone marrow can be<br>
autologous bone marrow aspirated from the patient being treated for a tissue defect. The<br>
bone marrow can be obtained using known techniques. According to an embodiment of<br>
the invention, the bone marrow can be aspirated (e.g., from the iliac crest) using Jamshedi<br>
needles.<br>
The methods described herein for isolating a fraction rich in connective tissue<br>
growth promoting components offer numerous advantages. First, the methods do not<br>
require the use of separation media such as density gradient media, although it will be<br>
understood that in certain embodiments of the invention, the use of such separation media<br>
will be encompassed. These separation media are not approved for introduction into<br>
humans. Therefore, when separation media that cannot be introduced into the patient are<br>
employed, a series of washing steps are required to eliminate the separation media from<br>
the isolated cell populations. The preferred methods disclosed herein can be used to<br>
isolate the desired cells without the use of a separation media and therefore do not require<br>
separate washing steps. Accordingly, isolates of the invention to be implanted can be<br>
loaded into delivery devices, such as syringes, catheters, and the like, without any<br>
intervening washing step. The preferred methods described herein also allow for the<br>
intraoperative isolation and use of the isolate for tissue repair. Further, the preferred<br>
methods described herein allow for the use of relatively small sample sizes (e.g., 60 cc or<br>
less).<br>
For the purpose of promoting a further understanding of the invention, the<br>
following Experimentals are provided. It will be understood that these Experimentals are<br>
illustrative and not limiting of the invention.<br>
Experimental 1<br>
The following non-limiting examples are intended to illustrate methods of forming<br>
an isolate rich in connective tissue growth promoting components from a biological<br>
sample comprising whole blood and bone marrow.<br>
Biological samples comprising mixtures of 20 mL anticoagulated bone marrow and 40 mL<br>
anticoagulated blood were processed using the Magellan™ APS system. The fraction rich<br>
in connective tissue growth promoting components from each run was then isolated. The<br>
resulting isolate was then evaluated for platelet yield (i.e., platelet concentration in the<br>
isolate divided by the platelet concentration in the initial sample) and for hematocrit<br>
content. For each run, the isolate had a volume of approximately 6cc and included the<br>
buffy coat fraction and portions of the adjacent platelet rich fraction of the sample.<br>
The testing results for each run are set forth in FIGS. 1-6 wherein FIG. 1 shows<br>
the testing results for donor number 30500, FIG. 2 shows the testing results<br>
for donor number 30501, FIG. 3 shows the testing results for donor number 30506, FIG. 4<br>
shows the testing results for donor number 30526, FIG. 5 shows the testing results for<br>
donor number 30527, and FIG. 6 shows the testing results for donor number 30561. In<br>
FIGS. 1-6, the fraction rich in connective tissue growth promoting components is<br>
designated "PRP". Other fractions of the biological sample are designated "PPP" for<br>
platelet poor plasma (i.e., the lowest density fraction), and "PRBC" for the red blood cell<br>
containing fraction (i.e., highest density fraction). Runs that were deemed unacceptable<br>
were excluded from the analysis. An acceptable separation run is defined as a run in which<br>
no untoward incidences are encountered. These untoward incidences include, but are not<br>
limited to: Failures due to operator error; Loss of ability to perform CBC counts in a<br>
reliable manner, and; Excessive platelet activation during venipuncture or transport which<br>
is manifested by excessive platelet clumping during or immediately after the separation<br>
process.<br>

Results and Data<br>
The results of each run are summarized in the following table which shows the<br>
platelet yield and the % hematocrit by volume for the isolate rich in connective tissue<br>
growth components from each sample. Platelet Yield is the ratio of the platelet<br>
concentration in the isolate to that in the initial sample.<br>
Conclusion<br>
As can be seen from the above data, all six (6) separation runs conducted with the<br>
Magellan™ APS system had a concentration of platelets in the isolate rich in connective<br>
tissue growth promoting components (i.e., the PRP fraction) of greater than 4 times that of<br>
the original sample. In addition, all six (6) separation<br>
runs also resulted in an isolate rich in connective tissue growth promoting components<br>
(i.e., a PRP fraction) having a hematocrit (HCT) content of less than 12.5%.<br>
Experimental 2<br>
A connective tissue growth component rich fraction of a sample comprising blood<br>
and bone marrow has been isolated. Cells including mesenchymal stem cells in the isolate<br>
were then transfected with various doses of an adenoviral vector for hLMP-1 (i.e.,<br>
AdVLMP). The cells were then implanted into rats using an athymic rat ectopic model.<br>
