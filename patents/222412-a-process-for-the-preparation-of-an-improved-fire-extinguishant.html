Still 'another type of fire extinguishant formulations ~r extinguishing the A, B and C class of fires or any such fire, as known in the prior art, generally comprise of organic compounds, such.as ethyl vinyl, polymers, copolymers etc.<br><br><br>
The disadvantages of such known fire extinguishant formulations comprising of organic compounds, such as ethyl vinyl, polymers, copolymers etc., as stated above, is that the decomposition products of the said formulations after extinguishing the fire of class A, B and C or any such fire thus resulted are harmful and not environment friendly, and the thermal characteristics of such fomulations are not better, which in turn limits the application of the said formulation products.<br><br>
Still further an another type of fire extinguishant formulations for extinguishing the A, B and C class of fires as known in the prior art, generally comprise of inorganic and / or organic siloxnolates and / or siliconates, such as sodium aluminomethyl siloxanolates, sodium organosiliconates etc.<br><br><br>
The disadvantages of such known fire extinguishant formulations comprising of inorganic and / or organic silicates and / or siliconates, as stated above, is that the formulation thus resulted is very expensive, which in turn limits the application of the said formulation products.<br><br><br>

The disadvantages of such known fire extinguishant formulations comprising of two active basic materials, such as sulphates and phosphates both, as stated above, is that the formulations thus resulted in turn result in the<br><br>
decomposition products comprising of oxides of sulphur, which 1'in turn are not environment friendly.<br><br><br>
The fire extinguishant is expected to have properties, like electrical insulation, low or cold temperature resistance and as well suitable at high temperature, fire fighting efficiency and free flow characteristics, better non-hygroscopicity and still being non-toxic and resulting in the environment friendly decomposition products in addition being highly economical.<br><br><br>
The disadvantage of the fire extinguishants known in the prior art, as described here in above, is that these do not have all these properties in one end use product.<br><br><br>
The drawback of the process of preparation of known such fire extinguishant formulations is that, these generally require heavy instrumentation and still resulting in the poor recovery of the solvent.<br><br><br>
The another drawback of process of preparation of known such fire extinguishant formulations is that, the temperature of the process of preparation is as high as 160 0C or above, requiring higher amount of the energy.<br><br><br>
Still another drawbacks of known such processes having the requirements of heavy instrumentation and higher amount of energy and as well resulting in poor recovery of the solvent are that the cost of the process and hence of the end products is increased and this in turn again limit their wider applications / use of the end products among the masses.<br><br><br>

According to the preferred embodiment of the process of this invention the grinding, as stated above is prefera~)1y done by maintaining the speed of the grounding device at 50 to 60 rpm to obtain particle size of the reaction mixtur~ preferably of less than 120 rm. The grounded reaction rnixUure is reacted with homogenous solution of chlorinated rubber taken in the organic solvent, as stated above, first at room temperature preferably for 30 to 50 minutes and then at saturated steam temperature, preferably at 70 to 1100C. This reaction at saturated steam temperature is carried out under vacuum till complete dryness is obtained and simultaneous the solvent is recovered.<br><br><br>
According to the preferred embodiment of the process of this invention the 50 to 112.5 g of chlorinated rubber<br><br>
taken in 1.0 to 1.5 liters of the organic solvent as stated above. The resulted reaction mixture after drying, preferably under vacuum :is heated and dried further at temperature of .80 to 100 ~C. The dried reacted mass is cooled and sieved throu~jh 125 pm sieve, and again heated and dried at the sane temperature, as stated above, that is 80 to 1000C. The fiiil product, that is, fire extinguishant formulation Ln accordance to the present invention is obtained on cool'<br><br>
this reacted mass. The yield of the final formulation is ~J0 to 85%. The solvent recovery is observed more than 90%.<br><br><br>
The fire extinguishant obtainted according the ab ye process, when subjected to physico-chemical characterisat~on and to the trial had shown the values as shown for e1ch characteristic herein below<br><br><br><br><br><br>
It is clear from the foregoing description and the analytical data, as described above, the fire extinguishant, as disclosed in the present invention is definetely better and has all required characteristics. In addition it has been observed to have required free flowing and fire fighting<br><br><br>
•characteristics. The thermally degraded products were free ~om any harmful constituent and were environment freindly.<br><br><br>
The working of the present invention is explained through the following working example, which is not intended to limit the scope of this invention.<br><br><br>
Example - 1<br><br><br>
1875 g of monoammonium dihydrogen phosphate, 225 g;of zircon sand powder mixed with 225 g of barytes rock powder and 100 g of micronised precipated silica, as stated above are taken in the reaction vessel having the arrangements of heating and cooling seperately and are heated at the temperature of 900C for 1 hour under forced air circulation and then mixed in one reaction vessel having the similar arrangements of heating and cooling, as stated above, are and heated at the same temperature, that is at the temperature of 900C for one hour under forced air circulation. The moisture contents of the reaction mixture is maintained less than 0.5% by weight. The reaction mixture after second heating is allowed to cool to room temperature and the reasulted rection mixture is again heated at 95 0C for one hour essentially after grinding at 50 to 60 rpm speed of the stirrer so as to get the particle size of the reaction mixture preferably of less than 120 um. The grounded reaction mixture is reacted with homogenous solution of chlorinated rubber, which in-turn is prepared by dissolving 75 g of chlorinated rubber in 1.5 litres of toluene, first at room temperature for 40 minutes and then at saturated steam temperature of 900C. This reaction at saturated steam temperature is carried out under vacuum tilU complete dryness is obtained and simultaneously the solvent is recovered.<br><br><br>
The resulted reaction mixture after drying under vacuum is heated and dried further at temperature of 1050C for two hours under forced air circulation. The dried reacted mass is cooled and sieved through 125 sieve, and again heated and<br><br><br><br>
dried at the temperature of 100 0C for 1 hour under forced air circulation. 2125 g of the final product, that is, fire extinguishant formulation is obtained on cooling this reacted mass.<br><br>
