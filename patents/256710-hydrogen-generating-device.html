DESCRIPTION<br>
HYDR0GRN GENERATING DEVICE<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a hydrogen generating device for decomposing fuel that contains an organic compound and generating gas that contains hydrogen.<br>
Background Art<br>
The importance of measures to be taken for solving environment problems and resource problems has been increasing in recent years-Efforts have actively been paid to develop fuel cells as one of such measures- Among fuel cells^ phosphoric acid fuel cells (PAFCs) and proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEFCs) require a reforming system for converting the raw material such as hydrocarbon or methanol into hydrogen in order to utilize hydrogen as fuel- Therefore, development of such reforming systems is an important technological challenge from the viewpoint of developing fuel cells.<br>
Methanol, dimethyl ether (DME), ethanol, natural gas, propane and gasoline have been looked into from the viewpoint of reforming fuel of PEFCs for automobiles. Development of reforming systems for methanol has been advanced most because methanol provides the lowest reforming temperature among the above listed. Currently, three reforming methods including steam reforming, partial oxidation reforming and a combination of them are adopted (see Non-Patent Document 1).<br><br>
Non-Patent Document 1: Development and Practical Applications of Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells", pp. 141-166, May 28, 1999, Technical Information Institute Co. Ltd.<br>
Steam reforming is expressed by the reaction formula of CH3OH + H2O -^ CO2 + 3H2, which is an endothermic reaction, and the reforming temperature thereof is 200 to 300°C.<br>
Partial oxidation reforming is expressed by the reaction formula of CH3OH + I/2O2 + 2N2 -^ CO2 + 2H2 + 2N2, which is an exothermic reaction, and the reforming temperature thereof is 200 to 600°C when air is used as oxidation gas-<br>
Combin,ation reforming (typical example) is expressed by the reaction formula of CH3OH +  I/3O2 + 4/3N2 + l/SHzO -^ COz + 7/3H2 + 4/3N2 when air is used as oxidation gas and the emitted heat is about one third of partial oxidation. The reforming temperature of combination reforming is 400 to 600°C-<br>
There is known an invention providing a hydrogen generating device showing a high thermal efficiency that is adapted to generate hydrogen to be supplied to hydrogen utilizing equipment such as fuel cells, using hydrocarbon fuel such as natural gas, LPG, gasoline, naphtha or kerosene and water as starting materials (see Patent Document 1) . A hydrogen generating device according to the above-cited Document ^^has at least a supply section that supplies hydrocarbon fuel, a combustion section that coinbusts the supplied fuel, a water supply section^ a gas mixing section that mixes the supplied fuel and water or steam to generate gas to be reformed and a reforming section filled with a reforming catalyst, and generates reformed gas containing hydrogen from the gas to be reformed under the catalyzing effect of the reforming catalyst.<br><br>
the device being adapted to directly heat at least the gas mixing section and the reforming section by way of a partition wall by a means of combustion exhaust gas generated by the combusting section"- Thus, the reforming temperature of the above-cited device is as high as about 700°C.<br>
Patent Document 1: JP-B-3473900 (Claim 1, paragraphs [0001], f00l7], [0022])<br>
Thus, with any of the above reforming methods, the reforming process has to be conducted at high tenperature that is 200**C or higher for the purpose of generating hydrogen. Therefore, these methods are accompanied by problems including poisoning of the reforming catalyst, elimination of CO contained in the reformed gas (containing hydrogen) and intrusion of nitrogen from air into the reformed gas when the partial oxidation reforming method or the combined method is employed*<br>
Meanwhile, methods and apparatus for generating hydrogen by way of an electrochemical reaction are known for decomposing fuel that contains an organic compound and generating hydrogen-containing gas. Fuel cells realized by using hydrogen generated by way of such an electrochemical reaction are also known (see Patent Documents 2 through 5).<br>

Patent Publication No. 2003/0226763 Patent Document 5: JP-A-2001-297779<br>
Patent Document 2 describes an invention of ^'a hydrogen generating method characterized by arranging a pair of electrodes on the opposite surfaces of a cation exchange membrane, bringing fuel containing at least methanol and water into contact with the electrode containing a catalyst and arranged on one of the opposite surfaces, progressing a reaction of generating hydrogen ions from the methanol and water on the electrode by applying a voltage to the pair of electrodes and taking out electrons from the electrode and transforming the generated hydrogen ions into hydrogen molecules by supplying electrons at the electrode arranged on the other one of the opposite surfaces of the cation exchange membrane" (Claim 1) and also indicates that a reaction of CH3OH + 2H2O ^ CO2 + 6e' +  eH"*" is progressed at the fuel electrode by supplying water or steam with methanol that is fuel to the fuel electrode and applying a voltage by way of an external circuit so as to pull out electrons from the fuel electrode and the generated hydrogen ions are made to pass through the cation exchange membrane so that hydrogen is selectively generated by 6H* + 6e~ -^ 3H2 at the opposite electrode side (paragraphs [0033] through [0038])* Patent Document 3 describes a fuel cell that utilizes hydrogen generated by such a method (paragraphs [0052] through [0056]).<br>
While hydrogen can be generated at low temperature according to the inventions described in Patent Documents 2 and 3 (paragraph [0042] of Patent Document 2, paragraph [0080] of Patent Document 3), a voltage needs to be applied in order to generate hydrogen, and hydrogen is generated at the opposite electrode relative to<br><br>
the fuel electrode but no oxidizing agent is supplied to the opposite electrode. Therefore, these inventions clearly differ from a hydrogen generating device according to the present invention. According to the invention described in Patent Document 4, protons generated at anode 112 that operates as fuel electrode are driven to penetrate through a partition membrane 110 and generate hydrogen at a cathode 114 that is the opposite electrode. ThuSy^ a voltage is applied from a DC power source 120 to the fuel electrode that operates as anode and the opposite electrode that operates as cathode in order to electrolyze fuel of an organic compound such as methanol. Hydrogen is generated at the opposite electrode relative to the fuel electrode and no oxidizing agent is supplied to the opposite electrode- Therefore, the invention of Patent Document 4 clearly differs from a hydrogen generating device according to the present invention.<br>
Patent Document 5 describes a fuel cell system in which a hydrogen generating electrode for generating hydrogen is arranged<br>
(Claim 1) . Patent Document 5 describes that ^'as liquid fuel containing alcohol and water is supplied to a porous electrode (fuel electrode) 1 while air is supplied to a gas diffusion electrode<br>
(oxidizing agent^applied electrode) at the opposite side and a load is connected between the terminal of the porous electrode 1 and the gas diffusion electrode 2/ an electric connection is established to apply a positive potential from the gas diffusion electrode 2 that is the positive electrode of MEA2 having the function of an ordinary fuel cell to the porous electrode 1 by way the load. Then, as a result, alcohol reacts with water to generate carbon dioxide gas and hydrogen ions and the generated hydrogen ions move to the central gas diffusion electrode 6 by way of an electrolyte layer<br><br>
5 to generate hydrogen gas. An electrode reaction takes place along the interface of the gas diffusion electrode 6 and another electrolyte layer 7 and the generated hydrogen gas becomes hydrogen ion once again and moves through the electrolyte layer 7 to get to the gas diffusion electrode 2, Then^ the hydrogen ions react with oxygen in air at the gas diffusion electrode 2 to generate water" (paragraph [0007]), Therefore, the invention of Patent Document 5 is similar to the inventions of Patent Dociauents 2 through<br>
5	in that hydrogen is generated at a hydrogen generation electrode<br>
(gas diffusion electrode 6) by using electric energy generated by<br>
a fuel cell and supplied to the fuel cell and the hydrogen is<br>
generated at the opposite electrode side relative to the fuel<br>
electrode.<br>
There are also known inventions of methods of using a reaction<br>
apparatus that is provided with a partition membrane where an anode<br>
(electrode A) and a cathode (electrode B) are formed by way of a<br>
proton conducting membrane (ion conductor) and oxidizing alcohol<br>
(methanol) while applying or not applying a voltage to the<br>
electrodes or withdrawing electric energy (see Patent Documents<br>
6	and 7) . Both of these inventions relate to a process of oxidizing<br>
alcohol by a means of an electrochemical cell (to generate carbonic<br>
acid diester, formalin, methyl formate, dimethoxymethane, etc.)<br>
and not to a process of generating hydrogen that is a reduction<br>
product as viewed from alcohol.<br>
Patent Document 6: JP-A-06-73582 (Claims 1 through 3, paragraph [0050])<br>
Patent Document 7: JP-A-'06-73583 (Claims 1, 8, paragraphs [0006], [0019])<br><br>
Furthermore r Non-Patent Documents 2 and 3 relate to a direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) and shows that a cell reaction and an electrolytic reaction coexist in a single cell under a condition of an open circuit and being devoid of oxygen and a reaction of CH3OH H- H2O «* CO2 + 6H"*" +- 6e~ takes place at the oxidizing electrode^ while a reaction of GH"^ + 6e" -+ 3H2 takes place at the fuel electrode so that hydrogen is generated at the fuel electrode side- The paper of Non-Patent Docioment 2 concludes that ^^generation of hydrogen not only reduces the power output of a cell in operation but also continuously consumes fuel under a condition of an open circuit so that it is important to sufficiently and continuously supply oxygen to the cathode on a stable basis regardless if the DMFC is in operation or in a standby status.' The paper of Non-Patent Document 3 concludes that '^it is necessary to pay attention to the accumulation of hydrogen that is caused to take place by shut downs and start ups of the system of a DMFC having a large MEA area". Therefore, both of the documents do not intend to generate hydrogen.<br>

Advantages of th© invention<br>
When the hydrogen generating device according to the present invention is adopted^ fuel can be reformed at a temperature not higher than 100""C, that is by far lower than the conventional reforming temperature so that the energy required for reforming can be reduced and the rate at which nitrogen in air intrudes into the generated hydrogen-containing gas can be nil or minimized. Additionally, since the generated hydrogen-containing gas does not contain CO at all;- the produced gas shows a relatively high hydrogen concentration and provides an advantage that a CO eliminating step is not necessary.<br>
Additionally^ the hydrogen generating device according to<br><br>
the present invention can generate hydrogen without externally supplying electric energy to the hydrogen generating cell. However, the hydrogen generating device can generate hydrogen if the apparatus has a means for withdrawing electric energy or a means for providing electric energy from outside.<br>
When the hydrogen generating device according to the present invention has a means for withdrawing electric energy^ the withdrawn electric energy can be utilized to drive a pimp or a blower and/or some other auxiliary machine or machines to provide a remarkable advantage from the viewpoint of effective utilization of energy.<br>
Similarly, when the hydrogen generating device according to the present invention has a means for providing electric energy from outside, the apparatus provides an advantage that the apparatus can generate hydrogen more than the provided electric energy if electric energy is externally supplied to the hydrogen generating cell at a small rate*<br>
In either case, the present invention enables process control by monitoring the voltage of the hydrogen generating cell and/or the rate of generation of hydrogen-containing gas and hence can down-size the hydrogen generating device to reduce the cost of the apparatus -<br>

Best Mode for Carryiag Out the Iziveiit^on<br>
Now, the present invention will be described further by way of the best modes for carrying out the invention.<br>
Note that the hydrogen generating device according to the present invention is basically novel and the embodiments that will be described hereinafter represent only some of the best modes of carrying out the invention and hence do not limit the present invention.<br>
FIG. 1 is a schematic illustration of an example of the hydrogen generating device according to the present invention. The illustrated hydrogen generating device has a hydrogen generating cell (10) and one or more than one auxiliary machines for driving the hydrogen generating device.<br>
As for the structure of the hydrogen generating cell (10) , the cell has a partition membrane (11), a fuel electrode (12) arranged on one of the surfaces of the partition membrane (11) and an oxidizing electrode (14) arranged on the other surface of the partition membrane (11) and is provided with a channel groove (13) for flowing fuel containing an organic compound and water (aqueous solution of methanol) to the fuel electrode (12) and a channel groove (15) for flowing an oxidizing agent (air) to the oxidizing electrode (14).<br>
Additionally, a fuel pump (16) for supplying aqueous solution<br><br>
of laethanol to the fuel electrode (12) and an air blower (17) for supplying air to the oxidising electrode (14) are provided as auxiliary machines for driving the hydrogen generating device.<br>
The channel groove (13) for the fuel electrode is connected to the fuel pump (16) by way of a conduit with a fuel flow control valve (18) interposed between them, while the channel groove (15) for the oxidizing electrode is connected to the air blower (17) by way of a conduit with an air flow control valve (19) interposed between them.<br>
Fuel (100% methanol) is stored in a fuel tank (20) and moved from the fuel tank to a fuel control vessel (21) . Then, fuel is mixed with water in the fuel control vessel (21) and typically adjusted to a 3% aqueous solution of methanol before the fuel is supplied to the fuel electrode (12).<br>
In the hydrogen generating device having the above-described configuration, as electric energy is supplied to the fuel pump (16) and the air blower (17) to drive th^u, aqueous solution of methanol is supplied by the fuel pump (16) from the fuel control vessel (21) to the fuel electrode (12) by way of the channel groove (13) when the fuel flow control valve (18) is opened, while air is supplied by the air blower (17) to the oxidizing electrode (14) by way of the channel groove (15) when the air flow control valve (19) is opened*<br>
Then, as a result^ reactions as will be described hereinafter take place respectively at the fuel electrode and the oxidizing electrode (air electrode) and hydrogen-containing gas is generated from the fuel electrode (12) side*<br>
The rate of generation of hydrogen-containing gas can be adjusted by arranging a voltage controller (22) for monitoring the<br><br>
voltage (open circuit voltage or operation voltage) of the hydrogen generating cell (10) and controlling the rate of supply or the concentration of fuel, the rate of supply or the concentration of air and the electric energy to be withdrawn or to be provided.<br>
The generated hydrogens-containing gas is sorted and separated into hydrogen-containing gas and unreacted aqueous solution of methanol by a gas/liquid separator and part or all of the unreacted aqueous solution of methanol is circulated by a circulation means having a conduit (24) for returning the part or all of the unreacted aqueous solution of methanol to the fuel control vessel (21) . Water may be supplied from the outside of the system depending on the situation.<br>
The hydrogen generating cell (10) in the hydrogen generating device of the present invention is basically composed of a partition membrane (11), a fuel electrode (12) provided on one surface of partition membrane (11) and an oxidizing electrode (14) provided on the other surface of partition membrane (11) as described above. The element configured as described above may be represented by an MEA (membrane/electrode assembly) used in a direct methanol fuel cell.<br>
The method for fabricating an MEA is not limited to any specific one, but a method similar to a conventional one may be employed wherein a fuel electrode and an oxidizing electrode (air electrode) with a partition membrane inserted therebetween are compressed at a high temperature to be assembled.<br>
The MEA fabricated as above is held between the fuel electrode separator provided with the channel groove (13) for flowing the fuel containing an organic compound and water to the fuel electrode and an oxidizing electrode separator provided with<br><br>
the channel groove (15) for flowing the oxidizing agent to the oxidizing electrode so as to constitute the hydrogen generating cell-<br>
In order that hydrogen can be generated easily^ it is preferable that the channel grooves of the both are displaced from each other in provision so that the channel groove of the fuel electrode separator is opposed to the ridge portion other than the channel groove of the oxidizing electrode separator at least partially,<br>
Also, the hydrogen generating cell may be constituted by providing a channel for flowing the fuel containing the organic compound and water to the fuel electrode without using the fuel electrode separator and combining only the oxidizing electrode separator with the MEA.<br>
Suitable partition irieiiibranes may include a proton conducting solid electrolyte membrane which has been used as a polymer electrolyte membrane of a fuel cell. The proton conducting solid electrolyte membrane preferably includes a membrane based on perfluorocarbon sulfonate having sulfonic acid group such as Nafion provided by Dupont,<br>
The fuel electrode or oxidizing (air) electrode is preferably an electrode which is conductive and has a catalytic activity. Production of such an electrode may be achieved by providing a catalyst paste onto a gas diffusion layer and drying the paste, wherein the paste is comprised of a catalyst obtained by blending a precious metal with carbon powder serving as a base, a binding agent such as a PTFE resin, and an ion conductivity conferring substance such as Nafion solution.<br>
The gas diffusion layer is preferably made of a carbon paper<br><br>
treated to be water-repellent.<br>
The catalyst to be applied to fuel electrode is not limited to any specific one, but is preferably a platinum-rutheniiom alloy supported by carbon powder serving as a base.<br>
The catalyst applied to air electrode is not limited to any specific one, but is preferably platinum supported by carbon powder serving as a base.<br>
For a hydrogen generating device configured as described above, when fuel containing an organic compound such as an aqueous solution of methanol is supplied to the fuel electrode, and an oxidizing agent such as air, oxygen or hydrogen peroxide is supplied to the oxidizing (air) electrode, gas containing hydrogen evolves on the fuel electrode under specified conditions.<br>
The hydrogen generating method of the hydrogen generating device of the present invention are quite different from conventional hydrogen generating methods, and it is still difficult at present to explain the mechanism. The hypothesis which is currently thought most likely to be true will be described below, but it can not be denied that the hypothesis would be upset by new reactions which will shed new light to the phenomenon.<br>
According to the hydrogen generating device of the present invention, hydrogen-containing gas evolves, at a temperature as low as 30 to 90°C, from the fuel electrode which receives the supply of methanol and water as will be described below. When no electric energy is supplied from outside to the hydrogen generating cell, gas containing hydrogen at 70 to 80% evolves, while when electric energy is supplied from outside to the cell, gas containing hydrogen at 80% or higher evolves • The evolution of gas depends on the open circuit voltage or operation voltage<br><br>
between the two electrodes. Base on these results, the most likely explanation of the mechanism underlying the evolution of hydrogen is as follows. For brevity, description will be given below on the premise that the cell is kept under circuit-open condition•<br>
Let's assume for example that methanol is applied, as fuel, to a hydrogen generating device of the present invention. Firstly proton is likely to be generated on the fuel electrode by virtue of a catalyst, as is the case with a DMPC.<br><br>
When Pt-Ru is used as a catalyst, methanol is adsorbed to the surface of Pt, and undergoes a series of electrochemical oxidization reactions as described below, resulting in the production of chemical species firmly adhered to the surface of the catalyst ultimately leading to reaction (1) described above, so it is contended (''Handbook of Electric Cell/' Feb 20, 2001, p. 406, Maruzen, 3rd edition)•<br><br>
To further oxidize Pt-(CO)ads, it is necessary to prepare (OH)ads from water*<br><br><br>
For a DHFCr H+ (proton) generated on the fuel electrode as a result of the reaction represented by formula (1) migrates through a proton conducting solid electrolyte membrane to reach the oxidizing electrode where it reacts with oxygen-containing gas or oxygen supplied to the oxidizing electrode as represented by the following reaction formula.<br><br>
Since the hydrogen generating device of the present invention works under open-circuit condition/ e" generated as a result of the reaction represented by formula (1) can not be supplied through an external'circuit to the oxidizing electrode . Therefore, for the reaction represented by formula (2) to occur, it is necessary to supply e" to the oxidising electrode from a different reaction.<br>
By the way, with regard to a DMFC using a proton conducting solid electrolyte membrane such as Nafion, there has been known a phenomenon called methanol crossover, that is, the crossover of methanol from the fuel electrode to the oxidizing electrode. Thus, it is possible that crossed methanol undergoes electrolytic oxidization represented by the following formula on the oxidizing electrode-<br><br><br>
If the reaction represented by forinula (3) occurs, e" produced as a result of the reaction is supplied to allow the reaction represented by formula (2) to occur there.<br>
The H"^ (proton) produced as a result of the reaction represented by formula (3) migrates through the proton conducting solid electrolyte membrane to reach the fuel electrode to undergo there a reaction represented by the following formula to produce hydrogen-<br><br>
In this sequence of reactions, the transfer of H+ and e" produced as a result of the reaction represented by formula (1) on the fuel electrode to the oxidizing electrode and the transfer of H+ and e~ produced as a result of the reaction represented by formula (3) on the oxidizing electrode to the fuel electrode are likely to be apparently canceled out by each other.<br>
Then/ on the oxidizing electrode there arises reaction as represented by formula (2) based on H'^ and e" produced as a result of the reaction represented by formula (3), while on the fuel electrode there arises reaction as represented by formula (4) based on H+ and e" produced as a result of the reaction represented by formula (1) .<br>
Assumed that reactions represented by formulas (1) and (4) occur on the fuel electrode while reactions represented by formulas (2) and (3) occur on the oxidizing electrode, the net balance of chemical reactions is likely to be expressed by the following formula (5).<br><br><br>
The theoretical efficiency of this reaction is 59% (calorific value of 3 mol. hydrogen/calorific value of 2 mol. methanol).<br>
The standard electrode potential EO of the reaction represented by formula (1) is EO = 0,046 V, while the standard electrode potential EO of the reaction represented by formula (4) is EO == 0.0 V. Thus^ if the two reactions are combined to form a cell^ the electrode where the reaction of formula (1) will occur will serve as a positive electrode while the electrode where the reaction of formula (4) will occur will serve as a negative electrode. The reaction of formula (1) will proceed in the • direction opposite to the arrow represented direction-Similarly, the reaction of formula (4) will also proceed in the direction opposite to the arrow represented direction. Thus, the cell will not generate hydrogen.<br>
For the cell to generate hydrogen, it is necessary to make both the reactions of formulas (1) and (4) proceed in the direction represented by the arrow. For this purpose, it is absolutely necessary to.make the reaction of formula (1) occur on a negative electrode and the reaction of formula (4) on a positive electrode. If it is assumed that the entire area of fuel electrode is uniformly at a constant level, it is necessary to shift the methanol oxidizing potential to a lower level or to shift the hydrogen generating potential to a higher level.<br>
However, if the entire area of fuel electrode is not at a constant potential level, reaction on the fuel electrode where<br><br>
methanol and water react to produce H"*" according to formula (1) and reaction on the oxidizing electrode where H"*" and e" react to produce hydrogen according to formula (4) are likely to proceed simultaneously.<br>
As will be described later in relation to Example, a reaction system exposed to a higher temperature is more apt to generate hydrogen^ and thus endothermic reactions (1) and (3) are likely to proceed in the arrow-indicated direction, being supplied heat from outside via other exothermic reactions.<br>
Methanol not only undergoes reactions as represented by formulas (1) and (3), but is also subject^ as a result of crossover, to the subsidiary reaction where methanol permeating from the fuel electrode is oxidized by oxygen on the surface of catalyst coated on the air electrode as represented by the following formula.<br><br>
Since the reaction of formula (6) is an exothermic reaction, heat generated by this reaction is most likely to be used to allow reactions represented by formulas (1) and (3) to occur.<br>
With regard to a hydrogen generating device as described in Claim 4 of the present invention (open-circuit condition hereinafter), as apparent in relation to Example described later, supply of oxygen (air) is decreased^ and when the open-circuit voltage is 300 to 800 mV/ hydrogen evolves. However, this is probably because the oxidation of methanol permeated to air electrode as represented by formula (6) is suppressed, evolution reaction of H+ as represented by formula (3) becomes dominant, and the H+ undergoes reaction represented by formula (4) to<br><br>
produce hydrogen.<br>
AlsO/ in the embodiment which will be described later, the same structure as a typical direct methanol type fuel cell is used, and a channel groove for flowing an oxidizing agent (air) is provided at the oxidizing electrode (air electrode) separator. Thus, a large volume of air flows at the portion of the channel groove and the reactions in (2) and (6) are dominant. However, when the supply of air is reduced, air (oxygen) lacks at the portion other than the channel groove and the H+ evolution reaction in the formula (3) is considered to be dominant.<br>
With regard to a hydrogen generating device as described in Claim 5 of the present invention (discharging condition hereinafter),  hydrogen is likely to be generated depending on the same mechanism as in the open-circuit condition. However, in contrast with the open-circuit condition, it is necessary with this system for H"^ corresponding in volume to discharge current to migrate from the fuel electrode to the oxidizing electrode in order to establish the neutralized electrical condition of the cell. Therefore, it is likely that reaction of formula (1) rather than reaction of formula (4) will occur on the fuel electrode while reaction of formula (2) rather than reaction of formula (3) will occur on the oxidizing electrode.<br>
If discharge current becomes large (because of a large volume of e~ being supplied to the oxidizing electrode), and if discharge voltage is lower than 200 mV, hydrogen will not evolve as will be described later in relation to Example. This is probably because the voltage is not so high as to permit the aqueous solution of methanol to be electrolyzed.<br>
If a large volume of oxygen (air) is supplied or discharge<br><br>
voltage is higher than 600 mV, hydrogen will not evolve either. This is probably because methanol permeated to the air electrode is oxidized there according to the reaction shown in formula (6) , instead of the H+ evolution reaction shown in formula (3).<br>
On the contrary, if supply of oxygen (air) is marginal, the discharge current will be reduced, and if discharge voltage (operation voltage) becomes 200 to 600 mV, hydrogen will still evolve. However, this is probably because the oxidation of methanol permeated to the air electrode as represented by formula (6) is suppressed, evolution reaction of H+ as represented by formula (3) becomes dominant, and the H+ undergoes reaction represented by formula (4) to produce hydrogen.<br>
Even in the discharging condition, similarly to the open-circuit condition case, a large volume of air flows at the portion of the channel groove of the air electrode separator and the reactions in (2) and (6) becomes dominant, but when the supply of air is reduced, air (oxygen) lacks at the portion other than the channel groove and the H* evolution reaction in the formula (3) is considered to be dominant-<br>
With regard to a hydrogen generating device as described in Claim 6 of the present invention (charging condition hereinafter)^ hydrogen is likely to be generated depending on the same mechanism as in the open-circuit condition. However, in contrast with the open-circuit condition, it is necessary with this system for H+ corresponding in volume to electrolysis current to migrate from the oxidizing electrode to the fuel electrode in order to establish the neutralized electrical condition of the cell- Therefore, it is likely that reaction of formula (4) rather than reaction of formula (1) will occur on the fuel<br><br>
electrode while reaction of formula (3) rather than reaction of formula (2) will occur on the oxidizing electrode.<br>
To put it more specifically, with regard to the charging condition where the fuel electrode serves as cathode while the oxidizing electrode serves as anode, electric energy is supplied from outside (e" is supplied from outside to the fuel electrode) . Then, basically electrolysis occurs in the system. As electric energy supplied (voltage applied) is increased, more hydrogen will be produced. This is probably because as more e" is supplied from outside to the fuel electrode, oxidization of methanol represented by formula (3) and reaction represented by formula<br>
(4) (6H"^ + 6e~ —&gt; 3H2) will be more enhanced as will become apparent from the description given below in relation to Example-<br>
However, as will be described later, if supply of oxygen<br>
(air) is marginal, the energy efficiency of the system becomes high when applied voltage (operation voltage) is at a low range of 400 to 600 mV. This is probably because the oxidation of methanol permeated to air electrode as represented by formula<br>
(6) is suppressed, air (oxygen) lacks at the portion other than the channel groove of the air electrode separator board, evolution reaction of H+ as represented by formula (3) becomes dominant, and the H+ undergoes reaction represented by formula<br>
(4) to produce hydrogen at the fuel electrode on the opposite side as described above even in the case of open-circuit condition or discharging condition where electric energy is not provided from outside. Evolution of hydrogen in the charging condition is likely to be generated depending on the same mechanism as in the open-circuit condition and discharging condition as well as on the electric energy supplied from outside.<br><br>
The meaning of the potential of the cell will be described here* Generally, the voltage of a cell having two electrodes with an electrolyte membrane inserted therebetween is determined by the difference between the two electrodes of chemical potentials of ions which serve as conductors in electrolyte.<br>
If polarizations at the two electrodes are ignored, the voltage in question indicates the difference between the two electrodes of chemical potentials of hydrogen, in other words, partial pressures of hydrogen, since this cell uses a proton (hydrogen ion) conducting solid electrolyte membrane.<br>
According to the invention, as will be described later in relation to Example, if there is voltage between the fuel and oxidizing electrodes that is in a certain range, this indicates the evolution of hydrogen on the fuel electrode. Thus, if the difference of chemical potentials of hydrogen between the two electrodes falls within a certain range, reactions as represented by formulas (1) to (6) cited above will proceed which will result in the production of hydrogen.<br>
According to the hydrogen generating device of the present invention, it is possible to adjust the evolution volume of hydrogen-containing gas by varying the voltage (open-circuit voltage or operation voltage) between the fuel electrode and oxidizing (air) electrode, regardless of whether electric energy is withdrawn to outside from the hydrogen generating cell of the device or whether electric energy is supplied from outside to the hydrogen generating cell of that.<br>
As will be described below in relation of Example, the open-circuit condition evolves hydrogen at the open-circuit voltage of 300 to 800 mV; the discharging condition evolves<br><br>
hydrogen at the discharge voltage (operation voltage) of 200 to 600 mV; and the charging condition evolves hydrogen at the applied voltage (operation voltage) of 300 to 1000 mV (energy efficiency is high at 400 to 600 mV) . Thus, it is possible to adjust the evolution volume of hydrogen-containing gas by varying open-circuit voltage or operation voltage in accordance with the voltage range cited above-<br>
As will be described below in relation of Example, it is possible to adjust the open-circuit voltage or operation voltage and/or the evolution volume (rate of hydrogen evolution) of hydrogen-containing gas by varying the supply volume of an oxidizing agent (oxygen-containing gas or oxygen, or hydrogen peroxide-containing liquid), or the concentration of an oxidizing agent (oxygen concentration of oxygen-containing gas) , or the supply volume of organic compound-containing fuel, or the concentration of organic compound-containing fuel.<br>
It is also possible to adjust the operation voltage and/or the evolution volume of hydrogen-containing gas by varying, for the discharging condition, electric energy withdrawn to outside, (varying current withdrawn to outside, or varying the voltage withdrawn to outside using a constant-voltage controllable power source, for example, so-called potentiostat), or, for the charging condition, electric energy supplied to the system (or current supplied to the system, or by varying the voltage of the system using a constant-voltage power source, for example, so-called potentiostat).<br>
Since according to the hydrogen generating device of the present invention, it is possible to decompose organic compound-containing fuel at 100°C or lower, the temperature at<br><br>
which the device can be operated is made 100*^0 or lower. The operation temperature is preferably 30 to 90°C* This is because^ when the operation temperature is adjusted to be between 30 and 90°C, it will become possible to adjust the open-circuit voltage or operation voltage;- and/or the evolution volume of hydrogen-containing gas as will be described later in relation to Example.<br>
Incidentally, for a hydrogen generating cell based on conventional fuel conversion technology the operation temperature should be kept at lOO C or higher. At this temperature range, water will become vapor and organic compound-containing fuel become gas, and even when hydrogen evolves under this condition^ it is necessary to provide means specifically adapted for separating hydrogen. The device of the present invention is also advantageous in this point-<br>
Indeed^ there will arise a problem as described above, when organic compound-containing fuel is decomposed at 100°C or higher • But a hydrogen generating device of the invention may be operated at a temperature slightly above 100°C if there be need to do so.<br>
As long as based on the putative principle, the organic compounds-containing fuel may be liquid or gaseous fuel capable of producing proton as a result of electrochemical oxidization that can pass through a proton conductive partition membrane, and liquid fuel containing alcohol such as methanol, ethanol^ ethylene glycol, 2-propanol, aldehyde such as formaldehyde, carboxyl acid such as formic acid, or ether such as diethyl ether is preferred. Since the organic compound-containing fuel is supplied with water, an aqueous solution of these liquid fuels or aqueous solution of alcohol and particularly methanol and<br><br>
water is preferred. The aqueous solution of methanol cited above as a preferred example of fuel is an aqueous solution containing at least methanol, and its concentration of methanol at a region where hydrogen-containing gas evolves may be arbitrarily determined as needed.<br>
Suitable oxidizing agents may include gaseous or liquid oxidizing agents* Suitable gaseous oxidizing agents may include oxygen-containing gas or oxygen. The concentration of oxygen in oxygen-containing gas is preferably chosen to be 10% or higher particularly. Suitable liquid oxidizing agents may include hydrogen peroxide-containing liquid-<br>
For a hydrogen generating device of the invention, since the fraction of fuel converted into hydrogen is rather small, it is desirable to provide fuel circulating means to improve thereby the fraction of fuel to be converted into hydrogen.<br>
The hydrogen generating device of the present invention has a means for collecting hydrogen-containing gas provided from the fuel electrode. The means is preferably so constructed as to be able to collect carbon dioxide as well as hydrogen. Since the device operates at a temperature as low as lOO C or lower, it is possible to attach a carbon dioxide absorbing portion for absorbing carbon dioxide contained in hydrogen-containing gas to the system by simple means.<br>
Next, illustrative examples (examples of hydrogen generation) of the present invention will be presented. However, the fractions of catalysts, PTFEr Nafion, etc*, and the thickness of catalyst layer, gas diffusion layer and electrolyte membrane are not limited to the values cited in the examples, but may take any appropriate values.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Illustrative examples of generating hydrogen based on the hydrogen generating device of the present invention as described in Claim 4 of the invention (open-circuit condition) will be presented below. [Hydrogen generating example 1-1]<br>
Hydrogen generating cells described in Example 1 {generating examples 1-1 to 1-10) have the same structure as that of representative DMFCs.<br>
The structure of the hydrogen generating cell is outlined in FIG, 2,<br>
The electrolyte membrane consists of a proton conducting electrolyte membrane provided by Dupont (Nafion 115); and the air electrode is obtained by immersing carbon paper (Toray) in a solution where polytetrafluoroethylene is dispersed at 5%, and baking the paper at 360^c to make it water-repellent, and coating^ on one surface of the paper, air electrode catalyst paste comprised of air electrode catalyst (carbon^supported platinum, Tanaka Precious Metal), fine powder of PTFE, and 5% Nafion solution (Aldrich). Thus, the air electrode exists as a gas diffusion layer with air electrode catalyst. In the preparation of the air electrode catalyst paste, the percent contents by weight of air electrode catalyst, PTFE, and Nafion were made 65%, 15% and 20%, respectively* The loading level of catalyst of the air electrode prepared as above was 1 mg/cm^ in terms of the weight of platinum per unit area.<br>
Another carbon paper was similarly treated to be made water-repellent- One surface of the paper was coated with fuel electrode catalyst paste comprised of fuel electrode catalyst<br><br>
(carbon-supported platinum-ruthenium, Tanaka Precious Metal)r fine powder of PTFE, and 5% Nafion solution. Thus^ the fuel electrode exists as a gas diffusion layer with fuel electrode catalyst. In the preparation of the fuel electrode catalyst paste, the percent contents by weight of fuel electrode catalyst, PTFE, and Nafion were made 55%, 15% and 30%, respectively. The loading level of catalyst of the fuel electrode prepared as above was 1 mg/cm^ in terms of the weight of platinum-ruthenium per unit area.<br>
The electrolyte membrane, gas diffusion layer with air electrode catalyst and gas diffusion layer with fuel electrode catalyst were laid one over another to be hot-pressed at 140 C under a pressure of 100 kg/cm2 so that they were assembled to form an MEA. The MEA prepared as above had an active electrode area of 60.8 cm2. The thiclcnesses of air and fuel electrode catalyst layers were practically the same about 30 ym, and the thicknesses of air and fuel electrode gas diffusion layers were similarly the same about 170 pa*<br>
The MEA was further provided on its both surfaces with flow passages through which air can flow and fuel can flow, and was enclosed from outside with an air electrode separator and a fuel electrode separator respectively both made of graphite into which phenol resin is impregnated, in order to prevent the leak of gas from the VlEh. At that time, similarly to the case of a conventional typical direct methanol type fuel cell, a groove is machined in the air electrode separator board to be a flow passage to flow air and the fuel electrode separator board to be a flow passage to flow fuel. The air electrode separator board and the fuel electrode separator board both have the thickness<br><br>
of 2 mm, and the flow passage for flowing air on the air electrode separator board is formed by making three parallel grooves (groove width: 2 mm^ ridge width: 1 rm., groove depth: 0.6 ram) meander in the diagonal direction from the upper part to the lower part of the separator board (the number of turns: 8), while the flow passage for flowing fuel on the fuel electrode separator board is formed by making three parallel grooves (groove width: 1.46 ram, ridge width: 0.97 mm^ groove depth: 0.6 mm) meander in the diagonal direction from the lower part to the upper part of the separator board (the number of turns: 10) . To further ensure the seal of MEA against the leak of fuel and air, MEA was surrounded with silicon--rubber made packing-<br>
In this case, the evolution voliome of hydrogen is changed with the position relation of the grooves and ridges on the air electrode separator board and the fuel electrode separator board. That is, as mentioned above, it is presumed that methanol is diffused to the portion other than the channel groove (ridge portion) of the air electrode separator and H"^ generation reaction representedby the formula (3) occurs. Thus, if the ridge portion of the air electrode separator is at the same position opposed to the ridge portion of the fuel electrode separator, methanol diffusion from the fuel electrode is prevented and hydrogen is hardly generated. Therefore, the groove (ridge) of the air electrode separator and that of the fuel electrode separator are arranged at respective positions that are staggered relative to each other such that such part of the channel groove of the fuel electrode separator is disposed opposite to the ridge part other than the channel groove of the air electrode separator.<br>
The hydrogen generating cell prepared as above was placed<br><br>
in an electric furnace where hot air was circulated. The temperature (operation temperature) of the cell was kept at 30 to lO^Cf air was flowed at a rate of 0 to 400 ml/min to the air electrode^ and 0.5 to 2M aqueous solution of methanol (fuel) was flowed at a rate of 2 to 15 ml/min to the fuel electrode* Then, the voltage difference between the fuel electrode and the air electrode (open voltage), the voliiiue of gas evolved on the fuel electrode and the composition of the gas were m.onitored and analyzed.<br>
First, the flow rate of aqueous solution of methanol (fuel) to the cell was kept 8 ml/min^ and the temperature of air was kept at 30, 50, or 70°C, thereby altering the flow rate of air, and the volume of gas evolving from the fuel electrode was measured. The evolution volume of gas was determined by underwater conversion* The concentration of hydrogen in the evolved gas was determined by gas chromatography, and the rate of hydrogen evolution was determined based on the result.<br>
The results are shown in FIG. 3, Evolution of hydrogen from the fuel electrode of the cell was confirmed with reduction of the flow rate of air for all the temperatures tested. The rate of hydrogen evolution becomes high as the temperature is raised. Studies of relation of the open-circuit voltage (open voltage) with the flow rate of air indicate that as the flow rate of air becomes low, the open-circuit voltage of the cell tends to decline.<br>
FIG. 4 shows a graph for indicating relationship between the open-circuit voltage and the rate of hydrogen evolution, both adapted from the results of FIG. 3.<br>
From this, it was found that the rate of hydrogen evolution<br><br>
(volume of hydrogen evolution) tends to depend on the open^circuit voltage/ and that hydrogen evolves when the open-circuit voltage is in the range of 400 to 600 mV, The rate of hydrogen evolution is the highest around 450 mV  for all the temperatures tested.<br>
Next, fuel was flowed at 8 ml/min and air at 120 ml/min at 70°C to allow gas to evolve^ and the concentration of hydrogen in the gas was determined by gas chromatography .<br>
As a result, it was found that the gas contains hydrogen at about 70%, and carbon dioxide at about 15%. CO was not detected-[Hydrogen generating example 1-2]<br>
The same hydrogen generating cell as that of hydrogen generating example 1-1 was used. The temperature of the cell was kept at 7D'^C^ and IM aqueous solution of methanol (fuel) was applied at the flow rate of 2, 8, or 15 ml/min. Then, relations of the flow rate of fuel^ the flow rate of air, the rate of hydrogen evolution and open-circuit voltage with the flow rate of air were shown in FIG. 5.<br>
From the graph it was found that as the flow rate of fuel decreases, the rate of hydrogen evolution becomes larger.<br>
FIG. 6 shows a graph for indicating relationship between the open-circuit voltage and the rate of hydrogen evolution, both adapted from the results of FIG. 5.<br>
From this^ it was found that the rate of hydrogen evolution depends on the open-circuit voltage, and is the highest around 450 mV for all the fuel flows tested as in hydrogen generating example 1-1,<br>
In this generating example, the highest rate of hydrogen<br><br>
evolution 14.48 ml/min was obtained at the open-circuit voltage of 442 iriV (operation temperature: 70'='C; concentration of fuel: IM; flow rate of fuel: 2 ml/itdn; and flow rate of air: 100 ml/min) . The concentration of hydrogen in the evolved gas was determined by gas chromatography as in example 1-1, and found to be about 70%. [Hydrogen generating example 1-3]<br>
The same hydrogen generating cell as that of hydrogen generating example 1-1 was used. The temperature of the cell was kept at 70'='C^ and aqueous solution of methanol (fuel) at a fuel concentration o£ 0-5, 1 or 2M was applied at a constant flow rate of 8 ml/min. Then, relations of the flow rate of fuel^ the flow rate of air, the rate of hydrogen evolution and open-circuit voltage with the flow rate of air were shown in FIG. 7.<br>
From the graph it was found that as the concentration of fuel decreases, the rate of hydrogen evolution becomes larger.<br>
FIG. 8 shows a graph for indicating relationship between the open-circuit voltage and the rate of hydrogen evolution, both adapted from the results of FIG. 7.<br>
From this, it was found that the rate of hydrogen evolution depends on the open-circuit voltage, and that hydrogen evolves when the open-circuit voltage is in the range of 300 to 600 mV. The rate of hydrogen evolution is the highest around 450 mV for all the fuel concentrations tested as in hydrogen generating example 1-1. [Hydrogen generating example 1--4]<br>
Next, effect of the thickness of electrolyte membrane on the evolution volume of gas was studied.<br>
The hydrogen generating cell was constructed similarly to<br><br>
the above examples, using a Nafion 112 (Dupont) having a thickness of 50 pm, instead of Nafion 115 (Dupont) having a thickness of 130 ]m. as used in the above examples 1-1 to 1-3. The cell was operated: temperature at 70°C; concentration of fuel at IM; and flow rate of fuel at 8 ml/min, and relations of the flow rate of fuel, the flow rate of air and the rate of hydrogen evolution with the flow rate of air were studied*<br>
Both Nafion 115 and 112 membranes are made of the same material as a single difference in their thickness. Thus^ only the thickness of electrolyte membranes serves as a parameter to be studied in the experiment- The study results are summarized in FIG, 9.<br>
FIG. 10 shows a graph for indicating relationship between the open-circuit voltage and the rate of hydrogen evolution, both adapted from the results of FIG. 9.<br>
From this, it was found that the rate of hydrogen evolution was similar regardless of the thickness of electrolyte meiriDrane. hs seen from the figure^ the rate of hydrogen evolution depends on the open-circuit voltage, and is the highest around 450 mV. [Hydrogen generating example 1-5]<br>
A hydrogen generating cell constructed as in hydrogen generating example 1-1 was placed in an electric furnace where hot air was circulated. The temperature of the cell was kept at 30, 50, 70, or 90°C, air was flowed at a rate of 0 to 250 ml/min to the air electrode, and IM aqueous solution of methanol was flowed at a rate of 5 ml/min to the fuel electrode. Then, the open-circuit voltage, and the rate of hydrogen evolution from the fuel electrode were monitored and analyzed*<br>
Relation of the rate of hydrogen evolution with the flow<br><br>
rate of air is represented in FIG, 11.<br>
Similarly to example 1^1, the evolution of hydrogen from the fuel electrode was confirmed with reduction of the flow rate of air for all the temperatures tested. The rate of hydrogen evolution becomes high as the temperature is raised. Studies of relation of the open-circuit voltage (open voltage) with the flow rate of air indicate that as the flow rate of air becomes low, the open-circuit voltage of the cell tends to decline.<br>
FIG. 12 shows a graph for indicating relationship between the open-circuit voltage and the rate of hydrogen evolution; both adapted from the results of FIG. 11.<br>
From this, it was found that the rate of hydrogen evolution depends on the open-circuit voltage, and hydrogen evolves when the open-circuit voltage is in the range of 300 to 700 mV. The rate of hydrogen evolution is the highest around 470 to 480 mV when the temperature is kept at 30 to 70°C, while the peak is shifted to 440 mV when the temperature is raised to 90°C, [Hydrogen generating example 1-6]<br>
The same hydrogen generating cell as that of hydrogen generating example 1-1 was used- The temperature of cell \^a3 kept at 50°C, and fuel was applied at the flow rate of 1.5, 2,5, 5-0, 7-5, or 10,0 ml/min. Then, relations of the flow rate of fuel, the flow rate of air and the rate of hydrogen evolution, with the flow rate of air were shown in FIG. 13.<br>
From this^ it was found that in contrast with example 1-2 where the temperature was kept at 70°C as the flow rate of fuel increases, the rate of hydrogen evolution becomes larger.<br>
FIG. 14 shows a graph for indicating relationship between the open-circuit voltage and the rate of hydrogen evolution, both<br><br>
adapted from the results of FIG. 13.<br>
From this, it was found that the rate of hydrogen evolution depends on the open-circuit voltage, and hydrogen evolves when the open-circuit voltage is in the range of 300 to 700 mV, The rate of hydrogen evolution is the highest around 450 to 500 mV,<br>
After determining the consumption of methanol in fuel and the rate of hydrogen evolution when the flow rate of fuel is varied, the energy efficiency under open-circuit condition was determined by calculation in accordance with the equation described below (which is different from the equation used for determining the energy efficiency of a charging condition). As a result it was found that, under open-circuit condition, the energy efficiency was 17% when fuel flows at 5.0 ml/min, and 22% when fuel flows at 2.5 ml/min.<br>
Efficiency (%) of a hydrogen generating system under open-circuit condition = (change of the standardized enthalpy of hydrogen evolved/change of enthalpy of methanol consumed) x 100 [Hydrogen generating example 1-7]<br>
The same hydrogen generating cell as that of hydrogen generating example 1-1 was used. The temperature of cell was kept at 50°C, and aqueous solution of methanol (fuel) was applied at a constant flow rate of 5 ml/min while the concentration of fuel was varied to 0.5, 1, 2, 3M- Then, relations of the flow rate of air and the rate of hydrogen evolution with the flow rate of air were shown in FIG* 15.<br>
From this, it was found that as the concentration of fuel decreases, the peak of the rate of hydrogen evolution is observed with reduction of the flow rate of air.<br><br>
FIG* 16 shows a graph for indicating relationship between the open-circuit voltage and the rate of hydrogen evolution, both adapted from the results of FIG. 15,<br>

The rate of hydrogen evolution is the highest around 47 0 mV for all the concentrations of fuel tested, [Hydrogen generating example 1-8]<br>
The same hydrogen generating cell as that of hydrogen generating example 1-1 was used (except that the air electrode consisted of an oxidizing electrode to which oxidizing gas was flowed) . The cell was operated: temperature at 50°C; concentration of fuel at IM; and flow rate of fuel at 5 ml/min, while the concentration of oxygen being varied to 10, 21, 40, or 100% and relations of the open-circuit voltage and the rate of hydrogen evolution with the flow rate of oxidizing gas were studied- The results are shown in FIG. 17. The oxidizing gas containing 21% oxygen was represented by air, and the oxidizing gas containing 10% oxygen was obtained by mixing air with nitrogen-The oxidizing gas containing 40% oxygen was obtained by adding oxygen (100% oxygen) to air.<br>
From this, it was found that as the concentration of oxygen increases, the flow rate of oxidizing gas becomes smaller.<br>
FIG. 18 shows a graph for indicating relationship between the open-circuit voltage and the rate of hydrogen evolution, both adapted from the results of FIG.   17.<br>
From this, it was found that the rate of hydrogen evolution depends on the open-circuit voltage, and hydrogen evolves when<br><br>
the open-circuit voltage is in the range of 400 to 800 mV. The rate of hydrogen evolution is the highest at 490 to 530 mV, [Hydrogen generating example 1-9]<br>
The same hydrogen generating cell as that of hydrogen generating example 1-1 was used. The cell was operated at 50°C with the flow of air to the air electrode kept at 60 ml/min and the flow of aqueous solution of methanol (fuel) to the fuel electrode kept at 2, 6 ml/min to cause gas to evolve. A 200 cc of sample was collected from the gas, and the concentration of CO of the gas was determined by gas chromatography. No CO was detected in the gas (1 ppm or lower) . Under the measurement condition the open-circuit voltage of the cell was 477 mV and the rate of hydrogen evolution was 10 ml/min. [Hydrogen generating example 1-10]<br>
The same hydrogen generating cell with that of Example 1-1 was used (except that the air electrode consisted of an oxidizing electrode to which liquid hydrogen peroxide was flowed) . The cell was placed in an electric furnace where hot air was circulated, The cell was operated while the temperature being kept at 30, 50, 70, or gO'^C with the flow of IM H2O2 (hydrogen peroxide) to the oxidizing electrode kept at 1 - 8 ml/min and the flow of IM aqueous solution of methanol (fuel) to the fuel electrode kept at 5 ml/min. Relations of the open-circuit voltage and the rate of hydrogen evolution with the flow rate of hydrogen peroxide were studied.<br>
Relation of the rate of hydrogen evolution with the flow rate of H2O2 is represented in FIG- 19.<br>
Similarly to hydrogen generating example 1-1, the evolution of hydrogen from the fuel electrode of the cell was<br><br>
confirmed with reduction of the flow rate of H2O2 for all the temperatures tested* The rate of hydrogen evolution becomes high as the temperature is raised. Studies of relation of the open-circuit voltage with the flow rate of H2O2 indicate that as the flow rate of H2O2 becomes low, the open-circuit voltage of the cell tends to decline*<br>
FIG. 20 shows a graph for indicating relationship between the open-circuit voltage and the rate of hydrogen evolution, both adapted from the results of FIG. 19,<br>
From this, it was found that the rate of hydrogen evolution depends on the open-circuit voltage, and hydrogen evolves when the open-circuit voltage is in the range of 300 to 600 mV. The rate of hydrogen evolution is the highest around 500 mV when the temperature is kept at 30 to 50°C, while the peak is shifted to 450 mV when the temperature is raised to 70 to 90*^0.<br>
What is important here is that no current or voltage was applied from outside to the hydrogen generating cells of Example 1. The cell was only connected to an electrometer for monitoring the open-circuit voltage which has an internal impedance of 1 GQ or higher, while the cell was supplied with fuel and oxidizing agent.<br>
In other words, the hydrogen generating cell of Example 1 converted part of fuel into hydrogen receiving no external energy except for fuel and oxidizing agent.<br>
In addition, reforming occurred at a surprisingly low temperature of 30 to 90^C, In view of these facts, the hydrogen generating device of the invention is likely to be novel and the effect to use this package-type fuel cell power generating device incorporating the control device requiring protection from high<br><br>
heat is profound.<br>

Moreover, when the flow rate of air is in the range of 50 to 60 ml/min, hydrogen evolves most readily: when the flow rate of air is excessively large as 100 ml/min, no evolution of hydrogen is detected.<br>
Next, the cell was operated: temperature at SO^Cp flow rate of fuel at 5 ml/min; flow rate of air at 60 ml/min; and current density at 8.4 loA/cm^ to cause gas to evolve. The concentration of hydrogen in the gas was determined by gas chromatography*<br>

sufficiently high, when the temperature is at the low level tested.<br>
What is important here is that current was withdrawn outside from the hydrogen generating cells of Example 2. In other words^ the hydrogen generating cell of Example 2 converted part of fuel into hydrogen while withdrawing electric energy to outside- In addition, reforming occurred at a surprisingly low temperature of 30 to 90°C. In view of these facts, the hydrogen generating device of the invention is likely to be novel and the effect to use this hydrogen generating device in the package-type fuel cell power generating device incorporating the control device requiring protection from high heat is profound.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
Illustrative examples of the hydrogen generating device as defined by Claim 6 of the invention (charging condition) will be presented below. [Hydrogen generating example 3-1]<br>
The structure of hydrogen generating cells described in Example 3 (hydrogen generating examples 3-1 to 3-8) with a means for providing electric energy from outside is outlined in FIG,<br>
42.<br>
The hydrogen generating cells are the same in structure as those of hydrogen generating example 1-1 except that the cell comprises a fuel electrode as cathode and an oxidizing electrode as anode with a means for providing electric energy from outside.<br>
The hydrogen generating cell was placed in an electric furnace where hot air was circulated. The cell was operated while the temperature (operation temperature) being kept at 50°C with<br><br>
the flow of air to the air electrode kept at 10 to 80 ml/min and the flow of IM aqueous solution of methanol (fuel) to the fuel electrode kept at 5 ml/min. Then, while the current flowing between the air electrode and the fuel electrode being varied by means of a DC power source from outside, the operation voltage between the fuel electrode and the air electrode, the volume of gas evolved from the fuel electrode and gas composition were monitored and analyzed- The energy efficiency of charging condition was defined as a ratio of the chemical energy of hydrogen evolved to the electric energy supplied from outside. The concentration of hydrogen in the generated gas was determined by gas chromatography, and rate of hydrogen evolution also determined.<br>
The energy efficiency of a charging condition was calculated based on the following equation:<br>
Energy efficiency (%) ^   (combustion heat of H2/electric energy provided) x 100<br>
Combustion heat (kj) of H2 per minute - (rate of H2 evolution iiil/min/24.47/1000) x 286 kJ/mol [HHV]<br>
Electric energy (kJ) per minute = (voltage mV/1000 x current A X 60 sec)Wsec/1000<br>
To avoid undue misunderstanding, a few comments are added here. The object of this invention lies in obtaining hydrogen gas having a higher energy content than the electric energy supplied from outside, and the invention does not aim to gain more energy than the sum of paid energy without taking any heed to the law of conservation of energy taught by thermodynamics. When the energy balance of the entire system is taken into view, since part of organic compound-based fuel is oxidized, the energy<br><br>
expenditure includes, in addition to the electric energy supplied from outsidef the chemical energy consumed for the oxidization of the fuelr which will amount to a value equal to or less than 100%. To distinguish more clearly the inventive method from conventional methods for obtaining hydrogen via the electrolysis of water, the energy efficiency of a system defined by the ratio of the chemical energy of evolved hydrogen to the electric energy supplied from outside will be used here.<br>
Relation of the rate of hydrogen evolution with the current density applied in the test is shown in FIG. 43.<br>
It was found that the efficiency of hydrogen evolution (efficiency of hydrogen evolution relative to electric energy supplied) becomes equal to or more than 100% (100% efficiency of hydrogen evolution is represented by the dashed line in FIG. 43) in certain areas when the current density is kept not more than 40 mA/cm^. This suggests that it is possible to obtain hydrogen whose energy content is larger than the electric energy supplied from outside by operating the cell in those areas.<br>
FIG, 44 shows a graph for indicating relationship between the rate of hydrogen evolution and the operation voltage, both adapted from the results of FIG. 43.<br>
From this, it was found that the rate of hydrogen evolution (volume of hydrogen evolution) tends to depend on the operation voltage, and hydrogen evolves when the operation voltage is equal to or larger than 400 mV, and the rate of hydrogen evolution becomes virtually constant when the operation voltage becomes equal to or larger than 600 mV, and the rate of hydrogen evolution becomes larger (hydrogen is readier to evolve) with reduction of the flow rate of air*<br><br>

Next, the cell was operated under a condition of high energy efficiency (1050%) : temperature at SO'^'C; flow rate of fuel at 5 ml/min; flow rate of air at 50 ml/min; and current density at 4. 8 mA/cm^ to cause gas to evolve. The concentration of hydrogen in the gas was determined by gas chromatography. As a result it was found that the gas contained hydrogen at about 8 6%, and hydrogen evolved at a rate of 7,8 ml/min. No CO was detected. [Hydrogen generating example 3-2]<br>

case of formic acid, hydrogen was generated in a state where the open-circuit voltage was lower than that for methanol, formaldehyde- Also, the peak of hydrogen evolution rate was observed at a low open-circuit voltage (about 350 mV) for formic acid, while that of methanol, formaldehyde was about 500 mV.<br>

At the cell temperature of 50°C, the flow rate of IM aqueous solution of methanol was made at 5 ml/min to flow to the fuel electrode and the flow rate of air was made at 0 to 150 ml/min to the air electrode. Then, the open-circuit voltage of the cell and the rate of gas evolution generated from the fuel electrode were measured. The hydrogen concentration in the generated gas was analyzed by a gas chromatography and the hydrogen evolution rate was acquired.<br>
The result is shown in FIG, 73.<br>
Hydrogen was generated at the air flow rate of 30 to 130 ml/min, but the hydrogen evolution volume was lower than the case<br><br>
where the separator board is used for both the fuel electrode and the air electrode.<br>
The result of FIG- 7 3 is shown as relation of relation of the rate of hydrogen evolution with the open-circuit voltage in FIG. 74,<br>
From this, the hydrogen evolution rate (hydrogen evolution volume) shows a tendency to depend on the open-circuit voltage as that of hydrogen generating example 1-1;' and hydrogen is found to be generated at the open-circuit voltage of 400 to 600 mV, Also, the peak of the hydrogen evolution rate is observed in the vicinity of 470 mV.<br>
