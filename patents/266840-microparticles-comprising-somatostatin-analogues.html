In order to minimize the number of injections to a patient, a suitable depot formulation should be administered.<br>
It has been found that administration of micropartides comprising a somatostatin analogue e.g. embedded in a biocompatible pharmacologically acceptable polymer, suspended in a suitable vehicle gives release of all or of substantially all of the active agent over an extended period of time, e.g. several weeks up to 6 months, preferably over at least 4 weeks.<br>

The particle size distribution of the compound of the invention may influence the release profile of the drug from the microparticles. Typically, the smaller the particle size, the lower is the burst and release during the first diffusion phase, e.g. the first 20 days. Preferably, particle size distribution is e.g. x10 
The polymer matrix of the microparticles may be a synthetic.pr natural polymer. The polymer may be either a biodegradable or non-biodegradable or a combination of biodegradable and non-biodegradable polymers, preferably biodegradable.<br>

The intrinsic viscosities of star polymers of Mw 35,000 or Mw 60,000 are 0.36 or 0.51 dl/g,<br><br>
respectively, in chloroform. A star polymer having a Mw 52,000 has a viscosity of 0.475 dl/g in chloroform.<br>

For example, a mixture of polymers may comprise a polymer having a medium weight average molecular weight, e.g. from about 30,000 to about 60,000 Da, e.g. of about 50,000 Da, and of a polymer having a low weight average molecular weight, e.g. of about 2.000 to about 20,000 Da, e.g. of about 10,000 Da.<br>
Preferably, the polymer matrix comprises a linear and/or branched polylactide-co-glycolide. More preferably, the polymer matrix comprises a Resomer® RG, a star polylactide-co-glycolide polymer having a weight average molecular weight of about 10,000 Da and/or a star polylactide-co-glycolide polymer having a weight average molecular weight of about 50,000 Da. The ratio of linear to branched polylactide-co-glycolide preferably is 0 ; 100 to 100:0, e.g. 50: 50 to 25: 75.<br>

The resulting micropartides may have a diameter from a few submicrons to a few millimeters; e.g. diameters of at most about 250 microns, e.g. 10 to 200 microns, preferably 10 to 130  microns, more preferably 10 to 90 microns, even more preferably 10 to 60<br><br>
microns, are strived for, e.g. in order to facilitate passage through an injection needle. A narrow particle size distribution is preferred. For example the particle size distribution may be e.g. x10

The microparticles in dry state may e.g. be mixed, e.g. coated, with an anthagglomerating agent, or e.g. covered by a layer of an anti-agglomerating agent e.g. in a prefilled syringe or vial.<br>
Suitable anti-agglomerating agents include e.g. mannitol, glucose, dextrose, sucrose, sodium chloride, or water soluble polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone or polyethylene glycol, e.g. with the properties described above.<br>
Preferably, an anti-agglomerating agent is present in an amount of about 0.1 to about 10%, e.g. about 4% by weight of the microparticles.<br>
Prior to administration, the microparticles are suspended in a vehicle suitable for injection.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention further provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising microparticles of the invention in a vehicle. The vehicle may optionally further contain: a) one or more wetting agents; and/or b) one or more tonicity agent; and/or c) one or more viscosity increasing agents.<br>
Preferably, the vehicle is water based, e.g. it may contain water, e.g deionized, and optionally a buffer to adjust the pH to 7-7,5, e.g. a phosphate buffer such as a mixture of Na2HPO4 and KH2PO4, and one or more of agents a), b) and/or c) as indicated above.<br>
However, when using water as a vehicle, the microparticles of the invention may not suspend and may float on the top of the aqueous phase. In order to improve the capacity of the microparticles of the invention to be suspended in an aqueous medium, the vehicle preferably comprises a wetting agent a). The wetting agent is chosen to allow a quick and suitable suspendibility of the microparticles in the vehicle. Preferably, the microparticles are quickly wettened by the vehicle and quickly form a suspension therein.<br>
Suitable wetting agents for suspending the microparticles of the invention in a water-based vehicle include non-ionic surfactants such as poloxamers, or polyoxyethylene-sorbitan-fatty acid esters, the characteristics of which have been described above. A mixture of wetting<br><br>
agents may be used. Preferably, the wetting agent comprises Pluronic F68, Tween 20 and/or Tween 80.<br>
The wetting agent or agents may be present in about 0.01 to about 1% by weight of the composition to be administered, preferably from 0.01 to 0.5% and may be present in about 0.01 to 5 mg/ml of the vehicle, e.g. about 2 mg/ml.<br>
Preferably, the vehicle further comprises a tonicity agent b) such as mannitol, sodium chloride, glucose, dextrose, sucrose, or glycerin. Preferably, the tonicity agent is mannitol.<br>
The amount of tonicity agent is chosen to adjust the isotonicity of the composition to be administered. In case a tonicity agent is contained in the microparticles, e.g. to reduce agglomeration as mentioned above, the amount of tonicity agent is to be understood as the sum of both. For example, mannitol preferably may be from about 1% to about 5% by weight of the composition to be administered, preferably about 4.5%.<br>
Preferably, the vehicle further comprises a viscosity increasing agent c). Suitable viscosity increasing agents include carboxymethyl cellulose sodium (CMC-Na), sorbitol, polyvinyl-pyrrolidone, or aluminium monostearate.<br>
CMC-Na with a low viscosity may conveniently be used. Embodiments may be as described above. Typically, a CMC-Na with a low molecular weight is used. The viscosity may be of from about 1 to about 30 mPa s. e.g. from about 10 to about 15 mPa s when measured as a 1% (w/v) aqueous solution at 25°C in a Brookfield LVT viscometer with a spindle 1 at 60 rpm, or a viscosity of 1 to 15 mPa*s for a solution of NaCMC 7LF (low molecular weight) as a 0.1 to 1% solution in water.<br>
A polyvinylpyrrolidone having properties as described above may be used.<br>
A viscosity increasing agent, e.g. CMC-Na, may be present in an amount of from about 0.1 to about 2%, e.g. about 0.7% or about 1.75% of the vehicle (by volume), e.g. in a concentration of about 1 to about 30 mg/ml in the vehicle, e.g. about 7 mg/ml or about 17.5 mg/ml.<br>
In a further aspect, the present invention provides a kit comprising microparticles of the invention and a vehicle of the invention. For example, the kit may comprise microparticles comprising the exact amount of compound of the invention to be administered, e.g. as described below, and about 1 to about 5 ml, e.g. about 2 ml of the vehicle of the invention.<br><br>
In one embodiment, the dry micropartides, optionally in admixture with an anti-agglomerating agent, may be filled into a container, e.g. a vial or a syringe, and sterilized e.g. using γ-irradition. Prior to administration, the micropartides may be suspended in the container by adding a suitable vehicle, e.g. the vehicle described above. For example, the micropartides, optionally in admixture with an anti-agglomerating agent, a viscosity increasing agent and/or a tonicity agent, and the vehide for suspension may be housed separately in a double chamber syringe. A mixture of the micropartides with an anti aggtomerating agent anflior a viscosity increasing agent and/or a tonicity agent, also forms part of the invention.<br>
In another embodiment, under sterile conditions dry sterilized microparticles, optionally in admixture with an anti-agglomerating agent, may be suspended in a suitable vehide, e.g. the vehicle described above, and filled into a container, e.g. a vial or a syringe. The solvent of the vehicle, e.g. the water, may then be removed, e.g. by freeze-drying or evaporation under vacuum, leading to a mixture of the micropartides and the solid components of the vehicle in the container. Prior to administration, the microparticles and solid components of the vehicle may be suspended in the container by adding a suitable vehicle, e,g, water, e.g. water for infusion, or preferably a low molarity phosphate buffer solution. For example, the mixture of the microparticles, optionally the anti-agglomerating agent, and solid components of the vehicle and the vehicle for suspension, e.g. water, may be housed separately in a double chamber syringe.<br>
