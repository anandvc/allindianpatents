				<td>Present invention relates to a safety valve in a stove.<br>
Prior art<br>
Kerosene oil based stoves are very common in use in lower and middle strata of society and very small-scale industries. But in spite of this no safety provision has been provided in pressure stoves and some times because of more air pressure created due to more amount of air pumped in these pressure stoves oil tank burst out and many people die. Generally while using pressure stoves if the flame is burning at a low speed then more amount of air is pumped inside pressure stoves, oil burns in pressure stoves at a more pace. But if the pipe or burner is blocked because of some impurities, 'sediments then still oil will burn at a lower pace, but user does not recognize this problem and keeps on continuously pumping air inside the stove, after some time pressure level rises so high in the oil tank that tank bursts and moreover this bursting oil from tank gets flame from the burner and generally an explosion occurs.<br>
Now this invention provides a safety valve, which will be placed at existing stoves on a particular location or preferably at the hole from where oil is filled inside stove. In existing stoves this hole is covered by a cap and with the knob of this cap pressure is released. This existing cap can be replaced with proposed safety valve with or without any modification instead of existing caps. This safety valve will be made up from many materials like aluminum, brass, steel, rubber, plastic.<br>
Advantages over prior art<br>
One of the objects of the invention is to provide safety to users;<br>
Another object of the invention is to make this safety valve at an affordable price so users can easily adopt this, which is made possible because of its simple construction.<br>
Another object of the invention is to make this safety valve so compatible, so that users who are already using pressure stoves can also adopt this without any major changes.<br>
Another object of the invention is to make this safety valve, so that it can be used without any modification in pressure lamps.<br>
Statement of the invention:<br>
A safety valve in a stove comprising:<br>
an annular metallic pipe (A) having hole (F) with threads (B) at its rear end; t         an annular metallic cover (C) having hole (D) being tightened by threads with said metallic pipe (A) at its rear end and being tightened by threads with the threads being provided on stove at a location from where oil is filled;<br>
said metallic cover(C) having metallic projections (O), so as to grip the metallic cover;<br>
rubber gaskets being provided on upward and downward of said metallic cover so as to avoid leakage of air;v<br>
an annular weight (G) having inner diameter greater than outer diameter of said metallic pipe by (0.5-1.5) mm, being provided with plurality of holes at its periphery;<br>
an annular plastic cover (N);<br>
a metallic pin (H) with a sharp rear end (L) and threaded portion (K) having a size equal to inside diameter of said annular plastic cover;<br>
said threads (K) of said metallic pin (H) ofrs. u^ tightened on said annular weight (G).<br>
Brief description of the accompanying drawings:<br>
Further features &amp;advantages of the invention become clear from the following description &amp;drawings<br>
Fig1: Perspective view showing various components of the safety valve Fig2: Perspective view safety valve as an assembly.<br>
1.Annular metallic pipe	(A)	Al, Brass, etc.<br>
2.	Annular metallic cover	(c)	Al, Brass, etc.<br>
3.	Annular weight	(G)	Al, Steel Brass, etc.<br>
4.Mettalic pin	(h)	Al, Brass, etc<br>
5. Annular plastic cover	(N)	Plastic<br>
6.Rubber Gaskets	(D)	Rubber<br>
Detailed description:<br>
The nature of the invention, its objective and further advantages residing in the same will be apparent from the following description made with reference to the non-limiting exemplary embodiment of the invention represented in the accompanying drawings.<br>
As shown in fig. 1 the safety valve for a pressure stove comprises various metallic and non-metallic components. An annular metallic pipe (A) having hole (F) running throughout its whole length has threads (B) at its rear end.<br>
An annular metallic cover (C) is having hole (D) running throughout its whole length. This annular metallic cover (C) is being tightened by threads with said metallic pipe (A) at its rear end and being tightened by threads with the threads being provided on stove at a location, preferably from where oil is filled.<br>
Said metallic cover(C) is having metallic projections (O), at its periphery, so as to grip the metallic cover; so that whenever safety valve is to be tightened on the stove valve can be rotated by gripping projections, moreover in the event of removal of safety valve from stove these projections can be rotated in reverse direction as from above.<br>
Rubber gaskets are being provided on upward and downward of said metallic cover(C) so as to avoid any leakage of air.<br>
An annular weight (G) is having inner diameter greater than outer diameter of said metallic pipe by (0.5-1.5) mm, is being provided with plurality of holes at its periphery;<br>
An annular plastic cover(N) is separately attached to said annular valve.A   metallic pin(H) which is having a   sharp rear end (L) and   threaded portion (K) is having a size equal to inside diameter of said annular plastic cover;<br>
These said threads (K) of said metallic pin (H) can be tightened on said annular weight(G).ln fact this metallic pin attaches the plastic cover with the said metallic pin.In another embodiment of the invention number of washers which can act as weights are provided on the pin , so that depending on the size of the pressure stove annular weight can be increased or decreased. In another embodiment this annular weight can be made in bigger or smaller sizes as per the size of the pressure stove, so that larger volume stoves are provided with bigger weights and smaller volume cylinders are provided with smaller weights. This pressure stove working can , be better understood after reading the flow path of air, In normal situations pressure of the air is balanced by the annular weight, now as more air is pumped inside the stove then the excess air exits out from hole (M) after passing successively through hole(D), hole(F),hole (I) and finally through holes (M), which are uncovered as the pin leaves the plastic cover.<br>
As shown in fig. 2;assembled safety valve will be made up of 2 main parts. First part being weight (P) on which pin(H) is tightened to plastic cover(N) and second part being a metallic rod (A)being tightened to a metallic cover(C) which will be tightened while gripping metallic projections on the stove at a location preferably from where oil is filled , in the stove.<br>
Procedure: This safety valve works on weight balancing .In normal mode a<br>
s<br>
predetermined weight made from metal is balanced with an equal pressure created due to air. Normally when air is pumped inside stove pressure increases, in the stove. When this pressure reaches a particular limit, weight leaves it normal seat; and for releasing air pressure air ejects out from the opening provided in the weights. In normal functioning these openings, which are provided in weight, are covered with a plastic cover. Moreover in the event of stoppage of stove this safety valve will have to be displaced from its normal position i.e. weight will be lifted until when whole amount of air 4h. the stove ejects out causing flame to extinguish . This leads to a safe working of stove.<br>
It will be evident to those skilled in the art that the invention is not limited to the details of the foregoing illustrated embodiments and that the present invention may be smbodied in other specific forms without departing from the spirit or essential attributes :hereof. The present embodiments are therefore to be considered in all respects as llustrative and not restrictive, the scope of invention being indicated by the appended claims rather than by the foregoing description, and all changes which come within the neaning and range of equivalency of the claims are therefore intended to be embraced herein.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
