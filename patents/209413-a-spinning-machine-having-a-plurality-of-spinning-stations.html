BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
The present invention relates to a spinning machine having a plurality of spinning stations, which each have an arrangement for condensing a drafted fibre strand, which arrangement comprises a transport surface for guiding the fibre strand over a suction slit of a suction device.<br>
A spinning machine of this type is prior art for example in US patent 5,600,872. In the case of such spinning machines a central suction channel is provided, which extends over all spinning stations, whereby a suction connection is arranged to each arrangement for condensing. In particular in the case of long spinning machines, there is the risk that the vacuum at those spinning stations which are further away from the vacuum generating fan falls off, resulting in differences in quality of the yarns to be spun.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to avoid inadmissable differences in underpressure and thus to avoid differences in yarn quality.<br>
This object has been achieved in accordance with the present invention in that a plurality of suction devices, each arranged to a plurality of spinning stations are provided, a fan being arranged to each of the suction devices.<br>
The suction devices can be arranged to a higher or lower number of spinning stations, according to the size of the fans or the form of the spinning machine. As a result of the short path from each fan to the individual spinning stations, throttling losses and underpressure differences are minimized. Thus differences in quality in the yam to be spun can be reduced to a permissible level.<br>
For the purpose of the present invention, each suction device including its fan is arranged to a plurality of spinning stations of both machine sides. For example, a joint fan can be arranged to eight spinning stations of each machine side.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the suction devices comprise hollow profiles, which are provided with suction slits according to the number of spinning stations arranged thereto, said hollow profiles serving as sliding guides for sieve belts comprising the transport surfaces.<br><br>
- 3-<br>
According to the number of suction devices, including the fan, which are present, so is a hollow profile arranged to the same number of spinning stations, said hollow profile having for each spinning station a suction slit, but for all spinning stations arranged thereto only one suction opening, which can be connected to a suction tube of the suction device.<br>
The hollow profile, extending along a plurality of spinning stations, can be sealed clamped onto the respective suction tube by means of a snap lock. This serves in particular the exchange of a sieve belt when it is worn.<br>
In a further embodiment of the present invention, a joint used-air channel is arranged to all the suction devices. This ensures that the unavoidable suctioned-off fibre fly on the condensing arrangements does not reach the individual components of the spinning machine.<br>
In order to monitor the vacuum, and thus the yarn quality, a pressure measuring device can be arranged to each suction tube. The vacuum can be regulated for the purpose of the invention. In the case of a malfunction, the relevant machine section is shut down.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
These and further objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more readily apparent from the following detailed description thereof when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings wherein:<br>

- 4 -<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
The spinning machine shown in the Figures 1 to 4 is preferably, but not necessarily a ring spinning machine. On each of the two machine sides 1 and 2, a plurality of spinning stations 3 are arranged in a row adjacently to one another. Each spinning station 3 comprises preferably a spindle 4, which can be designed as a ring spindle. To a certain number of spinning stations 3 a suction device 5 or 6 is arranged, whose function is described below.<br>
Refering to Figures 1 and 2, a drafting unit 7 for each spinning station 3 can be seen, of which drafting unit 7 only the front roller pair 8 as well as the apron roller pair 9 arranged upstream thereof are shown. In the drafting unit 7, a sliver or a roving 10 is drafted to a desired fineness in a known way. The ready drafted fibre strand 11 is pneumatically condensed in an arrangement 12 directly downstream of the drafting unit 7, which results in an improved cross sectional utilization and to reduced hairiness of the thread 13 to be spun, which becomes more tear resistant and more even. Downstream of the arrangement 12, the thread 13 to be twisted travels according to the denoted arrow direction to a respective spindle 4.<br>
A hollow profile 14 or 15 is arranged to a plurality of spinning stations 3, for example a section of eight spinning stations 3, which hollow profile 14 or 15 is a component part of the arrangement 12 for condensing as well as the suction devices 5 or 6. In this case, a low-friction profile of light metal or stainless steel can be involved, or alternatively a slideable plastic profile having a high wear resistance. This hollow profile 14 or 15 is closed on all sides, except for the openings which are described below, and is subject to a vacuum. Each hollow profile 14,15 is supported at its ends in a way described below in roller stands 16,17, in which the bottom cylinders of the drafting unit 7 are also supported.<br>
The hollow profile 14 or 15 is designed as a sliding guide for a plurality of sieve belts 18, of which one each is arranged to a spinning station 3. Two hollow profiles 14 disposed opposite one another of two different machine sides 1 and 2 belong to a joint suction device 5 or 6. In the case of the sieve belt 18, a very fine woven belt having an extremely fine perforation is involved, whereby the sieve belt 18 is air permeable. It serves as a transport surface for the fibre strand 11 to be condensed.<br>
At a distance from the front roller pair 8, for example at a distance corresponding to the staple length, each sieve belt 18 is pressed against the hollow profile 14 by means of a driven nipping roller 19. A relatively low pressure of, for example, 20 Newton is sufficient for this purpose. The<br><br>
- 5-<br>
sieve belt 18 is driven thus in a sliding manner relating to the hollow profile 14, and the sieve belt 18 in turn transports the drafted fibre strand 11.<br>
The drive of the nipping roller 19 is derived from the front top roller 20 of the front roller pair 8. By means of a transfer roller 21, which is disposed by means of friction on the front top roller 20 on the one hand and on the nipping roller 19 on the other hand, the fibre strand 11 to be condensed attains approximately the same speed as at the nipping tine of the front roller pair 8. A slight tension draft can be obtained by choosing a relevant friction diameter.<br>
The front rop roller 20 as well as the nipping roller 19 are arranged in a rocker 22, which is loaded by means of a loading spring 23 of the top weighting arm 24. The corresponding geometry ensures that the loading of the front top roller 20 is higher than the loading of the nipping roller 19.<br>
According to the number of spinning stations 3, to which a hollow profile 14 or 15 is arranged, the hollow profile 14 comprises a number of suction slits 25, which are each covered by a sieve belt 18. The suction slits 25 begin directly downstream of the nipping line of the front roller pair 8 and extend to the nipping line of the nipping roller 19. The suction slits 25 extends at an angle of approximately 20° transversely to the transport direction, so that the drafted fibre strand 11 transported over the suction slit 25 is imparted a slight false twist, which supports the condensing effect.<br>
A suction opening 26 is arranged to each hollow profile 14 or 15 approximately in the centre between the roller stands 16 and 17, which suction opening 26 is connected to a vacuum source. Only one single suction opening 26 is present per hollow profile 14 or 15. Each suction opening 26 can be connected in a sealed way to a suction tube 27 or 28. The hollow profile 14 is applied in a releasable way at the separation point between the suction opening 26 of the hollow profile 14 and the respective suction tube 27 or 28, in a way to be described below.<br>
A pressure measuring device for monitoring the vacuum necessary for spinning is arranged to each suction tube 27,28.<br>
A fan 30 or 31 is arranged to each suction device 5 or 6, so that one fan 30,31 is present per machine section. The fan 30,31 is however advantageously arranged to both machine sides 1 and 2 jointly, so that also two hollow profiles 14 and 15 are arranged to one fan 30 or 31. The used air of the individual fans 30,31 as well as further fans (not shown) is fed into a joint used-air channel 32, which advantageously extends in the centre plane along the length of the entire<br><br>
- 6-<br>
spinning machine. This prevents fibre fly suctioned at the transport surface of the sieve belt 18 from reaching any components of the machine.<br>
As denoted only in Figure 1, and dearly seen in Figure 3, each hollow profile 14,15 is supported in the respective roller stands 16 and 17 by means of snap locks 33 applied to its ends. In Figure 3, the end of a roller stand 16 as well as the sieve belt 18, shown separately, of a spinning station 3 can be clearly seen. The roller stands 16,17 are provided with corresponding take-ups 34 having rectangular cross-sections, which take the form of recesses open at the top and in which corresponding holding pegs 35 are inserted, which are located at the ends of the hollow profiles 14,15. The holding pegs 35 are matched to the contour of the take-ups 34, said holding pegs 35 being oval or half-cylindrical in shape at their ends. By means of a clamping lever 36 the hollow profiles 14,15 can be fixed by means of their holding pegs 35 in the take-ups 34 of the roller stands 16,17.<br>
The individual clamping levers 36 can be swivelled around a swivel axle 37 of the respective roller stand 16,17 until they reach a limit stop 41. The disengaged position 38 of the clamping lever 36 is denoted by a dot-dash line. The clamping surface 39 can be seen with which the clamping lever 36 is disposed over the corresponding contour of the holding peg 35 when engaging. Self-locking thus occurs.<br>
The snap-locks 33 serve the rapid exchange of a hollow profile 14 or 15, when, for example, a sieve belt 18 of a spinning station 3 is worn or defect. In order to replace a sieve belt 18, the clamping lever 36 is guided over into its disengaged position 38, so that the relevant hollow profile 14 or 15 can be removed upwards out of the take-up 34 of the respective roller stands 16 and 17. The old sieve belt 18 can now be easily replaced by a new sieve belt 18. The hollow profile 14,15 is inserted again into the roller stands 16 and 17 and locked by means of the clamping lever 36.<br>
In Figure 4, it is shown schematically and in reduced scale how a suction device 5 or 6 is arranged to a plurality of spinning stations 3. Each suction device 5,6 is connected to two hollow profiles 14 or 15 disposed opposite on different machine sides 1,2.<br>
The suction openings 26, the suction tubes 27,28, the fans 30,31 as well as the used-air channel 32 can be seen in Figure 4. In addition, a small electric motor 40 is arranged to each fan 30,31. Alternatively, all fans 30,31 can be driven by a continuous drive shaft extending in machine longitudinal direction.<br><br>
- 7 -<br>
As can be seen, one suction device 5 or 6 is arranged to each section of eight spinning stations 3 per machine side 1 and 2. By means of this distribution, the vacuum can be homogenized along the spinning stations 3, in particular in the case of long spinning machines. It is not then necessary to provide a separate vacuum channel having particularly large dimensions for the arrangement 12 for condensing of the drafted fibre strand 11.<br><br>
