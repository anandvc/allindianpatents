A VEHICULAR HANDLEBAR SWITCH STRUCTURE<br>
HONDA GIKEN KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA, a corporation of Japan, having a place of business at 1-1, Minamiaoyama 2-chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
ORIGINAL <br>

The present invention relates to a vehicular handlebar switch structure.<br>
[Detailed Description of the Invention]<br>
[0001].		"<br>
[Technical Field of the Invention]<br>
The present invention relates to a bar handle switch,<br>
structure specifically suitable for motorcycle.<br>
[0002]	<br>
[Description of the Related Art]<br>
For example, in Fig. 15 of Japanese Patent Laid-Open No.310172/1999, entitled "STRUCTURE OF FRONT FLASHER LAMP SECTION IN A SCOOTER TYPE VEHICLE", a structure in which a bar handle 18 (the reference numerals shown here are those used in the same publication) is covered by a handle cover 19, and left and right switch cases (no reference numeral is designated) independent of the handle cover 19 are arranged on both sides of the handle cover 19, and these switch cases are provided with switches (no reference numeral is designated) is shown. In other words, the structure in which the left and right switch cases are provided independently of the handle cover to give them prominence and simultaneously the handle cover is miniaturized is known in the related art. [0003] [Problems to be Solved by the Invention]<br><br>
However, because the left and right switch cases are provided independently of the handle cover, the setting of the clearance between the handle cover and the switch case is difficult, and thus the left and right clearances may easily be unequal. Though it is important to set the clearances equally for maintaining a good appearance, the left and right clearances are easily be unequal in the structure of the related art. Therefore, it is necessary to take a time for adjustment of the clearance, and thus the number of steps for assembly increases.<br>
In other words, the structure in the related art has problems in that the appearance may be deteriorated, or it requires more number of steps for assembly.<br>
[0004] [Means for Solving the Problems]<br>
In order to solve the problem described above, the invention according to Claim 1 is a structure in which the left and the right switch cases are connected by a bridge portion integrally formed with the switch case, and the switch case is provided on the left and right of the handle cover with the switch cases visually exposed so that the bridge portion is covered with the handle cover.<br>
Since the left and right switch cases are connected by the bridge portion, the clearances between the switch cases and the handle cover may be set quite easily, and thus the number<br><br>
of the steps for assembly may be reduced while improving appearance.<br>
[0005]<br>
The invention according to Claim 2 is characterized in that a connecting point is provided on the switch case for connecting to each switch, and a harness extending from the connecting point is embedded in the bridge portion.<br>
Since the switches can be mounted on the switch case only by being inserted into the connecting point provided on the switch case, and the harness is embedded in the bridge portion, wiring operation for mounting switches is not necessary, and thus the number of steps for mounting switches may be significantly reduced.<br>
[0006]<br>
The invention according to Claim 3 is characterized in that a terminal recess for accommodating an external connecting terminal for being electrically connected with the outside is provided, an air vent in communication with the outside is formed on the back wall of the recess, and the other end of the harness is connected to the external connecting terminal.<br>
The external connecting terminal may easily get wet by drops of water entering from the outside. When it is left untreated, the conductivity may be lowered due to generation of rust. Therefore, it is constructed in such a manner that moisture is discharged through the air vent, and the external<br><br>
connecting terminal is kept in the dried condition.<br>
[0007]<br>
The invention according to Claim 4 is characterized in that a shade is integrally formed with the bridge portion for preventing rainwater from entering into the terminal recess from the opening of the air vent.<br>
There is a possibility that rainwater flows upstream through the air vent and enters into the terminal recess depending on the structure of the handle cover. Therefore, the shade is constructed in such a manner that it blocks rainwater that may flow toward the air vent. As a consequent, there is no more possibility that water flow upstream through the air vent and thus the terminal recess can be kept in the dried state.<br><br><br>

[0008] [Description of the Embodiments]<br>
Referring now to the attached drawings, an embodiment of the present invention will be described below. The drawings are to be viewed so that the reference numerals can be seen in the right direction.<br>
Fig. 1 is a plan view of a switch case aggregate which is a principal member of the present invention, in which the switch case aggregate 10 is constructed by connecting a left and a right switch cases 11L, 11R (L, R represent the left and the right viewed from the deriver) with a bridge portion 12,<br><br>
and more specifically, they are integrally formed at the time of molding. The reference numeral 13 denotes an external connecting terminal, the reference numeral 14 denotes a shade, and these external connecting terminal 13 and the shade 14 are also formed integrally with bridge portion 12 at the time of molding.<br>
[0009]<br>
Fig. 2 is a view seen in the direction of the arrow 2 in Fig. 1, or a drawing showing the surface facing toward the driver, in which the right switch case 11R is formed with an upper right recess 15 and a lower right recess 16, and a terminal pin 17 for an idling stop switch is formed in the upper right recess 15 uprisingly toward the front surface of the drawing at the time of molding, and a terminal pin 18 for a cell switch is formed in the lower right recess 16 uprisingly toward the front surface of the drawing at the time of molding. The terminal pins 17, 18 are one of the modes of the connecting point.<br>
[0010]<br>
In the same manner, the left switch case 11L is formed with an upper left recess 21 and the middle left recess 22 and a lower left recess 23, and a terminal pin 24 for a lamp H/L changeover switch is formed in the upper left recess 21 uprisingly therefrom, a terminal pin 25 for a turn signal changeover switch is formed in the middle left recess 22<br><br>
uprisingly therefrom, and a terminal pin 26 for horn switch is formed in the lower left recess 23 uprisingly therefrom all at the time of molding. The terminal pins 24-26 are also one of the modes of the connecting point.<br>
[0011]<br>
The bridge portion 12 has such a configuration that the medium width portion 28 extends leftward from the wide portion 27 in the middle, and a narrow portion 29 extends rightward as shown in the figure, and such variations in width is determined considering the number of harness described later.<br>
The figure shows that the wide portion 27 in the middle is formed with an air vent 31 extending therethrough in the direction vertical to the surface of the drawing, and a shade 14 in the shape of a channel opening downward covers on the air vent 31 just like a window roof. The shade 14 is, as shown in Fig. 2, sufficiently long.<br>
[0012]<br>
The reference numeral 32 ... (.. .represents that there are a plurality of those, hereinafter) denote bolt holes, which are to be used for connecting the switch case aggregate 10 to the handle covers or the like.<br>
[0013]<br>
Fig. 3 is a view seen in the direction of arrow 3 in Fig. 1, and corresponds to the switch case aggregate 10 in Fig. 2 in the inverted state. The external connecting terminal 13<br><br>
integrally provided at the center of the bridge portion 12 comprises a rectangular shaped terminal recess 34, an uprising terminal pin 35, and a locking claw 36. The terminal pin 35 shows one of the modes of the external connecting terminal.<br>
[0014]<br>
The locking claw 36 is a claw formed concurrently at the time of molding for preventing the coupler (shown by the reference numeral 52 in Fig. 9) from being detached. When such a locking claw 36 is formed concurrently, a problem of undercut occurs and thus it is necessary to exercise ingenuity in molding. It is achieved by inserting a mobile pin called slide core in the cavity of resinous die, and pulling out the mobile pin before opening the die to enable the die to be opened. Therefore, the hole inevitably made by pulling the mobile pin out is utilized to form the air vent 31 shown in Fig. 2.<br>
[0015]<br>
Fig. 4 is an explanatory drawing of a layout of the harness according to the present invention, showing that a bundle of harness 40 for the lamp H/L changeover switch 37, a turn signal changeover switch 38, and a horn switch 3 9 shown on the right side in the figure is extended from the terminal pin 35 of the external connecting terminal 13, and the terminal pins 24, 25, 26 are individually connected to the tip of the harness 40.<br>
In the same manner, a bundle of harness 43 for the idling stop switch 41 and the cell switch 42 shown on the left side<br><br>
of the figure is extended, and the terminal pins 17, 18 are individually connected to the tip of the harness 43.<br>
[0016]<br>
What is important here is that the bundles of harness 40, 43 and their terminal pins 35, 17, 18, 24, 25, and 2 6 on both ends are molded, or in other words, the harnesses 40, 43 are embedded in the switch case aggregate 10 by setting them in the molding die and then pouring resin therein.<br>
[0017]<br>
Fig. 5 is a cross sectional view taken along the line A-A in Fig. 1, showing that electrical connection is established by fitting the idling stop switch 41 on the terminal pin 17.<br>
Fig. 6 is a cross sectional view taken along the line B-B in Fig. 2 showing that electrical connection is established by fitting the cell switch 42 on the terminal pin 18.<br>
Fig. 7 is a cross sectional view taken along the line C-C in Fig. 2 showing that electrical connection is established by fitting the lamp H/L changeover switch 3 7 on the terminal pin 24, and the turn signal changeover switch 38 is fitted on the terminal pin 25, and the horn switch 39 is fitted on the terminal pin 26.<br>
In this way, according to the present invention, what has to be done at the time of assembly is only to fit the switches 37, 38, 39 on the terminal pins 24, 25, 26, and troublesome<br><br><br>
wiring operation may be omitted. In addition, the switches can be sub-assembled in the switch case in advance, and thus the wiring operation of the switches may be reliably made irrespective of the handle cover.<br>
[0018]<br>
Fig. 8 is a drawing showing the switch case aggregate according to the present invention mounted on the rear handle cover. The switch case aggregate 10 is placed on the rear handle cover 44, alignment is made (for example, making alignment by aligning the positioning point marked on the switch case aggregate 10 with the reference point marked on the rear handle cover 44), and both members are joined with screws 45....<br>
[0019]<br>
Fig. 9 is a drawing showing the rear handle cover according to the present invention mounted on the bar handle, and showing a view seen from the head lamp side as in the case of Fig. 8. The rear handle cover 44 (including the switch case aggregate 10 shown in Fig. 8) is mounted on the bar handle 48 provided with the left and the right grips 46L, 46R and the left and the right brake levers 47L, 47R with the screws 49, 49 and 51, 51.<br>
When the coupler 52 is fitted on the external connecting terminal 13, electrical connection with the external harness 53 is established.<br><br><br>
[0020]<br>
Fig. 10 is a front view of the bar handle switch structure according to the present invention, which corresponds to that shown in Fig. 9 in the inverted state.<br>
The figure shows that the left and the right switch case 11L, 11R are located at both ends of the rear handle cover 44 including a meter 54 and a label 55, and the clearance tl between the left switch case 11L and the rear handle cover 44 and the clearance t2 between the right switch case 11R and the rear handle cover 44 are equalized. It is because the alignment of the left and the right switch cases 11L, 11R with respect to the rear handle cover 44 was made easily and satisfactorily in the stage shown in Fig. 8.<br>
[0021]<br>
Fig. 11 is a plan view of the bar handle switch structure according to the present invention, showing that the handle cover 58 is completed by mating the front handle cover 57 including the head lamp 56 with the rear handle cover 44. In this figure as well, the good appearance in layout of the rear handle cover 44 and the switch cases 11L, 11R may be realized by equalizing the left and the right clearances tl, t2.<br>
As is clear in Fig. 10 and Fig. 11, the switch cases and the switches provided thereon can be highlighted by changing the color tone of the switch cases 11L, 11R with respect to the handle cover.<br><br>
[0022]<br>
Though the handle cover 5 8 employed in the embodiment above is divided into the front half and the rear half, it may be undivided cover or multi-divided cover divided into at least three pieces.<br>
The connecting point or the external connecting terminal may be a female terminal, and not limited to the terminal pin shown as an example.<br>
[0023] [Advantages]<br>
The present invention achieves the following effects by the construction described above.<br>
The invention according to Claim 1is characterized in that the left and the right switch cases are connected by a bridge portion integrally formed with the switch case, and the bridge portion is covered by the handle cover. Therefore, since the left and the right switch cases are connected by the bridge portion, the clearances between the handle cases and the handle cover may be set quite easily, and thus the number of the steps for assembly may be reduced while improving appearance.<br>
[0024]<br>
The invention according to Claim 2 is characterized in that a connecting point is provided on the switch case for connecting to each switch, and a harness extending from the<br><br>
connecting point is embedded in the bridge portion, and the switches can be mounted on the switch case only by being inserted into the connecting point provided on the switch case, and the harness is embedded in the bridge portion. Therefore, wiring operation for mounting switches is not necessary, and thus the number of steps for mounting switches may be significantly reduced.<br>
[0025]<br>
The invention according to Claim 3 is characterized in<br><br>
that a terminal recess for accommodating an external connecting terminal which is to be electrically connected with the outside is provided on the bridge portion, an air vent in communication with the outside is formed on the back wall of the recess, and the other end of the harness is connected to the external connecting terminal. Therefore, water trapped in the terminal recess may be discharged through the air vent, and thus the external connecting terminal can be kept in the dried state.<br>
[0026]<br>
The invention according to Claim 4 is characterized in<br>
that a shade is integrally formed with the bridge portion for preventing rainwater from entering into the terminal recess from the opening of the air vent. Therefore, even if rainwater entered through the clearance at the handle cover, the shade can block the rainwater.<br><br><br>
