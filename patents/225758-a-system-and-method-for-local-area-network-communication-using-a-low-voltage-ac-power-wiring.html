				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a system and method for local area network communication using a low voltage AC power wiring.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In-building LANs are commonly implemented over twisted-pair cabling using the IEEE 802.3 access method and physical layer specification.<br>
Using this method, one or more hubs or switches are installed in centralized location (s) in the building, typically a wiring closet. Twisted-pair cabling is run from this closet to each user location, one cable per user. All hubs/switches are then connected together using the same type cable.<br>
One advantage of this wired method is twisted-pair cabling provides a reliable communications medium capable of rejecting external interference. Another advantage is each user can use the full capacity of the medium without having to share it with others, provided switches are used as the interconnects.<br>
The main disadvantage of twisted-pair cabling is the expense of the cable installation. If the cabling is installed at the time of building construction, the task is fairly straightforward. However, many existing buildings did not have this cabling installed at the time of construction. Retro- fitting these buildings can be a prohibitively large and complex task<br><br>
[0005]	In situations where twisted-pair cable installation is not practical,<br>
PLC is an attractive alternative. The Power Line as a communications medium presents challenges to the system designer, including impedances that vary with frequency and time, and noise sources from appliances connected to the network. It has been shown, however, that advanced modulation techniques such as Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) along with error control coding can overcome these challenges and make low-voltage AC power lines usable as a communications channel using the relatively quiet spectrum above 1 MHz.<br>
[0006]	Figure 1 depicts an example of a typical electrical wiring<br>
installation for a small to medium size commercial building. The thick lines<br>
represent high-current 3-phase wiring and the thin lines represent lower<br>
current (15-20A) wiring. The shaded boxes represent outlets, which are the<br>
locations at which users can access the network via a UT.<br>
[0007]	At the frequencies of interest to PLC, this wiring network does<br>
not present a controlled impedance, impedance discontinuities exist at every<br>
wire termination point, including outlets and panel connections. As an<br>
example, the path between outlet A and outlet B contains 9 impedance<br>
discontinuities (Ai, Aa, A3, Sub Panel 1, Main Panel, Sub Panel 2, 63, 62, 61).<br>
Upon reaching each one of these discontinuities, some signal power is<br>
reflected back toward the transmitter and impairs the channel.<br>
[0008]	The electrical panels introduce another mechanism to impair the<br>
channel. When a signal encounters a panel, some power flows out through each wire connected to the panel. In this way, the panel acts as a power<br>
divider. The panel attenuates the signal because only a fraction of the power<br>
sent into the panel goes toward the intended destination. The rest of the power is effectively lost.<br>
[0009]	It can be seen that a user on a subpanel 1 outlet attempting to<br>
communicate directly with a user on a subpanel 2 outlet encounters a number<br>
of channel impairments. As an example, the path from outlet A, to outlet B,<br>
contains 9 separate sources of channel impairment. 6 of these are outlet<br>
terminations, which mainly insert impedance discontinuities. The other 3 are<br>
panels which insert attenuation in addition to impedance discontinuities.<br>
[0010]	Whereas in the electrical installation depicted in Figure 1 uses<br>
120V/220V wiring to distribute electrical power within the building, it is also common to use a higher voltage such as 480V for long high-power runs and then step down to 120V for local distribution. The higher voltage reduces the current which allows use of a smaller-gauge wire. Figure 2 depicts such an installation. The power transformers commonly used in these applications present a significant barrier for signals in the PLC frequency range, further decreasing the likelyhood that a node can directly communicate with a node on a different subpanel.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0011]	The invention is a network topology and packet routing method<br>
for providing LAN connectivity over in-building AC power wiring. The network consists of one or more APs, one or more UTs, and the power wiring (the medium). The AP(s) is (are) installed in locations representing the logical center of the entire in-building wiring network or the center of a portion of it.<br>
The UTs communicate only with their corresponding AP, who in turn routes the packets toward their destination.<br>
[0012]	It is an object of the present invention to provide a system using<br>
a Power Line Carrier for network communication by installing an AP at one or more electrical panels and connecting these APs together using standard Ethernet links over twisted-pair cabling. For network management purposes, it is desirable to designate one of the APs as a primary and the others secondaries. Therefore, this network contains three types of device: Primary AP, Secondary AP, and UT.<br>
[0013]	It is clear that by inserting an Access Point (AP) at the Main<br>
panel, and routing all packets through that AP, the worst-case scenario for a channel between any two users is significantly improved. Instead of a single hop with 9 impairments (6 outlets and 3 panels), a user on outlet A can reach a user on outlet B via 2 hops with 5 impairments each (3 outlets and 2 panels). In a building of sufficient size, the insertion of one ore more APs will enable communication between users who previously could not communicate with each other.<br>
[0014]	In a multi-AP installation, a given UT may be able to<br>
communicate to some degree with more than one AP. In this case, the UT selects the most appropriate AP to use by estimating the speed with which it can communicate with each AP and selecting the AP with which it can communicate with at the highest rate.<br>
[0015]	Nodes which make use of the invention are referred to as<br>
endpoints. Endpoints can be connected to the Ethernet interface of either an<br>
AP or a UT, possibly through one or more standard Ethernet hubs or<br>
switches. The present invention provides transport of Ethernet frames from a<br>
source endpoint to one or more destination endpoints.<br>
[0016]	Other objects, advantages and novel features of the present<br>
invention will become apparent from the following detailed description of the invention when considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0034]	Figure 2a details the positioning of access points 11 and 17<br>
within sub-panels 10 and 16. User terminals 20 and 20' are connected to the<br>
respective access point 11 and 17 by the power line carrier communication in<br>
between access points 11 and 17 is accomplished through an Ethernet<br>
connection directed by hub 15. All signals to be later discussed received by<br>
hub 15 are directed to all access points with the receipt of these signals based<br>
on the address so that access points for which signals are not destined will<br>
not be accepted. Although structure 15 is shown as a hub, in other<br>
embodiments device 15 can be an Ethernet switching device used whereby<br>
signals are not sent to all Access Points (AP) but only to the intended Access<br>
Points (AP).<br>
[0035]	The Primary* AP (PAP), Secondary AP (SAP), and UT hardware<br>
all share the common architecture depicted in Figure 3.<br>
[0036]	The platform 20 can be viewed as a microprocessor with two<br>
interfaces: one Ethernet and one PLC. The Ethernet interface works as follows. The Ethernet MAC (Medium Access Protocol) sends and receives IEEE 802.3 Ethernet frames using the Ethernet Physical Layer (PHY) transceiver, which in turn connects to a twisted-pair medium. Frames received on the twisted-pair are demodulated by the PHY, forwarded on to the MAC for frame synchronization and error-checking, and then placed in the shared RAM to be read by the microprocessor. Frames to be transmitted on the twisted-pair are written to the shared RAM, read by the MAC, and then transmitted on the medium via the PHY.<br>
[0037]	The PLC interface is similar to the Ethernet interface in that it<br>
sends and receives similarly formatted frames and the data path is the same. The main differences are in the nature of the MAC and PHY. The modulation method used by the PHY is one appropriate for use over a power wiring network. Similarly, the medium access protocol used by the MAC is one optimized to perform well under the channel conditions found in a power wiring network.<br>
[0038]	The user terminal UT constructed in accordance with Figure 3 is<br>
part of an end point structure of the type illustrated in Figure 4 wherein User Terminal 20 is shown as receiving an output from Ethernet card 35 of the PC 30 with its associated input keyboard 37. The output of User Terminal 20 is fed to the ordinary power line connection point 40 having 2 terminals. One of the terminals is connected as a source of power for the PC while the other carries the output signal from the user terminalto be provided for transmission over the PLC (power line carrier). Although the user terminal Is shown as<br>
outside of the PC, in.another embodiment it could be positioned inside the PC in addition to or as part of the Ethernet card.<br>
[0039]	When a frame is received on either the PLC or the Ethernet<br>
interface, the frame is written to RAM and the microprocessor is notified of the frame's arrival. The microprocessor examines the frame header and, based on this header and the contents of bridging tables stored in RAM, retransmits the frame on one or both interfaces, possibly modifying the header first. Frames transferred over twisted-pair Ethernet can be either External frames or AP-to-AP frames. External frames are standard Ethernet frames which are received from or transmitted to an endpoint, and have the standard IEEE 802.3 format (410) illustrated in Figure 5a.<br>
[0040]	The Destination Address (DA) (411) is a 48-bit Ethernet address<br>
representing the ID of the station that is the intended recipient of the frame. The Source Address (SA) (412) is a 48-bit Ethernet address representing the ID of the station that is the originator of the frame. These fields are preserved as the frame passes through an Ethernet-to-Ethernet MAC layer bridge. The TYPE (413) field is a 16-bit identifier that is also referred to as the protocol ID. This field indicates which higher-layer protocol the frame belongs to, and defines the format of the variable-length DATA section (414). The CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) (415) is a 16-bit field used to verify the integrity of the frame.<br>
[0041]	Frames transferred over power wiring have the format of (420)<br>
as shown in Figure 5b. The Receiver Address (RA) (421) is an address representing the ID of the PLC interface that the frame is immediately directed<br>
toward. The Transmitter Address (TA) (422) represents the ID of the PLC<br>
interface transmitting the frame. The remaining fields have the same meaning as in (410).<br>
[0042]	AP-to-AP frames are transferred between the PAP and a SAP<br>
and have the format of (430) shown in Figure 5c. The RA (431) represents<br>
the frame's immediate receiver, and will either be the address of the PAP or la<br>
SAP, depending on the frame's direction. AP-to-AP frames can be either<br>
downstream or upstream. Downstream frames originate from a non-AP node<br>
connected off the PAP's Ethernet interface and terminate at a node connected<br>
to a UT. Upstream frames originate from a node connected to a UT and<br>
terminate at a non-AP node connected off the PAP's Ethernet interface. The<br>
Proxy Address (PA) (433) field represents the address of the UT which is<br>
"proxy" for the DA node. For downstream frames, the SAP forwards the frame<br>
to,the UT whose address is PA (433), and this UT in turn forwards the frame<br>
to its Ethernet interface, where the frame reaches the endpoint with address<br>
DA (434). For upstream frames, the PA (433) is used by the PAP to allow it to<br>
maintain its table of UTs, and endpoints reachable via each.<br>
[0043]	The differences between the PAP, SAP, and UT device types is<br>
in the way frames are routed between the two interfaces. The majority of the routing decision making is done at the PAP, which uses tables stored in its RAM in the decision process. One of these tables is the SAP table (510) of Figure 6a, which is an indexed table of SAPs the PAP is aware of. The SAP IDX (512) of zero is reserved to represent the PAP. [0044]         Also in the PAP is the Proxy Table (520) of Figure 6b&gt; which is an indexed table of UTs the PAP is aware of. The Proxy IDX (522) of zero is reserved to represent the PAP Ethernet interface. The SAP IDX (526)<br>
represents the index of the SAP (512) in which the UT is reachable through. A SAP IDX (526) of zero means the UT is reachable directly via the PAP's PLC interface.<br>
[0045]  t       A third PAP table is the Endpoint Table (530) of Figure 0c, which is a table of all endpoints the PAP is aware of.<br>
[0046]	The PAP packet processing flow is illustrated in (600) of Figure<br>
7. A frame received on the PLC interface is could have only come from a UT (proxy) and is in the format of (420). The TA (422) is the proxy address and is added to the proxy table if a corresponding entry does not already exist (624). The SAP IDX field (526) corresponding to this entry is set to zero to indicate the proxy is reachable directly from the PAP, The SA (424) is the source address of the endpoint that sent the frame and this endpoint is .added (62J3) to the endpoint table (530) if it does not already exist. The Proxy IDX (534) corresponding to the endpoint is set to the index of the proxy in the proxy . table (522) corresponding to the TA (422). The DA field (423) is then examined (628) to determine if the frame is a broadcast type. If it is, the RA (421) and TA (422) fields are* removed from the frame the remaining frame is transmitted on the Ethernet interface (636). Aiso, the frame is broadcast to all powerline nodes by means of the PL Broadcast method (720) shown in Figure 8b. If the frame is not a broadcast, the DA (423) is compared against a!!... nodes (630) in the endpoint table (530) to determine if the location of the destination node is known. If the DA (423) does not match any node in the endpoint table (530), control transfers to block (536) and the frame is sent out to the Ethernet interface and all proxies. If the DA (423) does match an<br>
endpoint table (530) entry, the proxy index field for that entry (5,34) is.<br>
examined (632) to determine the location of the destination endpoint. If the<br>
Proxy IDX (534) equals zero, the endpoint is located on the Ethernet interface<br>
and the frame is transmitted there (640). If the Proxy IDX (534) is nonzero,<br>
the endpoint is located off a proxy and control transfers to the Proxy Xmit<br>
method (700) shown in Figure 8a.	,<br>
[0047]	A frame received on a PAP's Ethernet interface is examined to<br>
determine if it came from a SAP or an endpoint (604). If it is from a SAP, it is in the format of (430) and the RA (431) is compared against the ADDR fields (514) of the SAP table (510), and the SAP is added to the table if it does not already exist (616). Then the PA field (433) is compared against the ADDR fields (524) of the proxy table (520), and a new proxy is added with ADDR=PA if one does not already exist (618). Control is then transferred to point (627). If the frame came from an endpoint, it is in the format of (410) and the SA (412) is compared against the ADDR fields (532) of all entries in the endpoint table (530) and a new entry is created if no match is found (606). Then the DA (411) is examined to determine if the frame is a broadcast type (608). If it is a broadcast, control transfers to the PL Broadcast method (720) shown in Figure 8b. Otherwise, the DA (411) is searched in the ADDR fields (532) of the endpoint table (610). If the DA (411) is not found, control transfers to the PL Broadcast method (720). If there is a match, the Proxy IDX field (534) is examined (612) to determine the location of the destination endpoint If the Proxy IDX (534) equals zero, the endpoint is located on the Ethernet interface and the frame is dropped because it has already reached its destination. If the Proxy IDX (534) is nonzero, the endpoint is located off a proxy and control transfers to the Proxy Xmit method (700).<br>
[0048]	The Proxy Xmit method (700) transmits a frame to a UT, either<br>
directly over the PLC interface or indirectly through a SAP. The SAP IDX field<br>
(526) in the proxy table is examined (702) to determine the route to reach the<br>
proxy. If SAP IDX (526) equals zero, the frame is sent on the PLC interface in<br>
the format of (420). The TA (422) field is set to the PAP address (712), the<br>
RA field (421) is set to the proxy address (714), and the frame is transmitted<br>
on the PLC interface (716). If SAP IDX (526) is nonzero, the frame is sent on<br>
the Ethernet interface in the format of (430). The PA field (433) is set to the<br>
proxy address (704), the TA field (432) is set to the PAP address (706), the<br>
RA field (431) is set to the address of the SAP corresponding to the SAP IDX<br>
(526) (708), and the frame is sent on the Ethernet interface (710).<br>
[0049]	The PL Broadcast method (720) sends a frame such that it:<br>
reaches all endpoints reachable via a UT. To do this, the frame is broadcast on the PLC interface in the format of (420) and also broadcast on the Ethernet interface to all SAPs in the format of (430). For the PLC trajrjsmiss)or|j^hjiJA (422) is sot to the PAP address and the RA (421) is set to the broadcast address (722), and the frame is sent on the PLC interface (724). For the Ethernettraiismission, the PA field (433) is set to the broadcast ad&amp;e|s. the (726), the TA (432) is set to the PAP address, and the RA (431) is set to the broadcast address (728), and the frame is transmitted on the Ethernet interface (730).  ..<br>
[0050]	The SAP processing flow (800) is illustrated in Figure 9. Frames<br>
received on the Ethernet interface are in the format of (430), and retransmitted on the PLC interface in the format of (420). The RA field (421) is<br>
field (433) of the incoming frame and the TA field (422) is set to the SAP<br>
address (804). Frames received on the PLC interface are in the format of (420), and retransmitted on the Ethernet interface in the format of (430). The PA field (433) is set to the TA field (422) of the incoming frame, the TA field (432) is set to the SAP address, and the RA field (431) is set to the PAP address (806). Each SAP knows the address of the PAP because the PAP periodically broadcasts a frame in the format of (410), which announces itself as the PAP.<br>
[0051]	The UT processing flow (900) is illustrated in Figure 10. When a<br>
frame is received on the Ethernet interface, its SA (412) is compared (904) against all entries in the UT Ethernet endpoint table, which has the format of (540) of Figure 6d, and a new entry (542) is added if no match exists. Then, the DA (411) is compared (906) against entries in the same table (540). If the DA (411) exists, the frame is discarded (908). If the DA (411) does not exist, the frame is sent out on the PLC interface in the format of (420). The TA field (422) is set to the UT address (910) and the RA field (421) is set to the AP address (912). This AP address can be the address of the PAP or the address of a SAP, depending on which AP the UT selected as its AP. When a frame is received on the PLC interface, the RA (421) and TA (422) fields are stripped off (916) and the frame is sent (918) on the Ethernet interface in the format of (410). The following procedure is used by each UT to select Its AP. The PAP and all SAPs periodically broadcast a frame in the format of (410) on their PLC interface, announcing themselves as an AP. Any UT capable of joining the network will be able to receive these frames from one or more APs. If a UT can receive these frames from only one AP, it selects that AP. If the<br>
UT can receive these frames from two or more APs, it estimates its<br>
connection speed with each AP, and selects the one with the highest speed.<br>
This connection speed may be obtained via several methods. This metric<br>
may be generated by the PLC MAC function and passed up to the packet<br>
routing function. Otherwise, the packet routing function may send a special<br>
frame type to each AP, which the AP immediately sends back to the UT. The<br>
UT measures the time elapsed between sending and receiving the packet,<br>
and selects the AP which it received the frame back from in the shortest time.<br>
