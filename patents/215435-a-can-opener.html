				<td>The present invention relates to a can opener.<br>
For years the applicant has been very successfully producing and marketing can openers for opening conventional cans. With older systems the can lid is cut through along its inner edge and separated from the lateral wall of the can. Since the separated part of the lid is sharp-edged and may lead to injury  in the last years so-called safety can openers have been introduced which cut through the can lid along its outer edge. The connection between the can wall and the lid is released without sharp edges remaining on the lid to be removed or on the can edge. Since the cutting wheel does not come into contact with the can contents on the one hand it is ensured that the cutting mechanics of the opener are not dirtied and on the other hand the can contents are protected from contamination from the cutting mechanics.<br>
Such safety can openers are for example known from US-A-4,782,594 and DE-U-298,02,030. For both cutting principles pincer models as well as one-armed models are known.<br>
In order to permit the opening of cans also without a can opener the packaging industry offers cans with which the lid by way of a pull or tear-open ring may be released from the can along a peripheral break-off line. Such tear-open cans are more complicated in manufacture and by way of this more expensive than conventional cans. The break-off lines create tight manufacturing tolerances and are therefore more succeptible to erroneous functions.<br><br>
If for example the material thickness along the break-off line is too great then the opening is only possible with the application of a considerable pulling force. It is particularly the case with older or weaker persons that the opening of such a can causes particular problems.<br>
From US-A-5"018"409 there is known an opener for tear-open cans. On the front end of this opener on the upper side there is mounted a recess which defines a lug for suspending the tear-open ring. The rear part of the flat opener is formed parabolically and blends into a narrower grip part. For opening a tear-open can, the ring attached on the lid at the edge is lifted up and at the same time the break-off line directly in front of the ring in the known manner is broken through. Now the ring is suspended into the recess on the front end of the opener and by way of pressure on the grip part whilst exploiting the lever arm the can lid is released from the can. The opener at the same time with its parabolic back rolled over the can lid and simultaneously the lid region which carriers the tear-open ring is lifted and pulled upwards and to the rear. The opener which for example may be punched from one piece of sheet metal is relatively narrow. The contact surface of the opener back on the can lid is therefore small and on account of this on opening a can a slipping of the opener may easily occur.<br>
A further opener for tear-open cans is disclosed in the US design 2 67"925. Also this opener is manufactured from a flat piece of sheet metal. It comprises a hook-like end for opening the tear-open can as well as an opposite end for opening bottles with crown tops. The again very narrow opener may likewise easily slip when being used.<br>
If the two above	mentioned openers are also to be applied<br>
for  opening  larger	cans  then  they  must  be  designed<br>
correspondingly large	which in turn makes them unwieldy and<br>
bulky.<br><br>
With both openers no conventional cans may be opened.<br>
The object of the present invention is to make available a space-saving can opener which permits all commercially available cans to be opened securely and comfortably and which does not have the above mentioned disadvantages.<br>
These objects are achieved by a device as described herein.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a can opener of a grip-like body with a head in which there is accommodated a cutting mechanism for separating a can lid from a can, characterised in that the grip-like body is connected in a pivotingly movable manner to a pull hook for opening tear-open cans, said pull hook at its end region distant to the pivot pin being provided with an attachment recess, wherein the pivoting movement of the pull hook is limited by abutment means on the body.<br>
Further preferred embodiment variants are described herein.<br>
The can opener according to the invention not only permits the common types of can packagings to be opened with only a single apparatus but its ergonomic and functionally advantageous shaping on use offers the highest degree of comfort and safety. Furthermore the opener according to the invention may be put away in a very space-saving manner.<br>
In the drawing there is represented an embodiment example of the subject matter of the invention and this is explained in the subsequent description. There are shown:<br>
Figure 1 a lateral view of an embodiment form of the opener according to the invention with a folded out pull hook, wherein the body of the opener in the region of the attachment of the pull hook is shown partly sectioned;<br>
Figure 2 a view from above on the can opener according to the invention, according to Figure 1;<br><br>
Figure 3 a lateral view of a further embodiment form of the opener according to the invention, partly in section with a folded-in pull hook, wherein the pull hook in the folded-out position is shown dot-dashed and the cutting mechanics have been left out;<br>
Figure 4 a view from above on the can opener according to the invention according to Figure 3, wherein likewise the cutting mechanics have been left out;<br>
Figure 5 a lateral view of a pull hook according to the invention.<br>
In the drawing there are shown two embodiment examples of the subject-matter of the invention, which essentially differ by the design form of the pull hook and the adaptations connected to this. For functionally equal elements in the following the same reference numerals have been applied. A first embodiment form is represented in the Figures 1 and 2, wherein here also the cutting mechanism 20 is shown, whilst in the Figures 3 to 5 there is shown a second embodiment form, wherein here the cutting mechanism has been omitted.<br>
The opener as a whole is indicated with the reference numeral 1. This has, as an essential element, a grip-like body 10. The grip-like body 10 has two parallel, planar side surfaces 11 as this is evident in the view from above in Figure 2. The grip-like body 10 has an upper arcuate back surface 12 and a lower curved surface 13 lying opposite this. By way of the curved lower surface 13 at one end there is formed a head 13 in which the cutting mechanism 20 is accommodated and at the other end a thickened grip end 16 in which the pull hook 30 at least partly is accommodated. Between the head 15 and the thickened grip piece 16 there is thus formed a grip trough 14 in the curved lower surface 13. In the thickened grip end 16 centrally and parallel to the two side surfaces 11 there is admitted a receiving groove<br><br>
17. This receiving groove begins at the thickened grip end 16 and directed inclined towards the grip trough 14 runs out into the curved lower surface 13. By way of the receiving groove 17 in the thickened grip end 16 there are formed two side cheeks which are transversely passed through by a pivoting axis bearing 18.<br>
As already mentioned in the thickened head 15 there is located the cutting mechanism indicated as a whole at 20. This consists of a traction wheel 21 which is seated on a traction pin 26 in a rotationally secure manner. The traction pin runs perpendicular to the planar side surfaces 11 and completely passes through the grip-like body 10. On that end of the traction pin 2 6 lying opposite the traction wheel 21 there is formed a rotary grip 22 by way of which the traction wheel 21 may be actuated. Perpendicular to the traction pin 26 there runs the pin, not shown here, of the cutting wheel 23. The cutting wheel 23 during the actuation of the cutting mechanism lies on the outside on the weld bulge of the tin or can to be opened and cuts through this. A two-point contact bow 24 with this lies on the upper edge of the can bulge. The cutting wheel 23 with the two-point contact bow 24 encloses an acute angle in order to produce a separating force directed upwards. Such cutting mechanisms are known in detail from the initially mentioned documents.<br>
In the mentioned receiving groove 17 of the grip-like body 10 as already mentioned there is partly accommodated a pivotable pull hook 39. The pull hook 30 is pivotable by a certain angle about a pivot pin 31 which passes through the already mentioned pivot pin bearing 18. In the pivoted-in position the pull hook 30 with its pull hook inner edge 35 bears on the groove base 17". In the pivoted-out condition the rear-side end near to the pivot pin comes to bear on the groove base 17" by which means the pivoting movement of the pull hook 30 is limited.<br>
The pull hook 30 is a planar, relatively thick element. It may for example be formed of a steel plate or also of a high-strength, for example glass-fibre reinforced plastic. The pull<br><br>
hook 30 is passed through by a pivot pin 31 which as already mentioned lies in a pivot pin bearing 18. The pull hook 30 in the embodiment example according to Figure 1 has a straight-running pull hook inner edge 35 and a convex rolling back 33. At the end distant to the pivot pin the pull hook 30 on the pull hook inner edge 35 comprises an attachment recess 31. Into this attachment recess 32 comes to lie the pull ring R on actuation. The shape of the attachment recess 32 may be configured in any way but it must be formed such that the pull ring R during the actuation does not slip out of the attachment recess 32. This for example is achieved by an approximately rectangular or trapezoidal recess.<br>
The course of the pull hook inner edge 35 per se is not of a direct importance. Instead of the straight course shown here the inner edge 35 may be shaped curving inwards or outwards, wherein this however is not so favourable. If the inner edge 35 is curved inwards then the pull hook 30 has more a crescent-shape configuration, by which means however the strength of the pull hook itself is reduced. If however the inner edge 35 of the pull hook 30 is curved outwards then correspondingly the receiving groove must be deepened, respectively the groove base 17" be directed concavely inwards. This then accordingly leads to a reduction of the cross section of the grip-like body 10 in this region and accordingly to a certain weakening.<br>
In Figure 5 there is shown an optimised form of the pull hook 30 alone. The attachment recess 32 is located roughly at the opposite end to the pivot pin 34. In contrast to the embodiment form according to the Figures 1 and 2 here the pull hook inner edge 35 is shown running slightly angled. The rolling back 33 is shaped roughly equal to that of the previously described solution. In the vicinity of the attachment recess the rolling back 33 has a radius ri whilst in the region near the pivot pin bearing 34 the rolling back 33 has a radius r2. The radius ri is with this smaller than the radius Zz. By way of this it is achieved that the pull ring R initially exerts a more upwardly directed pulling component.  Schematically indicated there is<br><br>
shown the opening operation in Figure 1 in a dot-dashed manner. The pull ring R lies in the attachment recess 32 and the tear-open lid D is pulled upwards, whilst the pull hook 30 rolls on the not yet opened region of the lid of the tin B or can.<br>
As already mentioned the pull hook in the embodiment form according to Figure 5 comprises a pull hook inner edge 35 running angled. Thanks to the angled location 36 the pivot pin bearing 34 comes to lie practically above the extended pull hook inner edge 35. This permits the formation of a contact edge 38 which comes to bear on the base of an abutment recess 19 in the grip-like body. Thanks to this configuration an improved force transfer from the pull hook 30 into the grip-like body 10 takes place. Simultaneously however the pull hook 30 is rather reinforced whilst the cross section of the grip-like body here by way of the angled course of the groove base 10" is hardly reduced and because at the same time the pivot axis 31 is practically arranged in the extension of the groove base 17", the force via the abutment surface is directly introduced into the stiffened region, whilst with the previously described solution practically the whole force was introduced via the bearing into the mentioned side cheeks laterally of the receiving groove.<br>
In the Figures 3 and 4 the previous already described cutting mechanism was not shown. In the grip-like body 10 preferably manufactured of plastic only the driving pin bearing 25 and the receiving bores 27 for the contact bow 24 are evident.<br><br>
