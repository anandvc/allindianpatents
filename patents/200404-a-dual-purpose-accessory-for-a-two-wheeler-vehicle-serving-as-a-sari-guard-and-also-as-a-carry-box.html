				<td>This invention relates to a dual purpose accessory for a two wheeler vehicle serving as a sari guard and also as a carry-box.<br>
The sari guard for two wheeler vehicles is known to the art. This device is used to prevent the sari of a woman pillion rider from getting entangled in the rear wheel of the vehicle when in motion.<br>
An object of this invention is to utilise the space available adjacent the sari guard to provide a carry-box for carrying various articles, such as, a briefcase, a market-bag and so on, whenever there is n<f pillion rider on the vehicle. however whenever a person desires to ride carry-box can be rendered collaosible and put away by side of sari guard flush with it so that there is no inconvenience caused rider.></f>
Â»<br>
As a corollary of the foregoing object of this invention, another object is to make the best use of an existing accessory to furnish another accessory with minor additions to the former accessory.<br><br>
According to this invention, the dual purpose accessory for a two wheeler vehicle serving as a sari guard and also as a carry-box, comprises a first frame attachable to the side of the vehicle, at its rear, said first frame being provided with a footrest and a screen serving as a sari guard; a second frame hingeabiy attached, at its sides, to the first frame by at least two arms, to enable the second frame to be folded along with the arms, to lie flush against the first frame, and to be unfolded along with the arms, to rest on the footrest, substantially parallel to the first frame, thus creating a carry-box structure defined by the first and second frames and also by the said arms, for receiving within said structure, articles to be transported along with the vehicle.<br>
This invention will now be described in further detail with reference to the accompanying drawings which illustrate, by way of example, and not by way of limitation, one of possible embodiments of the dual purpose accessory proposed herein, wherein Figs.l and 2 illustrate side and front views of the embodiment with the second frame in its folded condition<br><br>
Figs. 3 and 4 illustrate side and front views of the embodiment with the second frame in its unfolded condition creating a carry-box structure<br>
Figs. 5 and 6 illustrate side and front views of the embodiment with the carry-box structure containing a brief case T, exemplifying an article to be carried with the vehicle.<br>
A first frame Fl is attachable to the side of the vehicle, at its rear, the fram e Fl being provided with afootrest A and a screen S1 serving as a sari guard.<br>
A second frame F2 is hingeably attached at its sides to the first frame Fl by at least two arms C to enable the second frame to be folded along with the arras C, to lie flush against the first frame Fl and to be unfolded along with the arms C, to rest on the footrest A, substantially parallel to the first frame, thus creating a carry-box structure D defmed by the first and second frames and also by the arms C, for receiving within said structure, articles to be tansported along with the vehicle. This structure is suitable for receiving therem articles, such as, briefcases, bags and so on. The footrest A of the sari<br><br>
guard S serves as the base support for the articles in the carry-box structure D.<br>
The arms C have studs P at their ends for hingeably attaching the first frame Fl to the second frame F2, while, at the same time, preventing the arms C from coming off the frames Fl, F2. Frame F2 is also provided with a screen S2 which remains parallel to screen SI in the folded position of the frame F2 and which prevents any article placed in the carry-box structure D from<br>
failing off through the frame F2 in its unfolded position.<br>
f<br>
The arms C and the frames Fl F2 are respectively spfing loaded e.g. by the torsion spring R consequent to which frame F2 is always drawn towards frame Fl under spring force. This force also causes frame F2 to clasp an article placed within the carry-box structure D frimly in place.<br>
*<br>
The frame F2 is peripherally located within the frame Fl.<br>
&gt;<br>
In its folded condition, the top of the frame F2 is seated in an E-clamp K1 provided for the top of the frame Fl. In its unfolded condition, the bottom of the frame F2, is seated in E-clamps K2 and K3 fixed to the footrest A, to firmly position the frame F2 in place.<br><br>
It will be appreciated from the foregoing description that various other embodiments of the accessory proposed herein are possible without departing from the scope and ambit of this invention.<br><br><br><br>
We Claim:<br>
1.	A dual purpose accessory for a two wheeler vehicle serving as a sari guard and also as a carry-box, comprising a first frame attachable to the side of the vehicle, at its rear, said first frame being provided with a footrest and a screen serving as a sari guard; a second frame hingeably attached, at its sides, to the first frame by at least two arms, to enable the second frame to be folded along with the arms, to lie flush against the first frame, and to be unfolded along with the arms, to rest on the footrest, substantially parallel to the first frame, thus creating a carry-box structure defined by the first and second frames and also by the said arms, for receiving within said structure, articles to be transported along with the vehicle.<br>
2.	A dual purpose accessory as claimed in Claim 1 wherein the second frame and the first frame are peripherally located one within the other and spaced from each other.<br>
3. A dual purpose accessory as claimed in any one of the preceding Claims wherein the top of the first frame is provided with an E-clamp for seating the top of the second frame in its folded condition.<br><br>
4.	A dual purpose accessory as claimed in any one of the preceding Claims wherein the footrest is provided with two other E-ciamps for seating the bottom of the second frame in its unfolded condition.<br>
5.	A dual purpose accessory as claimed in any one of the proceeding Claims wherein the arms comprise studs at their ends for hingeably attaching the first frame to the second frame, while preventing the arms from coming off the said frames.<br>
6.	A dual purpose accessory as claimed in any one of the proceeding claims wherein the second frame comprises a second screen which remains parallel to the first screen in the folded position of the secpnd frame and prevents an article placed in the carry-box structure from falling off through the second frame in its unfolded position.<br>
7.	A duid purpose accessory as claimed in any one of the proceeding claims wherein the arms of the first and second frames are respectively spring-loaded for drawing the second frame towards the first frame and also for gasping an article placed within the carry-box firmly in place.<br><br>
8- A dual purpose accessory for a two wheeler vehicle serving as a sari guard and also as a carry- box, substantially as herein described with reference to, and as illustrated in, the accompanying   drawings.<br>
