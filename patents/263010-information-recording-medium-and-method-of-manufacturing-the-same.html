SPECIFICATION<br>
INFORMATION RECORDING MEDIUM AND<br>
METHOD OF MANUFACTURING THE SAME<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to an information recording medium wherein information is<br>
recorded, erased, overwritten and/or reproduced optically or electronically, and a method of<br>
manufacturing the same.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002] In conventional information recording media, a phase-change information recording<br>
medium that utilizes a phase-change phenomenon in a recording layer (phase-change<br>
material layer) is produced. Among these phase-change information recording media, one<br>
in which information is recorded, erased, overwritten and/or reproduced optically by using<br>
a laser beam is an optical phase-change information recording medium. In an optical phase-<br>
change information recording medium, a change of state of the recording layer is produced<br>
as a result of heat generated by irradiation with a laser beam, and the difference in<br>
reflectance is detected and is read out as information. Among optical phase-change<br>
information recording media, in a overwritable optical phase-change information recording<br>
medium in which information can be erased and overwritten, the initial state of the<br>
recording layer is generally a crystalline phase, and when information is recorded, the<br>
recording layer is melted by irradiating with a high power (recording power) laser beam<br>
and then is rapidly cooled, and thus the laser-irradiated portion becomes amorphous. On the<br>
contrary, when information is erased, the recording layer is warmed by irradiating with a<br>
laser beam which has a lower power than the power used for the recording and then is<br>
cooled, and thus the laser-irradiated portion becomes crystalline. Consequently, in a<br>
rewritable optical phase-change information recording medium, by irradiating the recording<br>
layer with a laser beam for which the power is modulated between a high power level and a<br>
low power level, it is possible for new information to be recorded or overwritten while<br>
recorded information is being erased. Moreover, among optical phase-change information<br>
recording media, for write-once optical phase-change information recording media in<br>
which it is possible for information to be recorded one time but not possible for<br>
information to be erased or overwritten, the initial state of the recording layer is generally<br>
an amorphous phase, and the laser-irradiated portion becomes crystalline as the recording<br>
layer warms up and cools while being irradiated with a high power (recording power) laser<br>
beam when information is recorded.<br>
[0003] Instead of the abovementioned irradiation with a laser beam, there are also electrical<br><br>
phase-change information recording media that record information by causing a state<br>
change in the phase-change material of the recording layer by means of Joule heating<br>
generated by the application of electrical energy (for example electrical current). In these<br>
electrical phase-change information recording media, the phase-change material of the<br>
recording layer undergoes a state change between a crystalline phase (low resistance) and<br>
an amorphous phase (high resistance) by means of Joule heating generated by the<br>
application of electrical current, and the difference in electrical resistance between the<br>
crystalline phase and amorphous phase is detected and is reproduced as information.<br>
[0004] The commercial 4.7GB/DVD-RAM is given as an example of an optical phase-change<br>
information recording medium. As shown in Fig. 12 for information recording medium 12,<br>
the 4.7 GB/DVD-RAM has a 7-layer configuration, where first dielectric layer 2, first<br>
interface layer 3, recording layer 4, second interface layer 5, second dielectric layer 6, light<br>
absorption correction layer 7, and reflection layer 8 are provided over substrate 1 in this<br>
order from the laser incident side.<br>
[0005] First dielectric layer 2 and second dielectric layer 6 adjust the optical path and enhance<br>
the light absorption efficiency of recording layer 4, so that optical action increases the<br>
signal intensity as the change in reflectance between the crystalline phase and the<br>
amorphous phase grows larger, and serve a thermal function to insulate the heat-sensitive<br>
substrate 1 and dummy substrate 10 and so forth from the heat due to the higher<br>
temperature of recording layer 4 during recording. As a dielectric material, for example,<br>
conventionally used (ZnS)80(SiO2)20 (mol%) is a superior dielectric material that has<br>
transparency and a high refractive index, and is also a good insulator with low thermal<br>
conductivity, favorable mechanical characteristics and resistance to humidity. Furthermore,<br>
the thicknesses of first dielectric layer 2 and second dielectric layer 6 is determined exactly<br>
according to a calculation based on the matrix method, so as to satisfy conditions that<br>
increase the change in the amount of reflected light between the crystalline phase and<br>
amorphous phase of recording layer 4, and increase the light absorption in recording layer<br>
4.<br>
[0006] By using a high crystallization speed material in recording layer 4 that includes Ge-Sn-<br>
Sb-Te wherein Sn substitutes for a portion of the Ge in the pseudo-binary phase-change<br>
material GeTe-Sb2Te3 that combines the compounds GeTe and Sb2Te3, not only is there<br>
efficient overwriting of the initial recording, but superior recording storage stability (the<br>
indicator of whether the recorded signal can be recovered after long-term storage) and<br>
overwriting storage stability (the indicator of whether the recorded signal can be erased or<br>
overwritten after long-term storage) are also realized.<br>
[0007] First interface layer 3 and second interface layer 5 function to prevent mass transfer from<br>
taking place between first dielectric layer 2 and recording layer 4, and between second<br>
dielectric layer 6 and recording layer 4. In this mass transfer phenomenon, when<br><br>
r<br>
(ZnS)80(SiO2)20 (mol%) is used in first dielectric layer 2 and second dielectric layer 6, S<br>
(sulfur) diffuses into the recording layer during the time when recording layer 4 is<br>
irradiated with a laser beam for repeated recording and overwriting. When S diffuses into<br>
the recording layer, the repeat overwriting capability deteriorates. The use of Ge-containing<br>
nitrides in first interface layer 3 and second interface layer 5 favors the avoidance of this<br>
deterioration of the repeat overwriting capability (for example, see Patent Document 1).<br>
[0008] Through the use of technology such as that described above, superior overwriting<br>
performance and high reliability were achieved and the 4.7GB/D VD-RAM was brought to<br>
commercialization.<br>
Moreover, various kinds of technology have been studied in order to obtain information<br>
recording media with higher capacity. In the example of optical phase-change information<br>
recording media, a high density recording technique with a smaller laser beam spot<br>
diameter was investigated by using a violet-blue laser with a shorter wavelength than that<br>
of the conventional red laser, and by using a thinner substrate on the laser beam-incident<br>
side and an objective lens with a larger numerical aperture (NA). When recording is carried<br>
out with a smaller spot diameter, since the time irradiating laser beam with the recording<br>
layer become relatively short, the recording layer needs to be made up of materials which<br>
has high crystallization ability or to be contact with an interface layer which has -high<br>
crystallization promoting effect so that short time crystallization is available.<br>
[0009] In addition, the information capacity increases two-fold by using an optical phase-change<br>
information recording medium that is provided with two information layers (referred to<br>
below as a bilayer optical phase-change information recording medium), and the technique<br>
of carrying out recording and reproducing operations on the two information layers by<br>
using an incident laser beam from one side has also been investigated (for example see<br>
Patent Documents 2 and 3). In these bilayer optical phase-change information recording<br>
media, laser beam that is used will pass through the information layer proximal to the laser<br>
beam incident side (referred to as the first information layer) in order to perform recording<br>
and reproducing operations on the information layer distal to the laser beam incident side<br>
(referred to below as the second information layer), so the first information layer should<br>
have an extremely thin film thickness and high transparency. However, as the recording<br>
layer becomes thinner, crystal nuclei formed during the crystallization of the recording<br>
layer decrease and a distance of atom transfer becomes shorter. Thus, as the recording layer<br>
becomes thinner, the harder will be forming the crystal phase (i.e. the crystallization speed<br>
becomes low). For the above reasons, in the first information layer where the recording<br>
layer is thin, the recording layer needs to be made up of materials which has high<br>
crystallization ability or to be contact with an interface layer which has high crystallization<br>
promoting effect.<br>
[0010] In addition, when the transfer rate of information becomes high by shortening the<br><br>
recording time of the information of the information recording medium, the crystallization<br>
time becomes short. Thus, to realize phase-change information recording media which<br>
support high transfer rates, the recording layer here also needs to be made up of materials<br>
which has high crystallization ability or to be contact with an interface layer which has<br>
high crystallization promoting effect.<br>
[0011] Heretofore, inventors have introduced materials which have high crystallization ability<br>
for the recording layer, and have introduced Ge-containing nitrides in interface layers<br>
arranged on both sides of the information layer in substantially the same manner as with<br>
the 4.7GB/DVD-RAM.<br>
[0012] However, in a case that the materials which have high crystallization ability for the<br>
recording layer is used to improve the crystallization speed of an optical phase-change<br>
information recording medium, forming the amorphous state will be hard particularly for a<br>
overwritable optical phase-change information recording medium. Thus, the recording<br>
layer must be heated to a high temperature to broaden a melting area and then must be<br>
rapidly cooled. This requires higher energy (laser power) for the information recording.<br>
Then, when the conventional Ge-containing nitrides are used for the interface layers, heat<br>
generated in the recording layer destroys the interface layer and the repeat overwriting<br>
capability rapidly deteriorates.<br>
[0013] Moreover, since Ge-containing nitrides have high thermal conductivity, if a thicker<br>
interface layer is constructed, the heat will facilitate the diffusion. As a result, there is a<br>
problem with reduced recording sensitivity.<br>
In addition, to improve the repeat overwriting capability, when an interface layer<br>
containing Cr and O, not the abovementioned Ge-containing nitrides, is introduced, the<br>
repeat overwriting capability improves but the signal storage stability of recording marks<br>
deteriorates. Even this interface layer containing Cr and O is used, there is a problem with<br>
reduced recording sensitivity.<br>

PREFFERED EMBODIMENTS OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
[0020] Hereinafter, embodiments of the invention are explained with reference to the diagrams.<br>
Furthermore, while examples of embodiments are given below, the present invention is not<br>
limited to these embodiments. Moreover, in the embodiments given below, where there are<br>
multiple occurrences of same component identified by the same symbol, that component<br>
will be omitted from the explanation.<br>
(Embodiment 1)<br>
[0021] An example of an information recording medium of the present invention is explained in<br>
Embodiment 1. A partial cross-sectional diagram of information recording medium 15 of<br>
Embodiment 1 is shown in Fig. 1. Information recording medium 15 is an optical<br>
information recording medium wherein it is possible to record and/or reproduce<br>
information by irradiating with laser beam 11.<br>
[0022] Information recording medium 15 is constituted from information layer 16 and<br>
transparent layer 13 formed on substrate 14.<br>
The material of transparent layer 13 is constituted from a resin such as a photocurable<br>
resin (particularly an ultraviolet radiation-curable resin), a slow-acting resin and the like,<br>
or a dielectric and the like, preferably with low light absorption with respect to laser beam<br>
11 being used, preferably with low optical birefringence in the short-wavelength region. In<br>
addition, a transparent disk of a resin such as polycarbonate, amorphous polyolefin, PMMA<br><br>
and the like, or glass can be used for transparent layer 13. In this case, it is possible for<br>
transparent layer 13 to be bonded to first dielectric layer 102 by using a resin such as a<br>
photocurable resin (particularly an ultraviolet radiation-curable resin) or a slow-acting<br>
resin and the like.<br>
[0023] Since the spot diameter when laser beam 11 is focused is determined by the wavelength X<br>
(the shorter the wavelength X, the smaller will be the spot diameter achievable by focusing),<br>
for high density information recording, the wavelength X of laser beam 11 is preferably a<br>
wavelength of 
layer 13 and the like becomes larger below 350 nm, a wavelength within the range of 350<br>
nm to 450 nm is more preferred.<br>
[0024] Substrate 14 is a transparent, disk-shaped substrate. Depending on the requirements, a<br>
guide groove (track pitch of 0.32 um) for guiding the laser beam can be formed in the<br>
surface of the information layer 16 side of substrate 14. On the other hand, it is preferable<br>
for a surface of substrate 14, which is the opposite side of the information layer 16 side, to<br>
be smooth.<br>
[0025] For the material of substrate 14, for example, a resin such as polycarbonate, amorphous<br>
polyolefin, PMMA and the like, or glass and the like can be used. Polycarbonate is<br>
particularly useful from the perspective of superior transcribability and mass producibility,<br>
and low cost.<br>
[0026] Furthermore, from the perspective of having sufficient strength and for the thickness of -<br>
information recording medium 15 to be on the order of 1.2 mm, a thickness for substrate 14<br>
in the range of 0.5 mm to 1.2 mm is preferred. In addition, when the thickness of<br>
transparent layer 13 is on the order of 0.6 mm (the thickness for favorable recording and<br>
reproducing operations are possible with NA = 0.6), a thickness for information recording<br>
medium 15 within the range of 5.5 mm to 6.5 mm is preferred. Moreover, when the<br>
thickness of transparent layer 13 is on the order of 0.1 mm (the thickness for favorable<br>
recording and reproducing operations are possible with NA = 0.85), a thickness for<br>
information recording medium 15 within the range of 1.05 mm to 1.15 mm is preferred.<br>
[0027] The structure of information layer 16 is explained in detail below.<br>
Arranged in order from the laser beam 11 incident side, information layer 16 comprises<br>
first dielectric layer 102, first interface layer 103, recording layer 104, second interface<br>
layer 105, second dielectric layer 106 and reflective layer 108.<br>
[0028] First dielectric layer 102 is made from a dielectric. First dielectric layer 102 acts to<br>
prevent recording layer 104 from undergoing oxidation, corrosion, deformation and the<br>
like, acts to adjust the optical path and enhance the light absorption efficiency of recording<br>
layer 104, and acts to increase the signal intensity by increasing the change in the amount<br>
of reflected light between before and after recording.<br>
[0029] For the material of first dielectric layer 102, for example, oxides such as Ti02, ZrC&gt;2,<br><br>
Hf02, ZnO, Nb205, Ta205, SiO2, Sn02, A1203, Bi203, Cr203, Ga203, ln203, Y203, Dy203<br>
and the like can be used. In addition, nitrides such as C-N, Ti-N, Zr-N, Nb-N, Ta-N, Si-N,<br>
Ge-N, Cr-N, Al-N, Ge-Si-N, Ge-Cr-N and the like can also be used. Moreover, sulfides<br>
such as ZnS and the like, carbides such as SiC and the like, fluorides such as LaF3, CeF3<br>
and the like and C can also be used. In addition, mixtures of the above materials can also<br>
be used. For example, ZnS-SiO2 that is a mixture of ZnS and SiO2 is a particularly superior<br>
material for first dielectric layer 102. ZnS-SiO2 is an amorphous material with high<br>
refractive index, rapid film deposition rate, favorable mechanical characteristics and<br>
resistance to humidity.<br>
[0030] The thickness of first dielectric layer 102 is determined exactly according to a calculation<br>
based on the matrix method, so as to satisfy conditions that increase the change in the<br>
amount of reflected light between the crystalline phase and amorphous phase of recording<br>
layer 104. Here, the thickness of first dielectric layer 102 is desirable within the range of<br>
10 nm to 150 nm, and is more desirable within the range of 30 nm to 80 nm.<br>
[0031] First interface layer 103 acts to prevent the mass transfer that arises between first<br>
dielectric layer 102 and recording layer 104 due to repeated recording.<br>
For the material of interface layer 103, in order to prevent first interface layer 103 from<br>
melting and mixing into recording layer 104 when irradiating with a high power laser beam<br>
11, materials with less light absorption capability and high melting point so as not to melt<br>
during the information recording are preferred. This is because that if the material of first<br>
interface layer 103 is mixed, a composition of recording layer 104 changes and the<br>
overwriting capability particularly deteriorates. Moreover, since adhesiveness of first<br>
interface layer 103 and recording layer 104 is essential for ensuring reliability of<br>
information recording mediuml5, the materials of good adhesiveness with recording layer<br>
104 is preferred.<br>
[0032] For specific materials of first interface layer 103, materials containing Cr and O are<br>
preferable since the crystallization of recording layer 104 is more improved. Among these,<br>
the oxide Cr203 formed from Cr and O, such as Cr203-Zr02, Cr203-Hf02, Cr203-Ga203,<br>
Cr203-In203, Cr203-Y203, Cr203-SiO2, Cr203-Zr02-SiO2, Cr203-Y203-SiO2 and the like, is<br>
preferable. Particularly, Cr203 is the material of good adhesiveness with recording layer<br>
104. On the other hand, materials containing In and O can also be used. Particularly, it is<br>
preferable to contain ln203 as an oxide. In203 is also the material of good adhesiveness<br>
with recording layer 104. Other than these materials, first interface layer 103 may also<br>
contain Ml (provided that Ml is at least one element selected from Zr, Hf, Ga, In, Y and<br>
Si) in addition to Cr and O, or M2 (provided that M2 is at least one element selected from<br>
Zr, Hf, Ga, Y, Dy and Si) in addition to In and O. As these oxides are mixed, information<br>
recording medium 15 with the superior repeat overwriting performance and high reliability<br>
is achieved even if first interface layer 103 partially contacts with recording layer 104. In<br><br>
1	order to ensure the adhesiveness with recording layer 104, a content of Cr2C&gt;3 in the oxide<br>
of Cr2C&gt;3 and Ml is preferably &gt; 10 mol%. Furthermore, a content of In203 in the oxide of<br>
I112O3-M2 is preferably &gt; 10 mol%. In addition, a content of C^Ch in the oxide of O2O3<br>
and Ml is preferably 
layer 103 (if the content of Cr203 becomes high, the amount of light absorption tends to<br>
increase).<br>
[0033] The thickness of first interface layer 103 is preferable within the range of 0.5 nm to 50<br>
nm, and is more preferable within the range of 1 nm to 10 nm so as not to decrease the<br>
change in the amount of reflected light before and after the recording at the information<br>
layer 16 due to light absorption at first interface layer 103.<br>
[0034] In the same manner as with first interface layer 103, second interface layer 105 acts to<br>
prevent any mass transfer that arises between second dielectric layer 106 and recording<br>
layer 104 due to repeated recording.<br>
For specific materials of second interface layer 105, materials containing In and O are<br>
preferable. Among these, the oxide ln203 formed from In and O, such as In203-Zr02, ln203-<br>
Hf02, In203-Ga203, In203-Y203, In203-Dy203, In203-SiO2, In203-Zr02-SiO2, In203-Y203-<br>
SiC&gt;2, In203-Dy203-SiC&gt;2, is preferable. On the other hand, materials containing Cr and O<br>
can also be used in second interface layer 105. In such the case, it is preferable to contain<br>
the oxide Cr203 formed from Cr and O. Moreover, in the same manner as with first<br>
interface layer 103, second interface layer 105 may also contain Ml in addition to Cr and<br>
O, or M2 in addition to In and O. Since there is a tendency for the adhesiveness of second<br>
interface layer 105 to be poorer than that of first interface layer 103, it is preferable that a<br>
content of Cr2C&gt;3 in the oxide of Cr203 and Ml, or a content of In203 in the oxide of ln203-<br>
M2 isof&gt;20mol%.<br>
[0035] In the same manner as with first interface layer 103, the thickness of second interface<br>
layer 105 is preferably within the range of 0.5 nm to 15 nm, and is more preferably within<br>
the range of 1 nm to 10 nm.<br>
The same series of materials as were used for first dielectric layer 102 can be used in<br>
second dielectric layer 106. Among these, Zr02, Hf02, Ga203, ln203, Cr203, SiO2, Dy203,<br>
LaF3, CeF3, or dielectrics containing these materials as a mixed state (for example, Zr02-<br>
Ga203, Zr02-In203, Dy203-ln203, Zr02-In203-Cr203, Zr02-SiO2-In203, Zr02-Cr203-LaF3,<br>
Hf02-Dy203 and the like) are particularly superior materials for second dielectric layer 106.<br>
The thickness of second dielectric layer 106 is preferably within the range of 2 nm to 75<br>
nm, and is more preferably within the range of 5 nm to 40 nm. Second dielectric layer 106<br>
with the thickness of the range enables the heat generated at recording layer 104 to<br>
effectively diffuse toward the reflective layer 108 side.<br>
[0036] Also, depending on the requirements, second dielectric layer 106 can be absent. In this<br>
case, the thicknesses of second interface layer 105 can be determined exactly according to a<br><br>
calculation based on the matrix method, so as to satisfy conditions that increase the change<br>
in the amount of reflected light between the crystalline phase and amorphous phase of<br>
recording layer 104. The thickness of second interface layer 105 is preferably within the<br>
range of 2 nm to 75 nm, and is more preferably within the range of 5 nm to 40 nm.<br>
[0037] Recording layer 104 in constituted of a material that will undergo a reversible phase-<br>
change between a crystalline phase and an amorphous phase due to irradiation with laser<br>
beam 11. Recording layer 104 can be formed from a material that includes for example Ge,<br>
Te, and M3 (provided that M3 is at least one element selected from Sb and Bi).<br>
Specifically, recording layer 104 can be formed from a material represented by<br>
GeaM3bTe3+a. Here, recording layer 104 has a favorable recording storage stability with a<br>
low transfer rate in a stable amorphous phase, and a favorable overwriting storage stability<br>
with an elevated melting point and a high transfer rate with little reduction in the<br>
crystallization speed, where it is desirable to satisfy the relationship 0 
preferable to satisfy the relationship 4 
stable and to have little reduction in the crystallization speed, satisfying the relationship<br>
1.5 
[0038] Additionally, it is also favorable for recording layer 104 to be formed from a material<br>
represented by (Ge-M4)aM3bTe3+a (provided that M4 is at least one element selected from<br>
Sn, La and Pb). When this material is used, since the element M4 that substitutes for Ge<br>
will increase the crystallizability, it is possible to obtain satisfactory erase ratios even when<br>
the thickness of recording layer 104 is thin. For element M4, Sn is more preferable. When<br>
this material is used, it is preferable for 0 
and 1.5 
recording layer 104 to be formed from another material represented by Gea(M3-M5)bTe3+a<br>
(provided that M5 is at least one element selected from In, Ga and Al). For element M5, In<br>
is more preferable. For mixing concentration of element M5, it is more preferable to be 
4% with respect to a gross composition of recording layer 104. When this material is used,<br>
it is preferable for 0 
2 
be formed from a material represented by (Ge-M4)a(M3-M5)bTe3+a. For element M4, Sn is<br>
more preferable, and for element M5, In is more preferable. For mixing concentration of<br>
element M5, it is more preferable to be 
recording layer 104. When this material is used, it is preferable for 0 
40 being more preferable), and 1.5 
addition, recording layer 104 can be formed from a material that includes Sb and M6<br>
(provided that M6 is at least one element selected from V, Mn, Ga, Ge, Se, Ag, In, Sn, Te,<br>
Pb, Bi and Au). Specifically, recording layer 104 can be formed from a material that is<br>
represented by SbcM6ioo-c (atom %). When c satisfies the relationship 50 
 <br>
reflectance difference between the crystalline state and the amorphous state of recording<br>
layer 104 of information recording medium 15 can become greater, and favorable recording<br>
and reproducing characteristics can be obtained. Among these, when 75 
crystallization speed is particularly rapid, and favorable overwriting capability with a high<br>
transfer rate can be obtained. In addition, when 50 
particularly stable, and favorable recording capability with a low transfer rate can be<br>
obtained. For other materials, recording layer 104 can be formed from irreversible phase-<br>
change materials. For the irreversible phase-change materials, for example, as disclosed in<br>
Japanese patent publication No.H7-25209 (Patent No. 2006849), a material constituted<br>
from Te-0-M7 (provided that M7 is an element such as Pd, Ge and the like) is preferable.<br>
When the recording layer is formed from the irreversible phase-change materials, an<br>
information recording medium is a write-once type in which information can be recorded<br>
one time. For such the information recording medium, the present invention is preferably<br>
applied to improve the recording sensitivity and the signal storage stability.<br>
[0039] The materials of recording layer 104 may be formed by magneto optical materials in<br>
which information is recorded, erased and/or reproduced by applying magnetic field and<br>
light . For those materials, at least one element selected from a group of rare-earth metals<br>
of Tb, Gd, Dy, Nd, and Sm, and at least one element selected from a group of transition<br>
metals of Sc, Cr, Fe, Co, and Ni can be used. Specifically, those materials are Tb-Fe, Te-<br>
Fe-Co, Gd-Fe, Gd-Fe-Co, pI-Fe-Co. Nd-Fe-Co,- Sm-Co, Tb-Fe-Ni, Gd-Tb-Fe-Co, Dy-st^<br>
Fe-Co and the like. When the recording layer is formed from magneto optical materials, a<br>
structure of the information recording medium does not always correspond to that of Fig. 1.<br>
However, the structure and the materials of the interfacel layers over the both sides of the<br>
recording layer of the present invention are preferably applied to such the the information<br>
recording medium.<br>
[0040] The thickness of recording layer 104 is preferably within the range of 6 nm to 15 nm in<br>
order to achieve high recording sensitivity for information layer 16. Even within the range,<br>
when recording layer 104 is thick, the thermal effect on the adjacent region becomes higher<br>
due to the diffusion of the heat along the in-plane direction. Moreover, when recording<br>
layer 104 is thin, the reflectance of information layer 16 becomes smaller. Consequently, it<br>
is more preferable for the film thickness of recording layer 104 to be within the range 8 nm<br>
to 13 nm.<br>
[0041] Reflective layer 108 possesses an optical function that is to increase the amount of light<br>
absorbed by recording layer 104. In addition, reflective layer 108 possesses a thermal<br>
function that is to facilitate the process of recording layer 104 becoming amorphous by<br>
rapidly diffusing any heat generated by recording layer 104. Furthermore, reflective layer<br>
108 possesses the capability of protecting multi-layer films from the use environment.<br>
[0042] For the material of reflective layer 108, simple metals with high thermal conductivity<br><br>
such as Ag, Au, Cu and Al can be used. Moreover, Al alloys where Cr, Ni, Ti and the like<br>
are added to Al, Au alloys where Cu, Cr, Nd and the like are added to Au, Ag alloys where<br>
Cu, Pd, Ga, In, Nd and the like are added to Ag, Ag alloys where Pd, Ti, Ru, Au, Ni, Nd,<br>
Ga, Ca, In, Gd and the like are added to Ag-Cu, Ag alloys where Au, Pd and the like are<br>
added to Ag-Nd, Ag alloys where Sn, Ga and the like are added to Ag-In, and alloys such<br>
as Ag-Ga-Sn, Ag-Zn-Al and Cu-Si can also be used. In particular, since Ag alloys have<br>
significant thermal conductivity, they are preferred as materials for reflective layer 108.<br>
Concentration of the added materials is preferably 
capability of reflective layer 108 to be suitable, a thickness of &gt;30 nm is preferred. Also<br>
within this range, when reflective layer 108 is thinner than 200 nm, it is possible to prevent<br>
its heat diffusion capability from being too great and the recording sensitivity of<br>
information layer 16 from decreasing. Therefore, the thickness of reflective layer 108 is<br>
desirable within the range of 30 nm to 200 nm.<br>
[0043] An interface layer (not shown) can be placed between reflecting layer 108 and second<br>
dielectric layer 106. In this case, materials that can be used for the interface layer are those<br>
that have a lower thermal conductivity than the materials described for reflecting layer 108.<br>
When an Ag alloy is used for reflecting layer 108, for example Al or an Al alloy can be<br>
used for the interface layer. Moreover, elements such as Cr, Ni, Si, C and the like, and<br>
oxides such as Ti02, Zr02, Hf02; ZnO, Nb205, Ta205, SiO2, Sn02, A1203, Bi203, Cr203,<br>
Ga203, In2C&gt;3, Y203, Dy203 and the like can be used in the interface layer. Additionally,<br>
nitrides such as C-N, Ti-N, Zr-N, Nb-N, Ta-N, Si-N, Ge-N, Cr-N, Al-N, Ge-Si-N, Ge-<br>
Cr-N and the like can be used. In addition, sulfides such as ZnS and the like, carbides such<br>
as SiC and the like, fluorides such as LaF3, CeF3 and the like and carbon can also be used.<br>
Moreover, mixtures of the above materials can also be used. Additionally, the thickness of<br>
the interface layer is preferably within the range of 2 nm to 50 nm (more preferably within<br>
the range of 2 nm to 20 nm).<br>
[0044] For information layer 16, with recording layer 104 having reflectance Rc (%) when in the<br>
crystalline phase and reflectance Ra (%) when in the amorphous phase, it is preferred when<br>
these satisfy the relation Ra 
state when information has not been recorded, so that recording and reproducing operations<br>
can be carried out in a stable manner. In addition, to obtain a larger reflectance difference<br>
(Rc-Ra) and favorable recording and reproducing characteristics, it is preferable for Rc and<br>
Ra to satisfy 0.2 
0.2<ra and></ra>
[0045] Information recording medium 15 can be manufactured by the method explained below.<br>
First, information layer 16 is laminated over substrate 14 (of thickness 1.1 mm, for<br>
example). The information layer 16 is constituted from a single-layer film or a multi-layer<br>
film, and such layers can be formed within a coating apparatus through the use of<br><br>
sequential sputtering with a sputtering target including materials of each layer.<br>
[0046] Specifically, first reflecting layer 108 is formed over substrate 14. Reflecting layer 108 is<br>
formed by sputtering with a sputtering target constituted from a metal or alloy that<br>
constitutes reflecting layer 108 in an atmosphere of Ar gas, or in an atmosphere of a gas<br>
mixture of Ar gas and a reaction gas (at least one gas selected from O2 gas and N2 gas).<br>
[0047] Next, depending on the requirements, interface layer is formed over reflecting layer 108.<br>
Interface layer is formed by sputtering with a sputtering target constituted from an element<br>
or compound that constitutes interface layer in an atmosphere of Ar gas, or in an<br>
atmosphere of a gas mixture of Ar gas and a reaction gas.<br>
[0048] Subsequently, second dielectric layer 106 is formed over reflective layer 108 or interface<br>
layer. Second dielectric layer 106 is formed by sputtering with a sputtering target<br>
constituted from an element or compound that constitutes second dielectric layer 106 in an<br>
atmosphere of Ar gas, or in an atmosphere of a gas mixture of Ar gas and a reaction gas.<br>
Moreover, second dielectric layer 106 is formed by reactive sputtering with a sputtering<br>
target constituted from a metal that constitutes second dielectric layer 106 in an atmosphere<br>
of a gas mixture of Ar gas and a reaction gas.<br>
[0049] Next, second interface layer 105 is formed over reflective layer 108, interface layer or<br>
second dielectric layer 106. Second interface layer 105 can be formed in substantially the<br>
same manner as for second dielectric layer 106.<br>
Next, recording layer 104 is formed over second interface layer 105. Depending on its<br>
composition, recording layer 104 can be formed by sputtering with the use of a single<br>
power source with a sputtering target constituted from Ge-Te-M3 alloy, or a sputtering<br>
target constituted from Ge-M4-Te-M3 alloy, or a sputtering target constituted from Sb-M6<br>
alloy.<br>
[0050] For the atmosphere gas used for sputtering, Ar gas, Kr gas, a gas mixture with Ar gas and<br>
a reaction gas, or a gas mixture with Kr gas and a reaction gas can be used. Moreover,<br>
recording layer 104 can be formed by simultaneous sputtering with the use of a plurality of<br>
power sources from various sputtering targets of Ge, Te, M3, M4, Sb or M6. In addition,<br>
recording layer 104 can be formed by simultaneous sputtering with the use of a plurality of<br>
power sources from a binary sputtering target or a ternary sputtering target and the like that<br>
combines any of the elements from Ge, Te, M3, M4, Sb or M6. In these cases also, the<br>
recording layer can be formed by sputtering in an atmosphere of Ar gas, an atmosphere of<br>
Kr gas, an atmosphere of a gas mixture with Ar gas and a reaction gas, or an atmosphere of<br>
a gas mixture with Kr gas and a reaction gas can be used.<br>
[0051] Next, first interface layer 103 is formed over recording layer 104. First interface layer<br>
103 can be formed in substantially the same manner as for second dielectric layer 106.<br>
Next, first dielectric layer 102 is formed over first interface layer 103. First dielectric<br>
layer 102 can be formed in substantially the same manner as for second dielectric layer<br><br>
106.<br>
[0052] Finally, transparent layer 13 is formed over first dielectric layer 102. Transparent layer 13<br>
can be formed over first dielectric layer 102 by applying a photocurable resin (particularly<br>
an ultraviolet radiation-curable resin) or a slow-acting resin as a spin coating, after which<br>
the resin is cured. Additionally, it is also suitable to use a transparent disk of a resin such as<br>
polycarbonate, amorphous polyolefin, PMMA and the like, or a substrate of glass and the<br>
like for transparent layer 13. In this case, transparent layer 13 can be formed by applying a<br>
resin such as a photocurable resin (particularly an ultraviolet radiation-curable resin) or a<br>
slow-acting resin and the like over first dielectric layer 102, and after the substrate is<br>
bonded over first dielectric layer 102 by spin coating the resin is cured. Moreover, an<br>
adhesive resin is applied uniformly to the substrate beforehand, and this can be bonded to<br>
first dielectric layer 102.<br>
[0053] Furthermore, after first dielectric layer 102 is formed, or after transparent layer 13 is<br>
formed, depending on the requirements it is also favorable to carry out an initialization<br>
process in which the entire recording layer 104 is crystallized. The crystallization of<br>
recording layer 104 can be carried out by irradiating with a laser beam.<br>
[0054] Information recording medium 15 can be manufactured in the above manner. Furthermore,<br>
while each of the layers is formed by using the sputtering method in the present<br>
embodiment, the embodiment is not limited to this method and it is also possible to use a<br>
- vacuum deposition method, an ion plating method, a CVD method, an MBE method and the<br>
like.<br>
[0055] In addition, the order of forming each layers are not limited to the above-mentioned<br>
order.<br>
(Embodiment 2)<br>
An example of an information recording medium of the present invention is explained in<br>
Embodiment 2. A partial cross-sectional diagram of information recording medium 22 of<br>
Embodiment 2 is shown in Fig. 2. Information recording medium 22 is an optical<br>
information recording medium wherein it is possible to record and/or reproduce<br>
information by irradiating with laser beam 11.<br>
[0056] Information recording medium 22 is constituted on substrate 14 from N groups (where N<br>
is a natural number that satisfies N &gt; 2) of information layers 21 and 18, first information<br>
layer 23 and transparent layer 13 through sequential lamination of optical separation layers<br>
20, 19, 17 and the like. Here, the first information layer 23 and information layer 18, which<br>
are not over (N-l)' phase from the laser beam 11 incident side (the Nth information layer<br>
counting from the laser beam 11 incident side is referred to below as the Nth information<br>
layer), are transparent-type information layers. Substantially the same materials as were<br>
used in Embodiment 1 can be used in substrate 14 and transparent layer 13. In addition,<br>
these will also have substantially the same form and function as was explained in<br><br>
Embodiment 1.<br>
[0057] The material of optical separation layers 20, 19, 17 and the like is constituted from a resin<br>
such as a photocurable resin (particularly an ultraviolet radiation-curable resin) or a slow-<br>
acting resin as well as a dielectric and the like, preferably with low light absorption with<br>
respect to laser beam 11 being used, and preferably with low optical birefringence in the<br>
short-wavelength region.<br>
[0058] Optical separation layers 20, 19, 17 and the like are layers that are provided in order to<br>
differentiate the corresponding focus positions for first information layer 23, information<br>
layers 18 and 21 and the like for information recording medium 22. It is necessary for the<br>
thickness of optical separation layers 20, 19, 17 and the like to be greater than or equal to<br>
that is the focal depth (AZ) that is determined by the numerical aperture (NA) of the<br>
objective lens and the wavelength of laser beam 11 (A,). When the standard focal point<br>
intensity can be assumed to be 80% of the aplanatic case, AZ can be approximated by AZ =<br>
A,/[2(NA)2]. When X = 405 nm and NA = 0.85, AZ equals to 0.280 um, and if AZ is within ±<br>
0.3 um from the value, it is still said to be within the focal depth. For this reason, it is<br>
necessary in this case for the thickness of optical separation layers 20, 19, 17 and the like<br>
to be &gt;0.6 um. It is desirable for the path between first information layer 23, and<br>
information layers 18, 21 and the like to be within the focusable range of laser beam 11<br>
used for the objective lens. Consequently, the total thickness of optical separation layers<br>
20, 19, 17 and the like are preferably within the tolerance allowable for the objective lens<br>
(for example, 
[0059] Depending on the requirements, it is satisfactory to form a guide groove to guide the laser<br>
beam on the surface of laser beam 11 incident side of optical separation layers 20, 19, 17<br>
and the like.<br>
In this case, with laser beam 11 irradiating from only one side, it is possible to carry out<br>
recording and reproducing operations with laser beam 11 on the Kth information layer<br>
(where K is a natural number such that 1 
first through (K-l)1 information layers.<br>
[0060] Furthermore, any one from the first information layer to the Nth first information layer<br>
can also be an information layer for dedicated reproducing use (ROM, Read Only<br>
Memory), as well as a write-once information layer (WO, Write Once) that can only be<br>
recorded upon a single time<br>
[0061] The structure of first information layer 23 is explained in detail below.<br>
First information layer 23 is provided with third dielectric layer 202, third interface layer<br>
203, first recording layer 204, fourth interface layer 205, first reflecting layer 208, and<br>
adjustable transmittance layer 209, positioned in order from the laser beam 11 incident<br>
side.<br>
[0062] Materials substantially the same as those in first dielectric layer 102 of Embodiment 1<br><br>
can be used in third dielectric layer 202. Additionally, the function of third dielectric layer<br>
202 is substantially the same as for first dielectric layer 102 of Embodiment 1.<br>
[0063] In general, the thicknesses of third dielectric layer 202 can be determined exactly<br>
according to a calculation based on the matrix method, so as to satisfy conditions that<br>
increase the change in the amount of reflected light between the crystalline phase and<br>
amorphous phase of first recording layer 204, increase the light absorption in recording<br>
layer 204, and increase the transmittance of first information layer 23.<br>
[0064] Materials substantially the same as those used for first interface layer 103 in Embodiment<br>
1 can be used in third interface layer 203. Moreover, the function and form of the interface<br>
layer 203 will also be substantially the same as for first interface layer 103 in Embodiment<br>
1.<br>
[0065] Fourth interface layer 205 adjusts the optical path and acts to elevate the light absorption<br>
efficiency of first recording layer 204, and has the function of increasing the magnitude in<br>
the change in the amount of reflected light before and after recording and to increase the<br>
signal intensity.<br>
The same series of materials as was used in second interface layer 105 in Embodiment 1<br>
can be used in fourth interface layer 205. In addition, the thickness of fourth interface layer<br>
205 is preferably within the range of 0.5 nm to 75 nm, and is more preferably within the<br>
range of 1 nm to 40 nm. By selecting a thickness for fourth interface layer 205 within this<br>
range, any heat generated in first recording layer 204 can be effectively dissipated on the<br>
side of first reflective layer 208.<br>
[0066] Furthermore, fourth dielectric layer 206 can be positioned between fourth interface layer<br>
205 and first reflective layer 208 in first information layer 23. Substantially the same series<br>
of materials as was used in third dielectric layer 202 can be used in fourth dielectric layer<br>
206. Particularly, materials containing In and O are preferable.<br>
[0067] First recording layer 204 is constituted from a material that undergoes a phase-change<br>
between a crystalline phase and an amorphous phase due to irradiation with laser beam 11.<br>
First recording layer 204 can be formed, for example, from a material that includes Ge, Te,<br>
or M3. Specifically, first recording layer 204 can be formed from a material that can be<br>
represented by the composition formula GeaM3bTe3+a. When a satisfies the relationship 0 
a 
transfer rate and favorable overwriting capability with a high transfer rate can be obtained.<br>
It is more preferable to satisfy the relationship 4 
phase to be stable and to have little reduction in the crystallization speed, it is preferable to<br>
satisfy the relationship 1.5 

[0068] Additionally, first recording layer 204 can be formed from a material that can be<br>
represented by the composition formula (Ge-M4)aM3bTe3+a. When this material is used,<br><br>
1	since the element M3 that substitutes for Ge will increase the crystallizability, it is possible<br>
to obtain satisfactory erase ratios even when the thickness of first recording layer 204 is<br>
thin. For element M4, Sn is more preferable from the perspective of being less toxic. When<br>
this material is used, it is preferable for 0 
and 1.5 
[0069] For first information layer 23, in order to achieve the required quantity of laser beam for<br>
the recording and reproducing operations in the information layer on the side more distal<br>
than first information layer 23 from the laser beam 11 incident side, and to make the laser<br>
beam reach the information layer on the side more distal than first information layer 23,<br>
first information layer 23 must have high transmittance. Therefore, the thickness of first<br>
recording layer 204 is preferable 
8 nm.<br>
[0070] First reflecting layer 208 possesses an optical function that is to increase the amount of<br>
light absorbed by first recording layer 204. Moreover, first reflective layer 208 possesses a<br>
thermal function of rapidly diffusing any heat generated by first recording layer 204 and to<br>
facilitate the process of first recording layer 204 becoming amorphous. Furthermore,<br>
reflective layer 208 possesses the function of protecting multi-layer films from the use<br>
environment.<br>
[0071] Substantially the same materials as were used for reflective layer 108 in Embodiment 1<br>
can be used in first reflective layer 208. Additionally, the function of first reflective layer<br>
208 is substantially the same as for reflective layer 108 of Embodiment 1. In particular,<br>
since Ag alloys have significant thermal conductivity, they are preferred as materials for<br>
first reflective layer 208.<br>
[0072] In order for first information layer 23 to have the highest possible transmittance, the<br>
thickness of first reflective layer 208 is preferably within the range of 3 nm to 15 nm, and<br>
is more preferably within the range of 8 nm to 12 nm. When first reflective layer 208 has a<br>
thickness within this range, its heat diffusion function will be suitable, and it will be able to<br>
maintain the reflectance of first information layer 23, and furthermore the transmittance of<br>
first information layer 23 will be suitable.<br>
[0073] Adjustable transmittance layer 209 is constituted from a dielectric, and functions to adjust<br>
the transmittance of first information layer 23. Adjustable transmittance layer 209 makes it<br>
possible to achieve both a higher transmittance Tc (%) of first information layer 23 when<br>
first recording layer 204 is in a crystalline phase and a higher transmittance Ta (%) of first<br>
information layer 23 when first recording layer 204 is in an amorphous phase. Specifically,<br>
the level of transmittance in first information layer 23 is raised by from 2% to 10% when it<br>
is provided with adjustable transmittance layer 209 as compared to when the adjustable<br>
transmittance layer 209 is absent. In addition, adjustable transmittance layer 209 also<br>
functions effectively to diffuse any heat generated in first recording layer 204.<br><br>
'[0074] In order to raise the transmittances Tc and Ta of first information layer 23 higher, it is<br>
preferable for the refractive index n and extinction coefficient k of adjustable transmittance<br>
layer 209 to satisfy the conditions 2.0 
the conditions 2.4 
[0075] The thickness d of adjustable transmittance layer 209 is preferably within the range<br>
(l/32)A7n 
range (l/16)A,/n 
wavelength X of laser beam 11 and refractive index n of adjustable transmittance layer 209,<br>
for example, by selecting 350 nm 
abovementioned ranges to be 3 nm 
preferable for the ranges to be 7 nm 
within these ranges, both the transmittances Tc and Ta of first information layer 23 can be<br>
higher.<br>
[0076] Oxides such as Ti02, Zr02, Hf02, ZnO, Nb205, Ta205, SiO2, Al203, Bi203, Cr203, Ga203j<br>
ln203, Y203, Dy203, Sr-O and the like can be used as the material for adjustable<br>
transmittance layer 209. Additionally, nitrides such as Ti-N, Zr-N, Nb-N, Ta-N, Si-N, Ge-<br>
N, Cr-N, Al-N, Ge-Si-N, Ge-Cr-N and the like can be used. Moreover, sulfides such as ZnS<br>
can be used. In addition, mixtures of the above materials can also be used. Among these, in<br>
particular Ti02 and materials including Ti02 are preferred. Since materials such as these<br>
have a higher refractive index (n = 2.6 to 2.8), a small extinction coefficient (k = 0.0 to<br>
0.05), this also raises the transmittance of first information layer 23 higher.<br>
[0077] The transmittance Tc and Ta of first information layer 23 preferably satisfy the condition<br>
40 
record on and/or reproduce from the information layer, to reach the information layer on<br>
the side more distal than first information layer 23 from the laser beam 11 incident side. It<br>
is more preferable for them to satisfy 46 
[0078] Transmittances Ta and Tc of first information layer 23 preferably satisfy the condition -5<br>
satisfy these conditions, there is a smaller effect of the change in transmittance due to the<br>
status of first recording layer 204 in first information layer 23 during recording and<br>
reproducing operations of the information layer on the side more distal than first<br>
information layer 23 from the laser beam 11 incident side, and favorable recording and<br>
reproducing characteristics are obtained.<br>
[0079] In first information layer 23, for reflectance Rci (%) when first recording layer 204 is in a<br>
crystalline phase and reflectance Rai (%) when first recording layer 204 is in an amorphous<br>
phase, it is preferable if the condition Rai<rci is satisfied. when this the case></rci>
reflectance is high in the initial state when information has not been recorded, so that<br>
recording and reproducing operations can be carried out in a stable manner. In addition, to<br><br>
obtain a larger reflectance difference (Rci-Rai) and favorable recording and reproducing<br>
characteristics, it is preferable for Rci and Rai to satisfy 0.1 
it is more preferable for them to satisfy 0.1 
[0080] Information recording medium 22 can be manufactured by the method explained below.<br>
First, information layers of N-l layers are laminated sequentially with optical separation<br>
layers therebetween over substrate 14 (for example, with a thickness of 1.1 mm). The<br>
information layer is constituted from a single-layer film or a multi-layer film, and such<br>
layers can be formed within a coating apparatus through the use of sequential sputtering<br>
with a sputtering target constituted from the material.<br>
[0081] Additionally, the optical separation layers can be formed by applying a resin such as a<br>
photocurable resin (particularly an ultraviolet radiation-curable resin) or a slow-acting<br>
resin and the like over the information layer, after which substrate 14 is rotated so that the<br>
resin extends uniformly (spin coating) and then the resin is cured. Furthermore, when the<br>
optical separation layer is provided with a guide groove for laser beam 11, the guide groove<br>
can be formed by bonding a resin to a substrate (mold) that forms the groove prior to<br>
curing, followed by the mold covered with the substrate 14 being rotated to perform spin<br>
coating, and removing the substrate (mold) after the resin is cured.<br>
[0082] After laminating information layers of N-l layers with optical separation layers<br>
therebetween over substrate 14, proceeding in this manner prepares for forming optical<br>
separation layer 17.<br>
Next, first information layer 23 is formed over optical separation layer 17. Specifically,<br>
after first being laminated with N-l layers using information layers and optical separation<br>
layers, substrate 14 with formed optical separation layer 17 is positioned within a coating<br>
apparatus and adjustable transmittance layer 209 is formed over optical separation layer 17.<br>
Adjustable transmittance layer 209 can be formed in substantially the same manner as for<br>
second dielectric layer 106 in Embodiment 1.<br>
[0083] Next, first reflective layer "1.08 is formed over adjustable transmittance layer 209. First<br>
reflective layer TO8 can be formed in substantially the same manner as for second reflective<br>
layer'lOS in Embodiment 1.<br>
Next, fourth dielectric layer 206 is formed over first reflective layer 208. Fourth<br>
dielectric layer 206 can be formed in substantially the same manner as for second dielectric<br>
layer 106 in Embodiment 1.<br>
[0084] Next, fourth interface layer 205 is formed over first reflective layer 208 or fourth<br>
dielectric layer 206. Fourth interface layer 205 can be formed in substantially the same<br>
manner as for second dielectric layer 106 in Embodiment 1.<br>
[0085] Next, first recording layer 204 is formed over fourth interface layer 205. First recording<br>
layer 204 can be formed in substantially the same manner as for recording layer 104 in<br>
Embodiment 1, by using a sputtering target that corresponds to its composition.<br><br>
•.J<br>
[0086] Next, third interface layer 203 is formed over first recording layer 204. Third interface<br>
layer 203 can be formed in substantially the same manner as for second dielectric layer 106<br>
in Embodiment 1.<br>
Next, third dielectric layer 202 is formed over third interface layer 203. Third dielectric<br>
layer 202 can be formed in substantially the same manner as for second dielectric layer 106<br>
in Embodiment 1.<br>
[0087] Finally, transparent layer 13 is formed over third dielectric layer 202. Transparent layer<br>
13 is formed by the method explained in Embodiment 1.<br>
Furthermore, after third dielectric layer 202 is formed, or after transparent layer 13 is<br>
formed, depending on the requirements, it is also favorable to carry out an initialization<br>
process in which the entire first recording layer 204 is crystallized. The crystallization of<br>
first recording layer 204 can be carried out by irradiating with a laser beam.<br>
[0088] Information recording medium 22 can be manufactured in the above manner. Furthermore,<br>
while each of the layers is formed by using the sputtering method in the present<br>
embodiment, the embodiment is not limited to this method and it is also possible to use a<br>
vacuum deposition method, an ion plating method, a CVD method, an MBE method and the<br>
like.<br>
[0089] In addition, the order of forming each layers are not limited to the above-mentioned<br>
order.<br>
(Embodiment 3)<br>
In Embodiment 3, N = 2 in the multilayer optical information recording medium of the<br>
present invention in Embodiment 2, in other words an example of an information recording<br>
medium that uses biphasic information layers is explained. A partial cross-sectional<br>
diagram of information recording medium 24 of Embodiment 3 is shown in Fig. 3.<br>
Information recording medium 24 is a bilayer optical information recording medium<br>
wherein it is possible to record and/or reproduce information by irradiating with laser beam<br>
11 from one side.<br>
[0090] Information recording medium 24 is constituted from second information layer 25, optical<br>
separation layer 17, first information layer 23 and transparent layer 13 that are sequentially<br>
laminated over substrate 14. Materials substantially the same as those in the explanations in<br>
Embodiments 1 and 2 can be used in substrate 14, optical separation layer 17, first<br>
information layer 23 and transparent layer 13. In addition, these will also have substantially<br>
the same form and function as was explained in Embodiments 1 and 2.<br>
[0091] The structure of second information layer 25 is explained in detail below.<br>
Second information layer 25 is provided with first dielectric layer 302, first interface<br>
layer 303, second recording layer 304, second interface layer 305, second dielectric layer<br>
306 and second reflecting layer 308, positioned in order from the laser beam 11 incident<br>
side. Recording and reproducing operations can be carried out on second information layer<br><br>
25 by using laser beam 11 that passes through transparent layer 13, first information layer<br>
23 and optical separation layer 17.<br>
[0092] Substantially the same materials as were used in first dielectric layer 102 of Embodiment<br>
1 can be used in first dielectric layer 302. Additionally, the function of first dielectric layer<br>
302 is substantially the same as for first dielectric layer 102 of Embodiment 1.<br>
[0093] In general, the thicknesses of first dielectric layer 302 can be determined exactly<br>
according to a calculation based on the matrix method, so as to satisfy conditions that<br>
increase the change in the amount of reflected light between the crystalline phase and<br>
amorphous phase of second recording layer 304.<br>
[0094] Substantially the same materials as were used for first interface layer 103 in Embodiment<br>
1 can be used in first interface layer 303. Moreover, the function and form of the interface<br>
layer will also be substantially the same as was explained for first interface layer 103 in<br>
Embodiment 1.<br>
[0095] Substantially the same materials as were used for second interface layer 105 in<br>
Embodiment 1 can be used in second interface layer 305. Moreover, the function and form<br>
of the interface layer will also be substantially the same as was explained for second<br>
interface layer 105 in Embodiment 1.<br>
[0096] Substantially the same materials used in second dielectric layer 106 of Embodiment 1 can<br>
be used in second dielectric layer 306. Additionally, the function and form of the dielectric<br>
layer will also be substantially the same as for second dielectric layer 106 of Embodiment<br>
1.<br>
[0097] Second recording layer 304 can be formed from substantially the same materials as were<br>
used for recording layer 104 of Embodiment 1. The thickness of second recording layer 304<br>
is preferably within the range of 6 nm to 15 nm in order to achieve high recording<br>
sensitivity for second information layer 25. Even within the range, when recording layer<br>
304 is thick, the thermal effect on the adjacent region becomes higher due to the diffusion<br>
of the heat along the in-plane direction. Moreover, when second recording layer 304 is thin,<br>
the reflectance of second information layer 25 becomes smaller. Consequently, it is more<br>
preferable for the film thickness of second recording layer 304 to be within the range 8 nm<br>
to 13 nm.<br>
[0098] Substantially the same materials as were used for reflective layer 108 in Embodiment 1<br>
can be used in second reflective layer 308. Moreover, the function and form of the interface<br>
layer will also be substantially the same as was explained for reflective layer 108 in<br>
Embodiment 1.<br>
[0099] An interface layer can be placed between second reflecting layer 308 and second<br>
dielectric layer 306. For the interface layer, substantially the same materials as were used<br>
for the interface layer in Embodiment 1 can be used. In addition, these will also have<br>
substantially the same form and function as the interface layer in Embodiment 1.<br><br>
[0100] Information recording medium 24 can be manufactured by the method explained below.<br>
First, second information layer 25 is formed.<br>
Specifically, substrate 14 (for example, of thickness 1.1 mm) is first prepared and is<br>
positioned within a coating apparatus.<br>
[0101] Next, second reflective layer 308 is formed over substrate 14. At this time, if a guide<br>
groove for the purpose of guiding laser beam 11 is to be formed on substrate 14, second<br>
reflective layer 308 is formed on the side where the guide groove is formed. Second<br>
reflective layer 308 can be formed in substantially the same manner as for reflective layer<br>
108 in Embodiment 1.<br>
[0102] Next, interface layer 207 is formed over second reflective layer 308. Interface layer 207<br>
can be formed in substantially the same manner as for second dielectric layer 106 in<br>
Embodiment 1.<br>
Next, second dielectric layer 306 is formed over second reflective layer 308 or interface<br>
layer. Second dielectric layer 306 can be formed in substantially the same manner as for<br>
second dielectric layer 106 in Embodiment 1.<br>
[0103] Next, second interface layer 305 is formed over second reflective layer 308, interface<br>
layer or second dielectric layer 306. Second interface layer 305 can be formed in<br>
substantially the same manner as for second dielectric layer 106 in Embodiment 1.<br>
[0104] Next, second recording layer 304 is formed over second interface layer 305. Second<br>
recording-layer 304 can be formed in substantially the same manner as for recording-layer<br>
104 in Embodiment 1, by using a sputtering target that corresponds to its composition.<br>
[0105] Next, first interface layer 303 is formed over second recording layer 304. First interface<br>
layer 303 can be formed in substantially the same manner as for second dielectric layer 106<br>
in Embodiment 1.<br>
Next, first dielectric layer 302 is formed over second interface layer 303. First dielectric<br>
layer 302 can be formed in substantially the same manner as for second dielectric layer 106<br>
in Embodiment 1.<br>
[0106] Then, Next, optical separation layer 17 is formed over first dielectric layer 302 of second<br>
information layer 25. Optical separation layer 17 can be formed over first dielectric layer<br>
302 by applying a photocurable resin (particularly an ultraviolet radiation-curable resin) or<br>
a slow-acting resin as a spin coating, after which the resin is cured. Furthermore, when<br>
optical separation layer 17 is provided with a guide groove for laser beam 11, the guide<br>
groove can be formed by bonding resin to a substrate (mold) that forms the groove prior to<br>
curing, after which the resin is cured and then the substrate (mold) is taken up.<br>
[0107] Moreover, after second dielectric layer 302 is formed, or after optical separation layer 17<br>
is formed, depending on the requirements it is also suitable to carry out an initialization<br>
process in which the entire second recording layer 304 is crystallized. The crystallization of<br>
second recording layer 304 can be carried out by irradiating with laser beam 11.<br><br>
[0108] Next, first information layer 23 is formed over optical separation layer 17.<br>
Specifically, films of adjustable transmittance layer 209, first reflective layer 208, fourth<br>
interface layer 205, first recording layer 204, third interface layer 203 and third dielectric<br>
layer 202 are first formed in order over optical separation layer 17. At this time, fourth<br>
dielectric layer 206 can be formed between first reflective layer 208 and fourth interface<br>
layer 205. Each of these layers can be formed by methods explained in Embodiment 2.<br>
[0109] Finally, transparent layer 13 is formed over third dielectric layer 202. Transparent layer<br>
13 is formed by the method explained in Embodiment 1.<br>
Furthermore, after third dielectric layer 202 is formed, or after transparent layer 13 is<br>
formed, depending on the requirements it is also favorable to carry out an initialization<br>
process in which the entire first recording layer 204 is crystallized. The crystallization of<br>
first recording layer 204 can be carried out by irradiating with a laser beam.<br>
[0110] Additionally, after third dielectric layer 202 is formed, or after transparent layer 13 is<br>
formed, depending on the requirements it is also favorable to carry out an initialization<br>
process in which the entire second recording layer 304 and first recording layer 204 are<br>
crystallized. In this case, if the crystallization of first recording layer 204 is carried out<br>
first, there is a tendency for the laser power required to crystallize second recording layer<br>
304 to grow larger, so that it is preferable for second recording layer 304 to be crystallized<br>
first.<br>
[0111] Information recording medium 24 can be manufactured in the above manner. Furthermore,<br>
while each of the layers is formed by using the sputtering method in the present<br>
embodiment, the embodiment is not limited to this method and it is also possible to use a<br>
vacuum deposition method, an ion plating method, a CVD method, an MBE method and the<br>
like.<br>
[0112] In addition, the order of forming each layers are not limited to the above-mentioned<br>
order.<br>
(Embodiment 4)<br>
Another example of an information recording medium of the present invention is<br>
explained in Embodiment 4. A partial cross-sectional diagram of information recording<br>
medium 29 of Embodiment 4 is shown in Fig. 4. Like the information recording medium 15<br>
of Embodiment 1, information recording medium 29 is an optical information recording<br>
medium wherein it is possible to record and/or reproduce information by irradiating with<br>
laser beam 11.<br>
[0113] Information recording medium 29 is constituted from substrate 26 over which information<br>
layer 16 and dummy substrate 28 have been laminated, where these are bonded together<br>
through adhesive layer 27.<br>
Substrate 26 and dummy substrate 28 are transparent disk-shaped plates. Resins such as<br>
polycarbonate, amorphous polyolefinPMMA and the like, or glass and the like can be used<br><br>
in substrate 26 and dummy substrate 28, in substantially the same manner as for substrate<br>
14 in Embodiment 1.<br>
[0114] Depending on the requirements, a guide groove (track pitch: 0.615 (xm) for guiding a laser<br>
beam can be formed on the surface of first dielectric layer 102 side of substrate 26. It is<br>
preferable for the surface of substrate 26, which is the opposite side of the first dielectric<br>
layer 102 side, and the surface of dummy substrate 28, which is the opposite side of the<br>
adhesive layer 27 side, to be smooth. For the material of substrate 26 and dummy substrate<br>
28, polycarbonate is particularly useful from the perspective of superior transcribability,<br>
mass producibility and low cost. Furthermore, the thickness of substrate 26 and dummy<br>
substrate 28 is preferably within the range of 0.3 nm to 0.9 nm, so as to these substrates<br>
have enough strength and the thickness of information recording medium 29 becomes 1.2<br>
mm.<br>
[0115] Adhesive layer 27 is constituted from a resin such as a photocurable resin (particularly an<br>
ultraviolet radiation-curable resin) or a slow-acting resin that preferably has low light<br>
absorption for laser beam 11 that is used, and preferably has low optical birefringence in<br>
the short-wavelength region. Furthermore, the thickness of adhesive layer 27 is preferably<br>
within the range of 0.6 um to 50 um because of the same reasons in the cases of optical<br>
separation layer 19 and 17.<br>
[0116] In addition, where a component is identified by the same symbol as was used in<br>
Embodiment 1, it will be omitted from the explanation.<br>
Information recording medium 29 can be manufactured by the method explained below.<br>
First, information layer 16 is formed over substrate 26 (of thickness 0.6 mm, for<br>
example). At this time, if a guide groove for the purpose of guiding laser beam 11 is to be<br>
formed in substrate 26, information layer 16 is formed on the side where the guide groove<br>
is formed. Specifically, substrate 26 is positioned within a coating apparatus, and first<br>
dielectric layer 102, first interface layer 103, recording layer 104, second interface layer<br>
105, second dielectric layer 106 and reflective layer 108 are laminated on sequentially.<br>
Furthermore, depending on the requirements, an interface layer is formed between second<br>
dielectric layer 106 and reflective layer 108. Also, depending on the requirements, second<br>
dielectric layer 106 can be absent. The methods for forming the films of the various layers<br>
are substantially the same as in Embodiment 1. Furthermore, the thickness of first dielectric<br>
layer 102 is desirable within the range of 50 nm to 250 nm, and is more desirable within<br>
the range of 80 nm to 180 nm. Also, the thickness of second dielectric layer 106 is<br>
desirable within the range of 10 nm to 100 nm, and is more desirable within the range of 20<br>
nm to 70 nm. When second dielectric layer 106 is not formed, the thickness of second<br>
interface layer 105 is desirable within the range of 10 nm to 100 nm, and is more preferable<br>
within the range of 20 nm to 70 nm.<br>
[0117] Next, substrate 26 with laminated information layer 16 and dummy substrate 28 (for<br><br>
/	example, of thickness 0.6 mm) are bonded together using adhesive layer 27. Specifically, a<br>
resin such as a photocurable resin (particularly an ultraviolet radiation-curable resin) or a<br>
slow-acting resin is applied to dummy substrate 28, and after dummy substrate 28 with the<br>
adhering spin coating is bonded to substrate 26 with laminated information layer 16, the<br>
resin can be cured. Moreover, an adhesive resin is uniformly applied over dummy substrate<br>
28 beforehand, so that this can be bonded to substrate 26 with laminated information layer<br>
16.<br>
[0118] Furthermore, after substrate 26 and dummy substrate 28 are bonded together, depending<br>
on the requirements, an initialization process can be carried out in which the entire<br>
recording layer 104 is crystallized. The crystallization of recording layer 104 can be carried<br>
out by irradiating with a laser beam.<br>
[0119] Information recording medium 29 can be manufactured in the above manner. Furthermore,<br>
while each of the layers is formed by using the sputtering method in the present<br>
embodiment, the embodiment is not limited to this method and it is also possible to use a<br>
vacuum deposition method, an ion plating method, a CVD method, an MBE method and the<br>
like.<br>
[0120] In addition, the order of forming each layers are not limited to the above-mentioned<br>
order.<br>
(Embodiment 5)<br>
An example of an information recording medium of the present invention is explained in<br>
Embodiment 5. A partial cross-sectional diagram of information recording medium 31 of<br>
Embodiment 5 is shown in Fig. 5. Information recording medium 31 is a multilayer optical<br>
information recording medium wherein it is possible to record and/or reproduce<br>
information by means of irradiating with laser beam 11 from one side in substantially the<br>
same manner as for information recording medium 22 of Embodiment 2.<br>
[0121] Information recording medium 31 is constituted from N phases of first information layer<br>
23 and information layer 18 sequentially laminated with optical separation layers 17, 19<br>
and the like over substrate 26 and information layer 21 laminated over substrate 30 that are<br>
bonded together through adhesive layer 27.<br>
[0122] Substrate 30 is a transparent, disk-shaped substrate. In substantially the same manner as<br>
for substrate 14, for example, polycarbonate, amorphous polyolefin, PMMA and the like, or<br>
glass can be used in substrate 30.<br>
[0123] Depending on the requirements, a guide groove for guiding the laser beam can be formed<br>
in the surface of the information layer 21 side of substrate 30. It is preferable for a surface<br>
of substrate 30, which is the opposite side of the information layer 21 side, to be smooth.<br>
For the material of substrate 30, polycarbonate is particularly useful from the perspective<br>
of superior transcribability and mass producibility, and low cost. Furthermore, the<br>
thickness of substrate 30 is preferable within the range of 0.3 mm to 0.9 mm from the<br><br>
perspective of having sufficient strength and for the thickness of information recording<br>
medium 31 to be on the order of 1.2 mm.<br>
[0124] In addition, where a component is identified by the same symbol as was used in<br>
Embodiments 2 and 4, it will be omitted from the explanation.<br>
Information recording medium 31 can be manufactured by the method explained below.<br>
[0125] First information layer 23 is first formed over substrate 26 (of thickness 0.6 mm, for<br>
example). At this time, if a guide groove for the purpose of guiding laser beam 11 is to be<br>
formed in substrate 26, first information layer 23 is formed on the side where the guide<br>
groove is formed. Specifically, substrate 26 is positioned within a coating apparatus, and<br>
third dielectric layer 202, third interface layer 203, first recording layer 204, fourth<br>
interface layer 205, first reflective layer 208 and adjustable transmittance layer 209 are<br>
laminated on sequentially. Furthermore, depending on the requirements, fourth dielectric<br>
layer 206 can be formed between fourth interface layer 205 and first reflective layer 208.<br>
The methods for forming the films of the various layers are substantially the same as in<br>
Embodiment 2. Later, (N-2) information layers are laminated sequentially thorough optical<br>
separation layers.<br>
[0126] Additionally, information layer 21 is formed over substrate 30 (of thickness 0.6 mm, for<br>
example). The information layer is constituted from a single-layer film or a multi-layer film,<br>
and such layers can be formed substantially as in Embodiment 2, within a coating apparatus<br>
through the use of sequential sputtering with a sputtering target composed of the material.<br>
[0127] Finally, substrate 26 with a laminated information layer and substrate 30 are bonded<br>
together through adhesive layer 27. Specifically, a resin such as a photocurable resin<br>
(particularly an ultraviolet radiation-curable resin) or a slow-acting resin is applied over<br>
information layer 21, and after the spin coating adhering over information layer 21 is<br>
bonded to substrate 26 having information layer 23 formed thereon, the resin can be cured.<br>
Additionally, an adhesive resin was uniformly applied over information layer 21<br>
beforehand, so that this can be bonded to substrate 26.<br>
[0128] Moreover, after substrate 26 and substrate 30 are bonded together, depending on the<br>
requirements, an initialization process can be carried out in which the entire first recording<br>
layer 204 is crystallized. The crystallization of first recording layer 204 can be carried out<br>
by irradiating with a laser beam.<br>
[0129] Information recording medium 31 can be manufactured in the above manner. Furthermore,<br>
while each of the layers is formed by using the sputtering method in the present<br>
embodiment, the embodiment is not limited to this method and it is also possible to use a<br>
vacuum deposition method, an ion plating method, a CVD method, an MBE method and the<br>
like.<br>
[0130] In addition, the order of forming each layers are not limited to the above-mentioned<br>
order.<br><br>
(Embodiment 6)<br>
In Embodiment 6, N = 2 in the multilayer optical information recording medium of the<br>
present invention in Embodiment 5, in other words an example of an information recording<br>
medium constituted from biphasic information layers is explained. A partial cross-sectional<br>
diagram of information recording medium 32 of Embodiment 6 is shown in Fig. 6.<br>
Information recording medium 32 is a bilayer optical information recording medium<br>
wherein it is possible to record and/or reproduce information by means of irradiating with<br>
laser beam 11 from one side in substantially the same manner as for information recording<br>
medium 24 of Embodiment 3.<br>
[0131] Information recording medium 32 is constituted from first information layer 23 on<br>
substrate 26 and second information layer 25 on substrate 30 bonded together through<br>
adhesive layer 27.<br>
Depending on the requirements, a guide groove for guiding a laser beam can be formed<br>
on the surface of the second reflecting layer 308 side of substrate 30. It is preferable for the<br>
surfaces of substrate 30, which is the opposite side of second reflecting layer 308 side, to<br>
be smooth.<br>
[0132] In addition, where a component is identified by the same symbol as was used in<br>
Embodiment 3, Embodiment 4 and Embodiment 5, it will be omitted from the explanation.<br>
Information recording medium 32 can be manufactured by the method explained below.<br>
[0133] First information layer 23 is first formed over substrate 26 (of thickness 0.6 mm, for<br>
example) in substantially the same manner as in Embodiment 5.<br>
Furthermore, after adjustable transmittance layer 209 is formed, depending on the<br>
requirements, an initialization process can be carried out in which the entire first recording<br>
layer 204 is crystallized. The crystallization of first recording layer 204 can be carried out<br>
by irradiating with a laser beam.<br>
[0134] Additionally, second information layer 25 is formed over substrate 30 (of thickness 0.6<br>
mm, for example). At this time, if a guide groove for the purpose of guiding laser beam 11<br>
is to be formed on substrate 30, second reflective layer 25 is formed on the side where the<br>
guide groove is formed. Specifically, substrate 30 is positioned within a coating apparatus,<br>
and second reflective layer 308, second dielectric layer 306, second interface layer 305,<br>
second recording layer 304, first interface layer 303 and first dielectric layer 302 are<br>
laminated on sequentially. Moreover, depending on the requirements, an interface layer can<br>
be formed between second reflective layer 308 and second dielectric layer 306. The<br>
methods for forming the films of the various layers are substantially the same as in<br>
Embodiment 3.<br>
[01.35] Furthermore, after first dielectric layer 302 is formed, depending on the requirements, an<br>
initialization process can be carried out in which the entire second recording layer 304 is<br>
crystallized. The crystallization of second recording layer 304 can be carried out by<br><br>
irradiating with laser beam.<br>
[0136] Finally, substrate 26 laminated with first information layer 23 and substrate 30 laminated<br>
with second information layer 25 are bonded together through adhesive layer 27.<br>
Specifically, a resin such as a photocurable resin (particularly an ultraviolet radiation-<br>
curable resin) or a slow-acting resin is applied over first information layer 23 or second<br>
information layer 25, and after substrate 26 and substrate 30 have been bonded together and<br>
spin coated, the resin can be cured. Moreover, an adhesive resin can be uniformly applied<br>
over first information layer 23 or second information layer 25 beforehand, and substrate 26<br>
and substrate 30 can be bonded together.<br>
[0137] In addition, depending on the requirements, an initialization process can be carried out in<br>
which the entire second recording layer 304 and first recording layer 204 are crystallized.<br>
In this case, based on substantially the same reasoning as in Embodiment 3, it is preferable<br>
for second recording layer 304 to be crystallized first.<br>
[0138] Information recording medium 32 can be manufactured in the above manner. Furthermore,<br>
while each of the layers is formed by using the sputtering method in the present<br>
embodiment, the embodiment is not limited to this method and it is also possible to use a<br>
vacuum deposition method, an ion plating method, a CVD method, an MBE method and the<br>
like.<br>
[0139] In addition, the order of forming each layers are not limited to the above-mentioned<br>
order.	-<br>
(Embodiment 7)<br>
The recording and reproducing methods for the information recording media of the<br>
present invention explained in Embodiments 1 to 3 are explained in Embodiment 7.<br>
[0140] A portion of the constitution of recording and reproducing apparatus 38 used in the<br>
recording and reproducing methods of the present invention is shown schematically in Fig.<br>
7. Recording and reproducing apparatus 38 is provided with optical head 36 that is<br>
equipped with spindle motor 33 for rotating information recording apparatus 37,<br>
semiconductor laser 35 and objective lens 34 for focusing laser beam 11 that is output from<br>
semiconductor laser 35. Information recording medium 37 is the information recording<br>
medium explained in Embodiments 1 to 3, and is provided with single information layers<br>
(for example, information layer 16) or multiple information layers (for example, first<br>
information layer 23, second information layer 25). Objective lens 34 focuses laser beam<br>
11 on an information layer.<br>
[0141] The recording, erasing and overwriting of information on the information recording<br>
medium is carried out by modulating the power of laser beam 11, with a high power peak<br>
power (Pp (mW)) and a low power bias power (Pb (mW)). By irradiating with laser beam 11<br>
at peak power, an amorphous phase is formed in a localized portion of the recording layer,<br>
and this amorphous phase becomes the recording mark. Between recording marks,<br><br>
irradiation at the bias power of laser beam 11 forms a crystalline phase (erased portion).<br>
Furthermore, when laser beam 11 at peak power is irradiated, laser beam 11 generally<br>
forms a pulse sequence, which is referred to as a multipulse. Furthermore, the multipulse<br>
can be modulated only with power levels of the peak power and the bias power, or with<br>
power level within the range of 0 mW to the peak power.<br>
[0142] Additionally, at the power level lower than both the peak power and the bias power there<br>
will be no effect on the optical functioning of the recording mark due to irradiation with<br>
laser beam 11, while the power obtained as a sufficient amount of reflected light in order to<br>
reproduce the recording marks from the information recording medium is the reproducing<br>
power (Pr(mW)), and by reproducing the signal in a detector from the information<br>
recording medium obtained by irradiating with laser beam 11 at reproducing power,<br>
reproducing of the information signal can be performed.<br>
[0143] In order to adjust the laser beam spot diameter within the range of 0.4 um to 0.7 urn, the<br>
numerical aperture (NA) of objective lens 34 is preferably within the range of 0.5 to 1.1,<br>
more preferably within the range of 0.6 to 0.9. The wavelength of laser beam 11 is<br>
preferably 
crystallization not to occur readily using the reproducing light and to obtain sufficient<br>
erasure performance, the linear information recording speed for the information recording<br>
medium is preferably within the range of 1 m/sec to 20 m/sec (more preferably, within the<br>
range of 2 m/sec to 15 m/sec).	•<br>
[0144] For information recording media 24 and 32 that are provided with two information layers,<br>
the focal point of laser beam 11 contacts first recording layer 204 when recording onto first<br>
information layer 23, and information is recorded to first recording layer 204 with laser<br>
beam 11 passing through transparent layer 13. Reproducing from first recording layer 204<br>
is carried out by using laser beam 11 that is reflected by first recording layer 204 and<br>
passes through transparent layer 13. When recording to second information layer 25, the<br>
focal point of laser beam 11 contacts second recording layer 304, and information is<br>
recorded to second information layer 25 with laser beam 11 passing through transparent<br>
layer 13, first information layer 23, and optical separation layer 17. Reproducing from<br>
second recording layer 25 is carried out by using laser beam 11 that is reflected by second<br>
recording layer 304 and passes through optical separation layer 17, first information layer<br>
23 and transparent layer 13.<br>
[0145] Furthermore, when a guide groove for guiding laser beam 11 is formed in substrate 14, or<br>
optical separation layers 20, 19 or 17, information can be recorded on the side of the<br>
surface groove proximal to the laser beam 11 incident side (groove) or on the distal side of<br>
the surface groove (land). Additionally, information can be recorded on both the groove and<br>
the land.<br>
[0146] For the recording capability, the power of laser beam 11 is modulated between 0 to Pp<br><br>
/	(mW), and by the (1-7) modulation method, random signals from a mark length of 0.149<br>
um (2T) to 0.596 um (8T) are recorded, and recording mark front end and tail end jitter<br>
(mark position error) can be evaluated by measuring with a time interval analyzer. Here,<br>
the smaller the jitter value, the better recording performance. Moreover, Pp and Pb<br>
determined the minimization of the average values for the front end and tail end jitter<br>
(average jitter). This gives the Pp most suitable for recording sensitivity.<br>
[0147] Furthermore, the repeat overwrite cycle number was evaluated, with the power of laser<br>
beam 11 modulated between 0 and Pp (mW), random signals for mark lengths from 0.149<br>
um (2T) to 0.596 um (8T) were recorded continuously, and in each recorded overwrite<br>
cycle the front end and tail end jitter were measured with a time interval analyzer. The<br>
upper limiting value for the repeat overwriting cycle number was a 3% increase with<br>
respect to the front end and tail end average jitter values over one cycle. Here, the Pp and Pb<br>
determined how the average jitter values were minimized.<br>
[0148] In addition, the signal storage stability was evaluated, with the power of laser beam 11<br>
modulated between 0 and Pp (mW), random signals for mark lengths from 0.149 u-m (2T) to<br>
0.596 um (8T) were recorded on the grooves, carried out an accelerated test under an 20%<br>
PvH environment at 80 °C for 100 h, and the amount of jitter change ((jitters after the<br>
acceleration) - (jitters before the acceleration)) after the test was evaluated. Here, Pp and Pb<br>
are determined so as to minimize average jitter values, and each of marks recorded for 10,<br>
100 and 1000 times were evaluated.<br>
(Embodiment 8)<br>
The recording and reproducing methods for the information recording media of the<br>
present invention explained in Embodiments 4 to 6 are explained in Embodiment 8.<br>
[0149] A portion of the constitution of recording and reproducing apparatus 38 used in the<br>
recording and reproducing methods of the present invention is the same as Embodiment 7<br>
and is shown schematically in Fig. 7. Here, where there are the same explanations appeared<br>
in Embodiment 7, they will be omitted. Information recording medium 37 is the<br>
information recording medium explained in Embodiments 4 to 6, and is provided with<br>
single information layers (for example, information layer 16) or multiple information layers<br>
(for example, first information layer 23, second information layer 25).<br>
[0150] In order to adjust the laser beam spot diameter within the range of 0.4 um to 0.7 um, the<br>
numerical aperture (NA) of objective lens 34 is preferably within the range of 0.5 to 1.1,<br>
more preferably within the range of 0.6 to 0.9. The wavelength of laser beam 11 is<br>
preferably 
crystallization not to occur readily using the reproducing light and to obtain sufficient<br>
erasure performance, the linear information recording speed for the information recording<br>
medium is preferably within the range of 1 m/sec to 20 m/sec (more preferably, within the<br>
range of 2 m/sec to 15 m/sec).<br><br>
[0151] Furthermore, when a guide groove for guiding laser beam 11 is formed in substrate 14, or<br>
optical separation layers 20, 19 or 17, information can be recorded on the side of the<br>
surface groove proximal to the laser beam 11 incident side (groove) or on the distal side of<br>
the surface groove (land). Additionally, information can be recorded on both the groove and<br>
the land.<br>
[0152] For the recording capability, the power of laser beam 11 is modulated between 0 to Pp<br>
(mW), random signals from a mark length of 0.40 urn (3T) to 1.47 um (1 IT) are recorded,<br>
and recording mark front end and tail end jitter (mark position error) can be evaluated by<br>
measuring with a time interval analyzer. Here, the smaller the jitter value, the better<br>
recording performance. Moreover, Pp and Pb determined the minimization of the average<br>
values for the front end and tail end jitter (average jitter). This gives the Pp most suitable<br>
for recording sensitivity.<br>
[0153] Furthermore, the repeat overwrite cycle number was evaluated, with the power of laser<br>
beam 11 modulated between 0 and Pp (mW), random signals for mark lengths from 0.40 um<br>
(3T) to 1.47 urn (11T) were recorded continuously, and in each recorded overwrite cycle<br>
the front end and tail end jitter were measured with a time interval analyzer. The upper<br>
limiting value for the repeat overwriting cycle number was a 3% increase with respect to<br>
the front end and tail end average jitter values over one cycle. Here, the Pp and Pb<br>
determined such that the average jitter values were minimized.<br>
The signal storage stability was evaluated, with the power of laser beam 11 modulated<br>
between 0 and Pp (mW), random signals for mark lengths from 0.149 um (2T) to 0.596 um<br>
(8T) were recorded on the groove, carried out an accelerated test under an 20% RH<br>
environment at 80 °C for 100 h, and the amount of jitter deterioration (the amount of<br>
archival deterioration) after the test was evaluated. Here, Pp and Pb are determined so as to<br>
minimize average jitter values, and each of marks recorded for 10, 100 and 1000 times<br>
were evaluated.<br>
(Embodiment 9)<br>
An example of an information recording medium of the present invention is explained in<br>
Embodiment 9. One example of a configuration for an electrical information recording<br>
medium 44 of Embodiment 9 is shown in Fig. 8. Electrical information recording medium<br>
44 is an information recording medium wherein it is possible to record and/or reproduce<br>
information by means of applying electrical energy, particularly an electric current.<br>
[0154] A resin substrate such as of polycarbonate and the like, a glass substrate, a ceramic<br>
substrate such as of AI2O3 and the like, various semiconductor substrates such as of Si, and<br>
various metal substrates such as of Cu can be used for substrate 39. The case of an Si<br>
substrate will be explained here. Electrical information recording medium 44 is formed by<br>
sequential lamination of lower electrode 40, first interface layer 401, first recording layer<br>
41, second interface layer 402, third interface layer 403, second recording layer 42, fourth<br><br>
interface layer 404 and upper electrode 43. Lower electrode 40 and upper electrode 43 are<br>
formed in order to apply an electric current to first recording layer 41 and second recording<br>
layer 42. Here, first interface layer 401 and second interface layer 402 are established to<br>
adjust the amount of crystallization time of first recording layer 41, and third interface<br>
layer 403 and fourth interface layer 404 are established to adjust the amount of<br>
crystallization time of second recording layer 42.<br>
[0155] Substantially the same materials as were used for first interface layer 103 in Embodiment<br>
1 can be used in first interface layer 401, second interface layer 402, third interface layer<br>
r4303, forth interface layer 404.<br>
Materials that undergo a reversible phase-change between the crystalline phase and the<br>
amorphous phase by means of Joule heating generated by the application of electrical<br>
current are used in first recording layer 41 and second recording layer 42, where the<br>
phenomenon of a change in electrical resistance between the crystalline phase and the<br>
amorphous phase is utilized to record information. The material used for first recording<br>
layer 41 can be substantially the same as that of first recording layer 204 of Embodiment 2,<br>
and the material used for second recording layer 42 can be substantially the same as that of<br>
second recording layer 304 of Embodiment 3.<br>
[0156] First recording layer 41 and second recording layer 42 can be formed in substantially the<br>
same manner as first recording layer 204 of Embodiment 2 and second recording layer 304<br>
of Embodiment 3, respectively.<br>
In addition, simple metal materials such as Al, Au, Ag, Cu and Pt can be used for lower<br>
electrode 40 and upper electrode 43, as well as alloy materials that have one or a plurality<br>
of elements from among these as the chief components to which have been added one or a<br>
plurality of other elements that are suitable for increasing the moisture resistance as well as<br>
regulating the thermal conductivity and the like. Lower electrode 40 and upper electrode 43<br>
can be formed under an Ar gas atmosphere by sputtering from a material that is a base<br>
metal or a base alloy. Here, the method used for forming the various layers can be a<br>
vacuum deposition method, an ion plating method, a CVD method, an MBE method and the<br>
like.<br>
[0157] Electrical information recording medium 44 is electrically connected to electrical<br>
information recording and reproducing apparatus 50 through application unit 45. This<br>
electrical information recording and reproducing apparatus 50 is connected to pulse power<br>
source 48 by means of switch 47 in order to apply an electrical current pulse between lower<br>
electrode 40 and upper electrode 43 to first recording layer 41 and second recording layer<br>
42. Additionally, in order to detect the resistance value due to the phase-changes in first<br>
recording layer 41 and second recording layer 42, resistance meter 46 is connected via<br>
switch 49 between lower electrode 40 and upper electrode 43. In order to change first<br>
recording layer 41 and second recording layer 42 from the amorphous phase (high<br><br>
resistance state) to the crystalline phase (low resistance state), switch 47 is closed (switch<br>
49 is opened) to apply an electrical current pulse between the electrodes, and the<br>
temperature of the portion receiving the electrical current pulse will be higher than the<br>
crystallization temperature of the material and lower than the melting point, so that the<br>
crystallization time interval can be maintained. On returning from the crystalline phase to<br>
become amorphous again, an electrical current pulse that is relatively higher than during<br>
crystallization is applied for a shorter time, the temperature of the recording layer rises<br>
higher than the melting point and melts, after which it quickly cools. Furthermore, pulse<br>
power source 48 for electrical information recording and reproducing apparatus 50 can<br>
output the recording/erasing pulse waveforms shown in Fig. 11.<br>
[0158] Here, the resistance value when first recording layer 41 is in the amorphous phase is rai,<br>
the resistance value when first recording layer 41 is in the crystalline phase is rci, the<br>
resistance value when second recording layer 42 is in the amorphous phase is ra2, and the<br>
resistance value when second recording layer 42 is in the crystalline phase is rc2. Here, with<br>
rci 
different values can be determined for the sums of the resistance values for first recording<br>
layer 41 and second recording layer 42, rai+r.a2, r^+Xgj. ra?+r^i and rci+rc2. Consequently, by<br>
measuring the resistance value for the electrode gap with resistance meter 46, four different<br>
statuses and thus two information values can be detected at one time.<br>
[0159] As shown in Fig. 9, a high capacity electrical information recording medium 51 that is<br>
constituted from a plural arrangement of these electrical information recording media 44 in<br>
a matrix. In each memory cell 54, a configuration substantially the same as electrical<br>
information recording medium 44 is formed in a microscopic region. Information recording<br>
and reproducing operations can be carried out in the various memory cells 54 by<br>
designating one of them by the respective word line 52 and pit line 53.<br>
[0160] Electrical information recording medium 51 is used in Fig. 10, which shows a<br>
configuration example of an information recording system. Storage apparatus 56 is<br>
constituted from electrical information recording medium 51 and address indicator circuit<br>
55. By means of address indicator circuit 55, word line 52 and pit line 53 of electrical<br>
information recording medium 51 are indicated respectively, and information recording and<br>
reproducing operations can be carried out in each of the memory cells 54. Moreover, by<br>
means of an electrical connection from storage apparatus 56 to external circuit 57 that is<br>
constituted by at least pulse power source 58 and resistance meter 59, information<br>
recording and reproducing operations can be carried out to electrical information recording<br>
medium 51.<br>
[0161] [Examples]<br>
Specific modes to implement the present invention are explained in detail by using<br>
examples.<br><br>
(Example 1)<br>
In Example 1, information recording medium 15 of Fig. 1 was constructed and was<br>
examined with respect to the materials of first interface layer 103 and second interface<br>
layer 105, the recording sensitivity, the repeat overwriting capability, and signal storage<br>
stability of information layer 16. Specifically, information recording media 15 that includes<br>
information layers 16 with different materials for first interface layer 103 and second<br>
interface layer 105 were constructed, and the recording sensitivity, the repeat overwriting<br>
capability, and signal storage stability of information layers 16 were measured.<br>
[0162] The samples were manufactured as described below. First, for substrate 14, polycarbonate<br>
substrates (diameter 120 mm, thickness 1.1 mm) were prepared and a guide groove (depth<br>
20 nm, track pitch 0.32 um) was formed for guiding laser beam 11. Next, the following<br>
were laminated on this polycarbonate substrate by the sequential sputtering method: an Ag-<br>
Pd-Cu layer (thickness: 80 nm) as reflective layer 108, a Dy2C&gt;3 layer (thickness: 15 nm),<br>
second interface layer 105 (thickness: 5 nm), a Ge28Sn3Bi2Te34 layer (thickness: 11 nm) as<br>
recording layer 104, second interface layer 103 (thickness: 5 nm), and a (ZnS)go(SiO2)2o<br>
layer (thickness: 58 nm) as first dielectric layer 102.<br>
[0163] Finally, an ultraviolet radiation-curable resin was applied over first dielectric layer 102,<br>
and after a uniform resin layer was formed by bonding polycarbonate (diameter 120 mm,<br>
thickness 90 urn) to first dielectric layer 102 and rotating, a 100 um thick transparent layer<br>
13 was formed by curing the resin with ultraviolet radiation. Later, an initialization process<br>
was carried out in which recording layer 104 was crystallized with a laser beam. As<br>
mentioned above, a plurality of information recording media of different materials for first<br>
interface layer 103 and second interface layer 105 were manufactured.<br>
[0164] With the samples obtained in this manner, the recording sensitivity of information layer<br>
16 of information recording medium 15 and the repeat overwriting capability were tested<br>
using the recording and reproducing apparatus 38 in Fig. 7. In this case, the wavelength of<br>
laser beam 11 was 405 nm, numerical aperture (NA) of objective lens 34 was 0.85, the<br>
sample linear speeds during measurement were 4.9 m/sec and 9.8 m/sec, and the shortest<br>
mark length (2T) was 0.149 um. Additionally, the information was recorded on the groove.<br>
An accelerated test for the evaluation of the signal storage stability was carried out in a<br>
thermostatic chamber under a humidity of 20% RH environment at 80 °C for 100 h.<br>
[0165] Results are shown for the evaluation of materials of first interface layer 103 and second<br>
interface layer 105 of information layer 16 of information recording medium 15, and the<br>
recording sensitivity and the repeat overwriting capability of information layer 16, in Table<br>
1 for the linear speed of 4.9 m/sec (IX), in Table 2 for the linear speed of 9.8 m/sec (2X)<br>
and in Table 3 for the signal storage stability. Here, Zr-In-0 in the Tables represent<br>
(Zr02)5o(In203)5o, Zr-Cr-0 represent (Zr02)5o(Cr203)5o, respectively. Here, for the<br>
recording sensitivity at IX, 6.0 mW and 
 <br>
indicated by A, and &gt;7.0 mW is indicated by X. Moreover, for the recording sensitivity at<br>
2X, 6.5 mW and 7.5 mW is<br>

Particularly, when (Zr02)5o(Cr203)5o was used for an interface layer (first interface layer<br>
103, 303 and third interface layer 203) which is closer to the laser incident side than a<br>
recording layer, and (Zr02)5o(In203)5o was used for an interface layer (second interface<br>

[0224] Here, as one example, in Example 1, the recording sensitivity, the repeat overwriting<br>

second interface layer 105. Results are shown in Table 19 for IX, in Table 20 for 2X and in<br>
Table 21 for the signal storage stability.<br><br><br><br>
[0228] (Example 11)<br>
In Example 1 to 10, the same experiments were performed when an Cr-containing layer<br>

[0232] (Example 12)<br>
In Example 12, electrical information recording medium 44 of Fig. 8 was manufactured,<br>
and the phase-change due to application of an electrical current was observed.<br>
[0233] A silicon substrate with a nitride-treated surface was prepared as substrate 39, on which<br>
was laminated by the sequential sputtering method: Pt (surface area: 6 urn x 6 um;<br>
thickness: 0.1 um), used for lower electrode 40; (ZrO2)25(SiO2)25(Cr2O3)50 (surface area: 4.5<br>
um x 5 um; thickness: 0.01 um), used for first interface layer 401; Ge22Bi2Te25 (surface<br>
area: 5 um x 5 um; thickness: 0.1 um), used for first recording layer 41;<br><br>
(ZrO2)25(SiO2)25(In2O3)50 (surface area: 4.5 (a.m x 5 um; thickness: 0.01 am), used for<br>
second interface layer 402; (ZrCh^SiCh^CrsC^so (surface area: 4.5 urn x 5 um;<br>
thickness: 0.01 um), used for third interface layer 403; Sb7oTe2sGe5 (surface area: 5 um x 5<br>
um; thickness: 0.1 um), used for second recording layer 42; (ZrO2)25(SiO2)25(Cr2O3)50<br>
(surface area: 4.5 urn x 5 um; thickness: 0.01 um), used for fourth interface layer 404; and,<br>
Pt (surface area: 5 um x 5 um; thickness: 0.1 um), used for upper electrode 43. First<br>
interface layer 401, second interface layer 402, third interface layer 403 and, fourth<br>
interface layer 404 were insulators. Consequently, in order for electric current to flow in<br>
first recording layer 41 and second recording layer 42, the films of first interface layer 401,<br>
second interface layer 402, third interface layer 403 and, fourth interface layer 404 had to<br>
be formed with a smaller surface area than that of first recording layer 41 and second<br>
recording layer 42, and these interface layers contacted with lower electrode 40, first<br>
recording layer 41, second recording layer 42 and upper electrode 43, respectively.<br>
[0234] Then, lower electrode 40 and upper electrode 43 were bonded to Au lead lines, and<br>
electrical information recording medium 44 was connected to electrical information<br>
recording and reproducing apparatus 50 through application unit 45. From this electrical<br>
information recording and reproducing apparatus 50, pulse electrical source 48 was<br>
connected between lower electrode 40 and upper electrode 43 by means of switch 47, and<br>
furthermore the changes in resistance value due to the phase-changes in first recording<br>
layer 41 and second recording layer 42 could be detected by means of resistance meter 46<br>
connected via switch 49 between lower electrode 40 and upper electrode 43.<br>
[0235] Here, the melting point Tmi of first recording layer 41 was 630 °C, the crystallization<br>
temperature Txi was 170 °C and the crystallization time txl was 100 ns. In addition, the<br>
melting point Tm2 of second recording layer 42 was 550 °C, the crystallization temperature<br>
TX2 was 200 °C and the crystallization time tx2 was 50 ns. Moreover, the resistance rai of the<br>
amorphous phase from first recording layer 41 was 500 Q., the resistance rci for the<br>
crystalline phase was 10 Q, resistance ra2 of the amorphous phase from second recording<br>
layer 42 was 500 Q., and the resistance rC2 for the crystalline phase was 20 Q..<br>
[0236] If first recording layer 41 and second recording layer 42 are both in the amorphous phase<br>
(status 1), and electrical current pulse of Ici = 5 mA, tci = 150 ns in the waveform 501<br>
shown in Fig. 11 was applied between lower electrode 40 and upper electrode 43, only first<br>
recording layer 41 would undergo the transition from amorphous to crystalline (referred to<br>
below as Status 2). Additionally, in Status 1, when an electrical current pulse of Ic2 = 10<br>
mA and tc2 = 100 ns in recording waveform 502 shown in Fig. 11 was applied between<br>
lower electrode 40 and upper electrode 43, only second recording layer 42 would undergo<br>
the transition from amorphous to crystalline (referred to below as Status 3). Additionally, in<br>
Status 1, when an electrical current pulse of IC2 = 10 mA and tci = 150 ns in recording<br>
waveform 503 shown in Fig. 11 was applied between lower electrode 40 and upper<br><br>
electrode 43, both first recording layer 41 and second recording layer 42 would undergo the<br>
transition from amorphous to crystalline (referred to below as Status 4).<br>
[0237] Next, in the low resistance state (Status 4) where both first recording layer 41 and second<br>
recording layer 42 were in the crystalline phase, when an electrical current pulse of Iai = 20<br>
mA, IC2 = 10 mA and tC2 = 100 ns was applied between lower electrode 40 and upper<br>
electrode 43, only first recording layer 41 would undergo the transition from crystalline to<br>
amorphous (Status 3). Moreover, in Status 4, when an electrical current pulse of Ia2 = 15<br>
mA and ta2 = 50 ns in recording waveform 505 shown in Fig. 11 was applied between lower<br>
electrode 40 and upper electrode 43, only second recording layer 42 would undergo the<br>
transition from crystalline to amorphous (Status 2). Additionally, in Status 4, when an<br>
electrical current pulse of Iai = 20 mA, tai = 50 ns in erasing waveform 506 shown in Fig.<br>
11 was applied between lower electrode 40 and upper electrode 43, both first recording<br>
layer 41 and second recording layer 42 would undergo the transition from crystalline to<br>
amorphous (Status 1).<br>
[0238] Furthermore, in either Status 2 or Status 3, when an electrical current pulse of Io2 =10 mA<br>
and tci = 150 ns in recording waveform 503 shown in Fig. 11 was applied, both first<br>
recording layer 41 and second recording layer 42 would undergo the transition from<br>
amorphous to crystalline (Status 4). In addition, in either Status 2 or Status 3, when an<br>
electrical current pulse of Iai = 20 mA, IC2 = 10 mA, tcl = 150 ns and tai =50 ns in erasing<br>
waveform 507 shown in Fig. 11 was applied, both first recording layer 41 and second<br>
recording layer 42 would undergo the transition from crystalline to amorphous (Status 1).<br>
Moreover, in Status 2, when an electrical current pulse of Iai = 20 mA, IC2 = 10 mA, tc2 =<br>
100 ns and tai = 50 ns in recording waveform 508 shown in Fig. 11 was applied, first<br>
recording layer 41 would undergo a transition from crystalline to amorphous and second<br>
recording layer 42 would undergo a transition from amorphous to crystalline (Status 3). In<br>
addition, in Status 3, when an electrical current pulse of Ia2 = 15 mA, Ici = 5 mA, tci = 150<br>
ns and ta2 =50 ns in recording waveform 509 shown in Fig. 11 was applied, first recording<br>
layer 41 would undergo a transition from amorphous to crystalline and second recording<br>
layer 42 would undergo a transition from crystalline to amorphous (Status 2).<br>
[0239] From the above results, in electrical phase-change information recording medium 44 of<br>
Fig. 8, first recording layer 41 and second recording layer 42 undergo electrical, reversible<br>
changes between the respective crystalline and amorphous phases, and it is known to be<br>
possible to realize four types of status (Status 1: first recording layer 41 and second<br>
recording layer 42 are both in the amorphous phase; Status 2: first recording layer 41 is in<br>
the crystalline phase and second recording layer 42 is in the amorphous phase; Status 3:<br>
first recording layer 41 is in the amorphous phase and second recording layer 42 is in the<br>
crystalline phase; Status 4: first recording layer 41 and second recording layer 42 are both<br>
in the crystalline phase).<br><br>
y<br>
[0240] Additionally, when the repeat overwrite capability electrical phase-change information<br>
recording medium 44 of is measured, with first interface layer 401, second interface layer<br>
402, third interface layer 403 and fourth interface layer 404, it is known that there can be<br>
an approximately &gt;10-fold increase compared to the case where the dielectric layers are<br>
absent. This is because first interface layer 401, second interface layer 402, third interface<br>
layer 403 and fourth interface layer 404 act to suppress mass transfer from lower electrode<br>
40 and from upper electrode 43 to first recording layer 41 and to second recording layer 42.<br>
[0241] According to the present invention, regardless of the number of information layers, an<br>
optical information recording medium with improved transmittance and signal strength of<br>
the information layers can be offered .<br>
Embodiments of the present invention are described with the examples, however, the<br>
present invention is not limited to the above mentioned Embodiments and can be applied to<br>
other Embodiments based on the technical ideas of the present invention<br>

improved, the media possess qualities for the long-term storage of data (non-volatile), and<br>
are useful for high-density overwritable-type or one write-type optical disks and the like.<br>
