				<td>AUXILIARY STORAGE SYSTEM FOR REFRIGERATOR<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a refrigerator, and more particularly, to an<br>
auxiliary storage system which is installed in a storage space and of which<br>
temperature can be controlled separately from the storage space.<br>
Background Art<br>
In general, a side-by-side refrigerator has a relatively large storage<br>
capacity and provides various and multiplex functions. Further, the refrigerator<br>
includes refrigerating and freezing chambers that are installed side by side with<br>
respect to each other.<br>
. A storage compartment of which temperature can be individually<br>
controlled is additionally installed within the refrigerating or freezing chamber of<br>
the refrigerator so that specific stored goods therein can be stored for a long time.<br>
To this end, the temperature in the storage compartment is set to be different from<br>
that of the refrigerating or freezing chamber.<br>
A refrigerator in which such a storage compartment is installed is<br>
disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,170,276. However, the refrigerator disclosed in<br>
the ' 276 patent has the following problems.<br>
That is, there is a problem. in that the goods stored in the storage<br>
compartment are influenced by the temperature of the refrigerating or freezing<br>
chamber in which the storage compartment is installed, since thermal insulation<br>
between the storage compartment and the exterior thereof is not sufficiently<br>
performed.<br>
Further, in order to maintain freshness of the goods stored in the storage<br>
compartment, the stored goods are subjected to indirect cooling. According to<br>
the refrigerator disclosed in the above patent, a cold air supply port for supplying<br>
cold air from the freezing chamber to the vicinity of the storage compartment and<br>
a cold air discharge port for discharging the cold air from the vicinity of the<br><br>
storage compartment to the freezing chamber are formed to be adjacent to each other. Therefore,<br>
there is another problem in that the cold air cannot be transferred uniformly throughout the storage<br>
compartment.<br>
In addition, there is a further problem in that the refrigerating chamber may be excessively<br>
cooled if the cold air, which is supplied from the freezing chamber to the vicinity of the storage<br>
compartment installed within the refrigerating chamber so as to maintain the temperature in the<br>
storage compartment, leaks out to the refrigerating chamber.<br>

Best Mode of Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Hereinafter, a preferred embodiment of an auxiliary storage system for a refrigerator<br>
according to the present invention will be explained in detail with reference to the accompanying<br>
drawings.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1 shown in a state where a door is removed from a<br>
refrigerator, a freezing chamber 12 and a refrigerating chamber 13, which are storage<br>
spaces, are formed side by side within a main body 10 of the refrigerator. The main<br>
body of the refrigerator is partitioned from side to side into the freezing<br><br>
chamber 12 and the refrigerating chamber 13 by a barrier 15 (refer to FIG. 3).<br>
Each of the freezing and refrigerating chambers 12, 13 is partitioned into a<br>
plurality of spaces for storing goods by shelves 30 and the like. A plurality of<br>
auxiliary, storage compartments 50 are installed within one of the spaces located at<br>
a lower end side.of the refrigerating chamber 13. Although the auxiliary storage<br>
compartments 50 are installed within the refrigerating chamber 13, they are not<br>
influenced by internal environments of the refrigerating chamber 13,<br>
FIG. 2 shows the internal constitution of an auxiliary storage system<br>
according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention. As shown in the<br>
figure, a cold air supply port 17 and a cold air discharge port 18 are bored through<br>
the barrier 15 by which the freezing and refrigerating chambers 12, 13 are<br>
separated.from each other. Cold air in the freezing chamber 12 is supplied<br>
through the cold air supply port 17 to the auxiliary storage system installed within<br>
the refrigerating chamber 13, and then, the cold air which has passed through the<br>
auxiliary storage system is discharged back through the cold air discharge port 18<br>
into the freezing chamber 12.<br>
An insulating body 20 is installed within the refrigerating chamber 13 and<br>
is formed of an insulation material not to be influenced by the internal<br>
environments of the refrigerating chamber 13. The insulating body 20 takes an<br>
exterior shape corresponding to an interior shape of the refrigerating chamber 13.<br>
In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the insulating body takes a<br>
hexahedral shape with' open top and front faces thereof. Of course, the insulating<br>
body 20 may be formed such that only the front face thereof is opened. The<br>
insulating body 20 includes a cold air inlet and a cold air outlet that are formed to<br>
communicate with the cold air supply port 17 and the cold air discharge port 18,<br>
respectively.<br>
A blower fan unit 25 is further installed within the insulating body 20.<br>
The blower fan unit 25 provides driving force which allows the cold air in the<br>
freezing chamber 12 to be drawn into the insulating body 20 through the cold, air<br>
supply port 17 so as to flow therein.<br>
A top portion of the insulating body 20 is shielded by one of the shelves<br><br>
30. The shelf 30 allows the top portion of the insulating body 20 to be shielded<br>
and the stored goods to be placed thereon. The shelf is made of glass material.<br>
A cell cover 32 may be installed between the shelf 30 and the top portion of the<br>
insulating body 20. The cell cover 32 can hold moisture-therein to keep the<br>
insulating body 20 at an appropriate humidity.<br>
Furthermore, a heat transfer tray 40 is also installed within the insulating<br>
body 20. It is preferred that the heat transfer tray 40 be made of material having<br>
a high heat transfer rate or coefficient. Thus, aluminum is employed in the<br>
preferred embodiment of the present invention. Like the insulating body 20, the<br>
heat transfer tray 40,.is formed to take a hexahedral shape with open-top and front<br>
faces thereof.<br>
Between an outer surface of the heat transfer tray 40 and an inner surface<br>
of the insulating body 20 is formed a cold air flow passage 42 through which the<br>
cold air introduced by the blower fan unit 25 flows. The cold air flow passage<br>
42 is formed by making some portions of the insulating body 20 protrude from the<br>
rest of the insulating body such that the portions of the insulating body can<br>
support the outer surface of the heat transfer tray 40 thereon. For example, the<br>
protruding portions of the insulating body 20 support four.lower corner portions<br>
of the heat transfer tray 40 thereon, so that the cold air flow passage- 42 can be<br>
formed between the outer surface of the heat transfer tray 40 and the inner surface<br>
of the insulating body 20.<br>
Within a forwardly opened space defined by theheat transfer tray 40 and<br>
the cell cover 32 is installed a drawer type auxiliary storage compartment 50<br>
which can be pushed into and pulled out from the space. The auxiliary storage<br>
compartment 50 is formed to comprise a bottom side 50a, two lateral sides 50b<br>
and a rear side 50c which come into direct contact with a bottom side 40a, two<br>
lateral sides 40b and a rear side 40c of the heat transfer tray 40, respectively.<br>
Therefore, the auxiliary storage compartment 50 according to the preferred<br>
embodiment of the present invention takes an upwardly opened hexahedral shape.<br>
A door 52 of the auxiliary storage compartment. 50 defines a front face of<br>
the auxiliary storage compartment 50. As shown in FIG. 1, the door 52 is<br><br>
exposed toward the front of the refrigerator when the door of the refrigerator is<br>
opened. Within the auxiliary storage compartment 50 is formed an upwardly<br>
opened storage section 53 which is defined by the bottom side 50a, the two lateral<br>
sides 50b, the rear side 50c and the door 52 of the storage compartment. A top<br>
portion of the. storage section 53 is shielded by the cell cover 32 when the<br>
auxiliary storage compartment 50 is received into the heat transfer tray 40.<br>
A temperature sensor 55 for sensing the temperature in the storage section<br>
53 is installed on an inner surface of the rear side 50c of the auxiliary storage<br>
compartment 50. The temperature sensor 55 transmits information on the sensed<br>
temperature to a microcomputer (not shown) of the refrigerator, which serves as a<br>
temperature control means. In the microcomputer, the temperature sensed by the<br>
temperature sensor 55 is compared with the temperature which a user has set for<br>
the auxiliary storage compartment 50, and driving of the blower fan unit 25 is<br>
accordingly controlled.<br>
Next, a structure used for mounting the insulating body 20 into the<br>
refrigerating chamber 13 will be explained with reference to FIGS. 3 and 4.<br>
Herein, the insulating body 20 is shown in these figures as being opened only at a<br>
front face thereof.<br>
The insulating body 20 is formed separately from and mounted into the<br>
main body 10 of the refrigerator. To this end, each of the cold air supply port 17<br>
and the cold air discharge port 18, which are formed in the barrier 15, is formed to<br>
protrude toward the refrigerating chamber 13. Further, fixing rings 60 are<br>
installed to wrap around the protruding portions of the cold air supply port 17 and<br>
cold air discharge port 18, respectively. Each, of the fixing rings. 60 is made of<br>
elastic material such as rubber and takes a hollow conical shape. The fixing<br>
rings 60 are constructed to wrap around the protruding portions of the ports 17,18<br>
up to tip ends thereof.<br>
In addition, an elastic support 62 shown in FIG. 5 is installed at a<br>
predetermined corner of the refrigerating chamber 13 in which the insulating body<br>
20 is received. The elastic support 62 is installed at the comer of the<br>
refrigerating chamber 13 which is located on the side opposite to the ports 17, 18.<br><br>
The elastic support 62 is also made of elastic material such as rubber. The elastic<br>
support 62 is used to fill a gap defined between the outer surface of the insulating<br>
body 20 and the inner surface of the refrigerating chamber 13, and has such a<br>
thickness that the insulating body 20 can be in close contact with the refrigerating<br>
chamber 13. A Seating groove 63 in which the corner of the insulating body 20<br>
is securely seated extends vertically along the elastic support 62.<br>
The elastic support 62 is mounted on the corner of the refrigerating<br>
chamber 13. For example, in FIG. 5, it is installed at a lowermost end of the<br>
refrigerating chamber 13. That is, since a machine room is disposed at the<br>
lowermost rear portion of the refrigerating chamber 13, the rear portion of the<br>
refrigerating chamber corresponding to the machine room protrudes toward the<br>
front of the refrigerator. The elastic support 62.includes a curved portion 64<br>
corresponding to the protruded portion of the refrigerating chamber 13.<br>
Furthermore, in order to bring the. insulating body 20- into close contact<br>
with the fixing rings 60, each of the cold air inlet and outlet 20i, 20e through<br>
which the cold air can flow into and from the insulating body 20, respectively,<br>
includes a contact surface 21 having a shape corresponding, to a tip; end of the<br>
fixing ring 60. The contact surface 21 is an inclined surface which is shaped to<br>
correspond to the shape of the tip end of the fixing ring 60, and it is formed '<br>
around an entrance of the cold air inlet 20i and an exit of the cold air outlet 20e.<br>
Hereinafter, an operation of the auxiliary storage system for the<br>
refrigerator according to the present invention constructed as such will be<br>
explained.<br>
A process of utilizing the auxiliary storage compartment 50 according to<br>
the preferred embodiment of the present invention will be explained with<br>
reference to FIG. 7. First, the user presses down a 'set temperature' button<br>
installed onto an operating panel (not shown) and inputs a desired temperature<br>
value. For example, in case of vegetable, the desired temperature value is set as<br>
0°C; while in case of meat such as beef, the desired temperature value is set as -<br>
7°C (step 100). The. inputted temperature value is transmitted to the<br>
microcomputer, and the information on the temperature sensed by the temperature<br><br>
sensor 55 is also transmitted to the microcomputer.<br>
The microcomputer compares the temperature in the auxiliary storage<br>
compartment 50 with the desired temperature set by the user (step 102). Then, if<br>
the temperature in the auxiliary storage compartment 50 is higher than the set<br>
temperature, the microcomputer causes the blower fan unit 25 to be driven (step<br>
104). On the contrary, if the temperature in the auxiliary storage compartment<br>
50 is lower than the set temperature, the process of receiving the temperature<br>
information from the temperature sensor 55 and comparing the two temperatures<br>
with each other will be continuously repeated.<br>
When the blower fan unit 25 is driven, the cold air in the freezing<br>
chamber 12 is introduced into the insulating body 20 of the refrigerating chamber<br>
13 through the cold air supply port 17. Then, the cold air is transferred into the<br>
cold air flow passage 42 defined between the heat transfer tray 40 and the<br>
insulating body 20 by means of the blower fan unit 25.<br>
Accordingly, heat exchange with the cold air occurs on the outer surface<br>
of the heat transfer tray 40, and the temperature -of the auxiliary storage<br>
compartment. 50 installed within the heat transfer, tray 40 starts to decrease.<br>
gradually. That is, heat in the auxiliary storage compartment 50 is transferred to<br>
the cold air in the cold air flow passage 42 via the heat transfer tray 40. The cold<br>
air which has flowed through the cold air flow passage 42 is returned to the<br>
freezing chamber 12 through the cold air discharge port 18.<br>
In the meantime, the information on the temperature sensed by the<br>
temperature sensor 55 is continuously transmitted to the microcomputer in which<br>
the set temperature is in turn compared with the temperature in the auxiliary<br>
storage compartment 50 (step 106). Then, if the temperature in the auxiliary<br>
storage compartment 50 reaches the set temperature, the blower fan unit 25 is<br>
turned off (step 108). If it is determined from the comparison result in step 106<br>
that the temperature in the auxiliary storage compartment 50 has not yet reached<br>
the set temperature, the blower fan unit is continuously driven (step 104).<br>
Furthermore, even though the driving of the blower fan unit 25 is stopped,<br>
the temperature sensor 55 continues to sense the temperature in the auxiliary<br><br>
storage compartment 50. The information on the temperature sensed by the<br>
temperature sensor is transmitted to the microcomputer and the sensed<br>
temperature is then compared with the set temperature so that it can be determined<br>
whether the blower fan unit 25 is driven or not.<br>
Next, a process of mounting the insulating body 20 into the refrigerating<br>
chamber 13 will be explained with reference to FIG. 6. Here, the blower fan unit<br>
25, the heat transfer tray 40 and the like-have been already installed within the<br>
insulating body 20. Further, the fixing rings 60 and the elastic support 62 have<br>
also been already installed within the refrigerating chamber 13.<br>
Under. these conditions, the insulating body 20 is pushed into the<br>
refrigerating chamber 13. Since a width of the insulating body 20 is smaller than<br>
an inside width of the refrigerating chamber 13, the .insulating body 20 is inserted<br>
into the refrigerating chamber 13 in a state where the insulating body comes into<br>
close contact with the inner surface of the refrigerating chamber opposite to the<br>
surface on which the fixing rings 60 are installed. Therefore, the fixing rings 60<br>
do not interfere with the surface of the insulating body 20 corresponding thereto.<br>
The insulating body 20 is.inserted into the.refrigerating chamber 13 in a<br>
state where a rear end. of the insulating body 20 comes into close contact with the<br>
elastic support 62. Simultaneously, the insulating body 20 is pushed toward the<br>
barrier 15 so that the fixing rings 60 can be snugly inserted into the cold air inlet<br>
20i and the cold air outlet 20e.<br>
Thus, the corner of the insulating body 20 is introduced into the seating<br>
groove 63 while elastically deforming one side of the elastic support 62. . Then,<br>
the fixing rings 60 are inserted and seated into the cold air inlet 20i and the cold<br>
air outlet 20e while they are guided along the inclined contact surfaces 21 of the<br>
cold air inlet 20i and the cold air outlet 20e, respectively.<br>
FIGS. 3 and 4 show the assembled state of the insulating body into the<br>
refrigerating chamber. At this time, the insulating body 20 is prevented from<br>
moving or playing within the refrigerating chamber, because each of the fixing<br>
rings 60 and the elastic support 62 is pressed by the insulting body 20 and<br>
elastically deformed to some extent. Further, the cold air does not leak out<br><br>
between the cold air supply port 17 and the cold air inlet 20i and between the cold<br>
air discharge port 18 and the cold air outlet 20e, because the fixing rings 60 are in<br>
close contact with the cold air inlet 20i and the cold air outlet 20e, respectively.<br>
The auxiliary storage compartment 50 of the present invention is not<br>
always installed within the refrigerating chamber 13. Alternatively, the auxiliary<br>
storage compartment 50 may be installed within the freezing chamber 12 so that it<br>
can be supplied with the cold air in the freezing chamber 12 so as to keep it at a<br>
predetermined temperature.<br>
As described specifically in the foregoing, the auxiliary storage system<br>
for use in the refrigerator according to the present invention is constructed such<br>
that the auxiliary storage compartment installed within the refrigerating chamber<br>
is isolated from the refrigerating chamber by means of the insulating body With<br>
such constitution, the interior of the auxiliary storage compartment is less<br>
influenced by the ambient environment, and thus, the set temperature thereof can<br>
be maintained more reliably. Thus, the goods stored in the auxiliary storage<br>
compartment can be stored longer and fresher.<br>
Further, according to the present invention,, the cold air supply port and,<br>
the cold air discharge port through which the cold air is supplied into and<br>
discharged from the insulating body, respectively, are formed at the locations<br>
corresponding to the rear and front ends of the insulating body, and thus, the cold<br>
air can flow from the rear end to the front end of the insulating body. Therefore,<br>
the heat exchange with the cold air is performed throughout the surface of the heat<br>
transfer tray installed within the insulating body. Accordingly, there is an<br>
advantage in that the temperature in the auxiliary storage compartment can be<br>
uniformly maintained as a whole.<br>
Furthermore, since the fixing rings and the elastic support which are made<br>
of elastic materials are utilized when installing the insulating body into the<br>
refrigerating chamber, the insulating body is firmly secured into the refrigerating<br>
chamber. The cold air transferred from the freezing chamber into the insulating<br>
body does not leak into the refrigerating chamber. Therefore, there is also an<br>
advantage in that the refrigerating chamber is not excessively cooled.<br><br>
It should be understood that a person skilled in the art to which the<br>
invention pertains may make various changes and modifications to the present<br>
invention within the scope of the present invention defined by the appended<br>
