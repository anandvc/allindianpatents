PYRROLO[2,3-b]PYRDMIDINES AS JANUS KINASE INHIBITORS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides heteroaryl substituted pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridines and heteroaryl<br>
substituted pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyrimidines that modulate the activity of Janus kinases and are useful in the<br>
treatment of diseases related to activity of Janus kinases including, for example, immune-related<br>
diseases, skin disorders, myeloid proliferative disorders, cancer, and other diseases.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Protein kinases (PKs) are a group of enzymes that regulate diverse, important biological<br>
processes including cell growth, survival and differentiation, organ formation and morphogenesis,<br>
neovascularization, tissue repair and regeneration, among others. Protein kinases exert their<br>
physiological functions through catalyzing the phosphorylation of proteins (or substrates) and thereby<br>
modulating the cellular activities of the substrates in various biological contexts. In addition to the<br>
functions in normal tissues/organs, many protein kinases also play more specialized roles in a host of<br>
human diseases including cancer. A subset of protein kinases (also referred to as oncogenic protein<br>
kinases), when dysregulated, can cause tumor formation and growth, and further contribute to tumor<br>
maintenance and progression (Blume-Jensen P et al, Nature 2001, 411(6835):355-365). Thus far,<br>
oncogenic protein kinases represent one of the largest and most attractive groups of protein targets for<br>
cancer intervention and drug development.<br>
Protein kinases can be categorized as receptor type and non-receptor type. Receptor tyrosine<br>
kinases (RTKs) have an extracellular portion, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular portion,<br>
while non-receptor tyrosine kinases are entirely intracellular. RTK mediated signal transduction is<br>
typically initiated by extracellular interaction with a specific growth factor (ligand), typically followed<br>
by receptor dimerization, stimulation of the intrinsic protein tyrosine kinase activity, and receptor<br>
transphosphorylation. Binding sites are thereby created for intracellular signal transduction molecules<br>
and lead to the formation of complexes with a spectrum of cytoplasmic signaling molecules that<br>
facilitate the appropriate cellular response such as cell division, differentiation, metabolic effects, and<br>
changes in the extracellular microenvironment<br>
At present, at least nineteen (19) distinct RTK subfamilies have been identified. One RTK<br>
subfamily, designated the HER subfamily, includes EGFR, HER2, HER3 and HER4, and bind such<br>
ligands as epithelial growth factor (EGF), TGF-ÔÅ°, amphiregulin, HB-EGF, betacellulin and heregulin.<br><br>
A second family of RTKs, designated theiuisulin subfamily, includes the INS-R, the IGF-1R and the<br>
IR-R. A third family, the "PDGF" subfamily, includes the RDGF alpha and beta receptors, CSFIR, c-<br>
kit and FJJfC-H. Another subfamily of RTKs, referred to as the FLK subfamily, encompasses the<br>
Kinase insert Domain-Receptor fetal liver kinase-1 (KDR/FLK-1), the fetal liver kinase 4 (FLK-4)<br>
and the fins-like tyrosine kinase 1 (flt-1). Two other subfamilies of RTKs have been designated as the<br>
FGF receptor family (FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3 and FGFR4) and the Met subfamily (c-Met, Ron and<br>
Sea). For a detailed discussion of protein kinases, see for example, Blume-Jensen, P. et ah, Nature.<br>
2001, 411(6835):355-365, and Manning, G. et al., Science. 2002, 298(5600): 1912-1934.<br>
The non-receptor type of tyrosine kinases is also composed of numerous subfamilies,<br>
including Src, Btk, Abl, Fak, and Jak. Each of these subfamilies can be further subdivided into<br>
multiple members that have been frequently linked to oncogenesis. The Src family, for example, is<br>
the largest and includes Src, Fyn, Lck and Fgr among others. For a detailed discussion of these<br>
kinases, see Bolen JB. Nonreceptor tyrosine protein kinases. Oncogene. 1993, 8(8):2025-31.<br>
A significant number of tyrosine kinases (both receptor and nonreceptor) are associated with<br>
cancer (see Madhusudan S, Ganesan TS. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors in cancer therapy. Clin Biochem.<br>
2004, 37(7):618-35.)- Clinical studies suggest that overexpression or dysregulation of tyrosine<br>
kinases may also be of prognostic value. For example, members of the HER family of RTKs have<br>
been associated with poor prognosis in breast, colorectal, head and neck and lung cancer. Mutation of<br>
c-Kit tyrosine kinase is associated with decreased survival in gastrointestinal stromal tumors. In acute<br>
myelogenous leukemia, Flt-3 mutation predicts shorter disease free survival. VEGFR expression,<br>
which is important for tumor angiogenesis, is associated with a lower survival rate in lung cancer.<br>
Tie-1 kinase expression inversely correlates with survival in gastric cancer. BCR-Abl expression is<br>
an important predictor of response in chronic myelogenous leukemia and Src tyrosine kinase is an<br>
indicator of poor prognosis in all stages of colorectal cancer.<br>
The immune system responds to injury and threats from pathogens. Cytokines are low-<br>
molecular weight polypeptides or glycoproteins that stimulate biological responses in virtually all cell<br>
types. For example, cytokines regulate many of the pathways involved in the host inflammatory<br>
response to sepsis. Cytokines influence cell differentiation, proliferation and activation, and they can<br>
modulate both proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses to allow the host to react<br>
appropriately to pathogens.<br>
Binding of a cytokine to its cell surface receptor initiates intracellular signaling cascades that<br>
transduce the extracellular signal to the nucleus, ultimately leading to changes in gene expression. The<br>
pathway involving the Janus kinase family of protein tyrosine kinases (JAKs) and Signal Transducers<br>
and Activators of Transcription (STATs) is engaged in the signaling of a wide range of cytokines.<br>
Generally, cytokine receptors do not have intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, and thus require receptor-<br>
associated kinases to propagate a phosphorylation cascade. JAKs fulfill this function. Cytokines bind<br>
to their receptors, causing receptor dimerization, and this enables JAKs to phosphorylate each other as<br><br>
well as specific tyrosine motifs within the cytokine receptors. STATs that recognize these<br>
phosphotyrosine motifs are recruited to the receptor, and are then themselves activated by a JAK-<br>
dependent tyrosine phosphorylation event. Upon activation, STATs dissociate from the receptors,<br>
dimerize, and translocate to the nucleus to bind to specific DNA sites and alter transcription (Scott, M.<br>
J., C. J. Godshall, et al. (2002). "Jaks, STATs, Cytokines, and Sepsis." Clin Diagn Lab Immunol 9(6):<br>
1153-9).<br>
The JAK family plays a role in the cytokine-dependent regulation of proliferation and<br>
function of cells involved in immune response. Currently, there are four known mammalian JAK<br>
family members: JAK1 (also known as Janus kinase-1), JAK2 (also known as Janus kinase-2), JAK3<br>
(also known as Janus kinase, leukocyte; JAKL; L-JAK and Janus kinase-3) and TYK2 (also known as<br>
protein-tyrosine kinase 2). The JAK proteins range in size from 120 to 140 kDa and comprise seven<br>
conserved JAK homology (JH) domains; one of these is a functional catalytic kinase domain, and<br>
another is a pseudokinase domain potentially serving a regulatory function and/or serving as a<br>
docking site for STATs (Scott, Godshall et al. 2002, supra).<br>
While JAK1, JAK2 and TYK2 are ubiquitously expressed, JAK3 is reported to be<br>
preferentially expressed in natural killer (NK) cells and not resting T cells, suggesting a role in<br>
lymphoid activation (Kawamura, M., D. W. McVicar, et al. (1994). "Molecular cloning of L-JAK, a<br>
Janus family protein-tyrosine kinase expressed in natural killer cells and activated leukocytes." Proc<br>
Natl Acad Sci USA 91(14): 6374-8).<br>
Not only do the cytokine-stimulated immune and inflammatory responses contribute to<br>
normal host defense, they also play roles in the pathogenesis of diseases: pathologies such as severe<br>
combined immunodeficiency (SCID) arise from hypoactivity and suppression of the immune system,<br>
and a hyperactive or inappropriate immune / inflammatory response contributes to the pathology of<br>
autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid and psoriatic arthritis, asthma and systemic lupus<br>
erythematosus, inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis, type I diabetes mellitus, myasthenia<br>
gravis, thyroiditis, immunoglobulin nephropathies, myocarditis as well as illnesses such as<br>
scleroderma and osteoarthritis (Ortmann, R. A., T. Cheng, et al. (2000). "Janus kinases and signal<br>
transducers and activators of transcription: their roles in cytokine signaling, development and<br>
immunoregulation." Arthritis Res 2(1): 16-32). Furthermore, syndromes with a mixed presentation of<br>
autoimmune and immunodeficiency disease are quite common (Candotti, F., L. Notarangelo, et at.<br>
(2002). "Molecular aspects of primary immunodeficiencies: lessons from cytokine and other signaling<br>
pathways." J Clin Invest 109(10): 1261-9). Thus, therapeutic agents are typically aimed at<br>
augmentation or suppression of the immune and inflammatory pathways, accordingly.<br>
Deficiencies in expression of JAK family members are associated with disease states. Jakl-/-<br>
mice are runted at birth, fail to nurse, and die perinatally (Rodig, S. J., M. A. Meraz, et al. (1998).<br>
"Disruption of the Jakl gene demonstrates obligatory and nonredundant roles of the Jaks in cytokine-<br>
induced biologic responses." Cell 93(3): 373-83). Jak2-/- mouse embryos are anemic and die around<br><br>
day 12.5 postcoitum due to the absence of definitive erythropoiesis. JAK2-deficient fibroblasts do not<br>
respond to IFN gamma, although responses to IFNalpha/beta and IL-6 are unaffected. JAK2 functions<br>
in signal transduction of a specific group of cytokine receptors required in definitive erythropoiesis<br>
(Neubauer, H., A. Cumano, et al. (1998). Cell 93(3): 397-409; Parganas, E., D. Wang, et al. (1998).<br>
Cell 93(3): 385-95.)- JAK3 appears to play a role in normal development and function of B and T<br>
lymphocytes. Mutations of JAK3 are reported to be responsible for autosomal recessive severe<br>
combined immunodeficiency (SCID) in humans (Candotti, F., S. A. Oakes, et al. (1997). "Structural<br>
and functional basis for JAK3-deficient severe combined immunodeficiency." Blood 90(10): 3996-<br>
4003).<br>
The JAK/STAT pathway, and in particular all four members of the JAK family, are believed<br>
to play a role in the pathogenesis of the asthmatic response, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,<br>
bronchitis, and other related inflammatory diseases of the lower respiratory tract. For instance, the<br>
inappropriate immune responses that characterize asthma are orchestrated by a subset of CD4+ T<br>
helper cells termed T helper 2 (Th2) cells. Signaling through the cytokine receptor JX-4 stimulates<br>
JAK1 and JAK3 to activate STAT6, and signaling through IL-12 stimulates activation of JAK2 and<br>
TYK2, and subsequent phosphorylation of STAT4. STAT4 and STAT6 control multiple aspects of<br>
CD4+ T helper cell differentiation (Pernis, A. B. and P. B. Rothman (2002). "JAK-STAT signaling in<br>
asthma." J Clin Invest 109(10): 1279-83). Furthermore, TYK2-deficient mice were found to have<br>
enhanced Th2 cell-mediated allergic airway inflammation (Seto, Y., H. Nakajima, et al. (2003).<br>
"Enhanced Th2 cell-mediated allergic inflammation in Tyk2-deficient mice." J Immunol 170(2):<br>
1077-83). Moreover, multiple cytokines that signal through JAK kinases have been linked to<br>
inflammatory diseases or conditions of the upper respiratory tract such as those affecting the nose and<br>
sinuses {e.g. rhinitis, sinusitis) whether classically allergic reactions or not.<br>
The JAK/STAT pathway has also been implicated to play a role in inflammatory<br>
diseases/conditions of the eye including, but not limited to, iritis, uveitis, scleritis, conjunctivitis, as<br>
well as chronic allergic responses. Therefore, inhibition of JAK kinases may have a beneficial role in<br>
the therapeutic treatment of these diseases.<br>
The JAK/STAT pathway, and in particular, JAK3, also plays a role in cancers of the immune<br>
system. In adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL), human CD4+ T cells acquire a transformed<br>
phenotype, an event that correlates with acquisition of constitutive phosphorylation of JAKs and<br>
STATs. Furthermore, an association between JAK3 and STAT-1, STAT-3, and STAT-5 activation<br>
and cell-cycle progression was demonstrated by both propidium iodide staining and<br>
bromodeoxyuridine incorporation in cells of four ATLL patients tested. These results imply that<br>
JAK/STAT activation is associated with replication of leukemic cells and that therapeutic approaches<br>
aimed at JAK/STAT inhibition may be considered to halt neoplastic growth (Takemoto, S., J. C.<br>
Mulloy, et al. (1997). "Proliferation of adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma cells is associated with the<br>
constitutive activation of JAK/STAT proteins." Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 94(25): 13897-902).<br><br>
Blocking signal transduction at the level of the JAK kinases holds promise for developing<br>
treatments for hitman cancers. Cytokines of the interleukin 6 (IL-6) family, which activate the signal<br>
transducer gp130, are major survival and growth factors for human multiple myeloma (MM) cells.<br>
The signal transduction of gp130 is believed to involve JAK1, JAK2 and Tyk2 and the downstream<br>
effectors STAT3 and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. In IL-6-dependent MM<br>
cell lines treated with the JAK2 inhibitor tyrphostin AG490, JAK2 kinase activity and ERK2 and<br>
STAT3 phosphorylation were inhibited. Furthermore, cell proliferation was suppressed and apoptosis<br>
was induced (De Vos, J., M. Jourdan, et al. (2000). "JAK2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor tyrphostin AG490<br>
downregulates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and signal transducer and activator of<br>
transcription (STAT) pathways and induces apoptosis in myeloma cells." Br J Haematol 109(4): 823-<br>
8). However, in some cases, AG490 can induce dormancy of tumor cells and actually then protect<br>
them from death.<br>
Activation of JAK/STAT in cancers may occur by multiple mechanisms including cytokine<br>
stimulation (e.g. IL-6 or GM-CSF) or by a reduction in the endogenous suppressors of JAK signaling<br>
such as SOCS (suppressor or cytokine signaling) or PIAS (protein inhibitor of activated STAT)<br>
(Boudny, V., and Kovarik, J., Neoplasm. 49:349-355, 2002). Importantly, activation of STAT<br>
signaling, as well as other pathways downstream of JAKs (e.g. Akt), has been correlated with poor<br>
prognosis in many cancer types (Bowman, T., et al. Oncogene 19:2474-2488, 2000). Moreover,<br>
elevated levels of circulating cytokines that signal through JAK/STAT may adversely impact patient<br>
health as they are thought to play a causal role in cachexia and/or chronic fatigue. As such, JAK<br>
inhibition may be therapeutic for the treatment of cancer patients for reasons that extend beyond<br>
potential anti-tumor activity. The cachexia indication may gain further mechanistic support with<br>
realization that the satiety factor leptin signals through JAKs.<br>
Pharmacological targeting of Janus kinase 3 (JAK3) has been employed successfully to<br>
control allograft rejection and graft versus host disease (GVHD). In addition to its involvement in<br>
signaling of cytokine receptors, JAK3 is also engaged in the CD40 signaling pathway of peripheral<br>
blood monocytes. During CD40-induced maturation of myeloid dendritic cells (DCs), JAK3 activity<br>
is induced, and increases in costimulatory molecule expression, IL-12 production, and potent<br>
allogeneic stimulatory capacity are observed. A rationally designed JAK3 inhibitor WHI-P-154<br>
prevented these effects arresting the DCs at an immature level, suggesting that immunosuppressive<br>
therapies targeting the tyrosine kinase JAK3 may also affect the function of myeloid cells (Saemann,<br>
M. D., C. Diakos, et al. (2003). "Prevention of CD40-triggered dendritic cell maturation and induction<br>
of T-cell hyporeactivity by targeting of Janus kinase 3." Am J Transplant 3(11): 1341-9). In the<br>
mouse model system, JAK3 was also shown to be an important molecular target for treatment of<br>
autoimmune insulin-dependent (type 1) diabetes mellitus. The rationally designed JAK3 inhibitor<br>
JANEX-1 exhibited potent immunomodulatory activity and delayed the onset of diabetes in the NOD<br>
mouse model of autoimmune type 1 diabetes (Cetkovic-Cvrlje, M., A. L. Dragt, et al. (2003).<br><br>
"Targeting JAK3 with JANEX-1 for prevention of autoimmune type 1 diabetes in NOD mice." Clin<br>
Immunol 106(3): 213-25).<br>
It has been suggested that inhibition of JAK2 tyrosine kinase can be beneficial for patients<br>
with myeloproliferative disorder. (Levin, et al, Cancer Cell, vol. 7, 2005: 387-397)<br>
Myeloproliferative disorder (MPD) includes polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia<br>
(ET), myeloid metaplasia with myelofibrosis (MMM), chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML),<br>
chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) and systemic mast<br>
cell disease (SMCD). Although the myeloproliferative disorder (such as PV, ET and MMM) are<br>
thought to be caused by acquired somatic mutation in hematopoietic progenitors, the genetic basis for<br>
these diseases has not been known. However, it has been reported that hematopoietic cells from a<br>
majority of patients with PV and a significant number of patients with ET and MMM possess a<br>
recurrent somatic activating mutation in the JAK2 tyrosine kinase. It has also been reported that<br>
inhibition of the JAK2V617F kinase with a small molecule inhibitor leads to inhibition of<br>
proliferation of hematopoietic cells, suggesting that the JAK2 tyrosine kinase is a potential target for<br>
pharmacologic inhibition in patients with PV, ET and MMM.<br>
Inhibition of the JAK kinases is also envisioned to have therapeutic benefits in patients<br>
suffering from skin immune disorders such as psoriasis, and skin sensitization. In psoriasis vulgaris,<br>
the most common form of psoriasis, it has been generally accepted that activated T lymphocytes are<br>
important for the maintenance of the disease and its associated psoriatic plaques (Gottlieb, A.B., et al,<br>
Nat Rev Drug Disc, 4:19-34). Psoriatic plaques contain a significant immune infiltrate, including<br>
leukocytes and monocytes, as well as multiple epidermal layers with increased keratinocyte<br>
proliferation. While the initial activation of immune cells in psoriasis occurs by an ill defined<br>
mechanism, the maintenance is believed to be dependent on a number of inflammatory cytokines, in<br>
addition to various chemokines and growth factors (JCI, 113:1664-1675). Many of these, including<br>
interleukins -2, -4, -6, -7, -12, -15, -18, and -23 as well as GM-CSF and EFNg, signal through the<br>
Janus (JAK) kinases (Adv Pharmacol. 2000;47:113-74). As such, blocking signal transduction at the<br>
level of JAK kinases may result in therapeutic benefits in patients suffering from psoriasis or other<br>
immune disorders of the skin.<br>
It has been known that certain therapeutics can cause immune reactions such as skin rash or<br>
diarrhea in some patients. For instance, administration of some of the new targeted anti-cancer agents<br>
such as Iressa, Erbitux, and Tarceva has induced acneiform rash with some patients. Another example<br>
is that some therapeutics used topically induce skin irritation, skin rash, contact dermatitis or allergic<br>
contact sensitization. For some patients, these immune reactions may be bothersome, but for others,<br>
the immune reactions such as rash or diarrhea may result in inability to continue the treatment.<br>
Although the driving force behind these immune reactions has not been elucidated completely at the<br>
present time, these immune reactions are likely linked to immune infiltrate.<br><br>
Inhibitors of Janus kinases or related kinases are widely sought and several publications<br>
report effective classes of compounds. For example, certain inhibitors are reported in WO 99/65909,<br>
US 2004/0198737; WO 2004/099204; WO 2004/099205; and WO 01/42246. Heteroaryl substituted<br>
pyrroles and other compounds are reported in WO 2004/72063 and WO 99/62908.<br>
Thus, new or improved agents which inhibit kinases such as Janus kinases are continually<br>
needed that act as immunosuppressive agents for organ transpiants, as well as agents for the<br>
prevention and treatment of autoimmune diseases (e.g., multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis,<br>
asthma, type I diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, autoimmune thyroid disorders,<br>
Alzheimer's disease), diseases involving a hyperactive inflammatory response (e.g., eczema),<br>
allergies, cancer (e.g., prostate, leukemia, multiple myeloma), and some immune reactions (e.g., skin<br>
rash or contact dermatitis or diarrhea) caused by other therapeutics, to name a few. The compounds,<br>
compositions and methods described herein are directed toward these needs and other ends.<br>

In some embodiments, the compound has Formula la or Ib:<br><br><br><br><br><br>
At various places in the present specification, substituents of compounds of the invention are<br>
disclosed in groups or in ranges. It is specifically intended that the invention include each and every<br>
individual subcombination of the members of such groups and ranges. For example, the term "C1-6<br>
alkyl" is specifically intended to individually disclose methyl, ethyl, C3 alkyl, C4 alkyl, C5 alkyl, and<br>
C6 alkyl.<br>
It is further appreciated that certain features of the invention, which are, for clarity, described<br>
in the context of separate embodiments, can also be provided in combination in a single embodiment.<br>
Conversely, various features of the invention which are, for brevity, described in the context of a<br>
single embodiment, can also be provided separately or in any suitable subcombination.<br>
At various places in the present specification, linking substituents are described. It is<br>
specifically intended that each linking substituent include both the forward and backward forms of the<br>
linking substituent. For example, -NR(CRR")n- includes both NR(CR'R")n and -(CR'R")nNR<br>
Where the structure clearly requires a linking group, the Markush variables listed for that group are<br>
understood to be linking groups. For example, if the structure requires a linking group and the<br>
Markush group definition for that variable lists "alkyl" or "aryl" then it is understood that the "alkyl"<br>
or "aryl" represents a linking alkylene group or arylene group, respectively.<br>
The term "n-membered" where n is an integer typically describes the number of ring-forming<br>
atoms in a moiety where the number of ring-forming atoms is n. For example, piperidinyl is an<br>
example of a 6-membered heterocycloalkyl ring and 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-naphthalene is an example of<br>
a 10-membered cycloalkyl group.<br>
As used herein, the term "alkyl" is meant to refer to a saturated hydrocarbon group which is<br>
straight-chained or branched. Example alkyl groups include methyl (Me), ethyl (Et), propyl (e.g., n-<br>
propyl and isopropyl), butyl (e.g., n-butyl, isobutyl, t-butyl), pentyl (e.g., n-pentyl, isopentyl,<br>
neopentyl), and the like. An alkyl group can contain from 1 to about 20, from 2 to about 20, from 1 to<br>

about 80%, at least about 90%, at least about 95%, at least about 97%, or at least about 99% by<br>
weight of the compound of the invention, or salt thereof. Methods for isolating compounds and their<br>
salts are routine in the art.<br>
The expressions, "ambient temperature" and "room temperature," as used herein, are<br>
understood in the art, and refer generally to a temperature, e.g a reaction temperature, that is about the<br>
temperature of the room in which the reaction is carried out, for example, a temperature from about<br>
20 ¬∞C to about 30 ¬∞C.<br>

inorganic or organic acids. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the present invention can be<br>
synthesized from the parent compound which contains a basic or acidic moiety by conventional<br>
chemical methods. Generally, such salts can be prepared by reacting the free acid or base forms of<br>
these compounds with a stoichiometric amount of the appropriate base or acid in water or in an<br>
organic solvent, or in a mixture of the two; generally, nonaqueous media like ether, ethyl acetate,<br>
ethanol, isopropanol, or acetonitrile (MeCN) are preferred. Lists of suitable salts are found in<br>

amino, sulfhydryl, or carboxyl groups are bonded to any group that, when administered to a<br>
mammalian subject, cleaves to form a free hydroxyl, amino, sulfhydryl, or carboxyl group<br>
respectively. Examples of prodrugs include, but are not limited to, acetate, formate and benzoate<br>
derivatives of alcohol and amine functional groups in the compounds of the invention. Preparation<br><br>

Compounds of the invention, including salts thereof, can be prepared using known organic<br>
synthesis techniques and can be synthesized according to any of numerous possible synthetic routes.<br>
The reactions for preparing compounds of the invention can be carried out in suitable solvents<br>
which can be readily selected by one of skill in the art of organic synthesis. Suitable solvents can be<br>
substantially nonreactive with the starting materials (reactants), the intermediates, or products at the<br>
temperatures at which the reactions are carried out, e.g., temperatures which can range from the<br>
solvent's freezing temperature to the solvent's boiling temperature. A given reaction can be carried out<br>
in one solvent or a mixture of more than one solvent. Depending on the particular reaction step,<br>
suitable solvents for a particular reaction step can be selected by the skilled artisan.<br>
Preparation of compounds of the invention can involve the protection and deprotection of<br>
various chemical groups. The need for protection and deprotection, and the selection of appropriate<br>
protecting groups, can be readily determined by one skilled in the art. The chemistry of protecting<br>
groups can be found, for example, in T.W. Green and P.G.M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic<br>
Synthesis, 3rd. Ed., Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York (1999), which is incorporated herein by reference<br>
in its entirety.<br>
Reactions can be monitored according to any suitable method known in the art. For example,<br>
product formation can be monitored by spectroscopic means, such as nuclear magnetic resonance<br>
spectroscopy (e.g., *H or 13C) infrared spectroscopy, spectrophotometry (e.g., UV-visible), or mass<br>
spectrometry, or by chromatography such as high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or thin<br>
layer chromatography.<br>
Compounds of the invention can be prepared according to numerous preparatory routes<br>
known in the literature. Example synthetic methods for preparing compounds of the invention are<br>
provided in the Schemes below.<br>
As shown in Scheme 1, pyrazole-containing cores 1-9 and 1-6 can be synthesized starting<br>
with pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridine or pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyrimidine 1-1. The compound 1-1 can be converted to<br>
an active species such as an N-oxide analog (1-2) by using an oxidant such as m-CPBA. The N-oxide<br>
1-2 can be halogenated with a halogenating agent such as a combination of tetramethylammonium<br>
bromide and methanesulfonic anhydride to form a 4-halo compound 1-3 such as a 4-bromo compound<br>
while the N-oxide is reduced at the same time. The amine group of the compound 1-3 can be<br>
protected by a suitable amine protecting group to afford the protected compound 1-7, which<br>
subsequently undergoes a Suzuki coupling with a boric acid 1-8 to afford the pyrazole-containing<br><br>
cores l-9a which can be further reacted with reagent L-(Y)n-Z (where L is a leaving group) to give<br>
compounds of the invention l-9b. Alternatively, the N-oxide 1-2 can be halogenated with a<br>
halogenating agent such as MeSO2Cl to form a 4-halo compound 1-4 such as a 4-chloro compound<br>
while the N-oxide is reduced at the same time. The 4-halo compound 1-4 can be coupled to a bromo-<br>
substituted pyrazole compound 1-5 under suitable conditions such as heating to afford the pyrazole-<br>
containing core 1-6, which may contain some functional groups such as bromo or cyano suitable for<br>
further chemical modification.<br>
Similarly, an imidazole core 1-11 can be synthesized by coupling of the 4-halo compound 1-4<br>
to an imidazole derivative 1-10 under suitable conditions such as heating to afford the imidazole-<br>
containing core 1-11, which may contain some functional groups such as bromo or cyano suitable for<br>
further chemical modification.<br><br>
As shown in Scheme 2, pyrazole-containmg cores 2-3, 2-5 and 2-6 can be synthesized starting<br>
with a bromo-substituted pyrazole derivative 2-1 (a compound 1-6 in Scheme 1 wherein one of R5 is<br><br>
Br). The bromo-substituted pyrazole derivative 2-1 can be coupled to boron-containing aromatic<br>
species such as an aromatic boric acid 2-2 using Suzuki coupling wherein Ar is aryl or heteroaryl,<br>
each of which can be optionally substituted by one or more substituents such as alky, aryl, CN, nitro,<br>
alkoxy, etc. Alternatively, an alkene- or alkyne-containing compound such as an alkene-containing 2-<br>
5 can be obtained by coupling the bromo-substituted pyrazole derivative 2-1 to an unsaturated<br>
compound such as an alkene 2-4 in the presence of a metal catalyst such as bis(triphenylphcs-<br>
phine)palladium (IT) chloride wherein t can be 0, 1, 2, and the like; and R can be a substituent such as<br>
alkyl, aryl, CN, nitro, alkoxy, etc. The alkene group of compound 2-5 can be reduced by<br>
hydrogenation to afford the corresponding compound 2-6.<br><br>
As shown in Scheme 3, imidazole-containing cores 3-7 can be synthesized starting with an N-<br>
protected 4-bromo-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridine or an N-protected 4-bromo-pvrrolo[2,3-b]pyrimidine 3-1<br>
wherein P is a suitable amine protecting group such as {[2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxy]methyl} (SEM).<br>
Compound 3-1 can be reacted with a Grignard reagent such as isopropyl magnesium chloride to<br>
generate an aromatic anion through ion exchange. The subsequent addition of a chloroacetyl-<br>
containing compound such as 2-chloro-N-methoxy-N-methylacetarnide 3-2 to the anion will typically<br>
afford the chloroacetyl derivative 3-3. The derivative 3-3 can be reacted with an organic acid salt<br>
such as a cesium salt R5CO2Cs to afford a compound 3-4. In the presence of a suitable ammonia<br>
source such as ammonium acetate, the compound 3-4 can react with ammonia under suitable<br>
conditions such as at a high temperature to form the imidazole ring of the compound 3-5. The free<br><br>
amine nitrogen of the imidazole derivative 3-5 can undergo further modification such as reacting with<br>
a compound X-(Y)n-Z where X is a leaving group such as chloro, bromo or iodo so as to afford<br>
compound 3-6. The protecting group of compound 3-6 can be removed by an appropriate method<br>
according to the nature of the protecting group to yield compound 3-7. It should be noted that if there<br>
are functional groups present within the R, R5, and ‚Äî(Y)n-Z group, further modification can be made.<br>
For example, a CN group can be hydrolyzed to afford an amide group; a carboxylic acid can be<br>
converted to a ester, which in turn can be further reduced to an alcohol, which in turn can be further<br>
modified. One skilled in the art will recognize appropriate further modifications.<br><br>
As shown in scheme 4, thiazole-contammg cores 4-3 can be synthesized starting with an N-<br>
protected chloroacetyl derivative 4-1 wherein P is a suitable amine protecting group such as SEM.<br>
Compound 4-1 can be reacted with a thioamide 4-2 to form the thiazole ring, followed by<br>
deprotection of the amine nitrogen of the pyrrole ring by removal of the P group to afford the<br>
compound 4-3. Various thioureas 4-5 (equivalent to compound 4-2 wherein ‚Äî (Y)n-Z is NR'R"; and<br>
R* and R" are H, alkyl, aryl or the like; or R' and R" together with the N atom to which they are<br>
attached form a heterocycloalkyl) useful in preparing the thiazole compounds 4-3 can be made from<br>
secondary amines 4-4. A secondary amine 4-4 can be reacted with 1,1 '-thiocarbonyldiimidazole; and<br>
the resulting intermediate can further be reacted with ammonia to afford a thiourea 4-S.<br><br><br>
As shown in Scheme 5, thiazole-containing cores 5-5 can be synthesized starting with a<br>
thiazole compound 5-1. The compound 5-1 can be reacted with a metal alkyl such as n-butyl lithium<br>
via ion exchange to generate an aromatic anion in situ. The subsequent addition of boric acid<br>
trimethyl ester followed by hydrolysis will typically afford the boric acid 5-2. The boric acid 5-2 can<br>
undergo Suzuki coupling with an N-protected 4-bromo-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridine or an N-protected 4-<br>
bromo-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyrimidine 5-3 wherein P is a suitable amine protecting group such as SEM.<br>
The protecting group P of the coupling product 5-4 can be removed by an appropriate method<br>
according to the nature of the protecting group to yield the compound of the invention 5-5.<br><br>
As shown in Scheme 6, pyrazole-containing compounds 6-1 can further be modified by<br>
substitution on the pyrazole NH group with appropriate reagents. For example, a compound 6-1<br><br>
wherein P is a suitable amine protecting group such as SEM can be reacted with L-(Y)n-Z where L<br>
represents a leaving group such as halo, triflate or the like to afford compound 6-2 under basic<br>
condition. If there are some functional groups present within the Y and/or Z group, further<br>
modification can be made. For example, a CN group can be hydrolyzed to afford an amide group; a<br>
carboxylic acid can be converted to a ester, which in turn can be further reduced to alcohol. One<br>
skilled in the art will recognize the further modifications if appropriate.<br>
Additionally, compound 6-1 can be reacted with alkene 6-3 (wherein R' and R" can be H,<br>
alkyl, cycloalkyl and the like; and Z' can be an electron withdrawing group such as an ester or CN) to<br>
afford the compound 6-4. Further, substitution can be made on alkene 6-3 at the alpha position (alpha<br>
to Z') to generate a substituted derivatives of product, 6-4 (see, e.g., Example 68).<br>
Compounds 6-2 and 6-4 can be deprotected by appropriate methods according to the nature of<br>
the protecting group used to afford their corresponding de-protected counterpart.<br><br>
As shown in Scheme 7, bromo pyrazole containing compounds 7-1 can be further modified<br>
by metallation with reagents like butyl lithium and reaction with electrophiles like aldehydes to give<br>
the alcohol containing compounds 7-2 which can be deprotected to yield compounds of the invention<br>
having formula 7-3. One skilled in the art will recognize the further modifications where appropriate.<br><br><br>
As shown in Scheme 8, pyrazole-containing compounds 8-4 and 8-5 can be prepared by<br>
reaction of the N-protected bromo compound 8-1 with hydrazine in an appropriate solvent such as<br>
iV;Af-dimethylformamide (DMF) to give the hydrazine intermediate 8-2. The hydrazino intermediate<br>
8-2 is reacted with an appropriately substituted 1,3 bis-aldehyde like 8-3 to give the pyrazole<br>
containing compound 8-4. If there are some functional groups present within the Y and/or Z group,<br>
further modification can be made. For example, a CN group can be hydrolyzed to afford an amide<br>
group; a carboxylic acid can be converted to a ester, which in turn can be further reduced to alcohol.<br>
One skilled in the art will recognize further potential modifications.<br><br>
As shown in Scheme 9, the 1,2,4-oxadiazole compound 9-6 can prepared from the N-<br>
protected bromo compound 9-1 by treatment with zinc cyanide in DMF in the presence of a catalyst<br>
like bis(tributyl) palladium to give the N-protected cyano compound 9-2. The N-hydroxy carbox-<br>
imidamide compound 9-3 can be prepared by heating the N-protected cyano compound 9-2 with<br>
hydroxylamine hydrochloride in an appropriate solvent like ethanol and a base like potassium<br>
carbonate at a temperature below the boiling point of the solvent. The N-protected 1,2,4-oxadiazole<br>
compound can be prepared by treating the N-hydroxy carboximidamide compound 9-3 with an<br>
appropriately substituted acid chloride compound 9-4 in a solvent like pyridine at a sufficient<br>
temperature to complete the ring closure. If there are some functional groups present within the Y<br>
and/or Z group, further modification can be made. For example, a CN group can be hydrolyzed to<br><br>
afford an amide group; a carboxylic acid can be converted to an ester, which in turn can be further<br>
reduced to alcohol. One skilled in the art will recognize further modifications where appropriate.<br><br>
As shown in Scheme 10, the 3- and 4-arylpyrazolo compounds 10-9 can be prepared by<br>
reaction of the respective 3-arylpyrazolo compound 10-4 or 4-aryl pyrazolo compound 10-7 with an<br>
appropriately substituted bromo compound 10-8 as previously described. The 3-aryl pyrazolo<br>
compound 10-4 can be prepared by reacting an appropriately substituted aryl group containing a<br>
halogen like bromo or a triflate with the N-protected boronic acid or boronic acid ester pyrazole<br>
compound 10-2 under Suzuki-like conditions known in the literature. The N-protecting group of 10-3<br>
can be removed by conditions previously described and known in the literature for removing groups<br>
like SEM.<br>
The 4-arylpyrazolo compounds 10-7 can be prepared by reacting the appropriately<br>
substituted acetophenone compound 10-5 with DMF acetal in DMF at elevated temperatures to give<br>
the dimethylamino compound 10-6. The 4-arylpyrazolo compounds 10-7 can be prepared by treating<br>
the dimethylamino compound 10-6 with hydrazine in a solvent such as ethanol.<br><br><br>
As shown in Scheme 11 the substituted pyrazole compound 11-5 can be prepared by a variety<br>
of methods, such as by removing the protecting group e.g., SEM from compound 11-4 under<br>
conditions previously described. For example the substituted pyrazole N-protected compound 11-4<br>
can be prepared by reaction of the intermediate pyrazole N-protected compound 11-3 with an<br>
appropriately substituted alkyl halide, benzyl halide, alkyl sulfonates, e.g., mesylate or tosylate, or<br>
other suitable leaving group L, in an appropriate solvent such as MeCN, DMF or tetrahydrofuran<br>
(THF), in the presence of a base such a sodium hydride or cesium carbonate. The N-aryl pyrazole 11-<br>
4 (wherein Y is aromatic) may be prepared by reacting the intermediate pyrazole 11-3 with an<br>
appropriately substituted aryl boronic acid in a solvent such as dichloromethane (DCM) with copper<br>
acetate and pyridine. Alternatively the N-aryl pyrazole 11-4 (wherein Y is aromatic) can be prepared<br>
by reacting the intermediate pyrazole 11-3 with an appropriately substituted aryl-fluoride in a solvent<br>
such as DMF at elevated temperature. Or, the substituted pyrazole compounds 11-4 (wherein Z is a<br>
group such as nitrile or ester and Y is at least two carbons) can be prepared by the reaction of<br>
intermediate pyrazole 11-3 with an appropriately substituted acrylate, acrylonitrile or other Michael-<br>
like acceptors in a solvent such as DMF in the presence of a base such as 1,8-<br>
diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU) or triethylamine (TEA) and at a temperature below the boiling<br>
point of the solvent. If there are some functional groups present within the Y and/or Z group, further<br>
modification can be made. For example, a CN group can be hydrolyzed to afford an amide group; a<br>
carboxylic acid can be converted to a ester, which in turn can be further reduced to alcohol. One<br>
skilled in the art will recognize the further modifications if appropriate.<br><br><br>
As shown in Scheme 12, pyrazole 12-1 wherein P is a suitable amine protecting group such as<br>
SEM can be reacted with an alkyne-containing conjugate acceptor such as 12-2, wherein Z is an<br>
electron-withdrawing group (for example, -CN) optionally in the presence of a base (DBU or K2CO3<br>
and the like) in a solvent such as DMF or MeCN for variable lengths of time to provide olefin-<br>
containing adducts 12-3. Compounds represented by the formula 12-3 can be deprotected by<br>
appropriate methods according to the nature of the protecting group used to afford compounds of the<br>
invention 12-4.<br><br>
As shown in Scheme 13, oxazole- or thiazole-containing compounds 13-6 can be prepared<br>
starting with N-protected 4-chloro-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyrimidine 13-1 wherein P is a suitable amine<br>
protecting group such as SEM. Oxazole- or thiazole-containing products of formula 13-2 can be<br><br>
prepared by palladium-catalyzed coupling of 13-1 with oxazole or thiazole. The compound 13-2 can<br>
be reacted with a metal alkyl such as n-butyllithium to generate the aromatic anion in situ to which<br>
can be added at low temperatures (preferably between -78¬∞C and 0¬∞C) derivatives of carboxylic acids<br>
13-3 (wherein W = N(Me)(OMe) when X1=S; and W = Cl when X'=O), in the presence of other<br>
additives such as zinc chloride and copper(I) iodide when X1=O, in a suitable solvent such as THF to<br>
generate a variety of ketones 13-4. Ketones 13-4 can be caused to react with a variety of reagents<br>
such as diethyl (cyanomethyl)phosphonate or triethylphosphonoacetate in the presence of a base like<br>
potassium tert-butoxide followed by reduction (including hydrogenation or a copper-hydride<br>
catalyzed conjugate reduction), or with reagents such as tosylmethyl isocyanide to provide products of<br>
formula 13-5 wherein Z is an electron-withdrawing group such as ester or -CN. If there are functional<br>
groups present within the R group or encompassed by the Z group, further modification can be made,<br>
and such appropriate further modifications will be recognized by one skilled in the art. Compounds<br>
13-5 can be deprotected by appropriate methods according to the nature of the protecting group used<br>
to afford their corresponding deprotected counterparts 13-6.<br><br>
As shown in Scheme 14, aminothiazole-containing cores 14-5 can be synthesized starting<br>
with thiazole-containing core 14-1 wherein P is a suitable amine protecting group such as SEM. The<br>
compound 14-1 can be treated with a metal alkyl such as n-butyllithium to generate the aromatic<br>
anion in situ to which can be added a suitable source of electrophilic halogen such as carbon<br>
tetrabromide to afford the halogenated derivative 14-2. The protecting group P of 14-2 can be<br>
removed by an appropriate method according to the nature of the protecting group to yield product<br><br>
14-3. The compound 14-3 can be reacted with amines 14-4 at elevated temperatures in a suitable<br>
solvent such as DMF to afford the compound of the invention, 14-5.<br><br>
As shown in Scheme 15, pyrrole-containing cores 15-4 can be synthesized starting with N-<br>
protected 4-chloro-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyrimidine 15-1 wherein P is a suitable amine protecting group such<br>
as DEM (diethoxymethyl). The compound 15-1 can be reacted with l-(triisopropylsilyl)pyrrole-3-<br>
boronic acid under Suzuki coupling conditions to afford the simultaneously pyrrole-deprotected core<br>
15-2. Pyrrole-containing compounds 15-2 can be reacted with alkenes 15-3 containing an electron-<br>
withdrawing group Z (such as ‚ÄîCN) in the presence of an appropriate base (such as DBU) at various<br>
temperatures (e.g., between room temperature and 40¬∞ C) followed by an in situ or separate<br>
deprotection step that is suitable for the selected protecting group to afford compounds of the<br>
invention 15-4.<br><br>
As shown in Scheme 16, a substituted pyrazole compound containing a sultone or<br>
sulfoxide functionality as in 16-6 can be prepared by a variety of methods, such as starting<br><br>
with an appropriately substituted bromo thiophenyl ether 16-2. Thioether 16-2 may be<br>
readily prepared by alkylation of the thiophenol 16-1 with an alkyl halide, mesylate or the<br>
like using a base like DBU, potassium carbonate or sodium hydride. The cinnamyl nitrile<br>
16-3 may be prepared by Heck chemistry and the like, using palladium acetate and<br>
triphenylphosphine in DMF at an appropriate temperature with acrylonitrile. The SEM<br>
protected intermediate 16-4 may be prepared by methods previously described for performing<br>
the Michael like addition of the pyrazole core to an appropriately substituted ÔÅ°‚ÄîÔÅ¢ unsaturated<br>
nitrile like 16-3. The sulfoxide 16-5, where n=l, and sulfone 16-5, where n=2, may be<br>
prepared by methods well known in the literature for the oxidation of the thio ether 16-4 like<br>
m-chloroperbenzoic acid (MCPBA) in DCM. The final compounds 16-6, where n= 0, 1 or 2,<br>
may be prepared by methods previously described for the removal of the SEM protecting<br>
group. Alternatively, the sulfur oxidation may be performed on compounds 16-2 or 16-3<br>
depending on the compatibility of the substitution in the synthetic scheme.<br><br>
Also, as shown in Scheme 17, substituted pyrazole compounds containing a sulfonamide<br>
functionality, such as 17-6 can be prepared by a variety of methods. For example, one may start with<br>
an appropriately substituted bromo phenyl sulfonamide 17-2, where Rc and Rd are suitable<br>
substituents. A compound 17-2 may be readily prepared by reaction of the bromo phenyl sulfonyl<br>
chloride 17-1 and an appropriately substituted amine such as an aniline, or a primary or secondary<br>
amine in a suitable solvent such as DCM, THF or pyridine. The cinnamyl nitrile 17-3 may be<br>
prepared by Heck chemistry or the like, using palladium acetate and triphenylphosphine in DMF at an<br><br>
appropriate temperature with acrylonitrile. The final compounds 17-6 where Rc and Rd are part of the<br>
sulfonamide functional group may be prepared by methods analogous to those described in Scheme<br>
16 starting with the cinnamyl nitrile 17-3.<br><br>
Also, as shown in Scheme 18, substituted pyrazole compounds containing an alpha-<br>
allyl cyclopentylmethylene functionality, such as 18-8, can be prepared by, for example,<br>
reacting a pyrazole 18-3, wherein P is a suitable amine protecting group such as SEM and X<br>
is N or C, with a cyclopentylacrylate ester 18-4 to form the ester 18-5. The ester 18-5 may<br>
then be reduced to the corresponding aldehyde, 18-6, for example, by the two-step procedure<br>
of reducing to the alcohol and selectively oxidizing the intermediate alcohol to the aldehyde,<br>
e.g., via a Swern oxidation.. The aldehyde, 18-6, may then be converted to the corresponding<br>
olefin, 18-7, for example by reaction with a Wittig reagent. The olefin 18-7, may then be<br>
deprotected, as described earlier, to produce the formula 18-7 compound. The intermediate,<br>
18-4, may be prepared, for example as shown in Scheme 18, stearting with<br>
cyclopentylaldehyde.<br><br><br>
Also, as shown in Scheme 19, the cyanoguanidine derivative 19-6 can be prepared starting<br>
from substituted pyrazole compounds such as pyrazole 18-3, wherein P is a suitable protecting group<br>
such as SEM and X is N or C. A compound 18-3 may, for example, be reacted with olefin 19-1,<br>
prepared by Horner-Wadsworth Emmons reaction of the corresponding Boc-protected piperidone, in<br>
the presence of a suitable basic catalyst, in a suitable solvent, to form 19-2. The intermediate 19-2 is<br>
deprotected using a suitable deprotection reaction, to provide the amine compound 19-3, which then<br>
reacts selectively with a cyanoimidocarbonate reagent such as 19-4, in a polar solvent at a suitable<br>
temperature, for example, about 20 ¬∞C to give a cyanoimidocarbamate such as 19-5, which can then<br>
be reacted with any of a variety of amines at elevated temperature to give product 19-6.<br><br><br>
The intermediate compounds 20-5 and 20-6 may be prepared by a variety of methods in the<br>
literature, for example, methods such as are outlined in Scheme 20. The intermediate compound 20-3<br>
may be prepared by reaction of the aldehyde compound 20-1 with an appropriately substituted Wittig<br>
reagent or Horner Emmons reagents to give the a-p unsubstituted ester 20-3. Alternatively, 20-3 may<br>
be prepared by a Heck-like reaction with an appropriately substituted aryl bromide 20-2 and an acrylic<br>
ester in the presence of a palladium reagent at elevated temperatures. The compound 20-4 may be<br>
prepared by methods previously described for the Michael-like addition of an appropriately<br>
substituted pyrrole 18-3 on the a-p unsaturated ester compound 20-3. The aldehyde compound 20-5<br>
may be prepared by reduction of the ester compound 20-4 with reagents such as diisobutyl aluminium<br>
hydride at low temperatures such as about -78 ¬∞C in an appropriate solvent. The aldehyde compound<br>
20-5 can be further reduced to the corresponding alcohol compound 20-6 with reagents such as<br>
sodium borohydride in methanol. Alternatively the alcohol compound 20-6 may be prepared directly<br>
by reduction of the ester 20-4 with reagents such as lithium aluminium hydride in appropriate solvent<br>
and at appropriate temperatures.<br><br><br>
The compounds 21-2 and 21-3 may be prepared by using a variety of methods in the<br>
literature, such as, for example, methods outlined in Scheme 21. The olefin compound 21-1 may be<br>
prepared by the reaction of aldehyde compound 20-5 with an appropriately substituted Wittig reagent<br>
or Homer Emmons reagents using a base such as sodium hydride or potassium t-butoxide in an<br>
appropriate solvent and conducted at temperature. The olefin compound compound 21-1 may be<br>
reduced to the saturated compound 21-2, for example, using hydrogenation conditions well known in<br>
the literature, e.g., hydrogen in the presence of palladium on carbon in a solvent such as methanol.<br>
The acetylenic compound 21-3 may be prepared by methods previously described, or by reaction of<br>
the aldehyde 20-5 with Bestmann-Ohira reagent (E. Quesada et al, Tetrahedron, 62 (2006) 6673-<br>
6680) as described in the literature. Alternatively the alcohol compound 20-6 in Scheme 20 may be<br>
oxidized to the aldehyde 20-5 with methods well known in the literature, e.g., Swem oxidation<br>
conditions, followed by reaction with the Bestmann-Ohira reagent, wherein this reaction sequence<br>
may be carried out either as a one pot two-step reaction sequence, or in two separate reaction steps.<br><br><br>
. The compounds 22-1 and 22-3 may be prepared by using a variety of methods in the<br>
literature, for example, via methods outlined in Scheme 22. The oxygen-substituted compound 22-1<br>
may be prepared, for example, by reaction of an appropriately substituted alcohol 20-6 (in Scheme<br>
20), wherein X is N or C, and P is a protecting group, with a base such as sodium hydride and an<br>
appropriate agent such as an alkyl iodide, carbonate, or isocyanate, carried out in a suitable solvent<br>
and at a suitable temperature. Alternatively, the alcohol group on the compound 20-6 may be<br>
converted to a leaving group LG, as in compound 22-2, where the leaving group can be, for example,<br>
bromide or mesylate. The compound 22-2 serves as a substrate for subsequent reaction with a<br>
nucleophile, such as, for example, sodium ethoxide (Nuc = ethoxy).<br><br><br>
It should noted that in all of the Schemes described herein, if there are functional groups<br>
present on a substituent group such as Y, Z, R, R1, R2, R5, etc., further modification can be made if<br>
appropriate and desired. For example, a CN group can be hydrolyzed to afford an amide group; a<br>
carboxylic acid can be converted to a ester, which in turn can be reduced to an alcohol, which in turn<br>
can be further modified. In another example, an OH group can be converted into a better leaving<br>
group such as mesylate, which in turn is suitable for nucleophilic substitution, such as by CN. One<br>
skilled in the art will recognize such further modifications.<br>
Methods<br>
 Compounds of the invention can modulate activity of one or more Janus kinases (JAKs). The<br>
term "modulate" is meant to refer to an ability to increase or decrease the activity of one or more<br>
members of the JAK family of kinases. Accordingly, compounds of the invention can be used in<br>
methods of modulating a JAK by contacting the JAK with any one or more of the compounds or<br>
compositions described herein. In some embodiments, compounds of the present invention can act as<br>
inhibitors of one or more JAKs. In some embodiments, compounds of the present invention can act to<br>
stimulate the activity of one or more JAKs. In further embodiments, the compounds of the invention<br><br>
can be used to modulate activity of a JAK in an individual in need of modulation of the receptor by<br>
administering a modulating amount of a compound of Formula la, Ib, or Ic.<br>
JAKs to which the present compounds bind and/or modulate include any member of the JAK<br>
family. In some embodiments, the JAK is JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 or TYK2. In some embodiments, the<br>
JAK is JAK1 or JAK2. In some embodiments, the JAK is JAK2. In some embodiments, the JAK is<br>
JAK3.<br>
The compounds of the invention can be selective. By "selective" is meant that the compound<br>
binds to or inhibits a JAK with greater affinity or potency, respectively, compared to at least one other<br>
JAK. In some embodiments, the compounds of the invention are selective inhibitors of JAK 1 or JAK2<br>
over JAK3 and/or TYK2. In some embodiments, the compounds of the invention are selective<br>
inhibitors of JAK2 (e.g., over JAK1, JAK3 and TYK2). Without wishing to be bound by theory,<br>
because inhibitors of JAK3 can lead to immunosuppressive effects, a compound which is selective for<br>
JAK2 over JAK3 and which is useful in the treatment of cancer (such as multiple myeloma, for<br>
example) can offer the additional advantage of having fewer immunosuppressive side effects.<br>
Selectivity can be at least about 5-fold, 10-fold, at least about 20-fold, at least about 50-fold, at least<br>
about 100-fold, at least about 200-fold, at least about 500-fold or at least about 1000-fold. Selectivity<br>
can be measured by methods routine in the art. In some embodiments, selectivity can be tested at the<br>
Km of each enzyme. In some embodiments, selectivity of compounds of the invention for JAK2 over<br>
JAK3 can be determined by the cellular ATP concentration.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention pertains to methods of treating a JAK-associated<br>
disease or disorder in an individual (e.g., patient) by administering to the individual in need of such<br>
treatment a therapeutically effective amount or dose of a compound of the present invention or a<br>
pharmaceutical composition thereof. A JAK-associated disease can include any disease, disorder or<br>
condition that is directly or indirectly linked to expression or activity of the JAK, including over-<br>
expression and/or abnormal activity levels. A JAK-associated disease can also include any disease,<br>
disorder or condition that can be prevented, ameliorated, or cured by modulating JAK activity.<br>
Examples of JAK-associated diseases include diseases involving the immune system<br>
including, for example, organ transplant rejection (e.g., allograft rejection and graft versus host<br>
disease).<br>
Further examples of JAK-associated diseases include autoimmune diseases such as multiple<br>
sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile arthritis, type I diabetes, lupus, psoriasis, inflammatory bowel<br>
disease, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, myasthenia gravis, immunoglobulin nephropathies,<br>
autoimmune thyroid disorders, and the like. In some embodiments, the autoimmune disease is an<br>
autoimmune bullous skin disorder such as pemphigus vulgaris (PV) or bullous pemphigoid (BP).<br>
Further examples of JAK-associated diseases include allergic conditions such as asthma, food<br>
allergies, atopic dermatitis and rhinitis. Further examples of JAK-associated diseases include viral<br><br>
diseases such as Epstein Barr Virus (EBV), Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, HIV, HTLV 1, Varicella-Zoster<br>
Virus (VZV) and Human Papilloma Virus (HPV).<br>
Further examples of JAK-associated diseases or conditions include skin disorders such as<br>
psoriasis (for example, psoriasis vulgaris), atopic dermatitis, skin rash, skin irritation, skin<br>
sensitization (e.g., contact dermatitis or allergic contact dermatitis). For example, certain substances<br>
including some Pharmaceuticals when topically applied can cause skin sensitization. In some<br>
embodiments, co-administration or sequential administration of at least one JAK inhibitor of the<br>
invention together with the agent causing unwanted sensitization can be helpful in treating such<br>
unwanted sensitization or dermatitis. In some embodiments, the skin disorder is treated by topical<br>
administration of at least one JAK inhibitor of the invention.<br>
In further embodiments, the JAK-associated disease is cancer including those characterized<br>
by solid tumors (e.g., prostate cancer, renal cancer, hepatic cancer, pancreatic cancer, gastric cancer,<br>
breast cancer, lung cancer, cancers of the head and neck, thyroid cancer, glioblastoma, Kaposi's<br>
sarcoma, Castleman's disease, melanoma etc.), hematological cancers (e.g, lymphoma, leukemia such<br>
as acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or multiple myeloma), and skin cancer such as cutaneous T-cell<br>
lymphoma (CTCL) and cutaneous B-cell lymphoma. Example cutaneous T-cell lymphomas include<br>
Sezary syndrome and mycosis fungoides.<br>
JAK-associated diseases can further include those characterized by expression of a mutant<br>
JAK2 such as those having at least one mutation in the pseudo-kinase domain (e.g., JAK2V617F).<br>
JAK-associated diseases can further include myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs) such as<br>
polycythemia vera (PV)¬ª essential thrombocythemia (ET), myeloid metaplasia with myelofibrosis<br>
(MMM), chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML),<br>
hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES), systemic mast cell disease (SMCD), and the like.<br>
Further JAK-associated diseases include inflammation and inflammatory diseases. Example<br>
inflammatory diseases include inflammatory diseases of the eye (e.g., iritis, uveitis, scleritis,<br>
conjunctivitis, or related disease), inflammatory diseases of the respiratory tract (e.g., the upper<br>
respiratory tract including the nose and sinuses such as rhinitis or sinusitis or the lower respiratory<br>
tract including bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and the like), inflammatory<br>
myopathy such as myocarditis, and other inflammatory diseases.<br>
The JAK inhibitors described herein can further be used to treat ischemia reperfusion injuries<br>
or a disease or condition related to an inflammatory ischemic event such as stroke or cardiac arrest.<br>
The JAK inhibitors described herein can further be used to treat anorexia, cachexia, or fatigue such as<br>
that resulting from or associated with cancer. The JAK inhibitors described herein can further be used<br>
to treat restenosis, sclerodermitis, or fibrosis. The JAK inhibitors described herein can further be used<br>
to treat conditions associated with hypoxia or astrogliosis such as, for example, diabetic retinopathy,<br>
cancer, or neurodegeneration. See, e.g., Dudley, A.C. et al. Biochem. J. 2005, 390(Pt 2):427-36 and<br>
Sriram, K. et al. J. Biol. Ckem. 2004, 279(19):19936-47. Epub 2004 Mar 2.<br><br>
As used herein, the term "contacting" refers to the bringing together of indicated moieties in an<br>
in vitro system or an in vivo system. For example, "contacting" a JAK with a compound of the<br>
invention includes the administration of a compound of the present invention to an individual or<br>
patient, such as a human, having a JAK, as well as, for example, introducing a compound of the<br>
invention into a sample containing a cellular or purified preparation containing the JAK.<br>
As used herein, the term "individual" or "patient," used interchangeably, refers to any animal,<br>
including mammals, preferably mice, rats, other rodents, rabbits, dogs, cats, swine, cattle, sheep,<br>
horses, or primates, and most preferably humans.<br>
As used herein, the phrase "therapeutically effective amount" refers to the amount of active<br>
compound or pharmaceutical agent that elicits the biological or medicinal response in a tissue, system,<br>
animal, individual or human that is being sought by a researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other<br>
clinician, which includes one or more of the following:<br>
(1)	preventing the disease; for example, preventing a disease, condition or disorder in an<br>
individual who may be predisposed to the disease, condition or disorder but does not yet experience or<br>
display the pathology or symptomatology of the disease;<br>
(2)	inhibiting the disease; for example, inhibiting a disease, condition or disorder in an<br>
individual who is experiencing or displaying the pathology or symptomatology of the disease,<br>
condition or disorder {i.e., arresting further development of the pathology and/or symptomatology),<br>
and<br>
(3)	ameliorating the disease; for example, ameliorating a disease, condition or disorder in an<br>
individual who is experiencing or displaying the pathology or symptomatology of the disease,<br>
condition or disorder {i.e., reversing the pathology and/or symptomatology).<br>
Combination Therapies<br>
One or more additional pharmaceutical agents such as, for example, chemotherapeutics, anti-<br>
inflammatory agents, steroids, immunosuppressants, as well as Bcr-Abl, Flt-3, RAF and FAK kinase<br>
inhibitors such as, for example, those described in WO 2006/056399, or other agents can be used in<br>
combination with the compounds of the present invention for treatment of JAK-associated diseases,<br>
disorders or conditions. The one or more additional pharmaceutical agents can be administered to a<br>
patient simultaneously or sequentially.<br>
Example chemotherapeutic include proteosome inhibitors {e.g., bortezomib), thalidomide,<br>
revlimid, and DNA-damaging agents such as melphalan, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine,<br>
etoposide, cannustine, and the like.<br>
Example steroids include coriticosteroids such as dexamethasone or prednisone.<br>

without exacerbation of its toxic effects. Examples of additional pharmaceutical agents used in the<br>
treatment of multiple myeloma, for example, can include, without- limitation, melphalan, melphalan<br>
plus prednisone [MP], doxorubicin, dexamethasone, and Velcade (bortezomib). Further additional<br>
agents used in the treatment of multiple myeloma include Bcr-Abl, Flt-3, RAF and FAK kinase<br>
inhibitors. Additive or synergistic effects are desirable outcomes of combining a JAK inhibitor of the<br>
present invention with an additional agent. Furthermore, resistance of multiple myeloma cells to<br>
agents such as dexamethasone may be reversible upon treatment with a JAK inhibitor of the present<br>
invention. The agents can be combined with the present compounds in a single or continuous dosage<br>
form, or the agents can be administered simultaneously or sequentially as separate dosage forms.<br>
In some embodiments, a corticosteroid such as dexamethasone is administered to a patient in<br>
combination with at least one JAK inhibitor where the dexamethasone is administered intermittently<br>
as opposed to continuously.<br>
In some further embodiments, combinations of one or more JAK inhibitors of the invention<br>
with other therapeutic agents can be administered to a patient prior to, during, and/or after a bone<br>
marrow transplant or stem cell transplant.<br>
Pharmaceutical Formulations and Dosage Forms<br>
When employed as Pharmaceuticals, the compounds of the invention can be administered in<br>
the form of pharmaceutical compositions. These compositions can be prepared in a manner well<br>
known in the pharmaceutical art, and can be administered by a variety of routes, depending upon<br>
whether local or systemic treatment is desired and upon the area to be treated. Administration may be<br>
topical (including transdermal, epidermal, ophthalmic and to mucous membranes including intranasal,<br>
vaginal and rectal delivery), pulmonary (e.g., by inhalation or insufflation of powders or aerosols,<br>
including by nebulizer; intratracheal or intranasal), oral or parenteral. Parenteral administration<br>
includes intravenous, intraarterial, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal intramuscular or injection or<br>
infusion; or intracranial, e.g., intrathecal or intraventricular, administration. Parenteral administration<br>
can be in the form of a single bolus dose, or may be, for example, by a continuous perfusion pump.<br><br>
Pharmaceutical compositions and formulations for topical administration may include transdermal<br>
patches, ointments, lotions, creams, gels, drops, suppositories, sprays, liquids and powders.<br>
Conventional pharmaceutical carriers, aqueous, powder or oily bases, thickeners and the like may be<br>
"i<br>
necessary or desirable. Coated condoms, gloves and the like may also be useful.<br>
This invention also includes pharmaceutical compositions which contain, as the active<br>
ingredient, one or more of the compounds of the invention above in combination with one or more<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carriers (excipients). In making the compositions of the invention, the<br>
active ingredient is typically mixed with an excipient, diluted by an excipient or enclosed within such<br>
a carrier in the form of, for example, a capsule, sachet, paper, or other container. When the excipient<br>
serves as a diluent, it can be a solid, semi-solid, or liquid material, which acts as a vehicle, carrier or<br>
medium for the active ingredient. Thus, the compositions can be in the form of tablets, pills, powders,<br>
lozenges, sachets, cachets, elixirs, suspensions, emulsions, solutions, syrups, aerosols (as a solid or in<br>
a liquid medium), ointments containing, for example, up to 10% by weight of the active compound,<br>
soft and hard gelatin capsules, suppositories, sterile injectable solutions, and sterile packaged<br>
powders.<br>
In preparing a formulation, the active compound can be milled to provide the appropriate<br>
particle size prior to combining with the other ingredients. If the active compound is substantially<br>
insoluble, it can be milled to a particle size of less than 200 mesh. If the active compound is<br>
substantially water soluble, the particle size can be adjusted by milling to provide a substantially<br>
uniform distribution in the formulation, e.g. about 40 mesh.<br>
Some examples of suitable excipients include lactose, dextrose, sucrose, sorbitol, mannitol,<br>
starches, gum acacia, calcium phosphate, alginates, tragacanth, gelatin, calcium silicate,<br>
microcrystalline cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, cellulose, water, syrup, and methyl cellulose. The<br>
formulations can additionally include: lubricating agents such as talc, magnesium stearate, and<br>
mineral oil; wetting agents; emulsifying and suspending agents; preserving agents such as methyl- and<br>
propylhydroxy-benzoates; sweetening agents; and flavoring agents. The compositions of the invention<br>
can be formulated so as to provide quick, sustained or delayed release of the active ingredient after<br>
administration to the patient by employing procedures known in the art.<br>
The compositions can be formulated in a unit dosage form, each dosage containing from<br>
about 5 to about 1000 mg (1 g), more usually about 100 to about 500 mg, of the active ingredient. The<br>
term "unit dosage forms" refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages for human<br>
subjects and other mammals, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active material<br>
calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect, in association with a suitable pharmaceutical<br>
excipient.<br>
The active compound can be effective over a wide dosage range and is generally administered<br>
in a pharmaceutically effective amount. It will be understood, however, that the amount of the<br>
compound actually administered will usually be determined by a physician, according to the relevant<br><br>
circumstances, including the condition to be treated, the chosen route of administration, the actual<br>
compound administered, the age, weight, and response of the individual patient, the severity of the<br>
patient's symptoms, and the like.<br>
For preparing solid compositions such as tablets, the principal active ingredient is mixed with<br>
a pharmaceutical excipient to form a solid preformulation composition containing a homogeneous<br>
mixture of a compound of the present invention. When referring to these preformulation compositions<br>
as homogeneous, the active ingredient is typically dispersed evenly throughout the composition so<br>
that the composition can be readily subdivided into equally effective unit dosage forms such as<br>
tablets, pills and capsules. This solid preformulation is then subdivided into unit dosage forms of the<br>
type described above containing from, for example, about 0.1 to about 1000 mg of the active<br>
ingredient of the present invention.<br>
The tablets or pills of the present invention can be coated or otherwise compounded to<br>
provide a dosage form affording the advantage of prolonged action. For example, the tablet or pill can<br>
comprise an inner dosage and an outer dosage component, the latter being in the form of an envelope<br>
over the former. The two components can be separated by an enteric layer which serves to resist<br>
disintegration in the stomach and permit the inner component to pass intact into the duodenum or to<br>
be delayed in release. A variety of materials can be used for such enteric layers or coatings, such<br>
materials including a number of polymeric acids and mixtures of polymeric acids with such materials<br>
as shellac, cetyl alcohol, and cellulose acetate.<br>
The liquid forms in which the compounds and compositions of the present invention can be<br>
incorporated for administration orally or by injection include aqueous solutions, suitably flavored<br>
syrups, aqueous or oil suspensions, and flavored emulsions with edible oils such as cottonseed oil,<br>
sesame oil, coconut oil, or peanut oil, as well as elixirs and similar pharmaceutical vehicles.<br>
Compositions for inhalation or insufflation include solutions and suspensions in<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable, aqueous or organic solvents, or mixtures thereof, and powders. The<br>
liquid or solid compositions may contain suitable pharmaceutically acceptable excipients as described<br>
supra. In some embodiments, the compositions are administered by the oral or nasal respiratory route<br>
for local or systemic effect. Compositions in can be nebulized by use of inert gases. Nebulized<br>
solutions may be breathed directly from the nebulizing device or the nebulizing device can be<br>
attached to a face masks tent, or intermittent positive pressure breathing machine. Solution,<br>
suspension, or powder compositions can be administered orally or nasally from devices which deliver<br>
the formulation in an appropriate manner.<br>
The amount of compound or composition administered to a patient will vary depending upon<br>
what is being administered, the purpose of the administration, such as prophylaxis or therapy, the state<br>
of the patient, the manner of administration, and the like. In therapeutic applications, compositions<br>
can be administered to a patient already suffering from a disease in an amount sufficient to cure or at<br>
least partially arrest the symptoms of the disease and its complications. Effective doses will depend on<br><br>
the disease condition being treated as well as by the judgment of the attending clinician depending<br>
upon factors such as the severity of the disease, the age, weight and general condition of the patient,<br>
and the like.<br>
The compositions administered to a patient can be in the form of pharmaceutical<br>
compositions described above. These compositions can be sterilized by conventional sterilization<br>
techniques, or may be sterile filtered. Aqueous solutions can be packaged for use as is, or lyophilized,<br>
the lyophilized preparation being combined with a sterile aqueous carrier prior to administration. The<br>
pH of the compound preparations typically will be between 3 and 11, more preferably from 5 to 9 and<br>
most preferably from 7 to 8. It will be understood that use of certain of the foregoing excipients,<br>
carriers, or stabilizers will result in the formation of pharmaceutical salts.<br>
The therapeutic dosage of the compounds of the present invention can vary according to, for<br>
example, the particular use for which the treatment is made, the manner of administration of the<br>
compound, the health and condition of the patient, and the judgment of the prescribing physician. The<br>
proportion or concentration of a compound of the invention in a pharmaceutical composition can vary<br>
depending upon a number of factors including dosage, chemical characteristics (e.g., hydrophobicity),<br>
and the route of administration. For example, the compounds of the invention can be provided in an<br>
aqueous physiological buffer solution containing about 0.1 to about 10% w/v of the compound for<br>
parenteral administration. Some typical dose ranges are from about 1 jag/kg to about 1 g/kg of body<br>
weight per day. In some embodiments, the dose range is from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 100 mg/kg<br>
of body weight per day. The dosage is likely to depend on such variables as the type and extent of<br>
progression of the disease or disorder, the overall health status of the particular patient, the relative<br>
biological efficacy of the compound selected, formulation of the excipient, and its route of<br>
administration. Effective doses can be extrapolated from dose-response curves derived from in vitro<br>
or animal model test systems.<br>
The compositions of the invention can further include one or more additional pharmaceutical<br>
agents such as a chemotherapeutic, steroid, anti-inflammatory compound, or immunosuppressant,<br>
examples of which are listed hereinabove.<br>
Labeled Compounds and Assay Methods<br>
Another aspect of the present invention relates to labeled compounds of the invention (radio-<br>
labeled, fluorescent-labeled, etc.) that would be useful not only in imaging techniques but also in<br>
assays, both in vitro and in vivo, for localizing and quantitating JAK in tissue samples, including<br>
human, and for identifying JAK ligands by inhibition binding of a labeled compound. Accordingly,<br>
the present invention includes JAK assays that contain such labeled compounds.<br>
The present invention further includes isotopically-labeled compounds of the invention. An<br>
"isotopically" or "radio-labeled" compound is a compound of the invention where one or more atoms<br>
are replaced or substituted by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the<br><br>
atomic mass or mass number typically found in nature (i.e., naturally occurring). Suitable<br>
radionuclides that may be incorporated in compounds of the present invention include but are not<br>
limited to 2H (also written as D for deuterium), 3H (also written as T for tritium), "C, 13C, 14C, 13N,<br>
15N, I5O, 17O, 18O, I8F, 35S, 36C1, 82Br, 75Br, 76Br, 77Br, 123I, 124I, 125I and I31I. The radionuclide that is<br>
incorporated in the instant radio-labeled compounds will depend on the specific application of that<br>
radio-labeled compound. For example, for in vitro metalloprotease labeling and competition assays,<br>
compounds that incorporate 3H, 14C, 82Br, I25I, I31I, 35S or will generally be most useful. For radio-<br>
imaging applications nC, 18F, I25I, I23I, I241,1311,75Br, 76Br or 77Br will generally be most useful.<br>
It is understood that a "radio-labeled " or "labeled compound" is a compound that has<br>
incorporated at least one radionuclide. In some embodiments the radionuclide is selected from the<br>
group consisting of 3H, I4C, 1251,35S and 82Br.<br>
The present invention can further include synthetic methods for incorporating radio-isotopes<br>
into compounds of the invention. Synthetic methods for incorporating radio-isotopes into organic<br>
compounds are well known in the art, and an ordinary skill in the art will readily recognize the<br>
methods applicable for the compounds of invention.<br>
A labeled compound of the invention can be used in a screening assay to identify/evaluate<br>
compounds. For example, a newly synthesized or identified compound (i.e., test compound) which is<br>
labeled can be evaluated for its ability to bind a JAK by monitoring its concentration variation when<br>
contacting with the JAK, through tracking of the labeling. For example, a test compound (labeled)<br>
can be evaluated for its ability to reduce binding of smother compound which is known to bind to a<br>
JAK (i.e., standard compound). Accordingly, the ability of a test compound to compete with the<br>
standard compound for binding to the JAK directly correlates to its binding affinity. Conversely, in<br>
some other screening assays, the standard compound is labeled and test compounds are unlabeled.<br>
Accordingly, the concentration of the labeled standard compound is monitored in order to evaluate the<br>
competition between the standard compound and the test compound, and the relative binding affinity<br>
of the test compound is thus ascertained.<br>
Kits<br>
The present invention also includes pharmaceutical kits useful, for example, in the treatment<br>
or prevention of JAK-associated diseases or disorders, such as cancer, which include one or more<br>
containers containing a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of<br>
a compound of the invention. Such kits can further include, if desired, one or more of various<br>
conventional pharmaceutical kit components, such as, for example, containers with one or more<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, additional containers, etc., as will be readily apparent to those<br>
skilled in the art. Instructions, either as inserts or as labels, indicating quantities of the components to<br>
be administered, guidelines for administration, and/or guidelines for mixing the components, can also<br>
be included in the kit.<br><br>
The invention will be described in greater detail by way of specific examples. The following<br>
examples are offered for illustrative purposes, and are not intended to limit the invention in any<br>
manner. Those of skill in the art will readily recognize a variety of noncritical parameters which can<br>
be changed or modified to yield essentially the same results. The compounds of the Examples<br>
have been found to be JAK inhibitors according to at least one assay described herein.<br><br>

Example A: In vitro JAK Kinase Assay<br>
Compounds herein were tested for inhibitory activity of JAK targets according to the<br>
following in vitro assay described in Park et al., Analytical Biochemistry 1999, 269, 94-104. The<br>
catalytic domains of human JAK1 (a.a. 837-1142), Jak2 (a.a. 828-1132) and Jak3 (a.a. 781-1124) with<br>
an N-terminal His tag were expressed using baculovirus in insect cells and purified. The catalytic<br>
activity of JAK1, JAK2 or JAK3 was assayed by measuring the phosphorylation of a biotinylated<br>
peptide. The phosphorylated peptide was detected by homogenous time resolved fluorescence<br>
(HTRF). IC30s of compounds were measured for each kinase in the reactions that contain the enzyme,<br>
ATP and 500 nM peptide in 50 mM Tris (pH 7.8) buffer with 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT, and 0.1<br>
ÔÅ≠g/mL (0.01%) BSA. The ATP concentration in the reactions was 90 ÔÅ≠M for Jakl, 30 ÔÅ≠M for Jak2<br>
and 3 ÔÅ≠M for Jak3. Reactions were carried out at room temperature for 1 hr and then stopped with 20<br>
(ÔÅ≠L 45 mM EDTA, 300 nM SA-APC, 6 nM Eu-Py20 in assay buffer (Perkin Elmer, Boston, MA).<br>
Binding to the Europium labeled antibody took place for 40 minutes and HTRF signal was measured<br>
on a Fusion plate reader (Perkin Elmer, Boston, MA). Compounds having an ICS0 of 10 uM or less for<br>
any of the above-mentioned JAK targets were considered active.<br>
Example B: Cellular Assays<br>
One or more compounds herein were tested for inhibitory activity of JAK targets according to<br>
at least one of the following cellular assays.<br>
Cancer cell lines dependent on cytokines and hence JAK/STAT signal transduction, for<br>
growth, were plated at 6000 cells per well (96 well plate format) in RPMI 1640, 10% FBS, and 1<br>
nG/mL of appropriate cytokine. Compounds were added to the cells in DMSO/media (final<br>
concentration 0.2% DMSO) and incubated for 72 hours at 37 ¬∞C, 5% CO2- The effect of compound<br>
on cell viability was assessed using the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega)<br><br>
followed by TopCount (Perkin Elmer, Boston, MA) quantitation. Potential off-target effects of<br>
compounds were measured in parallel using a non-JAK driven cell line with the same assay readout.<br>
Compounds having an IC50 of 10 uM or less with selectivity for JAK driven proliferation were<br>
considered active. All experiments were performed in duplicate.<br>
The above cell lines can also be used to examine the effects of compounds on<br>
phosphorylation of JAK kinases or potential downstream substrates such as STAT proteins, Akt,<br>
Shp2, or Erk. These experiments can be performed following an overnight cytokine starvation,<br>
followed by a brief preincubation with compound (2 hours or less) and cytokine stimulation of<br>
approximately 1 hour or less. Proteins are then extracted from cells and analyzed by techniques<br>
familiar to those schooled in the art including Western blotting or ELISAs using antibodies that can<br>
differentiate between phosphorylated and total protein. These experiments can utilize normal or<br>
cancer cells to investigate the activity of compounds on tumor cell survival biology or on mediators of<br>
inflammatory disease. For example, with regards to the latter, cytokines such as IL-6, IL-12, JL-23,<br>
or IFN can be used to stimulate JAK activation resulting in phosphorylation of STAT protein(s) and<br>
potentially in transcriptional profiles (assessed by array or qPCR technology) or production and/or<br>
secretion of proteins, such as IL-17. The ability of compounds to inhibit these cytokine mediated<br>
effects can be measured using techniques common to those schooled in the art.<br>
Compounds herein can also be tested in cellular models designed to evaluate their potency<br>
and activity against mutant JAKs, for example, the JAK2V617F mutation found in myeloid<br>
proliferative disorders. These experiments often utilize cytokine dependent cells of hematological<br>
lineage (e.g. BaF/3) into which the wild-type or mutant JAK kinases are ectopically expressed (James,<br>
C, et al. Nature 434:1144-1148; Staerk, J., et al. JBC 280:41893-41899). Endpoints include the<br>
effects of compounds on cell survival, proliferation, and phosphorylated JAK, STAT, Akt, or Erk<br>
proteins.<br>
Certain compounds herein have been or can be evaluated for their activity inhibiting T-cell<br>
proliferation. Such as assay can be considered a second cytokine (i.e. JAK) driven proliferation assay<br>
and also a simplistic assay of immune suppression or inhibition of immune activation. The following<br>
is a brief outline of how such experiments can be performed. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells<br>
(PBMCs) are prepared from human whole blood samples using Ficoll Hypaque separation method<br>
and T-cells (traction 2000) can be obtained from PBMCs by elutriation. Freshly isolated human T-<br>
cells can be maintained in culture medium (RPMI 1640 supplemented withl0% fetal bovine serum,<br>
100 U/ml penicillin, 100 fig/ml streptomycin) at a density of 2 x 10s cells/ml at 37 "C for up to 2 days.<br>
For IL-2 stimulated cell proliferation analysis, T-cells are first treated with Phytohemagglutinin<br>
(PHA) at a final concentration of 10 ug/mL for 72h. After washing once with PBS, 6000 cells/well are<br>
plated in 96-well plates and treated with compounds at different concentrations in the culture medium<br>
in the presence of 100 U/mL human EL-2 (ProSpec-Tany TechnoGene; Rehovot, Israel). The plates<br><br>
are incubated at 37 ¬∞C for 72h and the proliferation index is assessed using CellTiter-Glo Luminescent<br>
reagents following the manufactory suggested protocol (Promega; Madison, WT).<br>
Example C: In vivo anti-tumor efficacy<br>
Compounds herein can be evaluated in human tumor xenograft models in immune<br>
compromised mice. For example, a tumorigenic variant of the INA-6 plasmacytoma cell line can be<br>
used to inoculate SCBD mice subcutaneously (Burger, R., et al. Hematol J. 2:42-53, 2001). Tumor<br>
bearing animals can then be randomized into drug or vehicle treatment groups and different doses of<br>
compounds can be administered by any number of the usual routes including oral, i.p., or continuous<br>
infusion using implantable pumps. Tumor growth is followed over time using calipers. Further,<br>
tumor samples can be harvested at any time after the initiation of treatment for analysis as described<br>
above (Example B) to evaluate compound effects on JAK activity and downstream signaling<br>
pathways. In addition, selectivity of the compound(s) can be assessed using xenograft tumor models<br>
that are driven by other know kinases (e.g. Bcr-Abl) such as the K562 tumor model.<br>
Example D: Murine Skin Contact Delayed Hypersensitivity Response Test<br>
Compounds herein can also be tested for their efficacies (of inhibiting JAK targets) in the T-<br>
cell driven murine delayed hypersensitivity test model. The murine skin contact delayed-type<br>
hypersensitivity (DTH) response is considered to be a valid model of clinical contact dermatitis, and<br>
other T-lymphocyte mediated immune disorders of the skin, such as psoriasis (Immunol Today. 1998<br>
Jan;19(l):37-44). Murine DTH shares multiple characteristics with psoriasis, including the immune<br>
infiltrate, the accompanying increase in inflammatory cytokines, and keratinocyte hyperproliferation.<br>
Furthermore, many classes of agents that are efficacious in treating psoriasis in the clinic are also<br>
effective inhibitors of the DTH response in mice (Agents Actions. 1993 Jan;38(l-2):116-21).<br>
On Day 0 and 1, Balb/c mice are sensitized with a topical application, to their shaved<br>
abdomen with the antigen 2,4,dinitro-fluorobenzene (DNFB). On day 5, ears are measured for<br>
thickness using an engineer's micrometer. This measurement is recorded and used as a baseline. Both<br>
of the animals' ears are then challenged by a topical application of DNFB in a total of 20 ÔÅ≠L (10 ÔÅ≠L<br>
on the internal pinna and 10 ÔÅ≠L on the external pinna) at a concentration of 0.2%. Twenty-four to<br>
seventy-two hours after the challenge, ears are measured again. Treatment with the test compounds<br>
was given throughout the sensitization and challenge phases (day -1 to day 7) or prior to and<br>
throughout the challenge phase (usually afternoon of day 4 to day 7). Treatment of the test<br>
compounds (in different concentration) was administered either systemically or topically (topical<br>
application of the treatment to the ears). Efficacies of the test compounds are indicated by a reduction<br>
in ear swelling comparing to the situation without the treatment. Compounds causing a reduction of<br>
20% or more were considered efficacious. In some experiments, the mice are challenged but not<br>
sensitized (negative control).<br><br>
The inhibitive effect (inhibiting activation of the JAK-STAT pathways) of the test compounds<br>
can be confirmed by immunohistochemical analysis. Activation of the JAK-STAT pathway(s) results<br>
in the formation and translocation of functional transcription factors. Further, the influx of immune<br>
cells and the increased proliferation of keratinocytes should also provide unique expression profile<br>
changes in the ear that can be investigated and quantified. Formalin fixed and paraffin embedded ear<br>
sections (harvested after the challenge phase in the DTH model) are subjected to<br>
immunohistochemical analysis using an antibody that specifically interacts with phosphorylated<br>
STAT3 (clone 58E12, Cell Signaling Technologies). The mouse ears are treated with test<br>
compounds, vehicle, or dexamethasone (a clinically efficacious treatment for psoriasis), or without<br>
any treatment, in the DTH model for comparisons. Test compounds and the dexamethasone can<br>
produce similar transcriptional changes both qualitatively and quantitatively, and both the test<br>
compounds and dexamethasone can reduce the number of infiltrating cells. Both systemically and<br>
topical administration of the test compounds can produce inhibitive effects, i.e., reduction in the<br>
number of infiltrating cells and inhibition of the transcriptional changes.<br>
Example ¬£: In vivo anti-inflammatory activity<br>
Compounds herein can be or have been evaluated in rodent or non-rodent models designed to<br>
replicate a single or complex inflammation response. For instance, rodent models of arthritis can be<br>
used to evaluate the therapeutic potential of compounds dosed preventatively or therapeutically.<br>
These models include but are not limited to mouse or rat collagen-induced arthritis, rat adjuvant-<br>
induced arthritis, and collagen antibody-induced arthritis. Autoimmune diseases including, but not<br>
limited to, multiple sclerosis, type I-diabetes mellitus, uveoretinitis, thyroditis, myasthenia gravis,<br>
immunoglobulin nephropathies, myocarditis, airway sensitization (asthma), lupus, or colitis may also<br>
be used to evaluate the therapeutic potential of compounds herein. These models are well established<br>
in the research community and are familiar to those schooled in the art (Current Protocols in<br>
