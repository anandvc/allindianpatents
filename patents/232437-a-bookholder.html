Hereinafter, preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail referring to the accompanying drawings. Prior to the description, it should be un derstood that the terms used in the specification and appended claims should not be cons<br>
trued as limited to general and dictionary meanings, but interpreted based on the meanin<br><br>
gs and concepts corresponding to technical aspects of the present invention on the basis of the principle that the inventor is allowed to define terms appropriately for the best ex planation. Therefore, the description proposed herein is just a preferable example for t he purpose of illustrations only, not intended to limit the scope of the invention, so it sh ould be understood that other equivalents and modifications could be made thereto with out departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
FIG. 1 is a perspective view schematically showing a bookholder according to an embodiment of the present invention.   Referring to FIG. I, the bookholder of this emb odiment includes a pair of cover members 100 and 200, and a supporting unit 500 install ed between the cover members 100 and 200.<br>
One end of each cover member 100 or 200 is combined to the supporting unit 50 0, and the cover members 100 and 200 may be folded each other about the supporting u nit 500 to thereby form an inner space for receiving a book therein.<br>
Each cover member 100 or 200 has a sidewall 102 and 202 protruding a predeter mined height on the edge. When the cover members 100 and 200 are folded, the sidew alls 102 and 202 form the inner space for receiving a book together with the supporting unit 500. That is to say, the sidewall 102 or 202 has a height matched to a half width o f the supporting unit 500, so the sidewalls 102 and 202 contact each other along the cent er line of the supporting unit 500 forming an inner space when the cover members 100 a nd 200 are folded.<br>
On the inner surface of the cover member 100 or 200 where a book is received, a<br>
support plate 110 or 210 for supporting a front or rear book cover in contact is installed<br>
. Specifically, a recess 115 or 215 is formed in the inner surface of the cover member 10<br>
0 or 200 so that the support plate 110 or 210 may be rotated into the recess 115 or 215.<br>
The support plate 110 or 210 is configured to have size and thickness suitable for supp<br><br>
orting general books.<br>
Preferably, the support plate 1 10 or 210 is hinged to the cover member 100 or 20 0 so that it may be pivoted about the supporting unit 500. In addition, between the sup port plate 110 or 210 and a bottom of the recess 115 or 215 or at the hinged portion, an e lastic member 112 or 212 such as a spring, a coil spring or a leaf spring may be provided to elastically and upwardly bias a book supported thereon. Alternatively, the support plate 110 or 210 may be installed on either of the cover members 100 and 200.<br>
A clamping means 120 for fixing the received book is provided to the upper and/ or lower end of the inner space of the cover members. Preferably, the clamping means 120 biases the upper and lower portion of the book in order to prevent unintentional turn over of the pages or movement of the book during reading.<br>
The clamping means 120 includes a clamp 130 for suppressing the pages of the b ook and a guide member 140 for moving the clamp 130 in a horizontal direction.<br>
Specifically, as shown in an enlarged view in a circle of FIG. 1, the clamp 130 in eludes a body 131 combined to the guide member 140 so as to be movable horizontally or widthwise with respect to the book, and a protrusion pressing unit 132 whose one end is pivotally combined to a front end of the body 131 to bias the pages of the book. Pre ferably, the protrusion pressing unit 132 is combined to the body 131 so as to be elastica lly pivotal by means of an elastic member 134. Thus, when a user pushes a page of the book down with pressing the protrusion pressing unit 132 in order to read the next page, the page is inserted with pivoting the protrusion pressing unit 132. The protrusion press ing unit 132 is then restored to its original position due to the elastic member, thereby fi xing the page below it.<br>
The clamp 130 can move along the guide member 140 so that a fixed portion oft<br>
he page may be selected.    For this purpose, a toothed member 141 for fixing a position<br><br>
of the clamp 130 is provided on the guide member 140. and an elastic protrusion 331 (se e FIG. 3) of the clamp 130 is joined to a selected position of the toothed member 141. A s a result, a position for fixing the page of the book may be determined by moving the cl amp 130 in a horizontal direction and then positioning it at a certain position of the toot hed member 141.   At this time, an adjustment surface 13la having a rough face may be<br>
provided on the upper surface of the body 131 in order to facilitate position adjustment of the clamp 130. Such a position determining means is not limited to this embodimen t, but it should be understood that various modifications may be applied thereto with the<br>
use of well-known techniques.<br>
Preferably, according to this embodiment, the guide member 140 may be configu red to be movable in the vertical direction and lengthwise with respect to the book. Sp ecifically, a vertical guide 142 having teeth is formed on the inner side of the cover mem ber 100 or 200, and an elastic protrusion (not shown) corresponding to the teeth is forme d on the guide member 140 so that the elastic protrusion is engaged at the selected positi on of the vertical guide 142. Thus, a user may set a vertical position of the guide mem ber 140 according to size of the book.<br>
On the inner side of the cover members 100 and 200, protrusions 150 for placing<br>
a pen or pencil may be provided. The protrusions 150 are spaced a predetermined dist ance so that the pen or pencil may be fit therebetween.   In addition, it is also possible to<br>
form a receiving space in a bottom portion of the cover member 100 or 200, and then i<br>
nstall a cover 160 (see FIG. 5) so that writing tools or scratch papers may be stored there<br>
in.<br>
In addition, the cover members 100 and 200 may have an illuminating unit 170 f<br>
or allowing a user to read the book in the dark.   Preferably, the illuminating unit 170 is<br>
formed in one or both of the sidewalls of the cover members 100 and 200, and received i<br><br>
n an insertion groove 104 so as not to obstruct opening or closing the cover members 10 0 and 200.<br>
Specifically, the illuminating unit 170 includes a rotating member 172 of which one end is hinged so as to be pivotal at the insertion groove 104, and a lamp body 174 of<br>
which a center portion is rotatably hinged to the other end of the rotating member 172.<br>
The lamp body 174 has lamps 176 at both ends, and the lamps 176 may be rotated abou t the lamp body 174 so as to adjust an angle of the illumination.<br>
In addition, a power source 178 for supplying power to the illuminating unit 170 is provided to the cover member 100 and/or 200. The power source 178 is installed in t he sidewall adjacent to the illuminating unit 170. and preferably adopts a battery so as to<br>
ensure power supply while the bookholder is carried.<br>
According to this embodiment, a locking unit I 80 is also provided on the bookh older in order to keep the cover members 100 and 200 unfold. Preferably, the locking unit 180 includes at least one bar 182 on the upper or lower end of one of both sidewalls<br>
102 and 202 of the cover members 100 and 200, and a hook groove 184 formed in the other one of the sidewalls 102 and 202 of the cover members 100 and 200 so that a Ieadi ng end of the bar 182 may be inserted into the hook groove 184 when the cover member s 100 and 200 are open. In order to insert the bar 182 into the hook groove 184, aswitc h 186 combined to one end of the bar 182 and exposed outward is used to push the bar 1 82 toward the other sidewall having the hook groove 184. At this time, it is desirable t hat a protrusion 182a is formed on the end of the bar 182 and a groove (not shown) to be<br>
engaged with the protrusion 182a is formed on the end of the hook groove 184 so that t<br>
he inserted bar 182 is not easily taken off the hook groove 184.<br>
FIG. 2 is a perspective view schematically showing a bookholder according to an<br>
other embodiment of the present invention.   The following description will be focused<br><br>
on different parts to the former embodiment.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, the bookholder of this embodiment has a pair of cover mem bers 300 and 400, which are folded about a supporting unit 500 interposed therebetween to form an inner space for receiving a book.<br>
The bookholder of this embodiment does not have a sidewall, differently from th e former embodiment. Instead, a clamp 330 and a string 510 installed in the inner side of the supporting unit suppress the book so that the book received between the cover me mbers 300 and 400 and the supporting unit 500 is not loosened or deviated.<br>
On the inner sides of the cover member 300 or 400 in which the book is received , a support plate 310 or 410 for supporting the book upward in contact with a book cove r is formed in a recess 315 or 415. Preferably, the support plate 310 or 410 includes as upport body 320 or 420. and width and length extension units 326, 328 or 426, 428 resp ectively connected on one side of the support body 320 or 420 by a rail 325 or 425 and s electively extendable so as to adjust its width and length according to the size of the boo k. One end ofthe width extension unit 326 or426 is hinged to the recess 315 or415 so as to be pivotal on the supporting unit 500.<br>
The support body 320 has a flat portion 322 and an inclined portion 324.   The fl<br>
at portion 322 contacts with the book received in the cover members 300 and 400 togeth<br>
er with the clamp 330, thereby fixing the book more firmly rather than an inclined state.<br>
For this purpose, the flat portion 322 is pivoted on the inclined portion 324 by means<br>
of a hinge 323 interposed between the flat portion 322 and the inclined portion 324, and<br>
supported by a support 324a provided at the lower end ofthe inclined portion 324, as sh<br>
own in an enlarged view depicted in a circle of FIG. 2.   At this time, the flat portion 32<br>
2 may be elastically pivoted using a spring, not shown.    If the support plate 310 is not i<br>
n use, the flat portion 322 is received in the recess 315 or 415 in parallel with the incline<br><br>
d portion 324.   At this time, the support plate which is biased upward by an elastic mea ns (not shown) is locked with a hooking member 329 of the cover member 300 or 400.<br>
According to this embodiment, the cover member 300 or 400 has the clamp 330 on its inner side in order to fix the pages of the received book. The clamp 330 is install ed to give a pressing force opposite to a biasing direction of the support plate 310 or 410.<br>
FIGs. 3 and 4 are perspective view and sectional view showing the clamp 330 of this embodiment. Referring to FIGs. 3 and 4, the clamp 330 has a lifting unit for select ively extending its length according to a thickness of the book. The lifting unit has a fir st block 332, and a second block 334 in which the first block 332 selectively moves up a nd down.<br>
Specifically, the first block 332 includes an elastic hook 336 which has a hookin g protrusion 336a at one side, and a release protrusion 336b adjacent to the hooking prot rusion 336a.<br>
In addition, the second block 334 has a guide slot 337 on its one sidewall, and te eth 338 formed along the inner sidewall of the second block 334.<br>
Thus, when the first block 332 is inserted into the second block 334 downward with a spring 339 interposed therebetween, the hooking protrusion 336a of the elastic ho ok 336 descends along the teeth 338 by means of its own elastic force, and then when th e first block 332 is stopped at a desired position, the hooking protrusion 336a of the elas tic hook 336 is locked with the teeth 338 to be maintained its position.<br>
In this state, when the release protrusion 336b is pressed by finger in order to asc end the clamp 330. the hooking protrusion 336a is released from the teeth 338. Then, t he first block 332 is ascended by the spring 339.<br>
Here, the lifting unit, or the clamp 330, is not limited to this embodiment, but ot<br>
her techniques well known in the art may be applied thereto.<br><br>
In addition, the elastic protrusion 331 prepared in the second block 334 as shown in FIG. 3 is selectively combined with the toothed member 141 of the guide member 1 40 described in the first embodiment.    In addition, a guide protrusion 333 prevents the clamp 330 from leaving the guide member 140.<br>
According to the present embodiment, an illuminating unit 340 is detachably inst ailed at one or both sides of the cover members 300 and 400. This illuminating unit 34 0 is identical to the illuminating unit 170 of the previous embodiment, and not described in detail here. In addition, a support piece 350 for supporting the pages of the receive d book is provided on the cover members 300 and 400. In case that the book received i n the cover members 300 and 400 is supported only by the clamp 330, the book is likely to pop out the bookholder when it is turned over. However, if the support piece 350 m ade of transparent material connects the opposite clamps 330 in the cover members 300 and 400, the book may be kept its position well, allowing a user to read the book.<br>
According to this embodiment, the supporting unit 500 has a string 510 to keep t he book received in the cover members 300 and 400 from falling off the bookholder wh en the bookholder is turned over. The string 510 is preferably made of elastic materials . Preferably, the string 510 may be received in a slit 520 formed in the supporting unit 500 lengthwise so as to press the center line of the open book.<br>
Preferably, one end of the string 510 is fixed to the supporting unit, and the other end is fixed to a position fixing unit 530 which is provided on the supporting unit so as to adjust a length of the string 510 according to the size of the book.<br>
Specifically, the position fixing unit 530 is configured as follows.   A rectangula<br>
r position fixing groove 512 is formed in one end of the supporting unit 500.   Two stag<br>
es of toothed members 514 for position fixing are longitudinally formed on at least one<br>
of the inner walls of the position fixing groove 512.<br><br>
A position fixing pin 532 connected to the other end of the string 510 is selective ly combined with the position fixing groove 512. This position fixing pin 532 has a bo dy 532a, and an auxiliary body 532b on the body 532a. On both sidewalls of the body 532a, teeth 534 engaging with the toothed members 514 are provided.

In addition , a handle 620 is attached on the surface of the support assembly 600 so that a user may i nsert his/her own hand or finger(s) thereto. The handle 620 may also be attached direct ly to the supporting unit 500 or outer sides of the cover members 300 and 400. A user may hold the handle 620 for carrying the bookholder as existing handheld bags, and part icularly, the handle is useful in case that the bookholder is used not on the table but by h olding with hands. That is, a user may insert his or her hand between the handle 620 an d the supporting unit 500 or the cover members 300 and 400 to thereby support the book holder, and adjust readable distance by using his/her arm. At this time, since the book i s fixed by the clamp 330 and the string 510, additional support is not necessary. In doi ng so, the handle 620 is preferably made of various elastic materials such as an elastic b and.<br>
According to one embodiment of the present invention, the bookholder of this e<br>
mbodiment includes a locking unit in order to keep the cover members 100 and 200 ope<br><br>
n during reading. Preferably, the locking unit includes at least one push hook 560 prov ided to either the supporting unit 500 or the cover members 100 and 200, and a hook gro ove 570 formed in either the cover members 100 and 200 or the supporting unit 500 so t hat the push hook 560 is inserted therein. Thus, a user firstly unfolds the cover membe rs 100 and 200, and then pushes the push hook 560 to be inserted into the hook groove 5 70, thereby keeping the cover members 100 and 200 unfolded.<br>
In addition, the bookholder of the present invention may be useful for reading ou tdoors when the support assembly 600 of the supporting unit 500 is used. Referring to FIG. 6 showing configuration of the support assembly 600, the support assembly 600 in eludes a case 630, and a cover 640 for covering the case 630.<br>
The case 630 has a hinge 632 at its one end so that it may be pivotally combined to the supporting unit 500 as described above. Preferably, an angle adjustment groove 634 is formed in the hinge 632 for adjustment of a pivot angle of the support assembly 6 00. The angle adjustment groove 634 is selectively combined with a protrusion (not sh own) formed on the supporting unit 500 so as to set a pivot angle of the support assembl y600.<br>
According to this embodiment, the other end of the case 630 has an opening so t hat a sliding support member 700 may be moved in and out through the opening. The s liding support member 700 is installed so that it may be put into or taken out of the inne r space formed by the case 630 and the cover 640. The sliding support member 700 ma y have a suitable size in accordance with the inner space.<br>
Preferably, the sliding support member 700 is hollow to form a receiving space t<br>
herein and has a plurality of rings 732 mounted on its inner bottom.   The rings 732 are<br>
used for connecting a support string 730, described later.   For example, a hook, not sho<br>
wn, tied at one end of the support string 730 may be hooked around the ring 732.<br><br>
The case 630 also has a toothed hooking member 636 on its inner side in order t o set a position of the sliding support member 700 when the sliding support member 70 0 is taken out. An elastic hook 710 of the sliding support member 700 is selectively ho oked to the toothed hooking member 636 so as to fix a position of the sliding support m ember 700.<br>
According to the present invention, in case the sliding support member 700 is ta ken out when using the bookholder, a pair of auxiliary support arms 740 may be further provided for supporting the bookholder more stably. The auxiliary support arm 740 co nsists of a plurality of support pieces 744 connected each other by joints 742 to be bent.<br>
In addition, one end of the auxiliary support arm 740 is combined with the sliding supp ort member by means of a ball-type hinge so that the auxiliary support arm 740 is pivota ble and rotatable in directions shown by arrows in the figure. The auxiliary support ar m 740 consisting of the support pieces 744 may be bent according to the curvature of hu man body as described later, thereby supporting the bookholder more stably. Many wel I-known techniques capable of realizing such a function may be applied instead of the a uxiliary support arm 740.<br>
Preferably, at a side of the sliding support member 700, a recess portion is prefer ably formed so that the auxiliary support arm 740 may be positioned therein. Thus, wit h the auxiliary support arm 740 folded at both sides, the sliding support member 700 ma y be inserted into the case 630.   In addition, an elongated hole 638 is preferably formed<br>
in the sidewall of the case 630.   The elongated hole 638 allows the auxiliary support a<br>
rm 740 to be spread out with the sliding support member 700 inserted into the case 630.<br>
For example, if the bookholder is used on an uneven place such as a bed, the support a<br>
ssembly 600 is installed to be inclined and then the auxiliary support arms 740 are taken<br>
out and suitably pivoted or rotated so that it may be surface-contacted on the uneven pi<br><br>
ace.   This allows a user to read a book stably in a lying or sitting posture.<br>
According to this embodiment, a taking-out unit for easily taking out the sliding support member 700 from the case 630 is provided at the end of the sliding support me mber 700.<br>
Preferably, the taking-out unit has a grip 750 which is configured for easy grip of a user. More preferably, the grip 750 is made of rubber, or indentation may be formed on the grip for better grip.<br>
FIGs. 7 and 8 show a supporting unit according to another embodiment of the pr esent invention. The supporting unit 800 of this embodiment is suitable for reading a b ook having a thickness larger than the width of the supporting unit in which the cover m embers are incompletely folded. Referring to FIGs. 7 and 8, the supporting unit 800 in eludes movable plates 810 and 820 which are folded with the cover members 100 and 2 00, and a fixed plate 830 whose both ends are inserted into slide grooves 810a and 820a of the movable plates 810 and 820. Thus, a width of the whole supporting unit 800 ma y be extended or shortened by moving the movable plates 810 and 820 in the opposite di rections according to the thickness of the book.<br>
In addition, the supporting unit 800 has a hooking unit for keeping the extended or shortened width of the supporting unit. That is to say. hooks 812 and 822 are mount ed on the movable plates 810 and 820, and a plurality of hooking grooves 832 are forme d on the surface of the fixed plate 830 at regular intervals along the width of the receive d book. As a result, by fitting the hooks 812 and 822 into the hooking groove 832, the supporting unit 800 may keep its width fixed.<br>
In addition, FIG. 9 shows a handle according to another embodiment of the prese<br>
nt invention.   Referring to FIG. 9, a plurality of concave grooves 950 are formed on the<br>
outer surface of the cover members at regular intervals.    Preferably, a distance (L2) bet<br><br>
ween the concave grooves is identical to the distance (Li) between legs of a knob, which acts as a handle.   Thus, a user may hold the bookholder more easily by selectively co mbining the detachable knob 960 into a concave groove(s) 950 at a desired position.<br>
Now, operation of the bookholder configured as described above according to th e present invention is described in detail.<br>
A user may carry a book in the bookholder according to the present invention, no t putting the book into a separate folder or bag. That is to say, as shown in FIG. 1, the book is put into the inner space of the cover members 100 and 200 and then the cover m embers 100 and 200 are folded, the book may be received in the cover members 100 and 200 because the sidewalls 102 and 202 generates a sufficient inner space. In addition, i n case that there is no sidewall as shown in FIG. 2, the book may be fixed in the cover m embers by using the clamp 330 and the string 510 mounted in the cover members 300 an d 400 and the supporting unit 500.<br>
The bookholder of the present invention may also be used on a fixed place such as a table. For example, the cover members 100 and 200 are unfolded straightly and th en the push hook 560 prepared in the cover member is pushed into the hook groove 570 formed in the supporting unit 500. Then, the cover members 100 and 200 are not pivot ed but fixed to the supporting unit 500. As an alternative, as shown in FIG. 1, the cove r members 100 and 200 and the supporting unit 500 may be stably fixed to form the sam e surface with the use of the locking unit 180 having the bar 182 and the concave groove 184.<br>
In this state, the support assembly 600 is pivoted backward with respect to the hi nge to support the bookholder on the ground as shown in FIG. 5. Then, a user may rea d a book with the use of the bookholder of the present invention at a fixed place such as<br>
a table.<br><br>
Meanwhile, in order to put a book on the bookholder, a user firstly sets a positio n of the bookholder, opens the book by its substantially half page, and then fits the positi on fixing pin 532 at a suitable position with putting the string 510 in the supporting unit across the spine of the book. Then, book covers are fixed in contact with the inner surf aces of the cover members 100 and 200. If the support plate is employed, the book is a rranged so that the front cover of the book contacts with the support plate 110 and a rear cover contacts with the support plate 210. And then, the guide member 140 is vertical ly adjusted to conform to the size of book, and then a position of the clamp 130 is also s et.<br>
Subsequently, if a user pushes a page below the clamp 130 with turning over the page or presses the clamp 130, the protrusion pressing unit 132 is pivoted to pass the pa ge as mentioned above. The protrusion pressing unit 132 then restores its origin state a t once by means of the elastic member 134 so that the page is supported not to be turned . At this time, the support plate 110 in contact with the front cover of the book biases t he book cover upward by means of the elastic member 112, so the page may be more sta bly supported between the clamp 130 and the support plate 110. The same principle m ay be applied to the rear cover of the book. If the book is thick, as shown in FIGs. 3 an d 4, a thickness of the inner space of the cover members may be selectively adjusted wit h the use of the extendable clamp 330. In addition, a thicker book may be received in t he bookholder by extending a width of the supporting unit 500 as shown in FIGs. 7 and 8.<br>
According to the present invention, in the above state, since a user inserts one ha<br>
nd into the handle 620 on the outside of the supporting unit 500 or the cover members 1<br>
00 and 200 to thereby uniformly transfer the center of weight through the arm, he/she ca<br>
n read the book in anyplace. Particularly, in a vehicle such as a subway or a bus a user c<br><br>
an hold a handle of the vehicle by one hand with the other hand inserted into the handle 620 to support the bookholder as he/she likes, which enables a user to comfortably read the book when standing in a vehicle.<br>
Also, when a user folds the cover members 100 and 200 of the bookholder after r eading, the book is closed and received in the bookholder in a current state.   Thus, if th e bookholder is open later, the page of the book is open as it was.   Thus, the user need not struggle to find the page which was being read before.<br>
Meanwhile, as shown in FIG. 10, if a user desires to use the bookholder without the support of hands, the user pulls the handle 750 to draw out the sliding support memb er 700. While the sliding support member 700 is drawn out, the elastic hook 710 come s in contact with the toothed hooking member 636 to determine its position. Thus, the si iding support member 700 may be drawn out and fixed as much as a suitable length as r equired.<br>
In addition, the bookholder of the present invention may be additionally supporte d with the use of the support string 730 by hanging the support string 730 on the neck or the shoulder of the user. That is to say, the support string 730 may be supported aroun d the neck or the shoulder by connecting it to at least one ring 732 mounted to the slidin g support member 700. In this case, a hooking unit (not shown) having easy detachme nt function is prepared to the support string 730, thereby facilitating easy connection bet ween the support string 730 and the ring 732. In addition, for more stable support, the support string 730 is preferably connected to a ring 732 which is positioned at a substant ial center between the upper end of the bookholder and the end of the drawn sliding sup port member 700.<br>
According to the present invention, in order to support the bookholder better, the<br>
auxiliary support arms 740 may be used.   That is to say, if the auxiliary support arms 7<br><br>
40 are spread and then put on the body of the user with suitable bending of the joints 74 2, the bookholder may be supported more stably without lateral shaking.<br>
FIG. 11 shows a stand for fixing the bookholder of the present invention. Refer ring to FIG. 11, the bookholder may be selectively combined to a stand 900 of a predeter mined structure.<br>
The stand 900 includes a base 910, an arm 920 extended from the base 910 and h aving plural joints for free movement, and a connector 930 prepared at the end of the ar m 920 and combined with the bookholder.<br>
The base 910 has sufficient weight and size so that the bookholder combined to t he stand does not fall down, and a support clamp, not shown, may also be provided to th e base. The arm 920 has at least two joints so that a user may read a book with the use of the bookholder in any posture. In addition, the connector 930 is configured to ensur e power supply to the bookholder. For example, the power supply may be directly supp lied from an external source to the illustrating unit. In addition, this process also may c harge a power source 178 which is installed in the sidewall 102.<br>
The present invention has been described in detail. However, it should be unde rstood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating preferred em bodiments of the invention, are given by way of illustration only, since various changes and modifications within the spirit and scope of the invention will become apparent to t hose skilled in the art from this detailed description. INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
The universal bookholder of the present invention has effects as follows.<br>
First, since the bookholder may be carried together with a book, the volume of th<br>
e bookholder and the book is decreased than when they are carried separately.   In additi<br>
on, a user may carry the book and the bookholder more easily.<br><br>
Second, the book received in the cover members may be kept so that it may be open as it was. In addition, since the bookholder may store various pens and scratch papers, the bookholder is useful outdoors.<br>
Third, the bookholder may facilitate reading of a user who is standing in a vehicle su ch as a subway or a bus. Because a user who is standing in a vehicle wants to read a book, h e can hold a handle of the vehicle safely by one hand by virtue of the other hand which is ins erted into the handle on the outer side of the bookholder. At this time, the current page of the book is fixed by the clamp and the string, which prevents the book from leaving its position . As a result, a user does not need to struggle to hold both pages by one hand but simply inse rt his/her hand into the handle, and then may read easily and safely even standing in a vehicl e.<br>
Fourth, the bookholder may conveniently keep a book of a certain weight within a re adable distance with its pages fixed without being supported by user's hand.<br>
Fifth, the bookholder is useful while a user is moving, and the bookholder may also be put on a table. In addition, if being combined with a stand, the bookholder may be positi oned within a readable distance by moving joints of the stand, so a user may read a book on t he bookholder in various postures and at various angles. The bookholder even makes it pos sible that a user who is lying reads a book.<br>
Sixth, the bookholder allows a user to read a book with the use of the illustrating uni t mounted thereto without any separate light source in a dark place.<br>
Seventh, since the cover members cover and protect the book, a user can hide the bo ok covers that he or she does not want to show to others. Also, the book inside the bookhold er can be prevented from the physical impact or outer environment. In addition, the cover me mbers give various visual effects according to user's taste.<br>
