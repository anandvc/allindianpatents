TORQUE-TRANSMITTING ASSEMBLY WITH DOG CLUTCH AND<br>
HYDROSTATIC DAMPER AND ELECTRICALLY VARIABLE<br>
TRANSMISSION WITH SAME<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]	The invention relates to a torque-transmitting assembly with a dog<br>
clutch and a hydrostatic damper that may be used in an electrically variable<br>
transmission to transmit torque.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	A dog clutch is engaged to transmit torque by moving two sets of teeth<br>
together to intermesh with one another. A dog clutch may be engaged in a random<br>
combination of positions as both sets of teeth circumscribe two rotating shafts that are<br>
to be brought together for common rotation by engagement of the clutch. If the teeth<br>
are not closely set, there will be a significant amount of uncontrolled motion in the<br>
clutch when it is engaged, creating noise in a drivetrain utilizing the clutch.<br>
Therefore, in order to minimize the amount of uncontrolled motion when the dog<br>
clutch is engaged, the two sets of teeth should be closely set relative to one another<br>
when the dog clutch is engaged. This requires that the two sides of the dog clutch be<br>
very nearly aligned with one another and therefore synchronized, i.e., turning at the<br>
same speed, for engagement to be successful.<br>
[0003]	Manual transmissions typically have a plate clutch that releases the<br>
transmission input shaft from the engine when disengaged. A dog clutch with one<br>
side (i.e., one of the sets of teeth) connected to the transmission input shaft then has<br>
only a few components connected thereto, and therefore a relatively small amount of<br>
inertia and resistance to rotational movement. This allows a synchronizer to be<br>
employed to synchronize that side of the dog clutch to rotate at the same speed as the<br>
other side of the dog clutch, allowing for smooth and reliable engagement of the dog<br>
clutch.<br><br>
GP-308288-PTH-CD<br>
2<br>
[0004]	The implementation of dog clutches in other types of transmissions,<br>
such as electrically-variable transmissions, has thus far been prevented because<br>
relatively heavy components, such as a motor/generator with its relatively large<br>
inertia, would be connected to either side of the dog clutch. Additionally, in a vehicle<br>
with an electrically-variable transmission, the side of the dog clutch operatively<br>
connected to the wheels on a vehicle would sometime be subjected to strong random<br>
torque inputs when the vehicle is riding over a bumpy surface. Typical synchronizers<br>
would not be able to synchronize the speeds of both sides of the dog clutch under such<br>
conditions.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0005]	A torque-transmitting assembly is provided that includes a dog clutch<br>
isolated by a rotary hydrostatic damper from relative loading on a torque input<br>
member and a torque output member that it connects for common rotation and torque<br>
transmission. Although its use is not limited to electrically-variable transmissions, the<br>
torque transmitting assembly is able to function even with the large inertia and<br>
potentially random torque inputs associated with theses types of transmissions.<br>
[0006]	More specifically, the torque-transmitting assembly includes a<br>
selectively engagable dog clutch in series with a rotary hydrostatic damper. The dog<br>
clutch has first and second rotatable components that are selectively engagable with<br>
one another to transmit torque from a torque input member to a torque output<br>
member. The hydrostatic damper is operatively connected mechanically in series<br>
with the dog clutch between the torque input member and the torque output member<br>
(i.e., on one side of the dog clutch). The damper dampens random torque inputs to<br>
provide a variable resistance to relative rotation of the first and second components of<br>
the dog clutch. That is, the resistance to engagement of the dog clutch is dependent<br>
only on the damper, and is preferably unaffected by loading of the torque input and<br>
output members.<br><br>
GP-308288-PTH-CD<br>
3<br>
[0007]	In one embodiment, the hydrostatic damper has two rotatable members<br>
that are relatively rotatable with respect to one another over a range of less than one<br>
rotation (e.g., approximately 180 degrees). Preferably, hydrostatic fluid between the<br>
two rotatable members may be varied in volume to control the resistance to relative<br>
rotation of the members. It is also preferable that a spring is connected between the<br>
two members to urge them to a substantially centered orientation within the range of<br>
permitted relative rotation, so that equal rotation in either direction will be possible in<br>
response to a random torque component.<br>
[0008]	Within the scope of the invention, a synchronizer may be utilized<br>
between the two rotatable components of the dog clutch to synchronize these<br>
components of the dog clutch prior to engagement of the dog clutch teeth.<br>
Specifically, the synchronizer has a cone and blocking teeth, and is alignable for<br>
common rotation with the first rotatable component when the cone causes the<br>
synchronizer to rotate at the same speed as the second rotatable member of the dog<br>
clutch to which it is axially adjacent. In this state, the blocking teeth are aligned with<br>
the first set of dog clutch teeth, which are internal teeth on the first rotatable<br>
component. The first rotatable component of the dog clutch with the first set of dog<br>
clutch teeth thereon are thus blocked from engagement with the second set of teeth at<br>
this point, until a spring biases the first rotatable component and the synchronizer to a<br>
slightly rotated position relative to one another in which the blocking teeth arc out of<br>
the way of the first set of teeth (i.e., blocking teeth are no longer aligned with the first<br>
set of teeth). The first rotatable component may then continue to move axially toward<br>
the second rotatable component, under the control of a controller, while maintaining<br>
engagement with the second rotating member of the damper, so that the first set of<br>
teeth engage with the second set of teeth.<br>
[0009]	In another embodiment, the controllable rotary hydrostatic damper<br>
partially defines a cavity housing a variable displacement pump. The pump is<br>
connected for rotation with the torque input member. The damper is expandable by<br>
increasing hydraulic pressure to axially displace the first rotatable component of the<br>
dog clutch into engagement with the second rotatable component of the dog clutch,<br>
thereby transferring torque from the torque input member to the torque output<br><br>
GP-308288-PTH-CD<br>
4<br>
member. Pumped fluid within the damper dampens any random torque inputs,<br>
allowing for a relatively smooth and reliable engagement. The damper is at a<br>
minimum volume when the dog clutch is disengaged, so its resistance to rotation is<br>
also at a minimum, allowing the two sets of teeth to align and the dog clutch to close.<br>
As the dog clutch engages, the damper volume and resistance to rotation increase.<br>
[0010]	The torque-transmitting assembly may be used in an electrically-<br>
variable transmission between a transmission input member and a transmission output<br>
member. The dog clutch may be engaged to change an operating mode of the<br>
transmission, preferably with the engagement not being dependent on loading of the<br>
transmission input member and output member due to the damping function of a<br>
device such as a hydrostatic damper as described above. (As used herein, a "mode"<br>
or an "operating mode" is a particular operating state, whether encompassing a<br>
continuous range of speed ratios or only a fixed speed ratio, achieved by<br>
engagement of a particular torque-transmitting mechanism or torque-transmitting<br>
mechanisms.) The shift may be from an input-split mode to a compound-split mode.<br>
Preferably, a friction-based torque-transmitting mechanism is released when the dog<br>
clutch is engaged to shift between the two operating modes.<br>
[0011]	In one embodiment, the electrically-variable transmission has two<br>
motor/generators and two differential gear sets, which are preferably planetary gear<br>
sets, each having first, second and third members. The transmission input member is<br>
continuously connected for common rotation with the first member of the first<br>
planetary gear set. The second member of the first planetary gear set and the first<br>
member of the second planetary gear set are connected for common rotation with the<br>
transmission output member. The first motor/generator is connected for common<br>
rotation with the third member of the first planetary gear set. The second<br>
motor/generator is conneceted for common rotation with the second member of the<br>
second planetary gear set. A friction brake is selectively engagable to ground the<br>
third member of the second planetary gear set to a stationary member, thereby<br>
establishing an input-split mode of operation. The dog clutch is selectively engagable<br>
to connect the third member of the first planetary gear set for common rotation with<br><br>
GP-308288-PTH-CD<br>
5<br>
the third member of the second planetary gear set, thereby establishing a compound-<br>
split mode of operation.<br>
[0012]	The above features and advantages and other features and advantages<br>
of the present invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description<br>
of the best modes for carrying out the invention when taken in connection with the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0013]	FIGURE 1 is a schematic cross-sectional illustration of an electrically<br>
variable transmission including a torque-transmitting assembly with a rotary<br>
hydrostatic damper and a dog clutch;<br>
[0014]	FIGURE 2 is a perspective exploded view of the torque-transmitting<br>
assembly used in the electrically-variable transmission of Figure 1; and<br>
[0015]	FIGURE 3 is a perspective exploded view of an alternative<br>
embodiment of a torque-transmitting assembly that may be used in the electrically-<br>
variable transmission of Figure 1.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0016]	Referring to the drawings, wherein like reference numbers refer to like<br>
components, Figure 1 shows an electrically-variable transmission 10 with a<br>
transmission input member 12 and a transmission output member 14. The<br>
transmission 10 includes a transmission gearing arrangement 16. The transmission<br>
gearing arrangement has first and second differential gear sets, which in this<br>
embodiment are planetary gear sets 20, 30. The planetary gear set 20 includes a sun<br>
gear member 22, a ring gear member 24 and a carrier member 26 that rotatably<br>
supports planet gears 28 that intermesh with both the sun gear member 22 and the ring<br>
gear member 24. The second planetary gear set 30 includes a sun gear member 32, a<br>
ring gear member 34 and a carrier member 36 that rotatably supports planet gears 38<br>
that intermesh with both the sun gear member 32 and the ring gear member 34.<br><br>
GP-308288-PTH-CD<br>
6<br>
[0017]	The transmission 10 further includes a first motor/generator 40A and a<br>
second motor/generator 40B. The first motor/generator 40A includes a rotor 42A that<br>
is operatively connected for common rotation with the sun gear member 22 via a<br>
sleeve shaft 44A and a stator 46A that is grounded to a stationary member 48, such as<br>
a housing or casing of the transmission 10. The second motor/generator 40B includes<br>
a rotor 42B that is operatively connected for common rotation with the sun gear<br>
member 32 via a sleeve shaft 44B and a stator 46B that is grounded to the stationary<br>
member 48.<br>
[0018]	The transmission input member 12 is connected for common rotation<br>
with the ring gear member 24. The carrier member 26 is connected for common<br>
rotation with the carrier member 36 via hubs 47 and 50 as well as intermediate shaft<br>
52. The intermediate shaft 52 rotates commonly with, and may be integral with the<br>
transmission output member 14.<br>
[0019]	The transmission 10 has two selectively engagable torque-transmitting<br>
mechanisms. The first is a torque-transmitting assembly 56 that has a dog clutch 58<br>
in series with a rotary hydrostatic damper 60. The second is a friction-based torque-<br>
transmitting mechanism, brake 62, selectively engagable to ground the ring gear<br>
member 34 to the stationary member 48. (A friction-based rotary clutch could be<br>
used within the scope of the invention, but a brake is preferred, for the reasons set<br>
forth below.) The use of a friction brake 62 and a dog clutch 58 increases the<br>
efficiency of the electrically-variable transmission 10, as both of these torque-<br>
transmitting mechanisms may be engaged with relatively low power and losses in<br>
comparison with rotating friction clutches. Rotating friction clutches typically require<br>
either a strong spring and throw out bearing, such as on a manual transmission, or a<br>
rotating hydraulic seal and a high pressure oil supply, such as on an automatic<br>
transmission, both of which have high associated energy losses due to increased<br>
friction and the need for pumping power, respectively. The dog clutch 58 requires<br>
only a low pressure oil to actuate, (either by piston or fork, as described in the<br>
embodiments below) and low pressure oil is already necessary in the electrically<br>
variable transmission to lubricate the gears in the transmission gearing arrangement<br>
16.<br><br>
GP-308288-PTH-CD<br>
7<br>
[0020]	A controller 64 controls power flow between an electric storage device<br>
66 (such as a battery) and the respective motor/generators 40A, 40B to control their<br>
respective functioning as a motor or as a generator, as is understood by those skilled<br>
in the art. The controller 64 also controls the torque-transmitting assembly 56 to<br>
selectively engage the dog clutch 58, as will be discussed in greater detail below.<br>
Specifically, the controller 64 controls the torque-transmitting assembly 56 to cause<br>
axial motion of a rotatable component 70 of the dog clutch 58, causing a set of teeth<br>
74 on the first rotatable component 70 (the first set of teeth) to engage with a set of<br>
teeth 76 on a second rotatable component 72 (the second set of teeth) of the dog<br>
clutch 58. In this embodiment, a synchronizer 95 with blocking teeth 93 allows for<br>
smooth engagement of the dog clutch 58, as will be described in more detail with<br>
respect to Figure 2. The first rotatable component 70 is annular, as illustrated in<br>
Figure 2. However, in Figure 1, the cross-sectional view of the first rotatable<br>
component, a top section is shown representing a disengaged position in which the<br>
first rotatable component is referred to as 70, while a bottom section is shown<br>
representing an alternate engaged position, in which the first rotatable component is<br>
referred to as 70A. Thus, to engage, the first rotatable component 70 moves in the<br>
direction of arrow A, while to disengage the first rotatable component 70A moves in<br>
the direction of arrow B. It should be appreciated that the entire first rotatable<br>
component is either in the engaged position (represented by 70A) or the disengaged<br>
position (represented by 70), and the top and bottom sections are not independently<br>
movable with respect to one another.<br>
[0021]	Those skilled in the art will readily recognize that engagement of the<br>
friction brake 62 while the dog clutch 58 remains disengaged establishes an input-split<br>
mode of operation. Disengaging the friction brake 62 and engaging the dog clutch 58<br>
shifts from the input-split mode of operation to a compound-split mode of operation.<br>
By utilizing the torque-transmitting assembly 56, as more specifically described with<br>
respect to Figure 2, or the alternative torque-transmitting assembly 156 described with<br>
respect to Figure 3, the shift from the input-split mode to the compound-split mode<br>
can be synchronous, as the hydrostatic damper 60 is able to dampen random<br>
differences in speed between a sleeve shaft 44A and a sleeve shaft 44B (which may<br><br>
GP-308288-PTH-CD<br>
8<br>
be considered the torque input member and the torque output member, in either order)<br>
of the torque-transmitting assembly 56. The load (i.e., torque) differentials or random<br>
differences in speeds experienced by the respective sleeve shafts 44A, 44B<br>
correspond with random load differentials experienced by the transmission input<br>
member 12 and the transmission output member 14. By isolating the load and/or<br>
speed differentials in the hydrostatic damper 60, the sets of teeth 74, 76 of the dog<br>
clutch 58 may be engaged due to axial motion of the first rotatable component 70<br>
(indicated by arrow A in Figure 1), with relatively little resistance to engagement even<br>
though the resistance to relative rotation of the shafts 44A and 71 (which rotates<br>
commonly with second rotatable component 72) may be high, as the transmission 10<br>
may be relatively stiff (dynamically) in torsion.<br>
[0022]	Referring now to Figure 2, the torque-transmitting assembly 56 of<br>
Figure 1 is shown in greater detail. The damper 60 has a first rotatable member 80<br>
that rotates commonly with the sleeve shaft 44A. A pair of external vanes 82 extends<br>
in a common plane from the first rotatable member 80, intersecting an axis of rotation<br>
C of the sleeve shaft 44A. The damper 60 further includes a second rotatable member<br>
84 through which the sleeve shaft 44A extends. A centering torsion spring 86<br>
connects at one end to the second rotatable member 84 and at another end through the<br>
sleeve shaft 44A. A pair of opposed internal vanes 88 extend inward into a hollow<br>
center of the second rotatable member 84. The spring 86 mounts the second rotatable<br>
member 84 to the sleeve shaft 44A and is pretensioned to urge the second rotatable<br>
member 84 into the substantially centered orientation shown with respect to the first<br>
rotatable member 80, in which the vanes 82 and 88 are roughly perpendicular,<br>
allowing relative rotation of the second rotatable member 84 with respect to the first<br>
rotatable member 80 in approximately ninety degrees in either direction over a total<br>
range of approximately one hundred-eighty degrees.<br><br>
GP-308288-PTH-CD<br>
9<br>
[0023]	The torque-transmitting assembly 56 includes a synchronizer 95 that<br>
has external blocking teeth 93 and a cone 91. The cone 91 is adjacent a cavity 92 in<br>
the second rotatable component 72 that is configured to receive the cone 91. The first<br>
rotatable component 70 (which may be referred to as a collar) includes the first set of<br>
teeth 74, which are internal teeth continuously engaged with external teeth 94 on the<br>
second rotatable member 84 of the damper 60. A groove 90 in the first rotatable<br>
component 70 receives a fork (not shown) that is moved by a controller (such as<br>
controller 64 or Figure 1) to axially slide the first rotatable component 70 to the right.<br>
The axial movement is small enough so that the teeth 74 remain engaged with the<br>
teeth 94 and the second rotatable member 84 continues to rotate commonly with the<br>
first rotatable component 70. A controller slides the first rotatable component 70 in<br>
this manner when the synchronizer cone 91 (and the first rotatable component 70) are<br>
turning at the same speed as the second rotatable component 72 of the dog clutch 58,<br>
as indicated by sensors operatively connected with the first and second rotatable<br>
members 70, 72 of the dog clutch 58.<br>
[0024]	A first spring 96 has one end held in an opening 97A in the first<br>
rotatable component 70 and another end twisted to lie in a ramped slot 98A of the<br>
synchronizer 95. Another opening 97B and ramped slot 98B similarly receive a<br>
second, like spring (not shown). The ramped nature of the slots 98A and 98B allow<br>
the first spring 96 (and second spring) to be nested in the slots when the first rotatable<br>
component 70 moves to the right to engage the second rotatable component 72. The<br>
spring 96 presses the cone 91 into the cavity 92 with a light force to begin to<br>
synchronize the speeds of the synchronizer 95 and the second rotatable component 72.<br>
This interaction between the cone 91 and the cavity 92 slightly rotates the<br>
synchronizer 95 relative to the first rotatable component 70, to the extent permitted by<br>
the spring 96, to align the blocking teeth 93 with the internal teeth 74, thus blocking<br>
engagement of the internal teeth 74 with the external teeth 76. Once the<br>
synchronizer 95 and the second rotatable component 72 are rotating at the same<br>
speed, the spring force of the spring 96 rotates the synchronizer slightly relative to the<br>
first rotatable component 70 to move the blocking teeth out of the way of the internal<br>
teeth 74 to allow the first rotatable component to move further axially and the internal<br><br>
GP-308288-PTH-CD<br>
10<br>
teeth 74 to then engage the external teeth 76. Thus, by controlling the first rotatable<br>
component 70 to slide and cause engagement of the dog clutch 58 only when the<br>
speeds of the first and second rotatable components 70, 72 are the same, synchronized<br>
engagement is accomplished, while the one hundred-eighty degree range of motion or<br>
"play" between the first and second rotatable members 80, 84 of the damper 60<br>
absorbs any small amount of random motion between the two shafts 44A, 71.<br>
[0025]	Referring to Figure 3, an alternative embodiment of a torque-<br>
transmitting assembly 156 is depicted that may be used in place of torque-transmitting<br>
assembly 56 in the electrically-variable transmission 10 of Figure 1. The torque-<br>
transmitting assembly 156 includes a dog clutch 158 and a variable displacement<br>
rotary hydrostatic damper 160 capable of continuous rotation (i.e. without being<br>
limited in its angle of rotation) when the dog clutch 158 is disengaged. The dog<br>
clutch 158 has a first rotatable component 170 with a first set of teeth 174 that are<br>
selectively engagable with a second set of teeth 176 on a second rotatable component<br>
172 of the dog clutch 158. The second rotatable component 172 rotates commonly<br>
with shaft 171, which would be identical in location to sleeve shaft 71 in the<br>
electrically variable transmission 10 Figure 1.<br>
[0026]	The damper 160 includes a hub 180 connected for rotation with shaft<br>
144A, which would be identical in location to sleeve shaft 44A in the electrically-<br>
variable transmission 10 of Figure 1. A casing 181 surrounds the hub 180 and is<br>
closed on one end by an end cover 183 and on an opposing end by the first rotatable<br>
component 170 of the dog clutch 158. A spacer 187 fits within an eccentric circular<br>
or oval cavity 185 formed through the casing 181 and is held in a definite axial<br>
position along shaft 144A by a retaining collar 199, which is press fit securely onto<br>
shaft 144A but which allows the spacer 187 to rotate freely with respect to the shaft<br>
144A. The shaft 144A extends through aligned openings in the end cover 183 and the<br>
spacer 187. A containing ring 189 is free to rotate within a hollowed opening 192 in<br>
the first rotatable component 170. The hollowed opening 192 does not extend<br>
completely through the first rotatable component 170, so that the first rotatable<br>
component 170 serves, along with the end cover 183, to close off the cavity 185 when<br>
the torque-transmitting assembly 156 is assembled.<br><br>
GP-308288-PTH-CD<br>
11<br>
[0027]	When the dog clutch 158 is disengaged, spacer 187 is positioned flush<br>
with the right end of the casing 181 and the hub 180 is positioned in the containing<br>
ring 189 in the hollowed opening 192, with pump vanes 193 held almost entirely<br>
within receiving slots 194 in the containing ring 189. A small amount of each pump<br>
vane 193, along its left edge, is held within the eccentric or oval cavity 185 in the<br>
casing 181, to hold the pump vane 193 in the correct position for engagement of the<br>
dog clutch 158. This position of the vanes 193 just slightly within the cavity 185, and<br>
with the spacer 187 very close to the containing ring 189, defines the minimum<br>
displacement for the rotary hydraulic damper 160. In this position, the damper 160<br>
can produce almost no torque, so the first rotatable component 170, the casing 185,<br>
the spacer 187 and the end cover 183 can rotate almost freely with respect to the<br>
containing ring 189, the pump vanes 193, the hub 180, the shaft 144A, and the<br>
retaining collar 199.<br>
[0028]	To engage the dog clutch 158, oil is fed through an opening 195 in the<br>
casing 181. The oil flows between the right side of the casing 181 and the spacer 187<br>
and the left side of the containing ring 189, creating hydraulic pressure that moves the<br>
containing ring 189, the first rotatable component 170, the casing 181 and the end<br>
cover 183 to the right with respect to the spacer 187 and the hub 180, to engage the<br>
teeth 174 and 176 of the dog clutch 158. Thus, the oil drives the containing ring 189<br>
apart from the spacer 187, expanding oil chambers contained within the cavity 185 of<br>
the casing 181 between the spacer 187 and the ring 189. This axial movement<br>
increases the displacement within the expanding oil chambers which are each defined<br>
by the hub 180, the casing 181, the vanes 193, the spacer 187 and the ring 189. Thus,<br>
the stiffness of the damper 160 (i.e., its ability to transmit torque), which is dependent<br>
on the displacement of the chambers, is integral with the axial movement of the first<br>
rotatable component 170 and the attached components (i.e., the containing ring 189,<br>
the casing 181 and the end cover 183). These axially-movable components function<br>
as a hydraulic piston in response to the rising hydraulic pressure. When the dog<br>
clutch 158 is engaged, the casing 181 has moved axially to the right relative to the<br>
spacer 187 so that the retaining collar 199 is at the left end of the casing, against the<br>
end cover 183 at full engagement. Oil is allowed to escape from this side of the<br><br>
GP-308288-PTH-CD<br>
12<br>
cavity 185 through an opening 197. To disengage the dog clutch 158, oil is pumped<br>
into opening 197 in the end cover 183 and allowed to escape through opening 195<br>
from among the pump vanes, to easily disengage the clutch 158 by moving end cover<br>
183, the casing 181, and the first rotatable component 170 back to the left. Pump<br>
vanes 193 are kept in alignment with the cuts in the ring 189 by the relative lengths of<br>
the components, so that the vanes 193 are always engaged with the ring 189 by at<br>
least a small distance along the axis, even when the clutch is fully engaged.<br>
