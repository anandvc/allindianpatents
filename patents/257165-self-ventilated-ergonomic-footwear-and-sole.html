				<td>SELF-VENTILATED, ERGONOMIC FOOTWEAR AND SOLE<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to footwear and a sole<br>
which said footwear comprises but which can be applied to<br>
other types of footwear. On the one hand, the footwear offers<br>
optimum performance from an ergonomic point of view adapting<br>
itself perfectly to the user's foot irrespective of the<br>
different relation between the length and width of said foot<br>
due to an elastomeric sole or the like, generally obtained by<br>
means of injection moulding, subsequently covered by means of<br>
an insole and combined with the corresponding upper to finish<br>
the footwear, and on the other hand allowing for inner<br>
ventilation which is automatically generated on walking, also<br>
improving comfort in this aspect.<br>
Thus, the object of the invention is to obtain footwear<br>
offering the user thereof greater comfort, both from the point<br>
of view of the comfortable adaptation to his feet and also the<br>
ventilation thereof, and a sole which in the area<br>
corresponding to the sole of the foot has a high degree of<br>
elastic deformability in the transverse direction in order: to<br>
enhance the comfort of the footwear for the user, anatomically<br>
adapting itself to the feet thereof, irrespective of their<br>
greater or lesser width.<br>
BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION<br>
Within the scope of footwear, and more specifically of<br>
soles for same, one of the solutions normally used is that in<br>
which the sole is obtained by means of injection moulding from<br>
elastomeric materials.<br>
The outsoles are manufactured according to preestablished<br>
sizes, based on a stepped table of foot lengths,<br>
such that any person can find shoes in the market with a size<br>
suited to the length of his feet.<br>
The same does not apply regarding the transverse<br>
elevation, as this is usually fixed for a certain type or<br>
design of footwear, which as is known means a serious problem<br>
for those having "wide feet" , who are forced to bear the<br>
discomfort of shoes which "pinch them" or are forced to use a<br>
larger size than they should depending on the length of the<br>
foot, because evidently as the size of the footwear increases,<br>
the width thereof increases in parallel.<br>
The solution to this problem is to use lasts of<br>
different widths, this evidently having very negative effects<br>
from an economic point of view, specifically from the point of<br>
view of manufacturing and distribution costs.<br>
A less encumbering solution is to use uppers based on<br>
soft materials, which partially resolves the problem,<br>
especially when the user's feet are not much wider than normal,<br>
but this leads to a deformation of the footwear making it lose<br>
its original appearance completely after a short period of use.<br>
On the other hand, due to their very nature, these<br>
elastomeric soles offer virtually no degree of transpiration,<br>
such that they retain the user's body sweat, it thus being<br>
desirable to have an inner ventilation of the footwear for<br>
evaporating the sweat as it is produced.<br>
Footwear provided with means of inner ventilation exists<br>
on the market, but the solutions adopted up to the present are<br>
structurally complex and functionally rather ineffective, thus<br>
their practical use is determined more by advertising<br>
propaganda than by a real effectiveness to that respect.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The footwear and the sole proposed by the invention<br>
resolves in a fully satisfactory manner the problems set forth<br>
hereinbefore in the two aspects discussed, so that in addition<br>
to offering optimum performance from the ergonomic point of<br>
view, perfectly adapting themselves to the anatomy of the<br>
user's foot, it allows said ventilation which occurs<br>
automatically when walking.<br>
To that end and more specifically, the footwear of the<br>
invention, based on the use of an elastomeric sole obtained<br>
for example by means of injection moulding, combines special<br>
features of said sole with other features affecting its<br>
complementary upper and allowing the effects sought to be<br>
obtained.<br>
Specifically, the sole is provided with longitudinal<br>
grooves in the area corresponding to the sole of the foot,<br>
that is, extending between the toe and the start of the waist,<br>
operatively arranged both on its upper or inner side and on<br>
its lower or outer side, which grooves affect about half the<br>
thickness of the sole in this area, said plurality of<br>
longitudinal grooves, preferably of an arched path, that is<br>
parallel to the side edges of the sole in its area of location,<br>
with the special particularity that the grooves of its upper<br>
side are transversely staggered with respect to those of the<br>
lower side, such that this area of the sole configures a type<br>
of bellows allowing elastic deformation in the transverse<br>
direction of the sole in said area of the sole of the foot due<br>
to the pressure exerted by the foot depending on the width of<br>
the latter which is obviously where the problems derived from<br>
"wide feet" occur.<br>
Accordingly, the original dimensions of the width of the<br>
sole in the area corresponding to the sole of the foot are<br>
maintained when the user has a normal foot width, but faced<br>
with the needs of a wider foot an easy transverse dilation of<br>
the sole in this area of the sole of the foot occurs, that is,<br>
a widening thereof occurs, suiting it to the needs of the foot,<br>
conferring the footwear with a high degree of comfort.<br>
This greater comfort can be extended to any type of user<br>
because the same elastic deformability occurs under normal<br>
conditions, making the footwear much more comfortable as it<br>
has a "softer" sole without changing the material.<br>
Complementarily, the upper which is closed in the lower<br>
portion and, as is usual, by means of an insole, also<br>
incorporates in the area of the sole of the foot an elastic<br>
body, which due to its own nature favours the elastic<br>
deformation in the transverse direction of the footwear in<br>
this repeatedly said area of the sole of the foot, and which<br>
further incorporates openings suitably distributed for the<br>
entrance and exit of air. A chamber is thus created between<br>
the elastic body and the sole the volume of which changes upon<br>
walking due to the expansion and contraction of the elements<br>
making it up, which volumetric variation leads to a "lung"<br>
effect such that the air enters and exits said chamber,<br>
causing the sought ventilation of the foot in the area of the<br>
footwear which is the most problematic to that respect, that<br>
is in the closed area of the sole of the foot, because<br>
ventilation usually occurs in the heel area through the foot<br>
access opening.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
To accompany the description being made and for the<br>
purpose of better understanding the features of the invention,<br>
according to a preferred practical embodiment thereof, a set<br>
of drawings is attached as an integral part of said<br>
description in which, with an illustrative and non-limiting<br>
character, the following is shown:<br>
Figure 1 shows a schematic perspective illustration of a<br>
sole for footwear carried out according to the object of the<br>
present invention, showing the upper side thereof.<br>
Figure 2 shows an illustration similar to the previous<br>
figure, but in which the lower side of the sole is shown.<br>
Figure 3 shows an exploded plan view of a selfventilated<br>
ergonomic footwear carried out according to the<br>
object of the present invention in which both the upper of the<br>
footwear and the sole thereof show the sides through which<br>
they must be adapted and fixed.<br>
Figure 4 sows a cross section detail of the assembly<br>
represented in the previous figure, duly assembled.<br>
PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>
In view of Figures 1 and 2, it can be seen how the sole<br>
(1) proposed by the invention is, like any conventional sole,<br>
made up of a one-piece body with the classic sections<br>
corresponding to the sole of the foot, to the waist and to the<br>
heel, these sections being able to adopt, particularly as<br>
regards the outer side shown in Figure 2, any type of surface<br>
finish or configuration in accordance with the design provided<br>
for the sole.<br>
The invention centres on the fact that the sole (1)<br>
incorporates on its inner side and in the area corresponding<br>
to the sole of the foot, a plurality of uniformly distributed<br>
longitudinal grooves (5) which, in the practical embodiment<br>
shown in the drawing, are five in number, but this number can<br>
vary without this affecting the essence of the invention,<br>
which grooves are preferably curved and parallel to the side<br>
edge and next to the body of the sole.<br>
Said grooves (5) of the upper side of the sole are<br>
complemented with other lower grooves (5') which must<br>
necessarily be arranged in an alternating manner with respect<br>
to the upper grooves (5) , as can be observed perfectly in<br>
Figure 4, for which reason there must be a higher or lower<br>
number of lower grooves than upper grooves (5) , the number<br>
being greater in the chosen practical embodiment, specifically<br>
six.<br>
The depth of the grooves (5) and (5'), in relation to<br>
the thickness of the sole in this area of the sole of the foot<br>
must be such that it affects about half of said thickness in<br>
order to obtain the bellows-type structure shown in Figure 4<br>
which, providing the sole with the suitable formal stability,<br>
nevertheless allows that, in the specific case of a "wide<br>
feet" user, the sole can be elastically deformed in the sense<br>
of transverse widening to perfectly adapt itself to the<br>
dimensional demands of the foot as previously stated.<br>
Obviously this elastic deformation of the sole (1) in<br>
the area corresponding to the sole of the foot is not<br>
obstructed by the classic insole internally covering or by the<br>
upper of the footwear, because both are easily deformable.<br>
Evidently said grooves (5) and (5') affect neither the<br>
waist nor the heel given that these areas of the footwear do<br>
not usually present any problems for people with "wide feet",<br>
in which the excessive width of the feet occurs exactly in the<br>
area corresponding to the sole of the foot.<br>
In view of Figures 3 and 4 it can be seen how the<br>
footwear proposed by the invention is formed, like any<br>
conventional footwear, by means of the combination of a sole<br>
(1) and an upper (2), the latter having a lower inner<br>
perimetral edge (3) for its adaptation and fixing to the sole<br>
(1) by any appropriate means, the classic insole (4) suitably<br>
isolating the user's foot from the sole (1) and which can<br>
optionally be covered by another insole for decorative<br>
purposes, being arranged on the inside of the upper (2).<br>
Complementarily in the upper (2) and also in the area<br>
corresponding to the sole of the footwear, specifically under<br>
the insole (4) , a laminar elastic body (6) is arranged,<br>
suitably fixed at its contour to the upper (2) , for example,<br>
to the previously mentioned perimetral edge (3) , which elastic<br>
body (6) allows and favours deformation in the transverse<br>
direction of the footwear, and which according to a preferred<br>
practical embodiment will be stiffened by means of a<br>
longitudinal band (7) and a pair of transverse end bands (8-<br>
8'), perfectly visible in Figure \, fixed both to the elastic<br>
laminar body (6) and, where appropriate, to the edge (3) of<br>
the upper, these bands (7-8) having the purposes of suitably<br>
stabilizing the elastic body (6), defining therein two<br>
independent side deformation areas.<br>
On the other hand, the thickness of these bands (7-8)<br>
favours the arrangement of the variable volume chamber (9)<br>
between the elastic body (6) and the sole (1) , the volume of<br>
which will decrease when supporting the foot on the ground,<br>
the air exiting said chamber through a plurality of openings<br>
(10) arranged in the bands (7) and (8) with air penetrating<br>
into the useful inside of the footwear, whereas an increase in<br>
the volume of the chamber (9) and an aspirating effect occurs<br>
when lifting the foot from the ground and due to the elastic<br>
recovery of the body (6) .<br>
Therefore, and according to the described structure, the<br>
grooves (5-5') of the sole (1) and the elastomeric nature<br>
thereof, as described, allow the elastic deformation in the<br>
transverse direction of the sole so that the footwear<br>
comfortably adjusts to the user's feet, irrespective of the<br>
width thereof, whilst at the same time the chamber created<br>
between the elastic laminar body (6) and the sole itself,<br>
together with the openings (10) for communicating with the<br>
inside of the footwear, generate a ventilation in the latter,<br>
with a "lung"-type movement of air maximally increasing the<br>
comfort of the footwear as a whole.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
