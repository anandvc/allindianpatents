1<br><br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to a storage stable composition of Lambda Cyhalothrin. More particularly it relates to a composition in the form of emulsifiable concentrate by using a dispersant system as a stabilizer for the impurities causing turbidity to the formulation.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Lambda Cyhalothrin is a reaction product comprising equal quantities of (R)-a-cyano-3-<br>
phenoxybenzyl0(lS,3S)-3-[(Z)-2-chloro-3,3,3-trifluoropropenyl]-2,2-dimethylcy<br>
clopropanecarboxylate and (S)-a-cyano-3-phenoxybenzyl (lR,3R)-3-[(Z)-2-chloro-3,3,3-<br>

phenoxyphenyl)methyl	(15,,35)-re/-3-[(lZ)-2-chloro-3,3,3-trifluoro-1 -propenyl]-2,2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate. It is used as an insecticide (pyrethroid ester insecticides) and has the chemical structure,<br><br>
"•      <br><br>
Lambda Cyhalothrin is a pyrethroid insecticide registered by the U.S. Envionmental protection Agency (EPA) in 1988. Pyrethroids are synthetic chemicals that are structurally<br>
2<br><br>
similar to the natural insecticides pyrethrins. Scientists developed pyrethroid insecticides to have enhanced biological activity and desired physical and chemical properties relative to pyrethrins.<br>
Lambda Cyhalothrin is similar to the pyrethroid Cyhalothrin. Pyrethroids affect the nervous system of an organism or insects. They act by disrupting the gating mechanism of sodium channels that are involved in the generation and conduction of nerve impulses. Pyrethroid disrupt the sodium channel activation gate by keeping it in open position. Delayed closing of the gate results in prolonged excitation of nerve fibers, thus causes paralysis and death of the insects.<br>
Cyhalothrin is a mixture of four isomers, and two of these isomers compose Lambda Cyhalothrin. Due to their similarity, researchers sometimes use toxicity tests conducted with Cyhalothrin to evaluate the toxicity of Lambda Cyhalothrin. Lambda Cyhalothrin is a colorless to beige solid that has a mild odor. It has a low water solubility and is nonvolatile.<br>
Technical Cyhalothrin is a mixture of 4 isomers. 1) A   pair   of  enantiomers:   (Z(l   R)<br>
cis(R)alpha-CN and Z(l S) cis(S)alpha-CN) 2)B pair of enantiomers: (Z(l R) cis (S)alpha-<br>
CN and Z(l S) cis(R)alpha-CN. The enantiomers are present in equal amounts within each<br>
pair.<br>
Lambda -Cyhalothrin consists entirely of the B pair of enantiomers.<br><br>

US patent 5334744 teaches the preparation of Lambda -Cyhalothrin from Cyhalothrin. Cyhalothrin (105 g), wet isopropanol containing 8.0% w/w water (270 g), sodium cyanide (6.5 g), and crystalline Lambda -Cyhalothrin are charged to a 1-liter glass vessel fitted with a twin turbine glass agitator and a cooling jacket and maintained at a temperature of -5° C by circulation of a cooled mixture of water and ethylene glycol with agitation for a period of 24 and 48 hours after which the ratio of Isomer Pair B / Isomer Pair A was determined by a gas chromatographic technique and it was 96.1 to 96.4.<br>
Effect of pH on isomerization and hydrolysis of Lambda Cyhalothrin have been studied and it has been observed that hydrolysis of Lambda -Cyhalothrin occurs rapidly at a pH of 9 and isomerization of Lambda Cyhalothrin is observed at a pH of 7. No hydrolysis or isomerization was seen at a pH of 5 (See table 1).<br>
"Salt of amine" is a commonly known impurity in Lambda Cyhalothrin technical. This is a colloidal impurity that imparts turbidity to the product when formulated in a liquid form and this impurity is not separable even after filtration.<br>
In the process of crystallization of Lambda Cyhalothrin, amines are used as epimerization agents. After completion of epimerization-crystallization, these amines are neutralized with acids like acetic acid and results in forming their corresponding salts before filtration of Lambda Cyhalothrin crystals. Although, the cake during filtration is washed, and some quantity of salts of amine with acid may remain along with the crystals of Lambda Cyhalothrin. This salt being solvent-insoluble separates out when Lambda Cyhalothrin Technical is dissolved in aromatic solvents during formulation thus causing the problem of haziness and sedimentation.<br>
The inventors tried various attempts to separate these impurities. One of the traditional techniques of removing these impurities is by using filtration. Filtration can be done using cloth or using filter having submicron pore size 1-15 micron, but repeated filtration by this technique causes chocking problem. The cloth filtration also involves excess handling of the finished product.<br>
4<br><br>
Cellulose filtration is yet another technique of filtration but repeated filter choking problem arises in this process, and the final product on storage generates haziness. Cellulose filtration is also very expensive.<br>
Scientists have also tried techniques of removing these amine impurities using co-solvent technique. It has been observed that use of N-butanol in concentration range of about 1-5% by weight of the product initially gives a clear liquid composition of Lambda, but on storage the composition becomes hazy. When used N-Methyl pyrrolidone as a co-solvent in the range of about 1 -5 % by weight of the product also gives a clear solution , but on storage the formulation changes its color. Use of N-Methyl pyrrolidone also leads to degradation and enantiomeric transformation.<br>
Water is a universal solvent and known to dissolve the salt impurities faster. When water is used as a solvent in the concentration range of 0.1 to 5 % by weight it gives a clear solution, but at higher dose of Lambda Cyhalothrin it gives haziness to the product and also shows product degradation if there is a slight pH alteration on stability. Lambda Cyhalothrin is having a melting point 47.5 degrees to 48.5 degrees. In the process of removing impurities from the technical by water washing, final product needs to be dried. This drying is carried out strictly below 47.5 to 48.5 degrees and drying the product at this temperature is very difficult as it takes long hours to dry Lambda Cyhalothrin.<br>
The pH modification is yet another technique for stabilizing Lambda Cyhalothrin by dissolving the impurities and for stabilizing active isomer. The pH modification can be done using organic acids like Glacial Acetic acid. But the resultant product on storage generates haziness and shows colour change. When Isopropyl phosphate is used as a pH modifier, the final product on storage generates haziness and imparts color change to the final product.<br>
When pH is modified using inorganic acids like hydrochloric acid, phosphoric acid, or sulphuric acid to lower its pH to about 5.5 in order to arrest the enantiomeric transformation of Lambda, two clear observations were made namely (1) formation of a cloudy material which is sub-colloidal in nature and is extremely difficult to filter even with a 0.1-5.0 micron mesh, and (2) color of the formulation changes from light yellow to dark brown.<br>
5<br><br>
So, there exists a need within the art for a storage stable composition that will not have enantiomeric changes on storage and which will maintain its aesthetic appeal by overcoming the problem of impurity interference.<br>
Thus the challenge involved in developing commercially acceptable products containing agriculturally active compounds continues to increase. So there is a need in the art to develop a stable and clear system having no problem of haziness. The final product is storage stable and the supplied product can be diluted at the time of application as per requirements.<br>
It is yet another need in the art for developing new dispersant systems that help in developing Lambda Cyhalothrin emulsion concentrate that is storage stable, and devoid of any enantiomeric transformation or any physicochemical (instability. The invention described below in details is directed to this, as well as other, important ends.<br>
The inventors of this invention have surprisingly found that addition of small amount 0.1-10.0 % of the Tristrylphenol Phosphate Ester which is a polar surfactant and not generally used in emulsifiable concentrate compositions resulted in not only lowering the pH and lowering the turbidity in the final formulation formed due to amine salt impurity. The final composition is not only chemically stable, but also helps in controlling the enantiomeric transformation in the final product. The final liquid composition of Lambda Cyhalothrin is also found physically stable and there is no change in color or clarity even on storage.<br>

Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a dispersant system comprising at least one ethoxylated polyaryl phenol phosphate ester such as Tristrylphenol phosphate ester which is acidic in nature and at least one pyrethroid compound as agricultural active such as Lambda Cyhalothrin in the form of emulsifiable concentrate.<br>
Further aspect of the invention is to dissolve the amine impurities in an insecticidal composition in the presence of organic solvent.<br>

In one more aspect of the invention tristrylphenol phosphate ester is selected as ethoxylated polyaryl phenol phosphate ester in an amount of 0.1-2% w/w in the said composition.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to formulate a storage stable composition that does not show any enantiomeric transformation and no color change on storage.<br>

phosphate ester helps in overcoming the problem of colloidal impurity such as "salt of amine" in pyrethroids compounds .<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
It has been found that a dispersant system of acidic Tristrylphenol phosphate ester described herein in this specification is an ethoxylated polyaryl phenol phosphate ester which helps in achieving an emulsifiable concentrate of pyrethroids compound such as Lambda Cyhalothrin, which is physicochemically stable.<br>
The inventors have found that addition of 0.1%-10.0% w/w of acidic Tristrylphenol phosphate ester results in the lowering the pH of the final composition and surprisingly the turbidity in the formulation due to amine salt is also diminished. The final compostion is not only chemically stable due to lowering the pH with the help of Tristrylphenol phosphate ester which helps in maintaining the desired pH in the range of 4-6 by controlling enantiomeric transformation (see the table 1) but also found physically stable as there is no change in color even on storage.<br>

(Remarks: As per above results it is seen that Lambda Cyhalothrin Isomer ratio A : B (B is the active Lambda Cyhalothrin) is more stable in between pH range 4 to 6 )<br>
8<br><br>
The inventors of this invention have observed that while formulating Lambda Cyhalothnn emulsifiable concentrate, the resultant formulation is turbid as a result of the amine salt impurity which is commonly present in the technical and which interferes with the clarity of the final product. This formed turbidity is colloidal in nature and very difficult to filter. Yet another problem inventors have observed is that maintaining the pH of the formulation is very critical and it has to be between 4-6. Slightest variation in the pH is resulting in the enantiomer transfer and color change of the final product.<br>
Colloidal impurities are difficult to filter. Presence of these impurities and their separation by filtration unnecessary adds up to the additional processing step during manufacturing which is time consuming and tidious.<br>
Inorganic acids like hydrochloric acid, phosphoric acid, and sulphuric acid, acetic acid are also tried to lower the pH of the composition to about 5.5 in order to arrest the enantiomeric transformation of Lambda Cyhalothrin composition. Altering the pH of Lambda Cyhalothrin composition is also tried using organic acid like Glacial Acetic acid. But the two major problems associated with this methodology is that the product on storage changes its color and there is enantiomer transformation. Once the enantiomer transforms the product loses its activity. [Refer table 3]<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, inventors have surprisingly found that use of Tristrylphenol phosphate ester having acidic pH in the composition enhances the physicochemical stability of the product.<br>
In further aspect, this invention provides findings that when Tristrylphenol phosphate ester having acid pH is used in the concentration of 0.1%-10.0% w/w helps in maintaining the desired pH in the range of 4-6 which is essential to avoid the enantiomeric transformation changes but also found physically stable as there is no change in color even on storage.<br>
The Tristrylphenol phosphate ester is used in the composition of the invention in an amount of about 0.1 to 10 % w/w, preferably in an amount of about 0.5-5 % w/w.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, Lambda Cyhalothrin active ingredient comprises about 0.1-50% by weight of the total weight of the composition.<br>
9<br><br>
Without being bound by theory, it is believed that Tristrylphenol phosphate ester having acidic pH which acts as a dispersant by the way of dispersion and reducing the surface tension. Its acidic nature helps in maintaining the pH of the formulation between 4 to 6, which is essential to avoid the enantiomeric transformation and thus imparts the physicochemical stability to the product. It has been observed that the shelf life of the composition has improved due to use of Tristrylphenol phosphate ester.<br>
