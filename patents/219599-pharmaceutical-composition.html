PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITION<br>
The present invention is concerned with topical immunotherapy and compositions suitable for use therein.<br>
Topical immunotherapy can be used to describe topical treatment with an agent having immunomodulatory properties. Recently, topical formulations including agents with direct immunosuppressive actions have been tested in diseases believed to have an immunological   basis,   especially   atopic   dermatitis   and   psoriasis.       These   topical immunosuppressive agents have included tacrolimus, asomycin and cyclosporin and their derivatives, and other structurally related macrolide topical immunosuppressants.<br>
Tacrolimus is a hydrophobic macrolide immunosuppressant produced by Streptomyces tsukubaensis No. 9993. Tacrolimus, 17-allyl-l,14-dihydroxy-12-[2-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxycyclohexyl)-l-methylvinyl]-23,25-dimethoxy,-13,19,21,27-tetramethyl-<br>
11,28-dioxa-4-azatricyclo[22.3.1.04-9]octacos-18-ene-2,3,10,16-tetraone, which is also known as FK-506 or FR-900506, has the following structural formula:<br><br><br>
WO 2004/071398	PCT/GB2004/000584<br>
3<br>
Tacrolimus inhibits T-lymphocyte activation by first binding to an intracellular protein, FKBP-12.  A complex of tacrolimus-FKBP-12, calcium, cadmodulin and calcineurin is then formed and the phosphatase activity of calcineurin is inhibited.  The effect has been t shown to prevent the dephosphorylation and translocation of nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NF-AT), a nuclear component thought to initiate gene transcription for the formation of lymphokines (such as interleukin-2, gamma interferon).    Tacrolimus also inhibits the transcription for genes which encode IL-3, IL-4, TL-5, GM-CSF and TNF-alpha, all of which are involved in the early stages of T-cell activation.   Tacrolimus inhibits proliferation and selective cytokine expression in antigen stimulated T cells in culture and also inhibits B cell proliferation at similar concentrations.<br>
More particularly, tacrolimus inhibits T-lymphocyte activation, having a direct effect on T-lymphocytes so as to inhibit JL-2 transcription, which decreases responsiveness of T-lymphocytes to foreign antigens.   The action of tacrolimus on atopic dermatitis may be related to alteration of antigen presenting cells, suppression of TL-2 and co-stimulatory molecule expression, impairment of phenotypic and functional differentiation of epidermal Langerhans' cells and suppression of Thl and Th2 cytokine induction in lymph node cells. The effect of tacrolimus on pruritis may be related to inhibition of histamine release from skin mast cells and impairment of de novo mast cell prostaglandin D2 synthesis along with diminished release of histamine from basophiles.   It has also been reported that in atopic dermatitis patients, tacrolimus does not alter collagen synthesis and it not atrophogenic.<br>
Tacrolimus is available in both intravenous and oral formulation for the prevention of organ rejection after allogeneic liver or kidney transplantation. Oral tacrolimus has been found to be useful in the treatment of psoriasis, but potentially serious side effects, such as nephrotoxicity and hypertension, has limited its use for dermatologic indications by this route of administration. Topical formulations (ointments) have been extensively studied and reported to show positive effects in treatment of inflammatory skin diseases, such as atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. Tacrolimus administered topically (as an ointment) has been reported to be safe and effective in the treatment of skin diseases.<br>
Ascomycin is the fermentation product of Streptomyces hygroscopic var. ascomyticvs. It includes SDZASM 981, ABT-281 and SDZ-240. These are effective against psoriasis, allergic contact dermatitis and atopic dermatitis, and their mechanism of action is similar to tacrolimus.<br><br>
WO 2004/071398	PCT/GB2004/000584<br>
Cyclosporin is a neutral cyclic peptide composed of 11 amino acids. It acts by inhibiting interleukin-2 (TL-2) production by activated CD4+ T cells. Impaired IL-2 production leads to a decline in the number of activated CD4 and CD 8 cells in the epidermis. It is most effective against psoriasis, but also has efficacy against atopic dermatitis, lichen planus, pemphigus, epidermolysis bullosa acquisata, dermatomyositis, scleredema, pyoderma gangrenosa, contact dermatitis and other dermatological disorders.<br>
The following prior art patent documents describe known tacrolimus formulations -US 2002173516, US 2002052407, US 2002013340, EP 1092429, US 6187756, US 6184248, EP 1067926, HU 0000587 and WO 98/09523.<br>
US 2002052407, US 6187756, US 6184248 and WO 98/09523 describe compositions of tacrolimus for use in neurological disorders and neurogenerative diseases.<br>
EP 1092429 discusses pharmaceutical compositions and methods for treating immune response associated disorders.<br>
US 2002173516 and 2002013340 describe pharmaceutical compositions and methods for treating immune response associated diseases of the surface and anterior segment of the eye.<br>
EP 1067926 and WO 99/51215 describe the use of tacrolimus as showing inhibitory activity on the production of nitric oxide.<br>
WO 02/092031, US 6492427 and EP 0547229 disclose topical formulations that employ cyclosporin for the treatment of alopecia, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, multiple sclerosis and other dermatological disorders.<br>
US 5925649 discloses preparation of ascomycin and a topical formulation thereof to be used as creams, lotion, emulsion, transdermal patch, cataplasm, plaster and gels. WO 00/32234 discloses an ointment of ascomycin along with a hydrocarbon and a fatty alcohol or a fatty oil.<br>
Transdermal systemic drug delivery provides an effective method of achieving improved bioavailability for physiologically active substances. Transdermal drug formulations stabilized with polymers form an appreciable surface mass on the skin, which can be retained on the skin over a prolonged duration of many hours. Transdermal delivery<br>
of such drugs can also be achieved by a metered dose transdermal spray so that a fixed amount of drug can be delivered per actuation, thus maintaining dose therapeutics.<br><br>
WO 2004/071398	PCT/GB2004/000584<br>
US 6455066 discloses a patch comprising a backing and a pressure sensitive acrylic adhesive, the adhesive comprising a therapeutically effective amount of lidocaine, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and a penetration enhancing amount of soybean oil for administration of anesthesia.<br>
US 5540931 discloses a formulation for treatment of skin proliferative disorders by topical administration of an immunosuppressant, such as tacrolimus, in a suitable carrier, such as an oily vehicle. Although a patch is referred to as an alternative transdermal delivery mode, no specific enabling disclosure of such a patch for an immunosuppressant is provided. US   6190691   and  US  6224901   respectively describe  formulations   comprising cyclosporin as an anti-inflammatory agent and to increase the growth of hair follicles for treating alopecia.<br>
Although it is well known in the prior art that tacrolimus, ascomycin and cyclosporins have been used for topical immune therapy, there has been a need for an improved dosage form that could enable the transfer of drugs in a more effective manner. Other topical dosage forms, such as emulsions, ointments, creams and lotions, which are specifically described and as such enabled by the prior art, require direct application to the skin surface and a prolonged contact time for therapeutic efficacy, thus resulting in decreased bioavailability and patient compliance. Furthermore, these dosage forms can also be sticky and oily in nature, thus discouraging reuse thereof by a patient.<br>
There is, however, provided by the present invention a patch, or patch forming composition, comprising at least one immunosuppressant, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate or physiologically functional derivative thereof, together with a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable carrier or excipient therefor, formulated for delivery of said at least one immunosuppressant, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate or physiologically functional derivative thereof, to the skin of a patient.<br>
The use of such a patch, or patch forming composition, as provided by the present invention can be advantageous in alleviating many of the above described problems hitherto associated with topical formulations as provided in the prior art. For example, the application<br>
time for a patch is considerably reduced compared to other topical compositions and also penetration of the drug molecule through the skin is faster than with other conventional topical dosage forms.   The transdermal route of delivery, and thus the faster rate of drag<br><br><br>
transfer, increases the bioavailability of the drug. Therefore, the shorter contact time, ease of application and better therapeutic efficacy, can result in increased patient compliance.<br>
A patch, or patch forming composition, for use according to the present invention can comprise a spray-on patch, a transdermal patch, a physical patch or a controlled release patch. In the case where a spray-on patch is provided by the present invention, this can be advantageous in that the at least one immunosuppressant, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate or physiologically functional derivative thereof, to be delivered thereby may be administered in a metered dose.<br>
An immunosuppressant suitable for use in a patch, or patch forming composition, according to the present invention, is preferably selected from the group consisting of tacrolimus, cyclosporin, ascomycin, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate or physiologically functional derivative thereof.<br>
The term "physiologically functional derivative" as used herein denotes a chemical derivative of an immunosuppressant as described herein having the same or similar physiological function as the free base immunosuppressant and, for example, being<br>
convertible in the body thereto.<br>
The immunosuppressant active ingredient is typically included in a patch, or patch forming composition, according to the present invention at a concentration in the range of 0.1 wt% to 5 wt% of the total patch composition.<br>
Suitably a patch, or patch forming composition, according to the present invention may include a combination of pharmaceutically acceptable polymers present in the composition so as to modulate delivery to the skin of the at least one immunosuppressant substantially as hereinbefore described. Typically the combination of polymers can achieve substantially controlled delivery of the at least one immunosuppressant.<br>
Preferably a patch, or patch forming composition, according to the present invention further comprises one or more of the following: at least one film forming agent, at least one film plasticiser and at least one organic solvent.<br>
The film forming agent suitable for use in a patch, or patch forming composition, according to the present invention can include one or more of the following: poloxamers, acrylic<br>
acid and its derivatives, polyvinyl acetate, polysiloxane, polyacrylic acid and its derivatives such as polybutylmethacrylate, polymethacrylic  acid and polymethacrylate, ascorbyl palmitate,<br>
