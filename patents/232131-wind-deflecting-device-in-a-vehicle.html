				<td>[DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION) [0001]<br>
[Field of the Invention]<br>
The present invention relates to a wind deflecting device in a vehicle such as a motorcycle. <br>
[0002]<br>
[Prior Art]<br>
Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 7-246973 discloses an icing prevention structure having an intake cover for blocking pass of a wind through an engine upper space defined between an engine and a fuel tank, thereby preventing a cold wind from coming into direct contact with a carburetor provided behind a cylinder of the engine. [0003]<br>
[Problem to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
In the above icing prevention structure, however, the intake cover operates as a wall for receiving the wind tending to pass through the engine upper space, so that there is a possibility of increase in running resistance.<br>
[0004]<br>
[Means of Solving the Problem]<br>
According to the present invention, there is provided in a vehicle including a motorcycle having a body frame, an engine supported to said body frame, a fuel tank provided above said engine, and a carburetor provided behind a cylinder of said engine, wherein an engine upper space is defined between said engine and said fuel tank so as to extend from a front portion of said body frame toward said carburetor; a wind deflecting device comprising a wind deflector plate having a louver provided on the front side of said engine upper space for deflecting and guiding a wind to the front side of said engine. [0005]<br>
In this configuration, the wind deflector plate may be secured to the body frame together with a horn provided before the engine.  In securing the wind deflector plate, the wind deflector plate may be temporarily fixed to a down frame provided before the engine by temporarily fixing means. [0006]<br>
Further, in securing the horn, a mounting position of the horn to the body frame may be determined by positioning means.<br>
[0007]<br>
[Effect of the Invention]<br>
Since the wind deflector plate is provided on the front side of the engine upper space, the wind is deflected and guided by the louver of the wind deflector plate to reach the front side of the engine. [0008]<br>
Accordingly, engine cooling efficiency by the wind can be unproved.  Further, pass of the wind through the engine upper space can be suppressed to thereby prevent using of the carburetor.  Simultaneously, the wind is deflected and guided smoothly by the wind deflector plate, thereby minimizing running resistance. [0009]<br>
In the case that the wind deflector plate is secured to the body frame together with the horn, a Mounting structure can be simplified. [0010]<br>
In the case that the wind deflector plate is temporarily fixed to the body frame by the temporarily fixing means, the above securing operation for the wind deflector plate can be made easy. (0011]<br>
In the case that the horn is positioned to the body<br>
frame by the positioning means the horn can be  mounted more easily and accurately.<br>

the main frame 10.  The rear ends of the seat rails 15 are<br>
connected to upper portions of the rear stays 14.<br>
[0017]<br>
The rear stays 14 are bent in the vicinity of their portions connected to the seat rails 15 to further extend substantially horizontally rearward.  A pair of right and left grab rails 16 are mounted on the outer side surfaces of the rear horizontal portions of the rear stays 14 by means of mounting members 17.  A pair of right and left subframes 18 extend rearward from the rear ends of the rear horizontal portions of the rear stays 14.

The main frame 10, the down frames 11, the lower frames 12, the pivot frames 13, the seat rails 15, and the rear stays 14 constitute a body frame.  Of these frame components, the main frame 10, the down frames 11, the lower frames 12, and the seat rails 15 constituting a front portion of the body frame form a cradle frame structure. An engine 20 is supported within this frame structure. [0019]<br>
The engine 20 intakes the outside air from an air cleaner (not shown) provided within a pair of right and<br>
left side covers 22 through a carburetor 21, and exhausts combustion gases from an exhaust pipe 23 through a pair of light and left mufflers 24. [0020]<br>

A fuel tank 34 is supported to the main frame 10. A dashboard 35 including various indicators and meters xs provided on the upper surface of the fuel tank 34 at xts front portion.  A rider's seat 36 is supported to the seat rails 15 behind the fuel tank 34.<br>
I 0023]<br>
A passenger's seat 37 is supported on a rear cowl 38 behind the rider's seat 36, and a backrest 39 is provided behind the passenger's seat 37.  A backrest support member 4 0 for supportxng the backrest 3 9 is supported at its lower ends to the grab rails 16. [0024]<br>
A rear fender 41 is mounted to a lower portion of the rear cowl 38.  A taillight 4 2 and a mudguard 4 3 are mounted on the rear fender 41 at xts rear end portion.  The rear cowl 38 is supported to the subfraxnes 18. [0025]<br>
Reference numerals 45, 46, and 47 denote a paxr of right and left front footrests, a brake pedal, and a gearshift pedal, respectively.  These parts are located below and before the engine 20 to allow a rider to take a custom motorcycle-like riding position such that the rider's legs are stretched forward. [0026]<br>
The motorcycle further includes a side stand 48, a pair of right and left rear footrests 49, a wheel 50 formed of light alloy, a brake disk 51, a brake caliper 52, a front fender 53, a headlight 54, a pair of right and left front turn signals 55, a pair of right and left horns 56,<br><br>
and a pair of right and left side covers 57 for covering the right and left sides of an upper portion of a cylinder 61 of the engine 20. [0027]<br>
A pair of right and left side gusset plates 58 are provided to cover the right and left sides of a space surrounded by the head pipe 5, the main frame 10, and the down frames 11.  Rear portions of the side gusset plates 58 overlap the inner surfaces of the fuel tank 34 and the front side covers 57 at their front portions.  Reference numeral 59 denotes a reinforcing pipe. [0028]<br>
As shown in FIG. 10, an engine upper space 62 is defined between a bottom portion 60 of the fuel tank 34 and the cylinder 61 of the engine 20.  The engine upper space 6 2 is separated into front and rear spaces by means of a partition wall 63. [0029]<br>
The engine upper space 62 is a longitudinally elongated space extending from near the upper portions of the down frases 11 to the surrounding of the carburetor 21 located behind the cylinder 61. [0030]<br>
The right and left sides of the engine upper space<br>
62 are covered with the right and left lower portions of the fuel tank 34, the front side covers 57, and the side gusset plates 58. [0031]<br>
The front side covers 57 cover the right and left sides of an upper portion of the cylinder 61, and the upper ends of the front sxde covers 57 abut against the lower ends of the right and left lower portions of the fuel tank 34. [0032]<br>
There will now be described a wind deflecting structure provided before the engine 20 in detail.  As apparent from FIGS. 1 and 4 to 9, the pair of right and left down frames 11 extend downward from the lower portion of the head pipe 5. [0033]<br>
A space between the right and left down frames 11 is partially covered with a stiffener plate 65 and a wind deflector plate 66.  The wind deflector plate 66 is located below the stiffener plate 65.  Such a covered area of the space between the down frames 11 corresponds to a front portion of the engine upper space 62. [0034]<br>
An upper portion of the wind deflector plate 66 is<br>
mounted to a lower portion of the stiffener plate 65 by means of two pairs of shoulder bolts 68 and nuts 69 (see FIG. 5).  A pair of horn stays 67 are also mounted at their upper end portions to the lower portion of the stiffener plate 65 by means of the shoulder bolts 68 and the nuts 69. [0035]<br>
As apparent from FIG. 6, the stiffener plate 65 is a substantially triangular member obtained by pressing or the like of an iron plate.  A pair of through holes 71 for allowing insertion of small-diameter portions of the shoulder bolts 68 and a pair of positioning projections 72 are formed in the vicinity of a lower end 7 0 of the stiffener plate 65.  The through holes 71 and the positioning projections 72 are located in symmetry with respect to a vertical center line.  The nuts 69 are welded to the stiffener plate 65 at the peripheries of the through holes 71. [0036]<br>
A pair of right and left arcuate side portions 73 of the stiffener plate 65 are fitted with the outer circumferential surfaces of the down frames 11 and welded thereto.  A pair of upper end portions 74 of the stiffener plate 65 are welded to the outer circumferential surface of the head pipe 5 at its lower portion.  Reference numeral 75<br>
denotes a lock plate for locking the handle bar 6. [0037]<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, the stiffener plate 65 mounted on the head pipe 5 and the down frames 11 is positioned so that the upper end portion of the stiffener plate 65 is inclined frontward.  Accordingly, the front inclined surface of the stiffener plate 65 functions as a kind of wind deflecting member and wind guiding member for deflecting and guiding a wind W toward the lower side of the stiffener plate 65. [0038]<br>
The wind deflector plate 66 is a resin member.  As shown in FIG. 8, the wind deflector plate 66 is mounted so as to cover a front portion of the engine upper space 62, and has a height such that a lower portion of the wind deflector plate 66 overlaps an upper portion of the cylinder 61 as viewed in front or rear elevation. [0039]<br>
An upper end portion 80 of the wind deflector plate 66 is formed with a pair of bosses 81.  Each boss 81 has a through hole 82 for allowing insertion of a large-diameter portion of each shoulder bolt 68.  Most of the wind deflector plate 66 below the upper end portion 80 is formed as a plurality of louvers 83 horizontally elongated and<br>
vertically arranged in parallel. [0040]<br>
The uppermost louver 83 is formed with a pair of slits 84 cut from opposite side edges 86 toward the vertical center line.  The horn stays 67 are secured at their upper end portions together with the wind deflector plate 66 to the stiffener plate 65, and lower portions of the horn stays 67 are passed through the slits 84 to project to the front side of the wind deflector plate 66. [0041]<br>
All the louvers 83 are spaced in parallel at given intervals 85 and inclined down at their rear portions to introduce the wind W to the front side of the engine 20, especially the cylinder 61. [0042]<br>
A plurality of front hooks 87 and rear hooks 88 project sideways from the opposite side edges 86 of the wind deflector plate 66 in such a manner as to be vertically spaced at suitable intervals in an alternate fashion. [0043]<br>
As shown in FIG. 9, each front hook 87 is arcuately curved frontward of the wind deflector plate 66 so as to be just fitted with about 1/4 of the circular length of the<br>
outer circumference of each down frame 11.  Each rear hook 88 is similarly arcuate except that it is curved rearward of the wind deflector plate 66. [0044]<br>
Accordingly, the wind deflector plate 66 can be temporarily fixed to the down frames 11 by elastically deforming the front hooks 87 and the rear hooks 88 and fitting them with the down frames 11. [0045]<br>
The horn stays 67 for mounting the horns 56 are strip members formed of metal or resin.  As shown in FIG. 4, the pair of horn stays 67 are mounted at their upper end portions in such a manner as to be arranged in a substantially inverted V-shape.  As apparent from FIG. 5, the upper end portion of each horn stay 67 is formed with a through hole 76 for allowing insertion of the small-diameter portion of each shoulder bolt 68, and further formed with a positioning hole 77 in the vicinity of the through hole 76 for engaging the corresponding positioning projection 72 of the stiffener plate 65. [0046]<br>
The operation of this preferred embodiment will now be described.  In mounting the wind deflector plate 66 to the vehicle body, the front and rear hooks 87 and 88 formed<br>
at the opposite side edges 86 are elastically deformed to be fitted with the down frames 11, thereby temporarily fixing the wind deflector plate 66 to the down frames 11. [0047]<br>
Then, the upper portions of the horn stays 67 are inserted through the slits 84 to be located on the rear side of the wind deflector plate 66.  In the condition that the through holes 71, 76, and 82 are aligned, the shoulder bolts 68 are inserted through these holes 71, 76, and 82 and tightened with the nuts 69, thereby securing the wind deflector plate 66 and the horn stays 67 together to the stiffener plate 65. [0048]<br>
That is, the wind deflector plate 66 and the horns 56 can be mounted together by the common shoulder bolts 68. Accordingly, the mounting structure and operation can be simplified, and the number of parts can be reduced. [0049]<br>
Further, since the wind deflector plate 66 is temporarily fixed to the down frames 11, an operator's hand can be removed from the wind deflector plate 66 during the above mounting operation using the shoulder bolts 68. Accordingly, the mounting operation for the horn stays 67 can be performed with both hands of the operator, thereby<br>
making the operation easy. [0050]<br>
Further, in mounting the horn stays 67, the angle defined between the horn stays 67 arranged in the inverted V-shape can be accurately determined by engaging the positioning projections 72 of the stiffener plate 65 into the positioning holes 77 of the horn stays 67. Accordingly, the positioning of the horns 56 can be performed easily and accurately. [0051]<br>
During running of the motorcycle on which the wind deflector plate 66 is mounted, the wind W passes over the front fender 53 toward the front side of the engine 20.  A part of the wind W directed to the stiffener plate 65 is blocked by the stiffener plate 65 to be prevented from entering the engine upper space 62 because this space 62 is covered at its upper front portion with the stiffener plate 65.  Accordingly, this part of the wind W is guided obliquely downward along the inclined stiffener plate 65. [0052]<br>
Further, a part of the wind W directed to the wind deflector plate 66 located so as to cover a front lower portion of the engine upper space 62 is deflected by the louvers 83 to enter the front side of the engine 20,<br>
especially the cylinder 61, thereby cooling the engine 20. [0053]<br>
Further, since the right and left sides of the engine upper space 62 are covered with the fuel tank 34, the front side covers 57, and the side gusset plates 58, the wind W hardly enters the engine upper space 62. [0054]<br>
Even if the wind W enters the engine upper space 62, the wind W is prevented from reaching a rear portion of the engine upper space 62 because of the partition wall 63 provided in the engine upper space 62.  Accordingly, there is almost no possibility that the wind W may pass over the cylinder 61 and reach the carburetor 21 located behind the cylinder 61. [0055]<br>
As a result, icing of the carburetor 21 can be prevented.  Simultaneously, running resistance can be minimized and engine cooling efficiency can be improved, because the wind W is deflected and guided to the engine 20 by the stiffener plate 65 and the wind deflector plate 66. [0056]<br>
It should be noted that the present invention is not limited to the above preferred embodiment, but various changes may be made.  For example, the stiffener plate 65<br>
is not essential, but the wind deflector plate 66 may be solely used according to the front opening area of the engine upper space 62.  Further, the pair of right and left down frames 11 may be replaced by a single down frame provided along the longitudinally extending center line of the vehicle body.  In addition, the present invention is applicable not only to the motorcycle, but also to similar vehicles such as a three-wheeled motor vehicle.<br>
