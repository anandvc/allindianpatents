MESSAGING SYSTEMS<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to messaging systems and particularly to features of-messaging systems that enhance the utility of such a system.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Numerous messaging techniques exist, including electronic mail systems (e-mail) and voice messaging (voice mail) systems. However, existing systems rely on a user being able to contact the messaging system service and interact with a service.  For example, if a phone company supports voice messaging, the user is advised of the arrival of a voice message only when he or she checks with the relevant service to find out if such a voice message has been received.<br>
United States patent no. 5,434,907 issued July 18, 1995 to Hurstel et al describes a voice mail notification system.  A message count, representing the number of pending voice mail messages for telecommunication service subscriber, is updated and the subscriber is automatically notified.<br>
United States patent no. 6,091,947 issued July 18, 2000 to Summer describes a wireless messaging system used to determine when link performance is inadequate for a live connection, so that the voice call can be rediverted to a voice message box. A wireless base unit conveys the accepted voice mail to a mobile handset using a store and forward protocol. The mobile handset stores the conveyed voice mail message for playback by the user.<br>
United States patent no. 5,802,466 issued September 1, 1998 to Gallant et al describes a system in which a voice mail messaging center directs a call to a voice mailbox associated with a mobile communication device, to record a message when the mobile communication device is unable to receive the call. The voice mail messaging center optimizes communication from the messaging center to the mobile communication device by sending a first message indicator to the mobile communication device when a voice mail is recorded and the voice mailbox contains no messages.<br>
United States patent no. 5,768,683 issued June 16, 1998 to Mulford describes a method for automatic re-transmission of voice messages by a mobile communication unit.  An identification code is continuously<br><br>
embedded in the voice mail message and, where this code matches that stored in the mobile communication unit, retransmitting the voice mail message after a predetermined period of time.<br>
United States patent no. 5,577,103 issued November 19, 1996 to Foti describes a method of providing service information to subscribers in a cellular telecommunications network using the short message service.  A subscriber in a cellular telephone network is provided with information via SMS, from a subscriber service profile. The service profile information is appended to a short message service (SMS) message which is transmitted from a mobile switching center to a mobile station.<br>
United States patent no. 5,684,862 issued November 4, 1997 to Finnigan describes a voice message store and forward service.  This reference describes a method of conveying a voice message between an originating voice message system and a destination voice message system employing a different set of features. The described system is limited to providing the mechanism for storing and forwarding voice messages.<br>
United States patent no 5,884,160 issued March 16, 1999 to Kanazaki describes a mechanism to temporarily store voice mail message from callers in correspondence with called mobile terminals when the called mobile terminals are in a "communication disabled" state. This reference also describes a method of notifying at least one of the called mobile terminals to receive voice mail messages stored in the message storing means that are destined for the called mobile terminals.<br>
United States patent no. 6,097,962 issued August 1, 2000 to Corriveu et al describes a method of handling SMS messages in a radio telecommunications network when an originating mobile station-based Short Message Entity (MS-SME) sends a SMS origination message while operating in a Mobile Switching (MSC) and then moves into a second MSC before the MS-SME receives a SMS acknowledgment message.<br>
United States patent no 6, 125,281 issued September 26, 2000 to Wells et al. describes a real-time SMS application messaging using a SMSC-linked server.  This reference describes a method of operating a wireless mobile station of a type that is capable of bi-directional communication and which has a SMS center.<br><br>
Despite various existing prior art systems, a need clearly exists for a messaging system which at least attempts to address one or more of the limitations of the prior art.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention there is a method of providing a support service for a messaging system, the method comprising the steps of:  a) receiving a message for a user; (b) sending a notification to the user informing the user of receipt of the message; and (c) receiving one or more predetermined directions from the user in response to the notification to the user, each of the directions instructing one or more correspondingly predetermined actions in relation to the message.<br>
Preferably the method provides  for the user to access the message from a first device, and the user receives the notification using one or more second devices different from the first device.<br>
Preferably the method provides  for the user to be connected with a first communications network, and the message is received from a second communications network different from the first communications network.<br>
Preferably the method provides for the predetermined actions to comprise one or more of the following: (i) appending to the message; (ii) deleting the message; (iii) forwarding the message to one or more third parties; (iv) specifying the duration for which the message is to be retained; (v) redirecting the message to an electronic mail address; (vi) redirecting the message to a facsimile machine; and  (vii) printing and delivering the message to a specified address.<br>
Preferably the method provides comprising the steps of:  (i) generating summary information based on the content of the message; and  (ii) including the summary information in the notification to the user.<br>
Viewed from another aspect the present invention provides for a messaging system comprising: (a) means for receiving a message for a user; (b) means for sending a notification to the user informing the user of receipt of the message; and (c) means for receiving one or more predetermined directions from the user in response to the notification to the user, each of the directions instructing one or more correspondingly predetermined actions in relation to the message.<br><br>
viewed from another aspect the present invention provides for a  computer software program, recorded on a medium and capable of execution by computing means able to interpret the computer software program, the computer software program comprising:  (a) software code for receiving a message for a user; (b) software code for sending a notification to the user informing the user of receipt of the message; and  (c) software code for receiving one or more predetermined directions from the user in response to the notification to the user, each of the directions instructing one or more correspondingly predetermined actions in relation to the message.<br>
A messaging system support service advantageously allows various types of messaging systems to send notification alerts to message recipient(s). Recipient(s) can respond to such alerts by sending a message in reply that instructs a predetermined action in relation to the received message. Such messaging support can be provided to messages that are text or multimedia in nature. Network operators can desirably use such a system to facilitate the transmission and reception of messages over a communications network.<br>
In described implementations, the Short Message System (SMS) can be used with Global System for Mobile communication (GSM) cellular telephone networks to send an intelligent alert to a pervasive device (for example, a mobile phone in this case) to send, after a voice message has been delivered, from the sending mobile network to the receiving mobile network's voice mail box for the recipient.<br>
Voice messages are sent between cellular phones and the end recipient is near-instantaneously alerted to the arrival of the voice message. This can provide an economically attractive option for messaging, especially when the cellular phones are in different home networks, and a regular call between the cellular phones would typically incur relatively expensive charges from the caller's and/or receiver's cellular carrier.<br>
The described techniques also apply to other types of messaging systems in which it is desirable that the end-recipient be intelligently and near-instantaneously alerted to the arrival of a message, so that the user can take any one or more of a number of predetermined actions on that message.  Such a feature can maintain or even enhance the value of the received message.<br><br>

Detailed description of the Invention<br>
Fig. 1 provides an overview of the components of a messaging system for which a support service is provided.  The message originator 110 can be a person or an automated system that sends information to another person or system (in a different network, in the example shown in Fig. 1). The message is sent to the sender's network 120, which generates metadata for the message and encodes the message. The encoded message (and the metadata) is sent to the receiving network 130 as a data package consisting of header data (that is, the metadata) and the message.<br>
The receiving network 130 transmits an alert to the pervasive device 140 operated by a receiving person/receiving application 150. As described in further detail below, the receiving person/receiving application 150 can perform a predetermined set of operations on the message without retrieving the message. Such operations include: forwarding the message,<br><br>
archiving the message, deleting the message.etc. The receiving person/receiving application 150 can also retrieve the message from the receiving network 130.<br>
Fig. 2 represents a message 210, of the type referred to above, consisting of a message header 220, and message information 230. The message header 220 contains all required meta-data for the message. This meta-data may include, for example, sender information, receiver or destination information, and other message meta-data. The message information 230 contains the actual information (that is, semantic) content of the message 210 that is passed to the recipient 150.<br>
Fig. 3 represents the steps that occur when a message 210 is transmitted in the messaging system of Fig. 1. In this case, the sending network 120 is a mobile telephony network, the receiving network 130 is also a mobile telephony network, and the message 210 sent is a voice mail message. Each of the steps shown in Fig. 3 is outlined below using the same numbering scheme.<br>
At step 305, the message originator 110 is a mobile phone user. The sender's network 120 (referred to as the transmitting network in this example) is therefore a mobile telephone network.  The user transmits a voice message, via the transmitting communications network 120, directed to the intended receiving user or users 150. The transmitting user 110 may elect to include a subject or text header to indicate the content of the message 210 to the receiving user 150. The transmitting user 110 has the option of specifying whether receiving users 150 can view which other receiving users 150 may have also received the message 210. This option is analogous to the carbon copy {cc)   /  blind copy (be) messaging options typical in email client programs.<br>
At step 310, the message 120 produced by the transmitting user 110 is encoded for transmission by the network operator of the transmitting communications network 120. The transmitting network 120 adds the sender's options and preferences and the sender details as a message 220 header (header data is the metadata of the message). The transmitting network 120 may also convert a part of the voice message 230 to text and add that to the header data 220.<br>
At step 315, the network operator of the transmitting communications network 120 transmits the message 210 to the network operator of the<br><br>
receiving communications network 130 that services the receiving user 150. The message 210 is transmitted through the communications network 130.<br>
At step 320, as an alternative, the transmitting user 110 sends a message directly to a receiving user's network 130, specifying the receiving user's cellular telephone number.<br>
At step 325, a server used in the receiving communications network 130 polls and receives the transmitted message 210 for the receiving user 150 who uses the receiving communications network 130.<br>
At step 330, the network operator for the receiving communications network 130 updates the message box for the receiving user 150. The message 210 may be stored in the message box of the receiving user 150, or stored elsewhere for retrieval by the receiving user 150, either directly or through the message box.<br>
At step 335, the network operator of the receiving communications network 130 sends the receiving user 150 an intelligent alert in the form of a SMS message. The alert consists of the header data 220 of the message 210. Since the message 210 is a voice message, the first few words of the message 210 may be converted into text and transmitted as part of the alert. This message "summary" may be treated as part of the message meta-data. Depending on the instructions of the transmitting user 150 in generating the message 210, the list of other receiving users 150 may also be part of the alert.<br>
At step 340, the receiving user 150 may perform certain actions on  the message 210 using SMS, without actually retrieving the message 210.  The receiving user 150 may also retrieve the message 210 from the receiving communications network 130 using, for example, the public switched telephone network and a regular telephone or facsimile machine.<br>
At step 345, the receiving user 150 can also retrieve the message 210 using an Internet-enabled device via the Internet.<br>
In the above steps, the receiving user 150 may obtain a list of the other receiving users 150 to whom a received message 210 has also been sent, if such an action is permitted by the transmitting user. The receiving user 150 can forward the received message 210 to others using a DTMF-based (that is, touch tone) menu, or by sending appropriate SMS messages. The<br><br>
receiving user 150 may elect to delete a message 210 (based on the text summary of the message) before it is downloaded.<br>
In summary, the receiving user 150 can perform the following actions in relation to a received message 210:<br>
1.	Append to the message 210.<br>
2.	Delete a part of the message 210.<br>
3.	Append one message to another 210.<br>
4.	Specify the time period for which the message 210 is to be retained.<br>
5.	Redirect the message 210 to another location (such as an email address).<br>
6.	Request that a print copy of the message 210 be delivered (such as to a facsimile machine).<br>
7.	Forward the message 210 to another user/ system<br>
Fig. 4 is a flowchart that represents the steps that occur at the receiving communications network when an incoming message is received for a receiving user 150 who uses that communications network 150.<br>
At step 405, the message 210 is received by the receiving communications network 150. The receiving user 150 to whom the message is directed is determined from the message header 220. Receiving user's message box is updated to indicate that the message 210 has been received, in step 410. In step 415, that receiving user 150 is alerted that the message 210 has arrived, and is awaiting collection at the message box. In response, the receiving user 150 can perform various operations, as specified above, in step 420. The billing system for that receiving user 150 is updated accordingly, depending on the charging scheme used, in step 425.<br>
