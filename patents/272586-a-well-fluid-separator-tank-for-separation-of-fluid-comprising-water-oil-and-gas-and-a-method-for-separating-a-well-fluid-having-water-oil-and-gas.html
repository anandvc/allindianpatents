A Well Fluid Separator Tank for Separation of Fluid Comprising Water, Oil and Gas, Use of such a Tanl
The invention relates to a well fluid separator tank for separa¬tion of fluid comprising water, oil and gas.<br>
In the oil industry the production of crude oil involves a mixture of oil, gas and water from subterranean reservoirs. At the well head an initial separation usually takes place in one or more stages to remove additional water and gas before the crude oil is ready to be discharged for export. After the initial separation, the crude oil and the gas may be further purified prior to discharge for refining etc. After further purifica¬tion the water and sand is usually optionally discharged into a suitable recipient such as the sea or into a reservoir.<br>
When maturing oil and gas fields it is often found that the vol¬ume of water accompanying the oil and gas becomes much larger and, consequently, the larger volumes of produced water must be treated at the well head production facility in order to maintain an acceptable pro¬duction rate.<br>
	Further, there is general concern as to the pollution caused by<br>
oil production at sea, particularly when oil production takes place in ar¬eas that are considered environmentally fragile, such as arctic areas or fishing areas. In the oil industry there is a fear that demand for a sig¬nificantly lower outlet limit for oil would make oil production from a<br>
 number of known reservoirs uneconomical if they have to rely on the equipment used at present. Thus, great efforts have been made by the industry and the authorities to find ways to reduce the outlet of oil dur¬ing oil production at affordable prices.<br>
On oil and gas production platforms intended for operation off-<br>
 shore limited space is usually available. Therefore there are very strict constraints on the space available for installation of equipment. An even stricter constraint on space may be encountered if the establishment of production and separation at the sea bed level is considered.<br>
 <br>
In the prior art a number of oil-gas-water separators are known. In US 4,424,068 a separator and a method for separating a mixture of oil, gas and water, such as may be received from an oil-well, is described. The separator is in the form of a vessel divided into sepa¬ration chambers and provided with a number of baffles and a dynamic separator where the incoming mixture changes direction several times. Despite the fact that the separator has been known for several years, it seems not to have been widely used. Further, as the separator com¬prises several chambers and many parts, the maintenance will be time consuming which may lead to a costly stop of oil production.<br>
WO 99/20873 describes a sand trap that may be placed on an oil well in order to remove heavier particles such as sand before further processing of the crude oil. The device has a mouth facing a relatively parrow part of the tank with a spatial connection facing a relatively wid¬ened part of the tank where sand and heavy particles precipitate.<br>
GB 2000054 A discloses a separator in which crude oil is sepa¬rated into liquid and gas in a vessel having a feed inlet disposed tangen-tially so that a downward flowing helix of liquid and an upward flowing helix of gas are formed. The vessel has an upper outlet for gas compris¬ing a pipe extending downward into the vessel from the top thereof. The lower end of the vessel, which is conical is provided with baffles to slow down the helix of liquid and opens into a disengaging chamber for gas still present in the liquid; the gas being vented at and the liquid being discharged over a weir.<br>
Despite the number of known oil-gas-water separators there is still a need for an oil-gas-water separator with improved phase separa¬tion capacity which only requires a minimum of space, which can be continuously operated with a low maintenance requirement and which can be manufactured and operated at moderate price.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide an oil-gas-water separator having an improved separation capacity. Consequently, the present invention relates to a well fluid separator tank for separation of fluid comprising water, oil and gas, and comprising an essentially cylin-<br>
 <br>
drical vertical tank having an upper part and a lower part divided by an upward protruding conical frusta shaped wall, a tangentially arranged inlet for fluid in the upper part of the tank, at least one first outlet in the upper part of the tank, at least one second outlet in the lower part of the tank, and means for calming a stream around the second outlet; said upward protruding conical frusta shaped wall having a first opening at an upper end of said upward protruding conical frusta shaped wall to allow communication between the upper part and the lower part of the tank, which conical frusta shaped wall is fixed to the wall of the tank at a position below the position of the inlet opening and has a second opening at the level of the inlet, and which conical frusta shaped wall has an inclination so that the angle between the wall of the tank and the upper side of the conical frusta shaped wall is in the range between 15° and 70°.<br>
The separator according to the invention has been shown to possess a favourable relationship between size and capacity, which is presumably caused by the formation of a "double vortex" in the separa¬tor. The unique design of the interior of the separator is assumed to generate a flow that promotes the formation of a "double vortex", which again will promote the flotation and phase separation in the separator, and thereby result in a very efficient separation.<br>
The conical frustra shaped wall in connection with the tangen¬tially arranged inlet forces the incoming fluid containing a mixture of water, oil and gas to form a vortex flow in the upper part of the separa¬tor tank.<br>
Moreover, the conical frustra shaped wall is open at the top to allow communication between the upper part and the lower part of the tank. The opening ensures that a vortex flow is also formed in the lower part of the separation tank. Furthermore, the opening allows oil and gas  to accumulate in the upper part of the tank and the water phase to flow downwards into the lower part of the tank.<br>
In the context of the present invention the term well fluid is to be understood in a broad sense as a general term indicating that the<br>
 <br>
fluid is present in a processing systenn associated with treatnnent of a well stream fronn a well head. Well fluid on the one hand comprises the main well stream at the well head, and on the other hand well fluid also comprises the water stream separated off from such a well stream. The present well fluid separator is in particular effective in the cleaning of such a water stream so that the water can be released to the environ¬ment in a clean condition.<br>
The second opening in the conical frustra shaped wall serves to facilitate and enhance the formation of a vortex in the lower part of the separator. To obtain the best effect the second opening is preferably lo¬cated at the level of the inlet.<br>
For further improvement, the second opening is preferably lo¬cated in the conical frusta shaped wall in the vicinity of the inlet, more preferably in such a manner that the incoming flow from the inlet does not directly enter the second opening. Thus, it is preferred that the sec¬ond opening is located just before the inlet zone, so that the incoming fluid will at least circulate almost one time (almost a full turn) around the conical frustra shaped wall before it can enter the second opening and the lower part of the separator. The second opening can be located I in the conical frusta shaped wall in such a way that fluid coming into the separator tank from the inlet will make at least a 300° circular move¬ment in the upper part of the tank before passing through the second opening. This arrangement helps to ensure that a proper vortex forma¬tion takes place in the upper part of the tank, which again will provide for an excellent separation of the different fractions to be separated in the incoming fluids. A diminutive amount of the incoming mixture may unavoidably enter the second opening more or less directly. However, this will have no significant influence on the vortex formation as long as the major part of the incoming mixture is forced around the conical frusta shaped wall in the upper part of the tank before entering the sec¬ond opening.<br>
Although the second opening may have any desired shape, e.g. circular or oval, it is preferred that the second opening is substantially<br>
 <br>
rectangular and that the height and width of the second opening have dimensions in the range from 1 to 2 times the inner diameter of the inlet.<br>
The at least one first outlet (for oil and gas, or for gas) in the upper part of the tank may be arranged to have an ejecting effect. This ejecting effect is achieved by pressure build-up by gas in the upper part of the tank. In particular when the first outlet extends a distance (e.g. 5-30 cm) down into the tank, gas from the mixture comprising water, oil and gas may accumulate in the space in the upper part of the tank defined by the top of the tank and the location of the outlet opening to the first outlet. In such an arrangement a pressure build up will take place by accumulating gas until the gas has displaced the liquid part of the mixture in the tank to a level just below the outlet opening to the first outlet. At this point gas and oil will be ejected through the first out¬let and leave the tank. The level of the liquid mixture will rise to above the outlet for oil and gas and a new pressure build up will take place. In this manner oil is automatically skimmed from the top of the water in the tank. Depending on the location of the outlet opening to the first outlet, the pressure build-up and rejection may take place in less than one second.<br>
The means for calming a flow around the second outlet (for wa¬ter or for oil) can be embodied as a disc with a circular circumference optionally placed horizontally just above the second outlet. As an alter¬native the means for calming the flow around the second outlet may be conical or hemispherical shaped. In any case the means can establish a calm flow around the outlet for water, and this improves the efficiency of the tank.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the well fluid separator tank com¬prises an elongate vortex breaker located in the lower part of the tank  and extending vertically at the centre of the tank. The vortex breaker serves to increase the capacity of the tank by acting on the vortex at the centre thereof in the lower part of the tank so that it has a reduced tendency to form a vortex eye. In an embodiment the vortex breaker is<br>
 <br>
a rod, which is co-axial with the tank and preferably the rod extends in the range from 1/2 to 5/6 of the height of the tank. The rod serves to prevent formation of a vortex eye, a zone free of water and oil, in the central part of the separator. Formation of such a zone will decrease the capacity of the separator.<br>
In a further embodiment the vortex breaker is combined with the means for calming the flow. The combination can e.g. be effected by fixing the rod to the disc that is placed in a horizontal position above the second outlet in the lower part of the tank, with the rod extending from the disc upwards into the tank.<br>
In an embodiment of the tank, the first opening at the upper end of the upward protruding conical frusta shaped wall has a diameter in the range of 15% to.40% of the internal diameter of the wall of the tank. Larger or smaller values are possible, but the range mentioned provides a suitable interaction between the vortex flow in the upper part of the tank and the vortex flow in the lower part of the tank. It is pre¬ferred that said diameter is in the range of 20% to 30% of the internal diameter of the wall of the tank, such as a diameter of about 25% of the internal diameter of the wall of the tank. With a diameter of said 25% the first opening has a larger diameter than the diameter of the outlet opening to the first outlet. This brings the advantage that variations in the liquid level in the area of the outlet opening to the first outlet do not suppress fluid flow up through the first opening.<br>
Preferably, the second outlet is located a larger distance from<br>
the upward protruding conical frusta shaped wall than the distance be¬<br>
tween the conical frusta shaped wall and the first outlet. The lower part<br>
of the tank consequently has a larger volume than the upper part of the<br>
tank. This embodiment is in particular suitable for processing a well fluid<br>
flow having a high content of water.<br>
	In order to improve the capacity the well fluid separator tank<br>
preferably has the first outlet coaxial with the first opening. The first outlet can be located to a side In the top of the tank, but the central lo¬cation and vertical extent obtained when the first outlet is coaxial with<br>
 <br>
the first opening result in a more regular vortex flow in the upper part of the tank, and to some degree also in the lower part, as the two vor¬tex flows influence one another.<br>
When the tank is embodied with a vortex breaker formed as a rod the regularity of the vortex flow can be increased primarily in the lower part of the tank, and to some degree also in the upper part of the tank, by locating the rod so that it is coaxial with the first opening.<br>
Preferably the first opening and the first outlet and the second outlet are coaxial. This coaxial location of both outlets and the first opening acts together with the circular cylindrical tank wall to produce very efficient vortex flows in the tank.<br>
In a further embodiment the well fluid separator tank further comprises means for gas injection provided at the tangentially arranged inlet, whereby the gas is injected into the incoming fluid in the. tank. Subsequently, the gas forms small bubbles in the fluid that promote separation. The gas used for gas injection may be any gas suitable for forming bubbles in the fluid, e.g. CO2, nitrogen or a gas based on hydro¬carbons, and preferably the gas is recycled gas from a water/oil/gas separation. The amount of gas added is typically in the range of 0.02 to 0.2 St.m3 per 1 m3 of fluid. Values in the range of 0.05 to 0.18 St.m3 per 1 m3 of fluid are preferred, but higher values for the amount of gas added can also be used, such as an amount of up to 0.3 St.m3 per 1 m3 of fluid. St.m3 is standard cubic meters of thegaseous medium. St.m3 is standardised within the offshore field (volume of dry gas at 15.6°C and a pressure of 101.325 kPa).<br>
Using gas from an external source has several disadvantages. The supply of gas has to be maintained, and the gas is to some extent consumed so that new gas supplies have to be obtained at intervals. And the systems on the downstream side of the well fluid separator tank have to handle the additional flow caused by added gas.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the gas source for the means for gas injection is a gas zone in the upper part of the well fluid separator tank. Gas separated out from the inlet fluid is consequently used as a<br>
 <br>
source for gas to be added to the inlet fluid, and in this nnanner savings in external gas supplies are obtained. In an even more preferred em¬bodiment the gas zone in the upper part of the well fluid separator tank is the sole gas source for the means for gas injection. This makes it possible to completely dispense with installing external supplies for gas, and the separator tank system thus has a more simple design.<br>
In a further embodiment a conduit from the gas zone in the up¬per part of the tank is connected to an eductor in the inlet to the same tank. The eductor has the advantage of no moving parts and thus high reliability. The reliability of the well fluid separator tank as such is con¬sequently improved in comparison to an embodiment using external supply of gas, also because the fluid, such as produced water, automati¬cally provides the supply of gas.<br>
In yet an embodiment the -conduit from the gas zone in the up¬per part of the tank is in open direct flow connection with the eductor in the inlet to the same tank, during operation of the tank. There is conse¬quently no pump in said conduit. A flow indicator can be provided in the conduit but that does not prevent the open direct flow connection. The means for gas injection embodied in this manner are completely self-sustained and automatically operating at very high reliability.<br>
In a further aspect the invention relates to a method for sepa¬rating a well fluid including water, oil and gas comprising at least the steps of:<br>
a)	feeding well fluid to be treated through a tangentially ar¬ranged inlet to an upper part of a first well fluid separator tank thereby causing a vortex flow of the fluid in said upper part above an upward protruding conical frusta shaped wall, a vortex flow in a lower part of the first tank below the upward protruding conical frusta shaped wall and an upward directed flow of oil and gas through a first opening cen¬trally at an upper end of the upward protruding conical frusta shaped wall;<br>
b)	taking a stream of oil and gas from at least one first outlet at the top of the first tank, and subjecting said stream of oil and gas to a<br>
 <br>
further separation in a second well fluid separation tank to obtain an oil stream through at least one second outlet in the lower part of the sec¬ond tank and a first gas streann through at least one first outlet in the upper part of the second tank;<br>
c) taking out a first stream of water through at least one sec¬ond outlet at the bottom of the first tank, and feeding said stream of water through a tangentially arranged inlet to an upper part of a third well fluid separator tank thereby causing a vortex flow in said upper part of the third tank above an upward protruding conical frusta shaped wall, a vortex flow in a lower part of the third tank below the upward protruding conical frusta shaped wall, and an upward directed flow of gas through a first opening centrally at an upper end of the upward pro¬truding conical frusta shaped wall, and<br>
d&gt; taking out a stream of cleaned water through at least one    second outlet in the lower part of the third tank.<br>
The method makes is possible to separate the stream of cleaned water from the other constituents of the well fluid comprising water, oil and gas, and the stream of cleaned water has a high degree of purity. The oil phase and the gas phase can be discharged for use or further treatment, and the stream of cleaned water can be returned to the environment, e.g. the sea or the reservoir. The method according to the present invention is advantageous in several aspects. The well fluid separator tanks utilized in the method have no moving parts, and they are highly robust to processing well fluid of varying compositions. And the method is efficient in cleaning the water also when the well fluid contains a large proportion of water. The method is consequently well suited to prolong the productive life of matured oil and gas fields where the water content is high in the fluid stream from the well head, typi¬cally because water has been injected into the reservoir for years while oil has been produced.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the method, the fluid or liquid in the first tank and/or second tank and/or third tank has been sub¬jected to gas injection upstream of the inlet opening to the tank. Thus,<br>
 <br>
gas injection may be applied in one of the separation tanks only, in two of the separation tanl<s or in all of the separation tanks. injected gas facilitates flotation process separating water from gas. as best results are achieved when is dispersed fluid tiny bubbles it preferred that into inlet duct via a nozzle device located only short distance opening to avoid merging form bigger which do not have same efficiency .the injection pref performed tank and more preferably means for pipe close vicinity e.g. cm opening. nozzles may this case be ring shaped type. optionally recycled natural however also nitrogen carbon dioxide mixtures gasses.></s>
In a further aspect, the invention also relates to the use of well fluid separator tanks of the above-mentioned type, where two or more separator tanks are used in series or in parallel in order to obtain a bet¬ter phase separation. A further possibility is to use separator tanks both in series and in parallel. How the separator tanks should be connected depends on the specific situation. In any case, this will be a matter for a skilled person to deal with as a matter of routine. The well fluid separa¬tor tanks according to the invention are used for separating fluid from a well head in oil and gas production, and typically the well fluid fed to the well fluid separator tanks is a water-rich waste stream separated off from the well stream delivered by the well head. Such an initial separa¬tion into an oil/gas phase and a water phase can occur in one or more separation steps. The well fluid separator tank or tanks may e.g. be used in an intermediate cleaning step of a water stream containing small amounts of oil and gas, or e.g. be used in a final cleaning step of such a water stream, or the well fluid separator tank can be used on the main stream from the well head, preferably when a significant part of this stream is water, or on a partial stream thereof, and possibly on a<br>
 <br>
partial stream from another separator. In any case the water, oil and gas may originate from a well head and are as such in the present con¬text considered well fluids irrespective of where in the production facility the separator is actually used to separate a stream of fluid.<br>
The use further includes an embodiment wherein the oil/gas phase is separated into an oil phase and a gas phase in an additional separation step.<br>
In the following, illustrative, non-limiting examples of embodi¬ments ofthe invention will be described in further detail with reference to the highly schematic drawings in which<br>
Figure 1 depicts schematically an embodiment of a well fluid separator tank according to the present invention,'<br>
Figure 2 depicts the separator tank in Figure 1 viewed from above at the cross sectional broken line II-II,<br>
Figure 3 depicts a further embodiment according to the pre¬sent invention,<br>
Figure 4 depicts an arrangement where three separator tanks according to the invention are used for sepa¬rating a fluid comprising oil, gas and water.<br>
Figure 5 depicts an arrangement where separator tanks ac¬cording to the invention are used in series, and<br>
Figure 6 depicts an arrangement where separator tanks ac¬cording to the invention are used in parallel.<br>
The embodiment illustrated in Fig. 1 of a well fluid separator tank 1 according to the invention is a substantial cylindrical tank with a tangentially arranged inlet 2 for fluid, such as a mixture comprising wa-' ter, oil and gas. Inlet 2 extends to an inlet opening in the wall of the tank. The tank 1 further comprises a first outlet 4 at the top of the tank and a second outlet 3 at the bottom of the tank. The first outlet is typi¬cally for fluid having less density than the fluid taken out through the second outlet. The second outlet 3 can e.g. be for water, and the first<br>
 <br>
outlet 4 can e.g. be for oil/gas. The well fluid mixture of water, oil and gas may originate from a fluid stream of the well head or it may origi¬nate from a branch stream of a fluid stream, or from a stream sepa¬rated of from any such streams.<br>
Just below the level of the inlet 2 is attached a conical frusta shaped wall 5 which protrudes upwards and divides the tank into an up¬per part 6 and a lower part 7. The upward protruding conical frusta shaped wall 5 has a first opening 8 at the upper end to allow communi¬cation between the upper 6 and lower part 7 of the tank 1. The angle indicated with curved arrow 9, between the vertical sidewall of the tank<br>
1	and the upper side of conical frusta shaped wall 5 is in the range be¬<br>
tween 15° and 70°, preferably between 20 and 50°. This express the in¬<br>
clination of the conical frusta shaped wail 5.<br>
The conical frusta shaped wall 5 is besides the first opening 8 equipped with a second opening 10 at the level of the inlet 2. As shown the second opening 10 is located in the conical frusta shaped wall 5 in such a way that a liquid coming into the separator tank 1 from the inlet<br>
2	will rotate about 300° around the upper part of the conical frusta<br>
shaped wall 5 in the upper part 6 of the tank before passing through the<br>
  second opening 10 into the lower part of the tank 7.<br>
The tangential inlet 2 in combination with the cylindrical wall of the tank 1 provides for a formation of a vortex flow in the upper part of the tank and of a vortex flow in the lower part of the tank. However, the vortex flow may form a vortex eye in the centre of the tank which eye is<br>
 free of liquid mixture. The formation of a vortex eye is undesired due decreased capacity. It has appeared than the formation of a vortex eye can be avoided by placing an elongated member, such as a vertically extending rod 11 in the centre of the tank 1. The rod 11 extends ap¬proximately 2/3 of the tank height into the tank from the bottom area of<br>
 the tank where the rod is attached to a conical member 12 that covers the second outlet 3, when viewed from above, and thus is a means for calming a stream around the second outlet. The conical member 12 may e.g. be attached to the wall of the tank 1 by use of two or more flat<br>
 <br>
bars. Also rod 11 can be attached to the wall of the tank or to the coni¬cal frusta shaped wall 5 by several flat bars or other supporting or brac¬ing members, such as round metal.<br>
As indicated on Figure 1 the second outlet 3 is equipped with a valve 13. By adjusting this valve 13 the pressure build-up by gas re¬leased from the mixture in the tank can be adjusted. The gas released from the mixture is collected in the upper part of the tank 6. The more gas that is collected the higher the pressure becomes. As the pressure of the gas increases the gas displaces the liquid mixture in the tank 1. When the collected gas has displaced the liquid mixture to a level below an outlet opening 14 to the first outlet 4, gas and oil are ejected out of the tank via the outlet 4 due to gas pressure. As illustrated in Figure 1 the first outlet 4 Is a pipe extending down into the upper part of the<br>
tank to the outlet opening 14 which is located at a distance A below the	<br>
top of the tank.<br>
The first opening 8 in the conical frusta shaped wall 5 is up¬wards open into the upper part of the tank, which upper part of the tank is downwards delimited by the upper side of the conical frusta shaped wall 5. The first opening 8 is located at centre line C of tank 1 and is preferably coaxial therewith. The cylindrical wall of tank 1 extends in parallel with centre line C between the curved end bottoms of the tank. Rod 11 is also coaxial with centre line C and the first outlet extends co-axially with centre line C. The first opening 8 is consequently located opposite outlet opening 14 and has a larger diameter than outlet open¬ing 14.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates a cross section of the tank 1 taken along line II-II in Figure 1, The incoming well fluid feed enters tank 1 via the tangentially arranged inlet 2 and substantially all of the feed circles around the conical frusta shaped wall 5 with the first opening 8 at the ) top of the wall 5 before it may enter through opening 10. The angle 15 is preferably in the range 20-30°, more preferably 25°. The angle 16 de¬fining the horizontal extension of the opening 10 is preferably in the range 30-40°, more preferably in the range 35°. Gas can be injected<br>
 <br>
into the fluid flowing through inlet 2. In one embodiment (not illus¬trated) gas, such as nitrogen or fuel gas, is supplied to inlet 2 from an external source. In a preferred embodiment illustrated in Fig. 3 gas is taken out from a gas zone 101 in the upper part 6 of the separator tank. The gas flows from gas zone 101 through conduit 102 and into an eductor 103 mounted in inlet 2 to tank 1. The eductor is embodied as a conduit part having a short length and having a smaller cross-sectional area than the adjacent conduit parts forming inlet 2. Due to the reduced area the velocity is higher in the fluid flow through the eductor than in  the adjacent parts of the inlet, and as a result the fluid pressure in the eductor is relatively low so that gas is sucked from conduit 102 into the fluid flowing through the eductor.<br>
Conduit 102 is provided with a flow indicator 104 or flow sen¬sor, which does not prevent the eductor from being in open direct flow connection with gas zone 101 when the separator tank is operating. Gas zone 101 also communicates with an gas outlet line 105 provided with a compressor 106 to increase the pressure in the outlet gas. In the em¬bodiment illustrated in Fig. 3 the means for gas injection to the inlet of the separator tank are completely self-sustained and automatically op¬erating.<br>
The embodiment of Fig. 3 has an additional advantage in that the gas system is in flow balance in the sense that the surplus gas taken out through gas outlet line 105 corresponds to the difference be¬tween the gas supplied with the fluid inflow through inlet 2 and the gas leaving through first outlet 4. The flow of gas into the tank is larger, and preferably much larger, such as at least 50% larger or 100% larger, than the aggregate gas flow out of first outlet 4 and gas outlet line 105.<br>
In another embodiment the gas injection is performed in the inlet to the tank, and the means for gas injection are located in the inlet  pipe in close vicinity to the inlet. The nozzle for injection may in this case be of a ring shaped type.<br>
The separator tank according to the invention is usually oper¬ated at a pressure determined mainly by the pressure with which the<br>
 <br>
fluid leaves the well head, however the pressure may also be increased or reduced before entering the separator tank using known procedures. The separator tank may be operated at a pressure corresponding to at¬mospheric pressure and upwards.<br>
The dimensions of the separator may be selected depending on<br>
the amounts of fluid intended to be treated. In operation is has been<br>
found that the residence time in the tank for a fluid to be treated should<br>
be from about 20 seconds and upwards, preferably the residence time is<br>
in the range of 20 to 300 seconds, more preferably 25 to 240 seconds.<br>
	For the separation tank according to the invention, an effi-<br>
cient separation volume may be calculated as the volume of the space Dounded by the tank and the height of the liquid in the tank. Based on the residence time the capacity of the tank may be calculated, e.g. a tank with an efficient separation volume of 1 m3 and a residence time, for the liquid of about 30 seconds has a capacity for treating about 100 m3 fluid per hour.<br>
The ratio of height to diameter of the tank can be selected within wide limits preferably in the range of 1:1 to 4:1 more preferably from 1:1 to 2:1, but the tank can also have a height larger than four times the diameter.<br>
It is within the abilities of a person skilled in the art to select materials used for the construction of the tank based on the actual con¬ditions for the intended use, such as the amounts of liquid to be treated, the composition of said liquid, the selected pressure, the temperature of the liquid and the presence of possibly corrosive chemicals in any of the phases of the mixture.<br>
During operation the rate with which the separated phases are withdrawn (rejected) via the respective outlets determines where the inter-phases between gas and oil, or gas and water, oil and water, and water and possible solids are located in the tank. The skilled person will appreciate how to adjust the rate of withdrawal via the respective outlets so that the optimal separation will be achieved.<br>
Because of the way the separator tank according to the in-<br>
 <br>
vention is constructed with all surfaces vertical or having a steep incli¬nation except for guide vane and vortex breaker and no narrow pas¬sages in the tank, there Is no place in the separator, which is suscepti¬ble to clogging or deposition of solid materials. Therefore the separation of the well fluid at the production facility at the well head may be per¬formed essentially continuously without or only with a minimal need for maintenance of the separator tank.<br>
Further maintenance, when it is necessary even though it is in¬frequent, can easily be performed due to the well-thought-out design of the separator tank.<br>
Thus the separation of the fluid at the well head or in the well stream according to the invention has a remarkable robustness i.e. it can be run for long periods without interruptions, and the few stops that may be required for maintenance can be made short.<br>
The high capacity combined with the minimum space re¬quirements and the robustness of the separation tank according to the invention makes it particularly suited for use at off-shore installations such as oil and gas production platforms. Furthermore, it is also well suited for use in oil and gas production located on the sea bed, because at such a location the constraints on space may be even stricter than on traditional oil and gas production platforms and the capacity for mainte¬nance may be lower. The separator tank is highly useful in oil and gas production both on-shore and off-shore.<br>
Now the  invention will  be further illustrated  by examples,   which should not be regarded as limiting the invention. The same refer¬ence numerals as in the above is used for indicating the same details, however the numerals may be provided with apostrophe(s) in order to discern the one tank form the other.<br>
   EXAMPLES<br>
1. Use of three separation tanks according to the inven¬tion as separators for three phase separation.<br>
 <br>
With reference to Figure 4 use of separation tanks for separat¬ing a well streann comprising oil, gas and water is schematically de¬picted.<br>
The use includes three well fluid separator tanks 1, 1' and 1" according to the invention. The first outlet 4 of tank 1 is for oil and gas and is connected to the inlet 2' on tank 1'. Likewise, the second outlet 3 of tank 1 is for water (with minor amounts of oil and gas) and is con¬nected to the inlet 2" on tank 1".<br>
The well fluid separated from the well head is lead to tank 1 via inlet 2. In tank 1 the fluid is separated into a gas and oil phase and a water phase. The gas and oil phase is taken out from tank 1 via first outlet 4 and lead to tank 1' via inlet 2'. The water phase (with minor amounts of oil and gas) is taken out from tank 1 via second outlet 3 and         lead to tank 1" via inlet 2".<br>
In tank 1' the gas and oil phase is separated into gas, which leaves tank 1' via first outlet 4', and oil, which leaves tank 1' via second outlet 3'.<br>
In tank 1" the water phase is separated into water and oil/gas. The oil/gas leaves tank 1" via first outlet 4" and a stream of cleaned water leaves tank 1" via second outlet 3".<br>
In order to improve the separation in the tank 1" further gas may be injected at inlet 2" into the incoming well fluid stream from the second outlet 3, The gas for injection may be a part of the recovered gas from first outlet 4', as indicated by the broken line 114.<br>
The two tanks 1 and 1" are provided with a conduit 102 con¬necting the gas zone in the tank with an eductor in the inlet 2 and inlet 2", respectively. Optionally tank 1' may also be provided with such a conduit 102.<br>
By the described arrangement a fluid from a well head compris- ing oil, gas and water is very effectively separated into an oil phase, a gas phase and a water phase, where the stream of cleaned water leav¬ing tank 1" via the second outlet 3" contains less than 10 ppm impuri¬ties.<br>
 <br>
2.	Use of three separator tanks according to the inven¬<br>
tion as separators in series.<br>
Figure 5 schematically depicts three tanks 1, 1', and 1" con¬nected in series for separating a well stream 204 from a well head into an oil/gas phase 205 and a water phase 206. The well stream 204 may e.g. be water comprising 1000 ppm of impurities (gas/oil). Subsequent to treatment in tank 1 the water stream in line 207 from the second outlet 3 comprises 100 ppm impurities. The stream 207 is fed to inlet 2' for treatment in tank 1', and the water stream in line 208 from the sec¬ond outlet 3' from tank 1' comprises 10 ppm impurities. The stream 208 is finally fed to inlet 2" for treatment in tank 1", thus providing a water stream 206 from outlet 3" with less than 5 ppm impurities.<br>
The tanks 1, 1' and 1" are provided with a conduit 102 connect¬ing the gas zone in the tank with an eductor in the inlet 2, inlet 2', and inlet 2", respectively.<br>
This arrangement may optionally be used for further treatment of the water stream from the second outlet 3" from tank 1" in the tank arrangement illustrated in Fig. 4 (Example 1). The oil/gas phase may be separated into oil and gas by treatment in a further tank as described in Example 1. Optionally the oil/gas phase may be separated in two or more tanks in series.<br>
3.	Use of separator tanlts according to the invention as<br>
i  separators in parallel.<br>
Figure 6 schematically depicts an arrangement where two tanks 1 and 1' are used in parallel. Well fluid from a well head part streams 303 and 304 enters tanks 1 and 1' at inlets 2 and 2'. An oil/gas phase is taken out at 305 and a water phase is taken out at 306. The oil/gas  phase and the water phase may be further treated as described in Ex¬amples 1 and 2.<br>
The tanks 1 and 1' are provided with a conduit 102 connecting the gas zone in the tank with an eductor in the inlet 2 and inlet 2', re-<br>
 <br>
spectively.<br>
Figures 1 to 6 are only schematical and the arrangements may comprise further equipment normally used in oil and gas production lil<e e.g. valves pumps compressors further pipelines which are excluded for simplicity. however the arrangement described above can easily be adapted specific use by a skilled person.></e>
Moreover, it is evident that the well fluid separator tanks ac¬cording to the invention can be used in combination in any desired ar¬rangement, e.g. in series and/or in parallel. The well fluid separator tanks and the method and the use according to the present invention can be modified within the scope of the appended patent claims. Details of the various embodiments can be combined into new embodiments within the scope of the patent claims. It is e.g. possible to provide an individual tank with two or more first outlets and/or with two or more second outlets and/or with two or more inlets. The first outlet can be provided with a valve, and both the first outlet and the second outlet can be provided with a valve. The first outlet and/or the second outlet can be mounted at other locations than coaxial with centre line C, such as parallel with the centre line C, but at a distance from the centre line. The eductor used in the inlet can be replaced with another mixing de¬vice for mixing gas and fluid, or with a mixing device in the inlet in combination with a pump in conduit 102 for withdrawing the gas from the gas zone. Such an embodiments is however less favourable because it is more complicated and not like the embodiment of Fig. 3 an auto¬matic, self-regulating system which is independent from outside sup¬plies and has no moving parts. The system illustrated in Fig. 3 for taking out gas from a gas zone 101 in the upper part 9 of the separator tank and feeding the gas to the inlet of the same tank may be used also in  connection with separator tanks of other designs that the design illus¬trated on Figs. 1 and 2 and claimed in claim 1.<br>
