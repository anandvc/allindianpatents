BACKGROUND ART<br>
Arsenic contamination (above 10 ppb) in ground water is a serious global problem to the public health. The contamination is highest in Bengal basin of the river Ganga. The worst suffered countries with the problem are specifically India especially West Bengal and Bangladesh, improper disposal of arsenic-rich waste will increase soil arsenic level above the maximum allowed levels.<br>
Due to environmental and health problems associated with arsenic contamination various methods for removal of arsenic from waste has been developed to favour reducing arsenic from the contaminated ground water below permissible level. The method usually used include coagulation-filtration using alum and ferric salts, adsorption using activated alumina and granular ferric oxide, nano-filtration, reverse osmosis and ion exchange. Most widely accepted industrial methods include coagulation -filtration and surface adsorption. Attempts have also been made to manage waste by stabilization through cementation and leaching techniques.<br>

In accordance with yet further aspect of the present invention it is possible to convert the acidic ferric solution of step (v) above to solid crystalline hydrous ferric oxide suitable as arsenic adsorbent.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The above process of the invention therefore provides for a simple, eco-friendly process for the treatment of waste to substantially free the same of arsenic. Importantly, in the above process the acid concentration 8.0 to 9.0 (M) with respect to HCI is required for selective and quantitative separation of arsenic sulphide from the solution. This would be clearly apparent from the variation in the percentage purity of the arsenic (III) sulphide based on the variation in the acid conc, as identified by way of the invention and noted hereunder in Table I.<br><br>
Below the acid concentration of 8-9 (M), antimony with some other metal sulphide is found to be precipitated with arsenic sulphide. Also by increasing the acid cone. Beyond 9(M) ,it is found not possible to improve further the purity of the product. The above clearly and sufficiently bring out the preferred selective range of 8 to 9.0(M) of the acid cone, desired in the above process of the invention. Moreover, the solution left after recovery of the arsenic as arsenic sulphide in the above process can be reused for water treatment after treatment of the same with sodium hypochloride solution in weakly basic medium.<br><br>
5<br>
The basic materials required for the above treatment thus include cone. HCI, NaHSO3, H2S (g), NaOCI, NaOH and carbon disulphide.<br>
The waste solution preferably acidified is boiled with 20ml of 5% NaHSC&gt;3 solution and then treated with H2S (g).<br>
The precipitate formed was separated from the liquid by simple filtering followed by washing with H2S-saturated water. The filtrate with washing was made weakly basic and treated with NaOCI solution. Here, sulphide becomes sulfate on boiling and metal hydroxide precipitate appears. The precipitate was next dissolved in HCL while the solution Was reused for water treatment to reduce the arsenic content below toxic level. The volume of solution to be added 10-15 ml per litre of water to reduce arsenic 
Arsenic sulphide precipitate was next dissolved in hot NaOH, solution, made acidic again to 8.0-9.0 M with respect to HCI and reprecipitated by H2S(g) as mentioned earlier followed by filtration through a known weight sintered glass crucible and washing with carbon disulphide, drying in an air oven at 120Â°C for 3 hours. Importantly, in the above process the step of treatment with NaOCI in weakly alkaline medium avoids environmental hazards converting sulphide to sulfate and hence, the process is eco-friendly. Also, the step of the process involving the reduction of arsenic(V) or arsenic(lll) by boiling with sodium bisulfite solution(10%) and then, the acid concentration 8.0 to 9.0 M with respect to HCI before adding H2S(g) are found to be critical for effective removal of arsenic as arsenic sulphide.<br>
The crystalline hydrous ferric oxide can also be prepared from the acidic ferric solution. This solid crystalline hydrous ferric oxide was found to be useful for arsenic (III) adsorption. Adsorption capacity was found to be 60-65mg/g at pH 6.0 to 7.0. Thus, synthetic crystalline hydrous ferric oxide could be used as an adsorbent for arsenic removal filters. <br><br>
6<br>
The details of the invention, its objects and advantages are explained hereunder in greater detail in relation to non-limiting exemplary illustrations as hereunder:<br>
Examples<br>
Material:<br>
Hazardous arsenic-rich waste collected for the study were of five types   as detailed hereunder in TABLE II<br><br>
Method for Recovery of Arsenic involving.the process of the invention from the above varieties of wastes was carried out as detailed hereunder:<br>
20.0 gm of each dried waste was dissolved in 50ml of 6(M) HCL, evaporated nearly to pasty mass, then extracted with water and filtered. The filtrate was acidified with HCl and boiled with 1.0g NaHSO3 till SO2 evolution ceased. It was made 8.0 to 9.0 (M) with respect to HCI, which was then saturated with H2S(g) at hot condition into a closed vessel, fitted with an outlet. The open   end of the outlet was kept into a 0.1   (M) NaOH  solution to adsorbed<br><br>
7<br>
unreacted H2S (g). Then, the crude, As2S3 was dissolved in 25ml of 1 (M) NaOH solution. After that this solution was acidified with 9(M) HCI solution. Now H2S gas passed through the solution in hot condition and the yellow AS2S3 is reprecipitated. The yellow precipitate of As2S3 was filtered through a known weighed sintered glass crucible; washed with carbon disulphide to make free from sulfur and finally dried at 120-130Â°C. The dried product was reweigh to have the amount of As2S3. The filtrate and H2S adsorber were boiled separately with NaOCI solution to convert unreacted H2S to sulfate in alkaline medium.<br>
The recovery of arsenic as arsenic (III) sulphide from the above waste varieties are represented in Table III hereunder:<br><br>
Finally, arsenic in the filtrate was analyzed. Crystalline hydrous ferric oxide (CHFO) was prepared from the iron-rich filtrate solution. It was found that arsenic adsorption capacity of this CHFO is comparable to the product obtained from a fresh ferric chloride solution.<br>
After recovery of As2S3 precipitate, the filtrate of volume 500 ml was analyzed for arsenic and found arsenic content was always less than 0.05mg/l. Thus the solution can be disposed off on surface soil safely, since the average arsenic   content   in   surface   soil   is   in   the   range   of  5.5   to   13   mg/Kg.<br><br>
8<br>
Furthermore, as disclosed above the waste variants such as FASW, FCSW and GFOW contain high amount of iron in'the filtrate. The filtrate, after converting dissolved sulphide into sulfate by boiling with NaOCI in alkaline medium, gives precipitate of Fe(OH)3. After drying of the precipitate, it was used systematically in removing arsenic from contaminated water. It was to be found that this Fe(OH)3 has good arsenic sorption capacity, which is comparable to the Fe(OH)3 prepared from pure ferric Chloride solution at pH of 6.0 to 7.0.<br><br>
