BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Adenosine acts extracellularly via activation of specific membrane-bound receptors called Pi-purinoceptors. These adenosine receptors can be divided into four subclasses, Ai, A2A, A2b and A3 receptors. All four classes are coupled to the<br>
enzyme adenylate cyclase. Activation of the adenosine A1 and A3 receptors leads to an inhibition of adenylate cyclase, while activated A2A and A2B receptors stimulate adenylate cyclase. The adenosine receptors are ubiquitously distributed throughout the body. As a consequence, ligands need to be highly selective in their action with respect to receptor subtype and tissue to be of therapeutic value.<br>
Receptor subtype selectivity can be achieved by substituting the adenosine molecule. For example modification at the N6 position of adenosine is well tolerated. N6-substituents such as cyclopentyl enhance adenosine A1 receptor selectivity relative to the other subtypes,1,2 while a 3-iodobenzyl group induces adenosine-A3 receptor selectivity.3-5 Bulky substituents such as (ar)alkylamino,6 allylidenehydrazino7 and alkynyl,8 at the 2-position of the adenine moiety yield selectivity for the adenosine A2A receptor compared to A1. Only more recently, the 2-(ar)alkynyl adenosine derivatives have been evaluated at the adenosine A3 receptor. Quite surprisingly, some of these compounds appeared to be selective for the adenosine A3 receptor rather than for A2A-9.10<br>
Tissue selectivity is often the result of partial agonism, which may reduce the extent of side effects.11-12 Due to differences in receptor-effector coupling in various tissues selectivity of action in vivo may be achieved. Partial agonists for the adenosine receptors may be of use as antipsychotic drugs, e.g., via stimulation of the adenosine A2A receptor that leads to inhibition of dopamine D2 receptors in the basal ganglia,13-14 and as cardio- and cerebroprotective agents via the adenosine A3 receptor when chronically administered.15'16.<br>

The compounds of the present invention may be prepared by several synthesis procedures. For example, the synthesis route to obtain the C2,5'-disubstituted derivatives 33-40 and 45-48 are depicted in scheme 1 hereinbelow:<br>
R'= SCH3, SC2H5, S-n-C3H7 or S-i-C3H7; 37-40 R= OtyCBzhCHy, 45-48 R= NHN=CHCH2CH(CH3)2; (a) HMPA, SOCI2, Dowex 50 W (it); (b) i) RSH, 2M NaOH, reflux it) acetic acid; (c) i) DMAP, CH3CN, Et3N, acetic anhydride ii) MeOH; (d) CH3CN, Et4NCl, HN-dimethylaniline, POCl3, reflux; (e) 5 I2, CH2l2, Cul, isopentylnitrite, THF; (f) EtOH/NH3; (g) CH3CN, Et3N, Cul, PdCI2, Ph3P, 1-hexyn; (h) i) isopropanol, hydrazine moaohydrate, reflux ii) MeOH, isovalderaldehyde, reflux<br>
According to this scheme, the synthesis of the compounds of the invention started with 2-iodoadenosine (1), which is an important intermediate for the<br>
18<br>
10 synthesis of several adenosine derivatives, described in literature. 2-Hydrazinoadenosine (2) was synthesized starting from 1 by stirring it with hydrazine monohydrate at 80°C. 2-(N'-3-MetHyl-l-butylidenehydrazino)-adenosine (3) was generated by the condensation of 2 with isovaleraldehyde according to the method of Niiya et al? 2-(l-Hexynyl)adenosine (4) was prepared in good yield<br>
15 (88%) by reacting 1 with 1-hexyn. 8,19 Part of the synthesis route for compounds 33-40 and 45-48 was similar to that of compounds 2-4, except for the fact that prior to<br>
-11-<br>
C-2 substitution, the 5'-alkylthio substituents were introduced. In fact, this was performed in an early stage of the route, i.e. at commercially available guanosine, which was also used as the starting material for 2-iodoadenosine (1) itself. The 5'-(alkylthio)-substituted derivatives 17-20 were obtained by reacting 5'-chIoro-5'-deoxy-guanosine (16) with the appropriate thiol in 2 M NaOH.1,5,20 Subsequently, the 2',3'-hydroxyl groups were acetyl protected to avoid complications during further synthesis, and compounds 21-24 were obtained in quantitative yields.<br>
Chlorination. on the 6-position of compounds 21-24 was performed with phosphoryl chloride (POCl3),18,21 yielding 2-amino-6-chloro-9-(2,3-di-0-acetyl-5-alkylthio-5-deo^-a-D-ribo-furanosyl)-purine derivatives 25-28 in reasonable to good yields (40-74%). Subsequently, the 2-amino group of compounds 25-28 was replaced by iodine via a diazotization-iodine substitution reaction. This method appeared to be an efficient way to prepare 29-32. The 5'-alkylthio-2-iodoadenosine intermediates, 33-36, were obtained by stirring 29-32 with ethanol saturated with ammonia. The acetyl protecting groups were readily removed under these conditions. The 6-position, however, was aminated only after a few days. Finally, as for compound 3,8 the 2-(l-hexynyl) group could be easily introduced in 33-36, and the 5'-alkylthio-5'-deoxy-2-(l-hexYnyl)adenosine derivatives 37-40 were obtained in good yields. The 5'-alkylthio-5'-deoxy 2-(N'-3-methyl-l-butylidenehydrazino)adenosine derivatives (45-48) were synthesized by the condensation of the 5'-deoxy-2-hydrazino-5'-alkylthioadenosine derivatives (41-44) with isovaleraldehyde as described above.<br>
Alternatively, the N6,C2,5'tri-substituted adenosine derivatives 66-83 of the invention may be prepared by the following scheme 2:<br>
12<br>
Reaction conditions: a: acetone; MeOH, 2,2-dimethoxypropane, HC1 gas, b: NaH, DMF, alkylhalide, c: i) 0.04 MNaOH ii) BaC03, d) pyridine, DMAP, acetic anhydride, e: 1,2-dichloroethane, silylated base, TMSOTf, f. i) EtOH/NH3 or ii) abs. EtOH, appropriate amine<br>
According to this scheme, the protected ribose (50) was obtained by leading HC1 gas through a solution of the starting material D-ribose (49) in a mixture of acetone, MeOH and 2,2-dimethoxypropane.48 Alkylation of the free hydroxyl group of 50 was performed under standard conditions, i.e. treatment with NaH in DMF under cooling, followed by the addition of the alkylhalide iodomethane, iodoethane or cyclopropylbromide, respectively. Subsequently, the protecting groups of the alkylated compounds 51-53 were removed by refluxing the material in aqueous HC1 (0.04 M) for 2 hours, and compounds 54-56 were obtained.49 The hydroxyl groups of 54-56 were men protected with acetyl groups. The fully protected compounds 57-59 were then coupled to the appropriate heterocyclic base, e.g. 6-chloropurine or 2,6-dichloropurine, according to the Vorbroggen method to give compounds 60-65 in good yields (48-84%). Amination with EtOH/NH3,<br>
-13-<br>
cyclopentylamine or 3-iodobenzylamine gave the unprotected substituted adenosine derivatives 68-83.1,5<br>
As will be detailed in the following specific examples, the compounds of the present invention are biologically active.<br>
The term "biologically active" indicates that the compound of the present invention has a biological activity, for example, a measurable effect on a target receptor. As will be detailed hereinafter, the compound of the present invention may induce the biological action of adenosine receptors, thus acting as adenosine receptor agonists.<br>
The term "agonist" used herein refers to a biologically active ligand, which binds to its complementary biologically active receptor and activates the latter either to cause a biological response in the receptor or to enhance preexisting biological activity of the receptor. The agonist in fact mimics the effect of the natural ligand, in the present case, the adenosine, or at times, even increases or prolongs the duration of the biological effect obtained as compared to the effect induced by the natural ligand.<br>
More preferably and as will be shown in the following Specific Examples, the compounds of the present invention are partial agonists of adenosine receptors.<br>
A compound according to the invention is considered a "partial agonist' if it is unable to produce maximal activation of the receptor to which it binds no matter how high is its concentration.<br>
The present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising as active ingredient an effective amount of one or more of a compound of the general formula (I):<br>
in which<br>
W represents an oxygen, or sulfur atom;<br>

treated and the treatment regime. The effective amount is typically determined in appropriately designed clinical trials (dose range studies) and the person versed in the art will know how to properly conduct such trials in order to determine the effective amount As generally known, an effective amount depends on a variety of factors including the affinity of the ligand to the receptor, its distribution profile within the body, a variety of pharmacological parameters such as half life in the body, on undesired side effects, if any, on factors such as age and gender, etc.<br>
The terms "treat, "treating" and "treatment1 refer to the administering of a therapeutic amount of the compound or composition of the present invention which is effective to ameliorate undesired symptoms associated with a disease, to prevent the manifestation of such symptoms before they occur, to slow down the progression of a disease, to slow down the deterioration of symptoms, to slow down the irreversible damage caused by the chronic stage of a disease, to lessen the severity or cure a disease, to improve survival rate or more rapid recovery, to prevent the disease from occurring, or a combination of two or more of the above.<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention, the disease is preferably such, which requires for its treatment the activation or inhibition of cAMP via the binding of a compound of the invention to an adenosine receptor. For example, compounds of the invention which in preference, bind and activate the A1 receptors may be implicated as e.g., sleep modulator, antihypertensives, analgesics, antidiabetic compounds, tissue-protective agents, compounds which bind and activate the A2A receptors may be implicated as e.g. antihypertensives and neuroleptics while compounds which bind and activate the A3 receptors may be implicated as e.g. tissue-protective agents and anti-tumor agents.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition of the present invention may further comprisepharmaceutically acceptable additives.<br>
Further, the term pharmaceutically acceptable additives" used herein refers to any substance combined with said compound and include, without being limited thereto, diluents, excipients, carriers, solid or liquid fillers or encapsulating<br>
materials which are typically added to formulations to give them a form or consistency when it is given in a specific form, e.g. in pill form, as a simple syrup, aromatic powder, and other various elixirs. The additives may also be substances for providing the formulation with stability, sterility and isotonicity (e.g. antimicrobial preservatives, antioxidants, chelating agents and buffers), for preventing the action of microorganisms (e.g. antimicrobial and antifungal agents, such as parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid and the like) or for providing the formulation with an edible flavor etc.<br>
Preferably, the additives are inert, non-toxic materials, which do not react<br>
with the active ingredient of the invention. Yet, the additives may be designed to<br>
enhance the binding of the active agent to its receptor. Further, the term additive<br>
may also include adjuvants, being substances affecting the action of the active<br>
ingredient in a predictable way.<br>
The additives can be any of those conventionally used and are limited only by chemico-physical considerations, such as solubility and lack of reactivity with the compound of the invention, and by the route of administration.<br>
The active agent of the invention may be administered orally to the patient. Conventional methods such as administering the compound/s in tablets, suspensions, solutions, emulsions, capsules, powder syrups and the like are usable.<br>
For oral administration, the composition of the invention may contain additives for facilitating oral delivery of the compound/s of the invention. Formulations suitable for oral administration can consist of (a) liquid solutions, such as an effective amount of the compound dissolved in diluents, such as water, saline, or orange juice; (b) capsules, sachets, tablets, lozenges, and troches, each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient, as solids or granules; (c) powders; (d) suspensions in an appropriate liquid; and (e) suitable emulsions. Liquid formulations may include diluents, such as water and alcohols, for example, ethanol, benzyl alcohol, and the polyethylene alcohols, either with or without the<br>
addition of a pharmaceutically acceptable surfactant, suspending agent, or emulsifying agent Capsule forms can be of the ordinary hard- or soft-shelled gelatin type containing, for example, surfactants, lubricants, and inert fillers, such as lactose, sucrose, calcium phosphate, and corn starch. Tablet forms can include one or more of lactose, sucrose, mannitol, corn starch, potato starch, alginic acid, microcrystalline cellulose, acacia, gelatin, guar gum, colloidal silicon dioxide, croscannellose sodiumk talc, magnesium stearate, calcium stearate, zinc stearate, stearic acid, and other excipients, colorants, diluents, buffering agents, dismtegrating agents, moistening agents, preservatives, flavoring agents, and pharmacologically compatible carriers. Lozenge forms can comprise the active agent in a flavor, usually sucrose and. acacia or tragacanth, as well as pastilles comprising the active ingredient in an inert base, such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acacia, emulsions, gels, and the like. Such additives are known in the art<br>
Alternatively, the compound/s may be administered to the patient parenteralry. In this case, the composition will generally be formulated in a unit dosage injectable form (solution, suspension, emulsion). Pharmaceutical formulation suitable for injection may include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for reconstitution into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersing medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, lipid polyethylene glycol and the like), suitable mixtures thereof; a vegetable oil such as cottonseed oil, sesame oil, olive oil, soybean oil, corn oil, sunflower oil, or peanut oil; a fatty acid esters such as ethyl oleate and isopropyl myristate and variety of other solvent systems as known per se. The carrier may be chosen based on the physical and chemical properties of the active agent<br>
In case the active ingredient has poor water solubility, and an oily carrier is therefore used, proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a emulsifiers such as phospholipids, e.g. lecithin or one of a variety of other<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable emulsifiers. As known per se, the proper choice if a surfactant and the treatment conditions may also permit to control the particle size of the emulsion droplets.<br>
Suitable soaps for use in parenteral formulations, in case the active ingredient has poor water solubility, include fafiy alkali metal, ammonium, and triethanolamine salts, and suitable detergents include oleic acid, stearic acid, and isostearic acid. Ethyl oleate and isopropyl myristate are examples of suitable fatty acid esters.<br>
Suitable detergents for use in parenteral formulations include fatty alkali metal, ammonium, and triethanolamine salts, and suitable detergents include (a) cationic detergents such as, for example, dimethyl dialkyl ammonium halides, and alkyl pyridinium halides, (b) anionic detergents such as, for example, alkyl, aryl, and olefin sulfonates, alkyl, olefin, ether, and monoglyceride sulfates, and sulfosuccinates, (c) nonionic detergents such as, for example, fatty amine oxides, fatty acid alkanolamides, and polyoxy- ethylenepolypropylene copolymers, (d) amphoteric detergents such as, for example, alkyl-b-aminopriopionates, and 2-alkyl-imidazoline quaternary ammonium salts, and (3) mixtures thereof.<br>
Further, in order to minimize or eliminate irritation at the site of injection, me compositions may contain one or more nonionic surfactants having a hydrophile-lipophile balance (HLB) of from about 12 to about 17. Suitable surfactants include polyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters, such as sorbitan monooleate and the high molecular weight adducts of ethylene oxide with a hydrophobic base, formed by the condensation of propylene oxide with propylene glycol.<br>
The choice of an additive will be determined in part by the particular compound of the present invention, as well as by the particular method used to administer the composition.<br>
-19-<br>
Notwithstanding the above, the composition of the present invention may include one or more of the compounds of the present invention and may be comprise other biologically active substances, to provide a combined therapeutic effect<br>
The compounds and compositions of the present invention as set forth hereinabove and below are administered and dosed in accordance with good medical practice, taking into account the clinical conditions of the individual patient, the site and method of administration, scheduling of administration, individual's age, sex, body weight and other factors known to medical practitioners. The dose may be single doses or multiple doses over a period of several days. The treatment generally has a length proportional to the length of the disease process and drug effectiveness and the individual species being treated. Suitable doses and dosage regimens can be determined by conventional range-finding techniques known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Generally, treatment is initiated with smaller dosages, which are less than the optimum dose of the compound. Thereafter, the dosage is increased by small increments, until the optimum effect under the circumstances is reached. Exemplary dosages range from about 0.001 mg/kg body weight to about 10mg/kg body weight of the subject being treated/day.<br>
Some of the new compounds of the invention are agonists of the A1 adenosine receptor ("Al Agonist") some others are agonists of the A2 adenosine receptor ("A2 Agonist") and some others are agonists of the A3 adenosine receptor ("A3 Agonist"). Some of the compounds may also have agonistic activity to more than one of these adenosine receptors. Additionally, some of them show full agonistic activity and some show partial agonistic activity. Thus, different compounds of the invention may have different therapeutic applications based on their different agonistic activity. The agonistic activity for a specific compound may be determined based on its binding properties and on its biological effect. For example, it is known that A3 agonists can inhibit proliferation of tumor cells on the<br>
one hand and induce proliferation of white blood cells and neutrophils on the other hand (see WO01/19360). Thus, to determine whether a compound has an A3 agonistic activity, it may be incubated in vitro with tumor cells and with white blood cells and measure cell proliferation in order to show its dual effect on said cells. Furthermore, a compound shown to have an A3 agonistic activity in vitro may then be administered to animals using appropriate animal models (see WO01/19360) to determine its in vivo effect<br>
Similarly, Al agonists are known to induce proliferation of white blood cells but, unlike A3 agonists, do not inhibit proliferation of tumor cells. Thus, an assay similar to that disclosed above, compounds of Al agonistic activity may be determined.<br>
For example, compounds that have either Al or A3 agonistic activity may be used for protection against drug-induced myelotoxicity. Compounds, having an A3 agonistic activity may be used for anti-cancer agents.<br>
Compounds with A2 agonistic activity are known to be active as neuroleptic agents, e.g. for the treatment of psychosis, or for wound healing. Thus, appropriate models to test such activity may be used in order to evaluate whether a given compound is an A2 agonist<br>
Additionally, various binding assays known per se may also be used in order to determine affinity of the compounds to any one of the adenosine receptors.<br>
The therapeutic utility for a given compound can thus be determined based on such assays.<br>

Obviously, many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teaching. It is therefore, to be understood that within the scope of the<br>

Biological Evaluation<br>
All compounds were tested in radioligand binding assays to determine their affinities for the adenosine Ai receptor in rat brain cortex, the A2A receptor in rat striatum and the human A3 receptor as expressed in HEK 293 cells (Table 2). For the adenosine Ai receptor, the tritiated antagonist, [ H]-l,3-dipropyl-8-cyclopentylxanthine ([3H]DPCPX), and for the adenosine A2A receptor, the tritiated antagonist [3H]ZM 241385 were used.

All compounds were also tested in functional assays. The ability of the compounds (1,3,4,33-40 and 45-48) to either stimulate cAMP production through human adenosine A2A receptors expressed in CHO cells or inhibit the cAMP production in human adenosine A3 receptors expressed in HEK 293 cells was assessed.<br>
Results and Discussion<br>
In a first attempt to synthesize the compounds of the invention 2-iodoadenosine (1) was used as the starting material . It was noted that the 2-substituent should preferably be introduced prior to the 5'-substkuent, since the latter was mostly varied. Substitution of the 2-iodo group of compound 1 with the desired substituents was quite straightforward. The 2-(N'-3-methyl-l-butylidenehydrazino) derivative (3) was synthesized by the condensation Of 2-hydrazinoadenosine (2) with isovaleraldehyde.7 The complete conversion of the iodo-nucleoside to its 2-(l-hexynyl) derivative (4) was carried out by a modification of the traditional palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction.8 However, subsequent introduction of a good leaving group at the 5'-position of compounds 2-4 foiled. Chlorine was preferred as leaving group, since the high reactivities of a P-toluenesulfonyl or methanesulfonyl group can cause ring closure with the adenine part23 An improved chlorination method as described by Robins and co-workers20 to introduce chlorine at the 5'-position, has been successfully used before.5 In this procedure the formation of a diastereomeric sulfite ester, readily hydrolyzed in aqueous methanolic, ammonia, renders the protection of the 2'- and 3'-hydroxyl groups unnecessary. However, when applied to compounds 2,-3 and 4 the desired7 products 5, 6 and 7 were not obtained. Different amounts of SOCb and different temperatures either led to decomposition of the starting material (2) or resulted in the addition of chlorine to the multiple bond of the C2-substituent (3 or 4) besides 5'-chlorination. It was thus concluded that the reaction conditions of this chlorination method were too harsh. The conditions of another<br>
-41-<br>
chlorination method described to selectively halogenate the 5'-position of different unprotected nucleosides by using carbon tetrahalides and triphenylphosphuie,24 appeared to be too mild. Straightforward mild Mitsunobu reaction conditions were tried as well, first applied to commercially available guanosine and adenosine. However, reaction conditions for selective 5'-chlorination only were difficult to control. Reaction with guanosine (-10°C for 1 hour) led to chlorination of all three hydroxyl groups, while similar conditions (-10°C for 15-30 minutes) left adenosine unreacted. In another route mild chlorination methods without interference of the 2'- and 3'- hydroxyl groups were explored by using partly protected starting materials. For this purpose, 2',3'-O-isopropylidene-2-iodoadenosine was successfully prepared by reaction of 2-iodoadenosine (1) with acetone and 70% HCIO4 as acid catalyst,25 and the 2-(l~hexynyl) group was introduced as described above to yield 2-(l-hexynyl)-2',3'-Oisopropylideneadenosine. Chlorination of 2-(l-hexynyl)-2',3'-0-isopropyhdeneadenosine using CCU and PPb.3 as described by Homma et al,25 yielded the chlorinated compound, but in a low 15% yield only. Unfortunately, problems were encountered in the next reaction. Several attempts to convert 5'-deoxy-2-(l-hexynyI)-5*-chloro-25,3'-0-isopropylideneadenosine into the 5'-(ethyltiuo)-substituted derivative by reaction with ethanethiol in either KOtBu in MeOH or 2 M NaOH1 did not succeed. "With the former procedure only starting material was obtained again, even after 5 hours at 95°C. The latter method caused significant decomposition and neither starting material nor product were obtained.<br>
In yet another route the 5'-substituent was introduced prior to C2-substitution to circumvent all problems met in the previous routes. The method of Robins20 yielded 5'-deoxy-2-iodo-5'-chloroadenosine from 2-iodoadenosine (1). However, besides the 5'-hydroxyl group, also the 2-iodo group of 1 was replaced by chlorine to some extent, and a mixture of 5'-deoxy-2-iodo-5'-chloroadenosine with 2,5'-dichloro-5'-deoxyadenosine was obtained. Separation of the two products by column chromatography proved impossible. Thus, it was necessary to go further back in the synthesis route, since pure 2,5'-dichIoro-5,-deoxyadenosine, obtained<br>
-42-<br>
by chlorination of 2-chloroadenosine, failed to react with ethanethiol under different conditions (either with KOtBu in MeOH at different temperatures that all regained starting material, or in 2 M NaOH at elevated temperatures yielding the 2,5'-diethylthio substituted derivatives). Finally, in Scheme 1 the successful synthesis of the desired compounds is depicted. The 5'-substituents were introduced at guanosine, which is also the precursor of 2-iodoadenosine (1). Although more laborious, this route starts with the introduction of the 5'-alkylthio substituents at guanosine to circumvent all described problems. CWorination 20 of guanosine gave 5'-chloro-5'-deoxy-guanosine (16) in 93% yield. Compound 16 was reacted with the appropriate thiol in 2 M NaOH1,5 and the 2'- and 3'- hydroxyl groups of compounds 17-20 were subsequently protected to yield the 2',3'-O-acetyl-5'-alkylthio)-substituted derivatives 21-24. Several laboratories have described chtorination on the 6-position of purine nucleosides with phosphoryl chloride (POCb).18,21 To prevent decomposition of the starting materials, the chemicals used were either properly dried or freshly distilled, and compounds 25-28 were obtained in reasonable to good yields (40%-74%). Subsequently, the 2-amino group of compounds 25-28 was replaced by iodine. The method used was a variation of the originally dia2otization-iodine substitution procedure. With this efficient method 29-32 were obtained in good yields (71 - 82%). Stirring 29-32 in ethanol freshly saturated with NH3 readily removed the protecting groups and slowly aminated the 6-position to give the intermediates 33-36. NMR showed that amination at the 6-position needed stirring at room temperature for at least two days. Subsequent introduction of the C2-substituents was done as described above,7,8 and compounds 37-40 and 45-48 were obtained in good yields.<br>
Table 2 displays radioligand binding data for all synthesized final products 1, 3, 4, 33-40 and 45-48. In the Table, the substituents are as defined herein (with R3 being a hydrogen), with reference to the compound of general formula (I).<br>
-43-<br>
From this table it is clear that most compounds had very low or negligible affinity for the adenosine A1 receptor. Also, most compounds did not show any preference in binding at either the adenosine A2A or the A3 receptor, with reasonable to good affinities for both receptor subtypes. Some compounds were slightly selective for the adenosine A2A receptor (3, 4) with an A2a/A3 selectivity ratio significantly smaller than unity, while other compounds favored the adenosine A3 receptor more (1, 33-34, 38, 48) with an A2A/A3 selectivity ratio up to 15-fold (33). Substitution at the 2-position is known to increase selectivity for the adenosine A2A receptor.7-8 More recently, radioligand binding studies of 2-(ar)alkynyl-substituted adenosine derivatives have shown that besides A1/A2A<br>
-44-<br>
selectivity, also A1/A3 selectivity is increased by these 2-substituents.9-10-27 Indeed, the 2-(l-hexynyl) substituent induced high affinity for both the adenosine A2A and A3 receptor compared to the Ai receptor. High affinities for both the adenosine A2A and the A3 receptor were also obtained with the 2-(iV-3-methyIbutyUdenhydrazino) derivatives, which had previously been tested in functional assays for the adenosine A1 and A2A receptot only.7 The 2-(l-hexynyl) derivatives (4,37-40) had the highest affinities for both the adenosine A2A and A3 receptor, compared to the 2-(N'-3-methylbutyUdene)hydrazino and 2-iodo substituted compounds. Compound 4 had the highest affinity for the adenosine A2a receptor (Ki value of 6 nM), while compound 37 had the highest affinity for the adenosine A3 receptor (Ki value of 14.5 nM). The adenosine A2A receptor is known to accommodate only C2<br>
substituents with a restrained spacer.28 This explains the rather low affinities of the 2-iodo derivatives (1, 33-36) for this receptor, and the good affinities of the compounds with larger C2 substituents (1-hexynyl or N'-3-methylbutylidenehydrazino) that contain a relatively rigid spacer. The affinities of the 2-iodo derivatives for the adenosine A3 receptor are significantly better.than for the A2A receptor, indicating that the C2 region of the adenosine A3 receptor might be less restrained.<br>
Although the 5'-substituents were primarily shown to induce partial agonism, they also had an effect on the affinity of the compounds. A similar change in affinity was observed for both the adenosine A2A and the A3 receptor. On most occasions, a bulky 5'-substituent led to a decrease in affinity for both receptor subtypes. Only in the 5'-substituted 2-iodoadenosine series (1, 33-36) adenosine A2A receptor affinity seemed to increase with a bulky substituent. The 5'-hydroxyl derivatives 1, 3 and 4, had the highest affinity for both the adenosine A2A and the A3 receptor, whereas the compounds with the relatively large 5'-propylthio and 5'-isopropylthio substituents had the lowest affinity for the two receptor subtypes. Within the 2-iodoadenosine series increasing size of the 5'-substituent led to a 10-fold increase in A3/A2A selectivity. On the other hand, within the 2-( 1-hexynyl) and<br>
-45-<br>
2-(N'-3-methylbutylidenehydrazino) series, the larger 5'-substituents increased adenosine A3 selectivity, with a 9- and 10-fold decrease of A3/A2A selectivity, respectively. This is in line with previously reported data on N6,5'-disubstituted adenosine derivatives.5 There too, the introduction of 5'-alkylthio substituents at adenosine derivatives increased the selectivity for the adenosine A3 receptor compared to the A2A receptor. Steric effects appear not to be the explanation for the decrease in adenosine A2A receptor affinity, since the size of, in particular; the 5'-ethylthio group fairly matches that of a 5'-N-ethylcarboxamido substituent, as in NECA and CGS21680. While MECA is known to have a higher affinity for the adenosine A3 receptor than NECA,29 me results presented herein suggest that the adenosine A3 receptor is better able to accommodate larger 5'-alkylthio groups than the A2A receptor. In literature, modifications other than 5'alkyllhio and 5'-N-alkylcarboxamido have been investigated for their affinities for the adenosine A2A or A3 receptor. Mogensen et ah have shown that the relatively large 3-isoxazolyl substituent at the 5'-position of adenosine derivatives indeed decreases adenosine A2A receptor affinity compared to its 5'-N-methylcarboxamido derivative. On the contrary, for poly-substituted adenosine derivatives with a 5-isoxazoIyl substituent, it has been claimed that these compounds have a very high adenosine A2A receptor affinity and that they are selective compared to A3.<br>

In parentheses the concentration at which the effect was determined (pM, approx. 100 x Ki value); c: not active (no cAMP produced at 30 uM (35) or 100 uM; approx. 100 x Ki value)<br>
All compounds were first tested at concentrations of 1-100 uM (25 to 166 times the Ki value), for determination of the amount of cAMP produced via the adenosine A2A receptor. For compounds 1,4,37-40,3 and 45-48 full dose-response curves were recorded next. The Emax values were determined from the fitted curves and compared to the maximal amount of cAMP (Emax) produced by the reference full agonist, CGS21680 (10 uM).<br>

Surprisingly, the 5'-substituted 2-iodo derivatives 33-36 did not produce any cAMP. This suggested either that they behaved as antagonists in this assay, or that they were substrates for adenosine deaminase (ADA) present in the assay. The latter explanation is however unlikely, since these compounds did not seem to be substrates for ADA in the cAMP assay for the adenosine A3 receptor, in which ADA was present as well. All adenosine derivatives (1, 3 and 4) produced similar amounts of cAMP as the mil agonist CGS 21680, suggesting that they behaved as full agonists. The 5'-substituted derivatives within the 2-(l-hexyn-l-yl) series were partial agonists compared to 4 and CGS 21680. The 5'-substituted 2-(N'-3-memylbutylidenehydrazino) derivatives showed a similar trend in cAMP production, although with higher efficacies. The efficacies of compounds 46 and 47 were similar to that of the full agonist CGS21680 and thus 46 and 47 behaved as full agonists for this receptor. Overall, most of the C2,5'-disubstituted adenosine derivatives behaved as partial agonists for the adenosine A2A receptor in this assay. The compounds with either a 5'-ethylthio or a 5'-/-propylthio substituent (37, 40, 45 and 48) had the lowest efficacies. The EC50 values for the adenosine A2A receptor were up to 54-fold higher than the Ki values. The rank orders of potency and affinity were identical, however. It must be noted that the EC50 values were determined for the human adenosine A2A receptor expressed.in CHO cells, whereas<br>
the Ki values were determined on rat striatum.32<br>
The ability of the compounds to inhibit forskolin-stimulated (10 uM) cAMP production via the adenosine A3 receptor was also studied. All compounds were tested at a single (final) concentration of 3-100 uM (73 to 200 times the Ki value). The 2-iodo substituted derivatives (1,33-36) inhibited the forskolin-induced cAMP production via the adenosine A3 receptor; proof of the agonistic character of the compounds that were silent on the adenosine A2a receptor. Compounds 1 and 4, with an intact 5'-hydroxyl group, showed almost full inhibition of the cAMP production comparable with the reference full agonist Cl-IB-MECA. Compound 3 only gave 24% inhibition of the cAMP production, indicating that it behaved as a<br>
-48-<br>
partial agonist for the adenosine A3 receptor. The 5'-substituted derivatives all showed submaximal levels of inhibition of the forskolin-induced cAMP roduction, with the same trend within the three 2-substituted series (Table 3). This indicates that the di-substituted adenosine derivatives were all partial agonists for the adenosine A3 receptor in tins assay. The compounds with the 5'-methylthio substituent (33,37, 45) had the highest intrinsic efficacies, whereas the compounds with a relatively large S'-substituent (ra-propylthio, 35 and 39) had the lowest intrinsic activities for the adenosine A3 receptor.<br>

Biology-General<br>
Radioligand Rinding Studies Measurements with [3H]DPCPX in the absence of GTP were performed according to a protocol published previously (rat Ai).33 Adenosine A2A receptor (rat) affinities were determined according to Gao et a/.34 Adenosine A3 receptor affinities were determined essentially as described.' Briefly, assays were performed in 50/10/1 buffer (50 mM Tris/10 mM MgCfe/1 mM emylenediaminetetra-acetic acid (EDTA) and 0.01% 3-([3-cholamidopropyl]-dimethylarnmonio)-l-propanesulfonate (CHAPS)) in glass tubes and contained 50 uL of a HEK 293 cell membrane suspension (10-30 ^g), 25 uj [,25I]AB MECA (final concentration 0.15 nM), and 25 ul of ligand. Incubations were carried out for 1 hr at 37°C and were terminated by rapid filtration over Whatman GF/B filters, using a Brandell cell harvester (Brandell, Gaithersburg, MD). Tubes were washed<br>
-65-<br>
three times with 3 ml of buffer. Radioactivity was determined in a Beckman 5500B y-counter. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10-5 M R-PIA.<br>
cAMP assay A1 and A3 CHO cells expressing either the human adenosine Ai or A3 receptor were grown overnight as a monolayer in 24 wells tissue culture plates (400 id/well; 2x10s cells/well). cAMP generation was performed in Dulbecco's Modified Eagles Medium (DMEM)/N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazin-N'-2-emansulfonic acid (HEPES) buffer (0.60 g HEPES/ 50 ml DMEM pH 7.4). To each well, washed two times with DMEM/HEPES buffer (250 ul), 100 ul adenosine deaminase (final concentration 5 IU/ml), 100 ul of a mixture of rolipram and cilostamide (final concentration each 50 uM) and 100 ul agonist (final concentration ± 100 times the K1 value) were added. After incubation for 40 minutes at 37°C, 100 ul forskolin (final concentration 10 uM) was added. After 15 minutes at 37°C, the reaction was terminated by removing the medium and adding 200 uL 0.1 M HC1. Wells were stored at -20°C until assay.<br>
The amounts of cAMP were determined after a protocol with cAMP binding protein with the following minor modifications. As a buffer was used 150mM K2HPO4/IO mM EDTA / 02% Bovine Serum Albumine (BSA) at pH 7.5. Samples (20 ul+30 ul 0.1 M HC1) were incubated for at least 2.5 hours at 0°C before filtration over Whatman GF/B filters. Filters were additionally rinsed with 2 x 2 ml TrisHCl buffer (pH 7.4, 4°C). Filters were counted in Packard Emulsifier Safe scintillation fluid (3.5 ml) after 24 hours of extraction.<br>
Data Analysis Apparent K* and ECso values were computed from the displacement curves by nonlinear regression of the competition curves with the software package Prism voraph Pad, San Dieg^ CA).<br>
All compounds were tested in radiolig i binding assays to determine their affinities for the adenosine Ai receptor in rat brain cortex, the A2A receptor in rat striatum and the human A3 receptor as expressed in HEK 293 cells (Table 5). For the adenosine Ai receptor, the tritiated antagonist, [ H]-l,3-dipropyI-8-<br>
-66-<br>
cyclopentybcanthine ([ H]DPCPX), and for the adenosine Am receptor, the tritiated antagonist [3H]ZM 241385 were used. [125I]AB-MECA, an A3 receptor agonist, was also used. Displacement experiments were performed in the absence of GTP.<br>
All compounds were also tested in functional assays. First, the ability of the compounds (66-53) to inhibit fee forskolin (lOuM) induced cAMP production via human adenosine adenosine Ai receptors expressed in CHO cells or by human adenosine A3 receptors expressed in HEK. 293 cells was assessed. Second, the modulation of guanosine^5'-
Results and discussion<br>
Selective alkylation at the 5'-position of adenosine, or one of its derivatives, is rather difficult, since one must be very careful to prevent alkylation at the more reactive nitrogen atoms present in fee base moiety (except for fee rf nitrogen, which is less reactive). Treatment of either 2',3'-0-isopropylideneadenosine or 2',3'-0-isopropytideneinosine wife KOH, 18-crown-6 and iodomefeane5 ^ yielded the Nl-mefeylated derivative or a mixture of fee Nl-methylated product together with the Nl,5'-dimethylated one, respectively. Refluxing a 5'-chloro-5'-deoxyadenosine derivative in methanolate regained only starting material. Therefore, alkylation of the ribose first, and then coupling the produt to fee appropriate heterocyclic base was selected as the preferred procedure and isubsequently perform other reactions.<br>
Protection of the 1-, 2- and 3-hydroxyl groups of D-ribose (49) was performed according to a method described by Leonard et al.48 with a modification. D-ribose was dissolved in a mixture of acetone, MeOH and 2,2-dimethoxypropane,<br>
-67-<br>
and HC1 gas was bubbled directly through the solution, instead of adding MeOH saturated with HC1 gas. The protected p-sugar (50) was obtained in good yield (95%). For alkylation of the 5-hydroxyl group, 50 was dissolved in DMF andNaH under cooling (not in the case of cyclopropylbromide), and the appropriate alkylhalide was added at room temperature. Compounds 51-53 were obtained in 38-97% yield.<br>
In general, benzoyl protecting groups at the 2-, 3- and 5-position of the sugar moiety have been used to improve the formation of p-nucleosides over ct-nucleosides in me glycosylation reaction, i.e. when the protected sugar is coupled to a heterocyclic base. Hence, the isopropylidene. protecting group of 51 -was removed to obtain the methyl 5-O-methyl-D-ribofuranoside derivative. Subsequent treatment with benzoylchloride in CH2CI2 and pyridine yielded the desired methyl 2,3-di-0-berizoyl-5-0-methyl-D-ribofuranoside, although is was difficult to remove<br>
52<br>
the excess of benzoylchloride. The conversion of the 1-O-methyl group into a 1-O-acetyl group succeeded in reasonable yield by treatment of methyl 2,3-di-O-benzoyl-5-O-memyl-D-ribofuranoside with acetic acid, acetic anhydride and sulfuric acid.52 Since this method is quite laborious, the possibility of using a fully acetyl protected sugar was explored as well. Removal of the protecting groups of compounds 51-53 with aqueous sulfuric acid (0.02 M) and EtOH gave, besides the desired product, also a significant amount of the l-

From this table, it is evident that most compounds had lower affinity for the<br>
adenosine A2A receptor than for the adenosine Ai or A3 receptors. Compounds with<br>
an unsubstituted N6 amino group (66, 69, 72, 75, 78, 81) showed adenosine A3<br>
receptor selectivity compared to Ai, with A1/A3 selectivity ratios ranging from 4.1<br>
-70-<br>
for compound 66 to 98.7 for compound 72. A cyclopentyl group at the Apposition induced high adenosine Ai receptor affinities and also the highest selectivity for the Ai receptor, whereas the J\r-(3-iodobenzyl) adenosine derivatives had the highest adenosine A3 receptor affinities and were highly selective for this receptor, in line with earlier reports on these iV?-substituents.1A5 In general, the adenosine Ai receptor affinities were unchanged or increased (up to 2-fold) when a chlorine was introduced at the 2-position, with a concomitant slight increase in adenosine Ai receptor selectivity (up to 4-fold). The introduction of chlorine at the 2-position had more variable effects on the affinity and selectivity for the adenosine A3 receptor. The adenosine A3 receptor affinities of the Ar-unsubstituted derivatives were slightly increased, whereas for the i^-(3-iodobenzyl) substituted compounds they were decreased somewhat The selectivity for the adenosine A3 receptor was decreased up to approx. 4-fold, when chlorine was introduced at C2. The effect of chlorine at the 2-position on receptor affinity was difficult to predict in the case of substituted adenosines. It has been shown that for both CPA and N6-(3-iodobenzyl)adenosine the affinity and selectivity for the adenosine Ai receptor is increased when compared to the A2A receptor.54 However, when chlorine was introduced at the 2-position of 5'-N-memylcarboxamido-substituted 7\r~(3-iodobenzyl) adenosine the affinity for both the adenosine Ai and A2A receptors was decreased, while A3 receptor affinity increased. On the contrary, in the present study introduction of chlorine at the 2-position of 5'-0-alkyI substituted derivatives slightly decreased adenosine A3 receptor selectivity of the compounds compared to the Ai receptor.<br>
The 5'-substituents also influenced the affinity and selectivity of the compounds. For the adenosine Ai receptor the compounds with a 5'-C*-methyi group had the highest receptor affinities, whereas the 5'-Ocyclopropyl substituted derivatives displayed the lowest affinities in most cases. Only within the Ar,C2-unsubtituted series (66, 72, 78) 5'-0-ethyl-adenosine had the lowest affinity for the adenosine Ai receptor. In case of the adenosine A3 receptor, the derivatives with a<br>
-71-<br>
5'-0-ethyl substituent had the highest receptor affinities. The adenosine A3 receptor affinities of the 5'-0-methyl substituted derivatives were equal or somewhat higher than the 5'-0-cyclopropyl substituted ones. Although a 5'-0-cyclopropyl group is tolerated fairly well on both the adenosine Ai and A3 receptor (K; values in the low nanomolar range), smaller groups seemed to be preferred, e.g. 5'-0-methyI for the adenosine Ai receptor and 5*-0-ethyl for the A3 receptor. Hie S'-O-methyl group induced the highest adenosine Ai receptor selectivity in most cases (within the series containing the same iV6- and C2- substituents), whereas the 5'-0-cycIopropyl induced most often the highest adenosine A3 receptor selectivity compared to Ai. The compounds with a 5'-0-ethyl substituent had higher affinities than those with a 5'-0-methyl for the adenosine A3 receptor, and had the highest selectivity for this receptor in most cases as well, compared to the A2A receptor. Although MECA has been described to have higher affinity (and selectivity) than NECA for the adenosine A3 receptor compared to the A2A receptor, as demonstrated herein the adenosine A3 receptor accommodates the rather large 5'-alkylthio substituents better than the smaller ones (5'-methylthio). The results disclosed herein show that the adenosine A3 receptor is well capable of accommodating large 5'-substituents. Finally, compound 74 displayed a higher affinity for the adenosine A3 receptor (Kj value of 3.3 nM) than both reference compounds IB-MECA and 2-Cl-ffi-MECA, although its selectivity for the adenosine A3 compared to the Ai receptor was somewhat less.<br>

Table 6 shows that compounds within the three N6-substituted series showed similar trends in inhibition of the forskolin-induced cAMP production via the adenosine Ai receptor. Compounds with an intact amino group at the 6-position and the .Ar-cyclopentyl substituted derivatives were able to inhibit the cAMP production to a similar extent, almost as well as the reference full agonist CPA, whereas the N6-(3-iodobenzyl) substituted derivatives inhibited the forskolin-induced cAMP production somewhat less. Compound 68 had a lower intrinsic activity than compounds 66 and 67, while only the N6-substituent is different,<br>
-73-<br>
implicating that a 3-iodobenzyl group at TV6 can induce partial agonism for the adenosine Ai receptor. Furthermore, within the three N6-substituted series the 5'-0-methyl substituted derivatives had highest intrinsic activities compared to the 5'-0-ethyl and 5'-0-cyclopropyl substituted ones. The latter compounds displayed the lowest intrinsic activities and behaved as partial agonists for the adenosine Ai receptor in this assay. Here, the effect of the chlorine at the C2-position on the intrinsic activity is not unambiguous.<br>

Materials<br>
Compounds 34,37,69 and 70 were dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and further diluted either in RPMI (for in vitro studies) or in PBS (for the in vivo studies).<br>
Methods<br>
G-CSF in human cord blood<br>
Human cord blood samples were collected from delivery room immediately after birth. Experiments were performed in accordance with the guidelines established by the Institutional Helsinky Committee at the Rabin Medical Center, Petah Tikva, Israel. The sample was loaded on ficoll histopaque in equal volume and centrifuged for 20 minutes at 1700 RPM. Mononuclear cells were collected, wash twice with PBS and incubated (1.5xl06 cell/ml) in RPMI supplemented with 20% of Human AB serum and 50 mM of the various compounds for 48hr. Supernatants were collected, aliquoted and stored in -20°C. The level of G-CSJF was measured using a commercial human ELISA kit (R&amp;D systems, Minneapolis, MN)-<br>
Bone marrow cells proliferation assay<br>
Bone marrow cells were obtained from the femur of ICR mice. Cells were disaggregated by passing mem through a 25G needle. Cells (3x10 /well) were<br>
-74-<br>
incubated with RPMI medium, containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Biological Industries, Beit Haemek, Israel), in 96 microtiter plates for 48hr, in the presence of the various compounds, at concentration of lOuM. Cultures containing cells suspended in RPMI medium and 10% FBS served as control. In the last 18 hours of incubation, each well was pulsed with luCi 3[H]-thymidine after which cells were harvested and 3[H]-thymidine uptake was determined in an LKB liquid scintillation counter (LKB, Piscataway, NJ, USA).<br>
In vivo studies<br>
To examine the capability of the various compounds to elevate hematological parameters like the White Blood cells (WBC) and absolute neutrophil counts (ANC), the compounds were given to naive mice orally twice a day (each dose 150ug/kg body weight) for two consecutive days. Blood samples were withdrawn 48 following the last compounds administration. White blood cells counts were carried out in a Coulter counter and differential cell counts were performed on smear preparations stained with May-Grunvald-Giemsa solution. Also serum samples were colleted for G-CSF measurements as described above.<br>
Results and discussion<br>
. Compounds 34, 37, 69 and 70 were evaluated for their activity as agonists of the Al or A3 adenosine receptor, by determining their in vitro and in vivo effect on G-CSF production, as well as their effect of the proliferation of bone marrow cells, white blood cells and neutrophil cells.<br>
Fig. 1 shows that the tested compounds were capable of inducing G-CSF production in vitro as compared to the control (no drug). The inducing effect was at times to a level similar to that obtained with the known A3 receptor agonist, IB-MECA.<br>
In addition, the tested compounds were shown to induce bone marrow cell proliferation as determined by 3[H]-thymidine incorporation in cells incubated<br>
-75-<br>
with the different compounds or with IB-MECA (as a positive control). The results are presented in Fig. 2.<br>
In vivo effect of the tested compounds is presented in Fig. 3A, 3B and 3C. In particular, when the tested compounds were provided orally to mice, the levels of white blood cells, neutrophils and serum G-CSF were elevated as a result of the treatment.<br>
The above results suggest that the tested compounds, i.e. compounds 34, 36, 69 and 70 may be agonists of the A1 or A3 adenosine receptor and thus have a therapeutic utility, e.g. in protecting against drug-induced myelotoxicity.<br>
