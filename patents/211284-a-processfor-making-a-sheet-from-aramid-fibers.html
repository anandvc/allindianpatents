SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a process for making<br>
sheets with aramid fibers comprising the steps of: a)<br>
establishing a fiber dispersion under forces of<br>
agitation comprising aramid fibers and water.wherein<br>
the aramid fibers are present at a concentration of<br>
0.001 to 5 weight percent of the total dispersion and<br>
the water has a pH of greater than 10 to uniformly<br>
disperse the aramid fibers; and b) removing water from<br>
the dispersion through a porous support to form a wet-<br>
laid sheet with the aramid fibers.<br>
The invention also relates to dispersions of<br>
aramid fibers in water having a pH of greater than 10<br>
and to a process for making such dispersions.<br>
Accordingly, there is provided a process for making a sheet<br>
from aramid fibers comprising the steps of:<br>
a) establishing a fiber dispersion under forces of<br>
agitation comprising aramid fibers and water<br>
wherein the aramid fibers are present at a<br>
concentration of 0.001 to 5 weight percent of the<br>
total dispersion and the water has a pH of<br>
greater than 10 to uniformly disperse the<br>
aramid fibers; and<br>
b) removing water from the dispersion through a<br>
porous support to form a wet-laid sheet with the<br>
aramid fibers.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Manufacture of aramid sheets exhibiting<br>
increased uniformity of thickness and uniformity of<br>
opacity has long been an object of workers in this<br>
field. It has been understood that aramid fibers,<br>
known generally as floc and pulp, which are used in the<br>
manufacture of aramid sheets, tend to agglomerate under<br>
traditional sheetmaking conditions, yielding blotchy<br>
sheets which are nonuniform as to opacity and<br>
thickness.<br>
Aramid fibers in aqueous dispersion have a<br>
distinct tendency to form clumps. It has been<br>
discovered, however, that aramid fibers form uniform<br>
and relatively complete dispersions in water of pH<br>
greater than 10. The process of this invention is<br>
based on the fact that uniform sheets are made from<br>
uniform fiber dispersions and on the discovery that<br>
fiber dispersions of increased uniformity, for aramid<br>
fibers, can be made at a pH of greater than 10.<br>
With regard to the aramid fibers used in the<br>
process of this invention, by "floc" is meant small<br>
fibers of aramid material having a length of 0.5 to 15<br>
millimeters and a diameter of 4 to 50 micrometers,<br>
preferably a length of 1 to 12 millimeters and a<br>
diameter of 8 to 40 micrometers. It has been found<br>
that floc which is more than about 15 millimeters is<br>
more likely to entangle and form irreducible strings in<br>
the dispersion. Floc which is shorter than 0.5<br>
millimeter is less effective and is difficult to<br>
produce. Floc is generally made by cutting filaments<br>
of aramid fiber, such as those prepared by processes<br>
described in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,063,966; 3,133,138;<br>
3,767,756; and 3,869,430.<br>
By "pulp" is meant small fibers of aramid<br>
material having fibrils extending therefrom wherein the<br>
fiber diameter is generally 4 to 50 micrometers, the<br>
fibril diameter is only a fraction of a micrometer or a<br>
few micrometers, and the fibril length is 10 to 100.<br>
In sheet manufacture, the fibrils on pulp are important<br>
to act as hooks or fasteners to hold adjacent particles<br>
in the sheet and provide integrity to the sheet<br>
construction. The aramid pulp is made by refining floc<br>
or can be made directly from ingredients as was taught<br>
in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,202,184.and 5,532,059. <br>
Sheets can also be made using a combination of<br>
aramid fibers and fibrids wherein the fibrids serve as<br>
a binder to hold together the fibers and the other<br>
sheet components. Fibrids can be made from<br>
thermoplastic materials and from aramids. When fibrids<br>
are used, aramid fibrids are preferred for practice of<br>
this invention. Fibrids are not fibers. The term<br>
"aramid fibrids" refers to non-granular film-like<br>
particles of aromatic polyamide having a melting point<br>
or decomposition point above 320°C. The fibrids have<br>
an average length of 0.2 to 1 mm with a length-to-width<br>
aspect ratio of 5:1 to 10:1. The thickness dimension<br>
is on the order of a fraction of a micron. Fibrids are<br>
generally used in an undried form and can be deposited<br>
as a binder physically entwined about the aramid fiber<br>
component of a sheet. The fibrids in sheets of this<br>
invention can be prepared using a fibridating apparatus<br>
of the type disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,018,091<br>
where a polymer solution is precipitated and sheared in<br>
a single step.<br>
Although the length of pulp particles is<br>
usually a direct consequence of the length of the<br>
starting floc, pulp generally has a length of about<br>
0.15 to 10 millimeters. Surface area is an important<br>
characteristic of pulp to be used in this invention<br>
because the surface area is a measure of the degree of<br>
fibrillation and influences the porosity of the sheet<br>
and the effective area available for interfiber<br>
bonding. The surface area of pulp used herein is 0.5<br>
to 20 square meters per gram, and the surface area for<br>
floc is 0.08 to 0.6 square meters per gram. Because<br>
floc lacks the fibrillation of pulp, sheets made with<br>
floc often, also, has a binder such as fibrids, among<br>
the sheet components.<br>
By "aramid" is meant a polyamide wherein at<br>
least 85% of the amide (-CO-NH-) linkages are attached<br>
directly to two aromatic rings. Additives can be used<br>
with the aramid and it has been found that up to as<br>
much as 10 percent, by weight, of other polymeric<br>
material can be blended with the aramid or that<br>
copolymers can be used having as much as 10 percent of<br>
other diamine substituted for the diamine of the aramid<br>
or as much as 10 percent of other diacid chloride<br>
substituted for the diacid chloride of the aramid.<br>
Para-aramids are the primary polymers in fibers<br>
of this invention and poly (p-phenylene<br>
terephthalamide)(PPD-T) is the preferred para-aramid.<br>
By PPD-T is meant the homopolymer resulting from mole-<br>
for-mole polymerization of p-phenylene diamine and<br>
terephthaloyl chloride and, also, copolymers resulting<br>
from incorporation of small amounts of other diamines<br>
with the p-phenylene diamine and of small amounts of<br>
other diacid chlorides with the terephthaloyl chloride.<br>
Copoly(p-phenylene/3,4"-diphenyl ether terephthalamide)<br>
is another para-aramid eligible for use in this<br>
invention.<br>
Meta-aramids are, also, important for use in<br>
the fibers of this invention and poly(m-phenylene<br>
isophthalamide) (MPD-I) is the preferred meta-aramid.<br>
By MPD-I is meant the homopolymer resulting from mole-<br>
for-mole polymerization of m-phenylene diamine and<br>
isophthaloyl chloride and, also, copolymers resulting<br>
from incorporation of small amount of other diamines<br>
with the m-phenylene diamine and of small amounts of<br>
other diacid chlorides with the isophthaloyl chloride.<br>
Fibrous sheets and fiber dispersions for making<br>
such sheets often include other components in addition<br>
to the fibers. Such components include additives such<br>
as colorants, fillers, binders, friction modifiers, and<br>
the like. Aramid fibers have been found to be<br>
difficult to disperse uniformly under the conditions<br>
usually used for sheet manufacturer. However, it has<br>
been discovered that, when aramid fibers are included<br>
as one of the components, a sheet of improved<br>
uniformity and opacity will result if the pH of the<br>
aramid fiber dispersion is adjusted to greater than 10<br>
under forces of agitation at some time before forming<br>
the dispersion into a wet-laid sheet. Aramid fibers<br>
are substantially completely dispersed at the pH of<br>
greater than 10 and, once dispersed, it has been found<br>
that other components such as talc or diatomaceous<br>
earth or carbon black in the dispersion may assist in<br>
maintaining or stabilizing the dispersion. The<br>
dispersions and sheets of this invention can include<br>
from zero up to as much as 90 weight percent of<br>
additives or components other than aramid fibers, based<br>
on the total weight of the sheet, including aramid<br>
fibers and other components. Thus, in accordance with<br>
the present invention, the sheetmaking dispersion must<br>
be adjusted to have a pH of greater than 10 in the<br>
presence of the aramid fibers of the dispersion, even<br>
if the pH of the dispersion is later reduced to less<br>
than 10 before removing water from the dispersion.<br>
Binder materials, if used in practicing the<br>
process of this invention, can be any material which<br>
assists, in the dried sheet product, to hold the fibers<br>
together. Eligible binder materials include the<br>
aforementioned aramid and thermoplastic fibrids and<br>
rubbers and elastomers in the form of latexes, and the<br>
like. Aramid fibrids are preferred binders for use<br>
with aramid floc; and latex binders are preferred for<br>
use with aramid pulp. Fibrid binders are generally-<br>
used in concentrations of 5 to 95 and latex binders are<br>
generally used in concentration of 0.25 to 95 weight<br>
percent based on the weight of the sheet being made.<br>
When a latex is used as binder material,<br>
flocculating agents such as aluminum sulfate, aluminum<br>
chlorohydrate, calcium chloride, mineral acids, and the<br>
like are added to the dispersion in such amount as to<br>
coagulate the latex binder. Aluminum sulfate is<br>
preferred.<br>
The kernel of this invention resides in<br>
adjustment of the pH of the aramid fiber dispersion to<br>
greater than 10 to uniformly disperse the aramid<br>
fibers. For reasons not entirely understood, aramid<br>
fibers in water dispersion tend to agglomerate at pH"s<br>
up to about 10 and tend to be repelled from each other<br>
and to become more completely and more uniformly<br>
dispersed at pH"s of greater than 10.<br>
As a practical matter, a pH range of 10.5 to 12<br>
is preferred for practice of this invention.<br>
Dispersions with pH greater than 12 are hazardous and<br>
difficult to handle. The pH of these dispersions can<br>
be adjusted using any convenient base or alkaline<br>
material. Most usually used materials are sodium or<br>
ammonium hydroxide.<br>
As a part of the process of this invention, an<br>
aqueous fiber dispersion is established comprising<br>
aramid fibers in water. The pH of that dispersion is<br>
adjusted to greater than 10 and water from that<br>
dispersion is removed such as by pouring the dispersion<br>
onto a porous support or screen to form a wet-laid<br>
sheet. The wet-laid sheet is dried; and that sheet is<br>
usually 5 to 95 percent aramid fibers, based on the<br>
total weight of the sheet. The aramid fibers include<br>
at least one of aramid pulp and aramid floc. The<br>
dispersion is generally 0.001 to 5 weight percent<br>
aramid fibers, based on weight of the total dispersion.<br>
The concentration of fibers in the dispersion is<br>
selected to be convenient and to afford optimized<br>
dispersion and dispersion qualities.<br>
Sheets made by the process of this invention<br>
find use as substrates for printed circuit boards,<br>
friction articles such as in clutch facing plates,<br>
thermal and electrical insulation, structural core and<br>
honeycomb material, and the like. The sheets can be<br>
pressed or calendered with heat and pressure to<br>
increase density and mechanical properties.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1<br>
An aqueous dispersion of 0.3 weight percent<br>
poly(m-phenylene diamine terephthalate) (MPD-I) floc of<br>
0.64cm length (sold by E. I. du Pont de Nemours and<br>
Company under the trade name NOMEX®) having a pH of<br>
7.44 was observed to have flocculated into "pillows"<br>
approximately 2.2cm long and 0.64cm at the widest<br>
cross-section. Sodium hydroxide was added to the<br>
dispersion under forces of agitation. The pH was<br>
initially raised to about 9.30; and the floc was<br>
partially dispersed. When the pH was raised to about<br>
10.64, the flocculated pillows were uniformly dispersed<br>
to individual floc fibers and the fibers remained<br>
dispersed indefinitely, without any indication of<br>
reflocculation.<br>
Example 2<br>
Five grams of para-aramid pulp were dispersed with<br>
a paddle stirrer in 750 gms of distilled water at 400<br>
RPM for 30 minutes. The pulp was poly(p-phenylene<br>
terephthalamide) manufactured and sold by E. I. du Pont<br>
de Nemours and Company under the tradename of KEVLAR®<br>
and had a length of 0.8 mm and a surface area of 7.5<br>
square meters per gram. The initial pH of the<br>
dispersion was measured to be 8.55. The dispersion<br>
appeared non-uniform with fiber clumps of approximately<br>
5 to 10 mm in diameter. Sodium hydroxide was added<br>
with agitation to adjust the pH to 9.04. No change in<br>
the dispersion was observed. Further sodium hydroxide<br>
was added to change the pH to 9.28. The dispersion was<br>
slightly better; but with very little separation of<br>
individual pulp particles. When the pH was adjusted to<br>
10.08, the dispersion looked much more uniform with<br>
individual pulp particles visible on the top. The pH<br>
was then increased to 10.43 and the dispersion became<br>
uniform with many individual pulp fibers and a floc<br>
size of less than 3mm.<br>
Example 3<br>
As a control, two grams of the same aramid pulp<br>
used in Example 2, above, were dispersed in 800 ml of<br>
distilled water in a 1000 ml beaker with a paddle<br>
stirrer located 6 cm from the bottom of the beaker,<br>
stirred for 5 minutes at 400 RPM followed by 60 minutes<br>
at 550 RPM. The pH was measured to be 7.75. A 170 mm<br>
diameter sheet was formed from this dispersion by<br>
filtering with a Buchner funnel under vacuum. The<br>
sheet was dried and observed by placing it on a light<br>
table. It was found to be non-uniform with many fiber<br>
clumps.<br>
Two more grams of the same pulp were dispersed in<br>
800 ml of distilled water in a 1000 ml beaker with a<br>
paddle stirrer located 6 cm from the bottom, stirred<br>
for 30 minutes at 550 RPM. The pH was measured to be<br>
7.73. The pH of the dispersion was adjusted to 10.96<br>
with sodium hydroxide. The dispersion was stirred at<br>
550 RPM for an additional 30 minutes. A 170 mm<br>
diameter sheet was formed from this dispersion by<br>
filtering with a Buchner funnel under vacuum. The<br>
sheet was dried and observed by placing it on a light<br>
table. It was found to be more uniform than the sheet<br>
made at a pH of 7.75 and had fewer fiber clumps.<br>
Example 4<br>
A paper sheet with 45 weight percent of the same<br>
pulp as was used in the previous examples, 53 weight<br>
percent diatomaceous earth filler (sold by Eagle-Picher<br>
Minerals under the tradename Celatom® MW12), 2 weight<br>
percent nitrile latex binder (sold by BF Goodrich<br>
Company under the tradename Hycar® 1562) (all dry<br>
basis percentages by weight) was prepared by mixing<br>
4.42 gms (dry basis) of the pulp in approximately 1500<br>
gms of water for 5 minutes in a disintegrator, known as<br>
a British Pulp Evaluation Apparatus available from<br>
Mavis Engineering, Ltd., London, England, followed by<br>
addition of 5.20 gms of the diatomaceous earth with<br>
mixing for another 5 minutes. The pH of the resulting<br>
dispersion was measured to be 7.30. The dispersion was<br>
mixed with a paddle stirrer at 500 RPM with addition of<br>
0.4 8 gm of the latex which was 4 0.7 weight percent<br>
solids. The pH was measured to be 7.35. With the<br>
mixer running, 6.34 gms of 6 weight percent aqueous<br>
aluminum sulfate were added to the dispersion and mixed<br>
for one minute. The dispersion pH was measured to be<br>
3.90. The dispersion was poured into an approximately<br>
210 mm X 210 mm handsheet mold containing 8000 gms of<br>
water. The slurry was stirred by hand and the pH was<br>
measured to be 4.70. The water was drained and a wet-<br>
laid sheet was formed. The sheet was placed between<br>
two pieces of blotting paper, hand couched with a<br>
rolling pin, and dried in a handsheet dryer at 190C.<br>
The sheet was observed, on a light table, to be non-<br>
uniform with fiber clumps of 30 to 40 mm as large dark<br>
areas .<br>
Another sheet with the same composition as above<br>
was made but with an adjustment of the pH, using sodium<br>
hydroxide solution, to higher levels as follows: the pH<br>
of the initial pulp dispersion was adjusted to 11.00;<br>
the pH after addition of the diatomaceous earth was<br>
11.06; and the pH after addition of the latex was<br>
11.04. With the mixer running, 7.15 gms of the 6 weight<br>
percent aluminum sulfate solution was added to the<br>
dispersion and mixed for one minute. The dispersion pH<br>
was then measured to be 4.3. The dispersion pH was<br>
then raised to 10.80 by addition of sodium hydroxide.<br>
The dispersion was poured into an approximately 210 mm<br>
X 210 mm handsheet mold containing 8000 gms of water at<br>
high pH. The slurry was stirred by hand and the pH was<br>
measured to be 11.07. The water was drained and a wet-<br>
laid sheet was formed. The sheet was placed between<br>
two pieces of blotting paper, hand couched with a<br>
rolling pin, and dried in a handsheet dryer at 190C.<br>
The sheet was observed on a light table to be more<br>
uniform than the sheet made at lower pH with most<br>
clumps less than 10 mm in size.<br>
Example 5<br>
A paper sheet with 20 weight percent of the same<br>
pulp, 75 weight percent diatomaceous earth, 4 weight<br>
percent cotton linters, and 1 weight percent nitrile<br>
latex binder was prepared as follows: 1.4 6 gms of the<br>
pulp and 0.39 gms of the cotton linters were added to<br>
approximately 1500 gms of water and were mixed for 5<br>
minutes in a disintegrator. The diatomaceous earth was<br>
added to the dispersion and mixed for another 5<br>
minutes. The dispersion pH was measured to be 7.18.<br>
Agitation of the dispersion was continued with a paddle<br>
stirrer at 500 RPM. 0.10 gm of the latex was then added<br>
to the dispersion and mixed for one minute. The pH was<br>
measured to be 7.20. With the mixer running, 1.04 gms<br>
of 6 weight percent aluminum sulfate solution was added<br>
to the dispersion and mixed for one minute. The<br>
dispersion pH was then measured to be 5.54. Sodium<br>
hydroxide was added to adjust the pH to 7.21; and the<br>
slurry was stirred at 500 rpm for about 30 minutes.<br>
The dispersion was poured into an approximately 210 mm<br>
X 210 mm handsheet mold containing 8000 gms of water.<br>
The slurry was stirred by hand and the pH measured to<br>
be 6.92. The water was drained and a wet-laid sheet<br>
was formed. The sheet was placed between two pieces of<br>
blotting paper, hand couched with a rolling pin, and<br>
dried in a handsheet dryer at 190C. The sheet was<br>
observed on a light table to be non-uniform with white<br>
areas containing a large amount of diatomaceous earth<br>
on the top side. Also, the sheet had 153 "neps" or<br>
areas of fiber clumps that showed up as dark spots when<br>
viewed on the light table.<br>
Another paper sheet was made under similar<br>
conditions as above except that the pH was adjusted to<br>
10.95 with sodium hydroxide after the aluminum sulfate<br>
addition and the dispersion was stirred for 30 minutes.<br>
The dispersion was then poured into the handsheet mold<br>
with 8000 gms of water at high pH and stirred by hand.<br>
The pH was measured to be 10.84. The water was drained<br>
and the sheet was formed, couched, and dried as above.<br>
The sheet was observed on a light table to be more<br>
uniform than the previous sheet and had only 67 "neps".<br>
The diatomaceous earth appeared to be much better<br>
distributed throughout the sheet. This example thus<br>
again illustrates the improved paper uniformity that is<br>
achieved through the use of a pH of greater than 10 in<br>
the fiber dispersion.<br>
Another paper was made under similar conditions as<br>
above except that the pH was raised to greater than 10<br>
prior to addition of aluminum sulfate and was not<br>
significantly adjusted after that. The paper was<br>
prepared as follows: pulp and cotton linters were added<br>
to approximately 1500 gms of water. Sodium Hydroxide<br>
was added to the dispersion of pulp and cotton linters<br>
to yield a pH of 11.03. The dispersion was mixed for 5<br>
minutes in a disintigrator. The diatomaceous earth was<br>
added to the dispersion and mixed for another 5<br>
minutes. The pH was measured to be 10.96. The latex<br>
was added to the dispersion and mixed for one minute.<br>
The pH was measured to be 10.93. With mixer running,<br>
5.60 gms of 6 weight percent aqueous aluminum sulfate<br>
solution was added to the dispersion and mixed for one<br>
minute. The pH was measured to be 5.74. Sodium<br>
hydroxide was added to adjust the pH to 6.8 6; and the<br>
dispersion was poured into an approximately 210 mm x<br>
210 mm handsheet mold containing 8000 gms water. The<br>
dispersion was stirred by hand and the pH measured to<br>
be 6.97. The water was drained, hand couched with a<br>
rolling pin, and dried in a handsheet dryer at 190°C.<br>
The sheet was observed on a light table to be uniform<br>
with the diatomaceous earth uniformly distributed<br>
throughout the sheet. The sheet had only 39 "neps" or<br>
areas of fiber clumps.<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
Control process:<br>
To a tank containing 62,160 liters of water, 65.3<br>
kgms of 0.64 cm-long para-aramid floc and 5,900 liters<br>
of dispersion containing 0.487 weight percent of meta-<br>
aramid fibrids were added. The para-aramid floc was a<br>
poly(para-phenylene terephthalamide) fiber product sold<br>
by E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company under the trade<br>
name KEVLAR® 29. The meta-aramid fibrids were made<br>
from poly(meta-phenylene terephthalamide) as described<br>
in U. S. Patent No. 3,756,908 and exhibited a Shopper<br>
Riefer freeness of 300 ml. The fibrids were used as a<br>
binder for the paper. The resulting dispersion had a<br>
pH of 7.2. It was mixed for approximately 15 minutes<br>
and was then pumped to a supply tank from which it was<br>
fed to an Inclined Wire type papermachine at a rate of<br>
1135 liters per minute through a 41 cm Black Clawson<br>
Twin Hydra Disc refiner running with a motor load of<br>
100 amps. The total flow to the headbox of the<br>
papermachine was 5,000 liters per minute. This paper<br>
was dried and wound in accordance with normal<br>
papermaking practices.<br>
High pH process of this invention:<br>
To a tank containing 62,610 liters of water, 65.3 kgms<br>
of 0.64 cm long para-aramid floc and 5,260 liters of<br>
dispersion containing 0.544 weight percent of meta-<br>
aramid binder fibrids were added. Sodium hydroxide was<br>
added to adjust the dispersion pH to 11.4. The<br>
dispersion was mixed for approximately 15 minutes and<br>
then pumped to a supply tank from which it was fed to<br>
an Inclined Wire type papermachine at a rate of 1135<br>
liters per minute through a 41 cm Black Clawson Twin<br>
Hydra Disc refiner which was running with a motor load<br>
of 100 amps. The total flow to the headbox was 5,000<br>
liters per minute. All other water supplies on the<br>
papermachine were adjusted to have a pH of 11.4. This<br>
paper was dried and wound in accordance with normal<br>
papermaking practices.<br>
The paper resulting from the process of this<br>
invention was more uniform in appearance than paper<br>
from the control process.<br>
