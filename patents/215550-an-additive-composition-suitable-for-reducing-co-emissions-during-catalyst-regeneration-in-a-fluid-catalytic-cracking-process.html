				<td>CO OXIDATION PROMOTERS<br>
FOR USE IN FCC PROCESSES<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A major industrial problem involves the development of efficient<br>
methods for reducing the concentration of air pollutants, such as carbon<br>
monoxide, sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides in waste gas streams which<br>
result from the processing and combustion of sulfur, carbon and nitrogen<br>
containing fuels. The discharge of these waste gas streams into the<br>
atmosphere is environmentally undesirable at the sulfur oxide, carbon<br>
monoxide and nitrogen oxide concentrations that are frequently<br>
encountered in conventional operations. The regeneration of cracking<br>
catalyst, which has been deactivated by coke deposits in the catalytic<br>
cracking of sulfur and nitrogen containing hydrocarbon feedstocks, is a<br>
typical example of a process which can result in a waste gas stream<br>
containing relatively high levels of carbon monoxide, sulfur and nitrogen<br>
oxides.<br>
Catalytic cracking of heavy petroleum fractions is one of the major<br>
refining operations employed in the conversion of crude petroleum oils to<br>
useful products such as the fuels utilized by internal combustion engines.<br>
In fiuidized catalytic cracking (FCC) processes, high molecular weight<br>
hydrocarbon liquids and vapors are contacted with hot, finely-divided, solid<br>
catalyst particles, either in a fiuidized bed reactor or in an elongated<br>
transfer line reactor, and maintained at an elevated temperature in a<br>
fiuidized or dispersed state for a period of time sufficient to effect the<br>
desired degree of cracking to lower molecular weight hydrocarbons of the<br>
kind typically present in motor gasoline and distillate fuels.<br>
In the catalytic cracking of hydrocarbons, some nonvolatile<br>
carbonaceous material or coke is deposited on the catalyst particles. Coke<br>
comprises highly condensed aromatic hydrocarbons and generally<br>
contains from about 4 to about 10 weight percent hydrogen. When the<br>
hydrocarbon feedstock contains organic sulfur and nitrogen compounds,<br>
the coke also contains sulfur and nitrogen. As coke accumulates on the<br>
cracking catalyst, the activity of the catalyst for cracking and the selectivity<br>
of the catalyst for producing gasoline blending stocks diminishes.<br>
Catalyst which has become substantially deactivated through the deposit<br>
of coke is continuously withdrawn from the reaction zone. This deactivated<br>
catalyst is conveyed to a stripping zone where volatile deposits are<br>
removed with an inert gas at elevated temperatures. The catalyst particles<br>
are then reactivated to essentially their original capabilities by substantial<br>
removal of the coke deposits in a suitable regeneration process.<br>
Regenerated catalyst is then continuously returned to the reaction zone to<br>
repeat the cycle.<br>
Catalyst regeneration is accomplished by burning the coke deposits<br>
from the catalyst surfaces with an oxygen containing gas such as air. The<br>
combustion of these coke deposits can be regarded, in a simplified<br>
manner, as the oxidation of carbon and the products are carbon monoxide<br>
and carbon dioxide.<br>
High residual concentrations of carbon monoxide in flue gases from<br>
regenerators have been a problem since the inception of catalytic cracking<br>
processes. The evolution of FCC has resulted in the use of increasingly<br>
high temperatures in FCC regenerators in order to achieve the required<br>
low carbon levels in the regenerated crystalline aluminosilicate catalysts.<br>
Typically, present day regenerators now operate at temperatures in the<br>
range of about 1100° F. to 1350° F. when no promoter is used and result<br>
in flue gases having a CO2/CO ratio in the range of 1.5 to 0.8. The<br>
oxidation of carbon monoxide is highly exothermic and can result in so-<br>
called "carbon monoxide afterburning" which can take place in the dilute<br>
catalyst phase, in the cyclones or in the flue gas lines. Afterburning has<br>
caused significant damage to plant equipment. On the other hand,<br>
unburned carbon monoxide in atmosphere-vented flue gases represents a<br>
loss of flue value and is ecologically undesirable.<br>
Restrictions on the amount of carbon monoxide, which can be<br>
exhausted into the atmosphere and the process advantages resulting from<br>
more complete oxidation of carbon monoxide, have stimulated several<br>
approaches to the provision of means for achieving complete combustion<br>
of carbon monoxide in the regenerator.<br>
The use of precious metals to catalyze oxidation of carbon<br>
monoxide in the regenerators of FCC units has gained broad commercial<br>
acceptance. Some of the history of this development is set forth in U.S.<br>
Pat. No. 4,171,286 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,222,856. In the earlier stages of<br>
the development, the precious metal was deposited on the particles of<br>
cracking catalyst. Present practice is generally to supply a promoter in the<br>
form of solid fluidizable particles containing a precious metal, such<br>
particles being physically separate from the particles of cracking catalyst.<br>
The precious metal or compound thereof, is supported on particles of<br>
suitable carrier material and the promoter particles are usually introduced<br>
into the regenerator separately from the particles of cracking catalyst. The<br>
particles of promoter are not removed from the system as fines and are<br>
cocirculated with" cracking catalyst particles during the<br>
cracking/stripping/regeneration cycles. Judgement of the CO combustion<br>
efficiency of a promoter is done by measuring the difference in<br>
temperature, delta T, between the (hotter) dilute phase and the dense<br>
phase.<br>
Promoter products used on a commercial basis in FCC units<br>
include calcined spray dried porous microspheres of kaolin clay<br>
impregnated with a small amount (e.g., 100 or 500 ppm) of platinum.<br>
Reference is made to U.S. Pat. No. 4,171,286 (supra). Most commercially<br>
used promoters are obtained by impregnating a source of platinum on<br>
microspheres of high purity porous alumina, typically gamma alumina. The<br>
selection of platinum as the precious metal in various commercial products<br>
appears to reflect a preference for this metal that is consistent with prior<br>
art disclosures that platinum is the most effective group VIII metal for<br>
carbon monoxide oxidation promotion in FCC regenerators. See, for<br>
example, FIG. 3 in U.S. Pat. No. 4,107,032 and the same figure in U.S.<br>
Pat. No. 4,350,614. The figure illustrates the effect of increasing the<br>
concentration of various species of precious metal promoters from 0.5 to<br>
10 ppmon CO2/CO ratio.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 4,608,357 teaches that palladium is unusually<br>
effective in promoting the oxidation of carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide<br>
under conditions such as those that prevail in the regenerators of FCC<br>
units when the palladium is supported on particles of a specific form of<br>
silica-alumina, namely leached mullite. The palladium may be the sole<br>
catalytically active metal component of the promoter or it may be mixed<br>
with other metals such as platinum.<br>
U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,164,072 and 5,110,780, relate to an FCC CO<br>
promoter having Pt on La-stabilized alumina, preferably about 4-8 weight<br>
percent La2 O3. It is disclosed that ceria "must be excluded." At col. 3, it is<br>
disclosed that "In the presence of an adequate amount of La2 O3, say<br>
about 6-8 percent, 2 percent Ce is useless. It is actually harmful if the La2<br>
O3 is less." In an"illustrative example "072 and "780 demonstrates an<br>
adverse effect of 8% Ce on CO promotion of platinum supported on a<br>
gamma alumina and a positive effect of La.<br>
When sulfur and nitrogen containing feedstocks are utilized in<br>
catalytic cracking process, the coke deposited on the catalyst contains<br>
sulfur and nitrogen. During regeneration of coked deactivated catalyst, the<br>
coke is burned from the catalyst surface that then results in the conversion<br>
of sulfur to sulfur oxides and nitrogen to nitrogen oxides.<br>
Unfortunately, the more active combustion promoters such as<br>
platinum and palladium also serve to promote the formation of nitrogen<br>
oxides in the regeneration zone. Since the discharge of nitrogen oxides<br>
into the atmosphere is environmentally undesirable, the use of these<br>
promoters has the effect of substituting one undesirable emission for<br>
another. It has been reported that the use of prior art CO promoters can<br>
cause a dramatic increase (e.g. &gt;300%) in NOX.<br>
Various approaches have been used to either reduce the formation<br>
of noxious gases or treat them after they are formed. Most typically,<br>
additives have been used either as an integral part of the FCC catalyst<br>
particles or as separate particles in admixture with the FCC catalyst.<br>
Various additives have been developed that will carry out CO<br>
promotion while controlling NOx emissions.<br>
U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,350,614, 4,072,600 and 4,088,568 mention rare<br>
earth addition to Pt based CO promoters. An example is 4% REO that<br>
shows some advantage. There is no teaching of any effect of REO on<br>
decreasing NOx emissions from the FCCU.<br>
US 4,199,435 teaches a combustion promoter selected from the Pt,<br>
Pd, Ir, Os, Ru, Rh, Re and copper on an inorganic support.<br>
US 4,290,878 teaches a Pt-lr and Pt-Rh bimetallic promoter that<br>
reduces NOx compared to conventional Pt promoter.<br>
US 4,300,997 patent teaches the use of a Pd-Ru promoter for<br>
oxidation of CO that does not cause excessive NOx formation.<br>
US 4,544,645 describes a bimetallic of Pd with every other Group<br>
VIII metal but Ru.<br>
US 6,165,933 and 6,358,881 describe compositions comprising a<br>
component containing (i) an acidic oxide support, (ii) an alkali metal and/or<br>
alkaline earth metal or mixtures thereof, (iii) a transition metal oxide having<br>
oxygen storage capability, and (iv) palladium; to promote CO combustion<br>
in FCC processes while minimizing the formation of NOx.<br>
US 6,117,813 teaches a CO promoter consisting of a Group VIII<br>
transition metal oxide, Group IIIB transition metal oxide and Group MA<br>
metal oxide.<br>
There is still a need, however, for improved CO oxidation promoters<br>
having NOX emission control in FCC processes.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

oxide support, (ii) ceria (iii) at least one oxide of a lanthanide series<br>
element other than ceria, (iv), optionally, at least one oxide of a transition<br>

separate particles admixed with the FCC catalyst.<br>
These and other aspects of the invention are described in further<br>
detail below.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention encompasses the discovery that certain classes of<br>
compositions are very effective for both the reduction of CO and control of<br>
NOx gas emissions in FCC processes. The CO reduction compositions of<br>
the inventions are characterized in that they comprise (i) an acidic oxide<br>
support, (ii) cerium oxide (iii) at least one oxide of a lanthanide series<br>
element other than ceria, (iv), optionally, at least one oxide of a transition<br>
metal selected from Groups Ib and llb of the Periodic Table and mixtures<br>
thereof and (v) at least one precious metal.<br>
The acidic oxide support should be of sufficient acidity for the<br>
composition to act as an effective additive for CO oxidation promotion and<br>
NOX control. Acidic oxide catalyst supports are well know to those of<br>
ordinary skill in the art and include, for example, transitional aluminas such<br>
as gamma and eta alumina, silica-stabilized versions of said aluminas,<br>
including the silica-stabilized alumina spinel formed by leaching silica from<br>
kaolin calcined through its characteristic exotherm to form the spinel, or<br>
mullite. The support may be crystalline or amorphous. Preferably, the<br>
acidic oxide support contains at least some alumina. More preferably, the<br>
oxide support contains at least 50 wt. % alumina. The oxide support is<br>
preferably an oxide selected from the group consisting of alumina and<br>
silica-alumina. Where an amorphous silica-alumina support is used, the<br>
support preferably has an alumina to silica molar ratio of from about 1:1 up<br>
to about 50:1. Examples of commercially available acidic oxide alumina<br>
supports are available under tradenames such as PURALOX, CATAPAL<br>
and VERSAL. Examples of commercially available acidic silica-alumina<br>
supports are available under the tradenames such as SIRAL and<br>
SIRALOX.<br>
The silica-alumina support can optionally be created by the caustic<br>
leaching of silica from preformed kaolin microspheres as described in US<br>
Patents 4,847,225 and 4,628,042, which are hereby incorporated by<br>
reference for their teachings in this regard. Preferably, the kaolin that is<br>
subject to caustic leaching is calcined substantially through its<br>
characteristic exotherm to form spinel and/or mullite. More preferably, the<br>
caustic leached kaolin support is a microsphere whereby the caustic<br>
leached kaolin is bound with aluminum chlorohydroxide before calcination<br>
through the exotherm.<br>
The acidic oxide support further preferably has sufficient surface<br>
area to facilitate CO oxidation promotion and control. Preferably, the oxide<br>
support has a surface area of at least about 20 m2/g, more preferably from<br>
about 50 up to about 300 m2/g. The acidic oxide support may be a powder<br>
which is preferable when used as an integral part of the FCC catalyst or a<br>
microsphere or particle, preferably when used as an admixture with FCC<br>
catalysts.<br>
The amount of the cerium oxide (ceria) present in the additive<br>
composition of the present invention may be varied considerably relative to<br>
the amount of acidic oxide support. Preferably, the additive composition<br>
contains at least about 0.5 part by weight of cerium oxide per 100 parts by<br>
weight of the acidic oxide support material, more preferably from at least<br>
about 1 part by weight up to about 25 parts by weight of cerium oxide per<br>
100 parts of the acidic oxide support material.<br>
The lanthanide oxides other than ceria include at least one metal<br>
oxide from the lanthanide series other than ceria. Preferably, the<br>
lanthanide oxide other than ceria is praseodymium oxide. The amount of<br>
the lanthanide oxide other than ceria present in the additive composition<br>
may be varied considerably relative to the amount of acidic oxide support.<br>
Preferably, the additive composition contains from at least about 0.05 part<br>
by weight of oxide per 100 parts by weight of the acidic oxide support<br>
material, more preferably from at least about 1 part by weight up to about<br>
25 parts by weight of lanthanide oxide other than ceria mixture per 1 (30<br>
parts of the acidic oxide support material. The amount of ceria to the<br>
lanthanide oxides other than ceria present in the additive composition of<br>
this invention ranges from 1:20 to20:1 by weight, preferably 1:10 to 10:1.<br>
The Group Ib and/or lib transition metals may be any metal or<br>
combination of metals selected from those groups of the Periodic Table.<br>
Preferably, the transition metal is selected from the group consisting of Cu,<br>
Ag, Zn and mixtures thereof. The amount of transition metal present is<br>
preferably at least about 100 parts by weight (measured as metal oxide)<br>
per million parts of the oxide support material, more preferably from about<br>
0.1 up to about 5 parts by weight per 100 parts of the oxide support<br>
material.<br>
The amount of precious metal can be varied considerably<br>
depending the level of CO combustion promotion desired. Typical levels of<br>
precious metal will be in the range of 50 to 1500 ppm of total additive<br>
and/or catalyst. As used herein the precious metals include those<br>
selected from a group consisting of Pt, Pd, Ir, Os, Ru, Rh, Re and their<br>
precursors such as salts and amine complexes and mixtures thereof,<br>
preferably the precious metal is Pt, Pd or mixtures thereof.<br>
The additive composition may contain minor amounts of other<br>
materials, which preferably do not adversely affect the CO oxidation or<br>
NOX control function in a significant way. Reference herein to NOX control<br>
typically refers to the reduction of NOX emissions from the FCC process,<br>
although other types of control are contemplated by this invention<br>
including, for example, the maintenance of the NOX emission levels in the<br>
FCC unit where increased emissions of NOX are expected. The additive<br>
composition may consist essentially of items (i)-(v) mentioned above, item<br>
(iv) being optional. Where the composition of the invention is used as an<br>
additive particle for an FCC process (as opposed to being integrated into<br>
the FCC catalyst particles themselves), the additive composition may be<br>
combined with fillers (e.g. clay, silica-alumina, silica and/or alumina<br>
particles) and/or binders (e.g. silica sol, alumina sol, silica alumina sol,<br>
etc.) to form particles suitable for use in an FCC process, preferably-by<br>
spray drying before the calcination of step. More preferably, porous<br>
particles, also known as microspheres, are formed from acidic oxide<br>
support typically by spray drying powdered oxide support material<br>
combined with a binder/filler before or after impregnation with the<br>
individual constituents. Preferably, any added binders or fillers used do not<br>
significantly adversely affect the performance of the additive component.<br>
Where the additive composition is used as an additive particulate<br>
(as opposed to being integrated into the FCC catalyst particles<br>
themselves), the amount of additive component in the additive particles is<br>
preferably at least 50 wt %, more preferably at least 75 wt. %. Most<br>
preferably, the additive particles consist entirely of the additive component.<br>
The additive particles are preferably of a size suitable for circulation with<br>
the catalyst inventory in an FCC process. The additive particles preferably<br>
have an average particle size of about 20-200 µm. The additive particles<br>
preferably have attrition characteristics such that they can withstand the<br>
severe environment of an FCCU.<br>
As previously mentioned the additive composition of the invention<br>
may be integrated into the FCC catalyst particles themselves. In such<br>
case, any conventional FCC catalyst particle components may be used in<br>
combination with the additive composition of the invention. If integrated<br>
into the FCC catalyst particles the additive composition of the invention<br>
preferably represents at least about 0.02 wt. % the FCC catalyst particle.<br>
While the invention is not limited to any particular method of<br>
manufacture, the additive composition of the invention is preferably made<br>
by the following procedures:<br>
(a) co-impregnate the acidic oxide support particles with a<br>
cerium oxide source, at least one lanthanide oxide source<br>
other than ceria, and, optionally, at least one source of a<br>
Group 1b/llb element.<br>
(b) calcine the impregnated support of step (a)<br>
(c) impregnate the formed material in step (b) with the desired<br>
level and choice of precious metal or precursor salt or<br>
complex,<br>
(d) optionally, recalcine the impregnated additive from step (c).<br>
The sources of oxides are preferably slurries, sols and/or solutions<br>
of the metal oxides themselves or salts of the respective metals, which<br>
decompose to oxides on calcination, or combinations of oxides and salts.<br>
If desired, the individual constituents may be separately added to the<br>
support particles with a calcination step in between each addition. The<br>
calcination steps are preferably performed at about 450-750° C.<br>
The additive composition may be used as a separate additive<br>
particle or as an integral part of an FCC catalyst particle. If used as an<br>
additive, the additive component may itself be formed into particles<br>
suitable for use in a FCC process. Alternatively, the additive component<br>
may be combined with binders, fillers, etc. by any conventional technique.<br>
See for example, the process described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,194,413, the<br>
disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Where the additive component of the invention is integrated into an<br>
FCC catalyst particle, preferably the component is first formed and then<br>
combined with the other constituents which make up the FCC catalyst<br>
particle. Incorporation of the additive composition directly into FCC<br>
catalyst particles may be accomplished by any known technique.<br>
Examples of suitable techniques for this purpose are disclosed in U.S. Pat.<br>
Nos. 3,957,689; 4,499,197; 4,542,188 and 4,458,623, the disclosures of<br>
which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Preferably, the compositions of this invention do not contain alkali<br>
and/or alkaline earth metals. The absence of alkali and/or alkaline earth<br>
metals in the additive compositions of this invention is intended to mean<br>
that they are substantially absent from such compositions so as not to<br>
which preferably do not adversely affect the CO oxidation or NOX control<br>
function of such compositions in a significant way. Typically, the absence<br>
of the amount of alkali and/or alkaline earth metals shall mean less than<br>
about 1%, preferably, less than about 0.5% and, more preferably, less<br>
than about 0.1 % alkali and alkaline earth metal present in the additive<br>
compositions of this invention.<br>
The compositions of the invention may be used in any conventional<br>
FCC process. Typical FCC processes are conducted at reaction<br>
temperatures of 450 to 650° C. with catalyst regeneration temperatures of<br>
600 to 850° C. The compositions of the invention may be used in FCC<br>
processing of any typical hydrocarbon feedstocks. Preferably, the<br>
compositions of the invention are used in FCC processes involving the<br>
cracking of hydrocarbon feedstocks which contain above average amounts<br>
of nitrogen, especially residual feedstocks or feedstocks having a nitrogen<br>
content of at least 0.1 wt. %. The amount of the additive component of the<br>
invention used may vary depending on the specific FCC process.<br>
Preferably, the amount of additive component used (in the circulating<br>
inventory) is about 0.05-15 wt. % based on the weight of the FCC catalyst<br>
in the circulating catalyst inventory. The presence of the compositions of<br>
the invention during the FCC process catalyst regeneration step<br>
dramatically reduces the level of CO emitted during regeneration and<br>
controls NOX emissions as well.<br>
The following examples are illustrative of embodiments of the<br>
invention and are not intended to limit the invention as encompassed by<br>
the claims forming part of the application.<br>

CO Oxidation Testing<br>
The additives tested are deactivated by steaming a 50/50 blend of additive<br>
with FCC catalyst at 1500°F for 4 hours in 100% steam. Chemical markers<br>
are used to ensure that the blend composition is retained after steaming.<br>
CO oxidation testing is done in a fluid bed with a gas stream that has 5%<br>
CO/3% O2/5% CO2/balance N2 at 1100°F. Different CO conversions are<br>
achieved by varying the additive charged to the fluid bed reactor. Activity is<br>
defined as the slope of-ln(1-x) vs. space time where x is the conversion of<br>
CO. Data from the CO oxidation activity testing is shown in Table 1.<br>
Results from Table 1 show that additive compositions from the present<br>
invention having comparable precious metal loadings have better CO<br>
promotion activity than prior art materials.<br>
NOx Reduction<br>
A fixed fluid bed laboratory reactor is used. The additives are deactivated<br>
by steaming at 1500°F for 4 hours in 100% steam. A blend containing 0.2<br>
wt% of the additive with a low metal ECAT is used for testing. Coke is<br>
deposited on the blend by cracking gas oil. The spent catalyst is<br>
regenerated at 1300°F in air. NOx emissions from the resulting flue gas<br>
are determined via chemiluminescence. The NOx emissions are reported<br>
at constant coke. Typical results for NOx reduction are shown in Table 2.<br>
Results from Table 2 show that additive compositions from the present<br>
invention reduce NOx emissions when compared with additives from prior<br>
art.<br>
