				<td>A Set of Circuit Board Connectors And a Method of Mounting a Connector To a Circuit Board<br>
The present invention relates to a set of circuit board connectors used by being mounted on a circuit board and to a method of mounting a connector to a circuit board,<br>
Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2006-4642 discloses a vertical connector provided with a receptacle, into which a mating connector is fittable, a plurality of terminal fittings mounted through the back wall of the receptacle, and mounting portions projecting outwardly from the receptacle and fixed to the circuit board by screws, wherein the terminal fittings are formed straight as a whole and the connector is mounted on a circuit board with an open surface of the receptacle facing vertically.<br>
On the other hand, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2006-73237 discloses a horizontal connector likewise provided with a receptacle, into which a mating connector is fittable, a plurality of terminal fittings mounted through the back wall of the receptacle, and mounting portions projecting outward from the receptacle and fixed to the circuit board by screws, wherein the terminal fittings are bent in L-shape and the connector is mounted on a circuit board with an open surface of the receptacle facing horizontally.<br>
For both the vertical connector and the horizontal connector, the circuit board is formed with connection holes, into which one ends of the terminal fittings are inserted, and fixing holes at positions corresponding to the mounting portions.<br><br>
The present invention was developed in view of the above situation and an object thereof is to make a circuit board more versatile.<br>
This object is solved according to the invention by the features of the independent claims. Preferred embodiments of the invention are subject of the dependent claims.<br>
According to the invention, there is provided a set of circuit board connectors comprising at least two types of connectors, each connector comprising a receptacle, into which a mating connector is at least partly fittable, one or more terminal fittings mounted through a back wall of the receptacle and projecting outwardly from the back wall to be at least partly inserted into one or more connection holes of a circuit board, and one or more mounting portions to be mounted in conformity with fixing holes of the circuit board, wherein:<br>
the at least two types of connectors include:<br>
a first connector to be mounted on the circuit board with a<br>
connecting direction with the mating connector oriented substantially<br>
parallel to the board surface direction of the circuit board, and<br>
a second connector to be mounted on the circuit board with a<br>
connecting direction with the mating connector oriented at an angle<br>
different from 0° or 180°, preferably substantially normal to the board<br>
surface direction of the circuit board, and<br>
parts of the respective terminal fittings to be at least partly inserted into the connection holes and parts of the mounting portions to be mounted with respect to the fixing holes are arranged at the substantially same positions in the first connector and second connector.<br><br>
Accordingly, since the arrangements of the connection holes and the fixing holes of the circuit board are common to the first connector and second connector, one type of the circuit board can be used for two types of the connectors, wherefore it is not necessary to prepare special circuit boards for the respective connectors.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the mounting portions are formed to project outwardly from the receptacle.<br>
Preferably, a multitude of the parts of the respective terminal fittings to be at least partly inserted into the connection holes are arranged in a row direction and/or a column direction to form a terminal group.<br>
Further preferably, the parts of the mounting portions to be mounted with respect to the fixing holes are arranged at least in a pair at the substantially opposite sides of the terminal group in the row direction.<br>
A formation range of the connection holes and the fixing holes of the circuit board can be made smaller in the column direction, wherefore a space in the column direction can be effectively utilized.<br>
Further preferably, the parts of the mounting portions to be mounted with respect to the fixing holes are arranged at positions corresponding to the center of the terminal group in the column direction.<br>
In case a solder connecting operation is performed for the terminal fittings at least partly inserted in the connection holes at one end in the column direction with the mounting portions mounted with respect to the fixing holes, an excessive stress can be prevented from acting on the terminal fittings at least partly inserted in the connection holes located at the other end in the column<br><br>
direction due to the solder connecting operation. Thus, the solder connecting operation can be satisfactorily performed at both ends in the column direction.<br>
Most preferably, the mounting portions of the first connector are arranged at the substantially opposite sides in the row direction with the outwardly projecting parts of the respective terminal fittings from the back wall of the receptacle located therebetween and are formed to at least partly cover the respective terminal fittings at the substantially opposite sides in the row direction.<br>
Since the exposed parts of the respective terminal fittings are covered at the opposite sides in the row direction by the mounting portions, the deformations of the exposed parts due to interference with external matters can be prevented.<br>
According to a further preferred embodiment, the mounting portion has a projecting distance which is set beyond the height of the terminal fitting(s) to be located most closely to the circuit board.<br>
Preferably, the second connector comprises at least one pair of lateral projecting pieces projecting toward the connector board so that one or more exposed parts of the terminal fittings except the leading end portions are arranged to be at least partly protected by the one or more projecting pieces, preferably between the two projecting pieces.<br>
Further preferably, one or more mounting members are at least partly insertable into the fixing holes preferably from a side opposite to the mounting side of the circuit board and the leading ends thereof are engaged with mounting holes of the respective mounting portions.<br><br>
Most preferably, the mounting members comprise one or more tapping screws, wherein the external threads of the tapping screws can bite in or engage the inner surfaces of the respective mounting holes, whereby the receptacle can be fixed by the tapping screws.<br>
According to a further preferred embodiment, there is further provided a circuit board connector selectable from two types of connectors prepared, each connector comprising a receptacle, into which a mating connector is fittable, a plurality of terminal fittings mounted through a back wall of the receptacle and projecting outwardly from the back wall to be inserted into connection holes of a circuit board, and mounting portions to be mounted in conformity with fixing holes of the circuit board, wherein:<br>
the two types of connectors include:<br>
a horizontal connector to be mounted on the circuit board with a<br>
connecting direction with the mating connector oriented parallel to the<br>
board surface direction of the circuit board, and<br>
a vertical connector to be mounted on the circuit board with a<br>
connecting direction with the mating connector oriented normal to the<br>
board surface direction of the circuit board, and<br>
parts of the respective terminal fittings to be inserted into the connection holes and parts of the mounting portions to be mounted with respect to the fixing holes are arranged at the same positions in the horizontal connector and vertical connector.<br>
Accordingly, since the arrangements of the connection holes and the fixing holes of the circuit board are common to the horizontal connector and vertical connector, one type of the circuit board can be used for two types of the<br><br>
connectors, wherefore it is not necessary to prepare special circuit boards for the respective connectors.<br>
Preferably, the mounting portions are formed to project outwardly from the receptacle, and<br>
a multitude of the parts of the respective terminal fittings to be inserted into the connection holes are arranged in a row direction and a column direction to form a terminal group, and<br>
the parts of the mounting portions to be mounted with respect to the fixing hoies are arranged in a pair at the opposite sides of the terminal group in the row direction.<br>
A formation range of the connection holes and the fixing holes of the circuit board can be made smaller in the column direction, wherefore a space in the column direction can be effectively utilized.<br>
Further preferably, the parts of the mounting portions to be mounted with respect to the fixing holes are arranged at positions corresponding to the center of the terminal group in the column direction.<br>
When a solder connecting operation is performed for the terminal fittings inserted in the connection holes at one end in the column direction with the mounting portions mounted with respect to the fixing holes, an excessive stress can be prevented from acting on the terminal fittings inserted in the connection holes located at the other end in the column direction due to the solder connecting operation. Thus, the solder connecting operation can be satisfactorily performed at both ends in the column direction. {0009]<br><br>
The invention according to claim 4 is characterized in that, in the circuit board connector according to claim 2 or 3, the mounting portions of the horizontal connector are arranged at the opposite sides in the row direction with the outwardly projecting parts of the respective terminal fittings from the back wail of the receptacle located therebetween and are fomned to cover the respective terminal fittings at the opposite sides in the row direction.<br>
Since the exposed parts of the respective terminal fittings are covered at the opposite sides in the row direction by the mounting portions, the deformations of the exposed parts due to interference with external matters can be prevented.<br>
According to the invention, there is further provided a method of mounting a connector to a circuit board comprising the following steps:<br>
selecting one connector out of a set of circuit board connectors, in particular according to the invention or a preferred embodiment thereof, comprising at least two types of connectors, each connector comprising a receptacle, into which a mating connector is at least partly fittable, one or more terminal fittings mounted through a back wall of the receptacle and projecting outwardly from the back wall to be at least partly inserted into one or more connection holes of a circuit board, and one or more mounting portions to be mounted in conformity with fixing holes of the circuit board, wherein:<br>

One preferred embodiment of the present invention is described with reference to FIGS. 1 to 9. In this embodiment, two types of connectors (vertical connector 10A, vertical connector 10B) mounted or mountable in or at different postures or positions on a circuit board 90 (such as a printed circuit board) are prepared, and preferably either one of the two connectors 10A, 10B is selectively used depending on the situation.<br>
First of all, the horizontal connector 10A (as a preferred first connector) is described with reference to FIGS. 1 to 5. The horizontal connector 10A is provided with a receptacle 11A and one or more mounting portions 12A made e.g. of synthetic resin, and one or more terminal fittings 30A made of a conductive (preferably metal) plate. The receptacle 11A preferably substantially has a laterally long flat shape, a back wall 13A thereof is formed with one or more fitting holes 14A, through which the one or more respective terminal fittings 30A are pressed or inserted to be mounted and at least one lock projection 15A for holding the horizontal connector 10A connected with a mating connector (unillustrated female connector) is provided on the inner surface of the lateral (preferably upper) wall thereof. One or more, preferably a plurality of fitting holes 14A are substantially aligned in a width direction at one or more stages, preferably at two (upper and lower) stages, and the terminal fitting(s) 30A is/are individually insertable into the respective fitting hole(s) 14A. With the horizontal connector 10A mounted on a circuit board 90, an opening surface OS-A of the receptacle HA is facing in a direction OD-A substantially parallel to the board surface direction BSD of the circuit board 90 (or the<br><br>
direction OD-A substantially lies within a plane of the circuit board 90 on which the horizontal connector 10A is arranged or the direction OD-A is substantially perpendicular to the normal direction of the plane of the circuit board 90), and the mating connector is substantially horizontally at least partly fittable (or fittable along a direction parallel to the board surface direction BSD or to the plane of the circuit board 90) into the receptacle 11A through this open surface from front.<br>
The (preferably each) terminal fitting 30A preferably substantially is a narrow and long tab-shaped terminal bent at an angle different from 0° or 180", preferably substantially substantially at right angles at an intermediate position and preferably substantially L-shaped as a whole. One end portion of each terminal fitting 30A is a horizontal section 31A arranged substantially in parallel with the board surface direction BSD of the circuit board 90 and penetrating through the back wall 13A of the receptacle 11A to at least partly project into the receptacle 11 A, and the other end portion thereof is a vertical or angled section 32 arranged at an angle different from 0° or 180°, preferably substantially at right angles to the board surface direction BSD of the circuit board 90 and to be at least partly inserted into a connection hole 91 formed in the circuit board 90 for connection (particularly by press-fitting, soldering or the like). In the terminal fitting 30A, a distal or bottom end portion of the vertical section 32 to be at least parity inserted into the connection hole 91 of the circuit board 90 is a board connecting portion 35A preferably substantially in the form of a round pin, and the remaining part other than the board connecting portion 35A preferably substantially is in the form of a strip wider than the board connecting portion 35A.<br><br>
One or more, preferably a pair of lateral (left and/or right) mounting portions 12A integrally or unitarily project from the (preferably substantially opposite) side(s) of (preferably the rear end of) the receptacle 11 A. More specifically, the respective mounting portions 12A extend like wings obliquely backward toward the substantially opposite lateral sides from (preferably the rear ends of) the substantially opposite side surfaces of the receptacle 11A in order to avoid interference with exposed parts of the terminal fittings 30A, i.e. are at least partly arranged at the substantially opposite sides of the exposed parts of the terminal fittings 30A as shown in FIG. 3. Each mounting portion 12A preferably substantially is in the form of a block having a flat upper surface (surface substantially opposite to the circuit board 90 whose height is set beyond the height of the single stage (or the closest stage out of a plurality of stages) of fitting holes HA (preferably between the fitting holes 14A at the upper and lower stages). Accordingly, when this horizontal connector 10A is seen sideways, the exposed parts of the terminal fittings 30A mounted in the fitting holes 14A at the closest stage (lower stage) cannot be seen by being concealed by the respective mounting portions 12A (see FIG. 5).<br>
Each mounting portion 12A is formed with a bottomed mount hole 16A substantially vertically extending (or extending at an angle different from 0° or 180°, preferably substantially normal to the board surface direction BSD) and making a (preferably substantially round) opening only in the bottom surface, and this mounting hole 16A is to be substantially aligned to communicate with a fixing hole 92 formed in the circuit board 90 in the mounted state on the circuit board 90. The mounting holes 16A of the respective mounting portions 12A preferably are arranged in at least one pair at the opposite ends in a row<br><br>
Jirection (horizontal direction X shown in FIG. 3) with a terminal group 37A as an array of a plurality of board connecting portions 35A in the row direction X and a column direction (vertical direction Y in FIG. 3) located therebetween. More specifically, the mounting holes 16A preferably are arranged at the opposite sides of the terminal group 37A in the row direction X and on a center line Z passing the center of the terminal group 37A in the column direction Y.<br>
Next, the vertical connector 10B (as a preferred second connector) shown in FIGS. 6 to 8 is described. Similar to the horizontal connector 10A, the vertical connector 10B is provided with a receptacle 11B and one or more mounting portions 12B made e.g. of synthetic resin, and one or more terminal fittings 30B made of a conductive (preferably metal) plate. The receptacle 11B preferably substantially has a laterally long flat shape, and a back wall 13B thereof is formed with one ormore fitting holes 14B, through which the terminal fittings 30B at least partly are pressed or inserted to be mounted. These one or more fitting holes 14B are arranged at the substantially same positions as the one or more fitting holes 14A of the horizontal connector 10A. With the vertical connector 10B mounted on the circuit board 90, an opening surface OS-B of the receptacle 11B is facing in a direction OD-B at an angle different from 0° or 180°, preferably substantially normal to the board surface direction BSD of the circuit board 90, and a mating connector is at least partly fittable in a direction at an angle different from 0° or 180° to the board surface direction BSD, preferably substantially vertically fittable (or at least partly fittable or insertable substantially perpendicularly to the board surface direction BSD) into the receptacle 11B through this open surface from above.<br><br>
The (preferably each) terminal fitting 30B preferably substantially is narrow, long and straight in the vertical direction as a whole, and an upper part thereof at least partly projects into the receptacle 11B, an intermediate part thereof penetrates in a direction substantially normal to the board surface direction BSD (substantially vertically) through the back wall 13B of the receptacle 11B, and a lower part thereof projects downward from the back wall 13B of the receptacle 11B to be exposed. In the terminal fitting 30B, a part to be at least partly inserted into the connection hole 91 of the circuit board 90 is a board connecting portion 35B (preferably substantially in the form of a round pin), and the remaining part other than the board connecting portion 35A is in the form of a strip wider than the board connecting portion 35B. Accordingly, the terminal fitting 30B preferably substantially is linear as a whole.<br>
One or more, preferably at least one pair of lateral (left and/or right) projecting pieces 18 project downward adjacent to (preferably from the substantially opposite sides of) the bottom end of the receptacle 11B, and one or more exposed parts of the terminal fittings 30B except the leading end portions are arranged to be at least partly protected by the one or more projecting pieces 18, preferably between the two projecting pieces 18. One or more, preferably a pair of lateral (left and/or right) mounting portions 12B are formed at the (preferably substantially opposite) side(s) of the bottom end of the receptacle 11B while being integrally or unitarily joined with the (preferably both) respective projecting piece(s) 18. Each mounting portion 12B preferably has a bottomed (preferably substantially cylindrical) shape extending substantially in the projecting direction PD of the corresponding projecting piece 18 and preferably is internally formed with a mounting hole 16B substantially<br><br>
vertically extending and making a (preferably substantially round) opening onry in the bottom surface to be able to communicate with the fixing bole 92 of the circuit board 90.<br>
The mounting holes 16B of the respective mounting portions 12B preferably are arranged in a pair at the opposite ends in a row direction (horizontal direction X shown in FIG. 7) with a terminal group 37B as an array of a plurality of board connecting portions 35B in the row direction X and a column direction (vertical direction Y in FIG. 7) located therebetween. More specifically, the mounting holes 16B are arranged at the substantially opposite sides of the terminal group 37B in the row direction X and on a center line Z passing the center of the terminal group 37A in the column direction Y.<br>
In the horizontal connector 10A and vertical connector 10B, the board connecting portions 35A, 35B of the respective terminal fittings 30A, 30B and the mounting holes 16A, 16B of the respective mounting portions 12A, 12B preferably are identical in shape and/or arranged at the same intervals, so that the shapes and arrangements thereof coincide. Thus, if the board connecting portions 35A, 35B of the terminal fittings 30A, 30B of the horizontal connector 10A and vertical connector 10B and the mounting holes 16A, 16B of the mounting portions 12A, 12B thereof are projected on the board surface of the circuit board 90, projected images substantially match and overlap at the same positions. On the other hand, the shapes and arrangements of the connection holes 91 and fixing holes 92 of the circuit board 90 substantially conform to those of the board connecting portions 35A, 35B of the terminal fittings 30A, 30B and the mounting holes 16A, 16B of the mounting portions 12A, 12B and,<br><br>
hence, conform to both horizontal connector 10A and vertical connector 10B (see FIG. 9).<br>
Next, functions of this embodiment are described.<br>
Upon mounting the circuit board connector on the circuit board 90, either one of the horizontal connector 10A or vertical connector 10B is selected in consideration of whether or not interference with peripheral parts can be avoided, connection sides and/or directions with the respective mating connector(s), dimensional considerations and/or other factors.<br>
In the case of selecting the horizontal connector 10A, the one or more bent or L-shaped terminal fittings 30A are first mounted by being at least partly pressed or inserted into the fitting holes 14A from an insertion side, preferably substantially from behind. Subsequently, upon mounting the horizontal connector 10A on or to the circuit board 90, the board connecting portions 35A of the respective terminal fittings 30A are at least partly inserted or fitted into the connection holes 91 of the circuit board 90 from a mounting side (preferably substantially from above) and the mounting holes 16A of the respective mounting portions 12A are substantially aligned to communicate with the fixing holes 92 of the circuit board 90. Subsequently, as shown in FIG. 2, one or more mounting members (such as tapping screws 80) are inserted into the fixing holes 92 preferably from a side opposite to the mounting side (preferably substantially from the underside) of the circuit board 90 and the leading ends thereof are engaged with (preferably pressed into) the mounting holes 16A of the respective mounting portions 12A. Then, preferably the external threads of the tapping screws 80 bite in or engage the inner surfaces of the respective mounting holes 16A, whereby the receptacle 11A is fixed by the screws 80.<br><br>
Preferably  thereafter,   the   board   connecting   portions  35A  of  the respective terminat fittings 30A are electrically connected with conduction paths (not shown) printed on the circuit board 90 preferably by soldering. It should be understood, however, that the terminal fittings 30A may be alternatively or additionally connected to the conduction paths by means of press-fitting. In this case, if the respective mounting holes 16A are formed at positions displaced toward one end of the terminal groups 37A of the board connecting portions 35A in the column direction Y and the receptacle 11A is fixed at the one side in the column direction Y, the circuit board 90 may be inclined in such a direction that the board connecting portions 35A located at the other end in the column direction Y come out of the corresponding connection holes 91 to cause the action of an excessive stress on the other end of the terminal group 37A in the column direction Y while the board connecting portions 35A located at the one end in the column direction Y are being connected preferably by soldering. However, if the respective mounting holes 16A are located at the positions corresponding to the center (center line Z) of the terminal group 37A of the respective board connecting portions 35A in the column direction Y as in this embodiment, the degree of inclination of the circuit board 90 can be reduced or suppressed even if the circuit board 90 should be inclined in such a direction that the board connecting portions 35A located at the other end in the column direction Y come out of the corresponding connection holes 91 while the board connecting portions 35A located at the one end in the column direction Y are being connected preferably by soldering. Therefore, the action of an excessive stress on the other end of the terminal group 37A in the column direction Y can be prevented.<br><br>
In this way, the horizontal connector 10A is fixed in a proper (preferably substantially horizontal) posture to or on the circuit board 90.<br>
On the other hand, in the case of selecting the vertical connector 10B, the substantially straight terminal fittings 30B are first mounted by being at least partly pressed or inserted into the fitting holes 14B from the mounting side (preferably substantially from above). Subsequently, upon mounting the vertical connector 10B on the circuit board 90, the board connecting portions 35B of the respective terminal fittings 30B are at least partly inserted into the corresponding connection holes 91 of the circuit board 90 and the mounting holes 16B of the respective mounting portions 12B are substantially aligned to communicate with the corresponding fixing holes 92 of the circuit board 90. Thereafter, when the respective mounting portions 12B are fixed by mounting members (preferably by one or more tapping screws 80) at least partly inserted into the mounting holes 16B and the respective board connecting portions 35B are connected with the connection holes 91 (preferably by press-fitting and/or soldering) in the same manner as described above, the vertical connector 10B is fixed in a posture in which the opening surface OS-B of the receptacle 11B is facing in the direction OD-B at an angle different from 0° or 180°, preferably substantially normal to the board surface direction BSD of the circuit board 90 or in a vertical posture to the circuit board 90. Since the respective mounting holes 16B preferably are formed at positions substantially corresponding to the center (center line Z) of the terminal group 37B in the column direction Y, the above effect of satisfactorily performing the (preferably solder) connecting operation at the opposite ends of the terminal group 37B in the column direction Y can be fulfilled.<br><br>
As described above, this embodiment has the following effects.<br>
Since the respective board connecting portions 35A, 35B and the respective mounting holes 16A, 16B preferably are arranged at the substantially same positions in the horizontal connector 10A and vertical connector 10B, the respective connection holes 91 and the respective fixing holes 92 of the circuit board 90 are also arranged at the substantially same positions, wherefore one type of the circuit board 90 can be commonly used for both connectors 10A, 10B. Hence, the versatility of the circuit board 90 can be improved and a cost increase can be suppressed.<br>
Further, since the respective mounting holes 16A, 16B preferably are arranged in at least one pair at the substantially opposite sides of the terminal groups 37A, 37B in the row direction X in both horizontal connector 10A and vertical connector 10B, the formation range of the connection holes 91 and the fixing holes 92 of the circuit board 90 can be made smaller in the column direction Y, wherefore a space in the column direction Y can be effectively utilized.<br>
Furthermore, the one or more mounting portions 12A of the horizontal connector 10A project substantially backward (or in a direction substantially opposite to the opening direction OD-A) from or from close to the rear end(s) of the (preferably substantially opposite) side surface(s) of the receptacle 11A and are arranged to at least partly cover the exposed parts of the respective terminal fittings 30A at the (preferably substantially opposite) side(s) in the row direction X. Such an arrangement can prevent the exposed parts of the respective terminal fittings 30A from being deformed by interference with external matters.<br><br>
Accordingly, to make a circuit board more versatile, there are prepared or provided a horizontal connector 10A to be mounted on a circuit board 90 with a connecting direction OD-A with a mating connector orientated substantially parallel to the board surface direction BSD of a circuit board 90 and a vertical connector 10B to be mounted on the circuit board 90 with a connecting direction OD-B with a mating connector orientated at an angle different from 0° or 180°, preferably substantially normal to the board surface direction BSD of the circuit board 90. In the horizontal connector 10A and vertical connector 10B, parts (board connecting portions 35A, 35B) of terminal fittings 30A, 30B to be at least partly inserted into connection holes 91 and parts (mounting holes 16A, 16B) of mounting portions 12A, 12B to be mounted with respect to fixing holes 92 are arranged at the substantially same positions. Therefore, the circuit board 90 can be commonly used for both horizontal connector 10A and vertical connector 10B. <other embodiments><br>
