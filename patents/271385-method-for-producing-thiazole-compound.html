				<td>METHOD FOR PRODUCING THIAZOLE COMPOUND<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a method for producing a thiazole compound.<br>
Background Art<br>
A thiazole compound represented by the'formula (i;<br>
is useful as an intermediate for producing drugs and agrichemicals (see, for example. Patent Document 1). A known method for producing such a thiazole compound comprises reacting 2-halogeno-allylisothiocyanate with chlorine (see Patent Document 2). A method for producing such a thiazole compound by a reaction of 2-halogeno- allylisothiocyanate with sulfuryl chloride or the like in the presence of aromatic hydrocarbon or a derivative thereof is also known (see Patent Document 3). However, these methods do not necessarily yield satisfactory results A method for producing a thiazole compound of the formula (1) by a reaction of 2-halogeno-allylisothiocyanate with a chlorinating agent is known to generate a large amount of heat. For overcoming such a drawback, a continuous reaction method is proposed (see Patent Document 4, paragraph [0008]). However, the continuous reaction method requires a special reaction device, and thus it is not necessarily convenient.<br>
Patent Document 1: JP-A 3-157308 Patent Document 2: JP-A 4-234864 Patent Document 3: JP-A 2002-255948 Patent Document 4: JP-A 2004-506725<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Problems to be Solved by the Invention<br>
For the industrial-scale implementation of the reaction of 2-halogeno-allylisothiocyanate with sulfuryl chloride that generate a large amount of heat, the inventors of the present invention investigated a method comprising prolonging the time for dropwise addition of sulfuryl chloride in order to facilitate gradual cooling of generated heat, or the like. However, the method had a tendency to produce a reduction in yield, and thus it was not satisfactory. The present invention provides a simple and industrially advantageous method for producing a thiazole compound wherein a reduction in the yield of the thiazole compound is suppressed.<br>
Means for Solving the Problems<br>
The present invention provides a method for producing 2-chloro-5-chloromethylthiazole represented by the formula<br>
(1) :<br>
(1) /<br>
which comprises adding sulfuryl chloride to 2-halogeno- allylisothiocyanate represented by the formula (2):<br>
(2)<br>
wherein Hal represents chlorine or bromine, whereby reacting the sulfuryl chloride with the 2-halogeno- allylisothiocyanate, whereina gas inert to the reaction is being blown into the reaction liquid phase.<br>
Effect of the Invention<br>
According to the present invention, a thiazole compound useful as an intermediate for producing drugs and agrichemicals can be produced by a simple and advantageous method that is suitable for industrial-scale implementation, while a reduction in the yield of the thiazole compound can be suppressed.<br>
Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
In the formula of 2-halogeno-allylisothiocyanate, Hal represents chlorine or bromine. Examples of such 2- halogeno-allylisothiocyanate include 2-chloro- allylisothiocyanate, and 2-bromo-allylisothiocyanate.<br>
The 2-halogeno-allylisothiocyanate is a known compound, and can be produced by a known method. For example, 2- halogeno-allylisothiocyanate can be produced by heating 2,3-dihalogeno-l-propene and thiocyanate represented by the formula (3): M(SCN)n (3)<br>
wherein M represents an alkali metal, an alkali earth metal, or an ammonium salt, and n represents an atomic value of M, in the presence of water (see JP-A 9-136874).<br>
The amount of sulfuryl chloride to be used is usually 0.8 to 2 moles, preferably 1.0 to 1.5 moles, more preferably 1.0 to 1.2 moles per mole of 2-halogeno- allylisothiocyanate.<br>
The reaction is usually performed in a liquid phase by using a solvent that does not interfere with the reaction. Examples of such a solvent include an aromatic hydrocarbon solvent such as benzene, toluene, xylene, mesitylene, tetralin, naphthalene, or phenanthrene; a halogenated hydrocarbon solvent such as dichloromethane, dichloroethane, chloroform, trichloromethane, trichloroethylene, carbon tetrachloride, 1-chlorobutane, chlorobenzene.<br>
dichlorobenzene, o-chlorotoluene, or p-chlorotoluene; an aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent such as petroleum ether, hexane, or cyclohexane; an ether solvent such as dimethyl ether, diethyl ether, dipropyl ether, diisopropyl ether, dibutyl ether, methyl tert-butyl ether, ethylene glycol dimethyl ether, dimethoxydiethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, or dioxane; an ester solvent such as ethyl acetate, methyl acetate, dimethyl carbonate, diethyl carbonate, methyl formate, ethyl formate, ethoxyethyl acetate, or methoxyethyl acetate; a ketone solvent such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isopropyl ketone, or methyl isobutyl ketone; an amide solvent such as N,N- dimethylformamide, N,N-diethylformamide, N,N- dimethylacetamide, N-methylpyrrolidone, or hexamethylphosphoric triamide; a nitrile solvent such as propylnitrile; a sulfoxide solvent such as dimethylsulfoxide; and an aromatic nitro compound solvent such as nitromethane, nitroethane, or nitrobenzene. The solvent may be used as a single solvent or as a mixture of solvents. Preferable solvent is an aromatic hydrocarbon such as toluene from the viewpoints of solvent recovery or the like. The amount of the solvent to be used is usually 0.1 to 20 parts by weight, preferably 0.5 to 5 parts by weight per part by weight of 2-halogeno-allylisothiocyanate.<br>
The reaction of the present invention is performed at<br>
usually -25°C to 70°C, preferably 20°C to 50°C by adding sulfuryl chloride to a reaction liquid phase while blowing an inert gas into the reaction liquid phase. It is preferable that sulfuryl chloride is added in as short a time as possible. However, in the case of industrial scale, sulfuryl chloride is added usually over a period of more than 3 hours. Specifically, for example, in the case where sulfuryl chloride is added dropwise at 40°C into a glass lining reactor of 8 m^, a, large amount of heat is generated (28 kcal/mol is generated for 2-halogeno- allylisothiocyanate) and cooling is performed by using a cooling medium of -20°C, the time required to add sulfuryl chloride into the reactor is about 6 hours. The addition of sulfuryl chloride may be performed intermittently although it is usually performed continuously. The reaction time is usually in a range of more than 3 hours to about 20 hours. The reaction time is preferably 4 hours or more, more preferably from about 6 hours to about 8 hours.<br>
Examples of the inert gas to be blown into a reaction liquid phase include a nitrogen gas, a helium gas, a neon gas, an argon gas, a carbon dioxide gas, and the like. Among them, preferred is a nitrogen gas. The flow rate of the inert gas to be blown is 2L/hr or more for 1 kg (net weight) of 2-halogeno-allylisothiocyanate, and does not particularly have the upper limit insofar as the inert gas<br>
does not interfere with the reaction. The flow rate of the inert gas is preferably in a range of 5 L/hr to 50 L/hr, more preferably in a range of 8 L/hr to 28 L/hr. The inert gas is blown usually into the liquid phase of a reaction liquid, preferably to the bottom of the liquid phase. It is preferable that the blown gas forms fine bubbles. It is preferable that the size of an inlet for blowing is small. The bubbles of the blown gas are finely dispersed by stirring at an increased speed. Therefore, if good stirring is performed, the desired product can be obtained in a good yield regardless of the size of the blowing inlet.<br>
During the reaction, the pressure of a gas phase in a reactor is appropriately adjusted within such a range of pressure that does not hinder the blowing of the gas inert to the reaction. The reaction may be performed under atmospheric pressure, reduced pressure, or increased pressure.<br>
The blowing of the gas inert to the reaction is preferably continued during the addition of sulfuryl chloride. Furthermore, after completion of the addition of sulfuryl chloride, the blowing of the gas inert to the reaction is preferably continued for about 1 hour as an aging period of the reaction.<br>
After completion of the reaction, 2-chloro-5- chloromethylthiazole is isolated and purified by a-known method as described below. As the reaction mixture contains a hydrochloric acid gas in an equimolar amount to that of 2-chloro-5-chloromethylthiazole, , for example, it may be washed with an appropriate amount of alkaline water, to obtain a separated oil layer , and then the solvent may be removed by concentration under reduced pressure.<br>
Alternatively, the reaction mixture is gradually heated under atmospheric pressure or reduced pressure, preferably under reduced pressure after aging of the reaction, to distill off the hydrochloric acid gas and a sulfurous acid gas remaining in the reaction mixture, and then the solvent may be removed by concentration under reduced pressure.<br>
Thus obtained 2-chloro-5-chloromethylthiazole may be further isolated and purified by distillation under reduced pressure or column chromatography.<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention will be described in more detail by reference to Examples which the present invention is not limited to. An internal standard gas chromatography (GC-IS) method was used for analyses.<br>
