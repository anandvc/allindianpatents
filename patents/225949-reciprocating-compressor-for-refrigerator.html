				<td>RECIPROCATING COMPRESSOR FOR REFRIGERATOR<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a reciprocating compressor for<br>
compressing a refrigerant in a refrigerator and, more particularly, to a<br>
reciprocating compressor that is capable of improving a lubricating performance<br>
by improving a lubricant used for a reciprocating compressor.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
As chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), a refrigerant used for a refrigerator, an air-<br>
conditioner or the like, has been known as a source material damaging an ozone<br>
layer of the stratosphere, researches on a substitute refrigerant are being actively<br>
conducted.<br>
The substitute refrigerant for CFC/HCFC is desired to be environment-<br>
friendly as well as to have excellent thermodynamical and chemicophysical<br>
characteristics. That is, the substitute refrigerant should have a high energy<br>
efficiency, a zero ozone layer disintegration index, a low global warming index,<br>
no toxic character and incombustibility.<br>
There are a few refrigerants which have no toxicity and no combustibility<br>
and are not CFC among methane-based and ethane-based halocarbon<br>
compounds: R22, R23, R134a, R123, R124 and R125. Of them, R22, R123 and<br>
R124, which are HCFC, are under regulation, and in case of R23, even though<br>
it is a kind of HFC, its thermodynamical property is not so good as to be utilized<br><br>
as a refrigerant.<br>
HFC pure refrigerants usable as a substitute refrigerant among halocarbon<br>
are very limited. Thus, mixed refrigerants have been studied and developed as<br>
substitute refrigerants by mixing two or three pure materials at a suitable<br>
composition ratio to make up for shortcomings of the pure materials and thus<br>
obtain a good environment index.<br>
R134a, R152a or cyclopropane (RC270) can substitute R12 which has<br>
been widely used for the home-use refrigerators and automobile air-conditioners.<br>
An HFC mixed refrigerant such as R404A and R507 is being taken into account<br>
as a substitute refrigerant of R502 mainly used as a low temperature refrigerant.<br>
Meanwhile, HFC mixed refrigerants including R32 are considered as substitute<br>
refrigerants of R22 used for a heat pump and various air-conditioning devices.<br>
Researches are under way for those substitute refrigerants.<br>
The CFC includes R11 (trichloromonogluoromethane), R12<br>
(dichlorodifluoromethane), R113 and the like, of which R12 largely used as a<br>
refrigerant for a refrigerator is one of regulation-subject materials as being a<br>
source material causing an ozone layer reduction and generating a global<br>
warming effect. Thus, currently, R134a is put to a practical use as a substitute<br>
refrigerant of R12.<br>
As a representative example of HCF, R134a exhibits a zero ozone<br>
depletion potential, incombustibility and physical properties similar to R12, and<br>
is widely used as such.<br>
However, with all those advantages, R134a is hardly combined with<br><br>
refrigerant oil currently used for a refrigerating system of R12 due to its peculiar<br>
chemical and electrical properties. Therefore, a refrigerant oil suitable for the<br>
refrigerant R134a is in need of development. Especially, necessity of a refrigerant<br>
oil usable for a reciprocating compressor for compressing the refrigerant R134a<br>
comes to the front.<br>
As shown in Figure 1, the currently used reciprocating compressor<br>
includes: a hermetic container 6 having a suction pipe 2 for sucking a refrigerant<br>
and a discharge pipe 4 for discharging a compressed refrigerant each as being<br>
connected thereto; a driving unit 8 disposed inside the case 6 and generating a<br>
reciprocal motional force; a compression unit 10 for receiving the reciprocal<br>
motional force from the driving unit 8 and compressing the refrigerant; and a<br>
lubrication unit 12 for lubricating each motional portion of the driving unit 8 and<br>
the compression unit 10.<br>
In the reciprocating compressor, when the driving unit is driven and the<br>
compression unit makes a compression operation on the refrigerant, the<br>
lubrication unit supplies a lubricant stored at the lower portion of the hermetic<br>
container to the motional portion of the compression unit, thereby performing a<br>
lubricating operation. The refrigerant compressed in the compression unit is<br>
R134a.<br>
Since the lubricant used for the reciprocating compressor constructed and<br>
operated as described above is used as a refrigerant oil for the compressor<br>
compressing the refrigerant R134a, its physical and chemical properties should<br>
be in good harmony with the refrigerant R134a.<br><br>
Namely, the lubricant used as the refrigerant oil of the reciprocating<br>
compressor needs to have characteristics that it protects well an oil film even<br>
though the refrigerant is dissolved, that it should be thermally and chemically<br>
stable so as not to react in spite of being in contact with the refrigerant and an<br>
organic material metal at a high temperature or at a low temperature, and that it<br>
has a high level of thermal stability so as not to generate a carbon sludge not to<br>
be oxidized at a high temperature part of the compressor.<br>
In order to satisfy those characteristics, characters of the lubricant, such<br>
as a kinematic viscosity, a pour point, a density, a total acid number, a water<br>
content or the like, work as critical factors.<br>
Therefore, if the lubricant used for the reciprocating compressor<br>
compressing a refrigerant of a refrigerator is not harmonized with the refrigerant<br>
of the refrigerator, the oil would be leaked. Then, oil circulation is deteriorated to<br>
degrade a heat transfer performance of the refrigerator and a lubrication<br>
performance, resulting in thatfrictional portions of each motional part are abraded<br>
and thus each part is damaged.<br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 is a sectional view of a reciprocating compressor for a general<br>
refrigerator.<br>
MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Figure 1 is a sectional view of a general reciprocating compressor.<br>
As shown in Figure 1, a general reciprocating compressor includes a hermetic<br>
container 6 to which a suction pipe 2 for sucking a refrigerant and a discharge pipe 4 for<br>
discharging a compressed refrigerant are connected, a driving unit 8 disposed inside the<br>
case 6 and generating a reciprocal motional force ; a compression unit 10 for receiving<br>
the reciprocal motional force generated from the driving unit 8 and compressing the<br>
refrigerant ; and a lubrication unit 12 for performing a lubricating operation on each<br>
motional portion of the driving unit 8 and the compression unit 10.<br>
The driving unit 8 consists of a stator 17 fixed inside the hermetic container, and<br>
a mover 19 disposed spaced apart from the stator 17 and linearly and reciprocally<br>
moved by an interaction with the stator 17 when power is applied to the stator 17.<br>
The stator 17 includes a cylindrical outer stator 16 fixed by a support frame 14<br>
fixed inside the hermetic container, an inner stator disposed with a certain air<br>
gap with an inner circumferential surface of the outer stator 16, and a winding coil<br><br>
20 wound inside the outer stator 16 to which power is applied from an external<br>
source.<br>
The mover 19 includes a magnet 22 disposed with a certain space<br>
between the outer stator 16 and the inner stator 18 and linearly and reciprocally<br>
moved when power is applied to the winding coil 20, and a magnet holder 24<br>
having magnets mounted at equal intervals at its outer circumferential surface and<br>
being connected to a piston 26 of the compression unit 10.<br>
The compression unit 10 includes a piston 26 connected to the magnet<br>
holder 24 and linearly and reciprocally moved; a cylinder 28 into which the piston<br>
26 is slidably inserted to form a certain compression chamber 36; a suction valve<br>
32 mounted at a refrigerant passage 30 formed at the piston 26 and preventing<br>
a backflow of the refrigerant after being introduced into the compression chamber<br>
36; and a discharge valve 34 mounted at the front side of the cylinder 28 and<br>
performing an opening and closing operation on a compressed refrigerant.<br>
The lubrication unit 12 includes a lubricant 50 filled with a certain amount<br>
at the lower portion of the hermetic container 6; a lubricant pumping unit 40 for<br>
pumping the lubricant 50; and a lubricant supply passage 42 for supplying the<br>
lubricant 50 pumped by the lubricant pumping unit 40 to a frictional portion<br>
between the piston 26 and the cylinder 28.<br>
The operation of the general reciprocating compressor constructed as<br>
described above will now be explained.<br>
When power is applied to the winding coil 20, a flux is formed around the<br>
winding coil 20, forming a closed loop along the outer stator 16 and the inner<br><br>
stator 18. By the interaction of the flux formed between the outer stator 16 and the<br>
inner stator 18 and the flux formed by the magnet 22, the magnet 22 is linearly<br>
moved in an axial direction. When the direction of a current applied to the winding<br>
coil 20 is changed in turn, the magnet 22 is linearly and reciprocally moved as the<br>
direction of the flux of the winding coil 20 is changed.<br>
Then, the motion of the magnet 22 is transferred to the piston 26 by the<br>
magnet holder 24, and accordingly, the piston 26 is linearly and reciprocally<br>
moved inside the cylinder 28, thereby performing a compressing operation on the<br>
refrigerant.<br>
That is, when the piston 26 is retreated, the refrigerant introduced into the<br>
suction pipe 2 is supplied to the compression chamber 36 through the suction<br>
passage 30 formed at the piston 26. Meanwhile, when the piston 26 advances,<br>
the suction passage 30 is closed by the suction valve 32, the refrigerant inside the<br>
compression chamber 36 is compressed, and the compressed refrigerant is<br>
externally discharged through the discharge pipe 4.<br>
During the compressing operation, the lubricant 50 filled in the hermetic<br>
container 6 is pumped according to operation of the lubricant pumping unit 40 and<br>
supplied to the frictional portion between the piston 26 and the cylinder 28 through<br>
the lubricant supply passage 42, for a lubricating operation.<br>
As the refrigerant compressed by the reciprocating compressor constructed<br>
and operated as described above, the HFC refrigerant, hydrogenated carbon<br>
fluoride comprising hydrogen, fluorine and carbon without chlorine, is used which<br>
has a high energy efficiency and a zero ODP (ozone depletion potential), is<br><br>
incombustible, and has a low global warming index, no toxicity and<br>
incombustibility.<br>
Specifically, R32, R143a, R152a and the like are used as the HFC<br>
refrigerant, and HFC134a is preferably used for the current refrigerator as it has<br>
a purity of above 99.9%, a molecular formula CF3CFH2 and a molecular weight<br>
of 102.<br>
As the lubricant of the reciprocating compressor for which the HFC34a<br>
refrigerant is used, an ester-based lubricant, a sort of synthetic fluid, is used as<br>
it has a good compatibility with the refrigerant and satisfies physical and chemical<br>
characteristics.<br>
The density of the ester-based lubricant is preferably 0.93-0.99 g/cm3 at<br>
a temperature of 15Â°C.<br>
Preferably, a total acid number of the ester-based lubricant is adopted by<br>
below 0.01 mgKOH/g.<br>
The total acid number of the lubricant, representing an amount of an acid<br>
component contained in an oil, indicates an amount of potassium hydroxide<br>
required for neutralizing an acid component contained in 1g of sample oil by the<br>
number of mg. Since the lubricant used for the refrigerator should be absolutely<br>
neutral, the total acid number works as a basis for determining a deterioration<br>
level of the refrigerant oil.<br>
A flash point of the ester-based lubricant varies depending on a size and<br>
a type of the reciprocating compressor. Preferably, it is below 240Â°C, and it can<br><br>
be below 165Â°C, below 175Â°C, below 185Â°C and below 200Â°C according to the<br>
type of an adopted compressor.<br>
A kinematic viscosity (cSt) of the ester-based lubricant is preferably<br>
10.0-22.5 mm2/s at a temperature of 40Â°C.<br>
A saturated water amount of the ester-based lubricant is preferably<br>
1500~2000 PPM. The moisture contained in the lubricant should be maintained<br>
by below a suitable level because it causes freezing, sludge generation and<br>
corrosion.<br>
A breakdown voltage of the ester-based lubricant is preferably above<br>
30KV.<br>
As so far described, the reciprocating compressor for a refrigerator of the<br>
present invention has such an advantage that since it uses the ester-based<br>
lubricant, a sort of a synthetic fluid with an excellent compatibility with an ethane<br>
group-based R134a refrigerant compressed by the reciprocating compressor, the<br>
lubricating performance is improved and a life span of the reciprocating<br>
compressor is lengthened.<br>
It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and<br>
variations can be made in the reciprocating compressor for a refrigerator of the<br>
present invention without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. Thus,<br>
it is intended that the present invention cover modifications and variations of this<br>
invention provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and their<br>
