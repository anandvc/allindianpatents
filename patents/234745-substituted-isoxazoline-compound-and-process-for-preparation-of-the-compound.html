	ISOXAZOLINE DERIVATIVES AS P. N LIGANDS<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The invention relates to novel ligands of the phosphanylbenzothiophenyl-dihydroisoxazoline, phosphanyl-dihydrooxazolyl-indole and phosphanyl-dihydrooxazolyl-benzofuran type, to processes for their preparation, to novel precursors and intermediates, to complexes with the said ligands, and to their preparation and their use as catalysts in organic synthesis.<br>
Background to the invention<br>
Mixed donor ligands, especially P,N ligands, form a class of not too strongly binding ligands that contain a combination of hard and soft donor atoms in a molecule and consequently the resulting metal complexes exhibit unique reactivity. The utility of the P,N ligands has been demonstrated in a whole range of asymmetric catalysis reactions, such as asymmetric allylic alkylation, hydrogenation, transfer hydrogenation, hydrosilylation, hydroboration, hydro-formylation, Diels-Alder reaction, Grignard cross-coupling reaction, Heck reaction and conjugate-addition reaction, as well as in copolymerisation, terpolymerisation, catalytic amination and cross-coupling (for references see F.Y. Kwong, K.S. Chan, Organometallics 20, 2570-2578 (2001), and G. Helmchen, A. Pfaltz, Ace. Chem. Res. 33, 336 (2000)).<br>
It has been found that a critical factor for selectivity in enantioselective catalyses with P,N ligands is the "bite angle" P-M-N (coordination angle between M, which is the complexed metal, and the ligand atoms phosphorus and nitrogen). Phosphinoaryloxazoline ligands (PHOX ligands) are known (see G. Helmchen, A. Pfaltz, Ace. Chem. Res. 33, 336 (2000)).<br>
The aim of the present invention is the provision of a new class of ligands which, by virtue of their specific binding angle and the possibility of varying the electron donor properties, enable especially advantageous catalysts to be prepared. A particular objective inter alia is to achieve a higher enantiomeric excess (ee) in the catalysis and to obtain high yields.<br><br><br>
and mixtures thereof, wherein<br>
X is oxygen, sulfur, selenium or NQ, wherein Q is unsubstituted or substituted aryl, or alkyl or substituted alkyl; n is 0, 1,2, 3 or 4;<br>
A1 and A2 are each an organic radical capable of bonding to phosphorus, especially unsubstituted or substituted alkyl, unsubstituted or substituted aryl, unsubstituted or substituted heterocyclyl, unsubstituted or substituted cycloalkyl, or -N(D)2 wherein D2 is alkyl or substituted alkyl; or A1and A2 together with the bonding phosphorus atom form a ring, which may be unsubstituted or substituted;<br>
Y, Y', Y" und Ym are each independently of the other hydrogen or alkyl, substituted alkyl (including aryl-lower alkyl wherein the aryl radical is unsubstituted or substituted, and heterocyclyl-lower alkyl wherein the heterocyclyl radical is unsubstituted or substituted), unsubstituted or substituted aryl, or unsubstituted or substituted heterocyclyl, at least one of the radicals Y, Y Y" or Ym being one of the mentioned radicals with the exception of hydrogen; and<br>
Z, when present, is a substituent, it being possible when a plurality of substituents Z is present for those substituents to be selected independently of one another.<br><br>
The invention relates also to a process for the preparation of compounds of formula I, especially of formula IA or IB, or mixtures thereof.<br>
The invention relates also to complexes of transition metals comprising compounds of formula I, especially of formula IA or IB, or mixtures thereof, as ligands.<br>
A further aspect of the invention relates to the use of complexes of compounds of formula I, especially of formula IA or IB, or mixtures thereof, as catalysts in organic synthesis, and to processes for the preparation of organic compounds in which those catalysts are used.<br>
Complexes with ligands of formula I, especially of formula IA or IB, and also mixtures thereof, can be used for a large number of syntheses. In comparison with other ligands, such as PHOX ligands, they give rise to high yields and, when the pure isomers of formula I, especially of formula IA or IB, are used, also high stereoselectivity, for example a high enantiomeric excess. A further advantage is that by varying X, ligands of formula I, especially of formula IA and/or IB, can additionally be electronically modulated and thus, for example by experimental comparison or computer modelling, the optimum ligand for a specific reaction can be ascertained and used.<br>

Compounds of formula V, especially VA or VB, are known or can be prepared according to processes known per se or are mostly commercially available, such as D- or L-forms of leucinol, valinol, phenylglycinol, isoleucinol, alaninol, phenylalanine!, histidinol, methioninol (all obtainable e.g. from Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland) and also tyrosinol, tryptophanol, lysinol, argininol, or glutaminol or asparaginol, each esterified by lower alkyl at the carboxy group, or serinol, cysteinol and the like.<br>
General reaction conditions:<br>
In all the starting compounds, functional groups that are not to participate in a reaction can, if necessary, be protected by protecting groups. It is characteristic of protecting groups that they are simple to remove (that is to say without undesirable secondary reactions taking place), for example by solvolysis, reduction, photolysis or alternatively under conditions analogous to physiological conditions, for example enzymatically.<br>
The protecting groups can be introduced and removed at any suitable stage. The person skilled in the art will be familiar with the suitable protecting groups and the requirements and possibilities for their introduction and removal at different stages of the reaction.<br>
The protection of functional groups by such protecting groups, protecting groups suitable for the protection, for example, of amino, hydroxy, mercapto, carboxy, amido or guanidino groups, reagents suitable for their introduction, suitable protecting groups and reactions for<br><br>
their removal will be familiar to the person skilled in the art. Examples of suitable protecting groups can be found in standard works, such as J. F. W. McOmie, "Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry", Plenum Press, London and New York 1973, in T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis", Third edition, Wiley, New York 1999, in "The Peptides"; Volume 3 (editors: E. Gross and J. Meienhofer), Academic Press, London and New York 1981, in "Methoden der organischen Chemie", Houben-Weyl, 4th edition, Vol. 15/1, Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart 1974, in H.-D. Jakubke and H. Jescheit, "Aminosauren, Peptide, Proteine", Verlag Chemie, Weinheim, Deerfield Beach, and Basel 1982, and/or in Jochen Lehmann, "Chemie der Kohlenhydrate: Monosaccharide and Derivate", Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart 1974.<br>
Where necessary, the said reactions are carried out in the absence of oxygen, and often also in the absence of carbon dioxide and/or atmospheric moisture, for example under a protective gas, such as argon or nitrogen.<br>
Where possible, the starting compounds and intermediate compounds can also be used in the form of salts, obtained in the form of salts or converted into salts in accordance with customary processes, for example in the case of carboxy compounds into the corresponding metal salts, such as alkali metal salts, e.g. sodium or potassium salts, or alkaline earth metal salts, such as calcium salts, or salts with nitrogen bases, such as ammonium, tri-lower alkyl-ammonium, pyridinium salts or the like. Where salt formation is possible, any reference to any compound should be understood as also including the corresponding salts.<br>
In addition to the solvents already mentioned, it is also possible to use other suitable solvents, where expedient and possible for the reaction in question. Such solvents can be selected, for example, from the following list: water, esters, e.g. lower alkyl-lower alkanoates, such as diethyl acetate, ethers, e.g. aliphatic ethers, such as diethyl ether, or cyclic ethers, such as dioxane or tetrahydrofuran, liquid aromatic hydrocarbons, such as benzene or toluene, alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol or 1- or 2-propanol, nitriles, such as aceto-nitrile, halogenated hydrocarbons, such as dichloromethane, chloroform or ethylene chloride, acid amides, such as dimethylformamide, bases, e.g. heterocyclic nitrogen bases, such as pyridine, carboxylic acids, such as lower alkanecarboxylic acids, e.g. acetic acid, carboxylic acid anhydrides, e.g. lower alkanoic acid anhydrides, e.g. acetic anhydride, cyclic, linear or branched hydrocarbons, such as cyclohexane, hexane or isopentane, or mixtures of such<br><br>
solvents or other solvents, e.g. aqueous solutions. Such solvents and solvent mixtures can also be used in working-up, e.g. by chromatography or partition. Any reference to solvents or eluants hereinabove and hereinbelow should be understood as including also mixtures of such solvents or eluants.<br>
Wherever solvents are mentioned hereinabove and hereinbelow it is also possible, where expedient and possible, for mixtures of two or more of the mentioned solvents to be used. The person skilled in the art will know that for certain reactions such solvents or solvent mixtures must be used in anhydrous (absolute) form and that, if necessary, also the reaction vessels used must have dry surfaces.<br>
