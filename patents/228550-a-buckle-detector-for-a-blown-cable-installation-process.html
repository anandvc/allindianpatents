This invention relates to a process for the production of interferon alpha from genetically engineered yeast.<br><br>
It is known to produce human interferon Alpha from the human blood cells and by recombinant DNA technology <br>
Indian Patent Nos. 163693, 169468 and 149916 describe and claim the processes for the preparation of human leukocyte interferon alpha from human blood cells.<br>
In Indian Patent No. 163693, the human interferon alpha is prepared by centrifugation of human blood for separating leukocytes and thereafter inducing them for biosynthesis of interferon.<br>
In Indian patent No. 169468 the process comprises of the following steps;<br>
Adding NH4CI to blood, separating the leukocytes and suspending them in a medium, and inducing the leukocyte to produce interferon and thereafter purifying the interferon by confrolled pore glass chromatography and fractionation in alcohol.<br>
In Indian Patent No. 149916 the process comprises of multiplying established human cells capable of producing human interferon by transplanting the said cells to a non-human warm blooded animal body or by multiplying those cells with a diffusion chamber by which the nutrient body fluid of the animal is supplied to those cells. These cells are then induced by an interferon inducer to produce human interferon.<br>
The Indian Patents No. 153751 and 162268 describe the processes for producing leukocyte interferon by recombinant DNA technology.<br>
In Indian Patent No. 15375-1 describes a process that comprises producing recombinant DNA molecules coding for interferon sequence and cloning the said sequence to produce a type interferon. In Indian Patent No. 162268, the process comprises submerged cultivation of producer strain Pseudomonas species VG84 carrying a plasmid PVG3 with a inserted gene of human leukocyte interferon alpha-2, in a nutrient medium under<br><br>
aeration in the presence of streptomycin followed by isolation and purification of alpha-2 interferon.<br>
In Indian Patent Nos. 162115 and 150740 a process for purifying human leukocyte interferon has been described. In Indian patent NO. 162115 the purification steps are (1) precipitating the native protein with (NH4)2S04., separating the protein precipitate and dissolving it in a buffer containing dissaggregation agent, followed by gel filtration to get purified human interferon alpha.<br>
In Indian Patent No. 150740 the purification of human interferon alpha - 2 is carried out chromatographically in an octyl bonded silica matrix column followed by a glyceryl bonded silica matrix column and again octyl bonded silica column with different buffer solutions under HPLC conditions.<br>
The drawbacks in producing human interferon alpha from blood are as follow:<br>
•	the   possibility   of contamination   of     blood   by  hitherto unidentified infectious agent cannot be eliminated.<br>
•	the process uses a costly medium and is tedious;<br>
•	low yields<br>
The disadvantages in producing human interferon alpha by recombinant DNA technology using Prokaryotic systems that have been employed hitherto are as follows:<br>
•	improper protein processing leading to incorrect protein folding<br>
•	low specific activity of the protein.<br>
•	Removal of endotoxins which are pyrogenic in humans from the recombinant protein involves additional steps.<br>
•	Consequently yields x&gt;f recombinant IFN a are low.<br><br>
OBJECT<br>
The object of the present invention is to overcome the above drawbacks and produce the recombinant alpha interferon by using a genetically engineered yeast.<br>
To achieve the said objective this invention provides a process for producing human leukocyte interferon alpha which comprises:<br>
•	Cloning human interferon alpha gene into pHIL-D2 plamid and transforming E.coli.<br>
•	Transforming the Pichia pastoris cells with the Not I fragment of pHIL-D2 harboring interferon alpha gene by homologous recombination.<br>
•	Screening the Pichia pastoris clones for interferon alpha expression and confirmation of nucleotide sequence of interferon alpha gene from the selected clone.<br>
•	Growing the said Pichia pastoris clone in a fermentor at 28°C-30°C in a suitable medium under optimal aeration conditions.<br>
•	Downstream processing and purification of interferon alpha from the fermentor culture of Pichia pastoris.<br>
The downstream processing and purification of interferon alpha from the fermentor culture of Pichia pastoris comprises:<br>
•	Washing the cells with sodium phosphate buffer of molarity 25 mM to 100 mM and of pH 6.5 to 8.0.<br>
•	Breaking the cells with glass beads in a bead mill in the presence of ImM PMSF (phenyl methyl sulphonyl flouride) or any other suitable protease inhibitor.<br>
•	Adding protein solnbilising agent like urea or guanidine chloride etc to final concentration of 4-7 M and stirring for 2 to 10 hours, at 200-300 rpm and 4-7°C and centrifogation.<br>
•	Diluting the supernatant of the above step 20 fold with Tris-HCl, (25-100 mM) pH 6.5 to 8.0, followed by   clarification<br><br>
either by centrifugation' or filtration and concentration by ultrafiltration.<br>
•	Diluting the above concentrated sample with citrate buffer (25 mM - 100 mM) pH 4-5 followed by centrifugation / filtration and concentration by ultrafiltration.<br>
•	Adsorbing the above sample on cation-exchange column of SP-Sepharose and elutingthe protein with NaCl.<br>
•	Adjusting the pH of the above eluted fraction to neutral pH and adsorbing it on immuno affinity column containing monoclonal antibodies coupled to any suitable matrix and eluting interferon at low pH.<br>
•	Diafiltering followed by sterile filtering the said eluted interferon.<br>
The invention will now be described with reference to the following flow diagrams and example:<br>
Fig. 1   shows the flow diagram for cloning of human interferon alpha gene in Pichia pastoris.<br>
Fig. 2 shows the downstream processing and purification of human interferon alpha from fermentation onwards.<br>
Example<br>
The human interferon a - gene is amplified by PCR and digested with Eco RI. pHIL-Di plasmid carrying the AOXi Promoter is linearized by digesting with EcoRI. The interferon alpha-gene is ligated into the digested pHIL-Di. E.coli cells are transformed with PHIL-D2 - IFN plasmid. Pichia pastoris is transformed with the Notl digested pHIL-D2-IFN plasmid. This results in the integration of IFN gene into yeast genome by homologous recombination. Recombinants are selected by their ability to grow on minimal medium. Recombinants are screened for intracellular expression of human alpha interferon. These steps are explained with the help of flow diagram 1. Pichia pastoris clone expressing interferon alpha is grown in a fermentor in a minimal medium, pH 5.0, 28-30° C, 500-800 rpm for two days and induced with methanol for 48 hours.<br><br>
The fermentor culture is harvested and the cells are washed with lysis buffer, 25 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.0. The washed cells are broken with glass beads in a dynomill in the presence of 1 mM PMSF. To the broken-cell extracts solid guanidine chloride is added to a final concentration of 7M and stirred at 200-300 rpm for 4-6 hours and centrifuged. The supernatant of the above step is diluted twenty times with a buffer, 25 mM Tris pH 7.5 containing 1-10 |LiM PMSF and clarified by centrifugation or filtration. The clarified extract is concentrated 10 fold by ultrafiltration. The 10 fold concentrated extract is diluted again 10 times with 50 mM citrate buffer pH 4.0 containing 1-10 }xM PMSF. The citrate diluted extract is clarified by centrifugation or filtration and concentrated 10 fold by ultrafiltration. The above concentrated extract is subjected to cation exchange chromatography on SP-Sepharose and eluted with a gradient of NaCl. The pH of the above eluted IFN fraction is adjusted to 7.0 and the fraction loaded on to an immuno-affinity column containing monoclonal antibodies coupled to an affigel 10 matrix. Interferon is eluted with 0.2 M acetic acid. The eluted interferon is diafiltered and sterile filtered.<br>
The steps from fermentation onwards are shown in figure 2.<br>
The above process for the production of interferon alpha from genetically engineered yeast has two major advantages over earlier processes which also use recombinant DNA technology. Firstly P. pastoris can be grown to very high cell densities and the interferon gene can be expressed using the strong alcohol oxidase promotor so that high yields of the recombinant protein can be obtained. Methanol is an inexpensive inducer. Secondly since the IFN gene is stably integrated into the yeast genome by homologous recombination there is naneed to use an antibiotic to maintain the plasmid. Finally, yeast being a eukaryote could provide a more suitable environment for the folding of eukaryotic protein like interferon. Perhaps it is for this reason that the interferon produced by the above process was found to give much higher specific activity than those reported earlier for interferon purified from E. coli.<br>

The following spaeifioation particularly describes and ascertains the nature o£ this invention and the manner<br>
in which it is to be performed t-<br><br>
This invention relates to a process for the production of physiologically-active human interferon alpha genetically engineered yeast, PichiaPastoris.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Interferon, the body's most rapidly produced defense against viruses is a protein secreted by the body cells when they are exposed to viruses, bacteria and different types of injected macromolecules. The secreted interferon then stimulates surrounding cells to produce other proteins, which in turn may regulate viral multiplication, the immune response, cell growth and other cell functions.<br>
There are three classes of human interferon:<br>
(i)      interferon a, which is secreted by leukocytes,<br>
(ii)     interferon P, which is secreted by fibroblasts,<br>
(iii)    interferon y, which is secreted by lymphocytes.<br>
Interferon a and p have been referred to as type I interferon and interferon y has been referred to as type II interferon.<br>
Human interferon a proteins generally contain 165 and 166 aminoacids and have molecular weights ranging from 17,000-20,000 daltons, as determined by SDS-PAGE.<br>
Interferon a has been used for the treatment of various viral and cancer related diseases for example to treat, hepatitis B, C and D viral infections and cancer diseases like hairy cell leukemia, AIDS related Kaposi's sarcoma, chronic myelogenous leukemia and renal cell carcinoma.<br>
It is known to produce human interferon alpha from the human blood cells and by recombinant DNA technology.<br>
Large-scale production and recovery of human leukocyte interferon from peripheral blood leukocytes has been reported by Horowitz et al. However, the process is laborious, tedious and time consuming. The yields are very low. The specific activity of the purified interferon is only 2x10^ lU/mg, much below the WHO recommended specific activity of 2x10  lU/mgi<br><br>
Purification of recombinant human leukocyte interferon with monoclonal antibodies has been reported by Stahelin et. al., 1981. The yields are low and endotoxin removal is not addressed.<br>
Lee Jae Ho et. al, 1989, have reported production of human leukocyte interferon in E.coli by control of growth rate in fed-batch fermentation. The yield however islow(lxlO^IU/L).<br>
Production of recombinant human interferon alpha by E.coli using a computer control cultivation process has been reported by Xiao-Ming Yang et. al., 1992. The expression levels are only 1.26x10^ lU/L.<br>
Tamowski et. al, 1986, reported the large-scale purification of recombinant human leukocyte interferon. The process however, is tedious. It involves multiple concentration steps using ultra-filtration and the yields are very low.<br>
Thatcher and Panayotatos, 1986, reported the purification of recombinant human interferon alpha-2 fi-om E.coli. The expressed interferon is found as insoluble inclusion bodies and is purified by ion-exchange, metal chelate and gel permeation chromatography. Though the expression is of the order of 16-47 mg/L, the final yield is only 10% of the initial.<br>
Secretion of a fiision protein of human interferon alpha and bacterial endoglucanase from Aspergillus nidulans has been reported by Gwynne et. al, 1987. The correct cleavage of the interferon alpha from the fiision protein is a drawback of this process and the yields are very low (1 mg/L).<br>
Regulated high efficiency expression of human interferon alpha has been reported in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by Tiute et. al, 1982. The process involves the expression and secretion of human interferon alpha as a fiision protein. The problems of cleaving the fusion protein and purification are not addressed in this process. The expression is only about 15 mg/L.<br>
Indian Patent Nos. 163693, 169468 and 149916 describe the processes for the preparation of human leukocyte interferon alpha from the human blood cells.<br>
In Indian Patent No. 163693 the human interferon alpha is prepared by centrifiigation of human blood for separating leukocytes and thereafter inducing them for biosynthesis of interferon.<br><br>
/<br><br>
In Indian patent No. 169468 the process comprises of the following steps :<br>
adding NH4CI to blood, separating the leukocytes and suspending them in a medium, and inducing the leukocyte to produce interferon and thereafter purifying the interferon by controlled pore glass chromatography and fractionation in alcohol.<br>
In Indian Patent No. 149916 the process comprises of culturing estabhshed human cells capable of producing human interferon by transplanting the said cells to a non-human warm blooded animal body and multiplying those cells in a diffusion chamber by which the nutrient body fluid of the animal is supplied to those cells. These cells are then induced by an interferon inducer to produce human interferon.<br>
The Indian patents No. 153751 and 162268 describe the processes for producing leukocyte interferon by recombinant DNA technology.<br>
In Indian patent No. 153751 the process comprises of producing recombinant DNA molecules coding for interferon sequence and cloning the said sequence to produce alpha type interferon. In Indian patent No. 162268 the process comprises of submerged cultivation of Pseudomonas species VG84 carrying a plasmid PVG3 with an inserted gene of human leukocyte interferon alpha-2, in a nutrient medium under aeration in the presence of streptomycin followed by isolation and purification of alpha-2 interferon.<br>
In Indian Patent Nos. 162115 and 150740, a process for purifying human leukocyte interferon has been described. In Indian patent No. 162115 the purification involves precipitating the native protein with (NH4)2S04, separating the protein precipitate and dissolving it in a buffer containing disaggregation agent, followed by gel filtration to get purified human interferon alpha.<br>
In Indian patent No. 150740 the purification of human interferon alpha-2 is carried out cliromatographically '\r\ an octyl bonded silica matrix column followed by a glyceryl bonded silica matrix column and again octyl bonded silica column with different buffer solutions under HPLC conditions.<br><br>
The drawbacks of producing a human interferon alpha from natural sources are as follows:<br>
the contamination of the blood by an unidentified infectious agent cannot<br>
be eliminated.<br>
the process uses a costly medium and is tedious.<br>
gives low yields.<br>
The problems in producing human interferon alpha by recombinant DNA based process that have been reported so far are as follows:<br>
protein processing to get the correct protein from the host; in some cases the protein is not correctly processed.<br>
Low specific activity of the protein; the specific activity is less than 2x10^ lU/mg.<br>
Presence of endotoxin; removal of endotoxins is a problem particularly for interferon produced in E coli.<br>
The yields though better than those from natural sources have been low<br>
The object of the present invention is to overcome the above drawbacks and produce the recombinant human interferon alpha by using a genetically engineered yeast.<br><br>

The matrix used is Affigel-10. Interferon alpha is eluted at pH 2-4.<br>
The invention will now be described with reference to the following flow diagrams and the examples:<br>
Fig. 1 shows the flow diagram for cloning of human interferon alpha gene in Pichia pastoris.<br>
Fig. 2 and 3 show the downstream processing and purification of human interferon alpha-2 from fermentation onwards.<br>
EXAMPLE 1:<br>
The human interferon alpha gene is amplified by PCR and digested with EcoRl. pHIL-D2 plasmid carrying the AOXl promoter is linearized by digestmg with EcoRI. The interferon alpha-gene is ligated into the digested pHIL-D2. E. coli cells are transformed with pHIL-D2-IFN plasmid. The E.coli transformants are screened for a recombinant in which IFN alpha gene is in the correct orientation with respect to the AOXl promoter present in pHIL-D2 plasmid. Pichia pastoris is transformed with the Not I digested pHIL-D2-IFN plasmid. This results in the integration of IFN gene into yeast genome by homologous recombination. Recombinants are selected by their ability to grow on minimal medium. Recombinants are screened for intracellular expression of human alpha interferon. These steps are explained with the help of figure 1. Pichia pastoris clone expressing interferon alpha is grown in a fermentor in a minimal medium, pH 5.0, 28-30°C, 500-1200 rpm for 2 days and induced with methanol for 48 hours.<br>
The fermentor culture is harvested and the cells are washed with lysis buffer, 25 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 8.0, 2 mM EDTA. The washed cells are broken with glass beads in a bead mill in the presence of 1 mM PMSF. To the broken cell extract solid guanidine chloride is added to a final concentration of 7 M and stirred at 200-300 rpm for 4-6 hours with or without centrifiigation. The extract of the above step is diluted twenty times with a buffer, 25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5 containing 1-10 \iM PMSF and clarified by centrifiigation or filtrafion. The clarified extract is concentrated 10 fold by ultra filtrafion. The 10 fold concentrated extracted is diluted again 10 times with 50 mM citrate buffer pH 4.0 containing 1 fiM PMSF. The citrate diluted extract is clarified by centrifiigafion or filtrafion and concentrated 10 fold by ultra-filtration. The above concentrated extract is subjected to cation exchange chromatography on SP-sepharose and eluted with a gradient of NaCl.<br><br>
The pH of the above eluted IFN fraction is adjusted to 7.0 and the fraction loaded onto an immuno-affinity column containing monoclonal antibodies coupled to an Affigel-10 matrix. Pure interferon is eluted with 0.2 M acetic acid, 0.15 M NaCl The eluted interferon is diafiltered and sterile filtered,<br>
EXAMPLE II:<br>
The human interferon alpha gene is amplified by PCR and digested with EcoRl. pHIL-D2 plasmid carrying the AOXl promoter is linearized by digesting with EcoRI. The interferon alpha-gene is ligated into the digested pHIL-D2. E. coli cells are transformed with pHIL-D2-IFN plasmid. The E.coli transformants are screened for a recombinant in which IFN alpha gene is in the correct orientation with respect to the AOXl promoter present in pHIL-D2 plasmid. Pichia pastoris is transformed with the Not I digested pHIL-D2-IFN plasmid. This results in the integration of IFN gene into yeast genome by homologous recombination. Recombinants are selected by their ability to grow on minimal medium. Recombinants are screened for intracellular expression of human alpha interferon. These steps are explained with the help of flow diagram 1. Pichia pastoris clone expressing interferon alpha is grown in a fermentor in a minimal medium, pH 5.0, 28-30°C, 500-800 rpm for 2 days and induced with methanol for 48 hours.<br>
The fermentor culture is harvested and the cells are washed with lysis buffer, 25 mM sodium phosphate buffer 2 mM EDTA pH 8.0. The washed cells are broken with glass beads in a bead mill in the presence of 1 mM PMSF. To the broken cell extract solid guanidine chloride is added to a final concentration of 7 M and stirred at 200-300 rpm for 4-6 hours with or without centrifiigation. The extract of the above step is diluted twenty times with a buffer, 25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5 containing 1-10 |j.M PMSF and clarified by centrifiigafion or filtration. The pH of the above clarified extract is brought down to 4 with 1-2 citrate, pH 2-4. The above pH adjusted extract is subjected to cation exchange chromatography on SP-sepharose and eluted with a gradient of NaCl. The pH of the above eluted fraction containing IFN is adjusted to 7.0 and loaded onto an immuno-affinity column containing monoclonal antibodies coupled to an Affigel-10 mafrix. Pure Interferon is eluted with 0.2 M acetic acid 0.15 M NaCl. The eluted interferon is diafiltered and sterile fihered.<br>
The steps from fermentation onwards in examples I &amp; II are shown in figure 2 &amp;3.<br><br>
The above process, for the production of interferon alpha from genetically engineered yeast has several advantages over earlier processes, which also use recombinant DNA technology. Firstly, Pichia pastoris can be grown to very high cell densities and interferon gene can be expressed using the strong alcohol oxidase promoter so that high yields of the recombinant human interferon alpha can be obtained. Methanol is an inexpensive inducer. Secondly, since the interferon gene is stably integrated into the yeast genome by homologous recombination there is no need to use an antibiotic to maintain the plasmid. Thirdly, the purification process employed is simple, efficient and results in high recovery of the expressed protein. Fourthly, the process can be scaled up easily for large-scale purification of human interferon alpha. Finally, yeast being a eukaryote could provide a more suitable environment for the folding of eukaryotic proteins like interferon. Perhaps, it is for this reason that the interferon produced by the above process was found to give much higher specific activity than those reported earher for interferon purified from E. coli.<br><br>
