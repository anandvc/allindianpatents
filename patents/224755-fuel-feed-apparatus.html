				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[Field of the Invention]<br>
This invention relates to a fuel feed apparatus and, more<br>
particularly, it relates to a technology that can be effectively<br>
applied to an in-tank type fuel feed apparatus having a fuel pump<br>
arranged inside a fuel tank.<br>
[Related Art Statement]<br>
Conventionally, so-called in-tank type fuel feed apparatus<br>
having a fuel pump and a strainer arranged inside a fuel tank like<br>
the one disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No.<br>
9-112374 are popularly used for motor bicycles and motor cars . FIG.<br>
10 of the accompanying drawings schematically illustrates a fuel<br>
tank apparatus disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open<br>
No. 9-112374.<br>
Referring to FIG. 10, the apparatus comprises a fuel pump 71,<br>
a fuel filter 72 and a pressure regulator 73 contained in a unit<br>
base 74 that can be divided into upper and lower parts. The unit<br>
base 74 is mounted into a fuel tank 75 by way of an opening 75a thereof<br>
so that consequently the pump 71 and the other components are mounted<br>
into the tank 65. A chamber member 76 constituting a sub-tank is<br>
rigidly secured to the inside of the tank 75. More specifically,<br>
the unit base 74 is arranged in the chamber member 7 6 . Additionally,<br>
a fuel flow path 77 is arranged within the unit base 74. Thus, the<br>
fuel sucked up by the pump 71 is made to flow to the fuel filter<br>
72 and the pressure regulator 73 by way of the path 77 and then fed<br>
to the engine by way of a connection pipe 78.<br>
However, while a fuel feed apparatus as illustrated in FIG.<br>
10 shows an improved operational efficiency because the pump 71 and<br>
certain other components are provided as modules, those modules are<br>
rather bulky and particularly the overall configuration of the<br>
apparatus including the sub-tank consisting of the chamber member<br>
76 is remarkably large. Such a large apparatus inevitably requires<br>
the use of a large fuel tank. Therefore, there is a strong demand<br>
for small and lightweight fuel feed apparatus.<br>
Meanwhile, in in-tank type apparatus, one or more than one<br>
filter members such as paper filters and/or synthetic resin filters<br>
are contained in the strainer in order to filter the fuel discharged<br>
from the fuel pump. However, the fuel passing through the filter<br>
can easily generate static electricity due to its friction with the<br>
filter materials. Additionally, the fuel can give rise to turbulence<br>
before and after passing through the filter to cause friction between<br>
the synthetic resin case and fuel, which also consequently generates<br>
static electricity.<br>
Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 8-232792 proposes<br>
an in-tank type fuel pump apparatus wherein cfrounding lead wires<br>
are connected to the fuel filter to allow the generated static<br>
electricity to flow to the ground. A lead wire is connected to each<br>
of the components housed in the tank. Then, the lead wires are<br>
electrically connected with the vehicle wire harness so that the<br>
components are grounded and prevented from becoming electrically<br>
charged.<br>
Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 10-220315 proposes<br>
the use of a filter case made of an electrically conductive material<br>
so that the generated static electricity may be discharged into the<br>
fuel in it from the outer peripheral surface thereof. The above<br>
identified patent document also discloses a technique of connecting<br>
lead wires to the electrically conductive filter case at an end and<br>
to a grounding electrode outside of the fuel tank at the other end<br>
in order to allow the static electricity generated in the filter<br>
case to flow to the ground. If the fuel tank is made of metal, the<br>
lead wires are also connected to it so that the static electricity<br>
generated there may directly flow to the ground.<br>
Meanwhile, fuel tanks are generally provided with a warning<br>
sensor comprising a thermistor for notifying the driver with the<br>
volume of fuel left in the fuel tank when the fuel in the tank falls<br>
below a certain threshold level. Generally, electricity flows<br>
through such a thermistor at a very low rate and hence the thermistor<br>
generates heat to a small extent. When the fuel tank is full of fuel<br>
and the thermistor is dipping in the fuel, the fuel cools the<br>
thermistor and hence its temperature would not rise. If, on the other<br>
hand, the fuel level falls to make the thermistor emerge from the<br>
fuel, the fuel no longer cools it and its temperature rises.<br>
The electric resistance of a thermistor changes as its<br>
temperature. Therefore, the volume of fuel left in the tank can be<br>
detected by detecting the change in the electric resistance of the<br>
thermistor. Thus, thermistors are popularly used as the above<br>
described sensors. Then, lead wires connected to the thermistor are<br>
also arranged in the fuel tank so that the signal from the thermistor<br>
is received by way of the lead wires to detect the volume of fuel<br>
left in the tank.<br>
However, many other wires are already found in the fuel pump<br>
including those for preventing the strainer from being<br>
electrically charged and those for feeding the motor with<br>
electricity. Therefore,as wires are laid for the<br>
thermistor, the number of wires in the fuel tank will be<br>
enormous if the wires on the negative side are put together.<br>
This means that the provision of a thermistor entails an<br>
increase in the workload of wiring operations, in the<br>
number of parts and in the manufacturing cost.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to<br>
provide a small and compact fuel feed apparatus that<br>
occupies less space than conventional apparatus of the type<br>
under consideration.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a fuel<br>
feed apparatus that can be realized in a simplified manner<br>
by reducing the number of wiring steps of operation and<br>
also the number of parts of the apparatus.<br>
According to the invention, the above objects are<br>
achieved by providing a fuel feed apparatus comprising :<br>
a fuel pump for sucking fuel from a fuel tank and<br>
discharging it ; a strainer for filtering the fuel<br>
discharged from said fuel pump ; a pressure regulator for<br>
regulating the fuel feeding pressure ; said fuel pump and<br>
at least either said strainer or said pressure regulator<br>
being arranged within said fuel tank. ; a sleeve-like<br>
reservoir arranged in said fuel tank and having an internal<br>
space for storing the fuel which said fuel pump sucks in ;<br>
a holder fitted to an upper portion of said sleeve-like<br>
reservoir and holding said fuel pump and at least either<br>
said strainer or said pressure regulator ; and a coupling<br>
member fitted to an upper portion of said fuel pump and<br>
also to an upper portion of at least said strainer or said<br>
pressure regulator and having therein a fuel flow path for<br>
connecting said fuel pump and at least either said strainer<br>
or said pressure regulator ;<br>
said fuel feed apparatus being characterized by also<br>
comprising : a sensor for detecting the amount of the<br>
residual fuel in the fuel tank ; and a sensor holder made<br>
of an electrically conductive material and arranged in<br>
said fuel tank to hold said-sensor ; said sensor holder<br>
having a strainer-connecting section connected to said<br>
strainer and an earth-connecting section electrically<br>
connected to the grounding terminal of said sensor.<br>
Thus, with a fuel feed apparatus according to the<br>
invention, the fuel pump and the strainer or the pressure<br>
regulator can be linked together simply by arranging a<br>
coupling member between them and to streamline the<br>
apparatus by reducing the size and weight thereof<br>
particularly in an upper area of the apparatus. For the<br>
purpose of the present invention, the sleeve-like reservoir<br>
may be cylindrical or column-shaped. The internal and<br>
external dimensions of the reservoir are not subjected to<br>
particular limitations. Thus, the reservoir may have a<br>
rectangularly parallelepipedic profile or an oval profile.<br>
Said coupling member of a fuel feed apparatus according<br>
to the invention may contain therein a fuel flow path for<br>
connecting said fuel pump with said strainer or said<br>
pressure regulator and said fuel flow path may be provided<br>
with a check valve for preventing fuel from flowing<br>
reversely. With such an arrangement, the coupling<br>
member not only operates to couple the related components but also<br>
provides a room for housing the check valve so that the internal<br>
space of the apparatus will be effectively and efficiently utilized<br>
to reduce the overall height of the apparatus.<br>
Said coupling member of a fuel feed apparatus according to<br>
the invention may include a connecting section of said coupling<br>
member to be connected with said fuel pump is provided with an engaging<br>
section to be engaged with an upper portion of said fuel pump. With<br>
such an arrangement, the space requirement of the connecting section<br>
can be reduced and it is possible to connect the fuel pump to said<br>
coupling member in small space. Accordingly, it can further reduce<br>
the overall height of the apparatus.<br>
Additionally, the fuel returned from the pressure regulator<br>
may be fed back into the reservoir, then, all the fuel returned by<br>
the pressure regulator is put back into the reservoir so that all<br>
the fuel in the reservoir can be used without wasting and the engine<br>
can be fed with fuel on a highly stable basis. Still additionally,<br>
said reservoir may comprise a fuel in-take port having a labyrinth<br>
structure, with this arrangement, the fuel that has flown into the<br>
reservoir would not flow out easily as the labyrinth blocks any fuel<br>
trying to flow out.<br>
In still another aspect of the invention, there is also<br>
provided a fuel feed apparatus comprising a fuel pump for sucking<br>
fuel from a fuel tank and discharging it, a strainer for filtering<br>
the fuel discharged from said fuel pump, said fuel pump and said<br>
strainer being arranged within said fuel tank, a sensor for detecting<br>
the amount of the residual fuel in the fuel tank and a sensor holder<br>
made of an electrically conductive material and arranged in said<br>
fuel tank to hold said sensor, said sensor holder having a<br>
strainer-connecting section connected to said strainer and<br>
an earth-connecting section electrically connected to the<br>
grounding terminal of said sensor.<br>
With a fuel feed apparatus according to the invention<br>
and having a configuration as described above, the sensor<br>
holder can be commonly used as the grounding terminal of<br>
the strainer and also as that of the sensor to eliminate<br>
not only the grounding wire of the strainer but also the<br>
step of arranging the grounding wire of either the strainer<br>
or the sensor. Thus, both the number of parts and that of<br>
processing steps can be reduced in the process of building<br>
the apparatus.<br>
A thermistor may be used for said sensor, additionally,<br>
said sensor holder may be formed by using a metal wire<br>
having said strainer-connecting section formed at an end<br>
thereof and said earth-connecting section formed at the<br>
opposite end thereof.<br>
The above-described and other objects, and novel<br>
feature of the present invention will become apparent more<br>
fully from the description of the following specification<br>
in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Now, the present invention will be described by referring to<br>
the accompanying drawings that illustrate a preferred embodiment<br>
of the invention. FIG. 1 is a schematic lateral view of an embodiment<br>
of fuel feed apparatus according to the invention and arranged in<br>
position. FIG. 2 is a partially exploded schematic perspective view<br>
of the embodiment of fuel feed apparatus according to the invention.<br>
FIG. 3 is a schematic lateral view of the embodiment of fuel feed<br>
apparatus according to the invention, illustrated partly in cross<br>
section. FIG. 4 is a schematic plan view of the embodiment of fuel<br>
feed apparatus according to the invention.<br>
The fuel feed apparatus 1 of this embodiment (hereinafter<br>
referred to simply as "apparatus") is adapted to operate as in-<br>
tank type gasoline feed apparatus to be used with a motor bicycle.<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, the apparatus 1 is fitted to an opening 3 formed<br>
through the bottom 2a of a fuel tank 2 from below. As shown in FIGS.<br>
2 and 3, it comprises a cup-shaped unit base 4 containing a fuel<br>
pump 5, a strainer 6 and a pressure regulator 7 along with other<br>
components to realize in the form of a module. The apparatus 1<br>
purifies fuel 42, sucked up by the pump 5, by means of the strainer<br>
6 and regulate the pressure of the fuel to a predetermined level<br>
by means of the pressure regulator 7 before feeding it to the engine<br>
by way of a fuel feed pipe 43.<br>
A flange 4a is formed as bottom plate at the bottom of unit<br>
base 4. The flange 4a is formed integrally with reservoir 4b<br>
operating as lateral wall from synthetic resin by molding. The<br>
apparatus 1 is oil-tightly secured to the tank 2 as it is fitted<br>
to the opening 3 by way of a packing 8 . Thus, the fuel feed apparatus<br>
1 according to the invention is a module that can be installed by<br>
simply fitting it to the tank 2 and hence can remarkably improve<br>
the efficiency of mounting operation.<br>
The inside of the unit base 4 of the apparatus 1 is empty and<br>
adapted to contain the pump 5 and other components and operate, at<br>
the same time, as a sub-tank 16. In other words, the unit base 4<br>
functions as reservoir so that the fuel 42 sucked up by the pump<br>
5 is temporarily stored in the unit base 4 in order to avoid any<br>
improper supply of fuel that can arise when the motor vehicle drives<br>
up a slope or is fiercely shaken. While conventional sub-tanks<br>
comprise a plurality of components typically as shown in FIG. 10,<br>
that of apparatus 1 of the present invention comprises only a unit<br>
base 4. Thus, the apparatus 1 has a reduced number of components<br>
to consequently reduce the manufacturing cost thereof.<br>
As seen from FIGS. 2 and 3, a holder 9 is fitted to an upper<br>
portion of the reservoir 4b and operates as closure for sub-tank<br>
16. The pump 5 and strainer 6 are held by the holder 9 and housed<br>
in the unit base 4. Meanwhile, a fuel suction port 10 is arranged<br>
under the pump 5 to draw fuel 42 from the bottom of the sub-tank<br>
16. The port 10 is provided with a filter 13 to make fuel 42 get<br>
rid of coarse pieces of dirt.<br>
The pump 5 and the strainer 6 are linked by a coupling cover<br>
(coupling member) 11 that contains a check valve 20 therein. FIG.<br>
5 shows the configuration of the cover 11 and it is taken along line<br>
A-A in FIG. 4. As seen from FIG. 5, the valve 20 contained in the<br>
cover 11 is mounted in a fuel flow path 21 and operates to prevent<br>
fuel from flowing reversely from the strainer 6 to the pump 5. The<br>
valve body 20a of the valve 20 is urged toward small diameter portion<br>
21a of the path 20 by spring 20b. Thus, fuel is allowed to flow from<br>
the pump as the spring 2 0b is compressed under the fuel discharging<br>
effect of the fuel pump 5, whereas fuel is prevented from flowing<br>
from the strainer 6 by the valve body 2 0a.<br>
The pump 5 and the strainer 6 are held in position by the holder<br>
9 and linked together by the cover 11 at an upper portion thereof.<br>
Thus, the pump 5 and the strainer 6 are linked together simply by<br>
arranging the cover 11 at an upper portion thereof in the apparatus<br>
1. The cover 11 can be used to streamline the profile of the apparatus<br>
1 in order to reduce both the size and the weight of the apparatus<br>
1 particularly at the opposite lateral sides thereof. Thus, the<br>
cover 11 provides free space along its opposite lateral sides if<br>
compared with an apparatus of the same type that is covered by a<br>
cup-shaped cover.<br>
It will be appreciated that the cover 11 provides a space for<br>
installing the check valve 20 while it is operating as a coupling<br>
member. Therefore, the cover 11 not only cuts unnecessary space to<br>
reduce both the size and the weight of the apparatus 1 but also<br>
eliminates the space that may otherwise be required for the check<br>
valve to reduce the height of the apparatus.<br>
Additionally, the connecting section for connecting the pump<br>
5 and the cover 11 of the apparatus is designed to be space saving.<br>
More specifically, the pump 5 is provided at an upper portion thereof<br>
with a recess 22 for connecting itself to the cover 11. On the other<br>
hand, the connecting section of the cover 11 for connecting itself<br>
to the pump 5 is provided with a projection (engaging section) 23<br>
to be engaged with the recess 22. Thus, the pump 5 and the cover<br>
11 are linked together as the recess 22 and the projection 23 are<br>
held in mesh with each other. With this arrangement, the connecting<br>
section for connecting the pump 5 and the cover 11 is highly space<br>
saving to consequently reduce the height of the apparatus. It may<br>
be appreciated that alternatively the pump 5 may be provided with<br>
a projection while the cover 11 may be provided with a recess for<br>
connecting them.<br>
Meanwhile, the strainer 6 is provided at a lower portion<br>
thereof with a joint 12, which joint 12 is connected to a pressure<br>
regulator 7. FIG. 6 is a schematic cross sectional partial view of<br>
the configuration of the pressure regulator fitting section. As<br>
shown in FIG. 6, the joint 12 is arranged between a lower portion<br>
of the strainer 6 and discharge port 14 projecting from the bottom<br>
of the unit base 4 . The pressure regulator 7 is connected to a central<br>
portion of the joint 12. Thus, the fuel fed from the pump 5 is<br>
regulated for pressure by the pressure regulator 7 and then forwarded<br>
to the engine so that any excessive fuel is returned to the fuel<br>
tank 2 by the pressure regulator 7.<br>
On the other hand, the apparatus 1 is used in a fuel feed system<br>
that may be a so-called return-less system, the pressure regulator<br>
7 is provided at the side of the fuel feed apparatus. The pressure<br>
regulator 7 is arranged within the sub-tank 16, and all the fuel<br>
returned from the pressure regulator 7 is fed back to the sub-tank<br>
16. Thus, the fuel feed apparatus 1 of the present invention is free<br>
from the drawback of the above described known apparatus of returning<br>
the fuel 42 in the sub-tank 16 to the outside of the sub-tank 16<br>
so that it can feed fuel to the engine on a highly stable basis.<br>
The discharge port 14 connected to a lower portion of the joint<br>
12 communicates with a fuel feed port 15 arranged at the bottom of<br>
the unit base 4. Thus, the fuel sucked by the pump 5 is fed to the<br>
fuel feed port 15 by way of the cover 11, the strainer 6, the joint<br>
12 and the discharge port 15 and then fed further to the engine by<br>
way of the fuel pipe 43. The flow rate of fuel fed to the pipe 43<br>
is regulated for pressure by the pressure regulator 7 and any<br>
excessive fuel is returned to the sub-tank 16.<br>
As seen from FIG. 7, the reservoir 4b is provided at the lateral<br>
side thereof with a fuel in-take port 17 for introducing fuel into<br>
the sub-tank 16. FIG. 7 is a schematic lateral view of the apparatus<br>
1 and FIG. 8 is a schematic plan view where the holder 9 and the<br>
cover 11 are removed from the apparatus 1. A motor bicycle may<br>
frequently be required to stand on the rear wheel and/or tilt sideways<br>
and supported by its prop stand while being fueled. Additionally,<br>
the center of gravity of a motor bicycle moves to the rear wheel<br>
side and it may prance on the rear wheel when accelerated. Still<br>
additionally, the front wheel side of a motor bicycle is higher than<br>
the rear side when it goes up a slope. Under any of these conditions,<br>
the engine requires to consume more fuel than ever. By taking these<br>
circumstances into consideration, the port 17 of the apparatus 1<br>
is arranged at a position that does not allow fuel to flow out when<br>
the body of the motor bicycle is tilted or at a position where the<br>
port 17 will face upward when the body of the motor bicycle is tilted.<br>
With this arrangement, fuel is prevented from flowing out of the<br>
sub-tank 16 even when the motor bicycle stands up on the rear wheel<br>
or when it prances.<br>
The front of the body of the motor bicycle will face upward<br>
when it stands up on the rear wheel, whereas the side opposite to<br>
that of the prop stand of a motor bicycle will face upward when the<br>
motor bicycle is held standstill and supported by the prop stand.<br>
Thus, the opening 17a of the port 17 of this apparatus 1 is arranged<br>
at a position close to the front end of the body and opposite to<br>
the side where the prop stand is provided so that it may face upward<br>
when the front of the motor bicycle faces upward and hence fuel may<br>
be prevented from flowing out under any of the above identified<br>
conditions. Thus, fuel is prevented from flowing out of the sub-tank<br>
16 by way of the port 17 even when the motor bicycle is made to stand<br>
on the rear wheel or tilted on its prop stand so that the aim of<br>
installing the sub-tank 16 may not be devastated and the engine may<br>
be fed with fuel stably and reliably for a long period of time.<br>
While the location of the fuel port 17 is selected by taking<br>
both the situation where the motor bicycle is made to stand on the<br>
rear wheel and the situation where the motor bicycle is made to rest<br>
on its prop stand, it may alternatively be selected by dominantly<br>
taking either of the situations into consideration. If the situation<br>
where the motor bicycle is made to stand on the rear wheel is<br>
considered to be the dominant factor, the port 17 will be arranged<br>
at a position close to the front of the motor bicycle. If, on the<br>
other hand, the situation where the motor bicycle is tilted and made<br>
to rest on its prop stand is considered to be the dominant factor,<br>
the port 17 will be arranged at a position opposite to the side of<br>
the prop stand.<br>
The inside of the fuel intake port 17 has a labyrinth structure.<br>
More specifically, as shown in FIGS. 7 and 8, the port 17 is provided<br>
with a partition wall 18 extending peripherally from the opening<br>
17a to the inside of the unit base 4 to produce a labyrinth 19. The<br>
wall 18 and the inner wall of the flange 4 define a labyrinth 19.<br>
Due to the provision of the labyrinth 19, the fuel flowing into the<br>
sub-tank 16 would not easily flow out from the tank. Therefore, the<br>
selected position of the port 17 and the provision of the labyrinth<br>
19 minimize the risk of allowing fuel to flow out of the sub-tank<br>
16.<br>
Meanwhile, a thermistor 24 whose electrical resistance varies<br>
as a function of the ambient temperature is arranged inside the unit<br>
base 4 as warning sensor for notifying the driver with the volume<br>
of fuel left in the fuel tank. Generally, the internal temperature<br>
of a fuel tank rises as the amount of fuel stored in it decreases.<br>
Therefore, the thermistor 24 detects the volume of fuel left inside<br>
the tank by detecting the change in the ambient temperature and,<br>
when the fuel 42 in the fuel tank goes under a certain threshold<br>
level, it produces a warning by notifying the driver with the fact<br>
that fuel is running out.<br>
FIG. 9 is a schematic lateral view illustrating how the<br>
thermistor 24 is fitted and wired. As shown in FIG. 9, a negative<br>
(grounding) lead wire 25a of the thermistor 24 is branched from a<br>
negative lead wire 25b of the pump 5. Additionally, as seen from<br>
FIGS. 2 and 9, the thermistor 24 is secured to the unit base 4 by<br>
means of a thermistor arm (sensor holder) 26 made of an electrically<br>
conductive material such as a metal wire. A grounding wire<br>
connecting section 26a is formed on the arm 2 6 at a position close<br>
to the thermistor 24 and held in electric communication with the<br>
wire 25a. Thus, the arm 26 is connected to the wire 25b by way of<br>
the section 26a and the wire 25a.<br>
On the other hand, a strainer connecting isection 26b is formed<br>
on the arm 2 6 at the side thereof opposite to the section 26a so<br>
that the arm 26 is held in contact with the outer periphery of the<br>
strainer 6 by means of the section 26b. Therefore, the strainer 26<br>
is connected to the wire 25b by way of the arm 26 and hence grounded<br>
through the arm 26.<br>
Meanwhile, the outer peripheral wall of the strainer 6 is made<br>
of metal or an electrically conductive resin material in order to<br>
allow any static electricity generated by the fuel passing through<br>
the filter member arranged inside and made of paper or resin to be<br>
discharged therefrom. Thus, the static electricity generated in the<br>
strainer 6 flows to the wire 25b by way of the arm 26 and the wire<br>
25a. With this arrangement of the apparatus 1, therefore, the arm<br>
26 is utilized as grounding wire of the strainer 6 so that the<br>
thermistor 24 and the strainer 6 share a common grounding wire. In<br>
other words, the grounding wire of the strainer 6 which is otherwise<br>
need is omitted and hence only a single wiring operation is required<br>
for grounding the thermistor 24 and the strainer 6 to consequently<br>
reduce the number of parts and also the number of manufacturing steps .<br>
It will be appreciated that the above described arrangement<br>
can be used not only for a thermistor but also for a sensor that<br>
may alternatively be installed in the fuel tank with necessary wires ..<br>
If such is the case, the holder of the sensor will be made of an<br>
electrically conductive material and grounded while it is held in<br>
contact with the strainer 6 in order to discharge static electricity<br>
by way of the holder.<br>
Detailed description has hereinabove been given of the<br>
invention achieved by the present inventor with reference to the<br>
embodiments. However, the present invention should not be limited<br>
to the embodiments described above and may be variously modified<br>
within the scope not departing from the gist.<br>
While the pump 5 and the strainer 6 are mounted to the holder<br>
9 in the above embodiment, it may alternatively be so arranged that<br>
the pressure regulator 7 is arranged upstream relative to the<br>
strainer 6 and the joint 12 is mounted onto the holder 9. Then, the<br>
holder holds the pump 5 and the pressure regulator 7 (joint 12) 9<br>
and the cover 11. If such is the case, the strainer 6 should not<br>
necessarily be arranged within the fuel tank 2 as in the case of<br>
the pressure regulator 7 of the above embodiment.<br>
Additionally, while the check valve 2 0 is contained in the<br>
cover 11 of the above described apparatus 1, it may alternatively<br>
be arranged downstream relative to the strainer 6. Then, the<br>
strainer 6 may be provided with a gas release hole.<br>
Still additionally, while the apparatus 1 is fitted to the<br>
bottom side of the fuel tank 2 in the above description, it may be<br>
fitted to the top side of the fuel tank 2 like the known apparatus<br>
shown in FIG. 10. Furthermore, while the flange 4a and the reservoir<br>
4b are integrally formed and made to operate as unit base 4 in the<br>
above described apparatus 1, they should not necessarily be<br>
integrally formed and, alternatively, they may be formed separately<br>
from each other. The flange 4a may be omitted if the apparatus 1<br>
is mounted to the top side of the fuel tank 2. Then, the unit base<br>
4 may take the form of a bottomed sleeve or, alternatively, it may<br>
take the form of a sleeve open both at the top and at the bottom<br>
and be fitted to the bottom of the fuel tank 2.<br>
Additionally, while the present invention is described above<br>
in terms of a fuel feed apparatus of a motor bicycle, the applicability<br>
of the present invention is by no means limited to motor bicycles<br>
and it can equally be used as fuel feed apparatus that is applicable<br>
to motor cars, carts for carrying caddy bags in golf courses, lawn<br>
mowers, industrial machines, portable generators and other machines<br>
comprising an internal combustion engine as source of motive power.<br>
Still additionally, the fuel to be used with a fuel feed apparatus<br>
according to the invention is not limited to gasoline but may<br>
alternatively be light oil or kerosene oil.<br>
As described above in detail, with a fuel feed apparatus<br>
according to the invention, the fuel pump and the strainer or the<br>
pressure regulator are held by a holder arranged at an upper portion<br>
of the reservoir and a coupling cover adapted to link the fuel pump<br>
and the strainer so that the fuel pump and the strainer or the pressure<br>
regulator can be linked together simply by arranging a coupling cover<br>
so streamline the apparatus and reduce both the size and the weight<br>
of the apparatus.<br>
Additionally, as a fuel flow path is arranged in the coupling<br>
cover and provided with a check valve, the coupling cover not only<br>
operates for coupling different components but also provides a space<br>
for receiving the check valve in order to fully exploit the available<br>
space and reduce the height of the apparatus.<br>
Still additionally, as the connecting section of the coupling<br>
cover to be connected to the fuel pump is provided with an engaging<br>
section to be engaged with the fuel pump, the connecting section<br>
is highly space-saving and adapted to connect the fuel pump and the<br>
coupling cover within a reduced space in order to further reduce<br>
the height of the apparatus.<br>
Additionally, the fuel returned from the pressure regulator<br>
may be fed back into the reservoir, then, all the fuel returned by<br>
the pressure regulator is put back into the reservoir so that all<br>
the fuel in the reservoir can be used without wasting and the engine<br>
can be fed with fuel on a highly stable basis. Still additionally,<br>
if the inside of the fuel in-take port is made to have a labyrinth<br>
structure, the effect of preventing fuel from flowing out through<br>
the fuel in-take port can be further enhanced.<br>
Finally, with a fuel feed apparatus according to the invention,<br>
the thermistor operating as sensor for sensing the volume of fuel<br>
left in the fuel tank is held by a thermistor arm made of an<br>
electrically conductive material and the thermistor arm is<br>
electrically connected to the strainer at an end and grounded at<br>
the other end so that it can be used as the grounding terminal of<br>
the strainer. Then, the thermistor and the structure share a common<br>
grounding terminal to eliminate the grounding wire of the strainer.<br>
Accordingly, both the thermistor and the strainer can be grounded<br>
by means of a single common wire to reduce the number of parts and<br>
also that of manufacturing steps.<br>
