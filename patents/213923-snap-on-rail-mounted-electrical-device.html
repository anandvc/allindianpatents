This invention relates to an electrical device comprising a rear part than can be snapped onto a support rail equipped with a locking edge and comprising in its rear part, at least one compression spring with an axis orthogonal to the length of the rail, arranged in a housing of a general cylindrical shape which opens onto the locking edge of the rail and offers a stop for the spring*<br>
Snapping electrical devices onto rails such as standardised sections is well known. The use of helical compression springs that can be applied directly onto the edge of the rail is also known, e,g. according to the document FR-2 551 807, The springs are generally assembled in their housing by inserting them via an opening on the rear of the device by forcing walls of the housing. The fact that the housing remains open at the rear of the device results in a risk of the spring being extracted from its housing, when non-axial strain is applied on the spring. Such non-axial strain is frequently encountered when devices are assembled or disassembled.<br>
The purpose of the invention is to prevent the risk of extraction of the compression springs used in electrical devices to lock them onto support rails such as standardised sections, in a low production cost solution.<br>
According to the invention, the housing opens onto the outside, opposite the rail locking edge, via an opening used for the axial insertion of the spring for<br><br>
its assembly and the housing comprises a spring support bearing surface opposite the stop, this bearing surface being inactive during the insertion of the spring and rendered active after the insertion of the spring.<br>
The bearing surface may be provided either on an elastic housing wall co-operating with a plain helical spring, e-g, by means of a ramped tongue and locking jaw or by means of a locking frame, or on a cavity of the device casing co-operating with a special helical spring, with, in this case, this spring being equipped with a transversal catch set to the locking position by rotation.<br>
The description will be made below using non-restrictive applications of the invention, illustrated by the drawings appended.<br>
Figure 1 is a vertical schematic view of an electrical device according to the invention.<br>
Figures 2a and 2b are perspective representations of two variants of the invention, before assembly of the springs.<br>
Figures 3 to 5 are enlarged sections of a spring housing, in the first variant, during the assembly of the spring, before engagement of the jaw and in the operating position, respectively*<br>
Figures 6 and 7 show the top view and section of the housing according to plane VII-VII of figure 5,<br>
Figure 8 is a section of the second variant.<br>
Figures 9 and 10 show a third variant.<br>
The electrical device illustrated in the figures is a low-voltage device equipped with an insulating casing 10, e.g. an insulating body or base, capable of<br><br>
snapping onto a top type support section rail 11, At its rear 12, i.e. on the side opposite its front 13 accessible to the operator, the casing 10 comprises two recesses 14a, 14b in which the ends 11a, lib of the rail can be inserted. Two helical springs 20 are each arranged in a cylindrical housing 15 provided in the casing, near its rear 12. Each spring comprises a bottom end spiral 20a and a top end spiral 20b (see figures 3 to 5).<br>
Each housing 15 comprises an axis Z orthogonal to the general direction L of the rail; the housing 15 opens onto the recess 14a via an opening 17 (see figures 3 and 5) in such a way that the spring 20, protruding slightly in the recess 14a, can lock against the edge of the rail with its bottom spiral 20a; the housing 15 opens to the top via an approximately circular opening 16 enabling the assembly of the spring.<br>
In the application in figures 2a and 3 to 7, the housing 15 is delimited at the front by a rigid wall 22 and at the rear by an elastic wall 23 and a rigid wall 24. The elastic wall 23 is located at the top, while the rigid wall 24 is located at the bottom.<br>
The elastic wall 23 is composed of a tongue 25 attached to the casing at its top end 25a and able to bend at its bottom end 25b. The tongue 25 is detached for this purpose from the panel 12 by lateral slots 26. The bottom end 25b of the tongue comprises a ramp 27 and a bearing surface composed of a jaw 28 than can be locked on the top spiral 20b of the spring. Therefore, in the operating position (figure 5), the spring is<br><br>
buttressed at the top on the jaw 28 of the elastic wall 23 and at the bottom on a stop 29 of the rigid wall 24 and is contained laterally by the fixed walls 22, 24. The tongue 25 is approximately in line with the rigid wall 24 to help define an appropriate attachment plane P at the rear 12 of the casing.<br>
In the application of figures 2b and 8, the elastic wall 23 forms a frame 30 embedded at its bottom end 31, while its top end forms a crosspiece 32 which is ended laterally with tips 32a intended to lock against shoulders 33 adjacent to the housing 15, The frame 30 comprises two legs 34 leaving a central space 35 between them in which the spring is housed, abutting at the top against a bearing surface 36 of the frame and at the bottom against the stop 29. The space 35 also comprises a catch 37 forming a lateral support for the spring.<br>
In the first variant, the spring is assembled as shown in figures 3 to 5. As seen in figure 3, it is inserted via the opening 17 and lowered by pushing into the housing 15 until its bottom spiraT 20a rests on the ramp 27. Thanks to the ramp, when the spring continues to move down, it deflects the elastic tongue 25 in the direction X perpendicul.ar to Z (see dotted line on figure 7) and then stops against the stop 29 (figure 4) . Then, the jaw 28 is pushed back in the opposite direction of X (following the arrow shown in figure 5) so that the top spiral 20b of the spring locks against the j aw and the spring and the tongue remain mutually buttressed in the operating position- In this position, the elastic wall 23 is approximately in line with the<br><br>
fixed wall 24, with the bottom end 25b of the tongue slightly retracted with reference to the plane P.<br>
In the second variant, suitable for longer springs, the frame 30, initially in the position drawn in figure 2b, is folded in the opposite direction of X to the position in figure 8, where the tips 32a lock against the shoulders 33, while the spring remains constrained in the space 35 of the frame.<br>
The pressure exerted by the device on the rail when the device is snapped on is conveyed by a slight compression of the spring, with the corresponding force taken up by the elastic wall on which the spring is buttressed, at the jaw 28 or the stop 36.<br>
In the third variant (figures 9 and 10) , the spring 20 comprises a top spiral 20b prolonged by a transversal catch 20c and the casing comprises a slot 40 which is directed parallel to the direction Z and communicates with the housing 15- The catch 20c slides into the slot when the spring is inserted into the housing and then, by pivoting the spring around its axis (merged with the Z axis), is engaged under a bearing surface 41 adjacent to the housing so as to remain captive in the housing.<br><br><br><br><br>
