NOVEL INDOLE-2,3-DIONE-3-OXIME DERIVATIVES<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to novel indole-2,3-dione-3-oxime derivatives capable of antagonising the effect of excitatory amino acids, such as glutamate. The invention also relates to a method of preparing the chemical compounds of the invention, to pharmaceutical compositions comprising the chemical compounds, and a method of treatment herewith.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Excessive excitation by neurotransmitters can cause the degeneration and death of neurones. It is believed that this degeneration is in part mediated by the excitotoxic actions of the excitatory amino acids (EAA), glutamate and aspartate, at the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), the alfa-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyI-4-isoxazoIe propionic acid (AMPA) receptor, and the kainate receptor. This excitotoxic action is responsible for the loss of neurones in cerebrovascular disorders such as cerebral ischemia or cerebral infarction resulting from a range of conditions, such as thromboembolic or haemorrhagic stroke, cerebral vasospasm, hypoglycaemia, cardiac arrest, status epilepticus, perinatal asphyxia, anoxia such as from near-drowning, pulmonary surgery and cerebral trauma as well as lathyrism, Alzheimer's, and Huntington's diseases. Compounds capable of blocking excitatory amino acid receptors are therefore considered useful for the treatment of the above disorders and diseases, as well as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), schizophrenia, Parkinsonism, epilepsy, anxiety, pain and drug addiction.<br>

Steric Isomers<br>
Some of the chemical compounds of the present invention exist in (+) and (-) forms as well as in racemic forms.<br>
Racemic forms can be resolved into the optical antipodes by known methods, for example* by separation of diastereomeric salts thereof, with an optically active acid, and liberating the optically active amine compound by treatment with a base. Another method for resolving racemates into the optical antipodes is based upon chromatography on an optical active matrix. Racemic compounds of the present invention can thus be resolved into their optical antipodes, e.g., by fractional cr/stallisation of d- or I- (tartrates, mandelates, or camphorsulphonate) salts for example.<br>
The chemical compounds of the present invention may also be resolved by the formation of diastereomeric amides by reaction of the chemical compounds of the present invention with an optically active activated carboxylic acid such as that derived from (+) or (-) phenylalanine, (+) or (-) phenylglycine, (+) or (-) camphanic acid or by ) the formation of diastereomeric carbamates by reaction of the chemical compound of the present invention with an optically active chloroformate or the like.<br><br>
Additional methods for the resolving the optical isomers are known in the art. Such methods include those described by Jaques J, Collet A, &amp; Wilen S in 'Enantiomers, Racemates, and Resolutions", John Wiley and Sons, New York (1981).<br>
Moreover, being oximes, the chemical compounds of the invention may exist in two forms, syn- and anti-form, depending on the arrangement of the substituents around the -C=N- double bond. A chemical compound of the present invention may thus be the syn- or the anti-form, or it may be a mixture hereof.<br>
Pharmaceutically Acceptable Salts<br>
The novel indole-2,3-dione-3-oxime derivatives of the invention may be provided in any form suitable for the intended administration. Suitable forms include pharmaceutically (i.e. physiologically) acceptable salts.<br>

Such salts are formed by procedures well known in the art.<br>
Other acids such as oxalic acid, while not in themselves pharmaceutically acceptable, may be useful in the preparation of salts useful as intermediates in obtaining a chemical compound of the invention and its pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt.<br>
Metal salts of a chemical compound of the invention includes alkali metal i salts, such as the sodium salt, of a chemical compound of the invention containing a carboxy group.<br>
The chemical compound of the invention may be provided in solved or dissolved form together with a pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water, ethanol and the like. In general, solved forms are considered equivalent to dissolved 3 forms for the purposes of this invention.<br><br>
Pharmaceutical Compositions<br>
In another aspect the invention provides novel pharmaceutical compositions comprising a therapeutically effective amount of the chemical compound of the invention. While a chemical compound of the invention for use in therapy may be administered in the form of the raw chemical compound, it is preferred to introduce the active ingredient, optionally in the form of a physiologically acceptable salt in a pharmaceutical composition together with one or more excipients, carriers and/or diluents.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the invention provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising the chemical compound of the invention or a pharmaceutical^ acceptable salt or derivative thereof together with one or more pharmaceutical^/ acceptable carriers therefor and, optionally, other therapeutic and/or prophylactic ingredients. The carrier(s) must be "acceptable" in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions those suitable for oral, rectal, nasal, topical (including buccal and sub-lingual), vaginal or parenteral (including intramuscular, subcutaneous and intravenous) administration, or in a form suitable for administration by inhalation or insufflation.<br>
The chemical compound of the invention, together with a conventional adjuvant, carrier, or diluent, may thus be placed into the form of pharmaceutical compositions and unit dosages thereof, and in such form may be employed as solids, such as tablets or filled capsules, or liquids such as solutions, suspensions, emulsions, elixirs, or capsules filled with the same, all for oral use, in the form of suppositories for rectal administration; or in the form of sterile injectable solutions for parenteral (including subcutaneous) use. Such pharmaceutical compositions and unit dosage forms thereof may comprise conventional ingredients in conventional proportions, with or without additional active compounds or principles, and such unit dosage forms may contain any suitable effective amount of the active ingredient commensurate with the ) intended daily dosage range to be employed. Compositions containing ten (10) milligrams of active ingredient or, more broadly, 0.1 to one hundred (100) milligrams, per tablet, are accordingly suitable representative unit dosage forms.<br><br>
The chemical compound of the present invention can be administrated in a wide variety of oral and parenteral dosage forms. It will be obvious to those skilled in the art that the following dosage forms may comprise, as the active component, either a chemical compound of the invention or a pharmaceutical^ acceptable salt of a chemical compound of the invention.<br>
For preparing pharmaceutical compositions from a chemical compound of the present invention, pharmaceutical^ acceptable carriers can be either solid or liquid. Solid form preparations include powders, tablets, pills, capsules, cachets, suppositories, and dispersible granules. A solid carrier can be one or more substances which may also act as diluents, flavouring agents, solubilizers, lubricants, suspending agents, binders, preservatives, tablet disintegrating agents, or an encapsulating material.<br>
In powders, the carrier is a finely divided solid which is in a mixture with the finely divided active component.<br>
In tablets, the active component is mixed with the carrier having the necessary binding capacity in suitable proportions and compacted in the shape and size desired.<br>
The powders and tablets preferably contain from five or ten to about seventy percent of the active compound. Suitable carriers are magnesium carbonate, magnesium stearate, talc, sugar, lactose, pectin, dextrin, starch, gelatin, tragacanth, methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, a low melting wax, cocoa butter, and the like. The term "preparation" is intended to include the formulation of the active compound with encapsulating material as carrier providing a capsule in which the active component, with or without carriers, is surrounded by a carrier, which is thus in association with it. Similarly, cachets and lozenges are included. Tablets, powders, capsules, pills, cachets, and lozenges can be used as solid forms suitable for oral administration.<br>
For preparing suppositories, a low melting wax, such as a mixture of fatty acid glycerides or cocoa butter, is first melted and the active component is dispersed homogeneously therein, as by stirring. The molten homogenous mixture is then poured into convenient sized moulds, allowed to cool, and thereby to solidify.<br><br>
Compositions suitable for vaginal administration may be presented as pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or sprays containing in addition to the active ingredient such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate.<br>
Liquid preparations include solutions, suspensions, and emulsions, for example, water or water-propylene glycol solutions. For example, parenteral injection liquid preparations can be formulated as solutions in aqueous polyethylene glycol solution.<br>
The chemical compound according to the present invention may thus be formulated for parenteral administration (e.g. by injection, for example bolus injection or continuous infusion) and may be presented in unit dose form in ampoules, pre-filled syringes, small volume infusion or in multi-dose containers with an added preservative. The compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions, or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilising and/or dispersing agents. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form, obtained by aseptic isolation of sterile solid or by lyophilisation from solution, for constitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g. sterile, pyrogen-free water, before use.<br>
Aqueous solutions suitable for oral use can be prepared by dissolving the active component in .water and adding suitable colorants, flavours, stabilising and thickening agents, as desired.<br>
, Aqueous suspensions suitable for oral use can be made by dispersing the finely divided active component in water with viscous material, such as natural or synthetic gums, resins, methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, or other well known suspending agents.<br>
Also included are solid form preparations which are intended to be converted, shortly before use, to liquid form preparations for oral administration. Such liquid forms include solutions, suspensions, and emulsions. These preparations may contain, in addition to the active component, colorants, flavours, stabilisers, buffers, artificial and natural sweeteners, dispersants, thickeners, solubilizing agents, and the like.<br>
For topical administration to the epidermis the chemical compound according to the invention may be formulated as ointments, creams or lotions, or as a transdermal patch. Ointments and creams may, for example, be formulated with an<br><br>
aqueous or oily base with the addition of suitable thickening and/or gelling agents. Lotions may be formulated with an aqueous or oily base and will in general also contain one or more emulsifying agents, stabilising agents, dispersing agents, suspending agents, thickening agents, or colouring agents.<br>
Compositions suitable for topical administration in the mouth include lozenges comprising the active agent in a flavoured base, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth; pastilles comprising the active ingredient in an inert base such as gelatin and glycerin or sucrose and acacia; and mouthwashes comprising the active ingredient in a suitable liquid carrier.<br>
Solutions or suspensions are applied directly to the nasal cavity by conventional means, for example with a dropper, pipette or spray. The compositions may be provided in single or multi-dose form. In the latter case of a dropper or pipette, this may be achieved by the patient administering an appropriate, predetermined volume of the solution or suspension. In the case of a spray, this may be achieved for example by means of a metering atomising spray pump.<br>
Administration to the respiratory tract may also be achieved by means of an aerosol formulation in which the active ingredient is provided in a pressurised pack with a suitable propellant such as a chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) for example dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, or dichlorotetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide, or other suitable gas. The aerosol may conveniently also contain a surfactant such as lecithin. The dose of drug may be controlled by provision of a metered valve.<br>
'Alternatively the active ingredients may be provided in the form of a dry powder, for example a powder mix of the compound in a suitable powder base such as lactose, starch, starch derivatives such as hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). Conveniently the powder carrier will form a gel in the nasal cavity. The powder composition may be presented in unit dose form for example in capsules or cartridges of, e.g., gelatin, or blister packs from which the powder may be administered by means of an inhaler.<br>
in compositions intended for administration to the respiratory tract, including intranasal compositions, the compound will generally have a small particle size for example of the order of 5 microns or less. Such a particle size may be obtained by means known in the art, for example by micronization.<br><br>
When desired, compositions adapted to give sustained release of the active ingredient may be employed.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations are preferably in unit dosage forms. In such form, the preparation is subdivided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the active component. The unit dosage form can be a packaged preparation, the package containing discrete quantities of preparation, such as packaged tablets, capsules, and powders in vials or ampoules. Also, the unit dosage form can be a capsule, tablet, cachet, or lozenge itself, or it can be the appropriate number of any of these in packaged form.<br>
Tablets or capsules for oral administration and liquids for intravenous administration and continuous infusion are preferred compositions.<br>

Example 24 Biological Activity<br>
In an in vitro activity (receptor affinity) test, the chemical compounds of the present invention have been tested for their affinity for the AMPA receptor.<br>
L-glutamate (GLU) is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central neivous system. From electro-physiological- and binding studies, there appear to be at least three subtypes of GLU receptors, tentatively named N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, quisqualate receptors and kainate receptors.<br><br>
AMPA has been known for several years to be a potent and selective agonist at the traditionally named quisqualate receptors. Activation of quisqualate receptors by AMPA is associated with Na+ influx and K+ efflux leading to depolarisation. 3H-AMPA is a selective radioligand for labelling the ionotropic quisqualate (AMPA) receptors.<br>
Tissue preparation<br>
Preparations are performed at 0-4°C unless otherwise indicated. Cerebral cortex from male Wistar rats (150-200 g) is homogenised for 5-10 sec in 20 ml Tris-HCI (30 mM, pH 7.4) using an Ultra-Turrax™ homogeniser. The suspension is centrifuged at 27,000 x g for 15 minutes and the pellet is washed three times with Duffer (centrifuged at 27,000 x g for 10 minutes). The washed pellet is homogenised in 20 ml of buffer and incubated on a water bath (of 37°C) for 30 minutes to remove endogenous glutamate and then centrifuged for 10 minutes at 27,000 x g. The pellet is then homogenised in buffer and centrifuged at for 10 minutes at 27,000 x g. The final pellet is resuspended in 30 ml buffer and the preparation is frozen and stored at -20°C.<br>
Assay<br>
The membrane preparation is thawed and centrifuged at 2°C for 10 minutes at 27,000 x g. The pellet is washed twice with 20 ml 30 mM Tris-HCI containing 2.5 mM CaCI2, pH 7.4, using an Ultra-Turrax™ homogeniser and centrifuged for 10 minutes at 27,000 x g. The final pellet is resuspended in 30 mM Tris-HCI containing 2.5 mM CaCI2 and 100 mM KSCN, pH 7.4 (100 ml per g of original tissue) and used for binding assays. Aliquots of 0.5 (0.2) ml are added to 25 (20) nl of test solution and 25 (20) [i\ of 3H-AMPA (5 nM, final concentration), mixed and incubated for 30 minutes at 2°C. Non-specific binding is determined using L-glutamate (0.6 mM, final concentration).<br>
After incubation the 550 \\\ samples are added 5 ml of ice-cold buffer and poured directly onto Whatman™ GF/C glass fibre filters under suction and immediately washed with 5 ml of ice-cold buffer. The 240 \s\ samples are filtered over glass fibre filter using a Skatron™ cell harvester. The filters are washed with 3 ml ice-cold buffer. The amount of radioactivity on the filters is determined by conventional liquid scintillation counting. Specific binding is total binding minus non-specific binding.<br><br>
The test value is given as the IC50 (the concentration (yM) of the test substance which inhibits the specific binding of 3H-AMPA by 50%).<br>
From this test it was found that:<br>
