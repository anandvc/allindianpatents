MEDICAMENTS FOR CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC TREATMENT OF DISEASE<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This application is based on provisional application USSN 60/218,464 filed July 14, 2000 which is a continuation-in-part of USSN 09/130,041, filed on August 6, 1998; USSN 60/149,015, filed on August 13,1999 and 09/635,276 filed on August 9,2000; and USSN 60/191,803, filed on March 24,2000 and 09/799,785 filed March 6, 2001, which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety.<br>
The present invention is related to certain chemotherapeutic medicaments and methods for treatment of human or animal tissue using chemotherapy.<br>
Chemotherapy was developed to treat cancer and other disease with the promise of limiting the invasiveness of the therapeutic intervention. Ideally in the practice of chemotherapy, chemical agents that afford selective toxicity to diseased or otherwise undesirable tissue are administered to a patient. Frequently, these agents are administered systemically, with the expectation that the viability of certain tissues, such as the rapidly proliferating tissues of a cancerous tumor, will be selectively inhibited or destroyed. Unfortunately, most chemotherapeutic agents presently available offer limited specificity for such tissue, resulting in a high incidence of disagreeable side-effects, such as immune system suppression, nausea, and hair loss. While tremendous strides have been made in an effort to reduce or mitigate such side-effects, there still continues to be great difficulty in enhancement of specificity of the drug for tissues to be treated.<br>
Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide new chemotherapeutic medicaments, new medical uses for such medicaments based on improved specificity of such, medicaments for the desired target tissue to be treated, and methods for treatment using such medicaments, thereby resulting in improved treatment outcomes, increased efficacy and safety and reduced cost of treatment.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to new chemotherapeutic medicaments and certain medical uses of such medicaments, and methods for treatment using such medicaments, for treatment of human or animal tissue, wherein a primary active component of such medicaments is a halogenated xanthene or a halogenated xanthene<br><br>
derivative. In a preferred embodiment, the halogenated xanthene is Rose Bengal or a functional derivative of Rose Bengal. The halogenated xanthenes constitute a family of extremely useful agents that can be selectively delivered at high concentrations to certain tissues. Selective retention of such agents at high concentrations in the desired tissues results in decreased viability or death of such tissues (and hence provides a chemotherapeutic use of medicaments containing agents). Such medicaments are suitable for intracorporeal administration, and are thus intracorporeal chemotherapeutic medicaments. Such medicaments are also suitable for topical administration, and are thus topical chemotherapeutic medicaments. Such medicaments can also be called pharmaceutical compositions or agents.<br>
Such chemotherapeutic medicaments are useful for the treatment of a variety of conditions affecting the skin and related organs, the mouth and digestive tract and related organs, the urinary and reproductive tracts and related organs, the respiratory tract and related organs, the circulatory system and related organs, the head and neck, the endocrine and lymphoreticular systems and related organs, various other tissues, such as connecti ve tissues and various tissue surfaces exposed during surgery, as well as various tissues exhibiting microbial, viral, fungal or parasitic infection. These medicaments are available in various formulations that may include liquid, semisolid, solid or aerosol delivery vehicles, and are suitable for intracorporeal administration via various conventional modes and routes, including intravenous injection (/.v.), intraperitoneal injection (/.p.). intramuscular injection (int.), intracranial injection (/.a), intratumoral injection (it.), intraepithelial injection (i.e.), transcutaneous delivery (t.c), and per oesophageal ip a ) administration. Additionally, such medicaments are suitable for topical administration \ ia various conventional modes and routes, including topical application directly to or proximal to certain tissues. The active ingredients in such chemotherapeutic medicaments produce a desirable therapeutic response, such as destruction of microbial infection, reduction or elimination of tissue irritation, reduction or elimination of hyperpro life ran ve tissue, reduction or elimination of cancerous or precancerous tissue, reduction or elimination of surface or subsurface lipocytes or lipid deposits, and many other similar indications.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, such chemotherapeutic medicaments are used for treatment of a variety of conditions affecting the skin and related organs.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, such chemotherapeutic medicaments arc used<br><br>
for treatment of a variety of conditions affecting the mouth and digestive tract and related<br>
organs.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, such chemotherapeutic medicaments are used for treatment of a variety of conditions affecting the urinary and reproductive tracts and<br>
related organs.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, such chemotherapeutic medicaments are used for treatment of a variety of conditions affecting the respiratory system and related organs.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, such chemotherapeutic medicaments are used for treatment of a variety of conditions affecting the circulatory system and related organs.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, such chemotherapeutic medicaments are used for treatment of a variety of conditions affecting the head and neck.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, such chemotherapeutic medicaments are used for treatment of a variety of conditions affecting the endocrine and lymphoreticular systems and related organs.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, such chemotherapeutic medicaments are used for treatment of a variety of conditions affecting various other tissues, such as connective tissues and various tissue surfaces exposed during surgery.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, such chemotherapeutic medicaments are used for treatment of a variety of conditions related to microbial or parasitic infection.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, such chemotherapeutic medicaments are produced in various formulations including liquid, semisolid, solid or aerosol delivery vehicles, as well as in tablet, capsule, suppository, and other similar forms.<br>

1.        Properties   of  the   preferred   active   components and medicament formulations.<br>
The inventors of the present invention have discovered a class of agents that are broadly applicable for producing chemotherapeutic medicaments for treatment of disease in certain human and animal tissues. These agents are referred to as halogenated xanthenes and are illustrated in FIGURE la, where the symbols X, Y, and Z represent various elements present at the designated positions, and the symbols Rl and R2 represent various functionalities present at the designated positions.<br>
Selected properties (such as chemical constituents at positions X, Y, and Z and functionalities R1 and R2) of representative halogenated xanthenes are summarized in attached Table 1. Certain general properties of this class of agent are discussed in further detail in USSN 09/130,041 filed on August 6, 1998, USSN 09/184,388 filed on November 2, 1998, USSN 09/216,787 filed on December 21, 1998, USSN 09/635,276 filed on August 9,2000, USSN 09/799,785 filed March 6,2001, and USSN 09/817,448 filed March 26, 2001, which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety. In general, the halogenated xanthenes are characterized by a low cytotoxicity (toxicity to cells) at low concentration, a propensity for selective concentration or retention in certain tissues and cells, a high cytotoxicity upon such concentration or retention, and by chemical and physical properties that are substantially unaffected by the local chemical environment or by the attachment of functional derivatives at positions R1 and R2. Such factors make these chemical agents, and in particular chemotherapeutic medicaments<br><br>
formulated from such agents, excellent for the treatment of disease in human and animal<br>
tissues.<br>
It is thus one preferred embodiment of the present invention that a chemotherapeutic medicament be produced that contains, as an active ingredient at a concentration of from greater than approximately 0.001 % to less than approximately 20%, at least one halogenated xanthene.<br>
It is preferred that this medicament include the halogenated xanthene Rose Bengal (4,5,6,7-Tetrachloro-2,,4',5r,7,-tetraiodofluorescein, illustrated in FIGURE lb).<br>
Examples of other halogenated xanthenes which can be used in the medicaments of the present invention include one or more of the following Fluorescein derivatives: 4\5'-Dichlorofluorescein; 2\7'-Dichlorofluorescein; 4,5,6,7-Tetrachlorofluorescein; 2',4'.5',7-TetrachIorofluorescein; Dibromofluorescein; Solvent Red 72; Diiodofluorescein; Eosin B; Eosin Y; Ethyl Eosin; Erythrosin B; Phloxine B; Rose Bengal; 4,5,6,7-Tetrabromoerythrosin; Mono-, Di-, or Tribromoerythrosin; Mono-, Di-, or Trichloroerythrosin; Mono-, Di-, or Trifluoroerythrosin; 2',7'-Dichloro-4,5,6J-Tetrafluoro fluorescein; 2\4,5,6,7,7'-Hexafluorofluorescein; 4,5.6,7-Tetrafluoro fluorescein, 2',4\5,5\6,7'-Hexaiodofluorescein; 2\4\5,5\7,7'-Hexaiodofluorescein; 2',4',5\6,7,7'-Hexaiodofluorescein; 2\ 4', 5,5', 6,7,7'-Heptaiodofluorescein;4-Chloro-2f,4,,5,5,,6,7,-hexaiodofluorescein;4-Chlo^o-2,,4,,5,5',7,7,-hexaiodofluorescein; 4-Chloro-2',4,,5,,6,7,7'-hexaiodofluorescein; 4-ChIoro-2',4',5,5,,6,7,7'-heptaiodofluorescein;4,5-Dichloro-2',4,,5,,6,7,7,-hexaiodofluorescein;4,6-Dichloro-2,,4',5,5',7,7'-hexaiodofluorescein; and 4,7-Dichloro-2',4',5,5\6J'-hexaiodofluorescein.<br>
As an example of these desirable chemical, biochemical, and physical properties, the inventors have found that the prototypical halogenated xanthene, Rose Bengal, will accumulate preferentially in (e.g., target) some tumors and other tissues and pathogenic entities and exhibit high cytotoxicity within such tumors, tissues and pathogenic entities, while exhibiting negligible systemic cytotoxicity or local cytotoxicity in surrounding healthy tissues. Such agents also possess the ability to clear rapidly from healthy tissue in the body.   Furthermore, such agents have a relatively low cost.<br>
For example, to a first approximation, an agent's potential for tissue accumulation can be estimated based on the partition coefficient, Kp. This in vitro parameter is purported to have predictive value relating to in vivo agent delivery at the cellular level.<br><br>
In particular, a value greater than unity is considered to indicate agents capable of localizing in tumor or other diseased tissue, and thereby being capable of exhibiting enhanced chemotherapeutic efficacy in such tissue. Kp is determined by measuring the ratio of equilibrium concentrations of an agent in a lipophilic phase (/?-octanoI) contacted with an aqueous phase (phosphate buffered saline, PBS, pH = 7.4). Comparative values of Kp are shown in Table 2. The large Kp values for the halogenated xanthenes suggest that the halogenated xanthenes will exhibit a preference for concentration or accumulation in tumor or other diseased tissue, and should thereby be capable of exhibiting superior chemotherapeutic efficacy in such tissue. However, as explained below, the inventors have discovered that halogenated xanthenes exhibit a much greater chemotherapeutic efficacy in such tissue than could be predicted solely from the Kp values shown in Table 2.<br>
The following examples illustrate this preference for accumulation in tumor tissue by the halogenated xanthenes:<br>
Tumor cell suspensions (e.g., melanoma, breast tumor, liver tumor, renal carcinoma, gall bladder tumor or prostate tumor) were injected subcutaneously into the flanks of nude mice and resulted in the formation of primary tumors', within a few weeks, at the injection site having a volume of approximately 0.25 cm3. A solution of Rose Bengal (50-100 (iL of 0.5% Rose Bengal in saline) was then administered by intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) to the tumor-bearing mice, and the injected mice sacrificed at timed intervals following injection. Tissue samples (liver, abdominal wall, and tumor) were immediately obtained from the sacrificed mice, homogenized, centrifiiged for 10 minutes at 1520 xg9 and the resulting supernatant collected and analyzed fluorimetricalty. This allowed the pharmacokinetics of the administered Rose Bengal to be easily observed, as illustrated in FIGURE 2. The data in FIGURE 2 show that Rose Bengal rapidly diffuses from normal tissue (e.g., abdominal wall) and is efficiently entrapped and excreted through the liver, with concentrations in these tissues diminishing to unmeasurable lev els within 24 hours. At the same time, persistent accumulation occurs in tumor tissue, u ith greater than 50% of maximum measured agent concentration maintained in such tissues for periods in excess of 24 hours.<br>
If such implanted tumors are directly injected with Rose Bengal, similar select i \ e. persistent accumulation occurs.<br>
For example, BNL/SV40 liver cell tumor cells injected into the flanks of nude<br><br>
mice, as described supra, resulted in the formation of primary tumors, within a few weeks, at the injection site and have a volume of approximately 0.25 cm3. Intratumoral (/./.) and peritumoral (p.t.) injection of a 10% solution of Rose Bengal (50 \xL of 10% Rose Bengal in saline) resulted in marked red staining of the tumor and the surrounding flank. Within 7 days this Rose Bengal cleared from normal tissue, but the tumor tissue remained stained. Over a period of several weeks the previously rapidly growing tumor exhibited stasis, with no significant change in tumor volume and a marked absence of mitotic figures {e.g., exhibiting only non-hyperproliferative cells).<br>
Further, peritumoral injection alone (e.g., injection into normal tissue around the outside margins of the tumor) of the above Rose Bengal exhibited no detectable retention in normal tissue after 24 hours. Notably, no significant effect on normal tissue, nor on the adjacent tumor tissue, was noted upon peritumoral injection alone.<br>
Hence, the administered Rose Bengal in these examples not only exhibited selective, persistent accumulation in tumor tissue, but this accumulated agent also exhibits chemotherapeutic efficacy with minimal or no measurable side effects in healthy tissue.<br>
This chemotherapeutic effect for Rose Bengal is further illustrated by the following example. An adult, female dog with a naturally-occurring, recurrent aggressive sarcoma tumor (approximately 20 cc in volume) was treated by injection of approximately 5 cc of a 10% solution of Rose Bengal at several locations throughout the tumor volume. After a period of five days, a follow-up examination of the animal indicated a measurable decrease in tumor density along with significant edema and apparent necrosis of large sections of the tumor. Another follow-up examination after 19 days indicated a further measurable decrease in tumor size. Such a response is indicative of chemotherapeutic activity of the injected Rose Bengal within the tumor mass. It is also notable that no significant side-effects were noted in the healthy tissue surrounding the tumor.<br>
In contrast, /./. administration of a different class of agent, indocyanine green (Kp = 99), into various murine tumors showed that within 24 hours this agent substantively migrates out of tumors, with residual agent tending to accumulate in peritumoral tissues. Moreover, no chemotherapeutic effect was evidenced upon such administration of such agent. Hence, while the Kp value for indocyanine green is nearly ten-fold larger than that of Rose Bengal (and as such, indocyanine green is, by the conventional model based solely on Kp, expected to accumulate strongly in tumor tissue), the tissue localization properties of the two agents are clearly completely different. Furthermore, even at the relatively high<br><br>
concentrations in the immediate vicinity of the injection site, indocvanine green was found to exhibit no chemotherapeutic activity.<br>
Thus, the halogenated xanthenes, and in particular Rose Bengal, exhibit an unexpectedly marked preference for selective accumulation and retention in tumor and other diseased tissue upon administration, and that once present in such tissue, said halogenated xanthenes can be utilized as potent, highly tissue- or disease- specific chemotherapeutic agents.<br>
The toxicology data shown in Table 2 indicate that the halogenated xanthenes are relatively non-toxic, and yet, in contrast to agents such as indocyanine green, they exhibit unanticipated chemotherapeutic properties. One possible explanation for this may be that such chemotherapeutic properties of the halogenated xanthenes, and in particular of Rose Bengal, are the result of their special combination of modest intrinsic cytotoxicity and marked propensity for persistent, selective accumulation in certain cells, such as cancerous cells: based, for example, on simple first-order kinetics, such modestly cytotoxic agents, upon becoming present in cells at high local concentrations for extended periods of time, should exhibit chemotherapeutic properties.<br>
The inventors tested this hypothesis by evaluating the chemotherapeutic properties of Rose Bengal and Erythrosin B on cultures of the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus. These data are illustrated in FIGURES 3 and 4. In both illustrations, test cultures were exposed to the indicated agents at the indicated concentrations for the indicated times; cytotoxicity was subsequently estimated by serial dilution (1 OX dilution per step) of the treated cell cultures into 96-well plates containing fresh culture media; these samples were then incubated under standard conditions. Viability (e.g., Logs of Growth) for each test culture was then estimated by counting the number of dilution steps resulting in positive cell growth. Cytotoxicity upon exposure to a particular agent is thereby estimated by the reduction in viability relative to unexposed (e.g., control) cultures. FIGURE 3 illustrates the cytotoxic effects of a 90 minute exposure of S. aureus to either Rose Bengal or Erythrosin B. In this figure, Rose Bengal exhibits a marked chemotherapeutic response that is concentration dependent, while Erythrosin B exhibits no significant chemotherapeutic response for this brief exposure duration over the range of concentrations tested. FIGURE 4 illustrates the cytotoxic effects on S. aureus for various durations of exposure to Rose Bengal or Erythrosin B (each administered at a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL). These data show that the chemotherapeutic properties of<br><br>
the halogenated xanthenes are dependent on exposure time. Notably, the negative slopes for the trend lines of both agents are indicative of cumulative cytotoxicity that is time dependent. The shallower slope for Erythrosin B indicates lower cytotoxicity in this model (e.g. S. aureus), consistent with the results illustrated in FIGURE 3. Hence, certain agents that exhibit a modest, but nonetheless finite, cytotoxicity (such as for example, but not limited to, the halogenated xanthenes) should afford chemotherapeutic modality when administered to certain tissues, wherein such administration results in sufficient local concentration of such agents for a sufficient period so as to cause local cytotoxic effects (e.g., chemotherapy) in such tissues.<br>
In addition to superior suitability for direct administration into desired targeted tissue to be treated, such as a focal tumor, the preference of the halogenated xanthenes for accumulation in certain types of tissues provides a basis for highly-selective, systemic delivery of the halogenated xanthenes to such tissues. For example, Rose Bengal's relatively large partition coefficient is indicative of a preference for accumulation in lipophilic tissue, such as cutaneous lipocytes. Systemic administration of Rose Bengal, for example as an aqueous solution administered via intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) or per oesophagus (p.o.) administration, resulted in highly selective accumulation of said agent in certain tissues, such as in the cutaneous fat deposits of obese laboratory mice. Histologic examination of skin samples from such animals showed that the accumulated agent was substantively limited to cutaneous lipocytes.<br>
Moreover, the facility with which the halogenated xanthenes target specific tissues or other sites can be further optimized by attachment of specific functional derivatives at positions R1 and R2, so as to change the chemical partitioning and/ or biological activity of the agent. For example, attachment of one targeting moiety or more at positions R1 or R2 can be used to improve targeting to specific tissues, such as cancerous tumor tissues or sites of localized infection. An example of this is esterification at position Rl with a short aliphatic alcohol, such as n-hexanol, to produce a derivatized agent exhibiting enhanced partitioning into lipid-rich tumor tissues.<br>
It is thus a further preferred embodiment that at least one of the at least one halogenated xanthene active ingredients includes at least one targeting moiety selected from a group that includes deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), ribonucleic acid (RNA). amino acids, proteins, antibodies, ligands, haptens, carbohydrate receptors or complexing agents, lipid receptors or complexing agents, protein receptors or complexing agents, chelators.<br><br>
encapsulating vehicles, short- or long-chain aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbons, including those containing aldehydes, ketones, alcohols, esters, amides, amines, nitriles, azides, or other hydrophilic or hydrophobic moieties. A further example of this embodiment is derivatization of Rose Bengal with a lipid (at position R!, via esterification), so as to increase the lipophilicity of Rose Bengal, and thereby modify its targeting properties in a patient. An additional further example of this embodiment is derivatization of Rose Bengal with folate (at position R\ via esterification or other modes of attachment), so as to increase selective targeting of cancer and other cells exhibiting enhanced folate receptor activity or folate metabolism.<br>
As a further example of the desirable chemical, biochemical, and physical properties of the halogenated xanthenes and halogenated xanthene derivatives, the inventors of the present invention have shown that these agents are readily cleared from healthy tissues in a matter of several hours, and are rapidly excreted in bile, urine and feces, without doing damage to healthy tissue while in the body. Further examples of the desirable properties.of the halogenated xanthenes and halogenated xanthene derivatives are that the halogenated xanthenes and halogenated xanthene derivatives are easily synthesized using simple, low-cost synthetic methods, can be readily purified, and exhibit excellent stability (such as a long shelf life without need for refrigeration or storage under an inert atmosphere).<br>
Because the halogenated xanthenes and their derivatives are, in general, fine solid powders in their pure form, it is preferred that, for proper delivery to desired tissues, such agents be formulated in appropriate delivery vehicles. Specifically, such formulations are preferred so as to facilitate agent delivery into the body and subsequent contact with, and delivery to, desired tissues to be treated.
