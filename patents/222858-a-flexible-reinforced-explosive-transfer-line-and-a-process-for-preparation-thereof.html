fiber glass yarn is done on the MDC. Three such coatings and braidings are done in succession. Finally, a resin coating is given to the said coated MDC. The uniformity of the cord is ensured by passing the complete cord through a suitable gauge. After curing of resin at room temperature for 42 to 48 hours, a consolidated MDC is attained, over which a final braiding of three layers with fiber glass yarn is done to obtain the desired outer diameter of the cord. The said fiber glass braided MDC is inserted into a nylon sleeve which is further braided with a layer of stainless steel wire.<br>
The braiding of stainless steel wire and fibre glass yarn along with the nylon sleeve are removed from the surface to expose the consolidated MDC, for about 20 to 30mm in length from both the ends. The connector rods are inserted over this MDC, from both the ends, and held in position with an adhesive like cyanocrylate. The open space between the face of the connector rod and reinforcement of MDC if any, is filled with araldite. The terminals of the said MDC are cut such that they are projecting about 2mm above the other face of connector rod at both the ends. Each end of said MDC is inserted into the filled booster cup, touching the said booster compositions based on PETN or RDX and the excess empty portion is crimped over the connector rod. Each end of assembly is housed in a stainless steel body and the body is crimped on the braided portion.

DESCRIPTION OF EXPLOSIVE TRANSFER LINE W.R.T. DRAWINGS:<br>
The vertical section of flexible reinforced explosive transfer line (FRETL) at Fig 1(a) illustrates the details of braided MDC of the present invention which incorporates a Miniature Detonating Cord (MDTJ) (1) which is a lead alloy tube of size 1.6 to 1.7 mm outer diameter, about 0.6 to 0.7 mm internal diameter. The uniformity of the tube is ensured by passing the MDC through a suitable gauge. The MDC (1) is coated with a resin over which is braided with fibre glass yarn thrice. A final coat of resin is applied to attain finished MDC of the required diameter and allowed to cure to attain a consolidated MDC (2). Further the said MDC (2) is braided thrice with a fiber glass yarn to attain a fiber glass braided MDC(3) and is inserted into a Nylon sleeve (4) of suitable thickness and diameter. One layer of SS wire is braided over the Nylon sleeve (4). The final diameter of the steel braided MDC (5) from both ends. A gap if any between the face of the connector rod (6) and shield of the said MDC (5) is filled with araldite (11). The tip of MDC (2) is cut such that it is about 2mm above the surface of the connector rod (6). The tip of MDC is inserted into a booster cup (7) containing about 70 mg of loose booster explosive (10) and crimped over connector. The above said assembly, containing connector rod (6) and booster cup (7) at both the ends is housed in a stainless steel body (8) is crimped on the braided portion. A stainless steel cap (9) is sliding over the stainless steel braided MDC (5) for securing the terminal end of FRETL to the junction box. Fig 2 shows the explosive filled Aluminium cup (12) in contact with booster cup (7) and protruding male thread portion (13) of the junction box over which female threads of the cap (9) are fastened. A protective cover (14) protects the booster cup and female threads of the cap during transit and storage.<br>
PREPARATION   OF   FLEXIBLE   REINFORCED   EXPLOSIVE TRANSFER LINE (FRETL) :<br>
The process of preparation comprises of following three steps:-<br><br>
a) Preparation of Miniature Detonating Cord (MDC):<br>
A lead alloy tube of size 7.0 to 10.0 mm outer diameter (OD) and 3.0 to 5.0 mm inner diameter (ID) is cut into a length of about 60 cm. Gauges of suitable diameter are passed through the ID to ensure uniformity. The tube is sealed by crimping from one end and is weighed on a balance with 0.5 g accuracy. The tube is filled with the explosive using a brass funnel in installments of approximately lg each. After addition of each installment of the explosive, the closed end of the tube is tapped for two minutes slowly on a table to ensure uniformity. The tube is filled uniformly leaving about 5mm from the filling end and is later sealed by crimping. The said filled tube is weighed to the nearest 0.5 g'. The lead tube thus prepared is passed successively through truncated grooves of reduced areas of a roller to obtain outer diameter of 3-4 mm. The truncated cord is then drawn through a set of dies on a drawing bench to attain a circular cord of 1.6 to 1.7 mm OD. During this process there is a corresponding increase in the length of the tube. The total length of the tube is 12.0 to 12.5 m called the miniature detonating cord (MDC) (1) The loading density in g/m of MDC is determined by chemical method. The continuity in the explosive filling is confirmed by non-destructive test methods like Neutron radiography or X-ray radiography.<br>
b)   Braiding :<br>
MDC (1) is passed through a tray containing room temperature curing resin and fed into the braiding machine loaded with the fibre glass yarn. The braiding is done over the wet resin, thus consolidating over the MDC. This procedure is repeated thrice. A final coat of resin is given on the above said MDC to attain the required diameter. The consolidated MDC (2) is passed through a suitable gauge to maintain uniform outer diameter (OD) and the resin is allowed to cure at room temperature for 42 to 48 hours. After complete curing of resin, three layers of fiber glass yarn braiding is further continued to end up with the required final OD as per design requirements. The braided MDC (3) is inserted into a nylon sleeve (4) of suitable diameter and thickness. One layer of SS wire is braided over the nylon sleeve (4) to get a braided MDC with 8 to 10 mm final OD. The steel braided MDC (5) is assembled with end connectors.<br><br>
c) Assembly of End Connectors for FRETL<br>
The shields of braided MDC (5) are removed from both ends for about 20 to 30 mm in length as per requirement till the consolidated MDC(2) is exposed. The connector rod (6) is inserted over this consolidated MDC (2) and fixed in position with cyanoacrylate adhesive. About 70 mg of loose booster explosive is filled into the booster cup (7). The tip of consolidated MDC (2) is cut such that it projects about 2mm above the tip of connector rod (6). Araldite (11) is applied on to the gap, if any, between the reinforcement and the face of connector rod. The body (8) is crimped on the steel braided portion of the said MDC (5), A stainless steel cap (9) is slid over the stainless steel braided MDC (5) for securing the terminal end of FRETL to the junction box. An Aluminium cup (12) of dimension 4.0 mm diameter and length 10 mm containing about 115 mg RDX based composition is assembled in the junction box. The junction box contains four protruding male thread portions (13) over which female threads of the cap (9) are fastened.<br>
PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS OF FRETL:<br>
The FRETLs thus prepared were connected to the initiating system or any intermediate system and observed for their performance. In the very large number of firings conducted, the transfer of detonation was complete from one end to another and over junction boxes through a network and no damage was observed to the covering as well as the suiTOundings. The functioning of the FRETLs was not adversely affected by the different environmental conditions like temperature ranges, -65°C to 90°C, 100% humidity, free fall rain, salt, mist etc. and were found to give full performance in all conditions. The FRETLs were tested upon a length of 12 metres and found to reliably transfer the detonation. To test the performance of these FRETLs under adverse mechanical conditions, they were flexed up to 12,000 cycles through different circular radii 80 mm. In all the trials, it was observed that the shock is transmitted over the entire length of the FRETL and the outer coverings were not damaged thus ensuring that the shock is confined with the braiding.<br>
It is to be understood that the process of the present invention is susceptible to modifications, changes and adaptations by those skilled in the art. Such modifications, changes, adaptations are intended to be within the scope of the present invention which is further set forth under the following claims:-<br><br><br><br>
