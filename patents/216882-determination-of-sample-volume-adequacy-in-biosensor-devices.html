				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The field of this invention is the electrochemical determination of analyte in<br>
biological fluids, particularly the electrochemical determination of the adequacy<br>
of the volume of the biological fluid sample to be tested for analyte<br>
concentration.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Analyte concentration determination in biological fluids, e.g., blood or blood-<br>
derived products such as plasma, is of ever increasing importance to today"s<br>
society. Such assays find use in a variety of applications and settings, including<br>
clinical laboratory testing, home testing, etc., where the results of such testing<br>
play a prominent role in the diagnosis and management of a variety of disease<br>
conditions. Common analytes of interest include glucose for diabetes<br>
management, cholesterol for monitoring cardiovascular conditions, and the like.<br>
In response to this growing importance of analyte concentration detection, a<br>
variety of analyte detection protocols and devices for both clinical and home use<br>
have been developed.<br>
One type of method that is employed for analyte detection is an electrochemical-<br>
based method. In such methods, an aqueous liquid sample is placed into a<br>
reaction zone in an electrochemical cell made up of at least two electrodes, i.e.,<br>
a counter/reference electrode and a working electrode, where the electrodes<br>
have an impedance which renders them suitable for amperometric measurement.<br>
The component to be analyzed, i.e., analyte, is allowed to react directly with an<br>
electrode, or directly or indirectly with a redox reagent to form an oxidisable (or<br>
reducible) substance in an amount corresponding to the concentration of the<br>
analyte. The quantity of the oxidisable (or reducible) substance present is then<br>
estimated electrochemically and related to the amount of analyte present in the<br>
initial sample.<br>
Commonly, the electrochemical cell is in the form of a disposable test strip on<br>
which the biological sample is deposited and which is receivable within a meter<br>
by which the electrochemical analyte concentration measurement is made.<br>
Examples of assay systems that employ these types of test strips, often referred<br>
to as biosensors, and meters may be found in U.S.Patent Nos.<br>
5,942,102,6,174,420 Bl and 6,179,979 Bl, the disclosures of which are herein<br>
incorporated by reference. With these systems, determination of the<br>
concentration of an analyte in a biological sample first involves obtaining a<br>
biological sample and bringing that sample into contact with a reaction area of<br>
the test strip so that the biological sample, and more particularly the analyte of<br>
interest or derivative thereof, may react with the chemistry, e.g., the testing<br>
reagent(s), associated with the reaction area. In order to obtain an accurate<br>
measurement of the particular analyte(s) of interest, a minimum sample volume<br>
must be applied to the reaction area. It is not uncommon for an inadequate<br>
amount of sample volume to be provided, often due to user error or patient<br>
inexperience or misjudgment. Inaccurate measurements can result in a<br>
misdiagnosis or improper treatment, such as administering an inappropriate<br>
dosage of a drug, patient non-compliance, etc. Such can result in serious and<br>
even life-threatening consequences for those whose lives depend on frequent<br>
monitoring of an analyte in their body, for example, diabetics.<br>
One approach to ensuring an adequate biological sample volume is to over-<br>
saturate or use a greater volume of sampled fluid than is necessary to fill the<br>
reaction area of the test strip. A disadvantage of using an unnecessarily large<br>
volume of a sampled fluid, a blood sample in particular, is the need to draw a<br>
greater volume of blood sample from the patient. This requires use of a blood<br>
sample volume, which is rather large, thus necessitating use of a larger diameter<br>
needle and/or deeper penetration into the skin. These factors can increase the<br>
discomfort and pain felt by the patient, and may be difficult to achieve for those<br>
individuals whose capillary blood does not readily express. As this sampling<br>
process may be repeated frequently within a single day, for many diabetics, for<br>
example, an increase in pain quickly becomes less tolerable or intolerable all<br>
together.<br>
Some analyte detection biosensors have been developed to provide visual<br>
confirmation of the adequacy of sample volume, however, this feature does not<br>
exclude potential error by the patient in judging the adequacy of the sample"s<br>
volume, e.g., diabetics may experience deteriorated vision. Certain other analyte<br>
determination biosensors do provide user-independent means for determining<br>
the adequacy of the sample volume. Examples of such biosensors are disclosed<br>
in U.S.Patent Nos. 5,628,890 and 5,650,062 and PCT Patent Application<br>
Publication No. WO 99/32881 (PCT Patent Application NO.PCT/US98/27203). In<br>
particular, the "881 publication describes an electrochemical glucose monitoring<br>
system which attempts to determine the adequacy of a volume of sample applied<br>
to a biosensor by applying a low-level AC voltage signal (without a DC voltage<br>
offset) at a known frequency to the biosensor and then measuring both the real<br>
component and the imaginary component of the resulting impedance. These<br>
impedance values are then compared to a look-up table in the microprocessor"s<br>
program memory. The accuracy of this method may be additionally questionable<br>
considering that his system is dependent on blood hematocrit levels and<br>
environmental temperature variations.<br>
Another disadvantage of the technique disclosed in the "881 publication is that<br>
the analyte measurement test must be aborted if the sample volume is<br>
determined to be inadequate, i.e., a "go-no-go" situation. This results in the<br>
need to take yet another sample from the patient which, as mentioned above, is<br>
inconvenient and may be very painful to the patient, likely resulting in patient<br>
non-compliance in his or her medication regime.<br>
Additionally, the test must be repeated resulting in the waste of test strips and<br>
increasing the cost of the procedure.<br>
As such, there is continued interest in the identification of new techniques for<br>
accurately and precisely measuring the adequacy of the volume of the sample<br>
used for electrochemical analyte concentration determination. Of particular<br>
interest would be the development of methods that can very accurately and<br>
expeditiously determine the adequacy of the volume of sample. It would be<br>
additionally beneficial to develop such a sample volume adequacy determination<br>
technique in which a determination that a sample volume is inadequate does not<br>
require abortion of the analyte concentration measurement test. Ideally, this<br>
technique would compensate for the less than optimal sample volume and<br>
provide an accurate analyte concentration measurement without having to<br>
provide a new sample or conduct a new test.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides methods and systems for measuring the volume<br>
of biological sample and determining whether such volume is adequate to<br>
produce an accurate measurement of at least one selected characteristic of the<br>
biological sample, such as the concentration of an analyte contained therein.<br>
Certain such methods and systems provide the additional function of<br>
compensating for a sample volume determined to be less than adequate in order<br>
to proceed with a measurement procedure.<br>
The present invention is employed with a biosensor, such as an electrochemical<br>
test strip to which the sample volume of biological solution is deposited, and a<br>
meter configured to receive such test strip and to measure the concentration of<br>
selected analytes within the biological sample. The electrochemical test strip, as<br>
will be more fully described below, includes an electrochemical cell comprised of<br>
opposing electrodes between which a reaction zone is defined for receiving the<br>
biological sample, wherein the reaction zone has a defined thickness and volume.<br>
When sufficient voltage is applied to an electrochemical cell, both double-layer<br>
charging and electrochemical reaction will occur. As a consequence, charge flows<br>
to the electrodes of an electrical cell. The electrode-solution interface is<br>
analogous to that of a capacitor. The ratio of this charge to the voltage<br>
determines the capacitance of the electrode solution interface. Since the total<br>
charge is due to the charging of the double layer and to the electrochemical<br>
reaction, two distinct capacitance components, Cdl and Cs, respectively,<br>
contribute to the total or equivalent capacitance of the cell (see Bard, A.J. and<br>
Faulkner, L.R., Electrochemical Methods, 1980).<br>
The inventors have discovered that the equivalent capacitance of an<br>
electrochemical cell is the most relevant factor in precisely determining sample<br>
volume, as the equivalent cell capacitance is linearly proportional to the amount<br>
of surface area of the cell electrodes in contact with the sample (the "covered<br>
cell area"), and thus, is linearly proportional to the volume of the sample within<br>
the cell, i.e., between the electrodes. The inventors have also discovered that<br>
the equivalent resistance of the electrochemical cell is additionally relevant in<br>
precisely determining sample volume, as the equivalent cell resistance is<br>
inversely proportional to the covered cell area, and thus, is inversely proportional<br>
to the sample volume.<br>
Thus, a feature of the present invention is to derive such covered cell area and<br>
the corresponding sample volume from the equivalent cell capacitance or from<br>
both the equivalent cell capacitance and the equivalent cell resistance.<br>
Another feature of the present invention is to control certain other factors (e.g.,<br>
the thickness of the cell, the concentration of ionic species, etc.) that may<br>
interfere with accurately measuring sample volume in order that the value of the<br>
equivalent cell capacitance is independent and unaffected by the glucose<br>
concentration and blood hematocrit levels within the sample, the environmental<br>
temperature, particularities of the blood donor and other commonly interfering<br>
components of blood.<br>
Yet another feature of the present invention is to provide the additional function<br>
of compensating for a sample volume determined to be less than adequate in<br>
order to proceed with an accurate analyte concentration measurement.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides methods for determining the<br>
adequacy of the volume of a biological sample to be used for determining he<br>
concentration of one or more selected analytes within the donor sample, which<br>
achieves these objectives and provides these features.<br>
In certain embodiments of the subject methods, an alternating current voltage<br>
(AC voltage) of low amplitude and having a selected frequency is applied to a<br>
biosensor containing the biological sample to be tested, thereby charging the<br>
biosensor. Optionally, a direct current voltage (DC voltage) may be applied<br>
simultaneously along with the AC voltage in order to increase the rate at which<br>
the capacitance of the biosensor becomes stabilized. The resulting alternating<br>
current generated from such charging is then measured, and the equivalent cell<br>
capacitance of the biosensor is then determined from the resulting alternating<br>
current. The equivalent cell capacitance is then used to determine the amount of<br>
surface area of the biosensor in contact with the sample solution, which surface<br>
area is then used to derive the volume of the sample within the biosensor. Upon<br>
a determination that the sample volume is adequate to make an accurate analyte<br>
concentration measurement, such analyte concentration is measured. On the<br>
other hand, if it is determined that the sample volume is inadequate, the subject<br>
methods may further include compensating for such inadequate sample volume<br>
during the analyte concentration measurement process.<br>
Inadequate volume compensation involves determining the necessary<br>
compensation factor which includes, at least in part, determining the ratio of the<br>
equivalent cell capacitance of the biosensor containing the actual sample volume<br>
to the cell capacitance of the biosensor when its entire available volume is filled.<br>
The present invention also includes systems for carrying out the subject<br>
methods. The subject systems include electronic components and/or circuitry<br>
intended to be used with and electronically coupled to a biosensor, e.g., an<br>
electrochemical measurement cell in the form of, e.g., a disposable test strip,<br>
into which the sampled solution to be tested is deposited or is drawn by a<br>
capillary action. Most typically, such electronic circuitry is incorporated into a<br>
meter or other automated device configured to receive and operatively engage<br>
with such electrochemical cell, e.g., a disposable test strip, and to measure one<br>
or more physical or chemical characteristics of a biological sample held within the<br>
electrochemical cell. Most typically, such characteristics include the concentration<br>
of one or more target analytes within the biological sample. Such electronic<br>
circuitry may comprise discrete electronic components, e.g., a voltage supply,<br>
and/or integrated circuits having multiple circuit elements and/or semiconductor<br>
devices, e.g., a microprocessor suitably programmed to execute certain steps or<br>
functions of the subject methods based on certain signal or data inputs received<br>
from the electrochemical cell.<br>
In certain embodiments, the systems of the present invention include such<br>
electronic circuitry and such an automated measurement device or meter, as just<br>
described, wherein the electronic circuitry is completely structurally and<br>
functionally integral with the automated measurement device.<br>
While the subject methods and systems may be used to determine the sample<br>
volume of different biological samples, such as urine, tears, saliva, and the like,<br>
they are particularly suited for use in determining the sample volume of blood or<br>
blood fractions and the like. Furthermore, while the subject systems and<br>
methods for determining the sample volume in preparation for measuring a<br>
variety of physical and chemical characteristics of the sample, they are<br>
particularly useful in preparation for measuring the concentration of selected<br>
analytes within the sample.<br>
These and other objects, advantages, and features of the invention will become<br>
apparent to those persons skilled in the art upon reading the details of the<br>
methods and systems of the present invention which are more fully described<br>
below.<br>

ELECTROCHEMICAL BIOSENSORS<br>
As summarized above, the invention provides methods and systems for<br>
measuring the volume of a sample of biological material used for analyte<br>
concentration measurement and determining whether such volume is adequate<br>
to produce an accurate analyte concentration measurement. These methods and<br>
systems are usable with a biosensor, more particularly an electrochemical cell-<br>
based biosensor, into which the sampled biological material is deposited or<br>
transferred. There are varying designs of electrochemical cell-based biosensors.<br>
The most common of these designs employed in the field of analyte<br>
concentration monitoring include test strip configurations, such as those<br>
disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,193,873 and in copending U.S.Patent Application<br>
Serial Nos. 09/497,304, 09/497,269, 09/736,788 and 09/746,116, the disclosures<br>
of which are herein incorporated by reference. Such test strips are used with<br>
meters configured for electrochemical measurements, such as those disclosed in<br>
the above-identified patent references.<br>
Electrochemical biosensors other than test strips may also be suitable for use<br>
with the present invention. For example, the electrochemical cell may have a<br>
cylindrical configuration wherein a core electrode is co-axially positioned within a<br>
second tubular electrode. Such electrochemical cell configurations may be in the<br>
form of micro-needles and, as such, are either integral within the needle<br>
structure for in situ (e.g., typically under the skin surface) measurements or<br>
otherwise in physical or fluid communication with a micro-needle structure.<br>
Examples of such micro-needle are disclosed in copending U.S. Patent<br>
Application Serial Nos. 09/878,742 and 09/879,106 filed on June 12,2001, hereby<br>
incorporated by reference. For purposes of this disclosure, the subject devices<br>
will be described in use with electrochemical cells in test strip configurations;<br>
however, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the subject devices may be<br>
used with any suitable electrochemical cell configuration, including micro-needle<br>
configurations.<br>
The type of electrochemical measurement that is made may vary depending on<br>
the particular nature of the assay and the meter with which the electrochemical<br>
test strip is employed, e.g., depending on whether the assay is coulometric,<br>
amperometric or potentiometric. The electrochemical cell will measure charge in<br>
a coulometric assay, current in an amperometric assay and potential in a<br>
potentiometric assay. For purposes of this disclosure, the present invention will<br>
be described in the context of amperometric assays; however, the subject<br>
devices may be employed with any type of assay and electrochemical<br>
measurement.<br>
Generally, in any configuration, an electrochemical cell includes at least two<br>
electrodes spaced-apart in either a facing arrangement or in a side-by-side<br>
arrangement in the same plane. In the first arrangement, the electrodes are<br>
separated by a thin spacer layer, which defines a reaction area or zone, or<br>
chamber into which a biological sample is deposited or transferred for analyte<br>
concentration measurement. In the side-by-side configuration, the electrodes are<br>
in a chamber with a defined thickness and volume. Present in the reaction area<br>
or chamber, i.e., coated on one or more of the facing surfaces of the electrodes,<br>
are one or more redox reagents selected to chemically react the target<br>
analyte(s). Such redox reagents typically comprise at least one enzyme and a<br>
mediator.<br>
A representation of an exemplary conventional electrochemical test strip 2<br>
suitable for use with the present invention is provided in the exploded view of<br>
Fig.l. Test strip 2 is made up of a two electrodes 4,8 separated by a spacer layer<br>
12 which has a cutaway section that defines the reaction zone or area 14.<br>
Generally, the electrodes 4,8 are configured in the form of elongated rectangular<br>
strips each having a length in the range from about 2 to 6 cm, usually from<br>
about 3 to 4 cm, having a width in the range from about 0.3 to 1.0 cm, usually<br>
from about 0.5 to 0.7 cm, and having a thickness in the range from about 0.2 to<br>
1.2 mm, and usually from 0.38 to 0.64 mm.<br>
The surfaces of electrodes 4,8 that face the reaction area in the strip is made of<br>
a conductive material, preferably a metal, where metals of interest include<br>
palladium, gold, platinum, iridium, doped indium tin oxide, stainless steel, carbon<br>
and the like. The outside surfaces 6,10 of electrodes 4,8 are made of an inert<br>
support or backing material. Any suitable inert backing material may be used<br>
with electrodes 4,8, where typically the material is a rigid material that is capable<br>
of providing structural support to the electrode and, in turn, the electrochemical<br>
test strip as a whole. Such suitable materials include plastics, e.g., PET, PETG,<br>
polyimide, polycarbonate, polystyrene, silicon, ceramic, glass, and the like.<br>
Electrodes 4,8 and test strip 2 may be fabricated using any of various<br>
manufacturing techniques known to those skilled in the relevant art.<br>
As described above, a thin spacer layer 12 is positioned or sandwiched between<br>
electrodes 4,8. The thickness of spacer layer 12 generally ranges from about 1 to<br>
500 urn, and usually from about 50 to 150 urn. Spacer layer 12 may be<br>
fabricated from any convenient material, where representative suitable materials<br>
include PET, PETG, polyimide, polycarbonate and the like. The surfaces of spacer<br>
layer 12 may be treated so as to be adhesive with respective electrodes 4,8 and<br>
thereby maintain the structure of the electrochemical test strip 2.<br>
Spacer layer 12 is cut so as to provide a reaction zone or area 14 having any<br>
appropriate shape including circular, square, triangular, rectangular, or irregular<br>
shaped reaction areas. The top and bottom of the reaction zone 14 is defined by<br>
the facing surfaces of electrodes 4,8 while spacer layer 12 defines the side walls<br>
of the reaction area 14. The volume of the reaction area ranges from at least<br>
about 0.1 to 10 µl, usually from about 0.2 to 5.0µL and more usually from about<br>
0.3 to 1.6 µL<br>
Present in the reaction area 14 is a redox reagent system, which reagent system<br>
provides for the species that is detected by the electrode and therefore is used<br>
to derive the concentration of analyte in a biological sample. The redox reagent<br>
system present in the reaction area typically includes at least an enzyme (s) and<br>
a mediator. In many embodiments, the enzyme member(s) of the redox reagent<br>
system is an enzyme or plurality of enzymes that work in concert to oxidize the<br>
analyte of interest. In other words, the enzyme component of the redox reagent<br>
system is made up of a single analyte oxidizing enzyme or a collection of two or<br>
more enzymes that work in concert to oxidize the analyte of interest. Typical<br>
enzymes of interest include oxidoreductases, hydrolases, transferases and the<br>
like; however, the specific enzyme present in the reaction area depends on the<br>
particular analyte for which the electrochemical test strip is designed to detect.<br>
Where the analyte of interest is glucose, for example, suitable enzymes include<br>
glucose oxidase, glucose dehydrogenase (eitherp- nicotineamide adennine<br>
dinucleotide based (NAD) or 4,5-Dihydro-4, 5-dioxo-lH-pynolo[2,3-f] quinoline-<br>
2,7,9-tricarboxylic acid based (PQQ)). Where the analyte is cholesterol, suitable<br>
enzymes include cholesterol esterase and cholesterol oxidaso. For other analytes,<br>
enzymes including but not limited to lipoprotein lipase, glycerol kinase, glycerol-<br>
3-phosphate oxidase, lactate oxidase, lactate dehydrogenase, pyruvate oxidase,<br>
alcohol oxidase, bilirubin oxidase, uricase, and the like may be used.<br>
The second component of the redox reagent system is a mediator component,<br>
which is made up of one or more mediator agents. A variety of different<br>
mediator agents are known in the art and include: ferricyanide, phenazine<br>
ethosulphate, phenazine methosulfate, pheylenediamine, 1-methoxy-phenazine<br>
methosulfate, 2,6-dimethyl-1, 4-benzoquinone, 2,5-dichloro-l, 4-benzoquinone,<br>
ferrocene derivatives, osmium bipyridyl complexes, ruthemum complexes and the<br>
like. In those embodiments where glucose is the analyte of interest and glucose<br>
oxidase or glucose dehydrogenase is the enzyme components, mediator of<br>
particular interest is ferricyanide. Other reagents that may be present in the<br>
reaction area include buffering agents, e.g., citraconate, citrate, phosphate,<br>
"Good" buffers and the like .<br>
The redox reagent system is generally present in dry form. The amounts of the<br>
various components may vary, where the amount of enzyme component typically<br>
ranges from about 0.1 to 20% by weight.<br>
METHODS OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
As summarized above, the subject invention includes methods for determining<br>
the volume of biological sample deposited or transferred to an electrochemical<br>
cell having a reaction zone or chamber with a defined volume and determining<br>
whether such volume is adequate to produce an accurate analyte concentration<br>
measurement. As mentioned above, a feature of the subject methods in<br>
determining sample volume is the determination of the equivalent capacitance of<br>
the cell, as well as the equivalent cell resistance. As such, the subject methods<br>
provide a more accurate of sample volume than that which has been achieved by<br>
the prior art.<br>
Another feature of the subject methods in determining the equivalent cell<br>
capacitance and resistance and sample volume is to disregard certain<br>
characteristics or factors of the sampled solution or ambient conditions which<br>
either have no affect on the determination of the equivalent capacitance and/or<br>
equivalent resistance or arc otherwise strictly controlled so as not to have such<br>
an affect. Such factors which are controlled or independent of the equivalent<br>
capacitance include but are not limited to the concentration of ionic species,<br>
blood hematocrit, blood glucose concentration, environmental temperature, the<br>
blood donor, and sensor interferences typically found in blood, cell thickness and<br>
biosensor aging.<br>
For purpose of understanding the description of the subject methods, a<br>
simplified model of an impedance circuit 40 of the electrochemical cell of the test<br>
strip of Fig. 1 is provided in Fig. 2. Impedance circuit 40 is representative of the<br>
impedance factors of the test strip when containing a sample of biological<br>
solution and having a voltage applied to it. When both AC and DC voltages are<br>
applied to the cell, impedance circuit 40 comprises equivalent cell capacitance ( C<br>
) 42, which includes the double layer and the Faradaic capacitances, and the<br>
equivalent cell resistance ( R) 46 of the electrochemical cell.<br>
Prior to practicing the subject methods, it is first necessary to obtain the<br>
biological sample to be measured and placing such sample within the test strip<br>
cell. Placement of the sample within the test strip may be accomplished by first<br>
inserting the test strip into the test meter and then applying the sample to the<br>
test strip ("on-meter dosing"), or by first applying the sample to the test strip<br>
and then inserting the test strip into the test meter ("off-meter dosing"). The<br>
latter sequence is often preferred in hospital environments as it is more likely to<br>
cross-contamination within the meter. The measurement meter then detects that<br>
the biological sample has been introduced into the electrochemical cell (as<br>
disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,193,873).<br>
Once such sample is detected, the first step of the subject methods is to apply<br>
an alternating voltage (VAc) of low amplitude to the biosensor. The amplitude of<br>
the applied AC voltage is selected such that its application does not result in a<br>
Faradaic current (iF), i.e., the electron transfer that occurs at the electrode<br>
surface as result of electrochemical reaction upon application of a voltage to the<br>
electrode. As such, the amplitude of the applied AC voltage is in the range from<br>
about 2 to 100 mV rms, typically is in the range from about 5 to 75 mV rms, and<br>
more typically is about 50 mV rms. The frequency (0 of the applied AC voltage is<br>
also selected so as to maximize the signal to noise ration (i.e., the ratio of the<br>
measured equivalent cell capacitance to the variability in the measured<br>
equivalent cell capacitance) of the cell. As such, an acceptable frequency of the<br>
applied AC voltage is in the range from about 50 to 10,000 Hz, typically in the<br>
range from about 75 to 1,000 Hz, and more typically is about 100 Hz.<br>
Optionally, a DC voltage may be applied to the biosensor, either simultaneously<br>
with the AC voltage or fractions of a second prior to application of the AC<br>
voltage. This DC voltage is generally in the range from about 0 to 600 mV,<br>
typically from about 200 to 500 mV and more typically from 300 to 400 mV. The<br>
DC voltage component causes the electrochemical cell equivalent capacitance to<br>
stabilize more rapidly than it would with an AC voltage alone. The rapid<br>
stabilization of the cell capacitance allows a determination of the sample volume<br>
before commencing the analyte measurement, thus minimizing overall testing<br>
time.<br>
After application of the AC and DC voltages, the alternating current (iAc)<br>
generated from charging the electrochemical cell is then measured. The<br>
equivalent cell capacitance of the biosensor can then be determined from the<br>
amplitude and the phase of the resulting alternating current.<br>
For the equivalent cell capacitance to depend only on the cell surface area<br>
contacted by biological sample, the charge separation distance (ddl) of the<br>
double layer capacitance must be strictly controlled such that its constant during<br>
the determination of the volume of the sample solution. The thickness of the<br>
double layer capacitor is dependent on the applied voltage, concentrations of the<br>
charged species in the solution. In order to ensure a constant thickness of the<br>
charge separation layer, and thus ensure an accurate determination of the<br>
surface area of each electrode in contact with the sample solution and an<br>
accurate determination of the sample volume, the ion concentration of the redox<br>
reagent is strictly controlled, while the ion concentration of the sample is<br>
physiologically controlled in a very narrow range.<br>
As mentioned above, the equivalent resistance of the electrochemical cell is<br>
additionally relevant to accurately determining sample volume. Thus, establishing<br>
that the equivalent cell resistance ( R ) is inversely proportional to the surface<br>
area of the cell covered by the sample and that the equivalent cell<br>
capacitance(C) is linearly proportional to the covered cell area, as represented by<br>
the following relationships:<br>
R= ?l/A and C ? A<br>
where ? is the resistivity of the electrochemical cell, I is the length of the cell<br>
electrode, and A is the conducting surface area of the cell, the following<br>
relationship exists:<br>
C/R ? A2<br>
Thus, the amount of surface area of the cell covered by the biological sample<br>
can be determined by the ratio of the equivalent cell capacitance to the<br>
equivalent cell resistance. By taking into consideration the effect of sample<br>
volume on two impedance components (capacitance and resistance) of the cell<br>
rather than just on one of them (e.g., capacitance), a relationship is established<br>
which offers more sensitivity in response to the variations in the amount of cell<br>
surface area covered by a biological sample. More specifically, the ratio of the<br>
cell capacitance to cell resistance provides a quadratic relationship rather than a<br>
linear relationship with respect to the surface area of the cell covered by a<br>
biological sample, thus increasing the sensitivity in the measured change(s) to<br>
the covered cell area. Therefore, the determination of the covered cell area<br>
according to this method is even more accurate than when only the equivalent<br>
cell capacitance is considered.<br>
Upon a determination of the surface area of the electrode in contact with or<br>
covered by the sample solution, the volume (Vs) of the sample solution within<br>
the biosensor, i.e., within the reaction zone of the electrochemical cell, can then<br>
be determined according to the following equation:<br>
Vs = A • d<br>
where d is the distance between the cell electrodes in a facing electrode<br>
configuration or the depth of the cell in a side-to-side electrode configuration.<br>
A determination is then made as to whether the volume of the sample provided<br>
to the test strip is adequate to proceed with the analyte concentration<br>
measurement. Such a determination is made by comparing the calculated sample<br>
volume with the total volume of the electrochemical cell. As is discussed in more<br>
detail below with respect to the systems of the present invention, certain<br>
parameters including but not limited to the value of the total cell volume,<br>
operating temperature range, proper test strip insertion into the meter, among<br>
other data (both static and dynamic) or parameters related to the particular cell,<br>
are stored in the memory of a microprocessor, for example, upon calibration of<br>
the meter and other related components of the subject systems.<br>
If the sample volume is determined to be adequate, measurement of the desired<br>
characteristic, e.g., an analyte concentration, is made, the results of which may<br>
be displayed on a display unit, described in more detail below with respect to the<br>
subject systems. On the other hand, if the sample volume is determined to be<br>
inadequate, i.e., too low, to provide an accurate measurement, the display unit<br>
may be configured to display a low volume icon.<br>
As discussed above, certain embodiments of the subject methods include the<br>
additional function of compensating for an inadequate sample solution volume in<br>
order to make an accurate measurement of the selected characteristic, e.g.,<br>
concentration of the targeted analyte(s), without having to redo the sampling<br>
and testing steps.<br>
It is known in the art that the concentration of a selected analyte, such as<br>
glucose, of the biological sample within the cell is proportional to the Faradaic<br>
current (IF) that is passed through the electrochemical cell when a DC voltage is<br>
applied, that the cell current is proportional to the cell surface area covered by<br>
the sample solution. As mentioned above, the inventors have determined that<br>
such surface area is proportional to the equivalent capacitance of the cell. Thus,<br>
the concentration of the selected analyte is proportional to the equivalent cell<br>
capacitance. By determining the equivalent cell capacitance when a sample<br>
solution is present and by knowing the capacitance of the cell when completely<br>
filled with a biological solution(determined by a calibration process), the<br>
compensation factor (Fcf) necessary to compensate for a low sample volume and<br>
to provide an accurate analyte concentration measurement can be determined<br>
according to the following equation:<br>
Fcf = Cf / Cpf<br>
where Cf is the equivalent capacitance of the completely filled electrochemical<br>
cell and Cpf is the equivalent capacitance of the electrochemical cell containing<br>
the inadequate volume of biological sample. The corrected analyte concentration<br>
measurement (G) is then made with the appropriate compensation factor (FCf)<br>
according to the following equation:<br>
G = Fcf • GPf<br>
where Gpf is the analyte concentration calculated from the cell containing<br>
inadequate volume of biological sample. In being able to compensate for<br>
inadequately low sample volume, the subject methods avoid wasting test strips,<br>
decrease costs and reduce the time necessary for conducting the analyte<br>
measurement.<br>
Thus, generally summarized in accordance with the above principles and<br>
discoveries, certain methods of the present invention include the steps of<br>
applying an AC voltage having a selected amplitude and a selected frequency to<br>
the biosensor with or without also applying a DC voltage to the biosensor;<br>
measuring the AC current generated by application of the voltage(s);<br>
determining the capacitance or both the capacitance and the resistance of the<br>
biosensor from the measured AC current; determining the surface area of the<br>
portion of the biosensor in contact with the sample based on the determined<br>
capacitance or based on both the determined capacitance and the determined<br>
resistance; and then determining the volume of the sample within the biosensor<br>
based on the determined surface area.<br>
Other subject methods further include the step of measuring one or more<br>
physical or chemical characteristics of the biological sample, such as the<br>
concentration of one or more selected analytes, based on a determination that<br>
the sample volume is adequate. Still other subject methods include<br>
compensating for an inadequate volume of a biological sample held within an<br>
electrochemical biosensor for measurement of at least one characteristic of the<br>
biological sample in order to accurately measure the value of the characteristic.<br>
Such compensation method includes determining the necessary compensation<br>
factor to compensate for an inadequate sample volume if such is determined,<br>
and thereafter compensating for the inadequate sample volume while measuring,<br>
for example, the concentration of a selected analyte present within the sample.<br>
The step of determining the necessary compensation factor includes determining<br>
the ratio of the equivalent capacitance of the biosensor when completely filled<br>
with the sample to the determined equivalent capacitance of the biosensor with<br>
the inadequate sample volume. The value of the equivalent capacitance of the<br>
biosensor when completely filled within said sample may be accessed from a<br>
memory storage means.<br>
SYSTEMS OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
The present invention also provides systems for practicing the above-described<br>
subject methods. Generally described, such a system may include the following<br>
components for carrying out the steps of the above-described methods of the<br>
present invention: a voltage supply configured for applying a voltage to the<br>
electrochemical cell, means for measuring a current generated by the cell when<br>
the voltage is applied to the cell, means for deriving the capacitance and/or<br>
resistance of the cell from the measured current; means for deriving the surface<br>
area of the cell covered by the biological sample from the cell capacitance and/or<br>
resistance; and means for deriving the volume of the biological sample from the<br>
cell surface area. Certain systems further include means for determining whether<br>
the sample volume is adequate for making an accurate measurement of one or<br>
more selected characteristics of the biological sample, including but not limited to<br>
the concentration of one or more selected analytes within the biological sample.<br>
Certain of these systems further include means for compensating for an<br>
inadequate sample volume while the selected characteristic of the biological<br>
sample.<br>
Fig.3 illustrates a block diagram of an exemplary system 50 of the present<br>
invention. System 50 includes electronic components and circuitry configured to<br>
be electronically coupled to a biosensor 70, e.g., an electrochemical<br>
measurement cell in the form of a disposable test strip as described above with<br>
respect to Fig. 1, into which the sampled biological solution to be tested is<br>
deposited or transferred. More particularly, system 50 includes a voltage supply<br>
52 for supplying the requisite AC and DC input voltages to biosensor 70. System<br>
50 further includes a current-to-voltage converter 54, and analog to digital<br>
converter 56 and a microprocessor 58, which collectively act to receive and<br>
process data from biosensor 70. In particular, current-to-voltage converter 54 is<br>
operatively coupled to an output terminal of biosensor 70 for receiving the<br>
output current signal from biosensor 70 when a voltage is applied by voltage<br>
supply 52 and for converting that current signal to a corresponding voltage<br>
signal. This corresponding voltage signal is then provided as an input to analog-<br>
to-digital converter 56 which converts the analog voltage signal to a<br>
corresponding digital value. This digital voltage value is then provided as an<br>
input signal to microprocessor 54 which is programmed to derive and/or<br>
determine the factors or parameters of interest,e.g., equivalent cell capacitance,<br>
equivalent cell resistance, the surface area of the biosensor in contact with the<br>
biosensor, the volume of the biological sample, the volume compensation factor,<br>
etc.; and to control the timing of each of these functions. As previously<br>
mentioned, microprocessor 54 may include a memory storage means for storing<br>
predetermined, preselected or calibrated data or information such as the total<br>
volume of the electrochemical cell, calibration parameters, operating temperature<br>
range, sample type information, sample detection information and the like which<br>
are necessary or useful for performing the steps and functions of the subject<br>
methods. Although a microprocessor has been described for purposes of storing<br>
and processing data in accordance with the principles of the present invention,<br>
those skilled in the art will recognize that other discrete electronic components<br>
may be collectively configured to achieve the objectives of the present invention.<br>
The subject system may further include a display device or unit 60 for displaying<br>
selected empirical or symbolic data, information or outputs supplied by the<br>
control device or microprocessor. Such data, information or outputs may include,<br>
but are not limited to, measured or derived values of selected output signals and<br>
impedance factors, sample volume size, volume adequacy/inadequacy indicator<br>
icons, inadequate volume compensation factors, concentrations of analytes of<br>
interest, biological sample versus control sample indicator icons, calibration<br>
results, etc.<br>
In many embodiments, the electrochemical signal application, measurement,<br>
derivation, calculation, compensation and display steps, as described above, are<br>
performed automatically by the subject systems designed to work with the<br>
electrochemical cell. As such, the electronic circuitry of the subject systems may<br>
be structurally and functionally integrated into a meter or other automated<br>
device configured to receive and operatively engage with an electrochemical cell,<br>
e.g., a disposable test strip, and to measure one or more physical or chemical<br>
characteristics of a biological sample held within the electrochemical cell. Most<br>
typically, such characteristics include the concentration of one or more target<br>
analytes within the biological sample. A representative meter or device for<br>
automatically practicing some of the same or similar steps and functions, such<br>
that the user need only apply a biological sample to the reaction zone of an<br>
electrochemical cell and then read the final analyte concentration result from the<br>
device, is further described in U.S. Patent No. 6,193,873 Bl, the disclosure of<br>
which is herein incorporated by reference.<br>
Those skilled in the relevant art will appreciate that the subject systems are<br>
usable with assay systems that do not comprise biosensors of the type described<br>
above. Such other systems include for example, an electrochemical cell having at<br>
least two electrodes and a redox reagent system having a fixed concentration of<br>
ions, wherein the electrodes are configured to be placed within a biological<br>
sample or environment having a fixed concentration of ions.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
The following results have been observed in connection with the present<br>
invention<br>
Figs. 4-8 illustrate the variation in the experimental results of measurements<br>
made of test strips having an adequate sample volume (i.e., test strips having<br>
reaction zones completely filled with sample solution or material) and of test<br>
strips having less than an adequate sample volume (i.e., test strips having<br>
reaction zones half filled with sample solution or material). More particularly,<br>
measurements of the equivalent capacitance of the electrochemical cells and the<br>
sample solution resistance were made over selected periods of time during which<br>
the appropriate voltages were applied to the test strips. The following<br>
experimental results are offered by way of illustration and not by way of<br>
limitation. The results illustrated were collected by dosing the strips with 5<br>
different blood donors, glucose range of 40-600 mg/dL, hematocrit of 20% and<br>
70%, at room temperature .<br>
Fig.4 illustrates a comparison of the change in the equivalent cell capacitance (y-<br>
axis) over time (x-axis) of test strips 130 completely filled with blood samples<br>
and test strips 132 half-filled with blood samples. The graph shows that the<br>
completely filled test strips 130 produced an equivalent cell capacitance twice as<br>
great as the equivalent capacitance of the half-filled test strips 132.<br>
Fig. 5 illustrates a comparison in the change in the equivalent cell resistance (y-<br>
axis) over time (x-axis) in test strips 136 completely filled with the blood samples<br>
and test strips 134 half-filled with the blood samples. The graph shows that the<br>
greater volume of blood sample produced an equivalent cell resistance about one<br>
half of that of the test strips filled with the smaller volume of blood sample.<br>
Fig. 6 illustrates histograms of the equivalent cell capacitance (x-axis) of test<br>
strips 140 completely filled with blood samples and test strips 138 half-filled with<br>
blood samples, wherein the equivalent cell capacitance is measured at 0.5<br>
seconds after blood sample is applied to the test strip. The graph shows that the<br>
completely filled test strips 140 produced an equivalent cell capacitance twice as<br>
great as the equivalent capacitance of the half-filled test strips 138 with a very<br>
good reproducibility.<br>
Fig. 7 illustrates a comparison of the change in the ratio of the equivalent cell<br>
capacitance to the equivalent cell resistance (C/R) (y-axis) over time (x-axis) of<br>
test strips 142 completely filled with blood samples and test strips 144 half-filled<br>
with blood samples. The graph shows that the completely filled test strips 142<br>
produced a C/R about four times as great as the C/R of the half-filled test strips<br>
144.<br>
Fig. 8 illustrates a comparison of a scatter diagram of the ratio of the equivalent<br>
cell capacitance to the equivalent cell resistance (C/R) (y-axis) versus the<br>
equivalent cell capacitance (x-axis) of test strips 146 completely filled with blood<br>
samples and test strips 148 half-filled with blood samples, wherein the<br>
capacitance and the resistance are measured at 0.5 seconds after application the<br>
blood sample to the test strip. The graph shows that C/R produced more<br>
sensitivity to the sample volume compared to the equivalent cell capacitance C.<br>
KITS<br>
Also provided by the subject invention are kits for use in practicing the subject<br>
methods. The kits of the subject invention include a subject system including the<br>
electronic circuitry, as described above, or in the form of a meter or other<br>
automated instrument, as described above, for determining whether the volume<br>
of sample applied to a test strip is adequate enough to provide an accurate<br>
analyte concentration measurement to be made. In certain other kits, the<br>
subject systems also compensate for such inadequate volume when making an<br>
analyte concentration measurement. The kits may further include instructions for<br>
using the subject systems according to the subject methods with an<br>
electrochemical cell, in the form of a test strip or micro-needle or the like, in the<br>
determination of the volume of a sampled solution or material held within the<br>
electrochemical cell. These instructions may be present on one or more of the<br>
packaging, a label insert, and the like.<br>
It is evident from the above description that the features of the subject methods<br>
and systems overcome many of the disadvantages of prior art techniques for<br>
determining the volume of a biological sample deposited on a test strip for<br>
electrochemical analyte concentration analysis, and provide certain advantages<br>
including, but not limited to, providing a very accurate means and technique for<br>
making such sample volume determination and decreasing the time necessary to<br>
conduct analyte concentration measurements. Further, such sample volume<br>
determination is not subject to variations of blood glucose concentration, blood<br>
hematocrit level, the blood donor, testing temperature, and the concentration of<br>
interferences often present in blood samples. Other advantages of the invention<br>
include the ability to compensate for an inadequate sample volume and proceed<br>
with the analyte concentration measurement without having to abort the testing<br>
procedure, minimizing waste and costs. As such, the subject invention represents<br>
a significant contribution to the field of fluid of biological sample volume<br>
determination and analyte concentration measurement.<br>
