				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION <br>
THe present invention provides novel-pharmaceuticals useful for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, methods of imaging tumors in a patient, and methods of treating cancer in a patient. The invention is also directed to novel pharmaceutical compositions and combination therapy comprising a compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and at least one agent selected from the group consisting of an anti-cancer agent and a radiosensitizer agent. In addition, the invention is directed to novel pharmaceutical compositions and combination therapy comprising a compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and a photosensitizing agent. The pharmaceuticals are comprised of a targeting moiety that binds to the vitronectin receptor that is expressed in tumor vasculature, an optional linking group, and a therapeutically effective radioisotope or diagnostically effective imageable moiety. The therapeutically effective radioisotope emits a gamma ray or alpha particle sufficient to be cytotoxic.  The imageable moiety is a gamma ray or positron emitting radioisotope, a magnetic resonance imaging contrast agent, an X-ray contrast agent, or an ultrasound contrast agent.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Cancer is a major public health concern in the United States and around the world.  It is estimated<br>
that over 1 million new cases of invasive cancer will be diagnosed in the United States in 1998.  The most prevalent forms of the disease are solid tumors of the lung, breast, prostate, colon and rectum.  Cancer is typically diagnosed by a combination of in vitro tests and imaging procedures.  The imaging procedures include X-ray computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound imaging and radionuclide scintigraphy. Frequently, a contrast agent is administered to the patient to enhance the image obtained by X-ray CT, MRI and ultrasound, and the administration of a radiopharmaceutical that locAL1zes in tumors is required for radionuclide scintigraphy.<br>
Treatment of cancer typically involves the use of external beam radiation therapy and chemotherapy, either alone or in combination, depending on the type and extent of the disease.  A number of chemotherapeutic agents are available, but generally they all suffer from a lack of specificity for tumors versus normal tissues, resulting in considerable side-effects.  The effectiveness of these treatment modAL1ties is also limited, as evidenced by the high mortAL1ty rates for a number of cancer types, especially the more prevalent solid tumor diseases.  More effective and specific treatment means continue to be needed.<br>
Despite the variety of imaging procedures available for the diagnosis of cancer, there remains a need for improved methods.  In particular, methods that can better differentiate between cancer and other pathologic conditions or benign physiologic abnormAL1ties are needed.  One means of achieving this desired improvement would be to administer to the patient a<br>
metallopharmaceutical that locAL1zes specifically in the tumor by binding to a receptor expressed only in tumors<br>
or expressed to a significantly greater extent in tumors than in other tissue.  The location of the metallopharmaceutical could then be detected externally either by its imageable emission in the case of certain radiopharmaceuticals or by its effect on the relaxation rate of water in the immediate vicinity in the case of magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents.<br>
This tumor specific metallopharmaceutical approach can also be used for the treatment of cancer when the metallopharmaceutical is comprised of a particle emitting radioisotope.  The radioactive decay of the isotope at the site of the tumor results in sufficient ionizing radiation to be toxic to the tumor cells.  The specificity of this approach for tumors minimizes the amount of normal tissue that is exposed to the cytotoxic agent and thus may provide more effective treatment with fewer side-effects.<br>
Previous efforts to achieve these desired improvements in cancer imaging and treatment have centered on the use of radionuclide labeled monoclonal antibodies, antibody fragments and other proteins or polypeptides that bind to tumor cell surface receptors. The specificity of these radiopharmaceuticals is frequently very high, but they suffer from several disadvantages.  First, because of their high molecular weight, they are generally cleared from the blood stream very slowly, resulting in a prolonged blood background in the images.  Also, due to their molecular weight they do not extravasate readily at the site of the tumor and then only slowly diffuse through the extravascular space to the tumor cell surface.  This results in a very limited amount of the radiopharmaceutical reaching the receptors and thus very low signal intensity in imaging and insufficient cytotoxic effect for treatment.<br>
Alternative approaches to cancer imaging and therapy have involved the use of small molecules, such as peptides, that bind to tumor cell surface receptors. An In-Ill labeled somatostatin receptor binding peptide, In-lll-DTPA-D-Phe1-octeotide, is in clinical use in many countries for imaging tumors that express the somatostatin receptor (Baker, et al. Life Sci., 1991, 49, 1583-91 and Krenning, et al., Eur. J. Nucl. Med., 1993, 20, 716-31). Higher doses of this<br>
radiopharmaceutical have been investigated for potential treatment of these types of cancer (Krenning, et al., Digestion, 1996, 57, 57-61). Several groups are investigating the use of Tc-99m labeled ananlogs of In-lll-DTPA-D-Phe1-octeotide for imaging and Re-186 labeled analogs for therapy (Flanagan, et al., U.S. 5,556,939, Lyle, et al., U.S. 5,3 82,654, and Albert et al.,U.S. 5,650,134).<br>
Angiogenesis is the process by which new blood vessels are formed from pre-existing capillaries or post capillary venules; it is an important component of a variety of physiological processes including ovulation, embryonic development, wound repair, and collateral vascular generation in the myocardium.  It is also central to a number of pathological conditions such as tumor growth and metastasis, diabetic retinopathy, and macular degeneration.  The process begins with the activation of existing vascular endothelial cells in response to a variety of cytokines and growth factors. Tumor released cytokines or angiogenic factors stimulate vascular endothelial cells by interacting with specific cell surface receptors for the factors.  The activated endothelial cells secrete enzymes that degrade the basement membrane of the vessels.  The endothelial cells<br>
then proliferate and invade into the tumor tissue.  The endothelial cells differentiate to form lumens, making new vessel offshoots of pre-existing vessels.  The new blood vessels then provide nutrients to the tumor permitting further growth and a route for metastasis.<br>
Under normal conditions, endothelial cell proliferation is a very slow process, but it increases for a short period of time during embryogenesis, ovulation and wound heAL1ng.  This temporary increase in cell turnover is governed by a combination of a number of growth stimulatory factors and growth suppressing factors.  In pathological angiogenesis, this normal balance is disrupted resulting in continued increased endothelial cell proliferation.  Some of the proangiogenic factors that have been identified include basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), angiogenin, TGF-alpha, TGF-beta, and vascular endothelium growth factor (VEGF). While interferon-alpha, interferon-beta and thrombospondin are examples of angiogenesis suppressors.<br>
The proliferation and migration of endothelial cells in the extracellular matrix is mediated by interaction with a variety of cell adhesion molecules (Folkman, J., Nature Medicine , 1995, 1, 27-31). Integrins are a diverse family of heterodimeric cell surface receptors by which endothelial cells attach to the extracellular matrix, each other and other cells. The integrin αv3 is a receptor for a wide variety for a wide variety of extracellular matrix proteins with an exposed tripeptide Arg-Gly-Asp moiety and mediates cellular adhesion to its ligand: vitronectin, fibronectin, and fibrinogen, among others.  The integrin αv3 is minimally expressed on normal blood vessels, but is significantly upregulated on vascular cells within a<br>
variety of human tumors.  The role of the αv3 receptors is to mediate the interaction of the endothelial cells and the extracellular matrix and facilitate the migration of the cells in the direction of the angiogenic signal, the tumor cell population. Angiogenesis induced by bFGF or TNF-alpha depend on the agency of the integrin αv3, while angiogenesis induced by VEGF depends on the integrin αv3 (Cheresh et. al. , Science, 1955, 270, 1500-2).  Induction of expression of the integrins α11 and α21 on the endothelial cell surface is another important mechanism by which VEGF promotes angiogenesis (Senger, et. al., Proc. Natl. Acad, Sci USA, 1997, 84, 13612-7).<br>
Angiogenic factors interact with endothelial cell surface receptors such as the receptor tyrosine kinases EGFR, FGFR, PDGFR, Flk-1/KDR, Flt-1, Tek, tie, neuropilin-1, endoglin, endosiAL1n, and Axl.  The receptors Flk-1/KDR, neuropilin-1, and Flt-1 recognize VEGF and these interactions play key roles in VEGF-induced angiogenesis.  The Tie subfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases are also expressed prominently during blood vessel formation.<br>
Because of the importance of angiogenesis to tumor growth and metastasis, a number of chemotherapeutic approaches are being developed to interfere with or prevent this process.  One of these approaches, involves the use of anti-angiogenic proteins such as angiostatin and endostatin.  Angiostatin is a 38 kDa fragment of plasminogen that has been shown in animal models to be a potent inhibitor of endothelial cell proliferation. (O'Reilly et. al. , Cell, 1994, 79, 315-328)  Endostatin is a 20 kDa C-terminal fragment of collagen XVIII that has also been shown to be a potent inhibitor. (O'Reilly<br>
et. al., Cell, 1997, 88, 277-285)  Systemic therapy with endostatin has been shown to result in strong anti-tumor activity in animal models. However, human clinical trials of these two chemotherapeutic agents of biological origin have been hampered by lack of availability.<br>
Another approach to anti-angiogenic therapy is to use targeting moieties that interact with endothelial cell surface receptors expressed in the angiogenic vasculature to which are attached chemotherapeutic agents. Burrows and Thorpe (Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci, USA, 1993, 90, 8996-9000) described the use of an antibody-immunotoxin conjugate to eradicate tumors in a mouse model by destroying the tumor vasculature.  The antibody was raised against an endothelial cell class II antigen of the major histocompatibility complex and was then conjugated with the cytotoxic agent, deglycosylated ricin A chain. The same group (Clin. Can. Res., 1995, 1, 1623-1634) investigated the use of antibodies raised against the endothelial cell surface receptor, endoglin, conjugated to deglycosylated ricin A chain. Both of these conjugates exhibited potent anti-tumor activity in mouse models.  However, both still suffer drawbacks to routine human use.  As with most antibodies or other large, foreign proteins, there is considerable risk of immunologic toxicity which could limit or preclude administration to humans.  Also, while the vasculature targeting may improve the local concentration of the attached chemotherapeutic agents, the agents still must be cleaved from the antibody carrier and be transported or diffuse into the cells to be cytotoxic.<br>
Thus, it is desirable to provide anti-angiogenic pharmaceuticals and tumor or new vasculature imaging agents which do not suffer from poor diffusion or<br>
transportation, possible immunologic toxicity, limited availability, and/or a lack of specificity.<br>
There continues to be a need for more effective<br>
treatment options for patients with solid tumors.  This<br>
is especially true in cases of metastatic cancer in<br>
which current standard chemotherapy and external beam<br>
radiation regimens only result in marginal survival<br>
improvements.<br>
Although improvements in cytotoxic<br>
chemotherapeutics have been made in recent years, the<br>
toxicity of these compounds to normal tissues has<br>
continued to severely limit their utility in extending<br>
survival in patients with solid tumors.  Recently<br>
developed combinations of different therapeutic<br>
modAL1ties, such as external beam irradiation and<br>
chemotherapy (i.e. chemoradiation), has provided some<br>
incremental benefit to the control of tumor progression<br>
and quAL1ty of life. Combination treatment of<br>
brachytherapy with laser therapy in treating carcinomas<br>
have already been reported (Allen et al., Am. J. Surg.<br>
150:71, 1985; Schray et al., Int. J. Radiat. Oncol.<br>
Biol. Phys. 11:403, 1985-both incorporated in their<br>
entirety herein by reference), as well as the general<br>
use of brachytherapy in cancer by Nori et al., Surg.<br>
Clin. N. Amer. 67:1093, 1987, incorporated herein in its<br>
entirety by reference. However, neither systemic<br>
chemotherapeutics nor external beam irradiation have<br>
acceptable therapeutic indices, and are often limited<br>
due to unacceptable toxicity to normal tissues. The<br>
concept of combined therapy of cancer using anti-<br>
angiogenesis drugs in combination with chemotherapeutics<br>
is not new.  Further, the concept of combining targeted<br>
in-vivo radiotherapy using radiolabeled antibodies and antibody fragments with chemotherapy has been reported (Stein R, Juweid M, Zhang C, et al.,  Clin. Cancer Res., 5: 3199s-3206s, 1999. However, the combination of a angiogenesis-targeted therapeutic radiopharmaceutical which is targeted to receptors, which are then upregulated in the neovasculature of tumors, together with chemotherapy has not been described before. Therefore, there is a need for a combination of a therapeutic radiopharmaceutical, which is targeted to locAL1ze in the neovasculature of tumors, with anticancer agentss or a radiosensitizer agent, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, to provide additive or synergistic therapeutic response without unacceptable additive toxicity in the treatment of solid tumors.<br>
The major advantage of combined chemotherapy and angiogenesis-targeted therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals, over each therapeutic modAL1ty alone, is improved tumor response without substantial increases in toxicity over either treatment alone.  The advantage of using neovascular-specific radiopharmaceuticals, versus a tumor-cell targeted antibody, is that there is much lower systemic radiation exposure to the subject being treated.<br>
Further, if the receptor targets for the radiopharmaceutical compounds, used in this method of treatment, are expressed on the luminal side of tumor vessels, there is no requirement that these compounds traverse the capillary bed and bind to the tumor itself.<br>
Thus, it is desirable to provide a combination of angiogenesis-targeted therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals and an anti-cancer agents or a radiosensitizer agent, or<br>
a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof  which target<br>
the luminal side of the neovasculature of tumors  to<br>
provide a surprising  and enhanced degree of tumor<br>
suppression relative to each treatment modAL1ty alone<br>
without significant additive toxicity<br>
Photodynamic therapy has also been used in the<br>
treatment of cancer  Photodynamic therapy involves the<br>
administration of a photosensitive agent and subsequent<br>
irradiation with light to excite the photosensitizer<br>
thus producing a cytotoxic effect  Spears  U S  Pat  No<br>
4 512 762  and U S  Pat  No  4 566 636  Kelly  et al<br>
United States Patent 6 235 767<br>
In photodynamic therapy the photosensitizers used are capable of locAL1zing in mAL1gnant cells either by natural tendency or because they have been intentionally targeted to a specific type of tissue or both When irradiated they may be capable of fluorescing and thus may also be useful in diagnostic methods related to detecting target tissue However even more importantly the photosensitizer has the capacity when irradiated with light at a wavelength which the compound absorbs of causing a cytotoxic effect against whatever cells or other tissue in which the photosensitizer has locAL1zed<br>
In one form of this therapy a photosensitizer agent having a characteristic light absorption waveband is first administered to the patient  typically either orally or by injection Abnormal tissue in the body is known to selectively absorb certain photosensitizer agents to a much greater extent than normal tissue  More effective selectivity can be achieved using a photoreactive agent that is bound to an antibody which<br>
links with antigens on targeted cells  The cancerous or abnormal tissue that has absorbed or linked with the photosensitizer dye is then destroyed by administering light of an appropriate wavelength or waveband corresponding to the absorption wavelength or waveband of the photosensitizer agent<br>
Photosensitizing agents such as Photofrin  a haematoporphyrin derivative  are known  ( Dougherty T J  (1987) Photosensitizers: therapy and detection of mAL1gnant tumours  Photochem  Photobiol   45  879-889 and Boyle R W and D David (1996) Structure and biodistribution relationships of photodynamic sensitizers  Photochem  Photobiol  64  469-485) Also Rodgers et al   United States Patent No  6 225 333 discloses treating cancers with a variety of photosensitizing agents for example naphthalocyanine photosensitizing agents; tetrapyrrole-based photosensitizers; including porphyins; chlorins; phthalocyanines; napthalocyanines; coumarins and psoralens   Furthermore Mazur  et al   United States Patent No  6 229 048  discloses a method for treatment of solid tumors by photodynamic therapy comprising administering a photosensitizer selected from the group consisting of: 1 3 4 6-tetrahydroxyhelianthrone; 1,3 4 6-tetramethoxyhelianthrone; 10 13-dimethyl-13 4 6-tetrahydroxyhelianthrone; 10 13-di (methoxycarbonyl)-1 3 4 6-tetramethoxyhelianthrone; 1 6-di-N-butylamino-3 4-dimethoxy-helianthrone; 1 6-di-N-butylamino-3 4-dimethoxy-10,13-dimethyl-helianthrone; 1 6-di-(N-hydroxyethylamino)-3 4-dimethoxy-helianthrone;<br>
2 5-dibromo-l 3 4 6-tetrahydroxyhelianthrone; and 2 5-dibromo-10 13-dimethyl-l 3 4 6-tetrahydroxyhelianthrone<br>
In another method   green porphyrins  have been used in photodynamic therapy with light having a wavelength range around 670-780 run  See for example Levy et al   US  Pat  No  5 3 99 583 Levy et al   US Pat  No  4 92 0 143  Levy et al   US  Pat  No 5 095 030; and Levy et al   and U S  Pat  No  5 171 749<br>
In most photodynamic therapy protocols  a method must be found for the irradiating light to reach the targeted tissue where the photosensitizer has been locAL1zed  For example  a light-emitting balloon catheter may be used or alternatively a form of  liquid light  may be injected into the vascular tree such that the  liquid light   perfuses the vasculature at the target site  Spears  U S  Pat  No  4 512 762 Alternatively<br>
The targeted tissues are visually located by imaging the treatment site through a fiber optic system so that light from a laser source can be accurately directed through the optical fiber to destroy the abnormal tissue  Even when the internal treatment site is accessible through natural body orifices  an endoscope is usually required to visuAL1ze the targeted tissue and accurately direct the light therapy administered to the treatment site  Chen  United States Patent No  6 210 425 discloses an apparatus and a method to identify an internal treatment site within a patient s body for administration of light therapy and treatment of the site<br>
Thus  it is also desirable to provide a combination of a photosensitizer agent (as part of photodynamic therapy)  an angiogenesis-targeted therapeutic<br>
radiopharmaceutical and an anti-cancer agent or a<br>
radiosensitizer agent  or a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
salt thereof  which target the luminal side of the<br>
neovasculature of tumors  to provide a surprising  and<br>
enhanced degree of tumor suppression relative to each<br>
treatment modAL1ty alone without significant additive<br>
toxicity<br>
Another application of anti-angiogenic therapy is<br>
in treating rheumatoid arthritis (RA)   In RA  the<br>
ingrowth of a highly vascularized pannus is caused by<br>
the excessive production of angiogenic factors by the<br>
infiltrating macrophages  immune cells  or inflammatory<br>
cells  Therefore  it is desirable to have new<br>
pharmaceuticals to destroy the highly vascularized<br>
pannus that results and thus treat the disease<br>
There is also a growing interest in therapeutic<br>
angiogenesis to improve blood flow in regions of the<br>
body that have become ischemic or poorly perfused<br>
Several investigators are using growth factors<br>
administered locally to cause new vasculature to form<br>
either in the limbs or the heart   The growth factors<br>
VEGF and bFGF are the most common for this application<br>
Recent publications include:  Takeshita  S   et  al   J<br>
Clin  Invest   1994  93  662-670; and Schaper  W  and<br>
Schaper  J  Collateral Circulation:Heart  Brain<br>
Kidney  Limbs  Kluwer Academic Publishers  Boston  1993<br>
The main applications that are under investigation in a<br>
number of laboratories are for improving cardiac blood<br>
flow and in improving peripheral vessal blood flow in<br>
the limbs   For example  Henry T  et  al  (J Amer<br>
College Cardiology  1998  31  65A) describe the use of<br>
recombinant human VEGF in patients for improving<br>
myocardial perfusion by therapeutic angiogenesis<br>
Patients received infusions of rhVEGF and were monitored<br>
by nuclear perfusion imaging 3 0 and 60 days post treatment to determine improvement in myocardial perfusion   About 50% of patients showed improvement by nuclear perfusion imaging whereas 5/7 showed new collatorAL1zation by angiography  Thus  it is desirable to discover a method of monitoring improved cardiac blood flow which is targeted to new collatoral vessels themselves and not  as in nuclear perfusion imaging  a regional consequence of new collatoral vessels<br>
The detection  imaging and diagnosis of a number of cardiovascular diseases need to be improved  including restenosis  atherosclerosis  myocardial reperfusion injury  and myocardial ischemia  stunning or infarction It has recently been determined that in all of these disease conditions  the integrin receptor αv3 plays an important role<br>
For example  in the restenosis complication that occurs in -3 0-50% of patients having undergone angioplasty or stent placement  neointimal hyperplasia and ultimate reocclusion is caused by aggressively proliferating vascular smooth muscle cells that express<br>
αv3  (Cardiovascular Res   1997  36  408-428; DDT 1997  2, 187-199; Current Pharm  Design  1997, 3  545-584)<br>
Atherosclerosis proceeds from an intial endothelial damage that results in the recruitment and subintimal migration of monocytes at the site of the injury  Growth factors are released which induce medial smooth muscle cells to proliferate and migrate to the intimal layer<br>
The migrating smooth muscle cells express αv3<br>
In reperfusion injury  neutrophil transmigration is integrin dependent and the integrins moderate initial infiltration into the viable border zone  The induction<br><br>
of α5  α4 and αv5 in infiltrating neutrophils occurs within 3 to 5 hours after reperfusion as neutrophils move from the border zone to the area of necrosis  (Circulation  1999  100  1-275)<br>
Acute or chronic occlusion of a coronary artery is known to result in angiogenesis in the heart as native collateral vessels are recruited to attempt to relieve the ischemia  However  even a gradual occlusion usually results in areas of infarction as the resulting angiogenesis is not sufficient to prevent damage Cardiac angiogenesis has been associated with increased expression of the growth factors VEGF and FGF and the upregulation of the growth factor receptors flt-1 and flk-1/KDR   (Drugs  1999  58  391-396)<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is one object of the present invention to provide improved anti-angiogenic pharmaceuticals comprised of a targeting moiety that binds to the vitronectin receptor that is expressed in tumor neovasculature  an optional linking group  and a radioisotope   The vitronectin receptor binding compounds target the radioisotope to the tumor neovasculature  The beta or alpha-particle emitting radioisotope emits a cytotoxic amount of ionizing radiation which results in cell death  The penetrating ability of radiation obviates the requirement that the cytotoxic agent diffuse or be transported into the cell to be cytotoxic<br>

Methods for carrying out photodynamic therapy, and photosensitizers which can be used, are well known in the art.  For example, they are described in the following patents which are herein incorporated in their entiretyrU.S. Patent No.s 6,248,741, 6,248,734, 6,248,727, 6,248,117, 6,245,811, 6,238,426, 6,238,392,<br>

It is appreciated that certain features of the invention, which are, for clarity, described in the context of separate embodiments, may also be provided in combination in a single embodiment. Conversely, various features of the invention which are for brevity, described in the context of a single embodiment, may also be provided separately or in any subcombination.<br>
DEFINITIONS<br>
The compounds herein described may have asymmetric centers.  Unless otherwise indicated, all chiral, diastereomeric and racemic forms are included in the present invention.  Many geometric isomers of olefins, C=N double bonds, and the like can also be present in the compounds described herein, and all such stable isomers are contemplated in the present invention.  It will be appreciated that compounds of the present invention contain asymmetrically substituted carbon atoms, and may be isolated in optically active or racemic forms.  It is well known in the art how to prepare optically active forms, such as by resolution of racemic forms or by synthesis from optically active starting materials.  Two distinct isomers (cis and trans) of the peptide bond are known to occur; both can also be present in the compounds described herein, and all such stable isomers are contemplated in the present invention.  The D and L-isomers of a particular amino acid are designated herein using the conventional<br>
3-letter abbreviation of the amino acid, as indicated by the following examples: D-Leu, or L-Leu.<br>
When any variable occurs more than one time in any substituent or in any formula, its definition on each occurrence is independent of its definition at every other occurrence.  Thus, for example, if a group is shown to be substituted with 0-2 R52, then said group may optionally be substituted with up to two R52, and R52 at each occurrence is selected independently from the defined list of possible R52.  Also, by way of example, for the group -N(R53)2- each of the two R53 substituents on N is independently selected from the defined list of possible R53.  Combinations of substituents and/or variables are permissible only if such combinations result in stable compounds.  When a bond to a substituent is shown to cross the bond connecting two atoms in a ring, then such substituent may be bonded to any atom on the ring.<br>
The term "nonpeptide" means preferably less than three amide bonds in the backbone core of the targeting moiety or preferably less than three amino acids or amino acid mimetics in the targeting moiety.<br>
The term "metallopharmaceutical" means a pharmaceutical comprising a metal. The metal is the cause of the imageable signal in diagnostic applications and the source of the cytotoxic radiation in radiotherapeutic applications.  Radiopharmaceuticals are metallopharmaceuticals in which the metal is a radioisotope.<br>
By "reagent" is meant a compound of this invention capable of direct transformation into a<br>
metallopharmaceutical of this invention.  Reagents may be utilized directly for the preparation of the<br>
metallopharmaceuticals of this invention or may be a component in a kit of this invention.<br>
The term "binding agent" means a metallopharmaceutical of this invention having affinity for and capable of binding to the vitronectin receptor. The binding agents of this invention have Ki 
By "stable compound" or "stable structure" is meant herein a compound that is sufficiently robust to survive isolation to a useful degree of purity from a reaction mixture, and formulation into an efficacious pharmaceutical agent.<br>
The term "substituted", as used herein, means that one or more hydrogens on the designated atom or group is replaced with a selection from the indicated group, provided that the designated atom's or group's normal valency is not exceeded, and that the substitution results in a stable compound.  When a substituent is keto (i.e., =O), then 2 hydrogens on the atom are replaced.<br>
The term "bond", as used herein, means either a single or double bond.<br>
The term "salt", as used herein, is used as defined in the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 65th Edition, CRC Press, Boca Raton, Fla, 1984, as any substance which yields ions, other than hydrogen or hydroxyl ions.  As used herein, "pharmaceutically acceptable salts" refer to derivatives of the disclosed compounds modified by making acid or base salts. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but are not limited to, mineral or organic acid salts of basic residues such as amines; alkAL1 or organic salts of acidic residues such as carboxylic acids; and the like.<br>
The phrase "pharmaceutically acceptable" is employed herein to refer to those compounds, materials, compositions, and/or dosage forms which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of human beings and animals without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problem or complication, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio.<br>
The phrase "pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs" as used herein means those prodrugs of the compounds useful according to the present invention which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of humans and lower animals with undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response, and the like, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio, and effective for their intended use, as well as the zwitterionic forms, where possible, of the compounds of the invention.  The term "prodrug" means compounds that are rapidly transformed in  vivo  to yield the parent compound of the above formula, for example by hydrolysis in blood. Functional groups which may be rapidly transformed, by metabolic cleavage, in vivo form a class of groups reactive with the carboxyl group of the compounds of this invention.  They include, but are not limited to such groups as alkanoyl (such as acetyl, propionyl, butyryl, and the like), unsubstituted and substituted aroyl (such as benzoyl and substituted benzoyl), alkoxycarbonyl (such as ethoxycarbonyl), trialkylsilyl (such as trimethyl- and triethysilyl), monoesters formed with dicarboxylic acids (such as succinyl), and the like.  Because of the ease with which the metabolically cleavable groups of the compounds useful according to this invention are cleaved in vivo, the compounds bearing such groups act as pro-drugs.  The compounds bearing the metabolically cleavable groups<br>
have the advantage that they may exhibit improved<br>
bioavailability as a result of enhanced solubility<br>
and/or rate of absorption conferred upon the parent<br>
compound by virtue of the presence of the metabolically<br>
cleavable group. A thorough discussion of prodrugs is<br>

As used herein, "pharmaceutically acceptable salts"<br>
refer to derivatives of the disclosed compounds wherein<br>
the parent compound is modified by making acid or base<br>
salts thereof.  Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
salts include, but are not limited to, mineral or<br>
organic acid salts of basic residues such as amines;<br>
alkAL1 or organic salts of acidic residues such as<br>
carboxylic acids; and the like.  The pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts include the conventional non-toxic<br>
salts or the quaternary ammonium salts of the parent<br>
compound formed, for example, from non-toxic inorganic<br>
or organic acids.  For example, such conventional<br>
non-toxic salts include those derived from inorganic<br>
acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric,<br>
sulfamic, phosphoric, nitric and the like; and the salts<br>
prepared from organic acids such as acetic, propionic, succinic, glycolic, stearic, lactic, tartaric, citric, ascorbic, pamoic, maleic, hydroxymaleic, phenylacetic, glutamic, benzoic, sAL1cylic, sulfanilic, 2-acetoxybenzoic, fumaric, toluenesulfonic, methanesulfonic, ethane disulfonic, oxAL1c, isethionic, and the like.<br>
The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the present invention can be synthesized from the parent compound which contains a basic or acidic moiety by conventional chemical methods.  Generally, such salts can be prepared by reacting the free acid or base forms of these compounds with a stoichiometric amount of the appropriate base or acid in water or in an organic solvent, or in a mixture of the two; generally, nonaqueous media like ether, ethyl acetate, ethanol, isopropanol, or acetonitrile are preferred.  Lists of suitable salts are found in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 17th ed., Mack Publishing Company, Easton, PA, 1985, p. 1418, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>

radiopharmaceuticals and in diagnostic kits useful for the preparation of said radiopharmaceuticals include but are not limited to stannous chloride, stannous fluoride, formamidine sulfinic acid, ascorbic acid, cysteine, phosphines, and cuprous or ferrous salts.  Other reducing agents are described in Brodack et. al., PCT Application 94/22496, which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
A "transfer ligand" is a ligand that forms an intermediate complex with a metal ion that is stable enough to prevent unwanted side-reactions but labile enough to be converted to a metallopharmaceutical. The formation of the intermediate complex is kinetically favored while the formation of the metallopharmaceutical is thermodynamically favored.

The term "donor atom" refers to the atom directly attached to a metal by a chemical bond.<br>
"Ancillary" or "co-ligands" are ligands that are incorporated into a radiopharmaceutical during its synthesis.  They serve to complete the coordination sphere of the radionuclide together with the chelator or radionuclide bonding unit of the reagent.  For radiopharmaceuticals comprised of a binary ligand system, the radionuclide coordination sphere is composed of one or more chelators or bonding units from one or more reagents and one or more ancillary or co-ligands, provided that there are a total of two types of ligands,<br>
chelators or bonding units.  For example, a radiopharmaceutical comprised of one chelator or bonding unit from one reagent and two of the same ancillary or co-ligands and a radiopharmaceutical comprised of two chelators or bonding units from one or two reagents and one ancillary or co-ligand are both considered to be comprised of binary ligand systems.  For radiopharmaceuticals comprised of a ternary ligand system, the radionuclide coordination sphere is composed of one or more chelators or bonding units from one or more reagents and one or more of two different types of ancillary or co-ligands, provided that there are a total of three types of ligands, chelators or bonding units. For example, a radiopharmaceutical comprised of one chelator or bonding unit from one reagent and two different ancillary or co-ligands is considered to be comprised of a ternary ligand system.<br>
Ancillary or co-ligands useful in the preparation of radiopharmaceuticals and in diagnostic kits useful for the preparation of said radiopharmaceuticals are comprised of one or more oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, sulfur, phosphorus, arsenic, selenium, and tellurium donor atoms.  A ligand can be a transfer ligand in the synthesis of a radiopharmaceutical and also serve as an ancillary or co-ligand in another radiopharmaceutical. Whether a ligand is termed a transfer or ancillary or co-ligand depends on whether the ligand remains in the radionuclide coordination sphere in the radiopharmaceutical, which is determined by the coordination chemistry of the radionuclide and the chelator or bonding unit of the reagent or reagents.<br>
A "chelator" or "bonding unit" is the moiety or group on a reagent that binds to a metal ion through the<br>
formation of chemical bonds with one or more donor atoms.<br>
The term "binding site"  means the site in vivo or in vitro that binds a biologically active molecule.<br>
A "diagnostic kit" or "kit" comprises a collection of components, termed the formulation, in one or more vials which are used by the practicing end user in a clinical or pharmacy setting to synthesize diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals.

Therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals, X-ray contrast agent pharmaceuticals, ultrasound contrast agent pharmaceuticals and metallopharmaceuticals for magnetic resonance imaging contrast are provided to the end user in their final form in a formulation contained typically in one vial, as either a lyophilized solid or an aqueous solution.  The end user reconstitutes the lyophilized with water or sAL1ne and withdraws the patient dose or just withdraws the dose from the aqueous solution formulation as provided.<br>
A "lyophilization aid" is a component that has favorable physical properties for lyophilization, such as the glass transition temperature, and is added to the formulation to improve the physical properties of the combination of all the components of the formulation for lyophilization.<br>
A "stabilization aid" is a component that is added to the metallopharmaceutical or to the diagnostic kit either to stabilize the metallopharmaceutical or to prolong the shelf-life of the kit before it must be used.  Stabilization aids can be antioxidants, reducing agents or radical scavengers and can provide improved stability by reacting preferentially with species that degrade other components or the metallopharmaceutical.<br>
A "solubilization aid" is a component that improves the solubility of one or more other components in the medium required for the formulation.<br>

Angiogenesis is the process of formation of new capillary blood vessels from existing vasculature. It is an important component of a variety of physiological<br>
processes including ovulation, embryonic development, wound repair, and collateral vascular generation in the myocardium. It is also central to a number of pathological conditions such as tumor growth and metastasis, diabetic retinopathy, and macular degeneration. The process begins with the activation of existing vascular endothelial cells in response to a variety of cytokines and growth factors. The activated endothelial cells secrete enzymes that degrade the basement membrane of the vessels.  The endothelial cells then proliferate and migrate into the extracellular matrix first forming tubules and subsequently new blood vessels.<br>
Under normal conditions, endothelial cell proliferation is a very slow process, but it increases for a short period of time during embryogenesis, ovulation and wound heAL1ng.  This temporary increase in cell turnover is governed by a combination of a number of growth stimulatory factors and growth suppressing factors.  In pathological angiogenesis, this normal balance is disrupted resulting in continued increased endothelial cell proliferation.  Some of the pro-angiogenic factors that have been identified include basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), angiogenin,  TGF-alpha, TGF-beta, and vascular endothelium growth factor (VEGF), while interferon-alpha, interferon-beta and thrombospondin are examples of angiogenesis suppressors.<br>
Angiogenic factors interact with endothelial cell surface receptors such as the receptor tyrosine kinases EGFR, FGFR, PDGFR, Flk-1/KDR, Flt-1, Tek, Tie, neuropilin-1, endoglin, endosiAL1n, and Axl. The receptors Flk-1/KDR, neuropilin-1,  and Flt-1 recognize VEGF and these interactions play key roles in VEGF-induced angiogenesis.  The Tie subfamily of receptor<br>
tyrosine kinases are also expressed prominently during blood vessel formation.<br>
The proliferation and migration of endothelial cells in the extracellular matrix is mediated by interaction with a variety of cell adhesion molecules. Integrins are a diverse family of heterodimeric cell surface receptors by which endothelial cells attach to the extracellular matrix, each other and other cells. Angiogenesis induced by bFGF or TNF-alpha depend on the agency of the integrin avb3, while angiogenesis induced by VEGF depends on the integrin avb5 (Cheresh et. al., Science, 1995, 270, 1500-2).  Induction of expression of the integrins albl and a2bl on the endothelial cell surface is another important mechanism by which VEGF promotes angiogenesis (Senger, et. al., Proc. Natl. Acad, Sci USA, 1997, 94, 13612-7).<br>
The pharmaceuticals of the present invention are comprised of a non-peptide targeting moiety for the vitronectin receptor that is expressed or upregulated in angiogenic tumor vasculature.<br>
The ultrasound contrast agents of the present invention comprise a plurAL1ty of vitronectin receptor targeting moieties attached to or incorporated into a microbubble of a biocompatible gas, a liquid carrier, and a surfactant microsphere, further comprising an optional linking moiety, Ln, between the targeting moieties and the microbubble.  In this context, the term liquid carrier means aqueous solution and the term surfactant means any amphiphilic material which produces a reduction in interfacial tension in a solution. A list of suitable surfactants for forming surfactant microspheres is disclosed in EP0727225A2, herein incorporated by reference.  The term surfactant<br>
microsphere includes nanospheres, liposomes, vesicles and the like.  The biocompatible gas can be air, or a fluorocarbon, such as a C3-C5 perfluoroalkane, which provides the difference in echogenicity and thus the contrast in ultrasound imaging.  The gas is encapsulated or contained in the microsphere to which is attached the biodirecting group, optionally via a linking group.  The attachment can be covalent, ionic or by van der Waals forces.  Specific examples of such contrast agents include lipid encapsulated perfluorocarbons with a plurAL1ty of tumor neovasculature receptor binding peptides, polypeptides or peptidomimetics.<br>
X-ray contrast agents of the present invention are comprised of one or more vitronectin receptor targeting moieties attached to one or more X-ray absorbing or "heavy" atoms of atomic number 20 or greater, further comprising an optional linking moiety, Ln, between the targeting moieties and the X-ray absorbing atoms. The frequently used heavy atom in X-ray contrast agents is iodine. Recently, X-ray contrast agents comprised of metal chelates (Wallace, R., U.S. 5,417,959) and polychelates comprised of a plurAL1ty of metal ions (Love, D., U.S. 5,679,810) have been disclosed. More recently, multinuclear cluster complexes have been disclosed as X-ray contrast agents (U.S. 5,804,161, PCT WO91/14460, and PCT WO 92/17215).<br>
MRI contrast agents of the present invention are comprised of one or more vitronectin receptor targeting moieties attached to one or more paramagnetic metal ions, further comprising an optional linking moiety, Ln, between the targeting moieties and the paramagnetic metal ions. The paramagnetic metal ions are present in the form of metal complexes or metal oxide particles.<br>
U.S. 5,412,148, and 5,760,191, describe examples of chelators for paramagnetic metal ions for use in MRI contrast agents.  U.S. 5,801,228, U.S. 5,567,411, and U.S. 5,281,704, describe examples of polychelants useful for complexing more than one paramagnetic metal ion for use in MRI contrast agents.  U.S. 5,520,904, describes particulate compositions comprised of paramagnetic metal ions for use as MRI contrast agents.<br>
Administration of a compound of the present invention in combination with such additional therapeutic agents, may afford an efficacy advantage over the compounds and agents alone, and may do so while permitting the use of lower doses of each. A lower dosage minimizes the potential of side effects, thereby providing an increased margin of safety. The combination of a compound of the present invention with such additional therapeutic agents is preferably a synergistic combination. Synergy, as described for example by Chou and Talalay, Adv. Enzyme Regul. 22:27-55 (1984), occurs when the therapeutic effect of the compound and agent when administered in combination is greater than the additive effect of the either the compound or agent when administered alone. In general, a synergistic effect is most clearly demonstrated at levels that are (therapeutically) sub-optimal for either the compound of the present invention, an anti-cancer agent or a radiosensitizer agent alone, but which are highly efficacious in combination. Synergy can be in terms of improved tumor response without substantial increases in toxicity over individual treatments alone, or some other beneficial effect of the combination compared with the individual components.<br>
The compounds of the present invention, and an anti-cancer agent or a radiosensitizer agent, utilized in combination therapy may be administered<br>
simultaneously, in either separate or combined<br>
formulations, or at different times e.g., sequentially,<br>
such that a combined effect is achieved. The amounts and<br>
regime of administration will be adjusted by the<br>
practitioner, by preferably initially lowering their<br>
standard doses and then titrating the results obtained.<br>
The invention also provides kits or single<br>
packages combining two or more active ingredients useful<br>
in treating cancer.  A kit may provide (alone or in<br>
combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent<br>
or carrier), the compound of the present invention and<br>
additionally at least one agent selected from the group<br>
consisting of an anti-cancer agent and a radiosensitizer<br>
agent (alone or in combination with diluent or carrier). The pharmaceuticals of the present invention have<br>
the formulae, (Q)d"Ln-(Ch-X) , (Q)d-Ln-(Ch-X1) d   wherein Q represents a non-peptide that binds to a receptor expressed in angiogenic tumor vasculature, d is 1-10,  Ln represents an optional linking group, Ch represents a metal chelator or bonding moiety, X represents a radioisotope, X1 represents paramagnetic metal ion, X2 represents a paramagnetic metal ion or heavy atom containing insoluble solid particle, d" is 1-100, and X3 represents a surfactant microsphere of an echogenic gas.    The interaction of the non-peptide recognition sequences of the vitronectin receptor binding portion of the pharmaceuticals with the av^3 receptor results in locAL1zation of the pharmaceuticals in angiogenic tumor vasculature, which express the avp3 receptor.<br>
The pharmaceuticals of the present invention can be synthesized by several approaches.  One approach involves the synthesis of the targeting non-peptide<br>
moiety, Q, and direct attachment of one or more moieties, Q, to one or more metal chelators or bonding moieties, Ch, or to a paramagnetic metal ion or heavy atom containing solid particle, or to an echogenic gas microbubble. Another approach involves the attachment of one or more moieties, Q, to the linking group, Ln, which is then attached to one or more metal chelators or bonding moieties, Ch, or to a paramagnetic metal ion or heavy atom containing solid particle, or to an echogenic gas microbubble.    Another approach involves the synthesis of a non-peptide, Q, bearing a fragment of the linking group, Ln, one or more of which are then attached to the remainder of the linking group and then to one or more metal chelators or bonding moieties, Ch, or to a paramagnetic metal ion or heavy atom containing solid particle, or to an echogenic gas microbubble.<br>
The non-peptide vitronectin binding moieties, Q, optionally bearing a linking group, Ln, or a fragment of the linking group, can be synthesized using standard synthetic methods known to those skilled in the art. Preferred methods include but are not limited to those methods described below.<br>
The attachment of linking groups, Ln, to the non-peptides, Q; chelators or bonding units, Ch, to the non-pep tides, Q, or to the linking groups, Ln; and non-peptides, bearing a fragment of the linking group to the remainder of the linking group, in combination forming the moiety, (Q)d-Ln/ an
<br>
in Brinkley, M., Bioconjugate Chemistry 1992, 3(1), which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
A number of methods can be used to attach the non-peptides, Q, to paramagnetic metal ion or heavy atom containing solid particles, X2, by one of skill in the art of the surface modification of solid particles. In general, the targeting moiety Q or the combination (Q)dLn is attached to a coupling group that react with a constituent of the surface of the solid particle.  The coupling groups can be any of a number of silanes which react with surface hydroxyl groups on the solid particle surface, as described in co-pending United States Patent Application Serial No. 09/356,178, and can also include polyphosphonates, polycarboxylates, polyphosphates or mixtures thereof which couple with the surface of the solid particles, as described in U.S. 5,520,904.<br>
A number of reaction schemes can be used to attach the non-peptides,  Q, to the surfactant microsphere, X3. These are illustrated in following reaction schemes where Sf represents a surfactant moiety that forms the surfactant microsphere.<br>
Acylation Reaction:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Y is a leaving group or active ester<br>
Disulfide Coupling:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Sulfonamide Coupling:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Reductive  Amidation:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
In these reaction schemes,  the substituents Sf and Q can be reversed as well.<br>
The linking group Ln can serve several roles. First it provides a spacing group between the metal chelator or bonding moiety, Ch, the paramagnetic metal<br>
ion or heavy atom containing solid particle, X2, and the surfactant microsphere, X3, and the one or more of the non-peptides, Q, so as to minimize the possibility that the moieties Ch-X, Ch-X1, X2, and X3, will interfere with the interaction of the recognition sequences of Q with angiogenic tumor vasculature receptors.  The necessity of incorporating a linking group in a reagent is dependent on the identity of Q, Ch~X, Ch-X1, X2, and X3. If Ch-X, Ch-X1, X2, and X3, cannot be attached to Q without substantially diminishing its affinity for the receptors, then a linking group is used.  A linking group also provides a means of independently attaching multiple non-peptides, Q, to one group that is attached to Ch-X, Ch-X1, X2, or X3.<br>
The linking group also provides a means of incorporating a pharmacokinetic modifier into the pharmaceuticals of the present invention.  The pharmacokinetic modifier serves to direct the<br><br>
biodistibution of the injected pharmaceutical other than by the interaction of the targeting moieties, Q,  with the vitronectin receptors expressed in the tumor neovasculature.  A wide variety of functional groups can serve as pharmacokinetic modifiers, including, but not limited to, carbohydrates, polyalkylene glycols, peptides or other polyamino acids, and cyclodextrins. The modifiers can be used to enhance or decrease hydrophilicity and to enhance or decrease the rate of blood clearance.  The modifiers can also be used to direct the route of elimination of the pharmaceuticals. Preferred pharmacokinetic modifiers are those that result in moderate to fast blood clearance and enhanced renal excretion.<br>
The metal chelator or bonding moiety, Ch, is selected to form stable complexes with the metal ion chosen for the particular application.  Chelators or bonding moieties for diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals are selected to form stable complexes with the radioisotopes that have imageable gamma ray or positron emissions,<br>
SUCh   as   99mTc,   95TC/    Him,    62CU/    60CU/    64CU/    67Ga#     68GS/ 86y.<br>
Chelators for technetium, copper and gallium isotopes  are selected from diaminedithiols, monoamine-monoamidedithiols , triamide-monothiols, monoamine-diamide-monothiols, diaminedioximes, and hydrazines.  The chelators are generally tetradentate with donor atoms selected from nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur.  Preferred reagents are comprised of chelators having amine nitrogen and thiol sulfur donor atoms and hydrazine bonding units.  The thiol sulfur atoms and the hydrazines may bear a protecting group which can be displaced either prior to using the reagent to<br>
synthesize a radiopharmaceutical or preferably in situ during the synthesis of the radiopharmaceutical.<br>
Exemplary thiol protecting groups include those listed in Greene and Wuts, "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis" John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York (1991), the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. Any thiol protecting group known in the art can be used. Examples of thiol protecting groups include, but are not limited to, the following: acetamidomethyl, benzamidomethyl, 1-ethoxyethyl, benzoyl, and triphenylmethyl.<br>
Exemplary protecting groups for hydrazine bonding units are hydrazones which can be aldehyde or ketone hydrazones having substituents selected from hydrogen, alkyl, aryl and heterocycle.  Particularly preferred hydrazones are described in co-pending U.S.S.N. 08/476,296 the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
The hydrazine bonding unit when bound to a metal radionuclide is termed a hydrazido, or diazenido group and serves as the point of attachment of the radionuclide to the remainder of the<br>
radiopharmaceutical. A diazenido group can be either terminal (only one atom of the group is bound to the radionuclide) or chelating.  In order to have a chelating  diazenido group at least one other atom of the group must also be bound to the radionuclide.  The atoms bound to the metal are termed donor atoms.<br>
Chelators for 11:LIn and 86Y are selected from cyclic and acyclic polyaminocarboxylates such as DTPA, DOTA, D03A, 2-benzyl-DOTA, alpha-(2-phenethyl)1,4,7 ,10-tetraazazcyclododecane-l-acetic-4,7,10-tris(methylacetic)acid, 2-benzyl-<br>

For a transition metal radionuclide to be stable it typically has a coordination number (number of donor atoms) comprised of an integer greater than or equal to 4 and less than or equal to 8; that is there are 4 to 8 atoms bound to the metal and it is said to have a complete coordination sphere.  The requisite coordination number for a stable radionuclide complex is determined by the identity of the radionuclide, its oxidation state, and the type of donor atoms.  If the chelator or bonding unit does not provide all of the atoms necessary to stabilize the metal radionuclide by completing its coordination sphere, the coordination sphere is completed by donor atoms from other ligands, termed ancillary or co-ligands, which can also be either terminal or chelating.<br>
A large number of ligands can serve as ancillary or co-ligands, the choice of which is determined by a variety of considerations such as the ease of synthesis of the radiopharmaceutical, the chemical and physical properties of the ancillary ligand, the rate of<br>
coordinate to the metal ion through at least two oxygen<br>
formation, the yield, and the number of isomeric forms of the resulting radiopharmaceuticals, the ability to administer said ancillary or co-ligand to a patient without adverse physiological consequences to said patient, and the compatibility of the ligand in a lyophilized kit formulation.  The charge and lipophilicity of the ancillary ligand will effect the charge and lipophilicity of the radiopharmaceuticals. For example, the use of 4,5-dihydroxy-l,3-benzene disulfonate results in  radiopharmaceuticals with an additional two anionic groups because the sulfonate groups will be anionic under physiological conditions. The use of N-alkyl substituted 3,4-hydroxypyridinones results in radiopharmaceuticals with varying degrees of lipophilicity depending on the size of the alkyl substituents.<br>
Preferred technetium radiopharmaceuticals of the present invention are comprised of a hydrazido or diazenido bonding unit and an ancillary ligand, AL1, or a bonding unit and two types of ancillary AL1 and AL2 , or a tetradentate chelator comprised of two nitrogen and two sulfur atoms.  Ancillary ligands AL1 are comprised<br>
of two or more hard donor atoms such as oxygen and amine nitrogen (sp3 hybridized).  The donor atoms occupy at least two of the sites in the coordination sphere of the radionuclide metal; the ancillary ligand AL1 serves as one of the three ligands in the ternary ligand system. Examples of ancillary ligands AL1 include but are not limited to dioxygen ligands and functionAL1zed aminocarboxylates.  A large number of such ligands are available from commercial sources.<br>
Ancillary dioxygen ligands include ligands that coordinate to the metal ion through at least two oxygen<br>
donor atoms.  Examples include but are not limited to: glucoheptonate, gluconate, 2-hydroxyisobutyrate, lactate, tartrate, mannitol, glucarate, maltol, Kojic acid, 2,2-bis(hydroxymethyl)propionic acid, 4,5-dihydroxy-l,3-benzene disulfonate, or substituted or unsubstituted 1,2 or 3,4 hydroxypyridinones.  (The names for the ligands in these examples refer to either the protonated or non-protonated forms of the ligands.)<br>
FunctionAL1zed aminocarboxylates include ligands that have a combination of amine nitrogen and oxygen donor atoms.  Examples include but are not limited to: iminodiacetic acid, 2,3-diaminopropionic acid, nitrilotriacetic acid, N,N'-ethylenediamine diacetic acid, N,N,N'-ethylenediamine triacetic acid, hydroxyethylethylenediamine triacetic acid, and N,N'-ethylenediamine bis-hydroxyphenylglycine.

(sp2 hybridized), sulfur (sp2 hybridized) and carbon (sp hybridized); atoms which have p-acid character.  Ligands AL2 can be monodentate, bidentate or tridentate, the denticity is defined by the number of donor atoms in the ligand.  One of the two donor atoms in a bidentate ligand and one of the three donor atoms in a tridentate ligand must be a soft donor atom.  We have disclosed in co-pending U.S.S.N. 08/415,908, and U.S.S.N. 60/013360 and 08/646,886, the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety, that radiopharmaceuticals comprised of one or more ancillary or co-ligands AL2 are more stable compared to radiopharmaceuticals that are not comprised of one or more ancillary ligands, AL2; that is, they have a minimal number of isomeric forms, the relative ratios of which do not change significantly with time, and that remain substantially intact upon dilution.<br>
The ligands AL2 that are comprised of phosphine or arsine donor atoms are trisubstituted phosphines, trisubstituted arsines, tetrasubstituted diphosphines and tetrasubstituted diarsines.

Examples of such functional groups include but are not limited to: hydroxyl, carboxyl, carboxamide, nitro, ether, ketone, amino, ammonium, sulfonate, sulfonamide, phosphonate, and phosphonamide.  The functional groups may be chosen to alter the lipophilicity and water solubility of the ligands which may affect the biological properties of the radiopharmaceuticals, such as altering the distribution into non-target tissues, cells or fluids, and the mechanism and rate of elimination from the body.<br>
Chelators or bonding moieties for therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals are selected to form stable complexes with the radioisotopes that have alpha particle, beta particle, Auger or Coster-Kronig electron emissions, such as 186Re, 188Re, 153Sm, 166Ho, 177Lu, 149Pm# 90Y/ 212Bi# 103pd/ 109pd# 159Gd( 140La/ 198AU/ 199AU/ 169Yb, 175Yb, isSDy, 166Dy/ 67CU/ 105Rh/ HlAg, and 192ir.<br>

The technetium and rhenium radiopharmaceuticals of the present invention comprised of a hydrazido or diazenido bonding unit can be easily prepared by admixing a salt of a radionuclide, a reagent of the present invention, an ancillary ligand AL1, an ancillary ligand AL2- and a reducing agent, in an aqueous solution at temperatures from 0 to 100 °C.  The technetium and rhenium radiopharmaceuticals of the present invention comprised of a tetradentate chelator having two nitrogen and two sulfur atoms can be easily prepared by admixing a salt of a radionuclide, a reagent of the present<br><br>
invention, and a reducing agent, in an aqueous solution at temperatures from 0 to 100 °C.<br>
When the bonding unit in the reagent of the present invention is present as a hydrazone group, then it must first be converted to a hydrazine, which may or may not be protonated, prior to complexation with the metal radionuclide.  The conversion of the hydrazone group to the hydrazine can occur either prior to reaction with the radionuclide, in which case the radionuclide and the ancillary or co-ligand or ligands are combined not with the reagent but with a hydrolyzed form of the reagent bearing the chelator or bonding unit, or in the presence of the radionuclide in which case the reagent itself is combined with the radionuclide and the ancillary or co-ligand or ligands.  In the latter case, the pH of the reaction mixture must be neutral or acidic.<br>

Alternatively, the radiopharmaceuticals of the present invention comprised of a hydrazido or diazenido bonding unit can be prepared by first admixing a salt of a radionuclide, an ancillary ligand AL1, a reagent of the present invention, and a reducing agent in an aqueous solution at temperatures from 0 to 100 °C to form an intermediate radionuclide complex, and then<br>
adding an ancillary ligand AL2 and reacting further at temperatures from 0 to 100 °C.<br>
The technetium and rhenium radionuclides are preferably in the chemical form of pertechnetate or perrhenate and a pharmaceutically acceptable cation. The pertechnetate salt form is preferably sodium pertechnetate such as obtained from commercial Tc-99m generators.  The amount of pertechnetate used to prepare the radiopharmaceuticals of the present invention can range from 0.1 mCi to 1 Ci, or more preferably from 1 to 200 mCi.<br>
The amount of the reagent of the present invention used to prepare the technetium and rhenium radiopharmaceuticals of the present invention  can range from 0.01 ]ig to 10 mg, or more preferably from 0.5 ug to 2 00 ug.  The amount used will be dictated by the amounts of the other reactants and the identity of the radiopharmaceuticals of the present invention to be prepared.<br>
The amounts of the ancillary ligands AL1 used can range from 0.1 mg to 1 g, or more preferably from 1 mg to 100 mg.  The exact amount for a particular radiopharmaceutical is a function of identity of the radiopharmaceuticals of the present invention to be prepared, the procedure used and the amounts and identities of the other reactants.  Too large an amount of AL1 will result in the formation of by-products comprised of technetium labeled AL1 without a biologically active molecule or by-products comprised of technetium labeled biologically active molecules with the ancillary ligand AL1 but without the ancillary ligand AL2 •  Too small an amount of AL1 will result in other by-products such as technetium labeled<br><br>
biologically active molecules with the ancillary ligand AL2 but without the ancillary ligand AL1, or reduced hydrolyzed technetium, or technetium colloid.<br>
The amounts of the ancillary ligands AL2 used can range from 0.001 mg to 1 g, or more preferably from 0.01 mg to 10 mg.  The exact amount for a particular radiopharmaceutical is a function of the identity of the radiopharmaceuticals of the present invention to be prepared, the procedure used and the amounts and identities of the other reactants.  Too large an amount of AL2 will result in the formation of by-products comprised of technetium labeled AL2 without a biologically active molecule or by-products comprised of technetium labeled biologically active molecules with the ancillary ligand AL2 but without the ancillary ligand AL1.  If the reagent bears one or more substituents that are comprised of a soft donor atom, as defined above, at least a ten-fold molar excess of the ancillary ligand AL2 to the reagent of formula 2 is required to prevent the substituent from interfering with the coordination of the ancillary ligand AL2 to the metal radionuclide.<br>
Suitable reducing agents for the synthesis of the radiopharmaceuticals of the present invention include stannous salts, dithionite or bisulfite salts, borohydride salts, and formamidinesulfinic acid, wherein the salts are of any pharmaceutically acceptable form. The preferred reducing agent is a stannous salt.  The amount of a reducing agent used can range from 0.001 mg to 10 mg, or more preferably from 0.005 mg to 1 mg.<br>
The specific structure of a radiopharmaceutical of the present invention comprised of a hydrazido or diazenido bonding unit will depend on the identity of<br>
the reagent of the present invention used, the identity of any ancillary ligand AL1, the identity of any ancillary ligand AL2,   and the identity of the radionuclide.  Radiopharmaceuticals comprised of a hydrazido or diazenido bonding unit synthesized using concentrations of reagents of 1 mg/mL concentrations will be comprised of two hydrazido or diazenido groups from two reagent molecules.  For most applications, only a limited amount of the biologically active molecule can be injected and not result in undesired side-effects, such as chemical toxicity, interference with a biological process or an altered biodistribution of the radiopharmaceutical. Therefore, the radiopharmaceuticals which require higher concentrations of the reagents comprised in part of the biologically active molecule, will have to be diluted or purified after synthesis to avoid such side-effects.<br>
The identities and amounts used of the ancillary ligands AL1 and AL2 will determine the values of the variables y and z.  The values of y and z can independently be an integer from 1 to 2.  In combination, the values of y and z will result in a technetium coordination sphere that is made up of at least five and no more than seven donor atoms.  For monodentate ancillary ligands AL2 , z can be an integer from 1 to 2; for bidentate or tridentate ancillary ligands AL2 - z is 1.  The preferred combination for monodentate ligands is y equal to 1 or 2 and z equal to 1.  The preferred combination for bidentate or tridentate ligands is y equal to 1 and z equal to 1.<br>
The indium, copper, gallium, silver, palladium, rhodium, gold, platinum, bismuth, yttrium and lanthanide radiopharmaceuticals of the present invention can be easily prepared by admixing a salt of a radionuclide and a reagent of the present invention, in an aqueous solution at temperatures from 0 to 100 °C.  These radionuclides are typically obtained as a dilute aqueous solution in a mineral acid, such as hydrochloric, nitric or sulfuric acid.  The radionuclides are combined with from one to about one thousand equivalents of the reagents of the present invention dissolved in aqueous solution.  A buffer is typically used to maintain the pH of the reaction mixture between 3 and 10.<br>

Utility<br>
The pharmaceuticals of the present invention are useful for imaging angiogenic tumor vasculature, therapeutic cardiovascular angiogenesis, and cardiac pathologies associated with the expression of vitronectin receptors in a patient or for treating cancer in a patient.  The radiopharmaceuticals of the present invention comprised of a gamma ray or positron emitting isotope are useful for imaging of pathological processes involving angiogenic neovasculature, including cancer, diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration, restenosis of blood vessels after angioplasty, and wound heAL1ng, as well as atherosclerotic plaque, myocardial reperfusion injury, and myocardial ischemia, stunning or infarction.  The radiopharmaceuticals of the present invention comprised of a beta, alpha or Auger electron emitting isotope are useful for treatment of pathological processes involving angiogenic neovasculature, by delivering a cytotoxic dose of radiation to the locus of the angiogenic neovasculature. The treatment of cancer is affected by the systemic administration of the radiopharmaceuticals resulting in a cytotoxic radiation dose to tumors.<br>
The compounds of the present invention comprised of one or more paramagnetic metal ions selected from gadolinium, dysprosium, iron, and manganese, are useful as contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of pathological processes involving angiogenic neovasculature,  as well as atherosclerotic plaque, myocardial reperfusion injury, and myocardial ischemia, stunning or infarction.<br>
The compounds of the present invention comprised of one or more heavy atoms with atomic number of 2 0 or greater are useful as X-ray contrast agents for X-ray<br>
imaging of pathological processes involving angiogenic neovasculature,  as well as atherosclerotic plaque, myocardial reperfusion injury, and myocardial ischemia, stunning or infarction.<br>
The compounds of the present invention comprised of an echogenic gas containing surfactant microsphere are useful as ultrasound contrast agents for sonography of pathological processes involving angiogenic neovasculature,  as well as atherosclerotic plaque, myocardial reperfusion injury, and myocardial ischemia, stunning or infarction.<br>
Representative compounds of the present invention were tested in the following in vitro assays and in vivo models and were found to be active.<br>
Immobilized Human Placental avb3 Receptor Assay<br>
The assay conditions were developed and vAL1dated using [1-125]vitronectin.  Assay vAL1dation included Scatchard format analysis (n=3) where receptor number (Bmax) and Kd (affinity) were determined.  Assay format is such that compounds are preliminarily screened at 10 and 100 nM final concentrations prior to IC50 determination.  Three standards (vitronectin, anti-avB3 antibody, LM609, and anti-avB5, P1F6) and five reference peptides have been evaluated for IC50 determination. Briefly, the method involves immobilizing previously isolated receptors in 96 well plates and incubating overnight.  The receptors were isolated from normal, fresh, non-infectious (HIV, hepatitis B and C, syphilis, and HTLV free) human placenta.  The tissue was lysed and tissue debris removed via centrifugation.  The lysate was filtered.   The receptors were isolated by affinity chromatography using the immobilized avb3 antibody.  The<br>
plates are then washed 3x with wash buffer.  Blocking buffer is added and plates incubated for 12 0 minutes at room temperature.  During this time compounds to be tested and [1-125]vitronectin are premixed in a reservoir plate.  Blocking buffer is removed and compound mixture pipetted.  Competition is carried out for 60 minutes at room temperature.  Unbound material is then removed and wells are separated and counted via gamma scintillation.<br>
Oncomouse® Imaging<br>
The study involves the use of the c-Neu Oncomouse® and FVB mice simultaneously as controls.  The mice are anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital and injected with approximately 0.5 mCi of radiopharmaceutical. Prior to injection, the tumor locations on each Oncomouse® are recorded and tumor size measured using cAL1pers.  The animals are positioned on the camera head so as to image the anterior or posterior of the animals.  5 Minute dynamic images are acquired serially over 2 hours using a 256x256 matrix and a zoom of 2x.  Upon completion of the study, the images are evaluated by circumscribing the tumor as the target region of interest (ROI) and a background site in the neck area below the carotid sAL1vary glands.<br>
This model can also be used to assess the effectiveness of the radiopharmaceuticals of the present invention comprised of a beta, alpha or Auger electron emitting isotope.  The radiopharmaceuticals are administered in appropriate amounts and the uptake in the tumors can be quantified either non-invasively by imaging for those isotopes with a coincident imageable gamma emission, or by excision of the tumors and counting the amount of radioactivity present by standard<br>
techniques.  The therapeutic effect of the radiopharmaceuticals can be assessed by monitoring the rate of growth of the tumors in control mice versus those in the mice administered the radiopharmaceuticals of the present invention.<br>

This model was adapted from a matrigel model intended for the study of angiogenesis in mice. Matrigel (Becton &amp; Dickinson, USA) is a basement membrane rich in laminin, collagen IV, entactin, HSPG and other growth factors.  When combined with  growth factors such as bFGF [50 0 ng/ml] or VEGF [2 ug/ml] and injected subcutaneously into the mid-abdominal region of the mice, it solidifies into a gel and stimulates angiogenesis at the site of injection within 4-8 days. In the rabbit model, New Zealand White rabbits (2.5-3.0 kg) are injected with 2.0 ml of matrigel, plus 1 ug bFGF and 4 ug VEGF.  The radiopharmaceutical is then injected 7 days later and the images obtained.<br>

Canine Spontaneous Tumor Model<br>
Adult dogs with spontaneous mammary tumors were sedated with xylazine (20 mg/kg)/atropine (1 ml/kg). Upon sedation the animals were intubated using ketamine (5 mg/kg)/diazepam (0.25 mg/kg) for full anethesia. Chemical restraint was continued with ketamine (3 mg/kg)/xylazine (6 mg/kg) titrating as necessary.  If required the animals were ventilated with room air via an endotrachael tube (12 strokes/min, 25 ml/kg) during the study.  Peripheral veins were catheterized using 2 0G<br>
I.V. catheters, one to serve as an infusion port for compound while the other for exfusion of blood samples. Heart rate and EKG were monitored using a cardiotachometer (Biotech, Grass Quincy, MA) triggered from a lead II electrocardiogram generated by limb leads.  Blood samples are generally taken at -10 minutes (control), end of infusion, (1 minute), 15 min, 30 min, 60 min, 90 min, and 120 min for whole blood cell number and counting.  Radiopharmaceutical dose was 300 uCi/kg adminitered as an i.v. bolus with sAL1ne flush. Parameters were monitored continuously on a polygraph recorder (Model 7E Grass) at a paper speed of 10 mm/min or 10 mm/sec.<br>
Imaging of the laterals were for 2 hours with a 256x256 matrix, no zoom, 5 minute dynamic images.  A known source is placed in the image field (20-90 uCi) to evaluate region of interest (ROI) uptake.  Images were also acquired 24 hours post injection to determine retention of the compound in the tumor.  The uptake is determined by taking the fraction of the total counts in an inscribed area for ROI/source and multiplying the known uCi.  The result is uCi for the ROI.<br>

Cardiovascular disease models that can be used to assess the diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals, magnetic resonance, X-ray and ultrasound contrast agents of the present invention are reviewed in J. Nucl. Cardiol., 1998, 5, 167-83.  There are several well established rabbit models of atherosclerosis; one model produces predominantly proliferating smooth muscle cells by<br><br>
balloon deendotheliAL1zation of infradiaphragmatic abdominal aorta to simulate restenotic lesions; another model that produces simulated advanced human atherosclerotic plaque by balloon deendotheliAL1zation followed by a high cholesterol diet.<br>
A model of congestive heart failure is described in Am. J. Physiol., 1998, 274, H1516-23.  In general, Yorkshire pigs are randomly assigned to undergo 3 wks of rapid atrial pacing at 240 beats/min. or to be sham controls. The pigs are chronically instrumented to measure left ventricular function in the conscious state.  The pigs are anesthetized.<br>
A shielded stimulating electrode is sutured onto the left atrium, connected to a modified programmable pace maker and buried in a subcutaneous pocket.  The pericardium is closed loosely, the thoracotomy is closed, and the pleural space is evacuated of air. After a recovery period of 7-10 days, the pacemaker is activated in the animals selected to undergo chronic rapid pacing.  The animals are sedated, the pacemaker is deactivated (pacing groups only.  After a 30 min stabilization period, indexes of LV function and geometry are determined (by echocardiography as a control) by injecting the radiolabeled compound.  For biodistribution, the animals are anesthetized, the heart extirpate and the LV apex and midventricular regions are evaluated.<br>
