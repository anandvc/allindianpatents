				<td>Process for the preparation of latices<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of latices by batchwise radical polymerization of one or more monomers.<br>
everal processes for the preparation of latices by batchwise radical polymerization are known to a person skilled in the art.<br>
First of all, it is known to prepare latices by batchwise radical polymerization in non-micellar emulsion with the participation of a water-soluble initiator, optionally with the participation of a seed latex. This process for the preparation of latices is such that the compositions and the articles prepared from the latices or resins obtained by drying the latter and then by milling the dry products have poor properties, in particular a low thermal stability and a pronounced starting coloration. In addition, if the emulsion polymerizations are carried out without seed latex:<br>
-	elementary   particles   are   created   during   the<br>
polymerization according to very complex mechanisms<br>
which are difficult to control<br>
-	the  elementary  particles  of  the  polymer(s)  thus<br>
prepared  are  all  small  in  size;  the  latices<br>
comprising such elementary polymer particles and the<br>
plastisol compositions comprising the polymer resins<br>
prepared by drying such latices and then by milling<br>
the dry products have a very high viscosity.<br>
In addition, if non-micellar emulsion polymerizations are carried out with the participation of a seed latex:<br>
-	elementary  particles  are  nevertheless   generally<br>
created   during   the   polymerization,   with   the<br>
abovementioned disadvantages<br>
c<br><br>
- ipso facto, it is necessary to prepare the said seed latex; in point of fact, the preparation of appropriate seed latices is complex in itself.<br>
Subsequently, it is known to prepare latices by batchwise radical microsuspension polymerization with the participation of oil-soluble initiator(s) included in a fine monomer dispersion. This process for the preparation of latices is such that the compositions and articles prepared from the latices or from the resins obtained by drying the latter and by then milling the dry products have, taken as a whole, better properties than the compositions and articles prepared from the latices and resins obtained by processes for the preparation of latices according to which the latices are prepared by batchwise radical emulsion polymerization, as described above. However, this process for the preparation of latices has a major disadvantage: this process is such that the latices prepared according to it have a poor mechanical stability; in order to improve the mechanical stability of such latices, it is necessary to reduce the amount of monomer(s) employed in the polymerization, leading to low productivity.<br>
Finally, patent US 4,245,070 discloses a process for the preparation of latices of a vinyl chloride polymer by batchwise radical "special microsuspension" polymerization with the participation of a seed latex comprising an oil-soluble initiator (hereinafter denoted LB*), of one or more seed latices not comprising initiator and, also, preferably, with the participation of a complex activating agent. According to this process for the preparation of latices, no fine monomer dispersion is introduced into the polymerization medium. This process for the preparation of latices has numerous disadvantages:<br>
- this process employs, in the polymerization, a seed latex LB* which is extremely difficult to prepare,<br><br>
store and handle: (a) with regard to the preparation of LB : the removal of the residual LB* monomer has to be carried out under mild conditions, so as not to destroy the undecomposed initiators; (b) with regard to the storage and handling of LB*: very specific precautions are needed, in particular the maintenance of a sufficiently low storage temperature and the absence of contact with the atmosphere<br>
this process, when it employs an activating agent under the form of a complex in the polymerization, is usually such that the compositions and articles prepared from the latices or from the resins obtained by drying the latter have poor properties, in particular a low thermal stability and a pronounced initial coloration<br>
this process, when it does not employ, in the polymerization, an activating agent under the form of a complex plus the LB* latex in a high amount, is such that the duration of the polymerization is extremely long (18 hours, according to Example 1 of the patent} .<br>
A subject-matter of the present invention is a process for the preparation of latices by batchwise radical polymerization of one or more monomers which makes it possible simultaneously to benefit from all the advantages of the processes of the prior art and to avoid all the disadvantages thereof.<br>
To this end, the invention relates to a process for the preparation of latices by batchwise radical polymerization of one or more monomers, characterized in that it involves, in the polymerization:<br>

have an extremely high mechanical stability (even if<br>
their dry matter content is greater than 50%)<br>

resins  which  make  possible  the  preparation  of<br>
compositions  and  articles  which  have  excellent<br>
properties, in particular a high thermal stability, a<br>

The reactor was closed and the stirrer was switched on. A vacuum was produced in the reactor.<br><br>
9.b.0 kg of vinyl chloride were introduced into the reactor.<br>
The contents of the reactor were brought to 51°C. Once this temperature was reached, 2.38 1 of a 40.0 g/1 aqueous ammonia solution were introduced into the reactor. Subsequently, 500 cm3 of a 66.5 g/1 aqueous ammonium persulphate solution were introduced into the reactor (this point is conventionally denoted by "to") -<br>
During the polymerization, 7.34 kg of a 180 g/kg aqueous tetrapropylbenzene sulphonate solution were introduced into the reactor.<br>
When a fall in pressure is detected, i.e., in the case which concerns us, at t0 + 378 min, the contents of the reactor were brought to a higher temperature and a treatment for purification from residual vinyl chloride was carried out.<br>
The latex was emptied from the reactor. The latex was filtered through a sieve with a mesh spacing of 1 mm. The latex was introduced into a storage tank. Finally, 25.0 1 of demineralized water were,added to the latex.<br>
A sample of latex was withdrawn from the	storage tank<br>

The reactor was closed and the stirrer was switched on. A vacuum was subsequently p r o d u c e d i n the reactor.<br>
Preparation of the fine; dispersion (2nd part) . 46.0 kg of vinyl chloride were introduced into the mixing autoclave and vigorous stirring was maintained therein in order to form therein an "ordinary" homogeneous aqueous dispersion of droplets of vinyl chloride comprising the oil-soluble initiators and the peak suppressant .<br>

Preparation __o_f _ _the __ fine  dispersion  (3rd part)  and D.'3__ ^J?^— reactants to the reactor  (3rd part). A<br>
high-pressure homogenizer connecting the mixing autoclave to the reactor was brought into service. The homogenization pressure was adjusted. The contents of<br><br>
the mixing autoclave were transferred into the reactor via this homogenizer. The operating conditions of the homogenizer were such that, at the outlet of the latter, a fine aqueous dispersion of vinyl chloride droplets comprising the oil-soluble initiators and the peak suppressant was obtained.<br>
Polymerization. The contents of the reactor were brought to 51°C. Once this temperature was reached, 1.25 1 of a 32.7 g/1 aqueous ammonia solution were introduced into the reactor.<br>
During polymerization, 42.0 kg of vinyl chloride were introduced into the reactor.<br>
Once the fall in pressure (AP = 1 bar) was detected, the time which had passed since t0 was recorded and the contents of the reactor were brought to a higher temperature.<br>
Finishing operations. A treatment for purification from residual vinyl chloride was carried out.<br>
The latex was emptied and the reactor was cleaned out.<br>
The wet deposit present inside the reactor, in particular on its walls and on the blades of the stirrer, was collected. After weighing, the wet deposit was dried in an oven. The dry deposit was weighed in its turn.<br>

distribution of the elementary particles thereof was measured by sedimentometry.<br>
Drying _the	latex and recovery of the resin. The balance<br>
of the latex was dried by atomization. The dry resin formed from vinyl chloride polymer was recovered and was milled. Finally, the K number of the polymer was measured according to ISO Standard 1628-2.<br>
Results of the determinations. The duration of the polymerization from t0 to AP = 1 bar was 363 min.<br>
The amount of wet deposit which was collected inside the reactor had a value of 2.82 kg. The amount of dry deposit had a value of 0.76 kg.<br>
The amount of wet lumps had a value of 3. 6 kg. The amount of dry lumps had a value of 1.95 kg.<br>
The dry matter content of the latex had a value of 50.6%.<br>
The distribution of the elementary particles of the polymer of the latex was as follows: bimodal distributi on comprising:<br>
-	approximately 83% by weight of a family of "large"<br>
elementary particles with a broad distribution with a<br>
weight-average diameter of approximately 0.83 (Jjn<br>
-	approximately 17% by weight of a family of "fine"<br>
elementary  particles  with  a  relatively  narrow<br>
distribution  with  a  weight-average  diameter  of<br>
approximately 0.16 p,m.<br>
The K number of the vinyl chloride polymer had a value of 72.2.<br>

-	seed latex was not introduced into the reactor<br><br>
-	the  amounts  ot  demineralized  water  which  were<br>
introduced into the mixing autoclave,  on  the one<br>
hand, and into the reactor, on the other hand, each<br>
had a value of 56.8 kg<br>
-	the amount of vinyl chloride which was introduced<br>
into the reactor during polymerization had a value of<br>
48.6 kg.<br>
The amounts of demineralized water and of vinyl chloride were corrected with respect to Example 1, so that the maximum accessible dry matter content (corresponding to a theoretical degree of conversion of 100%) was identical for the 2 tests presented as examples.<br>
the  test   and  results   of   the The duration of the polymerization from to to AP = 1 bar was 402 min.<br>
The amount of wet deposit collected inside the reactor had a value of 5.80 kg. The amount of the dry deposit had a value of 1.19 kg.<br>
The latex was partially coagulated: it comprised an extremely high amount of lumps (greater than 20 kg), which lumps blocked the filter. The filtration had to be halted; the lumps could be quantified more accurately. The latex could not be dried by means of an atomizer-dryer.<br>
The distribution of the elementary particles of the latex (which was measured on a sample filtered beforehand) was unimodal: it comprised a family of "large" elementary particles with a broad distribution with a weight-average diameter of approximately 0.85 am.<br><br>
The K number of the vinyl chloride polymer (prepared by drying a sample of latex in an oven) had a value of 71.9.<br><br>
