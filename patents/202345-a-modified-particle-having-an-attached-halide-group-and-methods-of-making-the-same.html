				<td>A PARTICLE HAVING AN ATTACHED HALIDE GROUP AND METHODS OF MAKING THE SAME<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to particles, such as carbon black, having an attached halide containing radical which permits the formation of modified panicles having blocked radical sources. The present invention further relates to methods of preparing and using such modified particles.<br>
The role of carbon black as a thermal stabilizer in polymeric systems is discussed by W. L. Hawkins, R. H. Hansen, W. Matreyek, F. H. Winslow; 7. Applied Polymer Science, vol. 1. pages 37-42, 1959; J. T. Cmver, K. W. Rollmaim: J. Applied Polymer Science, vol. 8. pages 1169-83, 1964, and by G. Ivan, M. Giurgina: Revue Roumaine de Chemie, vol. 29, number 8, pages 639-646, 1984. In each discussion the mechanism is through phenolic and quinone oxygen groups on the carbon black surface behaving either as radical traps or peroxide decomposers. One skilled in the art, however, would consider these sites unavailable as initiating sites for polymerization processes.<br>
Belmont et al. (J. A. Belmont, J. M. Funt; International Rubber Conference, Essen, Germany, June 24-27 1991) identified the presence of peroxide groups, typically in the range 0.1 to 0.4 micromoles/sq meter, on the carbon black surface. However, the majority (greater than 80%) of the peroxide groups are thermally stable to heat treatment at 200°C and hence cannot be considered to be potential initiating sites for radical polymerization.<br>
Tsubokawa et al, (K. Fujiki, N. Tsubokawa, Y. Sone: Polymer J., vol. 22, number 8, pages 661-70, 1990, and N. Tsubokawa: Prog. Polymer Science, vol. 17, pages 417-70, 1992) discuss growing polymers from an activated carbon black surface by first attaching a reacdve group via the oxygen groups on the carbon black surface. Typical examples include the use of glycidyl methacrylate where the glycidyl group reacts with phenolic hydroxyl groups on the carbon black surface providing a vinyl functionality; the reaction of 4,4* azo bis-{4-cyanovaieric acid) whereby the isocyanate group reacts with phenolic hydroxyl groups and subsequent heating decomposes the azo group to generate an alkyl radical; and the reaction of the phenolic hydroxyl groups with butyl lithium which can then be used as an initiation site for anionic polymerization.<br>
All of these approaches require the presence of oxygen groups on the carbon black surface. Since the level of reactive hydroxyl and carboxylic acid groups, relative to the above approaches, present on a typical furnace or thermal carbon black is typically 0.01 to 0.1<br><br>
micromoles/sq meter, the number of potential initiation sites is quite low.<br>
Further, subsequent polymerization from these activated sites will most likely occur in the normal manner for free radical polymerization with the chains being irreversible terminated by chain combination reactions, combination with unreacted oxygen groups on the carbon black surface, and/or the addition of chain stoppers. In all cases the polymerization cannot be reiniuated. Accordingly, there is a need to provide modified particles which overcome the above-described limitations.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
In one embodiment, the present invention relates to a modified panicle comprising a particle having attached a group having the formula:<br><br><br>
wherein R1is an alkyl or alkylene group or an aiyl or arylene group; R1and R\ which can be the same or different, represent hydrogen, an alkyl group, an aryl group. -0R1-NHR1-NR1\ or SR\ wherein R1which can be the same or different, represents an alkyl group or an aryl group; and Q represents a labile halide containing radical.<br>
The particle, to be modified, can be any particle capable of having a group represented by any one of the formulas described herein attached thereto, such as formula (IHIV). Preferably, the particle has a carbon reactive site (C-), since in a preferred embodiment for the groups of formula (I) and (III). -Q and -X-Q are preferably attached through a carbon bond on the particle. The particle, for instance, can be carbon products, colored pigments other than carbon products, metal oxides (e.g.. silica), metal hydroxides, multiphase aggregates comprising a carbon phase and a silicon-containing species phase, multi-phase aggregates comprising a carbon phase and a metal-containing species phase, and the like. The carbon may be of the crystalline and/or amorphous type. Examples of carbon products include, but are not limited to. graphite, carbon black, vitreous carbon, activated charcoal, activated carbon, carbon fiber, and mixmres thereof. Finely divided forms of the above are preferred. Most preferably, the particle is a carbon product, and most preferably carbon black.<br>
The multi-phase aggregate containing the carbon phase and the silicon-containing species phase can also be considered a silicon-treated carbon black aggregate and the multiphase aggregate containing a carbon phase and a metal-containing species phase can be considered to be a metal-treated carbon black aggregate as long as one realizes that in either case, the silicon-containing species and/or metal-containing species are a phase of the aggregate<br><br>
just like the carbon phase. The multi-phase aggregates do not represent a niixture of discrete carbon black aggregates and discrete silica or metal aggregates and is not a silica coated carbon black. Rather, the multi-phase aggregates used in the present invention include at least one silicon-containing or metal-
The aggregate, thus contains at least two phases, one of which is carbon and the other of which is a silicon-containing species, a metal-containing species, or both. The silicon-containing species that can be a pan of the aggregate is not attached to a carbon black aggregate like a silica coupling agent, but actually is pan of the same aggregate as the carbon phase. For instance, when die multi-phase aggregate having a carbon phase and a silicon-containing species phase is examined under STEM-EDX, the silicon signal corresponding to the silicon-containing species is found to be present in individual carbon black aggregates. By comparison, for example, in a physical mixture of silica and carbon black, STEM-EDX examination reveals distincdy separate silica and carbon black aggregates.<br>
The metal-treated carbon blacks are aggregates containing at least a carbon phase and a metal-containing species phase. The metal-containing species include compounds containing aluminum, zinc, magnesium, calcium, titanium, vanadium, cobalt, nickel, zirconium, tin. antimony, chromium, neodymium. lead, tellurium, barium, cesium, iron, and molybdenum. Preferably, the metal-containing species phase is an aluminum- or zinc-containing species phase. The metal-containing species phase can be distributed through at least a portion of the aggregate and is an inu-insic part of the aggregate.<br>
Further, it is widiin the bounds of the present invention to have a metal-treated carbon black containing more than one type of metal-containing species phase or the metal-treated carbon black can also contain a silicon-containing species phase and/or a boron-containing species phase. For example, the metal-treated carbon black of the present invention can have an aggregate comprising a carbon phase, an aluminum-containing species phase, and a zinc-containing species phase. Accordingly, the multi-phase aggregates used in the present invention can have two or more different types of metal-containing species phases and/or additional non-metal species phases.<br>
Preferably, for purposes of the present invention, the amount of elemental silicon and/or elemental metal present in the multi-phase aggregate is from about 0.1 to about 25 wt. %, more preferably, from about 0.5 wt. % to about 10 wt. %, and most preferably from about 0.2 wt. % to about 5.4 wt. %, by weight of the aggregate.<br><br>

When the particle is a multi-phase aggregate, like a carbon phase and a silicon-containing species phase, preferably the group of formula (I) or (III) is attached at least, if not .exclusively, on the carbon phase.<br><br>
With regard to the aromatic group, any aromatic group may be used. Unlike the polymerizable monomer discussed later, the aromatic group is not a polymer and is not polymerized. Examples include, but are not limited to, arylene groups. Preferred aryiene groups include, but are not limited to, phenylene and naphthalene groups. The aromatic group includes, but is not limited to, unsaturated cyclic hydrocarbons containing one or more rings. The aromatic group may be substituted or unsubstituted.

Preferably, the alkyl group is a Ci-O alkyl group. Examples of aryl groups include, but are not limited to, phenyl, biphenyl, and naphthyl. The alkyl and aryl groups mentioned here as well as the arylene and alkylene groups mentioned throughout can be unsubstituted or substituted for purposes of the present invention. R1can be the same type of alkyl and aryl groups mentioned above with respect to R1and RThe labile halide containing group which is substituted or attached to the aromatic group as shown in formula (I) above, is a halide containing group wherein the labile halide {e.g., fluorine, bromine, iodine, chlorine) in the group is capable of forming an oxidized species with a transition metal halide. Preferably, the labile halide has a weak halide bond between the halide and the atom capable of forming the free radical. The labile halide is capable of undergoing chemical reaction resulting in the formation of the radical group which previously contained the labile halide. The group containing the labile halide in turn forms a radical which comprises a carbon atom, oxygen atom, nitrogen atom, sulfur atom, phosphorus atom, boron atom, and/or silicon atom. Other organic species or groups can be a part of the group containing the labile halide such as alkyl, aryl, and the like. Specific examples of the labile halide containing group include, but are not limited to, aryl halides, aryl alkyl halides, alkyl haiides, benzyl halides,<br><br>
arenesufonyl halides, phosphorous halides, haloallcyl esters, sulfur halides, silicon halides, arenecarbonyl halides, and other labile halide containing groups. A more specific example of a labile haiide containing group a bromo-or chloro-alkyl, such as bromoethyl, bromomethyl, bromo propyl and bromododecyl as well as the chloro versions of these groups which can form radicals. Another embodiment of the present invention relates to a modified panicle or aggregate having a group of formula (II) attached thereto. The panicle can be a metal oxide, a metal hydroxide, an aggregate comprising at least one carbon phase and a metal-containing species phase, or an aggregate comprising at least one carbon phase and at least one silicon-containing species phase. Attached to this particle or aggregate is a group having the formula:<br><br>
wherein CoupA represents a Si-containing group, a Ti-containing group, a Cr-containing group, or a Zr-containing group; R* and R1which can be the same or different, represent hydrogen, an alkyl group, an aryl group. -0R'1-NHR*°. -NR*'1'1or -SR'°, wherein R'° represents an alkyl group or an aryl group; Q represents a labile halide containing radical, and where n is an integer of from 1 to 3. Preferably, CoupA is attached to the particle or aggregate, especially in the case of a Si-containing group, via an oxygen radical which can form a pan of a CoupA.<br>
Examples of Si-containing groups include, but are not limited to, dimethylsilylmethyU dialkoxysiiylmethyU and the like. Examples of Ti-containing groups include, but are not limited to, alpha substituted ai-acetyl titanate and the like. Examples of Zr-containing groups include, but are not limited to, dialpha methoxy neopentylzirconate, aluminum zirconates and the like.<br>
Examples of die substituents R1and R' can be the same as the subsuments R1and R1mentioned above. Likewise, examples of the substiment R'** can be the same as the substituent R1discussed above. Also, the Q is the same as discussed above.<br>
The modified particles having the attached group of the formulas, such as formula (I), can be made in the following manner. A particle, such as carbon black, can first have a substituted or non-substituted aromatic or alkyl group attached to the panicle, wherein ttie aromatic or alkyl group is directly attached to the panicle. This attachment can be accomplished by the methods described in PCT International Application No. WO 96/18688 and U.S. Patent Nos. 5,851,280; 5,630,868; 5,559,169; 5,571,311; and 5,559.169 as well as<br><br>
U.S. Patent Application No. 08/572,525, all of which are hereby incorporated in iheir entireties by reference herein.<br>
The panicle having the attached aromatic or aikyl group can then react with -R'-CR1R1and then a labile halide containing radical source for a sufficient time and at a sufficient temperarure to form the modified particle having the attached group, like that of formula I. The labile halide containing radical source is present in amounts sufficient to react with -A-R'-CR1R1present on the particle. Preferably, the amount of the labile halide containing radical source is from about 0.01 mmoles/g (of particle) to about 10 mmoles/g and more preferably from about 0.01 to about 5 mmoles/g. Alternatively, the labile halogenating containing species can be formed by halogenation of a C-0 bond with a halogenating agent such as phosphorous tri-bromide.<br>
Alternatively, the modified particles of the present invention can be made by first forming the groups of the formulas described above, such as formula (I), Preferably, the labile haiide containing radical group is attached in the meta or para position of the aromatic group, if present. This group is then attached to the particle by a diazonium treatment in the manner described in the above referenced patents and patent applications, where a diazonium salt will first be formed containing a group of one of the formulas described above in the manner described in the above-referenced patents. The groups of the formulas can be then subsequently attached to the particle. In a less preferred way, the formulas of the present invention can be attached to the particle through a hydroxyl or carbonyl group present on the particle.<br>
Also, the modified panicle of the present invention can be formed by attaching a labile halide containing group containing at least one aikoxy silyl, aikoxy titanyl, or alkoxy zirconyl group to the particle which, in this particular process is preferably a metal oxide or metal hydroxide, or a carbon surface. This particular embodiment would attach a group of formula (ID or (IV) to a particle.<br>
In another process, the modified particle can be formed by first taking an aromatic or alkyl group and reacting it with R'CR1R1containing compound to form the groups of the formulas described above except for the presence of the -Q group. In other words, a group having the formula A-R'-CR"R1would first be formed and then the -Q group would be attached to this group to form a group of formula (I) of the present invention which can then be attached to the particle. In this process, R1and R1are preferably hydrogen.<br>
Alternatively, the process of making the modified particles of the present invention can<br><br>
be a three step process where A is first attached to the particle and then the group having the formula R1-C-R1R1can be attached to the aromatic or alkyl group. Then in a third step, the -Q can be attached to the R'-C-R1R1group.<br>
The modified particles of formula (II) can be made in the following manner. The aggregate comprising at least one carbon phase and at least one metal-containing species phase can be made as described in U.S. Patent Application No. 08/828,725. hereby incorporated herein by reference. The aggregate comprising at least one carbon phase and at least one metal containing species phase can be made as described in U.S. Patent No. 5,904,762 and 5,877,238. The aggregate or particle can then be reacted with a coupling agent by adding the coupling agent to the aggregate in a medium and mixing. Then, the aggregate or particle having the attached coupling group can be reacted with a labile halide containing radical source as described above.<br>
For purposes of the above-described reactions, the reaction should occur for a time and temperature sufficient to form the attached group onto the particle or aggregate. Generally, this time is from about 3 minutes to about 96 hours and more preferably from about 1 hour to about 24 hours-<br>
With the modified particles described above, polymers can be attached onto these attached groups by reacting these modified particles or aggregates with a polymerizable monomer such as a vinyl or diene containing monomer. Specific examples of such monomers include, but are not limited to, styene, isoprene, butadiene, chloromethylstyrene, methyl methacrylate, and butyl mcthacrylate, as well as acrylic acid and esters of acrylic acid and methacrylic acid and esters of methacrylic acid. More specific monomer examples include, but are not limited to, hydroxyalkyl (meth)acrylates, such as hydroxyethyl (meth)acrylaie, hydrox&gt;proyl (meth)acrylate; alkyl (meth)acrylates such as methyl acrylate or butyl acrylate; glycidyl (meth)acrylate; dimethylaminoethylacrylate; 2-acryl trimethyl ethylammonium chloride; aminoethyl acerylate; acrylonitirle; vinyl acetrate, and the like. Mixtures of two or more monomers can be also used or polymerized sequentially. If polymeric gels are described, then the monomer or ponion thereof is preferably a halide containing vinyl monomer or diene containing monomer (e.g., chloromethyl styrene or vinyl chloride).<br>
The polymerization reaction is conducted under conditions which permits the poiymerizadon of the monomer so that it forms a part of the attached group onto the panicle or aggregate. These conditions include ambient temperatures and can include preferably heating modified particles with a monomer above 80°C, preferably from about 120°C to about ISO'1'C, in the presence of a solvent, a transition metal halide, and a complexing ligand.  The reaction<br><br>
can be ended by lowering the temperature. The sequence of addition is not important and the particle (for instance Formula (I) or (III) complexing ligand, and transition metal halide can be added in any order. A preformed transition metal halide complex can alternatively be used in lieu of the separate components. In addition, complexing ligand and transition metaJ halide can first be reacted to form a complex or the reaction can occur in situ. The polymer-modified particle can then be subjected to distillation, steam stripping, or precipitation or other known methods in order to remove residual monomers and solvents. Examples of transition metal halides include, but are not limited to, copper (I) halides, and transition metal halides wherein the metal is copper, rhodium, iron, nickel, cobalt, palladium, and ruthenium. A specific and preferred example of the transition metal halide is copper (I) chloride. The complexing ligand can be any compound capable of complexing with the transition metal halide in order to be an efficient halide atom transfer promoter. Examples of the complexing ligand include, but are not limited to, 2,2'-bipyridine and derivatives thereof (e.g., alkyl substituted bipyridines), derivatives of uriphenyl phosphines, and muitidentate amines were the nitrogen atoms are preferably separated by ethylene or propylene units.<br>
The polymerization reaction thus can produce any length of polymer on the modified particle or aggregate. For example, polymers having average molecular weights, preferably ranging from about 500 to about 1,000,000 can be made. Other ranges of average molecular weights include, but are not limited to, from about 500 to about 3,000, and from about 500 to about 2,000, and firom about 500 to about 500,000, and from about 1,000 to about 250,000. The polymers can be any type, such as homopolymers, co-polymers, ter-polymers. or higher chain polymers. The polymers can also be block, graft, or random-type polymers. The polymers can be branched or unbranched. Polymers, such as comb polymers, can be formed or located off of the main polymer chain, and these polymers can be any type of polymer. Specific examples include, but are not limited to, polyamines. such as poiyethyleneimine or polyalkylene oxides, grafted onto the main polymer chain. The polymers that are formed can be ionic (e.g., canonic or anionic) or non-ionic polymers. Specific examples of polymers include, but are not limited to, polyamides, polyacrylics, polyvinylacetates, polyvinylalcohols. polyvinylpyridines, polyvinylpyrrilodones, polyvinylimidazoles, and acrylamides and derivatives thereof as well as combinations thereof<br>
Once the polymerizauon occurs, the modified particle will have a group attached<br>
having the formula:<br><br><br>
wherein the substituents are the same as described earlier for formula (I) and X is a polymer formed from at least one polymerizable monomer.<br>
Similarly, when the modified particle or aggregate having a group of formula (II) is polymerized by the introduction of one or more monomers, the group attached to the particle or aggregate will have the formula:<br>
wherein the substituents are the same as described in formula (II) and X is a polymer formed from at least one polymerizable monomer.<br>
