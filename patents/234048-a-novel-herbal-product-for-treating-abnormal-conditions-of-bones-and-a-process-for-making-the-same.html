THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a novel herbal product for treating abnormal conditions of bones and a process for making the same.<br>
More particularly, this invention relates to a herbal composition for treating fractures of bones and other conditions such as spondylitis, vertebral disc prolapse; for healing and promoting healthy bone structure and providing relief from pain in such conditions.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
For over 3000 years herbal therapies have addressed themselves to the fundamental principles of good health and longevity, based on the inherent ability of the human body to rejuvenate, to heal and to restore its natural balance. The herbal therapies do not have any harmful side effects but they have very effective healing properties.<br>
The term 'herb' can broadly be used to refer to the seeds, leaves, stems, flowers, roots, berries, bark, or any other plant parts that are used for healing.<br>
It is estimated that approximately 50 percent of the thousands of drugs commonly used and prescribed today are either derived from a plant source or contain chemical imitations of a plant compound. The popularity of herbal or herb based medicines are increasing because of less or no side effects / toxicity associated with them.<br>
Herbal medications are available in many forms, including capsules, tablets, or coated tablets, pellets, extracts or tinctures, powders, fresh or dried plants or plant parts, prepared teas, juices, creams and ointments, essential oils or as combinations of any of these forms.<br>
Herbal medicines are administered by any one of various methods, including orally, rectally, transdermally, via feeding tubes, inhalation and the like.<br>
2<br><br>
This invention relates to a novel herbal product and a method of making the same using a combination of potent herbs for the treatment of bone related disorders.<br>
The bones of the body form the human frame, or skeleton, which supports and protects the softer parts of the body. Bones are living tissues. They grow rapidly during one's early years, and renew themselves when they are broken.<br>
Bones have a center called the marrow, which is softer than the outer part of the bone. Bone marrow has cells that develop into red blood cells that carry oxygen to all parts of the body and into white blood cells that help fight disease. The outer part of the bones is formed of latticework structure comprising the minerals calcium and phosphorus. Because of their unique structure, bones can bear large amounts of weight and forces acting in different directions.<br>
However if the force applied on the bones is more than the bearing capacity, the bone or bones will break leading to a fracture.<br>
Fractures are very painful and make it difficult if not impossible to use the part of the body that is injured. A medical examination and x-rays are usually necessary to confirm and to ensure proper treatment.<br>
In the conventional therapies it is very important to control the movement of a broken bone. Moving a broken or dislocated bone can cause additional damage to the bone, nearby blood vessels, and nerves or other tissues surrounding the bone. Improper healing of a fracture may also lead to permanent deformity.<br>
The severity of a fracture usually depends on the force that caused the fracture. If the bone's breaking point has been exceeded only slightly, then the bone may crack rather than breaking all the way through. If the force is extreme, the bone may shatter. If the bone breaks in such a way that bone fragments stick out through the skin or a wound penetrates down to the broken bone, the fracture is called an "open" fracture. This type of fracture is<br>
3<br><br>
particularly serious because once the skin is broken, infection in both the wound and the bone can occur.<br>
Fractures can result because of an accidental injury or due to decrease in the mineral density of the bones, which is called osteoporosis. Bone resorption, when exceeding bone formation, can lead to bone fractures resulting from minimal trauma.<br>
Spondylitis (also called ankylosing spondylitis) is a type of arthritis that affects the spine or backbone. Spondylitis may cause back pain and stiffness. The bones of the spine, called vertebrae, may grow or fuse together resulting in a rigid spine. These changes may be mild or severe. Severe disease may lead to poor posture and deformities. Early diagnosis and treatment helps control pain and stiffness, and may reduce or prevent significant deformity.<br>
The most common early signs of spondylitis are constant pain and stiffness in the low back, buttocks and hips that continue for more than three months. Spondylitis often starts around the sacroiliac joints where the sacrum (the lowest major part of the spine) joins the ilium of the pelvic bone. Spondylitis can cause an overgrowth of the bones, which may lead to abnormal joining of parts that are normally separate. This is called bony "fusion."<br>
Fusion affecting bones of the neck, back or hips may impair a person's ability to perform routine activities. Fusion of the ribs to the spine or breastbone may limit a person's ability to expand his or her chest when taking a deep breath. Spondylitis may also affect some of the ligaments and tendons that attach to bones leading to tendonitis.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
The conventional way of treating various types of fractures is by one or more of the following ways:<br>
Ø	Cast immobilization-A plaster or fiberglass cast is the most common type of fracture treatment, because most broken bones can heal successfully once they have<br>
4<br><br>
been repositioned and a cast has been applied to keep the broken ends in proper position while they heal.<br>
Ø	Functional cast or brace-The cast or brace allows limited or "controlled" movement of nearby joints. This treatment is desirable for some but not all fractures.<br>
Ø	Traction-Traction is usually used to align a bone or bones by a gentle, steady pulling action. The pulling force may be transmitted to the bone through skin tapes or a metal pin through a bone. Traction may be used as a preliminary treatment, before other forms of treatment.<br>
Ø	Open reduction and internal fixation-In this type of treatment, an orthopedist must perform surgery on the bone. During this operation, the bone fragments are first repositioned (reduced) into their normal alignment, and then held together with special screws or by attaching metal plates to the outer surface of the bone. Inserting rods down through the marrow space in the center of the bone may also hold the fragments together. These methods of treatment can reposition the fracture fragments very exactly. Because of the risks of surgery, however, and possible complications, such as infection, they are used only when the orthopedic surgeon considers such treatment to be the only option to restore the broken bone to normal function.<br>
Ø	External fixation-In this type of treatment, pins or screws are placed into the broken bone above and below the fracture site. Then the orthopedic surgeon repositions the bone fragments. The pins or screws are connected to a metal bar or bars outside the skin. This device is a stabilizing frame that holds the bones in the proper position so they can heal. After an appropriate period of time, the external fixation device is removed.<br>
All trie above methods have shown consistent and good results but they are expensive and time consuming. They are associated with risks of surgery such as problems of anesthesia, infections, excessive bleeding and death.<br>
On removal of the cast or metal devices, there is stiffness of movement, which requires physiotherapy for a long time. Many times, the return to normal function is not complete.<br>
5<br><br>
There are inflammations and topical reactions under the cast or at the site of applications of the external devices.<br>
While a cure for spondylitis is not available, certain drugs help provide relief from pain and stiffness and allow patients to perform their exercises with minimal discomfort. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the most commonly used drugs for spondylitis treatment. In severe cases, other medications may be added to the treatment regimen.<br>
NSAIDs are however known to have several side effect e.g.:<br>
Gastrointestinal side effects such as gastritis or stomach ulcers;<br>
anti-clotting effects leading to bleeding or bruising easily. Large doses of NSAIDs can also<br>
lead to kidney problems and fluid retention, which can worsen congestive heart failure.<br>
NSAIDs can cause liver function test abnormalities, as well as ringing in the ears,<br>
headache, dizziness and drowsiness. Mouth sores and skin rashes also can occur while<br>
taking NSAIDs.<br>
Many herbal formulations have been used and recommended for the treatment of bone disorders such as fractures and inflammations.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,595,743 discloses herbal compositions which include licorice extract (Glycyrrhiza) and Siegesbeckia, Sophora, Stemonaa and Tetrandra herbs used for the treatment of various mammalian diseases, including inflammation and rheumatoid arthritis.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,683,697 discloses a pharmaceutical composition having anti-inflammatory, anti-pyretic activity wherein the composition includes plant parts from the species Melia, Angepica, Dendrobium, Impatiens, Citrus, Loranthus, Celosia, Cynanchum and Glehnia.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,683,698 discloses a herbal formulation comprising extracts of the roots, rhizomes, and/or vegetation of Alphinia, Smilax, Tinospora, Tribulus, Withania and Zingiber has been found to reduce or alleviate the symptoms associated with rheumatoid<br>
6<br><br>
arthritis, osteoarthritis, reactive arthritis and for reducing the production of proinflammatory cytokines.<br>
All the aforesaid herbs are exotic herbs not available in the Indian sub continent easily. Also their method of extraction as suggested are very complicated.<br>
Based on the foregoing, there currently exists a need for anti-inflammatory, analgesic herbal composition, which has low toxicity and few side effects.<br>
There is also a need for a simple home based, effective and comparatively inexpensive remedy for the treatment of fractures and spondylitis.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION:<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a herbal composition for healing and accelerating the rate of recovery from bone injuries like fracture and other bone affiliations like spondylitis.<br>
It is another object of this invention to provide a herbal composition having bone regenerating, anti-inflammatory, analgesic properties.<br>
It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a highly effective herbal formulation which has no toxicity and no side effects.<br>
Further object of this invention is to provide a simple home based, patient friendly, comparatively inexpensive remedy for the treatment of bone injuries like fracture and other bone affiliations like spondylitis.<br>
The novel compositions of the present invention fulfill these requirements.<br>

Used in boils and colic.<br>
It has been observed that the leaves of this plant when growing in the wild, are only eaten<br>
by goats and not by other animals such as cows.<br>
The references of the vegetable oils used in the medicinal preparation are as follows:<br>
Groundnut oil:<br>
Groundnut Oil is obtained from the plant Arachis hypogaea . The oil obtained is of pale yellow colour, with odour and taste reminiscent of the seeds. The relatively high content of arachidic, behenic and lignoceric acid (1-6%) is characteristic for Groundnut Oil. Groundnut Oil has high temperature stability and is used as a basic component for margarines. It is also registered in all major pharmacopoeias worldwide and used in many products and formulations of the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries.<br>
Sunflower oil:<br>
Sunflower oil is of vegetable origin from the plant Helianthus annum and is obtained from the fatty kernels of sunflowers. Cold-pressed crude oil is light yellow, hot-pressed crude oil has a brown color and refined oil is colorless. Sunflower oil is high-quality edible oil. The best oil is produced from shelled kernels.<br>
Sunflower oil is used as an edible oil and in margarine production. It ranks fourth most used vegetable oil in the World. Its pleasant taste and health giving properties have made it very popular in normal kitchens and food industry. It is very stable, light, neutral and has long shelf life without hydrogenation hence it has started getting preference over other vegetable cooking oils.<br>
14<br><br>
Safflower oil: An oily liquid extracted from the seeds of the safflower, Carthamus tinctorius. The safflower, which is a member of the thistle family, grows to a height of 4 feet and is topped by beautiful yellow, gold, and orange flowers. The seeds of the safflower are used for the production of safflower oil, which has the highest level of polyunsaturated fat of any edible oil. It is low in saturated fat so it is considered to be a healthy all-purpose oil.<br>
Uses: cooking, salad dressings, margarine production, used as a dietary supplement in the management of hypercholesterolemia.<br>
The reference for the Goat- Milk used in the medicinal preparation are as follows:<br>
Goat's milk has a reputation as being a highly digestible dairy product. This is due to the composition and structure of the lipid (fat) portion of goats milk and in part to the way the protein in goats milk reacts in the stomach as it starts to be digested. The food constituents of goat's milk contain excess of calcium and vary only a little from that of human milk. Goat's milk is sweet, cooling, astringent and constipating.<br>
It is very invigorating and promotes appetite and digestion. It is useful in, bile disorders, cough, chronic diarrhea and vomiting in children; variety of piles, bronchitis, and chronic cases of enlarged liver and spleen. In combination with barley gruel, it is recommended in dysenteric and diarrhea. Goat's milk is known for its hypo-allergenic properties. It has often been found that infants that are not able to tolerate mother's milk or cow's milk are able to drink goat's milk.<br>
Composition: Goat milk contains 4.5 grams of fat, 3.3 grams of protein and 71 Kcal of energy per 100 grams.<br>
Method of preparation :<br>
1) 8 to 12 gm of the bulbs of Garlic are peeled and ground to a fine paste.<br>
