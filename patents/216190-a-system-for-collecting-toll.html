				<td>The invention relates to a computerised toll collection system which is capable of covering the entire area of toll collection such as vehicle identification, classification of vehicles computation of toll and the associated monitoring and record keeping functions. The system is designed based on extensive studies carried out on the ergonomics of the entire functions of toll collection from approach of the vehicle to the toll booth, human actions involved in toll payment and collections and the exit of the vehicle.<br>
Toil collection systems in use at present have not changed radically over the years from what they were at their inception. Recently there have been various trials of systems utilizing changes in the toll collection technology. The principle intent of all toll collection systems is to device means of achieving speedy movement of traffic at the tollbooths without sacrificing any toll revenue. Toll booths are a major factor in slowing down the constant flow of traffic. They are often the source of long delays. To avoid this traffic delay and to smoothen the flow of traffic, various systems have been generated and put on trial. Host of these systems are oriented towards improving the stop over to pay toll time at the toll booths. They are not oriented towards the vehicle driver who is a key factor of this system.<br>
Most of the present systems on trial are based on achieving a "Cashless" transaction at the toll booths. This requires prepayment of an amount before using the toll facility. In reality this transfers the "time" required at the toll booth to the transaction time required for carrying out the prepayment.<br>
Toll collection systems have been using smart cards and E-2 passes which are prepaid. However these systems have the inherent disadvantages such as creating traffic jams due to one of the vehicles in the line having not enough credit on its card. It can also create safety problems and frustration to the drivers who have valid prepaid cards. Even though technological developments in the field of toll collection have led<br><br><br>
to various electronic toll collection systems they are not user friendly and often create system outages.<br>
The computerised toll collection system according to the invention achieves an improvement on the present system of toll collection. It formulates a via media between traffic oriented and user-friendly systems, It is economically viable and generates additional revenue, in the form of less overall expense, It also improves upon the present toll collection system and modifies the applicability of advance technology to make it more user friendly and less prone to outages.<br>
The computerised toll collection system according to the invention uses a post payment card on which information can be written and read using a reader cum writer. Through out the specification and claims that follow the post payment card used in the system according to the invention will be referred to as "NICE card" and the reader CUT writer of these NICE card will be referred to as "NICE card reader cum writer" .<br>
The NICE card is similar to a plastic credit card or ATM card. NICE card can have either magnetic strip or semiconductor microchip for storing information written on it. The information can be written and read from the NICE card using a NICE card reader cum writer. The technology of making such cards and such reader cum writer are well known and is not the subject of this invention. A set of NICE cards are used in the computerised toll collection system according to the invention and they are recycled for repeated use. The information on these NICE cards can be erased before new information is written on them by the NICE card reader cum writer.<br>
The invention provides a computerised system for collecting toll comprising at least two toll booths at entry point and exit point with entry and exit barriers, each said toll booth comprising stack of NICE card for writing data on it and reading data therefrom, a NICE card reader cum writer for reading and writing data from and on the NICE card, the output of the NICE card writer cum reader being connected to a computer with a CPU, a key board and a monitor, an actuating mechanism connected for operating the barriers in response to a command signal from the computer and a<br><br>
wide area network interface through which the computers in each toll booth and a central control console are connected in a wide area network.<br>
An optical cable network or a wireless network may be used connecting the computers in each toll booth and the central control console in a wide area network.<br>
Preferably a close circuit television network is connected in the wide area network for more accurate monitoring. An emergency telephone console may be provided with the wide area network for emergency contact.<br>
In a preferred embodiment an automatic barrier gate is used to enforce and to prevent violation, of vehicles from leaving the toll without paying the necessary toll. A low power heavy-duty high output instant reverse motor drives the gate arms. Alarm may be provided on breakages or unauthorized removal of the gate or gate arm. Toll collection terminal or toll booth at the exit point is the heart of the entire system. The toll booth operator at the exit point simply swipes or passes the NICE card onto the NICE card reader curnwriter to record the vehicles entry and to compute the toll fee. It is desirable to have an indoor and outdoor fee display panel to show the amount that the vehicle driver has to pay. Each terminal is provided with software functions needed for an efficient toll system operation. Its modular design allows the system for expansion in future and to suit specific local requirements. A video monitoring system is installed at each lane to safeguard against fraud and to enhance data security for toll operations. All information captured on video is displayed on a central monitor located at a central control console. The information is stored in a 24-hour time lapse recorder. Each toll terminal is networked into the central computer, When a vehicle approaches a lane, the operator identifies its class and assigns a corresponding numeric code. This can be replaced or verified with the information automatically generated by a vehicle classifier. A character generator superimposes or overlays the vehicle classes keyed-in by the operator on the video display for supervisor verification. This is viewed on a monitor located at the central control console. The toll fee paid by the vehicle operator is calculated based on the entry point<br><br>
arid the class of vehicle. The information regarding the class of vehicle is manually entered by the operator may lead to incorrect information. This may be due to fraudulent transaction by a delinquent operator or due to an oversight is entering. To have a consistent and accurate classification it is necessary to classify the vehicles automatically through a computerized classification system.<br>
Automatic vehicle classifier (AVC) uses the vehicle height and the number of axles to distinguish and classify the vehicle. As the vehicle enters the toll lane, the AVC determines the class independently of the operator. When the operator keys-in the classification AVC verifies the information to cross check it with the one read by it. Any difference triggers a violation alarm to alert the supervisor at the central control console.<br>
The computerised toll collection system according to the invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings:<br>
Fig. 1 shows a toll booth at the entry point according to the invention. Fig. 2 shows a toll booth at the exit point according to the invention.<br>
Fig. 3 shows the schematic diagram of a preferred toll booth according to the invention.<br>
Fig. 4 shows the schematic diagram of a preferred embodiment of the toll system according to the invention.<br>
The system comprises at least two toll booths (T) one at entry point and one at<br>
exit point. Plurality of toll booths (Ti,T2	Tn) are all interconnected in a wider area<br>
network.<br>
The toll booth at entry point comprises a stack of NICE cards (1) a NICE card reader cum writer (2) a computer with 8. CPU (3), a key board (4) and a monitor (5). The computer is connected to the NICE card reader cum writer (2) for reading and writing the NICE card through the computer. The computer is connected to a WAN<br><br>
interface (7). An automatic vehicle classifier (6) is provided at the entry point of the vehicle and the output of the classifier (8) is also connected to the computer data input. The vehicle classifier (8) uses an output generated by a sensor to catagorize the vehicle. The data stored in the computer and entered into the NICE card through the NICE card reader cum writer (2). The parameters for classifying vehicle are typically number of axels and/or number of tires of vehicles, vehicle dimensions and weight of the vehicle. A preferred sensor is a magentic loop embeded at the entry point to sense one or more parameters. A video camera may also be used for accurate classification if desired. An actuating device (6) operating in response to a command signal from the computer is used for operating a barrier (B) provided at the entry point. Signal light (10) is connected to indicate go/no go signals in accordance with the command signal from computer. Preferably line status indicator (12) may be provided at the entry point where multiple line entries are provided. The electric supply to the actuating device (6) and line status indicators (12) are provided through switches (1). When a vehicle reaches at the entry point, the operator in the toll booth encode a NICE card (1) by feeding information through the computer to the NICE card reader cum writer (2). The encoded NICE card is handed over to the driver of the vehicle and activates the actuating device (6) for opening the barrier (B). The barrier (B) closes automatically after sensing the movement of the vehicle.<br>
The toll booth at the exit point is also provided with a NICE card reader cum writer (2), a computer with a CPU (3), a key board (4) and a monitor (5). The computer is connected to the NICE card reader cum writer (2) for providing the date, to the computer from the encoded NICE card (1) received from the driver of the vehicle who reaches the exit point. The computer checks the data in the NICE card automatically for arty possible mistakes and the toll is calculated. The toll amount is displayed on a display (9) and the driver pays the toll amount to the operator. The amount collected is entered in the computer. An actuating device (6) is provided for operating in response to the command signal from the computer. The barrier (B) is opened by activating the actuating device (6) for the vehicle to pass through the exit. The computer is connected to the WAN through WAN interface (7).  The NICE card<br><br>
received at the exit toll booth can be reused by passing it to the tool booth at the entrance. The toll booth at the exit is also provided with go/no go signal light (10). The electric supply to the signal light (10) and to the status indicator (12) are provided through switches (11).<br>
