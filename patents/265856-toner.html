				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
TONER<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a toner used in electrophotography, image forming methods for visualizing electrostatic charge images  toner jet methods and the like.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
As image forming methods, many methods such as electrophotography, electrostatic recording, magnetic recording and toner jetting are convenrionally known. For example, the electrophotographic method generally involves forming electric latent images on a photosensitive member by any of various units, then developing the latent images with a toner, transferring the toner images to a transfer material such as paper as needed, and thereafter, fixing the toner images on the transfer material by heat, pressure or the like to obtain copies.  The remainder of the toner which is not transferred and left on the photosensitive member is cleaned by any of various methods to repeat the above-mentioned process.<br>
In recent years, the security function of copying machines and printers has become important<br><br>
along with the higher resolution and higher performance thereof.  For example, prevention of forgery and illegal copying of classified documents, certificates and the like is required and measures against illegal copy by embedded pattern printing and the like are taken.<br>
The embedded pattern printing is a technique in which when documents are printed hyl  a   copying machine or printer, an "embedded pattern" concealing character strings is simultaneously printed.  In the "embedded pattern", character strings such as "copying prohibited" are previously embedded so as to be hardly viewed and the embedded pattern has a mechanism in which one character strings stand cut on copying by a copying machine.  Since the embedded pattern printing utilizes a limit of the reproducible capability of dots in copying by a copying machine, a toner is demanded which is excellent in The density stability (density range), dot reproducibility, and line reproducibility, especially line width reproducibility and tailing occurring in line rear ends .<br>
Further, there are more opportunities to use copying machines and printers also in the fields of information recording due to a present sharp increase in information amount.  Typical media for information recording include barcode.  However, along with the<br><br>
expanded utilizing fields of the barcode, needs to record more inforination in smaller spaces increase and the so-called QR code (matrix type two-dimensional code), whereby code information is expressed two-dimensionally, is often used.  Since even if the QR code is copied several times by a copying machine, an accurate reading precision is required, a toner excellent in the dot reproducibility and the density stability (density range) is demanded.<br>
As described above, for obtaining the image quality adaptable to embedded pattern printing and QR code printing, image forming methods capable of providing higher resolution, higher speed ana longer durability are strongly desired in recent years, and therefore, the toner and others are demanded to be further improved.<br>
For example, with respect to the higher resolution, attempts as measures of the copying machine and printer body sides are made in which the high resolution of latent images is improved by reducing the laser spot diameter and raising the charging uniformity of a photosensitive member.  On the other hand, as measures of the toner side, attempts are made in which the reproducibility of latent images is improved, for example, by reducing the particle diameter of a toner for faithfully<br><br>
reproducing latent images having a high resolution. However, also in the case of a toner having a reduced particle diameter, since the toner particles move onto latent images in the state of the aggregating, the merit of reducing the particle diameter of the toner cannot be made the best use of and the improvement in the latent image reproducibility is difficult.<br>
Therefore, for obtaining an image quality of a higher resolution, less cohesion between toner particles is also required.<br>
In high speed development systems, since there is a fear of decrease in the image quality, toner perfcrraance adaptable to nigher speed is demanded.<br>
Efforts to solve the problems described above by measures from the toner side have been made, but the measures are not sufficient for achieving the highÂ¬speed and high resolution im.age formation demanded in recent years, and leave a room for improvement.<br>
For example, addition of various external additives to toner particles for the purpose of improving the chargeability of the toner and imparting a spacer function is proposed.  For example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. H05-142849, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. H05-224456 and Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2002-287410 propose that addition of a hydrophobic silica<br><br>
and a spherical silica to toner particles raises the image stability.  However, since the particle diameter and addition amount of the spherical silica as well as its interrelation with the toner particles are not fully optimized, embedding and release of the spherical silica easily occur in high speed development system; the toners are not sufficient for achieving the high-speed and high resolution image formation and leave a room for improvement,  Further, since the chargeability of the toners is not sufficient, the decrease in the image density and the fogging easily occur during a long duration.<br>
Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2002-â -ji213 proposes that addition of an amorphous fine silica powder to toner particles improves the chargeability of the toner and raises the image stability.  Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2002-108001 proposes the addition of a fine silica powder manufactured by the so-called sol-gel method to toner particles.  Although these methods can surely provide images excellent in the density and the fogging, since pores on the surface of the fine silica powder are not controlled, properties of the surface of the fine silica powder are liable to be nonuniform.  The toners adsorb moisture in the air under a high-humidity environment and the charging amount of the toners sometimes decreases.  Further, in<br><br>
the case of using the toners for high-speed development systems, since there is a case where the fine silica powder does not sufficiently function as a spacer, the toners have room for improvement in adaptability to the higher speed and higher resolution.  Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2004-334069 and Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. H06-019190 propose that addition of titanium oxide and aluminum oxide having been subj ected to hydrophobization to toner particles raises the chargeability of the toners.  Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2003-322998 proposes that addition of a fine inorganic powder whose particle :liameter is prescribed to toner particles raises -he image stability.  However, although these also have effects on the improvement in the chargeability of the toner and the stabilization of the image density, since the relation of the fine inorganic powder as additive particles with the toner particles is not optiinized, the toners are not sufficient in view of the higher image quality.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a toner whereby the above-mentioned problems are solved.  Specifically, it is an object of the present invention to provide a toner<br><br>
capable of stably providing a good density stability, line reproducibility and dot reproducibility in highÂ¬speed copying machines, printers and the like over a long period regardless of environments and providing an image quality adaptable to embedded pattern printing, QR code printing and the like.<br>
The above-mentioned object is accomplished by a constitution of the present invention described below.<br>
Specifically, the present invention relates to a toner which has toner particles including at least a binder resin and a colorant, and a fine silica powder, wherein the fine silica powder has a volume median diameter <d50 of not less than and more has a total pore volume measured in the range diameter from nm to cm></d50>
The fine silica powder has preferably an average pore diameter of not more than 50.0 nm.<br>
The toner preferably has a hydrophobic fine inorganic powder which has a BET specific surface area of not less than 50 m^/g and not more than 300 mVg.<br>
In the moisture adsorption-desorption isotherm at 30Â°C of the fine silica powder, the adsorbed moisture amount in the adsorption process at a relative humidity of 80%RH is preferably in the range<br><br>
from 0.01 to 1.00 mass%.<br>
The fine silica powder is preferably prepared by the gas phase method.<br>
According to the present invention, a toner capable of stably providing an excellent density stability, line reproducibility and dot reproducibility in high-speed copying machines, printers and the like which form high resolution latent images, over a long period regardless of environments and providing an image quality adaptable to embedded pattern printing, QR code printing and the like, can be provided.<br>
BEST MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
As a result of studies on constituting materials used for a toner, the present inventors have found that, in a toner which includes toner particles including at least a binder resin and a colorant, and a   fine silica powder, by controlling the particle diameter and the pores of the fine silica powder, the toner capable of stably providing an excellent density stability, line reproducibility and dot reproducibility in high-speed copying machines, printers and the like which form high resolution latent images, over a long period regardless of environments and providing an image quality adaptable to embedded pattern printing, QR code printing and<br><br>
the like, can be obtained.<br>
Specifically, the present invention is characterized in that, in a toner which includes toner particles including at least a binder resin and a colorant, and a fine silica powder, the fine silica powder has a volume median diameter (D50) of not less than 0.70 |j.m and not more than 3.00 ^m and has a total pore volume, measured in the range of the pore diameter from not less than 1.7 nm to not more than 300.0 nm, of not more than 0.200 cmVg.<br>
Many proposals are conventionally made in which a fine inorganic powder is added to toner particles for the purpose of raising the chargeability of the toner particles and imparting the spacer function thereto.  For effectively imparting the functions, the fine inorganic powder is required to have a high charging capability, a sharp particle diameter distribution and a uniform shape; among fine inorganic powders, especially fine silica powders meet these requirement performances, and are preferably used.<br>
However, since the fine surface structure and particle diameter of the fine silica powders are not sufficiently controlled, further improvements are needed to obtain a high resolution image quality of embedded pattern printing, QR code printing and the like.<br><br>
Since fine silica powders used for the toner application are commonly amorphous, and have many pores of the submicrometer order (several nanometers to several hundred nanometers) on their surface, the electrostatic charge is likely to become nonuni form. Particularly under a high-humidity environment, since water molecules in the air intrude the pores, the charging capability of a toner decreases during duration.  Consequently, since the chargeability of the toner becomes further nonuniform, the toner easily aggregates, sometimes worsening the line reproducibility and dot reproducibility.  Further, a decrease in the charging capability sometimes ciecreases the image oensity in tne latter naif cf duration.<br>
Further, in high-speed development systems, since a toner undergoes a large shear in a developing machine, the toner easily generates the tcr.er deterioration due to the embedding and the like of external additives in the developing machine,<br>
Under such an environment, since the function as a spacer of a fine silica powder decreases, the toner strongly undergoes influences of the nonuniforming of charging and the decrease in charging capability, more easily aggregating.<br>
For reducing such a toner deterioration, although an optimum amount of a fine silica powder<br><br>
having a larger particle diameter must be added, addition of the fine silica powder of the larger particle diameter having a fine structure on its surface is unpreferable because an influence of the nonuniforming of charging emerges.<br>
That is, only the addition of a fine silica powder simply as a spacer as conventionally is not sufficient in high-speed development systems, and the control of the surface properties by controlling the surface fine structure and the optimization of the particle diameter become important as in the present invention.<br>
Then, as a result of extensive studies on pore states of the surface of a fine silica powder, ^ne present inventors have found that the addition of a fine silica powder having a specific pore state to toner particles can stably provide an excellent density stability, line reproducibility and dot reproducibility even in copying machines, printers and the like which form high resolution latent images, over a long period regardless of environments.<br>
Specifically, the present invention is characterized by using a fine silica powder having a total pore volume, measured in the range of the pore diameter from not less than 1,7 nm to not more than 300.0   nra, of not more than 0.200   cm^/g.     The total pore volume is preferably not more than 0.070 cm^/g,<br><br>
more preferably not more than 0.025 cm"'/g.<br>
That the total pore volume measured in the range of the pore diameter from not less than 1.7 nm to not more than 300.0 nm is not more than 0.200 cra^/g represents that the number of pores in the surface of the fine silica powder is small and/or that the volume of every pore is small.  By making the surface structure have no pores and uniform in such a way, since the chargeability of the fine silica powder becomes uniform and the fine silica powder is largely improved in moisture resistance, the chargeability can stably be maintained over a long period regardless of environments.  Therefore, since the :;n.irgeabiiity of a toner becomes uniform and staDie, the toner can faithfully reproduce high resolution latent images without aggregation of the toner even in high-speed copying machines, printers and the like. Consequently, the toner can stably provide an excellent density stability, line reproducibility and dot reproducibility over a long period regardless of environments.<br>
That the total pore volume is larger than 0.200 cm'^/q   represents that many pores are present in the surface of a fine silica powder and/or that the volume of every pore is large.  In the case of such a fine silica powder, since the surface fine structure is nonuniform, the chargeability becomes nonuniform;<br><br>
and further, since water molecules in the air intrude pores, the charging capability decreases during duration.  As a result, since the chargeability of the toner becomes nonuniform in high-speed development systems, the cohesiveness worsens and the line reproducibility and dot reproducibility easily deteriorate.  Further, since the charging capability decreases, the image density easily decreases and the fogging easily worsens in the latter half of duration,<br>
In the present invention, the total pore volume is measured in the range of the pore diameter from not less than 1.7 nm to not more than 300.0 nm where the surface pore state of a fine silica powder can be .-.â  = 11 reproducibly measured and the pore state can accurately be measured in a long range.<br>
The present inventors have also found that use of a fine silica powder having a total pore volume, measured in the range of the pore diame^Ler from not less than 1.7 nm to not more than 300.0 nm, of not more than 0.200 cm^/q   allows addition of the fine silica powder having a larger particle diameter to toner particles.  Specifically, the fine silica powder of the present invention is characterized by having a volume median diameter (D50) of not less than 0.70 ^m and not more than 3.00 fim (preferably not less than 0.70 fim and not more than 1.50 ]im] .     By controlling the particle diameter of the fine silica powder in<br>
IM<br><br>
the above range, the toner does not generate the toner deterioration due to embedding and the like of the fine silica powder even in an environment where the toner undergoes a large shear in developing machines like higher-speed development systems, and can stably provide images having an excellent density stability, line reproducibility and dot reproducibility over a long period regardless of environments.<br>
The fine silica powder having a median diameter [D50) of less than 0.70 |j.m is easily embedded in the toner particles, and worsens the toner cohesiveness in high-speed development systems and easily decreases the line reproducioility and aot reproducibility.  By contrast, the fine silica powder<br>
having a median diameter (D50) of more than 3.00 ^im is easily liberated from the toner particles, and decreases the image density in rhe la-'er half of duration.<br>
In the present invention, to control the volume median diameter (D50) of a fine silica powder in not<br>
less than 0.70 \im  and not more than 3.00 p.m and control the total pore volume, measured in the range of the pore diameter from not less than 1.7 nm to not more than 300.0 nm, in not more than 0.200 cm^/g, the synthetic concentration and temperature and the cooling rate are achievably controlled in a<br><br>
preparation method of a fine silica powder.  As long as the particle diameter and pores of a fine silica powder are controlled in the above range, the particle shape is not especially limited.<br>
The pore volume in the present invention is measured by the gas adsorption method in which nitrogen gas is adsorbed on a sample surface, using a Porosimetry Analyzer Tristar 3000 [Shimadzu Corp.). The outline of the measurement is described in an operating manual issued by Shimadzu Corp., which is as follows.  Before the measurement of the pore distribution, 1 to 2 g of a sample is charged in a<br>
sample tube and vacuumed at 100Â°C for 24 h.  After the c omp 1 e t i on of the v a c'u urn i n g , "c h e s amp le is precisely weighed to obtain a sample.  The total pore volume in the range of the pore diameter from not less than 1.7 nm to not more than 300.0 nm of the obtained sample is determined by the BJH desorption merhod using the Porosimetry Analyzer.  The pore distribution is preferably evaluated based on the total pore volume nearest to the relevant measurement data information.<br>
The particle diameter distribution measurement in the present invention is made using a laser diffraction/scattering type particle diameter distribution analyzer LA-920 (HORIBA Ltd.).  The measuring method involves adding, for example, approximately 30 mg of a sample to 100 ml of an ion<br><br>
exchange water to become a dispersion medium, and subjecting the dispersed liquid to a treatment by an ultrasound disperser for 1 minute to make a dispersed liquid.  The dispersed liquid is dropwise charged in a measuring cell such that the sample concentration has a transmissivity of approximately 80%.  The relative refractive indexes of the measurement sample and water are set depending on the sample type and the particle diameter distribution based on volume is measured using the above-mentioned analyzer to determine a median diameter {D50).<br>
The present invention is characterized in that by using a fine silica powder described above whose :;re distribution and particle diameter are controlled, the toner does not aggregate and easily loosen in development even in an environment where the toner undergoes a large shear in developing machines like high-speed development 3y3terr;S, that is, in the state of the toner being consolidated.<br>
The evaluation of the cohesiveness of a toner in the consolidation state uses a ShearScan TS-12 (Sci-Tec Co.).  The ShearScan measures on a principle by the Mohr-Coulomb model described in 'CHARACTERIZING POWDER FLOWABILITY (published in 24 Jan 2002) written by Prof. Virendra M. Purl.<br>
Specifically, the measurement is conducted in room temperature environment (2 3Â°C, 60%RH) using a<br><br>
linear shearing cell (cylindrical, 80 mm in diameter, 140 cm"^ in volume] which can impart a shearing force linearly in the sectional direction.  A toner is charged in this cell, and loaded with a vertical load so as to become 2.5 kPa to fabricate a consolidated powder layer so as to take a closest packing state at this vertical load (the measurement by ShearScan is preferable in the present invention in   that   this consolidation state can be fabricated with no personal difference while the pressure is automatically detected).  Similarly, consolidated powder layers with the vertical load being 5.0 kPa and 10.0 kPa are formed.  A test is conducted in which the sample formed at the each vertical load is gradually loaded with a shearing force while continuously loaded with the vertical load applied when the consolidated powder layer have been formed, and variations of shear stress at this time are measured to determine a stationary point.  The consolidated powder layer is determined to have reached a stationary point when the variations in the shear stress and the displacement in the vertical direction of a loading unit to apply a vertical load become small and both the variations and the displacement come to take steady values in the test. Then, the vertical load is gradually deloaded from the consolidated powder layer which has reached a<br><br>
stationary point; a failure envelope at each load (a plot of vertical load stress vs. shear stress) is fabricated; and a Y-intercept and a slant are determined.  In the analysis by the Mohr-Couloinb model, the unconfined yield stress and the maximum consolidation stress are represented by the following expressions; and the Y-intercept denotes a 'cohesive force' and the slant denotes an 'internal friction angle'.<br>
Unconfined yield stress = 2c (l+sinij))/cos(tt Maximum consolidation stress =<br>
( (A-(A^sin^(})-Tssp^cos^(tt) Â°-^) /cos^(|))x (l + sin^.) - ( c/t antj)) (A = tT^<ip c="a" cohesive force an internal friction angle is ctssp><tan and a vertical load at stationary point></tan>
Unconfined yield stresses and maximum consolidation stresses calculated at each vertical load are plotted (Flow Function Plot) and a straight line is drawn based on the plot.  The unconfined yield stresses at 0.1 kPa and 20.0 kPa in maximum consolidation stress are determined from this straight line.<br>
Use of the relation of the maximum consolidation stress (X) and the unconfined yield stress (U) allows discussion of the loosenability of a powder layer consolidated at any load, that is,    powder characteristics (cohesive force between toner<br><br>
particles) of a closely packed toner layer.  The unconfined yield stress (U) relates to the loosenability by stirring in a toner container and to a situation when a toner passes through a control section and is coated on a toner carrier while undergoing a shear by a control member.  Further, the maximum consolidation stress (X) in the present invention denotes a stress loaded on a toner which is closely packed by a shear the toner undergoes in a developing machine.<br>
Accordingly, the unconfined yield stress at 0.1 kPa in maximum consolidation stress allows discussion of powder characteristics in a state of a relatively ^Tiall shear on a rcner; and the unconfined yield stress at 20.0 kPa in maximum consolidation stress allows discussion of powder characteristics in a state of a relatively large shear on the toner.  By the evaluation of transition of the unconfined yield stresses between the maximum consolidation stresses, powder characteristics of a toner layer under a consolidated state are expressed.<br>
The toner of the present invention preferably has an unconfiifed yield stress of not more than 1 kPa at a maximum consolidation stress of 0.1 kPa of the toner, and an unconfined yield stress of not less than 2.0 kPa and not more than 6.0 kPa at a maximum consolidation stress of 20.0 kPa of the toner.  By<br><br>
controlling a toner in the above range, the toner does not aggregate even in either state of a low-pressure consolidation and a high-pressure consolidation, and easily loosens in development, which is preferable.<br>
As long as a fine silica powder used in the present invention has the above characteristics, any one can be used, but one having characteristics described below is preferable.<br>
A fine silica powder in the present invention preferably has an average pore diameter of not more than 50.0 nm.  The case of the average pore diameter of more than 50.0 nm indicates that pores in the surface of the fine silica powder are large.  In the case of such a fine silica powder, the adsorbed moisture amount becomes large in a high-humidity environment and the charging capability easily decreases, which is unpreferable.<br>
The average pore diameter of a fine silica powder in the present invention is determined by a measuring method similar to that for the pore volume described before.<br>
Further, the toner according to the present invention preferably includes a hydrophobic fine inorganic powder having a BET specific surface area of not less than 50 m^/g and not more than 300 m^/g.<br>
By using together a hydrophobic fine inorganic<br><br>
powder which has a high fluidity-iinparting capability to the surface of a toner and a large BET specific surface area, a fine silica powder can be homogeneously dispersed in the toner.<br>
With the BET specific surface area of a hydrophobic fine inorganic powder of less than 50, the fine silica powder is not sufficiently dispersed, which is unpreferable.  With the BET specific surface area of a hydrophobic fine inorganic powder of more than 300, the toner charges up, unpreferably causing negative effects such as decrease in density.<br>
Hydrophobic fine inorganic powders include, for example, silicon dioxide (silica), titanium dioxide i.titania) , aluminum oxide â ..alumina; , zi.nc oxide, magnes ium oxide, cerium oxide, iron oxide, copper oxide and tin oxide.  Among these, especially a dry silica called a dry-method or fumed silica produced by vapor phase oxidation of a silicon halide is preferably used.<br>
Hydrophobization can be performed by using a treating agent, such as silicone vanishes, variously modified silicone vanishes, silicone oils, variously modified silicone oils, silane compounds, silane coupling agents, other organic silicon compounds and organic titanium compounds, singly or in a combination of two or more.<br>
The measuring method of the BET specific surface<br><br>
area involves, according ro the BET specific surface area method, using a specific surface area analyzer Gemini 2375 (Shimadzu Corp.), making nitrogen gas adsorbed on the surface of a   sample,   and   using the multipoint method of BET specific surface area to calculate a specific surface area.<br>
A fine silica powder in the present invention has, in its moisture adsorption-desorption at 30Â°C, an adsorbed moisture amount, in the adsorption process at a relative humidity of 80%RH, preferably of not less than 0.01 mass% and not more than 1.00 mass%, more preferably not less than 0.01 mass% and not more than 0.50 mass%, especially preferably not less than ,.10 mass^ and not nicre than 0.20 mass-"; .  I ne case where the adsorbed moisture amount at a relative humidity of 80%RH is larger than 1.00 mass% indicates that the amount of adsorbed moisture is much.  Since such a fine silica powder decreases the cJiargeability of a toner and worsens the cohesiveness, the developabiiity worsens (decrease in density, increase in fogging).  By contrast, the case where the adsorbed moisture amount is lower than 0.01 mass% indicates that the fine silica powder has an excessive hydrophobicity.  An excessively strong hydrophobicity collapses the charging balance such as charge-up, and is likely to decrease the density and worsen the fogging.<br><br>
The adsorbed moisture amount in the present invention is measured using an adsorption equilibrium measuring apparatus (Tokyo Testing Machine Inc., "EAM-02") .  This apparatus makes a solid-gas system reach a solid-gas equilibrium under the condition where an objective gas (in the present invention, water) only is present, and measures the solid weight and the vapor pressure at this time.<br>
The actual measurement of the moisture adsorption-desorption is entirely conducted automatically by a computer from measurement of" a dry weight and deaeration of dissolved air in water to measurement of a moisture adsorption-desorption, v;nich are shown oelow.  The outline of the in&amp;asuremen"c is described in an operation manual published by Tokyo Testing Machine Inc., and is as follows.  Here, in the present invention, water is used as a solvent liquid.<br>
First, approximately 5 g of a sample is charged in a sample container in an adsorption tube, and then, the temperature of a   const ant-temperature  bath and<br>
the temperature of the sample portion are set at 30Â°C. Thereafter, air valves VI (main valve) and V2 (exhaust valve) are opened; and a vacuum exhaust section is operated to vacuum a vacuum vessel interior to approximately 0.01 mmHg to dry the sample. A mass at the time when the mass of the sample comes<br><br>
not to change is defined as "dry mass".<br>
Since air is dissolved in water as a solvent liquid, deaeration must be performed.  First, water is charged in a liquid reservoir; the vacuum exhaust section is operated; the air valve V2 and an air valve V3 [liquid reservoir valve) are alternately opened to remove the dissolved air.  The above operation is several times repeated, and the time when air bubbles come not to be found is the finish of the aeration.<br>
Following the measurement   of   the dry mass and the aeration of dissolved air in water, the air valves VI, V2 are closed with the vacuum vessel i]"iterior k,ept urider vacuun"i and Lhe air valve V3 is opened to introduce water vapor from the liquid reservoir, and the air valve is closed.  Then, the air valve VI is opened to introduce the solvent vapor into the vacuum vessel and the pressure is measured by a pressure sensor.  If the pressure in the vacuum vessel does not reach a set pressure, the pressure in the vacuum vessel is made the set pressure by repeating the above operation.  When equilibrium is reached, the pressure in the vacuum vessel and the weight become constant, and the pressure and temperature and the sample weight at this time are measured as an equilibrium data.<br>
By the operations as described above, an<br><br>
adsorption-desorption can be measured by shifting the pressure of the water vapor.  In an   actual   measurement, relative vapor pressures for measurement of adsorbing amounts are set in advance.  With the set pressures of, for example, 5%, 10%, 30%, 50% 70%, 80%, 90% and 95%, the "adsorption process" in the present invention refers to a process in which an isotherm is drawn by measuring adsorbed moisture amounts in order from 5% upward; and the "desorption process" refers to a process in which, following the adsorption process, adsorbed moistore amounts are measured while the relative vapor pressure is reduced from 95% in the reverse order to the adsorption process.<br>
In this apparatus, tne pressure is set as a relative vapor pressure (%RH) and the adsorption-desorption is represented by the adsorbed amount (%) and the relative vapor pressure (%RH).  The calculating expressions of the adsorbed amount and the relative vapor pressure are shown below.<br>
I  M = ( (Wk-Wc)/Wc)xl00 Pk = (Q/QO)xlOO<br>
{wherein, M denotes an adsorbed amount (%); Pk denotes a relative vapor pressure (%); Wk (mg) denotes a sample mass; Wc fmg) denotes a dry mass of<br>
)  a sample; QO (mmHg) denotes a saturated vapor<br>
pressure of water determined by the Antoine formula by using a temperature Tk (Â°C) at an adsorption-<br><br>
desorption equilibrium; and Q {mmHg) denotes a pressure measured as an equilibrium data.)<br>
A fine silica powder used in the present invention preferably has a specific surface area of not less than 1.0 m^/g and not more than 20.0 m^/g, more preferably not less than 2.0 ra^/g and not more than 10.0 mVg.<br>
With the specific surface area of more than 20.0 m^/g, the fine silica powder is embedded in toner particles.  That is, since the toner deterioration easily occurs, negative effects such as decrease in the image density in the latter half of duration are generated.  With the specific surface area of less man 1 . u m' / g, tne toner does nor acqui re a suf i icier.i fluidity, causing negative effects such as decrease in the density in the latter half of duration.<br>
The measuring method of the EET specific surface area involves, according 1:0 the BET specific surface area method, using a specific surface area analyzer Gemini 2375 (Shimadzu Corp.], making nitrogen gas adsorbed on the surface of a sample, and using the multipoint method of BET specific surface area to calculate a specific surface area.<br>
The fine silica powder, which is a feature of the present invention, having an average pore diameter in the range of not less than 5.0 nm and not more than 50.0 nm and a total pore volume, with the<br><br>
pore diameter of not less than 1.7 nm and not more than 300.0 nm, of not more than 0.2OO   cm^/g, is manufactured preferably by the gas phase method.<br>
The preparation methods of a fine silica powder are classified into two types: the gas phase method in which the fine silica powder is produced by reacting a silicon compound, such as metal silicon, a silicon halide or a silane compound, in a gas phase; and the wet method in which the fine silica powder is obtained by removing a solvent from a silica sol suspension obtained by subjecting a silane compound such as an alkoxysilane to hydrolysis and condensation reaction in a water/organic solvent mixture, drying and granuiating the solvenn-remcved suspension.<br>
The present inventors have found that by optimizing the reaction condition of the gas phase method, the surface pore state of the fine silica powder can easily be controlled in the above range.<br>
Specifically, in the gas phase reaction, the temperature in the reaction system can be set above the melting point of the silica to form the fine silica powder having a small number of pores, since it is manufactured while molten.  Further, by controlling the cooling rate from the melting state, the pore state can easily be controlled.  Rapid cooling without control of the cooling rate easily<br><br>
causes pores, which is unpreferable.<br>
In the present invention, vapor-phase oxidation among vapor-phase methods is especially preferable whereby a fine silica powder is obtained by directly oxidizing a metal silicon powder raw material in a chemical flame composed of oxygen and hydrogen.  The vapor-phase oxidation can make the temperature inside the reaction system instantaneously above the melting point of the silica, and is a preferable method to control the surface pore structure and the particle diameter.<br>
On the other hand, in the wet method, since a fine silica powder is produced from a silica sol S'jsp'ension obtained by hydrolysis ana condensat:ior. reaction of a silane compound, the fine silica powder has a structure having an infinite number of pores in its surface.  Further, since the wet method has a lower reaction rate than the vapor-phase merhod and has a difficulty in controlling the pore distribution, the wet method is not a preferable preparation method of a fine silica powder with controlled porosity, which is a feature of the present invention,<br>
The content of the fine silica powder used in the present invention is preferably not less than 0.05 parts by mass and not more than 2.00 parts by mass based on 100 parts by mass of toner particles. With the content of a fine silica powder of more than<br><br>
2.00 parts by mass, a balance in chargeability of a toner collapses, easily causing problems such as   the density decrease and fogging.  If the content of the fine silica powder is less than 0.05 parts by mass, the toner has an insufficient amount of the power, which does not provide an effect of raising the chargeability by the addition of the fine silica powder.<br>
In the present invention, toner particles preferably have a weight-average particle diameter (D4) of not less than 4.0 jim and not more than 9.0 yim. Control of the particle diameter of the toner particles in the above range allows a more faithful reproduction of electrostatic latent images navmg a higher resolution, which is preferable in view of adaptation to a security image quality.  Further, in a system where a fine silica powder having a volume median diameter (D50) of not less than 0.70 um and not more than 3.00 (ira is loaded, the fine silica powder most effectively functions as a spacer, and hardly aggregates even in a consolidated state. When toner particles has a weight-average particle diameter (D4) of less than 4.0 um, since a balance in particle diameter between the toner and a fine silica powder collapses, the toner is not provided with a sufficient fluidity, causing negative effects such as decrease in the density in the latter<br><br>
half of duration.  When toner particles has a weight-average particle diameter (D4) of more than 9.0 jjm, reproducibility to electrostatic latent images having a higher resolution remarkably decreases, which is not preferable in view of adaptability to a security image quality.<br>
The toner of the present invention preferably has an acid value of not less than 5.0 mgKOH/g and not more than 50.0 mgKOH/g, more preferably not less than 10.0 mgKOH/g and  not   more   than 40.0  mgKOH/g.<br>
By controlling the acid value of the toner in this range, the affinity between a carboxyl group on the toner particle surface and a fine silica powder improves, allowing the secure presence ci tne fine silica powder on the toner particle surface.  As a result, the liberation rate of the fine silica powder from the toner particles is allowed to be controlled in an optimum range, providing a stable chargeability and improving the durable developability.<br>
When the toner has an acid value of less than 5.0 mgKOH/g, the affinity between the toner particle surface and the fine silica powder decreases, easily causing the isolation of the fine silica powder from the toner particle surface.  As a result, the fine silica powder cannot provide the effect as a spacer. When the toner has an acid value exceeding 50.0 mgKOH/g, a balance in chargeability of the toner<br><br>
pamicles collapses, providing a tendency of decreasing the image density and increasing the fogging.  Further, increase in the adsorbed moisture amount damages the environmental stability.<br>
The toner particles of the present invention preferably have a negative chargeability.  Addition of a fine silica powder, which has a highly negatively charging capability, to negatively chargeable toner particles makes the charging of the toner surface uniform, resulting in providing an effect of relaxing the electrostatic cohesion between the toners generated by the charging nonuniformity.  As a result, since aggregated lumps of the toner easily loosen when an eieciric fie^d is applied, latent images can faithfully be reproduced without overflowing the latent images even in the latent images having a high resolution formed by diameter-reduced laser spots, which is preferable in view of adaptability to a security image quality.<br>

If a binder resin including a polyester resin having a carboxyl group on   its   terminal is used, a fine silica powder having a controlled surface fine structure, which is a feature of the present invention, has a higher and rapidly-rising chargeability and provides the image density stable over a long period, so it is preferably used.<br>

In the hybrid resin, the mass ratio of a<br><br>
polyester monomer and a vinyl monomer is preierably 50/50 to 90/10, further preferably 60/40 to 85/15.

In such a system, the molecular weight distribution of a toner can be relatively easily designed and the toner can be made to have a wide fixing region, which is<br><br>
preferable.<br>
The colorant of the present invention is preferably a magnetic iron oxide.  Since use of a magnetic iron oxide of a dielectric as  a   colorant allows easy loosening of aggregated lumps of a toner on   application of an   electric field, even latent images having a high resolution formed by diameter-reduced laser spots can faithfully be reproduced without overflowing the latent images, which is preferable in view of adaptability to the security image quality.  The magnetic iron oxide is preferably used also in view of the durable stability in highÂ¬speed machines.<br>

required, to make the toner releasable.  As the wax, hydrocarbon waxes such as low molecular-weight polyethylenes, low molecular-weight polypropylenes, microcrystalline waxes and paraffin waxes are preferably used because of their easy dispersibility in a toner and high releasability, but one or more other waxes can be together used in a small amount as necessary.

hexamethylenebisstearic acid amide; unsaturated fatty acid amides such as ethylenebisoleic acid amide, hexamethylenebisoleic acid amide, N,N' -dioleyladipic acid amide and N,N'-dioleylsebacic acid amide; aromatic bisamides such as m-xylenebisstearic acid amide and N,N'-distearylisophthalic acid amide; fatty acid metal salts (commonly called metal soaps) such as calcium stearate, calcium laurate, zinc stearate and magnesium stearate; waxes obtained by grafting vinyl monomers such as styrene and acrylic acid to aliphatic hydrocarbon waxes; and partially esterified compounds of fatty acids and polyhydric alcohols, such as behenic acid monoglyceride, and methyl ester compounds having a hydroxyl group obtainea by hydrogenating vegetable oils.<br>
Releasing agents especially preferably used in the present invention include aliphatic hydrocarbon waxes.  Such aliphatic hydrocarbon waxes include, for example, low molecular-weight alkylene polymers obtained by radical polymerization of an alkylene under high pressure or by polymerization under low pressure using the Ziegler catalyst; alkylene polymers obtained by pyrolyzing a high molecular-weight alkylene polymer; synthetic hydrocarbon waxes obtained from distillation residues of hydrocarbons obtained from a synthetic gas containing carbon monoxide and hydrogen by the Arge method, and<br><br>
synthetic hydrocarbon waxes obtained by nydrogenating the foregoing synthetic hydrocarbon waxes; and compounds obtained by fractionating these aliphatic hydrocarbon waxes by utilizing press perspiration, the solvent method, vacuum distillation or fractional crystallization.<br>
Hydrocarbons as a base of the above-mentioned aliphatic hydrocarbon waxes include, for example, hydrocarbon compounds {for example, ones synthesized by the synthol method and hydrocoal method (using a fluidized catalyst bed)) synthesized by the reaction of carbon monoxide and hydrogen using a metal oxide catalyst (in many cases, binary or multi-component caialyst); hydrocarbons having up no several hundrea carbon atoms obtained by the Arge method (using a fixed catalyst bed), which can provide much waxy hydrocarbon; and hydrocarbons obtained by polymerization of alkylenes such as ethylene by the Ziegler catalyst.  In the present invention, among these hydrocarbons, those having fewer and smaller branches and longer saturated straight chains are preferable, and those synthesized otherwise than polymerization of alkylenes are especially preferable in view of the molecular weight distribution.<br>

Fzefarably  not   less   than   1   part by mass   and  not mere than 20 parrs by mass of Lhe releasing ageni is added to 100 parts by mass of a binder resin.  The addition of less than 1 part by mass cannot provide a desired sufficient releasing effect; and the addition exceeding 20 parts by mass causes poor dispersion in a toner, adhesion of a toner to a photosensitive member, and surface contamination of developing members and cleaning members, easily causing problems such as deterioration of toner images.<br>

The physical properties of the toner of the present invention are measured as follows.  Examples described later are also based on the methods. (1) Measurement of the particle diameter of a toner<br>
Although the particle diameter distribution can be measured by various methods, in the present invention, it is measured using a Multisizer of Coulter Counter.<br>
A Multisizer HE type of Coulter Counter (Beckman Coulter, Inc.) is used as a measuring apparatus, and is connected to an interface (Nikkaki-bios Co., Ltd.) and an analytical computer to output<br><br>
the number distribution and the volume distribution; and a 1% NaCl aqueous solution is prepared using the special or first grade sodium chloride as an electrolytic solution.  The measuring method involves adding 0.1 to 5 ml of a surfactant (preferably alkylbenzenesulfonate) as a dispersant to 100 to 150 ml of the electrolytic aqueous solution, and further adding 2 to 20 mg of a measurement sample thereto. The electrolytic solution in which the sample is suspended is dispersed for approximately 1 to 3 min by an ultrasound disperser and the toner particle diameter is measured by the Coulter Counter<br>
Multisizer II using an aperture of 100 ^m.  The volume ana tne number ci   cte "Ccner are measured co calC'^lane the volume distribution and the number distribution. Then, the weight-average particle diameter (D4) based on weight is determined from the volume distribution. (2) Measurement of the acid value<br>
In the present invention, the acid value can be measured by the following method.<br>
The basic operation is according to JIS K-0070.<br>
1)	0.5 to 2.0 (g) of a toner is precisely weighed and the weight of the toner is denoted as W (g).<br>
2)	The sample is charged in a 300-ml beaker, and added and dissolved with 150 (ml) of a mixed solution of toluene/ethanol (4/1).<br>
3)	The resultant solution is titrated using a<br><br>
solution of 0.1 N KOH in methanol and using a potentiometrie titrator (for example, the automatic titration using a potentiometric titrator made by Kyoto Electronics Mfg. Co., Ltd., AT-400 {win workstation), and an ABP-410 electric burette can be utilized.).<br>
4)	The consumed amount of the KOH solution in the titration is denoted as S (ml) and the consumed amount of the KOH solution simultaneously measured as a blank is denoted as B (ml).<br>
5)	The acid value is calculated by the following expression where f is a factor of the KOH.<br>
Acid value (mgKOH/g) = { ( S-B) xf &gt;
The softening point of a binder resin is measured by a Koka type flow tester according to JIS K 7210.  The specific procedure is described below.<br>
By using a Koka type flow tester {Shimadzu Corp.), a sample of 1 cm"^, while it is being heated up at a temperature-rising rate of 6Â°C/min, is loaded with a load of 1,960 N/m^ {20 kg/cm^) by the plunger so as to be extruded out through a nozzle of 1 mm in diameter and 1 mm in length.  Thereby, a curve of the plunger descending amount (flow value) vs. the temperature is drawn; when the height of the S-shaped curve is denoted as h, the temperature at h/2<br><br>
(temperature where a half of the resin h^s   flowed out &gt; is denoted as a softening temperature.<br>
(4)	Measurement of the glass transition temperature<br>
of a binder resin<br>
A measuring apparatus: a differential scanning<br>
calorimeter (DSC), MDSC-2920 (manufactured by TA<br>
Instruments)<br>
The measurement is conducted according to ASTM D3418-<br>
82.<br>
2 to 10 mg, preferably 3 mg of a measurement sample is precisely weighed.  The weighed sample is charged in an aluminum pan; and the measurement is conducted at a temperature-rising rate of 10Â°C/min in "he measuremeni: remperarure range from 30 -c 20uÂ°C in ordinary humidity with use of an empty pan as a reference.  The analysis is conducted by using a DSC curve in the range of temperatures from 3 0 to 2 0 0Â°C obtained from a temperature-rising process at zhs second time.<br>
(5)	Measurement of the molecular weight distribution<br>
by gel permeation chromatography (GPC)<br>
A column is stabilized in a heat chamber at 40Â°C; THF as a solvent is made to flow through the column at this temperature at a flow rate of 1 ml/min and approximately 100 ^il of a THF sample solution is injected thereto for the measurement.  For the molecular weight measurement of a sample, the<br><br>
molecular weight distribution a sample has is calculated from a relation between the logarithmic value and the count value of a calibration curve fabricated using several kinds of monodispersion polystyrene standard samples.  As the standard polystyrene samples for the fabrication of a calibration curve, for example, standard polystyrene samples whose molecular weights are approximately 10^ to 10^ made by Tosoh Corp. or Showa Denko K.K. are used and use of at least about ten kinds of standard polystyrene samples is appropriate.  A detector is an RI (refraction index) detector.  A combination of some commercially available polystyrene gel columns are :: 1 ei erably used incluair.g , for exam.ple , Shodex GrC KF-801, 802, 803, SO'^, 805, 806, 807 and 800P made by Showa Denko K.K., and a combination of TSkgel GIOOOH(H^L) . G2000H(H^L&gt; , G3000H(HÂ«L) , G4000H (H,;^) , G5000H {H&gt;,L) , G6000H(H&gt;:L] , G7000H(H:,L} and TSkgurd column made by Tosoh Corp.<br>
Samples are prepared as follows.<br>
A sample is added in THF, allowed to stand at 25Â°C for several hours, fully shaken to be fully mixed with THF (until no lumps of the sample are present), and further allowed to stand for at least 12 h.  At this time, the standing time in THF is made to be 24 h.  Thereafter, the THF solution is passed through a sample treatment filter {pore diameter: 0.2 to 0.5 \im,<br><br>
for example. My Shori-Disk H-25-2 (Tosoh Corp.) is<br>
usable.) to malce the solution a sample for GPC.  The<br>
concentration of the sample is adjusted to become 0.5<br>
to 5 mg/ml in terms of resin component.<br>

â 	Magnetic iron oxide particles      60 parts by mass (average particle diameter: 0.15 ^m;   coercive force (He) at 796 kfl/m: 11.5 kA/m; saturation magnetization (cjs) : 90 Am^/kg; and residual magnetization (ffr) : 16<br>
AmVkg)<br>
â 	A wax b (Fischer-Tropsch wax; melting      "^ parts by point: 105Â°C)	^^^^<br>
â 	A  charge controlling agent c	2 parts by<br>
mass<br>
The above materials were premixed by a Henschel<br><br>
mixer, and then melced and kneaded by a twin-screw extruder.  At this time, the staying time was controlled such that the temperature of the kneaded resin became 150Â°C.<br>
The obtained kneaded material was cooled, coarsely crushed by a hammer mill, and pulverized by a turbo mill; and the obtained finely pulevrized powder was classified using a multi-division classifier utilizing the Coanda effect to obtain toner particles having a weight average particle diameter of 5.8 ^m.  1.0 part by mass of a hydrophobic inorganic fine powder "a" (silica; BET: 140 m^/g; and hydrophobized with 30 parts by mass of<br>
hexamerhyldisilazane (HMDS) and 10 parts by mass oi a dimethylsilicone oil), 0.2 parts by mass of the fine silica powder B~l and 3.0 parts by mass of strontium titanate were externally added and mixed into 100 parts by mass of the toner particles, and sieved through a mesh of 150 jim in aperture to obtain a toner 1.<br>
Toner internal addition formulations are shown in Table 4 and physical properties are shown in Table 5.<br>
For evaluating the toner 1 under conditions of higher speed and higher resolution, a remodeled machine of a commercially available copying machine (IR-6570, Canon Corp.) which was remodeled into 2,400<br><br>
dpi and 1.5-fold printing-speed was used.  500,000 sheets were continuously printed using a test chart of 5% in printing proportion under each environment<br>
of a high-temperature high-humidity environment {30Â°C,<br>
80%RH), an ordinary-temperature ordinary-humidity<br>
environment {23Â°C,    50%RH) and an ordinary-temperature<br>
low-humidity environment (23Â°C, 5%RH) to evaluate the<br>
following.<br>
(Image density, fogging)<br>
The image density was measured as the reflection density of 5 mm-circle images by a Macbeth densitometer (Macbeth Co.) using an SPI filter.  To determine fogging, a reflection densitometer .' rei iectometer, model : TC- 6D3, 1 ckyo DenshcKU Co , , Ltd.); was used, and the fogging level was given by Ds-Dr to evaluate fogging where Ds denotes the worst reflection density for white background after image formation and Dr denotes the average reflection density for the transfer material before image formation.  Therefore, the smaller value of the fogging amount indicates the better fogging suppression.  This evaluation was conducted at the initial printing time and 500,000-sheets printing tiine in the each test environment.  The evaluation results are shown in Tables 6, 7 and 8. (Line width reproducibility)<br>
The reproducibility of the line width was<br><br>
evaluated at the initial printing time and after the 500,000-sheets continuous printing in the each test environment using the above-mentioned image forming testing machine by the following method.  Latent images (horizontal lines) of 168 urn in line width were obtained using a laser of 2,400 dpi.  The line widths after image formation of the latent images were magnified at xl50 magnification by an optical microscope and the images were measured using an image analyzing soft (Image Pro) to determine the change rate to the line widths of the latent images using the expression below from the average value of three lines; and the reproducibility of the line ".viath was evaluated on zr.e   following snanaard.  The results are shown in Tables 6, ~l   and 8. (Expression 1&gt; line width change rate {%)   =<br>
([line width of latent image -line width of formed image!) / (line width of latent image ) ^  100 A: change rate of not more than 5% B: change rate exceeding 5% and not more than 10% C: change rate of exceeding 10% and not more than 20% D: change rate exceeding 20% (Evaluation of tailing)<br>
The tailing was evaluated at the initial printing time and after the 500,000-sheets printing formation in the each test environment by forming<br><br>
three horizontal line images at intervals of 1 cm under the condition of making the line width on<br>
sheets at 168 |im using the above-mentioned image<br>
forming test machine.  The images were magnified at<br>
xl50 magnification by an optical microscope and the<br>
line widths of the magnified images were measured at<br>
intervals of 3 ^im to determine the standard<br>
deviations of the line widths.  The average standard<br>
deviation of three lines was determined from the<br>
standard deviation of each line.  The level of tailing<br>
was evaluated on the following standard.  The results<br>
are shown in Tables 6, 7 and 8.<br>
A: standard deviation of not more than 5<br>
5: stanaara aeviation exceeding 5 and not more than<br>
15<br>
C: standard deviation exceeding 15 and not more than<br>
25<br>
D: standard deviation exceeding 25<br>
(Evaluation of the dot reproducibility)<br>
The dot reproducibility was evaluated at the initial printing time and after the 500,000-sheets printing formation in the each test environment by forming images of an isolated one-dot pattern of 2,400 dpi using the above-mentioned image forming test machine.  The images were observed by an optical microscope to examine the dot reproducibility, which was evaluated on the following standard.  The results<br><br>
are shown in Tables 6, 7 and 8.<br>
A: No spread of toner out of latent images was<br>
observed and dots were completely reproduced.<br>
B: Slight spread of toner out of latent images was<br>
observed.<br>
C: spread of toner out of latent images was observed.<br>
D: Notable spread of toner out of latent images was<br>
observed.<br>
