				<td>This invention relates to a device useful for cutting stable noie or manhole on the walls of underground mines required for mining and safety purpose.<br>
In underground coal mines or even in non-coal mines, it is required to make man holes on the walls of a traveling road for miners. The height of such man holes are maintained generally as the common height of a man and about 1 m inside the rock of the mining wall. This type of holes are made as the emergency shelter for the mine workers traveling in the roads of underground mines es. The man holes provide temporary shelter and protection against many unseen dangers which may occur any time in the mines.<br>
These manholes are generally made by the picking method i.e. by the help of labourer's picks. It is necessary to make hundreds of man holes to fulfill the requirement in a mine and at the same time the process is time taking and tedious job for the workers. Thus the safety process in the mines gets delayed.<br>
Further, in the process of extraction of coal or minerals, sometimes it becomes necessary to cut stable holes on the wall of .mineral deposit or in the pillars. Sometimes, for making ditch on the side walls which is necessary for isolation stopping, generally pickminers are employed. Again, the process becomes very slow by the manual labourers and the purpose of safety of isolation stopping is not really fulfilled.<br>
Till date there no such machine which can quickly cut a man hole or a stable hole or a ditch on the side walls of mineral deposits in underground mines.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a suitable machine which can quickly cut man hole or stable hole or ditches on the side walls in underground mines and easily operable, maintainable, repairable and economically viable for the common Indian mines.<br>
In figure 1 of the drawings accompanying this specification the schematic diagram of the equipment of the present invention is illustrated.<br>
In figure 1 the various parts are (1) cutter head (2) power transmission, (3) motor, (4) hydraulic advancing ram (5) wheeled rack and pinion system, (6) movable vertical frame, (7) multi telescopic hydraulic jack, (8) powerpack, (9) freely movinc bottom support, (10) wheels, (11) transwitch, (12) chassis, (13]<br>
â€¢*<br>
steering, (14) motor and (15) mechanical brakes.<br>
Accordingly, tne present invention provides a device useful for making manhole or stable hole in the underground mines, which comprises a cutter head (1) coupled with a motor<br>
(3), the said head (1) being connected with an advancing hydraulic ram (4), characterised<br>
i<br>
in that the said advancing ram (4) being mounted upon a vertical frame (6) ,the said frame (6) is provided with a rack and pinion (5) , the said rack and pinion (5) is coupled with the said cutter motor (3) through the transmission (2), the said vertical frame (6) for cutter boom being supported by a multi telescopic hydraulic jack (7) and a freely moving bottom support (9), the said hydraulic jack (7) and bottom support (9) being hinged upon a chassis (12), four wheels (10), an electric motor (14), a power pack (8), and electrical trans-switch (11) being installed upon the said chassis (12), the said motor (14) has power transmission for the said power pack (8) and also for the movement of wheels (10), the said chassis also provided with one steering (13) which is connected with front wheels and two mechanical br^ak^(15) at bothisides.<br>
This new invention a device which can be utilized for cutting man hole or any stable hole on the sides of walls of ore body. The general side of the machine is very slim, it can be comfortably accommodated is a mining gallery/roadway/tunnels. At the time of operation, the machine is anchored by mechanical brakes on both sides. Then the multi-telescopic ram (7) is operated through the valve box of power pack (8). Then the advancing ram (4) is operated to move the cutter head (1) towards the wall of coal seam, such that the ram would push the cutter head on the coal face all the time. Then the cutter motor (3) is operated fro cutting the face upto the required depth. The advancing ram (4) can be lowered by the rack and pinion arrangement (5) whenever -required over the range of vertical frame (6). After the cutting operation, the frame can be made horizontal over the chassis by operating the ram (7), the;device can be moved by the motor power (14) through steered wheels.<br>
Advantages of the present invention :<br>
1)	This machine can cut quick holes of 1m depth and upto  3m<br>
height on the side walls.<br>
2)	It is easily operable.<br>
3)	As it is not heavier, transporting is easier.<br>
4)	As power consumption is less, running cost is less.<br>
5)	It is easy to maintain and maintenance cost is least.<br>
6)	It  is cheap and economically viable for  common  Indian<br>
mines.<br>
7)	This machine can be used for multiple purposes whenever a<br><br>
vertical  ditch  cutting will be necessary on the the underground mines.<br>
walls  in<br><br><br><br><br><br>
We Claim:<br>
1). A device useful for making manhole or stable hole in the underground mines, which comprises a cutter head (1) coupled with a motor (3), the said head (1) being connected with an advancing hydraulic ram (4), characterised in that the said advancing ram (4) being mounted upon a vertical frame (6) ,the said frame (6) is provided with a rack and<br>
pinion (5), the said rack and pinion (5) is coupled with the said cutter motor (3) through<br>
1	the transmission (2), the said vertical frame (6) for cutter boom being supported by a multi telescopic hydraulic jack (7) and a freely moving bottom support (9), the said hydraulic jack (7) and bottom support (9) being hinged upon a chassis (12), four wheels (10) , an electric motor (14), a power pack (8), and electrical trans-switch (11) being installed upon the said chassis (12), the said motor (14) has power transmission for the said power pack (8) and also for the movement of wheels (10), the said chassis also provided with one steering (13) which is connected with front wheels and two mechanical br*akss(15) at both sides.<br>
2) A device useful for making manhole or stable hole on the walls of underground mines, required for mining and safety purpose substantially as herein described with reference to fig. 1 of the drawings accompanying the complete specification.<br></td>
