Hydrocyanation of an olefinically unsaturated compound<br>
The present invention relates to a process for hydrocyanating an olefinically unsaturated nitrile in the presence of an Ni(0)-containing catalyst, which comprises carrying out the reaction in the presence of a hydrocarbon which leads under certain pressure, concentration and temperature conditions to the formation of at least two liquid phases of the overall system, of which one phase has a higher proportion of the Ni(0)-containing catalyst, based on the total weight of this phase, than the other phase or other phases.<br>
Processes for hydrocyanating an olefinically unsaturated nitrile in the presence of an Ni(0)-containing catalyst are known.<br>
For instance, US 3,773,809 describes the hydrocyanation of 3-pentenenitrile or 4-pentenenitrile in the presence of a catalyst system composed of Ni(0) and one of these complexing ligand systems comprising firstly monophosphines or monophosphites and secondly a nitrile, and also further compounds as catalyst promotors.<br>
The resulting product mixture is admixed with a hydrocarbon in an extractor under defined conditions to form a multiphasic system. One phase of this multiphasic system comprises the hydrocarbon and the predominant portion of the organophosphorus compounds and the Ni(0) complexes mentioned, while organic mononitrile, organic dinitrile, decomposed Ni catalyst, decomposed organophosphorus compound and catalyst promoter are substantially present in another phase.<br>
The hydrocarbon phase is removed.<br>
Organic mononitrile, organic dinitrile and catalyst promoter are removed from the decomposed nickel catalyst and the decomposed organophosphorus compound in the other phase.<br>
With regard to the retention or utilization of the hydrocarbon phase, US 3,773,809 merely contains the information in example 3 that the hydrocarbon was removed to obtain a concentrate.<br>
A disadvantage of such a distillative removal of the hydrocarbon is that the content of extractable product in the extractant is only low. According to example 3, only 4.61 g of<br><br>
extractable product are present in 4638 g of cyclohexane. The removal mentioned is therefore associated with high energy and technical demands.<br>
In addition, this distillative removal has the problem that on the one hand, to prevent thermal decomposition of the catalytically active compounds present in the hydrocarbon phase, a very low distillation temperature is desirable, as attained, for example, by reducing the pressure; on the other hand, it is desirable in industrial distillations to use river water for countercooling, i.e. for condensing the distillate. This in turn sets limits on the reduction of the distillation pressure.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a process which enables the removal of the Ni(0)-containing catalysts used in the hydrocyanation of an olefinically unsaturated nitrile from the product and unconverted reactant, preferably with the possibility of reusing the catalyst mentioned, in particular in the hydrocyanation mentioned, in a technically simple and economic manner.<br>
We have found that this object is achieved by the process defined at the outset.<br>
According to the invention, an olefinically unsaturated nitrile is hydrocyanated in the presence of an Ni(0)-containing catalyst.<br>
The preparation of Ni(0)-containing catalyst systems is known per se and, for the purposes of the present invention, can be effected by processes known per se.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the Ni(0)-containing catalyst may additionally contain a compound which is suitable as a ligand for Ni(0) and contains at least one trivalent phosphorus atom, or a mixture of such compounds.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the compound used as a ligand may be one of the formula<br><br>
In the context of the present invention, this compound is a single compound or a mixture of different compounds of the aforementioned formula.<br>
X1, X2, X3 may each independently be oxygen or a single bond.<br><br>
When all of the X1, X2 and X3 groups are single bonds, compound (I) is a phosphine of the formula P(R1 R2 R3) with the definitions of R\ R2 and R3 specified in this description.<br>
When two of the X1, X2 and X3 groups are single bonds and one is oxygen, compound (I) is a phosphinite of the formula P(OR1)(R2)(R3) or P(R1)(OR2)(R3) or P(R1)(R2)(OR3) with the definitions of R\ R2 and R3 specified in this description.<br>
When one of the X1, X2 and X3 groups is a single bond and two are oxygen, compound (I) is a phosphonite of the formula P(OR1)(OR2)(R3) or P(R1)(OR2)(OR3) or P(OR1)(R2)(OR3) with the definitions of R\ R2 and R3 specified in this description.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, all X1, X2 and X3 groups should be oxygen, so that compound (I) is advantageously a phosphite of the formula P(OR1)(OR2)(OR3) with the definitions of R\ R2 and R3 specified in this description.<br>

The R1, R2 and R3 groups may be bonded together directly, i.e. not solely via the central phosphorus atom. Preference is given to the R1, R2 and R3 groups not being bonded together directly.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, R1, R2 and R3 are radicals selected from the group consisting of phenyl, o-tolyl, m-tolyl and p-tolyl.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment, a maximum of two of the R1, R2 and R3 groups should be phenyl groups.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, a maximum of two of the R1, R2 and R3 groups should be o-tolyl groups.<br><br><br><br><br><br>

The R21 and R22 radicals may each independently be the same or different organic radicals. Advantageous R21 and R22 radicals are aryl radicals, preferably those having from 6 to 10 carbon atoms, which may be unsubstituted or mono- or polysubstituted. in particular by C1-C4-alkyl, halogen, such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine, halogenated alkyl, such as trifluoromethyl, aryl, such as phenyl, or unsubstituted aryl groups.<br>
The R11 and R12 radicals may each be separate or bridged.<br>
The R21 and R22 radicals may each be separate or bridged.<br>
The R11, R12, R21 and R22 radicals may each be separate, two may be bridged and two<br>
separate, or all four may be bridged, in the manner described.<br>

C7H150S02" or S042*. Further suitable promoters disclosed by US 3,773,809 are borohydrides, organoborohydrides and boric esters of the formula R3B and B(OR)3, where R is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, aryl radicals having from 6 to 18 carbon atoms, aryl radicals substituted by alkyl groups having from 1 to 7 carbon atoms and aryl radicals substituted by cyano-substituted alkyl groups having from 1 to 7 carbon atoms, advantageously triphenylboron. Moreover, as described in US 4,874,884, it is possible to use synergistically active combinations of Lewis acids, in order to increase the activity of the catalyst system. Suitable promoters may, for example, be selected from the group consisting of CdCI2, FeCI2, ZnCI2, B(C6H5)3 and (C6H5)3SnX, where X=CF3S03, CH3C6H4S03 or (C6H5)3BCN, and the preferred ratio specified of promoter to nickel is from about 1:16 to about 50:1.<br>
In the context of the present invention, the term Lewis acid also includes the promoters specified in US 3,496,217, US 3,496.218, US 4.774,353. US 4.874.884. US 6,127,567, US 6,171,996 and US 6,380,421.<br>
Particularly preferred Lewis acids among those mentioned are in particular metal salts, more preferably metal halides, such as fluorides, chlorides, bromides, iodides, in particular chlorides, of which particular preference is given to zinc chloride, iron(ll) chloride and iron(lll) chloride.<br>
According to the invention, the reaction is carried out in the presence of a hydrocarbon which leads under certain pressure, concentration and temperature conditions to the formation of at least two liquid phases of the overall system, of which one phase has a higher proportion of the Ni(0)-containing catalyst, based on the total weight of this phase, than the other phase or other phases.<br>
In the context of the present invention, a hydrocarbon is a single hydrocarbon or a mixture of hydrocarbons.<br>
Hydrocarbon should advantageously have a boiling point of at least 30°C, preferably at least 60°C, in particular at least 90°C, at a pressure of 105 Pa.<br><br>
Hydrocarbon should advantageously have a boiling point of at most 140°C, preferably at most 135°C, in particular at most 130°C, at a pressure of 105 Pa.<br>
Suitable hydrocarbons are described, for example, in US 3,773,809, column 3, lines 50-62.<br>
Preference is given to a hydrocarbon selected from the group consisting of cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane, cycloheptane, n-hexane, n-heptane, n-octane, isooctane and mixtures thereof, in particular from methylcyclohexane, n-heptane, isomeric heptanes, n-octane, isomeric octanes such as 2,2,4-trimethylpentane and mixtures thereof, more preferably methylcyclohexane, n-heptane, 2,2,4-trimethylpentane, n-octane, octane isomer mixture and mixtures thereof.<br>
With particular preference, a hydrocarbon, in the context of this invention meaning a single hydrocarbon or else a mixture of such hydrocarbons, can be used for removal, in particular by extraction, of adiponitrile from a mixture comprising adiponitrile and an Ni(0)-containing catalyst, said hydrocarbon having a boiling point in the range between 90°C and 140°C. From the mixture obtained after the removal according to this process, the adiponitrile may advantageously be obtained by distillative removal of the hydrocarbon, and the use of a hydrocarbon having a boiling point within the range specified allows a particularly economical and technically simple removal by the possibility of condensing the distilled-off hydrocarbon with river water.<br>
The hydrocyanation can be carried out in a manner known per se, for example in accordance with the documents specified in this description.<br>
In general, such hydrocyanations can be carried out at a temperature in the range from -50°C to 200°C and a pressure in the range from 0.05 to 100 bar, while a temperature in the range from -15°C to 75°C and a pressure in the range from 0.05 to 10 bar have been found to be advantageous.<br>
It has been found that, surprisingly, when carrying out the process according to the invention, the presence of the hydrocarbon defined in accordance with the invention results in no impairment of the hydrocyanation compared to such a hydrocyanation in the absence of such a hydrocarbon, for example a reduction in the catalyst activity to be expected as a result of dilution.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, after the hydrocyanation,<br><br>
the overall system may be placed under pressure, concentration and temperature conditions which lead to the formation of at least two liquid phases, of which one phase has a higher proportion of the Ni(0)-containing catalyst, based on the total weight of this phase, than the other phase or other phases, and then<br>
said phase which has a higher proportion of the Ni(0)-containing catalyst, based on the total weight of this phase, than the other phase or other phases may be removed from the overall system.<br>
For phase separation, a wide pressure, concentration and temperature range can generally be selected, and the optimum parameters of the particular composition of the reaction mixture can be determined easily by a few simple preliminary experiments.<br>
An advantageous temperature has been found to be at least 0°C, preferably at least 20°C.<br>
An advantageous temperature has been found to be at most 100°C, preferably at most 60°C.<br>
An advantageous pressure has been found to be at least 0.1 bar, preferably at most 0.5 bar.<br>
An advantageous pressure has been found to be at most 10 bar, preferably at most 5 bar.<br>
Phase separation can be carried out in one or more apparatus known per se for such phase separation.<br>
In an advantageous embodiment, the phase separation can be carried out in the same reactor in which the hydrocyanation of the process according to the invention is likewise carried out, for example by equipping this reactor with a calming zone.<br>
The phase separation results in two liquid phases, of which one phase has a higher proportion of the Ni(0)-containing catalyst, based on the total weight of this phase, than the other phase or other phases.<br>
Advantageously, the phases are separated from one another, in particular said phase which has a higher proportion of the Ni(0)-containing catalyst, based on the total weight of this phase, than the other phase or other phases, is removed from the overall system.<br><br>
Said phase contains the predominant portion of Ni(0) and of the phosphorus compound suitable as a ligand for Ni(0). When the ligand used is a mixture of at least one monodentate ligand and of at least one bidentate ligand, there is generally accumulation of the bidentate ligand in said phase relative to the monodentate ligand compared to the one or more further phases. This is particularly advantageous since, in this advantageous embodiment, the bidentate ligands, which are typically more thermally sensitive than the monodentate ligands, are converted to an easily recyclable form, while the monodentate ligands, which can be thermally stressed, may optionally be removed from the one or more further phases by separating processes involving little thermal stress, such as extraction, or else by processes involving thermal stress, such as distillation.<br>
Organic mono- and dinitriles, Lewis acid and any catalyst decomposition products formed are substantially present in one or more of the one or more other phases.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, said phase containing the predominant portion of Ni(0) and of the phosphorus compound suitable as a ligand for Ni(0) is recycled into a hydrocyanation of an olefinically unsaturated compound of the process according to the invention.<br><br><br>
