				<td>The present invention relates to a novel pre-stressed rail sleeper particularly useful for underground haulage track. The present invention is applicable to wide range of load application exerted in underground haulage track rail sleeper. It provides more strength, which results into keeping a pair of rails in a particular distance used for haulage tracks for tub or mine car movement in a mine / tunnel.<br>
The present invention provides a novel sleeper for reinforcing a haulage track in a mine. This sleeper will be able to hold the track rails in a predetermined distance when used in mine/ tunnel haulage roads, which may be laid over the ballast as available inside the mine/tunnel. The novel sleeper of the present invention will be capable of holding the track as per design, into a previously made mine haulage road in underground or even in surface and thereby ensure a uniform track gauge distance.<br>
It is well known that various kinds of sleepers are used to keep the rails of a haulage track as per the predetermined design of track. These sleepers that may be wooden, concrete or reinforced concrete slabs that serves the basis for design and the support mechanism of any haulage or transportation tracks in the mine as well as in the surface which is laid over an evenly laid ballast to provide an uniform load distribution over the ground.<br>
Extensive efforts have been made to the development of various sleeper devices for tracks of surface as well as for underground mine. To highlight the wide mining and tunneling usage and continual efforts, which have been made by other inventors to improve the performance of sleepers, a few patent references are provided below for illustration.<br>
A lot of inventions have been made in this arena but those are clumsy and cost ineffective in the context of installation as well as operation. Some related inventions are discussed below along with their drawbacks at length.<br>
Reference may be made to US patent No. US 6,230,981 entitled as "Steel railroad sleepers". The excerpt of this invention is given below:<br>
Abstract: A steel railroad sleeper of inverted channel section whose open ends can selectively be closed by end plates detachably connected one to open end of the sleeper and whose sides incline downwardly and outwardly from the upper rail supporting surface of the sleeper, the sleeper being produced by cold forming strip steel. The sleeper may be produced by cold pressing or cold rolling and the end plates may also be produced by cold forming steel strip. In one embodiment the sleeper has a waisted section of reduced width. This waisted section may be positioned generally midway along the length of the sleeper. The central section of the sleeper interior may be filled with a material to prevent the ingress of ballast to this central region.<br>
The main disadvantages of this invention being: it is very heavy being made ofl concrete, difficult to manufacture, ends are elongated upwardly and difficult to maneuver.<br>
Reference may be made to U.S. patent no. 6,581,848 titled 'Sleeper frame for a rail system for rail-mounted vehicles, especially for a ballasted track'. The synopsis of this invention is given below:<br>
Abstract: The invention relates to a sleeper frame for a track system for railborne vehicles, particularly for a ballasted track, consisting of several cross-ties provided in the direction transverse to the track, and one or several longitudinal supports connected with the cross-ties, wherein one cross-tie, respectively, substantially forms the outer delimitation of the sleeper frame in the longitudinal direction, with outer bearings and fixtures for the rails being provided on the outer cross-ties, and with a continuous or quasi-continuous bearing for the rails being provided between the outer rail bearings.<br>
The main disadvantage of this system is that it is costly and complicated. It is to be used generally for permanent type railway track but in mine haulage system the tracks are temporary and only for transporting the muck generated in construction and some other mining materials. Thus this invention will make it heavier and difficulty in transportation and installation of these sleepers in underground mine.<br>
Reference may be made to EU patent no. WO2006069553 titled 'Concrete sleeper and method for the production thereof as shown in figure 1 of the drawings accompanying this specification. The synopsis of this invention is given below:<br>
Abstract: Disclosed is a concrete sleeper for great dynamic loads with rail supporting areas (2) and a lower base zone. Said concrete sleeper is made of a high-strength standard concrete (4) that absorbs great pressure. The rail supporting areas (2) and/or the lower base zone is/are made of a wear-resistant, non-abrasive, or tension-proof material.<br>
The main disadvantages of this invention are: it is heavy being made of concrete, heavier, difficult to manufacture, ends are elongated upwardly and difficult to maneuver.<br>
Reference may be made to U.S. patent no. 6,070,806 titled 'Sleeper'. The synopsis of this invention is given below:<br>
Abstract: The sleeper (tie) comprises a body which has a variable cross section along its length and is made from reinforced polymer concrete with a dispersed reinforcement in the form of steel or synthetic fibres or both the one and the other together, which fibres compose 5-7% of the total mass of the body of the sleeper, are of different length and have a different percent of content depending on the type of fibre. At the points of fastening the rails, inserts are provided in the body, the height of the inserts satisfying the relationship: 2/3 H.sub.1 .gtoreq.H.sub.2 1/3 H.sub.1, where H.sub.1 is the height<br>
of the highest portion at each end of the body of the sleeper, H.sub.2 is the height of the insert. The upper face of the middle part of the body is positioned higher than the lower face of the insert by a value .DELTA.H which is within the limits 0.5(H.sub.1 -H.sub.2).DELTA.H0.1(H,sub.1 -H.sub.2). Metallic and wooden inserts of various geometric shape are used.<br>
The main disadvantages of this invention is: it is of fibre material, metallic and wooden inserts makes it difficult to manufacture and permanent nature which does not suggest frequent replacement as required in mine haulage system. And it is also difficult to maneuver.<br>
Reference may be made to U.S. patent no. 6,595,434 titled 'Rail bounded transport system'. The gist of this invention is given below:<br>
Abstract: Track-bound transport systems have existed for a long time. The drawback with them is that they can only withstand low load and are vulnerable in varying weather conditions. The purpose of the invention is to considerably increase the load they are capable of supporting and to reduce dependence on changes in weather.<br>
Thus this invention is applicable to low load and vulnerable to weather makes it unsuitable to mine haulage system. Moreover highly skilled labour is required to install these sleepers.<br>
Reference may be made to U.S. patent no. 4,946,099 titled 'Sleeper construction'. The gist of this invention is given below:<br>
Abstract: A concrete sleeper has an elongate metal insert having a T-slot containing a T-head of a retaining block which bears against a rail foot to retain rail gauge. The retaining block can be rotated by 180.degree. and slid along the T-slot to abut an edge of the foot of a rail, the T-slot being sufficiently long to allow adjustment of the rail on the sleeper. After rail position has been determined, Hie block location can be fixed by inserting grout into the T-<br>
slot. Alternatively, the T-slot can have abutment lugs which determine the block position, and thereby the rail position.<br>
The main disadvantages of this invention is: it is heavy due to retaining block, difficult to manufacture, and also difficult to maneuver.<br>
Reference may be made to European patent no. RU2250279 entitled 'Reinforced concrete under rail base and method of its construction1.<br>
Abstract: FIELD: railway transport; permanent way. * SUBSTANCE: invention relates to permanent way designed to take up load from rolling stock. Frame base consists of reinforced concrete frame ties placed in row on crushed stone ballast layer. Each tie is made of reinforced rigidly interconnected two longitudinal (sleeper) parts and two cross-members forming rectangular frame with hollow middle part with trapezoidal section projections with under-rail pads in places of connection of longitudinal parts. Cross-members of frame tie are rigidly connected with longitudinal parts by inner faces of longitudinal parts at right angle, and outer face of longitudinal part of each frame tie has smooth surface. Shaped cutouts are made on cross-members of each frame two sides. Cutouts on inner side are used to form space in inner part of tie in form of cell, and those on outer side, to form cell between adjacent frame ties equal to inner cell. Rail fastenings of adjacent frame ties are arranged at constant pitch equal to distance between axes of frame cross-members. At approaches to bridges, tunnels and overhead roads, reinforced concrete frames are laid in cross-members of which over their entire length and flush with upper surface tubular rectangular section parts are imbedded to which "shuttle-like" joint ends of counter-rails or counter-angles are fastened by means of bolts with T-head through holes of corresponding shape made in place of fastening. Method of construction of under-rail base comes to the following: frame ties are placed on ballast layer with clearance between adjacent frames to provide free access to ballast layer for tamping mechanisms from outside and inside of longitudinal parts of reinforced concrete frames. Clearance is found from following equation: H=0.5B where H is value of clearance; B is width of cell between cross-members inside each frame. Rail fastenings of adjacent frame ties are installed at constant pitch equal to distance between axes of frame crass-members. EFFECT: reduced labor input and volume of work, improved stability of rail track, reduced expenses possibility of laying "shuttle-like" joined ends of counter-rails of counter-angles at approaches to bridges, tunnels.<br>
The main disadvantage of this system is that it is costly, uses lot of concrete thus making it heavier and difficulty in transportation of these sleepers in underground mine or a tunnel.<br>
Reference may be made to European patent no. DE102004008357 entitled 'Rail track for rail vehicles comprises several sleepers arranged in the longitudinal direction of the track and extending in the longitudinal direction of the sleeper across the longitudinal direction of the track' as shown in figure 2 of the drawings accompanying this specification. The gist of the invention is given below:<br>
Abstract; Rail track (10) comprises several sleepers (18) arranged in the longitudinal direction of the track and extending in the longitudinal direction of the sleeper across the longitudinal direction of the track. The sleepers are anchored on a support (20). The sleepers have two rail fixing regions (26, 28) arranged at a distance from each other in the longitudinal direction of the sleeper. - Preferred Features: The support is made from concrete, asphalt or similar material.<br>
The main disadvantage of this invention is that it is not cost effective for mine operators and may create uneven inter-track spacing.<br>
Reference may be made to US no. 4,802,623 entitled 'Concrete cross<br>
sleeper system'. The gist of the invention is given below: Abstract: Modern D.C.-tractioned trains and track circuit signal systems as well as high load trains need a special track construction. A new concrete cross sleeper system is provided for high load and high velocity tracks as well as for urban rapid transit systems comprising rails and sleepers having center part, connected to bar shaped ends and having reinforcing means. On the bar shaped ends two rail seats for each rail are positioned having elastic, electrically non-conducting plastic pads. The rails are fastened onto the rail seat by special tension means clamping the foot of the rail and fixed into plugs in the sleepers. This feature allows a triple point fixing of the rail at each sleeper end. Tracks on asphalt pavement may be secured by anchor device of the general type<br>
as sold under the trademark NELSON. The new track construction decreases the intermittent load of the rail/sleeper system and avoids trouble in track circuit signal systems existing in normally used prestressed concrete sleepers.<br>
The main disadvantage of this system is that it is costly, uses a lot of concrete thus making it heavier and difficulty in transportation of these sleepers in underground mine or a tunnel.<br>
Reference may be made to European patent no. GB1165168 entitled 'Improvement in railway track sleepers' as shown in figure 3 of the drawings accompanying this specification.<br>

The non-obvious inventive steps of the novel pre-stressed rail sleeper particularly useful for underground haulage track, resides in the combination of the following:<br>
(a)	It contains a pair of steel tie rods of circular section with suitable<br>
diameter welded under pre-stressed condition with a pair of C-shaped<br>
flats of rectangular section to form a D-shaped loop which sustains<br>
bending stress during dynamic loading.<br>
(b)	It has plurality of individual U-shaped steel wires (web) for holding the<br>
concrete grout within the frame.<br>
(c)	In the middle of the frame, a rectangular shaped steel rod is welded to<br>
provide stability in position and to provide hand hold facility for<br>
carrying purpose.<br>
(d)	It has a folded wire net of suitable size which is inserted inside the<br>
webs for reinforcing the concrete structure to make it strong and<br>
stable.<br>
(e)	It has suitable rectangular shaped concrete slabs structure at both<br>
ends for better absorption of shock loads on rails.<br>
(f)	Rectangular shaped small concrete slabs at the ends in stead of full<br>
concretization of frame makes the sleeper lighter and economical.<br>
The following example is given by way of illustration of the working of the invention in actual practice and therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
Example-1<br>
A pre-stressed rail sleeper for supporting a haulage track in a mine was manufactured as detailed in the embodiment of the present invention in figures 8 to 11 of the drawings. A D-shaped loop (2,3) of 82 cm long was formed by welding a steel tie rod (2) of circular section having 10 mm thickness &amp; length 52 cm in pre-stressed condition with a C-shaped flat (3) of rectangular section having 2cm width &amp; 1cm thickness (pre-stressing is done by pressing the C-shaped flat inwardly through an external force suitably at the time of welding with the tie rod). A frame was fabricated by welding with a rectangular shaped 10mm steel rod (5) and a pair of rectangular steel flats (7) having size 75mmx15mmx12mm at each end. Distance between nearer rectangular steel flats (7) is 56mm while 76 mm for farther. Each rectangular steel flats (7) has threaded hole within at the top ends. Both the bottom end of the D-shaped loop are welded with the plurality of individual U-shaped steel wires (web) (8),. A folded suitable wire net (9) of suitable size is inserted inside the webs (8) made by U-shaped wires at the bottom portion of (3). Both the end of the assembly (2, 3, 5, 7, 8 &amp; 9) is concretized in a suitable rectangular shaped slab which contains the portion of 2 &amp; 3, and full of 7, 8 &amp; 9 inside the slab. The dimension of concrete slab is 21mmx10.5mmx12mm. Two pairs of nuts (6) and cleats (4) each having a hole within is fixed upon both the concrete slabs (1) by means of threaded hole with the steel flats (7).<br>
The manufactured rail sleeper was subjected to compression test of slab. It was found that the concrete could withstand the pressure of 450 kg/sq cm. It was also thrown several times from a height of 2m to check the effect of impact load. It was found to be alright even after 10 times of free fall.<br>
The main advantages of the present invention for pre-stressed rail sleeper particularly useful for underground haulage track are:<br>
1.	It has nominal chemical reaction with the ballast materials which provides<br>
security for prolong utility of the sleeper.<br>
2.	Scarcity of wooden sleepers due to uncontrolled deforestation, it meets<br>
the requirements eco-friendly.<br>
3.	It can be reused due to prolong life expediency.<br>
4.	It can be easily, cheaply and reliably manufactured as well as installed<br>
using the same prevailing techniques due to simple design.<br>
5.	It equips uniform inter-track distance/alignment of the rails which provides<br>
smooth motion of mine cars/tubs on the track.<br>
6.	It provides better contact / bonding strength between the rails and the<br>
sleepers.<br>
7.	It checks the chances of stealing in comparison to wooden sleeper which<br>
is prevalently used as fire wood.<br>
<br>
8.	It is easy to transport inside/out side the mine.<br>
9.	It provides less maintenance cost of track.<br>
<br>
