				<td>Multi-layered air permeation preventing layer of pneumatic tires<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a multi layered air permeation preventing layer of<br>
pneumatic tires. More specifically, the present invention relates to a multi-layer air<br>
permeation preventing layer of pneumatic tires which includes inner liner layer obtained<br>
by the polymer composition including a thermoplastic resin and an elastomer, and a<br>
carcass rubber layer coated on the inside and outside of the inner liner layer.<br>
Background Art<br>
The most important problem the automobile industry is faced with is the reduction<br>
of fuel consumption rate. This increasingly requires the reduction of the weight of tires.<br>
Currently, the inside of tires has an inner liner or an air permeation preventing<br>
layer that is made of a halogenated butyl rubber or another rubber having low air<br>
permeation.<br>
However, the halogenated butyl rubber employed as an inner liner or an air<br>
permeation preventing layer has a high hysteresis loss, causing a ripple on the inner rubber<br>
of a carcass layer and the air permeation preventing layer after a vulcanization of the tire<br>
and thereby deforming both the carcass layer and the air permeation preventing layer. This<br>
leads to an increased rolling resistance.<br>
As a solution of this problem, a rubber sheet called "tie rubber" having a low<br>
hysteresis loss is inserted between the air permeation preventing layer (halogenated butyl<br>
rubber) and the carcass layer. The insertion of the rubber sheet increases the total thickness<br>
of the tire layer above 1 mm (l,000um) in addition to the thickness of the air permeation<br>
preventing layer made of a halogenated butyl rubber. This results in the increased weight<br>
of the complete tire.<br>
In an attempt to solve this problem, there have been suggested techniques of<br>
employing different materials for the air permeation preventing layer of pneumatic tires<br>
instead of such a conventional rubber material as halogenated butyl rubber having low air<br>
permeation.<br>
For example, Japanese Patent Laid Open No. 6-40207 proposes a technique of<br>
providing an air permeation preventing layer in the inside of the tire by laminating a low<br>
air permeation layer including a polyvinylidene chloride film or an ethylene-vinyl alcohol<br>
copolymer film and an adhesive layer including a polyolefin film, an aliphatic polyamide<br>
film, or a polyurethane film to form a thin film, affixing the thin film to the inner side of<br>
the green tire consisting of non-vulcanized rubber to make the adhesive layer in contact<br>
with the carcass layer, and then vulcanizing and shaping the green tire.<br>
The use of a thin air permeation preventing layer makes it possible to reduce the<br>
weight of the tire without deteriorating the maintenance of pneumatics.<br>
However, the thermoplastic multi-layer film, if used for an inner liner or another<br>
air permeation preventing layer, has a low elongation with respect to repeated<br>
deformations while in use, causing a lot of cracks on it and hence a deterioration of air<br>
tightness.<br>
hi the conventional tire manufacturing method that requires a step of shaping an<br>
inner liner, the thermoplastic film commercially available encounters oriented<br>
crystallization caused by drawing and heat crystallization by thermosetting after drawing<br>
and annealing processes, providing poor elongation against deformation in the shaping<br>
process with a consequence of fracture. In conclusion, the conventional manufacturing<br>
methods make it impossible to realize the fabrication of tires from thermoplastic films<br>
commercially available.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
In an attempt to derive an alternative method for employing a thermoplastic resin<br>
as an inner liner, the inventors of the present invention have found out that rnulti layered<br>
air permeation preventing layer for pneumatic tires having an inner liner layer of the nondrawn<br>
film formed from a polymer composition including a mixture of an elastomer and a<br>
thermoplastic resin excellent in air permeation preventive property, and the carcass layer<br>
on the inner and outer sides of the inner liner layer can be used as an air permeation<br>
preventive layer to guarantee high elongation, against deformation during the shaping<br>
process, a good air permeation preventive property and the thermoplastic film act like a<br>
carcass rubber owing to high thickness difference between carcass rubber and<br>
thermoplastic film.<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a multi layered air<br>
permeation preventing layer for pneumatic tires which can be easily formed the tire owing<br>
to having excellent durability against- deformation during the vulcanization, and has good<br>
air tightness property, and does not affect other tire properties thanks to thermoplastic<br>
resin acts like a rubbery state.<br>
To achieve the above object of the present invention, there is provide a multi<br>
layered air permeation preventing layer of pneumatic tires comprising the inner liner layer<br>
of a non-drawn film formed from polymer composition including 60 to 90 wt.% of a<br>
thermoplastic resin and 10 to 40 wt.% of an elastomer, and the carcass rubber layer coated<br>
on the inside and outside of the inner liner layer, wherein the multi layered air permeation<br>
preventing layer of pneumatic tires has a -50 to -lOt^ of steep decreasing range of the<br>
elastic modulus.<br>
The present invention will be described in further detail as follows.<br>
The multi layered air permeation preventing layer for pneumatic tires according to<br>
the present invention comprise a non-drawn film formed from polymer composition<br>
including a mixture of a thermoplastic resin and an elastomer as a inner liner layer, and a<br>
carcass rubber layer coated on the inside and outside of the inner liner layer.<br>
The tire manufacturing process necessarily includes a shaping process, during<br>
which the film is formed to have the shape of a tire with an air blower at the room<br>
temperature. Accordingly, the inner liner must not have any fracture caused by the<br>
deformation in the shaping process. However, most of the films commercially available<br>
are not durable against defonnation from oriented crystallization, heat crystallization and<br>
oriented crystallization after the drawing and annealing processes.<br>
For that reason, the present invention applies deformation during the shaping<br>
process in the tire manufacturing process as a conception of film drawing at the room<br>
temperature.<br>
Instead of forming a drawn film from a polymer composition including a<br>
thermoplastic resin and an elastomer, a non-drawn film is used to produce an inner liner<br>
•without drawing or annealing so as to secure ductility against deformation in the shaping<br>
process.<br>
The specific polymer composition for the non-drawn film of the present invention<br>
is as follows. The specific examples of the thermoplastic resin as used herein may include<br>
polyamide resins, e.g., nylon 6, nylon 66, nylon 46, nylon 11, nylon 12, nylon 610, nylon<br>
612, nylon 6/66 copolymer, nylon 6/66/610 copolymer, nylon MXD, nylon 6T, nylon 6/6T<br>
copolymer, nylon 66/PP copolymer, or nylon 66/PPS copolymer, N-alkoxyalkylated<br>
polyamide resins, e.g., methoxymethylated nylon 6, methoxymethylated nylon 6/610, or<br>
methoxymethylated nylon 612; polyester resins, e.g., polybutyleneterephthalate,<br>
polyethyleneterephthalate, polyettryleaeisophthalate, PET/PEI copolymer, polyacrylate,<br>
polybutylenenaphthalate, liquid crystal polyester, polyoxyalkylenediimido 2-<br>
oxygen/polybutylate terephthalate copolymer, or other aromatic polyesters; polynitrile<br>
resins, e.g., polyacrylonitrile(PAN), polymethacrylonitrile, acrylonitrile/styrene copolymer<br>
(AS), methacrylonitrile/styrene copolymer, or methacrylonitrile/styrene/butadiene<br>
copolymer; polymethacrylate resins, e.g., polymethylmethacrylate(PMMA), or<br>
polyethylmethacrylate; polyvinyl resins, e.g., vinyl acetate, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), vinyl<br>
alcohol/ethyl ene copolymer (EVOH). polyvinylidenechloride(PVDC),<br>
polyvinylch]oride(PVC), polyvinylchloride/polyvinylidenechloride copolymer,<br>
polyvinylidene chloride/methylacrylate copolymer. or polyvmylidenechloride/acrylonitrile<br>
copolymer; cellulose resins, e.g., cellulose acetate, or cellulose acetobutyrate; fluoride<br>
resins, e.g., polyvinylidenefluoride(PVDF), polyvinyl fluoride, polychlorofluoroethylene<br>
(PCTFE), or tetrafluoroethylene/ethylene copolymer; or amide resins, e.g., aromatic<br>
polyimide (PI), etc.<br>
The elastomer compatible with these thermoplastic resins may include, if not<br>
specifically limited to, diene rubbers and their hydrogenated products, e.g., natural rubber,<br>
isoprene rubber, epoxidated natural rubber, styrene-butadiene rubber, butadiene rubber<br>
(high cis-butadiene rubber, or low cis-butadiene rubber), natural rubber-butadiene rubber,<br>
hydrogenated natural rubber-butadiene rubber, or hydrogenated styrene-butadiene rubber,<br>
olefin rubbers, e.g., ethylene-propylene rubber (EPDM), maleic acid-modified ethylenepropylene<br>
rubber, IIR, isobutylene and aromatic vinyl or diene monomer copolymer, acryl<br>
rubber, or ionomer; haiogenated rubbers, e.g., Br-IIR, Cl-ItR, brominated isobutylene<br>
paramethylstyrene copolymer (Br-EPMS), CR, chlorohydrine rubber (CHR),<br>
chlorosulfonated polyethylene (GSM), chlorinated polyethylene (CM), or maleic acidmodified<br>
chlorinated polyethylene (M-CM); silicon rubbers, e.g., methylvinylsilicon<br>
rubber, dimethylsilicon rubber, or methylphenylvinylsilicon rubber, sulfur-containing<br>
rubbers, e.g., polysulfide rubber, fluoride rubbers e.g., vmynaene rmonae ruooer,<br>
fluorine-containing vinylether rubber, tetrafluoroethylenepropylene rubber, fluorinecontaining<br>
silicon rubber, or fluorine-containing phosphazene rubber; or thermoplastic<br>
elastomers, e.g., styrene elastomer, olefin elastomer, ester elastomer, urethane elastomer,<br>
polyamide elastomer, etc.<br>
The composition of the thermoplastic resin and the elastomer can be determined<br>
according to the balance of film thickness, internal air permeation, and flexibility.<br>
Preferably, the polymer composition includes 60 to 90 wt.% of the thermoplastic resin and<br>
10 to 40 wt.% of the elastomer. When the content of the elastomer exceeds 40 wt.%, the<br>
film of the polymer composition is not suitable for a tire inner liner because of its poor gas<br>
barrier property inadequate to the air insulation of the tire. With the content of the<br>
elastomer less than 10 wt.%, the film cannot realize the rubber-like elastomer features to<br>
give the difficulty in the manufacture of tires and make the tires vulnerable to fracture<br>
while running.<br>
It is preferable that a suitable compatibility enhance is used as a third component<br>
when the thermoplastic resin is incompatible with the elastomer. The addition of such a<br>
compatibility enhancer deteriorates the interfacial tension between the thermoplastic resin<br>
and the elastomer to reduce the size of the rubber particles forming the dispersed phase,<br>
thereby helping the features of the two components realize more effectively. The<br>
compatible enhancer may include a copolymer having at least either one structure of the<br>
thermoplastic resin or the elastomer, or a copolymer structure having an epoxy group, a<br>
carbonyl group, a halogen group, an amine group, an oxazoline group, or a hydroxyl<br>
group that is reactive to the thermoplastic resin or the elastomer. The compatible enhancer<br>
is preferably selected depending on the types of the thermoplastic resin and the elastomer,<br>
and generally includes styrene/ethylene-butylene block copolymer (SEBS) and its maleic<br>
acid-modified product, EPDM, EPDM/styrene or EPDM/acrylonitrile graft copolymer and<br>
its maleic acid-modified product, styrene/malate copolymer, reactive phenoxine, etc. The<br>
content of the compatibility enhancer is, if not specifically limited to, 0.5 to 10 parts by<br>
weight with respect to 100 parts by weight of the thermoplastic resin and the elastomer.<br>
In addition to the mentioned essential polymer components, a compatibility<br>
enhancer polymer or another polymer can be optionally used as long as it does not<br>
deteriorate the necessary properties of the polymer composition for tires. The use purpose<br>
of another polymer is improving the compatibility of the thermoplastic resin and the<br>
elastomer, enhancing the film forming ability of the materials and the heat resistance, and<br>
reducing the manufacture cost. The specific examples of such a material may include<br>
polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, ABS, SBS. SEES, polycarbonate, etc. The<br>
material may also include another olefin copolymers, their maleic acid-modified, or their<br>
derivative containing a glycidyl group. The polymer composition of the present invention<br>
may further include additives that can be mixed with a polymer formula, such as filler,<br>
carbon, powdered quartz, calcium carbonate, alumina, titan dioxide, etc.<br>
The polymer composition thus obtained is subjected to melt-extrusion and<br>
quenching to produce a non-drawn sheet, which is applied as an inner liner.<br>
The inner liner of the present invention thus obtained, which has an oxygen<br>
permeability of less than 15 X 10"3 ccm/m2-24hr-atm, and a fracture elongation of more<br>
than 200 % at the room temperature, causes no fracture even by severe deformation during<br>
the tire shaping process, facilitating the tire manufacture, and provides good air tightness<br>
and oxygen leakage preventive ability.<br>
Preferably, the non-drawn sheet has the maximum value of the complete elastic<br>
deformation interval, that is, a yield point of more than 10 % at -35 °C.<br>
The inner liner of the tire thus manufactured is also deformed under different<br>
deformation conditions, which cause a deterioration of the performance or me inner nner.<br>
Especially, the deformation caused under severe conditions due to temperature variations<br>
during the use of the tire further deteriorates the performance of the inner liner.<br>
Accordingly, the inner liner of the present invention as a non-drawn sheet has a<br>
yield point of more than 10 % at -35 °C, so it can maintain the performance of the inner<br>
liner in spite of a tire deformation under normal weather conditions and a deformation<br>
under severe cold conditions of-35 °C.<br>
In applying such a thermoplastic film to tires, a behavior like a rubbery state should<br>
be realized. For this purpose, the carcass rubber layer may be adhered to the outside and<br>
inside of the inner liner so as that thin thickness thermoplastic resin film can act<br>
identically like thick carcass rubber compared with it.<br>
When the behavior like the rubbery state is applied to the thermoplastic resin film,<br>
it happens a problem that an oxygen permeability which is main property of the inner liner<br>
is increased. Accordingly, it is very difficult that both the behavior like the rubber and the<br>
oxygen permeability are satisfied at the same time because of their opposed properties.<br>
However, if thickness difference between the inner liner on the film and the carcass rubber,<br>
and the adhesive strength are large, the thermoplastic resin film can act identically like the<br>
tire rubber without acting independently.<br>
In using these properties, the reduction of the weight of tires may be satisfied at the<br>
same time, and if the adhesive strength of film and tire are permitted at its maximum, a<br>
behavior of film can max be reduced owing to the inner line film having the thickness<br>
against the reduction of air tightness with thick thickness of carcass rubber, it is preferable<br>
that a suitable thickness of carcass rubber layer is 0.5 to 5mm.<br>
Also, carcass rubber layers may be afSxed to both sides of the inner liner so as to<br>
compensate for scratch resistance.<br>
The adhesive as used herein may include anything if used when manufacturing a<br>
commercial tire and is not specially limited.<br>
For this purpose, an adhesive layer must be provided on both sides of the inner<br>
liner by adhesive coating. In addition, a peeling paper is used so as to prevent adhesion<br>
between the both-sided adhesive layers for easier packaging in the roll form. The peeling<br>
paper as used herein may include a polyethyleneterephtalate, polypropylene, polyethylene<br>
films and so on. The vulcanization process of inner liner is performed according to a<br>
general tire manufacturing method after such an adhesion.<br>
It is desirable that the multi-layered air permeation preventing layer manufactured<br>
by the non-drawn film adhered to the carcass rubber layer on the both side of the inner<br>
liner layer has a steep decreasing range in elastic modulus of—50 to -10 "C.<br>
The "steep decreasing range in elastic modulus" of the present invention means a<br>
steep decreasing range in elastic modulus value according to a temperature change as<br>
shown in a graph of FIG. 2.<br>
Preferably, the multi-layered air permeation preventing layer satisfy the following<br>
equation 1 at the described temperature range, that is, from -50 °C to -10"C<br>
Equation 1<br>
E'VE'2 = 100 "1,000,<br>
wherein, the E'1 is the elastic modulus value at -50'C and E'2 is the elastic modulus<br>
value at-10TD.<br>
Further, at the temperature range of 0 to 200 "C, it is desirable that elastic modulus<br>
values satisfy the following equation 2.<br>
Equation 2<br>
B'3/E'4 = less than 10,<br>
wherein, the E'3 is the elastic modulus value at 0"C and E'4 is the elastic modulus<br>
value at 200 °C.<br>
Also, the absolute value of the elastic modulus of the present invention is<br>
preferably less than 1010 dyne/cm! at -35 °C.<br>

The condition for affixing and vulcanizing the carcass rubber layer is the same with<br>
vulcanization condition when manufacturing tires. The practical tires include the carcass<br>
rubber thickness of about 1 mm adhered to the most inside layer of the tire when affixing<br>
both sides. On the opposite side, however, a viscoelastic behavior will be very rubbery<br>
because the carcass rubber as a main body of tire has a thickness of more than 1mm. In<br>
using the estimating method, the final matter properties thereafter will be estimated.<br>

As can be seen from Table 1, when the content of the polyamide elastomer<br>
amounts to exceed 40 wt.%, the films had such an oxygen permeability to exhibit a poor<br>
gas barrier property inadequate to the air insulation of the tire. Therefore, the films were<br>
difficult to use as a tire inner liner.<br>
Further, the adhesion of die carcass rubber layer has no effect on a gas barrier<br>
property whether the layer is one side or both sides.<br>
As the result to tensile fracture elongation at the room temperature and the low<br>
temperature, the matter property change is observed according to the content of the<br>
elastomer as the following table 2 which are shown only comparative examples not<br>
affixing the carcass rubber layer.<br>

As can be seen from Table 2, all the samples had a room-temperature elongation<br>
of more than 300 % high enough to stand a deformation of about 200% at the room<br>
temperature during the shaping process.<br>
La the low-temperature measurements, the sample of the Comparative Example 1<br>
" had a yield point of 73%, which means that the tire manufactured cannot guarantee a<br>
complete elasticity recovery under a deformation of more than 7.3% at a low temperature<br>
of -35°C while running and possibly has a permanent deformation to cause a serious<br>
problem in maintaining the air tightness. In addition, other samples excepting<br>
Comparative Example 1 had a yield point of more than 10%, implementing that the tire<br>
manufactured realizes a complete elasticity recovery under a deformation of less than 10%<br>
even at a low temperature of -35°C while running, without affecting other properties such<br>
as durability. However, in the case of the comparative examples without carcass rubber<br>
layer can not have a steep decreasing range of a elastic modulus, as shown hi the viscoelastic<br>
behavior following Figures.<br>
The result of viscoelastic behavior is shown in FIGS 1 and 2.<br>
Fig. 1 is a measurement result of viscoealstic behavior to comparative examples 1<br>
to 5. Referring to Fig. 1, the deterioration of elastic modulus increase according to an<br>
increase of the content of the elastomer. However, it will be known that the absolute value<br>
is large without getting out of a limitation of the thermoplastic resin.<br>
Fig. 2 is an example in case of the carcass rubber being adhered and also shows the<br>
viscoelastic behavier of only the carcass rubber layer of vulcanized 1mm thickness for<br>
reference.<br>
Referring Fig. 2, the elastic modulus differences between the comparative example<br>
3 of the thermoplastic resin and the carcass rubber are to differ from their absolute value<br>
and shape. However, example 2 and comparative example 7 show very rubbery behavior.<br>
Particulary, when the carcass rubber adhesive side is both sides of the thermoplastic resin<br>
film(Exmaple 2), it brings a synergy effect of rubbery behavior more than adhered to one<br>
side(Comparative example 7).<br>
As shown from the result of Fig. 2, the multi-layered air permeation preventing<br>
layer of pneumatic tires according to the present invention includes the steep decreasing<br>
range of the elastic modulus at -50 ~ -10 "C, and it satisfy the following equation.<br>
Equation 1<br>
E'VE'2= 100 "1,000<br>
Wherein, the E'1 is the elastic modulus value at -50 "C and E'2 is the elastic<br>
modulus value at -10 °C.<br>
Further, within temperature scope of 0 ~ 2001), the elastic modulus values at 0*C<br>
and 200 X? satisfy the following equation.<br>
Equation 2<br>
E'3/E'4 = less than 10<br>
Wherein, the E'3is the elastic modulus value at 0"C and E'4 is the elastic modulus<br>
value at 200 °C.<br>
Further, the absolute value of the elastic modulus is less than 10 dyne/cnf at -35 °C.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
As described above in detail, when a non-drawn sheet obtained from a polymer<br>
composition including a thermoplastic resin and an elastomer is applied to an inner liner<br>
and a carcass rubber layer adheres to both the sides according to the present invention, the<br>
tire has no fracture under a severe deformation during the tire shaping process owing to a<br>
fracture elongation of more than 200%, and thus being easy to manufacture the tire and<br>
preventing bad impact to tire property by acting a rubbery behavior in spite of the<br>
thermoplastic resin film without a reduction of air tightness. Accordingly, the present<br>
invention is useful as an air permeation preventive layer of pneumatic tires.<br>
While this invention has been described in connection with the embodiments, it is<br>
to be understood to those skilled in the art that the invention is not limited to the disclosed<br>
embodiments, but, on the contrary, is intended to cover various modifications and<br>
equivalent arrangements. Particularly, the number of layers is flexible and the core/shell<br>
structure can have a gradient Accordingly, the technical coverage of the present invention<br>
is to be included within the spirit and scope of the appended claims.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
