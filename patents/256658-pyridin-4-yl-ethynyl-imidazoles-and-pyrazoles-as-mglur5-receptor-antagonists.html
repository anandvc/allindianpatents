It has now surprisingly been found that the compounds of general formula I are metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonists. Compounds of formula I are distinguished by having valuable therapeutic properties. They can be used in the treatment or prevention of mGluR5 receptor mediated disorders.'<br>
In the central nervous system (CNS) the transmission of stimuli takes place by the interaction of a neurotransmitter, which is sent out by a neuron, with a neuroreceptor.<br>
Glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain and plays a unique role in a variety of central nervous system (CNS) functions. The glutamate-dependent stimulus receptors are divided into two main groups. The first main group, namely the ionotropic receptors, forms ligand-controlled ion channels. The metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR) belong to the second main group and, furthermore, belong to the family of G-protein coupled receptors.<br>
At present, eight different members of these mGluR are known and of these some even have sub-types. According to their sequence homology, signal transduction mechanisms and agonist selectivity, these eight receptors can be sub-divided into three sub-groups:<br>
mGluRl and mGluR5 belong to group I, mGluR2 and mGluR3 belong to group II and mGluR4, mGluR6, mGluR7 and mGluR8 belong to group III.<br>
Ligands of metabotropic glutamate receptors belonging to the first group can be used for the treatment or prevention of acute and/or chronic neurological disorders such as psychosis, epilepsy, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, cognitive .disorders and memory deficits, as well as chronic and acute pain.<br>
Other treatable indications in this connection are restricted brain function caused by bypass operations or transplants, poor blood supply to the brain, spinal cord injuries, head injuries, hypoxia caused by pregnancy, cardiac arrest and hypoglycaemia. Further treatable indications are ischemia, Huntington's chorea, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), dementia caused by AIDS, eye injuries, retinopathy, idiopathic parkinsonisin or parkinsonism caused by medicaments as well as conditions which lead to glutarnate-deficiency functions, such as e.g. muscle spasms, convulsions, migraine, urinary incontinence, nicotine addiction, opiate addiction, anxiety, vomiting, dyskinesia and depressions.<br><br>
Disorders mediated fall or in part by mGluR5 are for example acute, traumatic and chronic degenerative processes of the nervous system, such as Alzheimer's disease, senile dementia, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's chorea, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis, psychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia and anxiety, depression, pain and drug dependency (Expert Opin. Ther. Patents (2002), 12, (12)).<br>
Selective mGluR5 antagonists are especially useful for the treatment of anxiety and pain.<br>
The invention relates to compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, to the above-mentioned compounds as pharmaceutically active substances and their production.<br>

Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds of formulae I, la and Ib can be manufactured readily according to methods known per se and taking into consideration the nature of the compound to be converted into a salt. Inorganic or organic acids such as, for example, hydrochloric acid, hydxobromic acid, sulphuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid or citric acid, formic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, acetic acid, succinic acid, tartaric acid, methanesulphonic acid, p-toluenesulphonic acid and the like are suitable for the formation of pharmaceutically acceptable salts of basic compounds of formula I. Compounds which contain the alkali metals or alkaline earth metals, for example sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium or the like, basic amines or basic amino acids are suitable for the formation of pharmaceutically acceptable salts of acidic compounds.<br>
The compounds of formulae I, la and Ib and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts are, as already mentioned above, metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonists and can be used for the treatment or prevention of mGluR5 receptor mediated disorders, such as acute and/or chronic neurological disorders, cognitive disorders and memory deficits, as well as acute and chronic pain. Treatable neurological disorders are for instance epilepsy, schizophrenia, anxiety, acute, traumatic or chronic degenerative processes of the nervous system, such as Alzheimer's disease, senile dementia, Huntington's chorea, ALS, multiple sclerosis, dementia caused by AIDS, eye injuries, retinopathy, idiopathic parkinsonism or parkinsonism caused by medicaments as well as conditions which lead to glutamate-deficient functions, such as e.g. muscle spasms, convulsions, migraine, urinary incontinence, ethanol addiction, nicotine addiction, psychoses, opiate addiction, anxiety, vomiting, dyskinesia and depression. Other treatable indications are restricted brain function caused by bypass operations or transplants, poor blood supply to the brain,<br><br>
spinal cord injuries, head injuries, hypoxia caused by pregnancy, cardiac arrest and hypoglycaemia. Other treatable indications are protection against liver damage, failure whether drug or disease induced, urinary incontinence, obesity, Fragile-X or Autism.<br>
In addition, it is proposed that mGlu5 receptor antagonists protect against liver damage / failure whether drug or disease induced.<br>

The pharmacological activity of the compounds was tested using the following method:<br>
For binding experiments, cDNA encoding human mGlu 5a receptor was transiently transfected into EBNA cells using a procedure described by Schlaeger and Christensen [Cytotechnology 15:1-13 (1998)]. Cell membrane homogenates were stored at -80°C until the day of assay where upon they were thawed and resuspended and polytronised in<br><br>
15 mM Tris-HO, 120 mM NaCl, 100 mM KC1, 25 m-M CaC32, 25 mM MgCl2 binding buffer at pH 7.4 to a final assay concentration of 20μg protein/ well.<br>
Saturation isotherms were determined by addition of twelve [ H] MPEP concentrations (0.04-100 nM) to these membranes (in a total volume of 200μl) for 1 h at 4°C. Competition experiments were performed with a fixed concentration of [3 H]MPEP (2nM) and IC50 values of test compounds evaluated using 11 concentrations (0.3-10,000nM). Incubations were performed for 1 h at 4° C.<br>
At the end of the incubation, membranes were filtered onto unifilter (96-well white microplate with bonded GF/C filter preincubated 1 h in 0.1% PEI in wash buffer, Packard BioScience, Meriden, CT) with a Filtermate 96 harvester (Packard BioScience) and washed 3 times with cold 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 buffer. Nonspecific binding was<br>
measured in the presence of 10 ΜM MPEP. The radioactivity on the filter was counted (3 min) on a Packard Top-count microplate scintillation counter with quenching correction after addition of 45 μ of microscint 40 (Canberra Packard S.A., Zurich, Switzerland) and shaking for 20 min.<br>
For functional assays, [Ca ji measurements were performed as described previously by Porter et al. [Br. J. Pharmacol. 128:13-20 (1999)] on recombinant human mGlu 5a receptors in HEK-293 cells. The cells were dye loaded using Fluo 4-AM<br>
(obtainable by FLUKA, 0.2μM final concentration). [Ca2+] measurements were performed using a fluorometric imaging plate reader (FLIPR, Molecular Devices Corporation, La Jolla, CA, USA). Antagonist evaluation was performed following a 5 min preincubation with the test compounds followed by the addition of a submaximal addition of agonist.<br>
The inhibition (antagonists) curves were fitted with a four parameter logistic equation giving ICso, and Hill coefficient using iterative non linear curve fitting software<br>
(Xcel fit).<br>
For binding experiments the Ki values of the compounds tested are given. The Ki value is defined by the following formula:<br>
in which the IC50 values are those concentrations of the compounds tested which cause 50 % inhibition of the competing radioligand ([ HjMPEP). L is the concentration of<br><br>
radioligand used in the binding experiment and the Ka value of the radioligand is empirically determined for each batch of membranes prepared.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are mGluR 5a receptor antagonists. The activities of compounds of formulae I, la and Ib as measured in the assay described above and as presented in the table hereafter are in the range of Ki 
 <br>
The compounds of formulae I, la and Ib and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof can be used as medicaments, e.g. in the form of pharmaceutical preparations. The pharmaceutical preparations can be administered orally, e.g. in the form of tablets, coated tablets, dragees, hard and soft gelatine capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions. However, the administration can also be effected rectally, e.g. in the form of suppositories, or parenterally, e.g. in the form, of injection solutions.<br>
The compounds of formula I, la and Ib and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof can be processed with pharmaceutically inert, inorganic or organic carriers for the production of pharmaceutical preparations. Lactose, corn starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acid or its salts and the like can be used, for example, as such as carriers for tablets, coated tablets, dragees and hard gelatine capsules. Suitable carriers for soft gelatine capsules are, for example, vegetable oils, waxes, fats, semi-solid and liquid polyols and the like; depending on the nature of the active substance no carriers are, however, usually required in the case of soft gelatine capsules. Suitable carriers for the production of solutions and syrups are, for example, water, polyols, sucrose, invert sugar, glucose and the like. Adjuvants, such as alcohols, polyols, glycerol, vegetable oils and the like, can be used for aqueous injection solutions of water-soluble salts of compounds of formula I,<br><br>
but as a rule are not necessary. Suitable carriers for suppositories are, for example, natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats, semi-liquid or liquid polyols and the like.<br>
In addition, the pharmaceutical preparations can contain preservatives, solubilizers, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, sweeteners, colorants, flavorants, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffers, masking agents or antioxidants. They can also contain still other therapeutically valuable substances.<br>
As mentioned earlier, medicaments containing a compound of formula I or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof and a therapeutically inert excipient are also an object of the present invention, as is a process for the production of such medicaments which comprises bringing one or more compounds of formula I or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof and, if desired, one or more other therapeutically valuable substances into a galenical dosage form together with one or more therapeutically inert carriers.<br>
The dosage can vary within wide limits and will, of course, be fitted to the individual requirements in each particular case. In general, the effective dosage for oral or parenteral administration is between 0.01-20 mg/kg/day, with a dosage of 0.1-10 mg/ kg/day being preferred for all of the indications described. The daily dosage for an adult human being weighing 70 kg accordingly lies between 0.7-1400 mg per day, preferably between 7 and 700 mg per day.<br>

Example A<br>
(Z)-2-Acetylamino-3-diinethylam.ino-but-2-enoic acid ethyl ester In this example of the compound X, R and R are both methyl. Nevertheless, it is understood that the person skilled in the art would be able to prepare other compounds of formula X, wherein R2 and R4 axe other than methyl using the method of the following example:<br>
Step 1: 4-1 l-Dimethylamino-eth-(Z)-ylidene]-2-methyl-4H-oxazol-5-one N-Acetylglycine (10.0 g, 85.4 mmol) and Phosphoroxychloride (19.6 ml, 213.5 mmol) were mixed and cooled to 5°C. N',N-Dimethylacetamide (19.7 ml, 213.5 mmol) was added drop-wise slowly during 30 min at 5-10°C (exothermic!). The reaction mixture was stirred at 45°C for 2 hrs and then cooled to room temperature. Dichloromethane (35 ml) was added and the mixture poured into 200 ml ice-water. The pH was adjusted to pH 8 with ammonium hydroxide and the mixture was extracted twice with 50 ml dichloromethane. The organic extracts were washed with 30 ml water, dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and evaporated. The crude product was purified by column chromatography on silica gel (ethyl acetate) and the desired compound was obtained as a light brown solid (7.40 g, 51%), MS: m/e = 169.2 (M+H+).<br>
Step 2: (Z)-2-Acetylamino-3-dimethylamino-but-2-enoic acid ethyl ester 4-[l-Dimethylamino-eth-(Z)-ylidene]-2-methyl-4H-oxazol-5-one (7.4 g, 44.0 mmol) was dissolved in ethanol (50 ml) and sodium hydride (0.l0g, 4.4 mmol) was added at room temperature. The dark solution was refluxed for lh. The solvent was evaporated and the crude product [MS: m/e = 215.5 (M+H+)] was used without any further purification for the next step.<br>
Example B 5-Iodo-2,4-dimethyl-lH-imidazole<br>
In this example of the compound XIX, R6 is methyl, R4 is methyl, and X is chloro. Nevertheless it is understood that the person skilled in the art would be able to prepare other compounds of formula XIX, wherein R2 and R4 are other than methyl, and X is other than chloro, using the method used for in the following example: 2,4-Dimethylrmidazole (5.0g, 52 mmol) was suspended in 100 ml Acetonitrile and N-Iodosuccinimide (14.0g, 62.4 mmol) was added. The reaction mixture was stirred at reflux for 16 hours, then evaporated and decolorized with sat NaHSO3 solution. Water was added and extracted two times with 100 ml ethyl acetate. The organic layers were washed with Brine, dried with sodium sulfate and evaporated. The crude product was<br><br>
purified by cinematography on silica gel (dichloromethane/methanol 9:1). The desired product was obtained as a light brown solid (5.10 g, 44%), MS: m/e = 223.0 (M-f H+).<br>
