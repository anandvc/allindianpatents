(SECTION 10)<br><br><br><br>
"A process for preparing a new antioxidant formulation for treatment of acute myocardial Infarction for prevention of remodeling and heart<br>
failure"<br>
Prof. Ram Bahadur Singh, Prof. Adarsh Kumar and Dr. Mohammed Arif, all Indian Citizens of Shiv Niketan, 1st Floor, Flat No. 7,18th Road, Khar West, Mumbai -<br>
400050, Maharashtra, India<br><br><br>
The following specification particularly describes and ascertains the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br><br><br><br>
This invention relates to a process lord preparing a new antioxidant formulation for treatment of acute myocardial infarction for prevention of remodeling and heart failure.<br>
Background:<br>
Oxidative damage in association with antioxidant deficiency have been observed in patients with AMI. Super oxide and hydroxyl radicals and hydrogen peroxides are important reactive oxygen species in the pathogenesis of cardiac damage resulting remodeling and heart failure among these patients (1-4).Case control studies indicate that there is a deficiency of antioxidant vitamins A,E,C and beta-carotene, CoQ10,lycopene and increased free radical damage in the form of higher thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, MDA and Diane conjugates in patients with AMI and heart failure(l-5).CoQ10 and trimetazidine are potent antioxidant agents which are known to increase the production of ATP and energy in the myocardial cell(3-6). It is possible that antioxidant and bioenergetics activity of these agents may have synergistic effects in patients with AMI because these patients are known to have enormous amount of free radical stress and low level of ATP due to myocardial ischemia. Addition of stations to this combination may further enhance this activity and improve endothelial function which is beneficial in these patients. No other study has examined the role of antioxidants, bioenergetics and stations in combination in patients with AMI and heart failure. The role of Coquito in heart failure and the effect of trimetazidine in coronary artery disease(CAD) are known however the dosages and efficacy are controversial.<br>
The object of this invention is to examine the role of this combination of antioxidants in patients with AMI for prevention of remodeling in AMI and in a<br><br>
 sub-study to find out whether it is also beneficial and safe in conjunction with statin and thereafter develop a composition for the treatment of AMI and prevention of remodeling and heart failure.<br>
To achieve said objective, the present invention provides a process for preparing a new synergistic antioxidant formulation for treatment of acute myocardial infarction for prevention of remodeling and heart failure comprising mixing the following anti-oxidants in the proportions indicated there against:<br>
Coenzyme Q10 (Ubiquinone)   -        45 % - 57.5% by wt.<br>
Trimetazidine	-        30 % - 40.0% by wt.<br>
Lovastatin	-        1.5% -15% by wt.<br>
and the balance if any adding a conventional filler for preparing the tablet or capsule.<br>
Said filler used is cellulose.<br>
The proportions in which the ingredients are mixed in the anti-oxidant composition are as follows:<br>
Coenzyme Q10 (Ubiquinone)   -        57.14 % by wt.<br>
Trimetazidine	-        38.1 % by wt.<br>
Lovastatin	-        4.76% by wt.<br>
The proportions in which the ingredients are mixed in the anti-oxidant composition are as follows:<br>
Coenzyme Q10 (Ubiquinone)	-	45.28% by wt.<br>
Trimetazidine	-	30.18 % by wt.<br>
Lovastatin	-	1.9%bywt.<br>
Cellulose	.	-	22.64% by wt<br><br>
The proportions in which the ingredients are mixed in the anti-oxidant composition are as follows:<br>
Coenzyme Q10 (Ubiquinone)    -	56.25 % by wt.<br>
Trimetazidine	-        37.5 % by wt.<br>
Lovastatin	-        6.25 % by wt.<br>
The proportions in which the ingredients are mixed in the anti-oxidant composition are as follows:<br>
Coenzyme Q10 (Ubiquinone)	-	50%bywt.<br>
Trimetazidine	-	33.3% by wt.<br>
Lovastatin	-	4.2 % by wt.<br>

CLINICAL TRIALS FOR DEVELOPMENT OF PROCESS:<br>
The effects of individual ingredients in moderate, higher and in combination were studied by administering coenzyme Ql0+trimetazidine in single and double blind trials with and without control groups for a period of 4 weeks to study their synergistic effects (Tables 1-5). A randomized, double blind trial was conducted in 73 intervention and 71 control group patients of AMI for treatment and prevention of remodeling and heart failure during a follow up of 24 weeks. Results were also calculated after 4 weeks.<br>
1.	Effects of individual antioxidants in moderate doses:<br>
We administered coenzyme QIO (60 mg/day), trimetazidine (40mg/Day) and lovastatin. (10 mg/day) after randomizing the subjects into three groups (Table 1). There was a modest reduction in TBARS, MDA and Diane conjugates in the coenzyme QIO group, doubtful beneficial effect in the trimetazidine group and no effect in lovastatin group. The changes were nonsignificant.<br>
2.	Effects of individual antioxidants in higher doses:<br>
Subjects were randomized in to three groups in a double blind fashion. They were administered, coenzyme QIO (120 mg/day) or trimetazidine(80 mg/day) or lovastatin (10 mg/day) in the concerned group for a period of 4 weeks. Treatment with coenzyme QIO was associated with substantial reduction in TBARS, MDA and Diane conjugates and an increase in vitamin E,C and beta-carotene (Table 2). Treatment with trimetazidine also caused substantial changes but slightly lower than coenzyme QIO. Lovastatin had nej:UraLclicet.<br>
3.	Effects of two combined antioxidant formulation in higher doses:<br>
Subjects were randomized into three groups (after a wash out period of 4 weeks) in a double blind fashion. They were administered coenzyme QIO t<br><br><br>
trimetazidine. Coenzyme Q l0+lovastatin and trimetazidine +  lovastatin. There was a substantial reduction in TBARS, MDA and Diane conjugates and  increase  in   Vitamin  E,C  and  beta  carotene  indicating  that  some synergistic effect is possible. 4.   Effect of three combined antioxidant formulations in various doses:<br>
Subjects were randomized into three groups as given table 4 and were administered various combinations of formulations in a double blind fashion for 4 weeks. High dose combination of coenzyme Q10 (200 mg) +trimetazidine (80 mg) +lovastatin (10 mg) per day showed a marked reduction in TBARS, MDA and Diane conjugates and increase in vitamins E,C and beta carotene but lower compared to high dose combination.<br>
Study Methods:<br>
Patients of CAD were recruited by giving advertisements in the newspapers that heart disease may be slowed by treatment with antioxidants and antianginal drugs may be stopped in some patients. The diagnosis of CAD was based on available record indicating CAD. The main criteria for inclusion in the study was a serum creatinine level of 
Subjects and Methods for Final Trial:<br>
Clinical trial in patients with AMI were conducted to determine the effective dosage and combinations. Finally, subjects (n- 144) with proven AMI were stratified into anterior or inferior AMI of at the most 72 hours duration and were<br><br><br>
randomly divided into antioxidant (n=73) and control (n=71) groups by blindly<br>
selecting a card.<br>
Treatment:<br>
The test agent antioxidant coenzyme Q10, trimetazidine and lovastatin are marketed as health products in most industrialized countries and are used for the treatment of heart attack and heart failure and other illnesses indicating that they are safe for human trial. The placebo capsules containing inert fibre were supplied from our laboratory. All patients in the treatment group (group A) were given two capsules twice daily. The placebo capsules (two, twice daily) containing inert fibre were administered to all patients in the placebo group B. The test capsules were identical in shape, size and colour for both groups and were provided to patients in containers marked group A or B that were identical in all other respects. Compliance was monitored by counting the number of capsules returned by the patients from either container, A or B on follow-up visits or on each day during hospitalization. All other advises on treatments were similar in both groups who met for checkup to physician blind to groups.<br>
Study Design for Trial in AMI:<br>
All the patients with the diagnosis of AMI or unstable angina were randomized to two groups. The study was approved by the ethics committee of human studies in our center. After written informed consent, all patients with the above diagnosis were randomized by the pharmacist to receive either antioxidant capsules or placebo capsules. The physician examining the patients and technicians analyzing the blood were blinded to treatment groups. All patients were asked to select blindly one of the cards, each enclosed in a sealed envelope and marked either group A or B. The intervention group A (n=73) received antioxidant formulation (2 cap twice daily) and the placebo group B (n  71)<br><br>
received inert fibre cellulose (2 cap twice daily, 52.5 mg each) for a period of 4 and 24 weeks. All other treatments such as trinitrates, aspirin, streptokinase, beta blockers, A,C, E inhibitors were administered to both the groups. All patients were followed weekly for 4 weeks and then every 4 weekly for 12 weeks.<br>
Clinical, echocardiographic, radiologic and laboratory data were recorded at admission before entry to the study. Hypertension was defined as blood pressure &gt; 140/90 mm/Hg and hypotension as systolic blood pressure 140 mm/Hg systolic and or &gt;90 mm/Hg diastolic with an attempt to maintain blood pressure 
A blood sample after at least 10 hours of fasting was drawn at entry and then 4, 8 and 12 week of follow up in the morning and was analyzed for blood count, cardiac enzymes, T vitamin, E and C and beta-carotene and thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS), Diane conjugates and malondialdehyde (MDA) (16-20). Laboratory personnel analyzing the blood were blind to groups. Statistical analysis:<br>
The two-sample t-test using one-way analysis of variance and the Z score for proportions were used to measure the statistical significance between the two   groups.   Turnkeys   post-hoc   test   was   also   conducted    for   multiple<br><br>
comparisons. Only a P. Value 
significant. Data were analyzed on the basis of intention to treat.<br>
RESULTS:<br>
The new process revealed that a combination of coenzyme QIO (120mg/day)+<br>
trimetazidine (80mg/day) in the given doses due to their synergistic effect was<br>
most effective combination. Data were analyzed after dividing the subjects into 2<br>
groups; antioxidant group (n=73)and placebo group(n=71). Antioxidant group<br>
showed a significant decline in TBARS,MDA and Diane conjugates and a<br>
significant increase in antioxidant vitamins E,C and beta-carotene.<br>
Effect on Cardiac Events: After 4 weeks of follow-up on treatment with this new<br>
formulation, there was a significant decrease in the total cardiac events including<br>
nonfatal myocardial infarction and deaths in the antioxidant group compared to<br>
control group (15% vs 30.9%,P
arrhythmias and left ventricular dysfunction were not significantly different at<br>
entry to the study. However after 4 weeks, CoQ + trimetazidine group showed<br>
significant benefit in cardiac events and all other parameters including left<br>
ventricular dysfunction (table 7-9 ).The subgroup within group A taking lovastatin<br>
showed greater benefit in all these parameters compared to the group not taking<br>
lovastatin.<br>
Effects on Remodeling:<br>
Subgroup having poor ejection fraction showed significant decrease in all the<br>
echocardiographic parameters indicating reduction in remodelling compared to the<br>
control group. However, antioxidant group as a whole and subjects with low<br>
ejection fraction(
the control group. No serious adverse effects were observed.<br>
The composition prepared according to the process of the present invention results in a synergistic composition.<br><br><br>
Effective Range of Dosages of Various Agents:<br>
Table 5 shows that optimal dosages for reversing oxidative damage in patients with CAD were: coenzyme QIO, 120 mg/day, trimetazidine (80 mg/day) and lovastatin (10 mg/day). It is clear that the effective ranges of doses of these agents in a combination should be: coenzyme Q10,60-120mg/day, trimetazidine, 40-80 mg/day, lovastatin 10-12 mg/day. In mg/kg body weight the dosages could be coenzyme Q10, 2mg, trimetazidine, 1.34 mg and lovastatin, 0.17 mg/day. DISCUSSION :<br>
This study shows that the proposed newly processed antioxidant formulation with new dosages was effective and the content have synergistic effects. Treatment with this combined antioxidant formulation containing coenzyme Q10, trimetazidine and in a subgroup in patients with AMI was associated with a significant decline in oxidative damage leading to beneficial effect on angina, arrhythmia's, heart failure and remodeling after 4 and 24 weeks of follow-up in the antioxidant groups compared to control groups (Table 7-10). No published evidence is available to demonstrate the role of antioxidants and stations in-patients with AMI. It is therefore possible that in patients with AMI, with or without low ejection fraction treatment with antioxidants and stations may have reverse oxidative damage due to its potent antioxidant and ATP sparing (bioenergetics) effects and their synergistic activity in our patients. The protective effects were apparent within 4 weeks of therapy with antioxidants indicating that the effect may be on myocardial and coronary artery endothelial function, thrombosis and left ventricular function. The benefit may also be due to anti-inflammatory and membrane stabilizing activity of antioxidants. In case control studies, plasma levels of coenzyme Q10 and vitamin A,K and C,  selenium, lycopene,  and antioxidant enzymes such as<br><br>
superoxide dismutase, catalase etc. were inversely associated with AMI and heart failure. Deficiency of vitamin E and C and beta-carotene and oxidative damage in the form of high TBARS, malondialdehyde and Diane conjugates were also observed in our study in both the groups indicating that oxidative stress may be an important mechanism of myocardial injury and oxidative damage(21-26).<br>
Experimental studies have incriminated reactive oxygen species as primary mediators in the pathogenesis of ischemic, toxic and immunologically mediated in reperfusion myocardial cell injury.(l-4) Overproduction of free radicals by blood borne cells or myocardial cells in presence of poor expression of antioxidant enzymes(5-7) can promote both direct oxidant injury and indirect effects including activation and potentiation of inflammatory mediators. Among characteristics are more leads to chronic inflammation. Cell injury is characterized with first by efflux of adenine metabolites, CPK enzymes and decline in ATP levels and then by cell detachment and cell lysis. The ability of antioxidants to decrease the loss of myocardial function as a result of oxidative injury appears to be due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and ATP generation by CoQ10.<br>
There is evidence of a synergistic action of coenzyme Q10+ trimetazidine as well as of lovastatin in experimental studies and coenzyme Q10 can spare vitamin E in the tissues on treatment. Antioxidant bioenergetics supplementation in patients with AMI and heart failure might prevent ultimate heart failure. It may interfere with disease progression or it may reverse partial cardiac damage by cell growth and at least it may slow down the deteriorating cardiac function to a more acceptable rate. Antioxidant bioenergetics statin combination may have no ellect on scarred myocardium but can prevent cell dvsfunction.<br>
In brief the findings of our trial indicate that the newly processed antioxidant   bioenergetics   formulation   in   a   new   dosage   form   can   reverse<br><br>
oxidative damage, decrease cardiac events, heart failure, angina pectoris, arrhythmia's as well as remodeling and heart failure in patients with failure in patients with AMI.<br>
Conclusions: Treatment with newly processed antioxidant and bioenergetics formulation in given dosages due to a synergistic effect reduces oxidative damage and cardiac events, remodeling and heart failure in the treatment group than control group.<br><br>
