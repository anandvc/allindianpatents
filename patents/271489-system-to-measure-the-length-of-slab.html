				<td>Field of the invention<br>
The present invention is directed to measurement of length of slab for cutting into<br>
different base length in continuous casting units and in particular to a cost effective<br>
system for measuring the length of slabs for cutting into desired different base lengths.<br>
Importantly, the system of the invention involves low cost silicon photo sensor based<br>
slab length measuring system which would be adapted to directiy and effectively<br>
measure the slab length at continuous casting unit thereby minimizing the generation of<br>
plate scrap in plate mills of steel plants. Thus the invention is directed to make the<br>
measurement and cutting of slab in steel plants user friendly, cost effective and reliable.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
It is well known that in steel plants molten steet is continuously cast into slabs. Usually<br>
after passing through accelerated water spray system, the slabs are gradually dragged<br>
and rolled down to ground level where they are art into 170 different base lengths,<br>
ranging from 5.5 m to 10.5m by means of gas cutting torches to meet the varying needs<br>
of the plate mills. At SBS stage slabs of CCS are further cut into three pieces (base<br>
lengths) in the range of 1.8m to 3.6m.<br>
The above process of cutting of slabs Involving gas cutting torches suffers from several<br>
inherent drawbacks /deficiencies. In particular, in this process (i) from 5.5m to 7.5m<br>
there, is no measuring system at all because of the movement of the gas flame which<br>
destroys the sensing device, and (if) from 7.5m onwartfs, the slabs use the contact type<br>
sensors which have additional problems of (a) metaflic rod gets damaged due to hitting<br>
of front end of bent slab, b) deposition of carbon particles on metallic rod which breaks<br>
the continuity of circuit, (c) it needs about minimum 500mm. gap between two<br>
successive slabs, For the above reasons, it is difficult to change the slab length after<br>
every half art hour by adjusting existing hanging metallic contact.<br>
Other measuring devices such as shaft encoder have further limitations which in dude<br>
tear and wear of rolls, non-contact / slip between roll and slab, glitches and unmeasured<br>
pulses, failure of couplings, hydraulically pressed rom requiring continuous adjustment<br>
and the necessity of cooling.<br>
Moreover, the laser based systems have limitations which include tilting of reflecting<br>
plane of moving slab, dust on tens causing system failure. The laser measuring system<br>
2<br><br><br>
based on time of flight principle need for continuous adjustment, complex circuitry to be<br>
maintained, requirement of the front end of the slab to be visible from the laser source,<br>
but hardly any gap between two successive pieces and it needs firstly 0.001 nano second<br>
timer for measuring slab length in mm and secondly it needs reflective surface which is<br>
not possible in steel product at semi finished stage-<br>
The CCD camera system also has its own limitation which includes the difficulty to sense<br>
the edges of slab and its scaling factor ranging from l:100/1000 need obstruction free<br>
area to view which fs not possible en the shop floor, and other [imitations are continuous<br>
supply of water to cool its electronics components, requirement of huge structure for<br>
installing and the need at least 500mm gap between two slabs.<br>
The roads cell based measuring system are also in use whfch again have problems such<br>
as requiring major installation work, requiring continuous calibration, indirect method<br>
calculate length by dividing weight / volume by its cross section, the cross section which<br>
itself varies +/- 10%.<br>
The Orbis Coll based measurement is found bo be not complete and reliable since while<br>
total cross section can be measured. However, the height or width of the object can not<br>
be measured. Also, the system does not work at higher speed, have poor response type<br>
and ft Is difficult to install and maintain existing mills and need huge gap between two<br>
pieces.<br>
Apart from the respective drawback / deficiency of the existing measuring devices made<br>
available to the art discussed about, all such conventional systems suffer from above<br>
said problems which tend to affect quality of the measurement apart from also being<br>
cost extensive.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is thus basic object of the present invention to provide a system for measuring of the<br>
length of the slab and its cutting into different base lengths which would be reliable in<br>

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Thus according to the basic aspect of the present invention there is provided a system<br>
for measuring the length of 3 stab and its cutting into desired different base lengths<br>
comprising:<br>
sensor stacks comprising plurality of photo sensor assemblies each said photo sensor<br>
assembly housed within an ordinary wooden block having a silicon phototransistor<br>
operatively connected bo a convex lens based optical amplification means and a<br>
cooperative wooden focusing tube said sensor assemblies arranged along a desired<br>
variable length for the monitoring and cutting of the slabs ;<br>
said sensor stacks operatively connected to corresponding LED display for indicating the<br>
length of the advancing slab through glowing of the LEPs upon sensing of the slab length<br>
by the multipte /170 nos. sensors;<br>
5<br><br>
each said LED in the length display unit having an associated length indication switches<br>
for selecting the desired slab length for cutting;<br>
means for selectivity positioning a gas cutting trolley for slab cutting based on the<br>
selected desired length of the steb as per the length selecting switch.<br>
In the above system the said convex lens based optical amplification means comprises a<br>
convex lens having + 45 optical amplification for sensing even little radiation from low<br>
temperature slabs.<br>
It is possible by way of me above system to cover about 5000 mm variation in slab<br>
length by arranging 170 numbers silicon photo transistors at an intervals of about 30mm<br>
in a sensor stack.The photoelectric current is sent through heat resistant cable to<br>
electronic processing unit wherein the weak signals of the photo sensors are amplified, a<br>
comparator circuit dips the photo voltage due to the surrounding light, the output<br>
current of the comparator circuit of operational amplifier iliuminate the different LEDs in<br>
the length display and control unit.<br>
The system ensures that on arrival of slab before respective photo sensor charme?<br>
(tube) , it Is displayed by means of the glowing LEDs which are installed in the slab<br>
length display unit in the pulpit.<br>
The photo sensor used in the system selectively comprises of slicon photo sensors<br>
configured in darlington pair with in built convex lens of +2 mm focal length.<br>
The light ray of the front end of moving slab gradually advances over photo translstor<br>
stack and the same is indicated by the glowing of different light emitting diodes of length<br>
display unit after processing through operabonai amplifiers and filter circuit.Each said<br>
light emitting diode and associated lengtfi selector switches are provided for their<br>
respective slab length with reference to the gas cutting touch.Preferably the sensor stack<br>
is put dose to the slab for minimiztng the measuring error.<br>
Importantly in accordance with an aspect tfte means for selectively positioning a gas<br>
cutting trottey comprises means for sensing the deviation of trolley from Its initial<br>
position including a sensor stack comprising of plurality of sensors preferably about 10<br>
sensors arranged at intervals preferably about 10 mm from one side of the shadow<br>
provider ,preferably a metallic strip projected from the trolley, and a bunch of LEDs are<br>
6<br><br>
kept at the other side, such that in case of any deviation of trolley from its initial position<br>
is observed in the glowing of the LEDs the same is indicative for the operator to<br>
activated corrective measures by selecting the corresponding stab length selection<br>
switch.<br>
The velocity of the gas cuffing torches in the cutting trolley are synchronized with<br>
casting velocity by means of a gripper mechanism adapted to grip the stab and force<br>
trolley to move, after cutting the slab, the gripper mechanism is adapted to be released<br>
from the streams of cast slabs and the gas cutting trolley returns to its initial position to<br>
grip and wait for incoming stream of slab for storing cutting process.<br>
in accordance with another aspect of the invention there is provided a photo sensor<br>
assembly for measuring steb length having temperature m the range of 400ºC to 1100°C<br>
comprising a wooden rectangular shaped block housing havlng a silicon phototransistor<br>
operatively connected to a convex lens based optical amplification means to sense slab<br>
of Power temperature and a cooperative long wooden focusing tube for sensing stab of<br>
higher temperatures.<br>
The said convex lens based optical amplification means comprises a convex lens having<br>
+ 45 optical amplification for sensing even little radiation from low temperature slabs.<br>
The stated said wooden tube comprises of a wooden tube preferably mare length but<br>
having smaller diameter.<br>
It is thus possible by way of the above disclosed system to carry out the measurement<br>
of length of slab and cutting into desired lengths involving multiple discreet sensors<br>
avoiding the normally optical sensor are used for sensing the presence of luminous /<br>
non-luminous object. The system of the invention and the method for measurement and<br>
stab cutting aivd using the same enables achieving measuring error less than 0.l% which<br>
is comparable with other measuring system.<br>
Importantly, also the system of the invention advantageously provides for selective use<br>
of sensors which would be cost effective and the soft wooden block provided to keep<br>
accessories like photo transistor sensor, lens and light emitting diodes and focusing tube<br>
Is made in wood itsetf by drilling entire wooden block centrally. This is a compfete<br>
deviation from the cost extensive and extremely hard bakelite block used for photo<br>
sensing elements known in the art. More importantly, it is unexpectedly and surprisingly<br>
found try way of the present invention that wooden block used to keep the accessories<br>
7<br><br>
does not suffer from any adverse effect even at high hot slab temperature of about<br>
1100°C. Moreover, the system of the invention would favour pin pointing the movement<br>
of the hot as well as cold slab by the same sensor by way of tts fabrication in long<br>
wooden tubes and avoids problems of false measurement.<br>
Moreover advantageously by way of the selective silicon photo transistor in combination<br>
with tive bi- convex lens of magrifyinig power +45° it is possible to measure slabs having<br>
temperature even of the onder of the 400º by collecting the very weak radiation from<br>
slab by using bl-convex lens. Thus the above defective combination avoids limitations of<br>
conventional silicon sensor which are sensitive to only red / higher intensity of infrared<br>
energy 550°C above temperature range).<br>
The system does not require arty calibration in me span of time since it ?s 1:1 scaling<br>
between coordinate of slab and photo sensor array. There 15 also no n£ed for cooling of<br>
the sensing unit.<br>
It is thus possible to provide a low cost, highly reliable contact less dimensional<br>
measuring and controlling system since operator can select any slab length from the<br>
pulpit Itself without requirement going outside after every 20 minutes or heat change<br>
(whichever is lesser) for seeing the stab length.<br>
The least count of measurement can also be adjusted as per accuracy desired by<br>
Increasing me number of sensor. Presently, measuring error found in the art of upto<br>
0.3% can be advantageousily reduced by further increasing the number of sensors.<br>
The system therefore utifces Independent sensors to focus arid sense the stab along with<br>
possible automatic length control. Advantageously the use of the wooden housing for the<br>
sensor provides the system with the ability to sustain high degree of vibration and<br>
requires pjacticalty zero maintenance.<br>
Besides improving the yields, the system of the invention is further directed to uplift the<br>
working condition by relieving the excessive heat, dust and also from accidents from<br>
fatigue operations involved in different processes. The system and method achieves<br>
optimization for cutting of the slab of desired levels with minimum amount plate scrap in<br>
cutting a strand of slab into separate pieces.<br>
8<br><br>
The reliability and accuracy of the system is such that there is no variation in accuracy in<br>
the slab measurement over period of time, importantly to the system reduces the<br>
tolerances of the slab length as well as it reduces the slab / plate scrap.<br>
The system of the invention is safe since it is usually installed 1m away from the hot slab<br>
and work satisfactorily even a minute gap of the order of 50mm, possible in between<br>
successive slabs. The selector switches enabte selecting of the slab length such as<br>
between. 5.5m to 10.57m. in comibination with multiple photo sensor. Advantageously,<br>
considering the bouncing of troltey have been displayed before the operator thereby<br>
immediate correction can be taken by length selector switches as there is no need of the<br>
operator for manually shifting the metallic contact as in the case of the earlier installed<br>
system.<br>
The details of the invention its object and advantages are explained hereunder in greater<br>
details in relation to norHimitfng exemplary illustration of the system and the method of<br>
measurement of sfab length and cutting of slab as per the following accompanying<br>
figures:<br>

and<br>
Figure 9: is a slab length display unit.<br>
Reference is, first invited to accompanying figures 1 to 3 which is a schematic<br>
representation of a slab caster. As shown in said figure the slab caster is adapted to<br>
continuously cast the molten steel into slabs of desired dimension. After passing through<br>
accelerated water spray system the slabs are gradually dragged and rolled down to<br>
ground level where they are cut into 170 different base length ranging from 5-5m to<br>
10.5m long by means of gas cutting torches so as to meet the diverged needs of plate<br>
9<br><br>
mills. Customer of all over world at slafc storage stage, slabs or CCS are further cut into<br>
three pieces, base length of the range 1.8m to 3.6m.<br>
It would toe apparent from the above that in the system as above between 5.5m to<br>
7.5m. there is no measuring system at all because of the movement of the gas flame.<br>
From 7.5m. onwards there is use of contact type of sensor which has accompanying<br>
problems such as frequent metallic rod damages, deposition of carbon particles and need<br>
for a 500m gap between two successive slabs.<br>
Importantly, usually a wide variation in temperature (400°C to 11OO°C) at slab surface is<br>
known due to coating of casting powder, scale formation and fluctuation of casting<br>
speed. It is thus known bo be belter to detect the slab of low temperature by using the<br>
Germanian photo sensor which is usually sensitive to low temperature radiation but their<br>
electrical behavior is unstable at higher temperature. On the other hand the presently<br>
available silicon photo sensors are stable at a higher operative temperature. But Its<br>
sensitivity is limited in visible and higher intensity of infra red radiation regions only.<br>
Normally, such silicon sensors sense object whose temperature is more than 550°C.<br>
In the backdrop of the above limitations, it is possible by way of the present invention to<br>
pTtrffde for a lov# tost photo sensor which would be effective in the wide temperature<br>
range of slab surfaces usually in the range of 4O0°c to 1100%.<br>
Reference, is nom invited to accompanying figure 4 which further illustrates the relative<br>
responses of the available Germanium photo sensor, silicon photo sensor and the<br>
modified convex lens accompanying silicon photo sensor of the present invention. As<br>
dearly illustrated in the said figure, by introducing optics the radiation fn the lower<br>
region of infra red region can be sensed even through the silicon photo transistor based<br>
sensor assembly of the invention vis-a-vis Germanium photo sensor which although can<br>
sence such radiation but is extremely cost extensive.<br>
Reference is Invited to accompanying figure 5 which illustrate photo sensor assembly<br>
(intermediate stage) in accordance with the present invention. As illustrated in the said<br>
figure, the photo sensor assembly Is specificaPFy adopted to suit measurement in wide<br>
temperature range. Thus while the silicon photo transistor (SPT) is shown provided in<br>
the sensor assembly which by itself is usually capable of sensing temperature more than<br>
550ºCAdvantageously, however, the photo sensor assembly of the invention selectively<br>
uses along witfi the silicon photo transistor a convex lens (CL) having +45 optical<br>
amplification whereby it is possible to also sense whatever little radiation emerged out<br>
10<br><br>
from the low temperature slab. Thus by introducing optics in the sensing process it is<br>
possible to sense the slab even of 400°C (radiation in the lower range of infra region)<br>
through sllicon photo transistor.<br>
Importantly, also as apparent from said figure 5 for focused sensing by the sensor<br>
(intermediate stage) a focusing tube (FT) is also provided. Further, in order to effectively<br>
sense the slab of higher temperature the said wooden tube is provided in the sensor<br>
assembly as otherwise it would have sensed the light which is reflected from the rolled<br>
table and other surrounding structure and lead to false sensing.<br>
The manner of slab measurement and slab cutting using the system of the invention is<br>
discussed hereunder in greater details in relation to the further accompanying figures 6<br>
to 9.<br>
The system for such stab length measurement and cutting of the present invention thus<br>
basically involves the following units; a) sensors stack, b) LED based slab length<br>
displaying units, c) Gas cutting trolley position sensing. The various units involved, in the<br>
system are further detailed hereunder.<br>
	a)	Sensor stack - By providing for the sensor stack it is possible to achieve<br>
		5000mm. variation of slab length which is covered by putting 170 nos. sEflcon<br>
		photo transistors at an interval of 30mm. in a sensor stack . The photo transistor<br>
		as explained above are put in the wooden blocks. Normally to protect Che<br>
		sensor's heat from hot object costiy bakelite material is used. However, for the<br>
		first time by way of present invention it is proposed to provide a low cost<br>
		wooden block for mounting me sensing unit (Photo transistor). Also as dearly<br>
		illustrated in Figure 5 in the same wooden block low cast powerful tens (+45<br>
		magnification) and also focusing tube are assembled and housed (in<br>
		intermediate development of sensor).<br>
		The photo electric current is sent through 0.2 sq. mm2 heat resistant cable to<br>
		electronic processing unit in which big signal of photo sensor are amplified.<br>
		Comparator's circuit is adapted to dick the photo voltage which is due to<br>
		surrounding light (fig. 6). The output current of comparator circuit LM 324<br>
		operational amplifier illuminate the LSJs (Light Emitting Diodes). On arrival of<br>
		bloom before respective photo sensor channel (tube), its shadow is displayed by<br>
		means or glowing the LEDs which are installed in the pulpit. Photo sensor type<br>
11<br><br>
		can be preferably 14 LF= 32 silicon photo transistors configured in Darlington pair<br>
		within bulit convex lens of +2mm. focal length.<br>
	b)	LED based slab length display unit: Light ray of front end of moving slab<br>
		gradually advances over photo transistor slack and same is indicated by glowing<br>
		different light emitting diodes of length display unit after processing through<br>
		operational amplifiers and filter circuit as shown in figure 6 to 9. Each light<br>
		emitting diodes and associated length selector switches meant for their<br>
		respective length with reference to gas cutting torch. For minimum measuring<br>
		error, sensors stack is disposed closed to the stack preferably about 170 nos.<br>
		LED alternate colours green / red can be put in display unit. Below each LED the<br>
		measured bloom length is written such as 5.5m., 5.530m, 10.570m. each LED is<br>
