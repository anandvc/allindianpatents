				<td>Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a novel compound which is capable of significantly improving a lifespan, efficiency, and electrochemical and thermal stabilities of an organic light emitting device, the production of the compound, and an organic light emitting device in which the compound is contained in an organic compound layer.<br>
Background Art<br>
An organic light emission phenomenon is an example of a conversion of current into visible rays through an internal process of a specific organic molecule. The organic light emission phenomenon is based on the following mechanism. When organic material layers are interposed between an anode and a cathode, if voltage is applied between the two electrodes, electrons and holes are injected from the cathode and the anode into the organic material layer. The electrons and the holes which are injected into the organic material layer are recombined to form an exciton, and the exciton is reduced to a bottom state to emit light. An organic light emitting device which is based on the above mechanism typically comprises a cathode, an anode, and organic material layer(s), for example, organic material layers including a hole injection layer, a hole transport layer, a light emitting layer, and an electron transport layer, interposed therebetween.<br>
The materials used in the organic light emitting device are mostly pure organic materials or complexes of organic material and metal. The material used in the organic light emitting device may be classified as a hole injection material, a hole transport material, a light emitting material, an electron transport material, or an electron injection material, according to its use. In connection with this, an organic material having a p-type property, which is easily oxidized and is electrochemically stable when it is oxidized, is mostly used as the hole injection material or the hole transport material. Meanwhile, an organic material having an n-type property, which is easily reduced and is electrochemically stable when it is reduced, is used as the electron injection material or the electron transport material. As the light emitting layer material, an organic material having both p-type and n-type properties is preferable, which is stable when it is oxidized and when it is reduced. Also a material having high light emission efficiency for conversion of the exciton into light when the exciton is formed is preferable.<br>
~\    -<br><br>
[5]	In addition, it is preferable that the material used in the organic light emitting device<br>
further have the following properties.<br>
[6]	First, it is preferable that the material used in the organic light emitting device have<br>
excellent thermal stability. The reason is that joule heat is generated by movement of electric charges in the organic light emitting device. NPB, which has recently been used as the hole transport layer material, has a glass transition temperature of 100°C or lower, thus it is difficult to apply to an organic light emitting device requiring a high current.<br>
[7]	Second, in order to produce an organic light emitting device that is capable of being<br>
actuated at low voltage and has high efficiency, holes and electrons which are injected into the organic light emitting device must be smoothly transported to a light emitting layer, and must not be released out of the light emitting layer. To achieve this, a material used in the organic light emitting device must have a proper band gap and a proper HOMO or LUMO energy levels. A LUMO energy level of PEDOT:PSS, which is currently used as a hole transport material of an organic light emitting device produced using a solution coating method, is lower than that of an organic material used as a light emitting layer material, thus it is difficult to produce an organic light emitting device having high efficiency and a long lifespan.<br>
[8]	Moreover, the material used in the organic light emitting device must have excellent<br>
chemical stability, electric charge mobility, and interfacial characteristic with an electrode or an adjacent layer. That is to say, the material used in the organic light emitting device must be little deformed by moisture or oxygen. Furthermore, proper hole or electron mobility must be assured so as to balance densities of the holes and of the electrons in the light emitting layer of the organic light emitting device to maximize the formation of excitons. Additionally, it has to be able to have a good interface with an electrode including metal or metal oxides so as to assure stability of the device.<br>

[85] Hereinafter, a detailed description will be given of the present invention.<br>
Various substituent groups are introduced into a core structure shown in Formula 1,<br>
[86] in detail, the core structure in which a fluorene group is bonded to a combination of an<br><br>
[87]    <br>
acridine group and a carbazolyl group up to form a spiro structure, thereby the compound of Formula 1 has characteristics suitable for application to an organic material layer used in an organic light emining device. This will be described in detail, below.<br>
	The steric core structure of the compound of Formula 1, for convenience of ex-	<br>
[88]<br><br>
planation, can be divided into two portions, A and B, as shown in the following Formula.<br>
[89]<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
[90]  	The compound of Formula 1 has the steric core structure in which a plane A meets <br>
[91]	  with a plane B at right angles around X, and conjugation does not occur between the A and B portions around X. Furthermore, since one nitrogen atom is positioned among three aryl groups in the plane B, conjugation is limited in the plane B.<br>
The conjugation length of the compound has a close relationship with an energy band gap. In detail, the energy band gap is reduced as the conjugation length of the <br>
[92]  	compound increases. As described above, since a conjugation structure is limited in the core structure of the compound of Formula 1, the core structure has a large energy band gap.<br>
As described above, in the present invention, various substituent groups are introduced to Rl to R17 positions of the core structure having the large energy band gap so as to produce compounds having various energy band gaps. Generally, it is easy to control an energy band gap by introducing substituent groups into a core structure having a large energy band gap, but it is difficult to significantly control the energy band gap by introducing substituent groups into a core structure having a small energy <br><br>
[93]	band gap. Furthermore, in the present invention, it is possible to control HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the compound by introducing various substituent groups into Rl to R17 of the core structure.<br>
, Additionally, by introducing various substituent groups into the core structure, compounds having intrinsic characteristics of the substituent groups can be obtained. For example, substituent groups, which are frequently applied to hole injeetion layer material, hole transport layer material, light emitting layer material, and electron transport layer materials during the production of the organic light emitting device, are introduced into the core structure so as to produce substances capable of satisfying the requirements of each organic material layer. Particularly, since the core structure of the compound of Formula 1 includes the arylamine structure, it has an energy level suitable for the hole injection and/or hole transport materials in the organic light emitting device. In the present invention, the compound having the proper energy level is selected depending on the substituent group among the compounds represented by<br><br>
Formula 1 to be used in the organic light emitting device, thereby it is possible to<br>
realize a device having a low actuating voltage and a high light efficiency.<br><br>
[94]	[94]	Furthermore, various substituent groups are symmetrically or asymmetrically<br>
introduced into the core structure so as to precisely control the energy band gap, and to<br>
improve interfacial characteristics with organic materials, thereby apply the compound<br>
to various fields.<br>
[95]	Additionally, various substituent groups are introduced into the steric structure of<br>
the compound of Formula 1 using spiro bonding to control the three-dimensional<br>
structure of the organic material so as to minimize π-π interaction in the organic<br>
material, thereby formation of excimers is prevented.<br>
[96]	Meanwhile, since the compound of Formula 1 has a high glass transition<br>
temperature (Tg), it has excellent thermal stability. For example, the glass transition<br>
temperature of the compound of Formula 3-2 is 150°C, which is still higher than that of<br>
conventionally used NPB (Tg: 96oc). Such increase in thermal stability is an important<br>
factor providing actuating stability to the device.<br>
[97]	Furthermore, the compound, of Formula 1 may be used to form the organic material<br>
layer using a vacuum deposition process or a solution coating process during the<br>
production of the organic light emitting device. In connection with this, illustrative, but<br>
non-limiting, examples of the solution coating process include a spin coating process, a<br>
dip coating process, an inkjet printing process, a screen printing process, a spray<br>
process, and a roll coating process.<br>
[98]	For example, the compound of Formula 2 has excellent solubility to a polar solvent,<br>
such as xylene, dichloroethane, or NMP, which is used during the production of the<br>
device, and forms a thin film very well through the process using a solution, thus the<br>
solution coating process may be applied to produce the device. Additionally, a light<br>
emitting wavelength of a thin film or a solid formed using the solution coating process<br>
is typically shifted to a longer wavelength due to interaction between molecules, in<br>
comparison with a light emitting wavelength in a solution state. Little shift in the<br>
wavelength occurs in the compound having the structure shown in Formula 1.<br>
[99]	Tertiary alcohol, which is produced by a reaction of a lithiated aryl and keto group,<br>
is heated in the presence of an acid catalyst to form a hexagonal cyclic structure while<br>
water is removed, thereby producing the compound having a spiro structure according<br>
to the present invention. The above-mentioned procedure for producing the compound<br>
is well known in the an, and those skilled in the art can change the production<br>
conditions during the production of the compound of Formula 1. The production will<br>
be described in detail in the preparation examples later.<br>
[100]	In the organic light emitting device of the present invention, a compound, in which<br>
a thermosetting or photo-crosslinkable functional group is introduced into the<br><br>
compound of Formula 1, for example the compound of Formula 12, may be used<br>
instead of the compound of Formula 1. The former compound has the basic physical<br>
properties of the compound of Formula I, and may be used to form a thin film using a<br>
solution coating process and then be cured so as to form an organic material layer<br>
during the production of the device.<br>
[101]	The method of forming the organic material layer, which comprises introducing the<br>
curable functional group into the organic material during the production of the organic<br>
light emitting device, forming the organic thin Film using the solution coating process,<br>
and curing the resulting film, is disclosed in US Pat. No. 2003-0044518 and EP Pat.<br>
No. 1146574 A2.<br>
[ 102]	The above documents state that, if the organic material layer is formed through the<br>
above-mentioned method using a material having a thermosetting or photo-<br>
crosslinkable vinyl or acryl group so as to produce an organic light emitting device, it<br>
is possible to produce an organic light emitting device having a low voltage and high<br>
brightness as well as an organic light emitting device having a multilayered structure<br>
using the solution coating process. This operation mechanism may be applied to the<br>
compound of the present invention.<br>
[103]	In the present invention, the thermosetting or photo-crosslinkable functional group<br>
may be a vinyl or an acryl group.<br>
[ 104]	The organic light emitting device of the present invention can be produced using<br>
known materials through a known process, modified only in that at least one layer of<br>
organic material layer(s) include the compound of the present invention, that is, the<br>
compound of Formula 1.<br>
[ 105]	The organic material layer(s) of the organic light emitting device according to the<br>
