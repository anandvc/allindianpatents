[0043] One embodiment is a method of synthesizing the compound of formula (T<br>
comprising reacting the compound of formula II ((4-fluorobenzyl)-(l-methylpiperidin-4<br>
yl)amine)<br><br><br>
WO 2006/037043	PC17US2005/03481<br>
with the compound of formula III(4-(2-methytoropyloxy phenyl lmethyl-isocyanate)<br><br>
[0044] In one embodiment, about 0.9 to about 1.1 equivalents of (4-fluorobenzyl)-<br>
(l-methylpiperidin-4-yl)amine per equivalent of 4-(2-methylpropyloxy)phenylmethyl-isocyanate<br>
is used. In some embodiments, the resulting compound of formula I is isolated from the reaction<br>
mixture. In one embodiment, a salt-forming acid is added after the reaction. The formed salt<br>
may be isolated by solvent removal, precipitation, or both solvent removal and precipitation,<br>
followed by deliberation of the compound of formula I under alkaline aqueous conditions through<br>
dissolution in an organic solvent in a two phase system, and separating the compound of formula<br>
I from the organic solution. In a preferred embodiment, 1.0 equivalent of (4-fluorobenzyl)-(l-<br>
methylpiperidin-4-yl)amine per equivalent of 4-(2-methylpropyloxy)phenylmethyl-isocyanate is<br>
used in the reaction. The reaction may be carried out in the presence of Lewis acids as catalysts<br>
such as metal salts or more preferably metal alkoxylates. Some examples are MgCl2, FeCl2,<br>
FeCl3, FeBr2) Fe(SO4)2, NiCl2, BC13, A1C13, BBr3, TiCl4, TiBr4, ZrCl4, BC13, Al(O-C,-C4-Alkyl)3,<br>
and Ti(O-C1-C4-Alkyl)3. The amount of catalyst may be from about 0.0001 to about 5 percent by<br>
weight and preferably about 0.01 to about 3 percent by weight relative to the compound of<br>
formula n.<br>
[0045] The reaction is preferably carried out in the presence of an inert organic<br>
solvent such as aliphatic ethers (e.g., diethyl ether, methyl propyl ether, dibutyl ether, ethylene<br>
glycol dimethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran or dioxane), esters of aliphatic carboxylic acids or alcohols<br>
(e.g., C1-C4, alkyl esters of acetic acid), lactones (e.g., valerolactorie), halogenated hydrocarbons<br>
(e.g., di- or trichloromethane, tetrachloroethane), or aliphatic C3-C8ketones (e.g., acetone, methyl<br>
propyl ketone, diethyl ketone, or methyl i- or t-butyl ketone).<br>
[0046] The reaction temperature is preferably in the range of about -30 °C to about<br>
60 °C and more preferably in the range of about 5 °C to about 30 °C. The reaction time may be<br>
controlled by monitoring the consumption of the compound of formula II or formula III either by<br>
on-line process analytics, or by recovering and analyzing samples off-line.<br>
[0047] Isolation of the compound of formula I may be performed by any suitable<br>
method including removal of the solvent by distillation of the reaction residue under reduced<br>
pressure and lower temperatures, such as up to about 100 °C, preferably up to about 80 DC.<br>
Isolation may also occur by partial removal of solvent to increase the concentration, filtering of<br>
impurities, precipitating the solid compound of formula I either by further concentration or<br>
11<br><br>
WO 2006/037043	PCT/US2005/034813<br>
addition of a non-solvent such as an aliphatic hydrocarbon (e.g., pentane, hexane, heptane,<br>
octane, cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane, or water), filtering of the solid, and drying. The<br>
isolated compound of formula I may be purified by known methods such as distillation or<br>
chromatographic methods.<br>
[0048] It was found that removal of impurities such as formed side-products prior to<br>
the isolation is a convenient route to produce the compound of formula I with high purity. It was<br>
further found that purification can be effectively improved by forming salts of the carbamide,<br>
which can be precipitated as crystalline compounds and re-crystallizcd from solvents to remove<br>
impurities. The free carbamide of formula I is then deliberated by dissolution of the salt in water,<br>
addition of a base, and extraction of the carbamide with an organic solvent. The organic solutions<br>
may be washed with water and aqueous sodium chloride before removal of the sol vent by<br>
distillation, optionally under reduced pressure. Impurities may be removed in this method by<br>
precipitation or dissolution in water in then use of a two phase systems. When precipitation of<br>
the salt is desired for easy isolation by filtration or centrifugation, partial removal of the organic<br>
solvent and addition of fresh solvent may be carried out. Suitable solvents with low salt<br>
solubility are aprotic organic solvents such as hydrocarbons, halogenated hydrocarbons, ethers,<br>
"ketones, carboxylic acid esters and lactones, acetonitrile, and alcohols having at least 3 carbon<br>
atoms.<br>
[0049] Salt forming acids may be selected from inorganic or organic acids, such as<br>
mineral acids (HCl, HBr, HI, H2SO4), mono- or dicarboxylic acids (formic acid, acetic acid,<br>
oxalic acid, malonic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, succinic acid, tartaric acid) or sulfooic acids<br>
(methylsulfonic acid). The acids may be added as aqueous solutions in amounts sufficient to form<br>
a solid or crystalline precipitate. The amount may range from about 0.5 to about 2 equivalents<br>
relative to the compound of formula I, depending mainly on the functionality of the acid and the<br>
desired excess for complete and fast salt formation.<br>
[0050] The salts may be dissolved in water and a non-water misciblc organic solvent<br>
for the compound of formula I added to dissolve the deliberated compound of formula I -when the<br>
base is added. Suitable bases include, but are not limited to, alkaline earth metal hydroxides such<br>
as LiOH, NaOH or KOH. In one embodiment, the pH of the aqueous phase is greater th_an about<br>
8.5. The reaction may be terminated from minutes to 1 hour. The reaction is preferably stopped<br>
after 5 to 30 minutes. The organic phase is then separated, optionally washed with water and<br>
brine and/or filtered. The desired product may be obtained by removal of the solvent and drying,<br>
or by precipitation with anon-solvent, filtration, and drying of the solid residue. The compound<br>
of formula I is obtained in high purity and yields.<br>
[0051] The starting materials for the above-described reaction can be obtained by<br>
known and analogous methods. Specifically, the compound of formula II may be obtained by the<br>
12<br><br>
WO 2006/037043	PCT/US2005/034813<br>
reaction of N-methylpiperidine-4-one with 4-fluorobenzylamine in the presence of a metal<br>
hydride, for example according to the scheme<br><br>
This oxime may be catalytically hydrogenated with a palladium catalyst to the corresponding 4-<br>
isobutoxybenzylamine, from which the isocyanate of formula HI may be obtained by reaction<br>
with phosgene.<br>
Crystalline form of N-r4-fluorobenzyl')-N-(l-methvlpipcri(lin-4-yl)-'-(4-(2-methvlpropyloxy)<br>
phenvlmethvDcarbamide (FormY)<br>
[0053] Using the above-described method, the compound of formula I is generally<br>
obtained as a substantially amorphous solid, which may be admixed with small amounts of a<br>
crystalline form. It was surprisingly found that a pure crystalline form can be obtained from the<br>
salt form, such as the hemi-tartrate salt, when deliberating the base under certain condition. This<br>
crystallisation can even be used to purify the base by re-crystallization of salts or by re-<br>
crystallization of the base itself.<br>
[0054] Accordingly, in one embodiment, a crystalline form of N-(4-fluorobenzyl)-N-<br>
(l-methylpiperidin-4-yl)-N'-(4-(2-methylpropyloxy)phenylmethyl)carbamide is provided that<br>
exhibits a characteristic melting point of about 124 °C (peak temperature), determined with<br>
Differential Scanning Calometry (DSC) at a heating rate of 10 °C/minute, hereinafter designated<br>
as form Y. The enthalpy of fusion of form Y is about 99 J/g.<br>
[0055] The X-ray powder diffraction pattern of form Y is depicted in Figure 1.<br>
Specifically the X-ray powder diffraction pattern exhibits the following characteristic peaks<br>
expressed in d-values (A): 13.0 (vs), 10.9 (vs), 6.8 (vw), 6.5 (s), 6.2 (w), 5.2 (w), 4.7 (m), 4.5 (w),<br>
4.3 (s), 4.22 (vs), 4.00 (m), 3.53 (vw), 3.40 (vw), 3.28 (w), 3.24 (w), 3.19 (w), 3.08 (w), 2.91 (w),<br>
and 2.72 (w).   The abbreviations in parenthesis are used herein as follows:   (vs) = very strong<br>
13<br><br>
WO 2006/037043	PCT/US2005/034813<br>
intensity, (s) = strong intensity, (m) = medium intensity, (w) = weak intensity, and (vw) - very<br>
weak intensity. In various embodiments, form Y is present in a solid form of the compound of<br>
formula I in amounts of at least about 50%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, or 98%, with the remainder<br>
being other crystalline forms (including hydrates and solvates) and/or amorphous forms.<br>
[0056] Form Y is a very therrnodynamically stable form of the compound of formula<br>
I. Powder X-ray diffraction and DSC indicate the crystalline character of form Y, and analysis of<br>
the elemental composition complies with compound of formula I. The crystalline form Y of<br>
formula I is obtained as a white powder.<br>
[0057] The compound of formula I is soluble in various organic solvents and shows<br>
a low solubility in water. In contrast, salts of the compound of formula I are well soluble in<br>
water. These properties can be used for the preparation of Form Y of the compound of formula I.<br>
For example, one process for forming Form Y includes:<br>
a)	dissolution in water under stirring of a salt form of formula I, preferably the hemi-tartrate<br>
salt;<br>
b)	addition of a sufficient amount of an organic aprotic solvent for the dissolution of the<br>
formed compound of formula I;<br>
c)	adjusting of the pH of the aqueous salt solution to a value of at least 8.5 by addition of a<br>
base;<br>
d)	optionally extracting the aqueous phase with the organic solvent and collecting all or-<br>
ganic phases;<br>
e)	removing a part of the solvent and cooling the remaining organic solution to less than 15<br>
°C;<br>
f)	holding at this temperature while optionally stirring; and<br>
g)	filtering off the precipitate, washing the solid residue, and drying it<br>
The mother liquor can be again concentrated and cooled to increase the yield. Salt forming acids<br>
may be selected from inorganic or organic acids, such as mineral acids (e.g., IIC1, HBr, HI,<br>
H2SO4) H3PO4), mono- or dicarboxylic acids (e.g., formic acid, acetic acid, oxalic acid, malonic<br>
acid, tartaric acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, succinic acid), sulfonic acids (e.g., methylsulfonic<br>
acid), citric acid, glucuronic acid, malic acid, pamoic acid, or ethane-1,2-disulfonic acid.<br>
[0058] Suitable solvents are hydrocarbons such as toluene, halogenated<br>
hydrocarbons such as di- or trichloromethane, tetrachloroethane, esters of aliphatic carboxylic<br>
acids and alcohols (C2-C4alkyl esters of acetic acid) (ethyl acetate), lactoncs (valerolactone),<br>
ethers (diethylether, methylpropyl ether, t-butyl-methyl-ether, dibutyl ether, dimethyl ether),<br>
aliphatic C4-C8ketones (methyl propyl ketone, diethyl ketonc or methyl i- or t-butyl ketone). The<br>
pH value in step c) may be advantageously adjusted to at least 9.5.  Suitable bases include, but<br>
14<br><br>
WO 2006/037043	PCT/US2005/034813<br>
are not limited to aqueous alkaline or earth alkaline metal hydroxides such as LiOH, NaOH,<br>
KOH or Ca(OH)2.<br>
[0059] Removal of a part of the solvent mainly serves to concentrate the organic<br>
solution so that it contains about 5 to about 30 percent by weight of the compound of formula I.<br>
The cooling temperature is preferably in the range of about -10 to about 10 °C and most<br>
preferably about 0 °C to about 10 °C. Storage time at this temperature optionally under stirring is<br>
preferably about 30 minutes to about 12 hours. Removal of residual solvent may be carried out in<br>
a conventional manner under vacuum, in an inert gas flow, or both.<br>
Formation        of       N-(4-fluorobenzvr)-N-( 1 -methvlpipcridin-4~yl)-N' -(4-(2-methvlpropyloxv)<br>
phenylmethylicarbamide hemi-tartrate<br>
[0060] The compound of formula I has a low solubility in water. Accordingly, in<br>
some embodiments, forms of the compound are provided that are water soluble and hence have<br>
enhanced bioavailability and improved processing characteristics for the preparation and<br>
formulation of drug compositions. It was found that a hemi-tartrate of N-(4-fiuorobenzyl)-N-(l-<br>
methylpiperidin-4-yl)-N'-(4-(2-methylpropyloxy)phenylmethyl)carbamide is particularly suitable.<br>
Accordingly, one embodiment provides N-(4-fluorobenzyI)-N-(l--methylpipcridin-4-yl)-N'-(4-(2-<br>
methylpropyloxy)phenylmethyl)carbamide hemi-tartrate according to the formula IV,<br><br>
[0061] The compound of formula IV may be prepared as an integrated part of the<br>
process for synthesizing the compound of formula I as described above by using tartaric acid as<br>
the salt forming acid. Alternatively, the tartrate salt may be formed by reaction of the isolated<br>
compound of formula I with tartaric acid.<br>
[0062] In one embodiment, N-(4-fluorobenzyl)-N-(l-methyIpiperidin-4-yl)-N'-(4-(2-<br>
methylpropyloxy)phenylmethyl)carbamide hemi-tartrate is formed according to the following<br>
method:<br>
a)   react about 0.9 to about 1.1 equivalents of (4-fluorobenzyl)-(l-methylpiperidin-4-<br>
yl)amine of formula II<br>
15<br><br><br>
b)	add tartaric acid, and<br>
c)	isolate the hemi-tartrate of the compound of formula I from the obtained suspension.<br>
The hemi-tartrate may also be obtained through precipitation by cooling, solvent removal, adding<br>
a non-solvent, or a combination of these methods. In one embodiment, one or more solvents are<br>
added in step b) that have a low solubility for the hemi-tartrate, such as isopropyl acetate, a<br>
ketone (such as acetone or 2-butanone), and/or tctrahydrofuran. The temperature in step b) is pre-<br>
ferably from about 15 to about 30 °C. The hemi-tartrate precipitates and forms a suspension,<br>
which may be stirred for up to 3 days before filtering off the solid from the reaction mixture<br>
preferably at ambient conditions.  The solid residue may be washed,   and then dried  at<br>
temperatures up to 50 °C, if desired, under vacuum.<br>
[0063] The hemi-tartrate of formula IV is obtained in high yields and purity. The<br>
mother liquors can be used to isolate more hemi-tartrate of formula IV in the usual manner. The<br>
hemi-tartrate may be further purified by conversion to the free base of formula I and isolating a<br>
solution of the base, which is then used to re-precipitate the hemi-tartrate by the addition of<br>
tartaric acid.<br>
Crystalline forms of N-(4-fluorobenzvl)-N-d-methvlpiperidin-4-yl')-N'-(4-r2-<br>
methvlpropvloxviphenylmethyncarbamide hemi-tartrate fForms A-C)<br>
[0064] It was surprisingly found that the compound of formula IV can be obtained in<br>
a number of crystalline forms. One such crystalline solid form produced by the above-described<br>
method is hereinafter referred to crystalline form A. Crystalline form A generally contains some<br>
water as demonstrated when subjected to heat in thermogravimetric analysis coupled to FT<br>
infrared spectroscopy, or by Karl Fischer titration. The water content may range up to an amount<br>
of about 2 to 3 percent by weight, which would generally correspond to a hemi-hydrate.<br>
However, the water is only weakly bound, since the weight loss starts just above ambient<br>
temperature and is complete at about 150 °C. The water can also easily be removed by treatment<br>
with dry nitrogen for a longer time (about up to 20 hours) and form A can also exist in a water-<br>
free state.  DSC indicates that the melting point of the dehydrated form A is about 133-135 °C<br><br>
16<br><br>
WO 2006/037043	PCT/US2005/034813<br>
(peak temperature) with an enthalpy of fusion of about 70 J/g. Form A shows a considerable<br>
water uptake when exposed to humidity, especially above 75% relative humidity. The water is<br>
given off when the relative humidity is decreased to 50% and less. This behaviour is typical for a<br>
deliquescent solid. The compound of formula IV as crystalline form A is well soluble in me-<br>
thanol, water, or organic solvents admixed with water. The compound of formula IV shows a low<br>
solubility in other organic solvents. Crystalline form A may contain smaller amounts of<br>
crystalline form C (described below), when manufactured according to the above process.<br>
[0065] The X-ray powder diffraction pattern of form A is depicted in Figure 2.<br>
Specifically the X-ray powder diffraction pattern exhibits the following characteristic peaks<br>
expressed in d-values (A): 18.6 (s), 16.7 (vs), 10.2 (s), 8.2 (m), 7.7 (w), 7.4 (w), 6.5 (w), 6.2 (m),<br>
6.1 (vs), 5.86 (w), 5.14 (m), 5.03 (m), 4.78 (m), 4.69 (m), 4.63 (s), 4.49 (s), 4.44 (vs), 4.35 (m),<br>
4.10 (m), 3.96 (s), and 3.66 (m). In various embodiments, form A is present in a solid form of the<br>
compound of formula IV in amounts of at least about 50%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, or 98%, with<br>
the remainder being other crystalline forms (including hydrates and solvatcs) and/or amorphous<br>
forms.<br>
[0066] Crystalline form A can be prepared in a controlled manner by crystallization<br>
from ethanol, optionally admixed with isopropanol. Accordingly, one embodiment is a process<br>
for the preparation of crystalline form A that includes:<br>
a)	dissolving the compound of formula IV in ethanol or an admixture of ethanol and iso-<br>
propanol at elevated temperature;<br>
b)	slowly cooling the solution to a temperature of less than 20 °C; and<br>
c)	filtering off the precipitated solid and drying it.<br>
[0067] In some embodiments, the mixtures of ethanol and isopropanol may contain<br>
up to about 15 and more preferably up to 10 volume percent isopropanol. Ethanol is the<br>
preferred solvent. It is also preferred to use dried ethanol, optionally in admixture with dry<br>
isopropanol. In some embodiments, the elevated temperature is from about 55 to about 90 °C and<br>
preferably from about 55 to about 65 °C. The mixture is stirred at elevated temperatures until the<br>
compound of formula IV is completely dissolved. Slow cooling may mean a cooling rate of<br>
about 0.1 to about 3 °C/minute, preferably about 0.2 to about 2 °C/minute, and particularly about<br>
0.2 to about 1 °C/rninute. Crystallization started at below about 50 °C and it was observed that a<br>
thick paste can form when stirring at such a temperature for about 1 hour. Heating again to the<br>
higher temperature and then cooling again generally results in a suspension, which can be stirred<br>
at about 40 to about 50 °C and also when further cooling to a temperature of less than about 20<br>
°C, preferably about 5 to about 15 °C. The cooling rate after stirring may be about 0.1 to about 3<br>
°C/minute and preferably about 0.3 to about 1 °C/minute. The resulting crystalline solid is then<br>
filtered off and dried by sucking dry air through the filter cake at temperatures of about 25 to less<br>
17<br><br>
WO 2006/037043	PCT/US2005/034813<br>
than about 40 °C, preferably at about 30 °C. Drying may be completed by keeping the pre-dned<br>
solid for a certain time under vacuum at ambient or elevated temperature.<br>
[0068] The compound of formula IV can be transformed to a completely amorphous<br>
form by dissolving the compound in a solvent such as for example water and lyophilizing the<br>
solution. The amorphous form can then be used to manufacture other polymorphic or pseudo-<br>
polymorphic forms.<br>
[0069] In one embodiment, another crystalline form of the compound of formula IV<br>
is prepared using phase equilibration processes in a reproducible manner using ethyl acetate,<br>
acetone, methyl-ethyl ketone, or acetonitrile as solvent. This crystalline solid is hereinafter<br>
referred to crystalline form B. Crystalline form B may contain some water, as demonstrated when<br>
subjected to heat in thermogravimetric analysis coupled to FT infrared spectroscopy, or by Karl<br>
Fischer titration. The water content may range up to an amount of about 3.4 percent by weight.<br>
This amount generally indicates a monohydrate stable under ambient conditions (theoretical<br>
content would be 3.5 %). However, water is only weakly bound, since a weight loss is observed<br>
at ambient temperature and low relative humidity of about less than 20% and form B can also<br>
exist in a water-free state. The melting point of the dehydrated form B is about 135 °C with an<br>
enthalpy of fusion of about 71 J/g. Form B shows a considerable water uptake when exposed to<br>
high humidity, especially above 80% relative humidity. However, the hygroscopicity is less<br>
pronounced than observed in form A and no deliquescence is found at high relative humidity of<br>
about 90%.<br>
[0070] The X-ray powder diffraction pattern of form B is depicted in Figure 3.<br>
Specifically the X-ray powder diffraction pattern exhibits the following characteristic peaks<br>
expressed in d-values (A): 7.4 (vs), 10.2 (s), 8.8 (w), 6.4 (w), 5.91 (vs), 5.46 (w), 4.99 (rn), 4.90<br>
(m), 4.62 (m), 4.50 (vs), 4.37 (vs), 4.20 (w), 3.87 (vs), 3.73 (w), 3.58 (m), 3.42 (w), and 2.90 (w).<br>
In various embodiments, form B is present in a solid form of the compound of formula IV in<br>
amounts of at least about 50%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, or 98%, with the remainder being other<br>
crystalline forms (including hydrates and solvates) and/or amorphous forms.<br>
[0071] Crystalline form B can be prepared in a controlled manner by various<br>
processes. In one embodiment, it is precipitated from solutions in polar solvents such as water or<br>
methylene chloride using non-solvents such as methylethylketone, heptane, toluene, acetonitrile<br>
or ethyl acetate at temperatures of 0-40 °C, and subsequent phase equilibration substantially at<br>
room temperature. Another method is the equilibration of suspensions of other crystalline forms<br>
such as crystalline forms A or C or mixtures thereof in solvents such as acetonitrile, ethyl acetate,<br>
ethanol/methylethylketone, ethanol/acetone, ethyl acetate saturated with water, acetonitrile or<br>
ethyl acetate containing about 1 volume percent of water at a temperature from room temperature<br>
to about 40 °C, optionally with temperature cycles. The equilibration of suspensions with the<br>
18<br><br>
WO 2006/037043	PCT/US2005/034813<br>
amorphous material of the compound of formula I at temperatures of 0 to about 45 °C, optionally<br>
under the application of temperature cycles, is a further method for the preparation of form B.<br>
Suitable solvents are heptane, ethyl acetate, acetonitrile, methylethylketone, ethylacetate or<br>
tertiary-butylmethylether saturated with water, or ethyl acetate/ethanol containing 1 volume<br>
percent water.<br>
[0072] It was observed that crystal form A from the hemi-tartratc production can<br>
contain to some extent another polymorph form and further investigation revealed that this<br>
polymorph is neither a hydrate nor a solvate. This crystalline solid is hereinafter referred to as<br>
crystalline form C. Crystalline form C may be prepared by suspension equilibration of crystalline<br>
forms A or B, preferably with addition of seeding crystals of form C. Crystalline form C is more<br>
thermodynamically and chemically stable than forms A or B. Crystalline form C absorbs much<br>
less water than form A. Water absorption at about 95% relative humidity is only about 1% and no<br>
deliquescence or hygroscopicity is observed. The exposure to humidity does not result in a<br>
change of the crystalline form. Crystalline form C is stable at 75% relative humidity in an open<br>
container and does not absorb water up to about 60 °C. Thermogravimetric analysis results in a<br>
weight loss of about O.9% below 150 °C, which can be attributed to absorbed water. The<br>
investigation with DSC at a heating rate of 20 °C shows an endothermic signal at 177 °C with an<br>
enthalpy of fusion of about 129 J/g. The signal is attributed to the melting (peak) temperature,<br>
whereby first decomposition of the substance is observed above 170 °C. Solubility of crystalline<br>
form C in water is very high. Crystalline form C is highly suitable as an active compound in the<br>
manufacturing and formulation of drugs.<br>
[0073] The X-ray powder diffraction pattern of form C is depicted in Figure 4.<br>
Specifically the X-ray powder diffraction pattern exhibits the following characteristic peaks<br>
expressed in d-values (A): 12.0 (w), 10.7 (vs), 7.4 (vw), 6.9 (vw), 6.6 (vw), 6.2 (w), 5.86 (m),<br>
5.53 (w), 5.28 (m), 5.16 (m), 4.84 (vs), 4.70 (m), 4.57 (s), 4.38 (m), 4.09 (w), 3.94 (w), 3.77 (s),<br>
3.71 (m),3.49 (w), 3.46 (w), 3.25 (w), 3.08 (w), and 2.93 (w). In various embodiments, form C is<br>
present in a solid form of the compound of formula IV in amounts of at least about 50%, 70%,<br>
80%, 90%, 95%, or 98%, with the remainder being other crystalline forms (including hydrates<br>
and solvates) and/or amorphous forms.<br>
[0074] In one embodiment, a process is provided for the preparation of pure<br>
crystalline form C on a large scale for industrial production of the pharmaceutically active<br>
compound. It was found that the crystallization from heated and then cooled solutions does not<br>
readily result in form C. It was further found that form C can be manufactured in a controlled<br>
manner, when crystalline forms A or B are equilibrated in suspension in the presence of a polar<br>
and aprotic solvent and seed crystals of form C are added. In an alternative to using seed<br>
crystals, a starting material may be used that contains some crystal form C after preparation of the<br>
19<br><br>
WO 2006/037043	PCT/US2005/034813<br>
compound of formula IV. The solid in the suspension may have crystals with a particle size in<br>
the range of 1 to about 200 and preferably 2 to 100 am, which can be filtered off, washed and<br>
dried under moderate conditions; e.g., for instance at 60°C under vacuum. The particle size<br>
obtained may be dependent on the manufacture scale, on the solvent or solvent mixture used, on<br>
the cooling rate, and the number of added seeding crystals.<br>
[0075] One method for the preparation of crystalline form C comprises forming a<br>
suspension of a solid compound of formula IV in an aprotic solvent at elevated temperature and<br>
stirring the suspension, optionally adding crystal seeds of form C, until substantial complete<br>
conversion in pure form C.<br>
[0076] The temperature of the process may be from 20 to 100 °C and preferably 40<br>
to 80 °C. Suitable solvents for conversion to form C may be selected from the group comprising<br>
aliphatic or cyclic ethers, carboxylic esters, lactones, alkanes and aliphatic C3-C8ketones. Seeding<br>
with crystals of form C is preferably carried out when the solid form is in part dissolved and a<br>
saturated solution is formed in which the solid form is suspended. Seeding is carried out prefe-<br>
rably in a temperature range from 40 to 80 °C and more preferably from 55 to 65 °C. Stirring<br>
time of the suspension may be from 30 minutes to days, and most preferably from 30 minutes to 6<br>
hours. The suspension is slowly cooled before isolation of the solid by filtration or centrifugation<br>
and the cooling rate may be from 0.1 to 1 °C/minute. Cooling may be carried out to an end<br>
temperature near room temperature or below.<br>
[0077]        One embodiment is a process for the preparation of crystalline form C of N-<br>
(4-fluorobenzyl)-N-(l-methylpiperidin-4-yl)-N'-(4-(2-methylpropyloxy)phenylmethyl)carbamide<br>
tartrate of formula IV, comprising:<br>
a)	suspending the amorphous form or crystalline forms A, B, D, E, or F or mixtures thereof<br>
under stirring in a polar and aprotic solvent at temperatures from 30 to 70 °C;<br>
b)	continuing stirring at temperatures from 30 to 70 °C and adding crystal seeds of<br>
crystalline form C, when crystalline form C is not present in the starting material;<br>
c)	continuing stirring at temperatures from 30 to 70 °C until formation of crystalline form C<br>
is completed;<br>
d)	cooling to the process end temperature;<br>
e)	isolating of the crystalline solid from the suspension; and<br>
f)	optionally washing and then drying the crystalline solid.<br>
[0078] Crystalline form A may be used as the starting material, but the process can<br>
also be carried out with forms B, D, E, and F, or with an amorphous form. The starting material<br>
may advantageously be dried prior to use. Drying at 40°C under vacuum is generally sufficient to<br>
remove unwanted residual solvents (e.g., alcohols, water, or mixtures thereof) which are<br>
detrimental to the formation of form. C.  Suitable solvents for crystallization of form C may be<br>
20<br><br>
WO 2006/037043	PCT/US2005/034813<br>
selected from the group comprising ethers, carboxylic esters, lactoncs and aliphatic ketones.<br>
Some specific examples and preferred solvents are diethylet'her, propyl methyl ether, t-butyl<br>
methyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, ethyl acetate, t-butyl methyl ketone, acetone, and methyl ethyl<br>
ketone. Most preferred solvent are ketones and especially pre ferred is methyl ethyl ketone and<br>
tetrahydrofuran. The amounts of crystalline forms A or B in the suspension, when used as starting<br>
materials, are not critical and the amount is chosen such that the suspension can be stirred at the<br>
applied temperatures. The temperature in step a) is preferably at about room temperature.<br>
[0079] The temperature in steps b) and c) may range from 10 to 60 °C. It may be<br>
advantageous to apply temperature cycles between higher and lower temperatures. The amount of<br>
crystal seeds added may be from 0.01 to 10 and preferably 0.1 to 5 percent by weight, referred to<br>
the amount of crystalline forms A and/or B. The addition of crystal seeds is in general preferred<br>
in order to accelerate the transformation of the crystalline forms.<br>
[0080] Stirring in step c) may be continued for hours to days, for example, 0.5 hours<br>
to 3 days and preferably 2 hours to about 2 days. The transformation/conversion time<br>
substantially depends on the scale, the temperature, the solvent used, agitating intensity, and the<br>
amount of crystal seeds added to the suspension. The conversion time may be controlled by<br>
monitoring the ratio of the disappearing form and the produced form C either by on-line process<br>
analytics, or by recovering and analyzing samples off-line.<br>
[0081] Isolation of the crystalline solid can be carried out by centrifugation or<br>
filtration. The product may be washed for example with a solvent and then dried over dry inert<br>
gas which can be pulled through the filter cake optionally under vacuum or applying vacuum for<br>
a time sufficient to remove the solvents. Further drying, either under vacuum and/or at moderate<br>
temperatures up to about 80°C can be applied. It can be noted that form C exhibits excellent<br>
properties in terms of filtration and drying and a solid material is obtained that is essentially free<br>
of residual solvent; i.e., with less than 1000 ppm, preferably less than 200 ppm.<br>
[0082] It was surprisingly found that crystalline form C can also be prepared by<br>
crystallization from a solution of the compound of formula IV in a selected solvent and seeding<br>
with crystalline form C at elevated temperature. Accordingly, in one embodiment, a method of<br>
preparing crystalline form C is provided, comprising:<br>
a)	dissolving the amorphous form or crystalline forms A, B, D, E or F or mixtures thereof<br>
under stirring in a suitable solvent at temperatures from 0 to 70 ºC;<br>
b)	continuing stirring and adding crystal seeds of crystalline form C to the solution at elevated<br>
temperature; preferably at about 50 to 70 °C and most preferably at 55 to 65 °C;<br>
c)	continuing agitation of the forming suspension at the same temperature for a time<br>
sufficient to convert the compound of formula IV in crystalline form C;<br>
21<br><br>
WO 2006/037043	PCT/US2005/034813<br>
d)	cooling the obtained suspension at a cooling rate of 5 to 15 °C per hour to -20 °C to room<br>
temperature and preferably to 0 to 25 °C;<br>
e)	isolating the crystalline solid from the suspension; and<br>
f)	optionally washing and then drying the crystalline solid.<br>
[0083] The amount of the compound of formula IV in step a) is chosen such that<br>
concentrated solutions are obtained. The concentration that can be reached depends on the<br>
solvent or solvent mixture used, and the solubility of the starting material. Tetrahydrofuran, and<br>
mixtures containing tetrahydrofuran are preferred as solvents since typically about 200 mg/ml of<br>
form A can be dissolved at reflux temperature. However, any solvent suitable at dissolving the<br>
starting material may be used. Non-limiting examples include tetrahydrofuran, acetone, ethanol,<br>
isopropanol, dichloromethane, 1,4-dioxane, and acctonitrile. The temperature in step a) is<br>
preferably from 40 to 70 °C. The amount of added crystal seeds in step b) may be from 0.1 to<br>
15% by weight and preferably from 2 to 10% by weight, referred to the amount of dissolved<br>
compound of formula IV. The agitation time in step c) depends on the scale and may range from<br>
about 20 minutes to about 24 hours, more preferably from 25 minutes to 12 hours, and most<br>
preferably from 30 minutes to 6 hours. The cooling rate in step d) is preferably from 8 to 12 °C<br>
per hour. Stirring may be continued after cooling at the cooling temperature range for up to 24,<br>
preferably 18 hours and more preferably 14 hours.<br>
[0084] Crystalline form C can be obtained in high polymorphic purity. The material<br>
obtained with the processes described above may contain residual starting material, for example<br>
in amounts of up to 20 or up to 10 percent by weight relative to crystalline form C. These<br>
mixtures are also very suitable for drug formulations.<br>
Solvates of N-(4-fluorobenzvl')-N-(l-methylpiperidin-4-yl)-N'-(4-(7.-methylpropyloxv')<br>
phenylmethvDcarbamide hemi-tartrate (Forms D-F)<br>
[0085] In some embodiments, the compound of formula IV may form various<br>
solvates with certain solvents. These pseudo-polymorphic forms may be used in drug<br>
formulations or for the production of other polymorphic forms, hi some embodiments, these<br>
solvates can exist either as solvated forms; i.e., containing a significant amoxint of the respective<br>
solvent, or in a corresponding non-solvated from; i.e., in a solvent-free form, wherein the<br>
crystalline structure is essentially retained.<br>
[0086] One such solvate is formed by suspension equilibration of crystalline form A<br>
or an amorphous form of the compound of formula IV in isopropanol. After drying under<br>
nitrogen for about 30 minutes, the formed solvate contains about 6.0 to 6.6 percent by weight of<br>
isopropanol. The theoretical value for the hcmi-isopropanolate is 5.6% content of isopropanol<br>
and it is concluded that the hemi-solvate has formed.   The hemi-solvate with iso-propanol is<br>
22<br><br>
WO 2006/037043	PCT/US2005/034813<br>
stable when exposed to 53% relative humidity in an open container. This form is herein referred<br>
to as crystalline form D.<br>
[0087] The X-ray powder diffraction pattern of form D is depicted in Figure 5.<br>
Specifically the X-ray powder diffraction pattern exhibits the following characteristic peaks<br>
expressed in d-values (A): 17.2 (s), 16.0 (m), 10.7 (vw), 9.8 (w), 6.6 (m), 6.1 (s), 6.00 (m), 5.73<br>
(w), 5.33 (w), 5.17 (m), 4.91 (m), 4.64 (s), 4.54 (vs), 4.37 (vs), 4.10 (in), 3.91 (m), 3.84 (m), 3.67,<br>
(w), 3.55 (m), 3.42 (m), 3.32 (w), 3.13 (w), and 3.06 (m). In various embodiments, form D is<br>
present in a solid form of the compound of formula IV in amounts of at least about 50%, 70%,<br>
80%, 90%, 95%, or 98%, with the remainder being other crystalline forms (including hydrates<br>
and solvates) and/or amorphous forms.<br>
[0088] It was further found that a t-butyl methyl ether (TBME) solvate may be<br>
formed, when the amorphous form of the compound of formula IV is subjected to phase<br>
equilibration in TBME at ambient temperature. The content of TBME is about 5% by weight<br>
relative to the compound of formula IV, measured by thermogravimetry at 10 °C heating rate.<br>
This form is herein referred to as crystalline form E.<br>
[0089] The X-ray powder diffraction pattern of form E is depicted in Figure 6.<br>

expressed in d-values (A): 17.3 (vs), 16.2 (m), 10.6 (m), 9.8 (m), 8.1 (w), 7.5 (w), 6.6 (m), 6.0<br>
(vs), 5.28 (m), 5.09 (s), 4.90 (m), 4.72 (vs), 4.51 (m), 4.39 (s), 4.26 (s), 4.04 (m), 3.86 (w), 3.70<br>
(w), 3.54 (m), 3.48 (m), 3.02 (w). In various embodiments, form E is present in a solid form of<br>
the compound of formula IV in amounts of at least about 50%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, or 98%,<br>
with the remainder being other crystalline forms (including hydrates and solvates) and/or<br>
amorphous forms.<br>
[0090] It was also found that the crystallisation of the compound of formula IV from<br>
a solution in tetrahydrofaran (THF) results in a non-stoichiometrical THF solvate, which contains<br>
from 0 to about 3% THF relative to the compound of formula IV, as measured by<br>
thermogravimetry at a heating rate of 10 °C. The solvent release starts above ambient temperature<br>
and is complete near 130 °C. This form is herein referred to as crystalline form F.<br>
[0091] The X-ray powder diffraction pattern of form F is depicted in Figure 7.<br>
Specifically the X-ray powder diffraction pattern exhibits the following characteristic peaks<br>
expressed in d-values (A): 19.0 (w), 16.0 (m), 13.0 (m), 7.8 (w), 6.4 (m), 6.2 (m), 5.74 (w), 5.29<br>
(w), 5.04 (m), 4.83 (m), 4.62 (m), 4.50 (m), 4.34 (m), 4.24 (vs), 4.05 (m), 3.89 (in), 3.76 (m), 3.58<br>
(w), and 3.27 (m). In various embodiments, form F is present in a solid form of the compound of<br>
formula IV in amounts of at least about 50%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, or 98%, with the remainder<br>
being other crystalline forms (including hydrates and solvates) and/or amorphous forms.<br>

Stability and Pharmaceutical Formulations<br>
[0092] As mentioned above, the compound of formula IV is especially suitable as an<br>
active compound or pro-drug in pharmaceutical formulations to inhibit an activity of a<br>
monoamine receptor, preferably a serotonin receptor of the 5-HT2A subclass. The compound of<br>
formula IV has very good solubility in aqueous systems and the free base is deliberated at<br>
physiological pH ranges, providing a high bioavailability. The compound of formula IV also<br>
possesses high storage stability.<br>
[0093] It was found that crystal form C is the most stable form of all found crystal<br>
forms. It was also found that crystal forms A and B are stable at ambient temperatures, stable in<br>
the presence of form C, and capable of coexisting with crystal form C. Crystal forms A, B and<br>
especially C are suitable for various types and a broad range of formulations, even in presence of<br>
humid components. These new crystal forms A, B and especially C present some advantages for<br>
manufacture, good handling due to convenient crystal size and morphology, very good stability<br>
underproduction conditions of various types of formulation, storage stability, high solubility, and<br>
high bio-availability. Crystal forms D, E and F may also be used for pharmaceutical<br>
formulations.<br>
[0094] Form C is chemically very stable and can easily be formulated into tablets or<br>
any other pharmaceutically acceptable dosage form. Despite its high thermal stability it still<br>
exhibits favourable solubility properties as its aqueous solubility is greater than about 50 to 100<br>
mg/ml. Forms A, B, D, E, and F exhibit high aqueous solubility of greater than 200 mg/ml. The<br>
solubility of all forms will depend on the pH in aqueous environments.<br>
[0095] Forms A and B exhibit sufficient stability under ambient water partial<br>
pressures (i.e. at relative humidities between 20% and 75%). Furthermore, forms A and B are<br>
very suitable for pharmaceutical processing in aqueous environments; for instance, for<br>
granulation with water or with solvent-water mixtures.<br>
[0096] Accordingly, some embodiments include pharmaceutical compositions<br>

applications such as infusion or injection.<br>
[0098] The crystal forms described above may be directly used as powder (e.g.,<br>

other pharmaceutically acceptable ingredients in admixing the components and optionally finely<br>
divide them, and then filling capsules, composed for example from hard or soft gelatine,<br>
compressing tablets, pills or troches, or suspending or dissolving them in carriers for suspensions,<br>
elixirs and syrups. Coatings may be applied after compression to form pills.<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
Experimental Procedures<br>
[0126] Powder X-ray Diffraction (PXRD): PXRD was performed on a Philips 1710<br>
powder X-ray diffractometer using CuKα radiation, d-spacings were calculated from the 28<br>
values using the wavelength of 1.54060 A. Generally, 20 values were within an error of±0.1-<br>
0.2°. The experimental error on the d-spacing values was therefore dependent on the peak<br>
location.<br>
[0127] Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC): Perlan Elmer DSC 7 in gold<br>
sample pan sealed under nitrogen for characterization of form A and scaled under about 50% re-<br>

was stirred for 15 min and filtered. The line was washed with tetrahydrofuran (7 L) and the<br>
solvent was removed by distillation under reduced pressure at 20-25 °C to a residual volume of<br>
30 L. Isopropyl acetate (96 L) was added to obtain a solution of the title compound of formula I,<br>
which contains a small amount of impurities (mainly side products from the previous reactions.) Re-<br>
moval of the solvent from a sample yields a substantially amorphous solid.<br>

Example 3: Preparation of the hemi-tartrate of formula IV from the solution obtained, in<br>
Example 1(f)<br>
a)	Crude product salt formation<br>
[0141] To the solution of the compound of Formula I in isopropyl acetate (96 L)<br>
according to Example 1(f) was added at 23 °C a previously prepared solution of tartaric acid<br>
(1.7 kg) in water (1.7 L) and tetrahydrofuran (23 L). The residual suspension was stirred Tor 2.5<br>
days at 22 °C. The tartrate crude product was centrifuged and the cake was washed with 4<br>
portions of isopropyl acetate (4 x 23 L). A total of 107 kg of mother liquors was saved for<br>
later use in obtaining the tartrate salt. The wet cake was dried at about 40 °C to yield 8.3 kg (50%)<br>
product.<br>
b)	Purification<br>
[0142] The tartrate crude product of previous step a) (8.1 kg) was dissolved in<br>
demineralized water (41 L) at 22 °C. Isopropyl acetate (40 I.), 30% aqueous sodium hydroxide<br>
(4.3 kg) and sodium chloride (2 kg) were added. The pH was checked (&gt;12) and the solution was<br>
stirred for 15 min. The solution was decanted over 15 min and the aqueous phase was separated.<br>
The aqueous phase was re-extracted with isopropyl acetate (12 L). Demineralized water (20 X) and<br>
sodium chloride (2.0 kg) were added to the combined organic phases, the solution was stirred for<br>
15 min, decanted over 15 min and the aqueous phase was discarded. Charcoal (0.4 kg) was added<br>
and the mixture was stirred for 20 min and filtered. After a line wash with isopropyl acetate (12<br>
L), the solvent was removed under reduced pressure at 20-25 °C. Heptane (49 L) was added and<br>
the suspension was stirred for 15 min at 40 °C. Then, 8 L of solvent was removed by distillation<br>
under reduced pressure at 38-41 °C. The slurry was cooled to 20 °C and stirred for 1 h. The pToduct<br>
was centrifuged and the cake was washed with heptane (5 L). The wet compound of Formula I<br>
(5.5 .kg) was dissolved in ethanol (28 L) at 45 °C. A solution of tartaric acid (0.72 kg) in cthanol (11<br>
L) was added at 45 °C and the line was washed with ethanol (9 L). The solution was cooled to 43<br>
°C, seeded with the tartrate salt of the compound of Formula I, then the slurry was cooled to<br>
35 °C in 30 min, stirred at this temperature for 1 h and cooled to -5 °C. After 14 h at this<br>
temperature the product was centrifuged and washed with two portions of ethanol (2x6&gt; L). A<br>
total of 42 kg of mother liquors were saved for later use in obtaining the tartrate salt. The wet<br>
cake was dried at about 45 °C for 76 h to yield 4 kg.<br>
c)	Additional isolation from mother liquors<br>
[0143] Additional product was obtained from the saved mother liquors as follows.<br>
The solvent was removed by distillation under reduced pressure at 24-26 °C from a solution of<br>
the crude tartrate mother liquors (107 kg) from step a) and the Formula I-tartrate another<br>
33<br><br>
WO 2006/037043	PCT/US2005/034813<br>
liquors (42 kg) from step b) to a residual volume of 27 I,. Demineralized water (25 L) was added<br>
and the mixture was concentrated to a residual volume of 32 L by distillation under reduced<br>
pressure at 24-26 °C. Isopropyl acetate (30 L) and 30% aqueous sodium hydroxide (2.7 kg)<br>
were added. The pH was checked (&gt;12) and the solution was stirred for 15 min. The solution was<br>
decanted over 15 min and the aqueous phase was separated. The aqueous phase was re-<br>
extracted with isopropyl acetate (6 L). Demineralized water (9 L) and sodium chloride (0.9 kg)<br>
were added to the combined organic phases, the solution was stirred for 15 min, decanted over 15<br>
min and the aqueous phase was discarded. Charcoal (0.3 kg) was added, the mixture was stirred<br>
for 20 min and filtered. After a line wash with isopropyl acetate (8 L), the solvent was removed<br>
by distillation under reduced pressure at 20-25 °C to a residual volume of 12 L, but not to<br>
dryness. Heptane (25 L) was added at 30 °C, the slurry was cooled to 20 °C and stirred for 1.5 h.<br>
The product was centrifuged and the cake was washed with heptane (2x5 L). The wet cake (4.3<br>
kg) was dissolved in ethanol (23 L) at 45 °C. A solution of tartaric acid (0.58 kg) in ethanol (7.5<br>
L) was added at 45 °C and the line was washed with ethanol (6 L). The solution was stirred for<br>
20 min (crystallization of the product) and the slurry was cooled to 35 °C in 30 min, stirred at this<br>
temperature for 1 h and cooled to -5 °C. After 14 h at this temperature the product was<br>
centrifuged and washed with two portions of ethanol (2x4 L). The wet cake was dried at about<br>
45 °C for 80 h giving 3.3 kg of product.<br>
[0144] PXRD of both products revealed a crystalline sample and the high baseline<br>
indicated the presence of amorphous parts and possibly of small amounts of crystalline form C.<br>
PXRD reveals that the solid product contains substantially crystalline form A of N-(4-<br>
fluorobenzyl)-N-(1-methylpiperidin-4-yl)-N'-(4-(2-methylpropyloxy)phenylmethyl) carbamide<br>
hemi-tartrate of formula IV. Crystalline form A contains some water as demonstrated when<br>
subjected to heat in thermogravimetric analysis (TG-FTIR, loss of 2.2% attributed to water and a<br>
small amount of solvent). The amount indicates that crystalline form A was a hcrni-hydrate<br>
(theoretical value of water content 1.8%). However, water was only weakly bound, since the<br>
weight loss starts just above ambient temperature and was complete at about 150 °C. The water<br>
can also easily be removed by treatment with dry nitrogen for a longer time (about up to 20<br>
hours). The melting point of the dehydrated form A was about 133-135 °C with an enthalpy of<br>
fusion of about 70 J/g (peak temperature, measured by DSC). Form A shows a considerable water<br>
uptake when exposed to humidity above 75% relative humidity. The water was given off when<br>
the relative humidity was decreased to 50% and less. This behaviour was typical for a<br>
deliquescent solid.<br>
[0145] Approximate solubility was measured by preparation of saturated solutions<br>
in various solvents and gravimetric determination of dissolved substance after solvent removal.<br>
The results are given in Table 3.<br>

Example 4: Preparation of the hemi-tartrate of fomula IV from crude free base of formula I<br>
[0146] Crude product from Example 1(f) (5.5 kg) was dissolved at 45 °C in ethanol<br>
(28 L). A solution of (+)-L-tartaric acid (0.72 kg) in ethanol was added at 45 °C and the line was<br>
washed with 9 L of ethanol. The solution was cooled to 43 °C and seeded with the hemi-tartrate<br>
of formula IV. The slurry was then cooled to 35 °C over 30 min, stirred at this temperature for 1<br>
hour and cooled under stirring to -5 °C. After 14 hours stirring at this temperature, the product<br>
was centrifuged and washed with 2 portions of ethanol (2 x 6 L). The wet cake was dried at 45 °C<br>
for 76 hours yielding 4.0 kg of product (83%, based on tartaric acid). PXRD of the product re-<br>
vealed that polymorph A was formed.<br>
Example 5: Preparation of the hemi-tartrate of fomiula IV from crude free base of formula I<br>
[0147] Crude product according to Example 1(f) (4.3 kg) was dissolved at 45 °C in<br>
ethanol (23 L). A solution of (+)-L-tartaric acid (0.58 kg) in ethanol was added at 45 °C and the<br>
line was washed with 6 L of ethanol. The solution was stirred for 20 min (formation of solid<br>
precipitate) and the slurry was cooled to 35 °C over 30 min. The slurry was stirred at this<br>
temperature for 1 hour and then cooled to -5 °C. After 14 hours stirring at this temperature, the<br>
product was centrifuged and washed with 2 portions of ethanol (2x4 L). The wet cake was dried<br><br>
35<br><br>
WO 2006/037043	PCT/US2005/034813<br>
at 45 °C for 80 hours yielding 3.3 kg of product (85%, based on tartaric acid). PXRD of the<br>
product revealed that polymorph A was formed.<br>
Example 6: Preparation of amorphous form of compound of formula IV through lvophilization of"<br>
aqueous solution<br>
[0148] 2.02 g of crude free base of formula I was dissolved at room temperature in<br>
8.0 ml water (Fluka no. 95306) at 23+2 °C. The obtained solution was filtered through a 0.22 urn<br>
millipore filtration unit, and the filtered solution was transferred into a 100 mi round glass flask.<br>
The clear solution was frozen in a bed of dry ice (solid CO2) at -78 °C, and subsequently the glass<br>
flask with the frozen solution was connected to a lyophilizer. Lyophilizer type: CHRIST, BETA<br>
2-8 LD-2. The initial pressure of was about 0.10 rnbar, and the cold trap temperature was -82 °C,<br>
and the end pressure was 0.007 mbar. After about 15 hours, the lyophili/ation was complete and<br>
the flask was disconnected. The obtained white solid powder was characterized by differential<br>
scanning calorimetry and powder X-ray diffraction. PXRD for the obtained product shows the<br>
complete amorphous state, and likewise DSC measurement reveals a completely amorphous<br>
compound with a glass transition temperature near 54 °C and a ACP of about 0.5 J/g/°C.<br>
Example 7: Preparation of crystalline pure form A by re-crystallization<br>
[0149] 142.5 g of the product from Example 5 was suspended in absolute ethanol<br>
(750 ml). The white suspension was heated under stirring over 30 min to 70 °'C. From 60 °C, the<br>
solution was clear yellowish. The solution was slowly cooled and the product started to<br>
crystallize at about 48 °C. Cooling from 48 °C to 15 °C was performed over 4 h. The suspension<br>
was stirred for 1.5 h at 15 °C. Thereafter, a thick suspension was formed. The precipitate was<br>
filtered under vacuum, washed twice with 70 ml absolute ethanol and then dried in vacuum at 40<br>
°C. The dry weight was 135.2 g (95% yield).<br>
[0150] This product was again suspended under stirring in 850 ml absolute ethanol<br>
and heated over 30 min to 75 °C. The dissolution was complete and the solution was substantially<br>
colourless from 58-60 °C. The solution was filtered at 75 °C, the line was washed with 50 ml<br>
absolute ethanol, and the solution was then allowed to cool under stirring. Crystallization<br>
initiated at 48 °C. The product crystallized at about 42-44 °C and a voluminous precipitate was<br>
formed. The suspension was allowed to cool over night to room temperature. The suspension was<br>
filtered at 20-22 °C and washed twice with 50 ml absolute ethanol. The white and solid product<br>

and the suspension was stirred for 5 hours at 5 °C. The crystalline solid was filtered off and dried<br>
under nitrogen for 1 hour at room temperature. A yield of 164 mg of crystalline form D was<br>
obtained as confirmed by PXRD and Raman spectroscopy. TG-FT1R indicated a weight loss of<br>
about 8% below 170 °C, which was attributed to isopropanol and water.<br>
