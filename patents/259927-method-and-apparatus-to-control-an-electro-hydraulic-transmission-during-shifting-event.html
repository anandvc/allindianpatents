METHOD AND APPARATUS TO CONTROL AN ELECTRO-HYDRAULIC<br>
TRANSMISSION DURING SHIFTING EVENT<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] This invention pertains generally to powertrain control systems for<br>
powertrain systems having electro-mechanical transmissions, and more<br>
specifically to powertrain control during transmission shifts.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Powertrain architectures comprise torque-generative devices,<br>
including internal combustion engines and electric machines, which transmit<br>
torque through a transmission device to a vehicle driveline. One such<br>
transmission includes a two-mode, compound-split, electro-mechanical<br>
transmission which utilizes an input member for receiving motive torque from<br>
a prime mover power source, typically an internal combustion engine, and an<br>
output member for delivering motive torque from the transmission to the<br>
vehicle driveline. Electrical machines, operatively connected to an electrical<br>
energy storage device, comprise motor/generators operable to generate motive<br>
torque for input to the transmission, independently of torque input from the<br>
internal combustion engine. The electrical machines are further operable to<br>
transform vehicle kinetic energy, transmitted through the vehicle driveline, to<br>
electrical energy potential that is storable in the electrical energy storage<br>
device. A control system monitors various inputs from the vehicle and the<br>
operator and provides operational control of the powertrain system, including<br>
controlling transmission gear shifting, controlling the torque-generative<br>
devices, and regulating the electrical power interchange between the electrical<br>
energy storage device and the electrical machines.<br>
[0003] Engineers implementing powertrain systems having electro-<br>
transmissions are tasked with developing shifting schemes between various<br>
operating modes,  including fixed gear modes and continuously variable<br><br>
GP-308310-PTH-CD<br>
2<br>
modes. During execution of a shift, there can be a change in operating<br>
conditions which necessitate aborting execution of the shift. In aborting a<br>
shift, there is a need to maintain control of the transmission output to ensure<br>
that the operator is not adversely affected as a result.<br>
[0004] Therefore, there is a need to for a method and apparatus to control<br>
operation of a powertrain system including an electro-mechanical transmission<br>
during gear shifting events, to address concerns mentioned hereinabove.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0005] In order to address the concerns raised hereinabove, an article of<br>
manufacture is provided to effect a method to control torque output after a<br>
shift abort from a transmission device of an exemplary powertrain.<br>
[0006] In accordance with the present invention, there is provided an article<br>
of manufacture, comprising a storage medium having a computer program<br>
encoded therein for effecting a method to selectively actuate a plurality of<br>
torque-transfer devices of a transmission device operative to receive torque<br>
inputs from a plurality of devices and operative to transmit an output torque<br>
therefrom. The method comprises executing a shift operation from a first<br>
operating mode to a second operating mode and monitoring shift abort criteria.<br>
A revised shift operation is executed to control the transmission shift into a<br>
third operating mode effective to substantially meet an operator request for<br>
output torque, including shifting into the third operating mode when one of the<br>
shift abort criteria is met.<br>
[0007] An aspect of the invention includes the transmission device<br>
comprising a two-mode, compound-split, electro-mechanical transmission<br>
having four torque-transfer devices wherein the transmission is operable in<br>
one of four fixed gear ratio modes and two continuously variable modes. The<br>
transmission device is operably connected to a plurality of torque-generative<br>
devices comprising first and second electrical machines and an internal<br>
combustion engine.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
[0015] Referring now to the drawings, wherein the showings are for the<br>
purpose of illustrating the invention only and not for the purpose of limiting<br>
the same, Figs. 1 and 2 depict a system comprising an engine 14, transmission<br>
10, control system, and driveline which has been constructed in accordance<br>
with an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[0016] Mechanical aspects of exemplary transmission 10 are disclosed in<br>
detail in commonly assigned U.S. Patent No. 6,953,409, entitled "Two-Mode,<br>
Compound-Split, Hybrid Electro-Mechanical Transmission having Four Fixed<br>
Ratios", which is incorporated herein by reference. The exemplary two-mode,<br>
compound-split, electro-mechanical hybrid transmission embodying the<br>
concepts of the present invention is depicted in Fig. 1, and is designated<br><br>
GP-308310-PTH-CD<br>
4<br>
generally by the numeral 10. The transmission 10 has an input shaft 12 that is<br>
preferably directly driven by an engine 14. A transient torque damper 20 is<br>
incorporated between the output shaft 18 of the engine 14 and the input<br>
member 12 of the transmission 10. The transient torque damper 20 preferably<br>
comprises a torque transfer device 77 having characteristics of a damping<br>
mechanism and a spring, shown respectively as 78 and 79. The transient<br>
torque damper 20 permits selective engagement of the engine 14 with the<br>
transmission 10, but it must be understood that the torque transfer device 77 is<br>
not utilized to change, or control, the mode in which the transmission 10<br>
operates. The torque transfer device 77 preferably comprises a hydraulically<br>
operated friction clutch, referred to as clutch C5.<br>
[0017] The engine 14 may be any of numerous forms of internal combustion<br>
engines, such as a spark-ignition engine or a compression-ignition engine,<br>
readily adaptable to provide a power output to the transmission 10 at a range<br>
of operating speeds, from idle, at or near 600 revolutions per minute (RPM), to<br>
over 6,000 RPM. The engine 14 is connected to the input member 12 which is<br>
connected to a planetary gear set 24 in the transmission 10.<br>
[0018] Referring specifically now to Fig. 1, the transmission 10 utilizes three<br>
planetary-gear sets 24, 26 and 28. The first planetary gear set 24 has an outer<br>
ring gear member 30 which circumscribes an inner, or sun gear member 32. A<br>
plurality of planetary gear members 34 are rotatably mounted on a carrier 36<br>
such that each planetary gear member 34 meshingly engages both the outer<br>
gear member 30 and the inner gear member 32.<br>
[0019] The second planetary gear set 26 also has an outer ring gear member<br>
38, which circumscribes an inner sun gear member 40. A plurality of planetary<br>
gear members 42 are rotatably mounted on a carrier 44 such that each<br>
planetary gear 42 meshingly engages both the outer gear member 38 and the<br>
inner gear member 40.<br>
[0020] The third planetary gear set 28 also has an outer ring gear member<br>
46, which circumscribes an inner sun gear member 48. A plurality of planetary<br>
gear members 50 are rotatably mounted on a carrier 52 such that each<br><br>
GP-308310-PTH-CD<br>
5<br>
planetary gear 50 meshingly engages both the outer gear member 46 and the<br>
inner gear member 48.<br>
[0021] The three planetary gear sets 24, 26 and 28 each comprise simple<br>
planetary gear sets. Furthermore, the first and second planetary gear sets 24<br>
and 26 are compounded in that the inner gear member 32 of the first planetary<br>
gear set 24 is conjoined through a hub plate gear 54 to the outer gear member<br>
38 of the second planetary gear set 26. The conjoined inner gear member 32 of<br>
the first planetary gear set 24 and the outer gear member 38 of the second<br>
planetary gear set 26 are connected to a first electrical machine comprising a<br>
motor/generator 56, also referred to as "MG-A".<br>
[0022] The planetary gear sets 24 and 26 are further compounded in that the<br>
carrier 36 of the first planetary gear set 24 is conjoined through a shaft 60, to<br>
the carrier 44 of the second planetary gear set 26. As such, carriers 36 and 44<br>
of the first and second planetary gear sets 24 and 26, respectively, are<br>
conjoined. The shaft 60 is also selectively connected to the carrier 52 of the<br>
third planetary gear set 28, through a torque transfer device 62 which, as will<br>
be hereinafter more fully explained, is employed to assist in the selection of<br>
the operational modes of the transmission 10. The carrier 52 of the third<br>
planetary gear set 28 is connected directly to the transmission output member<br>
64.<br>
[0023] In the embodiment described herein, wherein the transmission 10 is<br>
used in a land vehicle, the output member 64 is operably connected to a<br>
driveline 90 comprising a gear box or other torque transfer device which<br>
provides a torque output to one or more vehicular axles or half-shafts. The<br>
axles terminate in drive members, which may be either front or rear wheels of<br>
the vehicle on which they are employed, or they may be a drive gear of a track<br>
vehicle.<br>
[0024] The inner gear member 40 of the second planetary gear set 26 is<br>
connected to the inner gear member 48 of the third planetary gear set 28,<br>
through a sleeve shaft 66 that circumscribes shaft 60. The outer gear member<br>
46 of the third planetary gear set 28 is selectively connected to ground,<br><br>
GP-308310-PTH-CD<br>
6<br>
represented by the transmission housing 68, through a torque transfer device<br>
70. Torque transfer device 70, as is also hereinafter explained, is also<br>
employed to assist in the selection of the operational modes of the<br>
transmission 10. The sleeve shaft 66 is also connected to a second electrical<br>
machine comprising a motor/generator 72, referred to as MG-B.<br>
[0025] All the planetary gear sets 24, 26 and 28 as well as MG-A and MG-B<br>
56 and 72 are preferably coaxially oriented, as about the axially disposed shaft<br>
60. MG-A and MG-B 56 and 72 are both of an annular configuration which<br>
permits them to circumscribe the three planetary gear sets 24, 26 and 28 such<br>
that the planetary gear sets 24, 26 and 28 are disposed radially inwardly of the<br>
MG-A and MG-B 56 and 72.<br>
[0026] A torque transfer device 73 selectively connects the sun gear 40 with<br>
ground, i.e., with transmission housing 68. A torque transfer device, i.e. C4 75<br>
is operative as a lock-up clutch, locking planetary gear sets 24, 26, MG-A and<br>
MG-B 56, 72 and the input to rotate as a group, by selectively connecting the<br>
sun gear 40 with the carrier 44. The torque transfer devices 62, 70, 73, 75 are<br>
all preferably friction clutches, respectively referred to as follows: clutch Cl<br>
70, clutch C2 62, clutch C3 73, and clutch C4 75. Each clutch is preferably<br>
hydraulically actuated, receiving pressurized hydraulic fluid from a pump<br>
when a corresponding clutch control solenoid is actuated. Hydraulic actuation<br>
of each of the clutches is accomplished using a hydraulic fluid circuit having a<br>
plurality of fiuidic pressure solenoids and flow management valves, which is<br>
not described in detail herein.<br>
[0027] The transmission 10 receives input motive torque from the torque-<br>
generative devices, including the engine 14 and the MG-A 56 and MG-B 72,<br>
as a result of energy conversion from fuel or electrical potential stored in an<br>
electrical energy storage device (ESD) 74. The ESD 74 typically comprises<br>
one or more batteries. Other electrical energy and electrochemical energy<br>
storage devices that have the ability to store electric power and dispense<br>
electric power may be used in place of the batteries without altering the<br>
concepts of the present invention.   The ESD 74 is preferably sized based<br><br>
GP-308310-PTH-CD<br>
7<br>
upon factors including regenerative requirements, application issues related<br>
to typical road grade and temperature, and propulsion requirements such as<br>
emissions, power assist and electric range. The ESD 74 is high voltage DC-<br>
coupled to transmission power inverter module ('TPIM') 19 via DC lines or<br>
transfer conductors 27. The TPIM 19 is an element of the control system<br>
described hereinafter with regard to Fig. 2. The TPIM 19 communicates<br>
with the first electrical machine 56 by transfer conductors 29, and the TPIM<br>
19 similarly communicates with the second electrical machine 72 by transfer<br>
conductors 31. Electrical current is transferable to or from the ESD 74 in<br>
accordance with whether the ESD 74 is being charged or discharged. TPIM<br>
19 includes the pair of power inverters and respective motor control modules<br>
configured to receive motor control commands and control inverter states<br>
therefrom for providing motor drive or regeneration functionality.<br>
[0028] In motoring control, the respective inverter receives current from<br>
the DC lines and provides AC current to the respective electrical machine,<br>
i.e. MG-A and MG-B, over transfer conductors 29 and 31. In regeneration<br>
control, the respective inverter receives AC current from the electrical<br>
machine over transfer conductors 29 and 31 and provides current to the DC<br>
lines 27. The net DC current provided to or from the inverters determines<br>
the charge or discharge operating mode of the electrical energy storage<br>
device 74. Preferably, MG-A 56 and MG-B 72 are three-phase AC<br>
machines and the inverters comprise complementary three-phase power<br>
electronics.<br>
[0029] Referring again to Fig. 1, a drive gear 80 may be driven from the<br>
input member 12. As depicted, the drive gear 80 fixedly connects the input<br>
member 12 to the outer gear member 30 of the first planetary gear set 24, and<br>
the drive gear 80, therefore, receives power from the engine 14 and/or the<br>
electrical machines 56 and/or 72 through planetary gear sets 24 and/or 26. The<br>
drive gear 80 meshingly engages an idler gear 82 which, in turn, meshingly<br><br>
GP-308310-PTH-CD<br>
8<br>
engages a transfer gear 84 that is secured to one end of a shaft 86 secured to a<br>
hydraulic/transmission fluid pump 88.<br>
[0030] Referring now to Fig. 2, a schematic block diagram of the control<br>
system, comprising a distributed control module architecture, is shown. The<br>
elements described hereinafter comprise a subset of an overall vehicle control<br>
architecture, and are operable to provide coordinated system control of the<br>
powertrain system described herein. The control system is operable to<br>
synthesize pertinent information and inputs, and execute algorithms to control<br>
various actuators to achieve control targets, including such parameters as fuel<br>
economy, emissions, performance, driveability, and protection of hardware,<br>
including batteries of ESD 74 and MG-A and MG-B 56, 72. The distributed<br>
control module architecture includes engine control module ('ECM') 23,<br>
transmission control module ('TCM') 17, battery pack control module<br>
('BPCM') 21, and Transmission Power Inverter Module ('TPIM') 19. A<br>
hybrid control module ('HCP') 5 provides overarching control and<br>
coordination of the aforementioned control modules. There is a User Interface<br>
('UI') 13 operably connected to a plurality of devices through which a vehicle<br>
operator typically controls or directs operation of the powertrain through a<br>
request for torque including the transmission 10. Exemplary vehicle operator<br>
inputs to the UI 13 include an accelerator pedal, a brake pedal, transmission<br>
gear selector, and, vehicle speed cruise control. Each of the aforementioned<br>
control modules communicates with other control modules, sensors, and<br>
actuators via a local area network ('LAN') bus 6. The LAN bus 6 allows for<br>
structured communication of control parameters and commands between the<br>
various control modules. The specific communication protocol utilized is<br>
application-specific. The LAN bus and appropriate protocols provide for<br>
robust messaging and multi-control module interfacing between the<br>
aforementioned control modules, and other control modules providing<br>
functionality such as antilock brakes, traction control, and vehicle stability.<br>
[0031] The HCP 5 provides overarching control of the hybrid powertrain<br>
system, serving to coordinate operation of the ECM 23, TCM 17, TPIM 19,<br><br>
GP-308310-PTH-CD<br>
9<br>
and BPCM 21. Based upon various input signals from the Ul 13 and the<br>
powertrain, including the batter}' pack, the HCP 5 generates various<br>
commands, including: an operator torque an engine torque command, clutch<br>
torque commands for the various clutches Cl, C2, C3, C4 of the transmission<br>
10; and motor torque commands.<br>
[0032] The ECM 23 is operably connected to the engine 14, and functions to<br>
acquire data from a variety of sensors and control a variety of actuators,<br>
respectively, of the engine 14 over a plurality of discrete lines collectively<br>
shown as aggregate line 35. The ECM 23 receives the engine torque<br>
command from the HCP 5, and generates a desired axle torque, and an<br>
indication of actual engine torque input to the transmission, which is<br>
communicated to the HCP 5. For simplicity, ECM 23 is shown generally<br>
having bi-directional interface with engine 14 via aggregate line 35. Various<br>
other parameters that may be sensed by ECM 23 include engine coolant<br>
temperature, engine input speed (Ni) to shaft 12 leading to the transmission,<br>
manifold pressure, ambient air temperature, and ambient pressure. Various<br>
actuators that may be controlled by the ECM 23 include fuel injectors, ignition<br>
modules, and throttle control modules.<br>
[0033] The TCM 17 is operably connected to the transmission 10 and<br>
functions to acquire data from a variety of sensors and provide command<br>
signals to the transmission. Inputs from the TCM 17 to the HCP 5 include<br>
estimated clutch torques for each of the clutches Cl, C2, C3, and, C4 and<br>
rotational speed, No, of the output shaft 64. Other actuators and sensors may<br>
be used to provide additional information from the TCM to the HCP for<br>
control purposes.<br>
[0034] The BPCM 21 is signally connected one or more sensors operable to<br>
monitor electrical current or voltage parameters of the ESD 74 to provide<br>
information about the state of the batteries to the HCP 5. Such information<br>
includes battery state-of-charge, battery voltage and available battery power.<br>
[0035] The Transmission Power Inverter Module (TPIM) 19 includes a<br>
pair of power inverters and motor control modules configured to receive<br><br>
GP-308310-PTH-CD<br>
10<br>
motor control commands and control inverter states therefrom to provide<br>
motor drive or regeneration functionality. The TPIM 19 is operable to<br>
generate torque commands for MG-A 56 and MG-B 72 based upon input<br>
from the HCP 5, which is driven by operator input through UI 13 and<br>
system operating parameters. The motor torque commands for MG-A and<br>
MG-B are implemented by the control system, including the TPIM 19, to<br>
control MG-A and MG-B. Individual motor speed signals for MG-A and<br>
MG-B respectively, are derived by the TPIM 19 from the motor phase<br>
information or conventional rotation sensors. The TPIM 19 determines and<br>
communicates motor speeds to the HCP 5. The electrical energy storage<br>
device 74 is high-voltage DC-coupled to the TPIM 19 via DC lines 27.<br>
Electrical current is transferable to or from the TPIM 19 in accordance with<br>
whether the ESD 74 is being charged or discharged.<br>
[0036] Each of the aforementioned control modules is preferably a general-<br>
purpose digital computer generally comprising a microprocessor or central<br>
processing unit, storage mediums comprising read only memory (ROM),<br>
random access memory (RAM), electrically programmable read only memory<br>
(EPROM), high speed clock, analog to digital (A/D) and digital to analog<br>
(D/A) circuitry, and input/output circuitry and devices (I/O) and appropriate<br>
signal conditioning and buffer circuitry. Each control module has a set of<br>
control algorithms, comprising resident program instructions and calibrations<br>
stored in ROM and executed to provide the respective functions of each<br>
computer. Information transfer between the various computers is preferably<br>
accomplished using the aforementioned LAN 6.<br>
[0037] Algorithms for control and state estimation in each of the control<br>
modules are typically executed during preset loop cycles such that each<br>
algorithm is executed at least once each loop cycle. Algorithms stored in the<br>
non-volatile memory devices are executed by one of the central processing<br>
units and are operable to monitor inputs from the sensing devices and execute<br>
control and diagnostic routines to control operation of the respective device,<br>
using preset calibrations.    Loop cycles are typically executed at regular<br><br>
GP-308310-PTH-CD<br>
11<br>
intervals, for example each 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25 and 100 milliseconds during<br>
ongoing engine and vehicle operation. Alternatively, algorithms may be<br>
executed in response to occurrence of an event.<br>
[0038] In response to an operator's action, as captured by the UI 13, the<br>
supervisory HCP control module 5 and one or more of the other control<br>
modules determine requested output torque at shaft 64, also referred to as an<br>
operator torque request. Selectively operated components of the transmission<br>
10 are appropriately controlled and manipulated to respond to the operator<br>
demand. For example, in the exemplary embodiment shown in Fig. 1 and 2,<br>
when the operator has selected a forward drive range and manipulates either<br>
the accelerator pedal or the brake pedal, the HCP 5 determines output torque<br>
which affects how and when the vehicle accelerates or decelerates. Final<br>
vehicle acceleration is affected by other factors, including, e.g., road load,<br>
road grade, and vehicle mass. The HCP 5 monitors the parametric states of<br>
the torque-generative devices, and determines the output of the transmission<br>
required to arrive at the desired torque output.<br>
[0039]    The  two-mode,   compound-split,   electro-mechanical  transmission,<br>
includes output member 64 which receives output torque through two distinct<br>
gear trains within the transmission 10, and operates in several transmission<br>
operating modes, described with reference now to Fig. 1, and Table 1, below.<br>
Table 1<br><br>
Transmission Operating Mode	Actuated	Clutches	<br>
Mode I	Cl 70		<br>
Fixed Ratio 1 (GR1)	Cl 70	C4	75<br>
Fixed Ratio 2 (GR2)	Cl 70	C2	62<br>
Mode II	C2 62		<br>
Fixed Ratio 3 (GR3)	C2 62	C4	75<br>
Fixed Ratio 4 (GR4)	C2 62	C3	73<br>
[0040] The various transmission operating modes described in the table<br>
indicate which of the specific clutches Cl, C2, C3, C4 are engaged or actuated<br>
for each of the operating modes.    Additionally, in various transmission<br><br>
GP-308310-PTH-CD<br>
12<br>
operating modes, MG-A and MG-B may each operate as electrical motors to<br>
generate motive torque, or as a generator to generate electrical energy. A first<br>
mode, or gear train, is selected when the torque transfer device 70 is actuated<br>
in order to "ground" the outer gear member 46 of the third planetary gear set<br>
28. A second mode, or gear train, is selected when the torque transfer device<br>
70 is released and the torque transfer device 62 is simultaneously actuated to<br>
connect the shaft 60 to the carrier 52 of the third planetary gear set 28. Other<br>
factors outside the scope of the invention affect when the electrical machines<br>
56, 72 operate as motors and generators, and are not discussed herein.<br>
[0041] The control system, shown primarily in Fig. 2, is operable to provide<br>
a range of transmission output speeds, No, of shaft 64 from relatively slow to<br>
relatively fast within each mode of operation. The combination of two modes<br>
with a slow-to-fast output speed range in each mode allows the transmission<br>
10 to propel a vehicle from a stationary condition to highway speeds, and meet<br>
various other requirements as previously described. Additionally, the control<br>
system coordinates operation of the transmission 10 so as to allow<br>
synchronized shifts between the modes.<br>
[0042] The first and second modes of operation refer to circumstances in<br>
which the transmission functions are controlled by one clutch, i.e. either clutch<br>
Cl 62 or C2 70, and by the controlled speed and torque of the electrical<br>
machines 56 and 72, which can be referred to as a continuously variable<br>
transmission mode. Certain ranges of operation are described below in which<br>
fixed ratios are achieved by applying an additional clutch. This additional<br>
clutch may be clutch C3 73 or C4 75, as shown in the table, above.<br>
[0043] When the additional clutch is applied, fixed ratio of input-to-output<br>
speed of the transmission, i.e. N/No, is achieved. The rotations of machines<br>
MG-A and MG-B 56, 72 are dependent on internal rotation of the mechanism<br>
as defined by the clutching and proportional to the input speed, N,, determined<br>
or measured at shaft 12. The machines MG-A and MG-B function as motors<br>
or generators.<br><br>
GP-308310-PTH-CD<br>
13<br>
[0044] Referring now to Fig. 3, various transmission operating modes are<br>
plotted as a function of transmission output speed, No, and transmission input<br>
speed, N, for the exemplary transmission and control system shown in Fig. 1<br>
and 2. The Fixed Ratio operation is shown as individual lines for each of the<br>
specific gear ratios, GR1, GR2, GR3, and GR4, as described with reference to<br>
Table 1, above. The continuously variable Mode operation is shown as ranges<br>
of operation for each of Mode I and Mode II. The transmission operating<br>
mode is switched between Fixed Ratio operation and continuously variable<br>
Mode operation by activating or deactivating specific clutches. The control<br>
system is operative to determine a specific transmission operating mode based<br>
upon various criteria, using algorithms and calibrations executed by the<br>
control system, and is outside the scope of this invention.<br><br>
GP-308310-PTH-CD<br>
14<br>
[0045] Selection of the mode of operation of the transmission depends<br>
primarily on operator input and the ability of the powertrain to meet that input.<br>
Referring again to Fig. 3 and Table 1, a first range falls primarily within mode<br>
I operation when clutches C1 70 and C4 75 are engaged. A second range falls<br>
within mode I and mode II when clutches C2 62 and Cl 70 are engaged. The<br>
first fixed gear ratio is available during mode I, when clutches Cl and C4 are<br>
engaged. The second fixed gear ratio is available during mode I, when<br>
clutches Cl and C2 are engaged. The third fixed ratio range is available<br>
during mode II when clutches C2 62 and C4 75 are engaged, and the fourth<br>
fixed ratio range is available during mode II when clutches C2 62 and C3 73<br>
are engaged. It should be recognized that the first and second ranges of<br>
continuously variable operation for Mode I and Mode II may overlap.<br>
[0046] Output of the exemplary powertrain system described hereinabove is<br>
constrained due to mechanical and system limitations. The output speed, No,<br>
of the transmission measured at shaft 64 is limited due to limitations of engine<br>
output speed and transmission input speed, H, measured at shaft 12, and speed<br>
limitations of the MG-A and MG-B. Output torque of the transmission 64 is<br>
similarly limited due to limitations of the engine input torque and input torque<br>
measured at shaft 12 after the transient torque damper 20, and torque<br>
limitations of MG-A and MG-B 56, 72.<br>
[0047] In operation, a shift occurs in the exemplary transmission due to a<br>
variety of operating characteristics of the powertrain. There may be a change<br>
in demand for an operator demand for torque, typically monitored at shaft 64.<br>
Such demands are typically communicated through inputs to the UI 13 as<br>
previously described. Additionally, a change in demand for output torque may<br>
be predicated on a change in external conditions, including, e.g. changes in<br>
road grade, road surface conditions, or wind load. A shift change may be<br>
predicated on a change in powertrain torque demand caused by a control<br>
module command to change one of the electrical machines between electrical<br>
energy generating mode and torque generating mode. A shift change may be<br>
predicated on a change in an optimization algorithm or routine operable to<br><br>
GP-308310-PTH-CD<br>
15<br>
determine optimum system efficiency based upon operator demand for power,<br>
battery state of charge, and energy efficiencies of the engine 14 and MG-A<br>
and MG-B 56, 72. The control system manages torque inputs from the engine<br>
14 and MG-A and MG-B 56, 72 based upon an outcome of the executed<br>
optimization routine, and there can be changes in system optimization that<br>
compel a shift change in order to optimize system efficiencies to improve fuel<br>
economy and manage battery charging. Furthermore, a shift change may be<br>
predicated upon a fault in a component or system.<br>
[0048] The distributed control architecture acts in concert to determine a<br>
need for a change in the transmission operating state, and executes the<br>
forgoing to effect the change in gear. Permissible transitions between the<br>
various transmission operating modes for the exemplary transmission are<br>
shown, with reference to Table 2, below.<br>
Table 2<br><br>
Transmission	Permissible Shift Options<br>
Operating Mode	<br>
Model	GR1.GR2, Neutral<br>
Mode II	GR2, GR3, GR4, Neutral<br>
GR1	Mode I, GR2, Neutral<br>
GR2	Mode I, Mode II, GR1, GR3, GR4,<br>
	Neutral<br>
GR3	GR2, GR4, Mode II, Neutral<br>
GR4	GR2, GR3, Mode II, Neutral<br>
Neutral	Mode I, Mode II<br>
[0049] A shift change in the exemplary system comprises one of at least<br>
three possible situations, consistent with the permissible shifts shown in Table<br>
2. There can be a shift from one fixed gear to a second fixed gear. There can<br>
be a shift from a fixed gear to one of the continuously variable modes. There<br>
can be a shift from one of the continuously variable modes to a fixed gear.<br><br>
GP-308310-PTH-CD<br>
16<br>
[0050] When a shift is from one fixed gear to a second fixed gear, the shift<br>
process includes deactivating an off-going clutch, and actuating an oncoming<br>
clutch. By way of example, in shifting from GR1 to GR2, off-going clutch C4<br>
75 is deactivated, and oncoming clutch C2 62 is actuated, permitting it to<br>
transmit torque. Clutch Cl 70 is actuated throughout the process. Actuating<br>
an oncoming clutch preferably includes synchronizing the speeds of the<br>
elements of the oncoming clutch by controlling the torque-generative devices<br>
and, if necessary, controlling slippage of the oncoming clutch.<br>
[0051] A shift change out of any of the fixed gear operating modes is a<br>
multi-step process, wherein torque transmitted across the off-going clutch is<br>
preferably offloaded prior to its deactivation. Offloading torque across the<br>
off-going clutch includes adjusting torque-carrying across other torque-<br>
transmission paths, e.g. using MG-A or MG-B, and the oncoming clutch.<br>
Deactivating an off-going clutch comprises decreasing the torque-carrying<br>
capacity of the off-going clutch by reducing hydraulic pressure through<br>
control of one of the solenoids, as previously described.<br>
[0052] To effect a shift into a fixed gear, torque is offloaded from the off-<br>
going clutch and it is deactivated. An input side of the oncoming clutch is<br>
preferably synchronized with the speed of an output of the oncoming clutch<br>
and slippage is controlled to minimize heat generation in the oncoming clutch<br>
while preventing or reducing driveline jerks and lurches. The oncoming clutch<br>
is actuated by controlling hydraulic pressure applied to the clutch to a<br>
magnitude sufficient to hold the clutch with zero slip across the clutch<br>
elements. Regardless of the type of shift being executed, a shift change takes<br>
a finite amount of time to execute, typically targeted for less than one second,<br>
and is predicated upon specific circumstances that are monitored and<br>
controlled by the control system described hereinabove.<br>
[0053] During execution of a shift, there can be a detectable change in<br>
operation which causes the control system to abort the shift change currently<br>
in process. Such operating changes are analogous to those which initiated the<br>
shift change, i.e. a subsequent change in demand for output torque due to<br><br>
GP-308310-PTH-CD<br>
17<br>
operator input or external conditions, a command by the control module to<br>
change one of the electrical machines between electrical energy generating<br>
mode and torque generating mode, a change in the optimization algorithm<br>
operable to optimize system efficiency, or a fault in a component or system,<br>
including a fault in an oncoming clutch. Specific parametric threshold values<br>
for each of the abort criteria are calibrated for a specific application.<br>
[0054] The invention generally comprises an algorithm resident in one of the<br>
modules of the control system and executed therein, which acts to implement a<br>
method to effect a shift from a first operating mode to a second operating<br>
mode, based upon criteria previously described. The algorithm monitors the<br>
detectable changes in operation which comprise the shift abort criteria,<br>
described above. When one of the abort criteria is met, a revised shift<br>
operation is executed, which controls shift execution into a third operating<br>
mode. The selected third operating mode is selected as being an operating<br>
mode which is effective to substantially meet the operator request for output<br>
torque, To as currently determined. This is described in greater detail.<br>
[0055] Referring now to Fig. 4, a logic flow chart, executed as an algorithm<br>
in the control system described with reference to Fig. 2 for controlling the<br>
powertrain system described with reference to Fig. 1, is described for a<br>
situation wherein a command to abort the shift occurs during a period when<br>
the off-going clutch is not completely deactivated. In this situation, the<br>
control system monitors whether any of the abort criteria have been met<br>
during a shifting event (Blocks 110, 112). When one of the abort criteria has<br>
been met, it is determined whether the off-going ('OG') clutch has sufficient<br>
carrying capacity, i.e. hydraulic pressure, to continue operation (Block 114).<br>
When the off-going clutch has sufficient carrying capacity, the control system<br>
determines whether to abort back to the previously commanded fixed gear, or,<br>
alternatively, whether a shift to another allowable operating mode has been<br>
commanded based upon a change in operating conditions (Block 116). If the<br>
control system chooses to abort to the original fixed gear, hydraulic pressure is<br>
increased to the previously off-going clutch, and the hydraulic pressure is<br><br>
GP-308310-PTH-CD<br>
18<br>
decreased to the previously oncoming ('OC') clutch, if any (Block 118). This<br>
change in hydraulic pressures to the off-going and oncoming clutches is<br>
continued until the clutch capacity of the previously off-going clutch is<br>
sufficient to transmit torque thereacross (Block 120), and operation continues<br>
(Block 122). When the off-going clutch does not have sufficient carrying<br>
capacity (block 114), or when a shift to another operating mode has been<br>
commanded based upon the changed situation (Block 116), the control system<br>
continues to command a reduction in hydraulic pressure to the off-going<br>
clutch (Block 124), permitting its deactivation in time, once slippage of the<br>
off-going clutch is observed, typically based upon measurement on output<br>
speed No (Block 126). Pressure to the oncoming clutch is similarly reduced,<br>
preventing its actuation (block 124). The third operating mode is selected as<br>
one of the continuously variable Mode operating modes, i.e. in Mode I or<br>
Mode II (Block 128), and a new operating range is subsequently determined<br>
and executed as a shift event, e.g. to another fixed gear. The above-described<br>
situation is applicable to shift changes when the off-going operating mode is<br>
one of the fixed gears.<br>
[0056] Fig. 5 comprises an exemplary data graph of transmission input<br>
speed, Ni, as a function of time, and showing a situation wherein a command<br>
to abort a shift event occurs after the off-going clutch has been deactivated, in<br>
this example shown as a shift event from GR2 to GR3 (Line A), wherein<br>
clutch Cl 70 has been deactivated (Point 130). At Point 140, there is a<br>
command to abort the shift event, as previously described. In this situation,<br>
the selected third operating mode which the control system can command<br>
includes a return to GR2 (Line B), or a shift to GR4 (Line C) or to an optimal<br>
operating line for continuously variable Mode 2, shown as Opti_N1_M2 (Line<br>
D). Regardless of the selected third operating mode, the control system<br>
selectively controls operation of the engine, MG-A, and MG-B to achieve a<br>
transmission output which is effective to substantially meet the operator<br>
request for output torque as currently determined.    In these circumstances,<br><br>
GP-308310-PTH-CD<br>
19<br>
operating speeds of the engine, MG-A, and MG-B are selectively controlled to<br>
meet the output speed Noof the transmission to meet the output torque.<br>
