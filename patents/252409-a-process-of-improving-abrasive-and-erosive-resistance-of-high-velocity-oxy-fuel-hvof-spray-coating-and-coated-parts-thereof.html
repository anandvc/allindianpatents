FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a novel method of High Velocity Oxy Fuel (HVOF) spray<br>
coating followed by surface grindng. More specifically the present invention<br>
relates to combating silt and cavitation erosion of the hydro turbine components,<br>
which are prone to erosion.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Degradation of Indian hydro turbine components such as spears / needles, guide<br>
vanes, lower ring, top cover, labyrinth seals, etc. is a serious problem. This is<br>
mainly due to presence of excessive silt in water during monsoon. In hydro<br>
turbines there are basically two type of erosion. They are silt and cavitation<br>
erosion. The silt comprising hard quartz (hardness on Moh scale is 7) particles of<br>
size ranging from 10 to 200 microns striking on the exposed surfaces of the<br>
hydro components. This problem is particularly acute during rainy season when<br>
excessive land slides on to the riverbed cause the number of silt particles to<br>
increase in excess of 5000 ppm. This kind of erosion on the components is called<br>
silt erosion. The second type of erosion is cavitation. If the pressure of a fluid<br>
drops below its vapour pressure due to an increase in its velocity or otherwise,<br>
vapour bubbles tend to form. These bubbles grow their size at low pressure and<br>
when they come in contact with regions of high pressure, i.e. on the runner<br>
surface or draft tube, etc. they collapse and implode. Over a period of time,<br>
small pits are developed on the surface of the component exposed to repetitive<br>
collapse of the bubbles thereby causing erosion of the base material. This<br>
phenomenon is called cavitation.<br>
Attempts are being made to reduce the above damage caused by silt erosion<br>
either by reducing the particle velocity, controlling their size and concentration,<br><br>
3<br>
or by using HVOF cermet coatings. HVOF cermet of hard carbide phase (WC)<br>
embedded in ductile matrix; typically coating system consisting of WC-Co, WC-<br>
Co-Cr, WC-Ni-Cr and FeCrAIY-Cr3C2 are being used in different industries.<br>
Tungsten carbide (WC) based powders are widely used in the HVOF spraying<br>
system because of their high wear and corrosion resistance. These are used to<br>
produce dense, high hardness and excellent wear resistance coatings generally<br>
to combat the erosion and corrosion occurring in hydro power plants and pumps.<br>
The present invention in the above retrospective has proposed to develop a<br>
process of increasing the wear resistance of the components subjected to high<br>
abrasive conditions during their use in adverse conditions on increasing the wear<br>
resistance of carbide coatings on the components put up in high abrasive<br>
conditions.<br>
Power generation by hydro turbine is one of the major sources in Nothern India.<br>
These Hydro turbines operate under silted water condition. Due to high silt<br>
content, the hydro turbine components are eroded severely. This erosion leads<br>
to break down of the hydro power house and that lead to huge loss of electrical<br>
power.<br>
In the existing art the hydro turbine components which are worn out due to silt<br>
and cavitation erosion are coated by HVOF (high velocity oxy fuel) spray process<br>
with WC based powder. The hardness of the coating is 1150 to 1200 Hv. The<br>
coating is highly dense compare to other thermal spray techniques like plasma<br>
spray. In applications where abrasive or erosive wear resistance is of primary<br>
importance, Wc-Co with and without chromium is used. Wc-Co-Cr powders are<br>
preferred when high corrosion resistance is needed. The abrasive and erosive<br>
wear resistance also depends upon oxides, pores, and the phase transformation<br>
occurring during spraying. High velocity oxy fuel sprayed coatings are commonly<br>
applied by HP/HVOF JP-5000, DS-100, Met jet II, Diamond jet and<br><br><br>
Praxair 2000 HVAF (High velocity air fuel) systems. These systems are based on<br>
liquid as well as gaseous fuel and oxygen/air.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention has been developed on finding effect of surface grinding<br>
of WC-Co based HVOF coating on considering the extent of damage specifically<br>
caused in the hydroturbine components employed in the Himalayan region.<br>
According to the invention main objective is to improve the erosion resistance of<br>
carbide based HVOF coating on machine components subjected to adverse<br>
erosive conditions by surface grinding of coating.<br>
Another objective of the invention is to improve the erosion resistance of WC-Co<br>
based HVOF coating by surface grinding of hydroturbine components coated with<br>
the same.<br>
A still another objective of the invention is to increase the wear resistance of any<br>
alloy coating and coated parts thereof on subjecting the coating to abrasion.<br>
Yet another objective of the invention is to decrease the wear rate of the coating<br>
and thus enhancing life of the coating and coated parts thereof by abrasive<br>
wheel grinding of the coating.<br>
In order to improve the performance of the hydro turbine components, high<br>
velocity oxy fuel (HVOF) coating has been applied and it has given good result.<br>
For further improvement, surface grinding was carried out with a diamond<br>
abrasive wheel. Different thicknesses of surface grinding were carried out, to see<br>
the behaviour in erosion resistance. It was found that when a WC-CoCr based<br>
HVOF coated surface is ground 200 microns thick it gives better erosion<br>
resistance than as-coated surface. Approximately 30% increase in erosion<br><br><br>
resistance was observed compare to as-coated sample. High erosion<br>
resistance was due to increase in coating hardness from 1106 to 1472 Hv<br>
(Vickers Hardness). This hardness increase was due to increase in<br>
residual stress of the coating after surface grinding.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
The present invention will be better understood from the following<br>
illustrative embodiment with reference to drawing in which:<br>
Figure 1 represents effect of surface grinding on hardness of HVOF<br>
coated samples, and<br>
Figure 2 represents effects of surface grinding on erosive wear resistance<br>
of WC-Co-Cr based coating.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
Metjet-II system from Metallization, UK was used for HVOF. This is<br>
based on liquid fuel (Kerosesne of aviation grade) and oxygen gas. The<br>
HVOF spray gun was mounted on a 6-axis ABB robot for carrying out the<br>
HVOF coating. This coating was carried out inside an acoustic chamber<br>
because the HVOF coating process produces very heavy noise. The<br>
coating thickness was maintained around 500 microns for all the<br>
samples. To see the effect of grinding, four sets of samples were made.<br>
The details of the samples are given in Table -1. After the coated<br>
samples were ground using diamond abrasive wheel and the grinding<br>
parameters are maintained as given in Table-2 on the samples tested<br>
according to table 1. The grinding was carried out with water soluble<br>
coolant and the final surface roughness for all the samples were<br>
maintained around 0.2 µm.<br><br><br>
Microhardness (At 300 grams load) result on testing the samples on above<br>
parameter maintenance is shown in Table-3. For comparison, the hardness was<br>
also measured on an AISi 410 stainless steel plate. The hardness values show<br>
that there is a substantial increase in hardness of HVOF coating after grinding.<br>
/The increase in hardness was highest when the grinding thickness was 200<br>
microns (Hv 1472) If it is compared with the as-coated sample then three is<br>
almost 33% increase in, hardness which is observed over the as-coated sample<br>
(Hv 1106). The trend of hardness after different level of grinding is shown in Fig.<br>
1. The hardness after 300 microns grinding decreased to 1348 Hv. Such increase<br>
in hardness of coating is due to increase in residual stress imparted on the<br>
coating after surface grinding.<br><br><br>
The erosive wear rate of the HVOF coated samples with different grinding thicknesses<br>
decreases upto 200 micron, and thereafter increases as given in Fig. 2. From the said<br>
figure, it is observed that the wear rate of as coated sample is higher than the ground<br>
sample. Volume loss (wear rate) of as coated sample is 1.74 mm3 and that of ground<br>
samples are around 0.62 mm3, from which it is concluded that by surface grinding, the<br>
coating gets more wear resistant and enhancing life of the coating and thus the coated<br>
parts than as-coated samples. The increase in wear resistance is attributed to the increase<br>
in microhardness of the coating because the wear rate is directly proportional with the<br>
hardness of the material being subjected to wear. The volume loss of the coating was<br>
calculated by taking the coating density of 13.8 g/cm3.<br>
Though the present invention has been narrated with an exemplary embodiment the said<br>
invention should not be read and construed in a restrictive manner as some alterations,<br>
modifications and adaptations are possible in respect of various coatings of alloy or<br>
carbides on various machine parts subjected to adverse abrasive and erosive conditions<br>
within the scope and limit of the invention as defined in the appended claims.<br><br>
