DESCRIPTION<br>
2-AMINO-BICYCLO [3.1.0] HEXANE-2,6-DICARBOXYLIC ESTER DERIVATIVE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a parmaceutically effective 2-amino -bicyclo [3.1.0] hexane -2, 6-dicarboxylic ester derivative, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, a hydrate thereof or a prodrug containing the above as an active ingredient. More specifically, the present invention relates to a prodrug of 2-amino- bicyclo [3.1.0] hexane -2,6-dicarboxylic acid derivative and so on that are a compound that acts as an antagonist of mGlu2/mGluR3 belonging to sub group II of metabolic (metabotropic) glutamate receptors (mGluR), which is effective for the treatment and prevention of psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, anxiety and related ailments thereof, depression, bipolar disorder and epilepsy; and also of neurological diseases such as drug dependence, cognitive disorders, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's chorea, Parkinson's disease, dyskinesia associated with muscular rigidity, cerebral ischemia, cerebral failure, myelopathy and head trauma.<br>
Further, the present invention relates to the finding that a prodrug of a compound that acts as an antagonist of mGIuR2/mGluR3 shows high activity in oral administration and increases the amount of exposure in vivo of the parent compound.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Metabotropic glutamate receptors are classified pharmacologically into three groups. Of these, group II (mGluR2/mGluR3) bind with adenylcyclase, and inhibit the accumulation of the Forskolin stimulation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) (see Trends Pharmacol. Sci., 14, 13,1993 (non-patent document 1 mentioned below)). Thus it is suggested that compounds that antagonize the action of group II metabotropic glutamate receptors are effective for the treatment and prevention of acute and chronic psychiatric disorders and neurological diseases. A 2-amino -bicyclo [3.1.0] hexane -2,6 -dicarboxylic acid derivative is a compound that has a strong antagonistic effect on group II metabotropic glutamate receptors.<br><br>

Trends Pharmacol. ScL, 14, 13,1993<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a drug that is effective for the treatment and prevention of psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, anxiety and related ailments thereof, depression, bipolar disorder and epilepsy; and also effective for the treatment and prevention of neurological diseases such as drug dependence, cognitive disorders, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's chorea, Parkinson's disease, dyskinesia associated with muscular rigidity, cerebral ischemia, cerebral failure, myelopathy and head trauma; which is a drug that antagonizes the action of group II metabotropic glutamate receptors and shows high activity in oral administration.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present inventors have conducted extensive examinations into 2-amino -bicyclo [3.1.0] hexane-2,6-dicarboxylic ester derivatives, and by conducting animal tests with a parent compound as the test drug, discovered that a prodrug of a 2-amino -bicyclo [3.1.0] hexane-2,6-dicarboxylic acid derivative that affects group II metabotropic glutamate receptors increases the amount of exposure in vivo of the parent compound, thereby completing the present invention.<br>
