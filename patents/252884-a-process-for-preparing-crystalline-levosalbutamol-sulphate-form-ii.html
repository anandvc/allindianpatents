COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See section 10, rule 13)<br>
PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOUNDS AND COMPOSITIONS'<br>
CIPLA LIMITED of 289 Bellasis Road, Mumbai Central, Mumbai 400 008, India.<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
Pharmaceutical Compounds and Compositions<br>
The present invention relates to crystalline levosalbutamol sulphate, polymorphs thereof, processes for making the crystalline material, and compositions thereof. <br>
5<br>
It also relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective isomer of salbutamol in combination with a glucocorticoid, the composition being useful for the treatment of respiratory disorders including bronchoconstriction, asthma, COPD and related disorders thereof.<br>
10    Asthma is described as a chronic disease that involves inflammation of the pulmonary airways and bronchiai hyperresponsiveness that results in the clinical expression of a lower airway obstruction that usually is reversible. The pathophysiology of asthma or related disorders involves bronchoconstriction resulting from bronchial smooth muscle spasm and airway inflammation with mucosal edema. Treatment of asthma<br>
15    and other related disorders have been known to employ (3-2 agonists, also known as p"-2 adrenoreceptor agonists. Such b—2 adrenoreceptor agonists are known to provide a bronchodilator effect to patients, resulting in relief from the symptoms of breathlessness. More particularly, b-2 adrenoreceptor agonists have been shown to increase the conductance of potassium channels in airway muscle cells, leading to<br>
20  membrane hyperpolarization and relaxation. Short-acting beta2 adrenoreceptors like salbutamol and terbutaline are recommended for the relief of acute symptoms, while long-acting agents like salmeterol, formoterol and bambuterol are used preferably in combination with other drugs for long-term asthma control.<br>
         Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a preventable and treatable             disease state characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible. COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) is an umbrella term used to describe lung disease associated with airflow obstruction. The airflow limitation is usually progressive and associated with an abnormal inflammatory response of the lungs to noxious particles or gases, primarily caused by cigarette smoking.<br><br>
2<br><br><br>
Bronchodilators are the mainstay of therapy for patients with established chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) but, at present, the majority of patients use (3-agonists.<br>
Salbutamol pressurized inhalation is official in the British pharmacopoeia and are                5     used for the treatment of asthma.<br>
Dey pharmaceutical's patent US 6,702,997 relates to an albuterol inhalation solution, system, kit and method for relieving bronchospasm in children suffering from asthma which comprises about 0.63 mg or about 1.25 mg albuterol.<br>
10<br>
US6,251,368 relates to a pharmaceutical aerosol formulation that comprises particulate                                medicament selected from the group consisting of salmeterol, salbutamol, fluticasone  propionate, beclomethasone dipropionate and physiologically acceptable salts and solvates thereof and a fluorocarbon or hydrogen-containing chlorofluorocarbon propellant, which formulation is substantially free of surfactant is disclosed<br>
15<br>
US 5,547,994 by Sepracor describes a method for treating asthma, using the optically pure R (-) isomer of albuterol, which is substantially free of the S(+) isomer, is a potent bronchodilator for relieving the symptoms associated with asthma in individuals.<br>
20<br>
CN1413976 by Suzhou Junning New Drug Dev CT (CN), which describes the synthesis of levosalbutamol.<br>
US patent application number US2004054215 by CIPLA Limited discloses a method 25      for obtaining an optically pure R-isomer of albuterol.<br>
Several methods for preparation of levalbuterol have been described in the prior art such as US patent application number 20040115136 by King Code which describes a<br>
3<br><br>
method of preparation of levalbuterol tartrate. It further relates to levalbuterol L-tartrate possessing properties desirable for use in a metered dose inhaler.<br>
Salbutamol (albuterol) is an antihistaminic compound and is a beta 2-adrenoceptor                          agonist used as a bronchodilator for the treatment of asthma and as a uterine relaxant for    the suspension of premature labour. Salbutamol has been marketed as a racemic mixture, although the beta 2-agonist activity resides almost exclusively in the (R)-enantiomer. The enantioselective disposition of salbutamol and the possibility that (S)-salbutamol has adverse effects have led to the development of an enantiomerically 					   10     pure (R)-salbutamol formulation known as levosalbutamol (levalbuterol) (Formula I).<br><br>
Formula I<br>
15     A process for the preparation of optically pure salbutamol from mono protected salbutamol precursor is disclosed in US5545745.<br>
US2004114136 and WO2004052835 describe a process for preparing levalbuterol L-tartrate in crystalline form; a pharmaceutical composition comprising levalbuterol L-                tartrate, in crystalline form; a metered dose inhaler comprising a canister containing an aerosol formulation of levalbuterol L-tartrate in crystalline form; and a method of affecting bronchodilation in a patient using levalbuterol L-tartrate, including levalbuterol L-tartrate specifically in crystalline form.<br>
25     Levosalbutamol is prepared by hydrogenating R-benzyl salbutamol in the presence of palladium on carbon.<br>
4<br><br>
R-benzyl salbutamol can be prepared by the process described in United States patent number 5,545,745.<br>
5     Studies have proved that racemic albuterol, a commonly used bronchodilator, is an exact 50:50 mixture of two enantiomers, R- and S- isomers of salbutamol. Only the R-enantiomer (levosalbutamol) is a potent b2 -adrenoceptor stimulant, whereas the S-enantiomer (dextrosalbutamol) shows little or no adrenoceptor activity.<br>
10   Among the different classes of drugs which are usually administered by inhalation for the treatment of respiratory diseases, glucocorticosteroids such as beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP), dexamethasone, flunisolide, budesonide, fluticasone propionate are of great importance. They can be administered in the form of a finely divided, i.e. micronised, powder, formulated as suspension in an aqueous phase containing any<br>
15     necessary surfactants and/or cosolvents; when intended to be administered in the form of metered doses of aerosol spray, they should also contain a low-boiling propellant.<br>
The effectiveness of the administration form depends on the deposition of an adequate amount of particles at the action site. One of most critical parameters determining the<br>
20    proportion of inhalable drug which will reach the lower respiratory tract of a patient is the size of the particles emerging from the device. In order to ensure an effective penetration into the bronchioli and alveoli and hence ensure a high respirable fraction, the mean aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) of the particles should be lower than 5-6 microns. For nasal administration, particles with higher MMAD are required.<br>
25<br>
Fluticasone propionate is itself known from GB2088877 to have anti-inflammatory activity and to be useful for the treatment of allergic and inflammatory conditions of the nose, throat, or lungs such as asthma and rhinitis, including hay fever. Fluticasone propionate in aerosol form, has been accepted by the medical community as useful in<br>
30     the treatment of asthma and is marketed under the trademarks Flovent I and<br>
5<br><br>
"Flonase". Fluticasone propionate may also be used in the form of a physiologically acceptable solvate.<br>
    HK1009406 relates to a metered dose inhaler for dispensing an inhalation drug                              5     formulation  comprising  fluticasone  propionate,  or  a  physiologically  acceptable solvate thereof, and a fluorocarbon propellant, optionally in combination with one or more other pharmacologically active agents or one or more excipients.<br>
   We have appreciated that the use of a combination of salbutamol or a physiologically                  10     acceptable salt thereof and inhaled corticosteroid has clinical advantages in the treatment of COPD over the use of salbutamol alone or corticosteroid alone.<br>
U.S Pat. No. 6013245 relates to a pharmaceutical aerosol formulation which comprises particulate anhydrous beclomethasone dipropionate together with 15 1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoro-n-propane as propellant, which formulation is free of surfactant The formulation may also contain salbutamol and includes a canister suitable for delivery and a method of treating respiratory disorders administering the formulation by inhalation.<br>
20  U.S. Pat. No. 2004136920 relates to aerosol formulations to be administered as inhalation and which comprises particulate salbutamol and physiologically acceptable salts and solvates thereof and a fluorocarbon or hydrogen-containing chlorofluorocarbon propellant, substantially free of surfactant. The patent also describes a method of treating respiratory disorders which comprises administration<br>
25   by inhalation of an effective amount of a pharmaceutical aerosol formulation as defined is also described.<br>
   The  present   invention   aims   to  provide   a  potent  pharmaceutical   composition     comprising a therapeutically effective isomer of salbutamol or a salt, solvate, ester,                       30     derivative or polymorph thereof in combination with an inhaled corticosteroid.<br><br>

There is also provided a process for the manufacture of a pharmaceutical composition                   5   comprising a therapeutically effective isomer of salbutamol or a salt, solvate, ester, derivative or polymorph thereof in combination with a glucorticoid drug along with at least one pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, which method comprises mixing the ingredients to form the said composition.<br>
10     The invention also provides a composition of the invention for use as a medicament.<br>
The composition of the invention is also provided for treating respiratory disorders and related conditions, including bronchoconstriction, asthma and COPD.<br>
15   The present invention also provides for a method for the treatment in a mammal, such as a human, of respiratory disorders such as asthma, disorders resulting in bronchoconstriction, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) which method comprises administration of a therapeutically effective amount of a pharmaceutical composition according to present invention.<br>
20<br>
Beta2 adrenoreceptors are known to provide a bronchodilator effect to patients by acting on the b-2 adrenergic receptors in the airway smooth muscles and the bronchial smooth muscles, resulting in relief from the symptoms of breathlessness. More particularly, they have been shown to increase the conductance of potassium channels<br>
25   in airway muscle cells, leading to membrane hyperpolarization and relaxation. They are thus preferred in case of asthma treatment that requires the dilation of the bronchial smooth muscles and relieves the patient of breathlessness associated with asthma. More particularly the short acting beta2 adrenoreceptors are very useful since they provide a quicker onset of action and hence faster relief.<br>
30<br><br>
8<br><br><br>
The present invention relates to one such short acting beta2 adrenoreceptor, salbutamol. The salbutamol is available as a racemic mixture comprising R and S form. But only the R-enantiomer (levosalbutamol) is a potent b2 -adrenoceptor stimulant, whereas the S-enantiomer (dextrosalbutamol) shows little or no                                                                                   5     adrenoceptor activity. The bronchodilatory property of racemic salbutamol is attributable entirely to (R)- salbutamol, which has an approximately 100 fold greater binding affinity for beta2 receptors as compared to (S)- salbutamol. In vitro, (S)-salbutamol has been reported to promote intracellular Ca 2+ influx in airway smooth muscle-cells and augment cholinergic activation of airway smooth muscles. Thus in 10 the absence of (R)-salbutamol, (S)-salbutamol has the potential to induce bronchoconstriction in asthmatic patients. This divergent pharmacology accentuates the need of levosalbutamol over racemic salbutamol in the treatment of asthma and other airway diseases.<br>
15  Also levosalbutamol is a more potent bronchodilator when administered as the single enantiomer compared with die same amount in a racemic mixture. Levosalbutamol produces comparable efficacy at nearly one-fourth the dose of racemic salbutamol,<br>
simultaneously reducing the beta-mediated side effects.<br>
20  Accordingly the present invention further provides aerosol formulations in accordance with the invention which contain two or more particulate medicaments. Medicaments may be selected from suitable combinations of the medicaments mentioned hereinbefore or may be selected from any other suitable drug useful in inhalation therapy. Preferably, the medicament may be presented in a form which is<br>
25     substantially completely insoluble in the selected propellant.<br>
Appropriate medicaments may thus be selected from, for example, analgesics, e.g. codeine, dihydromorphine, ergotamine, fentanyl or morphine; anginal preparations, e.g. diltiazem; antiallergics, e.g. cromoglycate, ketotifen or nedocromil; antiinfectives e.g.   cephalosporins,   penicillins,   streptomycin,   sulphonamides,   tetracyclines   and<br><br>
9<br><br><br>
pentamidine; antihistamines, e.g. methapyrilene; anti-inflamrnatories, e.g. flunisolide, budesonide, tipredane or triamcinolone acetonide; antitussives, e.g. noscapine; bronchodilators, e.g. ephedrine, adrenaline, fenoterol, formoterol, isoprenaline, metaproterenol phenylephrine, phenylpropanolamine, pirbuterol reproterol rimiterol,                     5     terbutaline, isoetharine, tulobuterol orciprenaline, or (-)-amino-3,5-dichloro-[alpha]-[[[6-[2-(2-pyridinyl)ethoxy]hexyl] amino]methyl]benzenemethanol; diuretics, e.g. amiloride; anticholinergics e.g. ipratropium, atropine or oxitropium; hormones, e.g. cortisone, hydrocortisone or prednisolone; xanthines e.g. aminophylline, choline theophyllinate, lysine theophyllinate or theophylline; and therapeutic proteins and 10 peptides, e.g. insulin or glucagon. It will be clear to a person skilled in the art that, where appropriate, the medicaments may be used in the form of salts (e.g. as alkali metal or amine salts or as acid addition salts) or as esters (e.g. lower alkyl esters) or as solvates (e.g. hydrates) to optimize the activity and/or stability of the medicament and/or to minimise the solubility of the medicament in the propellant.<br>
15    Commercially available pharmacopoeial composition of salbutamol containing the racemic form comprises 100 to 200 meg of salbutamol but a composition according to the present invention contains almost half the dose, or even less, and is therapeutically<br>
more effective by the use of the R form of salbutamol; levosalbutamol. Due to the reduced dosage, there are less cardiovascular complications, which are associated                                  20        with higher doses of bronchodilators. Therefore the use of such therapeutically effective isomer results in increased patient compliance.<br>
Hence the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective isomer of salbutamol or a salt, solvate, ester, derivative or polymorph thereof that avoids side effects associated with higher racemic dosages.                                        <br><br>
The term 'levosalbutamol' is used in the entire specification and claims in a broad sense to include not only levosalbutamol per se but also its pharmaceutically available salts, derivatives or polymorphs thereof. The pharmaceutically available salts of levosalbutamol     include     levosalbutamol     sulphate,     levosalbutamol     tartrate,<br><br><br>
10<br><br><br>
levosalbutamol  hydrochloride.   The   salt   of levosalbutamol   used   is   preferably levosalbutamol sulphate.<br>
The active compounds and the various derivatives thereof may be made according to          5     procedures known in the art, as will be clear to the skilled person.<br>
The invention employs the most active, therapeutically speaking, isomer of salbutamol. The compositions are substantially free of the less therapeutically effective isomer, meaning that this isomer will not be present in any significant                                                                              10    amount. Suitably, such isomers will be present at no more than 10% w/w of active, more preferably 1% w/w or less. Thus, for example, compositions containing levosalbutamol, are substantially free of the S-isomer of this compound.<br>
Whilst any suitable form of composition may be used, particularly preferred                         15 compositions are aerosol, DPI or inhalation solution/suspension formulations containing levosalbutamol (e.g. as the free base or the sulphate salt) in combination with an antimflarnmatory steroid such as a beclomethasone ester (e.g. the diproprionate) or a fluticasone ester (e.g. the propionate) or an antiallergic such as cromoglycate (e.g. the sodium salt). Combinations of salbutamol and fluticasone                                                                           20   propionate or beclomethasone dipropionate or budesonide are preferred. It will be understood that for inhalable compositions such as aerosol formulations, the actives will be provided in suitably inhalable form.<br>
In the compositions of the invention, we prefer to use polymorphic forms of                                        25     levosalbutamol sulphate named herewith as Form I, Form II and Form III. These are novel compounds and constitute a further aspect of the invention.<br>
Accordingly, in one aspect, the invention provides crystalline levosalbutamol sulphate (Form I) is characterised by a powder XRD pattern with peaks at 10.8, 11.9, 13.0, 30      18.3, 28.5 ± 0.2 degrees 2 theta.<br><br>
11<br><br><br>
In another aspect, there is provided crystalline levosalbutamol sulphate (Form II) is characterised by a powder XRD pattern with peaks at 8.7, 9.6, 15.2, 15.7, 19.1, 27.2, 30.7 ± 0.2 degrees 2 theta. <br>
5<br>
In another aspect, there is provided crystalline levosalbutamol sulphate (Form III) is characterised by a powder XRD pattern with peaks at 5.5, 6.9, 7.3, 18.7 ± 0.2 degrees 2 theta.<br>
10     The invention also provides various processes for making Form I, II and III.<br>
A process for preparing crystalline levosalbutamol sulphate Form I, comprises a) preparing levosalbutamol in an organic solvent b) adjusting the pH by addition of sulphuric acid at from 1 to 10°C c) isolating the product (Form I) at from 0 to 10°C.<br>
15<br>

Figure 6 shows the IR spectrum for Form III.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
16<br><br><br>
In a process for the preparation of levosalbutamol sulphate crystalline Form III, preferably R-benzyl salbutamol is hydrogenated using a catalyst, preferably a palladium on carbon catalyst in a suitable organic solvent, preferably an alcoholic solvent, more preferably ethyl alcohol. Preferably this is done under hydrogen                                                                                             5   pressure, preferably at about 30psi. Form III can be isolated by adjusting the pH by addition of sulphuric acid at ambient temperature (25 to 30° C) and isolating the product at ambient temperature (25 to 30° C). Preferably, these steps are done by filtering the catalyst and washing, for example with denatured alcohol. The pH of the filtrate is preferably adjusted to 5-5.5 at ambient temperature (25 to 30° C) with                                                            10    sulfuric acid, preferably in concentrated form, to give crystals, which are filtered and dried to afford levosalbutamol sulphate Form III. The product (Form III) may be obtained by isolating at 25 to 30° C.<br>
Another process for the preparation of levosalbutamol sulphate crystalline Form II                15     comprises   jet   milling   levosalbutamol   sulphate.       For   example,   crystalline levosalbutamol Form I may be jet milled so as to give Form II.<br>
It will be understood that crystalline levosalbutamol sulphate and the polymorphic Forms thereof disclosed herein may be formulated with conventional excipients,<br>
20    auxiliaries and carriers into a wide variety of pharmaceutical compositions, including but not limited to tablets, capsules, pellets, caplets, MDI, DPI, and Respule formulations, and oral liquids such as syrups. Where appropriate plain or sustained release formulations may be provided. Those skilled in the art of pharmaceutical formulation will be aware of the conventional ingredients which may be employed to<br>
25    formulate the above compositions. Such formulations may be made in accordance with conventional manufacturing procedures.<br>
In particular, the compounds of the present invention may be combined with one or<br>
more other pharmaceutically active compounds, as will be clear to those skilled in the<br>
30     art.    Any suitable combination of active materials is envisaged, provided the<br><br>
17<br><br><br>
combination is acceptable from a pharmaceutical and regulatory standpoint. The compounds of the invention may, for example be combined with corticosteroids such as fluticasone, beclomethasone or budesonide; anticholinergic agents such as ipratropium, tiotropium or atropine; mucolytic agents such as ambroxol; xanthine                                                                     5     derivatives such as theophylline; antihistamines; analgesics, and bronchodilators. As will be clear, the additional active or actives may be provided in any suitable form, including the pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof, including salts, esters, polymorphs, and the optically active forms as well as the racemates.<br>
10 The invention thus provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising crystalline levosalbutamol sulphate, particularly Form I or Form II or Form III thereof, in combination with one or more pharmaceutically active compounds and, optionally, a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
15 The compositions of the present invention are preferably administered by the inhalation route so as to provide an effective amount of local action and thus avoid undesirable systemic effects. The present compositions may further comprise pharmaceutically acceptable excipients in order to provide a suitable formulation and may be made available in the form of a metered dose inhaler.<br>
20<br>
An aerosol formulation according to the present invention may optionally comprise in addition to levosalbutamol in combination with anti-inflammatory steroid or inhaled glucocorticoid and at least one propellant, other pharmaceutically acceptable agents like cosolvents, antioxidants or surfactants.<br>
25<br>
For aerosol formulations, a propellant is included in the composition. Suitable propellants include propellant 11 (dichlorodifluoromethane), propellant 12 (monofluorotrichloromethane), Propellant 114, 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (HFA134a) and 1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoropropane (HFA227), or mixtures of two or more such<br>
30     halogen-substituted hydrocarbons.<br>
18<br><br>
The aerosol formulations of the invention may be prepared by dispersal of the medicament in the selected propellant in an appropriate container, e.g. with the aid of sonication. The process is desirably carried out under anhydrous conditions to obviate                                              5     any adverse effects of moisture on suspension stability.<br>
10<br>
The formulations according to the invention form weakly flocculated suspensions on standing but, surprisingly, these suspensions have been found to be easily redispersed      by mild agitation to provide suspensions with excellent delivery characteristics suitable for use in pressurized inhalers, even after prolonged storage. Minimising and preferably avoiding the use of formulation excipients e.g. surfactants, cosolvents etc in the aerosol formulations according to the invention is also advantageous since the formulations may be substantially taste and odour free, and less irritant and less toxic than conventional formulations.<br>
15<br>
20<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention an aerosol composition may comprise a therapeutically effective isomer of salbutamol a salt, solvate, ester, derivative or polymorph thereof with an anti-inflammatory steroid or inhaled glucocorticoid and either propellant 11 or propellant 114 or a combination thereof and propellant 12.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the present invention the aerosol may comprise a therapeutically effective isomer of salbutamol or a salt, solvate, ester, derivative or polymorph thereof with inhaled glucocorticoid and either propellant 11 or propellant                                        25      114 or a combination thereof and propellant 12 with a surfactant.<br>
During the trial for this formulation it was observed that in the absence of a surfactant<br>
the drug failed to form a homogenous dispersion. Various surfactants known in the art<br>
were tried like oils such as corn oil, olive oil, cottonseed oil and sunflower seed oil,<br>
30     mineral oils like liquid paraffin, oleic acid and also phospholipids such as lecithin, or<br><br><br>
19<br><br><br>
sorbitan fatty acid esters like sorbitan oleate. Lecithin gave a comparatively good suspension quality when levosalbutamol sulphate was used in combination with fluticasone and budesonide. The preferred surfactant was oleic acid in case of levosalbutamol sulphate used in combination with beclomethasone.<br>
5<br>
The surfactant can be used in a concentration of 0.001-100% by weight of the total active material. Preferably in a range of l%-50%. More preferably in a concentration of 5%-30%. The concentration of surfactant according to the present invention is preferably 10% (all by weight of the total active material).   Typically, the active<br>
10     material will constitute two actives e.g. levosalbutamol and the glucocorticoid.<br>
In the compositions for inhalation particle size is particularly important. The preferred particle size is between 2 um to 5um. It has also been found that the particle size has a considerable influence on the proportion of active substance in the aerosol which is             15     delivered for inhalation.<br>
In another triaL drugs were mixed with propellant 11 or propellant 114 or a combination thereof, filled in canisters, crimped and charged with propellant 12. It was found that this gave a low FPD (fine particle dose). Hence further trials were<br>
20   undertaken where both the drugs and/or surfactant were micro-milled with propellant 11 or propellant 114 or a combination thereof to form a slurry and then filled in canisters, charging with propellant 12. This resulted in a better FPD as compared to the CFC aerosols where the micro-milling as described herein was not done. Hence micro-milling is preferably done in order to achieve a better FPD.<br>
25<br>
