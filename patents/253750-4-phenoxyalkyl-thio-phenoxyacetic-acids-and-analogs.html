CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This Application claims priority to United States Provisional Patent<br>
Application No. 60/609,942, filed September 15, 2004, which is hereby<br>
incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The invention features 4-((phenoxyalkyl)thio)-phenoxyacetic acids and<br>
analogs, compositions containing them, and methods of using them.<br>
Background<br>
The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are metabolic<br>
sensors regulating the expression of genes involved in glucose and lipid<br>
homeostasis. Agonists of the PPARa subtype, such as LOPID® (gemfibrozil)<br>
and TRICOR® (fenofibrate), and agonists of the PPARy subtype, such as<br>
AVANDIA® (rosiglitazone maleate), are used for the treatment of dyslipidemia<br>
and diabetes, respectively. Another member of this nuclear receptor family, the<br>
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPAR delta or PPAR8) is also a<br>
necessary transcription factor reported to be involved in regulating genes<br>
involved in lipid metabolism and energy expenditure. PPAR delta has been<br>
shown to act as a "gateway" receptor modulating the expression of the other<br>
PPARs (Shi et al., 2002, Proc Natl. Acad. Sci USA, 99(5): 2613-2618). Each<br>
receptor subtype has a distinct tissue distribution: 1) PPARa shows the highest<br>
expression in liver, 2) PPARy appears primarily in adipose tissue, and 3) PPARS<br><br>
has the widest distribution - ubiquitously in adult rat (Braissant et al., 1996,<br>
Endocrinology 137(1): 354-366) and in all the human tissues tested to date,<br>
including liver, kidney, abdominal adipose and skeletal muscle (Auboeuf et al.,<br>
1997, Diabetes 46(8):319-1327).<br>
The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR alpha or<br>
PPARa) is a necessary transcription factor regulating genes relating to fatty acid<br>
metabolism and insulin action. The genes regulated by PPAR alpha include<br>
enzymes involved in the beta-oxidation of fatty acids, the liver fatty acid transport<br>
protein, and apo A1, an important component of high density lipoproteins (HDL).<br>
Selective, high affinity PPAR alpha agonists increase hepatic fatty acid oxidation,<br>
which in turn decreases circulating triglycerides and free fatty acids.<br>
Examples of known PPAR alpha agonists variously useful for<br>
hyperlipidemia, diabetes, or atherosclerosis include fibrates such as fenofibrate<br>
(Fournier), gemfibrozil (Parke-Davis/Pfizer, Mylan, Watson), clofibrate (Wyeth-<br>
Ayerst, Novopharm), bezafibrate, and ciprofibrate and ureidofibrates such as GW<br>
7647, GW 9578, and GW 9820 (GlaxoSmithKline).<br>
Diabetes is a disease caused, or contributed to, by multiple factors and<br>
characterized by hyperglycemia which may be associated with increased and<br>
premature mortality due to an increased risk for microvascular and<br>
macrovascular diseases such as nephropathy, neuropathy, retinopathy,<br>
atherosclerosis, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), hypertension, ischemia,<br>
stroke, and heart disease. Type I diabetes (IDDM) results from genetic<br>
deficiency of insulin, the hormone regulating glucose metabolism. Type II<br>
diabetes is known as non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), and is<br>
due to a profound resistance to insulin regulatory effect on glucose and lipid<br>
metabolism in the main insulin-sensitive tissues, i.e., muscle, liver and adipose<br>
tissue. This insulin resistance or reduced insulin sensitivity results in insufficient<br>
insulin activation of glucose uptake, oxidation and storage in muscle and<br><br>
inadequate insulin repression of lipolysis in adipose tissue as well as glucose<br>
production and secretion in liver. Many Type II diabetics are also obese, and<br>
obesity is believed to cause and/or exacerbate many health and social problems<br>
such as coronary heart disease, stroke, obstructive sleep apnoea, gout,<br>
hyperlipidemia, osteoarthritis, reduced fertility, and impaired psychosocial<br>
function.<br>
A class of compounds, thiazolidinediones (glitazones), have been<br>
suggested to be capable of ameliorating many symptoms of NIDDM by binding to<br>
the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) family of receptors. They<br>
increase insulin sensitivity in muscle, liver and adipose tissue in several animal<br>
models of NIDDM resulting in correction of the elevated plasma levels of glucose,<br>
triglycerides and nonesterified free fatty acids without any occurrence of<br>
hypoglycemia. However, undesirable effects have occurred in animal and/or<br>
human studies including cardiac hypertrophy, hemadilution and liver toxicity.<br>
Many PPARy agonists currently in development have a thiazolidinedione<br>
ring as a common structural element. PPARy agonists have been demonstrated<br>
to be extremely useful for the treatment of NIDDM and other disorders involving<br>
insulin resistance. Troglitazone, rosiglitazone, and pioglitazone have been<br>
approved for treatment of Type II diabetes in the United States. There is also<br>
some indication that benzimidazole-containing thiazolidinedione derivatives may<br>
be used to treat irritable bowel disorder (IBD), inflammation, and cataracts (JP<br>
10195057).<br>
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is prevalent in the world and is often<br>
associated with other disease states such as diabetes and obesity. Many<br>
population studies have attempted to identify the risk factors for CVD; of these,<br>
high plasma levels of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high plasma<br>
levels of triglycerides (&gt;200 mg/dl), and low levels of high density lipoprotein<br><br>
cholesterol (HDL-C) are considered to be among the most important. Currently,<br>
there are few therapies targeting low HDL-C and triglycerides.<br>
Recently, potent ligands for PPAR5 have been published, providing a<br>
better understanding of its function in lipid metabolism. The main effect of these<br>
compounds in db/db mice (Leibowitz et al., 2000, FEBS Lett. 473(3):333-336)<br>
and obese rhesus monkeys (Oliver et al., 2001, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA<br>
98(9):5306-5311) was an increase in high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C)<br>
and a decrease in triglycerides, with little effect on glucose (although insulin<br>
levels were decreased in monkeys). HDL-C removes cholesterol from peripheral<br>
cells through a process called reverse cholesterol transport. The first and rate-<br>
limiting step, a transfer of cellular cholesterol and phospholipids to the<br>
apolipoprotein A-l component of HDL, is mediated by the ATP binding cassette<br>
transporter A1 (ABCA1) (Lawn et al., 1999, J. Clin. Investigation 104(8): R25-<br>
R31). PPAR8 activation has been shown to increase HDL-C level through<br>
transcriptional regulation of ABCA1 (Oliver et al., 2001, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.<br>
USA 98(9): 5306-5311). Through induction of ABCA1 mRNA expression in<br>
macrophages, PPAR8 agonists may increase HDL-C levels in patients and<br>
remove excess cholesterol from lipid-laden macrophages, thereby inhibiting the<br>
development of atherosclerotic lesions. Existing therapy for<br>
hypercholesterolemia includes the statin drugs, which decrease LDL-C but show<br>
little effect on HDL-C, and the fibrates, the PPARa agonists that have low<br>
potency and induce only modest HDL-C elevation. In addition, like the fibrates,<br>
PPAR5 agonists may also reduce triglycerides, an additional risk factor for<br>
cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Elevated free fatty acid level has been<br>
shown to contribute to insulin resistance and progression of diabetes (Boden, G.<br>
PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN PHYSICIANS (1999<br>
May-Jun), 111(3), 241-8).<br>
Examples of known PPAR delta agonists variously useful for<br>
hypeiiipidemia, diabetes, or atherosclerosis include L-165041 (Leibowitz et al.,<br><br>
2000) and GW501516 (Oliyler et al., Proceedings of the National Academy of<br>
Sciences of the United States of America (2001), 98(9), 5306-5311).<br>
Treatment of differentiated THP-1 monocytes with GW501516 induced ABCA1<br>
mRNA expression and enhanced cholesterol efflux from these cells.<br>

Additional features and advantages of the invention will become apparent<br>
from the detailed discussion, examples, and claims below.<br><br>
Detailed Description<br>
The invention features compositions containing compounds of Formula (I)<br>
in the above Summary section, and methods of using them.<br>
Preferred compounds of the invention are PPAR delta agonists that have<br>
at least one and preferably two or three of the following characteristics when<br>
administered to patients with hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, low-<br>
HDL-C, obesity, diabetes and/or Metabolic X Syndrome: 1) increasing HDL-C<br>
level, 2) lowering triglycerides, 3) lowering free fatty acids, and 4) decreasing<br>
insulin levels. Improvement in HDL-C and triglyceride levels is beneficial for<br>
cardiovascular health. In addition, decreased level of triglycerides and free fatty<br>
acids contributes to reduce obesity and ameliorate or prevent diabetes.<br>
According to one aspect of the invention, the compounds of the invention<br>
are dual PPAR compounds; in other words, they are both PPAR delta agonists<br>
and PPAR alpha agonists, preferably where the compound's EC50 potency<br>
relating to PPAR delta is less than 0.2 µM and the potency relating to PPAR<br>
alpha is less than 3 µM. For example, more preferred dual PPAR alpha-delta<br>
agonists are those compounds having an EC50 potency relating to PPAR delta<br>
that is less than 0.03 µM and where the potency relating to PPAR alpha is less<br>
than 1 µM.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention, the compounds of the<br>
invention are pan-PPAR agonists, namely, compounds having PPAR alpha,<br>
PPAR delta, and PPAR gamma agonist activity, preferably where the EC50<br>
potency for PPAR delta is less than 0.2 µM; the potency for PPAR alpha is less<br>
than 3 µM; and the potency for PPAR gamma is less than 1 µM. More preferred<br>
pan-PPAR agonists have an EC50 potency for PPAR delta that is less than 0.03<br>
µM; a potency for PPAR alpha that is less than 1 µM; and a potency for PPAR<br>
gamma that is less than 0.7 µM.<br><br>
PPAR delta, being ubiquitously expressed, can act as a gateway receptor<br>
that regulates the expression/activity of other nuclear receptors such as other<br>
PPARs. For instance, PPAR delta has been shown to block PPARy-mediated<br>
adipogenesis and acyl-CoA oxidase expression; it has also been shown to be<br>
associated with the nuclear receptor corepressors SMRT (silencing mediator for<br>
retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors), SHARP (SMART and histone<br>
deacetylase-associated repressor protein), and HDACs (histone deacetylase).<br>
Thus, conditions directly mediated by these nuclear receptors, such as obesity<br>
and Type II diabetes, can be indirectly mediated by PPAR delta (See, for<br>
example, Shi et al., 2002, Proc Natl. Acad. Sci USA, 99(5): 2613-2618).<br>
Some aspects of the invention relate to treating hypertriglyceridemia,<br>
raising levels of HDL, lowering levels of LDL, and/or lowering total cholesterol.<br>
Preferably, the methods of treatment are associated with improvements in the<br>
extent, duration, or degree of side effects, such as edema, normally associated<br>
with other existing therapies.<br>
The invention is further described below. The specification is arranged as<br>
follows: A) Terms; B) Compounds; C) Synthesis; D) Formulation and<br>
Administration; E) Use; F) Biological Examples; G) Other Embodiments; and<br>
claims.<br><br>
A. Terms<br>
The term "subject" as used herein, refers to an animal, preferably a<br>
mammal, most preferably a human, who has been the object of treatment,<br>
observation or experiment.<br>
The term "therapeutically effective amount" as used herein, means that<br>
amount of active compound or pharmaceutical agent that elicits the biological or<br>
medicinal response in a tissue system, animal or human that is being sought by a<br>
researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician, which includes<br>
alleviation, prevention, treatment, or the delay of the onset or progression of the<br>
symptoms of the disease or disorder being treated.<br>
Conditions directly or indirectly mediated by PPAR include, but are not<br>
limited to, diabetes, nephropathy, neuropathy, retinopathy, polycystic ovary<br>
syndrome, hypertension, ischemia, stroke, irritable bowel disorder, inflammation,<br>
cataract, cardiovascular diseases, Metabolic X Syndrome, hyper-LDL-<br>
cholesterolemia, dyslipidemia (including hypertriglyceridemia,<br>
hypercholesterolemia, mixed hyperlipidemia, and hypo-HDL-cholesterolemia),<br>
atherosclerosis, obesity, and other disorders related to lipid metabolism and<br>
energy homeostasis complications thereof.<br>
For therapeutic purposes, the term "jointly effective amount" as used<br>
herein, means that amount of each active compound or pharmaceutical agent,<br>
alone or in combination, that elicits the biological or medicinal response in a<br>
tissue system, animal or human that is being sought by a researcher,<br>
veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician, which includes alleviation of the<br>
symptoms of the disease or disorder being treated. For prophylactic purposes<br>
(i.e., inhibiting the onset or progression of a disorder), the term " "jointly effective<br>
amount" refers to that amount of each active compound or pharmaceutical agent,<br>
alone or in combination, that treats or inhibits in a subject the onset or<br><br>
progression of a disorder as being sought by a researcher, veterinarian, medical<br>
doctor or other clinician. Thus, the present invention provides combinations of<br>
two or more drugs wherein, for example, (a) each drug is administered in an<br>
independently therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount; (b) at least<br>
one drug in the combination is administered in an amount that is sub-therapeutic<br>
or sub-prophylactic if administered alone, but is therapeutic or prophylactic when<br>
administered in combination with the second or additional drugs according to the<br>
invention; or (c) both (or more) drugs are administered in an amount that is sub-<br>
therapeutic or sub-prophylactic if administered alone, but are therapeutic or<br>
prophylactic when administered together.<br>

The term "Ac" as used herein, whether used alone or as part of a<br>
substituent group, means acetyl (CH3CO—). The term "acyl" as used herein,<br>
referes to a substituent that has a carbonyl group (C=O) and one or more alkyl or<br>
alkylene groups. For example, C 2-4 acyl includes without limitation, acetyl,<br>
CH3CH2 -(C=O)-CH2—, and CH3 CH2 CH2(C=O)—.<br>
The term "halogen" or "halo" shall include iodo, bromo, chloro and fluoro.<br><br>
The terms "aryl" or "Ar" as used herein refer to an unsubstituted or<br>
substituted aromatic hydrocarbon ring system such as phenyl and naphthyl. When<br>
the Ar or aryl group is substituted, it may have one to three substituents which<br>
are independently selected from C1-C8 alkyl, C1-C8 alkoxy, fluorinated C1-C8 alkyl<br>
(e.g., trifluoromethyl), fluorinated C1-C8 alkoxy (e.g., trifluoromethoxy), halogen,<br>
cyano, C1-C8 alkylcarbonyl such as acetyl, carboxyl, hydroxy, amino, nitro, C1-C4<br>
alkylamino (i.e., -NH-C1-C4 alkyl), C1-C4 dialkylamino (i.e., -N-tC1-C4 alkyl]2<br>
wherein the alkyl groups can be the same or different), or unsubstituted, mono-,<br>
di- or tri-substituted phenyl wherein the substituents on the phenyl are<br>
independently selected from C1-Ce alkyl, C1-C8 alkoxy, fluorinated C1-C8 alkyl,<br>
fluorinated C1-C8 alkoxy, halogen, cyano, acetyl, carboxyl, hydroxy, amino, nitro,<br>
alkylamino, dialkylamino or five or six membered heteroaryl having 1-3<br>
heteroatoms selected from N, O and S.<br>
The term "heteroaryl" as used herein represents a stable, unsubsituted or<br>
substituted five or six membered monocyclic or bicyclic aromatic ring system<br>
which consists of carbon atoms and from one to three heteroatoms selected from<br>
N, O and S. The heteroaryl group may be attached at any heteroatom or carbon<br>
atom which results in the creation of a stable structure. Examples of heteroaryl<br>
groups include, but are not limited to, benzimidazolyl, benzisoxazolyl,<br>
benzofuranyl, benzopyrazolyl, benzothladiazolyl, benzothiazolyl, benzothienyl,<br>
benzotriazolyl, benzoxazolyl, furanyl, furazanyl, fury I, imidazolyl, indazolyl,<br>
indolizinyl, indolinyl, indolyl, isobenzofuranyl, isoindolyl, isothiazolyl, isoxazolyl,<br>
oxazolyl, purinyl, pyrazinyl, pyrazolyl, pyridazinyl, pyridinyl, pyrimidinyl, pyrrolyl,<br>
quinolinyl, quinolyl, thiadiazolyl, thiazolyl, thiophenyl, or triazolyl. When the<br>
heteroaryl group is substituted, the heteroaryl group may have one to three<br>
substituents including, but not limited to, C1-C8 alkyl, halogen, and aryl.<br>
The term "heterocyclyl" includes optionally substituted nonaromatic rings<br>
having carbon atoms and at least one heteroatom (O, S, N) or heteroatom moiety<br>
(SO2, CO, CONH, COO) in the ring. A heterocyclyl may be saturated, partially<br><br>
saturated, nonaromatic, or fused. Examples of heterocyclyl include<br>
cyclohexylimino, imdazolidinyl, imidazolinyl, morpholinyl, piperazinyl, piperidyl,<br>
pyridyl, pyranyl, pyrazolidinyl, pyrazolinyl, pyrrolidinyl, pyrrolinyl, and thienyl.<br>
Unless otherwise indicated, heteroaryl and heterocyclyl may have a<br>
valence connecting it to the rest of the molecule through a carbon atom, such as<br>
3-furyl or 2-imidazolyl, or through a heteroatom, such as N-piperidyl or 1-<br>
pyrazolyl. Preferably a monocyclic heterocyclyl has between 5 and 7 ring atoms,<br>
or between 5 and 6 ring atoms; there may be between 1 and 5 heteroatoms or<br>
heteroatom moieties in the ring, and preferably between 1 and 3, or between 1<br>
and 2 heteroatoms or heteroatom moieties.<br>
Heterocyclyl and heteroaryl also include fused, e.g., bicyclic, rings, such<br>
as those optionally fused with an optionally substituted carbocyclic or<br>
heterocyclic five- or six-membered aromatic ring. For example, "heteroaryl"<br>
includes an optionally substituted six-membered heteroaromatic ring containing<br>
1, 2 or 3 nitrogen atoms fused with an optionally substituted five- or six-<br>
membered carbocyclic or heterocyclic aromatic ring. Said heterocyclic five- or<br>
six-membered aromatic ring fused with the said five- or six-membered aromatic<br>
ring may contain 1, 2 or 3 nitrogen atoms where it is a six-membered ring, or 1, 2<br>
or 3 heteroatoms selected from oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur where it is a five-<br>
membered ring.<br>
It is intended that the definition of any substituent or variable at a particular<br>
location in a molecule be independent of its definitions elsewhere in that<br>
molecule. It is understood that substituents and substitution patterns on the<br>
compounds of this invention can be selected by one of ordinary skill in the art to<br>
provide compounds that are chemically stable and that can be readily<br>
synthesized by techniques known in the art as well as those methods set forth<br>
herein.<br><br>
Where chemical moieties are combined, such as in ethoxymethyl or<br>
phenylethyl, the term is described in the direction from the periphery to the<br>
connection point of the rest of the molecule. For example, ethoxymethyl is<br>
CH3CH2OCH2- and phenylethyl is a phenyl group linked by -CH2CH2- to the rest<br>
of the molecule (and not a phenyl group linked to the molecule with a CH3CH2<br>
group as a substituent on the phenyl.) Where parentheses are used, they<br>
indicate a peripheral substitution.<br>
As used herein, the term "composition" is intended to encompass a<br>
product comprising the specified ingredients in the specified amounts, as well as<br>
any product which results, directly or indirectly, from combinations of the<br>
specified ingredients in the specified amounts.<br>
Compounds of the invention are further described in the next section.<br>

C. Synthesis<br>
The invention provides methods of making the disclosed compounds<br>
according to traditional organic synthetic methods as well as matrix or<br>
combinatorial synthetic methods. Schemes A through G describe suggested<br>
synthetic routes. Using these Schemes, the guidelines below, and the examples,<br>
a person of skill in the art may develop analogous or similar methods for a given<br>
compound that are within the invention. These methods are representative of the<br>
preferred synthetic schemes, but are not to be construed as limiting the scope of<br>
the invention.<br>
One skilled in the art will recognize that synthesis of the compounds of the<br>
present invention may be effected by purchasing an intermediate or protected<br>
intermediate compounds described in any of the schemes disclosed herein. One<br>
skilled in the art will further recognize that during any of the processes for<br>
preparation of the compounds in the present invention, it may be necessary<br>
and/or desirable to protect sensitive or reactive groups on any of the molecules<br>
concerned. This may be achieved by means of conventional protecting groups,<br>
such as those described in "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis", John Wiley<br>
&amp; Sons, 1991. These protecting groups may be removed at a convenient stage<br>
using methods known from the art.<br>
Where the processes for the preparation of the compounds according to<br>
the invention give rise to mixture of stereoisomers, these isomers may be<br>
separated by conventional techniques such as preparative chromatography. The<br>
compounds may be prepared in racemic form, or individual enantiomers may be<br>
prepared either by enantiospecific synthesis or by resolution. The compounds<br>
may, for example, be resolved into their components enantiomers by standard<br>
techniques, such as the formation of diastereomeric pairs by salt formation. The<br>
compounds may also be resolved by formation of diastereomeric esters or<br>
amides, followed by chromatographic separation and removal of the chiral<br><br>
auxiliary. Alternatively, the compounds may be resolved using a chiral HPLC<br>
column.<br>
Examples of the described synthetic routes include Examples 1 through 7.<br>
Compounds analogous to the target compounds of these examples can be made<br>
according to similar routes. The disclosed compounds are useful in basic<br>
research and as pharmaceutical agents as described in the next section.<br>

acid); DCC (1,3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide); DCE (1,2-dichloroethane); DIC (2-<br>
dimethylaminoisopropyl chloride hydrochloride); DIEA (diisopropylethylamine);<br>
DMAP (4-(dimethylamino)pyridine); DMF (dimethylformamide); EDC (1-(3-<br>

In accordance with Scheme 1, wherein Ri, R2, R5 and R6 are as described<br>
above (except that R5 and R6 do not form spiro C3-6 cycloalkyl or spiro 5- or 6-<br>
membered heterocyclyl), phenol 1-A, a variety of which are commercially<br>
available (such as 3-methylphenol, 2-ethylphenol, 2-propylphenol, 2,3-<br>
dimethylphenol, 2-chlorophenol, 2,3-dichlorophenol, 2-bromophenol, and 2-<br>
aminophenol), is alkylated to form phenoxyacetic acid ethyl ester 1-B with a<br>
suitable haloacetic acid ester such as bromoacetic acid ethyl ester or 2-bromo-2-<br>
methylpropionic acid ethyl ester, in the presence of an appropriate base such as<br>
Cs2C03, K2CO3, or NaH, in a suitable solvent such as CH3CN or THF.<br>
Sulfonation of the phenoxyacetic acid ethyl ester 1-B with an appropriate<br>
sulfonating agent, such as chlorosulfonic acid, occurs selectively at the para<br>
position to provide 4-chlorosulfonylphenoxyacetic acid ethyl ester 1-C.<br>
Transformation of the sulfonylchloride 1-C to benzenethiol 1-D is accomplished<br>
using a metal as a reducing agent, such as tin or zinc, in an acidic medium such<br>
as ethanol or dioxane.<br><br><br>
In Scheme 2, R7 substituted diethyl malonate 2-A is reduced to propane-<br>
1,3-diol 2-B by using a suitable reducing agent such as lithium aluminum hydride<br>
or diisobutylaluminum hydride. Mitsunobu reaction of 2-B with phenol 2-C<br>
provides compound 2-D by employlng a triarylphosphine such as<br>
triphenylphosphine, and an azodicarbonyl reagent such as diisopropyl<br>
azodicarboxylate, in a suitable solvent such as THF. Phenoxyacetic acid ethyl<br>
ester 2-E is obtained in two steps: (1) conversion of the alcohol 2-D to mesylate<br>
under standard conditions by employlng methanesulfonyl chloride and<br>
triethylamine in an appropriate solvent such as CH2CI2, and (2) alkylation of<br>
benzenethiol 1-D, prepared according to Scheme 1 above, with the mesylate<br>
intermediate using a suitable base such as CS2CO3, K2CO3, or NaH, in an<br>
appropriate solvent such as CH3CN or THF, under nitrogen. Under standard<br>
saponification conditions phenoxyacetic acid ethyl ester 2-E is converted to acid<br>
la under nitrogen. The preferred hydrolysis conditions include using NaOH as a<br>
base in an aqueous alcoholic solvent system such as water-methanol, or using<br>
LiOH as a base in a milder water-THF system.<br>
Scheme 3. Synthesis of Compound Ia1<br><br><br>
In Scheme 3, enantiomerically pure phenylacetic acid 3-A, a variety of<br>
which are commercially available (such as (S)-(+)-2-phenylpropionic acid, (R)-(-)-<br>
2-phenylpropionic acid, (S)-(+)-2-phenylbutyric acid, (R)-(-)-2-phenylbutyric acid,<br>
(+)-3-methyl-2-phenylbutyric acid, (S)-(+)-2-phenylsuccinic acid, and (R)-(-)-2-<br>
phenylsuccinic acid), is reduced to alcohol by using borane and the alcohol is<br>
subsequently protected as an acetate 3-B under standard conditions known in<br>
arts. Oxydation of the phenyl group in 3-B to acid 3-C is accomplished by<br>
employlng catalytic amount of ruthenium chloride and a large excess of sodium<br><br>
periodate in a mixed solvent system such as CH3CN-CCI4-H20. Acid 3-C is<br>
converted to alcohol 3-E in four steps: (1) methylation of acid 3-C using<br>
(trimethysilyl)diazomethane as a methylating agent, (2) and (3) exchanging of the<br>
hydroxyl protecting group from acetate in 3-C to tert-butyldimethyl silyloxy in 3-E<br>
under conventional conditions well known in arts, and (4) reduction of methyl<br>
ester by using an appropriate reducing agent such as diisobutylaluminum<br>
hydride.<br>
Phenoxyacetic acid ethyl ester 3-F is obtained in two steps: (1) conversion<br>
of the alcohol 3-E to mesylate under standard conditions by employlng<br>
methanesulfonyl chloride and triethyl amine in an appropriate solvent such as<br>
CH2CI2, and (2) alkylation of benzenethiol 1-D, prepared according to Scheme 1<br>
above, with the mesylate intermediate using a suitable base such as CS2CO3,<br>
K2CO3, or NaH, in an appropriate solvent such as CH3CN or THF, under<br>
nitrogen. After revealing of the hydroxyl group by removal of the tert-<br>
butyldimethyl silyloxy group in 3-F, alcohol 3-G is transformed to 3-H by reacting<br>
with phenol 2-C under Mitsunobu conditions. The preferred conditions include<br>
using a triarylphosphine such as triphenylphosphine, and an azodicarbonyl<br>
reagent such as diisopropyl azodicarboxylate, in a suitable solvent such as THF.<br>
Under standard saponification conditions phenoxyacetic acid ethyl ester 3-H is<br>
converted to acid Ia1 under nitrogen. The preferred hydrolysis conditions include<br>
using NaOH as a base in an aqueous alcoholic solvent system such as water-<br>
methanol, or using LiOH as a base in a milder water-THF system.<br>
Scheme 4. Synthesis of Compound Ia2<br><br><br>
In Scheme 4, benzenethiol 1-D is dimerized to phenyl disulfide 4-A in the<br>
presence of an appropriate oxidizing agent such as barium manganate.<br>
Mitsunobu reaction of 2-hydroxymethylpropane-1,3-diol 4-B with phenol 2-<br>
C provides compound 4-C by employlng a triarylphosphine such as<br>
triphenylphosphine, and an azodicarbonyl reagent such as diisopropyl<br>
azodicarboxylate, in a suitable solvent such as THF. The formation of carbon-<br>
sulfur bond in compound 4-D is carried out by Mitsunobu reaction of diol 4-C with<br>
phenyl disulfide 4-A by using tri-n-butylphosphine and pyridine. The third<br>
Mitsunobu reaction of 4-D with acetone cyanohydrin converted the alcohol 4-D to<br>
the cyano compound 4-E under standard Mitsunobu reaction conditions. As<br>
usual, basic hydrolysis of phenoxyacetic acid ethyl ester 4-E affords acid Ia2.<br>
Scheme 5. Synthesis of Compound Ia3<br><br><br>
As shown in Scheme 5, wherein R is alkyl or aryl, alkyl ether compound 5-<br>
A could be prepared by alkylation of alcohol 4-D, an intermediate prepared in<br>
Scheme 4 above, with a variety of alkylating agents such as alkyl<br>
trifluoromethanesulfonates or alkyl halides in the presence of a suitable base<br>
such as sodium hydride or sodium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide. Similarly, aryl ether<br>
could be synthesized by Mitsunobu reaction of 4-D with many different<br>
substituted phenols available. Finally, saponification of ethyl ester 5-A under<br>
standard conditions gives acid Ia3.<br>
Scheme 6. Synthesis of Compound Ia4<br><br><br>
In accordance with Scheme 6, Mitsunobu reaction of (R)-(+)-glycidol, or<br>
(S)-(-)-glycidol, or racemic glycidol 6-A with phenol 2-C provides epoxide 6-B by<br>
employlng a triarylphosphine such as triphenylphosphine, and an azodicarbonyl<br>
reagent such as diisopropyl azodicarboxylate, in a suitable solvent such as THF.<br>
Epoxide ring opening of 6-B with benzenethiol 1-D in the presence of a catalytic<br>
amount of tetrabutylammonium fluoride furnishes alcohol 6-C. Alkyl ether<br>
compound 6-D could be prepared by alkylation of alcohol 6-C with a variety of<br>
alkylating agents such as alkyl trifluoromethanesulfonates or alkyl halides in the<br>
presence of a suitable base such as sodium hydride or sodium<br>
bis(trimethylsilyl)amide in a suitable solvent such as THF or DMF. Similarly, aryl<br>
ether 6-D could be synthesized by Mitsunobu reaction of 6-C with many different<br>
substituted phenols available by using triphenylphosphine and an appropriate<br>
azodicarbonyl reagent such as 1,1'-(azodicarbonyl)dipiperidine or diethyl<br>
azodicarboxylate. Finally, saponification of ethyl ester 6-D under standard<br>
conditions gives acid Ia4.<br>
Scheme 7. Synthesis of Intermediate 7-E<br><br><br>
In accordance with Scheme 7, (4-hydroxyphenyl) acetic acid 7-A, a variety<br>
of which are commercially available (such as 3-bromo-4-hydroxyphenyl acetic<br>
acid, 3-chloro-4-hydroxyphenyl acetic acid, 3-fluoro-4-hydroxyphenyl acetic acid,<br>
4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl acetic acid, and 4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenyl acetic acid),<br>
is methylated to form (4-hydroxyphenyl) acetic acid methyl ester 7-B in methanol<br>
in the presence of a catalytic amount of a suitable acid such as sulfuric acid or<br>
hydrochloric acid. The phenol 7-B is converted to (4-<br>
dimethylthiocarbamoyloxyphenyl) acetic acid methyl ester 7-C by reacting with<br>
dimethylthiocarbamoyl chloride in the presence of some appropriate bases such<br>
as triethylamine and 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine. At high temperature, in the<br>
preferred range of 250 to 300°C, 7-C is rearranged to (4-<br>
dimethylcarbamoylsulfanylphenyl) acetic acid methyl ester 7-D in a high boiling<br>
point solvent such as tetradecane. By treatment with a suitable base such as<br>
sodium methoxide 7-D is transformed to (4-mercaptophenyl) acetic acid methyl<br>
ester 7-E.<br>
Scheme 8. Synthesis of Compound Ib1<br><br><br>
In accordance with Scheme 8, wherein R is alkyl, epoxide 8-B is obtained<br>
by treatment of phenol 2-C with an appropriate base such as cesium carbonate<br>
followed by alkylation with 2-chloromethyl-oxirane 8-A. Epoxide ring opening of<br>
8-B with benzenethiol 7-E, prepared in Scheme 7 above, in the presence of a<br>
catalytic amount of tetrabutylammonium fluoride furnishes alcohol 8-C. Alkyl<br>

D. Formulation and Administration<br>
The present compounds are PPAR delta agonists and are therefore useful<br>
in treating or inhibiting the progression of PPAR delta mediated conditions, such<br>
as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, Metabolic X Syndrome,<br>
hypercholesterolemia, hypo-HDL-cholesterolemia, hyper-LDL-cholesterolemia,<br>
dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, obesity, and complications thereof. For instance,<br>
complications of diabetes include such conditions as neuropathy, nephropathy,<br>
and retinopathy.<br>
The invention features a method for treating a subject with a PPAR delta<br>
mediated disease, said method comprising administering to the subject a<br>
therapeutically effective amount of a pharmaceutical composition comprising a<br>
compound of the invention. The invention also provides a method for treating or<br>
inhibiting the progression of diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance in a subject,<br>
wherein the method comprises administering to the subject a therapeutically<br>
effective amount of a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of the<br>
invention.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may be formulated into various<br>
pharmaceutical forms for administration purposes. To prepare these<br>
pharmaceutical compositions, an effective amount of a particular compound, in<br>
base or acid addition salt form, as the active ingredient is intimately mixed with a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
A carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of<br>
preparation desired for administration. These pharmaceutical compositions are<br>
desirably in unitary dosage form suitable, preferably, for oral administration or<br>
parenteral injection. For example, in preparing the compositions in oral dosage<br>
form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed. These include<br><br>
water, glycols, oils, alcohols and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations<br>
such as suspensions, syrups, elixirs and solutions; or solid carriers such as<br>
starches, sugars, kaolin, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in<br>
the case of powders, pills, capsules and tablets. In view of their ease in<br>
administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral<br>
dosage unit form, in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are generally<br>
employed. For parenteral compositions, the carrier will usually comprise sterile<br>
water, at least in large part, though other ingredients, for example, to aid<br>
solubility, may be included. Injectable solutions, for example, may be prepared<br>
in which the carrier comprises saline solution, glucose solution or a mixture of<br>
saline and glucose solution. Injectable suspensions may also be prepared in<br>
which case appropriate liquid carriers, suspending agents and the like may be<br>
employed. In the compositions suitable for percutaneous administration, the<br>
carrier optionally comprises a penetration enhancing agent and/or a suitable<br>
wetting agent, optionally combined with suitable additives of any nature in minor<br>
proportions, which additives do not cause a significant deleterious effect to the<br>
skin. Such additives may facilitate the administration to the skin and/or may be<br>
helpful for preparing the desired compositions. These compositions may be<br>
administered in various ways, e.g., as a transdermal patch, as a spot-on, as an<br>
ointment. Acid addition salts of the compounds of formula I, due to their<br>
increased water solubility over the corresponding base form, are more suitable in<br>
the preparation of aqueous compositions.<br>
It is especially advantageous to formulate the aforementioned<br>
pharmaceutical compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and<br>
uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used in the specification herein refers<br>
to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages, each unit containing a<br>
predetermined quantity of active ingredient calculated to produce the desired<br>
therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier.<br>
Examples of such dosage unit forms are tablets (including scored or coated<br>
tablets), capsules, pills, powder packets, wafers, injectable solutions or<br><br>
suspensions, teaspoonfuls, tablespoonfuls and the like, and segregated multiples<br>
thereof.<br>
Pharmaceutical^ acceptable acid addition salts include the therapeutically<br>
active non-toxic acid addition salts of disclosed compounds. The latter can<br>
conveniently be obtained by treating the base form with an appropriate acid.<br>
Appropriate acids comprise, for example, inorganic acids such as hydrohalic<br>
acids, e.g. hydrochloric or hydrobromic acid; sulfuric; nitric; phosphoric and the<br>
like acids; or organic acids such as, for example, acetic, propanoic,<br>
hydroxyacetic, lactic, pyruvic, oxalic, malonic, succinic, maleic, fumaric, malic,<br>
tartaric, citric, methanesulfonic, ethanesulfonic, benzenesulfonic, p-<br>
toluenesulfonic, cyclamic, salicylic, p-aminosalicylic, palmoic and the like acids.<br>
The term addition salt also comprises the solvates which the disclosed<br>
compounds, as well as the salts thereof, are able to form. Such solvates are for<br>
example hydrates, alcoholates and the like, Conversely the salt form can be<br>
converted by treatment with alkali into the free base form.<br>
Stereoisomeric forms define all the possible isomeric forms which the<br>
compounds of Formula (I) may possess. Unless otherwise mentioned or<br>
indicated, the chemical designation of compounds denotes the mixture of all<br>
possible stereochemically isomeric forms, said mixtures containing all<br>
diastereomers and enantiomers of the basic molecular structure. More in<br>
particular, stereogenic centers may have the (R)- or (S)-configuration;<br>
substituents on bivalent cyclic saturated radicals may have either the cis- or<br>
trans-configuration. The invention encompasses stereochemically isomeric<br>
forms including diastereoisomers, as well as mixtures thereof in any proportion of<br>
the disclosed compounds. The disclosed compounds may also exist in their<br>
tautomeric forms. Such forms although not explicitly indicated in the above and<br>
following formulae are intended to be included within the scope of the present<br>
invention.<br><br>
Those of skill in the treatment of disorders or conditions mediated by the<br>
PPAR delta could easily determine the effective daily amount from the test<br>
results presented hereinafter and other information. In general it is contemplated<br>
that a therapeutically effective dose would be from 0.001 mg/kg to 5 mg/kg body<br>
weight, more preferably from 0.01 mg/kg to 0.5 mg/kg body weight. It may be<br>
appropriate to administer the therapeutically effective dose as two, three, four or<br>
more sub-doses at appropriate intervals throughout the day. Said sub-doses<br>
may be formulated as unit dosage forms, for example, containing 0.05 mg to 250<br>
mg or 750 mg, and in particular 0.5 to 50 mg of active ingredient per unit dosage<br>
form. Examples include 2 mg, 4 mg, 7 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, 25 mg, and 35 mg<br>
dosage forms. Compounds of the invention may also be prepared in time-<br>
release or subcutaneous or transdermal patch formulations. Disclosed<br>
compound may also be formulated as a spray or other topical or inhalable<br>
formulations.<br>
The exact dosage and frequency of administration depends on the<br>
particular compound of Formula (I) used, the particular condition being treated,<br>
the severity of the condition being treated, the age, weight and general physical<br>
condition of the particular patient as well as other medication the patient may be<br>
taking, as is well known to those skilled in the art. Furthermore, it is evident that<br>
said effective daily amount may be lowered or increased depending on the<br>
response of the treated patient and/or depending on the evaluation of the<br>
physician prescribing the compounds of the instant invention. The effective daily<br>
amount ranges mentioned herein are therefore only guidelines.<br>
The next section includes detailed information relating to the use of the<br>

fibrates.<br>
Methods are known in the art for determining effective doses for<br>
therapeutic and prophylactic purposes for the disclosed pharmaceutical<br>
compositions or the disclosed drug combinations, whether or not formulated in<br>
the same composition. For therapeutic purposes, the term "jointly effective<br>
amount" as used herein, means that amount of each active compound or<br>
. pharmaceutical agent, alone or in combination, that elicits the biological or<br>
medicinal response in a tissue system, animal or human that is being sought by a<br>
researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician, which includes<br>
alleviation of the symptoms of the disease or disorder being treated. For<br>
prophylactic purposes (i.e., inhibiting the onset or progression of a disorder), the<br>
term " "jointly effective amount" refers to that amount of each active compound or<br>
pharmaceutical agent, alone or in combination, that treats or inhibits in a subject<br>
the onset or progression of a disorder as being sought by a researcher,<br>
veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician. Thus, the present invention<br>
provides combinations of two or more drugs wherein, for example, (a) each drug<br>
is administered in an independently therapeutically or prophylactically effective<br>
amount; (b) at least one drug in the combination is administered in an amount<br>
that is sub-therapeutic or sub-prophylactic if administered alone, but is<br>
therapeutic or prophylactic when administered in combination with the second or<br>
additional drugs according to the invention; or (c) both (or more) drugs are<br>
administered in an amount that is sub-therapeutic or sub-prophylactic if<br>
administered alone, but are therapeutic or prophylactic when administered<br>
together.<br><br>
