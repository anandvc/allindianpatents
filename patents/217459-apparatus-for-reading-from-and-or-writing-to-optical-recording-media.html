				<td>Apparatus for reading from and/or writing to optical<br>
recording media<br>
The present invention relates to an apparatus<br>
for reading from and/or writing to optical recording<br>
media which apparatus uses the differential phase<br>
detection method DPD for the purpose of tracking and<br>
has variable delay elements for this purpose.<br>
An apparatus of this type is disclosed in<br>
US-A-4,785,441. In this known apparatus errors in the<br>
tracking signal, the said errors being caused by<br>
tilting of the optical recording medium or by different<br>
pit depths in the optical recording medium, are<br>
compensated for by the delay times of the variable<br>
delay elements being altered on the basis of a phase<br>
comparison carried out during operation.<br>
The known apparatus may be regarded as having<br>
the disadvantage that although errors caused by tilting<br>
of the optical recording medium or by different pit<br>
depths of the optical recording medium can be<br>
compensated for relatively well, the way in which an<br>
error caused by lens displacement is detected is not<br>
optimal. This is due to the fact that error components<br>
are included from other error sources, for example<br>
changes in the component properties which are caused by<br>
ageing or changing ambient conditions. The result of<br>
this is that the compensation is indeed not optimal.<br>
The object of the present invention is to<br>
propose a corresponding apparatus which exhibits the<br>
best possible compensation of the error in the track<br>
error signal and thus in the tracking signal, the said<br>
error being caused on account of the lens movement.<br>
This object is achieved according to the<br>
invention by means of the features specified in<br>
Claim 1. In this case, a portion of the variable delay<br>
elements is arranged between four-quadrant detector and<br>
summation point and designed as analogue delay element.<br>
Another portion of the variable delay elements is of<br>
digital design and arranged between summation point and<br>
phase comparator. The arrangement according to the<br>
invention has the advantage that the offset in the<br>
track error signal caused by lens movement is<br>
compensated for optimally by means of the analogue<br>
delay elements. Both phase and amplitude information of<br>
the respective analogue signal are preserved even after<br>
the delay by means of the analogue delay element and<br>
are available at the summation point. Following the<br>
summation, on the other hand, only the phase<br>
information is critical. In this case, according to the<br>
invention, the compensation of other influences on the<br>
offset is performed by means of digital delay elements.<br>
The advantage of this arrangement is that digital delay<br>
elements can be realized more easily since they delay<br>
only edges in their input signal by defined times.<br>
Likewise, the outlay for the delay elements which<br>
continue to be realized in analogue form is reduced<br>
since their required range of adjustment can be<br>
limited. A theoretical possibility of realizing all of<br>
the delay elements in digital form has proved to be<br>
less suitable in practice since both the temporal<br>
position of the signals with respect to one another and<br>
their amplitudes are important before the summation<br>
point. It has been shown in practice that both the<br>
amplitudes and the temporal behaviour of the four<br>
detector signals may vary in the event of a<br>
displacement of the objective lens from the optical<br>
axis. The compensation of that component of the track<br>
error signal offset which is dependent on lens movement<br>
can be carried out optimally according to the invention<br>
if both measurement variables are present before the<br>
summation and digitization. The amplitude information<br>
is lost, however, if digitization is already effected<br>
before the addition. Lens movement compensation would<br>
no longer be possible in an optimal manner in this<br>
case.  The  arrangement  of  variable  delay  elements<br>
situated upstream and downstream of the summation point<br>
makes it possible, moreover, not only to compensate for<br>
an error caused by lens deflection but also to<br>
compensate for an offset in the track error signal.<br>
Adaptations, for example to undesirable delays caused<br>
by component tolerances or to similar interfering<br>
influences, are also made possible.<br>
According to an advantageous refinement of the<br>
apparatus, the control device has an offset determining<br>
device, at whose input the output signal of the phase<br>
comparator is present and whose output signal serves<br>
for setting the variable delay elements. This has the<br>
advantage that an offset that may be present in the<br>
track error signal is likewise compensated for by the<br>
setting of the delay times of the delay elements. In an<br>
advantageous manner, the track error signal is<br>
integrated for this purpose and the pair of detector<br>
elements to be delayed and also the magnitude of the<br>
required delay are determined from the sign and<br>
absolute value of the output signal of the integrator.<br>
In an advantageous manner, the two error<br>
compensation devices for offset and for errors caused<br>
by lens deflection are combined in order to be able to<br>
generate a track error signal that is as free from<br>
errors as possible.<br>
The arrangement, provided according to the<br>
invention, of at least one of the delay elements<br>
between a summation point for output signals of the<br>
detector elements of the four-quadrant detector and the<br>
phase comparator has the advantage that the offset<br>
compensation is effected with delay elements that are<br>
independent of the compensation of the lens movement.<br>
In this case, the invention provides both solutions<br>
using two variable delay elements and a simple<br>
switching. device and solutions using a single delay<br>
element and a somewhat more complex switching device.<br>
This has the advantage that, depending on the given<br>
boundary conditions, it is possible to realize the most<br>
favourable version in each case in terms of cost or<br>
from the standpoint of production complexity. In<br>
general, solutions using a small number of delay<br>
elements are preferable here since they occupy a small<br>
chip area in case of realization as an integrated<br>
circuit.<br>
A possibility of managing with just two<br>
analogue variable delay elements as afforded by the<br>
invention consists in connecting the said delay<br>
elements by means of a switching device in each case to<br>
the detector elements whose signals are to be delayed.<br>
This has the advantage that the number of delay<br>
elements is reduced in this case, too.<br>
According to the invention, an artificial<br>
interference signal is fed to the tracking device, the<br>
track error signal caused as a result of this is<br>
compared with the interference signal and the result is<br>
fed to the control device. This has the advantage that<br>
errors in the track error signal which are caused by<br>
lens deflection can be optimally compensated for. The<br>
interference signal generating device effects a<br>
deflection of the lens and thus an error in the track<br>
error signal, the output signal of the phase<br>
comparator. This error is not compensated for as long<br>
as the tracking regulating circuit is not closed. Thus,<br>
an error caused by the lens deflection initially<br>
manifests itself without any compensation in the track<br>
error signal. By means of the control device, the<br>
interference signal and the track error signal are<br>
compared and the delay times of the variable delay<br>
elements are set optimally by means of the result of<br>
this comparison. This means that after the setting the<br>
interference signal has no residual influence, or only<br>
a very weak one, remaining in the track error signal.<br>
The control device advantageously has a<br>
comparison device, at whose inputs the output signal of<br>
the phase comparator and the output signal of the<br>
interference signal generating device are present, the<br>
output signal of the comparison device serving for<br>
setting the variable delay elements. This has the<br>
advantage that the comparison device provides both a<br>
direction signal, which specifies whether the delay to<br>
be set has to be positive or negative, or which pair of<br>
detector elements is to be delayed, and an absolute<br>
value signal, which specifies the magnitude of the<br>
required delay. The comparison device advantageously<br>
has a synchronous demodulator.<br>
The invention furthermore provides for an<br>
output signal of the control device to be decomposed<br>
into absolute value and sign by means of a circuit<br>
block. This has the advantage that for example the sign<br>
signal can be used directly for driving a switching<br>
device, which thus receives a quasi-digital drive<br>
signal of defined amplitude. Furthermore, sign<br>
determination e.g. in the case of the delay elements is<br>
thereby rendered unnecessary.<br>
According to the invention, a comparator, also<br>
referred to as converter below, is connected upstream<br>
of the digital delay element or elements. The said<br>
comparator converts its analogue input signal, which is<br>
defined only within wide limits in terms of zero point<br>
and amplitude, into an output signal which assumes just<br>
two states and has relatively sharply defined<br>
transitions between these states. In this case, the<br>
comparison value of the comparator may assume a<br>
predetermined value or be tracked adaptively. The<br>
digitized signal can be processed particularly well by<br>
digital delay elements. The converter is also often<br>
referred to as "slicer".<br>
An advantageous refinement of the invention<br>
provides for the delay elements and the control device<br>
to be realized on an "integrated circuit. One advantage<br>
of the arrangement according to the invention is that<br>
inexpensive realizability is possible in case of<br>
integration in an integrated circuit since digital<br>
delay elements take up a relatively small chip area<br>
and, consequently, a low price is possible. A further<br>
advantage resides in the fact that the delay elements<br>
used are relatively small and less dependent on<br>
manufacturing tolerances of the integrated circuit.<br>
It is understood that the invention is not<br>
restricted to the concretely specified exemplary<br>
embodiments and alternatives but rather includes all<br>
developments which are within the ability of the person<br>
skilled in the art. Further advantages and also<br>

Figure 1 shows an apparatus according to the<br>
invention. A tracking device 13 is illustrated on the<br>
left-hand side, an objective lens 3 and a vernier<br>
drive 6 belonging to the said tracking device. The<br>
vernier drive 6 is driven by the tracking regulator 17,<br>
at whose input the track error signal DPD-TE output by<br>
a phase detector 14 is present. On the other hand, an<br>
interference signal S is applied to the vernier drive 6<br>
by an interference signal generating device 22. The<br>
interference signal S is phase-shifted to form the<br>
signal WSY by means of a phase shifter 23 and fed to a<br>
control device 24. The control device 24 evaluates the<br>
signal WSY and the track error signal DPD-TE and sets<br>
the delay times ts, tT, tx and tY of the variable delay<br>
elements 26S, 26T, 26X, 26Y via switching<br>
devices 25, 37. The variable analogue delay<br>
elements 26X, 26Y delay the signals output by the<br>
detector elements A and B and respectively C and D of<br>
the four-quadrant detector 5 by the respectively set<br>
delay times tx, ty. The signals of the detector<br>
elements A and C, one of which is delayed, are summed<br>
at a first summation point 15 and forwarded to the<br>
phase detector 14. The same applies correspondingly to<br>
the summation point 16 and the signals of the detector<br>
elements B and D, one of which is likewise delayed.<br>
The DPD tracking method will now be explained<br>
with reference to Figure 2. Figure 2 shows, in a<br>
diagrammatic illustration, a known apparatus which<br>
utilizes the DPD tracking method. A light source 1 •<br>
generates a light beam which is focused onto an optical<br>
recording medium 4 by means of a semi-transparent<br>
mirror 2, which is illustrated as part of a polarizing<br>
beam splitter, and an objective lens 3. The light beam<br>
is reflected from the said optical recording medium and<br>
directed onto a four-quadrant detector 5. The four-<br>
quadrant detector 5 is shown tilted by 90°, that is to<br>
say in plan view, and comprises four detector elements<br>
A, B, C and D. Arrow 10 indicates the track direction,<br>
that is to say the direction in which the recording<br>
medium 4 moves relative to the four-quadrant<br>
detector 5. The four-quadrant detector 5 can thus be<br>
divided into two detector areas which are situated<br>
laterally with respect to the track direction and<br>
comprise the detector elements A and B, on the one hand<br>
and also C and D, on the other hand.<br>
A collimator 7 is arranged between light<br>
source 1 and mirror 2, and a convex lens 8 is arranged<br>
between mirror 2 and the four-quadrant detector 5. A<br>
vernier drive 6 moves the objective lens 3 in the<br>
radial direction with regard to the optical recording<br>
medium 4 in accordance with a vernier drive actuating<br>
signal TS. Objective lens 3 and vernier drive 6 are<br>
part of the tracking device 13. The recording medium 4<br>
is designed as a disc, for example corresponding to an<br>
audio compact disc (CD) , a video disc, a recording<br>
medium having a high recording density (DVD) or the<br>
like. The optical recording medium 4 is made to rotate<br>
by means of a disc drive 9 (indicated only<br>
diagrammatically here). A section through the recording<br>
medium 4 along a diameter is illustrated. The light<br>
beam focused onto the recording medium 4 by the<br>
objective lens 3 is situated in the radially outer area<br>
of the recording medium 4. The displacement direction<br>
of the beam reflected from the optical recording<br>
medium 4, after passing" through the objective lens 3<br>
which is caused by the displacement of the objective<br>
lens 3 effected by the vernier drive 6, is indicated by<br>
the arrows 12. Arrow 11 represents the direction of<br>
movement of the lens 3.<br>
The outputs of the detector elements A and C<br>
are connected to a first summation point 15, and the<br>
outputs of the detector elements B and D are connected<br>
to a second summation point 16. The corresponding<br>
summation signals A+C and B+D, respectively, are<br>
forwarded to a phase detector 14, at whose output a<br>
track error signal DPD-TE determined according to the<br>
DPD method is present.<br>
The outputs of the summation points 15 and 16<br>
are connected to the inputs of a further summation<br>
point 18. Thus, the sum of the signals of all the<br>
detector elements A, B, C and D is present at the<br>
output of the summation point 18. This signal is the<br>
information signal HF, which is passed on to an<br>
evaluation unit (not illustrated here) for conversion<br>
into signals that can be evaluated for the user.<br>
In order to describe the functioning of the<br>
apparatus according to the invention, reference shall<br>
initially be made to Figure 1. The structure of the<br>
phase detector 14 is elucidated diagrammatically here.<br>
The phase detector has the converters 19, 19", a phase<br>
comparator 20 and a low-pass filter 21. In the<br>
configuration according to the invention as shown in<br>
Figure 1, the variable digital delay elements 26S, 26T<br>
are arranged between converter 19, 19" and phase<br>
comparator 20, the said delay elements not usually<br>
being regarded as part of a phase detector. Situated at<br>
the inputs of the phase detector 14 is a respective<br>
converter 19 and 19", whose outputs are connected to<br>
the inputs of a phase comparator 20, via the delay<br>
elements 2 6S, 2 6T in the exemplary embodiment. The<br>
output of the phase comparator 20 is connected to the<br>
output of the phase detector 14 via a low-pass<br>
filter 21, at which output the track error<br>
signal DPD-TE determined by means of the DPD method is<br>
present.<br>
The signals of the detector elements A and C<br>
are added at the summation point 15, and the summation<br>
signal is brought to logic level in the converter 19,<br>
which acts as a zero crossing comparator. A<br>
corresponding digitized summation signal B+D is formed<br>
by means of the summation point 16 and the<br>
converter 19". These two signals pass through a<br>
respective delay element 26S, 26T and are fed to the<br>
phase comparator 20, which evaluates the relative time<br>
interval between the edges of the two signals. The<br>
track error signal DPD-TE is the average value of these<br>
time differences and is formed by the low-pass<br>
filter 21. If the scanning point or spot 29, as<br>
explained below with reference to Figure 3, follows the<br>
track centre 30 exactly, then the zero crossings of the<br>
summation signals A+c and B+D take place simultaneously<br>
and the resultant track error is zero. If the spot 29<br>
follows the track with a constant deviation with<br>
respect to the track centre, then the zero crossing of<br>
these summation signals no longer occurs simultaneously<br>
but rather in a manner shifted temporally with respect<br>
to one another. The time difference that occurs is on<br>
average approximately proportional to the scanning<br>
deviation with respect to the track centre, where the<br>
time difference, referring to one of the signals, may<br>
be positive or negative. In other words, the sign of<br>
the time difference comprises the direction and the<br>
absolute value, on the other hand, the magnitude of the<br>
deviation.<br>
In Figure 1, the static offset adjustment is<br>
effected by the delay elements 26S, 26T, and that is to<br>
say downstream of the summation points 15, 16. A<br>
switching device 25 is switched in dependence on the<br>
signal SIGN (B) and causes the signal ABS (B) to be fed<br>
to one of the digital delay elements 26S, 26T. The<br>
delay elements 26S, 26T can "thus be connected to the<br>
output signal VBS of the offset determining device 44<br>
by means of the switching device 25. It lies within the<br>
scope of the invention to provide a digital delay<br>
element having a  fixed delay time and a variable<br>
digital delay element instead of two variable delay<br>
elements 26S, 26T at this point, the delay time of the<br>
said variable digital delay element being shortened or<br>
lengthened in comparison with the fixed delay time of<br>
the other delay element in dependence on the<br>
signal VBS.<br>
Two variable analogue delay elements 26X<br>
and 2 6Y, which can be connected either to the detector<br>
elements A and B or to the detector elements C and D by<br>
means of a switching device 37, are provided for the<br>
purpose of adjusting the error caused by lens movement.<br>
This ensures that either the signals of one pair A-B or<br>
those of the other pair C-D are delayed relative to the<br>
respective other pair. The switching device 37 is<br>
switched by means of the signal SIGN (A) , and the<br>
signal ABS (A) is applied to the delay<br>
elements 26X, 26Y.<br>
In its upper part, Figure 3 shows a<br>
diagrammatic, greatly enlarged detail of the<br>
information layer of the optical recording medium 4 in<br>
plan view. Three tracks lying next to one another are<br>
evident, of which two or three of the depressions, the<br>
so-called pits 28, that form them and are extended in<br>
elongate fashion in the track direction are<br>
illustrated. The distances between the pits 28 in the<br>
track direction as well as the length of the pits in<br>
the track direction (arrow 10) can differ within<br>
specific limits from the conditions shown here. This<br>
depends on the modulation method used for converting<br>
the information to be stored into the pit pattern and<br>
on the content of the recorded information. In<br>
particular, the pits 28 can have different lengths.<br>
A four-quadrant detector 5, which is situated<br>
symmetrically with respect to the track centre 30 of<br>
the central track and comprises the detector elements<br>
A, B, C and D, is indicated to the left of the pits 28.<br>
This serves to illustrate how the output signals of the<br>
detector areas A, B, C and D behave when the light<br>
spot 29 falling onto the information layer is displaced<br>
from the track centre 30.<br>
In the lower region of Figure 3, the amplitudes<br>
of a number of combinations of the output signals of<br>
the detector areas A, B, C and D are plotted<br>
diagrammatically against the time axis t, where the<br>
time axis t corresponds to the space axis in the track<br>
direction in the event of a movement of spot 29 and<br>
optical recording medium in the track direction<br>
(arrow 10) relative to one another at a normal read-out<br>
speed. In the following text, for the sake of<br>
simplicity, the signals of the detector areas A, B,<br>
C, D and signals derived therefrom are in some<br>
instances also designated by the letters of the<br>
detector elements.<br>
The curve 31 illustrated directly below the<br>
pits 28 diagrammatically shows the information<br>
signal HF, that is to say the sum of the signals of all<br>
the detector elements A, B, C and D. As long as the<br>
spot 29 does not impinge on any of the pits 28, the<br>
amplitude of the information signal HF is large. As<br>
soon as the spot 29 moves onto one of the pits 28, the<br>
amplitude decreases as a consequence of destructive<br>
interference, changed reflectivity or on account of<br>
another suitable effect, and reaches a minimum as soon<br>
as maximum overlapping of spot 29 and pit 28 is<br>
reached.<br>
The curves 32 show a combination of the already<br>
digitized signals A+C and B+D without track errors,<br>
that is to say when the spot 29 is centred with respect<br>
to the track centre 30 or when there is no deflection<br>
of the objective lens 3. The curves 32" (dotted) and<br>
the curves 32"" (dashed) respectively show the temporal<br>
shift of the summation signals A+C and B+D "in<br>
dependence on the lens displacement or the deviation of<br>
the spot 29" and of the spot 29", respectively, from<br>
the track centre 30 in the direction of the displaced<br>
scanning track 30" and 30"" respectively. Since both a<br>
deviation from the track centre and a lens displacement<br>
leads to the same result in the digital summation<br>
signal, the two dependencies cannot be separated. The<br>
temporal shift At of the signals A+C and B+D with<br>
respect to one another corresponds, in terms of its<br>
absolute value, to the magnitude of the deviation of<br>
the displaced scanning track 30". 30"" from the track<br>
centre 30 and, in terms of its sign, to the direction<br>
of the corresponding deviation. The phase detector 14<br>
determines the track error signal DPD-TE therefrom - as<br>
described above.<br>
It may be noted that, depending on the optical<br>
construction the signals of the detector areas A, B, C<br>
and D may already have temporally static shifts with<br>
respect to one another in the absence of track<br>
deviation or lens deflection. However, the shifts<br>
of B+D in comparison with A+C which are shown in the<br>
curves 32" and 32"" are typical in case of lens<br>
deflection or deviation from the track centre.<br>
Since the objective lens 3 has to be able to<br>
move in the horizontal direction, that is to say<br>
perpendicularly to the direction of the tracks of the<br>
recording medium 4, drifting of the reflective imaging<br>
of the disc information surface on the four-quadrant<br>
detector 5 is likewise produced in the event of<br>
deflection in the horizontal direction on account of<br>
the beam geometry. It is therefore a particular<br>
property of the DPD tracking method that as a result of<br>
these time differences on account of the lens movement<br>
a track error signal DPD-TE arises which is not zero<br>
even if the spot 29 follows the track centre 30<br>
exactly.<br>
Subjecting the signal of one or more detector<br>
elements A, B, C and D to a time delay in a targeted<br>
manner before their addition at the summation points 15<br>
and 16, respectively, makes it possible to achieve<br>
compensation of the offset in the track error<br>
signal DPD-TE, the said offset being caused on account<br>
of the lens movement. The apparatus according to the<br>
invention and also the method according to the<br>
invention make it possible, as a result of the<br>
adjustment of the delay times tx, tY of the variable<br>
delay elements 26X, 26Y, to achieve the best possible<br>
compensation of this offset on account of the lens<br>
movement and also, in combination with the variable<br>
delay times of the digital delay elements, the best<br>
possible compensation of offsets which are based on<br>
other influences.<br>
In its upper part, Figure 10 shows the<br>
amplitude characteristic and the phase of the signals<br>
of the detector elements A, B, C and D and also of the<br>
summation signals A+D and B+D using the example of a<br>
so-called 3T signal without any deflection of the<br>
objective lens relative to the track and without a<br>
delay being set. The 3T signal corresponds to a short<br>
pit 28. The horizontal axes in Figure 10 correspond to<br>
the respective zero lines, and a vertical dotted axis<br>
is indicated every 5 units in order to afford better<br>
orientation. The signals illustrated have the same<br>
amplitude; therefore, the zero crossing of the<br>
respective summation signals A+C and B+D lies in the<br>
centre between the zero crossings of the individual<br>
signals A and C and respectively B and D. The phase<br>
between the summation signals A+C and B+D is zero.<br>
In its lower part, Figure 10 shows the<br>
amplitude characteristic and the phase of the detector<br>
signals A, B, C and D using the example of a 3T signal<br>
without any lens movement but with compensation by<br>
means of delay. As a result of the delay, the two<br>
signals A and B are shifted by approximately 1.2 units<br>
to the right in comparison with the upper part of<br>
Figure 10. Since the signals have the same amplitude,<br>
the zero crossing of the respective summation<br>
signals A+C and B+D lies in the centre between the zero<br>
crossings of the individual signals. The phase between<br>
the  summation  signals  is  again  zero.  Thus,  the<br>
compensation does not interfere with the phase without<br>
lens deflection.<br>
In its upper part, Figure 11 shows the<br>
amplitude characteristic and the phase of the detector<br>
signals A, B, C and D using the example of a 3T signal<br>
with lens movement but without compensation by means of<br>
delay. Figure 11 corresponds to Figure 10 in terms of<br>
its structure. On account of the lens movement, by way<br>
of example the zero crossings of the signal A are<br>
shifted to the right, and those of the signal B to the<br>
left, in comparison with the upper part of Figure 10.<br>
Since the signals A and C and also B and D have<br>
different amplitudes, the zero crossings of the<br>
respective summation signals A+C and B+D no longer lie<br>
in the centre between the zero crossings of the<br>
individual signals. Likewise, the phase difference<br>
between the summation signals is no longer zero but<br>
rather is approximately one unit in the example<br>
illustrated.<br>
The lower part of Figure 11 shows the amplitude<br>
characteristic and the phase of the detector signals A,<br>
B, C and D using the example of a 3T signal with lens<br>
movement and, in contrast to the upper part, with<br>
compensation by means of delay. The effect of the delay<br>
is that the two signals A and B are shifted by<br>
approximately 1.2 units to the right in comparison with<br>
the upper part of Figure 11. On account of the lens<br>
movement, by way of example, the zero crossings of the<br>
signals A are shifted to the right and B to the left,<br>
this being so both in comparison with the upper part of<br>
Figure 10 and with that of Figure 11. The individual<br>
signals have different amplitudes; therefore, the zero<br>
crossings of the respective summation signals A+C<br>
and B+D no longer lie in the centre between the zero<br>
crossings of the individual signals. As a result of the<br>
compensation, however the phase difference between the<br>
summation signals is zero.<br>
Figure 12 shows the amplitude characteristic<br>
and the phase of the detector signals A, B, C and D<br>
using the example of a 3T signal with the opposite<br>
direction of lens movement to that of Figure 11. The<br>
case without compensation by means of delay is<br>
illustrated in the upper part. On account of the lens<br>
movement in the other direction, by way of example the<br>
zero crossings of the signal A are shifted to the left,<br>
and those of the signal B to the right, in comparison<br>
with Figure 10. When a displacement of the objective<br>
lens occurs, the signals also have a changed amplitude<br>
in addition to their phase shift. The said amplitude is<br>
different for the individual signals, for which reason<br>
the zero crossings of the respective summation<br>
signals A+C and B+D no longer lie in the centre between<br>
the zero crossings of the individual signals. Likewise,<br>
the phase between the summation signals is no longer<br>
zero but rather, in the example illustrated, is<br>
approximately one unit in the direction other than that<br>
in Figure 11.<br>
The corresponding signals with compensation by<br>
means of delay are illustrated in the lower part of<br>
Figure 12. On account of the delay, the two signals A<br>
and B are shifted by approximately 1.2 units to the<br>
right in comparison with the upper part of the Figure.<br>
On account of the lens movement in the other direction,<br>
by way of example the zero crossings of the signals A<br>
are shifted to the left and B to the right in<br>
comparison with the upper part of Figure 10, as in the<br>
upper part of Figure 12. Since the signals have<br>
different amplitudes, the zero crossings of the<br>
respective summation signals A+C and B+D no longer lie<br>
in the centre between the zero crossings of the<br>
individual signals. As a result of the compensation,<br>
however, the phase difference between the summation<br>
signals is again zero in this case, too.<br>
In the examples specified in Figures 10-12, a<br>
displacement of the light spot on the detector in the<br>
direction of the half of the detector elements B and C,<br>
in the case of which the signals B and C become larger<br>
and the signals A and D become smaller, is accompanied<br>
by a temporal shift of the zero crossing of the<br>
signal A to the right and of the signal B to the left.<br>
In the case of an opposite direction of movement of the<br>
light spot, the signals A and D become larger and the<br>
signals B and C, on the other hand, become smaller. The<br>
temporal shift of the signals A and B is likewise<br>
reversed.<br>
The example specified constitutes just one of<br>
the possible behaviours of the individual detector<br>
signals with respect to one another; other combinations<br>
such as opposite temporal behaviour given the same<br>
displacement direction as specified in the example,<br>
effect of the temporal shift on the signals C and D<br>
instead of on the signals A and B, and others likewise<br>
occur. This depends on the construction and the<br>
tolerances of the optical system as well as the optical<br>
properties of the recording media to be played back.<br>
As is evident from Figures 10 to 12, the delay<br>
of the respectively larger signal, the signal B in the<br>
upper part of Figures 11 and 12, effects a greater<br>
shift of the zero crossing of the sum B+D than the same<br>
delay of the smaller signal, in this case the signal A<br>
for example, with regard to the sum A+C, even though<br>
the absolute value of the shift is the same for both<br>
signals A and B. If the amplitude information were no<br>
longer available at the point of summation, then<br>
correct compensation could no longer be achieved since<br>
the interaction between amplitude and phase would be<br>
lost. The invention therefore provides an analogue<br>
delay before the summation.<br>
The functioning of one exemplary embodiment of<br>
an apparatus according to the invention will now be<br>
described with reference to Figure 1. As a result of<br>
the movement of the objective lens 3 parallel to the<br>
surface of the recording medium 4 perpendicularly to<br>
the track direction, that is to say in the direction of<br>
the arrow 11, an offset is formed in the track error<br>
signal DPD-TE. In accordance with one variant of the<br>
invention, the vernier drive 6 is driven by means of a<br>
sinusoidal interference signal S from the interference<br>
signal generating device 22. As a result, the objective<br>
lens 3 is moved about its mechanical zero position by a<br>
certain mechanical excursion; this is also referred to<br>
as the objective lens 3 being wobbled. The drive<br>
frequency is freely selectable within certain limits in<br>
this case. Approximately 2-10 Hz are expedient since<br>
the measurement time or integration time, as described<br>
in more detail below with regard to the control<br>
device 24, becomes too long if the frequency is too<br>
slow, and the natural resonance, not specified exactly,<br>
of the tracking device is approached if the frequency<br>
is too high. If the objective lens 3 is then deflected,<br>
modulation of the envelope of the track error<br>
signal DPD-TE occurs in the event of incorrect setting<br>
of the delay times tx and tY, respectively, of the<br>
analogue delay elements 2 6X and 2 6Y.<br>
The tracking device 22 follows the excitation<br>
by the interference signal S with a time delay. A low-<br>
pass filter 27 with a low cut-off frequency is used to<br>
determine the modulation of the track error<br>
signal DPD-TE. Therefore, the zero crossings of the<br>
modulation on the low-frequency component, used for the<br>
evaluation, of the track error signal, of the signal<br>
TELP, are temporally shifted with respect to the zero<br>
crossings of the interference signal S. This phase<br>
shift is compensated for by means of the phase<br>
shifter 23, whose phase shift is selected such that it<br>
corresponds to the phase shift caused by the tracking<br>
device 13 and the low-pass filter 27. At the output of<br>
the phase shifter 23, a ph-ase-shif ted interference<br>
signal WSY is obtained which is also referred to below<br>
as wobble synchronization signal, which is synchronous<br>
with the modulation of the signal TELP, of the low-<br>
frequency component of the track error signal DPD-TE.<br>
The delay times ts, tT, tx and tY of the delay<br>
elements 26S, 26T, 26X and 26Y, respectively, are set<br>
under the control of the control device 24. For this<br>
purpose, the control device 24 has an offset<br>
determining device 44 and a comparison device 45. The<br>
latter contains, in the exemplary embodiment, a<br>
differential sample-and-hold circuit DSH, a synchronous<br>
demodulator 33, a first window comparator 34 and a<br>
sample-and-hold circuit 35. This is followed by a first<br>
circuit block 36.<br>
The signal WSY and the output signal TELP of<br>
the low-pass filter 27 are fed to a synchronous<br>
demodulator 33, which forms the absolute value from the<br>
modulation of the signal TELP and integrates it. If the<br>
modulation of the signal TELP and the wobble<br>
synchronization signal WSY are in phase, then the<br>
output voltage VA rises; if these signals are in<br>
antiphase, then the output voltage VA of the<br>
synchronous demodulator 33 falls. The output voltage VA<br>
is fed, on the one hand, to a first sample-and-hold<br>
circuit 35 and, on the other hand, to a differential<br>
sample-and-hold circuit DSH, which produces a voltage<br>
VD which is proportional to the temporal change of the<br>
voltage VA. The voltage VD thus differs from zero when<br>
the output voltage VA of the synchronous demodulator 33<br>
changes with respect to time. It is equal to zero when<br>
the output voltage VA no longer changes with respect to<br>
time. This can be ascertained with the aid of a window<br>
comparator 34 to which the comparison voltages ±VRD are<br>
applied, which may be fixedly predetermined or else,<br>
advantageously, may be adaptively matched. The output<br>
signal NMT of the said window comparator thus indicates<br>
when the track error signal DPD-TE no longer has<br>
modulation which is synchronous with the frequency of<br>
the interference signal S.<br>
The sample-and-hold circuit 35 is firstly<br>
switched to sample, that is to say "follow voltage",<br>
VAS = VA, by a control signal S/Hl which is emitted by<br>
a controller (not illustrated). The output voltage VAS<br>
of the sample-and-hold circuit 35 is fed to a circuit<br>
block 36, which forms the absolute value ABS(A) and the<br>
sign SIGN (A) from the output voltage VAS. The sign<br>
SIGN(A) determines the pair of detector elements A and<br>
B or C and D to which the variable analogue delay<br>
elements 26X and 26Y are assigned, the delay times of<br>
which are determined by the absolute value ABS (A) of<br>
the output voltage VAS. To that end switching device 37<br>
is controlled by the sign signal SIGN(A). The circuit<br>
functions described thus enable the delay time tx, tY of<br>
a pair of detector elements A and B or C and D to be<br>
adjusted in such a way that the lens movement-dependent<br>
modulation of the track error signal DPD-TE is<br>
compensated for. Since the delay elements 26X, 26Y are<br>
analogue components, they do not significantly<br>
influence the signal waveform of the signals which they<br>
delay,. with the result that these are also still<br>
available during the summation with the respective<br>
undelayed signal at the summation point 15, 16. This<br>
greatly influences the adjustment accuracy that can be<br>
attained.<br>
If this has been done, the voltage VAS is held<br>
by the first sample-and-hold circuit 35. There now<br>
remains only a constant offset in the track error<br>
signal DPD-TE, which can be compensated for by<br>
adjusting the delay times of the delay<br>
elements 26S, 26T. This offset adjustment is<br>
implemented with the aid of the offset determining<br>
device 44, which has an integrator 39, a window<br>
comparator 40 and a sample-and-hold circuit 41. The<br>
output thereof is followed by a second circuit block 42<br>
in the exemplary embodiment.<br>
For the purpose of offset adjustment, an<br>
integrator 39 and a second window comparator 40 are<br>
connected to the output of the low-pass filter 27. The<br>
second window. comparator 40 determines whether the<br>
filtered track error signal TELP has a DC voltage<br>
offset that is sufficiently small. Since this is<br>
normally not the case after the 1st adjustment step,<br>
the lens movement compensation for the track error<br>
signal DPD-TE, the output voltage VB of the integrator<br>
39 will change. A second sample-and-hold circuit 41, at<br>
whose input the output voltage VB is present, is<br>
firstly switched to sample. The output voltage VBS of<br>
the sample-and-hold circuit 41 therefore follows the<br>
voltage VB. The second circuit block 42 determines<br>
absolute value ABS(B) and sign SIGN(B) from the output<br>
voltage VBS. The sign SIGN(B) controls, via a switching<br>
device 25, for which of the digital delay elements<br>
26S, 2 6T a delay time is set which" is changed in<br>
accordance with the absolute value ABS(B) of the<br>
voltage VB or VBS. The voltage VB and thus the delay<br>
set for the delay element 26S or 26T therefore rise<br>
until the voltage TELP at the input of the integrator<br>
39 becomes zero, that is to say the input voltage at<br>
the second window comparator 40 becomes smaller than<br>
the comparison voltage ±VRTE applied to the latter.<br>
This ensures that the offset voltage which is<br>
superposed on the track error signal DPD-TE is<br>
virtually zero. The last, that is to say optimum value<br>
of the voltage VB is then held in response to a<br>
corresponding signal S/H2 of the controller (not<br>
illustrated) to a corresponding signal NDT, as voltage<br>
VBS by the second sample-and-hold circuit 41. The<br>
adjustment is thus ended. The interference signal S is<br>
now switched off and the tracking regulator 17 is<br>
switched on. The voltages VAS and VBS are held until a<br>
new"adjustment is initiated.<br>
Figure. 4 shows, by way of example, a flow<br>
diagram according to which adjustment of an apparatus<br>
according to the invention in the abovementioned steps<br>
can take place.<br>
After the start of the method in step 50, in<br>
step 51 the tracking regulator 17 is switched off and<br>
the interference signal generating device 22 is<br>
switched on. As a result, the objective lens is wobbled<br>
in the manner described above. In step 52, the delay<br>
times ts, tt, tu,tx and tY of the delay elements 26S, 26T,<br>
26U, 26X and 26Y are reset to an initial value,<br>
generally to zero. In order to form the track error<br>
signal DPD-TE, according to step 53 use is made of the<br>
time between the signals (A+C) and (B+D) which are<br>
output from the summation points 15 and 16, are formed<br>
from the output signals of the detector elements A, B,C<br>
and D, which output signals are routed via the delay<br>
elements 26X, 26Y and, for their part are delayed, if<br>
appropriate by delay element 26S, 26T, 26U. In step 54,<br>
the modulation of the track error signal DPD-TE which<br>
is caused by the interference signal S is detected with<br>
the aid of the synchronous demodulator 33. In step 55,<br>
branching to step 56 takes place if the differential<br>
sample-and-hold circuit DSH still detects changes in<br>
the signal VA, that is to say if VA ? const. If there<br>
is no longer a change in the signal VA, then the method<br>
branches to step 57.<br>
In step 56, the direction of the change, that<br>
is to say the fact of whether the modulation of the<br>
track error signal DPD-TE is in phase or in antiphase<br>
with the interference signal S, determines whether the<br>
method branches to step 58 or to step 59. In step 58,<br>
the delay elements 26X and 26Y are assigned to the<br>
detector areas C and D and their delay time is<br>
increased. In step 59, the delay elements 26X, 26Y are<br>
assigned to the detector areas A, B and their delay<br>
times tx and tY are increased. After steps 58 and 59,<br>
step 54 is carried out anew. This loop is passed<br>
through until the delay times that are set suffice to<br>
compensate for the modulation in the track error signal<br>
DPD-TE. In this case, the loop that has been described<br>
acts like an integration.  If there is no longer a<br>
change in the output voltage VA of the synchronous<br>
demodulator 33, according to step 55 the method<br>
branches to step 57 and thus to the offset<br>
compensation. In the case of each reiteration of the<br>
loop during an adjustment operation, the branching of<br>
step 56 always takes place identically since the sign<br>
of VA does not change but rather only the absolute<br>
value of VA.<br>
In step 57, the set values tx, tY are stored. In<br>
step 57, furthermore, the DC voltage offset is<br>
determined by means of the low-pass filter 27 and the<br>
second window comparator 40. If the DC voltage offset<br>
differs from zero, that is to say if TELP ? 0, then the<br>
method branches to step 61. If the DC voltage offset is<br>
equal to zero within the bounds of predetermined<br>
limits, the comparison voltages ±VRTE in the exemplary<br>
embodiment, then the method branches to step 62. In<br>
step 61, the polarity of the DC voltage offset, that is<br>
to say the sign of the signal TELP, determines the<br>
signal of which of the detector elements is<br>
additionally delayed. If TELP 
branches to step 63, otherwise to step 64. In step 63,<br>
an additional delay of the delay element 26T is<br>
performed in that a value corresponding to the signal<br>
ABS (B) is set for the delay time tT. In step 64, an<br>
additional delay of the delay element 26S is performed<br>
in that a value corresponding to the signal ABS (B) is<br>
set for the delay time t3 After steps 63 and 64, step<br>
60 is carried out anew.. This loop is passed through<br>
until increasing the delay times of the delay elements<br>
26S or 26T has caused the DC voltage offset to be<br>
smaller than the comparison voltage ±VRTE of the window<br>
comparator 40. Repeated traversal of this" loop and<br>
simultaneous incrementation acts like an integration in<br>
this case.<br>
According to step 62, the delay times ts, tt, tu,<br>
tx and ty that have been determined and set are stored<br>
and  held.  These  stored  values  are  the  optimal<br>
compensation values. The method is therefore ended in<br>
step 65.<br>
The flow diagram represented in Figure 4 can be<br>
realized for example by a logic control in accordance<br>
with Figure 5 in connection with the block diagram of<br>
an apparatus according to the invention that is<br>
represented in Figure 1. In this case, the logic AND<br>
gates are denoted by AND, the logic OR gates by OR and<br>
negation elements by N or NOT, and numerical details<br>
relate to the number of respective inputs. Separate<br>
reference symbols are assigned only when necessary.<br>
As a result of the signal START, the adjustment<br>
operation is started and the objective lens 3 is<br>
wobbled. Since modulation of the track error signal<br>
DPD-TE is normally present on account of lens movement,<br>
the signal NMT is at the logic level "low", with the<br>
result that the signal edge of the signal START<br>
switches the first sample-and-hold circuit 35 to<br>
"sample" by means of the signal S/Hl output by the<br>
first digital flip-flop 71. The second digital flip-<br>
flop 72 is reset by NMT = "low", and the reset signal<br>
IRE for the integrator 39 is maintained for the DC<br>
voltage offset compensation. The start pulse for the<br>
second digital flip-flop 72 is likewise suppressed. The<br>
activation of the first sample-and-hold circuit 35<br>
makes it possible for the first adjustment step to<br>
proceed automatically, since the integrating component<br>
is already contained in the synchronous demodulator 33.<br>
The procedure of the first step ends when the voltage<br>
VA no longer changes with respect to time and,<br>
conseguently, the voltage VD returns to the value zero.<br>
The first adjustment step is automatically<br>
avoided if the signal NMT is at logic level "high" from<br>
the beginning, that is to say the modulation of the<br>
track error signal DPD-TE is sufficiently small even<br>
without any delay of the output signals of the detector<br>
elements A and B or C and D. The output NMT of the<br>
window comparator 34 switches to "high", as a result of<br>
which the first digital flip-flop 71 is reset and the<br>
second digital flip-flop 72 is set. At the same time,<br>
the sample-and-hold circuit 35 is switched to "hold"<br>
and the voltage VAS for compensation of the modulation<br>
of the track error signal DPD-TE is stored. At the same<br>
time, the sample-and-hold circuit 41 is switched to<br>
"sample" and the integrator 39 is enabled via the<br>
signal IRE = "low". The second adjustment likewise<br>
proceeds automatically, owing to the integration, until<br>
the signal NDT assumes logic level "high".<br>
As a result, the DC offset in the track error<br>
signal DPD-TE is also compensated for and the end of<br>
the adjustment is reached. If the DC offset is already<br>
equal to zero after the 1st adjustment step, then the<br>
signal NDT already assumes level "high" at this point<br>
in time and the second step is skipped. The signal ADF<br>
outwardly indicates that the adjustment has been<br>
successfully effected and both modulation and offset<br>
are zero or are below a predetermined limit value. With<br>
the aid of the signal HOLDALL both sample-and-hold<br>
circuits 35, 41 can forcibly be held in the state HOLD,<br>
in order to store the voltages for the delay elements<br>
26.<br>
The sequence of the adjustment in accordance<br>
with Figure 5 is illustrated with the aid of a signal<br>
diagram in Figure 6. The individual signals are<br>
designated in the same way as for Figures 1 and 5, and<br>
the time axis runs to the right. The phase shift<br>
between interference signal S and track error signal<br>
DPD-TE which is caused by vernier drive 6 and low-pass<br>
filter 21 is assumed to be zero for the sake of<br>
simplicity. The settling time of the two adjustment<br>
steps is also illustrated such that it is excessively<br>
short in comparison with the period of the wobbling<br>
frequency, for the sake of simplicity.<br>
A simple realization of the control device 24,<br>
comprising offset determining device 44 as well as the<br>
comparison device 45, by means of analogue components<br>
is specified in Figure 7. This representation<br>
corresponds to the right-hand part of Figure 1 and is<br>
also provided with the corresponding reference symbols.<br>
The functioning of the circuit illustrated is evident<br>
from the description specified above; therefore, the<br>
individual components such as operational amplifiers,<br>
etc., will not be discussed in further detail here.<br>
In accordance with a further possible design<br>
(not illustrated here), a circuit for determining the<br>
difference between the upper and lower envelopes of the<br>
track error signal DPD-TE is provided instead of the<br>
low-pass filter 27. This difference is minimal in the<br>
ideal case.<br>
In a further possible design which is likewise<br>
not illustrated here, a phase-independent synchronous<br>
rectifier with subsequent integration is • provided<br>
instead of the phase shifter 23 and the synchronous<br>
demodulator 33. Even though the hardware is somewhat<br>
more complicated to realize in this case, this measure<br>
is recommended,, on account of the higher accuracy<br>
achieved thereby.<br>
Since sample-and-hold circuits which operate<br>
with capacitors as charge stores cannot hold the<br>
voltage in a stable mariner for a long time, on account<br>
of leakage currents, digitization of the values of the<br>
output voltages VA and VB and holding of the values at<br>
the digital level are provided as an advantageous<br>
development of the present invention. The voltages VAS<br>
and VBS are then in turn output after having been<br>
subjected to digital-to-analogue conversion. In this<br>
case, the separation into absolute value and sign also<br>
advantageously take places at the digital level.<br>
It is particularly "advantageous to integrate<br>
the entire" sequence of the method, that is to say all<br>
of the circuit blocks in the right-hand part of Figure<br>
1 and the blocks of Figure 7, in a microcontroller.<br>
This necessitates a low-pass filter 27 or, as an<br>
alternative thereto, an envelope detector, see above.<br>
The output voltage TELP thereof is digitized by the<br>
microcontroller. The analogue delay elements 26X, 26Y<br>
are controlled via digital-to-analogue converters or,<br>
advantageously/ in a directly digital manner, and so<br>
too are the digital delay elements. Since, as a rule,<br>
the microcontroller controls the focus and track servo<br>
in any case, it can likewise undertake wobbling of the<br>
vernier drive 6 and comprise a phase-independent<br>
synchronous detector. This greatly minimizes the<br>
additional hardware outlay.<br>
Figure 8 shows part of an apparatus according<br>
to the invention of a further embodiment, which part<br>
serves for offset adjustment. This part may replace the<br>
corresponding part of Figure l which is situated<br>
between the summation points 15, 16, on the one hand,<br>
and the phase comparator 20, on the other hand. Here,<br>
too, the already added signals A+C and C+D are delayed<br>
between the summation points 15 and 16, respectively,<br>
and the phase comparator 20. For this purpose, a<br>
variable digital delay element 26U, to which the signal<br>
ABS(B) is applied, is inserted either into one or the<br>
other path by means of a switching device 25" . The<br>
switching device 25" switches in dependence on the<br>
signal SIGN(B). The two signals ABS(B) and SlGN(B) are<br>
derived, as described above, from the output signal VBS<br>
of the offset determining device 44. An advantage of<br>
this refinement is that only a single variable digital<br>
delay element 26U is required. A converter 19 is<br>
connected upstream of the variable digital delay<br>
element 26U, while a converter 19" is arranged in the<br>
other signal path, which does not contain a variable<br>
delay element. The converters 19, 19" may either be<br>
connected downstream of the switching device 25", as<br>
illustrated, or be connected upstream thereof.<br>
Figure 9 shows part of an apparatus according<br>
to the invention, corresponding to that illustrated for<br>
Figure 8, in a further embodiment. In this case, a<br>
variable analogue delay element 26A, 26S, 26c, 26D is<br>
assigned to each of the detector elements A, B, C, D<br>
and a variable digital delay element 265, 26T is<br>
arranged downstream of each summation point 15, 16. A<br>
converter 19, 19" is situated between summation<br>
point 15, 16 and, digital delay element 26S, 26T. A<br>
switching device 2S is controlled by the signal<br>
SIGN (B) and connects one of the digital delay<br>
elements 265, 26T to the signal ABS(B1. The signal<br>
ABS (K) is fed to the delay elements 26A, 26B or to the<br>
delay elements 26C and 26D via a switching device 25"",<br>
which is switched by the signal SIGN(B) , One advantage<br>
of this refinement is that switching devices 2b, 25""<br>
of simpler construction can be used. The range of<br>
adjustment of the analogue delay elements 25A to 25D<br>
can be. smaller, which reduces the complexity and thus<br>
the costs.<br>
It   goes   without   saying  that   practical<br>
combinations of the individual refinements illustrated<br>
here for compensating for the error caused by lens<br>
movement  and  for  compensating  for  th€  offset  are<br>
likewise with-in the scope ot the invention, even if<br>
they are not described in detail here. Implementing the<br>
setting of  the  analogue  and of  the  digital  delay<br>
elements by means of method steps which are nested in<br>
one  another  is  likewise  within  the  scope  of  the<br>
invention.<br>
