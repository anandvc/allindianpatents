Field of invention<br>
The invention relates to peptide analogues of α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH), which posses an increased efficay compared to the native α-MSH peptide. The α-MSH analogues exhibit increased anti-inflammatory effects and increased capability to treat or prevent whole body, organ or cell damages associated with ischemia or ischemia followed by vascular reperfusion compared to α-MSH.<br>
Background<br>
The native peptide a-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH) is known as the native agonist for the type 1, the type 3, the type 4 and the type 5 melanocortin (MC) receptor. The MC receptors belong to the class of G-protein coupled receptors. All receptor subtypes are coupled to a G-stimulatory protein, which means that receptor stimulation involves increased production of cAMP. ACTH is the native ligand to the Type 2 receptor (MC2).<br>
A series of studies have been performed on the MC receptors in a variety of tissues. Type 1 receptor (MCI), to which α-MSH binds with great affinity, is known to be expressed in several tissues and cells such a brain, including astrocytes, testis, ovary, macrophages and neutrophils. MCI is likely to be expressed, however, in an even wider range of tissues although this remains to be established. The selectivity for the MC receptors to bind different MSH peptides vary. MCI binds with great affinity α-MSH and with lower affinity also ß-MSH, γ-MSH and ACTH. MC2 has been reported only to bind ACTH, but none of the MSH peptides. The highest affinity for the ligands of the other receptors include γ-MSH (MC3-receptor), and ß-MSH (MC4-receptor). In contrast, MC5 binds with much lower affinity the MSH peptides with the same pattern as MCI (i.e. highest affinity for α-MSH).<br>
MSH-peptides acting through stimulation of the MC-receptors have a variety of functions including immunomodulation, anti-inflammation, body temperature regulation, pain perception, aldosterone synthesis, blood pressure regulation, heart rate, vascular tone, brain blood flow, nerve growth, placental development, synthesis/release of a variety of hormones such as aldosterone, thyroxin,<br><br>
prolactin, FSH. ACTH has a major effect on stimulating steroidoneogenesis. Also α-MSH induces pigment formation in skin.<br>
It is important to emphasize that a number of actions of MSH peptides, especially α-MSH, are not fully established with respect to which receptors are involved. The anti-inflammatory action of α-MSH has been speculated to involve a variety of processes including interference with NO production, endothelin-1 action, interleukin 10 formation, which again is linked to MCI receptors expressed in macrophages and monocytes.<br>
MC receptor stimulation with α-MSH has been shown to be important in a variety of inflammatory processes (Lipton and Catania 1997): 1) Inhibit chemotactive migration of neutrophils (Catania 1996). 2) α-MSH including analogs inhibit the release of cytokine (IL-1, TNF-α) in response to LPS treatment (Goninard 1996). 3) Inhibit TNF-α in response to bacterial endotoxin (Wong, K.Y. et al.,1997). 4) ICV or IP administration of α-MSH inhibit central TNF-α production by locally administered LPS. 5) α-MSH has been shown to reduce the inflammation in experimental inflammatory bowel disease (Rajora, N. et al., 1997), ishemia-induced acute renal failure (Star, R.A. et al., 1995). 6) α-MSH also have some protective effect by inhibiting the induction and elicitation of contact hypersensitivity and induces hapten tolerance, and it is speculated that α-MSH may mediate important negative regulation of cutaneous inflammation and hyper-proliferative skin diseases (Luger, T.A., 1997). To this end α-MSH causes increased IL-8 release from dermal microvasculature endothelial cells (Hartmeyer, M., 1997).<br>
Both hypoxia (ischemia) and reperfusion injuries are important factors in human pathophysiology. Examples of tissue hypoxia that predispose to injury during reperfusion include circulatory shock, myocardial ischemia, stroke, temporary renal ischemia, major surgery and organ-transplantation. Because diseases due to ischemia are exceedingly common causes of morbidity and mortality and because organ transplantation is increasingly frequent, treatment strategies with the potential of limiting reperfusion injuries is of great need in order to improve public health. The underlying pathophysiology of ischemia reperfusion injuries is complex and involves not only a classical inflammatory reperfusion response with neutrophil-infiltration, but also cytokine gene expression including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1ß, IL-6, IL-8, interferon-γ, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) within the reperfusion tissue/organ. Furthermore, it has been suggested that locally produced TNF-α contributes to postischemic<br><br>
organ dysfunction as in the postinfarctional heart by direct depression of contractility and induction of apoptosis. Because of the complex nature of ischemia and/or reperfusion injuries simple anti-inflammatory treatment concepts have been shown ineffective: Most experimental studies therefore point to the fact that concomitant interaction with more than one of the activated pathways is needed in order to protect against reperfusion injuries. α-MSH have been shown to have both anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative and anti-apoptotic abilities, which gives a good explanation for the effectiveness of this compound in order to protect against reperfusion injuries.<br>
It is known that certain modifications of amino acid residues in the α-MSH amino acid sequence result in an increased receptor affinity (for e.g. the MC4 receptor), prolonged biological activity or an more receptor-specific binding profile of the peptide (Schioth et al. 1998, Hruby et al. 1995, Sawyer et al. 1980, Hiltz et al. 1991, Scardenings et al. 2000). However, when aiming towards generation of peptidic drugs, these peptides still have problems with low stability towards enzymatic degradation.<br>
As stated above, the problem in the development of peptidic therapeutical active drugs is that peptides are rapidly and very effectively degraded by enzymes, generally with half-lives in the range of minutes. Proteases and other proteolytic enzymes are ubiquitous, particularly in the gastro-intestinal tract, and therefore peptides are usually susceptible to degradation in multiple sites upon oral administration, and to some extent in the blood, the liver, the kidney, and the vascular endothelia. Furthermore, a given peptide is usually susceptible to degradation at more than one linkage within the backbone; each locus of hydrolysis is mediated by a certain protease. Even if such obstacles are overcome, for neuropeptides in particular, difficulties have been encountered in their transport across the blood-brain barrier.<br>
In order to increase the metabolic stability of peptides, a technology called SIP (Structural Induced Probe) has been developed by Larsen et al. 1999 (WO 99/46283). The SIP technology is based on the use of structure inducing probes, which are represented by short peptide sequences, i.e. (Lys)6 added to the C-terminal or to the N-terminal or both the C- and N-termini of the parent peptide. The structural inducing probe constrains the parent peptide into a more ordered conformation based on intramolecular hydrogen bonds, whereby the peptide chimer (peptide linked to the probe) is less susceptible to proteases in contrast to peptides in the random-coil conformation. As a result of the structuring, the peptide chimer is much more difficult for a protease to degrade. The addition of a<br><br>
SIP to a biologically active peptide generally results in an increase in the enzymatic stability of the peptide while the biological activity at the same time is maintained (Rizzi et al. 2002).<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The present inventor has surprisingly shown that SIP-modification of α-MSH and α-MSH analogues in the N-terminal end of the peptides increases the maximal efficacy of the peptides compared to the native α-MSH peptide. The peptides of the invention display increased anti-inflammatory effects and increased capability to prevent ischemic conditions compared to the native α-MSH. Thus,   the   present   invention   relates   to   specific   peptides   comprising   a   SIP modification in the N-terminal part of the peptide and an amino acid sequence of α-MSH or a variant of α-MSH in the C-terminal part of the peptide.

As   described   above,   the   peptides   of   the   invention   possess   an   increased therapeutical  effect  and/or an   increased   maximal   response  and/or  increased maximal efficacy compared to the naturally occurring peptide α-MSH. The inventor has examined the biological effects of some of the peptides of the invention:<br>
Ac-(Lys)6-Ser-Tyr-Ser-Met-Glu-His-Phe-Arg-Trp-Gly-Lys-Pro-Val-NH2     (SEQ     ID NO: 1 *acetylated in the N-terminal and amidated in the C-terminal), Ac-(Glu)6-Ser-Tyr-Ser-Met-Glu-His-Phe-Arg-Trp-Gly-Lys-Pro-Val-NH2     (SEQ     ID NO: 2 *acetylated in the N-terminal and amidated in the C-terminal), Ac-(Lys)6-Ser-Tyr-Ser-Met-Glu-His-Phe-Arg-Trp-Gly-Lys-Pro-(D-Val)-NH2      (SEQ ID NO: 3 *acetylated in the N-terminal and amidated in the C-terminal), Ac-(Lys)6-Ser-Tyr-Ser-Nle-Glu-His-(D-Phe)-Arg-Trp-Gly-Lys-Pro-Val-NH2 (SEQ ID NO: 5 *acetylated in the N-terminal and amidated in the C-terminal), Ac-(Lys)6-Ser-Tyr-Ser-Nle-Glu-His-(D-Nal)-Arg-Trp-Gly-Lys-Pro-Val-NH2 (SEQ ID NO: 9 *acetylated in the N-terminal and amidated in the C-terminal), Ac-(Lys)6-Ser-Ser-Ile-Ile-Ser-His-Phe-Arg-Trp-Gly-Lys-Pro-Val-NH2 (SEQ ID NO: 13 *acetylated in the N-terminal and amidated in the C-terminal), Ac-(Lys)6-Ser-Ser-Ile-Ile-Ser-His-(D-Phe)-Arg-Trp-Gly-Lys-Pro-Val-NH2   (SEQ  ID NO: 17 *acetylated in the N-terminal and amidated in the C-terminal) In general, "Ac-" indicates that the peptide of the invention is acetylated in the N-terminal, and "-NH2" indicates that the peptide of the invention is amidated in the C-terminal.<br>
In a suspension of human leucocytes (experimental setup 1), all seven peptides dose-dependently inhibit IPS induced TNF-α accumulation (Examples 1-7). Surprisingly, it was found that all seven peptides were more effective, defined as the maximal inhibitory effect on TNF-α production, as well as more potent, defined as the concentration of the compound needed to give maximal inhibition of TNF-α accumulation, than the native melanocyte-stimulating hormone, α-MSH (Examples 1-7).<br>
The inventor has also investigated the effect of the seven peptides listed above (SEQ ID NO: 1*, SEQ ID NO: 2*, SEQ ID NO: 3*, SEQ ID NO: 5*, SEQ ID NO: 9*, SEQ ID NO: 13* and SEQ ID NO: 17*, all *acetylated in the N-terminal and amidated in the C-terminal) in a setup where systemic inflammation were induced by intravenous infusion of LPS in rats (experimental setup 2). It was shown that the peptides significantly inhibit LPS induced TNF-α accumulation in circulating blood. Surprisingly, all seven peptides (SEQ ID NO: 1*, SEQ ID NO: 2*, SEQ ID<br><br>
NO: 3*, SEQ ID NO: 5*, SEQ ID NO: 9*, SEQ ID NO: 13* and SEQ ID NO: 17*, all *acetylated in the N-terminal and amidated in the C-terminal) where able to inhibit TNF-α concentration in circulating blood to a higher degree than the native melanocyte-stimulating hormone α-MSH (examples 1-7). The inventor has also investigated the effect of the peptides:<br>
Ac-(Lys)6-Ser-Tyr-Ser-Met-Glu-His-Phe-Arg-Trp-Gly-Lys-Pro-Val-NH2 (SEQ ID NO: 1 *acetylated in the N-terminal and amidated in the C-terminal), and Ac-(Lys)6-Ser-Tyr-Ser-Nle-Glu-His-D-Phe-Arg-Trp-Gly-Lys-Pro-Val-NH2 (SEQ ID NO: 5 *acetylated in the N-terminal and amidated in the C-terminal) in a setup where inflammation were induced by inhalation of IPS in rats (experimental setup 3), and shown that the two peptides (SEQ ID N0:l* and 5*) significantly inhibits IPS induced eosinophil accumulation within the lungs (examples 1 and 2). Surprisingly, peptide (SEQ ID NO: 5*) in addition to this effect on eosinophils also markedly inhibited neutrophil infiltration to a much higher degree than was found in rats treated with the native melanocyte-stimulating hormone, α-MSH (example 2).<br>
Temporal ischemia of the kidney is frequently seen as a consequence of reduced blood pressure, hypovolemia, surgical interventions that involves reduction in renal and/or aortic blood flow, or associated with septicemia. This results in ischemia-induce acute renal failure, which for a large fraction deteriorates into chronic renal failure. Currently no efficient treatment exists to prevent the development of renal failure. A common finding in the post ischemic phase is the development of urinary concentration defects with the formation of increased production of solute free urine.<br>
Ischemia-induced experimental acute renal failure (ARF) induced by ischemia and reperfusion in rats is known to cause characteristic structural alterations in renal tubule epithelia in association with an impairment of urinary concentrating mechanism. This ischemia-induced ARF model provides an appropriate setting to evaluate the effect of a MSH analogue in ischemia-induced injury. The present inventor has investigated the effect of the peptide Ac-(Lys)s-Ser-Tyr-Ser-Met-Glu-His-Phe-Arg-Trp-Gly-Lys-Pro-Val-NH2 (SEQ ID NO: 1 *acetylated in the N-terminal and amidated in the C-terminal) and compared the effect of the peptide to the effect of the native peptide α-MSH in severe acute renal failure induced temporal bilateral occlusion of the renal arteries (experimental setup 6). When evaluated five days after the temporal renal artery occlusion, rats treated with vehicle developed polyuria defined by a 101% higher diuresis as the control rats, which had been subjected to sham occlusion of the renal arteries. Surprisingly, the<br><br>
compound (SEQ ID NO: 1 *acetylated in the N-terminal and amidated in the C-terminal) given in the same molar amount as the native peptide α-MSH, completely normalized the diuresis indicating that the peptide has the ability to protects against ischemia induced ARF, whereas treatment with the native peptide in this setting was unable to normalize the urine production. Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is one of the most common causes of death in the developed countries. AMI almost always occurs in patients with coronary atheroma because of sudden coronary thrombosis. Today, fibrinolytic therapy or primary percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) are standard treatments and can achieve early reperfusion in 50-70% of patients (spontaneous reperfusion rate is less than 30%). The goal of reperfusion is to reduce the size of the infarction, thereby reducing the development of impaired myocardial function. The overall effect of fibrinolysis/PTCA is a 20% reduction in short and long term mortality. However, AMI is associated with an inflammatory reaction, which is a prerequisite for healing and scar formation. Coronary artery occlusion critically reduces blood flow to the portion of the myocardium, which markedly impairs the energy metabolism. Significant duration of ischemia (&gt;20 min) induces infarction and results in an inflammatory response, which is both accelerated and augmented when the ischemic myocardium is reperfused.<br>
Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (MIR) activates not only a classical inflammatory reperfusion response with neutrophil-infiltration, but also myocardial cytokine gene expression including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-13, IL-6, IL-8, interferon-γ and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). This local myocardial over-expression of cytokines may play a critical role not only in the modulation of the size of the infarction, but also in the progression of the myocardial dysfunction, including vascular wall remodeling, heart failure, and cardiac hypertrophy. Furthermore, it has been suggested that locally produced TNF-α contributes to postischemic myocardial dysfunction via direct depression of contractility and induction of apoptosis.<br>
An increasing number of experimental studies have shown that anti-inflammatory/anti-oxidative/anti-apoptotic strategies have the ability to reduce infarct size in animal models of MIR. However, no clinical studies have shown significant effects in humans.<br>
In a model of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion in rats in which the left anterior coronary artery was occluded for 60 minutes, treatment with a peptide according to the invention was given just prior to removal of the coronary artery occlusion and the rats were then followed for another three hours. Then the ability of the<br><br>
peptides to reduce infarction size was evaluated and compared to the effect of the native peptide α-MSH (experimental setup 5). Surprisingly all three peptides:<br>
Ac-(Lys)6-Ser-Tyr-Ser-Met-Glu-His-Phe-Arg-Trp-Gly-Lys-Pro-Val-NH2     (SEQ     ID NO: 1 *acetylated in the N-terminal and amidated in the C-terminal), Ac-(Lys)6-Ser-Tyr-Ser-Nle-Glu-His-D-Phe-Arg-Trp-Gly-Lys-Pro-Val-NH2   (SEQ   ID NO: 5 *acetylated in the N-terminal and amidated in the C-terminal), and Ac-(Lys)6-Ser-Tyr-Ser-Nle-Glu-His-D-Nal-Arg-Trp-Gly-Lys-Pro-Val-NH2   (SEQ   ID NO: 9 *acetylated in the N-terminal and amidated in the C-terminal) reduced the  infarction  size to a  higher degree as the  native  peptide α-MSH (examples 1, 3-4).<br>

As earlier described, the native peptide α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH) is known as the native agonist for the type 1, the type 3, the type 4 and the type 5 melanocortin (MC) receptor, while ACTH is the native ligand to the Type 2 receptor (MC2). As the peptides comprise the amino acid sequence of α-MSH or an analogue thereof, the peptides of the invention have the ability to stimulate one or more melanocortin receptors, i.e melanocortin receptor type 1, 3, 4, or 5. Methods of preparation of peptides of the invention<br>
The peptides of the invention may be prepared by methods known per se in the art. Thus, the α-MSH, α-MSH-variants, α-MSH analogues and the X motif may be prepared by standard peptide-preparation techniques such as solution synthesis or Merrifield-type solid phase synthesis.<br>
In one possible synthesis strategy, the peptides of the invention may be prepared by solid phase synthesis by first constructing the pharmacologically active peptide sequence (α-MSH, α-MSH-variant or α-MSH analogue) using well-known standard protection, coupling and deprotection procedures, thereafter sequentially coupling the amino acid sequence of the motif X on the active peptide in a manner similar to the construction of the active peptide, and finally cleaving off the entire peptide from the carrier. This strategy yields a peptide, wherein the peptide sequence X is covalently bound to the pharmacologically active peptide at the N-terminal nitrogen atom of the peptide.<br>
Another possible strategy is to prepare the sequence of the α-MSH peptide/analogue and the X-motif (or parts thereof) separately by solution synthesis, solid phase synthesis, recombinant techniques, or enzymatic synthesis, followed by coupling of the two sequences by well-known segment condensation procedures, either in solution or using solid phase techniques or a combination thereof. In one embodiment, the α-MSH peptide/analogue may be prepared by recombinant DNA methods and the X motif may be prepared by solid phase synthesis. The conjugation of the α-MSH peptide/analogue and the X motif may be carried out by using chemical ligation. This technique allows for the assembling of totally unprotected peptide segments in a higly specific manner (Liu et al., 1996). The conjugation can also be performed by protease-catalysed peptide bond formation, which offers a highly specific technique to combine totally unprotected peptide segments via a peptide bond (Kullmann, 1987).<br><br>
Examples of suitable solid support materials (SSM) are e.g., functionalised resins such as polystyrene, polyacrylamide, polydimethylacrylamide, polyethyleneglycol, cellulose, polyethylene, polyethyleneglycol grafted on polystyrene, latex, dynabeads, etc.<br>
It should be understood that it may be necessary or desirable that the C-terminal amino acid of the peptide sequence of the X-motif or the C-terminal amino acid of the α-MSH, α-MSH-variant, or α-MSH analogue is attached to the solid support material by means of a common linker such as 2,4-dimethoxy-4'-hydroxy-benzophenone, 4-(4-hydroxy-methyl-3-methoxyphenoxy)-butyric acid, 4-hydroxy-methylbenzoic acid, 4-hydroxymethyl-phenoxyacetic acid, 3-(4-hydroxymethylphenoxy)propionic acid, and p-[(R,S)-a[l-(9H-fluoren-9-yl)methoxyformamido]-2,4-dimethoxybenzyl]-phenoxy-acetic acid. The peptides of the invention may be cleaved from the solid support material by means of an acid such as trifluoracetic acid, trifluoromethanesulfonic acid, hydrogen bromide, hydrogen chloride, hydrogen fluoride, etc. optionally in combination with one or more "scavengers" suitable for the purpose, e.g., ethanedithiol, triisopropylsilane, phenol, thioanisole, etc., or the peptide conjugate of the invention may be cleaved from the solid support by means of a base such as ammonia, hydrazine, an alkoxide, such as sodium ethoxide, an hydroxide, such as sodium hydroxide, etc.<br>
The peptides of the invention may also be prepared by means of recombinant DNA-technology using general methods and principles known to the person skilled in the art. A nucleic acid sequence encoding the peptide of the invention may be prepared synthetically by established standard methods, e.g., the phosphoamidite method. According to the phosphoamidite method, oligonucleotides are synthesized, e.g., in an automatic DNA synthesizer, purified, annealed, ligated and cloned in suitable vectors.<br>
The nucleic acid sequence encoding the peptide of the invention is then inserted into a recombinant expression vector, which may be any vector which may conveniently be subjected to recombinant DNA procedures. The choice of vector will often depend on the host cell into which it is to be introduced. Thus, the vector may be an autonomously replicating vector, i.e., a vector, which exists as an extrachromosomal entity, the replication of which is independent of chromosomal replication, e.g., a plasmid. Alternatively, the vector may be one which, when introduced into a host cell, is integrated into the host cell genome and replicated together with the chromosome(s) into which it has been integrated.<br><br>
In the vector, the nucleic acid sequence encoding the peptide of the present invention should be operably connected to a suitable promoter sequence. The promoter may be any nucleic acid sequence, which shows transcriptional activity in the host cell of choice and may be derived from genes encoding proteins either homologous or heterologous to the host cell. Examples of suitable promoters for directing the transcription of the nucleic acid sequence encoding said peptide in mammalian cells are the SV 40 promoter, the MT-1 (metallothionein gene) promoter or the adenovirus 2 major late promoter, a Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) promoter, cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter and a bovine papilloma virus promoter (BPV). A suitable promoter for use in insect cells is the polyhedrin promoter.<br>
Examples of suitable promoters for directing the transcription of the nucleic acid sequence encoding the peptide of the invention, especially in a bacterial host cell, are the promoters obtained from the E. coli lac operon, the Streptomyces coelicolor agarase gene (dagA), the Bacillus subtilis levansucrase gene (sacB), the Bacillus licheniformis alpha-amylase gene (amyL), the Bacillus stearothermophilus maltogenic amylase gene (amyM), the Bacillus amyloliquefaciens alpha amylase gene (amyQ), the Bacillus licheniformis penicillinase gene (penP), the Bacillus subtilis xylA and xylB genes, and the prokaryotic beta-lactamase gene, as well as the tac promoter. Further promoters are described in "Useful proteins from recombinant bacteria" in Scientific American, 1980, 242:74-94; and in Sambrook et al., 1989, supra.<br>
Examples of suitable promoters for directing the transcription of the nucleic acid sequence encoding the peptide of the invention in a filamentous fungal host cell are promoters obtained from the genes encoding Aspergillus oryzae TAKA amylase, Rhizomucor miehei aspartic proteinase, Aspergillus niger neutral alpha-amylase, Aspergillus niger acid stable alpha-amylase, Aspergillus niger or Aspergillus awamori glucoamylase (glaA), Rhizomucor miehei lipase, Aspergillus oryzae alkaline protease, Aspergillus oryzae triose phosphate isomerase, Aspergillus nidulans acetamidase, Fusarium oxysporum trypsin-like protease (as described in U.S. Patent No. 4,288,627, which is incorporated herein by reference), and hybrids thereof. Particularly preferred promoters for use in filamentous fungal host cells are the TAKA amylase, NA2-tpi (a hybrid of the promoters from the genes encoding Aspergillus niger neutral a amylase and Aspergillus oryzae triose phosphate isomerase), and glaA promoters.<br><br>
In a yeast host, useful promoters are obtained from the Saccharomyces cerevisiae enolase (ENO-1) gene, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae galactokinase gene (GAL1), the Saccharomyces cerevisiae alcohol dehydrogenase/glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase genes (ADH2/GAP), and the Saccharomyces cerevisiae 3-phosphoglycerate kinase gene. Other useful promoters for yeast host cells are described by Romanos et al., 1992, Yeast 8:423-488.<br>
The nucleic acid sequence encoding said peptide of the invention may also be operably connected to a suitable terminator, such as the human growth hormone terminator.

Examples of bacterial origins of replication are the origins of replication of plasmids pBR322, pUC19, pACYC177, pACYC184, pUB11O, pE194, pTAlO60, and pAMßl. Examples of origin of replications for use in a yeast host cell are the 2 micron origin of replication, the combination of CEN6 and ARS4, and the combination of CEN3 and ARS1. The origin of replication may be one having a mutation to make its function temperature-sensitive in the host cell (see, e.g., Ehrlich, 1978, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 75:1433).<br><br>
The vector may also comprise a selectable marker, e.g., a gene the product of which complements a defect in the host cell, such as the gene coding for dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) or one which confers resistance to a drug, e.g., neomycin, geneticin, ampicillin, or hygromycin. Suitable markers for yeast host cells are ADE2, HIS3, LEU2, LYS2, MET3, TRP1, and URA3. A selectable marker for use in a filamentous fungal host cell may be selected from the group including, but not limited to, amdS (acetamidase), argB (ornithine carbamoyltransferase), bar (phosphinothricin acetyltransferase), hygB (hygromycin phosphotransferase), niaD (nitrate reductase), pyrG (orotidine-5'-phosphate decarboxylase), sC (sulfate adenyltransferase), trpC (anthranilate synthase), and glufosinate resistance markers, as well as equivalents from other species. Preferred for use in an Aspergillus cell are the amdS and pyrG markers of Aspergillus nidulans or Aspergillus oryzae and the bar marker of Streptomyces hygroscopicus. Furthermore, selection may be accomplished by cotransformation, e.g., as described in WO 91/17243, where the selectable marker is on a separate vector. The procedures used to ligate the nucleic acid sequences coding peptide of the invention, the promoter and the terminator, respectively, and to insert them into suitable vectors containing the information necessary for replication, are well known to persons skilled in the art (cf., for instance, Sambrook et al., op.cit.). The host cell into which the expression vector is introduced may be any cell which is capable of producing the peptide of the invention and is may be a eukaryotic cell, such as invertebrate (insect) cells or vertebrate cells, e.g., Xenopus laevis oocytes or mammalian cells, in particular insect and mammalian cells. Examples of suitable mammalian cell lines are the COS (e.g., ATCC CRL 1650), BHK (e.g., ATCC CRL 1632, ATCC CCL 10) or CHO (e.g., ATCC CCL 61) cell lines.

The invention also relates to methods for the treatment or prevention of a condition in the tissue of one or more organs of an individual mammal in need thereof, the method comprising administering an effective dose of one or more peptides according to the invention. Said condition can be an ischemic or<br><br>
inflammatory  condition   and/or  result  from   toxic  effects  of  poising   or  drug<br>
treatment.<br>
The method of treatment of the invention may be of special benefit in relation to<br>
conditions caused by or associated with transplantation of any organ or vessel,<br>
including prevention of graft versus host reaction. In such conditions, the entire<br>
organ   is   extremely   sensitive   to   all   alterations   with   respect   to   nutrition,<br>
metabolism, perfusion etc., and the treatment according to the present invention<br>
is believed to stabilize the condition and make the tissue more resistant to any<br>
situation stressing the function of the organ. The method according to the present<br>
invention also encompasses administration of an effective dose of a peptide of the<br>
invention to the organ transplant during transport to the recipient,  including<br>
addition of an effective dose of a peptide of the invention to the transportation<br>
medium.<br>
Moreover, the present application provides evidence that treatment with an α-<br>
MSH analogue according to the invention in severe diseases such as myocardial<br>
ischemia dramatically prevents death and organ dysfunction.<br>

wherein the treatment according to the invention  may  be of special  interest.<br>
Conditions   relating   to   angina   include   unstable   angina,   stable   angina   and<br>
Prinzmetal 's variant angina.<br>

caused by pericarditis,  myocardiel infarction, myocardial ischemia, myocarditis,<br>
myxodemia, and endocarditis.<br>
The condition to be treated can be associated with cardial arrhythmia. Either as<br>
the primary disease or secondary to another condition of the individual. Examples<br>
of miscellaneous causes of arrhythmia include acute infections particularly those<br>
affecting  the  lungs,   pulmonary  embolism,   hypotension,  shock,  anoxaemia  or<br>
anaemia which can precipitate myocardial ischemia and thus cause arrhythmia.<br>
The arrhythmia will aggravate the circulatory disturbance and thereby set up a<br>
vicious, self-perpetuating cycle.<br>
It is believed that the treatment according to the present invention will increase<br>
the threshold for development of arrhythmia thus preventing the development of<br>
the arrhythmia. The effect may by directly on the conduction system or indirectly<br>
by acting on a condition tricking or being the cause of the arrhythmia.<br>
A syndrome or an arrhythmia which can be alleviated according to the present<br>
method may be either primary or secondary and may be selected from ventricular<br>
or supra ventricular tachyarrhythmias, atrioventricular block, sinus node disease,<br><br>
Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, Lenegres disease, Lev's disease any syndrome involving an abnormal myocardial connection between atrium and ventricle. Antiarrhythmic therapy performed with the aim of suppressing an arrhythmia is always associated with a risk of creating new arrhythmias. The arrhythmias may occur as a toxic reaction due to an overdose of the drug. However, particularly during treatment with the group of drugs known as Class IA drugs, arrhythmias can occur as a non dosage-dependent side effect - an idiosyncratic reaction -developing at drug concentrations well within the therapeutic range. According to a further embodiment, the condition may be caused by one or more antiarrhytmic drugs including, digitalis, quinidine, disopyramide, adenosin, aprindine, flecainide, amiodarone, sotalol, meciletine, beta blocking agents, and verapamil. It is contemplated that treatment with an α-MSH analogue according to the invention will decrease the risk of developing arrythmias due to concommittant treatment with other antiarrythmic medicament(s).<br>
In a further aspect of the invention, the condition may be characterised by one or more abnormalities as measured by electrocardiography (ECG). The abnormality on the ECG may relate to an alteration selected from one or more changes in the configuration selected from the P wave, the ST segment, the T wave, the QRS complex, the Q wave, the delta wave, and the U wave.<br>
Other conditions which may be alleviated by administration of an effective dose of a peptide according to the invention are the effect of electrolyte derangement on the organ (e.g. the heart) as well as the derangement itself, including abnormalities in the relative concentrations of individual ions one to another. Such condition includes an abnormal serum concentration of one or more of the electrolytes selected from the group consisting of potassium, calcium, sodium, and magnesium<br>
According to the present invention, the tissue that may be affected includes one or more cell types present in the organ and may be selected from epithelial cells, macrophages, the reticulo endothelial system monocytes, neutrophil granulocytes, eosinophil granulocytes, basophil granulocytes, T-cells, B-cells, mast cells, and dendritic cells. Especially, the T-cells, B-cells, and mast cells may be of certain interest in this respect.<br>
A preferred aspect of the invention relates to prevention or treatment wherein a dose of α-MSH analogue according to the invention is administered prophylactically for preventing a progress of the condition or of any symptom of the condition.<br><br>
A preventive or prophylactic treatment may be an ongoing treatment during e.g.<br>
surgery or for the prevention of heart attacks in a patient suffering from coronary<br>
stenosis. The preventive treatment may also be for a limited period. The skilled<br>
person will be able to evaluate the specific treatment schedule based on the actual<br>
situation.  In  a preferred embodiment, the treatment or prevention  is able to<br>
reduce the infarction size upon ischemia of the coronary arteries. Such infarction<br>

Pharmaceutical formulations and compositions<br>
The invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising one or more<br>
peptides   according   to  the   invention.   Said   pharmaceutical   compositions   may<br>
further   comprise   one   or   more   pharmaceutical   carriers.   Furthermore,   said<br>
pharmaceutical compositions may further comprise one or more pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable excipients<br>
The  pharmaceutical compositions according to  invention  can  be,  but are  not<br>
limited to, a parental, oral, topical, trans-mucosal or trans-dermal composition.<br><br>
In the following examples, suitable compositions containing one or more peptides according to the invention are given. For the administration to an individual (an animal or a human) the substance(s) are preferably formulated into a pharmaceutical composition containing the substance(s) and, optionally, one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients.<br>
The compositions may be in form of, e.g., solid, semi-solid or fluid compositions such as, e.g., but not limited to bioabsorbable patches, drenches, dressings, hydrogel dressings, hydrocolloid dressings, films, foams, sheets, bandages, plasters, delivery devices, implants, powders, granules, granulates, capsules, agarose or chitosan beads, tablets, pills, pellets, microcapsules, microspheres, nanoparticles, sprays, aerosols, inhalation devices,gels, hydrogels, pastes, ointments, creams, soaps, suppositories, vagitories, tooth pastes, solutions, dispersions, suspensions, emulsions, mixtures, lotions, mouthwashes, shampoos, enemas, kits containing e.g. two separate containers, wherein the first one of the containers contains a peptide according to the invention and the second container contains a suitable medium intended to be added to the first container before use in order to obtain a ready-to-use composition; and in other suitable forms such as, e.g., implants or coating of implants or in a form suitable for use in connection with implantation or transplantation.<br>
The compositions may be formulated according to conventional pharmaceutical practice, see, e.g., "Remington: The science and practice of pharmacy" 20th ed. Mack Publishing, Easton PA, 2000 ISBN 0-912734-04-3 and "Encyclopedia of Pharmaceutical Technology", edited by Swarbrick, J. &amp; J. C. Boylan, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1988 ISBN 0-8247-2800-9.<br>
A pharmaceutical composition comprising an active substance serves as a drug delivery system. In the present context the term "drug delivery system" denotes a pharmaceutical composition (a pharmaceutical formulation or a dosage form), which upon administration presents the active substance to the body of a human or an animal. Thus, the term "drug delivery system" embraces plain pharmaceutical compositions such as, e.g., creams, ointments, liquids, powders, tablets, etc. as well as more sophisticated formulations such as sprays, plasters, bandages, dressings, devices, etc.<br>
As mentioned  above,  a  pharmaceutical  composition  for use  according  to the invention may comprise pharmaceutically or cosmetically acceptable excipients. The choice of pharmaceutically acceptable excipients in a composition for use according   to   the   invention   and   the   optimum   concentration   thereof   cannot<br><br>
generally be predicted and must be determined on the basis of an experimental determination thereof. Also whether a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient is suitable for use in a pharmaceutical composition is generally dependent on which kind of dosage form is chosen. However, a person skilled in the art of pharmaceutical formulation can find guidance in e.g., "Remington: The science and practice of pharmacy" 20th ed. Mack Publishing, Easton PA, 2000 ISBN 0-912734-04-3.<br>
A pharmaceutically acceptable excipient is a substance, which is substantially harmless to the individual to which the composition will be administered. Such an excipient normally fulfils the requirements given by the national drug agencies. Official pharmacopeias such as the British Pharmacopeia, the United States of America Pharmacopeia and the European Pharmacopeia set standards for well-known pharmaceutically acceptable excipients.<br>
In the following is given a review on relevant pharmaceutical compositions for use according to the invention. The review is based on the particular route of administration. However, it is appreciated that in those cases where a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient may be employed in different dosage forms or compositions, the application of a particular pharmaceutically acceptable excipient is not limited to a particular dosage form or of a particular function of the excipient.

The invention will hereinafter be described by way of the following non-limiting Figures and Examples.<br>
Examples<br>
In the following the methods for testing the peptides of the invention are described in general. The results for the tested peptides are given in examples 1-7. The aim of the methods is to test the peptides of the invention for anti-inflammatory effects and ability to inhibit or prevent the cell/tissue/organ impairment or destruction occurring as a result of ischemia, inflammation or toxic effects of a drug.<br><br>
An inflammatory response or an exacerbation in chronic inflammation is characterized by production of cell-derived mediators such as tumor necrosis factor a (TNF)-α, interleukins (IL-113, IL-8), nitric oxide (NO), and free oxygen radicals, which eventually will induce widespread endothelial damage with loss of arteriolar tonus in systemic vessels, increased capillary permeability, sustained hypotension and organ dysfunction, which in the lung is associated with accumulation of leucocytes including neutrophils and eosinophils within the alveolar space. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), released from infectious agents, plays a central role in the inflammatory response to infection by inducing a number of inflammatory mediators including TNF-α. Treatments with the ability to inhibit TNF-α production are therefore believed to have marked anti-inflammatory effects. The inventor is using LPS stimulation to produce an inflammatory response in a number of setups (see experimental setups 1-3) and the primary marker for an anti-inflammatory effect of the peptides according to the invention is the ability to inhibit TNF-α production.<br>
Ischemia induced by reduced/complete arrest in arterial blood supply induces multiple tissue reactions including neutrophil accumulation, other inflammatory responses and cell death. Identification of compounds that could inhibit or prevent (either completely or partially) many of the cell/tissue/organ impairments or destructions occurring as a result of ischemia/inflammation is of great benefit. The inventor is using two models of temporarily ischemia: 1) the myocardial ischemia reperfusion model in rats, which mimics the development of acute myocardial infarction followed by restoration of blood supply as it is achieved by either fibrinolytic therapy or coronary angioplasty (Experimental setup 4); 2) bilateral renal artery occlusion, which induces acute renal failure (ARF) comparable to AFR induced by temporarily reduction in the renal blood supply as seen in patients undergoing major surgical interventions (an example could be surgical intervention due to abdominal aorta aneurism) (experimental setup 5). Nephrotoxicity is a well-known side effect to cisplatin treatment. Though not necessarily dose limiting renal toxicity still affects the majority of patients and a significant decrease in glomerular filtration rate is observed during treatment. The renal toxicity of cisplatin is seen as a direct cytotoxic damage on the nephrons in the outer medulla especially in the S3 segment of the proximal tubules and in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle. Hence cisplatin treatment often results in tubular reabsorption defects including an impaired ability to dilute the urine. Hypomagnesemia is observed in approximately 50% of patients treated with<br><br>
cisplatin and is probably due to a defect in renal magnesium (Mg) reabsorption. A recent study has suggested that Mg supplementation is a crucial factor in protection against the nephrotoxic actions of Cyclosporin A and a possible relation between Mg loss and cisplatin induced nephrotoxicity has recently been suggested. Treatment aimed to prevent hypomagnesemia would therefore have beneficial effects in order not only to reduce the need of Mg supplementation, but also in order to reduce the renal toxicity of cisplatin. The effect of the peptides according to the invention on cisplatin induced nephrotoxicity is examined in experimental setup 6.<br>

Experimental setup 2<br>
Inhibition of LPS induced TNFα production in rats in vivo<br>
Experimental animals. Female Wistar rats (220 - 240 g) are obtained from the<br>
Charles River, Sulzfeld, Germany, and housed in a temperature- (22-24°C) and<br>
moisture-controlled (40-70 %) room with a 12 h light-dark cycle (light on from<br>
6:00 A.M. to 6:00 P.M.). The rats are maintained on a standard rodent diet with<br>
140 mmol/kg of sodium, 275 mmol/kg potassium and 23% protein (Altromin<br>
International, Lage, Germany) and have free access to water.<br>
Animal  preparation.  In isoflurane-nitrous oxide anesthesia,  the animals are<br>
implanted with  permanent medical grade Tygon  catheters into the abdominal<br>
aorta and the inferior caval vein, respectively, via a femoral artery and vein. After<br>
instrumentation, the animals are housed individually for 7-10 days until the day of<br>
the experiment.<br>
Experimental protocol. Prior to the experiments all rats are adapted to the<br>
restraining cage used for the experiments by training them for two periods of two<br>
hours each.  On  the  day  of the  experiment,  the  animal   is  transferred to  a<br>
restraining cage, and an intravenous infusion of vehicle solution containing 150<br>
mM glucose is started. The infusion rate is 0.5 ml/h throughout the experiment.<br>
After a short adaptation period, infusion of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is started. LPS<br>
(E coli serotype 0127 B8, L 3129, Sigma, St. Louis, USA) is given at a dose of 4<br>
mg/kg body weight delivered as an i.v. infusion over 1 hour.<br>
Arterial blood samples of 0.3 ml are taken 60, 90, and 120 minutes after start of<br>
the LPS infusion and replaced immediately with heparinized blood from a normal<br>
donor rat.<br>

Measurement of TNF-α  in  plasma:  The  blood  samples  are  collected  in  a<br>
prechilled test tube with 0.5 mM EDTA, pH 7.4, and 20 x 106 lU/ml aprotinin.<br>
After centrifugation at 4°C, plasma samples are transferred to pre-chilled test<br>
tubes and stored at -20°C for later measurements of TNF-α. TNF-α in plasma is<br>
determined by an ELISA (Biotrak, Amersham, UK).<br>
Statistical analyses. Results are presented as means ± SE. A two-way ANOVA<br>
for repeated measures is used to test for differences between groups. In case of<br>
P
t-tests with Bonferroni 's correction of the level of significance.<br>
Experimental setup 3<br>
Inhibition of neutrophil and eosinophil infiltration after LPS inhalation in<br>
rats.<br>
Male Sprague-Dawley rats (weight ~200 g) from M&amp;B A/S, DK-8680 Ry, Denmark, are used for all experiments. The rats are caged in standard cages type 3 and housed in a temperature- (22-24 °C) and moisture-controlled (40-70 %) room with a 12 h light-dark cycle (light on from 6:00 A.M. to 6:00 P.M.). The diet is autoclaved Altromin 1324 special formulation, Produced by Altromin Denmark, Chr, Pedersen A/S, 4100 Ringsted, Denmark. Diet and water are administered ad libitum.<br>
After acclimatization the rats are randomly allocated to the experimental groups and dosed i.v. with test compound at start of LPS-induction and once again 8 hours after LPS-induction.<br>
Rats in groups of 3 are anaesthetized with 0,1 ml hypnorm/dormicum pr. 100 g and dosed i.v with the test compound. Immediately after dosing they are placed in the inhalation chamber where they are subjected to a nebulized LPS solution. The concentration of LPS is 1 mg/ml. Dosing time is 15 minutes. The rats are euthanized 24 hours after dosing with the test substance. At termination the rats are eutanized with CO2/O2.<br>
Then bronchoalveolar lavage is performed by installing and withdrawing 6 x 2,5 ml of PBS to the right lung. Lavage is done with the lungs remaining in the thorax after removing sternum and costae. The connection to the left lung is tied off during this procedure. Bronchoalveolar fluid (BALF) is centrifuged at 1000 rpm at<br><br>
4°C for 10 minutes. After removing the supernatant the cell pellet is resuspended<br>
in 0.5 ml PBS and total cell count performed. Two smears of BALF stained with<br>
May-Griiwald Giemsa stain is made from each rat. BALF from each rat is subjected<br>
to total cell count and to differential count of leucocytes.<br>
Experimental groups:<br>
In addition to LPS infusion all rats are treated with bolus injections of either:<br>
Vehicle (0.5 mL isotonic saline);<br>
α-MSH: 200 µg/kg/bw<br>
α-MSH analogue: 200  µg/kg/bw<br>
Finally a time control group without LPS inhalation is treated with Vehicle.<br>
Statistics<br>
Data are presented as mean ± S.E.. Between group comparisons are performed<br>
by one way analysis of variance followed by Fishers Least Significant Difference<br>
test. Differences are considered significant at the 0.05 level.<br>
Experimental setup 4<br>
Inhibition of LPS induced cytokine release and pulmonary hypertension in<br>
pigs in vivo.<br>
Female Landrace pigs (~30 kg) are fasted overnight but allowed free access to water. Then the pigs are premedicated with intramuscular ketamine (10 mg/kg) and midazolam (0.25 mg/kg). Anesthesia is induced with intravenous ketamine (5 mg/kg). The pigs are orally intubated, and anesthesia is maintained with a continuous intravenous infusion of fentanyl (60  µg/kg/h and midazolam (6 mg/kg/h). The animals are ventilated with a volume-controlled ventilator (Servo 900 ventilator; Siemens Elema, Solna, Sweden) with a positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cm H2O. Tidal volume is kept at 10-15 ml/kg, and the respiratory rate adjusted (20-25 breaths/min) to maintain normocapnia (arterial carbon dioxide tension [PaC02] in the range of 34-45 mmHg). Ventilation is performed with oxygen in air aimed tot reach an arterial oxygen tension (Pa02) higher than 105 mmHg. One arterial and 2 venous sheaths are placed in the carotid artery and corresponding veins for infusion, blood pressure measurements through fluid filled catheter, blood sampling and for introducing catheters. A Swan-Ganz catheter (Edwards Lifescience Corp., Irvine, CA) is inserted in the pulmonary artery via the right cava superior vein. Localization of the balloon-tipped catheter is determined by observing the characteristic pressure trace on the monitor as it is advance through the right side of the heart into the pulmonary artery as well as by x-ray. Another catheter (5 French; St. Jude Medical Company,<br><br>
St. Paul, MN) is inserted into the left carotid artery for continuous blood pressure monitoring and blood sampling. A urine catheter is inserted for urine collection. A temporary pace catheter is inserted through the venous sheath to the right atrium (x-ray guided) to standardise heart rate, when assessing cardiac performance Hemodynamic Monitoring. Continuous observations is performed of arterial blood pressure, heart rate (from the electrocardiogram), and pulmonary artery pressure (PAP).<br>
Lipopolysaccharide Infusion. Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide endotoxin, (E co// 026:_6, Bacto Lipopolysaccharides; Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI) is dissolved in saline 120 min before each experiment to dissolve any precipitate. After a stabilization period, lipopolysaccharide infusion is started at baseline at a rate of 2.5 µg/kg/h and increased stepwise to 15 µg/kg/min during 30 min. After this, the fusion was kept at a rate of 2.5 µg/h kg/h during 150 min and thereafter discontinued.<br>
Interventional groups: The control group is given vehicle in equal volume to the intervention group immediately before IPS infusion is initiated. The interventional group is given a dose of α-MSH analogue, 200 µg/kg, as a single intravenous bolus injection.<br>

Experimental setup 5<br>
Inhibition of myocardial infarction size, induced by 60 minutes occlusion of<br>
the left anterior descending coronary artery in rats.<br>
Barrier-bred and specific pathogen-free female Wistar rats (250 g) are obtained from Charles River, Hannover, Germany. The animals are housed in a temperature (22-24°C) and moisture (40-70%) controlled room with a 12-hour light-dark cycle (light on from 6:00 A.M. to 6:00 P.M.). All animals are given free access to tap water and a pelleted rat diet containing approximately 140 mmol/kg of sodium, 275 mmol/kg potassium and 23% protein (Altromin catalogue no. 1310, Altromin International, Lage, Germany).<br>
The rats are instrumented with permanent medical grade Tygon catheters in the inferior caval vein and the abdominal aorta via the femoral vein and artery. One<br><br>
week later the Rats are anaesthetized in an inhalation chamber with 4% isoflurane in 02. After insertion of an endotracheal tube the animal is artificially ventilated with 1.0% isoflurane in O2 using af Hugo Basile Rodent ventilator. Tidal volume is 8-10 ml/kg b.w. and respiratory rate 75 min-1, which maintains arterial pH between 7.35 and 7.45. During surgery the animal is placed on a heated table that maintains rectal temperature at 37-38°C. Standard ECG (second lead) is measured using a Hugo Sachs ECG Coupler and collected on line at 4,000 Hz in PowerLab. After parasternal thoracotomy and opening of the pericardium the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) is localized visually. An atraumatic 6-0 silk suture with an occluder that allows reopening of the ligature is placed around the LAD between the pulmonary trunk and the lower right end of the left auricle. After 10 minutes the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) is occluded. Successful occluding is confirmed by alterations in ECG (ST-segment elevation and increase in R-wave amplitude) and by fall in MAP. Reperfusion is made after 60 minutes by opening the occluder. Control rats are sham-operated. The rats are subjected to one of the following i.v treatments: Vehicle: 0.5 ml 150 mM NaCI.<br>
α-MSH: 200 ug or 1000 µg α-melanocyte stimulating hormone/kg b.w. in 0.5 ml 150 mM NaCI.<br>
Test compound 200µg or 1000µg test compound/kg b.w. in 0.5 ml 150 mM NaCI.<br>
Treatment is given 5 minutes prior to reperfusion.<br>
Determination af the size of the ischemic and necrotic myocardium The rats are kept anaesthetized after the ischemia/reperfusion and re-occluding of the LAD is performed after three hours reperfusion. During this period ECG and MAP are measured continuously. Then Evans Blue dye (1 ml; 2% w/v) is administered i.v. to determine the size of the ischemic area. The heart is removed and cut into horizontal slices to determine the size of the ischemic area and to separate the ischemic myocardium from the non-ischemic myocardium. The ischemic area is isolated and incubated in a 0.5% triphenyltetrazolium chloride solution for 10 minutes at 37°C. The size of the necrotic tissue is then measured by used of a computerized image program. An additional setup of animals are treated with buprenorphine post-surgical and returned to there cages for measurement of left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP) two weeks later in order to evaluate the effect of the pharmacological treatment on the development of congestive heart failure. LVEDP is measured using a 2F microtip catheters<br><br>
inserted into the left ventricle via the right carotid artery. Isoflurane concentration<br>
is adjusted to stabilize mean arterial pressure (MAP) at 85-90 mmHg.<br>

Inhibition of renal failure induced by 40 minutes bilateral occlusion of the<br>
renal arteries in rats<br>
Barrier-bred and specific pathogen-free female Wistar rats (250 g) are obtained from Charles River, Hannover, Germany. The animals are housed in a temperature (22-24°C) and moisture (40-70%) controlled room with a 12-hour light-dark cycle (light on from 6:00 A.M. to 6:00 P.M.). All animals are given free access to tap water and a pelleted rat diet containing approximately 140 mmol/kg of sodium, 275 mmol/kg potassium and 23% protein (Altromin catalogue no. 1310, Altromin International, Lage, Germany).<br>
The rats, which previously have been instrumented with a chronic venous catheter, are placed in metabolic cages and after a two days acclimation period to the metabolic cages, experimental ARF is induced by occlusion of both renal arteries for 60 min. During surgery, the rats are anesthetized with isoflurane-nitrous oxide and placed on a heated table to maintain rectal temperature at 37°C. Both kidneys are exposed through flank incisions, mobilized by being dissected free from the perirenal fat, then a small portion of the renal artery is gently dissected from the vein. The renal arteries are occluded with a smooth surfaced vascular clip (60 g pressure; World Precision Instruments, UK) for 40 min. Total ischemia is confirmed by observing blanching of the entire kidney surface, During the period of ischemia, the wounds are closed temporarily to maintain body temperature. After the clips are removed, the kidneys are observed for additional 2-5 min. to ensure color change, indicating blood reflow. Then the wound are closed with 3-0 silk ligatures. The rats returned to the metabolic cages, and daily 24 h urine output and water intake are measured for five days. As a control group, rats are subjected to sham operations identical to the ones used for ARF rats without occlusion of the renal arteries. Sham-operated rats are monitored in parallel with rats with ARF.<br><br>
The rats are subjected to one of the following i.v treatments: Vehicle: 0.5 ml 150 mM NaCI.<br>
α-MSH: 200 µg α-melanocyte stimulating hormone/kg b.w. in 0.5 ml 150 mM NaCI.<br>
Test compound: 200 µg test compound/kg b.w. in 0.5 ml 150 mM NaCI. Treatment is given 5 minutes prior to reperfusion of the kidney and subsequently 6 and 24 hours later.<br>

Inhibition of Cisplatin induced renal failure<br>
Rats, which previously have been instrumented with a chronic venous catheter, are placed in metabolic cages and after a period of acclimation to the metabolic cages the rats are treated with an intreperitoneal cisplatin injection 5.0 mg/kg bw in 0.5 ml 150 mM NaCI or vehicle (0.5 ml 150 mM NaCI). Five days later the rats are then returned to metabolic cages, and daily 24 h urine output and water intake are measured and collected for the next five days. All rats are then anesthetized in halothan/N2O and an arterial blood sample collected in prechilled EDTA coated vials. The blood samples are collected in a prechilled test tube with 0.5 mM EDTA, pH 7.4, and 20 x 106 lU/ml aprotinin. After centrifugation at 4°C, plasma samples are transferred to pre-chilled test tubes and stored at -20 °C for later measurements of creatinine and Magnesium (Mg). In addition to this creatinine is also measured in the urine collected in the last 24 hours period prior to the blood collection. Creatinine clearance (Ccr), used as an index of glomerular filtration rate (GFR), can then be calculated as the Ccr= Vu x Ucr/Pcri where Vu is 24 hours urine production; Ucr is the the creatinine concentration on the urine and Pcr is the creatinine concentration in plasma. Measurement of creatinine in urine and plasma is performed by use of the clinical chemistry systems VITROS 950 (Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics Inc., Johnson &amp;. Johnson, NJ) and Roche Hitachi Modular (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany).<br><br>
The rats are subjected to one of the following i.v treatments: Vehicle: 0.5 ml 150 mM NaCI<br>
