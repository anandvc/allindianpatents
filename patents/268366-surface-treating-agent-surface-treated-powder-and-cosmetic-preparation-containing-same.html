SURFACE-TREATING AGENTS, SURFACE-TREATED POWDERS, AND COSMETICS COMPRISING THE SAME<br>
RELATED APPLICATIONS [0001]       This application claims the priority of Japanese Patent Application No. 2004-294618 filed on October 7,  2004 and Japanese Patent Application No. 2004-294619 filed on October 7, 2004, which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	The    present    invention    relates    to    surface "treating    agents,<br>
surface-treated powders, and cosmetics comprising the same, and in particular, relates to the improvement of hydrophobicity and rinsability of the powder used in cosmetics.<br>
PRIOR ART [0003] For cosmetics, especially for makeup cosmetics, the beautifying effect, which makes people beautiful, is naturally expected. In addition, the sustainability of the beautifying effect, namely, long-lasting makeup is one of very important required characteristics. Thus, in the development of cosmetic base material, one of important themes has been longer-lasting makeup. In the field of makeup cosmetics, oily bases are often used so that the makeup does not deteriorate with moisture such as sweat, tears, and saliva. When hydrophilic powder is blended in an oily base, the powder easily separates from the base. In addition, the hydrophilic powder is washed away with moisture, and it becomes a major cause of makeup deterioration. In the past, when powder was blended into cosmetics, the powder that had been hydrophobized in advance was often used for blending. [0004]       There are numerous methods for the hydrophobization of powder used<br><br>
in cosmetics. For example, a powder hydrophobization method, in which higher fatty acids, higher alcohols, hydrocarbons, triglycerides, esters, silicones such as silicone oil and silicone resin, or fluorine compounds are used, has been practiced to cover the surface of hydrophilic powder. In particular, the powder hydrophobizing treatment, in which silicones are used as the surface-treating agent, can provide excellent hydrophobicity. Thus, numerous methods have been established so far (refer to patent literatures 1 and 2, for example). In recent years, a method in which a copolymer of acrylic acid and acrylic acid ester is used as the powder surface-treating agent is also known (refer to patent literature 3, for example).<br>
[0005] On the other hand, the rinsability of cosmetics is also one of the important required characteristics. When the above-described conventional hydrophobized powder is blended, a longer-lasting makeup can be achieved. However, the makeup cannot be easily rinsed away with water, even when soap is used, because of the excellent hydrophobicity. Therefore, oily cleansing agents have been widely used, however, it also becomes necessary to wash away this oily cleansing agent with soap. Thus, the burden to users becomes high. When hydrophilic powder is blended to allow easy rinsing, the makeup easily deteriorates and the makeup is short-lasting as described above. Thus, it has been a very difficult theme to satisfy both the characteristics: long lasting makeup in use and easy rinsing after use. [0006]<br>

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention was  made in view of the  above-described<br><br>
problem, and the objects of the invention are to provide surface-treating agents that can provide excellent hydrophobicity to powder and can improve its rinsability, to provide surface-treated powders that are generated with the surface-treating agent, and to provide cosmetics that comprise the surface-treated powder.<br>
[0008]	The  present inventors have  diligently researched in view  of the<br>
above-described problem and focused on the pH-responsive hydrophobicityhydrophilicity change. The present inventors treated the surface of the powder with a polymer that comprised, as a constituent monomer, an acrylic derivative of a specific structure and found that the hydrophobicityhydrophilicity of the surface-treated powder dramatically changes with the pH change. That is, the surface-treated powder with the above-described polymer shows excellent hydrophobicity in the acidic to neutral region, where general cosmetics are used. On the other hand, the surface of the powder becomes hydrophilic in the moderately basic conditions that are generated with soap water. As a result, we found that when the surface-treated powder was blended in cosmetics, the makeup was long-lasting; nevertheless, the makeup could be easily rinsed away with water by using soap, thus leading to the completion of the present invention.<br>

[0037] The polymer of the present invention may include one or more kind of any monomer (B) represented by the above-described general formulas (2) to (7) as the constituent monomer.<br>
The    polymer    of   the    present    invention    preferably    comprises    the above-described monomer (B) in 1 to 30 mole % of the total constituent monomers. If the content of the monomer (B) is less than 1 mole %, the blending effect cannot be achieved. If the content of the monomer (B) is more than 30 mole %, the   relative   content  of monomer   (A)   becomes   small.  As   a   result,   desired<br><br>
characteristics may not be provided to the powder.<br>
[0038] The polymer of the present invention can comprise a monomer other than the above-described monomers (A) and (B) as the constituent monomer so far as the effect of the present invention is not undermined. The content equal to or less than 30 mole % of the total constituent monomers is satisfactory, and the content can be, for example, about 1 to about 20 mole %. Examples of the monomer include acrylamide, methacrylamide, N-vinylpyrrolidone, 8-caprolactam, vinylalcohol, maleic anhydride, diallyldimethylammonium chloride, and styrene.<br>
[0039]	The polymer of the present invention can be obtained by polymerizing<br>
various monomers, including the above-described monomers, by publicly known polymerization methods. For example, homogeneous solution polymerization, heterogeneous solution polymerization, emulsion polymerization, inverse emulsion polymerization, bulk polymerization, suspension polymerization, and precipitation polymerization can be used. For example, in the case of homogeneous solution polymerization, the polymer of the present invention can be obtained by dissolving various monomers in a solvent, adding a radical polymerization initiator under a nitrogen atmosphere, and heating the solution with stirring. In addition, the polymer of the present invention can be obtained by the post-modification in which functional groups are attached to polyacrylic acid or polyacrylamide.<br>
[0040] As the solvent for the polymerization, any solvent can be used so far as various monomers can be dissolved or suspended and it is an organic solvent containing no water. Examples include alcohol solvents, such as methanol, ethanol, propyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, and butyl alcohol; hydrocarbon solvents, such as hexane, heptane, octane, isooctane, decane, and liquid paraffin? ether solvents, such as dimethyl ether, diethyl ether, and tetrahydrofuram ketone solvents, such as acetone and methyl ethyl ketone; ester solvents, such as methyl<br><br>
acetate, ethyl acetate, and butyl acetate; chlorine solvents, such as methylene chloride, chloroform, and carbon tetrachloride; dimethylformamide; diethylformamide; dimethyl sulfoxide; and dioxane. More than one kind of these solvents can be mixed for use. It is usually preferable to select a solvent that has a higher boiling point than the initiation temperature of the polymerization initiator.<br>
[0041] The polymerization initiator is not limited in particular so far as it can initiate radical polymerization, and examples include peroxides such as benzoyl peroxide, azo compounds such as azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) and dimethyl 2,2'-azobis(isobutyrate), and persulfate polymerization initiators such as potassium persulfate and ammonium persulfate. The polymerization can be conducted, without depending on a polymerization initiator, by a photochemical reaction, radiation, or the like. The polymerization temperature should be equal to or more than the polymerization initiation temperature of each polymerization initiator. For example, about 50 to about 70 °C is usually suitable for the peroxide polymerization initiator.<br>
[0042] The polymerization time is not limited in particular, and it is usually about 30 minutes to about 24 hours. When a polymer with a relatively high molecular weight is desirable, the desirable reaction time is about 24 hours. If the reaction time is too short, the unreacted monomer remains and the molecular weight may turn out to be relatively small. The average molecular weight of the polymer of the present invention is not limited in particular. If the degree of polymerization is more than that of oligomers, the desired effect can be achieved. However, the average molecular weight is preferably about 3000 to about 100 thousand. In polymerization by mixing more than one kind of monomer, a copolymer in which various monomers are randomly added can usually be obtained. [0043]        The surface-treated powder of the present invention is characterized in<br><br>
that the above-obtained polymer is coated on the powder surface. [0044] The polymer used in the present invention has carboxyl groups, which are derived from the above-described monomer (A), on the side chains of the polymer. The carboxyl group changes to a hydrophobic carboxylic acid (-COOH) under acidic to neutral conditions and changes to a hydrophilic carboxylate ion (-COO'M+) under basic conditions. Therefore, the powder the surface of which is treated with this polymer, for example, is considered to be hydrophobic in the acidic to neutral environment and hydrophilic in the basic environment. As a result, the pH-responsive hydrophobicityhydrophilicity change is exhibited.<br>
When the thus obtained surface-treated powder is blended in cosmetics, the cosmetics show hydrophobicity in the acidic to neutral region, where cosmetics are normally used, achieving long-lasting makeup. Nevertheless, when the surrounding becomes moderately basic with soap, the treated powder surface becomes hydrophilic and the makeup can be easily rinsed away. [0045] The above-de scribed monomer (B) is not easily affected by pH, and the monomer shows a stable hydrophilic or hydrophobic property in the wide range of pH. Therefore, if a polymer is prepared by appropriately adjusting the ratio of the above-described monomer (A) and monomer (B) as the constituent monomers, the desirable hydrophobicity-hydrophilicity balance, which is provided to the powder, can be achieved. For example, it is possible to increase the hydrophilicity by combining a monomer (B) represented by the general formula (2) with the above-described monomer (A). On the contrary, it is possible to increase the hydrophobicity by combining a monomer (B) represented by the general formula (6) with the above-de scribed monomer (A). In addition, it is possible to increase the adsorption of powder to the polymer by utilizing an appropriate amount of the above-described monomer (B).<br>
[0046]        In the polymer used in the present invention, the mole ratio (A):(B) of the monomer (A) and the monomer (B) should preferably be adjusted within the<br><br>
range from 70:30 to 99.9:0.1. If the content of the monomer (A) is less than the ratio of 70:30, the treated powder will become hydrophilic, and satisfactory hydrophobicity may not be achieved. On the other hand, if the content of the monomer (A) is more than the ratio of 99.9: 0.1, it will become difficult to adsorb a polymer on the powder surface, and the stability of the powder may be negatively affected.<br>
[0047] The powder used in the present invention is not limited in particular, and examples include inorganic powders, such as silicic acid, silicic anhydride, magnesium silicate, talc, kaolin, mica, bentonite, titanated mica, bismuth oxychloride, zirconium oxide, magnesium oxide, zinc oxide, titanium oxide, aluminum oxide, calcium sulfate, barium sulfate, magnesium sulfate, calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate, iron oxide, ultramarine blue, iron blue, chromium oxide, chromium hydroxide, carbon black, and composites thereof! and organic powders, such as polyamide, polyester, polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyurethane, vinyl resin, epoxy resin, polycarbonate resin, divinylbenzene/styrene copolymer, copolymers consisting of more than one kind of monomer of the above-described compounds, celluloid, acetylcellulose, cellulose, polysaccharides, protein, CI pigment yellow, CI pigment orange, and CI pigment green. The shape of powder can be any shape, for example, plate, agglomerate, scaly shape, sphere, porous sphere, and the particle size is also not limited in particular.<br>
[0048]	In the preparation of the  surface-treated powder of the  present<br>
invention, the surface treatment of the powder can be conducted by any normal treatment method; thus, the method is not limited in particular. Examples of the treatment of the powder with the above-de scribed polymer include the method in which the polymer is dissolved in a suitable solvent such as ethyl alcohol, the powder is mixed into the solution and stirred, and then the solvent is removed; and the method in which a polymer dissolved in a non-volatile oil such as a<br><br>
higher alcohol is directly mixed into the powder with stirring. When the surface-treated powder of the present invention is blended into cosmetics, the polymer may be directly mixed, with stirring, into the powder base during the production process of the cosmetics.<br>
[0049]	In the  present invention,  when the  powder is  treated with the<br>
above-described polymer, it is necessary to pay attention to the zeta potential of the powder. Here, the zeta potential of the powder indicates a difference between the potential of the outermost surface (sliding surface) of the moving layer, which is in close contact with the solid phase, and the potential in the solution during the relative movement of the solid phase and the liquid phase. When the solution is at near-neutral pH, the zeta potential of titanium oxide and silica is negative! on the contrary, the zeta potential of zinc oxide and alumina is positive. When a powder with the positive zeta potential, such as zinc oxide or alumina, is treated with the normal method, the carboxylic acid site, which is important for pH response, is countered by the positive charge of the powder surface. As a result, the obtained surface-treated powder may not exhibit a pH response. In order to provide pH response capability to the powder, it is necessary to change the zeta potential of the powder surface to be negative by treating the powder surface with an inorganic compound or an organic compound possessing a negative charge, such as silica or polystyrene sulfonic acid. Examples of such a treatment method include the method in which the powder is dispersed in a water glass solution, and silica is deposited on the surface by the dropwise addition of an acid; and the method in which the powder is dispersed in an aqueous solution of polystyrene sulfonic acid, and water is evaporated.<br>
[0050] In the surface-treated powder of the present invention, the mass ratio of the coated polymer to the powder (polymer : powder) is preferably 3-97 to 40-60 and more preferably 5^95 to 30^70. If the amount of coated polymer is less than 3:97, desired characteristics may not be provided to the powder. If the amount of<br><br>
coated polymer is more than 4(K60, the feeling during the use of the cosmetics<br>
may be negatively affected.<br>
[0051]        The cosmetics of the present invention are characterized in that the<br>
above   obtained  surface-treated  powder  is  comprised  in  the  cosmetics.   The<br>
blending amount of the surface-treated powder is preferably equal to or more<br>
than 3 mass % of the total amount of cosmetics and more preferably 5 to 95<br>
mass %. If the blending amount is less than 3 mass %, the effect of the present<br>
invention may not be achieved.<br>
[0052]        To the cosmetics of the present invention, normally used cosmetic<br>
ingredients,   such   as   water,   oil,   powder   (untreated),   surfactant,   fluorine<br>
compounds,    resin,    thickener,    preservative,    perfume,    ultraviolet    absorber,<br>
moisturizer, bioactive component, salts, solvent, antioxidant, chelating agent,<br>
neutralizing agent, and pH adjusting agent may be blended in addition to the<br>
above-de scribed  surface-treated powder  so  far  as  the  effect of the  present<br>
invention is not undermined.<br>
[0053]        The forms of cosmetics in the present invention are not limited in<br>
particular. Their examples include makeup cosmetics such as foundation, white<br>
face powder, lipstick, eye shadow, cheek color, mascara, and eye liner! sunscreen!<br>
foundation cream! and hair cream.<br>

(methanol /water-9/l) were dissolved 4.9823 g (17.1 mmol) of sodium 11-methacrylamidoundecanoate (NaMAU), 186.5 mg (0.9 mmol) of 2"acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonic acid (AMPS), 39.6 mg (0.99 mmol) of sodium hydroxide, and 7.4 mg (0.045 mmol) of azobisisobutyronitrile. The solution was deaerated by bubbling argon for 30 minutes, the container was covered with a septum, and the polymerization was conducted by heating the solution at 60 °C for 12 hours. After the completion of the polymerization reaction, the reaction solution was dropwise added into a large excess of ether, and the resulting precipitate was collected by filtration under suction. This precipitate was dissolved in water, dialyzed against pure water for 1 week, and 2.78 g of random NaMAU/AMPS copolymer (95/5) was obtained by freeze-drying (yield: 53.71%).<br>
Into water was dissolved 1.54 g of the collected NaMAU/AMPS copolymer, and the pH was adjusted to 4 with hydrochloric acid. This solution was dialyzed against water of pH 5 for 1 week, and 0.97 g of random MAU/AMPS copolymer<br><br>
(95/5) was obtained by freeze-drying.<br>
[0060]        In the following section, the surface treatment method of powder with<br>
the surface-treating agent of the present invention will be described.<br>
Powder Treatment Example 1<br>
Into 500 mL of ethanol were dissolved 45 g of a polymer prepared by the above-de scribed Synthesis Example 1 or Synthesis Example 2 and 15 g of stearic acid. Into this solution was blended 240 g of titanium oxide and dispersed, and the ethanol was evaporated with an evaporator. The obtained agglomerate was pulverized, and the surface-treated powder was obtained.<br>
The obtained treated powder was dissolved, by mixing, into a buffer solution of pH 5 and a buffer solution of pH 10 in a powder-solution ratio of 1:100. This solution was centrifuged to isolate the powder, and the residual liquid was removed by drying. The obtained powder was analyzed by elemental analysis to measure the degree of polymer coating, and the content of polymer was found to be 15 mass % of the total powder, and the content of stearic acid was 5 mass % of the total powder. [0061] Examples 1-1 to 1-4 and Comparative Examples 1-1 to 1-4<br>
In order to investigate the properties of the powder that has been surface-treated with the polymer of the present invention, the present inventors prepared titanium oxide powders that were surface-treated with various polymers according to the above-described Synthesis Example 1, Synthesis Example 2, and Powder Treatment Example 1. Then the present inventors evaluated the water solubility of the treated powders under the acidic (pH 5) and the basic (pH 10) conditions. In addition, similar tests were conducted using silicones and acrylic acid/acrylic acid ester copolymer, which are traditional hydrophobizing surface-treating agents, as comparative examples. Evaluation results are shown in Table 1 and Figs. 1 and 2. The evaluation method was as<br><br>
follows.<br>
[0062]<br>
Water Solubility of Treated Powder<br>
Each of 0.1 g titanium oxide powder that has been surface-treated with various surface-treating agents and a 30 mL aqueous buffer solution of pH 5 or pH 10 were placed in a vial, mixed for 1 minute by stirring with a magnetic stirrer, and allowed to stand. Then the condition of each solution was checked. o: Powder evenly dissolved in water, and it formed a white cloudy solution, x: Powder did not dissolve in water, and it separated on the water surface. [0063] Table 1<br><br>
[0064] As shown in Table 1 and Figs. 1 and 2, the surface-treated powder with MAU homopolymer or MAU/AMPS copolymer of the present invention (Examples 1-1 to 1-4) did not dissolve in water under acidic condition (pH 5).<br><br>
Thus,  the  powder was found to have  excellent hydrophobicity under acidic<br>
condition (pH 5). On the other hand, under basic condition (pH 10), the treated<br>
powder evenly dissolved in water. Thus, the powder was found to change to<br>
hydrophilic under basic condition (pH  10). That is to say, when the powder<br>
treated with the polymer of the present invention is blended into cosmetics, the<br>
powder has excellent hydrophobicity in the acidic to neutral region, in which<br>
normal cosmetics are used; as a result, the makeup is long-lasting. Nevertheless,<br>
the powder can be easily rinsed away with water under the moderately basic<br>
condition that is generated with soap because the powder surface changes to<br>
hydrophilic.<br>
[0065]        In contrast, the powder that is surface-treated with silicones or acrylic<br>
acid/acrylic acid ester copolymer, which is the traditionally used hydrophobizing<br>
agent in cosmetic powder (Comparative Examples 1-1 to 1-4), dissolved in water<br>
neither under acidic condition (pH 5) nor under basic condition (pH 10). Thus,<br>
when the powder treated with the traditional surface-treating agent is blended in<br>
cosmetics, long-lasting makeup could be achieved. However, it is difficult to rinse<br>
away with soap water because excellent hydrophobicity is maintained even under<br>
basic conditions.<br>
[0066]<br>
Synthesis Example  3: 3*{4-[(Methacryloxy)methyl]phenyl}acrylic acid (MMPA)<br>
homopolymer<br>
[0067]<br>
[Formula 10]<br><br><br>
[0068]<br>
1)	Synthesis of MMPA monomer<br>
In 25 g of acetone were dissolved 2.46 g (15 mmol) of 4-hydroxycinnamic acid and 0.005 g of butylhydroxytoluene. To the solution was dropwise added 1.57 g (15 mmol) of methacryloyl chloride, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 3 hours. After the completion of the reaction, to the solution was dropwise added 1.67 g of triethylamine, and then 100 g of 0.015N dilute hydrochloric acid solution was added. The resulting precipitate was collected by filtration under suction. The precipitate was washed with water and dried at 30 °C under reduced pressure, whereby 2.09 g of MMPA monomer was obtained (yield: 60%). By the NMR analysis of the product, the formation of MMPA monomer was confirmed. The NMR analysis results are shown in Fig. 3. [0069]<br>
2)	Polymerization of MMPA monomer<br>
In   100   g  of tetrahydrofuran  was   dissolved   2.01   g   (9   mmol)   of the above-obtained MMPA monomer, and nitrogen was bubbled through the solution<br><br>
for 40 minutes. Subsequently, 0.038 g (0.23 mmol) of azobisisobutyronitrile that<br>
was dissolved in 10 g of tetrahydrofuran was dropwise added to the solution.<br>
After   nitrogen   was   bubbled   through   the   solution   for    10   minutes,   the<br>
polymerization was conducted by stirring at 60 °C for 24 hours. After the<br>
completion of the polymerization reaction, the reaction solution was concentrated<br>
with an evaporator, and the precipitate was removed by the addition of ethyl<br>
acetate. The solution was concentrated again with an evaporator. By drying at<br>
30 °C under reduced pressure, 1.64 g of MMPA homopolymer was obtained (yield:<br>
82%).<br>
[0070]<br>
Powder Treatment Example 2<br>
In 50 mL of tetrahydrofuran was dissolved 1 g of MMPA homopolymer, which was prepared in the above-described Synthesis Example 3. In this solution, 9 g of titanium oxide was blended and dispersed, and tetrahydrofuran was evaporated with an evaporator. The obtained agglomerate was pulverized, whereby the surface-treated powder was obtained. [0071] Example 1-5<br>
The present inventors prepared titanium oxide powder that was surface-treated with MMPA homopolymer according to the above-described Powder Treatment Example 2. The obtained treated powder was blended and dispersed in buffer solutions of pH 5 and pH 10 in a powder-solution ratio of 1:100. Thus, the water solubility of the treated powder under acidic condition (pH 5) and basic condition (pH 10) was evaluated. The results are shown in Fig. 4. [0072] As shown in Fig. 4, surface-treated powder with MMPA homopolymer of the present invention (Example 1-5) did not dissolve in water under acidic condition (pH 5). On the other hand, under basic condition (pH 10), the treated powder evenly dissolved in water.  Thus,  it was confirmed that the powder<br><br>
changed from hydrophobic to hydrophilic by the change of pH.<br>
[0073]        Subsequently, the present inventors conducted infrared spectroscopic<br>
measurement of the MMPA polymer of the above-described Synthesis Example 3<br>
under the condition of no treatment and under the condition of 1 M NaOH<br>
solution treatment. The results are shown in Fig. 5.<br>
[0074]       As shown in Fig. 5, the MMPA homopolymer of the present invention<br>
shows peaks due to carboxylic acid (-COOH) under the condition of no treatment.<br>
Under the condition of 1 M NaOH solution treatment, the above-de scribed peaks<br>
due to the carboxylic acid disappear, and the appearance of a new carboxylate ion<br>
(•COO") peak was identified. According to the results, the polymer of the present<br>
invention is in the form of hydrophobic carboxylic acid under acidic to neutral<br>
conditions,   and  it  changes   to  the   hydrophilic  carboxylate   ion  under  basic<br>
conditions. As a result, the pH-responsive hydrophobicityhydrophilicity change<br>
is considered to take place.<br>
[Example 2]<br>
[0075]       The present inventors prepared cosmetics in which the surface-treated<br>
powder with the polymer of the present invention is blended, and the evaluation<br>
was conducted.<br>
Example 2-1<br>
In 1000 mL of ethanol were dissolved 34.5 g of the MAU/AMPS copolymer (MAU/AMPS=95/5), which was prepared according to the above-described Synthesis Example 2, and 34.5 g of stearic acid. In this solution, 85 g of talc, 50.8 g of sericite, 10 g of titanium oxide, 6 g of nylon powder, 0.4 g of black iron oxide, 5.8 g of yellow iron oxide, and 2 g of red iron oxide were blended and dispersed, and the ethanol was evaporated with an evaporator. The obtained agglomerate was pulverized, and the surface-treated powder of Example 2-1 was obtained. [0076] Example 2-2<br><br>

In 59.70 g of methanol were dissolved 17.96 g (66.67 mmol) of 11-methacrylamidoundecanoic acid (MAU), 2.04 g (7.41 mmol) of methoxypolyethylene glycol monomethacrylate (Blenmer PME-200: Nippon Oil &amp; Fats Co.), and 0.30 g (1.83 mmol) of azobisisobutyronitrile (Nacalai Tesque, Inc.). The solution was deaerated by bubbling nitrogen for 60 minutes. The container was covered with a septum, and the polymerization was conducted by heating at 60°C for 20 hours. After the completion of the polymerization reaction, the obtained solution was dropwise added into a large excess of ethyl acetate, and the<br><br>
resulting precipitate was collected by filtration under suction. After drying under<br>
reduced    pressure,    9.69    g    of   random    MAU/methoxypolyethylene    glycol<br>
monomethacrylate copolymer (90/10) was obtained (yield: 48.5%). The weight<br>
average molecular weight was 110000.<br>

In 59.70 g of methanol were dissolved 19.80 g (73.50 mmol) of 11-methacrylamidoundecanoic acid (MAU), 0.20 g (0.74 mmol) of methoxypolyethylene glycol monomethacrylate (Blenmer PME-200: Nippon Oil &amp; Fats Co.), and 0.30 g (1.83 mmol) of azobisisobutyronitrile (Nacalai Tesque, Inc.). The solution was deaerated by bubbling nitrogen for 60 minutes. The container was covered with a septum, and the polymerization was conducted by heating at 60°C for 20 hours. After the completion of the polymerization reaction, the obtained solution was dropwise added into a large excess of ethyl acetate, and the resulting precipitate was collected by filtration under suction. After drying under reduced pressure, 10.28 g of random MAU/methoxypolyethylene glycol monomethacrylate copolymer (99/1) was obtained (yield: 51.4%). The weight average molecular weight was 34000. [0108]<br>
Example 3-27: 11-Methacrylamidoundecanoic acid (MAUVmethacryloxymodified silicone copolymer (90/10)<br>
In a mixed solution of 30 g of methanol and 30 g of chloroform were dissolved 14.16 g (52.57 mmol) of 11-methacrylamidoundecanoic acid (MAU), 5.84 g (5.84 mmol) of methacryloxy-modified silicone (FM-0711: Chisso Corporation), and 0.24 g (1.46 mmol) of azobisisobutyronitrile (Nacalai Tesque, Inc.). The solution was deaerated by bubbling nitrogen for 60 minutes. The container was covered with a septum, and the polymerization was conducted by heating at 60°C<br><br>
for 20 hours. After the completion of the polymerization reaction, the solution was concentrated to dryness under reduced pressure, and the solid was dissolved in 100 g of tetrahydrofuran. The obtained solution was dropwise added into a large excess of n-hexane, and the resulting precipitate was collected by filtration under suction. After drying under reduced pressure, 12.15 g of random MAU/methacryloxymodified silicone copolymer (90/10) was obtained (yield: 60.8%). The weight average molecular weight was 53000. [0109]<br>
Example 3-28^ 11-Methacrylamidoundecanoic acid (MAU) /2-methacryloxyethyl phosphoric acid copolymer (90/10)<br>
In a mixed solvent of 75 g of methanol and 25 g of ion-exchanged water were dissolved 18.40 g (68.32 mmol) of 11-methacrylamidoundecanoic acid (MAU), 1.60 g (7.59 mmol) of 2-methacryloxyethyl phosphoric acid (Phosmer-M^ Uni-Chemical Co.), 0.30 g (7.59 mmol) of sodium hydroxide, and 0.31 g (1.89 mmol) of azobisisobutyronitrile (Nacalai Tesque, Inc.). The solution was deaerated by bubbling nitrogen for 60 minutes. The container was covered with a septum, and the polymerization was conducted by heating at 60°C for 20 hours. After the completion of the polymerization reaction, a gelatinous product was obtained. This product was dried under reduced pressure, and 6.0 g of the dried material was added to 200 g of methanol. After sufficient stirring, insoluble material was removed by filtration. The obtained solution was dropwise added into a large excess of ethyl acetate, and the resulting precipitate was collected by filtration under suction. After drying under reduced pressure, 2.01 g of random MAU/2-methacryloxyethyl phosphoric acid copolymer (90/10) was obtained. The weight average molecular weight was 190000. [Example 4]<br>
