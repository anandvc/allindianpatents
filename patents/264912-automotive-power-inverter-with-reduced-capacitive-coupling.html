TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
 The present invention generally relates to automotive power<br>
inverters, and more particularly relates to an automotive power inverter with<br>
reduced capacitive coupling.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
 The electric motors, as well as other components, used in<br>
alternative fuel vehicles, such as hybrid and fuel cell vehicles, often utilize<br>
alternating current (AC) power supplies. However, the power sources, such as<br>
batteries and fuel cells, used in such applications only provide direct current<br>
(DC) power. Thus, devices known as power inverters are used to convert the<br>
DC power to AC power.<br>
 Modern automotive power inverters often utilize power modules<br>
(or microelectronic die), which include integrated circuits with multiple<br>
semiconductor devices (e.g., transistors and diodes) formed thereon, to convert<br>
the DC power to AC power. Due to the high amounts of current used, the<br>
power modules generate large amounts of heat. In order to ensure reliable<br>
performance, the power inverters also include cooling systems to transfer heat<br>
away from the power modules.<br>
 Conventional cooling systems used in automotive inverters often<br>
include a metal heat sink, or cold plate (i.e., with a coolant flowing<br>
therethrough), connected directly to the chassis of the inverter. The power<br>
modules are usually mounted to a stack of various substrates and/or a base<br>
plate, which is attached to the heat sink. Heat from the power modules is<br><br>
conducted through substrates and/or baseplate into the heat sink, where it is<br>
removed from the inverter. The heat sink may also be used to cool other<br>
electronic components within the chassis of the inverter, such as busbars,<br>
inductors and capacitors.<br>
 When the power modules are operated, capacitive coupling<br>
between the power modules and the chassis occurs, and electromagnetic<br>
interference (EMI) currents are injected into the chassis, which can adversely<br>
affect the performance of the inverter and the motor. Thus, "Y-caps," or Y-<br>
capacitors, are often installed at the DC power inputs to the inverter to reduce<br>
the effects of the capacitive coupling and the EMI currents, thus increasing the<br>
costs of manufacturing.<br>
 Accordingly, it is desirable to provide an inverter assembly with a<br>
reduced capacitance between the chassis and the power modules.<br>
Furthermore, other desirable features and characteristics of the present<br>
invention will become apparent from the subsequent detailed description and<br>
the appended claims, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings<br>
and the foregoing technical field and background.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
 An automotive power inverter is provided. The automotive power<br>
inverter includes a chassis, a microelectronic die coupled to the chassis having<br>
a plurality of power electronic switches formed thereon, and an insulating<br>
region having a thickness of at least 1 mm between the chassis and the<br>
microelectronic die.<br>
 An automotive drive system is also provided. The automotive<br>
drive system includes a direct current (DC) power supply, an electric motor<br>
coupled to the DC power supply, and a power inverter coupled to the electric<br>
motor and to the DC power supply to receive DC power from the DC power<br><br>
supply and provide alternating current (AC) power to the electric motor. The<br>
power inverter includes a chassis comprising a conductive material, a housing<br>
connected to the chassis, the housing comprising an insulating material and<br>
forming a chamber, a microelectronic die connected to the housing within the<br>
chamber, the microelectronic die having an integrated circuit with at least one<br>
transistor formed thereon, a nozzle connected to the housing within the<br>
chamber and directed at the microelectronic die to spray a cooling fluid onto<br>
the microelectronic die to remove heat from the microelectronic die during<br>
operation thereof, and an insulating region between the chassis and the<br>
microelectronic die.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF AN EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENT The following detailed description is merely exemplary in nature<br>
and is not intended to limit the invention or the application and uses of the<br>
invention. Furthermore, there is no intention to be bound by any expressed or<br>
implied theory presented in the preceding technical field, background, and<br>
brief summary, or the following detailed description.<br>
 The following description refers to elements or features being<br>
"connected" or "coupled" together. As used herein, unless expressly stated<br>
otherwise, "connected" means that one element/feature is directly joined to (or<br>
directly communicates with) another element/feature, and not necessarily<br>
mechanically. Likewise, unless expressly stated otherwise, "coupled" means<br>
that one element/feature is directly or indirectly joined to (or directly or<br>
indirectly communicates with) another element/feature, and not necessarily<br>
mechanically. However, it should be understood that although two elements<br>
may be described below, in one embodiment, as being "connected," in<br>
alternative embodiments similar elements may be "coupled," and vice versa.<br>
Thus, although the schematic diagrams shown herein depict example<br>
arrangements of elements, additional intervening elements, devices, features,<br>
or components may be present in an actual embodiment. It should also be<br>
understood that FIGS. 1-5 are merely illustrative and may not be drawn to<br>
scale.<br>
 FIG. 1 to FIG. 5 illustrate a power inverter and an automotive drive<br>
system that includes the power inverter. The power inverter includes a<br>
chassis, a microelectronic die having an integrated circuit formed thereon, the<br>
microelectronic die being coupled to the chassis, and an insulating region<br>
between the chassis and the microelectronic die to reduce a capacitance<br>
between the chassis and the microelectronic die.<br><br>
 The power inverter may also include a cooling mechanism that<br>
allows for the inverter to be arranged such that the capacitance between the<br>
chassis and the microelectronic die is minimized. The cooling mechanism<br>
may not be a heat sink electrically connected directly to the chassis. The<br>
insulating region may include an air gap and/or an insulating body. FIG. 1 illustrates a vehicle (or automobile) 10 according to one<br>
embodiment of the present invention. The automobile 10 includes a chassis<br>
12, a body 14, four wheels 16, and an electronic control system 18. The body<br>
14 is arranged on the chassis 12 and substantially encloses the other<br>
components of the automobile 10. The body 14 and the chassis 12 may jointly<br>
form a frame. The wheels 16 are each rotationally coupled to the chassis 12<br>
near a respective corner of the body 14.<br>
 The automobile 10 may be any one of a number of different types<br>
of automobiles, such as, for example, a sedan, a wagon, a truck, or a sport<br>
utility vehicle (SUV), and may be two-wheel drive (2WD) (i.e., rear-wheel<br>
drive or front-wheel drive), four-wheel drive (4WD) or all-wheel drive<br>
(AWD). The vehicle 10 may also incorporate any one of, or combination of, a<br>
number of different types of engines, such as, for example, a gasoline or diesel<br>
fueled combustion engine, a "flex fuel vehicle" (FFV) engine (i.e., using a<br>
mixture of gasoline and alcohol), a gaseous compound (e.g., hydrogen and/or<br>
natural gas) fueled engine, a combustion/electric motor hybrid engine, and an<br>
electric motor.<br>
[8021]- In the exemplary embodiment illustrated in FIG. 1, the automobile<br>
10 is a hybrid vehicle, and further includes an actuator assembly 20, a battery<br>
22, a power inverter assembly (or inverter) 24, and a radiator 26. The actuator<br>
assembly 20 includes a combustion engine 28 and an electric motor/generator<br>
(or motor) 30. As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, the electric<br>
motor 30 includes a transmission therein, and although not illustrated also<br><br>
includes a stator assembly (including conductive coils), a rotor assembly<br>
(including a ferromagnetic core), and a cooling fluid (i.e., coolant). Still referring to FIG. 1, in one embodiment, the combustion engine<br>
28 and the electric motor 30 are integrated such that both are mechanically<br>
coupled to at least some of the wheels 16 through one or more drive shafts 31.<br>
The radiator 26 is connected to the frame at an outer portion thereof and<br>
although not illustrated in detail, includes multiple cooling channels<br>
therethough that contain a cooling fluid (i.e., coolant) such as water and/or<br>
ethylene glycol (i.e., "antifreeze) and is coupled to the engine 28 and the<br>
inverter 24. In the depicted embodiment, the inverter 24 receives and shares<br>
coolant with the electric motor 30, and the radiator 26 is similarly connected to<br>
the inverter 24 and the electric motor 30 through a pump 32. The electronic control system 18 is in operable communication<br>
with the actuator assembly 20, the battery 22, and the inverter 24. Although<br>
not shown in detail, the electronic control system 18 includes various sensors<br>
and automotive control modules, or electronic control units (ECUs), such as<br>
an inverter control module and a vehicle controller, and at least one processor<br>
and/or a memory which includes instructions stored thereon (or in another<br>
computer-readable medium) for carrying out the processes and methods as<br>
described below. It should be understood that the inverter control module may<br>
also be integrated into the power inverter assembly 24. FIGS. 2 and 3 illustrate the inverter 24, according to one<br>
embodiment, in greater detail. As shown schematically in FIG. 2, the inverter<br>
24 includes three pairs of series switches 33 coupled to the battery 22 and the<br>
electric motor 30. Referring to FIG. 3, the inverter 24 also includes, amongst<br>
other components, a housing 34, a chassis 36 connected to and/or within the<br>
housing 34, a module stack 38, and an atomizer 40. The housing 34 may be<br>
made of a molded plastic material and enclose a module chamber 42. The<br><br>
chassis 36 may be made of a metal, such as aluminum, and although not<br>
shown may form a frame around various other components of the inverter 24,<br>
such as a capacitor assembly that includes a set, or sets, of conductive plates,<br>
in a spaced relationship and wound into coils to form a capacitor, or multiple<br>
capacitors, as in commonly understood.<br>
 The module stack 38 is connected to the housing 34 and includes a<br>
direct, or double, bonded copper (DBC) substrate 44 and an electronic<br>
component, or microelectronic die 46. The DBC substrate 44 includes a<br>
ceramic core 48 and two copper layers 50 formed on opposing sides (i.e.,<br>
upper and lower) of the ceramic core 48. The microelectronic die 46 includes<br>
a semiconductor substrate (e.g., silicon substrate) with an integrated circuit<br>
formed thereon that includes one or more of the switches 33 (e.g., power<br>
electronic switches) shown in FIG. 2 in the form of individual semiconductor<br>
devices, such as insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs), as is commonly<br>
understood. The microelectronic die 46 is mounted to the copper layer 50 on<br>
the upper side of the ceramic core 48 of the DBC substrate 44 with solder 51. In the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 3, the module stack 38 is<br>
positioned in a spaced relationship from the chassis 36 with an insulator (or<br>
insulating region) 52 having a thickness 53 formed therebetween. In one<br>
embodiment, the thickness 53 of the insulator 52 is at least 1 millimeter (mm),<br>
such as between 1 mm and 125 mm. The module stack 38 may be positioned<br>
such that the microelectronic die 46 lies a distance 54 from the chassis 36 that<br>
is greater than the thickness 53 of the insulator 52 (e.g., 2-3 mm greater than<br>
the thickness 53). The insulator 52 may include an air gap that extends<br>
between the chassis 36 and the copper layer 50 on the lower side of the<br>
ceramic core 48 of the DBC substrate 44. As such, in the embodiment<br>
depicted in FIG. 3, the module stack 38 is insulated from the chassis 36. It<br>
should also be noted that the embodiment shown in FIG. 3 does not include a<br><br>
chassis 36 may be made of a metal, such as aluminum, and although not<br>
shown may form a frame around various other components of the inverter 24,<br>
such as a capacitor assembly that includes a set, or sets, of conductive plates,<br>
in a spaced relationship and wound into coils to form a capacitor, or multiple<br>
capacitors, as in commonly understood.<br>
 The module stack 38 is connected to the housing 34 and includes a<br>
direct, or double, bonded copper (DBC) substrate 44 and an electronic<br>
component, or microelectronic die 46. The DBC substrate 44 includes a<br>
ceramic core 48 and two copper layers 50 formed on opposing sides (i.e.,<br>
upper and lower) of the ceramic core 48. The microelectronic die 46 includes<br>
a semiconductor substrate (e.g., silicon substrate) with an integrated circuit<br>
formed thereon that includes one or more of the switches 33 (e.g., power<br>
electronic switches) shown in FIG. 2 in the form of individual semiconductor<br>
devices, such as insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs), as is commonly<br>
understood. The microelectronic die 46 is mounted to the copper layer 50 on<br>
the upper side of the ceramic core 48 of the DBC substrate 44 with solder 51. In the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 3, the module stack 38 is<br>
positioned in a spaced relationship from the chassis 36 with an insulator (or<br>
insulating region) 52 having a thickness 53 formed therebetween. In one<br>
embodiment, the thickness 53 of the insulator 52 is at least 1 millimeter (mm),<br>
such as between 1 mm and 125 mm. The module stack 38 may be positioned<br>
such that the microelectronic die 46 lies a distance 54 from the chassis 36 that<br>
is greater than the thickness 53 of the insulator 52 (e.g., 2-3 mm greater than<br>
the thickness 53). The insulator 52 may include an air gap that extends<br>
between the chassis 36 and the copper layer 50 on the lower side of the<br>
ceramic core 48 of the DBC substrate 44. As such, in the embodiment<br>
depicted in FIG. 3, the module stack 38 is insulated from the chassis 36. It<br>
should also be noted that the embodiment shown in FIG. 3 does not include a<br><br>
heat sink or cold plate. In particular, the inverter 24 does not include a heat<br>
sink interconnecting the chassis 36 and the module stack 38. Still referring to FIG. 3, the atomizer 40 (i.e., a cooling<br>
mechanism) is connected to the housing 34 within the module chamber 42<br>
(and is electrically insulated from the chassis 36) and positioned above the<br>
module stack 38, and more particularly, above the microelectronic die 46. The<br>
atomizer 40 includes a nozzle 56 that is directed towards the microelectronic<br>
die 46, and although not specifically illustrated, is in fluid communication<br>
with the radiator 26, through the pump 32, shown in FIG. 1. During operation, still referring to FIG. 1, the vehicle 10 is<br>
operated by providing power to the wheels 16 with the combustion engine 28<br>
and the electric motor 30 in an alternating manner and/or with the combustion<br>
engine 28 and the electric motor 30 simultaneously. In order to power the<br>
electric motor 30, DC power is provided from the battery 22 to the inverter<br>
assembly 24, which converts the DC power into AC power, before the power<br>
is sent to the electric motor 30. As will be appreciated by one skilled in the<br>
art, the conversion of DC power to AC power is substantially performed by<br>
operating (i.e., repeatedly switching) the switches 33 (i.e., transistors) shown<br>
in FIG. 2.<br>
 With continued reference to FIG. 3, as the inverter 24 is operated,<br>
heat is generated by the semiconductor devices (i.e., transistors) within the<br>
microelectronic die 46. In one embodiment, the die 46 generates a heat flux<br>
density of at least 10 W/cm2. In order to remove heat from the<br>
microelectronic die 46, the fluid within the radiator 26 is circulated by the<br>
pump 32 (FIG. 1) to the atomizer 40 within the inverter 24. The fluid is<br>
sprayed through the nozzle 56 onto the microelectronic die 46. Heat from the<br>
microelectronic die 46 conducts to the fluid before the fluid runs off of the<br>
microelectronic die 46. The fluid may then fall from the module stack 38 to<br><br>
be collected and returned to the radiator 26, by the pump 32, to be cooled<br>
within the cooling channels of the radiator 26.<br>
 Still referring to FIG. 3, as the microelectronic die 46 is operated,<br>
due to the lack of direct connection and the air gap, as well as the relatively<br>
large distance between the module stack 38 (or the microelectronic die 46) and<br>
the chassis 36, the capacitance 58 between the microelectronic die 46 and the<br>
chassis 36 is minimized.<br>
 FIG. 4 illustrates the inverter 24, according to another embodiment.<br>
Similarly to inverter 24 shown in FIG. 3, the inverter 24 includes a housing<br>
34, a chassis 36, a module stack 38, and an atomizer 40. However, the<br>
inverter 24 shown in FIG. 4 also includes a sump 60 (i.e., a fluid collection<br>
mechanism) that interconnects the chassis 36 and the module stack 38. The<br>
sump 60 includes a passageway therethrough that is in fluid communication<br>
with the pump 32 shown in FIG. 1. The sump 60 also includes openings 62<br>
through an upper side thereof and adjacent to the passageway and is made of<br>
an insulating material, such as molded plastic.<br>
 As shown, the module stack 38 is mounted to the sump 60, and the<br>
atomizer 40 is connected to the housing 34 above the module stack 38. Also<br>
similar to the embodiment shown in FIG. 3, the sump 60 forms an insulator (or<br>
insulating region) 52 between the module stack 38 and the chassis 36. The<br>
thickness 53 of the sump 60 may vary depending on the particular materials of<br>
which the sump 60 is made. It should again be noted that the embodiment<br>
shown in FIG. 4 does not include a heat sink, particularly interconnecting the<br>
module stack 38 and the chassis 36.<br>
 During operation, in a manner similar to that described above, fluid<br>
from the radiator 26 is sprayed from the atomizer 40 onto the microelectronic<br>
die 46 to remove heat from the microelectronic die 46. After the fluid falls<br>
from the module stack 38, the fluid drains from the module chamber 42<br><br>
through the openings 62 and into the passageway in the sump 60. The fluid<br>
then flows through the passageway in the sump 60 and is returned to the<br>
radiator 26.<br>
 Still referring to FIG. 4, as the microelectronic die 46 is operated,<br>
due to the lack of conductive components, such as a heat sink, between the<br>
module stack 38 (or the microelectronic die 46) and the chassis 36, the<br>
capacitance 58 between the microelectronic die 46 and the chassis 36 is<br>
minimized.<br>
 FIG. 5 illustrates the inverter 24, according to a further<br>
embodiment. Similarly to the inverters 24 shown in FIGS. 3 and 4, the<br>
inverter 24 of FIG. 5 includes a housing 34, a chassis 36, and a module stack<br>
38. However, the inverter 24 shown in FIG. 5 also includes a "floating" heat<br>
sink 70 and a base plate 72. The floating heat sink 70 is connected to the<br>
housing 34 and positioned in a spaced relationship from the chassis 36 with<br>
the insulator (or insulating region) 52 being formed therebetween. The<br>
floating heat sink 70 is made of a conductive material, such as aluminum, and<br>
includes a passageway 74 therethrough that is in fluid communication with the<br>
pump 32 shown in FIG. 1. Although not shown in detail, in one embodiment,<br>
the base plate 72 includes a metal plate with a layer of solder on an upper<br>
surface thereof that interconnects the metal plate and the module stack 38 and<br>
a layer of thermal grease on a lower surface thereof that interconnects the<br>
metal plate and the floating heat sink 70. The floating heat sink 70 may be<br>
positioned such that the microelectronic die 46 lies a distance 76 from the<br>
chassis 36 of, for example, at least 100 mm, such as between 100 and 150 mm.<br>
The insulator 52 may include an air gap that extends between the chassis 36<br>
and the floating heat sink 70.<br><br>
 During operation, heat generated by the microelectronic die 46<br>
conducts through the DBC substrate 44 and the base plate 72 and into the<br>
floating heat sink 70. Fluid from the radiator 26 is circulated through the<br>
passageway 74 in the floating heat sink 70 to absorb the heat conducted from<br>
the microelectronic die 46.<br>
 Still referring to FIG. 5, as the microelectronic die 46 is operated,<br>
due to the lack of direct connection and the air gap, as well as the relatively<br>
large distance, between the module stack 38 (or the microelectronic die 46)<br>
and the chassis 36, the capacitance 58 between the microelectronic die 46 and<br>
the chassis 36 is minimized.<br>
 One advantage of the various embodiments described above is that<br>
because of the reduced capacitance between the chassis and the<br>
microelectronic die, capacitive coupling between the die and the chassis is<br>
reduced, as is any electromagnetic interference caused by the operation of the<br>
die. Thus, the performance on the inverter is improved. As a result, the<br>
likelihood that Y-capacitors will have to be installed at the input of the<br>
inverter 24 is reduced, thereby reducing the manufacturing costs of the<br>
inverter.<br>
 Other embodiments may combine the features shown separated in<br>
FIGS. 3, 4, and 5. For example, the air gap shown in FIGS. 3 and 5 may be<br>
combined with the sump 60 shown in FIG. 4 to provide an inverter with an<br>
insulating body (i.e., the sump 60) and an air gap between the chassis 36 and<br>
the microelectronic die 46. The power inverter may also be utilized the in<br>
different types of automobiles, or in different electrical systems altogether.<br><br>
