Circuit description:<br>
Timer is a very popular integrated circuit, which is used, in both the analog and digital circuit. This timer IC can be used for both the monostable and astable models. Here, we are using as monostable model. It will take the input as low state and generate the output as high.<br>
A monostable multivibrators using Timer IC as shown in Fig. 1, is a basic circuit. A monostable multivibrator has only one stable state. The output during this stable state is low (about OV or ground). This can be identified by LED, which will not glow at this time. When the computer software triggers the circuit, then the output goes high for a predetermined time, which depends on the RC-time constant. During the above time LED will glow. After this time the output retums to its stable state, once triggered, the monostable multivibrator will not respond to any other input trigger pulse until it has completed it's predetermined timing cycle. The input signal or the trigger pulse is applied at pin no. 2. The trigger signal passed from the software to circuit via parallel port strobe pin.L The reset pin no. 4 is connected, together with the pin no. 8 to +VCC and printer port 3. The threshold pin no. 6 and the discharge pin no. 7 are connected together to +VCC through a PTCR. An extemal capacitor pin no. 5 is connected to ground through a capacitor C2. The output is available at pin no.3 and it is connect to the printer port pin no. 11.<br>
At the start of the cycle the output remains low and the capacitor CI remains discharged. When a negative moving pulse is applied at pin no. 2 then the output becomes high and the capacitor CI starts charging towards +VCC. When the voltage at pin no. 6 becomes 2/3 VCC then the output becomes low and capacitor CI is discharged. Width of the output pulse is given by the following formula.<br><br>
T=l.l(RlxCl)<br>
Where T = Time in seconds, Rl = Resistance in ohms and CI = Capacitance in Farads. For better performance the values of PTCR should be kept between lOOK and lOM.<br>
While, value of CI should be kept between lOOPF and lOOMF.<br>
Referring to the figure. 1, The content of dotted block are actually housed in a wooden Box. It has six terminals ( LVcc ,2.Gnd,3.Input trigger, 4.Pulse output, 5.Input to the thermistor, 6. Output from the thermistor).<br>
The Wooden Box wire number wbl is connected to the parallel port of computer pin no3. The box wire number wb2 is connected to the paralle port pin no. 18. The Box wire number wb3 connected to parallel port of pin no.ll. Similarly wire wb4 is connected to pin 11. The box wire no 5 &amp; 6 are connected to the input and output of the PTCR.<br>
The working principle of this device is that a signal is sent to the interface device from the computer through parallel port pin nol. The circuit is enabled and it will give a output pulse and the output signal is send to the computer through the parallel port pin no.ll. Using specialized system software (This explained in detail in algorithm and the flowchart) these signals are measured and the equivalent temperature is displayed.<br><br>
Printer port pin details:<br>
This section gives printer port pin details and it will help us to understand the details about pins we used for our circuit interface. A standard PC provides for three printer ports at the following base address:<br>
LPTl =       OX0378   OR  0X03BC LPT2=       0X0278  OR 0X0378 LPTl =       OX 0278<br>
In our module LPTl is at 0 x 0378 the printer port has three 8-bit registers:<br><br><br><br>
Pin 18-25 are connected to ground of computer circuit. In our circuit input trigger is connected to the strobe signal in pin no.l. The circuit output will be connected to busy signal pin no. 11 and the circuit ground is connected to ground signal pin no. 18. The circuit VCC will be connected to pin no.3.<br>
Fig,2. Block diagram of major components of computerized thermometer<br>
Referring figure no.2, It is a block diagram of the overall system. It consists of a PC, an interface circuit, and transducer (Positive Temperature Coefficient Resistance). The atmosphere heat is observed by the transducer and according to that the resistance of the transducer will vary.<br>
Where in Fig. 2 different components denotes as follows,<br>
PC - Any configured computer<br>
ID - Interface Circuit<br>
PTCR -  Positive temperature co-efficient resistance<br><br>
Whenever PC wants to display the temperature it will trigger the Interface circuit by strobe signal. Interface circuit will responds to the computer with output signal based on the PTCR resistance. At the same time software will listen at the busy port 11. And calculate the time taken between trigger and complete response. Based on this time interval temperature will be displayed.<br>
Fig, 3, Architectural context diagram<br>
Referring figure. 3, It is the Architecture context diagram of overall<br>
system. Here ii,i2	in are the different temperature input to the PTCR. ri is<br>
the resistance which depends upon input ij , pi is the power signal of the circuit given to the computer parallel port, with respect to ri , I is the interface circuit. Q is the temperature output display of the computer.<br>
Where as in Fig. 3 different components denotes as follows, PTCR - Positive Temperature Co-efficient Resistance PC - Any computer with parallel port I   - Interface circuit<br>
i1, i2	in - Are different atmospheric temperature situation kept for PTCR<br>
ri - Resistance value of PTCR when atmospheric temperature is ii<br>
Pi - Power signal of circuit given to computer this duration will depend on the<br>
value of resistance.<br>
Φ(.) -  System software functions which handle sending trigger to circuit and<br>
getting output signal from circuit and display the temperature.<br><br>
T    - Threshold resistance value for the system software is IK ohms.   If the resistance value in Kilo ohms then time difference is high so that accuracy will be more. Q - The output temperature displayed in monitor<br>
Where as in the mathematical notation, Based on figure.3, ii a ri a pi a Q  (a means proportionate)<br>
This equitation means. If the input temperature changes then resistance is changing, If resistance is changing the length of the output pulse changes. So, Output temperature also changes.<br>
Fig. 4. Method of computing temperature in computerized thermometer<br>
C is High-level computer programming language, it is used for calculating the pulse length given by the circuit and display the temperature and maintain the database in milliseconds with the corresponding temperature used in software. The following algorithm will explain how the software is displaying the temperature. Initially, for the first round the number of millisecond associated with number of centigrade is fed to the computer manually. Based on the first time data software will display the temperature in centigrade. Figure. 4 gives list of steps performed in the C program.<br><br>
