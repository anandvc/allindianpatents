Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention generally relates to mounting connector jacks<br>
to facilitate connection of communications circuits.<br>
Background<br>
In broadcast communications equipment installations, such as in a<br>
studio or production facility, it is common to have patch panels to interconnect a<br>
variety of signal sources with a variety of downstream processing, recording and<br>
broadcast equipment. These patch panels may mount jacks in paired combinations<br>
to provide input and output circuits to each piece of equipment. Also, these paired<br>
arrangements may include a single jack connected to a monitor circuit mounted<br>
adjacent to the jack pairs. Depending on the size and complexity of the installation,<br>
these patch panels may have a single paired set of jacks or may include many paired<br>
sets in a dense configuration. Other installation may include a single jack when<br>
patching with jack pairs is not required or for connecting to monitor circuits in a<br>
location separate from the patching jack pairs.<br>
Some of the paired jacks may be combined into a switching jack<br>
pair while other pairs may be two straight through jacks mounted adjacent each<br>
other. The jack pairs in a switching jack may have a rigid housing about them to<br>
contain both of the jacks of the pair as well as the switching circuitry between the<br>
jacks. U.S. Patent No. 5,885,096 shows an example switching jack. This rigid<br>
housing also provides support to the jacks themselves and helps to prevent<br>
deflection of the jacks. Individual straight through jacks mounted adj acent one<br>
another in pairs do not share such a housing. Strain from the cables attached to the<br>
jacks may cause the jacks to deflect. In some cases, the jacks deflect enough to<br>
come into contact with each other or other adjacently mounted jacks.<br>
Improvements to the jacks are desirable.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to jacks for receiving plugs to<br>
electrically connect communications circuits. A modular housing provides support<br>
to jack assemblies mounted within the housings.<br><br>
More specifically, the present invention relates to a coaxial<br>
connection assembly including a coaxial jack with a conductive outer shell with a<br>
first end and a second opposite end. The first end defines a front coaxial jack<br>
including an insulator mounted within an axial opening of the outer shell and a<br>
center conductor mounted within the insulator. The second end defines a rear<br>
coaxial jack including an insulator mounted within an axial opening of the outer<br>
shell and a center conductor mounted within the insulator. The center conductors of<br>
the front and rear jacks are electrically connected. The jack assembly is positioned<br>
within a longitudinal opening of a housing. The first end of the jack assembly<br>
extends through a first end of the housing and the second end of the jack assembly<br>
extends through a second end of the housing. The longitudinal opening of the<br>
housing includes a key which cooperates with the outer shell of the jack to prevent<br>
rotation of the jack assembly within the opening. The opening also includes a stop<br>
which positions the jack assembly within the opening. The housing includes a<br>
mounting flange extending away from the longitudinal opening adjacent the first end<br>
of the housing, with the mounting flange including an opening for receiving a<br>
fastener.<br>
The present invention further relates to a jack pair comprising first<br>
and second jack assemblies, each jack assembly including a first coaxial connector<br>
end and a second coaxial connector end, each of the connector ends adapted to<br>
receive and electrically mate with a coaxial connector. First and second housings<br>
each define a longitudinal opening configured to position one of the jack assemblies<br>
within the opening. The housing's are identically configured. The opening of each<br>
housing slidably receives one of the jack assemblies through the first end. The<br>
opening of each housing cooperates with the jack assembly within the opening to<br>
prevent rotation of the jack assembly. The opening of each housing also limits the<br>
extent of insertion of the jack assembly through the first end of the housing and<br>
removal of the jack assembly through the second end of the housing is prevented.<br>
Each housing further includes an outer face with a longitudinal ridge and a<br>
longitudinal groove. The ridge and the groove of the first housing are slidably<br>
received within the groove and ridge of the second housing. Each of the housings<br>
further include a mounting flange with an opening for receiving a fastener opposite<br>
the outer face adj acent the first end of each housing.<br><br>
Still further the present invention relates to a method of assembling a<br>
jack pair. The method includes providing first and second coaxial jack assemblies<br>
and first and second housings. Each housing includes a longitudinal opening with a<br>
first end and a second end. Each housing also includes a first face including a ridge<br>
and a groove, and the housings are identically configured. The first jack assembly is<br>
slidably inserted within the opening of the first housing and a guide slot of the jack<br>
assembly engages a guide within the opening. The first jack assembly is positioned<br>
within the first housing with a first connector end extending from a first end of the<br>
housing and a second connector end extending from a second end of the housing.<br>
The second jack assembly is similarly positioned within the opening of the second<br>
housing. The first housing is mounted to the second housing along the first face<br>
with the ridge of each housing slidably received within the groove of the other<br>
housing.<br><br>

Detailed Description<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to exemplary aspects of the<br>
present invention which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever<br>
possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer<br>
to the same or like parts.<br>
Patch panels such as a panel 10 in FIG. 1, might be installed in<br>
broadcast communications production facilities. Patch panels 10 include a chassis<br>
16	including a mounting frame 17 and apanel front 18 with a plurality of pairs of<br>
openings 20. As shown, panel front 18 may be removed from frame 17 to allow<br>
different configuration's of openings 20 to be included in panel 10. As shown, frame<br>
17	is made of a durable material such as aluminum or steel to provide structural<br>
support to chassis 16. Other similar structural materials may be used for frame 17<br>
such as other durable or rigid metals or composite materials. Panel front 18 is<br>
molded or formed from plastic or other similar non-conductive material to facilitate<br>
the creation of the more complex features of panel front 18 for mounting a variety of<br>
devices to chassis 16. A pair of opposing mounting flanges 22 are on either side of<br>
frame 17 to facilitate mounting panel 10 to a communications equipment rack or<br>
other mounting structure in broadcast facility. Flanges 22 include openings 24 for<br>
receiving fasteners to secure panel 10 to the rack or mounting structure.<br>
Jacks pairs 26,28,128 and 228 for connecting communication<br>
circuits are mounted to a rear of panel front 18. Each of these jack pairs include a<br>
front set of connectors accessible though one of the openings 20 in panel front 18<br>
and a rear set of connectors accessible from the rear of panel 10.<br><br>
The jack pairs as shown include prior art switching jack pairs 26 and<br>
straight through jack pairs 28,128 and 228. All of these jack pairs include a pair of<br>
rear connectors 30 for linking to communications cables extending behind panel 10<br>
and a pair of front connectors 32 for connecting to communications cables extending<br>
in front of panel 10. Switching pair 26 provides internal circuitry so that without a<br>
plug inserted within either front connector 32, an electrical path is defined between<br>
the pair of rear connectors 30. No such circuitry is provided in straight through pairs<br>
28,128 and 228. U.S. Patent No. 5,885,096, the disclosure of which is incorporated<br>
herein by reference, discloses a switching jack pair similar to switching jack pairs<br>
26.<br>
Jack pairs 28,128 and 228 include a pair of housings 46, a long jack<br>
assembly or jack 48 or 148 and a short jack assembly or jack 50 or 150. Within each<br>
housing 46 is mounted one of the jack assemblies 48 or 148 and one of the jack<br>
assemblies 50 or 150. Jack pairs 28,128 and 228, housing 46 and jacks 48,148, 50<br>
and 150 will be described in further detail below.<br>
Referring now to FIGS. 2 and 3, an alternative embodiment patch<br>
panel 110 is shown. Panel 110 is similar to panel 10 in construction but includes a<br>
third row of openings 20 in a panel front 118 to which may be mounted monitor<br>
jacks 34. Panel front 118 is mounted in a frame 117. Monitor jack 34 also includes<br>
rear connector 30 and front connector 32 and these connectors 30 and 32 maybe the<br>
same format as those of the adjacently mounted pairs 26 and 28. On a rear face 119<br>
of panel front 118, a pair of fastener openings 36 are positioned adjacent each of the<br>
openings 20 in the monitor row and adjacent each pair of openings 20 for mounting<br>
pairs 26 and 28. Openings 36 each receive a fastener of a jack pair 26,28,128 or<br>
228 or a monitor jack 34 to mount these devices to panel front 118. Similar<br>
openings 36 are also positioned on the rear of panel front 18 of panel 10. Panel front<br>
118 is removably mounted to frame 117 to permit the configuration of openings 20<br>
and 36 of panel 110 to be changed.<br>
Extending rearward from frame 117 adjacent panel front 118 and<br>
mounting flanges 22 are a pair of sides 38. A tie-off bar 40 extends between the two<br>
sides 38 and provides a convenient location to tie-off cables extending to the rear<br>
connectors 30 of each of the jack pairs or monitor jacks. A similar structure of sides<br>
38 and rear tie-off bar 40 may be added to panel 10.<br><br>
As shown in FIGS. 1 to 3, rear connectors 30 are coaxial cable<br>
connectors for receiving standard coaxial BNC connectors. Others sizes and styles<br>
of coaxial connectors may be used as well. Front connectors 32 are coaxial cable<br>
connectors for connecting to standard size or mid size video-plugs. Other sizes and<br>
styles of coaxial connectors adapted to receive video plugs may be used as well. It<br>
is also anticipated that panels 10 and 110 are not limited to use in a broadcast<br>
communications environment but may also be adapted for use in other<br>
telecommunications installations where coaxial cable connections are required.<br>
As can be seen in FIGS. 1 to 3, rear connectors 30 may be staggered<br>
either horizontally or vertically to improve access to adjacent connectors. This<br>
staggering also permits a greater density of jack pairs 26 and 28 and monitor jacks<br>
34 to mounted to panel 10 or 110. Alternatively, rear connectors 30 could be non-<br>
staggered where access and density of installation are not as great a concern.<br>
Referring now to FIGS. 4 and 5, a grouping of jack pairs 26 and 28<br>
and monitor jacks 34 mounted to rear 19 of panel front 18 of panel 110 is shown.<br>
Monitor jacks 34 are mounted to openings 20 in a monitor row 42. Jack pairs 26<br>
and 28 are mounted in pairs of openings 20 in a row 44. Monitor 34 includes a<br>
housing 46 and either a long jack 48 or a short jack 50 mounted within an opening in<br>
housing 46.<br>
FIGS. 5A and 5B show a third panel 210 with a single row of<br>
openings 20 with a single adjacent row of mounting openings 36. Individual jacks<br>
234 including jack assemblies 50 mounted within a single housing 46, similar to<br>
monitor jack 34, may be mounted to panel 210. Panel 210 may provide a separate<br>
row of monitor circuits to match up with patching circuits such as shown in panel 10<br>
of FIG. 1. Alternatively, jacks and housings may be mounted to panel 210 to<br>
provide patching or circuit connections where the number of circuits is relatively<br>
smaller and fewer jack assemblies are needed. Frame 217 includes mounting<br>
flanges 22 with openings 24 for mounting panel 210. Mounted to panel front 218 is<br>
a plurality of single j acks 234, which may be monitor j acks 34 but may also be<br>
individual patching jacks.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 6, a module 54 including three jack pairs 28<br>
mounted to a mounting block 52 is shown. Such a module might be used when a<br>
smaller number of patching jacks are required for a particular installation.<br>
Alternatively, module 54 might be used with a patch panel including a front face<br><br>
adapted to receive and mount a plurality of modules 54 in a density similar to that of<br>
panels 10 and 110, above.<br>
FIGS. 7 and 8 show module 54 of FIG. 6 is an exploded view. Also<br>
shown in FIG. 8 is the interconnection between housings 46 of each jack pair 28.<br>
Housings 46 are identical housings which mate with each other along a face 56.<br>
Face 56 includes a ridge 58 and groove 60. Housing 46 also includes a mounting<br>
flange 62 positioned adjacent a first end 64. Ridge 58 and groove 60 are positioned<br>
and configured so that the ridge and groove of a first housing 46 cooperate with the<br>
groove and ridge, respectively, of a second housing 46 when the first and second<br>
housings 46 are positioned with faces 56 and first ends 64 adjacent each other.<br>
Ridge 58 and groove 60, and the nature of their cooperation are described in further<br>
detail below.<br>
Within an opening in mounting flange 62 of housing 46 is a captive<br>
fastener such as a screw 66. Screw 66 engages opening 36 of mounting block 52<br>
and of panel front 18 to removably mount a housing 46, a monitor jack 34 or a jack<br>
pair 28. As shown in the FIGS., screw 66 is a captive screw and remains with<br>
housing 46 when disengaged from opening 36. It is anticipated that other captive<br>
fasteners may be used with housing 46, such as quarter-turn fasteners and similar<br>
fasteners.<br>
FIGS. 9 to 14 illustrate jack pair 28. Referring now specifically to<br>
FIG. 10, housing 46 includes an opening 68 for receiving captive screw 66 in flange<br>
62. Screw 66 includes threads which extend through first end 64, as shown in FIGS.<br>
7 and 8, above. Housing 46 also defines a longitudinal opening 70 extending from<br>
first end 64 to a second end 72. Jacks 48 and 50 are received within opening 70<br>
through first end 64 so that rear connectors 30 extend through and beyond second<br>
end 72. Adjacent front connector 32 of both jacks 48 and 50 is a grounding housing<br>
74. Within grounding housing 74 is circuitry to permit a center conductor 84 (see<br>
FIG. 12) of jack 48 or 50 to make electrical contact with and ground to an outer<br>
conductive shell 86 (see FIG. 12). An insulator 85 electrical isolates center<br>
conductor 84 from outer shell 86 except as the circuitry may ground the two to each<br>
other. Opening 70 includes an enlarged portion 76 adjacent first end 64 for<br>
receiving housing 74. Enlarged portion 76 does not extend through opening 70 to<br>
second end 72 and ends at an intermediate bulkhead 78.<br><br>
Adjacent rear connectors 30 of jacks 48 and 50 are a pair of opposed<br>
bayonets 80 for releasably securing a BNC cable connector to rear connector 30.<br>
Each jack 48 and 50 also includes a pair of opposed guide or key slots 82. Each slot<br>
82 includes a closed end 88 and an open end 90. Key slots 82 are oriented parallel<br>
to the main axis of jacks 48 and 50 with closed end 88 toward the front connector 32<br>
and open end 90 toward rear connector 30. Key slots 82 are located between<br>
grounding housing 74 and rear connector 30.<br>
 FIG. 14 shows the cooperating shaes of ridge 58 and groove 60.<br>
Ridge 58 includes a dovetail shape when viewed from first end 64 or from second<br>
end 72. Groove 60 includes a mating shape for receiving the dovetail shape of ridge<br>
58. Further details of these shapes are described below with regard to FIGS. 33 and<br>
34.<br>
Referring now to FIGS. 15 to 18, one half of jack pair 28 is shown,<br>
including shorter jack 50. As enlarged portion 76 of opening 70 of housing 46<br>
extends beyond mounting flange 62 toward bulkhead 78, an open top 96 is formed,<br>
through which grounding housing 74 is visible. This open top allows maximum<br>
room for housing 74 without impeding access to screw 66. Between bulkhead 78<br>
and second end 72 of housing 46, a pair of opposing guides or keys 92 are formed in<br>
the top and bottom of opening 70 to engage key slots 82 of jack 50 (and also of jack<br>
48). Keys 92 and key slots 82 cooperate to orient jack 50 (and also jack 48) within<br>
housing 46. Bayonets 80 and key slots 82 are offset from each other about jack 50<br>
and with keys 92 engaged in key slots 82, bayonets 80 are oriented horizontally.<br>
Also within opening.70 are opposing bayonet slots 94. Opening 70 is<br>
smaller in dimension than the width of bayonets 80. Bayonet slots 94 allow rear<br>
 connector 30 to be inserted through first end 64 and extend through opening 70 <br>
beyond second end 72. Bayonet slots 94 also orient jack 50 so that key slots 82 are<br>
correctly oriented to engage keys 92 through open ends 90. When jack 50 is fully<br>
inserted and correctly positioned within housing 46, keys 92 adjacent bulkhead 78<br>
engage closed ends 88 of key slots 82, and prevent further insertion of jack 50.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 15 to 18, jacks 48 and 50 each include grounding<br>
housing 74. An alternative embodiment jack pair 128 includes jacks 148 and 150,<br>
which do not include grounding housing 74, is shown in FIGS. 19 to 21. In other<br>
respects, jack pair 128 is similar to jack pair 28. For jacks 48, 50,148 and 150, key<br>
92 engaging closed end 88 of key slot 82 defines the limit of insertion within<br><br>
housings 46. While jacks 148 and 150 do not require enlarged portion 76 of opening<br>
70, housing 46 is configured to be compatible with multiple types and styles of jacks<br>
48, 50,148 and 150, as well as other types and styles which may or may not include<br>
a grounding housing or another enlarged portion adjacent front connector 32.<br>
FIGS. 22 to 27 illustrate a further alternative embodiment jack pair<br>
228, with front connectors 32 configured to receive a mid-size video coaxial plug.<br>
In other respects, jack pair 228 is similar to jack pair 128 of FIGS. 19 to 21 and to<br>
jack pair 28 of FIGS. 9 to 14.<br>
FIG. 28 shows prior art switching jack pair 26, including front<br>
connectors 32 configured to receive standard size video plugs and rear connectors 30<br>
configured to receive BNC plugs. A pair of mounting flanges 162 extend from<br>
opposing sides of a housing 146. Flanges 162 including openings 68 for receiving a<br>
captive fastener such as screw 66, shown in FIGS. 16 to 19, above. Openings 68 are<br>
positioned so that fasteners within openings 68 may engage openings 36 of panel<br>
front 18 or mounting block 52. As shown in FIGS. 1 to 5, above, jack pairs 26,28,<br>
128 and 128, may all be mounted to panel front 18 as part of patch panel 10 or 110,<br>
or as shown in FIGS. 6 to 8, to mounting block 52 as part of module 54.<br>
FIGS. 29 to 34 show housing 46 in further detail. A ledge 100<br>
extends within opening 70 from bulkhead 78 to first end 64 and defines the<br>
transition from opening 70 to enlarged portion 76. Ledge 100 also cooperates with<br>
bayonet slot 94 to permit bayonets 80 of rear connector 30 to extend through<br>
opening 70 in an appropriate orientation for key slot 82 to engage key 92. Keys 92<br>
extend from second end 72 to bulkhead 78 and define an end wall 98 at bulkhead 78.<br>
End wall 98 engages closed end 88 of key slot 82 to define a stop. This stop sets the<br>
maximum extent that a jack assembly may be inserted within housing 46.<br>
FIGS. 33 and 34 show groove 60 and ridge 58, respectively, in<br>
further detail. Ridge 58 includes an outer face 114 defining a maximum width 102<br>
at an offset distance 112 from face 56 of housing 46. Ridge 58 narrows as it<br>
approaches face 56 to a minimum width of 104 adjacent face 56. Groove 60<br>
includes an inner face 118 defining a maximum width 106 at inset distance 116 from<br>
face 56. Groove 60 narrows as it approaches face 56 to a minimum width 108<br>
adjacent face 56. Ridge 58 and groove 60 are sized so that width 102 fits within<br>
width 106 with face 114 adjacent face 118, and width 104 fits within width 108.<br>
Distances 112 and 116 are generally equal so that when faces 56 of a pair of<br><br>
cooperating housings 46 are adjacent, face 114 is adjacent face 118. Other similar<br>
cooperating shapes may be used for ridge 58 and groove 60 provided they join two<br>
identical housing to each other as shown for a jack pair 28,128 or 228. This joining<br>
is accomplished by sliding the housing together longitudinally while preventing the<br>
housings from being pulled apart transversely.<br>
The cooperation of the dovetail shape of the cooperating ridge 58 and<br>
groove 60 provide several advantages. First, these shapes tie together two housings<br>
46 to form ahousing for two jacks in a jack pair, such as jacks 48,50,148 and 150.<br>
The same housing 46 may be used to hold a single jack, such as shown in monitor<br>
jack 34. This reduces the number of different housings that must be produced and<br>
maintained in inventory. Secondly, the dovetail configuration locks two housings<br>
together while allowing sliding movement in a longitudinal direction. No additional<br>
fasteners for connecting the two housings 46 are required. Screws 66 of each<br>
housing 46 may then be used to mount housings 46 in a module 54 or a panel 10 or<br>
110.<br>
Housings 46 provide an electrically insulative sleeve about a tubular<br>
jack such as jacks 48, 50,148 and 150 and also provide mechanical support to the<br>
 jack to resist deflection due to strain from cables attached to rear connectors 30,<br>
when the cable exerts a force an angle to the jacks. Panel 110 provides a tie off bar<br>
40 to help reduce the strain that1 a cable might exert on a jack. Panel 10 does not<br>
include such a feature and thus cables attached to a rear connector 30 and hanging<br>
directly downward from rear connector 30 may exert an angled force on the jack.<br>
Cables may also be pulled toward the side or top. Housing 46 is attached to panel<br>
front 18 by fastener 66 with first end 64 against rear face 19, as shown in FIGS. 1 to<br>
5. For either jack pair 28 or for monitor jack 34, this arrangement allows housing 46<br>
to provide additional support to resist such transverse forces. The resistance of<br>
transverse forces and the insulative sleeve of housing 46 reduce the likelihood that.<br>
jacks 48 and 50 or 148 and 150 of a jack pair can be deflected enough to electrically<br>
contact each other and cause a short circuit between the two outer insulative shells<br>
86. Housing 46 also provides support against the jacks being deflected enough to<br>
permanently deform or break the jacks.<br>
Referring now to FIGS. 35 to 37, jack assembly 48 is shown in<br>
greater detail. A first outer housing 134 includes conductive outer shell 86 of front<br>
connector 32 as well as slot 82. Mounted within first housing 134 is insulator 85<br><br>
within which center conductor 84 is mounted. Insulator 85 supports and isolates<br>
center conductor 84 from shell 86. As shown, insulator 85 is made from two<br>
identical halves or, alternatively, may be made as a single piece insulator. A second<br>
outer housing 132 includes a conductive outer shell 186 of rear connector 30.<br>
Second outer housing 132 includes a knurled end 133 to aid insertion and retention<br>
within first outer housing 134. Mounted within second housing 132 is an insulator<br>
185 within which a center conductor 184 is mounted. Insulator 185 supports and<br>
isolates center conductor 184 from shell 186. As shown, insulator 185 is made from<br>
two identical halves or, alternatively, may be made as a single piece insulator. A<br>
conductive shaft 130 links center conductors 84 and 184.<br>
Referring now to FIGS. 38 to 40, jack assembly 50 is shown in<br>
greater detail. A first outer housing 134 includes conductive outer shell 86 of front<br>
connector 32 as well as slot 82. Mounted within first housing 134 is insulator 85<br>
within which center conductor 84 is mounted. Insulator 85 supports and isolates<br>
center conductor 84 from shell 86. As shown, insulator 85 includes two identical<br>
halves. Alternatively, insulator 85 may be a single piece insulator. A second outer<br>
housing 232 includes a conductive outer shell 186 of rear connector 30. Mounted<br>
within second housing 132 is an insulator 185 within which a center conductor 184<br>
is mounted. Insulator 185 supports and isolates center conductor 184 from shell<br>
186. As shown, insulator 185 includes two identical halves. Alternatively, insulator<br>
85 may be a single piece insulator. A conductive shaft 130 links center conductors<br>
84 and 184.<br>
In both jack assemblies 48 and 50, grounding housing 74 combines<br>
with a flexible conductive contact member 136, a resistor 140, a pad 141 and a block<br>
142 to define a selective termination device 147, as shown in FIGS. 36 and 39.<br>
Terrnination device 147 is mounted.to first housing 134 with a first end 135 of<br>
member 136 extending through an opening 138 to contact center conductor 84. A<br>
second end 137 of member 136 is mounted to block 142 and is in contact with one<br>
end of resistor 140. The other end of resistor 140 is in electrical contact with first<br>
outer housing 134 and conductive outer shell 86. When a mating plug is inserted<br>
within front connector 32, first end 135 of member 136 is displaced and is no longer<br>
in contact with center conductor 84, breaking the termination between center<br>
. it<br>
conductor 84 and shell 86. Termination device 147 is attached to first outer housing<br><br>
132 by depressions 144 of grounding housing 74 engaging depressions 146 of<br>
housing 132.<br>
FIGS. 41 to 43 show jack assembly 148 is greater detail. Jack<br>
assembly 148 does not include a selective termination device. Thus, a first outer<br>
housing 234 differs from first outer housing 134 in that there is no opening<br>
providing access to center conductor 84. Other aspects of jack assembly 148 are<br>
similar to those of jack assembly 48 shown in FIGS. 35 to 37.<br>
FIGS. 44 to 46 show jack assembly 150 is greater detail. Jack<br>
assembly 150 does not include a selective termination device. Thus, a first outer<br>
housing 234 differs from first outer housing 134 in that there is no opening<br>
providing access to center conductor 84. Other aspects of jack assembly 150 are<br>
similar to those of jack assembly 50 shown in FIGS. 38 to 40.<br>
FIG. 47 shows an alternative jack pair 328 with jack 48 and jack 50<br>
inserted within a pair of openings 70 in a unitary housing 346. Housing 346 is<br>
similar to and includes the elements described above with regard to housing 46 with<br>
the exception of first face 56, ridge 58 and groove 60. Housing 346 is a single piece<br>
housing including both openings 70. Housing 346 provides support and strength to<br>
jacks 48, 50,148 and 150 in a manner similar to housings 46, described above.<br>
Housing 346 is also constructed of a non-conductive material to prevent jacks 48<br>
and 50, or 148 and 159, from deflected into contact with each other and creating a<br>
short circuit.<br>

ABSTRACT<br><br>
TITLE "A CO-AXIAL CONNECTION ASSEMBLY WITH JACK PAIR AND A<br>
METHOD OF ASSEMBLING THE JACK PAIR"<br>
The invention relates to a coaxial connection assembly comprises a coaxial jack<br>
(48) with a conductive outer shell (86) with a first end (64) and a second<br>
opposite end (72). The first end (64) defines a front coaxial jack (48) having an<br>
insulator (85) mounted within an axial opening (68) of the outer shell (86) and a<br>
center conductor mounted within the insulator (85). The second end (72) defines<br>
a rear coaxial jack (50) having an insulator mounted within an axial opening (70)<br>
of the outer shell (86) and a center conductor (84) mounted within the insulator.<br>
The center conductors (84) of the front and rear jacks (48,50) are electrically<br>
connected. The jack (28) assembly is positioned within a longitudinal opening<br>
(70) of a housing (46). The first end of the jack assembly extends through a first<br>
end of the housing (46) and the second end of the jack assembly (28) extends<br>
through a second end of the housing (46). The jack assembly (28) may only be<br>
inserted within and removed from the housing (46) through the first end.<br>
Rotation of the jack assembly (28) within the opening is prevented. The housing<br>
comprises amounting flange (62) extending away from the longitudinal opening<br>
(70) adjacent the first end of the housing (46), with the mounting flange (62)<br>
having an opening (68) for receiving a fastener (66).</td>
