				<td>This invention relates to a process for the preparation of bioactivated extract from the medicinal herbs like bittergourd, ganger, turmeric, garlic and mint for use in treating diseases, for example diabetes, cardiac, diseases, hyper—tension, joint pains and respiratory and gastric problems.<br>
Two processes' are as such known for the preparation of herbal extracts. One of the known processes is alcoholic extraction wherein alcohol is used for the extraction purposes. The other process is aqueous extraction in which distillation/boiling process is used.<br>
There are certain disadvantages associated with the said processes. One of the main disadvantage is that the extract comprises only those constituents which are   soluble in alcohol.<br>
Another disadvantage is that the compound which is to be extracted from the herbs may not be extracted  either  by alcoholic process  or  by  boiling<br>
process.<br>
 Yet another disadvantage is that the active compounds which are extracted from the herbs are not stable and they loose their activity.<br>
However, no process is as such known to prepare bioactivated extracts from the herbs in wliich a living organism is used to preserve the extract and to enhance its medicinal properties.<br>
Therefore, the main object of this invention is to propose a novel process for the preparation of bioactivated extract from the herbs thus preventing their medicinal properties. It is useful for treating the diseases as mentioned above.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose a novel process for the preparation of bioactivated extracts from the herbs and which adds to the medicinal qualities of the herbs.<br>
According to this invention, there is provided a process for the preparation of bioactivated extract from medicinal herbs selected from unripe fruit of mordica charantia (bitter gourd), stem of zingiber officinale (ginger), tuberous roots of turmeric, cloves of allium sativum (garlic) comprising the steps of: (a) washing and crushing the said herb; mixing water heated to temperature of 70-90°C in the ratio of 1:2 to 1:20, maintaining the temperature of the mixture at 70-90°C for VA to 4 hours, cooling the mixture to the room temperature followed by filtering the mixture using known methods;<br>
quantity of spores of sacchromyces cerevisiae, keeping the vessel at a temperature of 26-3i°C for a period of 4-6 days such that the atmospheric air does not com© in contact with the contents/filterate, adding a  small amount of potassium metabisulphite into said vessel and stirring the same, keeping said vessel for .1.2—14 days with stirring after a period of every 4 days, decanting off the supernatant liquid and filtering the same, keeping the filtered liquid again for 4-6 days followed by the step of filtration in order to obtain bioac. t.iva ted  extract.<br>
The process is now being described in detail by taking the example of bittergourd as mentioned above. However, this is an exemplary embodiment and should not be treated as restricted to the scope of this invention. The process may be applied to other herbs as mentioned herein above-<br>
In accordance with the process of. this invention the fresh unripe fruits of Momordica charantia (bittergourd) are washed thoroughly and subsequently grated and the seeds are separated. Water is heated to a temperature of 70—90OC separately and poured over grated faittergourd in the ratio of 3-5*1 respectively. The temperature of the mixture is kept at a temperature of 70—90°C for a period of .1 1/2-3 hours. The hot mixture is then allowed to cool and is kept for a period of 12-24 hours. Meanwhile the seeds are ground and boiled water is added to the ground seeds and the mixture is kept for 20-30 hours. Both the mixtures are filtered separately and the filterates are mixed together. Now crystalline sucrose (8.4%) is added to the said mixture in the amount, of 8—10% by weight of the fliterate and is mixed well therewith. The mixture so obtained is transferred into a glass vessel and the vessel is filled completely a small amount of spores of sacchromyces cerevisiae is added into said mixture. The vessel is then kept at a temperature of 26-31°C such that the atmospheric air is not allowed to come in<br><br>
contact with the contents of the vessel. For this purpose a lid having a one way valve is mounted on the mouth of said vessel. The vessel is kept in such condition for a period of 4—6 days and is then stirred. Potassium metabi.su 1 phi te is added in the amount 20—30 parte per million by weight into said vessel and vessel is again kept for 10-14 days. The liquid is stirred every after 4 days. Finally the supernatant liquid is decanted off and filtered. The fiIterate is kept for a further period of 5 days and is.filtered again to get hi oar. tivated extract of hittergourd which is useful for diabetic patients.<br>
The process as described herein above is followed to get extracts of the herbs like ginger, turmeric, and garlic. The process is herein described with the help of the following examples:—<br>
EXAMPLE i_<br>
1 kg fresh unripe fruit of Momordica charantia (bitter gourd) were washed and grated to separate the seeds. Four litres of water was heated to 80 degree Celsius and<br>
poured   over grated Momordica.  The temperature of  the mixture was kept at 800OC for 2 hours and allowed to cool and  kept  for 24 hours.  The seeds of  the  fruit  were ground and      approximately 800 ml of water was added  to it  and  the  mixture was boiled and was   kept  for  24 hours-   Both  the  fractions were  filtered  and  mixed together. It was  approximately 4.5 litres.   280  grams (3.4X)  of  pure crystalline sucrose was added  to  said mixture  and  was mixed  well and was kept  in  a  glass vessel.   The  liquid was filled in   the  glass  vessel almost  completely.  4 grams of spores  of  Sacchromyces cerevisiae  were added to the said vessel.   The  vessel was  kept at a temperature of 26 to 31 degrees  Celsius. The  lid  of  the  vessel has  a  one  way  valve.   The atmospheric air was not allowed to come in contact  with the  liquid.   The vessel was left for 5 days,  and  was stirred and 1.00 mg of potassium metabisulphite was added thereto.   The vessel was stirred again and kept for  12 days  and was stirred every 4 days.  After 12 days   the supernatant  liquid was decanted off and  filtered.  The filtered  liquid  was kept for another 5  days  and  was filtered once again.  The liquid so obtained was  stored at  room temperature in a cool place excluded from  air. The  amount of the filtered liquid was  about 3  litres. The product was found useful for diabetic patients.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
800 grams of zingiher officinale (Ginger) was washed and grated. Two litres of water was boiled and poured over the grated Zingiber officinale which was kept for 12 hours. The mixture was filtered and 2 litres of water was poured over the residue and kept for 24 hours. To the filtrate so obtained 400 grams of crystalline sucrose was added and dissolved well. 4 grams of spores of Sacchromyces cerevisiae were added to said fliterate and kept at 26 to 31 degrees Celsius in a glass vessel excluded from air. The vessel was stirred after 5 days and 100 mg of potassium metabisulphite was added and stirred again. The mixture was kept for another 12 days stirring after every 4 days. After 12 days the clear liquid was siphoned off and filtered- 200 grams sucrose was added to the filtered liquid and was stirred well. The liquid was kept for another week at the same temperature. The clear liquid was decanted off and filtered. The filtered liquid was filled* in the air tight bottles up to the brim and was stored at room temperature. The product was found useful for patients with respiratory problems.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
300 grams fresh tuberous roots of turmeric were grounded coarsely., Though fresh roots are preferred but 250 grams of dried powder can also be used- 4 litres water was added to the ground roots and the temperature was raised to 90°C for 4 hours followed by cooling. 400 grams pure crystalline sucrose was added to the cold mixture and stirred. 4 grams dry sacchromyces cerevisiae was then added to the mixture and stirred well. The vessel was kept at 26 to 31OC. The vessel was stirred after 5 days and 100 mg of potassium metahisulphite was added to it- The vessel was kept for another 7 days and filtered. 200 grams of sucrose was added to the filtrate. The vessel was kept for another 12 days excluded from air stirring every 4 days. The clear liquid was decanted off and filtered well. The filtered liquid was kept for another 5 days which was decanted and filtered. The filtered liquid was storetd in air tight, bottles. It is found useful for patients with cardiar problems and for patients with joint pains.<br>
EXAMPLE A<br>
200 grams cloves of Allium sativum (Garlic) were coarsely crushed. 4 litres hot water at 80 degree celsius was poured over the crushed cloves and the Ipinppr ahirp of 80oC was maintained for 4 hours The mixture was allowed to cool and was filtered after 24 hours. 400 grains of sucrose and 4 grams of dry sarchromyces cerevisiae were added to the filtrate. The filler-ate was poured in a glass vessel. The vessel was kept at 26 to 31oC for 5 days. The mixture was filtered after 5 days. 15® grams sucrose and 100 mg of potassium metabisulphite were added to the liquid and stirred well. The liquid was kept again for 12 days excluded from . air and stirred after every 4 days. The clear liquid was decanted off and filtered. The filtered liquid was kept for another 5 days and decanted and filtered again. The filtered liquid was stored in the air tight bottles. It was found useful for patients with cardiac problems and as an antioxidant.<br>
It has been noted that similar procedure can be used/adopted for mentha arvensis (mint) and for some other medicinal herbs as well.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
