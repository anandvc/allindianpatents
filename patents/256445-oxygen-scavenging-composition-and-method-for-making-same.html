OXYGEN SCAVENGING COMPOSITION AND METHOD FOR MAKING SAME<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a method of scavenging oxygen using polymeric compositions<br>
comprising hydrogenated anthraquinone derivatives, for use in, for example, Food and<br>
beverage packaging to scavenge unwanted oxygen,which either remains within the package,<br>
or otherwise enters the package, following the packaging of the food or beverage. The<br>
hydrogenated anthraquinone derivative may also be incorporated into packaging materials, to<br>
scavenge oxygen which would otherwise have permeated through the packaging material to<br>
enter the inside of a package.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A wide variety of foods, beverages, pharmaceuticals and other materials are susceptible to<br>
significant loss in quality if they are exposed to oxygen during storage. The damage can arise<br>
from, for example, chemical oxidation of the product and/or microbial growth. In the field of<br>
packaging, such damage has been traditionally addressed by generating relatively low-oxygen<br>
atmospheres by vacuum packing and/or inert gas flushing. However, these methods are not<br>
generally applicable for various reasons. For example, the fast filling speeds commonly used<br>
in the food and beverage industries often prevent effective evacuation of, or thorough inert<br>
gas flushing of, food and beverage packages, and neither evacuation or inert gas flushing<br>
provides any residual capacity for removal of oxygen which may have desorbed from the<br>
package contents or entered the package by leakage or permeation. As a consequence, there<br>
has been much Interest in the identification and development of chemical techniques for<br>
generating low-oxygen atmospheres.<br>
In Australian Patent No. 672661 (the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by<br>
reference), the present applicant describes novel oxygen scavenging compositions comprising<br>
a source of labile hydrogen or electrons and a reducible organic compound, which may be<br>
readily activated or "triggered" (ie brought to its oxygen scavenging form) as required by<br>
exposure to, for example, ultraviolet (UV) light. The oxygen scavenging compositions, once<br><br>
activated, are capable of scavenging oxygen from an oxygenated atmosphere or liquid in<br>
substantial darkness for periods ranging from up to a few minutes or hours to over 100 days.<br>
Most of the exemplified oxygen scavenging compositions described in Australian Patent No.<br>
672661, arc based on substituted anthraquinones as the reducible organic compound. Further<br>
examples of substituted anthraquinones suitable for use as the reducible organic compound in<br>
such oxygen scavenging compositions are disclosed in International Patent Application No.<br>
PCT/AU02/00341 (WO 02/076916) (the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by<br>
reference).<br>
There is a general need for alternative compounds and compositions useful for scavenging<br>
oxygen and, in particular, there is a need for compounds and compositions which do not<br>
necessarily require activation subsequent to formation into packaging materials in order to<br>
scavenge oxygen.<br>
In addition, the substituted anthraquinones of the prior art discussed above tend to be coloured<br>
particularly in the reduced states. Compositions and packaging which contain such anthraquinones also tend to be coloured. For instance, films made using anthraquinone-based<br>
compositions can turn a deep yellow colour when the anthraquinone is reduced to activate the<br>
oxygen scavenging capacity. The coloured nature of the anthraquinone-based compositions is<br>
undesirable in many forms of packaging, particularly in the packaging of foodstuffs. It is<br>
therefore desirable, although not essential, that any alternative compounds and compositions<br>
for scavenging oxygen have, in general, substantially less colour than the prior art substituted<br>
anthraquinones.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In a first aspect, the present invention provides a polymeric composition comprising a<br>
hydrogenaled anthraquinone derivative and/or its enol/enolate tautomer or a substituted<br>
derivative thereof.<br><br>
In a second aspect, the present invention provides a method of scavenging oxygen<br>
(particularly ground stale molecular oxygen) in an atmosphere or liquid comprising the steps<br>
of:<br>
(i) providing a polymeric composition according to the first aspect; end<br>
(ii) exposing the atmosphere or liquid to the composition;<br>
such that at least a portion of the oxygen in the atmosphere or liquid is removed through<br>
oxidation of the bydrogenated anthraquinone derivative and/or its enol/enolate tautomer.<br>
In a third aspect, the present invention provides a method of preventing the transmission of oxygen (particularly ground slate molecular oxygen) through a package, said method<br>
comprising forming a package comprising or consisting of a packaging material, said<br>
packaging material comprising a polymeric composition according to the first aspect.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Hydrogenated anthraquinone derivatives, when in neat solid form, do not in general<br>
observably react with oxygen. The present applicant has surprisingly found that polymeric<br>
films formed by melt compression of hydrogenated anthraquinone derivatives with a range of<br>
different commercially available polymers, including ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymers<br>
(EVOH) and polymers comprising metaxylcnc diamine and adipic acid (eg MXD-6 nylon),<br>
absorb oxygen. The films do not require activation subsequent to processing in order to<br>
scavenge oxygen.<br>
As can be seen from the Examples, the absorption spectra of the polymeric films comprising<br>
THAQ indicates that a different chemical derivative is present in the film. The present<br>
applicant believes that this chemical derivative is the enol/enolate tautomer of THAQ.<br>
Without being bound by theory, it is believed that the presence of a base, present in residual<br>
amounts in some commercially available polymers, can catalyse the formation of the<br>
enol/enolate tautomer of the hydrogenated anthraquinone derivative and it is this species that<br>
absorbs (ic scavenges) the oxygen. Acid is also known to catalyse the tautomerisation of<br>
hydrogenated anthraquinones to the enol/enolate forms. It is also possible that the efficiency<br>
of the formation of the enol/enolate tautomer is related to the polarity of the polymer and/or<br>
the temperature involved in forming the polymeric composition.<br>
Accordingly, in a first aspect, the present invention provides a polymeric composition<br>
comprising a hydrogenated anthraquinone derivative and/or its enol/enolate tautomer or a<br>
substituted derivative thereof.<br>
The hydrogenated anthraquinone derivative and/or its enol/enolate tautomer is preferably<br>
selected from a compound of one of the formulae I, II and III:<br><br><br>
wherein each R is independently selected from hydrogen, a positively charged ion, an ester<br>
linkage and an either linkage and wherein the bonds in rings A and C of the hydrogenated<br>
anthraquinone derivative and/or its enol/enolate tautomer can be independently saturated or<br>
unsaturated and the hydrogenated anthraquinone derivative and/or its enol/enolate tautomer is<br>
optionally substituted.<br>
More preferably, the hydrogenated anthraquinone derivative and/or its enol/enolate tautomer<br>
is preferably selected from a compound of one of the formulae IV, V and VI:<br><br>
wherein each R is independently selected from hydrogen, a positively charged ion, an ester<br>
linkage and an ether linkage and wherein the bonds in ring C of the hydrogenated<br>
anthraquinone derivative and/or its enol/enolate tautomer can be independently saturated or<br>
unsaturated and the hydrogenated anthraquinone derivative and/or its enol/enolate tautomer is<br>
optionally substituted.<br>
Preferably, the positively charged ion is Na1.<br>
More preferably, the hydrogenated anthraquinone derivative comprises one or more<br>
compounds represented by the following formulae and substituted derivatives thereof:<br><br><br>
Particularly preferred hydrogenated anthraquinone derivatives are 1,4,4a,9a-<br>
Tetrahydroanihraquinonc (THAQ) and substituted derivatives thereof. Preferred substituents<br>
arc alkyl (particularly C1-6 alkyl), halo, carboxylic acid, ester, anhydride, epoxy, hydroxy, and<br>
amine groups. An example of a substituted derivative is 2-methyl-1,4,4a,9a-<br>
Tctrahydroanthraquinone (2-Me-THAQ).<br>
The present applicant expects, in the light of their discovery, that the direct incorporation into<br>
a polymeric composition of the enol/enolate form of a hydrogenated anthraquinonc derivative<br>
would also result in a polymeric composition capable of scavenging oxygen.<br>
Accordingly, in a preferred embodiment, the hydrogenated anthraquinone derivative and/or its<br>
enol/enolate derivative is an enol/enolate tautomer of a hydrogenated anthraquinone<br>
derivative or a substituted derivative thereof.<br>
Preferably, the enol/enolate tautomer of a hydrogenated anthraquinone derivative is selected<br>
from a compound of one of the formulas VII and VIII and substituted derivatives thereof:<br><br>
wherein each R is independently selected from hydrogen, a positively charged ion, an ester<br>
linkage and an either linkage. More preferably, both of the R groups are hydrogen or ester<br>
linkages.<br><br>
A preferred positively charged ion is Na+.<br>
Preferably, the compound is of formula VII. More preferably, the enol/enolate tautomer of a<br>
hydrogenated antriraquinone deri vative is the di sodium salt of formula VII.<br>
Preferably, the polymeric composition of the first aspect further comprises an acid or base.<br>
The amount of acid or base that may be present is preferably in the range of from 0.05% to<br>
1.0% and more preferably in the range of 0.05% to 0.1 % by weight of the polymeric<br>
composition.<br>
The person skilled in the art would be aware of a number of acids that would be suitable to be<br>
incorporated in any particular polymer composition according to the present invention.<br>
Suitable acids include organic and inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, benzoic acid, p-<br>
toluencsulphonic acid, and acidic salts such as sodium chloride, potassium sulphate and<br>
ammonium chloride.<br>
The person skilled in the art would be aware of a number of bases that would be suitable to be<br>
incorporated in any particular polymer composition of the present invention. Suitable bases<br>
include inorganic bases such as sodium hydroxide and basic salts such as, metal salts of<br>
carboxylates, carbonates and bicarbonates.<br>
Polymeric compositions of the first aspect may be in a solid, semi-solid (eg a gel) or liquid<br>
(eg a polymeric liquid such as an ink) form. They may therefore be applied as, or<br>
incorporated in, for example, bottle closure liners, inks, coatings, adhesives (eg<br>
polyurethanes), films, sheets, or layers in containers such as trays, bottles or blister packaging<br>
either alone or as laminations or co-extrusions. When used in films or layers, they may be<br>
blended with typical polymers or copolymers used for construction of films or layers such as<br>
those approved for food or pharmaceutical contact. Such films or layers may be produced by extrusion at temperatures between 50 "C and 350 °C depending upon chemical composition and molecular weight distribution.<br>
The hydrogenated anthraquinone derivative may be blended into the polymeric composition.<br>
The polymeric composition may be formed from any suitable polymer or blend of polymers<br><br>
including polyamides,.polyesters, polyethylene and polyvinyl alcohols. Preferably, the<br>
polymer is EVOH, a polymer comprising metaxylene diamine and adipic acid units (eg<br>
MXD-6), or a polymer comprising terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol units (eg PET).<br>
Alternatively, or additionally, the hydrogenated anthraquinone derivative itself may be in a<br>
polymerised form either as homopolymcrs or copolymers. Oligomer forms may also be<br>
suitable. Hydrogenated anthraquinone derivative-based monomers can be made, for example,<br>
by covalently bonding an ethylenically unsaturated group to ring A or C of the hydrogenated<br>
anthraquinone derivative. The hydrogenated anthraquinone derivative may also comprise<br>
groups, such as carboxylic acid, ester, anhydride, epoxy, hydroxy, and amine groups, capable<br>
of reaction with other polymerisable molecules and preformed polymers including reactions,<br>
involving the hydroxy groups of the enol tautomer. For instance, it is contemplated by the<br>
present applicant that an enol/enolate tautomer of formula VII3 can effectively act as a<br>
monomer in a copolymer by bridging through the two alcohol substituents via formation of<br>
ester or ether linkages.<br>
The polymeric compositions of the first aspect arc able to scavenge oxygen independently of<br>
the presence of a transition metal catalyst. Accordingly, in a preferred embodiment, the<br>
polymeric compositions do not comprise a transition metal catalyst.<br>
Preferably, the hydrogenated anthraquinone derivatives and/or their enol/enolate tautomer for<br>
use in the method of the present invention are substantially colourless or show reduced colour<br>
relative to anthraquinones (particularly 2-ethylanthraquinone). Preferably, the hydrogenated<br>
anthraquinone derivative and/or its enol/enolate tautomer is selected such that it has a<br>
maximum absorbance in the visible spectrum (400nm - 700nm) that is no more than half that<br>
of the reduced form of 2-ethylanthraquinone in EVOH under the same conditions.<br>
In a second aspect, the present invention provides a method of scavenging oxygen<br>
(particularly ground state molecular oxygen) in an atmosphere or liquid comprising the steps<br>
of:<br>
(i) providing a polymeric composition according to the first aspect; and<br><br>
(ii) exposing the atmosphere or liquid to the composition;<br>
such that at least a portion of the oxygen in the atmosphere or liquid is removed through<br>
oxidation of the hydrogenated anthraquinone derivative and/or its enol/enolate tautomcr.<br>
The person skilled in the art would be aware that polymeric compositions of the first aspect<br>
may also be used as a chemical barrier to oxygen transmission through a packaging material.<br>
Thus, if a packaging material has Finite oxygen permeability, the oxygen passing through it<br>
from the outside environment can be scavenged by the hydrogenated anthraquinone or<br>
cnol/enolate tautomer thereof.<br>
Accordingly, in a third aspect, the present invention provides a method of preventing the<br>
transmission of oxygen (particularly ground state molecular oxygen) through a package, said<br>
method comprising forming a package comprising or consisting of a packaging material, said<br>
packaging material comprising a polymerie composition according to the first aspect.<br>
In order that the nature of the present invention may be more clearly understood, preferred<br>
forms thereof will now be described with reference to the following non-limiting examples.<br><br><br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1: Oxygen scavenging by a composition comprising THAQ in EVOH<br>
A composition was prepared by blending l,4,4a,9a-Tetrahydroanthraquinone (THAQ) at a<br>
level of approximately 2%w/w into commercially available EVOH (32 mole% ethylene<br>
content) at 190 "C. The composition was then compression moulded to form a film having a<br>
thickness of about 30 µm. The film was then quickly transferred into a foil multilayer bag,<br>
and this bag was then vacuum-sealed to form a flat package containing essentially no<br>
hcadspacc. This foil-lined pouch allows essentially no ingress of oxygen from the atmosphere<br>
into the inside of the pouch. Air was then injected into the foil-lined pouch and the pouch<br>
stored at constant temperature. The oxygen content inside the pouch was determined using<br>
gas chromatography. The change in oxygen concentration in three pouches prepared in the<br>
manner described above, and stored at 40 °C, is shown in Table 1. The films were<br>
substantially colourless and remained that way after exposure to oxygen.<br><br><br>
Example 2: Oxygen scavenging by a composition comprising 2-Me-THAQ in EVOH<br>
The composition was prepared by blending 2-TncthyI-l,4,4a,9a-Tetrahydroanthraquinone (2-<br>
Me-THAQ) at a level of approximately 2%w/w into EVOH (44 molc% ethylene content) at<br>
190 oC. The composition was then compression moulded at 190 °C to form films having a<br>
thickness of about 50 µm. Each film was then quickly transferred into a foil multilayer bag,<br>
and the hags were then vacuum-sealed to form flat packages containing essentially no<br>
headspace. This Foil-lined pouch allows essentially no ingress of oxygen from the atmosphere<br>
into the inside of the pouch. A 4% O2/96% N2 gas mixture was then injected into each pouch.<br>
The pouches were then placed in a 120 *C oven to simulate the temperature of retort<br>
processing. The oxygen concentration of the headspace was determined using Gas<br>
Chromatography. The change in oxygen concentration in the pouches prepared in the manner<br>
described above is shown in Table 2. The films were substantially colourless and remained<br>
that way after exposure to oxygen.<br><br><br>
Example 3: Enhanced barrier to oxygen permeation by a composition comprising 2-Me-<br>
THAQ in EVOH<br>
EVOH films (44 mole% ethylene content) containing approximately 2%w/w 2-Me-TILAQ<br>
were prepared by melt-mixing and then melt-compression at 190 oC. Film thicknesses were<br>
in the range 40-60 µm, and care was required to prepare films free from entrapped air bubbles<br>
which would otherwise interfere with the measurements. The oxygen transmission<br>
measurements were conducted using a technique involving sandwiching an oxygen-sensitive<br>
indicator film containing rubrene between two EVOH-based test films and sealing the three<br>
layers in a test cell. The test cell is then placed in an illuminated controlled<br>
temperature/humidity cabinet. The tests in this work were performed in air at 23 °C and 57%<br>
RH. The colour of the oxygen-sensitive indicator film decreases in the presence of oxygen<br>
and light, and this change is used to determine the permeation Tate of oxygen through the test<br>
films. The light in the storage cabinet was filtered such that only the rubrene in the oxygen-<br>
sensitive indicator film received light during the course of experiments. The results of the<br>
experiments are shown in Figure 1 and they clearly indicate that the incorporation of 2-Mc-<br>
THAQ into the EVOH film substantially reduces the amount of oxygen transmitted through<br>
the film. The films were substantially colourless and remained that way after exposure to<br>
oxygen.<br>
Example 4: Enhanced barrier to oxygen permeation by a composition comprising<br>
THAQ in MXD6<br>
The amorphous MXD6 films containing approximately 2%w/w THAQ were prepared by<br>
melt-mixing and then melt-compression at 250 oC. Film thicknesses were in the range 50-70<br>
µm, and care was required to prepare films free from entrapped air bubbles which would<br>
otherwise interfere with the measurements. The oxygen transmission measurements were conducted using a technique involving sandwiching an oxygen-sensitive indicator film<br>
containing rubrene between two MXD6-based test films and sealing the three layers in a test<br>
cell. The test cell is then placed in an illuminated controlled temperature/humidity cabinet.<br>
The tests in this work were performed in air at 23 °C and 57% RH. The colour of the oxygen-<br>
sensitive indicator film decreases in the presence of oxygen and light, and this change is used<br><br>
to determine the permeation of oxygen through the test films. The light in the storage cabinet<br>
was filtered such that only the rubrene in the oxygen-sensitive indicator film received light<br>
during the course of experiments. Figure 2 indicates that oxygen transmission through the<br>
MXD6 film is reduced substantially when the film comprises THAQ, The films were<br>
substantially colourless and remained that way after exposure to oxygen.<br>
Example 5: Enolisation of THAQ in solution<br>
The absorption spectrum of a solution of THAQ dissolved in isopropanol (libelled "a") and a<br>
solution of THAQ dissolved in DMSO (labelled "b") is shown in Figure 3. The difference<br>
between the absorption spectrum for THAQ in isopropanol and THAQ in DMSO indicates<br>
the formation of a different chemical species in DMSO, and the identity of this species was<br>
determined by 1H nmr analysis to be the enol form of THAQ. Enolisation of THAQ was<br>
found not to occur in isopropanol solution at room temperature.<br>
Example 6: Enolisation of THAQ in MXD6<br>
The composition was prepared by blending approximately 2%w/w of THAQ into<br>
commercially available MXD6, followed by compression moulding at 250 °C to form a film<br>
having a thickness of about 50 urn. The absorption spectrum of this film is shown in Figure<br>
4. The difference between the absorption spectrum of THAQ in isopropanol (see Figure 3,<br>
spectrum "a") and THAQ in MXD6 indicates the formation of a different chemical species in<br>
the MXD6, and this new species is assigned to the enol form of THAQ due to the very close<br>
similarity to the absorption spectrum of the enol tautomcr in DMSO shown in Figure 3,<br>
spectrum "b".<br>
Example 7: Enolisation of 2-Me-THAQ in EVOH<br>
A composition was prepared by blending 2-Me-THAQ at a level of approximately l%w/w<br>
into commercially available EVOH (44 mole% ethylene content) at 190 oC. The composition<br>
was then compression moulded to form a film having a thickness of about 75 µm. The<br>
absorption spectrum of this film is shown in Figure 5. The difference between the absorption<br>
spectrum of THAQ in isopropanol (sec Figure 3T spectrum "a") and 2-Me-THAQ in EVOH<br><br>
indicates the formation of a different chemical species in the EVOH, and this new species is<br>
assigned to the cnol form of 2-McTHAQ due to the very close similarity to the absorption<br>
spectrum of the enol tautomer of THAQ in DMSO shown in Figure 3, spectrum "b".<br>
Example 8: Enolisation of hydrogenated anthraquinone derivatives in PETG<br>
Compositions were prepared by blending THAQ, 2-Me-THAQ and 2-Me-1 ,2,3,,4,4a,9a-<br>
Hexahydroanthraquinone (2-Me-HHAQ) at a level of approximately l%w/w into<br>
commercially available PETG at 190 °C. The compositions were then compression moulded<br>
to form films having a thickness of about 110 µm. The absorption spectra of these films are<br>
shown in Figure 6. The difference between the absorption spectrum of THAQ in isopropanol<br>
(see Figure 3, spectrum "a") and these hydrogenated anthraquinone derivatives in PETG<br>
indicates the formation of a different chemical species in the PETG, and this new species is<br>
assigned to the enol forms of the hydrogenated anthraquinone derivatives due to the close<br>
similarity to the absorption spectrum or the enol tautomer of THAQ in DMSO shown in<br>
Figure 3, spectrum "b".<br>
