PRIOR ART and DRAW BACKS<br>
Although, there are some cases where pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic<br>
features of drug therapy demand frequent administration of doses. The repeated<br>
administration either orally or parenterally may result in fluctuating medication levels in<br>
blood as well as significant physical and monetary burden on the patients. Rational drug<br>
therapy requires sustained blood levels of drugs/ therapeutic agents to achieve the most<br>
effective therapeutic results. Moreover, many conditions respond better to controlled<br>
levels of therapeutic agent. Thus, a need exists for controlled release medicament to<br>
provide prolonged drug concentration in blood.. Such controlled release medication<br>
would provide the patients with not only enhanced prophylactic, therapeutic or diagnostic<br>
effects and reduced adverse effects but also a decrease in the frequency of administration<br>
as well as overall cost.<br>
Oral solid dosage forms can be prepared in the form of single-unit and multi-unit<br>
microparticulate dosage forms. The advantages of the microparticulates (like<br>
microcapsules, microbeads, etc.) over single-unit (tablets and capsules, etc.,) have been<br>
recognized (Davis, et al., (1984), Int.J.Pharm, 21,167-177; Follonier et al., (1992), STP<br>
Pharma Science, 2,141-158). In this context, many methods to formulate<br>
microparticulates have been developed. Of these, both oil in oil and oil in water solvent<br>
evaporation methods (both oil/oil and oil/water) were widely studied (Sa, (1991), Drug<br>
Dev.Ind.Pharm, 27, 893-900; Barkai et al.,(1990), Drug Dev.Ind.Pharm, 16, 2057-2075).<br>
However, these methods are debated for the use of organic solvents because of toxicity<br>
factors, and during the course of solvent evaporation, apart from the partitioning of<br>
organic solvent of the dispersed phase, the active principle may also partition to some<br>
extent at the interface. Moreover, quantities of organic solvents employed at industrial<br>
scales are very expensive (prices being quoted for high-purity solvents, recovery costs,<br>
and solvent destructions), and trace residues of organic solvents are often difficult to<br>
eliminate from the dosage forms. International health authorities and scientific bodies<br>
have recently focused their attention towards the investigation of toxic residual solvents<br><br>
in active ingredients and pharmaceutical formulations, and they have imposed maximum<br>
limits on particular solvent (Gachon, (1991), STP-Pharma Pratiques. 1, 531-536). As<br>
result of these new directives, microparticle manufacturers are trying to concentrate their<br>
efforts on organic solvent-free technologies. The only way to overcome such<br>
technological and regulatory restrictions is the use of hydrophilic polymers and mild<br>
aqueous processing conditions.<br>
One such promising method is ionotropic gelation method. The concept of ionotropic<br>
gelation is the interaction between a polyelectrolyte and either oppositely charged<br>
polyelectrolyte or polyvalent ion and both leads to the formation of gel networks. Using<br>
this concept, many polyanionic polyelectrolytes (sodium alginate, pectinate, carrageenan,<br>
kojakmanan, carboxymethyl cellulose) have been cross-linked with polycations and<br>
converted to microparticles. These systems are used both in biomedical and<br>
pharmaceutical applications because of aqueous, ecofriendly and simple preparative<br>
Conditions and economical reasons (Kierstan and Coughlan, (1985)Kierstan, M.P.J. &amp; Coughlan, MP. (1985).<br>
Immobilization ofcells and enzymes by gel entrapment. In: Woodward. J (Ed.)., Immobilized cells and enzymes: Apractical approach.<br>
Oxford: IRL Press, pp. 39-47).<br>
In the above context, Indian patent application no. 578/KOL/2004 discloses that by<br>
ionotropic gelation technique, sodium salt of carboxymethyl xanthan (NaCMX) gum can<br>
be cross-linked by polyvalent metal ions to form gel-microbead system, and also<br>
discloses that these gel-microbeads can be used as carrier as well as drug delivery<br>
devices. However, from the industrial point of view and protecting the encapsulated<br>
therapeutic agents from harsh process conditions, process and formulation conditions<br>
were not optimized. Also, the polyelectrolyte complexation between NaCMX gum (a<br>
polyanion) and a polycation such as chitosan that increases the strength of the gel-<br>
microbeads was not explored.<br>
It is well established that, in addition to the ability to form cation-induced gels,<br>
anionic polysaccharides can cross-link with high molecular weight polycations to form<br>
water-insoluble polyelectrolyte complexes (PECs).The application of PEC membrane in<br>
the preparation of durable and semi-permeable membrane capsules for the<br>
immobilization of living cells, enzymes and controlled release of drugs have been<br>
described in several studies.<br><br>
Many microspheres/microcapsules based on the alginate and chitosan polyelectrolyte<br>
complexes have been widely investigated with respect to drug delivery applications. For<br>
example: Huguet et al., (1994). J. Appl. Polym. Sci. 51: 1427-1432.; Polk et al., J.<br>
Pharm. Sci. 83: 178-185.1994; Ribeiro et al., Int.J.Pharm.187: 115-123.1999; Sezer et al.,<br>

et al., Artif. Cells Blood Subst. Biotech. 28:95-111. 2000; Vandenberg et al., J. Control.<br>

al., J. Microencapsul. 232: 225-234.2002; Gonzalez-Rodriguez et al., Int. J.Pharm.232:<br>
225-234.2002).<br>
In view of the above, the present invention seeks to provide drug-loaded gel-<br>
microbead system based on sodium carboxymethyl xanthan gum and a method for<br>
preparing polyelectrolyte complex (CMXG gum-chitosan i.e. CMXG/CS) gel-<br>
microcapsules of higher strength for controlled drug delivery.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
The present invention grew out of the studies using sodium carboxymethyl xanthan<br>
(NaCMX) gum (a modified xanthan gum), a polyanionic polysaccharide, for the<br>
preparation of gel-microbeads (see co-pending Indian patent application no.<br>
578/KOL/2004) by ionotropic cross-linking with polyvalent cations. These beads were<br>
claimed as carrier systems for bioactive agents. However, the utility of these gel-<br>
microbeads in the drug delivery was not explored.<br>
The present invention thus relates to a novel polymeric gel-microbead/microcapsule<br>
system based on the NaCMX gum and is concerned -<br>
a)	with the formulation of drug-loaded microbeads from NaCMX gum by ionotropic<br>
gelation with polyvalent cation solution,<br>
b)	with the effect of variables on the release profiles of the drug from the beads,<br>
c)	with interionic-polyelectrolyte complexation between two oppositely charged<br>
polyelectrolytes; NaCMX gum (a polyanion) and chitosan (a polycation), and<br><br>
d) with the effect of variables on the release from carboxymethyl xanthan<br>
gum/chitosan(CMXG/CS) gel-microcapsules.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Recently, the preparations of microspheres and microcapsules using water based<br>
techniques have been encouraged because of regulatory restrictions to limit the use of<br>
organic solvents and also cost considerations. In preferred embodiment of the invention,<br>
polyanionic polysaccharide is sodium carboxymethyl xanthan (NaCMX) gum, which can<br>
be cross-linked and / or gelled by means of polyvalent cation. The knowledge of its<br>
polyanionic nature, cross-linking with polyvalent cations, and as carrier device for active<br>
agents has been drawn from the previous invention (Indian patent application no.<br>
578/KOL/2004).<br>
Also in the preferred embodiment of the invention, polyvalent cation in step (a) is<br>
selected from trivalent metal ions such as aluminium(III), ferric(IIII), etc, and is most<br>
preferably aluminium(III) and is obtained from aluminium chloride solutions. Although<br>
ferric (III) ions can form beads it gives unpleasant dark coloured beads and may lead to<br>
unstable formulations because of its redox characteristics.<br>
The successes or acceptance of any new technique for the formulation of delivery<br>
device is based on the optimization of the both process and formulation variables which<br>
not only protect the encapsulated active therapeutic agents but also provide a cost<br>
effective production technology.<br>
In the previous application 578/KOL/2004, we have reported a gel-microbead system<br>
as bioactive carrier. However, to protect the active agents such as cells, enzymes,<br>
proteins, vaccines, drugs, etc., from harsher process conditions and keep their viability<br>
longer or reduce the time and production cost with drug based formulations, it requires a<br>
thorough optimization of the process variables. The furosemide was used in this<br>
invention as a model active agent and various variables were optimized.<br>
In the previous application 578/KOL/2004, we have reported on the production of<br>
gel-microbead system based on the ionotropic gelation method. However, in that<br><br>
invention, various preparative variables (such as concentration of cross-linking<br>
agent/counter ion, time of cross-linking/incubation, and drug loading) which would be<br>
used in the manufacture of the gel-microbeads were not optimized.<br>
It is well known that, gel formation depends on the concentration of cross-linking<br>
agent that induces gelation. The use of unlimited amount of cross-linking agents may lead<br>
to the exposure of the active agents to the harsh effects and also increase the cost of<br>
manufacturing. Therefore, in this invention, concentration of AICI3 was varied from a<br>
lower level (1%) to a higher level (5%), but gelation is not limited in this range (1-<br>
5%w/v) and may occur at any level. The effect of concentration of Al ions on the<br>
gelation was studied using gelation, swelling behavior, differential scanning calorimetric<br>
(DSC) and in vitro drug release studies.<br>
The increase in the time of incubation (cross-linking) should generally increase the<br>
degree of cross-linking; however, there exists a time where entire matrix will be cross-<br>
linked as soon as the number of active groups (Na) in the matrix of NaCMX gum are no<br>
more available for exchange with A1JT ions of the cross-linking agent. It can be said that<br>
preparation of gel-microbeads by exposing to an optimum period not only saves the time<br>
but also reduces the leaching of active agent to the cross-linking agent (provided the<br>
active agent is soluble in the solutions of cross-linking agent, i.e. AlCl3).The cross-<br>
linking (or incubation) time was optimized between 0.5hr to 24hr. However, gelation is<br>
not limited to this level studied, since the gelation is an instantaneous reaction and forms<br>
the gel-front as soon as the solution of the NaCMX gum contacts the AICI3 solution and<br>
cross-linking goes on for about five days.<br>
An optimum amount of drug must be released to reach the drug plasma concentration<br>
in the therapeutic level. Since the release rate of drug from the formulation will influence<br>
the therapeutic effect of drug, various release rates can be obtained by varying the<br>
formulation variables. The nature of the drug release profiles may also depend on the<br>
concentration of drug present inside the matrix. The presence of drug may affect the<br>
strength of the gel matrix and influence the drug release profile. So by varying the<br>
concentration of the drug in the matrix, desired release rate/profile can be obtained. In<br><br>
this embodiment, the concentration of the drug was varied between 30 to 70% w/w of the<br>
polymer.<br>
In the second embodiment of this invention, in an attempt to control/retard the release<br>
of drug from beads, the strength of the beads was increased by preparing polyelectrolyte<br>
complex (PEC) beads. To achieve this, the polyanionic nature of the NaCMX gum has<br>
been exploited. It is well known that, in addition to the ability to form cation-induced<br>
gels, anionic polysaccharides can also cross-link with high molecular weight polycations<br>
to form water-insoluble polyelectrolyte complexes (PECs) (Fukuda, Bull. Chem. Soc.<br>
Jpn. 53, 1980, 837; Takahashi et al., Int J Pharm. 61, 1990, 35-41).<br>
Of all the polycations, chitosan, a deacetylated chitin, received more attention as it is<br>
obtained from natural sources, biodegradable, least toxic with good medicinal<br>
functionality, and has been used in wound dressings (Denuziere, et al 1998), and<br>
controlled-release drug delivery systems (Ilium, L et al 1994).<br><br>
EXPERIMANTAL<br>
1.	Preparation of furosemide-loaded beads<br>
The drug-loaded gel-microbeads were prepared following the method described<br>
elsewhere (Indian patent application no. 578/KOL/2004). In 30ml aqueous solution of<br>
NaCMX gum, required amount of furosemide was dispersed and homogenized for 15<br>
min. Bubble free dispersion was dropped through a 16 bore glass syringe in gently<br>
agitated AlCl3 solution. After incubating for predetermined times the gelled beads were<br>
separated by filtration, washed with 3 x 100 ml de-ionized water, air dried overnight and<br>
finally dried at 60°C for 4 h. The following experimental parameters were varied :<br>
(i) Gelation time : 0.5. 1,4, 8 and 24 h,<br>
(ii) Concentration of AlCl3 solution : 1, 3 and 5% w/v, and<br>
(iii) Amount of furosemide : 30, 50 and 70% w/w of the polymer.<br>
2.	In vitro release study<br>
In vitro release of furosemide from beads were monitored using about 20 mg beads,<br>
accurately weighed, in 900mL of simulated intestinal fluid (SIF) (USP phosphate buffer<br>
solution, pH 6.8) at 37±0.5 °C and 50 rpm using programmable dissolution tester (Paddle<br>
type, Electrolab, model TDT-06P (USP), India). Aliquots were withdrawn at<br>
predetermined intervals and were replenished immediately with the same volume of fresh<br>
buffer solution. Aliquots, following suitable dilutions, were assayed<br>
spectrophotometrically at 277 nm,<br><br>
3.	Preparation of microcapsules from NaCMX gum<br>
The gel-microbeads were prepared following the method described elsewhere (Indian<br>
patent application no. 578/KOL/2004). In brief, solution (2.25%w/v) of NaCMX gum in<br>
deionized water was extruded through 16 bore glass syringe into gently agitated 100ml<br>
of l%w/v AlCl3 solutions. The gel beads were harvested after 30min, washed with<br>
deionized water (3x100ml) and dried at room temperature overnight followed by drying<br>
in vacuum oven at 60° C.<br>
In another set of formulations, solutions of the NaCMX gum were extruded into<br>
100ml of l%w/v AlCl3 solutions each containing chitosan (0.1 or 0.3%w/v in 1% w/v<br>
glacial acetic acid) solutions. The gel capsules were then harvested after 15 or 30 min,<br>
and washed with deionized water (3x100 ml) and dried in room temperature for 12 h<br>
followed by vacuum oven at 60°C.<br>
4.	FTIR<br>
IR spectra for finely powdered A1CMX beads and, A1CMX/CS beads were recorded<br>
in a Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrophotometer (FT-IR,410 JASCO, Japan)<br>
with KBr pellets.<br>
5.	Swelling studies<br>
Swelling ratios of the dried microbeads of A1CMX and A1CMX/CS microcapsules<br>
without drug were determined gravimetrically in slightly agitated USP phosphate buffer<br>
solutions pH 6.8. The beads were removed periodically from the buffer solution, blotted<br>
to remove excess surface liquid and weighed on electronic balance. Swelling ratio<br>
(%w/w) was determined from the following relationship and plotted against time.<br>
Swelling ratio = (WrWo)/Wox 100<br>
where, Wo and Wt are respectively initial weight of the beads and weight of the beads at<br>
time 't'<br><br>
6.	Preparation of furosemide loaded microcapsules'.<br>
In 30ml aqueous solution of NaCMX gum, required amount of furosemide(30%w/w)<br>
was dispersed and homogenized for 30min. Bubble free dispersion was extruded through<br>
a 16 bore glass syringe into a gently agitated 1%AlCl3 solution. After incubating for 30<br>
min, the gelled beads were separated by filtration, washed with 3 xl00 ml de-ionized<br>
water, dried at room temperature overnight and finally dried at 60 °C for 4 h.<br>
In another set of formulations, the microcapsules were prepared by extruding into<br>
gently agitated 100 ml of chitosan solutions (0.1 or 0.3% w/v) containing glacial acetic<br>
acid (0.5% w/v) and incubated for 10 or 30 min. Beads were washed with deionized<br>
water, dried in air followed by drying in vacuum oven drying for 4h at 60°C.<br>
7.	SEM<br>
Dried A1CMX beads and, A1CMX/CS (coated with chitosan at different variables)<br>
were mounted onto stubs, using double sided adhesive tape and vacuum coated with gold<br>
film using sputter coater (Edward S-150, UK). Coated particles were observed under<br>
scanning electron microscope (Jeol, ISM-5200, Japan) for surface characteristics.<br>
BRIEF EXPAINATION OF DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1: The effect of incubation time in A1C13 (l%w/v) solution on furosemide<br>
release profiles<br>
As accompanying in Figure 1, at lower incubation times (0.5 and 1h), the release<br>
of furosemide from the beads was faster compared to that at higher incubation<br>
times (4,8, and 24 h).<br>
Figure 2: The effect of concentration of AlCl3 solution on furosemide release<br>
profiles<br><br>
As accompanying in Figure 2, increasing concentrations of cross-linking agent (1-<br>
5%w/v AlCl3) has decreased the both t50% and t8o% (time to release 50% and 80%<br>
of the release) values.<br>
Figure 3: The effect of initial drug loading on furosemide release profiles<br>
As accompanying in Figure 3, increase in the amount of furosemide increases the<br>
release of furosemide.<br>
Figure. 4: FT-IR spectroscopy<br>
IR spectra of CMXG beads, chitosan and CMXG/CS beads as accompanying in<br>
figure 4 (a), 4(b) and 4(c) respectively. In comparision with CMXG(3434.7 cm-1) and<br>
chitosan(3368 cm-1), the -OH stretching vibration bands of the microspheres were<br>
broadened and shifted to a lower wave number(3423cm-1), also -COO -gropus( 1623.3cm"<br>
1) for CMXG beads shifted to 1634.3cm-1, suggesting the ionic interaction between -<br>
COO- groups of CMX and -NH3+ groups of chitosan. In CMXG/CS beads(figure 4c),<br>
appearance of a new peak at 1479.1cm-1 for primary amides will further confirm the<br>
formation PEC membrane by the interaction between -COO- groups of CMXG beads and<br>
-NH3+ of the chitosan.<br>
Figure. 5: Scanning electron microscopy<br>
As accompanying in Figure.5, surface characteristics of the drug loaded CMXG<br>
beads and CMXG/CS microcapsules. The CMXG beads (Figure5a) found to be<br>
smoother compared to CMXG/CS microcapsules. In addition, the surface of the CS<br>
treated microcapsules appears to have bigger depressions at lower chitosan treatment<br>
intervals (Figure.5c and 5e, at 15 min exposure in CS solutions). The reason may<br>
attributed to the collapse of the gel structure due to the formation of PEC membrane that<br>
recovered shape with increasing incubation times(Figure 5d and 5f, at 30 min exposure in<br>
CS solutions) as the Al3+ entered the beads and formed three-dimensional network<br>
through ionic cross-linking. Figure 5(b) shows cross section of the drug free-CMXG/CS.<br>
The formation of thin PEC membrane is clear from these beads.<br><br>
Figure. 6: Swelling studies<br>
As accompanying in Figure 6, the swelling behavior of the CMXG beads and<br>
CMX/CS microcapsules in phosphate buffer solutions (pH6.8), swelling of the CMXG<br>
beads were more due to the ionization of the gel by basic ions(-OH, HPO42-.) of the<br>
buffer. The increase in the electrostatic repulsion between the ionized -COO- groups of<br>
the gel disrupts the cross-links and increases the mesh size encompassing a huge amount<br>
of solvent. While in case of CMXG /CS beads lower swelling can be attributed to<br>
mechanisms involved; the protonation of-COO- groups of CMXG and the potonation of<br>
-NH2 groups of the CS which enhanced the electrostatic interaction between the acidic<br>
form of-COOH groups and protonated form of-NH2 groups of CS Finally, it can be said<br>
that, the swelling of the CMXG /CS beads was markedly reduced due to the formation of<br>
a PEC membrane and membrane would remain more tightly packed and create a stronger<br>
barrier to the solvent molecules. Thus the ionization of the surface of the beads was<br>
restricted. Finally it can be concluded that chitosan formed a PEC membrane with<br>
CMXG.<br>
Figure 7: Drying studies<br>
As accompanying in Figure 7, A1CMX beads (•) have dried faster than the any<br>
chitosan coated beads. This indicates that chitosan has formed a PEC membrane. The<br>
formation of PEC was responsible for the slower drying of the A1CMX/CS<br>
microcapsules.<br>
Figure 8: Drug release studies<br>
As accompanying in Figure 8, A1CMX beads released the drug faster compared to<br>
any of the chitosan coated (CMX/CS) beads. The formation PEC on the A1CMX beads<br>
may be attributed to the slower drug release. The formation of PEC on the A1CMX beads<br>
is thus said to have produced the high strength gel-microbeads<br><br>
