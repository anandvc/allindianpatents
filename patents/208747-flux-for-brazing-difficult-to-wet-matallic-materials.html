Flux for brazing difficult to wet metallic materials<br>
Description:<br>
The invention relates to a flux for brazing difficult to wet metallic materials with silver- and copper-based solders. Materials of this kind which are difficult to wet by the solder in the brazing process are substantially stainless and scale-free steels and composite materials produced by powder metallurgy, such as carbide metals.<br>
Soldering is a thermal process for joining and coating materials by fusion, wherein a liquid phase is obtained by melting a metallic material, namely the solder. The solidus temperature of the parent materials is not reached during this process.<br>
Solders used are alloys or pure metals. If solders are processed whose liquidus temperature is above 450°C, the term brazing is used.<br>
Assuming pure metal surfaces, the liquid solder is able to wet the parent material in so far as it forms mixed crystals or intermetallic compounds with said material. The solder then spreads out over the joint surface and, after solidifying, forms a loadable joint with the parent material.<br>
If designed in a manner suitable for soldering, the two joint surfaces of the parts to be joined form a narrow parallel slit. The molten solder then flows of its own accord into the soldering slit due to the capillary filling pressure taking effect, and fills said slit. The minimum temperature on the surface of the component to be soldered at which said process takes place undisturbed is the so-called working temperature. It is a characteristic quantity for the solder in question.<br><br>
2<br>
In order to be able to form a bond with the parent material, the molten solder must come into direct contact with the metallic parent material. Oxide layers of the kind present on any engineering metal surface must thus be loosened first and removed. If soldering takes place in the air, this is achieved by covering the soldering site with fluxes in the melt flow of which the oxides dissolve or are decomposed at soldering temperature.<br>
The flux thus primarily has the task of removing oxides present on the solder and material surfaces and preventing them from re-forming during the soldering process so that the solder is able to wet the parent material sufficiently.<br>
The melting point and the effective temperature of the fluxes must be matched to the working temperature of the solder used, whereby the flux should melt at about 50-100° below the working temperature of the solder used and become fully effective from this temperature onwards. Moreover, the molten flux should form a dense, uniform coating on the workpiece which remains intact at the required soldering temperature and for the duration of the soldering period.<br>
Brazing fluxes are composed substantially of salt mixtures which, in the molten state, are capable of dissolving metal oxides. Said fluxes are substantially inorganic boron compounds such as, in particular, alkali borates and fluoroborates, and halides such as, in particular, alkali fluorides.<br>
The standard DIN EN 1045 classifies fluxes for brazing heavy metals (FH type) into seven classes according to their composition and effective temperature. The fluxes are used as powders, pastes or suspensions, the latter being applied to the workpieces by spraying, brushing or dipping. They are then heated to melting point and the parent materials are joined together by fusion by adding solder. It is also known to combine flux and solder in one product.<br><br>
3<br>
Flux-coated moulded parts or flux-covered solder wires are thus also used in practice for joining parent materials.<br>
DE 24 44 521 describes a flux for soldering which is composed of boric acid and various alkali metal polyborates. Said flux may also additionally contain 1 wt.% of boron in elemental form.<br>
GB 909 314 discloses a brazing flux for brazing nickel and nickel alloys. Said flux contains, apart from the conventional constituents such as potassium tetrafluoroborate, potassium metaborate and potassium fluoride, additionally copper compounds such as copper oxide and copper chloride. The latter constituents are claimed to suppress the reaction of the flux with the parent material in order to prevent the latter becoming brittle.<br>
The well known fluxes have a major disadvantage, however. Difficult to wet parent materials such as, for example, stainless and scale-free steels and carbide metals, particularly carbide metals with low cobalt contents of less than 6% (K01-K10, PO5) are wetted only insufficiently by the liquid solder when the conventional fluxes are used. Fluxes containing an addition of elemental boron (FH12 type) are used in engineering to join said parent materials. The addition of boron is designed to increase the stability above about 700°C, that is, the time during which the flux is active. The wetting of carbide metals and chromium-nickel steels themselves is not, however, improved in practice by the addition of boron, particularly when soldering with low working temperatures {below 680°C).<br>
Special soldering tasks, such as, for example, the joining of diamond-impregnated carbide metals require further reduced soldering temperatures so that the diamond filling and the carbide metal are not damaged. Cadmium-containing silver brazing solders or preferably gallium-containing<br><br>
4<br>
silver brazing solders as described, for example, in DE 43 15 188 and DE 43 15 189, are used for said application. Said solders have a working temperature from 590°C to 640°C. Conventional fluxes have only insufficent effectiveness and wetting ability in this temperature range. This reduces the process reliablity during soldering and thus leads to increasing scrap and reduced product quality.<br>
The object of the present invention was, therefore, to develop a flux for brazing difficult to wet parent materials such as stainless and scale-free steels and carbide metals, wherein all combinations of salts provided for by the standard DIN EN 1045 for brazing heavy metals (FH type)are used as the basic constituents of said flux, and which, with silver- and copper-based solders, permits a markedly improved wetting of the parent materials.<br>
The object according to the invention is achieved by a flux based on inorganic boron and/or halogen compounds which contains, as an activating addition, based on the total amount of flux, 0.01-10 wt.% of elemental boron and 0.01-10 wt.% of at least one of the elements Mo, W, Mn, Ni, Pd, Cu or Ag in the form of elements, alloys or compounds.<br>
Surprisingly, it has become apparent that as a result of the flux according to the invention, the wetting of difficult to wet materials such as stainless and scale-free steels and more particularly also carbide metals and hard materials with low metal contents is markedly improved compared with conventional fluxes. Evidently, the content of boron and additionally of at least one of the other elements brings about a corresponding activation of fluxes with an otherwise conventional composition. It is interesting in this connection that the individual constituents of said activator -mixture on their own do not exhibit an improvement in the effectiveness of the conventional fluxes. Only the combination of boron with at<br><br>
5<br>
least one of the elements, an alloy or compound of Mo, W, Mn, Co, Ni, Pd, Cu and Ag exhibits this surprising behaviour in conjunction with brazing fluxes of boron and/or halogen compounds.<br>
The brazing flux according to the invention is based substantially on conventional basic substances known for such fluxes and the compositions thereof in terms of quantity, as specified, for example, in terms of quality and quantity by the standard DIN EN 1045.<br>
Basic constituents of such kind are inorganic boron and/or halogen compounds. Suitable boron compounds are primarily boric acid and borates or complex borates of alkali and alkaline earth metals, particularly borax (sodium tetraborate), potassium tetraborate and potassium tetrafluoroborate. Suitable halogen compounds are primarily finflririps and chlorides of alkali and alkaline earth metals, particularly potassium and sodium fluoride or potassium and sodium hydrogen fluoride.<br>
According to the invention, the brazing flux contains an activator combination of, based on the total amount, 0.01-10 wt.% of elemental boron and 0.01-10 wt.% of at least one of the elements Mo, W, Mn, Co, Ni, Pd, Cu or Ag in order to intensify the wetting. The flux preferably contains 0.1-5 wt.% of elemental boron and 0.1-5 wt.% of the other elements mentioned, in each case based on the total amount of flux.<br>
Advantageously, the elemental boron used is boron in amorphous form. The other elements may be used on their own or in combination in elemental form, in the form of alloys containing them, or in the form of compounds thereof. Suitable compounds are preferably corresponding oxides.<br>
The components of the activator combination are used advantageously in the finely powdered form, in which case<br><br>
6<br>
the average particle size thereof should preferably be less than 4 5 fim.<br>
The flux according to the invention for brazing difficult to wet materials is prepared by mixing, intensively and homogeneously, based on the total amount of flux, initially 0.01-10 wt.% of finely powdered boron powder with 0.01-10 wt.% of a finely powdered addition of at least one of the elements Mo, W, Mn, Co, Ni, Pd, Cu and Ag, which may be present in the form of elements, alloys or compounds, and then adding this activator mixture afterwards to the finely powdered flux mixture of inorganic boron and halogen compounds.<br>
Flux mixtures which, in addition to boron, contain the elements tungsten or manganese in elemental form, as an alloy, or in the form of an oxide, are particularly effective.<br>
The brazing flux according to the invention preferably contains, as activator mixture, based on the total amount of flux, 0.5-3 wt.% of boron in amorphous form and 0.5-3 wt.% of manganese with an average particle size in each case of less than 45 (?m. The manganese may be used here in powder form as a metal, as an alloy or as an oxide compound without the effectiveness being affected as a result. Advantageously, the manganese is introduced in the form of the alloy MnNi40 or as manganese dioxide.<br>
In order to adjust to certain parent materials and operating conditions, the flux may contain up to 2 wt.% of Si preferably in the form bound to oxygen, for example, as silicon dioxide. This additive, too, is added to the mixture in a correspondingly finely powdered form.<br>
The flux according to the invention is initially present as a powder mixture and may already be used as such in an inherently known way.<br><br>
7<br>
The flux may also be present in the form of pastes or suspensions, for which the powder mixture is converted to a paste and/or suspension with inert liquids such as water, aliphatic alcohols, glycols etc.<br>
Such flux pastes or suspensions may also contain minor amounts of auxiliary substances such as, e.g., conventional surfactants, binders or thickeners.<br>
For application, the brazing flux according to the invention is applied to the parent material surfaces to be joined or soldered in a manner suitable for the form in question, for example, by sprinkling, coating, brushing, spraying or dipping, and the brazing process is carried out. In so doing, the flux according to the invention brings about a substantial improvement in the wetting behaviour of the solder on the parent materials during brazing with silver- and copper-based solders. This is particularly pronounced and advantageous with difficult to wet metallic materials such as, in particular, stainless and scale-free steels and composite materials produced by powder metallurgy. The latter include carbide metals and hard materials of metal-ceramic composite materials (e.g. so-called "cermets"), more particularly those with a;low metal content.<br>
The flux according to the invention may also be combined with soldering materials, for example, as a powder mixture, as a paste or suspension, which contain, in addition, fine-particle brazing solder in each case.<br>
Other solder-flux combinations are, for example, flux-coated solders which may be obtained, for example, by extrusion of drying or curing flux paste formulations on solder moulded parts such as rods and rings.<br><br>
8<br>
The examples given below provide typical embodiments and forms of application of the flux according to the invention:<br>
Example 1     Flux powder (FH 12 type according to DIN EN 1045)<br>
41 wt.% of potassium tetraborate 50 wt.% of potassium tetrafluoroborate 5 wt.% of potassium fluoride<br>
2 wt.% of amorphous boron (average particle size 
2 wt.% of manganese powder (average particle size 
The stated constituents are weighed out and ground and homogenised in a Diosna agitator for 15 minutes. 0.5 g of this flux are applied to a 1 cm2 carbide metal disc of SMG 02 (cerametal, cobalt content 2-3 wt.%). A 3 mm long section of solder wire of the alloy L-Ag49 (Ag4 9Cul6Zn23Mn7.5Ni4.5) is applied and the disc is heated with the oxyacetylene burner to the melting point of the solder. The liquid solder wets the entire surface of the carbide metal within a short time.<br>
For comparison, a flux of the same constituents without the activating addition of boron and manganese was prepared and tested as above. The solder melts, but wets the carbide metal only on the surface where applied. The solder does not flow over the entire surface.<br>
Example 2     Aqueous flux paste<br>
16.3 wt.% of potassium hydrogen fluoride 27.2 wt.% of potassium tetraborate<br><br>
9<br>
19.5 wt.% of potassium tetrafluoroborate<br>
0.7 wt.% of manganese dioxide (average particle size 
1.3 wt.% of amorphous boron (average particle size 
1.0 wt.% of surfactant (Marlowet PW) 34.0 wt.% of water.<br>
The corresponding amount of water is charged to a vessel with the surfactant. The remaining constituents are added successively, with stirring with a high-speed mixer, and homogenised for 30 minutes.<br>
This paste is compared in terms of its effectiveness with a commercial flux paste for brazing carbide metals (FH12 type, Degussa h special). To this end, a thin coat of each paste is applied to a sheet of stainless steel (1.4301). Circular solder discs are punched out of a 500 ?m thick solder strip of the alloy B-Ag60CuSn-600/700 and placed on the metal sheets. These are then heated to 750°C on a silver block: in a chamber oven and taken out of the oven after two minutes. After cooling, the surface area wetted with solder is measured and compared (wetting index) with the original surface area of the solder disc. The flux according to the invention provides a wetting index of 6-7 in this test, whereas the commercial flux yields a value of only 2-3.<br>
Example 3      Flux powder (FH 21 type according to DIN EN<br>
1045)<br>
35 wt.% of borax<br>
4 0 wt.% of boric acid<br>
22 wt.% of silica flour<br><br>
10<br>
1	wt.% of amorphous boron (average particle<br>
size 
2	wt.% of manganese-nickel alloy 60/40<br>
(average particle size 
The flux is prepared in a similar way to Example 1. The improvement in effectiveness is demonstrated by a T-joint soldering of galvanised steel with the brass solder L-CuZn40. To this end, a 10 cm long, galvanised steel sheet is bent at an angle of 45° and placed on a second metal sheet. A 10 mm long solder wire of brass is placed together with the flux in one corner and heated with the oxyacetylene burner to the working temperature of the solder. The solder fills the slit completely in this test when the flux according to the invention is used.<br>
In comparison, when a flux of the same formulation but without the activating addition of boron and manganese-nickel alloy is used, the solder flows only as far as the middle of the bent metal sheet.<br><br>
