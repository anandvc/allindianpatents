DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
The present invention relates to silicone products in the form of sheets, dressings, or clothing having an elastic support, covered along one side with an adhesive silicone gel along the other side with a non-adhesive silicone gel. Where the silicone product is not incorporated into clothing or garments, the exposed side, the side which does not come in contact with the skin, may be provided with an outer cover, for example, one or more polyurethane layers. Where is silicone product is incorporated into clothing or garments, said outer cover may be absent. The invention also relates to silicone products which are reusable i.e. washable.<br>
Outer cover<br>
The repeated use of these silicone products, causes a wear problem, especially along the side which does not come into contact with the skin, i.e. the side exposed to the outside world. Wear can be caused for all kinds of reasons, such as rubbing, if in constant exterior contact with other materials. Moreover, the outer side of the silicone products may clog. Furthermore, the outer side readily blackens with use, especially when worn beneath clothing; it appears unhygienic and is unpleasant or unacceptable to wear. A solution for this problem is the silicone product of the present invention comprising an outer cover to protect against friction. Said outer is disposed along the surface of the product exposed to the outside world, and which does not contact the skin.<br><br>
The outer cover may also stabilise the silicone coating in the product, preventing it from moving during normal use.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention, the outer cover comprises an ultraviolet (UV) protection function. Such protection allows faster healing and reduces the risk of UV-induced skin cancer, to which scarred and damaged tissue are susceptible. Such damaging UV rays include UV-A and UV-B radiation. According to an aspect of the invention, the UV protection function is by way of an inherent property of the outer cover and/or by additional UV<br>
protection) coatings or pigments and/or by providing layers of the cover material (e.g. one or<br>
more layers of polyurethane). According to one aspect of the invention, the UV protection factor (UPF) of the outer cover is better than 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 20, 95 or 100, and is preferably better than 50.<br>
10<br><br>
The UV screening function of the outer cover, where appropriate, may selectively admit non-damaging heat radiation.<br>
Heat, in addition to the moisture emitted by the skin, can be utilised by the product to provide therapeutic heat to the skin or scar.<br>
It is an aspect of the invention heat emitted from the body, is reflected under the product, creating an efficient 'greenhouse' effect of warming beneath the product, creating a moisture environment.<br>
In Table 1 the ultraviolet protection factors (UPF) are reproduced for socks, made in several materials by several producers, in an unstretched, relaxed state. For the silicone products the UPF only in the relaxed state are given.<br><br>

In one embodiment, the silicone product according to the invention comprises an elastic                  material which is 57% polyamide and 43% elastane (WN562), and the product has an                      elasticity of between 135% and 175% in length and elasticity of between 150% and 190% in                      width. Preferably the elastic material is covered with a silicone coating in an amount between          <br>
180 to 300 grams per square meter.<br>
Preferably the pressure garments has a elasticity between 80% and 100% in the length and width. A preferred example has a composition of polyamide 77% and elastomer 23%<br>
Preferably the silicone product of the invention comprises an elastic material which is 81% polyamides and 19% elastane, and the product has an elasticity between 165% and 205% in length and between 80% to 100% in width. Preferably the elastic material is covered with a silicone coating in an amount of 500 to 1500 grams per square meter.<br><br><br>
Tissue for the uv products is a compilation of 90% promodal ( modal 63% + lyocell 27%) and 10% elastane. The elasticity in the length is between 75% and 95% and in the width between 100% and 130%. The weight is about 210gr/m2<br><br>
A preferred example is waterproof breathable tissue composed of polyester knitted fabric (62%) with a breathable polyurethane layer (38%) having an elongation of 15 (long) and 240 across (as measured by IS013934-1).<br>
According to one aspect of the invention, the product has elasticity only in one direction, e.g. in the direction of the length of the product, or in the direction of the width, in one directly across the plane of the product. According to another aspect of the invention, the silicone product has elasticity in two directions e.g. in the direction of both the length of the product, and in the width thereto. The elasticity in the width and length may be the same or different<br>
According to an aspect of the invention, the silicone product has an elasticity in one or more given directions (e.g. length, breadth). Such directions may depend, for example, on the base elasticity of the elastic material.<br>
According to an aspect of the invention, the silicone product has a region of greater or lesser elasticity in at least part of the product, depending on the elasticity and the weave of the threads in said part of the elastic material. Such embodiments allows greater expansion, for example, in the centre of the silicone product.<br>
The use of woven or knitted elastic materials gives the additional advantage of an extremely good protection against UV radiation. This is in comparison with conventional dressing products, for example, Juzo®, Thuasnes®, Anvarex®, Maynat®, Cereplas®, Jobst®, Lymed®, Cica-care® which do not exhibit such protection. Comparison studies have shown that ScarBan ® product (see Table 1) by far has the lowest UV transmission factor and the highest ultraviolet protection factor (UPF). Such UV protection offer the advantages of reduced risk against skin cancer and faster healing times. According to an aspect of the invention, the UV protection function is by way of an inherent property of the elastic material and/or by additional UV protection coatings or pigments and/or by providing layers of the elastic material. According to one aspect of the invention, the UV protection factor (UPF) of the elastic material is better than 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 20, 95 or 100, and is preferably better (than 50.<br>
15<br><br>
The elastic property of the silicone product also provides an advantage that a tension is applied across the scar tissue. The inventors nave found that a tension supplied by the product creates a sustaining pressure which improves the healing process. Such tension may be made directional with the use of a silicone product stretchable in a single direction only (e.g. lengthways).This effect of the applied tension, combined with the 'greenhouse' effect of the product, further enhances the healing property. Such effect is especially apparent when the product is applied to tubular skin areas e.g. the limbs, neck.<br>
Silicone gel<br>
According to an embedment of the invention, a silicone gel is one known the art of scar and treatments, and is described elsewhere (e.g EP 0 251 810, WO 02/45698). Specific examples of silicone paste are provided in the Examples section below.<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention, the silicone gel forms a coating that does not permeate the fabric. This may be achieved by the elastic material chosen and the way silicone layers are coated. For example, the number of threads in both directions of the elastic material may be such that openings are a maximum of 0.1 mm2 in size, and preferentially a maximum of 0.05 mm2 in size. The silicone layers, and especially the adhesive silicone layer may set to such an extent, that it does not penetrate in the fabric.<br>
Backing layer<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the silicone product comprises a backing layer which is removed before application to the subject. The backing layer reversibly adheres to the silicone layer intended for contact with the skin of the subject. The backing layer may be made of any suitable material such as, for example, polyethylene, polythene or other polymeric substance. According to an aspect of the invention, the backing layer is smooth, or is regularly patterned with pits or grooves. Such patterns enable easy removal and reapplication of the silicone product. An example of such pattern is a diamond structure. It is an advantage that the reusable silicone product adheres reversibly to the backing layer to provide storage between periods of use.<br>
According to one aspect of the invention, the backing layer comprises a series of indented pits, arranged in diamond formations. Each pit provide an air gap when the silicone layer is<br>
16<br><br>
adhered thereto. The diamond arrangement and<br><br>
air gap facilitates the ease of removal of the<br><br>
silicone layer, so prolonging the life span during use<br>
Shapes and incorporation into garments<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention, the silicone product is covered along at least one side with a silicone coating of varied composition and cross-section. The different cross-sections, shapes, and possibilities of the silicone products comply with the requirement of different parts of the body. Examples of various shapes of product are provided is Figure 4. One silicone product may be used for several types of skin, scars; and/if suitable skin types<br>
are available, then another silicone product may be used. Examples of cross-sections include tubular for application to a limb.<br>
Where the silicone product is incorporated into garments, materials for such garment are any which have properties suitable for wearing. Properties include one or more of comfort, low/non-allergic, washability, low-shrinkage, elasticity. Examples of suitable materials include fabrics composed of polyamide and polyester.<br><br>
According to an aspect of the invention, a silicone product incorporated into a garment does not comprise an adhesive silicone layer. Such silicone products are prepared as mentioned  herein, wherein the silicone paste or gel is non-adhesive.Such products may be coated on one or both sides with non-adhesive silicone<br><br>
According to another aspect of the invention, a silicone product incorporated into a garment does not comprise an outer cover.<br><br>
According to an aspect of the invention, the<br><br>
silicone product is made into at least part of a<br><br><br><br><br>
garment which can be worn by a subject. Such garments are for example suitable for hands,<br>
arms, legs, chest, or other parts of the body stockings and limb-bands. According to an According to another aspect of the invention<br><br>
and may include gloves, mittens, socks, t-shirts, aspect of the invention, a garment is close fitting, it is made to measure. The silicone layer may<br><br>
17<br><br>
be disposed across the entire skin-contacting surface of the product, or it may be disposed in one or more regions, corresponding to at least the regions of the scar. <br>
Described silicone products can, therefore, adopt several forms and be prepared in several manners dependent on the desired application.<br>
Method of manufacture<br>
The invention also relates to a method for making silicone products. According to an aspect of the invention, a method of making a silicone product comprises the steps of:<br>
surface is covered with an outer cover,<br>
-	obtaining a double elastic material wherein one<br>
-	laying said material, outer cover side down, onto a supporting sheet,<br>
-	placing a moulding means over the non-covered surface of the elastic material and applying silicone paste or gel thereto,<br>
-	optionally removing bubbles, and<br>
-	allowing to set, thereby obtaining a silicone product of the invention<br>
The moulding means is any means of containing the silicone paste or gel over the elastic material in a shape comprising at least the desired silicone product. Such means includes a mould, a solid sheet (e.g. made of cardboard, polypropylene) having several apertures each corresponding to a shape of the product, a framework of criss-crossing rafters which define a series of apertures. The depth of the moulding means may correspond to the desired thickness of the silicone coating.<br>
According to an aspect of the invention, a method of making a silicone product comprises the steps of:<br>
-	cutting a double elastic material covered with a outer cover to the desired size,<br>
-	placing double the elastic material covered with the outer cover onto a cardboard sheet with the outer cover in contact with the cardboard,<br>
-	placing a framework onto the material and fixing the material and the framework,<br>
-	mixing a silicone paste or gel comprising more than one component and pouring the paste or gel on the material in the framework,<br>
18<br><br>
whole assembly of cardboard, elastic table where is shaken for at least 1<br>
-	optionally removing the framework and transmitting material and silicone and paste or gel onto a shaking minute, and<br>
-	allowing the silicone product to set for at least 3hours<br><br>
According to an embodiment of the invention, the new silicone products or sheets are manufactured in a following generally described manner (for example in a silicone station).<br>
Firstly, the elastic material, which is generally available on a roll, is cut into sheets of approximately 50 cm by 50 cm or other size, depending on the application. Cut sheets have 2 different sides (surfaces). It is the side which is to be covered with the polyurethane layer that is placed downwards in contact with a cardboard sheet, and which is then placed onto a coating tablet.<br>
Then a framework is laid over the elastic material. According to one embodiment of the invention, a plexiglass framework, 1.7 mm thick, is laid over the elastic material, and this whole assembly is fixed under the criss-cross arrangement of rafters. In one embodiment a hydraulic system is used to apply pressure.<br>
Once correctly arranged (no tension, wrinkles or warps in the elastic material) the silicone paste is prepared. According to one embodiment, the silicone paste comprises a mix of the a) &amp; b) silicone components according to a certain formula (described below, for example, in<br><br>
Example 1). According to one embodiment of<br><br>
he invention the total silicone paste is in the<br><br>
range of 10 to 400, 50 to 350, 100 to 300, 150 to 250 and preferably 280 grams. However,<br><br>
this quantity is among other factors dependent<br><br>
on, for example, the desired cross-section of<br><br>
the silicone layer and can, according to the aimed at application, be modified. The paste is then poured out and spread in the framework, principally on the elastic material.<br>
A spatula or squeegee which one may install on the coating tablet is used to spread the paste<br><br>
evenly within the framework, ensuring that the corners are sufficiently filled. As soon as the<br>
quantity of paste appears proportionally divided within the framework, the elastic material and silicone paste may be slid onto a separate plate to be then brought to a device for removing bubbles. Such device may be any of the art, and includes a shaking table. Where a shaking<br>
19<br><br><br>
one minute to remove bubbles efficiently from for a minimum of 3 hours.<br>
table is employed, it is used for approximately the silicone. This assembly is then allowed to set<br><br>
During that period quality control checks may be employed, where attention is paid especially to bubbles, substance particles, and other imperfections. If irregularities are present, they may be seen and the assembly is not further used. This way the quality of the end product is assured.<br>
According to an embodiment of the invention, the quality control of the adhesiveness may be exercised manually by pressing, and feeling the framework of the plate with the thumb. By this way, adhesiveness of the surface can be approved. After the quality control (adhesive strength and irregularities) the plates are covered with polythelene foil backing layer.<br>
One embodiment of the method include the use of a cardboard sheet as a framework. This has the advantage that it does not have be detached as the entire assembly can be sent to a cutting machine.<br><br>
Then the desired silicone products are cut out from sheets. This is possible by using, for example, a manual cutting table, an automatic cutting table, or using a laser cutter,  Alternatively, the desired form is punched out from sheets.<br><br><br>
According to an aspect of the invention, a method of making a silicone product comprises the steps of:<br>
-	coating a paper support with silicone paste,<br>
-	optionally allowing the paste to partially set,<br>
-	placing thereover a single elastic material wherein one surface is covered with an outer cover, such that the non-covered surface contacts the paste, and<br>
-	setting the product, thereby obtaining a silicone product of the invention.<br>
According to one embodiment, the silicone paste comprises a mix of the a) &amp; b) silicone components according to a certain formula (described below, for example, in Examples 1 and 2). According to one embodiment of the invention the total silicone paste is in the range of 10 to 400, 50 to 350, 100 to 300, 150 to 250 and preferably 180 grams per square metre.<br><br>
However, this quantity is among other factors dependent on, for example, the desired cross-section of the silicone layer and can, according to the aimed at application, be modified. Such method is described in detail in Examples 1 and 2, one or more elements of which may be applied to the above embodiment.<br><br>
According to an aspect of the invention, a method of making a silicone product comprises the steps of:<br>
product of the invention.<br>
-	coating a paper support with an adhesive silicone paste,<br>
-	optionally allowing the paste to partially set,<br>
-	placing thereover a single elastic material,<br>
-	optionally allowing the paste to partially set,<br>
-	coating the opposing surface with non-adhesive silicone paste,<br>
-	applying an outer cover<br>
-	setting the product, thereby obtaining a silicone<br><br>
According to one embodiment, the silicone paste comprises a mix of the a) &amp; b) silicone components according to a certain formula (described below, for example, in Examples 3 and 4). According to one embodiment of the invent on the total adhesive silicone paste is in the range of 100 to 800, 200 to 700, 300 to 600, 400 to 500 and preferably 180 grams per square metre. According to another embodiment of the invention the total non-adhesive silicone paste is in the range of 100 to 600, 200 to 500, 300 to 400, 500 and preferably 340 grams per square metre. However, these quantity is among other factors dependent on, for example, the desired cross-section of the silicone layer and can, according to the aimed at application, be<br>
modified. Such method is described in detail in Examples 3 and 4, one or more elements of which may be applied to the above embodiment.<br><br>
Of course, the described method above is only<br><br>
one example, and the person skilled in the art<br><br>
can adapt these embodiment further according to their needs and desired applications<br><br><br>
Carrier for other substances<br>
According to one aspect of the invention, a silicone product is a carrier for the delivery or a supply of a composition. Such composition may be any suitable to enhance the treatment. It<br><br>
21<br><br>
may comprise, for example, one or more substances which assist in the prevention of scars, for the treatment of burns, for the treatment of infections, for relieving pain. A composition may comprise, for example, moisturising cream , aloe-vera-containing cream, vitamin E formulations or combinations thereof. Composition  may be present on the surface or in pits or grooves  formed   in   the   silicone.   Alternatively the   composition   may   be   present   in microcapsules which are present in the silicone.<br><br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the silicone is mixed with microcapsules before coating onto polyamide material.<br>
The invention concerns combination also all possibilities of above described separate components of the silicone products, such as for example:                                             -a thin silicone plaster which offers certain occlusiveness,<br>
-	microcapsules that are held in the silicone layer which release substances deep into the covered parts,<br>
-	protection of feet or legs or certain pressure points or friction areas.<br>
Emulsion<br>
According to another aspect of the invention, an emulsion is applied to the scar or skin prior to the application of the silicone product, and/or after the removal of the silicone product. Such emulsion may comprise a composition as mentioned above, and have a therapeutic or cosmetic effect.<br>
Furthermore, said emulsion may comprise components, which provide one or more of the following properties:<br>
-	make putting pressure clothing on easier,<br>
-	reduce bacterial growth,<br>
-	reduce itchiness,<br>
-	provide a hydrating and softening effect.<br>
One aspect of the invention, the emulsion comprises hydrating agent and optionally barrier agent. With respect to hydration, the new formed skin is very dry and sensitive. An emulsion comprising hydrating agent and barrier agent, rehydrates the skin and reduced moisture loss<br><br>
therefrom. The healed skin is smoother. Furthermore, a well hydrated epidermis reduces<br><br>
scarring. Where the epidermis has not started to can be reduced by the application of the emulsion<br><br>
be repaired, collagen in the scarring tissue<br><br><br>
The barrier agent reduces water loss, more specifically reduces trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL). An increase of the TEWL the indicates unfavourable, and is accompanied by<br>
-  raised release of keratinosomen in the stratum granulosum of the epidermis. The<br>
keratinosomen is involved in the production of lipids for "intercellular cement" in order to form<br>
a protective water repellent film.<br>
-	accelerated, spontaneous production of keratinocytes<br><br>
The formation of the water-repellant film results in a bulge of the epidermis. The often<br>
consequence is the formation of a harsh stratum, , dryness, flaking skin. The increased TEWL<br>
also causes a feeling of stretching of the skin, and need to scratch, leading to the release of<br>
more keratinisomen and cell production, so exacerbating the problem.<br><br>
According to one aspect of the invention, the emulsion comprises anti-itching agent. Itching problem at the site of repaired skin. Scratching is damages the repaired area.<br><br>
According to one aspect of the invention, the emulsion comprises a base, dispersant (emulsifiers), active ingredient, optionally glycerine and optionally milk acid and sodium acetate, and optionally anti-microbial agent. Properties and examples of such components are provided below:<br>
Base<br>
According to an aspect of the invention, the base comprises dimethicone<br><br>
These liquid silicone oils are tolerated by the skin silicone product. These stable silicone oils spread occlusive and feel gentle and silky against the skin.<br><br>
and show no or little interaction with the well, do not feel greasy, they are semi-<br><br>
The emulsion spreads out well, because of this one does not need to apply much emulsion to the silicone product or to the skin.<br>
23<br><br><br>
According to one aspect of the invention, polydimethylsiloxane is used as a base. It is environmentally sound, exhibits no apparent toxicological effects, is non-irritating and is low/no sensitising properties.<br><br>
Emulsifier (dispersant)<br>
According to the one aspect of the present invention, an emulsifier is a non-ionic emulsifying agent, suitable for skin appliance. Such are known in the art. According to an aspect of the invention, an emulsifier has a pH between 5 and 6.<br>
According to one aspect of the invention, an emulsfier is Steareth-2 (CAS : 9005-00-9), or Polyoxyethylene (2) stearyl ether.<br>
According to one aspect of the invention, an emulsfier is Steareth-9<br><br>
According to another aspect of the invention, an 9) or Polyoxyethylene (21) stearyl ether.<br><br>
emulsifier is Steareth-21 (CAS : 009005-00-<br><br>
Active ingredient<br>
According to one aspect of the invention, an active ingredient is an agent which reduces the feeling of itchiness. Itchiness, if relieved by scratching, can damage newly repaired skin. According to an aspect of the invention, an anti-itchiness agent is laureth-9.<br>
It is also known as polidocanol or hydroxypolyethoxydodecane<br>
Laureth-9 topical anathetic gives a local anaesthesia effect. This impact is used in moderating<br>
products to reduce the tingling.<br><br><br>
Glycerine<br>
According to another aspect of the invention, an emulsion comprises glycerine.<br>
The amounts and usage of glycine are known in the art. <br>
Glycerine controls the hydrating effect of the emulsion. It improves skin flexibility. Recent studies have shown the combined impact of an improvement of the hydration stabilised barrier effect using glycerine. Both properties occur independently of each other and have <br><br>
been proved scientifically:  glycerine creates a  stimulus for barrier convalescence and<br>
improves the hydration of the stratum corneum, Furthermore, glycine is not irritating to the skin.<br><br>
even up to 7 days after finishing treatment.<br><br>
Milk acid and sodium lactate<br>
These raw materials are natural products, obtained by fermentation of sugar. Taccording to an aspect of the invention, they are a component of the emulsion. They are natural components of the skin with hydrating properties. Milk acid raises cellular turn-over of the Stratum Corneum. Usage of milk acid and sodium lactate is known in the art. The use of milk acid also has anti-microbial action (see below).<br>
Anti-microbial compounds<br>
The silicone product may also comprise one or more antibacterial agents, suitable for contact with the skin. As micro-organisms grow well in warm wet surroundings of the product applied to the skin, the product could ready emit an unpleasant odour. The low pH and the antimicrobial properties of milk acid form an unfavourable environment for micro-organisms and so reduces the embarrassing odours which may arise from the product.<br>
Uses<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention is a use of a silicone product for the treatment of skin and prevention of scars.<br>
The silicone products of the invention are characterised in particular, by their specific composition; they give an extremely good protection against UV rays.<br>

For the non-stick coating, a mixture was made of commercially available components for a silicone polyadditive product. The first component, known as part (a), a mixture of polymethylvinyl includes, polymethylhydrogenosiloxanes and silica was mixed thoroughly at room temperature in a proportion of 100/10 by weight with a second component, known as part (b), that included was a mixture of polymethylvinylsiloxanes, silica and platinum.<br>
Liquid (a) has a viscosity at 25°C of 40,000 mPa whereas liquid (b) has a viscosity at 25°C of 20,000 mPa. After mixing the fluid was degased by the application of vacuum of approximately 30 to 50 mbar. Setting was initiated at room temperature as from the moment the components were mixed.<br><br>
The mixture was coated such that the density of silicone along the free side of elastic  polyamide material was 250g per square meter. The mixture was allowed to set. The<br>
29<br><br>
temporary support was removed. The elasticity in the length direction of the composite product was 75%.<br>
The basis material was an elastic polyamiae witn me same composition such as described for WN562 above. The non-adhesive silicone coating is introduced in a proportion of 250 grams per square meter.<br>
An elastic material has 57% poiyamide and 43% elastane, and the product has an elasticity of between 135% and 175% in length and elasticity of between 150% and 190% in width. Preferably the elastic material is covered with a silicone coating in an amount between 180 to 300 grams per square meter.<br>
This silicone product is especially used to make tailor-made silicone attire, such as clothing, gloves, etc. By means of a pattern which is drawn manually and is cut, one can provide all parts of the body with silicone. In one embodiment, a tailor-made fitting uses a CAD system and automatic cutting table to cut out the patterns.<br>
Several techniques are used to put the separate pieces together such as welding, melting, stitching, ...etc.<br>
