				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention is in the field of mining and processing of coal and potassium<br>
chloride. More particularly this invention concerns the use of anionic copolymers to<br>
enhance recovery of useful coal and potassium chloride in screen bowl centrifuge<br>
separation operations.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In processing of coal and potassium chloride it is typical to use a one or more<br>
solid-liquid separation stages in order to isolate the desired solids. In all of these<br>
mining processing applications, the finest fractions of solid-liquid slurries may be<br>
subjected to screen bowl centrifugation for recovery of dewatered solids. The<br>
screenbowl centrifuge in a coal or potassium chloride processing plant is used to<br>
remove the moisture from the coal or potassium chloride. As part of the moisture<br>
removal some of the solids, usually about-40 microns in size, are lost.<br>
The screenbowl centrifuge rotates at a very high 1pm. The slurry of coal or<br>
potassium chloride enters through the feed pipe and discharges inside the machine.<br>
The solids accelerate to the high rpm portion of the machine and thus encounter high<br>
centrifugal forces. This causes the solids to move to the outside of machine and the<br>
solids are then moved toward the discharge by an auger. The liquid moves in the<br>
opposite direction and discharges as "effluent" at the "bowl drain". The effluent is<br>
typically sent to waste and thus the useful coal or potassium chloride in the effluent is<br>
lost. That is the waste that mining processing is trying to reduce. A small fraction of<br>
the liquid leaves the centrifuge at the screen drain, however, that is not the fraction of<br>
interest in this work because the amount of screen drain liquid is relatively small<br>
compared to the effluent and the screen drain liquid typically is recycled back through<br>
the process.<br>
The separation inside the machine is made at about 40 microns; greater than<br>
about 98% of the +40 micron material reports to the discharge as product along with<br><br>
about 50-70% of the -40 micron material. The remaining about 30-50% of the -40<br>
micron solids report to the effluent and are discarded.<br>
In these separations, it is always a goal to increase the amount of useful coal<br>
and potassium chloride that is recovered.<br>
In the past when flocculants were added to the feed prior to entering the<br>
machine, the high centrifugal forces inside the machine resulted in the flocculants<br>
being sheared, and thus they were not effective in capturing more solids. Therefore, it<br>
is widely accepted in the industry that flocculant addition is not effective in reducing<br>
the amount of solids being discharged in the effluent.<br>
It would be desirable to identify materials capable of flocculating coal and<br>
potassium chloride within the high shear conditions of a centrifuge separation.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The first aspect of the instant claimed invention is a method of enhancing the<br>
recovery of useful coal from screenbowl centrifuge separation operations comprising<br>
adding to the screenbowl centrifuge, from about 0.005 lbs active polymer/ton dry<br>
solids in centrifuge to about 0.70 lbs active polymer/ton dry solids in centrifuge, of an<br>
anionic copolymer, wherein said anionic copolymer is selected from the group<br>
comprising copolymers of acrylamide and acrylic acid and known salts thereof.<br>
The second aspect of the instant claimed invention is a method of enhancing the<br>
recovery of useful potassium chloride from screenbowl centrifuge separation<br>
operations comprising adding to the screenbowl centrifuge, from about 0.005 lbs active<br>
polymer/ton dry solids in centrifuge to about 0.70 lbs active polymer/ton dry solids in<br>
centrifuge, of an anionic copolymer to the screenbowl centrifuge, wherein said anionic<br>
copolymer is selected from the group comprising copolymers of acrylamide and acrylic<br>
acid and known salts thereof.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Throughout this patent application, the following terms have the indicated meanings.<br>
"AA" means acrylic acid, and its salts, including, but not limited to sodium<br>
acrylate, and ammonium acrylate,<br>
"Ac/Am" means acrylamide.<br>
"Based on polymer active" and "based on monomer" mean the amount of a<br>
reagent added based on the level of vinylic monomer in the formula, or the level of<br>
polymer formed after polymerization, assuming 100% conversion.<br>
"Based on formula" means the amount of reagent added based on the total<br>
formula weight.<br>
"Chain Transfer Agent' means any molecule, used in free-radical<br>
polymerization, which will react with a polymer radical forming a dead polymer and a<br>
new radical. Representative Chain Transfer Agents are listed by K. C. Bergef and G.<br>
Brandrup, "Transfer Constants to Monomer, Polymer, Catalyst, Solvent, and Additive<br>
in Free Radical Polymerization," Section II, pp. 81-151, in "Polymer Handbook,"<br>
edited by J. Brandrup and E. H. Immergut, 3d edition, 1989, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New<br>
York. Preferred chain transfer agents include sodium formate, 2-mercaptoethanol and<br>
isopropanol. Sodium formate is more preferred.<br>
"Coal" means a natural, solid, combustible material formed from prehistoric<br>
plant life which occurs in layers or veins in sedimentary rocks. Chemically, coal is a<br>
macromolecular network composed of groups of polynuclear aromatic rings, to which<br>
are attached subordinate rings connected to oxygen, sulfur and aliphatic bridges.<br>
"Dispersion polymer" means a dispersion of fine particles of polymer in an<br>
aqueous salt solution which is prepared by polymerizing monomers with stirring in an<br>
aqueous salt solution in which the resulting polymer is insoluble. See U.S. Pat. nos.<br>
5,708,071; 4,929,655; 5,006,590; 5,597,859; 5,597,858 and European Patent nos.<br>
657,478 and 630,909.<br>
In a typical procedure for preparing a dispersion polymer, an aqueous solution<br>
containing one or more inorganic or hydrophobic salts, one or more water-soluble<br><br>
monomers, any polymerization additives such as processing aids, chelants, pH buffers<br>
and a water-soluble stabilizer polymer is charged to a reactor equipped with a mixer, a<br>
thermocouple, a nitrogen purging tube, and a water condenser. The monomer solution<br>
is mixed vigorously, heated to the desired temperature, and then a water-soluble<br>
initiator is added. The solution is purged with nitrogen while maintaining temperature<br>
and mixing for several hours. After this time, the mixture is cooled to room<br>
temperature, and any post-polymerization additives are charged to the reactor. Water<br>
continuous dispersions of water-soluble polymers are free flowing liquids with product<br>
viscosities generally 100-10,000 cP, measured at low shear.<br>
"Gel polymer" means a polymer made by gel polymerization. In a typical<br>
procedure for preparing gel polymers, an aqueous solution containing one or more<br>
water-soluble monomers and any additional polymerization additives such as chelants,<br>
pH buffers, and the like, is prepared. This mixture is charged to a reactor equipped<br>
with a mixer, a thermocouple, a nitrogen purging tube and a water condenser. The<br>
solution is mixed vigorously, heated to the desired temperature, and then one or more<br>
water-soluble free radical polymerization initiators are added. The solution is purged<br>
with nitrogen while maintaining temperature and mixing for several hours. Typically,<br>
the viscosity of the solution increases during this period. After the polymerization is<br>
complete, the reactor contents are cooled to room temperature and then transferred to<br>
storage. Gel polymer viscosities vary widely, and are dependent upon the<br>
concentration and molecular weight of the active polymer component. Gel polymers<br>
may be dried to yield dry polymers.<br>
"Latex polymer" means a water-in-oil polymer emulsion comprising an anionic<br>
copolymer according to this invention in the aqueous phase, a hydrocarbon oil for the<br>
oil phase and one or more water-in-oil emulsifying agents. Latex polymers are<br>
hydrocarbon continuous with the water-soluble polymers dispersed within the<br>
hydrocarbon matrix. The latex polymer is "inverted" or activated for use by releasing<br>
the polymer from the particles using shear, dilution, and, generally, another surfactant.<br>
See U.S. Pat. No. 3,734,873, incorporated herein by reference. Representative<br>
preparations of high molecular weight inverse emulsion polymers are described in U.<br><br>
S. Patent No.'s 2,982,749; 3,284,393; and 3,734,873. See also, "Mechanism, Kinetics<br>
and Modeling of the Inverse-Microsuspension Homopolymerization of Acrylamide,"<br>
Hunkeler, et al., Polymer (1989), 30(1), 127-42; and "Mechanism, Kinetics and<br>
Modeling of Inverse-Microsuspension Polymerization: 2. Copolymerization of<br>
Acrylamide with Quaternary Ammonium Cationic Monomers," Hunkeler et al.,<br>
Polymer (1991), 32(14), 2626-40.<br>
Inverse emulsion polymers are prepared by dissolving the desired monomers<br>
and any polymerization additives such as inorganic salts, chelants, pH buffers, and the<br>
like in the aqueous phase, dissolving the emulsifying agent(s) in the oil phase,<br>
emulsifying the water phase in the oil phase to prepare a water-in-oil emulsion, in<br>
some cases, homogenizing the water-in-oil emulsion, polymerizing the monomers<br>
dissolved in the water phase of the water-in-oil emulsion to obtain the polymer as a<br>
water-in-oil emulsion. If so desired, a self-inverting surfactant can be added after the<br>
polymerization is complete in order to obtain the water-in-oil self-inverting emulsion.<br>
The oil phase comprises any inert hydrophobic liquid. Preferred hydrophobic<br>
liquids include aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon liquids including benzene, xylene,<br>
toluene, paraffin oil, coal, potassium chloride or borax spirits, kerosene, naphtha, and<br>
the like. A paraffinic oil is preferred.<br>
Free radical yielding initiators such as benzoyl peroxide, lauroyl peroxide, 2,2'-<br>
azobis (isobutyronitrile) (AEBN), 2,2'-azobis(2,4-dimethylvaleronitrile) (AIVN),<br>
potassium persulfate and the like are useful in polymerizing vinyl and acrylic<br>
monomers. 2,2'-azobis(isobutyronitrile) (AIBN) and 2,2'-azobis(2,4-<br>
dimethylvaleronitrile) (AIVN) are preferred. The initiator is utilized in amounts<br>
ranging between about 0.002 and about 0.2 percent by weight of the monomers,<br>
depending upon the solubility of the initiator.<br>
Water-in-oil emulsifying agents useful for preparing latex polymers include<br>
sorbitan esters of fatty acids, ethoxylated sorbitan esters of fatty acids, and the like or<br>
mixtures thereof. Preferred emulsifying agents include sorbitan monooleate,<br>
polyoxyethylene sorbitan monostearate, and the like. Additional details on these<br>
agents may be found in McCutcheon's Detergents and Emulsifiers, North American<br><br>
Edition, 1980. Any inverting surfactant or inverting surfactant mixture described in the<br>
prior art may be used. Representative inverting surfactants include ethoxylated<br>
nonylphenol, ethoxylated linear alcohols, and the like. Preferred inverting surfactants<br>
are ethoxylated linear alcohols.<br>
The polymer is selected from the group comprising polymerizing the<br>
appropriate monomers at a temperature of from about 30°C to about 85°C over about 1<br>
to about 24 hours, preferably at a temperature of from about 40°C to about 70°C over<br>
about 3 to about 6 hours. Upon completion of the reaction, the water-in-oil emulsion<br>
polymer is cooled to room temperature, where any desired post-polymerization<br>
additives, such as antioxidants, or a high HLB surfactant (as described in U.S. Patent<br>
3,734,873) may be added.<br>
The resulting emulsion polymer is a free-flowing liquid. An aqueous solution<br>
of the water-in-oil emulsion polymer can be generated by adding a desired amount of<br>
the emulsion polymer to water with vigorous mixing in the presence of a high-HLB<br>
surfactant (as described in U.S. Patent 3,734,873).<br>
"lbs" means pounds. One pound is equal to 454 grams is equal 0.454 kilograms<br>
"Nalco" means Nalco Company, 1601 W. Diehl Road, Naperville, IL 60563.<br>
(630) 305-1000.<br>
"potassium chloride" is KC1, Chemical Abstract Services Registry No. 7447-<br>
40-7. For purposes of this patent application the word "Potash" is understood to be a<br>
source of potassium chloride. Potash is currently being mined in New Mexico, U.S.A.<br>
and in Saskatchewan, Canada.<br>
"RSV" stands for Reduced Specific Viscosity. The RSV of a polymer solution<br>
is a measure of the capacity of polymer molecules to enhance the viscosity of the<br>
solution at a given concentration, which depends on the structure of the polymer<br>
molecules (including size and shape), and interaction between polymer molecules.<br>
Within a series of polymer homologs which are substantially linear and well solvated,<br>
"reduced specific viscosity (RSV)" measurements for dilute polymer solutions are an<br>
indication of polymer chain length and average molecular weight according to Paul J.<br>
Flory, in "Principles of Polymer Chemistry", Cornell University Press, Ithaca, NY.,<br><br>
1953, Chapter VII, "Determination of Molecular Weights", pp. 266-316. The RSV is<br>
measured at a given polymer concentration and temperature and calculated as follows:<br><br>
wherein r) = viscosity of polymer solution;<br>
ηo = viscosity of solvent at the same temperature; and<br>
c = concentration of polymer in solution.<br>
The units of concentration "c" are (grams/100 ml or g/deciliter). Therefore, the units of<br>
RSV are dL/g. In this patent application, for measuring RSV, the solvent used is 1.0<br>
molar sodium nitrate solution. The polymer concentration in this solvent is 0.045 g/dL<br>
as acid. The RSV is measured at 30 °C. The viscosities η and ηo are measured using a<br>
Camion Ubbelohde semimicro dilution viscometer, size 75. The viscometer is<br>
mounted in a perfectly vertical position in a constant temperature bath adjusted to 30 ±<br>
0.02 °C. The error inherent in the calculation of RSV is about 2 dl/grams. When two<br>
polymer homologs within a series have similar RSV's that is an indication that they<br>
have similar molecular weights.<br>
"ton" means 2000 pounds.<br>
The instant claimed invention is a method of enhancing the recovery of useful<br>
mined materials from screenbowl centrifuge separation operations comprising adding<br>
to the screenbowl centrifuge, from about 0.005 lbs active polymer/ton dry solids in<br>
centrifuge to about 0.70 lbs active polymer/ton dry solids in centrifuge, of an anionic<br>
copolymer, wherein said anionic copolymer is selected from the group comprising<br>
copolymers of acrylamide and acrylic acid and known salts thereof.<br>
The useful mined materials are selected from the group consisting of coal and<br>
potassium chloride.<br>
The screenbowl centrifuge separation operations can be any part of the coal or<br>
potassium chloride where a screenbowl centrifuge is used in the separation. For<br>
instance, in coal processing, typically the screenbowl centrifuge in a coal processing<br><br>
plant is used to remove the moisture from the coal, prior to the finished coal leaving<br>
the coal processing plant.<br>
The streams associated with a screenbowl include the feed, the effluent, the<br>
screen drain and the product.<br>
"Feed" is the minus 1 mm material at 25-35% solids that enters the<br>
screenbowl. The flow varies from about 350 to about 800 gallons per minute<br>
depending on the size of the machine. The percent solids can vary from about 20% to<br>
about 40% and the tons per hour of solids can be from about 20 to about 80.<br>
"Effluent" is the water and fine solids that are removed from the coal. The<br>
solids in the effluent are usually 96-98% minus 40 microns. The flow can be 250-500<br>
gpm and the tons/hr of solids depends upon the % solids. This material normally<br>
reports to the refuse thickener for disposal. This is the material that the instant<br>
claimed invention is directed to as the instant claimed invention will permit more<br>
useful coal or potassium chloride to leave the screen bowl centrifuge with the product<br>
instead of leaving the screen bowl centrifuge with the effluent.<br>
"Screen Drain" is entrained water and fine solids that are removed just prior to<br>
the coal discharging the machine. The flow is usually small, about 5% of the feed<br>
flow, and this material is recycled back into the plant.<br>
"Product" is the dried coal or the dried potassium chloride to be sold.<br>
The screenbowl rotates at a very high rpm. The coal slurry enters through the<br>
feed pipe and discharges inside the machine. The solids accelerate to the high rpm of<br>
the machine and thus encounter high centrifugal forces. This causes the solids to move<br>
to the outside of machine and the solids are then moved toward the discharge by an<br>
auger. The liquid moves in the opposite direction and discharges at the feed end. The<br>
separation inside the machine is made at about 40 microns; greater than 98% of the<br>
+40 micron material reports to the discharge as product along with about 50-60% of<br>
the -40 micron material. The remaining 40-50% of the -40 micron solids report to the<br>
effluent and are discarded.<br>
The anionic copolymers are added to the screenbowl for the purpose of<br>
capturing more of the solids from the effluent and thus having the solids report with the<br><br>
Product. In the past when flocculants were added to the feed prior to entering the<br>
machine, the high forces inside the machine resulted in the flocculants being sheared,<br>
and thus they were not effective in capturing more solids. Therefore, it was widely<br>
accepted in the industry that any type of flocculant addition was not effective in<br>
reducing the amount of solids being discharged in the effluent In contrast to what was<br>
believed to be true, with use of the anionic copolymers described herein, it has been<br>
found possible to enhance the recovery of desired coal or potassium chloride by using<br>
the anionic copolymers in centrifuge separation operations.<br>
The anionic copolymers can be made by latex polymerization, gel<br>
polymerization and dispersion polymerization techniques. It is preferred that they be<br>
made by latex polymerization, for convenience of application, and thus latex polymers<br>
are preferred for use in the instant claimed invention.<br>
Regarding the polymers, the anionic copolymers useful in the instant claimed<br>
invention are selected from the group comprising copolymers of acrylamide and acrylic<br>
acid and known salts thereof.<br>
In one preferred aspect, the anionic copolymer is selected from the group<br>
comprising copolymers of acrylamide and acrylic acid and known salts thereof,<br>
wherein the amount of acrylic acid present is about 30 mol percent.<br>
In another preferred aspect, the anionic copolymer is a copolymer of acrylamide<br>
and acrylic acid and known salts thereof wherein at least from about 10 ppm sodium<br>
formate to about 1000 ppm sodium formate had been added to the reaction mixture.<br>
The sodium formate may be added to the monomer phase or may be added later in the<br>
reaction.<br>
The anionic copolymers useful in the instant claimed invention are either<br>
available commercially from Nalco or they may be synthesized using techniques<br>
known to people of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
The total amount of polymer required to effectively enhance the recovery of<br>
useful coal or potassium chloride from centrifuge separation may vary considerably<br>
according to the characteristics of the material being fed into the screenbowl centrifuge<br>
and the degree of processing in the centrifuge required.<br><br>
Typically, the polymer is added in an amount of from about 0.005 lbs active<br>
polymer/ton dry solids in centrifuge to about 0.70 lbs active polymer/ton dry solids in<br>
centrifuge, preferably from about 0.01 lbs active polymer/ton dry solids into centrifuge<br>
to about 0.68 lbs active polymer/ton dry solids in centrifuge, and more preferably from<br>
about 0.1 lbs active polymer/ton dry solids in centrifuge to about 0.3 lbs active<br>
polymer/ton dry solids into centrifuge based on polymer actives.<br>
The dose of polymer based on lbs active polymer/lbs slurry in centrifuge,<br>
expressed in ppm, fs as follows: the polymer is added in an amount of from about 1<br>
ppm to about 140 ppm, preferably from about 1.5 ppm to about 136 ppm and more<br>
preferably from about 15 ppm to about 45 ppm based on polymer actives.<br>
To enhance the efficacy of the anionic copolymers of the instant claimed<br>
invention it is recommended to add the polymers inside the centrifuge in a low-shear<br>
zone to allow the solids to be flocculated without being torn apart by the shear forces.<br>
Preferably, the polymers are added after water and fine sized solids were separated<br>
from the larger coal particle. It is not recommended to add the polymers with the feed<br>
into the screenbowl centrifuge because if this is done, then any positive effect the<br>
polymers have upon the feed in terms of flocculation will be negated when the newly<br>
formed flocs encounter the severe shear in the centrifuge.<br>
Addition of polymer to centrifuge may be through pipes or drop chutes or any<br>
other technique known in the art.<br>
In addition to enhancing the recovery of coal, use of the anionic copolymers of<br>
this invention has also been found possible to enhance the recovery of potassium<br>
chloride.<br>
The second aspect of the instant claimed invention is a method of enhancing the<br>
recovery of useful potassium chloride from screenbowl centrifuge separation<br>
operations comprising adding to the screenbowl centrifuge, from about 0.005 lbs active<br>
polymer/ton dry solids in centrifuge to about 0.70 lbs active polymer/ton dry solids in<br>
centrifuge, of an anionic copolymer, wherein said anionic copolymer is selected from<br>
the group comprising copolymers of acrylamide and acrylic acid and known salts<br>
thereof.<br><br>
Potassium chloride is mined from Sylvite deposits, known as Potash, in New<br>
Mexico and Saskatchewan and purified by fractional crystallization or flotation. It can<br>
also be crystallized from salt lake brine and purified by recrystallization. A thorough<br>
review article of processing of potash in the mines of Saskatchewan can be found in<br>
CIM Bulletin, Vol. 96, No. 1070, pgs. 61-65, "Potash Processing in Saskatchewan--A<br>
review of process technologies" by C. F. Perucca, April 2003.<br>
When potash is being processed to yield potassium chloride, screen-bowl<br>
centrifuges are used to de-brine the concentrates from flotation bearing the valuable<br>
coal or potassium chloride. The concentrate is then dried and compacted to afford<br>
granular product for fertilizer applications or is redissolved and crystallized to afford<br>
industrial grade potassium chloride.<br>
The performance of the anionic copolymers of this invention may be monitored<br>
by means of an inert fluorescent tracer as described in U.S. Patent. No. 4,783,314,<br>
incorporated herein by reference. In particular, a composition comprising an anionic<br>
copolymer according to this invention and an inert fluorescent tracer compound in a<br>
known ratio is added to the screenbowl centrifuge containing the coal or potassium<br>
chloride slurry as described above. The fluorescent signal of the coal or potassium<br>
chloride slurry is .detected and measured using one or more fluorometers and used to<br>

thereof; and mixtures thereof. The fluorescent tracers listed above are commercially<br>
available from a variety of different chemical supply companies.<br>
The most preferred inert fluorescent tracer compound is 1,3,6,8-<br>
pyrenetetrasulfonic acid, sodium salt.<br>
The anionic copolymer and inert fluorescent tracer compound mixture is<br>
prepared by adding the inert fluorescent tracer compound with stirring to the anionic<br>
copolymer of this invention. An inverting surfactant as described herein may be added<br>
along with the inert fluorescent tracer compound. The amount of inert fluorescent<br>
tracer compound added may be readily determined by one of ordinary skill in the art,<br>
taking into consideration the polymer composition and the characteristics of the<br>
material in the screen bowl centrifuge that is being treated.<br>
One or more fluorometers are used to detect the fluorescent signal of the inert<br>
fluorescent tracers. Suitable fluorometers are selected from the group comprising<br>
Examples of fluorometers that may be used in the practice of this invention include the<br>
TRASAR® 3000 fluorometer, the TRASAR® 8000 fluorometer and the TRASAR®<br>
XE-2 Controller, which includes a fluorometer with integrated controller, all available<br>
from Nalco; the Hitachi F-4500 fluorometer (available from Hitachi through Hitachi<br>
Instruments Inc. of San Jose, CA); the JOBIN YVON FluoroMax-3 "SPEX"<br>
fluorometer (available from JOBIN YVON Inc. of Edison, NJ); and the Gilford Fluoro-<br>
IV spectrophotometer or the SFM 25 (available from Bio-tech Kontron through<br><br>
Research Instruments International of San Diego, CA). It should be appreciated that<br>
the fluorometer list is not comprehensive and is intended only to show examples of<br>
fluorometers. Other commercially available fluorometers and modifications thereof<br>
can also be used in this invention.<br>
After the fluorometer has been used to detect the fluorescent signal of the inert<br>
fluorescent tracer then the detected fluorescent signal can be converted into the actual<br>
concentration of inert fluorescent tracer using graphs that show what the detected<br>
fluorescent signal is for a specific amount of a specific inert fluorescent tracer. These<br>
graphs are known to people of ordinary skill in the art of fluorometry.<br>
Because the inert fluorescent tracer is added to the screen bowl centrifuge in a<br>
known proportion to the anionic copolymer, by detecting the fluorescent signal of the<br>
inert fluorescent tracer it is possible to calculate the amount of anionic copolymer<br>
present either in the screen bowl centrifuge or in the effluent or even in the screen<br>
drain. This enables the operator to determine whether the correct amount of anionic<br>
copolymer is present and even to determine where it is present. If desired, adjustments<br>
to the operating conditions of the screenbowl centrifuge can be made to ensure the<br>
amount of anionic copolymer present is what is supposed to be present.<br>
The following examples are intended to be illustrative of the present invention<br>
and to teach one of ordinary skill how to make and use the invention. These examples<br>
are not intended to limit the invention or its protection in any way.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1<br>
Preparation of a copolymer of acrylamide and ammonium acrylate using no sodium<br>
formate and then running the same reaction again with two different levels of sodium<br>
formate in the reaction mixture. (Not an Example of the Instant Claimed Invention)<br>
AcAm/ammonium acrylate (mol ratio of 7:3) inverse emulsion polymers were<br>
synthesized in the following manner.<br><br>
An oil phase was prepared by stirring a mixture of 243 g of paraffmic oil<br>
(Conosol C-170), 8.77 g of sorbitan monooleate, and 16.2 g of POE (5) sorbitan<br>
monooleate (22 °C).<br>
An aqueous monomer phase was made-up in the following manner. A mixture<br>
of 555.08 g of a 49.5 % acrylamide solution, 8.05 g water, and 120.04 g of acrylic acid<br>
were stirred together in a 1-L beaker and cooled in an ice bath. The ammonium salt of<br>
acrylic acid was formed by adding 2.84 g of ammonia gas to the monomer mixture<br>
while maintaining the temperature between 10-22 °C. Ammonia gas was added until a<br>
solution pH of 7.15 was obtained. Versene (EDTA.2 Na+, 0.20 g) and 0.25 g of an 8<br>
% solution of tert-butyl hydroperoxide were added to the resulting solution. Sodium<br>
formate (none for Polymer 1, 100 ppm for Polymer 2 and 550 ppm for Polymer 3) is<br>
added to the aqueous monomer phase.<br>
The oil phase was charged into a 2-L reactor. With vigorous stirring (900 rpm,<br>
10 mm rod with a teflon paddle at the base and 6-blade turbine mounted 3-inches from<br>
the bottom), the monomer phase was added over 2 minutes. The resulting mixture was<br>
stirred for 30 minutes.<br>
Polymerization is carried out under a N2 atmosphere by feeding a 0.1 %<br>
solution of sodium bisulfite at a rate of 2.12 mL/hr for the first 90 minutes then at 4.24<br>
mL/hr for 2.5 hrs. The reaction temperature is allowed to increase to and is held at 39<br>
°C during the first hour of the reaction, then is ramped to 45 °C over the remaining 3<br>
hours. At the completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture was cooled to 35 °C,<br>
and 18 g ofSynperonic L24-7 (ethoxylated linear alcohol surfactant available from<br>
Huntsman Chemical Company) was added over a period of 15 minutes. An RSV of<br>
30.5 dL/g (450 ppm, 30 °C, 1M NaNO3) and a bulk viscosity of 642 cPs (#2 spindle/30<br>
rpm) were measured for the resulting polymer.<br>
Polymers 2 and 3 (Table 1) were synthesized in a similar manner except for<br>
the level of sodium formate added to the monomer phase.<br><br><br>
Example 2<br>
The screening test for the anionic copolymers in the method of the instant<br>
claimed invention is as follows:<br>
A mixture of 40 cc of slurry and anionic copolymer, at the desired dose, is<br>
charged into a 50 mL centrifuge tube. The contents of the tube are mixed on a Fisher<br>
Vortex Genie 2™ from Fisher Scientific, dialed to 6.5 of 8 for 10 seconds. This vortex<br>
mixing is followed by centrifugation, using a Model HN-S centrifuge from<br>
International Equipment Company, Needham Heights, Massachusetts, set at Full,<br>
which reads as 2700 revolutions per minute on the tach dial for 1 min. After one<br>
minute the centrifuge is 'dialed off' and the break is applied. Following<br>
centrifugation, the contents of the tube are mixed again for 10 seconds with the same<br>
vortex mixer used previously at the same settings, at which time the nature of the floe<br>
formed is observed.<br>
In this screening study a coal slurry is used. The anionic copolymers are as<br>
follows:<br>
Polymer 1 is an Ac Am/ammonium acrylate copolymer (70/30 mol ratio) made<br>
with 0 ppm sodium formate, with an RSV of about 30.5 and a bulk viscosity of about<br>
642 cPs.<br><br>
Polymer 2 is an AcAm/ammonium acrylate copolymer (70/30 mol ratio) made<br>
with 550 ppm sodium formate, with an RSV of about 33.7 and a bulk viscosity of<br>
about 680 cPs.<br>
Polymer 3 is an AcAm/ammonium acrylate copolymer (70/30 mol ratio) made<br>
with 100 ppm sodium formate with an RSV of about 48.5 and a bulk viscosity of about<br>
684 cPs.<br>
Polymer 4 is an AcAm/ammonium acrylate copolymer (70/30 mol ratio)<br>
with an RSV of about 33 dL/g .<br>
Polymer 5 is an AcAm/sodium acrylate copolymer (70/30 mol ratio)<br>
with an RSV of about 33 dL/g. '<br>
Polymer 6 is an AcAm/sodium acrylate copolymer (70/30 mol ratio)<br>
with an RSV of about 37 dL/g.<br>
Polymer 7 is an AcAm/sodium acrylate copolymer (70/30 mol ratio)<br>
with an RSV of about 35 dL/g.<br><br><br><br>
Note: tests 1 and 8 are not examples of the instant claimed invention..<br>
"o/f' stands for overflow, which is the liquid layer above the solid<br>
layer.<br>
"disrupted" means cake enters overflow.<br>
"not disrupted" means cake doesn't enter overflow.<br>
The observations recorded in this table show that the indicated anionic<br>
copolymers are effective in flocculating the coal in the slurry under the harsh vibration-<br>
centrifugation-vibration conditions of the test.<br>
By using this screening test, it is found that polymers that perform well in high-<br>
shear field applications are those that have the ability to form a large floe when mixed<br>
on the vortex mixer prior to and following centrifugation.<br>
In a large scale coal processing plant for example, the recovered fine coal is<br>
saleable and would afford an additional source of revenue. As an example, a typical<br>
coal production plant site can process about 6,000 tons/day through the screen bowl<br>
centrifuges. The improvement in effluent solids described here would afford about 150<br>
tons/day, currently saleable at about $15-$30/ton.<br>
Various changes and modifications to the presently preferred embodiments<br>
described herein will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and<br>
modifications can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the present<br>
invention and without diminishing its attendant advantages. It is therefore intended<br>
that such changes and modifications be covered by the appended claims.<br><br><br><br>
