FUSION PARTNER PROTEIN<br>
The present invention relates to fusion partners which act as immunological fusion<br>
partners, as expression enhancers, and preferably to fusion partners having both<br>
functions. The invention also relates to fusion proteins containing them, to their<br>
manufacture, to their use in vaccines and to their use in medicines. In particular fusion<br>
partners are provided that contain a so-called choline binding domain, for example fusions<br>
comprising LytA from Streptococcus pneumoniae, or the pneumococcal phage CP1<br>
lysozyme (CPU) wherein the choline binding domain is modified to include a heterologous<br>
T-helper epitope. Such fusion partners are shown to improve the expression level of the<br>
heterologous protein attached thereto and also find particular utility when fused to poorly<br>
immunogenic proteins or peptides that are otherwise useful as vaccine antigens. More<br>
particularly, such fusion partners are useful in constructs comprising self-antigens, eg<br>
tumour specific or tissue specific antigens.<br>
Background to the invention<br>
Streptococcus pneumoniae synthesises an N acetyl-L-alanine amidase, LytA, an autolysin<br>
that specifically degrades the peptidoglycan backbone of the cell wall eventually leading to<br>
cell lysis. Its polypeptide chain has two domains. The N-terminal domain is responsible for<br>
the catalytic activity, whereas the C-terminal domain of LytA is responsible for the affinity<br>
to choline and anchorage to the cell wall. This C-terminal domain is known to bind to<br>
choline and choline analogues, and will also bind to tertiary amines such as DEAE (diethyl<br>
amino ethyl) commonly used in chromatography.<br>
LytA is a 318 amino acid protein, and the C-terminal part comprises a tandem of six<br>
imperfect repeats of 20 or 21 amino acids and a short COOH-terminal tail. The repeats are<br>
located at the following positions:<br>
R1: 177-191<br>
R2: 192-212<br>
R3: 213-234<br>
R4: 235-254<br>
R5: 255-275<br>
R6: 276-298<br>
These repeats are predicted to be in a beta-turn conformation. The C-terminus is<br>
responsible for binding choline. Likewise the C-terminus of CPL1 is responsible for binding<br>
affinity and the aromatic residues in the repeat contribute to such binding. These proteins<br>
have been used as affinity tags to allow for rapid purification (Sanchez Puelles, Eur J<br>
Biochem. 1992, 203,153-9).<br>
Other proteins with a choline-binding domain have also been studied in Streptococcus<br>
pneumoniae.<br>
One of them PspA (or Pneumococcal Surface Protein A), is a virulence factor (Yother J<br>
and Briles (1992) J Bacterid 174(2) p 601). This protein is antigenic and immunogenic. It<br>
has a C-terminal domain consisting of 10 repeats of 20 amino acids, homologous with<br>
repeats of LytA.<br>
CbpA (or Choline-Binding Protein A) is involved in the adherence of the pneumococcus to<br>
human cells (Rosenow et al (1997) Mol Microbiol 25 (5) d 819). It shows 10 repeats of 20<br>
amino acids in the C-terminal domain which are almost identical to those of PspA.<br>
LytB and LytC have a different modular organisation from the above-mentioned proteins as<br>
their choline-binding domain, made up of 15 repeats and 11 repeats respectively, is<br>
situated at the N-terminal end, not at the C-terminal end (Garcia P Mol Microbiol (1999) 31<br>
(4) p1275 and Garcia P et al (1999) Mol Microbiol 33(1) p128). Sequence comparison<br>
shows LytB to have glucosamidase activity. LytC shows in vitro a lysozyme-type activity.<br>
Additionally, three genes called PepA, PepB and PepC were cloned in 1995. Although<br>
their function is unknown, these genes also have a variable number of repeats<br>
homologous to those of LytA.<br>
In their infection cycle, phages synthesise murein hydrolases facilitating their passage into<br>
the bacterium. These hydrolases have a choline-binding domain.<br>
The muramidase CPL1 of the phage Cp-1 has been well studied. It shows 6 repeats of 20<br>
amino acids at the C-terminus involved in the specific recognition of choline (Garica J. L. J.<br>
Virolgi (8) P2573-80; (1987) and Garcia E Prol Natl Acad Sci (1988) p914). A<br>
comparison of the LytA and CPL1 repeats enables an initial consensus of those repeats to<br>
be made.<br>
The murein hydrolases of phages Dp-1 (Garcia P et al (1983) J Gen.,Microbiol_129 (2)<br>
p489, Cpl-9 (Garcia P et al (1989) Biochem Biophys_Res Commun 158(1) p 251. HB-3<br>
Romero et al 1990 J Bacteriol 172 (9) p.5064-5070) and EJ-1 Diaz (1992) J Bacterid 174<br>
(17) p5516), also show the characteristics of choline-binding domains.<br>
This property is also shared by the lysozyme encoded by CP-1 a pneumococcal phage.<br>
WO 99/10375 describes inter alia, human papilloma virus proteins E6, or E7 linked to a His<br>
tag and the C-terminal portion of LytA (herein (C-LytA) and the purification of the proteins<br>
by differential affinity chromatography.<br>
WO 99/40188 describes inter alia fusion proteins comprising MAGE antigens with a His<br>
tails and a C-LytA portion at the N-terminus of the molecule.<br>
It has now been surprisingly found that fusion partners according to the present invention,<br>
when fused to a heterologous protein were capable of enhancing the immunogenicity of<br>
the heterologous proteins attached thereto. It has also been found that the expression<br>
level of the heterologous proteins attached thereto can be enhanced. The present<br>
invention accordingly provides in a preferred embodiment an improved immunological<br>
fusion partner which can also act as an expression enhancer.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
Accordingly the present invention comprises a fusion partner molecule comprising a<br>
choline binding domain or a fragment thereof or an analogue thereof, and a heterologous<br>
promiscuous T helper epitope, preferably a promiscuous MHC Class II T-epitope. Said<br>
fusion partner shows a capability of acting as both an immunological fusion partner, or as<br>
an expression enhancer and preferably as both an immunological partner and expression<br>
enhancer. A promiscuous T-helper epitope is an epitope that binds to more than one MHC<br>
Class II allele, preferably more than 3 MHC Class II alleles. In particular such epitopes are<br>
capable of eliciting helper T cell response in large numbers of individuals expressing<br>
diverse MHC haplotypes. Optionally, the fusion protein may retain its capability to bind to<br>
choline.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the choline binding moiety is derived from the C terminus of<br>
LytA. Preferably the C-LytA or derivatives comprises at least four repeats of any of the<br>
repeats R1 to R6 set forth in figure 1 (SEQ ID NO:1 to 6). In a most preferred embodiment,<br>
the C-LytA extends from amino acid 177-298 which contains a portion of the first repeat<br>
and the complete five others.<br>
In a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a fusion partner as herein defined<br>
further comprising a heterologous protein. The heterologous protein is either<br>
chemically conjugated or fused to the fusion partner. Preferably the heterologous protein is<br>
a tumour-associated antigen or immunogenic fragment thereof.<br>
In a further aspect of the invention there is provided a nucleic acid sequence encoding the<br>
proteins as herein defined. There is also provided an expression vector comprising said<br>
nucleic acid, and a host transformed with said nucleic acid or vector.<br>
In a further aspect of the invention there is provided an immunogenic composition<br>
comprising a protein or a nucleic acid sequence as herein described, and a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, diluent or carrier. Preferably the immunogenic<br>
composition further comprises a Th-1 inducing adjuvant.<br>
In yet a further embodiment, the invention provides the immunogenic composition or<br>
protein and nucleic acids for use in medicine. In particular, there is provided a protein or a<br>
nucleic acid of the invention, in the manufacture of a medicament for eliciting an immune<br>
response in a patient, or for use in the treatment or prophylaxis of infectious diseases or<br>
cancer diseases.<br>
The invention further provides for methods of treating a patient suffering from an infectious<br>
disease or a cancer disease, particularly carcinoma of the breast, lung (particularly non -<br>
small cell lung carcinoma), colorectal, ovarian, prostate, gastric and other Gl<br>
(gastrointestinal) by the administration of a safe and effective amount of a composition or<br>
nucleic acid as herein described.<br>
In yet a further embodiment the invention provides a method of producing an immunogenic<br>
composition as herein described by admixing a nucleic acid or protein of the invention with<br>
a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, diluent or carrier.<br>
Detailed description of the Invention<br>
As described therein, in one embodiment of the present invention the modified choline<br>
binding domain (fusion partner) has a capability of acting as an expression enhancer with<br>
the resulting fusion protein will be expressed at a higher yield in a host cell as compared to<br>
the unfused protein, preferably at a yield greater than about 100% (2-fold higher) or 150%<br>
or more, as measured by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie blue staining or silver<br>
staining, optionally followed by gel scanning. The modified choline binding domain<br>
according to the invention has also the capability of acting as an immunological partner<br>
with the resulting fusion protein with a heterologous protein will be more immunogenic in a<br>
host as compared to the unfused heterologous protein.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the modified choline binding domain has<br>
the capability to act as an immunological fusion partner, allowing an enhanced immune<br>
response to be obtained with the fusion protein as compared to the heterologous protein<br>
alone.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the modified choline binding domain has a dual function,<br>
having the capability to act as both an immunological fusion partner and as an expression<br>
enhancer.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the choline binding moiety is derived from the C terminus of<br>
LytA. Preferably the C-LytA or derivatives comprises at least two repeats, preferably at<br>
least four repeats. In this context, C-LytA derivatives refer to a variant of C-LytA according<br>
to the present invention, that is to say variants which have retained both the capability of<br>
acting as an immunological partner and an expression enhancer. Preferred variants<br>
include, for example, peptides comprising an amino acid sequence having at least 85%<br>
identity, preferably at least 90% identity, more preferably at least 95% identity, most<br>
preferably at least 97-99% identity, to any of the repeats R1 to R6 set forth in figure 1<br>
(SEQ ID NO:1 to 6), or a peptide comprising an amino acid sequence having at least 15,<br>
20, 30, 40, 50 or 100 contiguous amino acids from the amino acid sequence set forth in<br>
figure 1 (SEQ ID NO: 1 to 8).<br>
Accordingly, in one aspect of the invention there is provided a fusion partner protein<br>
comprising a modified choline binding domain and a heterologous promiscuous T helper<br>
epitope, wherein the choline binding domain is selected from the group comprising:<br>
a) the C-terminal domain of LytA as set forth in SEQ ID NO:7;<br>
b) the sequence of SEQ ID NO:8;<br>
c) a peptide sequence comprising an amino acid sequence having at least 85%<br>
identity, preferably at least 90% identity, more preferably at least 95% identity,<br>
most preferably at least 97-99% identity, to any of SEQ ID NO:1 to 6;<br>
d) a peptide sequence comprising an amino acid sequence having at least 15, 20,<br>
30, 40, 50 or 100 contiguous amino acids from the amino acid sequence of SEQ<br>
ID NO:7 or SEQ ID NO:8.<br>
In a most preferred embodiment, the C-LytA extends from amino acid 177-298 which<br>
contains a portion of the first repeat and the complete five others, as set forth in figure 1.<br>
The second component of the fusion partner, the heterologous T-cell epitope is preferably<br>
selected from the group of epitopes that will bind to a number of individuals expressing<br>
more than one MHC II molecules in humans. For example, epitopes that are specifically<br>
contemplated are P2 and P30 epitopes from tetanus toxoid, Panina - Bordignon Eur. J.<br>
Immunol 19 (12), 2237 (1989). In a preferred embodiment the heterologous T-cell epitope<br>
is P2 or P30 from Tetanus toxin.<br>
The P2 epitope has the sequence QYIKANSKFIGITE and corresponds to amino acids<br>
830-843 of the Tetanus toxin. The P30 epitope (residues 947-967 of Tetanus Toxin) has<br>
the sequence FNNFTVSFWLRVPKVSASHLE. The FNNFTV sequence may optionally be<br>
deleted. Other universal T epitopes can be derived from the circumsporozoite protein from<br>
Plasmodium falciparum - in particular the region 378-398 having the sequence<br>
DIEKKIAKMEKASSVFNWNS (Alexander J, (1994) Immunity 1 (9), p 751-761). Another<br>
epitope is derived from Measles virus fusion protein at residue 288-302 having the<br>
sequence LSEIKGVIVHRLEGV (Partidos CD, 1990, J. Gen. Virol 71(9) 2099-2105). Yet<br>
another epitope is derived from hepatitis B virus surface antigen, in particular amino acids,<br>
having the sequence FFLLTRILTIPQSLD. Another set of epitopes is derived from<br>
diphteria toxin. Four of these peptides (amino acids 271-290, 321-340, 331-350, 351-370)<br>
map within the T domain of fragment B of the toxin, and the remaining 2 map in the R<br>
domain (411-430,431-450):<br>

(Raju R., Navaneetham D., Okita D., Diethelm-Okita B., McCormick D., Conti-Fine B. M.<br>
(1995) Eur. J. Immunol. 25: 3207-14.)<br>
The heterologous T-epitope is preferably fused to C-LytA containing at least 4 repeats,<br>
preferably repeat 2 -5 inclusive. One or more subsequent repeats may optionally be fused<br>
to the C-terminus of the T-epitope. Alternatively, the heterologous T-epitope is preferably<br>
inserted between two consecutive repeats of C-LytA containing a total of at least 4<br>
repeats, or inserted into one of the repeats of C-LytA containing a total of at least 4<br>
repeats. More preferably, the C-LytA contains 6 repeats and the heterologous epitope is<br>
inserted within and at the beginning of the sixth repeat of C-LytA.<br>
The present invention further provides, in other aspects, fusion proteins that comprise at<br>
least one polypeptide as described above, as well as polynucleotides encoding such fusion<br>
proteins, typically in the form of pharmaceutical compositions, e.g., vaccine compositions,<br>
comprising a physiologically acceptable carrier and/or an immunostimulant.<br>
Thus a self-protein or other poorly immunogenic protein may be fused to either the N or C<br>
terminal end of the resulting fusion partner. Alternatively the self protein or poorly<br>
immunogenic protein may be inserted into the fusion partner. In an optional embodiment a<br>
histidine tag or at least four, preferably more than 6 histidine residues, may be fused to the<br>
alternative end of the poorly immunogenic protein. This would allow for the protein to be<br>
purified by affinity chromatography steps, as a histidine tail, typically comprising at least<br>
four, preferably six or more residues binds to metal ions and therefore is suitable for metal<br>
immobilised metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC).<br>
Typical constructs would therefore comprise:<br>
- Poorly- immunogenic protein - C-LytA repeats1-4 -P2 epitope (inserted in or replacing C-<br>
LytA repeat5)-C-LytA repeate<br>
- C-LytA repeats1-4 -P2 epitope (inserted in or replacing C-LytA repeats) - C-LytA repeate-<br>
Poorly immunogenic protein<br>
- Poorly immunogenic protein - C-LytA repeat2-5 -P2 epitope (inserted into C-LytA repeate)<br>
- C-LytA2-5 -P2 epitope (inserted into C-LytA repeate)- Poorly immunogenic protein.<br>

- Poorly immunogenic protein-C-LytA repeat1-P2 epitope inserted into C-LytA repeat2-C-<br>
LytA repeats3-6<br>
- C-LytA repeat1-P2 epitope inserted into C-LytA repeat2-C-LytA repeats3-6- Poorly<br>
immunogenic protein;<br>
where "inserted into" means at any place into the repeat for example between residue 1<br>
and 2, or between 2 and 3, etc.<br>
The promiscuous T helper epitope may be inserted within a repeat region for example C-<br>
LytA repeats 2-5 - C-LytA repeat 6a-P2 epitope - C-LytA repeat 6b, where the P2 epitope<br>
is inserted within the sixth repeat (see figure 2).<br>
In other preferred embodiments the C-terminal end of CPL1 (C-CPL1) may be used as an<br>
alternative to C-LytA.<br>
Alternatively, the P2 epitope in the above constructs may be replaced by other<br>
promiscuous T epitopes, for example P30. In an embodiment of the invention, two or more<br>
promiscuous epitopes are part of the fusion construct. It is however preferred to keep the<br>
fusion partner as small as possible, thus limiting the number of potentially interfering CD8+<br>
and B epitopes. Thus the fusion partner is preferably no bigger than 100-140 amino acids,<br>
preferably no bigger than 120 amino acids, typically about 100 amino acid.<br>
The antigen to which the fusion partner is fused may be from bacterial, viral, protozoan,<br>
fungal or mammalian, including human, sources.<br>
The fusion partner of the present invention are preferably fused to a self antigen such as a<br>
tumour associated or tissue specific antigens such as those for prostrate, breast,<br>
colorectal, lung, pancreatic, ovarian, renal or melanoma cancers. Fragments of said self or<br>
tumour antigens are expressly contemplated to be fused to the fusion partner of the<br>
invention. Typically the fragment will contain at least 20, preferably 50, more preferably<br>
100 contiguous amino acids of the full-length sequence. Typically such fragments will be<br>
devoid of one or more transmembrane domains or may have N-terminal or C-terminal<br>
deletions of about 3, 5 , 8, 10, 15, 20, 28 , 33, 50, 54 amino acids. Such fragments will,<br>
when suitably presented, be able to generate immune responses that recognise the full<br>
length protein.Particularly illustrative polypeptides of the present invention comprise a<br>
sequence of at least 10 contiguous amino acids, preferably 20, more preferably 30, 40, 50,<br>
60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170, 180 amino acids of a tumour<br>
associated or tissue specific protein fused to the fusion partner.<br>
The polypeptides of the invention are immunogenic, i.e., they react detectably within an<br>
immunoassay (such as an ELISA or T-cell stimulation assay) with antisera and/or T-cells<br>
from a patient with cripto expressing cancer. Screening for immunogenic activity can be<br>
performed using techniques well known to the skilled artisan. For example, such screens<br>
can be performed using methods such as those described in Harlow and Lane, Antibodies:<br>
A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, 1988. In one illustrative example, a<br>
polypeptide may be immobilised on a solid support and contacted with patient sera to allow<br>
binding of antibodies within the sera to the immobilised polypeptide. Unbound sera may<br>
then be removed and bound antibodies detected using, for example, 125l-labeled Protein A.<br>
As would be recognised by the skilled artisan, immunogenic portions of tumour associated<br>
or tumour specific antigen are also encompassed by the present invention. An<br>
"immunogenic portion" as used herein, is a fragment that itself is immunologically reactive<br>
(i.e., specifically binds) with the B-cells and/or T-cell surface antigen receptors that<br>
recognize the polypeptide. Immunogenic portions may generally be identified using well<br>
known techniques, such as those summarized in Paul, Fundamental Immunology, 3rd ed.,<br>
243-247 (Raven Press, 1993) and references cited therein. Such techniques include<br>
screening polypeptides for the ability to react with antigen-specific antibodies, antisera<br>
and/or T-cell lines or clones. As used herein, antisera and antibodies are "antigen-<br>
specific" if they specifically bind to an antigen (i.e., they react with the protein in an ELISA<br>
or other immunoassay, and do not react detectably with unrelated proteins). Such antisera<br>
and antibodies may be prepared as described herein, and using well-known techniques.<br>
In one preferred embodiment, an immunogenic portion of a polypeptide is a portion that<br>
reacts with antisera and/or T-cells at a level that is not substantially less than the reactivity<br>
of the full-length polypeptide (e.g., in an ELISA and/or T-cell reactivity assay). Preferably,<br>
the level of immunogenic activity of the immunogenic portion is at least about 50%,<br>
preferably at least about 70% and most preferably greater than about 90% of the<br>

published under Number WO 93/10152 claiming priority from UK patent application<br>
No.9124390.7. When expressed in yeast RTS is produced as a lipoprotein particle, and<br>

RTS,S and TRAP antigens. Other Plasmodia antigens that are likely candidates to be<br>
components of the fusion are P. faciparum MSP1, AMA1, MSP3, EBA, GLURP, RAP1,<br>
RAP2, Sequestrin, PfEMPI, Pf332, LSA1, LSA3, STARP, SALSA, PfEXPI, Pfs25, Pfs28,<br>
PFS27/25, Pfs16. Pfs48/45, Pfs230 and their analogues in Plasmodium spp.<br>
The present invention also provides a polynucleotide encoding the fusion partner<br>
according to the present invention. The invention further relates a polynucleotide that<br>
hybridise to the polynucleotide sequence provided herein in figure 1 (SEQ ID NO:9 to 16).<br>
In this regard, the invention especially relates to polynucleotides that hybridise under<br>
stringent conditions to the polynucleotide described herein. As herein used, the terms<br>
"stringent conditions" and "stringent hybridisation conditions" mean hybridisation occurring<br>
only if there is at least 95% and preferably at least 97% identity between the sequences. A<br>
specific example of stringent hybridization conditions is overnight incubation at 42°C in a<br>
solution comprising: 50% formamide, 5x SSC (150mM NaCI, 15mM trisodium citrate), 50<br>
mM sodium phosphate (pH7.6), 5x Denhardt"s solution, 10% dextran sulfate, and 20<br>
micrograms/ml of denatured, sheared salmon sperm DNA, followed by washing the<br>
hybridisation support in 0.1 x SSC at about 65°C. Hybridisation and wash conditions are<br>
well known and exemplified in Sambrook, et a/., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual,<br>
Second Edition, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., (1989), particularly Chapter 11 therein. Solution<br>
hybridisation may also be used with the polynucleotide sequences provided by the<br>
invention.<br>
The present invention also provides a polynucleotide encoding the polypeptide comprising<br>
the fusion partner according to the present invention fused to a tumour associated antigen<br>
or fragment thereof. In particular, the present invention provides for polynucleotide<br>
sequences encoding a fusion partner protein comprising a choline binding domain and a<br>
heterologous promiscuous T neper epitope, preferably wherein the choline binding domain<br>
is derived from the C terminus of LytA. In a more preferred embodiment, the C-LytA moiety<br>
of the polynucleotides according to the invention comprise at least four repeats of any of<br>
SEQ ID NO.9-14, more preferably comprise the sequence of SEQ ID NO.15, still more<br>
preferably the sequence of SEQ ID NO. 16. In other related embodiments, the present<br>
invention provides for polynucleotide variants having substantial identity to the sequences<br>
disclosed herein in SEQ ID NOs:9-16, for example those comprising at least 70%<br>
sequence identity, preferably at least 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99%<br>
or higher, sequence identity compared to a polynucleotide sequence of this invention using<br>
conventional methods, e.g., BLAST analysis using standard parameters. In a still further<br>
embodiment the polynucleotide as claimed further comprises a heterologous protein.<br>
Such polynucleotide sequences can be inserted into a suitable expression vector and<br>
expressed in a suitable host. Vectors may be provided which encode the modified choline<br>
binding protein of the invention and which contain a suitable restriction site into which a<br>
DNA encoding a poorly immunogenic protein can be inserted to produce a fusion protein.<br>
In other embodiments of the invention, polynucleotide sequences or fragments thereof<br>
which encode polypeptide fusions of the invention, may be used in recombinant DNA<br>
molecules to direct expression of a polypeptide in appropriate host cells. Due to the<br>
inherent degeneracy of the genetic code, other DNA sequences that encode substantially<br>
the same or a functionally equivalent amino acid sequence may be produced and these<br>
sequences may be used to clone and express a given polypeptide.<br>
As will be understood by those of skill in the art, it may be advantageous in some<br>
instances to produce polypeptide-encoding nucleotide sequences possessing non-<br>
naturally occurring codons. The DNA code has 4 letters (A, T, C and G) and uses these to<br>
spell three letter "codons" which represent the amino acids the proteins encodes in an<br>
organism"s genes. The linear sequence of codons along the DNA molecule is translated<br>
into the linear sequence of amino acids in the protein(s) encoded by those genes. The<br>
code is highly degenerate, with 61 codons coding for the 20 natural amino acids and 3<br>
codons representing "stop" signals. Thus, most amino acids are coded for by more than<br>
one codon - in fact several are coded for by four or more different codons.<br>
Where more than one codon is available to code for a given amino acid, it has been<br>
observed that the codon usage patterns of organisms are highly non-random. Different<br>
species show a different bias in their codon selection and, furthermore, utilisation of<br>
codons may be markedly different in a single species between genes which are expressed<br>
at high and low levels. This bias is different in viruses, plants, bacteria and mammalian<br>
cells, and some species show a stronger bias away from a random codon selection than<br>
others. For example, humans and other mammals are less strongly biased than certain<br>
bacteria or viruses. For these reasons, there is a significant probability that a mammalian<br>
gene expressed in E.coli or a viral gene expressed in mammalian cells will have an<br>
inappropriate distribution of codons for efficient expression. It is believed that the<br>
presence in a heterologous DNA sequence of clusters of codons which are rarely<br>
observed in the host in which expression is to occur, is predictive of low heterologous<br>
expression levels in that host.<br>
In consequence, codons preferred by a particular prokaryotic (for example E. coli or yeast)<br>
or eukaryotic host can be optimised, that is selected to increase the rate of protein<br>
expression, to produce a recombinant RNA transcript having desirable properties, such as<br>
for example a half-life which is longer than that of a transcript generated from the naturally<br>
occurring sequence, or to optimise the immune response in humans. The process of<br>
codon optimisation may include any sequence, generated either manually or by computer<br>
software, where some or all of the codons of the native sequence are modified. Several<br>
methods have been published (Nakamura et.al., Nucleic Acids Research 1996, 24:214-<br>
215; WO98/34640). One preferred method according to this invention is Syngene method,<br>
a modification of Calcgene method (R. S. Hale and G Thompson (Protein Expression and<br>
Purification Vol. 12 pp.185-188 (1998)).<br>
Accordingly in a preferred embodiment the DNA sequence of the protein has a RSCU<br>
(Relative synomons Codon useage (also known as Codon Index CI)) of at least 0.65 and<br>
have less than 85% identity to the corresponding wild type region.<br>
This process of codon optimisation and the resulting constructs are advantageous as they<br>
may have some or all of the following benefits: 1) to improve expression of the gene<br>
product by replacing rare or infrequently used codons with more frequently used codons,<br>
2) to remove or include restriction enzyme sites to facilitate downstream cloning and 3) to<br>
reduce the potential for homologous recombination between the insert sequence in the<br>
DNA vector and genomic sequences and 4) to improve the immune response in humans<br>
by raising a cellular and/or an antibody response (preferably both responses) against the<br>
target antigen. The sequences of the present invention advantageously have reduced<br>
recombination potential, but express to at least the same level as the wild type sequences.<br>
Due to the nature of the algorithms used by the SynGene programme to generate a codon<br>
optimised sequence, it is possible to generate an extremely large number of different<br>
codon optimised sequences which will perform a similar function. In brief, the codons are<br>
assigned using a statistical method to give synthetic gene having a codon frequency closer<br>
to that found naturally in highly expressed E.coli and human genes. In brief, the codons<br>
are assigned using a statistical method to give synthetic gene having a codon frequency<br>
closer to that found naturally in highly expressed human genes such as b-Actin.<br>
Illustrative, although non limiting, examples of suitable codon-optimised sequences are<br>
given in SEQ ID NOs:19-22 and SEQ ID NOs:24-26.<br>
In the polynucleotides of the present invention, the codon usage pattern is altered from<br>
that typical of the target antigen to more closely represent the codon bias of a highly<br>
expressed gene in a target organism, for example human b-actin. The "codon usage<br>
coefficient" is a measure of how closely the codon pattern of a given polynucleotide<br>
sequence resembles that of a target species. Codon frequencies can be derived from<br>
literature sources for the highly expressed genes of many species (see e.g. Nakamura<br>
et.al. Nucleic Acids Research 1996, 24:214-215). The codon frequencies for each of the<br>
61 codons (expressed as the number of occurrences occurrence per 1000 codons of the<br>
selected class of genes) are normalised for each of the twenty natural amino acids, so that<br>
the value for the most frequently used codon for each amino acid is set to 1 and the<br>
frequencies for the less common codons are scaled to lie between zero and 1. Thus each<br>
of the 61 codons is assigned a value of 1 or lower for the highly expressed genes of the<br>
target species. In order to calculate a codon usage coefficient for a specific polynucleotide,<br>
relative to the highly expressed genes of that species, the scaled value for each codon of<br>
the specific polynucleotide are noted and the geometric mean of all these values is taken<br>
(by dividing the sum of the natural logs of these values by the total number of codons and<br>
take the anti-log). The coefficient will have a value between zero and 1 and the higher the<br>
coefficient the more codons in the polynucleotide are frequently used codons. If a<br>
polynucleotide sequence has a codon usage coefficient of 1, all of the codons are "most<br>
frequent" codons for highly expressed genes of the target species.<br>
According to the present invention, the codon usage pattern of the polynucleotide will<br>
preferably exclude codons representing 
acid. A relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) value is the observed number of<br>
codons divided by the number expected if all codons for that amino acid were used equally<br>
frequently. A polynucleotide of the present invention will preferably exclude codons with<br>
an RSCU value of less than 0.2 in highly expressed genes of the target organism. A<br>
polynucleotide of the present invention will generally have a codon usage coefficient for<br>
highly expressed human genes of greater than 0.6, preferably greater than 0.65, most<br>
preferably greater than 0.7. Codon usage tables for human can also be found in Genbank.<br>
In comparison, a highly expressed beta actin gene has a RSCU of 0.747.<br>
The codon usage table (Table 1) for a homo sapiens is set out below:<br>
Table 1. Codon usage for human (highly expressed) genes 1/24/91 (human_high.cod)<br>
A DNA sequence encoding the fusion proteins or modified choline binding protein of the<br>
present invention can be synthesised using standard DNA synthesis techniques, such as<br>
by enzymatic ligation as described by D.M. Roberts et al. in Biochemistry 1985, 24, 5090-<br>
5098, by chemical synthesis, by in vitro enzymatic polymerisation, or by PCR technology<br>
utilising for example a heat stable polymerase, or by a combination of these techniques.<br>
Enzymatic polymerisation of DNA may be carried out in vitro using a DNA polymerase<br>
such as DNA polymerase I (Klenow fragment) or Taq polymerase in an appropriate buffer<br>
containing the nucleoside triphosphates dATP, dCTP, dGTP and dTTP as required at a<br>
temperature of 10°-37°C, generally in a volume of 50pl or less. Enzymatic ligation of DNA<br>
fragments may be carried out using a DNA ligase such as T4 DNA ligase in an appropriate<br>
buffer, such as 0.05M Tris (pH 7.4), 0.01 M MgCI2, 0.01 M dithiothreitol, 1mM spermidine,<br>
1mM ATP and 0.1mg/ml bovine serum albumin, at a temperature of 4°C to ambient,<br>
generally in a volume of 50 ml or less. The chemical synthesis of the DNA polymer or<br>
fragments may be carried out by conventional phosphotriester, phosphate or<br>
phosphoramidite chemistry, using solid phase techniques such as those described in<br>
"Chemical and Enzymatic Synthesis of Gene Fragments - A Laboratory Manual" (ed. H.G.<br>
Gassen and A. Lang), Verlag Chemie, Weinheim (1982), or in other scientific publications,<br>
for example M.J. Gait, H.W.D. Matthes, M. Singh, B.S. Sproat, and R.C. Titmas, Nucleic<br>

The process of the invention may be performed by conventional recombinant techniques<br>
such as described in Maniatis et al., Molecular Cloning - A Laboratory Manual; Cold<br>
Spring Harbor, 1982-1989.<br>
In particular, the process may comprise the steps of :<br>
i) preparing a replicable or integrating expression vector capable, in a host<br>
cell, of expressing a DNA polymer comprising a nucleotide sequence that encodes the<br>
protein or an immunogenic derivative thereof<br>
ii) transforming a host cell with said vector<br>
iii) culturing said transformed host cell under conditions permitting expression<br>
of said DNA polymer to produce said protein; and<br>
iv) recovering said protein<br>
The term "transforming" is used herein to mean the introduction of foreign DNA into a host<br>
cell. This can be achieved for example by transformation, transfection or infection with an<br>
appropriate plasmid or viral vector using e.g. conventional techniques as described in<br>
Genetic Engineering; Eds. S.M. Kingsman and A.J. Kingsman; Blackweil Scientific<br>
Publications; Oxford, England, 1988. The term transformed" or "transformant" will<br>
hereafter apply to the resulting host cell containing and expressing the foreign gene of<br>
interest.<br>
The expression vectors are novel and also form part of the invention.<br>
The replicable expression vectors may be prepared in accordance with the invention, by<br>
cleaving a vector compatible with the host cell to provide a linear DNA segment having an<br>
intact replicon, and combining said linear segment with one or more DNA molecules which,<br>
together with said linear segment encode the desired product, such as the DNA polymer<br>
encoding the protein of the invention, or derivative thereof, under ligating conditions.<br>
Thus, the DNA polymer may be performed or formed during the construction of the vector,<br>
as desired.<br>
The choice of vector will be determined in part by the host cell, which may be prokaryotic<br>
or eukaryotic but are preferably E. coli, yeast or CHO cells. Suitable vectors include<br>
plasmids, bacteriophages, cosmids and recombinant viruses. Expression and cloning<br>
vectors preferably contain a selectable marker such that only the host cells expressing the<br>
marker will survive under selective conditions. Selection genes include but are not limited<br>
to the one encoding protein that confer a resistance to ampicillin, tetracyclin or kanamycin.<br>
Expression vectors also contain control sequences which are compatible with the<br>
designated host. For example, expression control sequences for E. coli, and more<br>
generally for prokaryotes, include promoters and ribosome binding sites. Promoter<br>
sequences may be naturally occurring, such as the ß-lactamase (penicillinase) (Weissman<br>
1981, In Interferon 3 (ed. L. Gresser), lactose (lac) (Chang et al. Nature, 1977, 198: 1056)<br>
and tryptophan (trp) (Goeddel et al. Nucl. Acids Res. 1980, 8, 4057) and lambda-derived<br>
PL promoter system. In addition, synthetic promoters which do not occur in nature also<br>
function as bacterial promoters. This is the case for example for the tac synthetic hybrid<br>
promoter which is derived from sequences of the trp and lac promoters (De Boer et al.,<br>
Proc. Natl Acad Sci. USA 1983, 80, 21-26). These systems are particularly suitable with £<br>
coli.<br>
Yeast compatible vectors also carry markers that allow the selection of successful<br>
transformants by conferring prototrophy to auxotrophic mutants or resistance to heavy<br>
metals on wild-type strains. Expression control sequences for yeast vectors include<br>
promoters for glycolytic enzymes (Hess et al., J. Adv. Enzyme Reg. 1968, 7, 149), PHO5<br>
gene encoding acid phosphatase, CUP1 gene, ARG3 gene, GAL genes promoters and<br>
synthetic promoter sequences. Other control elements useful in yeast expression are<br>
terminators and mRNA leader sequences. The 5" coding sequence is particularly useful<br>
since it typically encodes a signal peptide comprised of hydrophobic amino acids which<br>
direct the secretion of the protein from the cell. Suitable signal sequences can be encoded<br>
by genes for secreted yeast proteins such as the yeast invertase gene and the a-factor<br>
gene, acid phosphatase, killer toxin, the alpha-mating factor gene and recently the<br>
heterologous inulinase signal sequence derived from INU1A gene of Kluyveromyces<br>
marxianus.. Suitable vectors have been developed for expression in Pichia pastoris and<br>
Saccharomyces cerevisiae.<br>
A variety of P. pastoris expression vectors are available based on various inducible or<br>
constitutive promoters (Cereghino and Cregg, FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2000,24:45-66). For<br>
the production of cytosolic and secreted proteins,the most commonly used P. pastoris<br>
vectors contain the very strong and tightly regulated alcohol oxidase (AOX1) promoter.<br>
The vectors also contain the P. pastoris histidinol dehydrogenase (HIS4) gene for selection<br>
in his4 hosts. Secretion of foreign protein require the presence of a signal sequence and<br>
the S. cerevisiae prepro alpha mating factor signal sequence has been widly and<br>
successfully used in Pichia expression system. Expression vectors are integrated into the<br>
P. pastoris genome to maximize the stability of expression strains. As in S.cerevisiae,<br>
cleavage of a P.pastoris expression vector within a sequence shared by the host genome<br>
(AOX1 or HIS4) stimulates homologous recombination events that efficiently target<br>
integration of the vector to that genomic locus. In general, a recombinant strain that<br>
contains multiple integrated copies of an expression cassette can yield more heterologous<br>
protein than single-copy strain. The most effective way to obtain high copy number<br>
transformants requires the transformation of Pichia recipient strain by the sphaeroplast<br>
technique (Cregg et all 1985, Mol.Cell.Biol. 5: 3376-3385) .<br>
The preparation of the repiicable expression vector may be carried out conventionally with<br>
appropriate enzymes for restriction, polymerisation and ligation of the DNA, by procedures<br>
described in, for example, Maniatis ef al. cited above.<br>
The recombinant host cell is prepared, in accordance with the invention, by transforming a<br>
host cell with a repiicable expression vector of the invention under transforming conditions.<br>
Suitable transforming conditions are conventional and are described in, for example,<br>
Maniatis et al, cited above, or "DNA Cloning" Vol. II, D.M. Glover ed., IRL Press Ltd, 1985.<br>
The choice of transforming conditions depends upon the choice of the host cell to be<br>
transformed. For example, in vivo transformation using a live viral vector as the<br>
transforming agent for the polynucleotides of the invention is described above. Bacterial<br>
transformation of a host such as E. coli may be done by direct uptake of the<br>
polynucleotides (which may be expression vectors containing the desired sequence) after<br>
the host has been treated with a solution of CaCI2 (Cohen et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sa".,<br>
1973, 69, 2110) or with a solution comprising a mixture of rubidium chloride (RbC1),<br>
MnCI2, potassium acetate and glycerol, and then with 3-[N-morpholino]-propane-sulphonic<br>
acid, RbC1 and glycerol or by electroporation. Transformation of lower eukaryotic<br>
organisms such as yeast cells in culture by direct uptake may be carried out for example<br>
by using the method of Hinnen et al (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1978, 75 : 1929-1933).<br>
Mammalian cells in culture may be transformed using the calcium phosphate co-<br>
precipitation of the vector DNA onto the cells (Graham &amp; Van der Eb, Virology 1978, 52,<br>
546). Other methods for introduction of polynucleotides into mammalian ceils include<br>
dextran mediated transfection, polybrene mediated transfection, protoplast fusion,<br>
electroporation, encapsulation of the polynucleotide(s) into liposomes, and direct microinjection<br>
of the polynucleotides into nuclei.<br>
The invention also extends to a host cell transformed with a nucleic acid encoding the<br>
protein of the invention or a repiicable expression vector of the invention.<br>
Cuituring the transformed host cell under conditions permitting expression of the DNA<br>
polymer is carried out conventionally, as described in, for example, Maniatis et al. and<br>
"DNA Cloning" cited above. Thus, preferably the cell is supplied with nutrient and cultured<br>
at a temperature below 50ºC, preferably between 25°C and 42°C, more preferably<br>
between 25ºC and 35ºC, most preferably at 30°C. The incubation time may vary from a<br>
few minutes to a few hours, according to the proportion of the polypeptide in the bacterial<br>
cell, as assessed by SDS-PAGE or Western blot.<br>
The product may be recovered by conventional methods according to the host cell and<br>
according to the localisation of the expression product (intracellular or secreted into the<br>
culture medium or into the cell periplasm). Thus, where the host ceil is bacterial, such as<br>
E. coli it may, for example, be lysed physically, chemically or enzymatically and the protein<br>
product isolated from the resulting lysate. Where the host cell is mammalian, the product<br>
may generally be isolated from the nutrient medium or from cell free extracts. Where the<br>
host cell is a yeast such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae or Pichia pastoris, the product may<br>
generally be isolated from from lysed cells or from the culture medium, and then further<br>
purified using conventional techniques. The specificity of the expression system may be<br>
assessed by western blot or by ELISA using an antibody directed against the polypeptide<br>
of interest.<br>
Conventional protein isolation techniques include selective precipitation, adsorption<br>
chromatography, and affinity chromatography including a monoclonal antibody affinity<br>
column. When the proteins of the present invention are expressed with a histidine tail (His<br>
tag), they can easily be purified by affinity chromatography using an ion metal affinity<br>
chromatography column (IMAC) column.The metal ion, may be any suitable ion for<br>
example zinc, nickel, iron, magnesium or copper, but is preferably zinc or nickel.<br>
Preferably the IMAC buffer contains detergent, preferably an anionic detergent such as<br>
SDS, more preferably a non-ionic detergent such as Tween 80, or a zwitterionic detergent<br>
such as Empigen BB, as this may result in lower levels of endotoxin in the final product.<br>
Further chromatographic steps include for example a Q-Sepharose step that may be<br>
operated either before of after the IMAC column. Preferably the pH is in the range of 7.5 to<br>
10, more preferably from 7.5 to 9.5, optimally between 8 and 9.<br>
The proteins of the invention can thus be purified according to the following protocol. After<br>
cell disruption, cell extracts containing the protein can be solubilised in a pH 8.5 Tris buffer<br>
containing urea (8.0 M for example), and SDS (from 0.5% to 1% for example). After<br>
centrifugation, the resulting supernatant may then be loaded onto on to an IMAC (Nickel)<br>
Sepharose FF column equilibrated with a pH 8.5 Tris buffer. The column may then be<br>
washed with a high salt containing buffer (eg 0.75 - 1.5m NaC1, 15 mM pH 8.5 Tris<br>
buffer). The column may optionally then be washed again with phosphate buffer without<br>
salt. The proteins of the invention may be eluated from the column with an imidazole-<br>
containing buffered solution. The proteins can then be submitted to an additional<br>
chromatographic step, such as to an anion exchange chromatography (Q Sepharose for<br>
example).<br>
The proteins of the present invention are provided either soluble in a liquid form or in a<br>
lyophilised form, which is the preferred form. It is generally expected that each human<br>
dose will comprise 1 to 1000 µg of protein, and preferably 30-300 µg. The purification<br>
process can also include a carboxyamidation step whereby the protein is first reduced in<br>
the presence of Glutathion and then carboxymethylated in the presence of iodoacetamide.<br>
This step offers the advantage of controling the oxidative aggregation of the molecule with<br>
itself or with host cell protein contaminants through covalent bridging with disulphide<br>
bonds.<br>
The present invention also provides pharmaceutical and immunogenic compositions<br>
comprising a protein of the present invention in a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient.<br>
A preferred vaccine composition comprises at least a protein according to the invention.<br>
Said protein has, preferably, blocked thiol groups and is highly purified, e.g. has less than<br>
5% host cell contamination. Such vaccine may optionally contain one or more other<br>
tumour-associated antigen and derivatives. For example, suitable other associated antigen<br>
include prostase, PAP-1, PSA (prostate specific antigen), PSMA (prostate-specific<br>
membrane antigen), PSCA (Prostate Stem Cell Antigen), STEAP.<br>
In another embodiment, illustrative immunogenic compositions, such as for example<br>
vaccine compositions, of the present invention comprise DNA encoding one or more of the<br>
fusion polypeptides as described above, such that the fusion polypeptide is generated in<br>
situ. As noted above, the polynucleotide may be administered within any of a variety of<br>
delivery systems known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Indeed, numerous gene<br>
delivery techniques are well known in the art, such as those described by Rolland, Crit.<br>
Rev. Therap. Drug Carrier Systems 75:143-198, 1998, and references cited therein.<br>
Appropriate polynucleotide expression systems will, of course, contain the necessary<br>
regulatory DNA regulatory sequences for expression in a patient (such as a suitable<br>
promoter and terminating signal). Alternatively, bacterial delivery systems may involve the<br>
administration of a bacterium (such as Bacillus-Calmette-Guerrin) that expresses an<br>
immunogenic portion of the polypeptide on its cell surface or secretes such an epitope.<br>
Therefore, in certain embodiments, polynucleotides encoding immunogenic polypeptides<br>
described herein are introduced into suitable mammalian host cells for expression using<br>
any of a number of known viral-based systems. In one illustrative embodiment,<br>
retroviruses provide a convenient and effective platform for gene delivery systems. A<br>
selected nucleotide sequence encoding a polypeptide of the present invention can be<br>
inserted into a vector and packaged in retroviral particles using techniques known in the<br>
art. The recombinant virus can then be isolated and delivered to a subject. A number of<br>
illustrative retroviral systems have been described (e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,219,740; Miller<br>
and Rosman (1989) BioTechniques 7:980-990; Miller, A. D. (1990) Human Gene Therapy<br>
1:5-14; Scarpa et al. (1991) Virology 180:849-852; Burns et al. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad.<br>
Sci. USA 90:8033-8037; and Boris-Lawrie and Temin (1993) Cur. Opin. Genet. Develop.<br>
3:102-109.<br>
In addition, a number of illustrative adenovirus-based systems have also been described.<br>
Unlike retroviruses which integrate into the host genome, adenoviruses persist<br>
extrachromosomally thus minimizing the risks associated with insertional mutagenesis<br>
(Haj-Ahmad and Graham (1986) J. Virol. 57:267-274; Bett et al. (1993) J. Virol. 67:5911-<br>
5921; Mittereder et al. (1994) Human Gene Therapy 5:717-729; Seth et al. (1994) J. Virol.<br>
68:933-940; Barr et al. (1994) Gene Therapy 1:51-58; Berkner, K. L (1988) BioTechniques<br>
6:616-629; and Rich et al. (1993) Human Gene Therapy 4:461-476). Since humans are<br>
sometimes infected by common human adenovirus serotypes such as AdHu5, a significant<br>
proportion of the population have a neutralizing antibody response to the adenovirus,<br>
which is likley to effect the immune response to a heterologous antigen in a recombinant<br>
vaccine based system. Non-human primate adenoviral vectors such as the chimpanzee<br>
adenovirus 68 (AdC68, Fitzgerald et al. (2003) J. Immunol 170(3):1416-22)) are may offer<br>
an alternative adenoviral system without the disadvantage of a pre-existing neutralising<br>
antibody response.<br>
Various adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector systems have also been developed for<br>
polynucleotide delivery. AAV vectors can be readily constructed using techniques well<br>
known in the art. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,173,414 and 5,139,941; International<br>
Publication Nos. WO 92/01070 and WO 93/03769; Lebkowski et al. (1988) Molec. Cell.<br>
Biol. 8:3988-3996; Vincent et al. (1990) Vaccines 90 (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory<br>
Press); Carter, B. J. (1992) Current Opinion in Biotechnology 3:533-539; Muzyczka, N.<br>
(1992) Current Topics in Microbiol, and Immunol. 158:97-129; Kotin, R. M. (1994) Human<br>
Gene Therapy 5:793-801; Shelling and Smith (1994) Gene Therapy 1:165-169; and Zhou<br>
et al. (1994) J. Exp. Med. 179:1867-1875.<br>
Additional viral vectors useful for delivering the nucleic acid molecules encoding<br>
polypeptides of the present invention by gene transfer include those derived from the pox<br>
family of viruses, such as vaccinia virus and avian poxvirus. By way of example, vaccinia<br>
virus recombinants expressing the novel molecules can be constructed as follows. The<br>
DNA encoding a polypeptide is first inserted into an appropriate vector so that it is adjacent<br>
to a vaccinia promoter and flanking vaccinia DNA sequences, such as the sequence<br>
encoding thymidine kinase (TK). This vector is then used to transfect cells which are<br>
simultaneously infected with vaccinia. Homologous recombination serves to insert the<br>
vaccinia promoter plus the gene encoding the polypeptide of interest into the viral genome.<br>
The resulting TK.sup.(-) recombinant can be selected by culturing the cells in the presence<br>
of 5-bromodeoxyuridine and picking viral plaques resistant thereto.<br>
A vaccinia-based infection/transfection system can be conveniently used to provide for<br>
inducible, transient expression or coexpression of one or more polypeptides described<br>
herein in host cells of an organism. In this particular system, cells are first infected in vitro<br>
with a vaccinia virus recombinant that encodes the bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase.<br>
This polymerase displays exquisite specificity in that it only transcribes templates bearing<br>
T7 promoters. Following infection, cells are transfected with the polynucleotide or<br>
polynucleotides of interest, driven by a T7 promoter. The polymerase expressed in the<br>
cytoplasm from the vaccinia virus recombinant transcribes the transfected DNA into RNA<br>
which is then translated into polypeptide by the host translational machinery. The method<br>
provides for high level, transient, cytoplasmic production of large quantities of RNA and its<br>
translation products. See, e.g., Elroy-Stein and Moss, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA (1990)<br>
87:6743-6747; Fuerst et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA (1986) 83:8122-8126.<br>
Alternatively, avipoxviruses, such as the fowlpox and canarypox viruses, can also be used<br>
to deliver the coding sequences of interest. Recombinant avipox viruses, expressing<br>
immunogens from mammalian pathogens, are known to confer protective immunity when<br>
administered to non-avian species. The use of an Avipox vector is particularly desirable in<br>
human and other mammalian species since members of the Avipox genus can only<br>
productively replicate in susceptible avian species and therefore are not infective in<br>
mammalian cells. Methods for producing recombinant Avipoxviruses are known in the art<br>
and employ genetic recombination, as described above with respect to the production of<br>
vaccinia viruses. See, e.g., WO 91/12882; WO 89/03429; and WO 92/03545.<br>
Any of a number of alphavirus vectors can also be used for delivery of polynucleotide<br>
compositions of the present invention, such as those vectors described in U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
5,843,723; 6,015,686; 6,008,035 and 6,015,694. Certain vectors based on Venezuelan<br>
Equine Encephalitis (VEE) can also be used, illustrative examples of which can be found in<br>
U.S. Patent Nos. 5,505,947 and 5,643.576.<br>
The compositions of the present invention can be delivered by a number of routes such as<br>
intramuscularly, subcutaneously, intraperitonally or intravenously.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, a polynucleotide is administered/delivered as<br>
"naked" DNA, for example as described in Ulmer et al., Science 259:1745-1749,1993 and<br>
reviewed by Cohen, Science 259:1691-1692, 1993. The uptake of naked DNA may be<br>
increased by coating the DNA onto biodegradable beads, which are efficiently transported<br>
into the cells. In a preferred embodiment, the composition is delivered intradermally. In<br>
particular, the composition is delivered by means of a gene gun (particularly particle<br>
bombardment) administration techniques which involve coating the vector on to a bead (eg<br>
gold) which are then administered under high pressure into the epidermis; such as, for<br>
example, as described in Haynes et al, J Biotechnology 44: 37-42 (1996).<br>
In one illustrative example, gas-driven particle acceleration can be achieved with devices<br>
such as those manufactured by Powderject Pharmaceuticals PLC (Oxford, UK) and<br>
Powderject Vaccines Inc. (Madison, Wl), some examples of which are described in U.S.<br>
Patent Nos. 5,846,796; 6,010,478; 5,865,796; 5,584,807; and EP Patent No. 0500 799.<br>
This approach offers a needle-free delivery approach wherein a dry powder formulation of<br>
microscopic particles, such as polynucleotide, are accelerated to high speed within a<br>
helium gas jet generated by a hand held device, propelling the particles into a target tissue<br>
of interest, typically the skin. The particles are preferably gold beads of a 0.4 - 4.0 µm,<br>
more preferably 0.6 - 2.0 µm diameter and the DNA conjugate coated onto these and<br>
then encased in a cartridge or cassette for placing into the "gene gun".<br>
In a related embodiment, other devices and methods that may be useful for gas-driven<br>
needle-less injection of compositions of the present invention include those provided by<br>
Bioject, Inc. (Portland, OR), some examples of which are described in U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
4,790,824; 5,064,413; 5,312,335; 5,383,851; 5,399,163; 5,520,639 and 5,993,412.<br>
It is possible for the immunogen component comprising the nucleotide sequence encoding<br>
the antigenic peptide, to be administered on a once off basis or to be administered<br>
repeatedly, for example, between 1 and 7 times, preferably between 1 and 4 times, at<br>
intervals between about 1 day and about 18 months. However, this treatment regime will<br>
be significantly varied depending upon the size of the patient, the disease which is being<br>
treated/protected against, the amount of nucleotide sequence administered, the route of<br>
administration, and other factors which would be apparent to a skilled medical<br>
practitioner.<br>
It is therefore another aspect of the present invention to provide for the use of a protein or<br>
a DNA encoding said protein, as described herein, in the manufacture of an immunogenic<br>
composition for eliciting an immune response in a patient. Preferably the immune response<br>
is to be elicited by sequential administration of i) the said protein followed by the said DNA<br>
sequence; or ii) the said DNA sequence followed by the said protein. More preferably the<br>
ONA sequence is coated onto biodegradable beads or delivered via a particle<br>
bombardment approach. Still more preferably the protein ios adjuvanted, preferably with a<br>
TH-1 inducing adjuvant, preferably with a CpG/QS21 based adjuvant formulation.<br>
The vectors which comprise the nucleotide sequences encoding antigenic peptides are<br>
administered in such amount as will be prophylactically or therapeutically effective. The<br>
quantity to be administered, is generally in the range of one picogram to 16 milligram,<br>
preferably 1 picogram to 10 micrograms for particle-mediated delivery, and 10 micrograms<br>
to 16 milligram for other routes of nucleotide per dose. The exact quantity may vary<br>
considerably depending on the weight of the patient being immunised and the route of<br>
administration.<br>
Suitable techniques for introducing the naked polynucleotide or vector into a patient also<br>
include topical application with an appropriate vehicle. The nucleic acid may be<br>
administered topically to the skin, or to mucosal surfaces for example by intranasal, oral,<br>
intravaginal or intrarectal administration. The naked polynucleotide or vector may be<br>
present together with a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, such as phosphate buffered<br>
saline (PBS). DNA uptake may be further facilitated by use of facilitating agents such as<br>
bupivacaine, either separately or included in the DNA formulation. Other methods of<br>
administering the nucleic acid directly to a recipient include ultrasound, electrical<br>
stimulation, electroporation and microseeding which is described in US 5,697,901.<br>
Uptake of nucleic acid constructs may be enhanced by several known transfection<br>
techniques, for example those including the use of transfection agents. Examples of these<br>
agents includes cationic agents, for example, calcium phosphate and DEAE-Dextran and<br>
lipofectants, for example, lipofectam and transfectam. The dosage of the nucleic acid to<br>
be administered can be altered.<br>
The fusion proteins and encoding polypeptides according to the invention can also be<br>
formulated as a phamaceutical/immunogenic composition, e.g. as a vaccine. Accordingly<br>
therefore, the present invention also provides for a pharmaceutical/immunogenic<br>
composition comprising a fusion protein of the present invention in a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable excipient. Accordingly there is also provided a process for the preparation of an<br>
immunogenic composition according to the present invention, comprising admixing the<br>
fusion protein of the invention or the encoding polynucleotide with a suitable adjuvant,<br>
diluent or other pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
The fusion proteins of the present invention are provided preferably at least 80% pure<br>
more preferably 90% pure as visualised by SDS PAGE. Preferably the proteins appear as<br>
a single band by SDS PAGE.<br>
Vaccine preparation is generally described in Vaccine Design ("The subunit and adjuvant<br>
approach" (eds. Powell M.F. &amp; Newman M.J). (1995) Plenum Press New York).<br>
Encapsulation within liposomes is described by Fullerton, US Patent 4,235,877.<br>
The fusion proteins of the present invention and encoding polynucleotides are preferably<br>
adjuvanted in the vaccine formulation of the invention. Certain adjuvants are commercially<br>
available as, for example, Freund"s Incomplete Adjuvant and Complete Adjuvant (Difco<br>
Laboratories, Detroit, Ml); Merck Adjuvant 65 (Merck and Company, Inc., Rahway, NJ);<br>
AS-2 (SmithKline Beecham, Philadelphia, PA); aluminum salts such as aluminum<br>
hydroxide gel (alum) or aluminum phosphate; salts of calcium, iron or zinc; an insoluble<br>
suspension of acylated tyrosine; acylated sugars; cationically or anionically derivatised<br>
polysaccharides; polyphosphazenes; biodegradable microspheres; monophosphoryl lipid A<br>
and quil A. Cytokines, such as GM-CSF, interleukin-2, -7, -12, and other like growth<br>
factors, may also be used as adjuvants.<br>
Within certain embodiments of the invention, the adjuvant composition is preferably one<br>
that induces an immune response predominantly of the Th1 type. High levels of Th1-type<br>
cytokines (e.g., IFN-?, TNFa, IL-2 and IL-12) tend to favor the induction of cell mediated<br>
immune responses to an administered antigen. In contrast, high levels of Th2-type<br>
cytokines (e.g., IL-4, IL-5, IL-6 and IL-10) tend to favor the induction of humoral immune<br>
responses. Following application of a vaccine as provided herein, a patient will support an<br>
immune response that includes Th1- and Th2-type responses. Within a preferred<br>
embodiment, in which a response is predominantly Th1-type, the level of Th1-type<br>
cytokines will increase to a greater extent than the level of Th2-type cytokines. The levels<br>
of these cytokines may be readily assessed using standard assays. For a review of the<br>
families of cytokines, see Mosmann and Coffman, Ann. Rev. Immunol. 7:145-173, 1989.<br>
Preferred TH-1 inducing adjuvants are selected from the group of adjuvants comprising:<br>
3D-MPL, QS21, a mixture of QS21 and cholesterol, and a CpG oligonucleotide or a<br>
mixture of two or more said adjuvants. Certain preferred adjuvants for eliciting a<br>
predominantly Th1-type response include, for example, a combination of monophosphoryl<br>
lipid A, preferably 3-de-O-acylated monophosphoryl lipid A, together with an aluminum<br>
salt. MPL® adjuvants are available from Corixa Corporation (Seattle, WA; see, for<br>
example, US Patent Nos. 4,436,727; 4,877,611; 4,866,034 and 4,912,094). CpG-<br>
containing oligonucleotides (in which the CpG dinucleotide is unmethylated) also induce a<br>
predominantly Th1 response. Such oligonucleotides are well known and are described, for<br>
example, in WO 96/02555, WO 99/33488 and U.S. Patent Nos. 6,008,200 and 5.856,462.<br>
Immunostimulatory DNA sequences are also described, for example, by Sato et a!.,<br>
Science 273:352,1996. Another preferred adjuvant comprises a saponin, such as Quil A,<br>
or derivatives thereof, including QS21 and QS7 (Aquila Biopharmaceuticals Inc.,<br>
Framingham, MA); Escin; Digitonin; or Gypsophila or Chenopodium quinoa saponins .<br>
Other preferred formulations include more than one saponin in the adjuvant combinations<br>
of the present invention, for example combinations of at least two of the following group<br>
comprising QS21, QS7, Quil A, ß-escin, or digitonin.<br>
Alternatively the saponin formulations may be combined with vaccine vehicles composed<br>
of chitosan or other polycationic polymers, polylactide and polylactide-co-glycolide<br>
particles, poly-N-acetyl glucosamine-based polymer matrix, particles composed of<br>
polysaccharides or chemically modified polysaccharides, liposomes and lipid-based<br>
particles, particles composed of glycerol monoesters, etc. The saponins may also be<br>
formulated in the presence of cholesterol to form particulate structures such as liposomes<br>
or ISCOMs. Furthermore, the saponins may be formulated together with a polyoxyethylene<br>
ether or ester, in either a non-particulate solution or suspension, or in a particulate<br>
structure such as a paucilamelar liposome or ISCOM. The saponins may also be<br>
formulated with excipients such as CarbopolR to increase viscosity, or may be formulated<br>
in a dry powder form with a powder excipient such as lactose.<br>
In one preferred embodiment, the adjuvant system includes the combination of a<br>
monophosphoryl lipid A and a saponin derivative, such as the combination of QS21 and<br>
3D-MPL® adjuvant, as described in WO 94/00153, or a less reactogenic composition<br>
where the QS21 is quenched with cholesterol, as described in WO 96/33739. Other<br>
preferred formulations comprise an oil-in-water emulsion and tocopherol. Another<br>
particularly preferred adjuvant formulation employing QS21, 3D-MPL® adjuvant and<br>
tocopherol in an oil-in-water emulsion is described in WO 95/17210.<br>
Another enhanced adjuvant system involves the combination of a CpG-containing<br>
oligonucleotide and a saponin derivative particularly the combination of CpG and QS21 as<br>
disclosed in WO 00/09159 and in WO 00/62800. Preferably the formulation additionally<br>
comprises an oil in water emulsion and tocopherol.<br>
In a yet further embodiment the present invention provides an immunogenic composition<br>
comprising a fusion protein according to the invention, and further comprising D3-MPL, a<br>
saponin preferably QS21 and a CpG oligonucleotide, optionally formulated in an oil in<br>
water emulsion.<br>
Additional illustrative adjuvants for use in the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention<br>
include Montanide ISA 720 (Seppic, France), SAF (Chiron, California, United States),<br>
ISCOMS (CSL), MF-59 (Chiron), the SBAS series of adjuvants (e.g., SBAS-2 or SBAS-4,<br>
available from SmithKline Beecham, Rixensart, Belgium), Detox (Enhanzyn®) (Corixa,<br>
Hamilton, MT), RC-529 (Corixa, Hamilton, MT) and other aminoalkyl glucosaminide 4-<br>
phosphates (AGPs), such as those described in pending U.S. Patent Application Serial<br>
Nos. 08/853,826 and 09/074,720, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by<br>
reference in their entireties, and polyoxyethylene ether adjuvants such as those described<br>
in WO99/52549A1.<br>
Other preferred adjuvants include adjuvant molecules of the general formula (I):<br>
HO(CH2CH2O)n-A-R, wherein, n is 1-50, A is a bond or-C(O)-, R is C1-50 alkyl or Phenyl<br>
C1-50 alkyl. One embodiment of the present invention consists of a vaccine formulation<br>
comprising a polyoxyethylene ether of general formula (I), wherein n is between 1 and 50,<br>
preferably 4-24, most preferably 9; the R component is C1-50, preferably C4-C20 alkyl and<br>
most preferably C12 alkyl, and A is a bond. The concentration of the polyoxyethylene<br>
ethers should be in the range 0.1-20%, preferably from 0.1-10%, and most preferably in<br>
the range 0.1-1%. Preferred polyoxyethylene ethers are selected from the following group:<br>
polyoxyethylene-9-lauryl ether, polyoxyethylene-9-steoryl ether, polyoxyethylene-8-steoryl<br>
ether, polyoxyethylene-4-lauryl ether, polyoxyethylene-35-lauryl ether, and<br>
polyoxyethylene-23-lauryl ether. Polyoxyethylene ethers such as polyoxyethylene lauryl<br>
ether are described in the Merck index (12th edition: entry 7717). These adjuvant<br>
molecules are described in WO 99/52549. The polyoxyethylene ether according to the<br>
general formula (I) above may, if desired, be combined with another adjuvant. For<br>
example, a preferred adjuvant combination is preferably with CpG as described in the<br>
pending UK patent application GB 9820956.2.<br>
It is an embodiment of the invention that the antigens, including nucleic acid vector, of the<br>
invention be utilised with immunostimulatory agent. Preferably the immunostimulatory<br>
agent is administered at the same time as the antigens of the invention and in preferred<br>
embodiments are formulated together. It is another embodiment of the invention that the<br>
antigen and immunostimulatory agent (or vice versa) are administered sequentially to the<br>
same or adjacent sites, separated in time by periods of between 0-100 hours. Such<br>
immunostimulatory agents include but are not limited to: synthetic imidazoquinolines such<br>
as imiquimod [S-26308, R-837], (Harrison, et al., Vaccine 19: 1820-1826, 2001; and<br>
resiquimod [S-28463, R-848] (Vasilakos, et al.. Cellular immunology 204: 64-74, 2000.;<br>
Schiff bases of carbonyls and amines that are constitutively expressed on antigen<br>
presenting cell and T-cell surfaces, such as tucaresol (Rhodes, J. et al., Nature 377: 71-<br>
75, 1995), cytokine, chemokine and co-stimulatory molecules as either protein or peptide,<br>
including for example pro-inflammatory cytokines such as Interferon, GM-CSF, IL-1 alpha,<br>
IL-1 beta, TGF- alpha and TGF - beta, Th1 inducers such as interferon gamma, IL-2, IL-<br>
12, IL-15, IL-18 and IL-21, Th2 inducers such as IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10 and IL-13 and other<br>
chemokine and co-stimulatory genes such as MCP-1, MIP-1 alpha, MIP-1 beta, RANTES,<br>
TCA-3, CD80, CD86 and CD40L, other immunostimulatory targeting ligands such as<br>
CTLA-4 and L-selectin, apoptosis stimulating proteins and peptides such as Fas, (49),<br>
synthetic lipid based adjuvants, such as vaxfectin, (Reyes et al., Vaccine 19: 3778-3786,<br>
2001) squalene, alpha- tocopherol, polysorbate 80, DOPC and cholesterol, endotoxin,<br>
[LPS], (Beutler, B., Current Opinion in Microbiology 3: 23-30, 2000); CpG oligo- and di-<br>
nucleotides (Sato, Y. et al., Science 273 (5273): 352-354, 1996; Hemmi, H. et al., Nature<br>
408: 740-745, 2000) and other potential ligands that trigger Toll receptors to produce Th1-<br>
inducing cytokines, such as synthetic Mycobacterial lipoproteins, Mycobacterial protein<br>
p19, peptidoglycan, teichoic acid and lipid A.<br>
Other suitable adjuvant include CT (cholera toxin, subunites A and B) and LT (heat labile<br>
enterotoxin from E. coli, subunites A and B), heat shock protein family (HSPs), and LLO<br>
(listeriolysin O; WO 01/72329).<br>
Where the immunostimulatory agent is a protein, the agent may be administered either as<br>
a protein or as a polynucleotide encoding the protein.<br>
Other suitable delivery systems include microspheres wherein the antigenic material is<br>
ncorporated into or conjugated to biodegradable polymers/microspheres sothat the<br>
antigenic material can be mixed with a suitable pharmaceutical carrier and used as a<br>
vaccine. The term "microspheres" is generally employed to describe colloidal particles<br>
which are substantially spherical and have a diameter in the range 10 nm to 2 mm.<br>
Microspheres made from a very wide range of natural and synthetic polymers have found<br>
use in a variety of biomedical applications. This delivery system is especially<br>
advantageous for proteins having short half-lives in vivo requiring multiple treatments to<br>
provide efficacy, or being unstable in biological fluids or not fully absorbed from the<br>
gastrointestinal tract because of their relatively high molecular weights. Several polymers<br>
have been described as a matrix for protein release. Suitable polymers include gelatin,<br>
collagen, alginates, dextran. Preferred delivery systems include biodegradable poly(DL-<br>
lactic acid) (PLA), poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLG), polyfglycolic acid) (PGA), poly(e-<br>
caprolactone) (PCL), and copolymers poly(DL-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA). Other<br>
preferred systems include heterogeneous hydrogels such as poly(ether ester) multiblock<br>
copolymers, containing repeating blocks based on hydrophilic poly-(ethylene glycol) (PEG)<br>
and hydrophobic poly(butylene terephtalate) (PBT), or poly(ehtykene glycol)-<br>
terephtalate/poly(-butylene terephtalate) (PEGT/PBT) (Sohier et al. Eur. J. Pharm and<br>
Biopharm, 2003, 55, 221-228). Systems are preferred which provide a sustained release<br>
for 1 to 3 months such as PLGA, PLA and PEGT/PBT.<br>
It is possible for the immunogenic or vaccine composition to be administered on a once off<br>
basis or, preferably, to be administered repeatedly, as many times as necessary, for<br>
example, between 1 and 7 times, preferably between 1 and 4 times, at intervals between<br>
about 1 day and about 18 months, preferably one month. This may be optionally followed<br>
by dosing at regular intervals of between 1 and 12 months for a period up to the remainder<br>
of the patient"s life. In a preferred embodiment the patient receives the antigen in different<br>
forms in a "prime boost" regime. Thus for example the antigen, the fusion protein, is first<br>
administered as a protein adjuvant base formulation and then subsequently administered<br>
as a DMA based vaccine. This administration mode is preferred. The preferred adjuvant is<br>
a combination of a CpG-containing oligonucleotide and a saponin derivative, particularly<br>
the combination of CpG and QS21 as disclosed in WO 00/09159 and in WO 00/62800.<br>
The uptake of naked DNA may be increased by coating the DNA onto biodegradable<br>
beads, which are efficiently transported into the cells. Alternatively the DNA can be<br>
delivered via a particle bombardment approach, for example, gas-driven particle<br>
acceleration with devices such as those manufactured by Powderject Pharmaceuticals<br>
PLC (Oxford, UK) and Powderject Vaccines Inc. (Madison, Wl) as taught herein. This<br>
approach offers a needle-free delivery approach wherein a dry powder formulation of<br>
microscopic particles, such as polynucleotide or polypeptide particles, are accelerated to<br>
high speed within a helium gas jet generated by a hand held device, propelling the<br>
particles into a target tissue of interest.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the DNA based vaccine will be administered first,<br>
followed by the protein adjuvant base formulation. Still another embodiment will concern<br>
the delivery of the DNA construct by means of specialised delivery vectors, preferably by<br>
the means of viral system, most preferably by the means of adenoviral-based systems.<br>
Other suitable viral-based systems of DNA delivery include retroviral, lentiviral, adeno-<br>
associated viral, herpes viral and vaccinia-viral based systems.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the protein adjuvant base formulation and DNA based<br>
vaccine may be co-administered at adjacent or overlapping sites. Dependent upon the<br>
nature of the DNA vaccine formulation, this can be achieved by mixing the DNA and<br>
protein adjuvant formulations prior to administration or by simultaneously administration of<br>
the DNA and protein adjuvant formulation.<br>
The treatment regime will be significantly varied depending upon the size and species of<br>
patient concerned, the amount of nucleic acid vaccine and / or protein composition<br>
administered, the route of administration, the potency and dose of any adjuvant<br>
compounds used and other factors which would be apparent to a skilled medical<br>
practitioner.<br>
Within further aspects, the present invention provides methods for stimulating an immune<br>
response in a patient, preferably a T cell response in a human patient, comprising<br>
administering a pharmaceutical composition described herein. The patient may be<br>
afflicted with lung or colon cancer or colorectal cancer or breast cancer, in which case the<br>
methods provide treatment for the disease, or patient considered at risk for such a disease<br>
may be treated prophylactically.<br>
Within further aspects, the present invention provides methods for inhibiting the<br>
development of a cancer in a patient, comprising administering to a patient a<br>
pharmaceutical composition as recited above. The patient may be afflicted with, for<br>
example, sarcoma, prostate, ovarian, bladder, lung, colon, colorectal or breast cancer, in<br>
which case the methods provide treatment for the disease, or patient considered at risk for<br>
such a disease may be treated prophylactically.<br>
The present invention further provides, within other aspects, methods for removing tumour<br>
cells from a biological sample, comprising contacting a biological sample with T cells that<br>
specifically react with a polypeptide of the present invention, wherein the step of contacting<br>
is performed under conditions and for a time sufficient to permit the removal of cells<br>
expressing the protein from the sample.<br>
Within related aspects, methods are provided for inhibiting the development of a cancer in<br>
a patient, comprising administering to a patient a biological sample treated as described<br>
above.<br>
Methods are further provided, within other aspects, for stimulating and/or expanding T cells<br>
specific for a polypeptide of the present invention, comprising contacting T cells with one<br>
or more of: (i) a polypeptide as described above; (ii) a polynucleotide encoding such a<br>
polypeptide; and/or (iii) an antigen presenting cell that expresses such a polypeptide;<br>
under conditions and for a time sufficient to permit the stimulation and/or expansion of T<br>
cells. Isolated T cell populations comprising T cells prepared as described above are also<br>
provided.<br>
Within further aspects, the present invention provides methods for inhibiting the<br>
development of a cancer in a patient, comprising administering to a patient an effective<br>
amount of a T cell population as described above.<br>
The present invention further provides methods for inhibiting the development of a cancer<br>
in a patient, comprising the steps of: (a) incubating CD4+ and/or CD8+ T cells isolated<br>
from a patient with one or more of: (i) a polypeptide disclosed herein; (ii) a polynucleotide<br>
encoding such a polypeptide; and (iii) an antigen-presenting cell that expressed such a<br>
polypeptide; and (b) administering to the patient an effective amount of the proliferated T<br>
cells, and thereby inhibiting the development of a cancer in the patient. Proliferated cells<br>
may, but need not, be cloned prior to administration to the patient.<br>
According to another embodiment of this invention, an immunogenic composition<br>
described herein is delivered to a host via antigen presenting cells (APCs), such as<br>
dendritic cells, macrophages, B cells, monocytes and other cells that may be engineered<br>
to be efficient APCs. Such cells may, but need not, be genetically modified to increase the<br>
capacity for presenting the antigen, to improve activation and/or maintenance of the T cell<br>
response, to have anti-tumor effects per se and/or to be immunologically compatible with<br>
the receiver (i.e., matched HLA haplotype). APCs may generally be isolated from any of a<br>
variety of biological fluids and organs, including tumor and peritumoral tissues, and may be<br>
autologous, allogeneic, syngeneic or xenogeneic cells.<br>
Certain preferred embodiments of the present invention use dendritic cells or progenitors<br>
thereof as antigen-presenting cells. Dendritic cells are highly potent APCs (Banchereau<br>
and Steinman, Nature 392:245-251, 1998) and have been shown to be effective as a<br>
physiological adjuvant for eliciting prophylactic or therapeutic antitumor immunity (see<br>
Timmerman and Levy, Ann. Rev. Med. 50:507-529, 1999). In general, dendritic cells may<br>
be identified based on their typical shape (stellate in situ, with marked cytoplasmic<br>
processes (dendrites) visible in vitro), their ability to take up, process and present antigens<br>
with high efficiency and their ability to activate naive T cell responses. Dendritic cells may,<br>
of course, be engineered to express specific cell-surface receptors or ligands that are not<br>
commonly found on dendritic cells in vivo or ex vivo, and such modified dendritic cells are<br>
contemplated by the present invention. As an alternative to dendritic cells, secreted<br>
vesicles antigen-loaded dendritic cells (called exosomes) may be used within a vaccine<br>
(see Zitvogel et al., Nature Med. 4:594-600,1998).<br>
Dendritic cells and progenitors may be obtained from peripheral blood, bone marrow,<br>
tumor-infiltrating cells, peritumoral tissues-infiltrating cells, lymph nodes, spleen, skin,<br>
umbilical cord blood or any other suitable tissue or fluid. For example, dendritic cells may<br>
be differentiated ex vivo by adding a combination of cytokines such as GM-CSF, IL-4, IL-<br>
13 and/or TNFa to cultures of monocytes harvested from peripheral blood. Alternatively,<br>
CD34 positive cells harvested from peripheral blood, umbilical cord blood or bone marrow<br>
may be differentiated into dendritic cells by adding to the culture medium combinations of<br>
GM-CSF, IL-3, TNFa, CD40 ligand, LPS, flt3 ligand and/or other compound(s) that induce<br>
differentiation, maturation and proliferation of dendritic cells.<br>
Dendritic cells are conveniently categorized as "immature" and "mature" cells, which<br>
allows a simple way to discriminate between two well characterized phenotypes.<br>
However, this nomenclature should not be construed to exclude all possible intermediate<br>
stages of differentiation. Immature dendritic cells are characterized as APC with a high<br>
capacity for antigen uptake and processing, which correlates with the high expression of<br>
Feg receptor and mannose receptor. The mature phenotype is typically characterized by a<br>
lower expression of these markers, but a high expression of cell surface molecules<br>
responsible for T cell activation such as class I and class II MHC, adhesion molecules<br>
(e.g., CD54 and CD11) and costimulatory molecules (e.g., CD40, CD80, CD86 and 4-<br>
1BB).<br>
APCs may generally be transfected with a polynucleotide of the invention (or portion or<br>
other variant thereof) such that the encoded polypeptide, or an immunogenic portion<br>
thereof, is expressed on the cell surface. Such transfection may take place ex vivo, and a<br>
pharmaceutical composition comprising such transfected cells may then be used for<br>
therapeutic purposes, as described herein. Alternatively, a gene delivery vehicle that<br>
targets a dendritic or other antigen presenting cell may be administered to a patient,<br>
resulting in transfection that occurs in vivo. In vivo and ex vivo transfection of dendritic<br>
cells, for example, may generally be performed using any methods known in the art, such<br>
as those described in WO 97/24447, or the gene gun approach described by Mahvi et al.,<br>
Immunology and cell Biology 75:456-460,1997. Antigen loading of dendritic cells may be<br>
achieved by incubating dendritic cells or progenitor cells with the tumor polypeptide, DNA<br>
(naked or within a plasmid vector) or RNA; or with antigen-expressing recombinant<br>
bacterium or viruses (e.g., vaccinia, fowlpox, adenovirus or lentivirus vectors). Prior to<br>
loading, the polypeptide may be covalently conjugated to an immunological partner that<br>
provides T cell help (e.g., a carrier molecule). Alternatively, a dendritic cell may be pulsed<br>
with a non-conjugated immunological partner, separately or in the presence of the<br>
polypeptide.<br>
Definitions<br>
Also provided by the invention are methods for the analysis of character sequences or<br>
strings, particularly genetic sequences or encoded protein sequences. Preferred methods of<br>
sequence analysis include, for example, methods of sequence homology analysis, such as<br>
identity and similarity analysis, DNA, RNA and protein structure analysis, sequence<br>
assembly, cladistic analysis, sequence motif analysis, open reading frame determination,<br>
nucleic acid base calling, codon usage analysis, nucleic acid base trimming, and sequencing<br>
chromatogram peak analysis.<br>
A computer based method is provided for performing homology identification. This method<br>
comprises the steps of: providing a first polynucleotide sequence comprising the sequence<br>
of a polynucleotide of the invention in a computer readable medium; and comparing said first<br>
polynucleotide sequence to at least one second polynucleotide or polypeptide sequence to<br>
identify homology. A computer based method is also provided for performing homology<br>
identification, said method comprising the steps of: providing a first polypeptide sequence<br>
comprising the sequence of a polypeptide of the invention in a computer readable medium;<br>
and comparing said first polypeptide sequence to at least one second polynucleotide or<br>
polypeptide sequence to identify homology.<br>
"Identity," as known in the art, is a relationship between two or more polypeptide sequences or<br>
two or more polynucleotide sequences, as the case may be, as determined by comparing the<br>
sequences. In the art, "identity" also means the degree of sequence relatedness between<br>
polypeptide or polynucleotide sequences, as the case may be, as determined by the match<br>
between strings of such sequences. "Identity" can be readily calculated by known methods,<br>
including but not limited to those described in (Computational Molecular Biology, Lesk, A.M.,<br>
ed., Oxford University Press, New York, 1988; Biocomputing: Informatics and Genome<br>
Projects, Smith, D.W., ed., Academic Press, New York, 1993; Computer Analysis of<br>
Sequence Data, Part I, Griffin, A.M., and Griffin, H.G., eds., Humana Press, New Jersey,<br>
1994; Sequence Analysis in Molecular Biology, von Heine, G., Academic Press, 1987; and<br>

York, 1991; and Carillo. H., and Lipman, D., SIAM J. Applied Math., 48: 1073 (1988).<br>
Methods to determine identity are designed to give the largest match between the<br>
sequences tested. Moreover, methods to determine identity are codified in publicly available<br>
computer programs. Computer program methods to determine identity between two<br>
sequences include, but are not limited to, the GAP program in the GCG program package<br>
(Devereux, J., et al., Nucleic Acids Research 12(1): 387 (1984)), BLASTP, BLASTN<br>

and wherein said number of amino acid alterations is determined by multiplying the total<br>

The invention will be further described by reference to the following examples:<br>
EXAMPLE I: Preparation of the recombinant Yeast strain Y1796 expressing P501<br>
Fusion Protein containing a C-LytA-P2-C-LvtA (CPC) as fusion partner<br>
1. -Protein design<br>
The structure of the fusion protein C-P2-C-p501 (alternatively named CPC-P501) to<br>
be expressed in S. cerevisiae is depicted in figure 3. This fusion contains the C-terminal<br>
region of gene LytA (residues 187 to 306), in which the P2 fragment of tetanus toxin<br>
(residues 830-843) has been inserted. The P2 fragment is placed between the residues<br>
277 and 278 of C-Lyt-A. The C-lytA fragment containing the P2 insertion is followed by<br>
P501 (residues amino acid 51 to 553) and by the His tail.<br>
The primary structure of the resulting fusion protein has the sequence described in<br>
figure 4 and the coding sequence corresponding to the above protein design is in figure 5.<br>
2. - Cloning strategy for the generation of a yeast plasmid expressing CPC-P501<br>
(51-553)-Hls fusion protein<br>
• The starting material is the yeast vector pRIT15068 (UK patent application 0015619.0).<br>
• This vector contains the yeast Cup1 promoter, the yeast alpha prepro signal coding<br>
sequence and the coding sequence corresponding to residues 55 to 553 of P501S<br>
followed by His tail.<br>
• The cloning strategy outlined in figure 6 include the following steps:<br>
a) The first step is the insertion of P2 sequence (codon-optimised for yeast<br>
expression) in frame, inside the C-lytA coding sequence. The C-lytA coding sequence is<br>
harbored by plasmid pRIT 14662 (PCT/EP99/00660). The insertion is done using an<br>
adaptor formed by two complementary oligonucleotides named P21 and P22 into the<br>
plasmid pRIT 14662 previously open by Ncol<br>
The sequence of P21 and P22 is:<br>
P21 5" catgcaatacatcaaggctaactctaagttcattggtatcactgaaggcgt 3"<br>
P22 3" gttatgtagttccgattgagattcaagtaaccatagtgacttccgcagtac 5"<br>
After ligation and transformation of E. coli and transformant characterization, the<br>
plasmid named pRIT15199 is obtained.<br>
b) The second step is the preparation of C-lytA-P2-C-lytA DNA fragment by PCR<br>
amplification. The amplification is performed using pRIT15199 as template and the<br>
oligonucleotides named C-LytANOTATG and C-LytA-aa55. The sequence of both<br>
oligonucleotides being:<br>
C-LytANOTATG<br>
=5"aaaaccatggcggccgcttacgtacattccgacggctcttatccaaaagacaag3"<br>
C-LytA-aa55 =5"aaacatgtacatgaacttttctggcctgtctgccagtgttc 3"<br>
The amplified fragment is treated with the restriction enzymes Ncol and Afl III to<br>
generate the respective cohesive ends.<br>
c) The next step is the ligation of the above fragment with vector pRIT15068 (largest<br>
fragment obtained after Ncol treatment) to generate the complete fusion protein coding<br>
sequence. After ligation and E. coli transformation the plasmid named pRIT15200 is<br>
obtained. In this plasmid the remaining unique Nco1 site contains the ATG coding for the<br>
start codon.<br>
d) In the next step a Ncol fragment containing the CUP1 promoter and a portion of 2µ<br>
plasmid sequences is prepared from plasmid PRIT 15202. Plasmid pRIT 15202 is a yeast<br>
2µ derivative containing the CUP1 promoter with an Ncol site at ATG ( ATG sequence:<br>
AAACC ATG )<br>
e) The Ncol fragment isolated from pRIT 15202 is ligated to pRIT15200, previously<br>
open with Ncol, in the righ orientation, in such a way the pCUP1 promoter is at the 5" side<br>
of the coding sequence. This results in the generation of a final expression plasmid named<br>
pRIT15201 (see figure 7).<br>
3. - Preparation of the recombinant yeast strain Y1796 (RIX4440)<br>
The plasmid pRIT 15201 is used to transform the S. cerevisiae strain DC5 (ATCC<br>
20820). After selection and characterisation of the yeast transformants containing the<br>
plasmid pRIT 15201 a recombinant yeast strain named Y1796 expressing CPC-P501-His<br>
fusion protein is obtained. The protein after reduction and carboxyamidation, is isolated<br>
and purified by affinity chromatography (IMAC) followed by anion exchange<br>
chromatography (Q Sepharose FF).<br>
Example II<br>
In analogous fashion proteins constructs as depicted in figure 2 may be expressed utilising<br>
the corresponding ONA sequences shown therein. In particular, yeast strain SC333<br>
(construct 2) corresponds to Y1796 strain but expressing P50155.553 devoid of the CPC<br>
fusion partner. Yeast strain Y1800 (construct 3) corresponds to Y1796 strain but<br>
additionally comprises the native sequence signal for P501S (aa1-aa34), while yeast strain<br>
Y1802 (construct 4) comprises the alpha pre signal sequence upstream CPC-P501S<br>
sequence. Yeast strain Y1790 (construct 5) is expressing a P501S construct devoid of<br>
CPC and having the alpha prepro signal sequence.<br>
Example III. Preparation of purified CPC-P501<br>
1. - Production of CPC-P501S HIS (Y1796) at small scale<br>
For Y1796, in minimal medium supplemented with histidine, expression is induced in log<br>
phase by addition of CuSO4 ranging from 100 to 500 mM, and culture is maintained at 30°.<br>
Cells are harvested after 8 or 24H induction. Copper is added just before use and not<br>
mixed with medium in advance.<br>
For SDS PAGE analysis, yeast cells extraction is performed in citrate phosphate buffer<br>
pH4.0 + 130 mM NaCI. Extraction is performed with glass beads for small cell quantity and<br>
with French press for higher cells quantity, and then mixed with sample buffer and SDS-<br>
PAGE analysed. Results of comparative analysis on SDS PAGE of the different constructs<br>
are depicted in figure 8 and summariosed in Table 2 below.<br>
As shown in Table 1 below, the level of expression of the culture is much higher for Y1796<br>
strain as compared to the expression level of parent strain SC333. a strain expressing the<br>
corresponding P501S-His devoid of CPC partner. Likewise, the presence of a signal<br>
sequence (alpha pre) does not affect the results discussed above: the level of expression<br>
of the culture is much higher for Y1802 strain as compared to the expression level of<br>
corresponding strain Y1790, a strain expressing the corresponding P501S-His devoid of<br>
CPC partner.<br>
2. - Fermentation of Y1796 (RIX4440) at larger scale<br>
100pl of the working seed are spread on solid medium and grown for approximately 24h at<br>
30°C. This solid pre-culture is then used to inoculate a liquid pre-culture in shake flasks.<br>
This liquid pre-culture is grown for 20h at 30°C and transferred into a 20L fermenter. The<br>
fed-batch fermentation includes a growth phase of about 44h and an induction phase of<br>
about 22h.<br>
The carbon source (glucose) was supplemented to the culture by a continuous feeding.<br>
The residual glucose concentration was maintained very low (=50mg/L) in order to<br>
minimise the ethanol production by fermentation. This was realised by limiting the<br>
development of the micro-organism by limited glucose feed rate.<br>
At the end of the growth phase, CUP1 promoter is induced by adding CuS04 in order to<br>
produce the antigen.<br>
The absence of contaminations was checked by inoculating 106 cells into standard TSB<br>
and THI vials supplemented with nystatine and incubated respectively for 14 days at 20-<br>
25°C and at 30-35°C. No growth was observed as expected.<br>
3. - Antigen characterisation and productivity<br>
Cell homogenates were prepared by French pressing of fermentation samples harvested at<br>
different times during the induction phase and analysed by SDS-PAGE and Western Blot. It<br>
was shown that the major part of the protein of interest was located in the insoluble fraction<br>
obtained from the cell homogenate after centrifugation. The SDS-PAGE and Western Blot<br>
analyses shown in the Figures below were realised on the pellets obtained after<br>
centrifugation of these cell homogenates.<br>
Figures 8 A and B show a kinetics of the antigen production during the induction phase for<br>
culture PRO127. It appears that no antigen expression occurred during the growth phase.<br>
The specific antigen productivity seems to increase from the beginning of the induction<br>
phase up to 6h and then remained quite stable up to the end. But the volumetric<br>
productivity increased by a factor 1.5 to 2 due to biomass accumulation observed during<br>
the same period of time. The antigen productivity was estimated at about 500 mg per litre<br>
of fermentation broth by comparing purified reference of the antigen and crude extracts on<br>
SDS-PAGE with silver staining (figure 9A) and WB analyses using an anti-P501S antibody<br>
(a murine ascite directed against P501S aa439-aa459 used at a dilution of 1/1000) (figure<br>
9B).<br>
Example IV. Purification of CPC-P501 (51-553)-His fusion protein produced by Y1796<br>
After the cell breakage, the protein is associated with the pellet fraction. A carbamido-<br>
methylation of the molecule has been introduced in the process in order to cope with the<br>
oxidative aggregation of the molecule with itself or with host cell protein contaminants<br>
through covalent bridging with disulphide bonds. The use of detergents has also been<br>
required to manage the hydrophobic character of this protein (12 trans-membrane domains<br>
predicted).<br>
The purification protocol, developed for the scale of 1 L of culture OD (optical<br>
density) 120, is described in figure 10. All the operations are performed at room<br>
temperature (RT).<br>
According to DOC TCA BCA protein assay, the global purification yield is 30 - 70 mg of<br>
purified antigen / L of culture OD 120. The yield is linked to the level of expression of the<br>
culture and is higher as compared to the purification yield of parent strain expressing<br>
unfused P501S-His.<br>
The protein assay is performed as followed: proteins are first precipitated using TCA<br>
(trichloroacetic acid) in the presence of DOC (deoxycholate) then dissolved in a alcaline<br>
medium in the presence of SDS. The proteins then react with BCA (bicinchoninic acid)<br>
(Pierce) to form a soluble purple complex presenting a high adsorbance at 562 nm, which<br>
is proportional to the amount of proteins present in the sample.<br>
SDS-PAGE analysis of 3 purified bulks (figure 11) shows no difference in reducing and<br>
non reducing conditions (cf. lanes 2, 3 and 4 versus lanes 5, 6 and 7). The pattern<br>
consists of a major band at 70 kDa, a smear of higher MW and faint degradation bands. All<br>
the bands are detected by a specific anti P501S monoclonal antibody.<br>
Example V. Vaccine preparation using CPC- P501S His protein<br>
The protein of Example 3 or 4 can be formulated into a vaccine containing QS21<br>
and 3D-MPL in an oil in water emulsion.<br>
1. - Vaccine preparation:<br>
The antigen produced as shown in Example 1 to 3 a C-LytA - P2 - P501S His. As<br>
an adjuvant, the formulation comprises a mixture of 3 de -O-acylated monophosphoryl lipid<br>
A (3D-MPL) and QS21 in an oil/water emulsion. The adjuvant system SBAS2 has been<br>
previously described WO 95/17210.<br>
3D-MPL: is an immunostimulant derived from the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of the<br>
Gram-negative bacterium Salmonella minnesota. MPL has been deacylated and is lacking<br>
a phosphate group on the lipid A moiety. This chemical treatment dramatically reduces<br>
toxicity while preserving the immunostimulant properties (Ribi, 1986). Ribi<br>
Immunochemistry produces and supplies MPL to SB-Biologicals.<br>
Experiments performed at Smith Kline Beecham Biologicals have shown that<br>
3D-MPL combined with various vehicles strongly enhances both the humoral and a TH1<br>
type of cellular immunity.<br>
QS21: is a natural saponin molecule extracted from the bark of the South American<br>
tree Quillaja saponaria Molina. A purification technique developed to separate the<br>
individual saponins from the crude extracts of the bark, permitted the isolation of the<br>
particular saponin, QS21, which is a triterpene glycoside demonstrating stronger adjuvant<br>
activity and lower toxicity as compared with the parent component. QS21 has been shown<br>
to activate MHC class I restricted CTLs to several subunit Ags, as well as to stimulate Ag<br>
specific lymphocytic proliferation (Kensil, 1992). Aquila (formally Cambridge Biotech<br>
Corporation) produces and supplies QS21 to SB-Biologicals.<br>
Experiments performed at SmithKline Beecham Biologicals have demonstrated a<br>
clear synergistic effect of combinations of MPL and QS21 in the induction of both humoral<br>
and TH1 type cellular immune responses.<br>
The oil/water emulsion is composed an organic phase made of of 2 oils<br>
(a tocopherol and squalene), and an aqueous phase of PBS containing Tween 80 as<br>
emulsifier. The emulsion comprised 5% squalene 5% tocopherol 0.4% Tween 80 and had<br>
an average particle size of 180 nm and is known as SB62 (see WO 95/17210).<br>
Experiments performed at SmithKline Beecham Biologicals have proven that the<br>
adjunction of this O/W emulsion to 3D-MPL/QS21 (SBAS2) further increases the<br>
immunostimulant properties of the latter against various subunit antigens.<br>
2. - Preparation of emulsion SB62 (2 fold concentrate):<br>
Tween 80 is dissolved in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to give a 2% solution in<br>
the PBS. To provide 100 ml two fold concentrate emulsion 5g of DL alpha tocopherol and<br>
5ml of squalene are vortexed to mix thoroughly. 90ml of PBS/Tween solution is added and<br>
mixed thoroughly. The resulting emulsion is then passed through a syringe and finally<br>
microfluidised by using an M110S microfluidics machine. The resulting oil droplets have a<br>
size of approximately 180 nm.<br>
3. - Formulations:<br>
A typical formulation containing 3D-MPL and QS21 in an oil/water emulsion is<br>
performed as follows: 20mg - 25 mg C-LytA P2-P501S are diluted in 10 fold concentrated<br>
of PBS pH 6.8 and H2O before consecutive addition of SB62 (50ml), MPL (20mg), QS21<br>
(20mg), optionally comprising CpG oligonucleotide (100 pg) and 1 µg/ml thiomersal as<br>
preservative. The amount of each component may vary as necessary. All incubations are<br>
carried out at room temperature with agitation.<br>
Example VI. Codon-optimised P501S sequences<br>
1. - Generation of the control recombinant plasmids:<br>
Full-length P501S sequence was cloned into pVAC (Thomsen, Immunology, 1998;<br>
95:51OP105), generating expression plasmid JNW680. SEQ ID NO:17 represents human<br>
P501S expression cassette in the plasmid JNW680 and is illustrated in Figure 12. The<br>
protein sequence of SEQ ID NO: 17 is shown in single letter format, the start and stop<br>
codons being shown in bold. The Kozak sequence is denoted by the hash symbols. The<br>
codon usage index of the human P501S sequence (SEQ ID NO: 17) is 0.618, as calculated<br>
by the SynGene programme.<br>
SvnGene programme<br>
Basically, the codons are assigned using a statistical method to give synthetic gene<br>
having a codon frequency closer to that found naturally in highly expressed E.coli and<br>
human genes.<br>
SynGene is an updated version of the Visual Basic program called Calcgene,<br>
written by R. S. Hale and G Thompson (Protein Expression and Purification Vol. 12<br>
pp. 185-188 (1998). For each amino acid residue in the original sequence, a codon was<br>
assigned based on the probability of it appearing in highly expressed E.coli genes. Details<br>
of the Calcgene program, which works under Microsoft Windows 3.1, can be obtained from<br>
the authors. Because the program applies a statistical method to assign codons to the<br>
synthetic gene, not all resulting codons are the most frequently used in the target<br>
organism. Rather, the proportion of frequently and infrequently used codons of the target<br>
organism is reflected in the synthetic sequence by assigning codons in the correct<br>
proportions. However, as there is no hard-and-fast rule assigning a particular codon to a<br>
particular position in the sequence, each time it is run the program will produce a different<br>
synthetic gene - although each will have the same codon usage pattern and each will<br>
encode the same amino acid sequence. If the program is run several times for a given<br>
amino acid sequence and a given target organism, several different nucleotide sequences<br>
will be produced which may differ in the number, type and position of restriction sites,<br>
intron splice signals etc., some of which may be undesirable. The skilled artisan will be<br>
able to select an appropriate sequence for use in expression of the polypeptide on the<br>
basis of these features.<br>
Furthermore, since the codons are randomly assigned on a statistical basis, it is<br>
possible (although perhaps unlikely) that two or more codons which are relatively rarely<br>
used in the target organism might be clustered in close proximity. It is believed that such<br>
clusters may upset the machinery of translation and result in particularly low expression<br>
rates, so the algorithm for choosing the codons in the optimized gene excludes any codons<br>
with an RSCU value of less than 0.2 for highly expressed genes in order to prevent any<br>
rare codon clusters being fortuitously selected. The distribution of the remaining codons is<br>
then allocated according to the frequencies for highly expressed E.coli to give an overall<br>
distribution within the synthetic gene that is typical such genes (coefficient = 0.85) and also<br>
for highly expressed human genes (coefficient = 0.50).<br>
Syngene (Peter Ertl, unpublished), an updated version of the Calcgene program,<br>
allows exclusion of rare codons to be optional, and is also used to allocate codons<br>
according to the codon frequency pattern of highly expressed human genes.<br>
The sequence of the CPC-PSOIS cassette cloned from the vector pRIT15201 (see<br>
Figure 7) into pVAC, thereby generating plasmid JNW735, is set forth in SEQ ID NO: 18<br>
and is illustrated in Figure 13. This sequence is identical to the pRIT15201 sequence with<br>
the exception of the removal of the His tag and the addition of a Kozak sequence<br>
(GCCACC) and appropriate restriction enzyme sites. The amino acid sequence of SEQ ID<br>
NO: 18 is shown in single letter format, the start and stop codons are shown in bold. The<br>
boxed residues are the P2 helper epitope of tetanus toxoid. The underlined residues are<br>
the Clyta purification tag. The Kozak sequence is denoted by the hash symbols.<br>
2. - Generation of the recombinant plasmids with P501S codon optimised<br>
sequences:<br>
Although the codon coefficient index (CI) of P501S native sequence is already high<br>
(0.618), it is possible increase the CI value further. This will have two potential benefits - to<br>
improve the antigen expression and/or immunogenicity and to reduce the possibility for<br>
recombination between the P501S vector and genomic sequences.<br>
Using the Syngene programme, a selection (SEQ ID NO: 19 to SEQ ID NO:20) of codon<br>
optimised sequences was obtained (Figure 14). Table 3 below shows a comparison of the<br>
codon coefficient index for the starting P501S sequence and the two representative codon<br>
optimised sequences, selected on the basis of a suitable restriction enzyme site profile and<br>
a good CI index.<br>
3. Further evaluation of the codon-optimised sequences<br>
Sequence SEQ ID NO: 19<br>
Although SEQ ID NO: 19 has a good CI index (0.725), it contains a doublet of rare codons<br>
at amino acids position 202 and 203. These codons were manually substituted with more<br>
frequent codons by changing the DNA sequence from TTGTTG to CTGCTG. To facilitate<br>
cloning and expression, restriction enzyme sites and a Kozak sequence were added. The<br>
final engineered sequence (SEQ ID NO.21) is shown in Figure 15. The Syngene<br>
programme was used to fragment this sequence into oligonucleotides with a minimum<br>
overlap of 19-20 bases. Therefore, Figure 15 shows the re-engineered P501S codon<br>
optimised SEQ ID NO. 19. Restriction enzyme sites are underlined, Kozak sequence is<br>
bolded, re-engineered DNA sequence to remove a rare codon doublet is boxed.<br>
Using a two-step PCR protocol, the overlapping primers generated by the Syngene<br>
programme were first assembled using a PCR Assembly protocol (detailed below). The<br>
assembly reaction generates a diverse population of fragments. The correct full-length<br>
fragment was recovered/amplified using the PCR recovery protocol and the terminal<br>
primers. The resulting PCR fragment was excised from an agarose gel, purified, restricted<br>
with Nhel and Xhol and cloned into pVAC. Positive clones were identified by restriction<br>
enzyme analysis and confirmed by double-stranded sequencing. This generates plasmid<br>
JNW766, which, due to the error-prone nature of the PCR process, contained a single<br>
silent mutation (C to T at position 360 of SEQ ID NO: 21).<br>

Sequence SEQ ID NO:20<br>
Although SEQ ID NO: 20 has a very good CI index (0.755), it was noticed that it contained<br>
a doublet of rare codons at amino acids position 131 and 132. These codons were<br>
manually substituted with more frequent codons by changing the DNA sequence from<br>
TTGTTG to CTGCTG. To facilitate cloning, an internal BamHI site was removed by<br>
mutating G to C (see the double-underlined nucleotide in Figure 16). To facilitate cloning<br>
and expression, restriction enzyme sites and a Kozak sequence were added. The final<br>
engineered sequence (SEQ ID NO:22) is shown in Figure 16. The Syngene programme<br>
was used to fragment this sequence into oligonucleotides with a minimum overlap of 19-20<br>
bases.<br>
Figure 16 therefore shows the re-engineered P501S codon optimised sequence 20 (SEQ<br>
ID NO:22). Restriction enzyme sites are underlined, Kozak sequence is bolded, re-<br>
engineered DNA sequence to remove a rare codon doublet is boxed and a silent point<br>
mutation to remove a BamHI site is double-underlined.<br>
Using a similar two-step PCR protocol to the one described above, full-length P501S<br>
fragment was amplified and cloned into pVAC. Positive clones were identified by restriction<br>
enzyme analysis and confirmed by double-stranded sequencing. This generates plasmid<br>
JNW764. The sequence of the P501S coding cassette is shown in Figure 16 (SEQ ID NO:<br>
22).<br>
DNA Sequence similarity<br>
Pair distances following alignment by the ClustalV (weighted) method are shown in Table 3<br>
below. Table 4 below shows percent similarity between the starting human P501S<br>
sequence and the two codon optimised sequences SEQ ID NO:21 and 22 selected for<br>
further investigation. The data confirms that the codon optimised DNA sequences are<br>
approximately 80% similar to the original P501S sequence.<br>
Example VII. Codon-optimlsed CPC sequences<br>
1.- Approach<br>
Since the original CPC sequence was originally designed for optimal expression in yeast,<br>
this section describes the process of codon optimising for human expression.<br>
2.- Sequence design<br>
The starting sequence for the optimisation of CPC is shown in Figure 17 (SEQ ID NO: 23).<br>
This is derived entirely from the pRIT15201 and contains the entire coding sequence of<br>
CPC plus four amino acids of P501S to facilitate downstream cloning. Using the Syngene<br>
programme, a selection of codon optimised sequences were obtained, from which<br>
representative sequences are shown in Figure 18 (SEQ ID NO: 24-25). Table 5 below<br>
shows a comparison of the codon coefficient index for the starting CPC sequence and the<br>
two representative codon optimised sequences.<br>
In addition to the codon optimisation, all sequences were also screened for restriction<br>
enzyme cloning sites. On the basis of the highest CI value and a favourable restriction<br>
enzyme site profile, SEQ ID NO: 24 was selected for construction. To facilitate cloning<br>
and expression, 5" and 3" cloning sites were added and a Kozak sequence (GCCACC) was<br>
inserted 5" of the initiating ATG start codon. This engineered sequence is shown in Figure<br>
19 (SEQ ID NO:26). This sequence includes four amino aicds of P501S (boxed), restriction<br>
enzyme cloning sites (Nhel and Xhol, underlined), a Kozak sequence (Bold), a stop codon<br>
(italicised) and 4bp of flanking irrelevant DNA to facilitate cloning.<br>
The Syngene programme was used to fragment this sequence into 50-60-mer<br>
oligonucleotides with a minimum overlap of 18-20 bases .<br>
Using a similar two-step PCR protocol to the one described above, the correct fragment<br>
was recovered/amplified and cloned into pVAC. Positive clones were identified by<br>
restriction enzyme analysis and sequence verified generating vector JNW759.<br>
4.-DNA similarity<br>
Pair Distances following alignment ClustalV (Weighted) are shown in Table 6 below. The<br>
table shows percent similarity at the DNA level between the starting sequence of CPC and<br>
the codon optimised sequence and confirms that the codon optimised sequences are<br>
approximately 80% similar to the original CPC sequence.<br>
Example VIII. Construction of the P501S fusion candidate<br>
All the candidates shown in the schematic below are codon optimised and constructed<br>
using overlapping PCR methodologies from plasmids JNW764 and JNW759 as templates<br>
(SEQ ID NO: 22 and SEQ ID NO: 26 respectively), and cloned into the expression vector<br>
p7313ie.<br>
The four candidates shown schematically below are based upon CPC-P501S. Codon<br>
optimised CPC-P501S is construct A. Candidates B, C, D also include the sequence<br>
encoding the N terminal 50 amino acids of P501S, positioned either at the N terminus of<br>
CPC-P501S (construct D), the C terminus of CPC-P501S (construct C), or between CPC<br>
and P501S (construct B). A schematic representation of the constructs is given in Figure<br>
20.<br>
The nucleotide and protein sequence for each of the four constructs is shown in SEQ ID<br>
NO: 37-40 for the nucleotide sequences, and SEQ ID NO. 45-48 for the corresponding<br>
polypeptide sequences. In constructs A, C and D, the underlined codon preferentially<br>
encodes tyrosine (either TAC or TAT) but the nucleotide sequence may be altered to<br>
encode threonine (either ACA, ACC, ACG or ACT). In construct B, the underlined codon<br>
preferentially encodes threonine (either ACA, ACC, ACG or ACT), but the nucleotide<br>
sequence may be altered to encode tyrosine (either TAC or TAT). In all constructs, the<br>
coding sequence is flanked by appropriate restriction enzyme cloning sites (in this case,<br>
Notl and BamHI), and a Kozak sequence immediately upstream of the initiating ATG.<br>
Table 7 below shows the plasmid identification for the constructs detailed above:<br>
The cellular responses following immunisation with p7313-ie (empty vector), PVAC-P501S<br>
(JNW735), JNW770, JNW771 and JNW773 were assessed by ELISPOT following a<br>
primary immunisation by PMID at day 0 and three boosts at day 21, 42 and 70. Assays<br>
were carried out 7 days post boost. Figure 27 shows that good IL-2 ELISPOT responses<br>
were detected in mice immunised with JNW770, JNW771 and JNW773.<br>
Example IX. Immunoqentcitv experiments using particle-mediated intra-dermal<br>
delivery (PMID) studies<br>
Full-length P501S, when delivered by particle mediated intra-dermal delivery (PMID),<br>
generates good antibody &amp; cellular responses. These data demonstrate that the PMID is a<br>
very effective delivery route. Furthermore, comparison of P501S and CPC-P501S confirms<br>
that CPC-P501S induces a stronger immune response as determined by peptide<br>
ELISPOT.<br>
1.- Materials &amp; Methods<br>
1.1. Cutaneous gene gun immunisation<br>
Plasmid DNA was precipitated onto 2µm diameter gold beads using calcium chloride and<br>
spermidine. Loaded beads were coated onto Tefzel tubing as described (Eisenbraurn et al,<br>
1993; Pertmer et al, 1996). Particle bombardment was performed using the Accell gene<br>
delivery system (PCT WO 95/19799). For each plasmid, female C57BL/6 mice were<br>
immunised on days 0, 21, 42 and 70. Each administration consisted of two bombardments<br>
with DNA/gold, providing a total dose of approximately 4-5 µg of plasmid.<br>
1.2. ELISPOT assays for T cell responses to the P501S gene product<br>
a) Preparation of splenocvtes<br>
Spleens were obtained from immunised animals at 7-14 days post boost. Spleens were<br>
processed by grinding between glass slides to produce a ceii suspension. Red blood ceils<br>
were lysed by ammonium chloride treatment and debris was removed to leave a fine<br>
suspension of splenocytes. Cells were resuspended at a concentration of 8x10º/ml in<br>
RPMI complete media for use in ELISPOT assays.<br>
b) Screening of peptide library<br>
A peptide library covering a majority of the P501S sequence was obtained from Corixa<br>
Corp. The library contained fifty 15-20mer peptides overlapping by 4-11 amino acids<br>
peptides. The peptides are numbered 1-50. In addition, a prediction programme (H-G.<br>
Rammensee, et al.: Immunogenetics, 1999, 50: 213-219) (http://svfpeithi.bmi-<br>
heidelberq.com/) was used to predict putative Kb and Db epitopes from the P501S<br>
sequence. The ten best epitopes for Kb and Db were ordered from Mimotopes (UK) and<br>
included in the library (peptides 51-70). For screening of the peptide library, peptides were<br>
used at a final concentration of 50µg/ml (approx. 25-50mM) in IFNy and IL-2 ELISPOTS<br>
using the protocol described below. For IFNv ELISPOTS, IL-2 was added to the assays at<br>
10ng/ml. Splenocytes used for the screening were taken at day 84 from C57BL/6 mice<br>
immunised at day 0, 21,42 and 70. Three peptides were identified from the library screen<br>
- Peptides 18 (HCRQAYSVYAFMISLGGCLG), 22 (GLSAPSLSPHCCPCRARLAF) and 48<br>
(VCLAAGITYVPPLLLEVGV). These peptides were subsequently used in the ELISPOT<br>
assays<br>
c) ELISPOT assay<br>
Plates were coated with 15mg/ml (in PBS) rat anti mouse IFNg or rat anti mouse IL-2<br>
(Pharmingen). Plates were coated overnight at +4"C. Before use the plates were washed<br>
three times with PBS. Splenocytes were added to the plates at 4x105 cells/well. Peptides<br>
identified in the library screen were re-ordered from Genemed Synthesis and used at a<br>
final concentration of 5(mg/ml. CPC-P501S protein (GSKBio) was used in the assay at<br>
2mg/ml. ELISPOT assays were carried out in the presence of either IL-2 (10ng/ml), IL-7<br>
(10ng/ml) or no cytokine. Total volume in each well was 200ml. Plates containing peptide<br>
stimulated cells were incubated for 16 hours in a humidified 37ºC incubator.<br>
e) Development of ELISPOT assay plates.<br>
Cells were removed from the plates by washing once with water (with 10 minute soak to<br>
ensure lysis of cells) and three times with PBS. Biotin conjugated rat anti mouse IFNg or<br>
IL-2 (Phamingen) was added at 1mg/ml in PBS. Plates were incubated with shaking for 2<br>
hours at room temperature. Plates were then washed three times with PBS before addition<br>
of Streptavidin alkaline phosphatase (Caltag) at 1/1000 dilution. Following three washes in<br>
PBS spots were revealed by incubation with BCICP substrate (Biorad) for 15-45 mins.<br>
Substrate was washed off using water and plates were allowed to dry. Spots were<br>
enumerated using an image analysis system devised by Brian Hayes, Asthma Cell Biology<br>
unit, GSK.<br>
1.3. ELISA assay for antibodies to the P501S gene product<br>
Serum samples were obtained from the animals by venepuncture on days -1, 28, 49 and<br>
56, and assayed for the presence of anti-P501S antibodies. ELISA was performed using<br>
Nunc Maxisorp plates coated overnight at 4°C with 0.5mg/ml of CPC-P501S protein<br>
(GSKBio) in sodium bicarbonate buffer. After washing with TBS-Tween (Tris-buffered<br>
saline, pH 7.4 containing 0.05 % of Tween 20) the plates were blocked with Blocking buffer<br>
(3% BSA in TBS-Tween buffer) for 2hrs at room temperature. All sera were incubated at<br>
1:100 dilution for 1hr at RT in Blocking buffer. Antibody binding was detected using HRP-<br>
conjugated rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulins (#P0260, Dako) at 1:2000 dilution in<br>
Blocking buffer. Plates were washed again and bound conjugate detected using Fast OPD<br>
colour reagents (Sigma, UK). The reaction was stopped by the addition of 3M sulphuric<br>
acid, and the OPD product quantitated by measuring the absorbance at 490nm.<br>
1.4. Transient transfection assays<br>
Human P501S expression from various DNA constructs was analysed by transient<br>
transfection of the plasmids into CHO (Chinese hamster ovary) cells followed by Western<br>
blotting on total cell protein. Transient transfections were performed with the Transfectam<br>
reagent (Promega) according to the manufacturer"s guidelines. In brief, 24-well tissue<br>
culture plates were seeded with 5x104 CHO cells per well in 1ml DMEM complete medium<br>
(DMEM, 10% FCS, 2mM L-glutamine, penicillin 100IU/ml, streptomycin 100mg/ml) and<br>
incubated for 16 hours at 37ºC. 0.5mg DNA was added to 25ml of 0.3M NaCI (sufficient for<br>
one well) and 2ml of Transfectam was added to 25ml of Milli-Q. The DNA and Transfectam<br>
solutions were mixed gently and incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes. During this<br>
incubation step, the cells were washed once in PBS and covered with 150ml of serum free<br>
medium (DMEM, 2mM L-glutamine). The DNA-Transfectam solution was added drop wise<br>
to the cells, the plate gentle shaken and incubated at 37°C for 4-6 hours. 500ml of DMEM<br>
complete medium was added and the cells incubated for a further 48-72 hours at 37°C.<br>
2. Western blot analysis of CHO cells transiently transfected with P501S plasmids<br>
The transiently transfected CHO cells were washed with PBS and treated with a Versene<br>
(1:5000)/0.025% trypsin solution to transfer the cells into suspension. Following<br>
trypsinisation, the CHO cells were pelleted and resuspended in 50pl of PBS. An equal<br>
volume of 2x NP40 lysis buffer was added and the cells incubated on ice for 30 minutes.<br>
100ml of 2x TRIS-Glycine SDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) containing 50mM DTT was<br>
added and the solution heated to 95°C for 5 minutes. 1-20ml of sample was loaded onto a<br>
4-20% TRIS-Glycine Gel 1.5mm (Invitrogen) and electrophoresed at constant voltage<br>
(125V) for 90 minutes in 1x TRIS-Glycine buffer (Invitrogen). A pre-stained broad range<br>
marker (New England Biolabs, #P7708S) was used to size the samples. Following<br>
electrophoresis, the samples were transferred to Immobilon-P PVDF membrane<br>
(Millipore), pre-wetted in methanol, using an Xcell III Blot Module (Invitrogen), 1x Transfer<br>
buffer (Invitrogen) containing 20% methanol and a constant voltage of 25V for 90 minutes.<br>
The membrane was blocked overnight at 4°C in TBS-Tween (Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4<br>
containing 0.05 % of Tween 20) containing 3% dried skimmed milk (Marvel). The primary<br>
antibody (10E3) was diluted 1:1000 and incubated with the membrane for 1 hour at room<br>
temperature. Following extensive washing in TBS-Tween, the secondary antibody (HRP-<br>
conjugated rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulins (#P0260, Dako)) was diluted 1:2000 in<br>
TBS-Tween containing 3% dried skimmed milk and incubated with the membrane for one<br>
hour at room temperature. Following extensive washing, the membrane was incubated<br>
with Supersignal West Pico Chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) for 5 minutes. Excess<br>
liquid was removed and the membrane sealed between two sheets of cling film, and<br>
exposed to Hyperfilm ECL film (Amersham-PharmaciaBiotech) for 1-30 minutes.<br>
3. Generation of the Full-length human P501S expression cassette<br>
The starting point for the construction of a P501S expression cassette was the plasmid<br>
pcDNA3.1-P501S (Corixa Corp), which has a PCDNA3.1 backbone (Invitrogen) containing<br>
a full-length human P501S cDNA cassette cloned between the EcoRI and Notl sites. This<br>
vector is also termed JNW673. The presence of P501S was confirmed by fluorescent<br>
sequencing. The sequence of the cDNA cassette is given by the NCBI/Genbank sequence<br>
(accession number AY033593). Human P501S was PCR amplified from JNW673 template<br>
DNA, restricted with Xbal and Salt and cloned into the Nhel/Xhol sites of pVAC generating<br>
vector JNW680. The correct orientation of the fragment relative to the CMV promoter was<br>
confirmed by PCR and by DNA sequencing. The sequence of the expression cassette is<br>
shown in Figure 12 (SEQ ID NO: 17).<br>
To construct a CPC-P501S expression cassette, CPC-P501S was PCR amplified from the<br>
vector pRIT15201 (see Figure 7), restricted with Xbal and Sall and cloned into the Nhel<br>
and Xhol sites of pVAC, generating plasmid JNW735. The correct orientation was<br>
confirmed by PCR and sequencing. The sequence of the CPC-P501S expression cassette<br>
is shown in Figure 13 (SEQ ID NO: 18).<br>
4. Expression of human P501S from plasmids JNW680 and JNW735<br>
The P501S expression plasmids were transiently transfected into CHO cells and a total<br>
cell lysate prepared as described in methods. A Western blot of a total cell lysate identified<br>
single bands of approximately 55kDa and 62kDa for samples transfected with JNW680<br>
and JNW735 respectively (Figure 21). This is consistent with the predicted molecular<br>
weights of 59.3kDa and 63.3kDa for P501S and CPC-P501S respectively. The addition of<br>
the CPC tag does not adversely affect the expression of P501S.<br>
5. Results<br>
5.1. Antibody responses to human P501S following PMID immunisation<br>
The antibody responses following immunisation with pVAC (empty vector) and pVAC-<br>
P501S (JNW680) were assessed by ELISA following a primary immunisation by PMID at<br>
day 0 and three boosts at day 21 and day 42 and day 70. Figure 22 shows the antibody<br>
responses from sera taken at day -1, day 28 and day 49 (mice A1-3, B1-3) and day 56<br>
(mice A4-6, B4-9). Whilst there were some non-specific responses to the pVAC empty<br>
vector, specific responses to the P501S construct were seen in 5 of 9 mice.<br>
5.2. Identification of novel T cell epitopes from human P501S in C57BL/6 mice by<br>
screening of a P501S peptide library<br>
Following immunisation with JNW680 (PVAC-P501S) by PMID at day 0 and three boosts<br>
at day 21 and day 42 and day 70, ELISPOT assays were carried out at day 84. Peptides<br>
from the P501S library were tested at 50mg/ml final concentration. From this initial screen,<br>
three peptides were found to stimulate IFNg and/or IL-2 secretion. Peptides 18, 22 and 48<br>
(Figure 23). These peptides were used in subsequent cellular assays.<br>
5.3. Cellular responses to pVAC-P501S (JNW680) following PMID immunisation<br>
The cellular responses following immunisation with pVAC (empty vector) and pVAC-P501S<br>
were assessed by ELISPOT following a primary immunisation by PMID at day 0 and three<br>
boosts at day 21, 42 and 70. Assays were carried out 7 days post boost. Two different<br>
assay conditions were used: 1) Peptides 18, 22 and 48 identified in the peptide library<br>
screen used at 50µg/ml final concentration and 2) CPC-P501S protein used at 20µg/ml<br>
final concentration. Figure 24A shows that whilst there were no P501S-specific responses<br>
to the empty vector (A4-6), the pVAC-P501S construct induced specific IFN-g responses to<br>
Peptides 18 and 22 in all mice (B6-9) whilst one mouse (B7) also showed an IFN-?<br>
response to Peptide 48. Figure 24B shows that all mice showed specific IL-2 responses to<br>
Peptides 18, 22 and 48. Furthermore, pVAC-P501S immunised mice (B6-9) also showed<br>
moderate IL-2 responses to CPC-P501S, whereas the empty vector immunised mice (A4-<br>
6) showed no responses.<br>
5.4. Comparison of cellular responses to P501S and CPC-P501S following PMID<br>
immunisation.<br>
The cellular responses following immunisation with pVAC (empty vector), pVAC-P501S<br>
(JNW680) and CPC-P501S (JNW735) were assessed by ELISPOT following a primary<br>
immunisation by PMID at day 0 and boosts at day 21 and 42. Assays were carried out 7<br>
days post boost. Two different assay conditions were used: 1) Peptides 18, 22 and 48<br>
identified in the peptide library screen used at 50µg/ml final concentration and 2) CPC-<br>
P501S protein used at 20µg/ml final concentration. Figure 25 shows that at day 28, CPC-<br>
P501S induced good IL-2 responses to 10µg/ml of peptide 22, whilst there were no<br>
P501S-specific responses to either the empty vector or the pVAC-P501S. These results<br>
were also seen using CPC-P501S protein to re-stimulated the splenocytes. At day 49 (post<br>
2nd boost), the responses induced by P501S and CPC-P501S were equivalent. These data<br>
suggest that the addition of the CPC tag improves the kinetics and/or magnitude of the<br>
response to P501S.<br>
Example IX. Immunogenicity experiments in mice using P501S Protein + adjuvant<br>
studies<br>
1. Design and adjuvant formulation<br>
The immune response induced by vaccination using the recombinant purified CPC-P501S<br>
protein formulated in adjuvants is characterized in experiments performed in mice.<br>
Groups of 5 to 10,.eight weeks old female C57BL6 mice are vaccinated, 2-6 times intramuscularly<br>
at 2 weeks intervals with 10mg of the CPC-PSOIS protein formulated in<br>
different adjuvant systems. The volume administered corresponds to 1/10th of a human<br>
dose (50 µl).<br>
The serology (total Ig response) and cellular response (T cell lymphoproliferation and<br>
cytokine production) are analyzed on spleen cells, 6-14 days after the last vaccination<br>
using standard protocols as described in Gerard, c. et al, 2001, Vaccine 19, 2583-2589.<br>
The data of one representative experiment is shown. It included 5 groups of eight C57BI/6<br>
female mice which received 4 intramuscular injections of CPC P501 (10pg) +adjuvant (A,<br>
B, C) at days 0,14, 28, 42. Example V provides an experimental protocol of how to carry<br>
out the formulations. Briefly the adjuvant formulations are as follows (quantities given for<br>
one dose of 100ml)):<br>
- Adjuvant A: QS21 (10mg), MPL (10mg) and CpG7909 (100mg) made according to the<br>
method disclosed in WO 00/62800;<br>
- Adjuvant B: formulation of QS21 (20µg), MPL (20mg), CpG7909 (100 mg) and 50 ml<br>
SB62 oil-in-water emulsion (WO 95/17210);<br>
- Adjuvant C: formulation of QS21 (10mg), MPL (10mg), CpG7909 (100µg) and 10µl<br>
SB62 oil-in-water emulsion (WO 99/12565).<br>
2. Serology<br>
The total Ig response induced by vaccination was measured by ELISA using either the<br>
CPC-P501 or RA12 -P501 (C term, which is a truncated form of the P501 protein<br>
corresponding to the C terminus of the protein fused at its N terminus, to a TB derived<br>
protein RA12 - Ra12 is derived from MTB32A antigen described in Skeiky et al., Infection<br>
and Immun. (1999)67:3998-4007).<br>
The adjuvanted CPC-P501S proteins give a good antibody response after vaccination.<br>
3. Cellular response<br>
3.1. Lymphoproliferatlon<br>
7 days after the latest vaccine, lymphoproliferation was performed on spleen cells<br>
individually. 2.10e5 spleen cells were plated in quadruplicate, in 96 well microplate, in<br>
RPMI medium containing 1% normal mice serum. After 72 hours of re-stimulation with<br>
either the immunogen ( CPC-P501) or the truncated protein (RA12 P501) at different<br>
concentration , tmCi 3H thymidine (Amersham 5Ci/ml) was added. After 16 hours, cells<br>
were harvested onto filter plates. Incorporated radioactivity was counted in a b counter.<br>
Results are expressed in CPM or as stimulation indexes* (geomean CPM in cultures with<br>
antigen / geomean CPM in cultures without antigen).<br>
Re-stimulation with ConA (2mg/ml) as positive control was included as positive control.<br>
As shown in Figure 26, a P501 specific lymphoproliferation is seen in the spleen of all<br>
groups of mice receiving the adjuvanted protein after in vitro re-stimulation with either the<br>
immunogen or another P501 protein made in another expression system (E coli),<br>
indicating that T cells have been primed in vivo by the vaccination.<br>
3.2. IFNg production measured by intracellular staining of spleen cells<br>
Bone Marrow Dendritic Cells (BMDC) obtained after culture of mouse PBL for 7 days in<br>
the presence of GMCSF..<br>
7 days after the latest vaccine, spleen or PBL are collected and a cell suspension<br>
prepared. 10e6 cells (1 pool per group) were incubated +/-18hrs with 10e5 BMDC pulsed<br>
overnight with 10mg/ml of either the CPCp501 protein or the RA12.<br>
After a treatment with the 2.4.G.2 antibody, spleen cells were stained with fluorescent anti<br>
CD4 and CD8 antibodies (anti CD4-APC and an anti CD8PerCP). After a permeabilization<br>
and fixation step, cells were stained with a fluorescent anti IFNg-FITC antibody.<br>
In mice vaccinated with CPC P501 in different adjuvant, both CD4 and CD8 T cells are<br>
shown to produce IFNg in response to DC pulsed with either the immunogen and the C-<br>
term p501 made in E coli (as shown by intracellular straining of spleen and PBLs). There<br>
is an increase of 4-10X in the % of cells making this cytokine in the groups receiving the<br>
adjuvanted CPC-P501S compared to the protein alone, and between 0.1 to 10% of CD4 or<br>
CD8 T cells are shown to produce IFNg.<br>
In conclusion, these data allow to conclude that the adjuvanted CPC-P501 protein is<br>
immunogenic in mice.<br>
Both a P501 specific humoral and cellular responses including IFNg production by CD4<br>
and CD8 T cells can be detected after several intramuscular vaccination with CPC P501 in<br>
adjuvants.<br>
Example X. CPC-MUC-1 constructs and sequences<br>
CPC sequence is taken from nucleotide SEQ ID NO. 28.<br>
MUC1 sequence is available from Genbank database (accession number NM_002456).<br>
1.MUC1-CPC construct<br>
Due to the presence of a signal sequence in MUC1 that is cleaved post-translationally, the<br>
CPC motif was placed at the C-terminus. The resulting MUC1-CPC DNA sequence is<br>
depicted in SEQ ID NO. xx (figure 28A) and the corresponding MUC1-CPC protein<br>
sequence in SEQ ID NO. yy (figure 28B).<br>
2. ss-CPC-MUCI construct<br>
Due to the presence of a signal sequence in MUC1 that is cleaved post-translationally, the<br>
MUC1 signal sequence was replaced by a heterologous leader sequence (from the human<br>
immunoglobulin heavy chain) and the CPC motif was inserted between the heterologous<br>
leader sequence and the MUC1 sequence, generating a sequence termed ss-CPC-MUC1<br>
as depicted in figure 29.<br>
