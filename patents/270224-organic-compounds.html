				<td> ORGANIC COMPOUNDS<br>
The present invention refers to a novel class of 2,2,3-trimethylcyclopentane derivatives possessing an exceptional natural sandalwood oil odour profile. In addition the present invention refers to fragrance compositions comprising such derivatives.<br>
Sandalwood oils, in particular East India sandalwood oil, are among the most appreciated but unfortunately also most scarce perfumery raw materials. As a result, effective synthetic substitutes that will give the same natural odour, particularly for use in fine fragrances, have been sought for more than 50 years.<br>
Compounds based on a saturated ring system, such as 3-methyl-5-(2,2,3-trimethyl-cyclopentyl)pent-3-en-2-ol (A), are described, for example, in EP 0 466 019. According to the description, the odour notes are characterised as being fruity, flowery, with woody (in particular) side notes. According to Ernst-Joachim Brunke et al. (in "Fragrance Chemistry, the Science of the Sense of Smell"; Theimer E.T.; Ed., Academic Press, New York, 1982, pages 424 - 429) saturation of the double bond in the cyclopentene system of 2-methyl-4-(2,2,3-trimethylcyclopent-3-enyl)butan-1-ol (compound B wherein R = H) results in a weak dry-woody smell.<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
Brunke also observed that the loss of sandalwood odor is detectable after hydrogenation of 3-methyl-5-(2,2,3-trimethylcyclopent-3-enyl)pentan-2-ol (compound B wherein R is methyl) and of 4-methyl-6-(2,2,3-trimethylcyclopent-3-enyl)hexan-3-ol (compound B wherein R is ethyl).<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
Brunke finally stated that to get the fragrance of sandalwood a double bond at C-3 in the ring is necessary, which however can be replaced by a cyclopropane ring, an ether group or an environment with steric hindrance. With other words, the loss of the structural feature that enhances the electronic density in the cyclopropane ring system, which can be either a carbon-carbon double bond or an isolectronic cyclopropane ring is therefore most likely to bring about a loss or reduction of their typical sandalwood odour notes.<br>
Surprisingly, we have now found that certain 2,2,3-trimethylcyclopentane derivatives, i.e. compounds based on a saturated cyclopentane system, possess an exceptionally natural sandalwood oil odour.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention refers in one of its aspects to compounds of formula 1<br>
wherein <br>
R1 is methyl or ethyl; and<br>
R2 is hydrogen, methyl or ethyl.<br>
The compounds of formula 1 may comprise several chiral centres and as such may exist as a mixture of stereoisomers, or they may be resolved as isomerically pure forms. Resolving stereoisomers adds to the complexity of manufacture and purification of these compounds, and so it is preferred to use the compounds as mixtures of their stereoisomers simply for economic reasons. However, if it is desired to prepare individual stereoisomers, this may be achieved according to methods known in the art, e.g. preparative HPLC and GC, crystallization or by departing from chiral starting materials, e.g. starting from enantiomerically pure or enriched raw materials such as terpenoids, and/or by applying stereoselective synthesis.<br>
Thus, the present invention refers in a further aspect to compounds of formula 1 enriched in either a compound of formula 1/? or 1S, preferably in the ratio from about<br><br>
1:9 to about 9:1 (R/S), e.g. from about 2:3, or about 2:7 to about 6:1, or about 11:1, or pure enantiomers of compounds of formula 1, namely compounds of formula 1R or 1S<br>
(Formula Removed)  <br>
wherein R1 and R2 have the same meaning as given for formula 1 above.<br>
Particularly preferred compounds of formula 1 are [1-ethyl-2-[(2,2,3-trimethylcyclopentyl)methyl]cyclopropyl]methanol, [1-methyl-2-[(2,2,3-trimethylcyclopentyl)methyl]cyclopropyl]methanol and 1 -[1 -methyl-2-[(2,2,3-trimethylcyclopentyl)methyl]cyclopropyl]ethanol.<br>
The compounds according to the present invention may be used alone or in combination with known odorant molecules selected from the extensive range of natural and synthetic molecules currently available, such as essential oils and extracts, alcohols, aldehydes and ketones, ethers and acetals, esters and lactones, macrocycles and heterocycles, and/or in admixture with one or more ingredients or excipients conventionally used in conjunction with odorants in fragrance compositions, for example, carrier materials, and other auxiliary agents commonly used in the art.<br>
The following list comprises examples of known odorant molecules, which may be combined with the compounds of the present invention:<br>
-	essential oils and extracts, e.g. tree moss absolute, basil oil, fruit oils such as bergamot oil and mandarine oil, myrtle oil, palmarose oil, patchouli oil, petitgrain oil, jasmine oil, rose oil, sandalwood oil, wormwood oil, lavender oil or ylang-ylang oil;<br>
-	alcohols, e.g. cinnamic alcohol, cis-3-hexenol, citronellol, Ebanol®(3-methyl-5-(2,2,3-trimethyl-3-cyclopenten-1-yl)-4-penten-2-ol), eugenol, farnesol, geraniol, Super Muguet™(6-ethyl-3-methyl-6-octen-1-ol), linalool, menthol, nerol, phenylethyl alcohol, rhodinol, Sandalore*(5-(2,2,3-trimethyl-3-cyclopentenyl)-3-methylpentan-2-ol), terpineol or Timberol® (1-(2,2,6-trimethylcyclohexyl)hexan-3-ol);<br><br>
-	aldehydes and ketones, e.g. anisaldehyde, a-amylcinnamaldehyde, Georgywood<br>
(1-(1,2,8,8-tetramethyl-1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8-octahydronaphthalen-2-yl)ethanone),<br>
hydroxycitronellal, Iso E Super® (1-(2,3,8,8-tetramethyl-1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8-<br>
octahydronaphthalen-2-yl)ethanone), lsoraldeine®(4-(2,6,6-trimethyl-2-cyclohexenyl)-<br>
3-methyl-3-buten-2-one), Hedione® (methyl (3-oxo-2-pentylcyclopentyl)acetate), Lilial®<br>
(3-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-2-methylpropanal), maltol, methyl cedryl ketone, methylionone,<br>
verbenone or vanillin;<br>
-	ethers and acetals, e.g. Ambrox®(3a,6,6,9a-tetramethyldodecahydronaphtho[2,1-bjfuran), geranyl methyl ether, rose oxide or Spirambrene (2,2,3',7',7'-pentamethylspiro(1,3-dioxan-5,2'-norcarane));<br>
-	esters and lactones, e.g. benzyl acetate, cedryl acetate, y-decalactone, Helvetolide® (2-[1 -(3,3-dimethylcyclohexyl)ethoxy]-2-methylpropan-1 -ol propanoate), y-undecalactone or vetivenyl acetate;<br>
-	macrocycles, e.g. ambrettolide, ethylene brassylate or Exaltolide® (oxacyclohexadecan-2-one);<br>
-	heterocycles, e.g. isobutylquinoline.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may be used in a broad range of fragrance applications, e.g. in any field of fine and functional perfumery, such as perfumes, household products, laundry products, body care products and cosmetics. The compounds can be employed in widely varying amounts, depending upon the specific application and on the nature and quantity of other odorant ingredients. The proportion is typically from 0.001 to 20 weight percent of the application. In one embodiment, compounds of the present invention may be employed in a fabric softener in an amount of from 0.001 to 0.05 weight percent.'In another embodiment, compounds of the present invention may be used in an alcoholic solution in amounts of from 0.1 to 30 weight percent, more preferably between 5 and 20 weight percent. However, these values are given only by way of example, since the experienced perfumer may also achieve effects or may create novel accords with lower or higher concentrations, e.g., up to about 50 weight percent based on the fragrance composition.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may be employed into the fragrance application simply by directly mixing the fragrance composition with the fragrance application, or they may, in an earlier step, be entrapped with an entrapment material such as polymers, capsules, microcapsules and nanocapsules, liposomes, film formers, absorbents such as carbon or zeolites, cyclic oligosaccharides and mixtures thereof, or they may be chemically bonded to substrates, which are adapted to release the fragrance molecule upon application of an external stimulus such as light, enzyme, or the like, and then mixed with the application.<br>
Thus, the invention additionally provides a method of manufacturing a fragrance application and consumer products resulting therefrom. The method comprises the incorporation therein of a compound of formula 1 as a fragrance ingredient, either by directly admixing the compound to the application or by admixing a fragrance composition comprising a compound of formula 1, which may then be mixed to a fragrance application, using conventional techniques and methods. Through the addition of an olfactorily acceptable amount of a compound of the present invention, the odor notes of a fragrance application will be improved, enhanced or modified.<br>
Thus, the invention furthermore provides a method for improving, enhancing or modifying a fragrance application through the addition thereto of an olfactory acceptable amount of a compound of formula 1, or a mixture thereof.<br>
The invention also provides a fragrance application comprising:<br>
a)	as odorant a compound of formula 1 or a mixture thereof; and<br>
b)	a consumer product base.<br>
As used herein, "fragrance application" means any products, such as fine fragrances, e.g. eaux de perfume and eaux de toilette; household products, e.g. detergents for dishwasher, surface cleaner, air freshener; laundry products, e.g. softener, bleach, detergent; body care products, e.g. after-shave lotion, shampoo, shower gel, shower and bath salt, hygiene product; and cosmetics, e.g. deodorants, vanishing creams, comprising an odorant. This list of products is given by way of illustration and is not to be regarded as being in any way limiting.<br><br>
As used herein, "fragrance composition' means any composition comprising at least one odorant molecule and a diluent conventionally used in conjunction with odorants in fragrance compositions, such as dipropylenglycol (DPG), isopropylmyristate (IMP), triethylcitrate (TEC) and alcohol (e.g. ethanol).<br>
The compounds of the present invention may be prepared according to Scheme 1, starting from a-campholenic aldehyde of any enantiomer ratio (pure (R) or (S) or any mixture of both enantiomers) via the corresponding dihydroanalogue (2,2,3-trimethylcyclopentylacetaldehyde; 2), as described for example in EP 0 466 019. The latter may be condensed with an aldehyde or ketone to give the ^/^-unsaturated aldehyde or ketone 3. Reduction of 3 to the corresponding alcohols 4, followed by a cyclopropanation (e.g. using the Simmons-Smith reaction or the Yamamoto method) affords [2-[(2,2,3-trimethylcyclopentyl)methyl]cyclopropyl]methanols 1 as mixtures of stereoisomers. They may be separated or enriched in one or several stereoisomers by methodologies known in the art.<br>
Scheme 1:<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
a) R1CH2C(0)R2, base e.g. MeONa; b) NaBH4 or LiAIH4; c) CH2Br2, Zn, CuBr; or CH2l2, EtijAI. R1 and R2 have the same meaning as given for formula 1 hereinabove.<br><br>
The invention is now further described with reference to the following non-limiting examples. These examples are for the purpose of illustration only and it is understood that variations and modifications can be made by one skilled in the art.<br>
All products described in the Examples were obtained starting from commercially available qualities of o-campholenic aldehyde of approximately 9:1 or 2:3 (R/S) enantiomer ratios.
