				<td>Device at a card, in which a multiple number of working<br>
items are allocated to a roller as for example drum.<br>
The invention refers to a device at a card, in which in pre<br>
and/or post carding area a multiple number of working items,<br>
as for example fixed carding items,, suction equipment,<br>
eliminating knife, and the equivalent lying opposite to each<br>
other and - seen in circumferential direction of the roller<br>
adjacent to each other are assembled to a roller wherein out<br>
of at least two working items one module is formed.<br>
In a known device (DE 3855776A1) modules are provided with<br>
two and more working items and are fixed on card side<br>
frame. A cleaning device in shape of a suction unit is<br>
present before which a guide rod and after which a measuring<br>
rod are assembled. It is disadvantageous that this device<br>
does not make possible an influencing of the composition of<br>
eliminated foreign items (waste composition) and a removal<br>
of neps-<br>
The assignment therefore lies at the base of the invention,<br>
to procure a device of the type described at the outset,<br>
which avoids the mentioned disadvantages, which permits in<br>
particular a change or rather influencing of waste<br>
composition and the removal of neps.<br>
The solution of this assignment takes place through the<br>
distinguishing features of claim 1.<br>
Through the measures as per invention it turns out well, to<br>
improve considerably the elimination of troubling foreign<br>
materials and/or neps. A special advantage exists therein,<br><br>
that a multifunctional assembly of working items is made<br>
possible. Through it,, a flexible matching to fibre materials<br>
in order to meet high quality requirements in the materials<br>
under production, turns out well, in particular on ground of<br>
module design and the uniform angle stretching to reduce<br>
considerably time expenditure for the exchange of worn out<br>
working items at higher precision of the assembly of<br>
replaced items.<br>
The claims 2 to 17 H^tve in content advantageous further<br>
developments of invention.<br>
It show;<br>
Fig.1 Schematic side view of a card with the device as<br>
per invention<br>
Fig.2 an execution shape of device with two modules for<br>
elimination of foreign materials in pre carding<br>
area.<br>
Fig.3 an execution shape of device with two modules for<br>
elimination of neps in post card area.<br>
Fig.4 An execution shape of device with three modules<br>
for elimination of foreign materials and neps in<br>
the pre carding area and<br>
Fig.5 an execution shape of device with three modules<br>
for elimination of foreign materials and neps in<br>
the post carding area.<br>
Fig.l shows a card as for example Truetzschler high capacity<br>
card DK 903, with feed roller 1, feed table 2, licker in 3aÂ»<br>
3b, 3c, drum 4, doffing cylinder 5, stripping roller 6,<br>
squeeze roller 7, 8, non-woven fleece guide item 9, web<br><br>
trumpet 10, draw box 11,, 12, revolving flat 13, with flat<br>
rods 14, can 15, and can coiler 16. The direction of<br>
rotation of rollers are shown with bent arrows. With A the<br>
working direction is denoted. The device 17 as per invention<br>
can be assembled as for example at the locations B and/or C<br>
at the drum 4. At location B, as per Fig.2 - seen in<br>
direction of rotation 4a of the drum - in succession two<br>
modules B1, B2, with in each case a fixed carding item 18a,<br>
a suction hood 19a with eliminating knife 20 and eliminating<br>
opening 21 and a pressure item 17a with pressure bar 22 are<br>
present. Through the successively connected module B1, B2 an<br>
essential improvement of elimination of foreign bodies like<br>
trash, collection parts, leaf residuals end the equivalent<br>
are made possible. At location C corresponding to Fig.3 -<br>
seen in direction of rotation 4a of the drum 4<br>
successively two modules C1,( C2 with in each case a pressure<br>
item 17b, with pressure bar 22, a suction hood 19b with<br>
eliminating knife 20 and eliminating opening 21 and a fixed<br>
carding item 18b are assembled. Through the successive<br>
connection of modules CI, C2 a considerable improvement of<br>
the elimination of neps are realised. With 4b set of the<br>
drum is denoted. With 26 the cover 26 lying opposite to the<br>
set 4b is denoted.<br>
As per Figure 4 and 5 in the pre carding area B and in the<br>
post carding area C in each case three modules are present,<br>
from which in each case two modules B1, B3, CI, C3 of<br>
foreign body elimination and a module B2, C2 of nep<br>
eliminating serve. The positions provided with number are<br>
recorded with following working items :<br><br><br><br>
With 23 a suction hood is denoted- with 24 a neutral cover<br>
item is denoted. The modules B1, B2, B3f CI- C2r C3 are<br>
assembled on both extension bends 27a, 27b of the card. The<br>
extension bends 27a and 27b are fixed on each side of the<br>
card to a card side frame 25a or rather 25b.. The extension<br>
bends 27a and 27b are adjustable over at lest three<br>
adjusting screws 28a7| 28a2., 28a3 or rather 28b,, 28b2, 28b3.<br>
In this way the distance a (Fig.2, 3) between working items<br>
or rather modules and the set of the drum 4 is adjustable.<br><br>
