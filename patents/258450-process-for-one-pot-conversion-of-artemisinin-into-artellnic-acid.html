				<td>FIFLD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an improved process for one pot conversion of artemisinin into artelinic acid, which reduces the three step (three pots) conversion of artemisinin to artelinic acid in one step (one pot). Artelinic acid and sodium artelinate are customary names for p[(12-dihydroartemisininoxy)methyl] benzoate and sodium p-[12-dihydroartemisininoxy] methyl] benzoate, respectively.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Malaria is caused by protozoan parasites, notably Plasmodium falciparum. An approximately out of the 4 billion people suffering from malaria , 1-3 million , mostly children die every year worldwide. The range of drugs available for malaria is limited, and there are problems of drug resistance. Artemisinin and its derivatives: artemether and arteether (oil solubles), artelinate and artesunate (water sulables), a novel class of antimalarials derived from Artemisia annua are now proving their promising activity and are being used for the treatment of uncomplicated/severe complicated/cerebral and multi drug resistant malaria.The chemistry and the antiprotozoal action of these compounds is described in the following publications: Woerdenbag et al., Progress in the Research of Artemisinin Related Antimalarials: An Update, Pharm. World Sci. 16 (4), 169-180 (1994); Hien et al., Qinghaosu, The Lancet 341, 603-608. (1993); Butler et al ., Artemisinin (Qinghaosu): A New Type of Antimalarial Drug, Chem. Soc. Reviews, 85-90(1992); Zaman et al., Some Aspects of the Chemistry and Biological Activity of Artemisinin and Related Antimalarials, Heterocycles 32 (8), 1593-1638 (1991); Woerdenbag et al., Artimisia annua L.:A Source of Novel Antimalarial Drugs, Pharm. Weekblad Sci. 12(5), 169-181 (1990); Klayman, D.L., Qinghaosu (Artemisinin): An Antimalarial Drug from China, Science 228, 1049-1055 (1985). Tht,- water-insoluble artesunic acid and artelenic acid is customarily administered orally in the form of tablets or rectally in the form of suppositories, while the water-soluble artesunate and artelinate are administered intravenously. Although sodium salt of artesunic acid, the half succinic acid ester derivative of DMA was clinically evaluated in China as water soluble drug but its utility was impaired by poor stability in aqueous solution due to the easy hydrolysis of its ester linkage. . A new water soluble derivative was needed not only to overcome the instability problem in the aqueous solution but also of having much longer plasma half life than artemether, arteether and artesunate. The sodium artelinate is considered the best<br>
candidate drug amongst the available water soluble analogues of this class for the treatment of multi drug resistant and cerebral malaria .<br>
Lin etal., J. Med. Chem, 30, 2147-2150 (1987) prepared p-artelinic acid in three steps (three pots) (Chart-l) and and its sodium salts four steps (four pots), respectively. Artemisinin was converted into dihydroartemisinin( According to the method reported by Brossi et al) in the first step(1st Pot); In the second step (2nd pot) the dihydroartemisinin was stirred in ether with methyl-p(hydroxymethyl) benzoate in the presence of BF3.Et2O an acid catalyst for 24 hrs. The reaction mixture was washed with NaHCO3 and H2O, dried with Na2SO4 and evaporate to dryness to give oily product. The impure product was purified by column chromatography to yield methyl artelinate. In the third step (3rd pot) methyl artelinate was hydrolysed with 2.5 NaOH/MeOH solution for two days at room temp and after acidic workup (3 artelinic acid was obtained in 55% yield in the step (43.5% with respect to artemisinin). In the last step p artelinic acid was converted into water soluble sodium p-artelinate. Another three steps (three pots) (Chart-l) method for the preparation of a-artelinic aciJ was reported by Vishwakarma et al J. Nat. Product, 55, 114-1144(1992). In this method dihydroartemisinin was stirred with methyl-p(iodomethyl) benzoate in dry dichloromethane using freshly prepared Ag2O for 5 hrs at room temperature and yielded only a-epimer, methyl a artelinate. Hydrolysis and subsequent preparation of sodium salt of the acid, methyl a artelinate was done according to the method reported by lin et al.<br>
In another three pots method reported by Jain et al, US Patent No. 6346631, and Indian Patent No 185198, for the preparation of the (3 artelinic acid, in the second pot methyl artelinate was prepared by stirring dihydroartemisinin with methyl-p(hydroxymethyl) benzoate in the presence of a different acid catalyst chlorotrimethylsilane in dry benzene for 2-6 hrs. The reaction mixture was washed with sodium acetate, dried with sodium sulphate and evaporated to dryness to yield oily product which upon column chromatography yielded pure methyl artelinate. This methodology thus , starting from artemisinin yielded (3-artelinic acid (53%) (Chart-l) which was furthur converted into sodium artelinate.<br>
In another method reported by Bhakuni et al, a novel one pot conversion of artemisinin into arteether, US Patent No.6,750, 356, 15-6-2004 in which artemisinin was converted into arteether using a new catalyst, polyhydroxy compound (PHC)<br>
which  catalyses  the  reduction  of     artemisinin  into  dihydroartemisinin  at room<br>
temperature (20-30 degree C).<br>
Another method reported by Singh et a/, Tet.  Lett 43, 7235-7237(2002),<br>
artemisinin was converted into methyl artelinate in 49% yield in one step by stirring<br>
artemisinin first with sodium borohydride and catalyst, Amberlyst-15 in tetrahydrofuran<br>
followed by replacing tetrahydrofuran with dichloromethane and strring further the<br>
reaction mixture with  methyl (p-hydroxy methyl) benzoate at room temperature in 18<br>
hrs.<br>
The above methods for the preparation of artelinic acid carry some disadvantages as<br>
compared to the present invention are:<br>
(a) All the above methods except the last one (incomplete method) require at least three steps (three separate pots) to convert artemisinin into artelinic acid i.e 1st Pot: Conversion of artemisinin into dihydroartemisinin, 2nd Pot: Covnersion of dihydroartemisinin into methyl artelinate, 3rd Pot: Hydrolysis of methyl artelinate into artelinic acid.<br>
(b)	Consumes  more  chemicals  being  less  cost effective  and  more     time<br>
consuming.<br>
(c)	Reduces the yield of intermediates dihydroartemisinin and methyl artelinate and<br>
thus increase the production cost of artelinic acid and its salt.<br>
(d)	Further, the use of benzene is not acceptable according to the health standard<br>
as it is a carcinogenic solvent.<br>
(e)	The last prior art by Singh et al, Tet. Lett 43, 7235-7237(2002) which describes<br>
conversion of artemisinin into methyl artelinate in one pot in 49% yield is an<br>
incomplete  methodology to convert artemisinin  into artelinic acid.     Another<br>
disadvantage of this process is the use of two solvents tetrahydrofuran and<br>
dichloromethane in one pot. Thus, after completion of reduction of artemisinin into<br>
dihydroartemisinin the solvent, tetrahydrofuran was evaporated and replaced by<br>
second solvent dichloromethane makes the process expensive and time taking.<br>
(f)	All above processes uses column chromatography in the purification of methyl<br>
.artelinate / artelinic acid which is an extra chemical consuming, product yield<br>
lowering and time taking step.<br>
Our invention is able to overcome the shortcoming of the cited invention above being one pot conversion of artemisinin into artelinic acid around 98%yieid. References;<br>

Process of the present follows two methodologies:<br>
1.         First methodology: Use of column chromatography<br><br>
After completion of all three reactions, reduction, alkylation and hydrolysis followed by usual workup provides crude artelenic acid in about double of artemisinin which require column chromatography to produce lower yield of pure product. Though it is better than all the prior art processes but the drawback of this process is the unwanted and undissolved reaction products obtained in the reduction and alkylation processes which lead to get much complicated mixture of artelinic acid and require column chromatography to produce pure product.<br>
2. Second methodology: Filtration and removal of column chromatography<br>
Removal of unwanted and undissolved reaction products after reduction and akylation processes improve the hydrolysis of MAL in the filtrate and produce cleaner product which upon usual work up and recrystallization produce pure artelinic acid in very high yield (91 to 98%).<br>
Therefore, the novel process steps in the second methodology of filtration of unwanted reaction products and removal of column chromatography thereby leading to very high yield of pure product is the novelty of our present invention and are non-obvious.<br>
The following examples are given by the way of illustration and therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of the invention: EXAMPLES -USING FILTRATION STEP: EXAMPLE 1<br>

2nd-alkylation of dihydroartemisinin into methyl artelinate 3rd- hydrolysis of methyl artelenate into artelinic acid was carried out in one pot (Chart-l) thus, avoids the unwanted process of isolation of dihydroartemisinin and methyl artelinate which saves losses of the intermediates dihydroartemisinin and methyl artelinate, chemicals, labour and time.<br>
1. Conversion of artemisinin into impure artelinic acid in one pot takes place in about (5-9 hrs) and is a less time consuming method as compared to previously reported three pot conversion of artemisinin into dihydroartemisinin in first pot followed by isolation of dihydroartemisinin and its alkylation into methyl artelinate in the second pot, isolation of it and hydrolysis of methyl artelinate into artelinic acid in the third pot is a long time consuming process.<br>
2.	After completion of alkylation reaction, the process of filtration of undissolve,<br>
unwanted reaction products improves hydrolysis of methyl artelinate to produce<br>
artelicic acid in very high yield.<br>
3.	The process of purification of impure artelenic acid into pure product omits<br>
column chromatography step which is an extra chemical consuming, product<br>
yield lowering and time consuming process.<br>

temperature (20-30 degree C) and thereby avoids use of cooling unit as used in<br>
the conversion of artemisinin into dihydroartemesinin in the 1st step in the prior<br>
arts.<br>
6.	A process wherein the same solvent 1,4-dioxan/ tetrahydrofuran is used   in<br>
reduction, alkylation and hydrolysis steps and is cost effective.<br>
