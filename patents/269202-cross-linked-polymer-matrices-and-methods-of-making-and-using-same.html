INTRODUCTION<br>
Proteoglycans are constituents of the extracellular matrix (ECM) that may play key roles in a number of biological processes. These biomacromolecules may contribute to the functionality of extracellular networks. For example, proteoglycans may have roles in regulating the assembly of connective tissue matrices, in the binding of growth factors to either accentuate or inhibit this activity, and in the control of cell proliferation by direct or indirect interaction with tyrosine kinase receptors. These biological functions may be useful in creating biomaterial scaffolds. For example, a synthetic ECM that is bioactive and/or bioresponsive may have applications in drug delivery and tissue engineering.<br>
Naturally derived biopolymers often have useful biological properties but lack the structural or functional characteristics required for biomedical applications. For example, cartilage tissue covers the surface of bone in articulating joints and provides structural integrity for tissues such as the ear and nose.  Type II collagen and proteoglycans, including aggrecan, are the main components of the cartilage ECM and are responsible for the tissue's impressive compressive and tensile strength.<br>
Chondroitin sulfate (CS) is a biopolymer mat can form the "arms" of the aggrecan molecule, and forms a major component of cartilage ECM. Chondroitin sulfate may also have the ability to reduce pain and improve joint function in articular disease.<br>
Cross-linked polymeric biomaterials are used extensively in numerous biomedical applications including coatings for medical devices, structural artificial implants, and drug delivery vehicles. Polymer networks may be formed, for example, by crosslinking water soluble polymer solutions to form a water insoluble polymer network. Mechanical and structural properties may be manipulated by modification of the crosslinking density which controls network pore size, water content, and mechanical properties.<br>
Cross-linked polymers, matrices or gels may be used for tissue engineering due in part to their ability to efficiently encapsulate cells. In some cases, cross-linked polymers or gels may have a high, tissue-like water content which may allow nutrient and waste transport. A cross-linked polymer matrix that is biocompatible, or optionally, biodegradable, may be also be useful, for example, for detecting degeneration of cartilage in joints. Past work has shown that there may be a correlation between a gene mutation<br>
causing shortened G3 domain in aggrecan, and subsequent reduction in associated chondroitin sulfate, with a predisposition for intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration. Degeneration of the IVD is a significant clinical problem associated with low back pain and development of lumbar disc rupture. An effective therapy is needed that will replace IVD mechanical and structural function while promoting biological repair and regeneration.<br>

1.	Overview<br>
This disclosure is directed, at least in part, to cross-linked polymers, matrices, and gels, and methods of making and using cross-linked matrices, polymers and gels. Such cross-linked polymers may comprise a functionalized saccharide.<br>
For example, this disclosure provides for functionalized chondroitin sulfate. Functionalized chondroitin sulfate may form a cross-linked polymer matrix, which may be useful for, for example, cartilage reconstruction, for example, in a skeletal joint, and sealing or filling a wound. A cross-linked polymer matrix that includes a functionalized saccaride may also be useful for use in detecting the presence of cartilage degradation activity.<br>
2.	Definitions<br>
For convenience, before further description of the present disclosure, certain terms employed in the specification, examples and appended claims are collected here. These definitions should be read in light of the remainder of the disclosure and understood as by a person of skill in the art. Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by a person of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
The articles "a" and "an" are used herein to refer to one or to more than one (i.e., to at least one) of the grammatical object of the article. By way of example, "an element" means one element or more than one element.<br>
The terms "comprise" and "comprising" are used in the inclusive, open sense, meaning that additional elements may be included.<br>
The term "including" is used to mean "including but not limited to". "Including" and "including but not limited to" are used interchangeably.<br>
The term "articulation surface" refers to the surface of, and also to the disk of, cartilage between two bones in a joint. Reference herein to "articulating surface" refers to the well-known fact that, in a healthy joint, two cartilage-covered surfaces on two different bones will rub, slide, roll, or otherwise move while in contact with each other, as the joint is flexed or extended. This type of mobile interaction between two such surfaces is referred to as articulation, and the two cartilage-covered surfaces that contact and press against each other during such motion are said to "articulate". The disk of cartilage between two bones in a joint may be referred to as "articular cartilage".<br>
The terms "active agent," and "biologically active agent" are used interchangeably herein to refer a chemical or biological compound that induces a desired pharmacological, physiological effect, wherein the effect may be prophylactic or therapeutic. The terms also encompass pharmaceutically acceptable, pharmacologically active derivatives of those active agents specifically mentioned herein, including, but not limited to, salts, esters, amides, prodrugs, active metabolites, analogs, and the like. When the terms "active agent," "pharmacologically active agent" and "drug" are used, then, it is to be understood that applicants intend to include the active agent per se as well as pharmaceutically acceptable, pharmacologically active salts, esters, amides, prodrugs, metabolites, analogs, etc.<br>
The terms "biocompatihle polymer". ^iocomDatiblfi firafjSiliptkarM?P1-V'T"'r matrix"<br><br>
and "biocompatibility" when used in relation to polymers are ^"ffpojgj^^- F°r example, biocompatible polymers include polymers that are neither themselves toxic to the host (e.g., an animal or human), nor degrade (if the polymer degrades) at a rate that produces monomeric or ougomeric subunits orx3the£jp^pjpjh^.aLta^<br>
In certain embodiments of the present invention, biodegradation genjjrjdlvjflxpjy.es<br>
degradation of the polymer in an organism, e.g., into its monomeric subunits, which may be<br>
•»^.j.__.i_._	,_.		.._	«t.»-«         ^~,^p**'"'*i~ •'•r	" "•f""'""""«"'i|1 "•'"&gt;-•••j"'-**'*"--'-"**<br>
known to be effectively non-toxic. Intermediate oligomeric products resulting from such degradation may have different toxicological properties, however, or biodegradation may involve oxidation or other biochemical reactions mat generate molecules other than monomeric subunits of the polymer. Consequently, in certain embodiments, toxicology of a biodegradable polymer intended for in vivo use, such as implantation or injection into a patient, may be determined after one or more toxicity analyses. It is not necessary that any subject composition have a purity of 100% to be deemed biocompatible; indeed, it is only necessary that the subject compositions be biocompatible as set forth above. Hence, a subject composition may comprise polymers comprising 99%, 98%, 97%, 96%, 95%, 90%, 85%, 80%, 75% or even less of biocompatible polymers, e.g., including polymers and other materials and excipients described herein, and still be biocompatible.<br>
To determine whether a polymer or other material is biocompatible, it may be necessary to conduct a toxicity analysis. Such assays are well known in the art. One example of such an assay may be performed with live carcinoma cells, such as GT3TKB tumor cells, in the following manner: the sample is degraded in IM NaOH at 37 °C until complete degradation is observed. The solution is then neutralized with IM HCI. About 200 |j.L of various concentrations of the degraded sample products are placed in 96-well tissue<br>
culture plates and seeded with human gastric carcinoma cells (GT3TKB) at 104/welI density. The degraded sample products are incubated with the GT3TKB cells for 48 hours. The results of the assay may be plotted as % relative growth vs. concentration of degraded sample in the tissue-culture well. In addition, polymers, polymer matrices, and fonnulations of the present invention may also be evaluated by well-known in vivo tests, such as subcutaneous implantations in rats to confirm that they do not cause significant levels of irritation or inflammation at the subcutaneous implantation sites.<br>
The term "biodegradable" is art-recognized, and includes polymers, polymer matrices, gels, compositions and formulations, such as those described herein, that are intended to degrade during use. Biodegradable polymers and matrices typically differ from non-biodegradable polymers in that the former may be degraded during use. In certain embodiments, such use involves in vivo use, such as in vivo therapy, and in other certain embodiments, such use involves in vitro use. In general, degradation attributable to biodegradability involves the degradation of a biodegradable polymer into its component subunits, or digestion, e.g., by a biochemical process, of the polymer into smaller, non-polymeric subunits. In certain embodiments, two different types of biodegradation may generally be identified. For example, one type of biodegradation may involve cleavage of bonds (whether covalent or otherwise) in the polymer backbone. In such biodegradation, monomers and oligomers typically result, and even more typically, such biodegradation occurs by cleavage of a bond connecting one or more of subunits of a polymer. In contrast, another type of biodegradation may involve cleavage of a bond (whether covalent or otherwise) internal to side chain or that connects a side chain to the polymer backbone. For example, a therapeutic agent, biologically active agent, or other chemical moiety attached as a side chain to the polymer backbone may be released by biodegradation. In certain embodiments, one or the other or both generally types of biodegradation may occur during use of a polymer. As used herein, the term "biodegradation" encompasses both general types of biodegradation.<br>
The degradation rate of a biodegradable polymer often depends in part on a variety of factors, including the chemical identity of the linkage responsible for any degradation, the molecular weight, crystallinity, biostability, and degree of cross-linking of such polymer, the physical characteristics of the implant, shape and size, and the mode and location of administration. For example, the greater the molecular weight, the higher the degree of crystallinity, and/or the greater the biostability, the biodegradation of any<br>
biodegradable polymer is usually slower. The term "biodegradable" is intended to cover materials and processes also termed "bioerodible".<br>
In certain embodiments, the biodegradation rate of such polymer may be characterized by the presence of enzymes, for example a chondroitinase. In such circumstances, the biodegradation rate may depend on not only the chemical identity and physical characteristics of the polymer matrix, but also on the identity of any such enzyme.<br>
In certain embodiments, polymeric formulations of the present invention biodegrade within a period that is acceptable in the desired application. In certain embodiments, such as in vivo therapy, such degradation occurs in a period usually less than about five years, one year, six months, three months, one month, fifteen days, five days, three days, or even one day on exposure to a physiological solution with a pH between 6 and 8 having a temperature of between about 25 and 37 °C. In other embodiments, the polymer degrades in a period of between about one hour and several weeks, depending on the desired application. In some embodiments, the polymer or polymer matrix may include a detectable agent that is released upon degradation.<br>
The term "cartilage degradation activity" refers to an activity or the presence of a substance that may lead to the degradation of cartilage, for example, the activity or presence of degrading enzymes, or the presence of fibrillation, erosion or cracking on the cartilage.<br>
The term "cartilage forming cells" include cells that form or promote formation of cartilage. Such cells include chondrocytes and mesechymal stem cells.<br>
The term "cross-linked" herein refers to a composition containing intermolecular cross-links and optionally intramolecular cross-links, arising from the formation of covalent bonds. Covalent bonding between two cross-linkable components may be direct, in which case an atom in one component is directly bound to an atom in the other component, or it may be indirect, through a linking group. A cross-linked gel or polymer matrix may, in addition to covalent bonds, also include intermolecular and/or intramolecular noncovalent bonds such as hydrogen bonds and electrostatic (ionic) bonds. The term "cross-linkable" refers to a component or compound that is capable of undergoing reaction to form a cross-linked composition.<br>
"Electromagnetic radiation" as used in this specification includes, but is not limited to, radiation having the wavelength of 10"20 to 10 meters. Particular embodiments of electromagnetic radiation of the present invention employ the electromagnetic radiation of: gamma-radiation (10"2° to 10'13 m), x-ray radiation (10'u to 10"9 m), ultraviolet light (10<br>
nm to 400 nm), visible light (400 nm to 700 nm), infrared radiation (700 nm to 1.0 mm), and microwave radiation (1 mm to 30 cm).<br>
The term "functionalized" refers to a modification of an existing molecular segment to generate or introduce a new reactive functional group (e.g., acrylate group) that is capable of undergoing reaction with another functional group (e.g., a sulfhydryl group) to form a covalent bond. For example, carboxylic acid groups can be functionalized by reaction with an acyl halide, e.g., an acyl chloride, again using known procedures, to provide a new reactive functional group in the form of an anhydride.<br>
The term "gel" refers to a state of matter between liquid and solid, and is generally defined as a cross-linked polymer network swollen in a liquid medium. Typically, a gel is a two-phase colloidal dispersion containing both solid and liquid, wherein the amount of solid is greater than that in the two-phase colloidal dispersion referred to as a "sol. "As such, a "gel" has some of the properties of a liquid (i.e., the shape is resilient and deformable) and some of the properties of a solid (i.e., the shape is discrete enough to maintain three dimensions on a two dimensional surface.) "Gelation time," also referred to herein as "gel time," refers to the time it takes for a composition to become non-flowable under modest stress. This is generally exhibited as reaching a physical state in which the elastic modulus G1 equals or exceeds the viscous modulus G", i.e., when tan (delta) becomes 1 (as may be determined using conventional rheological techniques).<br>
The term "hjglrpgel" is used to refer to water-swellable polymeric matrices that can absorb a substantial amount of water to form elastic gels, wherein "matrices" are three-dimensional networks of macromolecules held together by covalent or noncovalent crosslinks. Upon placement in an aqueous environment, dry hydrogels swell to the extent allowed by the degree of cross-linking.<br>
The term "instructional material" or "instructions" includes a publication, a recording, a diagram, or any other medium of expression which can be used to communicate the usefulness of a subject composition described herein for a method of treatment or a method of making or using a subject composition. The instructional material may, for example, be affixed to a container which contains the composition or be shipped together with a container which contains the composition or be contained in a kit with the composition. Alternatively, the instructional material may be shipped separately from the container with the intention that the instructional material and the composition be used cooperatively by the recipient.<br>
The term "polymer" is used to refer to molecules composed of repeating monomer units, including homopolymers, block  eopelymers  random copolymers, and graft copolymers. "Polymers" also include linear polymers as well as branched polymers, with branched polymers including highly branched, dendritic, and star polymers.<br>
A "polymerizing initiator" refers to any substance or stimulus, that can initiate polymerization of monomers or macromers by free radical generation. Exemplary polymerizing initiators include electromagnetic radiation, heat, and chemical compounds.<br>
As used herein, the term "saccharide", refers to a mono-, di-, tri-, or higher order saccharide or oligosaccharide.

Methacrylation is also confirmed by I3C-NMR (Figure 3) with vinyl-carbon peaks (labeled with "C=") present at 8c=136 ppm and 128 ppm.<br>
The lack of spectrometric evidences for glyceryl spacers and the considerable stability of the glycidol leaving group, may confirm that the transterification reaction dominated via reversible cleaving of the electronegative glycidol in the first day of the reaction. From Day 3-15, the glyceryl methine protons at 5.51 ppm (labelled "h3") and 5.20 ppm ("h4") begin to emerge on H-NMR, with an intensity that increases with time. On the C-NMR spectrum at Day 15, the vinyl-carbon peaks are split into four; the original two peaks (Peak "C=") were enhanced, and two newly arisen peaks (marked with "C") are present at 121 ppm and 143 ppm respectively. These addition peaks also show the presence of the glyceryl spacer.  Moreover, the further evidence of ring-opening by 13C-NMR is the emergence of the peak at 63 ppm (marked with "C#") that represents the skeleton carbon on the glyceryl spacer. The glyceryl moieties originate from the ring-<br>
opening reaction on GMA's glycidyl residue. The two ring-opening products are indicated in Scheme 1 as the compounds (2) and (3).<br>
A quantitative analysis may be based an 'H-NMR data. The integral of vinyl-proton peaks "hi" and "h2", [hl]+[h2], are contributed by both transesterification product (1) and ring-opening products (2), (3). The ring-opening products (2) and (3) have their characteristic glyceryl methine peaks respectively at "h3" and "h4". Since the peaks "hl~4" are all representing single protons, the gross substitution efficiency may be calculated as ([hl]+[h2])/2, in which the contribution of ring-opening is ([h3]-t-[h4]), as shown in Figure 12. The transesterification may be a kinetically rapid and thermodynamically reversible procedure. Within 1 day or so, a reaction balance is reached, with a yield of about 50% gross substitution efficiency of the transesterification product. The ring-opening procedure may be kinetically slower, and therefore not substantially detectable after only 1 day. However, the ring-opening procedure is based on a thermodynamically irreversible mechanism. The reaction may proceed substantially linearly and may be independent of other procedures. At Day 5, contributions for gross methacrylation by the two reaction mechanisms becomes about equal. By day 15, the ring-opening mechanism may contribute to more than 80% of the substitution efficiency while products of the transesterification may bereduced to less than about 20%.<br>
Another reaction scheme for creating functionalized chondroitin sulfate is shown in Figure 13. An exemplary functionalized monomeric unit of chonroitin sulfate may be represented by:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Numerous chemical options are available for modifying polymers that may then undergo a radical polymerization For example, methacrylic anhydride, methacryloyl chloride, and glycidyl methacrylate may be used to add methacrylate groups to one or more monomers of a polymer chain. Glycidyl methacrylate may be used, for example, for<br>
efficiency of reaction. Further, the modification reagents may be chosen to optimize a lack of cytotoxie byproducts.<br>
In some embodiments, the number of polymerizing moieties per polymeric unit may be at least one moiety per about 10 monomeric units, or at least about 2 moieties per about 10 monomeric units. Alternatively, number of polymerizing moieties per polymeric unit may be at least one moiety per about 12 monomeric units, or per about 14 monomeric units. For example, there may be at least about one methacrylate group per ten chondroitin sulfate disaccharide units. In an embodiment, chondroitin sulfate may be functionalized with about 12% methacrylate groups.<br>
This disclosure also provides for a composition comprising a cross-linked polymer matrix, wherein said cross-linked polymer matrix comprises at least one monomeric unit of functionalized chrondoitin sulfate. In some embodiments, said cross-linked polymer matrix further comprises least one monomeric unit of a biocompatible polymer. In other embodiments, a cross-linked polymer matrix further comprises a compound comprising one or more amine groups, such as for example, a protein.<br>
Suitable polymers include biocompatible monomers with recurring units found in poly(phosphoesters), poly(lactides), poly(glycolides), poly(caprolactones), poly(anhydrides), poly(amides), poly(urethanes), poly(esteramides), poly(orthoesters), poly(dioxanones), poly(acetals), poly(ketals), poly(carbonates), poly(orthocarbonates), poly(phosphazenes), poly(hydroxybutyrates), poly(hydroxy-valerates), poly(alkylene oxalates), poly(alkylene succinates), poly(malic acids), poly(amino acids), poly(vinylpyrrolidone), poly(ethylene glycol), poly(hydroxycellulose), chitin, chitosan, and copolymers, terpolymers, or combinations or mixtures of the above materials.<br>
Other suitable synthetic polymers include polymers containing amine groups, such as chemically synthesized polypeptides. Such polypeptides may include polynucleophilic polypeptides that have been synthesized to incorporate amino acids containing primary amino groups for example, lysine and/or ammo acids containing thiol groups (such as cysteine). Further suitable synthetic polymers include poly(amino)acids.<br>
Other compounds that may include amine groups include proteins such as albumin. Albumin may be of mammalian origin, but other sources of albumin also may be employed. It is believed that most albumins are readily cross-linked according to the methods of the invention. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) may also be used. Alternatively, albumin may be recombinant albumin, isolated from cells expressing a recombinant albumin gene, using<br>
methods known in the art. Major fragments of albumin, comprising at least 100 residues of an albumin sequence, whether produced by partial proteolysis or by recombinant means, may also be used instead of intact albumin. Alternatively, useful fragments may contain at least 50 residues, and more preferably at least 75 residues of an albumin sequence. Finally,<br>
*<br>
mixtures of different forms of albumin (e.g., human, bovine, recombinant, fragmented), and plasma fractions rich in albumin may also be employed. Albumin may be purified directly from tissues or cells, using methods well known in the art.<br>
The polymer matrix of the invention can also comprise additional biocompatible monomeric units so long as they do not interfere the desirable characteristics of the invention. Such additional monomeric units may offer even greater flexibility in designing the precise profile desired for targeted drug delivery, or tissue engineering, or the precise rate of biodegradability or biocompatibility desired for other applications.<br>
In some embodiments, the cross-linked polymer matrix may comprise functionalized chrondoitin sulfate, with at least about 75%, at least about 50%, at least about 25%, or at least about 10% of said biocompatible polymer or a compound comprising an amine group, by weight. Alternatively, the cross-linked polymer matrix may comprise less than 25% said biocompatible polymer a compound comprising an amine group by weight.<br>
In another embodiment, a method of producing a composition comprising a cross-linked polymer matrix is provided. A method of producing a composition comprising a cross-linked polymer matrix may comprise providing a polymer comprising at least one monomeric unit of functionalized chondroitin sulfate and exposing said polymer to at least one polymerizing initiator, whereby producing said cross-linked matrix.<br>
Alternatively, a cross-linked polymer may be produced by providing a polymer comprising at least one monomeric unit of aldehyde functionalized chondroitin and providing a protein, such as, for example, a poly(amino)acid or albumin, such that the aldehyde functionalized chondroitin becomes cross-linked with, for example, the albumin. The reaction mechanism of such cross-linking may be a Schiff base reaction, as is known in the art.<br>
A polymerization reaction of the present invention can be conducted by conventional methods such as mass polymerization, solution (or homogeneous) polymerization, suspension polymerization, emulsion polymerization, radiation polymerization (using y-ray, electron beam or the like), or the like.<br>
Polymerizing initiators include electromechanical radiation. Initiation of polymerization may be accomplished by irradiation with light at a wavelength of between about 200 to about 700 nm, or above about 320 nm or higher, or even between about 514 run and about 365 nm. In some embodiments, the light intensity is about 10 m W/cm3.<br>
Examples of other initiators are organic solvent-soluble initiators such as benzoyl peroxide, azobisisobutyronitrile (ABN), di-tertiary butyl peroxide and the like, water soluble initiators such as ammonium persulfate (APS), potassium persulfate, sodium persulfate, sodium thiosulfate and the like, redox-type initiators which are combinations of such initiator and tetramethylethylene, Fe2+ salt, sodium hydrogen sulfite or like reducing agent, etc.<br>
Useful photoinitiators are those which can be used to initiate by free radical generation polymerization of monomers with minimal cytotoxicity. In some embodiments, the initiators may work in a short time frame, for example, minutes or seconds. Exemplary dyes for UV or visible light initiation include ethyl eosin 2,2-dimethoxy-2-phenyl acetophenone, 2-methoxy-2-phenylacetophenone, other acetophenone derivatives, and camphorquinone. In all cases, crosslinking and polymerization are initiated among macromers by a light-activated free-radical polymerization initiator such as 2,2-dimethoxy-2-phenylacetophenone or a combination of ethyl eosin (10"4 to 10"2 M) and triethanol amine (0.001 to 0.1 M), for example.<br>
Other photooxidizable and photoreducible dyes that may be used to initiate polymerization include acridine dyes, for example, acriblarine; thiazine dyes, for example, thionine; xanthine dyes, for example, rose bengal; and phenazine dyes, for example, methylene blue. These may be used with cocatalysts such as amines, for example, triethanolamine; sulphur compounds, for example, RSCh RI ; heterocycles, for example, imidazole; enolates; organometallics; and other compounds, such as N-phenyl glycine. Other initiators include camphorquinones and acetophenone derivatives.<br>
Thermal polymerization initiator systems may also be used. Such systems that are unstable at 37 °C. and would initiate free radical polymerization at physiological temperatures include, for example, potassium persulfate, with or without tetraamethyl ethylenediamine; benzoylperoxide, with or without triethanolamine; and ammonium persulfate with sodium bisulfite.<br>
Cross-linked polymer matrices of the present invention may include hydrogels. The water content of a hydrogel may provide information on the pore structure. Further, the<br>
water content may be a factor that influences, for example, the survival of encapsulated cells within the hydrogel. The amount of water that a hydrogel is able to absorb may be related to the cross-linking density and/or pore size. For example, the percentage of methacrylate groups on a fanctionalized chondroitin sulfate macromer may dictate the amount of water absorbable.<br>
For example, polyethylene oxide)-diacrylate (PEODA) may be used in a polymer system for cartilage tissue engineering, and cross-linked polymer matrices may include cogels of CS-MA (chrondroitin sulfate-methacrylate) and PEODA. The CS-MA hydrogels may absorb more water than the PEODA hydrogels, thus, increasing the percentage of CS-MA in the cogels increases the water content, as shown in Figure 4.<br>
The mechanical properties of a cross-linked polymer matrix, such as a hydrogel scaffold may also be related to the hydrogel pore structure. For applications in tissue engineering, scaffolds with different mechanical properties may be desirable depending on the desired clinical application. For example, scaffolds for cartilage tissue engineering in the articular joint must survive higher mechanical stresses than a cartilage tissue engineering system implanted subcutaneously for plastic surgery applications. Thus, hydrogels with mechanical properties that are easily manipulated may be desired.<br>
The dynamic frequency-sweep experiments disclosed herein show that hydrogels with various PEODA/CS-MA ratios were elasticity dominant and not sensitive to the shear frequency (Fig. 5a). The norm of the dynamic shear modulus |G*| increases with the shear frequency; however, such increase may be insignificant compared with the average value of |G*|. The phase angle 8 is narrowly ranged between about 1° and about 6° for all frequencies and all weight ratios. This may indicate that the rheological properties of PEODA and CS-MA are similar and the copolymerization does not alter these properties significantly. Cogels with higher portion of PEODA (100% and 75%) have a higher mechanical strength (indicated by |G*|) while the cogels with 50%, 25% and 0% PEODA exhibited a decrease of |G*| with the PEODA concentration (Fig 5b). The 100% and 75% samples had a |G*| value 3-4 times that of the CS-MA gel. This is consistent with the swelling experiments that demonstrated that the PEODA gels are more highly cross-linked than the CS-MA gel.<br>
Morphological analysis of the gels confirmed the CS-MA and PEODA hydrogel pore structure suggested by the swelling and mechanical analysis. As suggested by the swelling and mechanical data, the CS-MA gels exhibited a larger pore structure compared<br>
to the PEODA gels both on the surface and in the interior (Fig 6). The SEM morphological studies shown in Figures 6, 7, and 8 demonstrate a uniform pore structure, both on the surface and in the interior of the gels. The reproducibility (low standard deviation) of the swelling and mechanical data also suggests that chondroitin sulfate is substituted and forms hydrogels in a uniform and consistent manner.<br>
Chondroitinase ABC treatments for damaged cartilage tissue may promote coverage of defects by repair cells and functional integration at defect edges. For example, CS-MA gels that are incubated in buffer without chondroitinase ABC do degrade compared with the CS-MA gels incubated with enzyme that completely degraded within one day (Fig. 9a). There may also be a dose response relationship between degradation and enzyme concentration. Figure 9b demonstrates an increase in degraded disaccharide, as measured by absorbance, with increasing concentration of chondroitinase, with minimal degradation without the enzyme.<br>
Cytotoxicity of the biopolymer scaffold system may be evaluated with chondrocytes, the cells that comprise cartilage, by, for example, using a Live-Dead fluorescent cell assay and MTT, a compound that actively metabolizing cells convert from yellow to purple. Figure 1 la pictures a majority of viable cells that are also actively metabolizing MTT (Fig. 1 Ib).<br>

Members of the transforming growth factor (TGF) supergene family, which are multifunctional regulatory proteins, may be incorporated in a polymer matrix of the present<br>
invention. Members of the TGF supergene family include TGF-(3, the beta transforming growth factors (for example, TGF- p 1, TGF- p 2, TGF- P 3); bone morphogenetic proteins (for example, BMP-1, BMP-2, BMP-3, BMP-4, BMP-5, BMP-6, BMP-7, BMP-8, BMP-9); heparin-binding growth factors (for example, fibroblast growth factor (FGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), insulin-like growth factor (IGF)), Inhibins (for example, Inhibin A, Inhibin B), growth differentiating factors (for example, GDF-1); and Activins (for example, Activin A, Activin B, Activin AB). Growth factors can be isolated from native or natural sources, such as from mammalian cells, or can be prepared synthetically, such as by recombinant DNA techniques or by various chemical processes. In addition, analogs, fragments, or derivatives of these factors can be used, provided that they exhibit at least some of the biological activity of the native molecule. For example, analogs can be prepared by expression of genes altered by site-specific mutagenesis or other genetic engineering techniques.<br>
Various forms of the biologically active agents may be used. These include, without limitation, such forms as uncharged molecules, molecular complexes, salts, ethers, esters, amides, and the like, which are biologically activated when implanted, injected or otherwise placed into a subject.<br>
In certain embodiments, other materials may be incorporated into subject compositions in addition to one or more biologically active agents. For example, plasticizers and stabilizing agents known in the art may be incorporated in compositions of the present invention. In certain embodiments, additives such as plasticizers and stabilizing agents are selected for their biocompatibility.<br>
A composition of this invention may further contain one or more adjuvant substances, such as fillers, thickening agents or the like. In other embodiments, materials that serve as adjuvants may be associated with the composition. Such additional materials may affect the characteristics of the composition that results. For example, fillers, such as bovine serum albumin (BSA) or mouse serum albumin (MSA), may be associated with the polymer composition. In certain embodiments, the amount of filler may range from about 0.1 to about 50% or more by weight of the composition, or about 2.5, 5, 10, 25,40 percent. Incorporation of such fillers may affect the sustained release rate of any encapsulated substance. Other fillers known to those of skill in the art, such as carbohydrates, sugars, starches, saccharides, celluloses and polysaccharides, including mannitose and sucrose, may be used in certain embodiments in the present invention.<br>
Buffers, acids and bases may be incorporated in the compositions to adjust their pH. Agents to increase the diffusion distance of agents released from the composition may also be included.<br>
The charge, lipophilicity or hydrophilicity of any subject composition may be modified by employing an additive. For example, surfactants may be used to enhance miscibility of poorly miscible liquids. Examples of suitable surfactants include dextran, polysorbates, and sodium lauryl sulfate. In general, surfactants are used in low concentrations, generally less than about 5%.<br>
Biologically active agents may be incorporated into the cross-linked synthetic polymer composition by admixture. Alternatively, the agents may be incorporated into the cross-linked polymer matrix by binding these agents to the functional groups on the synthetic polymers. Such compositions may include linkages that can be easily biodegraded, for example as a result of enzymatic degradation, resulting in the release of the active agent into the target tissue, where it will exert its desired therapeutic effect.<br>
A simple method for incorporating biologically active agents containing nucleophilic groups into the cross-linked polymer composition involves mixing the active agent with a polyelectrophilic component prior to addition of the polynucleophilic component. By varying the relative molar amounts of the different components of the reactive composition, it is possible to alter the net charge of the resulting cross-linked polymer composition, in order to prepare a matrix for the delivery of a charged compound such as a protein or ionizable drug. As such, the delivery of charged proteins or drugs, which would normally diffuse rapidly out of a neutral carrier matrix, can be controlled.<br>
For example, if a molar excess of a component that is polynucleophilic is used, the resulting matrix may have a net positive charge and can be used to ionically bind and deliver negatively charged compounds. Examples of negatively charged compounds that can be delivered from these matrices include various drugs, cells, proteins, and polysaccharides.<br>
If a molar excess of a component that is polyelectrophilic is used, the resulting matrix has a net negative charge and can be used to ionically bind and deliver positively charged compounds. Examples of positively charged compounds that can be delivered from these matrices include various drugs, cells, proteins, and polysaccharides.<br>
The cross-linked polymer matrix compositions of the present invention can also be used to deliver various types of living cells or genes to a desired site of administration in<br>
order to form new tissue. The terra "genes" as used herein is intended to encompass genetic material from natural sources, synthetic nucleic acids, DNA, antisense-DNA and RNA.<br>
For example, mesenchymal stem cells can be delivered using polymer matrices to produce cells of the same type as the tissue into which they are delivered. Mesenchymal stem cells may not differentiated and therefore may differentiate to form various types of new cells due to the presence of an active agent or the effects (chemical, physical, etc.) of the local tissue environment. Examples of mesenchymal stem cells include osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and fibroblasts. For example, osteoblasts can be delivered to the site of a bone defect to produce new bone; chondrocytes can be delivered to the site of a cartilage defect to produce new cartilage; fibroblasts can be delivered to produce collagen wherever new connective tissue is needed; neurectodermal cells can be delivered to form new nerve tissue; epithelial cells can be delivered to form new epithelial tissues, such as liver, pancreas, etc.<br>
The cells or genes may be either allogeneic or xenogeneic in origin. For example, the compositions can be used to deliver cells or genes from other species that have been genetically modified. In some embodiments, the compositions of the invention may not easily be degraded in vivo, cells and genes entrapped within the cross-linked polymer matrix compositions will be isolated from the patient's own cells and, as such, will not provoke an immune response in the patient.<br>
In order to entrap the cells or genes within a cross-linked polymer matrix, the cells or genes may, for example be pre-mixed with a composition comprising functionalized chrondoitin sulfate, and optionally a further biocompatible polymer, and then a polymerizing agent is applied to the mixture to form a cross-linked polymer matrix, thereby entrapping the cells or genes within the matrix.<br>
Repair or Replacement of Damaged Tissue<br>
Plhe compositions disclosed herein may be used in any mjmber of tissue repair applications, such as, but not limited to, seroma and hematoma prevention, skin and muscle flap attachment, repair and prevention of endoleaks, aortic dissection repair, lung volume reduction, neural tube repair and the making of microvasuclar and neural anastomoses. Further, compositions of the invention may be used as an adhesive composition in the repair of damaged tissue.<br>
In one embodiment, the repair of damaged tissue may be carried out within the context of any standard surgical process allowing access to and repair of the tissue, including open surgery and laparoscopic techniques. Once the damaged tissue is accessed, a composition of the invention is placed in contact with the damaged tissue along with any surgically acceptable patch or implant, if needed. When used to repair lacerated or separated tissue, such as by joining two or more tissue surfaces, the composition may be applied to one or more of the tissue surfaces and then the surfaces are placed in contact with each other and adhesion occurs therebetween.<br>
When used to repair herniated tissue, a surgically acceptable patch can be attached to the area of tissue surrounding the herniated tissue so as to cover the herniated area, thereby reinforcing the damaged tissue and repairing the defect. When attaching the patch to the surrounding tissue, a composition of the invention may be applied to either the patch, to the surrounding tissue, or to the patch after the patch has been placed on the herniated tissue. Once the patch and tissue are brought into contact with each other, adhesion may occur therebetween.<br>
In an embodiment, substantially all reactive components of a composition of the invention are first mixed, then delivered to the desired tissue or surface before substantial cross-linking, for example by electromagnetic radiation, has occurred. The surface or tissue to which the composition has been applied may then contacted with the remaining surface, i.e. another tissue surface or implant surface, preferably immediately, to effect adhesion.<br>
The surfaces to be adhered may be held together manually, or using other appropriate means, while the cross-linking reaction is proceeding to completion. Cross-linking is may typically sufficiently complete for adhesion to occur within about 5 to 60 seconds after mixing the components of the adhesive composition. However, the time required for complete cross-linking to occur is dependent on a number of factors, including the type and molecular weight of each reactive component, the degree of functionalization, and the concentration of the components in the cross-linkable compositions (e.g., higher component concentrations result in faster cross-linking times).<br>
Thus, in one embodiment the compositions of the present invention are delivered to the site of administration using an apparatus that allows the components to be delivered separately. Such delivery systems may involve a multi-compartment spray device. Alternatively, the components can be delivered separately using any type of controllable extrusion system, or they can be delivered manually in the form of separate pastes, liquids<br>
or dry powders, and mixed together manually at the site of administration. Many devices that are adapted for delivery of multi-component tissue sealants/hemostatic agents are well known in the art and can also be used in the practice of the present invention.<br>
Yet another way of delivering the compositions of the present invention is to prepare the reactive components in inactive form as either a liquid or powder. Such compositions can then be activated after application to the tissue site, or immediately beforehand, by applying an activator. In one embodiment, the activator is a buffer solution having a pH that will activate the composition once mixed therewith. Still another way of delivering the compositions is to prepare preformed sheets, and apply the sheets as such to the site of administration. One of skill in the art can easily determine the appropriate administration protocol to use with any particular composition having a known gel strength and gelation time<br>
The compositions described herein can be used for medical conditions that require a coating or sealing layer to prevent the leakage of gases, liquid or solids. The method entails applying both components to the damaged tissue or organ to seal 1) vascular and or other tissues or organs to stop or minimize the flow of blood; 2) thoracic tissue to stop or minimize the leakage of air; 3) gastrointestinal tract or pancreatic tissue to stop or minimize the leakage of fecal or tissue contents; 4) bladder or ureters to stop or minimize the leakage of urine; 5) dura to stop or minimize the leakage of CSF; and 6) skin or serosal tissue to stop the leakage of serosal fluid. These compositions may also be used to adhere tissues together such as small vessels, nerves or dermal tissue. The material can be used 1) by applying it to the surface of one tissue and then a second tissue may be rapidly pressed against the first tissue or 2) by bringing the tissues in close juxtaposition and then applying the material. In addition, the compositions can be used to fill spaces in soft and hard tissues that are created by disease or surgery.<br>
For example, polymer matrix compositions of the invention can be used to block or fill various lumens and voids in the body of a mammalian subject. The compositions can also be used as biosealants to seal fissures or crevices within a tissue or structure (such as a vessel), or junctures between adjacent tissues or structures, to prevent leakage of blood or other biological fluids.<br>
The compositions can also be used as a large space-filling device for organ displacement in a body cavity during surgical or radiation procedures, for example, to protect the intestines during a planned course of radiation to the pelvis.<br>
The compositions of the invention can also be coated onto the interior surface of a physiological lumen, such as a blood vessel or Fallopian tube, thereby serving as a sealant to prevent restenosis of the lumen following medical treatment, such as, for example, balloon catheterization to remove arterial plaque deposits from the interior surface of a blood vessel, or removal of scar tissue or endometrial tissue from the interior of a Fallopian tube. A thin layer of the reaction mixture is preferably applied to the ulterior surface of the vessel (for example, via catheter) immediately following mixing of the first and second synthetic polymers. Because the compositions of the invention are not readily degradable in vivo, the potential for restenosis due to degradation of the coating is minimized.<br>
The compositions-of the invention can also be used for augmentation of soft or hard tissue within the body of a mammalian subject. Examples of soft tissue augmentation applications include sphincter (e.g., urinary, anal, esophageal) augmentation and the treatment of rhytids and scars. Examples of hard tissue augmentation applications include the repair and/or replacement of bone and/or cartilaginous tissue.<br>
The compositions of the invention may be used as a replacement material for synovial fluid in osteoarthritic joints. The compositions may reduce joint pain and improve joint function by restoring a soft gel network in the joint. The crosslinked polymer compositions can also be used as a replacement material for the nucleus pulposus of a damaged intervertebral disk. The nucleus pulposus of the damaged disk is first removed, and the reactive composition is then injected or otherwise introduced into the center of the disk. The composition may either be cross-linked prior to introduction into the disk, or allowed to cross-link in situ.<br>
In some embodiments, one, two, or more polymerizing agents may be used. For example, electromagnetic radiation may be used alone, or together with a photoinitiator. A photoinitiator alone may be used. Additionally or independently, a redox polymerizing agent may be used. The electromagnetic radiation, or a photoinitiator may trigger a fast polymerization. Such fast polymerization may ensure that the composition remains in the desired location. A redox polymerizing agent may be used simutaneously, before, or after electromagnetic radiation. A redox polymerizing agent may trigger a slow polymerization, for example, about 2 hours.<br>
In a general method for effecting augmentation of tissue or a disk within the body of a mammalian subject, the components of the reactive composition are injected,implanted, or infused simultaneously to a tissue or disk site in need of augmentation. The present<br>
invention may be prepared to include an appropriate vehicle for this injection, implantation, infusion.or direction. Once inside the patient's body, the functionalized chondroitin sulfate and, for example, a compound comprising an amine group may react with each other to form a crosslinked polymer network in situ. The functionalized chrondrotin sulfate may also react with primary amino groups on, forexample, lysine residues ofcollagen molecules within the patient's own tissue, providing for "biological anchoring" of the compositions with the host tissue.<br>
The polymer matrix, alternatively, may be formed as a solid object implantable in the anatomic area, or as a film or mesh that may be used to cover a segment of the area. A variety of techniques for implanting solid objects in relevant anatomic areas will be likewise familiar to practitioners of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
In some embodiments, compositions disclosed herein may be positioned in a surgically created defect that is to be reconstructed, and is to be left in this position after the reconstruction has been carried out. The present invention may be suitable for use with local tissue reconstructions, pedicle flap reconstructions or free flap reconstructions. Assays and Kits<br>
In some embodiments, this invention is directed to assays and kits for assessing effectiveness and diagnosis of cartilage degradation diseases such as arthritis. In some embodiments, the assay or kits detect the presence of enzymes that may degrade a cross-linked polymer matrix of this disclosure.<br>
Osteoarthritis, for example is a degenerative disease of the articulating cartilages of joints. In its early stages it may be largely non-inflammatory , and may be distinct from rheumatoid arthritis. Osteoarthritis may not be a single disease but may be indicative of joint failure that may result from various factors (e.g. genetic predisposition, mechanical overusage, joint malformation or a prior injury, etc.). Destruction of joint articular cartilage is the central progressive feature of Osteoarthritis. Other diseases in which joint cartilage may be destroyed include: rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, Reiter's syndrome, relapsing polychondritis, the low back pain syndrome, and other infectious forms of arthritis. In general, arthritis is associated with cartilage degrading activity.<br>
The assays, methods and kits disclosed herein may be used to detect early evidence of accelerated cartilage degradation in mildly symptomatic patients, to monitor disease progress in more advanced patients, and as a means of monitoring the effects of drugs or<br>
other therapies. In other embodiments, this invention contemplates a kit including subject compositions and cross-linked polymer matrices, and optionally instructions for their use. Uses for such kits include, for example, therapeutic applications. The invention further provides kits for use in treating a disease or condition. For example, the kit may comprise a subject functionalized chondroitin sulfate compound and a biocompatible polymer or an compound comprising an amine moiety, either already combined or provided separately.<br>
Test kits for use may include cross-linked matrix polymers comprising functionalized disaccharides that degrade in the presence of cartilage degrading enzymes, for example, chondroitinase and collagenase. Other proteases and enzymes may be detected using such kits.<br>
The invention now being generally described, it will be more readily understood by reference to the following examples which are included merely for purposes of illustration of certain aspects and embodiments of the present invention, and are not intended to limit the invention.<br>

Samples are collected at Days 1,3,5, 7, 10 and 15 by acetone precipitation and purified twice by acetone extraction. The GMA-CS products (Day 1, 3, 5, 7,10 and 15) are lyophilized for 24 hrs and stored at 4°C.<br>
Example 3: Synthesis of Aldehyde functionalized CS and Cross-linked Matrix.<br>
Six hundred nig of chondroitin sulfate Type A (0.8-1.2 mmol of adjacent diol, 70% CS-A, Sigma) and 616 mg of sodium periodate (~2.88 mmol, NaIC&gt;4, Sigma) are dissolved together in 10 ml of de-ionized water and protected from light. The reaction is allowed to continue for -14 hr in dark with vigorous stirring. The insoluble byproducts are removed with 0.22 urn filter and the product is loaded into a Sephedex G-25 (Sigma) size exclusion chromatography (SEC) column, by which the product was purified from the water-soluble byproducts and un-reacted small molecules. The product, chondroitin sulfate-aldehyde (CS-ald), is obtained by lyophilization with a yield rate of-90%. The determination of aldehyde substitution degree is performed via a hydroxylamine hydrochloride titration. The result is 60-70% substitution.<br>

Photocrosslinking is initiated with a cytocompatible UV photoinitiator Ingracure 2959 (0.05% w/w, Ciba Geigy) and 365 nm light at ~10mW/cm2 as measured by a radiometer. The macromers are photopolymerized for 30 min.<br>
The photocross-linked hydrogels are equilibrated in PBS at 37°C for 18 h. The water content of the hydrogels is determined by measuring the wet weight (Ww) of the constructs. Dry weight (Wd) of the hydrogels was measured after lyophilization for 24 h . The hydrogel equilibrated swelling ratio, q, is calculated by q» Ww /Wd.<br>
Example 6: Rheological Characterization<br>
PBS-equilibrated copolymerized CS-MA and poly(ethylene oxide)-diacrylate (PEODA) (3,400; Shearwater Polymers, Knoxville, TN) macromers (20% w/v) hydrogel constructs are prepared in tissue culture inserts as previously described. The constructs average!3.21±0.86 mm in diameter and 4.67±0.16mm in thickness as measured by current sensing micrometer. The weight percentage of PEODA and CS-MA in the constructs is varied from 0% (i.e., pure PEODA), 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% (i.e., pure CS-MA). Rheological tests are performed on a RFS-3 rheometer (Rheometric Scientific Inc.) using the parallel-plate configuration. The pilot dynamic shear strain-sweep test at a frequency 6.28 rad/s indicates a 0.1% shear strain that is in the linear stress-strain range for the samples with various concentration ratios, and such linearity is confirmed using the dynamic shear strain-sweep test for each test sample prior to the dynamic shear frequency-sweep test. The dynamic shear frequency-sweep is tested over a range of frequencies from 0.1 to 100 rad/s at a shear amplitude of 0.1%.<br>
Example 7: Morphological Analysis<br>
Hydrogel blocks synthesized from 20% (w/v) macromer solutions of CS-MA and PEODA were cut, frozen, and lyophilized. The surface and the cut edge of the hydrogels are analyzed on a LEO 1530 Field Emission scanning electron microscope (LEO Electron Microscopy Inc.).<br>
Example 8: Degradation Experiments<br>
Degradation of the polymerized hydrogels is carried out in pH 8.0 Tris-HCl buffered digestion solution (Tris-HCl 60 mM/L, sodium acetate 40 mM/L and bovine<br>
serum albumin 1.5x10-4 mg/L) at 37°C, 5% C02. Photopolymerized CS-MA hydrogels (20 % w/v) are weighed and placed in 24-well cell culture plate with 2.5 ml digestion buffer with or without chondroitinase ABC (0.8 mg/ml). At specified time points, the weight of constructs are measured. Chondroitinase ABC concentration is also varied (0.0025 g/ml, 0.025 g/ml, 0.25 g/ml and 2.5 g/ml) and at specified time points, the absorbance of digestion solutions is measured at 232 nm with a background subtraction at 600 nm in order to monitor disaccharide evolution as degradation proceeded (n=3). Values are normalized to hydrogel construct original weight. Figure 9 demonstrates the decrease in CS-MA gel weight over at 33 hours in the presence of chrondroitinase ABC. The gels are completely degraded by 33 hours in the presence of enzyme compared to control gels incubated without enzymes that maintain a constant weight throughout the experiment. Release of degraded chondroitin sulfate from the gels was measured in the buffer with varying concentrations of chrondoitinase enzyme. Increasing the enzyme concentration increases the concentration of degradation byproducts observed in the surrounding buffer.<br>
Example 9: Cell Encapsulation and Viability<br>
CS-MA and PEODA ar combined in a 1:1 ratio and dissolved in PBS with 100 U/ml penicillin G and 100 ug/ml streptomycin to from a 20% (w/v) solution. After addition of 0.05% Irgacure D-2959 (w/v), the macromer solutions are added to re-suspend the cell pellet to make a final concentration of 20xl06 cells/ml, and subsequently photopolymerized for 8 min with 10 mW/cm2 UV light. The constructs are then transferred and incubated in chondrocyte media high-glucose Dulbeccos modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 10 |j.g/ml vitamin C, 12.5 mM HEPES, 0.1 mM nonessential amino acids and 0.4 mM proline] at 37°C, 5% C02.<br>
MTT assay and live/dead staining assay are respectively performed to measure cell viability after 1 day in culture. For MTT assay, the constructs are washed twice with PBS and 2 mis of MTT solution (0.5 mg/ml in DMEM with 2% FBS) are added to each well for 2-4 h. Actively metabolizing cells are observed by light microscopy. Cell viability of the encapsulated cells is also evaluated with Live/Dead Viability/Cytotoxicity Kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, U.S.A.). Thin slices (100-200 um) of three layers are prepared with a surgical blade from the constructs. The slices are incubated for 30 minutes in Live/Dead assay reagents (2 uM calcein AM and 4 uM. Fluorescence microscopy is performed using a fluorescein optical filter (485 ± 10 nm) for calcein AM and a rhodamine optical filter (530 ± 12.5 nm) for Ethidium homodimer-1.<br>
Example 10: IVD applications<br>
A polymer composition with 80% CSMA with 0.1% (w/v) Irgacure D2959 photoinitiator or a polymer composition with 50% CSMA/10% PEODA with 0.1% (w/v) Irgacure D2959 is used. Gels photopolymerized in a IVD space in part A are removed and the swelling ratio is determined. A water-soluble redox initiating system is used with CSMA that includes 0.1% D2959 and 0.15 M sodium persulfate-0.12M sodium thiosulfate. The system is implanted in cadaveric IVD space. After photopolymerization the cadaveric spine is be placed in a 37 °C incubator to allow the redox polymerization. After gelation, the gel size and water content is determined. Results obtained in this model are expected to correlate with in vivo results.<br>
Example 11 Rabbit studies<br>
An IVD rabbit stab model is used to mimic the normal disc degeneration process. Animals are anesthetized with 50 mg/kg ketamine IM and 10 mg/kg xylazine IM and a stab wound is be created in the IVD disk space using an 18-gauge needle. Discs are allowed to degenerate for four weeks before polymer injection. The polymer formulation is injected into the disrupted disk space and polymerized. Control IVD disc spaces are injected with saline instead of polymer. Animals are monitored radiographically once a week to observe implant placement, disk height, and tissue degradation or inflammation. Animals are sacrificed after 4, 8 and 12 weeks and histological analysis is performed to observe polymer size and shape, inflammation, and surrounding tissue integration and repair.<br>
