Figs. 10 shows bulkhead according to an embodiment of this invention.<br>
Fig. 11 shows discharge pipe according to an embodiment of this invention.<br>
Fig. 12 shows cross sectional view of scroll around an evaporation fan motor assembly.<br>
Fig. 13 shows capillary unit comprises plurality of circuits according to an invention.<br>
Referring to figs. 1, 4 &amp; 7A, 7B, compressor (1), covered with thick soundproof jacket (3) is mounted on rubber grommets (2) made up of natural rubber, preferably neoprene rubber. The soundproof jacket (3), having thickness of 5 -15 mm, preferably 10mm is made up of natural rubber, preferably neoprene rubber, is used to reduce noise.<br>
Referring to figs. 2 &amp; 10, bulkhead (4) is covered with insulation jacket (5) having thickness of 15 - 25 mm, preferably 18 mm, comprises of two layers outer layer and inner layer, from which outer layer is made up of wool, preferably made up of natural wool having fire-retarded property, while inner layer is made up of adhesive type insulation; preferably PEFOP-AC SG (POLYURETHENE FOAM WITH ADHESIVE. AC) which has the property to reduce resonance effect of noise.<br><br>
Referring to fig. 1,2, 5A and 5B &amp; 6A and 6B, twin motor technology comprises of inturbo unit (18) and outturbo unit (19) wherein inturbo unit (18) comprises of an evaporation fan motor (7) and outturbo unit (19) comprises of a condensation fan motor (6). Both these motors comprise of conventional centrifugal fans for air movement wherein both motors are connected with separate shaft and thereby they run independently. Condensation fan motor (6) runs with the high speed only while evaporation fan motor (7) runs with three variant speeds like slow, medium or high. So even though evaporation fan motor (7) runs either with low or medium or high speed, condensation fan motor (6) runs only with the high speed. With this arrangement, condensation fan motor (6) passes hot air at high speed to the condensor unit (21) comprises of condensor coil (14), which helps the refrigerant within condensor unit (21) to remain within liquid form thus preserving the refrigerant from evaporation. At the same time evaporation fan motor (7), which runs with three variant speeds, converts liquid refrigerant into gaseous form, sucks cool air released from condensor unit (14) and sends cool air inside the room. Thus this technology helps to maintain the required temperature inside the room even though outside temperature is high.<br>
In twin turbo technology system, diameter as well as depth of both the fans is kept large which helps to increase flow of air and improve hydraulic efficiency and thereby reduces consumption of power and also reduces noise level. Both fans consist of comparatively less number of blades, which do not allow the dust and dirt to remain stick with blades. Instead larger fan passages allow dust to pass through. Thus by preventing the deposition of dirt and dust upon the blades, the noise reduces. Both fan motors assembly are mounted on rubber grommets<br><br>
(2) with the help of sleeve construction where sleeve construction means sheet metal (SM) plates (9) are applied between motor legs &amp; rubber grommets (2) to reduce vibration, which is transferred from motor stands to machine.<br>
Referring to fig. 4, 9 &amp; 11, tubing system (11) is covered with butyl sheet (13) at several places and mounted on rubber grommets (2). This tubing system (11) is kept comparatively long where the length of tubing system (11) varies from 800 cm to 1500 cm, depends on the capacity of compressor of air conditioner and proportional to size (tones) of compressor.<br>
The pressure of refrigerant that passes through tubing system (11) rises with increase in temperature of compressor (1). This tubing system (11) with loops (15) drops this pressure and thereby converts liquid refrigerant to vapour form before entering in compressor (1), so power consumption by compressor (1) reduces.<br>
The anti-clock movement of compressor (1) produces jerks when compressor (1) starts or stops. To absorb these jerks, suction pipe (12) is arranged perpendicular to compressor (1). This arrangement reduces the chances of breakage of suction pipe (12), made up of copper and thereby preserves life of tube.<br>
In the proposed air conditioner, as shown in fig. 13, single capillary (22) is used to carry refrigerant to circuits (23) which are small pathways of coolant. This single capillary (22) generates uniform flow of refrigerant into plurality of circuits<br><br>
(23) and thereby helps to reduce pulsation of refrigerant through the circuits and enhance life of circuits.<br>
Referring to fig. 1,2 &amp; 8, silencer plate (17), coated with zinc, is mounted on condenser fan motor (6) to reduce the pulsation of air thus reducing noise level.<br>
Referring to fig. 1,2, 4 &amp;12 scroll (20) is kept around an evaporation fan motor (7) assembly, which is designed with the help of computerized fluid dynamics. The scroll (20), made up of expanded polystyrene (EPS), is used to manage flow of air sucked by inturbo fan motor (6) from the room which is to be cooled and sent to the tubing system (15) for cooling as well as it releases cool air into the room. This directed distribution of air through the scroll (20) helps to reduce noise level by providing an obstacle to the flow of air.<br><br>
