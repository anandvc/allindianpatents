EMBROIDERY MACHINE<br>
The invention relates to an embroidery machine pertaining<br>
to the genre of multi-head embroidery machines according to<br>
the preamble of claim 1.<br>
The embroidery machines used industrially substantially<br>
comprise two types of machines, i.e. shuttle embroidery<br>
machines with horizontally moving needles for processing<br>
large-area, elongated pieces of material web and continuous<br>
material webs, and multi-head embroidery machines with<br>
vertically moving needles, these machines also being<br>
designated as gripper embroidery machines. They are used<br>
for processing cut material and for simultaneously<br>
embroidering a plurality of small single pieces of<br>
material.<br>
The fundamental structure of a multi-head embroidery<br>
machine can be deduced from DE 196 40 335 A1 . A machine<br>
frame has an elongated, horizontally running supporting<br>
beam for the arrangement of a plurality of embroidery heads<br>
and a lower supporting beam running parallel thereto at a<br>
distance for the arrangement of the associated gripper<br>
unit. The two supporting beams are fastened to two vertical<br>
support pillars located at the end. A supporting plate used<br>
to receive an embroidery frame is fastened to the lower<br>
supporting beam. The embroidery frame can be moved freely<br>
in two axes by a drive mechanism parallel to the plane of<br>
the supporting plate. This is used primarily for clamping<br>
the rectangular cut material to be embroidered or for<br>
receiving clamping devices for a plurality of single<br>
material pieces.<br>
The construction of a machine frame from two supporting<br>
beams held only at their two ends certainly allows a<br>
relatively simple design, but a machine frame constructed<br>
in such a manner tends in principle to exhibit resonance-<br><br>
- 2 -<br>
induced vibrations which are excited by vibrating or<br>
intermittently driven components and in this case in<br>
particular by the upward and downward moving needle bars of<br>
the embroidery heads. Such resonance-induced vibrations are<br>
all the stronger, the longer the portal support and the<br>
higher the speed at which the embroidery machine is<br>
operated. For this reason, limits are imposed on any<br>
increase in the number of embroidery heads and the related<br>
lengthening of the machine frame and also the increase in<br>
the machine speed.<br>
Numerous attempts have been made to reduce the tendency of<br>
embroidery machines to vibrate. For example, in the<br>
aforesaid DE 196 40 335 A1, measures were proposed to<br>
increase the bending resistance of the two supporting<br>
beams. Since the remaining parts of the machine frame are<br>
not influenced by this, the entire structure should not be<br>
made complex as a result. Another example is disclosed in<br>
Patent Abstracts of Japan 2000342876. An additional central<br>
fastening of the upper supporting beams is provided in a<br>
conventionally configured machine frame of a multi-head<br>
embroidery machine whereby vibrations should be reduced.<br>
In addition to increasing the performance of multi-head<br>
embroidery machines, it would also be desirable if their<br>
area of application could be extended such that longer cut<br>
material pieces or even continuous material webs could be<br>
embroidered. Appropriate attempts have also been made in<br>
this respect. For example, it has already been proposed to<br>
configure multi-head embroidery machines as disclosed in EP<br>
1 185 729 B1 so that one or more material webs are guided<br>
through the embroidery machine in their longitudinal<br>
direction transversely to the row of embroidery heads,<br>
where the materials webs are drawn off from a retaining and<br>
unwinding device for the raw material located in front of<br>
the embroidery machine and after embroidery, are wound onto<br>
a retaining and winding device for the finished goods<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
located after the embroidery machine. However, this type of<br>
material feed is only suitable for embroidery work where<br>
the pattern motif is repeated over the width of the<br>
material web as in quilting work. However, it would be<br>
inappropriate for embroidering pattern motifs which run<br>
along the edges of the material web such as borders and<br>
which are repeated in the longitudinal direction of the<br>
material web because in this case only some of the<br>
embroidery heads could be used.<br>
It is thus the object of the invention to provide a multi-<br>
head embroidery machine in which firstly the machine<br>
performance can be enhanced and secondly the possible<br>
application with regard to different embroidery work can be<br>
increased. The object is achieved by the characterising<br>
features of claim 1.<br>
Since the retaining frames which serve as supporting and<br>
bearing elements for the supporting beams and are embodied<br>
in the form of bridges do not lie in the vertical plane of<br>
the two supporting beams like the conventional supporting<br>
pillars but run transversely thereto, they need not be<br>
arranged at the ends of the supporting beams like said<br>
support pillars but can be connected to the supporting<br>
beams at any point. Since it is also possible to arrange<br>
the retaining frames at a distance from the ends of the<br>
supporting beams, a low-vibration machine frame can thus be<br>
provided with only two retaining frames connected to the<br>
supporting beams at suitable points, the length of the<br>
supporting beams being given and unchanged. In the same<br>
way, the machine frame can be additionally stiffened by<br>
adding further retaining frames so that either the tendency<br>
of the machine frame to vibrate can be reduced still,<br>
further or the possibility of increasing the speed of the<br>
machine is provided. Another possibility for increasing the<br>
machine performance consists in lengthening the supporting<br>
beams by using additional retaining frames in order to<br><br>
- 4 -<br>
provide the embroidery machine with further embroidery<br>
heads and consequently be able to process a larger<br>
embroidery field.<br>
As a result of the transverse alignment of the bridge-<br>
shaped retaining frames and their large inside width<br>
measured in the transverse direction, the machine frame has<br>
a free passage space running in the longitudinal direction.<br>
For the first time in multi-head embroidery machines, this<br>
makes it possible for continuous material webs to be moved<br>
through the machine and processed completely unhindered in<br>
the longitudinal direction. In comparison, if continuous<br>
material webs were to be processed in conventional multi-<br>
head embroidery machines, in which the upper and the lower<br>
supporting beams are fastened to two support pillars<br>
arranged at the ends, the support pillars would stand in<br>
the way of the feed and removal of the material webs to and<br>
from the embroidery frame and the expansion on both sides<br>
of the embroidery frame. This would then have the result;<br>
that the sections of the material web adjacent to the<br>
embroidery frame would be displaced horizontally through<br>
the support pillars with respect to the section of the<br>
material web clamped in the embroidery frame whereby<br>
folding and warpage would form in the transition region<br>
between these sections in the material web. This would<br>
result in numerous disturbances and complications in the<br>
work sequence whose intensity would increase<br>
disproportionately with increasing width of the material<br>
web.<br>
Since the mutually spaced retaining frames do not impede<br>
the transverse access to the embroidery frame support and<br>
the embroidery frame optionally inserted therein, the usual-<br>
embroidery work on cut material and single pieces of<br>
material can be carried out as before without impairment.<br>
In this way, single pieces of cut material., smaller single<br>
pieces of material or continuous material webs can bo<br><br>
- 5 -<br>
embroidered on the multi-head embroidery machine according<br>
to the invention using all the embroidery heads, where the<br>
embroidery pattern can extend over the entire width of the<br>
embroidered material or in particular in the case of<br>
material webs, can run only along the edges of the material<br>
web in the manner of borders.<br>
DE 42 39 746 C2 and DE 42 41 200 A1 certainly disclose<br>
solutions for reducing the overall height of the machine<br>
frame and for simplifying the base in the machine genre of<br>
the shuttle embroidery machines, whereby the machine frame<br>
has a U-shaped open cross-section and is constructed of<br>
modular units which can be arranged in rows in the<br>
longitudinal direction. Since the supporting beams for the<br>
needle bars and thread feeders on the one hand and the<br>
supporting beams for the shuttles on the other hand lie<br>
opposite one another with a horizontal spacing and<br>
therefore simple longitudinal structures running in the<br>
vertical plane, comprising side stands and longitudinal<br>
supports, can be formed for supporting these supporting<br>
beams, and a continuous channel running in the vertical<br>
plane is formed between them for receiving the material for<br>
embroidery which also extends in the vertical plane, these<br>
proposed solutions cannot provide any suggestion for<br>
creating a machine frame for multi-head embroidery machines<br>
in which the supporting beam for the embroidery heads and<br>
the supporting beam for the gripper units and the<br>
horizontal supporting plate for the embroidery frame<br>
support are arranged above one another with vertical.<br>
spacing.<br>
As a result of the further development of the retaining<br>
frame according to claim 2, a holder which is closed in<br>
itself in an annular shape and is therefore particularly<br>
dimensionally stable is provided for the supporting beams.<br><br>
- 6 -<br>
In conventional multi-head embroidery machines, the drive<br>
system for the embroidery heads and the gripper units<br>
comprises a common drive device where the necessary<br>
synchronisation of the embroidery head drive shaft with the<br>
gripper drive shaft is provided by means of a toothed belt<br>
which runs in a vertical plane. However, such a toothed<br>
belt would cross the plane of extension of a material web<br>
to be fed to the embroidery frame or being worked upon and<br>
thus hinder its free expansion. Claim 3 is therefore<br>
proposed to solve this problem, whereby the conventional<br>
mechanical synchronisation is replaced by control<br>
technology or electronic synchronization known per se.<br>
The invention is explained in detail with reference to an<br>
exemplary embodiment shown in the drawings. In the figures:<br>

- 7 -<br>
In the multi-head embroidery machine shown in Figures 1 and<br>
4, the machine frame 1 substantially consists of three<br>
retaining frames 2 which are arranged in the transverse<br>
direction A, are embodied in the form of bridges and are<br>
spaced apart from one another, as well as an upper<br>
supporting beam 3 and a lower supporting beam 4 which runs<br>
parallel thereto at a distance, both running in the<br>
longitudinal direction B.<br>
The retaining frames 2 consists of two vertical supports 5,<br>
an upper transverse support 6 and a lower transverse<br>
support 7 . Each of the upper transverse supports 6 has a<br>
downwardly directed intermediate piece 8. The upper<br>
supporting beam 3 is fastened to the lower end of the<br>
intermediate piece 8 so that this is at a distance from the<br>
underside of the upper transverse support 6. The lower<br>
supporting beam 4 on the other hand rests directly on the<br>
upper side of the lower transverse support 7 and is also<br>
firmly connected to said support. The inner sides of the<br>
vertical supports 5 facing one another have a mutual<br>
spacing which at the same time corresponds to the inside<br>
width C of the retaining frame 2.<br>
Fastened to the front side of the upper supporting beam 3<br>
is a fairly large number of embroidery heads 9 which<br>
comprise in a known manner thread feeders 10, needle bars<br>
11 each having a needle 12 and material pressing devices<br>
13. A drive device 14 is provided for driving these machine<br>
parts, comprising a motor 15 disposed on the upper<br>
supporting beam 3 according to Fig. 7, a central embroidery<br>
head drive shaft 16 running through all the embroidery<br>
heads 9 and a belt drive 17 connecting the motor 15 and the<br>
shaft 16 one to the other.<br>
A number of gripper units 18 corresponding to the number of<br>
embroidery heads 9 is fastened on the lower supporting beam<br>
4. The gripper units 18 each contain a gripper 19 (Fig. 7)<br><br>
- 8 -<br>
which cooperates with the needle 12 of the active needle<br>
bar 11 of the allocated embroidery head 9 to form sewing or<br>
embroidery stitches. A drive device 20 is used to drive the<br>
grippers 19, which according to Fig. 7 consists of a motor<br>
21 located on the lower supporting beam 4, a central<br>
gripper drive shaft 22 running through all the gripper<br>
units 18 and a belt drive 23 connecting the motor 21 and<br>
the shaft 22 one to the other.<br>
The motor 15 associated with the embroidery heads 9 is<br>
speed-controlled in a manner known per se under the control<br>
of the machine controller which is not shown. The motor 21<br>
used to drive the grippers 19 on the other hand is<br>
position-controlled in a likewise known manner, where the<br>
rotary rotation of the gripper drive shaft 22 is tracked to<br>
the rotary position of the embroidery head drive shaft 16.<br>
The information on the respective angular position of the<br>
two shafts 16, 22 required for this is communicated to the<br>
position controller by means of two rotary position sensors<br>
24, 25 arranged at the ends of the two shafts 16, 22.<br>
A supporting plate 26 is fastened on the lower supporting<br>
beam 4 and receives an embroidery frame support 27 capable<br>
of being moved in the longitudinal direction B and the<br>
transverse direction A. The embroidery frame support 27 is<br>
composed of two longitudinal spars 28 and two transverse<br>
spars 29. The longitudinal and transverse spars 28, 29 each<br>
consist of a central plate 30 and two inwardly directed<br>
guide strips 31 formed on their longitudinal sides.<br>
The feed system 32 for the embroidery frame support 27<br>
contains a plurality of U-shaped guide rails 33 which are<br>
fastened to the lower supporting beam 4 and run in the<br>
transverse direction A, and which are received in recesses<br>
of the supporting plate 26. For each of the two<br>
longitudinal spars 28, a carriage 34 is received in the<br>
guide rails 33 and is supported via a set: of guide rollers<br><br>
- 9 -<br>
35 on the walls of the respective guide rail 33. Fastened<br>
to each carriage 34 is a further set of guide rollers 36<br>
which protrudes above the upper side of the supporting<br>
plate 26 and according to Fig. 8 is received in one of the<br>
longitudinal spars 28 ar.d at the same time runs in its<br>
guide strips 31. Each carriage 34 is firmly connected to a<br>
toothed belt 37 which is guided via two rollers 38 located<br>
at the ends of the guide rail 33. The rear rollers 38 to be<br>
seen at the front in Fig. 8 are secured on a common shaft<br>
39 which for its part is connected via a belt drive 40 to a<br>
drive motor 41.<br>
At one end of the machine frame 1, two U-shaped guide rails<br>
43 running in the longitudinal direction B are fastened on<br>
a transverse support 42 located on the lower supporting<br>
beam 4. These guide rails 43 each receive a carriage 44<br>
which is supported on a set of guide rollers 45 on the<br>
walls of the respective guide rail 43. A further set of<br>
guide rollers 48 is affixed to each of the two carriages<br>
44, this being received in the associated transverse spar<br>
29 of the embroidery frame support 27 and at the same time<br>
running in its guide strips 31. The two carriages 44 are<br>
firmly connected to a tocthed belt 47 which is guided via<br>
two rollers 48 located at the ends of the guide rails 43.<br>
The outer rollers 48 are affixed to a common shaft 49 which<br>
for its part is connected via a belt drive 50 to a drive<br>
motor 51.<br>
The embroidery frame support 27 can be moved in the<br>
transverse direction A by means of the drive motor 41, the<br>
maximum scope for movement of the embroidery frame support<br>
27 and the inside width of the retaining frame 2 being<br>
matched to one another so that longitudinal spars 28 of the<br>
embroidery frame support 2" do not hit against the supports<br>
5. The drive motor 51 is used for moving the embroidery<br>
frame support 27 in the longitudinal direction B, where the<br>
maximum scope for movement of the embroidery frame support<br><br>
- 10 -<br>
27 corresponds to the centre-to-centre distance of two<br>
adjacent embroidery heads 9.<br>
A profile rail 52 extending over the entire length of these<br>
spars is affixed to the inner side of each of the<br>
longitudinal and transverse spars 28, 29. The profile rails<br>
52 consists of a base plate 53, a rear vertical web 54, two<br>
strips 55, 56 bent in opposite directions in a hook shape<br>
and a substantially horizontally protruding clamping strip<br>
57. The web 54 and the adjacent strip 55 form a channel 58<br>
which is open at the top and the two strips 55, 56 form a<br>
guide channel 59 which is also open at the top but tapers<br>
in the manner of a slit.<br>
If cut pieces of material 60 are to be embroidered in the<br>
manner conventionally used in multi-head embroidery<br>
machines, according to Figures 4 to 6, a plurality of<br>
embroidery frames 61 are inserted in the embroidery frame<br>
support 27, said frames consisting of an outer frame 62 and<br>
an inner frame 63 in a known manner. Retaining arms 64 are<br>
attached to the outer frame 62. Clamping screws 65 are<br>
located at the free end of the retaining arms 64, each<br>
bearing a shaped piece 66 which can be inserted in the<br>
guide channels 59 of the profile rails 52. By tightening<br>
the clamping screws 65, the embroidery frames 61 are<br>
clamped firmly in the embroidery frame support 27.<br>
The insertion of the embroidery frames 61 and the<br>
subsequent clamping of the cut pieces of material 60 into<br>
the embroidery frames 61 and later removal therefrom i.s<br>
carried out in the usual manner from the front longitudinal<br>
side of the machine. Since the retaining frames 2 have a<br>
relatively large mutual spacing as shown in Figures 1 and<br>
4, these present no hindrance for the operator when<br>
carrying out the aforesaid activities.<br><br>
- 11 -<br>
For the embroidery of material webs 67 as shown in Fig. 1,<br>
a retaining and unwinding device 68 for the raw material<br>
shown schematically is located on one side of the multi-<br>
head embroidery machine and a retaining and winding device<br>
69 for the finished material likewise only shown<br>
schematically is located on the opposite side of the multi-<br>
head embroidery machine. The section of the material web 67<br>
to be embroidered is drawn off by the operator from the<br>
retaining and unwinding device 68 and is pulled under the<br>
material pressing devices 13 of the embroidery heads 9<br>
through onto the embroidery frame support 27 and the<br>
profile rails 52 located around this. The section of the<br>
material web 67 to be embroidered is now clamped firmly on<br>
the profile rails 52 with the aid of a plurality of spring<br>
clasps 70 shown in Figs. 2 and 3. These spring clasps 70<br>
consist of a flat, horizontal central part 71, a<br>
substantially vertically downwardly bent rear arm 72, an<br>
inwardly bent front arm 73 and a handle 74 affixed to the<br>
central part 71.<br>
The section of the material web 67 to be embroidered is<br>
clamped around on the profile rails 52 of the longitudinal<br>
and transverse spars 28, 29, whereby the relevant section<br>
of the material web 67 is initially clamped between the<br>
inwardly bent arm 73 of one spring clasp 70 and the<br>
substantially horizontally protruding clamping strip 57 of<br>
the associated profile rail 52 and then between the<br>
downwardly projecting arm 72 and the rear strip 55. In this<br>
case, the embroidery frame support 27 with the profile<br>
rails 52 thus fulfils the function of an embroidery frame<br>
which directly receives the material web 67 .<br>
Since the material frame 1 has a free passage space running<br>
in the longitudinal direction 3 as a result, of the inside<br>
width C of the retaining frame, the operator can place the<br>
material web 67 on the embroidery frame support; 27<br>
completely unhindered and firmly clamp the section of the<br><br>
- 12 -<br>
material web 67 to be embroidered on the profile rails 52<br>
of the embroidery frame support 27 free from offset. In<br>
this way, continuous material webs 67 can be embroidered<br>
without any restriction on the multi-head embroidery<br>
machine according to the invention using all the embroidery<br>
heads 9, in which case the embroidery pattern can extend as<br>
