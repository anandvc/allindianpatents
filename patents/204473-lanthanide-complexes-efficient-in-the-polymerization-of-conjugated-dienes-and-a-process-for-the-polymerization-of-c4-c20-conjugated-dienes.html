The present invention relates to catalytic complexes based on Lanthanides, their preparation and use in the (co)polymerization of conjugated dienes.<br>
Catalytic systems based on lanthanides, particularly neodymium, are known in literature, for the polymerization of conjugated diolefins to give poly-diolefins with a high content of cis (&gt;96%) -<br>
In most cases, the above catalytic systems are three- component systems, of which the first component consists of a lanthanide compound (carboxylate, alco-holate); a second component consists of an organometal-lic compound of magnesium or aluminum; the third component consists of a chlorine donor.<br>
Interesting examples of three-component catalytic systems, having a high activity and easy industrial preparation, are cited in EP-A-201.9 62, EP-A-2 01.9 79 and EP-A-207.559, in which t-butylchloride is used as<br><br>
halogenating agent.<br>
In the known art, binary catalytic systems are also described, obtained from the combination of lanthanide salts (for example NdCl3*3D wherein D is an electron donor, for example alcohol, ether, amine) with aluminum trialkyl, for example triisobutylalu-minum.<br>
Examples of the above binary catalytic systems are cited in  US-A-4.575,538,  JP-A-8361107  and JP-A-84113003.<br>
Catalysts which are much more active than the previous ones with respect to the polymerization of diolefins to give 1,4-cis polymers, have been obtained using as neodymium compound, an allyl derivative of this element.<br>
Recent scientific publications describe various catalytic systems consisting of the combination of a derivative of neodymium or praseodymium with compounds of aluminum comprising A1R3, A1R2C1, MAO. Nd(allyl)3, Nd(allyl)2C1, CpNd(allyl)2, LiNd(allyl)4 were used as allyl compounds of neodymium (see for example R, Taube et al., Macromol- Symp. 89, 193, 1995; J. Organomet. Chem. 513, 37,1996).<br>
According to these works, the most active catalyst proves to be that obtained from MAO and Nd(allyl) 2C1.<br><br>
These works also describe a method for the synthesis of Nd(allyl)2cl which is obtained by reaction between neodymium triallyl and neodymium trichloride.<br>
Nd(allyl)3 is in turn obtained by reaction between LiNd(allyl)4 and B(C2H5)3 in dioxane.<br>
As a result the Neodymium compound Nd(allyl)2Cl proves to be difficult to prepare; this greatly limits interest in its use as a possible industrial catalyst.<br>
The necessity has therefore been felt for complexes of Neodymium having at least the same catalytic activity as Nd(allyl)2Cl, but obtained with simple processes.<br>
It has now been found that particular complexes of Lanthanides, particularly neodymium, which are just as efficient as Nd(allyl) 2C1, can be prepared according to a much simpler process.<br>
In accordance with this, the present invention relates to complexes of Lanthanides effective in the polymerization of conjugated dienes, obtained by reacting LnX3 with at least one Lithium compound selected from:<br>
(i) Li(A), the molar ratio Li(A)/LnX3 being from 1.5 to 2.5, preferably from 1.8 to 2.2, even more preferably<br><br>
(ii) LiLn(A)4, the molar ratio between LiLn(A)4 and LnX3 being from 0.5 to 1.5, preferably from 0.8 to 1.2, even more preferably 1/1;<br>
wherein Ln is selected from any of the Lanthani-des, and is preferably neodymium;<br>
X is selected from halides, carboxylates, alcohol-ates, -N(RJ (R,) wherein RY and R . the same or differ-<br>
A     y	A        y<br>
ent, are C^-Cg alkyl radicals, X is preferably selected from halides and is even more preferably CI;<br>
A is an allyl radical having the general formula<br><br>
There is reason to believe, but there is no experimental evidence to confirm this, that in both cases the reaction product prevalently consists of Ln(A)2X, possibly complexed with LiX.<br><br>
The Lithium allyl is preferably prepared in situ, for example by reaction between Li butyl and Tin tetra-allyl.<br>
As far as Lithium neopentylallyl and lithium neopentylmethallyl are concerned, these can be obtained by reaction between a Lithium alkyl, for example Lithium ter-butyl and butadiene and isoprene respectively (see J. Organomet. Chem. 1972, 44, pages 39-56).<br>
Lithium neopentylallyl and Lithium neopentylmethallyl are preferable to Lithium allyl. In fact they are easier to prepare and give (for example by reaction with NdCl3) more soluble products which consequently react more easily with the cocatalyst.<br>
The Lanthanide complex of the present invention can be obtained by simple mixing of the reagents, preferably at temperatures ranging from +20°C to -90"C, even more preferably from -15°C to -50°C. It is preferable to use solutions of the above reagents in the presence of solvents, such as THF and aliphatic ethers, alone or mixed with hydrocarbon solvents.<br>
When solvents are used, the Lanthanide complex is dissolved or dispersed in the above solvents.<br>
The Lanthanide complex thus obtained can be separated from the solvent and used directly in the polymerization phase, or again diluted and/or dispersed<br><br>
in a suitable solvent/diluent, preferably an aromatic solvent, even more preferably toluene,<br>
A further object of the present invention relates to a process for the homo and copolymerization of C4-C20 conjugated dienes, particularly 1,3-butadiene and isoprene, characterized in that the polymerization is carried out in the presence of a catalytic system comprising the product obtained by reacting LnX3 with at least one Lithium compound selected from: (i) Li(A), the molar ratio Li(A)/LnX3 being from 1.5 to 2.5, preferably from 1.8 to 2.2, even more preferably 2/1;<br>
(ii) LiLn(A)4, the molar ratio between LiLn(A)4 and LnX3 being from 0.5 to 1.5, preferably from 0.8 to 1.2, even more preferably 1/1;<br>
wherein Ln is selected from any of the Lanthani-des, and is preferably neodymium;<br>
X is selected from halides, carboxylates, alcoho-lates, -N(RJ (RJ wherein Rv and R , the same or differ-<br>
Ay	A	y<br>
ent, are C^-Cj alkyl radicals, X is preferably selected from halides and is even more preferably CI;<br>
A is an allyl radical having the general formula<br><br><br>
alkyl radicals, preferably from H and C^-C^ alkyl radicals, and A is preferably selected from allyl, neopentylallyl, neopentylmethallyl.<br>
Typical examples of conjugated dienes which can be used in the (co)polymerization of the present invention are, in addition to 1,3-butadiene and isoprene, pipery-lene, 1,3-hexadiene, 2-methyl-l,3-pentadiene, 3-methyl-1, 3-pentadiene.<br>
As well as the conjugated diene, smaller quantities of C2-C5  olefins can also be present.<br>
The polydienes which can be obtained with the process of the present invention are characterized by a content of cis &gt;90%, usually &gt;96%.<br>
In the (co)polymerization of conjugated dienes, the catalytic system also comprises, in addition to the Lanthanide complex, another component (which we will call cocatalyst) selected from (a) Aluminum alkyls having the general formula A1XSR3.S wherein s is zero or an integer from 1 to 2, (b) aluminoxanes and (c) compounds having the general formula (I) (Ra)xNH4.xB(Rd)4, or (II) (Ra) 3PHB (Rd) 4, or (III) B(Rd)3, which by reaction with the Lanthanide complex are capable of generating catalytic systems of an ionic nature. In the above compounds having general formula (I), (II) or (III), the Ra groups, the same or differ-<br><br>
ent, are monofunctional alkyl or aryl radicals, whereas Rd, the same or different, are monofunctional aryl radicals, preferably partially or totally fluorinated, even more preferably totally fluorinated. The molar ratio between the compound having general formula (I) , (II) or (III) and the Lanthanide complex can vary from 0.1 to 10, preferably from 0.5 to 3, even more preferably from 0.7 to 2.<br>
With respect to aluminoxanes, these are compounds of aluminum having general formula (IV)<br>
(Re)2-Al-0-[-Al(Re)-0-]p-Al(Re)2 (IV) , wherein the various Re, the same or different, are selected from C^-C6 alkyl radicals, C6-Cls aryl radicals or H, "p" is zero or an integer from 2 to 50, preferably from 10 to 35. The various Re are preferably the same and are selected from methyl, isobutyl, phenyl or benzyl, preferably methyl (MAO = Methyl alumino-oxane).<br>
If the various Re are different, they are preferably methyl and hydrogen or alternatively methyl and isobutyl, the hydrogen or isobutyl preferably being present, as a number of Re radicals, in 0.01 to 40% by weight.<br>
The aluminoxanes can be prepared according to various methods known to experts in the field. One of the methods comprises, for example, the reaction of an<br><br>
aluminum-hydrocarbyl and/or aluminum-hydridoaluminum compound with water (gaseous, solid, liquid or bound, for example crystallization water) in an inert solvent, for example toluene. For the preparation of an alumino-xane having different Re alkyl groups, two different aluminumtrialkyls (A1R3 + A1R'3) are reacted with water (see S. Pasynkiewicz, Polyhedron 9 (1990) 429-430 and EP-A-302 424).<br>
The exact structure of the aluminoxane is not known.<br>
The catalytic system of the present invention (Lanthanide complex and cocatalyst) can be prepared by putting the catalyst and cocatalyst in contact with each other, in the presence of or without the monomer to be polymerized, inside or outside the reactor.<br>
The quantities of catalyst and cocatalyst are not particularly limited. For example, in the case of polymerization in a solvent, the quantity of catalyst is preferably within the range of 10"7" to 102 mmoles/li-tre, even more preferably 10"4 to 1 mmole/litre, in terms of Lanthanide. When A1X R-, c or aluminoxanes (particularly MAO) are used as cocatalyst, the molar ratio between the Aluminum and Lanthanide is preferably greater than 10 and less than 10,000.<br>
The catalyst and cocatalyst can be introduced<br><br>
separately into the reaction reactor or after previous contact with each other. In the latter case the contact can be carried out in the presence of a monomer which is then to be polymerized, effecting a so-called "preliminary polymerization".<br>
The polymerization can be carried out in solution using an aliphatic, cycloaliphatic or aromatic inert hydrocarbon solvent. For obvious economic reasons, an aliphatic hydrocarbon is preferred, preferably hexane.<br>
The polymerization can also be carried out using, as solvent, the same diolefin to be polymerized, according to the so-called "bulk process".<br>
The temperature range of the polymerization is from -70°C to + 100°C, preferably from -20°C to + 80°C. As far as the pressure is concerned, this is preferably the pressure of the components of the mixture to be polymerized.<br>
The following examples provide a better understanding of the present invention. EXAMPLES<br>
