Polyester and polvamide compositions of low residual aldehyde content<br>
A mixture of a polyester, such as poly(ethylene terephthalate) PET, or a polyamide, and a suitable compound selected from the group consisting of the hydroxylamine, substituted hydroxylamine, nitrone and amine oxide stabilizers, when extrusion compounded exhibits a lower residual aldehyde content than does polyester or polyamide alone when similarly treated. The invention pertains to any polyester or polyamide used in the manufacture of fibers, films or molded articles. For instance bottles or containers which are used to store consumer materials, for example food, beverages and water.<br>
Acetaldehyde is known as a decomposition product of polyesters such as PET. The acetal-dehyde imparts an undesirable taste or flavor to bottled water stored in PET bottles. It has been a long sought objective of the industry to reduce the level of acetaldehyde which mi¬grates out of the PET bottle walls into the water or other beverage stored therein. A number of engineering or design changes to extruders, injection molding machines for preforms and bottle making machinery have been made to minimize formation of acetaldehyde when poly-(ethylene terephthalate) PET is processed. Modification to the PET composition itself have been made to lower its melting point or its melt viscosity in order to allow less severe thermal or mechanical damage when PET is processed into preforms or bottles.<br>
Aldehydes may be formed in polyamides, for instance polyamide 6 and polyamide 6,6, under conditions of thermal stress. These aldehydes initiate a chain of events that lead to unwan¬ted yellowing and a reduction in mechanical properties.<br>
U.S. 4,361,681 teachesrthat polyester containing anhydride end-cap agents have a reduced acetaldehyde generation rate.<br>
U.S. 5,459,224 discloses polyesters having 4-oxybenzylidene end-cap agents to impart im¬proved weatherability and photostability, but no mention is made as to evolution of acetalde¬hyde. However, it is indicated that such polyesters are suitable for food and beverage pack¬aging.<br>
Polyesters can be synthesized by a number of routes known in the art using a variety of catalyst systems. EP-A-0 826 713 teaches that lower levels of acetaldehyde occur during<br><br>
copolymerlzation of PET when a phosphite such as bis(2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl)pentaerythritol phosphite is present during the polymerization.<br>
U.S. 4,837,115; U.S. 5,258,233; U.S. 5,266,413; U.S. 5,340,884; U.S. 5,648,032; U.S. 5,650,469; WO-A-93/20147; WO-A-93/23474; WO-A-98/07786 and WO-A-98/39388 teach the use of polyamides as a means of reducing the concentration of acetaldehyde, presumab¬ly via a Schiff-base reaction with the aldehyde, which is reversible in the presence of water.<br>
EP-A-0 191 701 describes biaxially oriented containers having excellent barrier properties said container comprising a blend of a poly(ethylene terephthalate) resin and an ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer resin. This reference is focused on improved gas barrier properties and is silent as to any reduction of acetaldehyde content.<br>
Japanese Sho 62-257959 describes biaxially stretched vessels built of synthetic resin con¬sisting of poly(ethylene terephthalate) blended with a copolymer of a polyamide, or blended with ethylene-vinyl alcohol at a weight fraction of 0.1 to 15 percent. The examples are limited to a single EVOH polymer (EVELG110, Kuraray Co.). It is taught that a lower level of acetal¬dehyde occurs when the EVOH polymer is present.<br>
EP-A-0 714 832 teaches a method of manufacturing a container comprising poly(ethylene terephthalate), polycarbonate or PEN polyester with an additive in the bottle wall which binds acetaldehyde. The additive is generally described as a polyamide.<br>
U.S. 5,656,221 describes a process of producing polyester with reduced acetaldehyde con¬centration using certain catalysts or inert gas conditions or by adding an amide compound. These include commercial polyamides or long chain aliphatic amide compounds.<br>
U.S. 5,856,385 teaches the use of polyamide or amide-wax to reduce the level of acetalde¬hyde which occurs when sorbitol-based clarifying agent is heated in polyolefins.<br>
U.S. 4,873,279 discloses a composition comprising a copolyester-carbonate resin, a poly¬ester resin, and a minor amount of a mixture of a polyol and at least one epoxide.<br><br>
U.S. 4,394,470 discloses a poly(ethylene terephthalate) molding composition with a caramel colorant. The caramel colorant may have been formed in situ from a mono- or disaccharide.<br>
U.S. 5,681,879 discloses a flame-retardant polyester composition comprising a polyester resin, a polyhydric alcohol having not less than 3 hydroxy! groups, an inorganic flame retar-dant and a halogen-based flame retardant.<br>
WO-A-00/66659 discloses molding compositions comprising PET and polyhydric alcohol additives for the reduction of acetaldehyde formation.<br>
WO-A-01/00724 discloses the use of polyols towards reducing acetaldehyde formation in ex¬truded products of PET.<br>
Hydroxylamine derivatives, such as N,N,-dialkylhydroxylamines and N,N-dibenzylhydroxyl-amine, are well known as useful stabilizers for a variety of polymeric substrates as is taught for example in U.S. 4,590,231; U.S. 4,668,721; U.S. 4,782,105 or U.S. 4,876,300, the rele¬vant parts of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
U.S. 4,649,221; U.S. 4,691,015 and U.S. 4,703,073 teach the use of polyhydroxylamine compounds, hydroxylamines derived from hindered amines and alkylated N,N-dibenzyl-hydroxylamine derivatives, respectively, towards stabilizing polyolefins. All three patents teach that the polyolefin compositions are stabilized against degradation and/or discoloration upon exposure to heating at elevated temperatures, to the combustion products of natural gas, to gamma irradiation or to prolonged storage at ambient temperature.<br>
U.S. 4,612,393; U.S. 4,696,964; U.S. 4,720,517 and U.S. 4,757,102 disclose the use of va¬rious hydroxylamine compounds towards the stabilization of organic materials.<br>
Hydroxylamine stabilizers are also disclosed in U.S. 4,831,134; U.S. 5,006,577; U.S. 5,019,285; U.S. 5,064,883; U.S. 5,185,448 and U.S. 5,235,056.<br>

U.S. 4,898,901 discloses the use of long chain nitrone compounds as process stabilizers for polyolefin compositions.<br>
Despite the efforts towards a solution for reducing aldehydic contaminates in PET water bottles, for example, there still remains a need for more effective solutions.<br>
The instant invention is useful for any polyester or polyamide where aldehydic compounds, for example acetaldehyde, are formed or evolved during thermal processing of said poly¬ester or polyamide. Thermal processing of said polyester or polyamide includes the synthe¬sis thereof, thermal exposure during solid state polymerization (SSP), any injection molding, injection-blow molding or stretch-blow molding used in the manufacture of preforms, paris-sons, or bottles and containers, or extrusion of film, or during any melt processing of poly¬ester or polyamide above its glass transition temperature and below its decomposition tem¬perature.<br>
The instant invention provides for a lower amount of contaminants (i.e. aldehydes) in PET water bottles thus providing for improved taste or flavor in bottled water or other bottled beverages in said PET containers. The reduction in the amount of acetaldehyde is highly beneficial in this respect.<br>
Further, the compositions of the present invention impart no unacceptable color or haze to PET bottles. "Haze" is an undesirable, perceptible graying effect.<br>
The instant invention pertains to a composition, stabilized against the formation of aldehydic contaminants during melt processing of said composition, which comprises (a) a polyester or polyamide, and<br><br>
(b) an effective stabilizing amount of at least one compound selected from the group consisting of<br>
i.)   hydroxylamine stabilizers,<br>
ii.)   substituted hydroxylamine stabilizers,<br>
iii.) nitrone stabilizers, and<br>
iv.) amine oxide stabilizers.<br>
The polyester or polyamide of component (a) is 95-99.99 % by weight and the stabilizer or stabilizers of component (b), in total, are 5 to 0.01 % by weight, based on the total weight of (a) and (b).<br>
For instance, component (a) is 98-99.99 % by weight and component (b) is 2 to 0.01 % by weight of the total of (a) and (b); for example component (a) is 99 to 99.97 % by weight and component (b) is 1 to 0.03 % by weight, based on the total weight of (a) and (b).<br>
The additives of component (b) may be added to the polyester or polyamide of component (a) by known techniques. For example, the additives of component (b) may be added neat or as a solution or dispersion, with or without subsequent evaporation of the solvent. Compo¬nent (b) may also be added to the polyester or polyamide to be stabilized in the form of a masterbatch which contains component (b) in a concentration of, for example, about 2.5 % to about 25 % by weight.<br>
The polyester of component (a) has dicarboxylic acid repeat units selected from the group consisting of aromatic dicarboxylic acids having 8 to 14 carbon atoms, aliphatic dicarboxylic acids having 4 to 12 carbon atoms, cycloaliphatic dicarboxylic acids having 8 to 12 carbon atoms, and mixtures thereof.<br>
For instance such diacids are terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid, o-phthalic acid, naphthalene dicarboxylic acid, cyclohexane dicarboxylic acid, cyclohexanediacetic acid, diphenyl-4,4'-dicarboxylic acid, succinic acid, maleic acid, glutaric acid, adipic acid, sebacic acid and mix¬tures thereof.<br>
For example diacids are terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid or 2,6-naphthalene dicarboxylic acid.<br><br>
The diol or glycol portion of the polyester of component (a) are derived from the generic for¬mula HO-R-OH where R is an aliphatic, cycloaliphatic or aromatic moiety of 2 to 18 carbon atoms.<br>
For example such diols or glycols are ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, propane-1,3-diol, propane-1,2-diol, butane-1,4-diol, pentane-1,5-diol, hexane-1,6-diol, 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol, 3-methylpentane-2,4-diol, 2-methylpentane-1,4-diol, 2,2-diethyl-propane-1,3-diol, 1,4-di-(hydroxyethoxy)benzene, 2,2-bis(4-hydroxycyclohexyl)-propane, 2,4-dihydroxy-1,1,3,3-tetramethylcyclobutane, 2,2-bis-(3-hydroxyethoxyphenyl)propane, 2,2-bis-(4-hydroxypropoxyphenyl)ethane and mixtures thereof.<br>
The diol is for example ethylene glycol or 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol.<br>
The polyester of component (a) is for example poly(ethylene terephthalate) PET or poly-(ethylene 2,6-naphthalene-2,6-dicarboxylate); or instance poly(ethylene terephthalate).<br>
It is also contemplated that the polyester of component (a) can also be a blend of polyesters or copolyesters including components mentioned above.<br>

i between the amino and carboxylic acid group, of substantially equimolar proportions of a diamine which contains at least 2 carbon atoms between the amino groups and a dicarboxy-lic acid, or of a monoaminocarboxylic acid or a lactam thereof as defined above together with substantially equimolar proportions of a diamine and a dicarboxylic acid. The term "substan¬tially equimolar" proportions includes both strictly equimolar proportions and slight depar¬tures therefrom which are involved in conventional techniques for stabilizing the viscosity of the resultant polyamides. The dicarboxylic acid may be used in the form of a functional deri¬vative thereof, for example, an ester or acid chloride.<br>
Examples of the aforementioned monoamino-monocarboxylic acids or lactams thereof which are useful in preparing the polyamides include those compounds containing from 2 to 16 car¬bon atoms between the amino and carboxylic acid groups, said carbon atoms forming a ring<br><br>
containing the -CO-NH- group in the case of a lactam. As particular examples of aminocarb-oxylic acids and lactams there may be mentioned £-aminocaproic acid, butyrolactam, pivalo-lactam, e-caprolactam, capryllactam, enantholactam, undecanolactam, dodecanolactam and 3- and 4-aminobenzoic acids.<br>
Diamines suitable for use in the preparation of the polyamides include the straight chain and branched chain alkyl, aryl and alkaryl diamines. Illustrative diamines are trimethylenedi-amine, tetramethylenediamine, pentamethylenediamine, octamethylenediamine, hexamethy-lenediamine, trimethylhexamethylenediamine, m-phenylenediamine and m-xylylenediamine.<br>
The dicarboxylic acids may be represented by the formula HOOC-B-COOH, wherein B is a divalent aliphatic or aromatic group containing at least 2 carbon atoms. Examples of aliphatic acids are sebacic acid, octadecanedioic acid, suberic acid, giutaric acid, pimelic acid and adipic acid.<br>
Both crystalline and amorphous polyamides may be employed, with the crystalline species known for their solvent resistance. Typical examples of the polyamides or nylons, as these are often called, include, for example, polyamide-6 (polycaprolactam), 6,6 (polyhexamethy-lene adipamide), 11; 12; 4,6; 6,10 and 6,12 as well as polyamides from terephthalic acid and/or isophthalic acid and trimethylhexamethylenediamine; from adipic acid and m-xylylene-diamines; from adipic acid, azelaic acid and 2,2-bis(p-aminophenyl)propane or 2,2-bis-(p-aminocyclohexyOpropane and from terephthalic acid and 4,4'-diaminodicyclohexylmethane. Mixtures and/or copolymers of two or more of the foregoing polyamides or prepolymers thereof, respectively, are also within the scope of the present invention. Polyamides of the present invention are for instance polyamide-6; 4; 6; 6,6; 6,4; 6,9; 6,10; 6,12; 11 and 12. For example, the polyamide of the present invention is polyamide-4, polyamide-6, polyamide-6,6, polamide-12 or polyamide-6,4.<br>
The pojyamides of the present invention niay also include known polyamide stabilizers, for example Irgafos 168 (RTM) (Ciba SC), Irganox 1098 (RTM) (Ciba SC), Nylostab S-EED (RTM) (Clariant, CAS# 42774-15-2) and Polyad 201 (RTM) (Cul/KI/Zn stearate; weight ratio 10%/80%/10%). Irganox 1098 (RTM) (Ciba SC) is N,N'-bis(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl-propionyl)hexamethylenediamide. The polyamide stabilizers are employed at their known levels, for example from about 0.01 to about 1% by weight, based on polyamide.<br><br>
The polyamide compositions of the present invention exhibit improved resistance to yellow¬ing and improved mechanical properties.<br>
It is contemplated that the polymer of component (a) can be virgin polymer or alternatively polymer recyclate. Additionally, it is possible to add the stabilizer or stabilizers described for component (b) as part of a concentrate with a polyester or a polyamide carrier resin.<br>
The novel comgositioiTs by this invention are useful in the manufacture of contai¬ners or packages for comestibles such as beverages and food. Articles molded from these polyesters or polyamides exhibit good thin-wall rigidity, excellent clarity and good barrier properties with respect to moisture and atmospheric gases, particularly carbon dioxide and oxygen. Of special interest are fibers, films or molded articles.<br>
The plastic containers and films of the present invention are rigid or flexible mono- and/or multi-layered constructions. Typical multi-layer constructions have two or more layer lami¬nates, manufactured either by thermoforming, or extrusion of multi-layer flexible films, or extrusion of bottle "preforms" or "parissons" followed by subsequent blow molding of the pre¬forms into bottles. In a multi-layer system, layers of any suitable plastic may be employed.<br>
Multi-layered containers and films of this invention may for example, be formed from layers of polyesters, polyamides, polyolefins, polyolefin copolymers such as ethylene-vinyl acetate, polystyrene, poly(vinyl chloride), poly(vinylidene chloride), polyamides, cellulosics, polycarbo¬nates, ethylene-vinyl alcohol, poly(vinyl alcohol), styrene-acrylonitrile and ionomers, with the proviso that at least one layer comprises a polyester or polyamide composition of the present invention.<br>
For both films and rigid packaging (bottles), typically the exterior layer, and innermost layer contacting the contents, are composed, for example, of polyesters such as PET or PEN [poly(ethylene naphthalate)], polypropylene, or polyethylene such as HOPE. The middle lay¬ers, often called 'barrier' or 'adhesive' or 'tie' layers, are composed of one or more combina¬tions of either PET, PEN, carboxylated polyethylene ionomer such as Surlyn (RTM), vinyl alcohol homopolymers or copolymers such as poly(vinyl alcohol), partially hydrolyzed poly-(vinyl acetate), poly(ethylene-co-vinyl alcohol) such as EVOH or EVAL, nylons or polyamides<br><br>
such as Selar® (DuPont) or polyamides based on metaxylenediamine (sometimes called nylon MXD-6), or polyvinylidene chloride (PVDC), or polyurethanes.<br>
Accordingly, thjresgnUnventjon als	to a mono- or multi-layered plastic container<br>
or film, stabilized against the formation of aldehydic contaminants during melt processing of said conjainer or film, comprising at least one layer which comprises<br>
(a)	a polyester or polyamide, and<br>
(b)	an effective stabilizing amount of at least one compound selected from the groupj consisting of<br>
i.)	hydroxylamine stabilizers,<br>
li.)	substituted hydroxylamine stabilizers<br>
ill.)	nitrone stabilizers, and<br>
iv.)	amine oxide stabilizers.<br>
Rigid containers may be manufactured by known mechanical processes:<br>
a)	Single-stage blow molding such as performed on Nissei, Aoki, or Uniloy machines,<br>
b)	Two-stage, injection molding of pre-forms such as on Netstal or Husky machines, and pre-forms converted to bottles by blow molding (e.g., on Sidel, Corpoplast and Krones machines),<br>
c)	Integrated blow molding of pre-forms to bottles, such as processes conducted on Sipa, Krupp Kautex, or Husky ISB machines, and<br>
d)	Stretch blow molding (SBM) of pre-forms to bottles.<br>
Preferably, the plastic container is a rigid bottle.<br>
The pre-forms may be mono-layer or multi-layer in construction. The bottles may optionally be post-treated to alter the inner wall properties. Bottles may optionally be suri'ace treated on the exterior such as by application of surface coatings. UV absorbers and other known sta¬bilizers may be present in such added surface coatings.<br>
By the use of known heat-setting techniques, certain of the polyesters are, in terms of color, I.V. and heat distortion, stable at temperatures up to about 100°C. Such stability character-ristics are referred to herein as "hot-fill" stability. The linear polyesters most employed in ar¬ticles having "hot-fill" stability comprise poly(ethylene terephthalate), poly(ethylene terephtha-<br><br>
late) wherein up to 5 mole percent of the ethylene glycol residues have been replaced with residues derived from 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol and poly(ethylene 2,6-naphthaienedicar-boxylate), wherein the polyesters have been sufficiently heat set and oriented by methods well known in the art to give a desired degree of crystallinity.<br>
The polyester or polyamide fibers of the present invention are prepared by known tech¬niques. They may be woven or nonwoven. They are prepared by melt extrusion processes to form fibers or filaments. In accordance with known technology such as continuous filament spinning for yarn or staple fiber, and nonwoven processes such as spunbond production and meltblown production, the fibers or filaments are formed by extrusion of the molten polymer through small orifices. In general, the fibers or filaments thus formed are then drawn or elon¬gated. In nonwoven processes such as spunbonding and meltblowing, the fibers or filaments are directly deposited onto a foraminous surface, such as a moving flat conveyor and are at least partially consolidated by any of a variety of means including, but not limited to, thermal, mechanical or chemical methods of bonding. It is known to those skilled in the art to com¬bine processes or the fabrics from different processes to produce composite fabrics which possess certain desirable characteristics. Examples of this are combining spunbond and meltblown to produce a laminate fabric that is best known as SMS, meant to represent two outer layers of spunbond fabric and an inner layer of meltblown fabric. Additionally either or both of these processes may be combined in any arrangement with a staple fiber carding process or bonded fabrics resulting from a nonwoven staple fiber carding process. In such described laminate fabrics, the layers are generally at least partially consolidated by one of the means listed above.<br>
In laminate fabrics of the present invention, at least one layer comprises a composition of the present invention.<br>
Fibers of the present of the present invention are for example described in U.S. 5,650,509; U.S. 5,911,902; U.S. 6,294,254; U.S 5,049,447; U.S. 5,512,340; U.S. 6,010,789; U.S 5,589,530 and U.S. 6,020,421, the relevant disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
Fibers of the present invention may be employed for example in upholstery, clothing, gar¬ments, ropes, nets, tire cords, kites, parachutes and the like.<br><br>
Molded polyamide articles are for example employed in automotive applications (under the hood), and the like.<br>
Polyester films are well known in the art. PET films are employed for packaging for example for medical, food, industrial and decorative products. They are used as business graphics films in labels, printing base, office graphics and signs. They are used as industrial films for example in liners, as carrier, tape backing, protective overlay, membrane switch and for lami¬nating. They are used for example as imaging films in medial and proofing applications and as solar control and security window films. They are used for example in white coated film, white voided film, dimensionally stable film, extrusion coated film, tear resistant film, polari¬zing film, reflective film, dispensable film, coated film, co-extruded film, insulation film, wea¬ther resistant film, laminating film and mirror film.<br>

The following examples are for illustrative purposes only and are not to be construed to limit the scope of the instant invention in any manner whatsoever.<br>
General - PET bottle grade pellets are subjected to extrusion compounding to simulate the heat history which PET experiences when thermally injection molded into bottle preforms and subsequently stretch-blow molded into bottles. The efficacy of an additive added to reduce the formation of acetaldehyde is determined by quantitative analysis using thermal desorption GC-MS or GC-FID after adoption of published methods. An unstabilized PET is extruded each day to provide a control polymer for measuring acetaldehyde formation.<br>
Extrusion - PET is pre-dried in vacuo under nitrogen at an oven temperature of about 70°C to a moisture level of about 30 ppm which is verified on a Mitsubishi VA-06 moisturemeter. A Leistritz 18 mm or 27 mm co-rotating, non-intermeshing twin screw extruder is configured as follows: set temps = throat (220-230°C), zones and die (270°C), actual extrudate melt tem¬perature is 275-280°C, screw at 100-110 rpm, hopper feeder = 10-15 ppm.<br>
PET Pellet Color - Yellowness Index (YI), and L*, a*, b* by ASTM D1925, D65 lOdegm spe¬cular included, measured on PET pellets using a DCI spectrophotometer.<br>
Acetaldehyde Analysis - The concentration of acetaldehyde in PET is quantitatively deter¬mined using a thermal desorption GC-MS method adapted from B. Nijassen et al.. Pack¬aging Technology and Science, 9, 175 (1996); 8. Yong Lee, SPE ANTEC 1997, pp 857-861; and M. Dong et al., J. Chromatographic Science, 18, 242 (1980). A general example follows below:<br><br>
The PET samples are analyzed, in duplicate, by weighing 250 mg of powdered PET pellets (cryogenically pulverized) in a 5 mL crimp sealed headspace vial. The sample vial is heated at 120°C for one hour in a Tekmar model 5000 static headspace analyzer. The headspace gas (5 cc) is then transferred via a heated transfer line to a Fisons MD-800 GC-MS system for SIR detection of the acetaldehyde. The acetaldehyde is detected by monitoring its frag¬ment ions of 29 and 44 m/e. The Total Ion Current (TIC) of the GC-MS is also monitored in the retention time region of 4-8 minutes. By doing this the presence of acetaldehyde in the samples is confirmed by three different detectors. Alternatively, a GC equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) is used in place of the GC-MS system. By using a known acetalde¬hyde value for PET, the ratio of peak areas for the known PET resin and for the experimen¬tal PET resin blends are compared and the amount of acetaldehyde in the experimental blend can be obtained.<br>
Example 1: Stabilization of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET).<br>
Unstabilized commercial PET [CLEARTUF 7207 (RTM), Shell] is used as a control PET. When PET is extrusion compounded, a significant reduction in the amount of acetaldehyde (AA) is observed in samples stabilized with additives of the present invention compared to unstabilized PET, The % AA reduction is the amount less compared to the amount of AA in the control, all measured by GC-FID. Additive levelrare in parts per million (ppm) based on PE. The results are summarized in Table 1.<br><br><br>
"Hydroxylamine-A" is N,N-di(hydrogenated tallow)hydroxylamine as prepared in Example 9 of U.S. 4,876,300. "Nitrone" is the corresponding nitrone, tliat is primarily N-octadecyl-a-heptadecylnitrone.<br>
It is seen that the additives of the present invention provide significant reduction of acetalde-hyde versus the control in PET.<br>
Example 2: Stabilization of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET).<br>
Unstabilized commercial PET [CLEARTUF 7207 (RTM), Shell, Certificate of Analysis of 1.4 ppm AA as received] is used as a control PET. Upon a single extrusion heat history, the un¬stabilized PET increases in acetaldehyde (AA) content to an avg. of 3.0 ppm, indicating that PET produces undesirable AA upon heated melt processing. When PET is extrusion com¬pounded, a significant reduction in the amount of acetaldehyde (AA) is observed in samples stabilized with additives of the present invention compared to unstabilized PET. The % AA reduction is the amount less compared to the amount of AA in the control, all measured by GC-FID. Additive levels are in parts per million (ppm) based on PET. The results are sum¬marized in Table 2.<br><br><br>
"Hydroxylamine-A" is N,N-cli(hydrogenated tallow)hydroxylamine as prepared in Example 9 of U.S. 4,876,300. "Nitrone" is the corresponding nitrone, that is primarily N-octadecyl-a-hep-tadecylnitrone. "DBHA" is a dibenzyl hydroxylamine, Aldrich Chemical Co., 98+ %.<br>
It is seen that the additives of the present invention provide significant reduction of acetalde-hyde versus the control in PET.<br>
Example 3: Stabilization of poly (ethylene terephthalate) (PET).<br>
Unstabilized commercial PET [CLEARTUF 8006 (RTM), Shell] is used as a control PET. When PET is extrusion compounded, a significant reduction in the amount of acetaldehyde (AA) is observed in samples stabilized with additives of the present invention compared to unstabilized PET. The % AA reduction is the amount less compared to the amount of AA in the control, all measured by GC-FID. Additive levels are in parts per million (ppm) based on PET. The results are summarized in Table 3.<br><br><br>
"Hydroxylamine-A" is N,N-di(hyclrogenated tallow)hydroxylamine as prepared in Example 9 of U.S. 4,876,300. "Hydroxylamine-B" is a commercial sample of N,N-di(hydrogenated tallow)hydroxylamine, Irgastab FS-042 (RTM), Ciba Specialty Chemicals Corp., CAS# 143925-92-2. "Amine oxide" is Genox EP (RTM), a di(C16-C18)alkyl metlnyl amine oxide, CAS# 204933-93-7, GE Chemicals.<br>
It is seen that the additives of the present invention provide significant reduction of acetalde-hyde versus the control in PET.<br>
Example 4: Stabilization of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET).<br>
Unstabilized commercial PET [CLEARTUF 8006 (RTM), Shell] is used as a control PET. When PET is extrusion compounded, a significant reduction In the amount of acetaldehyde (AA) is observed in samples stabilized with an additive of the present invention compared to unstabilized PET.

It is seen that the acetoxyamine of the present invention provides significant reduction of acetaldehyde versus the control in PET.<br>
Example 5: Stabilization of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET).<br>
A base PET resin is prepared by extrusion compounding hydroxylamine-B [N,N-di(hydrogen-nated tallow)hydroxylamine, Irgastab FS-042 (RTM), Ciba Specialty Chemicals Corp.] at 0.25 wt% into PET. The base resin is redried, and the formulations of the table 5 below are prepared by extrusion compounding PET color concentrates with the PET base resin. The formulated products are redried and injection molded into 60 mil plaques and color data is obtained on a DCI Colorimeter in transmission mode. Comparison of the color value for the PET base resin containing 0.25% Irgastab FS-042 (RTM) (b* value = 10.83) with the colored formulations indicates that yellowing is significantly prevented in the present compositions stabilized against acetaldehyde formation. Oracet Violet TR (dye) is of the anthraquinone class. Cromophtal Blue 4GNP is of the phthalocyanine class.<br><br><br>
