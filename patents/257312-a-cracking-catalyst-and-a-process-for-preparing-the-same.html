Specification<br>
A cracking catalyst and a process for preparing the same<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a cracking catalyst used in oil refining and a process for preparing the catalyst.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
The trend of catalytic cracking stocks becoming heavier and heavier is so increasingly severe that higher cracking ability of the cracking catalyst and cracking process has to be required in order to realize an object of production of more light oil (gasoline and diesel oil) and liquefied petroleum gas.<br>
With regard to fluidized catalytic cracking (FCC) gasoline, olefins, aromatics and isoparaffins are main contributors of octane number. However, decreasing the olefin content of FCC gasoline is required due to environmental protection. In order to offset the loss of octane number caused by decreasing the olefin content, increasing the content of isoparaffins and aromatics in gasoline is required. Thus, there is a need of developing a cracking catalyst and a cracking process that are able to produce gasoline having lower content of olefin but higher content of aromatics and isoparaffins.<br>
Meantime, the quality of catalytic cracking diesel oil needs also to be improved, because the diesel oil obtained by using the existing cracking catalyst and process has a lower aniline point, a higher density and a lower cetane number. Thus, there is a need of developing a cracking catalyst and a cracking process that have relatively high cracking ability of heavy oil and are able to decrease the density of diesel oil and increase aniline point and cetane number thereof.<br><br>
Furthermore, light olefins and isobutane contained in the liquefied petroleum gas from a catalytic cracking are feedstocks of basic organic<br>
chemical industries. Currently, the supply of the light olefins (especially propylene) and isobutane falls short of demand. However, the content of light olefins (especially propylene) and isobutane is lower in the liquefied petroleum gas products from the existing cracking catalysts and processes. Thus, there is a need of developing a novel cracking catalyst and a cracking process that can be used to produce the cracking product containing more light olefins (especially propylene) and isobutane in the liquefied petroleum gas.<br>
CN 1042201C discloses a cracking catalyst for the production of more C3-Cs olefins. The catalyst consists of 10-50wt% of the zeolite-Y having a unit cell size^ 2.45nm, 2-40wt% of ZSM-5 zeolite modified with element selected from the group consisting of P, RE and H, and 20-80wt% of a semisynthetic matrix of kaolin and alumina binder.<br>
CN 1055301C discloses a cracking catalyst for the production of more iso-olefins and gasoline. The catalyst consists of 5-70wt% of a composite aluminum-base alumina binder that is made up with pseudo-boehmite and alumina sol in a weight-ratio of from 1:9 to 9:1, 5-65wt% of clay and 23-50wt% of molecular sieve. Wherein said molecular sieve is a mixture consisting of 15-82wt% of the zeolite-Y and the balance of a rare earth-containing pentasil high silica zeolite containing 0-10wt% of phosphorus(measured as P2O5) and/or HZSM-5 zeolite.<br>
CN 1072201A discloses a catalyst for the conversion of hydrocarbons to produce light olefins and gasoline with high octane number. The catalyst consists of 10-40wt% of three zeolites i.e. zeolite ZSM-5, zeolite REY and a high silica zeolite-Y, and the balance of a synthetic matrix or a semisynthetic marix containing 10-40wt% of silica and/or alumina binder. Wherein the amount of the zeolite ZSM-5 is 3-50wt%, and the amounts of the zeolite REY and the high silica zeolite-Y are each of 12-7 5wt%.<br>
CN1085825A discloses a catalyst for the conversion of hydrocarbons to<br><br>
produce-propylene, butene and gasoline with high octane number. The catalyst consists of 10-40wt% of three zeolites i.e. zeolite ZRP, zeolite REY and high silica zeolite-Y, and the balance of a-synthetic matrix or a semisynthetic matrix containing 10-40wt% of silica and/or alumina binder. Wherein the amount of the zeolite ZRP is 3-50wt%, and the amounts of zeolite REY and the high silica zeolite-Y are each of 12-75wt%.<br>
CN 1325940A discloses a phosphorus-containing catalyst for cracking hydrocarbons. The catalyst consists of 10-60wt% of a zeolite-Y or the zeolite-Y together with a MFI-structured zeolite and/or zeolite-p, 0-75wt% of clay, 10-60wt% of two kinds of alumina, and 0.1-7.0wt% of phosphorus measesred as P2OS, and 0-20wt% of rare earth measured as RE2O3. Said two kinds of alumina are from pseudo-boehmite and alumina sol, respectively. Although the catalyst has higher ability for the conversion of heavy oil and makes the olefin content lower in gasoline product, the use of the catalyst cannot improve the quality of the catalytic cracked diesel oil and cannot increase the content of light olefins and isobutane in the liquefied petroleum gas.<br>
CN 13 54224A discloses a catalytic cracking catalyst for producing isoparaffins-rich gasoline, propylene and isobutane. The catalyst consists of 0-70wt% of clay, 5-90wt% of inorganic oxides and l-50wt% of molecular sieve, wherein the molecular sieve is a mixture including (1) 20-75wt% of a high silica zeolite-Y having a SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 5-15 and a rare earth content of 8-20wt% measured as RE2O3, (2) 20-75wt% of a high silica zeolite-Y having a SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 16-50 and a rare earth content of 2-7wt% measured as RE2O3, and (3) l-50wt% of zeolite-0 or mordenite or zeolite-ZRP<br>
Alumina is a component included generally in cracking catalysts. In the prior art, alumina is mostly from alumina monohydrate and alumina sol, wherein alumina monohydrate includes boehmite and pseudo-boehmite. During calcination for preparing the catalyst, boehmite, pseudo-boehmite and alumina sol are converted all into y-alumina. Therefore, the alumina contained in catalysts aforementioned in the prior art is all y-alumina.<br><br>
Alumina may be also from alumina trihydrate. Alumina trihydrate includes a-alumina trihydrate, P-alumina trihydrate (Bayerite) and-Nordstrandite. During the preparation of catalyst, a-alumina trihydrate is converted into x-alumina, and p-alumina trihydrate is converted into T|-alumina.-Nordstrandite is only existence in nature, but there is no way to obtain by artificial synthesis. CN 1388214A discloses a process for preparing fluid cracking catalysts by drying a mixture of cracking catalyst components including clay, alumina and molecular sieve, wherein said catalyst contains 1.5-55wt% of alumina that is from |3-alumina trihydrate. Although said catalyst has higher activity for cracking heavy oil and better selectivity for light oil, it is not able to decrease the olefin content of gasoline, nor is able to improve the quality of catalytic diesel oil and increase the content of light olefins and isobutane in the liquefied petroleum gas.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a novel catalyst for cracking hydrocarbons. Said catalyst has higher ability for cracking heavy oil, and results in cracking products with lower olefin content of gasoline, higher quality of diesel oil, and higher contents of light olefins and isobutane of the liquefied petroleum gas.<br>
Although there are some examples in the prior art wherein alumina trihydrate is introduced in the preparation of cracking catalyst, it is used simply to increase cracking ability of cracking catalyst without effect on quality of gasoline, diesel oil and liquefied petroleum gas in the cracking products. The inventor of the present invention has unexpectedly found that when the alumina formed with alumina trihydrate, especially p-alumina trihydrate, and phosphorus, i.e. T)-alumina and phosphorus are introduced simultaneously into the cracking catalyst, a peculiar synergistic effect occurs that not only the cracking ability of the cracking catalyst can be increased, but also the quality of gasoline, diesel oil and liquefied petroleum gas can be substantially improved in the cracking products.<br><br>
