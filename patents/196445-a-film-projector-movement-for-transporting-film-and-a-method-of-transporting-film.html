				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to film transport systems for motion picture projectors and, more particularly, to a film projector movement that is capable of transporting film print having frames spanning a predetermined number of perforations per frame and then switching to another film format having frames spanning a different number of perforations per frame, without interrupting the operation of the projector du-rrhg the switchover.<br>
Conventional 35mm theatrical motion picture projectors employ a motor driven sprocket wheel which pulls the film intermittently through the film gate at a standard rate of twenty-four frames per second. During the period of film movement,, a rotating shutter driven by a constant speed motor blacks out the screen to prevent blurring. The viewing audience is unaware of these moments of darkness due to the phenomenon know as "persistence of vision." Film is supplied to and taken away from the film gate and intermittent sprocket by constant speed sprockets on either side. The periodic movement created at the film gate is smoothed out by film loops on either side of the intermittent sprocket, which are maintained by the constant speed sprockets.<br>
Current theatrical projectors are almost exclusively of the mechanical type. Typically, a single synchronous motor drives a drive shaft bearing multiple drive gears, each of which drives either the shutter or one of the film sprockets at the appropriate speed. The intermittent sprocket is driven by a device called a Geneva mechanism,<br><br>
the purpose of which is to translate one full revolution of the drive shaft into a ninety degree rotation of the intermittent sprocket followed by a stationary period for projection. The ninety degree rotation of a sixteen-tooth sprocket results in a four-perforation frame change (i.e., one "pulldown"). The four-perforation frame standard was established in the late 1800"s to accommodate a projected aspect ratio of 1.33:1 and has not changed since that time. Consequently, commercial 35mm projectors are designed for four-perforation pulldown.<br>
While virtually al\ theatrical 3 5mm projectors-"are of the mechanical design, there are several specialty projectors on the market which feature electronic pulldown. These designs rely upon a high response servomotor instead of the Geneva device to advance and position the film in the film gate.<br>
In the late 1950"s, the "1.85" screen format was developed in order to provide the audience with a "semi-widescreen look" without having to resort to anamorphic camera and projection lenses, used for true widescreen presentation, which optically squeeze a 2.35:1 aspect ratio   into   a   1.33:1,   four-perforation   frame. Approximately eighty-five percent of the films currently in release use the 1.85:1 format.   To achieve this projected aspect ratio, a mask is simply inserted into the aperture of the projection gate.  This mask covers the top and  bottom  areas  of  the  projection  frame,  thereby increasing the width to height ratio of the picture. Consequently, the exposed images in these masked areas are never seen.<br>
In the accompanying drawings, FIG. 1 shows this quite clearly.  The crosshatched area 6 4 represents the usable<br><br>
film area which is wasted in the 1.85:1 projection format with a frame height of four perforations. The area represented by the reference numeral 66 corresponds to the optical soundtrack. One solution to the problem of wasted film area is to change to an alternate frame height standard which provides the same projectable area as shown in FIG. 1, but without the wasted picture area at the top and bottom. One such alternate frame standard is the three-per"foration frame shown in FIG. 2. By eliminating much of the area previously wasted by masking, the same projectable area can be fitted into three perforations of film instead of four. Consequently, elimination-of this "wasted" area results in a reduction in release print footage, and therefore cost, by about 25%.<br>
While the three-perforation format is a step in the right  direction,  it  is  not  the  ultimate  in  film conservation since there is still some wasted area at the top and bottom that must be masked during projection. FIG. 3 illustrates the ultimate frame height for the 1.85:1 format wherein there is virtually no wasted film area.  The standard 1.85 format has an established picture width which is limited by the space reserved on the left side of the film for the optical sound track.   This limiting frame width,  together with the 1.85:1 aspect ratio,  establishes the minimum frame height of 0.446 inches.   When a few thousandths are .added for space between frames, this height corresponds to precisely 2.5 perforations of film length.  The 2.5-perforation pulldown format represents a. saving of about 37.5% when compared to the standard four-perforation format smd is currently being proposed as an alternate industry release print standard.<br><br>
From the foregoing, it is apparent that there are several alternate frame formats which are highly desirable for various reasons but which suffer from the problem of incompatibility with existing projection systems. The successful introduction of alternate frame format films into theatrical exhibition will reguire that these facilities be equipped with projectors that are capable of operating in all formats. It is essential that these projection systems retain the capability to project four-perforation format films along with the alternate formats, since anamorphic widescreen presentation requires the full four-perforation frame. Addit ionally, there will "always be some "classic" films and others (e.g., trailers and public service announcements) which remain in the original four-perforation format.<br>
Several designs have been proposed that attempt to provide three/four-perforation format changeability to existing projectors. However, the fundamental problem with these designs is that they require manual changeover of each individual sprocket in the projector when changing the format in either direction. This makes these designs wholly impractical due to time and manpower constraints. The present invention introduces a fully automatic switchable-pulldown film projector movement. This movement will permit the same theatrical projector to exhibit various alternate format films in "back-to-back" fashion without undue attention from technicians and without hesitation in the presentation. In this manner, the present invention satisfies the problems with the prior  designs and- provides further related advantages.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a switchable pulldown film projection system comprising a film transport system for transporting film through a projector. The film transport system, also referred to as a film projector movement or "head," includes a plurality of sprockets having teeth for engaging perforations on the film, and a motive element that rotates the sprockets and moves the film in a frame-by-frame manner past an aperture in the projector. In accordance with the invention, a controller is provided to regulate the motive element and" thereby maintain or change the rotational speed and position of the sprockets in accordance with the format of the film in terms of the number of perforations spanned by each frame. In this way, the film transport system is capable of running film in a variety of different formats, on the same projector, with a minimum amount of skill required, and without interrupting or delaying the operation of the projector.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the film transport system includes a pair of sprockets, one on each side of a film gate, and an intermittent sprocket between the pair for advancing the film frame-by-frame past an aperture in the film gate. The rotational speed of the pair of sprockets is determined by a variable speed motor, and the rotational speed and positioning of the intermittent sprocket is determined by another motor, such as a high-response servomotor. In this embodiment, these two motors comprise the motive element of the system. If desired, however, a single motor or three motors (or more) may be used as the motive element.<br><br>
The controller, which coordinates the output of the variable speed motor and the servomotor, includes a switch responsive to a trigger signal that indicates the film"s format. For example, the trigger signal may be information that is encoded on the film strip and read by a sensor. Based on the type of trigger signal that is received, the switch changes the output of the variable speed motor which, in turn, changes the rotational speed of the pair of sprockets.<br>
The variable speed motor also drives a plurality of synchronizing disks, each of which has a seVfes of apertures that are equally spaced around the circumference of the disk. A separate light source ai*d a photocell straddle each of the synchronizing disks. When in operation, the light source projects a beam of light that registers with the apertures upon rotation of the disks. Each synchronizing disk and its corresponding photocell are designed to control operation of the system in a different film format.<br>
The initial movement of the servomotor for each frame<br>
pulldown is controlled by the output of the synchronizing<br>
disks.  . Each time a beam of light passes through an<br>
aperture in the selected synchronizing disk, it is sensed<br>
by the corresponding photocell.   The photocell then<br>
generates a pulse which is fed through the controller to<br>
the servomotor to initiate an advance of the film by one<br>
frame.   A series of positioning disks rotated by the<br>
servomotor,  in combination with another pair of light<br>
source/photocell sets for each disk, are designed to feed<br>
information to the controller regarding film position to<br>
intermittently stop  film movement  at  the  appropriate<br>
position and assure proper registration of each frame at<br>
the   film   gate.      If   desired,   redundant   light<br><br>
source/photocell   sets   may   be   provided   on   each synchronizing disk and positioning disk.<br>
The trigger signal is designed to indicate when the film changes format, such as when there is a change from film having frames spanning four perforations per frame to film having frames spanning three perforations per frame. Of course, the trigger signal can be representative of a change between many different kinds of formats and, in general, is designed to indicate when the film format in the projector changes from a format having frames spanning one predetermined number of perforations to a* :"format having frames spanning another different predetermined number of perforations.<br>
The trigger signal to indicate a change in film format can be generated in a number of ways. In one embodiment, the trigger signal is generated electronically by a sensor coupled to a switch. The sensor may be, designed, for example, to read encoded information carried by the film as it enters the -projector to indicate a Change in the film"s format. This information may be encoded on a foil or magnetic strip, an optically read bar code, or by mechanical means. Alternatively, the trigger signal may be generated manually based on a visual inspection of the film by a film operator. Other suitable means of generating this trigger signal will be apparent, and the invention is not limited to manually or electronically generated signals.<br>
Regardless of the manner of signal generation, an important feature of the invention is that the film transport system is adapted to change between film formats without interrupting or otherwise stopping operation of the projector.  This eliminates any delays when switching<br><br>
between film formats, for example, so that different film formats may be spliced together on the same strip of film. Moreover, no special skill is required to make the changeover between film formats, as the system is designed to be simple and reliable in operation, without requiring any significant training. Furthermore, the film transport system may be designed to be retrofitted to existing 35 mm projection systems, thereby avoiding the high cost of replacing an entire projection system -, including the lamphouse, condensor, platter systems and other components.<br>
Other features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following description of the invention, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, which illustrate, by way of example, the principles of the invention.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
The present invention is embodied in a film transport system, generally referred to by the reference numeral 10, for transporting film 12 through a projector. As shown in FIG. 4, the film transport system 10 includes two constant speed sprockets, comprising a feed sprocket 22 and a hold¬back sprocket 24, located on opposite sides of a film gate 2 6 .  An intermittent sprocket 2 8 is located immediately<br><br>
below the film gate 26 and between the constant speed<br>
sprockets 22 and 24 to advance the film 12 intermittently,<br>
frame-by-frame, through the film gate in the usual manner.<br>
Thus, the intermittent sprocket 28 precisely registers<br>
each frame of the film 12 with the film gate 2G at the<br>
U.S. standard rate of twenty-four frames per second. The<br>
film gate 26 also includes an aperture 29 and a light<br>
source (not shown) for film projection. Slack in the film<br>
12, in the form of loops of loose £,ilm, is provided<br>
between the feed sprocket 22 and the film gate 26 and<br>
between the intermittent sprocket 28 and the hold-back<br>
sprocket 24 to prevent film breakage.	*■*"-"-"*<br>
The film transport system 10 also includes a motive element comprising a variable speed motor 30 and a servomotor 32. The variable speed motor 30 in this embodiment is a two-speed motor, such as a crystal controlled motor. However, as explained below, the variable speed motor 30 can be a three-speed motor, or it may provide additional speeds as desired. The servomotor 32 preferably is a high-response servomotor. Alternatively, it is contemplated that the motive element may comprise a single motor with mechanical or other means to drive and change the speed and position of the sprockets 22, 24 and 28.<br>
The variable speed motor 30 rotates an output shaft 34 extending from each end of the motor. One end of the shaft 34 is connected for rotation to the hold-back sprocket 24. The shaft 34 also rotates a drive wheel 36 which carries a timing belt 38 that couples the drive wheel 36 to a second wheel 40. The second wheel 40 is connected to a shaft 42 that rotates the feed sprocket 22 . Thus, the £eed sprocket 2 2 and the hold-back sprocket 24 are coupled together by the timing belt 3 8 and are rotated<br><br>
in unison at a constant speed by the variable speed motor 30.<br>
The shaft 34 on the variable speed motor 30 also carries a plurality of synchronizing disks. In this embodiment, there are two such synchronizing disks 44 and 46. Thus, the feed sprocket 22, the hold-back sprocket 24 and the synchronizing disks 44 and 4G, which are all commonly coupled to the shaft 34 of the variable speed motor 30, are rotated at the same rotational speed.<br>
The servomotor 32 also rotates an output shaft 48 extending from each end of the servomotor. One end of the shaft 48 is connected for rotation to the intermittent sprocket 28, and the other end of the shaft 48 carries a plurality of positioning disks. In this embodiment of the invention, there are two positioning disks 50 and 52. The servomotor 32 also rotates a velocity tachometer 54 at the outermost end of the shaft 48.<br>
FIG. 5 shows a section of film 12 having a plurality of perforations 56 along the edges of the film. Between the perforations 56 are frames 58 which, for purposes of illustration, are separated by vertical lines 60. The section cf film 12, which is standard 35 mm film, is shown as having different formats across its length. The left and right sections of the film 12 have a format in which each frame 58 spans four perforations 56. The center section of the film 12 has a format in which each frame 58 spans three perforations 56. The transition between these two formats is represented by a trigger strip 62, the function of which will be explained in more detail below. FIGS. 1 and 2, previously discussed, show the two film formats in greater detail.<br><br>
FIGS. 6 and 7 show the synchronizing disks 44 and 46 in more detail. Each synchronizing disk 44 and 46 has a plurality of apertures 68 that are equally spaced around the circumference of the disk. The first synchronizing disk 44 located outwardly on the shaft 34 from the second synchronizing disk 46 has six equally spaced apertures 68, and the second synchronizing disk 46 at the innermost end of the shaft 34 has eight apertures 68.<br>
A bracket 70 mounted adjacent to the synchronizing disks 44 and 46 carries a light source 72 that projects a beam of light toward each synchronizing disk. The"b5am of light registers with the apertures 68 in each synchronizing disk 44 and 46, such that a beam of light passes through each aperture when the synchronizing disks are rotated. A pair of photocells 74 and 76 are carried by the bracket, with one photocell located on opposite sides of the synchronizing disks 44 and 46 from the light source 72. Thus, when the light source 72 is operated, one of the photocells 74 or 76 selected for operation receives the beam of light each time one of the apertures 68 passes between the light source and the selected photocell.<br>
FIGS. 8 and 9 show the details of the positioning disks 50 and 52. Like the synchronizing disks 44 and 46, each positioning disk 50 and 52 has a plurality of apertures 78 that are equally spaced around the circumference of the disk. The first positioning disk 50 located outwardly on the shaft 48 from the second positioning disk 52 has six equally spaced apertures 78, and the second positioning disk 52 at the innermost end of the shaft 48 has eight apertures 78. The circumferential edge of each positioning disk 5 0 and 52 also is provided with a number of equally spaced vanes. 80.  Thus, the first<br><br>
positioning disk 50 has six vanes 80,  and the second positioning disk 52 has eight vanes 80.<br>
A bracket 82 mounted adjacent- to the positioning disks 50 and 52 carries two light sources 84 and 86, one mounted inside the other, that project beams of light toward each positioning disk 50 and 52. The innermost light source 84 projects a beam of light that registers with the apertures 78 in each positioning disk 50 and 52, such that a beam of light passes through each aperture when the positioning disks are rotated. Similarly, the outermost light source 86 projects a beam of light that passes to the other side of each positioning disk 50 and 52 through spaces 87 between each vane 80.<br>
Two photocells sets 88 and 90 also are located on opposite sides of the positioning disks 50 and 52, respectively, in registration with the two light sources 84 and 86. Thus, when the light sources 84 and 86 are operated, a corresponding pair of photocells sets 88 or 90 are selected for operation to receive the beams of light that pass through the apertures 78 and spaces 87 between the vanes 8 0.<br>
The operation of the film transport system 10 is described below and is best understood with reference to FIG. 4. For purposes of this description, it will be assumed that the film transport system 10 is initially set for operation with a film format in which each frame spans four perforations, followed by subsequent switching to a film format in which each frame spans three perforations, such as when these two film formats are spliced together on the same film strip.  For convenience, these two film<br><br>
formats are referred to below as the "four-perforation format" and the "three-perforation format," respectively.<br>
At the outset, the variable speed motor 30 is energized and commanded to rotate its output shaft 34 at the appropriate rotational speed corresponding to 35 mm film having the four-perforation format. This results in rotation of the feed sprocket 22 and the hold-back sprocket 24 in the film advance direction, thereby supplying and taking up equal amounts of film 12 on opposite sides of the film gate 26 and the intermittent sprocket 28. At the same time, the variable speed motor 30 also rotates the synchronizing disks 44 and 46?<br>
The light source 72 emits a beam of light toward each of the synchronizing disks 44 and 46 but, since the system 10 is operating in the four-perforation format, only the photocell 74 for the first synchronizing disk 44 is activated. For each beam of light that is received through one of the apertures 68 by the photocell 74, a corresponding pulse 92 is emitted from the photocell 74. Since there are six apertures 68 in the first synchronizing disk 44, there are six pulses 92 generated for each revolution of the disk.<br>
The pulses 92 emitted from the activated photocell 74 for the first synchronizing disk 44 are applied to an electronic controller 94 that controls the operation of the servomotor 32, which also has been energized. The intermittent sprocket 28 is driven by signals 96 sent to the servomotor 32 from the controller 94. These signals 96 are generated by the controller 94 based on the pulses 92 that are received from the photocell 74 and initiated by the first synchronizing disk 44. Thus, the signals 96 initiate rotation of the intermittent sprocket 28.<br><br>
As the intermittent sprocket 28 is driven, the film<br>
12 is advanced through the film gate 26 at the rate of one<br>
frame for each output pulse 92 of the photocell 74. Thus,<br>
there are six "pulldowns" of film frame for every<br>
revolution of the first synchronizing disk 44, which<br>
corresponds to one revolution of the twenty-four tooth<br>
intermittent sprocket 28 in six steps of four teeth each<br>
step, which is proper for the four perforation format.<br>
During this operation, the electronic .controller 94<br>
ensures that each film frame is positioned precisely in<br>
the film gate 26. This is accomplished in the following<br>
manner.	-■-<br>
As the intermittent sprocket 28 advances the film frame 58 into position in the film gate 26, the first positioning disk 50  is sensing the position of  the intermittent sprocket, and likewise the position of the fijm frame, by means of the apertures 78 and vanes 80 which permit beams of light from the light sources 84 and 86 to be received by the corresponding photocell set 88 for the first positioning disk 50.  Simultaneously, the velocity tachometer 54 mounted at the outermost end of the shaft 48 of the servomotor 32 is sensing the rotational speed of the intermittent sprocket 28.  Through a system of feedback signals 98 and 100, this information is being continuously monitored by the electronic controller 94, where  it  is used to shape  the voltage waveform in accordance with the need to accelerate, decelerate or stop the servomotor 32.  In this manner, the film frame 58 is rapidly moved into the film gate 26 and positioned with the  greatest  accuracy.    Such a  feedback  system  is described  in  U.S.  Patent  No.  3,819,258,  which  is incorporated herein by reference.<br><br>
As the film 12 continues to advance through the<br>
system 10, one of the trigger strips 62 on the film will<br>
be read by a sensor 102 ahead of the film gate 26.  In one<br>
embodiment, the trigger strip 62 carries information that<br>
is magnetically, optically or otherwise encoded onto the<br>
strip 62.  Ideally, the trigger strip 62 is located at the<br>
•splice between the two film formats.  The information read<br>
by the sensor 102  in this case,  by way of example,<br>
indicates  a  change  of  film  format  from  the  four<br>
perforation format to the three perforation format and an<br>
appropriate pulse 104  is generated by the sensor 102<br>
corresponding to this change in format.  This pulse 104 is<br>
amplified in an amplifier {not shown) where it is ".received<br>
by  switching electronics  106  comprising part  of  the<br>
overall film transport control. (The switching electronics 106 also activate the light sources 72, 84 and 86 via signals 107 and 109.)<br>
The pulse 104 from the sensor 102 causes the switching electronics 106 to send a signal 106 to the variable speed motor 30 to adjust its speed for operation in the three-perforation format. During this changeover, the photocell 76 for the second synchronizing disk 46 is activated, and the previously activated photocell 74 for the first synchronizing disk 44 is deactivated. As a result, the photocell 76 for the second synchronizing disk 4.6 will now receive eight beams of light for every revolution of the second synchronizing disk, thereby generating a corresponding number of pulses 9 2 that are sent to the electronic controller 94.<br>
It is noted that one revolution of the second synchronizing disk 46 corresponds to one revolution of the twenty-four tooth intermittent sprocket 28. Since each pulse 92 generated by the photocell 7 6 of the second synchronizing disk 46 is sent to the servomotor 32 via the electronic controller 94  and results  in one rotational<br><br>
advancement of the intermittent sprocket 28, and thus one frame pulldown, there are now eight pulldowns of three sprocket teeth each for every revolution of the second synchronizing disk 46, which is proper for the three perforation format.<br>
In the three perforation format, shown in FIG. 2, the frame"s center line, from left to right, passes through the center of a film perforation 56. In the four perforation format, shown in FIG. 1, however, the frame center line bisects the space between two film perforations 56 - - a difference of one half "* of a perforation between the two formats. Consequently, the first center-to-center step between a four-perforation format and a three-perforation format is a step of 3.5 perforations. Thereafter, the center-to-center spacing will be a constant three perforations per frame. The film transport system 10 is designed to accommodate this offset by an initial repositioning.of the intermittent sprocket 28. This can be accomplished by orienting the second positioning disk 52 (with eight apertures 78 and vanes 80 corresponding to operation in the three-perforation format) such that it lags the first positioning disk 50 (with six apertures 78 and vanes 80 corresponding to operation in the four-perforation format) by 7.5 degrees, which is the equivalent of one-half of a perforation on a twenty-four tooth sprocket. In this manner, the frame-to-frame spacing remains at three perfor"ations while the intermittent sprocket 28 is reoriented to maintain proper picture framing in the three-perforation format.<br>
The transfer of control from the first synchronizing disk 44 to the second synchronizing disk 4 6 takes place during the intermittent sprocket rest period. However, since the leading edge of the vane 80 and the aperture 78<br><br>
on the second positioning disk 52 are oriented to lag the first positioning- disk 50 by one-half perforation, upon first movement following a rest period the second positioning disk 52 will rotate only 7.5 degrees (H perforation) before the vane and the aperture cause pulses 98 to be emitted from the newly activated photocells 90. The electronic: controller 94 must be programed to ignore these initial changeover pulses and wait for the following set of pulses so that the film 12 will make the full initial advance of 3.5 perforations.<br>
Since the sensor 102 must be positioned aheaSKof the film gate 26, the passage of the trigger strip 62 over the sensor will generate a pulse 104 slightly before the film 12 is in the proper position for a changeover. Consequently, the switching electronics 106 must provide for a delay in the process. The period of the delay will be determined by the distance between the sensor 102 and the film gate 26, a constant, and the current mode of operation of the system 10, as determined from the encoded information on the trigger strip 62. Because the film 12 is moving slower in the three-perforation format, the delay period will be slightly longer. An alternative means for compensating for the offset position of the sensor 102 would be to offset the trigger strip placement (i.e., lagging} on the film print by an amount equal to the sensor offset from the film gate.<br>
At such time as another trigger strip 62 on the film 12 is read by the sensor 102, another pulse 104 will be sent to the switching electronics 106, which will signal all components of the system 10 to return to the operation condition corresponding to the four-perforation format, as described above.<br><br>
From the foregoing, it will be appreciated that the film transport system 10 of the present invention can switch back and forth between different film formats on the same strip of film 12, without interrupting or halting operation of the projector 14. This is a huge advantage for film producers, distributors, projectionists and exhibitors, who now have greater options in bringing two (or more) different film formats together on the same strip of film. The expense and effort in film distribution and exhibition, is thus greatly reduced. Moreover, for projection purposes, little skill or training is required to implement the changeover* between film formats, thus making the system ideal for operation by relatively unskilled movie theater employees.<br>
The switchable pulldown projection system will allow distributors to manufacture release prints in alternate formats which eliminate waste. In doing so they will save materials and money with no. concurrent reduction in the quality of the image shown to consumers. And the benefits of this process go well beyond those initial savings. Because the waste is eliminated, the prints are physically shorter and lighter. Therefore they cost less to ship and may even be shipped fully platter-mounted and ready for projection.<br>
Presently, a 100 minute film is 9,000 feet long and, owing to the weight, is shipped in 2000 foot reels. These reels must be joined together on the specific projector for the screen they are to be shown on. This process is called "mounting" the show. It must be done by a skilled individual such as a projectionist. When the theater management decides to move that print to another screen, it must usually be "broken down" and "remounted" again, as it is too heavy to easily move from projector to projector<br><br>
on a platter. However, in the new more-compact form made possible by the present invention, that same 100 minutes will be only 6,750 feet long (using film having a three-perforation format) or 5,625 feet (using film having a 2.5-perforation format). At this reduced length and weight, it will be possible to ship films in a single pre-mounted reel and move that reel from projector to projector without "breaking-down" and "re-mounting" the show.<br>
Of course, it will be understood that when a new reel of film 12 having a constant format is first loaded into the projector, the trigger strip 62 may be placed at the beginning of the film strip or a manual switch 130 must be activated to command the appropriate operation of the projector. Thus, upon reading the trigger strip 62 or upon activation of a manual switch 130, the switching electronics 106 can make the necessary adjustments, described above, to operate the film transport system 10 in the appropriate manner for the particular format of the film 12 being run through the projector.<br>
It will also be appreciated that the film transport system 10 is capable of switching, not only between the two film formats described above, but between any other number of film formats. Thus, by way of further example, the film transport system 10 may be configured to use the film format shown in FIG. 3, which illustrates a section of film 12 in which each frame 58 spans 2.5 perforation. To be able to switch from either one of the previously mentioned film formats to the latter format of 2.5 perforations per frame, requires changing the number of apertures 68 associated with the synchronizing disks 44 and 46 and the number of apertures 78 and vanes 80 in the positioning disks 50 and 52.   Alternatively,  if it is<br><br>
desired to switch between all three film formats, three synchronizing disks 44, 46 and 110 and three positioning disks 50, 52 and 112 may be provided, as shown in FIGS. lOa-lOd. The changeover among the three formats requires the variable speed motor 30 to be operable in three different speeds. It also requires that the number of teeth on the intermittent sprocket be changed to a number which is evenly divisible by 2.5, 3.0 and 4.0 which in this case is sixty teeth.<br>
Thus, the first synchronizing disk 44, corresponding to operation in the four-perforation format, *nbw has fifteen.  equally-spaced  apertures  68.     The  second synchronizing disk 46, corresponding to operation in the three-perforation format, now has twenty apertures 68.  A third synchronizing disk 110, corresponding to operation in the 2.5-perforation format, has been added.  This third synchronizing disk 110 has twenty-four apertures 68 and a corresponding light source.. 114 and photocell 116 to generate the required pulses that govern operation of the servomotor 32.  A corresponding number of apertures 78 and vanes 80 are provided in each of the first and second positioning  disks  50  and  52,  as  well  as  a  third positioning disk 112 that has been added corresponding to the 2.5-perforation format.  The third positioning disk 112 also has its own light source 118 and photocell set 120.<br>
It will be appreciated from the foregoing that different or additional film formats may be run on the film transport system 10 by appropriate re-configuring of the apertures, spaces and vanes associated with the synchronizing and positioning disks. Therefore, while not all of the synchronizing disks and positioning disks are shown in an elevational view, it will be apparent to those<br><br>
of skill in the art from the foregoing description, in conjunction with FIGS. 7, 9, 10b and lOd, how to configure the apertures, spaces and vanes to accommodate different or additional film formats on the film transport system 10, as desired.<br>
In addition, redundant sets of light sources 122 and 124 and photocells 126 and 128 may be provided for each of the synchronizing disks 44, 46 and 110 and positioning disks 50, 52 and 112. These redundant sets of light sources 122 and 124 and photocells 126 and 128 are illustrated in FIGS. 10a and 10c. This redundancy* helps ensure trouble free operation in the event of a malfunction of one of the sets of light sources 72, 84 or 86 or photocells 74, 76, 88 or 90. This redundancy may be provided in embodiment shown in FIG. 4 as well.<br>
When the film transport system 10 is switching from the four-perforation format t.o the 2 .5-perf oration format, an initial step of 3.25 perforations will be required. This is accomplished by positioning the third synchronizing disk 110 such that it lags the first synchronizing disk 44 by 4.5 degrees. In this manner, the first step will advance the intermittent sprocket 28 by an additional 0.75 perforations beyond the 2.5 perforations being commanded by the electronic controller 94.<br>
As previously discussed for the switchover from four-perforation to three-perforation operation, the 4.5 degree offset of the second positioning disk 52 will cause premature pulses 98 to be emitted from the newly activated photocells 90 upon changeover. The electronic controller 94 must be programed to ignore these pulses and wait for the next pair of pulses.<br><br>
Similarly, the changeover from the three-perforation format to the 2,5-perforation format will require a step of 2.75 perforations. However, this is automatically accounted for by the existing one-half perforation offset between the second synchronizing disk 46 and the first synchronizing disk 44.<br>
While FIG. 4 shows a separate sensor 102 at the film gate 26, it will be appreciated that the system 10 can use sensors already incorporated into existing projectors. Such sensors already are commonly used to dim house lights, open curtains and carry out other functions. It is also contemplated that the trigger strip 62 may be a foil strip which cannot be demagnetized, an optically read bar code, a mechanical trigger (e.g., notching, punching or embossing the film)or other appropriate means. Also, if desired, the sensor 102 can be replaced by a manual switch 130 on the projector 14 to initiate a format changeover based on a visual.inspection of the film 12 by a film operator.<br>
A further advantage of the film transport system 10 of the present invention resides in its ability to automatically rewind an entire platter system,  which supplies and takes-up film to and from the film transport system 10.  In prior  platter systems, the projectionist is required to re-thread the system between showings of each complete mounted platter.   Moreover, conventional film transport systems employ mechanical devices that prevent the execution of high-speed film rewind.  The film transport system 10 of the present invention, however, eliminates these mechanical devices and utilizes a fully electronic design that avoids intermittent movement at the intermittent sprocket 28 during the rewind operation and, therefore, provides a smooth, high speed film movement in<br><br>
reverse. The film transport system 10 can be commanded to operate in the high-speed rewind mode by providing a trigger stip 62 at the end of the film 12 which, by the process described above, commands the motors 30 and 32 to rewind the film at high speed.<br>
While a particular form of the invention has been illustrated and described, it will be apparent that various modifications can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
