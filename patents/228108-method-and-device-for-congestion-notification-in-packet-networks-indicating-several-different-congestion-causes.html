				<td>[Background of the invention]<br>
Data unit based communication networks are well known in the art. An example of a data<br>
unit based communication network is the so-called Internet. In data unit based<br>
communication a sender divides data to be sent into a plutality of parts, places these data<br>
parts into data units and sends the data units into the network. A data unit has a structure<br>
defined by a communication protocol being used and contains addressing or routing<br>
information, such that the network can forward each data unit to the intended destination,<br>
i.e. the receiver to which the sender would like to transmit the data. This is well known in<br>
the art and does not need to be explained in more detail.<br>
It is to be noted that within the context of various known communication protocols, such<br>
data units are sometimes referred to as packets, frames, segments, protocol data units<br>
(PDUs), etc. In the present application and claims, the term "data unit" is used generically<br>
to refer to any such data structure used for transport in a data unit oriented communication<br>
network.<br>
The communication network will generally comprise a plurality of devices arranged for<br>
receiving data units and forwarding them in accordance with the addressing or routing<br>
information contained in each data unit. Such devices are referred to by various names,<br>
depending on the type of network and the communication protocols employed, such as<br>
routers, switches etc. The terms "device for routing" or "device for forwarding" as used in<br>
the present application and claims are employed generically to relate to any such device<br>
capable of receiving and forwarding data units in accordance with routing or addressing<br>
information contained in the data units.<br>
Within such data based communication networks, the phenomenon of congestion is well<br>
known. Congestion means that a device for forwarding data units experiences an overload<br>
of data units and cannot forward as many data units as it receives. Devices for forwarding<br>
data units typically have a buffer for buffering data units to be forwarded. If such a buffer<br>
overflows, then this is one example of congestion occurring.<br>
As already mentioned above, the Internet is an example of a data unit based<br>
communication network. The protocols governing the transport of data units in the Internet<br>
are the so-called transmission control protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP), which are<br>
together also referred to as TCP/IP. In a communication governed by TCP/IP, a sender<br>
sends data units to a receiver over the network, where the receiver sends back<br><br>
acknowledgement messages relating to the receipt of the sent data units. Based on these<br>
acknowledgement messages, the sender can adapt its control procedure. For example, if<br>
the sender performs flow control in accordance with a sliding-window based technique,<br>
then the size and movement of the window is adjusted in accordance with the received<br>
acknowledgement messages. As another example, if the sender is performing rate-based<br>
flow control, then the rate is adjusted on the basis of the received acknowledgement<br>
messages.<br>
In its basic layout, a TCP/IP based network informs a sender of congestion by the indirect<br>
means of a routing device dropping data units. In other words, when a specific device for<br>
routing experiences buffer overload, then the excess data units are dropped, which means<br>
that they never arrive at the receiver . Consequently, by means of the corresponding<br>
acknowledgement messages (or lack of corresponding acknowledgement messages) the<br>
sender learns of the data unit loss. In accordance with TCP, a sender then enacts<br>
corresponding response procedures, e.g. a method known as slow-start. These response<br>
procedures are well known and need not be described in further detail.<br>
As an improved mechanism for dealing with congestion in a TCP/IP-network, RfC 3168<br>
proposes the concept of an Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN). The basic idea of ECN<br>
is to let a routing device in the network inform a sender of congestion by adding an explicit<br>
marking to data units being forwarded. It may be noted that such congestion notifications<br>
can be added to data units being transmitted in the direction from sender to receiver, and/or<br>
can be added to acknowledgement messages being transmitted from the receiver to the<br>
sender. If a marked data unit is being transferred in the forward direction (from sender to<br>
receiver) the congestion notification is mirrored in a corresponding acknowledgement<br>
message for that given data unit. When a data unit arrives at the sender with the congestion<br>
notification information set, the sender reacts according to predetermined procedures. In<br>
RfC 3168 an ECN field in the IP header is specified with two bits, which define four so-<br>
called ECN code points, i.e. 00, 01, 10 and 11.10 and 01 indicate that the end-points (the<br>
sender and receiver) are ECN-capable. 00 indicates that ECN is not used. 11 is the<br>
information set by a routing device as a so-called CE (congestion experience) code point,<br>
to indicate congestion to the end nodes.<br>
[Object of the application]<br>
The object of the present application is to provide an improved concept of dealing with<br>
congestion in data unit based communication. It is remarked that although the above<br><br>
description mentions TCP/IP as an example, the stated object applies to any data unit based<br>
communication system in which a type of congestion notification is used.<br>
[Summary of the invention]<br>
In accordance with one aspect of the invention, a device for routing data units and method of<br>
controlling such a device are provided, where the device for routing data units id capable of<br>
identifying one or more causes of congestion, such that in the event of congestion occurring,<br>
congestion cause information (information identifying the nature of the congestion) can be<br>
added to data units that are being forwarded.<br>
In other words, while the prior art teaches to only indicate the presence or absence of<br>
congestion, the present invention proposes to distinguish between at least two different<br>
congestion causes, and to add corresponding congestion cause information to data units being<br>
forwarded, such that the sender and receiver of a communication are capable of in turn<br>
recognising not only the presence of congestion, but also one or more causes thereof, i.e. the<br>
nature of the congestion that is occurring. Consequently, according to a second aspect, the<br>
present invention also relates to a communication device for sending data units and a method<br>
for controlling such a sending communication device, which sending device is arranged to<br>
extract congestion cause information contained in messages received from the network, in<br>
order to adapt the operation of controlling the sending of data units in accordance with the<br>
congestion cause information.<br>
It is noted that the congestion cause information can be provided in any suitable or desirable<br>
way. For example, it can be n bits (n &gt; 2), in order to distinguish between the presence or<br>
absence of n congestion causes. It may be noted that the concept of an explicit congestion<br>
notification and a congestion cause information can be combined in such a way that the<br>
congestion cause information itself also serves as a congestion notification information, or the<br>
two can be separate. In the latter case, one or more designated bits in a data unit serve as<br>
congestion notification information, while other designated bits serve as congestion cause<br>
information, whereas in the former case the same set of designated bits serves both as<br>
congestion notification information and congestion cause information.<br>
Using the concepts of the present invention, the response to congestion can be specifically<br>
tailored to the cause of congestion, which is a great improvement over the prior art.<br><br>
Expressed differently, while the prior art only taught to inform the sender and receiver in a<br>
communication of the presence of congestion, the present invention also informs the sender<br>
and receiver of the cause of congestion, such that the sender can take specific measures<br>
designed to specifically cope with the one or more identified causes. As an example, let it be<br>
assumed that a routing device is arranged in such a way that it can distinguish between two<br>
different causes of congestion: processing limitation and bandwidth limitation. Processing<br>
limitation describes a situation in which the routing device has problems in handling the<br>
number of packets arriving per unit of time. In other words, data units accumulate in a buffer<br>
because the routing device does not have sufficient capacity for processing the number of data<br>
units arriving per unit of time. Bandwidth limitation refers to the situation in which the output<br>
link or links have problems handling the amount of data to be forwarded per unit of time. In<br>
other words, the bandwidth on the output link(s) is not sufficient for handling the amount of<br>
data to be forwarded per unit of time.<br>
In the prior art systems, the routing device would only be able to set a congestion encountered<br>
(CE) bit, which indicates to the communication end points that congestion is occurring.<br>
However, there would be no information on the causes. In contrast thereto, the concepts of the<br>
present invention allow a routing device to add congestion cause information, e.g. an<br>
information that indicates whether a processing limitation is being encountered, a bandwidth<br>
limitation or a processing limitation and a bandwidth limitation. On the basis of such<br>
information, a data unit sender can react much more appropriately. This shall be explained on<br>
the basis of the following example. If one considers a rate-based application on the sending<br>
side, such as e.g. voice-over-IP (VoIP), then it is useful to react differently to processing<br>
limitation than to bandwidth limitation. Namely, in reaction to processing limitation, it is<br>
suitable to reduce the number of data units being output by the sender per unit of time while<br>
increasing the packet size, whereas a suitable reaction to bandwidth limitation consists in<br>
reducing the total amount of data being output per unit of time i.e. the rate, but retaining the<br>
number of data units being output per unit of time. If both bandwidth and processing limitation<br>
are occurring, then the sender can react by simultaneously reducing the number of data units<br>
being sent per unit of time and reducing the total amount of data being sent per unit of time.<br>

[Detailed description of embodiments]<br>
Although the following description of preferred embodiments of the present invention will<br>
sometimes make reference to TCP/IP as an example, it should be noted that the present<br>
invention is by no means restricted to TCP/IP, as it can be applied in the context of any<br>
data unit based communication in which congestion notification is used. It should therefore<br>
be noted that the term "congestion notification" as used in the present specification and the<br>
claims is used genetically and not to be seen as restricted to ECN as specified in RfC 3168.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a schematic representation of a device for routing data units in a network<br>
according to an embodiment of the invention. The routing device is referred to as 1. It is<br>
connected to lines 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, which represent connections to a network of<br>
which the device 1 for routing is a part. The lines 20-25 are only an example, as a routing<br>
device may have an arbitrary number or connections to its network. These connections<br>
may be physical and/or logical in nature. Reference numeral 10 refers to a receiver for<br>
receiving data units from the network and reference numeral 12 refers to an output unit for<br>
outputting data units to the network. The device 1 for routing data units furthermore<br>
comprises a processing section 11 comprising a buffer 111 and a control unit 110. The<br>
control unit 110 is arranged to control the operation of the device 1. For this purpose, the<br>
control unit 110 may comprise control elements consisting of hardware, software or any<br>
suitable combination of hardware and software.<br><br>
The buffer 111 is arranged to buffer data units received by the receiver 10. The output unit<br>
outputs buffered data units to the network on the basis of routing information contained in<br>
the data unit that are to be forwarded.<br>
Beyond the controlling of receiving data units in receiver 10, buffering data units in buffer<br>
111 and outputting data units via output units 12, the controller 110 furthermore comprises<br>
a congestion monitor (e.g. a suitable computer program or software element executed by<br>
controller 110) for monitoring whether the device 1 fulfils a predetermined congestion<br>
condition. The controller 110 furthermore has a congestion notification unit (e.g. an<br>
appropriate software element executed in the controller 110) for setting congestion<br>
notification information in one or more data units output by the output unit 12, if the<br>
congestion monitor determines that the congestion condition is fulfilled.<br>
The specific congestion condition monitored by the congestion monitor can be selected as<br>
is suitable or desirable. For example, it can be determined that the congestion condition is<br>
fulfilled if the degree of utilization of at least one of one or more resources of device 1<br>
fulfils a predetermined condition. The fulfilment can e.g. be the exceeding of a<br>
predetermined threshold. Examples of rssources that can be monitored in order to<br>
determine whether a congestion condition is given are a buffering capacity and a data unit<br>
processing capacity. For example, it can be determined that a congestion condition is given<br>
if the amount of data in buffer 111 exceeds a predetermined threshold. Is should be noted<br>
that the predetermined threshold in this case can be adjusted in any way that is indicative<br>
of congestion, i.e. can be smaller than the overflow limit of buffer 111. In fact, it is<br>
desirable to choose the threshold lower than the overflow limit, because then a congestion<br>
notification is given prior to buffer overflow, such that buffer overflow may in fact be<br>
avoided all together.<br>
In addition to or in place of monitoring the degree of buffer utilization, another resource<br>
that can be monitored is the amount of processing capacity used by controlling unit 110 for<br>
handling data units in the transfer between the receiver and the output unit. For example, if<br>
the controller 110 is a processor, then the amount of processor time allocated to the<br>
handling of data units can be monitored in order to observe the degree of utilization of the<br>
processing capacity.<br>
In accordance with the embodiment shown in Fig. 1, the device 1 for routing is arranged to<br>
implement a procedure shown in Fig. 2. In other words, the control unit 110 comprises a<br>
congestion cause identifying unit (e.g. in the form of a software program executed in<br>
control unit 110) capable of distinguishing between at least two different congestion<br><br>
causes, for identifying one or more causes of the congestion monitor detecting that the<br>
congestion condition is fulfilled. In Fig. 2, this is shown as a step S21 within the overall<br>
flow of control operations (said overall flow being indicated by the vertical dotted lines on<br>
the left-hand side of Fig. 2), which determines whether the predetermined congestion is<br>
fulfilled. If not, then the regular control routine, which is not the focus of the present<br>
application, is continued. However, if it is determined in step S21 that the congestion<br>
condition is fulfilled, then the procedure branches to step S22, in which the congestion<br>
cause identifying unit identifies the cause of congestion.<br>
Furthermore, the congestion notification unit is arranged to implement step S23 shown in<br>
Fig. 2, namely, for setting congestion cause information based on the one or more causes<br>
identified by the congestion cause identifying unit in step S22. This information is set in<br>
one or more data units in which congestion notification information is set.<br>
It is noted that the device for routing 1 can comprise a plurality of congestion notification<br>
units, e.g. one for each congestion cause that can be set in a data unit. For example, there<br>
can be one congestion notification unit that sets a bit indicating processing limitation and<br>
one congestion notification unit that sets a bit indicating bandwidth limitation.<br>
The congestion notification and congestion cause information can be set in any desired or<br>
suitable data units. For example, the information can be set only in such data units that<br>
comprise a specified source information (indicative of the sender) or a specified<br>
destination information (indicative of the receiver). Preferably, the congestion cause<br>
information will be set in all data units output from the output unit 12 while the congestion<br>
condition is present.<br>
The congestion cause identifying unit operated to implement step S22 is capable of<br>
distinguishing between at least two different congestion causes. The congestion cause<br>
information set in step S23 provides an indication whether none, one or several of the at<br>
least two different congestion causes are present.<br>
The congestion cause identifying unit can operate in any suitable or desirable way. For<br>
example, the mechanism for distinguishing between different causes of congestion and<br>
identifying a cause can be accomplished by observing the degree of utilization of two or<br>
more resources of the routing device 1, and identifying one or more causes on the basis of<br>
the observed degrees of utilization. In keeping with the above-described examples, the<br>
observed resources can e.g. be a buffering capacity and a data processing capacity. It<br>
should be noted that several buffer capacities and several data unit processing capacities<br><br>
can be observed. For example, the device 1 for routing can be arranged to observe the<br>
buffering capacity associated with the receiver for buffering data units upon receipt by the<br>
receiver, and can be arranged to monitor the buffering capacity associated with the output<br>
unit for buffering data units to be output. These buffering capacities can both be provided<br>
by a single physical buffer (e.g. the buffer 111 shown in Fig. 1), but can also be provided<br>
by a plurality of physical buffers, e.g. one buffer provided in receiver 10 and several<br>
output buffers provided in output unit 12. For example, each output line 23-25 can have its<br>
own respective output buffer. Alternatively, these buffering capacities can be represented<br>
by individual logical queues that are logically managed by buffer 111, e.g. an input queue<br>
associated with receiver 10 and a plurality of output queues associated with output 12.<br>
The plurality of processing capacities that can be monitored can e.g. be a processing<br>
capacity for controlling a transfer of data units from the receiver to the output unit or a<br>
processing capacity for controlling the output of data units from the output unit 12. This<br>
processing capacity can e.g. be provided by the control unit 110, which is generally a<br>
processor that executes predetermined software in order to provide the desired control<br>
function. The utilization of processing capacity can then e.g. be monitored by monitoring<br>
the amount of processor capacity assigned to the respective task. In other words, the<br>
processing capacity for controlling a transfer of data units from the receiver 10 to the<br>
output unit 12 can be monitored by observing the amount of processor time used for<br>
controlling this transfer, and the processing capacity for controlling the output data units<br>
from the output unit 12 can be monitored by observing the amount of processor time used<br>
for controlling the output of data units from the output unit 12 to output lines 23-25.<br>
As already mentioned, the congestion cause identifying unit may distinguish between<br>
different causes of congestion by observing the degree of utilization of two or more<br>
resources of device 1. Preferably, this is done by grouping the resources into one or more<br>
first resources and one or more second resources, where the congestion cause identifying<br>
unit is arranged to identify a first cause on the basis of the degree of utilization of the first<br>
resources, and to identify a second cause on the basis of the degree of utilization of the<br>
second resources. For example, a first resource can be a buffering capacity associated with<br>
receiver 10, where the degree of utilization of this input buffer capacity (e.g. the amount of<br>
data in the input buffer) is observed, and a processing limitation is determined as a first<br>
cause if the amount of data in the input buffer exceeds a predetermined threshold. As a<br>
second resource, one or more output buffer capacities associated with the buffering of data<br>
units to be output to respective output lines 23-25 can be monitored, and a bandwidth<br>
limitation can be identified as a second cause of congestion if one or more of these output<br><br>
buffer capacities is used to such an extent that predetermined threshold values are<br>
exceeded.<br>
Regarding the example of Fig. 1, it should be noted that although element 10 was<br>
described as a receiver or receiving entity and element 12 as an output unit or outputting<br>
entity, this was for the purpose of clearer description, and in general, a routing device will<br>
be arranged in such a way that the entity 10 will also be capable of outputting data units to<br>
be forwarded, just as entity 12 will be capable of receiving data units from the network.<br>
Furthermore, the buffer 111 and control unit 110 will also be arranged to control the<br>
transfer from data units received from a line connected to entity 10 to another, different<br>
line equally connected to entity 10, or to control the transfer of data units received at entity<br>
12 from one line to another line connected to entity 12. As such, a routing device can also<br>
be constructed as having a single receiving/outputting unit to which a plurality of network<br>
connections are connected. A buffer and control unit will then be connected to this<br>
input/output unit, in order to control the transfer and forwarding of data units from one<br>
network connection (acting as input link) to another network connection (acting as an<br>
output link). In such an embodiment, the receiver 10 and the output unit 12 are a single<br>
physical entity.<br>
The setting of congestion cause information in data units can be accomplished in any<br>
suitable or desirable way. For example, a predetermined set of bits in a specified part (e.g.<br>
the header) of data units can be reserved for carrying the congestion cause information.<br>
This is shown in the schematic example of Fig. 4, which represents a data unit. The data<br>
unit comprises delimiters 51 and 52, which mark the beginning and end, respectively, of<br>
the data unit. Section 56 represents a header, and section 57 a payload. The header 56 can<br>
e.g. be divided into a variety of sections comprising specified information, such as in<br>
section 53 identifying the type of the data unit, section 54 containing routing information<br>
for routing the data unit, and section 55 containing a variety of control information, such as<br>
error correction information (e.g. cyclic redundancy check data). In the example of Fig. 4,<br>
the control section 55 of the data unit also has a designated section 550, in which the<br>
congestion control information is set. In a simple case, the congestion cause information<br>
can consist of two bits. This provides four combinations, where a first combination (e.g.<br>
00) indicates no congestion, a second combination (e.g. 10) indicates the presence of a first<br>
congestion cause, a third combination (e.g. 01) indicated the presence of a second<br>
congestion cause, and a fourth combination (e.g. 11) indicates the presence of both the first<br>
and second congestion cause. Naturally, the congestion cause information can comprise an<br>
arbitrary number n of bits in order to provide 2n combinations of congestion causes.<br><br>
It should be noted that the data unit shown schematically in Fig. 4 is only an example, and<br>
other data structures are possible, e.g. using a trailer instead of or in addition to a header.<br>
As already mentioned earlier, the congestion cause information can structurally be<br>
identical with the congestion notification information. This can be seen in the above<br>
example, where 00 represents no congestion, and any other combinations represents<br>
congestions. Further, it is equally well possible to implement the congestion cause<br>
information as an additional set of information to a congestion notification information.<br>
For example, when using TCP/IP one can retain the ECN mechanism as defined in RfC<br>
3168, and simply define an additional set of bits that conveys the additional congestion<br>
cause information. The advantage of keeping congestion notification information and<br>
congestion cause information separate is that a backwards compatibility with such systems<br>
that are capable of processing congestion notification information, but not capable of<br>
processing congestion cause information, is provided.<br>
Now a further aspect of the present invention will be described, namely the exploitation of<br>
the congestion cause information by a communication device that sends data units into a<br>
network. This is schematically shown in Fig. 3. Reference numeral 3 refers to a network<br>
that contains routing or forwarding devices 33-44. The various routing devices 33-44 are<br>
interconnected, and furthermore connected with other routing devices not shown in Fig. 3,<br>
which is indicated by dotted lines. Fig. 3 furthermore shows a first communication device<br>
31, which is connected to network 3 and acts as a sending communication device, and a<br>
second communication device 32, which is also connected to network 3 and acts as a<br>
receiving communication device. More specifically, the sending communication device 31<br>
sends data units into the network 3 via a connection with routing device 33. The<br>
connection between communication device 31 and routing device 33 can be established in<br>
any desired or suitable way, e.g. can be a fixed wire line or can be a wireless connection.<br>
The data units sent by the communication device 31 in the network 3 comprise routing or<br>
addressing information, such that the network 3 is capable of forwarding the data units to<br>
the desired destination 32. This basic concept is well known in the art and therefore does<br>
not need to be described in more detail.<br>
In accordance with the present application, one or more of the routing devices 33-44 is<br>
arranged as described in connection with Fig. 1, i.e. the routing devices operating in<br>
accordance with the invention are not only capable of monitoring whether congestion has<br>
occurred, but are also capable of identifying a cause of congestion and setting appropriate<br>
information in appropriate corresponding data units. Preferably, the congestion cause<br><br>
information will be set in all data units output from the output unit 12 (see Fig. 1) while the<br>
congestion condition is present.<br>
The forwarded data units are received by receiving communication device 32, where the<br>
receiving communication device 32 is arranged to send acknowledgement message into the<br>
network 3. The acknowledgement messages contain routing or addressing information that<br>
directs the acknowledgement messages to sending communication device 31. The<br>
acknowledgement messages contain receipt information regarding the receipt of data units,<br>
and possibly contain congestion notification information and congestion cause information<br>
set by one or more routing devices in forwarded data units. In other words, the receiving<br>
communication device 32 is arranged to mirror congestion notification information and/or<br>
congestion cause information contained in received data units. The basic mechanism of<br>
sending acknowledgement messages in response to receiving data units from a sending<br>
communication device is well known as ARQ (Automatic Repeat reQuest) in the art, such<br>
that a further description is not necessary.<br>
The acknowledgement messages are then forwarded by network 3 to the sending<br>
communication device 31. It should be noted that the routing devices operating in<br>
accordance with the concepts of the present invention are not only capable of setting<br>
congestion notification and congestion cause information in data units being sent in the<br>
forward direction (from sending communication device 31 to receiving communication<br>
device 32), but also capable of setting congestion notification information and congestion<br>
cause information in acknowledgement messages being sent in reverse direction (i.e. from<br>
the receiving communication device 32 to the sending communication device 31). It may<br>
be noted that the acknowledgment messages are also data units, e.g. like shown in Fig. 4.<br>
A sending communication device 31 according to the present invention is arranged such<br>
that it may execute the method schematically shown by the flowchart of Fig. 5. Namely, in<br>
a step S61 which occurs in the overall control procedure of communication device 31, it is<br>
determined whether congestion cause information is present in a received<br>
acknowledgement message. If not, then the regular control continues. If congestion cause<br>
information is present in a received acknowledgement message, the procedure branches to<br>
step S62, in which the congestion cause information is extracted, and in subsequent step<br>
S63 the control procedure is adapted in accordance with the extracted congestion cause. As<br>
already specified earlier, the congestion cause information can be designed in such a way<br>
that it can indicate the presence or absence of n different causes of congestion, where each<br>
acknowledgement message can thereby contain one of 2n different combinations of<br>
congestion causes. The communication device 31 operating in accordance with the present<br><br>
invention can then e.g. be arranged to simply identify a congestion cause combination (e.g.<br>
a specific bit combination) in a specified field (namely the congestion cause field) of an<br>
acknowledgement message, and to invoke a response procedure corresponding to the<br>
identified congestion cause combination. As an example, the communication device 31 can<br>
keep a record or table of possible congestion cause combinations (e.g. respective bit<br>
patterns) where each congestion cause information is linked to an associated response<br>
procedure. It is possible that each different congestion causes combination is linked to a<br>
different response procedure or that several different congestion combinations are linked to<br>
the same response procedure. This will generally depend on the specific system and can be<br>
chosen as is suitable or desirable.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the communication device 31 is arranged to extract<br>
first and second congestion cause information, where the first congestion cause<br>
information is associated with congestion due to the incapacity to handle the number of<br>
data units being transported over the network (i.e. processing limitation) and the second<br>
congestion cause information is associated with congestion due to the incapacity to handle<br>
the amount of data being transported (i.e. bandwidth limitation). Then, the communication<br>
device 31 is preferably arranged such that it responds to the extraction of the first<br>
congestion cause information by reducing the number of data units output to the network<br>
per unit of time, and to respond to the extraction of the second congestion cause<br>
information by reducing the amount of data output to the network per unit of time.<br>
Regarding the setting of congestion cause information in the form of individual bits in a<br>
predetermined number n of bits, it should be noted that when a plurality of routing devices<br>
along a connection are capable of setting one or more bits that correspond to respective<br>
congestion causes, then consecutive routing devices can set different bits depending on<br>
their individual congestion state. As an example, if the congestion cause information is<br>
such that two causes are distinguished (i.e. two bits are used), it is possible that a first<br>
routing device will set the first bit to 1 (thereby e.g. indicating a processing limitation) and<br>
a second routing device (e.g. 36 in Fig. 3) sets the second bit to 1 (thereby indicating a<br>
bandwidth limitation). In this way, after mirroring the congestion cause information in an<br>
acknowledgement message sent by receiving communication device 32, the sending<br>
communication device 31 is informed that both the first congestion cause (e.g. processing<br>
limitation) and the second congestion cause (e.g. bandwidth limitation) are present in the<br>
network 3.<br>
The above-described concept associated with modifying a sending communication device<br>
is preferably applied to rate-based sending applications. As an example, one may consider<br><br>
a Voice-over-IP (VoIP) application using a codec that outputs a speech frame within a<br>
predetermined time period. For example, the AMR (adaptive multi rate) codec outputs one<br>
speech frame every 20 ms. The codec is capable of switching its encoding rate on a per<br>
frame basis between a plurality of different encoding rates. For example, the AMR codec<br>
is capable of switching between 8 different encoding rates ranging from 4.75 to 12.2 kbps.<br>
The speech frames output by the codec are embedded into data units that can be sent over<br>
the network. For example, the speech frames could be consecutively embedded into a<br>
Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) data unit, a Datagram Congestion Control Protocol<br>
(DCCP) data unit and then an Internet protocol (IP) data unit.<br>
According to a preferred example of the invention, the congestion cause information is<br>
coded as two bits, where a first combination (e.g. 00) indicates no congestion, a second<br>
combination (e.g. 10) indicates the presence of processing limitation, a third combination<br>
(e.g. 01) indicates the presence of bandwidth limitation and a fourth combination (e.g. 11)<br>
indicates the presence of both processing and bandwidth limitation.<br>
Upon reception of feedback (i.e. an acknowledgement message) from the network, the<br>
VoIP application could use an appropriate decision table, where 00 is linked to no response<br>
(this corresponds to the outcome "no" in step S61 of the example shown in Fig. 5), and<br>
where 10 is linked to a response option 1, 01 is linked to a response option 2 and 11 is<br>
linked to a response option 3.<br>
Response option 1 can then consist in reducing the number of data units (e.g. IP packets)<br>
output by the application, by increasing the number of speech frames per data unit. This is<br>
an appropriate reaction to processing limitation, because the network receives a reduced<br>
number of data units to process per unit of time. From the point of view of the VoIP<br>
application, this leads to an increased delay.<br>
Response option 2 can consist in leaving the number of speech frames per data unit<br>
constant and instead reducing the coding-rate. This results in a constant number of data<br>
units, however, each individual data unit is smaller. This is an appropriate reaction to<br>
bandwidth limitation, since the amount of data (i.e. the number of bytes) arriving in the<br>
network decreases. From an application point of view, the penalty to be paid is a decreased<br>
quality.<br>
Response option 3 can consist in implementing both options 1 and 2, i.e. reducing the<br>
encoding rate and increasing the number of speech frames per data unit. From the view<br>
point of the application, this response leads to decreased quality and increased delay.<br><br>
In comparison with the system of the prior art, the benefit of the present application is<br>
immediately recognisable from the above example. Namely, while the prior art only<br>
indicates the presence or absence of congestion, the present invention allows to distinguish<br>
the causes of congestion. This means that in the prior art, the above situation with respect<br>
to a VoIP application forces to implement response option 3 in reaction to a congestion<br>
notification, because it can not be determined what the causes are. As one can not<br>
determine the cause, one has to provide a reaction that is capable of alleviating all possible<br>
causes, e.g. processing limitation and bandwidth limitation. This then has the consequence<br>
that in the event of congestion, one always has a decrease in quality and increase in delay.<br>
In contrast thereto, the present invention is such that the cause of congestion can be<br>
identified, such that the correct reaction on the part of the sending communication device<br>
can be enacted, which in turn means that only the necessary performance degradation has<br>
to be tolerated. In other words, in the event of processing limitation, one only has to<br>
tolerate increased delay, but not decreased quality, and in the event of bandwidth<br>
limitation, one only has to tolerate decreased quality, but not increased delay.<br>
Although the above example is related to VoIP, it is to be noted that the same positive<br>
effects of the present invention can be achieved in any application using congestion<br>
feedback, such as streaming, mobile gaming and any application using TFRC (TCP<br>
Friendly Rate Control) and/or TFRC-PS (TCP Friendly Rate Control Packet Size) for<br>
congestion control. Naturally, the individual response options will depend on the specific<br>
application and the individual requirements associated therewith.<br>
Embodiments of the present invention can be provided in the form of hardware, software<br>
or any suitable combination of hardware and software. The present invention can also be<br>
embodied in the form of a data carrier storing a computer program that is capable of<br>
executing a method according to the invention.<br>
Although the present invention has been described by way of examples, these only serve to<br>
provide a comprehensive understanding and are not intended to be limiting. Much rather,<br>
the scope of the present invention is determined by the appended claims. Furthermore,<br>
reference numerals in the claims are not limiting, but only serve to make the claims easier<br>
to read.<br><br>
