				<td>This invention relates to a single-use syringe, more<br>
particularly to a single-use syringe, in which fluid-tightness<br>
of a barrel is disrupted when the syringe is displaced to a<br>
disposal position so as to render the syringe unreusable.<br>
Referring to Figs . 1 and 2, a conventional single-use syringe<br>
is shown to include a barrel 11 which has an axially extending<br>
surrounding wall 113 defining front and rear passageways 112, 111,<br>
and a surrounding shoulder 114 disposed between the front and<br>
rear passageways 112 , 111, a needle assembly 12 which is sleeved<br>
on a front opened end of the surrounding wall 113, a plunger<br>
13 which is disposed to be movable in and along the rear passageway<br>
111 and which has a taperedhead 131 formed ona front end thereof,<br>
a deformable sealing member 14 which is retainingly sleeved<br>
on the tapered head 131, which is in fluid-tight and slidable<br>
engagement with the surrounding wall 113 at the rear passageway<br>
111, and which has an axially extending vent hole 132<br>
communicated with the ambient air, and a plug 15 which is<br>
detachably connected to the deformable sealing member 14 and<br>
which closes the vent hole 132. An inner surface of the<br>
surrounding wall 113 has a retaining ring 115 formed adjacent<br>
to the shoulder 114. The plug 15 has an anchoring portion 151<br>
projecting forwardly and outwardly of the deformable sealing<br>
member 14 such that, subsequent to completion of injection,<br>
the deformable sealing member 14 is brought to abut against<br>
the shoulder 114 and the anchoring portion 151 is engaged with<br>
the retaining ring 115 to thereby permit disengagement of the<br>
plug 15 from the deformable sealing member 14 when the plunger<br>
13 is pulled rearwardly, and to thereby disrupt the<br>
fluid-tightness of the vent hole 132 for rendering the syringe<br>
unreusable. However, when the anchoring portion 151 is forced<br>
to be engaged with the retaining ring 115, the frictional force<br>
between the plug 15 and the deformable sealing member 14 is<br>
increased, which may be greater than the force of engagement<br>
between the anchoring portion 151 and the retaining ring 115,<br>
thereby adversely affecting separation of the plug 15 from the<br>
deformable sealing member 14. Moreover, formation of the<br>
retaining ring 115 on the inner surface of the barrel 11 is<br>
inconvenient during manufacture.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a single-use<br>
syringe which has friction diminishing means to facilitate<br>
disruption of fluid-tightness of a surrounding area in a barrel<br>
when the syringe is displaced to a disposal position so as to<br>
render the syringe unreusable.<br>
According to this invention, the single-use syringe<br>
includes a barrel having an inner surrounding barrel surface<br>
which surrounds an axis in a longitudinal direction, and which<br>
includes a rear larger-diameter portion that defines a rear<br>
passageway therein, a front smaller-diameter portion that<br>
defines a front passageway therein to be in fluid communication<br>
with a needle assembly and that is opposite to the rear<br>
larger-diameter portion in the longitudinal direction, and a<br>
surrounding shoulder that is disposed between the rear<br>
larger-diameter portion and the front smaller-diameter portion.<br>
The rear passageway terminates at a rearward opening.<br>
A plunger is disposed to be movable in the rear passageway<br>
along the larger-diameter portion. The plunger has a front end<br>
wall which confronts the front passageway, and a rear end wall<br>
which is disposed opposite to the front end wall and which extends<br>
outwardly of the rearward opening to be manually operable.<br>
A carrier includes a tail portion which extends from the<br>
front end wall along the axis, a head portion which is disposed<br>
opposite to the tail portion in the rear passageway along the<br>
axis, and an intermediate surrounding portion which is<br>
interposed between the tail and head portions and which<br>
surrounds the axis. The intermediate surrounding portion has<br>
a pushing region and a retained region which are proximate to<br>
the tail and head portions, respectively.<br>
A hollow deformable sealing member includes a head end wall<br>
which has a periphery and which confronts the surrounding<br>
shoulder, an upper sealing end which is integrally formed with<br>
the periphery of the head end wall and which is in fluid-tight<br>
and slidable engagement with the rear larger-diameter portion,<br>
and a deformable surrounding wall which extends from the upper<br>
sealing end rearwardly and which terminates at a surrounding<br>
trailing end that is configured to drag on the rear<br>
larger-diameter portion. The deformable surrounding wall has<br>
an outer surrounding wall surface which is spaced apart from<br>
the rear larger-diameter portion in radial directions when the<br>
syringe is in a position of use, thereby vesting the deformable<br>
surrounding wall with an increased radial flexibility, and an<br>
inner surrounding wall surface which is opposite to the outer<br>
surrounding wall surface in radial directions. The inner<br>
surrounding wall surface has a yielding segment which is engaged<br>
with and which is depressed by the pushing region radially when<br>
the carrier is moved in a longitudinal direction relative to<br>
the deformable surrounding wall so as to bring the head end<br>
wall to abut against and to be retained at the surrounding<br>
shoulder, thereby displacing the syringe from the position of<br>
use to a disposal position, and a retaining segment which is<br>
in a f rictional engagement with the retained region by virtue<br>
of a frictional force so as to confine, in cooperation with<br>
the yielding segment and the pushing region, a fluid-tight<br>
surrounding area, and which is configured such that the<br>
frictional force is diminished so as to facilitate release of<br>
the retained region from the retaining segment when the yielding<br>
segment is depressed by the pushing region, thereby disrupting<br>
the fluid-tightness of the surrounding area and rendering the<br>
syringe unreusable.<br>

it should be noted that same reference numerals have been used<br>
to denote like elements throughout the specification.<br>
Referring to Figs. 3 and 4, the first preferred embodiment<br>
of a single-use syringe according to the present invention is<br>
shown to be used with a needle assembly 3 . The needle assembly<br>
3 includes a needle hub 31 and a needle cannula 32 . The syringe<br>
comprises a barrel 2, a plunger 4, a carrier 5, and a hollow<br>
deformable sealing member 6.<br>
The barrel 2 has an inner surrounding barrel surface 23<br>
which surrounds an axis (X) in a longitudinal direction, and<br>
which includes a rear larger-diameter portion that defines a<br>
rear passageway 21 therein, a front smaller-diameter portion<br>
that defines a front passageway 22 therein to be in fluid<br>
communication with the needle assembly 3 in a known manner,<br>
and that is opposite to the rear larger-diameter portion in<br>
the longitudinal direction, and a surrounding shoulder 24 that<br>
is disposed between the rear larger-diameter portion and the<br>
front smaller-diameter portion. The front and rear passageways<br>
22,21 respectively terminate at forward and rearward openings<br>
231,232.<br>
The plunger 4 is disposed to be movable in the rear passageway<br>
21 along the larger-diameter portion. The plunger 4 has a front<br>
end wall 41 which confronts the front passageway 22, and a rear<br>
end wall 42 which is disposed opposite to the front end wall<br>
41 along the longitudinal direction and which extends outwardly<br>
of the rearward opening 232 to be manually operable.<br>
The carrier 5 includes a tail portion 517 which extends<br>
from the front end wall 41 along the axis (X) , a head portion<br>
523 which is disposed in the rear passageway 21 opposite to<br>
the tail portion 517 and along the axis (X) , and an intermediate<br>
surrounding portion which is interposed between the tail and<br>
head portions 517,523 and which surrounds the axis (X). The<br>
intermediate surrounding portion includes a tubular pushing<br>
segment 51 and a tubular retained segment 52 . The pushing segment<br>
51 is coupled and formed integrally with the tail portion 517,<br>
and terminates at an opened end 513. The pushing segment 51<br>
has an inner surrounding engaging region 514 which extends in<br>
the longitudinal direction to be communicated with the opened<br>
end 513 and which defines a cavity 511, and a pushing region<br>
516 which is disposed radially and outwardly of the inner<br>
surrounding engaging region 514. Preferably, the pushing<br>
segment 51 is converged from the pushing region 516 to the opened<br>
end 513. A vent hole 515 is formed in the pushing segment 51,<br>
and extends along the axis (X) to be in fluid communication<br>
with the cavity 511. The retained segment 52 has an outer<br>
surrounding retained wall 521 which extends from the head<br>
portion 523 in the longitudinal direction to terminate at an<br>
outer engaging end 524 and which is insertable into the cavity<br>
511. The outer surrounding retained wall 521 has two annular<br>
grooves 525,526, and a projecting retained region 527 formed<br>
between the annular grooves 525,526. In a position of use, as<br>
shown in Fig. 4, the outer engaging end 524 is frictionally<br>
engaged with the inner surrounding engaging region 514 such<br>
that the annular grooves 525,526 and the retained region 527<br>
are projected outwardly of the pushing segment 51.<br>
The deformable sealing member 6 includes a head end wall<br>
613 which has a periphery and which confronts the surrounding<br>
shoulder 24, an upper sealing end 615 which is integrally formed<br>
with the periphery of the head end wall 613 and which is in<br>
fluid-tight and slidable engagement with the rear<br>
larger-diameter portion, and a deformable surrounding wall 612<br>
which extends from the upper sealing end 615 rearwardly and<br>
which terminates at a surrounding trailing end 616 that is<br>
configured to drag on and to be in fluid-tight engagement with<br>
the rear larger-diameter portion. The deformable surrounding<br>
wall 612 has an outer surrounding wall surface 622 which is<br>
spaced apart from the rear larger-diameter portion in radial<br>
directions when the syringe is in the position of use so as<br>
to cooperative with the upper sealing end 615 and the surrounding<br>
trailing end 616 to define an annular compressible chamber 621<br>
thereamong, thereby vesting the deformable surrounding wall<br>
612 with an increased radial flexibility. The deformable<br>
surrounding wall 612 further has an inner surrounding wall<br>
surface 617 opposite to the outer surrounding wall surface 622<br>
in radial directions. The inner surrounding wall surface 617<br>
has a yielding segment 610 which is engaged with and which is<br>
depressed by the pushing region 516 radially when the carrier<br>
5 is moved in a longitudinal direction relative to the deformable<br>
surrounding wall 612 so as to bring the head end wall 613 to<br>
abut against and to be retained at the surrounding shoulder<br>
24, thereby displacing the syringe from the position of use<br>
to a disposal position, and a retaining segment 618 which is<br>
in a first frictional engagement with the retained region 527<br>
by virtue of a first frictional force so as to confine, in<br>
cooperationwith the yielding segment 610 and the pushing region<br>
516, a fluid-tight surrounding area. Thus, referring to Figs.<br>
5 to 7, subsequent to the abutment of the head end wall 613<br>
against the surrounding shoulder 24, the yielding segment 610<br>
is depressed by the pushing region 516 radially and outwardly<br><br>
to result in deformation of the deformable surrounding wall<br>
612, which moves the inner surrounding wall surface 617 radially<br>
and towards the rear larger-diameter portion so as to diminish<br>
the first frictional force, thereby disrupting the<br>
fluid-tightness of the surrounding area and rendering the<br>
syringe unreusable. Subsequent to the disruption of the<br>
fluid-tightness of the surrounding area, the head portion 523<br>
is blocked by the surrounding shoulder 24 from moving further<br>
so as to permit movement of the pushing segment 51 relative<br>
to the retained segment 52 such that the outer surrounding<br>
retained wall 521 is brought into a second f rictional engagement<br>
with the inner surrounding engaging region 514 . Meanwhile, the<br>
deformable surrounding wall 612 is deformed to squeeze the air<br>
out of the annular compressible chamber 621 so that the outer<br>
surrounding wall surface 622 is tightly attached to the rear<br>
larger-diameter portion. Subsequently, referring to Fig. 8,<br>
when the carrier 5 is moved rearwards by the plunger 4 towards<br>
the rearward opening 232, the carrier 5 is disengaged from the<br>
deformable sealing member 6.<br>
Referring to Fig. 9, the second preferred embodiment of<br>
a single-use syringe according to this invention is shown to<br>
be similar to the previous embodiment in construction. The<br>
syringe of this embodiment further includes a passageway<br>
interrupting member 62 3 which is integrally formed with the<br>
head end wall 613 of the deformable sealing member 6 such that<br>
once the fluid-tightness of the surrounding area is disrupted,<br>
the passageway interrupting member 62 3 is forced by the head<br><br>
end wall 613 to extend into the front passageway 22. The<br>
passageway interrupt ing member 623 has a plurality of f rictional<br>
ribs 625 disposed thereon, and a diameter larger than that of<br>
the front passageway 22 so as to be in a frictional engagement<br>
with the front smaller-diameter portion. Thus, the diminution<br>
of the first frictional force enables disengagement of the<br>
retained region 527 from the retaining segment 618, thereby<br>
facilitating disengagement of the deformable sealing member<br>
6 from the carrier 5 when the carrier 5 is moved rearwardly<br>
by the plunger 4 toward the rearward opening 232 . Alternatively,<br>
referring to Fig. 10, the passageway interrupting member 62 3<br>
has a longer length so as to plug the entire front passageway<br>
22 for minimizing the amount of medication remaining in the<br>
barrel 2.<br>
Referring to Figs. 11 to 13, the third preferred embodiment<br>
of a single-use syringe according to this invention is shown<br>
to be similar to the first preferred embodiment in construction.<br>
The carrier 5 of this embodiment further includes a projection<br>
member 53 which is integrally formed with the head portion 523<br>
and which extends forwardly through a slit 619 in the head end<br>
wall 613 of the deformable sealing member 6. The projection<br>
member 53 has a diameter slightly smaller than that of the front<br>
passageway 22, and is moved with the head portion 523 by the<br>
plunger 4 to be inserted into the front passageway 22 in an<br>
injection stroke for reducing the amount of medication left<br>
in the barrel 2. When the carrier 5 is moved rearwardly, the<br>
projection member 53 is moved to disengage from the head end<br><br>
wall 613 of the deformable sealing member 6 so as to completely-<br>
disrupt the fluid-tightness of the surrounding area. In a<br>
modified form of the embodiment, as shown in Fig. 14, the<br>
projection member 53 has a longer length so as to plug the entire<br>
front passageway 22 for minimizing the amount of medication<br>
remaining in the barrel 2.<br>
Referring to Figs . 15 and 16, the fourth preferred embodiment<br>
of a single-use syringe according to this invention is shown<br>
to be similar to the first preferred embodiment in construction.<br>
The syringe of this embodiment further includes a passageway<br>
interrupting member 63 which is integrally formed with the head<br>
portion 523 of the carrier 5 and which projects outwardly of<br>
the head end wall 613 of the deformable sealing member 6 through<br>
a slit 619 in the head end wall 613 . The passageway interrupting<br>
member 63 has a plurality of frictional ribs 631 formed thereon,<br>
and a diameter larger than that of the front passageway 22 so<br>
as to be; in frictional engagement with the front<br>
smaller-diameter portion and so as to enable the head portion<br>
523 to abut against the head end wall 613 . When the tail portion<br>
517 of the carrier 5 is moved rearwardly by the plunger 4 toward<br>
the rearward opening 232, the pushing segment 51 is disengaged<br>
from the retained segment 52 to completely disrupt the<br>
fluid-tightness of the surrounding area for rendering the<br>
syringe unreusable.<br>
Referring to Fig. 17, a modified form of the syringe of<br>
the fourth preferred embodiment is shown to comprise a<br>
passageway interrupting member 64 which has a length sufficient<br><br>
to fully plug the front passageway 22. The passageway<br>
interrupting member 64 has a rear end segment 642 formed with<br>
a plurality of frictional ribs 641, and a front end segment<br>
643 with a diameter smaller than that of the front passageway<br>
22. Referring to Fig. 18, another modified form of the syringe<br>
of the fourth preferred embodiment is shown to comprise a<br>
passageway interrupting member 65 which has two prongs 651 that<br>
project outwardly of the forward opening 231 to acquire a biasing<br>
force so as to reinforce plugging-in engagement of the<br>
passageway interrupting member 65 with the front<br>
smaller-diameter portion.<br>
Referring to Figs. 19 to 21, the fifth preferred embodiment<br>
of a single-use syringe according to this invention is shown<br>
to be similar to the first preferred embodiment in construction.<br>
In this embodiment, the carrier 5 and the plunger 4 are an<br>
integrally formed structure. The carrier 5 includes a tail<br>
portion 517 with a plurality of rib plates 518, and an<br>
intermediate surrounding portion extending forwardly from the<br>
tail portion 517 to terminate at a head portion 523. The<br>
intermediate surrounding portion has a pushing region 516 to<br>
depress the yielding segment 610 of the deformable sealing<br>
member 6, and a retained region 52 7 in frictional engagement<br>
with the retaining segment 618 of the deformable sealing member<br>
6. The carrier 5 has an insert bore 56 extending from the head<br>
portion 523 along the axis (X) to acquire a radial flexibility<br>
so as to facilitate movement of the carrier 5 relative to the<br>
deformable sealing member 6 after abutment of the head end wall<br><br>
613 against the surrounding shoulder 24.<br>
Referring to Figs . 22 and 23 , the sixth preferred embodiment<br>
of a single-use syringe according to this invention is shown<br>
to be similar to the fifth preferred embodiment in construction.<br>
The syringe of this embodiment further includes a passageway<br>
interrupting member 623 which is integrally formed with the<br>
head end wall 613 of the deformable sealing member 6, and which<br>
has a plurality of frictional ribs 625 disposed thereon and<br>
having a diameter larger than that of the front passageway 22<br>
so as to be in a frictional engagement with the front<br>
smaller-diameter portion, thereby facilitating disengagement<br>
of the deformable sealing member 6 from the carrier 5 when the<br>
carrier 5 is moved rearwardly by the plunger 4 . Alternatively,<br>
referring to Fig. 23, the passageway interrupting member 623<br>
may have a longer length so as to plug the entire front passageway<br>
22 for minimizing the amount of medication remaining in the<br>
barrel 2.<br>
Referring to Figs . 24 to 26, the seventh preferred embodiment<br>
of a single-use syringe according to this invention is shown<br>
to be similar to the fifth preferred embodiment in construction.<br>
In this embodiment, the head portion 523 of the carrier 5 has<br>
an inner peripheral grip wall 55 which defines an insert bore<br>
56 extending along the axis (X) through the intermediate<br>
surrounding portion such that the inner peripheral grip wall<br>
55 acquires a radial flexibility, thereby yielding radially<br>
and towards the axis (X) to the first frictional force of the<br>
first frictional engagement between the retaining segment 618<br><br>
and the retained region 527. The syringe further comprises a<br>
passageway interrupting member 67 . The passageway interrupting<br>
member 67 has a gripped end 674 which is retained in the insert<br>
bore 56 when the inner peripheral grip wall 55 yields to the<br>
first frictional force and which has a plurality of frictional<br>
ribs 673 formed thereon, a plug head 677 which is opposite to<br>
the gripped end 674 in the longitudinal direction and which<br>
extends f orwardly and outwardly of the head end wall 613 through<br>
a slit 619, and an abutment ring 672 which is disposed between<br>
the gripped end 674 and the plug head 677. The plug head 677<br>
has a plurality of frictional ribs 675 formed thereon. Therefore,<br>
once the fluid-tightness of the surrounding area is disrupted,<br>
the plug head 677 plugs the front passageway 22 with the abutment<br>
ring 672 abutting against the head end wall 613 . Referring to<br>
Fig. 25, in a modified form of the seventh preferred embodiment,<br>
the passageway interrupting member 68 has a length sufficient<br>
to fully plug the front passageway 22 for minimizing the amount<br>
of medication remaining in the barrel 2 . The plug head 686 of<br>
the passageway interrupting member 68 has a rear segment formed<br>
with a plurality of frictional ribs 685, and a front end segment<br>
687 with a diameter smaller than that of the front passageway<br>
22. Alternatively, in another modified form of the syringe of<br>
the seventh preferred embodiment shown in Fig. 26, the<br>
passageway interrupting member 69 has two prongs 695 that<br>
project outwardly of the forward opening 231 to acquire a biasing<br>
force to reinforce plugging-in engagement of the passageway<br>
interrupt ing member 69 with the front smaller-diameterportion.<br><br>
Referring to Fig. 27, the eighth preferred embodiment of<br>
a single-use syringe according to this invention is shown to<br>
be similar to the seventh preferred embodiment in construction.<br>
In this embodiment, each of the passageway interrupting members<br>
67,68,69 that are selectively insertable into the insert bore<br>
56 is not formed with an abutment ring so as to simplify the<br>
structure thereof.<br>
Referring to Fig. 28, the ninth preferred embodiment of<br>
a single-use syringe according to this invention is shown to<br>
be similar to the eighth preferred embodiment in construction.<br>
As shown, the pushing region 516 of the carrier 5 has a relatively<br>
smooth surface. Although the yielding segment 610 of the<br>
deformable sealing member 6 is depressed by the pushing region<br>
516 so that the deformable surrounding wall 612 is partly<br>
attached to the rear larger-diameter portion of the barrel 2,<br>
thedeformable seal ing member 6 maybe retained by the passageway<br>
interrupting member 67,68,69 after the carrier 5 is moved<br>
rearwardly.<br>
Referring to Figs . 29 and 3D, the tenth preferred embodiment<br>
of a single-use syringe according to this invention is shown<br>
to be similar to the sixth preferred embodiment in construction.<br>
In this embodiment, the carrier 5 has two annular teeth formed<br>
on the intermediate surrounding portion to respectively serve<br>
as the pushing region 516 and the retained region 527. The<br>
deformable surrounding wall 612 has two annular grooves formed<br>
in the inner surrounding wall surface to respectively serve<br>
as the yielding segment 610 and the retaining segment 618, and<br><br>
a moving space 66 formed forwardly of the annular grooves.<br>
Therefore, subsequent to the abutment of the head end wall 613<br>
against the surrounding shoulder 24 , the carrier 5 can be forced<br>
to move forwardly relative to the deformable sealing member<br>
6 to insert, into the moving space 66 so as to diminish the first<br>
frictional force upon the first frictional engagement, of the<br>
retained region 527 with the retaining segment 618, thereby<br>
disrupting the fluid-tightness of the surrounding area for<br>
rendering the syringe unreusable. Alternatively, the<br>
passageway interrupting member 623 may have a length sufficient<br>
to plug the entire front passageway 22 for minimizing the; amount<br>
of medication remaining in the barrel 2, as shown in Fig. 31.<br>
Referring to Figs. 32 and 33, the eleventh preferred<br>
embodiment of a single-use syringe according to this invention<br>
is shown to be similar to the tenth preferred embodiment in<br>
construction. In this embodiment, the passageway interrupting<br>
member 67 has a gripped end 674 which is retained in the insert<br>
bore 56 when the inner peripheral grip wall 55 yields to the<br>
first frictional force of the first frictional engagement<br>
between the retaining segment 618 and the retained region 527<br>
and which has a plurality of frictional ribs 673 formed thereon,<br>
and a plug head 677 which extends forwardly and outwardly of<br>
the head end wall 613 through a slit 619 in the head end wall<br>
613, and which has a plurality of frictional ribs 675 formed<br>
thereon. The diminution of the first frictional force upon the<br>
first frictional engagement of the retained region 52 7 with<br>
the retaining segment 618 lessens the degree of yielding towards<br><br>
the axis (X) so as to permit the inner peripheral grip wall<br>
55 to release the gripped end 674, thereby permitting the plug<br>
head 677 to be retained in the front passageway 22 when the<br>
carrier 5 is moved in the longitudinal direction relative to<br>
the deformable surrounding wall 612.<br>
Furthermore, the intermediate surrounding portion of the<br>
carrier 5 further has a pulling region 57 which is disposed<br>
rearwardly of the pushing region 516. The inner surrounding<br>
wall surface of the deformable surrounding wall 612 has a pulled<br>
segment 62 which is disposed between the yielding segment 610<br>
and the retaining segment 618. Therefore, subsequent to the<br>
movement of the carrier 5 into the moving space 66 to disrupt<br>
the fluid-tightness of the surrounding area, the pulling region<br>
57 is displaced to abut against the pulled segment 62 such that<br>
the pulling region 57 is forced by a rearward movement of the<br>
carrier 5 to depress the pulled segment 62 to move towards the<br>
rearward opening 232, thereby permitting movement of the<br>
deformable sealing member 6 with the carrier 5 so as to bring<br>
the plug head 677 to disengage from the head end wall 613 of<br>
the deformable sealing member 6 when the plug head 677 is retained<br>
in the front passageway 22.<br>
In the modified form of the eleventh preferred embodiment<br>
as shown in Fig. 34, the passageway interrupting member 68 has<br>
a length sufficient to plug the entire front passageway 22 for<br>
minimizing the amount of medication remaining in the barrel<br>
2. The plug head 686 of the passageway interrupting member 68<br>
has a rear segment formed with a plurality of frictional ribs<br><br>
685, and a front end segment 687 with a diameter smaller than<br>
that of the front passageway 22 . Referring to Fig. 35, in another<br>
modified form of the syringe of the eleventh preferred<br>
embodiment, the passageway interrupting member 69 which has<br>
two prongs 695 that project outwardly of the forward opening<br>
231 to acquire a biasing force to reinforce plugging-in<br>
engagement of the passageway interrupting member 69 with the<br>
front smaller-diameter portion.<br>
Referring to Figs. 36 and 37, the twelfth preferred<br>
embodiment of a single-use syringe according to this invention<br>
is shown to be similar to the eleventh preferred embodiment<br>
in construction. In this embodiment, the intermediate<br>
surrounding portion of the carrier 5 includes a tubular pushing<br>
segment 51 with the pushing region 516, and a tubular retained<br>
segment 52 with the retained region 527. The pushing segment<br>
51has an insert bore 56 extending along the axis (X) . The retained<br>
segment 52 has a grip portion 52 8 which is retained in the insert<br>
bore 56, and which has a plurality of frictional ribs 529 formed<br>
thereon. The passageway interrupting member 67 is integrally<br>
formed with the head portion 523, extends forwardly and<br>
outwardly of the head end wall 613 through the slit 619, and<br>
has a plurality of frictional ribs 675 formed thereon. Therefore,<br>
subsequent to the disruption of the fluid-tightness of the<br>
surrounding area, the head port ion 523 is brought to abut cigainst<br>
the head end wall 613 so as to permit the passageway interrupting<br>
member 67 to plug the front passageway 22.<br>
In the modified form of the twelfth preferred embodiment<br><br>
as shown in Fig. 38, the passageway interrupting member 68 has<br>
a length sufficient to plug the entire front passageway 22 for<br>
minimizing the amount of medication remaining in the barrel<br>
2 . The passageway interrupting member 68 has a rear segment<br>
formed with a plurality of frictional ribs 685, and a front<br>
end segment 687 with a diameter smaller than that of the front<br>
passageway 22. Referring to Fig. 39, in another modified form<br>
of the syringe of the twelfth preferred embodiment, the<br>
passageway interrupting member 69 has two prongs 695 that<br>
project outwardly of the forward opening 231 to acquire a biasing<br>
force to reinforce plugging-in engagement of the passageway<br>
interrupt ing member 69 with the front smaller-diameter portion.<br>
As illustrated, in the syringe of this invention, during<br>
displacement of the syringe from the position of use to the<br>
disposal position, the first frictional force, by which the<br>
retaining segment 618 of the deformable sealing member 6 is<br>
in frictional engagement with the retained region 52 7 of the<br>
carrier 5, is diminished when the yielding segment 610 is<br>
depressed by the pushing region 516, thereby facilitating<br>
release of the retained region 527 from the retaining segment<br>
618 to ensure disruption of the fluid-tightness of the<br>
surrounding area for rendering the syringe unreusable . Moreover,<br>
the passageway interrupting member 623,63,64,65,67,68,69 is<br>
provided to plug the front passageway 22 of the barrel 2 even<br>
when the plunger 4 is moved rearwardly, thereby preventing the<br>
syringe from being reused. Also, the passageway interrupting<br>
member 623,63,64,65,67,68,69 can be coupled with one of the<br><br>
head portion 523 of the carrier 5 and the head end wall 613<br>
of the deformable sealing member 6. Therefore, the barrel 2,<br>
the carrier 5, the plunger 4, and the passageway interrupting<br>
member can be fabricated conveniently without the need to modify<br>
the barrel 2.<br>
